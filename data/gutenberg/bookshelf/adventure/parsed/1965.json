HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. THE MESSENGER\n\n\nPeter Blood, bachelor of medicine and several other things besides,\nsmoked a pipe and tended the geraniums boxed on the sill of his window\nabove Water Lane in the town of Bridgewater.\n\nSternly disapproving eyes considered him from a window opposite, but\nwent disregarded. Mr. Blood's attention was divided between his task and\nthe stream of humanity in the narrow street below; a stream which poured\nfor the second time that day towards Castle Field, where earlier in\nthe afternoon Ferguson, the Duke's chaplain, had preached a sermon\ncontaining more treason than divinity.\n\nThese straggling, excited groups were mainly composed of men with green\nboughs in their hats and the most ludicrous of weapons in their hands.\nSome, it is true, shouldered fowling pieces, and here and there a sword\nwas brandished; but more of them were armed with clubs, and most of them\ntrailed the mammoth pikes fashioned out of scythes, as formidable to\nthe eye as they were clumsy to the hand. There were weavers, brewers,\ncarpenters, smiths, masons, bricklayers, cobblers, and representatives\nof every other of the trades of peace among these improvised men of war.\nBridgewater, like Taunton, had yielded so generously of its manhood to\nthe service of the bastard Duke that for any to abstain whose age and\nstrength admitted of his bearing arms was to brand himself a coward or a\npapist.\n\nYet Peter Blood, who was not only able to bear arms, but trained and\nskilled in their use, who was certainly no coward, and a papist only\nwhen it suited him, tended his geraniums and smoked his pipe on that\nwarm July evening as indifferently as if nothing were afoot. One other\nthing he did. He flung after those war-fevered enthusiasts a line of\nHorace--a poet for whose work he had early conceived an inordinate\naffection:\n\n\"Quo, quo, scelesti, ruitis?\"\n\nAnd now perhaps you guess why the hot, intrepid blood inherited from the\nroving sires of his Somersetshire mother remained cool amidst all this\nfrenzied fanatical heat of rebellion; why the turbulent spirit which had\nforced him once from the sedate academical bonds his father would\nhave imposed upon him, should now remain quiet in the very midst of\nturbulence. You realize how he regarded these men who were rallying to\nthe banners of liberty--the banners woven by the virgins of Taunton, the\ngirls from the seminaries of Miss Blake and Mrs. Musgrove, who--as the\nballad runs--had ripped open their silk petticoats to make colours for\nKing Monmouth's army. That Latin line, contemptuously flung after them\nas they clattered down the cobbled street, reveals his mind. To him they\nwere fools rushing in wicked frenzy upon their ruin.\n\nYou see, he knew too much about this fellow Monmouth and the pretty\nbrown slut who had borne him, to be deceived by the legend of\nlegitimacy, on the strength of which this standard of rebellion had\nbeen raised. He had read the absurd proclamation posted at the Cross\nat Bridgewater--as it had been posted also at Taunton and\nelsewhere--setting forth that \"upon the decease of our Sovereign Lord\nCharles the Second, the right of succession to the Crown of England,\nScotland, France, and Ireland, with the dominions and territories\nthereunto belonging, did legally descend and devolve upon the most\nillustrious and high-born Prince James, Duke of Monmouth, son and heir\napparent to the said King Charles the Second.\"\n\nIt had moved him to laughter, as had the further announcement that\n\"James Duke of York did first cause the said late King to be poysoned,\nand immediately thereupon did usurp and invade the Crown.\"\n\nHe knew not which was the greater lie. For Mr. Blood had spent a third\nof his life in the Netherlands, where this same James Scott--who now\nproclaimed himself James the Second, by the grace of God, King, et\ncetera--first saw the light some six-and-thirty years ago, and he was\nacquainted with the story current there of the fellow's real paternity.\nFar from being legitimate--by virtue of a pretended secret marriage\nbetween Charles Stuart and Lucy Walter--it was possible that this\nMonmouth who now proclaimed himself King of England was not even the\nillegitimate child of the late sovereign. What but ruin and disaster\ncould be the end of this grotesque pretension? How could it be hoped\nthat England would ever swallow such a Perkin? And it was on his behalf,\nto uphold his fantastic claim, that these West Country clods, led by a\nfew armigerous Whigs, had been seduced into rebellion!\n\n\"Quo, quo, scelesti, ruitis?\"\n\nHe laughed and sighed in one; but the laugh dominated the sigh, for Mr.\nBlood was unsympathetic, as are most self-sufficient men; and he\nwas very self-sufficient; adversity had taught him so to be. A more\ntender-hearted man, possessing his vision and his knowledge, might have\nfound cause for tears in the contemplation of these ardent, simple,\nNonconformist sheep going forth to the shambles--escorted to the\nrallying ground on Castle Field by wives and daughters, sweethearts and\nmothers, sustained by the delusion that they were to take the field\nin defence of Right, of Liberty, and of Religion. For he knew, as\nall Bridgewater knew and had known now for some hours, that it was\nMonmouth's intention to deliver battle that same night. The Duke was to\nlead a surprise attack upon the Royalist army under Feversham that was\nnow encamped on Sedgemoor. Mr. Blood assumed that Lord Feversham would\nbe equally well-informed, and if in this assumption he was wrong,\nat least he was justified of it. He was not to suppose the Royalist\ncommander so indifferently skilled in the trade he followed.\n\nMr. Blood knocked the ashes from his pipe, and drew back to close his\nwindow. As he did so, his glance travelling straight across the street\nmet at last the glance of those hostile eyes that watched him. There\nwere two pairs, and they belonged to the Misses Pitt, two amiable,\nsentimental maiden ladies who yielded to none in Bridgewater in their\nworship of the handsome Monmouth.\n\nMr. Blood smiled and inclined his head, for he was on friendly terms\nwith these ladies, one of whom, indeed, had been for a little while his\npatient. But there was no response to his greeting. Instead, the eyes\ngave him back a stare of cold disdain. The smile on his thin lips grew a\nlittle broader, a little less pleasant. He understood the reason of that\nhostility, which had been daily growing in this past week since Monmouth\nhad come to turn the brains of women of all ages. The Misses Pitt,\nhe apprehended, contemned him that he, a young and vigorous man, of a\nmilitary training which might now be valuable to the Cause, should stand\naloof; that he should placidly smoke his pipe and tend his geraniums on\nthis evening of all evenings, when men of spirit were rallying to the\nProtestant Champion, offering their blood to place him on the throne\nwhere he belonged.\n\nIf Mr. Blood had condescended to debate the matter with these ladies, he\nmight have urged that having had his fill of wandering and adventuring,\nhe was now embarked upon the career for which he had been originally\nintended and for which his studies had equipped him; that he was a man\nof medicine and not of war; a healer, not a slayer. But they would have\nanswered him, he knew, that in such a cause it behoved every man who\ndeemed himself a man to take up arms. They would have pointed out that\ntheir own nephew Jeremiah, who was by trade a sailor, the master of a\nship--which by an ill-chance for that young man had come to anchor at\nthis season in Bridgewater Bay--had quitted the helm to snatch up a\nmusket in defence of Right. But Mr. Blood was not of those who argue. As\nI have said, he was a self-sufficient man.\n\nHe closed the window, drew the curtains, and turned to the pleasant,\ncandle-lighted room, and the table on which Mrs. Barlow, his\nhousekeeper, was in the very act of spreading supper. To her, however,\nhe spoke aloud his thought.\n\n\"It's out of favour I am with the vinegary virgins over the way.\"\n\nHe had a pleasant, vibrant voice, whose metallic ring was softened and\nmuted by the Irish accent which in all his wanderings he had never lost.\nIt was a voice that could woo seductively and caressingly, or command in\nsuch a way as to compel obedience. Indeed, the man's whole nature was in\nthat voice of his. For the rest of him, he was tall and spare, swarthy\nof tint as a gipsy, with eyes that were startlingly blue in that dark\nface and under those level black brows. In their glance those eyes,\nflanking a high-bridged, intrepid nose, were of singular penetration\nand of a steady haughtiness that went well with his firm lips. Though\ndressed in black as became his calling, yet it was with an elegance\nderived from the love of clothes that is peculiar to the adventurer he\nhad been, rather than to the staid medicus he now was. His coat was of\nfine camlet, and it was laced with silver; there were ruffles of Mechlin\nat his wrists and a Mechlin cravat encased his throat. His great black\nperiwig was as sedulously curled as any at Whitehall.\n\nSeeing him thus, and perceiving his real nature, which was plain upon\nhim, you might have been tempted to speculate how long such a man would\nbe content to lie by in this little backwater of the world into which\nchance had swept him some six months ago; how long he would continue to\npursue the trade for which he had qualified himself before he had begun\nto live. Difficult of belief though it may be when you know his history,\nprevious and subsequent, yet it is possible that but for the trick\nthat Fate was about to play him, he might have continued this peaceful\nexistence, settling down completely to the life of a doctor in this\nSomersetshire haven. It is possible, but not probable.\n\nHe was the son of an Irish medicus, by a Somersetshire lady in whose\nveins ran the rover blood of the Frobishers, which may account for a\ncertain wildness that had early manifested itself in his disposition.\nThis wildness had profoundly alarmed his father, who for an Irishman was\nof a singularly peace-loving nature. He had early resolved that the\nboy should follow his own honourable profession, and Peter Blood, being\nquick to learn and oddly greedy of knowledge, had satisfied his parent\nby receiving at the age of twenty the degree of baccalaureus medicinae\nat Trinity College, Dublin. His father survived that satisfaction by\nthree months only. His mother had then been dead some years already.\nThus Peter Blood came into an inheritance of some few hundred pounds,\nwith which he had set out to see the world and give for a season a free\nrein to that restless spirit by which he was imbued. A set of curious\nchances led him to take service with the Dutch, then at war with France;\nand a predilection for the sea made him elect that this service should\nbe upon that element. He had the advantage of a commission under the\nfamous de Ruyter, and fought in the Mediterranean engagement in which\nthat great Dutch admiral lost his life.\n\nAfter the Peace of Nimeguen his movements are obscure. But we know that\nhe spent two years in a Spanish prison, though we do not know how he\ncontrived to get there. It may be due to this that upon his release\nhe took his sword to France, and saw service with the French in their\nwarring upon the Spanish Netherlands. Having reached, at last, the age\nof thirty-two, his appetite for adventure surfeited, his health having\ngrown indifferent as the result of a neglected wound, he was suddenly\noverwhelmed by homesickness. He took ship from Nantes with intent to\ncross to Ireland. But the vessel being driven by stress of weather\ninto Bridgewater Bay, and Blood's health having grown worse during the\nvoyage, he decided to go ashore there, additionally urged to it by the\nfact that it was his mother's native soil.\n\nThus in January of that year 1685 he had come to Bridgewater, possessor\nof a fortune that was approximately the same as that with which he had\noriginally set out from Dublin eleven years ago.\n\nBecause he liked the place, in which his health was rapidly restored\nto him, and because he conceived that he had passed through adventures\nenough for a man's lifetime, he determined to settle there, and take\nup at last the profession of medicine from which he had, with so little\nprofit, broken away.\n\nThat is all his story, or so much of it as matters up to that night, six\nmonths later, when the battle of Sedgemoor was fought.\n\nDeeming the impending action no affair of his, as indeed it was not, and\nindifferent to the activity with which Bridgewater was that night agog,\nMr. Blood closed his ears to the sounds of it, and went early to bed. He\nwas peacefully asleep long before eleven o'clock, at which hour, as\nyou know, Monmouth rode but with his rebel host along the Bristol Road,\ncircuitously to avoid the marshland that lay directly between himself\nand the Royal Army. You also know that his numerical advantage--possibly\ncounter-balanced by the greater steadiness of the regular troops on the\nother side--and the advantages he derived from falling by surprise upon\nan army that was more or less asleep, were all lost to him by blundering\nand bad leadership before ever he was at grips with Feversham.\n\nThe armies came into collision in the neighbourhood of two o'clock in\nthe morning. Mr. Blood slept undisturbed through the distant boom of\ncannon. Not until four o'clock, when the sun was rising to dispel the\nlast wisps of mist over that stricken field of battle, did he awaken\nfrom his tranquil slumbers.\n\nHe sat up in bed, rubbed the sleep from his eyes, and collected himself.\nBlows were thundering upon the door of his house, and a voice was\ncalling incoherently. This was the noise that had aroused him.\nConceiving that he had to do with some urgent obstetrical case, he\nreached for bedgown and slippers, to go below. On the landing he almost\ncollided with Mrs. Barlow, new-risen and unsightly, in a state of panic.\nHe quieted her cluckings with a word of reassurance, and went himself to\nopen.\n\nThere in slanting golden light of the new-risen sun stood a breathless,\nwild-eyed man and a steaming horse. Smothered in dust and grime, his\nclothes in disarray, the left sleeve of his doublet hanging in rags,\nthis young man opened his lips to speak, yet for a long moment remained\nspeechless.\n\nIn that moment Mr. Blood recognized him for the young shipmaster,\nJeremiah Pitt, the nephew of the maiden ladies opposite, one who had\nbeen drawn by the general enthusiasm into the vortex of that rebellion.\nThe street was rousing, awakened by the sailor's noisy advent; doors\nwere opening, and lattices were being unlatched for the protrusion of\nanxious, inquisitive heads.\n\n\"Take your time, now,\" said Mr. Blood. \"I never knew speed made by\noverhaste.\"\n\nBut the wild-eyed lad paid no heed to the admonition. He plunged,\nheadlong, into speech, gasping, breathless.\n\n\"It is Lord Gildoy,\" he panted. \"He is sore wounded... at Oglethorpe's\nFarm by the river. I bore him thither... and... and he sent me for you.\nCome away! Come away!\"\n\nHe would have clutched the doctor, and haled him forth by force in\nbedgown and slippers as he was. But the doctor eluded that too eager\nhand.\n\n\"To be sure, I'll come,\" said he. He was distressed. Gildoy had been a\nvery friendly, generous patron to him since his settling in these parts.\nAnd Mr. Blood was eager enough to do what he now could to discharge\nthe debt, grieved that the occasion should have arisen, and in such a\nmanner--for he knew quite well that the rash young nobleman had been an\nactive agent of the Duke's. \"To be sure, I'll come. But first give me\nleave to get some clothes and other things that I may need.\"\n\n\"There's no time to lose.\"\n\n\"Be easy now. I'll lose none. I tell ye again, ye'll go quickest by\ngoing leisurely. Come in... take a chair...\" He threw open the door of a\nparlour.\n\nYoung Pitt waved aside the invitation.\n\n\"I'll wait here. Make haste, in God's name.\" Mr. Blood went off to dress\nand to fetch a case of instruments.\n\nQuestions concerning the precise nature of Lord Gildoy's hurt could wait\nuntil they were on their way. Whilst he pulled on his boots, he gave\nMrs. Barlow instructions for the day, which included the matter of a\ndinner he was not destined to eat.\n\nWhen at last he went forth again, Mrs. Barlow clucking after him like\na disgruntled fowl, he found young Pitt smothered in a crowd of scared,\nhalf-dressed townsfolk--mostly women--who had come hastening for news\nof how the battle had sped. The news he gave them was to be read in the\nlamentations with which they disturbed the morning air.\n\nAt sight of the doctor, dressed and booted, the case of instruments\ntucked under his arm, the messenger disengaged himself from those who\npressed about, shook off his weariness and the two tearful aunts that\nclung most closely, and seizing the bridle of his horse, he climbed to\nthe saddle.\n\n\"Come along, sir,\" he cried. \"Mount behind me.\"\n\nMr. Blood, without wasting words, did as he was bidden. Pitt touched\nthe horse with his spur. The little crowd gave way, and thus, upon\nthe crupper of that doubly-laden horse, clinging to the belt of his\ncompanion, Peter Blood set out upon his Odyssey. For this Pitt, in whom\nhe beheld no more than the messenger of a wounded rebel gentleman, was\nindeed the very messenger of Fate.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. KIRKE'S DRAGOONS\n\n\nOglethorpe's farm stood a mile or so to the south of Bridgewater on the\nright bank of the river. It was a straggling Tudor building showing grey\nabove the ivy that clothed its lower parts. Approaching it now, through\nthe fragrant orchards amid which it seemed to drowse in Arcadian peace\nbeside the waters of the Parrett, sparkling in the morning sunlight,\nMr. Blood might have had a difficulty in believing it part of a world\ntormented by strife and bloodshed.\n\nOn the bridge, as they had been riding out of Bridgewater, they had met\na vanguard of fugitives from the field of battle, weary, broken men,\nmany of them wounded, all of them terror-stricken, staggering in\nspeedless haste with the last remnants of their strength into the\nshelter which it was their vain illusion the town would afford them.\nEyes glazed with lassitude and fear looked up piteously out of haggard\nfaces at Mr. Blood and his companion as they rode forth; hoarse voices\ncried a warning that merciless pursuit was not far behind. Undeterred,\nhowever, young Pitt rode amain along the dusty road by which these\npoor fugitives from that swift rout on Sedgemoor came flocking in\never-increasing numbers. Presently he swung aside, and quitting the road\ntook to a pathway that crossed the dewy meadowlands. Even here they\nmet odd groups of these human derelicts, who were scattering in all\ndirections, looking fearfully behind them as they came through the long\ngrass, expecting at every moment to see the red coats of the dragoons.\n\nBut as Pitt's direction was a southward one, bringing them ever nearer\nto Feversham's headquarters, they were presently clear of that human\nflotsam and jetsam of the battle, and riding through the peaceful\norchards heavy with the ripening fruit that was soon to make its annual\nyield of cider.\n\nAt last they alighted on the kidney stones of the courtyard, and Baynes,\nthe master, of the homestead, grave of countenance and flustered of\nmanner, gave them welcome.\n\nIn the spacious, stone-flagged hall, the doctor found Lord\nGildoy--a very tall and dark young gentleman, prominent of chin and\nnose--stretched on a cane day-bed under one of the tall mullioned\nwindows, in the care of Mrs. Baynes and her comely daughter. His cheeks\nwere leaden-hued, his eyes closed, and from his blue lips came with each\nlaboured breath a faint, moaning noise.\n\nMr. Blood stood for a moment silently considering his patient. He\ndeplored that a youth with such bright hopes in life as Lord Gildoy's\nshould have risked all, perhaps existence itself, to forward the\nambition of a worthless adventurer. Because he had liked and honoured\nthis brave lad he paid his case the tribute of a sigh. Then he knelt to\nhis task, ripped away doublet and underwear to lay bare his lordship's\nmangled side, and called for water and linen and what else he needed for\nhis work.\n\nHe was still intent upon it a half-hour later when the dragoons invaded\nthe homestead. The clatter of hooves and hoarse shouts that heralded\ntheir approach disturbed him not at all. For one thing, he was not\neasily disturbed; for another, his task absorbed him. But his lordship,\nwho had now recovered consciousness, showed considerable alarm, and the\nbattle-stained Jeremy Pitt sped to cover in a clothes-press. Baynes was\nuneasy, and his wife and daughter trembled. Mr. Blood reassured them.\n\n\"Why, what's to fear?\" he said. \"It's a Christian country, this, and\nChristian men do not make war upon the wounded, nor upon those who\nharbour them.\" He still had, you see, illusions about Christians.\nHe held a glass of cordial, prepared under his directions, to his\nlordship's lips. \"Give your mind peace, my lord. The worst is done.\"\n\nAnd then they came rattling and clanking into the stone-flagged hall--a\nround dozen jack-booted, lobster-coated troopers of the Tangiers\nRegiment, led by a sturdy, black-browed fellow with a deal of gold lace\nabout the breast of his coat.\n\nBaynes stood his ground, his attitude half-defiant, whilst his wife\nand daughter shrank away in renewed fear. Mr. Blood, at the head of the\nday-bed, looked over his shoulder to take stock of the invaders.\n\nThe officer barked an order, which brought his men to an attentive halt,\nthen swaggered forward, his gloved hand bearing down the pummel of\nhis sword, his spurs jingling musically as he moved. He announced his\nauthority to the yeoman.\n\n\"I am Captain Hobart, of Colonel Kirke's dragoons. What rebels do you\nharbour?\"\n\nThe yeoman took alarm at that ferocious truculence. It expressed itself\nin his trembling voice.\n\n\"I... I am no harbourer of rebels, sir. This wounded gentleman....\"\n\n\"I can see for myself.\" The Captain stamped forward to the day-bed, and\nscowled down upon the grey-faced sufferer.\n\n\"No need to ask how he came in this state and by his wounds. A damned\nrebel, and that's enough for me.\" He flung a command at his dragoons.\n\"Out with him, my lads.\"\n\nMr. Blood got between the day-bed and the troopers.\n\n\"In the name of humanity, sir!\" said he, on a note of anger. \"This is\nEngland, not Tangiers. The gentleman is in sore case. He may not be\nmoved without peril to his life.\"\n\nCaptain Hobart was amused.\n\n\"Oh, I am to be tender of the lives of these rebels! Odds blood! Do you\nthink it's to benefit his health we're taking him? There's gallows being\nplanted along the road from Weston to Bridgewater, and he'll serve\nfor one of them as well as another. Colonel Kirke'll learn these\nnonconforming oafs something they'll not forget in generations.\"\n\n\"You're hanging men without trial? Faith, then, it's mistaken I am.\nWe're in Tangiers, after all, it seems, where your regiment belongs.\"\n\nThe Captain considered him with a kindling eye. He looked him over from\nthe soles of his riding-boots to the crown of his periwig. He noted\nthe spare, active frame, the arrogant poise of the head, the air of\nauthority that invested Mr. Blood, and soldier recognized soldier. The\nCaptain's eyes narrowed. Recognition went further.\n\n\"Who the hell may you be?\" he exploded.\n\n\"My name is Blood, sir--Peter Blood, at your service.\"\n\n\"Aye--aye! Codso! That's the name. You were in French service once, were\nyou not?\"\n\nIf Mr. Blood was surprised, he did not betray it.\n\n\"I was.\"\n\n\"Then I remember you--five years ago, or more, you were in Tangiers.\"\n\n\"That is so. I knew your colonel.\"\n\n\"Faith, you may be renewing the acquaintance.\" The Captain laughed\nunpleasantly. \"What brings you here, sir?\"\n\n\"This wounded gentleman. I was fetched to attend him. I am a medicus.\"\n\n\"A doctor--you?\" Scorn of that lie--as he conceived it--rang in the\nheavy, hectoring voice.\n\n\"Medicinae baccalaureus,\" said Mr. Blood.\n\n\"Don't fling your French at me, man,\" snapped Hobart. \"Speak English!\"\n\nMr. Blood's smile annoyed him.\n\n\"I am a physician practising my calling in the town of Bridgewater.\"\n\nThe Captain sneered. \"Which you reached by way of Lyme Regis in the\nfollowing of your bastard Duke.\"\n\nIt was Mr. Blood's turn to sneer. \"If your wit were as big as your\nvoice, my dear, it's the great man you'd be by this.\"\n\nFor a moment the dragoon was speechless. The colour deepened in his\nface.\n\n\"You may find me great enough to hang you.\"\n\n\"Faith, yes. Ye've the look and the manners of a hangman. But if you\npractise your trade on my patient here, you may be putting a rope round\nyour own neck. He's not the kind you may string up and no questions\nasked. He has the right to trial, and the right to trial by his peers.\"\n\n\"By his peers?\"\n\nThe Captain was taken aback by these three words, which Mr. Blood had\nstressed.\n\n\"Sure, now, any but a fool or a savage would have asked his name before\nordering him to the gallows. The gentleman is my Lord Gildoy.\"\n\nAnd then his lordship spoke for himself, in a weak voice.\n\n\"I make no concealment of my association with the Duke of Monmouth.\nI'll take the consequences. But, if you please, I'll take them after\ntrial--by my peers, as the doctor has said.\"\n\nThe feeble voice ceased, and was followed by a moment's silence. As is\ncommon in many blustering men, there was a deal of timidity deep down\nin Hobart. The announcement of his lordship's rank had touched those\ndepths. A servile upstart, he stood in awe of titles. And he stood in\nawe of his colonel. Percy Kirke was not lenient with blunderers.\n\nBy a gesture he checked his men. He must consider. Mr. Blood, observing\nhis pause, added further matter for his consideration.\n\n\"Ye'll be remembering, Captain, that Lord Gildoy will have friends and\nrelatives on the Tory side, who'll have something to say to Colonel\nKirke if his lordship should be handled like a common felon. You'll go\nwarily, Captain, or, as I've said, it's a halter for your neck ye'll be\nweaving this morning.\"\n\nCaptain Hobart swept the warning aside with a bluster of contempt, but\nhe acted upon it none the less. \"Take up the day-bed,\" said he, \"and\nconvey him on that to Bridgewater. Lodge him in the gaol until I take\norder about him.\"\n\n\"He may not survive the journey,\" Blood remonstrated. \"He's in no case\nto be moved.\"\n\n\"So much the worse for him. My affair is to round up rebels.\" He\nconfirmed his order by a gesture. Two of his men took up the day-bed,\nand swung to depart with it.\n\nGildoy made a feeble effort to put forth a hand towards Mr. Blood.\n\"Sir,\" he said, \"you leave me in your debt. If I live I shall study how\nto discharge it.\"\n\nMr. Blood bowed for answer; then to the men: \"Bear him steadily,\" he\ncommanded. \"His life depends on it.\"\n\nAs his lordship was carried out, the Captain became brisk. He turned\nupon the yeoman.\n\n\"What other cursed rebels do you harbour?\"\n\n\"None other, sir. His lordship....\"\n\n\"We've dealt with his lordship for the present. We'll deal with you in\na moment when we've searched your house. And, by God, if you've lied to\nme....\" He broke off, snarling, to give an order. Four of his dragoons\nwent out. In a moment they were heard moving noisily in the adjacent\nroom. Meanwhile, the Captain was questing about the hall, sounding the\nwainscoting with the butt of a pistol.\n\nMr. Blood saw no profit to himself in lingering.\n\n\"By your leave, it's a very good day I'll be wishing you,\" said he.\n\n\"By my leave, you'll remain awhile,\" the Captain ordered him.\n\nMr. Blood shrugged, and sat down. \"You're tiresome,\" he said. \"I wonder\nyour colonel hasn't discovered it yet.\"\n\nBut the Captain did not heed him. He was stooping to pick up a soiled\nand dusty hat in which there was pinned a little bunch of oak leaves. It\nhad been lying near the clothes-press in which the unfortunate Pitt had\ntaken refuge. The Captain smiled malevolently. His eyes raked the room,\nresting first sardonically on the yeoman, then on the two women in the\nbackground, and finally on Mr. Blood, who sat with one leg thrown over\nthe other in an attitude of indifference that was far from reflecting\nhis mind.\n\nThen the Captain stepped to the press, and pulled open one of the wings\nof its massive oaken door. He took the huddled inmate by the collar of\nhis doublet, and lugged him out into the open.\n\n\"And who the devil's this?\" quoth he. \"Another nobleman?\"\n\nMr. Blood had a vision of those gallows of which Captain Hobart had\nspoken, and of this unfortunate young shipmaster going to adorn one of\nthem, strung up without trial, in the place of the other victim of whom\nthe Captain had been cheated. On the spot he invented not only a title\nbut a whole family for the young rebel.\n\n\"Faith, ye've said it, Captain. This is Viscount Pitt, first cousin to\nSir Thomas Vernon, who's married to that slut Moll Kirke, sister to your\nown colonel, and sometime lady in waiting upon King James's queen.\"\n\nBoth the Captain and his prisoner gasped. But whereas thereafter young\nPitt discreetly held his peace, the Captain rapped out a nasty oath. He\nconsidered his prisoner again.\n\n\"He's lying, is he not?\" he demanded, seizing the lad by the shoulder,\nand glaring into his face. \"He's rallying rue, by God!\"\n\n\"If ye believe that,\" said Blood, \"hang him, and see what happens to\nyou.\"\n\nThe dragoon glared at the doctor and then at his prisoner. \"Pah!\"\nHe thrust the lad into the hands of his men. \"Fetch him along to\nBridgewater. And make fast that fellow also,\" he pointed to Baynes.\n\"We'll show him what it means to harbour and comfort rebels.\"\n\nThere was a moment of confusion. Baynes struggled in the grip of the\ntroopers, protesting vehemently. The terrified women screamed until\nsilenced by a greater terror. The Captain strode across to them. He took\nthe girl by the shoulders. She was a pretty, golden-headed creature,\nwith soft blue eyes that looked up entreatingly, piteously into the face\nof the dragoon. He leered upon her, his eyes aglow, took her chin in his\nhand, and set her shuddering by his brutal kiss.\n\n\"It's an earnest,\" he said, smiling grimly. \"Let that quiet you, little\nrebel, till I've done with these rogues.\"\n\nAnd he swung away again, leaving her faint and trembling in the arms of\nher anguished mother. His men stood, grinning, awaiting orders, the two\nprisoners now fast pinioned.\n\n\"Take them away. Let Cornet Drake have charge of them.\" His smouldering\neye again sought the cowering girl. \"I'll stay awhile--to search out\nthis place. There may be other rebels hidden here.\" As an afterthought,\nhe added: \"And take this fellow with you.\" He pointed to Mr. Blood.\n\"Bestir!\"\n\nMr. Blood started out of his musings. He had been considering that in\nhis case of instruments there was a lancet with which he might perform\non Captain Hobart a beneficial operation. Beneficial, that is, to\nhumanity. In any case, the dragoon was obviously plethoric and would\nbe the better for a blood-letting. The difficulty lay in making the\nopportunity. He was beginning to wonder if he could lure the Captain\naside with some tale of hidden treasure, when this untimely interruption\nset a term to that interesting speculation.\n\nHe sought to temporize.\n\n\"Faith it will suit me very well,\" said he. \"For Bridgewater is my\ndestination, and but that ye detained me I'd have been on my way thither\nnow.\"\n\n\"Your destination there will be the gaol.\"\n\n\"Ah, bah! Ye're surely joking!\"\n\n\"There's a gallows for you if you prefer it. It's merely a question of\nnow or later.\"\n\nRude hands seized Mr. Blood, and that precious lancet was in the case on\nthe table out of reach. He twisted out of the grip of the dragoons, for\nhe was strong and agile, but they closed with him again immediately, and\nbore him down. Pinning him to the ground, they tied his wrists behind\nhis back, then roughly pulled him to his feet again.\n\n\"Take him away,\" said Hobart shortly, and turned to issue his orders to\nthe other waiting troopers. \"Go search the house, from attic to cellar;\nthen report to me here.\"\n\nThe soldiers trailed out by the door leading to the interior. Mr. Blood\nwas thrust by his guards into the courtyard, where Pitt and Baynes\nalready waited. From the threshold of the hall, he looked back at\nCaptain Hobart, and his sapphire eyes were blazing. On his lips trembled\na threat of what he would do to Hobart if he should happen to survive\nthis business. Betimes he remembered that to utter it were probably to\nextinguish his chance of living to execute it. For to-day the King's men\nwere masters in the West, and the West was regarded as enemy country, to\nbe subjected to the worst horror of war by the victorious side. Here a\ncaptain of horse was for the moment lord of life and death.\n\nUnder the apple-trees in the orchard Mr. Blood and his companions in\nmisfortune were made fast each to a trooper's stirrup leather. Then at\nthe sharp order of the cornet, the little troop started for Bridgewater.\nAs they set out there was the fullest confirmation of Mr. Blood's\nhideous assumption that to the dragoons this was a conquered enemy\ncountry. There were sounds of rending timbers, of furniture smashed and\noverthrown, the shouts and laughter of brutal men, to announce that this\nhunt for rebels was no more than a pretext for pillage and destruction.\nFinally above all other sounds came the piercing screams of a woman in\nacutest agony.\n\nBaynes checked in his stride, and swung round writhing, his face ashen.\nAs a consequence he was jerked from his feet by the rope that attached\nhim to the stirrup leather, and he was dragged helplessly a yard or two\nbefore the trooper reined in, cursing him foully, and striking him with\nthe flat of his sword.\n\nIt came to Mr. Blood, as he trudged forward under the laden apple-trees\non that fragrant, delicious July morning, that man--as he had long\nsuspected--was the vilest work of God, and that only a fool would set\nhimself up as a healer of a species that was best exterminated.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE\n\n\nIt was not until two months later--on the 19th of September, if you\nmust have the actual date--that Peter Blood was brought to trial, upon\na charge of high treason. We know that he was not guilty of this; but\nwe need not doubt that he was quite capable of it by the time he was\nindicted. Those two months of inhuman, unspeakable imprisonment had\nmoved his mind to a cold and deadly hatred of King James and his\nrepresentatives. It says something for his fortitude that in all the\ncircumstances he should still have had a mind at all. Yet, terrible\nas was the position of this entirely innocent man, he had cause for\nthankfulness on two counts. The first of these was that he should have\nbeen brought to trial at all; the second, that his trial took place\non the date named, and not a day earlier. In the very delay which\nexacerbated him lay--although he did not realize it--his only chance of\navoiding the gallows.\n\nEasily, but for the favour of Fortune, he might have been one of those\nhaled, on the morrow of the battle, more or less haphazard from\nthe overflowing gaol at Bridgewater to be summarily hanged in the\nmarket-place by the bloodthirsty Colonel Kirke. There was about the\nColonel of the Tangiers Regiment a deadly despatch which might have\ndisposed in like fashion of all those prisoners, numerous as they were,\nbut for the vigorous intervention of Bishop Mews, which put an end to\nthe drumhead courts-martial.\n\nEven so, in that first week after Sedgemoor, Kirke and Feversham\ncontrived between them to put to death over a hundred men after a trial\nso summary as to be no trial at all. They required human freights for\nthe gibbets with which they were planting the countryside, and they\nlittle cared how they procured them or what innocent lives they took.\nWhat, after all, was the life of a clod? The executioners were kept busy\nwith rope and chopper and cauldrons of pitch. I spare you the details of\nthat nauseating picture. It is, after all, with the fate of Peter Blood\nthat we are concerned rather than with that of the Monmouth rebels.\n\nHe survived to be included in one of those melancholy droves of\nprisoners who, chained in pairs, were marched from Bridgewater to\nTaunton. Those who were too sorely wounded to march were conveyed in\ncarts, into which they were brutally crowded, their wounds undressed and\nfestering. Many were fortunate enough to die upon the way. When Blood\ninsisted upon his right to exercise his art so as to relieve some of\nthis suffering, he was accounted importunate and threatened with a\nflogging. If he had one regret now it was that he had not been out with\nMonmouth. That, of course, was illogical; but you can hardly expect\nlogic from a man in his position.\n\nHis chain companion on that dreadful march was the same Jeremy Pitt who\nhad been the agent of his present misfortunes. The young shipmaster\nhad remained his close companion after their common arrest. Hence,\nfortuitously, had they been chained together in the crowded prison,\nwhere they were almost suffocated by the heat and the stench during\nthose days of July, August, and September.\n\nScraps of news filtered into the gaol from the outside world. Some may\nhave been deliberately allowed to penetrate. Of these was the tale of\nMonmouth's execution. It created profoundest dismay amongst those men\nwho were suffering for the Duke and for the religious cause he had\nprofessed to champion. Many refused utterly to believe it. A wild story\nbegan to circulate that a man resembling Monmouth had offered himself up\nin the Duke's stead, and that Monmouth survived to come again in glory\nto deliver Zion and make war upon Babylon.\n\nMr. Blood heard that tale with the same indifference with which he had\nreceived the news of Monmouth's death. But one shameful thing he heard\nin connection with this which left him not quite so unmoved, and served\nto nourish the contempt he was forming for King James. His Majesty had\nconsented to see Monmouth. To have done so unless he intended to pardon\nhim was a thing execrable and damnable beyond belief; for the only other\nobject in granting that interview could be the evilly mean satisfaction\nof spurning the abject penitence of his unfortunate nephew.\n\nLater they heard that Lord Grey, who after the Duke--indeed, perhaps,\nbefore him--was the main leader of the rebellion, had purchased his own\npardon for forty thousand pounds. Peter Blood found this of a piece with\nthe rest. His contempt for King James blazed out at last.\n\n\"Why, here's a filthy mean creature to sit on a throne. If I had known\nas much of him before as I know to-day, I don't doubt I should have\ngiven cause to be where I am now.\" And then on a sudden thought: \"And\nwhere will Lord Gildoy be, do you suppose?\" he asked.\n\nYoung Pitt, whom he addressed, turned towards him a face from which the\nruddy tan of the sea had faded almost completely during those months of\ncaptivity. His grey eyes were round and questioning. Blood answered him.\n\n\"Sure, now, we've never seen his lordship since that day at\nOglethorpe's. And where are the other gentry that were taken?--the real\nleaders of this plaguey rebellion. Grey's case explains their absence,\nI think. They are wealthy men that can ransom themselves. Here awaiting\nthe gallows are none but the unfortunates who followed; those who had\nthe honour to lead them go free. It's a curious and instructive reversal\nof the usual way of these things. Faith, it's an uncertain world\nentirely!\"\n\nHe laughed, and settled down into that spirit of scorn, wrapped in\nwhich he stepped later into the great hall of Taunton Castle to take his\ntrial. With him went Pitt and the yeoman Baynes. The three of them were\nto be tried together, and their case was to open the proceedings of that\nghastly day.\n\nThe hall, even to the galleries--thronged with spectators, most of whom\nwere ladies--was hung in scarlet; a pleasant conceit, this, of the Lord\nChief Justice's, who naturally enough preferred the colour that should\nreflect his own bloody mind.\n\nAt the upper end, on a raised dais, sat the Lords Commissioners, the\nfive judges in their scarlet robes and heavy dark periwigs, Baron\nJeffreys of Wem enthroned in the middle place.\n\nThe prisoners filed in under guard. The crier called for silence under\npain of imprisonment, and as the hum of voices gradually became hushed,\nMr. Blood considered with interest the twelve good men and true that\ncomposed the jury. Neither good nor true did they look. They were\nscared, uneasy, and hangdog as any set of thieves caught with their\nhands in the pockets of their neighbours. They were twelve shaken men,\neach of whom stood between the sword of the Lord Chief Justice's recent\nbloodthirsty charge and the wall of his own conscience.\n\nFrom them Mr. Blood's calm, deliberate glance passed on to consider the\nLords Commissioners, and particularly the presiding Judge, that Lord\nJeffreys, whose terrible fame had come ahead of him from Dorchester.\n\nHe beheld a tall, slight man on the young side of forty, with an oval\nface that was delicately beautiful. There were dark stains of suffering\nor sleeplessness under the low-lidded eyes, heightening their brilliance\nand their gentle melancholy. The face was very pale, save for the vivid\ncolour of the full lips and the hectic flush on the rather high but\ninconspicuous cheek-bones. It was something in those lips that marred\nthe perfection of that countenance; a fault, elusive but undeniable,\nlurked there to belie the fine sensitiveness of those nostrils, the\ntenderness of those dark, liquid eyes and the noble calm of that pale\nbrow.\n\nThe physician in Mr. Blood regarded the man with peculiar interest\nknowing as he did the agonizing malady from which his lordship suffered,\nand the amazingly irregular, debauched life that he led in spite of\nit--perhaps because of it.\n\n\"Peter Blood, hold up your hand!\"\n\nAbruptly he was recalled to his position by the harsh voice of the clerk\nof arraigns. His obedience was mechanical, and the clerk droned out the\nwordy indictment which pronounced Peter Blood a false traitor against\nthe Most Illustrious and Most Excellent Prince, James the Second, by\nthe grace of God, of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland King, his\nsupreme and natural lord. It informed him that, having no fear of God in\nhis heart, but being moved and seduced by the instigation of the Devil,\nhe had failed in the love and true and due natural obedience towards his\nsaid lord the King, and had moved to disturb the peace and tranquillity\nof the kingdom and to stir up war and rebellion to depose his said lord\nthe King from the title, honour, and the regal name of the imperial\ncrown--and much more of the same kind, at the end of all of which he\nwas invited to say whether he was guilty or not guilty. He answered more\nthan was asked.\n\n\"It's entirely innocent I am.\"\n\nA small, sharp-faced man at a table before and to the right of him\nbounced up. It was Mr. Pollexfen, the Judge-Advocate.\n\n\"Are you guilty or not guilty?\" snapped this peppery gentleman. \"You\nmust take the words.\"\n\n\"Words, is it?\" said Peter Blood. \"Oh--not guilty.\" And he went on,\naddressing himself to the bench. \"On this same subject of words, may it\nplease your lordships, I am guilty of nothing to justify any of those\nwords I have heard used to describe me, unless it be of a want of\npatience at having been closely confined for two months and longer in a\nfoetid gaol with great peril to my health and even life.\"\n\nBeing started, he would have added a deal more; but at this point the\nLord Chief Justice interposed in a gentle, rather plaintive voice.\n\n\"Look you, sir: because we must observe the common and usual methods of\ntrial, I must interrupt you now. You are no doubt ignorant of the forms\nof law?\"\n\n\"Not only ignorant, my lord, but hitherto most happy in that ignorance.\nI could gladly have forgone this acquaintance with them.\"\n\nA pale smile momentarily lightened the wistful countenance.\n\n\"I believe you. You shall be fully heard when you come to your defence.\nBut anything you say now is altogether irregular and improper.\"\n\nEnheartened by that apparent sympathy and consideration, Mr. Blood\nanswered thereafter, as was required of him, that he would be tried by\nGod and his country. Whereupon, having prayed to God to send him a good\ndeliverance, the clerk called upon Andrew Baynes to hold up his hand and\nplead.\n\nFrom Baynes, who pleaded not guilty, the clerk passed on to Pitt, who\nboldly owned his guilt. The Lord Chief Justice stirred at that.\n\n\"Come; that's better,\" quoth he, and his four scarlet brethren nodded.\n\"If all were as obstinate as his two fellow-rebels, there would never be\nan end.\"\n\nAfter that ominous interpolation, delivered with an inhuman iciness that\nsent a shiver through the court, Mr. Pollexfen got to his feet. With\ngreat prolixity he stated the general case against the three men, and\nthe particular case against Peter Blood, whose indictment was to be\ntaken first.\n\nThe only witness called for the King was Captain Hobart. He testified\nbriskly to the manner in which he had found and taken the three\nprisoners, together with Lord Gildoy. Upon the orders of his colonel he\nwould have hanged Pitt out of hand, but was restrained by the lies of\nthe prisoner Blood, who led him to believe that Pitt was a peer of the\nrealm and a person of consideration.\n\nAs the Captain's evidence concluded, Lord Jeffreys looked across at\nPeter Blood.\n\n\"Will the prisoner Blood ask the witness any questions?\"\n\n\"None, my lord. He has correctly related what occurred.\"\n\n\"I am glad to have your admission of that without any of the\nprevarications that are usual in your kind. And I will say this, that\nhere prevarication would avail you little. For we always have the truth\nin the end. Be sure of that.\"\n\nBaynes and Pitt similarly admitted the accuracy of the Captain's\nevidence, whereupon the scarlet figure of the Lord Chief Justice heaved\na sigh of relief.\n\n\"This being so, let us get on, in God's name; for we have much to do.\"\nThere was now no trace of gentleness in his voice. It was brisk and\nrasping, and the lips through which it passed were curved in scorn. \"I\ntake it, Mr. Pollexfen, that the wicked treason of these three rogues\nbeing established--indeed, admitted by them--there is no more to be\nsaid.\"\n\nPeter Blood's voice rang out crisply, on a note that almost seemed to\ncontain laughter.\n\n\"May it please your lordship, but there's a deal more to be said.\"\n\nHis lordship looked at him, first in blank amazement at his audacity,\nthen gradually with an expression of dull anger. The scarlet lips fell\ninto unpleasant, cruel lines that transfigured the whole countenance.\n\n\"How now, rogue? Would you waste our time with idle subterfuge?\"\n\n\"I would have your lordship and the gentlemen of the jury hear me on my\ndefence, as your lordship promised that I should be heard.\"\n\n\"Why, so you shall, villain; so you shall.\" His lordship's voice was\nharsh as a file. He writhed as he spoke, and for an instant his features\nwere distorted. A delicate dead-white hand, on which the veins showed\nblue, brought forth a handkerchief with which he dabbed his lips and\nthen his brow. Observing him with his physician's eye, Peter Blood\njudged him a prey to the pain of the disease that was destroying him.\n\"So you shall. But after the admission made, what defence remains?\"\n\n\"You shall judge, my lord.\"\n\n\"That is the purpose for which I sit here.\"\n\n\"And so shall you, gentlemen.\" Blood looked from judge to jury. The\nlatter shifted uncomfortably under the confident flash of his blue eyes.\nLord Jeffreys's bullying charge had whipped the spirit out of them. Had\nthey, themselves, been prisoners accused of treason, he could not have\narraigned them more ferociously.\n\nPeter Blood stood boldly forward, erect, self-possessed, and saturnine.\nHe was freshly shaven, and his periwig, if out of curl, was at least\ncarefully combed and dressed.\n\n\"Captain Hobart has testified to what he knows--that he found me at\nOglethorpe's Farm on the Monday morning after the battle at Weston. But\nhe has not told you what I did there.\"\n\nAgain the Judge broke in. \"Why, what should you have been doing there\nin the company of rebels, two of whom--Lord Gildoy and your fellow\nthere--have already admitted their guilt?\"\n\n\"That is what I beg leave to tell your lordship.\"\n\n\"I pray you do, and in God's name be brief, man. For if I am to be\ntroubled with the say of all you traitor dogs, I may sit here until the\nSpring Assizes.\"\n\n\"I was there, my lord, in my quality as a physician, to dress Lord\nGildoy's wounds.\"\n\n\"What's this? Do you tell us that you are a physician?\"\n\n\"A graduate of Trinity College, Dublin.\"\n\n\"Good God!\" cried Lord Jeffreys, his voice suddenly swelling, his eyes\nupon the jury. \"What an impudent rogue is this! You heard the witness\nsay that he had known him in Tangiers some years ago, and that he was\nthen an officer in the French service. You heard the prisoner admit that\nthe witness had spoken the truth?\"\n\n\"Why, so he had. Yet what I am telling you is also true, so it is. For\nsome years I was a soldier; but before that I was a physician, and I\nhave been one again since January last, established in Bridgewater, as I\ncan bring a hundred witnesses to prove.\"\n\n\"There's not the need to waste our time with that. I will convict you\nout of your own rascally mouth. I will ask you only this: How came you,\nwho represent yourself as a physician peacefully following your\ncalling in the town of Bridgewater, to be with the army of the Duke of\nMonmouth?\"\n\n\"I was never with that army. No witness has sworn to that, and I dare\nswear that no witness will. I never was attracted to the late rebellion.\nI regarded the adventure as a wicked madness. I take leave to ask your\nlordship\" (his brogue became more marked than ever) \"what should I,\nwho was born and bred a papist, be doing in the army of the Protestant\nChampion?\"\n\n\"A papist thou?\" The judge gloomed on him a moment. \"Art more like\na snivelling, canting Jack Presbyter. I tell you, man, I can smell a\nPresbyterian forty miles.\"\n\n\"Then I'll take leave to marvel that with so keen a nose your lordship\ncan't smell a papist at four paces.\"\n\nThere was a ripple of laughter in the galleries, instantly quelled by\nthe fierce glare of the Judge and the voice of the crier.\n\nLord Jeffreys leaned farther forward upon his desk. He raised that\ndelicate white hand, still clutching its handkerchief, and sprouting\nfrom a froth of lace.\n\n\"We'll leave your religion out of account for the moment, friend,\" said\nhe. \"But mark what I say to you.\" With a minatory forefinger he beat the\ntime of his words. \"Know, friend, that there is no religion a man\ncan pretend to can give a countenance to lying. Thou hast a precious\nimmortal soul, and there is nothing in the world equal to it in value.\nConsider that the great God of Heaven and Earth, before Whose tribunal\nthou and we and all persons are to stand at the last day, will take\nvengeance on thee for every falsehood, and justly strike thee into\neternal flames, make thee drop into the bottomless pit of fire and\nbrimstone, if thou offer to deviate the least from the truth and nothing\nbut the truth. For I tell thee God is not mocked. On that I charge you\nto answer truthfully. How came you to be taken with these rebels?\"\n\nPeter Blood gaped at him a moment in consternation. The man was\nincredible, unreal, fantastic, a nightmare judge. Then he collected\nhimself to answer.\n\n\"I was summoned that morning to succour Lord Gildoy, and I conceived it\nto be the duty imposed upon me by my calling to answer that summons.\"\n\n\"Did you so?\" The Judge, terrible now of aspect--his face white, his\ntwisted lips red as the blood for which they thirsted--glared upon\nhim in evil mockery. Then he controlled himself as if by an effort.\nHe sighed. He resumed his earlier gentle plaintiveness. \"Lord! How you\nwaste our time. But I'll have patience with you. Who summoned you?\"\n\n\"Master Pitt there, as he will testify.\"\n\n\"Oh! Master Pitt will testify--he that is himself a traitor\nself-confessed. Is that your witness?\"\n\n\"There is also Master Baynes here, who can answer to it.\"\n\n\"Good Master Baynes will have to answer for himself; and I doubt not\nhe'll be greatly exercised to save his own neck from a halter. Come,\ncome, sir; are these your only witnesses?\"\n\n\"I could bring others from Bridgewater, who saw me set out that morning\nupon the crupper of Master Pitt's horse.\"\n\nHis lordship smiled. \"It will not be necessary. For, mark me, I do not\nintend to waste more time on you. Answer me only this: When Master Pitt,\nas you pretend, came to summon you, did you know that he had been, as\nyou have heard him confess, of Monmouth's following?\"\n\n\"I did, My lord.\"\n\n\"You did! Ha!\" His lordship looked at the cringing jury and uttered a\nshort, stabbing laugh. \"Yet in spite of that you went with him?\"\n\n\"To succour a wounded man, as was my sacred duty.\"\n\n\"Thy sacred duty, sayest thou?\" Fury blazed out of him again. \"Good God!\nWhat a generation of vipers do we live in! Thy sacred duty, rogue, is to\nthy King and to God. But let it pass. Did he tell you whom it was that\nyou were desired to succour?\"\n\n\"Lord Gildoy--yes.\"\n\n\"And you knew that Lord Gildoy had been wounded in the battle, and on\nwhat side he fought?\"\n\n\"I knew.\"\n\n\"And yet, being, as you would have us believe, a true and loyal subject\nof our Lord the King, you went to succour him?\"\n\nPeter Blood lost patience for a moment. \"My business, my lord, was with\nhis wounds, not with his politics.\"\n\nA murmur from the galleries and even from the jury approved him. It\nserved only to drive his terrible judge into a deeper fury.\n\n\"Jesus God! Was there ever such an impudent villain in the world as\nthou?\" He swung, white-faced, to the jury. \"I hope, gentlemen of the\njury, you take notice of the horrible carriage of this traitor rogue,\nand withal you cannot but observe the spirit of this sort of people,\nwhat a villainous and devilish one it is. Out of his own mouth he has\nsaid enough to hang him a dozen times. Yet is there more. Answer me\nthis, sir: When you cozened Captain Hobart with your lies concerning the\nstation of this other traitor Pitt, what was your business then?\"\n\n\"To save him from being hanged without trial, as was threatened.\"\n\n\"What concern was it of yours whether or how the wretch was hanged?\"\n\n\"Justice is the concern of every loyal subject, for an injustice\ncommitted by one who holds the King's commission is in some sense a\ndishonour to the King's majesty.\"\n\nIt was a shrewd, sharp thrust aimed at the jury, and it reveals,\nI think, the alertness of the man's mind, his self-possession ever\nsteadiest in moments of dire peril. With any other jury it must have\nmade the impression that he hoped to make. It may even have made its\nimpression upon these poor pusillanimous sheep. But the dread judge was\nthere to efface it.\n\nHe gasped aloud, then flung himself violently forward.\n\n\"Lord of Heaven!\" he stormed. \"Was there ever such a canting, impudent\nrascal? But I have done with you. I see thee, villain, I see thee\nalready with a halter round thy neck.\"\n\nHaving spoken so, gloatingly, evilly, he sank back again, and composed\nhimself. It was as if a curtain fell. All emotion passed again from his\npale face. Back to invest it again came that gentle melancholy. Speaking\nafter a moment's pause, his voice was soft, almost tender, yet every\nword of it carried sharply through that hushed court.\n\n\"If I know my own heart it is not in my nature to desire the hurt of\nanybody, much less to delight in his eternal perdition. It is out of\ncompassion for you that I have used all these words--because I would\nhave you have some regard for your immortal soul, and not ensure its\ndamnation by obdurately persisting in falsehood and prevarication. But I\nsee that all the pains in the world, and all compassion and charity are\nlost upon you, and therefore I will say no more to you.\" He turned again\nto the jury that countenance of wistful beauty. \"Gentlemen, I must tell\nyou for law, of which we are the judges, and not you, that if any person\nbe in actual rebellion against the King, and another person--who really\nand actually was not in rebellion--does knowingly receive, harbour,\ncomfort, or succour him, such a person is as much a traitor as he who\nindeed bore arms. We are bound by our oaths and consciences to declare\nto you what is law; and you are bound by your oaths and your consciences\nto deliver and to declare to us by your verdict the truth of the facts.\"\n\nUpon that he proceeded to his summing-up, showing how Baynes and Blood\nwere both guilty of treason, the first for having harboured a traitor,\nthe second for having succoured that traitor by dressing his wounds. He\ninterlarded his address by sycophantic allusions to his natural lord\nand lawful sovereign, the King, whom God had set over them, and with\nvituperations of Nonconformity and of Monmouth, of whom--in his own\nwords--he dared boldly affirm that the meanest subject within the\nkingdom that was of legitimate birth had a better title to the crown.\n\"Jesus God! That ever we should have such a generation of vipers among\nus,\" he burst out in rhetorical frenzy. And then he sank back as if\nexhausted by the violence he had used. A moment he was still, dabbing\nhis lips again; then he moved uneasily; once more his features were\ntwisted by pain, and in a few snarling, almost incoherent words he\ndismissed the jury to consider the verdict.\n\nPeter Blood had listened to the intemperate, the blasphemous, and almost\nobscene invective of that tirade with a detachment that afterwards, in\nretrospect, surprised him. He was so amazed by the man, by the reactions\ntaking place in him between mind and body, and by his methods of\nbullying and coercing the jury into bloodshed, that he almost forgot\nthat his own life was at stake.\n\nThe absence of that dazed jury was a brief one. The verdict found the\nthree prisoners guilty. Peter Blood looked round the scarlet-hung court.\nFor an instant that foam of white faces seemed to heave before him. Then\nhe was himself again, and a voice was asking him what he had to say\nfor himself, why sentence of death should not be passed upon him, being\nconvicted of high treason.\n\nHe laughed, and his laugh jarred uncannily upon the deathly stillness\nof the court. It was all so grotesque, such a mockery of justice\nadministered by that wistful-eyed jack-pudding in scarlet, who was\nhimself a mockery--the venal instrument of a brutally spiteful and\nvindictive king. His laughter shocked the austerity of that same\njack-pudding.\n\n\"Do you laugh, sirrah, with the rope about your neck, upon the very\nthreshold of that eternity you are so suddenly to enter into?\"\n\nAnd then Blood took his revenge.\n\n\"Faith, it's in better case I am for mirth than your lordship. For I\nhave this to say before you deliver judgment. Your lordship sees me--an\ninnocent man whose only offence is that I practised charity--with a\nhalter round my neck. Your lordship, being the justiciar, speaks with\nknowledge of what is to come to me. I, being a physician, may speak with\nknowledge of what is to come to your lordship. And I tell you that I\nwould not now change places with you--that I would not exchange this\nhalter that you fling about my neck for the stone that you carry in\nyour body. The death to which you may doom me is a light pleasantry by\ncontrast with the death to which your lordship has been doomed by that\nGreat Judge with whose name your lordship makes so free.\"\n\nThe Lord Chief Justice sat stiffly upright, his face ashen, his lips\ntwitching, and whilst you might have counted ten there was no sound in\nthat paralyzed court after Peter Blood had finished speaking. All those\nwho knew Lord Jeffreys regarded this as the lull before the storm, and\nbraced themselves for the explosion. But none came.\n\nSlowly, faintly, the colour crept back into that ashen face. The scarlet\nfigure lost its rigidity, and bent forward. His lordship began to speak.\nIn a muted voice and briefly--much more briefly than his wont on such\noccasions and in a manner entirely mechanical, the manner of a man\nwhose thoughts are elsewhere while his lips are speaking--he delivered\nsentence of death in the prescribed form, and without the least\nallusion to what Peter Blood had said. Having delivered it, he sank back\nexhausted, his eyes half-closed, his brow agleam with sweat.\n\nThe prisoners filed out.\n\nMr. Pollexfen--a Whig at heart despite the position of Judge-Advocate\nwhich he occupied--was overheard by one of the jurors to mutter in the\near of a brother counsel:\n\n\"On my soul, that swarthy rascal has given his lordship a scare. It's a\npity he must hang. For a man who can frighten Jeffreys should go far.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. HUMAN MERCHANDISE\n\n\nMr. Pollexfen was at one and the same time right and wrong--a condition\nmuch more common than is generally supposed.\n\nHe was right in his indifferently expressed thought that a man whose\nmien and words could daunt such a lord of terror as Jeffreys, should by\nthe dominance of his nature be able to fashion himself a considerable\ndestiny. He was wrong--though justifiably so--in his assumption that\nPeter Blood must hang.\n\nI have said that the tribulations with which he was visited as a result\nof his errand of mercy to Oglethorpe's Farm contained--although as yet\nhe did not perceive it, perhaps--two sources of thankfulness: one that\nhe was tried at all; the other that his trial took place on the 19th\nof September. Until the 18th, the sentences passed by the court of the\nLords Commissioners had been carried out literally and expeditiously.\nBut on the morning of the 19th there arrived at Taunton a courier from\nLord Sunderland, the Secretary of State, with a letter for Lord Jeffreys\nwherein he was informed that His Majesty had been graciously pleased\nto command that eleven hundred rebels should be furnished for\ntransportation to some of His Majesty's southern plantations, Jamaica,\nBarbados, or any of the Leeward Islands.\n\nYou are not to suppose that this command was dictated by any sense of\nmercy. Lord Churchill was no more than just when he spoke of the King's\nheart as being as insensible as marble. It had been realized that in\nthese wholesale hangings there was taking place a reckless waste of\nvaluable material. Slaves were urgently required in the plantations,\nand a healthy, vigorous man could be reckoned worth at least from ten\nto fifteen pounds. Then, there were at court many gentlemen who had some\nclaim or other upon His Majesty's bounty. Here was a cheap and ready way\nto discharge these claims. From amongst the convicted rebels a certain\nnumber might be set aside to be bestowed upon those gentlemen, so that\nthey might dispose of them to their own profit.\n\nMy Lord Sunderland's letter gives precise details of the royal\nmunificence in human flesh. A thousand prisoners were to be distributed\namong some eight courtiers and others, whilst a postscriptum to his\nlordship's letter asked for a further hundred to be held at the disposal\nof the Queen. These prisoners were to be transported at once to His\nMajesty's southern plantations, and to be kept there for the space of\nten years before being restored to liberty, the parties to whom they\nwere assigned entering into security to see that transportation was\nimmediately effected.\n\nWe know from Lord Jeffreys's secretary how the Chief Justice inveighed\nthat night in drunken frenzy against this misplaced clemency to which\nHis Majesty had been persuaded. We know how he attempted by letter to\ninduce the King to reconsider his decision. But James adhered to it. It\nwas--apart from the indirect profit he derived from it--a clemency\nfull worthy of him. He knew that to spare lives in this fashion was to\nconvert them into living deaths. Many must succumb in torment to the\nhorrors of West Indian slavery, and so be the envy of their surviving\ncompanions.\n\nThus it happened that Peter Blood, and with him Jeremy Pitt and Andrew\nBaynes, instead of being hanged, drawn, and quartered as their sentences\ndirected, were conveyed to Bristol and there shipped with some fifty\nothers aboard the Jamaica Merchant. From close confinement under\nhatches, ill-nourishment and foul water, a sickness broke out amongst\nthem, of which eleven died. Amongst these was the unfortunate yeoman\nfrom Oglethorpe's Farm, brutally torn from his quiet homestead amid\nthe fragrant cider orchards for no other sin but that he had practised\nmercy.\n\nThe mortality might have been higher than it was but for Peter Blood.\nAt first the master of the Jamaica Merchant had answered with oaths and\nthreats the doctor's expostulations against permitting men to perish\nin this fashion, and his insistence that he should be made free of the\nmedicine chest and given leave to minister to the sick. But presently\nCaptain Gardner came to see that he might be brought to task for\nthese too heavy losses of human merchandise and because of this he was\nbelatedly glad to avail himself of the skill of Peter Blood. The doctor\nwent to work zealously and zestfully, and wrought so ably that, by his\nministrations and by improving the condition of his fellow-captives, he\nchecked the spread of the disease.\n\nTowards the middle of December the Jamaica Merchant dropped anchor in\nCarlisle Bay, and put ashore the forty-two surviving rebels-convict.\n\nIf these unfortunates had imagined--as many of them appear to have\ndone--that they were coming into some wild, savage country, the\nprospect, of which they had a glimpse before they were hustled over\nthe ship's side into the waiting boats, was enough to correct the\nimpression. They beheld a town of sufficiently imposing proportions\ncomposed of houses built upon European notions of architecture, but\nwithout any of the huddle usual in European cities. The spire of a\nchurch rose dominantly above the red roofs, a fort guarded the entrance\nof the wide harbour, with guns thrusting their muzzles between the\ncrenels, and the wide facade of Government House revealed itself\ndominantly placed on a gentle hill above the town. This hill was vividly\ngreen as is an English hill in April, and the day was such a day as\nApril gives to England, the season of heavy rains being newly ended.\n\nOn a wide cobbled space on the sea front they found a guard of\nred-coated militia drawn up to receive them, and a crowd--attracted by\ntheir arrival--which in dress and manner differed little from a crowd in\na seaport at home save that it contained fewer women and a great number\nof negroes.\n\nTo inspect them, drawn up there on the mole, came Governor Steed,\na short, stout, red-faced gentleman, in blue taffetas burdened by a\nprodigious amount of gold lace, who limped a little and leaned heavily\nupon a stout ebony cane. After him, in the uniform of a colonel of the\nBarbados Militia, rolled a tall, corpulent man who towered head and\nshoulders above the Governor, with malevolence plainly written on his\nenormous yellowish countenance. At his side, and contrasting oddly with\nhis grossness, moving with an easy stripling grace, came a slight young\nlady in a modish riding-gown. The broad brim of a grey hat with scarlet\nsweep of ostrich plume shaded an oval face upon which the climate of\nthe Tropic of Cancer had made no impression, so delicately fair was its\ncomplexion. Ringlets of red-brown hair hung to her shoulders. Frankness\nlooked out from her hazel eyes which were set wide; commiseration\nrepressed now the mischievousness that normally inhabited her fresh\nyoung mouth.\n\nPeter Blood caught himself staring in a sort of amazement at that\npiquant face, which seemed here so out of place, and finding his stare\nreturned, he shifted uncomfortably. He grew conscious of the sorry\nfigure that he cut. Unwashed, with rank and matted hair and a\ndisfiguring black beard upon his face, and the erstwhile splendid suit\nof black camlet in which he had been taken prisoner now reduced to rags\nthat would have disgraced a scarecrow, he was in no case for inspection\nby such dainty eyes as these. Nevertheless, they continued to inspect\nhim with round-eyed, almost childlike wonder and pity. Their owner put\nforth a hand to touch the scarlet sleeve of her companion, whereupon\nwith an ill-tempered grunt the man swung his great bulk round so that he\ndirectly confronted her.\n\nLooking up into his face, she was speaking to him earnestly, but the\nColonel plainly gave her no more than the half of his attention. His\nlittle beady eyes, closely flanking a fleshly, pendulous nose, had\npassed from her and were fixed upon fair-haired, sturdy young Pitt, who\nwas standing beside Blood.\n\nThe Governor had also come to a halt, and for a moment now that little\ngroup of three stood in conversation. What the lady said, Peter could\nnot hear at all, for she lowered her voice; the Colonel's reached him\nin a confused rumble, but the Governor was neither considerate nor\nindistinct; he had a high-pitched voice which carried far, and believing\nhimself witty, he desired to be heard by all.\n\n\"But, my dear Colonel Bishop, it is for you to take first choice from\nthis dainty nosegay, and at your own price. After that we'll send the\nrest to auction.\"\n\nColonel Bishop nodded his acknowledgment. He raised his voice in\nanswering. \"Your excellency is very good. But, faith, they're a weedy\nlot, not likely to be of much value in the plantation.\" His beady eyes\nscanned them again, and his contempt of them deepened the malevolence of\nhis face. It was as if he were annoyed with them for being in no better\ncondition. Then he beckoned forward Captain Gardner, the master of the\nJamaica Merchant, and for some minutes stood in talk with him over a\nlist which the latter produced at his request.\n\nPresently he waved aside the list and advanced alone towards the\nrebels-convict, his eyes considering them, his lips pursed. Before the\nyoung Somersetshire shipmaster he came to a halt, and stood an instant\npondering him. Then he fingered the muscles of the young man's arm,\nand bade him open his mouth that he might see his teeth. He pursed his\ncoarse lips again and nodded.\n\nHe spoke to Gardner over his shoulder.\n\n\"Fifteen pounds for this one.\"\n\nThe Captain made a face of dismay. \"Fifteen pounds! It isn't half what I\nmeant to ask for him.\"\n\n\"It is double what I had meant to give,\" grunted the Colonel.\n\n\"But he would be cheap at thirty pounds, your honour.\"\n\n\"I can get a negro for that. These white swine don't live. They're not\nfit for the labour.\"\n\nGardner broke into protestations of Pitt's health, youth, and vigour.\nIt was not a man he was discussing; it was a beast of burden. Pitt, a\nsensitive lad, stood mute and unmoving. Only the ebb and flow of colour\nin his cheeks showed the inward struggle by which he maintained his\nself-control.\n\nPeter Blood was nauseated by the loathsome haggle.\n\nIn the background, moving slowly away down the line of prisoners, went\nthe lady in conversation with the Governor, who smirked and preened\nhimself as he limped beside her. She was unconscious of the loathly\nbusiness the Colonel was transacting. Was she, wondered Blood,\nindifferent to it?\n\nColonel Bishop swung on his heel to pass on.\n\n\"I'll go as far as twenty pounds. Not a penny more, and it's twice as\nmuch as you are like to get from Crabston.\"\n\nCaptain Gardner, recognizing the finality of the tone, sighed and\nyielded. Already Bishop was moving down the line. For Mr. Blood, as\nfor a weedy youth on his left, the Colonel had no more than a glance of\ncontempt. But the next man, a middle-aged Colossus named Wolverstone,\nwho had lost an eye at Sedgemoor, drew his regard, and the haggling was\nrecommenced.\n\nPeter Blood stood there in the brilliant sunshine and inhaled the\nfragrant air, which was unlike any air that he had ever breathed. It\nwas laden with a strange perfume, blend of logwood flower, pimento, and\naromatic cedars. He lost himself in unprofitable speculations born of\nthat singular fragrance. He was in no mood for conversation, nor was\nPitt, who stood dumbly at his side, and who was afflicted mainly at the\nmoment by the thought that he was at last about to be separated from\nthis man with whom he had stood shoulder to shoulder throughout all\nthese troublous months, and whom he had come to love and depend upon for\nguidance and sustenance. A sense of loneliness and misery pervaded him\nby contrast with which all that he had endured seemed as nothing. To\nPitt, this separation was the poignant climax of all his sufferings.\n\nOther buyers came and stared at them, and passed on. Blood did not heed\nthem. And then at the end of the line there was a movement. Gardner was\nspeaking in a loud voice, making an announcement to the general public\nof buyers that had waited until Colonel Bishop had taken his choice of\nthat human merchandise. As he finished, Blood, looking in his direction,\nnoticed that the girl was speaking to Bishop, and pointing up the line\nwith a silver-hilted riding-whip she carried. Bishop shaded his eyes\nwith his hand to look in the direction in which she was pointing.\nThen slowly, with his ponderous, rolling gait, he approached again\naccompanied by Gardner, and followed by the lady and the Governor.\n\nOn they came until the Colonel was abreast of Blood. He would have\npassed on, but that the lady tapped his arm with her whip.\n\n\"But this is the man I meant,\" she said.\n\n\"This one?\" Contempt rang in the voice. Peter Blood found himself\nstaring into a pair of beady brown eyes sunk into a yellow, fleshly face\nlike currants into a dumpling. He felt the colour creeping into his face\nunder the insult of that contemptuous inspection. \"Bah! A bag of bones.\nWhat should I do with him?\"\n\nHe was turning away when Gardner interposed.\n\n\"He maybe lean, but he's tough; tough and healthy. When half of them was\nsick and the other half sickening, this rogue kept his legs and doctored\nhis fellows. But for him there'd ha' been more deaths than there was.\nSay fifteen pounds for him, Colonel. That's cheap enough. He's tough, I\ntell your honour--tough and strong, though he be lean. And he's just the\nman to bear the heat when it comes. The climate'll never kill him.\"\n\nThere came a chuckle from Governor Steed. \"You hear, Colonel. Trust\nyour niece. Her sex knows a man when it sees one.\" And he laughed, well\npleased with his wit.\n\nBut he laughed alone. A cloud of annoyance swept across the face of\nthe Colonel's niece, whilst the Colonel himself was too absorbed in the\nconsideration of this bargain to heed the Governor's humour. He twisted\nhis lip a little, stroking his chin with his hand the while. Jeremy Pitt\nhad almost ceased to breathe.\n\n\"I'll give you ten pounds for him,\" said the Colonel at last.\n\nPeter Blood prayed that the offer might be rejected. For no reason that\nhe could have given you, he was taken with repugnance at the thought\nof becoming the property of this gross animal, and in some sort the\nproperty of that hazel-eyed young girl. But it would need more than\nrepugnance to save him from his destiny. A slave is a slave, and has\nno power to shape his fate. Peter Blood was sold to Colonel Bishop--a\ndisdainful buyer--for the ignominious sum of ten pounds.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. ARABELLA BISHOP\n\n\nOne sunny morning in January, about a month after the arrival of the\nJamaica Merchant at Bridgetown, Miss Arabella Bishop rode out from her\nuncle's fine house on the heights to the northwest of the city. She was\nattended by two negroes who trotted after her at a respectful distance,\nand her destination was Government House, whither she went to visit the\nGovernor's lady, who had lately been ailing. Reaching the summit of\na gentle, grassy slope, she met a tall, lean man dressed in a sober,\ngentlemanly fashion, who was walking in the opposite direction. He was\na stranger to her, and strangers were rare enough in the island. And yet\nin some vague way he did not seem quite a stranger.\n\nMiss Arabella drew rein, affecting to pause that she might admire the\nprospect, which was fair enough to warrant it. Yet out of the corner\nof those hazel eyes she scanned this fellow very attentively as he came\nnearer. She corrected her first impression of his dress. It was\nsober enough, but hardly gentlemanly. Coat and breeches were of plain\nhomespun; and if the former sat so well upon him it was more by virtue\nof his natural grace than by that of tailoring. His stockings were of\ncotton, harsh and plain, and the broad castor, which he respectfully\ndoffed as he came up with her, was an old one unadorned by band or\nfeather. What had seemed to be a periwig at a little distance was now\nrevealed for the man's own lustrous coiling black hair.\n\nOut of a brown, shaven, saturnine face two eyes that were startlingly\nblue considered her gravely. The man would have passed on but that she\ndetained him.\n\n\"I think I know you, sir,\" said she.\n\nHer voice was crisp and boyish, and there was something of boyishness\nin her manner--if one can apply the term to so dainty a lady. It arose\nperhaps from an ease, a directness, which disdained the artifices of her\nsex, and set her on good terms with all the world. To this it may be\ndue that Miss Arabella had reached the age of five and twenty not merely\nunmarried but unwooed. She used with all men a sisterly frankness which\nin itself contains a quality of aloofness, rendering it difficult for\nany man to become her lover.\n\nHer negroes had halted at some distance in the rear, and they squatted\nnow upon the short grass until it should be her pleasure to proceed upon\nher way.\n\nThe stranger came to a standstill upon being addressed.\n\n\"A lady should know her own property,\" said he.\n\n\"My property?\"\n\n\"Your uncle's, leastways. Let me present myself. I am called Peter\nBlood, and I am worth precisely ten pounds. I know it because that\nis the sum your uncle paid for me. It is not every man has the same\nopportunities of ascertaining his real value.\"\n\nShe recognized him then. She had not seen him since that day upon the\nmole a month ago, and that she should not instantly have known him\nagain despite the interest he had then aroused in her is not surprising,\nconsidering the change he had wrought in his appearance, which now was\nhardly that of a slave.\n\n\"My God!\" said she. \"And you can laugh!\"\n\n\"It's an achievement,\" he admitted. \"But then, I have not fared as ill\nas I might.\"\n\n\"I have heard of that,\" said she.\n\nWhat she had heard was that this rebel-convict had been discovered to\nbe a physician. The thing had come to the ears of Governor Steed, who\nsuffered damnably from the gout, and Governor Steed had borrowed the\nfellow from his purchaser. Whether by skill or good fortune, Peter Blood\nhad afforded the Governor that relief which his excellency had failed to\nobtain from the ministrations of either of the two physicians practising\nin Bridgetown. Then the Governor's lady had desired him to attend her\nfor the megrims. Mr. Blood had found her suffering from nothing worse\nthan peevishness--the result of a natural petulance aggravated by the\ndulness of life in Barbados to a lady of her social aspirations. But he\nhad prescribed for her none the less, and she had conceived herself the\nbetter for his prescription. After that the fame of him had gone through\nBridgetown, and Colonel Bishop had found that there was more profit to\nbe made out of this new slave by leaving him to pursue his profession\nthan by setting him to work on the plantations, for which purpose he had\nbeen originally acquired.\n\n\"It is yourself, madam, I have to thank for my comparatively easy\nand clean condition,\" said Mr. Blood, \"and I am glad to take this\nopportunity of doing so.\"\n\nThe gratitude was in his words rather than in his tone. Was he mocking,\nshe wondered, and looked at him with the searching frankness that\nanother might have found disconcerting. He took the glance for a\nquestion, and answered it.\n\n\"If some other planter had bought me,\" he explained, \"it is odds that\nthe facts of my shining abilities might never have been brought to\nlight, and I should be hewing and hoeing at this moment like the poor\nwretches who were landed with me.\"\n\n\"And why do you thank me for that? It was my uncle who bought you.\"\n\n\"But he would not have done so had you not urged him. I perceived your\ninterest. At the time I resented it.\"\n\n\"You resented it?\" There was a challenge in her boyish voice.\n\n\"I have had no lack of experiences of this mortal life; but to be\nbought and sold was a new one, and I was hardly in the mood to love my\npurchaser.\"\n\n\"If I urged you upon my uncle, sir, it was that I commiserated you.\"\nThere was a slight severity in her tone, as if to reprove the mixture of\nmockery and flippancy in which he seemed to be speaking.\n\nShe proceeded to explain herself. \"My uncle may appear to you a hard\nman. No doubt he is. They are all hard men, these planters. It is the\nlife, I suppose. But there are others here who are worse. There is Mr.\nCrabston, for instance, up at Speightstown. He was there on the mole,\nwaiting to buy my uncle's leavings, and if you had fallen into his\nhands... A dreadful man. That is why.\"\n\nHe was a little bewildered.\n\n\"This interest in a stranger...\" he began. Then changed the direction of\nhis probe. \"But there were others as deserving of commiseration.\"\n\n\"You did not seem quite like the others.\"\n\n\"I am not,\" said he.\n\n\"Oh!\" She stared at him, bridling a little. \"You have a good opinion of\nyourself.\"\n\n\"On the contrary. The others are all worthy rebels. I am not. That\nis the difference. I was one who had not the wit to see that England\nrequires purifying. I was content to pursue a doctor's trade in\nBridgewater whilst my betters were shedding their blood to drive out an\nunclean tyrant and his rascally crew.\"\n\n\"Sir!\" she checked him. \"I think you are talking treason.\"\n\n\"I hope I am not obscure,\" said he.\n\n\"There are those here who would have you flogged if they heard you.\"\n\n\"The Governor would never allow it. He has the gout, and his lady has\nthe megrims.\"\n\n\"Do you depend upon that?\" She was frankly scornful.\n\n\"You have certainly never had the gout; probably not even the megrims,\"\nsaid he.\n\nShe made a little impatient movement with her hand, and looked away from\nhim a moment, out to sea. Quite suddenly she looked at him again; and\nnow her brows were knit.\n\n\"But if you are not a rebel, how come you here?\"\n\nHe saw the thing she apprehended, and he laughed. \"Faith, now, it's a\nlong story,\" said he.\n\n\"And one perhaps that you would prefer not to tell?\"\n\nBriefly on that he told it her.\n\n\"My God! What an infamy!\" she cried, when he had done.\n\n\"Oh, it's a sweet country England under King James! There's no need to\ncommiserate me further. All things considered I prefer Barbados. Here at\nleast one can believe in God.\"\n\nHe looked first to right, then to left as he spoke, from the distant\nshadowy bulk of Mount Hillbay to the limitless ocean ruffled by the\nwinds of heaven. Then, as if the fair prospect rendered him conscious\nof his own littleness and the insignificance of his woes, he fell\nthoughtful.\n\n\"Is that so difficult elsewhere?\" she asked him, and she was very grave.\n\n\"Men make it so.\"\n\n\"I see.\" She laughed a little, on a note of sadness, it seemed to\nhim. \"I have never deemed Barbados the earthly mirror of heaven,\" she\nconfessed. \"But no doubt you know your world better than I.\" She touched\nher horse with her little silver-hilted whip. \"I congratulate you on\nthis easing of your misfortunes.\"\n\nHe bowed, and she moved on. Her negroes sprang up, and went trotting\nafter her.\n\nAwhile Peter Blood remained standing there, where she left him, conning\nthe sunlit waters of Carlisle Bay below, and the shipping in that\nspacious haven about which the gulls were fluttering noisily.\n\nIt was a fair enough prospect, he reflected, but it was a prison, and in\nannouncing that he preferred it to England, he had indulged that almost\nlaudable form of boasting which lies in belittling our misadventures.\n\nHe turned, and resuming his way, went off in long, swinging strides\ntowards the little huddle of huts built of mud and wattles--a miniature\nvillage enclosed in a stockade which the plantation slaves inhabited,\nand where he, himself, was lodged with them.\n\nThrough his mind sang the line of Lovelace:\n\n  \"Stone walls do not a prison make,\n   Nor iron bars a cage.\"\n\nBut he gave it a fresh meaning, the very converse of that which its\nauthor had intended. A prison, he reflected, was a prison, though it had\nneither walls nor bars, however spacious it might be. And as he realized\nit that morning so he was to realize it increasingly as time sped on.\nDaily he came to think more of his clipped wings, of his exclusion from\nthe world, and less of the fortuitous liberty he enjoyed. Nor did the\ncontrasting of his comparatively easy lot with that of his unfortunate\nfellow-convicts bring him the satisfaction a differently constituted\nmind might have derived from it. Rather did the contemplation of their\nmisery increase the bitterness that was gathering in his soul.\n\nOf the forty-two who had been landed with him from the Jamaica Merchant,\nColonel Bishop had purchased no less than twenty-five. The remainder had\ngone to lesser planters, some of them to Speightstown, and others still\nfarther north. What may have been the lot of the latter he could not\ntell, but amongst Bishop's slaves Peter Blood came and went freely,\nsleeping in their quarters, and their lot he knew to be a brutalizing\nmisery. They toiled in the sugar plantations from sunrise to sunset, and\nif their labours flagged, there were the whips of the overseer and his\nmen to quicken them. They went in rags, some almost naked; they dwelt\nin squalor, and they were ill-nourished on salted meat and maize\ndumplings--food which to many of them was for a season at least so\nnauseating that two of them sickened and died before Bishop remembered\nthat their lives had a certain value in labour to him and yielded to\nBlood's intercessions for a better care of such as fell ill. To curb\ninsubordination, one of them who had rebelled against Kent, the brutal\noverseer, was lashed to death by negroes under his comrades' eyes, and\nanother who had been so misguided as to run away into the woods was\ntracked, brought back, flogged, and then branded on the forehead with\nthe letters \"F. T.,\" that all might know him for a fugitive traitor\nas long as he lived. Fortunately for him the poor fellow died as a\nconsequence of the flogging.\n\nAfter that a dull, spiritless resignation settled down upon the\nremainder. The most mutinous were quelled, and accepted their\nunspeakable lot with the tragic fortitude of despair.\n\nPeter Blood alone, escaping these excessive sufferings, remained\noutwardly unchanged, whilst inwardly the only change in him was a daily\ndeeper hatred of his kind, a daily deeper longing to escape from this\nplace where man defiled so foully the lovely work of his Creator. It was\na longing too vague to amount to a hope. Hope here was inadmissible.\nAnd yet he did not yield to despair. He set a mask of laughter on his\nsaturnine countenance and went his way, treating the sick to the\nprofit of Colonel Bishop, and encroaching further and further upon the\npreserves of the two other men of medicine in Bridgetown.\n\nImmune from the degrading punishments and privations of his\nfellow-convicts, he was enabled to keep his self-respect, and was\ntreated without harshness even by the soulless planter to whom he had\nbeen sold. He owed it all to gout and megrims. He had won the esteem of\nGovernor Steed, and--what is even more important--of Governor Steed's\nlady, whom he shamelessly and cynically flattered and humoured.\n\nOccasionally he saw Miss Bishop, and they seldom met but that she paused\nto hold him in conversation for some moments, evincing her interest\nin him. Himself, he was never disposed to linger. He was not, he told\nhimself, to be deceived by her delicate exterior, her sapling grace, her\neasy, boyish ways and pleasant, boyish voice. In all his life--and it\nhad been very varied--he had never met a man whom he accounted more\nbeastly than her uncle, and he could not dissociate her from the man.\nShe was his niece, of his own blood, and some of the vices of it, some\nof the remorseless cruelty of the wealthy planter must, he argued,\ninhabit that pleasant body of hers. He argued this very often to\nhimself, as if answering and convincing some instinct that pleaded\notherwise, and arguing it he avoided her when it was possible, and was\nfrigidly civil when it was not.\n\nJustifiable as his reasoning was, plausible as it may seem, yet he would\nhave done better to have trusted the instinct that was in conflict\nwith it. Though the same blood ran in her veins as in those of Colonel\nBishop, yet hers was free of the vices that tainted her uncle's, for\nthese vices were not natural to that blood; they were, in his\ncase, acquired. Her father, Tom Bishop--that same Colonel Bishop's\nbrother--had been a kindly, chivalrous, gentle soul, who, broken-hearted\nby the early death of a young wife, had abandoned the Old World and\nsought an anodyne for his grief in the New. He had come out to the\nAntilles, bringing with him his little daughter, then five years of age,\nand had given himself up to the life of a planter. He had prospered\nfrom the first, as men sometimes will who care nothing for prosperity.\nProspering, he had bethought him of his younger brother, a soldier at\nhome reputed somewhat wild. He had advised him to come out to Barbados;\nand the advice, which at another season William Bishop might have\nscorned, reached him at a moment when his wildness was beginning to bear\nsuch fruit that a change of climate was desirable. William came, and\nwas admitted by his generous brother to a partnership in the prosperous\nplantation. Some six years later, when Arabella was fifteen, her father\ndied, leaving her in her uncle's guardianship. It was perhaps his one\nmistake. But the goodness of his own nature coloured his views of other\nmen; moreover, himself, he had conducted the education of his daughter,\ngiving her an independence of character upon which perhaps he counted\nunduly. As things were, there was little love between uncle and niece.\nBut she was dutiful to him, and he was circumspect in his behaviour\nbefore her. All his life, and for all his wildness, he had gone in a\ncertain awe of his brother, whose worth he had the wit to recognize;\nand now it was almost as if some of that awe was transferred to his\nbrother's child, who was also, in a sense, his partner, although she\ntook no active part in the business of the plantations.\n\nPeter Blood judged her--as we are all too prone to judge--upon\ninsufficient knowledge.\n\nHe was very soon to have cause to correct that judgment. One day towards\nthe end of May, when the heat was beginning to grow oppressive, there\ncrawled into Carlisle Bay a wounded, battered English ship, the Pride of\nDevon, her freeboard scarred and broken, her coach a gaping wreck, her\nmizzen so shot away that only a jagged stump remained to tell the place\nwhere it had stood. She had been in action off Martinique with two\nSpanish treasure ships, and although her captain swore that the\nSpaniards had beset him without provocation, it is difficult to avoid a\nsuspicion that the encounter had been brought about quite otherwise. One\nof the Spaniards had fled from the combat, and if the Pride of Devon had\nnot given chase it was probably because she was by then in no case to\ndo so. The other had been sunk, but not before the English ship had\ntransferred to her own hold a good deal of the treasure aboard the\nSpaniard. It was, in fact, one of those piratical affrays which were a\nperpetual source of trouble between the courts of St. James's and the\nEscurial, complaints emanating now from one and now from the other side.\n\nSteed, however, after the fashion of most Colonial governors, was\nwilling enough to dull his wits to the extent of accepting the English\nseaman's story, disregarding any evidence that might belie it. He shared\nthe hatred so richly deserved by arrogant, overbearing Spain that\nwas common to men of every other nation from the Bahamas to the Main.\nTherefore he gave the Pride of Devon the shelter she sought in his\nharbour and every facility to careen and carry out repairs.\n\nBut before it came to this, they fetched from her hold over a score of\nEnglish seamen as battered and broken as the ship herself, and together\nwith these some half-dozen Spaniards in like case, the only survivors of\na boarding party from the Spanish galleon that had invaded the English\nship and found itself unable to retreat. These wounded men were conveyed\nto a long shed on the wharf, and the medical skill of Bridgetown was\nsummoned to their aid. Peter Blood was ordered to bear a hand in this\nwork, and partly because he spoke Castilian--and he spoke it as fluently\nas his own native tongue--partly because of his inferior condition as a\nslave, he was given the Spaniards for his patients.\n\nNow Blood had no cause to love Spaniards. His two years in a Spanish\nprison and his subsequent campaigning in the Spanish Netherlands had\nshown him a side of the Spanish character which he had found anything\nbut admirable. Nevertheless he performed his doctor's duties zealously\nand painstakingly, if emotionlessly, and even with a certain superficial\nfriendliness towards each of his patients. These were so surprised at\nhaving their wounds healed instead of being summarily hanged that they\nmanifested a docility very unusual in their kind. They were shunned,\nhowever, by all those charitably disposed inhabitants of Bridgetown who\nflocked to the improvised hospital with gifts of fruit and flowers and\ndelicacies for the injured English seamen. Indeed, had the wishes of\nsome of these inhabitants been regarded, the Spaniards would have been\nleft to die like vermin, and of this Peter Blood had an example almost\nat the very outset.\n\nWith the assistance of one of the negroes sent to the shed for the\npurpose, he was in the act of setting a broken leg, when a deep, gruff\nvoice, that he had come to know and dislike as he had never disliked the\nvoice of living man, abruptly challenged him.\n\n\"What are you doing there?\"\n\nBlood did not look up from his task. There was not the need. He knew the\nvoice, as I have said.\n\n\"I am setting a broken leg,\" he answered, without pausing in his\nlabours.\n\n\"I can see that, fool.\" A bulky body interposed between Peter Blood and\nthe window. The half-naked man on the straw rolled his black eyes to\nstare up fearfully out of a clay-coloured face at this intruder. A\nknowledge of English was unnecessary to inform him that here came an\nenemy. The harsh, minatory note of that voice sufficiently expressed the\nfact. \"I can see that, fool; just as I can see what the rascal is. Who\ngave you leave to set Spanish legs?\"\n\n\"I am a doctor, Colonel Bishop. The man is wounded. It is not for me to\ndiscriminate. I keep to my trade.\"\n\n\"Do you, by God! If you'd done that, you wouldn't now be here.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, it is because I did it that I am here.\"\n\n\"Aye, I know that's your lying tale.\" The Colonel sneered; and then,\nobserving Blood to continue his work unmoved, he grew really angry.\n\"Will you cease that, and attend to me when I am speaking?\"\n\nPeter Blood paused, but only for an instant. \"The man is in pain,\" he\nsaid shortly, and resumed his work.\n\n\"In pain, is he? I hope he is, the damned piratical dog. But will you\nheed me, you insubordinate knave?\"\n\nThe Colonel delivered himself in a roar, infuriated by what he conceived\nto be defiance, and defiance expressing itself in the most unruffled\ndisregard of himself. His long bamboo cane was raised to strike. Peter\nBlood's blue eyes caught the flash of it, and he spoke quickly to arrest\nthe blow.\n\n\"Not insubordinate, sir, whatever I may be. I am acting upon the express\norders of Governor Steed.\"\n\nThe Colonel checked, his great face empurpling. His mouth fell open.\n\n\"Governor Steed!\" he echoed. Then he lowered his cane, swung round, and\nwithout another word to Blood rolled away towards the other end of the\nshed where the Governor was standing at the moment.\n\nPeter Blood chuckled. But his triumph was dictated less by humanitarian\nconsiderations than by the reflection that he had baulked his brutal\nowner.\n\nThe Spaniard, realizing that in this altercation, whatever its nature,\nthe doctor had stood his friend, ventured in a muted voice to ask him\nwhat had happened. But the doctor shook his head in silence, and pursued\nhis work. His ears were straining to catch the words now passing between\nSteed and Bishop. The Colonel was blustering and storming, the great\nbulk of him towering above the wizened little overdressed figure of the\nGovernor. But the little fop was not to be browbeaten. His excellency\nwas conscious that he had behind him the force of public opinion to\nsupport him. Some there might be, but they were not many, who held such\nruthless views as Colonel Bishop. His excellency asserted his authority.\nIt was by his orders that Blood had devoted himself to the wounded\nSpaniards, and his orders were to be carried out. There was no more to\nbe said.\n\nColonel Bishop was of another opinion. In his view there was a\ngreat deal to be said. He said it, with great circumstance, loudly,\nvehemently, obscenely--for he could be fluently obscene when moved to\nanger.\n\n\"You talk like a Spaniard, Colonel,\" said the Governor, and thus dealt\nthe Colonel's pride a wound that was to smart resentfully for many a\nweek. At the moment it struck him silent, and sent him stamping out of\nthe shed in a rage for which he could find no words.\n\nIt was two days later when the ladies of Bridgetown, the wives and\ndaughters of her planters and merchants, paid their first visit of\ncharity to the wharf, bringing their gifts to the wounded seamen.\n\nAgain Peter Blood was there, ministering to the sufferers in his care,\nmoving among those unfortunate Spaniards whom no one heeded. All the\ncharity, all the gifts were for the members of the crew of the Pride\nof Devon. And this Peter Blood accounted natural enough. But rising\nsuddenly from the re-dressing of a wound, a task in which he had\nbeen absorbed for some moments, he saw to his surprise that one lady,\ndetached from the general throng, was placing some plantains and a\nbundle of succulent sugar cane on the cloak that served one of his\npatients for a coverlet. She was elegantly dressed in lavender silk and\nwas followed by a half-naked negro carrying a basket.\n\nPeter Blood, stripped of his coat, the sleeves of his coarse shirt\nrolled to the elbow, and holding a bloody rag in his hand, stood at gaze\na moment. The lady, turning now to confront him, her lips parting in a\nsmile of recognition, was Arabella Bishop.\n\n\"The man's a Spaniard,\" said he, in the tone of one who corrects a\nmisapprehension, and also tinged never so faintly by something of the\nderision that was in his soul.\n\nThe smile with which she had been greeting him withered on her lips. She\nfrowned and stared at him a moment, with increasing haughtiness.\n\n\"So I perceive. But he's a human being none the less,\" said she.\n\nThat answer, and its implied rebuke, took him by surprise.\n\n\"Your uncle, the Colonel, is of a different opinion,\" said he, when he\nhad recovered. \"He regards them as vermin to be left to languish and die\nof their festering wounds.\"\n\nShe caught the irony now more plainly in his voice. She continued to\nstare at him.\n\n\"Why do you tell me this?\"\n\n\"To warn you that you may be incurring the Colonel's displeasure. If\nhe had had his way, I should never have been allowed to dress their\nwounds.\"\n\n\"And you thought, of course, that I must be of my uncle's mind?\" There\nwas a crispness about her voice, an ominous challenging sparkle in her\nhazel eyes.\n\n\"I'd not willingly be rude to a lady even in my thoughts,\" said he. \"But\nthat you should bestow gifts on them, considering that if your uncle\ncame to hear of it....\" He paused, leaving the sentence unfinished. \"Ah,\nwell--there it is!\" he concluded.\n\nBut the lady was not satisfied at all.\n\n\"First you impute to me inhumanity, and then cowardice. Faith! For a\nman who would not willingly be rude to a lady even in his thoughts, it's\nnone so bad.\" Her boyish laugh trilled out, but the note of it jarred\nhis ears this time.\n\nHe saw her now, it seemed to him, for the first time, and saw how he had\nmisjudged her.\n\n\"Sure, now, how was I to guess that... that Colonel Bishop could have\nan angel for his niece?\" said he recklessly, for he was reckless as men\noften are in sudden penitence.\n\n\"You wouldn't, of course. I shouldn't think you often guess aright.\"\nHaving withered him with that and her glance, she turned to her negro\nand the basket that he carried. From this she lifted now the fruits and\ndelicacies with which it was laden, and piled them in such heaps upon\nthe beds of the six Spaniards that by the time she had so served the\nlast of them her basket was empty, and there was nothing left for her\nown fellow-countrymen. These, indeed, stood in no need of her bounty--as\nshe no doubt observed--since they were being plentifully supplied by\nothers.\n\nHaving thus emptied her basket, she called her negro, and without\nanother word or so much as another glance at Peter Blood, swept out of\nthe place with her head high and chin thrust forward.\n\nPeter watched her departure. Then he fetched a sigh.\n\nIt startled him to discover that the thought that he had incurred her\nanger gave him concern. It could not have been so yesterday. It became\nso only since he had been vouchsafed this revelation of her true nature.\n\"Bad cess to it now, it serves me right. It seems I know nothing at all\nof human nature. But how the devil was I to guess that a family that can\nbreed a devil like Colonel Bishop should also breed a saint like this?\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. PLANS OF ESCAPE\n\nAfter that Arabella Bishop went daily to the shed on the wharf with\ngifts of fruit, and later of money and of wearing apparel for the\nSpanish prisoners. But she contrived so to time her visits that Peter\nBlood never again met her there. Also his own visits were growing\nshorter in a measure as his patients healed. That they all throve and\nreturned to health under his care, whilst fully one third of the wounded\nin the care of Whacker and Bronson--the two other surgeons--died\nof their wounds, served to increase the reputation in which this\nrebel-convict stood in Bridgetown. It may have been no more than the\nfortune of war. But the townsfolk did not choose so to regard it. It\nled to a further dwindling of the practices of his free colleagues and a\nfurther increase of his own labours and his owner's profit. Whacker\nand Bronson laid their heads together to devise a scheme by which this\nintolerable state of things should be brought to an end. But that is to\nanticipate.\n\nOne day, whether by accident or design, Peter Blood came striding down\nthe wharf a full half-hour earlier than usual, and so met Miss Bishop\njust issuing from the shed. He doffed his hat and stood aside to give\nher passage. She took it, chin in the air, and eyes which disdained to\nlook anywhere where the sight of him was possible.\n\n\"Miss Arabella,\" said he, on a coaxing, pleading note.\n\nShe grew conscious of his presence, and looked him over with an air that\nwas faintly, mockingly searching.\n\n\"La!\" said she. \"It's the delicate-minded gentleman!\"\n\nPeter groaned. \"Am I so hopelessly beyond forgiveness? I ask it very\nhumbly.\"\n\n\"What condescension!\"\n\n\"It is cruel to mock me,\" said he, and adopted mock-humility. \"After\nall, I am but a slave. And you might be ill one of these days.\"\n\n\"What, then?\"\n\n\"It would be humiliating to send for me if you treat me like an enemy.\"\n\n\"You are not the only doctor in Bridgetown.\"\n\n\"But I am the least dangerous.\"\n\nShe grew suddenly suspicious of him, aware that he was permitting\nhimself to rally her, and in a measure she had already yielded to it.\nShe stiffened, and looked him over again.\n\n\"You make too free, I think,\" she rebuked him.\n\n\"A doctor's privilege.\"\n\n\"I am not your patient. Please to remember it in future.\" And on that,\nunquestionably angry, she departed.\n\n\"Now is she a vixen or am I a fool, or is it both?\" he asked the blue\nvault of heaven, and then went into the shed.\n\nIt was to be a morning of excitements. As he was leaving an hour or so\nlater, Whacker, the younger of the other two physicians, joined him--an\nunprecedented condescension this, for hitherto neither of them had\naddressed him beyond an occasional and surly \"good-day!\"\n\n\"If you are for Colonel Bishop's, I'll walk with you a little way,\nDoctor Blood,\" said he. He was a short, broad man of five-and-forty with\npendulous cheeks and hard blue eyes.\n\nPeter Blood was startled. But he dissembled it.\n\n\"I am for Government House,\" said he.\n\n\"Ah! To be sure! The Governor's lady.\" And he laughed; or perhaps he\nsneered. Peter Blood was not quite certain. \"She encroaches a deal upon\nyour time, I hear. Youth and good looks, Doctor Blood! Youth and\ngood looks! They are inestimable advantages in our profession as in\nothers--particularly where the ladies are concerned.\"\n\nPeter stared at him. \"If you mean what you seem to mean, you had better\nsay it to Governor Steed. It may amuse him.\"\n\n\"You surely misapprehend me.\"\n\n\"I hope so.\"\n\n\"You're so very hot, now!\" The doctor linked his arm through Peter's.\n\"I protest I desire to be your friend--to serve you. Now, listen.\"\nInstinctively his voice grew lower. \"This slavery in which you find\nyourself must be singularly irksome to a man of parts such as yourself.\"\n\n\"What intuitions!\" cried sardonic Mr. Blood. But the doctor took him\nliterally.\n\n\"I am no fool, my dear doctor. I know a man when I see one, and often I\ncan tell his thoughts.\"\n\n\"If you can tell me mine, you'll persuade me of it,\" said Mr. Blood.\n\nDr. Whacker drew still closer to him as they stepped along the wharf. He\nlowered his voice to a still more confidential tone. His hard blue eyes\npeered up into the swart, sardonic face of his companion, who was a head\ntaller than himself.\n\n\"How often have I not seen you staring out over the sea, your soul in\nyour eyes! Don't I know what you are thinking? If you could escape from\nthis hell of slavery, you could exercise the profession of which you\nare an ornament as a free man with pleasure and profit to yourself. The\nworld is large. There are many nations besides England where a man of\nyour parts would be warmly welcomed. There are many colonies besides\nthese English ones.\" Lower still came the voice until it was no more\nthan a whisper. Yet there was no one within earshot. \"It is none so far\nnow to the Dutch settlement of Curacao. At this time of the year the\nvoyage may safely be undertaken in a light craft. And Curacao need be no\nmore than a stepping-stone to the great world, which would lie open to\nyou once you were delivered from this bondage.\"\n\nDr. Whacker ceased. He was pale and a little out of breath. But his hard\neyes continued to study his impassive companion.\n\n\"Well?\" he said alter a pause. \"What do you say to that?\"\n\nYet Blood did not immediately answer. His mind was heaving in tumult,\nand he was striving to calm it that he might take a proper survey of\nthis thing flung into it to create so monstrous a disturbance. He began\nwhere another might have ended.\n\n\"I have no money. And for that a handsome sum would be necessary.\"\n\n\"Did I not say that I desired to be your friend?\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Peter Blood at point-blank range.\n\nBut he never heeded the answer. Whilst Dr. Whacker was professing that\nhis heart bled for a brother doctor languishing in slavery, denied the\nopportunity which his gifts entitled him to make for himself, Peter\nBlood pounced like a hawk upon the obvious truth. Whacker and his\ncolleague desired to be rid of one who threatened to ruin them.\nSluggishness of decision was never a fault of Blood's. He leapt where\nanother crawled. And so this thought of evasion never entertained until\nplanted there now by Dr. Whacker sprouted into instant growth.\n\n\"I see, I see,\" he said, whilst his companion was still talking,\nexplaining, and to save Dr. Whacker's face he played the hypocrite. \"It\nis very noble in you--very brotherly, as between men of medicine. It is\nwhat I myself should wish to do in like case.\"\n\nThe hard eyes flashed, the husky voice grew tremulous as the other asked\nalmost too eagerly:\n\n\"You agree, then? You agree?\"\n\n\"Agree?\" Blood laughed. \"If I should be caught and brought back, they'd\nclip my wings and brand me for life.\"\n\n\"Surely the thing is worth a little risk?\" More tremulous than ever was\nthe tempter's voice.\n\n\"Surely,\" Blood agreed. \"But it asks more than courage. It asks money. A\nsloop might be bought for twenty pounds, perhaps.\"\n\n\"It shall be forthcoming. It shall be a loan, which you shall repay\nus--repay me, when you can.\"\n\nThat betraying \"us\" so hastily retrieved completed Blood's\nunderstanding. The other doctor was also in the business.\n\nThey were approaching the peopled part of the mole. Quickly, but\neloquently, Blood expressed his thanks, where he knew that no thanks\nwere due.\n\n\"We will talk of this again, sir--to-morrow,\" he concluded. \"You have\nopened for me the gates of hope.\"\n\nIn that at least he tittered no more than the bare truth, and expressed\nit very baldly. It was, indeed, as if a door had been suddenly flung\nopen to the sunlight for escape from a dark prison in which a man had\nthought to spend his life.\n\nHe was in haste now to be alone, to straighten out his agitated mind\nand plan coherently what was to be done. Also he must consult another.\nAlready he had hit upon that other. For such a voyage a navigator would\nbe necessary, and a navigator was ready to his hand in Jeremy Pitt. The\nfirst thing was to take counsel with the young shipmaster, who must be\nassociated with him in this business if it were to be undertaken. All\nthat day his mind was in turmoil with this new hope, and he was sick\nwith impatience for night and a chance to discuss the matter with\nhis chosen partner. As a result Blood was betimes that evening in the\nspacious stockade that enclosed the huts of the slaves together with the\nbig white house of the overseer, and he found an opportunity of a few\nwords with Pitt, unobserved by the others.\n\n\"To-night when all are asleep, come to my cabin. I have something to say\nto you.\"\n\nThe young man stared at him, roused by Blood's pregnant tone out of the\nmental lethargy into which he had of late been lapsing as a result of\nthe dehumanizing life he lived. Then he nodded understanding and assent,\nand they moved apart.\n\nThe six months of plantation life in Barbados had made an almost tragic\nmark upon the young seaman. His erstwhile bright alertness was\nall departed. His face was growing vacuous, his eyes were dull and\nlack-lustre, and he moved in a cringing, furtive manner, like an\nover-beaten dog. He had survived the ill-nourishment, the excessive\nwork on the sugar plantation under a pitiless sun, the lashes of the\noverseer's whip when his labours flagged, and the deadly, unrelieved\nanimal life to which he was condemned. But the price he was paying for\nsurvival was the usual price. He was in danger of becoming no better\nthan an animal, of sinking to the level of the negroes who sometimes\ntoiled beside him. The man, however, was still there, not yet dormant,\nbut merely torpid from a surfeit of despair; and the man in him promptly\nshook off that torpidity and awoke at the first words Blood spoke to him\nthat night--awoke and wept.\n\n\"Escape?\" he panted. \"O God!\" He took his head in his hands, and fell to\nsobbing like a child.\n\n\"Sh! Steady now! Steady!\" Blood admonished him in a whisper, alarmed by\nthe lad's blubbering. He crossed to Pitt's side, and set a restraining\nhand upon his shoulder. \"For God's sake, command yourself. If we're\noverheard we shall both be flogged for this.\"\n\nAmong the privileges enjoyed by Blood was that of a hut to himself, and\nthey were alone in this. But, after all, it was built of wattles thinly\nplastered with mud, and its door was composed of bamboos, through which\nsound passed very easily. Though the stockade was locked for the night,\nand all within it asleep by now--it was after midnight--yet a prowling\noverseer was not impossible, and a sound of voices must lead to\ndiscovery. Pitt realized this, and controlled his outburst of emotion.\n\nSitting close thereafter they talked in whispers for an hour or more,\nand all the while those dulled wits of Pitt's were sharpening themselves\nanew upon this precious whetstone of hope. They would need to recruit\nothers into their enterprise, a half-dozen at least, a half-score if\npossible, but no more than that. They must pick the best out of that\nscore of survivors of the Monmouth men that Colonel Bishop had acquired.\nMen who understood the sea were desirable. But of these there were only\ntwo in that unfortunate gang, and their knowledge was none too full.\nThey were Hagthorpe, a gentleman who had served in the Royal Navy, and\nNicholas Dyke, who had been a petty officer in the late king's time, and\nthere was another who had been a gunner, a man named Ogle.\n\nIt was agreed before they parted that Pitt should begin with these three\nand then proceed to recruit some six or eight others. He was to move\nwith the utmost caution, sounding his men very carefully before making\nanything in the nature of a disclosure, and even then avoid rendering\nthat disclosure so full that its betrayal might frustrate the plans\nwhich as yet had to be worked out in detail. Labouring with them in\nthe plantations, Pitt would not want for opportunities of broaching the\nmatter to his fellow-slaves.\n\n\"Caution above everything,\" was Blood's last recommendation to him at\nparting. \"Who goes slowly, goes safely, as the Italians have it. And\nremember that if you betray yourself, you ruin all, for you are the only\nnavigator amongst us, and without you there is no escaping.\"\n\nPitt reassured him, and slunk off back to his own hut and the straw that\nserved him for a bed.\n\nComing next morning to the wharf, Blood found Dr. Whacker in a generous\nmood. Having slept on the matter, he was prepared to advance the convict\nany sum up to thirty pounds that would enable him to acquire a boat\ncapable of taking him away from the settlement. Blood expressed his\nthanks becomingly, betraying no sign that he saw clearly into the true\nreason of the other's munificence.\n\n\"It's not money I'll require,\" said he, \"but the boat itself. For\nwho will be selling me a boat and incurring the penalties in Governor\nSteed's proclamation? Ye'll have read it, no doubt?\"\n\nDr. Whacker's heavy face grew overcast. Thoughtfully he rubbed his chin.\n\"I've read it--yes. And I dare not procure the boat for you. It would be\ndiscovered. It must be. And the penalty is a fine of two hundred pounds\nbesides imprisonment. It would ruin me. You'll see that?\"\n\nThe high hopes in Blood's soul, began to shrink. And the shadow of his\ndespair overcast his face.\n\n\"But then...\" he faltered. \"There is nothing to be done.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay: things are not so desperate.\" Dr. Whacker smiled a little\nwith tight lips. \"I've thought of it. You will see that the man who buys\nthe boat must be one of those who goes with you--so that he is not here\nto answer questions afterwards.\"\n\n\"But who is to go with me save men in my own case? What I cannot do,\nthey cannot.\"\n\n\"There are others detained on the island besides slaves. There are\nseveral who are here for debt, and would be glad enough to spread\ntheir wings. There's a fellow Nuttall, now, who follows the trade of\na shipwright, whom I happen to know would welcome such a chance as you\nmight afford him.\"\n\n\"But how should a debtor come with money to buy a boat? The question\nwill be asked.\"\n\n\"To be sure it will. But if you contrive shrewdly, you'll all be gone\nbefore that happens.\"\n\nBlood nodded understanding, and the doctor, setting a hand upon his\nsleeve, unfolded the scheme he had conceived.\n\n\"You shall have the money from me at once. Having received it, you'll\nforget that it was I who supplied it to you. You have friends in\nEngland--relatives, perhaps--who sent it out to you through the agency\nof one of your Bridgetown patients, whose name as a man of honour you\nwill on no account divulge lest you bring trouble upon him. That is your\ntale if there are questions.\"\n\nHe paused, looking hard at Blood. Blood nodded understanding and assent.\nRelieved, the doctor continued:\n\n\"But there should be no questions if you go carefully to work. You\nconcert matters with Nuttall. You enlist him as one of your companions\nand a shipwright should be a very useful member of your crew. You engage\nhim to discover a likely sloop whose owner is disposed to sell. Then let\nyour preparations all be made before the purchase is effected, so that\nyour escape may follow instantly upon it before the inevitable questions\ncome to be asked. You take me?\"\n\nSo well did Blood take him that within an hour he contrived to see\nNuttall, and found the fellow as disposed to the business as Dr. Whacker\nhad predicted. When he left the shipwright, it was agreed that Nuttall\nshould seek the boat required, for which Blood would at once produce the\nmoney.\n\nThe quest took longer than was expected by Blood, who waited impatiently\nwith the doctor's gold concealed about his person. But at the end of\nsome three weeks, Nuttall--whom he was now meeting daily--informed him\nthat he had found a serviceable wherry, and that its owner was disposed\nto sell it for twenty-two pounds. That evening, on the beach, remote\nfrom all eyes, Peter Blood handed that sum to his new associate, and\nNuttall went off with instructions to complete the purchase late on the\nfollowing day. He was to bring the boat to the wharf, where under cover\nof night Blood and his fellow-convicts would join him and make off.\n\nEverything was ready. In the shed, from which all the wounded men had\nnow been removed and which had since remained untenanted, Nuttall had\nconcealed the necessary stores: a hundredweight of bread, a quantity\nof cheese, a cask of water and some few bottles of Canary, a compass,\nquadrant, chart, half-hour glass, log and line, a tarpaulin, some\ncarpenter's tools, and a lantern and candles. And in the stockade, all\nwas likewise in readiness. Hagthorpe, Dyke, and Ogle had agreed to join\nthe venture, and eight others had been carefully recruited. In Pitt's\nhut, which he shared with five other rebels-convict, all of whom were\nto join in this bid for liberty, a ladder had been constructed in secret\nduring those nights of waiting. With this they were to surmount the\nstockade and gain the open. The risk of detection, so that they made\nlittle noise, was negligible. Beyond locking them all into that stockade\nat night, there was no great precaution taken. Where, after all, could\nany so foolish as to attempt escape hope to conceal himself in that\nisland? The chief risk lay in discovery by those of their companions\nwho were to be left behind. It was because of these that they must go\ncautiously and in silence.\n\nThe day that was to have been their last in Barbados was a day of hope\nand anxiety to the twelve associates in that enterprise, no less than to\nNuttall in the town below.\n\nTowards sunset, having seen Nuttall depart to purchase and fetch\nthe sloop to the prearranged moorings at the wharf, Peter Blood came\nsauntering towards the stockade, just as the slaves were being driven\nin from the fields. He stood aside at the entrance to let them pass, and\nbeyond the message of hope flashed by his eyes, he held no communication\nwith them.\n\nHe entered the stockade in their wake, and as they broke their ranks\nto seek their various respective huts, he beheld Colonel Bishop in talk\nwith Kent, the overseer. The pair were standing by the stocks, planted\nin the middle of that green space for the punishment of offending\nslaves.\n\nAs he advanced, Bishop turned to regard him, scowling. \"Where have you\nbeen this while?\" he bawled, and although a minatory note was normal to\nthe Colonel's voice, yet Blood felt his heart tightening apprehensively.\n\n\"I've been at my work in the town,\" he answered. \"Mrs. Patch has a fever\nand Mr. Dekker has sprained his ankle.\"\n\n\"I sent for you to Dekker's, and you were not there. You are given to\nidling, my fine fellow. We shall have to quicken you one of these days\nunless you cease from abusing the liberty you enjoy. D'ye forget that\nye're a rebel convict?\"\n\n\"I am not given the chance,\" said Blood, who never could learn to curb\nhis tongue.\n\n\"By God! Will you be pert with me?\"\n\nRemembering all that was at stake, growing suddenly conscious that\nfrom the huts surrounding the enclosure anxious ears were listening, he\ninstantly practised an unusual submission.\n\n\"Not pert, sir. I... I am sorry I should have been sought....\"\n\n\"Aye, and you'll be sorrier yet. There's the Governor with an attack of\ngout, screaming like a wounded horse, and you nowhere to be found. Be\noff, man--away with you at speed to Government House! You're awaited,\nI tell you. Best lend him a horse, Kent, or the lout'll be all night\ngetting there.\"\n\nThey bustled him away, choking almost from a reluctance that he dared\nnot show. The thing was unfortunate; but after all not beyond remedy.\nThe escape was set for midnight, and he should easily be back by then.\nHe mounted the horse that Kent procured him, intending to make all\nhaste.\n\n\"How shall I reenter the stockade, sir?\" he enquired at parting.\n\n\"You'll not reenter it,\" said Bishop. \"When they've done with you at\nGovernment House, they may find a kennel for you there until morning.\"\n\nPeter Blood's heart sank like a stone through water.\n\n\"But...\" he began.\n\n\"Be off, I say. Will you stand there talking until dark? His excellency\nis waiting for you.\" And with his cane Colonel Bishop slashed the\nhorse's quarters so brutally that the beast bounded forward all but\nunseating her rider.\n\nPeter Blood went off in a state of mind bordering on despair. And\nthere was occasion for it. A postponement of the escape at least until\nto-morrow night was necessary now, and postponement must mean the\ndiscovery of Nuttall's transaction and the asking of questions it would\nbe difficult to answer.\n\nIt was in his mind to slink back in the night, once his work at\nGovernment House were done, and from the outside of the stockade make\nknown to Pitt and the others his presence, and so have them join him\nthat their project might still be carried out. But in this he reckoned\nwithout the Governor, whom he found really in the thrall of a severe\nattack of gout, and almost as severe an attack of temper nourished by\nBlood's delay.\n\nThe doctor was kept in constant attendance upon him until long after\nmidnight, when at last he was able to ease the sufferer a little by a\nbleeding. Thereupon he would have withdrawn. But Steed would not hear of\nit. Blood must sleep in his own chamber to be at hand in case of need.\nIt was as if Fate made sport of him. For that night at least the escape\nmust be definitely abandoned.\n\nNot until the early hours of the morning did Peter Blood succeed in\nmaking a temporary escape from Government House on the ground that he\nrequired certain medicaments which he must, himself, procure from the\napothecary.\n\nOn that pretext, he made an excursion into the awakening town, and\nwent straight to Nuttall, whom he found in a state of livid panic. The\nunfortunate debtor, who had sat up waiting through the night, conceived\nthat all was discovered and that his own ruin would be involved. Peter\nBlood quieted his fears.\n\n\"It will be for to-night instead,\" he said, with more assurance than\nhe felt, \"if I have to bleed the Governor to death. Be ready as last\nnight.\"\n\n\"But if there are questions meanwhile?\" bleated Nuttall. He was a thin,\npale, small-featured, man with weak eyes that now blinked desperately.\n\n\"Answer as best you can. Use your wits, man. I can stay no longer.\" And\nPeter went off to the apothecary for his pretexted drugs.\n\nWithin an hour of his going came an officer of the Secretary's to\nNuttall's miserable hovel. The seller of the boat had--as by law\nrequired since the coming of the rebels-convict--duly reported the sale\nat the Secretary's office, so that he might obtain the reimbursement\nof the ten-pound surety into which every keeper of a small boat was\ncompelled to enter. The Secretary's office postponed this reimbursement\nuntil it should have obtained confirmation of the transaction.\n\n\"We are informed that you have bought a wherry from Mr. Robert Farrell,\"\nsaid the officer.\n\n\"That is so,\" said Nuttall, who conceived that for him this was the end\nof the world.\n\n\"You are in no haste, it seems, to declare the same at the Secretary's\noffice.\" The emissary had a proper bureaucratic haughtiness.\n\nNuttall's weak eyes blinked at a redoubled rate.\n\n\"To... to declare it?\"\n\n\"Ye know it's the law.\"\n\n\"I... I didn't, may it please you.\"\n\n\"But it's in the proclamation published last January.\"\n\n\"I... I can't read, sir. I... I didn't know.\"\n\n\"Faugh!\" The messenger withered him with his disdain.\n\n\"Well, now you're informed. See to it that you are at the Secretary's\noffice before noon with the ten pounds surety into which you are obliged\nto enter.\"\n\nThe pompous officer departed, leaving Nuttall in a cold perspiration\ndespite the heat of the morning. He was thankful that the fellow had not\nasked the question he most dreaded, which was how he, a debtor, should\ncome by the money to buy a wherry. But this he knew was only a respite.\nThe question would presently be asked of a certainty, and then hell\nwould open for him. He cursed the hour in which he had been such a fool\nas to listen to Peter Blood's chatter of escape. He thought it very\nlikely that the whole plot would be discovered, and that he would\nprobably be hanged, or at least branded and sold into slavery like\nthose other damned rebels-convict, with whom he had been so mad as\nto associate himself. If only he had the ten pounds for this\ninfernal surety, which until this moment had never entered into their\ncalculations, it was possible that the thing might be done quickly\nand questions postponed until later. As the Secretary's messenger had\noverlooked the fact that he was a debtor, so might the others at the\nSecretary's office, at least for a day or two; and in that time he\nwould, he hoped, be beyond the reach of their questions. But in the\nmeantime what was to be done about this money? And it was to be found\nbefore noon!\n\nNuttall snatched up his hat, and went out in quest of Peter Blood.\nBut where look for him? Wandering aimlessly up the irregular, unpaved\nstreet, he ventured to enquire of one or two if they had seen Dr. Blood\nthat morning. He affected to be feeling none so well, and indeed his\nappearance bore out the deception. None could give him information; and\nsince Blood had never told him of Whacker's share in this business, he\nwalked in his unhappy ignorance past the door of the one man in Barbados\nwho would eagerly have saved him in this extremity.\n\nFinally he determined to go up to Colonel Bishop's plantation. Probably\nBlood would be there. If he were not, Nuttall would find Pitt, and leave\na message with him. He was acquainted with Pitt and knew of Pitt's share\nin this business. His pretext for seeking Blood must still be that he\nneeded medical assistance.\n\nAnd at the same time that he set out, insensitive in his anxiety to the\nbroiling heat, to climb the heights to the north of the town, Blood\nwas setting out from Government House at last, having so far eased the\nGovernor's condition as to be permitted to depart. Being mounted, he\nwould, but for an unexpected delay, have reached the stockade ahead of\nNuttall, in which case several unhappy events might have been averted.\nThe unexpected delay was occasioned by Miss Arabella Bishop.\n\nThey met at the gate of the luxuriant garden of Government House, and\nMiss Bishop, herself mounted, stared to see Peter Blood on horseback.\nIt happened that he was in good spirits. The fact that the Governor's\ncondition had so far improved as to restore him his freedom of movement\nhad sufficed to remove the depression under which he had been labouring\nfor the past twelve hours and more. In its rebound the mercury of his\nmood had shot higher far than present circumstances warranted. He was\ndisposed to be optimistic. What had failed last night would certainly\nnot fail again to-night. What was a day, after all? The Secretary's\noffice might be troublesome, but not really troublesome for another\ntwenty-four hours at least; and by then they would be well away.\n\nThis joyous confidence of his was his first misfortune. The next was\nthat his good spirits were also shared by Miss Bishop, and that she\nbore no rancour. The two things conjoined to make the delay that in its\nconsequences was so deplorable.\n\n\"Good-morning, sir,\" she hailed him pleasantly. \"It's close upon a month\nsince last I saw you.\"\n\n\"Twenty-one days to the hour,\" said he. \"I've counted them.\"\n\n\"I vow I was beginning to believe you dead.\"\n\n\"I have to thank you for the wreath.\"\n\n\"The wreath?\"\n\n\"To deck my grave,\" he explained.\n\n\"Must you ever be rallying?\" she wondered, and looked at him gravely,\nremembering that it was his rallying on the last occasion had driven her\naway in dudgeon.\n\n\"A man must sometimes laugh at himself or go mad,\" said he. \"Few realize\nit. That is why there are so many madmen in the world.\"\n\n\"You may laugh at yourself all you will, sir. But sometimes I think you\nlaugh at me, which is not civil.\"\n\n\"Then, faith, you're wrong. I laugh only at the comic, and you are not\ncomic at all.\"\n\n\"What am I, then?\" she asked him, laughing.\n\nA moment he pondered her, so fair and fresh to behold, so entirely\nmaidenly and yet so entirely frank and unabashed.\n\n\"You are,\" he said, \"the niece of the man who owns me his slave.\" But he\nspoke lightly. So lightly that she was encouraged to insistence.\n\n\"Nay, sir, that is an evasion. You shall answer me truthfully this\nmorning.\"\n\n\"Truthfully? To answer you at all is a labour. But to answer truthfully!\nOh, well, now, I should say of you that he'll be lucky who counts you\nhis friend.\" It was in his mind to add more. But he left it there.\n\n\"That's mighty civil,\" said she. \"You've a nice taste in compliments,\nMr. Blood. Another in your place....\"\n\n\"Faith, now, don't I know what another would have said? Don't I know my\nfellow-man at all?\"\n\n\"Sometimes I think you do, and sometimes I think you don't. Anyway, you\ndon't know your fellow-woman. There was that affair of the Spaniards.\"\n\n\"Will ye never forget it?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Bad cess to your memory. Is there no good in me at all that you could\nbe dwelling on instead?\"\n\n\"Oh, several things.\"\n\n\"For instance, now?\" He was almost eager.\n\n\"You speak excellent Spanish.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" He sank back into dismay.\n\n\"Where did you learn it? Have you been in Spain?\"\n\n\"That I have. I was two years in a Spanish prison.\"\n\n\"In prison?\" Her tone suggested apprehensions in which he had no desire\nto leave her.\n\n\"As a prisoner of war,\" he explained. \"I was taken fighting with the\nFrench--in French service, that is.\"\n\n\"But you're a doctor!\" she cried.\n\n\"That's merely a diversion, I think. By trade I am a soldier--at least,\nit's a trade I followed for ten years. It brought me no great gear,\nbut it served me better than medicine, which, as you may observe, has\nbrought me into slavery. I'm thinking it's more pleasing in the sight of\nHeaven to kill men than to heal them. Sure it must be.\"\n\n\"But how came you to be a soldier, and to serve the French?\"\n\n\"I am Irish, you see, and I studied medicine. Therefore--since it's a\nperverse nation we are--.... Oh, but it's a long story, and the Colonel\nwill be expecting my return.\" She was not in that way to be defrauded\nof her entertainment. If he would wait a moment they would ride back\ntogether. She had but come to enquire of the Governor's health at her\nuncle's request.\n\nSo he waited, and so they rode back together to Colonel Bishop's house.\nThey rode very slowly, at a walking pace, and some whom they passed\nmarvelled to see the doctor-slave on such apparently intimate terms with\nhis owner's niece. One or two may have promised themselves that they\nwould drop a hint to the Colonel. But the two rode oblivious of all\nothers in the world that morning. He was telling her the story of his\nearly turbulent days, and at the end of it he dwelt more fully than\nhitherto upon the manner of his arrest and trial.\n\nThe tale was barely done when they drew up at the Colonel's door, and\ndismounted, Peter Blood surrendering his nag to one of the negro grooms,\nwho informed them that the Colonel was from home at the moment.\n\nEven then they lingered a moment, she detaining him.\n\n\"I am sorry, Mr. Blood, that I did not know before,\" she said, and there\nwas a suspicion of moisture in those clear hazel eyes. With a compelling\nfriendliness she held out her hand to him.\n\n\"Why, what difference could it have made?\" he asked.\n\n\"Some, I think. You have been very hardly used by Fate.\"\n\n\"Och, now....\" He paused. His keen sapphire eyes considered her steadily\na moment from under his level black brows. \"It might have been worse,\"\nhe said, with a significance which brought a tinge of colour to her\ncheeks and a flutter to her eyelids.\n\nHe stooped to kiss her hand before releasing it, and she did not deny\nhim. Then he turned and strode off towards the stockade a half-mile\naway, and a vision of her face went with him, tinted with a rising blush\nand a sudden unusual shyness. He forgot in that little moment that he\nwas a rebel-convict with ten years of slavery before him; he forgot\nthat he had planned an escape, which was to be carried into effect\nthat night; forgot even the peril of discovery which as a result of the\nGovernor's gout now overhung him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. PIRATES\n\n\nMr. James Nuttall made all speed, regardless of the heat, in his journey\nfrom Bridgetown to Colonel Bishop's plantation, and if ever man was\nbuilt for speed in a hot climate that man was Mr. James Nuttall, with\nhis short, thin body, and his long, fleshless legs. So withered was\nhe that it was hard to believe there were any juices left in him, yet\njuices there must have been, for he was sweating violently by the time\nhe reached the stockade.\n\nAt the entrance he almost ran into the overseer Kent, a squat,\nbow-legged animal with the arms of a Hercules and the jowl of a bulldog.\n\n\"I am seeking Doctor Blood,\" he announced breathlessly.\n\n\"You are in a rare haste,\" growled Kent. \"What the devil is it? Twins?\"\n\n\"Eh? Oh! Nay, nay. I'm not married, sir. It's a cousin of mine, sir.\"\n\n\"What is?\"\n\n\"He is taken bad, sir,\" Nuttall lied promptly upon the cue that Kent\nhimself had afforded him. \"Is the doctor here?\"\n\n\"That's his hut yonder.\" Kent pointed carelessly. \"If he's not there,\nhe'll be somewhere else.\" And he took himself off. He was a surly,\nungracious beast at all times, readier with the lash of his whip than\nwith his tongue.\n\nNuttall watched him go with satisfaction, and even noted the direction\nthat he took. Then he plunged into the enclosure, to verify in\nmortification that Dr. Blood was not at home. A man of sense might have\nsat down and waited, judging that to be the quickest and surest way in\nthe end. But Nuttall had no sense. He flung out of the stockade again,\nhesitated a moment as to which direction he should take, and finally\ndecided to go any way but the way that Kent had gone. He sped across\nthe parched savannah towards the sugar plantation which stood solid as\na rampart and gleaming golden in the dazzling June sunshine. Avenues\nintersected the great blocks of ripening amber cane. In the distance\ndown one of these he espied some slaves at work. Nuttall entered the\navenue and advanced upon them. They eyed him dully, as he passed them.\nPitt was not of their number, and he dared not ask for him. He continued\nhis search for best part of an hour, up one of those lanes and then\ndown another. Once an overseer challenged him, demanding to know his\nbusiness. He was looking, he said, for Dr. Blood. His cousin was\ntaken ill. The overseer bade him go to the devil, and get out of the\nplantation. Blood was not there. If he was anywhere he would be in his\nhut in the stockade.\n\nNuttall passed on, upon the understanding that he would go. But he went\nin the wrong direction; he went on towards the side of the plantation\nfarthest from the stockade, towards the dense woods that fringed it\nthere. The overseer was too contemptuous and perhaps too languid in the\nstifling heat of approaching noontide to correct his course.\n\nNuttall blundered to the end of the avenue, and round the corner of\nit, and there ran into Pitt, alone, toiling with a wooden spade upon an\nirrigation channel. A pair of cotton drawers, loose and ragged, clothed\nhim from waist to knee; above and below he was naked, save for a broad\nhat of plaited straw that sheltered his unkempt golden head from the\nrays of the tropical sun. At sight of him Nuttall returned thanks aloud\nto his Maker. Pitt stared at him, and the shipwright poured out his\ndismal news in a dismal tone. The sum of it was that he must have ten\npounds from Blood that very morning or they were all undone. And all he\ngot for his pains and his sweat was the condemnation of Jeremy Pitt.\n\n\"Damn you for a fool!\" said the slave. \"If it's Blood you're seeking,\nwhy are you wasting your time here?\"\n\n\"I can't find him,\" bleated Nuttall. He was indignant at his reception.\nHe forgot the jangled state of the other's nerves after a night of\nanxious wakefulness ending in a dawn of despair. \"I thought that\nyou....\"\n\n\"You thought that I could drop my spade and go and seek him for you? Is\nthat what you thought? My God! that our lives should depend upon such a\ndummerhead. While you waste your time here, the hours are passing! And\nif an overseer should catch you talking to me? How'll you explain it?\"\n\nFor a moment Nuttall was bereft of speech by such ingratitude. Then he\nexploded.\n\n\"I would to Heaven I had never had no hand in this affair. I would so! I\nwish that....\"\n\nWhat else he wished was never known, for at that moment round the block\nof cane came a big man in biscuit-coloured taffetas followed by two\nnegroes in cotton drawers who were armed with cutlasses. He was not\nten yards away, but his approach over the soft, yielding marl had been\nunheard.\n\nMr. Nuttall looked wildly this way and that a moment, then bolted like\na rabbit for the woods, thus doing the most foolish and betraying thing\nthat in the circumstances it was possible for him to do. Pitt groaned\nand stood still, leaning upon his spade.\n\n\"Hi, there! Stop!\" bawled Colonel Bishop after the fugitive, and added\nhorrible threats tricked out with some rhetorical indecencies.\n\nBut the fugitive held amain, and never so much as turned his head. It\nwas his only remaining hope that Colonel Bishop might not have seen his\nface; for the power and influence of Colonel Bishop was quite sufficient\nto hang any man whom he thought would be better dead.\n\nNot until the runagate had vanished into the scrub did the planter\nsufficiently recover from his indignant amazement to remember the two\nnegroes who followed at his heels like a brace of hounds. It was a\nbodyguard without which he never moved in his plantations since a slave\nhad made an attack upon him and all but strangled him a couple of years\nago.\n\n\"After him, you black swine!\" he roared at them. But as they started he\nchecked them. \"Wait! Get to heel, damn you!\"\n\nIt occurred to him that to catch and deal with the fellow there was not\nthe need to go after him, and perhaps spend the day hunting him in that\ncursed wood. There was Pitt here ready to his hand, and Pitt should tell\nhim the identity of his bashful friend, and also the subject of that\nclose and secret talk he had disturbed. Pitt might, of course, be\nreluctant. So much the worse for Pitt. The ingenious Colonel Bishop knew\na dozen ways--some of them quite diverting--of conquering stubbornness\nin these convict dogs.\n\nHe turned now upon the slave a countenance that was inflamed by heat\ninternal and external, and a pair of heady eyes that were alight with\ncruel intelligence. He stepped forward swinging his light bamboo cane.\n\n\"Who was that runagate?\" he asked with terrible suavity. Leaning over on\nhis spade, Jeremy Pitt hung his head a little, and shifted uncomfortably\non his bare feet. Vainly he groped for an answer in a mind that could do\nnothing but curse the idiocy of Mr. James Nuttall.\n\nThe planter's bamboo cane fell on the lad's naked shoulders with\nstinging force.\n\n\"Answer me, you dog! What's his name?\"\n\nJeremy looked at the burly planter out of sullen, almost defiant eyes.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said, and in his voice there was a faint note at\nleast of the defiance aroused in him by a blow which he dared not, for\nhis life's sake, return. His body had remained unyielding under it, but\nthe spirit within writhed now in torment.\n\n\"You don't know? Well, here's to quicken your wits.\" Again the cane\ndescended. \"Have you thought of his name yet?\"\n\n\"I have not.\"\n\n\"Stubborn, eh?\" For a moment the Colonel leered. Then his passion\nmastered him. \"'Swounds! You impudent dog! D'you trifle with me? D'you\nthink I'm to be mocked?\"\n\nPitt shrugged, shifted sideways on his feet again, and settled into\ndogged silence. Few things are more provocative; and Colonel Bishop's\ntemper was never one that required much provocation. Brute fury now\nawoke in him. Fiercely now he lashed those defenceless shoulders,\naccompanying each blow by blasphemy and foul abuse, until, stung beyond\nendurance, the lingering embers of his manhood fanned into momentary\nflame, Pitt sprang upon his tormentor.\n\nBut as he sprang, so also sprang the watchful blacks. Muscular bronze\narms coiled crushingly about the frail white body, and in a moment the\nunfortunate slave stood powerless, his wrists pinioned behind him in a\nleathern thong.\n\nBreathing hard, his face mottled, Bishop pondered him a moment. Then:\n\"Fetch him along,\" he said.\n\nDown the long avenue between those golden walls of cane standing some\neight feet high, the wretched Pitt was thrust by his black captors in\nthe Colonel's wake, stared at with fearful eyes by his fellow-slaves at\nwork there. Despair went with him. What torments might immediately await\nhim he cared little, horrible though he knew they would be. The real\nsource of his mental anguish lay in the conviction that the elaborately\nplanned escape from this unutterable hell was frustrated now in the very\nmoment of execution.\n\nThey came out upon the green plateau and headed for the stockade and\nthe overseer's white house. Pitt's eyes looked out over Carlisle Bay, of\nwhich this plateau commanded a clear view from the fort on one side to\nthe long sheds of the wharf on the other. Along this wharf a few shallow\nboats were moored, and Pitt caught himself wondering which of these was\nthe wherry in which with a little luck they might have been now at sea.\nOut over that sea his glance ranged miserably.\n\nIn the roads, standing in for the shore before a gentle breeze that\nscarcely ruffled the sapphire surface of the Caribbean, came a stately\nred-hulled frigate, flying the English ensign.\n\nColonel Bishop halted to consider her, shading his eyes with his fleshly\nhand. Light as was the breeze, the vessel spread no canvas to it beyond\nthat of her foresail. Furled was her every other sail, leaving a clear\nview of the majestic lines of her hull, from towering stern castle to\ngilded beakhead that was aflash in the dazzling sunshine.\n\nSo leisurely an advance argued a master indifferently acquainted with\nthese waters, who preferred to creep forward cautiously, sounding his\nway. At her present rate of progress it would be an hour, perhaps,\nbefore she came to anchorage within the harbour. And whilst the Colonel\nviewed her, admiring, perhaps, the gracious beauty of her, Pitt was\nhurried forward into the stockade, and clapped into the stocks that\nstood there ready for slaves who required correction.\n\nColonel Bishop followed him presently, with leisurely, rolling gait.\n\n\"A mutinous cur that shows his fangs to his master must learn good\nmanners at the cost of a striped hide,\" was all he said before setting\nabout his executioner's job.\n\nThat with his own hands he should do that which most men of his station\nwould, out of self-respect, have relegated to one of the negroes, gives\nyou the measure of the man's beastliness. It was almost as if with\nrelish, as if gratifying some feral instinct of cruelty, that he now\nlashed his victim about head and shoulders. Soon his cane was reduced,\nto splinters by his violence. You know, perhaps, the sting of a flexible\nbamboo cane when it is whole. But do you realize its murderous quality\nwhen it has been split into several long lithe blades, each with an edge\nthat is of the keenness of a knife?\n\nWhen, at last, from very weariness, Colonel Bishop flung away the stump\nand thongs to which his cane had been reduced, the wretched slave's back\nwas bleeding pulp from neck to waist.\n\nAs long as full sensibility remained, Jeremy Pitt had made no sound.\nBut in a measure as from pain his senses were mercifully dulled, he sank\nforward in the stocks, and hung there now in a huddled heap, faintly\nmoaning.\n\nColonel Bishop set his foot upon the crossbar, and leaned over his\nvictim, a cruel smile on his full, coarse face.\n\n\"Let that teach you a proper submission,\" said he. \"And now touching\nthat shy friend of yours, you shall stay here without meat or\ndrink--without meat or drink, d' ye hear me?--until you please to tell\nme his name and business.\" He took his foot from the bar. \"When you've\nhad enough of this, send me word, and we'll have the branding-irons to\nyou.\"\n\nOn that he swung on his heel, and strode out of the stockade, his\nnegroes following.\n\nPitt had heard him, as we hear things in our dreams. At the moment so\nspent was he by his cruel punishment, and so deep was the despair into\nwhich he had fallen, that he no longer cared whether he lived or died.\n\nSoon, however, from the partial stupor which pain had mercifully\ninduced, a new variety of pain aroused him. The stocks stood in the\nopen under the full glare of the tropical sun, and its blistering rays\nstreamed down upon that mangled, bleeding back until he felt as if\nflames of fire were searing it. And, soon, to this was added a torment\nstill more unspeakable. Flies, the cruel flies of the Antilles, drawn by\nthe scent of blood, descended in a cloud upon him.\n\nSmall wonder that the ingenious Colonel Bishop, who so well understood\nthe art of loosening stubborn tongues, had not deemed it necessary to\nhave recourse to other means of torture. Not all his fiendish cruelty\ncould devise a torment more cruel, more unendurable than the torments\nNature would here procure a man in Pitt's condition.\n\nThe slave writhed in his stocks until he was in danger of breaking his\nlimbs, and writhing, screamed in agony.\n\nThus was he found by Peter Blood, who seemed to his troubled vision\nto materialize suddenly before him. Mr. Blood carried a large palmetto\nleaf. Having whisked away with this the flies that were devouring\nJeremy's back, he slung it by a strip of fibre from the lad's neck, so\nthat it protected him from further attacks as well as from the rays of\nthe sun. Next, sitting down beside him, he drew the sufferer's head down\non his own shoulder, and bathed his face from a pannikin of cold water.\nPitt shuddered and moaned on a long, indrawn breath.\n\n\"Drink!\" he gasped. \"Drink, for the love of Christ!\" The pannikin was\nheld to his quivering lips. He drank greedily, noisily, nor ceased\nuntil he had drained the vessel. Cooled and revived by the draught, he\nattempted to sit up.\n\n\"My back!\" he screamed.\n\nThere was an unusual glint in Mr. Blood's eyes; his lips were\ncompressed. But when he parted them to speak, his voice came cool and\nsteady.\n\n\"Be easy, now. One thing at a time. Your back's taking no harm at all\nfor the present, since I've covered it up. I'm wanting to know what's\nhappened to you. D' ye think we can do without a navigator that ye go\nand provoke that beast Bishop until he all but kills you?\"\n\nPitt sat up and groaned again. But this time his anguish was mental\nrather than physical.\n\n\"I don't think a navigator will be needed this time, Peter.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" cried Mr. Blood.\n\nPitt explained the situation as briefly as he could, in a halting,\ngasping speech. \"I'm to rot here until I tell him the identity of my\nvisitor and his business.\"\n\nMr. Blood got up, growling in his throat. \"Bad cess to the filthy\nslaver!\" said he. \"But it must be contrived, nevertheless. To the devil\nwith Nuttall! Whether he gives surety for the boat or not, whether he\nexplains it or not, the boat remains, and we're going, and you're coming\nwith us.\"\n\n\"You're dreaming, Peter,\" said the prisoner. \"We're not going this time.\nThe magistrates will confiscate the boat since the surety's not paid,\neven if when they press him Nuttall does not confess the whole plan and\nget us all branded on the forehead.\"\n\nMr. Blood turned away, and with agony in his eyes looked out to sea over\nthe blue water by which he had so fondly hoped soon to be travelling\nback to freedom.\n\nThe great red ship had drawn considerably nearer shore by now. Slowly,\nmajestically, she was entering the bay. Already one or two wherries were\nputting off from the wharf to board her. From where he stood, Mr. Blood\ncould see the glinting of the brass cannons mounted on the prow above\nthe curving beak-head, and he could make out the figure of a seaman in\nthe forechains on her larboard side, leaning out to heave the lead.\n\nAn angry voice aroused him from his unhappy thoughts.\n\n\"What the devil are you doing here?\"\n\nThe returning Colonel Bishop came striding into the stockade, his\nnegroes following ever.\n\nMr. Blood turned to face him, and over that swarthy countenance--which,\nindeed, by now was tanned to the golden brown of a half-caste Indian--a\nmask descended.\n\n\"Doing?\" said he blandly. \"Why, the duties of my office.\"\n\nThe Colonel, striding furiously forward, observed two things. The\nempty pannikin on the seat beside the prisoner, and the palmetto leaf\nprotecting his back. \"Have you dared to do this?\" The veins on the\nplanter's forehead stood out like cords.\n\n\"Of course I have.\" Mr. Blood's tone was one of faint surprise.\n\n\"I said he was to have neither meat nor drink until I ordered it.\"\n\n\"Sure, now, I never heard ye.\"\n\n\"You never heard me? How should you have heard me when you weren't\nhere?\"\n\n\"Then how did ye expect me to know what orders ye'd given?\" Mr. Blood's\ntone was positively aggrieved. \"All that I knew was that one of your\nslaves was being murthered by the sun and the flies. And I says to\nmyself, this is one of the Colonel's slaves, and I'm the Colonel's\ndoctor, and sure it's my duty to be looking after the Colonel's\nproperty. So I just gave the fellow a spoonful of water and covered his\nback from the sun. And wasn't I right now?\"\n\n\"Right?\" The Colonel was almost speechless.\n\n\"Be easy, now, be easy!\" Mr. Blood implored him. \"It's an apoplexy ye'll\nbe contacting if ye give way to heat like this.\"\n\nThe planter thrust him aside with an imprecation, and stepping forward\ntore the palmetto leaf from the prisoner's back.\n\n\"In the name of humanity, now....\" Mr. Blood was beginning.\n\nThe Colonel swung upon him furiously. \"Out of this!\" he commanded. \"And\ndon't come near him again until I send for you, unless you want to be\nserved in the same way.\"\n\nHe was terrific in his menace, in his bulk, and in the power of him. But\nMr. Blood never flinched. It came to the Colonel, as he found himself\nsteadily regarded by those light-blue eyes that looked so arrestingly\nodd in that tawny face--like pale sapphires set in copper--that this\nrogue had for some time now been growing presumptuous. It was a matter\nthat he must presently correct. Meanwhile Mr. Blood was speaking again,\nhis tone quietly insistent.\n\n\"In the name of humanity,\" he repeated, \"ye'll allow me to do what I can\nto ease his sufferings, or I swear to you that I'll forsake at once the\nduties of a doctor, and that it's devil another patient will I attend in\nthis unhealthy island at all.\"\n\nFor an instant the Colonel was too amazed to speak. Then--\n\n\"By God!\" he roared. \"D'ye dare take that tone with me, you dog? D'ye\ndare to make terms with me?\"\n\n\"I do that.\" The unflinching blue eyes looked squarely into the\nColonel's, and there was a devil peeping out of them, the devil of\nrecklessness that is born of despair.\n\nColonel Bishop considered him for a long moment in silence. \"I've been\ntoo soft with you,\" he said at last. \"But that's to be mended.\" And he\ntightened his lips. \"I'll have the rods to you, until there's not an\ninch of skin left on your dirty back.\"\n\n\"Will ye so? And what would Governor Steed do, then?\"\n\n\"Ye're not the only doctor on the island.\"\n\nMr. Blood actually laughed. \"And will ye tell that to his excellency,\nhim with the gout in his foot so bad that he can't stand? Ye know very\nwell it's devil another doctor will he tolerate, being an intelligent\nman that knows what's good for him.\"\n\nBut the Colonel's brute passion thoroughly aroused was not so easily to\nbe baulked. \"If you're alive when my blacks have done with you, perhaps\nyou'll come to your senses.\"\n\nHe swung to his negroes to issue an order. But it was never issued. At\nthat moment a terrific rolling thunderclap drowned his voice and shook\nthe very air. Colonel Bishop jumped, his negroes jumped with him, and so\neven did the apparently imperturbable Mr. Blood. Then the four of them\nstared together seawards.\n\nDown in the bay all that could be seen of the great ship, standing now\nwithin a cable's-length of the fort, were her topmasts thrusting above\na cloud of smoke in which she was enveloped. From the cliffs a flight\nof startled seabirds had risen to circle in the blue, giving tongue to\ntheir alarm, the plaintive curlew noisiest of all.\n\nAs those men stared from the eminence on which they stood, not yet\nunderstanding what had taken place, they saw the British Jack dip from\nthe main truck and vanish into the rising cloud below. A moment more,\nand up through that cloud to replace the flag of England soared the gold\nand crimson banner of Castile. And then they understood.\n\n\"Pirates!\" roared the Colonel, and again, \"Pirates!\"\n\nFear and incredulity were blent in his voice. He had paled under his tan\nuntil his face was the colour of clay, and there was a wild fury in his\nbeady eyes. His negroes looked at him, grinning idiotically, all teeth\nand eyeballs.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. SPANIARDS\n\n\nThe stately ship that had been allowed to sail so leisurely into\nCarlisle Bay under her false colours was a Spanish privateer, coming to\npay off some of the heavy debt piled up by the predaceous Brethren of\nthe Coast, and the recent defeat by the Pride of Devon of two treasure\ngalleons bound for Cadiz. It happened that the galleon which escaped in\na more or less crippled condition was commanded by Don Diego de Espinosa\ny Valdez, who was own brother to the Spanish Admiral Don Miguel de\nEspinosa, and who was also a very hasty, proud, and hot-tempered\ngentleman.\n\nGalled by his defeat, and choosing to forget that his own conduct had\ninvited it, he had sworn to teach the English a sharp lesson which they\nshould remember. He would take a leaf out of the book of Morgan and\nthose other robbers of the sea, and make a punitive raid upon an English\nsettlement. Unfortunately for himself and for many others, his brother\nthe Admiral was not at hand to restrain him when for this purpose he\nfitted out the Cinco Llagas at San Juan de Porto Rico. He chose for\nhis objective the island of Barbados, whose natural strength was apt to\nrender her defenders careless. He chose it also because thither had the\nPride of Devon been tracked by his scouts, and he desired a measure of\npoetic justice to invest his vengeance. And he chose a moment when there\nwere no ships of war at anchor in Carlisle Bay.\n\nHe had succeeded so well in his intentions that he had aroused no\nsuspicion until he saluted the fort at short range with a broadside of\ntwenty guns.\n\nAnd now the four gaping watchers in the stockade on the headland beheld\nthe great ship creep forward under the rising cloud of smoke,\nher mainsail unfurled to increase her steering way, and go about\nclose-hauled to bring her larboard guns to bear upon the unready fort.\n\nWith the crashing roar of that second broadside, Colonel Bishop awoke\nfrom stupefaction to a recollection of where his duty lay. In the town\nbelow drums were beating frantically, and a trumpet was bleating, as\nif the peril needed further advertising. As commander of the Barbados\nMilitia, the place of Colonel Bishop was at the head of his scanty\ntroops, in that fort which the Spanish guns were pounding into rubble.\n\nRemembering it, he went off at the double, despite his bulk and the\nheat, his negroes trotting after him.\n\nMr. Blood turned to Jeremy Pitt. He laughed grimly. \"Now that,\" said he,\n\"is what I call a timely interruption. Though what'll come of it,\" he\nadded as an afterthought, \"the devil himself knows.\"\n\nAs a third broadside was thundering forth, he picked up the palmetto\nleaf and carefully replaced it on the back of his fellow-slave.\n\nAnd then into the stockade, panting and sweating, came Kent followed by\nbest part of a score of plantation workers, some of whom were black and\nall of whom were in a state of panic. He led them into the low white\nhouse, to bring them forth again, within a moment, as it seemed, armed\nnow with muskets and hangers and some of them equipped with bandoleers.\n\nBy this time the rebels-convict were coming in, in twos and threes,\nhaving abandoned their work upon finding themselves unguarded and upon\nscenting the general dismay.\n\nKent paused a moment, as his hastily armed guard dashed forth, to fling\nan order to those slaves.\n\n\"To the woods!\" he bade them. \"Take to the woods, and lie close there,\nuntil this is over, and we've gutted these Spanish swine.\"\n\nOn that he went off in haste after his men, who were to be added to\nthose massing in the town, so as to oppose and overwhelm the Spanish\nlanding parties.\n\nThe slaves would have obeyed him on the instant but for Mr. Blood.\n\n\"What need for haste, and in this heat?\" quoth he. He was surprisingly\ncool, they thought. \"Maybe there'll be no need to take to the woods at\nall, and, anyway, it will be time enough to do so when the Spaniards are\nmasters of the town.\"\n\nAnd so, joined now by the other stragglers, and numbering in all a\nround score--rebels-convict all--they stayed to watch from their\nvantage-ground the fortunes of the furious battle that was being waged\nbelow.\n\nThe landing was contested by the militia and by every islander capable\nof bearing arms with the fierce resoluteness of men who knew that\nno quarter was to be expected in defeat. The ruthlessness of Spanish\nsoldiery was a byword, and not at his worst had Morgan or L'Ollonais\never perpetrated such horrors as those of which these Castilian\ngentlemen were capable.\n\nBut this Spanish commander knew his business, which was more than could\ntruthfully be said for the Barbados Militia. Having gained the advantage\nof a surprise blow, which had put the fort out of action, he soon showed\nthem that he was master of the situation. His guns turned now upon the\nopen space behind the mole, where the incompetent Bishop had marshalled\nhis men, tore the militia into bloody rags, and covered the landing\nparties which were making the shore in their own boats and in several\nof those which had rashly gone out to the great ship before her identity\nwas revealed.\n\nAll through the scorching afternoon the battle went on, the rattle and\ncrack of musketry penetrating ever deeper into the town to show that\nthe defenders were being driven steadily back. By sunset two hundred and\nfifty Spaniards were masters of Bridgetown, the islanders were disarmed,\nand at Government House, Governor Steed--his gout forgotten in his\npanic--supported by Colonel Bishop and some lesser officers, was being\ninformed by Don Diego, with an urbanity that was itself a mockery, of\nthe sum that would be required in ransom.\n\nFor a hundred thousand pieces of eight and fifty head of cattle, Don\nDiego would forbear from reducing the place to ashes. And what time\nthat suave and courtly commander was settling these details with the\napoplectic British Governor, the Spaniards were smashing and looting,\nfeasting, drinking, and ravaging after the hideous manner of their kind.\n\nMr. Blood, greatly daring, ventured down at dusk into the town. What\nhe saw there is recorded by Jeremy Pitt to whom he subsequently related\nit--in that voluminous log from which the greater part of my narrative\nis derived. I have no intention of repeating any of it here. It is\nall too loathsome and nauseating, incredible, indeed, that men however\nabandoned could ever descend such an abyss of bestial cruelty and lust.\n\nWhat he saw was fetching him in haste and white-faced out of that hell\nagain, when in a narrow street a girl hurtled into him, wild-eyed, her\nunbound hair streaming behind her as she ran. After her, laughing and\ncursing in a breath, came a heavy-booted Spaniard. Almost he was upon\nher, when suddenly Mr. Blood got in his way. The doctor had taken a\nsword from a dead man's side some little time before and armed himself\nwith it against an emergency.\n\nAs the Spaniard checked in anger and surprise, he caught in the dusk the\nlivid gleam of that sword which Mr. Blood had quickly unsheathed.\n\n\"Ah, perro ingles!\" he shouted, and flung forward to his death.\n\n\"It's hoping I am ye're in a fit state to meet your Maker,\" said Mr.\nBlood, and ran him through the body. He did the thing skilfully: with\nthe combined skill of swordsman and surgeon. The man sank in a hideous\nheap without so much as a groan.\n\nMr. Blood swung to the girl, who leaned panting and sobbing against a\nwall. He caught her by the wrist.\n\n\"Come!\" he said.\n\nBut she hung back, resisting him by her weight. \"Who are you?\" she\ndemanded wildly.\n\n\"Will ye wait to see my credentials?\" he snapped. Steps were clattering\ntowards them from beyond the corner round which she had fled from\nthat Spanish ruffian. \"Come,\" he urged again. And this time, reassured\nperhaps by his clear English speech, she went without further questions.\n\nThey sped down an alley and then up another, by great good fortune\nmeeting no one, for already they were on the outskirts of the town. They\nwon out of it, and white-faced, physically sick, Mr. Blood dragged her\nalmost at a run up the hill towards Colonel Bishop's house. He told her\nbriefly who and what he was, and thereafter there was no conversation\nbetween them until they reached the big white house. It was all in\ndarkness, which at least was reassuring. If the Spaniards had reached\nit, there would be lights. He knocked, but had to knock again and yet\nagain before he was answered. Then it was by a voice from a window\nabove.\n\n\"Who is there?\" The voice was Miss Bishop's, a little tremulous, but\nunmistakably her own.\n\nMr. Blood almost fainted in relief. He had been imagining the\nunimaginable. He had pictured her down in that hell out of which he had\njust come. He had conceived that she might have followed her uncle into\nBridgetown, or committed some other imprudence, and he turned cold from\nhead to foot at the mere thought of what might have happened to her.\n\n\"It is I--Peter Blood,\" he gasped.\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\nIt is doubtful whether she would have come down to open. For at such\na time as this it was no more than likely that the wretched plantation\nslaves might be in revolt and prove as great a danger as the Spaniards.\nBut at the sound of her voice, the girl Mr. Blood had rescued peered up\nthrough the gloom.\n\n\"Arabella!\" she called. \"It is I, Mary Traill.\"\n\n\"Mary!\" The voice ceased above on that exclamation, the head was\nwithdrawn. After a brief pause the door gaped wide. Beyond it in\nthe wide hall stood Miss Arabella, a slim, virginal figure in white,\nmysteriously revealed in the gleam of a single candle which she carried.\n\nMr. Blood strode in followed by his distraught companion, who, falling\nupon Arabella's slender bosom, surrendered herself to a passion of\ntears. But he wasted no time.\n\n\"Whom have you here with you? What servants?\" he demanded sharply.\n\nThe only male was James, an old negro groom.\n\n\"The very man,\" said Blood. \"Bid him get out horses. Then away with you\nto Speightstown, or even farther north, where you will be safe. Here you\nare in danger--in dreadful danger.\"\n\n\"But I thought the fighting was over...\" she was beginning, pale and\nstartled.\n\n\"So it is. But the deviltry's only beginning. Miss Traill will tell you\nas you go. In God's name, madam, take my word for it, and do as I bid\nyou.\"\n\n\"He... he saved me,\" sobbed Miss Traill.\n\n\"Saved you?\" Miss Bishop was aghast. \"Saved you from what, Mary?\"\n\n\"Let that wait,\" snapped Mr. Blood almost angrily. \"You've all the night\nfor chattering when you're out of this, and away beyond their reach.\nWill you please call James, and do as I say--and at once!\"\n\n\"You are very peremptory....\"\n\n\"Oh, my God! I am peremptory! Speak, Miss Trail!, tell her whether I've\ncause to be peremptory.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" the girl cried, shuddering. \"Do as he says--Oh, for pity's\nsake, Arabella.\"\n\nMiss Bishop went off, leaving Mr. Blood and Miss Traill alone again.\n\n\"I... I shall never forget what you did, sir,\" said she, through her\ndiminishing tears. She was a slight wisp of a girl, a child, no more.\n\n\"I've done better things in my time. That's why I'm here,\" said Mr.\nBlood, whose mood seemed to be snappy.\n\nShe didn't pretend to understand him, and she didn't make the attempt.\n\n\"Did you... did you kill him?\" she asked, fearfully.\n\nHe stared at her in the flickering candlelight. \"I hope so. It is very\nprobable, and it doesn't matter at all,\" he said. \"What matters is that\nthis fellow James should fetch the horses.\" And he was stamping off to\naccelerate these preparations for departure, when her voice arrested\nhim.\n\n\"Don't leave me! Don't leave me here alone!\" she cried in terror.\n\nHe paused. He turned and came slowly back. Standing above her he smiled\nupon her.\n\n\"There, there! You've no cause for alarm. It's all over now. You'll be\naway soon--away to Speightstown, where you'll be quite safe.\"\n\nThe horses came at last--four of them, for in addition to James who was\nto act as her guide, Miss Bishop had her woman, who was not to be left\nbehind.\n\nMr. Blood lifted the slight weight of Mary Traill to her horse, then\nturned to say good-bye to Miss Bishop, who was already mounted. He\nsaid it, and seemed to have something to add. But whatever it was, it\nremained unspoken. The horses started, and receded into the sapphire\nstarlit night, leaving him standing there before Colonel Bishop's door.\nThe last he heard of them was Mary Traill's childlike voice calling back\non a quavering note--\n\n\"I shall never forget what you did, Mr. Blood. I shall never forget.\"\n\nBut as it was not the voice he desired to hear, the assurance brought\nhim little satisfaction. He stood there in the dark watching the\nfireflies amid the rhododendrons, till the hoofbeats had faded. Then he\nsighed and roused himself. He had much to do. His journey into the town\nhad not been one of idle curiosity to see how the Spaniards conducted\nthemselves in victory. It had been inspired by a very different purpose,\nand he had gained in the course of it all the information he desired. He\nhad an extremely busy night before him, and must be moving.\n\nHe went off briskly in the direction of the stockade, where his\nfellow-slaves awaited him in deep anxiety and some hope.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. THE REBELS-CONVICT\n\n\nThere were, when the purple gloom of the tropical night descended upon\nthe Caribbean, not more than ten men on guard aboard the Cinco Llagas,\nso confident--and with good reason--were the Spaniards of the complete\nsubjection of the islanders. And when I say that there were ten men on\nguard, I state rather the purpose for which they were left aboard than\nthe duty which they fulfilled. As a matter of fact, whilst the main body\nof the Spaniards feasted and rioted ashore, the Spanish gunner and his\ncrew--who had so nobly done their duty and ensured the easy victory of\nthe day--were feasting on the gun-deck upon the wine and the fresh meats\nfetched out to them from shore. Above, two sentinels only kept vigil, at\nstem and stern. Nor were they as vigilant as they should have been, or\nelse they must have observed the two wherries that under cover of the\ndarkness came gliding from the wharf, with well-greased rowlocks, to\nbring up in silence under the great ship's quarter.\n\nFrom the gallery aft still hung the ladder by which Don Diego had\ndescended to the boat that had taken him ashore. The sentry on guard in\nthe stern, coming presently round this gallery, was suddenly confronted\nby the black shadow of a man standing before him at the head of the\nladder.\n\n\"Who's there?\" he asked, but without alarm, supposing it one of his\nfellows.\n\n\"It is I,\" softly answered Peter Blood in the fluent Castillan of which\nhe was master.\n\n\"Is it you, Pedro?\" The Spaniard came a step nearer.\n\n\"Peter is my name; but I doubt I'll not be the Peter you're expecting.\"\n\n\"How?\" quoth the sentry, checking.\n\n\"This way,\" said Mr. Blood.\n\nThe wooden taffrail was a low one, and the Spaniard was taken completely\nby surprise. Save for the splash he made as he struck the water,\nnarrowly missing one of the crowded boats that waited under the counter,\nnot a sound announced his misadventure. Armed as he was with corselet,\ncuissarts, and headpiece, he sank to trouble them no more.\n\n\"Whist!\" hissed Mr. Blood to his waiting rebels-convict. \"Come on, now,\nand without noise.\"\n\nWithin five minutes they had swarmed aboard, the entire twenty of them\noverflowing from that narrow gallery and crouching on the quarter-deck\nitself. Lights showed ahead. Under the great lantern in the prow they\nsaw the black figure of the other sentry, pacing on the forecastle. From\nbelow sounds reached them of the orgy on the gun-deck: a rich male voice\nwas singing an obscene ballad to which the others chanted in chorus:\n\n\"Y estos son los usos de Castilla y de Leon!\"\n\n\"From what I've seen to-day I can well believe it,\" said Mr. Blood, and\nwhispered: \"Forward--after me.\"\n\nCrouching low, they glided, noiseless as shadows, to the quarter-deck\nrail, and thence slipped without sound down into the waist. Two thirds\nof them were armed with muskets, some of which they had found in the\noverseer's house, and others supplied from the secret hoard that Mr.\nBlood had so laboriously assembled against the day of escape. The\nremainder were equipped with knives and cutlasses.\n\nIn the vessel's waist they hung awhile, until Mr. Blood had satisfied\nhimself that no other sentinel showed above decks but that inconvenient\nfellow in the prow. Their first attention must be for him. Mr. Blood,\nhimself, crept forward with two companions, leaving the others in the\ncharge of that Nathaniel Hagthorpe whose sometime commission in the\nKing's Navy gave him the best title to this office.\n\nMr. Blood's absence was brief. When he rejoined his comrades there was\nno watch above the Spaniards' decks.\n\nMeanwhile the revellers below continued to make merry at their ease\nin the conviction of complete security. The garrison of Barbados was\noverpowered and disarmed, and their companions were ashore in complete\npossession of the town, glutting themselves hideously upon the fruits\nof victory. What, then, was there to fear? Even when their quarters were\ninvaded and they found themselves surrounded by a score of wild,\nhairy, half-naked men, who--save that they appeared once to have been\nwhite--looked like a horde of savages, the Spaniards could not believe\ntheir eyes.\n\nWho could have dreamed that a handful of forgotten plantation-slaves\nwould have dared to take so much upon themselves?\n\nThe half-drunken Spaniards, their laughter suddenly quenched, the song\nperishing on their lips, stared, stricken and bewildered at the levelled\nmuskets by which they were checkmated.\n\nAnd then, from out of this uncouth pack of savages that beset them,\nstepped a slim, tall fellow with light-blue eyes in a tawny face, eyes\nin which glinted the light of a wicked humour. He addressed them in the\npurest Castilian.\n\n\"You will save yourselves pain and trouble by regarding yourselves my\nprisoners, and suffering yourselves to be quietly bestowed out of harm's\nway.\"\n\n\"Name of God!\" swore the gunner, which did no justice at all to an\namazement beyond expression.\n\n\"If you please,\" said Mr. Blood, and thereupon those gentlemen of Spain\nwere induced without further trouble beyond a musket prod or two to drop\nthrough a scuttle to the deck below.\n\nAfter that the rebels-convict refreshed themselves with the good things\nin the consumption of which they had interrupted the Spaniards. To taste\npalatable Christian food after months of salt fish and maize dumplings\nwas in itself a feast to these unfortunates. But there were no excesses.\nMr. Blood saw to that, although it required all the firmness of which he\nwas capable.\n\nDispositions were to be made without delay against that which must\nfollow before they could abandon themselves fully to the enjoyment of\ntheir victory. This, after all, was no more than a preliminary skirmish,\nalthough it was one that afforded them the key to the situation. It\nremained to dispose so that the utmost profit might be drawn from it.\nThose dispositions occupied some very considerable portion of the\nnight. But, at least, they were complete before the sun peeped over\nthe shoulder of Mount Hilibay to shed his light upon a day of some\nsurprises.\n\nIt was soon after sunrise that the rebel-convict who paced the\nquarter-deck in Spanish corselet and headpiece, a Spanish musket on his\nshoulder, announced the approach of a boat. It was Don Diego de Espinosa\ny Valdez coming aboard with four great treasure-chests, containing each\ntwenty-five thousand pieces of eight, the ransom delivered to him at\ndawn by Governor Steed. He was accompanied by his son, Don Esteban, and\nby six men who took the oars.\n\nAboard the frigate all was quiet and orderly as it should be. She\nrode at anchor, her larboard to the shore, and the main ladder on her\nstarboard side. Round to this came the boat with Don Diego and his\ntreasure. Mr. Blood had disposed effectively. It was not for nothing\nthat he had served under de Ruyter. The swings were waiting, and the\nwindlass manned. Below, a gun-crew held itself in readiness under the\ncommand of Ogle, who--as I have said--had been a gunner in the Royal\nNavy before he went in for politics and followed the fortunes of\nthe Duke of Monmouth. He was a sturdy, resolute fellow who inspired\nconfidence by the very confidence he displayed in himself.\n\nDon Diego mounted the ladder and stepped upon the deck, alone, and\nentirely unsuspicious. What should the poor man suspect?\n\nBefore he could even look round, and survey this guard drawn up to\nreceive him, a tap over the head with a capstan bar efficiently handled\nby Hagthorpe put him to sleep without the least fuss.\n\nHe was carried away to his cabin, whilst the treasure-chests, handled\nby the men he had left in the boat, were being hauled to the deck. That\nbeing satisfactorily accomplished, Don Esteban and the fellows who had\nmanned the boat came up the ladder, one by one, to be handled with the\nsame quiet efficiency. Peter Blood had a genius for these things, and\nalmost, I suspect, an eye for the dramatic. Dramatic, certainly, was the\nspectacle now offered to the survivors of the raid.\n\nWith Colonel Bishop at their head, and gout-ridden Governor Steed\nsitting on the ruins of a wall beside him, they glumly watched the\ndeparture of the eight boats containing the weary Spanish ruffians who\nhad glutted themselves with rapine, murder, and violences unspeakable.\n\nThey looked on, between relief at this departure of their remorseless\nenemies, and despair at the wild ravages which, temporarily at least,\nhad wrecked the prosperity and happiness of that little colony.\n\nThe boats pulled away from the shore, with their loads of laughing,\njeering Spaniards, who were still flinging taunts across the water at\ntheir surviving victims. They had come midway between the wharf and the\nship, when suddenly the air was shaken by the boom of a gun.\n\nA round shot struck the water within a fathom of the foremost boat,\nsending a shower of spray over its occupants. They paused at their oars,\nastounded into silence for a moment. Then speech burst from them like\nan explosion. Angrily voluble they anathematized this dangerous\ncarelessness on the part of their gunner, who should know better than\nto fire a salute from a cannon loaded with shot. They were still cursing\nhim when a second shot, better aimed than the first, came to crumple one\nof the boats into splinters, flinging its crew, dead and living, into\nthe water.\n\nBut if it silenced these, it gave tongue, still more angry, vehement,\nand bewildered to the crews of the other seven boats. From each the\nsuspended oars stood out poised over the water, whilst on their feet in\nthe excitement the Spaniards screamed oaths at the ship, begging Heaven\nand Hell to inform them what madman had been let loose among her guns.\n\nPlump into their middle came a third shot, smashing a second boat with\nfearful execution. Followed again a moment of awful silence, then among\nthose Spanish pirates all was gibbering and jabbering and splashing of\noars, as they attempted to pull in every direction at once. Some were\nfor going ashore, others for heading straight to the vessel and there\ndiscovering what might be amiss. That something was very gravely amiss\nthere could be no further doubt, particularly as whilst they discussed\nand fumed and cursed two more shots came over the water to account for\nyet a third of their boats.\n\nThe resolute Ogle was making excellent practice, and fully justifying\nhis claims to know something of gunnery. In their consternation the\nSpaniards had simplified his task by huddling their boats together.\n\nAfter the fourth shot, opinion was no longer divided amongst them. As\nwith one accord they went about, or attempted to do so, for before they\nhad accomplished it two more of their boats had been sunk.\n\nThe three boats that remained, without concerning themselves with their\nmore unfortunate fellows, who were struggling in the water, headed back\nfor the wharf at speed.\n\nIf the Spaniards understood nothing of all this, the forlorn islanders\nashore understood still less, until to help their wits they saw the flag\nof Spain come down from the mainmast of the Cinco Llagas, and the\nflag of England soar to its empty place. Even then some bewilderment\npersisted, and it was with fearful eyes that they observed the return\nof their enemies, who might vent upon them the ferocity aroused by these\nextraordinary events.\n\nOgle, however, continued to give proof that his knowledge of gunnery was\nnot of yesterday. After the fleeing Spaniards went his shots. The last\nof their boats flew into splinters as it touched the wharf, and its\nremains were buried under a shower of loosened masonry.\n\nThat was the end of this pirate crew, which not ten minutes ago had\nbeen laughingly counting up the pieces of eight that would fall to\nthe portion of each for his share in that act of villainy. Close upon\nthreescore survivors contrived to reach the shore. Whether they had\ncause for congratulation, I am unable to say in the absence of any\nrecords in which their fate may be traced. That lack of records is in\nitself eloquent. We know that they were made fast as they landed, and\nconsidering the offence they had given I am not disposed to doubt that\nthey had every reason to regret the survival.\n\nThe mystery of the succour that had come at the eleventh hour to\nwreak vengeance upon the Spaniards, and to preserve for the island the\nextortionate ransom of a hundred thousand pieces of eight, remained yet\nto be probed. That the Cinco Llagas was now in friendly hands could no\nlonger be doubted after the proofs it had given. But who, the people\nof Bridgetown asked one another, were the men in possession of her, and\nwhence had they come? The only possible assumption ran the truth very\nclosely. A resolute party of islanders must have got aboard during\nthe night, and seized the ship. It remained to ascertain the precise\nidentity of these mysterious saviours, and do them fitting honour.\n\nUpon this errand--Governor Steed's condition not permitting him to go\nin person--went Colonel Bishop as the Governor's deputy, attended by two\nofficers.\n\nAs he stepped from the ladder into the vessel's waist, the Colonel\nbeheld there, beside the main hatch, the four treasure-chests, the\ncontents of one of which had been contributed almost entirely by\nhimself. It was a gladsome spectacle, and his eyes sparkled in beholding\nit.\n\nRanged on either side, athwart the deck, stood a score of men in two\nwell-ordered files, with breasts and backs of steel, polished Spanish\nmorions on their heads, overshadowing their faces, and muskets ordered\nat their sides.\n\nColonel Bishop could not be expected to recognize at a glance in these\nupright, furbished, soldierly figures the ragged, unkempt scarecrows\nthat but yesterday had been toiling in his plantations. Still less could\nhe be expected to recognize at once the courtly gentleman who advanced\nto greet him--a lean, graceful gentleman, dressed in the Spanish\nfashion, all in black with silver lace, a gold-hilted sword dangling\nbeside him from a gold embroidered baldrick, a broad castor with a\nsweeping plume set above carefully curled ringlets of deepest black.\n\n\"Be welcome aboard the Cinco Llagas, Colonel, darling,\" a voice vaguely\nfamiliar addressed the planter. \"We've made the best of the Spaniards'\nwardrobe in honour of this visit, though it was scarcely yourself we had\ndared hope to expect. You find yourself among friends--old friends of\nyours, all.\" The Colonel stared in stupefaction. Mr. Blood tricked out\nin all this splendour--indulging therein his natural taste--his face\ncarefully shaven, his hair as carefully dressed, seemed transformed into\na younger man. The fact is he looked no more than the thirty-three years\nhe counted to his age.\n\n\"Peter Blood!\" It was an ejaculation of amazement. Satisfaction followed\nswiftly. \"Was it you, then...?\"\n\n\"Myself it was--myself and these, my good friends and yours.\" Mr. Blood\ntossed back the fine lace from his wrist, to wave a hand towards the\nfile of men standing to attention there.\n\nThe Colonel looked more closely. \"Gad's my life!\" he crowed on a note\nof foolish jubilation. \"And it was with these fellows that you took\nthe Spaniard and turned the tables on those dogs! Oddswounds! It was\nheroic!\"\n\n\"Heroic, is it? Bedad, it's epic! Ye begin to perceive the breadth and\ndepth of my genius.\"\n\nColonel Bishop sat himself down on the hatch-coaming, took off his broad\nhat, and mopped his brow.\n\n\"Y'amaze me!\" he gasped. \"On my soul, y'amaze me! To have recovered the\ntreasure and to have seized this fine ship and all she'll hold! It will\nbe something to set against the other losses we have suffered. As Gad's\nmy life, you deserve well for this.\"\n\n\"I am entirely of your opinion.\"\n\n\"Damme! You all deserve well, and damme, you shall find me grateful.\"\n\n\"That's as it should be,\" said Mr. Blood. \"The question is how well we\ndeserve, and how grateful shall we find you?\"\n\nColonel Bishop considered him. There was a shadow of surprise in his\nface.\n\n\"Why--his excellency shall write home an account of your exploit, and\nmaybe some portion of your sentences shall be remitted.\"\n\n\"The generosity of King James is well known,\" sneered Nathaniel\nHagthorpe, who was standing by, and amongst the ranged rebels-convict\nsome one ventured to laugh.\n\nColonel Bishop started up. He was pervaded by the first pang of\nuneasiness. It occurred to him that all here might not be as friendly as\nappeared.\n\n\"And there's another matter,\" Mr. Blood resumed. \"There's a matter of\na flogging that's due to me. Ye're a man of your word in such matters,\nColonel--if not perhaps in others--and ye said, I think, that ye'd not\nleave a square inch of skin on my back.\"\n\nThe planter waved the matter aside. Almost it seemed to offend him.\n\n\"Tush! Tush! After this splendid deed of yours, do you suppose I can be\nthinking of such things?\"\n\n\"I'm glad ye feel like that about it. But I'm thinking it's mighty lucky\nfor me the Spaniards didn't come to-day instead of yesterday, or it's\nin the same plight as Jeremy Pitt I'd be this minute. And in that case\nwhere was the genius that would have turned the tables on these rascally\nSpaniards?\"\n\n\"Why speak of it now?\"\n\nMr. Blood resumed: \"ye'll please to understand that I must, Colonel,\ndarling. Ye've worked a deal of wickedness and cruelty in your time, and\nI want this to be a lesson to you, a lesson that ye'll remember--for\nthe sake of others who may come after us. There's Jeremy up there in the\nround-house with a back that's every colour of the rainbow; and the poor\nlad'll not be himself again for a month. And if it hadn't been for the\nSpaniards maybe it's dead he'd be by now, and maybe myself with him.\"\n\nHagthorpe lounged forward. He was a fairly tall, vigorous man with a\nclear-cut, attractive face which in itself announced his breeding.\n\n\"Why will you be wasting words on the hog?\" wondered that sometime\nofficer in the Royal Navy. \"Fling him overboard and have done with him.\"\n\nThe Colonel's eyes bulged in his head. \"What the devil do you mean?\" he\nblustered.\n\n\"It's the lucky man ye are entirely, Colonel, though ye don't guess the\nsource of your good fortune.\"\n\nAnd now another intervened--the brawny, one-eyed Wolverstone, less\nmercifully disposed than his more gentlemanly fellow-convict.\n\n\"String him up from the yardarm,\" he cried, his deep voice harsh and\nangry, and more than one of the slaves standing to their arms made echo.\n\nColonel Bishop trembled. Mr. Blood turned. He was quite calm.\n\n\"If you please, Wolverstone,\" said he, \"I conduct affairs in my own way.\nThat is the pact. You'll please to remember it.\" His eyes looked along\nthe ranks, making it plain that he addressed them all. \"I desire that\nColonel Bishop should have his life. One reason is that I require him as\na hostage. If ye insist on hanging him, ye'll have to hang me with him,\nor in the alternative I'll go ashore.\"\n\nHe paused. There was no answer. But they stood hang-dog and\nhalf-mutinous before him, save Hagthorpe, who shrugged and smiled\nwearily.\n\nMr. Blood resumed: \"Ye'll please to understand that aboard a ship there\nis one captain. So.\" He swung again to the startled Colonel. \"Though\nI promise you your life, I must--as you've heard--keep you aboard as a\nhostage for the good behaviour of Governor Steed and what's left of the\nfort until we put to sea.\"\n\n\"Until you...\" Horror prevented Colonel Bishop from echoing the\nremainder of that incredible speech.\n\n\"Just so,\" said Peter Blood, and he turned to the officers who had\naccompanied the Colonel. \"The boat is waiting, gentlemen. You'll have\nheard what I said. Convey it with my compliments to his excellency.\"\n\n\"But, sir...\" one of them began.\n\n\"There is no more to be said, gentlemen. My name is Blood--Captain\nBlood, if you please, of this ship the Cinco Llagas, taken as a prize of\nwar from Don Diego de Espinosa y Valdez, who is my prisoner aboard.\nYou are to understand that I have turned the tables on more than the\nSpaniards. There's the ladder. You'll find it more convenient than being\nheaved over the side, which is what'll happen if you linger.\"\n\nThey went, though not without some hustling, regardless of the\nbellowings of Colonel Bishop, whose monstrous rage was fanned by terror\nat finding himself at the mercy of these men of whose cause to hate him\nhe was very fully conscious.\n\nA half-dozen of them, apart from Jeremy Pitt, who was utterly\nincapacitated for the present, possessed a superficial knowledge\nof seamanship. Hagthorpe, although he had been a fighting officer,\nuntrained in navigation, knew how to handle a ship, and under his\ndirections they set about getting under way.\n\nThe anchor catted, and the mainsail unfurled, they stood out for the\nopen before a gentle breeze, without interference from the fort.\n\nAs they were running close to the headland east of the bay, Peter\nBlood returned to the Colonel, who, under guard and panic-stricken, had\ndejectedly resumed his seat on the coamings of the main batch.\n\n\"Can ye swim, Colonel?\"\n\nColonel Bishop looked up. His great face was yellow and seemed in that\nmoment of a preternatural flabbiness; his beady eyes were beadier than\never.\n\n\"As your doctor, now, I prescribe a swim to cool the excessive heat\nof your humours.\" Blood delivered the explanation pleasantly, and,\nreceiving still no answer from the Colonel, continued: \"It's a mercy for\nyou I'm not by nature as bloodthirsty as some of my friends here. And\nit's the devil's own labour I've had to prevail upon them not to be\nvindictive. I doubt if ye're worth the pains I've taken for you.\"\n\nHe was lying. He had no doubt at all. Had he followed his own wishes and\ninstincts, he would certainly have strung the Colonel up, and accounted\nit a meritorious deed. It was the thought of Arabella Bishop that had\nurged him to mercy, and had led him to oppose the natural vindictiveness\nof his fellow-slaves until he had been in danger of precipitating a\nmutiny. It was entirely to the fact that the Colonel was her uncle,\nalthough he did not even begin to suspect such a cause, that he owed\nsuch mercy as was now being shown him.\n\n\"You shall have a chance to swim for it,\" Peter Blood continued. \"It's\nnot above a quarter of a mile to the headland yonder, and with ordinary\nluck ye should manage it. Faith, you're fat enough to float. Come on!\nNow, don't be hesitating or it's a long voyage ye'll be going with us,\nand the devil knows what may happen to you. You're not loved any more\nthan you deserve.\"\n\nColonel Bishop mastered himself, and rose. A merciless despot, who had\nnever known the need for restraint in all these years, he was doomed by\nironic fate to practise restraint in the very moment when his feelings\nhad reached their most violent intensity.\n\nPeter Blood gave an order. A plank was run out over the gunwale, and\nlashed down.\n\n\"If you please, Colonel,\" said he, with a graceful flourish of\ninvitation.\n\nThe Colonel looked at him, and there was hell in his glance. Then,\ntaking his resolve, and putting the best face upon it, since no other\ncould help him here, he kicked off his shoes, peeled off his fine coat\nof biscuit-coloured taffetas, and climbed upon the plank.\n\nA moment he paused, steadied by a hand that clutched the ratlines,\nlooking down in terror at the green water rushing past some\nfive-and-twenty feet below.\n\n\"Just take a little walk, Colonel, darling,\" said a smooth, mocking\nvoice behind him.\n\nStill clinging, Colonel Bishop looked round in hesitation, and saw the\nbulwarks lined with swarthy faces--the faces of men that as lately as\nyesterday would have turned pale under his frown, faces that were now\nall wickedly agrin.\n\nFor a moment rage stamped out his fear. He cursed them aloud venomously\nand incoherently, then loosed his hold and stepped out upon the plank.\nThree steps he took before he lost his balance and went tumbling into\nthe green depths below.\n\nWhen he came to the surface again, gasping for air, the Cinco Llagas\nwas already some furlongs to leeward. But the roaring cheer of mocking\nvalediction from the rebels-convict reached him across the water, to\ndrive the iron of impotent rage deeper into his soul.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. DON DIEGO\n\n\nDon Diego de Espinosa y Valdez awoke, and with languid eyes in aching\nhead, he looked round the cabin, which was flooded with sunlight from\nthe square windows astern. Then he uttered a moan, and closed his eyes\nagain, impelled to this by the monstrous ache in his head. Lying thus,\nhe attempted to think, to locate himself in time and space. But between\nthe pain in his head and the confusion in his mind, he found coherent\nthought impossible.\n\nAn indefinite sense of alarm drove him to open his eyes again, and once\nmore to consider his surroundings.\n\nThere could be no doubt that he lay in the great cabin of his own\nship, the Cinco Llagas, so that his vague disquiet must be, surely,\nill-founded. And yet, stirrings of memory coming now to the assistance\nof reflection, compelled him uneasily to insist that here something was\nnot as it should be. The low position of the sun, flooding the cabin\nwith golden light from those square ports astern, suggested to him at\nfirst that it was early morning, on the assumption that the vessel was\nheaded westward. Then the alternative occurred to him. They might be\nsailing eastward, in which case the time of day would be late afternoon.\nThat they were sailing he could feel from the gentle forward heave of\nthe vessel under him. But how did they come to be sailing, and he, the\nmaster, not to know whether their course lay east or west, not to be\nable to recollect whither they were bound?\n\nHis mind went back over the adventure of yesterday, if of yesterday it\nwas. He was clear on the matter of the easily successful raid upon the\nIsland of Barbados; every detail stood vividly in his memory up to the\nmoment at which, returning aboard, he had stepped on to his own deck\nagain. There memory abruptly and inexplicably ceased.\n\nHe was beginning to torture his mind with conjecture, when the door\nopened, and to Don Diego's increasing mystification he beheld his best\nsuit of clothes step into the cabin. It was a singularly elegant and\ncharacteristically Spanish suit of black taffetas with silver lace that\nhad been made for him a year ago in Cadiz, and he knew each detail of it\nso well that it was impossible he could now be mistaken.\n\nThe suit paused to close the door, then advanced towards the couch on\nwhich Don Diego was extended, and inside the suit came a tall, slender\ngentleman of about Don Diego's own height and shape. Seeing the wide,\nstartled eyes of the Spaniard upon him, the gentleman lengthened his\nstride.\n\n\"Awake, eh?\" said he in Spanish.\n\nThe recumbent man looked up bewildered into a pair of light-blue eyes\nthat regarded him out of a tawny, sardonic face set in a cluster of\nblack ringlets. But he was too bewildered to make any answer.\n\nThe stranger's fingers touched the top of Don Diego's head, whereupon\nDon Diego winced and cried out in pain.\n\n\"Tender, eh?\" said the stranger. He took Don Diego's wrist between thumb\nand second finger. And then, at last, the intrigued Spaniard spoke.\n\n\"Are you a doctor?\"\n\n\"Among other things.\" The swarthy gentleman continued his study of the\npatient's pulse. \"Firm and regular,\" he announced at last, and dropped\nthe wrist. \"You've taken no great harm.\"\n\nDon Diego struggled up into a sitting position on the red velvet couch.\n\n\"Who the devil are you?\" he asked. \"And what the devil are you doing in\nmy clothes and aboard my ship?\"\n\nThe level black eyebrows went up, a faint smile curled the lips of the\nlong mouth.\n\n\"You are still delirious, I fear. This is not your ship. This is my\nship, and these are my clothes.\"\n\n\"Your ship?\" quoth the other, aghast, and still more aghast he added:\n\"Your clothes? But... then....\" Wildly his eyes looked about him. They\nscanned the cabin once again, scrutinizing each familiar object. \"Am I\nmad?\" he asked at last. \"Surely this ship is the Cinco Llagas?\"\n\n\"The Cinco Llagas it is.\"\n\n\"Then....\" The Spaniard broke off. His glance grew still more troubled.\n\"Valga me Dios!\" he cried out, like a man in anguish. \"Will you tell me\nalso that you are Don Diego de Espinosa?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, my name is Blood--Captain Peter Blood. This ship, like this\nhandsome suit of clothes, is mine by right of conquest. Just as you, Don\nDiego, are my prisoner.\"\n\nStartling as was the explanation, yet it proved soothing to Don Diego,\nbeing so much less startling than the things he was beginning to\nimagine.\n\n\"But... Are you not Spanish, then?\"\n\n\"You flatter my Castilian accent. I have the honour to be Irish. You\nwere thinking that a miracle had happened. So it has--a miracle wrought\nby my genius, which is considerable.\"\n\nSuccinctly now Captain Blood dispelled the mystery by a relation of\nthe facts. It was a narrative that painted red and white by turns the\nSpaniard's countenance. He put a hand to the back of his head, and there\ndiscovered, in confirmation of the story, a lump as large as a pigeon's\negg. Lastly, he stared wild-eyed at the sardonic Captain Blood.\n\n\"And my son? What of my son?\" he cried out. \"He was in the boat that\nbrought me aboard.\"\n\n\"Your son is safe; he and the boat's crew together with your gunner and\nhis men are snugly in irons under hatches.\"\n\nDon Diego sank back on the couch, his glittering dark eyes fixed upon\nthe tawny face above him. He composed himself. After all, he possessed\nthe stoicism proper to his desperate trade. The dice had fallen against\nhim in this venture. The tables had been turned upon him in the very\nmoment of success. He accepted the situation with the fortitude of a\nfatalist.\n\nWith the utmost calm he enquired:\n\n\"And now, Senior Capitan?\"\n\n\"And now,\" said Captain Blood--to give him the title he had\nassumed--\"being a humane man, I am sorry to find that ye're not dead\nfrom the tap we gave you. For it means that you'll be put to the trouble\nof dying all over again.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Don Diego drew a deep breath. \"But is that necessary?\" he asked,\nwithout apparent perturbation.\n\nCaptain Blood's blue eyes approved his bearing. \"Ask yourself,\" said he.\n\"Tell me, as an experienced and bloody pirate, what in my place would\nyou do, yourself?\"\n\n\"Ah, but there is a difference.\" Don Diego sat up to argue the matter.\n\"It lies in the fact that you boast yourself a humane man.\"\n\nCaptain Blood perched himself on the edge of the long oak table. \"But\nI am not a fool,\" said he, \"and I'll not allow a natural Irish\nsentimentality to stand in the way of my doing what is necessary and\nproper. You and your ten surviving scoundrels are a menace on this ship.\nMore than that, she is none so well found in water and provisions. True,\nwe are fortunately a small number, but you and your party inconveniently\nincrease it. So that on every hand, you see, prudence suggests to\nus that we should deny ourselves the pleasure of your company, and,\nsteeling our soft hearts to the inevitable, invite you to be so obliging\nas to step over the side.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said the Spaniard pensively. He swung his legs from the couch,\nand sat now upon the edge of it, his elbows on his knees. He had taken\nthe measure of his man, and met him with a mock-urbanity and a suave\ndetachment that matched his own. \"I confess,\" he admitted, \"that there\nis much force in what you say.\"\n\n\"You take a load from my mind,\" said Captain Blood. \"I would not appear\nunnecessarily harsh, especially since I and my friends owe you so very\nmuch. For, whatever it may have been to others, to us your raid upon\nBarbados was most opportune. I am glad, therefore, that you agree the I\nhave no choice.\"\n\n\"But, my friend, I did not agree so much.\"\n\n\"If there is any alternative that you can suggest, I shall be most happy\nto consider it.\"\n\nDon Diego stroked his pointed black beard.\n\n\"Can you give me until morning for reflection? My head aches so damnably\nthat I am incapable of thought. And this, you will admit, is a matter\nthat asks serious thought.\"\n\nCaptain Blood stood up. From a shelf he took a half-hour glass, reversed\nit so that the bulb containing the red sand was uppermost, and stood it\non the table.\n\n\"I am sorry to press you in such a matter, Don Diego, but one glass is\nall that I can give you. If by the time those sands have run out you can\npropose no acceptable alternative, I shall most reluctantly be driven to\nask you to go over the side with your friends.\"\n\nCaptain Blood bowed, went out, and locked the door. Elbows on his knees\nand face in his hands, Don Diego sat watching the rusty sands as they\nfiltered from the upper to the lower bulb. And what time he watched, the\nlines in his lean brown face grew deeper. Punctually as the last grains\nran out, the door reopened.\n\nThe Spaniard sighed, and sat upright to face the returning Captain Blood\nwith the answer for which he came.\n\n\"I have thought of an alternative, sir captain; but it depends upon\nyour charity. It is that you put us ashore on one of the islands of this\npestilent archipelago, and leave us to shift for ourselves.\"\n\nCaptain Blood pursed his lips. \"It has its difficulties,\" said he\nslowly.\n\n\"I feared it would be so.\" Don Diego sighed again, and stood up. \"Let us\nsay no more.\"\n\nThe light-blue eyes played over him like points of steel.\n\n\"You are not afraid to die, Don Diego?\"\n\nThe Spaniard threw back his head, a frown between his eyes.\n\n\"The question is offensive, sir.\"\n\n\"Then let me put it in another way--perhaps more happily: You do not\ndesire to live?\"\n\n\"Ah, that I can answer. I do desire to live; and even more do I desire\nthat my son may live. But the desire shall not make a coward of me for\nyour amusement, master mocker.\" It was the first sign he had shown of\nthe least heat or resentment.\n\nCaptain Blood did not directly answer. As before he perched himself on\nthe corner of the table.\n\n\"Would you be willing, sir, to earn life and liberty--for yourself, your\nson, and the other Spaniards who are on board?\"\n\n\"To earn it?\" said Don Diego, and the watchful blue eyes did not miss\nthe quiver that ran through him. \"To earn it, do you say? Why, if the\nservice you would propose is one that cannot hurt my honour....\"\n\n\"Could I be guilty of that?\" protested the Captain. \"I realize that even\na pirate has his honour.\" And forthwith he propounded his offer. \"If you\nwill look from those windows, Don Diego, you will see what appears to be\na cloud on the horizon. That is the island of Barbados well astern. All\nday we have been sailing east before the wind with but one intent--to\nset as great a distance between Barbados and ourselves as possible. But\nnow, almost out of sight of land, we are in a difficulty. The only man\namong us schooled in the art of navigation is fevered, delirious, in\nfact, as a result of certain ill-treatment he received ashore before we\ncarried him away with us. I can handle a ship in action, and there are\none or two men aboard who can assist me; but of the higher mysteries of\nseamanship and of the art of finding a way over the trackless wastes of\nocean, we know nothing. To hug the land, and go blundering about\nwhat you so aptly call this pestilent archipelago, is for us to court\ndisaster, as you can perhaps conceive. And so it comes to this: We\ndesire to make for the Dutch settlement of Curacao as straightly as\npossible. Will you pledge me your honour, if I release you upon parole,\nthat you will navigate us thither? If so, we will release you and your\nsurviving men upon arrival there.\"\n\nDon Diego bowed his head upon his breast, and strode away in thought to\nthe stern windows. There he stood looking out upon the sunlit sea and\nthe dead water in the great ship's wake--his ship, which these English\ndogs had wrested from him; his ship, which he was asked to bring safely\ninto a port where she would be completely lost to him and refitted\nperhaps to make war upon his kin. That was in one scale; in the other\nwere the lives of sixteen men. Fourteen of them mattered little to him,\nbut the remaining two were his own and his son's.\n\nHe turned at length, and his back being to the light, the Captain could\nnot see how pale his face had grown.\n\n\"I accept,\" he said.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. FILIAL PIETY\n\n\nBy virtue of the pledge he had given, Don Diego de Espinosa enjoyed the\nfreedom of the ship that had been his, and the navigation which he had\nundertaken was left entirely in his hands. And because those who manned\nher were new to the seas of the Spanish Main, and because even the\nthings that had happened in Bridgetown were not enough to teach them to\nregard every Spaniard as a treacherous, cruel dog to be slain at sight,\nthey used him with the civility which his own suave urbanity invited.\nHe took his meals in the great cabin with Blood and the three officers\nelected to support him: Hagthorpe, Wolverstone, and Dyke.\n\nThey found Don Diego an agreeable, even an amusing companion, and their\nfriendly feeling towards him was fostered by his fortitude and brave\nequanimity in this adversity.\n\nThat Don Diego was not playing fair it was impossible to suspect.\nMoreover, there was no conceivable reason why he should not. And he had\nbeen of the utmost frankness with them. He had denounced their mistake\nin sailing before the wind upon leaving Barbados. They should have left\nthe island to leeward, heading into the Caribbean and away from the\narchipelago. As it was, they would now be forced to pass through this\narchipelago again so as to make Curacao, and this passage was not to be\naccomplished without some measure of risk to themselves. At any point\nbetween the islands they might come upon an equal or superior craft;\nwhether she were Spanish or English would be equally bad for them, and\nbeing undermanned they were in no case to fight. To lessen this risk\nas far as possible, Don Diego directed at first a southerly and then\na westerly course; and so, taking a line midway between the islands of\nTobago and Grenada, they won safely through the danger-zone and came\ninto the comparative security of the Caribbean Sea.\n\n\"If this wind holds,\" he told them that night at supper, after he had\nannounced to them their position, \"we should reach Curacao inside three\ndays.\"\n\nFor three days the wind held, indeed it freshened a little on the\nsecond, and yet when the third night descended upon them they had still\nmade no landfall. The Cinco Llagas was ploughing through a sea contained\non every side by the blue bowl of heaven. Captain Blood uneasily\nmentioned it to Don Diego.\n\n\"It will be for to-morrow morning,\" he was answered with calm\nconviction.\n\n\"By all the saints, it is always 'to-morrow morning' with you Spaniards;\nand to-morrow never comes, my friend.\"\n\n\"But this to-morrow is coming, rest assured. However early you may be\nastir, you shall see land ahead, Don Pedro.\"\n\nCaptain Blood passed on, content, and went to visit Jerry Pitt, his\npatient, to whose condition Don Diego owed his chance of life. For\ntwenty-four hours now the fever had left the sufferer, and under\nPeter Blood's dressings, his lacerated back was beginning to heal\nsatisfactorily. So far, indeed, was he recovered that he complained of\nhis confinement, of the heat in his cabin. To indulge him Captain Blood\nconsented that he should take the air on deck, and so, as the last of\nthe daylight was fading from the sky, Jeremy Pitt came forth upon the\nCaptain's arm.\n\nSeated on the hatch-coamings, the Somersetshire lad gratefully filled\nhis lungs with the cool night air, and professed himself revived\nthereby. Then with the seaman's instinct his eyes wandered to the\ndarkling vault of heaven, spangled already with a myriad golden points\nof light. Awhile he scanned it idly, vacantly; then, his attention\nbecame sharply fixed. He looked round and up at Captain Blood, who stood\nbeside him.\n\n\"D'ye know anything of astronomy, Peter?\" quoth he.\n\n\"Astronomy, is it? Faith, now, I couldn't tell the Belt of Orion from\nthe Girdle of Venus.\"\n\n\"Ah! And I suppose all the others of this lubberly crew share your\nignorance.\"\n\n\"It would be more amiable of you to suppose that they exceed it.\"\n\nJeremy pointed ahead to a spot of light in the heavens over the\nstarboard bow. \"That is the North Star,\" said he.\n\n\"Is it now? Glory be, I wonder ye can pick it out from the rest.\"\n\n\"And the North Star ahead almost over your starboard bow means that\nwe're steering a course, north, northwest, or maybe north by west, for I\ndoubt if we are standing more than ten degrees westward.\"\n\n\"And why shouldn't we?\" wondered Captain Blood.\n\n\"You told me--didn't you?--that we came west of the archipelago between\nTobago and Grenada, steering for Curacao. If that were our present\ncourse, we should have the North Star abeam, out yonder.\"\n\nOn the instant Mr. Blood shed his laziness. He stiffened with\napprehension, and was about to speak when a shaft of light clove the\ngloom above their heads, coming from the door of the poop cabin which\nhad just been opened. It closed again, and presently there was a step\non the companion. Don Diego was approaching. Captain Blood's fingers\npressed Jerry's shoulder with significance. Then he called the Don,\nand spoke to him in English as had become his custom when others were\npresent.\n\n\"Will ye settle a slight dispute for us, Don Diego?\" said he lightly.\n\"We are arguing, Mr. Pitt and I, as to which is the North Star.\"\n\n\"So?\" The Spaniard's tone was easy; there was almost a suggestion that\nlaughter lurked behind it, and the reason for this was yielded by his\nnext sentence. \"But you tell me Mr. Pitt he is your navigant?\"\n\n\"For lack of a better,\" laughed the Captain, good-humouredly\ncontemptuous. \"Now I am ready to wager him a hundred pieces of eight\nthat that is the North Star.\" And he flung out an arm towards a point\nof light in the heavens straight abeam. He afterwards told Pitt that\nhad Don Diego confirmed him, he would have run him through upon that\ninstant. Far from that, however, the Spaniard freely expressed his\nscorn.\n\n\"You have the assurance that is of ignorance, Don Pedro; and you lose.\nThe North Star is this one.\" And he indicated it.\n\n\"You are sure?\"\n\n\"But my dear Don Pedro!\" The Spaniard's tone was one of amused protest.\n\"But is it possible that I mistake? Besides, is there not the compass?\nCome to the binnacle and see there what course we make.\"\n\nHis utter frankness, and the easy manner of one who has nothing to\nconceal resolved at once the doubt that had leapt so suddenly in the\nmind of Captain Blood. Pitt was satisfied less easily.\n\n\"In that case, Don Diego, will you tell me, since Curacao is our\ndestination, why our course is what it is?\"\n\nAgain there was no faintest hesitation on Don Diego's part. \"You have\nreason to ask,\" said he, and sighed. \"I had hope' it would not be\nobserve'. I have been careless--oh, of a carelessness very culpable. I\nneglect observation. Always it is my way. I make too sure. I count too\nmuch on dead reckoning. And so to-day I find when at last I take out\nthe quadrant that we do come by a half-degree too much south, so that\nCuracao is now almost due north. That is what cause the delay. But we\nwill be there to-morrow.\"\n\nThe explanation, so completely satisfactory, and so readily and candidly\nforthcoming, left no room for further doubt that Don Diego should have\nbeen false to his parole. And when presently Don Diego had withdrawn\nagain, Captain Blood confessed to Pitt that it was absurd to have\nsuspected him. Whatever his antecedents, he had proved his quality when\nhe announced himself ready to die sooner than enter into any undertaking\nthat could hurt his honour or his country.\n\nNew to the seas of the Spanish Main and to the ways of the adventurers\nwho sailed it, Captain Blood still entertained illusions. But the next\ndawn was to shatter them rudely and for ever.\n\nComing on deck before the sun was up, he saw land ahead, as the Spaniard\nhad promised them last night. Some ten miles ahead it lay, a long\ncoast-line filling the horizon east and west, with a massive headland\njutting forward straight before them. Staring at it, he frowned. He had\nnot conceived that Curacao was of such considerable dimensions. Indeed,\nthis looked less like an island than the main itself.\n\nBeating out aweather, against the gentle landward breeze he beheld a\ngreat ship on their starboard bow, that he conceived to be some three or\nfour miles off, and--as well as he could judge her at that distance--of\na tonnage equal if not superior to their own. Even as he watched her\nshe altered her course, and going about came heading towards them,\nclose-hauled.\n\nA dozen of his fellows were astir on the forecastle, looking eagerly\nahead, and the sound of their voices and laughter reached him across the\nlength of the stately Cinco Llagas.\n\n\"There,\" said a soft voice behind him in liquid Spanish, \"is the\nPromised Land, Don Pedro.\"\n\nIt was something in that voice, a muffled note of exultation, that\nawoke suspicion in him, and made whole the half-doubt he had been\nentertaining. He turned sharply to face Don Diego, so sharply that the\nsly smile was not effaced from the Spaniard's countenance before Captain\nBlood's eyes had flashed upon it.\n\n\"You find an odd satisfaction in the sight of it--all things\nconsidered,\" said Mr. Blood.\n\n\"Of course.\" The Spaniard rubbed his hands, and Mr. Blood observed that\nthey were unsteady. \"The satisfaction of a mariner.\"\n\n\"Or of a traitor--which?\" Blood asked him quietly. And as the Spaniard\nfell back before him with suddenly altered countenance that confirmed\nhis every suspicion, he flung an arm out in the direction of the distant\nshore. \"What land is that?\" he demanded. \"Will you have the effrontery\nto tell me that is the coast of Curacao?\"\n\nHe advanced upon Don Diego suddenly, and Don Diego, step by step, fell\nback. \"Shall I tell you what land it is? Shall I?\" His fierce assumption\nof knowledge seemed to dazzle and daze the Spaniard. For still Don Diego\nmade no answer. And then Captain Blood drew a bow at a venture--or\nnot quite at a venture. Such a coast-line as that, if not of the main\nitself, and the main he knew it could not be, must belong to either Cuba\nor Hispaniola. Now knowing Cuba to lie farther north and west of the\ntwo, it followed, he reasoned swiftly, that if Don Diego meant betrayal\nhe would steer for the nearer of these Spanish territories. \"That land,\nyou treacherous, forsworn Spanish dog, is the island of Hispaniola.\"\n\nHaving said it, he closely watched the swarthy face now overspread with\npallor, to see the truth or falsehood of his guess reflected there. But\nnow the retreating Spaniard had come to the middle of the quarter-deck,\nwhere the mizzen sail made a screen to shut them off from the eyes of\nthe Englishmen below. His lips writhed in a snarling smile.\n\n\"Ah, perro ingles! You know too much,\" he said under his breath, and\nsprang for the Captain's throat.\n\nTight-locked in each other's arms, they swayed a moment, then together\nwent down upon the deck, the Spaniard's feet jerked from under him\nby the right leg of Captain Blood. The Spaniard had depended upon his\nstrength, which was considerable. But it proved no match for the\nsteady muscles of the Irishman, tempered of late by the vicissitudes\nof slavery. He had depended upon choking the life out of Blood, and so\ngaining the half-hour that might be necessary to bring up that fine\nship that was beating towards them--a Spanish ship, perforce, since\nnone other would be so boldly cruising in these Spanish waters off\nHispaniola. But all that Don Diego had accomplished was to betray\nhimself completely, and to no purpose. This he realized when he found\nhimself upon his back, pinned down by Blood, who was kneeling on his\nchest, whilst the men summoned by their Captain's shout came clattering\nup the companion.\n\n\"Will I say a prayer for your dirty soul now, whilst I am in this\nposition?\" Captain Blood was furiously mocking him.\n\nBut the Spaniard, though defeated, now beyond hope for himself, forced\nhis lips to smile, and gave back mockery for mockery.\n\n\"Who will pray for your soul, I wonder, when that galleon comes to lie\nboard and board with you?\"\n\n\"That galleon!\" echoed Captain Blood with sudden and awful realization\nthat already it was too late to avoid the consequences of Don Diego's\nbetrayal of them.\n\n\"That galleon,\" Don Diego repeated, and added with a deepening sneer:\n\"Do you know what ship it is? I will tell you. It is the Encarnacion,\nthe flagship of Don Miguel de Espinosa, the Lord Admiral of Castile,\nand Don Miguel is my brother. It is a very fortunate encounter. The\nAlmighty, you see, watches over the destinies of Catholic Spain.\"\n\nThere was no trace of humour or urbanity now in Captain Blood. His light\neyes blazed: his face was set.\n\nHe rose, relinquishing the Spaniard to his men. \"Make him fast,\" he bade\nthem. \"Truss him, wrist and heel, but don't hurt him--not so much as a\nhair of his precious head.\"\n\nThe injunction was very necessary. Frenzied by the thought that they\nwere likely to exchange the slavery from which they had so lately\nescaped for a slavery still worse, they would have torn the Spaniard\nlimb from limb upon the spot. And if they now obeyed their Captain\nand refrained, it was only because the sudden steely note in his voice\npromised for Don Diego Valdez something far more exquisite than death.\n\n\"You scum! You dirty pirate! You man of honour!\" Captain Blood\napostrophized his prisoner.\n\nBut Don Diego looked up at him and laughed.\n\n\"You underrated me.\" He spoke English, so that all might hear. \"I tell\nyou that I was not fear death, and I show you that I was not fear it.\nYou no understand. You just an English dog.\"\n\n\"Irish, if you please,\" Captain Blood corrected him. \"And your parole,\nyou tyke of Spain?\"\n\n\"You think I give my parole to leave you sons of filth with this\nbeautiful Spanish ship, to go make war upon other Spaniards! Ha!\" Don\nDiego laughed in his throat. \"You fool! You can kill me. Pish! It is\nvery well. I die with my work well done. In less than an hour you will\nbe the prisoners of Spain, and the Cinco Llagas will go belong to Spain\nagain.\"\n\nCaptain Blood regarded him steadily out of a face which, if impassive,\nhad paled under its deep tan. About the prisoner, clamant, infuriated,\nferocious, the rebels-convict surged, almost literally \"athirst for his\nblood.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" Captain Blood imperiously commanded, and turning on his heel, he\nwent aside to the rail. As he stood there deep in thought, he was joined\nby Hagthorpe, Wolverstone, and Ogle the gunner. In silence they stared\nwith him across the water at that other ship. She had veered a point\naway from the wind, and was running now on a line that must in the end\nconverge with that of the Cinco Llagas.\n\n\"In less than half-an-hour,\" said Blood presently, \"we shall have her\nathwart our hawse, sweeping our decks with her guns.\"\n\n\"We can fight,\" said the one-eyed giant with an oath.\n\n\"Fight!\" sneered Blood. \"Undermanned as we are, mustering a bare twenty\nmen, in what case are we to fight? No, there would be only one way. To\npersuade her that all is well aboard, that we are Spaniards, so that she\nmay leave us to continue on our course.\"\n\n\"And how is that possible?\" Hagthorpe asked.\n\n\"It isn't possible,\" said Blood. \"If it....\" And then he broke off,\nand stood musing, his eyes upon the green water. Ogle, with a bent for\nsarcasm, interposed a suggestion bitterly.\n\n\"We might send Don Diego de Espinosa in a boat manned by his Spaniards\nto assure his brother the Admiral that we are all loyal subjects of his\nCatholic Majesty.\"\n\nThe Captain swung round, and for an instant looked as if he would have\nstruck the gunner. Then his expression changed: the light of inspiration\nWas in his glance.\n\n\"Bedad! ye've said it. He doesn't fear death, this damned pirate; but\nhis son may take a different view. Filial piety's mighty strong in\nSpain.\" He swung on his heel abruptly, and strode back to the knot of\nmen about his prisoner. \"Here!\" he shouted to them. \"Bring him below.\"\nAnd he led the way down to the waist, and thence by the booby hatch to\nthe gloom of the 'tween-decks, where the air was rank with the smell\nof tar and spun yarn. Going aft he threw open the door of the spacious\nwardroom, and went in followed by a dozen of the hands with the pinioned\nSpaniard. Every man aboard would have followed him but for his sharp\ncommand to some of them to remain on deck with Hagthorpe.\n\nIn the ward-room the three stern chasers were in position, loaded,\ntheir muzzles thrusting through the open ports, precisely as the Spanish\ngunners had left them.\n\n\"Here, Ogle, is work for you,\" said Blood, and as the burly gunner came\nthrusting forward through the little throng of gaping men, Blood pointed\nto the middle chaser; \"Have that gun hauled back,\" he ordered.\n\nWhen this was done, Blood beckoned those who held Don Diego.\n\n\"Lash him across the mouth of it,\" he bade them, and whilst, assisted by\nanother two, they made haste to obey, he turned to the others. \"To the\nroundhouse, some of you, and fetch the Spanish prisoners. And you, Dyke,\ngo up and bid them set the flag of Spain aloft.\"\n\nDon Diego, with his body stretched in an arc across the cannon's mouth,\nlegs and arms lashed to the carriage on either side of it, eyeballs\nrolling in his head, glared maniacally at Captain Blood. A man may not\nfear to die, and yet be appalled by the form in which death comes to\nhim.\n\nFrom frothing lips he hurled blasphemies and insults at his tormentor.\n\n\"Foul barbarian! Inhuman savage! Accursed heretic! Will it not content\nyou to kill me in some Christian fashion?\" Captain Blood vouchsafed him\na malignant smile, before he turned to meet the fifteen manacled Spanish\nprisoners, who were thrust into his presence.\n\nApproaching, they had heard Don Diego's outcries; at close quarters now\nthey beheld with horror-stricken eyes his plight. From amongst them a\ncomely, olive-skinned stripling, distinguished in bearing and apparel\nfrom his companions, started forward with an anguished cry of \"Father!\"\n\nWrithing in the arms that made haste to seize and hold him, he called\nupon heaven and hell to avert this horror, and lastly, addressed to\nCaptain Blood an appeal for mercy that was at once fierce and piteous.\nConsidering him, Captain Blood thought with satisfaction that he\ndisplayed the proper degree of filial piety.\n\nHe afterwards confessed that for a moment he was in danger of weakening,\nthat for a moment his mind rebelled against the pitiless thing it had\nplanned. But to correct the sentiment he evoked a memory of what these\nSpaniards had performed in Bridgetown. Again he saw the white face of\nthat child Mary Traill as she fled in horror before the jeering ruffian\nwhom he had slain, and other things even more unspeakable seen on that\ndreadful evening rose now before the eyes of his memory to stiffen his\nfaltering purpose. The Spaniards had shown themselves without mercy\nor sentiment or decency of any kind; stuffed with religion, they were\nwithout a spark of that Christianity, the Symbol of which was mounted on\nthe mainmast of the approaching ship. A moment ago this cruel, vicious\nDon Diego had insulted the Almighty by his assumption that He kept a\nspecially benevolent watch over the destinies of Catholic Spain. Don\nDiego should be taught his error.\n\nRecovering the cynicism in which he had approached his task, the\ncynicism essential to its proper performance, he commanded Ogle to\nkindle a match and remove the leaden apron from the touch-hole of the\ngun that bore Don Diego. Then, as the younger Espinosa broke into fresh\nintercessions mingled with imprecations, he wheeled upon him sharply.\n\n\"Peace!\" he snapped. \"Peace, and listen! It is no part of my intention\nto blow your father to hell as he deserves, or indeed to take his life\nat all.\"\n\nHaving surprised the lad into silence by that promise--a promise\nsurprising enough in all the circumstances--he proceeded to explain his\naims in that faultless and elegant Castilian of which he was fortunately\nmaster--as fortunately for Don Diego as for himself.\n\n\"It is your father's treachery that has brought us into this plight and\ndeliberately into risk of capture and death aboard that ship of Spain.\nJust as your father recognized his brother's flagship, so will his\nbrother have recognized the Cinco Llagas. So far, then, all is well. But\npresently the Encarnacion will be sufficiently close to perceive that\nhere all is not as it should be. Sooner or later, she must guess or\ndiscover what is wrong, and then she will open fire or lay us board and\nboard. Now, we are in no case to fight, as your father knew when he ran\nus into this trap. But fight we will, if we are driven to it. We make no\ntame surrender to the ferocity of Spain.\"\n\nHe laid his hand on the breech of the gun that bore Don Diego.\n\n\"Understand this clearly: to the first shot from the Encarnacion this\ngun will fire the answer. I make myself clear, I hope?\"\n\nWhite-faced and trembling, young Espinosa stared into the pitiless blue\neyes that so steadily regarded him.\n\n\"If it is clear?\" he faltered, breaking the utter silence in which all\nwere standing. \"But, name of God, how should it be clear? How should\nI understand? Can you avert the fight? If you know a way, and if I, or\nthese, can help you to it--if that is what you mean--in Heaven's name\nlet me hear it.\"\n\n\"A fight would be averted if Don Diego de Espinosa were to go aboard his\nbrother's ship, and by his presence and assurances inform the Admiral\nthat all is well with the Cinco Llagas, that she is indeed still a ship\nof Spain as her flag now announces. But of course Don Diego cannot go\nin person, because he is... otherwise engaged. He has a slight touch of\nfever--shall we say?--that detains him in his cabin. But you, his son,\nmay convey all this and some other matters together with his homage\nto your uncle. You shall go in a boat manned by six of these Spanish\nprisoners, and I--a distinguished Spaniard delivered from captivity\nin Barbados by your recent raid--will accompany you to keep you in\ncountenance. If I return alive, and without accident of any kind to\nhinder our free sailing hence, Don Diego shall have his life, as shall\nevery one of you. But if there is the least misadventure, be it from\ntreachery or ill-fortune--I care not which--the battle, as I have had\nthe honour to explain, will be opened on our side by this gun, and your\nfather will be the first victim of the conflict.\"\n\nHe paused a moment. There was a hum of approval from his comrades,\nan anxious stirring among the Spanish prisoners. Young Espinosa stood\nbefore him, the colour ebbing and flowing in his cheeks. He waited for\nsome direction from his father. But none came. Don Diego's courage,\nit seemed, had sadly waned under that rude test. He hung limply in his\nfearful bonds, and was silent. Evidently he dared not encourage his son\nto defiance, and presumably was ashamed to urge him to yield. Thus, he\nleft decision entirely with the youth.\n\n\"Come,\" said Blood. \"I have been clear enough, I think. What do you\nsay?\"\n\nDon Esteban moistened his parched lips, and with the back of his hand\nmopped the anguish-sweat from his brow. His eyes gazed wildly a moment\nupon the shoulders of his father, as if beseeching guidance. But his\nfather remained silent. Something like a sob escaped the boy.\n\n\"I... I accept,\" he answered at last, and swung to the Spaniards. \"And\nyou--you will accept too,\" he insisted passionately. \"For Don Diego's\nsake and for your own--for all our sakes. If you do not, this man will\nbutcher us all without mercy.\"\n\nSince he yielded, and their leader himself counselled no resistance,\nwhy should they encompass their own destruction by a gesture of futile\nheroism? They answered without much hesitation that they would do as was\nrequired of them.\n\nBlood turned, and advanced to Don Diego.\n\n\"I am sorry to inconvenience you in this fashion, but...\" For a second\nhe checked and frowned as his eyes intently observed the prisoner. Then,\nafter that scarcely perceptible pause, he continued, \"but I do not think\nthat you have anything beyond this inconvenience to apprehend, and you\nmay depend upon me to shorten it as far as possible.\" Don Diego made him\nno answer.\n\nPeter Blood waited a moment, observing him; then he bowed and stepped\nback.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. DON PEDRO SANGRE\n\n\nThe Cinco Llagas and the Encarnacion, after a proper exchange of\nsignals, lay hove to within a quarter of a mile of each other, and\nacross the intervening space of gently heaving, sunlit waters sped a\nboat from the former, manned by six Spanish seamen and bearing in her\nstern sheets Don Esteban de Espinosa and Captain Peter Blood.\n\nShe also bore two treasure-chests containing fifty thousand pieces of\neight. Gold has at all times been considered the best of testimonies of\ngood faith, and Blood was determined that in all respects appearances\nshould be entirely on his side. His followers had accounted this\na supererogation of pretence. But Blood's will in the matter had\nprevailed. He carried further a bulky package addressed to a grande\nof Spain, heavily sealed with the arms of Espinosa--another piece of\nevidence hastily manufactured in the cabin of the Cinco Llagas--and he\nwas spending these last moments in completing his instructions to his\nyoung companion.\n\nDon Esteban expressed his last lingering uneasiness:\n\n\"But if you should betray yourself?\" he cried.\n\n\"It will be unfortunate for everybody. I advised your father to say a\nprayer for our success. I depend upon you to help me more materially.\"\n\n\"I will do my best. God knows I will do my best,\" the boy protested.\n\nBlood nodded thoughtfully, and no more was said until they bumped\nalongside the towering mass of the Encarnadon. Up the ladder went\nDon Esteban closely followed by Captain Blood. In the waist stood the\nAdmiral himself to receive them, a handsome, self-sufficient man,\nvery tall and stiff, a little older and greyer than Don Diego, whom he\nclosely resembled. He was supported by four officers and a friar in the\nblack and white habit of St. Dominic.\n\nDon Miguel opened his arms to his nephew, whose lingering panic he\nmistook for pleasurable excitement, and having enfolded him to his bosom\nturned to greet Don Esteban's companion.\n\nPeter Blood bowed gracefully, entirely at his ease, so far as might be\njudged from appearances.\n\n\"I am,\" he announced, making a literal translation of his name, \"Don\nPedro Sangre, an unfortunate gentleman of Leon, lately delivered from\ncaptivity by Don Esteban's most gallant father.\" And in a few words\nhe sketched the imagined conditions of his capture by, and deliverance\nfrom, those accursed heretics who held the island of Barbados.\n\"Benedicamus Domino,\" said the friar to his tale.\n\n\"Ex hoc nunc et usque in seculum,\" replied Blood, the occasional papist,\nwith lowered eyes.\n\nThe Admiral and his attending officers gave him a sympathetic hearing\nand a cordial welcome. Then came the dreaded question.\n\n\"But where is my brother? Why has he not come, himself, to greet me?\"\n\nIt was young Espinosa who answered this:\n\n\"My father is afflicted at denying himself that honour and pleasure. But\nunfortunately, sir uncle, he is a little indisposed--oh, nothing grave;\nmerely sufficient to make him keep his cabin. It is a little fever, the\nresult of a slight wound taken in the recent raid upon Barbados, which\nresulted in this gentleman's happy deliverance.\"\n\n\"Nay, nephew, nay,\" Don Miguel protested with ironic repudiation. \"I can\nhave no knowledge of these things. I have the honour to represent upon\nthe seas His Catholic Majesty, who is at peace with the King of England.\nAlready you have told me more than it is good for me to know. I will\nendeavour to forget it, and I will ask you, sirs,\" he added, glancing at\nhis officers, \"to forget it also.\" But he winked into the twinkling\neyes of Captain Blood; then added matter that at once extinguished that\ntwinkle. \"But since Diego cannot come to me, why, I will go across to\nhim.\"\n\nFor a moment Don Esteban's face was a mask of pallid fear. Then Blood\nwas speaking in a lowered, confidential voice that admirably blended\nsuavity, impressiveness, and sly mockery.\n\n\"If you please, Don Miguel, but that is the very thing you must not\ndo--the very thing Don Diego does not wish you to do. You must not see\nhim until his wounds are healed. That is his own wish. That is the real\nreason why he is not here. For the truth is that his wounds are not\nso grave as to have prevented his coming. It was his consideration of\nhimself and the false position in which you would be placed if you had\ndirect word from him of what has happened. As your excellency has said,\nthere is peace between His Catholic Majesty and the King of England, and\nyour brother Don Diego....\" He paused a moment. \"I am sure that I need\nsay no more. What you hear from us is no more than a mere rumour. Your\nexcellency understands.\"\n\nHis excellency frowned thoughtfully. \"I understand... in part,\" said he.\n\nCaptain Blood had a moment's uneasiness. Did the Spaniard doubt his bona\nfides? Yet in dress and speech he knew himself to be impeccably Spanish,\nand was not Don Esteban there to confirm him? He swept on to afford\nfurther confirmation before the Admiral could say another word.\n\n\"And we have in the boat below two chests containing fifty thousand\npieces of eight, which we are to deliver to your excellency.\"\n\nHis excellency jumped; there was a sudden stir among his officers.\n\n\"They are the ransom extracted by Don Diego from the Governor of....\"\n\n\"Not another word, in the name of Heaven!\" cried the Admiral in alarm.\n\"My brother wishes me to assume charge of this money, to carry it to\nSpain for him? Well, that is a family matter between my brother and\nmyself. So, it can be done. But I must not know....\" He broke off. \"Hum!\nA glass of Malaga in my cabin, if you please,\" he invited them, \"whilst\nthe chests are being hauled aboard.\"\n\nHe gave his orders touching the embarkation of these chests, then led\nthe way to his regally appointed cabin, his four officers and the friar\nfollowing by particular invitation.\n\nSeated at table there, with the tawny wine before them, and the servant\nwho had poured it withdrawn, Don Miguel laughed and stroked his pointed,\ngrizzled beard.\n\n\"Virgen santisima! That brother of mine has a mind that thinks of\neverything. Left to myself, I might have committed a fine indiscretion\nby venturing aboard his ship at such a moment. I might have seen things\nwhich as Admiral of Spain it would be difficult for me to ignore.\"\n\nBoth Esteban and Blood made haste to agree with him, and then Blood\nraised his glass, and drank to the glory of Spain and the damnation of\nthe besotted James who occupied the throne of England. The latter part\nof his toast was at least sincere.\n\nThe Admiral laughed.\n\n\"Sir, sir, you need my brother here to curb your imprudences. You should\nremember that His Catholic Majesty and the King of England are very good\nfriends. That is not a toast to propose in this cabin. But since it has\nbeen proposed, and by one who has such particular personal cause to hate\nthese English hounds, why, we will honour it--but unofficially.\"\n\nThey laughed, and drank the damnation of King James--quite unofficially,\nbut the more fervently on that account. Then Don Esteban, uneasy on the\nscore of his father, and remembering that the agony of Don Diego was\nbeing protracted with every moment that they left him in his dreadful\nposition, rose and announced that they must be returning.\n\n\"My father,\" he explained, \"is in haste to reach San Domingo. He desired\nme to stay no longer than necessary to embrace you. If you will give us\nleave, then, sir uncle.\"\n\nIn the circumstances \"sir uncle\" did not insist.\n\nAs they returned to the ship's side, Blood's eyes anxiously scanned the\nline of seamen leaning over the bulwarks in idle talk with the Spaniards\nin the cock-boat that waited at the ladder's foot. But their manner\nshowed him that there was no ground for his anxiety. The boat's crew had\nbeen wisely reticent.\n\nThe Admiral took leave of them--of Esteban affectionately, of Blood\nceremoniously.\n\n\"I regret to lose you so soon, Don Pedro. I wish that you could have\nmade a longer visit to the Encarnacion.\"\n\n\"I am indeed unfortunate,\" said Captain Blood politely.\n\n\"But I hope that we may meet again.\"\n\n\"That is to flatter me beyond all that I deserve.\"\n\nThey reached the boat; and she cast off from the great ship. As they\nwere pulling away, the Admiral waving to them from the taffrail,\nthey heard the shrill whistle of the bo'sun piping the hands to their\nstations, and before they had reached the Cinco Llagas, they beheld the\nEncarnacion go about under sail. She dipped her flag to them, and from\nher poop a gun fired a salute.\n\nAboard the Cinco Llagas some one--it proved afterwards to be\nHagthorpe--had the wit to reply in the same fashion. The comedy was\nended. Yet there was something else to follow as an epilogue, a thing\nthat added a grim ironic flavour to the whole.\n\nAs they stepped into the waist of the Cinco Llagas, Hagthorpe advanced\nto receive them. Blood observed the set, almost scared expression on his\nface.\n\n\"I see that you've found it,\" he said quietly.\n\nHagthorpe's eyes looked a question. But his mind dismissed whatever\nthought it held.\n\n\"Don Diego...\" he was beginning, and then stopped, and looked curiously\nat Blood.\n\nNoting the pause and the look, Esteban bounded forward, his face livid.\n\n\"Have you broken faith, you curs? Has he come to harm?\" he cried--and\nthe six Spaniards behind him grew clamorous with furious questionings.\n\n\"We do not break faith,\" said Hagthorpe firmly, so firmly that he\nquieted them. \"And in this case there was not the need. Don Diego died\nin his bonds before ever you reached the Encarnacion.\"\n\nPeter Blood said nothing.\n\n\"Died?\" screamed Esteban. \"You killed him, you mean. Of what did he\ndie?\"\n\nHagthorpe looked at the boy. \"If I am a judge,\" he said, \"Don Diego died\nof fear.\"\n\nDon Esteban struck Hagthorpe across the face at that, and Hagthorpe\nwould have struck back, but that Blood got between, whilst his followers\nseized the lad.\n\n\"Let be,\" said Blood. \"You provoked the boy by your insult to his\nfather.\"\n\n\"I was not concerned to insult,\" said Hagthorpe, nursing his cheek. \"It\nis what has happened. Come and look.\"\n\n\"I have seen,\" said Blood. \"He died before I left the Cinco Llagas. He\nwas hanging dead in his bonds when I spoke to him before leaving.\"\n\n\"What are you saying?\" cried Esteban.\n\nBlood looked at him gravely. Yet for all his gravity he seemed almost to\nsmile, though without mirth.\n\n\"If you had known that, eh?\" he asked at last. For a moment Don Esteban\nstared at him wide-eyed, incredulous. \"I don't believe you,\" he said at\nlast.\n\n\"Yet you may. I am a doctor, and I know death when I see it.\"\n\nAgain there came a pause, whilst conviction sank into the lad's mind.\n\n\"If I had known that,\" he said at last in a thick voice, \"you would be\nhanging from the yardarm of the Encarnacion at this moment.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Blood. \"I am considering it--the profit that a man may\nfind in the ignorance of others.\"\n\n\"But you'll hang there yet,\" the boy raved.\n\nCaptain Blood shrugged, and turned on his heel. But he did not on that\naccount disregard the words, nor did Hagthorpe, nor yet the others\nwho overheard them, as they showed at a council held that night in the\ncabin.\n\nThis council was met to determine what should be done with the Spanish\nprisoners. Considering that Curacao now lay beyond their reach, as\nthey were running short of water and provisions, and also that Pitt was\nhardly yet in case to undertake the navigation of the vessel, it had\nbeen decided that, going east of Hispaniola, and then sailing along\nits northern coast, they should make for Tortuga, that haven of the\nbuccaneers, in which lawless port they had at least no danger of\nrecapture to apprehend. It was now a question whether they should convey\nthe Spaniards thither with them, or turn them off in a boat to make the\nbest of their way to the coast of Hispaniola, which was but ten miles\noff. This was the course urged by Blood himself.\n\n\"There's nothing else to be done,\" he insisted. \"In Tortuga they would\nbe flayed alive.\"\n\n\"Which is less than the swine deserve,\" growled Wolverstone.\n\n\"And you'll remember, Peter,\" put in Hagthorpe, \"that boy's threat to\nyou this morning. If he escapes, and carries word of all this to his\nuncle, the Admiral, the execution of that threat will become more than\npossible.\"\n\nIt says much for Peter Blood that the argument should have left him\nunmoved. It is a little thing, perhaps, but in a narrative in which\nthere is so much that tells against him, I cannot--since my story is\nin the nature of a brief for the defence--afford to slur a circumstance\nthat is so strongly in his favour, a circumstance revealing that the\ncynicism attributed to him proceeded from his reason and from a brooding\nover wrongs rather than from any natural instincts. \"I care nothing for\nhis threats.\"\n\n\"You should,\" said Wolverstone. \"The wise thing'd be to hang him, along\no' all the rest.\"\n\n\"It is not human to be wise,\" said Blood. \"It is much more human to\nerr, though perhaps exceptional to err on the side of mercy. We'll be\nexceptional. Oh, faugh! I've no stomach for cold-blooded killing. At\ndaybreak pack the Spaniards into a boat with a keg of water and a sack\nof dumplings, and let them go to the devil.\"\n\nThat was his last word on the subject, and it prevailed by virtue of the\nauthority they had vested in him, and of which he had taken so firm a\ngrip. At daybreak Don Esteban and his followers were put off in a boat.\n\nTwo days later, the Cinco Llagas sailed into the rock-bound bay of\nCayona, which Nature seemed to have designed for the stronghold of those\nwho had appropriated it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. TORTUGA\n\n\nIt is time fully to disclose the fact that the survival of the story of\nCaptain Blood's exploits is due entirely to the industry of Jeremy Pitt,\nthe Somersetshire shipmaster. In addition to his ability as a navigator,\nthis amiable young man appears to have wielded an indefatigable pen, and\nto have been inspired to indulge its fluency by the affection he very\nobviously bore to Peter Blood.\n\nHe kept the log of the forty-gun frigate Arabella, on which he served as\nmaster, or, as we should say to-day, navigating officer, as no log\nthat I have seen was ever kept. It runs into some twenty-odd volumes of\nassorted sizes, some of which are missing altogether and others of which\nare so sadly depleted of leaves as to be of little use. But if at times\nin the laborious perusal of them--they are preserved in the library of\nMr. James Speke of Comerton--I have inveighed against these lacunae, at\nothers I have been equally troubled by the excessive prolixity of what\nremains and the difficulty of disintegrating from the confused whole the\nreally essential parts.\n\nI have a suspicion that Esquemeling--though how or where I can make no\nsurmise--must have obtained access to these records, and that he plucked\nfrom them the brilliant feathers of several exploits to stick them into\nthe tail of his own hero, Captain Morgan. But that is by the way. I\nmention it chiefly as a warning, for when presently I come to relate the\naffair of Maracaybo, those of you who have read Esquemeling may be in\ndanger of supposing that Henry Morgan really performed those things\nwhich here are veraciously attributed to Peter Blood. I think, however,\nthat when you come to weigh the motives actuating both Blood and the\nSpanish Admiral, in that affair, and when you consider how integrally\nthe event is a part of Blood's history--whilst merely a detached\nincident in Morgan's--you will reach my own conclusion as to which is\nthe real plagiarist.\n\nThe first of these logs of Pitt's is taken up almost entirely with a\nretrospective narrative of the events up to the time of Blood's first\ncoming to Tortuga. This and the Tannatt Collection of State Trials are\nthe chief--though not the only--sources of my history so far.\n\nPitt lays great stress upon the fact that it was the circumstances upon\nwhich I have dwelt, and these alone, that drove Peter Blood to seek\nan anchorage at Tortuga. He insists at considerable length, and with a\nvehemence which in itself makes it plain that an opposite opinion was\nheld in some quarters, that it was no part of the design of Blood or of\nany of his companions in misfortune to join hands with the buccaneers\nwho, under a semi-official French protection, made of Tortuga a lair\nwhence they could sally out to drive their merciless piratical trade\nchiefly at the expense of Spain.\n\nIt was, Pitt tells us, Blood's original intention to make his way to\nFrance or Holland. But in the long weeks of waiting for a ship to convey\nhim to one or the other of these countries, his resources dwindled and\nfinally vanished. Also, his chronicler thinks that he detected signs of\nsome secret trouble in his friend, and he attributes to this the abuses\nof the potent West Indian spirit of which Blood became guilty in those\ndays of inaction, thereby sinking to the level of the wild adventurers\nwith whom ashore he associated.\n\nI do not think that Pitt is guilty in this merely of special pleading,\nthat he is putting forward excuses for his hero. I think that in those\ndays there was a good deal to oppress Peter Blood. There was the thought\nof Arabella Bishop--and that this thought loomed large in his mind we\nare not permitted to doubt. He was maddened by the tormenting lure of\nthe unattainable. He desired Arabella, yet knew her beyond his reach\nirrevocably and for all time. Also, whilst he may have desired to go to\nFrance or Holland, he had no clear purpose to accomplish when he reached\none or the other of these countries. He was, when all is said, an\nescaped slave, an outlaw in his own land and a homeless outcast in any\nother. There remained the sea, which is free to all, and particularly\nalluring to those who feel themselves at war with humanity. And so,\nconsidering the adventurous spirit that once already had sent him\na-roving for the sheer love of it, considering that this spirit was\nheightened now by a recklessness begotten of his outlawry, that his\ntraining and skill in militant seamanship clamorously supported the\ntemptations that were put before him, can you wonder, or dare you blame\nhim, that in the end he succumbed? And remember that these temptations\nproceeded not only from adventurous buccaneering acquaintances in the\ntaverns of that evil haven of Tortuga, but even from M. d'Ogeron, the\ngovernor of the island, who levied as his harbour dues a percentage of\none tenth of all spoils brought into the bay, and who profited further\nby commissions upon money which he was desired to convert into bills of\nexchange upon France.\n\nA trade that might have worn a repellent aspect when urged by greasy,\nhalf-drunken adventurers, boucan-hunters, lumbermen, beach-combers,\nEnglish, French, and Dutch, became a dignified, almost official form of\nprivateering when advocated by the courtly, middle-aged gentleman who\nin representing the French West India Company seemed to represent France\nherself.\n\nMoreover, to a man--not excluding Jeremy Pitt himself, in whose blood\nthe call of the sea was insistent and imperative--those who had escaped\nwith Peter Blood from the Barbados plantations, and who, consequently,\nlike himself, knew not whither to turn, were all resolved upon joining\nthe great Brotherhood of the Coast, as those rovers called themselves.\nAnd they united theirs to the other voices that were persuading Blood,\ndemanding that he should continue now in the leadership which he had\nenjoyed since they had left Barbados, and swearing to follow him loyally\nwhithersoever he should lead them.\n\nAnd so, to condense all that Jeremy has recorded in the matter, Blood\nended by yielding to external and internal pressure, abandoned himself\nto the stream of Destiny. \"Fata viam invenerunt,\" is his own expression\nof it.\n\nIf he resisted so long, it was, I think, the thought of Arabella Bishop\nthat restrained him. That they should be destined never to meet again\ndid not weigh at first, or, indeed, ever. He conceived the scorn with\nwhich she would come to hear of his having turned pirate, and the scorn,\nthough as yet no more than imagined, hurt him as if it were already a\nreality. And even when he conquered this, still the thought of her was\never present. He compromised with the conscience that her memory kept so\ndisconcertingly active. He vowed that the thought of her should continue\never before him to help him keep his hands as clean as a man might in\nthis desperate trade upon which he was embarking. And so, although he\nmight entertain no delusive hope of ever winning her for his own, of\never even seeing her again, yet the memory of her was to abide in his\nsoul as a bitter-sweet, purifying influence. The love that is never to\nbe realized will often remain a man's guiding ideal. The resolve\nbeing taken, he went actively to work. Ogeron, most accommodating of\ngovernors, advanced him money for the proper equipment of his ship the\nCinco Llagas, which he renamed the Arabella. This after some little\nhesitation, fearful of thus setting his heart upon his sleeve. But his\nBarbados friends accounted it merely an expression of the ever-ready\nirony in which their leader dealt.\n\nTo the score of followers he already possessed, he added threescore\nmore, picking his men with caution and discrimination--and he was an\nexceptional judge of men--from amongst the adventurers of Tortuga. With\nthem all he entered into the articles usual among the Brethren of the\nCoast under which each man was to be paid by a share in the prizes\ncaptured. In other respects, however, the articles were different.\nAboard the Arabella there was to be none of the ruffianly indiscipline\nthat normally prevailed in buccaneering vessels. Those who shipped with\nhim undertook obedience and submission in all things to himself and\nto the officers appointed by election. Any to whom this clause in the\narticles was distasteful might follow some other leader.\n\nTowards the end of December, when the hurricane season had blown itself\nout, he put to sea in his well-found, well-manned ship, and before he\nreturned in the following May from a protracted and adventurous cruise,\nthe fame of Captain Peter Blood had run like ripples before the breeze\nacross the face of the Caribbean Sea. There was a fight in the Windward\nPassage at the outset with a Spanish galleon, which had resulted in the\ngutting and finally the sinking of the Spaniard. There was a daring raid\neffected by means of several appropriated piraguas upon a Spanish pearl\nfleet in the Rio de la Hacha, from which they had taken a particularly\nrich haul of pearls. There was an overland expedition to the goldfields\nof Santa Maria, on the Main, the full tale of which is hardly credible,\nand there were lesser adventures through all of which the crew of the\nArabella came with credit and profit if not entirely unscathed.\n\nAnd so it happened that before the Arabella came homing to Tortuga in\nthe following May to refit and repair--for she was not without scars, as\nyou conceive--the fame of her and of Peter Blood her captain had swept\nfrom the Bahamas to the Windward Isles, from New Providence to Trinidad.\n\nAn echo of it had reached Europe, and at the Court of St. James's angry\nrepresentations were made by the Ambassador of Spain, to whom it was\nanswered that it must not be supposed that this Captain Blood held any\ncommission from the King of England; that he was, in fact, a proscribed\nrebel, an escaped slave, and that any measures against him by His\nCatholic Majesty would receive the cordial approbation of King James II.\n\nDon Miguel de Espinosa, the Admiral of Spain in the West Indies, and his\nnephew Don Esteban who sailed with him, did not lack the will to bring\nthe adventurer to the yardarm. With them this business of capturing\nBlood, which was now an international affair, was also a family matter.\n\nSpain, through the mouth of Don Miguel, did not spare her threats.\nThe report of them reached Tortuga, and with it the assurance that Don\nMiguel had behind him not only the authority of his own nation, but that\nof the English King as well.\n\nIt was a brutum fulmen that inspired no terrors in Captain Blood. Nor\nwas he likely, on account of it, to allow himself to run to rust in the\nsecurity of Tortuga. For what he had suffered at the hands of Man he had\nchosen to make Spain the scapegoat. Thus he accounted that he served a\ntwofold purpose: he took compensation and at the same time served, not\nindeed the Stuart King, whom he despised, but England and, for that\nmatter, all the rest of civilized mankind which cruel, treacherous,\ngreedy, bigoted Castile sought to exclude from intercourse with the New\nWorld.\n\nOne day as he sat with Hagthorpe and Wolverstone over a pipe and\na bottle of rum in the stifling reek of tar and stale tobacco of a\nwaterside tavern, he was accosted by a splendid ruffian in a gold-laced\ncoat of dark-blue satin with a crimson sash, a foot wide, about the\nwaist.\n\n\"C'est vous qu'on appelle Le Sang?\" the fellow hailed him.\n\nCaptain Blood looked up to consider the questioner before replying.\nThe man was tall and built on lines of agile strength, with a swarthy,\naquiline face that was brutally handsome. A diamond of great price\nflamed on the indifferently clean hand resting on the pummel of his long\nrapier, and there were gold rings in his ears, half-concealed by long\nringlets of oily chestnut hair.\n\nCaptain Blood took the pipe-stem from between his lips.\n\n\"My name,\" he said, \"is Peter Blood. The Spaniards know me for Don Pedro\nSangre and a Frenchman may call me Le Sang if he pleases.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said the gaudy adventurer in English, and without further\ninvitation he drew up a stool and sat down at that greasy table. \"My\nname,\" he informed the three men, two of whom at least were eyeing him\naskance, \"it is Levasseur. You may have heard of me.\"\n\nThey had, indeed. He commanded a privateer of twenty guns that had\ndropped anchor in the bay a week ago, manned by a crew mainly composed\nof French boucanhunters from Northern Hispaniola, men who had good cause\nto hate the Spaniard with an intensity exceeding that of the English.\nLevasseur had brought them back to Tortuga from an indifferently\nsuccessful cruise. It would need more, however, than lack of success\nto abate the fellow's monstrous vanity. A roaring, quarrelsome,\nhard-drinking, hard-gaming scoundrel, his reputation as a buccaneer\nstood high among the wild Brethren of the Coast. He enjoyed also a\nreputation of another sort. There was about his gaudy, swaggering\nraffishness something that the women found singularly alluring. That\nhe should boast openly of his bonnes fortunes did not seem strange to\nCaptain Blood; what he might have found strange was that there appeared\nto be some measure of justification for these boasts.\n\nIt was current gossip that even Mademoiselle d'Ogeron, the Governor's\ndaughter, had been caught in the snare of his wild attractiveness, and\nthat Levasseur had gone the length of audacity of asking her hand in\nmarriage of her father. M. d'Ogeron had made him the only possible\nanswer. He had shown him the door. Levasseur had departed in a rage,\nswearing that he would make mademoiselle his wife in the teeth of all\nthe fathers in Christendom, and that M. d'Ogeron should bitterly rue the\naffront he had put upon him.\n\nThis was the man who now thrust himself upon Captain Blood with a\nproposal of association, offering him not only his sword, but his ship\nand the men who sailed in her.\n\nA dozen years ago, as a lad of barely twenty, Levasseur had sailed with\nthat monster of cruelty L'Ollonais, and his own subsequent exploits\nbore witness and did credit to the school in which he had been reared. I\ndoubt if in his day there was a greater scoundrel among the Brethren of\nthe Coast than this Levasseur. And yet, repulsive though he found him,\nCaptain Blood could not deny that the fellow's proposals displayed\nboldness, imagination, and resource, and he was forced to admit that\njointly they could undertake operations of a greater magnitude than was\npossible singly to either of them. The climax of Levasseur's project was\nto be a raid upon the wealthy mainland city of Maracaybo; but for this,\nhe admitted, six hundred men at the very least would be required, and\nsix hundred men were not to be conveyed in the two bottoms they now\ncommanded. Preliminary cruises must take place, having for one of their\nobjects the capture of further ships.\n\nBecause he disliked the man, Captain Blood would not commit himself at\nonce. But because he liked the proposal he consented to consider it.\nBeing afterwards pressed by both Hagthorpe and Wolverstone, who did not\nshare his own personal dislike of the Frenchman, the end of the matter\nwas that within a week articles were drawn up between Levasseur\nand Blood, and signed by them and--as was usual--by the chosen\nrepresentatives of their followers.\n\nThese articles contained, inter alia, the common provisions that, should\nthe two vessels separate, a strict account must afterwards be rendered\nof all prizes severally taken, whilst the vessel taking a prize should\nretain three fifths of its value, surrendering two fifths to its\nassociate. These shares were subsequently to be subdivided among the\ncrew of each vessel, in accordance with the articles already obtaining\nbetween each captain and his own men. For the rest, the articles\ncontained all the clauses that were usual, among which was the clause\nthat any man found guilty of abstracting or concealing any part of a\nprize, be it of the value of no more than a peso, should be summarily\nhanged from the yardarm.\n\nAll being now settled they made ready for sea, and on the very eve of\nsailing, Levasseur narrowly escaped being shot in a romantic attempt\nto scale the wall of the Governor's garden, with the object of taking\npassionate leave of the infatuated Mademoiselle d'Ogeron. He desisted\nafter having been twice fired upon from a fragrant ambush of pimento\ntrees where the Governor's guards were posted, and he departed vowing to\ntake different and very definite measures on his return.\n\nThat night he slept on board his ship, which with characteristic\nflamboyance he had named La Foudre, and there on the following day he\nreceived a visit from Captain Blood, whom he greeted half-mockingly as\nhis admiral. The Irishman came to settle certain final details of which\nall that need concern us is an understanding that, in the event of the\ntwo vessels becoming separated by accident or design, they should rejoin\neach other as soon as might be at Tortuga.\n\nThereafter Levasseur entertained his admiral to dinner, and jointly they\ndrank success to the expedition, so copiously on the part of Levasseur\nthat when the time came to separate he was as nearly drunk as it seemed\npossible for him to be and yet retain his understanding.\n\nFinally, towards evening, Captain Blood went over the side and was rowed\nback to his great ship with her red bulwarks and gilded ports, touched\ninto a lovely thing of flame by the setting sun.\n\nHe was a little heavy-hearted. I have said that he was a judge of men,\nand his judgment of Levasseur filled him with misgivings which were\ngrowing heavier in a measure as the hour of departure approached.\n\nHe expressed it to Wolverstone, who met him as he stepped aboard the\nArabella:\n\n\"You over persuaded me into those articles, you blackguard; and it'll\nsurprise me if any good comes of this association.\"\n\nThe giant rolled his single bloodthirsty eye, and sneered, thrusting out\nhis heavy jaw. \"We'll wring the dog's neck if there's any treachery.\"\n\n\"So we will--if we are there to wring it by then.\" And on that,\ndismissing the matter: \"We sail in the morning, on the first of the\nebb,\" he announced, and went off to his cabin.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. LEVASSEUR'S HEROICS\n\n\nIt would be somewhere about ten o'clock on the following morning, a\nfull hour before the time appointed for sailing, when a canoe brought up\nalongside La Foudre, and a half-caste Indian stepped out of her and went\nup the ladder. He was clad in drawers of hairy, untanned hide, and a red\nblanket served him for a cloak. He was the bearer of a folded scrap of\npaper for Captain Levasseur.\n\nThe Captain unfolded the letter, sadly soiled and crumpled by contact\nwith the half-caste's person. Its contents may be roughly translated\nthus:\n\n\"My well-beloved--I am in the Dutch brig Jongvrow, which is about to\nsail. Resolved to separate us for ever, my cruel father is sending me to\nEurope in my brother's charge. I implore you, come to my rescue. Deliver\nme, my well-beloved hero!--Your desolated Madeleine, who loves you.\"\n\nThe well-beloved hero was moved to the soul of him by that passionate\nappeal. His scowling glance swept the bay for the Dutch brig, which\nhe knew had been due to sail for Amsterdam with a cargo of hides and\ntobacco.\n\nShe was nowhere to be seen among the shipping in that narrow, rock-bound\nharbour. He roared out the question in his mind.\n\nIn answer the half-caste pointed out beyond the frothing surf that\nmarked the position of the reef constituting one of the stronghold's\nmain defences. Away beyond it, a mile or so distant, a sail was standing\nout to sea. \"There she go,\" he said.\n\n\"There!\" The Frenchman gazed and stared, his face growing white. The\nman's wicked temper awoke, and turned to vent itself upon the messenger.\n\"And where have you been that you come here only now with this? Answer\nme!\"\n\nThe half-caste shrank terrified before his fury. His explanation, if he\nhad one, was paralyzed by fear. Levasseur took him by the throat, shook\nhim twice, snarling the while, then hurled him into the scuppers. The\nman's head struck the gunwale as he fell, and he lay there, quite still,\na trickle of blood issuing from his mouth.\n\nLevasseur dashed one hand against the other, as if dusting them.\n\n\"Heave that muck overboard,\" he ordered some of those who stood idling\nin the waist. \"Then up anchor, and let us after the Dutchman.\"\n\n\"Steady, Captain. What's that?\" There was a restraining hand upon his\nshoulder, and the broad face of his lieutenant Cahusac, a burly, callous\nBreton scoundrel, was stolidly confronting him.\n\nLevasseur made clear his purpose with a deal of unnecessary obscenity.\n\nCahusac shook his head. \"A Dutch brig!\" said he. \"Impossible! We should\nnever be allowed.\"\n\n\"And who the devil will deny us?\" Levasseur was between amazement and\nfury.\n\n\"For one thing, there's your own crew will be none too willing. For\nanother there's Captain Blood.\"\n\n\"I care nothing for Captain Blood....\"\n\n\"But it is necessary that you should. He has the power, the weight of\nmetal and of men, and if I know him at all he'll sink us before\nhe'll suffer interference with the Dutch. He has his own views of\nprivateering, this Captain Blood, as I warned you.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Levasseur, showing his teeth. But his eyes, riveted upon that\ndistant sail, were gloomily thoughtful. Not for long. The imagination\nand resource which Captain Blood had detected in the fellow soon\nsuggested a course.\n\nCursing in his soul, and even before the anchor was weighed, the\nassociation into which he had entered, he was already studying ways\nof evasion. What Cahusac implied was true: Blood would never suffer\nviolence to be done in his presence to a Dutchman; but it might be done\nin his absence; and, being done, Blood must perforce condone it, since\nit would then be too late to protest.\n\nWithin the hour the Arabella and La Foudre were beating out to sea\ntogether. Without understanding the change of plan involved, Captain\nBlood, nevertheless, accepted it, and weighed anchor before the\nappointed time upon perceiving his associate to do so.\n\nAll day the Dutch brig was in sight, though by evening she had dwindled\nto the merest speck on the northern horizon. The course prescribed\nfor Blood and Levasseur lay eastward along the northern shores of\nHispaniola. To that course the Arabella continued to hold steadily\nthroughout the night. When day broke again, she was alone. La Foudre\nunder cover of the darkness had struck away to The northeast with every\nrag of canvas on her yards.\n\nCahusac had attempted yet again to protest against this.\n\n\"The devil take you!\" Levasseur had answered him. \"A ship's a ship, be\nshe Dutch or Spanish, and ships are our present need. That will suffice\nfor the men.\"\n\nHis lieutenant said no more. But from his glimpse of the letter, knowing\nthat a girl and not a ship was his captain's real objective, he gloomily\nshook his head as he rolled away on his bowed legs to give the necessary\norders.\n\nDawn found La Foudre close on the Dutchman's heels, not a mile astern,\nand the sight of her very evidently flustered the Jongvrow. No doubt\nmademoiselle's brother recognizing Levasseur's ship would be responsible\nfor the Dutch uneasiness. They saw the Jongvrow crowding canvas in a\nfutile endeavour to outsail them, whereupon they stood off to starboard\nand raced on until they were in a position whence they could send\na warning shot across her bow. The Jongvrow veered, showed them her\nrudder, and opened fire with her stern chasers. The small shot went\nwhistling through La Foudre's shrouds with some slight damage to her\ncanvas. Followed a brief running fight in the course of which the\nDutchman let fly a broadside.\n\nFive minutes after that they were board and board, the Jongvrow held\ntight in the clutches of La Foudre's grapnels, and the buccaneers\npouring noisily into her waist.\n\nThe Dutchman's master, purple in the face, stood forward to beard the\npirate, followed closely by an elegant, pale-faced young gentleman in\nwhom Levasseur recognized his brother-in-law elect.\n\n\"Captain Levasseur, this is an outrage for which you shall be made to\nanswer. What do you seek aboard my ship?\"\n\n\"At first I sought only that which belongs to me, something of which I\nam being robbed. But since you chose war and opened fire on me with some\ndamage to my ship and loss of life to five of my men, why, war it is,\nand your ship a prize of war.\"\n\nFrom the quarter rail Mademoiselle d'Ogeron looked down with glowing\neyes in breathless wonder upon her well-beloved hero. Gloriously heroic\nhe seemed as he stood towering there, masterful, audacious, beautiful.\nHe saw her, and with a glad shout sprang towards her. The Dutch master\ngot in his way with hands upheld to arrest his progress. Levasseur did\nnot stay to argue with him: he was too impatient to reach his mistress.\nHe swung the poleaxe that he carried, and the Dutchman went down in\nblood with a cloven skull. The eager lover stepped across the body and\ncame on, his countenance joyously alight.\n\nBut mademoiselle was shrinking now, in horror. She was a girl upon the\nthreshold of glorious womanhood, of a fine height and nobly moulded,\nwith heavy coils of glossy black hair above and about a face that was of\nthe colour of old ivory. Her countenance was cast in lines of arrogance,\nstressed by the low lids of her full dark eyes.\n\nIn a bound her well-beloved was beside her, flinging away his bloody\npoleaxe, he opened wide his arms to enfold her. But she still shrank\neven within his embrace, which would not be denied; a look of dread had\ncome to temper the normal arrogance of her almost perfect face.\n\n\"Mine, mine at last, and in spite of all!\" he cried exultantly,\ntheatrically, truly heroic.\n\nBut she, endeavouring to thrust him back, her hands against his breast,\ncould only falter: \"Why, why did you kill him?\"\n\nHe laughed, as a hero should; and answered her heroically, with the\ntolerance of a god for the mortal to whom he condescends: \"He stood\nbetween us. Let his death be a symbol, a warning. Let all who would\nstand between us mark it and beware.\"\n\nIt was so splendidly terrific, the gesture of it was so broad and fine\nand his magnetism so compelling, that she cast her silly tremors and\nyielded herself freely, intoxicated, to his fond embrace. Thereafter he\nswung her to his shoulder, and stepping with ease beneath that burden,\nbore her in a sort of triumph, lustily cheered by his men, to the\ndeck of his own ship. Her inconsiderate brother might have ruined that\nromantic scene but for the watchful Cahusac, who quietly tripped him up,\nand then trussed him like a fowl.\n\nThereafter, what time the Captain languished in his lady's smile within\nthe cabin, Cahusac was dealing with the spoils of war. The Dutch crew\nwas ordered into the longboat, and bidden go to the devil. Fortunately,\nas they numbered fewer than thirty, the longboat, though perilously\novercrowded, could yet contain them. Next, Cahusac having inspected the\ncargo, put a quartermaster and a score of men aboard the Jongvrow, and\nleft her to follow La Foudre, which he now headed south for the Leeward\nIslands.\n\nCahusac was disposed to be ill-humoured. The risk they had run in\ntaking the Dutch brig and doing violence to members of the family of\nthe Governor of Tortuga, was out of all proportion to the value of their\nprize. He said so, sullenly, to Levasseur.\n\n\"You'll keep that opinion to yourself,\" the Captain answered him. \"Don't\nthink I am the man to thrust my neck into a noose, without knowing how\nI am going to take it out again. I shall send an offer of terms to the\nGovernor of Tortuga that he will be forced to accept. Set a course for\nthe Virgen Magra. We'll go ashore, and settle things from there. And\ntell them to fetch that milksop Ogeron to the cabin.\"\n\nLevasseur went back to the adoring lady.\n\nThither, too, the lady's brother was presently conducted. The Captain\nrose to receive him, bending his stalwart height to avoid striking the\ncabin roof with his head. Mademoiselle rose too.\n\n\"Why this?\" she asked Levasseur, pointing to her brother's pinioned\nwrists--the remains of Cahusac's precautions.\n\n\"I deplore it,\" said he. \"I desire it to end. Let M. d'Ogeron give me\nhis parole....\"\n\n\"I give you nothing,\" flashed the white-faced youth, who did not lack\nfor spirit.\n\n\"You see.\" Levasseur shrugged his deep regret, and mademoiselle turned\nprotesting to her brother.\n\n\"Henri, this is foolish! You are not behaving as my friend. You....\"\n\n\"Little fool,\" her brother answered her--and the \"little\" was out of\nplace; she was the taller of the twain. \"Little fool, do you think\nI should be acting as your friend to make terms with this blackguard\npirate?\"\n\n\"Steady, my young cockerel!\" Levasseur laughed. But his laugh was not\nnice.\n\n\"Don't you perceive your wicked folly in the harm it has brought\nalready? Lives have been lost--men have died--that this monster might\novertake you. And don't you yet realize where you stand--in the power\nof this beast, of this cur born in a kennel and bred in thieving and\nmurder?\"\n\nHe might have said more but that Levasseur struck him across the mouth.\nLevasseur, you see, cared as little as another to hear the truth about\nhimself.\n\nMademoiselle suppressed a scream, as the youth staggered back under the\nblow. He came to rest against a bulkhead, and leaned there with bleeding\nlips. But his spirit was unquenched, and there was a ghastly smile on\nhis white face as his eyes sought his sister's.\n\n\"You see,\" he said simply. \"He strikes a man whose hands are bound.\"\n\nThe simple words, and, more than the words, their tone of ineffable\ndisdain, aroused the passion that never slumbered deeply in Levasseur.\n\n\"And what should you do, puppy, if your hands were unbound?\" He took his\nprisoner by the breast of his doublet and shook him. \"Answer me! What\nshould you do? Tchah! You empty windbag! You....\" And then came a\ntorrent of words unknown to mademoiselle, yet of whose foulness her\nintuitions made her conscious.\n\nWith blanched cheeks she stood by the cabin table, and cried out to\nLevasseur to stop. To obey her, he opened the door, and flung her\nbrother through it.\n\n\"Put that rubbish under hatches until I call for it again,\" he roared,\nand shut the door.\n\nComposing himself, he turned to the girl again with a deprecatory smile.\nBut no smile answered him from her set face. She had seen her beloved\nhero's nature in curl-papers, as it were, and she found the spectacle\ndisgusting and terrifying. It recalled the brutal slaughter of the Dutch\ncaptain, and suddenly she realized that what her brother had just said\nof this man was no more than true. Fear growing to panic was written on\nher face, as she stood there leaning for support against the table.\n\n\"Why, sweetheart, what is this?\" Levasseur moved towards her. She\nrecoiled before him. There was a smile on his face, a glitter in his\neyes that fetched her heart into her throat.\n\nHe caught her, as she reached the uttermost limits of the cabin, seized\nher in his long arms and pulled her to him.\n\n\"No, no!\" she panted.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" he mocked her, and his mockery was the most terrible thing\nof all. He crushed her to him brutally, deliberately hurtful because she\nresisted, and kissed her whilst she writhed in his embrace. Then, his\npassion mounting, he grew angry and stripped off the last rag of hero's\nmask that still may have hung upon his face. \"Little fool, did you\nnot hear your brother say that you are in my power? Remember it, and\nremember that of your own free will you came. I am not the man with whom\na woman can play fast and loose. So get sense, my girl, and accept what\nyou have invited.\" He kissed her again, almost contemptuously, and flung\nher off. \"No more scowls,\" he said. \"You'll be sorry else.\"\n\nSome one knocked. Cursing the interruption, Levasseur strode off to\nopen. Cahusac stood before him. The Breton's face was grave. He came\nto report that they had sprung a leak between wind and water, the\nconsequence of damage sustained from one of the Dutchman's shots. In\nalarm Levasseur went off with him. The leakage was not serious so long\nas the weather kept fine; but should a storm overtake them it might\nspeedily become so. A man was slung overboard to make a partial stoppage\nwith a sail-cloth, and the pumps were got to work.\n\nAhead of them a low cloud showed on the horizon, which Cahusac\npronounced one of the northernmost of the Virgin Islands.\n\n\"We must run for shelter there, and careen her,\" said Levasseur. \"I\ndo not trust this oppressive heat. A storm may catch us before we make\nland.\"\n\n\"A storm or something else,\" said Cahusac grimly. \"Have you noticed\nthat?\" He pointed away to starboard.\n\nLevasseur looked, and caught his breath. Two ships that at the distance\nseemed of considerable burden were heading towards them some five miles\naway.\n\n\"If they follow us what is to happen?\" demanded Cahusac.\n\n\"We'll fight whether we're in case to do so or not,\" swore Levasseur.\n\n\"Counsels of despair.\" Cahusac was contemptuous. To mark it he spat upon\nthe deck. \"This comes of going to sea with a lovesick madman. Now, keep\nyour temper, Captain, for the hands will be at the end of theirs if we\nhave trouble as a result of this Dutchman business.\"\n\nFor the remainder of that day Levasseur's thoughts were of anything but\nlove. He remained on deck, his eyes now upon the land, now upon those\ntwo slowly gaining ships. To run for the open could avail him nothing,\nand in his leaky condition would provide an additional danger. He must\nstand at bay and fight. And then, towards evening, when within three\nmiles of shore and when he was about to give the order to strip\nfor battle, he almost fainted from relief to hear a voice from the\ncrow's-nest above announce that the larger of the two ships was the\nArabella. Her companion was presumably a prize.\n\nBut the pessimism of Cahusac abated nothing.\n\n\"That is but the lesser evil,\" he growled. \"What will Blood say about\nthis Dutchman?\"\n\n\"Let him say what he pleases.\" Levasseur laughed in the immensity of his\nrelief.\n\n\"And what about the children of the Governor of Tortuga?\"\n\n\"He must not know.\"\n\n\"He'll come to know in the end.\"\n\n\"Aye, but by then, morbleu, the matter will be settled. I shall have\nmade my peace with the Governor. I tell you I know the way to compel\nOgeron to come to terms.\"\n\nPresently the four vessels lay to off the northern coast of La Virgen\nMagra, a narrow little island arid and treeless, some twelve miles\nby three, uninhabited save by birds and turtles and unproductive of\nanything but salt, of which there were considerable ponds to the south.\n\nLevasseur put off in a boat accompanied by Cahusac and two other\nofficers, and went to visit Captain Blood aboard the Arabella.\n\n\"Our brief separation has been mighty profitable,\" was Captain\nBlood's greeting. \"It's a busy morning we've both had.\" He was in high\ngood-humour as he led the way to the great cabin for a rendering of\naccounts.\n\nThe tall ship that accompanied the Arabella was a Spanish vessel of\ntwenty-six guns, the Santiago from Puerto Rico with a hundred and twenty\nthousand weight of cacao, forty thousand pieces of eight, and the value\nof ten thousand more in jewels. A rich capture of which two fifths under\nthe articles went to Levasseur and his crew. Of the money and jewels a\ndivision was made on the spot. The cacao it was agreed should be taken\nto Tortuga to be sold.\n\nThen it was the turn of Levasseur, and black grew the brow of Captain\nBlood as the Frenchman's tale was unfolded. At the end he roundly\nexpressed his disapproval. The Dutch were a friendly people whom it was\na folly to alienate, particularly for so paltry a matter as these hides\nand tobacco, which at most would fetch a bare twenty thousand pieces.\n\nBut Levasseur answered him, as he had answered Cahusac, that a ship was\na ship, and it was ships they needed against their projected enterprise.\nPerhaps because things had gone well with him that day, Blood ended\nby shrugging the matter aside. Thereupon Levasseur proposed that the\nArabella and her prize should return to Tortuga there to unload the\ncacao and enlist the further adventurers that could now be shipped.\nLevasseur meanwhile would effect certain necessary repairs, and\nthen proceeding south, await his admiral at Saltatudos, an island\nconveniently situated--in the latitude of 11 deg. 11' N.--for their\nenterprise against Maracaybo.\n\nTo Levasseur's relief, Captain Blood not only agreed, but pronounced\nhimself ready to set sail at once.\n\nNo sooner had the Arabella departed than Levasseur brought his ships\ninto the lagoon, and set his crew to work upon the erection of temporary\nquarters ashore for himself, his men, and his enforced guests during the\ncareening and repairing of La Foudre.\n\nAt sunset that evening the wind freshened; it grew to a gale, and from\nthat to such a hurricane that Levasseur was thankful to find himself\nashore and his ships in safe shelter. He wondered a little how it might\nbe faring with Captain Blood out there at the mercy of that terrific\nstorm; but he did not permit concern to trouble him unduly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. THE RANSOM\n\n\nIn the glory of the following morning, sparkling and clear after the\nstorm, with an invigorating, briny tang in the air from the salt-ponds\non the south of the island, a curious scene was played on the beach of\nthe Virgen Magra, at the foot of a ridge of bleached dunes, beside the\nspread of sail from which Levasseur had improvised a tent.\n\nEnthroned upon an empty cask sat the French filibuster to transact\nimportant business: the business of making himself safe with the\nGovernor of Tortuga.\n\nA guard of honour of a half-dozen officers hung about him; five of them\nwere rude boucan-hunters, in stained jerkins and leather breeches; the\nsixth was Cahusac. Before him, guarded by two half-naked negroes, stood\nyoung d'Ogeron, in frilled shirt and satin small-clothes and fine shoes\nof Cordovan leather. He was stripped of doublet, and his hands were tied\nbehind him. The young gentleman's comely face was haggard. Near at\nhand, and also under guard, but unpinioned, mademoiselle his sister sat\nhunched upon a hillock of sand. She was very pale, and it was in vain\nthat she sought to veil in a mask of arrogance the fears by which she\nwas assailed.\n\nLevasseur addressed himself to M. d'Ogeron. He spoke at long length. In\nthe end--\n\n\"I trust, monsieur,\" said he, with mock suavity, \"that I have made\nmyself quite clear. So that there may be no misunderstandings, I will\nrecapitulate. Your ransom is fixed at twenty thousand pieces of eight,\nand you shall have liberty on parole to go to Tortuga to collect it.\nIn fact, I shall provide the means to convey you thither, and you shall\nhave a month in which to come and go. Meanwhile, your sister remains\nwith me as a hostage. Your father should not consider such a sum\nexcessive as the price of his son's liberty and to provide a dowry for\nhis daughter. Indeed, if anything, I am too modest, pardi! M. d'Ogeron\nis reputed a wealthy man.\"\n\nM. d'Ogeron the younger raised his head and looked the Captain boldly in\nthe face.\n\n\"I refuse--utterly and absolutely, do you understand? So do your worst,\nand be damned for a filthy pirate without decency and without honour.\"\n\n\"But what words!\" laughed Levasseur. \"What heat and what foolishness!\nYou have not considered the alternative. When you do, you will not\npersist in your refusal. You will not do that in any case. We have spurs\nfor the reluctant. And I warn you against giving me your parole under\nstress, and afterwards playing me false. I shall know how to find and\npunish you. Meanwhile, remember your sister's honour is in pawn to me.\nShould you forget to return with the dowry, you will not consider it\nunreasonable that I forget to marry her.\"\n\nLevasseur's smiling eyes, intent upon the young man's face, saw the\nhorror that crept into his glance. M. d'Ogeron cast a wild glance at\nmademoiselle, and observed the grey despair that had almost stamped the\nbeauty from her face. Disgust and fury swept across his countenance.\n\nThen he braced himself and answered resolutely:\n\n\"No, you dog! A thousand times, no!\"\n\n\"You are foolish to persist.\" Levasseur spoke without anger, with a\ncoldly mocking regret. His fingers had been busy tying knots in a length\nof whipcord. He held it up. \"You know this? It is a rosary of pain that\nhas wrought the conversion of many a stubborn heretic. It is capable\nof screwing the eyes out of a man's head by way of helping him to see\nreason. As you please.\"\n\nHe flung the length of knotted cord to one of the negroes, who in an\ninstant made it fast about the prisoner's brows. Then between cord and\ncranium the black inserted a short length of metal, round and slender\nas a pipe-stem. That done he rolled his eyes towards Levasseur, awaiting\nthe Captain's signal.\n\nLevasseur considered his victim, and beheld him tense and braced, his\nhaggard face of a leaden hue, beads of perspiration glinting on his\npallid brow just beneath the whipcord.\n\nMademoiselle cried out, and would have risen: but her guards restrained\nher, and she sank down again, moaning.\n\n\"I beg that you will spare yourself and your sister,\" said the Captain,\n\"by being reasonable. What, after all, is the sum I have named? To your\nwealthy father a bagatelle. I repeat, I have been too modest. But since\nI have said twenty thousand pieces of eight, twenty thousand pieces it\nshall be.\"\n\n\"And for what, if you please, have you said twenty thousand pieces of\neight?\"\n\nIn execrable French, but in a voice that was crisp and pleasant, seeming\nto echo some of the mockery that had invested Levasseur's, that question\nfloated over their heads.\n\nStartled, Levasseur and his officers looked up and round. On the crest\nof the dunes behind them, in sharp silhouette against the deep cobalt of\nthe sky, they beheld a tall, lean figure scrupulously dressed in black\nwith silver lace, a crimson ostrich plume curled about the broad brim of\nhis hat affording the only touch of colour. Under that hat was the tawny\nface of Captain Blood.\n\nLevasseur gathered himself up with an oath of amazement. He had\nconceived Captain Blood by now well below the horizon, on his way to\nTortuga, assuming him to have been so fortunate as to have weathered\nlast night's storm.\n\nLaunching himself upon the yielding sand, into which he sank to the\nlevel of the calves of his fine boots of Spanish leather, Captain Blood\ncame sliding erect to the beach. He was followed by Wolverstone, and\na dozen others. As he came to a standstill, he doffed his hat, with a\nflourish, to the lady. Then he turned to Levasseur.\n\n\"Good-morning, my Captain,\" said he, and proceeded to explain his\npresence. \"It was last night's hurricane compelled our return. We had no\nchoice but to ride before it with stripped poles, and it drove us back\nthe way we had gone. Moreover--as the devil would have it!--the Santiago\nsprang her mainmast; and so I was glad to put into a cove on the west\nof the island a couple of miles away, and we've walked across to\nstretch our legs, and to give you good-day. But who are these?\" And he\ndesignated the man and the woman.\n\nCahusac shrugged his shoulders, and tossed his long arms to heaven.\n\n\"Voila!\" said he, pregnantly, to the firmament.\n\nLevasseur gnawed his lip, and changed colour. But he controlled himself\nto answer civilly:\n\n\"As you see, two prisoners.\"\n\n\"Ah! Washed ashore in last night's gale, eh?\"\n\n\"Not so.\" Levasseur contained himself with difficulty before that irony.\n\"They were in the Dutch brig.\"\n\n\"I don't remember that you mentioned them before.\"\n\n\"I did not. They are prisoners of my own--a personal matter. They are\nFrench.\"\n\n\"French!\" Captain Blood's light eyes stabbed at Levasseur, then at the\nprisoners.\n\nM. d'Ogeron stood tense and braced as before, but the grey horror had\nleft his face. Hope had leapt within him at this interruption, obviously\nas little expected by his tormentor as by himself. His sister, moved\nby a similar intuition, was leaning forward with parted lips and gaping\neyes.\n\nCaptain Blood fingered his lip, and frowned thoughtfully upon Levasseur.\n\n\"Yesterday you surprised me by making war upon the friendly Dutch. But\nnow it seems that not even your own countrymen are safe from you.\"\n\n\"Have I not said that these... that this is a matter personal to me?\"\n\n\"Ah! And their names?\"\n\nCaptain Blood's crisp, authoritative, faintly disdainful manner stirred\nLevasseur's quick anger. The blood crept slowly back into his blenched\nface, and his glance grew in insolence, almost in menace. Meanwhile the\nprisoner answered for him.\n\n\"I am Henri d'Ogeron, and this is my sister.\"\n\n\"D'Ogeron?\" Captain Blood stared. \"Are you related by chance to my good\nfriend the Governor of Tortuga?\"\n\n\"He is my father.\"\n\nLevasseur swung aside with an imprecation. In Captain Blood, amazement\nfor the moment quenched every other emotion.\n\n\"The saints preserve us now! Are you quite mad, Levasseur? First you\nmolest the Dutch, who are our friends; next you take prisoners two\npersons that are French, your own countrymen; and now, faith, they're no\nless than the children of the Governor of Tortuga, which is the one safe\nplace of shelter that we enjoy in these islands....\"\n\nLevasseur broke in angrily:\n\n\"Must I tell you again that it is a matter personal to me? I make myself\nalone responsible to the Governor of Tortuga.\"\n\n\"And the twenty thousand pieces of eight? Is that also a matter personal\nto you?\"\n\n\"It is.\"\n\n\"Now I don't agree with you at all.\" Captain Blood sat down on the cask\nthat Levasseur had lately occupied, and looked up blandly. \"I may inform\nyou, to save time, that I heard the entire proposal that you made to\nthis lady and this gentleman, and I'll also remind you that we sail\nunder articles that admit no ambiguities. You have fixed their ransom at\ntwenty thousand pieces of eight. That sum then belongs to your crews and\nmine in the proportions by the articles established. You'll hardly wish\nto dispute it. But what is far more grave is that you have concealed\nfrom me this part of the prizes taken on your last cruise, and for\nsuch an offence as that the articles provide certain penalties that are\nsomething severe in character.\"\n\n\"Ho, ho!\" laughed Levasseur unpleasantly. Then added: \"If you dislike my\nconduct we can dissolve the association.\"\n\n\"That is my intention. But we'll dissolve it when and in the manner that\nI choose, and that will be as soon as you have satisfied the articles\nunder which we sailed upon this cruise.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I'll be as short as I can,\" said Captain Blood. \"I'll waive for the\nmoment the unseemliness of making war upon the Dutch, of taking French\nprisoners, and of provoking the anger of the Governor of Tortuga. I'll\naccept the situation as I find it. Yourself you've fixed the ransom of\nthis couple at twenty thousand pieces, and, as I gather, the lady is\nto be your perquisite. But why should she be your perquisite more than\nanother's, seeing that she belongs by the articles to all of us, as a\nprize of war?\"\n\nBlack as thunder grew the brow of Levasseur.\n\n\"However,\" added Captain Blood, \"I'll not dispute her to you if you are\nprepared to buy her.\"\n\n\"Buy her?\"\n\n\"At the price you have set upon her.\"\n\nLevasseur contained his rage, that he might reason with the Irishman.\n\"That is the ransom of the man. It is to be paid for him by the Governor\nof Tortuga.\"\n\n\"No, no. Ye've parcelled the twain together--very oddly, I confess.\nYe've set their value at twenty thousand pieces, and for that sum you\nmay have them, since you desire it; but you'll pay for them the twenty\nthousand pieces that are ultimately to come to you as the ransom of\none and the dowry of the other; and that sum shall be divided among our\ncrews. So that you do that, it is conceivable that our followers may\ntake a lenient view of your breach of the articles we jointly signed.\"\n\nLevasseur laughed savagely. \"Ah ca! Credieu! The good jest!\"\n\n\"I quite agree with you,\" said Captain Blood.\n\nTo Levasseur the jest lay in that Captain Blood, with no more than a\ndozen followers, should come there attempting to hector him who had a\nhundred men within easy call. But it seemed that he had left out of his\nreckoning something which his opponent had counted in. For as, laughing\nstill, Levasseur swung to his officers, he saw that which choked the\nlaughter in his throat. Captain Blood had shrewdly played upon the\ncupidity that was the paramount inspiration of those adventurers. And\nLevasseur now read clearly on their faces how completely they adopted\nCaptain Blood's suggestion that all must participate in the ransom which\ntheir leader had thought to appropriate to himself.\n\nIt gave the gaudy ruffian pause, and whilst in his heart he cursed\nthose followers of his, who could be faithful only to their greed, he\nperceived--and only just in time--that he had best tread warily.\n\n\"You misunderstand,\" he said, swallowing his rage. \"The ransom is\nfor division, when it comes. The girl, meanwhile, is mine on that\nunderstanding.\"\n\n\"Good!\" grunted Cahusac. \"On that understanding all arranges itself.\"\n\n\"You think so?\" said Captain Blood. \"But if M. d'Ogeron should refuse to\npay the ransom? What then?\" He laughed, and got lazily to his feet. \"No,\nno. If Captain Levasseur is meanwhile to keep the girl, as he proposes,\nthen let him pay this ransom, and be his the risk if it should\nafterwards not be forthcoming.\"\n\n\"That's it!\" cried one of Levasseur's officers. And Cahusac added: \"It's\nreasonable, that! Captain Blood is right. It is in the articles.\"\n\n\"What is in the articles, you fools?\" Levasseur was in danger of losing\nhis head. \"Sacre Dieu! Where do you suppose that I have twenty thousand\npieces? My whole share of the prizes of this cruise does not come to\nhalf that sum. I'll be your debtor until I've earned it. Will that\ncontent you?\"\n\nAll things considered, there is not a doubt that it would have done so\nhad not Captain Blood intended otherwise.\n\n\"And if you should die before you have earned it? Ours is a calling\nfraught with risks, my Captain.\"\n\n\"Damn you!\" Levasseur flung upon him livid with fury. \"Will nothing\nsatisfy you?\"\n\n\"Oh, but yes. Twenty thousand pieces of eight for immediate division.\"\n\n\"I haven't got it.\"\n\n\"Then let some one buy the prisoners who has.\"\n\n\"And who do you suppose has it if I have not?\"\n\n\"I have,\" said Captain Blood.\n\n\"You have!\" Levasseur's mouth fell open. \"You... you want the girl?\"\n\n\"Why not? And I exceed you in gallantry in that I will make sacrifices\nto obtain her, and in honesty in that I am ready to pay for what I\nwant.\"\n\nLevasseur stared at him foolishly agape. Behind him pressed his\nofficers, gaping also.\n\nCaptain Blood sat down again on the cask, and drew from an inner pocket\nof his doublet a little leather bag. \"I am glad to be able to resolve a\ndifficulty that at one moment seemed insoluble.\" And under the bulging\neyes of Levasseur and his officers, he untied the mouth of the bag and\nrolled into his left palm four or five pearls each of the size of a\nsparrow's egg. There were twenty such in the bag, the very pick of\nthose taken in that raid upon the pearl fleet. \"You boast a knowledge of\npearls, Cahusac. At what do you value this?\"\n\nThe Breton took between coarse finger and thumb the proffered lustrous,\ndelicately iridescent sphere, his shrewd eyes appraising it.\n\n\"A thousand pieces,\" he answered shortly.\n\n\"It will fetch rather more in Tortuga or Jamaica,\" said Captain Blood,\n\"and twice as much in Europe. But I'll accept your valuation. They are\nalmost of a size, as you can see. Here are twelve, representing twelve\nthousand pieces of eight, which is La Foudre's share of three fifths of\nthe prize, as provided by the articles. For the eight thousand pieces\nthat go to the Arabella, I make myself responsible to my own men. And\nnow, Wolverstone, if you please, will you take my property aboard the\nArabella?\" He stood up again, indicating the prisoners.\n\n\"Ah, no!\" Levasseur threw wide the floodgates of his fury. \"Ah, that,\nno, by example! You shall not take her....\" He would have sprung upon\nCaptain Blood, who stood aloof, alert, tight-lipped, and watchful.\n\nBut it was one of Levasseur's own officers who hindered him.\n\n\"Nom de Dieu, my Captain! What will you do? It is settled; honourably\nsettled with satisfaction to all.\"\n\n\"To all?\" blazed Levasseur. \"Ah ca! To all of you, you animals! But what\nof me?\"\n\nCahusac, with the pearls clutched in his capacious hand, stepped up to\nhim on the other side. \"Don't be a fool, Captain. Do you want to provoke\ntrouble between the crews? His men outnumber us by nearly two to one.\nWhat's a girl more or less? In Heaven's name, let her go. He's paid\nhandsomely for her, and dealt fairly with us.\"\n\n\"Dealt fairly?\" roared the infuriated Captain. \"You....\" In all his\nfoul vocabulary he could find no epithet to describe his lieutenant.\nHe caught him a blow that almost sent him sprawling. The pearls were\nscattered in the sand.\n\nCahusac dived after them, his fellows with him. Vengeance must wait.\nFor some moments they groped there on hands and knees, oblivious of all\nelse. And yet in those moments vital things were happening.\n\nLevasseur, his hand on his sword, his face a white mask of rage, was\nconfronting Captain Blood to hinder his departure.\n\n\"You do not take her while I live!\" he cried.\n\n\"Then I'll take her when you're dead,\" said Captain Blood, and his own\nblade flashed in the sunlight. \"The articles provide that any man of\nwhatever rank concealing any part of a prize, be it of the value of no\nmore than a peso, shall be hanged at the yardarm. It's what I intended\nfor you in the end. But since ye prefer it this way, ye muckrake, faith,\nI'll be humouring you.\"\n\nHe waved away the men who would have interfered, and the blades rang\ntogether.\n\nM. d'Ogeron looked on, a man bemused, unable to surmise what the issue\neither way could mean for him. Meanwhile, two of Blood's men who had\ntaken the place of the Frenchman's negro guards, had removed the crown\nof whipcord from his brow. As for mademoiselle, she had risen, and was\nleaning forward, a hand pressed tightly to her heaving breast, her face\ndeathly pale, a wild terror in her eyes.\n\nIt was soon over. The brute strength, upon which Levasseur so\nconfidently counted, could avail nothing against the Irishman's\npractised skill. When, with both lungs transfixed, he lay prone on the\nwhite sand, coughing out his rascally life, Captain Blood looked calmly\nat Cahusac across the body.\n\n\"I think that cancels the articles between us,\" he said. With soulless,\ncynical eyes Cahusac considered the twitching body of his recent leader.\nHad Levasseur been a man of different temper, the affair might have\nended in a very different manner. But, then, it is certain that Captain\nBlood would have adopted in dealing with him different tactics. As it\nwas, Levasseur commanded neither love nor loyalty. The men who followed\nhim were the very dregs of that vile trade, and cupidity was their only\ninspiration. Upon that cupidity Captain Blood had deftly played, until\nhe had brought them to find Levasseur guilty of the one offence they\ndeemed unpardonable, the crime of appropriating to himself something\nwhich might be converted into gold and shared amongst them all.\n\nThus now the threatening mob of buccaneers that came hastening to the\ntheatre of that swift tragi-comedy were appeased by a dozen words of\nCahusac's.\n\nWhilst still they hesitated, Blood added something to quicken their\ndecision.\n\n\"If you will come to our anchorage, you shall receive at once your share\nof the booty of the Santiago, that you may dispose of it as you please.\"\n\nThey crossed the island, the two prisoners accompanying them, and later\nthat day, the division made, they would have parted company but that\nCahusac, at the instances of the men who had elected him Levasseur's\nsuccessor, offered Captain Blood anew the services of that French\ncontingent.\n\n\"If you will sail with me again,\" the Captain answered him, \"you may do\nso on the condition that you make your peace with the Dutch, and restore\nthe brig and her cargo.\"\n\nThe condition was accepted, and Captain Blood went off to find his\nguests, the children of the Governor of Tortuga.\n\nMademoiselle d'Ogeron and her brother--the latter now relieved of his\nbonds--sat in the great cabin of the Arabella, whither they had been\nconducted.\n\nWine and food had been placed upon the table by Benjamin, Captain\nBlood's negro steward and cook, who had intimated to them that it was\nfor their entertainment. But it had remained untouched. Brother and\nsister sat there in agonized bewilderment, conceiving that their escape\nwas but from frying-pan to fire. At length, overwrought by the suspense,\nmademoiselle flung herself upon her knees before her brother to implore\nhis pardon for all the evil brought upon them by her wicked folly.\n\nM. d'Ogeron was not in a forgiving mood.\n\n\"I am glad that at least you realize what you have done. And now this\nother filibuster has bought you, and you belong to him. You realize\nthat, too, I hope.\"\n\nHe might have said more, but he checked upon perceiving that the door\nwas opening. Captain Blood, coming from settling matters with the\nfollowers of Levasseur, stood on the threshold. M. d'Ogeron had not\ntroubled to restrain his high-pitched voice, and the Captain had\noverheard the Frenchman's last two sentences. Therefore he perfectly\nunderstood why mademoiselle should bound up at sight of him, and shrink\nback in fear.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said he in his vile but fluent French, \"I beg you to\ndismiss your fears. Aboard this ship you shall be treated with all\nhonour. So soon as we are in case to put to sea again, we steer a course\nfor Tortuga to take you home to your father. And pray do not consider\nthat I have bought you, as your brother has just said. All that I\nhave done has been to provide the ransom necessary to bribe a gang of\nscoundrels to depart from obedience to the arch-scoundrel who commanded\nthem, and so deliver you from all peril. Count it, if you please, a\nfriendly loan to be repaid entirely at your convenience.\"\n\nMademoiselle stared at him in unbelief. M. d'Ogeron rose to his feet.\n\n\"Monsieur, is it possible that you are serious?\"\n\n\"I am. It may not happen often nowadays. I may be a pirate. But my ways\nare not the ways of Levasseur, who should have stayed in Europe, and\npractised purse-cutting. I have a sort of honour--shall we say, some\nrags of honour?--remaining me from better days.\" Then on a brisker note\nhe added: \"We dine in an hour, and I trust that you will honour my table\nwith your company. Meanwhile, Benjamin will see, monsieur, that you are\nmore suitably provided in the matter of wardrobe.\"\n\nHe bowed to them, and turned to depart again, but mademoiselle detained\nhim.\n\n\"Monsieur!\" she cried sharply.\n\nHe checked and turned, whilst slowly she approached him, regarding him\nbetween dread and wonder.\n\n\"Oh, you are noble!\"\n\n\"I shouldn't put it as high as that myself,\" said he.\n\n\"You are, you are! And it is but right that you should know all.\"\n\n\"Madelon!\" her brother cried out, to restrain her.\n\nBut she would not be restrained. Her surcharged heart must overflow in\nconfidence.\n\n\"Monsieur, for what befell I am greatly at fault. This man--this\nLevasseur....\"\n\nHe stared, incredulous in his turn. \"My God! Is it possible? That\nanimal!\"\n\nAbruptly she fell on her knees, caught his hand and kissed it before he\ncould wrench it from her.\n\n\"What do you do?\" he cried.\n\n\"An amende. In my mind I dishonoured you by deeming you his like, by\nconceiving your fight with Levasseur a combat between jackals. On my\nknees, monsieur, I implore you to forgive me.\"\n\nCaptain Blood looked down upon her, and a smile broke on his lips,\nirradiating the blue eyes that looked so oddly light in that tawny face.\n\n\"Why, child,\" said he, \"I might find it hard to forgive you the\nstupidity of having thought otherwise.\"\n\nAs he handed her to her feet again, he assured himself that he had\nbehaved rather well in the affair. Then he sighed. That dubious fame of\nhis that had spread so quickly across the Caribbean would by now have\nreached the ears of Arabella Bishop. That she would despise him, he\ncould not doubt, deeming him no better than all the other scoundrels who\ndrove this villainous buccaneering trade. Therefore he hoped that some\necho of this deed might reach her also, and be set by her against\nsome of that contempt. For the whole truth, which he withheld from\nMademoiselle d'Ogeron, was that in venturing his life to save her, he\nhad been driven by the thought that the deed must be pleasing in the\neyes of Miss Bishop could she but witness it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. THE TRAP\n\n\nThat affair of Mademoiselle d'Ogeron bore as its natural fruit an\nimprovement in the already cordial relations between Captain Blood\nand the Governor of Tortuga. At the fine stone house, with its\ngreen-jalousied windows, which M. d'Ogeron had built himself in a\nspacious and luxuriant garden to the east of Cayona, the Captain became\na very welcome guest. M. d'Ogeron was in the Captain's debt for more\nthan the twenty thousand pieces of eight which he had provided for\nmademoiselle's ransom; and shrewd, hard bargain-driver though he might\nbe, the Frenchman could be generous and understood the sentiment of\ngratitude. This he now proved in every possible way, and under his\npowerful protection the credit of Captain Blood among the buccaneers\nvery rapidly reached its zenith.\n\nSo when it came to fitting out his fleet for that enterprise against\nMaracaybo, which had originally been Levasseur's project, he did not\nwant for either ships or men to follow him. He recruited five hundred\nadventurers in all, and he might have had as many thousands if he could\nhave offered them accommodation. Similarly without difficulty he might\nhave increased his fleet to twice its strength of ships but that he\npreferred to keep it what it was. The three vessels to which he confined\nit were the Arabella, the La Foudre, which Cahusac now commanded with a\ncontingent of some sixscore Frenchmen, and the Santiago, which had been\nrefitted and rechristened the Elizabeth, after that Queen of England\nwhose seamen had humbled Spain as Captain Blood now hoped to humble it\nagain. Hagthorpe, in virtue of his service in the navy, was appointed by\nBlood to command her, and the appointment was confirmed by the men.\n\nIt was some months after the rescue of Mademoiselle d'Ogeron--in August\nof that year 1687--that this little fleet, after some minor adventures\nwhich I pass over in silence, sailed into the great lake of Maracaybo\nand effected its raid upon that opulent city of the Main.\n\nThe affair did not proceed exactly as was hoped, and Blood's force came\nto find itself in a precarious position. This is best explained in the\nwords employed by Cahusac--which Pitt has carefully recorded--in the\ncourse of an altercation that broke out on the steps of the Church\nof Nuestra Senora del Carmen, which Captain Blood had impiously\nappropriated for the purpose of a corps-de-garde. I have said already\nthat he was a papist only when it suited him.\n\nThe dispute was being conducted by Hagthorpe, Wolverstone, and Pitt on\nthe one side, and Cahusac, out of whose uneasiness it all arose, on the\nother. Behind them in the sun-scorched, dusty square, sparsely fringed\nby palms, whose fronds drooped listlessly in the quivering heat, surged\na couple of hundred wild fellows belonging to both parties, their own\nexcitement momentarily quelled so that they might listen to what passed\namong their leaders.\n\nCahusac appeared to be having it all his own way, and he raised\nhis harsh, querulous voice so that all might hear his truculent\ndenunciation. He spoke, Pitt tells us, a dreadful kind of English, which\nthe shipmaster, however, makes little attempt to reproduce. His dress\nwas as discordant as his speech. It was of a kind to advertise his\ntrade, and ludicrously in contrast with the sober garb of Hagthorpe\nand the almost foppish daintiness of Jeremy Pitt. His soiled and\nblood-stained shirt of blue cotton was open in front, to cool his hairy\nbreast, and the girdle about the waist of his leather breeches carried\nan arsenal of pistols and a knife, whilst a cutlass hung from a leather\nbaldrick loosely slung about his body; above his countenance, broad and\nflat as a Mongolian's, a red scarf was swathed, turban-wise, about his\nhead.\n\n\"Is it that I have not warned you from the beginning that all was too\neasy?\" he demanded between plaintiveness and fury. \"I am no fool, my\nfriends. I have eyes, me. And I see. I see an abandoned fort at the\nentrance of the lake, and nobody there to fire a gun at us when we came\nin. Then I suspect the trap. Who would not that had eyes and brain? Bah!\nwe come on. What do we find? A city, abandoned like the fort; a city out\nof which the people have taken all things of value. Again I warn Captain\nBlood. It is a trap, I say. We are to come on; always to come on,\nwithout opposition, until we find that it is too late to go to sea\nagain, that we cannot go back at all. But no one will listen to me. You\nall know so much more. Name of God! Captain Blood, he will go on, and we\ngo on. We go to Gibraltar. True that at last, after long time, we catch\nthe Deputy-Governor; true, we make him pay big ransom for Gibraltar;\ntrue between that ransom and the loot we return here with some two\nthousand pieces of eight. But what is it, in reality, will you tell me?\nOr shall I tell you? It is a piece of cheese--a piece of cheese in a\nmousetrap, and we are the little mice. Goddam! And the cats--oh, the\ncats they wait for us! The cats are those four Spanish ships of war that\nhave come meantime. And they wait for us outside the bottle-neck of this\nlagoon. Mort de Dieu! That is what comes of the damned obstinacy of your\nfine Captain Blood.\"\n\nWolverstone laughed. Cahusac exploded in fury.\n\n\"Ah, sangdieu! Tu ris, animal? You laugh! Tell me this: How do we get\nout again unless we accept the terms of Monsieur the Admiral of Spain?\"\n\nFrom the buccaneers at the foot of the steps came an angry rumble of\napproval. The single eye of the gigantic Wolverstone rolled terribly,\nand he clenched his great fists as if to strike the Frenchman, who was\nexposing them to mutiny. But Cahusac was not daunted. The mood of the\nmen enheartened him.\n\n\"You think, perhaps, this your Captain Blood is the good God. That he\ncan make miracles, eh? He is ridiculous, you know, this Captain Blood;\nwith his grand air and his....\"\n\nHe checked. Out of the church at that moment, grand air and all,\nsauntered Peter Blood. With him came a tough, long-legged French\nsea-wolf named Yberville, who, though still young, had already won fame\nas a privateer commander before the loss of his own ship had driven him\nto take service under Blood. The Captain advanced towards that disputing\ngroup, leaning lightly upon his long ebony cane, his face shaded by a\nbroad-plumed hat. There was in his appearance nothing of the buccaneer.\nHe had much more the air of a lounger in the Mall or the Alameda--the\nlatter rather, since his elegant suit of violet taffetas with\ngold-embroidered button-holes was in the Spanish fashion. But the long,\nstout, serviceable rapier, thrust up behind by the left hand resting\nlightly on the pummel, corrected the impression. That and those steely\neyes of his announced the adventurer.\n\n\"You find me ridiculous, eh, Cahusac?\" said he, as he came to a halt\nbefore the Breton, whose anger seemed already to have gone out of him.\n\"What, then, must I find you?\" He spoke quietly, almost wearily. \"You\nwill be telling them that we have delayed, and that it is the delay that\nhas brought about our danger. But whose is the fault of that delay? We\nhave been a month in doing what should have been done, and what but for\nyour blundering would have been done, inside of a week.\"\n\n\"Ah ca! Nom de Dieu! Was it my fault that....\"\n\n\"Was it any one else's fault that you ran your ship La Foudre aground on\nthe shoal in the middle of the lake? You would not be piloted. You knew\nyour way. You took no soundings even. The result was that we lost three\nprecious days in getting canoes to bring off your men and your gear.\nThose three days gave the folk at Gibraltar not only time to hear of our\ncoming, but time in which to get away. After that, and because of it,\nwe had to follow the Governor to his infernal island fortress, and a\nfortnight and best part of a hundred lives were lost in reducing it.\nThat's how we come to have delayed until this Spanish fleet is fetched\nround from La Guayra by a guarda-costa; and if ye hadn't lost La Foudre,\nand so reduced our fleet from three ships to two, we should even now be\nable to fight our way through with a reasonable hope of succeeding.\nYet you think it is for you to come hectoring here, upbraiding us for a\nsituation that is just the result of your own ineptitude.\"\n\nHe spoke with a restraint which I trust you will agree was admirable\nwhen I tell you that the Spanish fleet guarding the bottle-neck exit\nof the great Lake of Maracaybo, and awaiting there the coming forth\nof Captain Blood with a calm confidence based upon its overwhelming\nstrength, was commanded by his implacable enemy, Don Miguel de Espinosa\ny Valdez, the Admiral of Spain. In addition to his duty to his country,\nthe Admiral had, as you know, a further personal incentive arising out\nof that business aboard the Encarnacion a year ago, and the death of\nhis brother Don Diego; and with him sailed his nephew Esteban, whose\nvindictive zeal exceeded the Admiral's own.\n\nYet, knowing all this, Captain Blood could preserve his calm in\nreproving the cowardly frenzy of one for whom the situation had not half\nthe peril with which it was fraught for himself. He turned from Cahusac\nto address the mob of buccaneers, who had surged nearer to hear him, for\nhe had not troubled to raise his voice. \"I hope that will correct some\nof the misapprehension that appears to have been disturbing you,\" said\nhe.\n\n\"There's no good can come of talking of what's past and done,\" cried\nCahusac, more sullen now than truculent. Whereupon Wolverstone laughed,\na laugh that was like the neighing of a horse. \"The question is: what\nare we to do now?\"\n\n\"Sure, now, there's no question at all,\" said Captain Blood.\n\n\"Indeed, but there is,\" Cahusac insisted. \"Don Miguel, the Spanish\nAdmiral, have offer us safe passage to sea if we will depart at once, do\nno damage to the town, release our prisoners, and surrender all that we\ntook at Gibraltar.\"\n\nCaptain Blood smiled quietly, knowing precisely how much Don Miguel's\nword was worth. It was Yberville who replied, in manifest scorn of his\ncompatriot:\n\n\"Which argues that, even at this disadvantage as he has us, the Spanish\nAdmiral is still afraid of us.\"\n\n\"That can be only because he not know our real weakness,\" was the fierce\nretort. \"And, anyway, we must accept these terms. We have no choice.\nThat is my opinion.\"\n\n\"Well, it's not mine, now,\" said Captain Blood. \"So, I've refused them.\"\n\n\"Refuse'!\" Cahusac's broad face grew purple. A muttering from the men\nbehind enheartened him. \"You have refuse'? You have refuse' already--and\nwithout consulting me?\"\n\n\"Your disagreement could have altered nothing. You'd have been outvoted,\nfor Hagthorpe here was entirely of my own mind. Still,\" he went on,\n\"if you and your own French followers wish to avail yourselves of the\nSpaniard's terms, we shall not hinder you. Send one of your prisoners to\nannounce it to the Admiral. Don Miguel will welcome your decision, you\nmay be sure.\"\n\nCahusac glowered at him in silence for a moment. Then, having controlled\nhimself, he asked in a concentrated voice:\n\n\"Precisely what answer have you make to the Admiral?\"\n\nA smile irradiated the face and eyes of Captain Blood. \"I have answered\nhim that unless within four-and-twenty hours we have his parole to stand\nout to sea, ceasing to dispute our passage or hinder our departure,\nand a ransom of fifty thousand pieces of eight for Maracaybo, we shall\nreduce this beautiful city to ashes, and thereafter go out and destroy\nhis fleet.\"\n\nThe impudence of it left Cahusac speechless. But among the English\nbuccaneers in the square there were many who savoured the audacious\nhumour of the trapped dictating terms to the trappers. Laughter broke\nfrom them. It spread into a roar of acclamation; for bluff is a weapon\ndear to every adventurer. Presently, when they understood it, even\nCahusac's French followers were carried off their feet by that wave of\njocular enthusiasm, until in his truculent obstinacy Cahusac remained\nthe only dissentient. He withdrew in mortification. Nor was he to be\nmollified until the following day brought him his revenge. This came\nin the shape of a messenger from Don Miguel with a letter in which\nthe Spanish Admiral solemnly vowed to God that, since the pirates had\nrefused his magnanimous offer to permit them to surrender with the\nhonours of war, he would now await them at the mouth of the lake there\nto destroy them on their coming forth. He added that should they delay\ntheir departure, he would so soon as he was reenforced by a fifth ship,\nthe Santo Nino, on its way to join him from La Guayra, himself come\ninside to seek them at Maracaybo.\n\nThis time Captain Blood was put out of temper.\n\n\"Trouble me no more,\" he snapped at Cahusac, who came growling to him\nagain. \"Send word to Don Miguel that you have seceded from me. He'll\ngive you safe conduct, devil a doubt. Then take one of the sloops, order\nyour men aboard and put to sea, and the devil go with you.\"\n\nCahusac would certainly have adopted that course if only his men had\nbeen unanimous in the matter. They, however, were torn between greed and\napprehension. If they went they must abandon their share of the plunder,\nwhich was considerable, as well as the slaves and other prisoners\nthey had taken. If they did this, and Captain Blood should afterwards\ncontrive to get away unscathed--and from their knowledge of his\nresourcefulness, the thing, however unlikely, need not be impossible--he\nmust profit by that which they now relinquished. This was a contingency\ntoo bitter for contemplation. And so, in the end, despite all that\nCahusac could say, the surrender was not to Don Miguel, but to Peter\nBlood. They had come into the venture with him, they asserted, and\nthey would go out of it with him or not at all. That was the message\nhe received from them that same evening by the sullen mouth of Cahusac\nhimself.\n\nHe welcomed it, and invited the Breton to sit down and join the council\nwhich was even then deliberating upon the means to be employed. This\ncouncil occupied the spacious patio of the Governor's house--which\nCaptain Blood had appropriated to his own uses--a cloistered stone\nquadrangle in the middle of which a fountain played coolly under a\ntrellis of vine. Orange-trees grew on two sides of it, and the still,\nevening air was heavy with the scent of them. It was one of those\npleasant exterior-interiors which Moorish architects had introduced to\nSpain and the Spaniards had carried with them to the New World.\n\nHere that council of war, composed of six men in all, deliberated until\nlate that night upon the plan of action which Captain Blood put forward.\n\nThe great freshwater lake of Maracaybo, nourished by a score of rivers\nfrom the snow-capped ranges that surround it on two sides, is some\nhundred and twenty miles in length and almost the same distance across\nat its widest. It is--as has been indicated--in the shape of a great\nbottle having its neck towards the sea at Maracaybo.\n\nBeyond this neck it widens again, and then the two long, narrow strips\nof land known as the islands of Vigilias and Palomas block the channel,\nstanding lengthwise across it. The only passage out to sea for vessels\nof any draught lies in the narrow strait between these islands. Palomas,\nwhich is some ten miles in length, is unapproachable for half a mile\non either side by any but the shallowest craft save at its eastern end,\nwhere, completely commanding the narrow passage out to sea, stands the\nmassive fort which the buccaneers had found deserted upon their coming.\nIn the broader water between this passage and the bar, the four Spanish\nships were at anchor in mid-channel. The Admiral's Encarnacion, which we\nalready know, was a mighty galleon of forty-eight great guns and eight\nsmall. Next in importance was the Salvador with thirty-six guns; the\nother two, the Infanta and the San Felipe, though smaller vessels, were\nstill formidable enough with their twenty guns and a hundred and fifty\nmen apiece.\n\nSuch was the fleet of which the gauntlet was to be run by Captain Blood\nwith his own Arabella of forty guns, the Elizabeth of twenty-six, and\ntwo sloops captured at Gibraltar, which they had indifferently armed\nwith four culverins each. In men they had a bare four hundred survivors\nof the five hundred-odd that had left Tortuga, to oppose to fully a\nthousand Spaniards manning the galleons.\n\nThe plan of action submitted by Captain Blood to that council was a\ndesperate one, as Cahusac uncompromisingly pronounced it.\n\n\"Why, so it is,\" said the Captain. \"But I've done things more\ndesperate.\" Complacently he pulled at a pipe that was loaded with that\nfragrant Sacerdotes tobacco for which Gibraltar was famous, and of\nwhich they had brought away some hogsheads. \"And what is more, they've\nsucceeded. Audaces fortuna juvat. Bedad, they knew their world, the old\nRomans.\"\n\nHe breathed into his companions and even into Cahusac some of his own\nspirit of confidence, and in confidence all went busily to work. For\nthree days from sunrise to sunset, the buccaneers laboured and sweated\nto complete the preparations for the action that was to procure them\ntheir deliverance. Time pressed. They must strike before Don Miguel de\nEspinosa received the reenforcement of that fifth galleon, the Santo\nNino, which was coming to join him from La Guayra.\n\nTheir principal operations were on the larger of the two sloops captured\nat Gibraltar; to which vessel was assigned the leading part in Captain\nBlood's scheme. They began by tearing down all bulkheads, until they\nhad reduced her to the merest shell, and in her sides they broke open\nso many ports that her gunwale was converted into the semblance of a\ngrating. Next they increased by a half-dozen the scuttles in her deck,\nwhilst into her hull they packed all the tar and pitch and brimstone\nthat they could find in the town, to which they added six barrels of\ngunpowder, placed on end like guns at the open ports on her larboard\nside. On the evening of the fourth day, everything being now in\nreadiness, all were got aboard, and the empty, pleasant city of\nMaracaybo was at last abandoned. But they did not weigh anchor until\nsome two hours after midnight. Then, at last, on the first of the ebb,\nthey drifted silently down towards the bar with all canvas furled save\nonly their spiltsails, which, so as to give them steering way, were\nspread to the faint breeze that stirred through the purple darkness of\nthe tropical night.\n\nThe order of their going was as follows: Ahead went the improvised\nfire-ship in charge of Wolverstone, with a crew of six volunteers, each\nof whom was to have a hundred pieces of eight over and above his share\nof plunder as a special reward. Next came the Arabella. She was followed\nat a distance by the Elizabeth, commanded by Hagthorpe, with whom was\nthe now shipless Cahusac and the bulk of his French followers. The rear\nwas brought up by the second sloop and some eight canoes, aboard of\nwhich had been shipped the prisoners, the slaves, and most of the\ncaptured merchandise. The prisoners were all pinioned, and guarded by\nfour buccaneers with musketoons who manned these boats in addition to\nthe two fellows who were to sail them. Their place was to be in the rear\nand they were to take no part whatever in the coming fight.\n\nAs the first glimmerings of opalescent dawn dissolved the darkness, the\nstraining eyes of the buccaneers were able to make out the tall rigging\nof the Spanish vessels, riding at anchor less than a quarter of a mile\nahead. Entirely without suspicion as the Spaniards were, and rendered\nconfident by their own overwhelming strength, it is unlikely that they\nused a vigilance keener than their careless habit. Certain it is that\nthey did not sight Blood's fleet in that dim light until some time\nafter Blood's fleet had sighted them. By the time that they had actively\nroused themselves, Wolverstone's sloop was almost upon them, speeding\nunder canvas which had been crowded to her yards the moment the galleons\nhad loomed into view.\n\nStraight for the Admiral's great ship, the Encarnacion, did Wolverstone\nhead the sloop; then, lashing down the helm, he kindled from a match\nthat hung ready lighted beside him a great torch of thickly plaited\nstraw that had been steeped in bitumen. First it glowed, then as he\nswung it round his head, it burst into flame, just as the slight vessel\nwent crashing and bumping and scraping against the side of the flagship,\nwhilst rigging became tangled with rigging, to the straining of yards\nand snapping of spars overhead. His six men stood at their posts on the\nlarboard side, stark naked, each armed with a grapnel, four of them on\nthe gunwale, two of them aloft. At the moment of impact these grapnels\nwere slung to bind the Spaniard to them, those aloft being intended to\ncomplete and preserve the entanglement of the rigging.\n\nAboard the rudely awakened galleon all was confused hurrying, scurrying,\ntrumpeting, and shouting. At first there had been a desperately hurried\nattempt to get up the anchor; but this was abandoned as being already\ntoo late; and conceiving themselves on the point of being boarded,\nthe Spaniards stood to arms to ward off the onslaught. Its slowness in\ncoming intrigued them, being so different from the usual tactics of the\nbuccaneers. Further intrigued were they by the sight of the gigantic\nWolverstone speeding naked along his deck with a great flaming torch\nheld high. Not until he had completed his work did they begin to suspect\nthe truth--that he was lighting slow-matches--and then one of their\nofficers rendered reckless by panic ordered a boarding-party on to the\nshop.\n\nThe order came too late. Wolverstone had seen his six fellows drop\noverboard after the grapnels were fixed, and then had sped, himself,\nto the starboard gunwale. Thence he flung his flaming torch down the\nnearest gaping scuttle into the hold, and thereupon dived overboard in\nhis turn, to be picked up presently by the longboat from the Arabella.\nBut before that happened the sloop was a thing of fire, from which\nexplosions were hurling blazing combustibles aboard the Encarnacion, and\nlong tongues of flame were licking out to consume the galleon, beating\nback those daring Spaniards who, too late, strove desperately to cut her\nadrift.\n\nAnd whilst the most formidable vessel of the Spanish fleet was thus\nbeing put out of action at the outset, Blood had sailed in to open fire\nupon the Salvador. First athwart her hawse he had loosed a broadside\nthat had swept her decks with terrific effect, then going on and about,\nhe had put a second broadside into her hull at short range. Leaving her\nthus half-crippled, temporarily, at least, and keeping to his course,\nhe had bewildered the crew of the Infanta by a couple of shots from the\nchasers on his beak-head, then crashed alongside to grapple and board\nher, whilst Hagthorpe was doing the like by the San Felipe.\n\nAnd in all this time not a single shot had the Spaniards contrived to\nfire, so completely had they been taken by surprise, and so swift and\nparalyzing had been Blood's stroke.\n\nBoarded now and faced by the cold steel of the buccaneers, neither the\nSan Felipe nor the Infanta offered much resistance. The sight of their\nadmiral in flames, and the Salvador drifting crippled from the action,\nhad so utterly disheartened them that they accounted themselves\nvanquished, and laid down their arms.\n\nIf by a resolute stand the Salvador had encouraged the other two\nundamaged vessels to resistance, the Spaniards might well have\nretrieved the fortunes of the day. But it happened that the Salvador was\nhandicapped in true Spanish fashion by being the treasure-ship of the\nfleet, with plate on board to the value of some fifty thousand pieces.\nIntent above all upon saving this from falling into the hands of the\npirates, Don Miguel, who, with a remnant of his crew, had meanwhile\ntransferred himself aboard her, headed her down towards Palomas and the\nfort that guarded the passage. This fort the Admiral, in those days of\nwaiting, had taken the precaution secretly to garrison and rearm. For\nthe purpose he had stripped the fort of Cojero, farther out on the gulf,\nof its entire armament, which included some cannon-royal of more than\nordinary range and power.\n\nWith no suspicion of this, Captain Blood gave chase, accompanied by\nthe Infanta, which was manned now by a prize-crew under the command of\nYberville. The stern chasers of the Salvador desultorily returned the\npunishing fire of the pursuers; but such was the damage she, herself,\nsustained, that presently, coming under the guns of the fort, she began\nto sink, and finally settled down in the shallows with part of her hull\nabove water. Thence, some in boats and some by swimming, the Admiral got\nhis crew ashore on Palomas as best he could.\n\nAnd then, just as Captain Blood accounted the victory won, and that his\nway out of that trap to the open sea beyond lay clear, the fort suddenly\nrevealed its formidable and utterly unsuspected strength. With a roar\nthe cannons-royal proclaimed themselves, and the Arabella staggered\nunder a blow that smashed her bulwarks at the waist and scattered death\nand confusion among the seamen gathered there.\n\nHad not Pitt, her master, himself seized the whipstaff and put the helm\nhard over to swing her sharply off to starboard, she must have suffered\nstill worse from the second volley that followed fast upon the first.\n\nMeanwhile it had fared even worse with the frailer Infanta. Although\nhit by one shot only, this had crushed her larboard timbers on the\nwaterline, starting a leak that must presently have filled her, but for\nthe prompt action of the experienced Yberville in ordering her\nlarboard guns to be flung overboard. Thus lightened, and listing now\nto starboard, he fetched her about, and went staggering after the\nretreating Arabella, followed by the fire of the fort, which did them,\nhowever, little further damage.\n\nOut of range, at last, they lay to, joined by the Elizabeth and the San\nFelipe, to consider their position.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. THE DUPES\n\n\nIt was a crestfallen Captain Blood who presided over that hastily\nsummoned council held on the poop-deck of the Arabella in the brilliant\nmorning sunshine. It was, he declared afterwards, one of the bitterest\nmoments in his career. He was compelled to digest the fact that having\nconducted the engagement with a skill of which he might justly be proud,\nhaving destroyed a force so superior in ships and guns and men that Don\nMiguel de Espinosa had justifiably deemed it overwhelming, his victory\nwas rendered barren by three lucky shots from an unsuspected battery\nby which they had been surprised. And barren must their victory remain\nuntil they could reduce the fort that still remained to defend the\npassage.\n\nAt first Captain Blood was for putting his ships in order and making the\nattempt there and then. But the others dissuaded him from betraying an\nimpetuosity usually foreign to him, and born entirely of chagrin\nand mortification, emotions which will render unreasonable the most\nreasonable of men. With returning calm, he surveyed the situation. The\nArabella was no longer in case to put to sea; the Infanta was merely\nkept afloat by artifice, and the San Felipe was almost as sorely damaged\nby the fire she had sustained from the buccaneers before surrendering.\n\nClearly, then, he was compelled to admit in the end that nothing\nremained but to return to Maracaybo, there to refit the ships before\nattempting to force the passage.\n\nAnd so, back to Maracaybo came those defeated victors of that short,\nterrible fight. And if anything had been wanting further to exasperate\ntheir leader, he had it in the pessimism of which Cahusac did not\neconomize expressions. Transported at first to heights of dizzy\nsatisfaction by the swift and easy victory of their inferior force that\nmorning, the Frenchman was now plunged back and more deeply than ever\ninto the abyss of hopelessness. And his mood infected at least the main\nbody of his own followers.\n\n\"It is the end,\" he told Captain Blood. \"This time we are checkmated.\"\n\n\"I'll take the liberty of reminding you that you said the same before,\"\nCaptain Blood answered him as patiently as he could. \"Yet you've seen\nwhat you've seen, and you'll not deny that in ships and guns we are\nreturning stronger than we went. Look at our present fleet, man.\"\n\n\"I am looking at it,\" said Cahusac.\n\n\"Pish! Ye're a white-livered cur when all is said.\"\n\n\"You call me a coward?\"\n\n\"I'll take that liberty.\"\n\nThe Breton glared at him, breathing hard. But he had no mind to ask\nsatisfaction for the insult. He knew too well the kind of satisfaction\nthat Captain Blood was likely to afford him. He remembered the fate of\nLevasseur. So he confined himself to words.\n\n\"It is too much! You go too far!\" he complained bitterly.\n\n\"Look you, Cahusac: it's sick and tired I am of your perpetual whining\nand complaining when things are not as smooth as a convent dining-table.\nIf ye wanted things smooth and easy, ye shouldn't have taken to the sea,\nand ye should never ha' sailed with me, for with me things are never\nsmooth and easy. And that, I think, is all I have to say to you this\nmorning.\"\n\nCahusac flung away cursing, and went to take the feeling of his men.\n\nCaptain Blood went off to give his surgeon's skill to the wounded, among\nwhom he remained engaged until late afternoon. Then, at last, he went\nashore, his mind made up, and returned to the house of the Governor, to\nindite a truculent but very scholarly letter in purest Castilian to Don\nMiguel.\n\n\"I have shown your excellency this morning of what I am capable,\" he\nwrote. \"Although outnumbered by more than two to one in men, in ships,\nand in guns, I have sunk or captured the vessels of the great fleet with\nwhich you were to come to Maracaybo to destroy us. So that you are no\nlonger in case to carry out your boast, even when your reenforcements\non the Santo Nino, reach you from La Guayra. From what has occurred, you\nmay judge of what must occur. I should not trouble your excellency with\nthis letter but that I am a humane man, abhorring bloodshed. Therefore\nbefore proceeding to deal with your fort, which you may deem invincible,\nas I have dealt already with your fleet, which you deemed invincible, I\nmake you, purely out of humanitarian considerations, this last offer of\nterms. I will spare this city of Maracaybo and forthwith evacuate it,\nleaving behind me the forty prisoners I have taken, in consideration of\nyour paying me the sum of fifty thousand pieces of eight and one hundred\nhead of cattle as a ransom, thereafter granting me unmolested passage of\nthe bar. My prisoners, most of whom are persons of consideration, I will\nretain as hostages until after my departure, sending them back in the\ncanoes which we shall take with us for that purpose. If your excellency\nshould be so ill-advised as to refuse these terms, and thereby impose\nupon me the necessity of reducing your fort at the cost of some lives, I\nwarn you that you may expect no quarter from us, and that I shall begin\nby leaving a heap of ashes where this pleasant city of Maracaybo now\nstands.\"\n\nThe letter written, he bade them bring him from among the prisoners\nthe Deputy-Governor of Maracaybo, who had been taken at Gibraltar.\nDisclosing its contents to him, he despatched him with it to Don Miguel.\n\nHis choice of a messenger was shrewd. The Deputy-Governor was of all men\nthe most anxious for the deliverance of his city, the one man who on his\nown account would plead most fervently for its preservation at all costs\nfrom the fate with which Captain Blood was threatening it. And as he\nreckoned so it befell. The Deputy-Governor added his own passionate\npleading to the proposals of the letter.\n\nBut Don Miguel was of stouter heart. True, his fleet had been partly\ndestroyed and partly captured. But then, he argued, he had been taken\nutterly by surprise. That should not happen again. There should be no\nsurprising the fort. Let Captain Blood do his worst at Maracaybo, there\nshould be a bitter reckoning for him when eventually he decided--as,\nsooner or later, decide he must--to come forth. The Deputy-Governor was\nflung into panic. He lost his temper, and said some hard things to the\nAdmiral. But they were not as hard as the thing the Admiral said to him\nin answer.\n\n\"Had you been as loyal to your King in hindering the entrance of these\ncursed pirates as I shall be in hindering their going forth again, we\nshould not now find ourselves in our present straits. So weary me no\nmore with your coward counsels. I make no terms with Captain Blood. I\nknow my duty to my King, and I intend to perform it. I also know my\nduty to myself. I have a private score with this rascal, and I intend to\nsettle it. Take you that message back.\"\n\nSo back to Maracaybo, back to his own handsome house in which Captain\nBlood had established his quarters, came the Deputy-Governor with the\nAdmiral's answer. And because he had been shamed into a show of spirit\nby the Admiral's own stout courage in adversity, he delivered it as\ntruculently as the Admiral could have desired. \"And is it like that?\"\nsaid Captain Blood with a quiet smile, though the heart of him sank\nat this failure of his bluster. \"Well, well, it's a pity now that the\nAdmiral's so headstrong. It was that way he lost his fleet, which was\nhis own to lose. This pleasant city of Maracaybo isn't. So no doubt\nhe'll lose it with fewer misgivings. I am sorry. Waste, like bloodshed,\nis a thing abhorrent to me. But there ye are! I'll have the faggots to\nthe place in the morning, and maybe when he sees the blaze to-morrow\nnight he'll begin to believe that Peter Blood is a man of his word. Ye\nmay go, Don Francisco.\"\n\nThe Deputy-Governor went out with dragging feet, followed by guards, his\nmomentary truculence utterly spent.\n\nBut no sooner had he departed than up leapt Cahusac, who had been of the\ncouncil assembled to receive the Admiral's answer. His face was white\nand his hands shook as he held them out in protest.\n\n\"Death of my life, what have you to say now?\" he cried, his voice husky.\nAnd without waiting to hear what it might be, he raved on: \"I knew you\nnot frighten the Admiral so easy. He hold us entrap', and he knows it;\nyet you dream that he will yield himself to your impudent message. Your\nfool letter it have seal' the doom of us all.\"\n\n\"Have ye done?\" quoth Blood quietly, as the Frenchman paused for breath.\n\n\"No, I have not.\"\n\n\"Then spare me the rest. It'll be of the same quality, devil a doubt,\nand it doesn't help us to solve the riddle that's before us.\"\n\n\"But what are you going to do? Is it that you will tell me?\" It was not\na question, it was a demand.\n\n\"How the devil do I know? I was hoping you'd have some ideas yourself.\nBut since Ye're so desperately concerned to save your skin, you and\nthose that think like you are welcome to leave us. I've no doubt at all\nthe Spanish Admiral will welcome the abatement of our numbers even at\nthis late date. Ye shall have the sloop as a parting gift from us, and\nye can join Don Miguel in the fort for all I care, or for all the good\nye're likely to be to us in this present pass.\"\n\n\"It is to my men to decide,\" Cahusac retorted, swallowing his fury, and\non that stalked out to talk to them, leaving the others to deliberate in\npeace.\n\nNext morning early he sought Captain Blood again. He found him alone\nin the patio, pacing to and fro, his head sunk on his breast. Cahusac\nmistook consideration for dejection. Each of us carries in himself a\nstandard by which to measure his neighbour.\n\n\"We have take' you at your word, Captain,\" he announced, between\nsullenness and defiance. Captain Blood paused, shoulders hunched, hands\nbehind his back, and mildly regarded the buccaneer in silence. Cahusac\nexplained himself. \"Last night I send one of my men to the Spanish\nAdmiral with a letter. I make him offer to capitulate if he will accord\nus passage with the honours of war. This morning I receive his answer.\nHe accord us this on the understanding that we carry nothing away with\nus. My men they are embarking them on the sloop. We sail at once.\"\n\n\"Bon voyage,\" said Captain Blood, and with a nod he turned on his heel\nagain to resume his interrupted mediation.\n\n\"Is that all that you have to say to me?\" cried Cahusac.\n\n\"There are other things,\" said Blood over his shoulder. \"But I know ye\nwouldn't like them.\"\n\n\"Ha! Then it's adieu, my Captain.\" Venomously he added: \"It is my belief\nthat we shall not meet again.\"\n\n\"Your belief is my hope,\" said Captain Blood.\n\nCahusac flung away, obscenely vituperative. Before noon he was under way\nwith his followers, some sixty dejected men who had allowed themselves\nto be persuaded by him into that empty-handed departure--in spite even\nof all that Yberville could do to prevent it. The Admiral kept faith\nwith him, and allowed him free passage out to sea, which, from his\nknowledge of Spaniards, was more than Captain Blood had expected.\n\nMeanwhile, no sooner had the deserters weighed anchor than Captain Blood\nreceived word that the Deputy-Governor begged to be allowed to see him\nagain. Admitted, Don Francisco at once displayed the fact that a night's\nreflection had quickened his apprehensions for the city of Maracaybo and\nhis condemnation of the Admiral's intransigence.\n\nCaptain Blood received him pleasantly.\n\n\"Good-morning to you, Don Francisco. I have postponed the bonfire until\nnightfall. It will make a better show in the dark.\"\n\nDon Francisco, a slight, nervous, elderly man of high lineage and low\nvitality, came straight to business.\n\n\"I am here to tell you, Don Pedro, that if you will hold your hand for\nthree days, I will undertake to raise the ransom you demand, which Don\nMiguel de Espinosa refuses.\"\n\nCaptain Blood confronted him, a frown contracting the dark brows above\nhis light eyes:\n\n\"And where will you be raising it?\" quoth he, faintly betraying his\nsurprise.\n\nDon Francisco shook his head. \"That must remain my affair,\" he answered.\n\"I know where it is to be found, and my compatriots must contribute.\nGive me leave for three days on parole, and I will see you fully\nsatisfied. Meanwhile my son remains in your hands as a hostage for my\nreturn.\" And upon that he fell to pleading. But in this he was crisply\ninterrupted.\n\n\"By the Saints! Ye're a bold man, Don Francisco, to come to me with such\na tale--to tell me that ye know where the ransom's to be raised, and yet\nto refuse to say. D'ye think now that with a match between your fingers\nye'd grow more communicative?\"\n\nIf Don Francisco grew a shade paler, yet again he shook his head.\n\n\"That was the way of Morgan and L'Ollonais and other pirates. But it is\nnot the way of Captain Blood. If I had doubted that I should not have\ndisclosed so much.\"\n\nThe Captain laughed. \"You old rogue,\" said he. \"Ye play upon my vanity,\ndo you?\"\n\n\"Upon your honour, Captain.\"\n\n\"The honour of a pirate? Ye're surely crazed!\"\n\n\"The honour of Captain Blood,\" Don Francisco insisted. \"You have the\nrepute of making war like a gentleman.\"\n\nCaptain Blood laughed again, on a bitter, sneering note that made Don\nFrancisco fear the worst. He was not to guess that it was himself the\nCaptain mocked.\n\n\"That's merely because it's more remunerative in the end. And that\nis why you are accorded the three days you ask for. So about it, Don\nFrancisco. You shall have what mules you need. I'll see to it.\"\n\nAway went Don Francisco on his errand, leaving Captain Blood to reflect,\nbetween bitterness and satisfaction, that a reputation for as much\nchivalry as is consistent with piracy is not without its uses.\n\nPunctually on the third day the Deputy-Governor was back in Maracaybo\nwith his mules laden with plate and money to the value demanded and a\nherd of a hundred head of cattle driven in by negro slaves.\n\nThese bullocks were handed over to those of the company who ordinarily\nwere boucan-hunters, and therefore skilled in the curing of meats, and\nfor best part of a week thereafter they were busy at the waterside with\nthe quartering and salting of carcases.\n\nWhile this was doing on the one hand and the ships were being refitted\nfor sea on the other, Captain Blood was pondering the riddle on the\nsolution of which his own fate depended. Indian spies whom he employed\nbrought him word that the Spaniards, working at low tide, had salved the\nthirty guns of the Salvador, and thus had added yet another battery\nto their already overwhelming strength. In the end, and hoping for\ninspiration on the spot, Captain Blood made a reconnaissance in person.\nAt the risk of his life, accompanied by two friendly Indians, he crossed\nto the island in a canoe under cover of dark. They concealed themselves\nand the canoe in the short thick scrub with which that side of the\nisland was densely covered, and lay there until daybreak. Then Blood\nwent forward alone, and with infinite precaution, to make his survey. He\nwent to verify a suspicion that he had formed, and approached the fort\nas nearly as he dared and a deal nearer than was safe.\n\nOn all fours he crawled to the summit of an eminence a mile or so away,\nwhence he found himself commanding a view of the interior dispositions\nof the stronghold. By the aid of a telescope with which he had equipped\nhimself he was able to verify that, as he had suspected and hoped, the\nfort's artillery was all mounted on the seaward side.\n\nSatisfied, he returned to Maracaybo, and laid before the six who\ncomposed his council--Pitt, Hagthorpe, Yberville, Wolverstone, Dyke, and\nOgle--a proposal to storm the fort from the landward side. Crossing\nto the island under cover of night, they would take the Spaniards by\nsurprise and attempt to overpower them before they could shift their\nguns to meet the onslaught.\n\nWith the exception of Wolverstone, who was by temperament the kind of\nman who favours desperate chances, those officers received the proposal\ncoldly. Hagthorpe incontinently opposed it.\n\n\"It's a harebrained scheme, Peter,\" he said gravely, shaking his\nhandsome head. \"Consider now that we cannot depend upon approaching\nunperceived to a distance whence we might storm the fort before the\ncannon could be moved. But even if we could, we can take no cannon\nourselves; we must depend entirely upon our small arms, and how shall\nwe, a bare three hundred\" (for this was the number to which Cahusac's\ndefection had reduced them), \"cross the open to attack more than twice\nthat number under cover?\"\n\nThe others--Dyke, Ogle, Yberville, and even Pitt, whom loyalty to Blood\nmay have made reluctant--loudly approved him. When they had done, \"I\nhave considered all,\" said Captain Blood. \"I have weighed the risks and\nstudied how to lessen them. In these desperate straits....\"\n\nHe broke off abruptly. A moment he frowned, deep in thought; then his\nface was suddenly alight with inspiration. Slowly he drooped his head,\nand sat there considering, weighing, chin on breast. Then he nodded,\nmuttering, \"Yes,\" and again, \"Yes.\" He looked up, to face them.\n\"Listen,\" he cried. \"You may be right. The risks may be too heavy.\nWhether or not, I have thought of a better way. That which should have\nbeen the real attack shall be no more than a feint. Here, then, is the\nplan I now propose.\"\n\nHe talked swiftly and clearly, and as he talked one by one his officers'\nfaces became alight with eagerness. When he had done, they cried as with\none voice that he had saved them.\n\n\"That is yet to be proved in action,\" said he.\n\nSince for the last twenty-four hours all had been in readiness for\ndeparture, there was nothing now to delay them, and it was decided to\nmove next morning.\n\nSuch was Captain Blood's assurance of success that he immediately freed\nthe prisoners held as hostages, and even the negro slaves, who were\nregarded by the others as legitimate plunder. His only precaution\nagainst those released prisoners was to order them into the church\nand there lock them up, to await deliverance at the hands of those who\nshould presently be coming into the city.\n\nThen, all being aboard the three ships, with the treasure safely stowed\nin their holds and the slaves under hatches, the buccaneers weighed\nanchor and stood out for the bar, each vessel towing three piraguas\nastern.\n\nThe Admiral, beholding their stately advance in the full light of noon,\ntheir sails gleaming white in the glare of the sunlight, rubbed his\nlong, lean hands in satisfaction, and laughed through his teeth.\n\n\"At last!\" he cried. \"God delivers him into my hands!\" He turned to the\ngroup of staring officers behind him. \"Sooner or later it had to be,\" he\nsaid. \"Say now, gentlemen, whether I am justified of my patience. Here\nend to-day the troubles caused to the subjects of the Catholic King by\nthis infamous Don Pedro Sangre, as he once called himself to me.\"\n\nHe turned to issue orders, and the fort became lively as a hive. The\nguns were manned, the gunners already kindling fuses, when the buccaneer\nfleet, whilst still heading for Palomas, was observed to bear away to\nthe west. The Spaniards watched them, intrigued.\n\nWithin a mile and a half to westward of the fort, and within a half-mile\nof the shore--that is to say, on the very edge of the shoal water that\nmakes Palomas unapproachable on either side by any but vessels of\nthe shallowest draught--the four ships cast anchor well within the\nSpaniards' view, but just out of range of their heaviest cannon.\n\nSneeringly the Admiral laughed.\n\n\"Aha! They hesitate, these English dogs! Por Dios, and well they may.\"\n\n\"They will be waiting for night,\" suggested his nephew, who stood at his\nelbow quivering with excitement.\n\nDon Miguel looked at him, smiling. \"And what shall the night avail them\nin this narrow passage, under the very muzzles of my guns? Be sure,\nEsteban, that to-night your father will be paid for.\"\n\nHe raised his telescope to continue his observation of the buccaneers.\nHe saw that the piraguas towed by each vessel were being warped\nalongside, and he wondered a little what this manoeuver might portend.\nAwhile those piraguas were hidden from view behind the hulls. Then one\nby one they reappeared, rowing round and away from the ships, and each\nboat, he observed, was crowded with armed men. Thus laden, they were\nheaded for the shore, at a point where it was densely wooded to the\nwater's edge. The eyes of the wondering Admiral followed them until the\nfoliage screened them from his view.\n\nThen he lowered his telescope and looked at his officers.\n\n\"What the devil does it mean?\" he asked.\n\nNone answered him, all being as puzzled as he was himself.\n\nAfter a little while, Esteban, who kept his eyes on the water, plucked\nat his uncle's sleeve. \"There they go!\" he cried, and pointed.\n\nAnd there, indeed, went the piraguas on their way back to the ships.\nBut now it was observed that they were empty, save for the men who rowed\nthem. Their armed cargo had been left ashore.\n\nBack to the ships they pulled, to return again presently with a fresh\nload of armed men, which similarly they conveyed to Palomas. And at last\none of the Spanish officers ventured an explanation:\n\n\"They are going to attack us by land--to attempt to storm the fort.\"\n\n\"Of course.\" The Admiral smiled. \"I had guessed it. Whom the gods would\ndestroy they first make mad.\"\n\n\"Shall we make a sally?\" urged Esteban, in his excitement.\n\n\"A sally? Through that scrub? That would be to play into their hands.\nNo, no, we will wait here to receive this attack. Whenever it comes, it\nis themselves will be destroyed, and utterly. Have no doubt of that.\"\n\nBut by evening the Admiral's equanimity was not quite so perfect. By\nthen the piraguas had made a half-dozen journeys with their loads\nof men, and they had landed also--as Don Miguel had clearly observed\nthrough his telescope--at least a dozen guns.\n\nHis countenance no longer smiled; it was a little wrathful and a little\ntroubled now as he turned again to his officers.\n\n\"Who was the fool who told me that they number but three hundred men in\nall? They have put at least twice that number ashore already.\"\n\nAmazed as he was, his amazement would have been deeper had he been told\nthe truth: that there was not a single buccaneer or a single gun ashore\non Palomas. The deception had been complete. Don Miguel could not guess\nthat the men he had beheld in those piraguas were always the same; that\non the journeys to the shore they sat and stood upright in full view;\nand that on the journeys back to the ships, they lay invisible at the\nbottom of the boats, which were thus made to appear empty.\n\nThe growing fears of the Spanish soldiery at the prospect of a night\nattack from the landward side by the entire buccaneer force--and a\nforce twice as strong as they had suspected the pestilent Blood to\ncommand--began to be communicated to the Admiral.\n\nIn the last hours of fading daylight, the Spaniards did precisely what\nCaptain Blood so confidently counted that they would do--precisely what\nthey must do to meet the attack, preparations for which had been so\nthoroughly simulated. They set themselves to labour like the damned at\nthose ponderous guns emplaced to command the narrow passage out to sea.\n\nGroaning and sweating, urged on by the curses and even the whips of\ntheir officers, they toiled in a frenzy of panic-stricken haste to shift\nthe greater number and the more powerful of their guns across to the\nlandward side, there to emplace them anew, so that they might be ready\nto receive the attack which at any moment now might burst upon them from\nthe woods not half a mile away.\n\nThus, when night fell, although in mortal anxiety of the onslaught of\nthose wild devils whose reckless courage was a byword on the seas of the\nMain, at least the Spaniards were tolerably prepared for it. Waiting,\nthey stood to their guns.\n\nAnd whilst they waited thus, under cover of the darkness and as the tide\nbegan to ebb, Captain Blood's fleet weighed anchor quietly; and, as once\nbefore, with no more canvas spread than that which their sprits could\ncarry, so as to give them steering way--and even these having been\npainted black--the four vessels, without a light showing, groped their\nway by soundings to the channel which led to that narrow passage out to\nsea.\n\nThe Elizabeth and the Infanta, leading side by side, were almost abreast\nof the fort before their shadowy bulks and the soft gurgle of water at\ntheir prows were detected by the Spaniards, whose attention until that\nmoment had been all on the other side. And now there arose on the night\nair such a sound of human baffled fury as may have resounded about Babel\nat the confusion of tongues. To heighten that confusion, and to scatter\ndisorder among the Spanish soldiery, the Elizabeth emptied her larboard\nguns into the fort as she was swept past on the swift ebb.\n\nAt once realizing--though not yet how--he had been duped, and that his\nprey was in the very act of escaping after all, the Admiral frantically\nordered the guns that had been so laboriously moved to be dragged back\nto their former emplacements, and commanded his gunners meanwhile to\nthe slender batteries that of all his powerful, but now unavailable,\narmament still remained trained upon the channel. With these, after the\nloss of some precious moments, the fort at last made fire.\n\nIt was answered by a terrific broadside from the Arabella, which had\nnow drawn abreast, and was crowding canvas to her yards. The enraged\nand gibbering Spaniards had a brief vision of her as the line of flame\nspurted from her red flank, and the thunder of her broadside drowned\nthe noise of the creaking halyards. After that they saw her no more.\nAssimilated by the friendly darkness which the lesser Spanish guns were\nspeculatively stabbing, the escaping ships fired never another shot that\nmight assist their baffled and bewildered enemies to locate them.\n\nSome slight damage was sustained by Blood's fleet. But by the time the\nSpaniards had resolved their confusion into some order of dangerous\noffence, that fleet, well served by a southerly breeze, was through the\nnarrows and standing out to sea.\n\nThus was Don Miguel de Espinosa left to chew the bitter cud of a lost\nopportunity, and to consider in what terms he would acquaint the\nSupreme Council of the Catholic King that Peter Blood had got away from\nMaracaybo, taking with him two twenty-gun frigates that were lately\nthe property of Spain, to say nothing of two hundred and fifty thousand\npieces of eight and other plunder. And all this in spite of Don Miguel's\nfour galleons and his heavily armed fort that at one time had held the\npirates so securely trapped.\n\nHeavy, indeed, grew the account of Peter Blood, which Don Miguel swore\npassionately to Heaven should at all costs to himself be paid in full.\n\nNor were the losses already detailed the full total of those suffered\non this occasion by the King of Spain. For on the following evening,\noff the coast of Oruba, at the mouth of the Gulf of Venezuela, Captain\nBlood's fleet came upon the belated Santo Nino, speeding under full sail\nto reenforce Don Miguel at Maracaybo.\n\nAt first the Spaniard had conceived that she was meeting the victorious\nfleet of Don Miguel, returning from the destruction of the pirates. When\nat comparatively close quarters the pennon of St. George soared to the\nArabella's masthead to disillusion her, the Santo Nino chose the better\npart of valour, and struck her flag.\n\nCaptain Blood ordered her crew to take to the boats, and land themselves\nat Oruba or wherever else they pleased. So considerate was he that to\nassist them he presented them with several of the piraguas which he\nstill had in tow.\n\n\"You will find,\" said he to her captain, \"that Don Miguel is in an\nextremely bad temper. Commend me to him, and say that I venture to\nremind him that he must blame himself for all the ills that have\nbefallen him. The evil has recoiled upon him which he loosed when\nhe sent his brother unofficially to make a raid upon the island of\nBarbados. Bid him think twice before he lets his devils loose upon an\nEnglish settlement again.\"\n\nWith that he dismissed the Captain, who went over the side of the Santo\nNino, and Captain Blood proceeded to investigate the value of this\nfurther prize. When her hatches were removed, a human cargo was\ndisclosed in her hold.\n\n\"Slaves,\" said Wolverstone, and persisted in that belief cursing Spanish\ndevilry until Cahusac crawled up out of the dark bowels of the ship, and\nstood blinking in the sunlight.\n\nThere was more than sunlight to make the Breton pirate blink. And\nthose that crawled out after him--the remnants of his crew--cursed him\nhorribly for the pusillanimity which had brought them into the ignominy\nof owing their deliverance to those whom they had deserted as lost\nbeyond hope.\n\nTheir sloop had encountered and had been sunk three days ago by the\nSanto Nino, and Cahusac had narrowly escaped hanging merely that for\nsome time he might be a mock among the Brethren of the Coast.\n\nFor many a month thereafter he was to hear in Tortuga the jeering taunt:\n\n\"Where do you spend the gold that you brought back from Maracaybo?\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. THE MILAGROSA\n\n\nThe affair at Maracaybo is to be considered as Captain Blood's\nbuccaneering masterpiece. Although there is scarcely one of the many\nactions that he fought--recorded in such particular detail by Jeremy\nPitt--which does not afford some instance of his genius for naval\ntactics, yet in none is this more shiningly displayed than in those two\nengagements by which he won out of the trap which Don Miguel de Espinosa\nhad sprung upon him.\n\nThe fame which he had enjoyed before this, great as it already was, is\ndwarfed into insignificance by the fame that followed. It was a fame\nsuch as no buccaneer--not even Morgan--has ever boasted, before or\nsince.\n\nIn Tortuga, during the months he spent there refitting the three ships\nhe had captured from the fleet that had gone out to destroy him, he\nfound himself almost an object of worship in the eyes of the wild\nBrethren of the Coast, all of whom now clamoured for the honour of\nserving under him. It placed him in the rare position of being able\nto pick and choose the crews for his augmented fleet, and he chose\nfastidiously. When next he sailed away it was with a fleet of five fine\nships in which went something over a thousand men. Thus you behold him\nnot merely famous, but really formidable. The three captured Spanish\nvessels he had renamed with a certain scholarly humour the Clotho,\nLachesis, and Atropos, a grimly jocular manner of conveying to the world\nthat he made them the arbiters of the fate of any Spaniards he should\nhenceforth encounter upon the seas.\n\nIn Europe the news of this fleet, following upon the news of the Spanish\nAdmiral's defeat at Maracaybo, produced something of a sensation. Spain\nand England were variously and unpleasantly exercised, and if you care\nto turn up the diplomatic correspondence exchanged on the subject, you\nwill find that it is considerable and not always amiable.\n\nAnd meanwhile in the Caribbean, the Spanish Admiral Don Miguel de\nEspinosa might be said--to use a term not yet invented in his day--to\nhave run amok. The disgrace into which he had fallen as a result of the\ndisasters suffered at the hands of Captain Blood had driven the Admiral\nall but mad. It is impossible, if we impose our minds impartially,\nto withhold a certain sympathy from Don Miguel. Hate was now this\nunfortunate man's daily bread, and the hope of vengeance an obsession to\nhis mind. As a madman he went raging up and down the Caribbean seeking\nhis enemy, and in the meantime, as an hors d'oeuvre to his vindictive\nappetite, he fell upon any ship of England or of France that loomed\nabove his horizon.\n\nI need say no more to convey the fact that this illustrious sea-captain\nand great gentleman of Castile had lost his head, and was become a\npirate in his turn. The Supreme Council of Castile might anon condemn\nhim for his practices. But how should that matter to one who already was\ncondemned beyond redemption? On the contrary, if he should live to lay\nthe audacious and ineffable Blood by the heels, it was possible that\nSpain might view his present irregularities and earlier losses with a\nmore lenient eye.\n\nAnd so, reckless of the fact that Captain Blood was now in vastly\nsuperior strength, the Spaniard sought him up and down the trackless\nseas. But for a whole year he sought him vainly. The circumstances in\nwhich eventually they met are very curious.\n\nAn intelligent observation of the facts of human existence will reveal\nto shallow-minded folk who sneer at the use of coincidence in the arts\nof fiction and drama that life itself is little more than a series of\ncoincidences. Open the history of the past at whatsoever page you will,\nand there you shall find coincidence at work bringing about events that\nthe merest chance might have averted. Indeed, coincidence may be defined\nas the very tool used by Fate to shape the destinies of men and nations.\n\nObserve it now at work in the affairs of Captain Blood and of some\nothers.\n\nOn the 15th September of the year 1688--a memorable year in the annals\nof England--three ships were afloat upon the Caribbean, which in their\ncoming conjunctions were to work out the fortunes of several persons.\n\nThe first of these was Captain Blood's flagship the Arabella, which had\nbeen separated from the buccaneer fleet in a hurricane off the Lesser\nAntilles. In somewhere about 17 deg. N. Lat., and 74 deg. Long., she\nwas beating up for the Windward Passage, before the intermittent\nsoutheasterly breezes of that stifling season, homing for Tortuga, the\nnatural rendezvous of the dispersed vessels.\n\nThe second ship was the great Spanish galleon, the Milagrosa, which,\naccompanied by the smaller frigate Hidalga, lurked off the Caymites,\nto the north of the long peninsula that thrusts out from the southwest\ncorner of Hispaniola. Aboard the Milagrosa sailed the vindictive Don\nMiguel.\n\nThe third and last of these ships with which we are at present concerned\nwas an English man-of-war, which on the date I have given was at anchor\nin the French port of St. Nicholas on the northwest coast of Hispaniola.\nShe was on her way from Plymouth to Jamaica, and carried on board a\nvery distinguished passenger in the person of Lord Julian Wade, who\ncame charged by his kinsman, my Lord Sunderland, with a mission of\nsome consequence and delicacy, directly arising out of that vexatious\ncorrespondence between England and Spain.\n\nThe French Government, like the English, excessively annoyed by the\ndepredations of the buccaneers, and the constant straining of relations\nwith Spain that ensued, had sought in vain to put them down by enjoining\nthe utmost severity against them upon her various overseas governors.\nBut these, either--like the Governor of Tortuga--throve out of a\nscarcely tacit partnership with the filibusters, or--like the Governor\nof French Hispaniola--felt that they were to be encouraged as a check\nupon the power and greed of Spain, which might otherwise be exerted to\nthe disadvantage of the colonies of other nations. They looked, indeed,\nwith apprehension upon recourse to any vigorous measures which must\nresult in driving many of the buccaneers to seek new hunting-grounds in\nthe South Sea.\n\nTo satisfy King James's anxiety to conciliate Spain, and in response to\nthe Spanish Ambassador's constant and grievous expostulations, my Lord\nSunderland, the Secretary of State, had appointed a strong man to the\ndeputy-governorship of Jamaica. This strong man was that Colonel\nBishop who for some years now had been the most influential planter in\nBarbados.\n\nColonel Bishop had accepted the post, and departed from the plantations\nin which his great wealth was being amassed with an eagerness that had\nits roots in a desire to pay off a score of his own with Peter Blood.\n\nFrom his first coming to Jamaica, Colonel Bishop had made himself felt\nby the buccaneers. But do what he might, the one buccaneer whom he\nmade his particular quarry--that Peter Blood who once had been his\nslave--eluded him ever, and continued undeterred and in great force\nto harass the Spaniards upon sea and land, and to keep the relations\nbetween England and Spain in a state of perpetual ferment, particularly\ndangerous in those days when the peace of Europe was precariously\nmaintained.\n\nExasperated not only by his own accumulated chagrin, but also by the\nreproaches for his failure which reached him from London, Colonel Bishop\nactually went so far as to consider hunting his quarry in Tortuga\nitself and making an attempt to clear the island of the buccaneers it\nsheltered. Fortunately for himself, he abandoned the notion of so insane\nan enterprise, deterred not only by the enormous natural strength of the\nplace, but also by the reflection that a raid upon what was, nominally\nat least, a French settlement, must be attended by grave offence to\nFrance. Yet short of some such measure, it appeared to Colonel Bishop\nthat he was baffled. He confessed as much in a letter to the Secretary\nof State.\n\nThis letter and the state of things which it disclosed made my Lord\nSunderland despair of solving this vexatious problem by ordinary means.\nHe turned to the consideration of extraordinary ones, and bethought him\nof the plan adopted with Morgan, who had been enlisted into the King's\nservice under Charles II. It occurred to him that a similar course might\nbe similarly effective with Captain Blood. His lordship did not omit\nthe consideration that Blood's present outlawry might well have been\nundertaken not from inclination, but under stress of sheer necessity;\nthat he had been forced into it by the circumstances of his\ntransportation, and that he would welcome the opportunity of emerging\nfrom it.\n\nActing upon this conclusion, Sunderland sent out his kinsman, Lord\nJulian Wade, with some commissions made out in blank, and full\ndirections as to the course which the Secretary considered it desirable\nto pursue and yet full discretion in the matter of pursuing them. The\ncrafty Sunderland, master of all labyrinths of intrigue, advised his\nkinsman that in the event of his finding Blood intractable, or judging\nfor other reasons that it was not desirable to enlist him in the King's\nservice, he should turn his attention to the officers serving under him,\nand by seducing them away from him leave him so weakened that he must\nfall an easy victim to Colonel Bishop's fleet.\n\nThe Royal Mary--the vessel bearing that ingenious, tolerably\naccomplished, mildly dissolute, entirely elegant envoy of my Lord\nSunderland's--made a good passage to St. Nicholas, her last port of\ncall before Jamaica. It was understood that as a preliminary Lord Julian\nshould report himself to the Deputy-Governor at Port Royal, whence at\nneed he might have himself conveyed to Tortuga. Now it happened that the\nDeputy-Governor's niece had come to St. Nicholas some months earlier on\na visit to some relatives, and so that she might escape the insufferable\nheat of Jamaica in that season. The time for her return being now at\nhand, a passage was sought for her aboard the Royal Mary, and in view of\nher uncle's rank and position promptly accorded.\n\nLord Julian hailed her advent with satisfaction. It gave a voyage that\nhad been full of interest for him just the spice that it required\nto achieve perfection as an experience. His lordship was one of your\ngallants to whom existence that is not graced by womankind is more or\nless of a stagnation. Miss Arabella Bishop--this straight up and down\nslip of a girl with her rather boyish voice and her almost boyish ease\nof movement--was not perhaps a lady who in England would have commanded\nmuch notice in my lord's discerning eyes. His very sophisticated,\ncarefully educated tastes in such matters inclined him towards the\nplump, the languishing, and the quite helplessly feminine. Miss\nBishop's charms were undeniable. But they were such that it would take a\ndelicate-minded man to appreciate them; and my Lord Julian, whilst of a\nmind that was very far from gross, did not possess the necessary degree\nof delicacy. I must not by this be understood to imply anything against\nhim.\n\nIt remained, however, that Miss Bishop was a young woman and a lady; and\nin the latitude into which Lord Julian had strayed this was a phenomenon\nsufficiently rare to command attention. On his side, with his title and\nposition, his personal grace and the charm of a practised courtier, he\nbore about him the atmosphere of the great world in which normally he\nhad his being--a world that was little more than a name to her, who had\nspent most of her life in the Antilles. It is not therefore wonderful\nthat they should have been attracted to each other before the Royal\nMary was warped out of St. Nicholas. Each could tell the other much upon\nwhich the other desired information. He could regale her imagination\nwith stories of St. James's--in many of which he assigned himself a\nheroic, or at least a distinguished part--and she could enrich his mind\nwith information concerning this new world to which he had come.\n\nBefore they were out of sight of St. Nicholas they were good friends,\nand his lordship was beginning to correct his first impressions of her\nand to discover the charm of that frank, straightforward attitude of\ncomradeship which made her treat every man as a brother. Considering\nhow his mind was obsessed with the business of his mission, it is not\nwonderful that he should have come to talk to her of Captain Blood.\nIndeed, there was a circumstance that directly led to it.\n\n\"I wonder now,\" he said, as they were sauntering on the poop, \"if\nyou ever saw this fellow Blood, who was at one time on your uncle's\nplantations as a slave.\"\n\nMiss Bishop halted. She leaned upon the taffrail, looking out towards\nthe receding land, and it was a moment before she answered in a steady,\nlevel voice:\n\n\"I saw him often. I knew him very well.\"\n\n\"Ye don't say!\" His lordship was slightly moved out of an\nimperturbability that he had studiously cultivated. He was a young man\nof perhaps eight-and-twenty, well above the middle height in stature\nand appearing taller by virtue of his exceeding leanness. He had a thin,\npale, rather pleasing hatchet-face, framed in the curls of a golden\nperiwig, a sensitive mouth and pale blue eyes that lent his countenance\na dreamy expression, a rather melancholy pensiveness. But they were\nalert, observant eyes notwithstanding, although they failed on this\noccasion to observe the slight change of colour which his question had\nbrought to Miss Bishop's cheeks or the suspiciously excessive composure\nof her answer.\n\n\"Ye don't say!\" he repeated, and came to lean beside her. \"And what\nmanner of man did you find him?\"\n\n\"In those days I esteemed him for an unfortunate gentleman.\"\n\n\"You were acquainted with his story?\"\n\n\"He told it me. That is why I esteemed him--for the calm fortitude with\nwhich he bore adversity. Since then, considering what he has done, I\nhave almost come to doubt if what he told me of himself was true.\"\n\n\"If you mean of the wrongs he suffered at the hands of the Royal\nCommission that tried the Monmouth rebels, there's little doubt that it\nwould be true enough. He was never out with Monmouth; that is certain.\nHe was convicted on a point of law of which he may well have been\nignorant when he committed what was construed into treason. But, faith,\nhe's had his revenge, after a fashion.\"\n\n\"That,\" she said in a small voice, \"is the unforgivable thing. It has\ndestroyed him--deservedly.\"\n\n\"Destroyed him?\" His lordship laughed a little. \"Be none so sure of\nthat. He has grown rich, I hear. He has translated, so it is said, his\nSpanish spoils into French gold, which is being treasured up for him in\nFrance. His future father-in-law, M. d'Ogeron, has seen to that.\"\n\n\"His future father-in-law?\" said she, and stared at him round-eyed, with\nparted lips. Then added: \"M. d'Ogeron? The Governor of Tortuga?\"\n\n\"The same. You see the fellow's well protected. It's a piece of news I\ngathered in St. Nicholas. I am not sure that I welcome it, for I am\nnot sure that it makes any easier a task upon which my kinsman, Lord\nSunderland, has sent me hither. But there it is. You didn't know?\"\n\nShe shook her head without replying. She had averted her face, and her\neyes were staring down at the gently heaving water. After a moment she\nspoke, her voice steady and perfectly controlled.\n\n\"But surely, if this were true, there would have been an end to his\npiracy by now. If he... if he loved a woman and was betrothed, and was\nalso rich as you say, surely he would have abandoned this desperate\nlife, and...\"\n\n\"Why, so I thought,\" his lordship interrupted, \"until I had the\nexplanation. D'Ogeron is avaricious for himself and for his child. And\nas for the girl, I'm told she's a wild piece, fit mate for such a man as\nBlood. Almost I marvel that he doesn't marry her and take her a-roving\nwith him. It would be no new experience for her. And I marvel, too, at\nBlood's patience. He killed a man to win her.\"\n\n\"He killed a man for her, do you say?\" There was horror now in her\nvoice.\n\n\"Yes--a French buccaneer named Levasseur. He was the girl's lover and\nBlood's associate on a venture. Blood coveted the girl, and killed\nLevasseur to win her. Pah! It's an unsavoury tale, I own. But men live\nby different codes out in these parts....\"\n\nShe had turned to face him. She was pale to the lips, and her hazel eyes\nwere blazing, as she cut into his apologies for Blood.\n\n\"They must, indeed, if his other associates allowed him to live after\nthat.\"\n\n\"Oh, the thing was done in fair fight, I am told.\"\n\n\"Who told you?\"\n\n\"A man who sailed with them, a Frenchman named Cahusac, whom I found in\na waterside tavern in St. Nicholas. He was Levasseur's lieutenant,\nand he was present on the island where the thing happened, and when\nLevasseur was killed.\"\n\n\"And the girl? Did he say the girl was present, too?\"\n\n\"Yes. She was a witness of the encounter. Blood carried her off when he\nhad disposed of his brother-buccaneer.\"\n\n\"And the dead man's followers allowed it?\" He caught the note of\nincredulity in her voice, but missed the note of relief with which it\nwas blent. \"Oh, I don't believe the tale. I won't believe it!\"\n\n\"I honour you for that, Miss Bishop. It strained my own belief that men\nshould be so callous, until this Cahusac afforded me the explanation.\"\n\n\"What?\" She checked her unbelief, an unbelief that had uplifted her from\nan inexplicable dismay. Clutching the rail, she swung round to face his\nlordship with that question. Later he was to remember and perceive in\nher present behaviour a certain oddness which went disregarded now.\n\n\"Blood purchased their consent, and his right to carry the girl off. He\npaid them in pearls that were worth more than twenty thousand pieces of\neight.\" His lordship laughed again with a touch of contempt. \"A handsome\nprice! Faith, they're scoundrels all--just thieving, venal curs. And\nfaith, it's a pretty tale this for a lady's ear.\"\n\nShe looked away from him again, and found that her sight was blurred.\nAfter a moment in a voice less steady than before she asked him:\n\n\"Why should this Frenchman have told you such a tale? Did he hate this\nCaptain Blood?\"\n\n\"I did not gather that,\" said his lordship slowly. \"He related it... oh,\njust as a commonplace, an instance of buccaneering ways.\n\n\"A commonplace!\" said she. \"My God! A commonplace!\"\n\n\"I dare say that we are all savages under the cloak that civilization\nfashions for us,\" said his lordship. \"But this Blood, now, was a man\nof considerable parts, from what else this Cahusac told me. He was a\nbachelor of medicine.\"\n\n\"That is true, to my own knowledge.\"\n\n\"And he has seen much foreign service on sea and land. Cahusac\nsaid--though this I hardly credit--that he had fought under de Ruyter.\"\n\n\"That also is true,\" said she. She sighed heavily. \"Your Cahusac seems\nto have been accurate enough. Alas!\"\n\n\"You are sorry, then?\"\n\nShe looked at him. She was very pale, he noticed.\n\n\"As we are sorry to hear of the death of one we have esteemed. Once I\nheld him in regard for an unfortunate but worthy gentleman. Now....\"\n\nShe checked, and smiled a little crooked smile. \"Such a man is best\nforgotten.\"\n\nAnd upon that she passed at once to speak of other things. The\nfriendship, which it was her great gift to command in all she met, grew\nsteadily between those two in the little time remaining, until the event\nbefell that marred what was promising to be the pleasantest stage of his\nlordship's voyage.\n\nThe marplot was the mad-dog Spanish Admiral, whom they encountered on\nthe second day out, when halfway across the Gulf of Gonaves. The Captain\nof the Royal Mary was not disposed to be intimidated even when Don\nMiguel opened fire on him. Observing the Spaniard's plentiful seaboard\ntowering high above the water and offering him so splendid a mark,\nthe Englishman was moved to scorn. If this Don who flew the banner of\nCastile wanted a fight, the Royal Mary was just the ship to oblige him.\nIt may be that he was justified of his gallant confidence, and that\nhe would that day have put an end to the wild career of Don Miguel de\nEspinosa, but that a lucky shot from the Milagrosa got among some powder\nstored in his forecastle, and blew up half his ship almost before the\nfight had started. How the powder came there will never now be known,\nand the gallant Captain himself did not survive to enquire into it.\n\nBefore the men of the Royal Mary had recovered from their consternation,\ntheir captain killed and a third of their number destroyed with him, the\nship yawing and rocking helplessly in a crippled state, the Spaniards\nboarded her.\n\nIn the Captain's cabin under the poop, to which Miss Bishop had been\nconducted for safety, Lord Julian was seeking to comfort and encourage\nher, with assurances that all would yet be well, at the very moment when\nDon Miguel was stepping aboard. Lord Julian himself was none so steady,\nand his face was undoubtedly pale. Not that he was by any means a\ncoward. But this cooped-up fighting on an unknown element in a thing of\nwood that might at any moment founder under his feet into the depths\nof ocean was disturbing to one who could be brave enough ashore.\nFortunately Miss Bishop did not appear to be in desperate need of the\npoor comfort he was in case to offer. Certainly she, too, was pale, and\nher hazel eyes may have looked a little larger than usual. But she had\nherself well in hand. Half sitting, half leaning on the Captain's table,\nshe preserved her courage sufficiently to seek to calm the octoroon\nwaiting-woman who was grovelling at her feet in a state of terror.\n\nAnd then the cabin-door flew open, and Don Miguel himself, tall,\nsunburned, and aquiline of face, strode in. Lord Julian span round, to\nface him, and clapped a hand to his sword.\n\nThe Spaniard was brisk and to the point.\n\n\"Don't be a fool,\" he said in his own tongue, \"or you'll come by a\nfool's end. Your ship is sinking.\"\n\nThere were three or four men in morions behind Don Miguel, and Lord\nJulian realized the position. He released his hilt, and a couple of\nfeet or so of steel slid softly back into the scabbard. But Don Miguel\nsmiled, with a flash of white teeth behind his grizzled beard, and held\nout his hand.\n\n\"If you please,\" he said.\n\nLord Julian hesitated. His eyes strayed to Miss Bishop's. \"I think you\nhad better,\" said that composed young lady, whereupon with a shrug his\nlordship made the required surrender.\n\n\"Come you--all of you--aboard my ship,\" Don Miguel invited them, and\nstrode out.\n\nThey went, of course. For one thing the Spaniard had force to compel\nthem; for another a ship which he announced to be sinking offered them\nlittle inducement to remain. They stayed no longer than was necessary to\nenable Miss Bishop to collect some spare articles of dress and my lord\nto snatch up his valise.\n\nAs for the survivors in that ghastly shambles that had been the Royal\nMary, they were abandoned by the Spaniards to their own resources. Let\nthem take to the boats, and if those did not suffice them, let them swim\nor drown. If Lord Julian and Miss Bishop were retained, it was because\nDon Miguel perceived their obvious value. He received them in his cabin\nwith great urbanity. Urbanely he desired to have the honour of being\nacquainted with their names.\n\nLord Julian, sick with horror of the spectacle he had just witnessed,\ncommanded himself with difficulty to supply them. Then haughtily he\ndemanded to know in his turn the name of their aggressor. He was in\nan exceedingly ill temper. He realized that if he had done nothing\npositively discreditable in the unusual and difficult position into\nwhich Fate had thrust him, at least he had done nothing creditable.\nThis might have mattered less but that the spectator of his indifferent\nperformance was a lady. He was determined if possible to do better now.\n\n\"I am Don Miguel de Espinosa,\" he was answered. \"Admiral of the Navies\nof the Catholic King.\"\n\nLord Julian gasped. If Spain made such a hubbub about the depredations\nof a runagate adventurer like Captain Blood, what could not England\nanswer now?\n\n\"Will you tell me, then, why you behave like a damned pirate?\" he asked.\nAnd added: \"I hope you realize what will be the consequences, and the\nstrict account to which you shall be brought for this day's work, for\nthe blood you have murderously shed, and for your violence to this lady\nand to myself.\"\n\n\"I offer you no violence,\" said the Admiral, smiling, as only the man\nwho holds the trumps can smile. \"On the contrary, I have saved your\nlives....\"\n\n\"Saved our lives!\" Lord Julian was momentarily speechless before such\ncallous impudence. \"And what of the lives you have destroyed in wanton\nbutchery? By God, man, they shall cost you dear.\"\n\nDon Miguel's smile persisted. \"It is possible. All things are possible.\nMeantime it is your own lives that will cost you dear. Colonel Bishop is\na rich man; and you, milord, are no doubt also rich. I will consider and\nfix your ransom.\"\n\n\"So that you're just the damned murderous pirate I was supposing you,\"\nstormed his lordship. \"And you have the impudence to call yourself\nthe Admiral of the Navies of the Catholic King? We shall see what your\nCatholic King will have to say to it.\"\n\nThe Admiral ceased to smile. He revealed something of the rage that had\neaten into his brain. \"You do not understand,\" he said. \"It is that I\ntreat you English heretic dogs just as you English heretic dogs have\ntreated Spaniards upon the seas--you robbers and thieves out of hell!\nI have the honesty to do it in my own name--but you, you perfidious\nbeasts, you send your Captain Bloods, your Hagthorpes, and your Morgans\nagainst us and disclaim responsibility for what they do. Like Pilate,\nyou wash your hands.\" He laughed savagely. \"Let Spain play the part of\nPilate. Let her disclaim responsibility for me, when your ambassador\nat the Escurial shall go whining to the Supreme Council of this act of\npiracy by Don Miguel de Espinosa.\"\n\n\"Captain Blood and the rest are not admirals of England!\" cried Lord\nJulian.\n\n\"Are they not? How do I know? How does Spain know? Are you not liars\nall, you English heretics?\"\n\n\"Sir!\" Lord Julian's voice was harsh as a rasp, his eyes flashed.\nInstinctively he swung a hand to the place where his sword habitually\nhung. Then he shrugged and sneered: \"Of course,\" said he, \"it sorts with\nall I have heard of Spanish honour and all that I have seen of yours\nthat you should insult a man who is unarmed and your prisoner.\"\n\nThe Admiral's face flamed scarlet. He half raised his hand to strike.\nAnd then, restrained, perhaps, by the very words that had cloaked the\nretorting insult, he turned on his heel abruptly and went out without\nanswering.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. THE MEETING\n\n\nAs the door slammed after the departing Admiral, Lord Julian turned to\nArabella, and actually smiled. He felt that he was doing better, and\ngathered from it an almost childish satisfaction--childish in all the\ncircumstances. \"Decidedly I think I had the last word there,\" he said,\nwith a toss of his golden ringlets.\n\nMiss Bishop, seated at the cabin-table, looked at him steadily, without\nreturning his smile. \"Does it matter, then, so much, having the last\nword? I am thinking of those poor fellows on the Royal Mary. Many of\nthem have had their last word, indeed. And for what? A fine ship sunk,\na score of lives lost, thrice that number now in jeopardy, and all for\nwhat?\"\n\n\"You are overwrought, ma'am. I....\"\n\n\"Overwrought!\" She uttered a single sharp note of laughter. \"I assure\nyou I am calm. I am asking you a question, Lord Julian. Why has this\nSpaniard done all this? To what purpose?\"\n\n\"You heard him.\" Lord Julian shrugged angrily. \"Blood-lust,\" he\nexplained shortly.\n\n\"Blood-lust?\" she asked. She was amazed. \"Does such a thing exist, then?\nIt is insane, monstrous.\"\n\n\"Fiendish,\" his lordship agreed. \"Devil's work.\"\n\n\"I don't understand. At Bridgetown three years ago there was a Spanish\nraid, and things were done that should have been impossible to men,\nhorrible, revolting things which strain belief, which seem, when I\nthink of them now, like the illusions of some evil dream. Are men just\nbeasts?\"\n\n\"Men?\" said Lord Julian, staring. \"Say Spaniards, and I'll agree.\"\nHe was an Englishman speaking of hereditary foes. And yet there was a\nmeasure of truth in what he said. \"This is the Spanish way in the New\nWorld. Faith, almost it justifies such men as Blood of what they do.\"\n\nShe shivered, as if cold, and setting her elbows on the table, she took\nher chin in her hands, and sat staring before her.\n\nObserving her, his lordship noticed how drawn and white her face had\ngrown. There was reason enough for that, and for worse. Not any other\nwoman of his acquaintance would have preserved her self-control in such\nan ordeal; and of fear, at least, at no time had Miss Bishop shown any\nsign. It is impossible that he did not find her admirable.\n\nA Spanish steward entered bearing a silver chocolate service and a box\nof Peruvian candies, which he placed on the table before the lady.\n\n\"With the Admiral's homage,\" he said, then bowed, and withdrew.\n\nMiss Bishop took no heed of him or his offering, but continued to stare\nbefore her, lost in thought. Lord Julian took a turn in the long low\ncabin, which was lighted by a skylight above and great square windows\nastern. It was luxuriously appointed: there were rich Eastern rugs on\nthe floor, well-filled bookcases stood against the bulkheads, and there\nwas a carved walnut sideboard laden with silverware. On a long, low\nchest standing under the middle stern port lay a guitar that was gay\nwith ribbons. Lord Julian picked it up, twanged the strings once as if\nmoved by nervous irritation, and put it down.\n\nHe turned again to face Miss Bishop.\n\n\"I came out here,\" he said, \"to put down piracy. But--blister me!--I\nbegin to think that the French are right in desiring piracy to continue\nas a curb upon these Spanish scoundrels.\"\n\nHe was to be strongly confirmed in that opinion before many hours\nwere past. Meanwhile their treatment at the hands of Don Miguel was\nconsiderate and courteous. It confirmed the opinion, contemptuously\nexpressed to his lordship by Miss Bishop, that since they were to be\nheld to ransom they need not fear any violence or hurt. A cabin was\nplaced at the disposal of the lady and her terrified woman, and another\nat Lord Julian's. They were given the freedom of the ship, and bidden to\ndine at the Admiral's table; nor were his further intentions regarding\nthem mentioned, nor yet his immediate destination.\n\nThe Milagrosa, with her consort the Hidalga rolling after her, steered\na south by westerly course, then veered to the southeast round Cape\nTiburon, and thereafter, standing well out to sea, with the land no more\nthan a cloudy outline to larboard, she headed directly east, and so ran\nstraight into the arms of Captain Blood, who was making for the Windward\nPassage, as we know. That happened early on the following morning. After\nhaving systematically hunted his enemy in vain for a year, Don Miguel\nchanced upon him in this unexpected and entirely fortuitous fashion. But\nthat is the ironic way of Fortune. It was also the way of Fortune that\nDon Miguel should thus come upon the Arabella at a time when, separated\nfrom the rest of the fleet, she was alone and at a disadvantage. It\nlooked to Don Miguel as if the luck which so long had been on Blood's\nside had at last veered in his own favour.\n\nMiss Bishop, newly risen, had come out to take the air on the\nquarter-deck with his lordship in attendance--as you would expect of so\ngallant a gentleman--when she beheld the big red ship that had once been\nthe Cinco Llagas out of Cadiz. The vessel was bearing down upon them,\nher mountains of snowy canvas bellying forward, the long pennon with\nthe cross of St. George fluttering from her main truck in the morning\nbreeze, the gilded portholes in her red hull and the gilded beak-head\naflash in the morning sun.\n\nMiss Bishop was not to recognize this for that same Cinco Llagas which\nshe had seen once before--on a tragic day in Barbados three years\nago. To her it was just a great ship that was heading resolutely,\nmajestically, towards them, and an Englishman to judge by the pennon\nshe was flying. The sight thrilled her curiously; it awoke in her an\nuplifting sense of pride that took no account of the danger to herself\nin the encounter that must now be inevitable.\n\nBeside her on the poop, whither they had climbed to obtain a better\nview, and equally arrested and at gaze, stood Lord Julian. But he shared\nnone of her exultation. He had been in his first sea-fight yesterday,\nand he felt that the experience would suffice him for a very\nconsiderable time. This, I insist, is no reflection upon his courage.\n\n\"Look,\" said Miss Bishop, pointing; and to his infinite amazement he\nobserved that her eyes were sparkling. Did she realize, he wondered,\nwhat was afoot? Her next sentence resolved his doubt. \"She is English,\nand she comes resolutely on. She means to fight.\"\n\n\"God help her, then,\" said his lordship gloomily. \"Her captain must be\nmad. What can he hope to do against two such heavy hulks as these? If\nthey could so easily blow the Royal Mary out of the water, what will\nthey do to this vessel? Look at that devil Don Miguel. He's utterly\ndisgusting in his glee.\"\n\nFrom the quarter-deck, where he moved amid the frenzy of preparation,\nthe Admiral had turned to flash a backward glance at his prisoners. His\neyes were alight, his face transfigured. He flung out an arm to point\nto the advancing ship, and bawled something in Spanish that was lost to\nthem in the noise of the labouring crew.\n\nThey advanced to the poop-rail, and watched the bustle. Telescope in\nhand on the quarter-deck, Don Miguel was issuing his orders. Already the\ngunners were kindling their matches; sailors were aloft, taking in sail;\nothers were spreading a stout rope net above the waist, as a protection\nagainst falling spars. And meanwhile Don Miguel had been signalling to\nhis consort, in response to which the Hidalga had drawn steadily\nforward until she was now abeam of the Milagrosa, half cable's length to\nstarboard, and from the height of the tall poop my lord and Miss Bishop\ncould see her own bustle of preparation. And they could discern signs of\nit now aboard the advancing English ship as well. She was furling tops\nand mainsail, stripping in fact to mizzen and sprit for the coming\naction. Thus, almost silently without challenge or exchange of signals,\nhad action been mutually determined.\n\nOf necessity now, under diminished sail, the advance of the Arabella was\nslower; but it was none the less steady. She was already within saker\nshot, and they could make out the figures stirring on her forecastle and\nthe brass guns gleaming on her prow. The gunners of the Milagrosa raised\ntheir linstocks and blew upon their smouldering matches, looking up\nimpatiently at the Admiral.\n\nBut the Admiral solemnly shook his head.\n\n\"Patience,\" he exhorted them. \"Save your fire until we have him. He is\ncoming straight to his doom--straight to the yardarm and the rope that\nhave been so long waiting for him.\"\n\n\"Stab me!\" said his lordship. \"This Englishman may be gallant enough to\naccept battle against such odds. But there are times when discretion is\na better quality than gallantry in a commander.\"\n\n\"Gallantry will often win through, even against overwhelming strength,\"\nsaid Miss Bishop. He looked at her, and noted in her bearing only\nexcitement. Of fear he could still discern no trace. His lordship was\npast amazement. She was not by any means the kind of woman to which life\nhad accustomed him.\n\n\"Presently,\" he said, \"you will suffer me to place you under cover.\"\n\n\"I can see best from here,\" she answered him. And added quietly: \"I am\npraying for this Englishman. He must be very brave.\"\n\nUnder his breath Lord Julian damned the fellow's bravery.\n\nThe Arabella was advancing now along a course which, if continued, must\ncarry her straight between the two Spanish ships. My lord pointed\nit out. \"He's crazy surely!\" he cried. \"He's driving straight into a\ndeath-trap. He'll be crushed to splinters between the two. No wonder\nthat black-faced Don is holding his fire. In his place, I should do the\nsame.\"\n\nBut even at that moment the Admiral raised his hand; in the waist, below\nhim, a trumpet blared, and immediately the gunner on the prow touched\noff his guns. As the thunder of them rolled out, his lordship saw ahead\nbeyond the English ship and to larboard of her two heavy splashes.\nAlmost at once two successive spurts of flame leapt from the brass\ncannon on the Arabella's beak-head, and scarcely had the watchers on the\npoop seen the shower of spray, where one of the shots struck the\nwater near them, then with a rending crash and a shiver that shook the\nMilagrosa from stem to stern, the other came to lodge in her forecastle.\nTo avenge that blow, the Hidalga blazed at the Englishman with both\nher forward guns. But even at that short range--between two and three\nhundred yards--neither shot took effect.\n\nAt a hundred yards the Arabella's forward guns, which had meanwhile\nbeen reloaded, fired again at the Milagrosa, and this time smashed her\nbowsprit into splinters; so that for a moment she yawed wildly to port.\nDon Miguel swore profanely, and then, as the helm was put over to swing\nher back to her course, his own prow replied. But the aim was too high,\nand whilst one of the shots tore through the Arabella's shrouds and\nscarred her mainmast, the other again went wide. And when the smoke of\nthat discharge had lifted, the English ship was found almost between the\nSpaniards, her bows in line with theirs and coming steadily on into what\nhis lordship deemed a death-trap.\n\nLord Julian held his breath, and Miss Bishop gasped, clutching the\nrail before her. She had a glimpse of the wickedly grinning face of Don\nMiguel, and the grinning faces of the men at the guns in the waist.\n\nAt last the Arabella was right between the Spanish ships prow to poop\nand poop to prow. Don Miguel spoke to the trumpeter, who had mounted the\nquarter-deck and stood now at the Admiral's elbow. The man raised the\nsilver bugle that was to give the signal for the broadsides of both\nships. But even as he placed it to his lips, the Admiral seized his arm,\nto arrest him. Only then had he perceived what was so obvious--or should\nhave been to an experienced sea-fighter: he had delayed too long and\nCaptain Blood had outmanoeuvred him. In attempting to fire now upon the\nEnglishman, the Milagrosa and her consort would also be firing into each\nother. Too late he ordered his helmsman to put the tiller hard over and\nswing the ship to larboard, as a preliminary to manoeuvring for a less\nimpossible position of attack. At that very moment the Arabella seemed\nto explode as she swept by. Eighteen guns from each of her flanks\nemptied themselves at that point-blank range into the hulls of the two\nSpanish vessels.\n\nHalf stunned by that reverberating thunder, and thrown off her balance\nby the sudden lurch of the ship under her feet, Miss Bishop hurtled\nviolently against Lord Julian, who kept his feet only by clutching\nthe rail on which he had been leaning. Billowing clouds of smoke to\nstarboard blotted out everything, and its acrid odour, taking them\npresently in the throat, set them gasping and coughing.\n\nFrom the grim confusion and turmoil in the waist below arose a clamour\nof fierce Spanish blasphemies and the screams of maimed men. The\nMilagrosa staggered slowly ahead, a gaping rent in her bulwarks; her\nforemast was shattered, fragments of the yards hanging in the netting\nspread below. Her beak-head was in splinters, and a shot had smashed\nthrough into the great cabin, reducing it to wreckage.\n\nDon Miguel was bawling orders wildly, and peering ever and anon through\nthe curtain of smoke that was drifting slowly astern, in his anxiety to\nascertain how it might have fared with the Hidalga.\n\nSuddenly, and ghostly at first through that lifting haze, loomed the\noutline of a ship; gradually the lines of her red hull became more and\nmore sharply defined as she swept nearer with poles all bare save for\nthe spread of canvas on her sprit.\n\nInstead of holding to her course as Don Miguel had expected she would,\nthe Arabella had gone about under cover of the smoke, and sailing now\nin the same direction as the Milagrosa, was converging sharply upon her\nacross the wind, so sharply that almost before the frenzied Don Miguel\nhad realized the situation, his vessel staggered under the rending\nimpact with which the other came hurtling alongside. There was a rattle\nand clank of metal as a dozen grapnels fell, and tore and caught in the\ntimbers of the Milagrosa, and the Spaniard was firmly gripped in the\ntentacles of the English ship.\n\nBeyond her and now well astern the veil of smoke was rent at last and\nthe Hidalga was revealed in desperate case. She was bilging fast, with\nan ominous list to larboard, and it could be no more than a question of\nmoments before she settled down. The attention of her hands was being\nentirely given to a desperate endeavour to launch the boats in time.\n\nOf this Don Miguel's anguished eyes had no more than a fleeting but\ncomprehensive glimpse before his own decks were invaded by a wild,\nyelling swarm of boarders from the grappling ship. Never was confidence\nso quickly changed into despair, never was hunter more swiftly converted\ninto helpless prey. For helpless the Spaniards were. The swiftly\nexecuted boarding manoeuvre had caught them almost unawares in the\nmoment of confusion following the punishing broadside they had sustained\nat such short range. For a moment there was a valiant effort by some\nof Don Miguel's officers to rally the men for a stand against these\ninvaders. But the Spaniards, never at their best in close-quarter\nfighting, were here demoralized by knowledge of the enemies with whom\nthey had to deal. Their hastily formed ranks were smashed before they\ncould be steadied; driven across the waist to the break of the poop\non the one side, and up to the forecastle bulkheads on the other, the\nfighting resolved itself into a series of skirmishes between groups. And\nwhilst this was doing above, another horde of buccaneers swarmed through\nthe hatch to the main deck below to overpower the gun-crews at their\nstations there.\n\nOn the quarter deck, towards which an overwhelming wave of buccaneers\nwas sweeping, led by a one-eyed giant, who was naked to the waist, stood\nDon Miguel, numbed by despair and rage. Above and behind him on the\npoop, Lord Julian and Miss Bishop looked on, his lordship aghast at the\nfury of this cooped-up fighting, the lady's brave calm conquered at last\nby horror so that she reeled there sick and faint.\n\nSoon, however, the rage of that brief fight was spent. They saw the\nbanner of Castile come fluttering down from the masthead. A buccaneer\nhad slashed the halyard with his cutlass. The boarders were in\npossession, and on the upper deck groups of disarmed Spaniards stood\nhuddled now like herded sheep.\n\nSuddenly Miss Bishop recovered from her nausea, to lean forward staring\nwild-eyed, whilst if possible her cheeks turned yet a deadlier hue than\nthey had been already.\n\nPicking his way daintily through that shambles in the waist came a tall\nman with a deeply tanned face that was shaded by a Spanish headpiece. He\nwas armed in back-and-breast of black steel beautifully damascened with\ngolden arabesques. Over this, like a stole, he wore a sling of scarlet\nsilk, from each end of which hung a silver-mounted pistol. Up the broad\ncompanion to the quarter-deck he came, toying with easy assurance, until\nhe stood before the Spanish Admiral. Then he bowed stiff and formally.\nA crisp, metallic voice, speaking perfect Spanish, reached those two\nspectators on the poop, and increased the admiring wonder in which Lord\nJulian had observed the man's approach.\n\n\"We meet again at last, Don Miguel,\" it said. \"I hope you are satisfied.\nAlthough the meeting may not be exactly as you pictured it, at least it\nhas been very ardently sought and desired by you.\"\n\nSpeechless, livid of face, his mouth distorted and his breathing\nlaboured, Don Miguel de Espinosa received the irony of that man to whom\nhe attributed his ruin and more beside. Then he uttered an inarticulate\ncry of rage, and his hand swept to his sword. But even as his fingers\nclosed upon the hilt, the other's closed upon his wrist to arrest the\naction.\n\n\"Calm, Don Miguel!\" he was quietly but firmly enjoined. \"Do not\nrecklessly invite the ugly extremes such as you would, yourself, have\npractised had the situation been reversed.\"\n\nA moment they stood looking into each other's eyes.\n\n\"What do you intend by me?\" the Spaniard enquired at last, his voice\nhoarse.\n\nCaptain Blood shrugged. The firm lips smiled a little. \"All that I\nintend has been already accomplished. And lest it increase your rancour,\nI beg you to observe that you have brought it entirely upon yourself.\nYou would have it so.\" He turned and pointed to the boats, which his men\nwere heaving from the boom amidships. \"Your boats are being launched.\nYou are at liberty to embark in them with your men before we scuttle\nthis ship. Yonder are the shores of Hispaniola. You should make them\nsafely. And if you'll take my advice, sir, you'll not hunt me again.\nI think I am unlucky to you. Get you home to Spain, Don Miguel, and to\nconcerns that you understand better than this trade of the sea.\"\n\nFor a long moment the defeated Admiral continued to stare his hatred\nin silence, then, still without speaking, he went down the companion,\nstaggering like a drunken man, his useless rapier clattering behind him.\nHis conqueror, who had not even troubled to disarm him, watched him go,\nthen turned and faced those two immediately above him on the poop. Lord\nJulian might have observed, had he been less taken up with other things,\nthat the fellow seemed suddenly to stiffen, and that he turned pale\nunder his deep tan. A moment he stood at gaze; then suddenly and swiftly\nhe came up the steps. Lord Julian stood forward to meet him.\n\n\"Ye don't mean, sir, that you'll let that Spanish scoundrel go free?\" he\ncried.\n\nThe gentleman in the black corselet appeared to become aware of his\nlordship for the first time.\n\n\"And who the devil may you be?\" he asked, with a marked Irish accent.\n\"And what business may it be of yours, at all?\"\n\nHis lordship conceived that the fellow's truculence and utter lack\nof proper deference must be corrected. \"I am Lord Julian Wade,\" he\nannounced, with that object.\n\nApparently the announcement made no impression.\n\n\"Are you, indeed! Then perhaps ye'll explain what the plague you're\ndoing aboard this ship?\"\n\nLord Julian controlled himself to afford the desired explanation. He did\nso shortly and impatiently.\n\n\"He took you prisoner, did he--along with Miss Bishop there?\"\n\n\"You are acquainted with Miss Bishop?\" cried his lordship, passing from\nsurprise to surprise.\n\nBut this mannerless fellow had stepped past him, and was making a leg\nto the lady, who on her side remained unresponsive and forbidding to\nthe point of scorn. Observing this, he turned to answer Lord Julian's\nquestion.\n\n\"I had that honour once,\" said he. \"But it seems that Miss Bishop has a\nshorter memory.\"\n\nHis lips were twisted into a wry smile, and there was pain in the blue\neyes that gleamed so vividly under his black brows, pain blending with\nthe mockery of his voice. But of all this it was the mockery alone that\nwas perceived by Miss Bishop; she resented it.\n\n\"I do not number thieves and pirates among my acquaintance, Captain\nBlood,\" said she; whereupon his lordship exploded in excitement.\n\n\"Captain Blood!\" he cried. \"Are you Captain Blood?\"\n\n\"What else were ye supposing?\"\n\nBlood asked the question wearily, his mind on other things. \"I do not\nnumber thieves and pirates among my acquaintance.\" The cruel phrase\nfilled his brain, reechoing and reverberating there.\n\nBut Lord Julian would not be denied. He caught him by the sleeve\nwith one hand, whilst with the other he pointed after the retreating,\ndejected figure of Don Miguel.\n\n\"Do I understand that ye're not going to hang that Spanish scoundrel?\"\n\n\"What for should I be hanging him?\"\n\n\"Because he's just a damned pirate, as I can prove, as I have proved\nalready.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Blood, and Lord Julian marvelled at the sudden haggardness of\na countenance that had been so devil-may-care but a few moments since.\n\"I am a damned pirate, myself; and so I am merciful with my kind. Don\nMiguel goes free.\"\n\nLord Julian gasped. \"After what I've told you that he has done? After\nhis sinking of the Royal Mary? After his treatment of me--of us?\" Lord\nJulian protested indignantly.\n\n\"I am not in the service of England, or of any nation, sir. And I am not\nconcerned with any wrongs her flag may suffer.\"\n\nHis lordship recoiled before the furious glance that blazed at him out\nof Blood's haggard face. But the passion faded as swiftly as it had\narisen. It was in a level voice that the Captain added:\n\n\"If you'll escort Miss Bishop aboard my ship, I shall be obliged to you.\nI beg that you'll make haste. We are about to scuttle this hulk.\"\n\nHe turned slowly to depart. But again Lord Julian interposed. Containing\nhis indignant amazement, his lordship delivered himself coldly. \"Captain\nBlood, you disappoint me. I had hopes of great things for you.\"\n\n\"Go to the devil,\" said Captain Blood, turning on his heel, and so\ndeparted.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. THIEF AND PIRATE\n\n\nCaptain Blood paced the poop of his ship alone in the tepid dusk, and\nthe growing golden radiance of the great poop lantern in which a seaman\nhad just lighted the three lamps. About him all was peace. The signs of\nthe day's battle had been effaced, the decks had been swabbed, and order\nwas restored above and below. A group of men squatting about the main\nhatch were drowsily chanting, their hardened natures softened, perhaps,\nby the calm and beauty of the night. They were the men of the larboard\nwatch, waiting for eight bells which was imminent.\n\nCaptain Blood did not hear them; he did not hear anything save the echo\nof those cruel words which had dubbed him thief and pirate.\n\nThief and pirate!\n\nIt is an odd fact of human nature that a man may for years possess the\nknowledge that a certain thing must be of a certain fashion, and yet be\nshocked to discover through his own senses that the fact is in perfect\nharmony with his beliefs. When first, three years ago, at Tortuga he\nhad been urged upon the adventurer's course which he had followed ever\nsince, he had known in what opinion Arabella Bishop must hold him if\nhe succumbed. Only the conviction that already she was for ever lost to\nhim, by introducing a certain desperate recklessness into his soul had\nsupplied the final impulse to drive him upon his rover's course.\n\nThat he should ever meet her again had not entered his calculations, had\nfound no place in his dreams. They were, he conceived, irrevocably and\nfor ever parted. Yet, in spite of this, in spite even of the persuasion\nthat to her this reflection that was his torment could bring no regrets,\nhe had kept the thought of her ever before him in all those wild years\nof filibustering. He had used it as a curb not only upon himself, but\nalso upon those who followed him. Never had buccaneers been so rigidly\nheld in hand, never had they been so firmly restrained, never so\ndebarred from the excesses of rapine and lust that were usual in their\nkind as those who sailed with Captain Blood. It was, you will remember,\nstipulated in their articles that in these as in other matters they must\nsubmit to the commands of their leader. And because of the singular good\nfortune which had attended his leadership, he had been able to impose\nthat stern condition of a discipline unknown before among buccaneers.\nHow would not these men laugh at him now if he were to tell them that\nthis he had done out of respect for a slip of a girl of whom he had\nfallen romantically enamoured? How would not that laughter swell if he\nadded that this girl had that day informed him that she did not number\nthieves and pirates among her acquaintance.\n\nThief and pirate!\n\nHow the words clung, how they stung and burnt his brain!\n\nIt did not occur to him, being no psychologist, nor learned in the\ntortuous workings of the feminine mind, that the fact that she should\nbestow upon him those epithets in the very moment and circumstance of\ntheir meeting was in itself curious. He did not perceive the problem\nthus presented; therefore he could not probe it. Else he might have\nconcluded that if in a moment in which by delivering her from captivity\nhe deserved her gratitude, yet she expressed herself in bitterness,\nit must be because that bitterness was anterior to the gratitude and\ndeep-seated. She had been moved to it by hearing of the course he had\ntaken. Why? It was what he did not ask himself, or some ray of light\nmight have come to brighten his dark, his utterly evil despondency.\nSurely she would never have been so moved had she not cared--had she not\nfelt that in what he did there was a personal wrong to herself. Surely,\nhe might have reasoned, nothing short of this could have moved her to\nsuch a degree of bitterness and scorn as that which she had displayed.\n\nThat is how you will reason. Not so, however, reasoned Captain Blood.\nIndeed, that night he reasoned not at all. His soul was given up to\nconflict between the almost sacred love he had borne her in all these\nyears and the evil passion which she had now awakened in him.\nExtremes touch, and in touching may for a space become confused,\nindistinguishable. And the extremes of love and hate were to-night so\nconfused in the soul of Captain Blood that in their fusion they made up\na monstrous passion.\n\nThief and pirate!\n\nThat was what she deemed him, without qualification, oblivious of\nthe deep wrongs he had suffered, the desperate case in which he found\nhimself after his escape from Barbados, and all the rest that had gone\nto make him what he was. That he should have conducted his filibustering\nwith hands as clean as were possible to a man engaged in such\nundertakings had also not occurred to her as a charitable thought with\nwhich to mitigate her judgment of a man she had once esteemed. She had\nno charity for him, no mercy. She had summed him up, convicted him and\nsentenced him in that one phrase. He was thief and pirate in her eyes;\nnothing more, nothing less. What, then, was she? What are those who have\nno charity? he asked the stars.\n\nWell, as she had shaped him hitherto, so let her shape him now. Thief\nand pirate she had branded him. She should be justified. Thief and\npirate should he prove henceforth; no more nor less; as bowelless, as\nremorseless, as all those others who had deserved those names. He would\ncast out the maudlin ideals by which he had sought to steer a course;\nput an end to this idiotic struggle to make the best of two worlds. She\nhad shown him clearly to which world he belonged. Let him now justify\nher. She was aboard his ship, in his power, and he desired her.\n\nHe laughed softly, jeeringly, as he leaned on the taffrail, looking down\nat the phosphorescent gleam in the ship's wake, and his own laughter\nstartled him by its evil note. He checked suddenly, and shivered. A sob\nbroke from him to end that ribald burst of mirth. He took his face in\nhis hands and found a chill moisture on his brow.\n\nMeanwhile, Lord Julian, who knew the feminine part of humanity rather\nbetter than Captain Blood, was engaged in solving the curious problem\nthat had so completely escaped the buccaneer. He was spurred to it, I\nsuspect, by certain vague stirrings of jealousy. Miss Bishop's conduct\nin the perils through which they had come had brought him at last\nto perceive that a woman may lack the simpering graces of cultured\nfemininity and yet because of that lack be the more admirable. He\nwondered what precisely might have been her earlier relations with\nCaptain Blood, and was conscious of a certain uneasiness which urged him\nnow to probe the matter.\n\nHis lordship's pale, dreamy eyes had, as I have said, a habit of\nobserving things, and his wits were tolerably acute.\n\nHe was blaming himself now for not having observed certain things\nbefore, or, at least, for not having studied them more closely, and he\nwas busily connecting them with more recent observations made that very\nday.\n\nHe had observed, for instance, that Blood's ship was named the Arabella,\nand he knew that Arabella was Miss Bishop's name. And he had observed\nall the odd particulars of the meeting of Captain Blood and Miss Bishop,\nand the curious change that meeting had wrought in each.\n\nThe lady had been monstrously uncivil to the Captain. It was a very\nfoolish attitude for a lady in her circumstances to adopt towards a man\nin Blood's; and his lordship could not imagine Miss Bishop as normally\nfoolish. Yet, in spite of her rudeness, in spite of the fact that she\nwas the niece of a man whom Blood must regard as his enemy, Miss Bishop\nand his lordship had been shown the utmost consideration aboard the\nCaptain's ship. A cabin had been placed at the disposal of each, to\nwhich their scanty remaining belongings and Miss Bishop's woman had been\nduly transferred. They were given the freedom of the great cabin, and\nthey had sat down to table with Pitt, the master, and Wolverstone, who\nwas Blood's lieutenant, both of whom had shown them the utmost courtesy.\nAlso there was the fact that Blood, himself, had kept almost studiously\nfrom intruding upon them.\n\nHis lordship's mind went swiftly but carefully down these avenues of\nthought, observing and connecting. Having exhausted them, he decided\nto seek additional information from Miss Bishop. For this he must wait\nuntil Pitt and Wolverstone should have withdrawn. He was hardly made to\nwait so long, for as Pitt rose from table to follow Wolverstone, who had\nalready departed, Miss Bishop detained him with a question:\n\n\"Mr. Pitt,\" she asked, \"were you not one of those who escaped from\nBarbados with Captain Blood?\"\n\n\"I was. I, too, was one of your uncle's slaves.\"\n\n\"And you have been with Captain Blood ever since?\"\n\n\"His shipmaster always, ma'am.\"\n\nShe nodded. She was very calm and self-contained; but his lordship\nobserved that she was unusually pale, though considering what she had\nthat day undergone this afforded no matter for wonder.\n\n\"Did you ever sail with a Frenchman named Cahusac?\"\n\n\"Cahusac?\" Pitt laughed. The name evoked a ridiculous memory. \"Aye. He\nwas with us at Maracaybo.\"\n\n\"And another Frenchman named Levasseur?\"\n\nHis lordship marvelled at her memory of these names.\n\n\"Aye. Cahusac was Levasseur's lieutenant, until he died.\"\n\n\"Until who died?\"\n\n\"Levasseur. He was killed on one of the Virgin Islands two years ago.\"\n\nThere was a pause. Then, in an even quieter voice than before, Miss\nBishop asked:\n\n\"Who killed him?\"\n\nPitt answered readily. There was no reason why he should not, though he\nbegan to find the catechism intriguing.\n\n\"Captain Blood killed him.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nPitt hesitated. It was not a tale for a maid's ears.\n\n\"They quarrelled,\" he said shortly.\n\n\"Was it about a... a lady?\" Miss Bishop relentlessly pursued him.\n\n\"You might put it that way.\"\n\n\"What was the lady's name?\"\n\nPitt's eyebrows went up; still he answered.\n\n\"Miss d'Ogeron. She was the daughter of the Governor of Tortuga. She had\ngone off with this fellow Levasseur, and... and Peter delivered her out\nof his dirty clutches. He was a black-hearted scoundrel, and deserved\nwhat Peter gave him.\"\n\n\"I see. And... and yet Captain Blood has not married her?\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" laughed Pitt, who knew the utter groundlessness of the common\ngossip in Tortuga which pronounced Mdlle. d'Ogeron the Captain's future\nwife.\n\nMiss Bishop nodded in silence, and Jeremy Pitt turned to depart,\nrelieved that the catechism was ended. He paused in the doorway to\nimpart a piece of information.\n\n\"Maybe it'll comfort you to know that the Captain has altered our course\nfor your benefit. It's his intention to put you both ashore on the coast\nof Jamaica, as near Port Royal as we dare venture. We've gone about, and\nif this wind holds ye'll soon be home again, mistress.\"\n\n\"Vastly obliging of him,\" drawled his lordship, seeing that Miss Bishop\nmade no shift to answer. Sombre-eyed she sat, staring into vacancy.\n\n\"Indeed, ye may say so,\" Pitt agreed. \"He's taking risks that few would\ntake in his place. But that's always been his way.\"\n\nHe went out, leaving his lordship pensive, those dreamy blue eyes of his\nintently studying Miss Bishop's face for all their dreaminess; his mind\nincreasingly uneasy. At length Miss Bishop looked at him, and spoke.\n\n\"Your Cahusac told you no more than the truth, it seems.\"\n\n\"I perceived that you were testing it,\" said his lordship. \"I am\nwondering precisely why.\"\n\nReceiving no answer, he continued to observe her silently, his long,\ntapering fingers toying with a ringlet of the golden periwig in which\nhis long face was set.\n\nMiss Bishop sat bemused, her brows knit, her brooding glance seeming\nto study the fine Spanish point that edged the tablecloth. At last his\nlordship broke the silence.\n\n\"He amazes me, this man,\" said he, in his slow, languid voice that never\nseemed to change its level. \"That he should alter his course for us\nis in itself matter for wonder; but that he should take a risk on our\nbehalf--that he should venture into Jamaica waters.... It amazes me, as\nI have said.\"\n\nMiss Bishop raised her eyes, and looked at him. She appeared to be very\nthoughtful. Then her lip flickered curiously, almost scornfully, it\nseemed to him. Her slender fingers drummed the table.\n\n\"What is still more amazing is that he does not hold us to ransom,\" said\nshe at last.\n\n\"It's what you deserve.\"\n\n\"Oh, and why, if you please?\"\n\n\"For speaking to him as you did.\"\n\n\"I usually call things by their names.\"\n\n\"Do you? Stab me! I shouldn't boast of it. It argues either extreme\nyouth or extreme foolishness.\" His lordship, you see, belonged to my\nLord Sunderland's school of philosophy. He added after a moment: \"So\ndoes the display of ingratitude.\"\n\nA faint colour stirred in her cheeks. \"Your lordship is evidently\naggrieved with me. I am disconsolate. I hope your lordship's grievance\nis sounder than your views of life. It is news to me that ingratitude is\na fault only to be found in the young and the foolish.\"\n\n\"I didn't say so, ma'am.\" There was a tartness in his tone evoked by\nthe tartness she had used. \"If you would do me the honour to listen,\nyou would not misapprehend me. For if unlike you I do not always say\nprecisely what I think, at least I say precisely what I wish to convey.\nTo be ungrateful may be human; but to display it is childish.\"\n\n\"I... I don't think I understand.\" Her brows were knit. \"How have I been\nungrateful and to whom?\"\n\n\"To whom? To Captain Blood. Didn't he come to our rescue?\"\n\n\"Did he?\" Her manner was frigid. \"I wasn't aware that he knew of our\npresence aboard the Milagrosa.\"\n\nHis lordship permitted himself the slightest gesture of impatience.\n\n\"You are probably aware that he delivered us,\" said he. \"And living as\nyou have done in these savage places of the world, you can hardly fail\nto be aware of what is known even in England: that this fellow Blood\nstrictly confines himself to making war upon the Spaniards. So that to\ncall him thief and pirate as you did was to overstate the case against\nhim at a time when it would have been more prudent to have understated\nit.\"\n\n\"Prudence?\" Her voice was scornful. \"What have I to do with prudence?\"\n\n\"Nothing--as I perceive. But, at least, study generosity. I tell you\nfrankly, ma'am, that in Blood's place I should never have been so nice.\nSink me! When you consider what he has suffered at the hands of his\nfellow-countrymen, you may marvel with me that he should trouble to\ndiscriminate between Spanish and English. To be sold into slavery! Ugh!\"\nHis lordship shuddered. \"And to a damned colonial planter!\" He checked\nabruptly. \"I beg your pardon, Miss Bishop. For the moment....\"\n\n\"You were carried away by your heat in defence of this... sea-robber.\"\nMiss Bishop's scorn was almost fierce.\n\nHis lordship stared at her again. Then he half-closed his large, pale\neyes, and tilted his head a little. \"I wonder why you hate him so,\" he\nsaid softly.\n\nHe saw the sudden scarlet flame upon her cheeks, the heavy frown that\ndescended upon her brow. He had made her very angry, he judged. But\nthere was no explosion. She recovered.\n\n\"Hate him? Lord! What a thought! I don't regard the fellow at all.\"\n\n\"Then ye should, ma'am.\" His lordship spoke his thought frankly. \"He's\nworth regarding. He'd be an acquisition to the King's navy--a man that\ncan do the things he did this morning. His service under de Ruyter\nwasn't wasted on him. That was a great seaman, and--blister me!--the\npupil's worthy the master if I am a judge of anything. I doubt if the\nRoyal Navy can show his equal. To thrust himself deliberately between\nthose two, at point-blank range, and so turn the tables on them! It asks\ncourage, resource, and invention. And we land-lubbers were not the only\nones he tricked by his manoeuvre. That Spanish Admiral never guessed the\nintent until it was too late and Blood held him in check. A great man,\nMiss Bishop. A man worth regarding.\"\n\nMiss Bishop was moved to sarcasm.\n\n\"You should use your influence with my Lord Sunderland to have the King\noffer him a commission.\"\n\nHis lordship laughed softly. \"Faith, it's done already. I have his\ncommission in my pocket.\" And he increased her amazement by a brief\nexposition of the circumstances. In that amazement he left her, and went\nin quest of Blood. But he was still intrigued. If she were a little less\nuncompromising in her attitude towards Blood, his lordship would have\nbeen happier.\n\nHe found the Captain pacing the quarter-deck, a man mentally exhausted\nfrom wrestling with the Devil, although of this particular occupation\nhis lordship could have no possible suspicion. With the amiable\nfamiliarity he used, Lord Julian slipped an arm through one of the\nCaptain's, and fell into step beside him.\n\n\"What's this?\" snapped Blood, whose mood was fierce and raw. His\nlordship was not disturbed.\n\n\"I desire, sir, that we be friends,\" said he suavely.\n\n\"That's mighty condescending of you!\"\n\nLord Julian ignored the obvious sarcasm.\n\n\"It's an odd coincidence that we should have been brought together in\nthis fashion, considering that I came out to the Indies especially to\nseek you.\"\n\n\"Ye're not by any means the first to do that,\" the other scoffed. \"But\nthey've mainly been Spaniards, and they hadn't your luck.\"\n\n\"You misapprehend me completely,\" said Lord Julian. And on that he\nproceeded to explain himself and his mission.\n\nWhen he had done, Captain Blood, who until that moment had stood\nstill under the spell of his astonishment, disengaged his arm from his\nlordship's, and stood squarely before him.\n\n\"Ye're my guest aboard this ship,\" said he, \"and I still have some\nnotion of decent behaviour left me from other days, thief and pirate\nthough I may be. So I'll not be telling you what I think of you for\ndaring to bring me this offer, or of my Lord Sunderland--since he's your\nkinsman for having the impudence to send it. But it does not surprise me\nat all that one who is a minister of James Stuart's should conceive\nthat every man is to be seduced by bribes into betraying those who trust\nhim.\" He flung out an arm in the direction of the waist, whence came the\nhalf-melancholy chant of the lounging buccaneers.\n\n\"Again you misapprehend me,\" cried Lord Julian, between concern and\nindignation. \"That is not intended. Your followers will be included in\nyour commission.\"\n\n\"And d' ye think they'll go with me to hunt their brethren--the\nBrethren of the Coast? On my soul, Lord Julian, it is yourself does the\nmisapprehending. Are there not even notions of honour left in England?\nOh, and there's more to it than that, even. D'ye think I could take a\ncommission of King James's? I tell you I wouldn't be soiling my hands\nwith it--thief and pirate's hands though they be. Thief and pirate is\nwhat you heard Miss Bishop call me to-day--a thing of scorn, an outcast.\nAnd who made me that? Who made me thief and pirate?\"\n\n\"If you were a rebel...?\" his lordship was beginning.\n\n\"Ye must know that I was no such thing--no rebel at all. It wasn't even\npretended. If it were, I could forgive them. But not even that cloak\ncould they cast upon their foulness. Oh, no; there was no mistake. I\nwas convicted for what I did, neither more nor less. That bloody vampire\nJeffreys--bad cess to him!--sentenced me to death, and his worthy master\nJames Stuart afterwards sent me into slavery, because I had performed an\nact of mercy; because compassionately and without thought for creed or\npolitics I had sought to relieve the sufferings of a fellow-creature;\nbecause I had dressed the wounds of a man who was convicted of treason.\nThat was all my offence. You'll find it in the records. And for that I\nwas sold into slavery: because by the law of England, as administered by\nJames Stuart in violation of the laws of God, who harbours or comforts\na rebel is himself adjudged guilty of rebellion. D'ye dream man, what it\nis to be a slave?\"\n\nHe checked suddenly at the very height of his passion. A moment he\npaused, then cast it from him as if it had been a cloak. His voice sank\nagain. He uttered a little laugh of weariness and contempt.\n\n\"But there! I grow hot for nothing at all. I explain myself, I think,\nand God knows, it is not my custom. I am grateful to you, Lord Julian,\nfor your kindly intentions. I am so. But ye'll understand, perhaps. Ye\nlook as if ye might.\"\n\nLord Julian stood still. He was deeply stricken by the other's words,\nthe passionate, eloquent outburst that in a few sharp, clear-cut strokes\nhad so convincingly presented the man's bitter case against humanity,\nhis complete apologia and justification for all that could be laid to\nhis charge. His lordship looked at that keen, intrepid face gleaming\nlividly in the light of the great poop lantern, and his own eyes were\ntroubled. He was abashed.\n\nHe fetched a heavy sigh. \"A pity,\" he said slowly. \"Oh, blister me--a\ncursed pity!\" He held out his hand, moved to it on a sudden generous\nimpulse. \"But no offence between us, Captain Blood!\"\n\n\"Oh, no offence. But... I'm a thief and a pirate.\" He laughed without\nmirth, and, disregarding the proffered hand, swung on his heel.\n\nLord Julian stood a moment, watching the tall figure as it moved away\ntowards the taffrail. Then letting his arms fall helplessly to his sides\nin dejection, he departed.\n\nJust within the doorway of the alley leading to the cabin, he ran into\nMiss Bishop. Yet she had not been coming out, for her back was towards\nhim, and she was moving in the same direction. He followed her, his mind\ntoo full of Captain Blood to be concerned just then with her movements.\n\nIn the cabin he flung into a chair, and exploded, with a violence\naltogether foreign to his nature.\n\n\"Damme if ever I met a man I liked better, or even a man I liked as\nwell. Yet there's nothing to be done with him.\"\n\n\"So I heard,\" she admitted in a small voice. She was very white, and she\nkept her eyes upon her folded hands.\n\nHe looked up in surprise, and then sat conning her with brooding glance.\n\"I wonder, now,\" he said presently, \"if the mischief is of your working.\nYour words have rankled with him. He threw them at me again and again.\nHe wouldn't take the King's commission; he wouldn't take my hand even.\nWhat's to be done with a fellow like that? He'll end on a yardarm\nfor all his luck. And the quixotic fool is running into danger at the\npresent moment on our behalf.\"\n\n\"How?\" she asked him with a sudden startled interest.\n\n\"How? Have you forgotten that he's sailing to Jamaica, and that Jamaica\nis the headquarters of the English fleet? True, your uncle commands\nit....\"\n\nShe leaned across the table to interrupt him, and he observed that her\nbreathing had grown labored, that her eyes were dilating in alarm.\n\n\"But there is no hope for him in that!\" she cried. \"Oh, don't imagine\nit! He has no bitterer enemy in the world! My uncle is a hard,\nunforgiving man. I believe that it was nothing but the hope of taking\nand hanging Captain Blood that made my uncle leave his Barbados\nplantations to accept the deputy-governorship of Jamaica. Captain Blood\ndoesn't know that, of course....\" She paused with a little gesture of\nhelplessness.\n\n\"I can't think that it would make the least difference if he did,\" said\nhis lordship gravely. \"A man who can forgive such an enemy as Don Miguel\nand take up this uncompromising attitude with me isn't to be judged by\nordinary rules. He's chivalrous to the point of idiocy.\"\n\n\"And yet he has been what he has been and done what he has done in these\nlast three years,\" said she, but she said it sorrowfully now, without\nany of her earlier scorn.\n\nLord Julian was sententious, as I gather that he often was. \"Life can be\ninfernally complex,\" he sighed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. THE SERVICE OF KING JAMES\n\n\nMiss Arabella Bishop was aroused very early on the following morning by\nthe brazen voice of a bugle and the insistent clanging of a bell in the\nship's belfry. As she lay awake, idly watching the rippled green water\nthat appeared to be streaming past the heavily glazed porthole, she\nbecame gradually aware of the sounds of swift, laboured bustle--the\nclatter of many feet, the shouts of hoarse voices, and the persistent\ntrundlings of heavy bodies in the ward-room immediately below the deck\nof the cabin. Conceiving these sounds to portend a more than normal\nactivity, she sat up, pervaded by a vague alarm, and roused her still\nslumbering woman.\n\nIn his cabin on the starboard side Lord Julian, disturbed by the same\nsounds, was already astir and hurriedly dressing. When presently he\nemerged under the break of the poop, he found himself staring up into\na mountain of canvas. Every foot of sail that she could carry had been\ncrowded to the Arabella's yards, to catch the morning breeze. Ahead\nand on either side stretched the limitless expanse of ocean, sparkling\ngolden in the sun, as yet no more than a half-disc of flame upon the\nhorizon straight ahead.\n\nAbout him in the waist, where all last night had been so peaceful, there\nwas a frenziedly active bustle of some threescore men. By the rail,\nimmediately above and behind Lord Julian, stood Captain Blood in\naltercation with a one-eyed giant, whose head was swathed in a red\ncotton kerchief, whose blue shirt hung open at the waist. As his\nlordship, moving forward, revealed himself, their voices ceased, and\nBlood turned to greet him.\n\n\"Good-morning to you,\" he said, and added \"I've blundered badly, so I\nhave. I should have known better than to come so close to Jamaica by\nnight. But I was in haste to land you. Come up here. I have something to\nshow you.\"\n\nWondering, Lord Julian mounted the companion as he was bidden. Standing\nbeside Captain Blood, he looked astern, following the indication of the\nCaptain's hand, and cried out in his amazement. There, not more than\nthree miles away, was land--an uneven wall of vivid green that filled\nthe western horizon. And a couple of miles this side of it, bearing\nafter them, came speeding three great white ships.\n\n\"They fly no colours, but they're part of the Jamaica fleet.\" Blood\nspoke without excitement, almost with a certain listlessness. \"When dawn\nbroke we found ourselves running to meet them. We went about, and it's\nbeen a race ever since. But the Arabella 's been at sea these four\nmonths, and her bottom's too foul for the speed we're needing.\"\n\nWolverstone hooked his thumbs into his broad leather belt, and from his\ngreat height looked down sardonically upon Lord Julian, tall man though\nhis lordship was. \"So that you're like to be in yet another sea-fight\nafore ye've done wi' ships, my lord.\"\n\n\"That's a point we were just arguing,\" said Blood. \"For I hold that\nwe're in no case to fight against such odds.\"\n\n\"The odds be damned!\" Wolverstone thrust out his heavy jowl. \"We're used\nto odds. The odds was heavier at Maracaybo; yet we won out, and took\nthree ships. They was heavier yesterday when we engaged Don Miguel.\"\n\n\"Aye--but those were Spaniards.\"\n\n\"And what better are these?--Are ye afeard of a lubberly Barbados\nplanter? Whatever ails you, Peter? I've never known ye scared afore.\"\n\nA gun boomed out behind them.\n\n\"That'll be the signal to lie to,\" said Blood, in the same listless\nvoice; and he fetched a sigh.\n\nWolverstone squared himself defiantly before his captain\n\n\"I'll see Colonel Bishop in hell or ever I lies to for him.\" And he\nspat, presumably for purposes of emphasis.\n\nHis lordship intervened.\n\n\"Oh, but--by your leave--surely there is nothing to be apprehended from\nColonel Bishop. Considering the service you have rendered to his niece\nand to me....\"\n\nWolverstone's horse-laugh interrupted him. \"Hark to the gentleman!\" he\nmocked. \"Ye don't know Colonel Bishop, that's clear. Not for his niece,\nnot for his daughter, not for his own mother, would he forgo the blood\nwhat he thinks due to him. A drinker of blood, he is. A nasty beast. We\nknows, the Cap'n and me. We been his slaves.\"\n\n\"But there is myself,\" said Lord Julian, with great dignity.\n\nWolverstone laughed again, whereat his lordship flushed. He was moved to\nraise his voice above its usual languid level.\n\n\"I assure you that my word counts for something in England.\"\n\n\"Oh, aye--in England. But this ain't England, damme.\"\n\nCame the roar of a second gun, and a round shot splashed the water less\nthan half a cable's-length astern. Blood leaned over the rail to speak\nto the fair young man immediately below him by the helmsman at the\nwhipstaff.\n\n\"Bid them take in sail, Jeremy,\" he said quietly. \"We lie to.\"\n\nBut Wolverstone interposed again.\n\n\"Hold there a moment, Jeremy!\" he roared. \"Wait!\" He swung back to face\nthe Captain, who had placed a hand on is shoulder and was smiling, a\ntrifle wistfully.\n\n\"Steady, Old Wolf! Steady!\" Captain Blood admonished him.\n\n\"Steady, yourself, Peter. Ye've gone mad! Will ye doom us all to hell\nout of tenderness for that cold slip of a girl?\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Blood in sudden fury.\n\nBut Wolverstone would not stop. \"It's the truth, you fool. It's that\ncursed petticoat's making a coward of you. It's for her that ye're\nafeard--and she, Colonel Bishop's niece! My God, man, ye'll have a\nmutiny aboard, and I'll lead it myself sooner than surrender to be\nhanged in Port Royal.\"\n\nTheir glances met, sullen defiance braving dull anger, surprise, and\npain.\n\n\"There is no question,\" said Blood, \"of surrender for any man aboard\nsave only myself. If Bishop can report to England that I am taken\nand hanged, he will magnify himself and at the same time gratify his\npersonal rancour against me. That should satisfy him. I'll send him a\nmessage offering to surrender aboard his ship, taking Miss Bishop and\nLord Julian with me, but only on condition that the Arabella is allowed\nto proceed unharmed. It's a bargain that he'll accept, if I know him at\nall.\"\n\n\"It's a bargain he'll never be offered,\" retorted Wolverstone, and his\nearlier vehemence was as nothing to his vehemence now. \"Ye're surely\ndaft even to think of it, Peter!\"\n\n\"Not so daft as you when you talk of fighting that.\" He flung out an arm\nas he spoke to indicate the pursuing ships, which were slowly but surely\ncreeping nearer. \"Before we've run another half-mile we shall be within\nrange.\"\n\nWolverstone swore elaborately, then suddenly checked. Out of the tail\nof his single eye he had espied a trim figure in grey silk that was\nascending the companion. So engrossed had they been that they had not\nseen Miss Bishop come from the door of the passage leading to the cabin.\nAnd there was something else that those three men on the poop, and Pitt\nimmediately below them, had failed to observe. Some moments ago Ogle,\nfollowed by the main body of his gun-deck crew, had emerged from the\nbooby hatch, to fall into muttered, angrily vehement talk with those\nwho, abandoning the gun-tackles upon which they were labouring, had come\nto crowd about him.\n\nEven now Blood had no eyes for that. He turned to look at Miss Bishop,\nmarvelling a little, after the manner in which yesterday she had avoided\nhim, that she should now venture upon the quarter-deck. Her presence\nat this moment, and considering the nature of his altercation with\nWolverstone, was embarrassing.\n\nVery sweet and dainty she stood before him in her gown of shimmering\ngrey, a faint excitement tinting her fair cheeks and sparkling in her\nclear, hazel eyes, that looked so frank and honest. She wore no hat,\nand the ringlets of her gold-brown hair fluttered distractingly in the\nmorning breeze.\n\nCaptain Blood bared his head and bowed silently in a greeting which she\nreturned composedly and formally.\n\n\"What is happening, Lord Julian?\" she enquired.\n\nAs if to answer her a third gun spoke from the ships towards which she\nwas looking intent and wonderingly. A frown rumpled her brow. She looked\nfrom one to the other of the men who stood there so glum and obviously\nill at ease.\n\n\"They are ships of the Jamaica fleet,\" his lordship answered her.\n\nIt should in any case have been a sufficient explanation. But before\nmore could be added, their attention was drawn at last to Ogle, who came\nbounding up the broad ladder, and to the men lounging aft in his wake,\nin all of which, instinctively, they apprehended a vague menace.\n\nAt the head of the companion, Ogle found his progress barred by Blood,\nwho confronted him, a sudden sternness in his face and in every line of\nhim.\n\n\"What's this?\" the Captain demanded sharply. \"Your station is on the\ngun-deck. Why have you left it?\"\n\nThus challenged, the obvious truculence faded out of Ogle's bearing,\nquenched by the old habit of obedience and the natural dominance that\nwas the secret of the Captain's rule over his wild followers. But it\ngave no pause to the gunner's intention. If anything it increased his\nexcitement.\n\n\"Captain,\" he said, and as he spoke he pointed to the pursuing ships,\n\"Colonel Bishop holds us. We're in no case either to run or fight.\"\n\nBlood's height seemed to increase, as did his sternness.\n\n\"Ogle,\" said he, in a voice cold and sharp as steel, \"your station is on\nthe gun-deck. You'll return to it at once, and take your crew with you,\nor else....\"\n\nBut Ogle, violent of mien and gesture, interrupted him.\n\n\"Threats will not serve, Captain.\"\n\n\"Will they not?\"\n\nIt was the first time in his buccaneering career that an order of his\nhad been disregarded, or that a man had failed in the obedience to which\nhe pledged all those who joined him. That this insubordination should\nproceed from one of those whom he most trusted, one of his old Barbados\nassociates, was in itself a bitterness, and made him reluctant to that\nwhich instinct told him must be done. His hand closed over the butt of\none of the pistols slung before him.\n\n\"Nor will that serve you,\" Ogle warned him, still more fiercely. \"The\nmen are of my thinking, and they'll have their way.\"\n\n\"And what way may that be?\"\n\n\"The way to make us safe. We'll neither sink nor hang whiles we can help\nit.\"\n\nFrom the three or four score men massed below in the waist came a rumble\nof approval. Captain Blood's glance raked the ranks of those resolute,\nfierce-eyed fellows, then it came to rest again on Ogle. There was here\nquite plainly a vague threat, a mutinous spirit he could not understand.\n\"You come to give advice, then, do you?\" quoth he, relenting nothing of\nhis sternness.\n\n\"That's it, Captain; advice. That girl, there.\" He flung out a bare arm\nto point to her. \"Bishop's girl; the Governor of Jamaica's niece.... We\nwant her as a hostage for our safety.\"\n\n\"Aye!\" roared in chorus the buccaneers below, and one or two of them\nelaborated that affirmation.\n\nIn a flash Captain Blood saw what was in their minds. And for all that\nhe lost nothing of his outward stern composure, fear invaded his heart.\n\n\"And how,\" he asked, \"do you imagine that Miss Bishop will prove such a\nhostage?\"\n\n\"It's a providence having her aboard; a providence. Heave to, Captain,\nand signal them to send a boat, and assure themselves that Miss is here.\nThen let them know that if they attempt to hinder our sailing hence,\nwe'll hang the doxy first and fight for it after. That'll cool Colonel\nBishop's heat, maybe.\"\n\n\"And maybe it won't.\" Slow and mocking came Wolverstone's voice to\nanswer the other's confident excitement, and as he spoke he advanced\nto Blood's side, an unexpected ally. \"Some o' them dawcocks may believe\nthat tale.\" He jerked a contemptuous thumb towards the men in the waist,\nwhose ranks were steadily being increased by the advent of others from\nthe forecastle. \"Although even some o' they should know better, for\nthere's still a few was on Barbados with us, and are acquainted like\nme and you with Colonel Bishop. If ye're counting on pulling Bishop's\nheartstrings, ye're a bigger fool, Ogle, than I've always thought you\nwas with anything but guns. There's no heaving to for such a matter as\nthat unless you wants to make quite sure of our being sunk. Though we\nhad a cargo of Bishop's nieces it wouldn't make him hold his hand.\nWhy, as I was just telling his lordship here, who thought like you that\nhaving Miss Bishop aboard would make us safe, not for his mother would\nthat filthy slaver forgo what's due to him. And if ye' weren't a fool,\nOgle, you wouldn't need me to tell you this. We've got to fight, my\nlads....\"\n\n\"How can we fight, man?\" Ogle stormed at him, furiously battling the\nconviction which Wolverstone's argument was imposing upon his listeners.\n\"You may be right, and you may be wrong. We've got to chance it. It's\nour only chance....\"\n\nThe rest of his words were drowned in the shouts of the hands insisting\nthat the girl be given up to be held as a hostage. And then louder than\nbefore roared a gun away to leeward, and away on their starboard beam\nthey saw the spray flung up by the shot, which had gone wide.\n\n\"They are within range,\" cried Ogle. And leaning from the rail, \"Put\ndown the helm,\" he commanded.\n\nPitt, at his post beside the helmsman, turned intrepidly to face the\nexcited gunner.\n\n\"Since when have you commanded on the main deck, Ogle? I take my orders\nfrom the Captain.\"\n\n\"You'll take this order from me, or, by God, you'll....\"\n\n\"Wait!\" Blood bade him, interrupting, and he set a restraining hand upon\nthe gunner's arm. \"There is, I think, a better way.\"\n\nHe looked over his shoulder, aft, at the advancing ships, the foremost\nof which was now a bare quarter of a mile away. His glance swept in\npassing over Miss Bishop and Lord Julian standing side by side some\npaces behind him. He observed her pale and tense, with parted lips\nand startled eyes that were fixed upon him, an anxious witness of this\ndeciding of her fate. He was thinking swiftly, reckoning the chances\nif by pistolling Ogle he were to provoke a mutiny. That some of the men\nwould rally to him, he was sure. But he was no less sure that the main\nbody would oppose him, and prevail in spite of all that he could do,\ntaking the chance that holding Miss Bishop to ransom seemed to afford\nthem. And if they did that, one way or the other, Miss Bishop would be\nlost. For even if Bishop yielded to their demand, they would retain her\nas a hostage.\n\nMeanwhile Ogle was growing impatient. His arm still gripped by Blood, he\nthrust his face into the Captain's.\n\n\"What better way?\" he demanded. \"There is none better. I'll not be\nbubbled by what Wolverstone has said. He may be right, and he may be\nwrong. We'll test it. It's our only chance, I've said, and we must take\nit.\"\n\nThe better way that was in Captain Blood's mind was the way that already\nhe had proposed to Wolverstone. Whether the men in the panic Ogle had\naroused among them would take a different view from Wolverstone's he\ndid not know. But he saw quite clearly now that if they consented, they\nwould not on that account depart from their intention in the matter\nof Miss Bishop; they would make of Blood's own surrender merely an\nadditional card in this game against the Governor of Jamaica.\n\n\"It's through her that we're in this trap,\" Ogle stormed on. \"Through\nher and through you. It was to bring her to Jamaica that you risked all\nour lives, and we're not going to lose our lives as long as there's a\nchance to make ourselves safe through her.\"\n\nHe was turning again to the helmsman below, when Blood's grip tightened\non his arm. Ogle wrenched it free, with an oath. But Blood's mind was\nnow made up. He had found the only way, and repellent though it might be\nto him, he must take it.\n\n\"That is a desperate chance,\" he cried. \"Mine is the safe and easy\nway. Wait!\" He leaned over the rail. \"Put the helm down,\" he bade Pitt.\n\"Heave her to, and signal to them to send a boat.\"\n\nA silence of astonishment fell upon the ship--of astonishment and\nsuspicion at this sudden yielding. But Pitt, although he shared it, was\nprompt to obey. His voice rang out, giving the necessary orders, and\nafter an instant's pause, a score of hands sprang to execute them.\nCame the creak of blocks and the rattle of slatting sails as they swung\naweather, and Captain Blood turned and beckoned Lord Julian forward.\nHis lordship, after a moment's hesitation, advanced in surprise and\nmistrust--a mistrust shared by Miss Bishop, who, like his lordship and\nall else aboard, though in a different way, had been taken aback by\nBlood's sudden submission to the demand to lie to.\n\nStanding now at the rail, with Lord Julian beside him, Captain Blood\nexplained himself.\n\nBriefly and clearly he announced to all the object of Lord Julian's\nvoyage to the Caribbean, and he informed them of the offer which\nyesterday Lord Julian had made to him.\n\n\"That offer I rejected, as his lordship will tell you, deeming myself\naffronted by it. Those of you who have suffered under the rule of King\nJames will understand me. But now in the desperate case in which we find\nourselves--outsailed, and likely to be outfought, as Ogle has said--I\nam ready to take the way of Morgan: to accept the King's commission and\nshelter us all behind it.\"\n\nIt was a thunderbolt that for a moment left them all dazed. Then Babel\nwas reenacted. The main body of them welcomed the announcement as only\nmen who have been preparing to die can welcome a new lease of life. But\nmany could not resolve one way or the other until they were satisfied\nupon several questions, and chiefly upon one which was voiced by Ogle.\n\n\"Will Bishop respect the commission when you hold it?\"\n\nIt was Lord Julian who answered:\n\n\"It will go very hard with him if he attempts to flout the King's\nauthority. And though he should dare attempt it, be sure that his own\nofficers will not dare to do other than oppose him.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Ogle, \"that is true.\"\n\nBut there were some who were still in open and frank revolt against the\ncourse. Of these was Wolverstone, who at once proclaimed his hostility.\n\n\"I'll rot in hell or ever I serves the King,\" he bawled in a great rage.\n\nBut Blood quieted him and those who thought as he did.\n\n\"No man need follow me into the King's service who is reluctant. That is\nnot in the bargain. What is in the bargain is that I accept this service\nwith such of you as may choose to follow me. Don't think I accept it\nwillingly. For myself, I am entirely of Wolverstone's opinion. I accept\nit as the only way to save us all from the certain destruction into\nwhich my own act may have brought us. And even those of you who do\nnot choose to follow me shall share the immunity of all, and shall\nafterwards be free to depart. Those are the terms upon which I sell\nmyself to the King. Let Lord Julian, the representative of the Secretary\nof State, say whether he agrees to them.\"\n\nPrompt, eager, and clear came his lordship's agreement. And that\nwas practically the end of the matter. Lord Julian, the butt now of\ngood-humouredly ribald jests and half-derisive acclamations, plunged\naway to his cabin for the commission, secretly rejoicing at a turn of\nevents which enabled him so creditably to discharge the business on\nwhich he had been sent.\n\nMeanwhile the bo'sun signalled to the Jamaica ships to send a boat, and\nthe men in the waist broke their ranks and went noisily flocking to line\nthe bulwarks and view the great stately vessels that were racing down\ntowards them.\n\nAs Ogle left the quarter-deck, Blood turned, and came face to face with\nMiss Bishop. She had been observing him with shining eyes, but at sight\nof his dejected countenance, and the deep frown that scarred his\nbrow, her own expression changed. She approached him with a hesitation\nentirely unusual to her. She set a hand lightly upon his arm.\n\n\"You have chosen wisely, sir,\" she commended him, \"however much against\nyour inclinations.\"\n\nHe looked with gloomy eyes upon her for whom he had made this sacrifice.\n\n\"I owed it to you--or thought I did,\" he said.\n\nShe did not understand. \"Your resolve delivered me from a horrible\ndanger,\" she admitted. And she shivered at the memory of it. \"But I do\nnot understand why you should have hesitated when first it was proposed\nto you. It is an honourable service.\"\n\n\"King James's?\" he sneered.\n\n\"England's,\" she corrected him in reproof. \"The country is all, sir;\nthe sovereign naught. King James will pass; others will come and pass;\nEngland remains, to be honourably served by her sons, whatever rancour\nthey may hold against the man who rules her in their time.\"\n\nHe showed some surprise. Then he smiled a little. \"Shrewd advocacy,\" he\napproved it. \"You should have spoken to the crew.\"\n\nAnd then, the note of irony deepening in his voice: \"Do you suppose now\nthat this honourable service might redeem one who was a pirate and a\nthief?\"\n\nHer glance fell away. Her voice faltered a little in replying. \"If he...\nneeds redeeming. Perhaps... perhaps he has been judged too harshly.\"\n\nThe blue eyes flashed, and the firm lips relaxed their grim set.\n\n\"Why... if ye think that,\" he said, considering her, an odd hunger in\nhis glance, \"life might have its uses, after all, and even the service\nof King James might become tolerable.\"\n\nLooking beyond her, across the water, he observed a boat putting off\nfrom one of the great ships, which, hove to now, were rocking gently\nsome three hundred yards away. Abruptly his manner changed. He was like\none recovering, taking himself in hand again. \"If you will go below, and\nget your gear and your woman, you shall presently be sent aboard one of\nthe ships of the fleet.\" He pointed to the boat as he spoke.\n\nShe left him, and thereafter with Wolverstone, leaning upon the rail,\nhe watched the approach of that boat, manned by a dozen sailors, and\ncommanded by a scarlet figure seated stiffly in the stern sheets. He\nlevelled his telescope upon that figure.\n\n\"It'll not be Bishop himself,\" said Wolverstone, between question and\nassertion.\n\n\"No.\" Blood closed his telescope. \"I don't know who it is.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" Wolverstone vented an ejaculation of sneering mirth. \"For all\nhis eagerness, Bishop'd be none so willing to come, hisself. He's been\naboard this hulk afore, and we made him swim for it that time. He'll\nhave his memories. So he sends a deputy.\"\n\nThis deputy proved to be an officer named Calverley, a vigorous,\nself-sufficient fellow, comparatively fresh from England, whose manner\nmade it clear that he came fully instructed by Colonel Bishop upon the\nmatter of how to handle the pirates.\n\nHis air, as he stepped into the waist of the Arabella, was haughty,\ntruculent, and disdainful.\n\nBlood, the King's commission now in his pocket, and Lord Julian standing\nbeside him, waited to receive him, and Captain Calverley was a little\ntaken aback at finding himself confronted by two men so very different\noutwardly from anything that he had expected. But he lost none of his\nhaughty poise, and scarcely deigned a glance at the swarm of fierce,\nhalf-naked fellows lounging in a semicircle to form a background.\n\n\"Good-day to you, sir,\" Blood hailed him pleasantly. \"I have the honour\nto give you welcome aboard the Arabella. My name is Blood--Captain\nBlood, at your service. You may have heard of me.\"\n\nCaptain Calverley stared hard. The airy manner of this redoubtable\nbuccaneer was hardly what he had looked for in a desperate fellow,\ncompelled to ignominious surrender. A thin, sour smile broke on the\nofficer's haughty lips.\n\n\"You'll ruffle it to the gallows, no doubt,\" he said contemptuously.\n\"I suppose that is after the fashion of your kind. Meanwhile it's your\nsurrender I require, my man, not your impudence.\"\n\nCaptain Blood appeared surprised, pained. He turned in appeal to Lord\nJulian.\n\n\"D'ye hear that now? And did ye ever hear the like? But what did I tell\nye? Ye see, the young gentleman's under a misapprehension entirely.\nPerhaps it'll save broken bones if your lordship explains just who and\nwhat I am.\"\n\nLord Julian advanced a step and bowed perfunctorily and rather\ndisdainfully to that very disdainful but now dumbfounded officer. Pitt,\nwho watched the scene from the quarter-deck rail, tells us that his\nlordship was as grave as a parson at a hanging. But I suspect this\ngravity for a mask under which Lord Julian was secretly amused.\n\n\"I have the honour to inform you, sir,\" he said stiffly, \"that Captain\nBlood holds a commission in the King's service under the seal of my Lord\nSunderland, His Majesty's Secretary of State.\"\n\nCaptain Calverley's face empurpled; his eyes bulged. The buccaneers in\nthe background chuckled and crowed and swore among themselves in their\nrelish of this comedy. For a long moment Calverley stared in silence\nat his lordship, observing the costly elegance of his dress, his air of\ncalm assurance, and his cold, fastidious speech, all of which savoured\ndistinctly of the great world to which he belonged.\n\n\"And who the devil may you be?\" he exploded at last.\n\nColder still and more distant than ever grew his lordship's voice.\n\n\"You're not very civil, sir, as I have already noticed. My name is\nWade--Lord Julian Wade. I am His Majesty's envoy to these barbarous\nparts, and my Lord Sunderland's near kinsman. Colonel Bishop has been\nnotified of my coming.\"\n\nThe sudden change in Calverley's manner at Lord Julian's mention of his\nname showed that the notification had been received, and that he had\nknowledge of it.\n\n\"I... I believe that he has,\" said Calverley, between doubt and\nsuspicion. \"That is: that he has been notified of the coming of Lord\nJulian Wade. But... but... aboard this ship...?\" The officer made a\ngesture of helplessness, and, surrendering to his bewilderment, fell\nabruptly silent.\n\n\"I was coming out on the Royal Mary....\"\n\n\"That is what we were advised.\"\n\n\"But the Royal Mary fell a victim to a Spanish privateer, and I might\nnever have arrived at all but for the gallantry of Captain Blood, who\nrescued me.\"\n\nLight broke upon the darkness of Calverley's mind. \"I see. I\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"I will take leave to doubt it.\" His lordship's tone abated nothing of\nits asperity. \"But that can wait. If Captain Blood will show you\nhis commission, perhaps that will set all doubts at rest, and we may\nproceed. I shall be glad to reach Port Royal.\"\n\nCaptain Blood thrust a parchment under Calverley's bulging eyes. The\nofficer scanned it, particularly the seals and signature. He stepped\nback, a baffled, impotent man. He bowed helplessly.\n\n\"I must return to Colonel Bishop for my orders,\" he informed them.\n\nAt that moment a lane was opened in the ranks of the men, and through\nthis came Miss Bishop followed by her octoroon woman. Over his shoulder\nCaptain Blood observed her approach.\n\n\"Perhaps, since Colonel Bishop is with you, you will convey his niece\nto him. Miss Bishop was aboard the Royal Mary also, and I rescued her\ntogether with his lordship. She will be able to acquaint her uncle with\nthe details of that and of the present state of affairs.\"\n\nSwept thus from surprise to surprise, Captain Calverley could do no more\nthan bow again.\n\n\"As for me,\" said Lord Julian, with intent to make Miss Bishop's\ndeparture free from all interference on the part of the buccaneers,\n\"I shall remain aboard the Arabella until we reach Port Royal. My\ncompliments to Colonel Bishop. Say that I look forward to making his\nacquaintance there.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. HOSTILITIES\n\n\nIn the great harbour of Port Royal, spacious enough to have given\nmoorings to all the ships of all the navies of the world, the Arabella\nrode at anchor. Almost she had the air of a prisoner, for a quarter of a\nmile ahead, to starboard, rose the lofty, massive single round tower\nof the fort, whilst a couple of cables'-length astern, and to larboard,\nrode the six men-of-war that composed the Jamaica squadron.\n\nAbeam with the Arabella, across the harbour, were the flat-fronted white\nbuildings of that imposing city that came down to the very water's edge.\nBehind these the red roofs rose like terraces, marking the gentle slope\nupon which the city was built, dominated here by a turret, there by a\nspire, and behind these again a range of green hills with for ultimate\nbackground a sky that was like a dome of polished steel.\n\nOn a cane day-bed that had been set for him on the quarter-deck,\nsheltered from the dazzling, blistering sunshine by an improvised awning\nof brown sailcloth, lounged Peter Blood, a calf-bound, well-thumbed copy\nof Horace's Odes neglected in his hands.\n\nFrom immediately below him came the swish of mops and the gurgle of\nwater in the scuppers, for it was still early morning, and under the\ndirections of Hayton, the bo'sun, the swabbers were at work in the\nwaist and forecastle. Despite the heat and the stagnant air, one of the\ntoilers found breath to croak a ribald buccaneering ditty:\n\n  \"For we laid her board and board,\n   And we put her to the sword,\n   And we sank her in the deep blue sea.\n   So It's heigh-ho, and heave-a-ho!\n   Who'll sail for the Main with me?\"\n\nBlood fetched a sigh, and the ghost of a smile played over his lean,\nsun-tanned face. Then the black brows came together above the vivid\nblue eyes, and thought swiftly closed the door upon his immediate\nsurroundings.\n\nThings had not sped at all well with him in the past fortnight since his\nacceptance of the King's commission. There had been trouble with Bishop\nfrom the moment of landing. As Blood and Lord Julian had stepped ashore\ntogether, they had been met by a man who took no pains to dissemble his\nchagrin at the turn of events and his determination to change it. He\nawaited them on the mole, supported by a group of officers.\n\n\"You are Lord Julian Wade, I understand,\" was his truculent greeting.\nFor Blood at the moment he had nothing beyond a malignant glance.\n\nLord Julian bowed. \"I take it I have the honour to address Colonel\nBishop, Deputy-Governor of Jamaica.\" It was almost as if his lordship\nwere giving the Colonel a lesson in deportment. The Colonel accepted it,\nand belatedly bowed, removing his broad hat. Then he plunged on.\n\n\"You have granted, I am told, the King's commission to this man.\" His\nvery tone betrayed the bitterness of his rancour. \"Your motives were\nno doubt worthy... your gratitude to him for delivering you from the\nSpaniards. But the thing itself is unthinkable, my lord. The commission\nmust be cancelled.\"\n\n\"I don't think I understand,\" said Lord Julian distantly.\n\n\"To be sure you don't, or you'd never ha' done it. The fellow's bubbled\nyou. Why, he's first a rebel, then an escaped slave, and lastly a bloody\npirate. I've been hunting him this year past.\"\n\n\"I assure you, sir, that I was fully informed of all. I do not grant the\nKing's commission lightly.\"\n\n\"Don't you, by God! And what else do you call this? But as His Majesty's\nDeputy-Governor of Jamaica, I'll take leave to correct your mistake in\nmy own way.\"\n\n\"Ah! And what way may that be?\"\n\n\"There's a gallows waiting for this rascal in Port Royal.\"\n\nBlood would have intervened at that, but Lord Julian forestalled him.\n\n\"I see, sir, that you do not yet quite apprehend the circumstances. If\nit is a mistake to grant Captain Blood a commission, the mistake is not\nmine. I am acting upon the instructions of my Lord Sunderland; and with\na full knowledge of all the facts, his lordship expressly designated\nCaptain Blood for this commission if Captain Blood could be persuaded to\naccept it.\"\n\nColonel Bishop's mouth fell open in surprise and dismay.\n\n\"Lord Sunderland designated him?\" he asked, amazed.\n\n\"Expressly.\"\n\nHis lordship waited a moment for a reply. None coming from the\nspeechless Deputy-Governor, he asked a question: \"Would you still\nventure to describe the matter as a mistake, sir? And dare you take the\nrisk of correcting it?\"\n\n\"I... I had not dreamed....\"\n\n\"I understand, sir. Let me present Captain Blood.\"\n\nPerforce Bishop must put on the best face he could command. But that it\nwas no more than a mask for his fury and his venom was plain to all.\n\nFrom that unpromising beginning matters had not improved; rather had\nthey grown worse.\n\nBlood's thoughts were upon this and other things as he lounged there on\nthe day-bed. He had been a fortnight in Port Royal, his ship virtually\na unit now in the Jamaica squadron. And when the news of it reached\nTortuga and the buccaneers who awaited his return, the name of Captain\nBlood, which had stood so high among the Brethren of the Coast, would\nbecome a byword, a thing of execration, and before all was done his life\nmight pay forfeit for what would be accounted a treacherous defection.\nAnd for what had he placed himself in this position? For the sake of\na girl who avoided him so persistently and intentionally that he must\nassume that she still regarded him with aversion. He had scarcely been\nvouchsafed a glimpse of her in all this fortnight, although with that in\nview for his main object he had daily haunted her uncle's residence, and\ndaily braved the unmasked hostility and baffled rancour in which Colonel\nBishop held him. Nor was that the worst of it. He was allowed plainly\nto perceive that it was the graceful, elegant young trifler from St.\nJames's, Lord Julian Wade, to whom her every moment was devoted. And\nwhat chance had he, a desperate adventurer with a record of outlawry,\nagainst such a rival as that, a man of parts, moreover, as he was bound\nto admit?\n\nYou conceive the bitterness of his soul. He beheld himself to be as the\ndog in the fable that had dropped the substance to snatch at a delusive\nshadow.\n\nHe sought comfort in a line on the open page before him:\n\n  \"levius fit patientia quicquid corrigere est nefas.\"\n\nSought it, but hardly found it.\n\nA boat that had approached unnoticed from the shore came scraping and\nbumping against the great red hull of the Arabella, and a raucous voice\nsent up a hailing shout. From the ship's belfry two silvery notes rang\nclear and sharp, and a moment or two later the bo'sun's whistle shrilled\na long wail.\n\nThe sounds disturbed Captain Blood from his disgruntled musings. He\nrose, tall, active, and arrestingly elegant in a scarlet, gold-laced\ncoat that advertised his new position, and slipping the slender volume\ninto his pocket, advanced to the carved rail of the quarter-deck, just\nas Jeremy Pitt was setting foot upon the companion.\n\n\"A note for you from the Deputy-Governor,\" said the master shortly, as\nhe proffered a folded sheet.\n\nBlood broke the seal, and read. Pitt, loosely clad in shirt and\nbreeches, leaned against the rail the while and watched him,\nunmistakable concern imprinted on his fair, frank countenance.\n\nBlood uttered a short laugh, and curled his lip. \"It is a very\nperemptory summons,\" he said, and passed the note to his friend.\n\nThe young master's grey eyes skimmed it. Thoughtfully he stroked his\ngolden beard.\n\n\"You'll not go?\" he said, between question and assertion.\n\n\"Why not? Haven't I been a daily visitor at the fort...?\"\n\n\"But it'll be about the Old Wolf that he wants to see you. It gives him\na grievance at last. You know, Peter, that it is Lord Julian alone has\nstood between Bishop and his hate of you. If now he can show that....\"\n\n\"What if he can?\" Blood interrupted carelessly. \"Shall I be in greater\ndanger ashore than aboard, now that we've but fifty men left, and they\nlukewarm rogues who would as soon serve the King as me? Jeremy, dear\nlad, the Arabella's a prisoner here, bedad, 'twixt the fort there and\nthe fleet yonder. Don't be forgetting that.\"\n\nJeremy clenched his hands. \"Why did ye let Wolverstone and the others\ngo?\" he cried, with a touch of bitterness. \"You should have seen the\ndanger.\"\n\n\"How could I in honesty have detained them? It was in the bargain.\nBesides, how could their staying have helped me?\" And as Pitt did not\nanswer him: \"Ye see?\" he said, and shrugged. \"I'll be getting my hat and\ncane and sword, and go ashore in the cock-boat. See it manned for me.\"\n\n\"Ye're going to deliver yourself into Bishop's hands,\" Pitt warned him.\n\n\"Well, well, maybe he'll not find me quite so easy to grasp as he\nimagines. There's a thorn or two left on me.\" And with a laugh Blood\ndeparted to his cabin.\n\nJeremy Pitt answered the laugh with an oath. A moment he stood\nirresolute where Blood had left him. Then slowly, reluctance dragging\nat his feet, he went down the companion to give the order for the\ncock-boat.\n\n\"If anything should happen to you, Peter,\" he said, as Blood was going\nover the side, \"Colonel Bishop had better look to himself. These fifty\nlads may be lukewarm at present, as you say, but--sink me!--they'll be\nanything but lukewarm if there's a breach of faith.\"\n\n\"And what should be happening to me, Jeremy? Sure, now, I'll be back for\ndinner, so I will.\"\n\nBlood climbed down into the waiting boat. But laugh though he might, he\nknew as well as Pitt that in going ashore that morning he carried\nhis life in his hands. Because of this, it may have been that when he\nstepped on to the narrow mole, in the shadow of the shallow outer wall\nof the fort through whose crenels were thrust the black noses of its\nheavy guns, he gave order that the boat should stay for him at that\nspot. He realized that he might have to retreat in a hurry.\n\nWalking leisurely, he skirted the embattled wall, and passed through the\ngreat gates into the courtyard. Half-a-dozen soldiers lounged there,\nand in the shadow cast by the wall, Major Mallard, the Commandant, was\nslowly pacing. He stopped short at sight of Captain Blood, and saluted\nhim, as was his due, but the smile that lifted the officer's stiff\nmostachios was grimly sardonic. Peter Blood's attention, however, was\nelsewhere.\n\nOn his right stretched a spacious garden, beyond which rose the white\nhouse that was the residence of the Deputy-Governor. In that garden's\nmain avenue, that was fringed with palm and sandalwood, he had caught\nsight of Miss Bishop alone. He crossed the courtyard with suddenly\nlengthened stride.\n\n\"Good-morning to ye, ma'am,\" was his greeting as he overtook her; and\nhat in hand now, he added on a note of protest: \"Sure, it's nothing less\nthan uncharitable to make me run in this heat.\"\n\n\"Why do you run, then?\" she asked him coolly, standing slim and straight\nbefore him, all in white and very maidenly save in her unnatural\ncomposure. \"I am pressed,\" she informed him. \"So you will forgive me if\nI do not stay.\"\n\n\"You were none so pressed until I came,\" he protested, and if his thin\nlips smiled, his blue eyes were oddly hard.\n\n\"Since you perceive it, sir, I wonder that you trouble to be so\ninsistent.\"\n\nThat crossed the swords between them, and it was against Blood's\ninstincts to avoid an engagement.\n\n\"Faith, you explain yourself after a fashion,\" said he. \"But since it\nwas more or less in your service that I donned the King's coat, you\nshould suffer it to cover the thief and pirate.\"\n\nShe shrugged and turned aside, in some resentment and some regret.\nFearing to betray the latter, she took refuge in the former. \"I do my\nbest,\" said she.\n\n\"So that ye can be charitable in some ways!\" He laughed softly. \"Glory\nbe, now, I should be thankful for so much. Maybe I'm presumptuous. But\nI can't forget that when I was no better than a slave in your uncle's\nhousehold in Barbados, ye used me with a certain kindness.\"\n\n\"Why not? In those days you had some claim upon my kindness. You were\njust an unfortunate gentleman then.\"\n\n\"And what else would you be calling me now?\"\n\n\"Hardly unfortunate. We have heard of your good fortune on the seas--how\nyour luck has passed into a byword. And we have heard other things: of\nyour good fortune in other directions.\"\n\nShe spoke hastily, the thought of Mademoiselle d'Ogeron in her mind.\nAnd instantly would have recalled the words had she been able. But Peter\nBlood swept them lightly aside, reading into them none of her meaning,\nas she feared he would.\n\n\"Aye--a deal of lies, devil a doubt, as I could prove to you.\"\n\n\"I cannot think why you should trouble to put yourself on your defence,\"\nshe discouraged him.\n\n\"So that ye may think less badly of me than you do.\"\n\n\"What I think of you can be a very little matter to you, sir.\"\n\nThis was a disarming stroke. He abandoned combat for expostulation.\n\n\"Can ye say that now? Can ye say that, beholding me in this livery of a\nservice I despise? Didn't ye tell me that I might redeem the past? It's\nlittle enough I am concerned to redeem the past save only in your eyes.\nIn my own I've done nothing at all that I am ashamed of, considering the\nprovocation I received.\"\n\nHer glance faltered, and fell away before his own that was so intent.\n\n\"I... I can't think why you should speak to me like this,\" she said,\nwith less than her earlier assurance.\n\n\"Ah, now, can't ye, indeed?\" he cried. \"Sure, then, I'll be telling ye.\"\n\n\"Oh, please.\" There was real alarm in her voice. \"I realize fully what\nyou did, and I realize that partly, at least, you may have been urged by\nconsideration for myself. Believe me, I am very grateful. I shall always\nbe grateful.\"\n\n\"But if it's also your intention always to think of me as a thief and a\npirate, faith, ye may keep your gratitude for all the good it's like to\ndo me.\"\n\nA livelier colour crept into her cheeks. There was a perceptible heave\nof the slight breast that faintly swelled the flimsy bodice of white\nsilk. But if she resented his tone and his words, she stifled her\nresentment. She realized that perhaps she had, herself, provoked his\nanger. She honestly desired to make amends.\n\n\"You are mistaken,\" she began. \"It isn't that.\"\n\nBut they were fated to misunderstand each other.\n\nJealousy, that troubler of reason, had been over-busy with his wits as\nit had with hers.\n\n\"What is it, then?\" quoth he, and added the question: \"Lord Julian?\"\n\nShe started, and stared at him blankly indignant now.\n\n\"Och, be frank with me,\" he urged her, unpardonably. \"'Twill be a\nkindness, so it will.\"\n\nFor a moment she stood before him with quickened breathing, the colour\nebbing and flowing in her cheeks. Then she looked past him, and tilted\nher chin forward.\n\n\"You... you are quite insufferable,\" she said. \"I beg that you will let\nme pass.\"\n\nHe stepped aside, and with the broad feathered hat which he still held\nin his hand, he waved her on towards the house.\n\n\"I'll not be detaining you any longer, ma'am. After all, the cursed\nthing I did for nothing can be undone. Ye'll remember afterwards that it\nwas your hardness drove me.\"\n\nShe moved to depart, then checked, and faced him again. It was she now\nwho was on her defence, her voice quivering with indignation.\n\n\"You take that tone! You dare to take that tone!\" she cried, astounding\nhim by her sudden vehemence. \"You have the effrontery to upbraid me\nbecause I will not take your hands when I know how they are stained;\nwhen I know you for a murderer and worse?\"\n\nHe stared at her open-mouthed.\n\n\"A murderer--I?\" he said at last.\n\n\"Must I name your victims? Did you not murder Levasseur?\"\n\n\"Levasseur?\" He smiled a little. \"So they've told you about that!\"\n\n\"Do you deny it?\"\n\n\"I killed him, it is true. I can remember killing another man in\ncircumstances that were very similar. That was in Bridgetown on the\nnight of the Spanish raid. Mary Traill would tell you of it. She was\npresent.\"\n\nHe clapped his hat on his head with a certain abrupt fierceness, and\nstrode angrily away, before she could answer or even grasp the full\nsignificance of what he had said.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII. HOSTAGES\n\n\nPeter Blood stood in the pillared portico of Government House, and with\nunseeing eyes that were laden with pain and anger, stared out across the\ngreat harbour of Port Royal to the green hills rising from the farther\nshore and the ridge of the Blue Mountains beyond, showing hazily through\nthe quivering heat.\n\nHe was aroused by the return of the negro who had gone to announce him,\nand following now this slave, he made his way through the house to the\nwide piazza behind it, in whose shade Colonel Bishop and my Lord Julian\nWade took what little air there was.\n\n\"So ye've come,\" the Deputy-Governor hailed him, and followed the\ngreeting by a series of grunts of vague but apparently ill-humoured\nimport.\n\nHe did not trouble to rise, not even when Lord Julian, obeying the\ninstincts of finer breeding, set him the example. From under scowling\nbrows the wealthy Barbados planter considered his sometime slave, who,\nhat in hand, leaning lightly upon his long beribboned cane, revealed\nnothing in his countenance of the anger which was being steadily\nnourished by this cavalier reception.\n\nAt last, with scowling brow and in self-sufficient tones, Colonel Bishop\ndelivered himself.\n\n\"I have sent for you, Captain Blood, because of certain news that has\njust reached me. I am informed that yesterday evening a frigate left the\nharbour having on board your associate Wolverstone and a hundred men of\nthe hundred and fifty that were serving under you. His lordship and I\nshall be glad to have your explanation of how you came to permit that\ndeparture.\"\n\n\"Permit?\" quoth Blood. \"I ordered it.\"\n\nThe answer left Bishop speechless for a moment. Then:\n\n\"You ordered it?\" he said in accents of unbelief, whilst Lord Julian\nraised his eyebrows. \"'Swounds! Perhaps you'll explain yourself? Whither\nhas Wolverstone gone?\"\n\n\"To Tortuga. He's gone with a message to the officers commanding the\nother four ships of the fleet that is awaiting me there, telling them\nwhat's happened and why they are no longer to expect me.\"\n\nBishop's great face seemed to swell and its high colour to deepen. He\nswung to Lord Julian.\n\n\"You hear that, my lord? Deliberately he has let Wolverstone loose upon\nthe seas again--Wolverstone, the worst of all that gang of pirates after\nhimself. I hope your lordship begins at last to perceive the folly of\ngranting the King's commission to such a man as this against all my\ncounsels. Why, this thing is... it's just mutiny... treason! By God!\nIt's matter for a court-martial.\"\n\n\"Will you cease your blather of mutiny and treason and courts-martial?\"\nBlood put on his hat, and sat down unbidden. \"I have sent Wolverstone\nto inform Hagthorpe and Christian and Yberville and the rest of my lads\nthat they've one clear month in which to follow my example, quit piracy,\nand get back to their boucans or their logwood, or else sail out of the\nCaribbean Sea. That's what I've done.\"\n\n\"But the men?\" his lordship interposed in his level, cultured voice.\n\"This hundred men that Wolverstone has taken with him?\"\n\n\"They are those of my crew who have no taste for King James's service,\nand have preferred to seek work of other kinds. It was in our compact,\nmy lord, that there should be no constraining of my men.\"\n\n\"I don't remember it,\" said his lordship, with sincerity.\n\nBlood looked at him in surprise. Then he shrugged. \"Faith, I'm not to\nblame for your lordship's poor memory. I say that it was so; and I\ndon't lie. I've never found it necessary. In any case ye couldn't have\nsupposed that I should consent to anything different.\"\n\nAnd then the Deputy-Governor exploded.\n\n\"You have given those damned rascals in Tortuga this warning so that\nthey may escape! That is what you have done. That is how you abuse the\ncommission that has saved your own neck!\"\n\nPeter Blood considered him steadily, his face impassive. \"I will\nremind you,\" he said at last, very quietly, \"that the object in view\nwas--leaving out of account your own appetites which, as every one\nknows, are just those of a hangman--to rid the Caribbean of buccaneers.\nNow, I've taken the most effective way of accomplishing that object. The\nknowledge that I've entered the King's service should in itself go far\ntowards disbanding the fleet of which I was until lately the admiral.\"\n\n\"I see!\" sneered the Deputy-Governor malevolently. \"And if it does not?\"\n\n\"It will be time enough then to consider what else is to be done.\"\n\nLord Julian forestalled a fresh outburst on the part of Bishop.\n\n\"It is possible,\" he said, \"that my Lord Sunderland will be satisfied,\nprovided that the solution is such as you promise.\"\n\nIt was a courteous, conciliatory speech. Urged by friendliness towards\nBlood and understanding of the difficult position in which the buccaneer\nfound himself, his lordship was disposed to take his stand upon the\nletter of his instructions. Therefore he now held out a friendly hand to\nhelp him over the latest and most difficult obstacle which Blood himself\nhad enabled Bishop to place in the way of his redemption. Unfortunately\nthe last person from whom Peter Blood desired assistance at that moment\nwas this young nobleman, whom he regarded with the jaundiced eyes of\njealousy.\n\n\"Anyway,\" he answered, with a suggestion of defiance and more than a\nsuggestion of a sneer, \"it's the most ye should expect from me, and\ncertainly it's the most ye'll get.\"\n\nHis lordship frowned, and dabbed his lips with a handkerchief.\n\n\"I don't think that I quite like the way you put it. Indeed, upon\nreflection, Captain Blood, I am sure that I do not.\"\n\n\"I am sorry for that, so I am,\" said Blood impudently. \"But there it is.\nI'm not on that account concerned to modify it.\"\n\nHis lordship's pale eyes opened a little wider. Languidly he raised his\neyebrows.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said. \"You're a prodigiously uncivil fellow. You disappoint me,\nsir. I had formed the notion that you might be a gentleman.\"\n\n\"And that's not your lordship's only mistake,\" Bishop cut in. \"You made\na worse when you gave him the King's commission, and so sheltered the\nrascal from the gallows I had prepared for him in Port Royal.\"\n\n\"Aye--but the worst mistake of all in this matter of commissions,\"\nsaid Blood to his lordship, \"was the one that trade this greasy slaver\nDeputy-Governor of Jamaica instead of its hangman, which is the office\nfor which he's by nature fitted.\"\n\n\"Captain Blood!\" said his lordship sharply in reproof. \"Upon my soul and\nhonour, sir, you go much too far. You are....\"\n\nBut here Bishop interrupted him. He had heaved himself to his feet, at\nlast, and was venting his fury in unprintable abuse. Captain Blood,\nwho had also risen, stood apparently impassive, for the storm to spend\nitself. When at last this happened, he addressed himself quietly to Lord\nJulian, as if Colonel Bishop had not spoken.\n\n\"Your lordship was about to say?\" he asked, with challenging smoothness.\n\nBut his lordship had by now recovered his habitual composure, and was\nagain disposed to be conciliatory. He laughed and shrugged.\n\n\"Faith! here's a deal of unnecessary heat,\" said he. \"And God knows this\nplaguey climate provides enough of that. Perhaps, Colonel Bishop, you\nare a little uncompromising; and you, sir, are certainly a deal too\npeppery. I have said, speaking on behalf of my Lord Sunderland, that I\nam content to await the result of your experiment.\"\n\nBut Bishop's fury had by now reached a stage in which it was not to be\nrestrained.\n\n\"Are you, indeed?\" he roared. \"Well, then, I am not. This is a matter in\nwhich your lordship must allow me to be the better judge. And, anyhow,\nI'll take the risk of acting on my own responsibility.\"\n\nLord Julian abandoned the struggle. He smiled wearily, shrugged, and\nwaved a hand in implied resignation. The Deputy-Governor stormed on.\n\n\"Since my lord here has given you a commission, I can't regularly deal\nwith you out of hand for piracy as you deserve. But you shall answer\nbefore a court-martial for your action in the matter of Wolverstone, and\ntake the consequences.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Blood. \"Now we come to it. And it's yourself as\nDeputy-Governor will preside over that same court-martial. So that ye\ncan wipe off old scores by hanging me, it's little ye care how ye do\nit!\" He laughed, and added: \"Praemonitus, praemunitus.\"\n\n\"What shall that mean?\" quoth Lord Julian sharply.\n\n\"I had imagined that your lordship would have had some education.\"\n\nHe was at pains, you see, to be provocative.\n\n\"It's not the literal meaning I am asking, sir,\" said Lord Julian, with\nfrosty dignity. \"I want to know what you desire me to understand?\"\n\n\"I'll leave your lordship guessing,\" said Blood. \"And I'll be wishing ye\nboth a very good day.\" He swept off his feathered hat, and made them a\nleg very elegantly.\n\n\"Before you go,\" said Bishop, \"and to save you from any idle rashness,\nI'll tell you that the Harbour-Master and the Commandant have their\norders. You don't leave Port Royal, my fine gallows bird. Damme, I mean\nto provide you with permanent moorings here, in Execution Dock.\"\n\nPeter Blood stiffened, and his vivid blue eyes stabbed the bloated face\nof his enemy. He passed his long cane into his left hand, and with his\nright thrust negligently into the breast of his doublet, he swung to\nLord Julian, who was thoughtfully frowning.\n\n\"Your lordship, I think, promised me immunity from this.\"\n\n\"What I may have promised,\" said his lordship, \"your own conduct makes\nit difficult to perform.\" He rose. \"You did me a service, Captain Blood,\nand I had hoped that we might be friends. But since you prefer to\nhave it otherwise....\" He shrugged, and waved a hand towards the\nDeputy-Governor.\n\nBlood completed the sentence in his own way:\n\n\"Ye mean that ye haven't the strength of character to resist the urgings\nof a bully.\" He was apparently at his ease, and actually smiling. \"Well,\nwell--as I said before--praemonitus, praemunitus. I'm afraid that ye're\nno scholar, Bishop, or ye'd know that I means forewarned, forearmed.\"\n\n\"Forewarned? Ha!\" Bishop almost snarled. \"The warning comes a little\nlate. You do not leave this house.\" He took a step in the direction of\nthe doorway, and raised his voice. \"Ho there...\" he was beginning to\ncall.\n\nThen with a sudden audible catch in his breath, he stopped short.\nCaptain Blood's right hand had reemerged from the breast of his doublet,\nbringing with it a long pistol with silver mountings richly chased,\nwhich he levelled within a foot of the Deputy-Governor's head.\n\n\"And forearmed,\" said he. \"Don't stir from where you are, my lord, or\nthere may be an accident.\"\n\nAnd my lord, who had been moving to Bishop's assistance, stood instantly\narrested. Chap-fallen, with much of his high colour suddenly departed,\nthe Deputy-Governor was swaying on unsteady legs. Peter Blood considered\nhim with a grimness that increased his panic.\n\n\"I marvel that I don't pistol you without more ado, ye fat blackguard.\nIf I don't, it's for the same reason that once before I gave ye your\nlife when it was forfeit. Ye're not aware of the reason, to be sure; but\nit may comfort ye to know that it exists. At the same time I'll warn\nye not to put too heavy a strain on my generosity, which resides at the\nmoment in my trigger-finger. Ye mean to hang me, and since that's the\nworst that can happen to me anyway, you'll realize that I'll not boggle\nat increasing the account by spilling your nasty blood.\" He cast his\ncane from him, thus disengaging his left hand. \"Be good enough to give\nme your arm, Colonel Bishop. Come, come, man, your arm.\"\n\nUnder the compulsion of that sharp tone, those resolute eyes, and that\ngleaming pistol, Bishop obeyed without demur. His recent foul volubility\nwas stemmed. He could not trust himself to speak. Captain Blood tucked\nhis left arm through the Deputy-Governor's proffered right. Then he\nthrust his own right hand with its pistol back into the breast of his\ndoublet.\n\n\"Though invisible, it's aiming at ye none the less, and I give you my\nword of honour that I'll shoot ye dead upon the very least provocation,\nwhether that provocation is yours or another's. Ye'll bear that in mind,\nLord Julian. And now, ye greasy hangman, step out as brisk and lively as\nye can, and behave as naturally as ye may, or it's the black stream\nof Cocytus ye'll be contemplating.\" Arm in arm they passed through the\nhouse, and down the garden, where Arabella lingered, awaiting Peter\nBlood's return.\n\nConsideration of his parting words had brought her first turmoil of\nmind, then a clear perception of what might be indeed the truth of the\ndeath of Levasseur. She perceived that the particular inference drawn\nfrom it might similarly have been drawn from Blood's deliverance of Mary\nTraill. When a man so risks his life for a woman, the rest is easily\nassumed. For the men who will take such risks without hope of personal\ngain are few. Blood was of those few, as he had proved in the case of\nMary Traill.\n\nIt needed no further assurances of his to convince her that she had\ndone him a monstrous injustice. She remembered words he had used--words\noverheard aboard his ship (which he had named the Arabella) on the night\nof her deliverance from the Spanish admiral; words he had uttered when\nshe had approved his acceptance of the King's commission; the words he\nhad spoken to her that very morning, which had but served to move her\nindignation. All these assumed a fresh meaning in her mind, delivered\nnow from its unwarranted preconceptions.\n\nTherefore she lingered there in the garden, awaiting his return that she\nmight make amends; that she might set a term to all misunderstanding.\nIn impatience she awaited him. Yet her patience, it seemed, was to be\ntested further. For when at last he came, it was in company--unusually\nclose and intimate company--with her uncle. In vexation she realized\nthat explanations must be postponed. Could she have guessed the extent\nof that postponement, vexation would have been changed into despair.\n\nHe passed, with his companion, from that fragrant garden into the\ncourtyard of the fort. Here the Commandant, who had been instructed to\nhold himself in readiness with the necessary men against the need to\neffect the arrest of Captain Blood, was amazed by the curious spectacle\nof the Deputy-Governor of Jamaica strolling forth arm in arm and\napparently on the friendliest terms with the intended prisoner. For as\nthey went, Blood was chatting and laughing briskly.\n\nThey passed out of the gates unchallenged, and so came to the mole where\nthe cock-boat from the Arabella was waiting. They took their places side\nby side in the stern sheets, and were pulled away together, always very\nclose and friendly, to the great red ship where Jeremy Pitt so anxiously\nawaited news.\n\nYou conceive the master's amazement to see the Deputy-Governor come\ntoiling up the entrance ladder, with Blood following very close behind\nhim.\n\n\"Sure, I walked into a trap, as ye feared, Jeremy,\" Blood hailed him.\n\"But I walked out again, and fetched the trapper with me. He loves his\nlife, does this fat rascal.\"\n\nColonel Bishop stood in the waist, his great face blenched to the colour\nof clay, his mouth loose, almost afraid to look at the sturdy ruffians\nwho lounged about the shot-rack on the main hatch.\n\nBlood shouted an order to the bo'sun, who was leaning against the\nforecastle bulkhead.\n\n\"Throw me a rope with a running noose over the yardarm there, against\nthe need of it. Now, don't be alarming yourself, Colonel, darling. It's\nno more than a provision against your being unreasonable, which I am\nsure ye'll not be. We'll talk the matter over whiles we are dining, for\nI trust ye'll not refuse to honour my table by your company.\"\n\nHe led away the will-less, cowed bully to the great cabin. Benjamin,\nthe negro steward, in white drawers and cotton shirt, made haste by his\ncommand to serve dinner.\n\nColonel Bishop collapsed on the locker under the stern ports, and spoke\nnow for the first time.\n\n\"May I ask wha... what are your intentions?\" he quavered.\n\n\"Why, nothing sinister, Colonel. Although ye deserve nothing less than\nthat same rope and yardarm, I assure you that it's to be employed only\nas a last resource. Ye've said his lordship made a mistake when he\nhanded me the commission which the Secretary of State did me the honour\nto design for me. I'm disposed to agree with you; so I'll take to the\nsea again. Cras ingens iterabimus aequor. It's the fine Latin scholar\nye'll be when I've done with ye. I'll be getting back to Tortuga and my\nbuccaneers, who at least are honest, decent fellows. So I've fetched ye\naboard as a hostage.\"\n\n\"My God!\" groaned the Deputy-Governor. \"Ye... ye never mean that ye'll\ncarry me to Tortuga!\"\n\nBlood laughed outright. \"Oh, I'd never serve ye such a bad turn as that.\nNo, no. All I want is that ye ensure my safe departure from Port Royal.\nAnd, if ye're reasonable, I'll not even trouble you to swim for it this\ntime. Ye've given certain orders to your Harbour-Master, and others to\nthe Commandant of your plaguey fort. Ye'll be so good as to send for\nthem both aboard here, and inform them in my presence that the Arabella\nis leaving this afternoon on the King's service and is to pass out\nunmolested. And so as to make quite sure of their obedience, they shall\ngo a little voyage with us, themselves. Here's what you require. Now\nwrite--unless you prefer the yardarm.\"\n\nColonel Bishop heaved himself up in a pet. \"You constrain me with\nviolence...\" he was beginning.\n\nBlood smoothly interrupted him.\n\n\"Sure, now, I am not constraining you at all. I'm giving you a perfectly\nfree choice between the pen and the rope. It's a matter for yourself\nentirely.\"\n\nBishop glared at him; then shrugging heavily, he took up the pen and\nsat down at the table. In an unsteady hand he wrote that summons to his\nofficers. Blood despatched it ashore; and then bade his unwilling guest\nto table.\n\n\"I trust, Colonel, your appetite is as stout as usual.\"\n\nThe wretched Bishop took the seat to which he was commanded. As for\neating, however, that was not easy to a man in his position; nor did\nBlood press him. The Captain, himself, fell to with a good appetite.\nBut before he was midway through the meal came Hayton to inform him\nthat Lord Julian Wade had just come aboard, and was asking to see him\ninstantly.\n\n\"I was expecting him,\" said Blood. \"Fetch him in.\"\n\nLord Julian came. He was very stern and dignified. His eyes took in the\nsituation at a glance, as Captain Blood rose to greet him.\n\n\"It's mighty friendly of you to have joined us, my lord.\"\n\n\"Captain Blood,\" said his lordship with asperity, \"I find your humour a\nlittle forced. I don't know what may be your intentions; but I wonder do\nyou realize the risks you are running.\"\n\n\"And I wonder does your lordship realize the risk to yourself in\nfollowing us aboard as I had counted that you would.\"\n\n\"What shall that mean, sir?\"\n\nBlood signalled to Benjamin, who was standing behind Bishop.\n\n\"Set a chair for his lordship. Hayton, send his lordship's boat ashore.\nTell them he'll not be returning yet awhile.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" cried his lordship. \"Blister me! D'ye mean to detain me?\nAre ye mad?\"\n\n\"Better wait, Hayton, in case his lordship should turn violent,\" said\nBlood. \"You, Benjamin, you heard the message. Deliver it.\"\n\n\"Will you tell me what you intend, sir?\" demanded his lordship,\nquivering with anger.\n\n\"Just to make myself and my lads here safe from Colonel Bishop's\ngallows. I've said that I trusted to your gallantry not to leave him in\nthe lurch, but to follow him hither, and there's a note from his hand\ngone ashore to summon the Harbour-Master and the Commandant of the\nfort. Once they are aboard, I shall have all the hostages I need for our\nsafety.\"\n\n\"You scoundrel!\" said his lordship through his teeth.\n\n\"Sure, now, that's entirely a matter of the point of view,\" said Blood.\n\"Ordinarily it isn't the kind of name I could suffer any man to apply to\nme. Still, considering that ye willingly did me a service once, and\nthat ye're likely unwillingly to do me another now, I'll overlook your\ndiscourtesy, so I will.\"\n\nHis lordship laughed. \"You fool,\" he said. \"Do you dream that I came\naboard your pirate ship without taking my measures? I informed the\nCommandant of exactly how you had compelled Colonel Bishop to accompany\nyou. Judge now whether he or the Harbour-Master will obey the summons,\nor whether you will be allowed to depart as you imagine.\"\n\nBlood's face became grave. \"I'm sorry for that,\" said he.\n\nI thought you would be, answered his lordship.\n\n\"Oh, but not on my own account. It's the Deputy-Governor there I'm sorry\nfor. D'ye know what Ye've done? Sure, now, ye've very likely hanged\nhim.\"\n\n\"My God!\" cried Bishop in a sudden increase of panic.\n\n\"If they so much as put a shot across my bows, up goes their\nDeputy-Governor to the yardarm. Your only hope, Colonel, lies in the\nfact that I shall send them word of that intention. And so that you may\nmend as far as you can the harm you have done, it's yourself shall bear\nthem the message, my lord.\"\n\n\"I'll see you damned before I do,\" fumed his lordship.\n\n\"Why, that's unreasonable and unreasoning. But if ye insist, why,\nanother messenger will do as well, and another hostage aboard--as I had\noriginally intended--will make my hand the stronger.\"\n\nLord Julian stared at him, realizing exactly what he had refused.\n\n\"You'll think better of it now that ye understand?\" quoth Blood.\n\n\"Aye, in God's name, go, my lord,\" spluttered Bishop, \"and make yourself\nobeyed. This damned pirate has me by the throat.\"\n\nHis lordship surveyed him with an eye that was not by any means\nadmiring. \"Why, if that is your wish...\" he began. Then he shrugged, and\nturned again to Blood.\n\n\"I suppose I can trust you that no harm will come to Colonel Bishop if\nyou are allowed to sail?\"\n\n\"You have my word for it,\" said Blood. \"And also that I shall put him\nsafely ashore again without delay.\"\n\nLord Julian bowed stiffly to the cowering Deputy-Governor. \"You\nunderstand, sir, that I do as you desire,\" he said coldly.\n\n\"Aye, man, aye!\" Bishop assented hastily.\n\n\"Very well.\" Lord Julian bowed again and took his departure. Blood\nescorted him to the entrance ladder at the foot of which still swung the\nArabella's own cock-boat.\n\n\"It's good-bye, my lord,\" said Blood. \"And there's another thing.\"\nHe proffered a parchment that he had drawn from his pocket. \"It's the\ncommission. Bishop was right when he said it was a mistake.\"\n\nLord Julian considered him, and considering him his expression softened.\n\n\"I am sorry,\" he said sincerely.\n\n\"In other circumstances...\" began Blood. \"Oh, but there! Ye'll\nunderstand. The boat's waiting.\"\n\nYet with his foot on the first rung of the ladder, Lord Julian\nhesitated.\n\n\"I still do not perceive--blister me if I do!--why you should not have\nfound some one else to carry your message to the Commandant, and kept me\naboard as an added hostage for his obedience to your wishes.\"\n\nBlood's vivid eyes looked into the other's that were clear and honest,\nand he smiled, a little wistfully. A moment he seemed to hesitate. Then\nhe explained himself quite fully.\n\n\"Why shouldn't I tell you? It's the same reason that's been urging me\nto pick a quarrel with you so that I might have the satisfaction of\nslipping a couple of feet of steel into your vitals. When I accepted\nyour commission, I was moved to think it might redeem me in the eyes of\nMiss Bishop--for whose sake, as you may have guessed, I took it. But\nI have discovered that such a thing is beyond accomplishment. I should\nhave known it for a sick man's dream. I have discovered also that if\nshe's choosing you, as I believe she is, she's choosing wisely between\nus, and that's why I'll not have your life risked by keeping you aboard\nwhilst the message goes by another who might bungle it. And now perhaps\nye'll understand.\"\n\nLord Julian stared at him bewildered. His long, aristocratic face was\nvery pale.\n\n\"My God!\" he said. \"And you tell me this?\"\n\n\"I tell you because... Oh, plague on it!--so that ye may tell her;\nso that she may be made to realize that there's something of the\nunfortunate gentleman left under the thief and pirate she accounts me,\nand that her own good is my supreme desire. Knowing that, she may...\nfaith, she may remember me more kindly--if It's only in her prayers.\nThat's all, my lord.\"\n\nLord Julian continued to look at the buccaneer in silence. In silence,\nat last, he held out his hand; and in silence Blood took it.\n\n\"I wonder whether you are right,\" said his lordship, \"and whether you\nare not the better man.\"\n\n\"Where she is concerned see that you make sure that I am right. Good-bye\nto you.\"\n\nLord Julian wrung his hand in silence, went down the ladder, and was\npulled ashore. From the distance he waved to Blood, who stood leaning on\nthe bulwarks watching the receding cock-boat.\n\nThe Arabella sailed within the hour, moving lazily before a sluggish\nbreeze. The fort remained silent and there was no movement from the\nfleet to hinder her departure. Lord Julian had carried the message\neffectively, and had added to it his own personal commands.\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV. WAR\n\n\nFive miles out at sea from Port Royal, whence the details of the coast\nof Jamaica were losing their sharpness, the Arabella hove to, and the\nsloop she had been towing was warped alongside.\n\nCaptain Blood escorted his compulsory guest to the head of the ladder.\nColonel Bishop, who for two hours and more had been in a state of mortal\nanxiety, breathed freely at last; and as the tide of his fears receded,\nso that of his deep-rooted hate of this audacious buccaneer resumed its\nnormal flow. But he practised circumspection. If in his heart he vowed\nthat once back in Port Royal there was no effort he would spare, no\nnerve he would not strain, to bring Peter Blood to final moorings in\nExecution Dock, at least he kept that vow strictly to himself.\n\nPeter Blood had no illusions. He was not, and never would be, the\ncomplete pirate. There was not another buccaneer in all the Caribbean\nwho would have denied himself the pleasure of stringing Colonel Bishop\nfrom the yardarm, and by thus finally stifling the vindictive planter's\nhatred have increased his own security. But Blood was not of these.\nMoreover, in the case of Colonel Bishop there was a particular reason\nfor restraint. Because he was Arabella Bishop's uncle, his life must\nremain sacred to Captain Blood.\n\nAnd so the Captain smiled into the sallow, bloated face and the little\neyes that fixed him with a malevolence not to be dissembled.\n\n\"A safe voyage home to you, Colonel, darling,\" said he in valediction,\nand from his easy, smiling manner you would never have dreamt of the\npain he carried in his breast. \"It's the second time ye've served me for\na hostage. Ye'll be well advised to avoid a third. I'm not lucky to you,\nColonel, as you should be perceiving.\"\n\nJeremy Pitt, the master, lounging at Blood's elbow, looked darkly upon\nthe departure of the Deputy-Governor. Behind them a little mob of grim,\nstalwart, sun-tanned buccaneers were restrained from cracking Bishop\nlike a flea only by their submission to the dominant will of their\nleader. They had learnt from Pitt while yet in Port Royal of their\nCaptain's danger, and whilst as ready as he to throw over the King's\nservice which had been thrust upon them, yet they resented the manner\nin which this had been rendered necessary, and they marvelled now at\nBlood's restraint where Bishop was concerned. The Deputy-Governor\nlooked round and met the lowering hostile glances of those fierce eyes.\nInstinct warned him that his life at that moment was held precariously,\nthat an injudicious word might precipitate an explosion of hatred from\nwhich no human power could save him. Therefore he said nothing. He\ninclined his head in silence to the Captain, and went blundering and\nstumbling in his haste down that ladder to the sloop and its waiting\nnegro crew.\n\nThey pushed off the craft from the red hull of the Arabella, bent to\ntheir sweeps, then, hoisting sail, headed back for Port Royal, intent\nupon reaching it before darkness should come down upon them. And Bishop,\nthe great bulk of him huddled in the stem sheets, sat silent, his black\nbrows knitted, his coarse lips pursed, malevolence and vindictiveness\nso whelming now his recent panic that he forgot his near escape of the\nyardarm and the running noose.\n\nOn the mole at Port Royal, under the low, embattled wall of the fort,\nMajor Mallard and Lord Julian waited to receive him, and it was with\ninfinite relief that they assisted him from the sloop.\n\nMajor Mallard was disposed to be apologetic.\n\n\"Glad to see you safe, sir,\" said he. \"I'd have sunk Blood's ship in\nspite of your excellency's being aboard but for your own orders by Lord\nJulian, and his lordship's assurance that he had Blood's word for\nit that no harm should come to you so that no harm came to him. I'll\nconfess I thought it rash of his lordship to accept the word of a damned\npirate....\"\n\n\"I have found it as good as another's,\" said his lordship, cropping the\nMajor's too eager eloquence. He spoke with an unusual degree of that\nfrosty dignity he could assume upon occasion. The fact is that his\nlordship was in an exceedingly bad humour. Having written jubilantly\nhome to the Secretary of State that his mission had succeeded, he was\nnow faced with the necessity of writing again to confess that this\nsuccess had been ephemeral. And because Major Mallard's crisp mostachios\nwere lifted by a sneer at the notion of a buccaneer's word being\nacceptable, he added still more sharply: \"My justification is here in\nthe person of Colonel Bishop safely returned. As against that, sir, your\nopinion does not weigh for very much. You should realize it.\"\n\n\"Oh, as your lordship says.\" Major Mallard's manner was tinged with\nirony. \"To be sure, here is the Colonel safe and sound. And out yonder\nis Captain Blood, also safe and sound, to begin his piratical ravages\nall over again.\"\n\n\"I do not propose to discuss the reasons with you, Major Mallard.\"\n\n\"And, anyway, it's not for long,\" growled the Colonel, finding speech at\nlast. \"No, by.....\" He emphasized the assurance by an unprintable oath.\n\"If I spend the last shilling of my fortune and the last ship of the\nJamaica fleet, I'll have that rascal in a hempen necktie before I rest.\nAnd I'll not be long about it.\" He had empurpled in his angry vehemence,\nand the veins of his forehead stood out like whipcord. Then he checked.\n\n\"You did well to follow Lord Julian's instructions,\" he commended the\nMajor. With that he turned from him, and took his lordship by the arm.\n\"Come, my lord. We must take order about this, you and I.\"\n\nThey went off together, skirting the redoubt, and so through courtyard\nand garden to the house where Arabella waited anxiously. The sight of\nher uncle brought her infinite relief, not only on his own account, but\non account also of Captain Blood.\n\n\"You took a great risk, sir,\" she gravely told Lord Julian after the\nordinary greetings had been exchanged.\n\nBut Lord Julian answered her as he had answered Major Mallard. \"There\nwas no risk, ma'am.\"\n\nShe looked at him in some astonishment. His long, aristocratic face wore\na more melancholy, pensive air than usual. He answered the enquiry in\nher glance:\n\n\"So that Blood's ship were allowed to pass the fort, no harm could come\nto Colonel Bishop. Blood pledged me his word for that.\"\n\nA faint smile broke the set of her lips, which hitherto had been\nwistful, and a little colour tinged her cheeks. She would have pursued\nthe subject, but the Deputy-Governor's mood did not permit it. He\nsneered and snorted at the notion of Blood's word being good for\nanything, forgetting that he owed to it his own preservation at that\nmoment.\n\nAt supper, and for long thereafter he talked of nothing but Blood--of\nhow he would lay him by the heels, and what hideous things he would\nperform upon his body. And as he drank heavily the while, his speech\nbecame increasingly gross and his threats increasingly horrible; until\nin the end Arabella withdrew, white-faced and almost on the verge of\ntears. It was not often that Bishop revealed himself to his niece. Oddly\nenough, this coarse, overbearing planter went in a certain awe of that\nslim girl. It was as if she had inherited from her father the respect in\nwhich he had always been held by his brother.\n\nLord Julian, who began to find Bishop disgusting beyond endurance,\nexcused himself soon after, and went in quest of the lady. He had yet to\ndeliver the message from Captain Blood, and this, he thought, would be\nhis opportunity. But Miss Bishop had retired for the night, and\nLord Julian must curb his impatience--it amounted by now to nothing\nless--until the morrow.\n\nVery early next morning, before the heat of the day came to render the\nopen intolerable to his lordship, he espied her from his window moving\namid the azaleas in the garden. It was a fitting setting for one who was\nstill as much a delightful novelty to him in womanhood as was the azalea\namong flowers. He hurried forth to join her, and when, aroused from\nher pensiveness, she had given him a good-morrow, smiling and frank, he\nexplained himself by the announcement that he bore her a message from\nCaptain Blood.\n\nHe observed her little start and the slight quiver of her lips, and\nobserved thereafter not only her pallor and the shadowy rings about her\neyes, but also that unusually wistful air which last night had escaped\nhis notice.\n\nThey moved out of the open to one of the terraces, where a pergola of\norange-trees provided a shaded sauntering space that was at once cool\nand fragrant. As they went, he considered her admiringly, and marvelled\nat himself that it should have taken him so long fully to realize\nher slim, unusual grace, and to find her, as he now did, so entirely\ndesirable, a woman whose charm must irradiate all the life of a man, and\ntouch its commonplaces into magic.\n\nHe noted the sheen of her red-brown hair, and how gracefully one of its\nheavy ringlets coiled upon her slender, milk-white neck. She wore a gown\nof shimmering grey silk, and a scarlet rose, fresh-gathered, was pinned\nat her breast like a splash of blood. Always thereafter when he thought\nof her it was as he saw her at that moment, as never, I think, until\nthat moment had he seen her.\n\nIn silence they paced on a little way into the green shade. Then she\npaused and faced him.\n\n\"You said something of a message, sir,\" she reminded him, thus betraying\nsome of her impatience.\n\nHe fingered the ringlets of his periwig, a little embarrassed how to\ndeliver himself, considering how he should begin. \"He desired me,\" he\nsaid at last, \"to give you a message that should prove to you that there\nis still something left in him of the unfortunate gentleman that...\nthat.., for which once you knew him.\"\n\n\"That is not now necessary,\" said she very gravely. He misunderstood\nher, of course, knowing nothing of the enlightenment that yesterday had\ncome to her.\n\n\"I think..., nay, I know that you do him an injustice,\" said he.\n\nHer hazel eyes continued to regard him.\n\n\"If you will deliver the message, it may enable me to judge.\"\n\nTo him, this was confusing. He did not immediately answer. He found that\nhe had not sufficiently considered the terms he should employ, and the\nmatter, after all, was of an exceeding delicacy, demanding delicate\nhandling. It was not so much that he was concerned to deliver a message\nas to render it a vehicle by which to plead his own cause. Lord Julian,\nwell versed in the lore of womankind and usually at his ease with ladies\nof the beau-monde, found himself oddly constrained before this frank and\nunsophisticated niece of a colonial planter.\n\nThey moved on in silence and as if by common consent towards the\nbrilliant sunshine where the pergola was intersected by the avenue\nleading upwards to the house. Across this patch of light fluttered a\ngorgeous butterfly, that was like black and scarlet velvet and large\nas a man's hand. His lordship's brooding eyes followed it out of sight\nbefore he answered.\n\n\"It is not easy. Stab me, it is not. He was a man who deserved well. And\namongst us we have marred his chances: your uncle, because he could not\nforget his rancour; you, because... because having told him that in the\nKing's service he would find his redemption of what was past, you would\nnot afterwards admit to him that he was so redeemed. And this, although\nconcern to rescue you was the chief motive of his embracing that same\nservice.\"\n\nShe had turned her shoulder to him so that he should not see her face.\n\n\"I know. I know now,\" she said softly. Then after a pause she added the\nquestion: \"And you? What part has your lordship had in this--that you\nshould incriminate yourself with us?\"\n\n\"My part?\" Again he hesitated, then plunged recklessly on, as men do\nwhen determined to perform a thing they fear. \"If I understood him\naright, if he understood aright, himself, my part, though entirely\npassive, was none the less effective. I implore you to observe that\nI but report his own words. I say nothing for myself.\" His lordship's\nunusual nervousness was steadily increasing. \"He thought, then--so\nhe told me--that my presence here had contributed to his inability to\nredeem himself in your sight; and unless he were so redeemed, then was\nredemption nothing.\"\n\nShe faced him fully, a frown of perplexity bringing her brows together\nabove her troubled eyes.\n\n\"He thought that you had contributed?\" she echoed. It was clear she\nasked for enlightenment. He plunged on to afford it her, his glance a\nlittle scared, his cheeks flushing.\n\n\"Aye, and he said so in terms which told me something that I hope above\nall things, and yet dare not believe, for, God knows, I am no coxcomb,\nArabella. He said... but first let me tell you how I was placed. I had\ngone aboard his ship to demand the instant surrender of your uncle whom\nhe held captive. He laughed at me. Colonel Bishop should be a hostage\nfor his safety. By rashly venturing aboard his ship, I afforded him\nin my own person yet another hostage as valuable at least as Colonel\nBishop. Yet he bade me depart; not from the fear of consequences, for\nhe is above fear, nor from any personal esteem for me whom he confessed\nthat he had come to find detestable; and this for the very reason that\nmade him concerned for my safety.\"\n\n\"I do not understand,\" she said, as he paused. \"Is not that a\ncontradiction in itself?\"\n\n\"It seems so only. The fact is, Arabella, this unfortunate man has\nthe... the temerity to love you.\"\n\nShe cried out at that, and clutched her breast whose calm was suddenly\ndisturbed. Her eyes dilated as she stared at him.\n\n\"I... I've startled you,\" said he, with concern. \"I feared I should. But\nit was necessary so that you may understand.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" she bade him.\n\n\"Well, then: he saw in me one who made it impossible that he should win\nyou--so he said. Therefore he could with satisfaction have killed me.\nBut because my death might cause you pain, because your happiness was\nthe thing that above all things he desired, he surrendered that part of\nhis guarantee of safety which my person afforded him. If his departure\nshould be hindered, and I should lose my life in what might follow,\nthere was the risk that... that you might mourn me. That risk he would\nnot take. Him you deemed a thief and a pirate, he said, and added\nthat--I am giving you his own words always--if in choosing between us\ntwo, your choice, as he believed, would fall on me, then were you in his\nopinion choosing wisely. Because of that he bade me leave his ship, and\nhad me put ashore.\"\n\nShe looked at him with eyes that were aswim with tears. He took a step\ntowards her, a catch in his breath, his hand held out.\n\n\"Was he right, Arabella? My life's happiness hangs upon your answer.\"\n\nBut she continued silently to regard him with those tear-laden eyes,\nwithout speaking, and until she spoke he dared not advance farther.\n\nA doubt, a tormenting doubt beset him. When presently she spoke, he saw\nhow true had been the instinct of which that doubt was born, for her\nwords revealed the fact that of all that he had said the only thing\nthat had touched her consciousness and absorbed it from all other\nconsiderations was Blood's conduct as it regarded herself.\n\n\"He said that!\" she cried. \"He did that! Oh!\" She turned away, and\nthrough the slender, clustering trunks of the bordering orange-trees\nshe looked out across the glittering waters of the great harbour to\nthe distant hills. Thus for a little while, my lord standing stiffly,\nfearfully, waiting for fuller revelation of her mind. At last it came,\nslowly, deliberately, in a voice that at moments was half suffocated.\n\"Last night when my uncle displayed his rancour and his evil rage, it\nbegan to be borne in upon me that such vindictiveness can belong only to\nthose who have wronged. It is the frenzy into which men whip themselves\nto justify an evil passion. I must have known then, if I had not already\nlearnt it, that I had been too credulous of all the unspeakable things\nattributed to Peter Blood. Yesterday I had his own explanation of that\ntale of Levasseur that you heard in St. Nicholas. And now this... this\nbut gives me confirmation of his truth and worth. To a scoundrel such as\nI was too readily brought to believe him, the act of which you have just\ntold me would have been impossible.\"\n\n\"That is my own opinion,\" said his lordship gently.\n\n\"It must be. But even if it were not, that would now weigh for nothing.\nWhat weighs--oh, so heavily and bitterly--is the thought that but for\nthe words in which yesterday I repelled him, he might have been saved.\nIf only I could have spoken to him again before he went! I waited for\nhim; but my uncle was with him, and I had no suspicion that he was going\naway again. And now he is lost--back at his outlawry and piracy, in\nwhich ultimately he will be taken and destroyed. And the fault is\nmine--mine!\"\n\n\"What are you saying? The only agents were your uncle's hostility and\nhis own obstinacy which would not study compromise. You must not blame\nyourself for anything.\"\n\nShe swung to him with some impatience, her eyes aswim in tears. \"You can\nsay that, and in spite of his message, which in itself tells how much\nI was to blame! It was my treatment of him, the epithets I cast at him\nthat drove him. So much he has told you. I know it to be true.\"\n\n\"You have no cause for shame,\" said he. \"As for your sorrow--why, if it\nwill afford you solace--you may still count on me to do what man can to\nrescue him from this position.\"\n\nShe caught her breath.\n\n\"You will do that!\" she cried with sudden eager hopefulness. \"You\npromise?\" She held out her hand to him impulsively. He took it in both\nhis own.\n\n\"I promise,\" he answered her. And then, retaining still the hand she\nhad surrendered to him--\"Arabella,\" he said very gently, \"there is still\nthis other matter upon which you have not answered me.\"\n\n\"This other matter?\" Was he mad, she wondered.\n\nCould any other matter signify in such a moment.\n\n\"This matter that concerns myself; and all my future, oh, so very\nclosely. This thing that Blood believed, that prompted him..., that ...\nthat you are not indifferent to me.\" He saw the fair face change colour\nand grow troubled once more.\n\n\"Indifferent to you?\" said she. \"Why, no. We have been good friends; we\nshall continue so, I hope, my lord.\"\n\n\"Friends! Good friends?\" He was between dismay and bitterness. \"It is\nnot your friendship only that I ask, Arabella. You heard what I said,\nwhat I reported. You will not say that Peter Blood was wrong?\"\n\nGently she sought to disengage her hand, the trouble in her face\nincreasing. A moment he resisted; then, realizing what he did, he set\nher free.\n\n\"Arabella!\" he cried on a note of sudden pain.\n\n\"I have friendship for you, my lord. But only friendship.\" His castle of\nhopes came clattering down about him, leaving him a little stunned. As\nhe had said, he was no coxcomb. Yet there was something that he did\nnot understand. She confessed to friendship, and it was in his power\nto offer her a great position, one to which she, a colonial planter's\nniece, however wealthy, could never have aspired even in her dreams.\nThis she rejected, yet spoke of friendship. Peter Blood had been\nmistaken, then. How far had he been mistaken? Had he been as mistaken in\nher feelings towards himself as he obviously was in her feelings towards\nhis lordship? In that case ... His reflections broke short. To speculate\nwas to wound himself in vain. He must know. Therefore he asked her with\ngrim frankness:\n\n\"Is it Peter Blood?\"\n\n\"Peter Blood?\" she echoed. At first she did not understand the purport\nof his question. When understanding came, a flush suffused her face.\n\n\"I do not know,\" she said, faltering a little.\n\nThis was hardly a truthful answer. For, as if an obscuring veil had\nsuddenly been rent that morning, she was permitted at last to see Peter\nBlood in his true relations to other men, and that sight, vouchsafed\nher twenty-four hours too late, filled her with pity and regret and\nyearning.\n\nLord Julian knew enough of women to be left in no further doubt. He\nbowed his head so that she might not see the anger in his eyes, for as\na man of honour he took shame in that anger which as a human being he\ncould not repress.\n\nAnd because Nature in him was stronger--as it is in most of us--than\ntraining, Lord Julian from that moment began, almost in spite of\nhimself, to practise something that was akin to villainy. I regret\nto chronicle it of one for whom--if I have done him any sort of\njustice--you should have been conceiving some esteem. But the truth\nis that the lingering remains of the regard in which he had held Peter\nBlood were choked by the desire to supplant and destroy a rival. He had\npassed his word to Arabella that he would use his powerful influence on\nBlood's behalf. I deplore to set it down that not only did he forget his\npledge, but secretly set himself to aid and abet Arabella's uncle in the\nplans he laid for the trapping and undoing of the buccaneer. He might\nreasonably have urged--had he been taxed with it--that he conducted\nhimself precisely as his duty demanded. But to that he might have been\nanswered that duty with him was but the slave of jealousy in this.\n\nWhen the Jamaica fleet put to sea some few days later, Lord Julian\nsailed with Colonel Bishop in Vice-Admiral Craufurd's flagship. Not only\nwas there no need for either of them to go, but the Deputy-Governor's\nduties actually demanded that he should remain ashore, whilst Lord\nJulian, as we know, was a useless man aboard a ship. Yet both set out\nto hunt Captain Blood, each making of his duty a pretext for the\nsatisfaction of personal aims; and that common purpose became a link\nbetween them, binding them in a sort of friendship that must otherwise\nhave been impossible between men so dissimilar in breeding and in\naspirations.\n\nThe hunt was up. They cruised awhile off Hispaniola, watching the\nWindward Passage, and suffering the discomforts of the rainy season\nwhich had now set in. But they cruised in vain, and after a month of\nit, returned empty-handed to Port Royal, there to find awaiting them the\nmost disquieting news from the Old World.\n\nThe megalomania of Louis XIV had set Europe in a blaze of war. The\nFrench legionaries were ravaging the Rhine provinces, and Spain had\njoined the nations leagued to defend themselves from the wild ambitions\nof the King of France. And there was worse than this: there were rumours\nof civil war in England, where the people had grown weary of the bigoted\ntyranny of King James. It was reported that William of Orange had been\ninvited to come over.\n\nWeeks passed, and every ship from home brought additional news. William\nhad crossed to England, and in March of that year 1689 they learnt in\nJamaica that he had accepted the crown and that James had thrown himself\ninto the arms of France for rehabilitation.\n\nTo a kinsman of Sunderland's this was disquieting news, indeed. It was\nfollowed by letters from King William's Secretary of State informing\nColonel Bishop that there was war with France, and that in view of its\neffect upon the Colonies a Governor-General was coming out to the\nWest Indies in the person of Lord Willoughby, and that with him came a\nsquadron under the command of Admiral van der Kuylen to reenforce the\nJamaica fleet against eventualities.\n\nBishop realized that this must mean the end of his supreme authority,\neven though he should continue in Port Royal as Deputy-Governor. Lord\nJulian, in the lack of direct news to himself, did not know what it\nmight mean to him. But he had been very close and confidential with\nColonel Bishop regarding his hopes of Arabella, and Colonel Bishop more\nthan ever, now that political events put him in danger of being retired,\nwas anxious to enjoy the advantages of having a man of Lord Julian's\neminence for his relative.\n\nThey came to a complete understanding in the matter, and Lord Julian\ndisclosed all that he knew.\n\n\"There is one obstacle in our path,\" said he. \"Captain Blood. The girl\nis in love with him.\"\n\n\"Ye're surely mad!\" cried Bishop, when he had recovered speech.\n\n\"You are justified of the assumption,\" said his lordship dolefully. \"But\nI happen to be sane, and to speak with knowledge.\"\n\n\"With knowledge?\"\n\n\"Arabella herself has confessed it to me.\"\n\n\"The brazen baggage! By God, I'll bring her to her senses.\" It was the\nslave-driver speaking, the man who governed with a whip.\n\n\"Don't be a fool, Bishop.\" His lordship's contempt did more than\nany argument to calm the Colonel. \"That's not the way with a girl of\nArabella's spirit. Unless you want to wreck my chances for all time,\nyou'll hold your tongue, and not interfere at all.\"\n\n\"Not interfere? My God, what, then?\"\n\n\"Listen, man. She has a constant mind. I don't think you know your\nniece. As long as Blood lives, she will wait for him.\"\n\n\"Then with Blood dead, perhaps she will come to her silly senses.\"\n\n\"Now you begin to show intelligence,\" Lord Julian commended him. \"That\nis the first essential step.\"\n\n\"And here is our chance to take it.\" Bishop warmed to a sort of\nenthusiasm. \"This war with France removes all restrictions in the matter\nof Tortuga. We are free to invest it in the service of the Crown. A\nvictory there and we establish ourselves in the favour of this new\ngovernment.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Lord Julian, and he pulled thoughtfully at his lip.\n\n\"I see that you understand,\" Bishop laughed coarsely. \"Two birds with\none stone, eh? We'll hunt this rascal in his lair, right under the\nbeard of the King of France, and we'll take him this time, if we reduce\nTortuga to a heap of ashes.\"\n\nOn that expedition they sailed two days later--which would be some three\nmonths after Blood's departure--taking every ship of the fleet, and\nseveral lesser vessels as auxiliaries. To Arabella and the world in\ngeneral it was given out that they were going to raid French Hispaniola,\nwhich was really the only expedition that could have afforded Colonel\nBishop any sort of justification for leaving Jamaica at all at such\na time. His sense of duty, indeed, should have kept him fast in\nPort Royal; but his sense of duty was smothered in hatred--that most\nfruitless and corruptive of all the emotions. In the great cabin of\nVice-Admiral Craufurd's flagship, the Imperator, the Deputy-Governor got\ndrunk that night to celebrate his conviction that the sands of Captain\nBlood's career were running out.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV. THE SERVICE OF KING LOUIS\n\n\nMeanwhile, some three months before Colonel Bishop set out to reduce\nTortuga, Captain Blood, bearing hell in his soul, had blown into its\nrockbound harbour ahead of the winter gales, and two days ahead of the\nfrigate in which Wolverstone had sailed from Port Royal a day before\nhim.\n\nIn that snug anchorage he found his fleet awaiting him--the four ships\nwhich had been separated in that gale off the Lesser Antilles, and some\nseven hundred men composing their crews. Because they had been beginning\nto grow anxious on his behalf, they gave him the greater welcome. Guns\nwere fired in his honour and the ships made themselves gay with bunting.\nThe town, aroused by all this noise in the harbour, emptied itself\nupon the jetty, and a vast crowd of men and women of all creeds and\nnationalities collected there to be present at the coming ashore of the\ngreat buccaneer.\n\nAshore he went, probably for no other reason than to obey the general\nexpectation. His mood was taciturn; his face grim and sneering. Let\nWolverstone arrive, as presently he would, and all this hero-worship\nwould turn to execration.\n\nHis captains, Hagthorpe, Christian, and Yberville, were on the jetty to\nreceive him, and with them were some hundreds of his buccaneers. He cut\nshort their greetings, and when they plagued him with questions of where\nhe had tarried, he bade them await the coming of Wolverstone, who would\nsatisfy their curiosity to a surfeit. On that he shook them off, and\nshouldered his way through that heterogeneous throng that was composed\nof bustling traders of several nations--English, French, and Dutch--of\nplanters and of seamen of various degrees, of buccaneers who were\nfruit-selling half-castes, negro slaves, some doll-tearsheets and\ndunghill-queans from the Old World, and all the other types of the human\nfamily that converted the quays of Cayona into a disreputable image of\nBabel.\n\nWinning clear at last, and after difficulties, Captain Blood took his\nway alone to the fine house of M. d'Ogeron, there to pay his respects to\nhis friends, the Governor and the Governor's family.\n\nAt first the buccaneers jumped to the conclusion that Wolverstone was\nfollowing with some rare prize of war, but gradually from the reduced\ncrew of the Arabella a very different tale leaked out to stem their\nsatisfaction and convert it into perplexity. Partly out of loyalty to\ntheir captain, partly because they perceived that if he was guilty of\ndefection they were guilty with him, and partly because being simple,\nsturdy men of their hands, they were themselves in the main a little\nconfused as to what really had happened, the crew of the Arabella\npractised reticence with their brethren in Tortuga during those two\ndays before Wolverstone's arrival. But they were not reticent enough\nto prevent the circulation of certain uneasy rumours and extravagant\nstories of discreditable adventures--discreditable, that is, from the\nbuccaneering point of view--of which Captain Blood had been guilty.\n\nBut that Wolverstone came when he did, it is possible that there would\nhave been an explosion. When, however, the Old Wolf cast anchor in the\nbay two days later, it was to him all turned for the explanation they\nwere about to demand of Blood.\n\nNow Wolverstone had only one eye; but he saw a deal more with that\none eye than do most men with two; and despite his grizzled head--so\npicturesquely swathed in a green and scarlet turban--he had the sound\nheart of a boy, and in that heart much love for Peter Blood.\n\nThe sight of the Arabella at anchor in the bay had at first amazed him\nas he sailed round the rocky headland that bore the fort. He rubbed his\nsingle eye clear of any deceiving film and looked again. Still he could\nnot believe what it saw. And then a voice at his elbow--the voice of\nDyke, who had elected to sail with him--assured him that he was not\nsingular in his bewilderment.\n\n\"In the name of Heaven, is that the Arabella or is it the ghost of her?\"\n\nThe Old Wolf rolled his single eye over Dyke, and opened his mouth to\nspeak. Then he closed it again without having spoken; closed it tightly.\nHe had a great gift of caution, especially in matters that he did not\nunderstand. That this was the Arabella he could no longer doubt. That\nbeing so, he must think before he spoke. What the devil should the\nArabella be doing here, when he had left her in Jamaica? And was Captain\nBlood aboard and in command, or had the remainder of her hands made off\nwith her, leaving the Captain in Port Royal?\n\nDyke repeated his question. This time Wolverstone answered him.\n\n\"Ye've two eyes to see with, and ye ask me, who's only got one, what it\nis ye see!\"\n\n\"But I see the Arabella.\"\n\n\"Of course, since there she rides. What else was you expecting?\"\n\n\"Expecting?\" Dyke stared at him, open-mouthed. \"Was you expecting to\nfind the Arabella here?\"\n\nWolverstone looked him over in contempt, then laughed and spoke loud\nenough to be heard by all around him. \"Of course. What else?\" And he\nlaughed again, a laugh that seemed to Dyke to be calling him a fool.\nOn that Wolverstone turned to give his attention to the operation of\nanchoring.\n\nAnon when ashore he was beset by questioning buccaneers, it was from\ntheir very questions that he gathered exactly how matters stood, and\nperceived that either from lack of courage or other motive Blood,\nhimself, had refused to render any account of his doings since the\nArabella had separated from her sister ships. Wolverstone congratulated\nhimself upon the discretion he had used with Dyke.\n\n\"The Captain was ever a modest man,\" he explained to Hagthorpe and those\nothers who came crowding round him. \"It's not his way to be sounding his\nown praises. Why, it was like this. We fell in with old Don Miguel,\nand when we'd scuttled him we took aboard a London pimp sent out by the\nSecretary of State to offer the Captain the King's commission if so be\nhim'd quit piracy and be o' good behaviour. The Captain damned his soul\nto hell for answer. And then we fell in wi' the Jamaica fleet and that\ngrey old devil Bishop in command, and there was a sure end to Captain\nBlood and to every mother's son of us all. So I goes to him, and 'accept\nthis poxy commission,' says I; 'turn King's man and save your neck and\nours.' He took me at my word, and the London pimp gave him the King's\ncommission on the spot, and Bishop all but choked hisself with rage when\nhe was told of it. But happened it had, and he was forced to swallow\nit. We were King's men all, and so into Port Royal we sailed along\no' Bishop. But Bishop didn't trust us. He knew too much. But for his\nlordship, the fellow from London, he'd ha' hanged the Captain, King's\ncommission and all. Blood would ha' slipped out o' Port Royal again that\nsame night. But that hound Bishop had passed the word, and the fort kept\na sharp lookout. In the end, though it took a fortnight, Blood bubbled\nhim. He sent me and most o' the men off in a frigate that I bought for\nthe voyage. His game--as he'd secretly told me--was to follow and give\nchase. Whether that's the game he played or not I can't tell ye; but\nhere he is afore me as I'd expected he would be.\"\n\nThere was a great historian lost in Wolverstone. He had the right\nimagination that knows just how far it is safe to stray from the truth\nand just how far to colour it so as to change its shape for his own\npurposes.\n\nHaving delivered himself of his decoction of fact and falsehood, and\nthereby added one more to the exploits of Peter Blood, he enquired\nwhere the Captain might be found. Being informed that he kept his ship,\nWolverstone stepped into a boat and went aboard, to report himself, as\nhe put it.\n\nIn the great cabin of the Arabella he found Peter Blood alone and very\nfar gone in drink--a condition in which no man ever before remembered to\nhave seen him. As Wolverstone came in, the Captain raised bloodshot eyes\nto consider him. A moment they sharpened in their gaze as he brought\nhis visitor into focus. Then he laughed, a loose, idiot laugh, that yet\nsomehow was half a sneer.\n\n\"Ah! The Old Wolf!\" said he. \"Got here at last, eh? And whatcher\ngonnerdo wi' me, eh?\" He hiccoughed resoundingly, and sagged back\nloosely in his chair.\n\nOld Wolverstone stared at him in sombre silence. He had looked with\nuntroubled eye upon many a hell of devilment in his time, but the sight\nof Captain Blood in this condition filled him with sudden grief. To\nexpress it he loosed an oath. It was his only expression for emotion\nof all kinds. Then he rolled forward, and dropped into a chair at the\ntable, facing the Captain.\n\n\"My God, Peter, what's this?\"\n\n\"Rum,\" said Peter. \"Rum, from Jamaica.\" He pushed bottle and glass\ntowards Wolverstone.\n\nWolverstone disregarded them.\n\n\"I'm asking you what ails you?\" he bawled.\n\n\"Rum,\" said Captain Blood again, and smiled. \"Jus' rum. I answer all\nyour queshons. Why donjerr answer mine? Whatcher gonerdo wi' me?\"\n\n\"I've done it,\" said Wolverstone. \"Thank God, ye had the sense to hold\nyour tongue till I came. Are ye sober enough to understand me?\"\n\n\"Drunk or sober, allus 'derstand you.\"\n\n\"Then listen.\" And out came the tale that Wolverstone had told. The\nCaptain steadied himself to grasp it.\n\n\"It'll do as well asertruth,\" said he when Wolverstone had finished.\n\"And... oh, no marrer! Much obliged to ye, Old Wolf--faithful Old Wolf!\nBut was it worthertrouble? I'm norrer pirate now; never a pirate again.\n'S finished'\" He banged the table, his eyes suddenly fierce.\n\n\"I'll come and talk to you again when there's less rum in your wits,\"\nsaid Wolverstone, rising. \"Meanwhile ye'll please to remember the tale\nI've told, and say nothing that'll make me out a liar. They all believes\nme, even the men as sailed wi' me from Port Royal. I've made 'em. If\nthey thought as how you'd taken the King's commission in earnest, and\nfor the purpose o' doing as Morgan did, ye guess what would follow.\"\n\n\"Hell would follow,\" said the Captain. \"An' tha's all I'm fit for.\"\n\n\"Ye're maudlin,\" Wolverstone growled. \"We'll talk again to-morrow.\"\n\nThey did; but to little purpose, either that day or on any day\nthereafter while the rains--which set in that night--endured. Soon the\nshrewd Wolverstone discovered that rum was not what ailed Blood. Rum\nwas in itself an effect, and not by any means the cause of the Captain's\nlistless apathy. There was a canker eating at his heart, and the Old\nWolf knew enough to make a shrewd guess of its nature. He cursed all\nthings that daggled petticoats, and, knowing his world, waited for the\nsickness to pass.\n\nBut it did not pass. When Blood was not dicing or drinking in the\ntaverns of Tortuga, keeping company that in his saner days he had\nloathed, he was shut up in his cabin aboard the Arabella, alone and\nuncommunicative. His friends at Government House, bewildered at\nthis change in him, sought to reclaim him. Mademoiselle d'Ogeron,\nparticularly distressed, sent him almost daily invitations, to few of\nwhich he responded.\n\nLater, as the rainy season approached its end, he was sought by his\ncaptains with proposals of remunerative raids on Spanish settlements.\nBut to all he manifested an indifference which, as the weeks passed\nand the weather became settled, begot first impatience and then\nexasperation.\n\nChristian, who commanded the Clotho, came storming to him one day,\nupbraiding him for his inaction, and demanding that he should take order\nabout what was to do.\n\n\"Go to the devil!\" Blood said, when he had heard him out. Christian\ndeparted fuming, and on the morrow the Clotho weighed anchor and sailed\naway, setting an example of desertion from which the loyalty of Blood's\nother captains would soon be unable to restrain their men.\n\nSometimes Blood asked himself why had he come back to Tortuga at all.\nHeld fast in bondage by the thought of Arabella and her scorn of him for\na thief and a pirate, he had sworn that he had done with buccaneering.\nWhy, then, was he here? That question he would answer with another:\nWhere else was he to go? Neither backward nor forward could he move, it\nseemed.\n\nHe was degenerating visibly, under the eyes of all. He had entirely lost\nthe almost foppish concern for his appearance, and was grown careless\nand slovenly in his dress. He allowed a black beard to grow on cheeks\nthat had ever been so carefully shaven; and the long, thick black hair,\nonce so sedulously curled, hung now in a lank, untidy mane about a face\nthat was changing from its vigorous swarthiness to an unhealthy sallow,\nwhilst the blue eyes, that had been so vivid and compelling, were now\ndull and lacklustre.\n\nWolverstone, the only one who held the clue to this degeneration,\nventured once--and once only--to beard him frankly about it.\n\n\"Lord, Peter! Is there never to be no end to this?\" the giant had\ngrowled. \"Will you spend your days moping and swilling 'cause a\nwhite-faced ninny in Port Royal'll have none o' ye? 'Sblood and 'ounds!\nIf ye wants the wench, why the plague doesn't ye go and fetch her?\"\n\nThe blue eyes glared at him from under the jet-black eyebrows, and\nsomething of their old fire began to kindle in them. But Wolverstone\nwent on heedlessly.\n\n\"I'll be nice wi' a wench as long as niceness be the key to her favour.\nBut sink me now if I'd rot myself in rum on account of anything that\nwears a petticoat. That's not the Old Wolf's way. If there's no other\nexpedition'll tempt you, why not Port Royal? What a plague do it matter\nif it is an English settlement? It's commanded by Colonel Bishop, and\nthere's no lack of rascals in your company'd follow you to hell if it\nmeant getting Colonel Bishop by the throat. It could be done, I tell\nyou. We've but to spy the chance when the Jamaica fleet is away. There's\nenough plunder in the town to tempt the lads, and there's the wench for\nyou. Shall I sound them on 't?\"\n\nBlood was on his feet, his eyes blazing, his livid face distorted.\n\"Ye'll leave my cabin this minute, so ye will, or, by Heaven, it's your\ncorpse'll be carried out of it. Ye mangy hound, d'ye dare come to me\nwith such proposals?\"\n\nHe fell to cursing his faithful officer with a virulence the like of\nwhich he had never yet been known to use. And Wolverstone, in terror\nbefore that fury, went out without another word. The subject was not\nraised again, and Captain Blood was left to his idle abstraction.\n\nBut at last, as his buccaneers were growing desperate, something\nhappened, brought about by the Captain's friend M. d'Ogeron. One sunny\nmorning the Governor of Tortuga came aboard the Arabella, accompanied\nby a chubby little gentleman, amiable of countenance, amiable and\nself-sufficient of manner.\n\n\"My Captain,\" M. d'Ogeron delivered himself, \"I bring you M. de Cussy,\nthe Governor of French Hispaniola, who desires a word with you.\"\n\nOut of consideration for his friend, Captain Blood pulled the pipe from\nhis mouth, shook some of the rum out of his wits, and rose and made a\nleg to M. de Cussy.\n\n\"Serviteur!\" said he.\n\nM. de Cussy returned the bow and accepted a seat on the locker under the\nstem windows.\n\n\"You have a good force here under your command, my Captain,\" said he.\n\n\"Some eight hundred men.\"\n\n\"And I understand they grow restive in idleness.\"\n\n\"They may go to the devil when they please.\"\n\nM. de Cussy took snuff delicately. \"I have something better than that to\npropose,\" said he.\n\n\"Propose it, then,\" said Blood, without interest.\n\nM. de Cussy looked at M. d'Ogeron, and raised his eyebrows a little.\nHe did not find Captain Blood encouraging. But M. d'Ogeron nodded\nvigorously with pursed lips, and the Governor of Hispaniola propounded\nhis business.\n\n\"News has reached us from France that there is war with Spain.\"\n\n\"That is news, is it?\" growled Blood.\n\n\"I am speaking officially, my Captain. I am not alluding to unofficial\nskirmishes, and unofficial predatory measures which we have condoned out\nhere. There is war--formally war--between France and Spain in Europe. It\nis the intention of France that this war shall be carried into the New\nWorld. A fleet is coming out from Brest under the command of M. le Baron\nde Rivarol for that purpose. I have letters from him desiring me to\nequip a supplementary squadron and raise a body of not less than a\nthousand men to reenforce him on his arrival. What I have come to\npropose to you, my Captain, at the suggestion of our good friend M.\nd'Ogeron, is, in brief, that you enroll your ships and your force under\nM. de Rivarol's flag.\"\n\nBlood looked at him with a faint kindling of interest. \"You are\noffering to take us into the French service?\" he asked. \"On what terms,\nmonsieur?\"\n\n\"With the rank of Capitaine de Vaisseau for yourself, and suitable ranks\nfor the officers serving under you. You will enjoy the pay of that rank,\nand you will be entitled, together with your men, to one-tenth share in\nall prizes taken.\"\n\n\"My men will hardly account it generous. They will tell you that they\ncan sail out of here to-morrow, disembowel a Spanish settlement, and\nkeep the whole of the plunder.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, but with the risks attaching to acts of piracy. With us your\nposition will be regular and official, and considering the powerful\nfleet by which M. de Rivarol is backed, the enterprises to be undertaken\nwill be on a much vaster scale than anything you could attempt on your\nown account. So that the one tenth in this case may be equal to more\nthan the whole in the other.\"\n\nCaptain Blood considered. This, after all, was not piracy that was being\nproposed. It was honourable employment in the service of the King of\nFrance.\n\n\"I will consult my officers,\" he said; and he sent for them.\n\nThey came and the matter was laid before them by M. de Cussy himself.\nHagthorpe announced at once that the proposal was opportune. The men\nwere grumbling at their protracted inaction, and would no doubt be ready\nto accept the service which M. de Cussy offered on behalf of France.\nHagthorpe looked at Blood as he spoke. Blood nodded gloomy agreement.\nEmboldened by this, they went on to discuss the terms. Yberville, the\nyoung French filibuster, had the honour to point out to M. de Cussy\nthat the share offered was too small. For one fifth of the prizes, the\nofficers would answer for their men; not for less.\n\nM. de Cussy was distressed. He had his instructions. It was taking a\ndeal upon himself to exceed them. The buccaneers were firm. Unless M. de\nCussy could make it one fifth there was no more to be said. M. de Cussy\nfinally consenting to exceed his instructions, the articles were drawn\nup and signed that very day. The buccaneers were to be at Petit Goave\nby the end of January, when M. de Rivarol had announced that he might be\nexpected.\n\nAfter that followed days of activity in Tortuga, refitting the ships,\nboucanning meat, laying in stores. In these matters which once would\nhave engaged all Captain Blood's attention, he now took no part.\nHe continued listless and aloof. If he had given his consent to the\nundertaking, or, rather, allowed himself to be swept into it by the\nwishes of his officers--it was only because the service offered was of a\nregular and honourable kind, nowise connected with piracy, with which he\nswore in his heart that he had done for ever. But his consent remained\npassive. The service entered awoke no zeal in him. He was perfectly\nindifferent--as he told Hagthorpe, who ventured once to offer a\nremonstrance--whether they went to Petit Goave or to Hades, and whether\nthey entered the service of Louis XIV or of Satan.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI. M. de RIVAROL\n\n\nCaptain Blood was still in that disgruntled mood when he sailed from\nTortuga, and still in that mood when he came to his moorings in the bay\nof Petit Goave. In that same mood he greeted M. le Baron de Rivarol when\nthis nobleman with his fleet of five men-of-war at last dropped anchor\nalongside the buccaneer ships, in the middle of February. The Frenchman\nhad been six weeks on the voyage, he announced, delayed by unfavourable\nweather.\n\nSummoned to wait on him, Captain Blood repaired to the Castle of\nPetit Goave, where the interview was to take place. The Baron, a tall,\nhawk-faced man of forty, very cold and distant of manner, measured\nCaptain Blood with an eye of obvious disapproval. Of Hagthorpe,\nYberville, and Wolverstone who stood ranged behind their captain, he\ntook no heed whatever. M. de Cussy offered Captain Blood a chair.\n\n\"A moment, M. de Cussy. I do not think M. le Baron has observed that\nI am not alone. Let me present to you, sir, my companions: Captain\nHagthorpe of the Elizabeth, Captain Wolverstone of the Atropos, and\nCaptain Yberville of the Lachesis.\"\n\nThe Baron stared hard and haughtily at Captain Blood, then very\ndistantly and barely perceptibly inclined his head to each of the other\nthree. His manner implied plainly that he despised them and that he\ndesired them at once to understand it. It had a curious effect upon\nCaptain Blood. It awoke the devil in him, and it awoke at the same time\nhis self-respect which of late had been slumbering. A sudden shame of\nhis disordered, ill-kempt appearance made him perhaps the more defiant.\nThere was almost a significance in the way he hitched his sword-belt\nround, so that the wrought hilt of his very serviceable rapier was\nbrought into fuller view. He waved his captains to the chairs that stood\nabout.\n\n\"Draw up to the table, lads. We are keeping the Baron waiting.\"\n\nThey obeyed him, Wolverstone with a grin that was full of understanding.\nHaughtier grew the stare of M. de Rivarol. To sit at table with these\nbandits placed him upon what he accounted a dishonouring equality.\nIt had been his notion that--with the possible exception of Captain\nBlood--they should take his instructions standing, as became men of\ntheir quality in the presence of a man of his. He did the only thing\nremaining to mark a distinction between himself and them. He put on his\nhat.\n\n\"Ye're very wise now,\" said Blood amiably. \"I feel the draught myself.\"\nAnd he covered himself with his plumed castor.\n\nM. de Rivarol changed colour. He quivered visibly with anger, and was\na moment controlling himself before venturing to speak. M. de Cussy was\nobviously very ill at ease.\n\n\"Sir,\" said the Baron frostily, \"you compel me to remind you that the\nrank you hold is that of Capitaine de Vaisseau, and that you are in\nthe presence of the General of the Armies of France by Sea and Land in\nAmerica. You compel me to remind you further that there is a deference\ndue from your rank to mine.\"\n\n\"I am happy to assure you,\" said Captain Blood, \"that the reminder is\nunnecessary. I am by way of accounting myself a gentleman, little though\nI may look like one at present; and I should not account myself that\nwere I capable of anything but deference to those whom nature or fortune\nmay have placed above me, or to those who being placed beneath me in\nrank may labour under a disability to resent my lack of it.\" It was a\nneatly intangible rebuke. M. de Rivarol bit his lip. Captain Blood swept\non without giving him time to reply: \"Thus much being clear, shall we\ncome to business?\"\n\nM. de Rivarol's hard eyes considered him a moment. \"Perhaps it will be\nbest,\" said he. He took up a paper. \"I have here a copy of the articles\ninto which you entered with M. de Cussy. Before going further, I have to\nobserve that M. de Cussy has exceeded his instructions in admitting\nyou to one fifth of the prizes taken. His authority did not warrant his\ngoing beyond one tenth.\"\n\n\"That is a matter between yourself and M. de Cussy, my General.\"\n\n\"Oh, no. It is a matter between myself and you.\"\n\n\"Your pardon, my General. The articles are signed. So far as we are\nconcerned, the matter is closed. Also out of regard for M. de Cussy, we\nshould not desire to be witnesses of the rebukes you may consider that\nhe deserves.\"\n\n\"What I may have to say to M. de Cussy is no concern of yours.\"\n\n\"That is what I am telling you, my General.\"\n\n\"But--nom de Dieu!--it is your concern, I suppose, that we cannot\naward you more than one tenth share.\" M. de Rivarol smote the table in\nexasperation. This pirate was too infernally skillful a fencer.\n\n\"You are quite certain of that, M. le Baron--that you cannot?\"\n\n\"I am quite certain that I will not.\"\n\nCaptain Blood shrugged, and looked down his nose. \"In that case,\"\nsaid he, \"it but remains for me to present my little account for our\ndisbursement, and to fix the sum at which we should be compensated for\nour loss of time and derangement in coming hither. That settled, we can\npart friends, M. le Baron. No harm has been done.\"\n\n\"What the devil do you mean?\" The Baron was on his feet, leaning forward\nacross the table.\n\n\"Is it possible that I am obscure? My French, perhaps, is not of the\npurest, but....\"\n\n\"Oh, your French is fluent enough; too fluent at moments, if I may\npermit myself the observation. Now, look you here, M. le filibustier, I\nam not a man with whom it is safe to play the fool, as you may very soon\ndiscover. You have accepted service of the King of France--you and your\nmen; you hold the rank and draw the pay of a Capitaine de Vaisseau,\nand these your officers hold the rank of lieutenants. These ranks carry\nobligations which you would do well to study, and penalties for failing\nto discharge them which you might study at the same time. They are\nsomething severe. The first obligation of an officer is obedience. I\ncommend it to your attention. You are not to conceive yourselves, as you\nappear to be doing, my allies in the enterprises I have in view, but my\nsubordinates. In me you behold a commander to lead you, not a companion\nor an equal. You understand me, I hope.\"\n\n\"Oh, be sure that I understand,\" Captain Blood laughed. He was\nrecovering his normal self amazingly under the inspiring stimulus of\nconflict. The only thing that marred his enjoyment was the reflection\nthat he had not shaved. \"I forget nothing, I assure you, my General.\nI do not forget, for instance, as you appear to be doing, that the\narticles we signed are the condition of our service; and the articles\nprovide that we receive one-fifth share. Refuse us that, and you cancel\nthe articles; cancel the articles, and you cancel our services with\nthem. From that moment we cease to have the honour to hold rank in the\nnavies of the King of France.\"\n\nThere was more than a murmur of approval from his three captains.\n\nRivarol glared at them, checkmated.\n\n\"In effect...\" M. de Cussy was beginning timidly.\n\n\"In effect, monsieur, this is your doing,\" the Baron flashed on him,\nglad to have some one upon whom he could fasten the sharp fangs of his\nirritation. \"You should be broke for it. You bring the King's service\ninto disrepute; you force me, His Majesty's representative, into an\nimpossible position.\"\n\n\"Is it impossible to award us the one-fifth share?\" quoth Captain Blood\nsilkily. \"In that case, there is no need for beat or for injuries to\nM. de Cussy. M. de Cussy knows that we would not have come for less.\nWe depart again upon your assurance that you cannot award us more. And\nthings are as they would have been if M. de Cussy had adhered rigidly\nto his instructions. I have proved, I hope, to your satisfaction, M.\nle Baron, that if you repudiate the articles you can neither claim our\nservices nor hinder our departure--not in honour.\"\n\n\"Not in honour, sir? To the devil with your insolence! Do you imply that\nany course that were not in honour would be possible to me?\"\n\n\"I do not imply it, because it would not be possible,\" said Captain\nBlood. \"We should see to that. It is, my General, for you to say whether\nthe articles are repudiated.\"\n\nThe Baron sat down. \"I will consider the matter,\" he said sullenly. \"You\nshall be advised of my resolve.\"\n\nCaptain Blood rose, his officers rose with him. Captain Blood bowed.\n\n\"M. le Baron!\" said he.\n\nThen he and his buccaneers removed themselves from the August and irate\npresence of the General of the King's Armies by Land and Sea in America.\n\nYou conceive that there followed for M. de Cussy an extremely bad\nquarter of an hour. M. de Cussy, in fact, deserves your sympathy. His\nself-sufficiency was blown from him by the haughty M. de Rivarol, as\ndown from a thistle by the winds of autumn. The General of the King's\nArmies abused him--this man who was Governor of Hispaniola--as if he\nwere a lackey. M. de Cussy defended himself by urging the thing that\nCaptain Blood had so admirably urged already on his behalf--that if the\nterms he had made with the buccaneers were not confirmed there was no\nharm done. M. de Rivarol bullied and browbeat him into silence.\n\nHaving exhausted abuse, the Baron proceeded to indignities. Since he\naccounted that M. de Cussy had proved himself unworthy of the post he\nheld, M. de Rivarol took over the responsibilities of that post for as\nlong as he might remain in Hispaniola, and to give effect to this he\nbegan by bringing soldiers from his ships, and setting his own guard in\nM. de Cussy's castle.\n\nOut of this, trouble followed quickly. Wolverstone coming ashore next\nmorning in the picturesque garb that he affected, his head swathed in a\ncoloured handkerchief, was jeered at by an officer of the newly landed\nFrench troops. Not accustomed to derision, Wolverstone replied in kind\nand with interest. The officer passed to insult, and Wolverstone struck\nhim a blow that felled him, and left him only the half of his poor\nsenses. Within the hour the matter was reported to M. de Rivarol, and\nbefore noon, by M. de Rivarol's orders, Wolverstone was under arrest in\nthe castle.\n\nThe Baron had just sat down to dinner with M. de Cussy when the negro\nwho waited on them announced Captain Blood. Peevishly M. de Rivarol bade\nhim be admitted, and there entered now into his presence a spruce and\nmodish gentleman, dressed with care and sombre richness in black and\nsilver, his swarthy, clear-cut face scrupulously shaven, his long black\nhair in ringlets that fell to a collar of fine point. In his right hand\nthe gentleman carried a broad black hat with a scarlet ostrich-plume,\nin his left hand an ebony cane. His stockings were of silk, a bunch of\nribbons masked his garters, and the black rosettes on his shoes were\nfinely edged with gold.\n\nFor a moment M. de Rivarol did not recognize him. For Blood looked\nyounger by ten years than yesterday. But the vivid blue eyes under their\nlevel black brows were not to be forgotten, and they proclaimed him for\nthe man announced even before he had spoken. His resurrected pride had\ndemanded that he should put himself on an equality with the baron and\nadvertise that equality by his exterior.\n\n\"I come inopportunely,\" he courteously excused himself. \"My apologies.\nMy business could not wait. It concerns, M. de Cussy, Captain\nWolverstone of the Lachesis, whom you have placed under arrest.\"\n\n\"It was I who placed him under arrest,\" said M. de Rivarol.\n\n\"Indeed! But I thought that M. de Cussy was Governor of Hispaniola.\"\n\n\"Whilst I am here, monsieur, I am the supreme authority. It is as well\nthat you should understand it.\"\n\n\"Perfectly. But it is not possible that you are aware of the mistake\nthat has been made.\"\n\n\"Mistake, do you say?\"\n\n\"I say mistake. On the whole, it is polite of me to use that word. Also\nit is expedient. It will save discussions. Your people have arrested the\nwrong man, M. de Rivarol. Instead of the French officer, who used the\ngrossest provocation, they have arrested Captain Wolverstone. It is a\nmatter which I beg you to reverse without delay.\"\n\nM. de Rivarol's hawk-face flamed scarlet. His dark eyes bulged.\n\n\"Sir, you... you are insolent! But of an insolence that is intolerable!\"\nNormally a man of the utmost self-possession he was so rudely shaken now\nthat he actually stammered.\n\n\"M. le Baron, you waste words. This is the New World. It is not merely\nnew; it is novel to one reared amid the superstitions of the Old. That\nnovelty you have not yet had time, perhaps, to realize; therefore I\noverlook the offensive epithet you have used. But justice is justice in\nthe New World as in the Old, and injustice as intolerable here as there.\nNow justice demands the enlargement of my officer and the arrest and\npunishment of yours. That justice I invite you, with submission, to\nadminister.\"\n\n\"With submission?\" snorted the Baron in furious scorn.\n\n\"With the utmost submission, monsieur. But at the same time I will\nremind M. le Baron that my buccaneers number eight hundred; your troops\nfive hundred; and M. de Cussy will inform you of the interesting fact\nthat any one buccaneer is equal in action to at least three soldiers of\nthe line. I am perfectly frank with you, monsieur, to save time and hard\nwords. Either Captain Wolverstone is instantly set at liberty, or we\nmust take measures to set him at liberty ourselves. The consequences may\nbe appalling. But it is as you please, M. le Baron. You are the supreme\nauthority. It is for you to say.\"\n\nM. de Rivarol was white to the lips. In all his life he had never been\nso bearded and defied. But he controlled himself.\n\n\"You will do me the favour to wait in the ante-room, M. le Capitaine.\nI desire a word with M. de Cussy. You shall presently be informed of my\ndecision.\"\n\nWhen the door had closed, the baron loosed his fury upon the head of M.\nde Cussy.\n\n\"So, these are the men you have enlisted in the King's service, the men\nwho are to serve under me--men who do not serve, but dictate, and this\nbefore the enterprise that has brought me from France is even under way!\nWhat explanations do you offer me, M. de Cussy? I warn you that I am\nnot pleased with you. I am, in fact, as you may perceive, exceedingly\nangry.\"\n\nThe Governor seemed to shed his chubbiness. He drew himself stiffly\nerect.\n\n\"Your rank, monsieur, does not give you the right to rebuke me; nor\ndo the facts. I have enlisted for you the men that you desired me to\nenlist. It is not my fault if you do not know how to handle them better.\nAs Captain Blood has told you, this is the New World.\"\n\n\"So, so!\" M. de Rivarol smiled malignantly. \"Not only do you offer no\nexplanation, but you venture to put me in the wrong. Almost I admire\nyour temerity. But there!\" he waved the matter aside. He was supremely\nsardonic. \"It is, you tell me, the New World, and--new worlds, new\nmanners, I suppose. In time I may conform my ideas to this new world, or\nI may conform this new world to my ideas.\" He was menacing on that. \"For\nthe moment I must accept what I find. It remains for you, monsieur,\nwho have experience of these savage by-ways, to advise me out of that\nexperience how to act.\"\n\n\"M. le Baron, it was a folly to have arrested the buccaneer captain. It\nwould be madness to persist. We have not the forces to meet force.\"\n\n\"In that case, monsieur, perhaps you will tell me what we are to do with\nregard to the future. Am I to submit at every turn to the dictates\nof this man Blood? Is the enterprise upon which we are embarked to be\nconducted as he decrees? Am I, in short, the King's representative in\nAmerica, to be at the mercy of these rascals?\"\n\n\"Oh, by no means. I am enrolling volunteers here in Hispaniola, and I\nam raising a corps of negroes. I compute that when this is done we shall\nhave a force of a thousand men, the buccaneers apart.\"\n\n\"But in that case why not dispense with them?\"\n\n\"Because they will always remain the sharp edge of any weapon that we\nforge. In the class of warfare that lies before us they are so skilled\nthat what Captain Blood has just said is not an overstatement. A\nbuccaneer is equal to three soldiers of the line. At the same time we\nshall have a sufficient force to keep them in control. For the rest,\nmonsieur, they have certain notions of honour. They will stand by their\narticles, and so that we deal justly with them, they will deal justly\nwith us, and give no trouble. I have experience of them, and I pledge\nyou my word for that.\"\n\nM. de Rivarol condescended to be mollified. It was necessary that he\nshould save his face, and in a degree the Governor afforded him the\nmeans to do so, as well as a certain guarantee for the future in the\nfurther force he was raising.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said. \"Be so good as to recall this Captain Blood.\"\n\nThe Captain came in, assured and very dignified. M. de Rivarol found him\ndetestable; but dissembled it.\n\n\"M. le Capitaine, I have taken counsel with M. le Gouverneur. From what\nhe tells me, it is possible that a mistake has been committed. Justice,\nyou may be sure, shall be done. To ensure it, I shall myself preside\nover a council to be composed of two of my senior officers, yourself\nand an officer of yours. This council shall hold at once an impartial\ninvestigation into the affair, and the offender, the man guilty of\nhaving given provocation, shall be punished.\"\n\nCaptain Blood bowed. It was not his wish to be extreme. \"Perfectly, M.\nle Baron. And now, sir, you have had the night for reflection in this\nmatter of the articles. Am I to understand that you confirm or that you\nrepudiate them?\"\n\nM. de Rivarol's eyes narrowed. His mind was full of what M. de Cussy had\nsaid--that these buccaneers must prove the sharp edge of any weapon he\nmight forge. He could not dispense with them. He perceived that he\nhad blundered tactically in attempting to reduce the agreed share.\nWithdrawal from a position of that kind is ever fraught with loss of\ndignity. But there were those volunteers that M. de Cussy was enrolling\nto strengthen the hand of the King's General. Their presence might admit\nanon of the reopening of this question. Meanwhile he must retire in the\nbest order possible.\n\n\"I have considered that, too,\" he announced. \"And whilst my opinion\nremains unaltered, I must confess that since M. de Cussy has pledged us,\nit is for us to fulfil the pledges. The articles are confirmed, sir.\"\n\nCaptain Blood bowed again. In vain M. de Rivarol looked searchingly\nfor the least trace of a smile of triumph on those firm lips. The\nbuccaneer's face remained of the utmost gravity.\n\nWolverstone was set at liberty that afternoon, and his assailant\nsentenced to two months' detention. Thus harmony was restored. But it\nhad been an unpromising beginning, and there was more to follow shortly\nof a similar discordant kind.\n\nBlood and his officers were summoned a week later to a council which sat\nto determine their operations against Spain. M. de Rivarol laid before\nthem a project for a raid upon the wealthy Spanish town of Cartagena.\nCaptain Blood professed astonishment. Sourly invited by M. de Rivarol to\nstate his grounds for it, he did so with the utmost frankness.\n\n\"Were I General of the King's Armies in America,\" said he, \"I should\nhave no doubt or hesitation as to the best way in which to serve my\nRoyal master and the French nation. That which I think will be obvious\nto M. de Cussy, as it is to me, is that we should at once invade Spanish\nHispaniola and reduce the whole of this fruitful and splendid island\ninto the possession of the King of France.\"\n\n\"That may follow,\" said M. de Rivarol. \"It is my wish that we begin with\nCartagena.\"\n\n\"You mean, sir, that we are to sail across the Caribbean on an\nadventurous expedition, neglecting that which lies here at our very\ndoor. In our absence, a Spanish invasion of French Hispaniola is\npossible. If we begin by reducing the Spaniards here, that possibility\nwill be removed. We shall have added to the Crown of France the\nmost coveted possession in the West Indies. The enterprise offers\nno particular difficulty; it may be speedily accomplished, and once\naccomplished, it would be time to look farther afield. That would seem\nthe logical order in which this campaign should proceed.\"\n\nHe ceased, and there was silence. M. de Rivarol sat back in his chair,\nthe feathered end of a quill between his teeth. Presently he cleared his\nthroat and asked a question.\n\n\"Is there anybody else who shares Captain Blood's opinion?\"\n\nNone answered him. His own officers were overawed by him; Blood's\nfollowers naturally preferred Cartagena, because offering the greater\nchance of loot. Loyalty to their leader kept them silent.\n\n\"You seem to be alone in your opinion,\" said the Baron with his vinegary\nsmile.\n\nCaptain Blood laughed outright. He had suddenly read the Baron's mind.\nHis airs and graces and haughtiness had so imposed upon Blood that\nit was only now that at last he saw through them, into the fellow's\npeddling spirit. Therefore he laughed; there was really nothing else to\ndo. But his laughter was charged with more anger even than contempt. He\nhad been deluding himself that he had done with piracy. The conviction\nthat this French service was free of any taint of that was the only\nconsideration that had induced him to accept it. Yet here was this\nhaughty, supercilious gentleman, who dubbed himself General of the\nArmies of France, proposing a plundering, thieving raid which, when\nstripped of its mean, transparent mask of legitimate warfare, was\nrevealed as piracy of the most flagrant.\n\nM. de Rivarol, intrigued by his mirth, scowled upon him disapprovingly.\n\n\"Why do you laugh, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Because I discover here an irony that is supremely droll. You, M. le\nBaron, General of the King's Armies by Land and Sea in America,\npropose an enterprise of a purely buccaneering character; whilst I,\nthe buccaneer, am urging one that is more concerned with upholding the\nhonour of France. You perceive how droll it is.\"\n\nM. de Rivarol perceived nothing of the kind. M. de Rivarol in fact was\nextremely angry. He bounded to his feet, and every man in the room rose\nwith him--save only M. de Cussy, who sat on with a grim smile on his\nlips. He, too, now read the Baron like an open book, and reading him\ndespised him.\n\n\"M. le filibustier,\" cried Rivarol in a thick voice, \"it seems that I\nmust again remind you that I am your superior officer.\"\n\n\"My superior officer! You! Lord of the World! Why, you are just a common\npirate! But you shall hear the truth for once, and that before all these\ngentlemen who have the honour to serve the King of France. It is for\nme, a buccaneer, a sea-robber, to stand here and tell you what is in the\ninterest of French honour and the French Crown. Whilst you, the French\nKing's appointed General, neglecting this, are for spending the King's\nresources against an outlying settlement of no account, shedding French\nblood in seizing a place that cannot be held, only because it has been\nreported to you that there is much gold in Cartagena, and that the\nplunder of it will enrich you. It is worthy of the huckster who sought\nto haggle with us about our share, and to beat us down after the\narticles pledging you were already signed. If I am wrong--let M. de\nCussy say so. If I am wrong, let me be proven wrong, and I will beg your\npardon. Meanwhile, monsieur, I withdraw from this council. I will have\nno further part in your deliberations. I accepted the service of the\nKing of France with intent to honour that service. I cannot honour that\nservice by lending countenance to a waste of life and resources in raids\nupon unimportant settlements, with plunder for their only object. The\nresponsibility for such decisions must rest with you, and with you\nalone. I desire M. de Cussy to report me to the Ministers of France. For\nthe rest, monsieur, it merely remains for you to give me your orders. I\nawait them aboard my ship--and anything else, of a personal nature, that\nyou may feel I have provoked by the terms I have felt compelled to use\nin this council. M. le Baron, I have the honour to wish you good-day.\"\n\nHe stalked out, and his three captains--although they thought him\nmad--rolled after him in loyal silence.\n\nM. de Rivarol was gasping like a landed fish. The stark truth had robbed\nhim of speech. When he recovered, it was to thank Heaven vigorously that\nthe council was relieved by Captain Blood's own act of that gentleman's\nfurther participation in its deliberations. Inwardly M. de Rivarol\nburned with shame and rage. The mask had been plucked from him, and he\nhad been held up to scorn--he, the General of the King's Armies by Sea\nand Land in America.\n\nNevertheless, it was to Cartagena that they sailed in the middle of\nMarch. Volunteers and negroes had brought up the forces directly under\nM. de Rivarol to twelve hundred men. With these he thought he could keep\nthe buccaneer contingent in order and submissive.\n\nThey made up an imposing fleet, led by M. de Rivarol's flagship, the\nVictorieuse, a mighty vessel of eighty guns. Each of the four other\nFrench ships was at least as powerful as Blood's Arabella, which was\nof forty guns. Followed the lesser buccaneer vessels, the Elizabeth,\nLachesis, and Atropos, and a dozen frigates laden with stores, besides\ncanoes and small craft in tow.\n\nNarrowly they missed the Jamaica fleet with Colonel Bishop, which\nsailed north for Tortuga two days after the Baron de Rivarol's southward\npassage.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII. CARTAGENA\n\n\nHaving crossed the Caribbean in the teeth of contrary winds, it was not\nuntil the early days of April that the French fleet hove in sight of\nCartagena, and M. de Rivarol summoned a council aboard his flagship to\ndetermine the method of assault.\n\n\"It is of importance, messieurs,\" he told them, \"that we take the city\nby surprise, not only before it can put itself into a state of defence;\nbut before it can remove its treasures inland. I propose to land a\nforce sufficient to achieve this to the north of the city to-night after\ndark.\" And he explained in detail the scheme upon which his wits had\nlaboured.\n\nHe was heard respectfully and approvingly by his officers, scornfully\nby Captain Blood, and indifferently by the other buccaneer captains\npresent. For it must be understood that Blood's refusal to attend\ncouncils had related only to those concerned with determining the nature\nof the enterprise to be undertaken.\n\nCaptain Blood was the only one amongst them who knew exactly what lay\nahead. Two years ago he had himself considered a raid upon the place,\nand he had actually made a survey of it in circumstances which he was\npresently to disclose.\n\nThe Baron's proposal was one to be expected from a commander whose\nknowledge of Cartagena was only such as might be derived from maps.\n\nGeographically and strategically considered, it is a curious place. It\nstands almost four-square, screened east and north by hills, and it\nmay be said to face south upon the inner of two harbours by which it\nis normally approached. The entrance to the outer harbour, which is in\nreality a lagoon some three miles across, lies through a neck known as\nthe Boca Chica--or Little Mouth--and defended by a fort. A long strip of\ndensely wooded land to westward acts here as a natural breakwater, and\nas the inner harbour is approached, another strip of land thrusts across\nat right angles from the first, towards the mainland on the east. Just\nshort of this it ceases, leaving a deep but very narrow channel, a\nveritable gateway, into the secure and sheltered inner harbour. Another\nfort defends this second passage. East and north of Cartagena lies\nthe mainland, which may be left out of account. But to the west and\nnorthwest this city, so well guarded on every other side, lies directly\nopen to the sea. It stands back beyond a half-mile of beach, and besides\nthis and the stout Walls which fortify it, would appear to have no other\ndefences. But those appearances are deceptive, and they had utterly\ndeceived M. de Rivarol, when he devised his plan.\n\nIt remained for Captain Blood to explain the difficulties when M. de\nRivarol informed him that the honour of opening the assault in the\nmanner which he prescribed was to be accorded to the buccaneers.\n\nCaptain Blood smiled sardonic appreciation of the honour reserved\nfor his men. It was precisely what he would have expected. For the\nbuccaneers the dangers; for M. de Rivarol the honour, glory and profit\nof the enterprise.\n\n\"It is an honour which I must decline,\" said he quite coldly.\n\nWolverstone grunted approval and Hagthorpe nodded. Yberville, who\nas much as any of them resented the superciliousness of his noble\ncompatriot, never wavered in loyalty to Captain Blood. The French\nofficers--there were six of them present--stared their haughty surprise\nat the buccaneer leader, whilst the Baron challengingly fired a question\nat him.\n\n\"How? You decline it, 'sir? You decline to obey orders, do you say?\"\n\n\"I understood, M. le Baron, that you summoned us to deliberate upon the\nmeans to be adopted.\"\n\n\"Then you understood amiss, M. le Capitaine. You are here to receive\nmy commands. I have already deliberated, and I have decided. I hope you\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"Oh, I understand,\" laughed Blood. \"But, I ask myself, do you?\" And\nwithout giving the Baron time to set the angry question that was\nbubbling to his lips, he swept on: \"You have deliberated, you say, and\nyou have decided. But unless your decision rests upon a wish to destroy\nmy buccaneers, you will alter it when I tell you something of which\nI have knowledge. This city of Cartagena looks very vulnerable on\nthe northern side, all open to the sea as it apparently stands. Ask\nyourself, M. le Baron, how came the Spaniards who built it where it is\nto have been at such trouble to fortify it to the south, if from the\nnorth it is so easily assailable.\"\n\nThat gave M. de Rivarol pause.\n\n\"The Spaniards,\" Blood pursued, \"are not quite the fools you are\nsupposing them. Let me tell you, messieurs, that two years ago I made a\nsurvey of Cartagena as a preliminary to raiding it. I came hither with\nsome friendly trading Indians, myself disguised as an Indian, and in\nthat guise I spent a week in the city and studied carefully all its\napproaches. On the side of the sea where it looks so temptingly open to\nassault, there is shoal water for over half a mile out--far enough out,\nI assure you, to ensure that no ship shall come within bombarding range\nof it. It is not safe to venture nearer land than three quarters of a\nmile.\"\n\n\"But our landing will be effected in canoes and piraguas and open\nboats,\" cried an officer impatiently.\n\n\"In the calmest season of the year, the surf will hinder any such\noperation. And you will also bear in mind that if landing were possible\nas you are suggesting, that landing could not be covered by the ships'\nguns. In fact, it is the landing parties would be in danger from their\nown artillery.\"\n\n\"If the attack is made by night, as I propose, covering will be\nunnecessary. You should be ashore in force before the Spaniards are\naware of the intent.\"\n\n\"You are assuming that Cartagena is a city of the blind, that at this\nvery moment they are not conning our sails and asking themselves who we\nare and what we intend.\"\n\n\"But if they feel themselves secure from the north, as you suggest,\"\ncried the Baron impatiently, \"that very security will lull them.\"\n\n\"Perhaps. But, then, they are secure. Any attempt to land on this side\nis doomed to failure at the hands of Nature.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, we make the attempt,\" said the obstinate Baron, whose\nhaughtiness would not allow him to yield before his officers.\n\n\"If you still choose to do so after what I have said, you are, of\ncourse, the person to decide. But I do not lead my men into fruitless\ndanger.\"\n\n\"If I command you...\" the Baron was beginning. But Blood unceremoniously\ninterrupted him.\n\n\"M. le Baron, when M. de Cussy engaged us on your behalf, it was as much\non account of our knowledge and experience of this class of warfare\nas on account of our strength. I have placed my own knowledge and\nexperience in this particular matter at your disposal. I will add that\nI abandoned my own project of raiding Cartagena, not being in sufficient\nstrength at the time to force the entrance of the harbour, which is the\nonly way into the city. The strength which you now command is ample for\nthat purpose.\"\n\n\"But whilst we are doing that, the Spaniards will have time to\nremove great part of the wealth this city holds. We must take them by\nsurprise.\"\n\nCaptain Blood shrugged. \"If this is a mere pirating raid, that, of\ncourse, is a prime consideration. It was with me. But if you are\nconcerned to abate the pride of Spain and plant the Lilies of France\non the forts of this settlement, the loss of some treasure should not\nreally weigh for much.\"\n\nM. de Rivarol bit his lip in chagrin. His gloomy eye smouldered as it\nconsidered the self-contained buccaneer.\n\n\"But if I command you to go--to make the attempt?\" he asked. \"Answer me,\nmonsieur, let us know once for all where we stand, and who commands this\nexpedition.\"\n\n\"Positively, I find you tiresome,\" said Captain Blood, and he swung to\nM. de Cussy, who sat there gnawing his lip, intensely uncomfortable. \"I\nappeal to you, monsieur, to justify me to the General.\"\n\nM. de Cussy started out of his gloomy abstraction. He cleared his\nthroat. He was extremely nervous.\n\n\"In view of what Captain Blood has submitted....\"\n\n\"Oh, to the devil with that!\" snapped Rivarol. \"It seems that I am\nfollowed by poltroons. Look you, M. le Capitaine, since you are afraid\nto undertake this thing, I will myself undertake it. The weather is\ncalm, and I count upon making good my landing. If I do so, I shall have\nproved you wrong, and I shall have a word to say to you to-morrow which\nyou may not like. I am being very generous with you, sir.\" He waved his\nhand regally. \"You have leave to go.\"\n\nIt was sheer obstinacy and empty pride that drove him, and he received\nthe lesson he deserved. The fleet stood in during the afternoon to\nwithin a mile of the coast, and under cover of darkness three hundred\nmen, of whom two hundred were negroes--the whole of the negro contingent\nhaving been pressed into the undertaking--were pulled away for the shore\nin the canoes, piraguas, and ships' boats. Rivarol's pride compelled\nhim, however much he may have disliked the venture, to lead them in\nperson.\n\nThe first six boats were caught in the surf, and pounded into fragments\nbefore their occupants could extricate themselves. The thunder of the\nbreakers and the cries of the shipwrecked warned those who followed,\nand thereby saved them from sharing the same fate. By the Baron's urgent\norders they pulled away again out of danger, and stood about to pick\nup such survivors as contrived to battle towards them. Close upon fifty\nlives were lost in the adventure, together with half-a-dozen boats\nstored with ammunition and light guns.\n\nThe Baron went back to his flagship an infuriated, but by no means a\nwiser man. Wisdom--not even the pungent wisdom experience thrusts upon\nus--is not for such as M. de Rivarol. His anger embraced all things, but\nfocussed chiefly upon Captain Blood. In some warped process of reasoning\nhe held the buccaneer chiefly responsible for this misadventure. He went\nto bed considering furiously what he should say to Captain Blood upon\nthe morrow.\n\nHe was awakened at dawn by the rolling thunder of guns. Emerging upon\nthe poop in nightcap and slippers, he beheld a sight that increased his\nunreasonable and unreasoning fury. The four buccaneer ships under canvas\nwere going through extraordinary manoeuvre half a mile off the Boca\nChica and little more than half a mile away from the remainder of the\nfleet, and from their flanks flame and smoke were belching each time\nthey swung broadside to the great round fort that guarded that narrow\nentrance. The fort was returning the fire vigorously and viciously. But\nthe buccaneers timed their broadsides with extraordinary judgment to\ncatch the defending ordnance reloading; then as they drew the Spaniards'\nfire, they swung away again not only taking care to be ever moving\ntargets, but, further, to present no more than bow or stern to the fort,\ntheir masts in line, when the heaviest cannonades were to be expected.\n\nGibbering and cursing, M. de Rivarol stood there and watched this\naction, so presumptuously undertaken by Blood on his own responsibility.\nThe officers of the Victorieuse crowded round him, but it was not until\nM. de Cussy came to join the group that he opened the sluices of his\nrage. And M. de Cussy himself invited the deluge that now caught him.\nHe had come up rubbing his hands and taking a proper satisfaction in the\nenergy of the men whom he had enlisted.\n\n\"Aha, M. de Rivarol!\" he laughed. \"He understands his business, eh,\nthis Captain Blood. He'll plant the Lilies of France on that fort before\nbreakfast.\"\n\nThe Baron swung upon him snarling. \"He understands his business, eh? His\nbusiness, let me tell you, M. de Cussy, is to obey my orders, and I have\nnot ordered this. Par la Mordieu! When this is over I'll deal with him\nfor his damned insubordination.\"\n\n\"Surely, M. le Baron, he will have justified it if he succeeds.\"\n\n\"Justified it! Ah, parbleu! Can a soldier ever justify acting without\norders?\" He raved on furiously, his officers supporting him out of their\ndetestation of Captain Blood.\n\nMeanwhile the fight went merrily on. The fort was suffering badly. Yet\nfor all their manoeuvring the buccaneers were not escaping punishment.\nThe starboard gunwale of the Atropos had been hammered into splinters,\nand a shot had caught her astern in the coach. The Elizabeth was badly\nbattered about the forecastle, and the Arabella's maintop had been\nshot away, whilst' towards the end of that engagement the Lachesis came\nreeling out of the fight with a shattered rudder, steering herself by\nsweeps.\n\nThe absurd Baron's fierce eyes positively gleamed with satisfaction.\n\n\"I pray Heaven they may sink all his infernal ships!\" he cried in his\nfrenzy.\n\nBut Heaven didn't hear him. Scarcely had he spoken than there was a\nterrific explosion, and half the fort went up in fragments. A lucky shot\nfrom the buccaneers had found the powder magazine.\n\nIt may have been a couple of hours later, when Captain Blood, as\nspruce and cool as if he had just come from a levee, stepped upon the\nquarter-deck of the Victoriense, to confront M. de Rivarol, still in\nbedgown and nightcap.\n\n\"I have to report, M. le Baron, that we are in possession of the fort\non Boca Chica. The standard of France is flying from what remains of its\ntower, and the way into the outer harbour is open to your fleet.\"\n\nM. de Rivarol was compelled to swallow his fury, though it choked\nhim. The jubilation among his officers had been such that he could not\ncontinue as he had begun. Yet his eyes were malevolent, his face pale\nwith anger.\n\n\"You are fortunate, M. Blood, that you succeeded,\" he said. \"It would\nhave gone very ill with you had you failed. Another time be so good as\nto await my orders, lest you should afterwards lack the justification\nwhich your good fortune has procured you this morning.\"\n\nBlood smiled with a flash of white teeth, and bowed. \"I shall be glad of\nyour orders now, General, for pursuing our advantage. You realize that\nspeed in striking is the first essential.\"\n\nRivarol was left gaping a moment. Absorbed in his ridiculous anger, he\nhad considered nothing. But he made a quick recovery. \"To my cabin, if\nyou please,\" he commanded peremptorily, and was turning to lead the way,\nwhen Blood arrested him.\n\n\"With submission, my General, we shall be better here. You behold there\nthe scene of our coming action. It is spread before you like a map.\"\nHe waved his hand towards the lagoon, the country flanking it and\nthe considerable city standing back from the beach. \"If it is not a\npresumption in me to offer a suggestion....\" He paused. M. de Rivarol\nlooked at him sharply, suspecting irony. But the swarthy face was bland,\nthe keen eyes steady.\n\n\"Let us hear your suggestion,\" he consented.\n\nBlood pointed out the fort at the mouth of the inner harbour, which was\njust barely visible above the waving palms on the intervening tongue of\nland. He announced that its armament was less formidable than that\nof the outer fort, which they had reduced; but on the other hand, the\npassage was very much narrower than the Boca Chica, and before they\ncould attempt to make it in any case, they must dispose of those\ndefences. He proposed that the French ships should enter the outer\nharbour, and proceed at once to bombardment. Meanwhile, he would land\nthree hundred buccaneers and some artillery on the eastern side of the\nlagoon, beyond the fragrant garden islands dense with richly bearing\nfruit-trees, and proceed simultaneously to storm the fort in the rear.\nThus beset on both sides at once, and demoralized by the fate of the\nmuch stronger outer fort, he did not think the Spaniards would offer a\nvery long resistance. Then it would be for M. de Rivarol to garrison the\nfort, whilst Captain Blood would sweep on with his men, and seize\nthe Church of Nuestra Senora de la Poupa, plainly visible on its hill\nimmediately eastward of the town. Not only did that eminence afford them\na valuable and obvious strategic advantage, but it commanded the only\nroad that led from Cartagena to the interior, and once it were held\nthere would be no further question of the Spaniards attempting to remove\nthe wealth of the city.\n\nThat to M. de Rivarol was--as Captain Blood had judged that it would\nbe--the crowning argument. Supercilious until that moment, and disposed\nfor his own pride's sake to treat the buccaneer's suggestions with\ncavalier criticism, M. de Rivarol's manner suddenly changed. He became\nalert and brisk, went so far as tolerantly to commend Captain Blood's\nplan, and issued orders that action might be taken upon it at once.\n\nIt is not necessary to follow that action step by step. Blunders on\nthe part of the French marred its smooth execution, and the indifferent\nhandling of their ships led to the sinking of two of them in the course\nof the afternoon by the fort's gunfire. But by evening, owing largely to\nthe irresistible fury with which the buccaneers stormed the place from\nthe landward side, the fort had surrendered, and before dusk Blood and\nhis men with some ordnance hauled thither by mules dominated the city\nfrom the heights of Nuestra Senora de la Poupa.\n\nAt noon on the morrow, shorn of defences and threatened with\nbombardment, Cartagena sent offers of surrender to M. de Rivarol.\n\nSwollen with pride by a victory for which he took the entire credit\nto himself, the Baron dictated his terms. He demanded that all public\neffects and office accounts be delivered up; that the merchants\nsurrender all moneys and goods held by them for their correspondents;\nthe inhabitants could choose whether they would remain in the city or\ndepart; but those who went must first deliver up all their property, and\nthose who elected to remain must surrender half, and become the subjects\nof France; religious houses and churches should be spared, but they must\nrender accounts of all moneys and valuables in their possession.\n\nCartagena agreed, having no choice in the matter, and on the next\nday, which was the 5th of April, M. de Rivarol entered the city and\nproclaimed it now a French colony, appointing M. de Cussy its Governor.\nThereafter he proceeded to the Cathedral, where very properly a Te Deum\nwas sung in honour of the conquest. This by way of grace, whereafter M.\nde Rivarol proceeded to devour the city. The only detail in which the\nFrench conquest of Cartagena differed from an ordinary buccaneering raid\nwas that under the severest penalties no soldier was to enter the\nhouse of any inhabitant. But this apparent respect for the persons and\nproperty of the conquered was based in reality upon M. de Rivarol's\nanxiety lest a doubloon should be abstracted from all the wealth that\nwas pouring into the treasury opened by the Baron in the name of the\nKing of France. Once the golden stream had ceased, he removed all\nrestrictions and left the city in prey to his men, who proceeded further\nto pillage it of that part of their property which the inhabitants who\nbecame French subjects had been assured should remain inviolate. The\nplunder was enormous. In the course of four days over a hundred mules\nladen with gold went out of the city and down to the boats waiting at\nthe beach to convey the treasure aboard the ships.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII. THE HONOUR OF M. DE RIVAROL\n\n\nDuring the capitulation and for some time after, Captain Blood and the\ngreater portion of his buccaneers had been at their post on the heights\nof Nuestra Senora de la Poupa, utterly in ignorance of what was taking\nplace. Blood, although the man chiefly, if not solely, responsible\nfor the swift reduction of the city, which was proving a veritable\ntreasure-house, was not even shown the consideration of being called to\nthe council of officers which with M. de Rivarol determined the terms of\nthe capitulation.\n\nThis was a slight that at another time Captain Blood would not have\nborne for a moment. But at present, in his odd frame of mind, and its\ndivorcement from piracy, he was content to smile his utter contempt of\nthe French General. Not so, however, his captains, and still less\nhis men. Resentment smouldered amongst them for a while, to flame\nout violently at the end of that week in Cartagena. It was only by\nundertaking to voice their grievance to the Baron that their captain was\nable for the moment to pacify them. That done, he went at once in quest\nof M. de Rivarol.\n\nHe found him in the offices which the Baron had set up in the town, with\na staff of clerks to register the treasure brought in and to cast up the\nsurrendered account-books, with a view to ascertaining precisely what\nwere the sums yet to be delivered up. The Baron sat there scrutinizing\nledgers, like a city merchant, and checking figures to make sure that\nall was correct to the last peso. A choice occupation this for the\nGeneral of the King's Armies by Sea and Land. He looked up irritated by\nthe interruption which Captain Blood's advent occasioned.\n\n\"M. le Baron,\" the latter greeted him. \"I must speak frankly; and you\nmust suffer it. My men are on the point of mutiny.\"\n\nM. de Rivarol considered him with a faint lift of the eyebrows.\n\n\"Captain Blood, I, too, will speak frankly; and you, too, must suffer\nit. If there is a mutiny, you and your captains shall be held personally\nresponsible. The mistake you make is in assuming with me the tone of an\nally, whereas I have given you clearly to understand from the first that\nyou are simply in the position of having accepted service under me.\nYour proper apprehension of that fact will save the waste of a deal of\nwords.\"\n\nBlood contained himself with difficulty. One of these fine days, he\nfelt, that for the sake of humanity he must slit the comb of this\nsupercilious, arrogant cockerel.\n\n\"You may define our positions as you please,\" said he. \"But I'll remind\nyou that the nature of a thing is not changed by the name you give it.\nI am concerned with facts; chiefly with the fact that we entered\ninto definite articles with you. Those articles provide for a certain\ndistribution of the spoil. My men demand it. They are not satisfied.\"\n\n\"Of what are they not satisfied?\" demanded the Baron.\n\n\"Of your honesty, M. de Rivarol.\"\n\nA blow in the face could scarcely have taken the Frenchman more aback.\nHe stiffened, and drew himself up, his eyes blazing, his face of a\ndeathly pallor. The clerks at the tables laid down their pens, and\nawaited the explosion in a sort of terror.\n\nFor a long moment there was silence. Then the great gentleman delivered\nhimself in a voice of concentrated anger. \"Do you really dare so much,\nyou and the dirty thieves that follow you? God's Blood! You shall answer\nto me for that word, though it entail a yet worse dishonour to meet you.\nFaugh!\"\n\n\"I will remind you,\" said Blood, \"that I am speaking not for myself,\nbut for my men. It is they who are not satisfied, they who threaten that\nunless satisfaction is afforded them, and promptly, they will take it.\"\n\n\"Take it?\" said Rivarol, trembling in his rage. \"Let them attempt it,\nand....\"\n\n\"Now don't be rash. My men are within their rights, as you are aware.\nThey demand to know when this sharing of the spoil is to take place, and\nwhen they are to receive the fifth for which their articles provide.\"\n\n\"God give me patience! How can we share the spoil before it has been\ncompletely gathered?\"\n\n\"My men have reason to believe that it is gathered; and, anyway, they\nview with mistrust that it should all be housed aboard your ships, and\nremain in your possession. They say that hereafter there will be no\nascertaining what the spoil really amounts to.\"\n\n\"But--name of Heaven!--I have kept books. They are there for all to\nsee.\"\n\n\"They do not wish to see account-books. Few of them can read. They want\nto view the treasure itself. They know--you compel me to be blunt--that\nthe accounts have been falsified. Your books show the spoil of Cartagena\nto amount to some ten million livres. The men know--and they are very\nskilled in these computations--that it exceeds the enormous total of\nforty millions. They insist that the treasure itself be produced and\nweighed in their presence, as is the custom among the Brethren of the\nCoast.\"\n\n\"I know nothing of filibuster customs.\" The gentleman was disdainful.\n\n\"But you are learning quickly.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, you rogue? I am a leader of armies, not of plundering\nthieves.\"\n\n\"Oh, but of course!\" Blood's irony laughed in his eyes. \"Yet, whatever\nyou may be, I warn you that unless you yield to a demand that I consider\njust and therefore uphold, you may look for trouble, and it would not\nsurprise me if you never leave Cartagena at all, nor convey a single\ngold piece home to France.\"\n\n\"Ah, pardieu! Am I to understand that you are threatening me?\"\n\n\"Come, come, M. le Baron! I warn you of the trouble that a little\nprudence may avert. You do not know on what a volcano you are sitting.\nYou do not know the ways of buccaneers. If you persist, Cartagena will\nbe drenched in blood, and whatever the outcome the King of France will\nnot have been well served.\"\n\nThat shifted the basis of the argument to less hostile ground. Awhile\nyet it continued, to be concluded at last by an ungracious undertaking\nfrom M. de Rivarol to submit to the demands of the buccaneers. He gave\nit with an extreme ill-grace, and only because Blood made him realize at\nlast that to withhold it longer would be dangerous. In an engagement,\nhe might conceivably defeat Blood's followers. But conceivably he might\nnot. And even if he succeeded, the effort would be so costly to him in\nmen that he might not thereafter find himself in sufficient strength to\nmaintain his hold of what he had seized.\n\nThe end of it all was that he gave a promise at once to make the\nnecessary preparations, and if Captain Blood and his officers would wait\nupon him on board the Victorieuse to-morrow morning, the treasure\nshould be produced, weighed in their presence, and their fifth share\nsurrendered there and then into their own keeping.\n\nAmong the buccaneers that night there was hilarity over the sudden\nabatement of M. de Rivarol's monstrous pride. But when the next dawn\nbroke over Cartagena, they had the explanation of it. The only ships\nto be seen in the harbour were the Arabella and the Elizabeth riding\nat anchor, and the Atropos and the Lachesis careened on the beach for\nrepair of the damage sustained in the bombardment. The French ships were\ngone. They had been quietly and secretly warped out of the harbour under\ncover of night, and three sails, faint and small, on the horizon to\nwestward was all that remained to be seen of them. The absconding M. de\nRivarol had gone off with the treasure, taking with him the troops and\nmariners he had brought from France. He had left behind him at Cartagena\nnot only the empty-handed buccaneers, whom he had swindled, but also\nM. de Cussy and the volunteers and negroes from Hispaniola, whom he had\nswindled no less.\n\nThe two parties were fused into one by their common fury, and before the\nexhibition of it the inhabitants of that ill-fated town were stricken\nwith deeper terror than they had yet known since the coming of this\nexpedition.\n\nCaptain Blood alone kept his head, setting a curb upon his deep chagrin.\nHe had promised himself that before parting from M. de Rivarol he would\npresent a reckoning for all the petty affronts and insults to which that\nunspeakable fellow--now proved a scoundrel--had subjected him.\n\n\"We must follow,\" he declared. \"Follow and punish.\"\n\nAt first that was the general cry. Then came the consideration that\nonly two of the buccaneer ships were seaworthy--and these could\nnot accommodate the whole force, particularly being at the moment\nindifferently victualled for a long voyage. The crews of the Lachesis\nand Atropos and with them their captains, Wolverstone and Yberville,\nrenounced the intention. After all, there would be a deal of treasure\nstill hidden in Cartagena. They would remain behind to extort it whilst\nfitting their ships for sea. Let Blood and Hagthorpe and those who\nsailed with them do as they pleased.\n\nThen only did Blood realize the rashness of his proposal, and in\nattempting to draw back he almost precipitated a battle between the two\nparties into which that same proposal had now divided the buccaneers.\nAnd meanwhile those French sails on the horizon were growing less and\nless. Blood was reduced to despair. If he went off now, Heaven knew what\nwould happen to the town, the temper of those whom he was leaving being\nwhat it was. Yet if he remained, it would simply mean that his own\nand Hagthorpe's crews would join in the saturnalia and increase the\nhideousness of events now inevitable. Unable to reach a decision, his\nown men and Hagthorpe's took the matter off his hands, eager to give\nchase to Rivarol. Not only was a dastardly cheat to be punished but\nan enormous treasure to be won by treating as an enemy this French\ncommander who, himself, had so villainously broken the alliance.\n\nWhen Blood, torn as he was between conflicting considerations, still\nhesitated, they bore him almost by main force aboard the Arabella.\n\nWithin an hour, the water-casks at least replenished and stowed aboard,\nthe Arabella and the Elizabeth put to sea upon that angry chase.\n\n\"When we were well at sea, and the Arabella's course was laid,\" writes\nPitt, in his log, \"I went to seek the Captain, knowing him to be in\ngreat trouble of mind over these events. I found him sitting alone\nin his cabin, his head in his hands, torment in the eyes that stared\nstraight before him, seeing nothing.\"\n\n\"What now, Peter?\" cried the young Somerset mariner. \"Lord, man, what is\nthere here to fret you? Surely 't isn't the thought of Rivarol!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Blood thickly. And for once he was communicative. It may well\nbe that he must vent the thing that oppressed him or be driven mad by\nit. And Pitt, after all, was his friend and loved him, and, so, a proper\nman for confidences. \"But if she knew! If she knew! O God! I had thought\nto have done with piracy; thought to have done with it for ever. Yet\nhere have I been committed by this scoundrel to the worst piracy that\never I was guilty of. Think of Cartagena! Think of the hell those devils\nwill be making of it now! And I must have that on my soul!\"\n\n\"Nay, Peter--'t isn't on your soul; but on Rivarol's. It is that dirty\nthief who has brought all this about. What could you have done to\nprevent it?\"\n\n\"I would have stayed if it could have availed.\"\n\n\"It could not, and you know it. So why repine?\"\n\n\"There is more than that to it,\" groaned Blood. \"What now? What remains?\nLoyal service with the English was made impossible for me. Loyal service\nwith France has led to this; and that is equally impossible hereafter.\nWhat to live clean, I believe the only thing is to go and offer my sword\nto the King of Spain.\"\n\nBut something remained--the last thing that he could have\nexpected--something towards which they were rapidly sailing over\nthe tropical, sunlit sea. All this against which he now inveighed so\nbitterly was but a necessary stage in the shaping of his odd destiny.\n\nSetting a course for Hispaniola, since they judged that thither must\nRivarol go to refit before attempting to cross to France, the Arabella\nand the Elizabeth ploughed briskly northward with a moderately\nfavourable wind for two days and nights without ever catching a\nglimpse of their quarry. The third dawn brought with it a haze which\ncircumscribed their range of vision to something between two and three\nmiles, and deepened their growing vexation and their apprehension that\nM. de Rivarol might escape them altogether.\n\nTheir position then--according to Pitt's log--was approximately 75 deg.\n30' W. Long. by 17 deg. 45' N. Lat., so that they had Jamaica on their\nlarboard beam some thirty miles to westward, and, indeed, away to the\nnorthwest, faintly visible as a bank of clouds, appeared the great ridge\nof the Blue Mountains whose peaks were thrust into the clear upper air\nabove the low-lying haze. The wind, to which they were sailing very\nclose, was westerly, and it bore to their ears a booming sound which in\nless experienced ears might have passed for the breaking of surf upon a\nlee shore.\n\n\"Guns!\" said Pitt, who stood with Blood upon the quarter-deck. Blood\nnodded, listening.\n\n\"Ten miles away, perhaps fifteen--somewhere off Port Royal, I should\njudge,\" Pitt added. Then he looked at his captain. \"Does it concern us?\"\nhe asked.\n\n\"Guns off Port Royal... that should argue Colonel Bishop at work. And\nagainst whom should he be in action but against friends of ours I think\nit may concern us. Anyway, we'll stand in to investigate. Bid them put\nthe helm over.\"\n\nClose-hauled they tacked aweather, guided by the sound of combat, which\ngrew in volume and definition as they approached it. Thus for an hour,\nperhaps. Then, as, telescope to his eye, Blood raked the haze, expecting\nat any moment to behold the battling ships, the guns abruptly ceased.\n\nThey held to their course, nevertheless, with all hands on deck,\neagerly, anxiously scanning the sea ahead. And presently an object\nloomed into view, which soon defined itself for a great ship on fire. As\nthe Arabella with the Elizabeth following closely raced nearer on their\nnorth-westerly tack, the outlines of the blazing vessel grew clearer.\nPresently her masts stood out sharp and black above the smoke and\nflames, and through his telescope Blood made out plainly the pennon of\nSt. George fluttering from her maintop.\n\n\"An English ship!\" he cried.\n\nHe scanned the seas for the conqueror in the battle of which this grim\nevidence was added to that of the sounds they had heard, and when\nat last, as they drew closer to the doomed vessel, they made out the\nshadowy outlines of three tall ships, some three or four miles away,\nstanding in toward Port Royal, the first and natural assumption was\nthat these ships must belong to the Jamaica fleet, and that the burning\nvessel was a defeated buccaneer, and because of this they sped on to\npick up the three boats that were standing away from the blazing hulk.\nBut Pitt, who through the telescope was examining the receding squadron,\nobserved things apparent only to the eye of the trained mariner, and\nmade the incredible announcement that the largest of these three vessels\nwas Rivarol's Victorieuse.\n\nThey took in sail and hove to as they came up with the drifting boats,\nladen to capacity with survivors. And there were others adrift on some\nof the spars and wreckage with which the sea was strewn, who must be\nrescued.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX. THE SERVICE OF KING WILLIAM\n\n\nOne of the boats bumped alongside the Arabella, and up the entrance\nladder came first a slight, spruce little gentleman in a coat of\nmulberry satin laced with gold, whose wizened, yellow, rather peevish\nface was framed in a heavy black periwig. His modish and costly apparel\nhad nowise suffered by the adventure through which he had passed, and\nhe carried himself with the easy assurance of a man of rank. Here, quite\nclearly, was no buccaneer. He was closely followed by one who in every\nparticular, save that of age, was his physical opposite, corpulent in\na brawny, vigorous way, with a full, round, weather-beaten face whose\nmouth was humourous and whose eyes were blue and twinkling. He was\nwell dressed without fripperies, and bore with him an air of vigorous\nauthority.\n\nAs the little man stepped from the ladder into the waist, whither\nCaptain Blood had gone to receive him, his sharp, ferrety dark eyes\nswept the uncouth ranks of the assembled crew of the Arabella.\n\n\"And where the devil may I be now?\" he demanded irritably. \"Are you\nEnglish, or what the devil are you?\"\n\n\"Myself, I have the honour to be Irish, sir. My name is Blood--Captain\nPeter Blood, and this is my ship the Arabella, all very much at your\nservice.\n\n\"Blood!\" shrilled the little man. \"O 'Sblood! A pirate!\" He swung to\nthe Colossus who followed him--\"A damned pirate, van der Kuylen. Rend my\nvitals, but we're come from Scylla to Charybdis.\"\n\n\"So?\" said the other gutturally, and again, \"So?\" Then the humour of it\ntook him, and he yielded to it.\n\n\"Damme! What's to laugh at, you porpoise?\" spluttered mulberry-coat. \"A\nfine tale this'll make at home! Admiral van der Kuylen first loses his\nfleet in the night, then has his flagship fired under him by a French\nsquadron, and ends all by being captured by a pirate. I'm glad you find\nit matter for laughter. Since for my sins I happen to be with you, I'm\ndamned if I do.\"\n\n\"There's a misapprehension, if I may make so bold as to point it out,\"\nput in Blood quietly. \"You are not captured, gentlemen; you are rescued.\nWhen you realize it, perhaps it will occur to you to acknowledge the\nhospitality I am offering you. It may be poor, but it is the best at my\ndisposal.\"\n\nThe fierce little gentleman stared at him. \"Damme! Do you permit\nyourself to be ironical?\" he disapproved him, and possibly with a view\nto correcting any such tendency, proceeded to introduce himself. \"I am\nLord Willoughby, King William's Governor-General of the West Indies, and\nthis is Admiral van der Kuylen, commander of His Majesty's West Indian\nfleet, at present mislaid somewhere in this damned Caribbean Sea.\"\n\n\"King William?\" quoth Blood, and he was conscious that Pitt and Dyke,\nwho were behind him, now came edging nearer, sharing his own wonder.\n\"And who may be King William, and of what may he be King?\"\n\n\"What's that?\" In a wonder greater than his own, Lord Willoughby\nstared back at him. At last: \"I am alluding to His Majesty King William\nIII--William of Orange--who, with Queen Mary, has been ruling England\nfor two months and more.\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence, until Blood realized what he was being\ntold.\n\n\"D'ye mean, sir, that they've roused themselves at home, and kicked out\nthat scoundrel James and his gang of ruffians?\"\n\nAdmiral van der Kuylen nudged his lordship, a humourous twinkle in his\nblue eyes.\n\n\"His bolitics are fery sound, I dink,\" he growled.\n\nHis lordship's smile brought lines like gashes into his leathery cheeks.\n\"'Slife! hadn't you heard? Where the devil have you been at all?\"\n\n\"Out of touch with the world for the last three months,\" said Blood.\n\n\"Stab me! You must have been. And in that three months the world has\nundergone some changes.\" Briefly he added an account of them. King\nJames was fled to France, and living under the protection of King Louis,\nwherefore, and for other reasons, England had joined the league against\nher, and was now at war with France. That was how it happened that the\nDutch Admiral's flagship had been attacked by M. de Rivarol's fleet\nthat morning, from which it clearly followed that in his voyage from\nCartagena, the Frenchman must have spoken some ship that gave him the\nnews.\n\nAfter that, with renewed assurances that aboard his ship they should\nbe honourably entreated, Captain Blood led the Governor-General and the\nAdmiral to his cabin, what time the work of rescue went on. The news\nhe had received had set Blood's mind in a turmoil. If King James was\ndethroned and banished, there was an end to his own outlawry for his\nalleged share in an earlier attempt to drive out that tyrant. It became\npossible for him to return home and take up his life again at the point\nwhere it was so unfortunately interrupted four years ago. He was dazzled\nby the prospect so abruptly opened out to him. The thing so filled his\nmind, moved him so deeply, that he must afford it expression. In doing\nso, he revealed of himself more than he knew or intended to the astute\nlittle gentleman who watched him so keenly the while.\n\n\"Go home, if you will,\" said his lordship, when Blood paused. \"You\nmay be sure that none will harass you on the score of your piracy,\nconsidering what it was that drove you to it. But why be in haste? We\nhave heard of you, to be sure, and we know of what you are capable upon\nthe seas. Here is a great chance for you, since you declare yourself\nsick of piracy. Should you choose to serve King William out here during\nthis war, your knowledge of the West Indies should render you a very\nvaluable servant to His Majesty's Government, which you would not find\nungrateful. You should consider it. Damme, sir, I repeat: it is a great\nchance you are given.\n\n\"That your lordship gives me,\" Blood amended, \"I am very grateful. But\nat the moment, I confess, I can consider nothing but this great news. It\nalters the shape of the world. I must accustom myself to view it as it\nnow is, before I can determine my own place in it.\"\n\nPitt came in to report that the work of rescue was at an end, and the\nmen picked up--some forty-five in all--safe aboard the two buccaneer\nships. He asked for orders. Blood rose.\n\n\"I am negligent of your lordship's concerns in my consideration of my\nown. You'll be wishing me to land you at Port Royal.\"\n\n\"At Port Royal?\" The little man squirmed wrathfully on his seat.\nWrathfully and at length he informed Blood that they had put into Port\nRoyal last evening to find its Deputy-Governor absent. \"He had gone on\nsome wild-goose chase to Tortuga after buccaneers, taking the whole of\nthe fleet with him.\"\n\nBlood stared in surprise a moment; then yielded to laughter.\n\n\"He went, I suppose, before news reached him of the change of government\nat home, and the war with France?\"\n\n\"He did not,\" snapped Willoughby. \"He was informed of both, and also of\nmy coming before he set out.\"\n\n\"Oh, impossible!\"\n\n\"So I should have thought. But I have the information from a Major\nMallard whom I found in Port Royal, apparently governing in this fool's\nabsence.\"\n\n\"But is he mad, to leave his post at such a time?\" Blood was amazed.\n\n\"Taking the whole fleet with him, pray remember, and leaving the place\nopen to French attack. That is the sort of Deputy-Governor that the late\nGovernment thought fit to appoint: an epitome of its misrule, damme!\nHe leaves Port Royal unguarded save by a ramshackle fort that can be\nreduced to rubble in an hour. Stab me! It's unbelievable!\"\n\nThe lingering smile faded from Blood's face. \"Is Rivarol aware of this?\"\nhe cried sharply.\n\nIt was the Dutch Admiral who answered him. \"Vould he go dere if he were\nnot? M. de Rivarol he take some of our men prisoners. Berhabs dey dell\nhim. Berhabs he make dem tell. Id is a great obbordunidy.\"\n\nHis lordship snarled like a mountain-cat. \"That rascal Bishop shall\nanswer for it with his head if there's any mischief done through this\ndesertion of his post. What if it were deliberate, eh? What if he is\nmore knave than fool? What if this is his way of serving King James,\nfrom whom he held his office?\"\n\nCaptain Blood was generous. \"Hardly so much. It was just vindictiveness\nthat urged him. It's myself he's hunting at Tortuga, my lord. But, I'm\nthinking that while he's about it, I'd best be looking after Jamaica for\nKing William.\" He laughed, with more mirth than he had used in the last\ntwo months.\n\n\"Set a course for Port Royal, Jeremy, and make all speed. We'll be\nlevel yet with M. de Rivarol, and wipe off some other scores at the same\ntime.\"\n\nBoth Lord Willoughby and the Admiral were on their feet.\n\n\"But you are not equal to it, damme!\" cried his lordship. \"Any one of\nthe Frenchman's three ships is a match for both yours, my man.\"\n\n\"In guns--aye,\" said Blood, and he smiled. \"But there's more than guns\nthat matter in these affairs. If your lordship would like to see\nan action fought at sea as an action should be fought, this is your\nopportunity.\"\n\nBoth stared at him. \"But the odds!\" his lordship insisted.\n\n\"Id is imbossible,\" said van der Kuylen, shaking his great head.\n\"Seamanship is imbordand. Bud guns is guns.\"\n\n\"If I can't defeat him, I can sink my own ships in the channel, and\nblock him in until Bishop gets back from his wild-goose chase with his\nsquadron, or until your own fleet turns up.\"\n\n\"And what good will that be, pray?\" demanded Willoughby.\n\n\"I'll be after telling you. Rivarol is a fool to take this chance,\nconsidering what he's got aboard. He carried in his hold the treasure\nplundered from Cartagena, amounting to forty million livres.\" They\njumped at the mention of that colossal sum. \"He has gone into Port Royal\nwith it. Whether he defeats me or not, he doesn't come out of Port Royal\nwith it again, and sooner or later that treasure shall find its way into\nKing William's coffers, after, say, one fifth share shall have been paid\nto my buccaneers. Is that agreed, Lord Willoughby?\"\n\nHis lordship stood up, and shaking back the cloud of lace from his\nwrist, held out a delicate white hand.\n\n\"Captain Blood, I discover greatness in you,\" said he.\n\n\"Sure it's your lordship has the fine sight to perceive it,\" laughed the\nCaptain.\n\n\"Yes, yes! Bud how vill you do id?\" growled van der Kuylen.\n\n\"Come on deck, and it's a demonstration I'll be giving you before the\nday's much older.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX. THE LAST FIGHT OF THE ARABELLA\n\n\n\"VHY do you vait, my friend?\" growled van der Kuylen.\n\n\"Aye--in God's name!\" snapped Willoughby.\n\nIt was the afternoon of that same day, and the two buccaneer ships\nrocked gently with idly flapping sails under the lee of the long spit\nof land forming the great natural harbour of Port Royal, and less than a\nmile from the straits leading into it, which the fort commanded. It was\ntwo hours and more since they had brought up thereabouts, having crept\nthither unobserved by the city and by M. de Rivarol's ships, and all the\ntime the air had been aquiver with the roar of guns from sea and land,\nannouncing that battle was joined between the French and the defenders\nof Port Royal. That long, inactive waiting was straining the nerves of\nboth Lord Willoughby and van der Kuylen.\n\n\"You said you vould show us zome vine dings. Vhere are dese vine dings?\"\n\nBlood faced them, smiling confidently. He was arrayed for battle, in\nback-and-breast of black steel. \"I'll not be trying your patience much\nlonger. Indeed, I notice already a slackening in the fire. But it's this\nway, now: there's nothing at all to be gained by precipitancy, and a\ndeal to be gained by delaying, as I shall show you, I hope.\"\n\nLord Willoughby eyed him suspiciously. \"Ye think that in the meantime\nBishop may come back or Admiral van der Kuylen's fleet appear?\"\n\n\"Sure, now, I'm thinking nothing of the kind. What I'm thinking is that\nin this engagement with the fort M. de Rivarol, who's a lubberly fellow,\nas I've reason to know, will be taking some damage that may make the\nodds a trifle more even. Sure, it'll be time enough to go forward when\nthe fort has shot its bolt.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye!\" The sharp approval came like a cough from the little\nGovernor-General. \"I perceive your object, and I believe ye're entirely\nright. Ye have the qualities of a great commander, Captain Blood. I beg\nyour pardon for having misunderstood you.\"\n\n\"And that's very handsome of your lordship. Ye see, I have some\nexperience of this kind of action, and whilst I'll take any risk that\nI must, I'll take none that I needn't. But....\" He broke off to\nlisten. \"Aye, I was right. The fire's slackening. It'll mean the end of\nMallard's resistance in the fort. Ho there, Jeremy!\"\n\nHe leaned on the carved rail and issued orders crisply. The bo'sun's\npipe shrilled out, and in a moment the ship that had seemed to slumber\nthere, awoke to life. Came the padding of feet along the decks, the\ncreaking of blocks and the hoisting of sail. The helm was put over\nhard, and in a moment they were moving, the Elizabeth following, ever in\nobedience to the signals from the Arabella, whilst Ogle the gunner,\nwhom he had summoned, was receiving Blood's final instructions before\nplunging down to his station on the main deck.\n\nWithin a quarter of an hour they had rounded the head, and stood in to\nthe harbour mouth, within saker shot of Rivarol's three ships, to which\nthey now abruptly disclosed themselves.\n\nWhere the fort had stood they now beheld a smoking rubbish heap, and the\nvictorious Frenchman with the lily standard trailing from his mastheads\nwas sweeping forward to snatch the rich prize whose defences he had\nshattered.\n\nBlood scanned the French ships, and chuckled. The Victorieuse and the\nMedusa appeared to have taken no more than a few scars; but the third\nship, the Baleine, listing heavily to larboard so as to keep the great\ngash in her starboard well above water, was out of account.\n\n\"You see!\" he cried to van der Kuylen, and without waiting for the\nDutchman's approving grunt, he shouted an order: \"Helm, hard-a-port!\"\n\nThe sight of that great red ship with her gilt beak-head and open\nports swinging broadside on must have given check to Rivarol's soaring\nexultation. Yet before he could move to give an order, before he could\nwell resolve what order to give, a volcano of fire and metal burst\nupon him from the buccaneers, and his decks were swept by the murderous\nscythe of the broadside. The Arabella held to her course, giving place\nto the Elizabeth, which, following closely, executed the same manoeuver.\nAnd then whilst still the Frenchmen were confused, panic-stricken by\nan attack that took them so utterly by surprise, the Arabella had gone\nabout, and was returning in her tracks, presenting now her larboard\nguns, and loosing her second broadside in the wake of the first.\nCame yet another broadside from the Elizabeth and then the Arabella's\ntrumpeter sent a call across the water, which Hagthorpe perfectly\nunderstood.\n\n\"On, now, Jeremy!\" cried Blood. \"Straight into them before they recover\ntheir wits. Stand by, there! Prepare to board! Hayton ... the grapnels!\nAnd pass the word to the gunner in the prow to fire as fast as he can\nload.\"\n\nHe discarded his feathered hat, and covered himself with a steel\nhead-piece, which a negro lad brought him. He meant to lead this\nboarding-party in person. Briskly he explained himself to his\ntwo guests. \"Boarding is our only chance here. We are too heavily\noutgunned.\"\n\nOf this the fullest demonstration followed quickly. The Frenchmen\nhaving recovered their wits at last, both ships swung broadside on, and\nconcentrating upon the Arabella as the nearer and heavier and therefore\nmore immediately dangerous of their two opponents, volleyed upon her\njointly at almost the same moment.\n\nUnlike the buccaneers, who had fired high to cripple their enemies above\ndecks, the French fifed low to smash the hull of their assailant. The\nArabella rocked and staggered under that terrific hammering, although\nPitt kept her headed towards the French so that she should offer the\nnarrowest target. For a moment she seemed to hesitate, then she plunged\nforward again, her beak-head in splinters, her forecastle smashed, and a\ngaping hole forward, that was only just above the water-line. Indeed,\nto make her safe from bilging, Blood ordered a prompt jettisoning of the\nforward guns, anchors, and water-casks and whatever else was moveable.\n\nMeanwhile, the Frenchmen going about, gave the like reception to the\nElizabeth. The Arabella, indifferently served by the wind, pressed\nforward to come to grips. But before she could accomplish her object,\nthe Victorieuse had loaded her starboard guns again, and pounded her\nadvancing enemy with a second broadside at close quarters. Amid the\nthunder of cannon, the rending of timbers, and the screams of maimed\nmen, the half-necked Arabella plunged and reeled into the cloud of smoke\nthat concealed her prey, and then from Hayton went up the cry that she\nwas going down by the head.\n\nBlood's heart stood still. And then in that very moment of his despair,\nthe blue and gold flank of the Victorieuse loomed through the smoke.\nBut even as he caught that enheartening glimpse he perceived, too, how\nsluggish now was their advance, and how with every second it grew more\nsluggish. They must sink before they reached her.\n\nThus, with an oath, opined the Dutch Admiral, and from Lord Willoughby\nthere was a word of blame for Blood's seamanship in having risked all\nupon this gambler's throw of boarding.\n\n\"There was no other chance!\" cried Blood, in broken-hearted frenzy. \"If\nye say it was desperate and foolhardy, why, so it was; but the occasion\nand the means demanded nothing less. I fail within an ace of victory.\"\n\nBut they had not yet completely failed. Hayton himself, and a score of\nsturdy rogues whom his whistle had summoned, were crouching for shelter\namid the wreckage of the forecastle with grapnels ready. Within seven or\neight yards of the Victorieuse, when their way seemed spent, and their\nforward deck already awash under the eyes of the jeering, cheering\nFrenchmen, those men leapt up and forward, and hurled their grapnels\nacross the chasm. Of the four they flung, two reached the Frenchman's\ndecks, and fastened there. Swift as thought itself, was then the action\nof those sturdy, experienced buccaneers. Unhesitatingly all threw\nthemselves upon the chain of one of those grapnels, neglecting the\nother, and heaved upon it with all their might to warp the ships\ntogether. Blood, watching from his own quarter-deck, sent out his voice\nin a clarion call:\n\n\"Musketeers to the prow!\"\n\nThe musketeers, at their station at the waist, obeyed him with the speed\nof men who know that in obedience is the only hope of life. Fifty of\nthem dashed forward instantly, and from the ruins of the forecastle they\nblazed over the heads of Hayton's men, mowing down the French soldiers\nwho, unable to dislodge the irons, firmly held where they had deeply\nbitten into the timbers of the Victorieuse, were themselves preparing to\nfire upon the grapnel crew.\n\nStarboard to starboard the two ships swung against each other with a\njarring thud. By then Blood was down in the waist, judging and acting\nwith the hurricane speed the occasion demanded. Sail had been lowered\nby slashing away the ropes that held the yards. The advance guard of\nboarders, a hundred strong, was ordered to the poop, and his grapnel-men\nwere posted, and prompt to obey his command at the very moment of\nimpact. As a result, the foundering Arabella was literally kept afloat\nby the half-dozen grapnels that in an instant moored her firmly to the\nVictorieuse.\n\nWilloughby and van der Kuylen on the poop had watched in breathless\namazement the speed and precision with which Blood and his desperate\ncrew had gone to work. And now he came racing up, his bugler sounding\nthe charge, the main host of the buccaneers following him, whilst the\nvanguard, led by the gunner Ogle, who had been driven from his guns by\nwater in the gun-deck, leapt shouting to the prow of the Victorieuse, to\nwhose level the high poop of the water-logged Arabella had sunk. Led now\nby Blood himself, they launched themselves upon the French like hounds\nupon the stag they have brought to bay. After them went others, until\nall had gone, and none but Willoughby and the Dutchman were left to\nwatch the fight from the quarter-deck of the abandoned Arabella.\n\nFor fully half-an-hour that battle raged aboard the Frenchman. Beginning\nin the prow, it surged through the forecastle to the waist, where it\nreached a climax of fury. The French resisted stubbornly, and they had\nthe advantage of numbers to encourage them. But for all their stubborn\nvalour, they ended by being pressed back and back across the decks that\nwere dangerously canted to starboard by the pull of the water-logged\nArabella. The buccaneers fought with the desperate fury of men who know\nthat retreat is impossible, for there was no ship to which they could\nretreat, and here they must prevail and make the Victorieuse their own,\nor perish.\n\nAnd their own they made her in the end, and at a cost of nearly half\ntheir numbers. Driven to the quarter-deck, the surviving defenders,\nurged on by the infuriated Rivarol, maintained awhile their desperate\nresistance. But in the end, Rivarol went down with a bullet in his head,\nand the French remnant, numbering scarcely a score of whole men, called\nfor quarter.\n\nEven then the labours of Blood's men were not at an end. The Elizabeth\nand the Medusa were tight-locked, and Hagthorpe's followers were being\ndriven back aboard their own ship for the second time. Prompt measures\nwere demanded. Whilst Pitt and his seamen bore their part with the\nsails, and Ogle went below with a gun-crew, Blood ordered the grapnels\nto be loosed at once. Lord Willoughby and the Admiral were already\naboard the Victorieuse. As they swung off to the rescue of Hagthorpe,\nBlood, from the quarter-deck of the conquered vessel, looked his last\nupon the ship that had served him so well, the ship that had become to\nhim almost as a part of himself. A moment she rocked after her release,\nthen slowly and gradually settled down, the water gurgling and eddying\nabout her topmasts, all that remained visible to mark the spot where she\nhad met her death.\n\nAs he stood there, above the ghastly shambles in the waist of the\nVictorieuse, some one spoke behind him. \"I think, Captain Blood, that it\nis necessary I should beg your pardon for the second time. Never before\nhave I seen the impossible made possible by resource and valour, or\nvictory so gallantly snatched from defeat.\"\n\nHe turned, and presented to Lord Willoughby a formidable front. His\nhead-piece was gone, his breastplate dinted, his right sleeve a rag\nhanging from his shoulder about a naked arm. He was splashed from head\nto foot with blood, and there was blood from a scalp-wound that he had\ntaken matting his hair and mixing with the grime of powder on his face\nto render him unrecognizable.\n\nBut from that horrible mask two vivid eyes looked out preternaturally\nbright, and from those eyes two tears had ploughed each a furrow through\nthe filth of his cheeks.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI. HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR\n\n\nWhen the cost of that victory came to be counted, it was found that of\nthree hundred and twenty buccaneers who had left Cartagena with Captain\nBlood, a bare hundred remained sound and whole. The Elizabeth had\nsuffered so seriously that it was doubtful if she could ever again be\nrendered seaworthy, and Hagthorpe, who had so gallantly commanded her\nin that last action, was dead. Against this, on the other side of the\naccount, stood the facts that, with a far inferior force and by sheer\nskill and desperate valour, Blood's buccaneers had saved Jamaica from\nbombardment and pillage, and they had captured the fleet of M. de\nRivarol, and seized for the benefit of King William the splendid\ntreasure which she carried.\n\nIt was not until the evening of the following day that van der Kuylen's\ntruant fleet of nine ships came to anchor in the harbour of Port Royal,\nand its officers, Dutch and English, were made acquainted with their\nAdmiral's true opinion of their worth.\n\nSix ships of that fleet were instantly refitted for sea. There were\nother West Indian settlements demanding the visit of inspection of the\nnew Governor-General, and Lord Willoughby was in haste to sail for the\nAntilles.\n\n\"And meanwhile,\" he complained to his Admiral, \"I am detained here by\nthe absence of this fool of a Deputy-Governor.\"\n\n\"So?\" said van der Kuylen. \"But vhy should dad dedam you?\"\n\n\"That I may break the dog as he deserves, and appoint his successor\nin some man gifted with a sense of where his duty lies, and with the\nability to perform it.\"\n\n\"Aha! But id is not necessary you remain for dat. And he vill require no\ninsdrucshons, dis one. He vill know how to make Port Royal safe, bedder\nnor you or me.\"\n\n\"You mean Blood?\"\n\n\"Of gourse. Could any man be bedder? You haf seen vhad he can do.\"\n\n\"You think so, too, eh? Egad! I had thought of it; and, rip me, why not?\nHe's a better man than Morgan, and Morgan was made Governor.\"\n\nBlood was sent for. He came, spruce and debonair once more, having\nexploited the resources of Port Royal so to render himself. He was a\ntrifle dazzled by the honour proposed to him, when Lord Willoughby made\nit known. It was so far beyond anything that he had dreamed, and he was\nassailed by doubts of his capacity to undertake so onerous a charge.\n\n\"Damme!\" snapped Willoughby, \"Should I offer it unless I were satisfied\nof your capacity? If that's your only objection....\"\n\n\"It is not, my lord. I had counted upon going home, so I had. I am\nhungry for the green lanes of England.\" He sighed. \"There will be\napple-blossoms in the orchards of Somerset.\"\n\n\"Apple-blossoms!\" His lordship's voice shot up like a rocket, and\ncracked on the word. \"What the devil...? Apple-blossoms!\" He looked at\nvan der Kuylen.\n\nThe Admiral raised his brows and pursed his heavy lips. His eyes\ntwinkled humourously in his great face.\n\n\"So!\" he said. \"Fery boedical!\"\n\nMy lord wheeled fiercely upon Captain Blood. \"You've a past score to\nwipe out, my man!\" he admonished him. \"You've done something towards it,\nI confess; and you've shown your quality in doing it. That's why I offer\nyou the governorship of Jamaica in His Majesty's name--because I account\nyou the fittest man for the office that I have seen.\"\n\nBlood bowed low. \"Your lordship is very good. But....\"\n\n\"Tchah! There's no 'but' to it. If you want your past forgotten, and\nyour future assured, this is your chance. And you are not to treat it\nlightly on account of apple-blossoms or any other damned sentimental\nnonsense. Your duty lies here, at least for as long as the war lasts.\nWhen the war's over, you may get back to Somerset and cider or your\nnative Ireland and its potheen; but until then you'll make the best of\nJamaica and rum.\"\n\nVan der Kuylen exploded into laughter. But from Blood the pleasantry\nelicited no smile. He remained solemn to the point of glumness. His\nthoughts were on Miss Bishop, who was somewhere here in this very house\nin which they stood, but whom he had not seen since his arrival. Had she\nbut shown him some compassion....\n\nAnd then the rasping voice of Willoughby cut in again, upbraiding him\nfor his hesitation, pointing out to him his incredible stupidity in\ntrifling with such a golden opportunity as this. He stiffened and bowed.\n\n\"My lord, you are in the right. I am a fool. But don't be accounting\nme an ingrate as well. If I have hesitated, it is because there are\nconsiderations with which I will not trouble your lordship.\"\n\n\"Apple-blossoms, I suppose?\" sniffed his lordship.\n\nThis time Blood laughed, but there was still a lingering wistfulness in\nhis eyes.\n\n\"It shall be as you wish--and very gratefully, let me assure your\nlordship. I shall know how to earn His Majesty's approbation. You may\ndepend upon my loyal service.\n\n\"If I didn't, I shouldn't offer you this governorship.\"\n\nThus it was settled. Blood's commission was made out and sealed in\nthe presence of Mallard, the Commandant, and the other officers of\nthe garrison, who looked on in round-eyed astonishment, but kept their\nthoughts to themselves.\n\n\"Now ve can aboud our business go,\" said van der Kuylen.\n\n\"We sail to-morrow morning,\" his lordship announced.\n\nBlood was startled.\n\n\"And Colonel Bishop?\" he asked.\n\n\"He becomes your affair. You are now the Governor. You will deal with\nhim as you think proper on his return. Hang him from his own yardarm. He\ndeserves it.\"\n\n\"Isn't the task a trifle invidious?\" wondered Blood.\n\n\"Very well. I'll leave a letter for him. I hope he'll like it.\"\n\nCaptain Blood took up his duties at once. There was much to be done to\nplace Port Royal in a proper state of defence, after what had happened\nthere. He made an inspection of the ruined fort, and issued instructions\nfor the work upon it, which was to be started immediately. Next he\nordered the careening of the three French vessels that they might\nbe rendered seaworthy once more. Finally, with the sanction of Lord\nWilloughby, he marshalled his buccaneers and surrendered to them one\nfifth of the captured treasure, leaving it to their choice thereafter\neither to depart or to enrol themselves in the service of King William.\n\nA score of them elected to remain, and amongst these were Jeremy Pitt,\nOgle, and Dyke, whose outlawry, like Blood's, had come to an end with\nthe downfall of King James. They were--saving old Wolverstone, who\nhad been left behind at Cartagena--the only survivors of that band of\nrebels-convict who had left Barbados over three years ago in the Cinco\nLlagas.\n\nOn the following morning, whilst van der Kuylen's fleet was making\nfinally ready for sea, Blood sat in the spacious whitewashed room that\nwas the Governor's office, when Major Mallard brought him word that\nBishop's homing squadron was in sight.\n\n\"That is very well,\" said Blood. \"I am glad he comes before Lord\nWilloughby's departure. The orders, Major, are that you place him under\narrest the moment he steps ashore. Then bring him here to me. A moment.\"\nHe wrote a hurried note. \"That to Lord Willoughby aboard Admiral van der\nKuylen's flagship.\"\n\nMajor Mallard saluted and departed. Peter Blood sat back in his chair\nand stared at the ceiling, frowning. Time moved on. Came a tap at the\ndoor, and an elderly negro slave presented himself. Would his excellency\nreceive Miss Bishop?\n\nHis excellency changed colour. He sat quite still, staring at the negro\na moment, conscious that his pulses were drumming in a manner wholly\nunusual to them. Then quietly he assented.\n\nHe rose when she entered, and if he was not as pale as she was, it was\nbecause his tan dissembled it. For a moment there was silence between\nthem, as they stood looking each at the other. Then she moved forward,\nand began at last to speak, haltingly, in an unsteady voice, amazing in\none usually so calm and deliberate.\n\n\"I... I... Major Mallard has just told me....\"\n\n\"Major Mallard exceeded his duty,\" said Blood, and because of the effort\nhe made to steady his voice it sounded harsh and unduly loud.\n\nHe saw her start, and stop, and instantly made amends. \"You alarm\nyourself without reason, Miss Bishop. Whatever may lie between me and\nyour uncle, you may be sure that I shall not follow the example he has\nset me. I shall not abuse my position to prosecute a private vengeance.\nOn the contrary, I shall abuse it to protect him. Lord Willoughby's\nrecommendation to me is that I shall treat him without mercy. My own\nintention is to send him back to his plantation in Barbados.\"\n\nShe came slowly forward now. \"I... I am glad that you will do that.\nGlad, above all, for your own sake.\" She held out her hand to him.\n\nHe considered it critically. Then he bowed over it. \"I'll not presume to\ntake it in the hand of a thief and a pirate,\" said he bitterly.\n\n\"You are no longer that,\" she said, and strove to smile.\n\n\"Yet I owe no thanks to you that I am not,\" he answered. \"I think\nthere's no more to be said, unless it be to add the assurance that Lord\nJulian Wade has also nothing to apprehend from me. That, no doubt, will\nbe the assurance that your peace of mind requires?\"\n\n\"For your own sake--yes. But for your own sake only. I would not have\nyou do anything mean or dishonouring.\"\n\n\"Thief and pirate though I be?\"\n\nShe clenched her hand, and made a little gesture of despair and\nimpatience.\n\n\"Will you never forgive me those words?\"\n\n\"I'm finding it a trifle hard, I confess. But what does it matter, when\nall is said?\"\n\nHer clear hazel eyes considered him a moment wistfully. Then she put out\nher hand again.\n\n\"I am going, Captain Blood. Since you are so generous to my uncle,\nI shall be returning to Barbados with him. We are not like to meet\nagain--ever. Is it impossible that we should part friends? Once I\nwronged you, I know. And I have said that I am sorry. Won't you... won't\nyou say 'good-bye'?\"\n\nHe seemed to rouse himself, to shake off a mantle of deliberate\nharshness. He took the hand she proffered. Retaining it, he spoke, his\neyes sombrely, wistfully considering her.\n\n\"You are returning to Barbados?\" he said slowly. \"Will Lord Julian be\ngoing with you?\"\n\n\"Why do you ask me that?\" she confronted him quite fearlessly.\n\n\"Sure, now, didn't he give you my message, or did he bungle it?\"\n\n\"No. He didn't bungle it. He gave it me in your own words. It touched me\nvery deeply. It made me see clearly my error and my injustice. I owe\nit to you that I should say this by way of amend. I judged too harshly\nwhere it was a presumption to judge at all.\"\n\nHe was still holding her hand. \"And Lord Julian, then?\" he asked, his\neyes watching her, bright as sapphires in that copper-coloured face.\n\n\"Lord Julian will no doubt be going home to England. There is nothing\nmore for him to do out here.\"\n\n\"But didn't he ask you to go with him?\"\n\n\"He did. I forgive you the impertinence.\"\n\nA wild hope leapt to life within him.\n\n\"And you? Glory be, ye'll not be telling me ye refused to become my\nlady, when....\"\n\n\"Oh! You are insufferable!\" She tore her hand free and backed away from\nhim. \"I should not have come. Good-bye!\" She was speeding to the door.\n\nHe sprang after her, and caught her. Her face flamed, and her eyes\nstabbed him like daggers. \"These are pirate's ways, I think! Release\nme!\"\n\n\"Arabella!\" he cried on a note of pleading. \"Are ye meaning it? Must I\nrelease ye? Must I let ye go and never set eyes on ye again? Or will ye\nstay and make this exile endurable until we can go home together? Och,\nye're crying now! What have I said to make ye cry, my dear?\"\n\n\"I... I thought you'd never say it,\" she mocked him through her tears.\n\n\"Well, now, ye see there was Lord Julian, a fine figure of a....\"\n\n\"There was never, never anybody but you, Peter.\"\n\nThey had, of course, a deal to say thereafter, so much, indeed, that\nthey sat down to say it, whilst time sped on, and Governor Blood forgot\nthe duties of his office. He had reached home at last. His odyssey was\nended.\n\nAnd meanwhile Colonel Bishop's fleet had come to anchor, and the Colonel\nhad landed on the mole, a disgruntled man to be disgruntled further yet.\nHe was accompanied ashore by Lord Julian Wade.\n\nA corporal's guard was drawn up to receive him, and in advance of\nthis stood Major Mallard and two others who were unknown to the\nDeputy-Governor: one slight and elegant, the other big and brawny.\n\nMajor Mallard advanced. \"Colonel Bishop, I have orders to arrest you.\nYour sword, sir!\"\n\n\"By order of the Governor of Jamaica,\" said the elegant little man\nbehind Major Mallard. Bishop swung to him.\n\n\"The Governor? Ye're mad!\" He looked from one to the other. \"I am the\nGovernor.\"\n\n\"You were,\" said the little man dryly. \"But we've changed that in your\nabsence. You're broke for abandoning your post without due cause, and\nthereby imperiling the settlement over which you had charge. It's a\nserious matter, Colonel Bishop, as you may find. Considering that you\nheld your office from the Government of King James, it is even possible\nthat a charge of treason might lie against you. It rests with your\nsuccessor entirely whether ye're hanged or not.\"\n\nBishop rapped out an oath, and then, shaken by a sudden fear: \"Who the\ndevil may you be?\" he asked.\n\n\"I am Lord Willoughby, Governor General of His Majesty's colonies in the\nWest Indies. You were informed, I think, of my coming.\"\n\nThe remains of Bishop's anger fell from him like a cloak. He broke into\na sweat of fear. Behind him Lord Julian looked on, his handsome face\nsuddenly white and drawn.\n\n\"But, my lord...\" began the Colonel.\n\n\"Sir, I am not concerned to hear your reasons,\" his lordship interrupted\nhim harshly. \"I am on the point of sailing and I have not the time. The\nGovernor will hear you, and no doubt deal justly by you.\" He waved to\nMajor Mallard, and Bishop, a crumpled, broken man, allowed himself to be\nled away.\n\nTo Lord Julian, who went with him, since none deterred him, Bishop\nexpressed himself when presently he had sufficiently recovered.\n\n\"This is one more item to the account of that scoundrel Blood,\" he\nsaid, through his teeth. \"My God, what a reckoning there will be when we\nmeet!\"\n\nMajor Mallard turned away his face that he might conceal his smile, and\nwithout further words led him a prisoner to the Governor's house, the\nhouse that so long had been Colonel Bishop's own residence. He was left\nto wait under guard in the hall, whilst Major Mallard went ahead to\nannounce him.\n\nMiss Bishop was still with Peter Blood when Major Mallard entered. His\nannouncement startled them back to realities.\n\n\"You will be merciful with him. You will spare him all you can for my\nsake, Peter,\" she pleaded.\n\n\"To be sure I will,\" said Blood. \"But I'm afraid the circumstances\nwon't.\"\n\nShe effaced herself, escaping into the garden, and Major Mallard fetched\nthe Colonel.\n\n\"His excellency the Governor will see you now,\" said he, and threw wide\nthe door.\n\nColonel Bishop staggered in, and stood waiting.\n\nAt the table sat a man of whom nothing was visible but the top of a\ncarefully curled black head. Then this head was raised, and a pair of\nblue eyes solemnly regarded the prisoner. Colonel Bishop made a noise\nin his throat, and, paralyzed by amazement, stared into the face of his\nexcellency the Deputy-Governor of Jamaica, which was the face of the man\nhe had been hunting in Tortuga to his present undoing.\n\nThe situation was best expressed to Lord Willoughby by van der Kuylen as\nthe pair stepped aboard the Admiral's flagship.\n\n\"Id is fery boedigal!\" he said, his blue eyes twinkling. \"Cabdain Blood\nis fond of boedry--you remember de abble-blossoms. So? Ha, ha!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Captain Blood, by Rafael Sabatini\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CAPTAIN BLOOD ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1965.txt or 1965.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/9/6/1965/\n\nProduced by An Anonymous Project Gutenberg Volunteer\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
