So far as the geography, the inhabitants, the animals,\nand the features of the countries the travellers pass over are\ndescribed, it is entirely accurate. It gives, in some particulars, a\nsurvey of nearly the whole field of African discovery, and in this\nway will often serve to refresh the memory of the reader. The mode\nof locomotion is, of course, purely imaginary, and the incidents and\nadventures fictitious. The latter are abundantly amusing, and, in view\nof the wonderful \"travellers' tales\" with which we have been entertained\nby African explorers, they can scarcely be considered extravagant; while\nthe ingenuity and invention of the author will be sure to excite the\nsurprise and the admiration of the reader, who will find M. VERNE\nas much at home in voyaging through the air as in journeying \"Twenty\nThousand Leagues under the Seas.\"\n\n\n\n\nDETAILED CONTENTS.\n\n\nCHAP.

The president, Sir Francis M----, made an important\ncommunication to his colleagues, in an address that was frequently\ninterrupted by applause.\n\nThis rare specimen of eloquence terminated with the following sonorous\nphrases bubbling over with patriotism:\n\n\"England has always marched at the head of nations\" (for, the reader\nwill observe, the nations always march at the head of each other), \"by\nthe intrepidity of her explorers in the line of geographical discovery.\"\n(General assent). \"Dr. Samuel Ferguson, one of her most glorious sons,\nwill not reflect discredit on his origin.\" (\"No, indeed!\" from all parts\nof the hall.)\n\n\"This attempt, should it succeed\" (\"It will succeed!\"), \"will complete\nand link together the notions, as yet disjointed, which the world\nentertains of African cartology\" (vehement applause); \"and, should it\nfail, it will, at least, remain on record as one of the most daring\nconceptions of human genius!\" (Tremendous cheering.)\n\n\"Huzza! huzza!\" shouted the immense audience, completely electrified by\nthese inspiring words.\n\n\"Huzza for the intrepid Ferguson!\" cried one of the most excitable of\nthe enthusiastic crowd.\n\nThe wildest cheering resounded on all sides; the name of Ferguson was in\nevery mouth, and we may safely believe that it lost nothing in passing\nthrough English throats. Indeed, the hall fairly shook with it.\n\nAnd there were present, also, those fearless travellers and explorers\nwhose energetic temperaments had borne them through every quarter of the\nglobe, many of them grown old and worn out in the service of science.\nAll had, in some degree, physically or morally, undergone the sorest\ntrials. They had escaped shipwreck; conflagration; Indian tomahawks and\nwar-clubs; the fagot and the stake; nay, even the cannibal maws of the\nSouth Sea Islanders. But still their hearts beat high during Sir Francis\nM----'s address, which certainly was the finest oratorical success that\nthe Royal Geographical Society of London had yet achieved.\n\nBut, in England, enthusiasm does not stop short with mere words. It\nstrikes off money faster than the dies of the Royal Mint itself. So a\nsubscription to encourage Dr. Ferguson was voted there and then, and\nit at once attained the handsome amount of two thousand five hundred\npounds. The sum was made commensurate with the importance of the\nenterprise.\n\nA member of the Society then inquired of the president whether Dr.\nFerguson was not to be officially introduced.\n\n\"The doctor is at the disposition of the meeting,\" replied Sir Francis.\n\n\"Let him come in, then! Bring him in!\" shouted the audience. \"We'd like\nto see a man of such extraordinary daring, face to face!\"\n\n\"Perhaps this incredible proposition of his is only intended to mystify\nus,\" growled an apoplectic old admiral.\n\n\"Suppose that there should turn out to be no such person as Dr.\nFerguson?\" exclaimed another voice, with a malicious twang.\n\n\"Why, then, we'd have to invent one!\" replied a facetious member of this\ngrave Society.\n\n\"Ask Dr. Ferguson to come in,\" was the quiet remark of Sir Francis\nM----.\n\nAnd come in the doctor did, and stood there, quite unmoved by the\nthunders of applause that greeted his appearance.\n\nHe was a man of about forty years of age, of medium height and physique.\nHis sanguine temperament was disclosed in the deep color of his cheeks.\nHis countenance was coldly expressive, with regular features, and a\nlarge nose--one of those noses that resemble the prow of a ship, and\nstamp the faces of men predestined to accomplish great discoveries.\nHis eyes, which were gentle and intelligent, rather than bold, lent a\npeculiar charm to his physiognomy. His arms were long, and his feet were\nplanted with that solidity which indicates a great pedestrian.\n\nA calm gravity seemed to surround the doctor's entire person, and no one\nwould dream that he could become the agent of any mystification, however\nharmless.\n\nHence, the applause that greeted him at the outset continued until he,\nwith a friendly gesture, claimed silence on his own behalf. He stepped\ntoward the seat that had been prepared for him on his presentation,\nand then, standing erect and motionless, he, with a determined glance,\npointed his right forefinger upward, and pronounced aloud the single\nword--\n\n\"Excelsior!\"\n\nNever had one of Bright's or Cobden's sudden onslaughts, never had\none of Palmerston's abrupt demands for funds to plate the rocks of the\nEnglish coast with iron, made such a sensation. Sir Francis M----'s\naddress was completely overshadowed. The doctor had shown himself\nmoderate, sublime, and self-contained, in one; he had uttered the word\nof the situation--\n\n\"Excelsior!\"\n\nThe gouty old admiral who had been finding fault, was completely won\nover by the singular man before him, and immediately moved the insertion\nof Dr. Ferguson's speech in \"The Proceedings of the Royal Geographical\nSociety of London.\"\n\nWho, then, was this person, and what was the enterprise that he\nproposed?\n\nFerguson's father, a brave and worthy captain in the English Navy, had\nassociated his son with him, from the young man's earliest years, in\nthe perils and adventures of his profession. The fine little fellow, who\nseemed to have never known the meaning of fear, early revealed a keen\nand active mind, an investigating intelligence, and a remarkable\nturn for scientific study; moreover, he disclosed uncommon address in\nextricating himself from difficulty; he was never perplexed, not even\nin handling his fork for the first time--an exercise in which children\ngenerally have so little success.\n\nHis fancy kindled early at the recitals he read of daring enterprise and\nmaritime adventure, and he followed with enthusiasm the discoveries that\nsignalized the first part of the nineteenth century. He mused over the\nglory of the Mungo Parks, the Bruces, the Caillies, the Levaillants, and\nto some extent, I verily believe, of Selkirk (Robinson Crusoe), whom\nhe considered in no wise inferior to the rest. How many a well-employed\nhour he passed with that hero on his isle of Juan Fernandez! Often he\ncriticised the ideas of the shipwrecked sailor, and sometimes discussed\nhis plans and projects. He would have done differently, in such and such\na case, or quite as well at least--of that he felt assured. But of one\nthing he was satisfied, that he never should have left that pleasant\nisland, where he was as happy as a king without subjects--no, not if\nthe inducement held out had been promotion to the first lordship in the\nadmiralty!\n\nIt may readily be conjectured whether these tendencies were developed\nduring a youth of adventure, spent in every nook and corner of the\nGlobe. Moreover, his father, who was a man of thorough instruction,\nomitted no opportunity to consolidate this keen intelligence by serious\nstudies in hydrography, physics, and mechanics, along with a slight\ntincture of botany, medicine, and astronomy.\n\nUpon the death of the estimable captain, Samuel Ferguson, then\ntwenty-two years of age, had already made his voyage around the world.\nHe had enlisted in the Bengalese Corps of Engineers, and distinguished\nhimself in several affairs; but this soldier's life had not exactly\nsuited him; caring but little for command, he had not been fond of\nobeying. He, therefore, sent in his resignation, and half botanizing,\nhalf playing the hunter, he made his way toward the north of the Indian\nPeninsula, and crossed it from Calcutta to Surat--a mere amateur trip\nfor him.\n\nFrom Surat we see him going over to Australia, and in 1845 participating\nin Captain Sturt's expedition, which had been sent out to explore the\nnew Caspian Sea, supposed to exist in the centre of New Holland.\n\nSamuel Ferguson returned to England about 1850, and, more than ever\npossessed by the demon of discovery, he spent the intervening time,\nuntil 1853, in accompanying Captain McClure on the expedition that went\naround the American Continent from Behring's Straits to Cape Farewell.\n\nNotwithstanding fatigues of every description, and in all climates,\nFerguson's constitution continued marvellously sound. He felt at ease in\nthe midst of the most complete privations; in fine, he was the very\ntype of the thoroughly accomplished explorer whose stomach expands or\ncontracts at will; whose limbs grow longer or shorter according to\nthe resting-place that each stage of a journey may bring; who can fall\nasleep at any hour of the day or awake at any hour of the night.\n\nNothing, then, was less surprising, after that, than to find our\ntraveller, in the period from 1855 to 1857, visiting the whole region\nwest of the Thibet, in company with the brothers Schlagintweit,\nand bringing back some curious ethnographic observations from that\nexpedition.\n\nDuring these different journeys, Ferguson had been the most active and\ninteresting correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, the penny newspaper\nwhose circulation amounts to 140,000 copies, and yet scarcely suffices\nfor its many legions of readers. Thus, the doctor had become well known\nto the public, although he could not claim membership in either of the\nRoyal Geographical Societies of London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, or\nSt. Petersburg, or yet with the Travellers' Club, or even the Royal\nPolytechnic Institute, where his friend the statistician Cockburn ruled\nin state.\n\nThe latter savant had, one day, gone so far as to propose to him the\nfollowing problem: Given the number of miles travelled by the doctor in\nmaking the circuit of the Globe, how many more had his head described\nthan his feet, by reason of the different lengths of the radii?--or,\nthe number of miles traversed by the doctor's head and feet respectively\nbeing given, required the exact height of that gentleman?\n\nThis was done with the idea of complimenting him, but the doctor had\nheld himself aloof from all the learned bodies--belonging, as he did, to\nthe church militant and not to the church polemical. He found his time\nbetter employed in seeking than in discussing, in discovering rather\nthan discoursing.\n\nThere is a story told of an Englishman who came one day to Geneva,\nintending to visit the lake. He was placed in one of those odd vehicles\nin which the passengers sit side by side, as they do in an omnibus.\nWell, it so happened that the Englishman got a seat that left him with\nhis back turned toward the lake. The vehicle completed its circular trip\nwithout his thinking to turn around once, and he went back to London\ndelighted with the Lake of Geneva.\n\nDoctor Ferguson, however, had turned around to look about him on his\njourneyings, and turned to such good purpose that he had seen a great\ndeal. In doing so, he had simply obeyed the laws of his nature, and we\nhave good reason to believe that he was, to some extent, a fatalist,\nbut of an orthodox school of fatalism withal, that led him to rely\nupon himself and even upon Providence. He claimed that he was impelled,\nrather than drawn by his own volition, to journey as he did, and that he\ntraversed the world like the locomotive, which does not direct itself,\nbut is guided and directed by the track it runs on.\n\n\"I do not follow my route;\" he often said, \"it is my route that follows\nme.\"\n\nThe reader will not be surprised, then, at the calmness with which the\ndoctor received the applause that welcomed him in the Royal Society. He\nwas above all such trifles, having no pride, and less vanity. He\nlooked upon the proposition addressed to him by Sir Francis M----as the\nsimplest thing in the world, and scarcely noticed the immense effect\nthat it produced.\n\nWhen the session closed, the doctor was escorted to the rooms of the\nTravellers' Club, in Pall Mall. A superb entertainment had been prepared\nthere in his honor. The dimensions of the dishes served were made to\ncorrespond with the importance of the personage entertained, and the\nboiled sturgeon that figured at this magnificent repast was not an inch\nshorter than Dr. Ferguson himself.\n\nNumerous toasts were offered and quaffed, in the wines of France, to\nthe celebrated travellers who had made their names illustrious by their\nexplorations of African territory. The guests drank to their health or\nto their memory, in alphabetical order, a good old English way of doing\nthe thing. Among those remembered thus, were: Abbadie, Adams, Adamson,\nAnderson, Arnaud, Baikie, Baldwin, Barth, Batouda, Beke, Beltram, Du\nBerba, Bimbachi, Bolognesi, Bolwik, Belzoni, Bonnemain, Brisson, Browne,\nBruce, Brun-Rollet, Burchell, Burckhardt, Burton, Cailland, Caillie,\nCampbell, Chapman, Clapperton, Clot-Bey, Colomieu, Courval, Cumming,\nCuny, Debono, Decken, Denham, Desavanchers, Dicksen, Dickson, Dochard,\nDu Chaillu, Duncan, Durand, Duroule, Duveyrier, D'Escayrac, De Lauture,\nErhardt, Ferret, Fresnel, Galinier, Galton, Geoffroy, Golberry,\nHahn, Halm, Harnier, Hecquart, Heuglin, Hornemann, Houghton, Imbert,\nKauffmann, Knoblecher, Krapf, Kummer, Lafargue, Laing, Lafaille,\nLambert, Lamiral, Lampriere, John Lander, Richard Lander, Lefebvre,\nLejean, Levaillant, Livingstone, MacCarthy, Maggiar, Maizan, Malzac,\nMoffat, Mollien, Monteiro, Morrison, Mungo Park, Neimans, Overweg,\nPanet, Partarrieau, Pascal, Pearse, Peddie, Penney, Petherick, Poncet,\nPrax, Raffenel, Rabh, Rebmann, Richardson, Riley, Ritchey, Rochet\nd'Hericourt, Rongawi, Roscher, Ruppel, Saugnier, Speke, Steidner,\nThibaud, Thompson, Thornton, Toole, Tousny, Trotter, Tuckey, Tyrwhitt,\nVaudey, Veyssiere, Vincent, Vinco, Vogel, Wahlberg, Warrington,\nWashington, Werne, Wild, and last, but not least, Dr. Ferguson, who,\nby his incredible attempt, was to link together the achievements of all\nthese explorers, and complete the series of African discovery.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SECOND.\n\nThe Article in the Daily Telegraph.--War between the Scientific\nJournals.--Mr. Petermann backs his Friend Dr. Ferguson.--Reply of the\nSavant Koner.--Bets made.--Sundry Propositions offered to the Doctor.\n\nOn the next day, in its number of January 15th, the Daily Telegraph\npublished an article couched in the following terms:\n\n\"Africa is, at length, about to surrender the secret of her vast\nsolitudes; a modern OEdipus is to give us the key to that enigma which\nthe learned men of sixty centuries have not been able to decipher. In\nother days, to seek the sources of the Nile--fontes Nili quoerere--was\nregarded as a mad endeavor, a chimera that could not be realized.\n\n\"Dr. Barth, in following out to Soudan the track traced by Denham and\nClapperton; Dr. Livingstone, in multiplying his fearless explorations\nfrom the Cape of Good Hope to the basin of the Zambesi; Captains Burton\nand Speke, in the discovery of the great interior lakes, have opened\nthree highways to modern civilization. THEIR POINT OF INTERSECTION,\nwhich no traveller has yet been able to reach, is the very heart of\nAfrica, and it is thither that all efforts should now be directed.\n\n\"The labors of these hardy pioneers of science are now about to be\nknit together by the daring project of Dr. Samuel Ferguson, whose\nfine explorations our readers have frequently had the opportunity of\nappreciating.\n\n\"This intrepid discoverer proposes to traverse all Africa from east to\nwest IN A BALLOON. If we are well informed, the point of departure\nfor this surprising journey is to be the island of Zanzibar, upon\nthe eastern coast. As for the point of arrival, it is reserved for\nProvidence alone to designate.\n\n\"The proposal for this scientific undertaking was officially made,\nyesterday, at the rooms of the Royal Geographical Society, and the sum\nof twenty-five hundred pounds was voted to defray the expenses of the\nenterprise.\n\n\"We shall keep our readers informed as to the progress of this\nenterprise, which has no precedent in the annals of exploration.\"\n\nAs may be supposed, the foregoing article had an enormous echo among\nscientific people. At first, it stirred up a storm of incredulity; Dr.\nFerguson passed for a purely chimerical personage of the Barnum stamp,\nwho, after having gone through the United States, proposed to \"do\" the\nBritish Isles.\n\nA humorous reply appeared in the February number of the Bulletins de la\nSociete Geographique of Geneva, which very wittily showed up the Royal\nSociety of London and their phenomenal sturgeon.\n\nBut Herr Petermann, in his Mittheilungen, published at Gotha, reduced\nthe Geneva journal to the most absolute silence. Herr Petermann knew\nDr. Ferguson personally, and guaranteed the intrepidity of his dauntless\nfriend.\n\nBesides, all manner of doubt was quickly put out of the question:\npreparations for the trip were set on foot at London; the factories of\nLyons received a heavy order for the silk required for the body of the\nballoon; and, finally, the British Government placed the transport-ship\nResolute, Captain Bennett, at the disposal of the expedition.\n\nAt once, upon word of all this, a thousand encouragements were offered,\nand felicitations came pouring in from all quarters. The details of the\nundertaking were published in full in the bulletins of the Geographical\nSociety of Paris; a remarkable article appeared in the Nouvelles Annales\ndes Voyages, de la Geographie, de l'Histoire, et de l'Archaeologie de\nM. V. A. Malte-Brun (\"New Annals of Travels, Geography, History, and\nArchaeology, by M. V. A. Malte-Brun\"); and a searching essay in the\nZeitschrift fur Allgemeine Erdkunde, by Dr. W. Koner, triumphantly\ndemonstrated the feasibility of the journey, its chances of success, the\nnature of the obstacles existing, the immense advantages of the aerial\nmode of locomotion, and found fault with nothing but the selected point\nof departure, which it contended should be Massowah, a small port in\nAbyssinia, whence James Bruce, in 1768, started upon his explorations\nin search of the sources of the Nile. Apart from that, it mentioned, in\nterms of unreserved admiration, the energetic character of Dr. Ferguson,\nand the heart, thrice panoplied in bronze, that could conceive and\nundertake such an enterprise.\n\nThe North American Review could not, without some displeasure,\ncontemplate so much glory monopolized by England. It therefore rather\nridiculed the doctor's scheme, and urged him, by all means, to push his\nexplorations as far as America, while he was about it.\n\nIn a word, without going over all the journals in the world, there was\nnot a scientific publication, from the Journal of Evangelical Missions\nto the Revue Algerienne et Coloniale, from the Annales de la Propagation\nde la Foi to the Church Missionary Intelligencer, that had not something\nto say about the affair in all its phases.\n\nMany large bets were made at London and throughout England generally,\nfirst, as to the real or supposititious existence of Dr. Ferguson;\nsecondly, as to the trip itself, which, some contended, would not be\nundertaken at all, and which was really contemplated, according to\nothers; thirdly, upon the success or failure of the enterprise;\nand fourthly, upon the probabilities of Dr. Ferguson's return. The\nbetting-books were covered with entries of immense sums, as though the\nEpsom races were at stake.\n\nThus, believers and unbelievers, the learned and the ignorant, alike\nhad their eyes fixed on the doctor, and he became the lion of the day,\nwithout knowing that he carried such a mane. On his part, he willingly\ngave the most accurate information touching his project. He was very\neasily approached, being naturally the most affable man in the world.\nMore than one bold adventurer presented himself, offering to share the\ndangers as well as the glory of the undertaking; but he refused them\nall, without giving his reasons for rejecting them.\n\nNumerous inventors of mechanism applicable to the guidance of balloons\ncame to propose their systems, but he would accept none; and, when\nhe was asked whether he had discovered something of his own for that\npurpose, he constantly refused to give any explanation, and merely\nbusied himself more actively than ever with the preparations for his\njourney.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRD.\n\nThe Doctor's Friend.--The Origin of their Friendship.--Dick Kennedy at\nLondon.--An unexpected but not very consoling Proposal.--A Proverb by\nno means cheering.--A few Names from the African Martyrology.--The\nAdvantages of a Balloon.--Dr. Ferguson's Secret.\n\nDr. Ferguson had a friend--not another self, indeed, an alter ego, for\nfriendship could not exist between two beings exactly alike.\n\nBut, if they possessed different qualities, aptitudes, and temperaments,\nDick Kennedy and Samuel Ferguson lived with one and the same heart, and\nthat gave them no great trouble. In fact, quite the reverse.\n\nDick Kennedy was a Scotchman, in the full acceptation of the word--open,\nresolute, and headstrong. He lived in the town of Leith, which is near\nEdinburgh, and, in truth, is a mere suburb of Auld Reekie. Sometimes he\nwas a fisherman, but he was always and everywhere a determined hunter,\nand that was nothing remarkable for a son of Caledonia, who had known\nsome little climbing among the Highland mountains. He was cited as a\nwonderful shot with the rifle, since not only could he split a bullet\non a knife-blade, but he could divide it into two such equal parts that,\nupon weighing them, scarcely any difference would be perceptible.\n\nKennedy's countenance strikingly recalled that of Herbert Glendinning,\nas Sir Walter Scott has depicted it in \"The Monastery\"; his stature was\nabove six feet; full of grace and easy movement, he yet seemed gifted\nwith herculean strength; a face embrowned by the sun; eyes keen and\nblack; a natural air of daring courage; in fine, something sound, solid,\nand reliable in his entire person, spoke, at first glance, in favor of\nthe bonny Scot.\n\nThe acquaintanceship of these two friends had been formed in India, when\nthey belonged to the same regiment. While Dick would be out in pursuit\nof the tiger and the elephant, Samuel would be in search of plants and\ninsects. Each could call himself expert in his own province, and more\nthan one rare botanical specimen, that to science was as great a victory\nwon as the conquest of a pair of ivory tusks, became the doctor's booty.\n\nThese two young men, moreover, never had occasion to save each other's\nlives, or to render any reciprocal service. Hence, an unalterable\nfriendship. Destiny sometimes bore them apart, but sympathy always\nunited them again.\n\nSince their return to England they had been frequently separated by\nthe doctor's distant expeditions; but, on his return, the latter never\nfailed to go, not to ASK for hospitality, but to bestow some weeks of\nhis presence at the home of his crony Dick.\n\nThe Scot talked of the past; the doctor busily prepared for the future.\nThe one looked back, the other forward. Hence, a restless spirit\npersonified in Ferguson; perfect calmness typified in Kennedy--such was\nthe contrast.\n\nAfter his journey to the Thibet, the doctor had remained nearly two\nyears without hinting at new explorations; and Dick, supposing that his\nfriend's instinct for travel and thirst for adventure had at length died\nout, was perfectly enchanted. They would have ended badly, some day or\nother, he thought to himself; no matter what experience one has with\nmen, one does not travel always with impunity among cannibals and wild\nbeasts. So, Kennedy besought the doctor to tie up his bark for life,\nhaving done enough for science, and too much for the gratitude of men.\n\nThe doctor contented himself with making no reply to this. He\nremained absorbed in his own reflections, giving himself up to secret\ncalculations, passing his nights among heaps of figures, and making\nexperiments with the strangest-looking machinery, inexplicable to\neverybody but himself. It could readily be guessed, though, that some\ngreat thought was fermenting in his brain.\n\n\"What can he have been planning?\" wondered Kennedy, when, in the month\nof January, his friend quitted him to return to London.\n\nHe found out one morning when he looked into the Daily Telegraph.\n\n\"Merciful Heaven!\" he exclaimed, \"the lunatic! the madman! Cross Africa\nin a balloon! Nothing but that was wanted to cap the climax! That's what\nhe's been bothering his wits about these two years past!\"\n\nNow, reader, substitute for all these exclamation points, as many\nringing thumps with a brawny fist upon the table, and you have some idea\nof the manual exercise that Dick went through while he thus spoke.\n\nWhen his confidential maid-of-all-work, the aged Elspeth, tried to\ninsinuate that the whole thing might be a hoax--\n\n\"Not a bit of it!\" said he. \"Don't I know my man? Isn't it just like\nhim? Travel through the air! There, now, he's jealous of the eagles,\nnext! No! I warrant you, he'll not do it! I'll find a way to stop him!\nHe! why if they'd let him alone, he'd start some day for the moon!\"\n\nOn that very evening Kennedy, half alarmed, and half exasperated, took\nthe train for London, where he arrived next morning.\n\nThree-quarters of an hour later a cab deposited him at the door of the\ndoctor's modest dwelling, in Soho Square, Greek Street. Forthwith he\nbounded up the steps and announced his arrival with five good, hearty,\nsounding raps at the door.\n\nFerguson opened, in person.\n\n\"Dick! you here?\" he exclaimed, but with no great expression of\nsurprise, after all.\n\n\"Dick himself!\" was the response.\n\n\"What, my dear boy, you at London, and this the mid-season of the winter\nshooting?\"\n\n\"Yes! here I am, at London!\"\n\n\"And what have you come to town for?\"\n\n\"To prevent the greatest piece of folly that ever was conceived.\"\n\n\"Folly!\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Is what this paper says, the truth?\" rejoined Kennedy, holding out the\ncopy of the Daily Telegraph, mentioned above.\n\n\"Ah! that's what you mean, is it? These newspapers are great tattlers!\nBut, sit down, my dear Dick.\"\n\n\"No, I won't sit down!--Then, you really intend to attempt this\njourney?\"\n\n\"Most certainly! all my preparations are getting along finely, and I--\"\n\n\"Where are your traps? Let me have a chance at them! I'll make them fly!\nI'll put your preparations in fine order.\" And so saying, the gallant\nScot gave way to a genuine explosion of wrath.\n\n\"Come, be calm, my dear Dick!\" resumed the doctor. \"You're angry at me\nbecause I did not acquaint you with my new project.\"\n\n\"He calls this his new project!\"\n\n\"I have been very busy,\" the doctor went on, without heeding the\ninterruption; \"I have had so much to look after! But rest assured that I\nshould not have started without writing to you.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed! I'm highly honored.\"\n\n\"Because it is my intention to take you with me.\"\n\nUpon this, the Scotchman gave a leap that a wild goat would not have\nbeen ashamed of among his native crags.\n\n\"Ah! really, then, you want them to send us both to Bedlam!\"\n\n\"I have counted positively upon you, my dear Dick, and I have picked you\nout from all the rest.\"\n\nKennedy stood speechless with amazement.\n\n\"After listening to me for ten minutes,\" said the doctor, \"you will\nthank me!\"\n\n\"Are you speaking seriously?\"\n\n\"Very seriously.\"\n\n\"And suppose that I refuse to go with you?\"\n\n\"But you won't refuse.\"\n\n\"But, suppose that I were to refuse?\"\n\n\"Well, I'd go alone.\"\n\n\"Let us sit down,\" said Kennedy, \"and talk without excitement. The\nmoment you give up jesting about it, we can discuss the thing.\"\n\n\"Let us discuss it, then, at breakfast, if you have no objections, my\ndear Dick.\"\n\nThe two friends took their seats opposite to each other, at a little\ntable with a plate of toast and a huge tea-urn before them.\n\n\"My dear Samuel,\" said the sportsman, \"your project is insane! it\nis impossible! it has no resemblance to anything reasonable or\npracticable!\"\n\n\"That's for us to find out when we shall have tried it!\"\n\n\"But trying it is exactly what you ought not to attempt.\"\n\n\"Why so, if you please?\"\n\n\"Well, the risks, the difficulty of the thing.\"\n\n\"As for difficulties,\" replied Ferguson, in a serious tone, \"they were\nmade to be overcome; as for risks and dangers, who can flatter himself\nthat he is to escape them? Every thing in life involves danger; it may\neven be dangerous to sit down at one's own table, or to put one's hat on\none's own head. Moreover, we must look upon what is to occur as having\nalready occurred, and see nothing but the present in the future, for the\nfuture is but the present a little farther on.\"\n\n\"There it is!\" exclaimed Kennedy, with a shrug. \"As great a fatalist as\never!\"\n\n\"Yes! but in the good sense of the word. Let us not trouble ourselves,\nthen, about what fate has in store for us, and let us not forget our\ngood old English proverb: 'The man who was born to be hung will never be\ndrowned!'\"\n\nThere was no reply to make, but that did not prevent Kennedy from\nresuming a series of arguments which may be readily conjectured, but\nwhich were too long for us to repeat.\n\n\"Well, then,\" he said, after an hour's discussion, \"if you are\nabsolutely determined to make this trip across the African continent--if\nit is necessary for your happiness, why not pursue the ordinary routes?\"\n\n\"Why?\" ejaculated the doctor, growing animated. \"Because, all attempts\nto do so, up to this time, have utterly failed. Because, from Mungo\nPark, assassinated on the Niger, to Vogel, who disappeared in the\nWadai country; from Oudney, who died at Murmur, and Clapperton, lost\nat Sackatou, to the Frenchman Maizan, who was cut to pieces; from Major\nLaing, killed by the Touaregs, to Roscher, from Hamburg, massacred\nin the beginning of 1860, the names of victim after victim have been\ninscribed on the lists of African martyrdom! Because, to contend\nsuccessfully against the elements; against hunger, and thirst, and\nfever; against savage beasts, and still more savage men, is impossible!\nBecause, what cannot be done in one way, should be tried in another. In\nfine, because what one cannot pass through directly in the middle, must\nbe passed by going to one side or overhead!\"\n\n\"If passing over it were the only question!\" interposed Kennedy; \"but\npassing high up in the air, doctor, there's the rub!\"\n\n\"Come, then,\" said the doctor, \"what have I to fear? You will admit\nthat I have taken my precautions in such manner as to be certain that\nmy balloon will not fall; but, should it disappoint me, I should\nfind myself on the ground in the normal conditions imposed upon other\nexplorers. But, my balloon will not deceive me, and we need make no such\ncalculations.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you must take them into view.\"\n\n\"No, Dick. I intend not to be separated from the balloon until I reach\nthe western coast of Africa. With it, every thing is possible; without\nit, I fall back into the dangers and difficulties as well as the natural\nobstacles that ordinarily attend such an expedition: with it, neither\nheat, nor torrents, nor tempests, nor the simoom, nor unhealthy\nclimates, nor wild animals, nor savage men, are to be feared! If I feel\ntoo hot, I can ascend; if too cold, I can come down. Should there be\na mountain, I can pass over it; a precipice, I can sweep across it;\na river, I can sail beyond it; a storm, I can rise away above it; a\ntorrent, I can skim it like a bird! I can advance without fatigue, I can\nhalt without need of repose! I can soar above the nascent cities! I can\nspeed onward with the rapidity of a tornado, sometimes at the loftiest\nheights, sometimes only a hundred feet above the soil, while the map of\nAfrica unrolls itself beneath my gaze in the great atlas of the world.\"\n\nEven the stubborn Kennedy began to feel moved, and yet the spectacle\nthus conjured up before him gave him the vertigo. He riveted his eyes\nupon the doctor with wonder and admiration, and yet with fear, for he\nalready felt himself swinging aloft in space.\n\n\"Come, come,\" said he, at last. \"Let us see, Samuel. Then you have\ndiscovered the means of guiding a balloon?\"\n\n\"Not by any means. That is a Utopian idea.\"\n\n\"Then, you will go--\"\n\n\"Whithersoever Providence wills; but, at all events, from east to west.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because I expect to avail myself of the trade-winds, the direction of\nwhich is always the same.\"\n\n\"Ah! yes, indeed!\" said Kennedy, reflecting; \"the\ntrade-winds--yes--truly--one might--there's something in that!\"\n\n\"Something in it--yes, my excellent friend--there's EVERY THING in it.\nThe English Government has placed a transport at my disposal, and three\nor four vessels are to cruise off the western coast of Africa, about the\npresumed period of my arrival. In three months, at most, I shall be at\nZanzibar, where I will inflate my balloon, and from that point we shall\nlaunch ourselves.\"\n\n\"We!\" said Dick.\n\n\"Have you still a shadow of an objection to offer? Speak, friend\nKennedy.\"\n\n\"An objection! I have a thousand; but among other things, tell me, if\nyou expect to see the country. If you expect to mount and descend at\npleasure, you cannot do so, without losing your gas. Up to this time no\nother means have been devised, and it is this that has always prevented\nlong journeys in the air.\"\n\n\"My dear Dick, I have only one word to answer--I shall not lose one\nparticle of gas.\"\n\n\"And yet you can descend when you please?\"\n\n\"I shall descend when I please.\"\n\n\"And how will you do that?\"\n\n\"Ah, ha! therein lies my secret, friend Dick. Have faith, and let my\ndevice be yours--'Excelsior!'\"\n\n\"'Excelsior' be it then,\" said the sportsman, who did not understand a\nword of Latin.\n\nBut he made up his mind to oppose his friend's departure by all means in\nhis power, and so pretended to give in, at the same time keeping on the\nwatch. As for the doctor, he went on diligently with his preparations.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOURTH.\n\nAfrican Explorations.--Barth, Richardson, Overweg, Werne, Brun-Rollet,\nPenney, Andrea, Debono, Miani, Guillaume Lejean, Bruce, Krapf and\nRebmann, Maizan, Roscher, Burton and Speke.\n\nThe aerial line which Dr. Ferguson counted upon following had not been\nchosen at random; his point of departure had been carefully studied,\nand it was not without good cause that he had resolved to ascend at\nthe island of Zanzibar. This island, lying near to the eastern coast of\nAfrica, is in the sixth degree of south latitude, that is to say, four\nhundred and thirty geographical miles below the equator.\n\nFrom this island the latest expedition, sent by way of the great lakes\nto explore the sources of the Nile, had just set out.\n\nBut it would be well to indicate what explorations Dr. Ferguson hoped to\nlink together. The two principal ones were those of Dr. Barth in 1849,\nand of Lieutenants Burton and Speke in 1858.\n\nDr. Barth is a Hamburger, who obtained permission for himself and\nfor his countryman Overweg to join the expedition of the Englishman\nRichardson. The latter was charged with a mission in the Soudan.\n\nThis vast region is situated between the fifteenth and tenth degrees\nof north latitude; that is to say, that, in order to approach it, the\nexplorer must penetrate fifteen hundred miles into the interior of\nAfrica.\n\nUntil then, the country in question had been known only through the\njourneys of Denham, of Clapperton, and of Oudney, made from 1822 to\n1824. Richardson, Barth, and Overweg, jealously anxious to push their\ninvestigations farther, arrived at Tunis and Tripoli, like their\npredecessors, and got as far as Mourzouk, the capital of Fezzan.\n\nThey then abandoned the perpendicular line, and made a sharp turn\nwestward toward Ghat, guided, with difficulty, by the Touaregs. After\na thousand scenes of pillage, of vexation, and attacks by armed forces,\ntheir caravan arrived, in October, at the vast oasis of Asben. Dr. Barth\nseparated from his companions, made an excursion to the town of Aghades,\nand rejoined the expedition, which resumed its march on the 12th of\nDecember. At length it reached the province of Damerghou; there the\nthree travellers parted, and Barth took the road to Kano, where he\narrived by dint of perseverance, and after paying considerable tribute.\n\nIn spite of an intense fever, he quitted that place on the 7th of March,\naccompanied by a single servant. The principal aim of his journey was to\nreconnoitre Lake Tchad, from which he was still three hundred and fifty\nmiles distant. He therefore advanced toward the east, and reached the\ntown of Zouricolo, in the Bornou country, which is the core of the great\ncentral empire of Africa. There he heard of the death of Richardson, who\nhad succumbed to fatigue and privation. He next arrived at Kouka, the\ncapital of Bornou, on the borders of the lake. Finally, at the end of\nthree weeks, on the 14th of April, twelve months after having quitted\nTripoli, he reached the town of Ngornou.\n\nWe find him again setting forth on the 29th of March, 1851, with\nOverweg, to visit the kingdom of Adamaoua, to the south of the lake, and\nfrom there he pushed on as far as the town of Yola, a little below nine\ndegrees north latitude. This was the extreme southern limit reached by\nthat daring traveller.\n\nHe returned in the month of August to Kouka; from there he successively\ntraversed the Mandara, Barghimi, and Klanem countries, and reached his\nextreme limit in the east, the town of Masena, situated at seventeen\ndegrees twenty minutes west longitude.\n\nOn the 25th of November, 1852, after the death of Overweg, his last\ncompanion, he plunged into the west, visited Sockoto, crossed the Niger,\nand finally reached Timbuctoo, where he had to languish, during eight\nlong months, under vexations inflicted upon him by the sheik, and all\nkinds of ill-treatment and wretchedness. But the presence of a Christian\nin the city could not long be tolerated, and the Foullans threatened to\nbesiege it. The doctor, therefore, left it on the 17th of March, 1854,\nand fled to the frontier, where he remained for thirty-three days in\nthe most abject destitution. He then managed to get back to Kano in\nNovember, thence to Kouka, where he resumed Denham's route after four\nmonths' delay. He regained Tripoli toward the close of August, 1855,\nand arrived in London on the 6th of September, the only survivor of his\nparty.\n\nSuch was the venturesome journey of Dr. Barth.\n\nDr. Ferguson carefully noted the fact, that he had stopped at four\ndegrees north latitude and seventeen degrees west longitude.\n\nNow let us see what Lieutenants Burton and Speke accomplished in Eastern\nAfrica.\n\nThe various expeditions that had ascended the Nile could never manage to\nreach the mysterious source of that river. According to the narrative\nof the German doctor, Ferdinand Werne, the expedition attempted in 1840,\nunder the auspices of Mehemet Ali, stopped at Gondokoro, between the\nfourth and fifth parallels of north latitude.\n\nIn 1855, Brun-Rollet, a native of Savoy, appointed consul for Sardinia\nin Eastern Soudan, to take the place of Vaudey, who had just died, set\nout from Karthoum, and, under the name of Yacoub the merchant, trading\nin gums and ivory, got as far as Belenia, beyond the fourth degree, but\nhad to return in ill-health to Karthoum, where he died in 1857.\n\nNeither Dr. Penney--the head of the Egyptian medical service, who, in\na small steamer, penetrated one degree beyond Gondokoro, and then came\nback to die of exhaustion at Karthoum--nor Miani, the Venetian, who,\nturning the cataracts below Gondokoro, reached the second parallel--nor\nthe Maltese trader, Andrea Debono, who pushed his journey up the Nile\nstill farther--could work their way beyond the apparently impassable\nlimit.\n\nIn 1859, M. Guillaume Lejean, intrusted with a mission by the French\nGovernment, reached Karthoum by way of the Red Sea, and embarked upon\nthe Nile with a retinue of twenty-one hired men and twenty soldiers, but\nhe could not get past Gondokoro, and ran extreme risk of his life among\nthe negro tribes, who were in full revolt. The expedition directed by M.\nd'Escayrac de Lauture made an equally unsuccessful attempt to reach the\nfamous sources of the Nile.\n\nThis fatal limit invariably brought every traveller to a halt. In\nancient times, the ambassadors of Nero reached the ninth degree of\nlatitude, but in eighteen centuries only from five to six degrees, or\nfrom three hundred to three hundred and sixty geographical miles, were\ngained.\n\nMany travellers endeavored to reach the sources of the Nile by taking\ntheir point of departure on the eastern coast of Africa.\n\nBetween 1768 and 1772 the Scotch traveller, Bruce, set out from\nMassowah, a port of Abyssinia, traversed the Tigre, visited the ruins of\nAxum, saw the sources of the Nile where they did not exist, and obtained\nno serious result.\n\nIn 1844, Dr. Krapf, an Anglican missionary, founded an establishment\nat Monbaz, on the coast of Zanguebar, and, in company with the Rev. Dr.\nRebmann, discovered two mountain-ranges three hundred miles from the\ncoast. These were the mountains of Kilimandjaro and Kenia, which Messrs.\nde Heuglin and Thornton have partly scaled so recently.\n\nIn 1845, Maizan, the French explorer, disembarked, alone, at Bagamayo,\ndirectly opposite to Zanzibar, and got as far as Deje-la-Mhora, where\nthe chief caused him to be put to death in the most cruel torment.\n\nIn 1859, in the month of August, the young traveller, Roscher, from\nHamburg, set out with a caravan of Arab merchants, reached Lake Nyassa,\nand was there assassinated while he slept.\n\nFinally, in 1857, Lieutenants Burton and Speke, both officers in the\nBengal army, were sent by the London Geographical Society to explore the\ngreat African lakes, and on the 17th of June they quitted Zanzibar, and\nplunged directly into the west.\n\nAfter four months of incredible suffering, their baggage having been\npillaged, and their attendants beaten and slain, they arrived at Kazeh,\na sort of central rendezvous for traders and caravans. They were in the\nmidst of the country of the Moon, and there they collected some precious\ndocuments concerning the manners, government, religion, fauna, and flora\nof the region. They next made for the first of the great lakes, the\none named Tanganayika, situated between the third and eighth degrees\nof south latitude. They reached it on the 14th of February, 1858, and\nvisited the various tribes residing on its banks, the most of whom are\ncannibals.\n\nThey departed again on the 26th of May, and reentered Kazeh on the 20th\nof June. There Burton, who was completely worn out, lay ill for several\nmonths, during which time Speke made a push to the northward of more\nthan three hundred miles, going as far as Lake Okeracua, which he came\nin sight of on the 3d of August; but he could descry only the opening of\nit at latitude two degrees thirty minutes.\n\nHe reached Kazeh, on his return, on the 25th of August, and, in company\nwith Burton, again took up the route to Zanzibar, where they arrived\nin the month of March in the following year. These two daring explorers\nthen reembarked for England; and the Geographical Society of Paris\ndecreed them its annual prize medal.\n\nDr. Ferguson carefully remarked that they had not gone beyond the second\ndegree of south latitude, nor the twenty-ninth of east longitude.\n\nThe problem, therefore, was how to link the explorations of Burton\nand Speke with those of Dr. Barth, since to do so was to undertake to\ntraverse an extent of more than twelve degrees of territory.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIFTH.\n\nKennedy's Dreams.--Articles and Pronouns in the Plural.--Dick's\nInsinuations.--A Promenade over the Map of Africa.--What is contained\nbetween two Points of the Compass.--Expeditions now on foot.--Speke and\nGrant.--Krapf, De Decken, and De Heuglin.\n\nDr. Ferguson energetically pushed the preparations for his departure,\nand in person superintended the construction of his balloon, with\ncertain modifications; in regard to which he observed the most absolute\nsilence. For a long time past he had been applying himself to the study\nof the Arab language and the various Mandingoe idioms, and, thanks to\nhis talents as a polyglot, he had made rapid progress.\n\nIn the mean while his friend, the sportsman, never let him out of his\nsight--afraid, no doubt, that the doctor might take his departure,\nwithout saying a word to anybody. On this subject, he regaled him with\nthe most persuasive arguments, which, however, did NOT persuade Samuel\nFerguson, and wasted his breath in pathetic entreaties, by which the\nlatter seemed to be but slightly moved. In fine, Dick felt that the\ndoctor was slipping through his fingers.\n\nThe poor Scot was really to be pitied. He could not look upon the azure\nvault without a sombre terror: when asleep, he felt oscillations that\nmade his head reel; and every night he had visions of being swung aloft\nat immeasurable heights.\n\nWe must add that, during these fearful nightmares, he once or twice fell\nout of bed. His first care then was to show Ferguson a severe contusion\nthat he had received on the cranium. \"And yet,\" he would add, with\nwarmth, \"that was at the height of only three feet--not an inch\nmore--and such a bump as this! Only think, then!\"\n\nThis insinuation, full of sad meaning as it was, did not seem to touch\nthe doctor's heart.\n\n\"We'll not fall,\" was his invariable reply.\n\n\"But, still, suppose that we WERE to fall!\"\n\n\"We will NOT fall!\"\n\nThis was decisive, and Kennedy had nothing more to say.\n\nWhat particularly exasperated Dick was, that the doctor seemed\ncompletely to lose sight of his personality--of his--Kennedy's--and to\nlook upon him as irrevocably destined to become his aerial companion.\nNot even the shadow of a doubt was ever suggested; and Samuel made an\nintolerable misuse of the first person plural:\n\n\"'We' are getting along; 'we' shall be ready on the----; 'we' shall\nstart on the----,\" etc., etc.\n\nAnd then there was the singular possessive adjective:\n\n\"'Our' balloon; 'our' car; 'our' expedition.\"\n\nAnd the same in the plural, too:\n\n\"'Our' preparations; 'our' discoveries; 'our' ascensions.\"\n\nDick shuddered at them, although he was determined not to go; but he\ndid not want to annoy his friend. Let us also disclose the fact that,\nwithout knowing exactly why himself, he had sent to Edinburgh for a\ncertain selection of heavy clothing, and his best hunting-gear and\nfire-arms.\n\nOne day, after having admitted that, with an overwhelming run of\ngood-luck, there MIGHT be one chance of success in a thousand, he\npretended to yield entirely to the doctor's wishes; but, in order\nto still put off the journey, he opened the most varied series of\nsubterfuges. He threw himself back upon questioning the utility of the\nexpedition--its opportuneness, etc. This discovery of the sources of the\nNile, was it likely to be of any use?--Would one have really labored\nfor the welfare of humanity?--When, after all, the African tribes should\nhave been civilized, would they be any happier?--Were folks certain\nthat civilization had not its chosen abode there rather than in\nEurope?--Perhaps!--And then, couldn't one wait a little longer?--The\ntrip across Africa would certainly be accomplished some day, and in a\nless hazardous manner.--In another month, or in six months before the\nyear was over, some explorer would undoubtedly come in--etc., etc.\n\nThese hints produced an effect exactly opposite to what was desired or\nintended, and the doctor trembled with impatience.\n\n\"Are you willing, then, wretched Dick--are you willing, false\nfriend--that this glory should belong to another? Must I then be untrue\nto my past history; recoil before obstacles that are not serious;\nrequite with cowardly hesitation what both the English Government and\nthe Royal Society of London have done for me?\"\n\n\"But,\" resumed Kennedy, who made great use of that conjunction.\n\n\"But,\" said the doctor, \"are you not aware that my journey is to compete\nwith the success of the expeditions now on foot? Don't you know that\nfresh explorers are advancing toward the centre of Africa?\"\n\n\"Still--\"\n\n\"Listen to me, Dick, and cast your eyes over that map.\"\n\nDick glanced over it, with resignation.\n\n\"Now, ascend the course of the Nile.\"\n\n\"I have ascended it,\" replied the Scotchman, with docility.\n\n\"Stop at Gondokoro.\"\n\n\"I am there.\"\n\nAnd Kennedy thought to himself how easy such a trip was--on the map!\n\n\"Now, take one of the points of these dividers and let it rest upon that\nplace beyond which the most daring explorers have scarcely gone.\"\n\n\"I have done so.\"\n\n\"And now look along the coast for the island of Zanzibar, in latitude\nsix degrees south.\"\n\n\"I have it.\"\n\n\"Now, follow the same parallel and arrive at Kazeh.\"\n\n\"I have done so.\"\n\n\"Run up again along the thirty-third degree of longitude to the opening\nof Lake Oukereoue, at the point where Lieutenant Speke had to halt.\"\n\n\"I am there; a little more, and I should have tumbled into the lake.\"\n\n\"Very good! Now, do you know what we have the right to suppose,\naccording to the information given by the tribes that live along its\nshores?\"\n\n\"I haven't the least idea.\"\n\n\"Why, that this lake, the lower extremity of which is in two degrees\nand thirty minutes, must extend also two degrees and a half above the\nequator.\"\n\n\"Really!\"\n\n\"Well from this northern extremity there flows a stream which must\nnecessarily join the Nile, if it be not the Nile itself.\"\n\n\"That is, indeed, curious.\"\n\n\"Then, let the other point of your dividers rest upon that extremity of\nLake Oukereoue.\"\n\n\"It is done, friend Ferguson.\"\n\n\"Now, how many degrees can you count between the two points?\"\n\n\"Scarcely two.\"\n\n\"And do you know what that means, Dick?\"\n\n\"Not the least in the world.\"\n\n\"Why, that makes scarcely one hundred and twenty miles--in other words,\na nothing.\"\n\n\"Almost nothing, Samuel.\"\n\n\"Well, do you know what is taking place at this moment?\"\n\n\"No, upon my honor, I do not.\"\n\n\"Very well, then, I'll tell you. The Geographical Society regard as very\nimportant the exploration of this lake of which Speke caught a glimpse.\nUnder their auspices, Lieutenant (now Captain) Speke has associated with\nhim Captain Grant, of the army in India; they have put themselves at\nthe head of a numerous and well-equipped expedition; their mission is to\nascend the lake and return to Gondokoro; they have received a subsidy\nof more than five thousand pounds, and the Governor of the Cape of Good\nHope has placed Hottentot soldiers at their disposal; they set out\nfrom Zanzibar at the close of October, 1860. In the mean while John\nPetherick, the English consul at the city of Karthoum, has received\nabout seven hundred pounds from the foreign office; he is to equip a\nsteamer at Karthoum, stock it with sufficient provisions, and make his\nway to Gondokoro; there, he will await Captain Speke's caravan, and be\nable to replenish its supplies to some extent.\"\n\n\"Well planned,\" said Kennedy.\n\n\"You can easily see, then, that time presses if we are to take part in\nthese exploring labors. And that is not all, since, while some are thus\nadvancing with sure steps to the discovery of the sources of the Nile,\nothers are penetrating to the very heart of Africa.\"\n\n\"On foot?\" said Kennedy.\n\n\"Yes, on foot,\" rejoined the doctor, without noticing the insinuation.\n\"Doctor Krapf proposes to push forward, in the west, by way of the Djob,\na river lying under the equator. Baron de Decken has already set out\nfrom Monbaz, has reconnoitred the mountains of Kenaia and Kilimandjaro,\nand is now plunging in toward the centre.\"\n\n\"But all this time on foot?\"\n\n\"On foot or on mules.\"\n\n\"Exactly the same, so far as I am concerned,\" ejaculated Kennedy.\n\n\"Lastly,\" resumed the doctor, \"M. de Heuglin, the Austrian vice-consul\nat Karthoum, has just organized a very important expedition, the first\naim of which is to search for the traveller Vogel, who, in 1853, was\nsent into the Soudan to associate himself with the labors of Dr. Barth.\nIn 1856, he quitted Bornou, and determined to explore the unknown\ncountry that lies between Lake Tchad and Darfur. Nothing has been seen\nof him since that time. Letters that were received in Alexandria, in\n1860, said that he was killed at the order of the King of Wadai; but\nother letters, addressed by Dr. Hartmann to the traveller's father,\nrelate that, according to the recital of a felatah of Bornou, Vogel was\nmerely held as a prisoner at Wara. All hope is not then lost. Hence,\na committee has been organized under the presidency of the Regent of\nSaxe-Cogurg-Gotha; my friend Petermann is its secretary; a national\nsubscription has provided for the expense of the expedition, whose\nstrength has been increased by the voluntary accession of several\nlearned men, and M. de Heuglin set out from Massowah, in the month of\nJune. While engaged in looking for Vogel, he is also to explore all\nthe country between the Nile and Lake Tchad, that is to say, to knit\ntogether the operations of Captain Speke and those of Dr. Barth, and\nthen Africa will have been traversed from east to west.\"*\n\n     * After the departure of Dr. Ferguson, it was ascertained\n     that M. de Heuglin, owing to some disagreement, took a route\n     different from the one assigned to his expedition, the\n     command of the latter having been transferred to Mr.\n     Muntzinger.\n\n\"Well,\" said the canny Scot, \"since every thing is getting on so well,\nwhat's the use of our going down there?\"\n\nDr. Ferguson made no reply, but contented himself with a significant\nshrug of the shoulders.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIXTH.\n\nA Servant--match him!--He can see the Satellites of Jupiter.--Dick\nand Joe hard at it.--Doubt and Faith.--The Weighing Ceremony.--Joe and\nWellington.--He gets a Half-crown.\n\nDr. Ferguson had a servant who answered with alacrity to the name\nof Joe. He was an excellent fellow, who testified the most absolute\nconfidence in his master, and the most unlimited devotion to his\ninterests, even anticipating his wishes and orders, which were always\nintelligently executed. In fine, he was a Caleb without the growling,\nand a perfect pattern of constant good-humor. Had he been made on\npurpose for the place, it could not have been better done. Ferguson\nput himself entirely in his hands, so far as the ordinary details of\nexistence were concerned, and he did well. Incomparable, whole-souled\nJoe! a servant who orders your dinner; who likes what you like; who\npacks your trunk, without forgetting your socks or your linen; who has\ncharge of your keys and your secrets, and takes no advantage of all\nthis!\n\nBut then, what a man the doctor was in the eyes of this worthy Joe! With\nwhat respect and what confidence the latter received all his decisions!\nWhen Ferguson had spoken, he would be a fool who should attempt to\nquestion the matter. Every thing he thought was exactly right; every\nthing he said, the perfection of wisdom; every thing he ordered to be\ndone, quite feasible; all that he undertook, practicable; all that\nhe accomplished, admirable. You might have cut Joe to pieces--not an\nagreeable operation, to be sure--and yet he would not have altered his\nopinion of his master.\n\nSo, when the doctor conceived the project of crossing Africa through the\nair, for Joe the thing was already done; obstacles no longer existed;\nfrom the moment when the doctor had made up his mind to start, he had\narrived--along with his faithful attendant, too, for the noble fellow\nknew, without a word uttered about it, that he would be one of the\nparty.\n\nMoreover, he was just the man to render the greatest service by his\nintelligence and his wonderful agility. Had the occasion arisen to name\na professor of gymnastics for the monkeys in the Zoological Garden (who\nare smart enough, by-the-way!), Joe would certainly have received the\nappointment. Leaping, climbing, almost flying--these were all sport to\nhim.\n\nIf Ferguson was the head and Kennedy the arm, Joe was to be the right\nhand of the expedition. He had, already, accompanied his master on\nseveral journeys, and had a smattering of science appropriate to his\ncondition and style of mind, but he was especially remarkable for a\nsort of mild philosophy, a charming turn of optimism. In his sight every\nthing was easy, logical, natural, and, consequently, he could see no use\nin complaining or grumbling.\n\nAmong other gifts, he possessed a strength and range of vision that\nwere perfectly surprising. He enjoyed, in common with Moestlin, Kepler's\nprofessor, the rare faculty of distinguishing the satellites of Jupiter\nwith the naked eye, and of counting fourteen of the stars in the group\nof Pleiades, the remotest of them being only of the ninth magnitude.\nHe presumed none the more for that; on the contrary, he made his bow to\nyou, at a distance, and when occasion arose he bravely knew how to use\nhis eyes.\n\nWith such profound faith as Joe felt in the doctor, it is not to\nbe wondered at that incessant discussions sprang up between him and\nKennedy, without any lack of respect to the latter, however.\n\nOne doubted, the other believed; one had a prudent foresight, the\nother blind confidence. The doctor, however, vibrated between doubt and\nconfidence; that is to say, he troubled his head with neither one nor\nthe other.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Kennedy,\" Joe would say.\n\n\"Well, my boy?\"\n\n\"The moment's at hand. It seems that we are to sail for the moon.\"\n\n\"You mean the Mountains of the Moon, which are not quite so far off.\nBut, never mind, one trip is just as dangerous as the other!\"\n\n\"Dangerous! What! with a man like Dr. Ferguson?\"\n\n\"I don't want to spoil your illusions, my good Joe; but this undertaking\nof his is nothing more nor less than the act of a madman. He won't go,\nthough!\"\n\n\"He won't go, eh? Then you haven't seen his balloon at Mitchell's\nfactory in the Borough?\"\n\n\"I'll take precious good care to keep away from it!\"\n\n\"Well, you'll lose a fine sight, sir. What a splendid thing it is! What\na pretty shape! What a nice car! How snug we'll feel in it!\"\n\n\"Then you really think of going with your master?\"\n\n\"I?\" answered Joe, with an accent of profound conviction. \"Why, I'd go\nwith him wherever he pleases! Who ever heard of such a thing? Leave him\nto go off alone, after we've been all over the world together! Who would\nhelp him, when he was tired? Who would give him a hand in climbing over\nthe rocks? Who would attend him when he was sick? No, Mr. Kennedy, Joe\nwill always stick to the doctor!\"\n\n\"You're a fine fellow, Joe!\"\n\n\"But, then, you're coming with us!\"\n\n\"Oh! certainly,\" said Kennedy; \"that is to say, I will go with you up to\nthe last moment, to prevent Samuel even then from being guilty of such\nan act of folly! I will follow him as far as Zanzibar, so as to stop him\nthere, if possible.\"\n\n\"You'll stop nothing at all, Mr. Kennedy, with all respect to you, sir.\nMy master is no hare-brained person; he takes a long time to think over\nwhat he means to do, and then, when he once gets started, the Evil One\nhimself couldn't make him give it up.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll see about that.\"\n\n\"Don't flatter yourself, sir--but then, the main thing is, to have\nyou with us. For a hunter like you, sir, Africa's a great country. So,\neither way, you won't be sorry for the trip.\"\n\n\"No, that's a fact, I shan't be sorry for it, if I can get this crazy\nman to give up his scheme.\"\n\n\"By-the-way,\" said Joe, \"you know that the weighing comes off to-day.\"\n\n\"The weighing--what weighing?\"\n\n\"Why, my master, and you, and I, are all to be weighed to-day!\"\n\n\"What! like horse-jockeys?\"\n\n\"Yes, like jockeys. Only, never fear, you won't be expected to make\nyourself lean, if you're found to be heavy. You'll go as you are.\"\n\n\"Well, I can tell you, I am not going to let myself be weighed,\" said\nKennedy, firmly.\n\n\"But, sir, it seems that the doctor's machine requires it.\"\n\n\"Well, his machine will have to do without it.\"\n\n\"Humph! and suppose that it couldn't go up, then?\"\n\n\"Egad! that's all I want!\"\n\n\"Come! come, Mr. Kennedy! My master will be sending for us directly.\"\n\n\"I shan't go.\"\n\n\"Oh! now, you won't vex the doctor in that way!\"\n\n\"Aye! that I will.\"\n\n\"Well!\" said Joe with a laugh, \"you say that because he's not here;\nbut when he says to your face, 'Dick!' (with all respect to you, sir,)\n'Dick, I want to know exactly how much you weigh,' you'll go, I warrant\nit.\"\n\n\"No, I will NOT go!\"\n\nAt this moment the doctor entered his study, where this discussion had\nbeen taking place; and, as he came in, cast a glance at Kennedy, who did\nnot feel altogether at his ease.\n\n\"Dick,\" said the doctor, \"come with Joe; I want to know how much you\nboth weigh.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"You may keep your hat on. Come!\" And Kennedy went.\n\nThey repaired in company to the workshop of the Messrs. Mitchell,\nwhere one of those so-called \"Roman\" scales was in readiness. It\nwas necessary, by the way, for the doctor to know the weight of his\ncompanions, so as to fix the equilibrium of his balloon; so he made Dick\nget up on the platform of the scales. The latter, without making any\nresistance, said, in an undertone:\n\n\"Oh! well, that doesn't bind me to any thing.\"\n\n\"One hundred and fifty-three pounds,\" said the doctor, noting it down on\nhis tablets.\n\n\"Am I too heavy?\"\n\n\"Why, no, Mr. Kennedy!\" said Joe; \"and then, you know, I am light to\nmake up for it.\"\n\nSo saying, Joe, with enthusiasm, took his place on the scales, and\nvery nearly upset them in his ready haste. He struck the attitude of\nWellington where he is made to ape Achilles, at Hyde-Park entrance, and\nwas superb in it, without the shield.\n\n\"One hundred and twenty pounds,\" wrote the doctor.\n\n\"Ah! ha!\" said Joe, with a smile of satisfaction And why did he smile?\nHe never could tell himself.\n\n\"It's my turn now,\" said Ferguson--and he put down one hundred and\nthirty-five pounds to his own account.\n\n\"All three of us,\" said he, \"do not weigh much more than four hundred\npounds.\"\n\n\"But, sir,\" said Joe, \"if it was necessary for your expedition, I could\nmake myself thinner by twenty pounds, by not eating so much.\"\n\n\"Useless, my boy!\" replied the doctor. \"You may eat as much as you like,\nand here's half-a-crown to buy you the ballast.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVENTH.\n\nGeometrical Details.--Calculation of the Capacity of the Balloon.--The\nDouble Receptacle.--The Covering.--The Car.--The Mysterious\nApparatus.--The Provisions and Stores.--The Final Summing up.\n\nDr. Ferguson had long been engaged upon the details of his expedition.\nIt is easy to comprehend that the balloon--that marvellous vehicle\nwhich was to convey him through the air--was the constant object of his\nsolicitude.\n\nAt the outset, in order not to give the balloon too ponderous\ndimensions, he had decided to fill it with hydrogen gas, which is\nfourteen and a half times lighter than common air. The production of\nthis gas is easy, and it has given the greatest satisfaction hitherto in\naerostatic experiments.\n\nThe doctor, according to very accurate calculations, found that,\nincluding the articles indispensable to his journey and his apparatus,\nhe should have to carry a weight of 4,000 pounds; therefore he had to\nfind out what would be the ascensional force of a balloon capable of\nraising such a weight, and, consequently, what would be its capacity.\n\nA weight of four thousand pounds is represented by a displacement of the\nair amounting to forty-four thousand eight hundred and forty-seven\ncubic feet; or, in other words, forty-four thousand eight hundred and\nforty-seven cubic feet of air weigh about four thousand pounds.\n\nBy giving the balloon these cubic dimensions, and filling it with\nhydrogen gas, instead of common air--the former being fourteen and\na half times lighter and weighing therefore only two hundred and\nseventy-six pounds--a difference of three thousand seven hundred and\ntwenty-four pounds in equilibrium is produced; and it is this difference\nbetween the weight of the gas contained in the balloon and the weight of\nthe surrounding atmosphere that constitutes the ascensional force of the\nformer.\n\nHowever, were the forty-four thousand eight hundred and forty-seven\ncubic feet of gas of which we speak, all introduced into the balloon, it\nwould be entirely filled; but that would not do, because, as the balloon\ncontinued to mount into the more rarefied layers of the atmosphere,\nthe gas within would dilate, and soon burst the cover containing it.\nBalloons, then, are usually only two-thirds filled.\n\nBut the doctor, in carrying out a project known only to himself,\nresolved to fill his balloon only one-half; and, since he had to carry\nforty-four thousand eight hundred and forty-seven cubic feet of gas,\nto give his balloon nearly double capacity he arranged it in that\nelongated, oval shape which has come to be preferred. The horizontal\ndiameter was fifty feet, and the vertical diameter seventy-five feet.\nHe thus obtained a spheroid, the capacity of which amounted, in round\nnumbers, to ninety thousand cubic feet.\n\nCould Dr. Ferguson have used two balloons, his chances of success would\nhave been increased; for, should one burst in the air, he could, by\nthrowing out ballast, keep himself up with the other. But the management\nof two balloons would, necessarily, be very difficult, in view of the\nproblem how to keep them both at an equal ascensional force.\n\nAfter having pondered the matter carefully, Dr. Ferguson, by an\ningenious arrangement, combined the advantages of two balloons, without\nincurring their inconveniences. He constructed two of different sizes,\nand inclosed the smaller in the larger one. His external balloon, which\nhad the dimensions given above, contained a less one of the same shape,\nwhich was only forty-five feet in horizontal, and sixty-eight feet\nin vertical diameter. The capacity of this interior balloon was\nonly sixty-seven thousand cubic feet: it was to float in the fluid\nsurrounding it. A valve opened from one balloon into the other, and thus\nenabled the aeronaut to communicate with both.\n\nThis arrangement offered the advantage, that if gas had to be let off,\nso as to descend, that which was in the outer balloon would go first;\nand, were it completely emptied, the smaller one would still remain\nintact. The outer envelope might then be cast off as a useless\nencumbrance; and the second balloon, left free to itself, would not\noffer the same hold to the currents of air as a half-inflated one must\nneeds present.\n\nMoreover, in case of an accident happening to the outside balloon, such\nas getting torn, for instance, the other would remain intact.\n\nThe balloons were made of a strong but light Lyons silk, coated with\ngutta percha. This gummy, resinous substance is absolutely water-proof,\nand also resists acids and gas perfectly. The silk was doubled, at the\nupper extremity of the oval, where most of the strain would come.\n\nSuch an envelope as this could retain the inflating fluid for any length\nof time. It weighed half a pound per nine square feet. Hence the surface\nof the outside balloon being about eleven thousand six hundred square\nfeet, its envelope weighed six hundred and fifty pounds. The envelope\nof the second or inner balloon, having nine thousand two hundred square\nfeet of surface, weighed only about five hundred and ten pounds, or say\neleven hundred and sixty pounds for both.\n\nThe network that supported the car was made of very strong hempen\ncord, and the two valves were the object of the most minute and careful\nattention, as the rudder of a ship would be.\n\nThe car, which was of a circular form and fifteen feet in diameter, was\nmade of wicker-work, strengthened with a slight covering of iron, and\nprotected below by a system of elastic springs, to deaden the shock of\ncollision. Its weight, along with that of the network, did not exceed\ntwo hundred and fifty pounds.\n\nIn addition to the above, the doctor caused to be constructed two\nsheet-iron chests two lines in thickness. These were connected by means\nof pipes furnished with stopcocks. He joined to these a spiral, two\ninches in diameter, which terminated in two branch pieces of unequal\nlength, the longer of which, however, was twenty-five feet in height and\nthe shorter only fifteen feet.\n\nThese sheet-iron chests were embedded in the car in such a way as to\ntake up the least possible amount of space. The spiral, which was not to\nbe adjusted until some future moment, was packed up, separately, along\nwith a very strong Buntzen electric battery. This apparatus had been\nso ingeniously combined that it did not weigh more than seven hundred\npounds, even including twenty-five gallons of water in another\nreceptacle.\n\nThe instruments provided for the journey consisted of two barometers,\ntwo thermometers, two compasses, a sextant, two chronometers, an\nartificial horizon, and an altazimuth, to throw out the height of\ndistant and inaccessible objects.\n\nThe Greenwich Observatory had placed itself at the doctor's disposal.\nThe latter, however, did not intend to make experiments in physics; he\nmerely wanted to be able to know in what direction he was passing, and\nto determine the position of the principal rivers, mountains, and towns.\n\nHe also provided himself with three thoroughly tested iron anchors, and\na light but strong silk ladder fifty feet in length.\n\nHe at the same time carefully weighed his stores of provision, which\nconsisted of tea, coffee, biscuit, salted meat, and pemmican, a\npreparation which comprises many nutritive elements in a small space.\nBesides a sufficient stock of pure brandy, he arranged two water-tanks,\neach of which contained twenty-two gallons.\n\nThe consumption of these articles would necessarily, little by little,\ndiminish the weight to be sustained, for it must be remembered that\nthe equilibrium of a balloon floating in the atmosphere is extremely\nsensitive. The loss of an almost insignificant weight suffices to\nproduce a very noticeable displacement.\n\nNor did the doctor forget an awning to shelter the car, nor the\ncoverings and blankets that were to be the bedding of the journey, nor\nsome fowling pieces and rifles, with their requisite supply of powder\nand ball.\n\nHere is the summing up of his various items, and their weight, as he\ncomputed it:\n\n       Ferguson...........................  135 pounds.\n       Kennedy............................  153   \"\n       Joe................................  120   \"\n       Weight of the outside balloon......  650   \"\n       Weight of the second balloon.......  510   \"\n       Car and network....................  280   \"\n       Anchors, instruments, awnings,\n         and sundry utensils, guns,\n         coverings, etc...................  190   \"\n       Meat, pemmican, biscuits, tea,\n         coffee, brandy...................  386   \"\n       Water..............................  400   \"\n       Apparatus..........................  700   \"\n       Weight of the hydrogen.............  276   \"\n       Ballast............................  200   \"\n                                         -----\n                                          4,000 pounds.\n\nSuch were the items of the four thousand pounds that Dr. Ferguson\nproposed to carry up with him. He took only two hundred pounds of\nballast for \"unforeseen emergencies,\" as he remarked, since otherwise he\ndid not expect to use any, thanks to the peculiarity of his apparatus.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHTH.\n\nJoe's Importance.--The Commander of the Resolute.--Kennedy's\nArsenal.--Mutual Amenities.--The Farewell Dinner.--Departure on the\n21st of February.--The Doctor's Scientific\nSessions.--Duveyrier.--Livingstone.--Details of the Aerial\nVoyage.--Kennedy silenced.\n\nAbout the 10th of February, the preparations were pretty well completed;\nand the balloons, firmly secured, one within the other, were altogether\nfinished. They had been subjected to a powerful pneumatic pressure in\nall parts, and the test gave excellent evidence of their solidity and of\nthe care applied in their construction.\n\nJoe hardly knew what he was about, with delight. He trotted incessantly\nto and fro between his home in Greek Street, and the Mitchell\nestablishment, always full of business, but always in the highest\nspirits, giving details of the affair to people who did not even ask\nhim, so proud was he, above all things, of being permitted to accompany\nhis master. I have even a shrewd suspicion that what with showing the\nballoon, explaining the plans and views of the doctor, giving folks a\nglimpse of the latter, through a half-opened window, or pointing him\nout as he passed along the streets, the clever scamp earned a few\nhalf-crowns, but we must not find fault with him for that. He had\nas much right as anybody else to speculate upon the admiration and\ncuriosity of his contemporaries.\n\nOn the 16th of February, the Resolute cast anchor near Greenwich. She\nwas a screw propeller of eight hundred tons, a fast sailer, and the very\nvessel that had been sent out to the polar regions, to revictual the\nlast expedition of Sir James Ross. Her commander, Captain Bennet,\nhad the name of being a very amiable person, and he took a particular\ninterest in the doctor's expedition, having been one of that gentleman's\nadmirers for a long time. Bennet was rather a man of science than a man\nof war, which did not, however, prevent his vessel from carrying four\ncarronades, that had never hurt any body, to be sure, but had performed\nthe most pacific duty in the world.\n\nThe hold of the Resolute was so arranged as to find a stowing-place for\nthe balloon. The latter was shipped with the greatest precaution on the\n18th of February, and was then carefully deposited at the bottom of\nthe vessel in such a way as to prevent accident. The car and its\naccessories, the anchors, the cords, the supplies, the water-tanks,\nwhich were to be filled on arriving, all were embarked and put away\nunder Ferguson's own eyes.\n\nTen tons of sulphuric acid and ten tons of iron filings, were put on\nboard for the future production of the hydrogen gas. The quantity was\nmore than enough, but it was well to be provided against accident. The\napparatus to be employed in manufacturing the gas, including some thirty\nempty casks, was also stowed away in the hold.\n\nThese various preparations were terminated on the 18th of February, in\nthe evening. Two state-rooms, comfortably fitted up, were ready for the\nreception of Dr. Ferguson and his friend Kennedy. The latter, all\nthe while swearing that he would not go, went on board with a regular\narsenal of hunting weapons, among which were two double-barrelled\nbreech-loading fowling-pieces, and a rifle that had withstood every\ntest, of the make of Purdey, Moore & Dickson, at Edinburgh. With such\na weapon a marksman would find no difficulty in lodging a bullet in the\neye of a chamois at the distance of two thousand paces. Along with\nthese implements, he had two of Colt's six-shooters, for unforeseen\nemergencies. His powder-case, his cartridge-pouch, his lead, and his\nbullets, did not exceed a certain weight prescribed by the doctor.\n\nThe three travellers got themselves to rights on board during the\nworking-hours of February 19th. They were received with much distinction\nby the captain and his officers, the doctor continuing as reserved as\never, and thinking of nothing but his expedition. Dick seemed a good\ndeal moved, but was unwilling to betray it; while Joe was fairly dancing\nand breaking out in laughable remarks. The worthy fellow soon became the\njester and merry-andrew of the boatswain's mess, where a berth had been\nkept for him.\n\nOn the 20th, a grand farewell dinner was given to Dr. Ferguson and\nKennedy by the Royal Geographical Society. Commander Bennet and his\nofficers were present at the entertainment, which was signalized by\ncopious libations and numerous toasts. Healths were drunk, in sufficient\nabundance to guarantee all the guests a lifetime of centuries. Sir\nFrancis M----presided, with restrained but dignified feeling.\n\nTo his own supreme confusion, Dick Kennedy came in for a large share\nin the jovial felicitations of the night. After having drunk to the\n\"intrepid Ferguson, the glory of England,\" they had to drink to \"the no\nless courageous Kennedy, his daring companion.\"\n\nDick blushed a good deal, and that passed for modesty; whereupon the\napplause redoubled, and Dick blushed again.\n\nA message from the Queen arrived while they were at dessert. Her Majesty\noffered her compliments to the two travellers, and expressed her\nwishes for their safe and successful journey. This, of course, rendered\nimperative fresh toasts to \"Her most gracious Majesty.\"\n\nAt midnight, after touching farewells and warm shaking of hands, the\nguests separated.\n\nThe boats of the Resolute were in waiting at the stairs of Westminster\nBridge. The captain leaped in, accompanied by his officers and\npassengers, and the rapid current of the Thames, aiding the strong arms\nof the rowers, bore them swiftly to Greenwich. In an hour's time all\nwere asleep on board.\n\nThe next morning, February 21st, at three o'clock, the furnaces began\nto roar; at five, the anchors were weighed, and the Resolute, powerfully\ndriven by her screw, began to plough the water toward the mouth of the\nThames.\n\nIt is needless to say that the topic of conversation with every one on\nboard was Dr. Ferguson's enterprise. Seeing and hearing the doctor soon\ninspired everybody with such confidence that, in a very short time,\nthere was no one, excepting the incredulous Scotchman, on the steamer\nwho had the least doubt of the perfect feasibility and success of the\nexpedition.\n\nDuring the long, unoccupied hours of the voyage, the doctor held regular\nsittings, with lectures on geographical science, in the officers'\nmess-room. These young men felt an intense interest in the discoveries\nmade during the last forty years in Africa; and the doctor related to\nthem the explorations of Barth, Burton, Speke, and Grant, and depicted\nthe wonders of this vast, mysterious country, now thrown open on\nall sides to the investigations of science. On the north, the young\nDuveyrier was exploring Sahara, and bringing the chiefs of the\nTouaregs to Paris. Under the inspiration of the French Government, two\nexpeditions were preparing, which, descending from the north, and coming\nfrom the west, would cross each other at Timbuctoo. In the south, the\nindefatigable Livingstone was still advancing toward the equator; and,\nsince March, 1862, he had, in company with Mackenzie, ascended the river\nRovoonia. The nineteenth century would, assuredly, not pass, contended\nthe doctor, without Africa having been compelled to surrender the\nsecrets she has kept locked up in her bosom for six thousand years.\n\nBut the interest of Dr. Ferguson's hearers was excited to the highest\npitch when he made known to them, in detail, the preparations for his\nown journey. They took pleasure in verifying his calculations; they\ndiscussed them; and the doctor frankly took part in the discussion.\n\nAs a general thing, they were surprised at the limited quantity of\nprovision that he took with him; and one day one of the officers\nquestioned him on that subject.\n\n\"That peculiar point astonishes you, does it?\" said Ferguson.\n\n\"It does, indeed.\"\n\n\"But how long do you think my trip is going to last? Whole months? If\nso, you are greatly mistaken. Were it to be a long one, we should be\nlost; we should never get back. But you must know that the distance from\nZanzibar to the coast of Senegal is only thirty-five hundred--say four\nthousand miles. Well, at the rate of two hundred and forty miles every\ntwelve hours, which does not come near the rapidity of our railroad\ntrains, by travelling day and night, it would take only seven days to\ncross Africa!\"\n\n\"But then you could see nothing, make no geographical observations, or\nreconnoitre the face of the country.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" replied the doctor, \"if I am master of my balloon--if I can ascend\nand descend at will, I shall stop when I please, especially when too\nviolent currents of air threaten to carry me out of my way with them.\"\n\n\"And you will encounter such,\" said Captain Bennet. \"There are tornadoes\nthat sweep at the rate of more than two hundred and forty miles per\nhour.\"\n\n\"You see, then, that with such speed as that, we could cross Africa in\ntwelve hours. One would rise at Zanzibar, and go to bed at St. Louis!\"\n\n\"But,\" rejoined the officer, \"could any balloon withstand the wear and\ntear of such velocity?\"\n\n\"It has happened before,\" replied Ferguson.\n\n\"And the balloon withstood it?\"\n\n\"Perfectly well. It was at the time of the coronation of Napoleon, in\n1804. The aeronaut, Gernerin, sent up a balloon at Paris, about eleven\no'clock in the evening. It bore the following inscription, in letters of\ngold: 'Paris, 25 Frimaire; year XIII; Coronation of the Emperor Napoleon\nby his Holiness, Pius VII.' On the next morning, the inhabitants of Rome\nsaw the same balloon soaring above the Vatican, whence it crossed the\nCampagna, and finally fluttered down into the lake of Bracciano. So you\nsee, gentlemen, that a balloon can resist such velocities.\"\n\n\"A balloon--that might be; but a man?\" insinuated Kennedy.\n\n\"Yes, a man, too!--for the balloon is always motionless with reference\nto the air that surrounds it. What moves is the mass of the atmosphere\nitself: for instance, one may light a taper in the car, and the flame\nwill not even waver. An aeronaut in Garnerin's balloon would not have\nsuffered in the least from the speed. But then I have no occasion\nto attempt such velocity; and if I can anchor to some tree, or some\nfavorable inequality of the ground, at night, I shall not fail to do so.\nBesides, we take provision for two months with us, after all; and there\nis nothing to prevent our skilful huntsman here from furnishing game in\nabundance when we come to alight.\"\n\n\"Ah! Mr. Kennedy,\" said a young midshipman, with envious eyes, \"what\nsplendid shots you'll have!\"\n\n\"Without counting,\" said another, \"that you'll have the glory as well as\nthe sport!\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" replied the hunter, stammering with confusion, \"I\ngreatly--appreciate--your compliments--but they--don't--belong to me.\"\n\n\"You!\" exclaimed every body, \"don't you intend to go?\"\n\n\"I am not going!\"\n\n\"You won't accompany Dr. Ferguson?\"\n\n\"Not only shall I not accompany him, but I am here so as to be present\nat the last moment to prevent his going.\"\n\nEvery eye was now turned to the doctor.\n\n\"Never mind him!\" said the latter, calmly. \"This is a matter that\nwe can't argue with him. At heart he knows perfectly well that he IS\ngoing.\"\n\n\"By Saint Andrew!\" said Kennedy, \"I swear--\"\n\n\"Swear to nothing, friend Dick; you have been ganged and weighed--you\nand your powder, your guns, and your bullets; so don't let us say\nanything more about it.\"\n\nAnd, in fact, from that day until the arrival at Zanzibar, Dick never\nopened his mouth. He talked neither about that nor about anything else.\nHe kept absolutely silent.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINTH.\n\nThey double the Cape.--The Forecastle.--A Course of Cosmography by\nProfessor Joe.--Concerning the Method of guiding Balloons.--How to seek\nout Atmospheric Currents.--Eureka.\n\nThe Resolute plunged along rapidly toward the Cape of Good Hope, the\nweather continuing fine, although the sea ran heavier.\n\nOn the 30th of March, twenty-seven days after the departure from London,\nthe Table Mountain loomed up on the horizon. Cape City lying at the foot\nof an amphitheatre of hills, could be distinguished through the ship's\nglasses, and soon the Resolute cast anchor in the port. But the captain\ntouched there only to replenish his coal bunkers, and that was but a\nday's job. On the morrow, he steered away to the south'ard, so as\nto double the southernmost point of Africa, and enter the Mozambique\nChannel.\n\nThis was not Joe's first sea-voyage, and so, for his part, he soon found\nhimself at home on board; every body liked him for his frankness and\ngood-humor. A considerable share of his master's renown was reflected\nupon him. He was listened to as an oracle, and he made no more mistakes\nthan the next one.\n\nSo, while the doctor was pursuing his descriptive course of lecturing in\nthe officers' mess, Joe reigned supreme on the forecastle, holding forth\nin his own peculiar manner, and making history to suit himself--a style\nof procedure pursued, by the way, by the greatest historians of all ages\nand nations.\n\nThe topic of discourse was, naturally, the aerial voyage. Joe had\nexperienced some trouble in getting the rebellious spirits to believe in\nit; but, once accepted by them, nothing connected with it was any longer\nan impossibility to the imaginations of the seamen stimulated by Joe's\nharangues.\n\nOur dazzling narrator persuaded his hearers that, after this trip, many\nothers still more wonderful would be undertaken. In fact, it was to be\nbut the first of a long series of superhuman expeditions.\n\n\"You see, my friends, when a man has had a taste of that kind of\ntravelling, he can't get along afterward with any other; so, on our\nnext expedition, instead of going off to one side, we'll go right ahead,\ngoing up, too, all the time.\"\n\n\"Humph! then you'll go to the moon!\" said one of the crowd, with a stare\nof amazement.\n\n\"To the moon!\" exclaimed Joe, \"To the moon! pooh! that's too common.\nEvery body might go to the moon, that way. Besides, there's no water\nthere, and you have to carry such a lot of it along with you. Then you\nhave to take air along in bottles, so as to breathe.\"\n\n\"Ay! ay! that's all right! But can a man get a drop of the real stuff\nthere?\" said a sailor who liked his toddy.\n\n\"Not a drop!\" was Joe's answer. \"No! old fellow, not in the moon. But\nwe're going to skip round among those little twinklers up there--the\nstars--and the splendid planets that my old man so often talks about.\nFor instance, we'll commence with Saturn--\"\n\n\"That one with the ring?\" asked the boatswain.\n\n\"Yes! the wedding-ring--only no one knows what's become of his wife!\"\n\n\"What? will you go so high up as that?\" said one of the ship-boys,\ngaping with wonder. \"Why, your master must be Old Nick himself.\"\n\n\"Oh! no, he's too good for that.\"\n\n\"But, after Saturn--what then?\" was the next inquiry of his impatient\naudience.\n\n\"After Saturn? Well, we'll visit Jupiter. A funny place that is, too,\nwhere the days are only nine hours and a half long--a good thing for the\nlazy fellows--and the years, would you believe it--last twelve of ours,\nwhich is fine for folks who have only six months to live. They get off a\nlittle longer by that.\"\n\n\"Twelve years!\" ejaculated the boy.\n\n\"Yes, my youngster; so that in that country you'd be toddling after your\nmammy yet, and that old chap yonder, who looks about fifty, would only\nbe a little shaver of four and a half.\"\n\n\"Blazes! that's a good 'un!\" shouted the whole forecastle together.\n\n\"Solemn truth!\" said Joe, stoutly.\n\n\"But what can you expect? When people will stay in this world, they\nlearn nothing and keep as ignorant as bears. But just come along to\nJupiter and you'll see. But they have to look out up there, for he's got\nsatellites that are not just the easiest things to pass.\"\n\nAll the men laughed, but they more than half believed him. Then he went\non to talk about Neptune, where seafaring men get a jovial reception,\nand Mars, where the military get the best of the sidewalk to such an\nextent that folks can hardly stand it. Finally, he drew them a heavenly\npicture of the delights of Venus.\n\n\"And when we get back from that expedition,\" said the indefatigable\nnarrator, \"they'll decorate us with the Southern Cross that shines up\nthere in the Creator's button-hole.\"\n\n\"Ay, and you'd have well earned it!\" said the sailors.\n\nThus passed the long evenings on the forecastle in merry chat, and\nduring the same time the doctor went on with his instructive discourses.\n\nOne day the conversation turned upon the means of directing balloons,\nand the doctor was asked his opinion about it.\n\n\"I don't think,\" said he, \"that we shall succeed in finding out a\nsystem of directing them. I am familiar with all the plans attempted\nand proposed, and not one has succeeded, not one is practicable. You may\nreadily understand that I have occupied my mind with this subject, which\nwas, necessarily, so interesting to me, but I have not been able to\nsolve the problem with the appliances now known to mechanical science.\nWe would have to discover a motive power of extraordinary force, and\nalmost impossible lightness of machinery. And, even then, we could not\nresist atmospheric currents of any considerable strength. Until now, the\neffort has been rather to direct the car than the balloon, and that has\nbeen one great error.\"\n\n\"Still there are many points of resemblance between a balloon and a ship\nwhich is directed at will.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" retorted the doctor, \"there is little or no similarity\nbetween the two cases. Air is infinitely less dense than water, in which\nthe ship is only half submerged, while the whole bulk of a balloon is\nplunged in the atmosphere, and remains motionless with reference to the\nelement that surrounds it.\"\n\n\"You think, then, that aerostatic science has said its last word?\"\n\n\"Not at all! not at all! But we must look for another point in the case,\nand if we cannot manage to guide our balloon, we must, at least, try to\nkeep it in favorable aerial currents. In proportion as we ascend,\nthe latter become much more uniform and flow more constantly in one\ndirection. They are no longer disturbed by the mountains and valleys\nthat traverse the surface of the globe, and these, you know, are the\nchief cause of the variations of the wind and the inequality of their\nforce. Therefore, these zones having been once determined, the balloon\nwill merely have to be placed in the currents best adapted to its\ndestination.\"\n\n\"But then,\" continued Captain Bennet, \"in order to reach them, you must\nkeep constantly ascending or descending. That is the real difficulty,\ndoctor.\"\n\n\"And why, my dear captain?\"\n\n\"Let us understand one another. It would be a difficulty and an obstacle\nonly for long journeys, and not for short aerial excursions.\"\n\n\"And why so, if you please?\"\n\n\"Because you can ascend only by throwing out ballast; you can descend\nonly after letting off gas, and by these processes your ballast and your\ngas are soon exhausted.\"\n\n\"My dear sir, that's the whole question. There is the only difficulty\nthat science need now seek to overcome. The problem is not how to guide\nthe balloon, but how to take it up and down without expending the\ngas which is its strength, its life-blood, its soul, if I may use the\nexpression.\"\n\n\"You are right, my dear doctor; but this problem is not yet solved; this\nmeans has not yet been discovered.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, it HAS been discovered.\"\n\n\"By whom?\"\n\n\"By me!\"\n\n\"By you?\"\n\n\"You may readily believe that otherwise I should not have risked this\nexpedition across Africa in a balloon. In twenty-four hours I should\nhave been without gas!\"\n\n\"But you said nothing about that in England?\"\n\n\"No! I did not want to have myself overhauled in public. I saw no use in\nthat. I made my preparatory experiments in secret and was satisfied. I\nhave no occasion, then, to learn any thing more from them.\"\n\n\"Well! doctor, would it be proper to ask what is your secret?\"\n\n\"Here it is, gentlemen--the simplest thing in the world!\"\n\nThe attention of his auditory was now directed to the doctor in the\nutmost degree as he quietly proceeded with his explanation.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TENTH.\n\nFormer Experiments.--The Doctor's Five Receptacles.--The Gas\nCylinder.--The Calorifere.--The System of Manoeuvring.--Success certain.\n\n\"The attempt has often been made, gentlemen,\" said the doctor, \"to rise\nand descend at will, without losing ballast or gas from the balloon. A\nFrench aeronaut, M. Meunier, tried to accomplish this by compressing air\nin an inner receptacle. A Belgian, Dr. Van Hecke, by means of wings\nand paddles, obtained a vertical power that would have sufficed in most\ncases, but the practical results secured from these experiments have\nbeen insignificant.\n\n\"I therefore resolved to go about the thing more directly; so, at the\nstart, I dispensed with ballast altogether, excepting as a provision for\ncases of special emergency, such as the breakage of my apparatus, or\nthe necessity of ascending very suddenly, so as to avoid unforeseen\nobstacles.\n\n\"My means of ascent and descent consist simply in dilating or\ncontracting the gas that is in the balloon by the application of\ndifferent temperatures, and here is the method of obtaining that result.\n\n\"You saw me bring on board with the car several cases or receptacles,\nthe use of which you may not have understood. They are five in number.\n\n\"The first contains about twenty-five gallons of water, to which I add\na few drops of sulphuric acid, so as to augment its capacity as a\nconductor of electricity, and then I decompose it by means of a powerful\nBuntzen battery. Water, as you know, consists of two parts of hydrogen\nto one of oxygen gas.\n\n\"The latter, through the action of the battery, passes at its positive\npole into the second receptacle. A third receptacle, placed above the\nsecond one, and of double its capacity, receives the hydrogen passing\ninto it by the negative pole.\n\n\"Stopcocks, of which one has an orifice twice the size of the other,\ncommunicate between these receptacles and a fourth one, which is\ncalled the mixture reservoir, since in it the two gases obtained by the\ndecomposition of the water do really commingle. The capacity of this\nfourth tank is about forty-one cubic feet.\n\n\"On the upper part of this tank is a platinum tube provided with a\nstopcock.\n\n\"You will now readily understand, gentlemen, the apparatus that I have\ndescribed to you is really a gas cylinder and blow-pipe for oxygen and\nhydrogen, the heat of which exceeds that of a forge fire.\n\n\"This much established, I proceed to the second part of my apparatus.\nFrom the lowest part of my balloon, which is hermetically closed, issue\ntwo tubes a little distance apart. The one starts among the upper layers\nof the hydrogen gas, the other amid the lower layers.\n\n\"These two pipes are provided at intervals with strong jointings of\nindia-rubber, which enable them to move in harmony with the oscillations\nof the balloon.\n\n\"Both of them run down as far as the car, and lose themselves in an\niron receptacle of cylindrical form, which is called the heat-tank. The\nlatter is closed at its two ends by two strong plates of the same metal.\n\n\"The pipe running from the lower part of the balloon runs into this\ncylindrical receptacle through the lower plate; it penetrates the latter\nand then takes the form of a helicoidal or screw-shaped spiral, the\nrings of which, rising one over the other, occupy nearly the whole of\nthe height of the tank. Before again issuing from it, this spiral runs\ninto a small cone with a concave base, that is turned downward in the\nshape of a spherical cap.\n\n\"It is from the top of this cone that the second pipe issues, and it\nruns, as I have said, into the upper beds of the balloon.\n\n\"The spherical cap of the small cone is of platinum, so as not to melt\nby the action of the cylinder and blow-pipe, for the latter are placed\nupon the bottom of the iron tank in the midst of the helicoidal\nspiral, and the extremity of their flame will slightly touch the cap in\nquestion.\n\n\"You all know, gentlemen, what a calorifere, to heat apartments, is. You\nknow how it acts. The air of the apartments is forced to pass through\nits pipes, and is then released with a heightened temperature. Well,\nwhat I have just described to you is nothing more nor less than a\ncalorifere.\n\n\"In fact, what is it that takes place? The cylinder once lighted, the\nhydrogen in the spiral and in the concave cone becomes heated, and\nrapidly ascends through the pipe that leads to the upper part of the\nballoon. A vacuum is created below, and it attracts the gas in the lower\nparts; this becomes heated in its turn, and is continually replaced;\nthus, an extremely rapid current of gas is established in the pipes and\nin the spiral, which issues from the balloon and then returns to it, and\nis heated over again, incessantly.\n\n\"Now, the cases increase 1/480 of their volume for each degree of heat\napplied. If, then, I force the temperature 18 degrees, the hydrogen of\nthe balloon will dilate 18/480 or 1614 cubic feet, and will, therefore,\ndisplace 1614 more cubic feet of air, which will increase its\nascensional power by 160 pounds. This is equivalent to throwing out that\nweight of ballast. If I augment the temperature by 180 degrees, the gas\nwill dilate 180/480 and will displace 16,740 cubic feet more, and its\nascensional force will be augmented by 1,600 pounds.\n\n\"Thus, you see, gentlemen, that I can easily effect very considerable\nchanges of equilibrium. The volume of the balloon has been calculated\nin such manner that, when half inflated, it displaces a weight of air\nexactly equal to that of the envelope containing the hydrogen gas,\nand of the car occupied by the passengers, and all its apparatus and\naccessories. At this point of inflation, it is in exact equilibrium with\nthe air, and neither mounts nor descends.\n\n\"In order, then, to effect an ascent, I give the gas a temperature\nsuperior to the temperature of the surrounding air by means of my\ncylinder. By this excess of heat it obtains a larger distention, and\ninflates the balloon more. The latter, then, ascends in proportion as I\nheat the hydrogen.\n\n\"The descent, of course, is effected by lowering the heat of the\ncylinder, and letting the temperature abate. The ascent would\nbe, usually, more rapid than the descent; but that is a fortunate\ncircumstance, since it is of no importance to me to descend rapidly,\nwhile, on the other hand, it is by a very rapid ascent that I avoid\nobstacles. The real danger lurks below, and not above.\n\n\"Besides, as I have said, I have a certain quantity of ballast, which\nwill enable me to ascend more rapidly still, when necessary. My valve,\nat the top of the balloon, is nothing more nor less than a safety-valve.\nThe balloon always retains the same quantity of hydrogen, and the\nvariations of temperature that I produce in the midst of this shut-up\ngas are, of themselves, sufficient to provide for all these ascending\nand descending movements.\n\n\"Now, gentlemen, as a practical detail, let me add this:\n\n\"The combustion of the hydrogen and of the oxygen at the point of the\ncylinder produces solely the vapor or steam of water. I have, therefore,\nprovided the lower part of the cylindrical iron box with a scape-pipe,\nwith a valve operating by means of a pressure of two atmospheres;\nconsequently, so soon as this amount of pressure is attained, the steam\nescapes of itself.\n\n\"Here are the exact figures: 25 gallons of water, separated into its\nconstituent elements, yield 200 pounds of oxygen and 25 pounds of\nhydrogen. This represents, at atmospheric tension, 1,800 cubic feet of\nthe former and 3,780 cubic feet of the latter, or 5,670 cubic feet,\nin all, of the mixture. Hence, the stopcock of my cylinder, when fully\nopen, expends 27 cubic feet per hour, with a flame at least six times\nas strong as that of the large lamps used for lighting streets. On an\naverage, then, and in order to keep myself at a very moderate elevation,\nI should not burn more than nine cubic feet per hour, so that my\ntwenty-five gallons of water represent six hundred and thirty-six hours\nof aerial navigation, or a little more than twenty-six days.\n\n\"Well, as I can descend when I please, to replenish my stock of water on\nthe way, my trip might be indefinitely prolonged.\n\n\"Such, gentlemen, is my secret. It is simple, and, like most simple\nthings, it cannot fail to succeed. The dilation and contraction of the\ngas in the balloon is my means of locomotion, which calls for neither\ncumbersome wings, nor any other mechanical motor. A calorifere to\nproduce the changes of temperature, and a cylinder to generate the heat,\nare neither inconvenient nor heavy. I think, therefore, that I have\ncombined all the elements of success.\"\n\nDr. Ferguson here terminated his discourse, and was most heartily\napplauded. There was not an objection to make to it; all had been\nforeseen and decided.\n\n\"However,\" said the captain, \"the thing may prove dangerous.\"\n\n\"What matters that,\" replied the doctor, \"provided that it be\npracticable?\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ELEVENTH.\n\nThe Arrival at Zanzibar.--The English Consul.--Ill-will of the\nInhabitants.--The Island of Koumbeni.--The Rain-Makers.--Inflation of\nthe Balloon.--Departure on the 18th of April.--The last Good-by.--The\nVictoria.\n\nAn invariably favorable wind had accelerated the progress of the\nResolute toward the place of her destination. The navigation of the\nMozambique Channel was especially calm and pleasant. The agreeable\ncharacter of the trip by sea was regarded as a good omen of the probable\nissue of the trip through the air. Every one looked forward to the\nhour of arrival, and sought to give the last touch to the doctor's\npreparations.\n\nAt length the vessel hove in sight of the town of Zanzibar, upon the\nisland of the same name, and, on the 15th of April, at 11 o'clock in the\nmorning, she anchored in the port.\n\nThe island of Zanzibar belongs to the Imaum of Muscat, an ally of France\nand England, and is, undoubtedly, his finest settlement. The port is\nfrequented by a great many vessels from the neighboring countries.\n\nThe island is separated from the African coast only by a channel, the\ngreatest width of which is but thirty miles.\n\nIt has a large trade in gums, ivory, and, above all, in \"ebony,\" for\nZanzibar is the great slave-market. Thither converges all the booty\ncaptured in the battles which the chiefs of the interior are continually\nfighting. This traffic extends along the whole eastern coast, and as far\nas the Nile latitudes. Mr. G. Lejean even reports that he has seen it\ncarried on, openly, under the French flag.\n\nUpon the arrival of the Resolute, the English consul at Zanzibar came\non board to offer his services to the doctor, of whose projects the\nEuropean newspapers had made him aware for a month past. But, up to that\nmoment, he had remained with the numerous phalanx of the incredulous.\n\n\"I doubted,\" said he, holding out his hand to Dr. Ferguson, \"but now I\ndoubt no longer.\"\n\nHe invited the doctor, Kennedy, and the faithful Joe, of course, to\nhis own dwelling. Through his courtesy, the doctor was enabled to have\nknowledge of the various letters that he had received from Captain\nSpeke. The captain and his companions had suffered dreadfully from\nhunger and bad weather before reaching the Ugogo country. They could\nadvance only with extreme difficulty, and did not expect to be able to\ncommunicate again for a long time.\n\n\"Those are perils and privations which we shall manage to avoid,\" said\nthe doctor.\n\nThe baggage of the three travellers was conveyed to the consul's\nresidence. Arrangements were made for disembarking the balloon upon the\nbeach at Zanzibar. There was a convenient spot, near the signal-mast,\nclose by an immense building, that would serve to shelter it from the\neast winds. This huge tower, resembling a tun standing on one end,\nbeside which the famous Heidelberg tun would have seemed but a very\nordinary barrel, served as a fortification, and on its platform were\nstationed Belootchees, armed with lances. These Belootchees are a kind\nof brawling, good-for-nothing Janizaries.\n\nBut, when about to land the balloon, the consul was informed that the\npopulation of the island would oppose their doing so by force.\nNothing is so blind as fanatical passion. The news of the arrival of a\nChristian, who was to ascend into the air, was received with rage. The\nnegroes, more exasperated than the Arabs, saw in this project an attack\nupon their religion. They took it into their heads that some mischief\nwas meant to the sun and the moon. Now, these two luminaries are objects\nof veneration to the African tribes, and they determined to oppose so\nsacrilegious an enterprise.\n\nThe consul, informed of their intentions, conferred with Dr. Ferguson\nand Captain Bennet on the subject. The latter was unwilling to yield\nto threats, but his friend dissuaded him from any idea of violent\nretaliation.\n\n\"We shall certainly come out winners,\" he said. \"Even the imaum's\nsoldiers will lend us a hand, if we need it. But, my dear captain, an\naccident may happen in a moment, and it would require but one unlucky\nblow to do the balloon an irreparable injury, so that the trip would be\ntotally defeated; therefore we must act with the greatest caution.\"\n\n\"But what are we to do? If we land on the coast of Africa, we shall\nencounter the same difficulties. What are we to do?\"\n\n\"Nothing is more simple,\" replied the consul. \"You observe those small\nislands outside of the port; land your balloon on one of them; surround\nit with a guard of sailors, and you will have no risk to run.\"\n\n\"Just the thing!\" said the doctor, \"and we shall be entirely at our ease\nin completing our preparations.\"\n\nThe captain yielded to these suggestions, and the Resolute was headed\nfor the island of Koumbeni. During the morning of the 16th April, the\nballoon was placed in safety in the middle of a clearing in the great\nwoods, with which the soil is studded.\n\nTwo masts, eighty feet in height, were raised at the same distance from\neach other. Blocks and tackle, placed at their extremities, afforded the\nmeans of elevating the balloon, by the aid of a transverse rope. It\nwas then entirely uninflated. The interior balloon was fastened to the\nexterior one, in such manner as to be lifted up in the same way. To the\nlower end of each balloon were fixed the pipes that served to introduce\nthe hydrogen gas.\n\nThe whole day, on the 17th, was spent in arranging the apparatus\ndestined to produce the gas; it consisted of some thirty casks, in which\nthe decomposition of water was effected by means of iron-filings and\nsulphuric acid placed together in a large quantity of the first-named\nfluid. The hydrogen passed into a huge central cask, after having been\nwashed on the way, and thence into each balloon by the conduit-pipes.\nIn this manner each of them received a certain accurately-ascertained\nquantity of gas. For this purpose, there had to be employed eighteen\nhundred and sixty-six pounds of sulphuric acid, sixteen thousand and\nfifty pounds of iron, and nine thousand one hundred and sixty-six\ngallons of water. This operation commenced on the following night, about\nthree A.M., and lasted nearly eight hours. The next day, the balloon,\ncovered with its network, undulated gracefully above its car, which was\nheld to the ground by numerous sacks of earth. The inflating apparatus\nwas put together with extreme care, and the pipes issuing from the\nballoon were securely fitted to the cylindrical case.\n\nThe anchors, the cordage, the instruments, the travelling-wraps, the\nawning, the provisions, and the arms, were put in the place assigned to\nthem in the car. The supply of water was procured at Zanzibar. The two\nhundred pounds of ballast were distributed in fifty bags placed at the\nbottom of the car, but within arm's-reach.\n\nThese preparations were concluded about five o'clock in the evening,\nwhile sentinels kept close watch around the island, and the boats of the\nResolute patrolled the channel.\n\nThe blacks continued to show their displeasure by grimaces and\ncontortions. Their obi-men, or wizards, went up and down among the angry\nthrongs, pouring fuel on the flame of their fanaticism; and some of the\nexcited wretches, more furious and daring than the rest, attempted to\nget to the island by swimming, but they were easily driven off.\n\nThereupon the sorceries and incantations commenced; the \"rain-makers,\"\nwho pretend to have control over the clouds, invoked the storms and the\n\"stone-showers,\" as the blacks call hail, to their aid. To compel them\nto do so, they plucked leaves of all the different trees that grow in\nthat country, and boiled them over a slow fire, while, at the same time,\na sheep was killed by thrusting a long needle into its heart. But, in\nspite of all their ceremonies, the sky remained clear and beautiful,\nand they profited nothing by their slaughtered sheep and their ugly\ngrimaces.\n\nThe blacks then abandoned themselves to the most furious orgies, and\ngot fearfully drunk on \"tembo,\" a kind of ardent spirits drawn from\nthe cocoa-nut tree, and an extremely heady sort of beer called \"togwa.\"\nTheir chants, which were destitute of all melody, but were sung in\nexcellent time, continued until far into the night.\n\nAbout six o'clock in the evening, the captain assembled the travellers\nand the officers of the ship at a farewell repast in his cabin. Kennedy,\nwhom nobody ventured to question now, sat with his eyes riveted on Dr.\nFerguson, murmuring indistinguishable words. In other respects, the\ndinner was a gloomy one. The approach of the final moment filled\neverybody with the most serious reflections. What had fate in store for\nthese daring adventurers? Should they ever again find themselves in the\nmidst of their friends, or seated at the domestic hearth? Were their\ntravelling apparatus to fail, what would become of them, among those\nferocious savage tribes, in regions that had never been explored, and in\nthe midst of boundless deserts?\n\nSuch thoughts as these, which had been dim and vague until then, or but\nslightly regarded when they came up, returned upon their excited fancies\nwith intense force at this parting moment. Dr. Ferguson, still cold and\nimpassible, talked of this, that, and the other; but he strove in vain\nto overcome this infectious gloominess. He utterly failed.\n\nAs some demonstration against the personal safety of the doctor and his\ncompanions was feared, all three slept that night on board the Resolute.\nAt six o'clock in the morning they left their cabin, and landed on the\nisland of Koumbeni.\n\nThe balloon was swaying gently to and fro in the morning breeze;\nthe sand-bags that had held it down were now replaced by some twenty\nstrong-armed sailors, and Captain Bennet and his officers were present\nto witness the solemn departure of their friends.\n\nAt this moment Kennedy went right up to the doctor, grasped his hand,\nand said:\n\n\"Samuel, have you absolutely determined to go?\"\n\n\"Solemnly determined, my dear Dick.\"\n\n\"I have done every thing that I could to prevent this expedition, have I\nnot?\"\n\n\"Every thing!\"\n\n\"Well, then, my conscience is clear on that score, and I will go with\nyou.\"\n\n\"I was sure you would!\" said the doctor, betraying in his features swift\ntraces of emotion.\n\nAt last the moment of final leave-taking arrived. The captain and\nhis officers embraced their dauntless friends with great feeling, not\nexcepting even Joe, who, worthy fellow, was as proud and happy as a\nprince. Every one in the party insisted upon having a final shake of the\ndoctor's hand.\n\nAt nine o'clock the three travellers got into their car. The doctor lit\nthe combustible in his cylinder and turned the flame so as to produce a\nrapid heat, and the balloon, which had rested on the ground in perfect\nequipoise, began to rise in a few minutes, so that the seamen had to\nslacken the ropes they held it by. The car then rose about twenty feet\nabove their heads.\n\n\"My friends!\" exclaimed the doctor, standing up between his two\ncompanions, and taking off his hat, \"let us give our aerial ship a name\nthat will bring her good luck! let us christen her Victoria!\"\n\nThis speech was answered with stentorian cheers of \"Huzza for the Queen!\nHuzza for Old England!\"\n\nAt this moment the ascensional force of the balloon increased\nprodigiously, and Ferguson, Kennedy, and Joe, waved a last good-by to\ntheir friends.\n\n\"Let go all!\" shouted the doctor, and at the word the Victoria shot\nrapidly up into the sky, while the four carronades on board the Resolute\nthundered forth a parting salute in her honor.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWELFTH\n\nCrossing the Strait.--The Mrima.--Dick's Remark and Joe's\nProposition.--A Recipe for Coffee-making.--The Uzaramo.--The Unfortunate\nMaizan.--Mount Dathumi.--The Doctor's Cards.--Night under a Nopal.\n\nThe air was pure, the wind moderate, and the balloon ascended almost\nperpendicularly to a height of fifteen hundred feet, as indicated by a\ndepression of two inches in the barometric column.\n\nAt this height a more decided current carried the balloon toward the\nsouthwest. What a magnificent spectacle was then outspread beneath the\ngaze of the travellers! The island of Zanzibar could be seen in its\nentire extent, marked out by its deeper color upon a vast planisphere;\nthe fields had the appearance of patterns of different colors, and thick\nclumps of green indicated the groves and thickets.\n\nThe inhabitants of the island looked no larger than insects. The\nhuzzaing and shouting were little by little lost in the distance, and\nonly the discharge of the ship's guns could be heard in the concavity\nbeneath the balloon, as the latter sped on its flight.\n\n\"How fine that is!\" said Joe, breaking silence for the first time.\n\nHe got no reply. The doctor was busy observing the variations of the\nbarometer and noting down the details of his ascent.\n\nKennedy looked on, and had not eyes enough to take in all that he saw.\n\nThe rays of the sun coming to the aid of the heating cylinder, the\ntension of the gas increased, and the Victoria attained the height of\ntwenty-five hundred feet.\n\nThe Resolute looked like a mere cockle-shell, and the African coast\ncould be distinctly seen in the west marked out by a fringe of foam.\n\n\"You don't talk?\" said Joe, again.\n\n\"We are looking!\" said the doctor, directing his spy-glass toward the\nmainland.\n\n\"For my part, I must talk!\"\n\n\"As much as you please, Joe; talk as much as you like!\"\n\nAnd Joe went on alone with a tremendous volley of exclamations. The\n\"ohs!\" and the \"ahs!\" exploded one after the other, incessantly, from\nhis lips.\n\nDuring his passage over the sea the doctor deemed it best to keep at his\npresent elevation. He could thus reconnoitre a greater stretch of the\ncoast. The thermometer and the barometer, hanging up inside of the\nhalf-opened awning, were always within sight, and a second barometer\nsuspended outside was to serve during the night watches.\n\nAt the end of about two hours the Victoria, driven along at a speed of\na little more than eight miles, very visibly neared the coast of the\nmainland. The doctor, thereupon, determined to descend a little nearer\nto the ground. So he moderated the flame of his cylinder, and the\nballoon, in a few moments, had descended to an altitude only three\nhundred feet above the soil.\n\nIt was then found to be passing just over the Mrima country, the name of\nthis part of the eastern coast of Africa. Dense borders of mango-trees\nprotected its margin, and the ebb-tide disclosed to view their thick\nroots, chafed and gnawed by the teeth of the Indian Ocean. The sands\nwhich, at an earlier period, formed the coast-line, rounded away along\nthe distant horizon, and Mount Nguru reared aloft its sharp summit in\nthe northwest.\n\nThe Victoria passed near to a village which the doctor found marked upon\nhis chart as Kaole. Its entire population had assembled in crowds, and\nwere yelling with anger and fear, at the same time vainly directing\ntheir arrows against this monster of the air that swept along so\nmajestically away above all their powerless fury.\n\nThe wind was setting to the southward, but the doctor felt no concern on\nthat score, since it enabled him the better to follow the route traced\nby Captains Burton and Speke.\n\nKennedy had, at length, become as talkative as Joe, and the two kept up\na continual interchange of admiring interjections and exclamations.\n\n\"Out upon stage-coaches!\" said one.\n\n\"Steamers indeed!\" said the other.\n\n\"Railroads! eh? rubbish!\" put in Kennedy, \"that you travel on, without\nseeing the country!\"\n\n\"Balloons! they're the sort for me!\" Joe would add. \"Why, you don't\nfeel yourself going, and Nature takes the trouble to spread herself out\nbefore one's eyes!\"\n\n\"What a splendid sight! What a spectacle! What a delight! a dream in a\nhammock!\"\n\n\"Suppose we take our breakfast?\" was Joe's unpoetical change of tune, at\nlast, for the keen, open air had mightily sharpened his appetite.\n\n\"Good idea, my boy!\"\n\n\"Oh! it won't take us long to do the cooking--biscuit and potted meat?\"\n\n\"And as much coffee as you like,\" said the doctor. \"I give you leave to\nborrow a little heat from my cylinder. There's enough and to spare, for\nthat matter, and so we shall avoid the risk of a conflagration.\"\n\n\"That would be a dreadful misfortune!\" ejaculated Kennedy. \"It's the\nsame as a powder-magazine suspended over our heads.\"\n\n\"Not precisely,\" said Ferguson, \"but still if the gas were to take fire\nit would burn up gradually, and we should settle down on the ground,\nwhich would be disagreeable; but never fear--our balloon is hermetically\nsealed.\"\n\n\"Let us eat a bite, then,\" replied Kennedy.\n\n\"Now, gentlemen,\" put in Joe, \"while doing the same as you, I'm going\nto get you up a cup of coffee that I think you'll have something to say\nabout.\"\n\n\"The fact is,\" added the doctor, \"that Joe, along with a thousand other\nvirtues, has a remarkable talent for the preparation of that delicious\nbeverage: he compounds it of a mixture of various origin, but he never\nwould reveal to me the ingredients.\"\n\n\"Well, master, since we are so far above-ground, I can tell you the\nsecret. It is just to mix equal quantities of Mocha, of Bourbon coffee,\nand of Rio Nunez.\"\n\nA few moments later, three steaming cups of coffee were served, and\ntopped off a substantial breakfast, which was additionally seasoned by\nthe jokes and repartees of the guests. Each one then resumed his post of\nobservation.\n\nThe country over which they were passing was remarkable for its\nfertility. Narrow, winding paths plunged in beneath the overarching\nverdure. They swept along above cultivated fields of tobacco, maize, and\nbarley, at full maturity, and here and there immense rice-fields, full\nof straight stalks and purple blossoms. They could distinguish sheep and\ngoats too, confined in large cages, set up on piles to keep them out\nof reach of the leopards' fangs. Luxuriant vegetation spread in wild\nprofuseness over this prodigal soil.\n\nVillage after village rang with yells of terror and astonishment at the\nsight of the Victoria, and Dr. Ferguson prudently kept her above the\nreach of the barbarian arrows. The savages below, thus baffled, ran\ntogether from their huddle of huts and followed the travellers with\ntheir vain imprecations while they remained in sight.\n\nAt noon, the doctor, upon consulting his map, calculated that they were\npassing over the Uzaramo* country. The soil was thickly studded with\ncocoa-nut, papaw, and cotton-wood trees, above which the balloon seemed\nto disport itself like a bird. Joe found this splendid vegetation a\nmatter of course, seeing that they were in Africa. Kennedy descried some\nhares and quails that asked nothing better than to get a good shot from\nhis fowling-piece, but it would have been powder wasted, since there was\nno time to pick up the game.\n\n     * U and Ou signify country in the language of that region.\n\nThe aeronauts swept on with the speed of twelve miles per hour, and soon\nwere passing in thirty-eight degrees twenty minutes east longitude, over\nthe village of Tounda.\n\n\"It was there,\" said the doctor, \"that Burton and Speke were seized with\nviolent fevers, and for a moment thought their expedition ruined. And\nyet they were only a short distance from the coast, but fatigue and\nprivation were beginning to tell upon them severely.\"\n\nIn fact, there is a perpetual malaria reigning throughout the country\nin question. Even the doctor could hope to escape its effects only by\nrising above the range of the miasma that exhales from this damp region\nwhence the blazing rays of the sun pump up its poisonous vapors. Once in\na while they could descry a caravan resting in a \"kraal,\" awaiting the\nfreshness and cool of the evening to resume its route. These kraals are\nwide patches of cleared land, surrounded by hedges and jungles, where\ntraders take shelter against not only the wild beasts, but also the\nrobber tribes of the country. They could see the natives running and\nscattering in all directions at the sight of the Victoria. Kennedy was\nkeen to get a closer look at them, but the doctor invariably held out\nagainst the idea.\n\n\"The chiefs are armed with muskets,\" he said, \"and our balloon would be\ntoo conspicuous a mark for their bullets.\"\n\n\"Would a bullet-hole bring us down?\" asked Joe.\n\n\"Not immediately; but such a hole would soon become a large torn orifice\nthrough which our gas would escape.\"\n\n\"Then, let us keep at a respectful distance from yon miscreants. What\nmust they think as they see us sailing in the air? I'm sure they must\nfeel like worshipping us!\"\n\n\"Let them worship away, then,\" replied the doctor, \"but at a distance.\nThere is no harm done in getting as far away from them as possible. See!\nthe country is already changing its aspect: the villages are fewer and\nfarther between; the mango-trees have disappeared, for their growth\nceases at this latitude. The soil is becoming hilly and portends\nmountains not far off.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Kennedy, \"it seems to me that I can see some high land on\nthis side.\"\n\n\"In the west--those are the nearest ranges of the Ourizara--Mount\nDuthumi, no doubt, behind which I hope to find shelter for the night.\nI'll stir up the heat in the cylinder a little, for we must keep at an\nelevation of five or six hundred feet.\"\n\n\"That was a grant idea of yours, sir,\" said Joe. \"It's mighty easy to\nmanage it; you turn a cock, and the thing's done.\"\n\n\"Ah! here we are more at our ease,\" said the sportsman, as the balloon\nascended; \"the reflection of the sun on those red sands was getting to\nbe insupportable.\"\n\n\"What splendid trees!\" cried Joe. \"They're quite natural, but they are\nvery fine! Why a dozen of them would make a forest!\"\n\n\"Those are baobabs,\" replied Dr. Ferguson. \"See, there's one with a\ntrunk fully one hundred feet in circumference. It was, perhaps, at the\nfoot of that very tree that Maizan, the French traveller, expired in\n1845, for we are over the village of Deje-la-Mhora, to which he pushed\non alone. He was seized by the chief of this region, fastened to the\nfoot of a baobab, and the ferocious black then severed all his joints\nwhile the war-song of his tribe was chanted; he then made a gash in the\nprisoner's neck, stopped to sharpen his knife, and fairly tore away the\npoor wretch's head before it had been cut from the body. The unfortunate\nFrenchman was but twenty-six years of age.\"\n\n\"And France has never avenged so hideous a crime?\" said Kennedy.\n\n\"France did demand satisfaction, and the Said of Zanzibar did all in his\npower to capture the murderer, but in vain.\"\n\n\"I move that we don't stop here!\" urged Joe; \"let us go up, master, let\nus go up higher by all means.\"\n\n\"All the more willingly, Joe, that there is Mount Duthumi right ahead\nof us. If my calculations be right we shall have passed it before seven\no'clock in the evening.\"\n\n\"Shall we not travel at night?\" asked the Scotchman.\n\n\"No, as little as possible. With care and vigilance we might do so\nsafely, but it is not enough to sweep across Africa. We want to see it.\"\n\n\"Up to this time we have nothing to complain of, master. The best\ncultivated and most fertile country in the world instead of a desert!\nBelieve the geographers after that!\"\n\n\"Let us wait, Joe! we shall see by-and-by.\"\n\nAbout half-past six in the evening the Victoria was directly opposite\nMount Duthumi; in order to pass, it had to ascend to a height of more\nthan three thousand feet, and to accomplish that the doctor had only to\nraise the temperature of his gas eighteen degrees. It might have been\ncorrectly said that he held his balloon in his hand. Kennedy had only\nto indicate to him the obstacles to be surmounted, and the Victoria sped\nthrough the air, skimming the summits of the range.\n\nAt eight o'clock it descended the farther slope, the acclivity of which\nwas much less abrupt. The anchors were thrown out from the car and\none of them, coming in contact with the branches of an enormous nopal,\ncaught on it firmly. Joe at once let himself slide down the rope and\nsecured it. The silk ladder was then lowered to him and he remounted\nto the car with agility. The balloon now remained perfectly at rest\nsheltered from the eastern winds.\n\nThe evening meal was got ready, and the aeronauts, excited by their\nday's journey, made a heavy onslaught upon the provisions.\n\n\"What distance have we traversed to-day?\" asked Kennedy, disposing of\nsome alarming mouthfuls.\n\nThe doctor took his bearings, by means of lunar observations, and\nconsulted the excellent map that he had with him for his guidance. It\nbelonged to the Atlas of \"Der Neuester Endeckungen in Afrika\" (\"The\nLatest Discoveries in Africa\"), published at Gotha by his learned friend\nDr. Petermann, and by that savant sent to him. This Atlas was to serve\nthe doctor on his whole journey; for it contained the itinerary of\nBurton and Speke to the great lakes; the Soudan, according to Dr. Barth;\nthe Lower Senegal, according to Guillaume Lejean; and the Delta of the\nNiger, by Dr. Blaikie.\n\nFerguson had also provided himself with a work which combined in one\ncompilation all the notions already acquired concerning the Nile. It was\nentitled \"The Sources of the Nile; being a General Survey of the Basin\nof that River and of its Head-Stream, with the History of the Nilotic\nDiscovery, by Charles Beke, D.D.\"\n\nHe also had the excellent charts published in the \"Bulletins of the\nGeographical Society of London;\" and not a single point of the countries\nalready discovered could, therefore, escape his notice.\n\nUpon tracing on his maps, he found that his latitudinal route had been\ntwo degrees, or one hundred and twenty miles, to the westward.\n\nKennedy remarked that the route tended toward the south; but this\ndirection was satisfactory to the doctor, who desired to reconnoitre the\ntracks of his predecessors as much as possible. It was agreed that the\nnight should be divided into three watches, so that each of the party\nshould take his turn in watching over the safety of the rest. The doctor\ntook the watch commencing at nine o'clock; Kennedy, the one commencing\nat midnight; and Joe, the three o'clock morning watch.\n\nSo Kennedy and Joe, well wrapped in their blankets, stretched themselves\nat full length under the awning, and slept quietly; while Dr. Ferguson\nkept on the lookout.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTEENTH.\n\nChange of Weather.--Kennedy has the Fever.--The Doctor's\nMedicine.--Travels on Land.--The Basin of Imenge.--Mount Rubeho.--Six\nThousand Feet Elevation.--A Halt in the Daytime.\n\nThe night was calm. However, on Saturday morning, Kennedy, as he awoke,\ncomplained of lassitude and feverish chills. The weather was changing.\nThe sky, covered with clouds, seemed to be laying in supplies for a\nfresh deluge. A gloomy region is that Zungomoro country, where it rains\ncontinually, excepting, perhaps, for a couple of weeks in the month of\nJanuary.\n\nA violent shower was not long in drenching our travellers. Below them,\nthe roads, intersected by \"nullahs,\" a sort of instantaneous torrent,\nwere soon rendered impracticable, entangled as they were, besides, with\nthorny thickets and gigantic lianas, or creeping vines. The sulphuretted\nhydrogen emanations, which Captain Burton mentions, could be distinctly\nsmelt.\n\n\"According to his statement, and I think he's right,\" said the doctor,\n\"one could readily believe that there is a corpse hidden behind every\nthicket.\"\n\n\"An ugly country this!\" sighed Joe; \"and it seems to me that Mr. Kennedy\nis none the better for having passed the night in it.\"\n\n\"To tell the truth, I have quite a high fever,\" said the sportsman.\n\n\"There's nothing remarkable about that, my dear Dick, for we are in one\nof the most unhealthy regions in Africa; but we shall not remain here\nlong; so let's be off.\"\n\nThanks to a skilful manoeuvre achieved by Joe, the anchor was\ndisengaged, and Joe reascended to the car by means of the ladder. The\ndoctor vigorously dilated the gas, and the Victoria resumed her flight,\ndriven along by a spanking breeze.\n\nOnly a few scattered huts could be seen through the pestilential mists;\nbut the appearance of the country soon changed, for it often happens in\nAfrica that some of the unhealthiest districts lie close beside others\nthat are perfectly salubrious.\n\nKennedy was visibly suffering, and the fever was mastering his vigorous\nconstitution.\n\n\"It won't do to fall ill, though,\" he grumbled; and so saying, he\nwrapped himself in a blanket, and lay down under the awning.\n\n\"A little patience, Dick, and you'll soon get over this,\" said the\ndoctor.\n\n\"Get over it! Egad, Samuel, if you've any drug in your travelling-chest\nthat will set me on my feet again, bring it without delay. I'll swallow\nit with my eyes shut!\"\n\n\"Oh, I can do better than that, friend Dick; for I can give you a\nfebrifuge that won't cost any thing.\"\n\n\"And how will you do that?\"\n\n\"Very easily. I am simply going to take you up above these clouds that\nare now deluging us, and remove you from this pestilential atmosphere. I\nask for only ten minutes, in order to dilate the hydrogen.\"\n\nThe ten minutes had scarcely elapsed ere the travellers were beyond the\nrainy belt of country.\n\n\"Wait a little, now, Dick, and you'll begin to feel the effect of pure\nair and sunshine.\"\n\n\"There's a cure for you!\" said Joe; \"why, it's wonderful!\"\n\n\"No, it's merely natural.\"\n\n\"Oh! natural; yes, no doubt of that!\"\n\n\"I bring Dick into good air, as the doctors do, every day, in Europe,\nor, as I would send a patient at Martinique to the Pitons, a lofty\nmountain on that island, to get clear of the yellow fever.\"\n\n\"Ah! by Jove, this balloon is a paradise!\" exclaimed Kennedy, feeling\nmuch better already.\n\n\"It leads to it, anyhow!\" replied Joe, quite gravely.\n\nIt was a curious spectacle--that mass of clouds piled up, at the moment,\naway below them! The vapors rolled over each other, and mingled together\nin confused masses of superb brilliance, as they reflected the rays of\nthe sun. The Victoria had attained an altitude of four thousand feet,\nand the thermometer indicated a certain diminution of temperature. The\nland below could no longer be seen. Fifty miles away to the westward,\nMount Rubeho raised its sparkling crest, marking the limit of the Ugogo\ncountry in east longitude thirty-six degrees twenty minutes. The wind\nwas blowing at the rate of twenty miles an hour, but the aeronauts felt\nnothing of this increased speed. They observed no jar, and had scarcely\nany sense of motion at all.\n\nThree hours later, the doctor's prediction was fully verified. Kennedy\nno longer felt a single shiver of the fever, but partook of some\nbreakfast with an excellent appetite.\n\n\"That beats sulphate of quinine!\" said the energetic Scot, with hearty\nemphasis and much satisfaction.\n\n\"Positively,\" said Joe, \"this is where I'll have to retire to when I get\nold!\"\n\nAbout ten o'clock in the morning the atmosphere cleared up, the clouds\nparted, and the country beneath could again be seen, the Victoria\nmeanwhile rapidly descending. Dr. Ferguson was in search of a current\nthat would carry him more to the northeast, and he found it about six\nhundred feet from the ground. The country was becoming more broken, and\neven mountainous. The Zungomoro district was fading out of sight in the\neast with the last cocoa-nut-trees of that latitude.\n\nEre long, the crests of a mountain-range assumed a more decided\nprominence. A few peaks rose here and there, and it became necessary\nto keep a sharp lookout for the pointed cones that seemed to spring up\nevery moment.\n\n\"We're right among the breakers!\" said Kennedy.\n\n\"Keep cool, Dick. We shan't touch them,\" was the doctor's quiet answer.\n\n\"It's a jolly way to travel, anyhow!\" said Joe, with his usual flow of\nspirits.\n\nIn fact, the doctor managed his balloon with wondrous dexterity.\n\n\"Now, if we had been compelled to go afoot over that drenched soil,\"\nsaid he, \"we should still be dragging along in a pestilential mire.\nSince our departure from Zanzibar, half our beasts of burden would\nhave died with fatigue. We should be looking like ghosts ourselves,\nand despair would be seizing on our hearts. We should be in continual\nsquabbles with our guides and porters, and completely exposed to\ntheir unbridled brutality. During the daytime, a damp, penetrating,\nunendurable humidity! At night, a cold frequently intolerable, and\nthe stings of a kind of fly whose bite pierces the thickest cloth, and\ndrives the victim crazy! All this, too, without saying any thing about\nwild beasts and ferocious native tribes!\"\n\n\"I move that we don't try it!\" said Joe, in his droll way.\n\n\"I exaggerate nothing,\" continued Ferguson, \"for, upon reading the\nnarratives of such travellers as have had the hardihood to venture into\nthese regions, your eyes would fill with tears.\"\n\nAbout eleven o'clock they were passing over the basin of Imenge, and the\ntribes scattered over the adjacent hills were impotently menacing the\nVictoria with their weapons. Finally, she sped along as far as the last\nundulations of the country which precede Rubeho. These form the last and\nloftiest chain of the mountains of Usagara.\n\nThe aeronauts took careful and complete note of the orographic\nconformation of the country. The three ramifications mentioned, of which\nthe Duthumi forms the first link, are separated by immense longitudinal\nplains. These elevated summits consist of rounded cones, between which\nthe soil is bestrewn with erratic blocks of stone and gravelly bowlders.\nThe most abrupt declivity of these mountains confronts the Zanzibar\ncoast, but the western slopes are merely inclined planes. The\ndepressions in the soil are covered with a black, rich loam, on which\nthere is a vigorous vegetation. Various water-courses filter through,\ntoward the east, and work their way onward to flow into the Kingani,\nin the midst of gigantic clumps of sycamore, tamarind, calabash, and\npalmyra trees.\n\n\"Attention!\" said Dr. Ferguson. \"We are approaching Rubeho, the name\nof which signifies, in the language of the country, the 'Passage of the\nWinds,' and we would do well to double its jagged pinnacles at a certain\nheight. If my chart be exact, we are going to ascend to an elevation of\nfive thousand feet.\"\n\n\"Shall we often have occasion to reach those far upper belts of the\natmosphere?\"\n\n\"Very seldom: the height of the African mountains appears to be quite\nmoderate compared with that of the European and Asiatic ranges; but,\nin any case, our good Victoria will find no difficulty in passing over\nthem.\"\n\nIn a very little while, the gas expanded under the action of the heat,\nand the balloon took a very decided ascensional movement. Besides, the\ndilation of the hydrogen involved no danger, and only three-fourths of\nthe vast capacity of the balloon was filled when the barometer, by a\ndepression of eight inches, announced an elevation of six thousand feet.\n\n\"Shall we go this high very long?\" asked Joe.\n\n\"The atmosphere of the earth has a height of six thousand fathoms,\" said\nthe doctor; \"and, with a very large balloon, one might go far. That is\nwhat Messrs. Brioschi and Gay-Lussac did; but then the blood burst from\ntheir mouths and ears. Respirable air was wanting. Some years ago, two\nfearless Frenchmen, Messrs. Barral and Bixio, also ventured into the\nvery lofty regions; but their balloon burst--\"\n\n\"And they fell?\" asked Kennedy, abruptly.\n\n\"Certainly they did; but as learned men should always fall--namely,\nwithout hurting themselves.\"\n\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" said Joe, \"you may try their fall over again, if you\nlike; but, as for me, who am but a dolt, I prefer keeping at the medium\nheight--neither too far up, nor too low down. It won't do to be too\nambitious.\"\n\nAt the height of six thousand feet, the density of the atmosphere has\nalready greatly diminished; sound is conveyed with difficulty, and the\nvoice is not so easily heard. The view of objects becomes confused; the\ngaze no longer takes in any but large, quite ill-distinguishable masses;\nmen and animals on the surface become absolutely invisible; the roads\nand rivers get to look like threads, and the lakes dwindle to ponds.\n\nThe doctor and his friends felt themselves in a very anomalous\ncondition; an atmospheric current of extreme velocity was bearing them\naway beyond arid mountains, upon whose summits vast fields of snow\nsurprised the gaze; while their convulsed appearance told of Titanic\ntravail in the earliest epoch of the world's existence.\n\nThe sun shone at the zenith, and his rays fell perpendicularly upon\nthose lonely summits. The doctor took an accurate design of these\nmountains, which form four distinct ridges almost in a straight line,\nthe northernmost being the longest.\n\nThe Victoria soon descended the slope opposite to the Rubeho, skirting\nan acclivity covered with woods, and dotted with trees of very\ndeep-green foliage. Then came crests and ravines, in a sort of desert\nwhich preceded the Ugogo country; and lower down were yellow plains,\nparched and fissured by the intense heat, and, here and there, bestrewn\nwith saline plants and brambly thickets.\n\nSome underbrush, which, farther on, became forests, embellished the\nhorizon. The doctor went nearer to the ground; the anchors were thrown\nout, and one of them soon caught in the boughs of a huge sycamore.\n\nJoe, slipping nimbly down the tree, carefully attached the anchor, and\nthe doctor left his cylinder at work to a certain degree in order to\nretain sufficient ascensional force in the balloon to keep it in the\nair. Meanwhile the wind had suddenly died away.\n\n\"Now,\" said Ferguson, \"take two guns, friend Dick--one for yourself\nand one for Joe--and both of you try to bring back some nice cuts of\nantelope-meat; they will make us a good dinner.\"\n\n\"Off to the hunt!\" exclaimed Kennedy, joyously.\n\nHe climbed briskly out of the car and descended. Joe had swung himself\ndown from branch to branch, and was waiting for him below, stretching\nhis limbs in the mean time.\n\n\"Don't fly away without us, doctor!\" shouted Joe.\n\n\"Never fear, my boy!--I am securely lashed. I'll spend the time getting\nmy notes into shape. A good hunt to you! but be careful. Besides, from\nmy post here, I can observe the face of the country, and, at the least\nsuspicious thing I notice, I'll fire a signal-shot, and with that you\nmust rally home.\"\n\n\"Agreed!\" said Kennedy; and off they went.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOURTEENTH.\n\nThe Forest of Gum-Trees.--The Blue Antelope.--The Rallying-Signal.--An\nUnexpected Attack.--The Kanyeme.--A Night in the Open Air.--The\nMabunguru.--Jihoue-la-Mkoa.--A Supply of Water.--Arrival at Kazeh.\n\nThe country, dry and parched as it was, consisting of a clayey soil that\ncracked open with the heat, seemed, indeed, a desert: here and there\nwere a few traces of caravans; the bones of men and animals, that had\nbeen half-gnawed away, mouldering together in the same dust.\n\nAfter half an hour's walking, Dick and Joe plunged into a forest of\ngum-trees, their eyes alert on all sides, and their fingers on the\ntrigger. There was no foreseeing what they might encounter. Without\nbeing a rifleman, Joe could handle fire-arms with no trifling dexterity.\n\n\"A walk does one good, Mr. Kennedy, but this isn't the easiest ground in\nthe world,\" he said, kicking aside some fragments of quartz with which\nthe soil was bestrewn.\n\nKennedy motioned to his companion to be silent and to halt. The present\ncase compelled them to dispense with hunting-dogs, and, no matter what\nJoe's agility might be, he could not be expected to have the scent of a\nsetter or a greyhound.\n\nA herd of a dozen antelopes were quenching their thirst in the bed of\na torrent where some pools of water had lodged. The graceful creatures,\nsnuffing danger in the breeze, seemed to be disturbed and uneasy. Their\nbeautiful heads could be seen between every draught, raised in the air\nwith quick and sudden motion as they sniffed the wind in the direction\nof our two hunters, with their flexible nostrils.\n\nKennedy stole around behind some clumps of shrubbery, while Joe remained\nmotionless where he was. The former, at length, got within gunshot and\nfired.\n\nThe herd disappeared in the twinkling of an eye; one male antelope\nonly, that was hit just behind the shoulder-joint, fell headlong to the\nground, and Kennedy leaped toward his booty.\n\nIt was a blauwbok, a superb animal of a pale-bluish color shading upon\nthe gray, but with the belly and the inside of the legs as white as the\ndriven snow.\n\n\"A splendid shot!\" exclaimed the hunter. \"It's a very rare species of\nthe antelope, and I hope to be able to prepare his skin in such a way as\nto keep it.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Joe, \"do you think of doing that, Mr. Kennedy?\"\n\n\"Why, certainly I do! Just see what a fine hide it is!\"\n\n\"But Dr. Ferguson will never allow us to take such an extra weight!\"\n\n\"You're right, Joe. Still it is a pity to have to leave such a noble\nanimal.\"\n\n\"The whole of it? Oh, we won't do that, sir; we'll take all the good\neatable parts of it, and, if you'll let me, I'll cut him up just as well\nas the chairman of the honorable corporation of butchers of the city of\nLondon could do.\"\n\n\"As you please, my boy! But you know that in my hunter's way I can just\nas easily skin and cut up a piece of game as kill it.\"\n\n\"I'm sure of that, Mr. Kennedy. Well, then, you can build a fireplace\nwith a few stones; there's plenty of dry dead-wood, and I can make the\nhot coals tell in a few minutes.\"\n\n\"Oh! that won't take long,\" said Kennedy, going to work on the\nfireplace, where he had a brisk flame crackling and sparkling in a\nminute or two.\n\nJoe had cut some of the nicest steaks and the best parts of the\ntenderloin from the carcass of the antelope, and these were quickly\ntransformed to the most savory of broils.\n\n\"There, those will tickle the doctor!\" said Kennedy.\n\n\"Do you know what I was thinking about?\" said Joe.\n\n\"Why, about the steaks you're broiling, to be sure!\" replied Dick.\n\n\"Not the least in the world. I was thinking what a figure we'd cut if we\ncouldn't find the balloon again.\"\n\n\"By George, what an idea! Why, do you think the doctor would desert us?\"\n\n\"No; but suppose his anchor were to slip!\"\n\n\"Impossible! and, besides, the doctor would find no difficulty in coming\ndown again with his balloon; he handles it at his ease.\"\n\n\"But suppose the wind were to sweep it off, so that he couldn't come\nback toward us?\"\n\n\"Come, come, Joe! a truce to your suppositions; they're any thing but\npleasant.\"\n\n\"Ah! sir, every thing that happens in this world is natural, of course;\nbut, then, any thing may happen, and we ought to look out beforehand.\"\n\nAt this moment the report of a gun rang out upon the air.\n\n\"What's that?\" exclaimed Joe.\n\n\"It's my rifle, I know the ring of her!\" said Kennedy.\n\n\"A signal!\"\n\n\"Yes; danger for us!\"\n\n\"For him, too, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Let's be off!\"\n\nAnd the hunters, having gathered up the product of their expedition,\nrapidly made their way back along the path that they had marked by\nbreaking boughs and bushes when they came. The density of the underbrush\nprevented their seeing the balloon, although they could not be far from\nit.\n\nA second shot was heard.\n\n\"We must hurry!\" said Joe.\n\n\"There! a third report!\"\n\n\"Why, it sounds to me as if he was defending himself against something.\"\n\n\"Let us make haste!\"\n\nThey now began to run at the top of their speed. When they reached the\noutskirts of the forest, they, at first glance, saw the balloon in its\nplace and the doctor in the car.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" shouted Kennedy.\n\n\"Good God!\" suddenly exclaimed Joe.\n\n\"What do you see?\"\n\n\"Down there! look! a crowd of blacks surrounding the balloon!\"\n\nAnd, in fact, there, two miles from where they were, they saw some\nthirty wild natives close together, yelling, gesticulating, and cutting\nall kinds of antics at the foot of the sycamore. Some, climbing into the\ntree itself, were making their way to the topmost branches. The danger\nseemed pressing.\n\n\"My master is lost!\" cried Joe.\n\n\"Come! a little more coolness, Joe, and let us see how we stand. We hold\nthe lives of four of those villains in our hands. Forward, then!\"\n\nThey had made a mile with headlong speed, when another report was heard\nfrom the car. The shot had, evidently, told upon a huge black demon, who\nhad been hoisting himself up by the anchor-rope. A lifeless body fell\nfrom bough to bough, and hung about twenty feet from the ground, its\narms and legs swaying to and fro in the air.\n\n\"Ha!\" said Joe, halting, \"what does that fellow hold by?\"\n\n\"No matter what!\" said Kennedy; \"let us run! let us run!\"\n\n\"Ah! Mr. Kennedy,\" said Joe, again, in a roar of laughter, \"by his tail!\nby his tail! it's an ape! They're all apes!\"\n\n\"Well, they're worse than men!\" said Kennedy, as he dashed into the\nmidst of the howling crowd.\n\nIt was, indeed, a troop of very formidable baboons of the dog-faced\nspecies. These creatures are brutal, ferocious, and horrible to look\nupon, with their dog-like muzzles and savage expression. However, a few\nshots scattered them, and the chattering horde scampered off, leaving\nseveral of their number on the ground.\n\nIn a moment Kennedy was on the ladder, and Joe, clambering up the\nbranches, detached the anchor; the car then dipped to where he was, and\nhe got into it without difficulty. A few minutes later, the Victoria\nslowly ascended and soared away to the eastward, wafted by a moderate\nwind.\n\n\"That was an attack for you!\" said Joe.\n\n\"We thought you were surrounded by natives.\"\n\n\"Well, fortunately, they were only apes,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"At a distance there's no great difference,\" remarked Kennedy.\n\n\"Nor close at hand, either,\" added Joe.\n\n\"Well, however that may be,\" resumed Ferguson, \"this attack of apes\nmight have had the most serious consequences. Had the anchor yielded to\ntheir repeated efforts, who knows whither the wind would have carried\nme?\"\n\n\"What did I tell you, Mr. Kennedy?\"\n\n\"You were right, Joe; but, even right as you may have been, you were,\nat that moment, preparing some antelope-steaks, the very sight of which\ngave me a monstrous appetite.\"\n\n\"I believe you!\" said the doctor; \"the flesh of the antelope is\nexquisite.\"\n\n\"You may judge of that yourself, now, sir, for supper's ready.\"\n\n\"Upon my word as a sportsman, those venison-steaks have a gamy flavor\nthat's not to be sneezed at, I tell you.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Joe, with his mouth full, \"I could live on antelope all\nthe days of my life; and all the better with a glass of grog to wash it\ndown.\"\n\nSo saying, the good fellow went to work to prepare a jorum of that\nfragrant beverage, and all hands tasted it with satisfaction.\n\n\"Every thing has gone well thus far,\" said he.\n\n\"Very well indeed!\" assented Kennedy.\n\n\"Come, now, Mr. Kennedy, are you sorry that you came with us?\"\n\n\"I'd like to see anybody prevent my coming!\"\n\nIt was now four o'clock in the afternoon. The Victoria had struck a more\nrapid current. The face of the country was gradually rising, and, ere\nlong, the barometer indicated a height of fifteen hundred feet above the\nlevel of the sea. The doctor was, therefore, obliged to keep his balloon\nup by a quite considerable dilation of gas, and the cylinder was hard at\nwork all the time.\n\nToward seven o'clock, the balloon was sailing over the basin of Kanyeme.\nThe doctor immediately recognized that immense clearing, ten miles in\nextent, with its villages buried in the midst of baobab and calabash\ntrees. It is the residence of one of the sultans of the Ugogo country,\nwhere civilization is, perhaps, the least backward. The natives there\nare less addicted to selling members of their own families, but still,\nmen and animals all live together in round huts, without frames, that\nlook like haystacks.\n\nBeyond Kanyeme the soil becomes arid and stony, but in an hour's\njourney, in a fertile dip of the soil, vegetation had resumed all its\nvigor at some distance from Mdaburu. The wind fell with the close of the\nday, and the atmosphere seemed to sleep. The doctor vainly sought for a\ncurrent of air at different heights, and, at last, seeing this calm\nof all nature, he resolved to pass the night afloat, and, for greater\nsafety, rose to the height of one thousand feet, where the balloon\nremained motionless. The night was magnificent, the heavens glittering\nwith stars, and profoundly silent in the upper air.\n\nDick and Joe stretched themselves on their peaceful couch, and were soon\nsound asleep, the doctor keeping the first watch. At twelve o'clock the\nlatter was relieved by Kennedy.\n\n\"Should the slightest accident happen, waken me,\" said Ferguson, \"and,\nabove all things, don't lose sight of the barometer. To us it is the\ncompass!\"\n\nThe night was cold. There were twenty-seven degrees of difference\nbetween its temperature and that of the daytime. With nightfall had\nbegun the nocturnal concert of animals driven from their hiding-places\nby hunger and thirst. The frogs struck in their guttural soprano,\nredoubled by the yelping of the jackals, while the imposing bass of the\nAfrican lion sustained the accords of this living orchestra.\n\nUpon resuming his post, in the morning, the doctor consulted his\ncompass, and found that the wind had changed during the night. The\nballoon had been bearing about thirty miles to the northwest during the\nlast two hours. It was then passing over Mabunguru, a stony country,\nstrewn with blocks of syenite of a fine polish, and knobbed with huge\nbowlders and angular ridges of rock; conic masses, like the rocks of\nKarnak, studded the soil like so many Druidic dolmens; the bones of\nbuffaloes and elephants whitened it here and there; but few trees could\nbe seen, excepting in the east, where there were dense woods, among\nwhich a few villages lay half concealed.\n\nToward seven o'clock they saw a huge round rock nearly two miles in\nextent, like an immense tortoise.\n\n\"We are on the right track,\" said Dr. Ferguson. \"There's Jihoue-la-Mkoa,\nwhere we must halt for a few minutes. I am going to renew the supply of\nwater necessary for my cylinder, and so let us try to anchor somewhere.\"\n\n\"There are very few trees,\" replied the hunter.\n\n\"Never mind, let us try. Joe, throw out the anchors!\"\n\nThe balloon, gradually losing its ascensional force, approached the\nground; the anchors ran along until, at last, one of them caught in the\nfissure of a rock, and the balloon remained motionless.\n\nIt must not be supposed that the doctor could entirely extinguish his\ncylinder, during these halts. The equilibrium of the balloon had been\ncalculated at the level of the sea; and, as the country was continually\nascending, and had reached an elevation of from six to seven hundred\nfeet, the balloon would have had a tendency to go lower than the surface\nof the soil itself. It was, therefore, necessary to sustain it by a\ncertain dilation of the gas. But, in case the doctor, in the absence\nof all wind, had let the car rest upon the ground, the balloon, thus\nrelieved of a considerable weight, would have kept up of itself, without\nthe aid of the cylinder.\n\nThe maps indicated extensive ponds on the western slope of the\nJihoue-la-Mkoa. Joe went thither alone with a cask that would hold about\nten gallons. He found the place pointed out to him, without difficulty,\nnear to a deserted village; got his stock of water, and returned in less\nthan three-quarters of an hour. He had seen nothing particular excepting\nsome immense elephant-pits. In fact, he came very near falling into one\nof them, at the bottom of which lay a half-eaten carcass.\n\nHe brought back with him a sort of clover which the apes eat with\navidity. The doctor recognized the fruit of the \"mbenbu\"-tree which\ngrows in profusion, on the western part of Jihoue-la-Mkoa. Ferguson\nwaited for Joe with a certain feeling of impatience, for even a short\nhalt in this inhospitable region always inspires a degree of fear.\n\nThe water was got aboard without trouble, as the car was nearly resting\non the ground. Joe then found it easy to loosen the anchor and leaped\nlightly to his place beside the doctor. The latter then replenished the\nflame in the cylinder, and the balloon majestically soared into the air.\n\nIt was then about one hundred miles from Kazeh, an important\nestablishment in the interior of Africa, where, thanks to a\nsouth-southeasterly current, the travellers might hope to arrive on that\nsame day. They were moving at the rate of fourteen miles per hour, and\nthe guidance of the balloon was becoming difficult, as they dared not\nrise very high without extreme dilation of the gas, the country itself\nbeing at an average height of three thousand feet. Hence, the doctor\npreferred not to force the dilation, and so adroitly followed the\nsinuosities of a pretty sharply-inclined plane, and swept very close\nto the villages of Thembo and Tura-Wels. The latter forms part of\nthe Unyamwezy, a magnificent country, where the trees attain enormous\ndimensions; among them the cactus, which grows to gigantic size.\n\nAbout two o'clock, in magnificent weather, but under a fiery sun that\ndevoured the least breath of air, the balloon was floating over the town\nof Kazeh, situated about three hundred and fifty miles from the coast.\n\n\"We left Zanzibar at nine o'clock in the morning,\" said the doctor,\nconsulting his notes, \"and, after two days' passage, we have, including\nour deviations, travelled nearly five hundred geographical miles.\nCaptains Burton and Speke took four months and a half to make the same\ndistance!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIFTEENTH.\n\nKazeh.--The Noisy Market-place.--The Appearance of the Balloon.--The\nWangaga.--The Sons of the Moon.--The Doctor's Walk.--The Population\nof the Place.--The Royal Tembe.--The Sultan's Wives.--A Royal\nDrunken-Bout.--Joe an Object of Worship.--How they Dance in the Moon.--A\nReaction.--Two Moons in one Sky.--The Instability of Divine Honors.\n\nKazeh, an important point in Central Africa, is not a city; in truth,\nthere are no cities in the interior. Kazeh is but a collection of six\nextensive excavations. There are enclosed a few houses and slave-huts,\nwith little courtyards and small gardens, carefully cultivated with\nonions, potatoes, cucumbers, pumpkins, and mushrooms, of perfect flavor,\ngrowing most luxuriantly.\n\nThe Unyamwezy is the country of the Moon--above all the rest, the\nfertile and magnificent garden-spot of Africa. In its centre is the\ndistrict of Unyanembe--a delicious region, where some families of Omani,\nwho are of very pure Arabic origin, live in luxurious idleness.\n\nThey have, for a long period, held the commerce between the interior of\nAfrica and Arabia: they trade in gums, ivory, fine muslin, and slaves.\nTheir caravans traverse these equatorial regions on all sides; and they\neven make their way to the coast in search of those articles of luxury\nand enjoyment which the wealthy merchants covet; while the latter,\nsurrounded by their wives and their attendants, lead in this charming\ncountry the least disturbed and most horizontal of lives--always\nstretched at full length, laughing, smoking, or sleeping.\n\nAround these excavations are numerous native dwellings; wide, open\nspaces for the markets; fields of cannabis and datura; superb trees and\ndepths of freshest shade--such is Kazeh!\n\nThere, too, is held the general rendezvous of the caravans--those of the\nsouth, with their slaves and their freightage of ivory; and those of the\nwest, which export cotton, glassware, and trinkets, to the tribes of the\ngreat lakes.\n\nSo in the market-place there reigns perpetual excitement, a nameless\nhubbub, made up of the cries of mixed-breed porters and carriers, the\nbeating of drums, and the twanging of horns, the neighing of mules, the\nbraying of donkeys, the singing of women, the squalling of children, and\nthe banging of the huge rattan, wielded by the jemadar or leader of the\ncaravans, who beats time to this pastoral symphony.\n\nThere, spread forth, without regard to order--indeed, we may say, in\ncharming disorder--are the showy stuffs, the glass beads, the ivory\ntusks, the rhinoceros'-teeth, the shark's-teeth, the honey, the tobacco,\nand the cotton of these regions, to be purchased at the strangest of\nbargains by customers in whose eyes each article has a price only in\nproportion to the desire it excites to possess it.\n\nAll at once this agitation, movement and noise stopped as though by\nmagic. The balloon had just come in sight, far aloft in the sky, where\nit hovered majestically for a few moments, and then descended slowly,\nwithout deviating from its perpendicular. Men, women, children,\nmerchants and slaves, Arabs and negroes, as suddenly disappeared within\nthe \"tembes\" and the huts.\n\n\"My dear doctor,\" said Kennedy, \"if we continue to produce such a\nsensation as this, we shall find some difficulty in establishing\ncommercial relations with the people hereabouts.\"\n\n\"There's one kind of trade that we might carry on, though, easily\nenough,\" said Joe; \"and that would be to go down there quietly, and walk\noff with the best of the goods, without troubling our heads about the\nmerchants; we'd get rich that way!\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the doctor, \"these natives are a little scared at first; but\nthey won't be long in coming back, either through suspicion or through\ncuriosity.\"\n\n\"Do you really think so, doctor?\"\n\n\"Well, we'll see pretty soon. But it wouldn't be prudent to go too near\nto them, for the balloon is not iron-clad, and is, therefore, not proof\nagainst either an arrow or a bullet.\"\n\n\"Then you expect to hold a parley with these blacks?\"\n\n\"If we can do so safely, why should we not? There must be some Arab\nmerchants here at Kazeh, who are better informed than the rest, and not\nso barbarous. I remember that Burton and Speke had nothing but praises\nto utter concerning the hospitality of these people; so we might, at\nleast, make the venture.\"\n\nThe balloon having, meanwhile, gradually approached the ground, one of\nthe anchors lodged in the top of a tree near the market-place.\n\nBy this time the whole population had emerged from their hiding-places\nstealthily, thrusting their heads out first. Several \"waganga,\"\nrecognizable by their badges of conical shellwork, came boldly forward.\nThey were the sorcerers of the place. They bore in their girdles small\ngourds, coated with tallow, and several other articles of witchcraft,\nall of them, by-the-way, most professionally filthy.\n\nLittle by little the crowd gathered beside them, the women and children\ngrouped around them, the drums renewed their deafening uproar, hands\nwere violently clapped together, and then raised toward the sky.\n\n\"That's their style of praying,\" said the doctor; \"and, if I'm not\nmistaken, we're going to be called upon to play a great part.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, play it!\"\n\n\"You, too, my good Joe--perhaps you're to be a god!\"\n\n\"Well, master, that won't trouble me much. I like a little flattery!\"\n\nAt this moment, one of the sorcerers, a \"myanga,\" made a sign, and all\nthe clamor died away into the profoundest silence. He then addressed a\nfew words to the strangers, but in an unknown tongue.\n\nDr. Ferguson, not having understood them, shouted some sentences in\nArabic, at a venture, and was immediately answered in that language.\n\nThe speaker below then delivered himself of a very copious harangue,\nwhich was also very flowery and very gravely listened to by his\naudience. From it the doctor was not slow in learning that the balloon\nwas mistaken for nothing less than the moon in person, and that the\namiable goddess in question had condescended to approach the town with\nher three sons--an honor that would never be forgotten in this land so\ngreatly loved by the god of day.\n\nThe doctor responded, with much dignity, that the moon made her\nprovincial tour every thousand years, feeling the necessity of showing\nherself nearer at hand to her worshippers. He, therefore, begged them\nnot to be disturbed by her presence, but to take advantage of it to make\nknown all their wants and longings.\n\nThe sorcerer, in his turn, replied that the sultan, the \"mwani,\" who had\nbeen sick for many years, implored the aid of heaven, and he invited the\nson of the moon to visit him.\n\nThe doctor acquainted his companions with the invitation.\n\n\"And you are going to call upon this negro king?\" asked Kennedy.\n\n\"Undoubtedly so; these people appear well disposed; the air is calm;\nthere is not a breath of wind, and we have nothing to fear for the\nballoon?\"\n\n\"But, what will you do?\"\n\n\"Be quiet on that score, my dear Dick. With a little medicine, I shall\nwork my way through the affair!\"\n\nThen, addressing the crowd, he said:\n\n\"The moon, taking compassion on the sovereign who is so dear to the\nchildren of Unyamwezy, has charged us to restore him to health. Let him\nprepare to receive us!\"\n\nThe clamor, the songs and demonstrations of all kinds increased twofold,\nand the whole immense ants' nest of black heads was again in motion.\n\n\"Now, my friends,\" said Dr. Ferguson, \"we must look out for every thing\nbeforehand; we may be forced to leave this at any moment, unexpectedly,\nand be off with extra speed. Dick had better remain, therefore, in the\ncar, and keep the cylinder warm so as to secure a sufficient ascensional\nforce for the balloon. The anchor is solidly fastened, and there is\nnothing to fear in that respect. I shall descend, and Joe will go with\nme, only that he must remain at the foot of the ladder.\"\n\n\"What! are you going alone into that blackamoor's den?\"\n\n\"How! doctor, am I not to go with you?\"\n\n\"No! I shall go alone; these good folks imagine that the goddess of the\nmoon has come to see them, and their superstition protects me; so have\nno fear, and each one remain at the post that I have assigned to him.\"\n\n\"Well, since you wish it,\" sighed Kennedy.\n\n\"Look closely to the dilation of the gas.\"\n\n\"Agreed!\"\n\nBy this time the shouts of the natives had swelled to double volume as\nthey vehemently implored the aid of the heavenly powers.\n\n\"There, there,\" said Joe, \"they're rather rough in their orders to their\ngood moon and her divine sons.\"\n\nThe doctor, equipped with his travelling medicine-chest, descended to\nthe ground, preceded by Joe, who kept a straight countenance and looked\nas grave and knowing as the circumstances of the case required. He then\nseated himself at the foot of the ladder in the Arab fashion, with his\nlegs crossed under him, and a portion of the crowd collected around him\nin a circle, at respectful distances.\n\nIn the meanwhile the doctor, escorted to the sound of savage\ninstruments, and with wild religious dances, slowly proceeded toward the\nroyal \"tembe,\" situated a considerable distance outside of the town. It\nwas about three o'clock, and the sun was shining brilliantly. In fact,\nwhat less could it do upon so grand an occasion!\n\nThe doctor stepped along with great dignity, the waganga surrounding him\nand keeping off the crowd. He was soon joined by the natural son of the\nsultan, a handsomely-built young fellow, who, according to the custom of\nthe country, was the sole heir of the paternal goods, to the exclusion\nof the old man's legitimate children. He prostrated himself before the\nson of the moon, but the latter graciously raised him to his feet.\n\nThree-quarters of an hour later, through shady paths, surrounded by\nall the luxuriance of tropical vegetation, this enthusiastic procession\narrived at the sultan's palace, a sort of square edifice called\nititenya, and situated on the slope of a hill.\n\nA kind of veranda, formed by the thatched roof, adorned the outside,\nsupported upon wooden pillars, which had some pretensions to being\ncarved. Long lines of dark-red clay decorated the walls in characters\nthat strove to reproduce the forms of men and serpents, the latter\nbetter imitated, of course, than the former. The roofing of this abode\ndid not rest directly upon the walls, and the air could, therefore,\ncirculate freely, but windows there were none, and the door hardly\ndeserved the name.\n\nDr. Ferguson was received with all the honors by the guards and\nfavorites of the sultan; these were men of a fine race, the Wanyamwezi\nso-called, a pure type of the central African populations, strong,\nrobust, well-made, and in splendid condition. Their hair, divided into\na great number of small tresses, fell over their shoulders, and by means\nof black-and-blue incisions they had tattooed their cheeks from the\ntemples to the mouth. Their ears, frightfully distended, held dangling\nto them disks of wood and plates of gum copal. They were clad in\nbrilliantly-painted cloths, and the soldiers were armed with the\nsaw-toothed war-club, the bow and arrows barbed and poisoned with the\njuice of the euphorbium, the cutlass, the \"sima,\" a long sabre (also\nwith saw-like teeth), and some small battle-axes.\n\nThe doctor advanced into the palace, and there, notwithstanding the\nsultan's illness, the din, which was terrific before, redoubled the\ninstant that he arrived. He noticed, at the lintels of the door,\nsome rabbits' tails and zebras' manes, suspended as talismans. He was\nreceived by the whole troop of his majesty's wives, to the harmonious\naccords of the \"upatu,\" a sort of cymbal made of the bottom of a copper\nkettle, and to the uproar of the \"kilindo,\" a drum five feet high,\nhollowed out from the trunk of a tree, and hammered by the ponderous,\nhorny fists of two jet-black virtuosi.\n\nMost of the women were rather good-looking, and they laughed and\nchattered merrily as they smoked their tobacco and \"thang\" in huge black\npipes. They seemed to be well made, too, under the long robes that they\nwore gracefully flung about their persons, and carried a sort of \"kilt\"\nwoven from the fibres of calabash fastened around their girdles.\n\nSix of them were not the least merry of the party, although put aside\nfrom the rest, and reserved for a cruel fate. On the death of the\nsultan, they were to be buried alive with him, so as to occupy and\ndivert his mind during the period of eternal solitude.\n\nDr. Ferguson, taking in the whole scene at a rapid glance, approached\nthe wooden couch on which the sultan lay reclining. There he saw a man\nof about forty, completely brutalized by orgies of every description,\nand in a condition that left little or nothing to be done. The\nsickness that had afflicted him for so many years was simply perpetual\ndrunkenness. The royal sot had nearly lost all consciousness, and all\nthe ammonia in the world would not have set him on his feet again.\n\nHis favorites and the women kept on bended knees during this solemn\nvisit. By means of a few drops of powerful cordial, the doctor for a\nmoment reanimated the imbruted carcass that lay before him. The sultan\nstirred, and, for a dead body that had given no sign whatever of\nlife for several hours previously, this symptom was received with a\ntremendous repetition of shouts and cries in the doctor's honor.\n\nThe latter, who had seen enough of it by this time, by a rapid motion\nput aside his too demonstrative admirers and went out of the palace,\ndirecting his steps immediately toward the balloon, for it was now six\no'clock in the evening.\n\nJoe, during his absence, had been quietly waiting at the foot of the\nladder, where the crowd paid him their most humble respects. Like a\ngenuine son of the moon, he let them keep on. For a divinity, he had\nthe air of a very clever sort of fellow, by no means proud, nay, even\npleasingly familiar with the young negresses, who seemed never to tire\nof looking at him. Besides, he went so far as to chat agreeably with\nthem.\n\n\"Worship me, ladies! worship me!\" he said to them. \"I'm a clever sort of\ndevil, if I am the son of a goddess.\"\n\nThey brought him propitiatory gifts, such as are usually deposited in\nthe fetich huts or mzimu. These gifts consisted of stalks of barley and\nof \"pombe.\" Joe considered himself in duty bound to taste the latter\nspecies of strong beer, but his palate, although accustomed to gin and\nwhiskey, could not withstand the strength of the new beverage, and he\nhad to make a horrible grimace, which his dusky friends took to be a\nbenevolent smile.\n\nThereupon, the young damsels, conjoining their voices in a drawling\nchant, began to dance around him with the utmost gravity.\n\n\"Ah! you're dancing, are you?\" said he. \"Well, I won't be behind you in\npoliteness, and so I'll give you one of my country reels.\"\n\nSo at it he went, in one of the wildest jigs that ever was seen,\ntwisting, turning, and jerking himself in all directions; dancing with\nhis hands, dancing with his body, dancing with his knees, dancing\nwith his feet; describing the most fearful contortions and extravagant\nevolutions; throwing himself into incredible attitudes; grimacing beyond\nall belief, and, in fine giving his savage admirers a strange idea of\nthe style of ballet adopted by the deities in the moon.\n\nThen, the whole collection of blacks, naturally as imitative as monkeys,\nat once reproduced all his airs and graces, his leaps and shakes and\ncontortions; they did not lose a single gesticulation; they did not\nforget an attitude; and the result was, such a pandemonium of movement,\nnoise, and excitement, as it would be out of the question even feebly\nto describe. But, in the very midst of the fun, Joe saw the doctor\napproaching.\n\nThe latter was coming at full speed, surrounded by a yelling and\ndisorderly throng. The chiefs and sorcerers seemed to be highly excited.\nThey were close upon the doctor's heels, crowding and threatening him.\n\nSingular reaction! What had happened? Had the sultan unluckily perished\nin the hands of his celestial physician?\n\nKennedy, from his post of observation, saw the danger without knowing\nwhat had caused it, and the balloon, powerfully urged by the dilation\nof the gas, strained and tugged at the ropes that held it as though\nimpatient to soar away.\n\nThe doctor had got as far as the foot of the ladder. A superstitious\nfear still held the crowd aloof and hindered them from committing any\nviolence on his person. He rapidly scaled the ladder, and Joe followed\nhim with his usual agility.\n\n\"Not a moment to lose!\" said the doctor. \"Don't attempt to let go the\nanchor! We'll cut the cord! Follow me!\"\n\n\"But what's the matter?\" asked Joe, clambering into the car.\n\n\"What's happened?\" questioned Kennedy, rifle in hand.\n\n\"Look!\" replied the doctor, pointing to the horizon.\n\n\"Well?\" ejaculated the Scot.\n\n\"Well! the moon!\"\n\nAnd, in fact, there was the moon rising red and magnificent, a globe of\nfire in a field of blue! It was she, indeed--she and the balloon!--both\nin one sky!\n\nEither there were two moons, then, or these strangers were imposters,\ndesigning scamps, false deities!\n\nSuch were the very natural reflections of the crowd, and hence the\nreaction in their feelings.\n\nJoe could not, for the life of him, keep in a roar of laughter; and the\npopulation of Kazeh, comprehending that their prey was slipping through\ntheir clutches, set up prolonged howlings, aiming, the while, their bows\nand muskets at the balloon.\n\nBut one of the sorcerers made a sign, and all the weapons were lowered.\nHe then began to climb into the tree, intending to seize the rope and\nbring the machine to the ground.\n\nJoe leaned out with a hatchet ready. \"Shall I cut away?\" said he.\n\n\"No; wait a moment,\" replied the doctor.\n\n\"But this black?\"\n\n\"We may, perhaps, save our anchor--and I hold a great deal by that.\nThere'll always be time enough to cut loose.\"\n\nThe sorcerer, having climbed to the right place, worked so vigorously\nthat he succeeded in detaching the anchor, and the latter, violently\njerked, at that moment, by the start of the balloon, caught the rascal\nbetween the limbs, and carried him off astride of it through the air.\n\nThe stupefaction of the crowd was indescribable as they saw one of their\nwaganga thus whirled away into space.\n\n\"Huzza!\" roared Joe, as the balloon--thanks to its ascensional\nforce--shot up higher into the sky, with increased rapidity.\n\n\"He holds on well,\" said Kennedy; \"a little trip will do him good.\"\n\n\"Shall we let this darky drop all at once?\" inquired Joe.\n\n\"Oh no,\" replied the doctor, \"we'll let him down easily; and I warrant\nme that, after such an adventure, the power of the wizard will be\nenormously enhanced in the sight of his comrades.\"\n\n\"Why, I wouldn't put it past them to make a god of him!\" said Joe, with\na laugh.\n\nThe Victoria, by this time, had risen to the height of one thousand\nfeet, and the black hung to the rope with desperate energy. He had\nbecome completely silent, and his eyes were fixed, for his terror was\nblended with amazement. A light west wind was sweeping the balloon right\nover the town, and far beyond it.\n\nHalf an hour later, the doctor, seeing the country deserted, moderated\nthe flame of his cylinder, and descended toward the ground. At twenty\nfeet above the turf, the affrighted sorcerer made up his mind in a\ntwinkling: he let himself drop, fell on his feet, and scampered off at\na furious pace toward Kazeh; while the balloon, suddenly relieved of his\nweight, again shot up on her course.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIXTEENTH.\n\nSymptoms of a Storm.--The Country of the Moon.--The Future of the\nAfrican Continent.--The Last Machine of all.--A View of the Country at\nSunset.--Flora and Fauna.--The Tempest.--The Zone of Fire.--The Starry\nHeavens.\n\n\"See,\" said Joe, \"what comes of playing the sons of the moon without her\nleave! She came near serving us an ugly trick. But say, master, did you\ndamage your credit as a physician?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" chimed in the sportsman. \"What kind of a dignitary was\nthis Sultan of Kazeh?\"\n\n\"An old half-dead sot,\" replied the doctor, \"whose loss will not be very\nseverely felt. But the moral of all this is that honors are fleeting,\nand we must not take too great a fancy to them.\"\n\n\"So much the worse!\" rejoined Joe. \"I liked the thing--to be\nworshipped!--Play the god as you like! Why, what would any one ask more\nthan that? By-the-way, the moon did come up, too, and all red, as if she\nwas in a rage.\"\n\nWhile the three friends went on chatting of this and other things, and\nJoe examined the luminary of night from an entirely novel point of view,\nthe heavens became covered with heavy clouds to the northward, and the\nlowering masses assumed a most sinister and threatening look. Quite a\nsmart breeze, found about three hundred feet from the earth, drove the\nballoon toward the north-northeast; and above it the blue vault was\nclear; but the atmosphere felt close and dull.\n\nThe aeronauts found themselves, at about eight in the evening, in\nthirty-two degrees forty minutes east longitude, and four degrees\nseventeen minutes latitude. The atmospheric currents, under the\ninfluence of a tempest not far off, were driving them at the rate of\nfrom thirty to thirty-five miles an hour; the undulating and fertile\nplains of Mfuto were passing swiftly beneath them. The spectacle was one\nworthy of admiration--and admire it they did.\n\n\"We are now right in the country of the Moon,\" said Dr. Ferguson; \"for\nit has retained the name that antiquity gave it, undoubtedly, because\nthe moon has been worshipped there in all ages. It is, really, a superb\ncountry.\"\n\n\"It would be hard to find more splendid vegetation.\"\n\n\"If we found the like of it around London it would not be natural, but\nit would be very pleasant,\" put in Joe. \"Why is it that such savage\ncountries get all these fine things?\"\n\n\"And who knows,\" said the doctor, \"that this country may not, one day,\nbecome the centre of civilization? The races of the future may repair\nhither, when Europe shall have become exhausted in the effort to feed\nher inhabitants.\"\n\n\"Do you think so, really?\" asked Kennedy.\n\n\"Undoubtedly, my dear Dick. Just note the progress of events: consider\nthe migrations of races, and you will arrive at the same conclusion\nassuredly. Asia was the first nurse of the world, was she not? For about\nfour thousand years she travailed, she grew pregnant, she produced, and\nthen, when stones began to cover the soil where the golden harvests sung\nby Homer had flourished, her children abandoned her exhausted and\nbarren bosom. You next see them precipitating themselves upon young\nand vigorous Europe, which has nourished them for the last two thousand\nyears. But already her fertility is beginning to die out; her productive\npowers are diminishing every day. Those new diseases that annually\nattack the products of the soil, those defective crops, those\ninsufficient resources, are all signs of a vitality that is rapidly\nwearing out and of an approaching exhaustion. Thus, we already see the\nmillions rushing to the luxuriant bosom of America, as a source of help,\nnot inexhaustible indeed, but not yet exhausted. In its turn, that new\ncontinent will grow old; its virgin forests will fall before the axe\nof industry, and its soil will become weak through having too fully\nproduced what had been demanded of it. Where two harvests bloomed every\nyear, hardly one will be gathered from a soil completely drained of its\nstrength. Then, Africa will be there to offer to new races the treasures\nthat for centuries have been accumulating in her breast. Those climates\nnow so fatal to strangers will be purified by cultivation and by\ndrainage of the soil, and those scattered water supplies will be\ngathered into one common bed to form an artery of navigation. Then this\ncountry over which we are now passing, more fertile, richer, and fuller\nof vitality than the rest, will become some grand realm where more\nastonishing discoveries than steam and electricity will be brought to\nlight.\"\n\n\"Ah! sir,\" said Joe, \"I'd like to see all that.\"\n\n\"You got up too early in the morning, my boy!\"\n\n\"Besides,\" said Kennedy, \"that may prove to be a very dull period when\nindustry will swallow up every thing for its own profit. By dint of\ninventing machinery, men will end in being eaten up by it! I have always\nfancied that the end of the earth will be when some enormous boiler,\nheated to three thousand millions of atmospheric pressure, shall explode\nand blow up our Globe!\"\n\n\"And I add that the Americans,\" said Joe, \"will not have been the last\nto work at the machine!\"\n\n\"In fact,\" assented the doctor, \"they are great boiler-makers! But,\nwithout allowing ourselves to be carried away by such speculations, let\nus rest content with enjoying the beauties of this country of the Moon,\nsince we have been permitted to see it.\"\n\nThe sun, darting his last rays beneath the masses of heaped-up cloud,\nadorned with a crest of gold the slightest inequalities of the\nground below; gigantic trees, arborescent bushes, mosses on the even\nsurface--all had their share of this luminous effulgence. The soil,\nslightly undulating, here and there rose into little conical hills;\nthere were no mountains visible on the horizon; immense brambly\npalisades, impenetrable hedges of thorny jungle, separated the clearings\ndotted with numerous villages, and immense euphorbiae surrounded\nthem with natural fortifications, interlacing their trunks with the\ncoral-shaped branches of the shrubbery and undergrowth.\n\nEre long, the Malagazeri, the chief tributary of Lake Tanganayika, was\nseen winding between heavy thickets of verdure, offering an asylum to\nmany water-courses that spring from the torrents formed in the season\nof freshets, or from ponds hollowed in the clayey soil. To observers\nlooking from a height, it was a chain of waterfalls thrown across the\nwhole western face of the country.\n\nAnimals with huge humps were feeding in the luxuriant prairies, and were\nhalf hidden, sometimes, in the tall grass; spreading forests in bloom\nredolent of spicy perfumes presented themselves to the gaze like immense\nbouquets; but, in these bouquets, lions, leopards, hyenas, and tigers,\nwere then crouching for shelter from the last hot rays of the\nsetting sun. From time to time, an elephant made the tall tops of the\nundergrowth sway to and fro, and you could hear the crackling of huge\nbranches as his ponderous ivory tusks broke them in his way.\n\n\"What a sporting country!\" exclaimed Dick, unable longer to restrain his\nenthusiasm; \"why, a single ball fired at random into those forests would\nbring down game worthy of it. Suppose we try it once!\"\n\n\"No, my dear Dick; the night is close at hand--a threatening night with\na tempest in the background--and the storms are awful in this country,\nwhere the heated soil is like one vast electric battery.\"\n\n\"You are right, sir,\" said Joe, \"the heat has got to be enough to\nchoke one, and the breeze has died away. One can feel that something's\ncoming.\"\n\n\"The atmosphere is saturated with electricity,\" replied the doctor;\n\"every living creature is sensible that this state of the air portends a\nstruggle of the elements, and I confess that I never before was so full\nof the fluid myself.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" suggested Dick, \"would it not be advisable to alight?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, Dick, I'd rather go up, only that I am afraid of being\ncarried out of my course by these counter-currents contending in the\natmosphere.\"\n\n\"Have you any idea, then, of abandoning the route that we have followed\nsince we left the coast?\"\n\n\"If I can manage to do so,\" replied the doctor, \"I will turn more\ndirectly northward, by from seven to eight degrees; I shall then\nendeavor to ascend toward the presumed latitudes of the sources of the\nNile; perhaps we may discover some traces of Captain Speke's expedition\nor of M. de Heuglin's caravan. Unless I am mistaken, we are at\nthirty-two degrees forty minutes east longitude, and I should like to\nascend directly north of the equator.\"\n\n\"Look there!\" exclaimed Kennedy, suddenly, \"see those hippopotami\nsliding out of the pools--those masses of blood-colored flesh--and those\ncrocodiles snuffing the air aloud!\"\n\n\"They're choking!\" ejaculated Joe. \"Ah! what a fine way to travel this\nis; and how one can snap his fingers at all that vermin!--Doctor! Mr.\nKennedy! see those packs of wild animals hurrying along close together.\nThere are fully two hundred. Those are wolves.\"\n\n\"No! Joe, not wolves, but wild dogs; a famous breed that does not\nhesitate to attack the lion himself. They are the worst customers a\ntraveller could meet, for they would instantly tear him to pieces.\"\n\n\"Well, it isn't Joe that'll undertake to muzzle them!\" responded that\namiable youth. \"After all, though, if that's the nature of the beast, we\nmustn't be too hard on them for it!\"\n\nSilence gradually settled down under the influence of the impending\nstorm: the thickened air actually seemed no longer adapted to the\ntransmission of sound; the atmosphere appeared MUFFLED, and, like a\nroom hung with tapestry, lost all its sonorous reverberation. The\n\"rover bird\" so-called, the coroneted crane, the red and blue jays,\nthe mocking-bird, the flycatcher, disappeared among the foliage of the\nimmense trees, and all nature revealed symptoms of some approaching\ncatastrophe.\n\nAt nine o'clock the Victoria hung motionless over Msene, an extensive\ngroup of villages scarcely distinguishable in the gloom. Once in a\nwhile, the reflection of a wandering ray of light in the dull water\ndisclosed a succession of ditches regularly arranged, and, by one last\ngleam, the eye could make out the calm and sombre forms of palm-trees,\nsycamores, and gigantic euphorbiae.\n\n\"I am stifling!\" said the Scot, inhaling, with all the power of his\nlungs, as much as possible of the rarefied air. \"We are not moving an\ninch! Let us descend!\"\n\n\"But the tempest!\" said the doctor, with much uneasiness.\n\n\"If you are afraid of being carried away by the wind, it seems to me\nthat there is no other course to pursue.\"\n\n\"Perhaps the storm won't burst to-night,\" said Joe; \"the clouds are very\nhigh.\"\n\n\"That is just the thing that makes me hesitate about going beyond them;\nwe should have to rise still higher, lose sight of the earth, and\nnot know all night whether we were moving forward or not, or in what\ndirection we were going.\"\n\n\"Make up your mind, dear doctor, for time presses!\"\n\n\"It's a pity that the wind has fallen,\" said Joe, again; \"it would have\ncarried us clear of the storm.\"\n\n\"It is, indeed, a pity, my friends,\" rejoined the doctor. \"The clouds\nare dangerous for us; they contain opposing currents which might catch\nus in their eddies, and lightnings that might set on fire. Again, those\nperils avoided, the force of the tempest might hurl us to the ground,\nwere we to cast our anchor in the tree-tops.\"\n\n\"Then what shall we do?\"\n\n\"Well, we must try to get the balloon into a medium zone of the\natmosphere, and there keep her suspended between the perils of the\nheavens and those of the earth. We have enough water for the cylinder,\nand our two hundred pounds of ballast are untouched. In case of\nemergency I can use them.\"\n\n\"We will keep watch with you,\" said the hunter.\n\n\"No, my friends, put the provisions under shelter, and lie down; I will\nrouse you, if it becomes necessary.\"\n\n\"But, master, wouldn't you do well to take some rest yourself, as\nthere's no danger close on us just now?\" insisted poor Joe.\n\n\"No, thank you, my good fellow, I prefer to keep awake. We are not\nmoving, and should circumstances not change, we'll find ourselves\nto-morrow in exactly the same place.\"\n\n\"Good-night, then, sir!\"\n\n\"Good-night, if you can only find it so!\"\n\nKennedy and Joe stretched themselves out under their blankets, and the\ndoctor remained alone in the immensity of space.\n\nHowever, the huge dome of clouds visibly descended, and the darkness\nbecame profound. The black vault closed in upon the earth as if to crush\nit in its embrace.\n\nAll at once a violent, rapid, incisive flash of lightning pierced the\ngloom, and the rent it made had not closed ere a frightful clap of\nthunder shook the celestial depths.\n\n\"Up! up! turn out!\" shouted Ferguson.\n\nThe two sleepers, aroused by the terrible concussion, were at the\ndoctor's orders in a moment.\n\n\"Shall we descend?\" said Kennedy.\n\n\"No! the balloon could not stand it. Let us go up before those clouds\ndissolve in water, and the wind is let loose!\" and, so saying, the\ndoctor actively stirred up the flame of the cylinder, and turned it on\nthe spirals of the serpentine siphon.\n\nThe tempests of the tropics develop with a rapidity equalled only by\ntheir violence. A second flash of lightning rent the darkness, and was\nfollowed by a score of others in quick succession. The sky was crossed\nand dotted, like the zebra's hide, with electric sparks, which danced\nand flickered beneath the great drops of rain.\n\n\"We have delayed too long,\" exclaimed the doctor; \"we must now\npass through a zone of fire, with our balloon filled as it is with\ninflammable gas!\"\n\n\"But let us descend, then! let us descend!\" urged Kennedy.\n\n\"The risk of being struck would be just about even, and we should soon\nbe torn to pieces by the branches of the trees!\"\n\n\"We are going up, doctor!\"\n\n\"Quicker, quicker still!\"\n\nIn this part of Africa, during the equatorial storms, it is not rare to\ncount from thirty to thirty-five flashes of lightning per minute. The\nsky is literally on fire, and the crashes of thunder are continuous.\n\nThe wind burst forth with frightful violence in this burning atmosphere;\nit twisted the blazing clouds; one might have compared it to the breath\nof some gigantic bellows, fanning all this conflagration.\n\nDr. Ferguson kept his cylinder at full heat, and the balloon dilated and\nwent up, while Kennedy, on his knees, held together the curtains of\nthe awning. The balloon whirled round wildly enough to make their heads\nturn, and the aeronauts got some very alarming jolts, indeed, as their\nmachine swung and swayed in all directions. Huge cavities would form in\nthe silk of the balloon as the wind fiercely bent it in, and the stuff\nfairly cracked like a pistol as it flew back from the pressure. A\nsort of hail, preceded by a rumbling noise, hissed through the air and\nrattled on the covering of the Victoria. The latter, however, continued\nto ascend, while the lightning described tangents to the convexity of\nher circumference; but she bore on, right through the midst of the fire.\n\n\"God protect us!\" said Dr. Ferguson, solemnly, \"we are in His hands;\nHe alone can save us--but let us be ready for every event, even for\nfire--our fall could not be very rapid.\"\n\nThe doctor's voice could scarcely be heard by his companions; but they\ncould see his countenance calm as ever even amid the flashing of the\nlightnings; he was watching the phenomena of phosphorescence produced\nby the fires of St. Elmo, that were now skipping to and fro along the\nnetwork of the balloon.\n\nThe latter whirled and swung, but steadily ascended, and, ere the hour\nwas over, it had passed the stormy belt. The electric display was going\non below it like a vast crown of artificial fireworks suspended from the\ncar.\n\nThen they enjoyed one of the grandest spectacles that Nature can offer\nto the gaze of man. Below them, the tempest; above them, the starry\nfirmament, tranquil, mute, impassible, with the moon projecting her\npeaceful rays over these angry clouds.\n\nDr. Ferguson consulted the barometer; it announced twelve thousand feet\nof elevation. It was then eleven o'clock at night.\n\n\"Thank Heaven, all danger is past; all we have to do now, is, to keep\nourselves at this height,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"It was frightful!\" remarked Kennedy.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Joe, \"it gives a little variety to the trip, and I'm not\nsorry to have seen a storm from a trifling distance up in the air. It's\na fine sight!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVENTEENTH.\n\nThe Mountains of the Moon.--An Ocean of Verdure.--They cast Anchor.--The\nTowing Elephant.--A Running Fire.--Death of the Monster.--The\nField-Oven.--A Meal on the Grass.--A Night on the Ground.\n\nAbout four in the morning, Monday, the sun reappeared in the horizon;\nthe clouds had dispersed, and a cheery breeze refreshed the morning\ndawn.\n\nThe earth, all redolent with fragrant exhalations, reappeared to the\ngaze of our travellers. The balloon, whirled about by opposing currents,\nhad hardly budged from its place, and the doctor, letting the gas\ncontract, descended so as to get a more northerly direction. For a long\nwhile his quest was fruitless; the wind carried him toward the west\nuntil he came in sight of the famous Mountains of the Moon, which\ngrouped themselves in a semicircle around the extremity of Lake\nTanganayika; their ridges, but slightly indented, stood out against\nthe bluish horizon, so that they might have been mistaken for a natural\nfortification, not to be passed by the explorers of the centre of\nAfrica. Among them were a few isolated cones, revealing the mark of the\neternal snows.\n\n\"Here we are at last,\" said the doctor, \"in an unexplored country!\nCaptain Burton pushed very far to the westward, but he could not reach\nthose celebrated mountains; he even denied their existence, strongly\nas it was affirmed by Speke, his companion. He pretended that they were\nborn in the latter's fancy; but for us, my friends, there is no further\ndoubt possible.\"\n\n\"Shall we cross them?\" asked Kennedy.\n\n\"Not, if it please God. I am looking for a wind that will take me back\ntoward the equator. I will even wait for one, if necessary, and will\nmake the balloon like a ship that casts anchor, until favorable breezes\ncome up.\"\n\nBut the foresight of the doctor was not long in bringing its reward;\nfor, after having tried different heights, the Victoria at length began\nto sail off to the northeastward with medium speed.\n\n\"We are in the right track,\" said the doctor, consulting his compass,\n\"and scarcely two hundred feet from the surface; lucky circumstances\nfor us, enabling us, as they do, to reconnoitre these new regions. When\nCaptain Speke set out to discover Lake Ukereoue, he ascended more to the\neastward in a straight line above Kazeh.\"\n\n\"Shall we keep on long in this way?\" inquired the Scot.\n\n\"Perhaps. Our object is to push a point in the direction of the sources\nof the Nile; and we have more than six hundred miles to make before\nwe get to the extreme limit reached by the explorers who came from the\nnorth.\"\n\n\"And we shan't set foot on the solid ground?\" murmured Joe; \"it's enough\nto cramp a fellow's legs!\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, indeed, my good Joe,\" said the doctor, reassuring him; \"we\nhave to economize our provisions, you know; and on the way, Dick, you\nmust get us some fresh meat.\"\n\n\"Whenever you like, doctor.\"\n\n\"We shall also have to replenish our stock of water. Who knows but we\nmay be carried to some of the dried-up regions? So we cannot take too\nmany precautions.\"\n\nAt noon the Victoria was at twenty-nine degrees fifteen minutes east\nlongitude, and three degrees fifteen minutes south latitude. She passed\nthe village of Uyofu, the last northern limit of the Unyamwezi, opposite\nto the Lake Ukereoue, which could still be seen.\n\nThe tribes living near to the equator seem to be a little more\ncivilized, and are governed by absolute monarchs, whose control is an\nunlimited despotism. Their most compact union of power constitutes the\nprovince of Karagwah.\n\nIt was decided by the aeronauts that they would alight at the first\nfavorable place. They found that they should have to make a prolonged\nhalt, and take a careful inspection of the balloon: so the flame of the\ncylinder was moderated, and the anchors, flung out from the car, ere\nlong began to sweep the grass of an immense prairie, that, from a\ncertain height, looked like a shaven lawn, but the growth of which, in\nreality, was from seven to eight feet in height.\n\nThe balloon skimmed this tall grass without bending it, like a gigantic\nbutterfly: not an obstacle was in sight; it was an ocean of verdure\nwithout a single breaker.\n\n\"We might proceed a long time in this style,\" remarked Kennedy; \"I don't\nsee one tree that we could approach, and I'm afraid that our hunt's\nover.\"\n\n\"Wait, Dick; you could not hunt anyhow in this grass, that grows higher\nthan your head. We'll find a favorable place presently.\"\n\nIn truth, it was a charming excursion that they were making now--a\nveritable navigation on this green, almost transparent sea, gently\nundulating in the breath of the wind. The little car seemed to cleave\nthe waves of verdure, and, from time to time, coveys of birds of\nmagnificent plumage would rise fluttering from the tall herbage, and\nspeed away with joyous cries. The anchors plunged into this lake of\nflowers, and traced a furrow that closed behind them, like the wake of a\nship.\n\nAll at once a sharp shock was felt--the anchor had caught in the fissure\nof some rock hidden in the high grass.\n\n\"We are fast!\" exclaimed Joe.\n\nThese words had scarcely been uttered when a shrill cry rang through the\nair, and the following phrases, mingled with exclamations, escaped from\nthe lips of our travellers:\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"A strange cry!\"\n\n\"Look! Why, we're moving!\"\n\n\"The anchor has slipped!\"\n\n\"No; it holds, and holds fast too!\" said Joe, who was tugging at the\nrope.\n\n\"It's the rock, then, that's moving!\"\n\nAn immense rustling was noticed in the grass, and soon an elongated,\nwinding shape was seen rising above it.\n\n\"A serpent!\" shouted Joe.\n\n\"A serpent!\" repeated Kennedy, handling his rifle.\n\n\"No,\" said the doctor, \"it's an elephant's trunk!\"\n\n\"An elephant, Samuel?\"\n\nAnd, as Kennedy said this, he drew his rifle to his shoulder.\n\n\"Wait, Dick; wait!\"\n\n\"That's a fact! The animal's towing us!\"\n\n\"And in the right direction, Joe--in the right direction.\"\n\nThe elephant was now making some headway, and soon reached a clearing\nwhere his whole body could be seen. By his gigantic size, the doctor\nrecognized a male of a superb species. He had two whitish tusks,\nbeautifully curved, and about eight feet in length; and in these the\nshanks of the anchor had firmly caught. The animal was vainly trying\nwith his trunk to disengage himself from the rope that attached him to\nthe car.\n\n\"Get up--go ahead, old fellow!\" shouted Joe, with delight, doing\nhis best to urge this rather novel team. \"Here is a new style of\ntravelling!--no more horses for me. An elephant, if you please!\"\n\n\"But where is he taking us to?\" said Kennedy, whose rifle itched in his\ngrasp.\n\n\"He's taking us exactly to where we want to go, my dear Dick. A little\npatience!\"\n\n\"'Wig-a-more! wig-a-more!' as the Scotch country folks say,\" shouted\nJoe, in high glee. \"Gee-up! gee-up there!\"\n\nThe huge animal now broke into a very rapid gallop. He flung his trunk\nfrom side to side, and his monstrous bounds gave the car several rather\nheavy thumps. Meanwhile the doctor stood ready, hatchet in hand, to cut\nthe rope, should need arise.\n\n\"But,\" said he, \"we shall not give up our anchor until the last moment.\"\n\nThis drive, with an elephant for the team, lasted about an hour and a\nhalf; yet the animal did not seem in the least fatigued. These immense\ncreatures can go over a great deal of ground, and, from one day to\nanother, are found at enormous distances from there they were last seen,\nlike the whales, whose mass and speed they rival.\n\n\"In fact,\" said Joe, \"it's a whale that we have harpooned; and we're\nonly doing just what whalemen do when out fishing.\"\n\nBut a change in the nature of the ground compelled the doctor to vary\nhis style of locomotion. A dense grove of calmadores was descried on\nthe horizon, about three miles away, on the north of the prairie. So it\nbecame necessary to detach the balloon from its draught-animal at last.\n\nKennedy was intrusted with the job of bringing the elephant to a halt.\nHe drew his rifle to his shoulder, but his position was not favorable to\na successful shot; so that the first ball fired flattened itself on\nthe animal's skull, as it would have done against an iron plate. The\ncreature did not seem in the least troubled by it; but, at the sound of\nthe discharge, he had increased his speed, and now was going as fast as\na horse at full gallop.\n\n\"The deuce!\" ejaculated Kennedy.\n\n\"What a solid head!\" commented Joe.\n\n\"We'll try some conical balls behind the shoulder-joint,\" said Kennedy,\nreloading his rifle with care. In another moment he fired.\n\nThe animal gave a terrible cry, but went on faster than ever.\n\n\"Come!\" said Joe, taking aim with another gun, \"I must help you, or\nwe'll never end it.\" And now two balls penetrated the creature's side.\n\nThe elephant halted, lifted his trunk, and resumed his run toward the\nwood with all his speed; he shook his huge head, and the blood began to\ngush from his wounds.\n\n\"Let us keep up our fire, Mr. Kennedy.\"\n\n\"And a continuous fire, too,\" urged the doctor, \"for we are close on the\nwoods.\"\n\nTen shots more were discharged. The elephant made a fearful bound; the\ncar and balloon cracked as though every thing were going to pieces, and\nthe shock made the doctor drop his hatchet on the ground.\n\nThe situation was thus rendered really very alarming; the anchor-rope,\nwhich had securely caught, could not be disengaged, nor could it yet be\ncut by the knives of our aeronauts, and the balloon was rushing headlong\ntoward the wood, when the animal received a ball in the eye just as he\nlifted his head. On this he halted, faltered, his knees bent under him,\nand he uncovered his whole flank to the assaults of his enemies in the\nballoon.\n\n\"A bullet in his heart!\" said Kennedy, discharging one last rifle-shot.\n\nThe elephant uttered a long bellow of terror and agony, then raised\nhimself up for a moment, twirling his trunk in the air, and finally fell\nwith all his weight upon one of his tusks, which he broke off short. He\nwas dead.\n\n\"His tusk's broken!\" exclaimed Kennedy--\"ivory too that in England would\nbring thirty-five guineas per hundred pounds.\"\n\n\"As much as that?\" said Joe, scrambling down to the ground by the\nanchor-rope.\n\n\"What's the use of sighing over it, Dick?\" said the doctor. \"Are we\nivory merchants? Did we come hither to make money?\"\n\nJoe examined the anchor and found it solidly attached to the unbroken\ntusk. The doctor and Dick leaped out on the ground, while the balloon,\nnow half emptied, hovered over the body of the huge animal.\n\n\"What a splendid beast!\" said Kennedy, \"what a mass of flesh! I never\nsaw an elephant of that size in India!\"\n\n\"There's nothing surprising about that, my dear Dick; the elephants\nof Central Africa are the finest in the world. The Andersons and the\nCummings have hunted so incessantly in the neighborhood of the Cape,\nthat these animals have migrated to the equator, where they are often\nmet with in large herds.\"\n\n\"In the mean while, I hope,\" added Joe, \"that we'll taste a morsel of\nthis fellow. I'll undertake to get you a good dinner at his expense. Mr.\nKennedy will go off and hunt for an hour or two; the doctor will make an\ninspection of the balloon, and, while they're busy in that way, I'll do\nthe cooking.\"\n\n\"A good arrangement!\" said the doctor; \"so do as you like, Joe.\"\n\n\"As for me,\" said the hunter, \"I shall avail myself of the two hours'\nrecess that Joe has condescended to let me have.\"\n\n\"Go, my friend, but no imprudence! Don't wander too far away.\"\n\n\"Never fear, doctor!\" and, so saying, Dick, shouldering his gun, plunged\ninto the woods.\n\nForthwith Joe went to work at his vocation. At first he made a hole in\nthe ground two feet deep; this he filled with the dry wood that was so\nabundantly scattered about, where it had been strewn by the elephants,\nwhose tracks could be seen where they had made their way through the\nforest. This hole filled, he heaped a pile of fagots on it a foot in\nheight, and set fire to it.\n\nThen he went back to the carcass of the elephant, which had fallen only\nabout a hundred feet from the edge of the forest; he next proceeded\nadroitly to cut off the trunk, which might have been two feet in\ndiameter at the base; of this he selected the most delicate portion, and\nthen took with it one of the animal's spongy feet. In fact, these are\nthe finest morsels, like the hump of the bison, the paws of the bear,\nand the head of the wild boar.\n\nWhen the pile of fagots had been thoroughly consumed, inside and\noutside, the hole, cleared of the cinders and hot coals, retained a very\nhigh temperature. The pieces of elephant-meat, surrounded with aromatic\nleaves, were placed in this extempore oven and covered with hot coals.\nThen Joe piled up a second heap of sticks over all, and when it had\nburned out the meat was cooked to a turn.\n\nThen Joe took the viands from the oven, spread the savory mess upon\ngreen leaves, and arranged his dinner upon a magnificent patch of\ngreensward. He finally brought out some biscuit, some coffee, and some\ncognac, and got a can of pure, fresh water from a neighboring streamlet.\n\nThe repast thus prepared was a pleasant sight to behold, and Joe,\nwithout being too proud, thought that it would also be pleasant to eat.\n\n\"A journey without danger or fatigue,\" he soliloquized; \"your meals when\nyou please; a swinging hammock all the time! What more could a man ask?\nAnd there was Kennedy, who didn't want to come!\"\n\nOn his part, Dr. Ferguson was engrossed in a serious and thorough\nexamination of the balloon. The latter did not appear to have suffered\nfrom the storm; the silk and the gutta percha had resisted wonderfully,\nand, upon estimating the exact height of the ground and the ascensional\nforce of the balloon, our aeronaut saw, with satisfaction, that the\nhydrogen was in exactly the same quantity as before. The covering had\nremained completely waterproof.\n\nIt was now only five days since our travellers had quitted Zanzibar;\ntheir pemmican had not yet been touched; their stock of biscuit and\npotted meat was enough for a long trip, and there was nothing to be\nreplenished but the water.\n\nThe pipes and spiral seemed to be in perfect condition, since, thanks to\ntheir india-rubber jointings, they had yielded to all the oscillations\nof the balloon. His examination ended, the doctor betook himself to\nsetting his notes in order. He made a very accurate sketch of the\nsurrounding landscape, with its long prairie stretching away out of\nsight, the forest of calmadores, and the balloon resting motionless over\nthe body of the dead elephant.\n\nAt the end of his two hours, Kennedy returned with a string of fat\npartridges and the haunch of an oryx, a sort of gemsbok belonging to the\nmost agile species of antelopes. Joe took upon himself to prepare this\nsurplus stock of provisions for a later repast.\n\n\"But, dinner's ready!\" he shouted in his most musical voice.\n\nAnd the three travellers had only to sit down on the green turf. The\ntrunk and feet of the elephant were declared to be exquisite. Old\nEngland was toasted, as usual, and delicious Havanas perfumed this\ncharming country for the first time.\n\nKennedy ate, drank, and chatted, like four; he was perfectly delighted\nwith his new life, and seriously proposed to the doctor to settle in\nthis forest, to construct a cabin of boughs and foliage, and, there and\nthen, to lay the foundation of a Robinson Crusoe dynasty in Africa.\n\nThe proposition went no further, although Joe had, at once, selected the\npart of Man Friday for himself.\n\nThe country seemed so quiet, so deserted, that the doctor resolved to\npass the night on the ground, and Joe arranged a circle of watch-fires\nas an indispensable barrier against wild animals, for the hyenas,\ncougars, and jackals, attracted by the smell of the dead elephant,\nwere prowling about in the neighborhood. Kennedy had to fire his rifle\nseveral times at these unceremonious visitors, but the night passed\nwithout any untoward occurrence.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHTEENTH.\n\nThe Karagwah.--Lake Ukereoue.--A Night on an Island.--The\nEquator.--Crossing the Lake.--The Cascades.--A View of the Country.--The\nSources of the Nile.--The Island of Benga.--The Signature of Andrea\nDebono.--The Flag with the Arms of England.\n\nAt five o'clock in the morning, preparations for departure commenced.\nJoe, with the hatchet which he had fortunately recovered, broke the\nelephant's tusks. The balloon, restored to liberty, sped away to the\nnorthwest with our travellers, at the rate of eighteen miles per hour.\n\nThe doctor had carefully taken his position by the altitude of the\nstars, during the preceding night. He knew that he was in latitude two\ndegrees forty minutes below the equator, or at a distance of one hundred\nand sixty geographical miles. He swept along over many villages without\nheeding the cries that the appearance of the balloon excited; he took\nnote of the conformation of places with quick sights; he passed the\nslopes of the Rubemhe, which are nearly as abrupt as the summits of the\nOusagara, and, farther on, at Tenga, encountered the first projections\nof the Karagwah chains, which, in his opinion, are direct spurs of the\nMountains of the Moon. So, the ancient legend which made these mountains\nthe cradle of the Nile, came near to the truth, since they really border\nupon Lake Ukereoue, the conjectured reservoir of the waters of the great\nriver.\n\nFrom Kafuro, the main district of the merchants of that country, he\ndescried, at length, on the horizon, the lake so much desired and so\nlong sought for, of which Captain Speke caught a glimpse on the 3d of\nAugust, 1858.\n\nSamuel Ferguson felt real emotion: he was almost in contact with one\nof the principal points of his expedition, and, with his spy-glass\nconstantly raised, he kept every nook and corner of the mysterious\nregion in sight. His gaze wandered over details that might have been\nthus described:\n\n\"Beneath him extended a country generally destitute of cultivation; only\nhere and there some ravines seemed under tillage; the surface, dotted\nwith peaks of medium height, grew flat as it approached the lake;\nbarley-fields took the place of rice-plantations, and there, too, could\nbe seen growing the species of plantain from which the wine of the\ncountry is drawn, and mwani, the wild plant which supplies a substitute\nfor coffee. A collection of some fifty or more circular huts, covered\nwith a flowering thatch, constituted the capital of the Karagwah\ncountry.\"\n\nHe could easily distinguish the astonished countenances of a rather\nfine-looking race of natives of yellowish-brown complexion. Women\nof incredible corpulence were dawdling about through the cultivated\ngrounds, and the doctor greatly surprised his companions by informing\nthem that this rotundity, which is highly esteemed in that region, was\nobtained by an obligatory diet of curdled milk.\n\nAt noon, the Victoria was in one degree forty-five minutes south\nlatitude, and at one o'clock the wind was driving her directly toward\nthe lake.\n\nThis sheet of water was christened Uyanza Victoria, or Victoria Lake, by\nCaptain Speke. At the place now mentioned it might measure about ninety\nmiles in breadth, and at its southern extremity the captain found a\ngroup of islets, which he named the Archipelago of Bengal. He pushed his\nsurvey as far as Muanza, on the eastern coast, where he was received\nby the sultan. He made a triangulation of this part of the lake, but\nhe could not procure a boat, either to cross it or to visit the great\nisland of Ukereoue which is very populous, is governed by three sultans,\nand appears to be only a promontory at low tide.\n\nThe balloon approached the lake more to the northward, to the doctor's\ngreat regret, for it had been his wish to determine its lower outlines.\nIts shores seemed to be thickly set with brambles and thorny plants,\ngrowing together in wild confusion, and were literally hidden,\nsometimes, from the gaze, by myriads of mosquitoes of a light-brown hue.\nThe country was evidently habitable and inhabited. Troops of hippopotami\ncould be seen disporting themselves in the forests of reeds, or plunging\nbeneath the whitish waters of the lake.\n\nThe latter, seen from above, presented, toward the west, so broad an\nhorizon that it might have been called a sea; the distance between the\ntwo shores is so great that communication cannot be established, and\nstorms are frequent and violent, for the winds sweep with fury over this\nelevated and unsheltered basin.\n\nThe doctor experienced some difficulty in guiding his course; he was\nafraid of being carried toward the east, but, fortunately, a current\nbore him directly toward the north, and at six o'clock in the evening\nthe balloon alighted on a small desert island in thirty minutes south\nlatitude, and thirty-two degrees fifty-two minutes east longitude, about\ntwenty miles from the shore.\n\nThe travellers succeeded in making fast to a tree, and, the wind having\nfallen calm toward evening, they remained quietly at anchor. They dared\nnot dream of taking the ground, since here, as on the shores of the\nUyanza, legions of mosquitoes covered the soil in dense clouds. Joe even\ncame back, from securing the anchor in the tree, speckled with bites,\nbut he kept his temper, because he found it quite the natural thing for\nmosquitoes to treat him as they had done.\n\nNevertheless, the doctor, who was less of an optimist, let out as much\nrope as he could, so as to escape these pitiless insects, that began to\nrise toward him with a threatening hum.\n\nThe doctor ascertained the height of the lake above the level of the\nsea, as it had been determined by Captain Speke, say three thousand\nseven hundred and fifty feet.\n\n\"Here we are, then, on an island!\" said Joe, scratching as though he'd\ntear his nails out.\n\n\"We could make the tour of it in a jiffy,\" added Kennedy, \"and,\nexcepting these confounded mosquitoes, there's not a living being to be\nseen on it.\"\n\n\"The islands with which the lake is dotted,\" replied the doctor, \"are\nnothing, after all, but the tops of submerged hills; but we are lucky\nto have found a retreat among them, for the shores of the lake are\ninhabited by ferocious tribes. Take your sleep, then, since Providence\nhas granted us a tranquil night.\"\n\n\"Won't you do the same, doctor?\"\n\n\"No, I could not close my eyes. My thoughts would banish sleep.\nTo-morrow, my friends, should the wind prove favorable, we shall go due\nnorth, and we shall, perhaps, discover the sources of the Nile, that\ngrand secret which has so long remained impenetrable. Near as we are to\nthe sources of the renowned river, I could not sleep.\"\n\nKennedy and Joe, whom scientific speculations failed to disturb to that\nextent, were not long in falling into sound slumber, while the doctor\nheld his post.\n\nOn Wednesday, April 23d, the balloon started at four o'clock in the\nmorning, with a grayish sky overhead; night was slow in quitting the\nsurface of the lake, which was enveloped in a dense fog, but presently a\nviolent breeze scattered all the mists, and, after the balloon had been\nswung to and fro for a moment, in opposite directions, it at length\nveered in a straight line toward the north.\n\nDr. Ferguson fairly clapped his hands for joy.\n\n\"We are on the right track!\" he exclaimed. \"To-day or never we shall see\nthe Nile! Look, my friends, we are crossing the equator! We are entering\nour own hemisphere!\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Joe, \"do you think, doctor, that the equator passes here?\"\n\n\"Just here, my boy!\"\n\n\"Well, then, with all respect to you, sir, it seems to me that this is\nthe very time to moisten it.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said the doctor, laughing. \"Let us have a glass of punch. You\nhave a way of comprehending cosmography that is any thing but dull.\"\n\nAnd thus was the passage of the Victoria over the equator duly\ncelebrated.\n\nThe balloon made rapid headway. In the west could be seen a low and but\nslightly-diversified coast, and, farther away in the background, the\nelevated plains of the Uganda and the Usoga. At length, the rapidity of\nthe wind became excessive, approaching thirty miles per hour.\n\nThe waters of the Nyanza, violently agitated, were foaming like the\nbillows of a sea. By the appearance of certain long swells that followed\nthe sinking of the waves, the doctor was enabled to conclude that the\nlake must have great depth of water. Only one or two rude boats were\nseen during this rapid passage.\n\n\"This lake is evidently, from its elevated position, the natural\nreservoir of the rivers in the eastern part of Africa, and the sky gives\nback to it in rain what it takes in vapor from the streams that flow out\nof it. I am certain that the Nile must here take its rise.\"\n\n\"Well, we shall see!\" said Kennedy.\n\nAbout nine o'clock they drew nearer to the western coast. It seemed\ndeserted, and covered with woods; the wind freshened a little toward the\neast, and the other shore of the lake could be seen. It bent around in\nsuch a curve as to end in a wide angle toward two degrees forty minutes\nnorth latitude. Lofty mountains uplifted their arid peaks at this\nextremity of Nyanza; but, between them, a deep and winding gorge gave\nexit to a turbulent and foaming river.\n\nWhile busy managing the balloon, Dr. Ferguson never ceased reconnoitring\nthe country with eager eyes.\n\n\"Look!\" he exclaimed, \"look, my friends! the statements of the Arabs\nwere correct! They spoke of a river by which Lake Ukereoue discharged\nits waters toward the north, and this river exists, and we are\ndescending it, and it flows with a speed analogous to our own! And this\ndrop of water now gliding away beneath our feet is, beyond all question,\nrushing on, to mingle with the Mediterranean! It is the Nile!\"\n\n\"It is the Nile!\" reeechoed Kennedy, carried away by the enthusiasm of\nhis friend.\n\n\"Hurrah for the Nile!\" shouted Joe, glad, and always ready to cheer for\nsomething.\n\nEnormous rocks, here and there, embarrassed the course of this\nmysterious river. The water foamed as it fell in rapids and cataracts,\nwhich confirmed the doctor in his preconceived ideas on the subject.\nFrom the environing mountains numerous torrents came plunging and\nseething down, and the eye could take them in by hundreds. There could\nbe seen, starting from the soil, delicate jets of water scattering in\nall directions, crossing and recrossing each other, mingling, contending\nin the swiftness of their progress, and all rushing toward that nascent\nstream which became a river after having drunk them in.\n\n\"Here is, indeed, the Nile!\" reiterated the doctor, with the tone of\nprofound conviction. \"The origin of its name, like the origin of its\nwaters, has fired the imagination of the learned; they have sought to\ntrace it from the Greek, the Coptic, the Sanscrit; but all that matters\nlittle now, since we have made it surrender the secret of its source!\"\n\n\"But,\" said the Scotchman, \"how are you to make sure of the identity of\nthis river with the one recognized by the travellers from the north?\"\n\n\"We shall have certain, irrefutable, convincing, and infallible proof,\"\nreplied Ferguson, \"should the wind hold another hour in our favor!\"\n\nThe mountains drew farther apart, revealing in their place numerous\nvillages, and fields of white Indian corn, doura, and sugar-cane. The\ntribes inhabiting the region seemed excited and hostile; they manifested\nmore anger than adoration, and evidently saw in the aeronauts only\nobtrusive strangers, and not condescending deities. It appeared as\nthough, in approaching the sources of the Nile, these men came to rob\nthem of something, and so the Victoria had to keep out of range of their\nmuskets.\n\n\"To land here would be a ticklish matter!\" said the Scot.\n\n\"Well!\" said Joe, \"so much the worse for these natives. They'll have to\ndo without the pleasure of our conversation.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, descend I must,\" said the doctor, \"were it only for a\nquarter of an hour. Without doing so I cannot verify the results of our\nexpedition.\"\n\n\"It is indispensable, then, doctor?\"\n\n\"Indispensable; and we will descend, even if we have to do so with a\nvolley of musketry.\"\n\n\"The thing suits me,\" said Kennedy, toying with his pet rifle.\n\n\"And I'm ready, master, whenever you say the word!\" added Joe, preparing\nfor the fight.\n\n\"It would not be the first time,\" remarked the doctor, \"that science\nhas been followed up, sword in hand. The same thing happened to a\nFrench savant among the mountains of Spain, when he was measuring the\nterrestrial meridian.\"\n\n\"Be easy on that score, doctor, and trust to your two body-guards.\"\n\n\"Are we there, master?\"\n\n\"Not yet. In fact, I shall go up a little, first, in order to get an\nexact idea of the configuration of the country.\"\n\nThe hydrogen expanded, and in less than ten minutes the balloon was\nsoaring at a height of twenty-five hundred feet above the ground.\n\nFrom that elevation could be distinguished an inextricable network of\nsmaller streams which the river received into its bosom; others came\nfrom the west, from between numerous hills, in the midst of fertile\nplains.\n\n\"We are not ninety miles from Gondokoro,\" said the doctor, measuring\noff the distance on his map, \"and less than five miles from the point\nreached by the explorers from the north. Let us descend with great\ncare.\"\n\nAnd, upon this, the balloon was lowered about two thousand feet.\n\n\"Now, my friends, let us be ready, come what may.\"\n\n\"Ready it is!\" said Dick and Joe, with one voice.\n\n\"Good!\"\n\nIn a few moments the balloon was advancing along the bed of the river,\nand scarcely one hundred feet above the ground. The Nile measured but\nfifty fathoms in width at this point, and the natives were in great\nexcitement, rushing to and fro, tumultuously, in the villages that lined\nthe banks of the stream. At the second degree it forms a perpendicular\ncascade of ten feet in height, and consequently impassable by boats.\n\n\"Here, then, is the cascade mentioned by Debono!\" exclaimed the doctor.\n\nThe basin of the river spread out, dotted with numerous islands, which\nDr. Ferguson devoured with his eyes. He seemed to be seeking for a point\nof reference which he had not yet found.\n\nBy this time, some blacks, having ventured in a boat just under the\nballoon, Kennedy saluted them with a shot from his rifle, that made them\nregain the bank at their utmost speed.\n\n\"A good journey to you,\" bawled Joe, \"and if I were in your place, I\nwouldn't try coming back again. I should be mightily afraid of a monster\nthat can hurl thunderbolts when he pleases.\"\n\nBut, all at once, the doctor snatched up his spy-glass, and directed it\ntoward an island reposing in the middle of the river.\n\n\"Four trees!\" he exclaimed; \"look, down there!\" Sure enough, there were\nfour trees standing alone at one end of it.\n\n\"It is Bengal Island! It is the very same,\" repeated the doctor,\nexultingly.\n\n\"And what of that?\" asked Dick.\n\n\"It is there that we shall alight, if God permits.\"\n\n\"But, it seems to be inhabited, doctor.\"\n\n\"Joe is right; and, unless I'm mistaken, there is a group of about a\nscore of natives on it now.\"\n\n\"We'll make them scatter; there'll be no great trouble in that,\"\nresponded Ferguson.\n\n\"So be it,\" chimed in the hunter.\n\nThe sun was at the zenith as the balloon approached the island.\n\nThe blacks, who were members of the Makado tribe, were howling lustily,\nand one of them waved his bark hat in the air. Kennedy took aim at\nhim, fired, and his hat flew about him in pieces. Thereupon there was a\ngeneral scamper. The natives plunged headlong into the river, and swam\nto the opposite bank. Immediately, there came a shower of balls from\nboth banks, along with a perfect cloud of arrows, but without doing the\nballoon any damage, where it rested with its anchor snugly secured in\nthe fissure of a rock. Joe lost no time in sliding to the ground.\n\n\"The ladder!\" cried the doctor. \"Follow me, Kennedy.\"\n\n\"What do you wish, sir?\"\n\n\"Let us alight. I want a witness.\"\n\n\"Here I am!\"\n\n\"Mind your post, Joe, and keep a good lookout.\"\n\n\"Never fear, doctor; I'll answer for all that.\"\n\n\"Come, Dick,\" said the doctor, as he touched the ground.\n\nSo saying, he drew his companion along toward a group of rocks that rose\nupon one point of the island; there, after searching for some time, he\nbegan to rummage among the brambles, and, in so doing, scratched his\nhands until they bled.\n\nSuddenly he grasped Kennedy's arm, exclaiming: \"Look! look!\"\n\n\"Letters!\"\n\nYes; there, indeed, could be descried, with perfect precision of\noutline, some letters carved on the rock. It was quite easy to make them\nout:\n\n\"A. D.\"\n\n\"A.D.!\" repeated Dr. Ferguson. \"Andrea Debono--the very signature of the\ntraveller who farthest ascended the current of the Nile.\"\n\n\"No doubt of that, friend Samuel,\" assented Kennedy.\n\n\"Are you now convinced?\"\n\n\"It is the Nile! We cannot entertain a doubt on that score now,\" was the\nreply.\n\nThe doctor, for the last time, examined those precious initials, the\nexact form and size of which he carefully noted.\n\n\"And now,\" said he--\"now for the balloon!\"\n\n\"Quickly, then, for I see some of the natives getting ready to recross\nthe river.\"\n\n\"That matters little to us now. Let the wind but send us northward for a\nfew hours, and we shall reach Gondokoro, and press the hands of some of\nour countrymen.\"\n\nTen minutes more, and the balloon was majestically ascending, while Dr.\nFerguson, in token of success, waved the English flag triumphantly from\nhis car.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINETEENTH.\n\nThe Nile.--The Trembling Mountain.--A Remembrance of the\nCountry.--The Narratives of the Arabs.--The Nyam-Nyams.--Joe's\nShrewd Cogitations.--The Balloon runs the Gantlet.--Aerostatic\nAscensions.--Madame Blanchard.\n\n\"Which way do we head?\" asked Kennedy, as he saw his friend consulting\nthe compass.\n\n\"North-northeast.\"\n\n\"The deuce! but that's not the north?\"\n\n\"No, Dick; and I'm afraid that we shall have some trouble in getting\nto Gondokoro. I am sorry for it; but, at last, we have succeeded in\nconnecting the explorations from the east with those from the north; and\nwe must not complain.\"\n\nThe balloon was now receding gradually from the Nile.\n\n\"One last look,\" said the doctor, \"at this impassable latitude, beyond\nwhich the most intrepid travellers could not make their way. There are\nthose intractable tribes, of whom Petherick, Arnaud, Miuni, and the\nyoung traveller Lejean, to whom we are indebted for the best work on the\nUpper Nile, have spoken.\"\n\n\"Thus, then,\" added Kennedy, inquiringly, \"our discoveries agree with\nthe speculations of science.\"\n\n\"Absolutely so. The sources of the White Nile, of the Bahr-el-Abiad,\nare immersed in a lake as large as a sea; it is there that it takes its\nrise. Poesy, undoubtedly, loses something thereby. People were fond of\nascribing a celestial origin to this king of rivers. The ancients gave\nit the name of an ocean, and were not far from believing that it flowed\ndirectly from the sun; but we must come down from these flights from\ntime to time, and accept what science teaches us. There will not always\nbe scientific men, perhaps; but there always will be poets.\"\n\n\"We can still see cataracts,\" said Joe.\n\n\"Those are the cataracts of Makedo, in the third degree of latitude.\nNothing could be more accurate. Oh, if we could only have followed the\ncourse of the Nile for a few hours!\"\n\n\"And down yonder, below us, I see the top of a mountain,\" said the\nhunter.\n\n\"That is Mount Longwek, the Trembling Mountain of the Arabs. This whole\ncountry was visited by Debono, who went through it under the name of\nLatif-Effendi. The tribes living near the Nile are hostile to each\nother, and are continually waging a war of extermination. You may form\nsome idea, then, of the difficulties he had to encounter.\"\n\nThe wind was carrying the balloon toward the northwest, and, in order to\navoid Mount Longwek, it was necessary to seek a more slanting current.\n\n\"My friends,\" said the doctor, \"here is where OUR passage of the African\nContinent really commences; up to this time we have been following the\ntraces of our predecessors. Henceforth we are to launch ourselves upon\nthe unknown. We shall not lack the courage, shall we?\"\n\n\"Never!\" said Dick and Joe together, almost in a shout.\n\n\"Onward, then, and may we have the help of Heaven!\"\n\nAt ten o'clock at night, after passing over ravines, forests, and\nscattered villages, the aeronauts reached the side of the Trembling\nMountain, along whose gentle slopes they went quietly gliding. In that\nmemorable day, the 23d of April, they had, in fifteen hours, impelled\nby a rapid breeze, traversed a distance of more than three hundred and\nfifteen miles.\n\nBut this latter part of the journey had left them in dull spirits, and\ncomplete silence reigned in the car. Was Dr. Ferguson absorbed in the\nthought of his discoveries? Were his two companions thinking of their\ntrip through those unknown regions? There were, no doubt, mingled\nwith these reflections, the keenest reminiscences of home and distant\nfriends. Joe alone continued to manifest the same careless philosophy,\nfinding it QUITE NATURAL that home should not be there, from the moment\nthat he left it; but he respected the silent mood of his friends, the\ndoctor and Kennedy.\n\nAbout ten the balloon anchored on the side of the Trembling Mountain,\nso called, because, in Arab tradition, it is said to tremble the instant\nthat a Mussulman sets foot upon it. The travellers then partook of a\nsubstantial meal, and all quietly passed the night as usual, keeping the\nregular watches.\n\nOn awaking the next morning, they all had pleasanter feelings. The\nweather was fine, and the wind was blowing from the right quarter; so\nthat a good breakfast, seasoned with Joe's merry pranks, put them in\nhigh good-humor.\n\nThe region they were now crossing is very extensive. It borders on the\nMountains of the Moon on one side, and those of Darfur on the other--a\nspace about as broad as Europe.\n\n\"We are, no doubt, crossing what is supposed to be the kingdom of Usoga.\nGeographers have pretended that there existed, in the centre of Africa,\na vast depression, an immense central lake. We shall see whether there\nis any truth in that idea,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"But how did they come to think so?\" asked Kennedy.\n\n\"From the recitals of the Arabs. Those fellows are great narrators--too\nmuch so, probably. Some travellers, who had got as far as Kazeh, or\nthe great lakes, saw slaves that had been brought from this region;\ninterrogated them concerning it, and, from their different narratives,\nmade up a jumble of notions, and deduced systems from them. Down at the\nbottom of it all there is some appearance of truth; and you see that\nthey were right about the sources of the Nile.\"\n\n\"Nothing could be more correct,\" said Kennedy. \"It was by the aid of\nthese documents that some attempts at maps were made, and so I am going\nto try to follow our route by one of them, rectifying it when need be.\"\n\n\"Is all this region inhabited?\" asked Joe.\n\n\"Undoubtedly; and disagreeably inhabited, too.\"\n\n\"I thought so.\"\n\n\"These scattered tribes come, one and all, under the title of\nNyam-Nyams, and this compound word is only a sort of nickname. It\nimitates the sound of chewing.\"\n\n\"That's it! Excellent!\" said Joe, champing his teeth as though he were\neating; \"Nyam-Nyam.\"\n\n\"My good Joe, if you were the immediate object of this chewing, you\nwouldn't find it so excellent.\"\n\n\"Why, what's the reason, sir?\"\n\n\"These tribes are considered man-eaters.\"\n\n\"Is that really the case?\"\n\n\"Not a doubt of it! It has also been asserted that these natives had\ntails, like mere quadrupeds; but it was soon discovered that these\nappendages belonged to the skins of animals that they wore for\nclothing.\"\n\n\"More's the pity! a tail's a nice thing to chase away mosquitoes.\"\n\n\"That may be, Joe; but we must consign the story to the domain of fable,\nlike the dogs' heads which the traveller, Brun-Rollet, attributed to\nother tribes.\"\n\n\"Dogs' heads, eh? Quite convenient for barking, and even for\nman-eating!\"\n\n\"But one thing that has been, unfortunately, proven true, is, the\nferocity of these tribes, who are really very fond of human flesh, and\ndevour it with avidity.\"\n\n\"I only hope that they won't take such a particular fancy to mine!\" said\nJoe, with comic solemnity.\n\n\"See that!\" said Kennedy.\n\n\"Yes, indeed, sir; if I have to be eaten, in a moment of famine, I want\nit to be for your benefit and my master's; but the idea of feeding those\nblack fellows--gracious! I'd die of shame!\"\n\n\"Well, then, Joe,\" said Kennedy, \"that's understood; we count upon you\nin case of need!\"\n\n\"At your service, gentlemen!\"\n\n\"Joe talks in this way so as to make us take good care of him, and\nfatten him up.\"\n\n\"Maybe so!\" said Joe. \"Every man for himself.\"\n\nIn the afternoon, the sky became covered with a warm mist, that oozed\nfrom the soil; the brownish vapor scarcely allowed the beholder to\ndistinguish objects, and so, fearing collision with some unexpected\nmountain-peak, the doctor, about five o'clock, gave the signal to halt.\n\nThe night passed without accident, but in such profound obscurity, that\nit was necessary to use redoubled vigilance.\n\nThe monsoon blew with extreme violence during all the next morning. The\nwind buried itself in the lower cavities of the balloon and shook the\nappendage by which the dilating-pipes entered the main apparatus. They\nhad, at last, to be tied up with cords, Joe acquitting himself very\nskilfully in performing that operation.\n\nHe had occasion to observe, at the same time, that the orifice of the\nballoon still remained hermetically sealed.\n\n\"That is a matter of double importance for us,\" said the doctor; \"in the\nfirst place, we avoid the escape of precious gas, and then, again, we\ndo not leave behind us an inflammable train, which we should at last\ninevitably set fire to, and so be consumed.\"\n\n\"That would be a disagreeable travelling incident!\" said Joe.\n\n\"Should we be hurled to the ground?\" asked Kennedy.\n\n\"Hurled! No, not quite that. The gas would burn quietly, and we should\ndescend little by little. A similar accident happened to a French\naeronaut, Madame Blanchard. She ignited her balloon while sending off\nfireworks, but she did not fall, and she would not have been killed,\nprobably, had not her car dashed against a chimney and precipitated her\nto the ground.\"\n\n\"Let us hope that nothing of the kind may happen to us,\" said the\nhunter. \"Up to this time our trip has not seemed to me very dangerous,\nand I can see nothing to prevent us reaching our destination.\"\n\n\"Nor can I either, my dear Dick; accidents are generally caused by the\nimprudence of the aeronauts, or the defective construction of their\napparatus. However, in thousands of aerial ascensions, there have not\nbeen twenty fatal accidents. Usually, the danger is in the moment of\nleaving the ground, or of alighting, and therefore at those junctures we\nshould never omit the utmost precaution.\"\n\n\"It's breakfast-time,\" said Joe; \"we'll have to put up with preserved\nmeat and coffee until Mr. Kennedy has had another chance to get us a\ngood slice of venison.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTIETH.\n\nThe Celestial Bottle.--The Fig-Palms.--The Mammoth Trees.--The Tree of\nWar.--The Winged Team.--Two Native Tribes in Battle.--A Massacre.--An\nIntervention from above.\n\nThe wind had become violent and irregular; the balloon was running\nthe gantlet through the air. Tossed at one moment toward the north, at\nanother toward the south, it could not find one steady current.\n\n\"We are moving very swiftly without advancing much,\" said Kennedy,\nremarking the frequent oscillations of the needle of the compass.\n\n\"The balloon is rushing at the rate of at least thirty miles an hour.\nLean over, and see how the country is gliding away beneath us!\" said the\ndoctor.\n\n\"See! that forest looks as though it were precipitating itself upon us!\"\n\n\"The forest has become a clearing!\" added the other.\n\n\"And the clearing a village!\" continued Joe, a moment or two later.\n\"Look at the faces of those astonished darkys!\"\n\n\"Oh! it's natural enough that they should be astonished,\" said the\ndoctor. \"The French peasants, when they first saw a balloon, fired\nat it, thinking that it was an aerial monster. A Soudan negro may be\nexcused, then, for opening his eyes VERY wide!\"\n\n\"Faith!\" said Joe, as the Victoria skimmed closely along the ground,\nat scarcely the elevation of one hundred feet, and immediately over a\nvillage, \"I'll throw them an empty bottle, with your leave, doctor, and\nif it reaches them safe and sound, they'll worship it; if it breaks,\nthey'll make talismans of the pieces.\"\n\nSo saying, he flung out a bottle, which, of course, was broken into a\nthousand fragments, while the negroes scampered into their round huts,\nuttering shrill cries.\n\nA little farther on, Kennedy called out: \"Look at that strange tree! The\nupper part is of one kind and the lower part of another!\"\n\n\"Well!\" said Joe, \"here's a country where the trees grow on top of each\nother.\"\n\n\"It's simply the trunk of a fig-tree,\" replied the doctor, \"on which\nthere is a little vegetating earth. Some fine day, the wind left the\nseed of a palm on it, and the seed has taken root and grown as though it\nwere on the plain ground.\"\n\n\"A fine new style of gardening,\" said Joe, \"and I'll import the idea\nto England. It would be just the thing in the London parks; without\ncounting that it would be another way to increase the number of\nfruit-trees. We could have gardens up in the air; and the small\nhouse-owners would like that!\"\n\nAt this moment, they had to raise the balloon so as to pass over a\nforest of trees that were more than three hundred feet in height--a kind\nof ancient banyan.\n\n\"What magnificent trees!\" exclaimed Kennedy. \"I never saw any thing so\nfine as the appearance of these venerable forests. Look, doctor!\"\n\n\"The height of these banyans is really remarkable, my dear Dick; and\nyet, they would be nothing astonishing in the New World.\"\n\n\"Why, are there still loftier trees in existence?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly; among the 'mammoth trees' of California, there is a cedar\nfour hundred and eighty feet in height. It would overtop the Houses\nof Parliament, and even the Great Pyramid of Egypt. The trunk at the\nsurface of the ground was one hundred and twenty feet in circumference,\nand the concentric layers of the wood disclosed an age of more than four\nthousand years.\"\n\n\"But then, sir, there was nothing wonderful in it! When one has lived\nfour thousand years, one ought to be pretty tall!\" was Joe's remark.\n\nMeanwhile, during the doctor's recital and Joe's response, the forest\nhad given place to a large collection of huts surrounding an open space.\nIn the middle of this grew a solitary tree, and Joe exclaimed, as he\ncaught sight of it:\n\n\"Well! if that tree has produced such flowers as those, for the last\nfour thousand years, I have to offer it my compliments, anyhow,\" and he\npointed to a gigantic sycamore, whose whole trunk was covered with human\nbones. The flowers of which Joe spoke were heads freshly severed from\nthe bodies, and suspended by daggers thrust into the bark of the tree.\n\n\"The war-tree of these cannibals!\" said the doctor; \"the Indians merely\ncarry off the scalp, but these negroes take the whole head.\"\n\n\"A mere matter of fashion!\" said Joe. But, already, the village and the\nbleeding heads were disappearing on the horizon. Another place offered\na still more revolting spectacle--half-devoured corpses; skeletons\nmouldering to dust; human limbs scattered here and there, and left to\nfeed the jackals and hyenas.\n\n\"No doubt, these are the bodies of criminals; according to the custom\nin Abyssinia, these people have left them a prey to the wild beasts, who\nkill them with their terrible teeth and claws, and then devour them at\ntheir leisure.\n\n\"Not a whit more cruel than hanging!\" said the Scot; \"filthier, that's\nall!\"\n\n\"In the southern regions of Africa, they content themselves,\" resumed\nthe doctor, \"with shutting up the criminal in his own hut with his\ncattle, and sometimes with his family. They then set fire to the hut,\nand the whole party are burned together. I call that cruel; but, like\nfriend Kennedy, I think that the gallows is quite as cruel, quite as\nbarbarous.\"\n\nJoe, by the aid of his keen sight, which he did not fail to use\ncontinually, noticed some flocks of birds of prey flitting about the\nhorizon.\n\n\"They are eagles!\" exclaimed Kennedy, after reconnoitring them through\nthe glass, \"magnificent birds, whose flight is as rapid as ours.\"\n\n\"Heaven preserve us from their attacks!\" said the doctor, \"they are more\nto be feared by us than wild beasts or savage tribes.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said the hunter, \"we can drive them off with a few rifle-shots.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, I would prefer, dear Dick, not having to rely upon your\nskill, this time, for the silk of our balloon could not resist their\nsharp beaks; fortunately, the huge birds will, I believe, be more\nfrightened than attracted by our machine.\"\n\n\"Yes! but a new idea, and I have dozens of them,\" said Joe; \"if we could\nonly manage to capture a team of live eagles, we could hitch them to the\nballoon, and they'd haul us through the air!\"\n\n\"The thing has been seriously proposed,\" replied the doctor, \"but I\nthink it hardly practicable with creatures naturally so restive.\"\n\n\"Oh! we'd tame them,\" said Joe. \"Instead of driving them with bits, we'd\ndo it with eye-blinkers that would cover their eyes. Half blinded in\nthat way, they'd go to the right or to the left, as we desired; when\nblinded completely, they would stop.\"\n\n\"Allow me, Joe, to prefer a favorable wind to your team of eagles. It\ncosts less for fodder, and is more reliable.\"\n\n\"Well, you may have your choice, master, but I stick to my idea.\"\n\nIt now was noon. The Victoria had been going at a more moderate speed\nfor some time; the country merely passed below it; it no longer flew.\n\nSuddenly, shouts and whistlings were heard by our aeronauts, and,\nleaning over the edge of the car, they saw on the open plain below them\nan exciting spectacle.\n\nTwo hostile tribes were fighting furiously, and the air was dotted with\nvolleys of arrows. The combatants were so intent upon their murderous\nwork that they did not notice the arrival of the balloon; there were\nabout three hundred mingled confusedly in the deadly struggle: most of\nthem, red with the blood of the wounded, in which they fairly wallowed,\nwere horrible to behold.\n\nAs they at last caught sight of the balloon, there was a momentary\npause; but their yells redoubled, and some arrows were shot at the\nVictoria, one of them coming close enough for Joe to catch it with his\nhand.\n\n\"Let us rise out of range,\" exclaimed the doctor; \"there must be no\nrashness! We are forbidden any risk.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the massacre continued on both sides, with battle-axes and\nwar-clubs; as quickly as one of the combatants fell, a hostile warrior\nran up to cut off his head, while the women, mingling in the fray,\ngathered up these bloody trophies, and piled them together at either\nextremity of the battle-field. Often, too, they even fought for these\nhideous spoils.\n\n\"What a frightful scene!\" said Kennedy, with profound disgust.\n\n\"They're ugly acquaintances!\" added Joe; \"but then, if they had uniforms\nthey'd be just like the fighters of all the rest of the world!\"\n\n\"I have a keen hankering to take a hand in at that fight,\" said the\nhunter, brandishing his rifle.\n\n\"No! no!\" objected the doctor, vehemently; \"no, let us not meddle with\nwhat don't concern us. Do you know which is right or which is wrong,\nthat you would assume the part of the Almighty? Let us, rather, hurry\naway from this revolting spectacle. Could the great captains of the\nworld float thus above the scenes of their exploits, they would at last,\nperhaps, conceive a disgust for blood and conquest.\"\n\nThe chieftain of one of the contending parties was remarkable for his\nathletic proportions, his great height, and herculean strength. With\none hand he plunged his spear into the compact ranks of his enemies, and\nwith the other mowed large spaces in them with his battle-axe. Suddenly\nhe flung away his war-club, red with blood, rushed upon a wounded\nwarrior, and, chopping off his arm at a single stroke, carried the\ndissevered member to his mouth, and bit it again and again.\n\n\"Ah!\" ejaculated Kennedy, \"the horrible brute! I can hold back no\nlonger,\" and, as he spoke, the huge savage, struck full in the forehead\nwith a rifle-ball, fell headlong to the ground.\n\nUpon this sudden mishap of their leader, his warriors seemed struck dumb\nwith amazement; his supernatural death awed them, while it reanimated\nthe courage and ardor of their adversaries, and, in a twinkling, the\nfield was abandoned by half the combatants.\n\n\"Come, let us look higher up for a current to bear us away. I am sick of\nthis spectacle,\" said the doctor.\n\nBut they could not get away so rapidly as to avoid the sight of the\nvictorious tribe rushing upon the dead and the wounded, scrambling and\ndisputing for the still warm and reeking flesh, and eagerly devouring\nit.\n\n\"Faugh!\" uttered Joe, \"it's sickening.\"\n\nThe balloon rose as it expanded; the howlings of the brutal horde, in\nthe delirium of their orgy, pursued them for a few minutes; but, at\nlength, borne away toward the south, they were carried out of sight and\nhearing of this horrible spectacle of cannibalism.\n\nThe surface of the country was now greatly varied, with numerous streams\nof water, bearing toward the east. The latter, undoubtedly, ran into\nthose affluents of Lake Nu, or of the River of the Gazelles, concerning\nwhich M. Guillaume Lejean has given such curious details.\n\nAt nightfall, the balloon cast anchor in twenty-seven degrees east\nlongitude, and four degrees twenty minutes north latitude, after a day's\ntrip of one hundred and fifty miles.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FIRST.\n\nStrange Sounds.--A Night Attack.--Kennedy and Joe in the Tree.--Two\nShots.--\"Help! help!\"--Reply in French.--The Morning.--The\nMissionary.--The Plan of Rescue.\n\nThe night came on very dark. The doctor had not been able to reconnoitre\nthe country. He had made fast to a very tall tree, from which he could\ndistinguish only a confused mass through the gloom.\n\nAs usual, he took the nine-o'clock watch, and at midnight Dick relieved\nhim.\n\n\"Keep a sharp lookout, Dick!\" was the doctor's good-night injunction.\n\n\"Is there any thing new on the carpet?\"\n\n\"No; but I thought that I heard vague sounds below us, and, as I don't\nexactly know where the wind has carried us to, even an excess of caution\nwould do no harm.\"\n\n\"You've probably heard the cries of wild beasts.\"\n\n\"No! the sounds seemed to me something altogether different from that;\nat all events, on the least alarm don't fail to waken us.\"\n\n\"I'll do so, doctor; rest easy.\"\n\nAfter listening attentively for a moment or two longer, the doctor,\nhearing nothing more, threw himself on his blankets and went asleep.\n\nThe sky was covered with dense clouds, but not a breath of air was\nstirring; and the balloon, kept in its place by only a single anchor,\nexperienced not the slightest oscillation.\n\nKennedy, leaning his elbow on the edge of the car, so as to keep an eye\non the cylinder, which was actively at work, gazed out upon the calm\nobscurity; he eagerly scanned the horizon, and, as often happens to\nminds that are uneasy or possessed with preconceived notions, he fancied\nthat he sometimes detected vague gleams of light in the distance.\n\nAt one moment he even thought that he saw them only two hundred paces\naway, quite distinctly, but it was a mere flash that was gone as quickly\nas it came, and he noticed nothing more. It was, no doubt, one of those\nluminous illusions that sometimes impress the eye in the midst of very\nprofound darkness.\n\nKennedy was getting over his nervousness and falling into his wandering\nmeditations again, when a sharp whistle pierced his ear.\n\nWas that the cry of an animal or of a night-bird, or did it come from\nhuman lips?\n\nKennedy, perfectly comprehending the gravity of the situation, was on\nthe point of waking his companions, but he reflected that, in any case,\nmen or animals, the creatures that he had heard must be out of reach.\nSo he merely saw that his weapons were all right, and then, with his\nnight-glass, again plunged his gaze into space.\n\nIt was not long before he thought he could perceive below him vague\nforms that seemed to be gliding toward the tree, and then, by the aid of\na ray of moonlight that shot like an electric flash between two masses\nof cloud, he distinctly made out a group of human figures moving in the\nshadow.\n\nThe adventure with the dog-faced baboons returned to his memory, and he\nplaced his hand on the doctor's shoulder.\n\nThe latter was awake in a moment.\n\n\"Silence!\" said Dick. \"Let us speak below our breath.\"\n\n\"Has any thing happened?\"\n\n\"Yes, let us waken Joe.\"\n\nThe instant that Joe was aroused, Kennedy told him what he had seen.\n\n\"Those confounded monkeys again!\" said Joe.\n\n\"Possibly, but we must be on our guard.\"\n\n\"Joe and I,\" said Kennedy, \"will climb down the tree by the ladder.\"\n\n\"And, in the meanwhile,\" added the doctor, \"I will take my measures so\nthat we can ascend rapidly at a moment's warning.\"\n\n\"Agreed!\"\n\n\"Let us go down, then!\" said Joe.\n\n\"Don't use your weapons, excepting at the last extremity! It would be a\nuseless risk to make the natives aware of our presence in such a place\nas this.\"\n\nDick and Joe replied with signs of assent, and then letting themselves\nslide noiselessly toward the tree, took their position in a fork among\nthe strong branches where the anchor had caught.\n\nFor some moments they listened minutely and motionlessly among the\nfoliage, and ere long Joe seized Kenedy's hand as he heard a sort of\nrubbing sound against the bark of the tree.\n\n\"Don't you hear that?\" he whispered.\n\n\"Yes, and it's coming nearer.\"\n\n\"Suppose it should be a serpent? That hissing or whistling that you\nheard before--\"\n\n\"No! there was something human in it.\"\n\n\"I'd prefer the savages, for I have a horror of those snakes.\"\n\n\"The noise is increasing,\" said Kennedy, again, after a lapse of a few\nmoments.\n\n\"Yes! something's coming up toward us--climbing.\"\n\n\"Keep watch on this side, and I'll take care of the other.\"\n\n\"Very good!\"\n\nThere they were, isolated at the top of one of the larger branches\nshooting out in the midst of one of those miniature forests called\nbaobab-trees. The darkness, heightened by the density of the foliage,\nwas profound; however, Joe, leaning over to Kennedy's ear and pointing\ndown the tree, whispered:\n\n\"The blacks! They're climbing toward us.\"\n\nThe two friends could even catch the sound of a few words uttered in the\nlowest possible tones.\n\nJoe gently brought his rifle to his shoulder as he spoke.\n\n\"Wait!\" said Kennedy.\n\nSome of the natives had really climbed the baobab, and now they were\nseen rising on all sides, winding along the boughs like reptiles, and\nadvancing slowly but surely, all the time plainly enough discernible,\nnot merely to the eye but to the nostrils, by the horrible odors of the\nrancid grease with which they bedaub their bodies.\n\nEre long, two heads appeared to the gaze of Kennedy and Joe, on a level\nwith the very branch to which they were clinging.\n\n\"Attention!\" said Kennedy. \"Fire!\"\n\nThe double concussion resounded like a thunderbolt and died away into\ncries of rage and pain, and in a moment the whole horde had disappeared.\n\nBut, in the midst of these yells and howls, a strange, unexpected--nay\nwhat seemed an impossible--cry had been heard! A human voice had,\ndistinctly, called aloud in the French language--\n\n\"Help! help!\"\n\nKennedy and Joe, dumb with amazement, had regained the car immediately.\n\n\"Did you hear that?\" the doctor asked them.\n\n\"Undoubtedly, that supernatural cry, 'A moi! a moi!' comes from a\nFrenchman in the hands of these barbarians!\"\n\n\"A traveller.\"\n\n\"A missionary, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Poor wretch!\" said Kennedy, \"they're assassinating him--making a martyr\nof him!\"\n\nThe doctor then spoke, and it was impossible for him to conceal his\nemotions.\n\n\"There can be no doubt of it,\" he said; \"some unfortunate Frenchman has\nfallen into the hands of these savages. We must not leave this place\nwithout doing all in our power to save him. When he heard the sound\nof our guns, he recognized an unhoped-for assistance, a providential\ninterposition. We shall not disappoint his last hope. Are such your\nviews?\"\n\n\"They are, doctor, and we are ready to obey you.\"\n\n\"Let us, then, lay our heads together to devise some plan, and in the\nmorning we'll try to rescue him.\"\n\n\"But how shall we drive off those abominable blacks?\" asked Kennedy.\n\n\"It's quite clear to me, from the way in which they made off, that they\nare unacquainted with fire-arms. We must, therefore, profit by their\nfears; but we shall await daylight before acting, and then we can form\nour plans of rescue according to circumstances.\"\n\n\"The poor captive cannot be far off,\" said Joe, \"because--\"\n\n\"Help! help!\" repeated the voice, but much more feebly this time.\n\n\"The savage wretches!\" exclaimed Joe, trembling with indignation.\n\"Suppose they should kill him to-night!\"\n\n\"Do you hear, doctor,\" resumed Kennedy, seizing the doctor's hand.\n\"Suppose they should kill him to-night!\"\n\n\"It is not at all likely, my friends. These savage tribes kill their\ncaptives in broad daylight; they must have the sunshine.\"\n\n\"Now, if I were to take advantage of the darkness to slip down to the\npoor fellow?\" said Kennedy.\n\n\"And I'll go with you,\" said Joe, warmly.\n\n\"Pause, my friends--pause! The suggestion does honor to your hearts\nand to your courage; but you would expose us all to great peril, and do\nstill greater harm to the unfortunate man whom you wish to aid.\"\n\n\"Why so?\" asked Kennedy. \"These savages are frightened and dispersed:\nthey will not return.\"\n\n\"Dick, I implore you, heed what I say. I am acting for the common good;\nand if by any accident you should be taken by surprise, all would be\nlost.\"\n\n\"But, think of that poor wretch, hoping for aid, waiting there, praying,\ncalling aloud. Is no one to go to his assistance? He must think that his\nsenses deceived him; that he heard nothing!\"\n\n\"We can reassure him, on that score,\" said Dr. Ferguson--and, standing\nerect, making a speaking-trumpet of his hands, he shouted at the top of\nhis voice, in French: \"Whoever you are, be of good cheer! Three friends\nare watching over you.\"\n\nA terrific howl from the savages responded to these words--no doubt\ndrowning the prisoner's reply.\n\n\"They are murdering him! they are murdering him!\" exclaimed Kennedy.\n\"Our interference will have served no other purpose than to hasten the\nhour of his doom. We must act!\"\n\n\"But how, Dick? What do you expect to do in the midst of this darkness?\"\n\n\"Oh, if it was only daylight!\" sighed Joe.\n\n\"Well, and suppose it were daylight?\" said the doctor, in a singular\ntone.\n\n\"Nothing more simple, doctor,\" said Kennedy. \"I'd go down and scatter\nall these savage villains with powder and ball!\"\n\n\"And you, Joe, what would you do?\"\n\n\"I, master? why, I'd act more prudently, maybe, by telling the prisoner\nto make his escape in a certain direction that we'd agree upon.\"\n\n\"And how would you get him to know that?\"\n\n\"By means of this arrow that I caught flying the other day. I'd tie a\nnote to it, or I'd just call out to him in a loud voice what you want\nhim to do, because these black fellows don't understand the language\nthat you'd speak in!\"\n\n\"Your plans are impracticable, my dear friends. The greatest difficulty\nwould be for this poor fellow to escape at all--even admitting that he\nshould manage to elude the vigilance of his captors. As for you, my\ndear Dick, with determined daring, and profiting by their alarm at our\nfire-arms, your project might possibly succeed; but, were it to fail,\nyou would be lost, and we should have two persons to save instead\nof one. No! we must put ALL the chances on OUR side, and go to work\ndifferently.\"\n\n\"But let us act at once!\" said the hunter.\n\n\"Perhaps we may,\" said the doctor, throwing considerable stress upon the\nwords.\n\n\"Why, doctor, can you light up such darkness as this?\"\n\n\"Who knows, Joe?\"\n\n\"Ah! if you can do that, you're the greatest learned man in the world!\"\n\nThe doctor kept silent for a few moments; he was thinking. His two\ncompanions looked at him with much emotion, for they were greatly\nexcited by the strangeness of the situation. Ferguson at last resumed:\n\n\"Here is my plan: We have two hundred pounds of ballast left, since\nthe bags we brought with us are still untouched. I'll suppose that this\nprisoner, who is evidently exhausted by suffering, weighs as much as one\nof us; there will still remain sixty pounds of ballast to throw out, in\ncase we should want to ascend suddenly.\"\n\n\"How do you expect to manage the balloon?\" asked Kennedy.\n\n\"This is the idea, Dick: you will admit that if I can get to the\nprisoner, and throw out a quantity of ballast, equal to his weight, I\nshall have in nowise altered the equilibrium of the balloon. But, then,\nif I want to get a rapid ascension, so as to escape these savages,\nI must employ means more energetic than the cylinder. Well, then, in\nthrowing out this overplus of ballast at a given moment, I am certain to\nrise with great rapidity.\"\n\n\"That's plain enough.\"\n\n\"Yes; but there is one drawback: it consists in the fact that, in order\nto descend after that, I should have to part with a quantity of gas\nproportionate to the surplus ballast that I had thrown out. Now, the\ngas is precious; but we must not haggle over it when the life of a\nfellow-creature is at stake.\"\n\n\"You are right, sir; we must do every thing in our power to save him.\"\n\n\"Let us work, then, and get these bags all arranged on the rim of the\ncar, so that they may be thrown overboard at one movement.\"\n\n\"But this darkness?\"\n\n\"It hides our preparations, and will be dispersed only when they are\nfinished. Take care to have all our weapons close at hand. Perhaps we\nmay have to fire; so we have one shot in the rifle; four for the two\nmuskets; twelve in the two revolvers; or seventeen in all, which might\nbe fired in a quarter of a minute. But perhaps we shall not have to\nresort to all this noisy work. Are you ready?\"\n\n\"We're ready,\" responded Joe.\n\nThe sacks were placed as requested, and the arms were put in good order.\n\n\"Very good!\" said the doctor. \"Have an eye to every thing. Joe will see\nto throwing out the ballast, and Dick will carry off the prisoner; but\nlet nothing be done until I give the word. Joe will first detach the\nanchor, and then quickly make his way back to the car.\"\n\nJoe let himself slide down by the rope; and, in a few moments,\nreappeared at his post; while the balloon, thus liberated, hung almost\nmotionless in the air.\n\nIn the mean time the doctor assured himself of the presence of a\nsufficient quantity of gas in the mixing-tank to feed the cylinder, if\nnecessary, without there being any need of resorting for some time\nto the Buntzen battery. He then took out the two perfectly-isolated\nconducting-wires, which served for the decomposition of the water, and,\nsearching in his travelling-sack, brought forth two pieces of charcoal,\ncut down to a sharp point, and fixed one at the end of each wire.\n\nHis two friends looked on, without knowing what he was about, but they\nkept perfectly silent. When the doctor had finished, he stood up erect\nin the car, and, taking the two pieces of charcoal, one in each hand,\ndrew their points nearly together.\n\nIn a twinkling, an intense and dazzling light was produced, with an\ninsupportable glow between the two pointed ends of charcoal, and a huge\njet of electric radiance literally broke the darkness of the night.\n\n\"Oh!\" ejaculated the astonished friends.\n\n\"Not a word!\" cautioned the doctor.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SECOND.\n\nThe Jet of Light.--The Missionary.--The Rescue in a Ray of\nElectricity.--A Lazarist Priest.--But little Hope.--The Doctor's\nCare.--A Life of Self-Denial.--Passing a Volcano.\n\nDr. Ferguson darted his powerful electric jet toward various points of\nspace, and caused it to rest on a spot from which shouts of terror were\nheard. His companions fixed their gaze eagerly on the place.\n\nThe baobab, over which the balloon was hanging almost motionless, stood\nin the centre of a clearing, where, between fields of Indian-corn and\nsugar-cane, were seen some fifty low, conical huts, around which swarmed\na numerous tribe.\n\nA hundred feet below the balloon stood a large post, or stake, and at\nits foot lay a human being--a young man of thirty years or more, with\nlong black hair, half naked, wasted and wan, bleeding, covered with\nwounds, his head bowed over upon his breast, as Christ's was, when He\nhung upon the cross.\n\nThe hair, cut shorter on the top of his skull, still indicated the place\nof a half-effaced tonsure.\n\n\"A missionary! a priest!\" exclaimed Joe.\n\n\"Poor, unfortunate man!\" said Kennedy.\n\n\"We must save him, Dick!\" responded the doctor; \"we must save him!\"\n\nThe crowd of blacks, when they saw the balloon over their heads, like\na huge comet with a train of dazzling light, were seized with a terror\nthat may be readily imagined. Upon hearing their cries, the prisoner\nraised his head. His eyes gleamed with sudden hope, and, without too\nthoroughly comprehending what was taking place, he stretched out his\nhands to his unexpected deliverers.\n\n\"He is alive!\" exclaimed Ferguson. \"God be praised! The savages have got\na fine scare, and we shall save him! Are you ready, friends?\"\n\n\"Ready, doctor, at the word.\"\n\n\"Joe, shut off the cylinder!\"\n\nThe doctor's order was executed. An almost imperceptible breath of air\nimpelled the balloon directly over the prisoner, at the same time that\nit gently lowered with the contraction of the gas. For about ten minutes\nit remained floating in the midst of luminous waves, for Ferguson\ncontinued to flash right down upon the throng his glowing sheaf of rays,\nwhich, here and there, marked out swift and vivid sheets of light.\nThe tribe, under the influence of an indescribable terror, disappeared\nlittle by little in the huts, and there was complete solitude around\nthe stake. The doctor had, therefore, been right in counting upon the\nfantastic appearance of the balloon throwing out rays, as vivid as the\nsun's, through this intense gloom.\n\nThe car was approaching the ground; but a few of the savages, more\naudacious than the rest, guessing that their victim was about to escape\nfrom their clutches, came back with loud yells, and Kennedy seized his\nrifle. The doctor, however, besought him not to fire.\n\nThe priest, on his knees, for he had not the strength to stand erect,\nwas not even fastened to the stake, his weakness rendering that\nprecaution superfluous. At the instant when the car was close to the\nground, the brawny Scot, laying aside his rifle, and seizing the priest\naround the waist, lifted him into the car, while, at the same moment,\nJoe tossed over the two hundred pounds of ballast.\n\nThe doctor had expected to ascend rapidly, but, contrary to his\ncalculations, the balloon, after going up some three or four feet,\nremained there perfectly motionless.\n\n\"What holds us?\" he asked, with an accent of terror.\n\nSome of the savages were running toward them, uttering ferocious cries.\n\n\"Ah, ha!\" said Joe, \"one of those cursed blacks is hanging to the car!\"\n\n\"Dick! Dick!\" cried the doctor, \"the water-tank!\"\n\nKennedy caught his friend's idea on the instant, and, snatching up with\ndesperate strength one of the water-tanks weighing about one hundred\npounds, he tossed it overboard. The balloon, thus suddenly lightened,\nmade a leap of three hundred feet into the air, amid the howlings of the\ntribe whose prisoner thus escaped them in a blaze of dazzling light.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted the doctor's comrades.\n\nSuddenly, the balloon took a fresh leap, which carried it up to an\nelevation of a thousand feet.\n\n\"What's that?\" said Kennedy, who had nearly lost his balance.\n\n\"Oh! nothing; only that black villain leaving us!\" replied the doctor,\ntranquilly, and Joe, leaning over, saw the savage that had clung to the\ncar whirling over and over, with his arms outstretched in the air, and\npresently dashed to pieces on the ground. The doctor then separated his\nelectric wires, and every thing was again buried in profound obscurity.\nIt was now one o'clock in the morning.\n\nThe Frenchman, who had swooned away, at length opened his eyes.\n\n\"You are saved!\" were the doctor's first words.\n\n\"Saved!\" he with a sad smile replied in English, \"saved from a cruel\ndeath! My brethren, I thank you, but my days are numbered, nay, even my\nhours, and I have but little longer to live.\"\n\nWith this, the missionary, again yielding to exhaustion, relapsed into\nhis fainting-fit.\n\n\"He is dying!\" said Kennedy.\n\n\"No,\" replied the doctor, bending over him, \"but he is very weak; so let\nus lay him under the awning.\"\n\nAnd they did gently deposit on their blankets that poor, wasted body,\ncovered with scars and wounds, still bleeding where fire and steel had,\nin twenty places, left their agonizing marks. The doctor, taking an old\nhandkerchief, quickly prepared a little lint, which he spread over the\nwounds, after having washed them. These rapid attentions were bestowed\nwith the celerity and skill of a practised surgeon, and, when they were\ncomplete, the doctor, taking a cordial from his medicine-chest, poured a\nfew drops upon his patient's lips.\n\nThe latter feebly pressed his kind hands, and scarcely had the strength\nto say, \"Thank you! thank you!\"\n\nThe doctor comprehended that he must be left perfectly quiet; so he\nclosed the folds of the awning and resumed the guidance of the balloon.\n\nThe latter, after taking into account the weight of the new passenger,\nhad been lightened of one hundred and eighty pounds, and therefore\nkept aloft without the aid of the cylinder. At the first dawn of day,\na current drove it gently toward the west-northwest. The doctor went\nin under the awning for a moment or two, to look at his still sleeping\npatient.\n\n\"May Heaven spare the life of our new companion! Have you any hope?\"\nsaid the Scot.\n\n\"Yes, Dick, with care, in this pure, fresh atmosphere.\"\n\n\"How that man has suffered!\" said Joe, with feeling. \"He did bolder\nthings than we've done, in venturing all alone among those savage\ntribes!\"\n\n\"That cannot be questioned,\" assented the hunter.\n\nDuring the entire day the doctor would not allow the sleep of his\npatient to be disturbed. It was really a long stupor, broken only by\nan occasional murmur of pain that continued to disquiet and agitate the\ndoctor greatly.\n\nToward evening the balloon remained stationary in the midst of the\ngloom, and during the night, while Kennedy and Joe relieved each other\nin carefully tending the sick man, Ferguson kept watch over the safety\nof all.\n\nBy the morning of the next day, the balloon had moved, but very\nslightly, to the westward. The dawn came up pure and magnificent. The\nsick man was able to call his friends with a stronger voice. They raised\nthe curtains of the awning, and he inhaled with delight the keen morning\nair.\n\n\"How do you feel to-day?\" asked the doctor.\n\n\"Better, perhaps,\" he replied. \"But you, my friends, I have not seen\nyou yet, excepting in a dream! I can, indeed, scarcely recall what has\noccurred. Who are you--that your names may not be forgotten in my dying\nprayers?\"\n\n\"We are English travellers,\" replied Ferguson. \"We are trying to cross\nAfrica in a balloon, and, on our way, we have had the good fortune to\nrescue you.\"\n\n\"Science has its heroes,\" said the missionary.\n\n\"But religion its martyrs!\" rejoined the Scot.\n\n\"Are you a missionary?\" asked the doctor.\n\n\"I am a priest of the Lazarist mission. Heaven sent you to me--Heaven\nbe praised! The sacrifice of my life had been accomplished! But you come\nfrom Europe; tell me about Europe, about France! I have been without\nnews for the last five years!\"\n\n\"Five years! alone! and among these savages!\" exclaimed Kennedy with\namazement.\n\n\"They are souls to redeem! ignorant and barbarous brethren, whom\nreligion alone can instruct and civilize.\"\n\nDr. Ferguson, yielding to the priest's request, talked to him long and\nfully about France. He listened eagerly, and his eyes filled with tears.\nHe seized Kennedy's and Joe's hands by turns in his own, which were\nburning with fever. The doctor prepared him some tea, and he drank it\nwith satisfaction. After that, he had strength enough to raise himself\nup a little, and smiled with pleasure at seeing himself borne along\nthrough so pure a sky.\n\n\"You are daring travellers!\" he said, \"and you will succeed in your bold\nenterprise. You will again behold your relatives, your friends, your\ncountry--you--\"\n\nAt this moment, the weakness of the young missionary became so extreme\nthat they had to lay him again on the bed, where a prostration, lasting\nfor several hours, held him like a dead man under the eye of Dr.\nFerguson. The latter could not suppress his emotion, for he felt that\nthis life now in his charge was ebbing away. Were they then so soon\nto lose him whom they had snatched from an agonizing death? The doctor\nagain washed and dressed the young martyr's frightful wounds, and had to\nsacrifice nearly his whole stock of water to refresh his burning limbs.\nHe surrounded him with the tenderest and most intelligent care, until,\nat length, the sick man revived, little by little, in his arms, and\nrecovered his consciousness if not his strength.\n\nThe doctor was able to gather something of his history from his broken\nmurmurs.\n\n\"Speak in your native language,\" he said to the sufferer; \"I understand\nit, and it will fatigue you less.\"\n\nThe missionary was a poor young man from the village of Aradon, in\nBrittany, in the Morbihan country. His earliest instincts had drawn him\ntoward an ecclesiastical career, but to this life of self-sacrifice he\nwas also desirous of joining a life of danger, by entering the mission\nof the order of priesthood of which St. Vincent de Paul was the founder,\nand, at twenty, he quitted his country for the inhospitable shores of\nAfrica. From the sea-coast, overcoming obstacles, little by little,\nbraving all privations, pushing onward, afoot, and praying, he had\nadvanced to the very centre of those tribes that dwell among the\ntributary streams of the Upper Nile. For two years his faith was\nspurned, his zeal denied recognition, his charities taken in ill\npart, and he remained a prisoner to one of the cruelest tribes of the\nNyambarra, the object of every species of maltreatment. But still\nhe went on teaching, instructing, and praying. The tribe having been\ndispersed and he left for dead, in one of those combats which are\nso frequent between the tribes, instead of retracing his steps, he\npersisted in his evangelical mission. His most tranquil time was when he\nwas taken for a madman. Meanwhile, he had made himself familiar with the\nidioms of the country, and he catechised in them. At length, during two\nmore long years, he traversed these barbarous regions, impelled by\nthat superhuman energy that comes from God. For a year past he had been\nresiding with that tribe of the Nyam-Nyams known as the Barafri, one of\nthe wildest and most ferocious of them all. The chief having died a few\ndays before our travellers appeared, his sudden death was attributed to\nthe missionary, and the tribe resolved to immolate him. His sufferings\nhad already continued for the space of forty hours, and, as the doctor\nhad supposed, he was to have perished in the blaze of the noonday sun.\nWhen he heard the sound of fire-arms, nature got the best of him, and\nhe had cried out, \"Help! help!\" He then thought that he must have been\ndreaming, when a voice, that seemed to come from the sky, had uttered\nwords of consolation.\n\n\"I have no regrets,\" he said, \"for the life that is passing away from\nme; my life belongs to God!\"\n\n\"Hope still!\" said the doctor; \"we are near you, and we will save you\nnow, as we saved you from the tortures of the stake.\"\n\n\"I do not ask so much of Heaven,\" said the priest, with resignation.\n\"Blessed be God for having vouchsafed to me the joy before I die of\nhaving pressed your friendly hands, and having heard, once more, the\nlanguage of my country!\"\n\nThe missionary here grew weak again, and the whole day went by between\nhope and fear, Kennedy deeply moved, and Joe drawing his hand over his\neyes more than once when he thought that no one saw him.\n\nThe balloon made little progress, and the wind seemed as though\nunwilling to jostle its precious burden.\n\nToward evening, Joe discovered a great light in the west. Under more\nelevated latitudes, it might have been mistaken for an immense aurora\nborealis, for the sky appeared on fire. The doctor very attentively\nexamined the phenomenon.\n\n\"It is, perhaps, only a volcano in full activity,\" said he.\n\n\"But the wind is carrying us directly over it,\" replied Kennedy.\n\n\"Very well, we shall cross it then at a safe height!\" said the doctor.\n\nThree hours later, the Victoria was right among the mountains. Her exact\nposition was twenty-four degrees fifteen minutes east longitude,\nand four degrees forty-two minutes north latitude, and four degrees\nforty-two minutes north latitude. In front of her a volcanic crater was\npouring forth torrents of melted lava, and hurling masses of rock to an\nenormous height. There were jets, too, of liquid fire that fell back in\ndazzling cascades--a superb but dangerous spectacle, for the wind with\nunswerving certainty was carrying the balloon directly toward this\nblazing atmosphere.\n\nThis obstacle, which could not be turned, had to be crossed, so the\ncylinder was put to its utmost power, and the balloon rose to the height\nof six thousand feet, leaving between it and the volcano a space of more\nthan three hundred fathoms.\n\nFrom his bed of suffering, the dying missionary could contemplate that\nfiery crater from which a thousand jets of dazzling flame were that\nmoment escaping.\n\n\"How grand it is!\" said he, \"and how infinite is the power of God even\nin its most terrible manifestations!\"\n\nThis overflow of blazing lava wrapped the sides of the mountain with a\nveritable drapery of flame; the lower half of the balloon glowed redly\nin the upper night; a torrid heat ascended to the car, and Dr. Ferguson\nmade all possible haste to escape from this perilous situation.\n\nBy ten o'clock the volcano could be seen only as a red point on the\nhorizon, and the balloon tranquilly pursued her course in a less\nelevated zone of the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-THIRD.\n\nJoe in a Fit of Rage.--The Death of a Good Man.--The Night of watching\nby the Body.--Barrenness and Drought.--The Burial.--The Quartz\nRocks.--Joe's Hallucinations.--A Precious Ballast.--A Survey of the\nGold-bearing Mountains.--The Beginning of Joe's Despair.\n\nA magnificent night overspread the earth, and the missionary lay quietly\nasleep in utter exhaustion.\n\n\"He'll not get over it!\" sighed Joe. \"Poor young fellow--scarcely thirty\nyears of age!\"\n\n\"He'll die in our arms. His breathing, which was so feeble before,\nis growing weaker still, and I can do nothing to save him,\" said the\ndoctor, despairingly.\n\n\"The infamous scoundrels!\" exclaimed Joe, grinding his teeth, in one of\nthose fits of rage that came over him at long intervals; \"and to think\nthat, in spite of all, this good man could find words only to pity them,\nto excuse, to pardon them!\"\n\n\"Heaven has given him a lovely night, Joe--his last on earth, perhaps!\nHe will suffer but little more after this, and his dying will be only a\npeaceful falling asleep.\"\n\nThe dying man uttered some broken words, and the doctor at once went to\nhim. His breathing became difficult, and he asked for air. The curtains\nwere drawn entirely back, and he inhaled with rapture the light breezes\nof that clear, beautiful night. The stars sent him their trembling rays,\nand the moon wrapped him in the white winding-sheet of its effulgence.\n\n\"My friends,\" said he, in an enfeebled voice, \"I am going. May God\nrequite you, and bring you to your safe harbor! May he pay for me the\ndebt of gratitude that I owe to you!\"\n\n\"You must still hope,\" replied Kennedy. \"This is but a passing fit of\nweakness. You will not die. How could any one die on this beautiful\nsummer night?\"\n\n\"Death is at hand,\" replied the missionary, \"I know it! Let me look it\nin the face! Death, the commencement of things eternal, is but the end\nof earthly cares. Place me upon my knees, my brethren, I beseech you!\"\n\nKennedy lifted him up, and it was distressing to see his weakened limbs\nbend under him.\n\n\"My God! my God!\" exclaimed the dying apostle, \"have pity on me!\"\n\nHis countenance shone. Far above that earth on which he had known no\njoys; in the midst of that night which sent to him its softest radiance;\non the way to that heaven toward which he uplifted his spirit, as though\nin a miraculous assumption, he seemed already to live and breathe in the\nnew existence.\n\nHis last gesture was a supreme blessing on his new friends of only one\nday. Then he fell back into the arms of Kennedy, whose countenance was\nbathed in hot tears.\n\n\"Dead!\" said the doctor, bending over him, \"dead!\" And with one common\naccord, the three friends knelt together in silent prayer.\n\n\"To-morrow,\" resumed the doctor, \"we shall bury him in the African soil\nwhich he has besprinkled with his blood.\"\n\nDuring the rest of the night the body was watched, turn by turn, by the\nthree travellers, and not a word disturbed the solemn silence. Each of\nthem was weeping.\n\nThe next day the wind came from the south, and the balloon moved slowly\nover a vast plateau of mountains: there, were extinct craters; here,\nbarren ravines; not a drop of water on those parched crests; piles\nof broken rocks; huge stony masses scattered hither and thither,\nand, interspersed with whitish marl, all indicated the most complete\nsterility.\n\nToward noon, the doctor, for the purpose of burying the body, decided to\ndescend into a ravine, in the midst of some plutonic rocks of primitive\nformation. The surrounding mountains would shelter him, and enable him\nto bring his car to the ground, for there was no tree in sight to which\nhe could make it fast.\n\nBut, as he had explained to Kennedy, it was now impossible for him to\ndescend, except by releasing a quantity of gas proportionate to his loss\nof ballast at the time when he had rescued the missionary. He therefore\nopened the valve of the outside balloon. The hydrogen escaped, and the\nVictoria quietly descended into the ravine.\n\nAs soon as the car touched the ground, the doctor shut the valve. Joe\nleaped out, holding on the while to the rim of the car with one hand,\nand with the other gathering up a quantity of stones equal to his own\nweight. He could then use both hands, and had soon heaped into the car\nmore than five hundred pounds of stones, which enabled both the doctor\nand Kennedy, in their turn, to get out. Thus the Victoria found herself\nbalanced, and her ascensional force insufficient to raise her.\n\nMoreover, it was not necessary to gather many of these stones, for\nthe blocks were extremely heavy, so much so, indeed, that the doctor's\nattention was attracted by the circumstance. The soil, in fact, was\nbestrewn with quartz and porphyritic rocks.\n\n\"This is a singular discovery!\" said the doctor, mentally.\n\nIn the mean while, Kennedy and Joe had strolled away a few paces,\nlooking up a proper spot for the grave. The heat was extreme in this\nravine, shut in as it was like a sort of furnace. The noonday sun poured\ndown its rays perpendicularly into it.\n\nThe first thing to be done was to clear the surface of the fragments of\nrock that encumbered it, and then a quite deep grave had to be dug, so\nthat the wild animals should not be able to disinter the corpse.\n\nThe body of the martyred missionary was then solemnly placed in it. The\nearth was thrown in over his remains, and above it masses of rock were\ndeposited, in rude resemblance to a tomb.\n\nThe doctor, however, remained motionless, and lost in his reflections.\nHe did not even heed the call of his companions, nor did he return with\nthem to seek a shelter from the heat of the day.\n\n\"What are you thinking about, doctor?\" asked Kennedy.\n\n\"About a singular freak of Nature, a curious effect of chance. Do you\nknow, now, in what kind of soil that man of self-denial, that poor one\nin spirit, has just been buried?\"\n\n\"No! what do you mean, doctor?\"\n\n\"That priest, who took the oath of perpetual poverty, now reposes in a\ngold-mine!\"\n\n\"A gold-mine!\" exclaimed Kennedy and Joe in one breath.\n\n\"Yes, a gold-mine,\" said the doctor, quietly. \"Those blocks which you\nare trampling under foot, like worthless stones, contain gold-ore of\ngreat purity.\"\n\n\"Impossible! impossible!\" repeated Joe.\n\n\"You would not have to look long among those fissures of slaty schist\nwithout finding peptites of considerable value.\"\n\nJoe at once rushed like a crazy man among the scattered fragments, and\nKennedy was not long in following his example.\n\n\"Keep cool, Joe,\" said his master.\n\n\"Why, doctor, you speak of the thing quite at your ease.\"\n\n\"What! a philosopher of your mettle--\"\n\n\"Ah, master, no philosophy holds good in this case!\"\n\n\"Come! come! Let us reflect a little. What good would all this wealth do\nyou? We cannot carry any of it away with us.\"\n\n\"We can't take any of it with us, indeed?\"\n\n\"It's rather too heavy for our car! I even hesitated to tell you any\nthing about it, for fear of exciting your regret!\"\n\n\"What!\" said Joe, again, \"abandon these treasures--a fortune for\nus!--really for us--our own--leave it behind!\"\n\n\"Take care, my friend! Would you yield to the thirst for gold? Has not\nthis dead man whom you have just helped to bury, taught you the vanity\nof human affairs?\"\n\n\"All that is true,\" replied Joe, \"but gold! Mr. Kennedy, won't you help\nto gather up a trifle of all these millions?\"\n\n\"What could we do with them, Joe?\" said the hunter, unable to repress a\nsmile. \"We did not come hither in search of fortune, and we cannot take\none home with us.\"\n\n\"The millions are rather heavy, you know,\" resumed the doctor, \"and\ncannot very easily be put into one's pocket.\"\n\n\"But, at least,\" said Joe, driven to his last defences, \"couldn't we\ntake some of that ore for ballast, instead of sand?\"\n\n\"Very good! I consent,\" said the doctor, \"but you must not make too\nmany wry faces when we come to throw some thousands of crowns' worth\noverboard.\"\n\n\"Thousands of crowns!\" echoed Joe; \"is it possible that there is so much\ngold in them, and that all this is the same?\"\n\n\"Yes, my friend, this is a reservoir in which Nature has been heaping up\nher wealth for centuries! There is enough here to enrich whole nations!\nAn Australia and a California both together in the midst of the\nwilderness!\"\n\n\"And the whole of it is to remain useless!\"\n\n\"Perhaps! but at all events, here's what I'll do to console you.\"\n\n\"That would be rather difficult to do!\" said Joe, with a contrite air.\n\n\"Listen! I will take the exact bearings of this spot, and give them to\nyou, so that, upon your return to England, you can tell our countrymen\nabout it, and let them have a share, if you think that so much gold\nwould make them happy.\"\n\n\"Ah! master, I give up; I see that you are right, and that there is\nnothing else to be done. Let us fill our car with the precious mineral,\nand what remains at the end of the trip will be so much made.\"\n\nAnd Joe went to work. He did so, too, with all his might, and soon had\ncollected more than a thousand pieces of quartz, which contained gold\nenclosed as though in an extremely hard crystal casket.\n\nThe doctor watched him with a smile; and, while Joe went on, he took\nthe bearings, and found that the missionary's grave lay in twenty-two\ndegrees twenty-three minutes east longitude, and four degrees fifty-five\nminutes north latitude.\n\nThen, casting one glance at the swelling of the soil, beneath which the\nbody of the poor Frenchman reposed, he went back to his car.\n\nHe would have erected a plain, rude cross over the tomb, left solitary\nthus in the midst of the African deserts, but not a tree was to be seen\nin the environs.\n\n\"God will recognize it!\" said Kennedy.\n\nAn anxiety of another sort now began to steal over the doctor's mind. He\nwould have given much of the gold before him for a little water--for he\nhad to replace what had been thrown overboard when the negro was carried\nup into the air. But it was impossible to find it in these arid regions;\nand this reflection gave him great uneasiness. He had to feed his\ncylinder continually; and he even began to find that he had not enough\nto quench the thirst of his party. Therefore he determined to lose no\nopportunity of replenishing his supply.\n\nUpon getting back to the car, he found it burdened with the\nquartz-blocks that Joe's greed had heaped in it. He got in, however,\nwithout saying any thing. Kennedy took his customary place, and Joe\nfollowed, but not without casting a covetous glance at the treasures in\nthe ravine.\n\nThe doctor rekindled the light in the cylinder; the spiral became\nheated; the current of hydrogen came in a few minutes, and the gas\ndilated; but the balloon did not stir an inch.\n\nJoe looked on uneasily, but kept silent.\n\n\"Joe!\" said the doctor.\n\nJoe made no reply.\n\n\"Joe! Don't you hear me?\"\n\nJoe made a sign that he heard; but he would not understand.\n\n\"Do me the kindness to throw out some of that quartz!\"\n\n\"But, doctor, you gave me leave--\"\n\n\"I gave you leave to replace the ballast; that was all!\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Do you want to stay forever in this desert?\"\n\nJoe cast a despairing look at Kennedy; but the hunter put on the air of\na man who could do nothing in the matter.\n\n\"Well, Joe?\"\n\n\"Then your cylinder don't work,\" said the obstinate fellow.\n\n\"My cylinder? It is lit, as you perceive. But the balloon will not rise\nuntil you have thrown off a little ballast.\"\n\nJoe scratched his ear, picked up a piece of quartz, the smallest in the\nlot, weighed and reweighed it, and tossed it up and down in his hand. It\nwas a fragment of about three or four pounds. At last he threw it out.\n\nBut the balloon did not budge.\n\n\"Humph!\" said he; \"we're not going up yet.\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" said the doctor. \"Keep on throwing.\"\n\nKennedy laughed. Joe now threw out some ten pounds, but the balloon\nstood still.\n\nJoe got very pale.\n\n\"Poor fellow!\" said the doctor. \"Mr. Kennedy, you and I weigh, unless I\nam mistaken, about four hundred pounds--so that you'll have to get rid\nof at least that weight, since it was put in here to make up for us.\"\n\n\"Throw away four hundred pounds!\" said Joe, piteously.\n\n\"And some more with it, or we can't rise. Come, courage, Joe!\"\n\nThe brave fellow, heaving deep sighs, began at last to lighten the\nballoon; but, from time to time, he would stop, and ask:\n\n\"Are you going up?\"\n\n\"No, not yet,\" was the invariable response.\n\n\"It moves!\" said he, at last.\n\n\"Keep on!\" replied the doctor.\n\n\"It's going up; I'm sure.\"\n\n\"Keep on yet,\" said Kennedy.\n\nAnd Joe, picking up one more block, desperately tossed it out of the\ncar. The balloon rose a hundred feet or so, and, aided by the cylinder,\nsoon passed above the surrounding summits.\n\n\"Now, Joe,\" resumed the doctor, \"there still remains a handsome fortune\nfor you; and, if we can only keep the rest of this with us until the end\nof our trip, there you are--rich for the balance of your days!\"\n\nJoe made no answer, but stretched himself out luxuriously on his heap of\nquartz.\n\n\"See, my dear Dick!\" the doctor went on. \"Just see the power of this\nmetal over the cleverest lad in the world! What passions, what greed,\nwhat crimes, the knowledge of such a mine as that would cause! It is sad\nto think of it!\"\n\nBy evening the balloon had made ninety miles to the westward, and was,\nin a direct line, fourteen hundred miles from Zanzibar.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FOURTH.\n\nThe Wind dies away.--The Vicinity of the Desert.--The Mistake in\nthe Water-Supply.--The Nights of the Equator.--Dr. Ferguson's\nAnxieties.--The Situation flatly stated.--Energetic Replies of Kennedy\nand Joe.--One Night more.\n\nThe balloon, having been made fast to a solitary tree, almost completely\ndried up by the aridity of the region in which it stood, passed the\nnight in perfect quietness; and the travellers were enabled to enjoy a\nlittle of the repose which they so greatly needed. The emotions of the\nday had left sad impressions on their minds.\n\nToward morning, the sky had resumed its brilliant purity and its heat.\nThe balloon ascended, and, after several ineffectual attempts, fell into\na current that, although not rapid, bore them toward the northwest.\n\n\"We are not making progress,\" said the doctor. \"If I am not mistaken,\nwe have accomplished nearly half of our journey in ten days; but, at the\nrate at which we are going, it would take months to end it; and that is\nall the more vexatious, that we are threatened with a lack of water.\"\n\n\"But we'll find some,\" said Joe. \"It is not to be thought of that we\nshouldn't discover some river, some stream, or pond, in all this vast\nextent of country.\"\n\n\"I hope so.\"\n\n\"Now don't you think that it's Joe's cargo of stone that is keeping us\nback?\"\n\nKennedy asked this question only to tease Joe; and he did so the\nmore willingly because he had, for a moment, shared the poor lad's\nhallucinations; but, not finding any thing in them, he had fallen back\ninto the attitude of a strong-minded looker-on, and turned the affair\noff with a laugh.\n\nJoe cast a mournful glance at him; but the doctor made no reply. He was\nthinking, not without secret terror, probably, of the vast solitudes\nof Sahara--for there whole weeks sometimes pass without the caravans\nmeeting with a single spring of water. Occupied with these thoughts, he\nscrutinized every depression of the soil with the closest attention.\n\nThese anxieties, and the incidents recently occurring, had not been\nwithout their effect upon the spirits of our three travellers. They\nconversed less, and were more wrapt in their own thoughts.\n\nJoe, clever lad as he was, seemed no longer the same person since his\ngaze had plunged into that ocean of gold. He kept entirely silent,\nand gazed incessantly upon the stony fragments heaped up in the\ncar--worthless to-day, but of inestimable value to-morrow.\n\nThe appearance of this part of Africa was, moreover, quite calculated\nto inspire alarm: the desert was gradually expanding around them; not\nanother village was to be seen--not even a collection of a few huts; and\nvegetation also was disappearing. Barely a few dwarf plants could now be\nnoticed, like those on the wild heaths of Scotland; then came the first\ntract of grayish sand and flint, with here and there a lentisk tree and\nbrambles. In the midst of this sterility, the rudimental carcass of the\nGlobe appeared in ridges of sharply-jutting rock. These symptoms of a\ntotally dry and barren region greatly disquieted Dr. Ferguson.\n\nIt seemed as though no caravan had ever braved this desert expanse, or\nit would have left visible traces of its encampments, or the whitened\nbones of men and animals. But nothing of the kind was to be seen, and\nthe aeronauts felt that, ere long, an immensity of sand would cover the\nwhole of this desolate region.\n\nHowever, there was no going back; they must go forward; and, indeed, the\ndoctor asked for nothing better; he would even have welcomed a tempest\nto carry him beyond this country. But, there was not a cloud in the sky.\nAt the close of the day, the balloon had not made thirty miles.\n\nIf there had been no lack of water! But, there remained only three\ngallons in all! The doctor put aside one gallon, destined to quench the\nburning thirst that a heat of ninety degrees rendered intolerable. Two\ngallons only then remained to supply the cylinder. Hence, they could\nproduce no more than four hundred and eighty cubic feet of gas; yet the\ncylinder consumed about nine cubic feet per hour. Consequently, they\ncould not keep on longer than fifty-four hours--and all this was a\nmathematical calculation!\n\n\"Fifty-four hours!\" said the doctor to his companions. \"Therefore, as I\nam determined not to travel by night, for fear of passing some stream\nor pool, we have but three days and a half of journeying during which we\nmust find water, at all hazards. I have thought it my duty to make you\naware of the real state of the case, as I have retained only one\ngallon for drinking, and we shall have to put ourselves on the shortest\nallowance.\"\n\n\"Put us on short allowance, then, doctor,\" responded Kennedy, \"but we\nmust not despair. We have three days left, you say?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear Dick!\"\n\n\"Well, as grieving over the matter won't help us, in three days there\nwill be time enough to decide upon what is to be done; in the meanwhile,\nlet us redouble our vigilance!\"\n\nAt their evening meal, the water was strictly measured out, and the\nbrandy was increased in quantity in the punch they drank. But they had\nto be careful with the spirits, the latter being more likely to produce\nthan to quench thirst.\n\nThe car rested, during the night, upon an immense plateau, in which\nthere was a deep hollow; its height was scarcely eight hundred feet\nabove the level of the sea. This circumstance gave the doctor some hope,\nsince it recalled to his mind the conjectures of geographers concerning\nthe existence of a vast stretch of water in the centre of Africa. But,\nif such a lake really existed, the point was to reach it, and not a sign\nof change was visible in the motionless sky.\n\nTo the tranquil night and its starry magnificence succeeded the\nunchanging daylight and the blazing rays of the sun; and, from the\nearliest dawn, the temperature became scorching. At five o'clock in\nthe morning, the doctor gave the signal for departure, and, for\na considerable time, the balloon remained immovable in the leaden\natmosphere.\n\nThe doctor might have escaped this intense heat by rising into a higher\nrange, but, in order to do so, he would have had to consume a large\nquantity of water, a thing that had now become impossible. He contented\nhimself, therefore, with keeping the balloon at one hundred feet from\nthe ground, and, at that elevation, a feeble current drove it toward the\nwestern horizon.\n\nThe breakfast consisted of a little dried meat and pemmican. By noon,\nthe Victoria had advanced only a few miles.\n\n\"We cannot go any faster,\" said the doctor; \"we no longer command--we\nhave to obey.\"\n\n\"Ah! doctor, here is one of those occasions when a propeller would not\nbe a thing to be despised.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly so, Dick, provided it would not require an expenditure of\nwater to put it in motion, for, in that case, the situation would be\nprecisely the same; moreover, up to this time, nothing practical of the\nsort has been invented. Balloons are still at that point where ships\nwere before the invention of steam. It took six thousand years to invent\npropellers and screws; so we have time enough yet.\"\n\n\"Confounded heat!\" said Joe, wiping away the perspiration that was\nstreaming from his forehead.\n\n\"If we had water, this heat would be of service to us, for it dilates\nthe hydrogen in the balloon, and diminishes the amount required in the\nspiral, although it is true that, if we were not short of the useful\nliquid, we should not have to economize it. Ah! that rascally savage who\ncost us the tank!\"*\n\n     * The water-tank had been thrown overboard when the native\n     clung to the car.\n\n\"You don't regret, though, what you did, doctor?\"\n\n\"No, Dick, since it was in our power to save that unfortunate missionary\nfrom a horrible death. But, the hundred pounds of water that we threw\noverboard would be very useful to us now; it would be thirteen or\nfourteen days more of progress secured, or quite enough to carry us over\nthis desert.\"\n\n\"We've made at least half the journey, haven't we?\" asked Joe.\n\n\"In distance, yes; but in duration, no, should the wind leave us; and\nit, even now, has a tendency to die away altogether.\"\n\n\"Come, sir,\" said Joe, again, \"we must not complain; we've got\nalong pretty well, thus far, and whatever happens to me, I can't get\ndesperate. We'll find water; mind, I tell you so.\"\n\nThe soil, however, ran lower from mile to mile; the undulations of the\ngold-bearing mountains they had left died away into the plain, like the\nlast throes of exhausted Nature. Scanty grass took the place of the\nfine trees of the east; only a few belts of half-scorched herbage still\ncontended against the invasion of the sand, and the huge rocks, that\nhad rolled down from the distant summits, crushed in their fall, had\nscattered in sharp-edged pebbles which soon again became coarse sand,\nand finally impalpable dust.\n\n\"Here, at last, is Africa, such as you pictured it to yourself, Joe! Was\nI not right in saying, 'Wait a little?' eh?\"\n\n\"Well, master, it's all natural, at least--heat and dust. It would be\nfoolish to look for any thing else in such a country. Do you see,\" he\nadded, laughing, \"I had no confidence, for my part, in your forests and\nyour prairies; they were out of reason. What was the use of coming so\nfar to find scenery just like England? Here's the first time that I\nbelieve in Africa, and I'm not sorry to get a taste of it.\"\n\nToward evening, the doctor calculated that the balloon had not made\ntwenty miles during that whole burning day, and a heated gloom closed\nin upon it, as soon as the sun had disappeared behind the horizon, which\nwas traced against the sky with all the precision of a straight line.\n\nThe next day was Thursday, the 1st of May, but the days followed each\nother with desperate monotony. Each morning was like the one that had\npreceded it; noon poured down the same exhaustless rays, and night\ncondensed in its shadow the scattered heat which the ensuing day\nwould again bequeath to the succeeding night. The wind, now scarcely\nobservable, was rather a gasp than a breath, and the morning could\nalmost be foreseen when even that gasp would cease.\n\nThe doctor reacted against the gloominess of the situation and retained\nall the coolness and self-possession of a disciplined heart. With his\nglass he scrutinized every quarter of the horizon; he saw the last\nrising ground gradually melting to the dead level, and the last\nvegetation disappearing, while, before him, stretched the immensity of\nthe desert.\n\nThe responsibility resting upon him pressed sorely, but he did not allow\nhis disquiet to appear. Those two men, Dick and Joe, friends of his,\nboth of them, he had induced to come with him almost by the force alone\nof friendship and of duty. Had he done well in that? Was it not like\nattempting to tread forbidden paths? Was he not, in this trip, trying\nto pass the borders of the impossible? Had not the Almighty reserved for\nlater ages the knowledge of this inhospitable continent?\n\nAll these thoughts, of the kind that arise in hours of discouragement,\nsucceeded each other and multiplied in his mind, and, by an irresistible\nassociation of ideas, the doctor allowed himself to be carried beyond\nthe bounds of logic and of reason. After having established in his own\nmind what he should NOT have done, the next question was, what he should\ndo, then. Would it be impossible to retrace his steps? Were there\nnot currents higher up that would waft him to less arid regions? Well\ninformed with regard to the countries over which he had passed, he was\nutterly ignorant of those to come, and thus his conscience speaking\naloud to him, he resolved, in his turn, to speak frankly to his two\ncompanions. He thereupon laid the whole state of the case plainly before\nthem; he showed them what had been done, and what there was yet to do;\nat the worst, they could return, or attempt it, at least.--What did they\nthink about it?\n\n\"I have no other opinion than that of my excellent master,\" said Joe;\n\"what he may have to suffer, I can suffer, and that better than he can,\nperhaps. Where he goes, there I'll go!\"\n\n\"And you, Kennedy?\"\n\n\"I, doctor, I'm not the man to despair; no one was less ignorant than\nI of the perils of the enterprise, but I did not want to see them,\nfrom the moment that you determined to brave them. Under present\ncircumstances, my opinion is, that we should persevere--go clear to\nthe end. Besides, to return looks to me quite as perilous as the other\ncourse. So onward, then! you may count upon us!\"\n\n\"Thanks, my gallant friends!\" replied the doctor, with much real\nfeeling, \"I expected such devotion as this; but I needed these\nencouraging words. Yet, once again, thank you, from the bottom of my\nheart!\"\n\nAnd, with this, the three friends warmly grasped each other by the hand.\n\n\"Now, hear me!\" said the doctor. \"According to my solar observations,\nwe are not more than three hundred miles from the Gulf of Guinea;\nthe desert, therefore, cannot extend indefinitely, since the coast is\ninhabited, and the country has been explored for some distance back into\nthe interior. If needs be, we can direct our course to that quarter, and\nit seems out of the question that we should not come across some oasis,\nor some well, where we could replenish our stock of water. But, what we\nwant now, is the wind, for without it we are held here suspended in the\nair at a dead calm.\n\n\"Let us wait with resignation,\" said the hunter.\n\nBut, each of the party, in his turn, vainly scanned the space around him\nduring that long wearisome day. Nothing could be seen to form the basis\nof a hope. The very last inequalities of the soil disappeared with the\nsetting sun, whose horizontal rays stretched in long lines of fire over\nthe flat immensity. It was the Desert!\n\nOur aeronauts had scarcely gone a distance of fifteen miles, having\nexpended, as on the preceding day, one hundred and thirty-five cubic\nfeet of gas to feed the cylinder, and two pints of water out of the\nremaining eight had been sacrificed to the demands of intense thirst.\n\nThe night passed quietly--too quietly, indeed, but the doctor did not\nsleep!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FIFTH.\n\nA Little Philosophy.--A Cloud on the Horizon.--In the Midst of a\nFog.--The Strange Balloon.--An Exact View of the Victoria.--The\nPalm-Trees.--Traces of a Caravan.--The Well in the Midst of the Desert.\n\nOn the morrow, there was the same purity of sky, the same stillness of\nthe atmosphere. The balloon rose to an elevation of five hundred\nfeet, but it had scarcely changed its position to the westward in any\nperceptible degree.\n\n\"We are right in the open desert,\" said the doctor. \"Look at that vast\nreach of sand! What a strange spectacle! What a singular arrangement of\nnature! Why should there be, in one place, such extreme luxuriance of\nvegetation yonder, and here, this extreme aridity, and that in the same\nlatitude, and under the same rays of the sun?\"\n\n\"The why concerns me but little,\" answered Kennedy, \"the reason\ninterests me less than the fact. The thing is so; that's the important\npart of it!\"\n\n\"Oh, it is well to philosophize a little, Dick; it does no harm.\"\n\n\"Let us philosophize, then, if you will; we have time enough before us;\nwe are hardly moving; the wind is afraid to blow; it sleeps.\"\n\n\"That will not last forever,\" put in Joe; \"I think I see some banks of\nclouds in the east.\"\n\n\"Joe's right!\" said the doctor, after he had taken a look.\n\n\"Good!\" said Kennedy; \"now for our clouds, with a fine rain, and a fresh\nwind to dash it into our faces!\"\n\n\"Well, we'll see, Dick, we'll see!\"\n\n\"But this is Friday, master, and I'm afraid of Fridays!\"\n\n\"Well, I hope that this very day you'll get over those notions.\"\n\n\"I hope so, master, too. Whew!\" he added, mopping his face, \"heat's a\ngood thing, especially in winter, but in summer it don't do to take too\nmuch of it.\"\n\n\"Don't you fear the effect of the sun's heat on our balloon?\" asked\nKennedy, addressing the doctor.\n\n\"No! the gutta-percha coating resists much higher temperatures than\neven this. With my spiral I have subjected it inside to as much as one\nhundred and fifty-eight degrees sometimes, and the covering does not\nappear to have suffered.\"\n\n\"A cloud! a real cloud!\" shouted Joe at this moment, for that piercing\neyesight of his beat all the glasses.\n\nAnd, in fact, a thick bank of vapor, now quite distinct, could be seen\nslowly emerging above the horizon. It appeared to be very deep, and,\nas it were, puffed out. It was, in reality, a conglomeration of smaller\nclouds. The latter invariably retained their original formation, and\nfrom this circumstance the doctor concluded that there was no current of\nair in their collected mass.\n\nThis compact body of vapor had appeared about eight o'clock in the\nmorning, and, by eleven, it had already reached the height of the sun's\ndisk. The latter then disappeared entirely behind the murky veil, and\nthe lower belt of cloud, at the same moment, lifted above the line of\nthe horizon, which was again disclosed in a full blaze of daylight.\n\n\"It's only an isolated cloud,\" remarked the doctor. \"It won't do to\ncount much upon that.\"\n\n\"Look, Dick, its shape is just the same as when we saw it this morning!\"\n\n\"Then, doctor, there's to be neither rain nor wind, at least for us!\"\n\n\"I fear so; the cloud keeps at a great height.\"\n\n\"Well, doctor, suppose we were to go in pursuit of this cloud, since it\nrefuses to burst upon us?\"\n\n\"I fancy that to do so wouldn't help us much; it would be a consumption\nof gas, and, consequently, of water, to little purpose; but, in our\nsituation, we must not leave anything untried; therefore, let us\nascend!\"\n\nAnd with this, the doctor put on a full head of flame from the cylinder,\nand the dilation of the hydrogen, occasioned by such sudden and intense\nheat, sent the balloon rapidly aloft.\n\nAbout fifteen hundred feet from the ground, it encountered an opaque\nmass of cloud, and entered a dense fog, suspended at that elevation;\nbut it did not meet with the least breath of wind. This fog seemed even\ndestitute of humidity, and the articles brought in contact with it\nwere scarcely dampened in the slightest degree. The balloon, completely\nenveloped in the vapor, gained a little increase of speed, perhaps, and\nthat was all.\n\nThe doctor gloomily recognized what trifling success he had obtained\nfrom his manoeuvre, and was relapsing into deep meditation, when he\nheard Joe exclaim, in tones of most intense astonishment:\n\n\"Ah! by all that's beautiful!\"\n\n\"What's the matter, Joe?\"\n\n\"Doctor! Mr. Kennedy! Here's something curious!\"\n\n\"What is it, then?\"\n\n\"We are not alone, up here! There are rogues about! They've stolen our\ninvention!\"\n\n\"Has he gone crazy?\" asked Kennedy.\n\nJoe stood there, perfectly motionless, the very picture of amazement.\n\n\"Can the hot sun have really affected the poor fellow's brain?\" said the\ndoctor, turning toward him.\n\n\"Will you tell me?--\"\n\n\"Look!\" said Joe, pointing to a certain quarter of the sky.\n\n\"By St. James!\" exclaimed Kennedy, in turn, \"why, who would have\nbelieved it? Look, look! doctor!\"\n\n\"I see it!\" said the doctor, very quietly.\n\n\"Another balloon! and other passengers, like ourselves!\"\n\nAnd, sure enough, there was another balloon about two hundred paces\nfrom them, floating in the air with its car and its aeronauts. It was\nfollowing exactly the same route as the Victoria.\n\n\"Well,\" said the doctor, \"nothing remains for us but to make signals;\ntake the flag, Kennedy, and show them our colors.\"\n\nIt seemed that the travellers by the other balloon had just the same\nidea, at the same moment, for the same kind of flag repeated precisely\nthe same salute with a hand that moved in just the same manner.\n\n\"What does that mean?\" asked Kennedy.\n\n\"They are apes,\" said Joe, \"imitating us.\"\n\n\"It means,\" said the doctor, laughing, \"that it is you, Dick, yourself,\nmaking that signal to yourself; or, in other words, that we see\nourselves in the second balloon, which is no other than the Victoria.\"\n\n\"As to that, master, with all respect to you,\" said Joe, \"you'll never\nmake me believe it.\"\n\n\"Climb up on the edge of the car, Joe; wave your arms, and then you'll\nsee.\"\n\nJoe obeyed, and all his gestures were instantaneously and exactly\nrepeated.\n\n\"It is merely the effect of the MIRAGE,\" said the doctor, \"and nothing\nelse--a simple optical phenomenon due to the unequal refraction of light\nby different layers of the atmosphere, and that is all.\n\n\"It's wonderful,\" said Joe, who could not make up his mind to surrender,\nbut went on repeating his gesticulations.\n\n\"What a curious sight! Do you know,\" said Kennedy, \"that it's a real\npleasure to have a view of our noble balloon in that style? She's a\nbeauty, isn't she?--and how stately her movements as she sweeps along!\"\n\n\"You may explain the matter as you like,\" continued Joe, \"it's a strange\nthing, anyhow!\"\n\nBut ere long this picture began to fade away; the clouds rose higher,\nleaving the balloon, which made no further attempt to follow them, and\nin about an hour they disappeared in the open sky.\n\nThe wind, which had been scarcely perceptible, seemed still to diminish,\nand the doctor in perfect desperation descended toward the ground, and\nall three of the travellers, whom the incident just recorded had, for\na few moments, diverted from their anxieties, relapsed into gloomy\nmeditation, sweltering the while beneath the scorching heat.\n\nAbout four o'clock, Joe descried some object standing out against the\nvast background of sand, and soon was able to declare positively that\nthere were two palm-trees at no great distance.\n\n\"Palm-trees!\" exclaimed Ferguson; \"why, then there's a spring--a well!\"\n\nHe took up his glass and satisfied himself that Joe's eyes had not been\nmistaken.\n\n\"At length!\" he said, over and over again, \"water! water! and we are\nsaved; for if we do move slowly, still we move, and we shall arrive at\nlast!\"\n\n\"Good, master! but suppose we were to drink a mouthful in the mean time,\nfor this air is stifling?\"\n\n\"Let us drink then, my boy!\"\n\nNo one waited to be coaxed. A whole pint was swallowed then and there,\nreducing the total remaining supply to three pints and a half.\n\n\"Ah! that does one good!\" said Joe; \"wasn't it fine? Barclay and Perkins\nnever turned out ale equal to that!\"\n\n\"See the advantage of being put on short allowance!\" moralized the\ndoctor.\n\n\"It is not great, after all,\" retorted Kennedy; \"and if I were never\nagain to have the pleasure of drinking water, I should agree on\ncondition that I should never be deprived of it.\"\n\nAt six o'clock the balloon was floating over the palm-trees.\n\nThey were two shrivelled, stunted, dried-up specimens of trees--two\nghosts of palms--without foliage, and more dead than alive. Ferguson\nexamined them with terror.\n\nAt their feet could be seen the half-worn stones of a spring, but these\nstones, pulverized by the baking heat of the sun, seemed to be nothing\nnow but impalpable dust. There was not the slightest sign of moisture.\nThe doctor's heart shrank within him, and he was about to communicate\nhis thoughts to his companions, when their exclamations attracted his\nattention. As far as the eye could reach to the eastward, extended\na long line of whitened bones; pieces of skeletons surrounded the\nfountain; a caravan had evidently made its way to that point, marking\nits progress by its bleaching remains; the weaker had fallen one by one\nupon the sand; the stronger, having at length reached this spring for\nwhich they panted, had there found a horrible death.\n\nOur travellers looked at each other and turned pale.\n\n\"Let us not alight!\" said Kennedy, \"let us fly from this hideous\nspectacle! There's not a drop of water here!\"\n\n\"No, Dick, as well pass the night here as elsewhere; let us have a clear\nconscience in the matter. We'll dig down to the very bottom of the well.\nThere has been a spring here, and perhaps there's something left in it!\"\n\nThe Victoria touched the ground; Joe and Kennedy put into the car\na quantity of sand equal to their weight, and leaped out. They then\nhastened to the well, and penetrated to the interior by a flight of\nsteps that was now nothing but dust. The spring appeared to have been\ndry for years. They dug down into a parched and powdery sand--the very\ndryest of all sand, indeed--there was not one trace of moisture!\n\nThe doctor saw them come up to the surface of the desert, saturated with\nperspiration, worn out, covered with fine dust, exhausted, discouraged\nand despairing.\n\nHe then comprehended that their search had been fruitless. He had\nexpected as much, and he kept silent, for he felt that, from this moment\nforth, he must have courage and energy enough for three.\n\nJoe brought up with him some pieces of a leathern bottle that had grown\nhard and horn-like with age, and angrily flung them away among the\nbleaching bones of the caravan.\n\nAt supper, not a word was spoken by our travellers, and they even ate\nwithout appetite. Yet they had not, up to this moment, endured the real\nagonies of thirst, and were in no desponding mood, excepting for the\nfuture.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SIXTH.\n\nOne Hundred and Thirteen Degrees.--The Doctor's Reflections.--A\nDesperate Search.--The Cylinder goes out.--One Hundred and\nTwenty-two Degrees.--Contemplation of the Desert.--A Night\nWalk.--Solitude.--Debility.--Joe's Prospects.--He gives himself One Day\nmore.\n\nThe distance made by the balloon during the preceding day did not exceed\nten miles, and, to keep it afloat, one hundred and sixty-two cubic feet\nof gas had been consumed.\n\nOn Saturday morning the doctor again gave the signal for departure.\n\n\"The cylinder can work only six hours longer; and, if in that time we\nshall not have found either a well or a spring of water, God alone knows\nwhat will become of us!\"\n\n\"Not much wind this morning, master,\" said Joe; \"but it will come\nup, perhaps,\" he added, suddenly remarking the doctor's ill-concealed\ndepression.\n\nVain hope! The atmosphere was in a dead calm--one of those calms which\nhold vessels captive in tropical seas. The heat had become intolerable;\nand the thermometer, in the shade under the awning, indicated one\nhundred and thirteen degrees.\n\nJoe and Kennedy, reclining at full length near each other, tried, if\nnot in slumber, at least in torpor, to forget their situation, for their\nforced inactivity gave them periods of leisure far from pleasant.\nThat man is to be pitied the most who cannot wean himself from gloomy\nreflections by actual work, or some practical pursuit. But here there\nwas nothing to look after, nothing to undertake, and they had to submit\nto the situation, without having it in their power to ameliorate it.\n\nThe pangs of thirst began to be severely felt; brandy, far from\nappeasing this imperious necessity, augmented it, and richly merited the\nname of \"tiger's milk\" applied to it by the African natives. Scarcely\ntwo pints of water remained, and that was heated. Each of the party\ndevoured the few precious drops with his gaze, yet neither of them dared\nto moisten his lips with them. Two pints of water in the midst of the\ndesert!\n\nThen it was that Dr. Ferguson, buried in meditation, asked himself\nwhether he had acted with prudence. Would he not have done better to\nhave kept the water that he had decomposed in pure loss, in order to\nsustain him in the air? He had gained a little distance, to be sure; but\nwas he any nearer to his journey's end? What difference did sixty miles\nto the rear make in this region, when there was no water to be had where\nthey were? The wind, should it rise, would blow there as it did here,\nonly less strongly at this point, if it came from the east. But hope\nurged him onward. And yet those two gallons of water, expended in vain,\nwould have sufficed for nine days' halt in the desert. And what changes\nmight not have occurred in nine days! Perhaps, too, while retaining\nthe water, he might have ascended by throwing out ballast, at the cost\nmerely of discharging some gas, when he had again to descend. But the\ngas in his balloon was his blood, his very life!\n\nA thousand one such reflections whirled in succession through his brain;\nand, resting his head between his hands, he sat there for hours without\nraising it.\n\n\"We must make one final effort,\" he said, at last, about ten o'clock in\nthe morning. \"We must endeavor, just once more, to find an atmospheric\ncurrent to bear us away from here, and, to that end, must risk our last\nresources.\"\n\nTherefore, while his companions slept, the doctor raised the hydrogen in\nthe balloon to an elevated temperature, and the huge globe, filling out\nby the dilation of the gas, rose straight up in the perpendicular rays\nof the sun. The doctor searched vainly for a breath of wind, from the\nheight of one hundred feet to that of five miles; his starting-point\nremained fatally right below him, and absolute calm seemed to reign, up\nto the extreme limits of the breathing atmosphere.\n\nAt length the feeding-supply of water gave out; the cylinder was\nextinguished for lack of gas; the Buntzen battery ceased to work, and\nthe balloon, shrinking together, gently descended to the sand, in the\nvery place that the car had hollowed out there.\n\nIt was noon; and solar observations gave nineteen degrees thirty-five\nminutes east longitude, and six degrees fifty-one minutes north\nlatitude, or nearly five hundred miles from Lake Tchad, and more than\nfour hundred miles from the western coast of Africa.\n\nOn the balloon taking ground, Kennedy and Joe awoke from their stupor.\n\n\"We have halted,\" said the Scot.\n\n\"We had to do so,\" replied the doctor, gravely.\n\nHis companions understood him. The level of the soil at that point\ncorresponded with the level of the sea, and, consequently, the balloon\nremained in perfect equilibrium, and absolutely motionless.\n\nThe weight of the three travellers was replaced with an equivalent\nquantity of sand, and they got out of the car. Each was absorbed in his\nown thoughts; and for many hours neither of them spoke. Joe prepared\ntheir evening meal, which consisted of biscuit and pemmican, and was\nhardly tasted by either of the party. A mouthful of scalding water from\ntheir little store completed this gloomy repast.\n\nDuring the night none of them kept awake; yet none could be precisely\nsaid to have slept. On the morrow there remained only half a pint of\nwater, and this the doctor put away, all three having resolved not to\ntouch it until the last extremity.\n\nIt was not long, however, before Joe exclaimed:\n\n\"I'm choking, and the heat is getting worse! I'm not surprised at that,\nthough,\" he added, consulting the thermometer; \"one hundred and forty\ndegrees!\"\n\n\"The sand scorches me,\" said the hunter, \"as though it had just come out\nof a furnace; and not a cloud in this sky of fire. It's enough to drive\none mad!\"\n\n\"Let us not despair,\" responded the doctor. \"In this latitude these\nintense heats are invariably followed by storms, and the latter come\nwith the suddenness of lightning. Notwithstanding this disheartening\nclearness of the sky, great atmospheric changes may take place in less\nthan an hour.\"\n\n\"But,\" asked Kennedy, \"is there any sign whatever of that?\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied the doctor, \"I think that there is some slight symptom\nof a fall in the barometer.\"\n\n\"May Heaven hearken to you, Samuel! for here we are pinned to the\nground, like a bird with broken wings.\"\n\n\"With this difference, however, my dear Dick, that our wings are unhurt,\nand I hope that we shall be able to use them again.\"\n\n\"Ah! wind! wind!\" exclaimed Joe; \"enough to carry us to a stream or\na well, and we'll be all right. We have provisions enough, and, with\nwater, we could wait a month without suffering; but thirst is a cruel\nthing!\"\n\nIt was not thirst alone, but the unchanging sight of the desert, that\nfatigued the mind. There was not a variation in the surface of the soil,\nnot a hillock of sand, not a pebble, to relieve the gaze. This unbroken\nlevel discouraged the beholder, and gave him that kind of malady called\nthe \"desert-sickness.\" The impassible monotony of the arid blue sky,\nand the vast yellow expanse of the desert-sand, at length produced a\nsensation of terror. In this inflamed atmosphere the heat appeared to\nvibrate as it does above a blazing hearth, while the mind grew desperate\nin contemplating the limitless calm, and could see no reason why the\nthing should ever end, since immensity is a species of eternity.\n\nThus, at last, our hapless travellers, deprived of water in this torrid\nheat, began to feel symptoms of mental disorder. Their eyes swelled in\ntheir sockets, and their gaze became confused.\n\nWhen night came on, the doctor determined to combat this alarming\ntendency by rapid walking. His idea was to pace the sandy plain for a\nfew hours, not in search of any thing, but simply for exercise.\n\n\"Come along!\" he said to his companions; \"believe me, it will do you\ngood.\"\n\n\"Out of the question!\" said Kennedy; \"I could not walk a step.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said Joe, \"would rather sleep!\"\n\n\"But sleep, or even rest, would be dangerous to you, my friends; you\nmust react against this tendency to stupor. Come with me!\"\n\nBut the doctor could do nothing with them, and, therefore, set off\nalone, amid the starry clearness of the night. The first few steps he\ntook were painful, for they were the steps of an enfeebled man quite out\nof practice in walking. However, he quickly saw that the exercise would\nbe beneficial to him, and pushed on several miles to the westward. Once\nin rapid motion, he felt his spirits greatly cheered, when, suddenly, a\nvertigo came over him; he seemed to be poised on the edge of an abyss;\nhis knees bent under him; the vast solitude struck terror to his\nheart; he found himself the minute mathematical point, the centre of\nan infinite circumference, that is to say--a nothing! The balloon\nhad disappeared entirely in the deepening gloom. The doctor, cool,\nimpassible, reckless explorer that he was, felt himself at last seized\nwith a nameless dread. He strove to retrace his steps, but in vain. He\ncalled aloud. Not even an echo replied, and his voice died out in\nthe empty vastness of surrounding space, like a pebble cast into a\nbottomless gulf; then, down he sank, fainting, on the sand, alone, amid\nthe eternal silence of the desert.\n\nAt midnight he came to, in the arms of his faithful follower, Joe. The\nlatter, uneasy at his master's prolonged absence, had set out after him,\neasily tracing him by the clear imprint of his feet in the sand, and had\nfound him lying in a swoon.\n\n\"What has been the matter, sir?\" was the first inquiry.\n\n\"Nothing, Joe, nothing! Only a touch of weakness, that's all. It's over\nnow.\"\n\n\"Oh! it won't amount to any thing, sir, I'm sure of that; but get up on\nyour feet, if you can. There! lean upon me, and let us get back to the\nballoon.\"\n\nAnd the doctor, leaning on Joe's arm, returned along the track by which\nhe had come.\n\n\"You were too bold, sir; it won't do to run such risks. You might have\nbeen robbed,\" he added, laughing. \"But, sir, come now, let us talk\nseriously.\"\n\n\"Speak! I am listening to you.\"\n\n\"We must positively make up our minds to do something. Our present\nsituation cannot last more than a few days longer, and if we get no\nwind, we are lost.\"\n\nThe doctor made no reply.\n\n\"Well, then, one of us must sacrifice himself for the good of all, and\nit is most natural that it should fall to me to do so.\"\n\n\"What have you to propose? What is your plan?\"\n\n\"A very simple one! It is to take provisions enough, and to walk right\non until I come to some place, as I must do, sooner or later. In the\nmean time, if Heaven sends you a good wind, you need not wait, but\ncan start again. For my part, if I come to a village, I'll work my way\nthrough with a few Arabic words that you can write for me on a slip of\npaper, and I'll bring you help or lose my hide. What do you think of my\nplan?\"\n\n\"It is absolute folly, Joe, but worthy of your noble heart. The thing is\nimpossible. You will not leave us.\"\n\n\"But, sir, we must do something, and this plan can't do you any\nharm, for, I say again, you need not wait; and then, after all, I may\nsucceed.\"\n\n\"No, Joe, no! We will not separate. That would only be adding sorrow to\ntrouble. It was written that matters should be as they are; and it is\nvery probably written that it shall be quite otherwise by-and-by. Let us\nwait, then, with resignation.\"\n\n\"So be it, master; but take notice of one thing: I give you a day\nlonger, and I'll not wait after that. To-day is Sunday; we might say\nMonday, as it is one o'clock in the morning, and if we don't get off by\nTuesday, I'll run the risk. I've made up my mind to that!\"\n\nThe doctor made no answer, and in a few minutes they got back to the\ncar, where he took his place beside Kennedy, who lay there plunged in\nsilence so complete that it could not be considered sleep.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SEVENTH.\n\nTerrific Heat.--Hallucinations.--The Last Drops of Water.--Nights of\nDespair.--An Attempt at Suicide.--The Simoom.--The Oasis.--The Lion and\nLioness.\n\nThe doctor's first care, on the morrow, was to consult the barometer.\nHe found that the mercury had scarcely undergone any perceptible\ndepression.\n\n\"Nothing!\" he murmured, \"nothing!\"\n\nHe got out of the car and scrutinized the weather; there was only the\nsame heat, the same cloudless sky, the same merciless drought.\n\n\"Must we, then, give up to despair?\" he exclaimed, in agony.\n\nJoe did not open his lips. He was buried in his own thoughts, and\nplanning the expedition he had proposed.\n\nKennedy got up, feeling very ill, and a prey to nervous agitation. He\nwas suffering horribly with thirst, and his swollen tongue and lips\ncould hardly articulate a syllable.\n\nThere still remained a few drops of water. Each of them knew this, and\neach was thinking of it, and felt himself drawn toward them; but neither\nof the three dared to take a step.\n\nThose three men, friends and companions as they were, fixed their\nhaggard eyes upon each other with an instinct of ferocious longing,\nwhich was most plainly revealed in the hardy Scot, whose vigorous\nconstitution yielded the soonest to these unnatural privations.\n\nThroughout the day he was delirious, pacing up and down, uttering hoarse\ncries, gnawing his clinched fists, and ready to open his veins and drink\nhis own hot blood.\n\n\"Ah!\" he cried, \"land of thirst! Well might you be called the land of\ndespair!\"\n\nAt length he sank down in utter prostration, and his friends heard no\nother sound from him than the hissing of his breath between his parched\nand swollen lips.\n\nToward evening, Joe had his turn of delirium. The vast expanse of sand\nappeared to him an immense pond, full of clear and limpid water; and,\nmore than once, he dashed himself upon the scorching waste to drink long\ndraughts, and rose again with his mouth clogged with hot dust.\n\n\"Curses on it!\" he yelled, in his madness, \"it's nothing but salt\nwater!\"\n\nThen, while Ferguson and Kennedy lay there motionless, the resistless\nlonging came over him to drain the last few drops of water that had\nbeen kept in reserve. The natural instinct proved too strong. He dragged\nhimself toward the car, on his knees; he glared at the bottle containing\nthe precious fluid; he gave one wild, eager glance, seized the treasured\nstore, and bore it to his lips.\n\nAt that instant he heard a heart-rending cry close beside him--\"Water!\nwater!\"\n\nIt was Kennedy, who had crawled up close to him, and was begging there,\nupon his knees, and weeping piteously.\n\nJoe, himself in tears, gave the poor wretch the bottle, and Kennedy\ndrained the last drop with savage haste.\n\n\"Thanks!\" he murmured hoarsely, but Joe did not hear him, for both alike\nhad dropped fainting on the sand.\n\nWhat took place during that fearful night neither of them knew, but, on\nTuesday morning, under those showers of heat which the sun poured down\nupon them, the unfortunate men felt their limbs gradually drying up, and\nwhen Joe attempted to rise he found it impossible.\n\nHe looked around him. In the car, the doctor, completely overwhelmed,\nsat with his arms folded on his breast, gazing with idiotic fixedness\nupon some imaginary point in space. Kennedy was frightful to behold. He\nwas rolling his head from right to left like a wild beast in a cage.\n\nAll at once, his eyes rested on the butt of his rifle, which jutted\nabove the rim of the car.\n\n\"Ah!\" he screamed, raising himself with a superhuman effort.\n\nDesperate, mad, he snatched at the weapon, and turned the barrel toward\nhis mouth.\n\n\"Kennedy!\" shouted Joe, throwing himself upon his friend.\n\n\"Let go! hands off!\" moaned the Scot, in a hoarse, grating voice--and\nthen the two struggled desperately for the rifle.\n\n\"Let go, or I'll kill you!\" repeated Kennedy. But Joe clung to him only\nthe more fiercely, and they had been contending thus without the doctor\nseeing them for many seconds, when, suddenly the rifle went off. At the\nsound of its discharge, the doctor rose up erect, like a spectre, and\nglared around him.\n\nBut all at once his glance grew more animated; he extended his hand\ntoward the horizon, and in a voice no longer human shrieked:\n\n\"There! there--off there!\"\n\nThere was such fearful force in the cry that Kennedy and Joe released\neach other, and both looked where the doctor pointed.\n\nThe plain was agitated like the sea shaken by the fury of a tempest;\nbillows of sand went tossing over each other amid blinding clouds of\ndust; an immense pillar was seen whirling toward them through the air\nfrom the southeast, with terrific velocity; the sun was disappearing\nbehind an opaque veil of cloud whose enormous barrier extended clear to\nthe horizon, while the grains of fine sand went gliding together with\nall the supple ease of liquid particles, and the rising dust-tide gained\nmore and more with every second.\n\nFerguson's eyes gleamed with a ray of energetic hope.\n\n\"The simoom!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"The simoom!\" repeated Joe, without exactly knowing what it meant.\n\n\"So much the better!\" said Kennedy, with the bitterness of despair. \"So\nmuch the better--we shall die!\"\n\n\"So much the better!\" echoed the doctor, \"for we shall live!\" and, so\nsaying, he began rapidly to throw out the sand that encumbered the car.\n\nAt length his companions understood him, and took their places at his\nside.\n\n\"And now, Joe,\" said the doctor, \"throw out some fifty pounds of your\nore, there!\"\n\nJoe no longer hesitated, although he still felt a fleeting pang of\nregret. The balloon at once began to ascend.\n\n\"It was high time!\" said the doctor.\n\nThe simoom, in fact, came rushing on like a thunderbolt, and a moment\nlater the balloon would have been crushed, torn to atoms, annihilated.\nThe awful whirlwind was almost upon it, and it was already pelted with\nshowers of sand driven like hail by the storm.\n\n\"Out with more ballast!\" shouted the doctor.\n\n\"There!\" responded Joe, tossing over a huge fragment of quartz.\n\nWith this, the Victoria rose swiftly above the range of the whirling\ncolumn, but, caught in the vast displacement of the atmosphere thereby\noccasioned, it was borne along with incalculable rapidity away above\nthis foaming sea.\n\nThe three travellers did not speak. They gazed, and hoped, and even felt\nrefreshed by the breath of the tempest.\n\nAbout three o'clock, the whirlwind ceased; the sand, falling again upon\nthe desert, formed numberless little hillocks, and the sky resumed its\nformer tranquillity.\n\nThe balloon, which had again lost its momentum, was floating in sight of\nan oasis, a sort of islet studded with green trees, thrown up upon the\nsurface of this sandy ocean.\n\n\"Water! we'll find water there!\" said the doctor.\n\nAnd, instantly, opening the upper valve, he let some hydrogen escape,\nand slowly descended, taking the ground at about two hundred feet from\nthe edge of the oasis.\n\nIn four hours the travellers had swept over a distance of two hundred\nand forty miles!\n\nThe car was at once ballasted, and Kennedy, closely followed by Joe,\nleaped out.\n\n\"Take your guns with you!\" said the doctor; \"take your guns, and be\ncareful!\"\n\nDick grasped his rifle, and Joe took one of the fowling-pieces. They\nthen rapidly made for the trees, and disappeared under the fresh\nverdure, which announced the presence of abundant springs. As they\nhurried on, they had not taken notice of certain large footprints and\nfresh tracks of some living creature marked here and there in the damp\nsoil.\n\nSuddenly, a dull roar was heard not twenty paces from them.\n\n\"The roar of a lion!\" said Joe.\n\n\"Good for that!\" said the excited hunter; \"we'll fight him. A man feels\nstrong when only a fight's in question.\"\n\n\"But be careful, Mr. Kennedy; be careful! The lives of all depend upon\nthe life of one.\"\n\nBut Kennedy no longer heard him; he was pushing on, his eye blazing; his\nrifle cocked; fearful to behold in his daring rashness. There, under a\npalm-tree, stood an enormous black-maned lion, crouching for a spring on\nhis antagonist. Scarcely had he caught a glimpse of the hunter, when he\nbounded through the air; but he had not touched the ground ere a bullet\npierced his heart, and he fell to the earth dead.\n\n\"Hurrah! hurrah!\" shouted Joe, with wild exultation.\n\nKennedy rushed toward the well, slid down the dampened steps, and\nflung himself at full length by the side of a fresh spring, in which\nhe plunged his parched lips. Joe followed suit, and for some minutes\nnothing was heard but the sound they made with their mouths, drinking\nmore like maddened beasts than men.\n\n\"Take care, Mr. Kennedy,\" said Joe at last; \"let us not overdo the\nthing!\" and he panted for breath.\n\nBut Kennedy, without a word, drank on. He even plunged his hands,\nand then his head, into the delicious tide--he fairly revelled in its\ncoolness.\n\n\"But the doctor?\" said Joe; \"our friend, Dr. Ferguson?\"\n\nThat one word recalled Kennedy to himself, and, hastily filling a flask\nthat he had brought with him, he started on a run up the steps of the\nwell.\n\nBut what was his amazement when he saw an opaque body of enormous\ndimensions blocking up the passage! Joe, who was close upon Kennedy's\nheels, recoiled with him.\n\n\"We are blocked in--entrapped!\"\n\n\"Impossible! What does that mean?--\"\n\nDick had no time to finish; a terrific roar made him only too quickly\naware what foe confronted him.\n\n\"Another lion!\" exclaimed Joe.\n\n\"A lioness, rather,\" said Kennedy. \"Ah! ferocious brute!\" he added,\n\"I'll settle you in a moment more!\" and swiftly reloaded his rifle.\n\nIn another instant he fired, but the animal had disappeared.\n\n\"Onward!\" shouted Kennedy.\n\n\"No!\" interposed the other, \"that shot did not kill her; her body would\nhave rolled down the steps; she's up there, ready to spring upon the\nfirst of us who appears, and he would be a lost man!\"\n\n\"But what are we to do? We must get out of this, and the doctor is\nexpecting us.\"\n\n\"Let us decoy the animal. Take my piece, and give me your rifle.\"\n\n\"What is your plan?\"\n\n\"You'll see.\"\n\nAnd Joe, taking off his linen jacket, hung it on the end of the rifle,\nand thrust it above the top of the steps. The lioness flung herself\nfuriously upon it. Kennedy was on the alert for her, and his bullet\nbroke her shoulder. The lioness, with a frightful howl of agony, rolled\ndown the steps, overturning Joe in her fall. The poor fellow imagined\nthat he could already feel the enormous paws of the savage beast in his\nflesh, when a second detonation resounded in the narrow passage, and Dr.\nFerguson appeared at the opening above with his gun in hand, and still\nsmoking from the discharge.\n\nJoe leaped to his feet, clambered over the body of the dead lioness, and\nhanded up the flask full of sparkling water to his master.\n\nTo carry it to his lips, and to half empty it at a draught, was the\nwork of an instant, and the three travellers offered up thanks from the\ndepths of their hearts to that Providence who had so miraculously saved\nthem.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHTH.\n\nAn Evening of Delight.--Joe's Culinary Performance.--A Dissertation\non Raw Meat.--The Narrative of James Bruce.--Camping out.--Joe's\nDreams.--The Barometer begins to fall.--The Barometer rises\nagain.--Preparations for Departure.--The Tempest.\n\nThe evening was lovely, and our three friends enjoyed it in the cool\nshade of the mimosas, after a substantial repast, at which the tea and\nthe punch were dealt out with no niggardly hand.\n\nKennedy had traversed the little domain in all directions. He had\nransacked every thicket and satisfied himself that the balloon party\nwere the only living creatures in this terrestrial paradise; so they\nstretched themselves upon their blankets and passed a peaceful night\nthat brought them forgetfulness of their past sufferings.\n\nOn the morrow, May 7th, the sun shone with all his splendor, but his\nrays could not penetrate the dense screen of the palm-tree foliage, and\nas there was no lack of provisions, the doctor resolved to remain where\nhe was while waiting for a favorable wind.\n\nJoe had conveyed his portable kitchen to the oasis, and proceeded to\nindulge in any number of culinary combinations, using water all the time\nwith the most profuse extravagance.\n\n\"What a strange succession of annoyances and enjoyments!\" moralized\nKennedy. \"Such abundance as this after such privations; such luxury\nafter such want! Ah! I nearly went mad!\"\n\n\"My dear Dick,\" replied the doctor, \"had it not been for Joe, you would\nnot be sitting here, to-day, discoursing on the instability of human\naffairs.\"\n\n\"Whole-hearted friend!\" said Kennedy, extending his hand to Joe.\n\n\"There's no occasion for all that,\" responded the latter; \"but you can\ntake your revenge some time, Mr. Kennedy, always hoping though that you\nmay never have occasion to do the same for me!\"\n\n\"It's a poor constitution this of ours to succumb to so little,\"\nphilosophized Dr. Ferguson.\n\n\"So little water, you mean, doctor,\" interposed Joe; \"that element must\nbe very necessary to life.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly, and persons deprived of food hold out longer than those\ndeprived of water.\"\n\n\"I believe it. Besides, when needs must, one can eat any thing he comes\nacross, even his fellow-creatures, although that must be a kind of food\nthat's pretty hard to digest.\"\n\n\"The savages don't boggle much about it!\" said Kennedy.\n\n\"Yes; but then they are savages, and accustomed to devouring raw meat;\nit's something that I'd find very disgusting, for my part.\"\n\n\"It is disgusting enough,\" said the doctor, \"that's a fact; and so\nmuch so, indeed, that nobody believed the narratives of the earliest\ntravellers in Africa who brought back word that many tribes on that\ncontinent subsisted upon raw meat, and people generally refused to\ncredit the statement. It was under such circumstances that a very\nsingular adventure befell James Bruce.\"\n\n\"Tell it to us, doctor; we've time enough to hear it,\" said Joe,\nstretching himself voluptuously on the cool greensward.\n\n\"By all means.--James Bruce was a Scotchman, of Stirlingshire, who,\nbetween 1768 and 1772, traversed all Abyssinia, as far as Lake Tyana, in\nsearch of the sources of the Nile. He afterward returned to England, but\ndid not publish an account of his journeys until 1790. His statements\nwere received with extreme incredulity, and such may be the reception\naccorded to our own. The manners and customs of the Abyssinians seemed\nso different from those of the English, that no one would credit the\ndescription of them. Among other details, Bruce had put forward the\nassertion that the tribes of Eastern Africa fed upon raw flesh, and this\nset everybody against him. He might say so as much as he pleased; there\nwas no one likely to go and see! One day, in a parlor at Edinburgh, a\nScotch gentleman took up the subject in his presence, as it had become\nthe topic of daily pleasantry, and, in reference to the eating of raw\nflesh, said that the thing was neither possible nor true. Bruce made no\nreply, but went out and returned a few minutes later with a raw steak,\nseasoned with pepper and salt, in the African style.\n\n\"'Sir,' said he to the Scotchman, 'in doubting my statements, you have\ngrossly affronted me; in believing the thing to be impossible, you have\nbeen egregiously mistaken; and, in proof thereof, you will now eat this\nbeef-steak raw, or you will give me instant satisfaction!' The Scotchman\nhad a wholesome dread of the brawny traveller, and DID eat the steak,\nalthough not without a good many wry faces. Thereupon, with the utmost\ncoolness, James Bruce added: 'Even admitting, sir, that the thing were\nuntrue, you will, at least, no longer maintain that it is impossible.'\"\n\n\"Well put in!\" said Joe, \"and if the Scotchman found it lie heavy on his\nstomach, he got no more than he deserved. If, on our return to England,\nthey dare to doubt what we say about our travels--\"\n\n\"Well, Joe, what would you do?\"\n\n\"Why, I'll make the doubters swallow the pieces of the balloon, without\neither salt or pepper!\"\n\nAll burst out laughing at Joe's queer notions, and thus the day slipped\nby in pleasant chat. With returning strength, hope had revived, and with\nhope came the courage to do and to dare. The past was obliterated in the\npresence of the future with providential rapidity.\n\nJoe would have been willing to remain forever in this enchanting asylum;\nit was the realm he had pictured in his dreams; he felt himself at\nhome; his master had to give him his exact location, and it was with the\ngravest air imaginable that he wrote down on his tablets fifteen degrees\nforty-three minutes east longitude, and eight degrees thirty-two minutes\nnorth latitude.\n\nKennedy had but one regret, to wit, that he could not hunt in that\nminiature forest, because, according to his ideas, there was a slight\ndeficiency of ferocious wild beasts in it.\n\n\"But, my dear Dick,\" said the doctor, \"haven't you rather a short\nmemory? How about the lion and the lioness?\"\n\n\"Oh, that!\" he ejaculated with the contempt of a thorough-bred sportsman\nfor game already killed. \"But the fact is, that finding them here would\nlead one to suppose that we can't be far from a more fertile country.\"\n\n\"It don't prove much, Dick, for those animals, when goaded by hunger or\nthirst, will travel long distances, and I think that, to-night, we had\nbetter keep a more vigilant lookout, and light fires, besides.\"\n\n\"What, in such heat as this?\" said Joe. \"Well, if it's necessary, we'll\nhave to do it, but I do think it a real pity to burn this pretty grove\nthat has been such a comfort to us!\"\n\n\"Oh! above all things, we must take the utmost care not to set it\non fire,\" replied the doctor, \"so that others in the same strait as\nourselves may some day find shelter here in the middle of the desert.\"\n\n\"I'll be very careful, indeed, doctor; but do you think that this oasis\nis known?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly; it is a halting-place for the caravans that frequent the\ncentre of Africa, and a visit from one of them might be any thing but\npleasant to you, Joe.\"\n\n\"Why, are there any more of those rascally Nyam-Nyams around here?\"\n\n\"Certainly; that is the general name of all the neighboring tribes,\nand, under the same climates, the same races are likely to have similar\nmanners and customs.\"\n\n\"Pah!\" said Joe, \"but, after all, it's natural enough. If savages had\nthe ways of gentlemen, where would be the difference? By George, these\nfine fellows wouldn't have to be coaxed long to eat the Scotchman's raw\nsteak, nor the Scotchman either, into the bargain!\"\n\nWith this very sensible observation, Joe began to get ready his firewood\nfor the night, making just as little of it as possible. Fortunately,\nthese precautions were superfluous; and each of the party, in his turn,\ndropped off into the soundest slumber.\n\nOn the next day the weather still showed no sign of change, but kept\nprovokingly and obstinately fair. The balloon remained motionless,\nwithout any oscillation to betray a breath of wind.\n\nThe doctor began to get uneasy again. If their stay in the desert were\nto be prolonged like this, their provisions would give out. After nearly\nperishing for want of water, they would, at last, have to starve to\ndeath!\n\nBut he took fresh courage as he saw the mercury fall considerably in\nthe barometer, and noticed evident signs of an early change in the\natmosphere. He therefore resolved to make all his preparations for a\nstart, so as to avail himself of the first opportunity. The feeding-tank\nand the water-tank were both completely filled.\n\nThen he had to reestablish the equilibrium of the balloon, and Joe\nwas obliged to part with another considerable portion of his precious\nquartz. With restored health, his ambitious notions had come back to\nhim, and he made more than one wry face before obeying his master;\nbut the latter convinced him that he could not carry so considerable\na weight with him through the air, and gave him his choice between the\nwater and the gold. Joe hesitated no longer, but flung out the requisite\nquantity of his much-prized ore upon the sand.\n\n\"The next people who come this way,\" he remarked, \"will be rather\nsurprised to find a fortune in such a place.\"\n\n\"And suppose some learned traveller should come across these specimens,\neh?\" suggested Kennedy.\n\n\"You may be certain, Dick, that they would take him by surprise, and\nthat he would publish his astonishment in several folios; so that some\nday we shall hear of a wonderful deposit of gold-bearing quartz in the\nmidst of the African sands!\"\n\n\"And Joe there, will be the cause of it all!\"\n\nThis idea of mystifying some learned sage tickled Joe hugely, and made\nhim laugh.\n\nDuring the rest of the day the doctor vainly kept on the watch for a\nchange of weather. The temperature rose, and, had it not been for the\nshade of the oasis, would have been insupportable. The thermometer\nmarked a hundred and forty-nine degrees in the sun, and a veritable rain\nof fire filled the air. This was the most intense heat that they had yet\nnoted.\n\nJoe arranged their bivouac for that evening, as he had done for the\nprevious night; and during the watches kept by the doctor and Kennedy\nthere was no fresh incident.\n\nBut, toward three o'clock in the morning, while Joe was on guard, the\ntemperature suddenly fell; the sky became overcast with clouds, and the\ndarkness increased.\n\n\"Turn out!\" cried Joe, arousing his companions. \"Turn out! Here's the\nwind!\"\n\n\"At last!\" exclaimed the doctor, eying the heavens. \"But it is a storm!\nThe balloon! Let us hasten to the balloon!\"\n\nIt was high time for them to reach it. The Victoria was bending to the\nforce of the hurricane, and dragging along the car, the latter grazing\nthe sand. Had any portion of the ballast been accidentally thrown out,\nthe balloon would have been swept away, and all hope of recovering it\nhave been forever lost.\n\nBut fleet-footed Joe put forth his utmost speed, and checked the car,\nwhile the balloon beat upon the sand, at the risk of being torn\nto pieces. The doctor, followed by Kennedy, leaped in, and lit his\ncylinder, while his companions threw out the superfluous ballast.\n\nThe travellers took one last look at the trees of the oasis bowing to\nthe force of the hurricane, and soon, catching the wind at two hundred\nfeet above the ground, disappeared in the gloom.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-NINTH.\n\nSigns of Vegetation.--The Fantastic Notion of a French Author.--A\nMagnificent Country.--The Kingdom of Adamova.--The Explorations of\nSpeke and Burton connected with those of Dr. Barth.--The Atlantika\nMountains.--The River Benoue.--The City of Yola.--The Bagele.--Mount\nMendif.\n\nFrom the moment of their departure, the travellers moved with great\nvelocity. They longed to leave behind them the desert, which had so\nnearly been fatal to them.\n\nAbout a quarter-past nine in the morning, they caught a glimpse of\nsome signs of vegetation: herbage floating on that sea of sand, and\nannouncing, as the weeds upon the ocean did to Christopher Columbus, the\nnearness of the shore--green shoots peeping up timidly between pebbles\nthat were, in their turn, to be the rocks of that vast expanse.\n\nHills, but of trifling height, were seen in wavy lines upon the horizon.\nTheir profile, muffled by the heavy mist, was defined but vaguely. The\nmonotony, however, was beginning to disappear.\n\nThe doctor hailed with joy the new country thus disclosed, and, like a\nseaman on lookout at the mast-head, he was ready to shout aloud:\n\n\"Land, ho! land!\"\n\nAn hour later the continent spread broadly before their gaze, still wild\nin aspect, but less flat, less denuded, and with a few trees standing\nout against the gray sky.\n\n\"We are in a civilized country at last!\" said the hunter.\n\n\"Civilized? Well, that's one way of speaking; but there are no people to\nbe seen yet.\"\n\n\"It will not be long before we see them,\" said Ferguson, \"at our present\nrate of travel.\"\n\n\"Are we still in the negro country, doctor?\"\n\n\"Yes, and on our way to the country of the Arabs.\"\n\n\"What! real Arabs, sir, with their camels?\"\n\n\"No, not many camels; they are scarce, if not altogether unknown, in\nthese regions. We must go a few degrees farther north to see them.\"\n\n\"What a pity!\"\n\n\"And why, Joe?\"\n\n\"Because, if the wind fell contrary, they might be of use to us.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, it's just a notion that's got into my head: we might hitch\nthem to the car, and make them tow us along. What do you say to that,\ndoctor?\"\n\n\"Poor Joe! Another person had that idea in advance of you. It was used\nby a very gifted French author--M. Mery--in a romance, it is true. He\nhas his travellers drawn along in a balloon by a team of camels; then a\nlion comes up, devours the camels, swallows the tow-rope, and hauls the\nballoon in their stead; and so on through the story. You see that the\nwhole thing is the top-flower of fancy, but has nothing in common with\nour style of locomotion.\"\n\nJoe, a little cut down at learning that his idea had been used already,\ncudgelled his wits to imagine what animal could have devoured the\nlion; but he could not guess it, and so quietly went on scanning the\nappearance of the country.\n\nA lake of medium extent stretched away before him, surrounded by an\namphitheatre of hills, which yet could not be dignified with the name of\nmountains. There were winding valleys, numerous and fertile, with their\ntangled thickets of the most various trees. The African oil-tree rose\nabove the mass, with leaves fifteen feet in length upon its stalk,\nthe latter studded with sharp thorns; the bombax, or silk-cotton-tree,\nfilled the wind, as it swept by, with the fine down of its seeds; the\npungent odors of the pendanus, the \"kenda\" of the Arabs, perfumed the\nair up to the height where the Victoria was sailing; the papaw-tree,\nwith its palm-shaped leaves; the sterculier, which produces the\nSoudan-nut; the baobab, and the banana-tree, completed the luxuriant\nflora of these inter-tropical regions.\n\n\"The country is superb!\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Here are some animals,\" added Joe. \"Men are not far away.\"\n\n\"Oh, what magnificent elephants!\" exclaimed Kennedy. \"Is there no way to\nget a little shooting?\"\n\n\"How could we manage to halt in a current as strong as this? No, Dick;\nyou must taste a little of the torture of Tantalus just now. You shall\nmake up for it afterward.\"\n\nAnd, in truth, there was enough to excite the fancy of a sportsman.\nDick's heart fairly leaped in his breast as he grasped the butt of his\nPurdy.\n\nThe fauna of the region were as striking as its flora. The wild-ox\nrevelled in dense herbage that often concealed his whole body; gray,\nblack, and yellow elephants of the most gigantic size burst headlong,\nlike a living hurricane, through the forests, breaking, rending, tearing\ndown, devastating every thing in their path; upon the woody slopes of\nthe hills trickled cascades and springs flowing northward; there, too,\nthe hippopotami bathed their huge forms, splashing and snorting as they\nfrolicked in the water, and lamantines, twelve feet long, with bodies\nlike seals, stretched themselves along the banks, turning up toward the\nsun their rounded teats swollen with milk.\n\nIt was a whole menagerie of rare and curious beasts in a wondrous\nhot-house, where numberless birds with plumage of a thousand hues\ngleamed and fluttered in the sunshine.\n\nBy this prodigality of Nature, the doctor recognized the splendid\nkingdom of Adamova.\n\n\"We are now beginning to trench upon the realm of modern discovery.\nI have taken up the lost scent of preceding travellers. It is a happy\nchance, my friends, for we shall be enabled to link the toils of\nCaptains Burton and Speke with the explorations of Dr. Barth. We\nhave left the Englishmen behind us, and now have caught up with the\nHamburger. It will not be long, either, before we arrive at the extreme\npoint attained by that daring explorer.\"\n\n\"It seems to me that there is a vast extent of country between the two\nexplored routes,\" remarked Kennedy; \"at least, if I am to judge by the\ndistance that we have made.\"\n\n\"It is easy to determine: take the map and see what is the longitude of\nthe southern point of Lake Ukereoue, reached by Speke.\"\n\n\"It is near the thirty-seventh degree.\"\n\n\"And the city of Yola, which we shall sight this evening, and to which\nBarth penetrated, what is its position?\"\n\n\"It is about in the twelfth degree of east longitude.\"\n\n\"Then there are twenty-five degrees, or, counting sixty miles to each,\nabout fifteen hundred miles in all.\"\n\n\"A nice little walk,\" said Joe, \"for people who have to go on foot.\"\n\n\"It will be accomplished, however. Livingstone and Moffat are pushing on\nup this line toward the interior. Nyassa, which they have discovered,\nis not far from Lake Tanganayika, seen by Burton. Ere the close of the\ncentury these regions will, undoubtedly, be explored. But,\" added the\ndoctor, consulting his compass, \"I regret that the wind is carrying us\nso far to the westward. I wanted to get to the north.\"\n\nAfter twelve hours of progress, the Victoria found herself on the\nconfines of Nigritia. The first inhabitants of this region, the Chouas\nArabs, were feeding their wandering flocks. The immense summits of the\nAtlantika Mountains seen above the horizon--mountains that no European\nfoot had yet scaled, and whose height is computed to be ten thousand\nfeet! Their western slope determines the flow of all the waters in this\nregion of Africa toward the ocean. They are the Mountains of the Moon to\nthis part of the continent.\n\nAt length a real river greeted the gaze of our travellers, and, by\nthe enormous ant-hills seen in its vicinity, the doctor recognized the\nBenoue, one of the great tributaries of the Niger, the one which the\nnatives have called \"The Fountain of the Waters.\"\n\n\"This river,\" said the doctor to his companions, \"will, one day, be the\nnatural channel of communication with the interior of Nigritia. Under\nthe command of one of our brave captains, the steamer Pleiad has already\nascended as far as the town of Yola. You see that we are not in an\nunknown country.\"\n\nNumerous slaves were engaged in the labors of the field, cultivating\nsorgho, a kind of millet which forms the chief basis of their diet; and\nthe most stupid expressions of astonishment ensued as the Victoria sped\npast like a meteor. That evening the balloon halted about forty miles\nfrom Yola, and ahead of it, but in the distance, rose the two sharp\ncones of Mount Mendif.\n\nThe doctor threw out his anchors and made fast to the top of a high\ntree; but a very violent wind beat upon the balloon with such force as\nto throw it over on its side, thus rendering the position of the car\nsometimes extremely dangerous. Ferguson did not close his all night, and\nhe was repeatedly on the point of cutting the anchor-rope and scudding\naway before the gale. At length, however, the storm abated, and the\noscillations of the balloon ceased to be alarming.\n\nOn the morrow the wind was more moderate, but it carried our travellers\naway from the city of Yola, which recently rebuilt by the Fouillans,\nexcited Ferguson's curiosity. However, he had to make up his mind to\nbeing borne farther to the northward and even a little to the east.\n\nKennedy proposed to halt in this fine hunting-country, and Joe declared\nthat the need of fresh meat was beginning to be felt; but the savage\ncustoms of the country, the attitude of the population, and some shots\nfired at the Victoria, admonished the doctor to continue his journey.\nThey were then crossing a region that was the scene of massacres and\nburnings, and where warlike conflicts between the barbarian sultans,\ncontending for their power amid the most atrocious carnage, never cease.\n\nNumerous and populous villages of long low huts stretched away\nbetween broad pasture-fields whose dense herbage was besprinkled with\nviolet-colored blossoms. The huts, looking like huge beehives, were\nsheltered behind bristling palisades. The wild hill-sides and hollows\nfrequently reminded the beholder of the glens in the Highlands of\nScotland, as Kennedy more than once remarked.\n\nIn spite of all he could do, the doctor bore directly to the northeast,\ntoward Mount Mendif, which was lost in the midst of environing clouds.\nThe lofty summits of these mountains separate the valley of the Niger\nfrom the basin of Lake Tchad.\n\nSoon afterward was seen the Bagele, with its eighteen villages clinging\nto its flanks like a whole brood of children to their mother's bosom--a\nmagnificent spectacle for the beholder whose gaze commanded and took in\nthe entire picture at one view. Even the ravines were seen to be covered\nwith fields of rice and of arachides.\n\nBy three o'clock the Victoria was directly in front of Mount Mendif. It\nhad been impossible to avoid it; the only thing to be done was to cross\nit. The doctor, by means of a temperature increased to one hundred and\neighty degrees, gave the balloon a fresh ascensional force of nearly\nsixteen hundred pounds, and it went up to an elevation of more than\neight thousand feet, the greatest height attained during the journey.\nThe temperature of the atmosphere was so much cooler at that point that\nthe aeronauts had to resort to their blankets and thick coverings.\n\nFerguson was in haste to descend; the covering of the balloon gave\nindications of bursting, but in the meanwhile he had time to satisfy\nhimself of the volcanic origin of the mountain, whose extinct craters\nare now but deep abysses. Immense accumulations of bird-guano gave the\nsides of Mount Mendif the appearance of calcareous rocks, and there\nwas enough of the deposit there to manure all the lands in the United\nKingdom.\n\nAt five o'clock the Victoria, sheltered from the south winds, went\ngently gliding along the slopes of the mountain, and stopped in a wide\nclearing remote from any habitation. The instant it touched the soil,\nall needful precautions were taken to hold it there firmly; and Kennedy,\nfowling-piece in hand, sallied out upon the sloping plain. Ere long,\nhe returned with half a dozen wild ducks and a kind of snipe, which Joe\nserved up in his best style. The meal was heartily relished, and the\nnight was passed in undisturbed and refreshing slumber.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTIETH.\n\nMosfeia.--The Sheik.--Denham, Clapperton, and Oudney.--Vogel.--The\nCapital of Loggoum.--Toole.--Becalmed above Kernak.--The Governor and\nhis Court.--The Attack.--The Incendiary Pigeons.\n\nOn the next day, May 11th, the Victoria resumed her adventurous journey.\nHer passengers had the same confidence in her that a good seaman has in\nhis ship.\n\nIn terrific hurricanes, in tropical heats, when making dangerous\ndepartures, and descents still more dangerous, it had, at all times\nand in all places, come out safely. It might almost have been said that\nFerguson managed it with a wave of the hand; and hence, without knowing\nin advance, where the point of arrival would be, the doctor had no fears\nconcerning the successful issue of his journey. However, in this country\nof barbarians and fanatics, prudence obliged him to take the strictest\nprecautions. He therefore counselled his companions to have their eyes\nwide open for every thing and at all hours.\n\nThe wind drifted a little more to the northward, and, toward nine\no'clock, they sighted the larger city of Mosfeia, built upon an eminence\nwhich was itself enclosed between two lofty mountains. Its position\nwas impregnable, a narrow road running between a marsh and a thick wood\nbeing the only channel of approach to it.\n\nAt the moment of which we write, a sheik, accompanied by a mounted\nescort, and clad in a garb of brilliant colors, preceded by couriers\nand trumpeters, who put aside the boughs of the trees as he rode up, was\nmaking his grand entry into the place.\n\nThe doctor lowered the balloon in order to get a better look at this\ncavalcade of natives; but, as the balloon grew larger to their eyes,\nthey began to show symptoms of intense affright, and at length made off\nin different directions as fast as their legs and those of their horses\ncould carry them.\n\nThe sheik alone did not budge an inch. He merely grasped his long\nmusket, cocked it, and proudly waited in silence. The doctor came on to\nwithin a hundred and fifty feet of him, and then, with his roundest and\nfullest voice, saluted him courteously in the Arabic tongue.\n\nBut, upon hearing these words falling, as it seemed, from the sky, the\nsheik dismounted and prostrated himself in the dust of the highway,\nwhere the doctor had to leave him, finding it impossible to divert him\nfrom his adoration.\n\n\"Unquestionably,\" Ferguson remarked, \"those people take us for\nsupernatural beings. When Europeans came among them for the first time,\nthey were mistaken for creatures of a higher race. When this sheik\ncomes to speak of to-day's meeting, he will not fail to embellish the\ncircumstance with all the resources of an Arab imagination. You may,\ntherefore, judge what an account their legends will give of us some\nday.\"\n\n\"Not such a desirable thing, after all,\" said the Scot, \"in the point of\nview that affects civilization; it would be better to pass for mere men.\nThat would give these negro races a superior idea of European power.\"\n\n\"Very good, my dear Dick; but what can we do about it? You might sit\nall day explaining the mechanism of a balloon to the savants of this\ncountry, and yet they would not comprehend you, but would persist in\nascribing it to supernatural aid.\"\n\n\"Doctor, you spoke of the first time Europeans visited these regions.\nWho were the visitors?\" inquired Joe.\n\n\"My dear fellow, we are now upon the very track of Major Denham. It\nwas at this very city of Mosfeia that he was received by the Sultan of\nMandara; he had quitted the Bornou country; he accompanied the sheik in\nan expedition against the Fellatahs; he assisted in the attack on the\ncity, which, with its arrows alone, bravely resisted the bullets of the\nArabs, and put the sheik's troops to flight. All this was but a pretext\nfor murders, raids, and pillage. The major was completely plundered\nand stripped, and had it not been for his horse, under whose stomach he\nclung with the skill of an Indian rider, and was borne with a headlong\ngallop from his barbarous pursuers, he never could have made his way\nback to Kouka, the capital of Bornou.\"\n\n\"Who was this Major Denham?\"\n\n\"A fearless Englishman, who, between 1822 and 1824, commanded an\nexpedition into the Bornou country, in company with Captain Clapperton\nand Dr. Oudney. They set out from Tripoli in the month of March, reached\nMourzouk, the capital of Fez, and, following the route which at a later\nperiod Dr. Barth was to pursue on his way back to Europe, they arrived,\non the 16th of February, 1823, at Kouka, near Lake Tchad. Denham made\nseveral explorations in Bornou, in Mandara, and to the eastern shores\nof the lake. In the mean time, on the 15th of December, 1823, Captain\nClapperton and Dr. Oudney had pushed their way through the Soudan\ncountry as far as Sackatoo, and Oudney died of fatigue and exhaustion in\nthe town of Murmur.\"\n\n\"This part of Africa has, therefore, paid a heavy tribute of victims to\nthe cause of science,\" said Kennedy.\n\n\"Yes, this country is fatal to travellers. We are moving directly toward\nthe kingdom of Baghirmi, which Vogel traversed in 1856, so as to reach\nthe Wadai country, where he disappeared. This young man, at the age of\ntwenty-three, had been sent to cooperate with Dr. Barth. They met on the\n1st of December, 1854, and thereupon commenced his explorations of the\ncountry. Toward 1856, he announced, in the last letters received\nfrom him, his intention to reconnoitre the kingdom of Wadai, which no\nEuropean had yet penetrated. It appears that he got as far as Wara, the\ncapital, where, according to some accounts, he was made prisoner, and,\naccording to others, was put to death for having attempted to ascend a\nsacred mountain in the environs. But, we must not too lightly admit the\ndeath of travellers, since that does away with the necessity of going\nin search of them. For instance, how often was the death of Dr. Barth\nreported, to his own great annoyance! It is, therefore, very possible\nthat Vogel may still be held as a prisoner by the Sultan of Wadai, in\nthe hope of obtaining a good ransom for him.\n\n\"Baron de Neimans was about starting for the Wadai country when he\ndied at Cairo, in 1855; and we now know that De Heuglin has set out on\nVogel's track with the expedition sent from Leipsic, so that we shall\nsoon be accurately informed as to the fate of that young and interesting\nexplorer.\"*\n\n     * Since the doctor's departure, letters written from\n     El'Obeid by Mr. Muntzinger, the newly-appointed head of the\n     expedition, unfortunately place the death of Vogel beyond a\n     doubt.\n\nMosfeia had disappeared from the horizon long ere this, and the Mandara\ncountry was developing to the gaze of our aeronauts its astonishing\nfertility, with its forests of acacias, its locust-trees covered with\nred flowers, and the herbaceous plants of its fields of cotton and\nindigo trees. The river Shari, which eighty miles farther on rolled its\nimpetuous waters into Lake Tchad, was quite distinctly seen.\n\nThe doctor got his companions to trace its course upon the maps drawn by\nDr. Barth.\n\n\"You perceive,\" said he, \"that the labors of this savant have been\nconducted with great precision; we are moving directly toward the\nLoggoum region, and perhaps toward Kernak, its capital. It was there\nthat poor Toole died, at the age of scarcely twenty-two. He was a young\nEnglishman, an ensign in the 80th regiment, who, a few weeks before, had\njoined Major Denham in Africa, and it was not long ere he there met\nhis death. Ah! this vast country might well be called the graveyard of\nEuropean travellers.\"\n\nSome boats, fifty feet long, were descending the current of the Shari.\nThe Victoria, then one thousand feet above the soil, hardly attracted\nthe attention of the natives; but the wind, which until then had been\nblowing with a certain degree of strength, was falling off.\n\n\"Is it possible that we are to be caught in another dead calm?\" sighed\nthe doctor.\n\n\"Well, we've no lack of water, nor the desert to fear, anyhow, master,\"\nsaid Joe.\n\n\"No; but there are races here still more to be dreaded.\"\n\n\"Why!\" said Joe, again, \"there's something like a town.\"\n\n\"That is Kernak. The last puffs of the breeze are wafting us to it, and,\nif we choose, we can take an exact plan of the place.\"\n\n\"Shall we not go nearer to it?\" asked Kennedy.\n\n\"Nothing easier, Dick! We are right over it. Allow me to turn the\nstopcock of the cylinder, and we'll not be long in descending.\"\n\nHalf an hour later the balloon hung motionless about two hundred feet\nfrom the ground.\n\n\"Here we are!\" said the doctor, \"nearer to Kernak than a man would be to\nLondon, if he were perched in the cupola of St. Paul's. So we can take a\nsurvey at our ease.\"\n\n\"What is that tick-tacking sound that we hear on all sides?\"\n\nJoe looked attentively, and at length discovered that the noise they\nheard was produced by a number of weavers beating cloth stretched in the\nopen air, on large trunks of trees.\n\nThe capital of Loggoum could then be seen in its entire extent, like\nan unrolled chart. It is really a city with straight rows of houses\nand quite wide streets. In the midst of a large open space there was a\nslave-market, attended by a great crowd of customers, for the Mandara\nwomen, who have extremely small hands and feet, are in excellent\nrequest, and can be sold at lucrative rates.\n\nAt the sight of the Victoria, the scene so often produced occurred\nagain. At first there were outcries, and then followed general\nstupefaction; business was abandoned; work was flung aside, and\nall noise ceased. The aeronauts remained as they were, completely\nmotionless, and lost not a detail of the populous city. They even went\ndown to within sixty feet of the ground.\n\nHereupon the Governor of Loggoum came out from his residence, displaying\nhis green standard, and accompanied by his musicians, who blew on hoarse\nbuffalo-horns, as though they would split their cheeks or any thing\nelse, excepting their own lungs. The crowd at once gathered around him.\nIn the mean while Dr. Ferguson tried to make himself heard, but in vain.\n\nThis population looked like proud and intelligent people, with their\nhigh foreheads, their almost aquiline noses, and their curling hair; but\nthe presence of the Victoria troubled them greatly. Horsemen could be\nseen galloping in all directions, and it soon became evident that the\ngovernor's troops were assembling to oppose so extraordinary a foe. Joe\nwore himself out waving handkerchiefs of every color and shape to them;\nbut his exertions were all to no purpose.\n\nHowever, the sheik, surrounded by his court, proclaimed silence, and\npronounced a discourse, of which the doctor could not understand a word.\nIt was Arabic, mixed with Baghirmi. He could make out enough, however,\nby the universal language of gestures, to be aware that he was receiving\na very polite invitation to depart. Indeed, he would have asked for\nnothing better, but for lack of wind, the thing had become impossible.\nHis noncompliance, therefore, exasperated the governor, whose courtiers\nand attendants set up a furious howl to enforce immediate obedience on\nthe part of the aerial monster.\n\nThey were odd-looking fellows those courtiers, with their five or six\nshirts swathed around their bodies! They had enormous stomachs, some\nof which actually seemed to be artificial. The doctor surprised his\ncompanions by informing them that this was the way to pay court to\nthe sultan. The rotundity of the stomach indicated the ambition of its\npossessor. These corpulent gentry gesticulated and bawled at the top of\ntheir voices--one of them particularly distinguishing himself above\nthe rest--to such an extent, indeed, that he must have been a prime\nminister--at least, if the disturbance he made was any criterion of his\nrank. The common rabble of dusky denizens united their howlings with\nthe uproar of the court, repeating their gesticulations like so many\nmonkeys, and thereby producing a single and instantaneous movement of\nten thousand arms at one time.\n\nTo these means of intimidation, which were presently deemed\ninsufficient, were added others still more formidable. Soldiers, armed\nwith bows and arrows, were drawn up in line of battle; but by this time\nthe balloon was expanding, and rising quietly beyond their reach. Upon\nthis the governor seized a musket and aimed it at the balloon; but,\nKennedy, who was watching him, shattered the uplifted weapon in the\nsheik's grasp.\n\nAt this unexpected blow there was a general rout. Every mother's son\nof them scampered for his dwelling with the utmost celerity, and stayed\nthere, so that the streets of the town were absolutely deserted for the\nremainder of that day.\n\nNight came, and not a breath of wind was stirring. The aeronauts had to\nmake up their minds to remain motionless at the distance of but three\nhundred feet above the ground. Not a fire or light shone in the deep\ngloom, and around reigned the silence of death; but the doctor only\nredoubled his vigilance, as this apparent quiet might conceal some\nsnare.\n\nAnd he had reason to be watchful. About midnight, the whole city seemed\nto be in a blaze. Hundreds of streaks of flame crossed each other, and\nshot to and fro in the air like rockets, forming a regular network of\nfire.\n\n\"That's really curious!\" said the doctor, somewhat puzzled to make out\nwhat it meant.\n\n\"By all that's glorious!\" shouted Kennedy, \"it looks as if the fire were\nascending and coming up toward us!\"\n\nAnd, sure enough, with an accompaniment of musket-shots, yelling, and\ndin of every description, the mass of fire was, indeed, mounting toward\nthe Victoria. Joe got ready to throw out ballast, and Ferguson was not\nlong at guessing the truth. Thousands of pigeons, their tails garnished\nwith combustibles, had been set loose and driven toward the Victoria;\nand now, in their terror, they were flying high up, zigzagging the\natmosphere with lines of fire. Kennedy was preparing to discharge all\nhis batteries into the middle of the ascending multitude, but what could\nhe have done against such a numberless army? The pigeons were already\nwhisking around the car; they were even surrounding the balloon,\nthe sides of which, reflecting their illumination, looked as though\nenveloped with a network of fire.\n\nThe doctor dared hesitate no longer; and, throwing out a fragment of\nquartz, he kept himself beyond the reach of these dangerous assailants;\nand, for two hours afterward, he could see them wandering hither and\nthither through the darkness of the night, until, little by little,\ntheir light diminished, and they, one by one, died out.\n\n\"Now we may sleep in quiet,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Not badly got up for barbarians,\" mused friend Joe, speaking his\nthoughts aloud.\n\n\"Oh, they employ these pigeons frequently, to set fire to the thatch\nof hostile villages; but this time the village mounted higher than they\ncould go.\"\n\n\"Why, positively, a balloon need fear no enemies!\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, it may!\" objected Ferguson.\n\n\"What are they, then, doctor?\"\n\n\"They are the careless people in the car! So, my friends, let us have\nvigilance in all places and at all times.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-FIRST.\n\nDeparture in the Night-time.--All Three.--Kennedy's\nInstincts.--Precautions.--The Course of the Shari River.--Lake\nTchad.--The Water of the Lake.--The Hippopotamus.--One Bullet thrown\naway.\n\nAbout three o'clock in the morning, Joe, who was then on watch, at\nlength saw the city move away from beneath his feet. The Victoria was\nonce again in motion, and both the doctor and Kennedy awoke.\n\nThe former consulted his compass, and saw, with satisfaction, that the\nwind was carrying them toward the north-northeast.\n\n\"We are in luck!\" said he; \"every thing works in our favor: we shall\ndiscover Lake Tchad this very day.\"\n\n\"Is it a broad sheet of water?\" asked Kennedy.\n\n\"Somewhat, Dick. At its greatest length and breadth, it measures about\none hundred and twenty miles.\"\n\n\"It will spice our trip with a little variety to sail over a spacious\nsheet of water.\"\n\n\"After all, though, I don't see that we have much to complain of on that\nscore. Our trip has been very much varied, indeed; and, moreover, we are\ngetting on under the best possible conditions.\"\n\n\"Unquestionably so; excepting those privations on the desert, we have\nencountered no serious danger.\"\n\n\"It is not to be denied that our noble balloon has behaved wonderfully\nwell. To-day is May 12th, and we started on the 18th of April. That\nmakes twenty-five days of journeying. In ten days more we shall have\nreached our destination.\"\n\n\"Where is that?\"\n\n\"I do not know. But what does that signify?\"\n\n\"You are right again, Samuel! Let us intrust to Providence the care of\nguiding us and of keeping us in good health as we are now. We don't look\nmuch as though we had been crossing the most pestilential country in the\nworld!\"\n\n\"We had an opportunity of getting up in life, and that's what we have\ndone!\"\n\n\"Hurrah for trips in the air!\" cried Joe. \"Here we are at the end of\ntwenty-five days in good condition, well fed, and well rested. We've had\ntoo much rest in fact, for my legs begin to feel rusty, and I wouldn't\nbe vexed a bit to stretch them with a run of thirty miles or so!\"\n\n\"You can do that, Joe, in the streets of London, but in fine we set\nout three together, like Denham, Clapperton, and Overweg; like Barth,\nRichardson, and Vogel, and, more fortunate than our predecessors here,\nwe are three in number still. But it is most important for us not to\nseparate. If, while one of us was on the ground, the Victoria should\nhave to ascend in order to escape some sudden danger, who knows whether\nwe should ever see each other again? Therefore it is that I say again to\nKennedy frankly that I do not like his going off alone to hunt.\"\n\n\"But still, Samuel, you will permit me to indulge that fancy a little.\nThere is no harm in renewing our stock of provisions. Besides, before\nour departure, you held out to me the prospect of some superb hunting,\nand thus far I have done but little in the line of the Andersons and\nCummings.\"\n\n\"But, my dear Dick, your memory fails you, or your modesty makes you\nforget your own exploits. It really seems to me that, without mentioning\nsmall game, you have already an antelope, an elephant, and two lions on\nyour conscience.\"\n\n\"But what's all that to an African sportsman who sees all the animals\nin creation strutting along under the muzzle of his rifle? There! there!\nlook at that troop of giraffes!\"\n\n\"Those giraffes,\" roared Joe; \"why, they're not as big as my fist.\"\n\n\"Because we are a thousand feet above them; but close to them you would\ndiscover that they are three times as tall as you are!\"\n\n\"And what do you say to yon herd of gazelles, and those ostriches, that\nrun with the speed of the wind?\" resumed Kennedy.\n\n\"Those ostriches?\" remonstrated Joe, again; \"those are chickens, and the\ngreatest kind of chickens!\"\n\n\"Come, doctor, can't we get down nearer to them?\" pleaded Kennedy.\n\n\"We can get closer to them, Dick, but we must not land. And what good\nwill it do you to strike down those poor animals when they can be of no\nuse to you? Now, if the question were to destroy a lion, a tiger, a cat,\na hyena, I could understand it; but to deprive an antelope or a gazelle\nof life, to no other purpose than the gratification of your instincts as\na sportsman, seems hardly worth the trouble. But, after all, my friend,\nwe are going to keep at about one hundred feet only from the soil, and,\nshould you see any ferocious wild beast, oblige us by sending a ball\nthrough its heart!\"\n\nThe Victoria descended gradually, but still keeping at a safe height,\nfor, in a barbarous, yet very populous country, it was necessary to keep\non the watch for unexpected perils.\n\nThe travellers were then directly following the course of the Shari. The\ncharming banks of this river were hidden beneath the foliage of trees of\nvarious dyes; lianas and climbing plants wound in and out on all sides\nand formed the most curious combinations of color. Crocodiles were seen\nbasking in the broad blaze of the sun or plunging beneath the waters\nwith the agility of lizards, and in their gambols they sported about\namong the many green islands that intercept the current of the stream.\n\nIt was thus, in the midst of rich and verdant landscapes that our\ntravellers passed over the district of Maffatay, and about nine o'clock\nin the morning reached the southern shore of Lake Tchad.\n\nThere it was at last, outstretched before them, that Caspian Sea of\nAfrica, the existence of which was so long consigned to the realms of\nfable--that interior expanse of water to which only Denham's and Barth's\nexpeditions had been able to force their way.\n\nThe doctor strove in vain to fix its precise configuration upon paper.\nIt had already changed greatly since 1847. In fact, the chart of Lake\nTchad is very difficult to trace with exactitude, for it is surrounded\nby muddy and almost impassable morasses, in which Barth thought that\nhe was doomed to perish. From year to year these marshes, covered with\nreeds and papyrus fifteen feet high, become the lake itself. Frequently,\ntoo, the villages on its shores are half submerged, as was the case with\nNgornou in 1856, and now the hippopotamus and the alligator frisk and\ndive where the dwellings of Bornou once stood.\n\nThe sun shot his dazzling rays over this placid sheet of water, and\ntoward the north the two elements merged into one and the same horizon.\n\nThe doctor was desirous of determining the character of the water, which\nwas long believed to be salt. There was no danger in descending close to\nthe lake, and the car was soon skimming its surface like a bird at the\ndistance of only five feet.\n\nJoe plunged a bottle into the lake and drew it up half filled. The water\nwas then tasted and found to be but little fit for drinking, with a\ncertain carbonate-of-soda flavor.\n\nWhile the doctor was jotting down the result of this experiment, the\nloud report of a gun was heard close beside him. Kennedy had not been\nable to resist the temptation of firing at a huge hippopotamus. The\nlatter, who had been basking quietly, disappeared at the sound of the\nexplosion, but did not seem to be otherwise incommoded by Kennedy's\nconical bullet.\n\n\"You'd have done better if you had harpooned him,\" said Joe.\n\n\"But how?\"\n\n\"With one of our anchors. It would have been a hook just big enough for\nsuch a rousing beast as that!\"\n\n\"Humph!\" ejaculated Kennedy, \"Joe really has an idea this time--\"\n\n\"Which I beg of you not to put into execution,\" interposed the doctor.\n\"The animal would very quickly have dragged us where we could not have\ndone much to help ourselves, and where we have no business to be.\"\n\n\"Especially now since we've settled the question as to what kind of\nwater there is in Lake Tchad. Is that sort of fish good to eat, Dr.\nFerguson?\"\n\n\"That fish, as you call it, Joe, is really a mammiferous animal of the\npachydermal species. Its flesh is said to be excellent and is an article\nof important trade between the tribes living along the borders of the\nlake.\"\n\n\"Then I'm sorry that Mr. Kennedy's shot didn't do more damage.\"\n\n\"The animal is vulnerable only in the stomach and between the thighs.\nDick's ball hasn't even marked him; but should the ground strike me as\nfavorable, we shall halt at the northern end of the lake, where Kennedy\nwill find himself in the midst of a whole menagerie, and can make up for\nlost time.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Joe, \"I hope then that Mr. Kennedy will hunt the\nhippopotamus a little; I'd like to taste the meat of that queer-looking\nbeast. It doesn't look exactly natural to get away into the centre of\nAfrica, to feed on snipe and partridge, just as if we were in England.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SECOND.\n\nThe Capital of Bornou.--The Islands of the Biddiomahs.--The\nCondors.--The Doctor's Anxieties.--His Precautions.--An Attack\nin Mid-air.--The Balloon Covering torn.--The Fall.--Sublime\nSelf-Sacrifice.--The Northern Coast of the Lake.\n\nSince its arrival at Lake Tchad, the balloon had struck a current that\nedged it farther to the westward. A few clouds tempered the heat of the\nday, and, besides, a little air could be felt over this vast expanse of\nwater; but about one o'clock, the Victoria, having slanted across this\npart of the lake, again advanced over the land for a space of seven or\neight miles.\n\nThe doctor, who was somewhat vexed at first at this turn of his course,\nno longer thought of complaining when he caught sight of the city of\nKouka, the capital of Bornou. He saw it for a moment, encircled by\nits walls of white clay, and a few rudely-constructed mosques\nrising clumsily above that conglomeration of houses that look like\nplaying-dice, which form most Arab towns. In the court-yards of\nthe private dwellings, and on the public squares, grew palms and\ncaoutchouc-trees topped with a dome of foliage more than one hundred\nfeet in breadth. Joe called attention to the fact that these immense\nparasols were in proper accordance with the intense heat of the sun, and\nmade thereon some pious reflections which it were needless to repeat.\n\nKouka really consists of two distinct towns, separated by the \"Dendal,\"\na large boulevard three hundred yards wide, at that hour crowded with\nhorsemen and foot passengers. On one side, the rich quarter stands\nsquarely with its airy and lofty houses, laid out in regular order; on\nthe other, is huddled together the poor quarter, a miserable collection\nof low hovels of a conical shape, in which a poverty-stricken multitude\nvegetate rather than live, since Kouka is neither a trading nor a\ncommercial city.\n\nKennedy thought it looked something like Edinburgh, were that city\nextended on a plain, with its two distinct boroughs.\n\nBut our travellers had scarcely the time to catch even this glimpse of\nit, for, with the fickleness that characterizes the air-currents of this\nregion, a contrary wind suddenly swept them some forty miles over the\nsurface of Lake Tchad.\n\nThen then were regaled with a new spectacle. They could count the\nnumerous islets of the lake, inhabited by the Biddiomahs, a race of\nbloodthirsty and formidable pirates, who are as greatly feared when\nneighbors as are the Touaregs of Sahara.\n\nThese estimable people were in readiness to receive the Victoria bravely\nwith stones and arrows, but the balloon quickly passed their islands,\nfluttering over them, from one to the other with butterfly motion, like\na gigantic beetle.\n\nAt this moment, Joe, who was scanning the horizon, said to Kennedy:\n\n\"There, sir, as you are always thinking of good sport, yonder is just\nthe thing for you!\"\n\n\"What is it, Joe?\"\n\n\"This time, the doctor will not disapprove of your shooting.\"\n\n\"But what is it?\"\n\n\"Don't you see that flock of big birds making for us?\"\n\n\"Birds?\" exclaimed the doctor, snatching his spyglass.\n\n\"I see them,\" replied Kennedy; \"there are at least a dozen of them.\"\n\n\"Fourteen, exactly!\" said Joe.\n\n\"Heaven grant that they may be of a kind sufficiently noxious for the\ndoctor to let me peg away at them!\"\n\n\"I should not object, but I would much rather see those birds at a\ndistance from us!\"\n\n\"Why, are you afraid of those fowls?\"\n\n\"They are condors, and of the largest size. Should they attack us--\"\n\n\"Well, if they do, we'll defend ourselves. We have a whole arsenal at\nour disposal. I don't think those birds are so very formidable.\"\n\n\"Who can tell?\" was the doctor's only remark.\n\nTen minutes later, the flock had come within gunshot, and were making\nthe air ring with their hoarse cries. They came right toward the\nVictoria, more irritated than frightened by her presence.\n\n\"How they scream! What a noise!\" said Joe.\n\n\"Perhaps they don't like to see anybody poaching in their country up in\nthe air, or daring to fly like themselves!\"\n\n\"Well, now, to tell the truth, when I take a good look at them, they are\nan ugly, ferocious set, and I should think them dangerous enough if they\nwere armed with Purdy-Moore rifles,\" admitted Kennedy.\n\n\"They have no need of such weapons,\" said Ferguson, looking very grave.\n\nThe condors flew around them in wide circles, their flight growing\ngradually closer and closer to the balloon. They swept through the\nair in rapid, fantastic curves, occasionally precipitating themselves\nheadlong with the speed of a bullet, and then breaking their line of\nprojection by an abrupt and daring angle.\n\nThe doctor, much disquieted, resolved to ascend so as to escape this\ndangerous proximity. He therefore dilated the hydrogen in his balloon,\nand it rapidly rose.\n\nBut the condors mounted with him, apparently determined not to part\ncompany.\n\n\"They seem to mean mischief!\" said the hunter, cocking his rifle.\n\nAnd, in fact, they were swooping nearer, and more than one came within\nfifty feet of them, as if defying the fire-arms.\n\n\"By George, I'm itching to let them have it!\" exclaimed Kennedy.\n\n\"No, Dick; not now! Don't exasperate them needlessly. That would only be\nexciting them to attack us!\"\n\n\"But I could soon settle those fellows!\"\n\n\"You may think so, Dick. But you are wrong!\"\n\n\"Why, we have a bullet for each of them!\"\n\n\"And suppose that they were to attack the upper part of the balloon,\nwhat would you do? How would you get at them? Just imagine yourself in\nthe presence of a troop of lions on the plain, or a school of sharks\nin the open ocean! For travellers in the air, this situation is just as\ndangerous.\"\n\n\"Are you speaking seriously, doctor?\"\n\n\"Very seriously, Dick.\"\n\n\"Let us wait, then!\"\n\n\"Wait! Hold yourself in readiness in case of an attack, but do not fire\nwithout my orders.\"\n\nThe birds then collected at a short distance, yet to near that their\nnaked necks, entirely bare of feathers, could be plainly seen, as they\nstretched them out with the effort of their cries, while their gristly\ncrests, garnished with a comb and gills of deep violet, stood erect with\nrage. They were of the very largest size, their bodies being more\nthan three feet in length, and the lower surface of their white wings\nglittering in the sunlight. They might well have been considered winged\nsharks, so striking was their resemblance to those ferocious rangers of\nthe deep.\n\n\"They are following us!\" said the doctor, as he saw them ascending with\nhim, \"and, mount as we may, they can fly still higher!\"\n\n\"Well, what are we to do?\" asked Kennedy.\n\nThe doctor made no answer.\n\n\"Listen, Samuel!\" said the sportsman. \"There are fourteen of those\nbirds; we have seventeen shots at our disposal if we discharge all our\nweapons. Have we not the means, then, to destroy them or disperse them?\nI will give a good account of some of them!\"\n\n\"I have no doubt of your skill, Dick; I look upon all as dead that may\ncome within range of your rifle, but I repeat that, if they attack the\nupper part of the balloon, you could not get a sight at them. They would\ntear the silk covering that sustains us, and we are three thousand feet\nup in the air!\"\n\nAt this moment, one of the ferocious birds darted right at the balloon,\nwith outstretched beak and claws, ready to rend it with either or both.\n\n\"Fire! fire at once!\" cried the doctor.\n\nHe had scarcely ceased, ere the huge creature, stricken dead, dropped\nheadlong, turning over and over in space as he fell.\n\nKennedy had already grasped one of the two-barrelled fowling-pieces and\nJoe was taking aim with another.\n\nFrightened by the report, the condors drew back for a moment, but they\nalmost instantly returned to the charge with extreme fury. Kennedy\nsevered the head of one from its body with his first shot, and Joe broke\nthe wing of another.\n\n\"Only eleven left,\" said he.\n\nThereupon the birds changed their tactics, and by common consent soared\nabove the balloon. Kennedy glanced at Ferguson. The latter, in spite\nof his imperturbability, grew pale. Then ensued a moment of terrifying\nsilence. In the next they heard a harsh tearing noise, as of something\nrending the silk, and the car seemed to sink from beneath the feet of\nour three aeronauts.\n\n\"We are lost!\" exclaimed Ferguson, glancing at the barometer, which was\nnow swiftly rising.\n\n\"Over with the ballast!\" he shouted, \"over with it!\"\n\nAnd in a few seconds the last lumps of quartz had disappeared.\n\n\"We are still falling! Empty the water-tanks! Do you hear me, Joe? We\nare pitching into the lake!\"\n\nJoe obeyed. The doctor leaned over and looked out. The lake seemed to\ncome up toward him like a rising tide. Every object around grew rapidly\nin size while they were looking at it. The car was not two hundred feet\nfrom the surface of Lake Tchad.\n\n\"The provisions! the provisions!\" cried the doctor.\n\nAnd the box containing them was launched into space.\n\nTheir descent became less rapid, but the luckless aeronauts were still\nfalling, and into the lake.\n\n\"Throw out something--something more!\" cried the doctor.\n\n\"There is nothing more to throw!\" was Kennedy's despairing response.\n\n\"Yes, there is!\" called Joe, and with a wave of the hand he disappeared\nlike a flash, over the edge of the car.\n\n\"Joe! Joe!\" exclaimed the doctor, horror-stricken.\n\nThe Victoria thus relieved resumed her ascending motion, mounted\na thousand feet into the air, and the wind, burying itself in the\ndisinflated covering, bore them away toward the northern part of the\nlake.\n\n\"Lost!\" exclaimed the sportsman, with a gesture of despair.\n\n\"Lost to save us!\" responded Ferguson.\n\nAnd these men, intrepid as they were, felt the large tears streaming\ndown their cheeks. They leaned over with the vain hope of seeing some\ntrace of their heroic companion, but they were already far away from\nhim.\n\n\"What course shall we pursue?\" asked Kennedy.\n\n\"Alight as soon as possible, Dick, and then wait.\"\n\nAfter a sweep of some sixty miles the Victoria halted on a desert shore,\non the north of the lake. The anchors caught in a low tree and the\nsportsman fastened it securely. Night came, but neither Ferguson nor\nKennedy could find one moment's sleep.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-THIRD.\n\nConjectures.--Reestablishment of the Victoria's Equilibrium.--Dr.\nFerguson's New Calculations.--Kennedy's Hunt.--A Complete Exploration of\nLake Tchad.--Tangalia.--The Return.--Lari.\n\nOn the morrow, the 13th of May, our travellers, for the first time,\nreconnoitred the part of the coast on which they had landed. It was a\nsort of island of solid ground in the midst of an immense marsh. Around\nthis fragment of terra firma grew reeds as lofty as trees are in Europe,\nand stretching away out of sight.\n\nThese impenetrable swamps gave security to the position of the balloon.\nIt was necessary to watch only the borders of the lake. The vast stretch\nof water broadened away from the spot, especially toward the east, and\nnothing could be seen on the horizon, neither mainland nor islands.\n\nThe two friends had not yet ventured to speak of their recent companion.\nKennedy first imparted his conjectures to the doctor.\n\n\"Perhaps Joe is not lost after all,\" he said. \"He was a skilful lad,\nand had few equals as a swimmer. He would find no difficulty in swimming\nacross the Firth of Forth at Edinburgh. We shall see him again--but how\nand where I know not. Let us omit nothing on our part to give him the\nchance of rejoining us.\"\n\n\"May God grant it as you say, Dick!\" replied the doctor, with much\nemotion. \"We shall do everything in the world to find our lost friend\nagain. Let us, in the first place, see where we are. But, above all\nthings, let us rid the Victoria of this outside covering, which is of\nno further use. That will relieve us of six hundred and fifty pounds, a\nweight not to be despised--and the end is worth the trouble!\"\n\nThe doctor and Kennedy went to work at once, but they encountered great\ndifficulty. They had to tear the strong silk away piece by piece, and\nthen cut it in narrow strips so as to extricate it from the meshes of\nthe network. The tear made by the beaks of the condors was found to be\nseveral feet in length.\n\nThis operation took at least four hours, but at length the inner balloon\nonce completely extricated did not appear to have suffered in the least\ndegree. The Victoria was thus diminished in size by one fifth, and this\ndifference was sufficiently noticeable to excite Kennedy's surprise.\n\n\"Will it be large enough?\" he asked.\n\n\"Have no fears on that score, I will reestablish the equilibrium, and\nshould our poor Joe return we shall find a way to start off with him\nagain on our old route.\"\n\n\"At the moment of our fall, unless I am mistaken, we were not far from\nan island.\"\n\n\"Yes, I recollect it,\" said the doctor, \"but that island, like all the\nislands on Lake Tchad, is, no doubt, inhabited by a gang of pirates and\nmurderers. They certainly witnessed our misfortune, and should Joe fall\ninto their hands, what will become of him unless protected by their\nsuperstitions?\"\n\n\"Oh, he's just the lad to get safely out of the scrape, I repeat. I have\ngreat confidence in his shrewdness and skill.\"\n\n\"I hope so. Now, Dick, you may go and hunt in the neighborhood, but\ndon't get far away whatever you do. It has become a pressing necessity\nfor us to renew our stock of provisions, since we had to sacrifice\nnearly all the old lot.\"\n\n\"Very good, doctor, I shall not be long absent.\"\n\nHereupon, Kennedy took a double-barrelled fowling-piece, and strode\nthrough the long grass toward a thicket not far off, where the frequent\nsound of shooting soon let the doctor know that the sportsman was making\na good use of his time.\n\nMeanwhile Ferguson was engaged in calculating the relative weight of the\narticles still left in the car, and in establishing the equipoise of the\nsecond balloon. He found that there were still left some thirty pounds\nof pemmican, a supply of tea and coffee, about a gallon and a half of\nbrandy, and one empty water-tank. All the dried meat had disappeared.\n\nThe doctor was aware that, by the loss of the hydrogen in the first\nballoon, the ascensional force at his disposal was now reduced to about\nnine hundred pounds. He therefore had to count upon this difference in\norder to rearrange his equilibrium. The new balloon measured sixty-seven\nthousand cubic feet, and contained thirty-three thousand four hundred\nand eighty feet of gas. The dilating apparatus appeared to be in good\ncondition, and neither the battery nor the spiral had been injured.\n\nThe ascensional force of the new balloon was then about three thousand\npounds, and, in adding together the weight of the apparatus, of the\npassengers, of the stock of water, of the car and its accessories, and\nputting aboard fifty gallons of water, and one hundred pounds of fresh\nmeat, the doctor got a total weight of twenty-eight hundred and thirty\npounds. He could then take with him one hundred and seventy pounds of\nballast, for unforeseen emergencies, and the balloon would be in exact\nbalance with the surrounding atmosphere.\n\nHis arrangements were completed accordingly, and he made up for Joe's\nweight with a surplus of ballast. He spent the whole day in these\npreparations, and the latter were finished when Kennedy returned. The\nhunter had been successful, and brought back a regular cargo of geese,\nwild-duck, snipe, teal, and plover. He went to work at once to draw and\nsmoke the game. Each piece, suspended on a small, thin skewer, was hung\nover a fire of green wood. When they seemed in good order, Kennedy, who\nwas perfectly at home in the business, packed them away in the car.\n\nOn the morrow, the hunter was to complete his supplies.\n\nEvening surprised our travellers in the midst of this work. Their supper\nconsisted of pemmican, biscuit, and tea; and fatigue, after having given\nthem appetite, brought them sleep. Each of them strained eyes and ears\ninto the gloom during his watch, sometimes fancying that they heard the\nvoice of poor Joe; but, alas! the voice that they so longed to hear, was\nfar away.\n\n\"At the first streak of day, the doctor aroused Kennedy.\n\n\"I have been long and carefully considering what should be done,\" said\nhe, \"to find our companion.\"\n\n\"Whatever your plan may be, doctor, it will suit me. Speak!\"\n\n\"Above all things, it is important that Joe should hear from us in some\nway.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly. Suppose the brave fellow should take it into his head that\nwe have abandoned him?\"\n\n\"He! He knows us too well for that. Such a thought would never come into\nhis mind. But he must be informed as to where we are.\"\n\n\"How can that be managed?\"\n\n\"We shall get into our car and be off again through the air.\"\n\n\"But, should the wind bear us away?\"\n\n\"Happily, it will not. See, Dick! it is carrying us back to the lake;\nand this circumstance, which would have been vexatious yesterday, is\nfortunate now. Our efforts, then, will be limited to keeping ourselves\nabove that vast sheet of water throughout the day. Joe cannot fail\nto see us, and his eyes will be constantly on the lookout in that\ndirection. Perhaps he will even manage to let us know the place of his\nretreat.\"\n\n\"If he be alone and at liberty, he certainly will.\"\n\n\"And if a prisoner,\" resumed the doctor, \"it not being the practice of\nthe natives to confine their captives, he will see us, and comprehend\nthe object of our researches.\"\n\n\"But, at last,\" put in Kennedy--\"for we must anticipate every\nthing--should we find no trace--if he should have left no mark to follow\nhim by, what are we to do?\"\n\n\"We shall endeavor to regain the northern part of the lake, keeping\nourselves as much in sight as possible. There we'll wait; we'll explore\nthe banks; we'll search the water's edge, for Joe will assuredly try to\nreach the shore; and we will not leave the country without having done\nevery thing to find him.\"\n\n\"Let us set out, then!\" said the hunter.\n\nThe doctor hereupon took the exact bearings of the patch of solid land\nthey were about to leave, and arrived at the conclusion that it lay\non the north shore of Lake Tchad, between the village of Lari and the\nvillage of Ingemini, both visited by Major Denham. During this time\nKennedy was completing his stock of fresh meat. Although the neighboring\nmarshes showed traces of the rhinoceros, the lamantine (or manatee),\nand the hippopotamus, he had no opportunity to see a single specimen of\nthose animals.\n\nAt seven in the morning, but not without great difficulty--which to\nJoe would have been nothing--the balloon's anchor was detached from its\nhold, the gas dilated, and the new Victoria rose two hundred feet into\nthe air. It seemed to hesitate at first, and went spinning around, like\na top; but at last a brisk current caught it, and it advanced over the\nlake, and was soon borne away at a speed of twenty miles per hour.\n\nThe doctor continued to keep at a height of from two hundred to five\nhundred feet. Kennedy frequently discharged his rifle; and, when\npassing over islands, the aeronauts approached them even imprudently,\nscrutinizing the thickets, the bushes, the underbrush--in fine, every\nspot where a mass of shade or jutting rock could have afforded a retreat\nto their companion. They swooped down close to the long pirogues that\nnavigated the lake; and the wild fishermen, terrified at the sight of\nthe balloon, would plunge into the water and regain their islands with\nevery symptom of undisguised affright.\n\n\"We can see nothing,\" said Kennedy, after two hours of search.\n\n\"Let us wait a little longer, Dick, and not lose heart. We cannot be far\naway from the scene of our accident.\"\n\nBy eleven o'clock the balloon had gone ninety miles. It then fell in\nwith a new current, which, blowing almost at right angles to the other,\ndrove them eastward about sixty miles. It next floated over a very large\nand populous island, which the doctor took to be Farram, on which the\ncapital of the Biddiomahs is situated. Ferguson expected at every moment\nto see Joe spring up out of some thicket, flying for his life, and\ncalling for help. Were he free, they could pick him up without trouble;\nwere he a prisoner, they could rescue him by repeating the manoeuvre\nthey had practised to save the missionary, and he would soon be with\nhis friends again; but nothing was seen, not a sound was heard. The case\nseemed desperate.\n\nAbout half-past two o'clock, the Victoria hove in sight of Tangalia, a\nvillage situated on the eastern shore of Lake Tchad, where it marks the\nextreme point attained by Denham at the period of his exploration.\n\nThe doctor became uneasy at this persistent setting of the wind in that\ndirection, for he felt that he was being thrown back to the eastward,\ntoward the centre of Africa, and the interminable deserts of that\nregion.\n\n\"We must absolutely come to a halt,\" said he, \"and even alight. For\nJoe's sake, particularly, we ought to go back to the lake; but, to begin\nwith, let us endeavor to find an opposite current.\"\n\nDuring more than an hour he searched at different altitudes: the balloon\nalways came back toward the mainland. But at length, at the height of a\nthousand feet, a very violent breeze swept to the northwestward.\n\nIt was out of the question that Joe should have been detained on one of\nthe islands of the lake; for, in such case he would certainly have found\nmeans to make his presence there known. Perhaps he had been dragged to\nthe mainland. The doctor was reasoning thus to himself, when he again\ncame in sight of the northern shore of Lake Tchad.\n\nAs for supposing that Joe had been drowned, that was not to be believed\nfor a moment. One horrible thought glanced across the minds of both\nKennedy and the doctor: caymans swarm in these waters! But neither one\nnor the other had the courage to distinctly communicate this impression.\nHowever, it came up to them so forcibly at last that the doctor said,\nwithout further preface:\n\n\"Crocodiles are found only on the shores of the islands or of the lake,\nand Joe will have skill enough to avoid them. Besides, they are not very\ndangerous; and the Africans bathe with impunity, and quite fearless of\ntheir attacks.\"\n\nKennedy made no reply. He preferred keeping quiet to discussing this\nterrible possibility.\n\nThe doctor made out the town of Lari about five o'clock in the evening.\nThe inhabitants were at work gathering in their cotton-crop in front\nof their huts, constructed of woven reeds, and standing in the midst\nof clean and neatly-kept enclosures. This collection of about fifty\nhabitations occupied a slight depression of the soil, in a valley\nextending between two low mountains. The force of the wind carried the\ndoctor farther onward than he wanted to go; but it changed a second\ntime, and bore him back exactly to his starting-point, on the sort of\nenclosed island where he had passed the preceding night. The anchor,\ninstead of catching the branches of the tree, took hold in the masses\nof reeds mixed with the thick mud of the marshes, which offered\nconsiderable resistance.\n\nThe doctor had much difficulty in restraining the balloon; but at length\nthe wind died away with the setting in of nightfall; and the two friends\nkept watch together in an almost desperate state of mind.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-FOURTH.\n\nThe Hurricane.--A Forced Departure.--Loss of an Anchor.--Melancholy\nReflections.--The Resolution adopted.--The Sand-Storm.--The Buried\nCaravan.--A Contrary yet Favorable Wind.--The Return southward.--Kennedy\nat his Post.\n\nAt three o'clock in the morning the wind was raging. It beat down with\nsuch violence that the Victoria could not stay near the ground without\ndanger. It was thrown almost flat over upon its side, and the reeds\nchafed the silk so roughly that it seemed as though they would tear it.\n\n\"We must be off, Dick,\" said the doctor; \"we cannot remain in this\nsituation.\"\n\n\"But, doctor, what of Joe?\"\n\n\"I am not likely to abandon him. No, indeed! and should the hurricane\ncarry me a thousand miles to the northward, I will return! But here we\nare endangering the safety of all.\"\n\n\"Must we go without him?\" asked the Scot, with an accent of profound\ngrief.\n\n\"And do you think, then,\" rejoined Ferguson, \"that my heart does not\nbleed like your own? Am I not merely obeying an imperious necessity?\"\n\n\"I am entirely at your orders,\" replied the hunter; \"let us start!\"\n\nBut their departure was surrounded with unusual difficulty. The anchor,\nwhich had caught very deeply, resisted all their efforts to disengage\nit; while the balloon, drawing in the opposite direction, increased\nits tension. Kennedy could not get it free. Besides, in his present\nposition, the manoeuvre had become a very perilous one, for the Victoria\nthreatened to break away before he should be able to get into the car\nagain.\n\nThe doctor, unwilling to run such a risk, made his friend get into\nhis place, and resigned himself to the alternative of cutting the\nanchor-rope. The Victoria made one bound of three hundred feet into the\nair, and took her route directly northward.\n\nFerguson had no other choice than to scud before the storm. He folded\nhis arms, and soon became absorbed in his own melancholy reflections.\n\nAfter a few moments of profound silence, he turned to Kennedy, who sat\nthere no less taciturn.\n\n\"We have, perhaps, been tempting Providence,\" said he; \"it does not\nbelong to man to undertake such a journey!\"--and a sigh of grief escaped\nhim as he spoke.\n\n\"It is but a few days,\" replied the sportsman, \"since we were\ncongratulating ourselves upon having escaped so many dangers! All three\nof us were shaking hands!\"\n\n\"Poor Joe! kindly and excellent disposition! brave and candid heart!\nDazzled for a moment by his sudden discovery of wealth, he willingly\nsacrificed his treasures! And now, he is far from us; and the wind is\ncarrying us still farther away with resistless speed!\"\n\n\"Come, doctor, admitting that he may have found refuge among the lake\ntribes, can he not do as the travellers who visited them before us,\ndid;--like Denham, like Barth? Both of those men got back to their own\ncountry.\"\n\n\"Ah! my dear Dick! Joe doesn't know one word of the language; he is\nalone, and without resources. The travellers of whom you speak did not\nattempt to go forward without sending many presents in advance of them\nto the chiefs, and surrounded by an escort armed and trained for\nthese expeditions. Yet, they could not avoid sufferings of the worst\ndescription! What, then, can you expect the fate of our companion to be?\nIt is horrible to think of, and this is one of the worst calamities that\nit has ever been my lot to endure!\"\n\n\"But, we'll come back again, doctor!\"\n\n\"Come back, Dick? Yes, if we have to abandon the balloon! if we\nshould be forced to return to Lake Tchad on foot, and put ourselves in\ncommunication with the Sultan of Bornou! The Arabs cannot have retained\na disagreeable remembrance of the first Europeans.\"\n\n\"I will follow you, doctor,\" replied the hunter, with emphasis. \"You\nmay count upon me! We would rather give up the idea of prosecuting\nthis journey than not return. Joe forgot himself for our sake; we will\nsacrifice ourselves for his!\"\n\nThis resolve revived some hope in the hearts of these two men; they felt\nstrong in the same inspiration. Ferguson forthwith set every thing at\nwork to get into a contrary current, that might bring him back again\nto Lake Tchad; but this was impracticable at that moment, and even to\nalight was out of the question on ground completely bare of trees, and\nwith such a hurricane blowing.\n\nThe Victoria thus passed over the country of the Tibbous, crossed the\nBelad el Djerid, a desert of briers that forms the border of the Soudan,\nand advanced into the desert of sand streaked with the long tracks\nof the many caravans that pass and repass there. The last line of\nvegetation was speedily lost in the dim southern horizon, not far from\nthe principal oasis in this part of Africa, whose fifty wells are shaded\nby magnificent trees; but it was impossible to stop. An Arab encampment,\ntents of striped stuff, some camels, stretching out their viper-like\nheads and necks along the sand, gave life to this solitude, but the\nVictoria sped by like a shooting-star, and in this way traversed a\ndistance of sixty miles in three hours, without Ferguson being able to\ncheck or guide her course.\n\n\"We cannot halt, we cannot alight!\" said the doctor; \"not a tree, not an\ninequality of the ground! Are we then to be driven clear across Sahara?\nSurely, Heaven is indeed against us!\"\n\nHe was uttering these words with a sort of despairing rage, when\nsuddenly he saw the desert sands rising aloft in the midst of a dense\ncloud of dust, and go whirling through the air, impelled by opposing\ncurrents.\n\nAmid this tornado, an entire caravan, disorganized, broken, and\noverthrown, was disappearing beneath an avalanche of sand. The camels,\nflung pell-mell together, were uttering dull and pitiful groans; cries\nand howls of despair were heard issuing from that dusty and stifling\ncloud, and, from time to time, a parti-colored garment cut the chaos\nof the scene with its vivid hues, and the moaning and shrieking sounded\nover all, a terrible accompaniment to this spectacle of destruction.\n\nEre long the sand had accumulated in compact masses; and there, where so\nrecently stretched a level plain as far as the eye could see, rose now\na ridgy line of hillocks, still moving from beneath--the vast tomb of an\nentire caravan!\n\nThe doctor and Kennedy, pallid with emotion, sat transfixed by this\nfearful spectacle. They could no longer manage their balloon, which went\nwhirling round and round in contending currents, and refused to obey\nthe different dilations of the gas. Caught in these eddies of the\natmosphere, it spun about with a rapidity that made their heads reel,\nwhile the car oscillated and swung to and fro violently at the same\ntime. The instruments suspended under the awning clattered together as\nthough they would be dashed to pieces; the pipes of the spiral bent\nto and fro, threatening to break at every instant; and the water-tanks\njostled and jarred with tremendous din. Although but two feet apart,\nour aeronauts could not hear each other speak, but with firmly-clinched\nhands they clung convulsively to the cordage, and endeavored to steady\nthemselves against the fury of the tempest.\n\nKennedy, with his hair blown wildly about his face, looked on without\nspeaking; but the doctor had regained all his daring in the midst of\nthis deadly peril, and not a sign of his emotion was betrayed in his\ncountenance, even when, after a last violent twirl, the Victoria stopped\nsuddenly in the midst of a most unlooked-for calm; the north wind had\nabruptly got the upper hand, and now drove her back with equal rapidity\nover the route she had traversed in the morning.\n\n\"Whither are we going now?\" cried Kennedy.\n\n\"Let us leave that to Providence, my dear Dick; I was wrong in doubting\nit. It knows better than we, and here we are, returning to places that\nwe had expected never to see again!\"\n\nThe surface of the country, which had looked so flat and level when they\nwere coming, now seemed tossed and uneven, like the ocean-billows after\na storm; a long succession of hillocks, that had scarcely settled to\ntheir places yet, indented the desert; the wind blew furiously, and the\nballoon fairly flew through the atmosphere.\n\nThe direction taken by our aeronauts differed somewhat from that of\nthe morning, and thus about nine o'clock, instead of finding themselves\nagain near the borders of Lake Tchad, they saw the desert still\nstretching away before them.\n\nKennedy remarked the circumstance.\n\n\"It matters little,\" replied the doctor, \"the important point is to\nreturn southward; we shall come across the towns of Bornou, Wouddie, or\nKouka, and I should not hesitate to halt there.\"\n\n\"If you are satisfied, I am content,\" replied the Scot, \"but Heaven\ngrant that we may not be reduced to cross the desert, as those\nunfortunate Arabs had to do! What we saw was frightful!\"\n\n\"It often happens, Dick; these trips across the desert are far more\nperilous than those across the ocean. The desert has all the dangers of\nthe sea, including the risk of being swallowed up, and added thereto are\nunendurable fatigues and privations.\"\n\n\"I think the wind shows some symptoms of moderating; the sand-dust is\nless dense; the undulations of the surface are diminishing, and the sky\nis growing clearer.\"\n\n\"So much the better! We must now reconnoitre attentively with our\nglasses, and take care not to omit a single point.\"\n\n\"I will look out for that, doctor, and not a tree shall be seen without\nmy informing you of it.\"\n\nAnd, suiting the action to the word, Kennedy took his station, spy-glass\nin hand, at the forward part of the car.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-FIFTH.\n\nWhat happened to Joe.--The Island of the Biddiomahs.--The Adoration\nshown him.--The Island that sank.--The Shores of the Lake.--The Tree\nof the Serpents.--The Foot-Tramp.--Terrible Suffering.--Mosquitoes and\nAnts.--Hunger.--The Victoria seen.--She disappears.--The Swamp.--One\nLast Despairing Cry.\n\nWhat had become of Joe, while his master was thus vainly seeking for\nhim?\n\nWhen he had dashed headlong into the lake, his first movement on\ncoming to the surface was to raise his eyes and look upward. He saw the\nVictoria already risen far above the water, still rapidly ascending and\ngrowing smaller and smaller. It was soon caught in a rapid current and\ndisappeared to the northward. His master--both his friends were saved!\n\n\"How lucky it was,\" thought he, \"that I had that idea to throw myself\nout into the lake! Mr. Kennedy would soon have jumped at it, and he\nwould not have hesitated to do as I did, for nothing's more natural than\nfor one man to give himself up to save two others. That's mathematics!\"\n\nSatisfied on this point, Joe began to think of himself. He was in the\nmiddle of a vast lake, surrounded by tribes unknown to him, and probably\nferocious. All the greater reason why he should get out of the scrape\nby depending only on himself. And so he gave himself no farther concern\nabout it.\n\nBefore the attack by the birds of prey, which, according to him, had\nbehaved like real condors, he had noticed an island on the horizon, and\ndetermining to reach it, if possible, he put forth all his knowledge and\nskill in the art of swimming, after having relieved himself of the most\ntroublesome part of his clothing. The idea of a stretch of five or six\nmiles by no means disconcerted him; and therefore, so long as he was\nin the open lake, he thought only of striking out straight ahead and\nmanfully.\n\nIn about an hour and a half the distance between him and the island had\ngreatly diminished.\n\nBut as he approached the land, a thought, at first fleeting and then\ntenacious, arose in his mind. He knew that the shores of the lake were\nfrequented by huge alligators, and was well aware of the voracity of\nthose monsters.\n\nNow, no matter how much he was inclined to find every thing in this\nworld quite natural, the worthy fellow was no little disturbed by\nthis reflection. He feared greatly lest white flesh like his might be\nparticularly acceptable to the dreaded brutes, and advanced only with\nextreme precaution, his eyes on the alert on both sides and all around\nhim. At length, he was not more than one hundred yards from a bank,\ncovered with green trees, when a puff of air strongly impregnated with a\nmusky odor reached him.\n\n\"There!\" said he to himself, \"just what I expected. The crocodile isn't\nfar off!\"\n\nWith this he dived swiftly, but not sufficiently so to avoid coming into\ncontact with an enormous body, the scaly surface of which scratched him\nas he passed. He thought himself lost and swam with desperate energy.\nThen he rose again to the top of the water, took breath and dived once\nmore. Thus passed a few minutes of unspeakable anguish, which all his\nphilosophy could not overcome, for he thought, all the while, that\nhe heard behind him the sound of those huge jaws ready to snap him up\nforever. In this state of mind he was striking out under the water as\nnoiselessly as possible when he felt himself seized by the arm and then\nby the waist.\n\nPoor Joe! he gave one last thought to his master; and began to struggle\nwith all the energy of despair, feeling himself the while drawn along,\nbut not toward the bottom of the lake, as is the habit of the crocodile\nwhen about to devour its prey, but toward the surface.\n\nSo soon as he could get breath and look around him, he saw that he was\nbetween two natives as black as ebony, who held him, with a firm gripe,\nand uttered strange cries.\n\n\"Ha!\" said Joe, \"blacks instead of crocodiles! Well, I prefer it as it\nis; but how in the mischief dare these fellows go in bathing in such\nplaces?\"\n\nJoe was not aware that the inhabitants of the islands of Lake Tchad,\nlike many other negro tribes, plunge with impunity into sheets of water\ninfested with crocodiles and caymans, and without troubling their heads\nabout them. The amphibious denizens of this lake enjoy the well-deserved\nreputation of being quite inoffensive.\n\nBut had not Joe escaped one peril only to fall into another? That was\na question which he left events to decide; and, since he could not\ndo otherwise, he allowed himself to be conducted to the shore without\nmanifesting any alarm.\n\n\"Evidently,\" thought he, \"these chaps saw the Victoria skimming the\nwaters of the lake, like a monster of the air. They were the distant\nwitnesses of my tumble, and they can't fail to have some respect for a\nman that fell from the sky! Let them have their own way, then.\"\n\nJoe was at this stage of his meditations, when he was landed amid a\nyelling crowd of both sexes, and all ages and sizes, but not of all\ncolors. In fine, he was surrounded by a tribe of Biddiomahs as black as\njet. Nor had he to blush for the scantiness of his costume, for he saw\nthat he was in \"undress\" in the highest style of that country.\n\nBut before he had time to form an exact idea of the situation, there was\nno mistaking the agitation of which he instantly became the object, and\nthis soon enabled him to pluck up courage, although the adventure of\nKazah did come back rather vividly to his memory.\n\n\"I foresee that they are going to make a god of me again,\" thought he,\n\"some son of the moon most likely. Well, one trade's as good as another\nwhen a man has no choice. The main thing is to gain time. Should the\nVictoria pass this way again, I'll take advantage of my new position\nto treat my worshippers here to a miracle when I go sailing up into the\nsky!\"\n\nWhile Joe's thoughts were running thus, the throng pressed around him.\nThey prostrated themselves before him; they howled; they felt him;\nthey became even annoyingly familiar; but at the same time they had the\nconsideration to offer him a superb banquet consisting of sour milk\nand rice pounded in honey. The worthy fellow, making the best of every\nthing, took one of the heartiest luncheons he ever ate in his life, and\ngave his new adorers an exalted idea of how the gods tuck away their\nfood upon grand occasions.\n\nWhen evening came, the sorcerers of the island took him respectfully\nby the hand, and conducted him to a sort of house surrounded with\ntalismans; but, as he was entering it, Joe cast an uneasy look at the\nheaps of human bones that lay scattered around this sanctuary. But he\nhad still more time to think about them when he found himself at last\nshut up in the cabin.\n\nDuring the evening and through a part of the night, he heard festive\nchantings, the reverberations of a kind of drum, and a clatter of old\niron, which were very sweet, no doubt, to African ears. Then there were\nhowling choruses, accompanied by endless dances by gangs of natives who\ncircled round and round the sacred hut with contortions and grimaces.\n\nJoe could catch the sound of this deafening orchestra, through the\nmud and reeds of which his cabin was built; and perhaps under other\ncircumstances he might have been amused by these strange ceremonies;\nbut his mind was soon disturbed by quite different and less agreeable\nreflections. Even looking at the bright side of things, he found it both\nstupid and sad to be left alone in the midst of this savage country\nand among these wild tribes. Few travellers who had penetrated to these\nregions had ever again seen their native land. Moreover, could he trust\nto the worship of which he saw himself the object? He had good reason to\nbelieve in the vanity of human greatness; and he asked himself whether,\nin this country, adoration did not sometimes go to the length of eating\nthe object adored!\n\nBut, notwithstanding this rather perplexing prospect, after some hours\nof meditation, fatigue got the better of his gloomy thoughts, and Joe\nfell into a profound slumber, which would have lasted no doubt until\nsunrise, had not a very unexpected sensation of dampness awakened the\nsleeper. Ere long this dampness became water, and that water gained so\nrapidly that it had soon mounted to Joe's waist.\n\n\"What can this be?\" said he; \"a flood! a water-spout! or a new torture\ninvented by these blacks? Faith, though, I'm not going to wait here till\nit's up to my neck!\"\n\nAnd, so saying, he burst through the frail wall with a jog of his\npowerful shoulder, and found himself--where?--in the open lake! Island\nthere was none. It had sunk during the night. In its place, the watery\nimmensity of Lake Tchad!\n\n\"A poor country for the land-owners!\" said Joe, once more vigorously\nresorting to his skill in the art of natation.\n\nOne of those phenomena, which are by no means unusual on Lake Tchad, had\nliberated our brave Joe. More than one island, that previously seemed\nto have the solidity of rock, has been submerged in this way; and the\npeople living along the shores of the mainland have had to pick up the\nunfortunate survivors of these terrible catastrophes.\n\nJoe knew nothing about this peculiarity of the region, but he was none\nthe less ready to profit by it. He caught sight of a boat drifting\nabout, without occupants, and was soon aboard of it. He found it to be\nbut the trunk of a tree rudely hollowed out; but there were a couple of\npaddles in it, and Joe, availing himself of a rapid current, allowed his\ncraft to float along.\n\n\"But let us see where we are,\" he said. \"The polar-star there, that does\nits work honorably in pointing out the direction due north to everybody\nelse, will, most likely, do me that service.\"\n\nHe discovered, with satisfaction, that the current was taking him toward\nthe northern shore of the lake, and he allowed himself to glide with\nit. About two o'clock in the morning he disembarked upon a promontory\ncovered with prickly reeds, that proved very provoking and inconvenient\neven to a philosopher like him; but a tree grew there expressly to offer\nhim a bed among its branches, and Joe climbed up into it for greater\nsecurity, and there, without sleeping much, however, awaited the dawn of\nday.\n\nWhen morning had come with that suddenness which is peculiar to the\nequatorial regions, Joe cast a glance at the tree which had sheltered\nhim during the last few hours, and beheld a sight that chilled the\nmarrow in his bones. The branches of the tree were literally covered\nwith snakes and chameleons! The foliage actually was hidden beneath\ntheir coils, so that the beholder might have fancied that he saw before\nhim a new kind of tree that bore reptiles for its leaves and fruit. And\nall this horrible living mass writhed and twisted in the first rays of\nthe morning sun! Joe experienced a keen sensation or terror mingled with\ndisgust, as he looked at it, and he leaped precipitately from the tree\namid the hissings of these new and unwelcome bedfellows.\n\n\"Now, there's something that I would never have believed!\" said he.\n\nHe was not aware that Dr. Vogel's last letters had made known this\nsingular feature of the shores of Lake Tchad, where reptiles are more\nnumerous than in any other part of the world. But after what he had just\nseen, Joe determined to be more circumspect for the future; and, taking\nhis bearings by the sun, he set off afoot toward the northeast,\navoiding with the utmost care cabins, huts, hovels, and dens of every\ndescription, that might serve in any manner as a shelter for human\nbeings.\n\nHow often his gaze was turned upward to the sky! He hoped to catch a\nglimpse, each time, of the Victoria; and, although he looked vainly\nduring all that long, fatiguing day of sore foot-travel, his confident\nreliance on his master remained undiminished. Great energy of character\nwas needed to enable him thus to sustain the situation with philosophy.\nHunger conspired with fatigue to crush him, for a man's system is not\ngreatly restored and fortified by a diet of roots, the pith of plants,\nsuch as the Mele, or the fruit of the doum palm-tree; and yet, according\nto his own calculations, Joe was enabled to push on about twenty miles\nto the westward.\n\nHis body bore in scores of places the marks of the thorns with which the\nlake-reeds, the acacias, the mimosas, and other wild shrubbery through\nwhich he had to force his way, are thickly studded; and his torn and\nbleeding feet rendered walking both painful and difficult. But at length\nhe managed to react against all these sufferings; and when evening came\nagain, he resolved to pass the night on the shores of Lake Tchad.\n\nThere he had to endure the bites of myriads of insects--gnats,\nmosquitoes, ants half an inch long, literally covered the ground; and,\nin less than two hours, Joe had not a rag remaining of the garments that\nhad covered him, the insects having devoured them! It was a terrible\nnight, that did not yield our exhausted traveller an hour of sleep.\nDuring all this time the wild-boars and native buffaloes, reenforced\nby the ajoub--a very dangerous species of lamantine--carried on their\nferocious revels in the bushes and under the waters of the lake, filling\nthe night with a hideous concert. Joe dared scarcely breathe. Even his\ncourage and coolness had hard work to bear up against so terrible a\nsituation.\n\nAt length, day came again, and Joe sprang to his feet precipitately; but\njudge of the loathing he felt when he saw what species of creature\nhad shared his couch--a toad!--but a toad five inches in length, a\nmonstrous, repulsive specimen of vermin that sat there staring at him\nwith huge round eyes. Joe felt his stomach revolt at the sight, and,\nregaining a little strength from the intensity of his repugnance, he\nrushed at the top of his speed and plunged into the lake. This sudden\nbath somewhat allayed the pangs of the itching that tortured his whole\nbody; and, chewing a few leaves, he set forth resolutely, again feeling\nan obstinate resolution in the act, for which he could hardly account\neven to his own mind. He no longer seemed to have entire control of his\nown acts, and, nevertheless, he felt within him a strength superior to\ndespair.\n\nHowever, he began now to suffer terribly from hunger. His stomach, less\nresigned than he was, rebelled, and he was obliged to fasten a tendril\nof wild-vine tightly about his waist. Fortunately, he could quench his\nthirst at any moment, and, in recalling the sufferings he had undergone\nin the desert, he experienced comparative relief in his exemption from\nthat other distressing want.\n\n\"What can have become of the Victoria?\" he wondered. \"The wind blows\nfrom the north, and she should be carried back by it toward the lake.\nNo doubt the doctor has gone to work to right her balance, but yesterday\nwould have given him time enough for that, so that may be to-day--but I\nmust act just as if I was never to see him again. After all, if I only\nget to one of the large towns on the lake, I'll find myself no worse off\nthan the travellers my master used to talk about. Why shouldn't I work\nmy way out of the scrape as well as they did? Some of them got back home\nagain. Come, then! the deuce! Cheer up, my boy!\"\n\nThus talking to himself and walking on rapidly, Joe came right upon a\nhorde of natives in the very depths of the forest, but he halted in time\nand was not seen by them. The negroes were busy poisoning arrows with\nthe juice of the euphorbium--a piece of work deemed a great affair among\nthese savage tribes, and carried on with a sort of ceremonial solemnity.\n\nJoe, entirely motionless and even holding his breath, was keeping\nhimself concealed in a thicket, when, happening to raise his eyes, he\nsaw through an opening in the foliage the welcome apparition of the\nballoon--the Victoria herself--moving toward the lake, at a height of\nonly about one hundred feet above him. But he could not make himself\nheard; he dared not, could not make his friends even see him!\n\nTears came to his eyes, not of grief but of thankfulness; his master was\nthen seeking him; his master had not left him to perish! He would\nhave to wait for the departure of the blacks; then he could quit his\nhiding-place and run toward the borders of Lake Tchad!\n\nBut by this time the Victoria was disappearing in the distant sky.\nJoe still determined to wait for her; she would come back again,\nundoubtedly. She did, indeed, return, but farther to the eastward.\nJoe ran, gesticulated, shouted--but all in vain! A strong breeze was\nsweeping the balloon away with a speed that deprived him of all hope.\n\nFor the first time, energy and confidence abandoned the heart of the\nunfortunate man. He saw that he was lost. He thought his master gone\nbeyond all prospect of return. He dared no longer think; he would no\nlonger reflect!\n\nLike a crazy man, his feet bleeding, his body cut and torn, he walked\non during all that day and a part of the next night. He even dragged\nhimself along, sometimes on his knees, sometimes with his hands. He saw\nthe moment nigh when all his strength would fail, and nothing would be\nleft to him but to sink upon the ground and die.\n\nThus working his way along, he at length found himself close to a marsh,\nor what he knew would soon become a marsh, for night had set in some\nhours before, and he fell by a sudden misstep into a thick, clinging\nmire. In spite of all his efforts, in spite of his desperate struggles,\nhe felt himself sinking gradually in the swampy ooze, and in a few\nminutes he was buried to his waist.\n\n\"Here, then, at last, is death!\" he thought, in agony, \"and what a\ndeath!\"\n\nHe now began to struggle again, like a madman; but his efforts only\nserved to bury him deeper in the tomb that the poor doomed lad was\nhollowing for himself; not a log of wood or a branch to buoy him up;\nnot a reed to which he might cling! He felt that all was over! His eyes\nconvulsively closed!\n\n\"Master! master!--Help!\" were his last words; but his voice, despairing,\nunaided, half stifled already by the rising mire, died away feebly on\nthe night.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SIXTH.\n\nA Throng of People on the Horizon.--A Troop of Arabs.--The Pursuit.--It\nis He.--Fall from Horseback.--The Strangled Arab.--A Ball from\nKennedy.--Adroit Manoeuvres.--Caught up flying.--Joe saved at last.\n\nFrom the moment when Kennedy resumed his post of observation in the\nfront of the car, he had not ceased to watch the horizon with his utmost\nattention.\n\nAfter the lapse of some time he turned toward the doctor and said:\n\n\"If I am not greatly mistaken I can see, off yonder in the distance, a\nthrong of men or animals moving. It is impossible to make them out yet,\nbut I observe that they are in violent motion, for they are raising a\ngreat cloud of dust.\"\n\n\"May it not be another contrary breeze?\" said the doctor, \"another\nwhirlwind coming to drive us back northward again?\" and while speaking\nhe stood up to examine the horizon.\n\n\"I think not, Samuel; it is a troop of gazelles or of wild oxen.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so, Dick; but yon throng is some nine or ten miles from us at\nleast, and on my part, even with the glass, I can make nothing of it!\"\n\n\"At all events I shall not lose sight of it. There is something\nremarkable about it that excites my curiosity. Sometimes it looks like\na body of cavalry manoeuvring. Ah! I was not mistaken. It is, indeed, a\nsquadron of horsemen. Look--look there!\"\n\nThe doctor eyed the group with great attention, and, after a moment's\npause, remarked:\n\n\"I believe that you are right. It is a detachment of Arabs or Tibbous,\nand they are galloping in the same direction with us, as though in\nflight, but we are going faster than they, and we are rapidly gaining on\nthem. In half an hour we shall be near enough to see them and know what\nthey are.\"\n\nKennedy had again lifted his glass and was attentively scrutinizing\nthem. Meanwhile the crowd of horsemen was becoming more distinctly\nvisible, and a few were seen to detach themselves from the main body.\n\n\"It is some hunting manoeuvre, evidently,\" said Kennedy. \"Those fellows\nseem to be in pursuit of something. I would like to know what they are\nabout.\"\n\n\"Patience, Dick! In a little while we shall overtake them, if they\ncontinue on the same route. We are going at the rate of twenty miles per\nhour, and no horse can keep up with that.\"\n\nKennedy again raised his glass, and a few minutes later he exclaimed:\n\n\"They are Arabs, galloping at the top of their speed; I can make\nthem out distinctly. They are about fifty in number. I can see their\nbournouses puffed out by the wind. It is some cavalry exercise that they\nare going through. Their chief is a hundred paces ahead of them and they\nare rushing after him at headlong speed.\"\n\n\"Whoever they may be, Dick, they are not to be feared, and then, if\nnecessary, we can go higher.\"\n\n\"Wait, doctor--wait a little!\"\n\n\"It's curious,\" said Kennedy again, after a brief pause, \"but there's\nsomething going on that I can't exactly explain. By the efforts they\nmake, and the irregularity of their line, I should fancy that those\nArabs are pursuing some one, instead of following.\"\n\n\"Are you certain of that, Dick?\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, it's clear enough now. I am right! It is a pursuit--a\nhunt--but a man-hunt! That is not their chief riding ahead of them, but\na fugitive.\"\n\n\"A fugitive!\" exclaimed the doctor, growing more and more interested.\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"Don't lose sight of him, and let us wait!\"\n\nThree or four miles more were quickly gained upon these horsemen, who\nnevertheless were dashing onward with incredible speed.\n\n\"Doctor! doctor!\" shouted Kennedy in an agitated voice.\n\n\"What is the matter, Dick?\"\n\n\"Is it an illusion? Can it be possible?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Wait!\" and so saying, the Scot wiped the sights of his spy-glass\ncarefully, and looked through it again intently.\n\n\"Well?\" questioned the doctor.\n\n\"It is he, doctor!\"\n\n\"He!\" exclaimed Ferguson with emotion.\n\n\"It is he! no other!\" and it was needless to pronounce the name.\n\n\"Yes! it is he! on horseback, and only a hundred paces in advance of his\nenemies! He is pursued!\"\n\n\"It is Joe--Joe himself!\" cried the doctor, turning pale.\n\n\"He cannot see us in his flight!\"\n\n\"He will see us, though!\" said the doctor, lowering the flame of his\nblow-pipe.\n\n\"But how?\"\n\n\"In five minutes we shall be within fifty feet of the ground, and in\nfifteen we shall be right over him!\"\n\n\"We must let him know it by firing a gun!\"\n\n\"No! he can't turn back to come this way. He's headed off!\"\n\n\"What shall we do, then?\"\n\n\"We must wait.\"\n\n\"Wait?--and these Arabs!\"\n\n\"We shall overtake them. We'll pass them. We are not more than two miles\nfrom them, and provided that Joe's horse holds out!\"\n\n\"Great God!\" exclaimed Kennedy, suddenly.\n\n\"What is the matter?\"\n\nKennedy had uttered a cry of despair as he saw Joe fling himself to the\nground. His horse, evidently exhausted, had just fallen headlong.\n\n\"He sees us!\" cried the doctor, \"and he motions to us, as he gets upon\nhis feet!\"\n\n\"But the Arabs will overtake him! What is he waiting for? Ah! the brave\nlad! Huzza!\" shouted the sportsman, who could no longer restrain his\nfeelings.\n\nJoe, who had immediately sprung up after his fall, just as one of the\nswiftest horsemen rushed upon him, bounded like a panther, avoided his\nassailant by leaping to one side, jumped up behind him on the crupper,\nseized the Arab by the throat, and, strangling him with his sinewy hands\nand fingers of steel, flung him on the sand, and continued his headlong\nflight.\n\nA tremendous howl was heard from the Arabs, but, completely engrossed by\nthe pursuit, they had not taken notice of the balloon, which was now\nbut five hundred paces behind them, and only about thirty feet from the\nground. On their part, they were not twenty lengths of their horses from\nthe fugitive.\n\nOne of them was very perceptibly gaining on Joe, and was about to\npierce him with his lance, when Kennedy, with fixed eye and steady hand,\nstopped him short with a ball, that hurled him to the earth.\n\nJoe did not even turn his head at the report. Some of the horsemen\nreined in their barbs, and fell on their faces in the dust as they\ncaught sight of the Victoria; the rest continued their pursuit.\n\n\"But what is Joe about?\" said Kennedy; \"he don't stop!\"\n\n\"He's doing better than that, Dick! I understand him! He's keeping on in\nthe same direction as the balloon. He relies upon our intelligence. Ah!\nthe noble fellow! We'll carry him off in the very teeth of those Arab\nrascals! We are not more than two hundred paces from him!\"\n\n\"What are we to do?\" asked Kennedy.\n\n\"Lay aside your rifle, Dick.\"\n\nAnd the Scot obeyed the request at once.\n\n\"Do you think that you can hold one hundred and fifty pounds of ballast\nin your arms?\"\n\n\"Ay, more than that!\"\n\n\"No! That will be enough!\"\n\nAnd the doctor proceeded to pile up bags of sand in Kennedy's arms.\n\n\"Hold yourself in readiness in the back part of the car, and be prepared\nto throw out that ballast at a single effort. But, for your life, don't\ndo so until I give the word!\"\n\n\"Be easy on that point.\"\n\n\"Otherwise, we should miss Joe, and he would be lost.\"\n\n\"Count upon me!\"\n\nThe Victoria at that moment almost commanded the troop of horsemen who\nwere still desperately urging their steeds at Joe's heels. The doctor,\nstanding in the front of the car, held the ladder clear, ready to throw\nit at any moment. Meanwhile, Joe had still maintained the distance\nbetween himself and his pursuers--say about fifty feet. The Victoria was\nnow ahead of the party.\n\n\"Attention!\" exclaimed the doctor to Kennedy.\n\n\"I'm ready!\"\n\n\"Joe, look out for yourself!\" shouted the doctor in his sonorous,\nringing voice, as he flung out the ladder, the lowest ratlines of which\ntossed up the dust of the road.\n\nAs the doctor shouted, Joe had turned his head, but without checking his\nhorse. The ladder dropped close to him, and at the instant he grasped it\nthe doctor again shouted to Kennedy:\n\n\"Throw ballast!\"\n\n\"It's done!\"\n\nAnd the Victoria, lightened by a weight greater than Joe's, shot up one\nhundred and fifty feet into the air.\n\nJoe clung with all his strength to the ladder during the wide\noscillations that it had to describe, and then making an indescribable\ngesture to the Arabs, and climbing with the agility of a monkey, he\nsprang up to his companions, who received him with open arms.\n\nThe Arabs uttered a scream of astonishment and rage. The fugitive\nhad been snatched from them on the wing, and the Victoria was rapidly\nspeeding far beyond their reach.\n\n\"Master! Kennedy!\" ejaculated Joe, and overwhelmed, at last, with\nfatigue and emotion, the poor fellow fainted away, while Kennedy, almost\nbeside himself, kept exclaiming:\n\n\"Saved--saved!\"\n\n\"Saved indeed!\" murmured the doctor, who had recovered all his\nphlegmatic coolness.\n\nJoe was almost naked. His bleeding arms, his body covered with cuts and\nbruises, told what his sufferings had been. The doctor quietly dressed\nhis wounds, and laid him comfortably under the awning.\n\nJoe soon returned to consciousness, and asked for a glass of brandy,\nwhich the doctor did not see fit to refuse, as the faithful fellow had\nto be indulged.\n\nAfter he had swallowed the stimulant, Joe grasped the hands of his two\nfriends and announced that he was ready to relate what had happened to\nhim.\n\nBut they would not allow him to talk at that time, and he sank back into\na profound sleep, of which he seemed to have the greatest possible need.\n\nThe Victoria was then taking an oblique line to the westward. Driven\nby a tempestuous wind, it again approached the borders of the thorny\ndesert, which the travellers descried over the tops of palm-trees, bent\nand broken by the storm; and, after having made a run of two hundred\nmiles since rescuing Joe, it passed the tenth degree of east longitude\nabout nightfall.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SEVENTH.\n\nThe Western Route.--Joe wakes up.--His Obstinacy.--End of Joe's\nNarrative.--Tagelei.--Kennedy's Anxieties.--The Route to the North.--A\nNight near Aghades.\n\nDuring the night the wind lulled as though reposing after the\nboisterousness of the day, and the Victoria remained quietly at the top\nof the tall sycamore. The doctor and Kennedy kept watch by turns, and\nJoe availed himself of the chance to sleep most sturdily for twenty-four\nhours at a stretch.\n\n\"That's the remedy he needs,\" said Dr. Ferguson. \"Nature will take\ncharge of his care.\"\n\nWith the dawn the wind sprang up again in quite strong, and moreover\ncapricious gusts. It shifted abruptly from south to north, but finally\nthe Victoria was carried away by it toward the west.\n\nThe doctor, map in hand, recognized the kingdom of Damerghou, an\nundulating region of great fertility, in which the huts that compose the\nvillages are constructed of long reeds interwoven with branches of the\nasclepia. The grain-mills were seen raised in the cultivated fields,\nupon small scaffoldings or platforms, to keep them out of the reach of\nthe mice and the huge ants of that country.\n\nThey soon passed the town of Zinder, recognized by its spacious place\nof execution, in the centre of which stands the \"tree of death.\" At\nits foot the executioner stands waiting, and whoever passes beneath its\nshadow is immediately hung!\n\nUpon consulting his compass, Kennedy could not refrain from saying:\n\n\"Look! we are again moving northward.\"\n\n\"No matter; if it only takes us to Timbuctoo, we shall not complain.\nNever was a finer voyage accomplished under better circumstances!\"\n\n\"Nor in better health,\" said Joe, at that instant thrusting his jolly\ncountenance from between the curtains of the awning.\n\n\"There he is! there's our gallant friend--our preserver!\" exclaimed\nKennedy, cordially.--\"How goes it, Joe?\"\n\n\"Oh! why, naturally enough, Mr. Kennedy, very naturally! I never felt\nbetter in my life! Nothing sets a man up like a little pleasure-trip\nwith a bath in Lake Tchad to start on--eh, doctor?\"\n\n\"Brave fellow!\" said Ferguson, pressing Joe's hand, \"what terrible\nanxiety you caused us!\"\n\n\"Humph! and you, sir? Do you think that I felt easy in my mind about\nyou, gentlemen? You gave me a fine fright, let me tell you!\"\n\n\"We shall never agree in the world, Joe, if you take things in that\nstyle.\"\n\n\"I see that his tumble hasn't changed him a bit,\" added Kennedy.\n\n\"Your devotion and self-forgetfulness were sublime, my brave lad, and\nthey saved us, for the Victoria was falling into the lake, and, once\nthere, nobody could have extricated her.\"\n\n\"But, if my devotion, as you are pleased to call my summerset, saved\nyou, did it not save me too, for here we are, all three of us, in\nfirst-rate health? Consequently we have nothing to squabble about in the\nwhole affair.\"\n\n\"Oh! we can never come to a settlement with that youth,\" said the\nsportsman.\n\n\"The best way to settle it,\" replied Joe, \"is to say nothing more about\nthe matter. What's done is done. Good or bad, we can't take it back.\"\n\n\"You obstinate fellow!\" said the doctor, laughing; \"you can't refuse,\nthough, to tell us your adventures, at all events.\"\n\n\"Not if you think it worth while. But, in the first place, I'm going to\ncook this fat goose to a turn, for I see that Mr. Kennedy has not wasted\nhis time.\"\n\n\"All right, Joe!\"\n\n\"Well, let us see then how this African game will sit on a European\nstomach!\"\n\nThe goose was soon roasted by the flame of the blow-pipe, and not long\nafterward was comfortably stowed away. Joe took his own good share,\nlike a man who had eaten nothing for several days. After the tea and the\npunch, he acquainted his friends with his recent adventures. He\nspoke with some emotion, even while looking at things with his usual\nphilosophy. The doctor could not refrain from frequently pressing his\nhand when he saw his worthy servant more considerate of his master's\nsafety than of his own, and, in relation to the sinking of the island\nof the Biddiomahs, he explained to him the frequency of this phenomenon\nupon Lake Tchad.\n\nAt length Joe, continuing his recital, arrived at the point where,\nsinking in the swamp, he had uttered a last cry of despair.\n\n\"I thought I was gone,\" said he, \"and as you came right into my mind, I\nmade a hard fight for it. How, I couldn't tell you--but I'd made up my\nmind that I wouldn't go under without knowing why. Just then, I saw--two\nor three feet from me--what do you think? the end of a rope that had\nbeen fresh cut; so I took leave to make another jerk, and, by hook or\nby crook, I got to the rope. When I pulled, it didn't give; so I pulled\nagain and hauled away and there I was on dry ground! At the end of\nthe rope, I found an anchor! Ah, master, I've a right to call that the\nanchor of safety, anyhow, if you have no objection. I knew it again! It\nwas the anchor of the Victoria! You had grounded there! So I followed\nthe direction of the rope and that gave me your direction, and, after\ntrying hard a few times more, I got out of the swamp. I had got my\nstrength back with my spunk, and I walked on part of the night away\nfrom the lake, until I got to the edge of a very big wood. There I saw a\nfenced-in place, where some horses were grazing, without thinking of any\nharm. Now, there are times when everybody knows how to ride a horse, are\nthere not, doctor? So I didn't spend much time thinking about it, but\njumped right on the back of one of those innocent animals and away we\nwent galloping north as fast as our legs could carry us. I needn't tell\nyou about the towns that I didn't see nor the villages that I took\ngood care to go around. No! I crossed the ploughed fields; I leaped\nthe hedges; I scrambled over the fences; I dug my heels into my nag; I\nthrashed him; I fairly lifted the poor fellow off his feet! At last I\ngot to the end of the tilled land. Good! There was the desert. 'That\nsuits me!' said I, 'for I can see better ahead of me and farther too.' I\nwas hoping all the time to see the balloon tacking about and waiting for\nme. But not a bit of it; and so, in about three hours, I go plump, like\na fool, into a camp of Arabs! Whew! what a hunt that was! You see, Mr.\nKennedy, a hunter don't know what a real hunt is until he's been hunted\nhimself! Still I advise him not to try it if he can keep out of it! My\nhorse was so tired, he was ready to drop off his legs; they were close\non me; I threw myself to the ground; then I jumped up again behind an\nArab! I didn't mean the fellow any harm, and I hope he has no grudge\nagainst me for choking him, but I saw you--and you know the rest.\nThe Victoria came on at my heels, and you caught me up flying, as\na circus-rider does a ring. Wasn't I right in counting on you? Now,\ndoctor, you see how simple all that was! Nothing more natural in the\nworld! I'm ready to begin over again, if it would be of any service\nto you. And besides, master, as I said a while ago, it's not worth\nmentioning.\"\n\n\"My noble, gallant Joe!\" said the doctor, with great feeling. \"Heart of\ngold! we were not astray in trusting to your intelligence and skill.\"\n\n\"Poh! doctor, one has only just to follow things along as they happen,\nand he can always work his way out of a scrape! The safest plan, you\nsee, is to take matters as they come.\"\n\nWhile Joe was telling his experience, the balloon had rapidly passed\nover a long reach of country, and Kennedy soon pointed out on the\nhorizon a collection of structures that looked like a town. The doctor\nglanced at his map and recognized the place as the large village of\nTagelei, in the Damerghou country.\n\n\"Here,\" said he, \"we come upon Dr. Barth's route. It was at this place\nthat he parted from his companions, Richardson and Overweg; the first\nwas to follow the Zinder route, and the second that of Maradi; and you\nmay remember that, of these three travellers, Barth was the only one who\never returned to Europe.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Kennedy, following out on the map the direction of the\nVictoria, \"we are going due north.\"\n\n\"Due north, Dick.\"\n\n\"And don't that give you a little uneasiness?\"\n\n\"Why should it?\"\n\n\"Because that line leads to Tripoli, and over the Great Desert.\"\n\n\"Oh, we shall not go so far as that, my friend--at least, I hope not.\"\n\n\"But where do you expect to halt?\"\n\n\"Come, Dick, don't you feel some curiosity to see Timbuctoo?\"\n\n\"Timbuctoo?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Joe; \"nobody nowadays can think of making the trip to\nAfrica without going to see Timbuctoo.\"\n\n\"You will be only the fifth or sixth European who has ever set eyes on\nthat mysterious city.\"\n\n\"Ho, then, for Timbuctoo!\"\n\n\"Well, then, let us try to get as far as between the seventeenth and\neighteenth degrees of north latitude, and there we will seek a favorable\nwind to carry us westward.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said the hunter. \"But have we still far to go to the northward?\"\n\n\"One hundred and fifty miles at least.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Kennedy, \"I'll turn in and sleep a bit.\"\n\n\"Sleep, sir; sleep!\" urged Joe. \"And you, doctor, do the same yourself:\nyou must have need of rest, for I made you keep watch a little out of\ntime.\"\n\nThe sportsman stretched himself under the awning; but Ferguson, who was\nnot easily conquered by fatigue, remained at his post.\n\nIn about three hours the Victoria was crossing with extreme rapidity\nan expanse of stony country, with ranges of lofty, naked mountains of\ngranitic formation at the base. A few isolated peaks attained the height\nof even four thousand feet. Giraffes, antelopes, and ostriches were seen\nrunning and bounding with marvellous agility in the midst of forests of\nacacias, mimosas, souahs, and date-trees. After the barrenness of the\ndesert, vegetation was now resuming its empire. This was the country of\nthe Kailouas, who veil their faces with a bandage of cotton, like their\ndangerous neighbors, the Touaregs.\n\nAt ten o'clock in the evening, after a splendid trip of two hundred and\nfifty miles, the Victoria halted over an important town. The moonlight\nrevealed glimpses of one district half in ruins; and some pinnacles of\nmosques and minarets shot up here and there, glistening in the silvery\nrays. The doctor took a stellar observation, and discovered that he was\nin the latitude of Aghades.\n\nThis city, once the seat of an immense trade, was already falling into\nruin when Dr. Barth visited it.\n\nThe Victoria, not being seen in the obscurity of night, descended about\ntwo miles above Aghades, in a field of millet. The night was calm, and\nbegan to break into dawn about three o'clock A.M.; while a light wind\ncoaxed the balloon westward, and even a little toward the south.\n\nDr. Ferguson hastened to avail himself of such good fortune, and rapidly\nascending resumed his aerial journey amid a long wake of golden morning\nsunshine.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHTH.\n\nA Rapid Passage.--Prudent Resolves.--Caravans in Sight.--Incessant\nRains.--Goa.--The Niger.--Golberry, Geoffroy, and Gray.--Mungo\nPark.--Laing.--Rene Caillie.--Clapperton.--John and Richard Lander.\n\nThe 17th of May passed tranquilly, without any remarkable incident; the\ndesert gained upon them once more; a moderate wind bore the Victoria\ntoward the southwest, and she never swerved to the right or to the left,\nbut her shadow traced a perfectly straight line on the sand.\n\nBefore starting, the doctor had prudently renewed his stock of water,\nhaving feared that he should not be able to touch ground in these\nregions, infested as they are by the Aouelim-Minian Touaregs. The\nplateau, at an elevation of eighteen hundred feet above the level of the\nsea, sloped down toward the south. Our travellers, having crossed\nthe Aghades route at Murzouk--a route often pressed by the feet of\ncamels--arrived that evening, in the sixteenth degree of north latitude,\nand four degrees fifty-five minutes east longitude, after having\npassed over one hundred and eighty miles of a long and monotonous day's\njourney.\n\nDuring the day Joe dressed the last pieces of game, which had been only\nhastily prepared, and he served up for supper a mess of snipe, that were\ngreatly relished. The wind continuing good, the doctor resolved to keep\non during the night, the moon, still nearly at the full, illumining it\nwith her radiance. The Victoria ascended to a height of five hundred\nfeet, and, during her nocturnal trip of about sixty miles, the gentle\nslumbers of an infant would not have been disturbed by her motion.\n\nOn Sunday morning, the direction of the wind again changed, and it bore\nto the northwestward. A few crows were seen sweeping through the\nair, and, off on the horizon, a flock of vultures which, fortunately,\nhowever, kept at a distance.\n\nThe sight of these birds led Joe to compliment his master on the idea of\nhaving two balloons.\n\n\"Where would we be,\" said he, \"with only one balloon? The second balloon\nis like the life-boat to a ship; in case of wreck we could always take\nto it and escape.\"\n\n\"You are right, friend Joe,\" said the doctor, \"only that my life-boat\ngives me some uneasiness. It is not so good as the main craft.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that, doctor?\" asked Kennedy.\n\n\"I mean to say that the new Victoria is not so good as the old one.\nWhether it be that the stuff it is made of is too much worn, or that the\nheat of the spiral has melted the gutta-percha, I can observe a\ncertain loss of gas. It don't amount to much thus far, but still it\nis noticeable. We have a tendency to sink, and, in order to keep our\nelevation, I am compelled to give greater dilation to the hydrogen.\"\n\n\"The deuce!\" exclaimed Kennedy with concern; \"I see no remedy for that.\"\n\n\"There is none, Dick, and that is why we must hasten our progress, and\neven avoid night halts.\"\n\n\"Are we still far from the coast?\" asked Joe.\n\n\"Which coast, my boy? How are we to know whither chance will carry us?\nAll that I can say is, that Timbuctoo is still about four hundred miles\nto the westward.\n\n\"And how long will it take us to get there?\"\n\n\"Should the wind not carry us too far out of the way, I hope to reach\nthat city by Tuesday evening.\"\n\n\"Then,\" remarked Joe, pointing to a long file of animals and men\nwinding across the open desert, \"we shall arrive there sooner than that\ncaravan.\"\n\nFerguson and Kennedy leaned over and saw an immense cavalcade. There\nwere at least one hundred and fifty camels of the kind that, for twelve\nmutkals of gold, or about twenty-five dollars, go from Timbuctoo to\nTafilet with a load of five hundred pounds upon their backs. Each animal\nhad dangling to its tail a bag to receive its excrement, the only fuel\non which the caravans can depend when crossing the desert.\n\nThese Touareg camels are of the very best race. They can go from three\nto seven days without drinking, and for two without eating. Their speed\nsurpasses that of the horse, and they obey with intelligence the voice\nof the khabir, or guide of the caravan. They are known in the country\nunder the name of mehari.\n\nSuch were the details given by the doctor while his companions continued\nto gaze upon that multitude of men, women, and children, advancing\non foot and with difficulty over a waste of sand half in motion, and\nscarcely kept in its place by scanty nettles, withered grass, and\nstunted bushes that grew upon it. The wind obliterated the marks of\ntheir feet almost instantly.\n\nJoe inquired how the Arabs managed to guide themselves across the\ndesert, and come to the few wells scattered far between throughout this\nvast solitude.\n\n\"The Arabs,\" replied Dr. Ferguson, \"are endowed by nature with a\nwonderful instinct in finding their way. Where a European would be at\na loss, they never hesitate for a moment. An insignificant fragment of\nrock, a pebble, a tuft of grass, a different shade of color in the sand,\nsuffice to guide them with accuracy. During the night they go by the\npolar star. They never travel more than two miles per hour, and always\nrest during the noonday heat. You may judge from that how long it takes\nthem to cross Sahara, a desert more than nine hundred miles in breadth.\"\n\nBut the Victoria had already disappeared from the astonished gaze of the\nArabs, who must have envied her rapidity. That evening she passed two\ndegrees twenty minutes east longitude, and during the night left another\ndegree behind her.\n\nOn Monday the weather changed completely. Rain began to fall with\nextreme violence, and not only had the balloon to resist the power of\nthis deluge, but also the increase of weight which it caused by wetting\nthe whole machine, car and all. This continuous shower accounted for\nthe swamps and marshes that formed the sole surface of the country.\nVegetation reappeared, however, along with the mimosas, the baobabs, and\nthe tamarind-trees.\n\nSuch was the Sonray country, with its villages topped with roofs turned\nover like Armenian caps. There were few mountains, and only such hills\nas were enough to form the ravines and pools where the pintadoes and\nsnipes went sailing and diving through. Here and there, an impetuous\ntorrent cut the roads, and had to be crossed by the natives on long\nvines stretched from tree to tree. The forests gave place to jungles,\nwhich alligators, hippopotami, and the rhinoceros, made their haunts.\n\n\"It will not be long before we see the Niger,\" said the doctor. \"The\nface of the country always changes in the vicinity of large rivers.\nThese moving highways, as they are sometimes correctly called,\nhave first brought vegetation with them, as they will at last bring\ncivilization. Thus, in its course of twenty-five hundred miles, the\nNiger has scattered along its banks the most important cities of\nAfrica.\"\n\n\"By-the-way,\" put in Joe, \"that reminds me of what was said by an\nadmirer of the goodness of Providence, who praised the foresight with\nwhich it had generally caused rivers to flow close to large cities!\"\n\nAt noon the Victoria was passing over a petty town, a mere assemblage of\nmiserable huts, which once was Goa, a great capital.\n\n\"It was there,\" said the doctor, \"that Barth crossed the Niger, on his\nreturn from Timbuctoo. This is the river so famous in antiquity, the\nrival of the Nile, to which pagan superstition ascribed a celestial\norigin. Like the Nile, it has engaged the attention of geographers in\nall ages; and like it, also, its exploration has cost the lives of many\nvictims; yes, even more of them than perished on account of the other.\"\n\nThe Niger flowed broadly between its banks, and its waters rolled\nsouthward with some violence of current; but our travellers, borne\nswiftly by as they were, could scarcely catch a glimpse of its curious\noutline.\n\n\"I wanted to talk to you about this river,\" said Dr. Ferguson, \"and it\nis already far from us. Under the names of Dhiouleba, Mayo, Egghirreou,\nQuorra, and other titles besides, it traverses an immense extent of\ncountry, and almost competes in length with the Nile. These appellations\nsignify simply 'the River,' according to the dialects of the countries\nthrough which it passes.\"\n\n\"Did Dr. Barth follow this route?\" asked Kennedy.\n\n\"No, Dick: in quitting Lake Tchad, he passed through the different towns\nof Bornou, and intersected the Niger at Say, four degrees below Goa;\nthen he penetrated to the bosom of those unexplored countries which the\nNiger embraces in its elbow; and, after eight months of fresh fatigues,\nhe arrived at Timbuctoo; all of which we may do in about three days with\nas swift a wind as this.\"\n\n\"Have the sources of the Niger been discovered?\" asked Joe.\n\n\"Long since,\" replied the doctor. \"The exploration of the Niger and\nits tributaries was the object of several expeditions, the principal\nof which I shall mention: Between 1749 and 1758, Adamson made a\nreconnoissance of the river, and visited Gorea; from 1785 to 1788,\nGolberry and Geoffroy travelled across the deserts of Senegambia, and\nascended as far as the country of the Moors, who assassinated Saugnier,\nBrisson, Adam, Riley, Cochelet, and so many other unfortunate men. Then\ncame the illustrious Mungo Park, the friend of Sir Walter Scott, and,\nlike him, a Scotchman by birth. Sent out in 1795 by the African Society\nof London, he got as far as Bambarra, saw the Niger, travelled five\nhundred miles with a slave-merchant, reconnoitred the Gambia River, and\nreturned to England in 1797. He again set out, on the 30th of January,\n1805, with his brother-in-law Anderson, Scott, the designer, and a gang\nof workmen; he reached Gorea, there added a detachment of thirty-five\nsoldiers to his party, and saw the Niger again on the 19th of August.\nBut, by that time, in consequence of fatigue, privations, ill-usage, the\ninclemencies of the weather, and the unhealthiness of the country, only\neleven persons remained alive of the forty Europeans in the party. On\nthe 16th of November, the last letters from Mungo Park reached his wife;\nand, a year later a trader from that country gave information that,\nhaving got as far as Boussa, on the Niger, on the 23d of December, the\nunfortunate traveller's boat was upset by the cataracts in that part of\nthe river, and he was murdered by the natives.\"\n\n\"And his dreadful fate did not check the efforts of others to explore\nthat river?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, Dick. Since then, there were two objects in view:\nnamely, to recover the lost man's papers, as well as to pursue the\nexploration. In 1816, an expedition was organized, in which Major\nGrey took part. It arrived in Senegal, penetrated to the Fonta-Jallon,\nvisited the Foullah and Mandingo populations, and returned to England\nwithout further results. In 1822, Major Laing explored all the western\npart of Africa near to the British possessions; and he it was who got\nso far as the sources of the Niger; and, according to his documents, the\nspring in which that immense river takes its rise is not two feet broad.\n\n\"Easy to jump over,\" said Joe.\n\n\"How's that? Easy you think, eh?\" retorted the doctor. \"If we are to\nbelieve tradition, whoever attempts to pass that spring, by leaping over\nit, is immediately swallowed up; and whoever tries to draw water from\nit, feels himself repulsed by an invisible hand.\"\n\n\"I suppose a man has a right not to believe a word of that!\" persisted\nJoe.\n\n\"Oh, by all means!--Five years later, it was Major Laing's destiny to\nforce his way across the desert of Sahara, penetrate to Timbuctoo,\nand perish a few miles above it, by strangling, at the hands of the\nOuelad-shiman, who wanted to compel him to turn Mussulman.\"\n\n\"Still another victim!\" said the sportsman.\n\n\"It was then that a brave young man, with his own feeble resources,\nundertook and accomplished the most astonishing of modern journeys--I\nmean the Frenchman Rene Caillie, who, after sundry attempts in 1819 and\n1824, set out again on the 19th of April, 1827, from Rio Nunez. On the\n3d of August he arrived at Time, so thoroughly exhausted and ill that he\ncould not resume his journey until six months later, in January, 1828.\nHe then joined a caravan, and, protected by his Oriental dress, reached\nthe Niger on the 10th of March, penetrated to the city of Jenne,\nembarked on the river, and descended it, as far as Timbuctoo, where\nhe arrived on the 30th of April. In 1760, another Frenchman, Imbert by\nname, and, in 1810, an Englishman, Robert Adams, had seen this curious\nplace; but Rene Caillie was to be the first European who could bring\nback any authentic data concerning it. On the 4th of May he quitted this\n'Queen of the desert;' on the 9th, he surveyed the very spot where Major\nLaing had been murdered; on the 19th, he arrived at El-Arouan, and left\nthat commercial town to brave a thousand dangers in crossing the vast\nsolitudes comprised between the Soudan and the northern regions of\nAfrica. At length he entered Tangiers, and on the 28th of September\nsailed for Toulon. In nineteen months, notwithstanding one hundred and\neighty days' sickness, he had traversed Africa from west to north. Ah!\nhad Callie been born in England, he would have been honored as the most\nintrepid traveller of modern times, as was the case with Mungo Park. But\nin France he was not appreciated according to his worth.\"\n\n\"He was a sturdy fellow!\" said Kennedy, \"but what became of him?\"\n\n\"He died at the age of thirty-nine, from the consequences of his long\nfatigues. They thought they had done enough in decreeing him the prize\nof the Geographical Society in 1828; the highest honors would have been\npaid to him in England.\n\n\"While he was accomplishing this remarkable journey, an Englishman had\nconceived a similar enterprise and was trying to push it through\nwith equal courage, if not with equal good fortune. This was Captain\nClapperton, the companion of Denham. In 1829 he reentered Africa by the\nwestern coast of the Gulf of Benin; he then followed in the track of\nMungo Park and of Laing, recovered at Boussa the documents relative to\nthe death of the former, and arrived on the 20th of August at Sackatoo,\nwhere he was seized and held as a prisoner, until he expired in the arms\nof his faithful attendant Richard Lander.\"\n\n\"And what became of this Lander?\" asked Joe, deeply interested.\n\n\"He succeeded in regaining the coast and returned to London, bringing\nwith him the captain's papers, and an exact narrative of his own\njourney. He then offered his services to the government to complete\nthe reconnoissance of the Niger. He took with him his brother John, the\nsecond child of a poor couple in Cornwall, and, together, these men,\nbetween 1829 and 1831, redescended the river from Boussa to its mouth,\ndescribing it village by village, mile by mile.\"\n\n\"So both the brothers escaped the common fate?\" queried Kennedy.\n\n\"Yes, on this expedition, at least; but in 1833 Richard undertook a\nthird trip to the Niger, and perished by a bullet, near the mouth of the\nriver. You see, then, my friends, that the country over which we are\nnow passing has witnessed some noble instances of self-sacrifice which,\nunfortunately, have only too often had death for their reward.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-NINTH.\n\nThe Country in the Elbow of the Niger.--A Fantastic View of the Hombori\nMountains.--Kabra.--Timbuctoo.--The Chart of Dr. Barth.--A Decaying\nCity.--Whither Heaven wills.\n\nDuring this dull Monday, Dr. Ferguson diverted his thoughts by giving\nhis companions a thousand details concerning the country they were\ncrossing. The surface, which was quite flat, offered no impediment\nto their progress. The doctor's sole anxiety arose from the obstinate\nnortheast wind which continued to blow furiously, and bore them away\nfrom the latitude of Timbuctoo.\n\nThe Niger, after running northward as far as that city, sweeps around,\nlike an immense water-jet from some fountain, and falls into the\nAtlantic in a broad sheaf. In the elbow thus formed the country is of\nvaried character, sometimes luxuriantly fertile, and sometimes extremely\nbare; fields of maize succeeded by wide spaces covered with broom-corn\nand uncultivated plains. All kinds of aquatic birds--pelicans,\nwild-duck, kingfishers, and the rest--were seen in numerous flocks\nhovering about the borders of the pools and torrents.\n\nFrom time to time there appeared an encampment of Touaregs, the men\nsheltered under their leather tents, while their women were busied\nwith the domestic toil outside, milking their camels and smoking their\nhuge-bowled pipes.\n\nBy eight o'clock in the evening the Victoria had advanced more than two\nhundred miles to the westward, and our aeronauts became the spectators\nof a magnificent scene.\n\nA mass of moonbeams forcing their way through an opening in the clouds,\nand gliding between the long lines of falling rain, descended in a\ngolden shower on the ridges of the Hombori Mountains. Nothing could be\nmore weird than the appearance of these seemingly basaltic summits; they\nstood out in fantastic profile against the sombre sky, and the beholder\nmight have fancied them to be the legendary ruins of some vast city of\nthe middle ages, such as the icebergs of the polar seas sometimes mimic\nthem in nights of gloom.\n\n\"An admirable landscape for the 'Mysteries of Udolpho'!\" exclaimed the\ndoctor. \"Ann Radcliffe could not have depicted yon mountains in a more\nappalling aspect.\"\n\n\"Faith!\" said Joe, \"I wouldn't like to be strolling alone in the evening\nthrough this country of ghosts. Do you see now, master, if it wasn't so\nheavy, I'd like to carry that whole landscape home to Scotland! It would\ndo for the borders of Loch Lomond, and tourists would rush there in\ncrowds.\"\n\n\"Our balloon is hardly large enough to admit of that little\nexperiment--but I think our direction is changing. Bravo!--the elves\nand fairies of the place are quite obliging. See, they've sent us a nice\nlittle southeast breeze, that will put us on the right track again.\"\n\nIn fact, the Victoria was resuming a more northerly route, and on the\nmorning of the 20th she was passing over an inextricable network of\nchannels, torrents, and streams, in fine, the whole complicated tangle\nof the Niger's tributaries. Many of these channels, covered with a thick\ngrowth of herbage, resembled luxuriant meadow-lands. There the doctor\nrecognized the route followed by the explorer Barth when he launched\nupon the river to descend to Timbuctoo. Eight hundred fathoms broad at\nthis point, the Niger flowed between banks richly grown with cruciferous\nplants and tamarind-trees. Herds of agile gazelles were seen skipping\nabout, their curling horns mingling with the tall herbage, within\nwhich the alligator, half concealed, lay silently in wait for them with\nwatchful eyes.\n\nLong files of camels and asses laden with merchandise from Jenne were\nwinding in under the noble trees. Ere long, an amphitheatre of low-built\nhouses was discovered at a turn of the river, their roofs and terraces\nheaped up with hay and straw gathered from the neighboring districts.\n\n\"There's Kabra!\" exclaimed the doctor, joyously; \"there is the harbor of\nTimbuctoo, and the city is not five miles from here!\"\n\n\"Then, sir, you are satisfied?\" half queried Joe.\n\n\"Delighted, my boy!\"\n\n\"Very good; then every thing's for the best!\"\n\nIn fact, about two o'clock, the Queen of the Desert, mysterious\nTimbuctoo, which once, like Athens and Rome, had her schools of learned\nmen, and her professorships of philosophy, stretched away before the\ngaze of our travellers.\n\nFerguson followed the most minute details upon the chart traced by Barth\nhimself, and was enabled to recognize its perfect accuracy.\n\nThe city forms an immense triangle marked out upon a vast plain of white\nsand, its acute angle directed toward the north and piercing a corner of\nthe desert. In the environs there was almost nothing, hardly even a few\ngrasses, with some dwarf mimosas and stunted bushes.\n\nAs for the appearance of Timbuctoo, the reader has but to imagine a\ncollection of billiard-balls and thimbles--such is the bird's-eye view!\nThe streets, which are quite narrow, are lined with houses only one\nstory in height, built of bricks dried in the sun, and huts of straw\nand reeds, the former square, the latter conical. Upon the terraces were\nseen some of the male inhabitants, carelessly lounging at full length\nin flowing apparel of bright colors, and lance or musket in hand; but no\nwomen were visible at that hour of the day.\n\n\"Yet they are said to be handsome,\" remarked the doctor. \"You see the\nthree towers of the three mosques that are the only ones left standing\nof a great number--the city has indeed fallen from its ancient splendor!\nAt the top of the triangle rises the Mosque of Sankore, with its ranges\nof galleries resting on arcades of sufficiently pure design. Farther on,\nand near to the Sane-Gungu quarter, is the Mosque of Sidi-Yahia and some\ntwo-story houses. But do not look for either palaces or monuments:\nthe sheik is a mere son of traffic, and his royal palace is a\ncounting-house.\"\n\n\"It seems to me that I can see half-ruined ramparts,\" said Kennedy.\n\n\"They were destroyed by the Fouillanes in 1826; the city was one-third\nlarger then, for Timbuctoo, an object generally coveted by all the\ntribes, since the eleventh century, has belonged in succession to the\nTouaregs, the Sonrayans, the Morocco men, and the Fouillanes; and this\ngreat centre of civilization, where a sage like Ahmed-Baba owned, in\nthe sixteenth century, a library of sixteen hundred manuscripts, is now\nnothing but a mere half-way house for the trade of Central Africa.\"\n\nThe city, indeed, seemed abandoned to supreme neglect; it betrayed that\nindifference which seems epidemic to cities that are passing away. Huge\nheaps of rubbish encumbered the suburbs, and, with the hill on which the\nmarket-place stood, formed the only inequalities of the ground.\n\nWhen the Victoria passed, there was some slight show of movement; drums\nwere beaten; but the last learned man still lingering in the place had\nhardly time to notice the new phenomenon, for our travellers, driven\nonward by the wind of the desert, resumed the winding course of the\nriver, and, ere long, Timbuctoo was nothing more than one of the\nfleeting reminiscences of their journey.\n\n\"And now,\" said the doctor, \"Heaven may waft us whither it pleases!\"\n\n\"Provided only that we go westward,\" added Kennedy.\n\n\"Bah!\" said Joe; \"I wouldn't be afraid if it was to go back to Zanzibar\nby the same road, or to cross the ocean to America.\"\n\n\"We would first have to be able to do that, Joe!\"\n\n\"And what's wanting, doctor?\"\n\n\"Gas, my boy; the ascending force of the balloon is evidently growing\nweaker, and we shall need all our management to make it carry us to\nthe sea-coast. I shall even have to throw over some ballast. We are too\nheavy.\"\n\n\"That's what comes of doing nothing, doctor; when a man lies stretched\nout all day long in his hammock, he gets fat and heavy. It's a lazybones\ntrip, this of ours, master, and when we get back every body will find us\nbig and stout.\"\n\n\"Just like Joe,\" said Kennedy; \"just the ideas for him: but wait a bit!\nCan you tell what we may have to go through yet? We are still far from\nthe end of our trip. Where do you expect to strike the African coast,\ndoctor?\"\n\n\"I should find it hard to answer you, Kennedy. We are at the mercy of\nvery variable winds; but I should think myself fortunate were we to\nstrike it between Sierra Leone and Portendick. There is a stretch of\ncountry in that quarter where we should meet with friends.\"\n\n\"And it would be a pleasure to press their hands; but, are we going in\nthe desirable direction?\"\n\n\"Not any too well, Dick; not any too well! Look at the needle of the\ncompass; we are bearing southward, and ascending the Niger toward its\nsources.\"\n\n\"A fine chance to discover them,\" said Joe, \"if they were not known\nalready. Now, couldn't we just find others for it, on a pinch?\"\n\n\"Not exactly, Joe; but don't be alarmed: I hardly expect to go so far as\nthat.\"\n\nAt nightfall the doctor threw out the last bags of sand. The Victoria\nrose higher, and the blow-pipe, although working at full blast, could\nscarcely keep her up. At that time she was sixty miles to the southward\nof Timbuctoo, and in the morning the aeronauts awoke over the banks of\nthe Niger, not far from Lake Debo.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FORTIETH.\n\nDr. Ferguson's Anxieties.--Persistent Movement southward.--A Cloud\nof Grasshoppers.--A View of Jenne.--A View of Sego.--Change of the\nWind.--Joe's Regrets.\n\nThe flow of the river was, at that point, divided by large islands into\nnarrow branches, with a very rapid current. Upon one among them stood\nsome shepherds' huts, but it had become impossible to take an exact\nobservation of them, because the speed of the balloon was constantly\nincreasing. Unfortunately, it turned still more toward the south, and in\na few moments crossed Lake Debo.\n\nDr. Ferguson, forcing the dilation of his aerial craft to the utmost,\nsought for other currents of air at different heights, but in vain; and\nhe soon gave up the attempt, which was only augmenting the waste of gas\nby pressing it against the well-worn tissue of the balloon.\n\nHe made no remark, but he began to feel very anxious. This persistence\nof the wind to head him off toward the southern part of Africa was\ndefeating his calculations, and he no longer knew upon whom or upon what\nto depend. Should he not reach the English or French territories, what\nwas to become of him in the midst of the barbarous tribes that infest\nthe coasts of Guinea? How should he there get to a ship to take him back\nto England? And the actual direction of the wind was driving him along\nto the kingdom of Dahomey, among the most savage races, and into the\npower of a ruler who was in the habit of sacrificing thousands of human\nvictims at his public orgies. There he would be lost!\n\nOn the other hand, the balloon was visibly wearing out, and the doctor\nfelt it failing him. However, as the weather was clearing up a little,\nhe hoped that the cessation of the rain would bring about a change in\nthe atmospheric currents.\n\nIt was therefore a disagreeable reminder of the actual situation when\nJoe said aloud:\n\n\"There! the rain's going to pour down harder than ever; and this time it\nwill be the deluge itself, if we're to judge by yon cloud that's coming\nup!\"\n\n\"What! another cloud?\" asked Ferguson.\n\n\"Yes, and a famous one,\" replied Kennedy.\n\n\"I never saw the like of it,\" added Joe.\n\n\"I breathe freely again!\" said the doctor, laying down his spy-glass.\n\"That's not a cloud!\"\n\n\"Not a cloud?\" queried Joe, with surprise.\n\n\"No; it is a swarm.\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"A swarm of grasshoppers!\"\n\n\"That? Grasshoppers!\"\n\n\"Myriads of grasshoppers, that are going to sweep over this country like\na water-spout; and woe to it! for, should these insects alight, it will\nbe laid waste.\"\n\n\"That would be a sight worth beholding!\"\n\n\"Wait a little, Joe. In ten minutes that cloud will have arrived where\nwe are, and you can then judge by the aid of your own eyes.\"\n\nThe doctor was right. The cloud, thick, opaque, and several miles in\nextent, came on with a deafening noise, casting its immense shadow over\nthe fields. It was composed of numberless legions of that species of\ngrasshopper called crickets. About a hundred paces from the balloon,\nthey settled down upon a tract full of foliage and verdure. Fifteen\nminutes later, the mass resumed its flight, and our travellers could,\neven at a distance, see the trees and the bushes entirely stripped, and\nthe fields as bare as though they had been swept with the scythe. One\nwould have thought that a sudden winter had just descended upon the\nearth and struck the region with the most complete sterility.\n\n\"Well, Joe, what do you think of that?\"\n\n\"Well, doctor, it's very curious, but quite natural. What one\ngrasshopper does on a small scale, thousands do on a grand scale.\"\n\n\"It's a terrible shower,\" said the hunter; \"more so than hail itself in\nthe devastation it causes.\"\n\n\"It is impossible to prevent it,\" replied Ferguson. \"Sometimes the\ninhabitants have had the idea to burn the forests, and even the standing\ncrops, in order to arrest the progress of these insects; but the first\nranks plunging into the flames would extinguish them beneath their\nmass, and the rest of the swarm would then pass irresistibly onward.\nFortunately, in these regions, there is some sort of compensation for\ntheir ravages, since the natives gather these insects in great numbers\nand greedily eat them.\"\n\n\"They are the prawns of the air,\" said Joe, who added that he was sorry\nthat he had never had the chance to taste them--just for information's\nsake!\n\nThe country became more marshy toward evening; the forests dwindled to\nisolated clumps of trees; and on the borders of the river could be seen\nplantations of tobacco, and swampy meadow-lands fat with forage. At last\nthe city of Jenne, on a large island, came in sight, with the two\ntowers of its clay-built mosque, and the putrid odor of the millions\nof swallows' nests accumulated in its walls. The tops of some baobabs,\nmimosas, and date-trees peeped up between the houses; and, even at\nnight, the activity of the place seemed very great. Jenne is, in fact,\nquite a commercial city: it supplies all the wants of Timbuctoo. Its\nboats on the river, and its caravans along the shaded roads, bear\nthither the various products of its industry.\n\n\"Were it not that to do so would prolong our journey,\" said the doctor,\n\"I should like to alight at this place. There must be more than one Arab\nthere who has travelled in England and France, and to whom our style of\nlocomotion is not altogether new. But it would not be prudent.\"\n\n\"Let us put off the visit until our next trip,\" said Joe, laughing.\n\n\"Besides, my friends, unless I am mistaken, the wind has a slight\ntendency to veer a little more to the eastward, and we must not lose\nsuch an opportunity.\"\n\nThe doctor threw overboard some articles that were no longer\nof use--some empty bottles, and a case that had contained\npreserved-meat--and thereby managed to keep the balloon in a belt of the\natmosphere more favorable to his plans. At four o'clock in the morning\nthe first rays of the sun lighted up Sego, the capital of Bambarra,\nwhich could be recognized at once by the four towns that compose it,\nby its Saracenic mosques, and by the incessant going and coming of the\nflat-bottomed boats that convey its inhabitants from one quarter to the\nother. But the travellers were not more seen than they saw. They\nsped rapidly and directly to the northwest, and the doctor's anxiety\ngradually subsided.\n\n\"Two more days in this direction, and at this rate of speed, and we'll\nreach the Senegal River.\"\n\n\"And we'll be in a friendly country?\" asked the hunter.\n\n\"Not altogether; but, if the worst came to the worst, and the balloon\nwere to fail us, we might make our way to the French settlements.\nBut, let it hold out only for a few hundred miles, and we shall arrive\nwithout fatigue, alarm, or danger, at the western coast.\"\n\n\"And the thing will be over!\" added Joe. \"Heigh-ho! so much the worse.\nIf it wasn't for the pleasure of telling about it, I would never want\nto set foot on the ground again! Do you think anybody will believe our\nstory, doctor?\"\n\n\"Who can tell, Joe? One thing, however, will be undeniable: a thousand\nwitnesses saw us start on one side of the African Continent, and a\nthousand more will see us arrive on the other.\"\n\n\"And, in that case, it seems to me that it would be hard to say that we\nhad not crossed it,\" added Kennedy.\n\n\"Ah, doctor!\" said Joe again, with a deep sigh, \"I'll think more than\nonce of my lumps of solid gold-ore! There was something that would have\ngiven WEIGHT to our narrative! At a grain of gold per head, I could have\ngot together a nice crowd to listen to me, and even to admire me!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FORTY-FIRST.\n\nThe Approaches to Senegal.--The Balloon sinks lower and lower.--They\nkeep throwing out, throwing out.--The Marabout Al-Hadji.--Messrs.\nPascal, Vincent, and Lambert.--A Rival of Mohammed.--The Difficult\nMountains.--Kennedy's Weapons.--One of Joe's Manoeuvres.--A Halt over a\nForest.\n\nOn the 27th of May, at nine o'clock in the morning, the country\npresented an entirely different aspect. The slopes, extending far away,\nchanged to hills that gave evidence of mountains soon to follow. They\nwould have to cross the chain which separates the basin of the Niger\nfrom the basin of the Senegal, and determines the course of the\nwater-shed, whether to the Gulf of Guinea on the one hand, or to the bay\nof Cape Verde on the other.\n\nAs far as Senegal, this part of Africa is marked down as dangerous.\nDr. Ferguson knew it through the recitals of his predecessors. They had\nsuffered a thousand privations and been exposed to a thousand dangers\nin the midst of these barbarous negro tribes. It was this fatal climate\nthat had devoured most of the companions of Mungo Park. Ferguson,\ntherefore, was more than ever decided not to set foot in this\ninhospitable region.\n\nBut he had not enjoyed one moment of repose. The Victoria was descending\nvery perceptibly, so much so that he had to throw overboard a number\nmore of useless articles, especially when there was a mountain-top to\npass. Things went on thus for more than one hundred and twenty miles;\nthey were worn out with ascending and falling again; the balloon, like\nanother rock of Sisyphus, kept continually sinking back toward the\nground. The rotundity of the covering, which was now but little\ninflated, was collapsing already. It assumed an elongated shape, and the\nwind hollowed large cavities in the silken surface.\n\nKennedy could not help observing this.\n\n\"Is there a crack or a tear in the balloon?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, but the gutta percha has evidently softened or melted in the heat,\nand the hydrogen is escaping through the silk.\"\n\n\"How can we prevent that?\"\n\n\"It is impossible. Let us lighten her. That is the only help. So let us\nthrow out every thing we can spare.\"\n\n\"But what shall it be?\" said the hunter, looking at the car, which was\nalready quite bare.\n\n\"Well, let us get rid of the awning, for its weight is quite\nconsiderable.\"\n\nJoe, who was interested in this order, climbed up on the circle which\nkept together the cordage of the network, and from that place easily\nmanaged to detach the heavy curtains of the awning and throw them\noverboard.\n\n\"There's something that will gladden the hearts of a whole tribe of\nblacks,\" said he; \"there's enough to dress a thousand of them, for\nthey're not very extravagant with cloth.\"\n\nThe balloon had risen a little, but it soon became evident that it was\nagain approaching the ground.\n\n\"Let us alight,\" suggested Kennedy, \"and see what can be done with the\ncovering of the balloon.\"\n\n\"I tell you, again, Dick, that we have no means of repairing it.\"\n\n\"Then what shall we do?\"\n\n\"We'll have to sacrifice every thing not absolutely indispensable; I\nam anxious, at all hazards, to avoid a detention in these regions. The\nforests over the tops of which we are skimming are any thing but safe.\"\n\n\"What! are there lions in them, or hyenas?\" asked Joe, with an\nexpression of sovereign contempt.\n\n\"Worse than that, my boy! There are men, and some of the most cruel,\ntoo, in all Africa.\"\n\n\"How is that known?\"\n\n\"By the statements of travellers who have been here before us. Then\nthe French settlers, who occupy the colony of Senegal, necessarily\nhave relations with the surrounding tribes. Under the administration\nof Colonel Faidherbe, reconnaissances have been pushed far up into the\ncountry. Officers such as Messrs. Pascal, Vincent, and Lambert, have\nbrought back precious documents from their expeditions. They have\nexplored these countries formed by the elbow of the Senegal in places\nwhere war and pillage have left nothing but ruins.\"\n\n\"What, then, took place?\"\n\n\"I will tell you. In 1854 a Marabout of the Senegalese Fouta, Al-Hadji\nby name, declaring himself to be inspired like Mohammed, stirred up\nall the tribes to war against the infidels--that is to say, against\nthe Europeans. He carried destruction and desolation over the regions\nbetween the Senegal River and its tributary, the Fateme. Three hordes\nof fanatics led on by him scoured the country, sparing neither a village\nnor a hut in their pillaging, massacring career. He advanced in person\non the town of Sego, which was a long time threatened. In 1857 he worked\nup farther to the northward, and invested the fortification of Medina,\nbuilt by the French on the bank of the river. This stronghold was\ndefended by Paul Holl, who, for several months, without provisions\nor ammunition, held out until Colonel Faidherbe came to his relief.\nAl-Hadji and his bands then repassed the Senegal, and reappeared in the\nKaarta, continuing their rapine and murder.--Well, here below us is the\nvery country in which he has found refuge with his hordes of banditti;\nand I assure you that it would not be a good thing to fall into his\nhands.\"\n\n\"We shall not,\" said Joe, \"even if we have to throw overboard our\nclothes to save the Victoria.\"\n\n\"We are not far from the river,\" said the doctor, \"but I foresee that\nour balloon will not be able to carry us beyond it.\"\n\n\"Let us reach its banks, at all events,\" said the Scot, \"and that will\nbe so much gained.\"\n\n\"That is what we are trying to do,\" rejoined Ferguson, \"only that one\nthing makes me feel anxious.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"We shall have mountains to pass, and that will be difficult to do,\nsince I cannot augment the ascensional force of the balloon, even with\nthe greatest possible heat that I can produce.\"\n\n\"Well, wait a bit,\" said Kennedy, \"and we shall see!\"\n\n\"The poor Victoria!\" sighed Joe; \"I had got fond of her as the sailor\ndoes of his ship, and I'll not give her up so easily. She may not be\nwhat she was at the start--granted; but we shouldn't say a word against\nher. She has done us good service, and it would break my heart to desert\nher.\"\n\n\"Be at your ease, Joe; if we leave her, it will be in spite of\nourselves. She'll serve us until she's completely worn out, and I ask of\nher only twenty-four hours more!\"\n\n\"Ah, she's getting used up! She grows thinner and thinner,\" said Joe,\ndolefully, while he eyed her. \"Poor balloon!\"\n\n\"Unless I am deceived,\" said Kennedy, \"there on the horizon are the\nmountains of which you were speaking, doctor.\"\n\n\"Yes, there they are, indeed!\" exclaimed the doctor, after having\nexamined them through his spy-glass, \"and they look very high. We shall\nhave some trouble in crossing them.\"\n\n\"Can we not avoid them?\"\n\n\"I am afraid not, Dick. See what an immense space they occupy--nearly\none-half of the horizon!\"\n\n\"They even seem to shut us in,\" added Joe. \"They are gaining on both our\nright and our left.\"\n\n\"We must then pass over them.\"\n\nThese obstacles, which threatened such imminent peril, seemed to\napproach with extreme rapidity, or, to speak more accurately, the wind,\nwhich was very fresh, was hurrying the balloon toward the sharp peaks.\nSo rise it must, or be dashed to pieces.\n\n\"Let us empty our tank of water,\" said the doctor, \"and keep only enough\nfor one day.\"\n\n\"There it goes,\" shouted Joe.\n\n\"Does the balloon rise at all?\" asked Kennedy.\n\n\"A little--some fifty feet,\" replied the doctor, who kept his eyes fixed\non the barometer. \"But that is not enough.\"\n\nIn truth the lofty peaks were starting up so swiftly before the\ntravellers that they seemed to be rushing down upon them. The balloon\nwas far from rising above them. She lacked an elevation of more than\nfive hundred feet more.\n\nThe stock of water for the cylinder was also thrown overboard and only a\nfew pints were retained, but still all this was not enough.\n\n\"We must pass them though!\" urged the doctor.\n\n\"Let us throw out the tanks--we have emptied them.\" said Kennedy.\n\n\"Over with them!\"\n\n\"There they go!\" panted Joe. \"But it's hard to see ourselves dropping\noff this way by piecemeal.\"\n\n\"Now, for your part, Joe, make no attempt to sacrifice yourself as you\ndid the other day! Whatever happens, swear to me that you will not leave\nus!\"\n\n\"Have no fears, my master, we shall not be separated.\"\n\nThe Victoria had ascended some hundred and twenty feet, but the crest\nof the mountain still towered above it. It was an almost perpendicular\nridge that ended in a regular wall rising abruptly in a straight line.\nIt still rose more than two hundred feet over the aeronauts.\n\n\"In ten minutes,\" said the doctor to himself, \"our car will be dashed\nagainst those rocks unless we succeed in passing them!\"\n\n\"Well, doctor?\" queried Joe.\n\n\"Keep nothing but our pemmican, and throw out all the heavy meat.\"\n\nThereupon the balloon was again lightened by some fifty pounds, and it\nrose very perceptibly, but that was of little consequence, unless it got\nabove the line of the mountain-tops. The situation was terrifying. The\nVictoria was rushing on with great rapidity. They could feel that she\nwould be dashed to pieces--that the shock would be fearful.\n\nThe doctor glanced around him in the car. It was nearly empty.\n\n\"If needs be, Dick, hold yourself in readiness to throw over your\nfire-arms!\"\n\n\"Sacrifice my fire-arms?\" repeated the sportsman, with intense feeling.\n\n\"My friend, I ask it; it will be absolutely necessary!\"\n\n\"Samuel! Doctor!\"\n\n\"Your guns, and your stock of powder and ball might cost us our lives.\"\n\n\"We are close to it!\" cried Joe.\n\nSixty feet! The mountain still overtopped the balloon by sixty feet.\n\nJoe took the blankets and other coverings and tossed them out; then,\nwithout a word to Kennedy, he threw over several bags of bullets and\nlead.\n\nThe balloon went up still higher; it surmounted the dangerous ridge, and\nthe rays of the sun shone upon its uppermost extremity; but the car was\nstill below the level of certain broken masses of rock, against which it\nwould inevitably be dashed.\n\n\"Kennedy! Kennedy! throw out your fire-arms, or we are lost!\" shouted\nthe doctor.\n\n\"Wait, sir; wait one moment!\" they heard Joe exclaim, and, looking\naround, they saw Joe disappear over the edge of the balloon.\n\n\"Joe! Joe!\" cried Kennedy.\n\n\"Wretched man!\" was the doctor's agonized expression.\n\nThe flat top of the mountain may have had about twenty feet in breadth\nat this point, and, on the other side, the slope presented a less\ndeclivity. The car just touched the level of this plane, which happened\nto be quite even, and it glided over a soil composed of sharp pebbles\nthat grated as it passed.\n\n\"We're over it! we're over it! we're clear!\" cried out an exulting voice\nthat made Ferguson's heart leap to his throat.\n\nThe daring fellow was there, grasping the lower rim of the car, and\nrunning afoot over the top of the mountain, thus lightening the balloon\nof his whole weight. He had to hold on with all his strength, too, for\nit was likely to escape his grasp at any moment.\n\nWhen he had reached the opposite declivity, and the abyss was before\nhim, Joe, by a vigorous effort, hoisted himself from the ground, and,\nclambering up by the cordage, rejoined his friends.\n\n\"That was all!\" he coolly ejaculated.\n\n\"My brave Joe! my friend!\" said the doctor, with deep emotion.\n\n\"Oh! what I did,\" laughed the other, \"was not for you; it was to save\nMr. Kennedy's rifle. I owed him that good turn for the affair with the\nArab! I like to pay my debts, and now we are even,\" added he, handing\nto the sportsman his favorite weapon. \"I'd feel very badly to see you\ndeprived of it.\"\n\nKennedy heartily shook the brave fellow's hand, without being able to\nutter a word.\n\nThe Victoria had nothing to do now but to descend. That was easy enough,\nso that she was soon at a height of only two hundred feet from the\nground, and was then in equilibrium. The surface seemed very much broken\nas though by a convulsion of nature. It presented numerous inequalities,\nwhich would have been very difficult to avoid during the night with\na balloon that could no longer be controlled. Evening was coming on\nrapidly, and, notwithstanding his repugnance, the doctor had to make up\nhis mind to halt until morning.\n\n\"We'll now look for a favorable stopping-place,\" said he.\n\n\"Ah!\" replied Kennedy, \"you have made up your mind, then, at last?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have for a long time been thinking over a plan which we'll try\nto put into execution; it is only six o'clock in the evening, and we\nshall have time enough. Throw out your anchors, Joe!\"\n\nJoe immediately obeyed, and the two anchors dangled below the balloon.\n\n\"I see large forests ahead of us,\" said the doctor; \"we are going to\nsweep along their tops, and we shall grapple to some tree, for nothing\nwould make me think of passing the night below, on the ground.\"\n\n\"But can we not descend?\" asked Kennedy.\n\n\"To what purpose? I repeat that it would be dangerous for us to\nseparate, and, besides, I claim your help for a difficult piece of\nwork.\"\n\nThe Victoria, which was skimming along the tops of immense forests, soon\ncame to a sharp halt. Her anchors had caught, and, the wind falling as\ndusk came on, she remained motionlessly suspended above a vast field of\nverdure, formed by the tops of a forest of sycamores.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FORTY-SECOND.\n\nA Struggle of Generosity.--The Last Sacrifice.--The Dilating\nApparatus.--Joe's Adroitness.--Midnight.--The Doctor's Watch.--Kennedy's\nWatch.--The Latter falls asleep at his Post.--The Fire.--The Howlings of\nthe Natives.--Out of Range.\n\nDoctor Ferguson's first care was to take his bearings by stellar\nobservation, and he discovered that he was scarcely twenty-five miles\nfrom Senegal.\n\n\"All that we can manage to do, my friends,\" said he, after having\npointed his map, \"is to cross the river; but, as there is neither bridge\nnor boat, we must, at all hazards, cross it with the balloon, and, in\norder to do that, we must still lighten up.\"\n\n\"But I don't exactly see how we can do that?\" replied Kennedy, anxious\nabout his fire-arms, \"unless one of us makes up his mind to sacrifice\nhimself for the rest,--that is, to stay behind, and, in my turn, I claim\nthat honor.\"\n\n\"You, indeed!\" remonstrated Joe; \"ain't I used to--\"\n\n\"The question now is, not to throw ourselves out of the car, but simply\nto reach the coast of Africa on foot. I am a first-rate walker, a good\nsportsman, and--\"\n\n\"I'll never consent to it!\" insisted Joe.\n\n\"Your generous rivalry is useless, my brave friends,\" said Ferguson; \"I\ntrust that we shall not come to any such extremity: besides, if we did,\ninstead of separating, we should keep together, so as to make our way\nacross the country in company.\"\n\n\"That's the talk,\" said Joe; \"a little tramp won't do us any harm.\"\n\n\"But before we try that,\" resumed the doctor, \"we must employ a last\nmeans of lightening the balloon.\"\n\n\"What will that be? I should like to see it,\" said Kennedy,\nincredulously.\n\n\"We must get rid of the cylinder-chests, the spiral, and the Buntzen\nbattery. Nine hundred pounds make a rather heavy load to carry through\nthe air.\"\n\n\"But then, Samuel, how will you dilate your gas?\"\n\n\"I shall not do so at all. We'll have to get along without it.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Listen, my friends: I have calculated very exactly the amount of\nascensional force left to us, and it is sufficient to carry us every\none with the few objects that remain. We shall make in all a weight of\nhardly five hundred pounds, including the two anchors which I desire to\nkeep.\"\n\n\"Dear doctor, you know more about the matter than we do; you are the\nsole judge of the situation. Tell us what we ought to do, and we will do\nit.\"\n\n\"I am at your orders, master,\" added Joe.\n\n\"I repeat, my friends, that however serious the decision may appear, we\nmust sacrifice our apparatus.\"\n\n\"Let it go, then!\" said Kennedy, promptly.\n\n\"To work!\" said Joe.\n\nIt was no easy job. The apparatus had to be taken down piece by piece.\nFirst, they took out the mixing reservoir, then the one belonging to the\ncylinder, and lastly the tank in which the decomposition of the water\nwas effected. The united strength of all three travellers was required\nto detach these reservoirs from the bottom of the car in which they had\nbeen so firmly secured; but Kennedy was so strong, Joe so adroit, and\nthe doctor so ingenious, that they finally succeeded. The different\npieces were thrown out, one after the other, and they disappeared below,\nmaking huge gaps in the foliage of the sycamores.\n\n\"The black fellows will be mightily astonished,\" said Joe, \"at finding\nthings like those in the woods; they'll make idols of them!\"\n\nThe next thing to be looked after was the displacement of the pipes\nthat were fastened in the balloon and connected with the spiral. Joe\nsucceeded in cutting the caoutchouc jointings above the car, but when he\ncame to the pipes he found it more difficult to disengage them, because\nthey were held by their upper extremity and fastened by wires to the\nvery circlet of the valve.\n\nThen it was that Joe showed wonderful adroitness. In his naked feet, so\nas not to scratch the covering, he succeeded by the aid of the network,\nand in spite of the oscillations of the balloon, in climbing to the\nupper extremity, and after a thousand difficulties, in holding on with\none hand to that slippery surface, while he detached the outside screws\nthat secured the pipes in their place. These were then easily taken out,\nand drawn away by the lower end, which was hermetically sealed by means\nof a strong ligature.\n\nThe Victoria, relieved of this considerable weight, rose upright in the\nair and tugged strongly at the anchor-rope.\n\nAbout midnight this work ended without accident, but at the cost of most\nsevere exertion, and the trio partook of a luncheon of pemmican and cold\npunch, as the doctor had no more fire to place at Joe's disposal.\n\nBesides, the latter and Kennedy were dropping off their feet with\nfatigue.\n\n\"Lie down, my friends, and get some rest,\" said the doctor. \"I'll take\nthe first watch; at two o'clock I'll waken Kennedy; at four, Kennedy\nwill waken Joe, and at six we'll start; and may Heaven have us in its\nkeeping for this last day of the trip!\"\n\nWithout waiting to be coaxed, the doctor's two companions stretched\nthemselves at the bottom of the car and dropped into profound slumber on\nthe instant.\n\nThe night was calm. A few clouds broke against the last quarter of the\nmoon, whose uncertain rays scarcely pierced the darkness. Ferguson,\nresting his elbows on the rim of the car, gazed attentively around him.\nHe watched with close attention the dark screen of foliage that spread\nbeneath him, hiding the ground from his view. The least noise aroused\nhis suspicions, and he questioned even the slightest rustling of the\nleaves.\n\nHe was in that mood which solitude makes more keenly felt, and during\nwhich vague terrors mount to the brain. At the close of such a journey,\nafter having surmounted so many obstacles, and at the moment of touching\nthe goal, one's fears are more vivid, one's emotions keener. The point\nof arrival seems to fly farther from our gaze.\n\nMoreover, the present situation had nothing very consolatory about it.\nThey were in the midst of a barbarous country, and dependent upon a\nvehicle that might fail them at any moment. The doctor no longer counted\nimplicitly on his balloon; the time had gone by when he manoevred it\nboldly because he felt sure of it.\n\nUnder the influence of these impressions, the doctor, from time to time,\nthought that he heard vague sounds in the vast forests around him;\nhe even fancied that he saw a swift gleam of fire shining between the\ntrees. He looked sharply and turned his night-glass toward the spot; but\nthere was nothing to be seen, and the profoundest silence appeared to\nreturn.\n\nHe had, no doubt, been under the dominion of a mere hallucination. He\ncontinued to listen, but without hearing the slightest noise. When his\nwatch had expired, he woke Kennedy, and, enjoining upon him to observe\nthe extremest vigilance, took his place beside Joe, and fell sound\nasleep.\n\nKennedy, while still rubbing his eyes, which he could scarcely keep\nopen, calmly lit his pipe. He then ensconced himself in a corner, and\nbegan to smoke vigorously by way of keeping awake.\n\nThe most absolute silence reigned around him; a light wind shook the\ntree-tops and gently rocked the car, inviting the hunter to taste the\nsleep that stole over him in spite of himself. He strove hard to resist\nit, and repeatedly opened his eyes to plunge into the outer darkness one\nof those looks that see nothing; but at last, yielding to fatigue, he\nsank back and slumbered.\n\nHow long he had been buried in this stupor he knew not, but he was\nsuddenly aroused from it by a strange, unexpected crackling sound.\n\nHe rubbed his eyes and sprang to his feet. An intense glare half-blinded\nhim and heated his cheek--the forest was in flames!\n\n\"Fire! fire!\" he shouted, scarcely comprehending what had happened.\n\nHis two companions started up in alarm.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" was the doctor's immediate exclamation.\n\n\"Fire!\" said Joe. \"But who could--\"\n\nAt this moment loud yells were heard under the foliage, which was now\nilluminated as brightly as the day.\n\n\"Ah! the savages!\" cried Joe again; \"they have set fire to the forest so\nas to be the more certain of burning us up.\"\n\n\"The Talabas! Al-Hadji's marabouts, no doubt,\" said the doctor.\n\nA circle of fire hemmed the Victoria in; the crackling of the dry wood\nmingled with the hissing and sputtering of the green branches; the\nclambering vines, the foliage, all the living part of this vegetation,\nwrithed in the destructive element. The eye took in nothing but one vast\nocean of flame; the large trees stood forth in black relief in this\nhuge furnace, their branches covered with glowing coals, while the whole\nblazing mass, the entire conflagration, was reflected on the clouds,\nand the travellers could fancy themselves enveloped in a hollow globe of\nfire.\n\n\"Let us escape to the ground!\" shouted Kennedy, \"it is our only chance\nof safety!\"\n\nBut Ferguson checked him with a firm grasp, and, dashing at the\nanchor-rope, severed it with one well-directed blow of his hatchet.\nMeanwhile, the flames, leaping up at the balloon, already quivered on\nits illuminated sides; but the Victoria, released from her fastenings,\nspun upward a thousand feet into the air.\n\nFrightful yells resounded through the forest, along with the report of\nfire-arms, while the balloon, caught in a current of air that rose with\nthe dawn of day, was borne to the westward.\n\nIt was now four o'clock in the morning.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FORTY-THIRD.\n\nThe Talabas.--The Pursuit.--A Devastated Country.--The Wind begins to\nfall.--The Victoria sinks.--The last of the Provisions.--The Leaps of\nthe Balloon.--A Defence with Fire-arms.--The Wind freshens.--The Senegal\nRiver.--The Cataracts of Gouina.--The Hot Air.--The Passage of the\nRiver.\n\n\"Had we not taken the precaution to lighten the balloon yesterday\nevening, we should have been lost beyond redemption,\" said the doctor,\nafter a long silence.\n\n\"See what's gained by doing things at the right time!\" replied Joe. \"One\ngets out of scrapes then, and nothing is more natural.\"\n\n\"We are not out of danger yet,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"What do you still apprehend?\" queried Kennedy. \"The balloon can't\ndescend without your permission, and even were it to do so--\"\n\n\"Were it to do so, Dick? Look!\"\n\nThey had just passed the borders of the forest, and the three friends\ncould see some thirty mounted men clad in broad pantaloons and the\nfloating bournouses. They were armed, some with lances, and others with\nlong muskets, and they were following, on their quick, fiery little\nsteeds, the direction of the balloon, which was moving at only moderate\nspeed.\n\nWhen they caught sight of the aeronauts, they uttered savage cries,\nand brandished their weapons. Anger and menace could be read upon\ntheir swarthy faces, made more ferocious by thin but bristling beards.\nMeanwhile they galloped along without difficulty over the low levels and\ngentle declivities that lead down to the Senegal.\n\n\"It is, indeed, they!\" said the doctor; \"the cruel Talabas! the\nferocious marabouts of Al-Hadji! I would rather find myself in the\nmiddle of the forest encircled by wild beasts than fall into the hands\nof these banditti.\"\n\n\"They haven't a very obliging look!\" assented Kennedy; \"and they are\nrough, stalwart fellows.\"\n\n\"Happily those brutes can't fly,\" remarked Joe; \"and that's something.\"\n\n\"See,\" said Ferguson, \"those villages in ruins, those huts burned\ndown--that is their work! Where vast stretches of cultivated land were\nonce seen, they have brought barrenness and devastation.\"\n\n\"At all events, however,\" interposed Kennedy, \"they can't overtake us;\nand, if we succeed in putting the river between us and them, we are\nsafe.\"\n\n\"Perfectly, Dick,\" replied Ferguson; \"but we must not fall to the\nground!\" and, as he said this, he glanced at the barometer.\n\n\"In any case, Joe,\" added Kennedy, \"it would do us no harm to look to\nour fire-arms.\"\n\n\"No harm in the world, Mr. Dick! We are lucky that we didn't scatter\nthem along the road.\"\n\n\"My rifle!\" said the sportsman. \"I hope that I shall never be separated\nfrom it!\"\n\nAnd so saying, Kennedy loaded the pet piece with the greatest care, for\nhe had plenty of powder and ball remaining.\n\n\"At what height are we?\" he asked the doctor.\n\n\"About seven hundred and fifty feet; but we no longer have the power of\nseeking favorable currents, either going up or coming down. We are at\nthe mercy of the balloon!\"\n\n\"That is vexatious!\" rejoined Kennedy. \"The wind is poor; but if we had\ncome across a hurricane like some of those we met before, these vile\nbrigands would have been out of sight long ago.\"\n\n\"The rascals follow us at their leisure,\" said Joe. \"They're only at a\nshort gallop. Quite a nice little ride!\"\n\n\"If we were within range,\" sighed the sportsman, \"I should amuse myself\nwith dismounting a few of them.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said the doctor; \"but then they would have you within range\nalso, and our balloon would offer only too plain a target to the bullets\nfrom their long guns; and, if they were to make a hole in it, I leave\nyou to judge what our situation would be!\"\n\nThe pursuit of the Talabas continued all morning; and by eleven o'clock\nthe aeronauts had made scarcely fifteen miles to the westward.\n\nThe doctor was anxiously watching for the least cloud on the horizon.\nHe feared, above all things, a change in the atmosphere. Should he be\nthrown back toward the Niger, what would become of him? Besides, he\nremarked that the balloon tended to fall considerably. Since the start,\nhe had already lost more than three hundred feet, and the Senegal must\nbe about a dozen miles distant. At his present rate of speed, he could\ncount upon travelling only three hours longer.\n\nAt this moment his attention was attracted by fresh cries. The Talabas\nappeared to be much excited, and were spurring their horses.\n\nThe doctor consulted his barometer, and at once discovered the cause of\nthese symptoms.\n\n\"Are we descending?\" asked Kennedy.\n\n\"Yes!\" replied the doctor.\n\n\"The mischief!\" thought Joe\n\nIn the lapse of fifteen minutes the Victoria was only one hundred and\nfifty feet above the ground; but the wind was much stronger than before.\n\nThe Talabas checked their horses, and soon a volley of musketry pealed\nout on the air.\n\n\"Too far, you fools!\" bawled Joe. \"I think it would be well to keep\nthose scamps at a distance.\"\n\nAnd, as he spoke, he aimed at one of the horsemen who was farthest to\nthe front, and fired. The Talaba fell headlong, and, his companions\nhalting for a moment, the balloon gained upon them.\n\n\"They are prudent!\" said Kennedy.\n\n\"Because they think that they are certain to take us,\" replied the\ndoctor; \"and, they will succeed if we descend much farther. We must,\nabsolutely, get higher into the air.\"\n\n\"What can we throw out?\" asked Joe.\n\n\"All that remains of our stock of pemmican; that will be thirty pounds\nless weight to carry.\"\n\n\"Out it goes, sir!\" said Joe, obeying orders.\n\nThe car, which was now almost touching the ground, rose again, amid the\ncries of the Talabas; but, half an hour later, the balloon was again\nfalling rapidly, because the gas was escaping through the pores of the\ncovering.\n\nEre long the car was once more grazing the soil, and Al-Hadji's black\nriders rushed toward it; but, as frequently happens in like cases, the\nballoon had scarcely touched the surface ere it rebounded, and only came\ndown again a mile away.\n\n\"So we shall not escape!\" said Kennedy, between his teeth.\n\n\"Throw out our reserved store of brandy, Joe,\" cried the doctor; \"our\ninstruments, and every thing that has any weight, even to our last\nanchor, because go they must!\"\n\nJoe flung out the barometers and thermometers, but all that amounted\nto little; and the balloon, which had risen for an instant, fell again\ntoward the ground.\n\nThe Talabas flew toward it, and at length were not more than two hundred\npaces away.\n\n\"Throw out the two fowling-pieces!\" shouted Ferguson.\n\n\"Not without discharging them, at least,\" responded the sportsman; and\nfour shots in quick succession struck the thick of the advancing group\nof horsemen. Four Talabas fell, amid the frantic howls and imprecations\nof their comrades.\n\nThe Victoria ascended once more, and made some enormous leaps, like\na huge gum-elastic ball, bounding and rebounding through the air. A\nstrange sight it was to see these unfortunate men endeavoring to escape\nby those huge aerial strides, and seeming, like the giant Antaeus,\nto receive fresh strength every time they touched the earth. But this\nsituation had to terminate. It was now nearly noon; the Victoria was\ngetting empty and exhausted, and assuming a more and more elongated\nform every instant. Its outer covering was becoming flaccid, and floated\nloosely in the air, and the folds of the silk rustled and grated on each\nother.\n\n\"Heaven abandons us!\" said Kennedy; \"we have to fall!\"\n\nJoe made no answer. He kept looking intently at his master.\n\n\"No!\" said the latter; \"we have more than one hundred and fifty pounds\nyet to throw out.\"\n\n\"What can it be, then?\" said Kennedy, thinking that the doctor must be\ngoing mad.\n\n\"The car!\" was his reply; \"we can cling to the network. There we can\nhang on in the meshes until we reach the river. Quick! quick!\"\n\nAnd these daring men did not hesitate a moment to avail themselves of\nthis last desperate means of escape. They clutched the network, as the\ndoctor directed, and Joe, holding on by one hand, with the other cut the\ncords that suspended the car; and the latter dropped to the ground just\nas the balloon was sinking for the last time.\n\n\"Hurrah! hurrah!\" shouted the brave fellow exultingly, as the Victoria,\nonce more relieved, shot up again to a height of three hundred feet.\n\nThe Talabas spurred their horses, which now came tearing on at a furious\ngallop; but the balloon, falling in with a much more favorable wind,\nshot ahead of them, and was rapidly carried toward a hill that stretched\nacross the horizon to the westward. This was a circumstance favorable to\nthe aeronauts, because they could rise over the hill, while Al-Hadji's\nhorde had to diverge to the northward in order to pass this obstacle.\n\nThe three friends still clung to the network. They had been able to\nfasten it under their feet, where it had formed a sort of swinging\npocket.\n\nSuddenly, after they had crossed the hill, the doctor exclaimed: \"The\nriver! the river! the Senegal, my friends!\"\n\nAnd about two miles ahead of them, there was indeed the river rolling\nalong its broad mass of water, while the farther bank, which was low and\nfertile, offered a sure refuge, and a place favorable for a descent.\n\n\"Another quarter of an hour,\" said Ferguson, \"and we are saved!\"\n\nBut it was not to happen thus; the empty balloon descended slowly upon a\ntract almost entirely bare of vegetation. It was made up of long slopes\nand stony plains, a few bushes and some coarse grass, scorched by the\nsun.\n\nThe Victoria touched the ground several times, and rose again, but her\nrebound was diminishing in height and length. At the last one, it caught\nby the upper part of the network in the lofty branches of a baobab,\nthe only tree that stood there, solitary and alone, in the midst of the\nwaste.\n\n\"It's all over,\" said Kennedy.\n\n\"And at a hundred paces only from the river!\" groaned Joe.\n\nThe three hapless aeronauts descended to the ground, and the doctor drew\nhis companions toward the Senegal.\n\nAt this point the river sent forth a prolonged roaring; and when\nFerguson reached its bank, he recognized the falls of Gouina. But not\na boat, not a living creature was to be seen. With a breadth of two\nthousand feet, the Senegal precipitates itself for a height of one\nhundred and fifty, with a thundering reverberation. It ran, where they\nsaw it, from east to west, and the line of rocks that barred its course\nextended from north to south. In the midst of the falls, rocks of\nstrange forms started up like huge ante-diluvian animals, petrified\nthere amid the waters.\n\nThe impossibility of crossing this gulf was self-evident, and Kennedy\ncould not restrain a gesture of despair.\n\nBut Dr. Ferguson, with an energetic accent of undaunted daring,\nexclaimed--\n\n\"All is not over!\"\n\n\"I knew it,\" said Joe, with that confidence in his master which nothing\ncould ever shake.\n\nThe sight of the dried-up grass had inspired the doctor with a bold\nidea. It was the last chance of escape. He led his friends quickly back\nto where they had left the covering of the balloon.\n\n\"We have at least an hour's start of those banditti,\" said he; \"let us\nlose no time, my friends; gather a quantity of this dried grass; I want\na hundred pounds of it, at least.\"\n\n\"For what purpose?\" asked Kennedy, surprised.\n\n\"I have no more gas; well, I'll cross the river with hot air!\"\n\n\"Ah, doctor,\" exclaimed Kennedy, \"you are, indeed, a great man!\"\n\nJoe and Kennedy at once went to work, and soon had an immense pile of\ndried grass heaped up near the baobab.\n\nIn the mean time, the doctor had enlarged the orifice of the balloon by\ncutting it open at the lower end. He then was very careful to expel the\nlast remnant of hydrogen through the valve, after which he heaped up a\nquantity of grass under the balloon, and set fire to it.\n\nIt takes but a little while to inflate a balloon with hot air. A head of\none hundred and eighty degrees is sufficient to diminish the weight of\nthe air it contains to the extent of one-half, by rarefying it. Thus,\nthe Victoria quickly began to assume a more rounded form. There was no\nlack of grass; the fire was kept in full blast by the doctor's assiduous\nefforts, and the balloon grew fuller every instant.\n\nIt was then a quarter to four o'clock.\n\nAt this moment the band of Talabas reappeared about two miles to the\nnorthward, and the three friends could hear their cries, and the clatter\nof their horses galloping at full speed.\n\n\"In twenty minutes they will be here!\" said Kennedy.\n\n\"More grass! more grass, Joe! In ten minutes we shall have her full of\nhot air.\"\n\n\"Here it is, doctor!\"\n\nThe Victoria was now two-thirds inflated.\n\n\"Come, my friends, let us take hold of the network, as we did before.\"\n\n\"All right!\" they answered together.\n\nIn about ten minutes a few jerking motions by the balloon indicated that\nit was disposed to start again. The Talabas were approaching. They were\nhardly five hundred paces away.\n\n\"Hold on fast!\" cried Ferguson.\n\n\"Have no fear, master--have no fear!\"\n\nAnd the doctor, with his foot pushed another heap of grass upon the\nfire.\n\nWith this the balloon, now completely inflated by the increased\ntemperature, moved away, sweeping the branches of the baobab in her\nflight.\n\n\"We're off!\" shouted Joe.\n\nA volley of musketry responded to his exclamation. A bullet even\nploughed his shoulder; but Kennedy, leaning over, and discharging his\nrifle with one hand, brought another of the enemy to the ground.\n\nCries of fury exceeding all description hailed the departure of the\nballoon, which had at once ascended nearly eight hundred feet. A swift\ncurrent caught and swept it along with the most alarming oscillations,\nwhile the intrepid doctor and his friends saw the gulf of the cataracts\nyawning below them.\n\nTen minutes later, and without having exchanged a word, they descended\ngradually toward the other bank of the river.\n\nThere, astonished, speechless, terrified, stood a group of men clad in\nthe French uniform. Judge of their amazement when they saw the balloon\nrise from the right bank of the river. They had well-nigh taken it for\nsome celestial phenomenon, but their officers, a lieutenant of marines\nand a naval ensign, having seen mention made of Dr. Ferguson's daring\nexpedition, in the European papers, quickly explained the real state of\nthe case.\n\nThe balloon, losing its inflation little by little, settled with the\ndaring travellers still clinging to its network; but it was doubtful\nwhether it would reach the land. At once some of the brave Frenchmen\nrushed into the water and caught the three aeronauts in their arms just\nas the Victoria fell at the distance of a few fathoms from the left bank\nof the Senegal.\n\n\"Dr. Ferguson!\" exclaimed the lieutenant.\n\n\"The same, sir,\" replied the doctor, quietly, \"and his two friends.\"\n\nThe Frenchmen escorted our travellers from the river, while the balloon,\nhalf-empty, and borne away by a swift current, sped on, to plunge,\nlike a huge bubble, headlong with the waters of the Senegal, into the\ncataracts of Gouina.\n\n\"The poor Victoria!\" was Joe's farewell remark.\n\nThe doctor could not restrain a tear, and extending his hands his two\nfriends wrung them silently with that deep emotion which requires no\nspoken words.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FORTY-FOURTH.\n\nConclusion.--The Certificate.--The French Settlements.--The Post of\nMedina.--The Basilic.--Saint Louis.--The English Frigate.--The Return to\nLondon.\n\nThe expedition upon the bank of the river had been sent by the governor\nof Senegal. It consisted of two officers, Messrs. Dufraisse, lieutenant\nof marines, and Rodamel, naval ensign, and with these were a sergeant\nand seven soldiers. For two days they had been engaged in reconnoitring\nthe most favorable situation for a post at Gouina, when they became\nwitnesses of Dr. Ferguson's arrival.\n\nThe warm greetings and felicitations of which our travellers were the\nrecipients may be imagined. The Frenchmen, and they alone, having had\nocular proof of the accomplishment of the daring project, naturally\nbecame Dr. Ferguson's witnesses. Hence the doctor at once asked them to\ngive their official testimony of his arrival at the cataracts of Gouina.\n\n\"You would have no objection to signing a certificate of the fact, would\nyou?\" he inquired of Lieutenant Dufraisse.\n\n\"At your orders!\" the latter instantly replied.\n\nThe Englishmen were escorted to a provisional post established on the\nbank of the river, where they found the most assiduous attention, and\nevery thing to supply their wants. And there the following certificate\nwas drawn up in the terms in which it appears to-day, in the archives of\nthe Royal Geographical Society of London:\n\n\"We, the undersigned, do hereby declare that, on the day herein\nmentioned, we witnessed the arrival of Dr. Ferguson and his two\ncompanions, Richard Kennedy and Joseph Wilson, clinging to the cordage\nand network of a balloon, and that the said balloon fell at a distance\nof a few paces from us into the river, and being swept away by the\ncurrent was lost in the cataracts of Gouina. In testimony whereof,\nwe have hereunto set our hands and seals beside those of the persons\nhereinabove named, for the information of all whom it may concern.\n\n\"Done at the Cataracts of Gouina, on the 24th of May, 1862.\n\n   \"(Signed),   \"SAMUEL FERGUSON\n                \"RICHARD KENNEDY,\n                \"JOSEPH WILSON,\n                \"DUFRAISSE, Lieutenant of Marines,\n                \"RODAMEL, Naval Ensign,\n                \"DUFAYS, Sergeant,\n                \"FLIPPEAU, MAYOR,   }\n                \"PELISSIER, LOROIS, } Privates.\"\n                   RASCAGNET, GUIL- }\n                   LON, LEBEL,      }\n\n\nHere ended the astonishing journey of Dr. Ferguson and his brave\ncompanions, as vouched for by undeniable testimony; and they found\nthemselves among friends in the midst of most hospitable tribes, whose\nrelations with the French settlements are frequent and amicable.\n\nThey had arrived at Senegal on Saturday, the 24th of May, and on the\n27th of the same month they reached the post of Medina, situated a\nlittle farther to the north, but on the river.\n\nThere the French officers received them with open arms, and lavished\nupon them all the resources of their hospitality. Thus aided, the doctor\nand his friends were enabled to embark almost immediately on the small\nsteamer called the Basilic, which ran down to the mouth of the river.\n\nTwo weeks later, on the 10th of June, they arrived at Saint Louis,\nwhere the governor gave them a magnificent reception, and they recovered\ncompletely from their excitement and fatigue.\n\nBesides, Joe said to every one who chose to listen:\n\n\"That was a stupid trip of ours, after all, and I wouldn't advise any\nbody who is greedy for excitement to undertake it. It gets very tiresome\nat the last, and if it hadn't been for the adventures on Lake Tchad and\nat the Senegal River, I do believe that we'd have died of yawning.\"\n\nAn English frigate was just about to sail, and the three travellers\nprocured passage on board of her. On the 25th of June they arrived at\nPortsmouth, and on the next day at London.\n\nWe will not describe the reception they got from the Royal Geographical\nSociety, nor the intense curiosity and consideration of which they\nbecame the objects. Kennedy set off, at once, for Edinburgh, with his\nfamous rifle, for he was in haste to relieve the anxiety of his faithful\nold housekeeper.\n\nThe doctor and his devoted Joe remained the same men that we have known\nthem, excepting that one change took place at their own suggestion.\n\nThey ceased to be master and servant, in order to become bosom friends.\n\nThe journals of all Europe were untiring in their praises of the bold\nexplorers, and the Daily Telegraph struck off an edition of three\nhundred and seventy-seven thousand copies on the day when it published a\nsketch of the trip.\n\nDoctor Ferguson, at a public meeting of the Royal Geographical Society,\ngave a recital of his journey through the air, and obtained for himself\nand his companions the golden medal set apart to reward the most\nremarkable exploring expedition of the year 1862.\n\n*****\n\nThe first result of Dr. Ferguson's expedition was to establish, in the\nmost precise manner, the facts and geographical surveys reported by\nMessrs. Barth, Burton, Speke, and others. Thanks to the still\nmore recent expeditions of Messrs. Speke and Grant, De Heuglin and\nMuntzinger, who have been ascending to the sources of the Nile, and\npenetrating to the centre of Africa, we shall be enabled ere long to\nverify, in turn, the discoveries of Dr. Ferguson in that vast region\ncomprised between the fourteenth and thirty-third degrees of east\nlongitude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Five Weeks in a Balloon, by Jules Verne\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FIVE WEEKS IN A BALLOON ***\n\n***** This file should be named 3526.txt or 3526.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/5/2/3526/\n\nProduced by Judy Boss\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
