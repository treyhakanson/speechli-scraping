Rider Haggard\n\n\nOriginal Digital Editor's Note:\n\nIn the interest of readability, where italics are used to indicate\nnon-English words, I have silently omitted them or replaced them with\nquotation marks.\n\n\n\n\nDEDICATION\n\nDitchingham, 1912.\n\nMy dear Sir Henry,--\n\nNearly thirty-seven years have gone by, more than a generation, since\nfirst we saw the shores of Southern Africa rising from the sea. Since\nthen how much has happened: the Annexation of the Transvaal, the Zulu\nWar, the first Boer War, the discovery of the Rand, the taking of\nRhodesia, the second Boer War, and many other matters which in these\nquick-moving times are now reckoned as ancient history.\n\nAlas! I fear that were we to re-visit that country we should find\nbut few faces which we knew. Yet of one thing we may be glad. Those\nhistorical events, in some of which you, as the ruler of Natal, played\na great part, and I, as it chanced, a smaller one, so far as we can\nforesee, have at length brought a period of peace to Southern Africa.\nTo-day the flag of England flies from the Zambesi to the Cape. Beneath\nits shadow may all ancient feuds and blood jealousies be forgotten.\nMay the natives prosper also and be justly ruled, for after all in the\nbeginning the land was theirs. Such, I know, are your hopes, as they are\nmine.\n\nIt is, however, with an earlier Africa that this story deals. In 1836,\nhate and suspicion ran high between the Home Government and its\nDutch subjects. Owing to the freeing of the slaves and mutual\nmisunderstandings, the Cape Colony was then in tumult, almost in\nrebellion, and the Boers, by thousands, sought new homes in the unknown,\nsavage-peopled North. Of this blood-stained time I have tried to\ntell; of the Great Trek and its tragedies, such as the massacre of the\ntrue-hearted Retief and his companions at the hands of the Zulu king,\nDingaan.\n\nBut you have read the tale and know its substance. What, then, remains\nfor me to say? Only that in memory of long-past days I dedicate it to\nyou whose image ever springs to mind when I strive to picture an English\ngentleman as he should be. Your kindness I never shall forget; in memory\nof it, I offer you this book.\n\nEver sincerely yours,\n\nH. RIDER HAGGARD.\n\nTo Sir Henry Bulwer, G.C.M.G.\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\n\nThe Author hopes that the reader may find some historical interest in\nthe tale set out in these pages of the massacre of the Boer general,\nRetief, and his companions at the hands of the Zulu king, Dingaan.\nSave for some added circumstances, he believes it to be accurate in its\ndetails.\n\nThe same may be said of the account given of the hideous sufferings of\nthe trek-Boers who wandered into the fever veld, there to perish in the\nneighbourhood of Delagoa Bay. Of these sufferings, especially those that\nwere endured by Triechard and his companions, a few brief contemporary\nrecords still exist, buried in scarce works of reference. It may be\nmentioned, also, that it was a common belief among the Boers of that\ngeneration that the cruel death of Retief and his companions, and other\nmisfortunes which befell them, were due to the treacherous plottings of\nan Englishman, or of Englishmen, with the despot, Dingaan.\n\n\n\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE\n\nThe following extract explains how the manuscript of \"Marie,\" and with\nit some others, one of which is named \"Child of Storm,\" came into the\nhands of the Editor.\n\nIt is from a letter, dated January 17th, 1909, and written by Mr.\nGeorge Curtis, the brother of Sir Henry Curtis, Bart., who, it will\nbe remembered, was one of the late Mr. Allan Quatermain's friends and\ncompanions in adventure when he discovered King Solomon's Mines, and who\nafterwards disappeared with him in Central Africa.\n\n\nThis extract runs as follows:--\n\n\"You may recall that our mutual and dear friend, old Allan Quatermain,\nleft me the sole executor of his will, which he signed before he set\nout with my brother Henry for Zuvendis, where he was killed. The Court,\nhowever, not being satisfied that there was any legal proof of his\ndeath, invested the capital funds in trustee securities, and by my\nadvice let his place in Yorkshire to a tenant who has remained in\noccupation of it during the last two decades. Now that tenant is\ndead, and at the earnest prayer of the Charities which benefit under\nQuatermain's will, and of myself--for in my uncertain state of health\nI have for long been most anxious to wind up this executorship--about\neight months ago the Court at last consented to the distribution of this\nlarge fund in accordance with the terms of the will.\n\n\"This, of course, involved the sale of the real property, and before it\nwas put up to auction I went over the house in company of the solicitor\nappointed by the Court. On the top landing, in the room Quatermain used\nto occupy, we found a sealed cupboard that I opened. It proved to be\nfull of various articles which evidently he had prized because of their\nassociations with his earthy life. These I need not enumerate here,\nespecially as I have reserved them as his residuary legatee and, in the\nevent of my death, they will pass to you under my will.\n\n\"Among these relics, however, I found a stout box, made of some red\nforeign wood, that contained various documents and letters and a\nbundle of manuscripts. Under the tape which fastened these manuscripts\ntogether, as you will see, is a scrap of paper on which is written, in\nblue pencil, a direction signed 'Allan Quatermain,' that in the event of\nanything happening to him, these MSS. are to be sent to you (for whom,\nas you know, he had a high regard), and that at your sole discretion you\nare to burn or publish them as you may see fit.\n\n\"So, after all these years, as we both remain alive, I carry out our old\nfriend's instructions and send you his bequest, which I trust may prove\nof interest and value. I have read the MS. called 'Marie,' and certainly\nam of the opinion that it ought to be published, for I think it a\nstrange and moving tale of a great love--full, moreover, of forgotten\nhistory.\n\n\"That named 'Child of Storm' also seems very interesting as a study of\nsavage life, and the others may be the same; but my eyes are troubling\nme so much that I have not been able to decipher them. I hope, however,\nthat I may be spared long enough to see them in print.\n\n\"Poor old Allan Quatermain. It is as though he had suddenly reappeared\nfrom the dead! So at least I thought as I perused these stories of a\nperiod of his life of which I do not remember his speaking to me.\n\n\"And now my responsibility in this matter is finished and yours begins.\nDo what you like about the manuscripts.\"\n\n\"George Curtis.\"\n\n\nAs may be imagined, I, the Editor, was considerably astonished when I\nreceived this letter and the accompanying bundle of closely-written MSS.\nTo me also it was as though my old friend had risen from the grave and\nonce more stood before me, telling some history of his stormy and\ntragic past in that quiet, measured voice that I have never been able to\nforget.\n\nThe first manuscript I read was that entitled \"Marie.\" It deals with Mr.\nQuatermain's strange experiences when as a very young man he accompanied\nthe ill-fated Pieter Retief and the Boer Commission on an embassy to\nthe Zulu despot, Dingaan. This, it will be remembered, ended in their\nmassacre, Quatermain himself and his Hottentot servant Hans being the\nsole survivors of the slaughter. Also it deals with another matter more\npersonal to himself, namely, his courtship of and marriage to his first\nwife, Marie Marais.\n\nOf this Marie I never heard him speak, save once. I remember that on a\ncertain occasion--it was that of a garden f\u00eate for a local charity--I\nwas standing by Quatermain when someone introduced to him a young girl\nwho was staying in the neighborhood and had distinguished herself\nby singing very prettily at the f\u00eate. Her surname I forget, but her\nChristian name was Marie. He started when he heard it, and asked if she\nwere French. The young lady answered No, but only of French extraction\nthrough her grandmother, who also was called Marie.\n\n\"Indeed?\" he said. \"Once I knew a maiden not unlike you who was also of\nFrench extraction and called Marie. May you prove more fortunate in life\nthan she was, though better or nobler you can never be,\" and he bowed to\nher in his simple, courtly fashion, then turned away. Afterwards, when\nwe were alone, I asked him who was this Marie of whom he had spoken to\nthe young lady. He paused a little, then answered:\n\n\"She was my first wife, but I beg you not to speak of her to me or to\nanyone else, for I cannot bear to hear her name. Perhaps you will learn\nall about her one day.\" Then, to my grief and astonishment, he broke\ninto something like a sob and abruptly left the room.\n\nAfter reading the record of this Marie I can well understand why he was\nso moved. I print it practically as it left his hands.\n\nThere are other MSS. also, one of which, headed \"Child of Storm,\"\nrelates the moving history of a beautiful and, I fear I must add,\nwicked Zulu girl named Mameena who did much evil in her day and went\nunrepentant from the world.\n\nAnother, amongst other things, tells the secret story of the causes\nof the defeat of Cetewayo and his armies by the English in 1879, which\nhappened not long before Quatermain met Sir Henry Curtis and Captain\nGood.\n\nThese three narratives are, indeed, more or less connected with each\nother. At least, a certain aged dwarf, called Zikali, a witch-doctor\nand an terrible man, has to do with all of them, although in the first,\n\"Marie,\" he is only vaguely mentioned in connection with the massacre\nof Retief, whereof he was doubtless the primary instigator. As \"Marie\"\ncomes first in chronological order, and was placed on the top of the\npile by its author, I publish it first. With the others I hope to deal\nlater on, as I may find time and opportunity.\n\nBut the future must take care of itself. We cannot control it, and its\nevents are not in our hand. Meanwhile, I hope that those who in their\nyouth have read of King Solomon's Mines and Zuvendis, and perhaps\nsome others who are younger, may find as much of interest in these new\nchapters of the autobiography of Allan Quatermain as I have done myself.\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n     I.

ALLAN LEARNS FRENCH\n\n\nAlthough in my old age I, Allan Quatermain, have taken to writing--after\na fashion--never yet have I set down a single word of the tale of my\nfirst love and of the adventures that are grouped around her beautiful\nand tragic history. I suppose this is because it has always seemed to\nme too holy and far-off a matter--as holy and far-off as is that heaven\nwhich holds the splendid spirit of Marie Marais. But now, in my age,\nthat which was far-off draws near again; and at night, in the depths\nbetween the stars, sometimes I seem to see the opening doors through\nwhich I must pass, and leaning earthwards across their threshold, with\noutstretched arms and dark and dewy eyes, a shadow long forgotten by all\nsave me--the shadow of Marie Marais.\n\nAn old man's dream, doubtless, no more. Still, I will try to set down\nthat history which ended in so great a sacrifice, and one so worthy of\nrecord, though I hope that no human eye will read it until I also am\nforgotten, or, at any rate, have grown dim in the gathering mists of\noblivion. And I am glad that I have waited to make this attempt, for it\nseems to me that only of late have I come to understand and appreciate\nat its true value the character of her of whom I tell, and the\npassionate affection which was her bounteous offering to one so utterly\nunworthy as myself. What have I done, I wonder, that to me should have\nbeen decreed the love of two such women as Marie and that of Stella,\nalso now long dead, to whom alone in the world I told all her tale?\nI remember I feared lest she should take it ill, but this was not so.\nIndeed, during our brief married days, she thought and talked much of\nMarie, and some of her last words to me were that she was going to seek\nher, and that they would wait for me together in the land of love, pure\nand immortal.\n\nSo with Stella's death all that side of life came to an end for me,\nsince during the long years which stretch between then and now I have\nnever said another tender word to woman. I admit, however, that once,\nlong afterwards, a certain little witch of a Zulu did say tender words\nto me, and for an hour or so almost turned my head, an art in which she\nhad great skill. This I say because I wish to be quite honest, although\nit--I mean my head, for there was no heart involved in the matter--came\nstraight again at once. Her name was Mameena, and I have set down her\nremarkable story elsewhere.\n\nTo return. As I have already written in another book, I passed my youth\nwith my old father, a Church of England clergyman, in what is now the\nCradock district of the Cape Colony.\n\nThen it was a wild place enough, with a very small white population.\nAmong our few neighbours was a Boer farmer of the name of Henri Marais,\nwho lived about fifteen miles from our station, on a fine farm called\nMaraisfontein. I say he was a Boer, but, as may be guessed from both his\nChristian and surname, his origin was Huguenot, his forefather, who\nwas also named Henri Marais--though I think the Marais was spelt\nrather differently then--having been one of the first of that faith who\nemigrated to South Africa to escape the cruelties of Louis XIV. at the\ntime of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes.\n\nUnlike most Boers of similar descent, these particular Marais--for,\nof course, there are many other families so called--never forgot their\norigin. Indeed, from father to son, they kept up some knowledge of the\nFrench tongue, and among themselves often spoke it after a fashion.\nAt any rate, it was the habit of Henri Marais, who was excessively\nreligious, to read his chapter of the Bible (which it is, or was, the\ncustom of the Boers to spell out every morning, should their learning\nallow them to do so), not in the \"taal\" or patois Dutch, but in good\nold French. I have the very book from which he used to read now, for,\ncuriously enough, in after years, when all these events had long been\ngathered to the past, I chanced to buy it among a parcel of other\nworks at the weekly auction of odds and ends on the market square of\nMaritzburg. I remember that when I opened the great tome, bound over\nthe original leather boards in buckskin, and discovered to whom it had\nbelonged, I burst into tears. There was no doubt about it, for, as was\ncustomary in old days, this Bible had sundry fly-leaves sewn up with it\nfor the purpose of the recording of events important to its owner.\n\nThe first entries were made by the original Henri Marais, and record how\nhe and his compatriots were driven from France, his father having lost\nhis life in the religious persecutions. After this comes a long list of\nbirths, marriages and deaths continued from generation to generation,\nand amongst them a few notes telling of such matters as the change of\nthe dwelling-places of the family, always in French. Towards the end of\nthe list appears the entry of the birth of the Henri Marais whom I knew,\nalas! too well, and of his only sister. Then is written his marriage to\nMarie Labuschagne, also, be it noted, of the Huguenot stock. In the\nnext year follows the birth of Marie Marais, my Marie, and, after a\nlong interval, for no other children were born, the death of her mother.\nImmediately below appears the following curious passage:\n\n\"Le 3 Janvier, 1836. Je quitte ce pays voulant me sauver du maudit\ngouvernement Britannique comme mes anc\u00eatres se sont sauv\u00e9s de ce\ndiable--Louis XIV.\n\n\"A bas les rois et les ministres tyrannique! Vive la libert\u00e9!\"\n\nWhich indicates very clearly the character and the opinions of Henri\nMarais, and the feeling among the trek-Boers at that time.\n\nThus the record closes and the story of the Marais ends--that is, so far\nas the writings in the Bible go, for that branch of the family is now\nextinct.\n\nTheir last chapter I will tell in due course.\n\n\nThere was nothing remarkable about my introduction to Marie Marais. I\ndid not rescue her from any attack of a wild beast or pull her out of a\nraging river in a fashion suited to romance. Indeed, we interchanged our\nyoung ideas across a small and extremely massive table, which, in fact,\nhad once done duty as a block for the chopping up of meat. To this hour\nI can see the hundreds of lines running criss-cross upon its surface,\nespecially those opposite to where I used to sit.\n\nOne day, several years after my father had emigrated to the Cape, the\nHeer Marais arrived at our house in search, I think, of some lost\noxen. He was a thin, bearded man with rather wild, dark eyes set close\ntogether, and a quick nervous manner, not in the least like that of a\nDutch Boer--or so I recall him. My father received him courteously and\nasked him to stop to dine, which he did.\n\nThey talked together in French, a tongue that my father knew well,\nalthough he had not used it for years; Dutch he could not, or, rather,\nwould not, speak if he could help it, and Mr. Marais preferred not to\ntalk English. To meet someone who could converse in French delighted\nhim, and although his version of the language was that of two centuries\nbefore and my father's was largely derived from reading, they got on\nvery well together, if not too fast.\n\nAt length, after a pause, Mr. Marais, pointing to myself, a small and\nstubbly-haired youth with a sharp nose, asked my father whether he\nwould like me to be instructed in the French tongue. The answer was that\nnothing would please him better.\n\n\"Although,\" he added severely, \"to judge by my own experience where\nLatin and Greek are concerned, I doubt his capacity to learn anything.\"\n\nSo an arrangement was made that I should go over for two days in each\nweek to Maraisfontein, sleeping there on the intervening night, and\nacquire a knowledge of the French tongue from a tutor whom Mr. Marais\nhad hired to instruct his daughter in that language and other subjects.\nI remember that my father agreed to pay a certain proportion of this\ntutor's salary, a plan which suited the thrifty Boer very well indeed.\n\nThither, accordingly, I went in due course, nothing loth, for on the\nveld between our station and Maraisfontein many pauw and koran--that is,\nbig and small bustards--were to be found, to say nothing of occasional\nbuck, and I was allowed to carry a gun, which even in those days I\ncould use fairly well. So to Maraisfontein I rode on the appointed day,\nattended by a Hottentot after-rider, a certain Hans, of whom I shall\nhave a good deal to tell. I enjoyed very good sport on the road,\narriving at the stead laden with one pauw, two koran, and a little\nklipspringer buck which I had been lucky enough to shoot as it bounded\nout of some rocks in front of me.\n\nThere was a peach orchard planted round Maraisfontein, which just then\nwas a mass of lovely pink blossom, and as I rode through it slowly, not\nbeing sure of my way to the house, a lanky child appeared in front of\nme, clad in a frock which exactly matched the colour of the peach bloom.\nI can see her now, her dark hair hanging down her back, and her big, shy\neyes staring at me from the shadow of the Dutch \"kappie\" which she\nwore. Indeed, she seemed to be all eyes, like a \"dikkop\" or thick-headed\nplover; at any rate, I noted little else about her.\n\nI pulled up my pony and stared at her, feeling very shy and not knowing\nwhat to say. For a while she stared back at me, being afflicted,\npresumably, with the same complaint, then spoke with an effort, in a\nvoice that was very soft and pleasant.\n\n\"Are you the little Allan Quatermain who is coming to learn French with\nme?\" she asked in Dutch.\n\n\"Of course,\" I answered in the same tongue, which I knew well; \"but\nwhy do you call me little, missie? I am taller than you,\" I added\nindignantly, for when I was young my lack of height was always a sore\npoint with me.\n\n\"I think not,\" she replied. \"But get off that horse, and we will measure\nhere against this wall.\"\n\nSo I dismounted, and, having assured herself that I had no heels to my\nboots (I was wearing the kind of raw-hide slippers that the Boers call\n\"veld-shoon\"), she took the writing slate which she was carrying--it had\nno frame, I remember, being, in fact, but a piece of the material used\nfor roofing--and, pressing it down tight on my stubbly hair, which stuck\nup then as now, made a deep mark in the soft sandstone of the wall with\nthe hard pointed pencil.\n\n\"There,\" she said, \"that is justly done. Now, little Allan, it is your\nturn to measure me.\"\n\nSo I measured her, and, behold! she was the taller by a whole half-inch.\n\n\"You are standing on tiptoe,\" I said in my vexation.\n\n\"Little Allan,\" she replied, \"to stand on tiptoe would be to lie before\nthe good Lord, and when you come to know me better you will learn that,\nthough I have a dreadful temper and many other sins, I do not lie.\"\n\nI suppose that I looked snubbed and mortified, for she went on in her\ngrave, grown-up way: \"Why are you angry because God made me taller than\nyou? especially as I am whole months older, for my father told me so.\nCome, let us write our names against these marks, so that in a year\nor two you may see how you outgrow me.\" Then with the slate pencil she\nscratched \"Marie\" against her mark very deeply, so that it might last,\nshe said; after which I wrote \"Allan\" against mine.\n\nAlas! Within the last dozen years chance took me past Maraisfontein\nonce more. The house had long been rebuilt, but this particular wall yet\nstood. I rode to it and looked, and there faintly could still be seen\nthe name Marie, against the little line, and by it the mark that I had\nmade. My own name and with it subsequent measurements were gone, for\nin the intervening forty years or so the sandstone had flaked away in\nplaces. Only her autograph remained, and when I saw it I think that I\nfelt even worse than I did on finding whose was the old Bible that I had\nbought upon the market square at Maritzburg.\n\nI know that I rode away hurriedly without even stopping to inquire into\nwhose hands the farm had passed. Through the peach orchard I rode, where\nthe trees--perhaps the same, perhaps others--were once more in bloom,\nfor the season of the year was that when Marie and I first met, nor did\nI draw rein for half a score of miles.\n\nBut here I may state that Marie always stayed just half an inch the\ntaller in body, and how much taller in mind and spirit I cannot tell.\n\n\nWhen we had finished our measuring match Marie turned to lead me to\nthe house, and, pretending to observe for the first time the beautiful\nbustard and the two koran hanging from my saddle, also the klipspringer\nbuck that Hans the Hottentot carried behind him on his horse, asked:\n\n\"Did you shoot all these, Allan Quatermain?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered proudly; \"I killed them in four shots, and the pauw\nand koran were flying, not sitting, which is more than you could have\ndone, although you are taller, Miss Marie.\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" she answered reflectively. \"I can shoot very well with\na rifle, for my father has taught me, but I never would shoot at living\nthings unless I must because I was hungry, for I think that to kill is\ncruel. But, of course, it is different with men,\" she added hastily,\n\"and no doubt you will be a great hunter one day, Allan Quatermain,\nsince you can already aim so well.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" I answered, blushing at the compliment, \"for I love\nhunting, and when there are so many wild things it does not matter if we\nkill a few. I shot these for you and your father to eat.\"\n\n\"Come, then, and give them to him. He will thank you,\" and she led the\nway through the gate in the sandstone wall into the yard, where the\noutbuildings stood in which the riding horses and the best of the\nbreeding cattle were kept at night, and so past the end of the long,\none-storied house, that was stone-built and whitewashed, to the stoep or\nveranda in front of it.\n\nOn the broad stoep, which commanded a pleasant view over rolling,\npark-like country, where mimosa and other trees grew in clumps, two men\nwere seated, drinking strong coffee, although it was not yet ten o'clock\nin the morning.\n\nHearing the sound of the horses, one of these, Mynheer Marais, whom I\nalready knew, rose from his hide-strung chair. He was, as I think I\nhave said, not in the least like one of the phlegmatic Boers, either in\nperson or in temperament, but, rather, a typical Frenchman, although no\nmember of his race had set foot in France for a hundred and fifty years.\nAt least so I discovered afterwards, for, of course, in those days I\nknew nothing of Frenchmen.\n\nHis companion was also French, Leblanc by name, but of a very different\nstamp. In person he was short and stout. His large head was bald except\nfor a fringe of curling, iron-grey hair which grew round it just above\nthe ears and fell upon his shoulders, giving him the appearance of a\ntonsured but dishevelled priest. His eyes were blue and watery, his\nmouth was rather weak, and his cheeks were pale, full and flabby. When\nthe Heer Marais rose, I, being an observant youth, noted that Monsieur\nLeblanc took the opportunity to stretch out a rather shaky hand and fill\nup his coffee cup out of a black bottle, which from the smell I judged\nto contain peach brandy.\n\nIn fact, it may as well be said at once that the poor man was a\ndrunkard, which explains how he, with all his high education and great\nability, came to hold the humble post of tutor on a remote Boer farm.\nYears before, when under the influence of drink, he had committed some\ncrime in France--I don't know what it was, and never inquired--and fled\nto the Cape to avoid prosecution. Here he obtained a professorship at\none of the colleges, but after a while appeared in the lecture-room\nquite drunk and lost his employment. The same thing happened in other\ntowns, till at last he drifted to distant Maraisfontein, where his\nemployer tolerated his weakness for the sake of the intellectual\ncompanionship for which something in his own nature seemed to crave.\nAlso, he looked upon him as a compatriot in distress, and a great bond\nof union between them was their mutual and virulent hatred of England\nand the English, which in the case of Monsieur Leblanc, who in his youth\nhad fought at Waterloo and been acquainted with the great Emperor, was\nnot altogether unnatural.\n\nHenri Marais's case was different, but of that I shall have more to say\nlater.\n\n\"Ah, Marie,\" said her father, speaking in Dutch, \"so you have found him\nat last,\" and he nodded towards me, adding: \"You should be flattered,\nlittle man. Look you, this missie has been sitting for two hours in\nthe sun waiting for you, although I told her you would not arrive\nmuch before ten o'clock, as your father the pr\u00e9dicant said you would\nbreakfast before you started. Well, it is natural, for she is lonely\nhere, and you are of an age, although of a different race\"; and his face\ndarkened as he spoke the words.\n\n\"Father,\" answered Marie, whose blushes I could see even in the shadow\nof her cap, \"I was not sitting in the sun, but under the shade of a\npeach tree. Also, I was working out the sums that Monsieur Leblanc set\nme on my slate. See, here they are,\" and she held up the slate, which\nwas covered with figures, somewhat smudged, it is true, by the rubbing\nof my stiff hair and of her cap.\n\nThen Monsieur Leblanc broke in, speaking in French, of which, as it\nchanced I understood the sense, for my father had grounded me in that\ntongue, and I am naturally quick at modern languages. At any rate, I\nmade out that he was asking if I was the little \"cochon d'anglais,\" or\nEnglish pig, whom for his sins he had to teach. He added that he judged\nI must be, as my hair stuck up on my head--I had taken off my hat out of\npoliteness--as it naturally would do on a pig's back.\n\nThis was too much for me, so, before either of the others could speak, I\nanswered in Dutch, for rage made me eloquent and bold:\n\n\"Yes, I am he; but, mynheer, if you are to be my master, I hope you will\nnot call the English pigs any more to me.\"\n\n\"Indeed, gamin\" (that is, little scamp), \"and pray, what will happen if\nI am so bold as to repeat that truth?\"\n\n\"I think, mynheer,\" I replied, growing white with rage at this new\ninsult, \"the same that has happened to yonder buck,\" and I pointed to\nthe klipspringer behind Hans's saddle. \"I mean that I shall shoot you.\"\n\n\"Peste! Au moins il a du courage, cet enfant\" (At least the child is\nplucky), exclaimed Monsieur Leblanc, astonished. From that moment, I may\nadd, he respected me, and never again insulted my country to my face.\n\nThen Marais broke out, speaking in Dutch that I might understand:\n\n\"It is you who should be called pig, Leblanc, not this boy, for, early\nas it is, you have been drinking. Look! the brandy bottle is half empty.\nIs that the example you set to the young? Speak so again and I turn you\nout to starve on the veld. Allan Quatermain, although, as you may have\nheard, I do not like the English, I beg your pardon. I hope you will\nforgive the words this sot spoke, thinking that you did not understand,\"\nand he took off his hat and bowed to me quite in a grand manner, as his\nancestors might have done to a king of France.\n\nLeblanc's face fell. Then he rose and walked away rather unsteadily;\nas I learned afterwards, to plunge his head in a tub of cold water and\nswallow a pint of new milk, which were his favourite antidotes after\ntoo much strong drink. At any rate, when he appeared again, half an hour\nlater, to begin our lesson, he was quite sober, and extremely polite.\n\nWhen he had gone, my childish anger being appeased, I presented the Heer\nMarais with my father's compliments, also with the buck and the birds,\nwhereof the latter seemed to please him more than the former. Then my\nsaddle-bags were taken to my room, a little cupboard of a place next to\nthat occupied by Monsieur Leblanc, and Hans was sent to turn the horses\nout with the others belonging to the farm, having first knee-haltered\nthem tightly, so that they should not run away home.\n\nThis done, the Heer Marais showed me the room in which we were to have\nour lessons, one of the \"sitkammer\", or sitting chambers, whereof,\nunlike most Boer stead, this house boasted two. I remember that the\nfloor was made of \"daga\", that is, ant-heap earth mixed with cow-dung,\ninto which thousands of peach-stones had been thrown while it was\nstill soft, in order to resist footwear--a rude but fairly efficient\nexpedient, and one not unpleasing to the eye. For the rest, there was\none window opening on to the veranda, which, in that bright climate,\nadmitted a shaded but sufficient light, especially as it always stood\nopen; the ceiling was of unplastered reeds; a large bookcase stood in\nthe corner containing many French works, most of them the property of\nMonsieur Leblanc, and in the centre of the room was the strong, rough\ntable made of native yellow-wood, that once had served as a butcher's\nblock. I recollect also a coloured print of the great Napoleon\ncommanding at some battle in which he was victorious, seated upon a\nwhite horse and waving a field-marshal's baton over piles of dead and\nwounded; and near the window, hanging to the reeds of the ceiling,\nthe nest of a pair of red-tailed swallows, pretty creatures that,\nnotwithstanding the mess they made, afforded to Marie and me endless\namusement in the intervals of our work.\n\nWhen, on that day, I shuffled shyly into this homely place, and,\nthinking myself alone there, fell to examining it, suddenly I was\nbrought to a standstill by a curious choking sound which seemed to\nproceed from the shadows behind the bookcase. Wondering as to its cause,\nI advanced cautiously to discover a pink-clad shape standing in the\ncorner like a naughty child, with her head resting against the wall, and\nsobbing slowly.\n\n\"Marie Marais, why do you cry?\" I asked.\n\nShe turned, tossing back the locks of long, black hair which hung about\nher face, and answered:\n\n\"Allan Quatermain, I cry because of the shame which has been put upon\nyou and upon our house by that drunken Frenchman.\"\n\n\"What of that?\" I asked. \"He only called me a pig, but I think I have\nshown him that even a pig has tusks.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied, \"but it was not you he meant; it was all the\nEnglish, whom he hates; and the worst of it is that my father is of his\nmind. He, too, hates the English, and, oh! I am sure that trouble will\ncome of his hatred, trouble and death to many.\"\n\n\"Well, if so, we have nothing to do with it, have we?\" I replied with\nthe cheerfulness of extreme youth.\n\n\"What makes you so sure?\" she said solemnly. \"Hush! here comes Monsieur\nLeblanc.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. THE ATTACK ON MARAISFONTEIN\n\n\nI do not propose to set out the history of the years which I spent in\nacquiring a knowledge of French and various other subjects, under the\ntuition of the learned but prejudiced Monsieur Leblanc. Indeed, there\nis \"none to tell, sir.\" When Monsieur Leblanc was sober, he was a most\nexcellent and well-informed tutor, although one apt to digress into many\nside issues, which in themselves were not uninstructive. When tipsy, he\ngrew excited and harangued us, generally upon politics and religion, or\nrather its reverse, for he was an advanced freethinker, although this\nwas a side to his character which, however intoxicated he might be, he\nalways managed to conceal from the Heer Marais. I may add that a certain\nchildish code of honour prevented us from betraying his views on this\nand sundry other matters. When absolutely drunk, which, on an average,\nwas not more than once a month, he simply slept, and we did what we\npleased--a fact which our childish code of honour also prevented us from\nbetraying.\n\nBut, on the whole, we got on very well together, for, after the incident\nof our first meeting, Monsieur Leblanc was always polite to me. Marie\nhe adored, as did every one about the place, from her father down to the\nmeanest slave. Need I add that I adored her more than all of them put\ntogether, first with the love that some children have for each other,\nand afterwards, as we became adult, with that wider love by which it\nis at once transcended and made complete. Strange would it have been\nif this were not so, seeing that we spent nearly half of every week\npractically alone together, and that, from the first, Marie, whose\nnature was as open as the clear noon, never concealed her affection for\nme. True, it was a very discreet affection, almost sisterly, or even\nmotherly, in its outward and visible aspects, as though she could never\nforget that extra half-inch of height or month or two of age.\n\nMoreover, from a child she was a woman, as an Irishman might say, for\ncircumstances and character had shaped her thus. Not much more than a\nyear before we met, her mother, whose only child she was, and whom she\nloved with all her strong and passionate heart, died after a lingering\nillness, leaving her in charge of her father and his house. I think it\nwas this heavy bereavement in early youth which coloured her nature with\na grey tinge of sadness and made her seem so much older than her years.\n\nSo the time went on, I worshipping Marie in my secret thought, but\nsaying nothing about it, and Marie talking of and acting towards me as\nthough I were her dear younger brother. Nobody, not even her father\nor mine, or Monsieur Leblanc, took the slightest notice of this\nqueer relationship, or seemed to dream that it might lead to ultimate\ncomplications which, in fact, would have been very distasteful to them\nall for reasons that I will explain.\n\nNeedless to say, in due course, as they were bound to do, those\ncomplications arose, and under pressure of great physical and moral\nexcitement the truth came out. It happened thus.\n\nEvery reader of the history of the Cape Colony has heard of the great\nKaffir War of 1835. That war took place for the most part in the\ndistricts of Albany and Somerset, so that we inhabitants of Cradock,\non the whole, suffered little. Therefore, with the natural optimism and\ncarelessness of danger of dwellers in wild places, we began to think\nourselves fairly safe from attack. Indeed, so we should have been, had\nit not been for a foolish action on the part of Monsieur Leblanc.\n\nIt seems that on a certain Sunday, a day that I always spent at home\nwith my father, Monsieur Leblanc rode out alone to some hills about five\nmiles distant from Maraisfontein. He had often been cautioned that this\nwas an unsafe thing to do, but the truth is that the foolish man thought\nhe had found a rich copper mine in these hills, and was anxious that no\none should share his secret. Therefore, on Sundays, when there were\nno lessons, and the Heer Marais was in the habit of celebrating family\nprayers, which Leblanc disliked, it was customary for him to ride to\nthese hills and there collect geological specimens and locate the strike\nof his copper vein. On this particular Sabbath, which was very hot,\nafter he had done whatever he intended to do, he dismounted from his\nhorse, a tame old beast. Leaving it loose, he partook of the meal he had\nbrought with him, which seems to have included a bottle of peach brandy\nthat induced slumber.\n\nWaking up towards evening, he found that his horse had gone, and at once\njumped to the conclusion that it had been stolen by Kaffirs, although\nin truth the animal had but strolled over a ridge in search of grass.\nRunning hither and thither to seek it, he presently crossed this ridge\nand met the horse, apparently being led away by two of the Red Kaffirs,\nwho, as was usual, were armed with assegais. As a matter of fact these\nmen had found the beast, and, knowing well to whom it belonged, were\nseeking its owner, whom, earlier in the day, they had seen upon the\nhills, in order to restore it to him. This, however, never occurred\nto the mind of Monsieur Leblanc, excited as it was by the fumes of the\npeach brandy.\n\nLifting the double-barrelled gun he carried, he fired at the first\nKaffir, a young man who chanced to be the eldest son and heir of the\nchief of the tribe, and, as the range was very close, shot him dead.\nThereon his companion, leaving go of the horse, ran for his life. At him\nLeblanc fired also, wounding him slightly in the thigh, but no more, so\nthat he escaped to tell the tale of what he and every other native for\nmiles round considered a wanton and premeditated murder. The deed done,\nthe fiery old Frenchman mounted his nag and rode quietly home. On the\nroad, however, as the peach brandy evaporated from his brain, doubts\nentered it, with the result that he determined to say nothing of his\nadventure to Henri Marais, who he knew was particularly anxious to avoid\nany cause of quarrel with the Kaffirs.\n\nSo he kept his own counsel and went to bed. Before he was up next\nmorning the Heer Marais, suspecting neither trouble nor danger, had\nridden off to a farm thirty miles or more away to pay its owner for some\ncattle which he had recently bought, leaving his home and his daughter\nquite unprotected, except by Leblanc and the few native servants, who\nwere really slaves, that lived about the place.\n\nNow on the Monday night I went to bed as usual, and slept, as I have\nalways done through life, like a top, till about four in the morning,\nwhen I was awakened by someone tapping at the glass of my window.\nSlipping from the bed, I felt for my pistol, as it was quite dark, crept\nto the window, opened it, and keeping my head below the level of the\nsill, fearing lest its appearance should be greeted with an assegai,\nasked who was there.\n\n\"Me, baas,\" said the voice of Hans, our Hottentot servant, who, it will\nbe remembered, had accompanied me as after-rider when first I went to\nMaraisfontein. \"I have bad news. Listen. The baas knows that I have been\nout searching for the red cow which was lost. Well, I found her, and was\nsleeping by her side under a tree on the veld when, about two hours ago,\na woman whom I know came up to my camp fire and woke me. I asked her\nwhat she was doing at that hour of the night, and she answered that she\nhad come to tell me something. She said that some young men of the tribe\nof the chief Quabie, who lives in the hills yonder, had been visiting\nat their kraal, and that a few hours before a messenger had arrived from\nthe chief saying that they must return at once, as this morning at dawn\nhe and all his men were going to attack Maraisfontein and kill everyone\nin it and take the cattle!\"\n\n\"Good God!\" I ejaculated. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Because, young baas,\" drawled the Hottentot from the other side of the\nwindow, \"because someone from Maraisfontein--I think it was the Vulture\"\n(the natives gave this name to Leblanc on account of his bald head\nand hooked nose)--\"shot Quabie's son on Sunday when he was holding his\nhorse.\"\n\n\"Good God!\" I said again, \"the old fool must have been drunk. When did\nyou say the attack was to be--at dawn?\" and I glanced at the stars,\nadding, \"Why, that will be within less than an hour, and the Baas Marais\nis away.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" croaked Hans; \"and Missie Marie--think of what the Red Kaffirs\nwill do with Missie Marie when their blood is up.\"\n\nI thrust my fist through the window and struck the Hottentot's toad-like\nface on which the starlight gleamed faintly.\n\n\"Dog!\" I said, \"saddle my mare and the roan horse and get your gun. In\ntwo minutes I come. Be swift or I kill you.\"\n\n\"I go,\" he answered, and shot out into the night like a frightened\nsnake.\n\nThen I began to dress, shouting as I dressed, till my father and the\nKaffirs ran into the room. As I threw on my things I told them all.\n\n\"Send out messengers,\" I said, \"to Marais--he is at Botha's farm--and to\nall the neighbours. Send, for your lives; gather up the friendly Kaffirs\nand ride like hell for Maraisfontein. Don't talk to me, father; don't\ntalk! Go and do what I tell you. Stay! Give me two guns, fill the\nsaddle-bags with powder tins and loopers, and tie them to my mare. Oh!\nbe quick, be quick!\"\n\nNow at length they understood, and flew this way and that with candles\nand lanterns. Two minutes later--it could scarcely have been more--I\nwas in front of the stables just as Hans led out the bay mare, a famous\nbeast that for two years I had saved all my money to buy. Someone\nstrapped on the saddle-bags while I tested the girths; someone else\nappeared with the stout roan stallion that I knew would follow the mare\nto the death. There was not time to saddle him, so Hans clambered on to\nhis back like a monkey, holding two guns under his arm, for I carried\nbut one and my double-barrelled pistol.\n\n\"Send off the messengers,\" I shouted to my father. \"If you would see me\nagain send them swiftly, and follow with every man you can raise.\"\n\nThen we were away with fifteen miles to do and five-and-thirty minutes\nbefore the dawn.\n\n\"Softly up the slope,\" I said to Hans, \"till the beasts get their wind,\nand then ride as you never rode before.\"\n\nThose first two miles of rising ground! I thought we should never come\nto the end of them, and yet I dared not let the mare out lest she should\nbucket herself. Happily she and her companion, the stallion--a most\nenduring horse, though not so very swift--had stood idle for the last\nthirty hours, and, of course, had not eaten or drunk since sunset.\nTherefore being in fine fettle, they were keen for the business; also we\nwere light weights.\n\nI held in the mare as she spurted up the rise, and the horse kept his\npace to hers. We reached its crest, and before us lay the great\nlevel plain, eleven miles of it, and then two miles down hill to\nMaraisfontein.\n\n\"Now,\" I said to Hans, shaking loose the reins, \"keep up if you can!\"\n\nAway sped the mare till the keen air of the night sung past my ears, and\nbehind her strained the good roan horse with the Hottentot monkey on its\nback. Oh! what a ride was that!\n\nFurther I have gone for a like cause, but never at such speed, for I\nknew the strength of the beasts and how long it would last them. Half an\nhour of it they might endure; more, and at this pace they must founder\nor die.\n\nAnd yet such was the agony of my fear, that it seemed to me as though I\nonly crept along the ground like a tortoise.\n\nThe roan was left behind, the sound of his foot-beats died away, and I\nwas alone with the night and my fear. Mile added itself to mile, for now\nand again the starlight showed me a stone or the skeleton of some\ndead beast that I knew. Once I dashed into a herd of trekking game so\nsuddenly, that a springbok, unable to stop itself, leapt right over\nme. Once the mare put her foot in an ant-bear hole and nearly fell, but\nrecovered herself--thanks be to God, unharmed--and I worked myself back\ninto the saddle whence I had been almost shaken. If I had fallen; oh! if\nI had fallen!\n\nWe were near the end of the flat, and she began to fail. I had\nover-pressed her; the pace was too tremendous. Her speed lessened to an\nordinary fast gallop as she faced the gentle rise that led to the brow.\nAnd now, behind me, once more I heard the sound of the hoofs of the\nroan. The tireless beast was coming up. By the time we reached the edge\nof the plateau he was quite near, not fifty yards behind, for I heard\nhim whinny faintly.\n\nThen began the descent. The morning star was setting, the east grew grey\nwith light. Oh! could we get there before the dawn? Could we get there\nbefore the dawn? That is what my horse's hoofs beat out to me.\n\nNow I could see the mass of the trees about the stead. And now I dashed\ninto something, though until I was through it, I did not know that it\nwas a line of men, for the faint light gleamed upon the spear of one of\nthem who had been overthrown!\n\nSo it was no lie! The Kaffirs were there! As I thought it, a fresh\nhorror filled my heart; perhaps their murdering work was already done\nand they were departing.\n\nThe minute of suspense--or was it but seconds?--seemed an eternity. But\nit ended at last. Now I was at the door in the high wall that enclosed\nthe outbuildings at the back of the house, and there, by an inspiration,\npulled up the mare--glad enough she was to stop, poor thing--for it\noccurred to me that if I rode to the front I should very probably be\nassegaied and of no further use. I tried the door, which was made\nof stout stinkwood planks. By design, or accident, it had been left\nunbolted. As I thrust it open Hans arrived with a rush, clinging to the\nroan with his face hidden in its mane. The beast pulled up by the side\nof the mare which it had been pursuing, and in the faint light I saw\nthat an assegai was fixed in its flank.\n\nFive seconds later we were in the yard and locking and barring the\ndoor behind us. Then, snatching the saddle-bags of ammunition from the\nhorses, we left them standing there, and I ran for the back entrance\nof the house, bidding Hans rouse the natives, who slept in the\noutbuildings, and follow with them. If any one of them showed signs of\ntreachery he was to shoot him at once. I remember that as I went I tore\nthe spear out of the stallion's flank and brought it away with me.\n\nNow I was hammering upon the back door of the house, which I could not\nopen. After a pause that seemed long, a window was thrown wide, and a\nvoice--it was Marie's--asked in frightened tones who was there.\n\n\"I, Allan Quatermain,\" I answered. \"Open at once, Marie. You are in\ngreat danger; the Red Kaffirs are going to attack the house.\"\n\nShe flew to the door in her nightdress, and at length I was in the\nplace.\n\n\"Thank God! you are still safe,\" I gasped. \"Put on your clothes while I\ncall Leblanc. No, stay, do you call him; I must wait here for Hans and\nyour slaves.\"\n\nAway she sped without a word, and presently Hans arrived, bringing with\nhim eight frightened men, who as yet scarcely knew whether they slept or\nwoke.\n\n\"Is that all?\" I asked. \"Then bar the door and follow me to the\n'sitkammer', where the baas keeps his guns.\"\n\nJust as we reached it, Leblanc entered, clad in his shirt and trousers,\nand was followed presently by Marie with a candle.\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked.\n\nI took the candle from Marie's hand, and set it on the floor close to\nthe wall, lest it should prove a target for an assegai or a bullet. Even\nin those days the Kaffirs had a few firearms, for the most part captured\nor stolen from white men. Then in a few words I told them all.\n\n\"And when did you learn all this?\" asked Leblanc in French.\n\n\"At the Mission Station a little more than half an hour ago,\" I\nanswered, looking at my watch.\n\n\"At the station a little more than half an hour ago! Peste! it is not\npossible. You dream or are drunken,\" he cried excitedly.\n\n\"All right, monsieur, we will argue afterwards,\" I answered. \"Meanwhile\nthe Kaffirs are here, for I rode through them; and if you want to save\nyour life, stop talking and act. Marie, how many guns are there?\"\n\n\"Four,\" she answered, \"of my father's; two 'roers' and two smaller\nones.\"\n\n\"And how many of these men\"--and I pointed to the Kaffirs--\"can shoot?\"\n\n\"Three well and one badly, Allan.\"\n\n\"Good,\" I said. \"Let them load the guns with 'loopers'\"--that is, slugs,\nnot bullets--\"and let the rest stand in the passage with their assegais,\nin case the Quabies should try to force the back door.\"\n\nNow, in this house there were in all but six windows, one to each\nsitting-room, one to each of the larger bedrooms, these four opening on\nto the veranda, and one at either end of the house, to give light and\nair to the two small bedrooms, which were approached through the larger\nbedrooms. At the back, fortunately, there were no windows, for the stead\nwas but one room deep with passage running from the front to the back\ndoor, a distance of little over fifteen feet.\n\nAs soon as the guns were loaded I divided up the men, a man with a gun\nat each window. The right-hand sitting-room window I took myself with\ntwo guns, Marie coming with me to load, which, like all girls in that\nwild country, she could do well enough. So we arranged ourselves in\na rough-and-ready fashion, and while we were doing it felt quite\ncheerful--that is, all except Monsieur Leblanc, who, I noticed, seemed\nvery much disturbed.\n\nI do not for one moment mean to suggest that he was afraid, as he might\nwell have been, for he was an extremely brave and even rash man; but\nI think the knowledge that his drunken act had brought this terrible\ndanger upon us all weighed on his mind. Also there may have been more;\nsome subtle fore-knowledge of the approaching end to a life that, when\nall allowances were made, could scarcely be called well spent. At any\nrate he fidgeted at his window-place cursing beneath his breath, and\nsoon, as I saw out of the corner of my eye, began to have recourse\nto his favourite bottle of peach brandy, which he fetched out of a\ncupboard.\n\nThe slaves, too, were gloomy, as all natives are when suddenly awakened\nin the night; but as the light grew they became more cheerful. It is a\npoor Kaffir that does not love fighting, especially when he has a gun\nand a white man or two to lead him.\n\nNow that we had made such little preparations as we could, which, by the\nway, I supplemented by causing some furniture to be piled up against\nthe front and back doors, there came a pause, which, speaking for my own\npart--being, after all, only a lad at the time--I found very trying\nto the nerves. There I stood at my window with the two guns, one a\ndouble-barrel and one a single \"roer\", or elephant gun, that took\na tremendous charge, but both, be it remembered, flint locks; for,\nalthough percussion caps had been introduced, we were a little behind\nthe times in Cradock. There, too, crouched on the ground beside me,\nholding the ammunition ready for re-loading, her long, black hair\nflowing about her shoulders, was Marie Marais, now a well-grown young\nwoman. In the intense silence she whispered to me:\n\n\"Why did you come here, Allan? You were safe yonder, and now you will\nprobably be killed.\"\n\n\"To try to save you,\" I answered simply. \"What would you have had me\ndo?\"\n\n\"To try to save me? Oh! that is good of you, but you should have thought\nof yourself.\"\n\n\"Then I should still have thought of you, Marie.\"\n\n\"Why, Allan?\"\n\n\"Because you are myself and more than myself. If anything happened to\nyou, what would my life be to me?\"\n\n\"I don't quite understand, Allan,\" she replied, staring down at the\nfloor. \"Tell me, what do you mean?\"\n\n\"Mean, you silly girl,\" I said; \"what can I mean, except that I love\nyou, which I thought you knew long ago.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she said; \"_now_ I understand.\" Then she raised herself upon her\nknees, and held up her face to me to kiss, adding, \"There, that's my\nanswer, the first and perhaps the last. Thank you, Allan dear; I am glad\nto have heard that, for you see one or both of us may die soon.\"\n\nAs she spoke the words, an assegai flashed through the window-place,\npassing just between our heads. So we gave over love-making and turned\nour attention to war.\n\nNow the light was beginning to grow, flowing out of the pearly eastern\nsky; but no attack had yet been delivered, although that one was\nimminent that spear fixed in the plaster of the wall behind us showed\nclearly. Perhaps the Kaffirs had been frightened by the galloping of\nhorses through their line in the dark, not knowing how many of them\nthere might have been. Or perhaps they were waiting to see better where\nto deliver their onset. These were the ideas that occurred to me, but\nboth were wrong.\n\nThey were staying their hands until the mist lifted a little from the\nhollow below the stead where the cattle kraals were situated, for while\nthe fog remained they could not see to get the beasts out. These they\nwished to make sure of and drive away before the fight began, lest\nduring its progress something should happen to rob them of their booty.\n\nPresently, from these kraals, where the Heer Marais's horned beasts and\nsheep were penned at night, about one hundred and fifty of the former\nand some two thousand of the latter, to say nothing of the horses, for\nhe was a large and prosperous farmer, there arose a sound of bellowing,\nneighing, and baaing, and with it that of the shouting of men.\n\n\"They are driving off the stock,\" said Marie. \"Oh! my poor father, he is\nruined; it will break his heart.\"\n\n\"Bad enough,\" I answered, \"but there are things that might be worse.\nHark!\"\n\nAs I spoke there came a sound of stamping feet and of a wild war chant.\nThen in the edge of the mist that hung above the hollow where the\ncattle kraals were, figures appeared, moving swiftly to and fro, looking\nghostly and unreal. The Kaffirs were marshalling their men for the\nattack. A minute more and it had begun. On up the slope they came in\nlong, wavering lines, several hundreds of them, whistling and screaming,\nshaking their spears, their war-plumes and hair trappings blown back by\nthe breeze, the lust of slaughter in their rolling eyes. Two or three of\nthem had guns, which they fired as they ran, but where the bullets went\nI do not know, over the house probably.\n\nI called out to Leblanc and the Kaffirs not to shoot till I did, for I\nknew that they were poor marksmen and that much depended upon our first\nvolley being effective. Then as the captain of this attack came within\nthirty yards of the stoep--for now the light, growing swiftly, was\nstrong enough to enable me to distinguish him by his apparel and the\nrifle which he held--I loosed at him with the \"roer\" and shot him\ndead. Indeed the heavy bullet passing through his body mortally wounded\nanother of the Quabies behind. These were the first men that I ever\nkilled in war.\n\nAs they fell, Leblanc and the rest of our people fired also, the slugs\nfrom their guns doing great execution at that range, which was just long\nenough to allow them to scatter. When the smoke cleared a little I saw\nthat nearly a dozen men were down, and that the rest, dismayed by this\nreception, had halted. If they had come on then, while we were loading,\ndoubtless they might have rushed the place; but, being unused to the\nterrible effects of firearms, they paused, amazed. A number of them,\ntwenty or thirty perhaps, clustered about the bodies of the fallen\nKaffirs, and, seizing my second gun, I fired both barrels at these with\nsuch fearful effect that the whole regiment took to their heels and\nfled, leaving their dead and wounded on the ground. As they ran our\nservants cheered, but I called to them to be silent and load swiftly,\nknowing well that the enemy would soon return.\n\nFor a time, however, nothing happened, although we could hear them\ntalking somewhere near the cattle kraal, about a hundred and fifty yards\naway. Marie took advantage of this pause, I remember, to fetch food and\ndistribute it among us. I, for one, was glad enough to get it.\n\nNow the sun was up, a sight for which I thanked Heaven, for, at any\nrate, we could no longer be surprised. Also, with the daylight, some\nof my fear passed away, since darkness always makes danger twice as\nterrible to man and beast. Whilst we were still eating and fortifying\nthe window-places as best we could, so as to make them difficult to\nenter, a single Kaffir appeared, waving above his head a stick to which\nwas tied a white ox-tail as a sign of truce. I ordered that no one\nshould fire, and when the man, who was a bold fellow, had reached the\nspot where the dead captain lay, called to him, asking his business, for\nI could speak his language well.\n\nHe answered that he had come with a message from Quabie. This was the\nmessage: that Quabie's eldest son had been cruelly murdered by the fat\nwhite man called \"Vulture\" who lived with the Heer Marais, and that he,\nQuabie, would have blood for blood. Still, he did not wish to kill the\nyoung white chieftainess (that was Marie) or the others in the house,\nwith whom he had no quarrel. Therefore if we would give up the fat white\nman that he might make him \"die slowly,\" Quabie would be content with\nhis life and with the cattle that he had already taken by way of a fine,\nand leave us and the house unmolested.\n\nNow, when Leblanc understood the nature of this offer he went perfectly\nmad with mingled fear and rage, and began to shout and swear in French.\n\n\"Be silent,\" I said; \"we do not mean to surrender you, although you have\nbrought all this trouble on us. Your chance of life is as good as ours.\nAre you not ashamed to act so before these black people?\"\n\nWhen at last he grew more or less quiet I called to the messenger that\nwe white folk were not in the habit of abandoning each other, and that\nwe would live or die together. Still, I bade him tell Quabie that if we\ndid die, the vengeance taken on him and all his people would be to wipe\nthem out till not one of them was left, and therefore that he would do\nwell not to cause any of our blood to flow. Also, I added, that we had\nthirty men in the house (which, of course, was a lie) and plenty of\nammunition and food, so that if he chose to continue the attack it would\nbe the worse for him and his tribe.\n\nOn hearing this the herald shouted back that we should every one of us\nbe dead before noon if he had his way. Still, he would report my words\nfaithfully to Quabie and bring his answer.\n\nThen he turned and began to walk off. Just as he did so a shot was fired\nfrom the house, and the man pitched forward to the ground, then rose\nagain and staggered back towards his people, with his right shoulder\nshattered and his arm swinging.\n\n\"Who did that?\" I asked through the smoke, which prevented me from\nseeing.\n\n\"I, parbleu!\" shouted Leblanc. \"Sapristi! that black devil wanted to\ntorture me, Leblanc, the friend of the great Napoleon. Well, at least I\nhave tortured him whom I meant to kill.\"\n\n\"Yes, you fool,\" I answered; \"and we, too, shall be tortured because of\nyour wickedness. You have shot a messenger carrying a flag of truce, and\nthat the Quabies will never forgive. Oh! I tell you that you have hit us\nas well as him, who had it not been for you might have been spared.\"\n\nThese words I said quite quietly and in Dutch, so that our Kaffirs might\nunderstand them, though really I was boiling with wrath.\n\nBut Leblanc did not answer quietly.\n\n\"Who are you,\" he shouted, \"you wretched little Englishman, who dare to\nlecture me, Leblanc, the friend of the great Napoleon?\"\n\nNow I drew my pistol and walked up to the man.\n\n\"Be quiet, you drunken sot,\" I said, for I guessed that he had drunk\nmore of the brandy in the darkness. \"If you are not quiet and do not\nobey me, who am in command here, either I will blow your brains out, or\nI will give you to these men,\" and I pointed to Hans and the Kaffirs,\nwho had gathered round him, muttering ominously. \"Do you know what they\nwill do with you? They will throw you out of the house, and leave you to\nsettle your quarrel with Quabie alone.\"\n\nLeblanc looked first at the pistol, and next at the faces of the\nnatives, and saw something in one or other of them, or in both, that\ncaused him to change his note.\n\n\"Pardon, monsieur,\" he said; \"I was excited. I knew not what I said.\nIf you are young you are brave and clever, and I will obey you,\" and he\nwent to his station and began to re-load his gun. As he did so a great\nshout of fury rose from the cattle kraal. The wounded herald had reached\nthe Quabies and was telling them of the treachery of the white people.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. THE RESCUE\n\n\nThe second Quabie advance did not begin till about half-past seven. Even\nsavages love their lives and appreciate the fact that wounds hurt very\nmuch, and these were no exception to the rule. Their first rush had\ntaught them a bitter lesson, of which the fruit was evident in the\ncrippled or dying men who rolled to and fro baked in the hot sun within\na few yards of the stoep, not to speak of those who would never stir\nagain. Now, the space around the house being quite open and bare of\ncover, it was obvious that it could not be stormed without further heavy\nlosses. In order to avoid such losses a civilised people would have\nadvanced by means of trenches, but of these the Quabies knew nothing;\nmoreover, digging tools were lacking to them.\n\nSo it came about that they hit upon another, and in the circumstances\na not inefficient expedient. The cattle kraal was built of rough,\nunmortared stones. Those stones they took, each man carrying two or\nthree, which, rushing forward, they piled up into scattered rough\ndefences of about eighteen inches or two feet high. These defences were\ninstantly occupied by as many warriors as could take shelter behind\nthem, lying one on top of the other. Of course, those savages who\ncarried the first stones were exposed to our fire, with the result that\nmany of them fell, but there were always plenty more behind. As they\nwere being built at a dozen different points, and we had but seven guns,\nbefore we could reload, a particular schanz, of which perhaps the first\nbuilders had fallen, would be raised so high that our slugs could no\nlonger hurt those who lay behind it. Also, our supply of ammunition was\nlimited, and the constant expenditure wasted it so much that at length\nonly about six charges per man remained. At last, indeed, I was obliged\nto order the firing to cease, so that we might reserve ourselves for the\ngreat rush which could not now be much delayed.\n\nFinding that they were no longer harassed by our bullets, the Quabies\nadvanced more rapidly, directing their attack upon the south end of the\nhouse, where there was but one window, and thus avoiding the fire that\nmight be poured upon them from the various openings under the veranda.\nAt first I wondered why they selected this end, till Marie reminded me\nthat this part of the dwelling was thatched with reeds, whereas the rest\nof the building, which had been erected more recently, was slated.\n\nTheir object was to fire the roof. So soon as their last wall was near\nenough (that is, about half-past ten of the clock) they began to throw\ninto the thatch assegais to which were attached bunches of burning\ngrass. Many of these went out, but at length, as we gathered from\ntheir shouts, one caught. Within ten minutes this part of the house was\nburning.\n\nNow our state became desperate. We retreated across the central passage,\nfearing lest the blazing rafters should fall upon our natives, who were\nlosing heart and would no longer stay beneath them. But the Quabies,\nmore bold, clambered in through the south window, and attacked us in the\ndoorway of the larger sitting-room.\n\nHere the final fight began. As they rushed at us we shot, till they went\ndown in heaps. Almost at our last charge they gave back, and just then\nthe roof fell upon them.\n\nOh, what a terrible scene was that! The dense clouds of smoke, the\nscreams of the trapped and burning men, the turmoil, the agony!\n\nThe front door was burst in by a flank onslaught.\n\nLeblanc and a slave who was near him were seized by black, claw-like\nhands and dragged out. What became of the Frenchman I do not know, for\nthe natives hauled him away, but I fear his end must have been dreadful,\nas he was taken alive. The servant I saw them assegai, so at least he\ndied at once. I fired my last shot, killing a fellow who was flourishing\na battle-axe, then dashed the butt of the gun into the face of the man\nbehind him, felling him, and, seizing Marie by the hand, dragged her\nback into the northernmost room--that in which I was accustomed to\nsleep--and shut and barred the door.\n\n\"Allan,\" she gasped, \"Allan dear, it is finished. I cannot fall into the\nhands of those men. Kill me, Allan.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I answered, \"I will. I have my pistol. One barrel for you\nand one for me.\"\n\n\"No, no! Perhaps you might escape after all; but, you see, I am a woman,\nand dare not risk it. Come now, I am ready,\" and she knelt down, opening\nher arms to receive the embrace of death, and looked up at me with her\nlovely, pitiful eyes.\n\n\"It doesn't do to kill one's love and live on oneself,\" I answered\nhoarsely. \"We have got to go together,\" and I cocked both barrels of the\npistol.\n\nThe Hottentot, Hans, who was in the place with us, saw and understood.\n\n\"It is right, it is best!\" he said; and turning, he hid his eyes with\nhis hand.\n\n\"Wait a little, Allan,\" she exclaimed; \"it will be time when the door is\ndown, and perhaps God may still help us.\"\n\n\"He may,\" I answered doubtfully; \"but I would not count on it. Nothing\ncan save us now unless the others come to rescue us, and that's too much\nto hope for.\"\n\nThen a thought struck me, and I added with a dreadful laugh: \"I wonder\nwhere we shall be in five minutes.\"\n\n\"Oh! together, dear; together for always in some new and beautiful\nworld, for you do love me, don't you, as I love you? Maybe that's better\nthan living on here where we should be sure to have troubles and perhaps\nbe separated at last.\"\n\nI nodded my head, for though I loved life, I loved Marie more, and\nI felt that we were making a good end after a brave fight. They were\nbattering at the door now, but, thank Heaven, Marais had made strong\ndoors, and it held a while.\n\nThe wood began to give at last, an assegai appeared through a shattered\nplank, but Hans stabbed along the line of it with the spear he held,\nthat which I had snatched from the flank of the horse, and it was\ndropped with a scream. Black hands were thrust through the hole, and the\nHottentot hacked and cut at them with the spear. But others came, more\nthan he could pierce, and the whole door-frame began to be dragged\noutwards.\n\n\"Now, Marie, be ready,\" I gasped, lifting the pistol.\n\n\"Oh, Christ receive me!\" she answered faintly. \"It won't hurt much, will\nit, Allan?\"\n\n\"You will never feel anything,\" I whispered; as with the cold sweat\npouring from me I placed the muzzle within an inch of her forehead and\nbegan to press the trigger. My God! yes, I actually began to press the\ntrigger softly and steadily, for I wished to make no mistake.\n\nIt was at this very moment, above the dreadful turmoil of the roaring\nflames, the yells of the savages and the shrieks and groans of wounded\nand dying men, that I heard the sweetest sound which ever fell upon my\nears--the sound of shots being fired, many shots, and quite close by.\n\n\"Great Heaven!\" I screamed; \"the Boers are here to save us. Marie,\nI will hold the door while I can. If I fall, scramble through the\nwindow--you can do it from the chest beneath--drop to the ground, and\nrun towards the firing. There's a chance for you yet, a good chance.\"\n\n\"And you, you,\" she moaned. \"I would rather die with you.\"\n\n\"Do what I bid you,\" I answered savagely, and bounded forward towards\nthe rocking door.\n\nIt was falling outward, it fell, and on the top of it appeared two great\nsavages waving broad spears. I lifted the pistol, and the bullet that\nhad been meant for Marie's brain scattered that of the first of them,\nand the bullet which had been meant for my heart pierced that of the\nsecond. They both went down dead, there in the doorway.\n\nI snatched up one of their spears and glanced behind me. Marie was\nclimbing on to the chest; I could just see her through the thickening\nsmoke. Another Quabie rushed on. Hans and I received him on the points\nof our assegais, but so fierce was his charge that they went through him\nas though he were nothing, and being but light, both of us were thrown\nbackwards to the ground. I scrambled to my feet again, defenceless now,\nfor the spear was broken in the Kaffir, and awaited the end. Looking\nback once more I saw that Marie had either failed to get through the\nwindow or abandoned the attempt. At any rate she was standing near the\nchest supporting herself by her right hand. In my despair I seized the\nblade end of the broken assegai and dragged it from the body of the\nKaffir, thinking that it would serve to kill her, then turned to do the\ndeed.\n\nBut even as I turned I heard a voice that I knew well shout: \"Do you\nlive, Marie?\" and in the doorway appeared no savage, but Henri Marais.\n\nSlowly I backed before him, for I could not speak, and the last dreadful\neffort of my will seemed to thrust me towards Marie. I reached her and\nthrew my hand that still held the gory blade round her neck. Then as\ndarkness came over me I heard her cry:\n\n\"Don't shoot, father. It is Allan, Allan who has saved my life!\"\n\nAfter that I remember no more. Nor did she for a while, for we both fell\nto the ground senseless.\n\n\nWhen my senses returned to me I found myself lying on the floor of the\nwagon-house in the back yard. Glancing from my half-opened eyes, for\nI was still speechless, I saw Marie, white as a sheet, her hair all\nfalling about her dishevelled dress. She was seated on one of those\nboxes that we put on the front of wagons to drive from, \"voorkissies\"\nthey are called, and as her eyes were watching me I knew that she lived.\nBy her stood a tall and dark young man whom I had never seen before. He\nwas holding her hand and looking at her anxiously, and even then I felt\nangry with him. Also I saw other things; for instance, my old father\nleaning down and looking at _me_ anxiously, and outside in the yard,\nfor there were no doors to the wagon-house, a number of men with guns in\ntheir hands, some of whom I knew and others who were strangers. In the\nshadow, too, against the wall, stood my blood mare with her head hanging\ndown and trembling all over. Not far from her the roan lay upon the\nground, its flank quite red.\n\nI tried to rise and could not, then feeling pain in my left thigh,\nlooked and saw that it was red also. As a matter of fact an assegai had\ngone half through it and hit upon the bone. Although I never felt it at\nthe time, this wound was dealt to me by that great Quabie whom Hans and\nI had received upon our spears, doubtless as he fell. Hans, by the way,\nwas there also, an awful and yet a ludicrous spectacle, for the Quabie\nhad fallen right on the top of him and lain so with results that may,\nbe imagined. There he sat upon the ground, looking upwards, gasping with\nhis fish-like mouth. Each gasp, I remember, fashioned itself into the\nword \"Allemachte!\" that is \"Almighty,\" a favourite Dutch expression.\n\nMarie was the first to perceive that I had come to life again. Shaking\nherself free from the clasp of the young man, she staggered towards me\nand fell upon her knees at my side, muttering words that I could not\ncatch, for they choked in her throat. Then Hans took in the situation,\nand wriggling his unpleasant self to my other side, lifted my hand and\nkissed it. Next my father spoke, saying:\n\n\"Praise be to God, he lives! Allan, my son, I am proud of you; you have\ndone your duty as an Englishman should.\"\n\n\"Had to save my own skin if I could, thank you, father,\" I muttered.\n\n\"Why as an Englishman more than any other sort of man, Mynheer\npr\u00e9dicant?\" asked the tall stranger, speaking in Dutch, although he\nevidently understood our language.\n\n\"The point is one that I will not argue now, sir,\" answered my father,\ndrawing himself up. \"But if what I hear is true, there was a Frenchman\nin that house who did not do his duty; and if you belong to the same\nnation, I apologise to you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir; as it happens, I do, half. The rest of me is\nPortuguese, not English, thank God.\"\n\n\"God is thanked for many things that must surprise Him,\" replied my\nfather in a suave voice.\n\nAt that moment this rather disagreeable conversation, which even then\nboth angered and amused me faintly, came to an end, for the Heer Marais\nentered the place.\n\nAs might have been expected in so excitable a man, he was in a terrible\nstate of agitation. Thankfulness at the escape of his only, beloved\nchild, rage with the Kaffirs who had tried to kill her, and extreme\ndistress at the loss of most of his property--all these conflicting\nemotions boiled together in his breast like antagonistic elements in a\ncrucible.\n\nThe resulting fumes were parti-coloured and overpowering. He rushed up\nto me, blessed and thanked me (for he had learnt something of the story\nof the defence), called me a young hero and so forth, hoping that God\nwould reward me. Here I may remark that _he_ never did, poor man. Then\nhe began to rave at Leblanc, who had brought all this dreadful disaster\nupon his house, saying that it was a judgment on himself for having\nsheltered an atheist and a drunkard for so many years, just because he\nwas French and a man of intellect. Someone, my father as a matter of\nfact, who with all his prejudices possessed a great sense of justice,\nreminded him that the poor Frenchman had expiated, or perchance was now\nexpiating any crimes that he might have committed.\n\nThis turned the stream of his invective on to the Quabie Kaffirs, who\nhad burned part of his house and stolen nearly all his stock, making\nhim from a rich man into a poor one in a single hour. He shouted for\nvengeance on the \"black devils,\" and called on all there to help him\nto recover his beasts and kill the thieves. Most of those present--they\nwere about thirty in all, not counting the Kaffir and Hottentot\nafter-riders--answered that they were willing to attack the Quabies.\nBeing residents in the district, they felt, and, indeed, said, that his\ncase to-day might and probably would be their case to-morrow. Therefore\nthey were prepared to ride at once.\n\nThen it was that my father intervened.\n\n\"Heeren,\" he said, \"it seems to me that before you seek vengeance,\nwhich, as the Book tells us, is the Lord's, it would be well, especially\nfor the Heer Marais, to return thanks for what has been saved to him. I\nmean his daughter, who might now very easily have been dead or worse.\"\n\nHe added that goods came or went according to the chances of fortune,\nbut a beloved human life, once lost, could not be restored. This\nprecious life had been preserved to him, he would not say by man--here\nhe glanced at me--but by the Ruler of the world acting through man.\nPerhaps those present did not quite understand what he (my father) had\nlearned from Hans the Hottentot, that I, his son, had been about to blow\nout the brains of Marie Marais and my own when the sound of the shots\nof those who had been gathered through the warning which I left before\nI rode from the Mission Station, had stayed my hand. He called upon the\nsaid Hans and Marie herself to tell them the story, since I was too weak\nto do so.\n\nThus adjured, the little Hottentot, smothered as he was in blood,\nstood up. In the simple, dramatic style characteristic of his race, he\nnarrated all that had happened since he met the woman on the veld but\nlittle over twelve hours before, till the arrival of the rescue party.\nNever have I seen a tale followed with deeper interest, and when at last\nHans pointed to me lying on the ground and said, \"There is he who did\nthese things which it might be thought no man could do--he, but a boy,\"\neven from those phlegmatic Dutchmen there came a general cheer. But,\nlifting myself upon my hands, I called out:\n\n\"Whatever I did, this poor Hottentot did also, and had it not been for\nhim I could not have done anything--for him and the two good horses.\"\n\nThen they cheered again, and Marie, rising, said:\n\n\"Yes, father; to these two I owe my life.\"\n\nAfter this, my father offered his prayer of thanksgiving in very bad\nDutch--for, having begun to learn it late in life, he never could really\nmaster that language--and the stalwart Boers, kneeling round him, said\n\"Amen.\" As the reader may imagine, the scene, with all its details,\nwhich I will not repeat, was both remarkable and impressive.\n\nWhat followed this prayer I do not very well remember, for I became\nfaint from exhaustion and the loss of blood. I believe, however, that\nthe fire having been extinguished, they removed the dead and wounded\nfrom the unburnt portion of the house and carried me into the little\nroom where Marie and I had gone through that dreadful scene when I went\nwithin an ace of killing her. After this the Boers and Marais's Kaffirs,\nor rather slaves, whom he had collected from where they lived away\nfrom the house, to the number of thirty or forty, started to follow the\ndefeated Quabie, leaving about ten of their number as a guard. Here I\nmay mention that of the seven or eight men who slept in the outbuildings\nand had fought with us, two were killed in the fight and two wounded.\nThe remainder, one way or another, managed to escape unhurt, so that\nin all this fearful struggle, in which we inflicted so terrible a\npunishment upon the Kaffirs, we lost only three slain, including the\nFrenchman, Leblanc.\n\nAs to the events of the next three days I know only what I have been\ntold, for practically during all that time I was off my head from loss\nof blood, complicated with fever brought on by the fearful excitement\nand exertion I had undergone. All I can recall is a vision of Marie\nbending over me and making me take food of some sort--milk or soup, I\nsuppose--for it seems I would touch it from no other hand. Also I had\nvisions of the tall shape of my white-haired father, who, like most\nmissionaries, understood something of surgery and medicine, attending\nto the bandages on my thigh. Afterwards he told me that the spear had\nactually cut the walls of the big artery, but, by good fortune, without\ngoing through them. Another fortieth of an inch and I should have bled\nto death in ten minutes!\n\nOn this third day my mind was brought back from its wanderings by the\nsound of a great noise about the house, above which I heard the voice of\nMarais storming and shouting, and that of my father trying to calm him.\nPresently Marie entered the room, drawing-to behind her a Kaffir karoos,\nwhich served as a curtain, for the door, it will be remembered, had been\ntorn out. Seeing that I was awake and reasonable, she flew to my side\nwith a little cry of joy, and, kneeling down, kissed me on the forehead.\n\n\"You have been very ill, Allan, but I know you will recover now. While\nwe are alone, which,\" she added slowly and with meaning, \"I dare say we\nshall not be much in future, I want to thank you from my heart for all\nthat you did to save me. Had it not been for you, oh! had it not been\nfor you\"--and she glanced at the blood stains on the earthen floor, put\nher hands before her eyes and shuddered.\n\n\"Nonsense, Marie,\" I answered, taking her hand feebly enough, for I was\nvery weak. \"Anyone else would have done as much, even if they did not\nlove you as I do. Let us thank God that it was not in vain. But what is\nall that noise? Have the Quabies come back?\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"No; the Boers have come back from hunting them.\"\n\n\"And did they catch them and recover the cattle?\"\n\n\"Not so. They only found some wounded men, whom they shot, and the body\nof Monsieur Leblanc with his head cut off, taken away with other bits of\nhim for medicine, they say to make the warriors brave. Quabie has burnt\nhis kraal and fled with all his people to join the other Kaffirs in the\nBig Mountains. Not a cow or a sheep did they find, except a few that had\nfallen exhausted, and those had their throats cut. My father wanted to\nfollow them and attack the Red Kaffirs in the mountains, but the others\nwould not go. They said there are thousands of them, and that it would\nbe a mad war, from which not one of them would return alive. He is wild\nwith grief and rage, for, Allan dear, we are almost ruined, especially\nas the British Government are freeing the slaves and only going to give\nus a very small price, not a third of their value. But, hark! he is\ncalling me, and you must not talk much or excite yourself, lest you\nshould be ill again. Now you have to sleep and eat and get strong.\nAfterwards, dear, you may talk\"; and, bending down once more, she\nblessed and kissed me, then rose and glided away.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. HERNANDO PEREIRA\n\n\nSeveral more days passed before I was allowed out of that little\nwar-stained room of which I grew to hate the very sight. I entreated my\nfather to take me into the air, but he would not, saying that he feared\nlest any movement should cause the bleeding to begin again or even the\ncut artery to burst. Moreover, the wound was not healing very well,\nthe spear that caused it having been dirty or perhaps used to skin\ndead animals, which caused some dread of gangrene, that in those days\ngenerally meant death. As it chanced, although I was treated only with\ncold water, for antiseptics were then unknown, my young and healthy\nblood triumphed and no gangrene appeared.\n\nWhat made those days even duller was that during them I saw very little\nof Marie, who now only entered the place in the company of her father.\nOnce I managed to ask her why she did not come oftener and alone. Her\nface grew troubled as she whispered back, \"Because it is not allowed,\nAllan,\" and then without another word left the place.\n\nWhy, I wondered to myself, was it not allowed, and an answer sprang\nup in my mind. Doubtless it was because of that tall young man who had\nargued with my father in the wagon-house. Marie had never spoken to me\nof him, but from the Hottentot Hans and my father I managed to collect a\ngood deal of information concerning him and his business.\n\nIt appeared that he was the only child of Henri Marais's sister, who\nmarried a Portuguese from Delagoa Bay of the name of Pereira, who had\ncome to the Cape Colony to trade many years before and settled there.\nBoth he and his wife were dead, and their son, Hernando, Marie's cousin,\nhad inherited all their very considerable wealth.\n\nIndeed, now I remembered having heard this Hernando, or Hernan, as the\nBoers called him for short, spoken of in past years by the Heer Marais\nas the heir to great riches, since his father had made a large fortune\nby trading in wine and spirits under some Government monopoly which he\nheld. Often he had been invited to visit Maraisfontein, but his parents,\nwho doted on him and lived in one of the settled districts not far from\nCape Town, would never allow him to travel so far from them into these\nwild regions.\n\nSince their death, however, things had changed. It appeared that on the\ndecease of old Pereira the Governor of the Colony had withdrawn the wine\nand spirit monopoly, which he said was a job and a scandal, an act that\nmade Hernando Pereira very angry, although he needed no more money, and\nhad caused him to throw himself heart and soul into the schemes of the\ndisaffected Boers. Indeed, he was now engaged as one of the organisers\nof the Great Trek which was in contemplation. In fact, it had already\nbegun, into the partially explored land beyond the borders of the\nColony, where the Dutch farmers proposed to set up dominions of their\nown.\n\nThat was the story of Hernando Pereira, who was to be--nay, who had\nalready become--my rival for the hand of the sweet and beautiful Marie\nMarais.\n\nOne night when my father and I were alone in the little room where\nhe slept with me, and he had finished reading his evening portion of\nScripture aloud, I plucked up my courage to tell him that I loved Marie\nand wished to marry her, and that we had plighted our troth during the\nattack of the Kaffirs on the stead.\n\n\"Love and war indeed!\" he said, looking at me gravely, but showing no\nsign of surprise, for it appeared that he was already acquainted with\nour secret. This was not wonderful, for he informed me afterwards that\nduring my delirium I had done nothing except rave of Marie in the most\nendearing terms. Also Marie herself, when I was at my worst, had burst\ninto tears before him and told him straight out that she loved me.\n\n\"Love and war indeed!\" he repeated, adding kindly, \"My poor boy, I fear\nthat you have fallen into great trouble.\"\n\n\"Why, father?\" I asked. \"Is it wrong that we should love each other?\"\n\n\"Not wrong, but, in the circumstances, quite natural--I should\nhave foreseen that it was sure to happen. No, not wrong, but most\nunfortunate. To begin with, I do not wish to see you marry a foreigner\nand become mixed up with these disloyal Boers. I hoped that one day, a\ngood many years hence, for you are only a boy, Allan, you would find an\nEnglish wife, and I still hope it.\"\n\n\"Never!\" I ejaculated.\n\n\"Never is a long word, Allan, and I dare say that what you are so sure\nis impossible will happen after all,\" words that made me angry enough at\nthe time, though in after years I often thought of them.\n\n\"But,\" he went on, \"putting my own wishes, perhaps prejudices, aside,\nI think your suit hopeless. Although Henri Marais likes you well enough\nand is grateful to you just now because you have saved the daughter whom\nhe loves, you must remember that he hates us English bitterly. I believe\nthat he would almost as soon see his girl marry a half-caste as an\nEnglishman, and especially a poor Englishman, as you are, and unless you\ncan make money, must remain. I have little to leave you, Allan.\"\n\n\"I might make money, father, out of ivory, for instance. You know I am a\ngood shot.\"\n\n\"Allan, I do not think you will ever make much money, it is not in your\nblood; or, if you do, you will not keep it. We are an old race, and I\nknow our record, up to the time of Henry VIII. at any rate. Not one of\nus was ever commercially successful. Let us suppose, however, that you\nshould prove yourself the exception to the rule, it can't be done at\nonce, can it? Fortunes don't grow in a night, like mushrooms.\"\n\n\"No, I suppose not, father. Still, one might have some luck.\"\n\n\"Possibly. But meanwhile you have to fight against a man who has the\nluck, or rather the money in his pocket.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked, sitting up.\n\n\"I mean Hernando Pereira, Allan, Marais's nephew, who they say is one of\nthe richest men in the Colony. I know that he wishes to marry Marie.\"\n\n\"How do you know it, father?\"\n\n\"Because Marais told me so this afternoon, probably with a purpose.\nHe was struck with her beauty when he first saw her after your escape,\nwhich he had not done since she was a child, and as he stopped to guard\nthe house while the rest went after the Quabies--well, you can guess.\nSuch things go quickly with these Southern men.\"\n\nI hid my face in the pillow, biting my lips to keep back the groan\nthat was ready to burst from them, for I felt the hopelessness of the\nsituation. How could I compete with this rich and fortunate man, who\nnaturally would be favoured of my betrothed's father? Then on the\nblackness of my despair rose a star of hope. I could not, but perchance\nMarie might. She was very strong-natured and very faithful. She was not\nto be bought, and I doubted whether she could be frightened.\n\n\"Father,\" I said, \"I may never marry Marie, but I don't think that\nHernando Pereira ever will either.\"\n\n\"Why not, my boy?\"\n\n\"Because she loves me, father, and she is not one to change. I believe\nthat she would rather die.\"\n\n\"Then she must be a very unusual sort of woman. Still, it may be so; the\nfuture will tell to those who live to see it. I can only pray and trust\nthat whatever happens will be for the best for both of you. She is a\nsweet girl and I like her well, although she may be Boer--or French. And\nnow, Allan, we have talked enough, and you had better go to sleep. You\nmust not excite yourself, you know, or it may set up new inflammation in\nthe wound.\"\n\n\"Go to sleep. Must not excite yourself.\" I kept muttering those words\nfor hours, serving them up in my mind with a spice of bitter thought. At\nlast torpor, or weakness, overcame me, and I fell into a kind of net of\nbad dreams which, thank Heaven! I have now forgotten. Yet when certain\nevents happened subsequently I always thought, and indeed still think,\nthat these or something like them, had been a part of those evil dreams.\n\nOn the morning following this conversation I was at length allowed to be\ncarried to the stoep, where they laid me down, wrapped in a very\ndirty blanket, upon a rimpi-strung bench or primitive sofa. When I had\nsatisfied my first delight at seeing the sun and breathing the fresh\nair, I began to study my surroundings. In front of the house, or what\nremained of it, so arranged that the last of them at either end we made\nfast to the extremities of the stoep, was arranged an arc of wagons,\nplaced as they are in a laager and protected underneath by earth thrown\nup in a mound and by boughs of the mimosa thorn. Evidently these wagons,\nin which the guard of Boers and armed natives who still remained on\nthe place slept at night, were set thus as a defence against a possible\nattack by the Quabies or other Kaffirs.\n\nDuring the daytime, however, the centre wagon was drawn a little on one\nside to leave a kind of gate. Through this opening I saw that a long\nwall, also semicircular, had been built outside of them, enclosing a\nspace large enough to contain at night all the cattle and horses that\nwere left to the Heer Marais, together with those of his friends, who\nevidently did not wish to see their oxen vanish into the depths of the\nmountains. In the middle of this extemporised kraal was a long, low\nmound, which, as I learned afterwards, contained the dead who fell\nin the attack on the house. The two slaves who had been killed in the\ndefence were buried in the little garden that Marie had made, and the\nheadless body of Leblanc in a small walled place to the right of the\nstead, where lay some of its former owners and one or two relatives of\nthe Heer Marais, including his wife.\n\nWhilst I was noting these things Marie appeared at the end of the\nveranda, having come round the burnt part of the house, followed by\nHernan Pereira. Catching sight of me, she ran to the side of my couch\nwith outstretched arms as though she intended to embrace me. Then\nseeming to remember, stopped suddenly at my side, coloured to her hair,\nand said in an embarrassed voice:\n\n\"Oh, Heer Allan\"--she had never called me Heer in her life before--\"I am\nso glad to find you out! How have you been getting on?\"\n\n\"Pretty well, I thank you,\" I answered, biting my lips, \"as you would\nhave learnt, Marie, had you come to see me.\"\n\nNext moment I was sorry for the words, for I saw her eyes fill with\ntears and her breast shake with something like a sob. However, it was\nPereira and not Marie who answered, for at the moment I believe she\ncould not speak.\n\n\"My good boy,\" he said in a pompous, patronising way and in English,\nwhich he knew perfectly, \"I think that my cousin has had plenty to do\ncaring for all these people during the last few days without running to\nlook at the cut in your leg. However, I am glad to hear from your worthy\nfather that it is almost well and that you will soon be able to play\ngames again, like others of your age.\"\n\nNow it was my turn to be unable to speak and to feel my eyes fill with\ntears, tears of rage, for remember that I was still very feeble. But\nMarie spoke for me.\n\n\"Yes, Cousin Hernan,\" she said in a cold voice, \"thank God the Heer\nAllan Quatermain will soon be able to play games again, such bloody\ngames as the defence of Maraisfontein with eight men against all the\nQuabie horde. Then Heaven help those who stand in front of his rifle,\"\nand she glanced at the mound that covered the dead Kaffirs, many of\nwhom, as a matter of fact, I had killed.\n\n\"Oh! no offence, no offence, Marie,\" said Pereira in his smooth, rich\nvoice. \"I did not want to laugh at your young friend, who doubtless is\nas brave as they say all Englishmen are, and who fought well when he was\nlucky enough to have the chance of protecting you, my dear cousin. But\nafter all, you know, he is not the only one who can hold a gun straight,\nas you seem to think, which I shall be happy to prove to him in a\nfriendly fashion when he is stronger.\"\n\nHere he stepped forward a pace and looked down at me, then added with a\nlaugh, \"Allemachte! I fear that won't be just at present. Why, the lad\nlooks as though one might blow him away like a feather.\"\n\nStill I said nothing, only glanced up at this tall and splendid man\nstanding above me in his fine clothes, for he was richly dressed as the\nfashion of the time went, with his high colouring, broad shoulders, and\nface full of health and vigour. Mentally I compared him with myself,\nas I was after my fever and loss of blood, a poor, white-faced rat of\na lad, with stubbly brown hair on my head and only a little down on my\nchin, with arms like sticks, and a dirty blanket for raiment. How could\nI compare with him in any way? What chance had I against this opulent\nbully who hated me and all my race, and in whose hands, even if I were\nwell, I should be nothing but a child?\n\nAnd yet, and yet as I lay there humiliated and a mock, an answer came\ninto my mind, and I felt that whatever might be the case with my outward\nform; in spirit, in courage, in determination and in ability, in all,\nin short, that really makes a man, I was more than Pereira's equal. Yes,\nand that by the help of these qualities, poor as I was and frail as I\nseemed to be, I would beat him at the last and keep for myself what I\nhad won, the prize of Marie's love.\n\nSuch were the thoughts which passed through me, and I think that\nsomething of the tenor of them communicated itself to Marie, who often\ncould read my heart before my lips spoke. At any rate, her demeanour\nchanged. She drew herself up. Her fine nostrils expanded and a proud\nlook came into her dark eyes, as she nodded her head and murmured in a\nvoice so low that I think I alone caught her words:\n\n\"Yes, yes, have no fear.\"\n\nPereira was speaking again (he had turned aside to strike the steel of\nhis tinder-box, and was now blowing the spark to a glow before lighting\nhis big pipe).\n\n\"By the way, Heer Allan,\" he said, \"that is a very good mare of yours.\nShe seems to have done the distance between the Mission Station and\nMaraisfontein in wonderful time, as, for the matter of that, the\nroan did too. I have taken a fancy to her, after a gallop on her back\nyesterday just to give her some exercise, and although I don't know that\nshe is quite up to my weight, I'll buy her.\"\n\n\"The mare is not for sale, Heer Pereira,\" I said, speaking for the first\ntime, \"and I do not remember giving anyone leave to exercise her.\"\n\n\"No, your father did, or was it that ugly little beast of a Hottentot?\nI forget which. As for her not being for sale--why, in this world\neverything is for sale, at a price. I'll give you--let me see--oh,\nwhat does the money matter when one has plenty? I'll give you a hundred\nEnglish pounds for that mare; and don't you think me a fool. I tell you\nI mean to get it back, and more, at the great races down in the south.\nNow what do you say?\"\n\n\"I say that the mare is not for sale, Heer Pereira.\" Then a thought\nstruck me, or an inspiration, and, as has always been my fashion, I\nacted on it at once. \"But,\" I added slowly, \"if you like, when I am a\nbit stronger I'll shoot you a match for her, you staking your hundred\npounds and I staking the mare.\"\n\nPereira burst out laughing.\n\n\"Here, friends,\" he called to some of the Boers who were strolling up\nto the house for their morning coffee. \"This little Englishman wants to\nshoot a match with me, staking that fine mare of his against a hundred\npounds British; against me, Hernando Pereira, who have won every prize\nat shooting that ever I entered for. No, no, friend Allan, I am not a\nthief, I will not rob you of your mare.\"\n\nNow among those Boers chanced to be the celebrated Heer Pieter Retief,\na very fine man of high character, then in the prime of life, and\nof Huguenot descent like Heer Marais. He had been appointed by the\nGovernment one of the frontier commandants, but owing to some quarrel\nwith the Lieutenant-Governor, Sir Andries Stockenstrom, had recently\nresigned that office, and at this date was engaged in organizing the\ntrek from the Colony. I now saw Retief for the first time, and ah! then\nlittle did I think how and where I should see him for the last. But all\nthat is a matter of history, of which I shall have to tell later.\n\nNow, while Pereira was mocking and bragging of his prowess, Pieter\nRetief looked at me, and our eyes met.\n\n\"Allemachte!\" he exclaimed, \"is that the young man who, with half a\ndozen miserable Hottentots and slaves, held this stead for five hours\nagainst all the Quabie tribe and kept them out?\"\n\nSomebody said that it was, remarking that I had been about to shoot\nMarie Marais and myself when help came.\n\n\"Then, Heer Allan Quatermain,\" said Retief, \"give me your hand,\" and he\ntook my poor wasted fingers in his big palm, adding, \"Your father must\nbe proud of you to-day, as I should be if I had such a son. God in\nHeaven! where will you stop if you can go so far while you are yet a\nboy? Friends, since I came here yesterday I have got the whole story\nfor myself from the Kaffirs and from this 'mooi meisje'\" (pretty young\nlady), and he nodded towards Marie. \"Also I have gone over the ground\nand the house, and have seen where each man fell--it is easy by the\nblood marks--most of them shot by yonder Englishman, except one of the\nlast three, whom he killed with a spear. Well, I tell you that never\nin all my experience have I known a better arranged or a more finely\ncarried out defence against huge odds. Perhaps the best part of it,\ntoo, was the way in which this young lion acted on the information he\nreceived and the splendid ride he made from the Mission Station. Again I\nsay that his father should be proud of him.\"\n\n\"Well, if it comes to that, I am, mynheer,\" said my father, who just\nthen joined us after his morning walk, \"although I beg you to say no\nmore lest the lad should grow vain.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" replied Retief, \"fellows of his stamp are not vain; it is your\nbig talkers who are vain,\" and he glanced out of the corner of his\nshrewd eye at Pereira, \"your turkey cocks with all their tails spread.\nI think this little chap must be such another as that great sailor of\nyours--what do you call him, Nelson?--who beat the French into frothed\neggs and died to live for ever. He was small, too, they say, and weak in\nthe stomach.\"\n\nI must confess I do not think that praise ever sounded sweeter in my\nears than did these words of the Commandant Retief, uttered as they were\njust when I felt crushed to the dirt. Moreover, as I saw by Marie's and,\nI may add, by my father's face, there were other ears to which they were\nnot ungrateful. The Boers also, brave and honest men enough, evidently\nappreciated them, for they said:\n\n\"Ja! ja! das ist recht\" (That is right).\n\nOnly Pereira turned his broad back and busied himself with relighting\nhis pipe, which had gone out.\n\nThen Retief began again.\n\n\"What is it you were calling us to listen to, Mynheer Pereira? That this\nHeer Allan Quatermain had offered to shoot you a match? Well, why not?\nIf he can hit Kaffirs running at him with spears, as he has done, he may\nbe able to hit other things also. You say that you won't rob him of his\nmoney--no, it was his beautiful horse--because you have taken so many\nprizes shooting at targets. But did _you_ ever hit a Kaffir running at\n_you_ with an assegai, mynheer, you who live down there where everything\nis safe? If so, I never heard of it.\"\n\nPereira answered that he did not understand me to propose a shooting\nmatch at Kaffirs charging with assegais, but at something else--he knew\nnot what.\n\n\"Quite so,\" said Retief. \"Well, Mynheer Allan, what is it that you do\npropose?\"\n\n\"That we should stand in the great kloof between the two _vleis_\nyonder--the Heer Marais knows the place--when the wild geese flight over\nan hour before sunset, and that he who brings down six of them in the\nfewest shots shall win the match.\"\n\n\"If our guns are loaded with loopers that will not be difficult,\" said\nPereira.\n\n\"With loopers you would seldom kill a bird, mynheer,\" I replied, \"for\nthey come over from seventy to a hundred yards up. No, I mean with\nrifles.\"\n\n\"Allemachte!\" broke in a Boer; \"you will want plenty of ammunition to\nhit a goose at that height with a bullet.\"\n\n\"That is my offer,\" I said, \"to which I add this, that when twenty shots\nhave been fired by each man, he who has killed the most birds wins, even\nif he has not brought down the full six. Does the Heer Pereira accept?\nIf so, I will venture to match myself against him, although he has won\nso many prizes.\"\n\nThe Heer Pereira seemed extremely doubtful; so doubtful, indeed, that\nthe Boers began to laugh at him. In the end he grew rather angry, and\nsaid that he was willing to shoot me at bucks or swallows, or fireflies,\nor anything else I liked.\n\n\"Then let it be at geese,\" I answered, \"since it is likely to be\nsometime before I am strong enough to ride after buck or other wild\nthings.\"'\n\nSo the terms of the match were formally written down by Marie, as my\nfather, although he took a keen sporting interest in the result, would\nhave nothing to do with what he called a \"wager for money,\" and, except\nmyself, there was no one else present with sufficient scholarship to\npen a long document. Then we both signed them, Hernan Pereira not very\nwillingly, I thought; and if my recovery was sufficiently rapid, the\ndate was fixed for that day week. In case of any disagreement, the Heer\nRetief, who was staying at Maraisfontein, or in its neighbourhood, for a\nwhile, was appointed referee and stakeholder. It was also arranged that\nneither of us should visit the appointed place, or shoot at the geese\nbefore the match. Still we were at liberty to practise as much as we\nliked at anything else in the interval and to make use of any kind of\nrifle that suited us best.\n\nBy the time that these arrangements were finished, feeling quite tired\nwith all the emotions of the morning, I was carried back to my room.\nHere my midday meal, cooked by Marie, was brought to me. As I finished\neating it, for the fresh air had given me an appetite, my father came\nin, accompanied by the Heer Marais, and began to talk to me. Presently\nthe latter asked me kindly enough if I thought I should be sufficiently\nstrong to trek back to the station that afternoon in an ox-cart with\nsprings to it and lying at full length upon a hide-strung \"cartel\" or\nmattress.\n\nI answered, \"Certainly,\" as I should have done had I been at the point\nof death, for I saw that he wished to be rid of me.\n\n\"The fact is, Allan,\" he said awkwardly, \"I am not inhospitable as you\nmay think, especially towards one to whom I owe so much. But you and my\nnephew, Hernan, do not seem to get on very well together, and, as you\nmay guess, having just been almost beggared, I desire no unpleasantness\nwith the only rich member of my family.\"\n\nI replied I was sure I did not wish to be the cause of any. It seemed\nto me, however, that the Heer Pereira wished to make a mock of me and to\nbring it home to me what a poor creature I was compared to himself--I a\nmere sick boy who was worth nothing.\n\n\"I know,\" said Marais uneasily, \"my nephew has been too fortunate in\nlife, and is somewhat overbearing in his manner. He does not remember\nthat the battle is not always to the strong or the race to the swift, he\nwho is young and rich and handsome, a spoiled child from the first. I\nam sorry, but what I cannot help I must put up with. If I cannot have my\nmealies cooked, I must eat them green. Also, Allan, have you never heard\nthat jealousy sometimes makes people rude and unjust?\" and he looked at\nme meaningly.\n\nI made no answer, for when one does not quite know what to say it is\noften best to remain silent, and he went on:\n\n\"I am vexed to hear of this foolish shooting match which has been\nentered into without my knowledge or consent. If he wins he will only\nlaugh at you the more, and if you win he will be angry.\"\n\n\"It was not my fault, mynheer,\" I answered. \"He wanted to force me\nto sell the mare, which he had been riding without my leave, and kept\nbragging about his marksmanship. So at last I grew cross and challenged\nhim.\"\n\n\"No wonder, Allan; I do not blame you. Still, you are silly, for it will\nnot matter to him if he loses his money; but that beautiful mare is your\newe-lamb, and I should be sorry to see you parted from a beast which has\ndone us so good a turn. Well, there it is; perhaps circumstances may yet\nput an end to this trial; I hope so.\"\n\n\"I hope they won't,\" I answered stubbornly.\n\n\"I dare say you do, being sore as a galled horse just now. But listen,\nAllan, and you, too, pr\u00e9dicant Quatermain; there are other and more\nimportant reasons than this petty squabble why I should be glad if you\ncould go away for a while. I must take counsel with my countrymen about\ncertain secret matters which have to do with our welfare and future,\nand, of course they would not like it if all the while there were two\nEnglishmen on the place, whom they might think were spies.\"\n\n\"Say no more, Heer Marais,\" broke in my father hotly; \"still less should\nwe like to be where we are not wanted or are looked upon with suspicion\nfor the crime of being English. By God's blessing, my son has been able\nto do some service to you and yours, but now that is all finished and\nforgotten. Let the cart you are so kind as to lend us be inspanned. We\nwill go at once.\"\n\nThen Henri Marais, who was a gentleman at bottom, although, even\nin those early days, violent and foolish when excited or under the\ninfluence of his race prejudices, began to apologise quite humbly,\nassuring my father that he forgot nothing and meant no offence. So they\npatched the matter up, and an hour later we started.\n\nAll the Boers came to see us off, giving me many kind words and saying\nhow much they looked forward to meeting me again on the following\nThursday. Pereira, who was among them, was also very genial, begging me\nto be sure and get well, since he did not wish to beat one who was still\ncrippled, even at a game of goose shooting. I answered that I would do\nmy best; as for my part, I did not like being beaten it any game which\nI had set my heart on winning, whether it were little or big. Then\nI turned my head, for I was lying on my back all this time, to bid\ngood-bye to Marie, who had slipped out of the house into the yard where\nthe cart was.\n\n\"Good-bye, Allan,\" she said, giving me her hand and a look from her\neyes that I trusted was not seen. Then, under pretence of arranging the\nkaross which was over me, she bent down and whispered swiftly:\n\n\"Win that match if you love me. I shall pray God that you may every\nnight, for it will be an omen.\"\n\nI think the whisper was heard, though not the words, for I saw Pereira\nbite his lip and make a movement as though to interrupt her. But Pieter\nRetief thrust his big form in front of him rather rudely, and said with\none of his hearty laughs:\n\n\"Allemachte! friend, let the missje wish a good journey to the young\nfellow who saved her life.\"\n\nNext moment Hans, the Hottentot, screamed at the oxen in the usual\nfashion, and we rolled away through the gate.\n\nBut oh! if I had liked the Heer Retief before, now I loved him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. THE SHOOTING MATCH\n\n\nMy journey back to the Mission Station was a strange contrast to that\nwhich I had made thence a few days before. Then, the darkness, the swift\nmare beneath me rushing through it like a bird, the awful terror in my\nheart lest I should be too late, as with wild eyes I watched the paling\nstars and the first gathering grey of dawn. Now, the creaking of the\nox-cart, the familiar veld, the bright glow of the peaceful sunlight,\nand in my heart a great thankfulness, and yet a new terror lest the pure\nand holy love which I had won should be stolen away from me by force or\nfraud.\n\nWell, as the one matter had been in the hand of God, so was the other,\nand with that knowledge I must be content. The first trial had ended in\ndeath and victory. How would the second end? I wondered, and those words\nseemed to jumble themselves up in my mind and shape a sentence that it\ndid not conceive. It was: \"In the victory that is death,\" which, when\nI came to think of it, of course, meant nothing. How victory could be\ndeath I did not understand--at any rate, at that time, I who was but a\nlad of small experience.\n\nAs we trekked along comfortably enough, for the road was good and the\ncart, being on springs, gave my leg no pain, I asked my father what he\nthought that the Heer Marais had meant when he told us that the Boers\nhad business at Maraisfontein, during which our presence as Englishmen\nwould not be agreeable to them.\n\n\"Meant, Allan? He meant that these traitorous Dutchmen are plotting\nagainst their sovereign, and are afraid lest we should report their\ntreason. Either they intend to rebel because of that most righteous\nact, the freeing of the slaves, and because we will not kill out all the\nKaffirs with whom they chance to quarrel, or to trek from the Colony.\nFor my part I think it will be the latter, for, as you have heard, some\nparties have already gone; and, unless I am mistaken, many more mean\nto follow, Marais and Retief and that plotter, Pereira, among them.\nLet them go; I say, the sooner the better, for I have no doubt that the\nEnglish flag will follow them in due course.\"\n\n\"I hope that they won't,\" I answered with a nervous laugh; \"at any rate,\nuntil I have won back my mare.\" (I had left her in Retief's care as\nstakeholder, until the match should be shot off.)\n\nFor the rest of that two and a half hours' trek my father, looking very\ndignified and patriotic, declaimed to me loudly about the bad behaviour\nof the Boers, who hated and traduced missionaries, loathed and\nabominated British rule and permanent officials, loved slavery and\nkilled Kaffirs whenever they got the chance. I listened to him politely,\nfor it was not wise to cross my parent when he was in that humour. Also,\nhaving mixed a great deal with the Dutch, I knew that there was another\nside to the question, namely, that the missionaries sometimes traduced\nthem (as, in fact, they did), and that British rule, or rather,\nparty government, played strange tricks with the interests of distant\ndependencies. That permanent officials and im-permanent ones too--such\nas governors full of a little brief authority--often misrepresented and\noppressed them. That Kaffirs, encouraged by the variegated policy of\nthese party governments and their servants, frequently stole their\nstock; and if they found a chance, murdered them with their women and\nchildren, as they had tried to do at Maraisfontein; though there, it is\ntrue, they had some provocation. That British virtue had liberated the\nslaves without paying their owners a fair price for them, and so forth.\n\nBut, to tell the truth, it was not of these matters of high policy,\nwhich were far enough away from a humble youth like myself, that I was\nthinking. What appealed to me and made my heart sick was the reflection\nthat if Henri Marais and his friends trekked, Marie Marais must perforce\ntrek with them; and that whereas I, an Englishman, could not be of that\nadventurous company, Hernando Pereira both could and would.\n\n\nOn the day following our arrival home, what between the fresh air,\nplenty of good food, for which I found I had an appetite, and liberal\ndoses of Pontac--a generous Cape wine that is a kind of cross between\nport and Burgundy--I found myself so much better that I was able to hop\nabout the place upon a pair of crutches which Hans improvised for me\nout of Kaffir sticks. Next morning, my improvement continuing at a rapid\nrate, I turned my attention seriously to the shooting match, for which I\nhad but five days to prepare.\n\nNow it chanced that some months before a young Englishman of good\nfamily--he was named the Honourable Vavasseur Smyth--who had accompanied\nan official relative to the Cape Colony, came our way in search of\nsport, of which I was able to show him a good deal of a humble kind.\nHe had brought with him, amongst other weapons, what in those days was\nconsidered a very beautiful hair-triggered small-bore rifle fitted with\na nipple for percussion caps, then quite a new invention. It was by a\nmaker of the name of J. Purdey, of London, and had cost quite a large\nsum because of the perfection of its workmanship. When the Honourable\nV. Smyth--of whom I have never heard since--took his leave of us on\nhis departure for England, being a generous-hearted young fellow, as a\nsouvenir of himself, he kindly presented me with this rifle,* which I\nstill have.\n\n     [*--This single-barrelled percussion-cap rifle described by\n     Allan Quatermain, which figures so prominently in the\n     history of this epoch of his life, has been sent to me by\n     Mr. Curtis, and is before me as I write. It was made in the\n     year 1835 by J. Purdey, of 314 1/2, Oxford Street, London,\n     and is a beautiful piece of workmanship of its kind. Without\n     the ramrod, which is now missing, it weighs only 5 lbs. 3\n     3/4 oz. The barrel is octagonal, and the rifled bore,\n     designed to take a spherical bullet, is 1/2 in. in diameter.\n     The hammer can be set to safety on the half-cock by means of\n     a catch behind it.\n\n     Another peculiarity of the weapon, one that I have never\n     seen before, is that by pressing on the back of the trigger\n     the ordinary light pull of the piece is so reduced that the\n     merest touch suffices to fire it, thus rendering it hair-\n     triggered in the fullest sense of the word.\n\n     It has two flap-sights marked for 150 and 200 yards, in\n     addition to the fixed sight designed for firing at 100\n     yards.\n\n     On the lock are engraved a stag and a doe, the first lying\n     down and the second standing.\n\n     Of its sort and period, it is an extraordinarily well-made\n     and handy gun, finished with horn at the end of what is now\n     called the tongue, and with the stock cut away so as to\n     leave a raised cushion against which the cheek of the\n     shooter rests.\n\n     What charge it took I do not know, but I should imagine from\n     2 1/2 to 3 drachms of powder. It is easy to understand that\n     in the hands of Allan Quatermain this weapon, obsolete as it\n     is to-day, was capable of great things within the limits of\n     its range, and that the faith he put in it at the trial of\n     skill at the Groote Kloof, and afterwards in the fearful\n     ordeal of the shooting of the vultures on the wing, upon the\n     Mount of Slaughter, when the lives of many hung upon his\n     marksmanship, was well justified. This, indeed, is shown by\n     the results in both cases.\n\n     In writing of this rifle, Messrs. Purdey informed me that\n     copper percussion caps were experimented with by Colonel\n     Forsyth in 1820, and that their firm sold them in 1824, at a\n     cost of \u00a31 15s. per 1,000, although their use did not become\n     general until some years later.--THE EDITOR.]\n\nThat was about six months earlier than the time of which I write, and\nduring those months I had often used this rifle for the shooting of\ngame, such as blesbuck and also of bustards. I found it to be a weapon\nof the most extraordinary accuracy up to a range of about two hundred\nyards, though when I rode off in that desperate hurry for Maraisfontein\nI did not take it with me because it was a single barrel and too small\nin the bore to load with loopers at a pinch. Still, in challenging\nPereira, it was this gun and no other that I determined to use; indeed,\nhad I not owned it I do not think that I should have ventured on the\nmatch.\n\nAs it happened, Mr. Smyth had left me with the rifle a large supply of\nspecially cast bullets and of the new percussion caps, to say nothing of\nsome very fine imported powder. Therefore, having ammunition in plenty,\nI set to work to practise. Seating myself upon a chair in a deep kloof\nnear the station, across which rock pigeons and turtle doves were wont\nto fly in numbers at a considerable height, I began to fire at them as\nthey flashed over me.\n\nNow, in my age, I may say without fear of being set down a boaster, that\nI have one gift, that of marksmanship, which, I suppose, I owe to some\ncurious combination of judgment, quickness of eye, and steadiness of\nhand. I can declare honestly that in my best days I never knew a man who\ncould beat me in shooting at a living object; I say nothing of target\nwork, of which I have little experience. Oddly enough, also, I believe\nthat at this art, although then I lacked the practice which since has\ncome to me in such plenty, I was as good as a youth as I have ever been\nin later days, and, of course, far better than I am now. This I soon\nproved upon the present occasion, for seated there in that kloof, after\na few trials, I found that I could bring down quite a number of even the\nswift, straight-flying rock pigeons as they sped over me, and this, be\nit remembered, not with shot, but with a single bullet, a feat that many\nwould hold to be incredible.\n\nSo the days passed, and I practised, every evening finding me a little\nbetter at this terribly difficult sport. For always I learned more as\nto the exact capacities of my rifle and the allowance that must be made\naccording to the speed of the bird, its distance, and the complications\nof the wind and of the light. During those days, also, I recovered so\nrapidly that at the end of them I was almost in my normal condition, and\ncould walk well with the aid of a single stick.\n\nAt length the eventful Thursday came, and about midday--for I lay in bed\nlate that morning and did not shoot--I drove, or, rather, was driven, in\na Cape cart with two horses to the place known as Groote Kloof or Great\nGully. Over this gorge the wild geese flighted from their \"pans\" or\nfeeding grounds on the high lands above, to other pans that lay some\nmiles below, and thence, I suppose, straight out to the sea coast,\nwhence they returned at dawn.\n\nOn arriving at the mouth of Groote Kloof about four o'clock in the\nafternoon, my father and I were astonished to see a great number of\nBoers assembled there, and among them a certain sprinkling of their\nyounger womankind, who had come on horseback or in carts.\n\n\"Good gracious!\" I said to my father; \"if I had known there was to be\nsuch a fuss as this about a shooting match, I don't think I could have\nfaced it.\"\n\n\"Hum,\" he answered; \"I think there is more in the wind than your match.\nUnless I am much mistaken, it has been made the excuse of a public\nmeeting in a secluded spot, so as to throw the Authorities off the\nscent.\"\n\nAs a matter of fact, my father was quite right. Before we arrived there\nthat day the majority of those Boers, after full and long discussion,\nhad arranged to shake the dust of the Colony off their feet, and find a\nhome in new lands to the north.\n\nPresently we were among them, and I noticed that, one and all, their\nfaces were anxious and preoccupied. Pieter Retief caught sight of me\nbeing helped out of the cart by my father and Hans, whom I had brought\nto load, and for a moment looked puzzled. Evidently his thoughts were\nfar away. Then he remembered and exclaimed in his jolly voice:\n\n\"Why! here is our little Englishman come to shoot off his match like a\nman of his word. Friend Marais, stop talking about your losses\"--this in\na warning voice--\"and give him good day.\"\n\nSo Marais came, and with him Marie, who blushed and smiled, but to my\nmind looked more of a grown woman than ever before; one who had left\ngirlhood behind her and found herself face to face with real life and\nall its troubles. Following her close, very close, as I was quick to\nnotice, was Hernan Pereira. He was even more finely dressed than usual\nand carried in his hand a beautiful new, single-barrelled rifle, also\nfitted to take percussion caps, but, as I thought, of a very large bore\nfor the purpose of goose shooting.\n\n\"So you have got well again,\" he said in a genial voice that yet did not\nring true. Indeed, it suggested to me that he wished I had done nothing\nof the sort. \"Well, Mynheer Allan, here you find me quite ready to shoot\nyour head off.\" (He didn't mean that, though I dare say he was.) \"I\ntell you that the mare is as good as mine, for I have been practising,\nhaven't I, Marie? as the 'aasvogels'\" (that is, vultures) \"round the\nstead know to their cost.\"\n\n\"Yes, Cousin Hernan,\" said Marie, \"you have been practising, but so,\nperhaps, has Allan.\"\n\nBy this time all the company of Boers had collected round us, and began\nto evince a great interest in the pending contest, as was natural among\npeople who rarely had a gun out of their hands, and thought that fine\nshooting was the divinest of the arts. However, they were not allowed\nto stay long, as the Kaffirs said that the geese would begin their\nafternoon flight within about half an hour. So the spectators were all\nrequested to arrange themselves under the sheer cliff of the kloof,\nwhere they could not be seen by the birds coming over them from behind,\nand there to keep silence. Then Pereira and I--I attended by my loader,\nbut he alone, as he said a man at his elbow would bother him--and with\nus Retief, the referee, took our stations about a hundred and fifty\nyards from this face of cliff. Here we screened ourselves as well as\nwe could from the keen sight of the birds behind some tall bushes which\ngrew at this spot.\n\nI seated myself on a camp-stool, which I had brought with me, for my\nleg was still too weak to allow me to stand long, and waited. Presently\nPereira said through Retief that he had a favour to ask, namely, that\nI would allow him to take the first six shots, as the strain of waiting\nmade him nervous. I answered, \"Certainly,\" although I knew well that\nthe object of the request was that he believed that the outpost\ngeese--\"spy-geese\" we called them--which would be the first to arrive,\nwould probably come over low down and slow, whereas those that followed,\nscenting danger, might fly high and fast. This, in fact, proved to be\nthe case, for there is no bird more clever than the misnamed goose.\n\nWhen we had waited about a quarter of an hour Hans said:\n\n\"Hist! Goose comes.\"\n\nAs he spoke, though as yet I could not see the bird, I heard its cry of\n\"Honk, honk\" and the swish of its strong wings.\n\nThen it appeared, an old spur-winged gander, probably the king of the\nflock, flying so low that it only cleared the cliff edge by about twenty\nfeet, and passed over not more than thirty yards up, an easy shot.\nPereira fired, and down it came rather slowly, falling a hundred yards\nor so behind him, while Retief said:\n\n\"One for our side.\"\n\nPereira loaded again, and just as he had capped his rifle three more\ngeese, also flying low, came over, preceded by a number of ducks,\npassing straight above us, as they must do owing to the shape of the gap\nbetween the land waves of the veld above through which they flighted.\nPereira shot, and to my surprise, the second, not the first, bird fell,\nalso a good way behind him.\n\n\"Did you shoot at that goose, or the other, nephew?\" asked Retief.\n\n\"At that one for sure,\" he answered with a laugh.\n\n\"He lies,\" muttered the Hottentot; \"he shot at the first and killed the\nsecond.\"\n\n\"Be silent,\" I answered. \"Who would lie about such a thing?\"\n\nAgain Pereira loaded. By the time that he was ready more geese were\napproaching, this time in a triangle of seven birds, their leader being\nat the point of the triangle, which was flying higher than those that\nhad gone before. He fired, and down came not one bird, but two, namely,\nthe captain and the goose to the right of and a little behind it.\n\n\"Ah! uncle,\" exclaimed Pereira, \"did you see those birds cross each\nother as I pulled? That was a lucky one for me, but I won't count the\nsecond if the Heer Allan objects.\"\n\n\"No, I did not, nephew,\" answered Retief, \"but doubtless they must have\ndone so, or the same bullet could not have pierced both.\"\n\nBoth Hans and I only looked at each other and laughed. Still we said\nnothing.\n\nFrom the spectators under the cliff there came a murmur of\ncongratulation not unmixed with astonishment. Again Pereira loaded,\naimed, and loosed at a rather high goose--it may have been about seventy\nyards in the air. He struck it right enough, for the feathers flew from\nits breast; but to my astonishment the bird, after swooping down as\nthough it were going to fall, recovered itself and flew away straight\nout of sight.\n\n\"Tough birds, these geese!\" exclaimed Pereira. \"They can carry as much\nlead as a sea-cow.\"\n\n\"Very tough indeed,\" answered Retief doubtfully. \"Never before did I see\na bird fly away with an ounce ball through its middle.\"\n\n\"Oh! he will drop dead somewhere,\" replied Pereira as he rammed his\npowder down.\n\nWithin four minutes more Pereira had fired his two remaining shots,\nselecting, as he was entitled to do, low and easy young geese that came\nover him slowly. He killed them both, although the last of them, after\nfalling, waddled along the ground into a tuft of high grass.\n\nNow murmurs of stifled applause broke from the audience, to which\nPereira bowed in acknowledgment.\n\n\"You will have to shoot very well, Mynheer Allan,\" said Retief to me,\n\"if you want to beat that. Even if I rule out one of the two birds that\nfell to a single shot, as I think I shall, Hernan has killed five out of\nsix, which can scarcely be bettered.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered; \"but, mynheer, be so good as to have those geese\ncollected and put upon one side. I don't want them mixed up with mine,\nif I am lucky enough to bring any down.\"\n\nHe nodded, and some Kaffirs were sent to bring in the geese. Several of\nthese, I noted, were still flapping and had to have their necks twisted,\nbut at the time I did not go to look at them. While this was being done\nI called to Retief, and begged him to examine the powder and bullets I\nwas about to use.\n\n\"What's the good?\" he asked, looking at me curiously. \"Powder is powder,\nand a bullet is a bullet.\"\n\n\"None, I dare say. Still, oblige me by looking at them, my uncle.\"\n\nThen at my bidding Hans took six bullets and placed them in his hand,\nbegging him to return them to us as they were wanted.\n\n\"They must be a great deal smaller than Hernan's,\" said Retief, \"who,\nbeing stronger, uses a heavier gun.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered briefly, as Hans put the charge of powder into the\nrifle, and drove home the wad. Then, taking a bullet from Retief's hand,\nhe rammed that down on to the top of it, capped the gun, and handed it\nto me.\n\nBy now the geese were coming thick, for the flight was at its full.\nOnly, either because some of those that had already passed had sighted\nthe Kaffirs collecting the fallen birds and risen--an example which\nthe others noted from afar and followed--or because in an unknown way\nwarning of their danger had been conveyed to them, they were flying\nhigher and faster than the first arrivals.\n\n\"You will have the worst of it, Allan,\" said Retief. \"It should have\nbeen shot and shot about.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" I answered, \"but that can't be helped now.\"\n\nThen I rose from my stool, the rifle in my hand. I had not long to wait,\nfor presently over came a wedge of geese nearly a hundred yards up. I\naimed at the first fellow, holding about eight yards ahead of him to\nallow for his pace, and pressed. Next second I heard the clap of the\nbullet, but alas! it had only struck the outstretched beak, of which\na small portion fell to the ground. The bird itself, after wavering\na second, resumed its place as leader of the squad and passed away\napparently unharmed.\n\n\"Baas, baas,\" whispered Hans as he seized the rifle and began to\nre-load, \"you were too far in front. These big water-birds do not travel\nas fast as the rock pigeons.\"\n\nI nodded, wishing to save my breath. Then, quivering with excitement,\nfor if I missed the next shot the match appeared to be lost, presently I\ntook the rifle from his hand.\n\nScarcely had I done so when a single goose came over quite as high as\nthe others and travelling \"as though the black devil had kicked it,\" as\nRetief said. This time I allowed the same space to compensate for the\nobject's increased speed and pressed.\n\nDown it came like a stone, falling but a little way behind me with its\nhead knocked off.\n\n\"Baas, baas,\" whispered Hans, \"still too far in front. Why aim at the\neye when you have the whole body?\"\n\nAgain I nodded, and at the same time heaved a sigh of relief. At least\nthe match was still alive. Soon a large flight came over, mixed up with\nmallard and widgeon. I took the right-hand angle bird, so that it could\nnot be supposed I had \"browned the lot,\" as here in England they say\nof one who fires at a covey and not at a particular partridge. Down he\ncame, shot straight through the breast. Then I knew that I had got my\nnerve, and felt no more fear.\n\nTo cut a long story short, although two of them were extremely difficult\nand high, one being, I should say, quite a hundred and twenty yards\nabove me, and the other by no means easy, I killed the next three birds\none after the other, and I verily believe could have killed a dozen more\nwithout a miss, for now I was shooting as I had never shot before.\n\n\"Say, nephew Allan,\" asked Retief curiously in the pause between\nthe fifth and sixth shots, \"why do your geese fall so differently to\nHernan's?\"\n\n\"Ask him! don't talk to me,\" I answered, and next instant brought down\nnumber five, the finest shot of the lot.\n\nA sound of wonder and applause came from all the audience, and I saw\nMarie wave a white handkerchief.\n\n\"That's the end,\" said the referee.\n\n\"One minute before you stir,\" I answered. \"I want to shoot at something\nelse that is not in the match, just to see if I can kill two birds with\none bullet like the Heer Pereira.\"\n\nHe granted my request with a nod, holding up his hand to prevent the\naudience from moving, and bidding Pereira, who tried to interrupt, to be\nsilent.\n\nNow, while the match was in progress I had noticed two falcons about\nthe size of the British peregrine wheeling round and round high over the\nkloof, in which doubtless they bred, apparently quite undisturbed by\nthe shooting. Or, perhaps, they had their eyes upon some of the fallen\ngeese. I took the rifle and waited for a long while, till at last my\nopportunity came. I saw that the larger hen falcon was about to cross\ndirectly over the circle of its mate, there being perhaps a distance of\nten yards between them. I aimed; I judged--for a second my mind was a\nkind of calculating machine--the different arcs and speeds of the birds\nmust be allowed for, and the lowest was ninety yards away. Then, with\nsomething like a prayer upon my lips, I pressed while every eye stared\nupwards.\n\nDown came the lower falcon; a pause of half a second, and down came the\nhigher one also, falling dead upon its dead mate!\n\nNow, even from those Boers, who did not love to see an Englishman excel,\nthere broke a shout of acclamation. Never had they beheld such a shot as\nthis; nor in truth had I.\n\n\"Mynheer Retief,\" I said, \"I gave you notice that I intended to try to\nkill both of them, did I not?\"\n\n\"You did. Allemachte! you did! But tell me, Allan Quatermain, are your\neye and hand quite human?\"\n\n\"You must ask my father,\" I answered with a shrug as I sat myself down\nupon my stool and mopped my brow.\n\nThe Boers came up with a rush, Marie flying ahead of them like a\nswallow, and their stout womenfolk waddling behind, and formed a circle\nround us, all talking at once. I did not listen to their conversation,\ntill I heard Pereira, who was engaged in some eye-play with Marie, say\nin a loud voice:\n\n\"Yes, it was pretty, very pretty, but all the same, Uncle Retief, I\nclaim the match, as I shot six geese against five.\"\n\n\"Hans,\" I said, \"bring my geese,\" and they were brought, each with a\nneat hole through it, and laid down near those that Pereira had shot.\n\"Now,\" I said to Retief, \"examine the wounds in these birds, and then\nthat on the second bird which the Heer Pereira killed when he brought\ndown two at once. I think it will be found that his bullet must have\nsplintered.\"\n\nRetief went and studied all the birds, taking them up one by one. Then\nhe threw down the last with a curse and cried in a great voice:\n\n\"Mynheer Pereira, why do you bring shame on us before these two\nEnglishmen? I say that you have been using loopers, or else bullets that\nwere sawn in quarters and glued or tied with thread. Look, look!\" and he\npointed to the wounds, of which in one case there were as many as three\non a single bird.\n\n\"Why not?\" answered Pereira coolly. \"The bargain was that we were to use\nbullets, but it was never said that they should not be cut. Doubtless\nthe Heer Allan's were treated in the same way.\"\n\n\"No,\" I answered, \"when I said that I would shoot with a bullet I meant\na whole bullet, not one that had been sawn in pieces and fixed together\nagain, so that after it left the muzzle it might spread out like shot.\nBut I do not wish to talk about the matter. It is in the hands of the\nHeer Pieter Retief, who will give judgment as it pleases him.\"\n\nNow, much excited argument ensued among the Boers, in the midst of which\nMarie managed to whisper to me unheard:\n\n\"Oh! I am glad, Allan, for whatever they may decide, you won, and the\nomen is good.\"\n\n\"I don't see what geese have to do with omens, sweetheart,\" I\nanswered--\"that is, since the time of the ancient Romans. Anyhow,\nI should say that the omens are bad, for there is going to be a row\npresently.\"\n\nJust then Retief put up his hand, calling out:\n\n\"Silence! I have decided. The writing of the match did not say that the\nbullets were not to be cut, and therefore Hernan Pereira's birds must\ncount. But that writing does say that any bird accidentally killed\nshould not count, and therefore one goose must be subtracted from\nPereira's total, which leaves the two shooters equal. So either the\nmatch is dead or, since the geese have ceased to come, it must be shot\noff another day.\"\n\n\"Oh! if there is any question,\" said Pereira, who felt that public\nopinion was much against him, \"let the Englishman take the money. I dare\nsay that he needs it, as the sons of missionaries are not rich.\"\n\n\"There is no question,\" I said, \"since, rich or poor, not for a thousand\npounds would I shoot again against one who plays such tricks. Keep your\nmoney, Mynheer Pereira, and I will keep my mare. The umpire has said\nthat the match is dead, so everything is finished.\"\n\n\"Not quite,\" interrupted Retief, \"for I have a word to say. Friend\nAllan, you have played fair, and I believe that there is no one who can\nshoot like you in Africa.\"\n\n\"That is so,\" said the audience of Boers.\n\n\"Mynheer Pereira,\" went on Retief, \"although you, too, are a fine shot,\nas is well known, I believe that had you played fair also you would have\nbeen beaten, but as it is you have saved your hundred pounds. Mynheer\nPereira,\" he added in a great voice, \"you are a cheat, who have brought\ndisgrace upon us Boers, and for my part I never want to shake your hand\nagain.\"\n\nNow, at these outspoken words, for when his indignation was aroused\nRetief was no measurer of language, Pereira's high-coloured face went\nwhite as a sheet.\n\n\"Mein Gott, mynheer,\" he said, \"I am minded to make you answer for such\ntalk,\" and his hand went to the knife at his girdle.\n\n\"What!\" shouted Retief, \"do you want another shooting match? Well, if\nso I am ready with whole bullets or with split ones. None shall say that\nPieter Retief was afraid of any man, and, least of all, of one who is\nnot ashamed to try to steal a prize as a hyena steals a bone from a\nlion. Come on, Hernan Pereira, come on!\"\n\nNow, I am sure I cannot say what would have happened, although I\nam quite certain that Pereira had no stomach for a duel with the\nredoubtable Retief, a man whose courage was as proverbial throughout the\nland as was his perfect uprightness of character. At any rate, seeing\nthat things looked very black, Henri Marais, who had been listening to\nthis altercation with evident annoyance, stepped forward and said:\n\n\"Mynheer Retief and nephew Hernan, you are both my guests, and I will\nnot permit quarrelling over this foolishness, especially as I am sure\nthat Hernan never intended to cheat, but only to do what he thought was\nallowed. Why should he, who is one of the finest shots in the Colony,\nthough it may be that young Allan Quatermain here is even better? Will\nyou not say so, too, friend Retief, especially just now when it is\nnecessary that we should all be as brothers?\" he added pleadingly.\n\n\"No,\" thundered Retief, \"I will not tell a lie to please you or anyone.\"\n\nThen, seeing that the commandant was utterly uncompromising, Marais went\nup to his nephew and whispered to him for a while. What he said I do not\nknow. The result of it was, however, that after favouring both Retief\nand myself with an angry scowl, Pereira turned and walked to where\nhis horse stood, mounted it, and rode off, followed by two Hottentot\nafter-riders.\n\nThat was the last I saw of Hernan Pereira for a long while to come, and\nheartily do I wish that it had been the last I ever saw of him. But this\nwas not to be.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. THE PARTING\n\n\nThe Boers, who ostensibly had come to the kloof to see the shooting\nmatch, although, in fact, for a very different purpose, now began to\ndisperse. Some of them rode straight away, while some went to wagons\nwhich they had outspanned at a distance, and trekked off to their\nseparate homes. I am glad to say that before they left quite a number\nof the best of them came up and congratulated me both on the defence of\nMaraisfontein and on my shooting. Also not a few expressed their views\nconcerning Pereira in very straightforward language.\n\nNow, the arrangement was that my father and I were to sleep that night\nat Marais's stead, returning home on the following morning. But my\nfather, who had been a silent but not unobservant witness of all this\nscene, coming to the conclusion that after what had happened we should\nscarcely be welcome there, and that the company of Pereira was to be\navoided just now, went up to Marais and bade him farewell, saying that\nwe would send for my mare.\n\n\"Not so, not so,\" he answered, \"you are my guests to-night. Also, fear\nnot, Hernan will be away. He has gone a journey upon some business.\"\n\nAs my father hesitated, Marais added: \"Friend, I pray you to come, for I\nhave some important words to say to you, which cannot be said here.\"\n\nThen my father gave way, to my delight and relief. For if he had\nnot, what chance would there have been of my getting some still more\nimportant words with Marie? So having collected the geese and the two\nfalcons, which I proposed to skin for Marie, I was helped into the cart,\nand we drove off, reaching Maraisfontein just as night set in.\n\nThat evening, after we had eaten, Heer Marais asked my father and myself\nto speak with him in the sitting-room. By an afterthought also, or so\nit seemed to me, he told his daughter, who had been clearing away the\ndishes and with whom as yet I had found no opportunity to talk, to come\nin with us and close the door behind her.\n\nWhen all were seated and we men had lit our pipes, though apprehension\nof what was to follow quite took away my taste for smoking, Marais spoke\nin English, which he knew to a certain extent. This was for the benefit\nof my father, who made it a point of honour not to understand Dutch,\nalthough he would answer Marais in that language when _he_ pretended\nnot to understand English. To me he spoke in Dutch, and occasionally in\nFrench to Marie. It was a most curious and polyglot conversation.\n\n\"Young Allan,\" he said, \"and you, daughter Marie, I have heard stories\nconcerning you that, although I never gave you leave to 'opsit'\" (that\nis, to sit up alone at night with candles, according to the Boer fashion\nbetween those who are courting), \"you have been making love to each\nother.\"\n\n\"That is true, mynheer,\" I said. \"I only waited an opportunity to tell\nyou that we plighted our troth during the attack of the Quabies on this\nhouse.\"\n\n\"Allemachte! Allan, a strange time to choose,\" answered Marais, pulling\nat his beard; \"the troth that is plighted in blood is apt to end in\nblood.\"\n\n\"A vain superstition to which I cannot consent,\" interrupted my father.\n\n\"Perhaps so,\" I answered. \"I know not; God alone knows. I only know that\nwe plighted our troth when we thought ourselves about to die, and that\nwe shall keep that troth till death ends it.\"\n\n\"Yes, my father,\" added Marie, leaning forward across the scored\nyellow-wood table, her chin resting on her hand and her dark, buck-like\neyes looking him in the face. \"Yes, my father, that is so, as I have\ntold you already.\"\n\n\"And I tell you, Marie, what I have told you already, and you too,\nAllan, that this thing may not be,\" answered Marais, hitting the table\nwith his fist. \"I have nothing to say against you, Allan; indeed, I\nhonour you, and you have done me a mighty service, but it may not be.\"\n\n\"Why not, mynheer?\" I asked.\n\n\"For three reasons, Allan, each of which is final. You are English, and\nI do not wish my daughter to marry an Englishman; that is the first.\nYou are poor, which is no discredit to you, and since I am now ruined my\ndaughter cannot marry a poor man; that is the second. You live here, and\nmy daughter and I are leaving this country, therefore you cannot marry\nher; that is the third,\" and he paused.\n\n\"Is there not a fourth,\" I asked, \"which is the real reason? Namely,\nthat you wish your daughter to marry someone else.\"\n\n\"Yes, Allan; since you force me to it, there is a fourth. I have\naffianced my daughter to her cousin, Hernando Pereira, a man of\nsubstance and full age; no lad, but one who knows his own mind and can\nsupport a wife.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" I answered calmly, although within my heart a very\nhell was raging. \"But tell me, mynheer, has Marie affianced herself--or\nperhaps she will answer with her own lips?\"\n\n\"Yes, Allan,\" replied Marie in her quiet fashion, \"I have affianced\nmyself--to you and no other man.\"\n\n\"You hear, mynheer,\" I said to Marais.\n\nThen he broke out in his usual excitable manner. He stormed, he argued,\nhe rated us both. He said that he would never allow it; that first he\nwould see his daughter in her grave. That I had abused his confidence\nand violated his hospitality; that he would shoot me if I came near his\ngirl. That she was a minor, and according to the law he could dispose of\nher in marriage. That she must accompany him whither he was going; that\ncertainly I should not do so, and much more of the same sort.\n\nWhen at last he had tired himself out and smashed his favourite pipe\nupon the table, Marie spoke, saying:\n\n\"My father, you know that I love you dearly, for since my mother's death\nwe have been everything to each other, have we not?\"\n\n\"Surely, Marie, you are my life, and more than my life.\"\n\n\"Very well, my father. That being so, I acknowledge your authority over\nme, whatever the law may say. I acknowledge that you have the right to\nforbid me to marry Allan, and if you do forbid me--while I am under age,\nat any rate--I shall not marry him because of my duty to you. But\"--here\nshe rose and looked him full in the eyes, and oh! how stately she seemed\nat that moment in her simple strength and youthful grace!--\"there is one\nthing, my father, that I do not acknowledge--your right to force me to\nmarry any other man. As a woman with power over herself, I deny that\nright; and much as it pains me, my father, to refuse you anything, I say\nthat first I will die. To Allan here I have given myself for good or for\nevil, and if I may not marry Allan, I will go to the grave unwed. If\nmy words hurt you, I pray you to pardon me, but at the same time to\nremember that they are my words, which cannot be altered.\"\n\nMarais looked at his daughter, and his daughter looked at Marais. At\nfirst I thought that he was about to curse her; but if this were so,\nsomething in her eyes seemed to change his mind, for all he said was:\n\n\"Intractable, like the rest of your race! Well, Fate may lead those who\ncannot be driven, and this matter I leave in the hands of Fate. While\nyou are under age--that is, for two years or more--you may not marry\nwithout my consent, and have just promised not to do so. Presently we\ntrek from this country into far-off lands. Who knows what may happen\nthere?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said my father in a solemn voice, speaking for the first time,\n\"who knows except God, Who governs all things, and will settle these\nmatters according to His will, Henri Marais? Listen,\" he went on after\na pause, for Marais made no answer, but sat himself down and stared\ngloomily at the table. \"You do not wish my son to marry your daughter\nfor various reasons, of which one is that you think him poor and a\nricher suitor has offered himself after a reverse of fortune has made\n_you_ poor. Another and a greater, the true reason, is his English\nblood, which you hate so much that, although by God's mercy he saved her\nlife, you do not desire that he should share her life. Is it not true?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is true, Mynheer Quatermain. You English are bullies and\ncheats,\" he answered excitedly.\n\n\"And so you would give your daughter to one who has shown himself humble\nand upright, to that good hater of the English and plotter against his\nKing, Hernando Pereira, whom you love because he alone is left of your\nancient race.\"\n\nRemembering the incident of the afternoon, this sarcasm reduced Marais\nto silence.\n\n\"Well,\" went on my father, \"although I am fond of Marie, and know her\nto be a sweet and noble-hearted girl, neither do I wish that she should\nmarry my son. I would see him wed to some English woman, and not dragged\ninto the net of the Boers and their plottings. Still, it is plain that\nthese two love each other with heart and soul, as doubtless it has\nbeen decreed that they should love. This being so, I tell you that to\nseparate them and force another marriage upon one of them is a crime\nbefore God, of which, I am sure, He will take note and pay it back to\nyou. Strange things may happen in those lands whither you go, Henri\nMarais. Will you not, then, be content to leave your child in safe\nkeeping?\"\n\n\"Never!\" shouted Marais. \"She shall accompany me to a new home, which is\nnot under the shadow of your accursed British flag.\"\n\n\"Then I have no more to say. On your head be it here and hereafter,\"\nreplied my father solemnly.\n\nNow unable to control myself any longer I broke in:\n\n\"But I have, mynheer. To separate Marie and myself is a sin, and one\nthat will break her heart. As for my poverty, I have something, more\nperhaps than you think, and in this rich country wealth can be earned\nby those who work, as I would do for her sake. The man to whom you would\ngive her showed his true nature this day, for he who can play so low\na trick to win a wager, will play worse tricks to win greater things.\nMoreover, the scheme must fail since Marie will not marry him.\"\n\n\"I say she shall,\" replied Marais; \"and that whether she does or not,\nshe shall accompany me and not stay here to be the wife of an English\nboy.\"\n\n\"Accompany you I will, father, and share your fortunes to the last. But\nmarry Hernando Pereira I will not,\" said Marie quietly.\n\n\"Perhaps, mynheer,\" I added, \"days may come when once again you will be\nglad of the help of an 'English boy.'\"\n\nThe words were spoken at random, a kind of ejaculation from the heart,\ncaused by the sting of Marais's cruelty and insults, like the cry of a\nbeast beneath a blow. Little did I know how true they would prove, but\nat times it is thus that truth is mysteriously drawn from some well of\nsecret knowledge hidden in our souls.\n\n\"When I want your help I will ask for it,\" raved Marais, who, knowing\nhimself to be in the wrong, strove to cover up that wrong with violence.\n\n\"Asked or unasked, if I live it shall be given in the future as in the\npast, Mynheer Marais. God pardon you for the woe you are bringing on\nMarie and on me.\"\n\nNow Marie began to weep a little, and, unable to bear that sight, I\ncovered my eyes with my hand. Marais, who, when he was not under the\ninfluence of his prejudices or passion, had a kind heart, was moved\nalso, but tried to hide his feelings in roughness. He swore at Marie,\nand told her to go to bed, and she obeyed, still weeping. Then my father\nrose and said:\n\n\"Henri Marais, we cannot leave here to-night because the horses are\nkraaled, and it would be difficult to find them in this darkness, so we\nmust ask your hospitality till dawn.\"\n\n\"_I_ do not ask it,\" I exclaimed. \"I go to sleep in the cart,\" and I\nlimped from the room and the house, leaving the two men together.\n\nWhat passed afterwards between them I do not quite know. I gathered\nthat my father, who, when roused, also had a temper and was mentally\nand intellectually the stronger man, told Marais his opinion of his\nwickedness and folly in language that he was not likely to forget.\nI believe he even drove him to confess that his acts seemed cruel,\nexcusing them, however, by announcing that he had sworn before God that\nhis daughter should never marry an Englishman. Also he said that he had\npromised her solemnly to Pereira, his own nephew, whom he loved, and\ncould not break his word.\n\n\"No,\" answered my father, \"because, being mad with the madness that runs\nbefore destruction, you prefer to break Marie's heart and perhaps become\nguilty of her blood.\"\n\nThen he left him.\n\n\nThe darkness was intense. Through it I groped my way to the cart, which\nstood where it had been outspanned on the veld at a little distance from\nthe house, wishing heartily, so miserable was I, that the Kaffirs might\nchoose that black night for another attack and make an end of me.\n\nWhen I reached it and lit the lantern which we always carried, I was\nastonished to find that, in a rough fashion, it had been made ready to\nsleep in. The seats had been cleared out, the hind curtain fastened, and\nso forth. Also the pole was propped up with an ox-yoke so as to make the\nvehicle level to lie in. While I was wondering vaguely who could have\ndone this, Hans climbed on to the step, carrying two karosses which he\nhad borrowed or stolen, and asked if I was comfortable.\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" I answered; \"but why were you going to sleep in the cart?\"\n\n\"Baas,\" he replied, \"I was not; I prepared it for you. How did I know\nthat you were coming? Oh, very simply. I sat on the stoep and listened\nto all the talk in the sitkammer. The window has never been mended,\nbaas, since the Quabies broke it. God in Heaven! what a talk that was.\nI never knew that white people could have so much to say about a simple\nmatter. You want to marry the Baas Marais's daughter; the baas wants her\nto marry another man who can pay more cattle. Well, among us it would\nsoon have been settled, for the father would have taken a stick and\nbeaten you out of the hut with the thick end. Then he would have beaten\nthe girl with the thin end until she promised to take the other man, and\nall would have been settled nicely. But you Whites, you talk and talk,\nand nothing is settled. You still mean to marry the daughter, and the\ndaughter still means not to marry the man of many cows. Moreover, the\nfather has really gained nothing except a sick heart and much bad luck\nto come.\"\n\n\"Why much bad luck to come, Hans?\" I asked idly, for his na\u00efve summing\nup of the case interested me in a vague way.\n\n\"Oh! Baas Allan, for two reasons. First, your reverend father, who made\nme true Christian, told him so, and a pr\u00e9dicant so good as he, is one\ndown whom the curse of God runs from Heaven like lightning runs down a\ntree. Well, the Heer Marais was sitting under that tree, and we all know\nwhat happens to him who is under a tree when the lightning strikes it.\nThat my first Christian reason. My second black-man reason, about which\nthere can be no mistake, for it has always been true since there was a\nblack man, is that the girl is yours by blood. You saved her life with\nyour blood,\" and he pointed to my leg, \"and therefore bought her for\never, for blood is more than cattle. Therefore, too, he who would divide\nher from you brings blood on her and on the other man who tries to steal\nher, blood, blood! and on himself I know not what.\" And he waved his\nyellow arms, staring up at me with his little black eyes in a way that\nwas most uncanny.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" I said. \"Why do you talk such bad words?\"\n\n\"Because they are true words, Baas Allan. Oh, you laugh at the poor\nTotty; but I had it from my father, and he from his father from\ngeneration to generation, amen, and you will see. You will see, as I\nhave seen before now, and as the Heer Marais will see, who, if the great\nGod had not made him mad--for mad he is, baas, as we know, if you Whites\ndon't--might have lived in his home till he was old, and have had a good\nson-in-law to bury him in his blanket.\"\n\nNow I seemed to have had enough of this eerie conversation. Of course it\nis easy to laugh at natives and their superstitions, but, after a long\nlife of experience, I am bound to admit that they are not always devoid\nof truth. The native has some kind of sixth sense which the civilised\nman has lost, or so it seems to me.\n\n\"Talking of blankets,\" I said in order to change the subject, \"from whom\ndid you get these karosses?\"\n\n\"From whom? Why, from the Missie, of course, baas. When I heard that you\nwere to sleep in the cart I went to her and borrowed them to cover\nyou. Also, I had forgotten, she gave me a writing for you,\" and he felt\nabout, first in his dirty shirt, then under his arm, and finally in his\nfuzzy hair, from which last hiding place he produced a little bit of\npaper folded into a pellet. I undid it and read these words, written\nwith a pencil and in French:--\n\n\n\"I shall be in the peach orchard half an hour before sunrise. Be there\nif you would bid me farewell.--M.\"\n\n\n\"Is there any answer, baas?\" asked Hans when I had thrust the note\ninto my pocket. \"If so I can take it without being found out.\" Then an\ninspiration seemed to strike him, and he added: \"Why do you not take it\nyourself? The Missie's window is easy to open, also I am sure she would\nbe pleased to see you.\"\n\n\"Be silent,\" I said. \"I am going to sleep. Wake me an hour before the\ncock-crow--and, stay--see that the horses have got out of the kraal\nso that you cannot find them too easily in case the Reverend wishes to\nstart very early. But do not let them wander far, for here we are no\nwelcome guests.\"\n\n\"Yes, baas. By the way, baas, the Heer Pereira, who tried to cheat you\nover those geese, is sleeping in an empty house not more than two miles\naway. He drinks coffee when he wakes up in the morning, and his servant,\nwho makes it, is my good friend. Now would you like me to put a little\nsomething into it? Not to kill him, for that is against the law in the\nBook, but just to make him quite mad, for the Book says nothing about\nthat. If so, I have a very good medicine, one that you white people do\nnot know, which improves the taste of the coffee, and it might save much\ntrouble. You see, if he came dancing about the place without any clothes\non, like a common Kaffir, the Heer Marais, although _he_ is really mad\nalso, might not wish for him as a son-in-law.\"\n\n\"Oh! go to the devil if you are not there already,\" I replied, and\nturned over as though to sleep.\n\n\nThere was no need for me to have instructed that faithful creature, the\nastute but immoral Hans, to call me early, as the lady did her mother in\nthe poem, for I do not think that I closed an eye that night. I spare\nmy reflections, for they can easily be imagined in the case of an\nearnest-natured lad who was about to be bereft of his first love.\n\nLong before the dawn I stood in the peach orchard, that orchard where\nwe had first met, and waited. At length Marie came stealing between\nthe tree trunks like a grey ghost, for she was wrapped in some\nlight-coloured garment. Oh! once more we were alone together. Alone in\nthe utter solitude and silence which precede the African dawn, when all\ncreatures that love the night have withdrawn to their lairs and hiding\nplaces, and those that love the day still sleep their soundest.\n\nShe saw me and stood still, then opened her arms and clasped me to her\nbreast, uttering no word. A while later she spoke almost in a whisper,\nsaying:\n\n\"Allan, I must not stay long, for I think that if my father found us\ntogether, he would shoot you in his madness.\"\n\nNow as always it was of me she thought, not of herself.\n\n\"And you, my sweet?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh!\" she answered, \"that matters nothing. Except for the sin of it I\nwish he would shoot me, for then I should have done with all this pain.\nI told you, Allan, when the Kaffirs were on us yonder, that it might be\nbetter to die; and see, my heart spoke truly.\"\n\n\"Is there no hope?\" I gasped. \"Will he really separate us and take you\naway into the wilderness?\"\n\n\"Certainly, nothing can turn him. Yet, Allan, there is this hope. In two\nyears, if I live, I shall be of full age, and can marry whom I will; and\nthis I swear, that I will marry none but you, no, not even if you were\nto die to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I bless you for those words,\" I said.\n\n\"Why?\" she asked simply. \"What others could I speak? Would you have me\ndo outrage to my own heart and go through life faithless and ashamed?\"\n\n\"And I, I swear also,\" I broke in.\n\n\"Nay, swear nothing. While I live I know that you will love me, and if\nI should be taken, it is my wish that you should marry some other good\nwoman, since it is not well or right that man should live alone. With\nus maids it is different. Listen, Allan, for the cocks are beginning to\ncrow, and soon there will be light. You must bide here with your father.\nIf possible, I will write to you from time to time, telling you where\nwe are and how we fare. But if I do not write, know that it is because I\ncannot, or because I can find no messenger, or because the letters have\nmiscarried, for we go into wild countries, amongst savages.\"\n\n\"Whither do you go?\" I asked.\n\n\"I believe up towards the great harbour called Delagoa Bay, where the\nPortuguese rule. My cousin Hernan, who accompanies us\"--and she shivered\na little in my arms--\"is half Portuguese. He tells the Boers that he\nhas relations there who have written him many fine promises, saying they\nwill give us good country to dwell in where we cannot be followed by the\nEnglish, whom he and my father hate so much.\"\n\n\"I have heard that is all fever veld, and that the country between is\nfull of fierce Kaffirs,\" I said with a groan.\n\n\"Perhaps. I do not know, and I do not care. At least, that is the notion\nin my father's head, though, of course, circumstances may change it.\nI will try to let you know, Allan, or if I do not, perhaps you will be\nable to find out for yourself. Then, then, if we both live and you still\ncare for me, who will always care for you, when I am of age, you will\njoin us and, say and do what they may, I will marry no other man. And if\nI die, as may well happen, oh! then my spirit shall watch over you and\nwait for you till you join me beneath the wings of God. Look, it grows\nlight. I must go. Farewell, my love, my first and only love, till in\nlife or death we meet again, as meet we shall.\"\n\nOnce more we clung together and kissed, muttering broken words, and then\nshe tore herself from my embrace and was gone. But oh! as I heard her\nfeet steal through the dew-laden grass, I felt as though my heart were\nbeing rent from my breast. I have suffered much in life, but I do not\nthink that ever I underwent a bitterer anguish than in this hour of my\nparting from Marie. For when all is said and done, what joy is\nthere like the joy of pure, first love, and what bitterness like the\nbitterness of its loss?\n\n\nHalf an hour later the flowering trees of Maraisfontein were behind us,\nwhile in front rolled the fire-swept veld, black as life had become for\nme.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. ALLAN'S CALL\n\n\nA fortnight later Marais, Pereira and their companions, a little band\nin all of about twenty men, thirty women and children, and say fifty\nhalf-breeds and Hottentot after-riders, trekked from their homes into\nthe wilderness. I rode to the crest of a table-topped hill and watched\nthe long line of wagons, one of them containing Marie, crawl away\nnorthward across the veld a mile or more beneath.\n\nSorely was I tempted to gallop after them and seek a last interview with\nher and her father. But my pride forbade me. Henri Marais had given\nout that if I came near his daughter he would have me beaten back with\n\"sjambocks\" or hide whips. Perhaps he had gained some inkling of our\nlast farewell in the peach orchard. I do not know. But I do know that if\nanyone had lifted a sjambock on me I should have answered with a bullet.\nThen there would have been blood between us, which is worse to cross\nthan whole rivers of wrath and jealousy. So I just watched the wagons\nuntil they vanished, and galloped home down the rock-strewn slope,\nwishing that the horse would stumble and break my neck.\n\nWhen I reached the station, however, I was glad that it had not done so,\nas I found my father sitting on the stoep reading a letter that had been\nbrought by a mounted Hottentot.\n\nIt was from Henri Marais, and ran thus:--\n\n\n\"'REVEREND HEER AND FRIEND QUATERMAIN,--I send this to bid you farewell,\nfor although you are English and we have quarrelled at times, I honour\nyou in my heart. Friend, now that we are starting, your warning words\nlie on me like lead, I know not why. But what is done cannot be undone,\nand I trust that all will come right. If not, it is because the Good\nLord wills it otherwise.'\"\n\n\nHere my father looked up and said: \"When men suffer from their own\npassion and folly, they always lay the blame on the back of Providence.\"\n\nThen he went on, spelling out the letter:\n\n\n\"'I fear your boy Allan, who is a brave lad, as I have reason to know,\nand honest, must think that I have treated him harshly and without\ngratitude. But I have only done what I must do. True, Marie, who, like\nher mother, is very strong and stubborn in mind, swears that she will\nmarry no one else; but soon Nature will make her forget all that,\nespecially as such a fine husband waits for her hand. So bid Allan\nforget all about her also, and when he is old enough choose some English\ngirl. I have sworn a great oath before my God that he shall never marry\nmy daughter with my consent.\n\n\"'Friend, I write to ask you something because I trust you more than\nthese slim agents. Half the price, a very poor one, that I have for my\nfarm is still unpaid to me by Jacobus van der Merve, who remains behind\nand buys up all our lands. It is \u00a3100 English, due this day year, and I\nenclose you power of attorney to receive and give receipt for the same.\nAlso there is due to me from your British Government \u00a3253 on account\nof slaves liberated which were worth quite \u00a31,000. This also the paper\ngives you authority to receive. As regards my claims against the said\ncursed Government because of the loss brought on me by the Quabie\nKaffirs, it will not acknowledge them, saying that the attack was caused\nby the Frenchman Leblanc, one of my household.'\"\n\n\n\"And with good reason,\" commented my father.\n\n\n\"'When you have received these monies, if ever, I pray you take some\nsafe opportunity of sending them to me, wherever I may be, which\ndoubtless you will hear in due course, although by that time I hope to\nbe rich again and not to need money. Farewell and God be with you, as\nI hope He will be with me and Marie and the rest of us trek-Boers. The\nbearer will overtake us with your answer at our first outspan.\n\n\"'HENRI MARAIS.'\"\n\n\n\"Well,\" said my father with a sigh, \"I suppose I must accept his trust,\nthough why he should choose an 'accursed Englishman' with whom he has\nquarrelled violently to collect his debts instead of one of his own\nbeloved Boers, I am sure I do not know. I will go and write to him.\nAllan, see that the messenger and his horse get something to eat.\"\n\nI nodded and went to the man, who was one of those that had defended\nMaraisfontein with me, a good fellow unless he got near liquor.\n\n\"Heer Allan,\" he said, looking round to see that we were not overheard,\n\"I have a little writing for you also,\" and he produced from his pouch a\nnote that was unaddressed.\n\nI tore it open eagerly. Within was written in French, which no Boer\nwould understand if the letter fell into his hands:\n\n\n\"Be brave and faithful, and remember, as I shall. Oh! love of my heart,\nadieu, adieu!\"\n\n\nThis message was unsigned; but what need was there of signature?\n\nI wrote an answer of a sort that may be imagined, though what the exact\nwords were I cannot remember after the lapse of nearly half a century.\nOddly enough, it is the things I said which I recall at such a distance\nof time rather than the things which I wrote, perhaps because, when once\nwritten, my mind being delivered, troubled itself with them no more. So\nin due course the Hottentot departed with my father's letter and my own,\nand that was the last direct communication which we had with Henri or\nMarie Marais for more than a year.\n\nI think that those long months were on the whole the most wretched I\nhave ever spent. The time of life which I was passing through is always\ntrying; that period of emergence from youth into full and responsible\nmanhood which in Africa generally takes place earlier than it does\nhere in England, where young men often seem to me to remain boys up\nto five-and-twenty. The circumstances which I have detailed made it\nparticularly so in my own case, for here was I, who should have been but\na cheerful lad, oppressed with the sorrows and anxieties, and fettered\nby the affections of maturity.\n\nI could not get Marie out of my mind; her image was with me by day and\nby night, especially by night, which caused me to sleep badly. I became\nmorose, supersensitive, and excitable. I developed a cough, and thought,\nas did others, that I was going into a decline. I remember that Hans\neven asked me once if I would not come and peg out the exact place where\nI should like to be buried, so that I might be sure that there would\nbe no mistake made when I could no longer speak for myself. On that\noccasion I kicked Hans, one of the few upon which I have ever touched\na native. The truth was that I had not the slightest intention of being\nburied. I wanted to live and marry Marie, not to die and be put in\na hole by Hans. Only I saw no prospect of marrying Marie, or even of\nseeing her again, and that was why I felt low-spirited.\n\nOf course, from time to time news of the trek-Boers reached us, but\nit was extremely confused. There were so many parties of them; their\nadventures were so difficult to follow, and, I may add, often so\nterrible; so few of them could write; trustworthy messengers were\nso scanty; distances were so great. At any rate, we heard nothing of\nMarais's band except a rumour that they had trekked to a district in\nwhat is now the Transvaal, which is called Rustenberg, and thence on\ntowards Delagoa Bay into an unknown veld where they had vanished. From\nMarie herself no letter came, which showed me clearly enough that she\nhad not found an opportunity of sending one.\n\nObserving my depressed condition, my father suggested as a remedy that I\nshould go to the theological college at Cape Town and prepare myself\nfor ordination. But the Church as a career did not appeal to me, perhaps\nbecause I felt that I could never be sufficiently good; perhaps because\nI knew that as a clergyman I should find no opportunity of travelling\nnorth when my call came. For I always believed that this call would\ncome.\n\nMy father, who wished that I should hear another kind of call, was vexed\nwith me over this matter. He desired earnestly that I should follow the\nprofession which he adorned, and indeed saw no other open for me any\nmore than I did myself. Of course he was right in a way, seeing that in\nthe end I found none, unless big game hunting and Kaffir trading can be\ncalled a profession. I don't know, I am sure. Still, poor business as\nit may be, I say now when I am getting towards the end of life that I\nam glad I did not follow any other. It has suited me; that was the\ninsignificant hole in the world's affairs which I was destined to fit,\nwhose only gifts were a remarkable art of straight shooting and the more\ncommon one of observation mixed with a little untrained philosophy.\n\nSo hot did our arguments become about this subject of the Church, for,\nas may be imagined, in the course of them I revealed some unorthodoxy,\nespecially as regards the matter of our methods of Christianising\nKaffirs, that I was extremely thankful when a diversion occurred which\ntook me away from home. The story of my defence of Maraisfontein had\nspread far, and that of my feats of shooting, especially in the Goose\nKloof, still farther. So the end of it was that those in authority\ncommandeered me to serve in one of the continual Kaffir frontier wars\nwhich was in progress, and instantly gave me a commission as a kind of\nlieutenant in a border corps.\n\nNow the events of that particular war have nothing to do with the\nhistory that I am telling, so I do not propose even to touch on them.\nI served in it for a year, meeting with many adventures, one or two\nsuccesses, and several failures. Once I was wounded slightly, twice\nI but just escaped with my life. Once I was reprimanded for taking a\nfoolish risk and losing some men. Twice I was commended for what were\ncalled gallant actions, such as bringing a wounded comrade out of danger\nunder a warm fire, mostly of assegais, and penetrating by night, almost\nalone, into the stronghold of a chieftain, and shooting him.\n\nAt length that war was patched up with an inconclusive peace and my\ncorps was disbanded. I returned home, no longer a lad, but a man with\nexperience of various kinds and a rather unique knowledge of Kaffirs,\ntheir languages, history, and modes of thought and action. Also I had\nassociated a good deal with British officers, and from them acquired\nmuch that I had found no opportunity of studying before, especially, I\nhope, the ideas and standards of English gentlemen.\n\nI had not been back at the Mission Station more than three weeks, quite\nlong enough for me to begin to be bored with idleness and inactivity,\nwhen that call for which I had been waiting came at last.\n\nOne day a \"smous\", that is a low kind of white man, often a Jew, who\ntravels about trading with unsophisticated Boers and Kaffirs, and\ncheating them if he can, called at the station with his cartful of\ngoods. I was about to send him away, having no liking for such gentry,\nwhen he asked me if I were named Allan Quatermain. I said \"Yes,\" whereon\nhe replied that he had a letter for me, and produced a packet wrapped up\nin sail-cloth. I asked him whence he had it, and he answered from a man\nwhom he had met at Port Elizabeth, an east coast trader, who, hearing\nthat he was coming into the Cradock district, entrusted him with the\nletter. The man told him that it was very important, and that I should\nreward the bearer well if it were delivered safely.\n\nWhile the Jew talked (I think he was a Jew) I was opening the\nsail-cloth. Within was a piece of linen which had been oiled to keep out\nwater, addressed in some red pigment to myself or my father. This, too,\nI opened, not without difficulty, for it was carefully sewn up, and\nfound within it a letter-packet, also addressed to myself or my father,\nin the handwriting of Marie.\n\nGreat Heaven! How my heart jumped at that sight! Calling to Hans to make\nthe smous comfortable and give him food, I went into my own room, and\nthere read the letter, which ran thus:\n\n\n\"MY DEAR ALLAN,--I do not know whether the other letters I have written\nto you have ever come to your hands, or indeed if this one will. Still,\nI send it on chance by a wandering Portuguese half-breed who is going\nto Delagoa Bay, about fifty miles, I believe, from the place where I now\nwrite, near the Crocodile River. My father has named it Maraisfontein,\nafter our old home. If those letters reached you, you will have learned\nof the terrible things we went through on our journey; the attacks by\nthe Kaffirs in the Zoutpansberg region, who destroyed one of our parties\naltogether, and so forth. If not, all that story must wait, for it is\ntoo long to tell now, and, indeed, I have but little paper, and not\nmuch pencil. It will be enough to say, therefore, that to the number\nof thirty-five white people, men, women and children, we trekked at the\nbeginning of the summer season, when the grass was commencing to grow,\nfrom the Lydenburg district--an awful journey over mountains and through\nflooded rivers. After many delays, some of them months long, we reached\nthis place, about eight weeks ago, for I write to you at the beginning\nof June, if we have kept correct account of the time, of which I am not\ncertain.\n\n\"It is a beautiful place to look at, a flat country of rich veld, with\nbig trees growing on it, and about two miles from the great river that\nis called the Crocodile. Here, finding good water, my father and Hernan\nPereira, who now rules him in all things, determined to settle, although\nsome of the others wished to push on nearer to Delagoa Bay. There was a\ngreat quarrel about it, but in the end my father, or rather Hernan, had\nhis will, as the oxen were worn out and many had already died from the\nbites of a poisonous fly which is called the tsetse. So we lotted out\nthe land, of which there is enough for hundreds, and began to build rude\nhouses.\n\n\"Then trouble came upon us. The Kaffirs stole most of our horses,\nalthough they have not dared to attack us, and except two belonging to\nHernan, the rest died of the sickness, the last of them but yesterday.\nThe oxen, too, have all died of the tsetse bites or other illnesses. But\nthe worst is that although this country looks so healthy, it is poisoned\nwith fever, which comes up, I think, in the mists from the river.\nAlready out of the thirty-five of us, ten are dead, two men, three\nwomen, and five children, while more are sick. As yet my father and\nI and my cousin Pereira have, by God's mercy, kept quite well; but\nalthough we are all very strong, how long this will continue I cannot\ntell. Fortunately we have plenty of ammunition and the place is thick\nwith game, so that those of the men who remain strong can kill all the\nfood we want, even shooting on foot, and we women have made a great\nquantity of biltong by salting flesh and drying it in the sun. So we\nshall not actually starve for a long while, even if the game goes away.\n\n\"But, dear Allan, unless help comes to us I think that we shall die\nevery one, for God alone knows the miseries that we suffer and the\nhorrible sights of sickness and death that are around us. At this moment\nthere lies by me a little girl who is dying of fever.\n\n\"Oh, Allan, if you can help us, do so! Because of our sick it is\nimpossible for us to get to Delagoa Bay, and if we did we have no money\nto buy anything there, for all that we had with us was lost in a wagon\nin a flooded river. It was a great sum, for it included Hernan's rich\nfortune which he brought from the Cape with him in gold. Nor can we move\nanywhere else, for we have no cattle or horses. We have sent to Delagoa\nBay, where we hear these are to be had, to try to buy them on credit;\nbut my cousin Hernan's relations, of whom he used to talk so much,\nare dead or gone away, and no one will trust us. With the neighbouring\nKaffirs, too, who have plenty of cattle, we have quarrelled since,\nunfortunately, my cousin and some of the other Boers tried to take\ncertain beasts of theirs without payment. So we are quite helpless, and\ncan only wait for death.\n\n\"Allan, my father says that he asked your father to collect some monies\nthat were owing to him. If it were possible for you or other friends to\ncome to Delagoa in a ship with that money, I think that it might serve\nto buy some oxen, enough for a few wagons. Then perhaps we might trek\nback and fall in with a party of Boers who, we believe, have crossed the\nQuathlamba Mountains into Natal. Or perhaps we might get to the Bay and\nfind a ship to take us anywhere from this horrible place. If you could\ncome, the natives would guide you to where we are.\n\n\"But it is too much to hope that you will come, or that if you do come\nyou will find us still alive.\n\n\"Allan, my dearest, I have one more thing to say, though I must say it\nshortly, for the paper is nearly finished. I do not know, supposing that\nyou are alive and well, whether you still care for me, who left you so\nlong ago--it seems years and years--but _my_ heart is where it was, and\nwhere I promised it should remain, in your keeping. Of course, Hernan\nhas pressed me to marry him, and my father has wished it. But I have\nalways said no, and now, in our wretchedness, there is no more talk of\nmarriage at present, which is the one good thing that has happened to\nme. And, Allan, before so very long I shall be of age, if I live. Still\nI dare say you no longer think of marriage with me, who, perhaps, are\nalready married to someone else, especially as now I and all of us are\nno better than wandering beggars. Yet I have thought it right to tell\nyou these things, which you may like to know.\n\n\"Oh, why did God ever put it into my father's heart to leave the Cape\nColony just because he hated the British Government and Hernan Pereira\nand others persuaded him? I know not, but, poor man, he is sorry enough\nnow. It is pitiful to see him; at times I think that he is going mad.\n\n\"The paper is done, and the messenger is going; also the sick child\nis dying and I must attend to her. Will this letter ever come to your\nhands, I wonder? I am sending with it the little money I have to pay for\nits delivery--about four pounds English. If not, there is an end. If it\ndoes, and you cannot come or send others, at least pray for us. I dream\nof you by night and think of you by day, for how much I love you I\ncannot tell.\n\n\"In life or death I am\n\n\"Your MARIE.\"\n\n\nSuch was this awful letter. I still have it; it lies before me, those\nragged sheets of paper covered with faint pencil-writing that is blotted\nhere and there with tear marks, some of them the tears of Marie who\nwrote, some of them the tears of me who read. I wonder if there exists a\nmore piteous memorial of the terrible sufferings of the trek-Boers, and\nespecially of such of them as forced their way into the poisonous\nveld around Delagoa, as did this Marais expedition and those under\nthe command of Triechard. Better, like many of their people, to have\nperished at once by the spears of Umzilikazi and other savages than to\nendure these lingering tortures of fever and starvation.\n\nAs I finished reading this letter my father, who had been out visiting\nsome of his Mission Kaffirs, entered the house, and I went into the\nsitting-room to meet him.\n\n\"Why, Allan, what is the matter with you?\" he asked, noting my\ntear-stained face.\n\nI gave him the letter, for I could not speak, and with difficulty he\ndeciphered it.\n\n\"Merciful God, what dreadful news!\" he said when he had finished. \"Those\npoor people! those poor, misguided people! What can be done for them?\"\n\n\"I know one thing that can be done, father, or at any rate can be\nattempted. I can try to reach them.\"\n\n\"Are you mad?\" he asked. \"How is it possible for you, one man, to get to\nDelagoa Bay, buy cattle, and rescue these folk, who probably are now all\ndead?\"\n\n\"The first two things are possible enough, father. Some ship will take\nme to the Bay. You have Marais's money, and I have that five hundred\npounds which my old aunt in England left me last year. Thank Heaven!\nowing to my absence on commando, it still lies untouched in the bank at\nPort Elizabeth. That is about eight hundred pounds in all, which would\nbuy a great many cattle and other things. As for the third, it is not in\nour hands, is it? It may be that they cannot be rescued, it may be that\nthey are dead. I can only go to see.\"\n\n\"But, Allan, Allan, you are my only son, and if you go it is probable\nthat I shall never see you more.\"\n\n\"I have been through more dangers lately, father, and am still alive\nand well. Moreover, if Marie is dead\"--I paused, then went on\npassionately--\"Do not try to stop me, for I tell you, father, I will not\nbe stopped. Think of the words in that letter and what a shameless hound\nI should be if I sat here quiet while Marie is dying yonder. Would you\nhave done so if Marie had been my mother?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered the old gentleman, \"I should not. Go, and God be with\nyou, Allan, and me also, for I never expect to see you again.\" And he\nturned his head aside for a while.\n\nThen we went into matters. The smous was summoned and asked about the\nship which brought the letter from Delagoa. It seemed that she was an\nEnglish-owned brig known as the Seven Stars, and that her captain, one\nRichardson, proposed to sail back to the Bay on the morrow, that was the\nthird of July, or in other words, within twenty-four hours.\n\nTwenty-four hours! And Port Elizabeth was one hundred and eighteen miles\naway, and the Seven Stars might leave earlier if she had completed her\ncargo and wind and weather served. Moreover, if she did leave, it might\nbe weeks or months before any other ship sailed for Delagoa Bay, for in\nthose days, of course, there were no mail boats.\n\nI looked at my watch. It was four o'clock in the afternoon, and from a\ncalendar we had, which gave the tides at Port Elizabeth and other South\nAfrican harbours, it did not seem probable that the Seven Stars would\nsail, if she kept to her date, before about eight on the morrow. One\nhundred and twenty miles to be covered in, say, fourteen hours over\nrough country with some hills! Well, on the other hand, the roads were\nfairly good and dry, with no flooded rivers to cross, although\nthere might be one to swim, and there was a full moon. It could be\ndone--barely, and now I was glad indeed that Hernan Pereira had not won\nmy swift mare in that shooting match.\n\nI called to Hans, who was loafing about outside, and said quietly:\n\n\"I ride to Port Elizabeth, and must be there by eight o'clock to-morrow\nmorning.\"\n\n\"Allemachte!\" exclaimed Hans, who had been that road several times.\n\n\"You will go with me, and from Port Elizabeth on to Delagoa Bay. Saddle\nthe mare and the roan horse, and put a headstall on the chestnut to lead\nwith you as a spare. Give them all a feed, but no water. We start in\nhalf an hour.\" Then I added certain directions as to the guns we would\ntake, saddle-bags, clothes, blankets and other details, and bade him\nstart about the business.\n\nHans never hesitated. He had been with me through my recent campaign,\nand was accustomed to sudden orders. Moreover, I think that if I had\ntold him I was riding to the moon, beyond his customary exclamation\nof \"Allemachte!\" he would have made no objection to accompanying me\nthither.\n\nThe next half-hour was a busy time for me. Henri Marais's money had to\nbe got out of the strong box and arranged in a belt of buck's hide that\nI had strapped about me. A letter had to be written by my father to the\nmanager of the Port Elizabeth bank, identifying me as the owner of the\nsum lodged there in my name. A meal must be eaten and some food prepared\nfor us to carry. The horses' shoes had to be seen to, and a few clothes\npacked in the saddle-bags. Also there were other things which I have\nforgotten. Yet within five-and-thirty minutes the long, lean mare stood\nbefore the door. Behind her, with a tall crane's feather in his hat,\nwas Hans, mounted on the roan stallion, and leading the chestnut, a\nfour-year-old which I had bought as a foal on the mare as part of\nthe bargain. Having been corn fed from a colt it was a very sound and\nwell-grown horse, though not the equal of its mother in speed.\n\nIn the passage my poor old father, who was quite bewildered by the\nrapidity and urgent nature of this business, embraced me.\n\n\"God bless you, my dear boy,\" he said. \"I have had little time to think,\nbut I pray that this may be all for the best, and that we may meet again\nin the world. But if not, remember what I have taught you, and if I\nsurvive you, for my part I shall remember that you died trying to\ndo your duty. Oh, what trouble has the blind madness of Henri Marais\nbrought upon us all! Well, I warned him that it would be so. Good-bye,\nmy dear boy, good-bye: my prayers will follow you, and for the\nrest--Well, I am old, and what does it matter if my grey hairs come with\nsorrow to the grave?\"\n\nI kissed him back, and with an aching heart sprang to the saddle. In\nfive more minutes the station was out of sight.\n\n\nThirteen and a half hours later I pulled rein upon the quay of Port\nElizabeth just, only just, in time to catch Captain Richardson as he was\nentering his boat to row out to the Seven Stars, on which the canvas\nwas already being hoisted. As well as I could in my exhausted state, I\nexplained matters and persuaded him to wait till the next tide. Then,\nthanking God for the mare's speed--the roan had been left foundered\nthirty miles away, and Hans was following on the chestnut, but not yet\nup--I dragged the poor beast to an inn at hand. There she lay down and\ndied. Well, she had done her work, and there was no other horse in the\ncountry that could have caught that boat.\n\nAn hour or so later Hans came in flogging the chestnut, and here I may\nadd that both it and the roan recovered. Indeed I rode them for many\nyears, until they were quite old. When I had eaten, or tried to eat\nsomething and rested awhile, I went to the bank, succeeded in explaining\nthe state of the case to the manager, and after some difficulty, for\ngold was not very plentiful in Port Elizabeth, procured three hundred\npounds in sovereigns. For the other two he gave me a bill upon some\nagent in Delagoa Bay, together with a letter of recommendation to him\nand the Portuguese governor, who, it appeared, was in debt to their\nestablishment. By an afterthought, however, although I kept the letters,\nI returned him the bill and spent the \u00a3200 in purchasing a great variety\nof goods which I will not enumerate, that I knew would be useful for\ntrading purposes among the east coast Kaffirs. Indeed, I practically\ncleared out the Port Elizabeth stores, and barely had time, with the\nhelp of Hans and the storekeepers, to pack and ship the goods before the\nSeven Stars put out to sea.\n\n\nWithin twenty-four hours from the time I had left the Mission Station,\nHans and I saw behind us Port Elizabeth fading into the distance, and in\nfront a waste of stormy waters.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. THE CAMP OF DEATH\n\n\nEverything went well upon that voyage, except with me personally. Not\nhaving been on the ocean since I was a child, I, who am naturally no\ngood sailor, was extremely ill as day by day we ploughed through seas\nthat grew ever more rough. Also, strong as I was, that fearful ride\nhad overdone me. Added to these physical discomforts was my agonising\nanxiety of mind, which I leave anyone with imagination to picture for\nhimself. Really there were times when I wished that the Seven Stars\nwould plunge headlong to the bottom of the deep and put an end to me and\nmy miseries.\n\nThese, however, so far as the bodily side of them was concerned, were, I\nthink, surpassed by those of my henchman Hans, who, as a matter of\nfact, had never before set foot in any kind of boat. Perhaps this was\nfortunate, since had he known the horrors of the ocean, much as he loved\nme, he would, I am sure, by one means or another, have left me to voyage\nin the Seven Stars alone. There he lay upon the floor of my little\ncabin, rolling to and fro with the violent motion of the brig, overcome\nwith terror. He was convinced that we were going to be drowned, and in\nthe intervals of furious sea-sickness uttered piteous lamentations in\nDutch, English, and various native tongues, mingled with curses and\nprayers of the most primitive and realistic order.\n\nAfter the first twenty-four hours or so he informed me with many moans\nthat the last bit of his inside had just come out of him, and that he\nwas now quite hollow \"like a gourd.\" Also he declared that all these\nevils had fallen upon him because he had been fool enough to forsake the\nreligion of his people (what was that, I wonder), and allow himself to\nbe \"washed white,\" that is, be baptised, by my father.\n\nI answered that as he had become white instead of staying yellow, I\nadvised him to remain so, since it was evident that the Hottentot gods\nwould have nothing more to do with one who had deserted them. Thereon he\nmade a dreadful face, which even in the midst of my own woes caused me\nto laugh at him, uttered a prolonged groan, and became so silent that\nI thought he must be dead. However, the sailor who brought me my\nfood--such food!--assured me that this was not so, and lashed him tight\nto the legs of the bunk by his arm and ankle so as to prevent him from\nbeing rolled to bits.\n\nNext morning Hans was dosed with brandy, which, in his empty condition,\nmade him extremely drunk, and from that time forward began to take a\nmore cheerful view of things. Especially was this so when the hours\nfor the \"brandy medicine\" came round. Hans, like most other Hottentots,\nloved spirits, and would put up with much to get them, even with my\nfather's fiery indignation.\n\nI think it was on the fourth day that at length we pitched and rolled\nourselves over the shallow bar of Port Natal and found ourselves at\npeace for a while under shelter of the Point in the beautiful bay upon\nthe shores of which the town of Durban now stands. Then it was but a\nmiserable place, consisting of a few shanties which were afterwards\nburnt by the Zulus, and a number of Kaffir huts. For such white men as\ndwelt there had for the most part native followings, and, I may add,\nnative wives.\n\nWe spent two days at this settlement of Durban, where Captain Richardson\nhad some cargo to land for the English settlers, one or two of whom had\nstarted a trade with the natives and with parties of the emigrant Boers\nwho were beginning to enter the territory by the overland route. Those\ndays I passed on shore, though I would not allow Hans to accompany\nme lest he should desert, employing my time in picking up all the\ninformation I could about the state of affairs, especially with\nreference to the Zulus, a people with whom I was destined ere long to\nmake an intimate acquaintance. Needless to say, I inquired both from\nnatives and from white men whether anything was known of the fate of\nMarais's party, but no one seemed even to have heard of them. One thing\nI did learn, however, that my old friend, Pieter Retief, with a large\nfollowing, had crossed the Quathlamba Mountains, which we now know as\nthe Drakensberg, and entered the territory of Natal. Here they proposed\nto settle if they could get the leave of the Zulu king, Dingaan, a\nsavage potentate of whom and of whose armies everyone seemed to live in\nterror.\n\nOn the third morning, to my great relief, for I was terrified lest we\nshould be delayed, the Seven Stars sailed with a favouring wind. Three\ndays later we entered the harbour of Delagoa, a sheet of water many\nmiles long and broad. Notwithstanding its shallow entrance, it is the\nbest natural port in Southeastern Africa, but now, alas! lost to the\nEnglish.\n\nSix hours later we anchored opposite a sandbank on which stood a\ndilapidated fort and a dirty settlement known as Lorenzo Marquez, where\nthe Portuguese kept a few soldiers, most of them coloured. I pass over\nmy troubles with the Customs, if such they could be called. Suffice it\nto say that ultimately I succeeded in landing my goods, on which the\nduty chargeable was apparently enormous. This I did by distributing\ntwenty-five English sovereigns among various officials, beginning with\nthe acting-governor and ending with a drunken black sweep who sat in a\nkind of sentry box on the quay.\n\nEarly next morning the Seven Stars sailed again, because of some quarrel\nwith the officials, who threatened to seize her--I forget why. Her\ndestination was the East African ports and, I think, Madagascar, where\na profitable trade was to be done in carrying cattle and slaves. Captain\nRichardson said he might be back at Lorenzo Marquez in two or\nthree months' time, or he might not. As a matter of fact the latter\nsupposition proved correct, for the Seven Stars was lost on a sandbank\nsomewhere up the coast, her crew only escaping to Mombasa after enduring\ngreat hardships.\n\nWell, she had served my turn, for I heard afterwards that no other ship\nput into the Bay for a whole year from the date she left it. So if I had\nnot caught her at Port Elizabeth I could not have come at all, except,\nof course, overland. This at best must have taken many months, and was\nmoreover a journey that no man could enter on alone.\n\nNow I get back to my story again.\n\nThere was no inn at Lorenzo Marquez. Through the kindness of one of his\nnative or half-breed wives, who could talk a little Dutch, I managed,\nhowever, to get a lodging in a tumble-down house belonging to a\ndissolute person who called himself Don Jos\u00e9 Ximenes, but who was really\nhimself a half-breed. Here good fortune befriended me. Don Jos\u00e9, when\nsober, was a trader with the natives, and a year before had acquired\nfrom them two good buck wagons. Probably they were stolen from some\nwandering Boers or found derelict after their murder or death by fever.\nThese wagons he was only too glad to sell for a song. I think I gave him\ntwenty pounds English for the two, and thirty more for twelve oxen that\nhe had bought at the same time as the wagons. They were fine beasts of\nthe Afrikander breed, that after a long rest had grown quite fat and\nstrong.\n\nOf course twelve oxen were not enough to draw two wagons, or even one.\nTherefore, hearing that there were natives on the mainland who possessed\nplenty of cattle, I at once gave out that I was ready to buy, and pay\nwell in blankets, cloth, beads and so forth. The result was that within\ntwo days I had forty or fifty to choose from, small animals of the Zulu\ncharacter and, I should add, unbroken. Still they were sturdy and used\nto that veld and its diseases. Here it was that my twelve trained beasts\ncame in. By putting six of them to each wagon, two as fore- and two as\nafter-oxen, and two in the middle, Hans and I were able to get the other\nten necessary to make up a team of sixteen under some sort of control.\n\nHeavens! how we worked during the week or so which went by before it\nwas possible for me to leave Lorenzo Marquez. What with mending up and\nloading the wagons, buying and breaking in the wild oxen, purchasing\nprovisions, hiring native servants--of whom I was lucky enough to secure\neight who belonged to one of the Zulu tribes and desired to get back to\ntheir own country, whence they had wandered with some Boers, I do not\nthink that we slept more than two or three hours out of the twenty-four.\n\nBut, it may be asked, what was my aim, whither went I, what inquiries\nhad I made? To answer the last question first, I had made every possible\ninquiry, but with little or no result. Marie's letter had said that they\nwere encamped on the bank of the Crocodile River, about fifty miles from\nDelagoa Bay. I asked everyone I met among the Portuguese--who, after\nall, were not many--if they had heard of such an encampment of emigrant\nBoers. But these Portuguese appeared to have heard nothing, except my\nhost, Don Jos\u00e9, who had a vague recollection of something--he could not\nremember what.\n\nThe fact was at this time the few people who lived at Lorenzo Marquez\nwere too sodden with liquor and other vices to take any interest in\noutside news that did not immediately concern them. Moreover, the\nnatives whom they flogged and oppressed if they were their servants, or\nfought with if they were not, told them little, and almost nothing\nthat was true, for between the two races there was an hereditary hate\nstretching back for generations. So from the Portuguese I gained no\ninformation.\n\nThen I turned to the Kaffirs, especially to those from whom I had bought\nthe cattle. _They_ had heard that some Boers reached the banks of the\nCrocodile moons ago--how many they could not tell. But that country,\nthey said, was under the rule of a chief who was hostile to them, and\nkilled any of their people who ventured thither. Therefore they knew\nnothing for certain. Still, one of them stated that a woman whom he had\nbought as a slave, and who had passed through the district in question\na few weeks before, told him that someone had told her that these Boers\nwere all dead of sickness. She added that she had seen their wagon caps\nfrom a distance, so, if they were dead, \"their wagons were still alive.\"\n\nI asked to see this woman, but the native refused to produce her. After\na great deal of talk, however, he offered to sell her to me, saying that\nhe was tired of her. So I bargained with the man and finally agreed for\nher purchase for three pounds of copper wire and eight yards of blue\ncloth. Next morning she was produced, an extremely ugly person with a\nlarge, flat nose, who came from somewhere in the interior of Africa,\nhaving, I gathered, been taken captive by Arabs and sold from hand to\nhand. Her name, as near as I can pronounce it, was Jeel.\n\nI had great difficulty in establishing communication with her, but\nultimately found that one of my newly hired Kaffirs could understand\nsomething of her language. Even then it was hard to make her talk, for\nshe had never seen a white man, and thought I had bought her for some\ndreadful purpose or other. However, when she found that she was kindly\ntreated, she opened her lips and told me the same story that her late\nmaster had repeated, neither more nor less. Finally I asked her whether\nshe could guide me to the place where she had seen the \"live wagons.\"\n\nShe answered: \"Oh, yes,\" as she had travelled many roads and never\nforgot any of them.\n\nThis, of course, was all I wanted from the woman, who, I may add,\nultimately gave me a good deal of trouble. The poor creature seemed\nnever to have experienced kindness, and her gratitude for the little\nI showed her was so intense that it became a nuisance. She followed me\nabout everywhere, trying to do me service in her savage way, and even\nattempted to seize my food and chew it before I put it into my own\nmouth--to save me the trouble, I suppose. Ultimately I married her,\nsomewhat against her will, I fear, to one of the hired Kaffirs, who made\nher a very good husband, although when he was dismissed from my service\nshe wanted to leave him and follow me.\n\nAt length, under the guidance of this woman, Jeel, we made a start.\nThere were but fifty miles to go, a distance that on a fair road any\ngood horse would cover in eight hours, or less. But we had no horses,\nand there was no road--nothing but swamps and bush and rocky hills. With\nour untrained cattle it took us three days to travel the first twelve\nmiles, though after that things went somewhat better.\n\nIt may be asked, why did I not send on? But whom could I send when no\none knew the way, except the woman, Jeel, whom I feared to part with\nlest I should see her no more? Moreover, what was the use of sending,\nsince the messengers could take no help? If everyone at the camp was\ndead, as rumour told us--well, they were dead. And if they lived, the\nhope was that they might live a little longer. Meanwhile, I dared not\npart with my guide, nor dared I leave the relief wagons to go on with\nher alone. If I did so, I knew that I should never see them again, since\nonly the prestige of their being owned by a white man who was not a\nPortuguese prevented the natives from looting them.\n\nIt was a truly awful journey. My first idea had been to follow the banks\nof the Crocodile River, which is what I should have attempted had I not\nchanced on the woman, Jeel. Lucky was it that I did not do so, since I\nfound afterwards that this river wound about a great deal and was joined\nby impassable tributaries. Also it was bordered by forests. Jeel's\ntrack, on the contrary, followed an old slave road that, bad as it was,\navoided the swampy places of the surrounding country, and those native\ntribes which the experience of generations of the traders in this\niniquitous traffic showed to be most dangerous.\n\n\nNine days of fearful struggle had gone by. We had camped one night below\nthe crest of a long slope strewn with great rocks, many of which we were\nobliged to roll out of the path by main force in order to make a way for\nthe wagons. The oxen had to lie in their yokes all night, since we\ndared not let them loose fearing lest they should stray; also lions were\nroaring in the distance, although, game being plentiful, these did not\ncome near to us. As soon as there was any light we let out the teams\nto fill themselves on the tussocky grass that grew about, and meanwhile\ncooked and ate some food.\n\nPresently the sun rose, and I saw that beneath us was a great stretch of\nplain covered with mist, and to the north, on our right, several denser\nbillows of mist that marked the course of the Crocodile River.\n\nBy degrees this mist lifted, tall tops of trees appearing above it, till\nat length it thinned into vapour that vanished away as the sun rose.\nAs I watched it idly, the woman, Jeel, crept up to me in her furtive\nfashion, touched me on the shoulder and pointed to a distant group of\ntrees.\n\nLooking closely at these trees, I saw between them what at first I\ntook for some white rocks. Further examination, as the mist cleared,\nsuggested to my mind, however, that they might be wagon tilts. Just then\nthe Zulu who understood Jeel's talk came up. I asked him as well as I\ncould, for at that time my knowledge of his tongue was very imperfect,\nwhat she wished to say. He questioned her, and answered that she desired\nto tell me that those were the moving houses of the Amaboona (the Boer\npeople), just where she had seen them nearly two moons ago.\n\nAt this tidings my heart seemed to stand still, so that for more than\na minute I could not speak. There were the wagons at last, but--oh! who\nand what should I find in them? I called Hans and bade him inspan as\nquickly as possible, explaining to him that yonder was Marais's camp.\n\n\"Why not let the oxen fill themselves first, baas?\" he answered. \"There\nis no hurry, for though the wagons are there, no doubt all the people\nare dead long ago.\"\n\n\"Do what I bid you, you ill-omened beast,\" I said, \"instead of croaking\nof death like a crow. And listen: I am going to walk forward to that\ncamp; you must follow with the wagons as fast as they can travel.\"\n\n\"No, baas, it is not safe that you should go alone. Kaffirs or wild\nbeasts might take you.\"\n\n\"Safe or not, I am going; but if you think it wise, tell two of those\nZulus to come with me.\"\n\nA few minutes later I was on the road, followed by the two Kaffirs armed\nwith spears. In my youth I was a good runner, being strong of leg and\nlight in body, but I do not think that I ever covered seven miles, for\nthat was about the distance to the camp, in quicker time than I did that\nmorning. Indeed, I left those active Kaffirs so far behind that when I\napproached the trees they were not in sight. Here I dropped to a walk,\nas I said to myself--to get my breath. Really it was because I felt so\nterrified at what I might find that I delayed the discovery just for one\nminute more. While I approached, hope, however faint, still remained;\nwhen I arrived, hope might be replaced by everlasting despair.\n\nNow I could see that there were some shanties built behind the wagons,\ndoubtless those \"rude houses\" of which Marie had written. But I could\nnot see anyone moving about them, or any cattle or any smoke, or other\nsign of life. Nor could I hear a single sound.\n\nDoubtless, thought I to myself, Hans is right. They are all long dead.\n\nMy agony of suspense was replaced by an icy calm. At length I knew the\nworst. It was finished--I had striven in vain. I walked through the\noutlying trees and between two of the wagons. One of these I noticed,\nas we do notice things at such times, was the same in which Marais had\ntrekked with his daughter, his favourite wagon that once I had helped to\nfit with a new dissel-boom.\n\nBefore me were the rough houses built of the branches of trees, daubed\nover with mud, or rather the backs of them, for they faced west. I stood\nstill for a moment, and as I stood thought that I heard a faint sound as\nof someone reciting slowly. I crept along the end of the outermost house\nand, rubbing the cold sweat from my eyes, peeped round the corner, for\nit occurred to me that savages might be in possession. Then I saw what\ncaused the sound. A tattered, blackened, bearded man stood at the head\nof a long and shallow hole saying a prayer.\n\nIt was Henri Marais, although at the time I did not recognise him, so\nchanged was he. A number of little mounds to the right and left of him\ntold me, however, that the hole was a grave. As I watched two more men\nappeared, dragging between them the body of a woman, which evidently\nthey had not strength to carry, as its legs trailed upon the ground.\nFrom the shape of the corpse it seemed to be that of a tall young woman,\nbut the features I could not see, because it was being dragged face\ndownwards. Also the long hair hanging from the head hid them. It was\ndark hair, like Marie's. They reached the grave, and tumbled their sad\nburden into it; but I--I could not stir!\n\nAt length my limbs obeyed my will. I went forward to the men and said in\na hollow voice in Dutch:\n\n\"Whom do you bury?\"\n\n\"Johanna Meyer,\" answered someone mechanically, for they did not seem\nto have taken the trouble to look at me. As I listened to those words my\nheart, which had stood still waiting for the answer, beat again with a\nsudden bound that I could hear in the silence.\n\nI looked up. There, advancing from the doorway of one of the houses,\nvery slowly, as though overpowered by weakness, and leading by the hand\na mere skeleton of a child, who was chewing some leaves, I saw--I saw\n_Marie Marais!_ She was wasted to nothing, but I could not mistake her\neyes, those great soft eyes that had grown so unnaturally large in the\nwhite, thin face.\n\nShe too saw me and stared for one moment. Then, loosing the child,\nshe cast up her hands, through which the sunlight shone as through\nparchment, and slowly sank to the ground.\n\n\"She has gone, too,\" said one of the men in an indifferent voice. \"I\nthought she would not last another day.\"\n\nNow for the first time the man at the head of the grave turned. Lifting\nhis hand, he pointed to me, whereon the other two men turned also.\n\n\"God above us!\" he said in a choked voice, \"at last I am quite mad.\nLook! there stands the spook of young Allan, the son of the English\npr\u00e9dicant who lived near Cradock.\"\n\nAs soon as I heard the voice I knew the speaker.\n\n\"Oh, Mynheer Marais!\" I cried, \"I am no ghost, I am Allan himself come\nto save you.\"\n\nMarais made no answer; he seemed bewildered. But one of the men cried\nout crazily:\n\n\"How can you save us, youngster, unless you are ready to be eaten? Don't\nyou see, we starve, we starve!\"\n\n\"I have wagons and food,\" I answered.\n\n\"Allemachte! Henri,\" exclaimed the man, with a wild laugh, \"do you hear\nwhat your English spook says? He says that he has wagons and _food,\nfood, food!_\"\n\nThen Marais burst into tears and flung himself upon my breast, nearly\nknocking me down. I wrenched myself free of him and ran to Marie, who\nwas lying face upwards on the ground. She seemed to hear my step, for\nher eyes opened and she struggled to a sitting posture.\n\n\"Is it really you, Allan, or do I dream?\" she murmured.\n\n\"It is I, it is I,\" I answered, lifting her to her feet, for she seemed\nto weigh no more than a child. Her head fell upon my shoulder, and she\ntoo began to weep.\n\nStill holding her, I turned to the men and said:\n\n\"Why do you starve when there is game all about?\" and I pointed to two\nfat elands strolling among the trees not more than a hundred and fifty\nyards away.\n\n\"Can we kill game with stones?\" asked one of them, \"we whose powder was\nall burnt a month ago. Those buck,\" he added, with a wild laugh, \"come\nhere to mock us every morning; but they will not walk into our pitfalls.\nThey know them too well, and we have no strength to dig others.\"\n\nNow when I left my wagons I had brought with me that same Purdey rifle\nwith which I had shot the geese in the match against Pereira, choosing\nit because it was so light to carry. I held up my hand for silence,\nset Marie gently on the ground, and began to steal towards the elands.\nTaking what shelter I could, I got within a hundred yards of them, when\nsuddenly they took alarm, being frightened, in fact, by my two Zulu\nservants, who were now arriving.\n\nOff they galloped, the big bull leading, and vanished behind some trees.\nI saw their line, and that they would appear again between two clumps of\nbush about two hundred and fifty yards away. Hastily I raised the full\nsight on the rifle, which was marked for two hundred yards, lifted it,\nand waited, praying to God as I did so that my skill might not fail me.\n\nThe bull appeared, its head held forward, its long horns lying flat upon\nthe back. The shot was very long, and the beast very large to bring down\nwith so small a bullet. I aimed right forward--clear of it, indeed--high\ntoo, in a line with its backbone, and pressed the trigger.\n\nThe rifle exploded, the bullet clapped, and the buck sprang forward\nfaster than ever. I had failed! But what was this? Suddenly the great\nbull swung round and began to gallop towards us. When it was not more\nthan fifty yards away, it fell in a heap, rolled twice over like a shot\nrabbit, and lay still. That bullet was in its heart.\n\nThe two Kaffirs appeared breathless and streaming with perspiration.\n\n\"Cut meat from the eland's flank; don't stop to skin it,\" I said in my\nbroken Zulu, helping the words out with signs.\n\nThey understood, and a minute later were at work with their assegais.\nThen I looked about me. Near by lay a store of dead branches placed\nthere for fuel.\n\n\"Have you fire?\" I asked of the skeleton Boers, for they were nothing\nmore.\n\n\"Nein, nein,\" they answered; \"our fire is dead.\"\n\nI produced the tinder-box which I carried with me, and struck the flint.\nTen minutes later we had a cheerful blaze, and within three-quarters of\nan hour good soup, for iron pots were not wanting--only food to put into\nthem. I think that for the rest of that day those poor creatures did\nlittle else but eat, sleeping between their meals. Oh! the joy I had in\nfeeding them, especially after the wagons arrived, bringing with them\nsalt--how they longed for that salt!--sugar and coffee.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. THE PROMISE\n\n\nOf the original thirty-five souls, not reckoning natives, who had\naccompanied Henri Marais upon his ill-fated expedition, there now\nremained but nine alive at the new Maraisfontein. These were\nhimself, his daughter, four Prinsloos--a family of extraordinary\nconstitution--and three Meyers, being the husband of the poor woman I\nhad seen committed to the grave and two of her six children. The rest,\nHernan Pereira excepted, had died of fever and actual starvation, for\nwhen the fever lessened with the change of the seasons, the starvation\nset in. It appeared that, with the exception of a very little, they had\nstored their powder in a kind of outbuilding which they constructed,\nplacing it at a distance for safety's sake. When most of the surviving\nmen were away, however, a grass fire set light to this outbuilding and\nall the powder blew up.\n\nAfter this, for a while they supplied the camp with food by the help of\nsuch ammunition as remained to them. When that failed they dug pits in\nwhich to catch game. In time the buck came to know of these pits, so\nthat they snared no more.\n\nThen, as the \"biltong\" or sun-dried meat they had made was all consumed,\nthey were driven to every desperate expedient that is known to the\nstarving, such as the digging up of bulbs, the boiling of grass, twigs\nand leaves, the catching of lizards, and so forth. I believe that they\nactually ate caterpillars and earthworms. But after their last fire went\nout through the neglect of the wretched Kaffir who was left to watch it,\nand having no tinder, they failed to relight it by friction, of course\neven this food failed them. When I arrived they had practically been\nthree days without anything to eat except green leaves and grass, such\nas I saw the child chewing. In another seventy hours doubtless every one\nof them would have been dead.\n\nWell, they recovered rapidly enough, for those who had survived its\nravages were evidently now impervious to fever. Who can tell the joy\nthat I experienced as I watched Marie returning from the very brink of\nthe grave to a state of full and lovely womanhood? After all, we were\nnot so far away from the primitive conditions of humanity, when the\nfirst duty of man was to feed his women and his children, and I think\nthat something of that instinct remains with us. At least, I know I\nnever experienced a greater pleasure than I did, when the woman I loved,\nthe poor, starving woman, ate and ate of the food which _I_ was able to\ngive her--she who for weeks had existed upon locusts and herbs.\n\nFor the first few days we did not talk much except of the immediate\nnecessities of the hour, which occupied all our thoughts. Afterwards,\nwhen Marais and his daughter were strong enough to bear it, we had some\nconversation. He began by asking how I came to find them.\n\nI replied, through Marie's letter, which, it appeared, he knew nothing\nof, for he had forbidden her to write to me.\n\n\"It seems fortunate that you were disobeyed, mynheer,\" I said, to which\nhe answered nothing.\n\nThen I told the tale of the arrival of that letter at the Mission\nStation in the Cape Colony by the hand of a wandering smous, and of\nmy desperate ride upon the swift mare to Port Elizabeth, where I just\nsucceeded in catching the brig Seven Stars before she sailed. Also I\ntold them of the lucky chances that enabled me to buy the wagons and\nfind a guide to their camp, reaching it but a few hours before it was\ntoo late.\n\n\"It was a great deed,\" said Henri Marais, taking the pipe from his\nmouth, for I had brought tobacco among my stores. \"But tell me, Allan,\nwhy did you do it for the sake of one who has not treated you kindly?\"\n\n\"I did it,\" I answered, \"for the sake of one who has always treated me\nkindly,\" and I nodded towards Marie, who was engaged in washing up the\ncooking pots at a distance.\n\n\"I suppose so, Allan; but you know she is affianced to another.\"\n\n\"I know that she is affianced to me, and to no other,\" I answered\nwarmly, adding, \"And pray where is this other? If he lives I do not see\nhim here.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Marais in a curious voice. \"The truth is, Allan, that\nHernan Pereira left us about a fortnight before you came. One horse\nremained, which was his, and with two Hottentots, who were also his\nservants, he rode back upon the track by which we came, to try to find\nhelp. Since then we have heard nothing of him.\"\n\n\"Indeed; and how did he propose to get food on the way?\"\n\n\"He had a rifle, or rather they all three had rifles, and about a\nhundred charges between them, which escaped the fire.\"\n\n\"With a hundred charges of powder carefully used your camp would have\nbeen fed for a month, or perhaps two months,\" I remarked. \"Yet he went\naway with all of them--to find help?\"\n\n\"That is so, Allan. We begged him to stay, but he would not; and, after\nall, the charges were his own property. No doubt he thought he acted for\nthe best, especially as Marie would have none of him,\" Marais added with\nemphasis.\n\n\"Well,\" I replied, \"it seems that it is I who have brought you the help,\nand not Pereira. Also, by the way, mynheer, I have brought you the money\nmy father collected on your account, and some \u00a3500 of my own, or what is\nleft of it, in goods and gold. Moreover, Marie does not refuse me. Say,\ntherefore, to which of us does she belong?\"\n\n\"It would seem that it should be to you,\" he answered slowly, \"since you\nhave shown yourself so faithful, and were it not for you she would now\nbe lying yonder,\" and he pointed to the little heaps that covered the\nbones of most of the expedition. \"Yes, yes, it would seem that it should\nbe to you, who twice have saved her life and once have saved mine also.\"\n\nNow I suppose that he saw on my face the joy which I could not conceal,\nfor he added hastily: \"Yet, Allan, years ago I swore on the Book before\nGod that never with my will should my daughter marry an Englishman, even\nif he were a good Englishman. Also, just before we left the Colony, I\nswore again, in her presence and that of Hernan Pereira, that I would\nnot give her to you, so I cannot break my oath, can I? If I did, the\ngood God would be avenged upon me.\"\n\n\"Some might think that when I came here the good God was in the way of\nbeing avenged upon you for the keeping of that evil oath,\" I answered\nbitterly, glancing, in my turn, at the graves.\n\n\"Yes, they might, Allan,\" he replied without anger, for all his troubles\nhad induced a reasonable frame of mind in him--for a while. \"Yet, His\nways are past finding out, are they not?\"\n\nNow my anger broke out, and, rising, I said:\n\n\"Do you mean, Mynheer Marais, that notwithstanding the love between us,\nwhich you know is true and deep, and notwithstanding that I alone have\nbeen able to drag both of you and the others out of the claws of death,\nI am never to marry Marie? Do you mean that she is to be given to a\nbraggart who deserted her in her need?\"\n\n\"And what if I do mean that, Allan?\"\n\n\"This: although I am still young, as you know well I am a man who can\nthink and act for himself. Also, I am your master here--I have cattle\nand guns and servants. Well, I will take Marie, and if any should try to\nstop me, I know how to protect myself and her.\"\n\nThis bold speech did not seem to surprise him in the least or to make\nhim think the worse of me. He looked at me for a while, pulling his long\nbeard in a meditative fashion, then answered:\n\n\"I dare say that at your age I should have played the same game, and\nit is true that you have things in your fist. But, much as she may love\nyou, Marie would not go away with you and leave her father to starve.\"\n\n\"Then you can come with us as my father-in-law, Mynheer Marais. At\nany rate, it is certain that I will not go away and leave her here to\nstarve.\"\n\nNow I think that something which he saw in my eye showed him that I was\nin earnest. At least, he changed his tone and began to argue, almost to\nplead.\n\n\"Be reasonable, Allan,\" he said. \"How can you marry Marie when there is\nno pr\u00e9dicant to marry you? Surely, if you love her so much, you would\nnot pour mud upon her name, even in this wilderness?\"\n\n\"She might not think it mud,\" I replied. \"Men and women have been\nmarried without the help of priests before now, by open declaration\nand public report, for instance, and their children held to be born in\nwedlock. I know that, for I have read of the law of marriage.\"\n\n\"It may be, Allan, though I hold no marriage good unless the holy words\nare said. But why do you not let me come to the end of my story?\"\n\n\"Because I thought it was ended, Mynheer Marais.\"\n\n\"Not so, Allan. I told you that I had sworn that she should never marry\nyou with my will. But when she is of age, which will be in some six\nmonths' time, my will counts no longer, seeing that then she is a free\nwoman who can dispose of herself. Also I shall be clear of my oath, for\nno harm will come to my soul if that happens which I cannot help. Now\nare you satisfied?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" I answered doubtfully, for somehow all Marais's\ncasuistry, which I thought contemptible, did not convince me that he was\nsincere. \"I don't know,\" I repeated. \"Much may chance in six months.\"\n\n\"Of course, Allan. For instance, Marie might change her mind and marry\nsomeone else.\"\n\n\"Or I might not be there to marry, mynheer. Accidents sometimes happen\nto men who are not wanted, especially in wild countries or, for the\nmatter of that, to those who are.\"\n\n\"Allemachte! Allan, you do not mean that I--\"\n\n\"No, mynheer,\" I interrupted; \"but there are other people in the world\nbesides yourself--Hernan Pereira, for example, if he lives. Still, I am\nnot the only one concerned in this matter. There is Marie yonder. Shall\nI call her?\"\n\nHe nodded, preferring probably that I should speak to her in his\npresence rather than alone.\n\nSo I called Marie, who was watching our talk somewhat anxiously while\nshe went about her tasks. She came at once, a very different Marie to\nthe starving girl of a while before, for although she was still thin\nand drawn, her youth and beauty were returning to her fast under the\ninfluences of good food and happiness.\n\n\"What is it, Allan?\" she asked gently. I told her all, repeating our\nconversation and the arguments which had been used on either side word\nfor word, as nearly as I could remember them.\n\n\"Is that right?\" I asked of Marais when I had finished.\n\n\"It is right; you have a good memory,\" he answered.\n\n\"Very well. And now what have you to say, Marie?\"\n\n\"I, dear Allan? Why, this: My life belongs to you, who have twice saved\nthis body of mine from death, as my love and spirit belong to you.\nTherefore, I should have thought it no shame if I had been given to you\nhere and now before the people, and afterwards married by a clergyman\nwhen we found one. But my father has sworn an oath which weighs upon\nhis mind, and he has shown you that within six months--a short six\nmonths--that oath dies of itself, since, by the law, he can no longer\ncontrol me. So, Allan, as I would not grieve him, or perhaps lead him to\nsay and do what is foolish, I think it would be well that we should wait\nfor those six months, if, on his part, he promises that he will then do\nnothing to prevent our marriage.\"\n\n\"Ja, ja, I promise that then I will do nothing to prevent your\nmarriage,\" answered Marais eagerly, like one who has suddenly seen some\nloophole of escape from an impossible position, adding, as though to\nhimself, \"But God may do something to prevent it, for all that.\"\n\n\"We are every one of us in the hand of God,\" she replied in her sweet\nvoice. \"Allan, you hear, my father has promised?\"\n\n\"Yes, Marie, he has promised--after a fashion,\" I replied gloomily, for\nsomehow his words struck a chill through me.\n\n\"I have promised, Allan, and I will keep my promise to you, as I have\nkept my oath to God, attempting to work you no harm, and leaving all in\nHis hands. But you, on your part, must promise also that, till she is of\nage, you will not take Marie as a wife--no, not if you were left alone\ntogether in the veld. You must be as people who are affianced to each\nother, no more.\"\n\nSo, having no choice, I promised, though with a heavy heart. Then, I\nsuppose in order to make this solemn contract public, Marais called the\nsurviving Boers, who were loitering near, and repeated to them the terms\nof the contract that we had made.\n\nThe men laughed and shrugged their shoulders. But Vrouw Prinsloo, I\nremember, said outright that she thought the business foolish, since if\nanyone had a right to Marie, I had, wherever I chose to take her. She\nadded that, as for Hernan Pereira, he was a \"sneak and a stinkcat,\" who\nhad gone off to save his own life, and left them all to die. If _she_\nwere Marie, should they meet again, she would greet him with a pailful\nof dirty water in the face, as she herself meant to do if she got the\nchance.\n\nVrouw Prinsloo, it will be observed, was a very outspoken woman and, I\nmay add, an honest one.\n\nSo this contract was settled. I have set it out at length because of\nits importance in our story. But now I wish--ah! how I wish that I had\ninsisted upon being married to Marie then and there. If I had done so,\nI think I should have carried my point, for I was the \"master of many\nlegions\" in the shape of cattle, food and ammunition, and rather than\nrisk a quarrel with me, the other Boers would have forced Marais to give\nway. But we were young and inexperienced; also it was fated otherwise.\nWho can question the decrees of Fate written immutably, perhaps long\nbefore we were born, in the everlasting book of human destinies?\n\nYet, when I had shaken off my first fears and doubts, my lot and Marie's\nwere very happy, a perfect paradise, indeed, compared with what we had\ngone through during that bitter time of silence and separation. At any\nrate, we were acknowledged to be affianced by the little society in\nwhich we lived, including her father, and allowed to be as much alone\ntogether as we liked. This meant that we met at dawn only to separate\nat nightfall, for, having little or no artificial light, we went to rest\nwith the sun, or shortly after it. Sweet, indeed, was that companionship\nof perfect trust and love; so sweet, that even after all these years I\ndo not care to dwell upon the holy memory of those blessed months.\n\nSo soon as the surviving Boers began to recover by the help of my stores\nand medicines and the meat which I shot in plenty, of course great\ndiscussions arose as to our future plans. First it was suggested that\nwe should trek to Lorenzo Marquez, and wait for a ship there to take us\ndown to Natal, for none of them would hear of returning beggared to the\nCape to tell the story of their failure and dreadful bereavements. I\npointed out, however, that no ship might come for a long while, perhaps\nfor one or two years, and that Lorenzo Marquez and its neighborhood\nseemed to be a poisonous place to live in!\n\nThe next idea was that we should stop where we were, one which I rather\nwelcomed, as I should have been glad to abide in peace with Marie until\nthe six months of probation had gone by.\n\nHowever, in the end this was rejected for many good reasons. Thus half\na score of white people, of whom four were members of a single family,\nwere certainly not strong enough to form a settlement, especially as the\nsurrounding natives might become actively hostile at any moment. Again,\nthe worst fever season was approaching, in which we should very possibly\nall be carried off. Further, we had no breeding cattle or horses, which\nwould not live in this veld, and only the ammunition and goods that I\nhad brought with me.\n\nSo it was clear that but one thing remained to be done, namely, to trek\nback to what is now the Transvaal territory, or, better still, to Natal,\nfor this route would enable us to avoid the worst of the mountains.\nThere we might join some other party of the emigrant Boers--for choice,\nthat of Retief, of whose arrival over the Drakensberg I was able to tell\nthem.\n\nThat point settled, we made our preparations. To begin with, I had only\nenough oxen for two wagons, whereas, even if we abandoned the rest\nof them, we must take at least four. Therefore, through my Kaffirs, I\nopened negotiations with the surrounding natives, who, when they heard\nthat I was not a Boer and was prepared to pay for what I bought, soon\nexpressed a willingness to trade. Indeed, very shortly we had quite a\nmarket established, to which cattle were brought that I bargained for\nand purchased, giving cloth, knives, hoes, and the usual Kaffir goods in\npayment for the same.\n\nAlso, they brought mealies and other corn; and oh! the delight with\nwhich those poor people, who for months and months had existed upon\nnothing but flesh-meat, ate of this farinaceous food. Never shall I\nforget seeing Marie and the surviving children partake of their first\nmeal of porridge, and washing the sticky stuff down with draughts of\nfresh, sugared milk, for with the oxen I had succeeded in obtaining two\ngood cows. It is enough to say that this change of diet soon completely\nre-established their health, and made Marie more beautiful than she had\never been before.\n\nHaving got the oxen, the next thing was to break them to the yoke; for,\nalthough docile creatures enough, they had never even seen a wagon.\nThis proved a long and difficult process, involving many trial trips;\nmoreover, the selected wagons, one of which had belonged to Pereira,\nmust be mended with very insufficient tools and without the help of a\nforge. Indeed, had it not chanced that Hans, the Hottentot, had worked\nfor a wagon-maker at some indefinite period of his career, I do not\nthink that we could have managed the job at all.\n\nIt was while we were busy with these tasks that some news arrived which\nwas unpleasing enough to everyone, except perhaps to Henri Marais. I\nwas engaged on a certain evening in trying to make sixteen of the Kaffir\ncattle pull together in the yoke, instead of tying themselves into a\ndouble knot and over-setting the wagon, when Hans, who was helping me,\nsuddenly called out:\n\n\"Look! baas, here comes one of my brothers,\" or, in other words, a\nHottentot.\n\nFollowing the line of his hand, I saw a thin and wretched creature,\nclad only in some rags and the remains of a big hat with the crown out,\nstaggering towards us between the trees.\n\n\"Why!\" exclaimed Marie in a startled voice, for, as usual, she was at my\nside, \"it is Klaus, one of my cousin Hernan's after-riders.\"\n\n\"So long as it is not your cousin Hernan himself, I do not care,\" I\nsaid.\n\nPresently the poor, starved \"Totty\" arrived, and throwing himself down,\nbegged for food. A cold shoulder of buck was given to him, which he\ndevoured, holding it in both hands and tearing off great lumps of flesh\nwith his teeth like a wild beast.\n\nWhen at last he was satisfied, Marais, who had come up with the other\nBoers, asked him whence he came and what was his news of his master.\n\n\"Out of the bush,\" he answered, \"and my news of the baas is that he\nis dead. At least, I left him so ill that I suppose he must be dead by\nnow.\"\n\n\"Why did you leave him if he was ill?\" asked Marais.\n\n\"Because he told me to, baas, that I might find help, for we were\nstarving, having fired our last bullet.\"\n\n\"Is he alone, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, except for the wild beasts and the vultures. A lion ate the\nother man, his servant, a long while ago.\"\n\n\"How far is he off?\" asked Marais again.\n\n\"Oh, baas, about five hours' journey on horseback on a good road.\" (This\nwould be some thirty-five miles.)\n\nThen he told this story: Pereira with his two Hottentot servants, he\nmounted and they on foot, had traversed about a hundred miles of rough\ncountry in safety, when at night a lion killed and carried off one of\nthe Hottentots, and frightened away the horse, which was never seen\nagain. Pereira and Klaus proceeded on foot till they came to a great\nriver, on the banks of which they met some Kaffirs, who appear to have\nbeen Zulus on outpost duty. These men demanded their guns and ammunition\nto take to their king, and, on Pereira refusing to give them up, said\nthat they would kill them both in the morning after they had made him\ninstruct them in the use of the guns by beating him with sticks.\n\nIn the night a storm came on, under cover of which Pereira and Klaus\nescaped. As they dared not go forward for fear lest they should fall\ninto the hands of the Zulus, they fled back northwards, running all\nnight, only to find in the morning that they had lost their way in the\nbush. This had happened nearly a month before--or, at any rate, Klaus\nthought so, for no doubt the days went very slowly--during which time\nthey had wandered about, trying to shape some sort of course by the\nsun with the object of returning to the camp. They met no man, black or\nwhite, and supported themselves upon game, which they shot and ate raw\nor sun-dried, till at length all their powder was done and they threw\naway their heavy roers, which they could no longer carry.\n\nIt was at this juncture that from the top of a tall tree Klaus saw\na certain koppie a long way off, which he recognised as being within\nfifteen miles or so of Marais's camp. By now they were starving, only\nKlaus was the stronger of the two, for he found and devoured some\ncarrion, a dead hyena I think it was. Pereira also tried to eat this\nhorrible food, but, not having the stomach of a Hottentot, the first\nmouthful of it made him dreadfully ill. They sought shelter in a cave on\nthe bank of a stream, where grew water-cresses and other herbs, such as\nwild asparagus. Here it was that Pereira told Klaus to try to make his\nway back to the camp, and, should he find anyone alive there, to bring\nhim succour.\n\nSo Klaus went, taking the remaining leg of the hyena with him, and on\nthe afternoon of the second day arrived as has been told.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. VROUW PRINSLOO SPEAKS HER MIND\n\n\nNow, when the Hottentot's story was finished a discussion arose. Marais\nsaid that someone must go to see whether his nephew still lived, to\nwhich the other Boers replied \"Ja\" in an indifferent voice. Then the\nVrouw Prinsloo took up her parable.\n\nShe remarked, as she had done before, that in her judgment Hernan\nPereira was \"a stinkcat and a sneak,\" who had tried to desert them in\ntheir trouble, and by the judgment of a just God had got into trouble\nhimself. Personally, she wished that the lion had taken him instead of\nthe worthy Hottentot, although it gave her a higher opinion of lions to\nconclude that it had not done so, because if it did it thought it would\nhave been poisoned. Well, her view was that it would be just as well to\nlet that traitor lie upon the bed which he had made. Moreover, doubtless\nby now he was dead, so what was the good of bothering about him?\n\nThese sentiments appeared to appeal to the Boers, for they remarked:\n\"Ja, what is the good?\"\n\n\"Is it right,\" asked Marais, \"to abandon a comrade in misfortune, one of\nour own blood?\"\n\n\"Mein Gott!\" replied Vrouw Prinsloo; \"he is no blood of mine, the\nevil-odoured Portuguee. But I admit he is of yours, Heer Marais, being\nyour sister's son, so it is evident that you should be the one to go to\nseek after him.\"\n\n\"That seems to be so, Vrouw Prinsloo,\" said Marais in his meditative\nmanner; \"yet I must remember that I have Marie to look after.\"\n\n\"Ach! and so had he, too, until he remembered his own skin, and went off\nwith the only horse and all the powder, leaving her and the rest of us\nto starve. Well, you won't go, and Prinsloo won't go, nor my boy either,\nfor I'll see to that; so Meyer must go.\"\n\n\"Nein, nein, good vrouw,\" answered Meyer, \"I have those children that\nare left to me to consider.\"\n\n\"Then,\" exclaimed Vrouw Prinsloo triumphantly, \"nobody will go, so let\nus forget this stinkcat, as he forgot us.\"\n\n\"Does it seem right,\" asked Marais again, \"that a Christian man should\nbe left to starve in the wilderness?\" and he looked at me.\n\n\"Tell me, Heer Marais,\" I remarked, answering the look, \"why should I\nof all people go to look for the Heer Pereira, one who has not dealt too\nwell with me?\"\n\n\"I do not know, Allan. Yet the Book tells us to turn the other cheek and\nto forget injuries. Still, it is for you to judge, remembering that we\nmust answer for all things at the last day, and not for me. I only know\nthat were I your age and not burdened with a daughter to watch over, _I_\nshould go.\"\n\n\"Why should you talk to me thus?\" I asked with indignation. \"Why do\nyou not go yourself, seeing that I am quite ready to look after Marie?\"\n(Here the Vrouw Prinsloo and the other Boers tittered.) \"And why do you\nnot address your remarks to these other heeren instead of to me, seeing\nthat they are the friends and trek-companions of your nephew?\"\n\nAt this point the male Prinsloos and Meyer found that they had business\nelsewhere.\n\n\"It is for you to judge, yet remember, Allan, that it is an awful thing\nto appear before our Maker with the blood of a fellow creature upon our\nhands. But if you and these other hard-hearted men will not go, I at my\nage, and weak as I am with all that I have suffered, will go myself.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Vrouw Prinsloo; \"that is the best way out of it. You will\nsoon get sick of the journey, Heer Marais, and we shall see no more of\nthe stinkcat.\"\n\nMarais rose in a resigned fashion, for he never deigned to argue with\nVrouw Prinsloo, who was too many for him, and said:\n\n\"Farewell, Marie. If I do not return, you will remember my wishes, and\nmy will may be found between the first leaves of our Holy Book. Get\nup, Klaus, and guide me to your master,\" and he administered a somewhat\nvicious kick to the gorged and prostrate Hottentot.\n\nNow Marie, who all this while had stood silent, touched me on the\nshoulder and said:\n\n\"Allan, is it well that my father should go alone? Will you not\naccompany him?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" I answered cheerfully; \"on such a business there should be\ntwo, and some Kaffirs also to carry the man, if he still lives.\"\n\nNow for the end of the story. As the Hottentot Klaus was too exhausted\nto move that night, it was arranged that we should start at dawn.\nAccordingly, I rose before the light, and was just finishing my\nbreakfast when Marie appeared at the wagon in which I slept. I got up\nto greet her, and, there being no one in sight, we kissed each other\nseveral times.\n\n\"Have done, my heart,\" she said, pushing me away. \"I come to you from my\nfather, who is sick in his stomach and would see you.\"\n\n\"Which means that I shall have to go after your cousin alone,\" I replied\nwith indignant emphasis.\n\nShe shook her head, and led me to the little shanty in which she slept.\nHere by the growing light, that entered through the doorway for it had\nno window, I perceived Marais seated upon a wooden stool with his hands\npressed on his middle and groaning.\n\n\"Good morning, Allan,\" he said in a melancholy voice; \"I am ill, very\nill, something that I have eaten perhaps, or a chill in the stomach,\nsuch as often precedes fever or dysentery.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you will get better as you walk, mynheer,\" I suggested, for,\nto tell the truth, I misdoubted me of this chill, and knew that he had\neaten nothing but what was quite wholesome.\n\n\"Walk! God alone knows how I can walk with something gripping my inside\nlike a wagon-maker's vice. Yet I will try, for it is impossible to leave\nthat poor Hernan to die alone; and if I do not go to seek him, it seems\nthat no one else will.\"\n\n\"Why should not some of my Kaffirs go with Klaus?\" I asked.\n\n\"Allan,\" he replied solemnly, \"if you were dying in a cave far from\nhelp, would you think well of those who sent raw Kaffirs to succour you\nwhen they might have come themselves, Kaffirs who certainly would let\nyou die and return with some false story?\"\n\n\"I don't know what I should think, Heer Marais. But I do know that if\n_I_ were in that cave and Pereira were in this camp, neither would he\ncome himself, nor so much as send a savage to save _me_.\"\n\n\"It may be so, Allan. But even if another's heart is black, should yours\nbe black also? Oh! I will come, though it be to my death,\" and, rising\nfrom the stool with the most dreadful groan, he began to divest himself\nof the tattered blanket in which he was wrapped up.\n\n\"Oh! Allan, my father must not go; it will kill him,\" exclaimed Marie,\nwho took a more serious view of his case than I did.\n\n\"Very well, if you think so,\" I answered. \"And now, as it is time for me\nto be starting, good-bye.\"\n\n\"You have a good heart, Allan,\" said Marais, sinking back upon his stool\nand resuming his blanket, while Marie looked despairingly first at one\nand then at the other of us.\n\nHalf an hour later I was on the road in the very worst of tempers.\n\n\"Mind what you are about,\" called Vrouw Prinsloo after me. \"It is not\nlucky to save an enemy, and if I know anything of that stinkcat, he will\nbite your finger badly by way of gratitude. Bah! lad, if I were you I\nshould just camp for a few days in the bush, and then come back and say\nthat I could find nothing of Pereira except the dead hyenas that had\nbeen poisoned by eating him. Good luck to you all the same, Allan; may\nI find such a friend in need. It seems to me that you were born to help\nothers.\"\n\nBeside the Hottentot Klaus, my companions on this unwelcome journey were\nthree of the Zulu Kaffirs, for Hans I was obliged to leave in charge\nof my cattle and goods with the other men. Also, I took a pack-ox, an\nactive beast that I had been training to carry loads and, if necessary a\nman, although as yet it was not very well broken.\n\nAll that day we marched over extremely rough country, till at last\ndarkness found us in a mountainous kloof, where we slept, surrounded\nby watch-fires because of the lions. Next morning at the first light we\nmoved on again, and about ten o'clock waded through a stream to a little\nnatural cave, where Klaus said he had left his master. This cave seemed\nextremely silent, and, as I hesitated for a moment at its mouth, the\nthought crossed my mind that if Pereira were still there, he must be\ndead. Indeed, do what I would to suppress it, with that reflection came\na certain feeling of relief and even of pleasure. For well I knew that\nPereira alive was more dangerous to me than all the wild men and beasts\nin Africa put together. Thrusting back this unworthy sentiment as best\nI could, I entered the cave alone, for the natives, who dread the\ndefilement of the touch of a corpse, lingered outside.\n\nIt was but a shallow cavity washed out of the overhanging rock by the\naction of water; and as soon as my eyes grew accustomed to its gloom, I\nsaw that at the end of it lay a man. So still did he lie, that now I was\nalmost certain that his troubles were over. I went up to him and touched\nhis face, which was cold and clammy, and then, quite convinced, turned\nto leave the place, which, I thought, if a few rocks were piled in the\nmouth of it, would make an excellent sepulchre.\n\nJust as I stepped out into the sunlight, and was about to call to the\nmen to collect the rocks, however, I thought that I heard a very faint\ngroan behind me, which at the moment I set down to imagination. Still, I\nreturned, though I did not much like the job, knelt down by the figure,\nand waited with my hand over its heart. For five minutes or more I\nstayed here, and then, quite convinced, was about to leave again when,\nfor the second time, I heard that faint groan. Pereira was not dead, but\nonly on the extreme brink of death!\n\nI ran to the entrance of the cave, calling the Kaffirs, and together we\ncarried him out into the sunlight. He was an awful spectacle, mere bone\nwith yellow skin stretched over it, and covered with filth and clotted\nblood from some hurt. I had brandy with me, of which I poured a little\ndown his throat, whereon his heart began to beat feebly. Then we made\nsome soup, and poured that down his throat with more brandy, and the end\nof it was he came to life again.\n\nFor three days did I doctor that man, and really I believe that if at\nany time during those days I had relaxed my attentions even for a couple\nof hours, he would have slipped through my fingers, for at this business\nKlaus and the Kaffirs were no good at all. But I pulled him round, and\non the third morning he came to his senses. For a long while he stared\nat me, for I had laid him in the mouth of the cave, where the light was\ngood, although the overhanging rocks protected him from the sun. Then he\nsaid:\n\n\"Allemachte! you remind me of someone, young man. I know. It is of\nthat damned English boy who beat me at the goose shooting, and made me\nquarrel with Oom [uncle] Retief, the jackanapes that Marie was so fond\nof. Well, whoever you are, you can't be he, thank God.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, Heer Pereira,\" I answered. \"I am that same damned\nyoung English jackanapes, Allan Quatermain by name, who beat you at\nshooting. But if you take my advice, you will thank God for something\nelse, namely, that your life has been saved.\"\n\n\"Who saved it?\" he asked.\n\n\"If you want to know, I did; I have been nursing you these three days.\"\n\n\"You, Allan Quatermain! Now, that is strange, for certainly I would not\nhave saved yours,\" and he laughed a little, then turned over and went to\nsleep.\n\nFrom that time forward his recovery was rapid, and two days later we\nbegan our journey back to Marais's camp, the convalescent Pereira being\ncarried in a litter by the four natives. It was a task at which they\ngrumbled a good deal, for the load was heavy over rough ground, and\nwhenever they stumbled or shook him he cursed at them. So much did\nhe curse, indeed, that at length one of the Zulus, a man with a rough\ntemper, said that if it were not for the Inkoos, meaning myself, he\nwould put his assegai through him, and let the vultures carry him. After\nthis Pereira grew much more polite. When the bearers became exhausted\nwe set him on the pack-ox, which two of us led, while the other two\nsupported him on either side. It was in this fashion that at last we\narrived at the camp one evening.\n\nHere the Vrouw Prinsloo was the first to greet us. We found her standing\nin the game path which we were following, quite a quarter of a mile from\nthe wagons, with her hands set upon her broad hips and her feet\napart. Her attitude was so defiant, and had about it such an air of\npremeditation, that I cannot help thinking she had got wind of our\nreturn, perhaps from having seen the smoke of our last fires, and was\nwatching for us. Also, her greeting was warm.\n\n\"Ah! here you come, Hernan Pereira,\" she cried, \"riding on an ox, while\nbetter men walk. Well, now, I want a chat with you. How came it that you\nwent off in the night, taking the only horse and all the powder?\"\n\n\"I went to get help for you,\" he replied sulkily.\n\n\"Did you, did you, indeed! Well, it seems that it was you who wanted the\nhelp, after all. What do you mean to pay the Heer Allan Quatermain for\nsaving your life, for I am sure he has done so? You have got no goods\nleft, although you were always boasting about your riches; they are now\nat the bottom of a river, so it will have to be in love and service.\"\n\nHe muttered something about my wanting no payment for a Christian act.\n\n\"No, he wants no payment, Hernan Pereira, he is one of the true sort,\nbut you'll pay him all the same and in bad coin if you get the chance.\nOh! I have come out to tell you what I think of you. You are a stinkcat;\ndo you hear that? A thing that no dog would bite if he could help it!\nYou are a traitor also. You brought us to this cursed country, where\nyou said your relatives would give us wealth and land, and then, after\nfamine and fever attacked us, you rode away, and left us to die to save\nyour own dirty skin. And now you come back here for help, saved by him\nwhom you cheated in the Goose Kloof, by him whose true love you have\ntried to steal. Oh, mein Gott! why does the Almighty leave such fellows\nalive, while so many that are good and honest and innocent lie beneath\nthe soil because of stinkcats like you?\"\n\nSo she went on, striding at the side of the pack-ox, and reviling\nPereira in a ceaseless stream of language, until at length he thrust his\nthumbs into his ears and glared at her in speechless wrath.\n\nThus it was that at last we arrived in the camp, where, having seen\nus coming, all the Boers were gathered. They are not a particularly\nhumorous people, but this spectacle of the advance of Pereira seated on\nthe pack-ox, a steed that is becoming to few riders, with the furious\nand portly Vrouw Prinsloo striding at his side and shrieking abuse at\nhim, caused them to burst into laughter. Then Pereira's temper gave out,\nand he became even more abusive than Vrouw Prinsloo.\n\n\"Is this the way you receive me, you veld-hogs, you common Boers, who\nare not fit to mix with a man of position and learning like myself?\" he\nbegan.\n\n\"Then in God's name why do you mix with us, Hernan Pereira?\" asked the\nsaturnine Meyer, thrusting his face forward till the Newgate fringe he\nwore by way of a beard literally seemed to curl with wrath. \"When we\nwere hungry you did not wish it, for you slunk away and left us, taking\nall the powder. But now that we are full again, thanks to the little\nEnglishman, and you are hungry, you come back. Well, if I had my way I\nwould give you a gun and six days' rations, and turn you out to shift\nfor yourself.\"\n\n\"Don't be afraid, Jan Meyer,\" shouted Pereira from the back of the\npack-ox. \"As soon as I am strong enough I will leave you in charge of\nyour English captain here\"--and he pointed to me--\"and go to tell our\npeople what sort of folk you are.\"\n\n\"That is good news,\" interrupted Prinsloo, a stolid old Boer, who stood\nby puffing at his pipe. \"Get well, get well as soon as you can, Hernan\nPereira.\"\n\nIt was at this juncture that Marais arrived, accompanied by Marie. Where\nhe came from I do not know, but I think he must have been keeping in the\nbackground on purpose to see what kind of a reception Pereira would meet\nwith.\n\n\"Silence, brothers,\" he said. \"Is this the way you greet my nephew, who\nhas returned from the gate of death, when you should be on your knees\nthanking God for his deliverance?\"\n\n\"Then go on your knees and thank Him yourself, Henri Marais,\" screamed\nthe irrepressible Vrouw Prinsloo. \"I give thanks for the safe return of\nAllan here, though it is true they would be warmer if he had left this\nstinkcat behind him. Allemachte! Henri Marais, why do you make so much\nof this Portuguese fellow? Has he bewitched you? Or is it because he\nis your sister's son, or because you want to force Marie there to marry\nhim? Or is it, perhaps, that he knows of something bad in your past\nlife, and you have to bribe him to keep his mouth shut?\"\n\nNow, whether this last unpleasant suggestion was a mere random arrow\ndrawn from Vrouw Prinsloo's well-stored quiver, or whether the vrouw had\ngot hold of the tail-end of some long-buried truth, I do not know. Of\ncourse, however, the latter explanation is possible. Many men have done\nthings in their youth which they do not wish to see dug up in their\nage; and Pereira may have learned a family secret of the kind from his\nmother.\n\nAt any rate, the effect of the old lady's words upon Marais was quite\nremarkable. Suddenly he went into one of his violent and constitutional\nrages. He cursed Vrouw Prinsloo. He cursed everybody else, assuring them\nseverally and collectively that Heaven would come even with them. He\nsaid there was a plot against him and his nephew, and that I was at the\nbottom of it, I who had made his daughter fond of my ugly little face.\nSo furious were his words, whereof there were many more which I have\nforgotten, that at length Marie began to cry and ran away. Presently,\ntoo, the Boers strolled off, shrugging their shoulders, one of them\nsaying audibly that Marais had gone quite mad at last, as he always\nthought he would.\n\nThen Marais followed them, throwing up his arms and still cursing as he\nwent, and, slipping over the tail of the pack-ox, Pereira followed him.\nSo the Vrouw Prinsloo and I were left alone, for the coloured men had\ndeparted, as they always do when white people begin to quarrel.\n\n\"There, Allan, my boy,\" said the vrouw in triumph, \"I have found the\nsore place on the mule's back, and didn't I make him squeal and kick,\nalthough on most days of the week he seems to be such a good and quiet\nmule--at any rate, of late.\"\n\n\"I dare say you did, vrouw,\" I said wrathfully, \"but I wish you would\nleave Mynheer Marais's sore places alone, seeing that if the squeals are\nfor you, the kicks are for me.\"\n\n\"What does that matter, Allan?\" she asked. \"He always was your enemy,\nso that it is just as well you should see his heels when you are out\nof reach of them. My poor boy, I think you will have a bad time of it\nbetween the stinkcat and the mule, although you have done so much for\nboth of them. Well, there is one thing--Marie has a true heart. She will\nnever marry any man except yourself, Allan--even if you are not here to\nmarry,\" she added by an afterthought.\n\nThe old lady paused a little, staring at the ground. Then she looked up\nand said:\n\n\"Allan, my dear\" (for she was really fond of me, and called me thus\nat times), \"you didn't take the advice I gave you, namely, to look for\nPereira and not to find him. Well, I will give you some more, which you\n_will_ take if you are wise.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked doubtfully; for, although she was upright enough\nin her own way, the Vrouw Prinsloo could bring herself to look at things\nin strange lights. Like many other women, she judged of moral codes by\nthe impulses of her heart, and was quite prepared to stretch them\nto suit circumstances or to gain an end which she considered good in\nitself.\n\n\"Just this, lad. Do you make a two days' march with Marie into the bush.\nI want a little change, so I will come, too, and marry you there; for I\nhave got a prayer-book, and can spell out the service if we go through\nit once or twice first.\"\n\nNow, the vision of Marie and myself being married by the Vrouw Prinsloo\nin the vast and untrodden veld, although attractive, was so absurd that\nI laughed.\n\n\"Why do you laugh, Allan? Anyone can marry people if there is no one\nelse there; indeed, I believe that they can marry themselves.\"\n\n\"I dare say,\" I answered, not wishing to enter into a legal argument\nwith the vrouw. \"But you see, Tante, I solemnly promised her father that\nI would not marry her until she was of age, and if I broke my word I\nshould not be an honest man.\"\n\n\"An honest man!\" she exclaimed with the utmost contempt; \"an honest man!\nWell, are Marais and Hernan Pereira honest men? Why do you not cut your\nstick the same length as theirs, Allan Quatermain? I tell you that your\nverdomde honesty will be your ruin. You remember my words later on,\" and\nshe marched off in high dudgeon.\n\nWhen she had gone I went to my wagons, where Hans was waiting for me\nwith a detailed and interminable report of everything that had happened\nin my absence. Glad was I to find that, except for the death of one\nsickly ox, nothing had gone wrong. When at length he had ended his long\nstory, I ate some food which Marie sent over for me ready cooked, for\nI was too tired to join any of the Boers that night. Just as I had\nfinished my meal and was thinking of turning in, Marie herself appeared\nwithin the circle of the camp-fire's light. I sprang up and ran to her,\nsaying that I had not expected to see her that evening, and did not like\nto come to the house.\n\n\"No,\" she answered, drawing me back into the shadows, \"I understand.\nMy father seems very much upset, almost mad, indeed. If the Vrouw\nPrinsloo's tongue had been a snake's fang, it could not have stung him\nworse.\"\n\n\"And where is Pereira?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh! my cousin sleeps in the other room. He is weak and worn out. All\nthe same, Allan, he wanted to kiss me. So I told him at once how matters\nstood between you and me, and that we were to be married in six months.\"\n\n\"What did he say to that?\" I asked.\n\n\"He turned to my father and said: 'Is this true, my uncle?' And my\nfather answered: 'Yes, that is the best bargain I could make with the\nEnglishman, seeing that you were not here to make a better.'\"\n\n\"And what happened then, Marie?\"\n\n\"Oh, then Hernan thought a while. At last he looked up and said: 'I\nunderstand. Things have gone badly. I acted for the best, who went away\nto try to find help for all of you. I failed. Meanwhile the Englishman\ncame and saved you. Afterwards he saved me also. Uncle, in all this\nI see God's hand; had it not been for this Allan none of us would be\nalive. Yes, God used him that we might be kept alive. Well, he has\npromised that he will not marry Marie for six months. And you know,\nmy uncle, that some of these English are great fools; they keep their\npromises even to their own loss. Now, in six months much may happen; who\nknows what will happen?'\"\n\n\"Were you present when you heard all this, Marie?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, Allan; I was the other side of the reed partition. But at\nthose words I entered and said: 'My father and Cousin Hernan, please\nunderstand that there is one thing which will never happen.'\n\n\"'What is that?' asked my cousin.\n\n\"'It will never happen that I shall marry you, Hernan,' I replied.\n\n\"'Who knows, Marie, who knows?' he said.\n\n\"'I do, Hernan,' I answered. 'Even if Allan were to die to-morrow, I\nwould not marry you, either then or twenty years hence. I am glad that\nhe has saved your life, but henceforth we are cousins, nothing more.'\n\n\"'You hear what the girl tells us,' said my father; 'why do you not give\nup the business? What is the use of kicking against the pricks?'\n\n\"'If one wears stout boots and kicks hard enough, the pricks give way,'\nsaid Hernan. 'Six months is a long time, my uncle.'\n\n\"'It may be so, cousin,' I said; 'but remember that neither six months\nnor six years, nor six thousand years, are long enough to make me marry\nany man except Allan Quatermain, who has just rescued you from death. Do\nyou understand?'\n\n\"'Yes,' he replied, 'I understand that you will not marry me. Only then\nI promise that you shall not marry either Allan Quatermain or any other\nman.'\n\n\"'God will decide that,' I answered, and came away, leaving him and my\nfather together. And now, Allan, tell me all that has happened since we\nparted.\"\n\nSo I told her everything, including the Vrouw Prinsloo's advice.\n\n\"Of course, Allan, you were quite right,\" she remarked when I had\nfinished; \"but I am not sure that the Vrouw Prinsloo was not also right\nin her own fashion. I am afraid of my cousin Hernan, who holds my father\nin his hand--fast, fast. Still, we have promised, and must keep our\nword.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. THE SHOT IN THE KLOOF\n\n\nI think it was about three weeks after these events that we began our\nsouthward trek. On the morning subsequent to our arrival at Marais's\ncamp, Pereira came up to me when several people were present, and,\ntaking my hand, thanked me in a loud voice for having saved his life.\nThenceforward, he declared, I should be dearer to him than a brother,\nfor was there not a blood bond between us?\n\nI answered I did not think any such bond existed; indeed, I was not sure\nwhat it meant. I had done my duty by him, neither less nor more, and\nthere was nothing further to be said.\n\nIt turned out, however, that there was a great deal further to be said,\nsince Pereira desired to borrow money, or, rather, goods, from me. He\nexplained that owing to the prejudices of the vulgar Boers who remained\nalive in that camp, and especially of the scandalous-tongued Vrouw\nPrinsloo, both he and his uncle had come to the conclusion that it would\nbe wise for him to remove himself as soon as possible. Therefore he\nproposed to trek away alone.\n\nI answered that I should have thought he had done enough solitary\ntravelling in this veld, seeing how his last expedition had ended. He\nreplied that he had, indeed, but everyone here was so bitter against him\nthat no choice was left. Then he added with an outburst of truth:\n\n\"Allemachte! Mynheer Quatermain, do you suppose that it is pleasant for\nme to see you making love all day to the maid who was my betrothed, and\nto see her paying back the love with her eyes? Yes, and doubtless with\nher lips, too, from all I hear.\"\n\n\"You could leave her whom you called your betrothed, but who never was\nbetrothed to anyone but me with her own will, to starve in the veld,\nmynheer. Why, then, should you be angry because I picked up that which\nyou threw away, that, too, which was always my own and not yours? Had it\nnot been for me, there would now be no maid left for us to quarrel over,\nas, had it not been for me, there would be no man left for me to quarrel\nwith about the maid.\"\n\n\"Are you God, then, Englishman, that you dispose of the lives of men and\nwomen at your will? It was He Who saved us, not you.\"\n\n\"He may have saved you, but it was through me. I carried out the rescue\nof these poor people whom you deserted, and I nursed you back to life.\"\n\n\"I did not desert them; I went to get help for them.\"\n\n\"Taking all the powder and the only horse with you! Well, that is done\nwith, and now you want to borrow goods to pay for cattle--from me, whom\nyou hate. You are not proud, Mynheer Pereira, when you have an end\nto serve, whatever that end may be,\" and I looked at him. My instinct\nwarned me against this false and treacherous man, who, I felt, was even\nthen plotting in his heart to bring some evil upon me.\n\n\"No, I am not proud. Why should I be, seeing that I mean to repay you\ntwice over for anything which you may lend me now?\"\n\nI reflected a while. Certainly our journey to Natal would be pleasanter\nif Pereira were not of the company. Also, if he went with us, I was sure\nthat before we came to the end of that trek, one or other of us would\nleave his bones on the road. In short, not to put too fine a point on\nit, I feared lest in this way or in that he would bring me to my death\nin order that he might possess himself of Marie. We were in a wild\ncountry, with few witnesses and no law courts, where such deeds might\nbe done again and again and the doer never called to account for lack of\nevidence and judges.\n\nSo I made up my mind to fall in with his wishes, and we began to\nbargain. The end of it was that I advanced him enough of my remaining\ngoods to buy the cattle he required from the surrounding natives. It was\nno great quantity, after all, seeing that in this uncivilised place\nan ox could be purchased for a few strings of beads or a cheap knife.\nFurther, I sold him a few of the beasts that I had broken, a gun, some\nammunition and certain other necessaries, for all of which things he\ngave me a note of hand written in my pocket-book. Indeed, I did more;\nfor as none of the Boers would help him I assisted Pereira to break in\nthe cattle he bought, and even consented when he asked me to give him\nthe services of two of the Zulus whom I had hired.\n\nAll these preparations took a long while. If I remember right, twelve\nmore days had gone by before Pereira finally trekked off from Marais's\ncamp, by which time he was quite well and strong again.\n\nWe all assembled to see the start, and Marais offered up a prayer for\nhis nephew's safe journey and our happy meeting again in Natal at the\nlaager of Retief, which was to be our rendezvous, if that leader were\nstill in Natal. No one else joined in the prayer. Only Vrouw Prinsloo\naudibly added another of her own. It was to the effect that he might not\ncome back a second time, and that she might never see his face again,\neither at Retief's laager or anywhere else, if it would please the good\nLord so to arrange matters.\n\nThe Boers tittered; even the Meyer children tittered, for by this time\nthe hatred of the Vrouw Prinsloo for Hernan Pereira was the joke of the\nplace. But Pereira himself pretended not to hear, said good-bye to us\nall affectionately, adding a special petition for the Vrouw Prinsloo,\nand off we went.\n\nI say \"we went\" because with my usual luck, to help him with the\nhalf-broken oxen, I was commandeered to accompany this man to his first\noutspan, a place with good water about twelve miles from the camp, where\nhe proposed to remain for the night.\n\nNow, as we started about ten o'clock in the morning and the veld was\nfairly level, I expected that we should reach this outspan by three\nor four in the afternoon, which would give me time to walk back before\nsunset. In fact, however, so many accidents happened of one sort or\nanother, both to the wagon itself, of which the woodwork had shrunk with\nlong standing in the sun, and to the cattle, which, being unused to the\nyoke, tied themselves in a double knot upon every opportunity, that we\nonly arrived there at the approach of night.\n\nThe last mile of that trek was through a narrow gorge cut out by water\nin the native rock. Here trees grew sparsely, also great ferns, but the\nbottom of the gorge, along which game were accustomed to travel, was\nsmooth enough for wagons, save for a few fallen boulders, which it was\nnecessary to avoid.\n\nWhen at length we reached the outspan I asked the Hottentot, Klaus, who\nwas assisting me to drive the team, where his master was, for I could\nnot see him anywhere. He answered that he had gone back down the kloof\nto look for something that had fallen from the wagon, a bolt I think he\nsaid.\n\n\"Very good,\" I replied. \"Then tell him, if we do not meet, that I have\nreturned to the camp.\"\n\nAs I set out the sun was sinking below the horizon, but this did not\ntrouble me overmuch, as I had a rifle with me, that same light rifle\nwith which I had shot the geese in the great match. Also I knew that the\nmoon, being full, would be up presently.\n\nThe sun sank, and the kloof was plunged in gloom. The place seemed\neerie and lonesome, and suddenly I grew afraid. I began to wonder where\nPereira was, and what he might be doing. I even thought of turning\nback and finding some way round, only having explored all this district\npretty thoroughly in my various shooting expeditions from the camp, I\nknew there was no practicable path across those hills. So I went on\nwith my rifle at full cock, whistling to keep up my courage, which, of\ncourse, in the circumstances was a foolish thing to do. It occurred to\nme at the time that it was foolish, but, in truth, I would not give way\nto the dark suspicions which crossed my mind. Doubtless by now Pereira\nhad passed me and reached the outspan.\n\nThe moon began to shine--that wonderful African moon, which turns night\nto day--throwing a network of long, black shadows of trees and\nrocks across the game track I was following. Right ahead of me was a\nparticularly dark patch of this shadow, caused by a projecting wall of\ncliff, and beyond it an equally bright patch of moonlight. Somehow I\nmisdoubted me of that stretch of gloom, for although, of course, I could\nsee nothing there, my quick ear caught the sound of movements.\n\nI halted for a moment. Then, reflecting that these were doubtless caused\nby some night-walking creature, which, even should it chance to be\ndangerous, would flee at the approach of man, I plunged into it boldly.\nAs I emerged at the other end--the shadow was eighteen or twenty paces\nlong--it occurred to me that if any enemy were lurking there, I should\nbe an easy target as I entered the line of clear light. So, almost\ninstinctively, for I do not remember that I reasoned the thing out,\nafter my first two steps forward in the light I gave a little spring to\nthe left, where there was still shadow, although it was not deep. Well\nwas it for me that I did so, for at that moment I felt something touch\nmy cheek and heard the loud report of a gun immediately behind me.\n\nNow, the wisest course would have been for me to run before whoever\nhad fired found time to reload. But a kind of fury seized me, and run I\nwould not. On the contrary, I turned with a shout, and charged back into\nthe shadow. Something heard me coming, something fled in front of me. In\na few seconds we were out into the moonlight beyond, and, as I expected,\nI saw that this something was a man--Pereira!\n\nHe halted and wheeled round, lifting the stock of his gun, club fashion.\n\n\"Thank God! it is you, Heer Allan,\" he said; \"I thought you were a\ntiger.\"\n\n\"Then it is your last thought, murderer,\" I answered, raising my rifle.\n\n\"Don't shoot,\" he said. \"Would you have my blood upon you? Why do you\nwant to kill me?\"\n\n\"Why did you try to kill me?\" I answered, covering him.\n\n\"I try to kill you! Are you mad? Listen, for your own sake. I sat down\non the bank yonder waiting for the moon, and, being tired, fell asleep.\nThen I woke up with a start, and, thinking from the sounds that a tiger\nwas after me, fired to scare it. Allemachte! man, if I had aimed at you,\ncould I have missed at that distance?\"\n\n\"You did not quite miss, and had I not stepped to the left, you would\nhave blown my head off. Say your prayers, you dog!\"\n\n\"Allan Quatermain,\" he exclaimed with desperate energy, \"you think I\nlie, who speak the truth. Kill me if you will, only then remember that\nyou will hang for it. We court one woman, that is known, and who will\nbelieve this story of yours that I tried to shoot you? Soon the Kaffirs\nwill come to look for me, probably they are starting already, and will\nfind my body with your bullet in my heart. Then they will take it back\nto Marais's camp, and I say--who will believe your story?\"\n\n\"Some, I think, murderer,\" but as I spoke the words a chill of fear\nstruck me. It was true, I could prove nothing, having no witnesses, and\nhenceforward I should be a Cain among the Boers, one who had slain a man\nfor jealousy. His gun was empty; yes, but it might be said that I had\nfired it after his death. And as for the graze upon my cheek--why, a\ntwig might have caused it. What should I do, then? Drive him before\nme to the camp, and tell this tale? Even then it would be but my word\nagainst his. No, he had me in a forked stick. I must let him go, and\ntrust that Heaven would avenge his crime, since I could not. Moreover,\nby now my first rage was cooling, and to execute a man thus--\n\n\"Hernan Pereira,\" I said, \"you are a liar and a coward. You tried to\nbutcher me because Marie loves me and hates you, and you want to force\nher to marry you. Yet I cannot shoot you down in cold blood as you\ndeserve. I leave it to God to punish you, as, soon or late, He will,\nhere or hereafter; you who thought to slaughter me and trust to the\nhyenas to hide your crime, as they would have done before morning. Get\nyou gone before I change my mind, and be swift.\"\n\nWithout another word he turned and ran swiftly as a buck, leaping from\nside to side as he ran, to disturb my aim in case I should shoot.\n\nWhen he was a hundred yards away or more I, too, turned and ran, never\nfeeling safe till I knew there was a mile of ground between us.\n\n\nIt was past ten o'clock that night when I got back to the camp, where I\nfound Hans the Hottentot about to start to look for me, with two of the\nZulus, and told him that I had been detained by accidents to the wagon.\nThe Vrouw Prinsloo was still up also, waiting to hear of my arrival.\n\n\"What was the accident, Allan?\" she asked. \"It looks as though there had\nbeen a bullet in it,\" and she pointed to the bloody smear upon my cheek.\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"Pereira's?\" she asked again.\n\nI nodded a second time.\n\n\"Did you kill him?\"\n\n\"No; I let him go. It would have been said that I murdered him,\" and I\ntold her what had happened.\n\n\"Ja, Allan,\" she remarked when I had finished. \"I think you were wise,\nfor you could have proved nothing. But oh! for what fate, I wonder, is\nGod Almighty saving up that stinkcat. Well, I will go and tell Marie\nthat you are back safe, for her father won't let her out of the hut so\nlate; but nothing more unless you wish it.\"\n\n\"No, Tante; I think nothing more, at any rate at present.\"\n\nHere I may state, however, that within a few days Marie and everyone\nelse in the camp knew the story in detail, except perhaps Marais, to\nwhom no one spoke of his nephew. Evidently Vrouw Prinsloo had found\nherself unable to keep secret such an example of the villainy of her\naversion, Pereira. So she told her daughter, who told the others quickly\nenough, though I gathered that some of them set down what had happened\nto accident. Bad as they knew Pereira to be, they could not believe that\nhe was guilty of so black a crime.\n\nAbout a week later the rest of us started from Marais's camp, a place\nthat, notwithstanding the sadness of many of its associations, I confess\nI left with some regret. The trek before us, although not so very long,\nwas of an extremely perilous nature. We had to pass through about two\nhundred miles of country of which all we knew was that its inhabitants\nwere the Amatonga and other savage tribes. Here I should explain that\nafter much discussion we had abandoned the idea of retracing the route\nfollowed by Marais on his ill-fated journey towards Delagoa.\n\nHad we taken this it would have involved our crossing the terrible\nLobombo Mountains, over which it was doubtful whether our light cattle\ncould drag the wagons. Moreover, the country beyond the mountains was\nsaid to be very bare of game and also of Kaffirs, so that food might be\nlacking. On the other hand, if we kept to the east of the mountains the\nveld through which we must pass was thickly populated, which meant that\nin all probability we could buy grain.\n\nWhat finally decided us to adopt this route, however, was that here in\nthese warm, low-lying lands there would be grass for the oxen. Indeed,\nnow, at the beginning of spring, in this part of Africa it was already\npushing. Even if it were not, the beasts could live upon what herbage\nremained over from last summer and on the leaves of trees, neither of\nwhich in this winter veld ever become quite lifeless, whereas on the\nsere and fire-swept plains beyond the mountains they might find nothing\nat all. So we determined to risk the savages and the lions which\nfollowed the game into these hot districts, especially as it was not yet\nthe fever season or that of the heavy rains, so that the rivers would be\nfordable.\n\nI do not propose to set out our adventures in detail, for these would be\ntoo long. Until the great one of which I shall have to tell presently,\nthey were of an annoying rather than of a serious nature. Travelling as\nwe did, between the mountains and the sea, we could not well lose our\nway, especially as my Zulus had passed through that country; and when\ntheir knowledge failed us, we generally managed to secure the services\nof local guides. The roads, however, or rather the game tracks and\nKaffir paths which we followed, were terrible, for with the single\nexception of that of Pereira for part of the distance, no wagon had ever\ngone over them before. Indeed, a little later in the year they could not\nhave been travelled at all. Sometimes we stuck in bogs out of which we\nhad to dig the wheels, and sometimes in the rocky bottoms of streams,\nwhile once we were obliged literally to cut our way through a belt of\ndense bush from which it took us eight days to escape.\n\nOur other chief trouble came from the lions, whereof there were great\nnumbers in this veld. The prevalence of these hungry beasts forced us to\nwatch our cattle very closely while they grazed, and at night, wherever\nit was possible, to protect them and ourselves in \"bombast,\" or\nfences of thorns, within which we lit fires to scare away wild beasts.\nNotwithstanding these precautions, we lost several of the oxen, and\nourselves had some narrow escapes.\n\nThus, one night, just as Marie was about to enter the wagon where the\nwomen slept, a great lion, desperate with hunger, sprang over the fence.\nShe leapt away from the beast, and in so doing caught her foot and fell\ndown, whereon the lion came for her. In another few seconds she would\nhave been dead, or carried off living.\n\nBut as it chanced, Vrouw Prinsloo was close at hand. Seizing a flaming\nbough from the fire, that intrepid woman ran at the lion and, as it\nopened its huge mouth to roar or bite, thrust the burning end of the\nbough into its throat. The lion closed its jaws upon it, then finding\nthe mouthful not to its taste, departed even more quickly than it had\ncome, uttering the most dreadful noises, and leaving Marie quite unhurt.\nNeedless to say, after this I really worshipped the Vrouw Prinsloo,\nthough she, good soul, thought nothing of the business, which in those\ndays was but a common incident of travel.\n\nI think it was on the day after this lion episode that we came upon\nPereira's wagon, or rather its remains. Evidently he had tried to trek\nalong a steep, rocky bank which overhung a stream, with the result that\nthe wagon had fallen into the stream-bed, then almost dry, and been\nsmashed beyond repair.\n\nThe Tonga natives of the neighbourhood, who had burned most of the\nwoodwork in order to secure the precious iron bolts and fittings,\ninformed us that the white man and his servants who were with the wagon\nhad gone forward on foot some ten days before, driving their cattle with\nthem. Whether this story were true or not we had no means of finding\nout. It was quite possible that Pereira and his companions had been\nmurdered, though as we found the Tongas very quiet folk if well treated\nand given the usual complimentary presents for wayleaves, this did not\nseem probable. Indeed, a week later our doubts upon this point were\ncleared up thus.\n\nWe had reached a big kraal called Fokoti, on the Umkusi River, which\nappeared to be almost deserted. We asked an old woman whom we met where\nits people had gone. She answered that they had fled towards the borders\nof Swaziland, fearing an attack from the Zulus, whose territories began\nbeyond this Umkusi River. It seemed that a few days before a Zulu impi\nor regiment had appeared upon the banks of the river, and although there\nwas no war at the time between the Zulus and the Tongas, the latter had\nthought it wise to put themselves out of reach of those terrible spears.\n\nOn hearing this news we debated whether it would not be well for us to\nfollow their example and, trekking westwards, try to find a pass in the\nmountains. Upon this point there was a division of opinion among us.\nMarais, who was a fatalist, wished to go on, saying that the good Lord\nwould protect us, as He had done in the past.\n\n\"Allemachte!\" answered the Vrouw Prinsloo. \"Did He protect all those who\nlie dead at Marais's camp, whither your folly led us, mynheer? The good\nLord expects us to look after our own skins, and I know that these Zulus\nare of the same blood as Umsilikazi's Kaffirs, who have killed so many\nof our people. Let us try the mountains, say I.\"\n\nOf course her husband and son agreed with her, for to them the vrouw's\nword was law; but Marais, being, as usual, obstinate, would not give\nway. All that afternoon they wrangled, while I held my tongue, declaring\nthat I was willing to abide by the decision of the majority. In the end,\nas I foresaw they would, they appealed to me to act as umpire between\nthem.\n\n\"Friends,\" I answered, \"if you had asked me my opinion before, I should\nhave voted for trying the mountains, beyond which, perhaps, we might\nfind some Boers. I do not like this story of the Zulu impi. I think\nthat someone has told them of our coming, and that it is us they mean to\nattack and not the Tongas, with whom they are at peace. My men say that\nit is not usual for impis to visit this part of the country.\"\n\n\"Who could have told them?\" asked Marais.\n\n\"I don't know, mynheer. Perhaps the natives have sent on word, or\nperhaps--Hernan Pereira.\"\n\n\"I knew that you would suspect my nephew, Allan,\" he exclaimed angrily.\n\n\"I suspect no one; I only weigh what is probable. However, it is too\nlate for us to move to-night either south or westwards, so I think I\nwill sleep over the business and see what I can find out from my Zulus.\"\n\nThat night, or rather the following morning, the question was settled\nfor us, for when I woke up at dawn, it was to see the faint light\nglimmering on what I knew must be spears. We were surrounded by a great\ncompany of Zulus, as I discovered afterwards, over two hundred strong.\nThinking that after their fashion they were preparing to attack us at\ndawn, I called the news to the others, whereon Marais rushed forward,\njust as he had left his bed, cocking his roer as he came.\n\n\"For the love of God, do not shoot!\" I said. \"How can we resist so many?\nSoft words are our only chance.\"\n\nStill he attempted to fire, and would have done so had I not thrown\nmyself upon him and literally torn the gun from his hand. By this time\nthe Vrouw Prinsloo had come up, a very weird spectacle, I recollect, in\nwhat she called her \"sleep-garments,\" that included a night-cap made of\na worn jackal skin and a kind of otter-pelt stomacher.\n\n\"Accursed fool!\" she said to Marais, \"would you cause all our throats to\nbe cut? Go forward, you, Allan, and talk to those 'swartzels'\" (that\nis, black creatures), \"gently, as you would to a savage dog. You have a\ntongue steeped in oil, and they may listen to you.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered; \"that seems the best thing to do. If I should not\nreturn, give my love to Marie.\"\n\nSo I beckoned to the headman of my Zulus whom I had hired at Delagoa, to\naccompany me, and marched forward boldly quite unarmed. We were encamped\nupon a rise of ground a quarter of a mile from the river, and the impi,\nor those of them whom we could see, were at the foot of this rise about\na hundred and sixty yards away. The light was growing now, and when I\nwas within fifty paces of them they saw me. At some word of command a\nnumber of men rushed toward me, their fighting shields held over their\nbodies and their spears up.\n\n\"We are dead!\" exclaimed my Kaffir in a resigned voice. I shared his\nopinion, but thought I might as well die standing as running away.\n\nNow I should explain that though as yet I had never mixed with these\nZulus, I could talk several native dialects kindred to that which they\nused very well indeed. Moreover, ever since I had hired men of their\nrace at Delagoa, I had spent all my spare time in conversing with them\nand acquiring a knowledge of their language, history and customs. So by\nthis time I knew their tongue fairly, although occasionally I may have\nused terms which were unfamiliar to them.\n\nThus it came about that I was able to shout to them, asking what was\ntheir business with us. Hearing themselves addressed in words which they\nunderstood, the men halted, and seeing that I was unarmed, three of them\napproached me.\n\n\"We come to take you prisoners, white people, or to kill you if you\nresist,\" said their captain.\n\n\"By whose order?\" I asked.\n\n\"By the order of Dingaan our king.\"\n\n\"Is it so? And who told Dingaan that we were here?\"\n\n\"The Boer who came in front of you.\"\n\n\"Is it so?\" I said again. \"And now what do you need of us?\"\n\n\"That you should accompany us to the kraal of Dingaan.\"\n\n\"I understand. We are quite willing, since it lies upon our road. But\nthen why do you come against us, who are peaceful travellers, with your\nspears lifted?\"\n\n\"For this reason. The Boer told us that there is among you a 'child of\nGeorge'\" (an Englishman), \"a terrible man who would kill us unless we\nkilled or bound him first. Show us this child of George that we may make\nhim fast, or slay him, and we will not hurt the rest of you.\"\n\n\"I am the child of George,\" I answered, \"and if you think it necessary\nto make me fast, do so.\"\n\nNow the Zulus burst out laughing.\n\n\"You! Why, you are but a boy who weighs no more than a fat girl,\"\nexclaimed their captain, a great, bony fellow who was named Kambula.\n\n\"That may be so,\" I answered; \"but sometimes the wisdom of their fathers\ndwells in the young. I am the son of George who saved these Boers from\ndeath far away, and I am taking them back to their own people. We desire\nto see Dingaan, your king. Be pleased therefore to lead us to him as he\nhas commanded you to do. If you do not believe what I tell you, ask this\nman who is with me, and his companions who are of your own race. They\nwill tell you everything.\"\n\nThen the captain Kambula called my servant apart and talked with him for\na long while.\n\nWhen the interview was finished he advanced to me and said:\n\n\"Now I have heard all about you. I have heard that although young you\nare very clever, so clever that you do not sleep, but watch by night\nas well as by day. Therefore, that I, Kambula, name you Macumazahn,\nWatcher-by-night, and by that name you shall henceforth be known among\nus. Now, Macumazahn, son of George, bring out these Boers whom you are\nguiding that I may lead them in their moving huts to the Great Place,\nUmgungundhlovu, where dwells Dingaan the king. See, we lay down our\nspears and will come to meet them unarmed, trusting to you to protect\nus, O Macumazahn, Son of George,\" and he cast his assegai to the ground.\n\n\"Come,\" I said, and led them to the wagons.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. DINGAAN'S BET\n\n\nAs I advanced to the wagons accompanied by Kambula and his two\ncompanions, I saw that Marais, in a state of great excitement, was\nengaged in haranguing the two Prinsloo men and Meyer, while the Vrouw\nPrinsloo and Marie appeared to be attempting to calm him.\n\n\"They are unarmed,\" I heard him shout. \"Let us seize the black devils\nand hold them as hostages.\"\n\nThereon, led by Marais, the three Boer men came towards us doubtfully,\ntheir guns in their hands.\n\n\"Be careful what you are doing,\" I called to them. \"These are envoys,\"\nand they hung back a little while Marais went on with his haranguing.\n\nThe Zulus looked at them and at me, then Kambula said:\n\n\"Are you leading us into a trap, Son of George?\"\n\n\"Not so,\" I answered; \"but the Boers are afraid of you and think to take\nyou prisoners.\"\n\n\"Tell them,\" said Kambula quietly, \"that if they kill us or lay a hand\non us, as no doubt they can do, very soon every one of them will be dead\nand their women with them.\"\n\nI repeated this ultimatum energetically enough, but Marais shouted:\n\n\"The Englishman is betraying us to the Zulus! Do not trust him; seize\nthem as I tell you.\"\n\nWhat would have happened I am sure I do not know; but just then the\nVrouw Prinsloo came up and caught her husband by the arm, exclaiming:\n\n\"You shall have no part in this fool's business. If Marais wishes to\nseize the Zulus, let him do so himself. Are you mad or drunk that you\nshould think that Allan would wish to betray Marie to the Kaffirs, to\nsay nothing of the rest of us?\" and she began to wave an extremely dirty\n\"vatdoek\", or dishcloth, which she always carried about with her and\nused for every purpose, towards Kambula as a sign of peace.\n\nNow the Boers gave way, and Marais, seeing himself in a minority,\nglowered at me in silence.\n\n\"Ask these white people, O Macumazahn,\" said Kambula, \"who is their\ncaptain, for to the captain I would speak.\"\n\nI translated the question, and Marais answered:\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"No,\" broke in Vrouw Prinsloo, \"_I_ am. Tell them, Allan, that these men\nare all fools and have given the rule to me, a woman.\"\n\nSo I told them. Evidently this information surprised them a little, for\nthey discussed together. Then Kambula said:\n\n\"So be it. We have heard that the people of George are now ruled by a\nwoman, and as you, Macumazahn, are one of that people, doubtless it is\nthe same among your party.\"\n\nHere I may add that thenceforward the Zulus always accepted the Vrouw\nPrinsloo as the \"Inkosikaas\" or chieftainess of our little band, and\nwith the single exception of myself, whom they looked upon as her\n\"mouth,\" or induna, would only transact business with or give directions\nto her. The other Boers they ignored completely.\n\nThis point of etiquette settled, Kambula bade me repeat what he had\nalready told me, that we were prisoners whom he was instructed by\nDingaan to convey to his Great Place, and that if we made no attempt to\nescape we should not be hurt upon the journey.\n\nI did so, whereon the vrouw asked as I had done, who had informed\nDingaan that we were coming.\n\nI repeated to her word for word what the Zulus had told me, that it\nwas Pereira, whose object seems to have been to bring about my death or\ncapture.\n\nThen the vrouw exploded.\n\n\"Do you hear that, Henri Marais?\" she screamed. \"It is your stinkcat of\na nephew again. Oh! I thought I smelt him! Your nephew has betrayed us\nto these Zulus that he may bring Allan to his death. Ask them, Allan,\nwhat this Dingaan has done with the stinkcat.\"\n\nSo I asked, and was informed they believed that the king had let Pereira\ngo on to his own people in payment of the information that he had given\nhim.\n\n\"My God!\" said the vrouw, \"I hoped that he had knocked him on the head.\nWell, what is to be done now?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" I answered. Then an idea occurred to me, and I said to\nKambula:\n\n\"It seems to be me, the son of George, that your king wants. Take me,\nand let these people go on their road.\"\n\nThe three Zulus began to discuss this point, withdrawing themselves\na little way so that I could not overhear them. But when the Boers\nunderstood the offer that I had made, Marie, who until now had been\nsilent, grew more angry than ever I had seen her before.\n\n\"It shall not be!\" she said, stamping her foot. \"Father, I have been\nobedient to you for long, but if you consent to this I will be obedient\nno more. Allan saved my cousin Hernan's life, as he saved all our\nlives. In payment for that good deed Hernan tried to murder him in the\nkloof--oh! be quiet, Allan; I know all the story. Now he has betrayed\nhim to the Zulus, telling them that he is a terrible and dangerous man\nwho must be killed. Well, if he is to be killed, I will be killed with\nhim, and if the Zulus take him and let us free, I go with him. Now make\nup your mind.\"\n\nMarais tugged at his beard, staring first at his daughter and then\nat me. What he would have answered I do not know, for at that moment\nKambula stepped forward and gave his decision.\n\nIt was to the effect that although it was the Son of George whom Dingaan\nwanted, his orders were that all with him were to be taken also. Those\norders could not be disobeyed. The king would settle the matter as to\nwhether some of us were to be killed and some let free, or if all\nwere to be killed or let free, when we reached his House. Therefore he\ncommanded that \"we should tie the oxen to the moving huts and cross the\nriver at once.\"\n\nThis was the end of that scene. Having no choice we inspanned and\ncontinued our journey, escorted by the company of two hundred savages.\nI am bound to say that during the four or five days that it took us to\nreach Dingaan's kraal they behaved very well to us. With Kambula and\nhis officers, all of them good fellows in their way, I had many\nconversations, and from them learned much as to the state and customs\nof the Zulus. Also the peoples of the districts through which we passed\nflocked round us at every outspan, for most of them had never seen a\nwhite man before, and in return for a few beads brought us all the food\nthat we required. Indeed, the beads, or their equivalents, were nothing\nbut a present, since, by the king's command, they must satisfy our\nwants. This they did very thoroughly. For instance, when on the last\nday's trek, some of our oxen gave out, numbers of Zulus were inspanned\nin place of them, and by their help the wagons were dragged to the great\nkraal, Umgungundhlovu.\n\nHere an outspan place was assigned to us near to the house, or rather\nthe huts, of a certain missionary of the name of Owen, who with great\ncourage had ventured into this country. We were received with the utmost\nkindness by him and his wife and household, and it is impossible for me\nto say what pleasure I found, after all my journeyings, in meeting an\neducated man of my own race.\n\nNear to our camp was a stone-covered koppie, where, on the morning after\nour arrival, I saw six or eight men executed in a way that I will\nnot describe. Their crime, according to Mr. Owen, was that they had\nbewitched some of the king's oxen.\n\nWhile I was recovering from this dreadful spectacle, which, fortunately,\nMarie did not witness, the captain Kambula arrived, saying that Dingaan\nwished to see me. So taking with me the Hottentot Hans and two of the\nZulus whom I had hired at Delagoa Bay--for the royal orders were that\nnone of the other white people were to come, I was led through the fence\nof the vast town in which stood two thousand huts--the \"multitude of\nhouses\" as the Zulus called it--and across a vast open space in the\nmiddle.\n\nOn the farther side of this space, where, before long, I was fated to\nwitness a very tragic scene, I entered a kind of labyrinth. This was\ncalled \"siklohlo\", and had high fences with numerous turns, so that it\nwas impossible to see where one was going or to find the way in or out.\nUltimately, however, I reached a great hut named \"intunkulu\", a word\nthat means the \"house of houses,\" or the abode of the king, in front\nof which I saw a fat man seated on a stool, naked except for the moocha\nabout his middle and necklaces and armlets of blue beads. Two warriors\nheld their broad shields over his head to protect him from the sun.\nOtherwise he was alone, although I felt sure that the numerous passages\naround him were filled with guards, for I could hear them moving.\n\nOn entering this place Kambula and his companions flung themselves upon\ntheir faces and began to sing praises of which the king took no notice.\nPresently he looked up, and appearing to observe me for the first time\nasked:\n\n\"Who is that white boy?\"\n\nThen Kambula rose and said:\n\n\"O king, this is the Son of George, whom you commanded me to capture. I\nhave taken him and the Amaboona\" (that is, the Boers), \"his companions,\nand brought them all to you, O king.\"\n\n\"I remember,\" said Dingaan. \"The big Boer who was here, and whom\nTambusa\"--he was one of Dingaan's captains--\"let go against my will,\nsaid that he was a terrible man who should be killed before he worked\ngreat harm to my people. Why did you not kill him, Kambula, although it\nis true he does not look very terrible?\"\n\n\"Because the king's word was that I should bring him to the king\nliving,\" answered Kambula. Then he added cheerfully: \"Still, if the king\nwishes it, I can kill him at once.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Dingaan doubtfully; \"perhaps he can mend guns.\"\nNext, after reflecting a while, he bade a shield-holder to fetch\nsomeone, I could not hear whom.\n\n\"Doubtless,\" thought I to myself, \"it is the executioner,\" and at that\nthought a kind of mad rage seized me. Why should my life be ended thus\nin youth to satisfy the whim of a savage? And if it must be so, why\nshould I go alone?\n\nIn the inside pocket of my ragged coat I had a small loaded pistol with\ntwo barrels. One of those barrels would kill Dingaan--at five paces I\ncould not miss that bulk--and the other would blow out my brains, for\nI was not minded to have my neck twisted or to be beaten to death with\nsticks. Well, if it was to be done, I had better do it at once. Already\nmy hand was creeping towards the pocket when a new idea, or rather two\nideas, struck me.\n\nThe first was that if I shot Dingaan the Zulus would probably massacre\nMarie and the others--Marie, whose sweet face I should never see again.\nThe second was that while there is life there is hope. Perhaps, after\nall, he had not sent for an executioner, but for someone else. I would\nwait. A few minutes more of existence were worth the having.\n\nThe shield-bearer returned, emerging from one of the narrow, reed-hedged\npassages, and after him came no executioner, but a young white man,\nwho, as I knew from the look of him, was English. He saluted the king by\ntaking off his hat, which I remember was stuck round with black ostrich\nfeathers, then stared at me.\n\n\"O Tho-maas\" (that is how he pronounced \"Thomas\"), said Dingaan, \"tell\nme if this boy is one of your brothers, or is he a Boer?\"\n\n\"The king wants to know if you are Dutch or British,\" said the white\nlad, speaking in English.\n\n\"As British as you are,\" I answered. \"I was born in England, and come\nfrom the Cape.\"\n\n\"That may be lucky for you,\" he said, \"because the old witch-doctor,\nZikali, has told him that he must not kill any English. What is your\nname? Mine is Thomas Halstead. I am interpreter here.\"\n\n\"Allan Quatermain. Tell Zikali, whoever he may be, that if he sticks to\nhis advice I will give him a good present.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" asked Dingaan suspiciously.\n\n\"He says he is English, no Boer, O king; that he was born across the\nBlack Water, and that he comes from the country out of which all the\nBoers have trekked.\"\n\nAt this intelligence Dingaan pricked up his ears.\n\n\"Then he can tell me about these Boers,\" he said, \"and what they are\nafter, or could if he were able to speak my tongue. I do not trust you\nto interpret, you Tho-maas, whom I know to be a liar,\" and he glowered\nat Halstead.\n\n\"I can speak your tongue, though not very well, O king,\" I interrupted,\n\"and I can tell you all about the Boers, for I have lived among them.\"\n\n\"Ow!\" said Dingaan, intensely interested. \"But perhaps you are also\na liar. Or are you a praying man, like that fool yonder, who is named\nOweena?\"--he meant the missionary Mr. Owen--\"whom I spare because it\nis not lucky to kill one who is mad, although he tries to frighten my\nsoldiers with tales of a fire into which they will go after they are\ndead. As though it matters what happens to them after they are dead!\" he\nadded reflectively, taking a pinch of snuff.\n\n\"I am no liar,\" I answered. \"What have I to lie about?\"\n\n\"You would lie to save your own life, for all white men are cowards; not\nlike the Zulus, who love to die for their king. But how are you named?\"\n\n\"Your people call me Macumazahn.\"\n\n\"Well, Macumazahn, if you are no liar, tell me, is it true that these\nBoers rebelled against their king who was named George, and fled from\nhim as the traitor Umsilikazi did from me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered, \"that is true.\"\n\n\"Now I am sure that you are a liar,\" said Dingaan triumphantly. \"You say\nthat you are English and therefore serve your king, or the Inkosikaas\"\n(that is the Great Lady), \"who they tell me now sits in his place. How\ndoes it come about then that you are travelling with a party of these\nvery Amaboona who must be your enemies, since they are the enemies of\nyour king, or of her who follows after him?\"\n\nNow I knew that I was in a tight place, for on this matter of loyalty,\nZulu, and indeed all native ideas, are very primitive. If I said that I\nhad sympathy with the Boers, Dingaan would set me down as a traitor. If\nI said that I hated the Boers, then still I should be a traitor because\nI associated with them, and a traitor in his eyes would be one to be\nkilled. I do not like to talk religion, and anyone who has read what I\nhave written in various works will admit that I have done so rarely, if\never. Yet at that moment I put up a prayer for guidance, feeling that\nmy young life hung upon the answer, and it came to me--whence I do not\nknow. The essence of that guidance was that I should tell the simple\ntruth to this fat savage. So I said to him:\n\n\"The answer is this, O king. Among those Boers is a maiden whom I love\nand who betrothed herself to me since we were 'so high.' Her father took\nher north. But she sent a message to me saying that her people died\nof fever and she starved. So I went up in a ship to save her, and have\nsaved her, and those who remained alive of her people with her.\"\n\n\"Ow!\" said Dingaan; \"I understand that reason. It is a good reason.\nHowever many wives he may have, there is no folly that a man will not\ncommit for the sake of some particular girl who is not yet his wife.\nI have done as much myself, especially for one who was called Nada the\nLily, of whom a certain Umslopogaas robbed me, one of my own blood of\nwhom I am much afraid.\"*\n\n     [*--See the Author's book named \"Nada the Lily.\"]\n\nFor a while he brooded heavily, then went on:\n\n\"Your reason is good, Macumazahn, and I accept it. More, I promise you\nthis. Perhaps I shall kill these Boers, or perhaps I shall not kill\nthem. But if I make up my mind to kill them, this girl of yours shall be\nspared. Point her out to Kambula here--not to Tho-maas, for he is a liar\nand would tell me the wrong one--and she shall be spared.\"\n\n\"I thank you, O king,\" I said; \"but what is the use of that if I am to\nbe killed?\"\n\n\"I did not say that you were to be killed, Macumazahn, though perhaps I\nshall kill you, or perhaps I shall not kill you. It depends upon whether\nI find you to be a liar, or not a liar. Now the Boer whom Tambusa let\ngo against my wish said that you are a mighty magician as well as a very\ndangerous man, one who can shoot birds flying on the wing with a bullet,\nwhich is impossible. Can you do so?\"\n\n\"Sometimes,\" I answered.\n\n\"Very good, Macumazahn. Now we will see if you are a wizard or a liar.\nI will make a bet with you. Yonder by your camp is a hill called 'Hloma\nAmabutu,' a hill of stones where evildoers are slain. This afternoon\nsome wicked ones die there, and when they are dead the vultures will\ncome to devour them. Now this is my bet with you. When those vultures\ncome you shall shoot at them, and if you kill three out of the first\nfive on the wing--not on the ground, Macumazahn--then I will spare these\nBoers. But if you miss them, then I shall know that you are a liar and\nno wizard, and I will kill them every one on the hill Hloma Amabutu. I\nwill spare none of them except the girl, whom perhaps I will take as a\nwife. As to you, I will not yet say what I will do with you.\"\n\nNow my first impulse was to refuse this monstrous wager, which meant\nthat the lives of a number of people were to be set against my skill in\nshooting. But young Thomas Halstead, guessing the words that were about\nto break from me, said in English:\n\n\"Accept unless you are a fool. If you don't he will cut the throats\nof every one of them and stick your girl into the emposeni\" (that is\nharem), \"while you will become a prisoner as I am.\"\n\nThese were words that I could not resent or neglect, so although despair\nwas in my heart, I said coolly:\n\n\"Be it so, O king. I take your wager. If I kill three vultures out of\nfive as they hover over the hill, then I have your promise that all\nthose who travel with me shall be allowed to go hence in safety.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, Macumazahn; but if you fail to kill them, remember that the\nnext vultures you shoot at shall be those that come to feed upon their\nflesh, for then I shall know that you are no magician, but a common\nliar. And now begone, Tho-maas. I will not have you spying on me; and\nyou, Macumazahn, come hither. Although you talk my tongue so badly, I\nwould speak with you about the Boers.\"\n\nSo Halstead went, shrugging his shoulders and muttering as he passed me:\n\n\"I hope you really _can_ shoot.\"\n\nAfter he had left I sat alone for a full hour with Dingaan while he\ncross-examined me about the Dutch, their movements and their aims in\ntravelling to the confines of his country.\n\nI answered his questions as best I could, trying to make out a good case\nfor them.\n\nAt length, when he grew weary of talking, he clapped his hands, whereon\na number of fine girls appeared, two of whom carried pots of beer, from\nwhich he offered me drink.\n\nI replied that I would have none, since beer made the hand shake and\nthat on the steadiness of my hand that afternoon depended the lives\nof many. To do him justice he quite understood the point. Indeed, he\nordered me to be conducted back to the camp at once that I might rest,\nand even sent one of his own attendants with me to hold a shield over my\nhead as I walked so that I should be protected from the sun.\n\n\"Hamba gachl\u00e9\" (that is \"Go softly\"), said the wicked old tyrant to me\nas I departed under the guidance of Kambula. \"This afternoon, one hour\nbefore sundown, I will meet you at Hloma Amabutu, and there shall be\nsettled the fate of these Amaboona, your companions.\"\n\n\nWhen I reached the camp it was to find all the Boers clustered together\nwaiting for me, and with them the Reverend Mr. Owen and his people,\nincluding a Welsh servant of his, a woman of middle age who, I remember,\nwas called Jane.\n\n\"Well,\" said the Vrouw Prinsloo, \"and what is your news, young man?\"\n\n\"My news, aunt,\" I answered, \"is that one hour before sundown to-day I\nhave to shoot vultures on the wing against the lives of all of you. This\nyou owe to that false-hearted hound Hernan Pereira, who told Dingaan\nthat I am a magician. Now Dingaan would prove it. He thinks that only\nby magic can a man shoot soaring vultures with a bullet, and as he is\ndetermined to kill you all, except perhaps Marie, in the form of a bet\nhe has set me a task which he believes to be impossible. If I fail, the\nbet is lost, and so are your lives. If I succeed I think your lives will\nbe spared, since Kambula there tells me that the king always makes it a\npoint of honour to pay his bets. Now you have the truth, and I hope you\nlike it,\" and I laughed bitterly.\n\nWhen I had finished a perfect storm of execration broke from the Boers.\nIf curses could have killed Pereira, surely he would have died upon the\nspot, wherever he might be. Only two of them were silent, Marie, who\nturned very pale, poor girl, and her father. Presently one of them,\nI think it was Meyer, rounded on him viciously and asked him what he\nthought now of that devil, his nephew.\n\n\"I think there must be some mistake,\" answered Marais quietly, \"since\nHernan cannot have wished that we should all be put to death.\"\n\n\"No,\" shouted Meyer; \"but he wished that Allan Quatermain should, which\nis just as bad; and now it has come about that once more our lives\ndepend upon this English boy.\"\n\n\"At any rate,\" replied Marais, looking at me oddly, \"it seems that he is\nnot to be killed, whether he shoots the vultures or misses them.\"\n\n\"That remains to be proved, mynheer,\" I answered hotly, for the\ninsinuation stung me. \"But please understand that if all of you, my\ncompanions, are to be slaughtered, and Marie is to be put among this\nblack brute's women, as he threatens, I have no wish to live on.\"\n\n\"My God! does he threaten that?\" said Marais. \"Surely you must have\nmisunderstood him, Allan.\"\n\n\"Do you think that I should lie to you on such a matter--\" I began.\n\nBut, before I could proceed, the Vrouw Prinsloo thrust herself between\nus, crying:\n\n\"Be silent, you, Marais, and you too, Allan. Is this a time that you\nshould quarrel and upset yourself, Allan, so that when the trial comes\nyou will shoot your worst and not your best? And is this a time, Henri\nMarais, that you should throw insults at one on whom all our lives hang,\ninstead of praying for God's vengeance upon your accursed nephew? Come,\nAllan, and take food. I have fried the liver of that heifer which the\nking sent us; it is ready and very good. After you have eaten it you\nmust lie down and sleep a while.\"\n\nNow among the household of the Reverend Mr. Owen was an English boy\ncalled William Wood, who was not more than twelve or fourteen years of\nage. This lad knew both Dutch and Zulu, and acted as interpreter to the\nOwen family during the absence on a journey of a certain Mr. Hulley, who\nreally filled that office. While this conversation was taking place in\nDutch he was engaged in rendering every word of it into English for the\nbenefit of the clergyman and his family. When Mr. Owen understood the\nfull terror of the situation, he broke in saying:\n\n\"This is not a time to eat or to sleep, but a time to pray that the\nheart of the savage Dingaan may be turned. Come, let us pray!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" rejoined Vrouw Prinsloo, when William Wood had translated. \"Do\nyou pray, pr\u00e9dicant, and all the rest of you who have nothing else\nto do, and while you are about it pray also that the bullets of Allan\nQuatermain may not be turned. As for me and Allan, we have other things\nto see to, so you must pray a little harder to cover us as well as\nyourselves. Now you come along, nephew Allan, or that liver may be\noverdone and give you indigestion, which is worse for shooting than even\nbad temper. No, not another word. If you try to speak any more, Henri\nMarais, I will box your ears,\" and she lifted a hand like a leg of\nmutton, then, as Marais retreated before her, seized me by the collar as\nthough I were a naughty boy and led me away to the wagons.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. THE REHEARSAL\n\n\nBy the women's wagon we found the liver cooked in its frying-pan, as\nthe vrouw had said. Indeed, it was just done to a turn. Selecting a\nparticularly massive slice, she proceeded to take it from the pan with\nher fingers in order to set it upon a piece of tin, from which she\nhad first removed the more evident traces of the morning meal with her\nconstant companion, the ancient and unwashen vatdoek. As it chanced the\neffort was not very successful, since the boiling liver fat burnt the\nvrouw's fingers, causing her to drop it on the grass, and, I am sorry to\nadd, to swear as well. Not to be defeated, however, having first sucked\nher fingers to ease their smart, she seized the sizzling liver with the\nvatdoek and deposited it upon the dirty tin.\n\n\"There, nephew,\" she said triumphantly, \"there are more ways of killing\na cat than by drowning. What a fool I was not to think of the vatdoek\nat first. Allemachte! how the flesh has burnt me; I don't suppose that\nbeing killed would hurt much more. Also, if the worst comes to the\nworst, it will soon be over. Think of it, Allan, by to-night I may be\nan angel, dressed in a long white nightgown like those my mother gave me\nwhen I was married, which I cut up for baby-clothes because I found\nthem chilly wear, having always been accustomed to sleep in my vest\nand petticoat. Yes, and I shall have wings, too, like those on a white\ngander, only bigger if they are to carry _my_ weight.\"\n\n\"And a crown of Glory,\" I suggested.\n\n\"Yes, of course, a crown of Glory--very large, since I shall be a\nmartyr; but I hope one will only have to wear it on Sundays, as I never\ncould bear anything heavy on my hair; moreover, it would remind me of a\nKaffir's head-ring done in gold, and I shall have had enough of Kaffirs.\nThen there will be the harp,\" she went on as her imagination took fire\nat the prospect of these celestial delights. \"Have you ever seen a harp,\nAllan? I haven't except that which King David carries in the picture in\nthe Book, which looks like a broken rimpi chair frame set up edgeways.\nAs for playing the thing, they will have to teach me, that's all, which\nwill be a difficult business, seeing that I would sooner listen to cats\non the roof than to music, and as for making it--\"\n\nSo she chattered on, as I believe with the object of diverting and\namusing me, for she was a shrewd old soul who knew how important it was\nthat I should be kept in an equable frame of mind at this crisis in our\nfates.\n\nMeanwhile I was doing my best with the lump of liver, that tasted\npainfully of vatdoek and was gritty with sand. Indeed, when the vrouw's\nback was turned I managed to throw the most of it to Hans behind me, who\nswallowed it at a gulp as a dog does, since he did not wish to be caught\nchewing it.\n\n\"God in heaven! how fast you eat, nephew,\" said the vrouw, catching\nsight of my empty tin. Then, eyeing the voracious Hottentot\nsuspiciously, she added: \"That yellow dog of yours hasn't stolen it, has\nhe? If so, I'll teach him.\"\n\n\"No, no, vrouw,\" answered Hans in alarm. \"No meat has passed my lips\nthis day, except what I licked out of the pan after breakfast.\"\n\n\"Then, Allan, you will certainly have indigestion, which is just what I\nwanted to avoid. Have I not often told you that you should chew your bit\ntwenty times before you swallow, which I would do myself if I had any\nback teeth left? Here, drink this milk; it is only a little sour and\nwill settle your stomach,\" and she produced a black bottle and subjected\nit to the attentions of the vatdoek, growing quite angry when I declined\nit and sent for water.\n\nNext she insisted upon my getting into her own bed in the wagon to\nsleep, forbidding me to smoke, which she said made the hand shake.\nThither, then, I went, after a brief conversation with Hans, whom I\ndirected to clean my rifle thoroughly. For I wished to be alone and\nknew that I had little chance of solitude outside of that somewhat fusty\ncouch.\n\nTo tell the truth, although I shut my eyes to deceive the vrouw, who\nlooked in occasionally to see how I was getting on, no sleep came to\nme that afternoon--at least, not for a long while. How could I sleep in\nthat hot place when my heart was torn with doubt and terror? Think of\nit, reader, think of it! An hour or two, and on my skill would hang the\nlives of eight white people--men, women, and children, and the safety\nor the utter shame of the woman whom I loved and who loved me. No, she\nshould be spared the worst. I would give her my pistol, and if there\nwere need she would know what to do.\n\nThe fearful responsibility was more than I could bear. I fell into a\nveritable agony; I trembled and even wept a little. Then I thought of my\nfather and what he would do in such circumstances, and began to pray as\nI had never prayed before.\n\nI implored the Power above me to give me strength and wisdom; not to let\nme fail in this hour of trouble, and thereby bring these poor people to\na bloody death. I prayed till the perspiration streamed down my face;\nthen suddenly I fell into sleep or swoon. I don't know how long I lay\nthus, but I think it must have been the best part of an hour. At last\nI woke up all in an instant, and as I woke I distinctly heard a tiny\nvoice, unlike any other voice in the whole world, speak inside my head,\nor so it seemed to me, saying:\n\n_\"Go to the hill Hloma Amabutu, and watch how the vultures fly. Do what\ncomes into your mind, and even if you seem to fail, fear nothing.\"_\n\nI sat up on the old vrouw's bed, and felt that some mysterious change\nhad come over me. I was no longer the same man. My doubts and terrors\nhad gone; my hand was like a rock; my heart was light. I knew that I\nshould kill those three vultures. Of course the story seems absurd, and\neasy to be explained by the state of my nerves under the strain which\nwas being put upon them, and for aught I know that may be its true\nmeaning. Yet I am not ashamed to confess that I have always held, and\nstill hold, otherwise. I believe that in my extremity some kindly Power\ndid speak to me in answer to my earnest prayers and to those of others,\ngiving me guidance and, what I needed still more, judgment and calmness.\nAt any rate, that this was my conviction at the moment may be seen from\nthe fact that I hastened to obey the teachings of that tiny, unnatural\nvoice.\n\nClimbing out of the wagon, I went to Hans, who was seated near by in the\nfull glare of the hot sun, at which he seemed to stare with unblinking\neyes.\n\n\"Where's the rifle, Hans?\" I said.\n\n\"Intombi is here, baas, where I have put her to keep her cool, so that\nshe may not go off before it is wanted,\" and he pointed to a little\ngrave-like heap of gathered grass at his side.\n\nThe natives, I should explain, named this particular gun \"Intombi\",\nwhich means a young girl, because it was so much slimmer and more\ngraceful than other guns.\n\n\"Is it clean?\" I asked.\n\n\"Never was she cleaner since she was born out of the fire, baas. Also,\nthe powder has been sifted and set to dry in the sun with the caps,\nand the bullets have been trued to the barrel, so that there may be\nno accidents when it comes to the shooting. If you miss the aasvogels,\nbaas, it will not be the fault of Intombi or of the powder and the\nbullets; it will be your own fault.\"\n\n\"That's comforting,\" I answered. \"Well, come on, I want to go to the\nDeath-hill yonder.\"\n\n\"Why, baas, before the time?\" asked the Hottentot, shrinking back a\nlittle. \"It is no place to visit till one is obliged. These Zulus say\nthat ghosts sit there even in the daylight, haunting the rocks where\nthey were made ghosts.\"\n\n\"Vultures sit or fly there also, Hans; and I would see how they fly,\nthat I may know when and where to shoot at them.\"\n\n\"That is right, baas,\" said the clever Hottentot. \"This is not like\nfiring at geese in the Groote Kloof. The geese go straight, like an\nassegai to its mark. But the aasvogels wheel round and round, always on\nthe turn; it is easy to miss a bird that is turning, baas.\"\n\n\"Very easy. Come on.\"\n\nJust as we were starting Vrouw Prinsloo appeared from behind the other\nwagon, and with her Marie, who, I noticed, was very pale and whose\nbeautiful eyes were red, as though with weeping.\n\nThe vrouw asked me where we were going. I told her. After considering a\nlittle, she said that was a good thought of mine, as it was always well\nto study the ground before a battle.\n\nI nodded, and led Marie aside behind some thorn trees that grew near.\n\n\"Oh! Allan, what will be the end of this?\" she asked piteously. High as\nwas her courage it seemed to fail her now.\n\n\"A good end, dearest,\" I answered. \"We shall come out of this hole\nsafely, as we have of many others.\"\n\n\"How do you know that, Allan, which is known to God alone?\"\n\n\"Because God told me, Marie,\" and I repeated to her the story of the\nvoice I had heard in my dream, which seemed to comfort her.\n\n\"Yet, yet,\" she exclaimed doubtfully, \"it was but a dream, Allan, and\ndreams are such uncertain things. You may fail, after all.\"\n\n\"Do I look like one who will fail, Marie?\"\n\nShe studied me from head to foot, then answered:\n\n\"No, you do not, although you did when you came back from the king's\nhuts. Now you are quite changed. Still, Allan, you may fail, and\nthen--what? Some of those dreadful Zulus have been here while you were\nsleeping, bidding us all make ready to go to the Hill of Death. They\nsay that Dingaan is in earnest. If you do not kill the vultures, he will\nkill us. It seems that they are sacred birds, and if they escape he will\nthink he has nothing to fear from the white men and their magic, and so\nwill make a beginning by butchering us. I mean the rest of us, for I am\nto be kept alive, and oh! what shall I do, Allan?\"\n\nI looked at her, and she looked at me. Then I took the double-barrelled\npistol out of my pocket and gave it to her.\n\n\"It is loaded and on the half-cock,\" I said.\n\nShe nodded, and hid it in her dress beneath her apron. Then without more\nwords we kissed and parted, for both of us feared to prolong that scene.\n\n\nThe hill Hloma Amabutu was quite close to our encampment and the huts of\nthe Reverend Mr. Owen, scarcely a quarter of a mile off, I should say,\nrising from the flat veld on the further side of a little depression\nthat hardly amounted to a valley. As we approached it I noticed its\npeculiar and blasted appearance, for whereas all around the grass was\nvivid with the green of spring, on this place none seemed to grow. An\neminence strewn with tumbled heaps of blackish rock, and among them a\nfew struggling, dark-leaved bushes; that was its appearance. Moreover,\nmany of these boulders looked as though they had been splashed and lined\nwith whitewash, showing that they were the resting-place of hundreds of\ngorged vultures.\n\nI believe it is the Chinese who declare that particular localities have\ngood or evil influences attached to them, some kind of spirit of their\nown, and really Hloma Amabutu and a few other spots that I am acquainted\nwith in Africa give colour to the fancy. Certainly as I set foot upon\nthat accursed ground, that Golgotha, that Place of Skulls, a shiver went\nthrough me. It may have been caused by the atmosphere, moral and actual,\nof the mount, or it may have been a prescience of a certain dreadful\nscene which within a few months I was doomed to witness there. Or\nperhaps the place itself and the knowledge of the trial before me sent\na sudden chill through my healthy blood. I cannot say which it was, but\nthe fact remains as I have stated, although a minute or two later, when\nI saw what kind of sleepers lay upon that mount, it would not have been\nnecessary for me to seek any far-fetched explanation of my fear.\n\nAcross this hill, winding in and out between the rough rocks that lay\nhere, there and everywhere like hailstones after a winter storm, ran\nsundry paths. It seems that the shortest road to various places in the\nneighbourhood of the Great Kraal ran over it, and although no Zulu ever\ndared to set foot there between sun-set and rise, in the daytime they\nused these paths freely enough. But I suppose that they also held\nthat this evil-omened field of death had some spirit of its own, some\ninvisible but imminent fiend, who needed to be propitiated, lest soon he\nshould claim them also.\n\nThis was their method of propitiation, a common one enough, I believe,\nin many lands, though what may be its meaning I cannot tell. As the\ntraveller came to those spots where the paths cut across each other, he\ntook a stone and threw it on to a heap that had been accumulated there\nby the hands of other travellers. There were many such heaps upon the\nhill, over a dozen, I think, and the size of them was great. I should\nsay that the biggest contained quite fifty loads of stones, and the\nsmallest not fewer than twenty or thirty.\n\nNow, Hans, although he had never set foot there before, seemed to have\nlearned all the traditions of the place, and what rites were necessary\nto avert its curse. At any rate, when we came to the first heap, he cast\na stone upon it, and begged me to do the same. I laughed and refused,\nbut when we reached the second heap the same thing happened. Again I\nrefused, whereon, before we came to a third and larger pile, Hans sat\ndown upon the ground and began to groan, swearing that he would not go\none step farther unless I promised to make the accustomed offering.\n\n\"Why not, you fool?\" I asked.\n\n\"Because if you neglect it, baas, I think that we shall stop here for\never. Oh! you may laugh, but I tell you that already you have brought\nill-luck upon yourself. Remember my words, baas, when you miss two of\nthe five aasvogels.\"\n\n\"Bosh!\" I exclaimed, or, rather, its Dutch equivalent. Still, as this\ntalk of missing vultures touched me nearly, and it is always as well\nto conform to native prejudices, at the next and two subsequent heaps I\ncast my stone as humbly as the most superstitious Zulu in the land.\n\nBy this time we had reached the summit, which may have been two hundred\nyards long. It was hog-backed in shape, with a kind of depression in the\nmiddle cleared of stones, either by the hand of man or nature, and not\nunlike a large circus in its general conformation.\n\nOh! the sight that met my eyes. All about lay the picked and scattered\nbones of men and women, many of them broken up by the jaws of hyenas.\nSome were quite fresh, for the hair still clung to the skulls, others\nblanched and old. But new or ancient there must have been hundreds of\nthem. Moreover, on the sides of the hill it was the same story, though\nthere, for the most part, the bones had been gathered into gleaming\nheaps. No wonder that the vultures loved Hloma Amabutu, the Place of\nSlaughter of the bloody Zulu king.\n\nOf these horrible birds, however, at the moment not one was to be seen.\nAs there had been no execution for a few hours they were seeking their\nfood elsewhere. Now, for my own purposes, I wanted to see them, since\notherwise my visit was in vain, and presently bethought myself of a\nmethod of securing their arrival.\n\n\"Hans,\" I said, \"I am going to pretend to kill you, and then you must\nlie quite still out there like one dead. Even if the aasvogels settle\non you, you must lie quite still, so that I may see whence they come and\nhow they settle.\"\n\nThe Hottentot did not take at all kindly to this suggestion. Indeed, he\nflatly refused to obey me, giving sundry good reasons. He said that\nthis kind of rehearsal was ill-omened; that coming events have a way of\ncasting their shadow before, and he did not wish to furnish the event.\nHe said that the Zulus declared that the sacred aasvogels of Hloma\nAmabutu were as savage as lions, and that when once they saw a man down\nthey would tear him to pieces, dead or living. In short, Hans and I came\nto an acute difference of opinion. As for every reason it was necessary\nthat my view should prevail, however, I did not hesitate to put matters\nto him very plainly.\n\n\"Hans,\" I said, \"you have to be a bait for vultures; choose if you will\nbe a live bait or a dead bait,\" and I cocked the rifle significantly,\nalthough, in truth, the last thing that I wished or intended to do was\nto shoot my faithful old Hottentot friend. But Hans, knowing all I had\nat stake, came to a different conclusion.\n\n\"Allemachte! baas,\" he said, \"I understand, and I do not blame you.\nWell, if I obey alive, perhaps my guardian Snake\" (or spirit) \"will\nprotect me from the evil omen, and perhaps the aasvogels will not pick\nout my eyes. But if once you send a bullet through my stomach--why, then\neverything is finished, and for Hans it is 'Good night, sleep well.' I\nwill obey you, baas, and lie where you wish, only, I pray you, do not\nforget me and go away, leaving me with those devil birds.\"\n\nI promised him faithfully that I would not. Then we went through a very\ngrim little pantomime. Proceeding to the centre of the arena-like space,\nI lifted the gun, and appeared to dash out Hans' brains with its butt.\nHe fell upon his back, kicked about a little, and lay still. This\nfinished Act 1.\n\nAct 2 was that, capering like a brute of a Zulu executioner, I retired\nfrom my victim and hid myself in a bush on the edge of the plateau at\na distance of forty yards. After this there was a pause. The place was\nintensely bright with sunshine and intensely silent; as silent as the\nskeletons of the murdered men about me; as silent as Hans, who lay there\nlooking so very small and dead in that big theatre where no grass grew.\nIt was an eerie wait in such surroundings, but at length the curtain\nrang up for Act 3.\n\nIn the infinite arch of blue above me I perceived a speck, no larger\nthan a mote of dust. The aasvogel on watch up there far out of the range\nof man's vision had seen the deed, and, by sinking downwards, signalled\nit to his companions that were quartering the sky for fifty miles round;\nfor these birds prey by sight, not by smell. Down he came and down,\nand long before he had reached the neighbourhood of earth other specks\nappeared in the distant blue. Now he was not more than four or five\nhundred yards above me, and began to wheel, floating round the place\nupon his wide wings, and sinking as he wheeled. So he sank softly and\nslowly until he was about a hundred and fifty feet above Hans. Then\nsuddenly he paused, hung quite steady for a few seconds, shut his wings\nand fell like a bolt, only opening them again just before he reached the\nearth.\n\nHere he settled, tilting forward in that odd way which vultures have,\nand scrambling a few awkward paces until he gained his balance. Then\nhe froze into immobility, gazing with in awful, stony glare at the\nprostrate Hans, who lay within about fifteen feet of him. Scarcely was\nthis aasvogel down, when others, summoned from the depths of sky, did as\nhe had done. They appeared, they sank, they wheeled, always from east to\nwest, the way the sun travels. They hovered for a few seconds, then fell\nlike stones, pitched on to their beaks, recovered themselves, waddled\nforward into line, and sat gazing at Hans. Soon there was a great ring\nof them about him, all immovable, all gazing, all waiting for something.\n\nPresently that something appeared in the shape of an aasvogel which was\nnearly twice as big as any of the others. This was what the Boers and\nthe natives call the \"king vulture,\" one of which goes with every flock.\nHe it is who rules the roost and also the carcase, which without his\npresence and permission none dare to attack. Whether this vile fowl is\nof a different species from the others, or whether he is a bird of more\nvigorous growth and constitution that has outgrown the rest and thus\nbecome their overlord, is more than I can tell. At least it is certain,\nas I can testify from long and constant observation, that almost every\nflock of vultures has its king.\n\nWhen this particular royalty had arrived, the other aasvogels, of which\nperhaps there were now fifty or sixty gathered round Hans, began to show\nsigns of interested animation. They looked at the king bird, they\nlooked at Hans, stretching out their naked red necks and winking their\nbrilliant eyes. I, however, did not pay particular attention to those\nupon the earth, being amply occupied in watching their fellows in the\nair.\n\nWith delight I observed that the vulture is a very conservative\ncreature. They all did what doubtless they have done since the days of\nAdam or earlier--wheeled, and then hung that little space of time before\nthey dropped to the ground like lead. This, then, would be the moment\nat which to shoot them, when for four or five seconds they offered\npractically a sitting target. Now, at that distance, always under a\nhundred yards, I knew well that I could hit a tea plate every shot,\nand a vulture is much larger than a tea plate. So it seemed to me that,\nbarring accidents, I had little to fear from the terrible trial of skill\nwhich lay before me. Again and again I covered the hovering birds\nwith my rifle, feeling that if I had pressed the trigger I should have\npierced them through.\n\nThinking it well to practise, I continued this game for a long while,\ntill at last it came to an unexpected end. Suddenly I heard a scuffling\nsound. Dropping my glance I saw that the whole mob of aasvogels were\nrushing in upon Hans, helping themselves forward by flapping their great\nwings, and that about three feet in front of them was their king. Next\ninstant Hans vanished, and from the centre of that fluffy, stinking mass\nthere arose a frightful yell.\n\nAs a matter of fact, as I found afterwards, the king vulture had\nfastened on to his snub nose, whilst its dreadful companions, having\nseized other portions of his frame, were beginning to hang back after\ntheir fashion in order to secure some chosen morsel. Hans kicked and\nscreamed, and I rushed in shouting, causing them to rise in a great,\nflapping cloud that presently vanished this way and that. Within a\nminute they had all gone, and the Hottentot and I were left alone.\n\n\"That is good,\" I said. \"You played well.\"\n\n\"Good! baas,\" he answered, \"and I with two cuts in my nose in which I\ncan lay my finger, and bites all over me. Look how my trousers are torn.\nLook at my head--where is the hair? Look at my nose. Good! Played well!\nIt is those verdomde aasvogels that played. Oh! baas, if you had seen\nand smelt them, you would not say that it was good. See, one more second\nand I, who have two nostrils, should have had four.\"\n\n\"Never mind, Hans,\" I said, \"it is only a scratch, and I will make you a\npresent of some new trousers. Also, here is tobacco for you. Come to the\nbush; let us talk.\"\n\nSo we went, and when Hans was a little composed I told him all that I\nhad observed about the habits of the aasvogel in the air, and he told me\nall that he had observed about their habits on the ground, which, as I\nmight not shoot them sitting, did not interest me. Still, he agreed with\nme that the right moment to fire would be just before they pounced.\n\nWhilst we were still talking we heard a sound of shouts, and, looking\nover the brow of the hill that faced towards Umgungundhlovu, we saw\na melancholy sight. Being driven up the slope towards us by three\nexecutioners and a guard of seven or eight soldiers, their hands tied\nbehind their backs, were three men, one very old, one of about fifty\nyears of age, and one a lad, who did not look more than eighteen. As I\nsoon heard, they were of a single family, the grandfather, the father,\nand the eldest son, who had been seized upon some ridiculous charge of\nwitchcraft, but really in order that the king might take their cattle.\n\nHaving been tried and condemned by the Nyangas, or witch-doctors, these\npoor wretches were now doomed to die. Indeed, not content with thus\ndestroying the heads of the tribe, present and to come, for three\ngenerations, all their descendants and collaterals had already been\nwiped out by Dingaan, so that he might pose as sole heir to the family\ncattle.\n\nSuch were the dreadful cruelties that happened in Zululand in those\ndays.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. THE PLAY\n\n\nThe doomed three were driven by their murderers into the centre of the\ndepression, within a few yards of which Hans and I were standing.\n\nAfter them came the head executioner, a great brute who wore a curiously\nshaped leopard-skin cap--I suppose as a badge of office--and held in\nhis hand a heavy kerry, the shaft of which was scored with many notches,\neach of them representing a human life.\n\n\"See, White Man,\" he shouted, \"here is the bait which the king sends to\ndraw the holy birds to you. Had it not been that you needed such bait,\nperhaps these wizards would have escaped. But the Black One said the\nlittle Son of George, who is named Macumazahn, needs them that he may\nshow his magic, and therefore they must die to-day.\"\n\nNow, at this information I turned positively sick. Nor did it make me\nfeel better when the youngest of the victims, hearing the executioner's\nwords, flung himself upon his knees, and began to implore me to spare\nhim. His grandfather also addressed me, saying:\n\n\"Chief, will it not be enough if I die? I am old, and my life does not\nmatter. Or if one is not sufficient, take me and my son, and let the\nlad, my grandson, go free. We are all of us innocent of any witchcraft,\nand he is not even old enough to practise such things, being but an\nunmarried boy. Chief, you, also, are young. Would not your heart be\nheavy if you had to be slain when the sun of your life was still new in\nthe sky? Think, White Chief, what your father would feel, if you have\none, should he be forced to see you killed before his eyes, that some\nstranger might use your body to show his skill with a magic weapon by\nslaying the wild things that would eat it.\"\n\nNow, almost with tears, I broke in, explaining to the venerable man as\nwell as I could that their horrible fate had nothing to do with me. I\ntold him that I was innocent of their blood, who was forced to be\nthere to try to shoot vultures on the wing in order to save my white\ncompanions from a doom similar to their own. He listened attentively,\nasking a question now and again, and when he had mastered my meaning,\nsaid with a most dignified calmness:\n\n\"Now I understand, White Man, and am glad to learn that you are not\ncruel, as I thought. My children,\" he added, turning to the others, \"let\nus trouble this Inkoos no more. He only does what he must do to save the\nlives of his brethren by his skill, if he can. If we continue to plead\nwith him and stir his heart to pity, the sorrow swelling in it may cause\nhis hand to shake, and then they will die also, and their blood be on\nhis head and ours. My children, it is the king's will that we should\nbe slain. Let us make ready to obey the king, as men of our House have\nalways done. White lord, we thank you for your good words. May you live\nlong, and may good fortune sleep in your hut to the end. May you shoot\nstraight, also, with your magic tool, and thereby win the lives of your\ncompany out of the hand of the king. Farewell, Inkoos,\" and since he\ncould not lift his bound hands in salutation, he bowed to me, as did the\nothers.\n\nThen they walked to a little distance, and, seating themselves on the\nground, began to talk together, and after a while to drone some strange\nchant in unison. The executioners and the guards also sat down not far\naway, laughing, chatting, and passing a horn of snuff from hand to hand.\nIndeed, I observed that the captain of them even took some snuff to the\nvictims, and held it in his palm beneath their noses while they drew it\nup their nostrils and politely thanked him between the sneezes.\n\nAs for myself, I lit a pipe and smoked it, for I seemed to require a\nstimulant, or, rather, a sedative. Before it was finished Hans, who was\nengaged in doctoring his scratches made by the vultures' beaks with a\nconcoction of leaves which he had been chewing, exclaimed suddenly in\nhis matter-of-fact voice:\n\n\"See, baas, here they come, the white people on one side and the black\non the other, just like the goats and the sheep at Judgment Day in the\nBook.\"\n\nI looked, and there to my right appeared the party of Boers, headed by\nthe Vrouw Prinsloo, who held the remnants of an old umbrella over her\nhead. To the left advanced a number of Zulu nobles and councillors, in\nfront of whom waddled Dingaan arrayed in his bead dancing dress. He was\nsupported by two stalwart body-servants, whilst a third held a shield\nover his head to protect him from the sun, and a fourth carried a large\nstool, upon which he was to sit. Behind each party, also, I perceived\na number of Zulus in their war-dress, all of them armed with broad\nstabbing spears.\n\nThe two parties arrived at the stone upon which I was sitting almost\nsimultaneously, as probably it had been arranged that they should do,\nand halted, staring at each other. As for me, I sat still upon my stone\nand smoked on.\n\n\"Allemachte! Allan,\" puffed the Vrouw Prinsloo, who was breathless with\nher walk up the hill, \"so here you are! As you did not come back, I\nthought you had run away and left us, like that stinkcat Pereira.\"\n\n\"Yes, Tante (aunt), here I am,\" I answered gloomily, \"and I wish to\nheaven that I was somewhere else.\"\n\nJust then Dingaan, having settled his great bulk upon the stool and\nrecovered his breath, called to the lad Halstead, who was with him, and\nsaid:\n\n\"O Tho-maas, ask your brother, Macumazahn, if he is ready to try to\nshoot the vultures. If not, as I wish to be fair, I will give him a\nlittle more time to make his magic medicine.\"\n\nI replied sulkily that I was as ready as I was ever likely to be.\n\nThen the Vrouw Prinsloo, understanding that the king of the Zulus was\nbefore her, advanced upon him, waving her umbrella. Catching hold of\nHalstead, who understood Dutch, she forced him to translate an harangue,\nwhich she addressed to Dingaan.\n\nHad he rendered it exactly as it came from her lips, we should all have\nbeen dead in five minutes, but, luckily, that unfortunate young man had\nlearnt some of the guile of the serpent during his sojourn among the\nZulus, and varied her vigorous phrases. The gist of her discourse was\nthat he, Dingaan, was a black-hearted and bloody-minded villain, with\nwhom the Almighty would come even sooner or later (as, indeed, He did),\nand that if he dared to touch one hair of her or of her companions'\nheads, the Boers, her countrymen, would prove themselves to be the\nministers of the Almighty in that matter (as, indeed, they did). As\ntranslated by Halstead into Zulu, what she said was that Dingaan was the\ngreatest king in the whole world; in fact, that there was not, and never\nhad been, any such a king either in power, wisdom, or personal beauty,\nand that if she and her companions had to die, the sight of his glory\nconsoled them for their deaths.\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Dingaan suspiciously, \"if that is what this man-woman\nsays, her eyes tell one story and her lips another. Oh! Tho-maas, lie no\nmore. Speak the true words of the white chieftainess, lest I should find\nthem out otherwise, and give you to the slayers.\"\n\nThus adjured, Halstead explained that he had not yet told all the words.\nThe \"man-woman,\" who was, as he, Dingaan, supposed, a great chieftainess\namong the Dutch, added that if he, the mighty and glorious king, the\nearth-shaker, the world-eater, killed her or any of her subjects, her\npeople would avenge her by killing him and his people.\n\n\"Does she say that?\" said Dingaan. \"Then, as I thought, these Boers are\ndangerous, and not the peaceful folk they make themselves out to be,\"\nand he brooded for a while, staring at the ground. Presently he lifted\nhis head and went on: \"Well, a bet is a bet, and therefore I will not\nwipe out this handful, as otherwise I would have done at once. Tell the\nold cow of a chieftainess that, notwithstanding her threats, I stick\nto my promise. If the little Son of George, Macumazahn, can shoot three\nvultures out of five by help of his magic, then she and her servants\nshall go free. If not, the vultures which he has missed shall feed\non them, and afterwards I will talk with her people when they come to\navenge her. Now, enough of this indaba. Bring those evildoers here that\nthey may thank and praise me, who give them so merciful an end.\"\n\nSo the grandfather, the father, and the son were hustled before Dingaan\nby the soldiers, and greeted him with the royal salute of \"bay\u00e9te.\"\n\n\"O king,\" said the old man, \"I and my children are innocent. Yet if it\npleases you, O king, I am ready to die, and so is my son. Yet we pray\nyou to spare the little one. He is but a boy, who may grow up to do you\ngood service, as I have done to you and your House for many years.\"\n\n\"Be silent, you white-headed dog!\" answered Dingaan fiercely. \"This lad\nis a wizard, like the rest of you, and would grow up to bewitch me and\nto plot with my enemies. Know that I have stamped out all your family,\nand shall I then leave him to breed another that would hate me?\nBegone to the World of Spirits, and tell them how Dingaan deals with\nsorcerers.\"\n\nThe old man tried to speak again, for evidently he loved this grandchild\nof his, but a soldier struck him in the face, and Dingaan shouted:\n\n\"What! Are you not satisfied? I tell you that if you say more I will\nforce you to kill the boy with your own hand. Take them away.\"\n\nThen I turned and hid my face, as did all the white folk. Presently I\nheard the old man, whom they had saved to the last that he might witness\nthe deaths of his descendants, cry in a loud voice:\n\n\"On the night of the thirtieth full moon from this day I, the\nfar-sighted, I, the prophet, summon thee, Dingaan, to meet me and mine\nin the Land of Ghosts, and there to pay--\"\n\nThen with a roar of horror the executioners fell on him and he died.\nWhen there was silence I looked up, and saw that the king, who had\nturned a dirty yellow hue with fright, for he was very superstitious,\nwas trembling and wiping the sweat from his brow.\n\n\"You should have kept the wizard alive,\" he said in a shaky voice to the\nhead slayer, who was engaged in cutting three more nicks on the handle\nof his dreadful kerry. \"Fool, I would have heard the rest of his lying\nmessage.\"\n\nThe man answered humbly that he thought it best it should remain\nunspoken, and got himself out of sight as soon as possible. Here I may\nremark that by an odd coincidence Dingaan actually was killed about\nthirty moons from that time. Mopo, his general, who slew his brother\nChaka, slew him also with the help of Umslopogaas, the son of Chaka. In\nafter years Umslopogaas told me the story of the dreadful ghost-haunted\ndeath of this tyrant, but, of course, he could not tell me exactly upon\nwhat day it happened. Therefore I do not know whether the prophecy was\nstrictly accurate.*\n\n     [*--For the history of the death of Dingaan, see the\n     Author's \"Nada the Lily.\"]\n\nThe three victims lay dead in the hollow of the Hill of Death. Presently\nthe king, recovering himself, gave orders that the spectators should\nbe moved back to places where they could see what happened without\nfrightening the vultures. So the Boers, attended by their band of\nsoldiers, who were commanded to slay them at once if they attempted to\nescape, went one way, and Dingaan and his Zulus went the other, leaving\nHans and myself alone behind our bush. As the white people passed me,\nVrouw Prinsloo wished me good luck in a cheerful voice, although I could\nsee that her poor old hand was shaking, and she was wiping her eyes with\nthe vatdoek. Henri Marais, also in broken tones, implored me to shoot\nstraight for his daughter's sake. Then came Marie, pale but resolute,\nwho said nothing, but only looked me in the eyes, and touched the pocket\nof her dress, in which I knew the pistol lay hid. Of the rest of them I\ntook no notice.\n\nThe moment, that dreadful moment of trial, had come at last; and oh! the\nsuspense and the waiting were hard to bear. It seemed an age before the\nfirst speck, that I knew to be a vulture, appeared thousands of feet\nabove me and began to descend in wide circles.\n\n\"Oh, baas,\" said poor Hans, \"this is worse than shooting at the geese in\nthe Groote Kloof. Then you could only lose your horse, but now--\"\n\n\"Be silent,\" I hissed, \"and give me the rifle.\"\n\nThe vulture wheeled and sank, sank and wheeled. I glanced towards the\nBoers, and saw that they were all of them on their knees. I glanced\ntowards the Zulus, and saw that they were watching as, I think, they had\nnever watched anything before, for to them this was a new excitement.\nThen I fixed my eyes upon the bird.\n\nIts last circle was accomplished. Before it pounced it hung on wide,\noutstretched wings, as the others had done, its head towards me. I drew\na deep breath, lifted the rifle, got the foresight dead upon its breast,\nand touched the hair-trigger. As the charge exploded I saw the aasvogel\ngive a kind of backward twist. Next instant I heard a loud clap, and a\nsurge of joy went through me, for I thought that the bullet had found\nits billet. But alas! it was not so.\n\nThe clap was that of the air disturbed by the passing of the ball and\nthe striking of this air against the stiff feathers of the wings. Anyone\nwho has shot at great birds on the wing with a bullet will be acquainted\nwith the sound. Instead of falling the vulture recovered itself. Not\nknowing the meaning of this unaccustomed noise, it dropped quietly to\nearth and sat down near the bodies, pitching forward in the natural\nway and running a few paces, as the others had done that afternoon.\nEvidently it was quite unhurt.\n\n\"Missed!\" gasped Hans as he grasped the rifle to load it. \"Oh! why did\nyou not throw a stone on to the first heap?\"\n\nI gave Hans a look that must have frightened him; at any rate, he spoke\nno more. From the Boers went up a low groan. Then they began to pray\nharder than ever, while the Zulus clustered round the king and whispered\nto him. I learned afterwards that he was giving heavy odds against\nme, ten to one in cattle, which they were obliged to take, unwillingly\nenough.\n\nHans finished loading, capped and cocked the rifle, and handed it to me.\nBy now other vultures were appearing. Being desperately anxious to get\nthe thing over one way or another, at the proper moment I took the first\nof them. Again I covered it dead and pressed. Again as the gun exploded\nI saw that backward lurch of the bird, and heard the clap of the air\nupon its wings. Then--oh horror!--this aasvogel turned quietly, and\nbegan to mount the ladder of the sky in the same fashion as it had\ndescended. I had missed once more.\n\n\"The second heap of stones has done this, baas,\" said Hans faintly, and\nthis time I did not even look him. I only sat down and buried my face in\nmy hands. One more such miss, and then--\n\nHans began to whisper to me.\n\n\"Baas,\" he said, \"those aasvogels see the flash of the gun, and shy at\nit like a horse. Baas, you are shooting into their faces, for they all\nhang with their beaks toward you before they drop. You must get behind\nthem, and fire into their tails, for even an aasvogel cannot see with\nits tail.\"\n\nI let fall my hands and stared at him. Surely the poor fellow had been\ninspired from on high! I understood it all now. While their beaks were\ntowards me, I might fire at fifty vultures and never hit one, for each\ntime they would swerve from the flash, causing the bullet to miss them,\nthough but by a little.\n\n\"Come,\" I gasped, and began to walk quickly round the edge of the\ndepression to a rock, which I saw opposite about a hundred yards away.\nMy journey took me near the Zulus, who mocked me as I passed, asking\nwhere my magic was, and if I wished to see the white people killed\npresently. Dingaan was now offering odds of fifty cattle to one against\nme, but no one would take the bet even with the king.\n\nI made no answer; no, not even when they asked me \"if I had thrown down\nmy spear and was running away.\" Grimly, despairingly, I marched on to\nthe rock, and took shelter behind it with Hans. The Boers, I saw, were\nstill upon their knees, but seemed to have ceased praying. The children\nwere weeping; the men stared at each other; Vrouw Prinsloo had her arm\nabout Marie's waist. Waiting there behind the rock, my courage returned\nto me, as it sometimes does in the last extremity. I remembered my dream\nand took comfort. Surely God would not be so cruel as to suffer me to\nfail and thereby bring all those poor people to their deaths.\n\nSnatching the rifle from Hans, I loaded it myself; nothing must be\ntrusted to another. As I put on the cap a vulture made its last circle.\nIt hung in the air just as the others had done, and oh! its tail was\ntowards me. I lifted, I aimed between the gathered-up legs, I pressed\nand shut my eyes, for I did not dare to look.\n\nI heard the bullet strike, or seem to strike, and a few seconds later\nI heard something else--the noise of a heavy thud upon the ground. I\nlooked, and there with outstretched wings lay the foul bird dead, stone\ndead, eight or ten paces from the bodies.\n\n\"Allemachte! that's better,\" said Hans. \"You threw stones on to _all_\nthe other heaps, didn't you, baas?\"\n\nThe Zulus grew excited, and the odds went down a little. The Boers\nstretched out their white faces and stared at me; I saw them out of the\ncorner of my eye as I loaded again. Another vulture came; seeing one\nof its companions on the ground, if in a somewhat unnatural attitude,\nperhaps it thought that there could be nothing to fear. I leaned against\nmy rock, aimed, and fired, almost carelessly, so sure was I of the\nresult. This time I did not shut my eyes, but watched to see what\nhappened.\n\nThe bullet struck the bird between its thighs, raked it from end to end,\nand down it came like a stone almost upon the top of its fellow.\n\n\"Good, good!\" said Hans with a guttural chuckle of delight. \"Now, baas,\nmake no mistake with the third, and 'als sall recht kommen' (all shall\nbe well).\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered; \"_if_ I make no mistake with the third.\"\n\nI loaded the rifle again myself, being very careful to ram down the\npowder well and to select a bullet that fitted perfectly true to the\nbore. Moreover, I cleared the nipple with a thorn, and shook a little\nfine powder into it, so as to obviate any chance of a miss-fire. Then\nI set on the cap and waited. What was going on among the Boers or\nthe Zulus I do not know. In this last crisis of all our fates I never\nlooked, being too intent upon my own part in the drama.\n\nBy now the vultures appeared to have realised that something unusual was\nin progress, which threatened danger to them. At any rate, although by\nthis time they had collected in hundreds from east, west, north, and\nsouth, and were wheeling the heavens above in their vast, majestic\ncircles, none of them seemed to care to descend to prey upon the bodies.\nI watched, and saw that among their number was that great king bird\nwhich had bitten Hans in the face; it was easy to distinguish him,\nbecause he was so much larger than the others. Also, he had some white\nat the tips of his wings. I observed that certain of his company drew\nnear to him in the skies, where they hung together in a knot, as though\nin consultation.\n\nThey separated out again, and the king began to descend, deputed\nprobably to spy out the land. Down he came in ever-narrowing turns,\ntill he reached the appointed spot for the plunge, and, according to the\nimmemorial custom of these birds, hung a while before he pounced with\nhis head to the south and his great, spreading tail towards me.\n\nThis was my chance, and, rejoicing in having so large a mark, I got the\nsight upon him and pulled. The bullet thudded, some feathers floated\nfrom his belly, showing that it had gone home, and I looked to see\nhim fall as the others had done. But alas! he did not fall. For a few\nseconds he rocked to and fro upon his great wings, then commenced to\ntravel upwards in vast circles, which grew gradually more narrow, till\nhe appeared to be flying almost straight into the empyrean. I stared and\nstared. Everybody stared, till that enormous bird became, first a\nmere blot upon the blue, and at length but a speck. Then it vanished\naltogether into regions far beyond the sight of man.\n\n\"Now there is an end,\" I said to Hans.\n\n\"Ja, baas,\" answered the Hottentot between his chattering teeth, \"there\nis an end. You did not put in enough powder. Presently we shall all be\ndead.\"\n\n\"Not quite,\" I said with a bitter laugh. \"Hans, load the rifle, load it\nquick. Before they die there shall be another king in Zululand.\"\n\n\"Good, good!\" he exclaimed as he loaded desperately. \"Let us take that\nfat pig of a Dingaan with us. Shoot him in the stomach, baas; shoot him\nin the stomach, so that he too may learn what it is to die slowly. Then\ncut my throat, here is my big knife, and afterwards cut your own, if\nyou have not time to load the gun again and shoot yourself, which is\neasier.\"\n\nI nodded, for it was in my mind to do these things. Never could I stand\nstill and see those poor Boers killed, and I knew that Marie would look\nafter herself.\n\nMeanwhile, the Zulus were coming towards me, and the soldiers who had\ncharge of them were driving up Marais's people, making pretence to\nthrust them through with their assegais, and shouting at them as men\ndo at cattle. Both parties arrived in the depression at about the same\ntime, but remained separated by a little space. In this space lay the\ncorpses of the murdered men and the two dead aasvogels, with Hans and\nmyself standing opposite to them.\n\n\"Well, little Son of George,\" puffed Dingaan, \"you have lost your bet,\nfor you did but kill two vultures out of five with your magic, which\nwas good as far as it went, but not good enough. Now you must pay, as I\nwould have paid had you won.\"\n\nThen he stretched out his hand, and issued the dreadful order of \"Bulala\namalongu!\" (Kill the white people). \"Kill them one by one, that I may\nsee whether they know how to die, all except Macumazahn and the tall\ngirl, whom I keep.\"\n\nSome of the soldiers made a dash and seized the Vrouw Prinsloo, who was\nstanding in front of the party.\n\n\"Wait a little, King,\" she called out as the assegais were lifted over\nher. \"How do you know that the bet is lost? He whom you call Macumazahn\nhit that last vulture. It should be searched for before you kill us.\"\n\n\"What does the old woman say?\" asked Dingaan, and Halstead translated\nslowly.\n\n\"True,\" said Dingaan. \"Well, now I will send her to search for the\nvulture in the sky. Come back thence, Fat One, and tell us if you find\nit.\"\n\nThe soldiers lifted their assegais, waiting the king's word. I pretended\nto look at the ground, and cocked my rifle, being determined that if he\nspoke it, it should be his last. Hans stared upwards--I suppose to avoid\nthe sight of death--then suddenly uttered a wild yell, which caused\neveryone, even the doomed people, to turn their eyes to him. He was\npointing to the heavens, and they looked to see at what he pointed.\n\nThis was what they saw. Far, far above in that infinite sea of\nblue there appeared a tiny speck, which his sharp sight had already\ndiscerned, a speck that grew larger and larger as it descended with\nterrific and ever-growing speed.\n\n_It was the king vulture falling from the heavens--dead!_\n\nDown it came between the Vrouw Prinsloo and the slayers, smashing the\nlifted assegai of one of them and hurling him to the earth. Down it\ncame, and lay there a mere mass of pulp and feathers.\n\n\"O Dingaan,\" I said in the midst of the intense silence that followed,\n\"it seems that it is I who have won the bet, not you. I killed this king\nof birds, but being a king it chose to die high up and alone, that is\nall.\"\n\nDingaan hesitated, for he did not wish to spare the Boers, and I, noting\nhis hesitation, lifted my rifle a little. Perhaps he saw it, or perhaps\nhis sense of honour, as he understood the word, overcame his wish for\ntheir blood. At any rate, he said to one of his councillors:\n\n\"Search the carcase of that vulture and see if there is a bullet hole in\nit.\"\n\nThe man obeyed, feeling at the mass of broken bones and flesh. By\ngood fortune he found, not the hole, for that was lost in the general\ndestruction of the tissues, but the ball itself, which, having pierced\nthe thick body from below upwards, had remained fast in the tough skin\njust by the back-bone where the long, red neck emerges from between the\nwings. He picked it out, for it was only hanging in the skin, and held\nit up for all to see.\n\n\"Macumazahn has won his bet,\" said Dingaan. \"His magic has conquered,\nthough by but a very little. Macumazahn, take these Boers, they are\nyours, and begone with them out of my country.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. RETIEF ASKS A FAVOUR\n\n\nNow and again during our troubled journey through life we reach little\noases of almost perfect happiness, set jewel-like here and there in\nthe thorny wilderness of time. Sometimes these are hours of mere animal\ncontent. In others they are made beautiful by waters blowing from our\nspiritual springs of being, as in those rare instances when the material\nveil of life seems to be rent by a mighty hand, and we feel the presence\nand the comfort of God within us and about us, guiding our footsteps to\nthe ineffable end, which is Himself. Occasionally, however, all these,\nphysical satisfaction and love divine and human, are blended to a whole,\nlike soul and body, and we can say, \"Now I know what is joy.\"\n\nSuch an hour came to me on the evening of that day of the winning of my\nbet with Dingaan, when a dozen lives or so were set against my nerve and\nskill. These had not failed me, although I knew that had it not been\nfor the inspiration of the Hottentot Hans (who sent it, I wonder?)\nthey would have been of no service at all. With all my thought and\nexperience, it had never occurred to me that the wonderful eyes of the\nvultures would see the flash of the powder even through the pervading\nsunlight, and swerve before the deadly bullet could reach them.\n\nOn that night I was indeed a hero in a small way. Even Henri Marais\nthawed and spoke to me as a father might to his child, he who always\ndisliked me in secret, partly because I was an Englishman, partly\nbecause I was everything to his daughter and he was jealous, and partly\nfor the reason that I stood in the path of his nephew, Hernan Pereira,\nwhom he either loved or feared, or both. As for the rest of them, men,\nwomen and children, they thanked and blessed me with tears in their\neyes, vowing that, young as I was, thenceforth I and no other should be\ntheir leader. As may be imagined, although it is true that she set down\nmy success to her meal of bullock's liver and the nap which she had\ninsisted on my taking, the Vrouw Prinsloo was the most enthusiastic of\nthem all.\n\n\"Look at him,\" she said, pointing with her fat finger at my\ninsignificant self and addressing her family. \"If only I had such a\nhusband or a son, instead of you lumps that God has tied to me like\nclogs to the heels of a she-ass, I should be happy.\"\n\n\"God did that in order to prevent you from kicking, old vrouw,\" said\nher husband, a quiet man with a vein of sardonic humour. \"If only He had\ntied another clog to your tongue, I should be happy also\"; whereon the\nvrouw smacked his head and her children got out of the way sniggering.\n\nBut the most blessed thing of all was my interview with Marie. All that\ntook place between us can best be left to the imagination, since the\ntalk of lovers, even in such circumstances, is not interesting to\nothers. Also, in a sense, it is too sacred to repeat. One sentence I\nwill set down, however, because in the light of after events I feel that\nit was prophetic, and not spoken merely by chance. It was at the end of\nour talk, as she was handing me back the pistol that I had given her for\na certain dreadful purpose.\n\n\"Three times you have saved my life, Allan--once at Maraisfontein, once\nfrom starvation, and now from Dingaan, whose touch would have meant my\ndeath. I wonder whether it will ever be my turn to save yours?\"\n\nShe looked down for a little while, then lifted her head and laid her\nhand upon my shoulder, adding slowly: \"Do you know, Allan, I think that\nit will at the--\" and suddenly she turned and left me with her sentence\nunfinished.\n\n\nSo thus it came about that by the help of Providence I was enabled to\nrescue all these worthy folk from a miserable and a bloody death. And\nyet I have often reflected since that if things had gone differently;\nif, for instance, that king aasvogel had found strength to carry itself\naway to die at a distance instead of soaring straight upwards like\na towering partridge, as birds injured in the lungs will often do--I\nsuppose in search of air--it might have been better in the end. Then\nI should certainly have shot Dingaan dead and every one of us would as\ncertainly have been killed on the spot. But if Dingaan had died that\nday, Retief and his companions would never have been massacred. Also as\nthe peaceful Panda, his brother, would, I suppose, have succeeded to the\nthrone, probably the subsequent slaughter at Weenen, and all the after\nfighting, would never have taken place. But so it was fated, and who\nam I that I should quarrel with or even question the decrees of fate?\nDoubtless these things were doomed to happen, and they happened in due\ncourse. There is nothing more to be said.\n\nEarly on the following morning we collected our oxen, which, although\nstill footsore, were now full fed and somewhat rested. An hour or two\nlater began our trek, word having come to us from Dingaan that we must\nstart at once. Also he sent us guides, under the command of the captain\nKambula, to show us the road to Natal.\n\nI breakfasted that day with the Reverend Mr. Owen and his people, my\nobject being to persuade him to come away with us, as I did not consider\nthat Zululand was a safe place for white women and children. My mission\nproved fruitless. Mrs. Hulley, the wife of the absent interpreter, who\nhad three little ones, Miss Owen and the servant, Jane Williams, were\nall of them anxious enough to do as I suggested. But Mr. and Mrs. Owen,\nwho were filled with the true fervour of missionaries, would not listen.\nThey said that God would protect them; that they had only been a few\nweeks in the country, and that it would be the act of cowards and of\ntraitors to fly at the very beginning of their work. Here I may add that\nafter the massacre of Retief they changed their opinion, small blame to\nthem, and fled as fast as anyone else.\n\nI told Mr. Owen how very close I had gone to shooting Dingaan, in which\nevent they might all have been killed with us. This news shocked him\nmuch. Indeed, he lectured me severely on the sins of bloodthirstiness\nand a desire for revenge. So, finding that we looked at things\ndifferently, and that it was of no use wasting breath in argument, I\nwished him and his people good-bye and good fortune and went upon my\nway, little guessing how we should meet again.\n\nAn hour later we trekked. Passing by the accursed hill, Hloma Amabutu,\nwhere I saw some gorged vultures sleeping on the rocks, we came to the\ngate of the Great Kraal. Here, to my surprise, I saw Dingaan with some\nof his councillors and an armed guard of over a hundred men, seated\nunder the shade of two big milk trees. Fearing treachery, I halted the\nwagons and advised the Boers to load their rifles and be ready for the\nworst. A minute or so later young Thomas Halstead arrived and told me\nthat Dingaan wished to speak with us. I asked him if that meant that we\nwere to be killed. He answered, \"No, you are quite safe.\" The king had\nreceived some news that had put him in a good humour with the white\npeople, and he desired to bid us farewell, that was all.\n\nSo we trekked boldly to where Dingaan was, and, stopping the wagons,\nwent up to him in a body. He greeted us kindly enough, and even gave me\nhis fat hand to shake.\n\n\"Macumazahn,\" he said, \"although it has cost me many oxen, I am glad\nthat your magic prevailed yesterday. Had it not done so I should have\nkilled all these your friends, which would have been a cause of war\nbetween me and the Amaboona. Now, this morning I have learned that these\nAmaboona are sending a friendly embassy to me under one of their great\nchiefs, and I think that you will meet them on the road. I charge you,\ntherefore, to tell them to come on, having no fear, as I will receive\nthem well and listen to all they have to say.\"\n\nI answered that I would do so.\n\n\"Good,\" he replied. \"I am sending twelve head of cattle with you, six\nof them for your food during your journey, and six as a present to the\nembassy of the Amaboona. Also Kambula, my captain, has charge to see you\nsafely over the Tugela River.\"\n\nI thanked him and turned to go, when suddenly his eye fell upon Marie,\nwho, foolishly enough, took this opportunity to advance from among the\nothers and speak to me about something--I forget what.\n\n\"Macumazahn, is that the maiden of whom you spoke to me?\" asked Dingaan;\n\"she whom you are going to marry?\"\n\nI answered, \"Yes.\"\n\n\"By the head of the Black One,\" he exclaimed, \"she is very fair. Will\nyou not make a present of her to me, Macumazahn?\"\n\nI answered, \"No; she is not mine to give away.\"\n\n\"Well, then, Macumazahn, I will pay you a hundred head of cattle for\nher, which is the price of a royal wife, and give you ten of the fairest\ngirls in Zululand in exchange.\"\n\nI answered that it could not be.\n\nNow the king began to grow angry.\n\n\"I will keep her, whether you wish it or no,\" he said.\n\n\"Then you will keep her dead, O Dingaan,\" I replied, \"for there is more\nof that magic which slew the vultures.\"\n\nOf course, I meant that Marie would be dead. But as my knowledge of the\nZulu tongue was imperfect, he understood the words to mean that _he_\nwould be dead, and I think they frightened him. At any rate, he said:\n\n\"Well, I promised you all safe-conduct if you won your bet, so hamba\ngachl\u00e9 (go in peace). I wish to have no quarrel with the white folk,\nbut, Macumazahn, you are the first of them who has refused a gift to\nDingaan. Still, I bear you no grudge, and if you choose to come back\nagain, you will be welcome, for I perceive that, although so small, you\nare very clever and have a will of your own; also that you mean what you\nsay and speak the truth. Tell the People of George that my heart is soft\ntowards them.\" Then he turned and walked away through the gates of the\nkraal.\n\nGlad enough was I to see the last of him, for now I knew that we were\nsafe, except from such accidents as may overtake any travellers through\na wild country. For the present, at any rate until after he had seen\nthis embassy, Dingaan wished to stand well with the Boers. Therefore it\nwas obvious that he would never make an irreparable quarrel with them\nby treacherously putting us to death as we trekked through his country.\nBeing sure of this, we went on our way with light hearts, thanking\nHeaven for the mercies which had been shown to us.\n\nIt was on the third day of our trek, when we were drawing near to the\nTugela, that we met the Boer embassy, off-saddled by a little stream\nwhere we proposed to outspan to rest the oxen while we ate our midday\nmeal. They were sleeping in the heat of the day and saw nothing of us\ntill we were right on to them, when, catching sight of our Zulu advance\nguard, they sprang up and ran for their rifles. Then the wagons emerged\nfrom the bush, and they stared astonished, wondering who could be\ntrekking in that country.\n\nWe called to them in Dutch not to be afraid and in another minute we\nwere among them. While we were yet some way off my eye fell upon a\nburly, white-bearded man whose figure seemed to be familiar to me, and\ntowards him I went, taking no heed of the others, of whom there may\nhave been six or seven. Soon I was sure, and advancing with outstretched\nhand, said:\n\n\"Good-day, Mynheer Piet Retief. Who would have thought that we who\nparted so far away and so long ago would live to meet among the Zulus?\"\n\nHe stared at me.\n\n\"Who is it? Who is it? Allemachte! I know now. The little Englishman,\nAllan Quatermain, who shot the geese down in the Old Colony. Well, I\nshould not be surprised, for the man you beat in that match told me that\nyou were travelling in these parts. Only I understood him to say that\nthe Zulus had killed you.\"\n\n\"If you mean Hernan Pereira,\" I answered, \"where did you meet him?\"\n\n\"Why, down by the Tugela there, in a bad way. However, he can tell you\nall about that himself, for I have brought him with me to show us the\npath to Dingaan's kraal. Where is Pereira? Send Pereira here. I want to\nspeak with him.\"\n\n\"Here I am,\" answered a sleepy voice, the hated voice of Pereira\nhimself, from the other side of a thick bush, where he had been\nslumbering. \"What is it, commandant? I come,\" and he emerged, stretching\nhimself and yawning, just as the remainder of my party came up. He\ncaught sight of Henri Marais first of all, and began to greet him,\nsaying: \"Thank God, my uncle, you are safe!\"\n\nThen his eyes fell on me, and I do not think I ever saw a man's face\nchange more completely. His jaw dropped, the colour left his cheeks,\nleaving them of the yellow which is common to persons of Portuguese\ndescent; his outstretched hand fell to his side.\n\n\"Allan Quatermain!\" he ejaculated. \"Why, I thought that you were dead.\"\n\n\"As I should have been, Mynheer Pereira, twice over if you could have\nhad your way,\" I replied.\n\n\"What do you mean, Allan?\" broke in Retief.\n\n\"I will tell you what he means,\" exclaimed the Vrouw Prinsloo, shaking\nher fat fist at Pereira. \"That yellow dog means that twice he has tried\nto murder Allan--Allan, who saved his life and ours. Once he shot at him\nin a kloof and grazed his cheek; look, there is the scar of it. And once\nhe plotted with the Zulus to slaughter him, telling Dingaan that he was\nan evildoer and a wizard, who would bring a curse upon his land.\"\n\nNow Retief looked at Pereira.\n\n\"What do you say to this?\" he asked.\n\n\"What do I say?\" repeated Pereira, recovering himself. \"Why, that it is\na lie or a misunderstanding. I never shot at Heer Allan in any kloof. Is\nit likely that I should have done so when he had just nursed me back\nto life? I never plotted with the Zulus for his death, which would have\nmeant the deaths of my uncle and my cousin and of all their companions.\nAm I mad that I should do such a thing?\"\n\n\"Not mad, but bad,\" screamed the vrouw. \"I tell you, Heer Retief, it\nis no lie. Ask those with me,\" she added, appealing to the others, who,\nwith the exception of Marais, answered as with one voice:\n\n\"No; it is no lie.\"\n\n\"Silence!\" said the commandant. \"Now, nephew Allan, tell us your story.\"\n\nSo I told him everything, of course leaving out all details. Even then\nthe tale was long, though it did not seem to be one that wearied my\nhearers.\n\n\"Allemachte!\" said Retief when I had finished, \"this is a strange story,\nthe strangest that ever I heard. If it is true, Hernan Pereira, you\ndeserve to have your back set against a tree and to be shot.\"\n\n\"God in heaven!\" he answered, \"am I to be condemned on such a tale--I,\nan innocent man? Where is the evidence? This Englishman tells all this\nagainst me for a simple reason--that he has robbed me of the love of my\ncousin, to whom I was affianced. Where are his witnesses?\"\n\n\"As to the shooting at me in the kloof, I have none except God who saw\nyou,\" I answered. \"As to the plot that you laid against me among the\nZulus, as it chances, however, there is one, Kambula, the captain\nwho was sent to take me as you had arranged, and who now commands our\nescort.\"\n\n\"A savage!\" exclaimed Pereira. \"Is the tale of a savage to be taken\nagainst that of a white man? Also, who will translate his story? You,\nMynheer Quatermain, are the only one here who knows his tongue, if you\ndo know it, and you are my accuser.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" remarked Retief. \"Such a witness should not be admitted\nwithout a sworn interpreter. Now listen; I pass judgment as commandant\nin the field. Hernan Pereira, I have known you to be a rogue in the\npast, for I remember that you cheated this very young man, Allan\nQuatermain, at a friendly trial of skill at which I was present; but\nsince then till now I have heard nothing more of you, good or bad.\nTo-day this Allan Quatermain and a number of my own countrymen bring\ngrave charges against you, which, however, at present are not capable of\nproof or disproof. Well, I cannot decide those charges, whatever my own\nopinion may be. I think that you had better go back with your uncle,\nHenri Marais, to the trek-Boers, where they can be laid before a court\nand settled according to law.\"\n\n\"If so, he will go back alone,\" said the Vrouw Prinsloo. \"He will not\ngo back with us, for we will elect a field-cornet and shoot him--the\nstinkcat, who left us to starve and afterwards tried to kill little\nAllan Quatermain, who saved our lives\"; and the chorus behind her\nechoed:\n\n\"Ja, ja, we will shoot him.\"\n\n\"Hernan Pereira,\" said Retief, rubbing his broad forehead, \"I don't\nquite know why it is, but no one seems to want you as a companion.\nIndeed, to speak truth, I don't myself. Still, I think you would be\nsafer with me than with these others whom you seem to have offended.\nTherefore, I suggest that you come on with us. But listen here, man,\" he\nadded sternly, \"if I find you plotting against us among the Zulus, that\nhour you are dead. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"I understand that I am one slandered,\" replied Pereira. \"Still, it is\nChristian to submit to injuries, and therefore I will do as you wish. As\nto these bearers of false witness, I leave them to God.\"\n\n\"And I leave you to the devil,\" shouted Vrouw Prinsloo, \"who will\ncertainly have you soon or late. Get out of my sight, stinkcat, or I\nwill pull your hair off.\" And she rushed at him, flapping her dreadful\nvatdoek--which she produced from some recess in her raiment--in his\nface, driving him away as though he were a noxious insect.\n\nWell, he went I know not where, and so strong was public opinion against\nhim that I do not think that even his uncle, Henri Marais, sought him\nout to console him.\n\nWhen Pereira was gone, our party and that of Retief fell into talk, and\nwe had much to tell. Especially was the commandant interested in the\nstory of my bet with Dingaan, whereby I saved the lives of all my\ncompanions by shooting the vultures.\n\n\"It was not for nothing, nephew, that God Almighty gave you the power\nof holding a gun so straight,\" said Retief to me when he understood the\nmatter. \"I remember that when you killed those wildfowl in the Groote\nKloof with bullets, which no other man could have done, I wondered why\nyou should have such a gift above all the rest of us, who have practised\nfor so many more years. Well, now I understand. God Almighty is no fool;\nHe knows His business. I wish you were coming back with me to Dingaan;\nbut as that tainted man, Hernan Pereira, is of my company, perhaps it is\nbetter that you should stay away. Tell me, now, about this Dingaan; does\nhe mean to kill us?\"\n\n\"Not this time, I think, uncle,\" I answered; \"because first he wishes to\nlearn all about the Boers. Still, do not trust him too far just because\nhe speaks you softly. Remember, that if I had missed the third vulture,\nwe should all have been dead by now. And, if you are wise, keep an eye\nupon Hernan Pereira.\"\n\n\"These things I will do, nephew, especially the last of them; and now we\nmust be getting on. Stay; come here, Henri Marais; I have a word to say\nto you. I understand that this little Englishman, Allan Quatermain, who\nis worth ten bigger men, loves your daughter, whose life he has saved\nagain and again, and that she loves him. Why, then, do you not let them\nmarry in a decent fashion?\"\n\n\"Because before God I have sworn her to another man--to my nephew,\nHernan Pereira, whom everyone slanders,\" answered Marais sulkily. \"Until\nshe is of age that oath holds.\"\n\n\"Oho!\" said Retief, \"you have sworn your lamb to that hyena, have you?\nWell, look out that he does not crack your bones as well as hers, and\nperhaps some others also. Why does God give some men a worm in their\nbrains, as He does to the wildebeeste, a worm that always makes them run\nthe wrong way? I don't know, I am sure; but you who are very religious,\nHenri Marais, might think the matter over and tell me the answer when\nnext we meet. Well, this girl of yours will soon be of age, and then, as\nI am commandant down yonder where she is going, I'll see she marries the\nman she wants, whatever you say, Henri Marais. Heaven above us! I only\nwish it were my daughter he was in love with. A fellow who can shoot to\nsuch good purpose might have the lot of them\"; and uttering one of his\ngreat, hearty laughs, he walked off to his horse.\n\n\nOn the morrow of this meeting we forded the Tugela and entered the\nterritory that is now called Natal. Two days' short trekking through\na beautiful country brought us to some hills that I think were called\nPakadi, or else a chief named Pakadi lived there, I forget which.\nCrossing these hills, on the further side of them, as Retief had told us\nwe should do, we found a large party of the trek-Boers, who were already\noccupying this land on the hither side of the Bushman's River, little\nknowing, poor people, that it was fated to become the grave of many\nof them. To-day, and for all future time, that district is and will be\nknown by the name of Weenen, or the Place of Weeping, because of those\npioneers who here were massacred by Dingaan within a few weeks of the\ntime of which I write.\n\nNice as the land was, for some reason or other it did not quite suit\nmy fancy, and therefore, in view of my approaching marriage with Marie,\nhaving purchased a horse from one of the trek-Boers, I began to explore\nthe country round. My object was to find a stretch of fertile veld where\nwe could settle when we were wedded, and such a spot I discovered after\nsome trouble. It lay about thirty miles away to the east, in the loop of\na beautiful stream that is now known as the Mooi River.\n\nEnclosed in this loop were some thirty thousand acres of very rich,\nlow-lying soil, almost treeless and clothed with luxuriant grasses where\ngame was extraordinarily numerous. At the head of it rose a flat-topped\nhill, from the crest of which, oddly enough, flowed a plentiful stream\nof water fed by a strong spring. Half-way down this hill, facing to\nthe east, and irrigable by the stream, was a plateau several acres in\nextent, which furnished about the best site for a house that I know in\nall South Africa. Here I determined we would build our dwelling-place\nand become rich by the breeding up of great herds of cattle. I should\nexplain that this ground, which once, as the remains of their old kraals\nshowed, had belonged to a Kaffir tribe killed out by Chaka, the Zulu\nking, was to be had for the taking.\n\nIndeed, as there was more land than we could possibly occupy, I\npersuaded Henri Marais, the Prinsloos and the Meyers, with whom I had\ntrekked from Delagoa, to visit it with me. When they had seen it they\nagreed to make it their home in the future, but meanwhile elected to\nreturn to the other Boers for safety's sake. So with the help of some\nKaffirs, of whom there were a few in the district, remnants of those\ntribes which Chaka had destroyed, I pegged out an estate of about twelve\nthousand acres for myself, and, selecting a site, set the natives to\nwork to build a rough mud house upon it which would serve as a temporary\ndwelling. I should add that the Prinsloos and the Meyers also made\narrangements for the building of similar shelters almost alongside of my\nown. This done, I returned to Marie and the trek-Boers.\n\nOn the morning after my return to the camp Piet Retief appeared there\nwith his five or six companions. I asked him how he had got on with\nDingaan.\n\n\"Well enough, nephew,\" he answered. \"At first the king was somewhat\nangry, saying that we Boers had stolen six hundred head of his cattle.\nBut I showed him that it was the chief, Sikonyela, who lives yonder on\nthe Caledon River, who had dressed up his people in white men's clothes\nand put them upon horses, and afterwards drove the cattle through one of\nour camps to make it appear that we were the thieves. Then he asked me\nwhat was my object in visiting him. I answered that I sought a grant of\nthe land south of the Tugela to the sea.\n\n\"'Bring me back the cattle that you say Sikonyela has stolen,' he said,\n'and we will talk about this land.' To this I agreed and soon after left\nthe kraal.\"\n\n\"What did you do with Hernan Pereira, uncle?\" I asked.\n\n\"This, Allan. When I was at Umgungundhlovu I sought out the truth of\nthat story you told me as to his having made a plot to get you killed by\nthe Zulus on the ground that you were a wizard.\"\n\n\"And what did you discover, uncle?\"\n\n\"I discovered that it was true, for Dingaan told me so himself. Then I\nsent for Pereira and ordered him out of my camp, telling him that if\nhe came back among the Boers I would have him put on his trial for\nattempted murder. He said nothing, but went away.\"\n\n\"Whither did he go?\"\n\n\"To a place that Dingaan gave him just outside his kraal. The king said\nthat he would be useful to him, as he could mend guns and teach his\nsoldiers to shoot with them. So there, I suppose, he remains, unless he\nhas thought it wiser to make off. At any rate, I am sure that he will\nnot come here to trouble you or anyone.\"\n\n\"No, uncle, but he may trouble you _there_,\" I said doubtfully.\n\n\"What do you mean, Allan?\"\n\n\"I don't quite know, but he is black-hearted, a traitor by nature, and\nin one way or the other he will stir up sorrow. Do you think that\nhe will love you, for instance, after you have hunted him out like a\nthief?\"\n\nRetief shrugged his shoulders and laughed as he answered:\n\n\"I will take my chance of that. What is the use of troubling one's head\nabout such a snake of a man? And now, Allan, I have something to ask\nyou. Are you married yet?\"\n\n\"No, uncle, nor can be for another five weeks, when Marie comes of age.\nHer father still holds that his oath binds him, and I have promised that\nI will not take her till then.\"\n\n\"Does he indeed, Allan? I think that Henri Marais is 'kransick' (that\nis, cracked), or else his cursed nephew, Hernan, has fascinated him, as\na snake does a bird. Still, I suppose that he has the law on his side,\nand, as I am commandant, I cannot advise anyone to break the law. Now\nlisten. It is no use your staying here looking at the ripe peach you\nmay not pluck, for that only makes the stomach sick. Therefore the\nbest thing that you can do is to come with me to get those cattle from\nSikonyela, for I shall be very glad of your company. Afterwards, too,\nI want you to return with me to Zululand when I go for the grant of all\nthis country.\"\n\n\"But how about my getting married?\" I asked in dismay.\n\n\"Oh! I dare say you will be able to marry before we start. Or if not, it\nmust be when we return. Listen now; do not disappoint me in this matter,\nAllan. None of us can speak Zulu except you, who takes to these savage\nlanguages like a duck to water, and I want you to be my interpreter with\nDingaan. Also the king specially asked that you should come with me when\nI brought the cattle, as he seems to have taken a great fancy to you. He\nsaid that you would render his words honestly, but that he did not trust\nthe lad whom he has there to translate into Dutch and English. So you\nsee it will help me very much in this big business if you come with me.\"\n\nStill I hesitated, for some fear of the future lay heavy on my heart,\nwarning me against this expedition.\n\n\"Allemachte!\" said Retief angrily, \"if you will not grant me a favour,\nlet it be. Or is it that you want reward? If so, all I can promise you\nis twenty thousand acres of the best land in the country when we get\nit.\"\n\n\"No, Mynheer Retief,\" I replied; \"it is no question of reward; and as\nfor the land, I have already pegged out my farm on a river about thirty\nmiles to the east. It is that I do not like to leave Marie alone,\nfearing lest her father should play some trick on me as regards her and\nHernan Pereira.\"\n\n\"Oh, if that is all you are afraid of, Allan, I can soon settle matters;\nfor I will give orders to the pr\u00e9dicant Celliers that he is not to marry\nMarie Marais to anyone except yourself, even if she asks him. Also I\nwill order that if Hernan Pereira should come to the camp, he is to be\nshut up until I return to try him. Lastly, as commandant, I will name\nHenri Marais as one of those who are to accompany us, so that he will be\nable to plot nothing against you. Now are you satisfied?\"\n\nI said \"Yes\" as cheerfully as I could, though I felt anything but\ncheerful, and we parted, for, of course, the Commandant Retief had much\nto occupy him.\n\nThen I went and told Marie what I had promised. Somewhat to my surprise\nshe said that she thought I had acted wisely.\n\n\"If you stayed here,\" she added, \"perhaps some new quarrel would arise\nbetween you and my father which might make bitterness afterwards. Also,\ndear, it would be foolish for you to offend the Commandant Retief, who\nwill be the great man in this country, and who is very fond of you.\nAfter all, Allan, we shall only be separated for a little while, and\nwhen that is done we have the rest of our lives to spend together. As\nfor me, do not be afraid, for you know I will never marry anyone but\nyou--no, not to save myself from death.\"\n\nSo I left her somewhat comforted, knowing how sound was her judgment,\nand went off to make my preparations for the expedition to Sikonyela's\ncountry.\n\nAll this conversation with Retief I have set down in full, as nearly as\nI can remember it, because of its fateful consequences. Ah! if I could\nhave foreseen; if only I could have foreseen!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. THE COUNCIL\n\n\nTwo days later we started to recover Dingaan's cattle, sixty or seventy\nof us, all well armed and mounted. With us went two of Dingaan's\ncaptains and a number of Zulus, perhaps a hundred, who were to drive the\ncattle if we recovered them. As I could speak their language I was more\nor less in command of this Zulu contingent, and managed to make myself\nvery useful in that capacity. Also, during the month or so of our\nabsence, by continually conversing with them, I perfected myself\nconsiderably in my knowledge of their beautiful but difficult tongue.\n\nNow it is not my intention to write down the details of this expedition,\nduring which there was no fighting and nothing serious happened. We\narrived in due course at Sikonyela's and stated our errand. When he\nsaw how numerous and well armed we were, and that behind us was all\nthe might of the Zulu army, that wily old rascal thought it well to\nsurrender the stolen cattle without further to-do, and with these some\nhorses which he had lifted from the Boers. So, having received them,\nwe delivered them over to the Zulu captains, with instructions to drive\nthem carefully to Umgungundhlovu. The commandant sent a message by these\nmen to the effect that, having fulfilled his part of the compact, he\nwould wait upon Dingaan as soon as possible in order to conclude the\ntreaty about the land.\n\nThis business finished, Retief took me and a number of the Boers\nto visit other bodies of the emigrant Dutch who were beyond the\nDrakensberg, in what is now the Transvaal territory. This occupied a\nlong time, as these Boers were widely scattered, and at each camp we\nhad to stop for several days while Retief explained everything to its\nleaders. Also he arranged with them to come down into Natal, so as to\nbe ready to people it as soon as he received the formal cession of\nthe country from Dingaan. Indeed, most of them began to trek at once,\nalthough jealousies between the various commandants caused some of the\nbands, luckily for themselves, to remain on the farther side of the\nmountains.\n\nAt length, everything being settled, we rode away, and reached the\nBushman's River camp on a certain Saturday afternoon. Here, to my joy,\nwe found all well. Nothing had been heard of Hernan Pereira, while the\nZulus, if we might judge from messengers who came to us, seemed to\nbe friendly. Marie, also, had now quite recovered from the fears and\nhardships which she had undergone. Never had I seen her look so sweet\nand beautiful as she did when she greeted me, arrayed no longer in\nrags, but in a simple yet charming dress made of some stuff that she\nhad managed to buy from a trader who came up to the camp from Durban.\nMoreover, I think that there was another reason for the change, since\nthe light of dawning happiness shone in her deep eyes.\n\nThe day, as I have said, was Saturday, and on the Monday she would come\nof age and be free to dispose of herself in marriage, for on that day\nlapsed the promise which we had given to her father. But, alas! by a\ncursed perversity of fate, on this very Monday at noon the Commandant\nRetief had arranged to ride into Zululand on his second visit to\nDingaan, and with Retief I was in honour bound to go.\n\n\"Marie,\" I said, \"will not your father soften towards us and let us be\nmarried to-morrow, so that we may have a few hours together before we\npart?\"\n\n\"I do not know, my dear,\" she answered, blushing, \"since about this\nmatter he is very strange and obstinate. Do you know that all the time\nyou were absent he never mentioned your name, and if anyone else spoke\nit he would get up and go away!\"\n\n\"That's bad,\" I said. \"Still, if you are willing, we might try.\"\n\n\"Indeed and indeed, Allan, I am willing, who am sick of being so near to\nyou and yet so far. But how shall we do so?\"\n\n\"I think that we will ask the Commandant Retief and the Vrouw Prinsloo\nto plead for us, Marie. Let us go to seek them.\"\n\nShe nodded, and hand in hand we walked through the Boers, who nudged\neach other and laughed at us as we passed to where the old vrouw was\nseated on a stool by her wagon drinking coffee. I remember that her\nvatdoek was spread over her knees, for she also had a new dress, which\nshe was afraid of staining.\n\n\"Well, my dears,\" she said in her loud voice, \"are you married already\nthat you hang so close together?\"\n\n\"No, my aunt,\" I answered; \"but we want to be, and have come to you to\nhelp us.\"\n\n\"That I will do with all my heart, though to speak truth, young people,\nat your age, as things are, I should have been inclined to help myself,\nas I have told you before. Heaven above us! what is it that makes\nmarriage in the sight of God? It is that male and female should declare\nthemselves man and wife before all folk, and live as such. The pastor\nand his mumblings are very well if you can get them, but it is the\ngiving of the hand, not the setting of the ring upon it; it is the\nvowing of two true hearts, and not words read out of a book, that make\nmarriage. Still, this is bold talk, for which any reverend pr\u00e9dicant\nwould reprove me, for if young folk acted on it, although the tie might\nhold good in law, what would become of his fee? Come, let us seek the\ncommandant and hear what he has to say. Allan, pull me up off this\nstool, where, if I had my way, after so much travelling, I should like\nto sit while a house was built over my head and for the rest of my\nlife.\"\n\nI obeyed, not without difficulty, and we went to find Retief.\n\nAt the moment he was standing alone, watching two wagons that had just\ntrekked away. These contained his wife with other members of his family,\nand some friends whom he was sending, under the charge of the Heer Smit,\nto a place called Doornkop, that lay at a distance of fifteen miles or\nmore. At this Doornkop he had already caused a rough house, or rather\nshed, to be built for the Vrouw Retief's occupation, thinking that she\nwould be more comfortable and perhaps safer there during his absence\nthan at the crowded camp in a wagon.\n\n\"Allemachte! Allan,\" he said, catching sight of me, \"my heart is sore;\nI do not know why. I tell you that when I kissed my old woman good-bye\njust now I felt as though I should never see her again, and the tears\ncame into my eyes. I wish we were all safe back from Dingaan. But there,\nthere, I will try to get over to see her to-morrow, as we don't start\ntill Monday. What is it that you want, Allan, with that 'mooi mesje' of\nyours?\"--and he pointed to the tall Marie.\n\n\"What would any man want with such a one, save to marry her?\" broke in\nthe Vrouw Prinsloo. \"Now, commandant, listen while I set out the tale.\"\n\n\"All right, aunt, only be brief, for I have no time to spare.\"\n\nShe obeyed, but I cannot say that she was brief.\n\nWhen at last the old lady paused, breathless, Retief said:\n\n\"I understand everything; there is no need for you young people to\ntalk. Now we will go and see Henri Marais, and, if he is not madder than\nusual, make him listen to reason.\"\n\nSo we walked to where Marais's wagon stood at the end of the line,\nand found him sitting on the disselboom cutting up tobacco with his\npocket-knife.\n\n\"Good-day, Allan,\" he said, for we had not met since my return. \"Have\nyou had a nice journey?\"\n\nI was about to answer when the commandant broke in impatiently:\n\n\"See here, see here, Henri, we have not come to talk about Allan's\njourney, but about his marriage, which is more important. He rides with\nme to Zululand on Monday, as you do, and wants to wed your daughter\nto-morrow, which is Sunday, a good day for the deed.\"\n\n\"It is a day to pray, not to give and be given in marriage,\" commented\nMarais sulkily. \"Moreover, Marie does not come of age before Monday, and\nuntil then the oath that I made to God holds.\"\n\n\"My vatdoek for your oath!\" exclaimed the vrouw, flapping that awful rag\nin his face. \"How much do you suppose that God cares what you in your\nfolly swore to that stinkcat of a nephew of yours? Do you be careful,\nHenri Marais, that God does not make of your precious oath a stone to\nfall upon your head and break it like a peanut-shell.\"\n\n\"Hold your chattering tongue, old woman,\" said Marais furiously. \"Am I\nto be taught my duty to my conscience and my daughter by you?\"\n\n\"Certainly you are, if you cannot teach them to yourself,\" began the\nvrouw, setting her hands upon her hips.\n\nBut Retief pushed her aside, saying:\n\n\"No quarrelling here. Now, Henri Marais, your conduct about these two\nyoung people who love each other is a scandal. Will you let them be\nmarried to-morrow or not?\"\n\n\"No, commandant, I will not. By the law I have power over my daughter\ntill she is of age, and I refuse to allow her to marry a cursed\nEnglishman. Moreover, the pr\u00e9dicant Celliers is away, so there is none\nto marry them.\"\n\n\"You speak strange words, Mynheer Marais,\" said Retief quietly,\n\"especially when I remember all that this 'cursed Englishman' has done\nfor you and yours, for I have heard every bit of that story, though not\nfrom him. Now hearken. You have appealed to the law, and, as commandant,\nI must allow your appeal. But after twelve o'clock to-morrow night,\naccording to your own showing, the law ceases to bind your daughter.\nTherefore, on Monday morning, if there is no clergyman in the camp and\nthese two wish it, I, as commandant, will marry them before all men, as\nI have the power to do.\"\n\nThen Marais broke into one of those raving fits of temper which were\nconstitutional in him, and to my mind showed that he was never quite\nsane. Oddly enough, it was on poor Marie that he concentrated his wrath.\nHe cursed her horribly because she had withstood his will and refused\nto marry Hernan Pereira. He prayed that evil might fall on her; that she\nmight never bear a child, and that if she did, it might die, and other\nthings too unpleasant to mention.\n\nWe stared at him astonished, though I think that had he been any other\nman than the father of my betrothed, I should have struck him. Retief,\nI noticed, lifted his hand to do so, then let it fall again, muttering:\n\"Let be; he is possessed with a devil.\"\n\nAt last Marais ceased, not, I think, from lack of words, but because\nhe was exhausted, and stood before us, his tall form quivering, and his\nthin, nervous face working like that of a person in convulsions. Then\nMarie, who had dropped her head beneath this storm, lifted it, and I saw\nthat her deep eyes were all ablaze and that she was very white.\n\n\"You are my father,\" she said in a low voice, \"and therefore I must\nsubmit to whatever you choose to say to me. Moreover, I think it likely\nthat the evil which you call down will fall upon me, since Satan is\nalways at hand to fulfil his own wishes. But if so, my father, I am\nsure that this evil will recoil upon your own head, not only here, but\nhereafter. There justice will be done to both of us, perhaps before very\nlong, and also to your nephew, Hernan Pereira.\"\n\nMarais made no answer; his rage seemed to have spent itself. He only sat\nhimself again upon the disselboom of the wagon and went on cutting up\nthe tobacco viciously, as though he were slicing the heart of a foe.\nEven the Vrouw Prinsloo was silent and stared at him whilst she fanned\nherself with the vatdoek. But Retief spoke.\n\n\"I wonder if you are mad, or only wicked, Henri Marais,\" he said. \"To\ncurse your own sweet girl like this you must be one or the other--a\nsingle child who has always been good to you. Well, as you are to ride\nwith me on Monday, I pray that you will keep your temper under control,\nlest it should bring us into trouble, and you also. As for you, Marie,\nmy dear, do not fret because a wild beast has tried to toss you with his\nhorns, although he happens to be your father. On Monday morning you\npass out of his power into your own, and on that day I will marry you to\nAllan Quatermain here. Meanwhile, I think you are safest away from this\nfather of yours, who might take to cutting your throat instead of that\ntobacco. Vrouw Prinsloo, be so good as to look after Marie Marais, and\non Monday morning next bring her before me to be wed. Until then, Henri\nMarais, I, as commandant, shall set a guard over you, with orders to\nseize you if it should be necessary. Now I advise you to take a walk,\nand when you are calm again, to pray God to forgive you your wicked\nwords, lest they should be fulfilled and drag you down to judgment.\"\n\nThen we all went, leaving Henri Marais still cutting up his tobacco on\nthe disselboom.\n\nOn the Sunday I met Marais walking about the camp, followed by the guard\nwhom Retief had set over him. To my surprise he greeted me almost with\naffection.\n\n\"Allan,\" he said, \"you must not misunderstand me. I do not really wish\nill to Marie, whom I love more dearly than I do my life; God alone knows\nhow much I love her. But I made a promise to her cousin, Hernan, my only\nsister's only child, and you will understand that I cannot break that\npromise, although Hernan has disappointed me in many ways--yes, in\nmany ways. But if he is bad, as they say, it comes with that Portuguese\nblood, which is a misfortune that he cannot help, does it not? However\nbad he may be, as an honest man I am bound to keep my promise, am I not?\nAlso, Allan, you must remember that you are English, and although you\nmay be a good fellow in yourself, that is a fault which you cannot\nexpect me to forgive. Still, if it is fated that you should marry my\ndaughter and breed English children--Heaven above! to think of it,\nEnglish children!--well, there is nothing more to be said. Don't\nremember the words I spoke to Marie. Indeed, I can't remember them\nmyself. When I grow angry, a kind of rush of blood comes into my brain,\nand then I forget what I have said,\" and he stretched out his hand to\nme.\n\nI shook it and answered that I understood he was not himself when he\nspoke those dreadful words, which both Marie and I wished to forget.\n\n\"I hope you will come to our wedding to-morrow,\" I added, \"and wipe them\nout with a father's blessing.\"\n\n\"To-morrow! Are you really going to be married to-morrow?\" he exclaimed,\nhis sallow face twitching nervously. \"O God, it was another man that\nI dreamed to see standing by Marie's side. But he is not here; he has\ndisgraced and deserted me. Well, I will come, if my gaolers will suffer\nit. Good-bye, you happy bridegroom of to-morrow, good-bye.\"\n\nThen he swung round and departed, followed by the guards, one of whom\ntouched his brow and shook his head significantly as he passed me.\n\nI think that Sunday seemed the longest day I ever spent. The Vrouw\nPrinsloo would scarcely allow me even a glimpse of Marie, because of\nsome fad she had got into her mind that it was either not proper or not\nfortunate, I forget which, that a bride and bridegroom should associate\non the eve of their marriage. So I occupied myself as best I could.\nFirst I wrote a long letter to my father, the third that I had sent,\ntelling him everything that was going to happen, and saying how grieved\nI was that he could not be present to marry us and give us his blessing.\n\nThis letter I gave to a trader who was trekking to the bay on the\nfollowing morning, begging him to forward it by the first opportunity.\n\nThat duty done, I saw about the horses which I was taking into Zululand,\nthree of them, two for myself and one for Hans, who accompanied me as\nafter-rider. Also the saddlery, saddle-bags, guns and ammunition must be\noverhauled, all of which took some time.\n\n\"You are going to spend a strange wittebroodsweek [white-bread-week, or,\nin other words, honeymoon], baas,\" said Hans, squinting at me with his\nlittle eyes, as he brayed away at a buckskin which was to serve as a\nsaddle-cloth. \"Now, if _I_ was to be married to-morrow, I should stop\nwith my pretty for a few days, and only ride off somewhere else when\nI was tired of her, especially if that somewhere else chanced to be\nZululand, where they are so fond of killing people.\"\n\n\"I dare say you would, Hans; and so would I, if I could, you be sure.\nBut, you see, the commandant wants me to interpret, and therefore it is\nmy duty to go with him.\"\n\n\"Duty; what is duty, baas? Love I understand. It is for love of you that\nI go with you; also for fear lest you should cause me to be beaten if I\nrefused. Otherwise I would certainly stop here in the camp, where there\nis plenty to eat and little work to do, as, were I you, I should do also\nfor love of that white missie. But duty--pah! that is a fool-word, which\nmakes bones of a man before his time and leaves his girl to others.\"\n\n\"Of course, you do not understand, Hans, any more than you coloured\npeople understand what gratitude is. But what do you mean about this\ntrek of ours? Are you afraid?\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \"A little, perhaps, baas. At least, I should\nbe if I thought about the morrow, which I don't, since to-day is enough\nfor me, and thinking about what one can't know makes the head ache.\nDingaan is not a nice man, baas; we saw that, didn't we? He is a hunter\nwho knows how to set a trap. Also he has the Baas Pereira up there to\nhelp him. So perhaps you might be more comfortable here kissing Missie\nMarie. Why do you not say that you have hurt your leg and cannot run?\nIt would not be much trouble to walk about on a crutch for a day or two,\nand when the commandant was well gone, your leg might heal and you could\nthrow the stick away.\"\n\n\"Get thee behind me, Satan,\" I muttered to myself, and was about to give\nHans a piece of my mind when I recollected that the poor fellow had his\nown way of looking at things and could not be blamed. Also, as he said,\nhe loved me, and only suggested what he thought would tend to my joy and\nsafety. How could I suppose that he would be interested in the success\nof a diplomatic mission to Dingaan, or think anything about it except\nthat it was a risky business? So I only said:\n\n\"Hans, if you are afraid, you had better stop behind. I can easily find\nanother after-rider.\"\n\n\"Is the baas angry with me that he should speak so?\" asked the\nHottentot. \"Have I not always been true to him; and if I should be\nkilled, what does it matter? Have I not said that I do not think about\nto-morrow, and we must all go to sleep sometime? No; unless the baas\nbeats me back, I shall come with him. But, baas\"--this in a wheedling\ntone--\"you might give me some brandy to drink your health in to-night.\nIt is very good to get drunk when one has to be sober, and perhaps dead,\nfor a long time afterwards. It would be nice to remember when one is a\nspook, or an angel with white wings, such as the old baas, your father,\nused to tell us about in school on the Sabbath.\"\n\nAt this point, finding Hans hopeless, I got up and walked away, leaving\nhim to finish our preparations.\n\nThat evening there was a prayer-meeting in the camp, for although no\npastor was present, one of the Boer elders took his place and offered\nup supplications which, if simple and even absurd in their wording, at\nleast were hearty enough. Amongst other requests, I remember that he\npetitioned for the safety of those who were to go on the mission to\nDingaan and of those who were to remain behind. Alas! those prayers\nwere not heard, for it pleased the Power to Whom they were addressed to\ndecree otherwise.\n\nAfter this meeting, in which I took an earnest share, Retief who just\nbefore it began had ridden in from Doornkop, whither he had been to\nvisit his wife, held a kind of council, whereat the names of those who\nhad volunteered or been ordered to accompany him, were finally taken\ndown. At this council there was a good deal of discussion, since many of\nthe Boers did not think the expedition wise--at any rate, if it was to\nbe carried out on so large a scale. One of them, I forget which, an old\nman, pointed out that it might look like a war party, and that it would\nbe wiser if only five or six went, as they had done before, since then\nthere could be no mistake as to the peaceful nature of their intentions.\n\nRetief himself combated this view, and at last turned suddenly to me,\nwho was listening near by, and said:\n\n\"Allan Quatermain, you are young, but you have a good judgment; also,\nyou are one of the very few who know Dingaan and can speak his language.\nTell us now, what do you think?\"\n\nThus adjured, I answered, perhaps moved thereto more than I thought\nby Hans's talk, that I, too, considered the thing dangerous, and that\nsomeone whose life was less valuable than the commandant's should go in\ncommand.\n\n\"Why do you say so, nephew,\" he said irritably, \"seeing that all\nwhite men's lives are of equal value, and I can smell no danger in the\nbusiness?\"\n\n\"Because, commandant, I do smell danger, though what danger I cannot\nsay, any more than a dog or a buck can when it sniffs something in the\nair and barks or runs. Dingaan is a tamed tiger just now, but tigers are\nnot house cats that one can play with them, as I know, who have felt his\nclaws and just, only just, come out from between them.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, nephew?\" asked Retief in his direct fashion. \"Do you\nbelieve that this swartzel\" (that is, black creature) \"means to kill\nus?\"\n\n\"I believe that it is quite possible,\" I answered.\n\n\"Then, nephew, being a reasonable man as you are, you must have some\nground for your belief. Come now, out with it.\"\n\n\"I have none, commandant, except that one who can set the lives of a\ndozen folk against a man's skill in shooting at birds on the wing,\nand who can kill people to be a bait for those birds, is capable of\nanything. Moreover, he told me that he did not love you Boers, and why\nshould he?\"\n\nNow, all those who were standing about seemed to be impressed with this\nargument. At any rate, they turned towards Retief, anxiously waiting for\nhis reply.\n\n\"Doubtless,\" answered the commandant, who, as I have said, was irritable\nthat night, \"doubtless those English missionaries have poisoned the\nking's mind against us Boers. Also,\" he added suspiciously, \"I think you\ntold me, Allan, that the king said he liked you and meant to spare you,\neven if he killed your companions, just because you also are English.\nAre you sure that you do not know more than you choose to tell us?\nHas Dingaan perhaps confided something to you--just because you are\nEnglish?\"\n\nThen noting that these words moved the assembled Boers, in whom race\nprejudice and recent events had created a deep distrust of any born of\nBritish blood, I grew very angry and answered:\n\n\"Commandant, Dingaan confided nothing to me, except that some Kaffir\nwitch-doctor, who is named Zikali, a man I never saw, had told him that\nhe must not kill an Englishman, and therefore he wished to spare me,\nalthough one of your people, Hernan Pereira, had whispered to him that\nI ought to be killed. Yet I say outright that I think you are foolish to\nvisit this king with so large a force. Still, I am ready to do so myself\nwith one or two others. Let me go, then, and try to persuade him to sign\nthis treaty as to the land. If I am killed or fail, you can follow after\nme and do better.\"\n\n\"Allemachte!\" exclaimed Retief; \"that is a fair offer. But how do I\nknow, nephew, that when we came to read the treaty we should not find\nthat it granted all the land to you English and not to us Boers? No, no,\ndon't look angry. That was not a right thing to say, for you are honest\nwhatever most of your blood may be. Nephew Allan, you who are a brave\nman, are afraid of this journey. Now, why is that, I wonder? Ah! I have\nit. I had forgotten. You are to be married to-morrow morning to a very\npretty girl, and it is not natural that you should wish to spend the\nnext fortnight in Zululand. Don't you see, brothers, he wants to get\nout of it because he is going to be married, as it is natural that he\nshould, and therefore he tries to frighten us all? When we were going\nto be married, should we have wished to ride away at once to visit\nsome stinking savage? Ach! I am glad I thought of that just as I was\nbeginning to turn his gloomy colour, like a chameleon on a black hat,\nfor it explains everything,\" and he struck his thigh with his big hand\nand burst into a roar of laughter.\n\nAll the company of Boers who stood around began to laugh also,\nuproariously, for this primitive joke appealed to them. Moreover, their\nnerves were strained; they also dreaded this expedition, and therefore\nthey were glad to relieve themselves in bucolic merriment. Everything\nwas clear to them now. Feeling myself in honour bound to go on the\nembassy, as I was their only interpreter, I, artful dog, was trying to\nplay upon their fears in order to prevent it from starting, so that I\nmight have a week or two of the company of my new-wed wife. They saw and\nappreciated the joke.\n\n\"He's slim, this little Englishman,\" shouted one.\n\n\"Don't be angry with him. We should have done as much ourselves,\"\nreplied another.\n\n\"Leave him behind,\" said a third. \"Even the Zulus do not send a\nnew-married man on service.\" Then they smacked me on the back, and\nhustled me in their rude, kindly manner, till at length I fell into\na rage and hit one of them on the nose, at which he only laughed the\nlouder, although I made it bleed.\n\n\"See here, friends,\" I said, as soon as silence was restored; \"married\nor no, whoever does not ride to Dingaan, I ride to him, although it is\nagainst my judgment. Let those laugh loudest who laugh last.\"\n\n\"Good!\" cried one; \"if you set the pace we shall soon be home again,\nAllan Quatermain. Who would not with Marie Marais at the end of the\njourney?\"\n\nThen, followed by their rough and mocking laughter, I broke away from\nthem, and took refuge in my wagon, little guessing that all this talk\nwould be brought up against me on a day to come.\n\nIn a certain class of uneducated mind foresight is often interpreted as\nguilty knowledge.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. THE MARRIAGE\n\n\nI was awakened on my wedding morning by the crash and bellowing of\na great thunderstorm. The lightning flashed fearfully all about us,\nkilling two oxen quite near to my wagon, and the thunder rolled and\nechoed till the very earth seemed to shake. Then came a wail of cold\nwind, and after that the swish of torrential rain. Although I was well\naccustomed to such natural manifestations, especially at this season of\nthe year, I confess that these sights and sounds did not tend to raise\nmy spirits, which were already lower than they should have been on\nthat eventful day. Hans, however, who arrived to help me put on my best\nclothes for the ceremony, was for once consoling.\n\n\"Don't look sick, baas,\" he said, \"for if there is storm in the morning,\nthere is shine at night.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered, speaking more to myself than to him, \"but what will\nhappen between the storm of the morning and the peace of the night?\"\n\nIt was arranged that the commission, which, counting the native\nafter-riders, consisted of over a hundred people, among them several\nboys, who were little more than children, was to ride at one hour before\nnoon. Nobody could get about to make the necessary preparations until\nthe heavy rain had passed away, which it did a little after eight\no'clock. Therefore when I left the wagon to eat, or try to eat some\nbreakfast, I found the whole camp in a state of bustle.\n\nBoers were shouting to their servants, horses were being examined, women\nwere packing the saddle-bags of their husbands and fathers with spare\nclothes, the pack-beasts were being laden with biltong and other\nprovisions, and so forth.\n\nIn the midst of all this tumult I began to wonder whether my private\nbusiness would not be forgotten, since it seemed unlikely that time\ncould be found for marriages. However, about ten o'clock when, having\ndone everything that I had to do, I was sitting disconsolately upon my\nwagon box, being too shy to mix with that crowd of busy mockers or to go\nto the Prinsloos' camp to make inquiries, the vrouw herself appeared.\n\n\"Come on, Allan,\" she said, \"the commandant is waiting and swearing\nbecause you are not there. Also, there is another waiting, and oh! she\nlooks lovely. When they see her, every man in the camp will want her for\nhimself, whether he has got a wife or not, for in that matter, although\nyou mayn't think so just now, they are all the same as the Kaffirs. Oh!\nI know them, I know them, a white skin makes no difference.\"\n\nWhile she held forth thus in her usual outspoken fashion, the vrouw was\ndragging me along by the hand, just as though I were a naughty little\nboy. Nor could I get free from that mighty grip, or, when once her great\nbulk was in motion, match my weight against it. Of course, some of the\nyounger Boers, who, knowing her errand, had followed her, set up a shout\nof cheers and laughter, which attracted everybody to the procession.\n\n\"It is too late to hang back now, Englishman.\" \"You must make the best\nof a bad business.\" \"If you wanted to change your mind, you should have\ndone it before,\" men and women roared and screamed with many other such\nbantering words, till at length I felt myself turn the colour of a red\nvlei lily.\n\nSo we came at last to where Marie stood, the centre of an admiring\ncircle. She was clothed in a soft white gown made of some simple but\nbecoming stuff, and she wore upon her dark hair a wreath woven by the\nother maidens in the camp, a bevy of whom stood behind her.\n\nNow we were face to face. Our eyes met, and oh! hers were full of love\nand trust. They dazzled and bewildered me. Feeling that I ought to\nspeak, and not knowing what to say, I merely stammered \"Good morning,\"\nwhereon everyone broke into a roar of laughter, except Vrouw Prinsloo,\nwho exclaimed:\n\n\"Did any one ever see such a fool?\" and even Marie smiled.\n\nThen Piet Retief appeared from somewhere dressed in tall boots and rough\nriding clothes, such as the Boers wore in those days. Handing the roer\nhe was carrying to one of his sons, after much fumbling he produced\na book from his pocket, in which the place was marked with a piece of\ngrass.\n\n\"Now then,\" he said, \"be silent, all, and show respect, for remember I\nam not a man just now. I am a parson, which is quite a different thing,\nand, being a commandant and a veld cornet and other officers all rolled\ninto one, by virtue of the law I am about to marry these young people,\nso help me God. Don't any of you witnesses ever say afterwards that they\nare not rightly and soundly married, because I tell you that they are,\nor will be.\" He paused for breath, and someone said, \"Hear, hear,\" or\nits Dutch equivalent, whereon, having glared the offender into silence,\nRetief proceeded:\n\n\"Young man and young woman, what are your names?\"\n\n\"Don't ask silly questions, commandant,\" broke in Vrouw Prinsloo; \"you\nknow their names well enough.\"\n\n\"Of course I do, aunt,\" he answered; \"but for this purpose I must\npretend not to know them. Are you better acquainted with the law than I\nam? But stay, where is the father, Henri Marais?\"\n\nSomeone thrust Marais forward, and there he stood quite silent, staring\nat us with a queer look upon his face and his gun in his hand, for he,\ntoo, was ready to ride.\n\n\"Take away that gun,\" said Retief; \"it might go off and cause\ndisturbance or perhaps accidents,\" and somebody obeyed. \"Now, Henri\nMarais, do you give your daughter to be married to this man?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Marais softly.\n\n\"Very well, that is just like you, but it doesn't matter, for she is of\nage and can give herself. Is she not of age, Henri Marais? Don't stand\nthere like a horse with the staggers, but tell me; is she not of age?\"\n\n\"I believe so,\" he answered in the same soft voice.\n\n\"Then take notice, people all, that this woman is of age, and gives\nherself to be married to this man, don't you, my dear?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Marie.\n\n\"All right, now for it,\" and, opening the book, he held it up to the\nlight, and began to read, or, rather, to stumble, through the marriage\nservice.\n\nPresently he stuck fast, being, like most Boers of his time, no great\nscholar, and exclaimed:\n\n\"Here, one of you help me with these hard words.\"\n\nAs nobody volunteered, Retief handed the book to me, for he knew that\nMarais would not assist him, saying:\n\n\"You are a scholar, Allan, being a clergyman's son. Read on till we come\nto the important bits, and I will say the words after you, which will do\njust as well and be quite according to law.\"\n\nSo I read, Heaven knows how, for the situation was trying enough, until\nI came to the crucial questions, when I gave the book back.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Retief; \"this is quite easy. Now then, Allan, do you take\nthis woman to be your wife? Answer, putting in your name, which is left\nblank in the book.\"\n\nI replied that I did, and the question was repeated to Marie, who did\nlikewise.\n\n\"Well then, there you are,\" said Retief, \"for I won't trouble you with\nall the prayers, which I don't feel myself parson enough to say. Oh! no,\nI forgot. Have you a ring?\"\n\nI drew one off my finger that had been my mother's--I believe it had\nserved this same purpose at the wedding of her grandmother--and set the\nthin little hoop of gold upon the third finger of Marie's left hand. I\nstill wear that ring to-day.\n\n\"It should have been a new one,\" muttered Vrouw Prinsloo.\n\n\"Be silent, aunt,\" said Retief; \"are there any jewellers' shops here in\nthe veld? A ring is a ring, even if it came off a horse's bit. There, I\nthink that is all. No, wait a minute, I am going to say a prayer of my\nown over you, not one out of this book, which is so badly printed that\nI cannot read it. Kneel down, both of you; the rest may stand, as the\ngrass is so wet.\"\n\nNow, bethinking herself of Marie's new dress, the vrouw produced her\nvatdoek from a capacious pocket, and doubled up that dingy article for\nMarie to kneel on, which she did. Then Pieter Retief, flinging down\nthe book, clasped his hands and uttered this simple, earnest prayer,\nwhereof, strangely enough, every word remains fast in my mind. Coming\nas it did, not from a printed page, but from his honest and believing\nheart, it was very impressive and solemn.\n\n\"O God above us, Who sees all and is with us when we are born, when we\nare married, when we die, and if we do our duty for all time afterwards\nin Heaven, hear our prayer. I pray Thee bless this man and this woman\nwho appear here before Thee to be wed. Make them love each other truly\nall their lives, be these long or short, be they sick or well, be they\nhappy or in sorrow, be they rich or poor. Give them children to be\nreared up in Thy Word, give them an honest name and the respect of all\nwho know them, and at last give them Thy Salvation through the Blood of\nJesus the Saviour. If they are together, let them rejoice in each other.\nIf they are apart, let them not forget each other. If one of them dies\nand the other lives, let that one who lives look forward to the day of\nreunion and bow the head to Thy Will, and keep that one who dies in Thy\nholy Hand. O Thou Who knowest all things, guide the lives of these\ntwo according to Thy eternal purpose, and teach them to be sure that\nwhatever Thou doest, is done for the best. For Thou art a faithful\nCreator, Who wishes good to His children and not evil, and at the last\nThou wilt give them that good if they do but trust in Thee through\ndaylight and through darkness. Now let no man dare to put asunder those\nwhom Thou hast joined together, O Lord God Almighty, Father of us all.\nAmen.\"\n\nSo he prayed, and all the company echoed that Amen from their hearts.\nThat is all except one, for Henri Marais turned his back on us and\nwalked away.\n\n\"So,\" said Retief, wiping his brow with the sleeve of his coat, \"you are\nthe last couple that ever I mean to marry. The work is too hard for a\nlayman who has bad sight for print. Now kiss each other; it is the right\nthing to do.\"\n\nSo we kissed, and the congregation cheered.\n\n\"Allan,\" went on the commandant, pulling out a silver watch like a\nturnip, \"you have just half an hour before we ride, and the Vrouw\nPrinsloo says that she has made you a wedding meal in that tent there,\nso you had best go eat it.\"\n\nTo the tent we went accordingly, to find a simple but bounteous feast\nprepared, of which we partook, helping each other to food, as is, or\nwas, the custom with new-wedded folk. Also, many Boers came in and drank\nour healths, although the Vrouw Prinsloo told them that it would have\nbeen more decent to leave us alone. But Henri Marais did not come or\ndrink our healths.\n\nThus the half-hour went all too swiftly, and not a word did we get\nalone. At last in despair, seeing that Hans was already waiting with the\nhorses, I drew Marie aside, motioning to everyone to stand back.\n\n\"Dearest wife,\" I said in broken words, \"this is a strange beginning to\nour married life, but you see it can't be helped.\"\n\n\"No, Allan,\" she answered, \"it can't be helped; but oh! I wish my heart\nwere happier about your journey. I fear Dingaan, and if anything should\nchance to you I shall die of grief.\"\n\n\"Why should anything chance, Marie? We are a strong and well-armed\nparty, and Dingaan looks on us peacefully.\"\n\n\"I don't know, husband, but they say Hernan Pereira is with the Zulus,\nand he hates you.\"\n\n\"Then he had better mind his manners, or he will not be here long to\nhate anybody,\" I answered grimly, for my gorge rose at the thought of\nthis man and his treacheries.\n\n\"Vrouw Prinsloo,\" I called to the old lady, who was near, \"be pleased to\ncome hither and listen. And, Marie, do you listen also. If by chance I\nshould hear anything affecting your safety, and send you a message\nby someone you can trust, such as that you should remove yourselves\nelsewhere or hide, promise me that you will obey it without question.\"\n\n\"Of course I will obey you, husband. Have I not just sworn to do so?\"\nMarie said with a sad smile.\n\n\"And so will I, Allan,\" said the vrouw; \"not because I have sworn\nanything, but because I know you have a good head on your shoulders, and\nso will my man and the others of our party. Though why you should\nthink you will have any message to send, I can't guess, unless you know\nsomething that is hidden from us,\" she added shrewdly. \"You say you\ndon't; well, it is not likely you would tell us if you did. Look! They\nare calling, you must go. Come on, Marie, let us see them off.\"\n\nSo we went to where the commission was gathered on horseback, just in\ntime to hear Retief addressing the people, or, rather, the last of his\nwords.\n\n\"Friends,\" he said, \"we go upon an important business, from which I\nhope we shall return happily within a very little time. Still, this is\na rough country, and we have to deal with rough people. Therefore my\nadvice to all you who stay behind is that you should not scatter, but\nkeep together, so that in case of any trouble the men who are left may\nbe at hand to defend this camp. For if they are here you have nothing\nto fear from all the savages in Africa. And now God be with you, and\ngood-bye. Come, trek, brothers, trek!\"\n\nThen followed a few moments of confusion while men kissed their wives,\nchildren and sisters in farewell, or shook each other by the hand. I,\ntoo, kissed Marie, and, tumbling on to my horse somehow, rode away, my\neyes blind with tears, for this parting was bitter. When I could see\nclearly again I pulled up and looked back at the camp, which was now at\nsome distance. It seemed a peaceful place indeed, for although the storm\nof the morning was returning and a pall of dark cloud hung over it, the\nsun still shone upon the white wagon caps and the people who went to and\nfro among them.\n\nWho could have thought that within a little time it would be but a field\nof blood, that those wagons would be riddled with assegais, and that the\nwomen and children who were moving there must most of them lie upon\nthe veld mutilated corpses dreadful to behold? Alas! the Boers, always\nimpatient of authority and confident that their own individual judgment\nwas the best, did not obey their commandant's order to keep together.\nThey went off this way and that, to shoot the game which was then so\nplentiful, leaving their families almost without protection. Thus the\nZulus found and slew them.\n\nPresently as I rode forward a little apart from the others someone\novertook me, and I saw that it was Henri Marais.\n\n\"Well, Allan,\" he said, \"so God has given you to me for a son-in-law.\nWho would have thought it? You do not look to me like a new-married\nman, for that marriage is not natural when the bridegroom rides off and\nleaves the bride of an hour. Perhaps you will never be really married\nafter all, for God, Who gives sons-in-law, can also take them away,\nespecially when He was not asked for them. Ah!\" he went on, lapsing into\nFrench, as was his wont when moved, \"qui vivra verra! qui vivra verra!\"\nThen, shouting this excellent but obvious proverb at the top of his\nvoice, he struck his horse with the butt of his gun, and galloped away\nbefore I could answer him.\n\nAt that moment I hated Henri Marais as I had never hated anyone before,\nnot even his nephew Hernan. Almost did I ride to the commandant to\ncomplain of him, but reflecting to myself, first that he was undoubtedly\nhalf mad, and therefore not responsible for his actions, and secondly\nthat he was better here with us than in the same camp with my wife,\nI gave up the idea. Yet alas! it is the half-mad who are the most\ndangerous of lunatics.\n\nHans, who had observed this scene and overheard all Marais's talk,\nand who also knew the state of the case well enough, sidled his horse\nalongside of me, and whispered in a wheedling voice:\n\n\"Baas, I think the old baas is kransick and not safe. He looks like one\nwho is going to harm someone. Now, baas, suppose I let my gun off by\naccident; you know we coloured people are very careless with guns! The\nHeer Marais would never be troubled with any more fancies, and you and\nthe Missie Marie and all of us would be safer. Also, _you_ could not\nbe blamed, nor could I, for who can help an accident? Guns will go off\nsometimes, baas, when you don't want them to.\"\n\n\"Get out,\" I answered. Yet if Hans's gun had chanced to \"go off,\" I\nbelieve it might have saved a multitude of lives!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. THE TREATY\n\n\nOur journey to Umgungundhlovu was prosperous and without incident. When\nwe were within half a day's march from the Great Kraal we overtook the\nherd of cattle that we had recaptured from Sikonyela, for these beasts\nhad been driven very slowly and well rested that they might arrive in\ngood condition. Also the commandant was anxious that we should present\nthem ourselves to the king.\n\nDriving this multitude of animals before us--there were over five\nthousand head of them--we reached the Great Place on Saturday the 3rd of\nFebruary about midday, and forced them through its gates into the cattle\nkraals. Then we off-saddled and ate our dinner under those two milk\ntrees near the gate of the kraal where I had bid good-bye to Dingaan.\n\nAfter dinner messengers came to ask us to visit the king, and with them\nthe youth, Thomas Halstead, who told the commandant that all weapons\nmust be left behind, since it was the Zulu law that no man might appear\nbefore the king armed. To this Retief demurred, whereon the messengers\nappealed to me, whom they had recognised, asking if that were not the\ncustom of their country.\n\nI answered that I had not been in it long enough to know. Then there was\na pause while they sent for someone to bear evidence; at the time I\ndid not know whom, as I was not near enough to Thomas Halstead to make\ninquiries. Presently this someone appeared, and turned out to be none\nother than Hernan Pereira.\n\nHe advanced towards us attended by Zulus, as though he were a chief,\nlooking fat and well and handsomer than ever. Seeing Retief, he lifted\nhis hat with a flourish and held out his hand, which, I noted, the\ncommandant did not take.\n\n\"So you are still here, Mynheer Pereira!\" he said coldly. \"Now be good\nenough to tell me, what is this matter about the abandoning of our\narms?\"\n\n\"The king charges me to say--\" began Hernan.\n\n\"Charges you to say, Mynheer Pereira! Are you then this black man's\nservant? But continue.\"\n\n\"That none must come into his private enclosure armed.\"\n\n\"Well, then, mynheer, be pleased to go tell this king that we do not\nwish to come to his private enclosure. I have brought the cattle that he\ndesired me to fetch, and I am willing to deliver them to him wherever he\nwishes, but we will not unarm in order to do so.\"\n\nNow there was talk, and messengers were despatched, who returned at full\nspeed presently to say that Dingaan would receive the Boers in the great\ndancing place in the midst of the kraal, and that they might bring their\nguns, as he wished to see how they fired them.\n\nSo we rode in, making as fine a show as we could, to find that the\ndancing place, which measured a good many acres in extent, was lined\nround with thousands of plumed but unarmed warriors arranged in\nregiments.\n\n\"You see,\" I heard Pereira say to Retief, \"these have no spears.\"\n\n\"No,\" answered the commandant, \"but they have sticks, which when they\nare a hundred to one would serve as well.\"\n\nMeanwhile the vast mob of cattle were being driven in a double stream\npast a knot of men at the head of the space, and then away through gates\nbehind. When the beasts had all gone we approached these men, among whom\nI recognised the fat form of Dingaan draped in a bead mantle. We ranged\nourselves in a semicircle before him, and stood while he searched us\nwith his sharp eyes. Presently he saw me, and sent a councillor to say\nthat I must come and interpret for him.\n\nSo, dismounting, I went with Retief, Thomas Halstead, and a few of the\nleading Boers.\n\n\"Sakubona [Good day], Macumazahn,\" said Dingaan. \"I am glad that you\nhave come, as I know that you will speak my words truly, being one of\nthe People of George whom I love, for Tho-maas here I do not trust,\nalthough he is also a Son of George.\"\n\nI told Retief what he said.\n\n\"Oh!\" he exclaimed with a grunt, \"it seems that you English are a step\nin front of us Boers, even here.\"\n\nThen he went forward and shook hands with the king, whom, it will be\nremembered, he had visited before.\n\nAfter that the \"indaba\" or talk began, which I do not propose to set\nout at length, for it is a matter of history. It is enough to say that\nDingaan, after thanking Retief for recovering the cattle, asked where\nwas Sikonyela, the chief who had stolen them, as he wished to kill him.\nWhen he learned that Sikonyela remained in his own country, he became,\nor affected to become, angry. Then he asked where were the sixty horses\nwhich he heard we had captured from Sikonyela, as they must be given up\nto him.\n\nRetief, by way of reply, touched his grey hairs, and inquired whether\nDingaan thought that he was a child that he, Dingaan, should demand\nhorses which did not belong to him. He added that these horses had been\nrestored to the Boers, from whom Sikonyela had stolen them.\n\nWhen Dingaan had expressed himself satisfied with this answer, Retief\nopened the question of the treaty. The king replied however, that the\nwhite men had but just arrived, and he wished to see them dance after\ntheir own fashion. As for the business, it might \"sit still\" till\nanother day.\n\nSo in the end the Boers \"danced\" for his amusement. That is, they\ndivided into two parties, and charged each other at full gallop, firing\ntheir guns into the air, an exhibition which seemed to fill all present\nwith admiration and awe. When they paused, the king wished them to go on\nfiring \"a hundred shots apiece,\" but the commandant declined, saying he\nhad no more powder to waste.\n\n\"What do you want powder for in a peaceful country?\" asked Dingaan\nsuspiciously.\n\nRetief answered through me:\n\n\"To kill food for ourselves, or to protect ourselves if any evil-minded\nmen should attack us.\"\n\n\"Then it will not be wanted here,\" said Dingaan, \"since I will give you\nfood, and as I, the king, am your friend, no man in Zululand dare be\nyour enemy.\"\n\nRetief said he was glad to hear it, and asked leave to retire with the\nBoers to his camp outside the gate, as they were all tired with riding.\nThis Dingaan granted, and we said good-bye and went away. Before I\nreached the gate, however, a messenger, I remember it was my old friend\nKambula, overtook me, and said that the king wished to speak with me\nalone. I answered him that I could not speak with the king alone without\nthe permission of the commandant. Thereon Kambula said:\n\n\"Come with me, I pray you, O Macumazahn, since otherwise you will be\ntaken by force.\"\n\nNow, I told Hans to gallop on to Retief, and tell him of my predicament,\nfor already I saw that at some sign from Kambula I was being surrounded\nby Zulus. He did so, and presently Retief came back himself accompanied\nonly by one man, and asked me what was the matter now. I informed him,\ntranslating Kambula's words, which he repeated in his presence.\n\n\"Does the fellow mean that you will be seized if you do not go, or I\nrefuse to allow you to do so?\"\n\nTo this question Kambula's answer was:\n\n\"That is so, Inkoos, since the king has private words for the ear of\nMacumazahn. Therefore we must obey orders, and take him before the king,\nliving or dead.\"\n\n\"Allemachte!\" exclaimed Retief, \"this is serious,\" and, as though to\nsummon them to my help, he looked behind him towards the main body of\nthe Boers, who by this time were nearly all of them through the gate,\nwhich was guarded by a great number of Zulus. \"Allan,\" he went on, \"if\nyou are not afraid, I think that you must go. Perhaps it is only that\nDingaan has some message about the treaty to send to me through you.\"\n\n\"I am not afraid,\" I answered. \"What is the use of being afraid in a\nplace like this?\"\n\n\"Ask that Kaffir if the king gives you safe conduct,\" said Retief.\n\nI did so, and Kambula answered:\n\n\"Yes, for this visit. Who am I that I can speak the king's unspoken\nwords?\" [which meant, guarantee his will in the future.]\n\n\"A dark saying,\" commented Retief. \"But go, Allan, since you must, and\nGod bring you back safe again. It is clear that Dingaan did not ask that\nyou should come with me for nothing. Now I wish I had left you at home\nwith that pretty wife of yours.\"\n\nSo we parted, I going to the king's private enclosure on foot and\nwithout my rifle, since I was not allowed to appear before him armed,\nand the commandant towards the gate of the kraal accompanied by Hans,\nwho led my horse. Ten minutes later I stood before Dingaan, who greeted\nme kindly enough, and began to ask a number of questions about the\nBoers, especially if they were not people who had rebelled against their\nown king and run away from him.\n\nI answered, Yes, they had run away, as they wanted more room to live;\nbut I had told him all about that when I saw him before. He said he knew\nI had, but he wished to hear \"whether the same words came out of the\nsame mouth, or different words,\" so that he might know if I were a true\nman or not. Then, after pausing a while, he looked at me in his piercing\nfashion and asked:\n\n\"Have you brought me a present of that tall white girl with eyes like\ntwo stars, Macumazahn? I mean the girl whom you refused to me, and whom\nI could not take because you had won your bet, which gave all the white\npeople to you; she for whose sake you make brothers of these Boers, who\nare traitors to their king?\"\n\n\"No, O Dingaan,\" I answered; \"there are no women among us. Moreover,\nthis maid is now my wife.\"\n\n\"Your wife!\" he exclaimed angrily. \"By the Head of the Black One, have\nyou dared to make a wife of her whom I desired? Now say, boy, you clever\nWatcher by Night; you little white ant, who work in the dark and only\npeep out at the end of your tunnel when it is finished; you wizard, who\nby your magic can snatch his prey out of the hand of the greatest king\nin all the world--for it was magic that killed those vultures on Hloma\nAmabutu, not your bullets, Macumazahn--say, why should I not make an end\nof you at once for this trick?\"\n\nI folded my arms and looked at him. A strange contrast we must have\nmade, this huge, black tyrant with the royal air, for to do him justice\nhe had that, at whose nod hundreds went the way of death, and I, a mere\ninsignificant white boy, for in appearance, at any rate, I was nothing\nmore.\n\n\"O Dingaan,\" I said coolly, knowing that coolness was my only chance,\n\"I answer you in the words of the Commandant Retief, the great chief.\nDo you take me for a child that I should give up my own wife to you who\nalready have so many? Moreover, you cannot kill me because I have the\nword of your captain, Kambula, that I am safe with you.\"\n\nThis reply seemed to amuse him. At any rate, with one of those almost\ninfantile changes of mood which are common to savages of every degree,\nhe passed from wrath to laughter.\n\n\"You are quick as a lizard,\" he said. \"Why should I, who have so many\nwives, want one more, who would certainly hate me? Just because she is\nwhite, and would make the others, who are black, jealous, I suppose.\nIndeed, they would poison her, or pinch her to death in a month, and\nthen come to tell me she had died of fretting. Also, you are right; you\nhave my safe conduct, and must go hence unharmed this time. But look\nyou, little lizard, although you escape me between the stones, I will\npull off your tail. I have said that I want to pluck this tall white\nflower of yours, and I will pluck her. I know where she dwells. Yes,\njust where the wagon she sleeps in stands in the line, for my spies have\ntold me, and I will give orders that whoever is killed, she is to be\nspared and brought to me living. So perhaps you will meet this wife of\nyours here, Macumazahn.\"\n\nNow, at these ominous words, that might mean so much or so little, the\nsweat started to my brow, and a shiver went down my back.\n\n\"Perhaps I shall and perhaps I shall not, O king,\" I answered. \"The\nworld is as full of chances to-day as it was not long ago when I shot at\nthe sacred vultures on Hloma Amabutu. Still, I think that my wife will\nnever be yours, O king.\"\n\n\"Ow!\" said Dingaan; \"this little white ant is making another tunnel,\nthinking that he will come up at my back. But what if I put down my heel\nand crush you, little white ant? Do you know,\" he added confidentially,\n\"that the Boer who mends my guns and whom here we call 'Two-faces,'\nbecause he looks towards you Whites with one eye and towards us Blacks\nwith the other, is still very anxious that I should kill you? Indeed,\nwhen I told him that my spies said that you were to ride with the Boers,\nas I had requested that you should be their Tongue, he answered that\nunless I promised to give you to the vultures, he would warn them\nagainst coming. So, since I wanted them to come as I had arranged with\nhim, I promised.\"\n\n\"Is it so, O king?\" I asked. \"And pray why does this Two-faces, whom we\nname Pereira, desire that I should be killed?\"\n\n\"Ow!\" chuckled the obese old ruffian; \"cannot you with all your\ncleverness guess that, O Macumazahn? Perhaps it is he who needs the tall\nwhite maiden, and not I. Perhaps if he does certain things for me, I\nhave promised her to him in payment. And perhaps,\" he added, laughing\nquite loud, \"I shall trick him after all, keeping her for myself,\nand paying him in another way, for can a cheat grumble if he is\nout-cheated?\"\n\nI answered that I was an honest man, and knew nothing about cheats, or\nat what they could or could not grumble.\n\n\"Yes, Macumazahn,\" replied Dingaan quite genially. \"That is where\nyou and I are alike. We are both honest, quite honest, and therefore\nfriends, which I can never be with these Amaboona, who, as you and\nothers have told me, are traitors. We play our game in the light, like\nmen, and who wins, wins, and who loses, loses. Now hear me, Macumazahn,\nand remember what I say. Whatever happens to others, whatever you may\nsee, you are safe while I live. Dingaan has spoken. Whether I get the\ntall white girl, or do not get her, still _you_ are safe; it is on my\nhead,\" and he touched the gum-ring in his hair.\n\n\"And why should I be safe if others are unsafe, O king?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh! if you would know that, ask a certain ancient prophet named Zikali,\nwho was in this land in the days of Senzangacona, my father, and before\nthen--that is, if you can find him. Also, I like you, who are not a\nflat-faced fool like these Amaboona, but have a brain that turns in and\nout through difficulties, as a snake does through reeds; and it would\nbe a pity to kill one who can shoot birds wheeling high above him in\nthe air, which no one else can do. So whatever you see and whatever you\nhear, remember that you are safe, and shall go safely from this land, or\nstay safely in it if you will, to be my voice to speak with the Sons of\nGeorge.\n\n\"Now return to the commandant, and say to him that my heart is his\nheart, and that I am very pleased to see him here. To-morrow, and\nperhaps the next day, I will show him some of the dances of my people,\nand after that I will sign the writing, giving him all the land he asks\nand everything else he may desire, more than he can wish, indeed. Hamba\ngachl\u00e9, Macumazahn,\" and, rising with surprising quickness from his\nchair, which was cut out of a single block of wood, he turned and\nvanished through the little opening in the reed fence behind him that\nled to his private huts.\n\nAs I was being conducted back to the Boer camp by Kambula, who was\nwaiting for me outside the gate of the labyrinth which is called\nisiklohlo, I met Thomas Halstead, who was lounging about, I think in\norder to speak with me. Halting, I asked him straight out what the\nking's intentions were towards the Boers.\n\n\"Don't know,\" he answered, shrugging his shoulders, \"but he seems so\nsweet on them that I think he must be up to mischief. He is wonderfully\nfond of you, too, for I heard him give orders that the word was to be\npassed through all the regiments that if anyone so much as hurt you,\nhe should be killed at once. Also, you were pointed out to the soldiers\nwhen you rode in with the rest, that they might all of them know you.\"\n\n\"That's good for me as far as it goes,\" I replied. \"But I don't know why\nI should need special protection above others, unless there is someone\nwho wants to harm me.\"\n\n\"There is that, Allan Quatermain. The indunas tell me that the\ngood-looking Portugee, whom they call 'Two-faces,' asks the king to kill\nyou every time he sees him. Indeed, I've heard him myself.\"\n\n\"That's kind of him,\" I answered, \"but, then, Hernan Pereira and I\nnever got on. Tell me what is he talking about to the king when he isn't\nasking him to kill me.\"\n\n\"Don't know,\" he said again. \"Something dirty, I'll be bound. One may be\nsure of that by the native name they have given him. I think, however,\"\nhe added in a whisper, \"that he has had a lot to do with the Boers being\nallowed to come here at all in order to get their treaty signed. At\nleast, one day when I was interpreting and Dingaan swore that he would\nnot give them more land than was enough to bury them in, Pereira told\nhim that it didn't matter what he signed, as 'what was written with the\npen could be scratched out with the spear.'\"\n\n\"Indeed! And what did the king say to that?\"\n\n\"Oh! he laughed and said it was true, and that he would give the Boer\ncommission all their people wanted and something over for themselves.\nBut don't you repeat that, Quatermain, for if you do, and it gets to the\near of Dingaan, I shall certainly be killed. And, I say, you're a good\nfellow, and I won a big bet on you over that vulture shooting, so I will\ngive you a bit of advice, which you will be wise to take. You get out of\nthis country as soon as you can, and go to look after that pretty Miss\nMarais, whom you are sweet on. Dingaan wants her, and what Dingaan wants\nhe gets in this part of the world.\"\n\nThen, without waiting to be thanked, he turned and disappeared among\na crowd of Zulus, who were following us from curiosity, leaving me\nwondering whether or no Dingaan was right when he called this young man\na liar. His story seemed to tally so well with that told by the king\nhimself, that on the whole I thought he was not.\n\nJust after I had passed the main gateway of the great town, where, his\noffice done, Kambula saluted and left me, I saw two white men engaged in\nearnest conversation beneath one of the milk trees which, as I think I\nhave already mentioned, grow, or grew, there. They were Henri Marais\nand his nephew. Catching sight of me, Marais walked off, but Pereira\nadvanced and spoke to me, although, warned perhaps by what had happened\nto him in the case of Retief, I am glad to say he did not offer me his\nhand.\n\n\"Good day to you, Allan,\" he said effusively. \"I have just heard from my\nuncle that I have to congratulate you, about Marie I mean, and, believe\nme, I do so with all my heart.\"\n\nNow, as he spoke these words, remembering what I had just heard,\nmy blood boiled in me, but I thought it wise to control myself, and\ntherefore only answered:\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" he went on, \"we have both striven for this prize, but as\nit has pleased God that you should win it, why, I am not one to bear\nmalice.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear it,\" I replied. \"I thought that perhaps you might be.\nNow tell me, to change the subject, how long will Dingaan keep us here?\"\n\n\"Oh! two or three days at most. You see, Allan, luckily I have been\nable to persuade him to sign the treaty about the land without further\ntrouble. So as soon as that is done, you can all go home.\"\n\n\"The commandant will be very grateful to you,\" I said. \"But what are you\ngoing to do?\"\n\n\"I do not know, Allan. You see, I am not a lucky fellow like yourself\nwith a wife waiting for me. I think that perhaps I shall stop here a\nwhile. I see a way of making a great deal of money out of these Zulus;\nand having lost everything upon that Delagoa Bay trek, I want money.\"\n\n\"We all do,\" I answered, \"especially if we are starting in life. So when\nit is convenient to you to settle your debts I shall be glad.\"\n\n\"Oh! have no fear,\" he exclaimed with a sudden lighting up of his dark\nface, \"I will pay you what I owe you, every farthing, with good interest\nthrown in.\"\n\n\"The king has just told me that is your intention,\" I remarked quietly,\nlooking him full in the eyes. Then I walked on, leaving him staring\nafter me, apparently without a word to say.\n\nI went straight to the hut that was allotted to Retief in the little\noutlying guard-kraal, which had been given to us for a camp. Here I\nfound the commandant seated on a Kaffir stool engaged in painfully\nwriting a letter, using a bit of board placed on his knees as a desk.\n\nHe looked up, and asked me how I had got on with Dingaan, not being\nsorry, as I think, of an excuse to pause in his clerical labours.\n\n\"Listen, commandant,\" I said, and, speaking in a low voice, so as not to\nbe overheard, I told him every word that had passed in the interviews I\nhad just had with Dingaan, with Thomas Halstead, and with Pereira.\n\nHe heard me out in silence, then said:\n\n\"This is a strange and ugly story, Allan, and if it is true, Pereira\nmust be an even bigger scoundrel than I thought him. But I can't believe\nthat it is true. I think that Dingaan has been lying to you for his own\npurposes; I mean about the plot to kill you.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, commandant. I don't know, and I don't much care. But I am sure\nthat he was not lying when he said he meant to steal away my wife either\nfor himself or for Pereira.\"\n\n\"What, then, do you intend to do, Allan?\"\n\n\"I intend, commandant, with your permission to send Hans, my\nafter-rider, back to the camp with a letter for Marie, telling her to\nremove herself quietly to the farm I have chosen down on the river, of\nwhich I told you, and there to lie hid till I come back.\"\n\n\"I think it needless, Allan. Still, if it will ease your mind, do so,\nsince I cannot spare you to go yourself. Only you must not send this\nHottentot, who would talk and frighten the people. I am despatching\na messenger to the camp to tell them of our safe arrival and good\nreception by Dingaan. He can take your letter, in which I order you to\nsay to your wife that if she and the Prinsloos and the Meyers go to\nthis farm of yours, they are to go without talking, just as though they\nwanted a change, that is all. Have the letter ready by dawn to-morrow\nmorning, as I trust mine may be,\" he added with a groan.\n\n\"It shall be ready, commandant; but what about Hernan Pereira and his\ntricks?\"\n\n\"This about the accursed Hernan Pereira,\" exclaimed Retief, striking\nthe writing-board with his fist. \"On the first opportunity I will myself\ntake the evidence of Dingaan and of the English lad, Halstead. If I find\nthey tell me the same story they have told you, I will put Pereira on\nhis trial, as I threatened to do before; and should he be found guilty,\nby God! I will have him shot. But for the present it is best to do\nnothing, except keep an eye on him, lest we should cause fear and\nscandal in the camp, and, after all, not prove the case. Now go and\nwrite your letter, and leave me to write mine.\"\n\nSo I went and wrote, telling Marie something, but by no means all of\nthat I have set down. I bade her, and the Prinsloos and the Meyers, if\nthey would accompany her, as I was sure they would, move themselves\noff at once to the farm I had beaconed out thirty miles away from the\nBushman's River, under pretence of seeing how the houses that were being\nbuilt there were getting on. Or if they would not go, I bade her go\nalone with a few Hottentot servants, or any other companions she could\nfind.\n\nThis letter I took to Retief, and read it to him. At my request, also,\nhe scrawled at the foot of it:\n\n\n\"I have seen the above and approve it, knowing all the story, which may\nbe true or false. Do as your husband bids you, but do not talk of it in\nthe camp except to those whom he mentions.--PIETER RETIEF.\"\n\n\nSo the messenger departed at dawn, and in due course delivered my letter\nto Marie.\n\nThe next day was Sunday. In the morning I went to call upon the Reverend\nMr. Owen, the missionary, who was very glad to see me. He informed me\nthat Dingaan was in good mind towards us, and had been asking him if he\nwould write the treaty ceding the land which the Boers wanted. I stopped\nfor service at the huts of Mr. Owen, and then returned to the camp. In\nthe afternoon Dingaan celebrated a great war dance for us to witness, in\nwhich about twelve thousand soldiers took part.\n\nIt was a wonderful and awe-inspiring spectacle, and I remember that each\nof the regiments employed had a number of trained oxen which manoeuvred\nwith them, apparently at given words of command. We did not see Dingaan\nthat day, except at a distance, and after the dance was over returned to\nour camp to eat the beef which he had provided for us in plenty.\n\nOn the third day--that was Monday, the 5th of February, there were more\ndancings and sham fights, so many more, indeed, that we began to weary\nof this savage show. Late in the afternoon, however, Dingaan sent for\nthe commandant and his men to come to see him, saying that he wished to\ntalk with him about the matter of the treaty. So we went; but only three\nor four, of whom I was one, were admitted to Dingaan's presence, the\nrest remaining at a little distance, where they could see us but were\nout of earshot.\n\nDingaan then produced a paper which had been written by the Reverend\nMr. Owen. This document, which I believe still exists, for it was found\nafterwards, was drawn up in legal or semi-legal form, beginning like a\nproclamation, \"Know all men.\"\n\nIt ceded \"the place called Port Natal, together with all the land\nannexed--that is to say, from Tugela to the Umzimvubu River westward,\nand from the sea to the north\"--to the Boers, \"for their everlasting\nproperty.\" At the king's request, as the deed was written in English\nby Mr. Owen, I translated it to him, and afterwards the lad Halstead\ntranslated it also, being called in to do so when I had finished.\n\nThis was done that my rendering might be checked, and the fact impressed\nall the Boers very favourably. It showed them that the king desired to\nunderstand exactly what he was to sign, which would not have been the\ncase had he intended any trick or proposed to cheat them afterwards.\nFrom that moment forward Retief and his people had no further doubts\nas to Dingaan's good faith in this matter, and foolishly relaxed all\nprecautions against treachery.\n\nWhen the translating was finished, the commandant asked the king if he\nwould sign the paper then and there. He answered, \"No; he would sign it\non the following morning, before the commission returned to Natal.\"\nIt was then that Retief inquired of Dingaan, through Thomas Halstead,\nwhether it was a true story which he had heard, that the Boer called\nPereira, who had been staying with him, and whom the Zulus knew by the\nname of \"Two-faces,\" had again asked him, Dingaan, to have me, Allan\nQuatermain, whom they called Macumazahn, killed. Dingaan laughed and\nanswered:\n\n\"Yes, that is true enough, for he hates this Macumazahn. But let the\nlittle white Son of George have no fear, since my heart is soft towards\nhim, and I swear by the head of the Black One that he shall come to no\nharm in Zululand. Is he not my guest, as you are?\"\n\nHe then went on to say that if the commandant wished it, he would have\n\"Two-faces\" seized and killed because he had dared to ask for my life.\nRetief answered that he would look into that matter himself, and after\nThomas Halstead had confirmed the king's story as to Pereira's conduct,\nhe rose and said good-bye to Dingaan.\n\nOf this matter of Hernan Pereira, Retief said little as we went back to\nthe camp outside the Kraal, though the little that he did say showed his\ndeep anger. When we arrived at the camp, however, he sent for Pereira\nand Marais and several of the older Boers. I remember that among these\nwere Gerrit Bothma, Senior, Hendrik Labuschagne and Matthys Pretorius,\nSenior, all of them persons of standing and judgment. I also was ordered\nto be present. When Pereira arrived, Retief charged him openly with\nhaving plotted my murder, and asked him what he had to say. Of course,\nhis answer was a flat denial, and an accusation against me of having\ninvented the tale because we had been at enmity over a maiden whom I had\nsince married.\n\n\"Then, Mynheer Pereira,\" said Retief, \"as Allan Quatermain here has won\nthe maiden who is now his wife, it would seem that his cause of enmity\nmust have ceased, whereas yours may well have remained. However, I have\nno time to try cases of the sort now. But I warn you that this one will\nbe looked into later on when we get back to Natal, whither I shall take\nyou with me, and that meanwhile an eye is kept on you and what you do.\nAlso I warn you that I have evidence for all that I say. Now be so good\nas to go, and to keep out of my sight as much as possible, for I do not\nlike a man whom these Kaffirs name 'Two-faces.' As for you, friend Henri\nMarais, I tell you that you would do well to associate yourself less\nwith one whose name is under so dark a cloud, although he may be your\nown nephew, whom all know you love blindly.\"\n\nSo far as I recollect neither of them made any answer to this direct\nspeech. They simply turned and went away. But on the next morning, that\nof the fatal 6th of February, when I chanced to meet the Commandant\nRetief as he was riding through the camp making arrangements for our\ndeparture to Natal, he pulled up his horse and said:\n\n\"Allan, Hernan Pereira has gone, and Henri Marais with him, and for my\npart I am not sorry, for doubtless we shall meet again, in this world or\nthe next, and find out all the truth. Here, read this, and give it back\nto me afterwards\"; and he threw me a paper and rode on.\n\nI opened the folded sheet and read as follows:\n\n\n\"To the Commandant Retief, Governor of the Emigrant Boers,\n\n\"Mynheer Commandant,\n\n\"I will not stay here, where such foul accusations are laid on me by\nblack Kaffirs and the Englishman, Allan Quatermain, who, like all his\nrace, is an enemy of us Boers, and, although you do not know it, a\ntraitor who is plotting great harm against you with the Zulus. Therefore\nI leave you, but am ready to meet every charge at the right time before\na proper Court. My uncle, Henri Marais, comes with me, as he feels that\nhis honour is also touched. Moreover, he has heard that his daughter,\nMarie, is in danger from the Zulus, and returns to protect her, which\nhe who is called her husband neglects to do. Allan Quatermain, the\nEnglishman, who is the friend of Dingaan, can explain what I mean,\nfor he knows more about the Zulu plans than I do, as you will find out\nbefore the end.\"\n\nThen followed the signatures of Hernan Pereira and Henri Marais.\n\nI put the letter in my pocket, wondering what might be its precise\nmeaning, and in particular that of the absurd and undefined charge\nof treachery against myself. It seemed to me that Pereira had left us\nbecause he was afraid of something--either that he might be placed upon\nhis trial or of some ultimate catastrophe in which he would be involved.\nMarais probably had gone with him for the same reason that a bit of iron\nfollows a magnet, because he never could resist the attraction of this\nevil man, his relative by birth. Or perhaps he had learned from him\nthe story of his daughter's danger, upon which I had already acted, and\nreally was anxious about her safety. For it must always be remembered\nthat Marais loved Marie passionately, however ill the reader of this\nhistory may think that he behaved to her. She was his darling, the apple\nof his eye, and her great offence in his sight was that she cared for me\nmore than she did for him. That is one of the reasons why he hated me as\nmuch as he loved her.\n\nAlmost before I had finished reading this letter, the order came that we\nwere to go in a body to bid farewell to Dingaan, leaving our arms\npiled beneath the two milk trees at the gate of the town. Most of our\nafter-riders were commanded to accompany us--I think because Retief\nwished to make as big a show as possible to impress the Zulus. A few\nof these Hottentots, however, were told to stay behind that they might\ncollect the horses, that were knee-haltered and grazing at a distance,\nand saddle them up. Among these was Hans, for, as it chanced, I saw and\nsent him with the others, so that I might be sure that my own horses\nwould be found and made ready for the journey.\n\nJust as we were starting, I met the lad William Wood, who had come down\nfrom the Mission huts, where he lived with Mr. Owen, and was wandering\nabout with an anxious face.\n\n\"How are you, William?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not very well, Mr. Quatermain,\" he answered. \"The fact is,\" he added\nwith a burst of confidence, \"I feel queerly about you all. The Kaffirs\nhave told me that something is going to happen to you, and I think you\nought to know it. I daren't say any more,\" and he vanished into the\ncrowd.\n\nAt that moment I caught sight of Retief riding to and fro and shouting\nout orders. Going to him, I caught him by the sleeve, saying:\n\n\"Commandant, listen to me.\"\n\n\"Well, what is it now, nephew?\" he asked absently.\n\nI told him what Wood had said, adding that I also was uneasy; I did not\nknow why.\n\n\"Oh!\" he answered with impatience, \"this is all hailstones and burnt\ngrass\" (meaning that the one would melt and the other blow away, or in\nour English idiom, stuff and rubbish). \"Why are you always trying to\nscare me with your fancies, Allan? Dingaan is our friend, not our enemy.\nSo let us take the gifts that fortune gives us and be thankful. Come,\nmarch.\"\n\nThis he said about eight o'clock in the morning.\n\nWe strolled through the gates of the Great Kraal, most of the Boers,\nwho, as usual, had piled their arms under the two milk trees, lounging\nalong in knots of four or five, laughing and chatting as they went. I\nhave often thought since, that although every one of them there, except\nmyself, was doomed within an hour to have taken the dreadful step from\ntime into eternity, it seems strange that advancing fate should have\nthrown no shadow on their hearts. On the contrary, they were quite gay,\nbeing extremely pleased at the successful issue of their mission and the\nprospect of an immediate return to their wives and children. Even Retief\nwas gay, for I heard him joking with his companions about myself and my\n\"white-bread-week,\" or honeymoon, which, he said, was drawing very near.\n\nAs we went, I noticed that most of the regiments who had performed the\ngreat military dances before us on the previous day were gone. Two,\nhowever, remained--the Ischlangu Inhlope, that is the \"White Shields,\"\nwho were a corps of veterans wearing the ring on their heads, and the\nIschlangu Umnyama, that is the \"Black Shields,\" who were all of them\nyoung men without rings. The \"White Shields\" were ranged along the\nfence of the great open place to our left, and the \"Black Shields\" were\nsimilarly placed to our right, each regiment numbering about fifteen\nhundred men. Except for their kerries and dancing-sticks they were\nunarmed.\n\nPresently we reached the head of the dancing ground, and found Dingaan\nseated in his chair with two of his great indunas, Umhlela and Tambusa,\nsquatting on either side of him. Behind him, standing in and about the\nentrance to the labyrinth through which the king had come, were other\nindunas and captains. On arriving in front of Dingaan we saluted him,\nand he acknowledged the salutation with pleasant words and smiles. Then\nRetief, two or three of the other Boers, Thomas Halstead and I went\nforward, whereon the treaty was produced again and identified as the\nsame document that we had seen on the previous day.\n\nAt the foot of it someone--I forget who--wrote in Dutch, \"De merk van\nKoning Dingaan\" [that is, The mark of King Dingaan.] In the space left\nbetween the words \"merk\" and \"van\" Dingaan made a cross with a pen that\nwas given to him, Thomas Halstead holding his hand and showing him what\nto do.\n\nAfter this, three of his indunas, or great councillors, who were named\nNwara, Yuliwana and Manondo, testified as witnesses for the Zulus, and\nM. Oosthuyzen, A. C. Greyling and B. J. Liebenberg, who were standing\nnearest to Retief, as witnesses for the Boers.\n\nThis done, Dingaan ordered one of his isibongos, or praisers, to run\nto and fro in front of the regiments and others there assembled, and\nproclaim that he had granted Natal to the Boers to be their property\nfor ever, information which the Zulus received with shouts. Then Dingaan\nasked Retief if he would not eat, and large trenchers of boiled beef\nwere brought out and handed round. This, however, the Boers refused,\nsaying they had already breakfasted. Thereon the king said that at least\nthey must drink, and pots of twala, or Kaffir beer, were handed round,\nof which all the Boers partook.\n\nWhile they were drinking, Dingaan gave Retief a message to the Dutch\nfarmers, to the effect that he hoped they would soon come and occupy\nNatal, which henceforth was their country. Also, black-hearted villain\nthat he was, that they would have a pleasant journey home. Next he\nordered the two regiments to dance and sing war songs, in order to amuse\nhis guests.\n\nThis they began to do, drawing nearer as they danced.\n\nIt was at this moment that a Zulu appeared, pushing his way through the\ncaptains who were gathered at the gate of the labyrinth, and delivered\nsome message to one of the indunas, who in turn passed it on to the\nking.\n\n\"Ow! is it so?\" said the king with a troubled look. Then his glance fell\non me as though by accident, and he added: \"Macumazahn, one of my wives\nis taken very ill suddenly, and says she must have some of the medicine\nof the white men before they go away. Now, you tell me that you are a\nnew-married man, so I can trust you with my wives. I pray you to go\nand find out what medicine it is that she needs, for you can speak our\ntongue.\"\n\nI hesitated, then translated what he had said to Retief.\n\n\"You had best go, nephew,\" said the commandant; \"but come back quickly,\nfor we ride at once.\"\n\nStill I hesitated, not liking this business; whereon the king began to\ngrow angry.\n\n\"What!\" he said, \"do you white men refuse me this little favour, when I\nhave just given you so much--you who have wonderful medicines that can\ncure the sick?\"\n\n\"Go, Allan, go,\" said Retief, when he understood his words, \"or he will\ngrow cross and everything may be undone.\"\n\nSo, having no choice, I went through the gateway into the labyrinth.\n\nNext moment men pounced on me, and before I could utter a word a cloth\nwas thrown over my mouth and tied tight behind my head.\n\nI was a prisoner and gagged.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. DEPART IN PEACE\n\n\nA tall Kaffir, one of the king's household guards, who carried an\nassegai, came up to me and whispered:\n\n\"Hearken, little Son of George. The king would save you, if he can,\nbecause you are not Dutch, but English. Yet, know that if you try to cry\nout, if you even struggle, you die,\" and he lifted the assegai so as to\nbe ready to plunge it through my heart.\n\nNow I understood, and a cold sweat broke out all over me. My companions\nwere to be murdered, every one! Oh! gladly would I have given my life\nto warn them. But alas! I could not, for the cloth upon my mouth was so\nthick that no sound could pass it.\n\nOne of the Zulus inserted a stick between the reeds of the fence.\nWorking it to and fro sideways, he made an opening just in a line with\nmy eyes--out of cruelty, I suppose, for now I must see everything.\n\nFor some time--ten minutes, I dare say--the dancing and beer-drinking\nwent on. Then Dingaan rose from his chair and shook the hand of Retief\nwarmly, bidding him \"Hamba gachl\u00e9,\" that is, Depart gently, or in peace.\nHe retreated towards the gate of the labyrinth, and as he went the Boers\ntook off their hats, waving them in the air and cheering him. He was\nalmost through it, and I began to breathe again.\n\nDoubtless I was mistaken. After all, no treachery was intended.\n\nIn the very opening of the gate Dingaan turned, however, and said two\nwords in Zulu which mean:\n\n\"Seize them!\"\n\nInstantly the warriors, who had now danced quite close and were waiting\nfor these words, rushed upon the Boers. I heard Thomas Halstead call out\nin English:\n\n\"We are done for,\" and then add in Zulu, \"Let me speak to the king!\"\n\nDingaan heard also, and waved his hand to show that he refused to\nlisten, and as he did so shouted thrice:\n\n\"Bulala abatagati!\" that is, Slay the wizards!\n\nI saw poor Halstead draw his knife and plunge it into a Zulu who was\nnear him. The man fell, and again he struck at another soldier, cutting\nhis throat. The Boers also drew their knives--those of them who had\ntime--and tried to defend themselves against these black devils, who\nrushed on them in swarms. I heard afterwards that they succeeded in\nkilling six or eight of them and wounding perhaps a score. But it was\nsoon over, for what could men armed only with pocket-knives do against\nsuch a multitude?\n\nPresently, amidst a hideous tumult of shouts, groans, curses, prayers\nfor mercy, and Zulu battle cries, the Boers were all struck down--yes,\neven the two little lads and the Hottentot servants. Then they were\ndragged away, still living, by the soldiers, their heels trailing on the\nground, just as wounded worms or insects are dragged by the black ants.\n\nDingaan was standing by me now, laughing, his fat face working\nnervously.\n\n\"Come, Son of George,\" he said, \"and let us see the end of these\ntraitors to your sovereign.\"\n\nThen I was pulled along to an eminence within the labyrinth, whence\nthere was a view of the surrounding country. Here we waited a little\nwhile, listening to the tumult that grew more distant, till presently\nthe dreadful procession of death reappeared, coming round the fence of\nthe Great Kraal and heading straight for the Hill of Slaughter, Hloma\nAmabutu. Soon its slopes were climbed, and there among the dark-leaved\nbushes and the rocks the black soldiers butchered them, every one.\n\nI saw and swooned away.\n\n\nI believe that I remained senseless for many hours, though towards the\nend of that time my swoon grew thin, as it were, and I heard a hollow\nvoice speaking over me in Zulu.\n\n\"I am glad that the little Son of George has been saved,\" said the\nechoing voice, which I did not know, \"for he has a great destiny and\nwill be useful to the black people in time to come.\" Then the voice went\non:\n\n\"O House of Senzangacona! now you have mixed your milk with blood, with\nwhite blood. Of that bowl you shall drink to the dregs, and afterwards\nmust the bowl be shattered\"; and the speaker laughed--a deep, dreadful\nlaugh that I was not to hear again for years.\n\nI heard him go away, shuffling along like some great reptile, and then,\nwith an effort, opened my eyes. I was in a large hut, and the only light\nin the hut came from a fire that burned in its centre, for it was night\ntime. A Zulu woman, young and good-looking, was bending over a\ngourd near the fire, doing something to its contents. I spoke to her\nlight-headedly.\n\n\"O woman,\" I said, \"is that a man who laughed over me?\"\n\n\"Not altogether, Macumazahn,\" she answered in a pleasant voice. \"That\nwas Zikali, the Mighty Magician, the Counsellor of Kings, the Opener of\nRoads; he whose birth our grandfathers do not remember; he whose breath\ncauses the trees to be torn out by the roots; he whom Dingaan fears and\nobeys.\"\n\n\"Did he cause the Boers to be killed?\" I asked.\n\n\"Mayhap,\" she answered. \"Who am I that I should know of such matters?\"\n\n\"Are you the woman who was sick whom I was sent to visit?\" I asked\nagain.\n\n\"Yes, Macumazahn, I was sick, but now I am well and you are sick, for so\nthings go round. Drink this,\" and she handed me a gourd of milk.\n\n\"How are you named?\" I inquired as I took it.\n\n\"Naya is my name,\" she replied, \"and I am your jailer. Don't think\nthat you can escape me, though, Macumazahn, for there are other jailers\nwithout who carry spears. Drink.\"\n\nSo I drank and bethought me that the draught might be poisoned. Yet so\nthirsty was I that I finished it, every drop.\n\n\"Now am I a dead man?\" I asked, as I put down the gourd.\n\n\"No, no, Macumazahn,\" she who called herself Naya replied in a soft\nvoice; \"not a dead man, only one who will sleep and forget.\"\n\nThen I lost count of everything and slept--for how long I know not.\n\nWhen I awoke again it was broad daylight; in fact, the sun stood high in\nthe heavens. Perhaps Naya had put some drug into my milk, or perhaps I\nhad simply slept. I do not know. At any rate, I was grateful for that\nsleep, for without it I think that I should have gone mad. As it was,\nwhen I remembered, which it took me some time to do, for a while I went\nnear to insanity.\n\nI recollect lying there in that hut and wondering how the Almighty\ncould have permitted such a deed as I had seen done. How could it be\nreconciled with any theory of a loving and merciful Father? Those poor\nBoers, whatever their faults, and they had many, like the rest of us,\nwere in the main good and honest men according to their lights. Yet they\nhad been doomed to be thus brutally butchered at the nod of a savage\ndespot, their wives widowed, their children left fatherless, or, as it\nproved in the end, in most cases murdered or orphaned!\n\nThe mystery was too great--great enough to throw off its balance the\nmind of a young man who had witnessed such a fearsome scene as I have\ndescribed.\n\nFor some days really I think that my reason hung just upon the edge of\nthat mental precipice. In the end, however, reflection and education,\nof which I had a certain amount, thanks to my father, came to my aid. I\nrecalled that such massacres, often on an infinitely larger scale,\nhad happened a thousand times in history, and that still through them,\noften, indeed, by means of them, civilisation has marched forward, and\nmercy and peace have kissed each other over the bloody graves of the\nvictims.\n\nTherefore even in my youth and inexperience I concluded that some\nineffable purpose was at work through this horror, and that the lives\nof those poor men which had been thus sacrificed were necessary to that\npurpose. This may appear a dreadful and fatalistic doctrine, but it\nis one that is corroborated in Nature every day, and doubtless the\nsufferers meet with their compensations in some other state. Indeed, if\nit be not so, faith and all the religions are vain.\n\nOr, of course, it may chance that such monstrous calamities happen, not\nthrough the will of the merciful Power of which I have spoken, but in\nits despite. Perhaps the devil of Scripture, at whom we are inclined to\nsmile, is still very real and active in this world of ours. Perhaps from\ntime to time some evil principle breaks into eruption, like the prisoned\nforces of a volcano, bearing death and misery on its wings, until in the\nend it must depart strengthless and overcome. Who can say?\n\nThe question is one that should be referred to the Archbishop of\nCanterbury and the Pope of Rome in conclave, with the Lama of Thibet for\numpire in case they disagreed. I only try to put down the thoughts that\nstruck me so long ago as my mind renders them to-day. But very likely\nthey are not quite the same thoughts, for a full generation has gone by\nme since then, and in that time the intelligence ripens as wine does in\na bottle.\n\nBesides these general matters, I had questions of my own to consider\nduring those days of imprisonment--for instance, that of my own safety,\nthough of this, to be honest, I thought little. If I were going to be\nkilled, I was going to be killed, and there was an end. But my knowledge\nof Dingaan told me that he had not massacred Retief and his companions\nfor nothing. This would be but the prelude to a larger slaughter, for I\nhad not forgotten what he said as to the sparing of Marie and the other\nhints he gave me.\n\nFrom all this I concluded, quite rightly as it proved, that some general\nonslaught was being made upon the Boers, who probably would be swept out\nto the last man. And to think that here I was, a prisoner in a Kaffir\nkraal, with only a young woman as a jailer, and yet utterly unable to\nescape to warn them. For round my hut lay a courtyard, and round it\nagain ran a reed fence about five feet six inches high. Whenever I\nlooked over this fence, by night or by day, I saw soldiers stationed at\nintervals of about fifteen yards. There they stood like statues, their\nbroad spears in their hands, all looking inwards towards the fence.\nThere they stood--only at night their number was doubled. Clearly it was\nnot meant that I should escape.\n\nA week went by thus--believe me, a very terrible week. During that time\nmy sole companion was the pretty young woman, Naya. We became friends\nin a way and talked on a variety of subjects. Only, at the end of our\nconversations I always found that I had gained no information whatsoever\nabout any matter of immediate interest. On such points as the history of\nthe Zulu and kindred tribes, or the character of Chaka, the great king,\nor anything else that was remote she would discourse by the hour. But\nwhen we came to current events, she dried up like water on a red-hot\nbrick. Still, Naya grew, or pretended to grow, quite attached to me. She\neven suggested na\u00efvely that I might do worse than marry her, which she\nsaid Dingaan was quite ready to allow, as he was fond of me and thought\nI should be useful in his country. When I told her that I was already\nmarried, she shrugged her shining shoulders and asked with a laugh that\nrevealed her beautiful teeth:\n\n\"What does that matter? Cannot a man have more wives than one? And,\nMacumazahn,\" she added, leaning forward and looking at me, \"how do you\nknow that you have even one? You may be divorced or a widower by now.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked.\n\n\"I? I mean nothing; do not look at me so fiercely, Macumazahn. Surely\nsuch things happen in the world, do they not?\"\n\n\"Naya,\" I said, \"you are two bad things--a bait and a spy--and you know\nit.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I do, Macumazahn,\" she answered. \"Am I to blame for that, if my\nlife is on it, especially when I really like you for yourself?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" I said. \"Tell me, when am I going to get out of this\nplace?\"\n\n\"How can I tell you, Macumazahn?\" Naya replied, patting my hand in her\ngenial way, \"but I think before long. When you are gone, Macumazahn,\nremember me kindly sometimes, as I have really tried to make you as\ncomfortable as I could with a watcher staring through every straw in the\nhut.\"\n\nI said whatever seemed to be appropriate, and next morning my\ndeliverance came. While I was eating my breakfast in the courtyard at\nthe back of the hut, Naya thrust her handsome and pleasant face round\nthe corner and said that there was a messenger to see me from the king.\nLeaving the rest of the meal unswallowed, I went to the doorway of the\nyard and there found my old friend, Kambula.\n\n\"Greeting, Inkoos,\" he said to me; \"I am come to take you back to Natal\nwith a guard. But I warn you to ask me no questions, for if you do I\nmust not answer them. Dingaan is ill, and you cannot see him, nor can\nyou see the white praying-man, or anyone; you must come with me at\nonce.\"\n\n\"I do not want to see Dingaan,\" I replied, looking him in the eyes.\n\n\"I understand,\" answered Kambula; \"Dingaan's thoughts are his thoughts\nand your thoughts are your thoughts, and perhaps that is why he does not\nwant to see _you_. Still, remember, Inkoos, that Dingaan has saved your\nlife, snatching you unburned out of a very great fire, perhaps because\nyou are of a different sort of wood, which he thinks it a pity to burn.\nNow, if you are ready, let us go.\"\n\n\"I am ready,\" I answered.\n\nAt the gate I met Naya, who said:\n\n\"You never thought to say good-bye to me, White Man, although I have\ntended you well. Ah! what else could I expect? Still, I hope that if I\nshould have to fly from this land for _my_ life, as may chance, you will\ndo for me what I have done for you.\"\n\n\"That I will,\" I answered, shaking her by the hand; and, as it happened,\nin after years I did.\n\nKambula led me, not through the kraal Umgungundhlovu, but round it.\nOur road lay immediately past the death mount, Hloma Amabutu, where the\nvultures were still gathered in great numbers. Indeed, it was actually\nmy lot to walk over the new-picked bones of some of my companions who\nhad been despatched at the foot of the hill. One of these skeletons I\nrecognised by his clothes to be that of Samuel Esterhuizen, a very\ngood fellow, at whose side I had slept during all our march. His empty\neye-sockets seemed to stare at me reproachfully, as though they asked\nme why I remained alive when he and all his brethren were dead. I echoed\nthe question in my own mind. Why of that great company did I alone\nremain alive?\n\nAn answer seemed to rise within me: That I might be one of the\ninstruments of vengeance upon that devilish murderer, Dingaan. Looking\nupon those poor shattered and desecrated frames that had been men, I\nswore in my heart that if I lived I would not fail in that mission. Nor\ndid I fail, although the history of that great repayment cannot be told\nin these pages.\n\nTurning my eyes from this dreadful sight, I saw that on the opposite\nslope, where we had camped during our southern trek from Delagoa, still\nstood the huts and wagons of the Reverend Mr. Owen. I asked Kambula\nwhether he and his people were also dead.\n\n\"No, Inkoos,\" he answered; \"they are of the Children of George, as you\nare, and therefore the king has spared them, although he is going to\nsend them out of the country.\"\n\nThis was good news, so far as it went, and I asked again if Thomas\nHalstead had also been spared, since he, too, was an Englishman.\n\n\"No,\" said Kambula. \"The king wished to save him, but he killed two of\nour people and was dragged off with the rest. When the slayers got to\ntheir work it was too late to stay their hands.\"\n\nAgain I asked whether I might not join Mr. Owen and trek with him, to\nwhich Kambula answered briefly:\n\n\"No, Macumazahn; the king's orders are that you must go by yourself.\"\n\nSo I went; nor did I ever again meet Mr. Owen or any of his people. I\nbelieve, however, that they reached Durban safely and sailed away in a\nship called the Comet.\n\nIn a little while we came to the two milk trees by the main gate of the\nkraal, where much of our saddlery still lay scattered about, though the\nguns had gone. Here Kambula asked me if I could recognise my own saddle.\n\n\"There it is,\" I answered, pointing to it; \"but what is the use of a\nsaddle without a horse?\"\n\n\"The horse you rode has been kept for you, Macumazahn,\" he replied.\n\nThen he ordered one of the men with us to bring the saddle and bridle,\nalso some other articles which I selected, such as a couple of blankets,\na water-bottle, two tins containing coffee and sugar, a little case of\nmedicines, and so forth.\n\nAbout a mile further on I found one of my horses tethered by an outlying\nguard hut, and noted that it had been well fed and cared for. By\nKambula's leave I saddled it and mounted. As I did so, he warned me that\nif I tried to ride away from the escort I should certainly be killed,\nsince even if I escaped them, orders had been given throughout the land\nto put an end to me should I be seen alone.\n\nI replied that, unarmed as I was, I had no idea of making any such\nattempt. So we went forward, Kambula and his soldiers walking or\ntrotting at my side.\n\nFor four full days we journeyed thus, keeping, so far as I could judge,\nabout twenty or thirty miles to the east of that road by which I had\nleft Zululand before and re-entered it with Retief and his commission.\nEvidently I was an object of great interest to the Zulus of the country\nthrough which we passed, perhaps because they knew me to be the sole\nsurvivor of all the white men who had gone up to visit the king. They\nwould come down in crowds from the kraals and stare at me almost with\nawe, as though I were a spirit and not a man. Only, not one of them\nwould say anything to me, probably because they had been forbidden to do\nso. Indeed, if I spoke to any of them, invariably they turned and walked\nor ran out of hearing.\n\nIt was on the evening of the fourth day that Kambula and his soldiers\nreceived some news which seemed to excite them a great deal. A messenger\nin a state of exhaustion, who had an injury to the fleshy part of his\nleft arm, which looked to me as though it had been caused by a bullet,\nappeared out of the bush and said something of which, by straining\nmy ears, I caught two words--\"Great slaughter.\" Then Kambula laid his\nfingers on his lips as a signal for silence and led the man away, nor\ndid I see or hear any more of him. Afterwards I asked Kambula who had\nsuffered this great slaughter, whereon he stared at me innocently and\nreplied that he did not know of what I was speaking.\n\n\"What is the use of lying to me, Kambula, seeing that I shall find out\nthe truth before long?\"\n\n\"Then, Macumazahn, wait till you do find it out, and may it please you,\"\nhe replied, and went off to speak with his people at a distance.\n\nAll that night I heard them talking off and on--I, who lay awake\nplunged into new miseries. I was sure that some other dreadful thing had\nhappened. Probably Dingaan's armies had destroyed all the Boers, and, if\nso, oh! what had become of Marie? Was she dead, or had she perhaps been\ntaken prisoner, as Dingaan had told me would be done for his own vile\npurposes? For aught I knew she might now be travelling under escort to\nUmgungundhlovu, as I was travelling to Natal.\n\nThe morning came at last, and that day, about noon, we reached a ford\nof the Tugela which luckily was quite passable. Here Kambula bade me\nfarewell, saying that his mission was finished. Also he delivered to me\na message that I was to give from Dingaan to the English in Natal. It\nwas to this effect: That he, Dingaan, had killed the Boers who came to\nvisit him because he found out that they were traitors to their chief,\nand therefore not worthy to live. But that he loved the Sons of George,\nwho were true-hearted people, and therefore had nothing to fear from\nhim. Indeed, he begged them to come and see him at his Great Place,\nwhere he would talk matters over with them.\n\nI said that I would deliver the message if I met any English people,\nbut, of course, I could not say whether they would accept Dingaan's\ninvitation to Umgungundhlovu. Indeed, I feared lest that town might\nhave acquired such a bad name that they would prefer not to come there\nwithout an army.\n\nThen, before Kambula had time to take any offence, I shook his\noutstretched hand and urged my horse into the stream. I never met\nKambula again living, though after the battle of Blood River I saw him\ndead.\n\nOnce over the Tugela I rode forward for half a mile or so till I was\nclear of the bush and reeds that grew down to the water, fearing lest\nthe Zulus should follow and take me back to Dingaan to explain my\nrather imprudent message. Seeing no signs of them, I halted, a desolate\ncreature in a desolate country which I did not know, wondering what I\nshould do and whither I should ride. Then it was that there happened one\nof the strangest experiences of all my adventurous life.\n\nAs I sat dejectedly upon my horse, which was also dejected, amidst some\ntumbled rocks that at a distant period in the world's history had formed\nthe bank of the great river, I heard a voice which seemed familiar to me\nsay:\n\n\"Baas, is that _you_, baas?\"\n\nI looked round and could see no one, so, thinking that I had been\ndeceived by my imagination, I held my peace.\n\n\"Baas,\" said the voice again, \"are you dead or are you alive? Because,\nif you are dead, I don't want to have anything to do with spooks until I\nam obliged.\"\n\nNow I answered, \"Who is it that speaks, and whence?\" though, really, as\nI could see no one, I thought that I must be demented.\n\nThe next moment my horse snorted and shied violently, and no wonder, for\nout of a great ant-bear hole not five paces away appeared a yellow face\ncrowned with black wool, in which was set a broken feather. I looked at\nthe face and the face looked at me.\n\n\"Hans,\" I said, \"is it you? I thought that _you_ were killed with the\nothers.\"\n\n\"And I thought that _you_ were killed with the others, baas. Are you\nsure that you are alive?\"\n\n\"What are you doing there, you old fool?\" I asked.\n\n\"Hiding from the Zulus, baas. I heard them on the other bank, and then\nsaw a man on a horse crossing the river, and went to ground like a\njackal. I have had enough of Zulus.\"\n\n\"Come out,\" I said, \"and tell me your story.\"\n\nHe emerged, a thin and bedraggled creature, with nothing left on him but\nthe upper part of a pair of old trousers, but still Hans, undoubtedly\nHans. He ran to me, and seizing my foot, kissed it again and again,\nweeping tears of joy and stuttering:\n\n\"Oh, baas, to think that I should find you who were dead, alive, and\nfind myself alive, too. Oh! baas, never again will I doubt about the Big\nMan in the sky of whom your reverend father is so fond. For after I had\ntried all our own spirits, and even those of my ancestors, and met with\nnothing but trouble, I said the prayer that the reverend taught us,\nasking for my daily bread because I am so very hungry. Then I looked\nout of the hole and there you were. Have you anything to eat about you,\nbaas?\"\n\nAs it chanced, in my saddle-bags I had some biltong that I had saved\nagainst emergencies. I gave it to him, and he devoured it as a famished\nhyena might do, tearing off the tough meat in lumps and bolting them\nwhole. When it was all gone he licked his fingers and his lips and stood\nstill staring at me.\n\n\"Tell me your story,\" I repeated.\n\n\"Baas, I went to fetch the horses with the others, and ours had strayed.\nI got up a tree to look for them. Then I heard a noise, and saw that the\nZulus were killing the Boers; so knowing that presently they would kill\nus, too, I stopped in that tree, hiding myself as well as I could in a\nstork's nest. Well, they came and assegaied all the other Totties, and\nstood under my tree cleaning their spears and getting their breath, for\none of my brothers had given them a good run. But they never saw me,\nalthough I was nearly sick from fear on the top of them. Indeed, I was\nsick, but into the nest.\n\n\"Well, I sat in that nest all day, though the sun cooked me like beef\non a stick; and when night came I got down and ran, for I knew it was\nno good to stop to look for you, and 'every man for himself when a black\ndevil is behind you,' as your reverend father says. All night I ran, and\nin the morning hid up in a hole. Then when night came again I went on\nrunning. Oh! they nearly caught me once or twice, but never quite, for\nI know how to hide, and I kept where men do not go. Only I was hungry,\nhungry; yes, I lived on snails and worms, and grass like an ox, till\nmy middle ached. Still, at last I got across the river and near to the\ncamp.\n\n\"Then just before the day broke and I was saying, 'Now, Hans, although\nyour heart is sad, your stomach will rejoice and sing,' what did I see\nbut those Zulu devils, thousands of them, rush down on the camp and kill\nall the poor Boers. Men and women and the little children, they killed\nthem by the hundred, till at last other Boers came and drove them away,\nalthough they took all the cattle with them. Well, as I was sure that\nthey would come back, I did not stop there. I ran down to the side of\nthe river, and have been crawling about in the reeds for days, living on\nthe eggs of water-birds and a few small fish that I caught in the pools,\ntill this morning, when I heard the Zulus again and slipped up here into\nthis hole. Then you came and stood over the hole, and for a long while I\nthought you were a ghost.\n\n\"But now we are together once more and all is right, just as what your\nreverend father always said it would be with those who go to church on\nSunday, like me when there was nothing else to do.\" And again he fell to\nkissing my foot.\n\n\"Hans,\" I said, \"you saw the camp. Was the Missie Marie there?\"\n\n\"Baas, how can I tell, who never went into it? But the wagon she slept\nin was not there; no, nor that of the Vrouw Prinsloo or of the Heer\nMeyer.\"\n\n\"Thank God!\" I gasped, then added: \"Where were you trying to get to,\nHans, when you ran away from the camp?\"\n\n\"Baas, I thought perhaps that the Missie and the Prinsloos and the\nMeyers had gone to that fine farm which you pegged out, and that I would\ngo and see if they were there. Because if so, I was sure that they would\nbe glad to know that you were really dead, and give me some food in\npayment for my news. But I was afraid to walk across the open veld for\nfear lest the Zulus should see me and kill me. Therefore I came round\nthrough the thick bush along the river, where one can only travel\nslowly, especially if hollow,\" and he patted his wasted stomach.\n\n\"But, Hans,\" I asked, \"are we near my farm where I set the men to build\nthe houses on the hill above the river?\"\n\n\"Of course, baas. Has your brain gone soft that you cannot find your way\nabout the veld? Four, or at most five, hours on horseback, riding slow,\nand you are there.\"\n\n\"Come on, Hans,\" I said, \"and be quick, for I think that the Zulus are\nnot far behind.\"\n\nSo we started, Hans hanging to my stirrup and guiding me, for I knew\nwell enough that although he had never travelled this road, his instinct\nfor locality would not betray a coloured man, who can find his way\nacross the pathless veld as surely as a buck or a bird of the air.\n\nOn we went over the rolling plain, and as we travelled I told him my\nstory, briefly enough, for my mind was too torn with fears to allow me\nto talk much. He, too, told me more of his escape and adventures. Now\nI understood what was that news which had so excited Kambula and his\nsoldiers. It was evident that the Zulu impis had destroyed a great\nnumber of the Boers whom they found unprepared for attack, and then had\nbeen driven off by reinforcements that arrived from other camps.\n\nThat was why I had been kept prisoner for all those days. Dingaan feared\nlest I should reach Natal in time to warn his victims!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. THE COURT-MARTIAL\n\n\nOne hour, two hours, three hours, and then suddenly from the top of a\nrise the sight of the beautiful Mooi River winding through the\nplain like a vast snake of silver, and there, in a loop of it,\nthe flat-crested koppie on which I had hoped to make my home. Had\nhoped!--why should I not still hope? For aught I knew everything might\nyet be well. Marie might have escaped the slaughter as I had done, and\nif so, after all our troubles perchance many years of life and happiness\nawaited us. Only it seemed too good to be true.\n\nI flogged my horse, but the poor beast was tired out and could only\nbreak into short canters, that soon lapsed to a walk again. But whether\nit cantered or whether it walked, its hoofs seemed to beat out the\nwords--\"Too good to be true!\" Sometimes they beat them fast, and\nsometimes they beat them slow, but always their message seemed the same.\n\nHans, too, was outworn and weak from starvation. Also he had a cut upon\nhis foot which hampered him so much that at last he said I had better go\non alone; he would follow more slowly. Then I dismounted and set him on\nthe horse, walking by it myself.\n\nThus it came about that the gorgeous sunset was finished and the sky had\ngrown grey with night before we reached the foot of the koppie. Yet the\nlast rays of the sinking orb had shown me something as they died. There\non the slope of the hill stood some mud and wattle houses, such as I had\nordered to be built, and near to them several white-capped wagons. Only\nI did not see any smoke rising from those houses as there should have\nbeen at this hour of the day, when men cooked their evening food. The\nmoon would be up presently, I knew, but meanwhile it was dark and the\ntired horse stumbled and floundered among the stones which lay about at\nthe foot of the hill.\n\nI could bear it no longer.\n\n\"Hans,\" I said, \"do you stay here with the horse. I will creep to the\nhouses and see if any dwell there.\"\n\n\"Be careful, baas,\" he answered, \"lest you should find Zulus, for those\nblack devils are all about.\"\n\nI nodded, for I could not speak, and then began the ascent. For several\nhundred yards I crept from stone to stone, feeling my way, for the\nKaffir path that led to the little plateau where the spring was, above\nwhich the shanties stood, ran at the other end of the hill. I struck the\nspruit or rivulet that was fed by this spring, being guided to it by the\nmurmur of the water, and followed up its bank till I heard a sound which\ncaused me to crouch and listen.\n\nI could not be sure because of the ceaseless babble of the brook,\nbut the sound seemed like that of sobs. While I waited the great moon\nappeared suddenly above a bank of inky cloud, flooding the place with\nlight, and oh! by that light, looking more ethereal than woman I saw--I\nsaw Marie!\n\nShe stood not five paces from me, by the side of the stream, whither\nshe had come to draw water, for she held a vessel in her hand. She was\nclothed in some kind of a black garment, such as widows wear, but made\nof rough stuff, and above it her face showed white in the white rays\nof the moon. Gazing at her from the shadow, I could even see the tears\nrunning down her cheeks, for it was she who wept in this lonely place,\nwept for one who would return no more.\n\nMy voice choked in my throat; I could not utter a single word. Rising\nfrom behind a rock I moved towards her. She saw me and started, then\nsaid in a thrilling whisper:\n\n\"Oh! husband, has God sent you to call me? I am ready, husband, I am\nready!\" and she stretched out her arms wildly, letting fall the vessel,\nthat clanked upon the ground.\n\n\"Marie!\" I gasped at length; and at that word the blood rushed to her\nface and brow, and I saw her draw in her breath as though to scream.\n\n\"Hush!\" I whispered. \"It is I, Allan, who have escaped alive.\"\n\nThe next thing I remember was that she lay in my arms.\n\n\n\"What has happened here?\" I asked when I had told my tale, or some of\nit.\n\n\"Nothing, Allan,\" she answered. \"I received your letter at the camp, and\nwe trekked away as you bade us, without telling the others why, because\nyou remember the Commandant Retief wrote to us not to do so. So we were\nout of the great slaughter, for the Zulus did not know where we had\ngone, and never followed us here, although I have heard that they sought\nfor me. My father and my cousin Hernan only arrived at the camp two days\nafter the attack, and discovering or guessing our hiding-place--I know\nnot which--rode on hither. They say they came to warn the Boers to be\ncareful, for they did not trust Dingaan, but were too late. So they too\nwere out of the slaughter, for, Allan, many, many have been killed--they\nsay five or six hundred, most of them women and children. But thank God!\nmany more escaped, since the men came in from the other camps farther\noff and from their shooting parties, and drove away the Zulus, killing\nthem by scores.\"\n\n\"Are your father and Pereira here now?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, Allan. They learned of the massacre and that the Zulus were all\ngone yesterday morning. Also they got the bad news that Retief and\neveryone with him had been killed at Dingaan's town, it is said through\nthe treachery of the English, who arranged with Dingaan that he should\nkill them.\"\n\n\"That is false,\" I said; \"but go on.\"\n\n\"Then, Allan, they came and told me that I was a widow like many other\nwomen--I who had never been a wife. Allan, Hernan said that I should not\ngrieve for you, as you deserved your fate, since you had been caught in\nyour own snare, being one of those who had betrayed the Boers. The Vrouw\nPrinsloo answered to his face that he lied, and, Allan, I said that I\nwould never speak to him again until we met before the Judgment Seat of\nGod; nor will I do so.\"\n\n\"But I will speak to him,\" I muttered. \"Well, where are they now?\"\n\n\"They rode this morning back to the other Boers. I think they want to\nbring a party of them here to settle, if they like this place, as it\nis so easy to defend. They said they would return to-morrow, and that\nmeanwhile we were quite safe, as they had sure tidings that all the\nZulus were back over the Tugela, taking some of their wounded with them,\nand also the Boer cattle as an offering to Dingaan. But come to the\nhouse, Allan--our home that I had made ready for you as well as I could.\nOh! my God! our home on the threshold of which I believed you would\nnever set a foot. Yes, when the moon rose from that cloud I believed it,\nand look, they are still quite close together. Hark, what is that?\"\n\nI listened, and caught the sound of a horse's hoofs stumbling among the\nrocks.\n\n\"Don't be frightened,\" I answered; \"it is only Hans with my horse.\nHe escaped also; I will tell you how afterwards.\" And as I spoke he\nappeared, a woebegone and exhausted object.\n\n\"Good day, missie,\" he said with an attempt at cheerfulness. \"Now you\nshould give me a fine dinner, for you see I have brought the baas\nback safe to you. Did I not tell you, baas, that everything would come\nright?\"\n\nThen he grew silent from exhaustion. Nor were we sorry, who at that\nmoment did not wish to listen to the poor fellow's talk.\n\n\nSomething over two hours had gone by since the moon broke out from the\nclouds. I had greeted the Vrouw Prinsloo and all my other friends, and\nbeen received by them with rapture as one risen from the dead. If they\nhad loved me before, now a new gratitude was added to their love, since\nhad it not been for my warning they also must have made acquaintance\nwith the Zulu spears and perished. It was on their part of the camp that\nthe worst of the attack fell. Indeed, from those wagons hardly anyone\nescaped.\n\nI had told them all the story, to which they listened in dead silence.\nOnly when it was finished the Heer Meyer, whose natural gloom had been\ndeepened by all these events, said:\n\n\"Allemachte! but you have luck, Allan, to be left when everyone else\nis taken. Now, did I not know you so well, like Hernan Pereira I should\nthink that you and that devil Dingaan had winked at each other.\"\n\nThe Vrouw Prinsloo turned on him furiously.\n\n\"How dare you say such words, Carl Meyer?\" she exclaimed. \"Must Allan\nalways be insulted just because he is English, which he cannot help? For\nmy part, I think that if anyone winked at Dingaan it was the stinkcat\nPereira. Otherwise why did he come away before the killing and bring\nthat madman, Henri Marais, with him?\"\n\n\"I don't know, I am sure, aunt,\" said Meyer humbly, for like everyone\nelse he was afraid of the Vrouw Prinsloo.\n\n\"Then why can't you hold your tongue instead of saying silly things\nwhich must give pain?\" asked the vrouw. \"No, don't answer, for you will\nonly make matters worse; but take the rest of that meat to the poor\nHottentot, Hans\"--I should explain that we had been supping--\"who,\nalthough he has eaten enough to burst any white stomach, I dare say can\nmanage another pound or two.\"\n\nMeyer obeyed meekly, and the others melted away also as they were wont\nto do when the vrouw showed signs of war, so that she and we two were\nleft alone.\n\n\"Now,\" said the vrouw, \"everyone is tired, and I say that it is time to\ngo to rest. Good night, nephew Allan and niece Marie,\" and she waddled\naway leaving us together.\n\n\"Husband,\" said Marie presently, \"will you come and see the home that\nI made ready for you before I thought that you were dead? It is a poor\nplace, but I pray God that we may be happy there,\" and she took me by\nthe hand and kissed me once and twice and thrice.\n\n\nAbout noon on the following day, when my wife and I were laughing and\narguing over some little domestic detail of our meagre establishment--so\nsoon are great griefs forgotten in an overwhelming joy, of a sudden I\nsaw her face change, and asked what was the matter.\n\n\"Hist!\" she said, \"I hear horses,\" and she pointed in a certain\ndirection.\n\nI looked, and there, round the corner of the hill, came a body of Boers\nwith their after-riders, thirty-two or three of them in all, of whom\ntwenty were white men.\n\n\"See,\" said Marie, \"my father is among them, and my cousin Hernan rides\nat his side.\"\n\nIt was true. There was Henri Marais, and just behind him, talking into\nhis ear, rode Hernan Pereira. I remember that the two of them reminded\nme of a tale I had read about a man who was cursed with an evil genius\nthat drew him to some dreadful doom in spite of the promptings of his\nbetter nature. The thin, worn, wild-eyed Marais, and the rich-faced,\ncarnal Pereira whispering slyly into his ear; they were exact types of\nthat man in the story and his evil genius who dragged him down to hell.\nPrompted by some impulse, I threw my arms round Marie and embraced her,\nsaying:\n\n\"At least we have been very happy for a while.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Allan?\" she asked doubtfully.\n\n\"Only that I think our good hours are done with for the present.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" she answered slowly; \"but at least they have been very good\nhours, and if I should die to-day I am glad to have lived to win them.\"\n\nThen the cavalcade of Boers came up.\n\nHernan Pereira, his senses sharpened perhaps by the instincts of hate\nand jealousy, was the first to recognise me.\n\n\"Why, Mynheer Allan Quatermain,\" he said, \"how is it that you are here?\nHow is it that you still live? Commandant,\" he added, turning to a dark,\nsad-faced man of about sixty whom at that time I did not know, \"here\nis a strange thing. This Heer Quatermain, an Englishman, was with the\nGovernor Retief at the town of the Zulu king, as the Heer Henri Marais\ncan testify. Now, as we know for sure Pieter Retief and all his people\nare dead, murdered by Dingaan, how then does it happen that this man has\nescaped?\"\n\n\"Why do you put riddles to me, Mynheer Pereira?\" asked the dark Boer.\n\"Doubtless the Englishman will explain.\"\n\n\"Certainly I will, mynheer,\" I said. \"Is it your pleasure that I should\nspeak now?\"\n\nThe commandant hesitated. Then, having called Henri Marais apart and\ntalked to him for a little while, he replied:\n\n\"No, not now, I think; the matter is too serious. After we have eaten we\nwill listen to your story, Mynheer Quatermain, and meanwhile I command\nyou not to leave this place.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that I am a prisoner, commandant?\" I asked.\n\n\"If you put it so--yes, Mynheer Quatermain--a prisoner who has to\nexplain how some sixty of our brothers, who were your companions, came\nto be butchered like beasts in Zululand, while you escaped. Now, no\nmore words; by and by doubtless there will be plenty of them. Here you,\nCarolus and Johannes, keep watch upon this Englishman, of whom I hear\nstrange stories, with your guns loaded, please, and when we send to you,\nlead him before us.\"\n\n\"As usual, your cousin Hernan brings evil gifts,\" I said to Marie\nbitterly. \"Well, let us also eat our dinner, which perhaps the Heeren\nCarolus and Johannes will do us the honour to share--bringing their\nloaded guns with them.\"\n\nCarolus and Johannes accepted the invitation, and from them we heard\nmuch news, all of it terrible enough to learn, especially the details of\nthe massacre in that district, which, because of this fearful event is\nnow and always will be known as Weenen, or The Place of Weeping. Suffice\nit to say that they were quite enough to take away all our appetite,\nalthough Carolus and Johannes, who by this time had recovered somewhat\nfrom the shock of that night of blood and terror, ate in a fashion which\nmight have filled Hans himself with envy.\n\nShortly after we had finished our meal, Hans, who, by the way, seemed\nto have quite recovered from his fatigues, came to remove the dishes. He\ninformed us that all the Boers were having a great \"talk,\" and that they\nwere about to send for me. Sure enough, a few minutes later two armed\nmen arrived and ordered me to follow them. I turned to say some words of\nfarewell to Marie, but she said:\n\n\"I go where you do, husband,\" and, as no objection was made by the\nguard, she came.\n\nAbout two hundred yards away, sitting under the shade of one of the\nwagons, we found the Boers. Six of them were seated in a semicircle upon\nstools or whatever they could find, the black-browed commandant being\nin the centre and having in front of him a rough table on which were\nwriting materials.\n\nTo the left of these six were the Prinsloos and Meyers, being those folk\nwhom I had rescued from Delagoa, and to the right the other Boers\nwho had ridden into the camp that morning. I saw at a glance that a\ncourt-martial had been arranged and that the six elders were the judges,\nthe commandant being the president of the court.\n\nI do not give their names purposely, since I have no wish that the\nactual perpetrators of the terrible blunder that I am about to describe\nshould be known to posterity. After all, they acted honestly according\nto their lights, and were but tools in the hand of that villain Hernan\nPereira.\n\n\"Allan Quatermain,\" said the commandant, \"you are brought here to be\ntried by a court-martial duly constituted according to the law published\nin the camps of the emigrant Boers. Do you acknowledge that law?\"\n\n\"I know that there is such a law, commandant,\" I answered, \"but I do not\nacknowledge the authority of your court-martial to try a man who is no\nBoer, but a subject of the Queen of Great Britain.\"\n\n\"We have considered that point, Allan Quatermain,\" said the commandant,\n\"and we disallow it. You will remember that in the camp at Bushman's\nRiver, before you rode with the late Pieter Retief to the chief\nSikonyela, when you were given command of the Zulus who went with him,\nyou took an oath to interpret truly and to be faithful in all things\nto the General Retief, to his companions and to his cause. That oath we\nhold gives this court jurisdiction over you.\"\n\n\"I deny your jurisdiction,\" I answered, \"although it is true that I took\nan oath to interpret faithfully, and I request that a note of my denial\nmay be made in writing.\"\n\n\"It shall be done,\" said the commandant, and laboriously he made the\nnote on the paper before him.\n\nWhen he had finished he looked up and said: \"The charge against you,\nAllan Quatermain, is that, being one of the commission who recently\nvisited the Zulu king Dingaan, under command of the late Governor\nand General Pieter Retief, you did falsely and wickedly urge the\nsaid Dingaan to murder the said Pieter Retief and his companions, and\nespecially Henri Marais, your father-in-law, and Hernando Pereira, his\nnephew, with both of whom you had a quarrel. Further, that afterwards\nyou brought about the said murder, having first arranged with the king\nof the Zulus that you should be removed to a place of safety while it\nwas done. Do you plead Guilty or Not guilty?\"\n\nNow when I heard this false and abominable charge my rage and\nindignation caused me to laugh aloud.\n\n\"Are you mad, commandant,\" I exclaimed, \"that you should say such\nthings? On what evidence is this wicked lie advanced against me?\"\n\n\"No, Allan Quatermain, I am not mad,\" he replied, \"although it is\ntrue that through your evil doings I, who have lost my wife and three\nchildren by the Zulu spears, have suffered enough to make me mad. As for\nthe evidence against you, you shall hear it. But first I will write down\nthat you plead Not guilty.\"\n\nHe did so, then said:\n\n\"If you will acknowledge certain things it will save us all much time,\nof which at present we have little to spare. Those things are that\nknowing what was going to happen to the commission, you tried to avoid\naccompanying it. Is that true?\"\n\n\"No,\" I answered. \"I knew nothing of what was going to happen to the\ncommission, though I feared something, having but just saved my friends\nthere\"--and I pointed to the Prinsloos--\"from death at the hands of\nDingaan. I did not wish to accompany it for another reason: that I had\nbeen married on the day of its starting to Marie Marais. Still, I went\nafter all because the General Retief, who was my friend, asked me to\ncome, to interpret for him.\"\n\nNow some of the Boers present said:\n\n\"That is true. We remember.\"\n\nBut the commandant continued, taking no heed of my answer or these\ninterruptions.\n\n\"Do you acknowledge that you were on bad terms with Henri Marais and\nwith Hernan Pereira?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered; \"because Henri Marais did all in his power to prevent\nmy marriage with his daughter Marie, behaving very ill to me who had\nsaved his life and that of his people who remained to him up by Delagoa,\nand afterwards at Umgungundhlovu. Because, too, Hernan Pereira strove to\nrob me of Marie, who loved me. Moreover, although I had saved him when\nhe lay sick to death, he afterwards tried to murder me by shooting\nme down in a lonely place. Here is the mark of it,\" and I touched the\nlittle scar upon the side of my forehead.\n\n\"That is true; he did so, the stinkcat,\" shouted the Vrouw Prinsloo, and\nwas ordered to be silent.\n\n\"Do you acknowledge,\" went on the commandant, \"that you sent to warn\nyour wife and those with her to depart from the camp on the Bushman's\nRiver, because it was going to be attacked, charging them to keep the\nmatter secret, and that afterwards both you and your Hottentot servant\nalone returned safely from Zululand, where all those who went with you\nlie dead?\"\n\n\"I acknowledge,\" I answered, \"that I wrote to tell my wife to come to\nthis place where I had been building houses, as you see, and to bring\nwith her any of our companions who cared to trek here, or, failing that,\nto go alone. This I did because Dingaan had told me, whether in jest or\nin earnest I did not know, that he had given orders that my said wife\nshould be kidnapped, as he desired to make her one of his women, having\nthought her beautiful when he saw her. Also what I did was done with the\nknowledge and by the wish of the late Governor Retief, as can be shown\nby his writing on my letter. I acknowledge also that I escaped when all\nmy brothers were killed, as did the Hottentot Hans, and if you wish to\nknow I will tell you how we escaped and why.\"\n\nThe commandant made a further note, then he said:\n\n\"Let the witness Hernan Pereira be called and sworn.\"\n\nThis was done and he was ordered to tell his tale.\n\nAs may be imagined, it was a long tale, and one that had evidently been\nprepared with great care. I will only set down its blackest falsehoods.\nHe assured the court that he had no enmity against me and had never\nattempted to kill me or do me any harm, although it was true that his\nheart felt sore because, against her father's will, I had stolen away\nthe affection of his betrothed, who was now my wife. He said that he had\nstopped in Zululand because he knew that I should marry her as soon as\nshe came of age, and it was too great pain for him to see this done.\nHe said that while he was there, before the arrival of the commission,\nDingaan and some of his captains had told him that I had again and again\nurged him, Dingaan, to kill the Boers because they were traitors to the\nsovereign of England, but that he, Dingaan, had refused to do so. He\nsaid that when Retief came up with the commission he tried to warn him\nagainst me, but that Retief would not listen, being infatuated with me\nas many others were, and he looked towards the Prinsloos.\n\nThen came the worst of all. He said that while he was engaged in\nmending some guns for Dingaan in one of his private huts, he overheard\na conversation between myself and Dingaan which took place outside the\nhut, I, of course, not knowing that he was within. The substance of\nthis conversation was that I again urged Dingaan to kill the Boers and\nafterwards to send an impi to massacre their wives and families. Only\nI asked him to give me time to get away a girl whom I had married from\namong them, and with her a few of my own friends whom I wished should\nbe spared, as I intended to become a kind of chief over them, and if he\nwould grant it me, to hold all the land of Natal under his rule and\nthe protection of the English. To these proposals Dingaan answered\nthat \"they seemed wise and good, and that he would think them over very\ncarefully.\"\n\nPereira said further that coming out of the hut after Dingaan had gone\naway he reproached me bitterly for my wickedness, and announced that he\nwould warn the Boers, which he did subsequently by word of mouth and in\nwriting. That thereon I caused him to be detained by the Zulus while I\nwent to Retief and told him some false story about him, Pereira, which\ncaused Retief to drive him out of his camp and give orders that none\nof the Boers should so much as speak to him. That then he did the only\nthing he could. Going to his uncle, Henri Marais, he told him, not all\nthe truth, but that he had learnt for certain that his daughter Marie\nwas in dreadful danger of her life because of some intended attack of\nthe Zulus, and that all the Boers among whom she dwelt were also in\ndanger of their lives.\n\nTherefore he suggested to Henri Marais that as the General Retief was\nbesotted and would not listen to his story, the best thing they could\ndo was to ride away and warn the Boers. This then they did secretly,\nwithout the knowledge of Retief, but being delayed upon their journey by\none accident and another, which he set out in detail, they only reached\nthe Bushman's River too late, after the massacre had taken place.\nSubsequently, as the commandant knew, hearing a rumour that Marie Marais\nand other Boers had trekked to this place before the slaughter, they\ncame here and learned that they had done so upon a warning sent to them\nby Allan Quatermain, whereon they returned and communicated the news to\nthe surviving Boers at Bushman's River.\n\nThat was all he had to say.\n\nThen, as I reserved my cross-examination until I heard all the evidence\nagainst me, Henri Marais was sworn and corroborated his nephew's\ntestimony on many points as to my relations to his daughter, his\nobjection to my marriage to her because I was an Englishman whom he\ndisliked and mistrusted, and so forth. He added further that it was true\nPereira had told him he had sure information that Marie and the Boers\nwere in danger from an attack upon them which had been arranged between\nAllan Quatermain and Dingaan; that he also had written to Retief and\ntried to speak to him but was refused a hearing. Thereon he had ridden\naway from Umgungundhlovu to try to save his daughter and warn the Boers.\nThat was all he had to say.\n\nAs there were no further witnesses for the prosecution I cross-examined\nthese two at full length, but absolutely without results, since every\nvital question that I asked was met with a direct negative.\n\nThen I called my witnesses, Marie, whose evidence they refused to hear\non the ground that she was my wife and prejudiced, the Vrouw Prinsloo\nand her family, and the Meyers. One and all told a true story of my\nrelations with Hernan Pereira, Henri Marais, and Dingaan, so far as they\nknew them.\n\nAfter this, as the commandant declined to take the evidence of Hans\nbecause he was a Hottentot and my servant, I addressed the court,\nrelating exactly what had taken place between me and Dingaan, and how I\nand Hans came to escape on our second visit to his kraal. I pointed out\nalso that unhappily for myself I could not prove my words, since Dingaan\nwas not available as a witness, and all the others were dead. Further,\nI produced my letter to Marie, which was endorsed by Retief, and the\nletter to Retief signed by Marais and Pereira which remained in my\npossession.\n\nBy the time that I had finished my speech the sun was setting and\neveryone was tired out. I was ordered to withdraw under guard, while\nthe court consulted, which it did for a long while. Then I was called\nforward again and the commandant said:\n\n\"Allan Quatermain, after prayer to God we have considered this case to\nthe best of our judgment and ability. On the one hand we note that\nyou are an Englishman, a member of a race which hates and has always\noppressed our people, and that it was to your interest to get rid of two\nof them with whom you had quarrelled. The evidence of Henri Marais and\nHernan Pereira, which we cannot disbelieve, shows that you were wicked\nenough, either in order to do this, or because of your malice against\nthe Boer people, to plot their destruction with a savage. The result is\nthat some seven hundred men, women, and children have lost their lives\nin a very cruel manner, whereas you, your servant, your wife and your\nfriends have alone escaped unharmed. For such a crime as this a\nhundred deaths could not pay; indeed, God alone can give to it its\njust punishment, and to Him it is our duty to send you to be judged.\nWe condemn you to be shot as a traitor and a murderer, and may He have\nmercy on your soul.\"\n\nAt these dreadful words Marie fell to the ground fainting and a pause\nensued while she was carried off to the Prinsloos' house, whither the\nvrouw followed to attend her. Then the commandant went on:\n\n\"Still, although we have thus passed judgment on you; because you are\nan Englishman against whom it might be said that we had prejudices,\nand because you have had no opportunity of preparing a defence, and\nno witnesses to the facts, since all those whom you say you could have\ncalled are dead, we think it right that this unanimous sentence of ours\nshould be confirmed by a general court of the emigrant Boers. Therefore\nto-morrow morning you will be taken with us to the Bushman's River camp,\nwhere the case will be settled, and, if necessary, execution done in\naccordance with the verdict of the generals and veld-cornets of that\ncamp. Meanwhile you will be kept in custody in your own house. Now have\nyou anything to say against this sentence?\"\n\n\"Yes, this,\" I answered, \"that although you do not know it, it is an\nunjust sentence, built up on the lies of one who has always been my\nenemy, and of a man whose brain is rotten. I never betrayed the Boers.\nIf anyone betrayed them it was Hernan Pereira himself, who, as I proved\nto the General Retief, had been praying Dingaan to kill me, and whom\nRetief threatened to put upon his trial for this very crime, for which\nreason and no other Pereira fled from the kraal, taking his tool Henri\nMarais with him. You have asked God to judge me. Well, I ask God to\njudge him and Henri Marais also, and I know He will in one way or\nanother. As for me, I am ready to die, as I have been for months while\nserving the cause of you Boers. Shoot me now if you will, and make an\nend. But I tell you that if I escape your hands I will not suffer this\ntreatment to go unpunished. I will lay my case before the rulers of my\npeople, and if necessary before my Queen, yes, if I have to travel to\nLondon to do it, and you Boers shall learn that you cannot condemn an\ninnocent Englishman upon false testimony and not pay the price. I\ntell you that price shall be great if I live, and if I die it shall be\ngreater still.\"\n\nNow these words, very foolish words, I admit, which being young and\ninexperienced I spoke in my British pride, I could see made a great\nimpression upon my judges. They believed, to be fair to them, that they\nhad passed a just sentence. Blinded by prejudice and falsehood, and\nmaddened by the dreadful losses their people had suffered during the\npast few days at the hands of a devilish savage, they believed that I\nwas the instigator of those losses, one who ought to die. Indeed, all,\nor nearly all the Boers were persuaded that Dingaan was urged to this\nmassacre by the counsels of Englishmen. The mere fact of my own and my\nservant's miraculous escape, when all my companions had perished,\nproved my guilt to them without the evidence of Pereira, which, being no\nlawyers, they thought sufficient to justify their verdict.\n\nStill, they had an uneasy suspicion that this evidence was not\nconclusive, and might indeed be rejected in toto by a more competent\ncourt upon various grounds. Also they knew themselves to be rebels who\nhad no legal right to form a court, and feared the power of the long arm\nof England, from which for a little while they had escaped. If I were\nallowed to tell my tale to the Parliament in London, what might not\nhappen to them, they wondered--to them who had ventured to pass sentence\nof death upon a subject of the Queen of Great Britain? Might not this\nturn the scale against them? Might not Britain arise in wrath and crush\nthem, these men who dared to invoke her forms of law in order to kill\nher citizen? Those, as I learned afterwards, were the thoughts that\npassed through their minds.\n\nAlso another thought passed through their minds--that if the sentence\nwere executed at once, a dead man cannot appeal, and that here I had\nno friends to take up my cause and avenge me. But of all this they\nsaid nothing. Only at a sign I was marched away to my little house and\nimprisoned under guard.\n\nNow I propose to tell the rest of the history of these tragic events as\nthey happened, although some of them did not come to my knowledge till\nthe morrow or afterwards, for I think this will be the more simple and\nthe easier plan.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. THE INNOCENT BLOOD\n\n\nAfter I had been taken away it seems that the court summoned Hernan\nPereira and Henri Marais to accompany them to a lonely spot at a\ndistance, where they thought that their deliberations would not be\noverheard. In this, however, they were mistaken, having forgotten the\nfox-like cunning of the Hottentot, Hans. Hans had heard me sentenced,\nand probably enough feared that he who also had committed the crime of\nescaping from Dingaan, might be called on to share that sentence. Also\nhe wished to know the secret counsel of these Boers, whose language, of\ncourse, he understood as well as he did his own.\n\nSo making a circuit up the hillside, he crept towards them on his belly\nas a snake creeps, wriggling in and out between the tufts of last year's\ndead grass, which grew here in plenty, without so much as moving their\ntops. At length he lay still in the centre of a bush that grew behind\na stone not five paces from where they were talking, whence he listened\nintently to every word that passed their lips.\n\nThis was the substance of their talk; that for the reasons I have\nalready mentioned it would be best that I should die at once. Sentence,\nsaid the commandant, had been passed, and could not be rescinded, since\neven if it were, their offence would remain as heavy in the eyes of\nthe English authorities. But if they took me to their main camp to\nbe re-tried by their great council, possibly that sentence might be\nrescinded and they be left individually and collectively to atone for\nwhat they had done. Also they knew that I was very clever and might\nescape in some other way to bring the English, or possibly the Zulus,\nupon them, since they felt convinced that Dingaan and I were working\ntogether for their destruction, and that while I had breath in my body I\nshould never cease my efforts to be avenged.\n\nWhen it was found that they were all of one mind in this matter, the\nquestion arose: What should be done? Somebody suggested that I should be\nshot at once, but the commandant pointed out that such a deed, worked\nat night, would look like murder, especially as it violated the terms of\ntheir verdict.\n\nThen another suggestion was made: that I should be brought out of my\nhouse just before the dawn on pretence that it was time to ride; that\nthen I should be given the opportunity of escape and instantly shot\ndown. Or it might be pretended that I had tried to escape, with a like\nresult. Who, they urged, was to know in that half-light whether I had\nor had not actually attempted to run for my life, or to threaten their\nlives, circumstances under which the law said it was justifiable to\nshoot a prisoner already formally condemned to death?\n\nTo this black counsel they all agreed, being so terribly afraid of a\npoor English lad whose existence, although most of them did not know\nthis, was to be taken from him upon false evidence. But then arose\nanother question: By whose hand should the thing be done? Not one of\nthem, it would seem, was anxious to fulfil this bloody office; indeed,\nthey one and all refused to do so. A proposal was put forward that some\nof their native servants should be forced to serve as executioners;\nbut when this had been vetoed by the general sense of the court, their\ncounsels came to a deadlock.\n\nThen, after a whispered conference, the commandant spoke some dreadful\nwords.\n\n\"Hernando Pereira and Henri Marais,\" he said, \"it is on your evidence\nthat this young man has been condemned. We believe that evidence, but\nif by one jot or one tittle it is false, then not justice, but a foul\nmurder will have been committed and his innocent blood will be upon your\nheads for ever. Hernando Pereira and Henri Marais, the court appoints\nyou to be the guards who will bring the prisoner out of his house\nto-morrow morning just when the sky begins to lighten. It is from _you_\nthat he will try to escape, and _you_ will prevent his escape by his\ndeath. Then you must join us where we shall be waiting for you and\nreport the execution.\"\n\nWhen Henri Marais heard this he exclaimed:\n\n\"I swear by God that I cannot do it. Is it right or natural that a man\nshould be forced to kill his own son-in-law?\"\n\n\"You could bear evidence against your own son-in-law, Henri Marais,\"\nanswered the stern-faced commandant. \"Why then cannot you kill with your\nrifle one whom you have already helped to kill with your tongue?\"\n\n\"I will not, I cannot!\" said Marais, tearing at his beard. But the\ncommandant only answered coldly:\n\n\"You have the orders of the court, and if you choose to disobey them we\nshall begin to believe that you have sworn falsely. Then you and your\nnephew will also appear before the great council when the Englishman\nis tried again. Still, it matters nothing to us whether you or Hernando\nPereira shall fire the shot. See you to it, as the Jews said to Judas\nwho had betrayed the innocent Lord.\"\n\nThen he paused and went on, addressing Pereira:\n\n\"Do you also refuse, Hernando Pereira? Remember before you answer that\nif you do refuse we shall draw our own conclusions. Remember, too, that\nthe evidence which you have given, showing that this wicked Englishman\nplotted and caused the deaths of our brothers and of our wives and\nchildren, which we believe to be true evidence, shall be weighed and\ninvestigated word by word before the great council.\"\n\n\"To give evidence is one thing, and to shoot the traitor and murderer\nanother,\" said Pereira. Then he added with an oath, or so vowed Hans:\n\"Yet why should I, who know all this villain's guilt, refuse to carry\nout the sentence of the law on him? Have no fear, commandant, the\naccursed Allan Quatermain shall not succeed in his attempt to escape\nto-morrow before the dawn.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" said the commandant. \"Now, do all you who have heard those\nwords take note of them.\"\n\nThen Hans, seeing that the council was about to break up, and fearing\nlest he should be caught and killed, slipped away by the same road\nthat he had come. His thought was to warn me, but this he could not\ndo because of the guards. So he went to the Prinsloos, and finding the\nvrouw alone with Marie, who had recovered her mind, told them everything\nthat he had heard.\n\nAs he said, Marie knelt down and prayed, or thought for a long while,\nthen rose and spoke.\n\n\"Tante,\" she said to the vrouw, \"one thing is clear, that Allan will be\nmurdered at the dawn; now if he is hidden away he may escape.\"\n\n\"But where and how can we hide him,\" asked the vrouw, \"seeing that the\nplace is guarded?\"\n\n\"Tante,\" said Marie again, \"at the back of your house is an old cattle\nkraal made by Kaffirs, and in that cattle kraal, as I have seen, there\nare mealie-pits where those Kaffirs stored their grain. Now I suggest\nthat we should put my husband into one of those mealie-pits and cover it\nover. There the Boers might not find him, however close they searched.\"\n\n\"That is a good idea,\" said the vrouw; \"but how in the name of God are\nwe to get Allan out of a guarded house into a mealie-pit?\"\n\n\"Tante, I have a right to go to my husband's house, and there I will go.\nAfterwards, too, I shall have the right to leave his house before he is\ntaken away. Well, he might leave it in my place, _as me_, and you and\nHans might help him. Then in the morning the Boers would come to search\nthe house and find no one except me.\"\n\n\"That is all very pretty,\" answered the vrouw; \"but do you think, my\nniece, that those accursed vultures will go away until they have picked\nAllan's bones? Not they, for too much hangs on it. They will know that\nhe cannot be far off, and slink about the place until they have found\nhim in his mealie-hole or until he comes out. It is blood they are\nafter, thanks to your cousin Hernan, the liar, and blood they will have\nfor their own safety's sake. Never will they go away from here until\nthey see Allan lying dead upon the ground.\"\n\nNow, according to Hans, Marie thought again very deeply. Then she\nanswered:\n\n\"There is a great risk, tante; but we must take it. Send your husband\nto chat with those guards, and give him a bottle of spirits. I will talk\nwith Hans here and see what can be arranged.\"\n\nSo Marie went aside with Hans, as he told me afterwards, and asked\nhim if he knew of any medicine that made people sleep for a long while\nwithout waking. He answered, Yes; all the coloured people had plenty\nof such medicine. Without doubt he could get some from the Kaffirs who\ndwelt upon the place, or if not he could dig the roots of a plant that\nhe had seen growing near by which would serve the purpose. So she sent\nhim to procure this stuff. Afterwards she spoke to the Vrouw Prinsloo,\nsaying:\n\n\"My plan is that Allan should escape from our house disguised as myself.\nBut as I know well that he will not run away while he has his senses,\nseeing that to do so in his mind would be to confess his guilt, I\npropose to take his senses from him by means of a drugged drink. Then\nI propose that you and Hans should carry him into the shadow of this\nhouse, and when no one is looking, to the old grain-pit that lies but a\nfew yards away, covering the mouth of it with dead grass. There he will\nremain till the Boers grow tired of searching for him and ride away. Or\nif it should chance that they find him, he will be no worse off than he\nwas before.\"\n\n\"A good plan enough, Marie, though not one that Allan would have\nanything to do with if he kept his wits,\" answered the vrouw, \"seeing\nthat he was always a man for facing things out, although so young in\nyears. Still, we will try to save him in spite of himself from the claws\nof that stinkcat Pereira, whom may God curse, and his tool, your father.\nAs you say, at the worst no harm will be done even if they find him, as\nprobably they will, seeing that they will not leave this place without\nblood.\"\n\nSuch then was the trick which Marie arranged with the Vrouw Prinsloo. Or\nrather, I should say, seemed to arrange, since she told her nothing of\nher real mind, she who knew that the vrouw was right and that for their\nown sakes, as well as because they believed it to be justice, the Boers\nwould never leave that place until they saw blood running on the grass.\n\nThis, oh! this was Marie's true and dreadful plan--_to give her life for\nmine!_ She was sure that once he had slain his victim, Hernan Pereira\nwould not stop to make examination of the corpse. He would ride away,\nhounded by his guilty conscience, and meanwhile I could escape.\n\nShe never thought the thing out in all its details, she who was maddened\nwith terror and had no time. She only felt her way from step to step,\ndimly seeing my deliverance at the end of the journey. Marie told the\nVrouw Prinsloo nothing, except that she proposed to drug me if I would\nnot go undrugged. Then the vrouw must hide me as best she could, in the\ngrain-pit or elsewhere, or, if I had my senses about me, let me hide\nmyself. Afterwards she, Marie, would face the Boers and tell them to\nfind me if they wanted me.\n\nThe vrouw answered that she had now thought of a better plan. It was\nthat she should arrange with her husband and son and the Meyers, all\nof whom loved me, that they should rescue me, or if need be, kill or\ndisable Pereira before he could shoot me.\n\nMarie replied that this was good if it could be done, and the vrouw\nwent out to find her husband and the other men. Presently, however, she\nreturned with a long face, saying that the commandant had them all\nunder guard. It seemed that it had occurred to him, or more probably\nto Pereira, that the Prinsloos and the Meyers, who looked on me as a\nbrother, might attempt some rescue, or make themselves formidable in\nother ways. Therefore, as a matter of precaution, they had been put\nunder arrest and their arms taken from them as mine had been. What the\ncommandant said, however, was that he took these somewhat high-handed\nmeasures in order to be sure that they, the Prinsloos and the Meyers,\nshould be ready on the following morning to ride with him and the\nprisoner to the main camp, where the great council might wish to\ninterrogate them.\n\nOne concession, however, the vrouw had won from the commandant, who,\nknowing what was about to happen to me, had not, I suppose, the heart to\nrefuse. It was that my wife and she might visit me and give me food on\nthe stipulation that they both left the house where I was confined by\nten o'clock that night.\n\nSo it came to this, that if anything was to be done, these two women\nand a Hottentot must do it, since they could hope for no help in their\nplans. Here I should add that the vrouw told Marie in Hans's presence\nthat she had thought of attacking the commandant as to this matter of my\nproposed shooting by Pereira. On reflection, however, she refrained for\ntwo reasons, first because she feared lest she might only make matters\nworse and rob me of my sole helpers, and secondly for fear lest she\nshould bring about the death of Hans, to whom the story would certainly\nbe traced.\n\nAs he was the solitary witness to the plot, it seemed to her that\nhe would scarcely be allowed to escape to repeat it far and wide.\nEspecially was this so, as the unexplained death of a Hottentot,\nsuspected of treachery like his master, was not a matter that would have\nbeen thought worth notice in those rough and bloody times. She may have\nbeen right, or she may have been wrong, but in weighing her decision it\nmust always be borne in mind that she was, and until the end remained,\nin utter ignorance of Marie's heroic design to go to her death in place\nof me.\n\nSo the two women and the Hottentot proceeded to mature the plans which I\nhave outlined. One other alternative, however, Hans did suggest. It was\nthat they should try to drug the guards with some of the medicated drink\nthat was meant for me, and that then Marie, I and he should slip away\nand get down to the river, there to hide in the weeds. Thence, perhaps,\nwe might escape to Port Natal where lived Englishmen who would protect\nus.\n\nOf course this idea was hopeless from the first. The moonlight was\nalmost as bright as day, and the veld quite open for a long way round,\nso that we should certainly have been seen and re-captured, which of\ncourse would have meant instant death. Further, as it happened, the\nguards had been warned against touching liquor of any sort since it was\nthought probable that an attempt would be made to intoxicate them. Still\nthe women determined to try this scheme if they could find a chance. At\nleast it was a second string to their bow.\n\nMeanwhile they made their preparations. Hans went away for a little and\nreturned with a supply of his sleep-producing drug, though whether he\ngot this from the Kaffirs or gathered it himself, I do not remember, if\nI ever heard. At any rate it was boiled up in the water with which they\nmade the coffee that I was to drink, though not in that which Marie\nproposed to drink with me, the strong taste and black hue of the coffee\neffectually hiding any flavour or colour that there might be in the\nherb. Also the vrouw cooked some food which she gave to Hans to carry.\nFirst, however, he went to investigate the old mealie-pit which was\nwithin a few paces of the back door of the Prinsloos' house. He reported\nthat it would do well to hide a man in, especially as tall grass and\nbushes grew about its mouth.\n\nThen the three of them started, and arriving at the door of my house,\nwhich was about a hundred yards away, were of course challenged by the\nsentries.\n\n\"Heeren,\" said Marie, \"the commandant has given us leave to bring\nfood to my husband, whom you guard within. Pray do not prevent us from\nentering.\"\n\n\"No,\" answered one of them gently enough, for he was touched with pity\nat her plight. \"We have our orders to admit you, the Vrouw Prinsloo and\nthe native servant, though why three of you should be needed to carry\nfood to one man, I don't know. I should have thought that at such a time\nhe would have preferred to be alone with his wife.\"\n\n\"The Vrouw Prinsloo wishes to ask my husband certain questions about his\nproperty here and what is to be done while he and her men are away at\nthe main camp for the second trial, as I, whose heart is full of sorrow,\nhave no head for such things. Also the Hottentot must have orders as\nto where he is to get a horse to ride with him, so pray let us pass,\nmynheer.\"\n\n\"Very good; it is no affair of ours, Vrouw Quatermain-- Stay, I suppose\nthat you have no arms under that long cloak of yours.\"\n\n\"Search me, if you will, mynheer,\" she answered, opening the cloak,\nwhereon, after a quick glance, he nodded and bade them enter, saying:\n\n\"Mind, you are to come out by ten o'clock. You must not pass the night\nin that house, or we shall have the little Englishman oversleeping\nhimself in the morning.\"\n\nThen they entered and found me seated at a table preparing notes for\nmy defence and setting down the heads of the facts of my relations with\nPereira, Dingaan, and the late Commandant Retief.\n\nHere I may state that my condition at the time was not one of fear, but\nrather of burning indignation. Indeed, I had not the slightest doubt\nbut that when my case was re-tried before the great council, I should be\nable to establish my complete innocence of the abominable charges that\nhad been brought against me. Therefore it came about that when Marie\nsuggested that I should try to escape, I begged her almost roughly not\nto mention such a thing again.\n\n\"Run away!\" I said. \"Why, that would be to confess myself guilty, for\nonly the guilty run away. What I want is to have all this business\nthrashed out and that devil Pereira exposed.\"\n\n\"But, Allan,\" said Marie, \"how if you should never live to have it\nthrashed out? How if you should be shot first?\" Then she rose, and\nhaving looked to see that the shutter-board was fast in the little\nwindow-place and the curtain that she had made of sacking drawn over\nit, returned and whispered: \"Hans here has heard a horrible tale, Allan.\nTell it to the baas, Hans.\"\n\nSo while Vrouw Prinsloo, in order to deceive any prying eyes if such by\nchance could see us, busied herself with lighting a fire on the hearth\nin the second room on which to warm the food, Hans told his story much\nas it has already been set out.\n\nI listened to it with growing incredulity. The thing seemed to me\nimpossible. Either Hans was deceived or lying, the latter probably,\nfor well I knew the Hottentot powers of imagination. Or perhaps he was\ndrunk; indeed, he smelt of liquor, of which I was aware he could carry a\ngreat quantity without outward signs of intoxication.\n\n\"I cannot believe it,\" I said when he had finished. \"Even if Pereira is\nsuch a fiend, as is possible, would Henri Marais, your father--who, at\nany rate, has always been a good and God-fearing man--consent to work\nsuch a crime upon his daughter's husband, though he does dislike him?\"\n\n\"My father is not what he was, Allan,\" said Marie. \"Sometimes I think\nthat his brain has gone.\"\n\n\"He did not speak like a man whose brain has gone this afternoon,\" I\nreplied. \"But let us suppose that this tale is true, what is it that you\nwish me to do?\"\n\n\"Allan, I wish you to dress up in my clothes and get away to a\nhiding-place which Hans and the vrouw know, leaving me here instead of\nyou.\"\n\n\"Why, Marie?\" I said. \"Then you might get yourself shot in my place,\nalways supposing that they mean to shoot me. Also I should certainly be\ncaught and killed, as they would have a right to kill me for trying\nto escape in disguise. That is a mad plan, and I have a better. Vrouw\nPrinsloo, go straight to the commandant ad tell him all this story. Or,\nif he will not listen to you, scream it out at the top of your voice so\nthat everyone may hear, and then come back and tell us the result. Of\none thing I am sure, that if you do this, even if there was any thought\nof my being shot tomorrow morning, it will be abandoned. You can refuse\nto say who told you the tale.\"\n\n\"Yes, please do that,\" muttered Hans, \"else I know one who will be\nshot.\"\n\n\"Good, I will go,\" said the vrouw, and she went, the guards letting her\npass after a few words which we could not hear.\n\nHalf an hour later she returned and called to us to open the door.\n\n\"Well?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"I have failed, nephew. Except those sentries outside\nthe door, the commandant and all the Boers have ridden off, I know not\nwhere, taking our people with them.\"\n\n\"That's odd,\" I answered, \"but I suppose they thought they had not\nenough grass for their horses, or Heaven knows what they thought.\nStay now, I will do something,\" and, opening the door, I called to the\nguards, honest fellows in their way, whom I had known in past times.\n\n\"Listen, friends,\" I said. \"A tale has been brought to me that I am not\nto be taken to the big camp to have my case inquired of by the council,\nbut am to be shot down in cold blood when I come out of this house\nto-morrow morning. Is that true?\"\n\n\"Allemachte, Englishman!\" answered one of them. \"Do you take us for\nmurderers? Our orders are to lead you to the commandant wherever he may\nappoint, so have no fear that we shall shoot you like a Kaffir. Either\nyou or they who told you such a story are mad.\"\n\n\"So I thought, friends,\" I answered. \"But where is the commandant and\nwhere are the others? The Vrouw Prinsloo here has been to see them, and\nreports that they are all gone.\"\n\n\"That is very likely,\" said the Boer. \"There is a rumour that some of\nyour Zulu brothers have come across the Tugela again to hunt us, which,\nif you want to know the truth, is why we visited this place. Well, the\ncommandant has taken his men for a ride to see if he can meet them by\nthis bright moonlight. Pity he could not take you, too, since you would\nhave known so well where to find them, if they are there at all. Now\nplease talk no more nonsense to us, which it makes us sick to hear, and\ndon't think that you can slip away because we are only two, for you know\nour roers are loaded with slugs, and we have orders to use them.\"\n\n\"There,\" I said when I had shut the door, \"now you have heard for\nyourselves. As I thought, there is nothing in this fine story, so I hope\nyou are convinced.\"\n\nNeither the vrouw nor Marie made any answer, and Hans also held his\ntongue. Yet, as I remembered afterwards, I saw a strange glance pass\nbetween the two women, who were not at all convinced, and, although I\nnever dreamed of such a thing, had now determined to carry out their own\ndesperate plan. But of this I repeat the vrouw and Hans only knew one\nhalf; the rest was locked in Marie's loving heart.\n\n\"Perhaps you are right, Allan,\" said the vrouw in the tone of one who\ngives way to an unreasonable child. \"I hope so, and, at any rate, you\ncan refuse to come out of the house to-morrow morning until you are\nquite sure. And now let us eat some supper, for we shall not make\nmatters better by going hungry. Hans, bring the food.\"\n\nSo we ate, or made pretence to eat, and I, being thirsty, drank two cups\nof the black coffee dashed with spirit to serve as milk. After this I\ngrew strangely sleepy. The last thing I remember was Marie looking at me\nwith her beautiful eyes, that were full--ah! so full of tender love, and\nkissing me again and again upon the lips.\n\n\nI dreamed all sorts of dreams, rather pleasant dreams on the whole.\nThen I woke up by degrees to find myself in an earthen pit shaped like a\nbottle and having the remains of polished sides to it. It made me think\nof Jos\u00e9ph who was let down by his brethren into a well in the desert.\nNow, who on earth could have let me down into a well, especially as I\nhad no brethren? Perhaps I was not really in a well. Perhaps this was\na nightmare. Or I might be dead. I began to remember that there were\ncertain good reasons why I should be dead. Only, only--why should they\nhave buried me in woman's clothes as I seemed to wear?\n\nAnd what was that noise that had wakened me?\n\nIt could not be the trump of doom, unless the trumping of doom went off\nlike a double-barrelled gun.\n\nI began to try to climb out of my hole, but as it was nine feet deep and\nbottle-shaped, which the light flowing in from the neck showed, I found\nthis impossible. Just as I was giving up the attempt, a yellow face\nappeared in that neck, which looked to me like the face of Hans, and an\narm was projected downwards.\n\n\"Jump, if you are awake, baas,\" said a voice--surely it was the voice of\nHans--\"and I will pull you out.\"\n\nSo I jumped, and caught the arm above the wrist. Then the owner of\nthe arm pulled desperately, and the end of it was that I succeeded in\ngripping the edge of the bottle-like hole, and, with the help of the\narm, in dragging myself out.\n\n\"Now, baas,\" said Hans, for it _was_ Hans, \"run, run before the Boers\ncatch you.\"\n\n\"What Boers?\" I asked, sleepily; \"and how can I run with these things\nflapping about my legs?\"\n\nThen I looked about me, and, although the dawn was only just breaking,\nbegan to recognise my surroundings. Surely this was the Prinsloos' house\nto my right, and that, faintly seen through the mist about a hundred\npaces away, was Marie's and my own. There seemed to be something going\non yonder which excited my awakening curiosity. I could see figures\nmoving in an unusual manner, and desired to know what they were doing. I\nbegan to walk towards them, and Hans, for his part, began to try to drag\nme in an opposite direction, uttering all sorts of gibberish as to the\nnecessity of my running away. But I would not be dragged; indeed, I\nstruck at him, until at last, with an exclamation of despair, he let go\nof me and vanished.\n\nSo I went on alone. I came to my house, or what I thought resembled\nit, and there saw a figure lying on its face on the ground some ten or\nfifteen yards to the right of the doorway, and noted abstractedly that\nit was dressed in my clothes. The Vrouw Prinsloo, in her absurd night\ngarments, was waddling towards the figure, and a little way off stood\nHernan Pereira, apparently in the act of reloading a double-barrelled\ngun. Beyond, staring at him, stood the lantern-faced Henri Marais,\npulling at his long beard with one hand and holding a rifle in the\nother. Behind were two saddled horses in the charge of a raw Kaffir, who\nlooked on stupidly.\n\nThe Vrouw Prinsloo reached the body that lay upon the ground dressed\nin what resembled my clothes, and bending down her stout shape with\nan effort, turned it over. She glared into its face and then began to\nshriek.\n\n\"Come here, Henri Marais,\" she shrieked, \"come, see what your beloved\nnephew has done! You had a daughter who was all your life to you, Henri\nMarais. Well, come, look at her after your beloved nephew has finished\nhis work with her!\"\n\nHenri Marais advanced slowly like one who does not understand. He stood\nover the body on the ground, and looked down upon it through the morning\nmists.\n\nThen suddenly he went mad. His broad hat fell from his head, and his\nlong hair seemed to stand up. Also his beard grew big and bristled like\nthe feathers of a bird in frosty weather. He turned on Hernan Pereira.\n\"You devil!\" he shouted, and his voice sounded like the roar of a wild\nbeast; \"you devil, you have murdered my daughter! Because you could\nnot get Marie for yourself, you have murdered her. Well, I will pay you\nback!\"\n\nWithout more ado he lifted his gun and fired straight at Hernan Pereira,\nwho sank slowly to the ground and lay there groaning.\n\nJust then I grew aware that horsemen were advancing upon us, a great\nnumber of horsemen, though whence they came at that time I did not know.\nOne of these I recognised even in my half-drunken state, for he had\nimpressed himself very vividly upon my mind. He was the dark-browed\ncommandant who had tried and condemned me to death. He dismounted, and,\nstaring at the two figures that lay upon the ground, said in a loud and\nterrible voice:\n\n\"What is this? Who are these men, and why are they shot? Explain, Henri\nMarais.\"\n\n\"Men!\" wailed Henri Marais, \"they are not men. One is a woman--my only\nchild; and the other is a devil, who, being a devil, will not die. See!\nhe will not die. Give me another gun that I may make him die.\"\n\nThe commandant looked about him wildly, and his eye fell upon the Vrouw\nPrinsloo.\n\n\"What has chanced, vrouw?\" he asked.\n\n\"Only this,\" she replied in a voice of unnatural calm. \"Your murderers\nwhom you set on in the name of law and justice have made a mistake. You\ntold them to murder Allan Quatermain for reasons of your own. Well, they\nhave murdered his wife instead.\"\n\nNow the commandant struck his hand upon his forehead and groaned, and I,\nhalf awakened at last, ran forward, shaking my fists and gibbering.\n\n\"Who is that?\" asked the commandant. \"Is it a man or a woman?\"\n\n\"It is a man in woman's clothing; it is Allan Quatermain,\" answered the\nvrouw, \"whom we drugged and tried to hide from your butchers.\"\n\n\"God above us!\" exclaimed the commandant, \"is this earth or hell?\"\n\nThen the wounded Pereira raised himself upon one hand.\n\n\"I am dying,\" he cried; \"my life is bleeding away, but before I die I\nmust speak. All that story I told against the Englishman is false. He\nnever plotted with Dingaan against the Boers. It was I who plotted with\nDingaan. Although I hated him because he found me out, I did not wish\nRetief and our people to be killed. But I did wish Allan Quatermain to\nbe killed, because he had won her whom I loved, though, as it happened,\nall the others were slain, and he alone escaped. Then I came here and\nlearned that Marie was his wife--yes, his wife indeed--and grew mad with\nhate and jealousy. So I bore false witness against him, and, you fools,\nyou believed me and ordered me to shoot him who is innocent before God\nand man. Then things went wrong. The woman tricked me again--for the\nlast time. She dressed herself as the man, and in the dawnlight I was\ndeceived. I killed her, her whom I love alone, and now her father, who\nloved her also, has killed me.\"\n\nBy this time I understood all, for my drugged brain had awakened at\nlast. I ran to the brute upon the ground; grotesque in my woman's\ngarments all awry, I leaped on him and stamped out the last of his life.\nThen, standing over his dead body, I shook my fists and cried:\n\n\"Men, see what you have done. May God pay you back all you owe her and\nme!\"\n\nThey dismounted, they came round me, they protested, they even wept. And\nI, I raved at them upon the one side, while the mad Henri Marais raved\nupon the other; and the Vrouw Prinsloo, waving her big arms, called\ndown the curse of God and the blood of the innocent upon their heads and\nthose of their children for ever.\n\nThen I remember no more.\n\n\nWhen I came to myself two weeks afterwards, for I had been very ill and\nin delirium, I was lying in the house of the Vrouw Prinsloo alone. The\nBoers had all gone, east and west and north and south, and the dead\nwere long buried. They had taken Henri Marais with them, so I was told,\ndragging him away in a bullock cart, to which he was tied, for he was\nraving mad. Afterwards he became quieter, and, indeed, lived for years,\nwalking about and asking all whom he met if they could lead him to\nMarie. But enough of him--poor man, poor man!\n\nThe tale which got about was that Pereira had murdered Marie out of\njealousy, and been shot by her father. But there were so many tragic\nhistories in those days of war and massacre that this particular one was\nsoon quite forgotten, especially as those concerned in it for one reason\nand another did not talk overmuch of its details. Nor did I talk of it,\nsince no vengeance could mend my broken heart.\n\n\nThey brought me a letter that had been found on Marie's breast, stained\nwith her blood.\n\nHere it is:\n\n\n\"MY HUSBAND,\n\n\"Thrice have you saved my life, and now it is my turn to save yours, for\nthere is no other path. It may be that they will kill you afterwards,\nbut if so, I shall be glad to have died first in order that I may be\nready to greet you in the land beyond.\n\n\"I drugged you, Allan, then I cut off my hair and dressed myself in your\nclothes. The Vrouw Prinsloo, Hans and I set my garments upon you. They\nled you out as though you were fainting, and the guards, seeing me, whom\nthey thought was you, standing in the doorway, let them pass without\nquestion.\n\n\"What may happen I do not know, for I write this after you are gone. I\nhope, however, that you will escape and lead some full and happy life,\nthough I fear that its best moments will always be shadowed by memories\nof me. For I know you love me, Allan, and will always love me, as I\nshall always love you.\n\n\"The light is burning out--like mine--so farewell, farewell, farewell!\nAll earthly stories come to an end at last, but at that end we shall\nmeet again. Till then, adieu. Would that I could have done more for you,\nsince to die for one who is loved with body, heart and soul is but a\nlittle thing. Still I have been your wife, Allan, and your wife I shall\nremain when the world is old. Heaven does not grow old, Allan, and there\nI shall greet you.\n\n\"The light is dead, but--oh!--in my heart another light arises!\n\n\"Your MARIE.\"\n\n\nThis was her letter.\n\nI do not think there is anything more to be said.\n\n\nSuch is the history of my first love. Those who read it, if any ever do,\nwill understand why I have never spoken of her before, and do not wish\nit to be known until I, too, am dead and have gone to join the great\nsoul of Marie Marais.\n\n\nALLAN QUATERMAIN.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Marie, by H.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
