The tallest, lean bodied but broad\nshouldered, black of hair and gray of eye, held himself in soldierly\nfashion and gazed unmoved. His two mates--one stocky, red faced and red\nheaded; the other slender, bronzed and blond--betrayed their thoughts in\ntheir blue eyes. The red man squinted quizzically at the smoke feather\nas if it mattered little to him where he was. The blond watched it with\nthe wistfulness of one who sees the last sign of his own world fade out.\n\nBehind them, at a respectful distance, a number of swarthy individuals\nof both sexes in nondescript garments smoked and stared at the trio with\nthe interest always accorded strangers by the dwellers of the Out\nPlaces. They eyed the uncompromising back of the tall one, the easy\nlounge of the red one, the thoughtful attitude of the light one. The\ncopper-faced men peered at the rifles hanging in the right hands of the\nnewcomers, their knee boots, khaki clothing, and wide hats. The women\nlet their eyes rove over the boxes and bundles reposing in the mud\nbeside the three.\n\n\"_Ingles?_\" hazarded a woman, speaking through the stem of the black\npipe clutched in her filed teeth.\n\n\"_Notre-Americano_,\" asserted a man, nodding toward the broad hats.\n\"Englishmen would wear the round helmets of pith.\"\n\n\"_Mercadores?_ Traders?\" suggested the woman, hopefully running an eye\nagain over the bundles.\n\n\"_Exploradores_,\" the man corrected. \"Explorers of the bush. Have you no\neyes? Do you not see the guns and high boots?\"\n\nThe woman subsided. The others continued what seemed to be their only\noccupation--smoking.\n\nThe smoke streamer in the north vanished. As if moved by the same\nimpulse, the three strangers turned their heads and looked\nsouth-westward, upriver. The red-haired man spoke.\n\n\"So we've lit at last, as the feller said when him and his airyplane\nlanded in a sewer. Faith, I dunno but he was better off than us, at\nthat--he wasn't two thousand miles from nowheres like we are. The\nsteamer's gone, and us three pore li'l' boys are left a long ways from\nhome.\"\n\nThen, assuming the tone of a showman, he went on:\n\n\"Before ye, girls, ye see the well known Ja-va-ree River, which I never\nseen before and comes from gosh-knows-where and ends in the Ammyzon.\nOver there on t'other side the water is Peru. Yer feet are in the mud of\nBrazil. This other river to yer left is the Tickywahoo--\"\n\n\"Tecuahy,\" the blond man corrected, grinning.\n\n\"Yeah. And behind ye is the last town in the world and the place that\nGod forgot. What d'ye call this here, now, city?\"\n\n\"Remate de Males. Which means 'Culmination of Evils.'\"\n\n\"Yeah. It looks it. Wonder if it's anything like Hell's Kitchen, up in\nli'l' old N'Yawk.\"\n\nThey turned and looked dubiously at the town--a row of perhaps seventy\niron-walled and palm-roofed houses set on high palm-trunk poles, each\nwith its ladder dropping from the doorway to the one muddy street. Then\nspoke the tall man.\n\n\"Before you see it again, Tim, you'll think it's quite a town. Above\nhere is nothing but a few rubber estates, seven hundred miles of unknown\nriver, and empty jungle.\"\n\n\"Empty, huh? Then they kidded us on the boat. From what they said it's\nfair crawlin' with snakes and jaggers and lizards and bloody vampires\nand spiders as big as yer fist. And the water is full o' man-eatin' fish\nand the bush full o' man-eatin' Injuns. If that's what ye call empty,\nCap, don't take me no place where it's crowded.\"\n\nA slight smile twitched the set lips of the tall \"cap.\"\n\n\"They're all here, Tim, though maybe not so thick as you expect. Lots of\nother things too. Who's this?\"\n\nThrough the knot of pipe-puffing idlers came a portly coppery man in\nuniform.\n\n\"Well, I'll be--Say, he's the same chap who came onto the boat in a\npolice uniform. Now he's in army rig,\" the light-haired member of the\ntrio exclaimed. \"O Lordy! I've got it! He's the police force and the\narmy! The whole blooming works! Ha!\"\n\nTim snickered and stepped forward.\n\n\"Hullo, buddy!\" he greeted. \"What's on yer mind?\"\n\n\"_Boa dia_, senhor,\" responded the official, affably. With the words he\ndeftly slipped an arm around Tim's waist and lifted the other hand\ntoward his shoulder. But that hand stopped short, then flew wildly out\ninto the air.\n\nTim gave a grunt and a heave. The official went skidding and slithering\nsix feet through the mud, clutching at nothing and contorting himself in\na frantic effort to keep from sprawling in the muck. By a margin thin as\nan eyelash he succeeded in preserving his balance and stood where he\nstopped, amazement and anger in his face.\n\n\"Lay off that stuff!\" growled Tim, head forward and jaw out. \"If ye want\ntrouble come and git it like a man, not sneak up with a grin and then\nclinch. Don't reach for no knife, now, or I'll drill ye--\"\n\n\"Tim!\" barked the black-haired one. \"Ten-_shun_!\"\n\nAutomatically Tim's head snapped erect and his shoulders went back. He\nrelaxed again almost at once. But in the meantime the tall man had\nstepped forward and faced the raging representative of the government of\nBrazil.\n\n\"Pardon, comrade,\" he said with an engaging smile. \"My friend is a\nstranger to Brazil and not acquainted with your manner of welcome. In\nour own country men never put the arm around one another except in\ncombat. He has been a soldier. You are a soldier. So you can understand\nthat a fighting man may be a little abrupt when he does not understand.\"\n\nThe smile, the apology, and most of all the subtle flattery of being\ntreated as an equal by a man whose manner betokened the North American\narmy officer, mollified the aggrieved official at once. The hot gleam\ndied out of his eyes. Punctiliously he saluted. The salute was as\npunctiliously returned.\n\n\"It is forgotten, Capitao. As the capitao says, we soldiers are\nsometimes overquick. I come to give you welcome to Remate de Males. My\nservices are at your disposal.\"\n\n\"We thank you. Why do you call me capitao?\"\n\n\"My eyes know a capitao when they see him.\"\n\n\"But this is not a military expedition, my friend. Nor are any of us\nsoldiers now--though we all have been.\"\n\n\"Once a capitao, always a capitao,\" the Brazilian insisted. Then he\nhinted: \"If the capitao and his friends wish to call upon the\nsuperintendente they will find him in the intendencia, the blue building\nbeyond the hotel. It will soon be closed for the day.\"\n\nThe tall American's keen gray eyes roved down the street to the\nweather-beaten house whose peeling walls once might have been blue. He\nnodded shortly.\n\n\"Better go down there,\" he said. \"Come on, Merry. Tim, stick here and\nkeep an eye on the stuff. And don't start another war while we're gone.\"\n\n\"Right, Cap.\" Tim deftly swung his rifle to his right shoulder. \"I'll\nwalk me post in a military manner, keepin' always on the alert and\nobservin' everything that takes place within sight or hearin', accordin'\nto Gin'ral Order Number Two. There won't be no war unless somebody\nstarts somethin'. Hey, there, buddy, would ye smoke a God's-country\ncigarette if I give ye one?\"\n\n\"_Si_,\" grinned the soldier-policeman, all animosity gone. And as the\nother two men tramped away through the mud they also grinned, looking\nback at the North and the South American pacing side by side in\nsentry-go, blowing smoke and conversing like brothers in arms.\n\n\"Tim likes to remember his 'general orders,' but he's forgotten Number\nFive,\" laughed the blond man.\n\n\"Five? 'To talk to no one except in line of duty.' Don't need it here,\nMerry.\"\n\n\"Nope. The _entente cordiale_ is the thing. Here's hoping nobody makes\nTim remember his 'Gin'ral Order Number Thirteen' while we're gone, Rod.\"\n\nHe of the black hair smiled again as his mate, mimicking Tim's gruff\nvoice, quoted:\n\n\"'Gin'ral Order Number Thirteen: In case o' doubt, bust the other guy\nquick.'\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nAT SUNDOWN\n\n\nPast the loungers in the street, past others in the doorways, past\nchildren and dogs and goats, the pair marched briskly to the faded blue\nhouse whence the federal superintendent ruled the town with tropic\nindolence. There they found a thin, fever-worn, gravely courteous\ngentleman awaiting them.\n\n\"Sit, senhores,\" he urged, with a languid wave of the hand toward\nchairs. \"I am honored by your visit, as is all Remate de Males. In what\nway can I serve you?\"\n\nThe blond answered:\n\n\"We have come, sir, both for the pleasure of making your acquaintance\nand for a little information. First permit me to introduce my friend Mr.\nRoderick McKay, lately a captain in the United States army. I am\nMeredith Knowlton. There is a third member of our party, Mr. Timothy\nRyan, who remained on the river bank to talk with--er--a soldier of\nBrazil.\"\n\nThe federal official nodded, a slight smile in his eyes.\n\n\"We are here ostensibly for exploration,\" Knowlton continued, candidly,\n\"but actually to find a certain man. I think it quite probable that we\nshall have to do considerable exploring before finding him.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" the other murmured, shrewdly. \"It is a matter of police work,\nperhaps?\"\n\n\"No--and yes. The man we seek is not wanted by the law, and yet he is.\nHe has committed no crime, and so cannot be arrested. But the law wants\nhim badly because the settlement of a certain big estate hinges upon the\nquestion of whether he is alive or dead. If alive, he is heir to more\nthan a million. If not--the money goes elsewhere.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" repeated the official, thoughtfully.\n\n\"I might add,\" McKay broke in with a touch of stiffness, \"that neither I\nnor either of my companions would profit in any way by this man's death.\nQuite the contrary.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" reiterated the other, his face clearing. \"You are commissioned,\nperhaps, to find and produce this man.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Knowlton nodded. \"From our own financial standpoint he is\nworth much more alive than dead. On the other hand, any absolute proof\nof his death--proof which would stand in a court of law--is worth\nsomething also. Our task is to produce either the man himself or\nindisputable proof that he no longer lives.\n\n\"The man's name is David Dawson Rand. If alive, he now is thirty-three\nyears old. Height five feet nine. Weight about one hundred sixty. Hair\ndark, though not black. Eyes grayish green. Chief distinguishing marks\nare the green eyes, a broken nose--caused by being struck in the face by\na baseball--and a patch of snow-white hair the size of a thumb ball, two\ninches above the left ear. Accustomed to having his own way, not at all\nconsiderate of others. Yet not a bad fellow as men go--merely a man\nspoiled by too much mothering in boyhood and by the fact that he never\nhad to work. This is he.\"\n\nFrom a breast pocket he drew a small grain-leather notebook, from which\nhe extracted an unmounted photograph. The superintendent looked into the\npictured face of a full-cheeked, wide-mouthed, square-jawed man with a\nslightly blas\u00e9 expression and a half-cynical smile. After studying it a\nminute he nodded and handed it back.\n\n\"As you say, senhor, a man who never has had to work.\"\n\n\"Exactly. For five years this man has been regarded as dead. It was his\nhabit to start off suddenly for any place where his whims drew him,\nnotifying nobody of his departure. But a few days later he would always\nwrite, cable, or telegraph his relatives, so that his general\nwhereabouts would soon become known. On his last trip he sent a radio\nmessage from a steamer, out at sea, saying he was bound for Rio Janeiro.\nThat was the last ever heard from him.\"\n\n\"Rio is far from here,\" suggested the Brazilian.\n\n\"Just so. We look for Rand at the headwaters of the Amazon, instead of\nin Rio, because Rio yields no clew and because of one other thing which\nI shall speak of presently.\n\n\"It has been learned that he reached Rio safely, but there his trail\nended. As he had several thousand dollars on his person, it was\nconcluded that he was murdered for his money and his body disposed of.\nThis belief has been held until quite recently, when a new book of\ntravel was published--_The Mother of Waters_, by Dwight Dexter, an\nexplorer of considerable reputation.\"\n\nThe Brazilian's brows lifted.\n\n\"Senhor Dexter? I remember Senhor Dexter. He stopped here for a short\ntime, ill with fever. So he has published a book?\"\n\n\"Yes. It deals mainly with his travels and observations in Peru, along\nthe Mara\u00f1on, Huallaga, and Ucayali. But it includes a short chapter\nregarding the Javary, and in that chapter occurs the following, which I\nhave copied verbatim.\"\n\nFrom the notebook he read:\n\n\"'It falls to the lot of the explorer at times to meet not only hitherto\nunclassified species of fauna and flora, but also strange specimens of\nthe _genus homo_. Such a creature came suddenly upon my camp one day\njust before a serious and well-nigh fatal attack of fever compelled me\nto relinquish my intention to proceed farther up the Javary.\n\n\"'While my Indian cook was preparing the afternoon meal, out from the\ndense jungle strode a bearded, shaggy-haired, painted white man, totally\nnude save for a narrow breechclout and a quiver containing several long\nhunting arrows. In one hand he carried a strong bow of really excellent\nworkmanship. This was his only weapon. He wore no ornament, unless\nstreaks of brilliant red paint be considered ornaments. He was wild and\nsavage in appearance and manner as any cannibal Indian. Yet he was\nindubitably white.\n\n\"'To my somewhat startled greeting he made no response. Neither did he\nspeak at any time during his unceremonious visit. Bolt upright, he stood\nbeside my crude table until the Indian stolidly brought in my food.\nThen, without a by-your-leave, the wild man rapidly wolfed down the\nentire meal, feeding himself with one hand and holding his bow ready in\nthe other. Though I questioned him and sought to draw him into\nconversation, he honored me with not so much as a grunt or a gesture.\nWhen the table was bare he stalked out again and vanished into the dim\nforest.\n\n\"'After he had gone my Indian urged that we leave the place at once. The\nman, he said, was \"The Raposa\"--a word which denotes a species of wild\ndog sometimes found on the upper Amazon. He knew nothing of this\n\"Raposa\" except that he apparently belonged to a wild tribe living far\nback in the forest, perhaps allied with the cannibal Mayorunas, who were\nvery fierce; and that he appeared sometimes at Indian settlements,\nwhere, without ever speaking, he would help himself to the best food and\nthen leave. My man seemed to fear that now some great misfortune would\ncome to us unless we shifted our base. When the fever came upon me soon\nafterward, the superstitious fellow was convinced that the illness was\nattributable directly to the visit of the human \"wild dog.\"\n\n\"'Aside from the nudity and barbarism of the mysterious stranger,\ncertain personal peculiarities struck me. One was that his eyes were\ngreen. Another was a streak of snow-white hair above one ear.\nFurthermore, the red paint on his body outlined his skeleton. His ribs,\nspine, arm- and leg-bones all were portrayed on his tanned skin by those\nbrilliant red streaks. In this connection my Indian asserted that in the\ntribe to which \"The Raposa\" probably belonged it was the custom to\npreserve the bones of the dead and to paint them with this same red dye,\nafter which the bones were hung up in the huts of the deceased instead\nof being given burial. Beyond this my informant knew nothing of the \"Red\nBone\" people, except that to enter their country was death.'\"\n\nKnowlton returned the book to his pocket and carefully buttoned the\nflap.\n\n\"When that appeared,\" he continued, \"efforts were made to get hold of\nDexter, with the idea of showing him the photograph of the missing man\nand learning any additional details. Unfortunately, by the time the book\nwas published Dexter had gone to Africa to seek a race of dwarfs said to\nexist in the Igidi Desert, and thus was totally out of reach. Then we\nwere called upon to follow up this clew and find the Raposa if possible.\nMen with green eyes and patches of white hair above one ear are not\ncommon. So, though our knowledge of this strange wild man is confined to\nthose few words of Dexter's, we are here to learn more of him and to get\nhim if we can.\"\n\nHe looked expectantly at the official. The latter, after staring out\nthrough the doorway for a time, shook his head slightly.\n\n\"Something of this Raposa and of those red-streaked people has come to\nmy ears, senhores, but only as rumors,\" he said, slowly. \"And one does\nnot place great faith in rumors. Yet I have repeatedly been surprised to\nlearn, after dismissing a story as an empty Indian tale, that the tale\nwas true.\n\n\"Of the Mayorunas more is known. They are eaters of human flesh,\ninhabiting both sides of the Javary, deadly when angered, and very\neasily angered. Their country is not many days distant from here, but as\nthey never attack us we do not attack them. It is an armed neutrality,\nas you senhores would say. True, we have to be careful in drinking\nwater, for they sometimes poison the streams against real or imaginary\nenemies, and the poisoned waters flow down to us, causing those who\ndrink it to die of a fever like the typhoid. Yet,\" and he smiled, \"there\nis a saying, is there not, that water is made not to drink, but to bathe\nin?\"\n\nKnowlton laughed. McKay's eyes twinkled.\n\n\"I'm sorry to say that water's about all a fellow can get to drink in\nthe States now,\" the blond man said, ruefully. \"That is, of course,\nunless a man knows where to go.\"\n\n\"_Si._ It is a pity. But here in Brazil one need not drink water unless\nhe wishes, and often it is better not to. Of the Mayorunas, senhor--you\ndo not intend to go among them, seeking this wild man of the red bones?\nIf you should do so it would be a matter of regret to me.\"\n\n\"Meaning that we should not come out again? That's a risk we have to\nface. We go wherever it is necessary.\"\n\n\"I am sorry. I regret also that I can give you no definite information.\nYet I wish you all success, senhores, and a safe return. This much I can\ndo and gladly will do: I can send word to another white man who now is\nin the town and who knows much of the upper river. He may be able to\nassist you, and without doubt will be eager to do so. He is staying at\nthe hotel, just below here--Senhor Schwandorf.\"\n\nThe eyes of the two Americans narrowed. The official coughed.\n\n\"Senhor McKay has been a soldier. And Senhor Knowlton--\"\n\n\"I was a lieutenant.\"\n\n\"Ah! But the war has passed, senhores. Senhor Schwandorf was not a\nsoldier of Germany--he has been in Brazil for more than six years.\"\n\n\"War's over. That's right,\" McKay agreed. \"But don't bother to send\nword. We'll find him if he's at the hotel. Going there ourselves. Glad\nto have met you, sir. Good luck!\"\n\n\"And to you also luck, Capitao and Tenente,\" smiled the official. McKay\nand Knowlton strode out.\n\n\"Guess this is the hotel,\" hazarded McKay, glancing at a house which\nrose slightly above the others. \"I'll go in and charter rooms. You get\nTim and have somebody rustle our impedimenta up here.\"\n\nHe turned aside. Knowlton trudged on through the glare of sunset to the\nriver bank where Tim and the army of Remate de Males still loafed up and\ndown, the admired of all beholders.\n\n\"All right, Tim. We're moving to the hotel. No more war, I see.\"\n\n\"Lord love ye, no,\" grinned Tim. \"Me and this feller are gittin' on\nfine. He's Joey--I forgit the rest of his names; he's got about a dozen\nmore and they sound like stones rattlin' around inside a can. But Joey's\na right guy. After me tour o' duty ends he's goin' to buy me a drink and\nmaybe introjuce me to a lady friend o' his. Want to join the party,\nLooey?\"\n\n\"Not unless the ladies are better looking than these,\" laughed the\nex-lieutenant, moving his head toward the pipe-smoking females.\n\n\"Faith, I was thinkin' that same meself. Unless he can dig up somethin'\nfancier 'n what I see so far, I'd as soon have Mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle of Armenti\u00e8res. Sure, ye know that one, Looey. Goes to the\ntune o' 'Parley-Voo.'\"\n\nWherewith he lifted up a foghorn voice and, much to the edification of\n\"Joey\" (whose name really was Joao) and the rest of Remate de Males,\nburst into song:\n\n    \"Mademoiselle of Armenteers,\n        Pa-a-arley-voo!\n    She smoked our butts and bummed our beers,\n        Pa-a-arley-voo!\n    She had cockeyes and jackass ears\n    And she hadn't been kissed for forty years,\n        Rinkydinky-parley-voo!\"\n\nAs his musical effort ended, out from the dense jungle hemming in the\ntown burst a hideous roaring howl. Again and again it sounded in a\nhorrible crash of noise.\n\n\"Holy Saint Pat!\" gasped Tim, throwing his rifle to port and bracing his\nfeet. \"Now look what I went and done! Is that the echo, or a couple\ndozen jaggers all fightin' to oncet?\"\n\n\"Guariba, Senhor Ree-ann,\" snickered Joao. \"Not jaguars--no. Only one\nlittle guariba monkey. The howler.\"\n\n\"G'wan! Ye're kiddin'!\"\n\n\"But no, _amigo_. It is as I tell you. One monkey. It is sunset, and the\njungle awakes.\"\n\n\"My gosh! I'll say it does. Sounds like a Sat'day night row in a Second\nAv'noo saloon, except there ain't no shootin'. Guess you boys have some\nnight life, too, even if ye are away back in the bush.\"\n\n\"Time for us to move, Tim,\" laughed Knowlton. \"It'll be dark in no time.\nJoao, will you have our baggage moved to the hotel?\"\n\n\"_Si_, senhor. _Immediatamente._ Antonio--Jorge--Rosario! And you, too,\nMeldo--_vem c\u00e0_! Carry the bundles of the gentlemen to the hotel,\npresto! Proceed, senhores. I, Joao d'Almeida Magalhaes Nabuco Pestana da\nFonseca, will remain here on guard until all your possessions have been\ntransported. Proceed without fear.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTHE VOICE OF THE WILDS\n\n\nMcKay, eyes twinkling again, awaited them at the top of the hotel's\nstreet ladder.\n\n\"Rooms any good, Rod?\" hailed Knowlton.\n\n\"Best in the house, Merry.\"\n\n\"See any insects in the beds?\"\n\n\"Nary a bug--in the beds.\" The twinkle grew. \"Didn't look in the bureaus\nor behind the mirrors. Come look 'em over.\"\n\nEntering a sizable room evidently used for dining--for its chief\narticles of furniture were two tables made from planed palm\ntrunks--McKay waved a hand toward a row of four doorways on the right.\n\n\"First three are ours,\" he explained. \"Only vacancies here. Eight rooms\nin this hotel--the other four over there.\" He pointed across the room,\non the other side of which opened four similar doors. \"They're occupied\nby two sick men, one drunk--hear him snore?--and one she-goat which is\nkidding.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Tim snorted, suspiciously. \"I think ye're the one that's kiddin',\nCap.\"\n\n\"Not a bit. I looked. The last room on this side is the Dutchman's, and\nthese are ours. Take your pick. They're all alike.\"\n\nKnowlton stepped to the nearest and looked in. For a moment he said no\nword. Then he softly muttered:\n\n\"Well, I'll be spread-eagled!\"\n\n\"Me, too,\" seconded Tim, who had been craning his neck.\n\nThe room was absolutely empty. No bed, no chair, no bureau, no\nrug--nothing at all was in it except two iron hooks. Its floor consisted\nof split palm logs, round side up, between which opened inch-wide\nspaces. Its walls were rusty corrugated iron, guiltless of mirrors or\npictures, which did not reach to the roof.\n\n\"Observe the excellent ventilation,\" grinned McKay. \"Wind blows up\nthrough the floor--if there is any wind--and then loops over the\npartition into the next fellow's room.\"\n\n\"Yeah. And I'll say any guy that drops his collar button is out o' luck.\nIt goes plunk into the mud, seven foot down under the house. But say,\nCap, how the heck do we sleep? Hang ourselves up on them hooks?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"Kind o' rough on a feller's shirt, ain't it? And the shirt would likely\npull off over yer head before mornin'.\"\n\n\"Yes, probably would. But the secret is this--you're supposed to hang\nyour hammock on those hooks. You provide the hammock. The hotel provides\nthe hooks. What more can you ask of a modern hotel?\"\n\n\"Huh! And if a guy wants a bath, there's the river, all full o' 'gators\nand cattawampuses and things. And if ye eat, I s'pose ye rustle yer own\ngrub and pay for eatin' it off that slab table there. There's jest one\nthing ye can say for this dump--a feller can spit on the floor. But with\nall them cracks in it he might not hit it, at that. Mother of mine! To\nthink Missus Ryan's li'l' boy should ever git caught stayin' in a hole\nlike this, along o' drunks and skiddin' she-goats and--did ye say a\nDutchman?\"\n\n\"German. Chap named Schwandorf.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\" Tim's tone was sinister. \"Say, Cap, gimme the room next that\nguy. And if ye hear anybody yowlin' before mornin' don't git worried. It\nwon't be me.\"\n\n\"None of that, Tim,\" warned Knowlton. \"The war's over--\"\n\n\"Since when? There wasn't no peace treaty signed when we left the\nStates.\"\n\n\"Er--ahum! Well, technically you're right. But this fellow may be useful\nto us. He knows the upper river, they say.\"\n\n\"Aw, well, if ye can use him I'll lay off him. Where is he?\"\n\n\"Out somewhere,\" answered McKay. \"I haven't seen him yet. Want this\nfirst room, Merry?\"\n\n\"Just to play safe, I'll take the one next the German. And if I hear any\nwar in the night, Tim, I'm coming over the top with both hands going.\"\n\n\"Grrrumph!\" growled Tim.\n\n\"That goes, Tim,\" warned McKay. \"I'll take this room and you can have\nthe one between us. Here comes the baggage train with our stuff. In\nhere, men!\"\n\nPuffing and grunting, Antonio and Jorge and Rosario and Meldo shuffled\nin with the boxes and bundles. Under the directions of McKay and\nKnowlton, these were stowed in the bare rooms. Then the four shuffled\nout again, grinning happily over a small roll of Brazilian paper reis\nwhich McKay had peeled from a much larger roll and handed to them.\nImmediately following their departure, in came a youth carrying three\nnew hammocks.\n\n\"Our beds,\" McKay explained. \"I sent this lad to a trader's store for\nthem. He's the proprietor's son. Thank you, Thomaz. Tell your father to\nput these on our bill, and take for yourself this small token of our\nappreciation.\"\n\nMore reis changed hands. The young Brazilian, with a flash of teeth,\ninformed them that the evening meal would soon be ready and disappeared\nthrough a rear door.\n\n\"Do they really feed us at this here, now, hotel?\" Tim demanded. \"Then\nthe goat's safe.\"\n\n\"Meaning?\" puzzled Knowlton.\n\n\"Meanin' I didn't know but we had to kill our supper, and I was goin' to\ngit the cap'n's goat. That is, the goat the cap'n's kiddin'--I mean the\ngoat that's kiddin' the cap--the skiddin' she-goat--Aw, rats! ye know\nwhat I'm drivin' at. Me tongue so dry it don't work right.\"\n\nWherewith Tim retreated in disorder to his room and began wrestling with\nhis new hammock and the iron hooks.\n\nSwift darkness filled the rooms. The sun had slid down below the bulge\nof the fast-rolling world. Thomaz re-entered, lit candles stuck in empty\nbottles, and, with a bow, placed one of these crude illuminants at the\ndoor of each of the strangers. By the flickering lights McKay and\nKnowlton disposed their effects according to their individual desires,\nbearing in mind Tim's observation that any small article dropped on the\nfloor would land in the mud under the house, whence sounded the grunts\nof pigs. Their work was soon completed, and they sauntered together to\nthe small piazza.\n\n\"Nice quiet little place,\" commented Knowlton. \"Make a good sanitarium\nfor nervous folks.\"\n\nThe comment was made in a tone which, in the daytime, would carry half a\nmile. McKay nodded to save a similar effort. The outbreak of the howling\nmonkey which so startled Tim had been only the first note of the night\nconcert of the jungle. Now that the sun was gone the chorus was in full\nswing.\n\nBeasts of the village, the jungle, the river, all hurled their voices\ninto the uproar. From the gloom around the houses rose the bellowing of\ncows and calves, the howls and yelps of dogs, the yowling of cats, the\ngrunts and squeals of hogs. In the black river, flowing past within a\nstone's throw of the hotel door, sounded the loud snorts of dolphins and\nthe hideous night call of the foul beast of the mud--the alligator. Out\nfrom the matted tangle of trees and brush and great snakelike vines\nbehind the town rolled the appalling roars of guaribas, raucous bird\ncalls, dismal hoots, sudden scattered screams. And over all, whelming\nall other sound by the sheer might of its penetrating power, throbbed\nthe rapid-fire hammering of millions of frogs.\n\n\"Frogs sound like a machine-gun barrage,\" the blond man added.\n\n\"Or thousands of riveting hammers pounding steel.\"\n\n\"Queer how much worse it is when you're right in it. We've heard it all\nthe way up two thousand miles of Amazon, but--\"\n\n\"But you're right beside the orchestra now. Position is everything in\nlife.\"\n\nThe double-edged jest made Knowlton glance sidelong at his mate. Of the\ntall, eagle-faced Scot's past he knew little beyond what he had seen of\nhim in war, where he had met him and learned to respect him\nwhole-heartedly. From occasional remarks he had learned that McKay had\nbeen in all sorts of places between Buenos Aires and Nome; and from a\nfew intangible hints he suspected that his \"position in life\" had once\nbeen much higher socially than at present. But he asked no questions.\n\n\"Some orchestra, all right,\" he responded, casually. \"Plenty of jazz.\nIt'll quiet down after a while.\"\n\nFor a time they stood leaning against the wall, staring abstractedly out\nat the dark. One by one the domestic animals ceased their clamor and\nsettled themselves for the night. The jungle din, too, seemed to\ndiminish, though perhaps this was because the ears of the men had become\naccustomed to it. At length through the discordant symphony boomed the\nvoice of Tim.\n\n\"By cripes! I know now what folks mean when they talk about a howlin'\nwilderness. Always thought 'twas one o' them figgers o' speech, but I'll\ntell the world it ain't no joke! Gosh! Think of all the things that's\nlayin' out there and bellerin' and waitin' for us pore li'l' fellers to\ncome in amongst 'em and git et up.\"\n\n\"You'll find the same things in the cities up home,\" said Knowlton, a\nbit cynically. \"Different bodies and different methods of attack, but\nthe same merciless animals under the skin. Snakes in silk\nsuits--foul-mouthed alligators in dinner jackets--hunting-cats and\nvampires, painted and powdered--and all the rest of it.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Ye said a mouthful, Looey. But say, Tommy's shovin' some grub on\nthe table. Mebbe we better hop to it before the flies git it all.\"\n\nAfter a glance at the vicious attack already begun by the aforesaid\nflies, the pair adopted Tim's suggestion and hopped to it. Manfully they\nassailed the rubbery jerked beef, black beans, rice, farinha, and thick,\nblack, unsweetened coffee which comprised the meal. All three were\nwrestling with chunks of the meat when Tim, facing the door, stopped\nchewing long enough to mutter:\n\n\"Dutchland overalls. Here's the goose stepper.\"\n\nThe heads of the other two involuntarily moved a little. Then their\nnecks stiffened and they continued eating. Tim alone stared straight at\na burly, black-whiskered Teuton who had halted in the outer doorway. And\nTim alone saw the ugly look crossing the newcomer's visage as he gazed\nat the khaki shirts, the broad shoulders under them, and the\nunmistakably Irish--and hostile--face of Tim himself.\n\nCatching the hard stare of the red-haired man, he of the black beard\nadvanced at once, his eyes veering to the door of his own room. Straight\nto that room he marched with heavy tread. He opened the door with a\nkick, shut it behind him with a slam. The three at the table glanced at\none another.\n\n\"Say what ye like,\" grumbled Tim, \"but me and that guy don't hold no\nmush party. I don't like his map. I don't like his manners. And he looks\ntoo much like the Fritz that shot me in the back with a kamerad gun\nafter surrenderin'. I was in hospital three months. D'ye mind that time,\nLooey?\"\n\nKnowlton nodded. He remembered also that Tim, shot down from behind and\nalmost killed, had reeled up to his feet and bayoneted his man before\nfalling the second time. Wherefore he replied:\n\n\"He isn't the same one, Tim.\"\n\n\"Nope,\" grimly. \"That one won't never come back. All the same, if you\ngents want to chew the fat with this feller I'm goin' slummin' with me\nfriend Joey Mouthgargle Nabisco Whoozis. Then I won't be round here to\nmake no sour-caustic remarks and gum up yer party.\"\n\n\"Might be a good idea,\" McKay conceded.\n\n\"There he is now, the li'l' darlin'! Hullo, Joey, old sock! Stick around\na minute while I scoop a few more beans. Be with ye toot\nsweet--vite--presto--P.D.Q.\"\n\nWherewith he demolished the rest of his meal with military dispatch,\nproceeded doorward, smote the grinning army of Remate de Males a buffet\non the shoulder, and vanished into the night. A moment later his\nstentorian voice rolled back through the nocturnal racket in an\nimpromptu paraphrase of an old and highly improper army song:\n\n    \"We're in the jungle now,\n    We ain't behind the plow;\n      We'll never git rich,\n      We'll die with the itch.\n    We're in the jungle now!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nTHE GERMAN\n\n\nThe door of the German's room opened. The German came out and marched to\nthe table. Two paces away he halted and faced the Americans, ready to\nspeak if spoken to, equally ready to sit and ignore them if not greeted.\nMcKay and Knowlton rose.\n\n\"Herr von Schwandorf?\" inquired Knowlton.\n\n\"Schwandorf. Neither Herr nor von. Plain Schwandorf.\"\n\nThe reply came in excellent English, though with a slight throaty\naccent.\n\n\"Knowlton is my name. Mr. McKay. The third member of our party, Mr.\nRyan, has just left.\"\n\nSchwandorf bowed stiffly from the waist.\n\n\"It is a pleasure to meet you. White men are all too few here.\"\n\nSeating himself at a place beyond that just vacated by Tim, he\ncontinued, \"You stay here for a time?\"\n\n\"Not long.\" They reseated themselves. \"We go up the river as soon as we\ncan arrange transportation.\"\n\nThe black brows lifted slightly.\n\n\"It is a dangerous river. You would do well to travel elsewhere unless\nyou have some pressing reason to explore this stream.\"\n\nWith an accustomed sweep of the hand he shooed the flies from the bean\ndish and helped himself to a big portion. Over the legumes he poured\nfarinha in the Brazilian fashion.\n\n\"We have. We are seeking a tribe of people who paint their bones red.\"\n\nSchwandorf's hand, conveying the first mouthful of beans upward, stopped\nin air. His black eyes fixed the Americans with an astounded stare. He\nlowered the beans, stabbed absently at a chunk of beef, sawed it apart,\npopped a piece of it into his mouth, and sat for a time chewing. When\nthe meat was down he spoke bluntly:\n\n\"Are there not ways enough to kill yourselves at home instead of\ntraveling to this place to do it?\"\n\nMcKay smiled. The directness of the man amused him.\n\n\"As bad as that?\" asked Knowlton.\n\n\"As bad as that. Blow your head off if you like. Cut your throat. Take\npoison. Jump into the river among the alligators. Step on a snake. But\nkeep away from the Red Bones.\"\n\n\"Why?\" shot McKay.\n\n\"Cannibals--and worse.\"\n\n\"Worse?\"\n\n\"Truly. Most of the Brazilian savages do not torture. The Red Bones do.\"\n\n\"Pleasant prospect.\"\n\n\"Very. Nothing to be gained among them, either. If you're hunting gold,\ntry the hills over west of the Huallaga. None here.\"\n\nKnowlton filled and lit a pipe. McKay slowly drank the last of his\nsyrupy coffee and rolled a cigarette. Schwandorf continued shoveling\nfood into his capacious mouth.\n\n\"Know anything about the Raposa?\" Knowlton asked.\n\nThe Teuton's eyelashes flickered. He ground another chunk of meat\nbetween his jaws before answering.\n\n\"Of course,\" he said then. \"Wild dog. Sharp snout, gray hair, bushy\ntail. I've shot a couple of them.\"\n\n\"This one is a man. Green eyes, streak of white hair over the left ear.\nPaints himself like the Red Bones, as you call them, but is a white\nman.\"\n\n\"Oh! That one? Heard of him, yes. Wild man of the jungle. Want to catch\nhim and put him in a circus?\"\n\n\"Maybe. We'd like to see him, anyhow. Heard about him awhile ago. Any\nway to get him that you know of?\"\n\n\"Might try a steel trap,\" the German suggested, callously. \"But I don't\nknow where you'd set it. Best way to get a wild dog is to shoot him, and\nhe isn't much good dead. Or would this one be worth something--dead?\" A\nswift sidelong glance accompanied the question.\n\n\"Not a cent!\" snapped McKay.\n\n\"And perhaps he'd be worth nothing alive,\" added Knowlton. \"But we have\na healthy curiosity to look him over. Guess the Red Bone country would\nbe the likeliest place. How far is it from here?\"\n\n\"Keep out of it,\" was the stubborn reply.\n\nThe Americans rose.\n\n\"We are not going to keep out of it,\" Knowlton declared, coldly. \"We are\ngoing straight into it. Thank you for your assistance.\"\n\n\"Not so fast,\" Schwandorf protested. \"If you are determined to go I will\nhelp you if I can. Shall we sit on the piazza with a small bottle to aid\ndigestion? So! Thomaz! Bring from my stock the k\u00fcmmel. Or would you\nprefer whisky, gentlemen?\"\n\n\"Ginger-ale highballs are my favorite fruit,\" admitted Knowlton. \"Can\nginger ale be bought here?\"\n\n\"Indeed yes. At one milrei a bottle.\"\n\n\"Cheap enough. Thomaz, three bottles of ginger ale and one of North\nAmerican whisky--the best. Cigars also. Out on the piazza.\"\n\n\"Si, senhores.\"\n\nSchwandorf got up.\n\n\"If you will pardon me, I will drink my k\u00fcmmel. Frankly, I do not like\nwhisky.\"\n\n\"And frankly, we do not like k\u00fcmmel. All a matter of taste.\"\n\n\"Truly. So let each of us drink his own preference. I will join you in a\nmoment.\"\n\nThe Americans sauntered to the door, while the German strode into his\nroom.\n\n\"Blunt sort of cuss,\" Knowlton commented.\n\n\"Ay, blunt. But not candid. Knows more than he's telling.\"\n\nDisposing themselves comfortably, they sat watching the lights of the\ntown and the jungle--the first pouring from windows and open doors, the\nlatter streaking across the darkness where the big fire beetles of the\ntropics winged their way. As Knowlton had predicted, the night noise of\nforest and stream had diminished; but now from the village itself rose a\nnew discord--a babel of vocal and instrumental efforts at music\nemanating from the badly worn records of dozens of cheap phonographs\ngrinding away in the stilt-poled huts.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" groaned McKay. \"Even here at the end of the world one can't\nget away from those beastly instruments.\"\n\nA throaty chuckle from the doorway followed the words. Schwandorf\nemerged, carrying a big bottle.\n\n\"Yet there is one thing to be thankful for, gentlemen,\" he said. \"In all\nthis town there is not one man who attempts to play a trombone.\"\n\nThe others laughed. Thomaz appeared with bottles and thick cups. Corks\nwere drawn, liquids gurgled, matches flared, cigars glowed. Without\nwarning Schwandorf shot a question through the gloom:\n\n\"Have you seen Cabral--the superintendent?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Ask him about the wild man?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Get any information?\"\n\n\"Nothing definite. He suggested that we see you.\"\n\n\"So.\"\n\nA pause, while Schwandorf's cigar end glowed like a flaming eye.\n\n\"The Red Bones live well up the river,\" he began, abruptly. \"Twenty-four\ndays by canoe, five days through the bush on the east shore. That would\nbring you to their main settlement--if you were not wiped out before\nthen. They're a big tribe, as tribes go. Ever been here before?\"\n\n\"No. Not here,\" Knowlton told him. \"I've been in Rio, and McKay here has\nknocked around in--\"\n\nA stealthy kick from McKay halted him an instant. Then, deftly shifting\nthe sentence, he concluded, \"--in a number of places.\"\n\n\"So.\" Another pause. \"Then I should explain about tribes. Tribes here\ngenerally consist of from fifty to five hundred or more persons living\nin big houses called '_malocas_.' Unless the tribe is very big, one\nhouse holds them all. There may be any number of _malocas_, the\ninhabitants of which are all of the same racial stock; yet each _maloca_\nis, as far as government is concerned, a tribe to itself, controlled by\na chief. No _maloca_ owes any duty to any other _maloca_. There is no\nsupreme ruler over all, nor even a federation among them. They live\nmerely as neighbors--distant neighbors. At times they fight like\nneighbors. You understand.\"\n\n\"'When Greek meets Greek--'\" quoted McKay.\n\n\"Just so. When I say, then, that the Red Bones are a big tribe, I mean\nthat there are about five hundred--maybe more--individuals in their main\nsettlement. They live in huts, not in one big tribe-house like the\nMayorunas. They are not Mayorunas, in fact; they paint differently, are\ndarker of skin, and more cruel.\n\n\"The Mayorunas, by the way, are not so debased as you might think.\nThough cannibals, they do not kill for the sake of eating 'long pig,'\nlike the cannibals of the South Seas. Neither do they eat the whole\nbody. Only the hands and feet of their dead enemies are devoured. These\nare carefully cooked and eaten as delicacies along with monkey meat,\nbirds, fish, and other things prepared for a feast in honor of a\nvictory. The eating of human flesh seems to be symbolism rather than\nsavagery. Furthermore, they do not range the jungle hunting for victims.\nThey eat only those who come against them as enemies.\n\n\"So it is quite possible, you see, that strangers might go among them\nand escape death. It would depend largely on the ability of the\nstrangers to convince the savages that they were friends. The difficulty\nis that the savages consider all strangers to be enemies until\nfriendship is proved.\"\n\n\"A sizable difficulty,\" McKay remarked.\n\n\"Almost insurmountable. Yet it might be done. Mind, I speak now of the\nMayorunas, not of the Red Bones. I tell you again that the Red Bone\ncountry is closed.\"\n\n\"And where is the Mayoruna region?\"\n\n\"In the same general section. The Mayorunas are much more widely\ndistributed. They are on both banks of the Javary and extend as far west\nas the Ucayali.\n\n\"Now if I sought to enter the Red Bone region--and again I say I would\nnot--this would be my way of going at it. I would go first among the\nMayorunas near the Red Bones and seek to convince them that I was their\nfriend. I would make the Mayoruna chief as friendly to me as possible. I\nmight even take a Mayoruna woman for a time--some of them are handsome,\nand such a step would make me almost a Mayoruna myself in their eyes.\nThen I would persuade the chief to send messengers to the Red Bones with\nword of me and a request that I be allowed to visit their settlement.\nThe request, coming from the Mayoruna chief, probably would be granted.\nI would then go in with a bodyguard of Mayorunas, do my business, and\ncome out via the Mayoruna route.\"\n\nA thoughtful silence ensued. Bottle necks clinked against the cups.\n\n\"Something in that idea,\" conceded Knowlton. \"A good deal in it. Barring\nthe woman part, of course.\"\n\n\"Ay,\" spoke McKay, his tone casual as ever. \"When you came out what\nwould you do with your woman, _mein Herr_?\"\n\nSchwandorf, tongue loosened a bit by his k\u00fcmmel, chuckled.\n\n\"Ho-ho! The woman? Leave her, of course, when she had served my purpose.\nWhy bother about a woman here and there?\"\n\n\"I see.\" McKay's face, indistinct in the gloom, was unreadable, but his\ntone had a caustic edge.\n\nSchwandorf laughed again. \"You are fresh from the woman-worshiping\nUnited States and you disapprove. But this is the jungle, and all is\ndifferent. '_Cada terra com seu uso_,' as these Brazilians say--each\nland with its own ways. Perhaps when you have met the Mayoruna women,\nlooked on their handsome faces and shapely forms--they wear no clothing,\nby the way--you will change your ideas. More than one man along this\nborder has risked his life to win one of those women. But that rests\nwith you. And now if you will excuse me, gentlemen, I have an engagement\nwith a man at the other end of town.\"\n\n\"Certainly. We are indebted to you for your interest.\"\n\n\"It is nothing. Remember that I strongly advise you not to go. But if\nyou will go, I shall gladly do whatever lies in my power to aid you in\npreparing for the trip. Do not hesitate to call on me.\"\n\nHe passed into the house, returning almost at once.\n\n\"By the way,\" he added, \"one of you has the room next mine?\"\n\n\"I have it,\" said Knowlton.\n\n\"Yes. Are you a good sleeper? I sometimes snore most atrociously, I am\ntold. So perhaps--\"\n\n\"Don't worry. I can sleep in the middle of a bombardment.\"\n\n\"You are fortunate. Good evening, gentlemen.\"\n\nWhen he was gone they sat for a time smoking, sipping now and then at\ntheir highballs. At length McKay said, \"Humph!\"\n\n\"Amen. Pretty square sort of chap, though, don't you think?\"\n\n\"I'm not saying,\" was the Scot's cautious answer. \"Seems to be trying to\ndiscourage us and egg us on at the same time. Something up his sleeve,\nperhaps.\"\n\n\"Can't tell. But his line of talk rings true so far. Checks up all right\nwith what we've heard about the Mayorunas and so on. And that scheme of\nworking in through the Mayoruna country sounds about as sensible as\nanything. Desperate chance and all that, but it might work. Say, why did\nyou kick me when I was going to tell him you'd been in British Guiana?\"\n\n\"Don't know exactly. Had a hunch. Seems to me I've seen that fellow\nbefore somewhere, but I can't place him. None of his business where I've\nbeen, anyhow. We're boobs from the States hunting for a wild man. That's\nall he needs to know.\"\n\nBut it was not enough for Schwandorf to know. At that very moment he was\non his way to the home of Superintendent Cabral, with whom he had no\nengagement whatever, to learn all he could concerning the business of\nthese military-appearing strangers; also to impress on that official the\nfact that he had sought to dissuade them from starting on their mad\nquest.\n\nAnd much later that night, when Knowlton was making good his boast that\nhe was a sound sleeper, a black-bearded face rose silently above the\niron partition between his room and that of the German. A hand gripping\na small electric flashlight followed. A white ray searched the room,\nhalting on the khaki shirt lying over a box. A tough withe with a barb\nat one end came over like a slender tentacle, hooked the shirt neatly,\ndrew it stealthily up to the top. Shirt, stick, lamp, hand, face all\ndissolved into darkness.\n\nAfter a time they reappeared. The shirt came down, swung slowly back and\nforth, was dropped deftly where it had previously lain. The breast\npocket holding the grain-leather notebook and the photograph of David\nDawson Rand was buttoned as it had been, and the notebook bulged the\ncloth slightly as before. But the contents of that book and the pictured\nface of Rand now were stamped on the brain of Schwandorf. A sneering,\nsnarling smile curled the heavy mouth of Schwandorf. And softly, so\nsoftly that none could hear it but himself, sounded the ironical\nbenediction of Schwandorf:\n\n\"Sleep well, _offizier americanisch_! Dream on, poor fool! In time you\nwill wake up. _Ja_, you will wake up!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nINTO THE BUSH\n\n\nSleepy eyed and frowzy haired, with shirt unbuttoned and breeches and\nboots unlaced, Tim emerged from his iron-walled cell into the\ncool-shadowed main room, blinked at McKay and Knowlton lounging over\ntheir morning coffee and cigarettes, stretched his hairy arms, and\nadvanced sluggishly to the table.\n\n\"Yow-oo-hum!\" he yawned. \"Ain't they cute! All dressed and shaved like\nthey was goin' to visit the C. O. And here's pore Timmy Ryan lookin'\nlike a 'drunk and dirty' jest throwed into the guardhouse, and feelin'\nworse. Top o' the mornin' to ye, gents!\"\n\n\"Same to you, Tim,\" McKay nodded.\n\n\"Who hit you?\" asked Knowlton, squinting at bumps and scratches on Tim's\nforehead.\n\n\"Nobody. Couple fellers tried to, but they was out o' luck. Oh, I see\nwhat ye mean! I done that meself while I was gittin' to bed.\"\n\n\"Waves must have been running high on the ocean last night. Better drink\nsome coffee. Thomaz, another cup--big and black.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Looey. 'Twas kind of an active night, at that.\"\n\n\"I heard you come in,\" vouchsafed McKay. \"Were you trying some high\ndiving in your room?\"\n\n\"Faith, I done some divin' without tryin', but 'twas ragged work--I\npulled a belly smacker every time. I got to tame that hammick o' mine.\nIt throwed me four times hand-running and the only way I could hold it\ndown was to unhook it and lay it on the floor.\"\n\n\"Sleep well then?\"\n\n\"I did not. Cap, I thought I knowed somethin' about cooties, but I take\nit back--I never knowed nothin' about them insecks till last night.\nWhere they come from I dunno, but I'll tell the world they come, and if\nthey wasn't half an inch long I'll eat 'em. They darn near dragged me\noff whole, and all the sleep I got ye could stick in a flea's eye.\nLookit here.\"\n\nHe extended an arm dotted with swollen red spots.\n\n\"Ants!\" said McKay, after one glance. \"Ants, not cooties. They're\neverywhere. Especially under the floor. That's one reason why folks\nsleep in hammocks down here. Even then they're likely to come down the\nhammock cords and drive you out.\"\n\n\"Ants, hey? Never thought o' that. And I'd sooner spend another night\nfightin' all the man-eatin' jaggers in the jungle than them bugs. It's\nthe little things that count, as the feller said when his wife give him\nhis fourteenth baby.\"\n\nHe downed the thick coffee brought by Thomaz, demanded another cup,\naccepted cigarette and light from Knowlton, and sighed heavily.\n\n\"Who tried to hit you?\" Knowlton persisted.\n\n\"Aw, I dunno. Two-three fellers took swipes at me with bottles and\nthings. Me and Joey went to a place where they's card games and so\non--only place in town where the village sports can git action. Joey\noffers to buy, and does. Stuff tastes kind o' moldy to me, so I asks\nhave they got any American beer. They have. It's bottled and warm, but\nit's beer and tastes like home. It goes down so slick I buy another\nround, and then one more, lettin' in a thirsty-lookin' stranger on the\nthird round. That makes seven bottles altogether. Then I think mebbe I\nbetter pay up now before I lose track. Looey, guess what them seven\nbottles o' suds come to in American money.\"\n\n\"M-m-m! Well, say about three and a half or four dollars.\"\n\n\"That's what I figgered,\" mourned Tim. \"But them highbinders want\nthirty-two dollars and twenty cents, American gold.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"Sad but true. Seems the stuff sells here for four bucks and sixty cents\na bottle. Thinkin' I'm gittin' rooked because I'm a tenderfoot, I raise\na row to oncet and start to climb the guy. Other folks mix in and things\ngit lively right off. But after I've dropped a couple o' fellers Joey\nwinds himself round me and begs me not to make him arrest me, and also\ntells me I'm all wrong--that's the regular price. So o'course that makes\nme out a cheap skate unless I come acrost, and I do the right thing.\"\n\n\"Lucky you had the money on you,\" said McKay, eying him a bit oddly.\n\n\"I didn't,\" chuckled Tim. \"All the dough I had was one pore lonesome\nten-spot--the one I got from ye yesterday, Cap. But I don't tell 'em\nthat. I jest wave my hand like thirty-two plunks wasn't nothin' in my\nyoung life, and start to work meself out o' the hole. After the two guys\non the floor are brought back to their senses I order up drinks for all\nhands and git popular again. Then I git out the bones.\"\n\n\"Oh! I see!\" McKay laughed silently.\n\n\"Sure. Remember they told us on the boat that these guys will gamble on\nanything? And that a feller without shoes on may be some rubber worker\npackin' a roll that would choke a horse? Wal, I make a few passes with\nthem dice o' mine and their eyes light up like somebody had switched on\nthe current. Then I scrabble me hand around in me pants pocket, like I\nwas peelin' a bill off a roll so big I didn't want to flash the whole\nwad, and haul out that pore li'l' ten and ask would anybody like to play\na man's game.\n\n\"They would. I'll say they would. And they got the coin to back up their\nplay, too. Before I come home I was buyin' beer by the case instead o'\nthe bottle. And it's all paid for, and I got more 'n a hundred dollars\nleft, besides givin' Joey a fistful o' money jest for bein' a good\nfeller. This ain't a bad town at all, gents. Outside o' that\nbuckin'-broncho hammick and the man-eatin' ants I had a lovely evenin'.\"\n\n\"How about Joao's lady friend?\" quizzed Knowlton.\n\n\"Huh? Oh, I didn't git to see her. When bones and beer are rollin' high\nand handsome I got no time for women. Besides, I found out she was\nmostly Injun and fat as a hog. Nothin' like that for li'l' Timmy Ryan.\nOh, say, before I forgit it--I asked Joey about this Dutchman here, and\nhe says--\"\n\nMcKay scowled, shook his head, pointed toward the closed door of\nSchwandorf. Tim lifted his brows, winked understanding, and went on with\na break: \"--that this guy Sworn-off is a reg'lar feller and knows this\nriver like a book. Says he's one fine guy and a man from hair to heels.\"\n\nFollowing which he grimaced as if something smelled bad, adding in a\nbarely audible whisper, \"And that's the worst lie I ever told.\"\n\n\"We met Mr. Schwandorf last night after you went,\" Knowlton said,\neasily, drawing down one eyelid. \"Very likable sort of chap. He's going\nto help us get started upriver.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. When do we go? To-day?\"\n\n\"If possible.\"\n\n\"Glad of it. This big-town sportin' life would be the ruination of a\nsimple country kid like me. Yo-hum! Wonder how all our neighbors are\nthis mornin'--the goat and the drunk and the two sick fellers. Kind o'\nquiet over that side o' the room.\"\n\nThomaz entered just then with more coffee. Knowlton turned to him.\n\n\"Are the sick men better to-day, Thomaz?\"\n\n\"Much better, senhor,\" the lad said, carelessly. \"They are dead.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Tim grunted, explosively.\n\n\"Dead,\" the youth repeated. \"They were taken out at dawn. Do not be\nalarmed. It was the swamp fever, which is not--what you say?--catching.\"\n\n\"Humph! Sort of a reg'lar thing to die of fever here, hey?\"\n\nThomaz shrugged as if hearing a foolish question.\n\n\"_Si._ Swamp fever, yellow fever, smallpox, beriberi--to-day we live,\nto-morrow we are dead.\"\n\n\"True for ye. They's allays somethin' hidin' round the corner waitin' to\njump ye, no matter where ye are. If 'tain't one thing, it's another.\"\n\nDespite his philosophical answer, however, Tim fell silent, his eyes\ngoing to the doors of the rooms where Death had stalked last night while\nhe was gambling. Like most men in whose veins red blood runs bold and\nfree, he had no fear of the sort of death befitting a fighter--sudden\nand violent--but a deep repugnance for those two assassins against which\na victim could not fight back--disease and poison. The Brazilian youth's\nnonchalant fatalism aroused him to the fact that here both those forms\nof death were very near him; the one in the air, the other on the\nground--fever and snakes.\n\nFor the moment he was depressed. Then curiosity awoke.\n\n\"If this here, now, Javary fever ain't catchin', how does a feller git\nit?\"\n\n\"Mosquitoes,\" McKay enlightened him. \"The _anopheles_. It bites a man\nwho has fever, then bites a well man and leaves the fever in him. Inside\nof ten days he's sick, unless he takes a huge dose of quinine right\naway. Mosquito attacks perpendicular to the skin. That is, it stands on\nits head. If you ever notice one of them biting that way get busy with\nthe quinine.\"\n\n\"Huh! Fat chance a feller's got o' seein' just how all these bugs bite\nhim. And one muskeeter standin' on its head does all that, hey?\"\n\n\"So they say. Also they say it's only the female that bites.\"\n\n\"Yeah. I believe it. I been stung more 'n once by females before now.\nHow about the yeller fever? Git that the same way?\"\n\n\"Same way, only a different mosquito--the _stegomyia_. When you begin to\nvomit black you're gone. And if you get beriberi you're gone, too. First\nsymptoms of that are numbness of the fingers and toes. Muscular\nparalysis goes on until your heart stops.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. Nice cheerful place to die in, this Ammyzon jungle. Aw well,\nwhat's the odds?\"\n\nWherewith he inhaled more coffee, flipped his cigarette butt at a small\nlizard on the floor not far away, yawned once more, and swaggered out to\nthe piazza, bawling:\n\n    \"And when I die\n      Don't bury me a-tall,\n    But pickle me bones\n      In alky-hawl--\"\n\nWhen his roar had subsided and the two former officers had sat silent a\nmoment, smiling over his nocturnal adventures, the door of Schwandorf's\nroom opened abruptly and the German stepped out.\n\n\"_Morgen_,\" he grunted, striding to the table. \"Thomaz!\"\n\n\"_Si_, Senhor Sssondoff.\" The youth faded away into the kitchen\nquarters.\n\n\"Always feel grumpy until I eat,\" grumbled the blackbeard. \"None of this\ncoffee-cigarette breakfast for me. A real meal, coffee with gin in it, a\ncigar--then I feel human. Sleep well?\"\n\nHis bold gaze never flickered as it encountered Knowlton's.\n\n\"Fine. If you snored I didn't know it. Didn't hear the bodies taken out\nthis morning, either.\"\n\n\"Bodies! Oh! Those fellows dead?\" He tilted his head toward the doors\nbehind which the sick men had lain. \"Glad of it. Best for them and\neverybody else. Hate to have sick people in the place.\"\n\nThe Americans said nothing. They lit new cigarettes and waited for the\nother to become \"human.\" And when his substantial breakfast was down,\nhis gin-flavored coffee had disappeared, and his big cigar was aglow, he\ndid.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen, have you decided to take good advice and let your\nRaposa alone?\" he asked, affably.\n\n\"Who ever follows good advice?\" Knowlton countered. Schwandorf chuckled.\n\n\"_Niemand._ Nobody. So you will go.\" He shook his head solemnly. \"I have\nsaid all I can without offense. But if you persist I can only help you\nto start. If possible I should like to go with you up the river to the\nplace where you will take to the bush; but I must go to Iquitos, in\nPeru, on the monthly launch which is due in a day or two, so all my\nbusiness is in the other direction. If now I can aid in the matter of a\ncrew--\"\n\n\"That is what we were about to ask of you.\"\n\n\"So. Then let us be about it. I have been thinking, since you showed\nyour determination last night, and have made inquiries about men. There\nare now in Nazareth, the little Peruvian town across the river, several\nmen from whom you can pick an excellent crew. Men of the river and the\nbush, not worthless loafers like these townsmen here. Men who are not\nafraid of hell or high water, as the saying is. Not remarkable for\neither beauty or brains, but good men for your work--by far the best you\ncan obtain. I would suggest a large canoe and six or eight of those men\nas crew.\"\n\nThe others smoked thoughtfully. Then McKay said, \"We should prefer\nBrazilians.\"\n\n\"Not if you knew the people hereabouts as well as I. It, of course,\nmakes no personal difference to me what sort of crew you get, but I tell\nyou that these men are best. What does it matter which side of the river\nthey come from? Men are men.\"\n\n\"True,\" McKay conceded.\n\n\"Can't be too fussy here,\" Knowlton added. \"Let's see the men.\"\n\nAll rose. But then Schwandorf suggested:\n\n\"No need of your going to Nazareth. Better stay here, unless you want to\ngo through a great deal of ceremonious foolishness over there. It's\nPeruvian ground and the barefooted ignoramuses of officials may insist\non showing their importance by demanding your papers and all that. I can\ngo across, get the men, and be back here before you'd be half through\nthe preliminaries. Saves time.\"\n\n\"All right, if it's not too much trouble.\"\n\n\"A good deal less trouble than if you went, to be frank. I'm known, and\nI can go straight about the business. So sit down and wait. Thomaz! My\nhat!\"\n\nOut he tramped to the piazza, where he paused a moment to run a swift\neye over the disheveled figure of Tim, who had fallen sound asleep in a\nchair. Then, without a further word or glance, he descended the ladder\nand swung away down the street. The Americans, watching him from the\ndoorway, observed that children in his path hastened to get out of it,\nand that he spoke to nobody.\n\n\"Prussian,\" rasped McKay.\n\n\"M-hm! Done time in the Kaiser's army, too, even if he has been here\nsince before the war. But he's treating us pretty white.\"\n\nThe captain made no answer. Their eyes followed the big figure until\nthey saw it go sliding away toward Peru in a canoe propelled by two\nlanguid townsmen. Then McKay dropped a hand on Tim's shoulder. The\nred-lashed eyes flew open instantly.\n\nBriefly, quietly, Knowlton told of what had passed while he napped, then\nasked what information he had gleaned from Joao.\n\n\"He says,\" answered Tim, \"this guy is a queer duck. Been around here\nquite a while, but Joey don't know what's his game. He goes off on trips\nupriver, stays quite a while, comes back unexpected, and nobody knows\nwhere he's been or why. He don't use Brazilian boatmen--gits his men on\nthe other side. And the Peru boys themselves dunno where he goes, or,\nanyways, they say they don't.\n\n\"Two of 'em come over here awhile back and got drunk, and Joey tried to\npump 'em, but all the dope he got was that this here Fritz goes away\nupstream to a li'l' camp, and from there he goes off into the bush\nalone, and the Peru guys jest hang around the camp till he gits back.\nSounds kind o' fishy to me, and Joey says it does to him, too, but he\ncouldn't work nothin' more out o' the drunks because about that time\nSworn-off himself comes buttin' in and asks these guys what they think\nthey're doin' on this side the river, and they beat it back to Peru toot\nsweet. He's got their goat, all right, and I wouldn't wonder if he's got\nJoey's, too. Anyways, Joey tells me he's off this geezer and advises me\nto lay off him, too, though he can't name a thing against him.\"\n\n\"Queer,\" said Knowlton, looking again at the canoe out on the water.\n\n\"Gun running?\" suggested McKay.\n\n\"Nope,\" Tim contradicted. \"I thought o' that, but Joey says they's\nnothin' to it; they watched this sourkrout close, and he don't never git\nno guns from nowheres. Besides, they's nobody up there to run guns to\nbut Injuns, and them Injuns are so wild they don't want no guns; they\nstick to the bow and arrer and such stuff, which they sure know how to\nuse. Whatever his game is, he plays a lone hand as far's this town\nknows. Got no pals here, and nobody wants to walk on his corns.\"\n\n\"May be perfectly all right, too,\" mused Knowlton. \"A little gold cache\nor something--though he said there was none in this region. Oh, well,\nwhat do we care? We have our hands full with our own business, and all\nassistance is appreciated.\"\n\nAn hour drifted past. Men of the town lounged by, looking curiously at\nthe strangers, some nodding and voicing a friendly, \"_Boa dia._\" Women,\ntoo, watched them from windows and doors, and children slyly peeped\naround corners until something more important--such as a cat, a goat, or\na gorgeous butterfly--came their way. Tim went inside and slicked up a\nbit by buttoning and lacing his clothes and combing his rebellious hair.\nAt length a long boat put out from the farther shore and came surging\nacross the sun-gleaming river.\n\n\"Handle themselves well,\" McKay approved, noting the easy grace of the\ncrew. In the bow a tall, slender fellow stood with arms folded,\nbalancing himself to the sway of the rather clumsy craft and watching\nthe water ahead. In the stern, on a little platform whence he could look\nover the heads of the others and catch any signal from the lookout, a\nsquat, dark-faced steersman lounged against his crude rudder. Between\nthese two the paddlers stood, each with one foot on the bottom of the\nlong dugout and the other on the gunwale, swinging in nonchalant unison\nas their blades moved fore and aft. Under the curving roof of a\nrough-and-ready cabin, open at the sides to allow free play of air,\nSchwandorf lolled like some old-time barbarian king.\n\nDown to the landing place trudged the three Americans, and there the\nemployers and the prospective employees looked one another over with\ninterest. Eight men had come with Schwandorf, and a hard gang they were.\nThe bowman, hawk nosed, slant eyed, black mustached, with hairy chest\nshowing under his unbuttoned cotton shirt, had the face and bearing of a\nbuccaneer chieftain; and the effect was intensified by a flaring red\nhandkerchief around his head and the haft of a knife protruding from his\nwaistband. The rowers behind him, though of varying degrees of\nswarthiness and height, all had the same sinewy build, the same bold\nstare, the same devil-may-care insolence of manner; and though none but\nthe lookout wore the piratical red around his brow, more than one knife\nhilt showed at their waists. The steersman, whose copper-brown skin and\nflat face betokened a heavy strain of Indian blood, gazed stolidly at\nthe Americans with the unwinking, expressionless eyes of a snake. Back\ninto the minds of McKay and Knowlton came Schwandorf's words, \"Men not\nafraid of hell or high water.\" They looked it.\n\n\"Here they are,\" announced the German, stepping ashore deliberately.\n\"Jos\u00e9, the _puntero_\"--his hand indicated the lookout--\"Francisco, the\n_popero_\"--pointing to the steersman--\"and six _bogas_. Good men.\"\n\nMcKay ran a cold eye along the line of faces, his gaze plumbing each.\nUnder that chill scrutiny the third man's stare wavered and dropped.\nThat of the next also veered aside. The rest fronted him eye to eye.\n\n\"Two of them will not do,\" he asserted, in the brusque tone of a captain\ninspecting his company. \"Numbers Three and Four--fall out!\"\n\nLiteral obedience would have put Three and Four into the river,\nwherefore they stood fast. But, though they did not quite understand the\nmeaning of the words, they grasped the fact that they were not wanted.\nOne laughed impudently, the other slid a poisonous glance at the\nbleak-faced officer. The squat Francisco scowled. So did Schwandorf.\n\n\"No man who cannot look me in the eye is needed on this trip,\" McKay\ndeclared. \"Also, six men are enough. If necessary we will bear a hand at\nthe paddles ourselves. Jos\u00e9, you have been told by Senhor Schwandorf\nwhat we want?\"\n\n\"_Si._\"\n\n\"You can start at once?\"\n\n\"_Si._\"\n\n\"What pay?\"\n\n\"We leave that to you.\"\n\n\"Um! A dollar a day for each man?\"\n\n\"Money or goods?\"\n\n\"American gold.\"\n\n\"_Si. Bueno._\"\n\n\"Very well. Take those two men back to Nazareth, get what belongings you\nneed, return here, and report to me at the hotel. I am captain.\nUnderstand?\"\n\n\"_Si_--Capitan.\"\n\n\"All right. On your way!\"\n\nAs the boat drew out the two rejected men bade the Americans an ironical\n\"_adios_,\" and one spat in the stream. In the faces of the others,\nhowever, showed something like respect for the crisp-spoken captain, and\nJos\u00e9 snarled something at the ill-mannered Three and Four.\n\n\"You might need those men,\" mumbled Schwandorf.\n\n\"Guess not,\" McKay answered, serenely, turning toward the hotel. \"Come\non, boys. Let's get our stuff ready to ride.\"\n\nLess than two hours later their rooms were vacant, their duffle was\nstowed in the long dugout, the Peruvian crew stood arrogantly eying the\nBrazilians who had gathered to witness the departure, and the Americans\nwere bidding good-by to Remate de Males in general and its German\nresident in particular.\n\n\"Mr. Schwandorf, we thank you for your efficient aid,\" said Knowlton,\nextending a hearty hand. \"You have helped us to get going with all\ndispatch, and we trust that we can repay the favor soon.\"\n\n\"You owe me no thanks,\" was the curt reply. \"I would expect you to do as\nmuch for me if our positions were reversed. I wish you luck.\"\n\n\"Get aboard, Tim!\" McKay ordered, setting the example himself. Tim\nobeyed, first giving the important Joao d'Almeida Magalhaes Nabuco\nPestana da Fonseca a real American handgrip and getting in return a\ndouble embrace from that worthy official. Whereafter he winked and\ngrinned expansively at several women garbed in violent hues of red,\nyellow, and green, frowned slightly at Schwandorf, lit the last cigar he\nwas to smoke for many a long day, and, as the dugout began to move,\nerupted into a more or less musical farewell to the females of the\nspecies:\n\n    \"The Yanks are goin' away,\n        Pa-a-arley-voo!\n    They're movin' on to-day,\n        Pa-a-arley-voo!\n    The Yanks are goin' away, they say,\n    Leavin' the girls in a heartless way,\n        Rinkydinky-parley-voo!\"\n\nWith one final wave of his cigar to the gesticulating Joao and the\ngrinning women he turned his back on the town and faced the little-known\nriver and the inscrutable jungle. But neither his eyes nor his thoughts\ntraveled beyond the bow of the boat. Through narrowed lids he studied\nthe swaying paddlers and the piratical Jos\u00e9. And in his mind echoed the\nwhispered warning of Joao, delivered during the effusive embrace at\nparting:\n\n\"Comrade, watch those _bastardos Peruanos_.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nIN THE NIGHT WATCH\n\n\nDay by day the long canoe crawled into the vast unknown. Day by day the\ndown-flowing jungle river pushed steadily, sullenly against its prow, as\nif striving to repel the invasion of its secret places by the\nfair-skinned men of another continent. Day by day it slid past in\nresentful impotence, conquered by the swinging blades of the Peruvian\n_bogas_. And day by day the close companionship of canoe and camp seemed\nto weld the voyagers into one compact unit.\n\nThrough hours of blazing sun, when the mercury of the thermometer which\nKnowlton had hung inside the shady _toldo_ cabin fluctuated well above\n100 degrees, the hardy crew forged on. Through drenching rains they\nstill hung doggedly to their work, suspending it only when the water\nfell in such drowning quantities that they were forced to tie up hastily\nto shore and seek cover in order to breathe. When sunset neared they\npicked with unerring eye a spot fit for camping, attacked the bush with\nwhirling machetes, cleared a space, threw up pole frameworks, swiftly\nthatched them with great palm leaves, and thus created from the jungle\ntwo crude but efficient huts--one for themselves and one for their\n_patrones_. When night had shut down and all hands squatted around the\nfire in a nightly smoke talk they regaled their employers with wild\ntales of adventures in bush and town, some of which were not at all\npolite, but all of which were mightily interesting. And despite all\ndiscomforts, fatigue, and the minor incidents and accidents which often\nlead fellow travelers in the wilderness to bickering and bitterness, no\nfriction developed between the men of the north and the men of the\nsouth.\n\nNot that the Peruvians were at all obsequious or servile. They were a\nreckless, lawless, Godless gang, perpetually bearing themselves with the\ncareless insolence which had characterized them at first, blasphemous of\nspeech toward one another--but never toward the North Americans.\nDisputes arose among them with volcanic suddenness, and more than once\nknives were half drawn, only to be slipped back under the tongue-lashing\nof the hawk-nosed _puntero_, Jos\u00e9, who damned the disputants completely\nand promised to cut out the bowels of any man daring to lift his\nblade clear of its sheath. Five minutes afterward the fire eaters\nwould be on as good terms as ever, shrugging and grinning at their\npassengers--particularly Tim, who, shaking his head disgustedly, would\ngrumble:\n\n\"Aw, pickles! Another frog fight gone bust!\"\n\nYet Tim, for all his disparagement of these abortive spats, knew full\nwell that any one of them held the makings of a deadly duel and that\nJos\u00e9's lurid threats were no mere Latin hyperbole. He realized that the\nred-crowned bowman ruled his crew exactly as any of the old-time\nbuccaneers whom he resembled had governed their free-booting gangs--by\nthe iron hand; and that, though these men sailed no Spanish Main and\nflew no black flag, the iron-hand government was needed. He saw also\nthat the rough-and-ready courtesy of this crowd toward their passengers\nwas due largely to the attitude of Captain McKay, who had enforced their\nrespect at the start by his soldierly bearing and retained it ever since\nby his military management.\n\nFor the captain, experienced in directing men, conducted himself at all\ntimes as a commanding officer should: he saw all, said little, treated\nJos\u00e9 as a subordinate officer, and left the handling of the crew\nentirely to him. His aloofness forestalled any of that familiarity\nwhich, with such a gang, would have led to contempt. On the other hand,\nhis avoidance of any assumption of meddlesome authority prevented the\nirritation and dislike which free men inevitably feel for the\nself-important type of leader. Thus he cannily steered himself and his\nmates between the two rocks which might have wrecked the expedition\nbefore it was well started. And Knowlton, ex-lieutenant, and Tim,\nex-sergeant, seeing and understanding, followed his example.\n\nSo the days and nights rolled by, the miles of never-ending jungle shore\nfell away behind, and, save for the occasional outbreaks between members\nof the crew, all was serene. To all appearances the Peruvians were\nwhole-heartedly interested in serving their employers faithfully, and\nthe North Americans were gliding onward with no thought of insecurity.\nYet appearances frequently are deceptive.\n\nIn the heat of the day--in fact, before the broiling sun neared the\nzenith--Tim and Knowlton habitually fell asleep inside the _toldo_, not\nto awake until two hours before sunset, when, according to the routine\nagreed upon, the night's camping place would be sought and two or three\nof the Peruvians would go into the bush with rifles, seeking fresh meat.\nMcKay never slept during the day's traverse. Nothing escaped his eye\nfrom the time when he emerged from his mosquito net in the misty morning\nuntil he entered it again by firelight. The men in the boat; the\nfloating alligators and wading birds of the water; the flashing parrots,\njacamars, toucans, trogons, and hummers of the air; the yard-long\nlizards and nervous spider monkeys of the tangled tree branches\nalongshore--all these he watched quietly as the boat forged on. And the\nsinister Francisco, watching him in turn, and the paddlers throwing\noccasional glances his way, came to regard him as the only alert member\nof the trio. Wherein they erred.\n\nThe truth was that every one of the three adventurers was on his guard.\nTim had not forgotten the last words of his boon companion, Joao, and at\nthe first opportunity he had quietly passed on that warning. Moreover,\nMcKay and Knowlton, without discussing the matter, had meditated on the\nunexpected assistance of Schwandorf, the speed with which the crew had\nbeen obtained, the promptness of Jos\u00e9 to accept the first payment\noffered, and other things. Wherefore it had come about that at no hour\nof the twenty-four was every eye and ear closed. And the real reason why\nred Tim and blond Knowlton slept by day was that they thus made up the\nslumber lost at night.\n\nNot that either of them patrolled the camp in sentry go. So far as the\nPeruvians knew, they slept as soundly as McKay. But, lying in their\nhammocks, they divided the night watches between them on a schedule as\nregular as that of a military camp, though the shifts necessarily were\nlonger. As sunset came always at six o'clock and all hands sought their\nhanging beds two hours later, Tim's \"tour of duty\" lasted until one in\nthe morning. When the phosphorescent hands of his watch pointed to that\nhour he stealthily reached out and jabbed Knowlton, sleeping beside him.\nWhen a barely audible \"All right\" reached his ears he was officially\nrelieved.\n\nNight followed night, became a week, lengthened into a fortnight. Still,\nso far as the crew was concerned, nothing happened. A little rough\nbanter among them as they smoked their last cigarettes, then sleep and\nsnores; and that was all until morning. Men less experienced in night\nvigils than the ex-soldiers would have abandoned their watches long\nbefore this--if, indeed, they had ever adopted them. But these three\nwere schooled in patience. Moreover, neither Tim nor Knowlton had ever\nbefore penetrated the jungle, and at times the light of the waxing moon\nrevealed to their eyes strange things which they never would have seen\nby day. So the tedium of the long hours of wakefulness might be broken\nat any moment.\n\nOnce they camped close to a conical hillock of compact earth, some four\nfeet high and almost stone hard, from which radiated narrow covered\ngalleries--the citadel and viaducts of a community of termites. Tim,\nstill harboring vivid recollections of his ant battle at Remate de\nMales--though by this time he had trained himself to sleep in his\nhammock, where he was comparatively safe--looked askance at it when told\nwhat it was, and was only partly reassured by the information that\ntermites were eaters of wood rather than of flesh. After sleep had\nembraced the rest of the camp he still was uneasy, lifting his net at\nlong intervals and squinting at the moonlit mound as if expecting a\nhorde of pincer-jawed insects to erupt from it and charge him. And\nduring one of these inspections he saw something totally unexpected.\n\nFrom the black shadows of the forest had emerged another shadow, so\ngrotesque and misshapen that it seemed a figment of indigestion and\nweird dreams--a thing from whose shaggy body protruded what appeared to\nbe only a long tubular snout where a head should be, and which looked to\nbe overbalanced at the other end by a great mass of hair. It stood stone\nstill, and for the moment Tim could not decide which end of it was head\nand which was tail, or even whether it were not double-tailed and\nheadless. Then, slowly, the apparition moved.\n\nInto that hard-packed earth it dug huge hooked claws, and from its\ntapering muzzle a wormlike tongue licked about, gathering the outrushing\nwhite ants into its gullet. For minutes Tim lay blinking at it,\nwondering if he really saw it.\n\nThen, picking up his rifle, he slipped outside his net and advanced on\nthe creature.\n\nThe animal turned, sat back on its great tail, lifted its terrible\nclaws, and waited. Six feet away, just out of its reach, Tim stopped and\nstared anew. Then he grinned.\n\n\"You win, feller,\" he informed the beast. \"What ye are I dunno, but any\ncritter that's got the guts to ramble right into camp and offer to gimme\na battle is too good a sport for me to shoot. Help yourself to all the\nants in the world, for all o' me. I'm goin' back to bed. Bon sewer,\nmonseer.\"\n\nWherewith, still grinning, but warily watching, he backed until sure the\nbig invader would not spring at him. Knowing nothing of ant bears, he\ndid not know it was hardly a springing animal.\n\nIts claws looked sufficiently formidable to disembowel a man--as,\nindeed, they were, if the man came near enough. But when Tim had\nwithdrawn and the sluggish brute had decided that it would not need to\ndefend itself, it sank to all-fours and passed stiffly away into the\nshades whence it had come.\n\nOn another night, when Tim slept, Knowlton detected a creeping,\nslithering sound which made him slip off the safety catch of his\nheavy-bulleted pistol and peer at the hut where slept the crew. No man\nwas moving there. Still the sound persisted. Lifting his net, he spied\nbeyond the hut of the Peruvians a moving mass on the ground--a\ncylindrical bulk which looked to be two feet thick, and which glided\npast like a solid stream of dark water flowing along above the dirt. Its\nbeginning and end were hidden in the bush, and not until it tapered into\nnothing and was gone did he realize fully that he had been gazing at an\nenormous anaconda. Then he kicked himself for not shooting it. But\nbefore long he congratulated himself for letting it go.\n\nPerhaps an hour later the startled forest resounded with an agonized\nscream, so piercing and so appallingly human that all the camp sprang\nawake. The outcry came but once, sounding from some place not far off,\nnear the water's edge, and in the direction toward which the huge\nserpent had disappeared. Before the watcher had time to tell the others\nof what he had seen, one of the boatmen discovered the rut left in the\nsoft ground by the reptile. Thereafter Knowlton kept his own counsel,\nlistening to the excited curses of the men and observing their pallor\nand their nervous scanning of the shadows. Jos\u00e9 said the screech\nundoubtedly was the death shriek of some animal caught and crushed in\nthe snake's tremendous coil. McKay concurred with a nod. And when\nKnowlton casually said it was tough that nobody had been awake to shoot\nthe thing as it passed the camp, Jos\u00e9 emphatically disagreed.\n\nA bullet fired into that fiendish giant, he averred, would have meant\ndeath to one or more men; for the serpent's writhing coils and lashing\ntail would have knocked down the sleeping-hut and shattered the spines\nof any men they struck. No, let Se\u00f1or Knowlton thank the saints that the\nawful master of the swamps had gone its way unmolested. For the rest of\nthat night Knowlton kept his watch openly, accompanied by Jos\u00e9 and three\nof the paddlers, who refused to sleep again until they should be miles\naway from the vicinity of that dread monster.\n\nTwo nights afterward the camp was aroused again. Tim alone saw the start\nof the disturbance, and he kept mum about it because he did not choose\nto let the Peruvians know he had been on the alert. Out from the gloom\nand straight past the huts a thick-bodied, curve-snouted animal came\ncharging madly for the river, carrying on its back a ferocious cat\ncreature whose fangs were buried deep in its steed's neck--a tapir\nattacked by a jaguar. With a resounding plunge the elephantine quarry\nstruck the water and was gone. The tiger cat, forced to relinquish its\nhold or drown, swam hurriedly back to the bank below the encampment,\nwhere it roared and spat and squalled in a blood-chilling paroxysm of\nbaffled fury. And though every man was awakened, not one left the flimsy\nshelter of his net. Nor did anyone so much as speak until Tim, wearying\nof the noise, announced his intention to \"go bust that critter in the\nnose and give him somethin' to yowl about.\"\n\nThe proposal met with instant and peremptory veto.\n\n\"As you were!\" snapped McKay. \"Let him alone! You wouldn't have a\nChinaman's chance in that black bush. A jaguar is bad all the time, and\nwhen he's mad he's deadly. Never fool with one of those beasts, Tim.\nI've met them before and I know what they can do.\"\n\nTo which Jos\u00e9 agreed with many picturesque oaths, declaring that a\njaguar was no mere beast--it was a devil. Tim, grumbling, obeyed orders.\nThe jaguar, hearing their voices, stopped its noise and probably\nreconnoitered the camp. But no man saw the brute, and its next roar\nsounded from some spot far off in the jungle.\n\nOther things, too, passed within Tim's range of vision from time to time\nin the moonlit hours: a queer bony creature which he took for some new\nkind of turtle, but which really was an armadillo; a monstrous hairy\nspider which slid like a streak up his net, hung there for a time,\ndecided to go elsewhere, and departed with such speed that the man\ninside rubbed his eyes and wondered if he was \"seein' things that\nain't\"; a couple of vampires which flitted in from nowhere like ghoulish\nghosts, wheeled and floated silently on wide wings, seeking an exposed\nfoot protruding from the hammocks, found none, rested a moment on the\nroof poles, chirping hoarsely, and veered out again into the night.\n\nTo Knowlton's watch came a strange owl-faced little monkey with great\nstaring eyes and face ringed with pale fur--one of those night apes\nseldom seen by man; a small troop of kinkajous, slender, long-tailed\nanimals which looked to be monkeys, but were not, and which leaped\ndeftly among the branches like frolicsome little devils let loose to\nplay under the jungle moon; a big scaly iguana, its back ridged with saw\nteeth and its pendulous throat pouch dangling grotesquely under its jaw;\nand more than one deadly snake and huge alligator, the first gliding\npast with venomous head raised and cold eye glinting, the second lying\nquiescent except for occasional openings of horrific jaws.\n\nTo the ears of both the hammock sentinels came the mournful sounds of\nliving things unseen. From the depths beyond drifted the weird plaint of\nthe sloth, crying in the night, \"Oh me, poor sloth, oh-oh-oh-oh!\" Goat\nsuckers repeated by the hour their monotonous refrains, \"Quao quao,\" or\n\"Cho-co-co-cao,\" while a third earnestly exhorted, \"Joao corta pao!\"\n(\"John, cut wood!\"). Tree frogs and crickets clacked and drummed and\nhoo-hooed, guaribas poured their awful discord into the air, and on one\nbright breathless night there sounded over and over a call freighted\nwith wretchedness and despair--the wail of that lonely owl known to the\nbushmen as \"the mother of the moon,\" whose dreadful cry portends evil to\nthose who hear it.\n\nSometimes the air shook with the thunderous concussion of some great\nfalling tree which, long since bled to death by parasitical plant\ngrowths, now at last toppled crashing back into the dank soil whence it\nhad forced its way up into a place in the sun. Other noises, infrequent\nand unexplainable, also drifted at long intervals from the mysterious\nblackness. And in all the medley of night sounds not one was cheerful.\nThe burden of the jungle's cacophonic cantanta ever was the\nsame--despair, disaster, death.\n\nThen came the fifteenth day. It dawned red, the sun fighting an\nensanguined battle with the heavy morning mists and throwing on the\nfaces of the early-rising travelers a sinister crimson hue. Before that\nsun should rise again some of those faces were to be stained a deeper\nred.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nCOLD STEEL\n\n\nSome two hours after the start, while Knowlton and Tim loafed at the\nfore end of the cabin, enjoying the comparative coolness of the early\nday, another boat hove in sight up ahead--a longish craft manned by\neight paddlers and without a cabin.\n\nAs it came into view its bowman tossed his paddle in greeting. The\nPeruvians ignored the salutation. The bowman, after shading his eyes and\npeering at the flamboyant figure of Jos\u00e9, resumed paddling without\nfurther ceremony, evidently intending to pass in silence. But then McKay\narose, waved a hand, and told Jos\u00e9 to steer for the newcomers. Jos\u00e9,\nwith a slightly sour look, gave the signal to Francisco, and the course\nchanged.\n\nThe other canoe slowed and waited. Its men watched the tall figure of\nMcKay. Tim and Knowlton scanned the bronzed faces of those men and liked\nthem at once. The paddlers evidently were Brazilians, but of a different\ntype from the sluggish townsmen of Remate de Males--alert,\nactive-looking fellows, steady of eye, honest of face, muscular of\narm--in all, a more clean-cut set of men than the Peruvians. All three\nof the Americans noticed that no word was exchanged between the two\ncrews.\n\n\"_Boa dia, amigos!_\" spoke McKay. \"Who are you and whence do you come?\"\n\n\"We are rubber workers of Coronel Nunes, senhor,\" the bowman answered,\ncivilly. \"We go to make a new camp. This land is a part of the\n_seringel_ of the coronel, and we left his headquarters yesterday.\"\n\n\"Ah! Then the headquarters is above here?\"\n\n\"One more day's journey,\" the man nodded.\n\n\"I thank you. Good fortune go with you.\"\n\n\"And with you, senhor. May God protect you.\"\n\nWith the words the Brazilian glanced along the line of Peruvian faces\nand his eyes narrowed. Though his words were only a respectful farewell,\nhis expressive face indicated that McKay might be badly in need of\ndivine protection at no distant date. As his paddle dipped and his men\nnodded their leave-taking, Francisco, the _popero_; sneered raucously:\n\n\"Hah! Mere _caucheros_! Workers! Slaves!\"\n\nAnd he spat at the Brazilian boat.\n\nFire shot into the eyes of the bowman and his comrades. Their muscles\ntensed.\n\n\"Better be slaves--better be dogs--than Peruvian cutthroats!\" one\nretorted. \"Go your way, and keep to your own side of the river.\"\n\n\"We go where we will, and no misborn Brazilians can stop us,\" snarled\nFrancisco. To which he added obscene epithets directed against\nBrazilians in general and the men of Coronel Nunes in particular.\n\nThe unprovoked insults angered the Americans as well as the Brazilians.\nKnowlton leaped through the _toldo_ and confronted Francisco.\n\n\"Shut your dirty mouth!\" he blazed.\n\nFor reply, the evil-eyed steersman spat at him the vilest name known to\nman.\n\nAn instant later, his lips split, he sprawled dazedly on his platform,\nperilously close to the edge. Knowlton, the knuckles of his left fist\nbleeding from impact with the other's teeth, stood over him in white\nfury. Francisco's right hand fumbled for his knife. Knowlton promptly\nstamped on that hand with a heavy boot heel.\n\n\"Good eye, Looey!\" rumbled Tim's voice at his back. \"Boot him some more\nfor luck. Hey, you! Back up or I'll drill ye for keeps!\" This to a pair\nof the Peruvian paddlers who had come scrambling through the cabin.\n\nAfter one searching stare into Tim's hard blue eyes and a glance at his\nfist curled around the butt of his belt gun, the _bogas_ backed up. A\nmoment later they were thrown boldly into their own part of the boat by\nJos\u00e9, who blistered them with the profanity of three languages at once.\nThen McKay came through and took charge.\n\n\"That'll do, Tim! Same goes for you, Merry! Jos\u00e9, I'll handle this. You,\nFrancisco! Get up!\"\n\nThe curt commands struck like blows. Every man obeyed. And when the\nsquat steersman again stood up McKay went after him roughshod. In the\ncolloquial Spanish of Mexico and the Argentine, in the man talk of\nAmerican army camps, he flayed that offender alive. Jos\u00e9 himself,\nefficient man handler though he was, stared at his captain in awe. And\nFrancisco, though not given to cringing, skulked like a beaten dog when\nthe verbal flagellation was finished.\n\nTurning then to the Brazilians, McKay formally apologized for the\ninsults to them.\n\n\"It is nothing, senhor,\" coolly answered the bowman--though his glance\nat the Peruvians said plainly that it would have been something but for\nthe swift punishment by the Americans. \"Again I say--may God protect\nyou! Adeos!\"\n\nThe Brazilian boat glided away. The Peruvian craft crawled on upstream\nin silence.\n\nWhen the next camp was made all apparently had forgotten the affair. The\nmen badgered one another as usual, though none mentioned Francisco's\nsplit mouth; and Francisco, himself, albeit sulky, betrayed no sign of\nenmity. After nightfall the regular camp-fire meeting was held and at\nthe usual time all turned in. One more night of listening to the sounds\nof the tropical wilderness seemed all that lay ahead of the secret\nsentinels.\n\nSleep enveloped the huts. Snores and gurgles rose and fell. Tim himself,\nfor the sake of effect, snored heartily at intervals, though his eyes\nnever closed. Through his mosquito bar he could see only vaguely, but he\nknew any man walking from the crew's quarters must cast a very visible\nshadow across that net, and to him the shadow would be as good a warning\nas a clear view of the substance. But the hours crept on and no shadow\ncame.\n\nAt length, however, a small sound reached his alert ear--a sound\ndifferent from the regular noises of the bush--a stealthy, creeping\nnoise like that of a big snake or a huge lizard. It came from the ground\na few feet away, and it seemed to be gradually advancing toward his own\nhammock. Whatever the creature was that made it, its method of progress\nwas not human, but reptilian. Puzzled, suspicious, yet doubtful, Tim\nlifted the rear side of his net, on which no moonlight fell. Head out,\nhe watched for the crawling thing to come close.\n\nIt came, and for an instant he was in doubt as to its character, for\naround it lay the deep shadow of some treetops which at that point\nblocked off the moon. It inched along on its stomach, its black head\nseeming round and minus a face, its body broad but flat--a thing that\nlooked to be a man but not a man. Then, pausing, it raised its head and\npeered toward the hammock of Knowlton. With that movement Tim's doubts\nvanished. The lifting of the head showed the face--the face of\nFrancisco, the face of murder. In its teeth was clamped a bare knife.\n\nForthwith Tim applied General Order Number Thirteen.\n\nIn one bound he was outside his net, colliding with Knowlton, who awoke\ninstantly. In another he was beside the assassin, who, with a lightning\ngrab at the knife in his mouth, had started to spring up. Tim wasted no\ntime in grappling or clinching. He kicked.\n\nHis heavy boot, backed by the power of a hundred and ninety pounds of\nbrawn, thudded into the Indian's chest. Francisco was hurled over\nsidewise on his back. Another kick crashed against his head above the\near. He went limp.\n\n\"Ye lousy snake!\" grated Tim. \"Crawlin' on yer belly to knife a sleepin'\nman, hey? Blast yer rotten heart--\"\n\n\"What's up?\" barked McKay from his hammock.\n\n\"Night attack, Cap. If ye're comin' out bring along yer gat. Hey, Looey,\ngot yer gun on? Some o' these other guys might git gay. They're comin'\nnow.\"\n\nTrue enough, the Peruvian gang was jumping from its hut. With another\nglance at the prostrate Francisco to make sure he was unconscious, Tim\nwhirled to meet them, fist on gun.\n\n\"Halt!\" he roared. \"First guy passin' this corner post gits shot. Back\nup!\"\n\nThe impact of his voice, the menace of his ready gun hand, the sight of\nKnowlton and McKay leaping out with pistols drawn, stopped the rush at\nthe designated post. But swift hands dropped, and when they rose again\nthe moonlight glinted on cold steel.\n\n\"Capitan, what happens here?\" demanded Jos\u00e9, ominously quiet.\n\n\"Knife work,\" McKay replied, curtly. \"Your man Francisco attempted to\ncreep in and murder Se\u00f1or Knowlton. If you and the rest have similar\nintentions, now's your time to try. If not, put away those knives.\"\n\n\"Knives! _Por Dios_, what do you mean?\"\n\n\"Look behind you.\"\n\nJos\u00e9 looked. At once he snarled curses and commands. Slowly the knives\nslipped out of sight. The paddlers edged backward to their own shack,\nleaving their _puntero_ alone.\n\n\"The capitan has it wrong,\" asserted Jos\u00e9. \"We awake to find our\n_popero_ being kicked in the head. We want to know why. If Francisco has\ndone what you say I will deal with him. That I may be sure, allow me to\nlook.\"\n\n\"Very well. Look.\"\n\nJos\u00e9 advanced, stooped, studied the ground, the position of Francisco's\nbody, the knife still clutched in the nerveless hand. Tim growlingly\nvouchsafed a brief explanation of the incident. When Jos\u00e9 straightened\nup, his mouth was a hard line and his eyes hot coals.\n\n\"_Si. Es verdad._ To-morrow we shall have a new _popero_.\"\n\nWith which he stooped again, grasped the prone man by the hair, dragged\nhim into the moonlit space between the huts, and flung him down. \"Juan,\nbring water!\" he ordered.\n\nOne of the paddlers, looking queerly at him, did so. Jos\u00e9 deluged the\nsenseless man. Francisco, reviving, sat up and scowled about him. His\neyes rested on the three Americans standing grimly ready, shoulder to\nshoulder, before their hut; veered to his mates bunched in sinister\nsilence beside their own quarters; shifted again to meet the baleful\nglare of Jos\u00e9. His hand stole to his empty sheath.\n\n\"Your knife, Francisco _mio_?\" queried Jos\u00e9, a menacing purr in his\ntone. \"I have it. It seems that you are in haste to use it. Too much\nhaste, Francisco. But if you will stand instead of crawling as before,\nyou may have your knife again--and use it, too.\"\n\nFrancisco, staring sullenly up, seemed to read in the words more than\nwas evident to the Americans. He lurched to his feet, staggered, caught\nhis balance, braced himself, stood waiting.\n\n\"You know who commands here,\" Jos\u00e9 went on. \"You disobey. You seek to\nstab in the night--\"\n\n\"Now or later--what is the difference?\"\n\n\"--and now the boat is too small for both of us.\" Jos\u00e9 ignored the\ninterruption. \"Here is your knife. Now use it!\"\n\nHe flipped the weapon at the other, who caught it deftly. Jos\u00e9 dropped\nhis right hand to his waist. An instant later naked steel licked out at\nFrancisco's throat.\n\nThe steersman's knife flashed up, caught the reaching blade, knocked it\nwith a scraping clink. For a few seconds the two weapons seemed welded\ntogether, their owners each striving to bear down the other's wrist.\nThen they parted as the combatants sprang back.\n\nJos\u00e9 side-stepped twice to his right. Francisco, turning to preserve his\nguard, now had the light full in his face. But the moon rode so high\nthat the steersman's disadvantage was negligible, and the next assault\nof the _puntero_ was blocked as before. And this time the wrist of the\n_popero_ proved a bit the better; he threw the attacking steel aside and\nstruck in a slashing sweep at his antagonist's stomach.\n\nA convulsive inward movement of the bowman's middle, coupled with a\nswift back-step, made the slash miss by a hair's breadth. With the\nquickness of light Jos\u00e9 was in again. His knife hand, still outstretched\nsidewise, stopped with a light smack of flesh on flesh. Then it jerked\noutward. His steel now was red to the hilt.\n\nOne more rapid step back, a keen glance at his opponent, and Jos\u00e9 stood\nat ease. From Francisco burst a bubbling groan. He staggered. His knife\ndropped. His hands rose fumblingly toward his neck. Suddenly his knees\ngave way and he toppled backward to the ground. The silvery moonlight\ndisclosed a dark flood welling from his severed jugular.\n\nWith the utmost coolness Jos\u00e9 ran two fingers down his wet blade,\nsnapped the fingers in air, and spoke to his crew:\n\n\"As I said, we shall have a new _popero_. To-morrow, Julio, you will\ntake the platform.\"\n\nA rumble ran among the men. Their eyes lifted from Francisco to the\nAmericans, and in them shone a wolfish gleam. The bowman turned sharply\nand faced them.\n\n\"Who growls?\" he rasped. \"You, Julio?\"\n\n\"_Si, yo soy_,\" Julio answered, harshly, fingering his knife. \"I will be\nsteersman, but I steer downstream, not up. Francisco spoke the truth.\nNow or later--what is the difference? Let it be now!\"\n\nA louder growl from the others followed his words. One stepped back into\nthe shadow of the hut.\n\n\"_Perros amarillos!_ Yellow dogs! You go upstream, fools! The Americans\nmust be taken--\"\n\nA raucous sneer from Julio interrupted him. Simultaneously the paddler's\nhand leaped upward, poising a knife.\n\n\"The gringos stay here--and you, too, you Yanqui cur!\"\n\nThe poised knife hissed through the air at Jos\u00e9.\n\nOut from the crew house shot a streak of fire and a smashing rifle\nreport.\n\nJos\u00e9 dodged, staggered, screeched in feline fury, the knife buried in\nhis left arm.\n\nMcKay grunted suddenly, fell, lay still.\n\n\"God!\" yelled Tim. \"Cap's gone! Clean 'em, Looey!\"\n\nWith the words he leaped aside and pulled his pistol, just as another\nrifle flare stabbed out from the other hut and a bullet whisked through\nthe space where he had stood. An instant later he was pouring a stream\nof lead at the spot whence the burning powder had leaped.\n\nKnives flashing, teeth gleaming, the other paddlers charged across the\nten-foot space between the huts.\n\nJos\u00e9, his left arm helpless, but his deadly right hand still gripping\nhis knife, hurled himself on Julio, who had seized a machete from\nsomewhere.\n\nKnowlton slammed a bullet between the eyes of the foremost _boga_, who\npitched headlong. He swung the muzzle to the other man's chest--yanked\nat the trigger--got no response. The gun was jammed.\n\nWith a triumphant snarl the blood-crazed Peruvian closed in, slashing\nfor the throat. Knowlton slipped aside, evaded the thrust, swung the\npistol down hard on his assailant's head. The man reeled, thrust again\nblindly, missed. Knowlton crashed his dumb gun down again. It struck\nfair on the temple. The man collapsed.\n\nTim was charging across the open at the crew house. Jos\u00e9 and Julio were\nlocked in a death grapple. No other living man, except Knowlton, still\nstood upright. Stooping, he peered into the red-dyed face of McKay. Then\nhe laid a hand on the captain's chest. Faint but regular, he felt the\nheart beating.\n\n\"Thank God!\" he breathed. With a wary eye on the battling Peruvians he\nswiftly raised the captain and put him into Tim's hammock. As he turned\nback to the fight Tim emerged from the other hut, carrying a body, which\nhe dropped and swiftly inspected. At the same moment the fight of Jos\u00e9\nand Julio ended.\n\nWith a choked scream Julio dropped, writhed, doubled up. Then he lay\nstill. Jos\u00e9, his face ghastly, stared around him. His mouth stretched in\na terrible smile.\n\n\"So this ends it,\" he croaked, his gaze dropping to Julio. \"_Adios_,\nJulio! The machete is not--so good as the knife--unless one has--room\nto--swing it--\"\n\nHe chuckled hoarsely and sank down.\n\nFor an instant Knowlton hesitated, his glance going back and forth\nbetween McKay and Jos\u00e9. Swiftly then he ran his finger tips over McKay's\nhead. With a murmur of satisfaction he turned from his comrade and\nhurried to the motionless bowman, over whom Tim now bent.\n\n\"Bleedin' to death, Looey,\" informed Tim. \"Ain't cut bad excep' that\narm. That flyin' knife must have got an artery. Can we pull him through?\nHe's a good skate.\"\n\n\"I'll try. You look after Cap. He's only knocked out--bullet creased\nhim--\"\n\n\"Glory be! He's all right, huh? Sure I'll fix him up. Everybody else\ndead? I got that guy in the bunk house--drilled him three times.\"\n\n\"Look out for that fellow over there. Maybe I brained him, but I'm not\nsure.\"\n\nKnowlton was already down on his knees beside Jos\u00e9, working fast to loop\na tourniquet and stop the flow from the pierced arm. With a handkerchief\nand his pistol barrel he shut off the pulsating stream.\n\n\"Yeah, he's done,\" judged Tim, rising from the man whom Knowlton had\ndowned at last. \"Skull's caved in. What 'd ye paste him with?\"\n\n\"Gun. Cursed thing stuck.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. Them automats are cranky. Say, lookit the mess Hozy made o'\nthat guy Hooley-o.\"\n\nKnowlton glanced at Julio and whistled. Jos\u00e9's oft-repeated threat to\ndisembowel a refractory member of the crew had at last been literally\nfulfilled.\n\nBut the lieutenant had seen worse sights in the shell-torn trenches of\nFrance, and now he kept his mind on his work. Wedging the gun to hold\nthe tourniquet tight, he lifted his patient from the red-smeared mud and\nbore him to the nearest hammock in the crew quarters. Striding back, he\nfound Tim alternately bathing McKay's head and giving him brandy. In a\nmoment the captain's eyes opened.\n\n\"Some bean ye got, Cap,\" congratulated Tim, vastly relieved at sight of\nMcKay's gray stare. \"Bullet bounced right off. Here, take another\nswaller. Attaboy! Hey, Looey, we better pack this crease o' Cap's, huh?\nShe keeps leakin'.\"\n\n\"Yep. Dip up the surgical kit. And give Jos\u00e9 a drink. I'll have to tie\nhis artery, too. How do you feel, old chap?\"\n\n\"Dizzy,\" McKay confessed. \"What's happened?\"\n\n\"Lost our crew,\" was the laconic answer. \"All gone west but Jos\u00e9, and\nhe's bled white. We'll have to paddle our own canoe now.\"\n\nFor a time after his head was bandaged McKay lay quiet, staring out at\nthe tiny battlefield and at his two mates working silently on the\nwounded arm of Jos\u00e9. When they came back he spoke one word.\n\n\"Schwandorf.\"\n\n\"Yeah! He's the nigger in the woodpile, I bet my shirt. But why? What's\nhis lay, d'ye s'pose?\"\n\n\"Perhaps Jos\u00e9 knows,\" suggested Knowlton. \"But he's in no shape to talk\nnow. Let's see. Schwandorf said he was going to Iquitos?\"\n\n\"Yes, but that doesn't mean anything.\"\n\n\"Probably not. Well, maybe Jos\u00e9 can explain.\"\n\nThere were some things, however, which Jos\u00e9 could not have told if he\nwould, for he himself did not know them. One was that Schwandorf really\nhad gone to Iquitos, where was a radio station. Another was that from\nthat radio station to Puerto Bermudez, thence over the Andes to the\ncoast, and northward to a New York address memorized from Knowlton's\nnotebook, already had gone this message:\n\n     McKay expedition killed by Indians. Rand search most dangerous, but\n     if empowered I attempt locate him for fifty thousand gold payable\n     on safe delivery Rand at Manaos. Reply soon a possible.\n\n     KARL SCHWANDORF.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nTHE DOUBLE-CROSS\n\n\nNoon, sweltering hot. A blazing sun pouring vertical rays down on a\nblinding river. A long canoe wearily creeping up the glaring waters,\nminus a lookout, heedless of the ever-present danger of sunken tree\ntrunks; propelled by three sun-blistered white men, one of whom wore a\nbandage around his head; steered perfunctorily by a pallid pirate whose\nleft arm hung in a sling. Atop the right bank an unbroken, endless\ntangle of jungle growth. Ahead, on the left shore, a gap gouged out of\nthe forest and a number of boats at the water's edge.\n\n\"Guess that's it,\" panted Knowlton, shielding his eyes and squinting at\nthe clearing. \"One more day's journey, the Brazilian chap said. We've\nbeen two and a half.\"\n\n\"One day's journey for six hardened rivermen, se\u00f1or,\" corrected Jos\u00e9.\n\"Not for three men doing six men's work and hampered by a cripple.\"\n\n\"Aw, ye're no crip, Hozy,\" dissented Tim. \"Any guy that can steer a tub\nlike this here one-handed after losin' a couple gallons o' juice is in\ngood shape yet, I'll say. If ye had both legs shot off and yer arms\nbroke and yer head stove in, now, ye might call yourself sort o'\nhelpless. Ease her over to the left a li'l' more, so's we'll hit the\nbank right at the corner o' that gap. Me, I don't want to take one\nstroke more 'n I have to. Every muscle in me is so sore it squeaks.\"\n\n\"Same here,\" admitted Knowlton. \"I'm one solid ache.\"\n\nJos\u00e9 nodded. The clumsy craft veered a bit. The three put a little more\npunch into their lagging strokes, noting, as they neared the steep bank,\nthat a couple of men had appeared at its top and were staring at them.\nGradually the long dugout worked in to the muddy shore, where the\npaddlers stabbed their blades into the clay and held it firm.\n\n\"Ahoy, up there! This the Nunes _seringal_?\"\n\nFrom the edge, some thirty feet above, the taller of the two watchers\nanswered:\n\n\"_Si_, senhor. The headquarters of the coronel. Do you come to visit\nhim?\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\n\"Then permit me to help you. The path is a little ahead. Pull up and tie\nto this stake.\"\n\nThe tall fellow came dropping swiftly downward. At the same time the\nother Brazilian stepped back and was gone.\n\nWith a dexterous twist the man of Nunes moored the boat to the\ndesignated stake. Then he reached a hand toward Tim to help him out.\n\n\"I ain't no old woman, feller,\" Tim refused, and hopped aground\nunassisted. McKay and Knowlton followed. But Jos\u00e9, after moving\nlanguidly forward and contemplating the sharp slope, hesitated and then\nshrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I am tired, se\u00f1ores,\" he said. \"And perhaps it would be well for one to\nstay here and watch.\"\n\nThe tall Brazilian's eyes narrowed.\n\n\"There is no danger of loss,\" he asserted, with dignity. \"We men of the\ncoronel are not thieves.\"\n\nThe slight emphasis of his last sentence might have been taken as an\nintimation that some one else not far away would bear watching. Jos\u00e9's\nmouth tightened. For a moment Brazilian and Peruvian eyed each other in\nobvious dislike. Then, with a glance at his crippled arm, Jos\u00e9 shrugged\nagain.\n\n\"Better come along, Jos\u00e9,\" McKay said. \"Stuff's safe enough.\"\n\n\"As you will, Capitan.\"\n\nHe lounged to the edge, hesitated, wavered slightly. At once the\nBrazilian darted out a hand and gave him support. And while the four\nclambered up the slope he retained a grip on the Peruvian's arm, aiding\nhim to the top. When they emerged on the level, however, he dropped his\nhand immediately. Jos\u00e9 gave him a half-mocking bow of thanks, to which\nhe replied with a short nod. Then he stepped back and let the Peruvian\nprecede him toward a number of substantial pole-supported houses a\nhundred yards away.\n\n\"No love lost between them two,\" thought Tim, who had watched it all.\n\"Good skate, though, this new feller. Ready to help a guy that needs it,\nwhether he likes him or not; ready to knock his block off, too, if he\nneeds that. Bet he'd be a hellion in a scrap. Dang good-lookin' lad,\ntoo.\"\n\nWherewith he introduced himself.\n\n\"Don't git sore because I growled at ye down below,\" he said, with a\nfriendly grin. \"Sounded rough, mebbe, but that's my style. I'm Tim Ryan,\nfrom the States. I bark more 'n I bite.\"\n\nThe overture met with instant response--a quick smile and a twinkle in\nthe warm eyes.\n\n\"It is not words that give offense, senhor, but the way they are\nspoken--and the man who speaks them. One man may growl, but you like\nhim. Another may speak smoothly, but you itch to strike him. Is it not\nso? I am Pedro Andrada, a _seringueiro_ who should be tapping trees\ninstead of loafing here. But my partner and I have just come in from a\nlong trip into the _sertao_--wilderness--and are resting.\"\n\n\"Yeah? Was that yer buddy I seen with ye?\"\n\n\"My--ah--buddee? Partner? Yes, that was he--Louren\u00e7o Moraes, the best\ncomrade one ever had. He has gone to tell the coronel of your arrival.\nHave you met with an accident downriver?\"\n\nHe moved a thumb meaningly toward the only remaining member of the crew.\n\n\"Yeah,\" grimly. \"Bad accident.\"\n\nTim tapped his pistol significently, raised five fingers, winked, and\ntwitched his head toward the Peruvian. Pedro lifted his brows, nodded\nquick understanding, pointed to the bad arm of Jos\u00e9, and made motions as\nif pulling a trigger. Tim shook his head and enacted the pantomime of\ndrawing and throwing a knife. Whereat the Brazilian, aware that Jos\u00e9 was\nnot a prisoner and probably knowing that North Americans were not knife\nthrowers, looked much puzzled. But their sign manual went no farther,\nfor they now approached the house which evidently formed the dwelling\nand office of Coronel Nunes.\n\nAt the foot of the ladder stood a broad-shouldered, square-jawed,\nthick-muscled, deeply tanned man, who, without speaking, pointed a thumb\nupward. Above, in the doorway, waited an elderly Brazilian of medium\nheight and spare figure, standing with soldierly erectness and garbed in\nwhite duck of semimilitary cut. He beamed down at McKay and Knowlton,\nbut as his black eyes encountered those of Jos\u00e9 they seemed suddenly to\nbecome very sharp. Then his gaze rested on Tim's broad face and he\nsmiled again.\n\n\"Enter, gentlemen,\" he invited. \"_Esta casa e a suas ordenes_--this\nhouse is at your disposal.\"\n\nMcKay, with a bow, climbed the ladder, followed by Knowlton. Jos\u00e9, with\na swaggering stare at the wide-shouldered man, who stared straight back\nwithout facial change, also went up. Tim came fourth and last, for Pedro\nstopped beside his countryman, who evidently was Louren\u00e7o.\n\nThe travelers found themselves in a room which, in view of its distance\nfrom civilization, seemed palatial. Its floor was tight, its furniture\nmodern, its walls decorated with a few excellent pictures, of which the\nlargest was a superb view of the rugged harbor of Rio de Janeiro.\nComfortable chairs were ranged along the walls, and the middle of the\nroom was occupied by a massive square-cornered table on which lay a\njumble of hand-written business papers, a number of books, a high-grade\nviolin and bow. Beyond the table stood a swivel chair, evidently the\nusual seat of the coronel. Table and chair were so arranged that the\nmaster of this house sat always with his back to a wall and his face\ntoward the door. And on a couple of hooks on that wall, ready for\ninstant service, hung a high-power rifle.\n\nOn their way up the river the Americans had passed, at long intervals, a\nfew small rubber estates, whose headquarters consisted mainly of a crude\nshack or two, hardly better than the dingy houses of Remate de Males.\nThis place was more imposing. They had observed, while crossing the\ncleared space, that it was at least half a mile square; that its\nwarehouse for supplies was big and solid; that a goodly number of\n_barracaos_, or rubber workers' huts, surrounded the house of the master\nat a respectful distance; and that the owner's home was no one-room\ncabin, but big enough to contain six or eight rooms. This well-appointed\nreception room and the formal yet sincere courtesy of its owner showed\nthat Coronel Nunes was no mere native of the frontier. Later they were\nto learn that he was a gentleman of Rio who, exiling himself from the\ncapital after the death of his wife, had carved from this forbidding\njungle a fortune in the rubber trade.\n\nWith the correct touch of Latin punctilio McKay spoke the introductions\nand stated that they were on their way upriver to explore the\nhinterland. With equal politeness the coronel bowed and begged his\nillustrious guests to be seated. Then he touched a small bell. A door at\none side opened and a white-suited negro appeared.\n\n\"Caf\u00e9,\" the coronel ordered. As speedily as if these visitors had been\nlong expected, the servant brought in a tray bearing cups of syrupy\ncoffee. Each of the guests accepted one. Whereafter the decorum of the\noccasion was shattered by Tim, who, at the imminent risk of scalding\nhimself, gulped his refreshment and vociferated his satisfaction.\n\n\"O-o-oh boy! That hits right where I live! Gimme another one, feller,\nand make it man's size!\"\n\nThe black fellow struggled with his quick mirth and then laughed\noutright--the throaty, infectious laugh of his race. The coronel's eyes\ntwinkled. And when Tim fished a damp cigarette from his shirt,\nnonchalantly scraped a match on his host's table, blew a cloud of smoke,\nand sprawled back with one leg dangling over a chair arm, formality went\na-glimmering.\n\n\"_A quem madruga Deus ajuda_,\" laughed the coronel. \"Or, as you North\nAmericans put it, 'God helps those who help themselves.' Let us not be\nceremonious, gentlemen. 'Tonio, bring more coffee. And cigars. And--\"\n\nDown behind his table, where only the servant saw the motion, he\ntwitched a finger as if pulling a cork. 'Tonio, his ebony countenance\nsplit by a grin, ducked his head and vanished into the other room.\n\n\"How is the rubber market, sir?\" asked Knowlton, seeking to divert\nattention from Tim.\n\n\"Not so good,\" the old gentleman replied, with a deprecatory gesture.\n\"In truth, it is very poor since the war--so poor that soon I shall\nabandon this _seringal_ and go out to spend the rest of my life on the\ncoast. With rubber selling at a mere five hundred dollars a ton in New\nYork and the artificial plantations of the Far East growing greater\nyearly, there is no longer much profit in bleeding the wild trees of our\njungle. I really do not know why I stay here now, unless it is because I\nhave become so much accustomed to this life.\"\n\n\"Why, I understood that there was much money in rubber!\"\n\n\"You speak truth--there was. Now there is not. The world moves and times\nchange. Years ago foreigners came into Brazil, helped themselves to the\nseed of our wild trees, and planted it in Ceylon and the Malay region.\nThat seed now bears such fruit that the world is flooded with rubber.\nTen years ago, senhores, a ton sold for six thousand five hundred\ndollars. Now, in this year nineteen-twenty, the price is only\none-thirteenth of what it was in those days. It scarcely pays for the\ngathering. I hope you have not come expecting to make fortunes in\nrubber.\"\n\n\"No. We are here to find a race of men known as Red Bones.\"\n\nThe coronel's brows lifted. They kept on lifting, and he opened his lips\ntwice without speaking. After a long stare at Knowlton he looked at\nMcKay, at Tim, and finally at Jos\u00e9. A frown grew on his face. And the\nAmericans, following his look at the Peruvian, were surprised to see\nthat Jos\u00e9 himself was staring blankly at the speaker.\n\n\"Jos\u00e9 Martinez!\" snapped the coronel, leveling a finger pistollike at\nthe _puntero_. \"What devil's game are you working now?\"\n\nJos\u00e9 recovered himself and lifted his coffee cup.\n\n\"I do not understand you, Nunes,\" he replied, languidly. \"I am but the\nhumble _puntero_ of the crew engaged by these se\u00f1ores. My only work has\nbeen to earn my pay. And you may ask _el capitan_ whether I have earned\nit.\"\n\n\"Ay, he has,\" corroborated McKay. \"Killed two of his own crew in our\ndefense.\"\n\nThe coronel's jaw dropped. He blinked as if disbelieving his ears.\n\n\"He--Jos\u00e9? Not possible!\" he stuttered. \"Jos\u00e9--this man--defended you\nagainst his companions?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\nThe Brazilian slowly shook his head. Then suddenly he nodded as if an\nilluminating thought had crossed his mind.\n\n\"I see. Jos\u00e9 is very well paid.\"\n\n\"One dollar a day,\" was McKay's dry retort.\n\nAt that moment 'Tonio re-entered with a larger tray than before, bearing\nmore coffee, long cigars, and squat glasses in which glowed a golden\nliquid. Tim sat up with a grunt and helped himself with both hands. When\nthe coronel's turn came he disregarded the drinks, but lit the cigar as\nif he needed it.\n\n\"_De noite todos os gatos sao pardos_,\" he said. \"At night all cats are\ngray. I am much in the dark, gentlemen. If you would be so good as to\nenlighten me--\"\n\nHe paused, looking sidewise again at Jos\u00e9 as if the _puntero_ had\nsuddenly grown wings or horns.\n\n\"All right,\" nodded Knowlton, biting and lighting his cigar. \"We are\nsomewhat in the dark ourselves as to why Jos\u00e9 has been so zealous, for\nhe has been very taciturn since the recent fight at our camp. Perhaps\nJos\u00e9 also is a bit hazy about our expedition--he looked rather surprised\njust now. So here is the situation.\"\n\nBriefly then he outlined the object of the search, stating that the\nidentity of the mysterious Raposa was a matter of some concern to\ncertain persons in the United States and that the expedition had been\nformed with the view of settling the question. From the time of the\nlanding at Remate de Males, however, he narrated events more fully,\ngiving complete details of Schwandorf's activities, Francisco's offense,\nand the final attack by the crew. While he talked the coronel's frown\ndeepened. Also, Jos\u00e9 gradually assumed the expression of a thundercloud.\nAnd when the tale was done the _puntero_ exploded.\n\n\"_Sangre de Cristo!_\" he yelled. \"_El Aleman_--the German--he told you\nwe would go among the cannibals? We? Peruvians? _Madre de Dios!_ If ever\nI get within knife length of him! Nunes, you see, do you not?\"\n\nThe coronel nodded grimly.\n\n\"I see that he planned to have all of you destroyed. Senhor Knowlton,\nthat black-bearded and black-hearted man suggested that you take\nMayoruna women? He told you they were shapely of body and tried to put\ninto your minds the thought of making them your paramours? The snake!\n\n\"He did not tell you, then, that the Mayoruna men allow no trifling with\ntheir women; that any alien man attempting to embrace one of them would\nbe killed. But it is true. If you should succeed in establishing\nfriendly relations with the men--which is not at all likely--you would\nforfeit all friendship, and your lives as well, by the slightest\ndalliance with any of the women.\n\n\"He told you that more than one man has risked his life to win a\nMayoruna woman? That is true. But he gave you a false impression as to\nthe way in which the risk was incurred. He did not tell you that\nPeruvian _caucheros_ have sometimes raided small isolated _melocas_ of\nthe Mayorunas, shooting down the men and carrying off the girls to be\nvictims of their bestial lust. He did not tell you that for this reason\nany Peruvian is considered their enemy and is killed without mercy\nwherever found. Yet he tried to send you with Peruvian guides into their\ncountry. He knew the Peruvians would be killed on sight--and you with\nthem.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nFIDDLERS THREE\n\n\nBlack looks passed among the men as the duplicity of Schwandorf lay\nplain before their eyes. Tim growled. Jos\u00e9 hissed curses. The coronel\nwhirled to him.\n\n\"Jos\u00e9! What was his object in trying to destroy you and your crew? You\nhave been his man. You know much about him. He wanted to stop your\nmouth, yes? Dead men tell no tales.\"\n\nThe _puntero's_ eyes glittered. For a moment the others thought he was\nabout to reveal important secrets. Then his face changed.\n\n\"I know no reason why we should be killed,\" he declared.\n\n\"I do not believe you,\" the coronel declared, bluntly.\n\nJos\u00e9 shrugged, calmly drank the coronel's wine, lighted the coronel's\ncigar, leaned back in the coronel's chair, and eyed the coronel with\nimperturbable insolence.\n\n\"See here, Jos\u00e9,\" demanded McKay, \"you've had something up your sleeve\nall along. Now come clean! What is it?\"\n\nJos\u00e9 puffed airily at the cigar, saying nothing.\n\n\"What orders did Schwandorf give you?\"\n\nThis time the reply came readily enough.\n\n\"To take you twenty-four days up the river and put you ashore. To\nprevent any trouble before that time.\"\n\n\"Ah! And after that?\"\n\n\"Nothing. At least, nothing to me. What may have been said to the other\nmen I do not know. Schwandorf came to me last, after he had picked all\nthe others.\"\n\n\"And what do you know about Schwandorf?\"\n\n\"What is between me and Schwandorf will be settled between me and\nSchwandorf. My duty to you se\u00f1ores lies only in handling the crew. Now\nthat there is no crew my duty ends. Also, Capitan, I would like my pay\nnow.\"\n\n\"You quit?\"\n\n\"Why not? I have done my best. I can do no more. I am crippled. I am of\nno further use to you. Give me my pay, a little food, a small canoe, and\nI go.\"\n\n\"It is possible, Senhor Jos\u00e9,\" spoke the coronel, with ironic\npoliteness, \"that you may not go so soon. You have killed two men\nrecently. You refuse to reveal some things which should be known about\nthe German. Perhaps the law--\"\n\nJos\u00e9 burst into a jeering laugh.\n\n\"Law? You speak of law? There is no law up the river but the law of the\ngun and the knife. And if there were, se\u00f1or, what then? I killed in a\nfair fight. I killed men who would do murder. I killed on the west bank\nof the river--Peru. Neither you nor any other Brazilian can lay hand on\nme. And though I now have only one good arm, it will not be well for\nanyone to try to hold me. My knife and my right hand still are ready.\"\n\n\"By cripes! the lad's right!\" Tim blurted, impulsively. \"And I'll tell\nthe world I'm for him. He's got a right to keep his mouth shut if he\nwants to. He don't owe us nothin'. Mebbe he's got somethin' up his\nsleeve, at that; but he stuck with us in the pinch, and--\"\n\n\"And we'll give him a square deal, of course,\" Knowlton cut in. \"Jos\u00e9,\nyour own wages to this point, at a dollar a day, are eighteen dollars.\nThe wages of the five other men to the place where they--quit--would\naggregate seventy-five dollars. Grand total, ninety-three. The others\nchose to take their pay in lead instead of gold, so their account is\nclosed. Therefore I suggest that their pay go to you as _puntero_,\n_popero_, and good sport. What say, Rod?\"\n\n\"Make it a hundred flat,\" McKay agreed.\n\n\"Right. A hundred in gold. Satisfy you, Jos\u00e9?\"\n\n\"Indeed yes, se\u00f1or. I did not expect such generosity.\"\n\n\"That's all right, then. We'll fix you up before we move on, and--Say!\nAre you in Schwandorf's pay, too?\"\n\nJos\u00e9 hesitated. Then he replied:\n\n\"Since you mention it, I will admit that _el Aleman_ offered me certain\ninducements to make this journey. I now see that he had no intention of\nmeeting his promises. But you can leave it to me to collect from him\nwhatever may be due.\"\n\nEven the coronel nodded at this. The gleam in the Peruvian's eyes\npresaged unpleasantness for Schwandorf.\n\n\"You gentlemen, of course, will not attempt to continue your journey for\nthe present,\" the coronel suggested. \"You are fatigued and I shall\ngreatly appreciate the pleasure of your companionship. New arrangements\nalso will be necessary in the matter of a boat and men.\"\n\n\"We've been wondering about getting another boat and a new crew,\"\nKnowlton said, frankly. \"The canoe we have is too big for three men to\nhandle, and I'll admit we're tired. Jos\u00e9, too, is in no shape to travel\nyet--\"\n\n\"Jos\u00e9, of course, is my guest also,\" the old gentleman interrupted. \"The\nquestion of new men can be solved. But there is time for everything, and\nnow is the time for all of you to rest. As our proverb has it, '_Devagar\nse vae ao longe_'--he goes far who goes slowly.\"\n\nMcKay arose, glass in hand.\n\n\"To our host,\" he bowed. The toast was drunk standing. Whereafter the\nhost tapped the bell twice and 'Tonio reappeared with a tray of fresh\nglasses. A toast to the United States by the coronel followed, and as\nsoon as the black man arrived with a third round the Republic of Brazil\nwas pledged. Then the coronel directed the servant:\n\n\"'Tonio, if Pedro and Louren\u00e7o are outside, ask them to move the\nbelongings of the gentlemen from the canoe. And make ready rooms for the\nguests.\"\n\n'Tonio disappeared down the ladder. The coronel raised the violin,\ntendered it to the others, accepted their pleas to play it himself, and\nfor the next half hour acquitted himself with no mean ability. Snatches\nof long-forgotten operas and improvisations of his own flowed from the\nstrings in smooth harmony, hinting at bygone years amid far different\nsurroundings for which his soul now hungered and to which he would\nreturn. Pedro and Louren\u00e7o, transporting the equipment, passed in and\nout soft-footed and almost unnoticed. At length the player, with a\ndeprecatory smile and a half apology for \"boring his guests,\" extended\nthe instrument again toward the visitors. And McKay, silent McKay, took\nit.\n\nSweet and low, out welled the haunting melody of \"Annie Laurie.\" Tim,\nwho had listened with casual interest to the coronel's music, now\ngrinned happily. And when the plaintive Scotch song became \"Kathleen\nMavourneen\" he closed his eyes and lay back in pure enjoyment. \"The\nRiver Shannon\" flowed into \"The Suwanee River,\" and this in turn blended\ninto other heart-tugging airs of Dixieland. When the last strain died\nand the captain reached for his half-smoked cigar the room was silent\nfor minutes.\n\nThen, to the astonishment of all, Jos\u00e9 spoke:\n\n\"Se\u00f1ores, there was a time when I, too, could draw music from the\nviolin. If I may--\" His eyes rested longingly on the instrument.\n\n\"_Certamente_, if you can use the arm,\" the coronel acquiesced. With a\nlittle difficulty Jos\u00e9 drew his arm from the sling, balanced his left\nelbow on the chair arm, and poised the violin. A half smile showed in\nthe eyes of the coronel as he glanced at his guests. He, and they as\nwell, expected a discordant, uncouth attempt to scrape out some obscene\nditty of the frontier.\n\nBut as Jos\u00e9, after jockeying a bit, began drifting the bow across the\nstrings, the suppressed smiles faded and eyes opened. Here was a man\nwho, as he said, once could play. And he wasted no time on airs composed\nby others and known to half the world. Under his touch the mellow wood\nbegan to talk, and in the minds of the listeners grew pictures.\n\nCity streets, blank-walled houses, patios, the rattle of the hoofs of\nburros over cobbles, the shuffle of human feet, the toll of bells from a\nconvent tower. Gay little bits of music, laughter, flashing eyes, a\nvoluptuous love song repeated over and over. A sudden wild outbreak,\nfighting men, shots, the clash of steel--again a tolling bell and a\nrequiem for the dead. A horse galloping in the night. Mountain winds\ncrooning mournfully, rising to the scream of tempest and the crash of\nthunder. Dreary uplands, the hiss of rain, the sough of drifting snow,\nthe patient plod of a mule along a perilous trail. And then the jungle:\nits discordant uproar, its hammering of frogs, its hoots and howls, the\ndismal swash of flood waters. A monotonous ebb and flow of life,\npunctuated by sudden flares of fight. Then a long, mournful wail--and\nsilence.\n\nHis bow still on the strings, Jos\u00e9 sat for a minute like a stone image,\nhis eyes straight ahead, his pale face drawn, his red kerchief glowing\ndully in the semishadow like a cap of blood. For once his face was empty\nof all insolence, changed by a pathetic wistfulness that made it tragic.\nThen, wordless, he lowered the violin, held it out to the coronel,\nfumbled absently at his sling, and slowly incased his wounded arm. When\nhe looked up his old mocking expression had come back and he once more\nlooked the reckless buccaneer.\n\nFor a time no one spoke. Each felt that he had glimpsed something of\nthis man's past; felt, too, that he who now was a bloody-handed borderer\nhad once been a _caballero_, moving in a much higher circle. Certainly\nhe could not play like this unless he had been of the upper class in his\nyouth. The coronel's face was thoughtful as he took back the violin.\nWhen at length he began to talk, however, it was on a topic as remote as\npossible from music and present personalities--the reconstruction of\nEurope as the result of the World War.\n\nWith this and kindred subjects, aided by the attentive ministrations of\n'Tonio, the afternoon passed swiftly. Dinner proved a feast, the _pi\u00e8ce\nde r\u00e9sistance_ being tender, well-cooked meat which the Americans took\nfor roast beef, but which really was roast tapir. More cigars, coupled\nwith the fatigue of the past two days of paddling, eventually caused the\nvisitors to seek their rooms, where McKay and Knowlton paired off and\nTim took Jos\u00e9 as his \"bunkie.\"\n\nWhen Tim awoke the next morning he found himself deserted.\n\nTo Knowlton, who drew from the small gold-chest the hundred dollars\nallotted to Jos\u00e9 and handed it to him before redressing his wound, the\n_puntero_ quietly revealed his intention to go before sunrise.\n\n\"Say nothing, se\u00f1or,\" he requested. \"You need know nothing of it, if you\nlike. I am here to-night--I am gone to-morrow--that is all. I am of no\nfurther use to you, I am unwelcome in this house of Nunes, and I go. Oh,\nhave no fear for me! I have my gun, my knife, and my good right arm, and\nI can take care of myself very well. No doubt the coronel will be\nastonished to find that on leaving to-night I have neither cut anyone's\nthroat nor stolen anything--ha! I have a black name on this river, and\nit is well earned, perhaps. Yet few men are as bad as those who dislike\nthem think they are. I may borrow a small canoe, but any Indian would do\nthe same. An unoccupied canoe is any man's property.\n\n\"Before our ways part, se\u00f1or, let me say that as Jos\u00e9 Martinez never\nforgets his enemies, so he never forgets friends. Where some men would\nhave turned me loose like a sick dog with my eighteen dollars, you and\nSe\u00f1or McKay give me a hundred. And far more than that, you saved my life\nat a time when many men would have said, 'Bah! let the bloody one die!\nHe is nothing but scum of the border and leader of that murdering crew.'\nYou had only to let me lie a few minutes longer and you would be rid of\nme. No, Jos\u00e9 does not forget.\n\n\"That is all, except--if you will, in parting, take the hand of a man\nknown as a killer and other things--\"\n\nKnowlton gripped that hand with swift heartiness. He would have\nprotested against such a departure, but the other's steady gaze\nbetokened inflexible purpose. So he merely said:\n\n\"Then good luck, old chap! And if you meet Schwandorf give him our\naffectionate regards.\"\n\n\"_Si_, se\u00f1or,\" was the sardonic answer. \"I will do that thing. And here\nis something that may be of interest to you. I happen to know that\nbefore we left Remate de Males a swift one-man canoe left Nazareth, and\nthat the man in it was an Indian who is in the German's control. It went\nupstream while we were loading your supplies, and it has not returned.\nBy this time it must be many hours above this place. I do not know what\nmessage that Indian carries, nor where he goes. But he is a short man,\nand his left leg is crooked. If you meet such a one make him talk.\nGood-by, se\u00f1or.\"\n\nJust how and when the _puntero_ cat-footed his way out that night none\never knew but himself. But before the next dawn he had vanished from the\nBrazilian shore.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nBY THE LIGHT OF STORM\n\n\n\"One thing I can't understand,\" Knowlton said, toying with his coffee\ncup the next morning, \"is why Schwandorf should double-cross us. We\nnever did anything to him. Another thing I don't quite get is how he\nexpected to have the Peruvians wiped out when he knew blamed well they\nwere aware of the enmity of the cannibals. They'd hardly be likely to go\ninto the bush with us under those circumstances.\"\n\n\"My guess is this,\" McKay replied. \"He set a trap. He is on a friendly\nfooting with some of the savages above here, no doubt. He dispatched\nthat Indian messenger to stir them up with some false tale and bring\nthem to some place where they'd be pretty sure to get us. He primed the\ncrew to jump us at the same place, perhaps. Then the crew would kill us\nor we'd kill them, and whichever side won would be smeared by the\nIndians. Sort of a trap within a trap. Why he did it doesn't matter\nmuch. He double-crossed us, he double-crossed the crew, he\ndouble-crossed Jos\u00e9. First thing he knows he'll find he's double-crossed\nhimself.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Tim grunted. \"He better beat it before we git back!\"\n\n\"He wanted no killing before we reached the cannibal country,\" McKay\nwent on, \"because then it would all be blamed on the savages and he\ncould show clean hands. Francisco's vengefulness tipped over his cart.\"\n\n\"Still, he might have known we'd stop here for a call on the coronel,\nand that there was a big chance for us to be warned here about the feud\nbetween Mayorunas and Peruvians.\"\n\n\"That probably was provided for. Crew doubtless had orders to prevent\nany such visit, by lying to us or in other ways. We probably would have\ngone surging past here at top speed.\"\n\n\"Wal, it don't git us nothin' to talk about things that 'ain't\nhappened,\" interposed the practical Tim. \"Question is, where do we go\nfrom here? And how?\"\n\nAll eyes went to the coronel, who sat languidly smoking his morning\ncigar.\n\n\"Coronel, we are in your hands,\" McKay said, bluntly. \"Your men, I\npresume, are all out at work in various parts of the bush. We want a\ncrew and, if possible, guides. Can you help us?\"\n\nThe coronel flicked off an ash and spoke slowly:\n\n\"I have two men, senhores, who have no peers as bushmen. They are the\ntwo whom you saw yesterday. Frankly, they are most valuable to me, and I\nhesitate about sending them on so dangerous a mission as yours. Yet they\nmight succeed where most men would fail, for they have repeatedly gone\ninto the bush on risky journeys and returned unharmed. Their adventures\nwould fill books.\n\n\"The older of these two, Louren\u00e7o Moraes, has been more than once among\nthe cannibals of this region, and so he knows something of them.\nNaturally he did not live long among them; he left them as soon as he\ncould. But he has the faculty of extricating himself from hopeless\npositions--or perhaps it would be better to say that his cool head and\ngood fortune together have preserved him thus far. '_Tanta vez vae o\ncantaro a fonte ate gue um dia la fica_'--the pitcher may go often to\nthe spring, but some day it remains there.\n\n\"Pedro Andrada, the younger, is not so steady and cool-headed as\nLouren\u00e7o. Yet he is a most capable man, and the two together--they are\nalways together--make a very efficient team.\"\n\n\"I bet they do,\" Tim concurred, heartily. \"I like that Pedro lad fine.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" the coronel smiled. \"Now, gentlemen, I will not order these\nmen to go with you. If they go it must be of their own choice. They have\nonly recently returned from a hazardous mission and they are entitled to\nrest. Yet I have little doubt that they will jump at the chance to risk\ntheir lives in a new venture. If they choose to go, I suggest that you\nplace yourselves entirely in their hands and give them free rein. You\nwould look far for better men.\"\n\n\"And we're lucky to get them,\" Knowlton acquiesced. \"To them and to you\nwe shall be greatly indebted.\"\n\n\"Not to me, senhor,\" the coronel demurred \"I do nothing but bring you\nmen together. Theirs is the risk. 'Tonio! Find Pedro and Louren\u00e7o. Shall\nwe go into the office, gentlemen?\"\n\nChairs scraped back and an exodus from the dining room ensued. Outside,\nthe lusty voice of the negro bawled. Soon he was back, and at his heels\nstrode the lithe Pedro and the quiet Louren\u00e7o. They ran their eyes over\nthe group, then stood looking inquiringly at their employer.\n\n\"Be seated, men. Roll cigarettes if you like,\" said the coronel. Coolly\nthey did both. Pedro, catching Tim's friendly grin, flashed a quick\nsmile in return. Louren\u00e7o, unsmiling, looked squarely into each man's\nface in turn and seemed satisfied with what he saw. Both then glanced\naround as if missing some one.\n\n\"Your friend Jos\u00e9 has left us,\" the coronel informed them, dryly,\ninterpreting the look. \"He disappeared in the night.\"\n\n\"Ah! That is why one of our canoes is gone,\" said Pedro. \"We are ready\nto start.\"\n\n\"You mistake,\" the old gentleman laughed. \"We do not want him back.\nNothing else is missing.\"\n\nWhereat Pedro looked slightly surprised. Louren\u00e7o's lips curved in a\nfaint grin. Neither made any further comment.\n\nThe coronel plunged at once into the business for which they had been\nsummoned. Succinctly he stated the purpose of the North Americans in\ncoming here, pointed out their need of guides--and stopped there. He\nsaid nothing of the dangers ahead, mentioned no reward, did not even ask\nthe men whether they would go. He merely lit a fresh cigar and leaned\nback in his chair.\n\nA silence followed. Again Louren\u00e7o looked searchingly into the face of\neach American. Pedro contemplated the opposite wall, taking occasional\npuffs from his cigarette. At length Knowlton suggested, tentatively:\n\n\"We will pay well--\"\n\nBoth the bushmen frowned. The coronel spoke in a tone of mild reproof:\n\n\"Senhor, it is not a matter of pay. These men can make plenty of money\nas _seringueiros_.\"\n\n\"Pardon,\" said Knowlton, and thereafter held his tongue.\n\nDeliberately Louren\u00e7o finished his smoke, pinched the coal between a\nhard thumb and forefinger, and spoke for the first time.\n\n\"May I ask, senhor, if you are the commander?\" His gaze rested on McKay.\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"And do I understand that we shall at all times be subject to your\norders?\"\n\n\"In case any orders are necessary--yes. But I assume that you will not\nneed commands.\"\n\nA quiet smile showed in the bushman's eyes. He glanced at Pedro. The\nlatter met the look from the corner of his eye, without wink, nod, or\nother sign. But when Louren\u00e7o turned again to McKay he spoke as if all\nwere arranged.\n\n\"When do we start, Capitao?\"\n\nTim slapped his leg and cackled.\n\n\"By cripes! there ain't no lost motion with these guys. Hey, Cap?\"\n\nMcKay smiled approvingly.\n\n\"We shall get on together\" he said. \"Louren\u00e7o and Pedro, this is not a\none-man party. We are three comrades, who now become five. If at any\ntime one man needs to command, I, as senior officer, will take that\ncommand. Otherwise we are all on an equal footing.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" Louren\u00e7o agreed. \"If it were otherwise you would still be\nthree men--not five. Since that is plain, let me say frankly that your\nbig canoe had best stay here, also everything you do not need in the\nbush. Two light canoes are faster, easier to handle and to hide. Pedro\nand I have our own canoe and will provide our own supplies. We will pick\nout a three-man boat for you and load it with what you select from your\nequipment. After that every man swings his own paddle.\"\n\n\"_Cada qual por si e Deus por todos._ Each for himself and God for us\nall,\" Pedro summarized.\n\n\"That's the dope,\" applauded Tim. \"Now say, Renzo, old feller, what d'ye\nknow about these here, now, Red Bones up above here? And have ye got\nanything on that Raposy guy?\"\n\nLouren\u00e7o shook his head.\n\n\"I know little of the Red Bone people, for I have never met them. That\nis one reason why I now should like to meet them. I have heard of them,\nyes; and the things I have heard are not pleasant. Yet it may be that\nthe tales are worse than the people. I have also heard terrible stories\nof the light-skinned cannibals, the Mayorunas; yet I have been among the\ncannibals and found them not so bad--though it is true that they eat the\nflesh of their enemies; I have seen it done. But it makes a very great\ndifference how they are approached and who the men are who approach\nthem. It is possible that we may go unharmed among even _los Ossos\nVermelhos_--the Red Bones. We shall see.\n\n\"Of the Raposa I think I do know something. I have seen him.\"\n\nEveryone except Pedro sat up with a start.\n\n\"You have seen him?\" exclaimed the coronel. \"When? Where? How? Why have\nyou not spoken of it?\"\n\n\"Because, Coronel, I forgot it until now. It meant nothing to us--yes,\nPedro was with me--except that it was one more queer thing in the bush.\nIn time I might have remembered it and told you. But you know we have\nbeen busy.\"\n\n\"True. But go on.\"\n\n\"It was only a little time ago. We were returning from the scouting trip\non which you sent us to locate new rubber trees. We were\nseven--eight--seven--\"\n\n\"Eight days' journey from here,\" prompted Pedro.\n\n\"_Si._ We were in our canoe when a sudden storm broke and we got\nashore to wait until it was over. The place was on an _ygarap\u00e9_--a\ncreek--about two days away from the river. The trees were large and the\nground free from bush. In a flash of lightning we saw a man peering out\nat us from a hollow tree.\n\n\"He was naked and streaked with paint--that was all we saw in the\nflashes that came and went. The rain was heavy, and we stayed where we\nwere until it ended. Then we ordered that man to come out.\n\n\"He came, and he held bow and arrow ready to shoot. We, too, were ready\nto shoot, but we held back our bullets and he held back his arrow. We\nsaw that his paint was red and that it traced his bones; that his skin\nwas that of a tanned white man and his hair was dark with a white streak\nover one ear. No, we did not notice the color of his eyes--the light was\nnot good and he stood well away from us.\n\n\"We looked around for other men, but saw none. We asked him who he was\nand what he wanted, but he gave no answer. He looked at us for a long\ntime, and we at him. Then he began walking away sidewise, watching us\nsteadily, holding his arrow always ready. Finally he disappeared among\nthe trees and we saw him no more. But we heard him, senhores; twice\nbefore we lost sight of him he spoke out in a queer voice like that of a\nparrot. And the thing he said was, 'Poor Davey!'\"\n\nMcKay thumped a fist on his chair.\n\n\"Davey! David Rand!\"\n\n\"Perhaps so, Capitao. I do not know. But he spoke English.\"\n\n\"By thunder! David Rand! Merry, where's that picture?\"\n\nKnowlton was already unbuttoning his pocket flap. Quickly he produced\nthe photograph.\n\n\"That the fellow?\"\n\nLouren\u00e7o studied the face. The eagerly anticipated affirmative did not\ncome.\n\n\"I cannot say surely. This is a full-faced, clean-shaven man with hair\nclose trimmed. That one's face was gaunt, covered partly with beard and\npartly by long hair, and we were not close to him, as I have said. I\nwould not say the two were the same until I could have a better look at\nthe wild man.\"\n\n\"You didn't follow him?\"\n\n\"No. Why should we? He had done nothing to us and we let him go his way.\nWe did look at his hollow tree, though. But it was only an empty tree,\nnot his home; a place where he had stepped in out of the storm. We had\nother things to do, so we got into our canoe again and paddled off.\"\n\n\"You can find the place again?\"\n\n\"Yes. But I much doubt if we shall find him there.\"\n\n\"Never mind. We've something to start with now, and that's worth a lot.\nGet busy with your boats and supplies, boys, right away. Tim and Merry,\nlet's dig out our essentials and start. We're on a hot trail at last.\nLet's go!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nOUT OF THE AIR\n\n\nAgain the sun fought the mists of a new day, casting a pallid, watery\nlight on the livid green roof of the limitless jungle. High up under\nthat roof, more than a hundred feet above the ground, the morning alarm\nclock went off with a scream, the sudden chorus of monkeys and macaws\nawaking after a few hours of silence. Down on the eastern shore of the\nriver, in a little natural port where the shadows still lay thick, men\nstirred under their black mosquito nets, yawned, and waited for more\nlight before starting another day's journey.\n\nTo three of the five men housed under those flimsy coverings the somber\nhue of their nets was new. On leaving Remate de Males the insect bars\nhad been clean white; and though they had grown somewhat soiled from\ndaily handling, they never had approached the drab dinginess of the\nbarriers draping the hammocks of the Peruvian rivermen. In fact, their\nowners had been at some pains to keep them as clean as possible, folding\nthem each morning with military precision and stowing them carefully.\nWherefore they were somewhat taken aback when informed that nice white\nnets were decidedly not the thing in this part of the world.\n\n\"Up to this place, senhores, they have done no harm,\" Pedro said, before\nleaving the coronel's grounds. \"But from here on they will not do at\nall. The weakest moonlight--yes, even starlight--would make them stand\nout in the darkness like tombstones. A few days more and we shall be in\nthe cannibal country. And it is an old trick of those eaters of men to\nskulk along the shore by night, watching a camp until all are asleep,\nand then sneak up with spears ready. A rush and a swift stab of the\nspears into those white nets, and you are dead or dying from the\npoisoned points. I would no more sleep under a white net than I would\nlie in my hammock and blow a horn to show where I was. Your light nets\nmust stay here. We will find dark ones for you.\"\n\nThus the voyagers learned another of those little things on which\nsometimes hinges life or death. Even McKay, with his experience of other\njungles, had never thought it necessary to drape himself in invisibility\nat night. But when his attention was called to it he recognized its\nvalue at once, and the white nets were forthwith abandoned.\n\nNow, on the first morning out from the Nunes place, the three Americans\nstretched themselves in lazy enjoyment after a night passed without a\nsentinel. The stretching evoked sundry grunts due to the discovery that\ntheir muscles still were lame. The long steamer journey from their own\nland, followed by the daily confinement of the Peruvian canoe, had\nafforded scant opportunity for keeping themselves fit, and the sudden\nnecessity for doing their own paddling had found every man soft. But\nthey now were hardening fast, and the steady swing of the paddles was\nproving a physical joy. These were men ill accustomed to sitting in\nenforced idleness for weeks on end.\n\nMatches flared under the nets and cigarette smoke drifted into the air,\nrousing to fresh activity the mosquitoes humming hungrily outside.\nGradually the shadows paled and the weak light reflecting from the\nfog-shrouded water beyond grew into day. The nets lifted and the\nbloodthirsty insects swooped in vicious triumph on the emerging men. But\nagain matches blazed, flame licked up among kindlings, a fire grew, and\nin its smoke screen the voyagers found some surcease from the bug\nhordes. Soon the fragrance of coffee floated into the air.\n\nTim yawned, coughed explosively, and swore.\n\n\"Fellers can't even take a gape for himself without gittin' these cussed\nbugs down his throat,\" he complained, and coughed again. \"Gimme some\ncoffee! I got one skeeter the size of a devil's darnin' needle stuck in\nme windpipe.\"\n\n\"A devil's darning needle? What is that, Senhor Tim?\" inquired Pedro,\npassing him a cup of hot coffee. When the liquid--and the \"skeeter\"--had\npassed into Tim's stomach he enlightened the inquirer.\n\n\"Ye dunno what's a devil's darnin' needle? Gosh! I'm s'prised at ye. I\nseen lots of 'em right on this here river. He's a bug about so long\"--he\nstuck out a finger--\"and he's got jaws like a crab and a long limber\ntail a with reg'lar needle in the end, and inside him is a roll o' tough\nsilk--tough as spider web. And he's death on liars. Any time a feller\ntells a lie he's got to look out, or all to oncet one o' them bugs'll\ncome scootin' at him and grab him by the nose with them jaws. Then he'll\ncurl up his tail--the bug, I mean--and run his needle and thread right\nthrough the feller's lips and sew his mouth up tight. Then he flies off\nlookin' for another liar.\"\n\n\"_Por Deus!_ And the liar starves to death?\"\n\n\"Wal, no. O' course he can git somebody to cut the stitches. But the\nneedle is a good thick one and it leaves a row o' holes all along the\nfeller's lips. Any time ye see a guy with li'l' round scars around his\nmouth, Pedro, ye'll know he's such an awful liar the devil bug got him.\"\n\nMcKay coughed. Knowlton blew his nose into a big handkerchief. Louren\u00e7o\nsquinted sidewise at Tim, who was solemn as an owl. Pedro, his eyes\ntwinkling, bent forward and scrutinized Tim's mouth.\n\n\"You have been fortunate, senhor,\" he said, simply--and stepped around\nto the other side of the fire.\n\n\"Huh? Say, lookit here, ye long-legged gorilla--\"\n\nKnowlton exploded. McKay and Louren\u00e7o snickered.\n\n\"It's on you, Tim!\" vociferated Knowlton. \"You dug the hole yourself.\nNow crawl in and pull it in after you.\"\n\nTim snorted wrathfully, but his eyes laughed.\n\n\"Aw, what's the use o' trying to educate you guys?\"\n\n\"You swallowed a mosquito just now, but I cannot swallow that devil\nbug,\" Pedro grinned.\n\nTim rumbled something, solaced himself with a cigarette, then squatted\nand joined the others in their frugal breakfast of coffee and\n_chibeh_--a handful of farinha mixed with water in a gourd. When it was\nfinished McKay, who never smoked in the morning until he had eaten,\nfilled a pipe and suggested:\n\n\"Guess we'd better plan our campaign. We didn't take time yesterday. In\ncase we find no trace of the Raposa at the place where you fellows saw\nhim, what's your idea?\"\n\nLouren\u00e7o, puffing thoughtfully, stared into the fire.\n\n\"There will be time enough to decide that, Capitao, after we have\nvisited that place,\" he said, slowly. \"Still, perhaps it is best to make\nsome plan; it can be changed at any time.\"\n\nFor a moment longer he looked at the dying flame. Then, dropping his\ncigarette stub into it, he continued:\n\n\"If I were going alone to find a man among the Red Bones, I should go\nfirst to the Mayorunas and work through them to make sure of a friendly\nreception by the other people. I would--\"\n\n\"Why, that's the very thing Schwandorf suggested!\"\n\n\"Yes? I have not heard what he said. Tell me.\"\n\nMcKay did so. Louren\u00e7o smiled.\n\n\"Sometimes, Capitao, the devil puts into the hands of men a weapon which\nis turned against himself. So it is now. That _Allemao_, Schwandorf,\nnever expected you to reach the people you seek, but the plan is good.\nIt would not be good if you followed it exactly as he laid it out, but\nthings have changed; and what you could not do with Peruvian companions,\nor alone, you perhaps can do with us. I will show you.\n\n\"It happens that I have been twice among the cannibals living in a\ncertain _maloca_ which I can find again. Perhaps you know that those\npeople live in scattered _malocas_, each ruled by its own chief--\"\n\n\"Yes, we know about that.\"\n\n\"Good. Now if we went to any _maloca_ where we were not known we might\nbe killed at once. But at that _maloca_ of which I speak I am known to\nthe chief and all his fighting men, for I once led them on a raid into\nPeru. So they will remember me--\"\n\n\"What's that?\" Knowlton interrupted, in amazement. \"You led a cannibal\ntribe on the warpath?\"\n\n\"Just so, senhor. It is a long story, but these are the facts:\n\n\"There was in Peru a gang of killers, robbers--and worse--who called\nthemselves the Peccaries. They raided one of the coronel's camps where I\nwas in charge, killed all my gang except myself and one other, and used\nus two as slaves and beasts of burden.\n\n\"The other man died from poison. I lived only to revenge myself on those\nfoul outlaws. There was much rubber of the coronel's, worth much money\nat that time, in the camp they had raided. So, after driving me like a\nbeast to their stronghold in the hills of Peru, they came back with\nboats and Indian porters to get out that rubber.\n\n\"On that return journey I tried to kill the leader, who was called El\nAmarillo--yellow-skinned. I failed, and he had me nailed with long\nthorns to a tree where I might hang in torment for days, dying slowly.\nSee. Here are the marks.\"\n\nAll three of the Americans had noticed on the previous day that each of\nLouren\u00e7o's hands was disfigured by a scar which looked as if a spike had\nbeen driven through. Now he held those hands forward for their\ninspection. Then he pulled off his loose shirt and rolled up his\ntrousers. They saw other scars in the big muscles before the armpits, in\nthe soft flesh under the ribs, in the thighs and calves.\n\n\"The dirty Hun!\" Tim grated.\n\n\"That was not all, Senhor Tim. They also put fire ants on me, which bit\nso cruelly that I nearly lost my mind from pain. Then they went on,\nintending to have more sport with me when they came back with the\nrubber. But after they left me two hunters of the cannibal tribe who had\nbeen following a tapir's track found me and took me down from the tree.\n\n\"Now the Peccaries before this had stolen some women from a Mayoruna\n_maloca_ and were treating them like dogs--I saw one of those women\nbrutally murdered while I was captive in the outlaw camp. I managed to\ntell the two hunters I could lead them to the Peccary stronghold and\ngive them revenge. They carried me to their _maloca_--I could not\nwalk--and told their chief what I had said. The chief caused my hurts to\nbe cured, and then I kept my promise.\n\n\"I guided the savages to the outlaw camp; they surrounded it, and in the\nfight that followed every Peccary was killed except their leader. Now\nthat cannibal chief has not forgotten me--\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" protested Knowlton. \"Did that Peccary leader escape?\"\n\n\"No. He was kept alive until a big herd of peccaries was met. Then,\nbecause he called himself 'King of the Peccaries,' he was nailed to a\ntree, as I had been, and told to make the peccaries take out the thorns.\nThe wild pigs tore him into ribbons with their tusks.\"\n\nCalmly he donned his shirt again. Tim, staring at him, twitched his\nshoulders as if a chill had gone down his back.\n\n\"Ugh!\" muttered Knowlton.\n\n\"So now,\" Louren\u00e7o resumed, \"if I can find that chief again--he may have\nbeen killed in some tribal fight before now--he may be friendly to all\nof us. Or he may not. Savages cannot be relied on with much certainty.\nBut if any of the Mayorunas will help us, he will. It is worth trying.\"\n\n\"And if he is not friendly--\" Knowlton paused.\n\n\"We do not come back,\" Pedro finished. \"Have you a better plan?\"\n\nAll shook their heads.\n\n\"Laurenco's idea is excellent,\" said McKay. \"I was thinking along the\nsame line, though I did not know he had any such friendly relations with\na chief. That makes it all the more advisable to try it, unless we find\nthe Raposa first. We, of course, will not land at the place where\nSchwandorf told us to go ashore, seven days from here.\"\n\n\"By no means,\" Louren\u00e7o concurred. \"In five days we leave the river and\ntravel along the _ygarap\u00e9_. If we go to the _maloca_ it will be from\nanother direction than the river.\"\n\nHe began preparing to travel. The others also went about the work of\nbreaking camp. By the time the canoes were loaded the mists had lifted\nand the river lay open and empty before them. In the bush around and\nbeyond, gloom still lay thick and the forest life yelped, howled,\nclattered, and wailed. But out on the water it was broad day, and far\noverhead sounded the harsh cries of unseen parrots flying two by two in\nthe sunlight above the matted branches. The world of the pathless tropic\nwilderness, ever dying, ever living, was about its daily business. The\nfive invaders were about theirs.\n\nAs the paddlers dipped, however, Knowlton held back.\n\n\"Say, Rod, we didn't tell these fellows about Schwandorf's Indian. Hold\nup a second, men.\"\n\nWhile all rested on their paddles he spoke of the mysterious messenger\ndispatched from Nazareth. Pedro and Louren\u00e7o contemplated the river,\nthen frowned.\n\n\"That may be of importance, senhores,\" said Louren\u00e7o. \"It may change\neverything for us. We saw a lone Indian go past the coronel's place,\ntraveling fast, three days before you came. I would give much to know\nwhere he is now and what word he carries. A short man with a bad left\nleg, you say. We shall keep watch for such a man. Perhaps we may meet\nhim.\"\n\nWherein he predicted more accurately than he knew.\n\nThe canoes swung out and the paddlers settled into the steady stroke to\nwhich they were growing accustomed. Hour after hour they forged on, the\nBrazilians adjusting their speed to that of the Americans, who had not\nyet attained the muscular ease of habitual canoemen. The miles flowed\nslowly but surely behind them, the sun rolled higher and hotter, the\nsilence of approaching noon crept over the jungle on either side. Then,\nas the time drew near when they would land for a more hearty meal than\nthat of the morning, Pedro pointed ahead.\n\nUp out of the bush on the Peruvian shore rose a vulture. It flapped\nsullenly away as if disappointed. The bushmen, quick to note anything\nthat might be a sign, paid no attention to the bird's flight, but marked\nwith unerring eye the spot whence it had taken wing.\n\n\"Let us cross, comrades, and see what we may see,\" Pedro called. \"If\nnothing is there, we can eat.\"\n\nBut something was there. All saw it before they landed--the stern of a\nsmall, speedy canoe almost concealed in a narrow rift at the bottom of\nthe bank. In the soil of the rising slope were the prints of bare feet.\nAnd Pedro, scanning the tracks narrowly after he and the others reached\nshore, asserted, \"These were not made to-day.\"\n\nUp the bank they climbed, silent and watchful. At the top Louren\u00e7o took\nthe lead. In under big trees the five passed in file. A short distance\nfrom the edge Louren\u00e7o stopped, looking at the ground. The others spread\nout and stared at the thing he had found.\n\nBetween the buttress roots of a tall tree was a crude shelter of palm\nleaves. Before this lay the scattered bones of a man. The skull had been\ncrushed by a mighty blow.\n\nThe bones were picked clean--had been stripped and torn asunder days\nbefore, and the vulture which had just left had gotten nothing for its\nbelated visit. Among them were remnants of cloth, a belt and a machete,\nand strands of coarse black hair. A few feet away lay a cheap \"trade\"\ngun. Louren\u00e7o inspected the weapon and laid it back.\n\n\"Did he shoot before he was downed?\" asked Knowlton.\n\n\"No. The gun is loaded. His death came from above.\" The bushman ran his\neye up the towering tree, then pointed to a large dark object on the\nground near by.\n\n\"Castanha--Brazil-nut tree,\" he explained. \"That heavy nut fell and\nsmashed the Indian's skull like an egg. Indian, yes. His gun, his\nshelter, and his hair show that. And\"--stooping and pointing at one of\nthe bones--\"that bone shows who he was. See, Capitao.\"\n\nMcKay looked down on a leg bone. At some time the leg had been broken\nand badly set, if set at all. The bone was crooked.\n\n\"A short Indian with a crooked leg. Schwandorf's messenger!\"\n\n\"_Si._ No man will ever receive the message he bore. He camped here days\nago. Now he camps here forever.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nTHE ARROW\n\n\nSlowly, silently, two canoes glided along the still, dark water of a\ngloomy creek over-arched by the interlaced limbs of lofty trees.\n\nThe first, propelled by the slow-dipping blades of two Brazilian\nbushmen, seemed to be seeking something; for it nosed along with\nfrequent pauses of the paddles, during which it drifted almost to a stop\nwhile its crew searched the solemn jungle depths reaching away from the\nright-hand shore. The second, carrying three bronzed and bearded men of\nanother continent, was only trailing the leader. It moved and paused\nlike the first, but the recurrent scrutiny of the farther gloom by its\npaddlers was that of men who saw only a meaningless, monotonous bulk of\nbuttresses and trunks and tangle of looping lianas. In this dimness and\nbewildering chaos the trio might as well have been blind. The eyes of\nthe tiny fleet were in the first boat.\n\nThe progress of the dugouts was almost stealthy. Not a paddle thumped or\nsplashed, not a voice spoke. They moved with the alert caution born not\nof fear, but of wary readiness for any sudden event--like prowling\njungle creatures which, themselves seeking quarry, must be ever on guard\nlest they become the hunted instead of the hunters.\n\nFor the past two days they had moved thus. The last fresh meat had been\nshot miles down the river, where a well-placed bullet from the rifle of\nMcKay had downed a fat swamp deer. Since that day not a gun had been\nfired. The rations now were tough jerked beef and monkey meat, slabs of\nsalt pirarucu fish, and farinha, varied by tinned delicacies from the\nstores of the Americans. Henceforth gunfire was taboo unless it should\nbecome necessary in self-defense.\n\nAt length the fore canoe halted with an abruptness that told of back\nstrokes of the blades hidden under water. McKay, bowman of the trailing\ncraft, also backed water, while his mates held their paddles rigid. The\ntwo boats drifted together.\n\n\"This is the place,\" Louren\u00e7o said, speaking low.\n\nThe Americans, scanning the shore, saw nothing to differentiate the spot\nfrom the rest of the wilderness growth. Yet Louren\u00e7o's tone was sure.\nPedro's face also showed recognition of his surroundings. With no\napparent motion of the paddles--though the wrists of the paddlers moved\nalmost imperceptibly--the canoe of the bushmen floated to the bank. They\npicked up their rifles, twitched their bow up on land, and turned their\nfaces to the forest.\n\n\"Stay here,\" was Pedro's subdued command, \"until you hear the bird-call\nwhich we taught you down the river.\"\n\nHe and Louren\u00e7o faded into the dimness and were gone.\n\n\"Beats me how them guys find their way 'round,\" muttered Tim. \"I could\nland here twenty times hand-runnin', but if I went away and then come\nback I'd never know the place.\"\n\n\"It's all in the feel of it,\" was McKay's low-toned explanation. \"They\nfind places and travel the bush as an Indian does--by a sixth sense.\nTake them to New York City, guide them around, then turn them loose--and\nthey'd be hopelessly lost in ten minutes.\"\n\nThe others nodded agreement and sat watching. In the shadows no creature\nmoved. Afar off some bird cried mournfully like a lost soul condemned to\nwander forever alone in the grim green solitudes. No other sound came to\nthe listeners save the ever-present hum of the big forest mosquitoes, to\nwhich they now had become indifferent. For all they could see or hear of\ntheir two guides, they might as well have been alone. Yet they knew the\nBrazilians were not far away, threading the maze with sure step and\nscouting hawk-eyed for any sign of danger.\n\nAt length a long soft whistle sounded in the bush ahead. Any Indian\nhunter hearing that sound would straightway have begun scanning the high\nbranches, for the liquid call was that of the mutum, or curassow turkey.\nBut the waiting trio knew it for Pedro's signal that all was clear. At\nonce they slid their canoe to shore, lifted its bow to a firm grip on\nthe clay, and, after plumbing the shadows, quietly advanced in squad\ncolumn.\n\nA few steps, and they halted suddenly and whirled. A voice had spoken\njust behind them. There, squatting leisurely between the root buttresses\nof a huge tree, Louren\u00e7o looked up at them in amusement. They had passed\nwithin rifle length of him without seeing him.\n\n\"Of what use are your eyes, comrades?\" he chaffed. \"In the bush one\nshould see in all directions at once. You were looking at that patch of\nsunlight just ahead, yes? But danger lurks in the shadows, not in the\nglaring light.\"\n\nWithout awaiting an answer, he arose and took the lead. At the edge of\nthe small sunlit space beyond he halted.\n\n\"You were heading for the right place,\" he added then. \"Look around. Do\nyou see anything?\"\n\nSwiftly they scrutinized the gap left by the fall of a great tree whose\ngigantic trunk had bludgeoned weaker trees away in its crushing descent.\nSeeing nothing unusual, they then peered around them. Tim suddenly\nsnapped up his rifle.\n\n\"Holler tree there--and a man in it! Hey! come out o' there!\"\n\n\"Your eyes improve,\" Louren\u00e7o complimented. \"But the man is Pedro.\"\n\nTim lowered the gun as Pedro, grinning, came out of his concealment.\n\n\"That is the tree of the Raposa,\" Louren\u00e7o went on. \"The lightning\nflashing in from above showed us the man. But now, senhores, I think we\nmust tramp the bush for some time before we find that Raposa again.\nThere is no trace of him here.\"\n\n\"Hm!\" said Knowlton. Striding to the hollow tree, he peered about inside\nit. The cavity was almost big enough to sling a hammock in, but it was\nempty of any indication of habitation, human or otherwise. A temporary\nrefuge--that was all.\n\n\"No sign anywhere around here, eh?\" queried McKay.\n\n\"We have found none. We shall look farther, but I have small hope. If\nyou senhores will make the camp this time we shall start at once and\nstay out until dark. Build no fire until we return. And if you hear the\ncall of the mutum, pay no attention to it; we may use it to locate each\nother if we separate, and also perhaps as a decoy. Any wild man, red or\nwhite, hearing that call would seek the bird making it, for a fine fat\nmutum is well worth killing. Keep quiet and be on guard.\"\n\n\"Right. Go ahead.\"\n\nThe bushmen turned at once and stole away. The others returned to the\ncanoes, transported the necessary duffle to the base of the hollow tree,\nmade camp with a few poles, and squatted against the trunk to smoke,\nwatch, and wait. Several times they heard mutum calls receding in the\ndistance. Then came silence.\n\nThe sun-thrown shadows in the gap crawled steadily eastward. Knowlton\ntested the feed of his automatic, which, since its balkiness in the\nfight with the Peruvians, he had kept carefully oiled and free from the\nslightest speck of rust. Tim arose at intervals and paced up and down in\nsentry go, eyes and ears alert--a useless activity, but one which\nprovided an outlet for his restless energy. McKay let his gaze rove over\nthe small area visible from their post, studying the contours of the\ntowering trunks, the prone giant whose fall had opened the hole in the\nleafy roof, the parasitical vines twined about other trees, the thin,\noutflung buttresses supporting the mighty columns--all familiar sights\nto him, but the only things to occupy his vision. So limned on his brain\ndid the scene become that after a time he could close his eyes and see\nit in every important detail.\n\nIt might have been two hours after Pedro and Louren\u00e7o had departed--the\nshadows had grown much longer--when over McKay stole the feeling that he\nwas being watched. He glanced at his companions and found that neither\nof them was looking at him. Knowlton, sitting with hands clasped around\nupdrawn knees, was dozing. Tim, though wide awake, was staring absently\nat a fungus. The captain's eyes searched the short vistas all about,\nspying nothing new. Still the feeling persisted. Then all at once his\nroaming gaze stopped, became fixed on a point some forty feet away.\n\nThere rose a rough-barked red-brown tree, and from it, near the ground,\nprojected a blackish bole. McKay was very sure the protuberance had not\nbeen there before. He had stared steadily at that tree more than once,\nand its shape was quite clear in his mind. Was that bump an insensate\nwood growth now revealed for the first time by the changing sun slant,\nor--\n\nFor minutes he watched it. It did not move. Then Tim, restless again,\nrose directly in McKay's line of sight, yawned silently, swung his gun\nto his shoulder, and began another slow parade of his self-appointed\npost. When he had stepped aside McKay looked again for the puzzling\nbole.\n\nIt was gone.\n\nWith a bound the captain was up and dashing toward the tree, drawing his\npistol as he ran. But within three strides he went down. A tough vine,\nunnoticed on the ground, looped snakily around one ankle and threw him\nhard. His gun flew from his hand. As he fell a tiny whispering sound\nflitted past, followed by a small blow somewhere behind him. Ensued a\ngruff grunt from Tim and the swift clatter of a breech bolt.\n\nRaging, McKay kicked his foot loose and heaved himself up. Empty handed,\nhe continued his rush for the tree. But when he reached it he found\nnothing behind it. If anything had been there it now was gone, and the\nvacant shadows beyond were as inscrutable as ever.\n\nFeet padded behind him and Tim and Knowlton halted on either side. A\nmoment of silent searching, and Tim broke into reproach.\n\n\"Cap, don't never do that again! If ye take a tumble in my line o' fire,\nfor the love o' Mike stay down till I shoot! I come so near drillin' ye\nwhen ye hopped up that I'm sweatin' blood right now.\"\n\nIn truth, the veteran was pale around the mouth and his broad face was\nbeaded with cold drops.\n\n\"I seen more 'n one time in France when I felt like shootin' my s'perior\nofficer, but I never come so near doin' it as jest now. I had finger to\ntrigger and had took up the slack, and a hair's weight more pull would\nhave spattered yer head all around. And besides givin' me heart failure\nye let that guy git away. We'll never find him--\"\n\n\"You saw him?\" McKay cut in.\n\n\"I seen somethin' beyond ye--couldn't make out what 'twas, but from the\nway ye was goin' over the top I knowed it must be a man. And then when\nthe arrer come--\"\n\n\"Arrow?\"\n\n\"Sure. Missed ye when ye took that flop, and stuck in the tree over\nyonder. What'd ye rush the guy for, anyways? Whyn't ye drill him from\nwhere ye was?\"\n\nIn the reaction from his sudden fright Tim was as wrathfully ready to\n\"bawl out\" his captain as if he were some raw rookie. McKay, with a cool\nsmile, explained his abrupt action, meanwhile reconnoitering the dimness\nfor any further sign of the vanished assailant. None showed.\n\nWhile Tim stood vigilant guard the other two stooped and moved around\nthe base of the tree, narrowly examining the ground. Beyond it they\npaused at one spot, fingered the soil lightly, and lit a match or two.\n\n\"No ghost,\" said Knowlton. \"Barefoot man. Didn't leave much trace, but\nenough to show he was here. Let's look at that arrow.\"\n\nBack to the hollow tree they went, retrieving McKay's pistol on the way.\nAbout a yard above the earth a long shaft projected from the bark.\nKnowlton reached for it, but McKay held him back and drew it out.\n\n\"M-hm! Thought so!\" he muttered. \"Poisoned.\"\n\n\"Oof! Nice, gentle sort of a cuss,\" rumbled Tim. \"That smear on the\npoint--is that poison?\"\n\n\"Poison. Quickest and deadliest kind of poison. Mixes instantly with\nblood. Paralysis--convulsions--death. The least scratch and you're gone.\nWicked head on this thing, too: looks like a piece of serrated bone. See\nall those little barbs along the edges? War arrow, all right.\"\n\n\"Meanin' that we'll be jumped pretty soon by more Injuns. If that guy's\non the warpath he ain't alone.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't be a bad idea to take cover,\" nodded McKay. Turning the\nfive-foot shaft downward, he plunged its head into the soft ground and\nleft it sticking there, harmless.\n\n\"Tim, go down and guard the canoes. Merry, lie in between these roots\nand keep watch off that way. I'll go over to that tree where the spy\nhid.\"\n\nFor another hour the camp was silent. Each in his covert, finger on\ntrigger, the trio watched with ceaseless vigilance, expecting each\ninstant to detect dusky forms crawling up from tree to tree. Yet nothing\nof the sort came. Nor did any hostile sound reach them. Somewhere\nparrots squawked, somewhere else the puppylike yapping of toucans\ndisturbed the solitude; nothing else.\n\nThe wan light faded. The sun crawled up the trees, leaving all the\nground in shadow. Then, not far off, sounded the soft whistle of the\nmutum. Suspicious, the watchers held their places until, with another\nwhistle, Pedro came into view, followed by Louren\u00e7o.\n\nMcKay arose, met them, and briefly explained the situation. They nodded,\nbut seemed undisturbed.\n\n\"We can start a fire now, Capitao,\" Louren\u00e7o said. \"Night comes and we\nare hungry. There will be no danger before another dawn.\"\n\nWith which he leaned his rifle against a tree and started immediate\npreparations for a meal. Pedro continued on to the canoes, made sure\nthey were drawn up high enough to remain in place in case of any sudden\nrain, and returned with Tim. Around them now resounded the swiftly\nrising roar of the nightly outbreak of animal life. The sun vanished. At\nonce blackness whelmed all except the little fire.\n\n\"See anything while you were out?\" asked McKay.\n\n\"We found no trace of the Raposa,\" Louren\u00e7o evaded.\n\n\"What do you plan to do now?\"\n\n\"Eat--smoke--talk--sleep.\"\n\nMcKay eyed the bushman keenly, feeling that he was holding something\nback. But, feeling also that this pair knew what they were about, he\nbided his time. When all had eaten and tobacco smoke was blending with\nthat of the burning wood, Louren\u00e7o drew the arrow from the ground and\nstudied it. Then he passed it to Pedro, who, after a critical\nexamination, held it in the blaze until the deadly head was burned away.\n\n\"A big-game arrow of the cannibal Mayorunas,\" said Louren\u00e7o. \"The point,\nwith its sawtooth barbs, is made from the tail bone of the araya, the\nflat devilfish of the swamp lakes. That fish, as you perhaps know, has a\nwhiplike tail armed with that bone; and if he strikes the bone into your\nflesh it breaks off and stays in the wound, and you are likely to die.\"\n\n\"But in that case death comes from gangrene,\" McKay remarked. \"This\npoint has been dipped in wurali poison.\"\n\n\"You have seen such arrows before, Capitao?\"\n\n\"Seen the poison before, yes. Over in British Guiana. The Macusi Indians\nmake it from the wurali vine, some bitter root or other, a couple of\nbulbous plants, two kinds of ants--one big and black with a venomous\nbite, the other small and red--a lot of pepper, and the pounded fangs of\nlabarri and couanacouchi snakes. They boil all this stuff down to a\nthick syrup, and that's the poison. The man who makes it is sick for\ndays afterward.\"\n\n\"Our cannibals make that poison in much the same way. Yet Guiana is many\nhundreds of miles from here, and our Indians know nothing of those\nMacusi people. Queer, is it not, that the same plan should be used by\nsavages thousands of miles apart?\"\n\n\"Rather odd. Must have started from some common source hundreds of years\nago and spread around. Queerest thing is, though, that a poison so\ndeadly doesn't spoil meat for eating.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" exclaimed Tim. \"Mean to say them cannibals can kill us by\nscratchin' us with a poison arrer and then stummick us afterwards?\"\n\n\"Exactly. You'd taste just as sweet as ever, Tim--maybe more so. Cheer\nup! They say it doesn't hurt much to die that way; you're paralyzed so\nquick you just sort of fade out.\"\n\nTim shook his head, his abhorrence of poison strong as ever. Knowlton\nspoke.\n\n\"I've heard that this wurali poison is much overrated, that it will kill\nonly birds and monkeys, not men.\"\n\n\"_Por Deus!_ Whoever said that was a fool trying to appear wise!\" Pedro\nsnorted. \"We have seen the poison death, and we know.\"\n\nMcKay also shook his head.\n\n\"Experiments have been made with the wurali of the Macusis,\" he stated.\n\"It was tried on a hog, a sloth--and a sloth is mighty hard to\nkill--also on mules, and on a full-grown ox weighing almost half a ton.\nIt killed every one of them.\"\n\nA momentary silence followed. Tim gazed sourly at the arrow, now\nharmless but still sinister.\n\n\"Urrrgh!\" he growled. \"Cap, ye had a narrer squeak--come near gittin' it\nfrom in front, and behind, too. Wisht I could have drilled that guy.\"\n\nThe bushmen grinned. And Louren\u00e7o's next speech was amazing.\n\n\"Be thankful you did not. That bullet might have killed us all.\"\n\nAfter enjoying their puzzled expressions a moment he continued.\n\n\"We are nearer to a Mayoruna _maloca_ than I thought. Not the one I\nintended to seek, but a smaller one. It is about three days' journey\nfrom here, and to reach it we must go through the bush. The man who left\nthis arrow here to-day is from that _maloca_.\n\n\"A week ago his brother went hunting, and he has not returned. So this\nyoung savage and three of his comrades now are searching the bush for\nsome sign of him. To-day they separated, each going in a different\ndirection, agreeing to meet again to-night at a place less than half a\nday's journey from here. This man circled around and worked along this\ncreek, knowing his brother would hardly go beyond the water. He spied\nour canoes, then sought the men who had come in them and found you.\n\n\"He watched you for some time, and if you had not rushed at him he would\nhave slipped away without attacking you, for he was alone and he saw\nyour guns. But when you, Capitao, suddenly leaped at him he darted away,\nthen stopped long enough to send an arrow at you. After that he dodged\nout of sight and ran to the camp of his three friends. He is there now,\ntelling about you.\"\n\n\"Great guns! You chaps are wizards!\" cried Knowlton. \"How do you know\nall this?\"\n\n\"Because we met him while on our way back here. He was running hard, and\nwe heard him, so we blocked him. After we convinced him that we were\nfriendly we talked for some time--I can speak their tongue--and he told\nus about you. He was sure you were enemies to him and his people, and\nbelieved also you had killed his missing brother, and he was going first\nto rejoin his companions and then hasten to the _maloca_ to bring all\ntheir fighters against you. It was well that we met him in time. It was\nwell, too, that you did not shoot him--or even shoot at him. His\ncompanions would have learned of it, and then--death for us all.\"\n\n\"And now what?\"\n\n\"Now, comrades, we all go to the _maloca_ of that man. We meet him and\nthe other three to-morrow at the place where we talked to him to-day. I\ntold him we were going to visit that other chief whom I knew, and,\nthough he was at first suspicious of a trap, he finally agreed to lead\nus to his own chief. So in the morning we march. Now let us sleep.\"\n\nKnowlton and McKay glanced at each other and nodded.\n\n\"Luck's with us so far,\" said the captain.\n\n\"Right. We just march right into Jungle Town with bodyguard and\neverything. Pretty soft! Wonder if they'll turn out the tomtom band to\ndrum us in.\"\n\nTim said nothing. He squinted again at the headless arrow, then\ninspected the breech bolt of his rifle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nTHE WAY OF THE JUNGLE\n\n\nDawn came, dismal, damp, and chill. Moisture dripped drearily from the\nupper reaches, and under the dense canopy of leaves and limbs the gloom\nand the fog together made a murk wherein the early-rising bushmen were\nscarcely visible to the North Americans ten feet away. Yet day had come,\nor was coming; the noise of the animal world left little doubt of that.\n\nBy the light of a sullen smoky fire and oil-smeared torches Pedro and\nLouren\u00e7o made up their packs, cording them roughly with bark-cloth\nstrips brought from headquarters. The Americans, after eating a more\nsolid meal than the Brazilians seemed to require, also rolled their\nblankets, hammocks, nets, and other paraphernalia; strapped the outfits\ninto the army pack harnesses which they had transported for thousands of\nmiles and never yet used; crammed their web belts with cartridges; slung\ntheir sheathed machetes down their left thighs; looked to their guns;\nand announced themselves ready to go.\n\nWhile the northerners made these final preparations their guides slipped\naway for a time. Pedro, on his return, announced that the canoes had\nbeen concealed. Louren\u00e7o, bringing back the freshly filled canteens of\nthe ex-army men, delivered with them the marching orders of the day.\n\n\"If you thirst, comrades, drink only from your canteens. If the canteens\nfail, never fill them from flowing water unless the Indians also drink\nfrom the stream. There are always small pools to be found, and, though\ntheir water may be warm and stale, it is not likely to be poisoned, as\nthe streams may be.\n\n\"To-day, and every day after we meet the cannibals, make no suspicious\nmoves. Do not speak harshly. Do not laugh or sneer at them. They are\nunreasoning and easily insulted, and lifelong foes when angered. Let me\ndo the talking.\n\n\"Do not hold a gun in a threatening manner or draw pistols unless you\nmust fight. Then kill.\n\n\"Above all, pay no attention to their women.\n\n\"Now we go. I lead.\"\n\nHe turned and strode away into the fog as easily and surely as if\ncat-eyed and cat-footed. Pedro swung nonchalantly after him. The others\nfollowed in order, hitching at their backstraps.\n\nThe ghostly haze about them now was paler, but through the interstices\noverhead came no glint of sunshine, nor even the glow of a clear dawn.\nThe whole sky evidently was overcast, and around the marching men the\ngloom still lay thick. Yet Louren\u00e7o's eyes seemed to bore through the\nshades and the dark shroud blurring the trunks, for his steady gait did\nnot falter. The little file hung close together, for all knew that any\nman straggling would be instantly lost.\n\nWorming around gigantic columns, crawling over rotting trunks long laid\nlow, changing direction abruptly when blocked by some great butt too\nhigh to be scaled, sinking ankle-deep in clinging mud, the venturesome\nband wound along through the wilderness. Repeated glances at his compass\nshowed McKay that the general trend of the march was southeast; but the\nimpassable obstacles encountered at frequent intervals necessitated not\nonly detours, but sometimes actual back-tracking.\n\n\"Walk four miles to advance one,\" was his thought. And for some time it\nseemed that such was the case. But then the ground changed, the light\nimproved, the trees thinned, and the undergrowth became more dense--and,\nparadoxically, the rate of progress improved.\n\nThis was because the smaller growth gave the two leaders a chance to cut\ntheir way straight onward instead of dodging about; and cut they did.\nTheir machetes swung with untiring energy, opening a path through what\nseemed an impenetrable tangle. Now every yard of movement was a yard\ngained. But the ground was rising and the struggle up some of the sharp\nslopes winded more than one man.\n\nThen the slope dipped the other way, and they slipped down into a ravine\nwhere water gleamed darkly. Here a halt was called while the leaders\nsought for a fallen tree. Tim squatted and mopped his face for the\nhundredth time.\n\n\"Gosh! This is what I call travelin'!\" he panted. \"Flounderin' round in\nmud soup, bit to death by skeeters and them what-ye-call-'em\nflies--piums--sweatin' yerself bone dry and totin' forty thousand\npounds, on yer back, not to mention hardware slung all over ye--this\nain't no place for a minister's son or a fat guy, I'll tell the world.\nAnd this is only the start!\"\n\nA call from Pedro forestalled any answer. The trio struggled along to\nthe spot where the guides waited at the butt of a slanting tree trunk\nspanning the gulf. As they reached it Pedro walked carefully up the\ntrunk, carrying a long slender sapling, which he lowered and fixed in\nthe bottom of the stream. Then, steadying himself with the upper end of\nthis pole, he continued his journey to the other side, where he flipped\nthe sapling back to Louren\u00e7o. One by one the others crossed, slipping,\nalmost losing balance, but managing to evade a fall. Tim, walking the\nprecarious bridge and looking down, saw that the surface of the water\nwas dotted with the heads of venomous snakes.\n\n\"Are you following your trail of yesterday?\" demanded McKay.\n\n\"No, Capitao. Yesterday we circled. To-day we go as nearly straight as\npossible.\"\n\n\"And you can find the appointed place by this new route?\" The captain's\ntone was dubious.\n\n\"Certainly. Else I should go the other way. Come.\"\n\nUp another bank they toiled, and on through rugged country which seemed\nmomentarily to become higher and harder to traverse. In the minds of the\nAmericans grew suspicion that, for the first time, the Brazilians were\nbluffing; it seemed impossible for any man to keep his sense of\ndirection in such a maze. But they said no word and followed on.\n\nAt length the leader paused and sent the long call of the mutum floating\nthrough the trees. No answer came. After a moment the line moved on,\neach man peering ahead with sharper gaze, each holding a little tighter.\nTo the Americans, at least, the thought of possible ambush loomed large.\n\nFour man-eating savages, hidden in this labyrinthine tangle and armed\nwith arrows whose slightest scratch meant death, could strike down every\nman of this expedition without even a wound in return; for of what avail\nwere high-power guns, automatic pistols, and machetes against invisible\nenemies? Yet there was assurance in Louren\u00e7o's confident air, and\nreassurance in the thought that these tribemen would be unlikely to\nassail a band avowedly on its way to visit their chief.\nBesides--Knowlton smiled grimly--even if the Mayorunas hungered for\nhuman flesh it would be more economical of labor to let the meat travel\nto the slaughterhouse on its own legs than to kill it here and carry it\nhome.\n\nAgain the mutum whistle drifted away. Again no answer came. For a short\ndistance farther the file continued its march. Then, in a small opening\nwhere the uptorn roots of a tree rose like a wall at one side, it\nhalted.\n\n\"The place of meeting,\" Pedro said. All peered around. None saw anything\nbut the upstanding roots, the forest jumble, the misty serpentine\nlianas. None heard any sound but their own hoarse breathing, the solemn\ndrip of water, the insect hum, and the occasional melancholy notes of\nbirds. The place seemed bare of life. Yet upon McKay came again that\nfeeling of being watched.\n\nSlowly, deeply, Louren\u00e7o spoke. The words meant nothing to his mates.\nThey were like no words they knew. His eyes roved about as he talked,\nand it was evident that he saw no more than did the silent men behind\nhim. But they guessed that he said he and they were there as agreed,\nwith peace in their hearts, and that he was telling the men of the\nwilderness to come forward without fear. And they guessed rightly.\n\nAs quietly as a phantom of the mist a man took shape at the edge of the\ntree roots. Tall, straight, slender, symmetrically proportioned, with\nunblemished skin of light-bronze hue, straight black hair, and deep dark\neyes, he was a splendid type of savage. Face and body were adorned with\nglossy paint--scarlet and black rings around the eyes, two red stripes\nfrom temple to chin, wavy lines on arms and chest. He held a bow longer\nthan himself, with a five-foot arrow fitted loosely to the string and\npointed downward, but ready for instant use. Diagonally across his body\nran a cord supporting a quiver, from which the feathered shafts of\nseveral arrows projected above his left shoulder. Around his waist\nlooped another cord from which dangled a small loin mat. Otherwise he\nwas totally nude--a bronze statue of freedom.\n\nLouren\u00e7o spoke again in the same quiet tone. The savage stepped warily\nforward. At the same moment three other naked men appeared with equal\nstealth from tree trunks which had seemed barren of all life. Like the\nfirst, each of these held an arrow ready, but pointing downward; and\neach moved with the slow, velvety step of a hunting jaguar. Their eyes\nsearched those of these strange men of another world who, wearing\nuseless clothing, carrying heavy weapons of steel, burdening themselves\nwith queer weights on their backs, now invaded the wilderness which they\nand their fathers had roamed untrammeled for centuries. The invaders in\nturn studied the faces of the Mayorunas, of whom so many gruesome tales\nwere told. For long silent minutes primitive and civilized man probed\neach other for signs of treachery--and found none.\n\nTim, forgetting the orders of the day, spoke out abruptly. At the gruff\njar of his voice the wild men started and raised their weapons.\n\n\"Say, are those guys cannibals? I was lookin' to see some ugly mutts\nwith underslung jaws and mops o' frizzy hair, like them Feejee Islanders\nye see pitchers of. Barrin' the paint, I've seen worse-lookin' fellers\nthan these back home.\"\n\nWith which he gave the savages a wide, unmistakably approving grin.\n\n\"Shut up!\" muttered McKay.\n\nLouren\u00e7o, unruffled, made instant capital of Tim's remarks.\n\n\"My comrade of the red hair,\" he said in the Indian tongue, \"has never\nbefore seen the mighty warriors of the Mayorunas, and is astonished to\nfind them such handsome men. He says his own countrymen are not so good\nto look upon.\"\n\nSlowly the menacing arrows sank. As the savages studied Tim's wholesome\ngrin and absorbed the broad flattery of Louren\u00e7o a slight smile passed\nover their faces. They stood more at ease. The whites sensed at once\nthat, for a moment, at least, a friendly footing had been established,\nand relaxed from their own tension.\n\nOnce more Louren\u00e7o spoke, motioning toward the farther distances. The\nIndian who had first appeared now replied briefly. Two of the others\nstepped back to their trees and lifted long, hollow tubes.\n\n\"What's them?\" demanded Tim.\n\n\"Blowguns,\" Pedro answered. \"They use them for small or thin-skinned\ngame. See, the two blowgun men carry also short darts in their quivers,\nand small pouches of poison.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. They like their poison a dang sight better 'n I do. Say, are\nthem guys goin' to march behind us? I don't want no poison needles\nslipped into my back, accidental or other ways.\"\n\nTwo of the savages were walking toward the rear of the line. Knowlton,\nexasperated, snapped out:\n\n\"They'll walk where they like, and you'll do well to give us more\nmarching and less mouth. You nearly spilled the beans just now, and if\nLouren\u00e7o hadn't said something that pleased these fellows we all might\nbe in the soup this minute. Pipe down!\"\n\n\"Aw, Looey, I only said these guys were good-lookin'. Ain't no fight in\nwords like that.\"\n\n\"You heard the orders this morning. Let Louren\u00e7o do the talking. That\ngoes! We're skating on thin ice--so thin that if it breaks we drop plump\ninto hell. Less noise!\"\n\n\"Right, sir,\" was the sulky answer. \"I'm deaf and dumb.\"\n\n\"March,\" added McKay. The head of the column already was on the move,\nled by the tallest Indian and a blowgun man, behind whom walked the two\nBrazilians. The whole line took up the step in turn and passed on into\nthe unknown.\n\nAgain McKay consulted his compass at intervals, finding that now the\nroute led more to the south, though there still was an easterly trend.\nAfter a time, however, the telltale needle informed him that they were\nproceeding almost due east, and glances at the surroundings showed that\non their right was a densely matted mass of undergrowth. Not long\nafterward another interwoven brush wall blocked the way, and this time\nthe leader veered to the west. Not until an opening appeared did he\nresume his southward course. It dawned on McKay that the savages, having\nno bush knives, were accustomed to follow the line of least resistance.\nThis obviously increased the distance traveled.\n\nThe men of Coronel Nunes, too, perceived this. A halt was called, during\nwhich Louren\u00e7o talked with the guide, tapped his machete, and evidently\nprotested against needless detours. The leader, with a few words,\npointed south. Louren\u00e7o nodded and replied. The march was resumed, and\nwhen the next impenetrable tangle was encountered the Indians in the van\nstepped aside, the machetes of the Brazilians flashed out, and a way was\ncut straight through. From that time on the long knives came into\nfrequent play and a direct course was maintained.\n\nSuddenly, with a grunt of warning, the tall tribesman stopped. The plan\nof chopping through instead of going around had brought the Indians into\na part of the forest which they had not heretofore traversed in their\nsearch for the missing hunter. Now they stood in a small trough between\nthe knolls, under good-sized trees around which grew little brush. The\nground was soft, almost watery. In the damp air, faint but unmistakable,\nhung the odor of death.\n\nThe savages at the rear came forward at once. All four of them spread\nout and, sniffing the air, advanced up the trough. A cry broke from one\nof them. The others, and the white men, too, hastened to the spot whence\nthe call had come.\n\nScattered about in the soft muck were bones, two skulls, bits of tawny\nfur, a long bow, several big-game arrows. Around them the ground was\nmarked with many tracks. Most of the imprints were of the vultures which\nhad stripped the bones, but there were others--those of a barefoot man,\nof a great cat, and of a couple of wild hogs. The peccary tracks went\nstraight on, but those of the man and the cat showed that a fierce\nstruggle had occurred. And one of the two grinning skulls was that of a\njaguar.\n\nThe story was plain. The hunter, following fast on the trail of the\nhogs, had suddenly met the jaguar. He had shot it; one arrow, blood\nstained for more than a foot above the barb, proved that. But in the few\nseconds of life left to it the animal had sprung and fatally torn the\nman. Then, as usual, had dropped the black scavengers of the sky to rend\nthem both.\n\nSilently the men of the bush and the men of the north looked down at the\nbrief history written in the mud--a story only a week old, yet ancient\nas human life itself--primitive man and ferocious brute destroying each\nother as in the prehistoric days when saber-toothed tiger and troglodyte\nhunted and slew for the right to live. And as it had been then, so it\nwas now. The living read the tale of tragedy and passed on, leaving the\nbones behind them. Only, before they went, the Mayorunas threw the\nremnants of the jaguar aside and piled the bones of their dead comrade\ntogether in one place. Then, bearing with them his bow and arrows, they\nresumed their way without a word.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nA DUEL WITH DEATH\n\n\nRain came and went.\n\nThe first night's camp of the strangely assorted company was a wet one,\nfor well on in the day the skies poured down the watery weight which had\nbeen troubling them once morning. Yet even in such miserable weather the\nfour tribesmen of the Mayorunas declined to sleep in the same camp with\nthe whites. They accepted the food tendered them, but when it was eaten\nthey withdrew to some covert of their own to spend the night. Whereby\nthe whites knew that, though their guides now could no longer suspect\nthem of killing the lone hunter, they still were not accepted as\nfriends.\n\n\"Did ye say them guys had a trick of jabbin' men in their hammicks at\nnight, Renzo?\" was Tim's significant question after the Indians had\ndeparted.\n\n\"Have no fear,\" Louren\u00e7o assured him. \"They have promised to take us\nsafely to their chief.\"\n\n\"How much is the word of a cannibal worth?\" asked Knowlton.\n\n\"Worth everything, so long as you do nothing to make them forget it,\nsenhor. Being uncivilized, they are not liars.\"\n\nThe lieutenant eyed him sharply, half minded to regard the answer as\ninsolent. But there was no insolence in the Brazilian's straightforward\ngaze, and McKay laughed approvingly.\n\n\"Well spoken!\" was the captain's comment.\n\n\"Among those people there are but two great crimes,\" Louren\u00e7o added.\n\"They are, to speak falsely or to be a coward.\"\n\n\"Wherein a goodly portion of the so-called civilized world would fail to\nmeasure up to the standards of these cannibals,\" McKay said. \"By the\nway, have you asked them about the Raposa?\"\n\n\"No, Capitao. It is as well not to put into their heads the idea that we\nare hunting anyone here. I shall say nothing of that matter until we\nreach the chief who knows me.\"\n\n\"Good idea.\"\n\nWith that the talk ended and all sought their hammocks, dog tired from\nthe day's travel. No watch was kept, for, as Pedro quaintly phrased it,\n\"We now are in the hands of God and the cannibals.\" Nor was any watch\nneeded.\n\nDaybreak brought sunlight. While the breakfast coffee was being boiled\nthe four wild men appeared silently and simultaneously, one bringing a\nred howling monkey and another a large green parrot as their\ncontributions to the morning meal. Neither bird nor animal showed any\nwound except a slightly discolored spot surrounding a skin puncture no\nlarger than if made by a woman's hatpin--the marks left by poisoned\ndarts from the ten-foot blowguns. When the meat was cooked they offered\nportions to the whites, of whom Tim alone refused.\n\n\"I'd as quick eat a rat killed with Paris green,\" he growled. \"No\npoisoned meat gits into my stummick if I know it.\"\n\n\"Bosh!\" scoffed McKay. \"It's perfectly wholesome--though it's tough as a\nrubber boot.\"\n\n\"And I might tell you, senhores, that among these people it is an insult\nto refuse any food offered you,\" added Louren\u00e7o. \"I advise you to forget\nabout the poison hereafter and eat what is put before you, even if it\nstinks.\"\n\nHis advice was emphasized by the evident displeasure of the tribesmen,\nwho, though saying nothing, looked rather grimly at the man who had\ndespised their provisions. But Louren\u00e7o then smoothed over the matter by\ntelling them that the red-haired man was sick at the stomach that\nmorning--which, at that particular moment, was not far from the truth.\n\nSoon the triglot column was once more on its way across the hill\ncountry, which hourly grew higher and rougher--a constant succession of\nridges and ravines. Louren\u00e7o, pointing out the absence of water marks on\nthe trees of the uplands, said that now the land of the great annual\nfloods had been left behind; for even the sixty-foot rise of waters in\nthe rainy season could not reach to these hilltops. With the entry into\nthis terra firma the travelers had also found the sun again, the dank\nmist of yesterday having vanished. Nevertheless, the going was fully as\nhard as on the previous day, because of the density of the bush and of\nthe labor of crossing the narrow but deep streams flowing at the bottom\nof nearly every clove. Few words were exchanged, every man needing his\nbreath for the work of walking.\n\nAs before, the keen machetes of the Brazilians opened a direct route\nthrough all opposing undergrowth. When a brief halt was called at noon\nthe Mayorunas, who seemed to know exactly where they were despite the\nfact that they had never before followed this straight course, informed\nLouren\u00e7o that much circuitous traveling had already been saved, and that\nby tramping hard until sundown they might succeed in reaching the tribal\n_maloca_ that night. But McKay vetoed the idea of a forced march.\n\n\"This gait is fast enough and hard enough,\" he declared. \"No sense in\nexhausting ourselves to save a few hours' time. Also, we don't want to\ngo staggering into the Mayoruna village with our tongues hanging out and\nour knees wabbling. First impressions are lasting with such people, and\nthey might get an idea we were weaklings.\"\n\nTo which all except the savages, who did not understand the language of\nthe white man, assented approvingly.\n\nYet it was the Mayorunas themselves who delayed arrival at their\n_maloca_--the Mayorunas and a monkey. When the sinking sun was still two\nhours high, and while the leader was forcing the pace as if determined\nto reach home that night whether the rest liked it or not, the monkey\nupset any such plan.\n\nHe was a big gray monkey, and he was high up in the branches of a tall\nmatamata tree, where he deemed himself safe from the many creatures\nlaboring along the ground below. Wherefore he chattered impudently down\nat them and, as the tall Indian guide halted, showed his teeth\nderisively. The savage grunted. The man behind him also grunted and\nlifted his blowgun. But the leader growled at him and the blowgun sank.\n\nWith a swift sweep of the hand the guide drew from his quiver one of\nthose long, poisoned arrows and fitted it to the bow cord, which he had\nlaid on the ground. With two toes of each foot he held the cord firmly\non the soil. His right hand lightly grasped the arrow and aimed it up at\nthe insolent primate. His left drew the bow up, up, into an arc.\n\n_Twang!_ the cord thrummed as his lifted toes released it. The arrow\nwhirred aloft. Then a snarl of chagrin from the marksman blended with\nthe grunts of his mates. The arrow had failed to reach the quarry.\n\nIt had missed, however, by a mere hand's breadth--missed only because it\nstruck the limb directly under the monkey, where it hung by the tip from\nthe bark. Muttering something which may have been a Mayoruna\nmalediction, the savage moved aside a step or two, drew another arrow,\nand set it to the cord with more care than before. But while he did this\nthe monkey was not idle.\n\nChattering in rage, the animal leaned down, worked the arrow loose from\nthe bark, and threw it aside. The deadly shaft turned in air, then\nplunged aimlessly earthward. At that instant all below were watching the\nguide, who in turn was looking at his toes and placing the new arrow in\nposition. Unseen, the other missile hurtled down--and ripped across the\nback of the marksman's left hand.\n\nFor an instant the tall cannibal stood as if petrified, staring at his\ncut hand and the shaft now sticking upright in the ground beside him.\nThen, in simple symbolism, he reversed the new arrow and stabbed it also\ninto the dirt. Dropping his bow, he lay down on his back.\n\n\"Yuara will draw bow no more. Yuara goes to join the spirits of the\ndead,\" he said, calmly.\n\nMechanically Louren\u00e7o translated the words. McKay sprang forward.\n\n\"No!\" he disputed. \"Not without a try for life, anyhow! Merry, sling a\ntourniquet! Quick!\"\n\nKnowlton jumped to the side of Yuara, tied a handkerchief above the\nelbow, twisted it tight. McKay whipped from a pocket a keen-bladed\nknife. In one swift ruthless slash he laid open the arm from elbow to\nknuckles.\n\n\"Keep that tourniquet tight!\" he snapped. \"If the blood once gets past\nit he's gone. Tim, get out the salt bag! Louren\u00e7o, tell this fellow to\nbreathe deep and keep it up!\"\n\nWhile Tim burrowed into his pack for the salt, Louren\u00e7o spoke, as much\nfor the benefit of the other tribesmen as for that of Yuara; for the\nthree Mayorunas stood in ominous silence, watching the outrush of blood\ncaused by the knife of the white man.\n\n\"The white man of the black beard, who is very wise, will save Yuara to\ndraw many a good bow if Yuara will do as he says. Let Yuara breathe\ndeeply, that the spirit of life remain in him to fight against the demon\nof death. Even now the poison rushes out of the arm of Yuara.\"\n\n\"Yuara cannot live,\" was Yuara's cool reply. \"Where once the poison has\nentered, there follows death.\"\n\n\"Is Yuara then a coward, that he will die without a fight? Then he is no\nMayoruna, for no Mayoruna is a coward. Let Yuara die if he will. His\ncomrades shall carry to their _maloca_ the tale that, although the white\nman would have saved him, he died like an old woman, because he had not\nthe will to live!\"\n\nFire shot into the eyes of the prostrate man. He ground his teeth and\nstruggled to rise and throttle the insulting Brazilian.\n\n\"No, not that way,\" Louren\u00e7o went on at once. \"Yuara can fight the death\ndemon only by drawing into himself the air in which is the spirit of\nlife. The wise white man has stopped the poison at the place where the\ncloth is tied, and he knows the air spirits will help Yuara if Yuara\nwill breathe deep and long. If he will not, then the white man's\nmedicine cannot save him. Yuara's life or death is in his own hands.\"\n\nIn his heart Louren\u00e7o had faint hope that the injured man would live.\nBut he knew the rest of the cannibal tribe must soon hear the tale of\nthis incident from the three now present, and he was preparing an\nexcellent excuse for the failure of McKay to save him. Whether Yuara\nlived or not, the Mayorunas now would know that the whites had done\ntheir utmost for him, and that very fact might make a vast difference.\n\nYuara, though his eyes still flamed, sank back under McKay's restraining\nweight and obeyed orders. After the first couple of breaths he settled\ninto his task and his chest rose and fell rhythmically.\n\n\"Here's yer salt, Cap. What'll I do with it?\"\n\n\"You come here and hold this tourniquet. Don't let it slip! Merry, fill\nthis chap's mouth with salt. Louren\u00e7o, tell him to hold it as long as\npossible, then swallow it. Now, Merry, fix up a good strong salt\npoultice. The rest of you make camp. We've got a stiff fight on our\nhands, and we can't go farther until we've either won or lost.\"\n\nThe Brazilians glanced at the sun shadows and remained where they were.\nAccording to their experience, Yuara should be dead within ten minutes\nat most. Time enough to make camp when they knew how this venture would\nresult. The Mayorunas also stood fast and watched for the shadow of\ndeath to blanch the face of their stricken mate.\n\nBut the minutes dragged past and Yuara's eyes did not grow dim. His\nfirst resignation over and his fighting blood aroused, he was battling\ngrimly against fate. At times his deep respirations were broken by\nsudden gasps, and spasmodic quivers shook his whole body. But he\nbreathed on, paying no heed to the burning pain of his ripped and salted\narm.\n\n\"By cripes! he's puttin' up a man's scrap!\" blurted Tim. \"Stay with it,\nold feller. Ye'll win out yet!\"\n\nAnd as more minutes passed and the wounded man still breathed, a murmur\nof wonderment passed among the cannibals and the men of Nunes. Yuara\nshould be dead, yet he was not even paralyzed. Such a thing had never\nbefore been known in this bush.\n\nLouren\u00e7o touched Pedro's arm.\n\n\"Find a spot where we can make camp,\" he said. \"I must stay here to\nspeak to the wild men if words are needed.\"\n\nReluctantly Pedro went away. Soon he was back with news of a suitable\nplace. He found all bending closer over Yuara, whose breathing had\nbecome stertorous and whose eyes seemed fixed.\n\n\"Going!\" was the bushman's thought. But the others would not have it so.\n\n\"How 'bout a shot o' booze to jolt his heart, Cap?\" suggested Tim, whose\nwhole soul was in the fight.\n\nMcKay nodded. Knowlton quickly produced brandy and poured a stiff dose\ndown Yuara's throat. It took hold at once, and light came back into the\nIndian's eyes.\n\n\"Got a good chance yet,\" McKay asserted. \"Don't loosen that tourniquet.\nLet the arm mortify, if necessary, but hold that blood away from the\nheart at all costs. I'll chop his arm off at the shoulder before I'll\ngive in.\"\n\nHis hard-set face showed he meant it.\n\nLouren\u00e7o spoke to the Mayorunas, urging that camp be made at once. He\nand Pedro strode away, and all three of the Indians followed.\n\n\"Really think he'll pull through, Rod?\" Knowlton asked, then. \"If he\ndoes you're a miracle worker.\"\n\n\"It's an experiment,\" McKay confessed, watching Yuara with unswerving\nintentness. \"Never saw this done, but it's worth a try--and I honestly\nbelieve it will work. I saved an Indian over in Guiana once by cutting\noff his arm as soon as he was hit, but I want to keep this fellow's arm\nfor him if possible. Feed him some more salt.\"\n\nTime passed unheeded. Sounds of labor not far off told that camp was\nbeing built. Presently the absent five returned, two of the Mayorunas\ncarrying a crude but strong litter constructed from saplings and\ngiant-fern leaves. McKay rose stiffly on cramped legs.\n\n\"All right. You can move him,\" he consented.\n\nCarefully Yuara was lifted to the litter and transported to the new\ncamp. There the Americans found not only the open shed, or _tambo_,\nusually constructed by the Brazilians, but also a somewhat similar\nshelter erected by the Indians. In the latter stood two stout crotched\nstakes, firmly braced--the handiwork of Pedro and Louren\u00e7o. And to\nthese, with tough bush rope, the Indians fastened the litter of Yuara,\nthus forming a rude but effective hammock.\n\nWhile McKay and Knowlton continued their ministrations to the stricken\nman the rest of the camp work was completed, the Mayorunas making\nhanging beds for themselves from withes, leaves, and bush cord, and the\nBrazilians slinging the hammocks of their own party and opening packs.\n\nNight fell and the wounded man lived on. Supper was eaten, pipes smoked,\nthe regular activities of the early hours of darkness gone through--and\nYuara lived on. His deep breathing had become automatic, and his eyes\nstared straight up in concentration on his battle with the death demon.\n\nAt length he was seized with violent nausea which convulsed him for a\ntime. But when the spasms passed he lay back more easily, and a faint\nsmile flitted over his face as he looked at the white men.\n\n\"Been expecting that,\" said McKay. \"Might loosen that ligature now--just\na few seconds.... Tighten it! All right.\" Alter watching the sick man a\nlittle longer he added: \"Now I'm going to eat and smoke. Feel like\ntaking a drink, too, but guess I won't. The Indian will pull through\nnow, I think.\"\n\nWhen he had returned to the Indian hut with pipe aglow, Knowlton asked\nhim, \"Now tell us how you doped out this cure.\"\n\n\"Combination of various things. Salt is a partial antidote to venom in\nthe blood, and I got it into him in three ways--by mouth absorption, by\nthe stomach, and by the salt poultice, which drew out some of the poison\nfrom the forearm and helped neutralize what remained. Ripping his arm of\ncourse let out a lot of bad blood. Ligature above the elbow stopped most\nof the rest--though some sneaked past that point, I'm pretty sure.\n\n\"Big thing, though, was the deep breathing. Remember I told you about\nthe experiments that killed mules and an ox? Another experiment was\nthis--opening the windpipe of a poisoned mule after the heart stopped,\ninserting a pair of bellows, and starting artificial respiration. After\nfour hours of this the mule came to life and stayed alive--though he was\na wreck for a year afterward.\n\n\"I just put all these together, made the Indian do his own\nbreathing--and here he is. I'm going to sit up awhile longer and watch\nhim, but the critical period is over. You chaps can turn in.\"\n\nBut none turned in until midnight, when no doubt remained that\nLouren\u00e7o's prophecy would come true--that Yuara would live to draw bow\nagain. Then, when the slashed arm had been thoroughly cleansed and\nbound, Louren\u00e7o spoke once more to the savages.\n\n\"The medicine of the wise white man and the air spirits have saved Yuara\nfrom the death demon. Yuara has fought as a man of his tribe should\nfight, and so has lived when he would have died. To-morrow Yuara shall\nonce more see his people, the first man of the Mayorunas to come back\nfrom the death of poison. And he and his comrades shall tell of the\nwhite man's wisdom, without which he now would lie cold on the ground.\"\n\n\"So shall it be,\" Yuara himself faintly answered. \"Yuara, son of Rana,\nsecond chief of the men of Suba, will not forget.\"\n\n\"_Por Deus!_\" exclaimed Louren\u00e7o. \"Comrades, this man is no common\nhunter, but son of a subchief. Capitao, you have done good work to-day.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nTHE CANNIBALS\n\n\nThrough the long, dim shadows of early morning the little column passed\non the last leg of its journey to the _maloca_ of Suba, chief of this\noutlying tribe of the Mayorunas. At its head marched Yuara, his left arm\nincased in bandages, his face drawn and pallid, his stride stiff and\nspringless, but still carrying his weapons and stoically setting the\npace as befitted the son of a subchief. He had had no sleep; he had lain\nin the gates of death; his arm ached cruelly; yet a warm glow shone in\nhis hollow eyes as he reflected on the fact that in all the unwritten\nhistory of his people he was the first man to survive the inexorable\npower of the wurali. As long as he lived this fact would lift him above\nthe level of all his fellows. Even the chief could not boast of such a\nsuperhuman feat.\n\nThe undergrowth this morning was not so thick as it had been, and the\nmachetes of Louren\u00e7o and Pedro stayed in their sheaths. The ground, too,\nwas more level and the footing more firm. After some three hours of\nwalking the Americans found that they had come into a faint path.\n\nSomewhat to the bewilderment of the white men, who expected the Indians\nto increase their speed now that the way home lay under their feet, the\nleading pair slowed their gait. Moreover, they scanned the trail with\nintent care and watched the trees along the way. At length, with a\nwarning grunt, Yuara stepped out of the path and began a detour. His\ncomrade and the Brazilians followed. The Americans stopped.\n\n\"What's the idea?\" demanded McKay, looking along the innocent-appearing\npath.\n\n\"Probably a man trap, Capitao,\" answered Pedro. \"Follow us.\"\n\n\"Let's see the trap first.\"\n\nLouren\u00e7o called to Yuara, who stopped and grunted two words.\n\n\"_Si_, it is a trap. A pit, Yuara says.\"\n\nYuara spoke again, and Louren\u00e7o added: \"He says we must not touch it. It\nis there just before you, covered so cunningly that it looks exactly\nlike the rest of the ground. The cover is a framework of sticks balanced\non a pole, and the instant a man steps on it it gives way. He falls into\na nine-foot hole whose sides are dug inward, so that they overhang above\nhim. There the cannibals find him and kill him. I fell into one of those\nholes when I first came into this Mayoruna country, so I know just how\nthey are made.\"\n\n\"So? How did you get out?\"\n\n\"There were two of us, and I stood on the other man's shoulders while he\nlifted me high enough to jump out. Then I tied bush rope to a tree and\nhe climbed up the rope. Come. Yuara waits.\"\n\nAfter a short circuit around the danger point the party returned to the\npath, and as they went on Louren\u00e7o explained further concerning the pit:\n\n\"Every approach to the _malocas_ has this kind of trap hidden in it, and\nothers also. The Indians recognize the places by some secret signal\nknown only to themselves--a certain kind of stick or vine or something\nof the kind, placed where it can be seen by those who understand. The\ntraps are made to stop any enemies who try to sneak up on the _malocas_\nand catch these people unawares. Another kind of trap is a spring bow or\na blowgun shot by a vine stretched across the path. Still another is a\npiece of ground studded with poisoned araya bones which pierce the bare\nfeet of anyone walking on them. It is well for us that we now have\nfriendly guides.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" McKay agreed, dryly.\n\nSome distance farther on the leader again left the path, and this time\nall filed after him without comment. Pedro pointed significantly at a\nthin, tight-drawn bush cord stretched across the path at the height of a\nman's ankle--the trigger which would discharge hidden death at anything\ntouching it. At another point, perhaps a hundred feet farther along, a\nthird and last detour was made, and this time the nature of the trap was\nnot revealed by anything on the ground. No questions were asked.\n\nWith the passing of these three menaces Yuara resumed his former pace\nand abandoned his circumspection. Before long came sounds of communal\nlife--the barking of a dog and shouts of children. Then suddenly the\nforest thinned, and after a few more strides the marchers found\nthemselves in a clearing.\n\nBefore them rose a big round house, about forty feet high and a hundred\nfeet in diameter, its sides composed of palm logs, and its roof a thick\nthatch of palm leaves, whence smoke oozed lazily through an opening at\nthe peak. A single low door, not more than four feet high, opened toward\na creek a few rods away at the right. Near this doorway a couple of\nnaked children, boy and girl, were playing with the dog, while beyond\nthem a number of women, also nude, were busy at some kind of work.\n\nAs Yuara and his fellow-tribesmen entered the open space the boy shouted\na greeting and started running toward them. Then, seeing the white men\nfiling from the bush behind the warriors, the youngster stood as if\nshocked motionless. After one long stare he screamed and bolted for the\nshelter of the _maloca_. Other screams echoed his as the women also saw\nthe bearded outlanders. They, too, dived through the doorway.\n\nOut from behind the house leaped three warriors, two of whom already had\nfitted arrows to their bows, while the third--a powerful\nfellow--clutched a four-foot war club. Weapons raised, faces contracted\ninto fighting masks, they stared speechless at the spectacle of the\nsubchief's son calmly leading gun-bearing whites among them.\n\nKnowlton, though his attention was riveted on the astonished warriors,\ncaught the quiet snick of Tim's safe-lock being turned off.\n\n\"None of that, Tim!\" he warned. \"Put that safety on again. And don't\nhold your gun as if you intended to use it.\"\n\n\"Aw, I was jest tryin' her to make sure she was all right.\"\n\n\"Put it on!\" snapped the lieutenant. Another tiny click told him the\norder was obeyed.\n\nOut from the doorway darted another warrior, stooping low to avoid\nhitting his head. Others followed instantly, all armed and ready for\naction. The opening was still vomiting tribesmen when Yuara and the rest\nreached it. But none made a hostile move when it was seen that the son\nof the subchief was in command and that the strangers seemed friendly.\nYuara spoke, briefly but authoritatively, and the weapons sank. Then,\nwith a word to his three companions, he ducked through the doorway. The\nother three remained where they were.\n\n\"We shall have to wait now, comrades, until Yuara tells his father and\nthe chief about us,\" Louren\u00e7o said. \"So let us take off our packs and\nrest.\"\n\nHe set the example by laying his rifle on the ground, unslinging his\npack, squatting beside it, and coolly rolling a cigarette. Apparently he\nwas paying no attention whatever to the savages, who watched his every\nmove. But McKay, glancing at him as he followed suit, saw that, for all\nhis seeming unconcern, the Brazilian bush rover was keenly watchful and\nthat his gun lay within reach of his hand.\n\nFrom within the tribal house sounded the monotonous voice of Yuara.\nAfter listening a moment Louren\u00e7o quietly addressed the nearest warrior.\nA slightly surprised looked passed over the cannibal's face. He replied,\nand a slow conversation ensued.\n\nMeanwhile the others looked over the array of savage fighting men.\nExcept for difference of stature, build, and expression, they were as\nlike as brothers. All were light skinned--hardly darker than the\nriver-tanned whites themselves; all had straight-set eyes, with no hint\nof the slant often found among the Indians of the Amazon headwaters; and\nthe cheek bones of all were fairly low. Their average stature was a\nlittle under six feet, and most of them had an athletic symmetry of\nphysique. Their feet, McKay noticed, were small and shapely.\n\nAll wore tall feather headdresses of parrot and mutum plumes. All had\nthe scarlet and black rings around the eyes, the streaks from temple to\nchin, the wavy design on their bodies. And each wore in the cartilage of\nhis nose a pair of small feathers slanting outward. At another time and\nunder other circumstances the white men might have smiled at those nose\nfeathers, which resembled odd mustaches; but as they studied the austere\nfaces around them they found no occasion for merriment. Nor was the\ntension lessened by the sight of the weapons grasped in the strong hands\nof the warriors.\n\nGreat bows and arrows, such as the hunters had borne, were supplemented\nhere by the long clubs of heavy wood and by ugly spears. The clubs\nterminated in balls studded with jaguar teeth. The spears were triple\npronged, each prong ending in a saw-toothed araya bone and each bone\ndarkened by the fatal wurali. Frightful weapons they were--the one\ndesigned to smash skulls and tear out brains, the other to stab and\npoison at the same thrust.\n\nLouren\u00e7o stopped talking, and the others observed that now the wild men\nstood more easily, their holds on their weapons loosened.\n\n\"I have shown them, Capitao, that I can speak their tongue, and told\nthem we go to visit the chief Monitaya as friend,\" he explained. \"They\ntell me Monitaya has grown great since last I saw him. Another tribe\nwhich lost its chief and subchiefs by a swift sickness has joined his\nown, and he now rules two big _malocas_ together. He is a powerful\nfighter, and if he is friendly to us we have a good chance of success.\nAh! here is Yuara.\"\n\nThe son of the subchief came through the doorway as he spoke, followed\nby an older man whose facial resemblance and ornaments indicated that he\nwas the subchief himself. His headgear was more elaborate than that of\nhis men, and around his shoulders and down his chest hung a brilliant\nfeather dress, while a wide belt of green, blue, and black plumes\nencircled his hips. Yuara himself had inserted feathers in his nose and\ndonned a headband of tall parrot plumes a trifle more ornate than those\nworn by the ordinary fighters, and somehow the simple addition seemed to\ntransform him into a bigger, fiercer man. Also, his eyes now held a\nsmoldering light which had not been there before.\n\nThe older man, Rana, the subchief, glanced swiftly along the line of new\nfaces. Then his gaze returned to McKay. His mouth set and his\ncountenance turned hard. He spoke curtly to Yuara, who replied with one\nword. After another long, unpleasant look at McKay, who stared coldly\nback at him, Rana grunted a few words and re-entered the house.\n\nLouren\u00e7o, nonplussed by the frigidity of the subchief where he had\nexpected gratitude or at least hospitality, glanced questioningly at\nYuara. But the young man stood mute, looking straight ahead.\n\n\"The subchief says we shall enter and see the chief. We must leave our\nguns outside.\"\n\n\"Don't like that,\" muttered McKay. \"That subchief looks ugly.\"\n\n\"But we must obey or provoke a fight, Capitao. Besides, our rifles would\nbe useless inside, as they would be instantly seized if we lifted them.\nSo let us make the best of it. But I think you can carry your pistols\nwith you; they are covered by the holsters, and I do not believe these\npeople know what they are. And since Rana spoke only of guns, we will\nkeep our machetes. Come.\"\n\n\"Wait a second.\"\n\nMcKay dived a hand into his haversack and brought forth a heavy hunting\nknife with a gaudy red-and-white bone handle, sheathed and attached to a\nleather belt.\n\n\"Brought this along as a present for some Indian who might do us a good\nturn,\" he explained. \"Been thinking of giving it to Yuara, but now I'll\npass it to the chief. Might make a difference. All right, let's go.\"\n\nWith confident tread, but with some misgiving, the five advanced,\nleaving guns and packs on the ground. One by one they bent low and got\nthrough the doorway. Yuara, with a word to a clubman and a motion to the\nequipment, followed the whites, trailed in turn by his three companions\nof the forest. The clubman, after a curious inspection of the packs,\nstood on guard among them, his bludgeon grasped loosely but\nsuggestively, ready to prevent any undue inquisitiveness by the rest.\nBut soon he found himself alone, for the other tribesmen transferred\ntheir attention and themselves to the interior of the _maloca_.\n\nWithin the house the soldiers of fortune halted a moment, adjusting\ntheir vision to the sudden diminution of light. Except for the sunshine\npouring in at the smoke hole above and at the tiny door behind, the only\nlight in the big room came from small cooking fires scattered about the\nplace, and for the moment details were withheld from the newcomers'\nsight. Then they found themselves in what seemed a labyrinth of poles\nand hammocks.\n\nThrough this confusion Yuara passed with familiar step, and in his wake\nthe travelers went to a central fire around which was a comparatively\nclear space. Beyond, in a big hammock dyed with the symbolic scarlet and\nblack and tasseled with many squirrel tails, sat a fat, small-eyed,\nheavy-jawed man whose elaborate feather dress and authoritative air\nproclaimed him chief. Beside him stood Rana and another subchief, lean\nand somber-faced. Behind this bulwark of tribal might huddled the women\nand children, staring wide-eyed. As the visitors stopped and returned\nthe chief's unwinking regard the warriors packed themselves at their\nbacks, blocking all chance of exit.\n\nWhen the shuffle of feet had died and no sound was audible, Yuara began\nto talk. In his deliberate way he told the complete narrative of his\njourney, which previously he had sketched only in outline. His three\ncompanions corroborated his tale from time to time by nods, and when the\ndiscovery of the slain hunter's bones was described one of those three\nstepped forward and laid the dead man's weapons on the ground before the\nchief. As Yuara went on he touched his bandaged arm and pointed to McKay\nand Knowlton. And as he concluded he motioned toward Louren\u00e7o.\n\nIgnorant of the Indian language, but guessing the nature of his talk\nfrom his motions, the Americans stood patiently awaiting the next move.\nFor a time all three of the chiefs remained silent; but all of them\nstudied McKay, standing bolt upright with arms folded and the\nbelt-wrapped knife partly concealed in the hollow of one elbow. Though\nit was evident that Yuara had given the captain full credit for saving\nhis life, the faces of the head men showed no sign of friendliness. In\nfact, their expressions were distinctly ominous.\n\nAt length the chief turned his eyes to Louren\u00e7o. The veteran bushman\npromptly stepped forward and said his say. At the end he turned, took\nfrom McKay the knife, unrolled the belt, and dangled the weapon before\nthe eyes of the rulers. They stared at it in obvious ignorance of its\ncharacter. Not until the Brazilian drew the blade from its sheath and\nthe glint of steel struck their vision did they show recognition. Then\nChief Suba grunted, his little eyes lit up, and he reached for it.\n\nFor a few minutes he sat gloating over the gift, admiring the bone\nhandle, hefting the weight of the long blade, while the subchiefs gazed\nin envy. When he looked up his face was beaming. But then the sour-faced\nsubchief at his left hand muttered something, and Suba's visage\ndarkened. His eyes rested again on McKay, went to the bandaged arm of\nYuara, dropped to his knife--the first steel knife ever owned by him or\nany man of the Suba tribe--and rose again to the black-bearded captain.\nAbruptly then he spoke out.\n\nLouren\u00e7o stared in blank astonishment. After a puzzled moment he shook\nhis head as if unable to believe he had heard aright. Suba, scowling,\nrepeated what he had said. Louren\u00e7o shook his head again, this time in\nvehement denial, and began to talk. But Suba, rising with surprising\nagility for a man of his weight, stopped him imperiously and spoke with\nfinality. Slowly the Brazilian nodded and turned to his captain.\n\n\"I do not understand this, Capitao. But these are the words of the\nchief:\n\n\"'The white man with the black beard tries a trick, but it does not\ndeceive the free men of the forest. The thing which he thinks to be\nhidden in his own heart is known to Suba and his chiefs. It is known\nalso to the chief Monitaya, and to his chiefs, and to his men also. The\nwhite man is bold. And now his own boldness shall be his death.\n\n\"'Since the white man has said he goes to visit the chief Monitaya, and\nsince by some demon's power the white man has saved the life of Yuara,\nwho is a man of Suba, the men of Suba will allow him to go in peace from\nthis place. But Suba will see that he and his companions go to Monitaya,\nwho will know how to deal with his visitors. The men of Suba will take\nthe strangers at once to the canoes and carry them to Monitaya.\n\n\"'If the white man of the black beard and the black mind thought the men\nof the jungle blind to the foulness he would do here, he is a fool. It\nis useless for him or his men to lie and say they know not what Suba\nmeans. Let him look into his own heart and he will know well.\n\n\"'Suba has spoken.'\n\n\"Something is wrong, Capitao, but I do not know what it is. It will do\nno good to argue. Let us go at once.\"\n\nSuba snarled commands to the warriors. They trooped toward the door.\nWithout another word or glance at the three chiefs Louren\u00e7o stalked\nafter the Indians, and his comrades followed with stiff dignity.\n\nOutside, the savages picked up the rifles and packs and carried them to\nthe creek, where small canoes lay. The five strangers were allowed to\ncrowd themselves together in a four-man canoe, but their guns and packs\nwere distributed among four other dugouts, into which armed paddlers\nentered. Other Indians brought provisions to the outgoing craft. In a\nvery short time the leading canoe started off downstream, followed by\nthe boat of the white men, behind which the other craft pressed close\nand vigilant.\n\nThey swung in among the trees, and the _maloca_ of Suba was blotted out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nBLACKBEARD\n\n\n\"Well,\" said Knowlton, after a period of silent paddling, \"we have met\nthe enemy and we are his'n. No harm done so far, though, and if old man\nCalisaya, or whatever his name is, wants to act nasty we can send him\nand a few others along the road to glory with our gats. We'll travel the\nsame road, of course, but we'll take company with us.\"\n\n\"_Si_, senhor,\" Pedro agreed. \"And besides your pistols we still have\nour machetes. Yet I believe Louren\u00e7o's words to the chief Monitaya will\nmake all well. But I cannot help wondering--\" He glanced at McKay.\n\n\"I'm wondering, too, Pedro,\" said the captain. \"It's hardly possible\nthat these people know why we're here, and hardly likely that they have\nany interest in the Raposa. Lord knows I've nothing else up my sleeve.\nIt's a riddle to me.\"\n\nIt remained a riddle to the rest, for no explanation could be gleaned\nfrom the Mayorunas. At the first halt, which did not come until nearly\nsundown, the Americans discovered that one of the men in the fore canoe\nwas Yuara, who had been lying in the bottom of the craft and sleeping\nall the afternoon. From him Louren\u00e7o attempted to get information as to\nthe reason for Suba's enmity--but in vain. The tall fellow spoke not a\nword in reply, and his face remained unreadable.\n\nCamp was made, and by Yuara's direction the packs of the adventurers\nwere restored to them. The rifles, however, remained under guard of\nsavages appointed by the subchief's son. When the night meal was out of\nthe way nothing remained but to seek hammocks and sleep, for further\nattempts at conversation by Louren\u00e7o met with the same silent rebuff\nfrom every cannibal addressed. None showed active hostility by either\nlook or manner, but it was plain that between wild and civilized men\nstood a wall--a wall not too high for the jungle dwellers to leap over\nin deadly action if occasion should be given. Wherefore the whites held\nthemselves aloof, said little, and slept early.\n\n\"I am glad Yuara is with us,\" Louren\u00e7o said. \"As he promised, he does\nnot forget what was done for him. He will keep this band in control, and\nunless I am much mistaken he will tell Monitaya all he knows of us,\nwhich surely will not do us any harm. At any rate, we can sleep in\nsafety to-night. And since it does no good to puzzle about what is gone\nby or to worry about what has not yet to come to pass, let us sleep\nnow.\"\n\n\"Ho-hum!\" yawned Tim. \"Renzo, ye spill more solid sense to the square\ninch than any feller I seen in a long time. We're here because we're\nhere; to-day's dead and to-morrer ain't born yet, and li'l' Timmy Ryan\nhits the hay right now. Night, gents.\"\n\nSo, surrounded by man eaters, the trailers of the Raposa slept far more\nsecurely than on any night down the river when their companions had been\nsupposedly civilized Peruvians. Whether a watch was kept by their guards\nduring the night they neither knew nor cared, since they had no\nintention of attempting escape.\n\nThey awoke to find the men of Suba diminished in number by half. Yuara,\ndeigning to speak for the first time since leaving the _maloca_,\nexplained that the absent men had gone hunting for their breakfasts.\nBefore long the hunters came straggling back, bearing monkeys and birds,\nwhich were divided among their companions. None of this meat was offered\nto the prisoners, who ate unconcernedly from their pack rations. Tim,\nafter watching the Indians sink their sharp-filed teeth into broiled\nmonkey haunches and tear the meat from the bones, snorted and turned his\nback to them.\n\n\"Look like a gang o' bloody-faced devils gobblin' babies,\" he muttered.\n\"I'll believe now they're cannibals, all right.\"\n\nSo uncomfortably apt was his simile that the others grimaced and turned\ntheir eyes elsewhere until the savage meal was finished. Then their\nattention became riveted on a queer proceeding at the canoe wherein\nYuara had journeyed yesterday.\n\nTo the gunwales amidships two of the men fastened a couple of small\ncrotched posts. In the forks was laid a pole, crosswise of the boat, and\nfrom this, by slender fiber cords, four slabs of wood were hung.\nStrolling down to the canoe, the travelers found that athwart its bottom\nhad been laid a crosspiece supporting two shorter crotched posts,\nbetween which stretched another transverse pole; and from this pole in\nturn the lower ends of the four slabs had been suspended. Now the\nsavages joined the tips of each pair of slabs by carved end sections,\nand the contrivance seemed to be complete--a sort of grate, its bars\nsloping at an angle of forty-five degrees.\n\nAs the Americans eyed the arrangement in perplexity, one of the crew\npicked up from the bow of the canoe a pair of mallets the heads of which\nwere wrapped in hide. With these he struck the slabs in rapid\nsuccession. Out rolled four notes of astonishing volume--the first four\nnotes of the musical scale. Again and again he ran them over, then\nstopped. The deep tones thrummed away along the creek and died.\n\n\"By George! a big xylophone!\" Knowlton exclaimed, admiringly.\n\n\"It sure talks right out loud,\" said Tim. \"Lot o' class to these guys,\nat that. Bet this is their brass band, and we'll go rip-snortin' into\nthe next town like we was on parade. Oughter have some flags to hang up\nin the boats, and mebbe a drum corps to help out. Wisht I had a tin\nwhistle or somethin' and I'd join the orchester. I can toot a whistle\nfine.\"\n\n\"My favorite instrument is the old-fashioned dinner horn,\" laughed\nKnowlton. \"But I think you're wrong--this is some kind of signaling\napparatus.\"\n\n\"You have it right, senhor,\" Louren\u00e7o affirmed. \"I have heard this sort\nof thing used, though I never before saw the instrument itself. Those\nnotes will carry at least five miles, and the cannibals send messages by\nstriking the bars in different order. This run which we have just heard\nis always used first, and no message is sent until a reply is received.\"\n\n\"Bush telegraph,\" nodded McKay. \"First call your operator and then shoot\nthe message in code. Pretty ingenious for a bunch of absolute savages.\"\n\nLouren\u00e7o turned to Yuara and asked a question. Yuara curtly replied.\n\n\"He says, Capitao, that this is to tell Monitaya we come. But we now are\ntoo far off for Monitaya's men to hear. The bars are made ready before\nstarting so that they can be used as soon as we are within hearing. He\nsays also that we start now.\"\n\nThe Mayorunas already were entering their canoes. With cool deliberation\nthe whites gathered up their equipment and settled themselves for the\njourney at whose end lay either life or death. The boat of Yuara\nstarted, and once more the flotilla was on its way.\n\nFor an hour or more it swung on among the forested hills before the\ntelegraph instrument was put to use. Then it paused, and the sonorous\nvoice of the xylophone spoke to the jungle. A period of waiting brought\nno reply.\n\nThe canoe moved on for a mile. Again the mallets beat the wood in the\nascending scale of the call. And then, faint, mellow, far off, sounded\nthe answer.\n\nWhile every man sat silent the bars boomed out their fateful news. Slow,\nbrief, deep as a bell tolling a dirge, a reply rolled back. And with the\nsolemnity of a funeral cort\u00e9ge the canoes once more moved on, unhurried,\ninexorable, the measured swing of the paddles beating like a pulse of\ndoom.\n\nAt length the crew of Yuara held their paddles. Yuara himself turned\ntoward the second canoe and talked a minute. A signal to his men, and\nhis boat proceeded. All the others remained where they were.\n\n\"He goes to Monitaya to speak of us,\" said Louren\u00e7o. \"He will return. We\nhave only to wait.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" grunted Tim, disgustedly. \"We'll wait till night if he takes as\nlong to go through his rigmarole as he done yesterday. If I got to fight\nI want to hop to it, not set round in the shade o' the shelterin' palm\nwhile them guys are heatin' up the stewpot. This waitin' stuff gits my\ngoat.\"\n\n\"You might sing us a song, senhor, to pass the time,\" Pedro suggested,\nwith a tight-lipped smile.\n\n\"Say, I'll do that, jest to show these guys I don't give a rip. And\nwhile their ears are dazzled by me melody I'm goin' to git me holster\nunbottoned and me masheet kinder limbered up. Git set. Here it comes:\n\n    \"Ol' Hindyburg thought he was swell,\n        Pa-a-arley-voo!\n    He made the kids in Belgium yell,\n        Pa-a-arley-voo!\n    But the Yanks come over with shot and shell\n    And Hindyburg he run like hell,\n        Rinkydinky-parley-voo!\"\n\nUnder cover of his outbreak, which made the savages clutch their weapons\nand glare at him in mingled suspicion and amazement, there proceeded a\nfurtive loosening of pistols and machetes.\n\n\"A noble sentiment, and more or less appropriate,\" grinned Knowlton.\n\"But don't give them another spasm for a few minutes, or they may rise\nup and kill us all in self-defense. They're on the ragged edge now.\"\n\n\"Aw, them guys dunno how to appreciate good singin'. But I should worry;\nI got me gat fixed now like I want it.\"\n\nTime dragged past. The Americans and Brazilians smoked and exchanged\ncasual comments on subjects far removed from their present environment.\nThe Mayorunas watched them with unceasing vigilance, as if expecting a\nsudden break for life and liberty. Their chief had intimated that\nMonitaya would kill these men; and now was their last chance to try to\ndodge death. But neither the black-bearded McKay nor any of his mates\nmanifested the slightest concern. And at last the canoe of Yuara came\nback.\n\nIt came, however, without Yuara himself. The son of Rana had remained at\nthe _malocas_ ahead, whence he sent the command to advance. Closely\nhemmed in by the men of Suba, the white men's boat surged onward at a\nbrisk pace. Around a bend in the creek it went, and at once the domain\nof Monitaya leaped into view.\n\nTwo big tribal houses, each considerably larger than the one of Suba,\nrose pompously in a wide cleared space beside the stream. Before them,\nranged in a semicircle, stood hundreds of Mayorunas--men, women,\nchildren--all silently watching the canoes of the newcomers. In the\ncenter of the arc, like the hub of a human half wheel, a small knot of\nmen waited in aloof dignity, four of them adorned with the ornate\nfeather dresses of subchiefs, backed by a dozen tall, muscular savages,\neach armed with a huge war club. Before all stood a powerful,\nmagnificently proportioned savage belted with a wide girdle of squirrel\ntails, decked with necklaces of jaguar teeth and ebony nuts, crowned by\nplumes which in loftiness and splendor surpassed all other headgear\npresent--the great chief Monitaya.\n\nAt the shore, beside a row of empty canoes, Yuara was waiting. He\nmentioned for his men to bring their dugouts to the regular landing\nplace, and when they obeyed he gave commands. Then he turned and walked\ntoward Monitaya.\n\n\"I go,\" stated Louren\u00e7o, rising. \"You stay here until called. Yuara has\ntold his men to leave all weapons in the canoes.\"\n\nHe walked away after the son of Rana, and if any misgiving was in his\nheart it did not show in his confident step. Halting before the big\nchief, he began talking as coolly as if there were not the least doubt\nof welcome for himself and those with him. Monitaya gave no sign of\nrecognition, of friendliness, or of enmity. Proud, statuesque, he stood\nmotionless, his deep eyes resting on those of the Brazilian.\n\n\"Sultry weather,\" remarked McKay.\n\n\"Just so, Capitao,\" agreed Pedro, narrow eyed. \"We shall soon know\nwhether we shall have storm.\"\n\n\"Indications are for violent thunder and lightning soon,\" Knowlton\ncontributed. \"See those husky clubmen awaiting? Looks as if a public\nexecution were about to be pulled off.\"\n\n\"Yeah. But say, ain't that chief a reg'lar he-man, though! No\npot-bellied fathead like that there, now, Suby guy. Hope I don't have to\ndrill him. I bet I won't, neither. He looks like he had brains.\"\n\nHoping Tim was right, but dubious, all watched the progress of the\nparley. Louren\u00e7o evidently was stating his case in logical sequence,\nrecalling to the chief's mind the time when he had led him to revenge\nagainst the Peccaries of Peru, then going on to tell of the arrival of\nthe strangers and the object of their search. Yuara's sudden, quick\nglance at him showed that the Raposa had been mentioned for the first\ntime. A little later his face became slightly sullen, and the watchers\nguessed that Louren\u00e7o was now referring in somewhat uncomplimentary\nterms to the treatment received in the _maloca_ of Suba. Soon after that\nthe Brazilian ended his speech.\n\nIn a deep, quiet tone Monitaya spoke first to Louren\u00e7o, then to one of\nhis subchiefs. The bushman beckoned to his waiting companions. At the\nsame time the subchief stepped out and called two names. As McKay,\nKnowlton, Tim, and Pedro arose and stepped ashore with the weaponless\nmen of Suba, out from the great human arc came two men. All advanced\ntoward the chief. And though the Americans were studying the central\nfigures as they walked, they also noticed that the pair of Mayorunas who\nhad been summoned were lame. One walked with a stiff knee, the other as\nif a whole leg was paralyzed.\n\n\"Squad--halt!\" muttered McKay. A step and a half and the four stood\naligned and alert, two strides from Monitaya.\n\nThe eyes of the chief dwelt long on McKay, and they were hard eyes.\nWithout shifting his gaze he grunted a few words. The two crippled\nIndians stumped forward and stared into McKay's face. Through a long\nminute the Americans felt a sinister tension grow in the air about them.\nThen, slowly, the cripples turned about and faced their ruler. In the\ntones of men sure of themselves, they spoke one word.\n\nWith the utterance of that word the tension broke. Through the long line\nof watching tribesmen ran a murmur. The clubmen relaxed from their ready\npoise. The subchiefs glanced at one another as if disappointed. And the\nstern face of Monitaya himself was transformed by a wide, friendly\nsmile.\n\nA sweeping gesture and the cordial timbre of the chief's voice told the\nAmericans plainly what Louren\u00e7o translated a moment later.\n\n\"We are welcome, comrades. We shall sleep in the _maloca_ of Monitaya\nhimself and a feast shall be made for us. Our lives have just hung on\none word, but now that the word is spoken we are safe. I cannot tell you\nmore now, for I do not wholly understand this matter myself as yet--but\nI shall learn. Now is the time, Capitao to give presents, if you have\nany for the chief.\"\n\n\"I have. But our packs are in the canoe, and I'll be hanged if I'll make\na beast of burden of myself at this stage of the game.\"\n\n\"I will have all the packs brought up, Capitao. The men of Suba took\nthem from us at their _maloca_; now they shall restore them before all\nthese people.\"\n\nHe addressed Monitaya affably, then spoke more brusquely to Yuara. That\nyoung man, whose previous austerity now had dissolved into open\nfriendliness, uttered four words. Immediately his men returned to the\ncanoes and brought up not only the packs, but the rifles.\n\nFrom his blanket roll McKay brought forth a cloth-wrapped package out of\nwhich he drew a half-ax, its blade gleaming dully under a protective\ncoating of grease, which he swiftly swabbed off. From his haversack he\nproduced a heavy chain of ruby-red beads. Under the bright sun the beads\nglowed like living things, and the glittering steel flashed back a\ndazzling beam. The two gifts together had cost considerably less than\nten dollars in New York, but to the chieftain they were priceless\ntreasures; and as McKay, with a formal bow, extended them to him, his\nface shone with delight. Yet he made no such greedy grab for them as had\nbeen displayed by Suba when tendered the knife. His acceptance was\nachieved with a calm dignity which brought a twinkle of approval to the\neyes of the white men.\n\nIn the same dignified manner he led the way to the _maloca_ which\nevidently was the older of the two and which had always been his home.\nThe semicircle of his subjects broke up into a disorderly crowd which\nstreamed after him and his guests or surrounded the men of Suba with\nholiday greetings. Within the tribal house the adventurers proceeded to\nthe central space where burned the chief's fire. There Monitaya ordered\ncertain hammocks removed to make room for those of the visitors. Soon\nthe travelers were seated at ease in their hanging beds, their packs and\nrifles lying on the ground beneath them, while near at hand clustered\ngroups of Mayorunas, staring at them in na\u00efve curiosity.\n\nPedro drew a long breath.\n\n\"Senhores, that was a very close call,\" he declared. \"As Louren\u00e7o says,\nour lives have hung on one word. What was that word, comrade?\"\n\n\"The word was, 'No,'\" answered Louren\u00e7o. \"Monitaya asked those two\ncrippled men, 'Is this the man?' As you saw, they looked at the capitao,\ngiving no attention to the rest of us. Then they said, 'No.' You will\nremember that the capitao was the one whom Suba also picked upon. As\nsoon as Monitaya finishes talking with those men I shall ask him what\nall this means.\"\n\nThe big chief was giving directions to a score of young fellows, who\npresently scattered to various parts of the house and accoutered\nthemselves for hunting. Thereupon Louren\u00e7o approached Monitaya with the\nfamiliarity of former acquaintance, being received with a good-humored\nsmile. For a time the two conversed. As they talked the smile of the\nruler faded and his face grew dark, while into the Brazilian's voice\ncame a wrathful growl. Finally both nodded. Louren\u00e7o returned to his\nhammock, frowning.\n\n\"Capitao, it is all because of your black hair and beard. Through all\nthe _malocas_ of the Mayorunas, far and near, has gone the word to watch\nfor a big, black-bearded man who is neither a Brazilian nor a Peruvian,\nbut of some country unknown to these people; and when such a man is\ncaught, to kill him and his companions without mercy. And the reason for\nsuch a command is this:\n\n\"For many moons the Mayorunas, especially those of the smaller and\nweaker _malocas_, have been losing women. From time to time sudden raids\nhave been made by gangs of gun-carrying Peruvian Indians and\n_mesti\u00e7os_--half-breeds--who shot down the defenders of the houses\nbefore they could reach their weapons, and carried off girls. This, of\ncourse, is nothing new here, for such things have happened occasionally\nfor many years. But within the past five years there has been a\ndifference in these attacks which has made them much more deadly.\n\n\"These raids used to be made always at night, and they were few and far\nbetween. But of late they have come about also in the day, at times when\nalmost all the men of the small _malocas_ were far out in the forest\nhunting meat and the women had little protection. Several chiefs have\nbeen killed by the raiders, who seemed to be acting according to an\nagreed plan, to be organized for this work, and to know when to strike\nand how to get away quickly. And what is more, the men who did this were\nnot chance parties who came only to get women for themselves and then\nstayed away. The same men came back time after time.\n\n\"A few of these were killed, but only a few; and all the dead were\nPeruvians. Being dead, they could tell nothing. But the Mayorunas felt\nthat all these raids were directed by one mind. And they became sure of\nthis when one captured girl escaped by killing a Peruvian with his own\nknife and returned to her own _maloca_. She said the raiders took her\nand the other girls to the big man with the black beard, who waited at a\nsafe place a day's march from the tribal house.\n\n\"A few weeks later another small _maloca_ several miles from here was\nattacked at night while two men of Monitaya were there, having stayed\nout too late on a hunting trip and taken refuge with their neighbors\nuntil day. Both these men were hit and crippled by bullets in the wild\nshooting that opened the attack. One was struck in the knee, the other\nin the lower part of the back. But both caught a glimpse of the leader's\nface and saw that he was the black-bearded man himself.\n\n\"So you see, Capitao, why we have been near death. Suba and Monitaya\nboth thought you were the man. We were lucky to escape alive from Suba,\nand still more lucky that hero were two men who knew the face of the\nblackbeard.\"\n\n\"Schwandorf!\" barked McKay.\n\n\"Yes, Capitao, it must be the German--\"\n\n\"I know it's Schwandorf! And I know his game! He's a slaver!\"\n\n\"A slaver?\"\n\n\"That's it. Knew I'd seen that sneak before. He worked the same game in\nBritish Guiana eight years ago on a small scale. Had a gang of tough\nbush niggers from over in Dutch Guiana to do his dirty work. Stole\nMacusi girls--they're the best-looking Indians in B. G.--and sold them\nlike cattle to gold miners. Cleaned up quite a pot before the English\ngot on to him, but had to get out of the country on the hot foot--didn't\nhave time to take his gold with him. His name wasn't Schwandorf over\nthere, and he had no beard; he was thinner, too, and posed as a Russian;\nbut he's the man. Must have made his get-away by the back door--down the\nBranco to the Amazon. Now he's running Mayoruna girls into Peru. He\ncould sell them to rubber men or miners and make good money, eh,\nLouren\u00e7o?\"\n\n\"_Si._\"\n\n\"Sure. And that's why he wanted to kill off his Peruvians--they knew too\nmuch; probably were trying to bleed him for hush money. He must have a\nregular slave route and a gang of border cutthroats to do his\nraiding--men who don't go downriver. Murderer, slaver--wonder how many\nother crimes are on his soul.\"\n\n\"Them two are enough,\" growled Tim. \"And he 'ain't got no soul.\"\n\n\"No soul,\" echoed Pedro. \"You have said it, Senhor Tim. And if ever\nthese people capture him he soon will have no body.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nFEVER\n\n\nIn the _maloca_ of Monitaya a feast was in the making.\n\nFires glowed all about the great room. Hunters came in, bearing birds or\nbeasts which were placed before the tribal ruler for inspection and\napproval. Fishermen armed with tridents or crude harpoons arrived with\nsizable trophies of their skill. And at length two young bowmen advanced\nproudly with a freshly killed wild hog. After glancing at this the chief\nadded to his usual nod a few words of praise which made the huntsmen\ngrin with all their pointed teeth.\n\nLouren\u00e7o, squatting comfortably on a jaguar skin beside the lavishly\ndecorated hammock of Monitaya, carried on a lazy-toned monologue which\nprobably dealt with his various experiences since his last meeting with\nthese people and which appeared to interest and amuse the chief. The\nothers, lolling back in mingled fatigue and relief from tension, studied\nthe interior of the place and watched the activities around them.\n\nAs in the _maloca_ of Suba, the small forest of poles and hammocks\nseemed a higgledy-piggledy maze wherein was neither beginning nor end.\nYet, as the newcomers took time to observe it, they presently found that\nthe confusion was only apparent and that there existed an efficient and\norderly arrangement. The hammocks, seemingly slung from any available\npair of poles in utter disregard of one another, really were arranged in\ntriangles. On the ground under the hanging beds lay woven grass mats and\nhides of the sloth and the jaguar; and in the space inclosed by each\ntrio of hammocks burned a small fire. The hammocks were the beds of men,\nthe mats and furs the couches of women and children, and each fire was\nthe focal point of the family residing in that triangle.\n\nAbove the hammocks, from transverse poles, were suspended the weapons of\nthe men: the great bows, the long blowguns, the fighting spears whose\ndeadly points now were sheathed in thick scabbards of grass, the\nunpoisoned fish spears and harpoons. From these poles also hung the\nquivers of arrows and darts and the small rubber-covered pouches wherein\na little fresh poison was carried by warrior or hunter. Thus both the\nground and the air were utilized, and by the compactness of the\narrangement an entire family with its worldly goods, was enabled to live\nin a comparatively small space. Looking around the wide room and\nremembering the big half circle of Indians who had stood outside, the\ntwo ex-officers estimated that in this tribal house and its twin dwelt\nseven hundred people.\n\nTim and Pedro, less interested in the Mayoruna domestic economy than in\nthe Mayorunas themselves, were scanning the figures moving about in the\nreddish haze of smoke. Most of them were women, all nude and na\u00efvely\nunconscious of any need of clothing. Like the men of the tribe, they\nbore the red and black rings and streaks on face and body; but, unlike\nthe males, each wore a facial ornament in the shape of an oval piece of\nwood thrust through the lower lip. From time to time those near by\nglanced up from their work and gave the new men unmistakably friendly\nlooks--particularly several young but well-grown girls who obviously\nwere still unmated. In fact, these last smiled openly at the lithe,\nhandsome Pedro, and red Tim was by no means overlooked.\n\n\"I got me orders,\" said Tim, _sotto voce_, \"and I'm danged if I crack a\nsmile back at them girls. But I sure feel like grinnin'. Watch yourself,\nold-timer; they're tryin' to flirt with ye.\"\n\nPedro, mindful of watchful eyes, turned his gaze to Tim's face before\nallowing himself to smile. Then he laughed.\n\n\"Do not fear,\" he said. \"My heart is still my own.\"\n\n\"Same here. Specially when I remember these females would grin jest the\nsame if them club swingers had spattered our brains all over the front\nyard awhile back. But I wisht sombody'd give the girls a nightie or\nsomethin' to wear. I been around some and I seen quite a lot, but I\nain't used to bein' vamped by a bunch of undressed kids with goo-goo\neyes the size of a plate o' fish balls. I'm only a bashful country kid\nfrom N'Yawk.\"\n\n\"Live and learn,\" chuckled Pedro. \"And clothes really have nothing to do\nwith modesty.\"\n\n\"True for ye. Clothes is mostly a disguise, anyhow, specially with\nwomen, and an awful expense, besides. These guys are lucky, I'll say;\nthey 'ain't got to buy their wives no fur coats or silk stockin's or\nnothin'. All the same, I got all I can do to hold me face straight when\nI see these li'l owl-eyes givin' us the glad look. I'd oughter stayed\nback in Remate de Males, where a feller can wink at a woman without\ngittin' all his pardners massacreed.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it would not be fatal, now that we are guests of the chief. But\nit is best to take no chances.\"\n\n\"Safety first. That's us. Grin at one of 'em and another might git sore\nbecause she missed out, and first thing ye know ye've started somethin'\nwithout meanin' to. Let's look at somethin' harmless--one o' them\npoisoned spears, f'r instance.\"\n\nAt that moment Monitaya and Louren\u00e7o both arose, the chief to inspect in\nperson the progress of the arrangements for the feast, the bushman to\nreturn to his companions with additional news.\n\n\"Monitaya tells me,\" he said, \"that his people have lost girls in other\nways than by the murderous attacks of the gunmen. A number of young\nwomen who have gone into the bush near their _malocas_ to get urucu and\ngenipapa, which they use to make the red and black body dyes, have\ndisappeared. So have several who went to the creeks for their daily\nbaths. Warriors who tried to trail them have found the footprints of a\nfew men, but always lost them at water. The girls had been taken away in\ncanoes. Even this tribe of Monitaya, which never has been attacked by\nnight raiders because it is too strong, has not been safe from these\nstealthy woman stealings by daylight. Three girls have been taken from\nhere within the past two moons, and others have disappeared from other\n_malocas_.\"\n\n\"Hm! And Schwandorf hasn't been here recently,\" said Knowlton.\n\n\"No. It must be that he has agents who work when he is not here, or else\nthis is done without his knowledge. I have told Monitaya what I know of\nSchwandorf, and he agrees that the women are taken as slaves. I have\nalso told him that when we return down the river we shall see that\nSchwandorf troubles the Mayorunas no more.\"\n\n\"Excellent,\" McKay approved. \"Have you asked him about the Raposa?\"\n\n\"Not yet. It does not pay to hurry business with these people. After the\nfeast is out of the way I will talk further with him.\"\n\nNo more was said for a time. The five lounged at ease, sniffing the\nsavory odors arising from the reddish clay pots and pans in which fruit,\nfish, or fowl was frying in tapir lard, or meat was stewing. At length a\nnumber of tall, shapely women, apparently the handsomest of their sex in\nthe tribe, laid a number of small mats in a semicircle on the ground\nbefore the chief, and placed thereon a steaming array of edibles. Furs\nwere placed outside the line of mats. From somewhere appeared all four\nof the subchiefs, accompanied by Yuara. Thereupon Monitaya, with a\nsmiling nod to his guests, squatted within the arc. Forthwith the\nvisitors advanced in a body, disposed themselves comfortably on the\nfurs, and assailed the viands with a vigor that brought a delighted grin\nto the face of their barbaric host.\n\nFried bananas, tender fish, broiled parrot which was not so tender, a\nthick stew of somewhat odorous meat seasoned with tart-tasting herbs,\nroast wild hog, and other things at whose identity the whites could not\neven guess, all were chewed and washed down with generous draughts of a\nrather sour liquid resembling beer. Remembering Louren\u00e7o's previous\nwarning, each man took care not to slight any portion of the meal or to\nshow distaste with anything, whether it pleased the palate or not.\nThroughout the feast the tall women hovered near, bringing fresh\nsupplies whenever a dearth of any edible appeared to threaten. And when\nat last the feasters were full to repletion Monitaya himself designated\nwhat he considered titbits to tempt them further.\n\n\"Gosh! if I eat any more I'll bust, and I'm danged if I'll bust jest to\nsatisfy this guy,\" asserted Tim. Wherewith he put one hand under his jaw\nand patted his stomach with the other, signifying that he was filled to\nthe throat. Pedro lifted his elbows, dropped his jaw, and made motions\nas if gasping for air. The chieftain grinned widely. The grin became a\nchuckling when Tim, after a vain attempt to rise, lay back at full\nlength on his rug and begged some one to make a cigarette.\n\n\"Guess I'll have to follow Tim's example,\" confessed Knowlton. And he\ntoo stretched out. Pedro and Louren\u00e7o also sprawled back. McKay, after\nglancing around, compromised with his dignity by leaning on one elbow.\nThe subchiefs and Yuara, with slight smiles, relaxed in various\npostures. Monitaya alone arose--not without some difficulty--and got\ninto his hammock, where he beamed down at them.\n\n\"Suppose this is a compliment to the chief,\" smiled McKay. \"He thinks he\nhas eaten us helpless.\"\n\n\"Speakin' for li'l old Tim Ryan, that ain't no joke, neither. Lookit all\nthe girls givin' us the laff. Who are them tall ones that's been rushin'\nthe grub? Waitresses or somethin'?\"\n\n\"Those are the chief's wives,\" Louren\u00e7o explained.\n\n\"Huh? Gosh! he's one brave guy, that feller! Two--four--six--eight--nine\nof 'em! Swell lookers, too. I s'pose he has his pick o' the whole crowd\nhere.\"\n\n\"He does not have to pick them Senhor Tim. They pick him. He and the\nsubchiefs are the only ones who can take more than one wife. When a girl\nwishes to become the wife of the great chief or of a subchief, she works\nfor months making feather dresses and necklaces and hammocks, and when\nthese are done she gives them all to him. If he likes her well enough he\naccepts the gifts and allows her to be a wife to him.\"\n\n\"Yeah? And she's flattered to death, I s'pose. Wisht they'd start\nsomethin' like that up home, or, anyways, fix it so's a feller could get\nan even break. Way it is now, a feller blows in every dollar he's got,\nand then when he's fixin' to git the ring the girl leaves him flat for\nsome other guy that 'ain't spent his dough yet. Yo-ho-hum! I'm goin' to\ntake a snooze right there on the table. Wake me up, somebody, when the\nnext mess call blows.\"\n\nAnd with no further ado he shut his eyes and drowsed.\n\nHis companions lolled for some time, smoking and watching the family\nlife of the ordinary members of the tribe, nodding now and then to some\nfriendly-looking young fellow, but ignoring the mischievous glances of\nthe girls. Monitaya himself lay back in his hammock and dozed. His\nwives, stepping nonchalantly among the strangers, cleared away the\nremnants of the feast by the simple process of eating them. Then they\ncarried off the clay vessels.\n\nFor another hour all hands rested. Then Monitaya sat up, stretched his\nbig arms, looked casually around the house to see that all was well, and\nsmiled down at his guests. Louren\u00e7o, rising to a squat, began a new\nconversation. After a while he turned to McKay.\n\n\"The Red Bones and the Mayorunas are neither friendly nor hostile toward\neach other, and there is little communication between them,\" he\nreported. \"From those _malocas_ to the town of the Red Bones is a\njourney of five long days, so the men of Monitaya hardly ever go there.\n\n\"The Raposa whom we seek is known to the men of Monitaya, but he never\nhas come here to the tribal houses. Hunters from this place have met him\nat times roving the wild forests, and some of the younger men fear him\nas the bad spirit of the jungle. The Mayorunas believe in two spirits or\ndemons, one good and one bad, and the bad one is said to roam the\nwilderness, seeking lone wanderers, whom he kills and eats; the people\nsometimes hear this demon howling at night in the dark of the moon. So\nthe young men have thought the Raposa might be this demon and have\navoided him--it would do no good to try to kill a demon, and it would\nonly make their own deaths more sure and horrible.\n\n\"But the older men do not believe this. They say the wild man is of the\nRed Bone people, and that the reason why his bones are marked in red on\nhis living body is that he is neither alive nor dead. If he were dead\nhis body would be thrown into the water and left there until his bones\nwere stripped by those cannibal fish, the piranhas, and then the bones\nwould be dyed red and hung up in his hut, as is the custom among those\npeople. If he were alive like other men he would not have those marks on\nhis body, but would wear only the tribal face paint. The bone paint on\nhim is a sign to all the _Ossos Vermelhos_ that he is alive, but dead,\nand is not to be treated like other men.\"\n\n\"Crazy!\" exclaimed Knowlton.\n\n\"Yes. I think that is it. His body lives, but his mind is dead. Death in\nlife.\"\n\n\"Has he been seen lately?\"\n\nThe Brazilian repeated the question in the Indian tongue. The chief\nlooked toward a certain hammock some distance off, called a name, raised\nan imperative hand. A slender savage came forward. To him the chief\nspoke, then to Louren\u00e7o, who, as usual, relayed his information.\n\n\"This young hunter saw him six days ago while following a wild-hog trail\nfar out in the bush toward the Red Bone region. He came on the fresh\ntrack of a man who was following the same hogs, and later he caught up\nwith that man. It was the red-boned wild man, and the wild man was very\nlame, having a hurt foot. They stood and looked at each other, and then\nthe wild man walked away, watching him closely and ready to shoot with\nhis bow. After he disappeared in the forest this hunter heard a long,\nshrill laugh and words that sounded like 'Podavi.'\"\n\n\"Podavi--Poor Davy!\" ejaculated Knowlton. \"That's he, sure enough! Then\nhe's near his own town now--he won't go far with a bad foot. We'd better\nmove as soon as we can. Ask about an escort.\"\n\nOnce more the bushman conversed with Monitaya. The ruler's smile\ndisappeared. For some time he sat gazing out over the heads of all,\nevidently weighing matters in his mind. When he responded, however, it\nwas without hesitation.\n\n\"There is neither friendliness nor enmity between the two peoples, as\nhas been said,\" Louren\u00e7o stated. \"Our business among the Red Bones is\nour own affair, not that of Monitaya, and Monitaya will make no requests\nfor us. But in order that we may go safely and return without harm he\nwill send with us twenty of his best men. These men will have orders to\nprotect us at all times, unless fighting is caused by our making a\nneedless attack on the Red Bones. In that case the Mayorunas will do\nnothing to help us. They will only defend themselves.\"\n\n\"Fair enough!\" nodded McKay. \"Tell him we'll start no fight. If any\ntrouble comes it will be from the other fellows. We'll leave here\nto-morrow morning.\"\n\nLouren\u00e7o translated the promise into Mayoruna. But the chief seemed not\nto hear. His eyes had narrowed and were fixed on the face of Tim, who\nstill lay on his back and was giving no attention to what went on.\nFollowing his look, the bushman gazed critically at the red-haired man.\n\nTim's florid face had paled. His mouth was drawn and his eyes stared\nstraight up, wide and glassy. Slowly he rolled his head from side to\nside.\n\n\"Gee! Cap,\" he whispered, hoarsely, \"I et too much. My head aches so I'm\nfair blind, and I'm burnin' up. Gimme some water.\"\n\nWith a swift, simultaneous movement McKay and Knowlton put their hands\non his forehead. Louren\u00e7o and Pedro leaned closer and peered into his\nface. All four glanced at one another. Pedro nodded. His lips silently\nformed one dread word:\n\n\"Fever!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nFRUIT OF THE TRAP\n\n\nHeavy hypodermic doses of quinine, aided by Tim's rugged constitution\nand the fact that this was his first attack of the ravaging sickness of\nthe swamp lands, pulled him back to safety within the next two days. To\nsafety, but not to strength. Despite his stout-hearted assertions that\nhe was ready to hit the trail and \"walk the legs off the whole danged\noutfit,\" he was obviously in no condition to stand up under the grueling\npack work that lay ahead. Wherefore, McKay, after consultation with the\nothers of the party, and, through Louren\u00e7o, with Monitaya, gave him\ninflexible orders.\n\n\"You'll stay here. Stick in your hammock until you're in fighting trim.\nThen watch yourself. Don't pull any bonehead plays that'll get these\npeople down on you. Take quinine daily according to Knowlton's\ndirections--he's written them on the box. If we're not back in a\nfortnight Monitaya will send men to find out why. If they find that\nwe're--not coming back--you will be guided to the river, where you can\nget down to the Nunes place.\"\n\n\"But, Cap--\"\n\n\"No argument!\"\n\n\"But listen here, for the love o' Mike! I ain't no old woman! I can\nstand the gaff! I'm goin' with the gang!\"\n\n\"You hear the orders!\" McKay snapped, with assumed severity. \"Think we\nwant to be bothered with having you go sick again? You're out of shape\nand we've no room for lame ducks. You'll stay here!\"\n\nTim tried another tack.\n\n\"Aw, but listen! Ye ain't goin' to desert a comrade amongst a lot o' man\neaters--right in the place where I got sick, too. Soon's I git away from\nhere I'll be all right--\"\n\n\"That stuff's no good,\" the captain contradicted, with a tight smile.\n\"You didn't get fever here. It's been in your system for days. You got\nit back on the river. These people don't have it, or any other kind of\nsickness. I've looked around and I know. As for the man eaters, they're\nmighty decent folks toward friends. We're friends. You'll be under the\npersonal protection of Monitaya, and his word is good as gold. It's all\narranged, and you're safer here than you would be in New York.\"\n\nIn his heart the stubborn veteran knew McKay was right, but, like any\nother good soldier ordered to remain out of action, he grumbled and\ngrowled regardless. To which the ex-officers paid about as much\nattention as officers usually do. They went ahead with their own\npreparations.\n\n\"Be of good heart, Senhor Tim,\" Pedro comforted, mischievously. \"You\nwill not lack for company. The chief has appointed two girls to wait\nupon you at all times.\"\n\n\"Huh? Them two tall ones that's been hangin' round and fetchin' things?\nAre they mine?\"\n\n\"Yes. They are quite handsome in their way, and strong enough to help\nyou about if your legs remain weak. In that case you will probably be\nallowed to put your arms around them for support. I almost wish I could\nget fever, too.\"\n\nTim's voice remained a growl, but his face did not look so doleful as\nbefore.\n\n\"Grrrumph! I always seem to draw big females, and I don't like 'em.\nGimme somethin' cute like them li'l' frog dolls in Paree--sort o'\npee-teet and chick. Still, a feller's got to do the best he can. Mebbe\nI'll live till you guys git back.\"\n\nWith which he availed himself of the prerogative of a sick man and\ngrinned openly at the two comely young women who stood near at hand,\nawaiting any demand for services. They were not at all backward in\nreciprocating, and, despite the tribal paint and their labial ornaments,\nthe smiles softening their faces made them not half bad to look upon.\n\n\"'O death, where is thy sting?'\" laughed Knowlton. \"Be careful not to\nstrain your heart while we're away, Tim.\"\n\n\"Don't worry. It's a tough old heart--been kicked round so much it's\ngrowed a shell like a turtle. Besides, I seen wild women before I ever\ncome to the jungle.\"\n\nNotwithstanding his apparent resignation, however, Tim erupted once more\nwhen his comrades shouldered their packs, picked up their guns, and\nspoke their thanks and good-by to Monitaya. He arose on shaky legs and\ndesperately offered to prove his fitness by a barehanded six-round bout\nwith his commanding officer. When McKay, with sympathetic eyes but gruff\ntones, peremptorily squelched him he insisted on at least going to the\ndoor to watch his comrades start the journey from which they might or\nmight not return. Nor did he take advantage of his chance to hug the\ngirls on the way.\n\nWith one arm slung over the shoulders of a wiry young warrior who\ngrinned proudly at the honor of being selected to help a guest of the\ngreat chief, he followed the departing column out into the sunshine,\nwhere the entire tribe was assembled. And when the stalwart band had\nfiled into the shadows of the trees and vanished he stood for a time\nunseeing and gulping at something in his throat.\n\nStraight away along a vague path beginning at the rear of the _malocas_\nmarched the twenty-four, the two northerners bending under the weight of\ntheir packs, the pair of Brazilians sweeping the jungle with practiced\neyes, the score of Mayorunas striding velvet footed, resplendent in\nbrilliant new paint and headdresses, armed with the most powerful\nweapons of their tribe, and loftily conscious of the fact that they were\nchosen as Monitaya's best. Savage and civilized, each man was fit,\nalert, formidable. Nowhere in the loosely joined chain was a weak link.\n\nBefore the departure the Americans had been at some trouble to rid\nthemselves of Yuara, who, with his men, had tarried at the Monitaya\n_malocas_ during Tim's sickness. While Knowlton was giving his ripped\narm a final dressing he had calmly announced his intention of joining\nthe expedition into the Red Bone country, and it had taken some skillful\nargument by Louren\u00e7o to dissuade him without arousing his anger. All\nfour of the adventurers would gladly have taken him along had he not\nbeen hampered by his injury, but, under the ruthless rule barring all\nmen not in possession of all their strength, he had to be left.\n\nNow, as on the previous jungle marches, the way was led by two of the\ntribesmen, followed by the Brazilians and the Americans, after whom the\nmain body of the escort strode in column. The leader and guide, one\nTucu, was a veteran hunter, fighter, and bushranger, who had been more\nthan once in the Red Bone region and withal possessed the cool judgment\nof mature years and long experience; a lean, silent man who, though not\na subchief, might have made a good one if given the opportunity. With\nhim Louren\u00e7o had already arranged that a direct course should be\nfollowed, and that whenever dense undergrowth blockaded the way the\nmachete men should take the lead.\n\nFor some time no word was spoken. The path wound on, faintly marked, but\neasy enough to follow with Tucu picking it out. It was not one of the\nfrequently used trails of the Monitaya people, but a mere _picada_, or\nhunter's track; yet even this had its pitfalls to guard the tribal\nhouse. Soon after leaving the clearing Tucu turned aside, passed between\ntrees off the trail, went directly under one tree whose steep-slanting\nroots stood up off the ground like great down-pointing fingers, and\nreturned to the path. All followed without comment.\n\nA considerable distance was covered before any further sign of the\npresence of ambushed death was shown by the savages. Then it came with\ntragic suddenness.\n\nTucu grunted suddenly, and in one instant shifted his gait from the easy\nswing of the march to the prowl of a hunting animal. Behind him the line\ngrew tense. The click of rifle hammers and of safeties being thrown off\nbreech bolts blended with the faint slither of arrows being swiftly\ndrawn from quivers. Eyes searched the bush, spying no enemy.\n\nTwo more steps, and Tucu stopped, head thrust forward, eyes boring into\nsomething on the ground. The rest, taking care not to touch one\nanother's weapons, crowded around and looked down at the huddled form of\na man.\n\nA matted mass of black hair, a neck burned copper brown by sun, tattered\ncotton shirt and trousers, big, bare dirty feet, a rusty repeating rifle\nof heavy caliber--these were what they saw first. The man lay straight,\nhis face in the dirt, his hands a little ahead as if he had been\ncrawling forward at the moment of death. Tucu turned him on his back,\nrevealing a blanched yellow-brown face which was proof positive of his\nrace.\n\n\"Peruvian,\" said Pedro.\n\n\"What got him?\" demanded Knowlton. \"No wound on him.\"\n\nLouren\u00e7o questioned Tucu. The leader, who evidently knew just where to\nlook, tore open the thin shirt at the left side and pointed to a tiny\ndiscoloration surrounding a red dot under the ribs. He muttered a few\nlaconic words.\n\n\"A blowgun trap,\" Louren\u00e7o explained. \"The gun is set a little way\nbeyond here. This man, sneaking along the path, broke the little cord\nwhich shot the gun. The poisoned dart struck in his side. He must have\npulled out the dart, but he could not go far before his legs became\nparalyzed, and he fell. Then, still trying to crawl, he died.\"\n\nPedro picked up the dead man's gun and worked the lever. The weapon was\nfully loaded and showed no sign of recent firing. Pedro coolly pumped it\nempty, gathered up the blunt .44 cartridges, and pocketed them for his\nown use.\n\nTucu watched the proceeding in satirical approval. Then, leaving the\nbody where it lay, he went stooping along the path ahead, his keen eyes\nsearching the undergrowth. In a few minutes he returned with the\nblood-stained dart which, as Louren\u00e7o had guessed, the stricken prowler\nhad pulled from his flesh and dropped. This he passed to a blowgun man.\nThe latter carefully opened his poison pouch, redipped the point of the\ndart, held it a moment to dry in a shaft of sunlight, and slipped it\ninto his dart case among a score of unused missiles.\n\n\"No waste of ammunition here,\" was McKay's dry comment. \"What happens to\nthis corpse now?\"\n\nThrough Louren\u00e7o's mouth Tucu answered.\n\n\"It will be left here until police warriors come from the _malocas_.\nCertain men travel the paths daily to inspect the traps. When they find\nthis man they will cut off his hands and feet with their wooden knives\nand throw the rest aside to be eaten by the animals. He has not been\ndead long or he would have been devoured by some wild thing before we\ncame. The trail travelers will set the trap again and take the hands and\nfeet to the _malocas_, where they will be washed, cooked, and eaten.\"\n\nThe faces of the Americans contracted slightly. A simultaneous thought\nmade them flash startled glances at each other.\n\n\"Tim--\" Knowlton said, and paused. Louren\u00e7o smiled.\n\n\"No, Senhor Tim will not be expected to eat man meat,\" he assured them.\n\"I thought of that before we left--one never knows when these traps will\nyield human flesh. So, without letting Monitaya know why I spoke, I told\nhim you North Americans believed the flesh of an enemy to be poisonous,\nand that you would not eat it on that account. Monitaya will remember\nthat.\"\n\n\"By George! you have a head on your shoulders, old scout! I was worried\nfor a minute. If they offered Tim a broiled foot or a stewed hand he'd\ngo for his gun.\"\n\nBriefly Tucu spoke. The Mayorunas separated and went into the forest,\nseeking any sign of other enemies.\n\n\"Queer that this chap should come here alone--if he was alone,\" added\nKnowlton. \"Suppose he's the fellow that's been swiping stray girls? Or a\nspy?\"\n\n\"Neither, I think, senhor. The girls were captured by more than one man,\nand I doubt if this one had been here before. Probably he was one of\nthose lone prowlers of the bush whose hand is against every man. He is a\nhalf-breed, as you see, and came, perhaps, to steal a girl for himself.\nThe jungle is well rid of him.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. Guess you're right. Say, I'd like to see how that blowgun trap\noperates. Can't understand what blows the dart when nobody is here.\"\n\n\"I do not know, either, senhor. Perhaps Tucu will show us.\"\n\nThe savage guide, after a moment's hesitation, pointed along the trail\nand stalked away, the others at his heels. At a spot some fifteen yards\nfarther on he turned into the bush at the right, walked a few paces away\nfrom the path, turned again sharply to the left, advanced once more, and\nhalted. Before them, not easy to discern in the masking brush, even\nthough they were looking for it, hung the long barrel of the blowgun,\nlashed to a couple of small trees and pointing toward the path.\n\nTucu stepped to the mouthpiece of the slender tube and pointed to a\nsapling, just behind and in line with it, which had been cut off about\nshoulder-high from the ground. From the tip of this thin trunk dangled a\nwide strip of bark. The savage, having indicated this, stood as if the\naction of the device were perfectly clear.\n\n\"Too deep for me,\" admitted McKay, after a puzzled study of the tube and\nthe trunk. The others nodded agreement. Louren\u00e7o confessed to the Indian\nthe blindness of all.\n\nThereupon Tucu bent the sapling far over and released it. As it sprang\nerect the bark strip slapped the end of the gun. Also, the watchers saw\nsomething hitherto unnoticed--a thin, flexible vine attached to the top\nof the thin stump. Louren\u00e7o's face showed understanding.\n\n\"See, comrades, this is it: The little tree is bent far down and held by\nthe long vine. The vine passes around a low branch, then up over other\nlimbs, and out across the path, where it is fastened to a root near the\nground. A man following the path breaks the vine. The little tree then\nflies up and the bark sheet strikes the wide mouthpiece of the gun. The\nair forced into that mouthpiece by the blow of the bark shoots the\nlittle dart. The dart does not fly as hard as if blown by a man, but it\ngoes swiftly enough to pierce the skin of anything except a tapir. As\nsoon as the poison is in the blood the work is done.\"\n\n\"It sure is done,\" Knowlton echoed, thinking of the short distance\ncovered by the dead Peruvian after passing this spot. \"Mighty ingenious\napparatus. These people are no fools, I'll say.\"\n\n\"You say rightly,\" Pedro muttered. Turning, they went out to the path,\nlooking askance at the thin death tube as they passed along it.\n\nThe scouting Mayorunas returned, having found nothing. Tucu resumed his\nplace at the head of the line. Without a backward glance at the body\nsprawling in the trail at the rear, the column swung into its usual\ngait.\n\nThe Americans, silent before, were silent again. They had looked for the\nfirst time on the work of the Mayoruna traps; had observed the\ncold-blooded way in which the Indiana handled the still form on the\nground; had visualized the forthcoming mutilation of that body and the\nresultant cannibal rites. More vividly than ever before they realized\nthat these men and Monitaya himself were relentless creatures of the\njungle, and that, despite the present existent friendliness, there\nyawned between them and their barbarous allies an impassable gulf.\n\nFor the moment the jungle itself seemed a poisonous green abyss of\ncreeping, crawling, sneaking death. And though they had faced death too\noften in another land to fear it in any form, though they marched on\nwith unwavering step, their eyes were somber as in their hearts echoed\nthe last appeal of the man they had left behind them:\n\n\"Ye ain't goin' to desert a comrade amongst a lot o' man eaters--\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nTHE RED BONES\n\n\nFour days the expedition tramped steadily onward through the rugged\nlabyrinthine hills. Four nights its members slept in utter exhaustion.\nNeither by day nor by night was any sign of the Raposa seen, nor of any\nother human being.\n\nSo tired from the constant struggle did the Americans become that their\njaded brains began to picture the mysterious wild man as a mere\nlegendary creature, which they never would find even though they\nsearched the inscrutable forests until the end of time. Yet when, on the\nfifth day, Tucu informed them that they now were nearing the principal\nsettlement of the Red Bones, the announcement cheered them as if they\nwere about to enter a civilized city and there meet David Rand safe and\nsane.\n\nNot that any chance of striking his trail had been neglected in the\nmeantime. It was thoroughly understood that if he were met anywhere he\nwas to be made prisoner, and that thereafter the back trail should be\ntaken. Louren\u00e7o had impressed on Tucu the fact that the whole journey\nhad for its object the finding of the wild man, and that he must not be\nkilled if found. Since the Indians were not in the habit of hunting so\nassiduously anyone but a bitterly hated foe, it is quite possible that\nthey misunderstood the spirit of the quest and believed the \"dead-alive\"\nprowler would, if captured, undergo some extremely unpleasant treatment\nat the hands of the white men. But so long as it was made clear that the\nRaposa must be caught alive, if caught at all, Louren\u00e7o did not trouble\nabout what the Mayorunas might surmise.\n\nNow, as the end of the long, pathless trail approached, arose a question\nof which McKay had previously thought but had not spoken--how he was to\nconverse with the Red Bone chief. Louren\u00e7o asked Tucu whether the Red\nBones spoke the Mayoruna tongue. Tucu replied that they did not. He\nadded, however, that the languages were not so dissimilar as to prevent\nsome sort of understanding being reached between members of the two\ntribes. The veteran bushman nodded carelessly.\n\n\"When the tongue fails, Capitao, the hands still can talk,\" he said. \"It\ntakes more time and work, that is all. Ah, here is a path!\"\n\nIt was so. For the first time since leaving the Monitaya region a path\nlay under their feet. And for the first time Tucu and his fellow\nMayorunas, glancing along that faint track, showed hesitation.\n\n\"Why the delay?\" snapped McKay.\n\n\"They suspect traps. I will go ahead and feel out the way. I have done\nit before on other paths.\"\n\nAfter a few words to Tucu, Louren\u00e7o cut a long, slim pole. With this in\nhand he preceded the column, walking slowly, pausing sometimes,\ncontinually prodding the path, studying it with unswerving gaze as he\nprogressed. The thin but rigid feeler, strong enough to tip the cover of\nany pit or to spring any concealed bow or blowgun, was at least ten feet\nlong, and between the scout and the head of the line Tucu preserved\nanother ten-foot interval. Progress was necessarily slow, but it was\nsure.\n\nIn this fashion they advanced perhaps half a mile. Not once did they\nhave to leave the path, but Louren\u00e7o's caution did not diminish. Rather,\nit increased as they neared the Red Bone town. At length another path\njoined the one on which they were traveling. Here Louren\u00e7o paused for\nminutes, inspecting with extreme care the ground and the bush.\n\nSuddenly he cocked his head as if listening. Then, with a backward\nmotion of the hand to enjoin silence, he faced down the branch path and\nstood calmly waiting.\n\nTo those behind came a light rustle of leaves and a scuffle of moving\nfeet; a sudden cessation; then Louren\u00e7o's voice speaking to some one\nconcealed behind the intervening undergrowth. His tone was slow, quiet,\neasy--the tone which, even if the words were not understood, would\nsoothe suspicious and abruptly alarmed minds. After another short\nsilence he resumed talking, pointing carelessly to the place behind him\nwhere stood the silent file of Mayorunas. A guttural voice replied. A\nhead peered cautiously from the edge of the bush, stared fixedly at\nTucu, and withdrew. The voice sounded again. Immediately three Indians\nstepped into view, poised for action. Another interval of staring, and\nthey relaxed.\n\n\"Come forward, comrades,\" said Louren\u00e7o. They came, halting again at the\njunction of the trails. Tucu spoke to one of the newcomers, who scowled\nas if only partly understanding, but grunted some sort of answer. Those\nbehind the Mayoruna leader craned their necks and scanned the Red Bone\nmen, who continued to eye with evident misgiving the tall-bonneted\ncannibals and the broad-hatted pair of whites.\n\nMan for man, these Red Bones were in every way inferior to the\nemissaries of Monitaya. Their bodies were more gaunt, their skins more\ncoppery, their foreheads lower, and their expressions much less\nintelligent. Furthermore, they wore not even the bark-cloth clouts which\nformed the sole body covering of the Mayorunas--they were totally naked.\nThe one point of similarity between the two tribes was that the faces of\nthe Red Bone men were streaked with red dye. But the facial design was\nmuch different: two short transverse stripes on the forehead, and three\nlines on each cheek, running from the eyes, the end of the nose, and the\ncorners of the mouth, straight back to the ears. Studying those visages,\nKnowlton and McKay recalled Schwandorf's statement that these people not\nonly ate human flesh, but tortured prisoners of war. It was easy to\nbelieve that he had told truth.\n\nMcKay, standing behind Pedro, shifted his position a bit. At once the\neyes of the three Red Bones widened and riveted on his face. Heretofore\nthey had seen only his hat and eyes, the rest being hidden from them by\nPedro's neck and an intervening palm tip. Now that they saw his\nblack-bearded jaw, they started slightly and peered intently at him.\n\n\"I think, Capitao, you would do well to shave,\" Pedro suggested, with a\nsmile.\n\n\"'Fraid so,\" the captain granted. \"Black beards evidently are _de trop_\nin the jungle social set at present.\"\n\nBut then one of the Red Bone men came forward, still squinting narrowly,\nand his expression was not hostile. In fact, it was more friendly than\nit had yet been. After a closer scrutiny, however, his face turned\nblank. Slowly he stepped back and muttered something to his companions.\n\nAt this Pedro's eyes narrowed speculatively. But his expression did not\nchange, and he said nothing.\n\nA lengthy conference took place between Louren\u00e7o and Tucu on the one\nhand and the three Red Bone tribesmen on the other; a difficult talk in\nwhich words and sign language both were used and frequently repeated.\nEventually an understanding was reached. The three stepped back, picked\nup some small game which they had dropped on beholding Louren\u00e7o,\nreturned, and led the way along the path. Louren\u00e7o cast aside his poke\nstick and resumed his usual place in the column. The whole line moved\nahead at a much smarter gait than before.\n\n\"Note--this path is not mined,\" thought Knowlton.\n\nThis proved true. Moreover, the way now was more broad and firm, so that\ntravel on it was much easier. After twenty minutes of rapid tramping it\ndebouched abruptly into a cleared space. Here all halted.\n\nBefore them lay a town of small, low huts, crowded closely together in\ntwo parallel rows which curved together at one end. The other end lay\nopen, giving access to a sizable creek whereon floated canoes. At the\nwater's edge, along the crude street studded with charred stumps, and\namong the damp-looking huts moved naked figures of men and women\noccupied with various sluggish activities. Some of the men already had\nspied the invading party and were standing at gaze.\n\n\"Comrades, we have reached the end of our trail,\" said Louren\u00e7o, running\na cool eye over the place. \"Now all we have to do is to find your Raposa\nand get him and ourselves away alive.\"\n\n\"That's all,\" Knowlton echoed, unsmiling. \"The reception committee is\nforming now.\" And with the words he unbuttoned his holster.\n\nA shrill yell had run along the double line of houses, and out into the\nstumpy street now swarmed men armed with hastily seized weapons. Hands\npointed, confused exclamations sounded, and a compact detachment of\nwarriors came jogging toward the newcomers. The three guides drew away\nfrom the Mayorunas. The latter promptly fitted arrows to their bows,\ninserted darts in their blowguns, lifted spears or clubs, and with eyes\nglittering awaited whatever might befall.\n\nA couple of rods away the Red Bones halted, bows ready. A hatchet-faced\nsavage who seemed to be in command rasped something at the three\nhunters, who quickened their pace toward him. Tucu strode out four paces\nbeyond his own men and stopped. Then both parties waited while the\nhunters reported what they knew to the hatchet-face.\n\n\"What did you tell them, Louren\u00e7o?\" asked McKay.\n\n\"That we came on a friendly visit to the chief, for whom we had\nimportant words.\"\n\n\"Nothing of the Raposa?\"\n\n\"No. They wasted much time arguing that we must tell them all our\nbusiness and let them inform the chief, while we were to stay back on\nthe path until permitted to enter the town. We told them our talk was\nfor the chief alone, and that we should come here whether they liked it\nor not. So, having no choice, they led us in.\"\n\nMcKay made no comment. None was necessary. Furthermore, his steady eyes\nhad caught a simultaneous head movement of the Red Bones--a peering\nmovement, as if all were seeking some one man among the new arrivals.\nPedro observed this. He spoke softly to Louren\u00e7o.\n\n\"Louren\u00e7o, tell Tucu to say to the Red Bones that we come led by a\nblack-bearded white man; that this blackboard comes from the far-off\ncountry where all men wear black beards; that the blackbeard will speak\nwith the chief only.\"\n\nThe Americans looked queerly at the young Brazilian, as did Louren\u00e7o\nhimself. But without question Louren\u00e7o obeyed. Calling to Tucu, he gave\nthe message. Tucu moved his head slightly, but gave no other sign of\nhaving heard.\n\n\"Now, Capitao, step forward a little and show yourself more clearly,\"\nprompted Pedro.\n\nWith another puzzled glance McKay did so. He saw that the brown eyes of\nthe younger man held a dancing gleam, but he could not read the thought\nbehind those eyes. Yet he noticed that as soon as he stepped out the Red\nBones all focused their gaze on him. More than that, the spokesman of\nthe three hunters pointed at him and said something to the\nsharp-featured leader.\n\nNow that leader came forward alone. Six feet from Tucu he halted again\nand talked in a growling tone. The Mayoruna leader, cool and dignified,\nmade answer. After a somewhat protracted exchange Tucu turned his head\nand motioned to Louren\u00e7o, who went forward, listened, replied shortly,\nand came back. Meanwhile the first detachment of Red Bones had been\nstrongly reinforced by others who had come up singly or in small\nparties. Now the expedition was outnumbered at least four to one by\nhard-faced, brute-mouthed, naked men ready, if not eager, for trouble.\n\n\"The Red Bone says we shall see the chief,\" Louren\u00e7o stated. \"At first\nhe said only you, Capitao, should go to him. Then he insisted that we\nall lay down our arms. Tucu has told him we lay down our arms for no man\nor men; that we come in peace--otherwise there would be many more of us;\nthat we leave in peace unless the Red Bones themselves bring on a fight.\nIn that case, though we are few, there lies behind us the power of\nMonitaya, and behind Monitaya the power of the Mayoruna chiefs, all\nstrong enough to wipe the Red Bone nation off the face of the ground.\"\n\n\"Strong stuff, that,\" said Knowlton.\n\n\"Strong, yes. But no stronger than is needed to impress these people.\nTucu intends to prevent trouble if he can; and often the best way to\nprevent trouble is to make the other man realize what may happen to him\nif he starts it. Also he has his orders from Monitaya to stay with us at\nall times, and he will follow that order even if you, Capitao, try to\nchange it. Now we go together to the chief.\"\n\nHe nodded to Tucu, who grunted to the Red Bone leader. The hatchet-face\nin turn shouted something to the men behind. Slowly they drew apart into\ntwo groups.\n\n\"You are the leader, Capitao,\" suggested Louren\u00e7o. Promptly McKay\nmarched forward, head up, eyes front, face bleak. The rest followed,\nTucu falling in behind McKay when the captain passed him. Preceded by\nthe Red Bone spokesman, the line advanced between the two bodies of\ncopper-skins and swung along the evil-smelling avenue to its upper end.\n\nThere, in the very center of the loop joining the two rows of huts, was\na house twice as big as any other. From its doorway the inhabitant of\nthat house could watch the whole life of the Red Bone town. Obviously it\nwas the home of the chief. At its door a pair of warriors stood guard,\nbut of the ruler himself there was no sign.\n\nTen paces from it the thin-featured leader stopped and motioned to McKay\nto halt. As the captain and the line behind him did so he stalked\nonward, passed through the doorway, and faded from sight in the dimness\nbeyond. With one accord the members of the visiting party looked around\nthem.\n\nThe street behind now was filled with the mass of Red Bone warriors who\nhad trooped after the column. All exit in that direction was blockaded.\nBut the ex-officers noted that between the houses were spaces each wide\nenough to hold a couple of men, and in an undertone McKay gave defensive\ninstructions to Louren\u00e7o.\n\n\"If fighting starts, have the Mayorunas take cover along these houses on\neach side. We who have guns will use the chief's house. We can sweep the\nwhole street from there. You two fellows capture the chief alive if\npossible. He'll be more useful as a hostage than as a corpse.\"\n\nPedro beamed approval of this swiftly formed plan. Louren\u00e7o muttered to\nTucu, who in turn passed the word down the line. Then all stood waiting.\n\nPresently the Red Bone man came out. He shouted a name. From the doorway\nnear at hand, where he had been standing and peering at the small but\nformidable body of newcomers, an old man now stepped forth and advanced,\nlimping a little, to the hatchet-face. The latter talked briefly to him,\nthen to Tucu. The Mayoruna leader pointed to Louren\u00e7o. The old man spoke\nto the Brazilian, who answered at once. Thereupon the wizened old fellow\nentered the chief's house.\n\n\"That old man speaks the Mayoruna tongue quite well, Capitao,\" said\nLouren\u00e7o. \"He says you and I shall enter and talk through his mouth with\nthe chief. All others remain outside, and we must leave our rifles\nhere.\"\n\n\"All right. Glad we can leave Tucu out here to control these fellows.\nHere, Merry.\" He passed his rifle to Knowlton. Pedro took Louren\u00e7o's\ngun. With packs still on their backs the chosen men proceeded to the\ndoorway and entered the house where waited the ruler of the Red Bone\ntribe.\n\nBehind them the line settled into easier postures of waiting. The Red\nBones, though so compactly ranged as to cut off any chance of escape,\nheld their distance, obviously neither inclined to fraternize nor ready\nto precipitate conflict by crowding. Thus, while keeping their ears open\nfor any sound of a concerted movement from behind, the visitors could\nuse their eyes to inspect the huts nearest them.\n\nIn some of these, women stood near the doorways, staring with unwinking\nabsorption at the light-skinned, athletic men outside who were so much\nbetter to look upon than their own mates. The Mayorunas returned the\nstares with the brief glances of men accustomed to noticing everything\nbut totally uninterested--as well they might be, for these poorly\nshaped, heavy-mouthed, mud-skinned females were not to be compared with\ntheir own women. Knowlton and Pedro, too, looked them over, but with the\nsame expression as if inspecting a family of lizards. Then they glanced\ninto other huts now empty of life, and in a couple of these they saw\nrigid red-hued objects hanging from the roofs.\n\n\"The red bones of the dead, senhor,\" Pedro muttered, and his blond\ncompanion, peering again at the sinister decorations, nodded without\nreply.\n\nVoices came to them from the chief's house, talking with droning\ndeliberation. Evidently no cause for friction had yet arisen. They let\ntheir eyes rove on beyond the guarded doorway, to pause at a house a\nshort distance away at the right. There stood a clubman, who leaned idly\non his weapon, but showed no intention of moving from his place. The\ndoor of that house was closed. Not only closed, but barred on the\noutside.\n\n\"Hm! Looks like a jail,\" said Knowlton. Pedro smiled, but an intent look\ncame into his face and he studied the closed house.\n\nSuddenly both started. At one corner of the house, unseen by the\nclubman, a head had cautiously slipped forth. For only an instant it\nhung there before dodging back out of sight. But both the watching men\nhad seen that the face, though half masked by long dark hair and a thick\nbeard, was much lighter than that of any Red Bone savage. And in the\nhair above one ear was a white streak.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nTHE RAPOSA\n\n\nMcKay and Louren\u00e7o, in a broad, low, musty-smelling room, faced a man\nwho stood and a man who sat. The man who stood was the old savage who\ncould talk in the Mayoruna language. The man who sat was the chief of\nthe Red Bones.\n\nIn his first words to the visitors the old interpreter revealed that the\nname of the Red Bone ruler was Umanuh. Later on Louren\u00e7o informed McKay\nthat in the Tupi _lengoa geral_ of the Amazonian Indians (which,\nhowever, was not spoken by this tribe) the word \"umanuh\" meant \"corpse.\"\nAnd whatever the name may have signified in the language of the Red\nBones, its Tupi definition fitted with disagreeable precision. For\nUmanuh was a living cadaver.\n\nGaunt, gray skinned, lank haired, hollow of cheek and eye, with thin,\ncruel lips so tight drawn that the teeth behind seemed to show through,\nribs projecting, clawlike hands resting on bony knees, his whole frame\nmotionless as that of a man long dead, the head man of the bone-dyeing\ntribe was the antithesis of both the piggish Suba and the herculean\nMonitaya. Only his eyes lived; and those eyes were cold and merciless as\nthose of a snake or a vulture. A man who ruled by ruthless cunning, who\nwould gaze unmoved on the most ghastly tortures, who would devour human\nflesh with ghoulish relish--such was the creature who sat in a red-dyed\nhammock and contemplated the impassive face of McKay.\n\n\"Umanuh, great chief, eater of his enemies, with fangs of the jaguar and\nwisdom of the great snake, awaits the greeting of the one-whose-hair\ngrows-from-his-mouth,\" droned the old mouthpiece of the chief.\n\n\"Makkay, leader of the fighting men of the Blackbeards, whose voice is\nthe thunder and whose hand spits lightning and death, gives greeting to\nUmanuh,\" responded Louren\u00e7o in a like droning tone.\n\nA pause. Umanuh gave no sign of life. McKay, straight and cold, met the\nunwinking stare of the chief with his own chill gray gaze. Between the\ntwo who spoke not was a testing of wills.\n\n\"Makkay brings with him none of the Blackbeard warriors,\" pointed out\nthe interpreter, who seemed to know his master's thought. \"He comes with\nonly the jungle men of light skins.\"\n\n\"Makkay needs none of his own warriors when he comes in peace. If he\ncame in war the terrible Blackbeards with him would cause the whole\nforest to fly apart in smoke and flame. Since he walks in peace to visit\nhis friend Umanuh, of whose wisdom he has heard, he brings only his\nfriends the Mayorunas, who are friends also to the men of the Red\nBones.\"\n\nAnother pause. The old man now seemed somewhat uncertain of himself. The\nsilent duel between McKay and Umanuh went on. At length the chief's eyes\nflickered a trifle. In a hissing whisper he said something.\n\n\"The men of the Mayorunas never come to this country unless seeking\nsomething,\" the interpreter promptly spoke up. \"What do they seek?\"\n\n\"Only that which Makkay seeks.\"\n\nThen, turning to the captain, the Brazilian added: \"Capitao, we now have\nreached the point to talk business. Have you any presents? And is it\nyour wish to give them now or later?\"\n\n\"I have a few things. But I'll give them later--if at all. This chief is\nhostile. Tell him what we're here for and see how he acts.\"\n\n\"It has come to the ears of Makkay,\" Louren\u00e7o informed the man of\nUmanuh, \"that a man of the Blackbeards lives among the men of the Red\nBones. Makkay would see that man.\"\n\nAgain the interpreter awaited his master's voice before answering.\n\n\"No man of the Blackbeards is among the men of Umanuh,\" he then denied.\n\n\"If he is not among them he is near them,\" was Louren\u00e7o's certain reply.\n\"He has been seen both by other Blackbeards and by the Mayorunas. I,\ntoo, have seen him. He bears on his bones the sign that his mind is out\nof his skull. His eyes are green and his hair touched with white. Umanuh\nand his men know well that I speak true.\"\n\nThe pause this time was longer than before.\n\n\"There was such a man, but he is gone.\"\n\n\"Then Makkay asks his friend Umanuh to find that one. A chief so wise\ncan easily find him where others would see only water and mud.\"\n\n\"If he could be found what would the great Blackbeard leader do with\nhim?\"\n\nLouren\u00e7o thought swiftly. To say the Raposa was McKay's friend would do\nlittle good. Friendship meant nothing to this unfeeling brute. Therefore\nthe bushman insinuated something which his cruel mind could comprehend.\n\n\"If a Red Bone man abandoned his people and went to another tribe, what\nwould Umanuh do to him when he was found?\"\n\nA cold glimmer in the chief's eyes showed that he thought he understood.\nMoreover, he would much like to see what sort of torture this hard-faced\nBlackbeard would use on a fugitive. It might be something even more\nfiendish than his own pastimes. So the next reply came promptly.\n\n\"If that man is found the blackbeard will pay for him?\"\n\n\"There are gifts of friendship for Umanuh,\" Louren\u00e7o nodded.\n\n\"The Blackbeard leader will pay more than the other Blackbeard?\"\n\nLouren\u00e7o almost blinked. What other Blackbeard? The Raposa himself? But\nthe Brazilian repressed his bewilderment.\n\n\"Makkay will first see the man to make sure he is the Blackbeard whom\nMakkay wants,\" he dodged. \"Then he will pay well.\"\n\n\"Umanuh will see the gifts now.\"\n\n\"The gifts cannot be shown now. They are packed away. When Makkay has\nlooked on the man Umanuh shall look on the gifts.\"\n\nAnother eye duel between the chief and McKay. As before, the captain's\neye proved the harder.\n\n\"Umanuh will think of the matter. Night comes. The man hunted by the\nBlackbeard is not here. The Blackbeard and his men may stay to-night\nacross the water. When the sun rises again Umanuh will talk further.\"\n\n\"It is well. Let Umanuh tell his men to stay on this side of the water,\nthat we may not mistake them in the night for enemies.\"\n\nWhen Umanuh had hissed assent the old man stepped to the doorway and\nsummoned the hatchet-faced warrior. To him instructions were given. He\nturned and carried the commands to the tribesmen.\n\n\"Makkay wishes Umanuh peaceful rest,\" said Louren\u00e7o. With which he\nflicked his eyes toward the door. McKay, with stiff stride, stalked out.\nLouren\u00e7o followed. Both felt the snake eyes of the cadaverous chief\ndwelling on their backs.\n\nTo the waiting Knowlton, Pedro, and Tucu it was briefly explained that\npreliminary negotiations had been concluded and that camp now would be\nmade on the farther side of the creek. Tucu, observing that the Red Bone\nmass behind was dividing again to let the visitors pass through, gave\nthe word to his men. The column began to move out, marching in reverse\norder. Pedro muttered swiftly to his partner.\n\n\"Louren\u00e7o, see that house with the barred door where the clubman stands\nguard. Remember where it is.\"\n\nThe other swept the loop in one quick glance, located the house, and\nfell into step without a word, the guarded structure fixed on his brain\nas clearly as if he had studied it for an hour. Walking down the\nmalodorous street, he said, quietly, \"There will be a small moon\nto-night.\"\n\n\"You are becoming a reader of the mind, comrade,\" Pedro grinned. No more\nwas said.\n\nDown to the shore of the creek trooped the party, followed closely by\nthe hatchet-face and a score of tribesmen. The whites and the Mayorunas\ngot into half a dozen of the waiting canoes and paddled across. In other\ndugouts the Red Bone men also crossed, but they did not land. As soon as\nthe borrowed boats were empty the tribesmen took them in tow and\nreturned to their own bank. The visitors were left on a partly cleared\nshore, separated from their uncordial hosts by some twenty yards of deep\nwater. Not one canoe was left them. Furthermore, the Red Bones now began\nactivities indicating an intention to establish a night-longwatch on the\nirside of the stream.\n\n\"Taking no chances of our raiding them to-night, or even snooping around\ntown,\" said Knowlton. \"Keeping everything in their own hands. Reckon\nwe'd better post sentries to-night, Rod, just to keep an eye on that\noutpost of theirs.\"\n\nMcKay nodded.\n\n\"We four will take it in turn,\" he agreed. \"Louren\u00e7o--Pedro--you--I.\nThree-hour tours.\"\n\n\"Pardon, Capitao,\" interposed Pedro. \"It would be well to change that.\nYou two senhores take the first two watches.\"\n\n\"Why?\" frowned McKay.\n\n\"Because Louren\u00e7o and I wish to go visiting. We are much smitten with\nthe charms of the ladies here.\"\n\nThe captain's frown deepened, but he studied Pedro's devil-may-care face\nkeenly before answering.\n\n\"Humph! What's up your sleeve? Out with it!\"\n\nPedro glanced around him and across the water. The tribesmen, both of\nthe Mayoruna force and of the Red Bones, were watching the colloquy.\n\n\"We are watched, Capitao. Let us make camp now and talk later. These men\ndo not understand our words, but we cannot tell what they may see in our\nfaces. Now speak harshly, as if I had been insolent.\"\n\nMcKay did. He thundered at the young bushman as if about to do him\nbodily injury.\n\nPedro retreated a step, as if taken aback by the storm he had unleashed.\nWhen McKay stopped he replied: \"Excellent, Capitao. Now I go to start\nwork on the _tambo_.\"\n\nHe trudged away with a sullen gait. On both sides of the stream the\nIndians muttered and looked at the tall commander with increased\nrespect. Truly, the Blackbeard was a fierce ruler and one who must not\nbe angered; he had the voice of a great gun and the temper of a jaguar.\nThat other man was lucky to have his head still on his shoulders!\n\nWhen the camp was made at the edge of the bush and the four comrades\nwere grouped in their hammocks, Louren\u00e7o narrated in detail the\nconversation with Umanuh. Knowlton reciprocated with news of what he and\nPedro had seen at the corner of the barred house.\n\n\"I almost jumped after him, Rod,\" he admitted. \"Had all I could do to\nhold myself. But I knew anything sudden like that might start war right\nthere, and we wouldn't have a Chinaman's chance of getting away with\nhim, so I stood fast. But he's here, and old Umanuh's a liar by the\nclock if he says otherwise.\"\n\n\"He is the same man we saw in the forest, Louren\u00e7o, or my eyes are\ntwisted,\" added Pedro.\n\n\"Hm! Something very fishy here,\" commented McKay.\n\n\"Very fishy indeed, Capitao,\" Louren\u00e7o echoed. \"The man is within call,\nyet Umanuh says he is not here. And Umanuh wants us to buy the man. What\nis more, he asks if we will pay more than the other Blackbeard. What\nother Blackbeard? The man himself has a dark beard, and since we left\nheadquarters Pedro and I have grown black whiskers, too. Yet Umanuh\ncannot mean the crazy man would pay him to stay here, or that either of\nus Brazilians would try to buy him. There are no other men with black\nbeards--except the German woman-stealer; and of course he cannot be the\none.\"\n\n\"No?\" Pedro asked, softly.\n\n\"No, certainly. Why? Of what were you thinking?\"\n\nPedro's brown eyes twinkled, but he made no answer. He only inhaled a\nlong puff from his cigarette and looked across the water at the\nhairpin-shaped town.\n\n\"What about that visiting trip of yours to-night?\" McKay asked.\n\n\"I wish to see what is in that house with the barred door, Capitao. When\nI am curious about such a matter Louren\u00e7o always becomes curious, too,\nso I shall have to take him with me. If I did not he would say I was\nmaking love to the chief's wives.\"\n\n\"_Por Deus!_ That may be all the barred house holds--the wives of the\nchief,\" guessed Louren\u00e7o. \"Why waste time and risk death to look into\nthat place?\"\n\n\"_Quem nao arrisca nao ganha_, as the coronel would say--he who risks\nnothing gains nothing. I feel that we should visit that house. Something\ncalls me back to it.\"\n\nLouren\u00e7o studied his partner a moment, then nodded slowly. But McKay\ninterposed decided objection.\n\n\"Too dangerous. Also unnecessary. We'll get Rand--if the man is\nRand--through the chief. Your night spying might ruin everything and get\nyou killed into the bargain. Nothing to gain and all to lose. Stay\nhere.\"\n\nPedro's eyes hardened. But it was Louren\u00e7o who answered.\n\n\"Capitao, I think we had best do as Pedro says. It is a queer thing and\nI cannot explain it, but I have known him to have such ideas in the past\nand they have always worked out for the best. He himself does not know\nwhy he does some things--things which look totally foolish and which\noften are very dangerous--except that he feels like doing them. Yet I\nhave never known this foolishness to fail to turn out well. He and I\nwill go over to-night and see what we may see.\"\n\nThe captain's brows drew together. Flat insubordination! Then he\nremembered that these men were not subordinates at all; remembered also\nwhat Coronel Nunes said concerning their ability to get into and out of\ndangerous situations. When Knowlton sided with them he capitulated.\n\n\"Up in the States we'd say Pedro was 'riding his hunch,'\" was the\nlieutenant's remark. \"And I've known a hunch to bring all kinds of good\nluck. Gee! I'd like to go across with you lads myself! But I'm no jungle\nexpert, especially after dark, and I'd only be in the way. Besides,\nwe'll sure have to stick here and keep up appearances while you're gone.\nHow will you get over? There's no way but swimming, and this creek's\nprobably inhabited by the usual 'gators and snakes and things.\"\n\n\"When one can travel only by swimming, one swims,\" Pedro smiled. \"Leave\nthat to us, senhores. Now the sun sinks fast and I have hunger. Let us\neat.\"\n\nNight was at hand. While the whites talked some of the Mayorunas had\nquietly slipped away into the bush, seeking whatever fresh meat might be\nobtainable without straying too far from camp. Naturally, the hunting\nwas poor so near an inhabited place, but now the absent men came\nstealing back with a few small birds and one monkey. Though the savages\nasked nothing and evidently expected nothing from the whites to eke out\nthis scant provision, the latter opened their meager larders to Tucu,\nordering him to see that every man had at least a few mouthfuls to eat.\nTucu, like a good commander, made no bones of accepting the invitation\nfor the good of his men. When all hands had stowed away the last meal of\nthe day the rations were reduced almost to the vanishing point.\n\n\"Those miserable whelps over there might have had the decency to give us\na few bites,\" Knowlton growled, looking at the Red Bone men on the other\nbank, who were gorging themselves on meat brought by their women.\n\n\"It is quite possible that they intend to give us several bites later\non,\" Pedro suggested, with a mirthless smile.\n\n\"Uh-huh. Shouldn't wonder. But it's also possible that they'll have to\nassimilate a few lead pills before chewing us up. Rod, we'll have our\nwork cut out standing guard to-night. I wouldn't put it past that lying\nold Umanuh to try rubbing us out before morning.\"\n\n\"Nor I,\" concurred McKay. \"Only question is whether he dares take a\nchance against our guns and against the likelihood that Monitaya will\nsend other men to investigate our disappearance. Better keep well out of\nsight.\"\n\nAs he spoke the last light of day vanished. Stars and a quarter moon\nleaped out in the swiftly darkening sky. The small fire of the\nexpedition threw dim shadows against the poles of the night shelters.\nLights glimmered in the Red Bone huts, and other lights began to streak\nacross the gloom--the bright little lanterns of fireflies coasting along\nthe stream. But at the point where the Red Bone night guard lurked no\nlight shone. They had built no fire, and now they were almost invisible\nin the faint moonshine--sinister shadows which even now might be\nmeditating murder or worse.\n\nLouren\u00e7o lounged over to Tucu, who was watching those shadows with a\nfixed cat stare, and informed him that until morning a man with a gun\nwould be always on guard while the rest slept. The Indian grunted\napproval. By way of precaution against being killed by his own men, the\nBrazilian added the information that later on he and his comrade would\nleave the camp and go upstream for a time. At this Tucu's eyes dwelt on\nhis, veered to the lights of the town, and returned. In them was a\nplain, though unspoken, question. The bushman ignored it and strolled\nback to his _tambo_.\n\nThe moon sailed higher. The animal uproar of early night began to\ndiminish. The fire, almost buried under slow-burning wood whose acrid\nsmoke alleviated the insect pests, smoldered dull red. McKay and\nKnowlton drew lots for the first sleep, the captain winning and promptly\ngetting under his net. In the Mayoruna shelter all was dark and silent,\neach man sleeping lightly with one hand on a weapon. The two Brazilians\nalso were out of sight in their hut.\n\nUp and down, a barely distinguishable figure, Knowlton passed slowly\nwith holster unbuttoned and rifle cocked, eyes turning periodically to\nthe Red Bone outpost and ears intent to pick any unusual sound out of\nthe night noise. Gradually the small lights of the town faded out. To\nall appearance, sleep had whelmed it for the night. The watchers on the\nfarther shore stirred a little at times, but the blot they made in the\nmoonshine remained fixed in the same spot. The only moving things were\nthe khaki-clad sentinel and the blazing fireflies.\n\nAnother hour rolled slowly by. The sentinel stopped and stood at a\ncorner of the _tambo_. Now was as good a time as any for the Brazilians\nto start their perilous reconnaissance. Perhaps they had gone to sleep.\nHe squinted at their hammocks. Yes, they were occupied. Stepping softly\nto the hammock of Pedro, he lifted the net to whisper to the occupant.\nThen he stared, dropped the net, and lifted Louren\u00e7o's curtain. A soft,\nself-derisive chuckle sounded in his throat as he stole out again.\n\nThe hammocks were occupied, yes; but only by packs and rifles. Armed\nonly with machetes, the two bushmen now were--where? He did not even\nknow when or which way they had gone. Fine sentinel, wasn't he, to let\ntwo full-grown men sneak away right under his nose? And if they could\nget out so slick, why couldn't somebody else--a murderous Red Bone, for\ninstance--get in with equal facility?\n\nWherefore he became all the more alert. Instead of resuming his slow\npace, he stood quiet at a corner, scrutinizing everything within his\nrange of vision, listening more intently than ever. Two or three times\nhe leaned forward and lifted his piece as some splashing noise in the\ncreek came to him; but each time the cannibal guards on the other bank\nalso sprang to see what caused the sound, then grunted to one another\nand relaxed, so he knew it was made by piscatory or reptilian life. Near\nhim nothing moved. And the moon sailed on westward, smoothly, steadily\nmeasuring off the silent hours of the night watch.\n\nThen all at once every nerve in him strained toward the back of the\n_tambo_. Something was there! He had not heard it--seen it--smelled\nit--but he felt it; a nameless thing that did not belong there. With\nsmooth speed he pivoted, looked, listened. Nothing there.\n\nMotionless, feeling slightly creepy, concealed under the roof corner, he\nwaited. A sound came--a stealthy sound. Something was creeping in.\nLouren\u00e7o and Pedro, perhaps? Stooping low, he peered along the ground\nunder the hammocks.\n\nA man was coming--coming on all-fours like an animal. He was too\nstealthy to be either of the Brazilians. Knowlton glimpsed him only\ndimly, but he was sure this was no man who belonged here. And now, as on\na previous occasion almost identical in its circumstances, the watchman\nacted in accordance with Tim Ryan's General Order Number Thirteen.\n\nIn three jumps he was upon the invader. His gun butt crashed down on the\nrising head. The other collapsed on the ground.\n\nSwiftly Knowlton snapped a match with his thumb-nail. The sudden flare\nhalf blinded him, but what he saw made him suck in his breath. When the\nmatch went out he turned the senseless body over, drew his pocket\nflashlight, stabbed its white ray downward. Then he committed the\nunpardonable sin of the army--he dropped his rifle.\n\nDark haired, dark bearded, streaked with red dye and bleeding slightly\nat the nose, at his feet lay the man for whom the indomitable trio had\ntraveled thousands of miles and dared all the deaths of the jungle--the\nRaposa.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nSHADOWS OF THE NIGHT\n\n\n\"Rod! Wake up!\"\n\nThe tense whisper aroused McKay instantly. With one sweep of the arm his\nnet was torn aside and he leaped out with pistol drawn.\n\n\"Right, Merry. What is it?\"\n\n\"We've got him! Look!\"\n\nThe electric ray again streaked the gloom. The astounded captain did not\ndrop his gun, but he came near it. For a long minute he stood as in a\ntrance. When he attempted to holster his weapon he fumbled three times\nfor the sheath before he found it.\n\n\"Whew!\" he breathed. \"Have you killed him?\"\n\n\"Nope--don't think so. Lord! I hope not! Now that I think of it, I did\ngive him a mighty solid smash. Used the butt. He was crawling in here,\nand naturally I didn't stop to ask for his card. Feel his head.\"\n\nMcKay complied. His exploring fingers found only a huge bump under the\nthick hair.\n\n\"No, his skull's whole. Didn't even split the scalp. You crowned him\nhard, but unless he got concussion he's still useful. His nosebleed\ncomes from hitting the ground, I think. Turn off the light. Are you\nstill on guard?\"\n\n\"Yes. The Brazilians are out.\"\n\n\"Take a turn and see that all's clear. Can't tell what might break any\nminute now. Leave your flash here.\"\n\nPassing the flat, nickel light-box to the captain, Knowlton retrieved\nhis gun from the ground and resumed his patrol. Slight as the\ndisturbance had been, uneasiness was in the air. The savages on the far\nshore were up, peering at the _tambo_ and muttering to one another.\nMeasuring the distance, the lieutenant saw that, though they had\nundoubtedly seen the flashlight switched on and off and made out the\nmovements of men, they could not have discerned what lay on the ground\nbeyond the hammocks. Nearer at hand, Tucu and a couple of the Mayorunas\nwere awake and looking out. But the sight of the sentinel strolling up\nand down in apparent unconcern and the absence of light in the _tambo_\ngradually quieted the suspicions on both sides of the water. Soon the\nRed Bones squatted again and the Mayorunas lay back with minds at ease.\n\nThen a dim sheen of light showed for a time at the back of the white\nmen's shelter, fading out after a few minutes into the usual gloom.\nMcKay had pulled a blanket over himself and the unconscious man, masking\nhis torch glare from any watching eye while he studied the face and form\nof the invader. After the faint radiance vanished certain sounds came to\nthe sentry's ears. Then McKay's tall figure loomed in the vague\nmoonshine. Knowlton stopped beside him.\n\n\"It's Rand,\" the captain vouchsafed in an undertone. \"No question of it.\nFeatures identical, though face is drawn. White hair mark, broken nose,\ngreen eyes. I opened one eye. Got a bad foot, partly healed; looks as if\nhe'd torn it on a stub. Poor devil seems nearly starved.\"\n\n\"So? Then that's why he sneaked in like that--wanted to steal some grub.\nThose mutts over yonder probably haven't fed him since he got hurt.\"\n\n\"That's it. He's had to do his own foraging, and his foot has given him\nmighty little chance. Damn those brutes!\"\n\n\"Right! But now what? Look out that he doesn't sneak away again.\"\n\n\"He won't. I tied his feet. He's in Pedro's hammock, still dead to the\nworld. If he wakes up and starts to yell I'll gag him. We've got to get\naway now as soon as we can.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Don't know. By water, perhaps. Wish those bushman were here. Haven't\nheard any noise over there, have you?\"\n\n\"All quiet. They're safe--or dead.\"\n\n\"Hm! Confounded foolishness, anyway. But we've no means of getting out\nuntil they're back. Couldn't desert them, besides. What time is it?\"\n\n\"Ten-thirty. You go on watch at midnight.\"\n\n\"I'm on watch now, inside. They may be back any time. If they don't show\nup in the next couple of hours I'll send Tucu to find out why. We'll\nhave to get those canoes over here, too. Water leaves no trail.\"\n\nHe turned back into the hut, leaving Knowlton figuring chances. To\nobtain those canoes was a man-sized job. To put the Red Bone guards out\nof action without arousing the whole tribe was an even bigger job. But\nno boats could be brought over until the outpost was silenced, that was\nsure.\n\nAnother half-hour crept past. Still no noise from the town, no\nsuspicious move on the other shore. Then from the _tambo_ itself came a\nlow mumble of voices. Knowlton stepped swiftly into it. As noiselessly\nas they had gone the two bushmen had returned.\n\nIn his usual concise phrases McKay was informing them of the capture of\nthe Raposa. With his back to the stream and the flashlight held close to\nhis body, he played the light for an instant on the face of the still\nunconscious man. Then, once more in darkness, he asserted:\n\n\"Now that we have him, we must get out of here. Only chance to do that\nis to get the canoes. With them we can at least be away from this town\nby sunrise, and it will take the Red Bones just so much longer to find\nour trail where we take to the bush. We'll get a flying start that way.\nAnything else to suggest?\"\n\n\"That is the best plan, Capitao,\" Louren\u00e7o agreed. For the first time\nsince the Americans had known him his voice held a note of suppressed\nexcitement. \"It is the only plan worth while. And I do not think we\nshall have to take to our legs soon--if at all. I believe this creek\nconnects with that which flows past the Monitaya _malocas_. We have\nlearned some things. _Por Deus!_ If only we had known the Raposa was\nhere!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because then we could have brought company with us. Senhores, guess\nwhat the barred house holds.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Women of the Mayorunas! Girls stolen from Monitaya and other\nsettlements!\"\n\n\"Jumping Judas!\" ejaculated Knowlton. \"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Sure, comrades! These foul Red Bones are the men who have been lurking\naround the Mayoruna tribe houses and capturing girls who went into the\nbush. They have taken the prisoners to the water, where the trails\nalways were lost and where they could find hiding places until night,\nthen drive their canoes past the clearings and get out of that country.\nSo there must be some water connection by which these men travel, and by\nwhich we too can travel. If we go downstream we are almost sure to find\nit by daylight.\"\n\n\"But why--what's the idea of their stealing the girls? For victims? If\nso, how are the girls still alive?\"\n\n\"Do you not see, senhor?\" Pedro broke in, impatiently. \"Did not Umanuh\nask if we would pay more than the other Blackbeard for the Raposa? What\nother Blackbeard?\"\n\n\"Schwandorf!\" the Americans blurted, simultaneously.\n\n\"Not so loud! Schwandorf, of course! Umanuh works with the German. He\ncatches girls by stealth and sells them to the German to add to his\nslave gangs. While the Mayorunas all blame the Peruvians for the\ndisappearances, Umanuh works unsuspected. He is holding these women\nuntil Schwandorf comes again--and it may be that Schwandorf is not far\noff at this moment. Now that we have come seeking the wild man, Umanuh\nat once thinks of selling him also; and he wonders whether we or\nSchwandorf will pay the more for him.\"\n\n\"By thunder! I believe you're right!\" Knowlton coincided. \"He's stalling\nfor time, holding us here while Schwandorf comes up, I'll bet. No wonder\nhe and his men are wary of the Mayorunas--they thought we'd come to\nsnoop around and catch 'em with the goods. You fellows must have done a\nmighty slick job to find out this stuff without getting caught. Isn't\nthe house guarded at night?\"\n\n\"Indeed it is! Two clubmen are there now, and there is only the one\ndoor. Not even a window. But Louren\u00e7o worked a small hole between two\nlogs at the back while I watched the clubmen, and through the hole he\nwhispered with one of the women inside. If only we had known the wild\nman was here we could have jumped the guards and tried to bring back the\nwomen. But of course your business about the Raposa had to be thought of\nfirst, so all we could do was to tell them friends were here.\"\n\nFor a few seconds there was the silence of thought. Then Knowlton\nchuckled.\n\n\"I'll say we have our hands full this night. Now we not only have to get\nourselves and Rand out of here, but also rescue the fair damsels from\nthe clutches of the ogre. 'Twon't do to leave them here while we go back\nto Monitaya and get the rest of his army. By the time we could come back\nthey'd be gone--one way or another. What's done has to be done now or\nnever.\"\n\n\"Right!\" McKay commended. \"We'll have to save the women, of course.\nQuestion is--how?\"\n\nLouren\u00e7o answered at once.\n\n\"My idea, Capitao, is this: We two will return. With us we will take\nTucu. The three of us can handle those guards quietly. We must have\nTucu, because the women do not know us and might balk at the last\nmoment. Women are queer creatures, and these might think themselves\nsafer inside prison walls than following two strange men through the\nnight; but Tucu can handle them. When once we are clear of the houses\nTucu can lead the women to the bank above here, and we shall try for the\ncanoes. Then it will be fast work to get away, but if we have good\nfortune it can be done.\"\n\n\"Confound it! You fellows are taking all the risks! Can't you take more\nmen--\"\n\n\"No. No man but Tucu. He has a cool head. These others, if they knew,\nwould go blood-mad and attack the Red Bones to avenge their lost women,\nand so would get us all killed. Now I will talk with Tucu.\"\n\nHe slipped into the Mayoruna shelter and returned with the cannibal\nleader, whom he led to the far side of the _tambo_ before speaking.\nThen, in whispers which the other tribesmen could not overhear, he\nexplained the situation. Knowlton took another turn or two along his\npost, finding that the Red Bones across the water were stirring about\nand evidently aware that something was going on; but they made no move\neither to get into a canoe or to send a man to the houses beyond. As he\nstopped again at the corner near the whispering pair he heard Tucu\ngrinding his teeth, and as the savage turned his face toward the Red\nBone outpost it was a mask of murder. But he spoke no word as he slipped\nback to his own men.\n\n\"He will wake another man and tell him what to do,\" Louren\u00e7o explained.\n\"But only we four shall know of the women until they are freed. Will one\nof you lend Tucu a machete? He may need a weapon, and he cannot carry\nhis big bow on this trip.\"\n\nA few minutes later the three crept out behind the _tambo_, Tucu\ngripping McKay's machete. As a final word Louren\u00e7o said: \"Our men here\nmay move about a little after a time, but do not try to keep them quiet.\nIt is a part of the plan.\"\n\nWith that he was gone. Listen as they might, the Americans could hear no\nsound to indicate that three men now were traversing the black tangle\nbeyond.\n\nMcKay took up his rifle and assumed the sentry work. Knowlton sat in his\nhammock, grateful for the chance to rest his weary legs. From the\nhammock where the Raposa lay no sound came. With a worried frown the\nlieutenant leaned over him and laid hand on his heart. After a while he\nsat up again in relief.\n\n\"Lord! I sure knocked him cold!\" was his thought. \"But he's still with\nus, and there's no use in reviving him now; the less noise over here the\nbetter. Hope I didn't jar his brains loose altogether; he might wake up\na murderous maniac. Poor devil! A millionaire, yet half starved and more\nthan half nutty.\"\n\nHe glanced at the dim scene before the hut. The moon now had journeyed\nso far westward that the creeping shadows of the tall trees had moved\nout almost to the creek, and the two crude shelters and the sentinel\nwere surrounded by dense gloom. The Red Bone men opposite must rely on\ntheir ears alone hereafter, for they could not see through this\ndarkness. McKay was visible enough to his own party, but not to the\nenemy. The blond man in the hammock watched the somber figure of his\ncomrade, followed the flight of a big firefly whose light floated near,\nthought of the two bushmen out in the dark, and looked again at the\nstill form of Rand.\n\n\"Drifters all,\" he soliloquized. \"The fireflies and Rod and Tim and I\nand those Brazilian dare-devils--all floating around because we can't\nkeep still, and never getting anywhere. And you, you silly-ass Rand,\nhave a mint waiting for you up home, and we have to come find you and\nlead you up there and shove your nose into it. And if you get your\nbrains back you'll be a nine days' wonder and a hero of the jungle and\nall that, and the girls will all tumble over you--because you've got a\ncouple of millions in your sock. And we fellows who yanked you out of\nhell by the left hind leg can pocket our pay and go jump off the dock,\nfor all anybody cares. Ho-hum! All the same, I'd rather be me than you,\nold thing. Free to drift and able to handle myself. You can have the\nmoney and the moths that hang around it.\"\n\nWith which he yawned, squinted again at the sinister figure squatting\nout yonder in the moonshine, arose, and made himself useful. Working\nvery quietly, he took down three of the hammocks, rolled them up, laid\nthem at the corner nearest the creek; made up the packs by sense of\ntouch and placed them and the rifles of the absent pair in the same\nplace. Then he lifted the Raposa from the one remaining hammock, laid\nhim on the packs, rolled up the hammock itself, and put it under the\nunconscious man's head. If given time when the crisis came, he meant to\nsave all equipment. If not, Rand lay where he could be grabbed without\ndelay.\n\nBefore he completed the work he became aware that the Mayorunas all were\nawake. Not only awake, but moving stealthily about, as Louren\u00e7o had\npredicted. McKay also knew it and stepped back into the hut, where\nKnowlton told him what he had done. But so softly did the men of\nMonitaya move that the Red Bone watchers showed no sign of alarm. Both\nthe Americans observed, however, that the cannibals across the stream\nhad their heads together and that occasionally one looked up at the\nlittle moon.\n\n\"Get that, Rod? They're waiting for the shadows to crawl over there and\ncover them and the water. They know that then we can't see what they're\nup to. I'm betting they intend to pull some dirty work after that.\"\n\n\"Yep. But intention and accomplishment are two different birds. Wonder\nwhat these Mayorunas are fixing to do. Wish I could talk their\nlanguage.\"\n\n\"Tucu evidently left orders for them to get up at a certain time, but\nwhy I don't know. We'd better let them alone.\"\n\nThe shadow line passed out upon the water, slipping by infinitesimal\ngradations across its mirror surface. The Mayorunas had become quiet.\nThe whites waited in silent suspense for they knew not what. Far out in\nthe forest a jaguar gave his coughing roar at intervals. Little by\nlittle the Red Bone men arose from their squat until they stood erect. A\ntense stillness held both forces. And the shadows crawled on--on--and\nreached the farther bank.\n\nThen a Red Bone man shoved his head forward, squinting upstream as if he\nhad heard something move in the rank grass. He began to sneak softly in\nthat direction. At that moment, from the water's edge a little above the\ncamp, sounded a loud hiss.\n\nBefore the sound died a sudden thrum of bow cords filled the air. A\nwhisper of five-foot shafts speeding over the water--a rapid-fire series\nof tiny impacts--a couple of short groans--the thumps of falling\nbodies--and the Red Bone outpost was no more. Shot through and through\nby the deadly war arrows of the Mayorunas, they were dead before they\nstruck the ground. And from the men of Monitaya sounded one short,\nsubdued \"Hah!\" of savage satisfaction.\n\nUp from the ground where that hiss had sounded rose a tall figure which\nwaved its arms and danced about in impromptu signals. Then it ran for\nthe canoes. Out from the gloom upstream other figures took shape,\nrunning fast for the same point. With one simultaneous movement Knowlton\nand McKay seized the Raposa and rushed with him to the stream.\n\n\"Senhores!\" sounded Pedro's voice, low but tense, across the water. \"Be\nready!\"\n\n\"Ready and waiting!\" snapped McKay. \"Who are those people. Your women?\"\n\n\"_Si._ We are not discovered--\"\n\nAcross his words smote a long shrill yell from the town.\n\n\"_Por Deus._ We _are_ discovered! Get our rifles, for the love of _Deus\nPadre_.\"\n\nHe leaped into a canoe, drove it headlong across, and dived for the\n_tambo_. Behind him the other figures dashed panting up to the landing.\nTucu's voice rasped in swift commands. The fugitives swarmed into other\ndugouts. The Mayoruna men, still ignorant of the identity of these\npeople, but assured by Tucu's voice and manner that they were not\nenemies, lowered their weapons and rushed for the water. Up in the town\nthe yelling swiftly grew into a roar, and running figures came pelting\ntoward the creek.\n\nThe canoes struck the bank. Some were partly filled, some empty and in\ntow. Into Pedro's canoe the whites bundled the Raposa, while the\nMayorunas got into anything within reach. Louren\u00e7o appeared from nowhere\nand urged the Americans to open fire. As he spoke, arrows thudded into\nthe ground and the water.\n\n\"Take this man and go!\" rasped McKay. \"We're losing our equipment,\nbut--\"\n\nHis rifle leaped to his shoulder. Flame spat from it. From the van of\nthe charging Red Bones shrilled a death scream.\n\nAgain and again the captain's gun cracked. Knowlton's joined in. Before\ntheir rifles grew silent the blunt roar of Pedro's repeater broke out.\nAnd with the emptying of their long guns the Americans drew their short\nones, and in a concerted ripping crash the forty-fives volleyed death\nand dismay into the oncoming cannibals.\n\nThe rush was checked. For a few seconds the Red Bones wavered and milled\nabout. Into their mass poured a cloud of arrows and blowgun darts from\nthe silent but no less deadly weapons of the Mayorunas. As the whites\npaused to reload, Pedro opened a new blast from Louren\u00e7o's rifle, which\nhis comrade had passed to him on the run. Louren\u00e7o was not shooting, but\nworking madly and alone to save the equipment. And, thanks to the\nrenewed deadly fire of the guns, he saved it.\n\nBefore the wicked belch of the three rifles and the two automatics the\nRed Bones gave back more and more. Their arrows plunged all around the\nfighting men, but they fell at random, for the gunmen and the canoes\nwere virtually invisible in the deep shadows. Downstream, Tucu's harsh\nvoice jarred in commands as he straightened out the line of boats.\n\nAt the next lull in the firing Louren\u00e7o panted: \"In, comrades! We are\nloaded. In!\"\n\n\"Great guns! Are you still here?\" snapped McKay. \"I told you--\"\n\n\"In! Talk later. Come!\"\n\nThe three gun fighters swiftly obeyed. With a powerful heave Louren\u00e7o\nsent the canoe after the others. Americans, Brazilians, and the Raposa\nhunched up among the packs, all went sliding down a jungle Styx.\n\nA moment later the Red Bone warriors, taking heart from the cessation of\nfiring, poured an avalanche of arrows into the spot where they had been.\nAnd as the canoe, last in the escaping line, was swallowed up in the\nimpenetrable blackness of the forest a hair-raising screech of\ndiabolical fury blended with a swift succession of splashes back where\nthe cannibals were plunging headlong into the stream to reach the dead\nor wounded men whom they vainly hoped to find on the farther shore.\n\n\"I told you to take this man and go!\" McKay fumed. \"By disobeying orders\nyou risked losing him.\"\n\n\"Oh, pipe down, Rod!\" remonstrated Knowlton. \"If they had, where'd we be\nnow? This was the last canoe.\"\n\n\"_Si._ It is so,\" added Louren\u00e7o, his voice hard edged. \"As it is, the\nman and the equipment and you also are here. And let me tell you this,\nCapitao Makkay, whether you like it or not: Pedro and I would see this\nwild man and a million others like him in a hotter place than this\nbefore we would abandon fighting comrades.\"\n\nTo which McKay, finding no adequate answer, made none whatever.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nTHE SIREN OF WAR\n\n\nLike a fleet manned by sightless sailors the line of boats blundered on\nthrough the blackness. With no guiding light, the canoes bumped the\nbanks and collided with one another in perilous confusion. Speed was\nimpossible, yet speed was imperative. Knowlton and his little flashlight\nsolved the problem.\n\n\"Say, fellows, let's take the lead,\" he suggested. \"This little light\nisn't much, but it's something, and there are some extra batteries in my\nhaversack when this burns out. We can see a little way ahead, and pass\nback the word to the rest. What say?\"\n\n\"_Na terra dos cegos quem tem um olho e rei_--in blindman's land he who\nhas one eye is king,\" said Pedro. \"That little white eye in your box may\nsave us all. Louren\u00e7o, tell those ahead to let us pass.\"\n\nWithout question the preceding dugouts swerved, and the boat of the\nwhite men slipped by. At the head of the line they found Tucu and his\ncrew struggling manfully to make progress without wrecking the whole\nfleet at the turns. Vast relief and instant acceptance of the new\nleadership followed Louren\u00e7o's explanation. At once the floating column\nbegan to pick up speed. And it was well that it did.\n\nHowls of baffled hate came faintly through the tree mass from the Red\nBone town. Some time later more yells of rage sounded, much nearer--back\nat a place on the creek which the last boat had cleared only a few\nminutes previously. Some of the Umanuh men had made torches and run\nalong one of the Red Bone trails to a bend in the stream, only to find\nthe water bare of everything but dying ripples.\n\nWhether the enemy attempted to follow in canoes the escaping party never\nknew, for none succeeded in overtaking the rearmost boat. And after that\none snarling uproar on the creek bank they heard no more of the land\npursuit. The narrow margin of safety gained by the aid of the flashlight\nproved enough to give a commanding lead, and from that time on the only\nobstacles to their retreat were those of darkness and winding waters.\n\nHour after hour Knowlton squatted in the extreme bow, picking out the\nturns and snags just ahead and passing the word back to Louren\u00e7o, who,\nin the stern, steered in accordance with his orders and relayed the\ncourse to Tucu, just behind. Amidships, Pedro and McKay plied steady\npaddles and the Raposa lay all but forgotten on the baggage. There were\nno halts. If any boat back in the blackness got into difficulties it\nextricated itself as best it could, unaided by the rest, and fell into a\nnew place in the column.\n\nAt last a wan light, which was scarcely a light, but rather a lessening\nof the density, came about the stream. The renewed racket of birds and\nbeasts announced that up overhead the sky had paled into dawn. Slowly\nthe nearest tree trunks began to take shape in the void, and presently\nthe shore line became visible to all eyes. At the same time Knowlton's\ntiny lamp dimmed and faded out.\n\n\"Another battery gone,\" he announced, opening the case and dropping its\ncontents into the creek. \"Ho-yo-ho-hum! Gee! I'm all in! Eyes feel like\na couple of burnt holes. Well, gents, I move that at the first available\nspot we go ashore, feed our faces, look at the ladies, and perform our\nmorning salute to Umanuh--said salute consisting of applying the right\nthumb to the end of the nose and snappily twiddling four fingers.\"\n\n\"Motion carried.\" McKay's set face relaxed. Then, his glance dropping to\nthe Raposa, it tightened again. \"Oh, hullo, Rand! How you feeling?\"\n\nThe unconscious man was unconscious no longer. Moreover, his expression\nwas not that of one just emerging from a stupor and bewildered as to his\nsurroundings. Though he had made no movement to change his position, his\neyes indicated that he had been awake for some time. They dwelt steadily\non McKay, then strayed past the captain to Pedro, Louren\u00e7o, and the\nfirst Mayoruna crew following a few feet behind. His face was\ninscrutable, and he spoke no word.\n\n\"You're with friends. Understand? Friends. You're going home. These\nIndians are friends, too. Get that? _Friends!_\"\n\nThe green eyes hung on McKay's face again; but, as before, no answer\ncame in word, movement, or expression.\n\n\"No good, Rod,\" said Knowlton, who could not see the rescued man's face,\nbut watched McKay's. \"'Fraid I knocked his last brains down his throat.\nDead from the neck up.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that. He doesn't look vacant. See here, Rand. We're\ngoing to land and eat! You hungry? Uh-huh. Thought you'd understand\nthat. He's alive, Merry. Maybe not all here, but enough to get us.\"\n\n\"Good!\"\n\nThe blond man turned his attention downstream again. Soon he suggested,\n\"How about landing at that little open space down there at the left,\nLouren\u00e7o?\"\n\n\"Very good, senhor. It looks dry.\"\n\nThe canoe swerved and floated down to a spot on the left shore where\nbright light poured down from an opening in the overhead wall of\nfoliage.\n\n\"Now look here, Rand,\" warned the captain. \"We'll untie you. But if you\ntry to duck into the bush, now or later, you get shot. Shot!\nUnderstand?\"\n\nHe tapped his pistol, and the gray eyes boring into the green ones were\nhard as chilled steel. For the first time Rand responded--a slow, short\nnod.\n\nMcKay cut the cord around the wild man's ankles, then stepped ashore and\nheld out a hand. Rand arose quietly, jumped to the earth unassisted,\nlifted his bad foot and stared at it, then limped onward into a spot\nwhere the sun now shone bright and warm, and sat down to bask.\n\n\"Have to fix that foot, I expect,\" yawned Knowlton. \"But my eyes right\nnow are one solid ache, and I'm going to rest them. Watch him, will you,\nRod? Can't tell what he might do. Of course you wouldn't shoot him,\nbut--\"\n\n\"Wouldn't I? Not to kill, no. But if he makes one break I'll drill a leg\nfor him. He's going to the States!\"\n\n\"Sure. I'm with you all the way. Now beat it and let me repose myself.\"\n\nHe bathed his eyes, then lay down in the canoe with a wet handkerchief\nacross them. Pedro and Louren\u00e7o already were ashore and raiding the\nslender packs for food. The Mayorunas were debarking and watching each\nnew boat as it drew up, their eyes on the women who had wielded paddles\nwith them but whose faces they now saw closely for the first time. In\nthe shaft of sunlight McKay stood tall and forbidding, rifle in the\ncrook of one arm, hat pulled low, guarding the gaunt man at his feet and\nviewing the landing of the expedition.\n\nThe women, all young, numbered eleven. Their skins looked slightly\npallid, their eyes too big and black, their faces somewhat drawn--the\nresults of close confinement and anxiety; but none showed any sign of\nabuse. For commercial reasons alone, Umanuh had seen to it that the\nwoman flesh he held for sale should remain uninjured. Now, saved from\nthe slave trail or worse, the girls showed no more emotion than if on a\nmere journey after turtles or fish. A few spoke to men whom they\nevidently knew. Others gathered in a dumb cluster and awaited whatever\nmight come next. With these Tucu talked in gruff monosyllables.\n\nWhen all were ashore, a dozen of the men went into the jungle to hunt.\nThe others sought firewood, inspected weapons, talked with one another\nand with the girls, who stared at McKay and asked who he was. A number\nof the warriors looked sourly at Rand, whose face still bore the Red\nBone tribal streaks which now, to Mayoruna minds, was the insignia of\nthe enemy. All knew he was the man who had been sought, all saw that he\nwas not a Red Bone, but a white man; yet their mental reaction to the\nsight of the sinister red cross on the forehead and the straight cheek\nlines was rabidly hostile. McKay, all-seeing, decided to wash Rand's\nface for him before journeying much farther. But Rand himself gave no\nsign that he either knew or cared what the feeling of the Mayorunas\nmight be. Utterly impassive, he stared back at them.\n\nThen one of the women pointed at him and said something to Tucu. The\ntall watchdog's jaw set a little harder as he waited the effect.\nSomewhat to his surprise, Tucu and a couple of the other men now gave\nRand a more friendly look. Soon afterward Tucu passed Louren\u00e7o, who\ntalked with him a few minutes. Catching the Brazilian's eye, the captain\nmotioned him nearer and asked for any news.\n\n\"Tucu says, Capitao, that most of these girls are from _malocas_ other\nthan that of Monitaya, though some of Monitaya's women also are here.\nAnd one of them says this man, the Raposa, tried to release them a short\ntime ago and was nearly killed by the Red Bones for it. They let him\nlive only because he is crazy, and they fear to kill a crazy man.\"\n\n\"What! He tried to get them clear?\"\n\n\"Yes. He opened the door and motioned for them to run, but before they\ncould escape they were caught. He was badly beaten. You will remember\nthat he was hiding behind that same house when Pedro and Senhor Knowlton\nsaw him. Perhaps he meant to try again.\"\n\n\"Hm! Crazy and wild, but a white man for all that. How did you manage to\nfree the women?\"\n\n\"Very simple,\" was the cool answer. \"We stabbed the guards, opened the\ndoor, and came back to the creek with the women.\"\n\n\"Just like that, eh? And the guards made no resistance, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Not much,\" grinned the bushman. \"They were not allowed to.\"\n\n\"I see. Very simple, as you say. About as simple as our calm and\nunhurried departure.\"\n\n\"Something like that, Capitao. What do you desire for breakfast--salt\nfish and coffee, or coffee and salt fish?\"\n\n\"A little of everything, thanks. Here comes some monkey meat, too.\"\n\nThe first of the hunters had returned, bringing two big red howlers.\nOthers drifted in at intervals, and not one returned empty handed; for\nhere in the virgin jungle the game was plentiful, particularly at this\nearly hour. Soon the air was heavy with the odor of broiling meat, and\nfrom the fire of the Brazilians the fragrance of coffee was wafted to\nthe nostrils of the recumbent Knowlton. He arose, swallowing fast.\n\n\"Gee! I'm half drowned!\" was his humorous complaint. \"The smell of eats\nmakes my mouth water so fast I have to gasp for air. Must tickle your\nnose, too, eh, Rand, old top?\"\n\nRand, famished though he was, gave no sign of assent or of hunger. In\nfact, he gave no sign of anything. Stoically he sat, eyes front.\n\n\"By thunder! the man's got pride!\" the lieutenant added, in a lower\ntone. \"Almost ready to keel over from lack of food, but stiff as a\ncigar-store Indian. Darned if I'm not beginning to respect him!\"\n\nTucu approached, carrying two big monkey haunches. One he offered to\nMcKay, the other to Rand. The latter's immobility vanished in a flash.\nWith a lightning grab he seized the proffered meat and sank his teeth in\nit. As he wolfed down the tough flesh the three men standing over\nexchanged glances. Tucu laid a hand on his stomach and pressed inward,\nsignifying that the man had long gone hungry. The others nodded. Then\nthey split the other haunch between them and fell to gnawing.\n\nLouren\u00e7o, bringing coffee to the captain, asked Tucu in what direction\nthe Monitaya houses lay. Without hesitation the Indian pointed off to\nthe left. The Brazilian glanced at the creek, estimating its general\ndirection and rate of flow, then returned to his fire.\n\nOffered coffee, Rand took it and sipped it with evident relish. Likewise\nhe accepted a cigarette, which he puffed like a man just learning to\nsmoke--or one who has not smoked for years. For his meat, his drink, and\nhis smoke he gave no indication of gratitude. His attitude was as\nindifferent and matter-of-fact as if he were one of the Mayorunas. When\nhis smoke was ended he began inspecting his bad foot.\n\n\"Let's see that,\" said Knowlton, dropping on one knee. \"Looks pretty\nsore. Yes, it's more than sore; it's infected. How'd you get it,\nanyway?\"\n\nNo answer. Knowlton probed his face keenly. Rand straightened out his\nlegs, wriggled his toes, and scowled.\n\n\"Queer!\" muttered the lieutenant, rising. \"He looks as if he actually\ndidn't know how he got that wound. You'd think he'd remember that much,\nanyhow. I sure am afraid his head is all scrambled up.\"\n\nHe went to the canoe, returned with his meager medical kit, and knelt\nagain.\n\n\"Now listen here, Rand. I don't know how well you understand me, but I'm\ntaking the chance. This foot has to be opened up and cleaned out.\nOtherwise you're going to have serious trouble with it. I'm going to\nhurt you. If you raise a row you'll get an an\u00e6sthetic--a swift punch\nunder the ear. Better sit still and make no fuss.\"\n\nWith which he went to work. He did a thorough job, and there was no\ndoubt that it hurt. But Rand gave no trouble, nor even a sign of\npain--except that he dug his fingers into the dirt.\n\n\"Good boy!\" the amateur surgeon approved, when he finished. \"You're a\nSpartan--if you happen to remember what that is. Now we'll move on. But\nbefore we go, wash your face good and hard. Get that tribe paint off.\nThese Indians with us don't like it. You're no Indian, anyhow; you're\nwhite, like us. Savvy? White man. Wash off paint!\"\n\nHe rolled up his kit and returned to the canoe. The Mayorunas, men and\nwomen, were entering their own craft. Rand sat motionless a moment,\nMcKay and the Brazilians watching him keenly. Slowly then he got up of\nhis own accord, limped to the water's edge, and began to scrub his face.\n\nWhen he desisted the marks still showed, for the red dye clung\nstubbornly to his skin; but they were fainter than before. The other men\neyed him thoughtfully, none speaking. He settled himself in his former\nplace, curled up, and began to doze.\n\n\"A queer fish!\" Pedro said, softly. \"Is he crazy or not?\"\n\n\"Hanged if I know,\" replied McKay. \"He's no maniac, anyhow. I'd give\nreal money to know just what his mental condition is. But we can forget\nhim for a while. I'm going to let you fellows sleep by turns now. I had\nsome sleep last night; you've had none at all. Merry, your eyes need\nrest. You curl up in the bow and snooze one hour. Then another man, and\nso on. And how about letting Tucu lead the parade again?\"\n\n\"Excellent, Capitao! I was thinking of that.\" Louren\u00e7o talked to Tucu,\nwho swung out into the current. The boat of the white men followed, then\nthe others. At a steady cruising speed the brigade surged on downstream.\n\nKnowlton's allotted hour passed. Pedro took his place and was instantly\nasleep. In turn he was aroused, and Louren\u00e7o laid down his paddle. But\njust then Tucu's canoe slowed and floated in to the left bank.\n\nThe others backed water and looked at a very narrow ravine--almost a\ncleft--in a rising hillside. Through it led a lane of water. From the\nthird boat, in which were two women of the Monitaya tribe, now came\nvoices carrying information to the Indian leader. At once he turned his\nboat into the cleft.\n\n\"This is the connection we have been seeking.\" Louren\u00e7o explained. \"The\nwomen say the boats of their captors came through this crack in the\nhill. At the end we shall find the creek of Monitaya.\"\n\nThe women spoke truth. After threading their way along the weedy\nwater-path, which was barely wide enough to give passage for the boats,\nthey emerged at a slant into another stream. Down this, with the sure\ninstinct for direction of the hereditary jungle-dweller, Tucu turned his\nprow without asking the women whether to go with or against the current.\nOnce more on the waters of their home creek, the Mayorunas quickened\ntheir strokes and howled merrily on toward their _malocas_.\n\nLouren\u00e7o took his nap and resumed his place. Hour after hour the fleet\nsped on. Noon passed without a halt, the paddlers munching at whatever\nfragments remained from breakfast. By turns the Americans and Brazilians\neach got another hour's sleep, McKay consenting to relax when all his\nmates had rested. Rand dozed and awoke at intervals, seeming content and\ncomfortable despite his cramped position.\n\nBy four o'clock even the Mayorunas began to lag in their strokes.\nExcluding the halt at sunrise, they now had been journeying for fifteen\nhours, in the last nine of which they had covered many miles of\nserpentine water. The heat of the day and the constant drive of the\npaddles had taken their toll, and now the body of every man fiercely\ndemanded more food. McKay, knowing that in jungle travel distance is not\na matter of miles, but of hours, had begun to figure that the journey\nwhich had taken nearly five days of overland work might be completed\nthat night by the swiftly moving canoes. But now, recognizing the signs\nof exhaustion, he realized that without some powerful spur the Indians\nwould not attempt to reach the home _malocas_ until the morrow.\n\nThen the spur came. Even as Tucu began scanning the shores for a good\ncamp site, he and every other Mayoruna suddenly ceased paddling and\nthrew up his head. Faint and far, a xylophonic call of beaten wooden\nbars rapped across the jungle, rising and falling in swift, regular\ncadence--a sirenical flow and ebb of sound waves. Over and over it\nundulated, rapid, incessant, imperative.\n\nA chorus of excited grunts broke from the canoe brigade. The dugout of\nTucu leaped away like a roweled horse. Louren\u00e7o and Pedro buried their\npaddles in mighty strokes, hurling their boat ahead to keep from being\nrun down by those behind.\n\nLouren\u00e7o barked at Tucu, who flung back an answer.\n\n\"Paddle hard, Capitao! If we do not keep up we shall be wrecked. That\nmessage is the war call of the Mayorunas--calling in the hunters from\nthe forest to take arms against an enemy. We must race now with these\nmadmen around us, or we go under. Paddle!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nSTRATEGY\n\n\nIn the last light of the fast-fading day the canoes darted from the\nforest into the clearing where stood the Monitaya _malocas_.\n\nLong before their arrival the siren call had ceased, but there had been\nno lessening of speed by the racing dugouts. On the contrary, the last\nlong mile had been covered in a final desperate spurt, the paddles\nswinging in swift unison to the accompaniment of a ferocious chant of\none syllable: \"Hough! Hough! Hough!\" This explosive cadence had echoed\ndown the stream ahead of them; and now, as the panting crews emerged\nfrom the jungle, they found themselves flanked by a long line of their\nfellow-warriors, bristling with drawn arrows and ready spear points. But\nof the enemy whose presence that great xylophone had betokened there was\nno sign.\n\nAt sight of the familiar feather bonnets of their own men the tense\nMonitayans let their weapons slowly sink. And when Tucu, leaping ashore,\ngaspingly demanded news of the fight, the line dissolved into a mob\nwhich rushed to welcome him and his mates. In the first few breaths it\nwas learned that no fight had yet taken place, but that all the warriors\nhad been brought in and ordered to prepare to march at the next sunrise;\nand that the sudden war call had been sent out as the result of the\narrival of a stranger.\n\nThen the crowd parted, and through it came striding two men whose\nappearance caused the white men to erupt into hoarse shouts of greeting.\nOne, whose hard face swiftly relaxed into a half smile of relief, was\nthe great chief himself. The other, whose jutting jaw suddenly dropped\nand whose blue eyes opened in incredulity, was Tim--Tim, once more\nstrong and florid and aggressive, gripping his rifle, astounded at the\nsight of his comrades standing there alive and alert. They soon learned\nwhy.\n\nDropping his gun, he sprang at them with an inarticulate roar of\nwelcome. He wrung their hands, pounded their shoulders, laughed, cried,\nswore, all at once. Then he burst out:\n\n\"Glory be! Ye're alive, homelier 'n ever and tough as tripe! We thought\nye was wiped out sure! We was all set to start in the mornin' and pull\nthem Red Bones to pieces. Mebbe we'll do it yet, too. How'd ye break\nthrough? Did ye kill Sworn-off and his gang?\"\n\n\"Schwandorf? Gang? Haven't seen anybody but Red Bones--though we sure\nsaw plenty of them,\" replied Knowlton. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"Then ye missed him by about one point windage. When'd ye leave? Last\nnight? I bet he's there by now. Gee! Where'd ye git them girls? And\nwho's this guy? Great gosh! Is he the Raposy? Wal, for the love o'\nMike--\"\n\n\"Tim!\" broke in McKay. \"What's all this about? Now wait. This is the\nRaposa. These girls are Mayoruna women held prisoners by the Red Bones.\nWe got them last night and lit out in the middle of a general\nengagement. Now open up with your news.\"\n\n\"Right, Cap. We got a visitor to-day--old friend of ourn--li'l' old\nHozy, the only white guy in that Peruvian crew we had. He's all dolled\nup like an Injun--shaved face, tribe paint, and so on. He come through\nthe Injun country that way--I dunno yet how he done it, him bein' a\nPeruvian and all, but he got through, and he says Sworn-off and a whole\ngang of bad eggs is back here to git this Raposy guy and all the girls\nthey can lay hands on. He says Sworn-off's got them Red Bones workin'\nfor him, and you fellers must be massacreed sure by now.\n\n\"Good thing I was here when he come, or he'd be cut up and in the\nstewpot. Monitaya's a good skate, but he sure is poison to anything\nPeruvian, and soon as Hozy begun to try to talk he got wise and dang\nnear bumped him off. I got him to cool down some, and he believes Hozy's\ntellin' the truth, but even at that they got Hozy tied up like a dog.\nCome look at him.\"\n\nBut it was necessary to wait awhile for Tucu and Louren\u00e7o to tell\nMonitaya the tale of what had taken place; for the chief demanded\nimmediate and full details, and not until he had them would he return to\nhis _maloca_ and his hammock throne. By that time the little moon was\nagain ruler of the sky and the keen hunger of the voyagers had grown\nravenous. Followed by the rescued and the rescuers, he then stalked into\nthe tribal house and to his usual place, where he commanded that food be\nbrought.\n\nOn the ground, directly in front of the chief's hammock, sat a gaunt,\npainted Indian around whose neck was a stout noose, the other end of the\ncord being held by a muscular savage whose skull-smashing club was\ngripped loosely in his other fist. As the whites reached them the noosed\nman's face cracked in a grin.\n\n\"Greetings, se\u00f1ores,\" said the voice of Jos\u00e9. \"You will pardon me for\nremaining seated, yes? The man behind me is itching for an excuse to\ncrush my head.\"\n\n\"Jos\u00e9!\" exclaimed both Knowlton and McKay. Though Tim had said Jos\u00e9 was\n\"tied like a dog,\" they had not thought to find the expression literal\ntruth. The sight angered them and they turned to Louren\u00e7o.\n\n\"Tell Monitaya we want this man freed!\" McKay snapped. At his peremptory\ntone the cannibal chieftain looked oddly at him, and when Louren\u00e7o\ntranslated the demand--though in a more diplomatic manner--he scowled.\nBut he gave the clubman the word and the rope was lifted from the\nprisoner's neck.\n\n\"_Gracias, amigos_,\" he bowed. \"If I still remain seated, it is because\nI am very weary--and I have not eaten since yesterday.\"\n\nHis thin face and his projecting ribs not only corroborated his simple\nannouncement, but indicated that for more than one day his food and rest\nhad been almost _nil_. Naked, painted, minus his fierce mustache and\nflamboyant headkerchief, he appeared a far different man than the\ndomineering _puntero_ of a short time back. But his bold black eyes, his\nreckless grin, and his mocking tone proved him the same swashbuckling\nJos\u00e9, undaunted by hunger, exhaustion, or his position as prisoner of\nman eaters whose enmity was implacable.\n\n\"Well, you're going to eat now, or we'll know why not!\" vowed Knowlton.\n\"We understand that you brought a warning to Monitaya. Is this his way\nof treating men who risk their lives to befriend him?\"\n\nJos\u00e9 shrugged.\n\n\"Once an enemy, always an enemy. That is their rule. And do not think\nthat I traveled the bush and threw myself into this snake heap from love\nof Monitaya. I do not care if he and all his race are blown to hell. I\nam here because, as I once told you, Jos\u00e9 Martinez never forgets. Thank\nyou, se\u00f1or, I will eat now and talk later.\"\n\nDeftly he extracted a chunk of meat from a clay pot which had been\nplaced before Knowlton and in turn tendered to him. Monitaya watched him\neat, but gave no sign of disapproval; and the Americans, and even the\nBrazilians, made an aggressive show of friendship toward the lone\nPeruvian for the express benefit of the chief. They knew well that by\ntheir rescue of the Mayoruna women they had made their own position\namong these people virtually impregnable, and that their recognition of\nJos\u00e9 as a friend probably would be his only bulwark. Wherefore they left\nno doubt in the minds of the watchers as to where he stood in their\nregard.\n\nMonitaya, sitting in regal dignity, looked down upon two parties of\nseven feasting with famished speed--the rescued women who were not\nmembers of his own tribe, and the four Americans, two Brazilians, and\none Peruvian. All the others had scattered--Tucu and his band to their\nown family triangles, and the four Monitaya girls to become the nuclei\nof feminine groups which demanded intimate accounts of their capture and\ntreatment by the captors.\n\nTo the strange women at his feet the chief paid scant attention now,\nthough he meant to interrogate them after their hunger was satisfied.\nHis eyes dwelt on Rand, the strange combination of white man, Indian,\nand jungle demon of whom he had heard so much and on whose tanned skin\nthe red skeleton streaks told the tale of a \"mind out of the skull.\"\nJos\u00e9 and Tim stared in frank curiosity at the dead-alive newcomer, whose\nsilent composure remained totally unperturbed. But the seven new girls,\nthough ignored by the chief and his guests, were by no means neglected\nby the other men of the _maloca_, being thoroughly stared at by most of\nthe young bucks--and, it must be confessed, by a goodly proportion of\nthe married men also.\n\nWhen at length the meal was finished Monitaya commanded the girls to\nstand before him and narrate their experiences. The men lit smokes, Jos\u00e9\nseizing the proffered cigarette with avidity, Rand accepting his with\nthe usual odd deliberation.\n\n\"Wal, Hozy, old feller, ye're in right with the chief now,\" asserted\nTim. \"Ye got all our gang with ye, and she's some li'l' old gang, I'll\ntell the world. This feller Renzo can talk cannibal so good he makes\nMonitaya hunt for the dictionary, and he'll tell the chief in ten\nseconds what I tried half an hour to say this afternoon--that ye belong.\nI 'ain't been here long enough to learn much o' their lingo, ye\nunderstand. If I could spout it like French, now, there wouldn't been no\ntrouble.\"\n\nMcKay and Knowlton snickered. They knew Tim's French was several degrees\nworse than the usual American doughboy's \"frog\" talk.\n\n\"Good thing you couldn't,\" derided Knowlton. \"You'd have had Jos\u00e9\ncrucified before we got here.\"\n\n\"That's right, gimme the razz! Course, I did have a li'l' trouble makin'\nsome o' them frogs understand, but that was because they was so ignorant\nthey didn't know their own language when they heard it spoke right.\nAnyways, ye got to admit Hozy's still with us and sassy as ever, and he\nwouldn't been if Timmy Ryan hadn't been round to powwow for him.\"\n\n\"You have it right, se\u00f1or,\" Jos\u00e9 agreed, gravely. \"Without you I should\nnow be dead. I can speak the Mayoruna tongue quite well, but of what use\nis it to talk any language when men will not listen? It was you and your\ngun that saved me.\"\n\n\"Gun? Good Lord! Did you pull a gun on Monitaya?\" ejaculated the\nlieutenant.\n\n\"Aw, no. That is--I guess mebbe I did wave me piece around while I was\narguin'--I can always convince a guy better if I got somethin' in me\nhand. But I didn't git real rough.\"\n\n\"You are lucky to be still alive, Senhor Tim,\" said Louren\u00e7o. \"If\nMonitaya were not the man he is you would not be alive. I am glad we\nhave returned.\"\n\n\"Meanin' I need a guardeen? Say, lookit here now--\"\n\n\"As you were!\" clipped McKay. \"We're all wasting time. Jos\u00e9, let's hear\nyour report. I thought you were going to put Schwandorf out of action\nfor good?\"\n\n\"And I am, Capitan! That is why I now am here. If I had reached him\nimmediately after leaving the Nunes place it would have been done at\nonce. But a man travels slowly when he is alone and has lost much blood,\nand before I met Schwandorf again I had time to think coolly. Then when\nI saw him I changed my plans.\n\n\"Some days down the river I met him traveling fast in a canoe paddled by\nhard men whom I know. He pretended to be greatly grieved when I told him\nyou all were dead. Oh yes, se\u00f1ores, I told him that! I was playing with\nhim, and it amused me to see how he thought he was deceiving me when I\nwas really fooling him. I said we were attacked by Indians a short way\nabove the Nunes place and that I alone escaped. Then he said something\nthat made me decide not to kill him for a time.\n\n\"He told me he had learned that this man here--his name is Rand,\nyes?--that the man Rand was a bank thief who had run away from North\nAmerica, and that a reward would be paid for him. He said your real\nreason for coming here was that you were detectives trying to earn the\nreward. That is false, is it not, se\u00f1ores?\"\n\n\"We're no detectives. Rand's no thief.\"\n\n\"Ah, so I thought. But Schwandorf often tells truth to conceal his lies,\nso that it is sometimes hard to know which is true and which untrue. He\nwent on to say he had warned you not to come into this Indian country,\nand he was sorry you had been killed--the snake--but since you were dead\nwe might get the money for ourselves. If we succeeded in catching the\nman Rand and taking him out alive I should get half the reward, or five\nhundred dollars.\n\n\"I saw plainly what his plan was. I might be useful to him in catching\nRand if Rand was out in the bush, for I have traveled this country alone\nmore than once and am a far better bushman than the German. But whether\nI got Rand or not, I never should live to demand my part of the money. I\nknow too much about Schwandorf--things which I shall not tell now. So\nwhen the right time should come, Jos\u00e9 would meet with a fatal accident,\nsuch as a bullet in the back, or a knife in the throat while sleeping.\nBut I did not let him know I saw this. I pretended to fall in with his\nplan like the fool he thought me to be.\n\n\"It was not Rand alone that brought him here. You have brought back\nMayoruna women from the Red Bone country, so you know the Red Bones are\nwomen stealers. And they steal for Schwandorf. You may believe me or\nnot, se\u00f1ores, but I did not know this until the German told me. Oh yes,\nI knew he dealt in women, but of the Red Bone part of his business I was\nignorant. As soon as I learned it I saw how I could put the illustrious\nSe\u00f1or Schwandorf out of action, as you say, and at the same time try to\nsave you.\n\n\"I sharpened my knife to a razor edge, deserted the German when we\nreached the right place, shaved with my knife, painted myself with the\nred and black plant dyes, and came overland to this place, thinking you\nwould be here if still alive. But you had traveled faster than I\nexpected and had gone into the Red Bone country, so my chance to save\nyou seemed to have passed. I could only try to tell this chief the Red\nBones were stealers of his women and that the German was with them,\nknowing that if he believed me he would go on the war trail against them\nand kill them all. But if Se\u00f1or Tim had not befriended me I should have\ndied too soon to tell my tale. That is all, se\u00f1ores. Now can you spare a\nlittle more tobacco?\"\n\nThey could and they promptly did. With a new cigarette glowing he lay\nback and looked quizzically at the women lined up before Monitaya.\n\n\"How many men has Schwandorf?\" asked McKay.\n\n\"About twenty in all, Capitan. There were eight in his crew, and they\nwere to meet a dozen more at a place on the Peruvian side.\"\n\n\"All riflemen?\"\n\n\"_Si._ He brought many cartridges for them. They are to raid tribe\nhouses of these people.\"\n\n\"Capture women and run them into Peru?\"\n\n\"_Si._\" Jos\u00e9 yawned as if speaking of a deal in salt fish.\n\nThe Americans looked thoughtfully around the big house. They saw that\nevery man near them was inspecting some kind of weapon--making sure that\nbow cords were unfrayed, that arrow heads and spear points were firm,\nthat the long blowguns had received no cast from suspension, and that\ndarts were absolutely straight and true. The strong but cruel faces of\nthe warriors were stamped with malignant hatred of the Red Bone tribe\nand the Blackbeard who enslaved their women. The command to prepare for\na march at dawn had not been withdrawn.\n\n\"We'll be expected to go, too, and I'd sure like another crack at\nUmanuh, not to mention the Schwandorf outfit,\" said Knowlton, \"but we\nhave friend Rand on our hands now, and our first duty is to get him out\nof here safely.\"\n\n\"Aw, Looey, have a heart! I 'ain't had no action since that li'l' scrap\ndown the river, and I got to have some excitement before we blow. What's\nmore, we can't beat it now, with Monitaya dependin' on us to fight on\nhis side. He'd git sore, and I don't blame him.\"\n\nHis superior officers and the Brazilians frowned. Every man of them\nitched to close with the enemy in one final decisive battle. Yet--\n\n\"What 'll we do with Rand?\" Knowlton voiced the general thought.\n\nThe green eyes of the Raposa turned to him, rested long on his, traveled\ndeliberately along the other faces. And then, to the utter astonishment\nof all, the dumb spoke.\n\n\"I'll fight,\" said Rand.\n\nSpeechless, the men around him stared. His face was inscrutable as ever,\nhis eyes fathomless, his voice flat and toneless. But slowly he raised\nhis hands as if holding a bow; twitched his right thumb and forefinger\nin the motion of loosing a shaft; let the hands sink. His gaze calmly\nlifted from theirs and dwelt on the farthest wall. Not another word did\nhe speak.\n\n\"Begorry! there's yer answer!\" triumphed Tim. \"He says, 'Fight!' And I\nbet he can sling a wicked bow and arrer, at that. Don't ye s'pose he\nwants a crack at them Red Bones, after the way they used him?\"\n\n\"I think, comrades, that the man has settled the matter for us,\" Pedro\nseconded. \"None of us wants to run away; and, as Tim says, we are\nexpected to help Monitaya. We should be considered cowards, worse than\ndogs, if we refused. If we do not fight the Red Bones we may have to\nfight these Mayorunas, who now are our friends. We must stay.\"\n\nMcKay nodded, still studying the expressionless countenance of Rand.\n\n\"That's settled,\" he announced, crisply. \"Now, Louren\u00e7o, find out\nMonitaya's plan of battle.\"\n\nThe chief had finished his examination of the women and Louren\u00e7o\npromptly put the question. Monitaya laconically replied.\n\n\"His purpose is not changed by our arrival, Capitao. He and his men go\nto-morrow to attack and destroy the Red Bones. When they reach the town\nof Umanuh they will surround it, and all will rush in when the chief\ngives his yell of war.\"\n\n\"About what I expected. An Indian has a single-track mind always. But\nhis strategy is rotten. Might be good enough if he had only Umanuh to\ndeal with, but with Schwandorf in the game it's different. Ask him how\nhe expects to protect his women while he's gone.\"\n\n\"He says,\" Louren\u00e7o reported, \"that there will be no danger to the\nwomen, because his warriors will be between the women and their enemies\nuntil those enemies are dead.\"\n\n\"Very simple. So simple that it's foolish. He doesn't figure on the\nother fellow's mind at all; doesn't realize that a man like Schwandorf\nis bound to outguess him on such straightaway tactics and isn't at all\nlikely to play into his hands. But that's the exact situation. The\nGerman will outguess him, and it's up to him to outguess the German in\nturn. We'll do his guessing for him.\n\n\"Schwandorf goes into Umanuh's town, learns what's happened, finds the\nRed Bones frothing at the mouth, and is sore himself. He figures that\nwe've returned here with the women, that Monitaya's men are blood-mad\nagainst the Red Bones, and that they'll do just what they are planning\nto do--march on Red Bone town and leave their women unprotected except\nby the old men, whose defensive power is negligible. He is in this\ncountry for the express purpose of getting girls, and with Monitaya's\nmen away from their _malocas_ he has a wide-open chance to make the\nbiggest slave haul of his life. So he plans to outmaneuver Monitaya,\nattack this place, capture all the young women, allow the Red Bones to\nmassacre everyone else and burn the houses, and then move on without the\nloss of a man. After that perhaps he intends to find us and get Rand, or\nperhaps to attack other Mayoruna _malocas_. At any rate, his first\nobjective is this place. Am I right so far?\"\n\n\"Dead right,\" Knowlton nodded.\n\n\"Very well. Now he may figure that, having found the water connection\nbetween the two creeks, the Mayorunas will come against Umanuh by the\ncanoe route. Or he may think they'll make the overland trip. In either\ncase, the Red Bones have to come through the bush, for the simple reason\nthat they haven't boats enough to carry all their force. Their canoes\nwere rather few when we were there, and we commandeered several of them\nfor our own use. If they decide to come part of the way in canoes\nthey'll have to work a come-and-go transport service, bringing the\nfighting men down in batches to some rendezvous from which they must\nfinish the journey on foot. Chances are that they'll disregard the\ncanoes and all march overland by some route that would dodge the\nMayoruna line of march. But in either case they're coming here. And it's\nhere, in the place where he's not expected to be, that Monitaya should\nmeet them. Let him fortify himself and await the assault. It will come.\"\n\n\"And we shall be saved many weary miles of leg work,\" Jos\u00e9 smiled.\n\"Capitan, your strategy is magnificent.\"\n\n\"Begorry! it ain't so bad at that!\" Tim approved. \"Hozy, me and you will\nhave our hammicks slung out front here when the show starts and do our\nshootin' prone. Suits me fine. Put it up to the chief, Renzo.\"\n\nLouren\u00e7o did. Very carefully he explained it all to Monitaya, dwelling\non the fact that McKay himself was a warrior chieftain and familiar with\nthe fighting methods of such men as the atrocious Blackbeard, and\ndepicting graphically the horror of an attack by the barbarous Red Bones\non the defenseless women. It took him some time to divert the chief's\nstubborn mind from the original plan, but in the end he succeeded.\n\nTo the vast astonishment and disappointment of the vengeful warriors,\nMonitaya curtly announced that the projected march would not take place.\nThey stared as if disbelieving their ears, and more than one black look\nwas given Louren\u00e7o. But not a man questioned the countermanding of\norders, not a mutter was heard. The great chief had spoken, and his word\nwas final.\n\nReluctantly they laid aside the weapons on which they had been toiling\nwith such purposeful zeal. The chief watched them with a little smile of\npride--pride in their zest for war, pride in their unquestioning\nacceptance of his dampening order. Then he coolly told them to continue\ntheir work; told them, further, that the next morning all the streams\nwere to be poisoned, new traps set, and scouts stationed far out on\nevery trail to await and report the approach of foes. Instantly their\nfaces flamed again and from every quarter of the wide house rose an\nexcited hum. They were to fight, after all!\n\n\"Tough eggs, these lads, if ye ask me,\" yawned Tim. \"Bet ye we'll see a\nrow worth lookin' at when she does break.\"\n\nHe forebore to mention the fact that in rifle power their assailants\nwould outnumber them four to one.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nTHE BATTLE OF THE TRIBES\n\n\nThe next four days, though they were days of waiting, were busy enough\nto satisfy the most impatient Mayoruna warrior.\n\nOutposts were established on every route by which the attacking force\nwould be likely to approach the twin _malocas_, the watchmen being given\nthe strictest commands not to fight, nor even to allow themselves to be\nseen, but to run at top speed with the warning.\n\nPoison detachments went forth to collect the ingredients for making\ndeadly the water and the weapons. Those detailed to the work of\npolluting the streams gathered quantities of blue-blossomed,\nshort-podded plants with yellow roots, the roots being pulped and thrown\ninto the slow currents, which straightway became fatal to man or beast\nThe wurali squad procured their favorite materials and, in a flimsy shed\nwell away from the houses, prepared a plentiful supply of the venomed\nbrew.\n\nNew traps were set at points where a man or two might be picked off,\nthough it was realized that these would have little effect on the final\nresult. And inside the big houses men especially skilled in the\nmanufacture of arrows and darts toiled swiftly and steadily from dawn\ntill far into the night.\n\nThese activities, however, were only the usual defensive preparations\nmade by the warriors whenever they knew a sizable body of foes was\nsomewhere in the vicinity. It remained for the brains of the white men\nto devise additional features, simple enough in themselves, but\nastounding to the savages, who were accustomed only to the primitive\nbattle tactics of their ancestors. For the first time in their lives the\ncannibals found themselves digging in--and also digging out.\n\nAfter a survey of the terrain and a catechism of Louren\u00e7o and Monitaya\nas to the usual methods of attack and defense, the two officers broached\nan idea born of the exigencies of the situation. As they expected, the\ngreat chief was somewhat slow to approve it, for it involved a literal\nundermining of the walls of his fortresses. But despite the natural\ninflexibility of his mental processes he was an unusually intelligent\nsavage, and eventually the patient reiteration of the advantages of the\nscheme won him first to assent and then almost to enthusiasm. Wherefore\nthe amazed tribesmen were set to work, armed with crude wooden shovels,\nin digging holes under the logs which sheltered them from man, beast,\nand jungle demon.\n\nAll along the walls, at intervals marked by McKay and Knowlton, the\ntunnels were dug. At the same time another large gang excavated before\neach of the _malocas_ a deep, curving trench, the two long pits being\nseparated by a ten-foot space of solid earth affording free passage from\nthe houses to the creek. Meanwhile the women and the older children were\nweaving flimsy covers from withes and vines. As soon as a tunnel was\ncompleted it was masked outside the walls by one of these covers, on\nwhich a thin layer of earth and grass was laid. The two trenches were\nlikewise concealed, and the loose earth was carried inside the house and\npacked solidly against the walls flanking the doors.\n\nAt sundown of the fourth day the work was ended. And so well was it done\nthat when the great chief, his subchiefs, and his foreign allies went on\na final tour of inspection they could find no sign that the houses were\nhoneycombed with exits or that the ground in front of the little\nentrances was not solid at all points.\n\n\"Rod and I took the idea from those pit traps out on the trails,\"\nKnowlton explained for the dozenth time. \"Holes are covered to look\nexactly like the rest of the ground. Every man of us has to be inside\nwhen the enemy arrives, but we have to get out quick when the right time\ncomes, so we go under the walls. And can't you see those brave women\nstealers go kerplunk down into the trenches? Oh boy!\"\n\nWhereat Louren\u00e7o and Jos\u00e9 smiled as if enjoying a secret joke. They\nwere. For they knew something of which the Americans were not\naware--that Monitaya had improved on the trench-trap idea of the whites\nby studding the bottom of those trenches with barbed araya bones smeared\nwith wurali.\n\n\"Yeah, and I figger them guys 'll git some jolt when these houses, which\n'ain't got nobody in 'em but women and kids, begin to spit lead out o'\nloopholes and spew screechin' cannibals up out o' the ground. Gosh! I\nwouldn't miss seein' Sworn-off's face for a keg o' beer--and that's\nsayin' somethin'.\"\n\nWherein Tim expressed the general sentiment.\n\nSo ended the fourth day. When the fifth broke no man showed himself\noutside the walls. Except the few outposts, every male of the Monitaya\n_malocas_ bided within, awaiting with growing tension the arrival of the\nenemy. It was more than likely, McKay had pointed out, that the main\nbody of the barbarous force led by Schwandorf would be preceded by a\nhandful of scouts, and quite possible that one or more of these would\nslip past the outguards and spy on the tribal houses. The sight of even\none warrior would instantly apprise any such spy that the others must be\nnear, and the word would go back at all speed to the Red Bones.\nWherefore the only Monitayans to pass through the tiny doorways that\nmorning were a few young women sent out as bait. These, naturally, took\ngood care to stay near the entrances.\n\nWithin, the men waited at their appointed places. Each tunnel had its\nquota of warriors, the number being divided evenly to assure a speedy\nand simultaneous exit. The Americans had elected to fight from the\n_maloca_ of the great chief, while the Brazilians and Jos\u00e9 were to\ngarrison the doorway of the other house as soon as the warning came.\nRand, wordless and imperturbable as ever, now was armed with a strong\nbow and plenty of new arrows with unpoisoned heads; and he, of course,\nwould remain with his own countrymen. Thus, preparations completed, all\nsettled themselves to the interminable hours of waiting.\n\nUp on the heaped earth near the doorway, which made the walls\npractically bullet-proof to a height of six feet and thus would protect\nthe women and children, one or more of the Americans was constantly on\nthe lookout through some inconspicuous loophole. Hour after hour dragged\npast, and no unusual movement or sound came to reward their vigilance.\nUnder the glare of the sun the roof and walls grew hot; under the silent\nstrain of endless anticipation the impatience of the fighting men became\na ferment. At length Pedro, unable to keep still, mounted to a peephole\nnear Knowlton. Scarcely had he put his eye to the opening when both men\nsucked in their breath.\n\nAt the edge of the bush a man's head peered from behind a tree. And at\nthe same moment a single canoe came creeping out of the bush and up to\nthe landing place. The head behind the tree was that of a Red Bone spy.\nThe two in the small canoe were Yuara and a companion from the Suba\ntribe.\n\n\"Louren\u00e7o!\" hoarsely whispered Pedro. \"Yuara comes. Tell girls to run to\nwelcome him and guide him between the pits. A spy is watching. If Yuara\nwalks on the pits he dies and our trap is revealed. _Por amor de Deus_,\nsend girls quickly!\"\n\nLouren\u00e7o acted instantly. Seizing two young women, he propelled them\ndoorward, talking swiftly the while. Yuara and his mate were already\nadvancing innocently toward the few girls outside, none of whom had wit\nenough to warn him. But the two whom the Brazilian had grasped happened\nto be of quick intelligence, and now they darted out. Before the\nvisiting pair could reach the death trap the girls were upon them,\nlaughing as if delighted to see a man once more, and deftly turning them\naside to the point where two unobtrusive stubs marked the bridge of\nsafety.\n\nVastly astonished by such effusive welcome from two girls whom they did\nnot know, but by no means displeased thereby, the young warriors of the\nSuba clan were piloted to the door and inside. As they disappeared, the\nhead of the spy also vanished.\n\n\"Woof!\" muttered Knowlton, wiping sweat from his brow. \"That was close!\nHere's hoping we have no more visitors.\"\n\nYuara and his companion meanwhile were being interrogated by both\nLouren\u00e7o and Monitaya, who in turn enlightened them as to the present\nstate of affairs. At the promise of war the faces of the Suba men lit\nup.\n\n\"Yuara comes only on a visit to learn news,\" Louren\u00e7o told the rest.\n\"You remember that the day after our return a canoe was sent downstream\nto a point where the wooden bars could be beaten and heard by Suba's\nmen, and that a warning against the Red Bones and Schwandorf was given\nin that way. Yuara has become anxious to know more, so he is here.\"\n\n\"If he sticks around he'll learn a lot,\" predicted Tim.\n\nWith no waste of words or motion Yuara coolly attached himself and his\nfellow-tribesman to McKay. Monitaya and his subchiefs were informed of\nthe arrival and departure of the enemy scout. The word passed among the\nwarriors, who, despite their innate equanimity, began to grit their\npointed teeth and quiver like dogs held in leash. But another hour\npassed, and yet another; and still no word from the outposts arrived.\n\nSuddenly a chorus of screams shrilled from the women outside. In a\nfrenzy of fear they plunged through the doorways. Blending with their\noutcries, a hoarse yell of ferocity rose raucously from the direction of\nthe creek. At once a louder ululation burst forth at the rear and sides\nof the clearing. Monitaya's outguards had failed and the _malocas_ were\nsurrounded.\n\nLoping from the bush fringing the stream came a score of yellow-faced,\nshirtless, barefooted brutes crisscrossed with cartridge belts and\ngripping rifles. At their head loomed a burly black-whiskered creature\nwith a revolver in each hand--the malignant Schwandorf himself.\n\nGrinning like a pack of yellow-fanged wolves, they doubled toward the\nlow entrances, their guns spouting wantonly at the upper walls--a ragged\nvolley meant to terrorize the defenseless women within, none of whom\nwere to be killed until the handsomest had been cut out and set aside\nfor slavery. Some of the heavy bullets bored through between logs and\nthudded wickedly into rafters and roof poles within. But from the\nloopholes where the defending rifles lurked no shot cracked in reply.\n\nThe fiendish howling of the Red Bones, sweeping in from all sides to the\nbutchery, swelled into a feline screech that almost drowned the roar of\nthe rifles. Into the view of the watchers at the loopholes streamed\nhideous faces and naked brown bodies swerving inward from left and right\nto follow at the heels of the Blackbeard and his gunmen. In a few\nseconds more the trotting line of Peruvians was backed and flanked by a\nhorde of demons hungering for the taste of women and babes. On they\ncame--\n\nWith the suddenness of a cataclysm the ground opened. Riflemen vanished\nin midstride. Savages screaming triumphant hate were gone in the flick\nof an eye. Others, instinctively digging their heels into the ground the\ninstant those ahead of them disappeared, were hurled forward and down by\nthe momentum of the following mass. Before the rush could be checked the\ntrenches were packed with men struggling in frenzy to get out, wounding\nthemselves and one another with the deadly points of their poisoned\nweapons.\n\nOf the twenty gunmen only four remained. They were the four immediately\nbehind Schwandorf. By blind chance the German had set foot on the narrow\nisthmus separating the twin trenches, saving himself and the henchmen at\nhis heels from being engulfed. Now, as the Red Bones fought back from\nthe trap yawning before them, he and the surviving Peruvians stood\nstaring in momentary stupefaction at the welter of death on their\nflanks. The malevolent yells of the savages had been cut short by the\ncatastrophe, and for the moment no sound was heard but the grunts and\nsnarls of struggling men.\n\nThen into the semisilence burst a mighty voice--the battlefield voice of\nMcKay.\n\n\"Now! Fire at will!\"\n\nThe walls spat flame and lead. A scythe of death swept above the ground\nwhere stood Schwandorf and his riflemen. The Peruvian half-breeds\ncollapsed and lay still. But Schwandorf, shocked into activity by the\nimpact of that first word, dodged death by an infinitesimal fraction of\na second. Hurling himself backward, he struck the earth just as the\nbullets sped through the air over him. With a lightning rebound he was\nup while fresh cartridges were jumping into the rifle barrels menacing\nhim. Headlong he dived into the mass of Red Bones just behind. And the\nnext bullets darting after him killed the savages, leaving him unharmed.\n\nThe command of McKay and the crack of the rifles sent the quivering\nMayorunas into the fight. In a flash every masking tunnel cover was\nthrown bodily into the air. Before the thunderstruck Red Bones had\nrecovered from the shock of finding their gun-armed leaders annihilated\nand their mass being swept by swift-shooting rifles hidden in the walls,\nthey beheld a horde of vindictive foes erupting from under those walls\nlike warrior ants rushing from subterranean galleries. A blood-chilling\nyell of concentrated fury smote their ears; a hastily loosed storm of\nwar arrows and short throwing-spears ripped into their flesh; a\nswift-running arc of light-skinned men swerved around them, shooting and\nstabbing as they went. They, who had so exultantly surrounded the homes\nof women and children, now were surrounded in turn.\n\nFrom the doorway of Monitaya's _maloca_ the two Brazilians and Jos\u00e9 now\nleaped forth and, firing as they ran, dashed to hold the entrance of the\nother big house. A few arrows whirred around them during their transit,\nbut the shafts were shot hurriedly and missed. Meanwhile the three\nbushmen were striking down enemies at every flash of their guns, firing\nwith the swift surety of veterans of many a running fight. They reached\ntheir objective unwounded; and when they reached it a fringe of dead\nfoes marked their passage along the face of the hostile array. Once\nwithin the door, they rapidly reloaded and sprayed lead along the\ntrenches, which, though now nearly full, had become a dead-line past\nwhich no Red Bone sought to go.\n\nUp on the earth embankments within the chief's house the four Americans\nfought steadily on; the soldiers shooting as coolly as if engaged merely\nin rapid-fire target practice, the silent Rand methodically driving\narrows in swift succession from his wall-slit. Arrows thudded thickly\ninto the logs masking them. Bullets, too, slammed into their\nrampart--bullets from the heavy revolvers of Schwandorf, who, ever\nkeeping himself protected by the bodies of his cannibal allies, shot\nwith both hands as the chance came. And the German could shoot. With\nonly the small gun muzzles as targets, he planted bullets so close as to\nknock dirt more than once into the eyes of the riflemen and render them\nmomentarily useless. After a time he got a bullet fair into a loophole.\n\nKnowlton grunted suddenly, swayed back, toppled, fell down the parapet.\nFor a few seconds he lay still.\n\n\"Looey!\" howled Tim. \"How ye fixed? Hurt bad?\"\n\nThe lieutenant heaved himself into a sitting position, stared around,\nclapped a hand to his right shoulder, looked at the red smear his palm\nbrought away, reeled up, and scrambled back to his rifle. Schwandorf's\nbullet had drilled clear through the shoulder, and in falling his head\nhad struck one of the upright poles. Without a word he got his gun into\naction once more, shooting now from the left shoulder. Tim, with a tight\ngrin of relief, devoted himself once more to trying to shoot down the\ndodging German.\n\nThe encircling Mayorunas, their first paroxysm of fury vented, now\nsettled in cold hate to their work. On all sides their clubmen and\nspearmen were bludgeoning and stabbing at the close-packed Red Bones,\nleaping in, killing, springing back and onward with terrible efficiency.\nBeyond these a thin but deadly line of bowmen poured arrows in\nhigh-looping curves over the heads of the hand-to-hand combatants, the\nshafts whizzing far up, turning, and plunging down unerringly into the\ncenter of the enemy force. Each of those arrows could, and many did, end\nthe lives of two or three adversaries by gouging their skins and letting\nthe fearful wurali into their blood. The blowgun men too were darting\ninto every opening, handling their clumsy weapons like feathers and\nconstantly moving to spy out fresh targets.\n\nBut the men of Monitaya were by no means escaping unscathed. The Red\nBones, assailed from every quarter and milling about in hopeless\ndisorder, were fighting now with desperate frenzy. Their own clubbers\nand stabbers were charging out and smashing skulls or piercing abdomens,\ntheir arrows rose in all directions at once, and some into whose veins\nthe wurali had struck sprang in the last moments of life on nearby foes\nand bit like mad dogs. With a leader and a chance to form into any sort\nof flying wedge they might have broken through with comparative ease and\ntaken a far heavier toll. But they had no leader: for Umanuh, whose name\nmeant \"corpse,\" now was a corpse in truth, his merciless brain oozing\nfrom a skull shattered by a Mayoruna clubman; and Schwandorf was very\nbusy looking out for Schwandorf. So it was every man for himself, with\nthe devil rapidly taking not only the hindmost, but the foremost as\nwell.\n\nThicker and thicker fell the dead. The trenches now not only were filled\nto the level of the ground, but piled with a windrow of bullet-torn\nbodies knocked down by the ever-spitting rifles. Jos\u00e9, Pedro, and\nLouren\u00e7o abandoned all shelter and knelt in plain sight before the door\nwhich they had kept clear of all close attack. Monitaya, until now a\nfield general who strode up and down roaring commands and encouragement,\nsuddenly cast away his regal role and, seizing a club from one of his\nbodyguard, hurled himself on the nearest Red Bones--a raving, ravening\ndemon of destructiveness whose glaring eyes smote terror into those\nfronting him and whose weapon swung like the club of Hercules. His\nbowmen and blowgun men, at last out of missiles, came charging in with\nbare hands or weapons seized from fallen warriors. Maneuvering had\nended. Henceforth the fight was a grappling m\u00eal\u00e9e.\n\nThen the gunfire dwindled and died. The rifle cartridges were spent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nTHE PASSING OF SCHWANDORF\n\n\nThe three soldiers flung down their hot, empty guns.\n\n\"Nothin' left but the gats and the steel,\" rumbled Tim. \"Me, I'm goin'\nout and git some fresh air.\"\n\nWith which he drew pistol and machete, leaped down, and lunged through\nthe door. McKay bounded at his heels.\n\n\"Merry! Rand! Stay here!\" he commanded. Then he was outside, his pistol\nroaring in unison with Tim's.\n\nKnowlton and Rand looked at each other. The lieutenant fumbled his\npistol from its holster, got it firmly in his left hand, slid down the\nembankment, and staggered out. Rand coolly walked over to Tim's\ndiscarded gun, picked it up, and followed.\n\nOver at the other doorway the bushmen threw aside their useless guns and\ndrew their machetes. Jos\u00e9, grinning like a death's-head, whirled the\nbush knife aloft and mockingly dared the Red Bones still fronting him to\ncome and take it from him. Pedro and Louren\u00e7o indulged in no such\nbravado, but leaped like jaguars at their foes. Whereupon Jos\u00e9,\nmuttering a curse on them for getting the jump on him, dashed forward\nwith furious abandon.\n\nTheir pistols emptied, the Americans also drew machetes--all except\nRand, who had no weapon but the bulletless rifle--and waited. Few\nunwounded Red Bones now were left; but among those few Schwandorf still\nlived.\n\n\"Schwandorf!\" bellowed McKay. \"You yellow cur--you _Schweinhund_! Come\nand fight!\"\n\n\"Yeah!\" taunted Tim. \"The women and kids are inside. Come and git 'em!\"\n\nSchwandorf came. He came not because he wanted to, however, for his\nguns, too, were empty. He came because the Red Bones, sensing the\nchallenge and loathing the Blackbeard who had shielded himself so long\namong them, threw him out bodily. They had no time to stand and watch\nwhat might happen to him, but they took time to cast him out where he\nmust stand on his own legs. Then, snarling, they resumed their now\nhopeless battle against their encompassing executioners.\n\nFor a moment the German stood glowering at McKay. Then, with a dramatic\ngesture, he threw aside his useless revolvers and advanced empty handed.\n\n\"Man to man?\" he growled.\n\n\"Man to man!\" echoed McKay, passing his pistol to Tim and sheathing his\nmachete. Fists clenched, he sprang forward.\n\nSchwandorf halted. His hands remained empty--until the captain was\nwithin eight feet of him. Then he leaped back, his machete jumped into\nhis fist, and its point stabbed for his antagonist's abdomen.\n\nAn instantaneous side-step and twist of the body saved the captain from\nevisceration. The blade ripped through breeches and shirt and scraped\nthe skin. As Schwandorf yanked it back for another thrust McKay struck\nit away with one hand and, without drawing his own steel, jumped again\nat his assailant. An instant later the two blackbeards were clenched in\na death grapple.\n\nSchwandorf found his long knife useless and dropped it. He strove for a\nback-breaking hold, but found it blocked. McKay, though an indifferent\nswordsman, was a formidable wrestler and fist fighter, and the German's\nadvantage in weight was more than offset by the American's quickness and\nwiry strength. Science was thrown to the winds. A heaving, choking,\nwrenching man-fight it was, stumbling over bodies, each straining every\nmuscle, trying every hold to twist and break the other and batter him\ndown to death.\n\nSmashing fist blows brought blood dripping from their faces.\nBone-wringing grips forced gasps from their lungs and superhuman spasms\nof resistance from their outraged nerve centers. They fell across a\ncorpse, rolled on the ground, throttled, kicked, struck, and tore.\nFinally, in a furious outburst of energy, the American fought his enemy\ndown under him, clamped his body with iron knees, and crashed a terrific\npunch squarely between the German's glaring eyes. Schwandorf went limp.\n\nAt that instant a backward eddy of the battle surged over the pair. The\nmaniacal Red Bones, fighting to the last bitter drop of doom, found two\nwhite men under their feet. Screeching, snarling, they fell on them like\nwild beasts, tearing with tooth and nail. Their arrows were gone, their\ndarts exhausted, and no spearman was among them; they fought with\nnature's weapons, while above them one lone clubman struggled to swing\ndown his lethal bludgeon without killing his fellows.\n\nMcKay, wrenching his machete loose and gripping it with both hands, got\nits point upward and jabbed blindly at the weight of flesh bearing him\ndown. Faintly to his ears came yells of rage and the impact of\nblows--the battle roars of Tim and Knowlton, who with their machetes\nwere cleaving a way to their captain. But the beastly demons over him\nstill crushed him down on Schwandorf, smothering him under the burden of\nbodies dead and alive. His stabs grew weak. Exhaustion and lack of air\nwere killing him more surely than the savages.\n\nPedro, Louren\u00e7o, Jos\u00e9 and the inexplicable Rand came slashing and\nclubbing a path of their own to the beleaguered Scot--the Brazilians\ncutting straight ahead with deadly surety, the painted Peruvian chopping\nand thrusting with a fixed grin, Rand swinging the gun butt down on head\nafter head. From still another direction Yuara and his satellite came\nboring in with spears snatched from dead hands. The three rescue parties\nreached the squirming heap at almost the same moment. But Yuara was the\none whose arrival counted most.\n\nIn one last convulsive struggle McKay heaved himself up until he was\nonce more on his knees. His head came out of the welter, his mouth wide\nand gulping for breath. The lone clubman grunted, swung his weapon high,\nand with all the power of his muscular body drove it down at that\nupturned, unprotected face.\n\nWith a mighty plunge Yuara threw himself over the captain. His spear\nsank into the stomach of the clubman. But the heavy wooden war hammer\nfell with crushing force. As the Red Bone collapsed with the spear head\nburied in his middle, his slayer also dropped under that terrible stroke\nwith head mangled beyond recognition.\n\nYuara, son of Rana, warrior of Suba, who owed his life to McKay's rough\nsurgery, had paid his debt.\n\nUnder the impact of his body McKay also slumped forward, senseless.\n\nOver them now burst the bloodiest berserk battle of that bloody day. The\nsoldiers, the bushmen, and the reclaimed Raposa, already smeared from\nhead to foot with red stains from their own veins and those of foemen,\nwent stark mad. Before their united ferocity the men of Umanuh dropped\nas if rolled under by an inexorable machine of war. Backward they\nreeled, striving now to escape the red wall of cold steel surging at\nthem--only to fall under a fresh attack of ravening Mayorunas who came\npouring in upon them from the sides. The last of the group lurched\nheadless to the ground under a decapitating side-swing from the awful\nclub of Monitaya himself.\n\nThen Knowlton, his lifeblood still draining slowly but surely away\nthrough his wounded shoulder, pitched on his face and was still.\n\n\"Back!\" gasped Tim. \"Git looey and cap out o' this! Here, you Raposy!\nLend a hand!\"\n\nThe Raposa, his green eyes ablaze and his obdurate calmness totally\ngone, glared around as if seeking one more Red Bone to kill. Then, as\nTim heaved the lieutenant across his shoulders and went lunging across\ncontorted bodies toward the _malocas_, he ran back to the heap where\nMcKay lay and dug him clear. Louren\u00e7o aided him in lifting the captain,\nand they bore him off after Knowlton.\n\nPedro and Jos\u00e9 shoved the other bodies aside until they uncovered the\nprone figure of Schwandorf--a ghastly form dyed from hair to heels with\nthe blood of the cannibals whom he had led there. To all appearances he\nwas dead. Yet the Brazilian and the Peruvian looked keenly at him, then\nat each other.\n\n\"There is a saying, is there not, that the devil takes care of his own?\"\ngrinned Jos\u00e9. \"It would be sad if this man should yet live and escape.\nSee! What is that tall Red Bone doing over yonder?\"\n\nPedro followed his pointing finger. He saw no such Red Bone as Jos\u00e9 had\nmentioned. But when he looked back at Schwandorf he noticed something\nthat made him glance quickly at Jos\u00e9 once more.\n\n\"Ah yes, Se\u00f1or Schwandorf is truly dead,\" the Peruvian added, wiping his\nmachete carelessly on one bare leg. \"Whether or not the devil takes care\nof his own, as I was saying, there is no doubt that _el Aleman_ now is\nwith the devil. So, since we can do nothing for him, let us look after\nthe two North American se\u00f1ores.\"\n\nPedro, with a grim smile, turned with him toward the tribal houses.\nThere was nothing else for them to do, for the Mayorunas now were\ndispatching the last survivors of the attacking force. Before the pair\nentered the low doorway a long, triumphant yell burst from the hoarse\nthroats of the men of Monitaya. Of all the Red Bones who had swept in\nsuch ghoulish glee into that clearing not one now remained alive.\n\nAt that shout of victory and the entrance of the men to whose\nprecautions and prowess they owed so much, the women flocked again into\nthe center of the _maloca_ and the children dived out through the\ntunnels to behold the battlefield. Though bullets and arrows had come\nthrough the doorway, those inside had escaped all injury by hugging the\nprotective earth embankment or taking refuge in the vacant shafts under\nthe walls. Now the older women, experienced in treatment of wounds,\nbusied themselves with the white warriors, while the younger ones\nfetched water and pieces of isca--a natural styptic made by ants--or\nmade up pads of poultices of healing herbs.\n\nTim, who had expected to play surgeon with his crude knowledge of first\naid, found himself not only relieved of his job, but being bathed and\nplastered with the others. He, Jos\u00e9, Pedro, Louren\u00e7o, and even Rand were\ngashed by thrusts from broken spear hafts, bleeding from open bites,\nripped by glancing sweeps of tooth-set clubs, bruised by fierce\nblows--minor injuries all, but such as might easily have resulted in\nblood poisoning unless given prompt attention. Later on they were to be\nthankful for those ministrations, but now they tolerated them only\nbecause they could do nothing for the captain and the lieutenant.\n\nMcKay and Knowlton were under the direct and capable treatment of the\nwives of the great chief. Of the two McKay looked by far the worse, but\nactually was in much better condition. From the waist up he was clawed,\nbitten, and bruised so badly that he was a fearsome spectacle; his left\narm was dislocated, three fingers of his right hand were broken, and his\nmuscles were so wrenched that for a week afterward he moved like a\ncripple; but his present unconsciousness was largely due to exhaustion\nand partial asphyxiation. Knowlton, whose skin was comparatively\nunmarked, but whose veins had continued to pour vital fluid from his\ngaping bullet wound during his stubborn fight, now was badly weakened.\nBut whatever could be done for him was being done, and the others could\nonly stand by.\n\nThe women not engaged in caring for the fighting visitors soon found\nthemselves busy with their own male relatives, who came stumbling in by\nthemselves or were carried by others. The Red Bones, though finally\nannihilated, had made their mark in the Mayoruna tribe. At that moment\nthirty-six of Monitaya's warriors lay dead among the bodies of their\nenemies, and before the next sunrise several more passed on to join the\nspirits of their comrades in arms. Yet all who survived, though some\nwere crippled for life, thought only of the victory and gloated on their\nscars of combat. As for those who had fallen, they were dead, had died\nas Mayorunas should, and so needed no sympathy or regret. Even now their\nbodies were being collected for immediate transportation into the\nforest, where, in accordance with the tribal custom, they would be\nburned.\n\nSome of the men who brought in the wounded men continued on to the\nbushmen and, in significant sign manual, requested a loan of their\nmachetes. Having received them, they hastened out to join those who,\nequipped with hardwood knives, were gathering the sinister trophies of\ntriumph before heaving the dead Red Bones out to the waiting vultures.\n\n\"Urrrgh!\" growled Tim. \"'Twas a lovely scrap, but I wisht I was\nsomewheres else, now it's over. While ye was away they brought in the\nfists and feet o' some guy they caught in a trap--\"\n\n\"We know,\" nodded Pedro.\n\n\"Yeah. Wal, I s'pose we got to look pleasant. Dog eat dog, as the feller\nsays. Long as somebody has to git et, I'm glad it ain't us.\" Wherewith\nhe turned to the Raposa and changed the subject. \"Raposy, old sport, ye\nsure done some good work, for a crazy guy. I'll tell the world ye\ncracked heads like a Bowery cop full o' bootleg booze.\"\n\nThe Raposa's green eyes glimmered. In fact, they almost twinkled. And\nfor the second time the wild man spoke.\n\n\"I am not crazy.\"\n\n\"Huh? My gosh! Ye spoke four whole words! That makes six in a week. Be\ncareful, feller, or ye'll strain yerself. And as far's bein' crazy's\nconcerned, don't let it worry ye none. We're all crazy, too, or we\nwouldn't be here.\"\n\nUnder cover of his banter the veteran eyed the other sharply. As he\nturned his gaze aside to the moving figures about him he thought:\n\"Begorry! he don't look like a nut, at that. Mebbe somethin's\nunscrambled his brains again. Here's hopin', anyways.\"\n\nThe big tribe house now was full of life. Small groups of warriors,\ntheir hurts dressed with primitive poultices, gathered around the\nhammocks of those more seriously injured and discussed the battle.\nOthers came in bearing armfuls of severed Red Bone hands and feet, which\nwere distributed among the family triangles. The women, their remedial\nwork done, now turned to the clay cooking vessels, freshened the fires,\nstripped the flesh of their enemies from the bones, and set it to boil.\nAmong the hammocks moved the subchiefs, their eyes still shining with\nthe light of battle, examining the wounded men and glancing at the\npreparations for the dire feast to come.\n\nOver all drifted a steadily thickening smoke which rolled up and out\nthrough the vent in the peak of the roof, where the setting sun smote it\nwith rays of gleaming red. Around the _maloca_ gleamed the red light of\nthe cooking fires among whose burning fagots bubbled the red pots and\npans. Red men and women passing about in a crimson setting--the scene\nformed a fitting end to the reddest day in the unwritten records of the\ntribe, who since noon had proved themselves worthy champions of the\nancient god whose name they never had heard, but who nevertheless ruled\ntheir lives--the red god Mars.\n\nMonitaya himself, head high and chest swelling with pride, now came\nstriding lithely in, followed by a young warrior carrying something. He\nstopped between the hammocks of McKay and Knowlton, studied their faces\ngravely, listened as his wives told of what had been done. At almost the\nsame moment the eyes of the pair slowly opened and stared up at him.\n\nThe face of the great chief melted in one of its transforming smiles.\nThe captain and the lieutenant grinned pluckily back. With a nod of\nsilent comradeship the big savage turned to his own hammock and sat\ndown. Two of his women built up the royal fire and fell to work on the\nthings handed over by the young warrior. Tim and his mates took one\nsquint at what they were doing. Then they moved between the fire and the\ntwo officers, blocking the view.\n\n\"'Bout time ye woke up and listened to the birdies,\" Tim chaffed.\n\"Fight's over, and we been hangin' round waitin' for ye to quit snorin'\nso's we could hear ourselves think. Lay still, now! Ye're all plastered\nup nice and comfy--and don't preach to me no more about the girls. Ye\nhad every dang one o' the big chief's wives hangin' over ye and kissin'\nye so hard it sounded like a machine gun. Ain't that right, fellers? Me,\nI'm so jealous I could bite the both of ye.\"\n\n\"Schwandorf dead?\" hoarsely queried McKay.\n\n\"Huh? Oh, him? Sure. Ye fixed him right, Cap. The pretty li'l'\nblackbirds has flew away with him by now. Say, ye mind that feller\nYuarry? Know what he done? Wal--\"\n\nAnd while he talked, behind his back the wives of Monitaya completed\ntheir task and dropped into the great chief's stewpot the flesh of the\nblack-bearded slaver and slayer who would menace them no more.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nPARTNERS\n\n\nSeven men squatted around a camp fire on the river bank. Beyond them,\nhalf revealed by the flickering light of the flames, rose the poles of a\n_tambo_ wherein empty hammocks hung waiting. At the edge of the water\nlay two canoes.\n\nFive of the men wore the habiliments of civilized beings, though their\nshirts and breeches were so tattered and stained that a civilized\ncommunity would have looked askance at them. The other two were nude as\nsavages, but their beards and tanned skins were those of white men.\nBeards of varying length seemed, in fact, to be the fashion, for\neveryone present wore one, and all but two were very dark. Of the odd\npair, one's thin face was partly covered by stubby, blond hair, while\nthe other's jaw was masked by a growth of unmistakable red.\n\nLifting their cigarettes, the blond man and a tall, eagle-faced comrade\nmoved their arms stiffly, as if still hampered by injuries. Newly healed\nscars showed on the skins of the rest.\n\n\"Injuns are a funny lot,\" declared the red-haired one. \"There's\nMonitaya, now. Keeps us a couple weeks, doctors us half to death, feeds\nus till we gag, gives us new canoes, sends a platoon o' hard guys with\nus to see that we git to the river safe--and don't even say good-by. No\nhandshake, no 'Good luck, fellers'--jest a grin like we was goin' to\nwalk round the house and come right back. And the lads that come out\nwith us done the same--turned round and quit us without a word. I bet if\nwe lived amongst 'em long we'd git to be dummies, too.\"\n\nFor a moment there was silence. For no apparent reason all glanced at\none of the naked men, on whose skin faintly showed reddish streaks.\n\n\"You would,\" he said.\n\n\"Huh! Gee! Rand's talkin' again! First time since we licked them Red\nBoneheads. Two whole words. Go easy, feller, easy!\"\n\n\"I will be easy. But it's time I talked. I am not dumb. I am not crazy.\"\n\nThe green-eyed man spoke slowly, as if forming each word in his mind\nbefore pronouncing it. The rest squatted with eyes riveted on his face.\n\n\"I have not talked before because I had to find myself. I had to hear\nEnglish spoken and become used to it. I had to put things together in my\nmind. Even now some things are not clear. But I can talk and make sense\nof my talk. I will tell what I can remember. First tell me one thing.\nMcKay, am I a murderer?\"\n\n\"A murderer? You? If you are we never heard of it.\"\n\n\"A man named Schmidt. Gustav Schmidt. German merchant at Manaos.\"\n\n\"Gustav Schmidt? Piggy little runt, bald and fat, with a scar across his\nchin?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"He's dead, but you didn't kill him. He was shot a little while ago by a\nyoung Brazilian for getting too intimate with the young fellow's wife.\nWe heard about it while we were in Manaos, and saw his picture. What\nabout him?\"\n\n\"I thought I killed him. I struck him with a bottle. I was told he was\ndead. How long have I been here?\"\n\n\"You left the States in 1915. It is now 1920.\"\n\n\"Five years? My God! What has happened in that time? Is my mother well?\"\n\nThe others looked pityingly at him. Slowly Knowlton spoke.\n\n\"Your mother died two years ago from heart trouble. Your uncle, Philip\nDawson, also is dead.\"\n\nRand's jaw set. The others shifted their gaze and busied themselves with\nmaking new cigarettes, spending much time over the simple task.\n\n\"Poor mother!\" Rand said, huskily. \"Uncle Phil--he was a good old scout.\nAnd I was here--buried alive--only half alive! My head--Tell me, what\nhappened on the night before you dressed my lame foot? I remember\nclearly everything from the time I woke in the canoe before daylight\nthat morning. Before that there is a blur.\"\n\nKnowlton sketched the events of that night, and told also of the glimpse\nwhich he and Pedro had caught of the \"wild man\" while waiting outside\nthe house of the Red Bone chief. A flash lit up Rand's face.\n\n\"So that is how I got my sore head. You struck me with your rifle butt.\nThat explains much. Before I became a wild beast I was shot in the head.\nThe bullet did not go through the skull. It struck me a terrible blow on\nthe crown. When I recovered consciousness I was not myself. I have never\nbeen the same until--\"\n\n\"Gee cripes!\" exploded Tim. \"That's it. I seen that same thing up home.\nBug Sullivan, it was. When he was a li'l' feller he tumbled downstairs\nand hit his head, and for 'most ten years he was foolish. Then a brick\nfell off a buildin' and landed on his bean. It knocked him for a gool,\nbut when he come out of it he was bright as a new dime. Looey, when ye\nbusted Rand with yer gun ye jarred somethin' loose inside, and now he's\ngood as any of us.\"\n\n\"By George! You're right!\" cried the lieutenant. \"Things like that do\nhappen. I've heard of them. Haven't you, Rod?\"\n\nMcKay nodded.\n\n\"That is it,\" affirmed the Raposa. \"I have not been insane. But much was\ngone from me. My mind was a house full of closed doors which I could not\nopen. I knew who I was and why I was here, but I knew also that\nsomething had happened to my brain; knew I was defective; believed I was\nwanted for murder. So I could not go out. I could only stay here, prowl\nthe jungle, live the jungle life.\n\n\"Now that the closed doors have opened again, others have swung shut. I\ncannot remember much of my wild-beast life here. Some things are clear.\nToo clear. Torturings and horrible feasts. Perhaps I should be grateful\nthat some things are forgotten.\n\n\"But now my life up to the time I was shot is plain again. I talked with\na man who had traveled the Amazon and the Andes. I never had seen\neither, and I was ripe for something new. A steamer was just sailing\nsouth, and I got aboard in a hurry. No baggage but a suitcase and five\nthousand dollars. I had traveled a good deal--Europe, Canada, Japan--and\nalways found that plenty of money was all a man needed. Thought it was\nthe same way here. I've learned better.\n\n\"I visited Rio--a few hours--and then came up along the coast and\ninland. At Manaos I got into trouble. Went ashore and got to drinking\nwith two Germans. One of them--Schmidt--grew ugly and said a lot of\nrotten things about the States. Tell me something, men--is the war over\nand did our country get into it?\"\n\n\"It is, and it did.\" And Knowlton outlined the epochal occurrences of\nthe world conflict.\n\n\"And I missed that, too!\" mourned Rand. \"But I started a war of my own\ndown here, anyway. When I quit seeing red I had a bottle neck in my hand\nand both the Germans were down. Somebody said Schmidt was dead. A couple\nof men tried to grab me. I fought my way clear, hid awhile, got back on\nthe boat without being noticed, and paid one of the crew well to hide me\nin the hold and feed me. Nearly died from heat and suffocation down\nthere, but lived to reach Iquitos, where my man smuggled me ashore. I\nthought I was safe there. But before I could make a move to travel on I\nfell into the hands of that cursed Schwandorf.\"\n\n\"Schwandorf!\"\n\n\"Schwandorf. He was in Iquitos. The sailor who hid me must have sold me\nout to him. Schwandorf told me he was a police officer in Brazilian\nemploy. Said he would take me back to stand trial for murdering Schmidt.\nThe dirty blackmailer took all my money to keep his mouth shut and take\nme to a 'safe place.' The safe place was up this river. I came up here\nwith him in a canoe paddled by some tough Peruvians. Then he began\ntrying to bully me into doing dirty work for him--running women into\nPeru. I saw red again and jumped for him. He gave me that bullet on the\nhead.\n\n\"After that things are badly blurred. I found myself among savages. How\nI got there, why I wasn't killed, I don't know. Schwandorf was there\nawhile. Then he went away with his gang, leaving me very sure of only\none thing--I was a murderer and would be executed if caught. And--well,\nthat's about all, except that the savages seemed rather afraid of me and\ndidn't want me around.\"\n\nThere was another silence. Then Louren\u00e7o remarked:\n\n\"Between Schmidt and Schwandorf you have suffered much. It is possible\nthat there was a connection of some sort between them. But neither can\never trouble you again. I do not see why Schwandorf took the trouble\neven to put you among the Red Bones. One more bullet would have ended\nyou.\"\n\n\"Any ideas on that subject, Jos\u00e9?\" asked McKay.\n\n\"Only a guess, Capitan. I was not here five years ago, and I knew\nnothing of Schwandorf then. But I know he always schemed for his own\ngood and overlooked no chances. So perhaps, finding this man not dead,\nbut darkened in mind by his bullet, he thought he might be able to use\nhim in some way at some future time. A dead man is not useful to anyone.\nIf this man should never become valuable he could live and die forgotten\namong savages, where he could do Schwandorf no harm. If worth something\nhe could be found again.\"\n\n\"Cold-blooded Prussian efficiency,\" nodded McKay. Then he spoke directly\nto Rand.\n\n\"Since you're mentally sound,\" he went on, \"we may as well tell you how\nyou happen to be among us. We three--Merry, Tim, and I--came here to\nfind you. The settlement of the Dawson estate hinges on you.\"\n\n\"On me? How? I've no claim to it. Paul Dawson, Uncle Phil's son--\"\n\n\"Is dead, too. Killed in action in the Argonne, You're next in line.\"\n\nMcKay watched him keenly. So did Knowlton. The half-expected jubilance\ndid not come.\n\n\"So Paul's gone,\" was Rand's reply. \"Hard luck. Suppose I hadn't been\nfound--then what?\"\n\n\"In due time the money would go to a school. Boys' school.\"\n\n\"Orphans? Blind? Cripples?\"\n\n\"Hardly.\" McKay's mouth curved sardonically. He named a preparatory\nschool of the \"exclusive\" type. Rand's mouth also twisted.\n\n\"That hotbed of snobbery? That twin sister to a society girls' finishing\nschool? Might have known it, though. Uncle Phil was fond of the sort of\neducation that doesn't educate. I'm glad you fellows found me. I'll go\nhome and collect every red cent, just to keep it out of the hands of the\nsupercilious bunch of bishops that run that sissy-spawner.\"\n\nKnowlton chuckled appreciatively.\n\n\"It's not the sort of school that breeds he-men, for a fact,\" he agreed.\n\"But you don't seem much enthused over having a couple of millions\ndropped into your lap.\"\n\nRand sat still. His face remained cheerless, impassive.\n\n\"What is money?\" he said, presently. \"I've always had plenty of it.\nWhat's it done for me? When you have it you can't tell whether people\nare friends to you or only friends to your money. It makes you cynical,\nsuspicious. What's worse, you depend too much on it. You think it will\ndo everything. Then if you land in a place where it's no good and you\nhaven't got it, anyway, you're up against it a good deal harder than the\nfellow who never had it but knows how to handle himself without it.\"\n\n\"True for ye,\" Tim concurred, heartily. \"All the same, I bet ye'll\nchange yer tune after ye git home.\"\n\n\"Will I?\" The green eyes impaled him. \"Maybe. But I don't think so. I've\nhad my run at blowing in money on myself alone. Now I'm going to blow\nsome on other folks. I missed out on the war, but--There must be quite a\nfew of our fellows lamed and crippled by that war. And I'll gamble that\nthe government isn't treating them all like princes. I know something\nabout governments.\"\n\n\"Princes? Say, feller, there's many a dog that's took better care of\nthan some of our boys back home!\"\n\n\"So I thought. The income from a couple of millions, along with some of\nthe principal, will do a lot of good if used right. And--\" His eyes\nturned to the three bushmen.\n\n\"Do not look at us in that way,\" said Louren\u00e7o, reading his thought. \"We\ncan make all the money we need, and we came with the capitao and his\ncomrades only because we wanted excitement. Use your money for the\ncrippled men who need it.\"\n\n\"And Jos\u00e9 Martinez also is well able to provide for his wants,\" coolly\nadded the other naked man. \"I am here only to settle old scores, and now\nthey are settled. Each man is goaded by his own spur--money, wine,\nwomen, excitement, revenge. Money is not mine.\"\n\nHe yawned, arose, stretched like a cat, and stepped toward his hammock.\nThe two Brasilians also moved toward the _tambo_. The others stood a\nmoment longer beside the fire.\n\n\"Well, since we three didn't come here because of wine, women, or\nrevenge,\" Knowlton said, whimsically, \"it must have been for money and\nexcitement. Don't know which was the stronger lure, but if we could have\nonly one of the two I think we'd let the money slide. How about it,\nRod?\"\n\n\"Right! And, Rand, let me say this: Before we knew you we had an\nimpression that you were more or less of a worthless pup. We've changed\nour ideas. If you ever go broke and want to hit a trail into some new\nplace to make a strike of your own, and you need partners, let us know.\"\n\nAnd he held out his hand.\n\nThe naked millionaire took it. For the first time a faint smile\nlightened his face.\n\n\"I'll do that, partners!\" he promised.\n\n\"Yeah! That's the word. Pardners! Only, li'l' Timmy Ryan bucks at ever\ntravelin' back into this here, now, Ja-va-ree jungle. I got enough of\nit. Right now I'm homesick.\"\n\n\"So say we all,\" affirmed Knowlton. \"Now let's turn in.\"\n\nBut Tim stood a little longer looking out at the moonlit river and the\ntwo waiting canoes. His gaze roved along the stream, northward. He\nlifted his head, opened his mouth, expanded his lungs, and then the\nastounded denizens of forest and stream cut short their discordant\nconcert to listen to something they never had heard before and never\nwould hear again--a great voice thundering a censored version of a North\nAmerican army song.\n\n    \"Home, boys, home! Home we want to be!\n    Home, boys, home, in God's countree!\n    We'll raise Ol' Glory to the top o' the pole\n    And we'll all come back--not a dog-gone soul!\"\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE PATHLESS TRAIL***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 30324-8.txt or 30324-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/3/0/3/2/30324\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://www.gutenberg.org/about/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
