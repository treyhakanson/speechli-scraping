Rider Haggard\n\n\n     \"Here ends this history so far as it concerns science and the\n     outside world. What its end will be as regards Leo and myself is\n     more than I can guess. But we feel that it is not reached. . . .\n     Often I sit alone at night, staring with the eyes of my mind into\n     the blackness of unborn time, and wondering in what shape and form\n     the great drama will be finally developed, and where the scene of\n     its next act will be laid. And when, ultimately, that _final_\n     development occurs, as I have no doubt it must and will occur, in\n     obedience to a fate that never swerves and a purpose which cannot\n     be altered, what will be the part played therein by that beautiful\n     Egyptian Amenar-tas, the Princess of the royal house of the\n     Pharaohs, for the love of whom the priest Kallikrates broke his\n     vows to Isis, and, pursued by the vengeance of the outraged\n     goddess, fled down the coast of Lybia to meet his doom at Kor?\"--\n     _She_, Silver Library Edition, p. 277.\n\n\nDEDICATION\n\nMy dear Lang,\n\nThe appointed years--alas! how many of them--are gone by, leaving Ayesha\nlovely and loving and ourselves alive. As it was promised in the Caves\nof Kor _She_ has returned again.\n\nTo you therefore who accepted the first, I offer this further history of\none of the various incarnations of that Immortal.\n\nMy hope is that after you have read her record, notwithstanding her\nsubtleties and sins and the shortcomings of her chronicler (no easy\noffice!) you may continue to wear your chain of \"loyalty to our lady\nAyesha.\" Such, I confess, is still the fate of your old friend\n\nH. RIDER HAGGARD.\n\nDITCHINGHAM, 1905.\n\n\n\n\nAUTHOR'S NOTE\n\nNot with a view of conciliating those readers who on principle object to\nsequels, but as a matter of fact, the Author wishes to say that he does\nnot so regard this book.\n\nRather does he venture to ask that it should be considered as the\nconclusion of an imaginative tragedy (if he may so call it) whereof one\nhalf has been already published.\n\nThis conclusion it was always his desire to write should he be destined\nto live through those many years which, in obedience to his original\ndesign, must be allowed to lapse between the events of the first and\nsecond parts of the romance.\n\nIn response to many enquiries he may add that the name Ayesha, which\nsince the days of the prophet Mahomet, who had a wife so called, and\nperhaps before them, has been common in the East, should be pronounced\n_Assha_.\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nVerily and indeed it is the unexpected that happens! Probably if there\nwas one person upon the earth from whom the Editor of this, and of a\ncertain previous history, did not expect to hear again, that person was\nLudwig Horace Holly. This, too, for a good reason; he believed him to\nhave taken his departure from the earth.\n\nWhen Mr. Holly last wrote, many, many years ago, it was to transmit the\nmanuscript of _She_, and to announce that he and his ward, Leo Vincey,\nthe beloved of the divine Ayesha, were about to travel to Central Asia\nin the hope, I suppose, that there she would fulfil her promise and\nappear to them again.\n\nOften I have wondered, idly enough, what happened to them there; whether\nthey were dead, or perhaps droning their lives away as monks in some\nThibetan Lamasery, or studying magic and practising asceticism under\nthe tuition of the Eastern Masters trusting that thus they would build a\nbridge by which they might pass to the side of their adored Immortal.\n\nNow at length, when I had not thought of them for months, without a\nsingle warning sign, out of the blue as it were, comes the answer to\nthese wonderings!\n\nTo think--only to think--that I, the Editor aforesaid, from its\nappearance suspecting something quite familiar and without interest,\npushed aside that dingy, unregistered, brown-paper parcel directed in an\nunknown hand, and for two whole days let it lie forgotten. Indeed there\nit might be lying now, had not another person been moved to curiosity,\nand opening it, found within a bundle of manuscript badly burned upon\nthe back, and with this two letters addressed to myself.\n\nAlthough so great a time had passed since I saw it, and it was shaky\nnow because of the author's age or sickness, I knew the writing at\nonce--nobody ever made an \"H\" with that peculiar twirl under it except\nMr. Holly. I tore open the sealed envelope, and sure enough the first\nthing my eye fell upon was the signature, _L. H. Holly_. It is long\nsince I read anything so eagerly as I did that letter. Here it is:--\n\n\"My dear sir,--I have ascertained that you still live, and strange to\nsay I still live also--for a little while.\n\n\"As soon as I came into touch with civilization again I found a copy of\nyour book _She_, or rather of my book, and read it--first of all in a\nHindostani translation. My host--he was a minister of some religious\nbody, a man of worthy but prosaic mind--expressed surprise that a 'wild\nromance' should absorb me so much. I answered that those who have wide\nexperience of the hard facts of life often find interest in romance. Had\nhe known what were the hard facts to which I alluded, I wonder what that\nexcellent person would have said?\n\n\"I see that you carried out your part of the business well and\nfaithfully. Every instruction has been obeyed, nothing has been added or\ntaken away. Therefore, to you, to whom some twenty years ago I entrusted\nthe beginning of the history, I wish to entrust its end also. You were\nthe first to learn of _She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed_, who from century to\ncentury sat alone, clothed with unchanging loveliness in the sepulchres\nof Kor, waiting till her lost love was born again, and Destiny brought\nhim back to her.\n\n\"It is right, therefore, that you should be the first to learn also of\nAyesha, Hesea and Spirit of the Mountain, the priestess of that Oracle\nwhich since the time of Alexander the Great has reigned between the\nflaming pillars in the Sanctuary, the last holder of the sceptre of Hes\nor Isis upon the earth. It is right also that to you first among men\nI should reveal the mystic consummation of the wondrous tragedy which\nbegan at Kor, or perchance far earlier in Egypt and elsewhere.\n\n\"I am very ill; I have struggled back to this old house of mine to die,\nand my end is at hand. I have asked the doctor here, after all is over,\nto send you the Record, that is unless I change my mind and burn it\nfirst. You will also receive, if you receive anything at all, a case\ncontaining several rough sketches which may be of use to you, and a\n_sistrum_, the instrument that has been always used in the worship of\nthe Nature goddesses of the old Egyptians, Isis and Hathor, which you\nwill see is as beautiful as it is ancient. I give it to you for two\nreasons; as a token of my gratitude and regard, and as the only piece of\nevidence that is left to me of the literal truth of what I have written\nin the accompanying manuscript, where you will find it often mentioned.\nPerhaps also you will value it as a souvenir of, I suppose, the\nstrangest and loveliest being who ever was, or rather, is. It was her\nsceptre, the rod of her power, with which I saw her salute the Shadows\nin the Sanctuary, and her gift to me.\n\n\"It has virtues also; some part of Ayesha's might yet haunts the symbol\nto which even spirits bowed, but if you should discover them, beware how\nthey are used.\n\n\"I have neither the strength nor the will to write more. The Record must\nspeak for itself. Do with it what you like, and believe it or not as you\nlike. I care nothing who know that it is true.\n\n\"Who and what was Ayesha, nay, what _is_ Ayesha? An incarnate essence,\na materialised spirit of Nature the unforeseeing, the lovely, the cruel\nand the immortal; ensouled alone, redeemable only by Humanity and its\npiteous sacrifice? Say you! I have done with speculations who depart to\nsolve these mysteries.\n\n\"_I_ wish you happiness and good fortune. Farewell to you and to all.\n\n\"L. Horace Holly.\"\n\n\nI laid the letter down, and, filled with sensations that it is useless\nto attempt to analyse or describe, opened the second envelope, of which\nI also print the contents, omitting only certain irrelevant portions,\nand the name of the writer as, it will be noted, he requests me to do.\n\nThis epistle, that was dated from a remote place upon the shores of\nCumberland, ran as follows:--\n\n\"Dear sir,--As the doctor who attended Mr. Holly in his last illness I\nam obliged, in obedience to a promise that I made to him, to become an\nintermediary in a some what strange business, although in truth it is\none of which I know very little, however much it may have interested me.\nStill I do so only on the strict understanding that no mention is to\nbe made of my name in connexion with the matter, or of the locality in\nwhich I practise.\n\n\"About ten days ago I was called in to see Mr. Holly at an old house\nupon the Cliff that for many years remained untenanted except by the\ncaretakers, which house was his property, and had been in his family for\ngenerations. The housekeeper who summoned me told me that her master had\nbut just returned from abroad, somewhere in Asia, she said, and that\nhe was very ill with his heart--dying, she believed; both of which\nsuppositions proved to be accurate.\n\n\"I found the patient sitting up in bed (to ease his heart), and a\nstrange-looking old man he was. He had dark eyes, small but full of fire\nand intelligence, a magnificent and snowy-white beard that covered a\nchest of extraordinary breadth, and hair also white, which encroached\nupon his forehead and face so much that it met the whiskers upon his\ncheeks. His arms were remarkable for their length and strength, though\none of them seemed to have been much torn by some animal. He told me\nthat a dog had done this, but if so it must have been a dog of unusual\npower. He was a very ugly man, and yet, forgive the bull, beautiful. I\ncannot describe what I mean better than by saying that his face was\nnot like the face of any ordinary mortal whom I have met in my\nlimited experience. Were I an artist who wished to portray a wise and\nbenevolent, but rather grotesque spirit, I should take that countenance\nas a model.\n\n\"Mr. Holly was somewhat vexed at my being called in, which had been done\nwithout his knowledge. Soon we became friendly enough, however, and he\nexpressed gratitude for the relief that I was able to give him, though\nI could not hope to do more. At different times he talked a good deal\nof the various countries in which he had travelled, apparently for very\nmany years, upon some strange quest that he never clearly denned to\nme. Twice also he became light-headed, and spoke, for the most part in\nlanguages that I identified as Greek and Arabic; occasionally in English\nalso, when he appeared to be addressing himself to a being who was the\nobject of his veneration, I might almost say of his worship. What\nhe said then, however, I prefer not to repeat, for I heard it in my\nprofessional capacity.\n\n\"One day he pointed to a rough box made of some foreign wood (the same\nthat I have now duly despatched to you by train), and, giving me your\nname and address, said that without fail it was to be forwarded to you\nafter his death. Also he asked me to do up a manuscript, which, like the\nbox, was to be sent to you.\n\n\"He saw me looking at the last sheets, which had been burned away, and\nsaid (I repeat his exact words)--\n\n\"'Yes, yes, that can't be helped now, it must go as it is. You see I\nmade up my mind to destroy it after all, and it was already on the fire\nwhen the command came--the clear, unmistakable command--and I snatched\nit off again.'\n\n\"What Mr. Holly meant by this 'command' I do not know, for he would\nspeak no more of the matter.\n\n\"I pass on to the last scene. One night about eleven o'clock, knowing\nthat my patient's end was near, I went up to see him, proposing to\ninject some strychnine to keep the heart going a little longer. Before\nI reached the house I met the caretaker coming to seek me in a great\nfright, and asked her if her master was dead. She answered No; but he\nwas _gone_--had got out of bed and, just as he was, barefooted, left\nthe house, and was last seen by her grandson among the very Scotch firs\nwhere we were talking. The lad, who was terrified out of his wits, for\nhe thought that he beheld a ghost, had told her so.\n\n\"The moonlight was very brilliant that night, especially as fresh snow\nhad fallen, which reflected its rays. I was on foot, and began to search\namong the firs, till presently just outside of them I found the track of\nnaked feet in the snow. Of course I followed, calling to the housekeeper\nto go and wake her husband, for no one else lives near by. The spoor\nproved very easy to trace across the clean sheet of snow. It ran up the\nslope of a hill behind the house.\n\n\"Now, on the crest of this hill is an ancient monument of upright\nmonoliths set there by some primeval people, known locally as the\nDevil's Ring--a sort of miniature Stonehenge in fact. I had seen it\nseveral times, and happened to have been present not long ago at a\nmeeting of an archaeological society when its origin and purpose were\ndiscussed. I remember that one learned but somewhat eccentric gentleman\nread a short paper upon a rude, hooded bust and head that are cut within\nthe chamber of a tall, flat-topped cromlech, or dolmen, which stands\nalone in the centre of the ring.\n\n\"He said that it was a representation of the Egyptian goddess, Isis, and\nthat this place had once been sacred to some form of her worship, or at\nany rate to that of a Nature goddess with like attributes, a suggestion\nwhich the other learned gentlemen treated as absurd. They declared that\nIsis had never travelled into Britain, though for my part I do not see\nwhy the Phoenicians, or even the Romans, who adopted her cult, more\nor less, should not have brought it here. But I know nothing of such\nmatters and will not discuss them.\n\n\"I remembered also that Mr. Holly was acquainted with this place, for\nhe had mentioned it to me on the previous day, asking if the stones were\nstill uninjured as they used to be when he was young. He added also, and\nthe remark struck me, that yonder was where he would wish to die. When I\nanswered that I feared he would never take so long a walk again, I noted\nthat he smiled a little.\n\n\"Well, this conversation gave me a clue, and without troubling more\nabout the footprints I went on as fast as I could to the Ring, half a\nmile or so away. Presently I reached it, and there--yes, there--standing\nby the cromlech, bareheaded, and clothed in his night-things only,\nstood Mr. Holly in the snow, the strangest figure, I think, that ever I\nbeheld.\n\n\"Indeed never shall I forget that wild scene. The circle of rough,\nsingle stones pointing upwards to the star-strewn sky, intensely lonely\nand intensely solemn: the tall trilithon towering above them in the\ncentre, its shadow, thrown by the bright moon behind it, lying long\nand black upon the dazzling sheet of snow, and, standing clear of this\nshadow so that I could distinguish his every motion, and even the rapt\nlook upon his dying face, the white-draped figure of Mr. Holly. He\nappeared to be uttering some invocation--in Arabic, I think--for long\nbefore I reached him I could catch the tones of his full, sonorous\nvoice, and see his waving, outstretched arms. In his right hand he held\nthe looped sceptre which, by his express wish I send to you with the\ndrawings. I could see the flash of the jewels strung upon the wires, and\nin the great stillness, hear the tinkling of its golden bells.\n\n\"Presently, too, I seemed to become aware of another presence, and now\nyou will understand why I desire and must ask that my identity should\nbe suppressed. Naturally enough I do not wish to be mixed up with a\nsuperstitious tale which is, on the face of it, impossible and absurd.\nYet under all the circumstances I think it right to tell you that I saw,\nor thought I saw, something gather in the shadow of the central dolmen,\nor emerge from its rude chamber--I know not which for certain--something\nbright and glorious which gradually took the form of a woman upon whose\nforehead burned a star-like fire.\n\n\"At any rate the vision or reflection, or whatever it was, startled me\nso much that I came to a halt under the lee of one of the monoliths, and\nfound myself unable even to call to the distraught man whom I pursued.\n\n\"Whilst I stood thus it became clear to me that Mr. Holly also saw\nsomething. At least he turned towards the Radiance in the shadow,\nuttered one cry; a wild, glad cry, and stepped forward; then seemed to\nfall _through it_ on to his face.\n\n\"When I reached the spot the light had vanished, and all I found was Mr.\nHolly, his arms still outstretched, and the sceptre gripped tightly in\nhis hand, lying quite dead in the shadow of the trilithon.\"\n\n\nThe rest of the doctor's letter need not be quoted as it deals only with\ncertain very improbable explanations of the origin of this figure of\nlight, the details of the removal of Holly's body, and of how he managed\nto satisfy the coroner that no inquest was necessary.\n\nThe box of which he speaks arrived safely. Of the drawings in it I need\nsay nothing, and of the _sistrum_ or sceptre only a few words. It was\nfashioned of crystal to the well-known shape of the _Crux-ansata_, or\nthe emblem of life of the Egyptians; the rod, the cross and the loop\ncombined in one. From side to side of this loop ran golden wires, and on\nthese were strung gems of three colours, glittering diamonds, sea-blue\nsapphires, and blood-red rubies, while to the fourth wire, that at the\ntop, hung four little golden bells.\n\nWhen I took hold of it first my arm shook slightly with excitement, and\nthose bells began to sound; a sweet, faint music like to that of chimes\nheard far away at night in the silence of the sea. I thought too, but\nperhaps this was fancy, that a thrill passed from the hallowed and\nbeautiful thing into my body.\n\nOn the mystery itself, as it is recorded in the manuscript, I make no\ncomment. Of it and its inner significations every reader must form his\nor her own judgment. One thing alone is clear to me--on the hypothesis\nthat Mr. Holly tells the truth as to what he and Leo Vincey saw\nand experienced, which I at least believe--that though sundry\ninterpretations of this mystery were advanced by Ayesha and others, none\nof them are quite satisfactory.\n\nIndeed, like Mr. Holly, I incline to the theory that She, if I may still\ncall her by that name although it is seldom given to her in these pages,\nput forward some of them, such as the vague Isis-myth, and the wondrous\npicture-story of the Mountain-fire, as mere veils to hide the truth\nwhich it was her purpose to reveal at last in that song she never sang.\n\nThe Editor.\n\n\n\n\n\nAYESHA\n\nThe Further History of She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nTHE DOUBLE SIGN\n\nHard on twenty years have gone by since that night of Leo's vision--the\nmost awful years, perhaps, which were ever endured by men--twenty years\nof search and hardship ending in soul-shaking wonder and amazement.\n\nMy death is very near to me, and of this I am glad, for I desire to\npursue the quest in other realms, as it has been promised to me that I\nshall do. I desire to learn the beginning and the end of the spiritual\ndrama of which it has been my strange lot to read some pages upon earth.\n\nI, Ludwig Horace Holly, have been very ill; they carried me, more dead\nthan alive, down those mountains whose lowest slopes I can see from my\nwindow, for I write this on the northern frontiers of India. Indeed any\nother man had long since perished, but Destiny kept my breath in me,\nperhaps that a record might remain. I must bide here a month or two\ntill I am strong enough to travel homewards, for I have a fancy to die\nin the place where I was born. So while I have strength I will put the\nstory down, or at least those parts of it that are most essential, for\nmuch can, or at any rate must, be omitted. I shrink from attempting too\nlong a book, though my notes and memory would furnish me with sufficient\nmaterial for volumes.\n\nI will begin with the Vision.\n\nAfter Leo Vincey and I came back from Africa in 1885, desiring solitude,\nwhich indeed we needed sorely to recover from the fearful shock we had\nexperienced, and to give us time and opportunity to think, we went to an\nold house upon the shores of Cumberland that has belonged to my family\nfor many generations. This house, unless somebody has taken it believing\nme to be dead, is still my property and thither I travel to die.\n\nThose whose eyes read the words I write, if any should ever read them,\nmay ask--What shock?\n\nWell, I am Horace Holly, and my companion, my beloved friend, my son in\nthe spirit whom I reared from infancy was--nay, is--Leo Vincey.\n\nWe are those men who, following an ancient clue, travelled to the Caves\nof Kor in Central Africa, and there discovered her whom we sought,\nthe immortal _She-who-must-be-obeyed_. In Leo she found her love, that\nre-born Kallikrates, the Grecian priest of Isis whom some two thousand\nyears before she had slain in her jealous rage, thus executing on him\nthe judgment of the angry goddess. In her also I found the divinity whom\nI was doomed to worship from afar, not with the flesh, for that is all\nlost and gone from me, but, what is sorer still, because its burden\nis undying, with the will and soul which animate a man throughout the\ncountless eons of his being. The flesh dies, or at least it changes, and\nits passions pass, but that other passion of the spirit--that longing\nfor oneness--is undying as itself.\n\nWhat crime have I committed that this sore punishment should be laid\nupon me? Yet, in truth, is it a punishment? May it not prove to be\nbut that black and terrible Gate which leads to the joyous palace of\nRewards? She swore that I should ever be her friend and his and dwell\nwith them eternally, and I believe her.\n\nFor how many winters did we wander among the icy hills and deserts!\nStill, at length, the Messenger came and led us to the Mountain, and on\nthe Mountain we found the Shrine, and in the Shrine the Spirit. May not\nthese things be an allegory prepared for our instruction? I will take\ncomfort. I will hope that it is so. Nay, I am sure that it is so.\n\nIt will be remembered that in Kor we found the immortal woman. There\nbefore the flashing rays and vapours of the Pillar of Life she declared\nher mystic love, and then in our very sight was swept to a doom so\nhorrible that even now, after all which has been and gone, I shiver at\nits recollection. Yet what were Ayesha's last words? \"_Forget me\nnot . . . have pity on my shame. I die not. I shall come again and shall\nonce more be beautiful. I swear it--it is true._\"\n\nWell, I cannot set out that history afresh. Moreover it is written; the\nman whom I trusted in the matter did not fail me, and the book he made\nof it seems to be known throughout the world, for I have found it here\nin English, yes, and read it first translated into Hindostani. To it\nthen I refer the curious.\n\nIn that house upon the desolate sea-shore of Cumberland, we dwelt a\nyear, mourning the lost, seeking an avenue by which it might be found\nagain and discovering none. Here our strength came back to us, and Leo's\nhair, that had been whitened in the horror of the Caves, grew again from\ngrey to golden. His beauty returned to him also, so that his face was as\nit had been, only purified and saddened.\n\nWell I remember that night--and the hour of illumination. We were\nheart-broken, we were in despair. We sought signs and could find none.\nThe dead remained dead to us and no answer came to all our crying.\n\nIt was a sullen August evening, and after we had dined we walked upon\nthe shore, listening to the slow surge of the waves and watching the\nlightning flicker from the bosom of a distant cloud. In silence we\nwalked, till at last Leo groaned--it was more of a sob than a groan--and\nclasped my arm.\n\n\"I can bear it no longer, Horace,\" he said--for so he called me now--\"I\nam in torment. The desire to see Ayesha once more saps my brain. Without\nhope I shall go quite mad. And I am strong, I may live another fifty\nyears.\"\n\n\"What then can you do?\" I asked.\n\n\"I can take a short road to knowledge--or to peace,\" he answered\nsolemnly, \"I can die, and die I will--yes, tonight.\"\n\nI turned upon him angrily, for his words filled me with fear.\n\n\"Leo, you are a coward!\" I said. \"Cannot you bear your part of pain\nas--others do?\"\n\n\"You mean as you do, Horace,\" he answered with a dreary laugh, \"for on\nyou also the curse lies--with less cause. Well, you are stronger than I\nam, and more tough; perhaps because you have lived longer. No, I cannot\nbear it. I will die.\"\n\n\"It is a crime,\" I said, \"the greatest insult you can offer to the\nPower that made you, to cast back its gift of life as a thing outworn,\ncontemptible and despised. A crime, I say, which will bring with it\nworse punishment than any you can dream; perhaps even the punishment of\neverlasting separation.\"\n\n\"Does a man stretched in some torture-den commit a crime if he snatches\na knife and kills himself, Horace? Perhaps; but surely that sin should\nfind forgiveness--if torn flesh and quivering nerves may plead for\nmercy. I am such a man, and I will use that knife and take my chance.\nShe is dead, and in death at least I shall be nearer her.\"\n\n\"Why so, Leo? For aught you know Ayesha may be living.\"\n\n\"No; for then she would have given me some sign. My mind is made up, so\ntalk no more, or, if talk we must, let it be of other things.\"\n\nThen I pleaded with him, though with little hope, for I saw that what I\nhad feared for long was come to pass. Leo was mad: shock and sorrow\nhad destroyed his reason. Were it not so, he, in his own way a very\nreligious man, one who held, as I knew, strict opinions on such matters,\nwould never have purposed to commit the wickedness of suicide.\n\n\"Leo,\" I said, \"are you so heartless that you would leave me here alone?\nDo you pay me thus for all my love and care, and wish to drive me to my\ndeath? Do so if you will, and my blood be on your head.\"\n\n\"Your blood! Why your blood, Horace?\"\n\n\"Because that road is broad and two can travel it. We have lived long\nyears together and together endured much; I am sure that we shall not be\nlong parted.\"\n\nThen the tables were turned and he grew afraid for me. But I only\nanswered, \"If you die I tell you that I shall die also. It will\ncertainly kill me.\"\n\nSo Leo gave way. \"Well,\" he exclaimed suddenly, \"I promise you it shall\nnot be to-night. Let us give life another chance.\"\n\n\"Good,\" I answered; but I went to my bed full of fear. For I was certain\nthat this desire of death, having once taken hold of him, would grow\nand grow, until at length it became too strong, and then--then I should\nwither and die who could not live on alone. In my despair I threw out my\nsoul towards that of her who was departed.\n\n\"Ayesha!\" I cried, \"if you have any power, if in any way it is\npermitted, show that you still live, and save your lover from this sin\nand me from a broken heart. Have pity on his sorrow and breathe hope\ninto his spirit, for without hope Leo cannot live, and without him I\nshall not live.\"\n\nThen, worn out, I slept.\n\nI was aroused by the voice of Leo speaking to me in low, excited tones\nthrough the darkness.\n\n\"Horace,\" he said, \"Horace, my friend, my father, listen!\"\n\nIn an instant I was wide awake, every nerve and fibre of me, for the\ntones of his voice told me that something had happened which bore upon\nour destinies.\n\n\"Let me light a candle first,\" I said.\n\n\"Never mind the candle, Horace; I would rather speak in the dark. I went\nto sleep, and I dreamed the most vivid dream that ever came to me. I\nseemed to stand under the vault of heaven, it was black, black, not a\nstar shone in it, and a great loneliness possessed me. Then suddenly\nhigh up in the vault, miles and miles away, I saw a little light and\nthought that a planet had appeared to keep me company. The light began\nto descend slowly, like a floating flake of fire. Down it sank, and down\nand down, till it was but just above me, and I perceived that it was\nshaped like a tongue or fan of flame. At the height of my head from the\nground it stopped and stood steady, and by its ghostly radiance I saw\nthat beneath was the shape of a woman and that the flame burned upon her\nforehead. The radiance gathered strength and now I saw the woman.\n\n\"Horace, it was Ayesha herself, her eyes, her lovely face, her cloudy\nhair, and she looked at me sadly, reproachfully, I thought, as one might\nwho says, 'Why did you doubt?'\n\n\"I tried to speak to her but my lips were dumb. I tried to advance and\nto embrace her, my arms would not move. There was a barrier between us.\nShe lifted her hand and beckoned as though bidding me to follow her.\n\n\"Then she glided away, and, Horace, my spirit seemed to loose itself\nfrom the body and to be given the power to follow. We passed swiftly\neastward, over lands and seas, and--I knew the road. At one point\nshe paused and I looked downwards. Beneath, shining in the moonlight,\nappeared the ruined palaces of Kor, and there not far away was the gulf\nwe trod together.\n\n\"Onward above the marshes, and now we stood upon the Ethiopian's Head,\nand gathered round, watching us earnestly, were the faces of the Arabs,\nour companions who drowned in the sea beneath. Job was among them also,\nand he smiled at me sadly and shook his head, as though he wished to\naccompany us and could not.\n\n\"Across the sea again, across the sandy deserts, across more sea, and\nthe shores of India lay beneath us. Then northward, ever northward,\nabove the plains, till we reached a place of mountains capped with\neternal snow. We passed them and stayed for an instant above a building\nset upon the brow of a plateau. It was a monastery, for old monks droned\nprayers upon its terrace. I shall know it again, for it is built in the\nshape of a half-moon and in front of it sits the gigantic, ruined statue\nof a god who gazes everlastingly across the desert. I knew, how I cannot\nsay, that now we were far past the furthest borders of Thibet and that\nin front of us lay untrodden lands. More mountains stretched beyond that\ndesert, a sea of snowy peaks, hundreds and hundreds of them.\n\n\"Near to the monastery, jutting out into the plain like some rocky\nheadland, rose a solitary hill, higher than all behind. We stood upon\nits snowy crest and waited, till presently, above the mountains and the\ndesert at our feet shot a sudden beam of light that beat upon us like\nsome signal flashed across the sea. On we went, floating down the\nbeam--on over the desert and the mountains, across a great flat land\nbeyond, in which were many villages and a city on a mound, till we lit\nupon a towering peak. Then I saw that this peak was loop-shaped like the\nsymbol of Life of the Egyptians--the _crux-ansata_--and supported by\na lava stem hundreds of feet in height. Also I saw that the fire which\nshone through it rose from the crater of a volcano beyond. Upon the very\ncrest of this loop we rested a while, till the Shadow of Ayesha pointed\ndownward with its hand, smiled and vanished. Then I awoke.\n\n\"Horace, I tell you that the sign has come to us.\"\n\nHis voice died away in the darkness, but I sat still, brooding over what\nI had heard. Leo groped his way to me and, seizing my arm, shook it.\n\n\"Are you asleep?\" he asked angrily. \"Speak, man, speak!\"\n\n\"No,\" I answered, \"never was I more awake. Give me time.\"\n\nThen I rose, and going to the open window, drew up the blind and stood\nthere staring at the sky, which grew pearl-hued with the first faint\ntinge of dawn. Leo came also and leant upon the window-sill, and I could\nfeel that his body was trembling as though with cold. Clearly he was\nmuch moved.\n\n\"You talk of a sign,\" I said to him, \"but in your sign I see nothing but\na wild dream.\"\n\n\"It was no dream,\" he broke in fiercely; \"it was a vision.\"\n\n\"A vision then if you will, but there are visions true and false, and\nhow can we know that this is true? Listen, Leo. What is there in all\nthat wonderful tale which could not have been fashioned in your own\nbrain, distraught as it is almost to madness with your sorrow and your\nlongings? You dreamed that you were alone in the vast universe. Well, is\nnot every living creature thus alone? You dreamed that the shadowy shape\nof Ayesha came to you. Has it ever left your side? You dreamed that she\nled you over sea and land, past places haunted by your memory, above the\nmysterious mountains of the Unknown to an undiscovered peak. Does she\nnot thus lead you through life to that peak which lies beyond the Gates\nof Death? You dreamed----\"\n\n\"Oh! no more of it,\" he exclaimed. \"What I saw, I saw, and that I shall\nfollow. Think as you will, Horace, and do what you will. To-morrow I\nstart for India, with you if you choose to come; if not, without you.\"\n\n\"You speak roughly, Leo,\" I said. \"You forget that _I_ have had no sign,\nand that the nightmare of a man so near to insanity that but a few hours\nago he was determined upon suicide, will be a poor staff to lean on when\nwe are perishing in the snows of Central Asia. A mixed vision, this of\nyours, Leo, with its mountain peak shaped like a _crux-ansata_ and the\nrest. Do you suggest that Ayesha is re-incarnated in Central Asia--as a\nfemale Grand Lama or something of that sort?\"\n\n\"I never thought of it, but why not?\" asked Leo quietly. \"Do you\nremember a certain scene in the Caves of Kor yonder, when the living\nlooked upon the dead, and dead and living were the same? And do you\nremember what Ayesha swore, that she would come again--yes, to this\nworld; and how could that be except by re-birth, or, what is the same\nthing, by the transmigration of the spirit?\"\n\nI did not answer this argument. I was struggling with myself.\n\n\"No sign has come to me,\" I said, \"and yet I have had a part in the\nplay, humble enough, I admit, and I believe that I have still a part.\"\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"no sign has come to you. I wish that it had. Oh! how I\nwish you could be convinced as I am, Horace!\"\n\nThen we were silent for a long while, silent, with our eyes fixed upon\nthe sky.\n\nIt was a stormy dawn. Clouds in fantastic masses hung upon the ocean.\nOne of them was like a great mountain, and we watched it idly. It\nchanged its shape, the crest of it grew hollow like a crater. From this\ncrater sprang a projecting cloud, a rough pillar with a knob or lump\nresting on its top. Suddenly the rays of the risen sun struck upon this\nmountain and the column and they turned white like snow. Then as though\nmelted by those fiery arrows, the centre of the excrescence above the\npillar thinned out and vanished, leaving an enormous loop of inky cloud.\n\n\"Look,\" said Leo in a low, frightened voice, \"that is the shape of the\nmountain which I saw in my vision. There upon it is the black loop, and\nthere through it shines the fire. _It would seem that the sign is for\nboth of us, Horace._\"\n\nI looked and looked again till presently the vast loop vanished into the\nblue of heaven. Then I turned and said--\"I will come with you to Central\nAsia, Leo.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE LAMASERY\n\nSixteen years had passed since that night vigil in the old Cumberland\nhouse, and, behold! we two, Leo and I, were still travelling, still\nsearching for that mountain peak shaped like the Symbol of Life which\nnever, never could be found.\n\nOur adventures would fill volumes, but of what use is it to record them.\nMany of a similar nature are already written of in books; those that we\nendured were more prolonged, that is all. Five years we spent in Thibet,\nfor the most part as guests of various monasteries, where we studied the\nlaw and traditions of the Lamas. Here we were once sentenced to death in\npunishment for having visited a forbidden city, but escaped through the\nkindness of a Chinese official.\n\nLeaving Thibet, we wandered east and west and north, thousands and\nthousands of miles, sojourning amongst many tribes in Chinese territory\nand elsewhere, learning many tongues, enduring much hardship. Thus we\nwould hear a legend of a place, say nine hundred miles away, and spend\ntwo years in reaching it, to find when we came there, nothing.\n\nAnd so the time went on. Yet never once did we think of giving up the\nquest and returning, since, before we started, we had sworn an oath that\nwe would achieve or die. Indeed we ought to have died a score of times,\nyet always were preserved, most mysteriously preserved.\n\nNow we were in country where, so far as I could learn, no European had\never set a foot. In a part of the vast land called Turkestan there is a\ngreat lake named Balhkash, of which we visited the shores. Two hundred\nmiles or so to the westward is a range of mighty mountains marked on the\nmaps as Arkarty-Tau, on which we spent a year, and five hundred or so miles to\nthe eastward are other mountains called Cherga, whither we journeyed at\nlast, having explored the triple ranges of the Tau.\n\nHere it was that at last our true adventures began. On one of the spurs\nof these awful Cherga mountains--it is unmarked on any map--we well-nigh\nperished of starvation. The winter was coming on and we could find no\ngame. The last traveller we had met, hundreds of miles south, told us\nthat on that range was a monastery inhabited by Lamas of surpassing\nholiness. He said that they dwelt in this wild land, over which no power\nclaimed dominion and where no tribes lived, to acquire \"merit,\" with no\nother company than that of their own pious contemplations. We did not\nbelieve in its existence, still we were searching for that monastery,\ndriven onward by the blind fatalism which was our only guide through\nall these endless wanderings. As we were starving and could find no\n\"argals,\" that is fuel with which to make a fire, we walked all night by\nthe light of the moon, driving between us a single yak--for now we had\nno attendant, the last having died a year before.\n\nHe was a noble beast, that yak, and had the best constitution of any\nanimal I ever knew, though now, like his masters, he was near his end.\nNot that he was over-laden, for a few rifle cartridges, about a hundred\nand fifty, the remnant of a store which we had fortunately been able to\nbuy from a caravan two years before, some money in gold and silver, a\nlittle tea and a bundle of skin rugs and sheepskin garments were his\nburden. On, on we trudged across a plateau of snow, having the great\nmountains on our right, till at length the yak gave a sigh and stopped.\nSo we stopped also, because we must, and wrapping ourselves in the skin\nrugs, sat down in the snow to wait for daylight.\n\n\"We shall have to kill him and eat his flesh raw,\" I said, patting the\npoor yak that lay patiently at our side.\n\n\"Perhaps we may find game in the morning,\" answered Leo, still hopeful.\n\n\"And perhaps we may not, in which case we must die.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" he replied, \"then let us die. It is the last resource of\nfailure. We shall have done our best.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Leo, we shall have done our best, if sixteen years of\ntramping over mountains and through eternal snows in pursuit of a dream\nof the night can be called best.\"\n\n\"You know what I believe,\" he answered stubbornly, and there was silence\nbetween us, for here arguments did not avail. Also even then I could not\nthink that all our toils and sufferings would be in vain.\n\nThe dawn came, and by its light we looked at one another anxiously,\neach of us desiring to see what strength was left to his companion. Wild\ncreatures we should have seemed to the eyes of any civilized person.\nLeo was now over forty years of age, and certainly his maturity had\nfulfilled the promise of his youth, for a more magnificent man I never\nknew. Very tall, although he seemed spare to the eye, his girth matched\nhis height, and those many years of desert life had turned his muscles\nto steel. His hair had grown long, like my own, for it was a protection\nfrom sun and cold, and hung upon his neck, a curling, golden mane, as\nhis great beard hung upon his breast, spreading outwards almost to\nthe massive shoulders. The face, too--what could be seen of it--was\nbeautiful though burnt brown with weather; refined and full of thought,\nsombre almost, and in it, clear as crystal, steady as stars, shone his\nlarge grey eyes.\n\nAnd I--I was what I have always been--ugly and hirsute, iron-grey now\nalso, but in spite of my sixty odd years, still wonderfully strong, for\nmy strength seemed to increase with time, and my health was perfect. In\nfact, during all this period of rough travels, although now and again\nwe had met with accidents which laid us up for awhile, neither of us\nhad known a day of sickness. Hardship seemed to have turned our\nconstitutions to iron and made them impervious to every human ailment.\nOr was this because we alone amongst living men had once inhaled the\nbreath of the Essence of Life?\n\nOur fears relieved--for notwithstanding our foodless night, as yet\nneither of us showed any signs of exhaustion--we turned to contemplate\nthe landscape. At our feet beyond a little belt of fertile soil, began\na great desert of the sort with which we were familiar--sandy,\nsalt-encrusted, treeless, waterless, and here and there streaked with\nthe first snows of winter. Beyond it, eighty or a hundred miles away--in\nthat lucent atmosphere it was impossible to say how far exactly--rose\nmore mountains, a veritable sea of them, of which the white peaks soared\nupwards by scores.\n\nAs the golden rays of the rising sun touched their snows to splendour,\nI saw Leo's eyes become troubled. Swiftly he turned and looked along the\nedge of the desert.\n\n\"See there!\" he said, pointing to something dim and enormous. Presently\nthe light reached it also. It was a mighty mountain not more than ten\nmiles away, that stood out by itself among the sands. Then he turned\nonce more, and with his back to the desert stared at the slope of the\nhills, along the base of which we had been travelling. As yet they were\nin gloom, for the sun was behind them, but presently light began to flow\nover their crests like a flood. Down it crept, lower, and yet lower,\ntill it reached a little plateau not three hundred yards above us.\nThere, on the edge of the plateau, looking out solemnly across the\nwaste, sat a great ruined idol, a colossal Buddha, while to the rear of\nthe idol, built of yellow stone, appeared the low crescent-shaped mass\nof a monastery.\n\n\"At last!\" cried Leo, \"oh, Heaven! at last!\" and, flinging himself down,\nhe buried his face in the snow as though to hide it there, lest I should\nread something written on it which he did not desire that even I should\nsee.\n\nI let him lie a space, understanding what was passing in his heart,\nand indeed in mine also. Then going to the yak that, poor brute, had\nno share in these joyous emotions but only lowed and looked round with\nhungry eyes, I piled the sheepskin rugs on to its back. This done, I\nlaid my hand on Leo's shoulder, saying, in the most matter-of-fact voice\nI could command--\"Come. If that place is not deserted, we may find food\nand shelter there, and it is beginning to storm again.\"\n\nHe rose without a word, brushed the snow from his beard and garments and\ncame to help me to lift the yak to its feet, for the worn-out beast was\ntoo stiff and weak to rise of itself. Glancing at him covertly, I saw\non Leo's face a very strange and happy look; a great peace appeared to\npossess him.\n\nWe plunged upwards through the snow slope, dragging the yak with us, to\nthe terrace whereon the monastery was built. Nobody seemed to be about\nthere, nor could I discern any footprints. Was the place but a ruin? We\nhad found many such; indeed this ancient land is full of buildings that\nhad once served as the homes of men, learned and pious enough after\ntheir own fashion, who lived and died hundreds, or even thousands, of\nyears ago, long before our Western civilization came into being.\n\nMy heart, also my stomach, which was starving, sank at the thought,\nbut while I gazed doubtfully, a little coil of blue smoke sprang from\na chimney, and never, I think, did I see a more joyful sight. In the\ncentre of the edifice was a large building, evidently the temple, but\nnearer to us I saw a small door, almost above which the smoke appeared.\nTo this door I went and knocked, calling aloud--\"Open! open, holy\nLamas. Strangers seek your charity.\" After awhile there was a sound of\nshuffling feet and the door creaked upon its hinges, revealing an old,\nold man, clad in tattered, yellow garments.\n\n\"Who is it? Who is it?\" he exclaimed, blinking at me through a pair of\nhorn spectacles. \"Who comes to disturb our solitude, the solitude of the\nholy Lamas of the Mountains?\"\n\n\"Travellers, Sacred One, who have had enough of solitude,\" I answered in\nhis own dialect, with which I was well acquainted. \"Travellers who are\nstarving and who ask your charity, which,\" I added, \"by the Rule you\ncannot refuse.\"\n\nHe stared at us through his horn spectacles, and, able to make nothing\nof our faces, let his glance fall to our garments which were as ragged\nas his own, and of much the same pattern. Indeed, they were those of\nThibetan monks, including a kind of quilted petticoat and an outer\nvestment not unlike an Eastern burnous. We had adopted them because we\nhad no others. Also they protected us from the rigours of the climate\nand from remark, had there been any to remark upon them.\n\n\"Are you Lamas?\" he asked doubtfully, \"and if so, of what monastery?\"\n\n\"Lamas sure enough,\" I answered, \"who belong to a monastery called the\nWorld, where, alas! one grows hungry.\"\n\nThe reply seemed to please him, for he chuckled a little, then shook his\nhead, saying--\"It is against our custom to admit strangers unless they\nbe of our own faith, which I am sure you are not.\"\n\n\"And much more is it against your Rule, holy Khubilghan,\" for so these\nabbots are entitled, \"to suffer strangers to starve\"; and I quoted a\nwell-known passage from the sayings of Buddha which fitted the point\nprecisely.\n\n\"I perceive that you are instructed in the Books,\" he exclaimed with\nwonder on his yellow, wrinkled face, \"and to such we cannot refuse\nshelter. Come in, brethren of the monastery called the World. But stay,\nthere is the yak, who also has claims upon our charity,\" and, turning,\nhe struck upon a gong or bell which hung within the door.\n\nAt the sound another man appeared, more wrinkled and to all appearance\nolder than the first, who stared at us open-mouthed.\n\n\"Brother,\" said the abbot, \"shut that great mouth of yours lest an evil\nspirit should fly down it; take this poor yak and give it fodder with\nthe other cattle.\"\n\nSo we unstrapped our belongings from the back of the beast, and the old\nfellow whose grandiloquent title was \"Master of the Herds,\" led it away.\n\nWhen it had gone, not too willingly--for our faithful friend disliked\nparting from us and distrusted this new guide--the abbot, who was\nnamed Kou-en, led us into the living room or rather the kitchen of the\nmonastery, for it served both purposes. Here we found the rest of the\nmonks, about twelve in all, gathered round the fire of which we had seen\nthe smoke, and engaged, one of them in preparing the morning meal, and\nthe rest in warming themselves.\n\nThey were all old men; the youngest could not have been less than\nsixty-five. To these we were solemnly introduced as \"Brethren of the\nMonastery called the World, where folk grow hungry,\" for the abbot\nKou-en could not make up his mind to part from this little joke.\n\nThey stared at us, they rubbed their thin hands, they bowed and wished\nus well and evidently were delighted at our arrival. This was not\nstrange, however, seeing that ours were the first new faces which they\nhad seen for four long years.\n\nNor did they stop at words, for while they made water hot for us to wash\nin, two of them went to prepare a room--and others drew off our rough\nhide boots and thick outer garments and brought us slippers for our\nfeet. Then they led us to the guest chamber, which they informed us was\na \"propitious place,\" for once it had been slept in by a noted saint.\nHere a fire was lit, and, wonder of wonders! clean garments, including\nlinen, all of them ancient and faded, but of good quality, were brought\nfor us to put on.\n\nSo we washed--yes, actually washed all over--and having arrayed\nourselves in the robes, which were somewhat small for Leo, struck the\nbell that hung in the room and were conducted by a monk who answered it,\nback to the kitchen, where the meal was now served. It consisted of a\nkind of porridge, to which was added new milk brought in by the \"Master\nof the Herds,\" dried fish from a lake, and buttered tea, the last two\nluxuries produced in our special honour. Never had food tasted more\ndelicious to us, and, I may add, never did we eat more. Indeed, at last\nI was obliged to request Leo to stop, for I saw the monks staring at him\nand heard the old abbot chuckling to himself.\n\n\"Oho! The Monastery of the World, where folk grow _hungry_,\" to which\nanother monk, who was called the \"Master of the Provisions,\" replied\nuneasily, that if we went on like this, their store of food would\nscarcely last the winter. So we finished at length, feeling, as some\nbook of maxims which I can remember in my youth said all polite people\nshould do--that we could eat more, and much impressed our hosts by\nchanting a long Buddhist grace.\n\n\"Their feet are in the Path! Their feet are in the Path!\" they said,\nastonished.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Leo, \"they have been in it for sixteen years of our\npresent incarnation. But we are only beginners, for you, holy Ones, know\nhow star-high, how ocean-wide and how desert-long is that path. Indeed\nit is to be instructed as to the right way of walking therein that we\nhave been miraculously directed by a dream to seek you out, as the most\npious, the most saintly and the most learned of all the Lamas in these\nparts.\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly we are that,\" answered the abbot Kou-en, \"seeing that\nthere is no other monastery within five months' journey,\" and again he\nchuckled, \"though, alas!\" he added with a pathetic little sigh, \"our\nnumbers grow few.\"\n\nAfter this we asked leave to retire to our chamber in order to rest, and\nthere, upon very good imitations of beds, we slept solidly for four and\ntwenty hours, rising at last perfectly refreshed and well.\n\nSuch was our introduction to the Monastery of the Mountains--for it had\nno other name--where we were destined to spend the next six months of\nour lives. Within a few days--for they were not long in giving us their\ncomplete confidence--those good-hearted and simple old monks told us all\ntheir history.\n\nIt seemed that of old time there was a Lamasery here, in which dwelt\nseveral hundred brethren. This, indeed, was obviously true, for the\nplace was enormous, although for the most part ruined, and, as the\nweather-worn statue of Buddha showed, very ancient. The story ran,\naccording to the old abbot, that two centuries or so before, the monks\nhad been killed out by some fierce tribe who lived beyond the desert and\nacross the distant mountains, which tribe were heretics and worshippers\nof fire. Only a few of them escaped to bring the sad news to other\ncommunities, and for five generations no attempt was made to re-occupy\nthe place.\n\nAt length it was revealed to him, our friend Kou-en, when a young man,\nthat he was a re-incarnation of one of the old monks of this monastery,\nwho also was named Kou-en, and that it was his duty during his present\nlife to return thither, as by so doing he would win much merit and\nreceive many wonderful revelations. So he gathered a band of zealots\nand, with the blessing and consent of his superiors, they started out,\nand after many hardships and losses found and took possession of the\nplace, repairing it sufficiently for their needs.\n\nThis happened about fifty years before, and here they had dwelt ever\nsince, only communicating occasionally with the outside world. At first\ntheir numbers were recruited from time to time by new brethren, but\nat length these ceased to come, with the result that the community was\ndying out.\n\n\"And what then?\" I asked.\n\n\"And then,\" the abbot answered, \"nothing. _We_ have acquired much merit;\nwe have been blest with many revelations, and, after the repose we have\nearned in Devachan, our lots in future existences will be easier. What\nmore can we ask or desire, removed as we are from all the temptations of\nthe world?\"\n\nFor the rest, in the intervals of their endless prayers, and still more\nendless contemplations, they were husbandmen, cultivating the soil,\nwhich was fertile at the foot of the mountain, and tending their herd of\nyaks. Thus they wore away their blameless lives until at last they died\nof old age, and, as they believed--and who shall say that they were\nwrong--the eternal round repeated itself elsewhere.\n\nImmediately after, indeed on the very day of our arrival at the\nmonastery the winter began in earnest with bitter cold and snowstorms\nso heavy and frequent that all the desert was covered deep. Very soon it\nbecame obvious to us that here we must stay until the spring, since\nto attempt to move in any direction would be to perish. With some\nmisgivings we explained this to the abbot Kou-en, offering to remove to\none of the empty rooms in the ruined part of the building, supporting\nourselves with fish that we could catch by cutting a hole in the ice of\nthe lake above the monastery, and if we were able to find any, on game,\nwhich we might trap or shoot in the scrub-like forest of stunted pines\nand junipers that grew around its border. But he would listen to no such\nthing. We had been sent to be their guests, he said, and their guests\nwe should remain for so long as might be convenient to us. Would we lay\nupon them the burden of the sin of inhospitality? Besides, he remarked\nwith his chuckle--\"We who dwell alone like to hear about that other\ngreat monastery called the World, where the monks are not so favoured as\nwe who are set in this blessed situation, and where folk even go hungry\nin body, and,\" he added, \"in soul.\"\n\nIndeed, as we soon found out, the dear old man's object was to keep our\nfeet in the Path until we reached the goal of Truth, or, in other words,\nbecame excellent Lamas like himself and his flock.\n\nSo we walked in the Path, as we had done in many another Lamasery,\nand assisted at the long prayers in the ruined temple and studied the\n_Kandjur_, or \"Translation of the Words\" of Buddha, which is their bible\nand a very long one, and generally showed that our \"minds were open.\"\nAlso we expounded to them the doctrines of our own faith, and greatly\ndelighted were they to find so many points of similarity between it and\ntheirs. Indeed, I am not certain but that if we could have stopped there\nlong enough, say ten years, we might have persuaded some of them to\naccept a new revelation of which we were the prophets. Further, in spare\nhours we told them many tales of \"the Monastery called the World,\" and\nit was really delightful, and in a sense piteous, to see the joy with\nwhich they listened to these stories of wondrous countries and new races\nof men; they who knew only of Russia and China and some semi-savage\ntribes, inhabitants of the mountains and the deserts.\n\n\"It is right for us to learn all this,\" they declared, \"for, who knows,\nperhaps in future incarnations we may become inhabitants of these\nplaces.\"\n\nBut though the time passed thus in comfort and indeed, compared to many\nof our experiences, in luxury, oh! our hearts were hungry, for in them\nburned the consuming fire of our quest. We felt that we were on the\nthreshold--yes, we knew it, we knew it, and yet our wretched physical\nlimitations made it impossible for us to advance by a single step. On\nthe desert beneath fell the snow, moreover great winds arose suddenly\nthat drove those snows like dust, piling them in heaps as high as trees,\nbeneath which any unfortunate traveller would be buried. Here we must\nwait, there was nothing else to be done.\n\nOne alleviation we found, and only one. In a ruined room of the\nmonastery was a library of many volumes, placed there, doubtless, by the\nmonks who were massacred in times bygone. These had been more or less\ncared for and re-arranged by their successors, who gave us liberty to\nexamine them as often as we pleased. Truly it was a strange collection,\nand I should imagine of priceless value, for among them were to be found\nBuddhistic, Sivaistic and Shamanistic writings that we had never before\nseen or heard of, together with the lives of a multitude of Bodhisatvas,\nor distinguished saints, written in various tongues, some of which we\ndid not understand.\n\nWhat proved more interesting to us, however, was a diary in many tomes\nthat for generations had been kept by the Khubilghans or abbots of the\nold Lamasery, in which every event of importance was recorded in great\ndetail. Turning over the pages of one of the last volumes of this\ndiary, written apparently about two hundred and fifty years earlier, and\nshortly before the destruction of the monastery, we came upon an\nentry of which the following--for I can only quote from memory--is the\nsubstance--\n\n\"In the summer of this year, after a very great sandstorm, a brother\n(the name was given, but I forget it) found in the desert a man of the\npeople who dwell beyond the Far Mountains, of whom rumours have reached\nthis Lamasery from time to time. He was living, but beside him were the\nbodies of two of his companions who had been overwhelmed by sand and\nthirst. He was very fierce looking. He refused to say how he came into\nthe desert, telling us only that he had followed the road known to the\nancients before communication between his people and the outer world\nceased. We gathered, however, that his brethren with whom he fled had\ncommitted some crime for which they had been condemned to die, and that\nhe had accompanied them in their flight. He told us that there was a\nfine country beyond the mountains, fertile, but plagued with droughts\nand earthquakes, which latter, indeed, we often feel here.\n\n\"The people of that country were, he said, warlike and very numerous but\nfollowed agriculture. They had always lived there, though ruled by Khans\nwho were descendants of the Greek king called Alexander, who conquered\nmuch country to the south-west of us. This may be true, as our records\ntell us that about two thousand years ago an army sent by that invader\npenetrated to these parts, though of his being with them nothing is\nsaid.\n\n\"The stranger-man told us also that his people worship a priestess\ncalled Hes or the Hesea, who is said to reign from generation to\ngeneration. She lives in a great mountain, apart, and is feared and\nadored by all, but is not the queen of the country, in the government\nof which she seldom interferes. To her, however, sacrifices are offered,\nand he who incurs her vengeance dies, so that even the chiefs of that\nland are afraid of her. Still their subjects often fight, for they hate\neach other.\n\n\"We answered that he lied when he said that this woman was immortal--for\nthat was what we supposed he meant--since nothing is immortal; also we\nlaughed at his tale of her power. This made the man very angry. Indeed\nhe declared that our Buddha was not so strong as this priestess, and\nthat she would show it by being avenged upon us.\n\n\"After this we gave him food and turned him out of the Lamasery, and he\nwent, saying that when he returned we should learn who spoke the truth.\nWe do not know what became of him, and he refused to reveal to us the\nroad to his country, which lies beyond the desert and the Far Mountains.\nWe think that perhaps he was an evil spirit sent to frighten us, in\nwhich he did not succeed.\"\n\n\nSuch is a _precis_ of this strange entry, the discovery of which, vague\nas it was, thrilled us with hope and excitement. Nothing more appeared\nabout the man or his country, but within a little over a year from that\ndate the diary of the abbot came to a sudden end without any indication\nthat unusual events had occured or were expected.\n\nIndeed, the last item written in the parchment book mentioned the\npreparation of certain new lands to be used for the sowing of grain in\nfuture seasons, which suggested that the brethren neither feared nor\nexpected disturbance. We wondered whether the man from beyond the\nmountains was as good as his word and had brought down the vengeance of\nthat priestess called the Hesea upon the community which sheltered him.\nAlso we wondered--ah! how we wondered--who and what this Hesea might be.\n\nOn the day following this discovery we prayed the abbot, Kou-en, to\naccompany us to the library, and having read him the passage, asked\nif he knew anything of the matter. He swayed his wise old head, which\nalways reminded me of that of a tortoise, and answered--\"A little.\nVery little, and that mostly about the army of the Greek king who is\nmentioned in the writing.\"\n\nWe inquired what he could possibly know of this matter, whereon Kou-en\nreplied calmly--\"In those days when the faith of the Holy One was still\nyoung, I dwelt as a humble brother in this very monastery, which was\none of the first built, and I saw the army pass, that is all. That,\"\nhe added meditatively, \"was in my fiftieth incarnation of this present\nRound--no, I am thinking of another army--in my seventy-third.\"[*]\n\n     [*] As students of their lives and literature will be aware,\n     it is common for Buddhist priests to state positively that\n     they remember events which occurred during their previous\n     incarnations.--ed.\n\nHere Leo began a great laugh, but I managed to kick him beneath the\ntable and he turned it into a sneeze. This was fortunate, as such ribald\nmerriment would have hurt the old man's feelings terribly. After all,\nalso, as Leo himself had once said, surely we were not the people to\nmock at the theory of re-incarnation, which, by the way, is the first\narticle of faith among nearly one quarter of the human race, and this\nnot the most foolish quarter.\n\n\"How can that be--I ask for instruction, learned One--seeing that memory\nperishes with death?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" he answered, \"Brother Holly, it may seem to do so, but oftentimes\nit comes back again, especially to those who are far advanced upon the\nPath. For instance, until you read this passage I had forgotten all\nabout that army, but now I see it passing, passing, and myself with\nother monks standing by the statue of the big Buddha in front yonder,\nand watching it go by. It was not a very large army, for most of the\nsoldiers had died, or been killed, and it was being pursued by the wild\npeople who lived south of us in those days, so that it was in a great\nhurry to put the desert between it and them. The general of the army was\na swarthy man--I wish that I could remember his name, but I cannot.\n\n\"Well,\" he went on, \"that general came up to the Lamasery and demanded a\nsleeping place for his wife and children, also provisions and medicines,\nand guides across the desert. The abbot of that day told him it was\nagainst our law to admit a woman under our roof, to which he answered\nthat if we did not, we should have no roof left, for he would burn the\nplace and kill every one of us with the sword. Now, as you know, to be\nkilled by violence means that we must pass sundry incarnations in the\nforms of animals, a horrible thing, so we chose the lesser evil and\ngave way, and afterwards obtained absolution for our sins from the Great\nLama. Myself I did not see this queen, but I saw the priestess of their\nworship--alas! alas!\" and Kou-en beat his breast.\n\n\"Why alas?\" I asked, as unconcernedly as I could, for this story\ninterested me strangely.\n\n\"Why? Oh! because I may have forgotten the army, but I have never\nforgotten that priestess, and she has been a great hindrance to me\nthrough many ages, delaying me upon my journey to the Other Side, to the\nShore of Salvation. I, as a humble Lama, was engaged in preparing her\napartment when she entered and threw aside her veil; yes, and perceiving\na young man, spoke to me, asking many questions, and even if I was not\nglad to look again upon a woman.\"\n\n\"What--what was she like?\" said Leo, anxiously.\n\n\"What was she like? Oh! She was all loveliness in one shape; she was\nlike the dawn upon the snows; she was like the evening star above the\nmountains; she was like the first flower of the spring. Brother, ask me\nnot what she was like, nay, I will say no more. Oh! my sin, my sin. I am\nslipping backward and you draw my black shame out into the light of day.\nNay, I will confess it that you may know how vile a thing I am--I whom\nperhaps you have thought holy--like yourselves. That woman, if woman\nshe were, lit a fire in my heart which will not burn out, oh! and more,\nmore,\" and Kou-en rocked himself to and fro upon his stool while tears\nof contrition trickled from beneath his horn spectacles, \"_she made me\nworship her!_ For first she asked me of my faith and listened eagerly as\nI expounded it, hoping that the light would come into her heart; then,\nafter I had finished she said--\"'So your Path is Renunciation and your\nNirvana a most excellent Nothingness which some would think it scarce\nworth while to strive so hard to reach. Now _I_ will show you a more\njoyous way and a goddess more worthy of your worship.'\n\n\"'What way, and what goddess?' I asked of her.\n\n\"'The way of Love and Life!\" she answered, 'that makes all the world\nto be, that made _you_, O seeker of Nirvana, and the goddess called\nNature!'\n\n\"Again I asked where is that goddess, and behold! she drew herself up,\nlooking most royal, and touching her ivory breast, she said, 'I am She.\nNow kneel you down and do me homage!'\n\n\"My brethren, I knelt, yes, I kissed her foot, and then I fled away\nshamed and broken-hearted, and as I went she laughed, and cried:\n'Remember me when you reach Devachan, O servant of the Budda-saint, for\nthough I change, I do not die, and even there I shall be with you who\nonce gave me worship!'\n\n\"And it is so, my brethren, it is so; for though I obtained absolution\nfor my sin and have suffered much for it through this, my next\nincarnation, yet I cannot be rid of her, and for me the Utter Peace is\nfar, far away,\" and Kou-en placed his withered hands before his face and\nsobbed outright.\n\nA ridiculous sight, truly, to see a holy Khublighan well on the wrong\nside of eighty, weeping like a child over a dream of a beautiful woman\nwhich he imagined he had once dreamt in his last life more than two\nthousand years ago. So the reader will say. But I, Holly, for reasons\nof my own, felt deep sympathy with that poor old man, and Leo was also\nsympathetic. We patted him on the back; we assured him that he was\nthe victim of some evil hallucination which could never be brought up\nagainst him in this or any future existence, since, if sin there were,\nit must have been forgiven long ago, and so forth. When his calm was\nsomewhat restored we tried also to extract further information from him,\nbut with poor results, so far as the priestess was concerned.\n\nHe said that he did not know to what religion she belonged, and did not\ncare, but thought that it must be an evil one. She went away the next\nmorning with the army, and he never saw or heard of her any more, though\nit came into his mind that he was obliged to be locked in his cell for\neight days to prevent himself from following her. Yes, he had heard one\nthing, for the abbot of that day had told the brethren. This priestess\nwas the real general of the army, not the king or the queen, the latter\nof whom hated her. It was by her will that they pushed on northwards\nacross the desert to some country beyond the mountains, where she\ndesired to establish herself and her worship.\n\nWe asked if there really was any country beyond the mountains, and\nKou-en answered wearily that he believed so. Either in this or in a\nprevious life he had heard that people lived there who worshipped fire.\nCertainly also it was true that about thirty years ago a brother who had\nclimbed the great peak yonder to spend some days in solitary meditation,\nreturned and reported that he had seen a marvellous thing, namely, a\nshaft of fire burning in the heavens beyond those same mountains, though\nwhether this were a vision, or what, he could not say. He recalled,\nhowever, that about that time they had felt a great earthquake.\n\nThen the memory of that fancied transgression again began to afflict\nKou-en's innocent old heart, and he crept away lamenting and was seen no\nmore for a week. Nor would he ever speak again to us of this matter.\n\nBut we spoke of it much with hope and wonder, and made up our minds that\nwe would at once ascend this mountain.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE BEACON LIGHT\n\nA week later came our opportunity of making this ascent of the mountain,\nfor now in mid-winter it ceased storming, and hard frost set in, which\nmade it possible to walk upon the surface of the snow. Learning from\nthe monks that at this season _ovis poli_ and other kinds of big-horned\nsheep and game descended from the hills to take refuge in certain\nvalleys, where they scraped away the snow to find food, we announced\nthat we were going out to hunt. The excuse we gave was that we were\nsuffering from confinement and needed exercise, having by the teaching\nof our religion no scruples about killing game.\n\nOur hosts replied that the adventure was dangerous, as the weather might\nchange at any moment. They told us, however, that on the slopes of this\nvery mountain which we desired to climb, there was a large natural cave\nwhere, if need be, we could take shelter, and to this cave one of them,\nsomewhat younger and more active than the rest, offered to guide us. So,\nhaving manufactured a rougri tent from skins, and laden our old yak, now\nin the best of condition, with food and garments, on one still morning\nwe started as soon as it was light. Under the guidance of the monk, who,\nnotwithstanding his years, walked very well, we reached the northern\nslope of the peak before mid-day. Here, as he had said, we found a great\ncave of which the opening was protected by an over-hanging ledge of\nrock. Evidently this cave was the favourite place of shelter for game at\ncertain seasons of the year, since in it were heaped vast accumulations\nof their droppings, which removed any fear of a lack of fuel.\n\nThe rest of that short day we spent in setting up our tent in the cave,\nin front of which we lit a large fire, and in a survey of the slopes of\nthe mountain, for we told the monk that we were searching for the tracks\nof wild sheep. Indeed, as it happened, on our way back to the cave we\ncame across a small herd of ewes feeding upon the mosses in a sheltered\nspot where in summer a streamlet ran. Of these we were so fortunate as\nto kill two, for no sportsman had ever come here, and they were tame\nenough, poor things. As meat would keep for ever in that temperature,\nwe had now sufficient food to last us for a fortnight, and dragging the\nanimals down the snow slopes to the cave, we skinned them by the dying\nlight.\n\nThat evening we supped upon fresh mutton, a great luxury, which the\nmonk enjoyed as much as we did, since, whatever might be his views as to\ntaking life, he liked mutton. Then we turned into the tent and huddled\nourselves together for warmth, as the temperature must have been some\ndegrees below zero. The old monk rested well enough, but neither Leo nor\nI slept over much, for wonder as to what we might see from the top of\nthat mountain banished sleep.\n\nNext morning at the dawn, the weather being still favourable, our\ncompanion returned to the monastery, whither we said we would follow him\nin a day or two.\n\nNow at last we were alone, and without wasting an instant began our\nascent of the peak. It was many thousand feet high and in certain places\nsteep enough, but the deep, frozen snow made climbing easy, so that by\nmidday we reached the top. Hence the view was magnificent. Beneath\nus stretched the desert, and beyond it a broad belt of fantastically\nshaped, snow-clad mountains, hundreds and hundreds of them; in front, to\nthe right, to the left, as far as the eye could reach.\n\n\"They are just as I saw them in my dream so many years ago,\" muttered\nLeo; \"the same, the very same.\"\n\n\"And where was the fiery light?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yonder, I think;\" and he pointed north by east.\n\n\"Well, it is not there now,\" I answered, \"and this place is cold.\"\n\nSo, since it was dangerous to linger, lest the darkness should overtake\nus on our return journey, we descended the peak again, reaching the cave\nabout sunset. The next four days we spent in the same way. Every morning\nwe crawled up those wearisome banks of snow, and every afternoon we\nslid and tobogganed down them again, till I grew heartily tired of the\nexercise.\n\nOn the fourth night, instead of coming to sleep in the tent Leo sat\nhimself down at the entrance to the cave. I asked him why he did this,\nbut he answered impatiently, because he wished it, so I left him alone.\nI could see, indeed, that he was in a strange and irritable mood, for\nthe failure of our search oppressed him. Moreover, we knew, both of us,\nthat it could not be much prolonged, since the weather might break at\nany moment, when ascents of the mountain would become impossible.\n\nIn the middle of the night I was awakened by Leo shaking me and\nsaying--\"Come here, Horace, I have something to show you.\"\n\nReluctantly enough I crept from between the rugs and out of the tent. To\ndress there was no need, for we slept in all our garments. He led me\nto the mouth of the cave and pointed northward. I looked. The night was\nvery dark; but far, far away appeared a faint patch of light upon the\nsky, such as might be caused by the reflection of a distant fire.\n\n\"What do you make of it?\" he asked anxiously.\n\n\"Nothing in particular,\" I answered, \"it may be anything. The moon--no,\nthere is none, dawn--no, it is too northerly, and it does not break for\nthree hours. Something burning, a house, or a funeral pyre, but how can\nthere be such things here? I give it up.\"\n\n\"I think it is a reflection, and that if we were on the peak we should\nsee the light which throws it,\" said Leo slowly.\n\n\"Yes, but we are not, and cannot get there in the dark.\"\n\n\"Then, Horace, we must spend a night there.\"\n\n\"It will be our last in this incarnation,\" I answered with a laugh,\n\"that is if it comes on to snow.\"\n\n\"We must risk it, or I will risk it. Look, the light has faded;\" and\nthere at least he was right, for undoubtedly it had. The night was as\nblack as pitch.\n\n\"Let's talk it over to-morrow,\" I said, and went back to the tent, for I\nwas sleepy and incredulous, but Leo sat on by the mouth of the cave.\n\nAt dawn I awoke and found breakfast already cooked.\n\n\"I must start early,\" Leo explained.\n\n\"Are you mad?\" I asked. \"How can we camp on that place?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but I am going. I must go, Horace.\"\n\n\"Which means that we both must go. But how about the yak?\"\n\n\"Where we can climb, it can follow,\" he answered.\n\nSo we strapped the tent and other baggage, including a good supply of\ncooked meat, upon the beast's back, and started. The tramp was long\nsince we were obliged to make some detours to avoid slopes of frozen\nsnow in which, on our previous ascents, we had cut footholds with an\naxe, for up these the laden animal could not clamber. Reaching the\nsummit at length, we dug a hole, and there pitched the tent, piling the\nexcavated snow about its sides. By this time it began to grow dark, and\nhaving descended into the tent, yak and all, we ate our food and waited.\n\nOh! what cold was that. The frost was fearful, and at this height a wind\nblew whose icy breath passed through all our wrappings, and seemed to\nburn our flesh beneath as though with hot irons. It was fortunate that\nwe had brought the yak, for without the warmth from its shaggy body I\nbelieve that we should have perished, even in our tent. For some hours\nwe watched, as indeed we must, since to sleep might mean to die, yet saw\nnothing save the lonely stars, and heard nothing in that awful silence,\nfor here even the wind made no noise as it slid across the snows.\nAccustomed as I was to such exposure, my faculties began to grow numb\nand my eyes to shut, when suddenly Leo said--\"Look, below the red star!\"\n\nI looked, and there high in the sky was the same curious glow which we\nhad seen upon the previous night. There was more than this indeed, for\nbeneath it, almost on a line with us and just above the crests of the\nintervening peaks, appeared a faint sheet of fire and revealed against\nit, something black. Whilst we watched, the fire widened, spread upwards\nand grew in power and intensity. Now against its flaming background the\nblack object became clearly visible, and lo! it was the top of a soaring\npillar surmounted by a loop. Yes, we could see its every outline. It was\nthe _crux ansata_, the Symbol of Life itself.\n\nThe symbol vanished, the fire sank. Again it blazed up more fiercely\nthan before and the loop appeared afresh, then once more disappeared.\nA third time the fire shone, and with such intensity, that no lightning\ncould surpass its brilliance. All around the heavens were lit up, and,\nthrough the black needle-shaped eye of the symbol, as from the flare of\na beacon, or the search-light of a ship, one fierce ray shot across the\nsea of mountain tops and the spaces of the desert, straight as an arrow\nto the lofty peak on which we lay. Yes, it lit upon the snow, staining\nit red, and upon the wild, white faces of us who watched, though to the\nright and left of us spread thick darkness. My compass lay before me on\nthe snow, and I could even see its needle; and beyond us the shape of\na white fox that had crept near, scenting food. Then it was gone as\nswiftly as it came. Gone too were the symbol and the veil of flame\nbehind it, only the glow lingered a little on the distant sky.\n\nFor awhile there was silence between us, then Leo said--\"Do you\nremember, Horace, when we lay upon the Rocking Stone where _her_\ncloak fell upon me--\" as he said the words the breath caught in his\nthroat--\"how the ray of light was sent to us in farewell, and to show us\na path of escape from the Place of Death? Now I think that it has been\nsent again in greeting to point out the path to the Place of Life where\nAyesha dwells, whom we have lost awhile.\"\n\n\"It may be so,\" I answered shortly, for the matter was beyond speech\nor argument, beyond wonder even. But I knew then, as I know now that\nwe were players in some mighty, predestined drama; that our parts were\nwritten and we must speak them, as our path was prepared and we must\ntread it to the end unknown. Fear and doubt were left behind, hope was\nsunk in certainty; the fore-shadowing visions of the night had found an\nactual fulfilment and the pitiful seed of the promise of her who died,\ngrowing unseen through all the cruel, empty years, had come to harvest.\n\nNo, we feared no more, not even when with the dawn rose the roaring\nwind, through which we struggled down the mountain slopes, as it would\nseem in peril of our lives at every step; not even as hour by hour we\nfought our way onwards through the whirling snow-storm, that made us\ndeaf and blind. For we knew that those lives were charmed. We could not\nsee or hear, yet we were led. Clinging to the yak, we struggled downward\nand homewards, till at length out of the turmoil and the gloom its\ninstinct brought us unharmed to the door of the monastery, where the old\nabbot embraced us in his joy, and the monks put up prayers of thanks.\nFor they were sure that we must be dead. Through such a storm, they\nsaid, no man had ever lived before.\n\nIt was still mid-winter, and oh! the awful weariness of those months of\nwaiting. In our hands was the key, yonder amongst those mountains lay\nthe door, but not yet might we set that key within its lock. For between\nus and these stretched the great desert, where the snow rolled like\nbillows, and until that snow melted we dared not attempt its passage. So\nwe sat in the monastery, and schooled our hearts to patience.\n\nStill even to these frozen wilds of Central Asia spring comes at last.\nOne evening the air felt warm, and that night there were only a few\ndegrees of frost. The next the clouds banked up, and in the morning\nnot snow was falling from them, but rain, and we found the old monks\npreparing their instruments of husbandry, as they said that the season\nof sowing was at hand. For three days it rained, while the snows melted\nbefore our eyes. On the fourth torrents of water were rushing down the\nmountain and the desert was once more brown and bare, though not for\nlong, for within another week it was carpeted with flowers. Then we knew\nthat the time had come to start.\n\n\"But whither go you? Whither go you?\" asked the old abbot in dismay.\n\"Are you not happy here? Do you not make great strides along the Path,\nas may be known by your pious conversation? Is not everything that we\nhave your own? Oh! why would you leave us?\"\n\n\"We are wanderers,\" we answered, \"and when we see mountains in front of\nus we must cross them.\"\n\nKou-en looked at us shrewdly, then asked--\"What do you seek beyond the\nmountains? And, my brethren, what merit is gathered by hiding the truth\nfrom an old man, for such concealments are separated from falsehoods but\nby the length of a single barleycorn. Tell me, that at least my prayers\nmay accompany you.\"\n\n\"Holy abbot,\" I said, \"awhile ago yonder in the library you made a\ncertain confession to us.\"\n\n\"Oh! remind me not of it,\" he said, holding up his hands. \"Why do you\nwish to torment me?\"\n\n\"Far be the thought from us, most kind friend and virtuous man,\" I\nanswered. \"But, as it chances, your story is very much our own, and we\nthink that we have experience of this same priestess.\"\n\n\"Speak on,\" he said, much interested.\n\nSo I told him the outlines of our tale; for an hour or more I told it\nwhile he sat opposite to us swaying his head like a tortoise and saying\nnothing. At length it was done.\n\n\"Now,\" I added, \"let the lamp of your wisdom shine upon our darkness. Do\nyou not find this story wondrous, or do you perchance think that we are\nliars?\"\n\n\"Brethren of the great monastery called the World,\" Kou-en answered\nwith his customary chuckle, \"why should I think you liars who, from the\nmoment my eyes fell upon you, knew you to be true men? Moreover, why\nshould I hold this tale so very wondrous? You have but stumbled upon\nthe fringe of a truth with which we have been acquainted for many, many\nages.\n\n\"Because in a vision she showed you this monastery, and led you to a\nspot beyond the mountains where she vanished, you hope that this woman\nwhom you saw die is re-incarnated yonder. Why not? In this there is\nnothing impossible to those who are instructed in the truth, though the\nlengthening of her last life was strange and contrary to experience.\nDoubtless you will find her there as you expect, and doubtless her\n_khama_, or identity, is the same as that which in some earlier life of\nhers once brought me to sin.\n\n\"Only be not mistaken, she is no immortal; nothing is immortal. She is\nbut a being held back by her own pride, her own greatness if you will,\nupon the path towards Nirvana. That pride will be humbled, as already it\nhas been humbled; that brow of majesty shall be sprinkled with the dust\nof change and death, that sinful spirit must be purified by sorrows and\nby separations. Brother Leo, if you win her, it will be but to lose, and\nthen the ladder must be reclimbed. Brother Holly, for you as for me loss\nis our only gain, since thereby we are spared much woe. Oh! bide here\nand pray with me. Why dash yourselves against a rock? Why labour to pour\nwater into a broken jar whence it must sink into the sands of profitless\nexperience, and there be wasted, whilst you remain athirst?\"\n\n\"Water makes the sand fertile,\" I answered. \"Where water falls, life\ncomes, and sorrow is the seed of joy.\"\n\n\"Love is the law of life,\" broke in Leo; \"without love there is no\nlife. I seek love that I may live. I believe that all these things are\nordained to an end which we do not know. Fate draws me on--I fulfil my\nfate----\"\n\n\"And do but delay your freedom. Yet I will not argue with you, brother,\nwho must follow your own road. See now, what has this woman, this\npriestess of a false faith if she be so still, brought you in the past?\nOnce in another life, or so I understand your story, you were sworn to\na certain nature-goddess, who was named Isis, were you not, and to her\nalone? Then a woman tempted you, and you fled with her afar. And there\nwhat found you? The betrayed and avenging goddess who slew you, or if\nnot the goddess, one who had drunk of her wisdom and was the minister\nof her vengeance. Having that wisdom this minister--woman or evil\nspirit--refused to die because she had learned to love you, but waited\nknowing that in your next life she would find you again, as indeed she\nwould have done more swiftly in Devachan had she died without living on\nalone in so much misery. And she found you, and she died, or seemed to\ndie, and now she is re-born, as she must be, and doubtless you will\nmeet once more, and again there must come misery. Oh! my friends, go not\nacross the mountains; bide here with me and lament your sins.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" answered Leo, \"we are sworn to a tryst, and we do not break our\nword.\"\n\n\"Then, brethren, go keep your tryst, and when you have reaped its\nharvest think upon my sayings, for I am sure that the wine you crush\nfrom the vintage of your desire will run red like blood, and that in its\ndrinking you shall find neither forgetfulness nor peace. Made blind by\na passion of which well I know the sting and power, you seek to add a\nfair-faced evil to your lives, thinking that from this unity there shall\nbe born all knowledge and great joy.\n\n\"Rather should you desire to live alone in holiness until at length your\nseparate lives are merged and lost in the Good Unspeakable, the eternal\nbliss that lies in the last Nothingness. Ah! you do not believe me now;\nyou shake your heads and smile; yet a day will dawn, it may be after\nmany incarnations, when you shall bow them in the dust and weep, saying\nto me, 'Brother Kou-en, yours were the words of wisdom, ours the deeds\nof foolishness;'\" and with a deep sigh the old man turned and left us.\n\n\"A cheerful faith, truly,\" said Leo, looking after him, \"to dwell\nthrough aeons in monotonous misery in order that consciousness may be\nswallowed up at last in some void and formless abstraction called the\n'Utter Peace.' I would rather take my share of a bad world and keep my\nhope of a better. Also I do not think that he knows anything of Ayesha\nand her destiny.\"\n\n\"So would I,\" I answered, \"though perhaps he is right after all. Who can\ntell? Moreover, what is the use of reasoning? Leo, we have no choice;\nwe follow our fate. To what that fate may lead us we shall learn in due\nseason.\"\n\nThen we went to rest, for it was late, though I found little sleep that\nnight. The warnings of the ancient abbot, good and learned man as he\nwas, full also of ripe experience and of the foresighted wisdom that\nis given to such as he, oppressed me deeply. He promised us sorrow and\nbloodshed beyond the mountains, ending in death and rebirths full of\nmisery. Well, it might be so, but no approaching sufferings could stay\nour feet. And even if they could, they should not, since to see her face\nagain I was ready to brave them all. And if this was my case what must\nbe that of Leo!\n\nA strange theory that of Kou-en's, that Ayesha was the goddess in\nold Egypt to whom Kallikrates was priest, or at the least her\nrepresentative. That the royal Amenartas, with whom he fled, seduced him\nfrom the goddess to whom he was sworn. That this goddess incarnate\nin Ayesha--or using the woman Ayesha and her passions as her\ninstruments--was avenged upon them both at Kor, and that there in an\nafter age the bolt she shot fell back upon her own head.\n\nWell, I had often thought as much myself. Only I was sure that _She_\nherself could be no actual divinity, though she might be a manifestation\nof one, a priestess, a messenger, charged to work its will, to avenge or\nto reward, and yet herself a human soul, with hopes and passions to be\nsatisfied, and a destiny to fulfil. In truth, writing now, when all is\npast and done with, I find much to confirm me in, and little to turn me\nfrom that theory, since life and powers of a quality which are more than\nhuman do not alone suffice to make a soul divine. On the other hand,\nhowever, it must be borne in mind that on one occasion at any rate,\nAyesha did undoubtedly suggest that in the beginning she was \"a daughter\nof Heaven,\" and that there were others, notably the old Shaman Simbri,\nwho seemed to take it for granted that her origin was supernatural. But\nof all these things I hope to speak in their season.\n\nMeanwhile what lay beyond the mountains? Should we find her there who\nheld the sceptre and upon earth wielded the power of the outraged Isis,\nand with her, that other woman who wrought the wrong? And if so, would\nthe dread, inhuman struggle reach its climax around the person of the\nsinful priest? In a few months, a few days even, we might begin to know.\n\nThrilled by this thought at length I fell asleep.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE AVALANCHE\n\nOn the morning of the second day from that night the sunrise found us\nalready on our path across the desert. There, nearly a mile behind us,\nwe could see the ruined statue of Buddha seated in front of the ancient\nmonastery, and in that clear atmosphere could even distinguish the bent\nform of our friend, the old abbot, Kou-en, leaning against it until we\nwere quite lost to sight. All the monks had wept when we parted from\nthem, and Kou-en even more bitterly than the rest, for he had learned to\nlove us.\n\n\"I am grieved,\" he said, \"much grieved, which indeed I should not be,\nfor such emotion partakes of sin. Yet I find comfort, for I know well\nthat although I must soon leave this present life, yet we shall meet\nagain in many future incarnations, and after you have put away these\nfollies, together tread the path to perfect peace. Now take with you my\nblessings and my prayers and begone, forgetting not that should you live\nto return\"--and he shook his head, doubtfully--\"here you will be ever\nwelcome.\"\n\nSo we embraced him and went sorrowfully.\n\nIt will be remembered that when the mysterious light fell upon us on the\npeak I had my compass with me and was able roughly to take its bearings.\nFor lack of any better guide we now followed these bearings, travelling\nalmost due north-east, for in that direction had shone the fire. All\nday in the most beautiful weather we marched across the flower-strewn\ndesert, seeing nothing except bunches of game and one or two herds of\nwild asses which had come down from the mountains to feed upon the new\ngrass. As evening approached we shot an antelope and made our camp--for\nwe had brought the yak and a tent with us--among some tamarisk scrub, of\nwhich the dry stems furnished us with fuel. Nor did we lack for water,\nsince by scraping in the sand soaked with melted snow, we found plenty\nof fair quality. So that night we supped in luxury upon tea and antelope\nmeat, which indeed we were glad to have, as it spared our little store\nof dried provisions.\n\nThe next morning we ascertained our position as well as we could, and\nestimated that we had crossed about a quarter of the desert, a guess\nwhich proved very accurate, for on the evening of the fourth day of our\njourney we reached the bottom slopes of the opposing mountains, without\nhaving experienced either accident or fatigue. As Leo said, things were\n\"going like clockwork,\" but I reminded him that a good start often meant\na bad finish. Nor was I wrong, for now came our hardships. To begin\nwith, the mountains proved to be exceeding high; it took us two days\nto climb their lower slopes. Also the heat of the sun had softened the\nsnow, which made walking through it laborious, whilst, accustomed\nthough we were to such conditions through long years of travelling, its\ncontinual glitter affected our eyes.\n\nThe morning of the seventh day found us in the mouth of a defile which\nwound away into the heart of the mountains. As it seemed the only\npossible path, we followed it, and were much cheered to discover that\nhere must once have run a road. Not that we could see any road, indeed,\nfor everything was buried in snow. But that one lay beneath our feet we\nwere certain, since, although we marched along the edge of precipices,\nour path, however steep, was always flat; moreover, the rock upon one\nside of it had often been scarped by the hand of man. Of this there\ncould be no doubt, for as the snow did not cling here, we saw the tool\nmarks upon its bare surface.\n\nAlso we came to several places where galleries had been built out from\nthe mountain side, by means of beams let into it, as is still a common\npractice in Thibet. These beams of course had long since rotted away,\nleaving a gulf between us and the continuation of the path. When we met\nwith such gaps we were forced to go back and make a detour round or over\nsome mountain; but although much delayed thereby, as it happened, we\nalways managed to regain the road, if not without difficulty and danger.\n\nWhat tried us more--for here our skill and experience as mountaineers\ncould not help us--was the cold at night, obliged as we were to camp\nin the severe frost at a great altitude, and to endure through the long\nhours of darkness penetrating and icy winds, which soughed ceaselessly\ndown the pass.\n\nAt length on the tenth day we reached the end of the defile, and as\nnight was falling, camped there in the most bitter cold. Those were\nmiserable hours, for now we had no fuel with which to boil water, and\nmust satisfy our thirst by eating frozen snow, while our eyes smarted\nso sorely that we could not sleep, and notwithstanding all our wraps and\nthe warmth that we gathered from the yak in the little tent, the cold\ncaused our teeth to chatter like castanets.\n\nThe dawn came, and, after it, the sunrise. We crept from the tent, and\nleaving it standing awhile, dragged our stiffened limbs a hundred yards\nor so to a spot where the defile took a turn, in order that we might\nthaw in the rays of the sun, which at that hour could not reach us where\nwe had camped.\n\nLeo was round it first, and I heard him utter an exclamation. In a few\nseconds I reached his side, and lo! before us lay our Promised Land.\n\nFar beneath us, ten thousand feet at least--for it must be remembered\nthat we viewed it from the top of a mountain--it stretched away and away\ntill its distances met the horizon. In character it was quite flat, an\nalluvial plain that probably, in some primeval age, had been the bottom\nof one of the vast lakes of which a number exist in Central Asia, most\nof them now in process of desiccation. One object only relieved this\ndreary flatness, a single, snow-clad, and gigantic mountain, of which\neven at that distance--for it was very far from us--we could clearly see\nthe outline. Indeed we could see more, for from its rounded crest rose a\ngreat plume of smoke, showing that it was an active volcano, and on the\nhither lip of the crater an enormous pillar of rock, whereof the top was\nformed to the shape of a loop.\n\nYes, there it stood before us, that symbol of our vision which we had\nsought these many years, and at the sight of it our hearts beat fast and\nour breath came quickly. We noted at once that although we had not seen\nit during our passage of the mountains, since the peaks ahead and the\nrocky sides of the defile hid it from view, so great was its height that\nit overtopped the tallest of them. This made it clear to us how it came\nto be possible that the ray of light passing through the loop could fall\nupon the highest snows of that towering pinnacle which we had climbed\nupon the further side of the desert.\n\nAlso now we were certain of the cause of that ray, for the smoke behind\nthe loop explained this mystery. Doubtless, at times when the volcano\nwas awake, that smoke must be replaced by flame, emitting light of\nfearful intensity, and this light it was that reached us, concentrated\nand directed by the loop.\n\nFor the rest we thought that about thirty miles away we could make out a\nwhite-roofed town set upon a mound, situated among trees upon the banks\nof a wide river, which flowed across the plain. Also it was evident that\nthis country had a large population who cultivated the soil, for by\nthe aid of a pair of field glasses, one of our few remaining and most\ncherished possessions, we could see the green of springing crops pierced\nby irrigation canals and the lines of trees that marked the limits of\nthe fields.\n\nYes, there before us stretched the Promised Land, and there rose the\nmystic Mount, so that all we had to do was to march down the snow slopes\nand enter it where we would.\n\nThus we thought in our folly, little guessing what lay before us, what\nterrors and weary suffering we must endure before we stood at length\nbeneath the shadow of the Symbol of Life.\n\nOur fatigues forgotten, we returned to the tent, hastily swallowed some\nof our dried food, which we washed down with lumps of snow that gave us\ntoothache and chilled us inside, but which thirst compelled us to eat,\ndragged the poor yak to its feet, loaded it up, and started.\n\nAll this while, so great was our haste and so occupied were each of\nus with our own thoughts that, if my memory serves me, we scarcely\ninterchanged a word. Down the snow slopes we marched swiftly and without\nhesitation, for here the road was marked for us by means of pillars of\nrock set opposite to one another at intervals. These pillars we observed\nwith satisfaction, for they told us that we were still upon a highway\nwhich led to the Promised Land.\n\nYet, as we could not help noting, it was one which seemed to have gone\nout of use, since with the exception of a few wild-sheep tracks and the\nspoor of some bears and mountain foxes, not a single sign of beast or\nman could we discover. This, however, was to be explained, we reflected,\nby the fact that doubtless the road was only used in the summer season.\nOr perhaps the inhabitants of the country were now stay-at-home people\nwho never travelled it at all.\n\nThose slopes were longer than we thought; indeed, when darkness closed\nin we had not reached the foot of them. So we were obliged to spend\nanother night in the snow, pitching our tent in the shelter of\nan over-hanging rock. As we had descended many thousand feet, the\ntemperature proved, fortunately, a little milder; indeed, I do not\nthink that there were more than eighteen or twenty degrees of frost that\nnight. Also here and there the heat of the sun had melted the snow in\nsecluded places, so that we were able to find water to drink, while the\nyak could fill its poor old stomach with dead-looking mountain mosses,\nwhich it seemed to think better than nothing.\n\nAgain, the still dawn came, throwing its red garment over the lonesome,\nendless mountains, and we dragged ourselves to our numbed feet, ate some\nof our remaining food, and started onwards. Now we could no longer see\nthe country beneath, for it and even the towering volcano were hidden\nfrom us by an intervening ridge that seemed to be pierced by a single\nnarrow gulley, towards which we headed. Indeed, as the pillars showed\nus, thither ran the buried road. By mid-day it appeared quite close to\nus, and we tramped on in feverish haste. As it chanced, however, there\nwas no need to hurry, for an hour later we learned the truth.\n\nBetween us and the mouth of the gulley rose, or rather sank, a sheer\nprecipice that was apparently three or four hundred feet in depth, and\nat its foot we could hear the sound of water.\n\nRight to the edge of this precipice ran the path, for one of the stone\npillars stood upon its extreme brink, and yet how could a road descend\nsuch a place as that? We stared aghast; then a possible solution\noccurred to us.\n\n\"Don't you see,\" said Leo, with a hollow laugh, \"the gulf has opened\nsince this track was used: volcanic action probably.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, or perhaps there was a wooden bridge or stairway which has\nrotted. It does not matter. We must find another path, that is all,\" I\nanswered as cheerfully as I could.\n\n\"Yes, and soon,\" he said, \"if we do not wish to stop here for ever.\"\n\nSo we turned to the right and marched along the edge of the precipice\ntill, a mile or so away, we came to a small glacier, of which the\nsurface was sprinkled with large stones frozen into its substance. This\nglacier hung down the face of the cliff like a petrified waterfall, but\nwhether or no it reached the foot we could not discover. At any rate,\nto think of attempting its descent seemed out of the question. From this\npoint onwards we could see that the precipice increased in depth and far\nas the eye could reach was absolutely sheer.\n\nSo we went back again and searched to the left of our road. Here the\nmountains receded, so that above us rose a mighty, dazzling slope of\nsnow and below us lay that same pitiless, unclimbable gulf. As the light\nbegan to fade we perceived, half a mile or more in front a bare-topped\nhillock of rock, which stood on the verge of the precipice, and hurried\nto it, thinking that from its crest we might be able to discover a way\nof descent.\n\nWhen at length we had struggled to the top, it was about a hundred and\nfifty feet high; what we did discover was that, here also, as beyond the\nglacier, the gulf was infinitely deeper than at the spot where the road\nended, so deep indeed that we could not see its bottom, although from it\ncame the sound of roaring water. Moreover, it was quite half a mile in\nwidth.\n\nWhilst we stared round us the sinking sun vanished behind a mountain\nand, the sky being heavy, the light went out like that of a candle. Now\nthe ascent of this hillock had proved so steep, especially at one place,\nwhere we were obliged to climb a sort of rock ladder, that we scarcely\ncared to attempt to struggle down it again in that gloom. Therefore,\nremembering that there was little to choose between the top of this\nknoll and the snow plain at its foot in the matter of temperature or\nother conveniences, and being quite exhausted, we determined to spend\nthe night upon it, thereby, as we were to learn, saving our lives.\n\nUnloading the yak, we pitched our tent under the lee of the topmost knob\nof rock and ate a couple of handfuls of dried fish and corn-cake. This\nwas the last of the food that we had brought with us from the Lamasery,\nand we reflected with dismay that unless we could shoot something, our\ncommissariat was now represented by the carcass of our old friend the\nyak. Then we wrapped ourselves up in our thick rugs and fur garments and\nforgot our miseries in sleep.\n\nIt cannot have been long before daylight when we were awakened by a\nsudden and terrific sound like the boom of a great cannon, followed by\nthousands of other sounds, which might be compared to the fusillade of\nmusketry.\n\n\"Great Heaven! What is that?\" I said.\n\nWe crawled from the tent, but as yet could see nothing, whilst the yak\nbegan to low in a terrified manner. But if we could not see we could\nhear and feel. The booming and cracking had ceased, and was followed by\na soft, grinding noise, the most sickening sound, I think, to which\nI ever listened. This was accompanied by a strange, steady, unnatural\nwind, which seemed to press upon us as water presses. Then the dawn\nbroke and we saw.\n\nThe mountain-side was moving down upon us in a vast avalanche of snow.\n\nOh! what a sight was that. On from the crest of the precipitous slopes\nabove, two miles and more away, it came, a living thing, rolling,\nsliding, gliding; piling itself in long, leaping waves, hollowing itself\ninto cavernous valleys, like a tempest-driven sea, whilst above its\nsurface hung a powdery cloud of frozen spray.\n\nAs we watched, clinging to each other terrified, the first of these\nwaves struck our hill, causing the mighty mass of solid rock to quiver\nlike a yacht beneath the impact of an ocean roller, or an aspen in\na sudden rush of wind. It struck and slowly separated, then with a\nmajestic motion flowed like water over the edge of the precipice on\neither side, and fell with a thudding sound into the unmeasured depths\nbeneath. And this was but a little thing, a mere forerunner, for after\nit, with a slow, serpentine movement, rolled the body of the avalanche.\n\nIt came in combers, it came in level floods. It piled itself against our\nhill, yes, to within fifty feet of the head of it, till we thought that\neven that rooted rock must be torn from its foundations and hurled like\na pebble to the deeps beneath. And the turmoil of it all! The screaming\nof the blast caused by the compression of the air, the dull, continuous\nthudding of the fall of millions of tons of snow as they rushed through\nspace and ended their journey in the gulf.\n\nNor was this the worst of it, for as the deep snows above thinned, great\nboulders that had been buried beneath them, perhaps for centuries, were\nloosened from their resting-places and began to thunder down the hill.\nAt first they moved slowly, throwing up the hard snow around them as the\nprow of a ship throws foam. Then gathering momentum, they sprang into\nthe air with leaps such as those of shells ricocheting upon water, till\nin the end, singing and hurtling, many of them rushed past and even over\nus to vanish far beyond. Some indeed struck our little mountain with the\nforce of shot fired from the great guns of a battle-ship, and shattered\nthere, or if they fell upon its side, tore away tons of rock and passed\nwith them into the chasm like a meteor surrounded by its satellites.\nIndeed, no bombardment devised and directed by man could have been half\nso terrible or, had there been anything to destroy, half so destructive.\n\nThe scene was appalling in its unchained and resistless might evolved\nsuddenly from the completest calm. There in the lap of the quiet\nmountains, looked down upon by the peaceful, tender sky, the powers\nhidden in the breast of Nature were suddenly set free, and, companioned\nby whirlwinds and all the terrifying majesty of sound, loosed upon the\nheads of us two human atoms.\n\nAt the first rush of snow we had leapt back behind our protecting peak\nand, lying at full length upon the ground, gripped it and clung there,\nfearing lest the wind should whirl us to the abyss. Long ago our tent\nhad gone like a dead leaf in an autumn gale, and at times it seemed as\nif we must follow.\n\nThe boulders hurtled over and past us; one of them, fell full upon the\nlittle peak, shattering its crest and bursting into fragments, which\nfled away, each singing its own wild song. We were not touched, but\nwhen we looked behind us it was to see the yak, which had risen in its\nterror, lying dead and headless. Then in our fear we lay still, waiting\nfor the end, and wondering dimly whether we should be buried in the\nsurging snow or swept away with the hill, or crushed by the flying\nrocks, or lifted and lost in the hurricane.\n\nHow long did it last? We never knew. It may have been ten minutes or\ntwo hours, for in such a scene time loses its proportion. Only we became\naware that the wind had fallen, while the noise of grinding snow and\nhurtling boulders ceased. Very cautiously we gained our feet and looked.\n\nIn front of us was sheer mountain side, for a depth of over two miles,\nthe width of about a thousand yards, which had been covered with many\nfeet of snow, was now bare rock. Piled up against the face of our hill,\nalmost to its summit, lay a tongue of snow, pressed to the consistency\nof ice and spotted with boulders that had lodged there. The peak itself\nwas torn and shattered, so that it revealed great gleaming surfaces\nand pits, in which glittered mica, or some other mineral. The vast gulf\nbehind was half filled with the avalanche and its debris. But for\nthe rest, it seemed as though nothing had happened, for the sun shone\nsweetly overhead and the solemn snows reflected its rays from the sides\nof a hundred hills. And we had endured it all and were still alive; yes,\nand unhurt.\n\nBut what a position was ours! We dared not attempt to descend the mount,\nlest we should sink into the loose snow and be buried there. Moreover,\nall along the breadth of the path of the avalanche boulders from time to\ntime still thundered down the rocky slope, and with them came patches of\nsnow that had been left behind by the big slide, small in themselves,\nit is true, but each of them large enough to kill a hundred men. It\nwas obvious, therefore, that until these conditions changed, or death\nreleased us, we must abide where we were upon the crest of the hillock.\n\nSo there we sat, foodless and frightened, wondering what our old friend\nKou-en would say if he could see us now. By degrees hunger mastered all\nour other sensations and we began to turn longing eyes upon the headless\nbody of the yak.\n\n\"Let's skin him,\" said Leo, \"it will be something to do, and we shall\nwant his hide to-night.\"\n\nSo with affection, and even reverence, we performed this office for the\ndead companion of our journeyings, rejoicing the while that it was not\nwe who had brought him to his end. Indeed, long residence among peoples\nwho believed fully that the souls of men could pass into, or were risen\nfrom, the bodies of animals, had made us a little superstitious on this\nmatter. It would be scarcely pleasant, we reflected, in some future\nincarnation, to find our faithful friend clad in human form and to hear\nhim bitterly reproach us for his murder.\n\nBeing dead, however, these arguments did not apply to eating him, as we\nwere sure he would himself acknowledge. So we cut off little bits of\nhis flesh and, rolling them in snow till they looked as though they were\nnicely floured, hunger compelling us, swallowed them at a gulp. It was a\ndisgusting meal and we felt like cannibals: but what could we do?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE GLACIER\n\nEven that day came to an end at last, and after a few more lumps of\nyak, our tent being gone, we drew his hide over us and rested as best\nwe could, knowing that at least we had no more avalanches to fear. That\nnight it froze sharply, so that had it not been for the yak's hide and\nthe other rugs and garments, which fortunately we were wearing when the\nsnow-slide began, it would, I think, have gone hard with us. As it was,\nwe suffered a great deal.\n\n\"Horace,\" said Leo at the dawn, \"I am going to leave this. If we have\nto die, I would rather do so moving; but I don't believe that we shall\ndie.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" I said, \"let us start. If the snow won't bear us now, it\nnever will.\"\n\nSo we tied up our rugs and the yak's hide in two bundles and, having cut\noff some more of the frozen meat, began our descent. Now, although the\nmount was under two hundred feet high, its base, fortunately for us--for\notherwise it must have been swept away by the mighty pressure of the\navalanche--was broad, so that there was a long expanse of piled-up snow\nbetween us and the level ground.\n\nSince, owing to the overhanging conformation of the place, it was quite\nimpossible for us to descend in front where pressure had made the snow\nhard as stone, we were obliged to risk a march over the looser material\nupon its flank. As there was nothing to be gained by waiting, off\nwe went, Leo leading and step by step trying the snow. To our joy we\ndiscovered that the sharp night frost had so hardened its surface that\nit would support us. About half way down, however, where the pressure\nhad been less, it became much softer, so that we were forced to lie\nupon our faces, which enabled us to distribute our weight over a larger\nsurface, and thus slither gently down the hill.\n\nAll went well until we were within twenty paces of the bottom, where\nwe must cross a soft mound formed of the powdery dust thrown off by the\navalanche in its rush. Leo slipped over safely, but I, following a yard\nor two to his right, of a sudden felt the hard crust yield beneath\nme. An ill-judged but quite natural flounder and wriggle, such as a\nnewly-landed flat-fish gives upon the sand, completed the mischief, and\nwith one piercing but swiftly stifled yell, I vanished.\n\nAny one who has ever sunk in deep water will know that the sensation\nis not pleasant, but I can assure him that to go through the same\nexperience in soft snow is infinitely worse; mud alone could surpass its\nterrors. Down I went, and down, till at length I seemed to reach a rock\nwhich alone saved me from disappearing for ever. Now I felt the snow\nclosing above me and with it came darkness and a sense of suffocation.\nSo soft was the drift, however, that before I was overcome I contrived\nwith my arms to thrust away the powdery dust from about my head, thus\nforming a little hollow into which air filtered slowly. Getting my hands\nupon the stone, I strove to rise, but could not, the weight upon me was\ntoo great.\n\nThen I abandoned hope and prepared to die. The process proved not\naltogether unpleasant. I did not see visions from my past life as\ndrowning men are supposed to do, but--and this shows how strong was her\nempire over me--my mind flew back to Ayesha. I seemed to behold her and\na man at her side, standing over me in some dark, rocky gulf. She was\nwrapped in a long travelling cloak, and her lovely eyes were wild with\nfear. I rose to salute her, and make report, but she cried in a fierce,\nconcentrated voice--\"What evil thing has happened here? Thou livest;\nthen where is my lord Leo? Speak, man, and say where thou hast hid my\nlord--or die.\"\n\nThe vision was extraordinarily real and vivid, I remember, and,\nconsidered in connection with a certain subsequent event, in all ways\nmost remarkable, but it passed as swiftly as it came.\n\nThen my senses left me.\n\nI saw a light again. I heard a voice, that of Leo. \"Horace,\" he cried,\n\"Horace, hold fast to the stock of the rifle.\" Something was thrust\nagainst my outstretched hand. I gripped it despairingly, and there came\na strain. It was useless, I did not move. Then, bethinking me, I drew\nup my legs and by chance or the mercy of Heaven, I know not, got my\nfeet against a ridge of the rock on which I was lying. Again I felt the\nstrain, and thrust with all my might. Of a sudden the snow gave, and out\nof that hole I shot like a fox from its earth.\n\nI struck something. It was Leo straining at the gun, and I knocked him\nbackwards. Then down the steep slope we rolled, landing at length upon\nthe very edge of the precipice. I sat up, drawing in the air with great\ngasps, and oh! how sweet it was. My eyes fell upon my hand, and I saw\nthat the veins stood out on the back of it, black as ink and large as\ncords. Clearly I must have been near my end.\n\n\"How long was I in there?\" I gasped to Leo, who sat at my side, wiping\noff the sweat that ran from his face in streams.\n\n\"Don't know. Nearly twenty minutes, I should think.\"\n\n\"Twenty minutes! It seemed like twenty centuries. How did you get me\nout? You could not stand upon the drift dust.\"\n\n\"No; I lay upon the yak skin where the snow was harder and tunnelled\ntowards you through the powdery stuff with my hands, for I knew where\nyou had sunk and it was not far off. At last I saw your finger tips;\nthey were so blue that for a few seconds I took them for rock, but\nthrust the butt of the rifle against them. Luckily you still had life\nenough to catch hold of it, and you know the rest. Were we not both very\nstrong, it could never have been done.\"\n\n\"Thank you, old fellow,\" I said simply.\n\n\"Why should you thank me?\" he asked with one of his quick smiles. \"Do\nyou suppose that I wished to continue this journey alone? Come, if you\nhave got your breath, let us be getting on. You have been sleeping in a\ncold bed and want exercise. Look, my rifle is broken and yours is\nlost in the snow. Well, it will save us the trouble of carrying the\ncartridges,\" and he laughed drearily.\n\nThen we began our march, heading for the spot where the road ended four\nmiles or so away, for to go forward seemed useless. In due course we\nreached it safely. Once a mass of snow as large as a church swept down\njust in front of us, and once a great boulder loosened from the mountain\nrushed at us suddenly like an attacking lion, or the stones thrown\nby Polyphemus at the ship of Odysseus, and, leaping over our heads,\nvanished with an angry scream into the depths beneath. But we took\nlittle heed of these things: our nerves were deadened, and no danger\nseemed to affect them.\n\nThere was the end of the road, and there were our own footprints and the\nimpress of the yak's hoofs in the snow. The sight of them affected me,\nfor it seemed strange that we should have lived to look upon them\nagain. We stared over the edge of the precipice. Yes, it was sheer and\nabsolutely unclimbable.\n\n\"Come to the glacier,\" said Leo.\n\nSo we went on to it, and scrambling a little way down its root, made an\nexamination. Here, so far as we could judge, the cliff was about four\nhundred feet deep. But whether or no the tongue of ice reached to the\nfoot of it we were unable to tell, since about two thirds of the way\ndown it arched inwards, like the end of a bent bow, and the conformation\nof the overhanging rocks on either side was such that we could not see\nwhere it terminated. We climbed back again and sat down, and despair\ntook hold of us, bitter, black despair.\n\n\"What are we to do?\" I asked. \"In front of us death. Behind us death,\nfor how can we recross those mountains without food or guns to shoot\nit with? Here death, for we must sit and starve. We have striven and\nfailed. Leo, our end is at hand. Only a miracle can save us.\"\n\n\"A miracle,\" he answered. \"Well, what was it that led us to the top of\nthe mount so that we were able to escape the avalanche? And what was it\nwhich put that rock in your way as you sank into the bed of dust, and\ngave me wit and strength to dig you out of your grave of snow? And what\nis it that has preserved us through seventeen years of dangers such as\nfew men have known and lived? Some directing Power. Some Destiny that\nwill accomplish itself in us. Why should the Power cease to guide? Why\nshould the Destiny be baulked at last?\"\n\nHe paused, then added fiercely, \"I tell you, Horace, that even if we had\nguns, food, and yaks, I would not turn back upon our spoor, since to do\nso would prove me a coward and unworthy of her. I will go on.\"\n\n\"How?\" I asked.\n\n\"By that road,\" and he pointed to the glacier.\n\n\"It is a road to death!\"\n\n\"Well, if so, Horace, it would seem that in this land men find life in\ndeath, or so they believe. If we die now, we shall die travelling our\npath, and in the country where we perish we may be born again. At least\nI am determined, so you must choose.\"\n\n\"I have chosen long ago. Leo, we began this journey together and we will\nend it together. Perhaps Ayesha knows and will help us,\" and I laughed\ndrearily. \"If not--come, we are wasting time.\"\n\nThen we took counsel, and the end of it was that we cut a skin rug and\nthe yak's tough hide into strips and knotted these together into two\nserviceable ropes, which we fastened about our middles, leaving one end\nloose, for we thought that they might help us in our descent.\n\nNext we bound fragments of another skin rug about our legs and knees\nto protect them from the chafing of the ice and rocks, and for the same\nreason put on our thick leather gloves. This done, we took the remainder\nof our gear and heavy robes and, having placed stones in them, threw\nthem over the brink of the precipice, trusting to find them again,\nshould we ever reach its foot. Now our preparations were complete,\nand it was time for us to start upon perhaps one of the most desperate\njourneys ever undertaken by men of their own will.\n\nYet we stayed a little, looking at each other in piteous fashion, for\nwe could not speak. Only we embraced, and I confess, I think I wept\na little. It all seemed so sad and hopeless, these longings endured\nthrough many years, these perpetual, weary travellings, and now--the\nend. I could not bear to think of that splendid man, my ward, my most\ndear friend, the companion of my life, who stood before me so full of\nbeauty and of vigour, but who must within a few short minutes be turned\ninto a heap of quivering, mangled flesh. For myself it did not matter.\nI was old, it was time that I should die. I had lived innocently, if it\nwere innocent to follow this lovely image, this Siren of the caves, who\nlured us on to doom.\n\nNo, I don't think that I thought of myself then, but I thought a great\ndeal of Leo, and when I saw his determined face and flashing eyes as he\nnerved himself to the last endeavour, I was proud of him. So in broken\naccents I blessed him and wished him well through all the aeons, praying\nthat I might be his companion to the end of time. In few words and short\nhe thanked me and gave me back my blessing. Then he muttered--\"Come.\"\n\nSo side by side we began the terrible descent. At first it was easy\nenough, although a slip would have hurled us to eternity. But we were\nstrong and skilful, accustomed to such places moreover, and made none.\nAbout a quarter of the way down we paused, standing upon a great boulder\nthat was embedded in the ice, and, turning round cautiously, leaned our\nbacks against the glacier and looked about us. Truly it was a horrible\nplace, almost sheer, nor did we learn much, for beneath us, a hundred\nand twenty feet or more, the projecting bend cut off our view of what\nlay below.\n\nSo, feeling that our nerves would not bear a prolonged contemplation of\nthat dizzy gulf, once more we set our faces to the ice and proceeded on\nthe downward climb. Now matters were more difficult, for the stones were\nfewer and once or twice we must slide to reach them, not knowing if we\nshould ever stop again. But the ropes which we threw over the angles\nof the rocks, or salient points of ice, letting ourselves down by their\nhelp and drawing them after us when we reached the next foothold, saved\nus from disaster.\n\nThus at length we came to the bend, which was more than half way down\nthe precipice, being, so far as I could judge, about two hundred and\nfifty feet from its lip, and say one hundred and fifty from the darksome\nbottom of the narrow gulf. Here were no stones, but only some rough ice,\non which we sat to rest.\n\n\"We must look,\" said Leo presently.\n\nBut the question was, how to do this. Indeed, there was only one way,\nto hang over the bend and discover what lay below. We read each other's\nthought without the need of words, and I made a motion as though I would\nstart.\n\n\"No,\" said Leo, \"I am younger and stronger than you. Come, help me,\" and\nhe began to fasten the end of his rope to a strong, projecting point of\nice. \"Now,\" he said, \"hold my ankles.\"\n\nIt seemed an insanity, but there was nothing else to be done, so, fixing\nmy heels in a niche, I grasped them and slowly he slid forward till his\nbody vanished to the middle. What he saw does not matter, for I saw it\nall afterwards, but what happened was that suddenly all his great weight\ncame upon my arms with such a jerk that his ankles were torn from my\ngrip.\n\nOr, who knows! perhaps in my terror I loosed them, obeying the natural\nimpulse which prompts a man to save his own life. If so, may I be\nforgiven, but had I held on, I must have been jerked into the abyss.\nThen the rope ran out and remained taut.\n\n\"Leo!\" I screamed, \"Leo!\" and I heard a muffled voice saying, as I\nthought, \"Come.\" What it really said was--\"Don't come.\" But indeed--and\nmay it go to my credit--I did not pause to think, but face outwards,\njust as I was sitting, began to slide and scramble down the ice.\n\nIn two seconds I had reached the curve, in three I was over it. Beneath\nwas what I can only describe as a great icicle broken off short, and\nseparated from the cliff by about four yards of space. This icicle was\nnot more than fifteen feet in length and sloped outwards, so that my\ndescent was not sheer. Moreover, at the end of it the trickling of\nwater, or some such accident, had worn away the ice, leaving a little\nledge as broad, perhaps, as a man's hand. There were roughnesses on the\nsurface below the curve, upon which my clothing caught, also I gripped\nthem desperately with my fingers. Thus it came about that I slid down\nquite gently and, my heels landing upon the little ledge, remained\nalmost upright, with outstretched arms--like a person crucified to a\ncross of ice.\n\nThen I saw everything, and the sight curdled the blood within my veins.\nHanging to the rope, four or five feet below the broken point, was Leo,\nout of reach of it, and out of reach of the cliff; as he hung turning\nslowly round and round, much as--for in a dreadful, inconsequent fashion\nthe absurd similarity struck me even then--a joint turns before the\nfire. Below yawned the black gulf, and at the bottom of it, far, far\nbeneath, appeared a faint, white sheet of snow. That is what I saw.\n\nThink of it! Think of it! I crucified upon the ice, my heels resting\nupon a little ledge; my fingers grasping excrescences on which a bird\ncould scarcely have found a foothold; round and below me dizzy space.\nTo climb back whence I came was impossible, to stir even was impossible,\nsince one slip and I must be gone.\n\nAnd below me, hung like a spider to its cord, Leo turning slowly round\nand round!\n\nI could see that rope of green hide stretch beneath his weight and the\ndouble knots in it slip and tighten, and I remember wondering which\nwould give first, the hide or the knots, or whether it would hold till\nhe dropped from the noose limb by limb.\n\nOh! I have been in many a perilous place, I who sprang from the Swaying\nStone to the point of the Trembling Spur, and missed my aim, but never,\nnever in such a one as this. Agony took hold of me; a cold sweat burst\nfrom every pore. I could feel it running down my face like tears; my\nhair bristled upon my head. And below, in utter silence, Leo turned\nround and round, and each time he turned his up-cast eyes met mine with\na look that was horrible to see.\n\nThe silence was the worst of it, the silence and the helplessness. If\nhe had cried out, if he had struggled, it would have been better. But\nto know that he was alive there, with every nerve and perception at its\nutmost stretch. Oh! my God! Oh! my God!\n\nMy limbs began to ache, and yet I dared not stir a muscle. They\nached horribly, or so I thought, and beneath this torture, mental and\nphysical, my mind gave.\n\nI remembered things: remembered how, as a child, I had climbed a tree\nand reached a place whence I could move neither up nor down, and what I\nsuffered then. Remembered how once in Egypt a foolhardy friend of mine\nhad ascended the Second Pyramid alone, and become thus crucified upon\nits shining cap, where he remained for a whole half hour with four\nhundred feet of space beneath him. I could see him now stretching his\nstockinged foot downwards in a vain attempt to reach the next crack, and\ndrawing it back again; could see his tortured face, a white blot upon\nthe red granite.\n\nThen that face vanished and blackness gathered round me, and in\nthe blackness visions: of the living, resistless avalanche, of the\nsnow-grave into which I had sunk--oh! years and years ago; of Ayesha\ndemanding Leo's life at my hands. Blackness and silence, through which I\ncould only hear the cracking of my muscles.\n\nSuddenly in the blackness a flash, and in the silence a sound. The flash\nwas the flash of a knife which Leo had drawn. He was hacking at the cord\nwith it fiercely, fiercely, to make an end. And the sound was that of\nthe noise he made, a ghastly noise, half shout of defiance and half yell\nof terror, as at the third stroke it parted.\n\nI saw it part. The tough hide was half cut through, and its severed\nportion curled upwards and downwards like the upper and lower lips of an\nangry dog, whilst that which was unsevered stretched out slowly, slowly,\ntill it grew quite thin. Then it snapped, so that the rope flew upwards\nand struck me across the face like the lash of a whip.\n\nAnother instant and I heard a crackling, thudding sound. Leo had struck\nthe ground below. Leo was dead, a mangled mass of flesh and bone as I\nhad pictured him. I could not bear it. My nerve and human dignity came\nback. I would not wait until, my strength exhausted, I slid from my\nperch as a wounded bird falls from a tree. No, I would follow him at\nonce, of my own act.\n\nI let my arms fall against my sides, and rejoiced in the relief from\npain that the movement gave me. Then balanced upon my heels, I stood\nupright, took my last look at the sky, muttered my last prayer. For an\ninstant I remained thus poised.\n\nShouting, \"I come,\" I raised my hands above my head and dived as a\nbather dives, dived into the black gulf beneath.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nIN THE GATE\n\nOh! that rush through space! Folk falling thus are supposed to lose\nconsciousness, but I can assert that this is not true. Never were my\nwits and perceptions more lively than while I travelled from that broken\nglacier to the ground, and never did a short journey seem to take a\nlonger time. I saw the white floor, like some living thing, leaping up\nthrough empty air to meet me, then--_finis!_\n\nCrash! Why, what was this? I still lived. I was in water, for I could\nfeel its chill, and going down, down, till I thought I should never rise\nagain. But rise I did, though my lungs were nigh to bursting first. As I\nfloated up towards the top I remembered the crash, which told me that\nI had passed through ice. Therefore I should meet ice at the surface\nagain. Oh! to think that after surviving so much I must be drowned like\na kitten and beneath a sheet of ice. My hands touched it. There it was\nabove me shining white like glass. Heaven be praised! My head broke\nthrough; in this low and sheltered gorge it was but a film no thicker\nthan a penny formed by the light frost of the previous night. So I rose\nfrom the deep and stared about me, treading water with my feet.\n\nThen I saw the gladdest sight that ever my eyes beheld, for on the\nright, not ten yards away, the water running from his hair and beard,\nwas Leo. Leo alive, for he broke the thin ice with his arms as he\nstruggled towards the shore from the deep river.[*] He saw me also, and\nhis grey eyes seemed to start out of his head.\n\n     [*] Usually, as we learned afterwards, the river at this\n     spot was quite shallow; only a foot or two in depth. It was\n     the avalanche that by damming it with fallen heaps of snow\n     had raised its level very many feet. Therefore, to this\n     avalanche, which had threatened to destroy us, we in reality\n     owed our lives, for had the stream stood only at its normal\n     height we must have been dashed to pieces upon the stones.\n     --L. H. H.\n\n\"Still living, both of us, and the precipice passed!\" he shouted in a\nringing, exultant voice. \"I told you we were led.\"\n\n\"Aye, but whither?\" I answered as I too fought my way through the film\nof ice.\n\nThen it was I became aware that we were no longer alone, for on the\nbank of the river, some thirty yards from us, stood two figures, a man\nleaning upon a long staff and a woman. He was a very old man, for his\neyes were horny, his snow-white hair and beard hung upon the bent breast\nand shoulders, and his sardonic, wrinkled features were yellow as wax.\nThey might have been those of a death mask cut in marble. There, clad in\nan ample, monkish robe, and leaning upon the staff, he stood still as\na statue and watched us. I noted it all, every detail, although at the\ntime I did not know that I was doing so, as we broke our way through the\nice towards them and afterwards the picture came back to me. Also I saw\nthat the woman, who was very tall, pointed to us.\n\nNearer the bank, or rather to the rock edge of the river, its surface\nwas free of ice, for here the stream ran very swiftly. Seeing this, we\ndrew close together and swam on side by side to help each other if need\nwere. There was much need, for in the fringe of the torrent the strength\nthat had served me so long seemed to desert me, and I became helpless;\nnumbed, too, with the biting coldness of the water. Indeed, had not Leo\ngrasped my clothes I think that I should have been swept away by the\ncurrent to perish. Thus aided I fought on a while, till he said--\"I am\ngoing under. Hold to the rope end.\"\n\nSo I gripped the strip of yak's hide that was still fast about him, and,\nhis hand thus freed, Leo made a last splendid effort to keep us both,\ncumbered as we were with the thick, soaked garments that dragged us down\nlike lead, from being sucked beneath the surface. Moreover, he succeeded\nwhere any other swimmer of less strength must have failed. Still, I\nbelieve that we should have drowned, since here the water ran like a\nmill-race, had not the man upon the shore, seeing our plight and urged\nthereto by the woman, run with surprising swiftness in one so aged, to a\npoint of rock that jutted some yards into the stream, past which we were\nbeing swept, and seating himself, stretched out his long stick towards\nus.\n\nWith a desperate endeavour, Leo grasped it as we went by, rolling over\nand over each other, and held on. Round we swung into the eddy, found\nour feet, were knocked down again, rubbed and pounded on the rocks. But\nstill gripping that staff of salvation, to his end of which the old\nman clung like a limpet to a stone, while the woman clung to him, we\nrecovered ourselves, and, sheltered somewhat by the rock, floundered\ntowards the shore. Lying on his face--for we were still in great\ndanger--the man extended his arm. We could not reach it; and worse,\nsuddenly the staff was torn from him; we were being swept away.\n\nThen it was that the woman did a noble thing, for springing into the\nwater--yes, up to her armpits--and holding fast to the old man by\nher left hand, with the right she seized Leo's hair and dragged him\nshorewards. Now he found his feet for a moment, and throwing one arm\nabout her slender form, steadied himself thus, while with the other he\nsupported me. Next followed a long confused struggle, but the end of it\nwas that three of us, the old man, Leo and I, rolled in a heap upon the\nbank and lay there gasping.\n\nPresently I looked up. The woman stood over us, water streaming from her\ngarments, staring like one in a dream at Leo's face, smothered as it was\nwith blood running from a deep cut in his head. Even then I noticed how\nstately and beautiful she was. Now she seemed to awake and, glancing\nat the robes that clung to her splendid shape, said something to her\ncompanion, then turned and ran towards the cliff.\n\nAs we lay before him, utterly exhausted, the old man, who had risen,\ncontemplated us solemnly with his dim eyes. He spoke, but we did not\nunderstand. Again he tried another language and without success. A third\ntime and our ears were opened, for the tongue he used was Greek; yes,\nthere in Central Asia he addressed us in Greek, not very pure, it is\ntrue, but still Greek.\n\n\"Are you wizards,\" he said, \"that you have lived to reach this land?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" I answered in the same tongue, though in broken words--since of\nGreek I had thought little for many a year--\"for then we should have\ncome otherwise,\" and I pointed to our hurts and the precipice behind us.\n\n\"They know the ancient speech; it is as we were told from the Mountain,\"\nhe muttered to himself. Then he asked--\"Strangers, what seek you?\"\n\nNow I grew cunning and did not answer, fearing lest, should he learn\nthe truth, he would thrust us back into the river. But Leo had no such\ncaution, or rather all reason had left him; he was light-headed.\n\n\"We seek,\" he stuttered out--his Greek, which had always been feeble,\nnow was simply barbarous and mixed with various Thibetan dialects--\"we\nseek the land of the Fire Mountain that is crowned with the Sign of\nLife.\"\n\nThe man stared at us. \"So you know,\" he said, then broke off and added,\n\"and _whom_ do you seek?\"\n\n\"Her,\" answered Leo wildly, \"the Queen.\" I think that he meant to say\nthe priestess, or the goddess, but could only think of the Greek for\nQueen, or rather something resembling it. Or perhaps it was because the\nwoman who had gone looked like a queen.\n\n\"Oh!\" said the man, \"you seek a queen--then you _are_ those for whom we\nwere bidden to watch. Nay, how can I be sure?\"\n\n\"Is this a time to put questions?\" I gasped angrily. \"Answer me one\nrather: who are you?\"\n\n\"I? Strangers, my title is Guardian of the Gate, and the lady who was\nwith me is the Khania of Kaloon.\"\n\nAt this point Leo began to faint.\n\n\"That man is sick,\" said the Guardian, \"and now that you have got your\nbreath again, you must have shelter, both of you, and at once. Come,\nhelp me.\"\n\nSo, supporting Leo on either side, we dragged ourselves away from that\naccursed cliff and Styx-like river up a narrow, winding gorge. Presently\nit opened out, and there, stretching across the glade, we saw the Gate.\nOf this all I observed then, for my memory of the details of this scene\nand of the conversation that passed is very weak and blurred, was\nthat it seemed to be a mighty wall of rock in which a pathway had been\nhollowed where doubtless once passed the road. On one side of this\npassage was a stair, which we began to ascend with great difficulty, for\nLeo was now almost senseless and scarcely moved his legs. Indeed at the\nhead of the first flight he sank down in a heap, nor did our strength\nsuffice to lift him.\n\nWhile I wondered feebly what was to be done, I heard footsteps, and\nlooking up, saw the woman who had saved him descending the stair,\nand after her two robed men with a Tartar cast of countenance, very\nimpassive; small eyes and yellowish skin. Even the sight of us did\nnot appear to move them to astonishment. She spoke some words to them,\nwhereon they lifted Leo's heavy frame, apparently with ease, and carried\nhim up the steps.\n\nWe followed, and reached a room that seemed to be hewn from the rock\nabove the gateway, where the woman called Khania left us. From it we\npassed through other rooms, one of them a kind of kitchen, in which\na fire burned, till we came to a large chamber, evidently a sleeping\nplace, for in it were wooden bedsteads, mattresses and rugs. Here Leo\nwas laid down, and with the assistance of one of his servants, the old\nGuardian undressed him, at the same time motioning me to take off my own\ngarments. This I did gladly enough for the first time during many days,\nthough with great pain and difficulty, to find that I was a mass of\nwounds and bruises.\n\nPresently our host blew upon a whistle, and the other servant appeared\nbringing hot water in a jar, with which we were washed over. Then the\nGuardian dressed our hurts with some soothing ointment, and wrapped us\nround with blankets. After this broth was brought, into which he mixed\nmedicine, and giving me a portion to drink where I lay upon one of the\nbeds, he took Leo's head upon his knee and poured the rest of it down\nhis throat. Instantly a wonderful warmth ran through me, and my aching\nbrain began to swim. Then I remembered no more.\n\nAfter this we were very, very ill. What may be the exact medical\ndefinition of our sickness I do not know, but in effect it was such as\nfollows loss of blood, extreme exhaustion of body, paralysing shock\nto the nerves and extensive cuts and contusions. These taken together\nproduced a long period of semi-unconsciousness, followed by another\nperiod of fever and delirium. All that I can recall of those weeks while\nwe remained the guests of the Guardian of the Gate, may be summed up in\none word--dreams, that is until at last I recovered my senses.\n\nThe dreams themselves are forgotten, which is perhaps as well, since\nthey were very confused, and for the most part awful; a hotch-potch of\nnightmares, reflected without doubt from vivid memories of our recent\nand fearsome sufferings. At times I would wake up from them a little,\nI suppose when food was administered to me, and receive impressions\nof whatever was passing in the place. Thus I can recollect that\nyellow-faced old Guardian standing over me like a ghost in the\nmoonlight, stroking his long beard, his eyes fixed upon my face, as\nthough he would search out the secrets of my soul.\n\n\"They are the men,\" he muttered to himself, \"without doubt they are the\nmen,\" then walked to the window and looked up long and earnestly, like\none who studies the stars.\n\nAfter this I remember a disturbance in the room, and dominating it, as\nit were, the rich sound of a woman's voice and the rustle of a woman's\nsilks sweeping the stone floor. I opened my eyes and saw that it was she\nwho had helped to rescue us, who _had_ rescued us in fact, a tall and\nnoble-looking lady with a beauteous, weary face and liquid eyes which\nseemed to burn. From the heavy cloak she wore I thought that she must\nhave just returned from a journey.\n\nShe stood above me and looked at me, then turned away with a gesture\nof indifference, if not of disgust, speaking to the Guardian in a low\nvoice. By way of answer he bowed, pointing to the other bed where Leo\nlay, asleep, and thither she passed with slow, imperious movements. I\nsaw her bend down and lift the corner of a wrapping which covered his\nwounded head, and heard her utter some smothered words before she turned\nround to the Guardian as though to question him further.\n\nBut he had gone, and being alone, for she thought me senseless, she drew\na rough stool to the side of the bed, and seating herself studied Leo,\nwho lay thereon, with an earnestness that was almost terrible, for\nher soul seemed to be concentrated in her eyes, and to find expression\nthrough them. Long she gazed thus, then rose and began to walk swiftly\nup and down the chamber, pressing her hands now to her bosom and now\nto her brow, a certain passionate perplexity stamped upon her face, as\nthough she struggled to remember something and could not.\n\n\"Where and when?\" she whispered. \"Oh! where and when?\"\n\nOf the end of that scene I know nothing, for although I fought hard\nagainst it, oblivion mastered me. After this I became aware that the\nregal-looking woman called Khania, was always in the room, and that she\nseemed to be nursing Leo with great care and tenderness. Sometimes even\nshe nursed me when Leo did not need attention, and she had nothing else\nto do, or so her manner seemed to suggest. It was as though I excited\nher curiosity, and she wished me to recover that it might be satisfied.\n\nAgain I awoke, how long afterwards I cannot say. It was night, and\nthe room was lighted by the moon only, now shining in a clear sky. Its\nsteady rays entering at the window-place fell on Leo's bed, and by them\nI saw that the dark, imperial woman was watching at his side. Some sense\nof her presence must have communicated itself to him, for he began to\nmutter in his sleep, now in English, now in Arabic. She became intensely\ninterested; as her every movement showed. Then rising suddenly she\nglided across the room on tiptoe to look at me. Seeing her coming I\nfeigned to be asleep, and so well that she was deceived.\n\nFor I was also interested. Who was this lady whom the Guardian had\ncalled the Khania of Kaloon? Could it be she whom we sought? Why not?\nAnd yet if I saw Ayesha, surely I should know her, surely there would be\nno room for doubt.\n\nBack she went again to the bed, kneeling down beside Leo, and in the\nintense silence which followed--for he had ceased his mutterings--I\nthought that I could hear the beating of her heart. Now she began to\nspeak, very low and in that same bastard Greek tongue, mixed here and\nthere with Mongolian words such as are common to the dialects of Central\nAsia. I could not hear or understand all she said, but some sentences I\ndid understand, and they frightened me not a little.\n\n\"Man of my dreams,\" she murmured, \"whence come you? Who are you? Why did\nthe Hesea bid me to meet you?\" Then some sentences I could not catch.\n\"You sleep; in sleep the eyes are opened. Answer, I bid you; say what\nis the bond between you and me? Why have I dreamt of you? Why do I know\nyou? Why----?\" and the sweet, rich voice died slowly from a whisper into\nsilence, as though she were ashamed to utter what was on her tongue.\n\nAs she bent over him a lock of her hair broke loose from its jewelled\nfillet and fell across his face. At its touch Leo seemed to wake, for\nhe lifted his gaunt, white hand and touched the hair, then said in\nEnglish--\"Where am I? Oh! I remember;\" and their eyes met as he strove\nto lift himself and could not. Then he spoke again in his broken,\nstumbling Greek, \"You are the lady who saved me from the water. Say, are\nyou also that queen whom I have sought so long and endured so much to\nfind?\"\n\n\"I know not,\" she answered in a voice as sweet as honey, a low,\ntrembling voice; \"but true it is I am a queen--if a Khania be a queen.\"\n\n\"Say, then, Queen, do you remember me?\"\n\n\"We have met in dreams,\" she answered, \"I think that we have met in a\npast that is far away. Yes; I knew it when first I saw you there by the\nriver. Stranger with the well remembered face, tell me, I pray you, how\nyou are named?\"\n\n\"Leo Vincey.\"\n\nShe shook her head, whispering--\"I know not the name, yet you I know.\"\n\n\"You know me! How do you know me?\" he said heavily, and seemed to sink\nagain into slumber or swoon.\n\nShe watched him for a while very intently. Then as though some force\nthat she could not resist drew her, I saw her bend down her head over\nhis sleeping face. Yes; and I saw her kiss him swiftly on the lips, then\nspring back crimson to the hair, as though overwhelmed with shame at\nthis victory of her mad passion.\n\nNow it was that she discovered me.\n\nBewildered, fascinated, amazed, I had raised myself upon my bed, not\nknowing it; I suppose that I might see and hear the better. It was\nwrong, doubtless, but no common curiosity over-mastered me, who had my\nshare in all this story. More, it was foolish, but illness and wonder\nhad killed my reason.\n\nYes, she saw me watching them, and such fury seemed to take hold of her\nthat I thought my hour had come.\n\n\"Man, have you dared----?\" she said in an intense whisper, and snatching\nat her girdle. Now in her hand shone a knife, and I knew that it was\ndestined for my heart. Then in this sore danger my wit came back to me\nand as she advanced I stretched out my shaking hand, saying--\"Oh! of\nyour pity, give me to drink. The fever burns me, it burns,\" and I looked\nround like one bewildered who sees not, repeating, \"Give me drink, you\nwho are called Guardian,\" and I fell back exhausted.\n\nShe stopped like a hawk in its stoop, and swiftly sheathed the dagger.\nThen taking a bowl of milk that stood on a table near her, she held\nit to my lips, searching my face the while with her flaming eyes, for\nindeed passion, rage, and fear had lit them till they seemed to flame.\nI drank the milk in great gulps, though never in my life did I find it\nmore hard to swallow.\n\n\"You tremble,\" she said; \"have dreams haunted you?\"\n\n\"Aye, friend,\" I answered, \"dreams of that fearsome precipice and of the\nlast leap.\"\n\n\"Aught else?\" she asked.\n\n\"Nay; is it not enough? Oh! what a journey to have taken to befriend a\nqueen.\"\n\n\"To befriend a queen,\" she repeated puzzled. \"What means the man? You\nswear you have had no other dreams?\"\n\n\"Aye, I swear by the Symbol of Life and the Mount of the Wavering Flame,\nand by yourself, O Queen from the ancient days.\"\n\nThen I sighed and pretended to swoon, for I could think of nothing else\nto do. As I closed my eyes I saw her face that had been red as dawn turn\npale as eve, for my words and all which might lie behind them, had gone\nhome. Moreover, she was in doubt, for I could hear her fingering the\nhandle of the dagger. Then she spoke aloud, words for my ears if they\nstill were open.\n\n\"I am glad,\" she said, \"that he dreamed no other dreams, since had he\ndone so and babbled of them it would have been ill-omened, and I do not\nwish that one who has travelled far to visit us should be hurled to\nthe death-dogs for burial; one, moreover, who although old and hideous,\nstill has the air of a wise and silent man.\"\n\nNow while I shivered at these unpleasant hints--though what the\n\"death-dogs\" in which people were buried might be, I could not\nconceive--to my intense joy I heard the foot of the Guardian on the\nstairs, heard him too enter the room and saw him bow before the lady.\n\n\"How go these sick men, niece?\"[*] he said in his cold voice.\n\n     [*] I found later that the Khania, Atene, was not Simbri's\n     niece but his great-niece, on the mother's side.--L. H. H.\n\n\"They swoon, both of them,\" she answered.\n\n\"Indeed, is it so? I thought otherwise. I thought they woke.\"\n\n\"What have you heard, Shaman (i.e. wizard)?\" she asked angrily.\n\n\"I? Oh! I heard the grating of a dagger in its sheath and the distant\nbaying of the death-hounds.\"\n\n\"And what have you seen, Shaman?\" she asked again, \"looking through the\nGate you guard?\"\n\n\"Strange sight, Khania, my niece. But--men awake from swoons.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" she answered, \"so while this one sleeps, bear him to another\nchamber, for he needs change, and the lord yonder needs more space and\nuntainted air.\"\n\nThe Guardian, whom she called \"Shaman\" or Magician, held a lamp in his\nhand, and by its light it was easy to see his face, which I watched\nout of the corner of my eye. I thought that it wore a very strange\nexpression, one moreover that alarmed me somewhat. From the beginning\nI had misdoubted me of this old man, whose cast of countenance was\nvindictive as it was able; now I was afraid of him.\n\n\"To which chamber, Khania?\" he said with meaning.\n\n\"I think,\" she answered slowly, \"to one that is healthful, where he\nwill recover. The man has wisdom,\" she added as though in explanation,\n\"moreover, having the word from the Mountain, to harm him would be\ndangerous. But why do you ask?\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I tell you I heard the death-hounds bay, that is all. Yes, with you I\nthink that he has wisdom, and the bee which seeks honey should suck the\nflower--before it fades! Also, as you say, there are commands with which\nit is ill to trifle, even if we cannot guess their meaning.\"\n\nThen going to the door he blew upon his whistle, and instantly I heard\nthe feet of his servants upon the stairs. He gave them an order, and\ngently enough they lifted the mattress on which I lay and followed him\ndown sundry passages and past some stairs into another chamber shaped\nlike that we had left, but not so large, where they placed me upon a\nbed.\n\nThe Guardian watched me awhile to see that I did not wake. Next he\nstretched out his hand and felt my heart and pulse; an examination\nthe results of which seemed to _puzzle_ him, for he uttered a little\nexclamation and shook his head. After this he left the room, and I heard\nhim bolt the door behind him. Then, being still very weak, I fell asleep\nin earnest.\n\nWhen I awoke it was broad daylight. My mind was clear and I felt better\nthan I had done for many a day, signs by which I knew that the fever had\nleft me and that I was on the high road to recovery. Now I remembered\nall the events of the previous night and was able to weigh them\ncarefully. This, to be sure, I did for many reasons, among them that I\nknew I had been and still was, in great danger.\n\nI had seen and heard too much, and this woman called Khania guessed that\nI had seen and heard. Indeed, had it not been for my hints about the\nSymbol of Life and the Mount of Flame, after I had disarmed her first\nrage by my artifice, I felt sure that she would have ordered the old\nGuardian or Shaman to do me to death in this way or the other; sure also\nthat he would not have hesitated to obey her. I had been spared partly\nbecause, for some unknown reason, she was afraid to kill me, and partly\nthat she might learn how much I knew, although the \"death-hounds had\nbayed,\" whatever that might mean. Well, up to the present I was safe,\nand for the rest I must take my chance. Moreover it was necessary to\nbe cautious, and, if need were, to feign ignorance. So, dismissing the\nmatter of my own fate from my mind, I fell to considering the scene\nwhich I had witnessed and what might be its purport.\n\nWas our quest at an end? Was this woman Ayesha? Leo had so dreamed, but\nhe was still delirious, therefore here was little on which to lean.\nWhat seemed more to the point was that she herself evidently appeared to\nthink that there existed some tie between her and this sick man. Why\nhad she embraced him? I was sure that she could be no wanton, nor indeed\nwould any woman indulge for its own sake in such folly with a stranger\nwho hung between life and death. What she had done was done because\nirresistible impulse, born of knowledge, or at least of memories, drove\nher on, though mayhap the knowledge was imperfect and the memories were\nundefined. Who save Ayesha could have known anything of Leo in the past?\nNone who lived upon the earth to-day.\n\nAnd yet, why not, if what Kou-en the abbot and tens of millions of his\nfellow-worshippers believed were true? If the souls of human beings were\nin fact strictly limited in number, and became the tenants of an endless\nsuccession of physical bodies which they change from time to time as we\nchange our worn-out garments, why should not others have known him? For\ninstance that daughter of the Pharaohs who \"caused him through love to\nbreak the vows that he had vowed\" knew a certain Kallikrates, a priest\nof \"Isis whom the gods cherish and the demons obey;\" even Amenartas, the\nmistress of magic.\n\nOh! now a light seemed to break upon me, a wonderful light. What if\nAmenartas and this Khania, this woman with royalty stamped on every\nfeature, should be the same? Would not that \"magic of my own people\nthat I have\" of which she wrote upon the Sherd, enable her to pierce the\ndarkness of the Past and recognize the priest whom she had bewitched to\nlove her, snatching him out of the very hand of the goddess? What if it\nwere not Ayesha, but Amenartas re-incarnate who ruled this hidden land\nand once more sought to make the man she loved break through his vows?\nIf so, knowing the evil that must come, I shook even at its shadow. The\ntruth must be learned, but how?\n\nWhilst I wondered the door opened, and the sardonic,\ninscrutable-old-faced man, whom this Khania had called Magician, and who\ncalled the Khania, niece, entered and stood before me.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTHE FIRST ORDEAL\n\nThe shaman advanced to my side and asked me courteously how I fared.\n\nI answered, \"Better. Far better, oh, my host--but how are you named?\"\n\n\"Simbri,\" he answered, \"and, as I told you by the water, my title is\nHereditary Guardian of the Gate. By profession I am the royal Physician\nin this land.\"\n\n\"Did you say physician or magician?\" I asked carelessly, as though I had\nnot caught the word. He gave me a curious look.\n\n\"I _said_ physician, and it is well for you and your companion that I\nhave some skill in my art. Otherwise I think, perhaps, you would not\nhave been alive to-day, O my guest--but how are _you_ named?\"\n\n\"Holly,\" I said.\n\n\"O my guest, Holly.\"\n\n\"Had it not been for the foresight that brought you and the lady Khania\nto the edge of yonder darksome river, certainly we should _not_ have\nbeen alive, venerable Simbri, a foresight that seems to me to savour\nof magic in such a lonely place. That is why I thought you might have\ndescribed yourself as a magician, though it is true that you may have\nbeen but fishing in those waters.\"\n\n\"Certainly I was fishing, stranger Holly--for men, and I caught two.\"\n\n\"Fishing by chance, host Simbri?\"\n\n\"Nay, by design, guest Holly. My trade of physician includes the study\nof future events, for I am the chief of the Shamans or Seers of this\nland, and, having been warned of your coming quite recently, I awaited\nyour arrival.\"\n\n\"Indeed, that is strange, most courteous also. So here physician and\nmagician mean the same.\"\n\n\"You say it,\" he answered with a grave bow; \"but tell me, if you will,\nhow did you find your way to a land whither visitors do not wander?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" I answered, \"perhaps we are but travellers, or perhaps we also\nhave studied--medicine.\"\n\n\"I think that you must have studied it deeply, since otherwise you would\nnot have lived to cross those mountains in search of--now, what did you\nseek? Your companion, I think, spoke of a queen--yonder, on the banks of\nthe torrent.\"\n\n\"Did he? Did he, indeed? Well, that is strange since he seems to have\nfound one, for surely that royal-looking lady, named Khania, who sprang\ninto the stream and saved us, must be a queen.\"\n\n\"A queen she is, and a great one, for in our land Khania means queen,\nthough how, friend Holly, a man who has lain senseless can have learned\nthis, I do not know. Nor do I know how you come to speak our language.\"\n\n\"That is simple, for the tongue you talk is very ancient, and as it\nchances in my own country it has been my lot to study and to teach\nit. It is Greek, but although it is still spoken in the world, how it\nreached these mountains I cannot say.\"\n\n\"I will tell you,\" he answered. \"Many generations ago a great conqueror\nborn of the nation that spoke this tongue fought his way through the\ncountry to the south of us. He was driven back, but a general of his of\nanother race advanced and crossed the mountains, and overcame the\npeople of this land, bringing with him his master's language and his own\nworship. Here he established his dynasty, and here it remains, for being\nringed in with deserts and with pathless mountain snows, we hold no\nconverse with the outer world.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know something of that story; the conqueror was named Alexander,\nwas he not?\" I asked.\n\n\"He was so named, and the name of the general was Rassen, a native of\na country called Egypt, or so our records tell us. His descendants hold\nthe throne to this day, and the Khania is of his blood.\"\n\n\"Was the goddess whom he worshipped called Isis?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" he answered, \"she was called Hes.\"\n\n\"Which,\" I interrupted, \"is but another title for Isis. Tell me, is her\nworship continued here? I ask because it is now dead in Egypt, which was\nits home.\"\n\n\"There is a temple on the Mountain yonder,\" he replied indifferently,\n\"and in it are priests and priestesses who practise some ancient cult.\nBut the real god of this people now, as long before the day of Rassen\ntheir conqueror, is the fire that dwells in this same Mountain, which\nfrom time to time breaks out and slays them.\"\n\n\"And does a goddess dwell in the fire?\" I asked.\n\nAgain he searched my face with his cold eyes, then answered--\"Stranger\nHolly, I know nothing of any goddess. That Mountain is sacred, and to\nseek to learn its secrets is to die. Why do you ask such questions?\"\n\n\"Only because I am curious in the matter of old religions, and seeing\nthe symbol of Life upon yonder peak, came hither to study yours, of\nwhich indeed a tradition still remains among the learned.\"\n\n\"Then abandon that study, friend Holly, for the road to it runs through\nthe paws of the death-hounds, and the spears of savages. Nor indeed is\nthere anything to learn.\"\n\n\"And what, Physician, are the death-hounds?\"\n\n\"Certain dogs to which, according to our ancient custom, all offenders\nagainst the law or the will of the Khan, are cast to be torn to pieces.\"\n\n\"The will of the Khan! Has this Khania of yours a husband then?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" he answered, \"her cousin, who was the ruler of half the land. Now\nthey and the land are one. But you have talked enough; I am here to say\nthat your food is ready,\" and he turned to leave the room.\n\n\"One more question, friend Simbri. How came I to this chamber, and where\nis my companion?\"\n\n\"You were borne hither in your sleep, and see, the change has bettered\nyou. Do you remember nothing?\"\n\n\"Nothing, nothing at all,\" I answered earnestly. \"But what of my\nfriend?\"\n\n\"He also is better. The Khania Atene nurses him.\"\n\n\"Atene?\" I said. \"That is an old Egyptian name. It means the Disk of the\nSun, and a woman who bore it thousands of years ago was famous for her\nbeauty.\"\n\n\"Well, and is not my niece Atene beautiful?\"\n\n\"How can I tell, O uncle of the Khania,\" I answered wearily, \"who have\nscarcely seen her?\"\n\nThen he departed, and presently his yellow-faced, silent servants\nbrought me my food.\n\nLater in the morning the door opened again, and through it, unattended,\ncame the Khania Atene, who shut and bolted it behind her. This action\ndid not reassure me, still, rising in my bed, I saluted her as best I\ncould, although at heart I was afraid. She seemed to read my doubts for\nshe said--\"Lie down, and have no fear. At present you will come by no\nharm from me. Now, tell me what is the man called Leo to you? Your son?\nNay, it cannot be, since--forgive me--light is not born of darkness.\"\n\n\"I have always thought that it was so born, Khania. Yet you are right;\nhe is but my adopted son, and a man whom I love.\"\n\n\"Say, what seek you here?\" she asked.\n\n\"We seek, Khania, whatsoever Fate shall bring us on yonder Mountain,\nthat which is crowned with flame.\"\n\nHer face paled at the words, but she answered in a steady voice--\"Then\nthere you will find nothing but doom, if indeed you do not find it\nbefore you reach its slopes, which are guarded by savage men. Yonder is\nthe College of Hes, and to violate its Sanctuary is death to any man,\ndeath in the ever-burning fire.\"\n\n\"And who rules this college, Khania--a priestess?\"\n\n\"Yes, a priestess, whose face I have never seen, for she is so old that\nshe veils herself from curious eyes.\"\n\n\"Ah! she veils herself, does she?\" I answered, as the blood went\nthrilling through my veins, I who remembered another who also was\n_so_ old that she veiled herself from curious eyes. \"Well, veiled or\nunveiled, we would visit her, trusting to find that we are welcome.\"\n\n\"That you shall not do,\" she said, \"for it is unlawful, and I will not\nhave your blood upon my hands.\"\n\n\"Which is the stronger,\" I asked of her, \"you, Khania, or this priestess\nof the Mountain?\"\n\n\"I am the stronger, Holly, for so you are named, are you not? Look you,\nat my need I can summon sixty thousand men in war, while she has naught\nbut her priests and the fierce, untrained tribes.\"\n\n\"The sword is not the only power in the world,\" I answered. \"Tell me,\nnow, does this priestess ever visit the country of Kaloon?\"\n\n\"Never, never, for by the ancient pact, made after the last great\nstruggle long centuries ago between the College and the people of the\nPlain, it was decreed and sworn to that should she set her foot across\nthe river, this means war to the end between us, and rule for the victor\nover both. Likewise, save when unguarded they bear their dead to burial,\nor for some such high purpose, no Khan or Khania of Kaloon ascends the\nMountain.\"\n\n\"Which then is the true master--the Khan of Kaloon or the head of the\nCollege of Hes?\" I asked again.\n\n\"In matters spiritual, the priestess of Hes, who is our Oracle and the\nvoice of Heaven. In matters temporal, the Khan of Kaloon.\"\n\n\"The Khan. Ah! you are married, lady, are you not?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" she answered, her face flushing. \"And I will tell you what you\nsoon must learn, if you have not learned it already, I am the wife of a\nmadman, and he is--hateful to me.\"\n\n\"I _have_ learned the last already, Khania.\"\n\nShe looked at me with her piercing eyes.\n\n\"What! Did my uncle, the Shaman, he who is called Guardian, tell you?\nNay, you saw, as I knew you saw, and it would have been best to slay you\nfor, oh! what must you think of me?\"\n\nI made no answer, for in truth I did not know what to think, also\nI feared lest further rash admissions should be followed by swift\nvengeance.\n\n\"You must believe,\" she went on, \"that I, who have ever hated men, that\nI--I swear that it is true--whose lips are purer than those mountain\nsnows, I, the Khania of Kaloon, whom they name Heart-of-Ice, am but a\nshameless thing.\" And, covering her face with her hand, she moaned in\nthe bitterness of her distress.\n\n\"Nay,\" I said, \"there may be reasons, explanations, if it pleases you to\ngive them.\"\n\n\"Wanderer, there are such reasons; and since you know so much, you shall\nlearn them also. Like that husband of mine, I have become mad. When\nfirst I saw the face of your companion, as I dragged him from the river,\nmadness entered me, and I--I----\"\n\n\"Loved him,\" I suggested. \"Well, such things have happened before to\npeople who were not mad.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she went on, \"it was more than love; I was possessed, and that\nnight I knew not what I did. A Power drove me on; a Destiny compelled\nme, and to the end I am his, and his alone. Yes, I am his, and I swear\nthat he shall be mine;\" and with this wild declaration dangerous enough\nunder the conditions, she turned and fled the room.\n\nShe was gone, and after the struggle, for such it was, I sank back\nexhausted. How came it that this sudden passion had mastered her? Who\nand what was this Khania, I wondered again, and--this was more to the\npoint, who and what would Leo believe her to be? If only I could be with\nhim before he said words or did deeds impossible to recall.\n\nThree days went by, during which time I saw no more of the Khania, who,\nor so I was informed by Simbri, the Shaman, had returned to her city to\nmake ready for us, her guests. I begged him to allow me to rejoin Leo,\nbut he answered politely, though with much firmness, that my foster-son\ndid better without me. Now, I grew suspicious, fearing lest some harm\nhad come to Leo, though how to discover the truth I knew not. In my\nanxiety I tried to convey a note to him, written upon a leaf of a\nwater-gained pocket-book, but the yellow-faced servant refused to touch\nit, and Simbri said drily that he would have naught to do with writings\nwhich he could not read. At length, on the third night I made up my mind\nthat whatever the risk, with leave or without it, I would try to find\nhim.\n\nBy this time I could walk well, and indeed was almost strong again. So\nabout midnight, when the moon was up, for I had no other light, I crept\nfrom my bed, threw on my garments, and taking a knife, which was the\nonly weapon I possessed, opened the door of my room and started.\n\nNow, when I was carried from the rock-chamber where Leo and I had\nbeen together, I took note of the way. First, reckoning from my\nsleeping-place, there was a passage thirty paces long, for I had counted\nthe footfalls of my bearers. Then came a turn to the left, and ten more\npaces of passage, and lastly near certain steps running to some place\nunknown, another sharp turn to the right which led to our old chamber.\n\nDown the long passage I walked stealthily, and although it was pitch\ndark, found the turn to the left, and followed it till I came to the\nsecond sharp turn to the right, that of the gallery from which rose\nthe stairs. I crept round it only to retreat hastily enough, as well\nI might, for at the door of Leo's room, which she was in the act of\nlocking on the outside, as I could see by the light of the lamp that she\nheld in her hand, stood the Khania herself.\n\nMy first thought was to fly back to my own chamber, but I abandoned\nit, feeling sure that I should be seen. Therefore I determined, if she\ndiscovered me, to face the matter out and say that I was trying to find\nLeo, and to learn how he fared. So I crouched against the wall, and\nwaited with a beating heart. I heard her sweep down the passage,\nand--yes--begin to mount the stair.\n\nNow, what should I do? To try to reach Leo was useless, for she had\nlocked the door with the key she held. Go back to bed? No, I would\nfollow her, and if we met would make the same excuse. Thus I might get\nsome tidings, or perhaps--a dagger thrust.\n\nSo round the corner and up the steps I went, noiselessly as a snake.\nThey were many and winding, like those of a church tower, but at length\nI came to the head of them, where was a little landing, and opening from\nit a door. It was a very ancient door; the light streamed through cracks\nwhere its panels had rotted, and from the room beyond came the sound of\nvoices, those of the Shaman Simbri and the Khania.\n\n\"Have you learned aught, my niece?\" I heard him say, and also heard her\nanswer---\"A little. A very little.\"\n\nThen in my thirst for knowledge I grew bold, and stealing to the door,\nlooked through one of the cracks in its wood. Opposite to me, in the\nfull flood of light thrown by a hanging lamp, her hand resting on a\ntable at which Simbri was seated, stood the Khania. Truly she was a\nbeauteous sight, for she wore robes of royal purple, and on her brow a\nlittle coronet of gold, beneath which her curling hair streamed down\nher shapely neck and bosom. Seeing her I guessed at once that she had\narrayed herself thus for some secret end, enhancing her loveliness by\nevery art and grace that is known to woman. Simbri was looking at her\nearnestly, with fear and doubt written on even his cold, impassive\nfeatures.\n\n\"What passed between you, then?\" he asked, peering at her.\n\n\"I questioned him closely as to the reason of his coming to this\nland, and wrung from him the answer that it was to seek some beauteous\nwoman--he would say no more. I asked him if she were more beauteous than\n_I_ am, and he replied with courtesy--nothing else, I think--that it\nwould be hard to say, but that she had been different. Then I said that\nthough it behooved me not to speak of such a matter, there was no lady\nin Kaloon whom men held to be so fair as I; moreover, that I was its\nruler, and that I and no other had saved him from the water. Aye, and I\nadded that my heart told me I was the woman whom he sought.\"\n\n\"Have done, niece,\" said Simbri impatiently, \"I would not hear of the\narts you used--well enough, doubtless. What then?\"\n\n\"Then he said that it might be so, since he thought that this woman\nwas born again, and studied me a while, asking me if I had ever 'passed\nthrough fire.' To this I replied that the only fires I had passed were\nthose of the spirit, and that I dwelt in them now. He said, 'Show me\nyour hair,' and I placed a lock of it in his hand. Presently he let\nit fall, and from that satchel which he wears about his neck drew out\nanother tress of hair--oh! Simbri, my uncle, the loveliest hair that\never eyes beheld, for it was soft as silk, and reached from my coronet\nto the ground. Moreover, no raven's wing in the sunshine ever shone as\ndid that fragrant tress.\n\n\"'Yours is beautiful,' he said, 'but see, they are not the same.'\n\n\"'Mayhap,' I answered, 'since no woman ever wore such locks.'\n\n\"'You are right,' he replied, 'for she whom I seek was more than a\nwoman.'\n\n\"And then--and then--though I tried him in many ways he would say no\nmore, so, feeling hate against this Unknown rising in my heart, and\nfearing lest I should utter words that were best unsaid, I left him. Now\nI bid you, search the books which are open to your wisdom and tell me of\nthis woman whom he seeks, who she is, and where she dwells. Oh! search\nthem swiftly, that I may find her and--kill her if I can.\"\n\n\"Aye, if you can,\" answered the Shaman, \"and if she lives to kill. But\nsay, where shall we begin our quest? Now, this letter from the Mountain\nthat the head-priest Oros sent to your court a while ago?\"--and he\nselected a parchment from a pile which lay upon the table and looked at\nher.\n\n\"Read,\" she said, \"I would hear it again.\"\n\nSo he read: \"From the Hesea of the House of Fire, to Atene, Khania of\nKaloon.\n\n\"My sister--Warning has reached me that two strangers of a western\nrace journey to your land, seeking my Oracle, of which they would ask a\nquestion. On the first day of the next moon, I command that you and with\nyou Simbri, your great-uncle, the wise Shaman, Guardian of the Gate,\nshall be watching the river in the gulf at the foot of the ancient road,\nfor by that steep path the strangers travel. Aid them in all things and\nbring them safely to the Mountain, knowing that in this matter I shall\nhold him and you to account. Myself I will not meet them, since to do so\nwould be to break the pact between our powers, which says that the Hesea\nof the Sanctuary visits not the territory of Kaloon, save in war. Also\ntheir coming is otherwise appointed.\"\n\n\"It would seem,\" said Simbri, laying down the parchment, \"that these are\nno chance wanderers, since Hes awaits them.\"\n\n\"Aye, they are no chance wanderers, since my heart awaited one of them\nalso. Yet the Hesea cannot be that woman, for reasons which are known to\nyou.\"\n\n\"There are many women on the Mountain,\" suggested the Shaman in a dry\nvoice, \"if indeed any woman has to do with this matter.\"\n\n\"I at least have to do with it, and he shall not go to the Mountain.\"\n\n\"Hes is powerful, my niece, and beneath these smooth words of hers lies\na dreadful threat. I say that she is mighty from of old and has servants\nin the earth and air who warned her of the coming of these men, and\nwill warn her of what befalls them. I know it, who hate her, and to your\nroyal house of Rassen it has been known for many a generation. Therefore\nthwart her not lest ill befall us all, for she is a spirit and terrible.\nShe says that it is appointed that they shall go----\"\n\n\"And _I_ say it is appointed that he shall not go. Let the other go if\nhe desires.\"\n\n\"Atene, be plain, what will you with the man called Leo--that he should\nbecome your lover?\" asked the Shaman.\n\nShe stared him straight in the eyes, and answered boldly--\"Nay, I will\nthat he should become my husband.\"\n\n\"First he must will it too, who seems to have no mind that way. Also,\nhow can a woman have two husbands?\"\n\nShe laid her hand upon his shoulder and said--\"I have no husband. You\nknow it well, Simbri. _I_ charge you by the close bond of blood between\nus, brew me another draught----\"\n\n\"That we may be bound yet closer in a bond of murder! Nay, Atene, I will\nnot; already your sin lies heavy on my head. You are very fair; take the\nman in your own net, if you may, or let him be, which is better far.\"\n\n\"I cannot let him be. Would that I were able. I must love him as I must\nhate the other whom he loves, yet some power hardens his heart against\nme. Oh! great Shaman, you that peep and mutter, you who can read the\nfuture and the past, tell me what you have learned from your stars and\ndivinations.\"\n\n\"Already I have sought through many a secret, toilsome hour and learned\nthis, Atene,\" he answered. \"You are right, the fate of yonder man is\nintertwined with yours, but between you and him there rises a mighty\nwall that my vision cannot pierce nor my familiars climb. Yet I am\ntaught that in death you and he--aye, and I also, shall be very near\ntogether.\"\n\n\"Then come death,\" she exclaimed with sullen pride, \"for thence at least\nI'll pluck out my desire.\"\n\n\"Be not so sure,\" he answered, \"for I think that the Power follows\nus even down this dark gulf of death. I think also that I feel the\nsleepless eyes of Hes watching our secret souls.\"\n\n\"Then blind them with the dust of illusions--as you can. To-morrow,\nalso, saying nothing of their sex, send a messenger to the Mountain and\ntell the Hesea that two old strangers have arrived--mark you, _old_--but\nthat they are very sick, that their limbs were broken in the river, and\nthat when they have healed again, I will send them to ask the question\nof her Oracle--that is, some three moons hence. Perchance she may\nbelieve you, and be content to wait; or if she does not, at least no\nmore words. I must sleep or my brain will burst. Give me that medicine\nwhich brings dreamless rest, for never did I need it more, who also feel\neyes upon me,\" and she glanced towards the door.\n\nThen I left, and not too soon, for as I crept down the darksome passage,\nI heard it open behind me.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE DEATH-HOUNDS\n\nIt may have been ten o'clock on the following morning, or a little past\nit, when the Shaman Simbri came into my room and asked me how I had\nslept.\n\n\"Like a log,\" I answered, \"like a log. A drugged man could not have\nrested more soundly.\"\n\n\"Indeed, friend Holly, and yet you look fatigued.\"\n\n\"My dreams troubled me somewhat,\" I answered. \"I suffer from such\nthings. But surely by your face, friend Simbri, you cannot have slept at\nall, for never yet have I seen you with so weary an air.\"\n\n\"I am weary,\" he said, with a sigh. \"Last night I spent up on my\nbusiness--watching at the Gates.\"\n\n\"What gates?\" I asked. \"Those by which we entered this kingdom, for, if\nso, I would rather watch than travel them.\"\n\n\"The Gates of the Past and of the Future. Yes, those two which you\nentered, if you will; for did you not travel out of a wondrous Past\ntowards a Future that you cannot _guess?_\"\n\n\"But both of which interest you,\" I suggested.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" he answered, then added, \"I come to tell you that within an\nhour you are to start for the city, whither the Khania has but now gone\non to make ready for you.\"\n\n\"Yes; only you told me that she had gone some days ago. Well, I am sound\nagain and prepared to march, but say, how is my foster-son?\"\n\n\"He mends, he mends. But you shall see him for yourself. It is the\nKhania's will. Here come the slaves bearing your robes, and with them I\nleave you.\"\n\nSo with their assistance I dressed myself, first in good, clean\nunder-linen, then in wide woollen trousers and vest, and lastly in a\nfur-lined camel-hair robe dyed black that was very comfortable to wear,\nand in appearance not unlike a long overcoat. A flat cap of the same\nmaterial and a pair of boots made of untanned hide completed my attire.\n\nScarcely was I ready when the yellow-faced servants, with many bows,\ntook me by the hand and led me down the passages and stairs of the\nGate-house to its door. Here, to my great joy, I found Leo, looking\npale and troubled, but otherwise as well as I could expect after his\nsickness. He was attired like myself, save that his garments were of a\nfiner quality, and the overcoat was white, with a hood to it, added, I\nsuppose, to protect the wound in his head from cold and the sun. This\nwhite dress I thought became him very well, also about it there was\nnothing grotesque or even remarkable. He sprang to me and seized my\nhand, asking how I fared and where I had been hidden away, a greeting\nof which, as I could see, the warmth was not lost upon Simbri, who stood\nby.\n\nI answered, well enough now that we were together again, and for the\nrest I would tell him later.\n\nThen they brought us palanquins, carried, each of them, by two ponies,\none of which was harnessed ahead and the other behind between long\nshaft-like poles. In these we seated ourselves, and at a sign from\nSimbri slaves took the leading ponies by the bridle and we started,\nleaving behind us that grim old Gate-house through which we were the\nfirst strangers to pass for many a generation.\n\nFor a mile or more our road ran down a winding, rocky gorge, till\nsuddenly it took a turn, and the country of Kaloon lay stretched before\nus. At our feet was a river, probably the same with which we had made\nacquaintance in the gulf, where, fed by the mountain snows, it had its\nsource. Here it flowed rapidly, but on the vast, alluvial lands\nbeneath became a broad and gentle stream that wound its way through the\nlimitless plains till it was lost in the blue of the distance.\n\nTo the north, however, this smooth, monotonous expanse was broken by\nthat Mountain which had guided us from afar, the House of Fire. It was\na great distance from us, more than a hundred miles, I should say, yet\neven so a most majestic sight in that clear air. Many leagues from the\nbase of its peak the ground began to rise in brown and rugged hillocks,\nfrom which sprang the holy Mountain itself, a white and dazzling point\nthat soared full twenty thousand feet into the heavens.\n\nYes, and there upon the nether lip of its crater stood the gigantic\npillar, surmounted by a yet more gigantic loop of virgin rock, whereof\nthe blackness stood out grimly against the blue of the sky beyond and\nthe blinding snow beneath.\n\nWe gazed at it with awe, as well we might, this beacon of our hopes that\nfor aught we knew might also prove their monument, feeling even then\nthat yonder our fate would declare itself. I noted further that all\nthose with us did it reverence by bowing their heads as they caught\nsight of the peak, and by laying the first finger of the right hand\nacross the first finger of the left, a gesture, as we afterwards\ndiscovered, designed to avert its evil influence. Yes, even Simbri\nbowed, a yielding to inherited superstition of which I should scarcely\nhave suspected him.\n\n\"Have you ever journeyed to that Mountain?\" asked Leo of him.\n\nSimbri shook his head and answered evasively.\n\n\"The people of the Plain do not set foot upon the Mountain. Among its\nslopes beyond the river which washes them, live hordes of brave and most\nsavage men, with whom we are oftentimes at war; for when they are hungry\nthey raid our cattle and our crops. Moreover, there, when the Mountain\nlabours, run red streams of molten rock, and now and again hot ashes\nfall that slay the traveller.\"\n\n\"Do the ashes ever fall in your country?\" asked Leo.\n\n\"They have been known to do so when the Spirit of the Mountain is angry,\nand that is why we fear her.\"\n\n\"Who is this Spirit?\" said Leo eagerly.\n\n\"I do not know, lord,\" he answered with impatience. \"Can men see a\nspirit?\"\n\n\"_You_ look as though you might, and had, not so long ago,\" replied Leo,\nfixing his gaze on the old man's waxen face and uneasy eyes. For now\ntheir horny calm was gone from the eyes of Simbri, which seemed as\nthough they had beheld some sight that haunted him.\n\n\"You do me too much honour, lord,\" he replied; \"my skill and vision do\nnot reach so far. But see, here is the landing-stage, where boats await\nus, for the rest of our journey is by water.\"\n\nThese boats proved to be roomy and comfortable, having flat bows and\nsterns, since, although sometimes a sail was hoisted, they were designed\nfor towing, not to be rowed with oars. Leo and I entered the largest of\nthem, and to our joy were left alone except for the steersman.\n\nBehind us was another boat, in which were attendants and slaves, and\nsome men who looked like soldiers, for they carried bows and swords. Now\nthe ponies were taken from the palanquins, that were packed away, and\nropes of green hide, fastened to iron rings in the prows of the\nboats, were fixed to the towing tackle with which the animals had been\nreharnessed. Then we started, the ponies, two arranged tandem fashion\nto each punt, trotting along a well-made towing path that was furnished\nwith wooden bridges wherever canals or tributary streams entered the\nmain river.\n\n\"Thank Heaven,\" said Leo, \"we are together again at last! Do you\nremember, Horace, that when we entered the land of Kor it was thus, in a\nboat? The tale repeats itself.\"\n\n\"I can quite believe it,\" I answered. \"I can believe anything. Leo,\nI say that we are but gnats meshed in a web, and yonder Khania is\nthe spider and Simbri the Shaman guards the net. But tell me all you\nremember of what has happened to you, and be quick, for I do not know\nhow long they may leave us alone.\"\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"of course I remember our arrival at that Gate after\nthe lady and the old man had pulled us out of the river, and, Horace,\ntalking of spiders reminds me of hanging at the end of that string\nof yak's hide. Not that I need much reminding, for I am not likely to\nforget it. Do you know I cut the rope because I felt that I was going\nmad, and wished to die sane. What happened to you? Did you slip?\"\n\n\"No; I jumped after you. It seemed best to end together, so that we\nmight begin again together.\"\n\n\"Brave old Horace!\" he said affectionately, the tears starting to his\ngrey eyes.\n\n\"Well, never mind all that,\" I broke in; \"you see you were right when\nyou said that we should get through, and we have. Now for your tale.\"\n\n\"It is interesting, but not very long,\" he answered, colouring. \"I went\nto sleep, and when I woke it was to find a beautiful woman leaning over\nme, and Horace--at first I thought that it was--you know who, and that\nshe kissed me; but perhaps it was all a dream.\"\n\n\"It was no dream,\" I answered. \"I saw it.\"\n\n\"I am sorry to hear it--very sorry. At any rate there was the beautiful\nwoman--the Khania--for I saw her plenty of times afterwards, and talked\nto her in my best modern Greek--by the way, Ayesha knew the old Greek;\nthat's curious.\"\n\n\"She knew several of the ancient tongues, and so did other people. Go\non.\"\n\n\"Well, she nursed me very kindly, but, so far as I know, until last\nnight there was nothing more affectionate, and I had sense enough to\nrefuse to talk about our somewhat eventful past. I pretended not to\nunderstand, said that we were explorers, etc., and kept asking her where\nyou were, for I forgot to say I found that you had gone. I think that\nshe grew rather angry with me, for she wanted to know something, and, as\nyou can guess, I wanted to know a good deal. But I could get nothing out\nof her except that she was the Khania--a person in authority. There was\nno doubt about that, for when one of those slaves or servants came in\nand interrupted her while she was trying to draw the facts out of me,\nshe called to some of her people to throw him out of the window, and he\nonly saved himself by going down the stairs very quickly.\n\n\"Well, I could make nothing of her, and she could make little of me,\nthough why she should be so tenderly interested in a stranger, I don't\nknow--unless, unless--oh! who is she, Horace?\"\n\n\"If you will go on I will tell you what I think presently. One tale at a\ntime.\"\n\n\"Very good. I got quite well and strong, comparatively speaking, till\nthe climax last night, which upset me again. After that old prophet,\nSimbri, had brought me my supper, just as I was thinking of going to\nsleep, the Khania came in alone, dressed like a queen. I can tell you\nshe looked really royal, like a princess in a fairy book, with a crown\non, and her chestnut black hair flowing round her.\n\n\"Well, Horace, then she began to make love to me in a refined sort of\nway, or so I thought, looked at me and sighed, saying that we had known\neach other in the past--very well indeed I gathered--and implying that\nshe wished to continue our friendship. I fenced with her as best I\ncould; but a man feels fairly helpless lying on his back with a very\nhandsome and very imperial-looking lady standing over him and paying him\ncompliments.\n\n\"The end of it was that, driven to it by her questions and to stop that\nsort of thing, I told her that I was looking for my wife, whom I\nhad lost, for, after all, Ayesha is my wife, Horace. She smiled and\nsuggested that I need _not_ look far; in short, that the lost wife was\nalready found--in herself, who had come to save me from death in the\nriver. Indeed, she spoke with such conviction that I grew sure that she\nwas not merely amusing herself, and felt very much inclined to believe\nher, for, after all, Ayesha may be changed now.\n\n\"Then while I was at my wits' end I remembered the lock of hair--all\nthat remains to us of _her_,\" and Leo touched his breast. \"I drew it\nout and compared it with the Khania's, and at the sight of it she became\nquite different, jealous, I suppose, for it is longer than hers, and not\nin the least like.\n\n\"Horace, I tell you that the touch of that lock of hair--for she did\ntouch it--appeared to act upon her nature like nitric acid upon sham\ngold. It turned it black; all the bad in her came out. In her anger her\nvoice sounded coarse; yes, she grew almost vulgar, and, as you know,\nwhen Ayesha was in a rage she might be wicked as we understand it, and\nwas certainly terrible, but she was never either coarse or vulgar, any\nmore than lightning is.\n\n\"Well, from that moment I was sure that whoever this Khania may be, she\nhad nothing to do with Ayesha; they are so different that they never\ncould have been the same--like the hair. So I lay quiet and let her\ntalk, and coax, and threaten on, until at length she drew herself up and\nmarched from the room, and I heard her lock the door behind her. That's\nall I have to tell you, and quite enough too, for I don't think that the\nKhania has done with me, and, to say the truth, I am afraid of her.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"quite enough. Now sit still, and don't start or talk\nloud, for that steersman is probably a spy, and I can feel old Simbri's\neyes fixed upon our backs. Don't interrupt either, for our time alone\nmay be short.\"\n\nThen I set to work and told him everything I knew, while he listened in\nblank astonishment.\n\n\"Great Heavens! what a tale,\" he exclaimed as I finished. \"Now, who is\nthis Hesea who sent the letter from the Mountain? And who, who is the\nKhania?\"\n\n\"Who does your instinct tell you that she is, Leo?\"\n\n\"Amenartas?\" he whispered doubtfully. \"The woman who wrote the _Sherd_,\nwhom Ayesha said was the Egyptian princess--my wife two thousand years\nago? Amenartas re-born?\"\n\nI nodded. \"I think so. Why not? As I have told you again and again, I\nhave always been certain of one thing, that if we were allowed to see\nthe next act of the piece, we should find Amenartas, or rather the\nspirit of Amenartas, playing a leading part in it; you will remember I\nwrote as much in that record.\n\n\"If the old Buddhist monk Kou-en could remember _his_ past, as thousands\nof them swear that they do, and be sure of his identity continued from\nthat past, why should not this woman, with so much at stake, helped as\nshe is by the wizardry of the Shaman, her uncle, faintly remember hers?\n\n\"At any rate, Leo, why should she not still be sufficiently under its\ninfluence to cause her, without any fault or seeking of her own, to fall\nmadly in love at first sight with a man whom, after all, she has always\nloved?\"\n\n\"The argument seems sound enough, Horace, and if so I am sorry for the\nKhania, who hasn't much choice in the matter--been forced into it, so to\nspeak.\"\n\n\"Yes, but meanwhile your foot is in a trap again. Guard yourself,\nLeo, guard yourself. I believe that this is a trial sent to you, and\ndoubtless there will be more to follow. But I believe also that it would\nbe better for you to die than to make any mistake.\"\n\n\"I know it well,\" he answered; \"and you need not be afraid. Whatever\nthis Khania may have been to me in the past--if she was anything at\nall--that story is done with. I seek Ayesha, and Ayesha alone, and Venus\nherself shall not tempt me from her.\"\n\nThen we began to speak with hope and fear of that mysterious Hesea who\nhad sent the letter from the Mountain, commanding the Shaman Simbri to\nmeet us: the priestess or spirit whom he declared was \"mighty from of\nold\" and had \"servants in the earth and air.\"\n\nPresently the prow of our barge bumped against the bank of the river,\nand looking round I saw that Simbri had left the boat in which he sat\nand was preparing to enter ours. This he did, and, placing himself\ngravely on a seat in front of us, explained that nightfall was coming\non, and he wished to give us his company and protection through the\ndark.\n\n\"And to see that we do not give him the slip in it,\" muttered Leo.\n\nThen the drivers whipped up their ponies, and we went on again.\n\n\"Look behind you,\" said Simbri presently, \"and you will see the city\nwhere you will sleep to-night.\"\n\nWe turned ourselves, and there, about ten miles away, perceived a\nflat-roofed town of considerable, though not of very great size. Its\nposition was good, for it was set upon a large island that stood a\nhundred feet or more above the level of the plain, the river dividing\ninto two branches at the foot of it, and, as we discovered afterwards,\nuniting again beyond.\n\nThe vast mound upon which this city was built had the appearance of\nbeing artificial, but very possibly the soil whereof it was formed\nhad been washed up in past ages during times of flood, so that from\na mudbank in the centre of the broad river it grew by degrees to its\npresent proportions. With the exception of a columned and towered\nedifice that crowned the city and seemed to be encircled by gardens, we\ncould see no great buildings in the place.\n\n\"How is the city named?\" asked Leo of Simbri.\n\n\"Kaloon,\" he answered, \"as was all this land even when my fore-fathers,\nthe conquerors, marched across the mountains and took it more than two\nthousand years ago. They kept the ancient title, but the territory\nof the Mountain they called Hes, because they said that the loop upon\nyonder peak was the symbol of a goddess of this name whom their general\nworshipped.\"\n\n\"Priestesses still live there, do they not?\" said Leo, trying in his\nturn to extract the truth.\n\n\"Yes, and priests also. The College of them was established by the\nconquerors, who subdued all the land. Or rather, it took the place of\nanother College of those who fashioned the Sanctuary and the Temple,\nwhose god was the fire in the Mountain, as it is that of the people of\nKaloon to-day.\"\n\n\"Then who is worshipped there now?\"\n\n\"The goddess Hes, it is said; but we know little of the matter, for\nbetween us and the Mountain folk there has been enmity for ages. They\nkill us and we kill them, for they are jealous of their shrine, which\nnone may visit save by permission, to consult the Oracle and to make\nprayer or offering in times of calamity, when a Khan dies, or the waters\nof the river sink and the crops fail, or when ashes fall and earthquakes\nshake the land, or great sickness comes. Otherwise, unless they attack\nus, we leave them alone, for though every man is trained to arms, and\ncan fight if need be, we are a peaceful folk, who cultivate the soil\nfrom generation to generation, and thus grow rich. Look round you. Is it\nnot a scene of peace?\"\n\nWe stood up in the boat and gazed about us at the pastoral prospect.\nEverywhere appeared herds of cattle feeding upon meadow lands, or troops\nof mules and horses, or square fields sown with corn and outlined by\ntrees. Village folk, also, clad in long, grey gowns, were labouring on\nthe land, or, their day's toil finished, driving their beasts homewards\nalong roads built upon the banks of the irrigation dykes, towards the\nhamlets that were placed on rising knolls amidst tall poplar groves.\n\nIn its sharp contrast with the arid deserts and fearful mountains\namongst which we had wandered for so many years, this country struck us\nas most charming, and indeed, seen by the red light of the sinking sun\non that spring day, even as beautiful with the same kind of beauty\nwhich is to be found in Holland. One could understand too that these\nlandowners and peasant-farmers would by choice be men of peace, and what\na temptation their wealth must offer to the hungry, half-savage tribes\nof the mountains.\n\nAlso it was easy to guess when the survivors of Alexander's legions\nunder their Egyptian general burst through the iron band of snow-clad\nhills and saw this sweet country, with its homes, its herds, and its\nripening grass, that they must have cried with one voice, \"We will march\nand fight and toil no more. Here we will sit us down to live and die.\"\nThus doubtless they did, taking them wives from among the women of the\npeople of the land which they had conquered--perhaps after a single\nbattle.\n\nNow as the light faded the wreaths of smoke which hung over the distant\nFire-mountain began to glow luridly. Redder and more angry did they\nbecome while the darkness gathered, till at length they seemed to be\ncharged with pulsing sheets of flame propelled from the womb of the\nvolcano, which threw piercing beams of light through the eye of the\ngiant loop that crowned its brow. Far, far fled those beams, making\na bright path across the land, and striking the white crests of the\nbordering wall of mountains. High in the air ran that path, over the\ndim roofs of the city of Kaloon, over the river, yes, straight above\nus, over the mountains, and doubtless--though there we could not follow\nthem--across the desert to that high eminence on its farther side\nwhere we had lain bathed in their radiance. It was a wondrous and most\nimpressive sight, one too that filled our companions with fear, for the\nsteersmen in our boats and the drivers on the towing-path groaned aloud\nand began to utter prayers. \"What do they say?\" asked Leo of Simbri.\n\n\"They say, lord, that the Spirit of the Mountain is angry, and passes\ndown yonder flying light that is called the Road of Hes to work some\nevil to our land. Therefore they pray her not to destroy them.\"\n\n\"Then does that light not always shine thus?\" he asked again.\n\n\"Nay, but seldom. Once about three months ago, and now to-night, but\nbefore that not for years. Let us pray that it portends no misfortune to\nKaloon and its inhabitants.\"\n\nFor some minutes this fearsome illumination continued, then it ceased\nas suddenly as it had begun, and there remained of it only the dull glow\nabove the crest of the peak.\n\nPresently the moon rose, a white, shining ball, and by its rays we\nperceived that we drew near to the city. But there was still something\nleft for us to see before we reached its shelter. While we sat quietly\nin the boat--for the silence was broken only by the lapping of the still\nwaters against its sides and the occasional splash of the slackened\ntow-line upon their surface--we heard a distant sound as of a hunt in\nfull cry.\n\nNearer and nearer it came, its volume swelling every moment, till it\nwas quite close at last. Now echoing from the trodden earth of the\ntowing-path--not that on which our ponies travelled, but the other on\nthe west bank of the river--was heard the beat of the hoofs of a horse\ngalloping furiously. Presently it appeared, a fine, white animal, on the\nback of which sat a man. It passed us like a flash, but as he went by\nthe man lifted himself and turned his head, so that we saw his face in\nthe moonlight; saw also the agony of fear that was written on it and in\nhis eyes.\n\nHe had come out of the darkness. He was gone into the darkness, but\nafter him swelled that awful music. Look! a dog appeared, a huge, red\ndog, that dropped its foaming muzzle to the ground as it galloped, then\nlifted it and uttered a deep-throated, bell-like bay. Others followed,\nand yet others: in all there must have been a hundred of them, every one\nbaying as it took the scent.\n\n\"_The death-hounds!_\" I muttered, clasping Leo by the arm.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered, \"they are running that poor devil. Here comes the\nhuntsman.\"\n\nAs he spoke there appeared a second figure, splendidly mounted, a cloak\nstreaming from his shoulders, and in his hand a long whip, which he\nwaved. He was big but loosely jointed, and as he passed he turned his\nface also, and we saw that it was that of a madman. There could be\nno doubt of it; insanity blazed in those hollow eyes and rang in that\nsavage, screeching laugh.\n\n\"The Khan! The Khan!\" said Simbri, bowing, and I could see that he was\nafraid.\n\nNow he too was gone, and after him came his guards. I counted eight of\nthem, all carrying whips, with which they flogged their horses.\n\n\"What does this mean, friend Simbri?\" I asked, as the sounds grew faint\nin the distance.\n\n\"It means, friend Holly,\" he answered, \"that the Khan does justice in\nhis own fashion--hunting to death one that has angered him.\"\n\n\"What then is his crime? And who is that poor man?\"\n\n\"He is a great lord of this land, one of the royal kinsmen, and the\ncrime for which he has been condemned is that he told the Khania he\nloved her, and offered to make war upon her husband and kill him, if she\nwould promise herself to him in marriage. But she hated the man, as she\nhates all men, and brought the matter before the Khan. That is all the\nstory.\"\n\n\"Happy is that prince who has so virtuous a wife!\" I could not help\nsaying unctuously, but with meaning, and the old wretch of a Shaman\nturned his head at my words and began to stroke his white beard.\n\nIt was but a little while afterwards that once more we heard the baying\nof the death-hounds. Yes, they were heading straight for us, this time\nacross country. Again the white horse and its rider appeared, utterly\nexhausted, both of them, for the poor beast could scarcely struggle on\nto the towing-path. As it gained it a great red hound with a black ear\ngripped its flank, and at the touch of the fangs it screamed aloud in\nterror as only a horse can. The rider sprang from its back, and, to our\nhorror, ran to the river's edge, thinking evidently to take refuge in\nour boat. But before ever he reached the water the devilish brutes were\nupon him.\n\nWhat followed I will not describe, but never shall I forget the scene of\nthose two heaps of worrying wolves, and of the maniac Khan, who yelled\nin his fiendish joy, and cheered on his death-hounds to finish their red\nwork.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE COURT OF KALOON\n\nHorrified, sick at heart, we continued our journey. No wonder that the\nKhania hated such a mad despot. And this woman was in love with Leo,\nand this lunatic Khan, her husband, was a victim to jealousy, which he\navenged after the very unpleasant fashion that we had witnessed. Truly\nan agreeable prospect for all of us! Yet, I could not help reflecting,\nas an object lesson that horrid scene had its advantages.\n\nNow we reached the place where the river forked at the end of the\nisland, and disembarked upon a quay. Here a guard of men commanded by\nsome Household officer, was waiting to receive us. They led us through\na gate in the high wall, for the town was fortified, up a narrow,\nstone-paved street which ran between houses apparently of the usual\nCentral Asian type, and, so far as I could judge by moonlight, with no\npretensions to architectural beauty, and not large in size.\n\nClearly our arrival was expected and excited interest, for people were\ngathered in knots about the street to watch us pass; also at the windows\nof the houses and even on their flat roofs. At the top of the long\nstreet was a sort of market place, crossing which, accompanied by a\ncurious crowd who made remarks about us that we could not understand, we\nreached a gate in an inner wall. Here we were challenged, but at a\nword from Simbri it opened, and we passed through to find ourselves in\ngardens. Following a road or drive, we came to a large, rambling house\nor palace, surmounted by high towers and very solidly built of stone in\na heavy, bastard Egyptian style.\n\nBeyond its doorway we found ourselves in a courtyard surrounded by a\nkind of verandah from which short passages led to different rooms. Down\none of these passages we were conducted by the officer to an apartment,\nor rather a suite, consisting of a sitting and two bed-chambers,\nwhich were panelled, richly furnished in rather barbaric fashion, and\nwell-lighted with primitive oil lamps.\n\nHere Simbri left us, saying that the officer would wait in the outer\nroom to conduct us to the dining-hall as soon as we were ready. Then\nwe entered the bed-chambers, where we found servants, or slaves,\nquiet-mannered, obsequious men. These valets changed our foot-gear,\nand taking off our heavy travelling robes, replaced them with others\nfashioned like civilized frock-coats, but made of some white material\nand trimmed with a beautiful ermine fur.\n\nHaving dressed us in these they bowed to show that our toilette was\nfinished, and led us to the large outer room where the officer awaited\nus. He conducted us through several other rooms, all of them spacious\nand apparently unoccupied, to a great hall lit with many lamps and\nwarmed--for the nights were still cold--with large peat fires. The roof\nof this hall was flat and supported by thick, stone columns with carved\ncapitals, and its walls were hung with worked tapestries, that gave it\nan air of considerable comfort.\n\nAt the head of the hall on a dais stood a long, narrow table, spread\nwith a cloth and set with platters and cups of silver. Here we waited\ntill butlers with wands appeared through some curtains which they drew.\nThen came a man beating a silver gong, and after him a dozen or more\ncourtiers, all dressed in white robes like ourselves, followed by\nperhaps as many ladies, some of them young and good-looking, and for\nthe most part of a fair type, with well-cut features, though others were\nrather yellow-skinned. They bowed to us and we to them.\n\nThen there was a pause while we studied one another, till a trumpet blew\nand heralded by footmen in a kind of yellow livery, two figures were\nseen advancing down the passage beyond the curtains, preceded by the\nShaman Simbri and followed by other officers. They were the Khan and the\nKhania of Kaloon.\n\nNo one looking at this Khan as he entered his dining-hall clad in festal\nwhite attire would have imagined him to be the same raving human\nbrute whom we had just seen urging on his devilish hounds to tear a\nfellow-creature and a helpless horse to fragments and devour them. Now\nhe seemed a heavy, loutish man, very strongly built and not ill-looking,\nbut with shifty eyes, evidently a person of dulled intellect, whom one\nwould have thought incapable of keen emotions of any kind. The Khania\nneed not be described. She was as she had been in the chambers of the\nGate, only more weary looking; indeed her eyes had a haunted air and\nit was easy to see that the events of the previous night had left\ntheir mark upon her mind. At the sight of us she flushed a little, then\nbeckoned to us to advance, and said to her husband--\"My lord, these are\nthe strangers of whom I have told you.\"\n\nHis dull eyes fell upon me first, and my appearance seemed to amuse him\nvaguely, at any rate he laughed rudely, saying in barbarous Greek mixed\nwith words from the local patois--\"What a curious old animal! I have\nnever seen you before, have I?\"\n\n\"No, great Khan,\" I answered, \"but I have seen you out hunting this\nnight. Did you have good sport?\"\n\nInstantly he became wide awake, and answered, rubbing his\nhands--\"Excellent. He gave us a fine run, but my little dogs caught him\nat last, and then----\" and he snapped his powerful jaws together.\n\n\"Cease your brutal talk,\" broke in his wife fiercely, and he slunk away\nfrom her and in so doing stumbled against Leo, who was waiting to be\npresented to him.\n\nThe sight of this great, golden-bearded man seemed to astonish him, for\nhe stared at him, then asked--\"Are you the Khania's other friend\nwhom she went to see in the mountains of the Gate? Then I could not\nunderstand why she took so much trouble, but now I do. Well, be careful,\nor I shall have to hunt you also.\"\n\nNow Leo grew angry and was about to reply, but I laid my hand upon his\narm and said in English--\"Don't answer; the man is mad.\"\n\n\"Bad, you mean,\" grumbled Leo; \"and if he tries to set his cursed dogs\non me, I will break his neck.\"\n\nThen the Khania motioned to Leo to take a seat beside her, placing me\nupon her other hand, between herself and her uncle, the Guardian, while\nthe Khan shuffled to a chair a little way down the table, where he\ncalled two of the prettiest ladies to keep him company.\n\nSuch was our introduction to the court of Kaloon. As for the meal that\nfollowed, it was very plentiful, but coarse, consisting for the most\npart of fish, mutton, and sweetmeats, all of them presented upon huge\nsilver platters. Also much strong drink was served, a kind of spirit\ndistilled from grain, of which nearly all present drank more than was\ngood for them. After a few words to me about our journey, the Khania\nturned to Leo and talked to him for the rest of the evening, while I\ndevoted myself to the old Shaman Simbri.\n\nPut briefly, the substance of what I learned from him then and\nafterwards was as follows--Trade was unknown to the people of Kaloon,\nfor the reason that all communication with the south had been cut off\nfor ages, the bridges that once existed over the chasm having been\nallowed to rot away. Their land, which was very large and densely\ninhabited, was ringed round with unclimbable mountains, except to the\nnorth, where stood the great Fire-peak. The slopes of this Peak and an\nunvisited expanse of country behind that ran up to the confines of\na desert, were the home of ferocious mountain tribes, untamable\nHighlanders, who killed every stranger they caught. Consequently,\nalthough the precious and other metals were mined to a certain extent\nand manufactured into articles of use and ornament, money did not exist\namong the peoples either of the Plain or of the Mountain, all business\nbeing transacted on the principle of barter, and even the revenue\ncollected in kind.\n\nAmongst the tens of thousands of the aborigines of Kaloon dwelt a\nmere handful of a ruling class, who were said to be--and probably\nwere--descended from the conquerors that appeared in the time of\nAlexander. Their blood, however, was now much mixed with that of the\nfirst inhabitants, who, to judge from their appearance and the yellow\nhue of their descendants must have belonged to some branch of the great\nTartar race. The government, if so it could be called, was, on the\nwhole, of a mild though of a very despotic nature, and vested in an\nhereditary Khan or Khania, according as a man or a woman might be in the\nmost direct descent.\n\nOf religions there were two, that of the people, who worshipped the\nSpirit of the Fire Mountain, and that of the rulers, who believed in\nmagic, ghosts and divinations. Even this shadow of a religion, if so\nit can be called, was dying out, like its followers, for generation by\ngeneration, the white lords grew less in number or became absorbed in\nthe bulk of the people.\n\nStill their rule was tolerated. I asked Simbri why, seeing that they\nwere so few. He shrugged his shoulders and answered, because it suited\nthe country of which the natives had no ambition. Moreover, the present\nKhania, our hostess, was the last of the direct line of rulers, her\nhusband and cousin having less of the blood royal in his veins, and as\nsuch the people were attached to her.\n\nAlso, as is commonly the case with bold and beautiful women, she was\npopular among them, especially as she was just and very liberal to\nthe poor. These were many, as the country was over-populated, which\naccounted for its wonderful state of cultivation. Lastly they trusted to\nher skill and courage to defend them from the continual attacks of the\nMountain tribes who raided their crops and herds. Their one grievance\nagainst her was that she had no child to whom the khanship could\ndescend, which meant that after her death, as had happened after that of\nher father, there would be struggles for the succession.\n\n\"Indeed,\" added Simbri, with meaning, and glancing at Leo, out of the\ncorners of his eyes, \"the folk say openly that it would be a good thing\nif the Khan, who oppresses them and whom they hate, should die, so that\nthe Khania might take another husband while she is still young. Although\nhe is mad, he knows this, and that is why he is so jealous of any lord\nwho looks at her, as, friend Holly, you saw to-night. For should such an\none gain her favour, Rassen thinks that it would mean his death.\"\n\n\"Also he may be attached to his wife,\" I suggested, speaking in a\nwhisper.\n\n\"Perhaps so,\" answered Simbri; \"but if so, she loves not him, nor any of\nthese men,\" and he glanced round the hall.\n\nCertainly they did not look lovable, for by this time most of them were\nhalf drunk, while even the women seemed to have taken as much as was\ngood for them. The Khan himself presented a sorry spectacle, for he was\nleaning back in his chair, shouting something about his hunting, in a\nthick voice. The arm of one of his pretty companions was round his neck,\nwhile the other gave him to drink from a gold cup; some of the contents\nof which had been spilt down his white robe.\n\nJust then Atene looked round and saw him and an expression of hatred and\ncontempt gathered on her beautiful face.\n\n\"See,\" I heard her say to Leo, \"see the companion of my days, and learn\nwhat it is to be Khania of Kaloon.\"\n\n\"Then why do you not cleanse your court?\" he asked.\n\n\"Because, lord, if I did so there would be no court left. Swine will to\ntheir mire and these men and women, who live in idleness upon the toil\nof the humble folk, will to their liquor and vile luxury. Well, the end\nis near, for it is killing them, and their children are but few; weakly\nalso, for the ancient blood grows thin and stale. But you are weary and\nwould rest. To-morrow we will ride together,\" and calling to an officer,\nshe bade him conduct us to our rooms.\n\nSo we rose, and, accompanied by Simbri, bowed to her and went, she\nstanding and gazing after us, a royal and pathetic figure in the midst\nof all that dissolute revelry. The Khan rose also, and in his cunning\nfashion understood something of the meaning of it all.\n\n\"You think us gay,\" he shouted; \"and why should we not be who do not\nknow how long we have to live? But you yellow-haired fellow, you must\nnot let Atene look at you like that. I tell you she is my wife, and if\nyou do, I shall certainly have to hunt you.\"\n\nAt this drunken sally the courtiers roared with laughter, but taking Leo\nby the arm Simbri hurried him from the hall.\n\n\"Friend,\" said Leo, when we were outside, \"it seems to me that this Khan\nof yours threatens my life.\"\n\n\"Have no fear, lord,\" answered the Guardian; \"so long as the Khania does\nnot threaten it you are safe. She is the real ruler of this land, and I\nstand next to her.\"\n\n\"Then I pray you,\" said Leo, \"keep me out of the way of that drunken\nman, for, look you, if I am attacked _I_ defend myself.\"\n\n\"And who can blame you?\" Simbri replied with one of his slow, mysterious\nsmiles.\n\nThen we parted, and having placed both our beds in one chamber, slept\nsoundly enough, for we were very tired, till we were awakened in the\nmorning by the baying of those horrible death-hounds, being fed, I\nsuppose, in a place nearby.\n\nNow in this city of Kaloon it was our weary destiny to dwell for three\nlong months, one of the most hateful times, perhaps, that we ever passed\nin all our lives. Indeed, compared to it our endless wanderings amid the\nCentral Asia snows and deserts were but pleasure pilgrimages, and our\nstay at the monastery beyond the mountains a sojourn in Paradise. To set\nout its record in full would be both tedious and useless, so I will only\ntell briefly of our principal adventures.\n\nOn the morrow of our arrival the Khania Atene sent us two beautiful\nwhite horses of pure and ancient blood, and at noon we mounted them and\nwent out to ride with her accompanied by a guard of soldiers. First she\nled us to the kennels where the death-hounds were kept, great flagged\ncourts surrounded by iron bars, in which were narrow, locked gates.\nNever had I seen brutes so large and fierce; the mastiffs of Thibet were\nbut as lap-dogs compared to them. They were red and black, smooth-coated\nand with a blood-hound head, and the moment they saw us they came\nravening and leaping at the bars as an angry wave leaps against a rock.\n\nThese hounds were in the charge of men of certain families, who had\ntended them for generations. They obeyed their keepers and the Khan\nreadily enough, but no stranger might venture near them. Also these\nbrutes were the executioners of the land, for to them all murderers and\nother criminals were thrown, and with them, as we had seen, the Khan\nhunted any who had incurred his displeasure. Moreover, they were used\nfor a more innocent purpose, the chasing of certain great bucks which\nwere preserved in woods and swamps of reeds. Thus it came about that\nthey were a terror to the country, since no man knew but what in the\nend he might be devoured by them. \"Going to the dogs\" is a term full\nof meaning in any land, but in Kaloon it had a significance that was\nterrible.\n\nAfter we had looked at the hounds, not without a prophetic shudder,\nwe rode round the walls of the town, which were laid out as a kind of\nboulevard, where the inhabitants walked and took their pleasure in the\nevenings. On these, however, there was not much to see except the river\nbeneath and the plain beyond, moreover, though they were thick and\nhigh there were places in them that must be passed carefully, for, like\neverything else with which the effete ruling class had to do, they had\nbeen allowed to fall into disrepair.\n\nThe town itself was an uninteresting place also, for the most part\npeopled by hangers-on of the Court. So we were not sorry when we crossed\nthe river by a high-pitched bridge, where in days to come I was destined\nto behold one of the strangest sights ever seen by mortal man, and rode\nout into the country. Here all was different, for we found ourselves\namong the husbandmen, who were the descendants of the original owners of\nthe land and lived upon its produce. Every available inch of soil seemed\nto be cultivated by the aid of a wonderful system of irrigation. Indeed\nwater was lifted to levels where it would not flow naturally, by means\nof wheels turned with mules, or even in some places carried up by the\nwomen, who bore poles on their shoulders to which were balanced buckets.\n\nLeo asked the Khania what happened if there was a bad season. She\nreplied grimly that famine happened, in which thousands of people\nperished, and that after the famine came pestilence. These famines were\nperiodical, and were it not for them, she added, the people would long\nago have been driven to kill each other like hungry rats, since having\nno outlet and increasing so rapidly, the land, large as it was, could\nnot hold them all.\n\n\"Will this be a good year?\" I asked.\n\n\"It is feared not,\" she answered, \"for the river has not risen well and\nbut few rains have fallen. Also the light that shone last night on the\nFire-mountain is thought a bad omen, which means, they say, that the\nSpirit of the Mountain is angry and that drought will follow. Let us\nhope they will not say also that this is because strangers have visited\nthe land, bringing with them bad luck.\"\n\n\"If so,\" said Leo with a laugh, \"we shall have to fly to the Mountain to\ntake refuge there.\"\n\n\"Do you then wish to take refuge in death?\" she asked darkly. \"Of this\nbe sure, my guests, that never while I live shall you be allowed to\ncross the river which borders the slopes of yonder peak.\"\n\n\"Why not, Khania?\"\n\n\"Because, my lord Leo--that is your name, is it not?--such is my will,\nand while I rule here my will is law. Come, let us turn homewards.\"\n\nThat night we did not eat in the great hall, but in the room which\nadjoined our bed-chambers. We were not left alone, however, for the\nKhania and her uncle, the Shaman, who always attended her, joined our\nmeal. When we greeted them wondering, she said briefly that it was\narranged thus because she refused to expose us to more insults. She\nadded that a festival had begun which would last for a week, and that\nshe did not wish us to see how vile were the ways of her people.\n\nThat evening and many others which followed it--we never dined in the\ncentral hall again--passed pleasantly enough, for the Khania made Leo\ntell her of England where he was born, and of the lands that he had\nvisited, their peoples and customs. I spoke also of the history of\nAlexander, whose general Rassen, her far-off forefather, conquered the\ncountry of Kaloon, and of the land of Egypt, whence the latter came, and\nso it went on till midnight, while Atene listened to us greedily, her\neyes fixed always on Leo's face.\n\nMany such nights did we spend thus in the palace of the city of Kaloon\nwhere, in fact, we were close prisoners. But oh! the days hung heavy\non our hands. If we went into the courtyard or reception rooms of the\npalace, the lords and their followers gathered round us and pestered us\nwith questions, for, being very idle, they were also very curious.\n\nAlso the women, some of whom were fair enough, began to talk to us on\nthis pretext or on that, and did their best to make love to Leo; for,\nin contrast with their slim, delicate-looking men, they found this\ndeep-chested, yellow-haired stranger to their taste. Indeed they\ntroubled him much with gifts of flowers and messages sent by servants or\nsoldiers, making assignations with him, which of course he did not keep.\n\nIf we went out into the streets, matters were as bad, for then the\npeople ceased from their business, such as it was, and followed us\nabout, staring at us till we took refuge again in the palace gardens.\n\nThere remained, therefore, only our rides in the country with the\nKhania, but after three or four of them, these came to an end owing to\nthe jealousy of the Khan, who vowed that if we went out together any\nmore he would follow with the death-hounds. So we must ride alone, if at\nall, in the centre of a large guard of soldiers sent to see that we did\nnot attempt to escape, and accompanied very often by a mob of peasants,\nwho with threats and entreaties demanded that we should give back the\nrain which they said we had taken from them. For now the great drought\nhad begun in earnest.\n\nThus it came about that at length our only resource was making pretence\nto fish in the river, where the water was so clear and low that we could\ncatch nothing, watching the while the Fire-mountain, that loomed in the\ndistance mysterious and unreachable, and vainly racking our brains for\nplans to escape thither, or at least to communicate with its priestess,\nof whom we could learn no more.\n\nFor two great burdens lay upon our souls. The burden of desire to\ncontinue our search and to meet with its reward which we were sure that\nwe should pluck amid the snows of yonder peak, if we could but come\nthere; and the burden of approaching catastrophe at the hands of the\nKhania Atene. She had made no love to Leo since that night in the\nGateway, and, indeed, even if she had wished to, this would have been\ndifficult, since I took care that he was never left for one hour alone.\nNo duenna could have clung to a Spanish princess more closely than I did\nto Leo. Yet I could see well that her passion was no whit abated;\nthat it grew day by day, indeed, as the fire swells in the heart of a\nvolcano, and that soon it must break loose and spread its ruin round.\nThe omen of it was to be read in her words, her gestures, and her tragic\neyes.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nIN THE SHAMAN'S CHAMBER\n\nOne night Simbri asked us to dine with him in his own apartments in the\nhighest tower of the palace--had we but known it, for us a fateful place\nindeed, for here the last act of the mighty drama was destined to be\nfulfilled. So we went, glad enough of any change. When we had eaten Leo\ngrew very thoughtful, then said suddenly--\"Friend Simbri, I wish to ask\na favour of you--that you will beg the Khania to let us go our ways.\"\n\nInstantly the Shaman's cunning old face became like a mask of ivory.\n\n\"Surely you had better ask your favours of the lady herself, lord; I do\nnot think that any in reason will be refused to you,\" he replied.\n\n\"Let us stop fencing,\" said Leo, \"and consider the facts. It has seemed\nto me that the Khania Atene is not happy with her husband.\"\n\n\"Your eyes are very keen, lord, and who shall say that they have\ndeceived you?\"\n\n\"It has seemed, further,\" went on Leo, reddening, \"that she has been so\ngood as to look on me with--some undeserved regard.\"\n\n\"Ah! perhaps you guessed that in the Gate-house yonder, if you have not\nforgotten what most men would remember.\"\n\n\"I remember certain things, Simbri, that have to do with her and you.\"\n\nThe Shaman only stroked his beard and said: \"Proceed!\"\n\n\"There is little to add, Simbri, except that _I_ am not minded to bring\nscandal on the name of the first lady in your land.\"\n\n\"Nobly said, lord, nobly said, though here they do not trouble much\nabout such things. But how if the matter could be managed without\nscandal? If, for instance, the Khania chose to take another husband the\nwhole land would rejoice, for she is the last of her royal race.\"\n\n\"How can she take another husband when she has one living?\"\n\n\"True; indeed that is a question which I have considered, but the answer\nto it is that men die. It is the common lot, and the Khan has been\ndrinking very heavily of late.\"\n\n\"You mean that men can be murdered,\" said Leo angrily. \"Well, I will\nhave nothing to do with such a crime. Do you understand me?\"\n\nAs the words passed his lips I heard a rustle and turned my head. Behind\nus were curtains beyond which the Shaman slept, kept his instruments of\ndivination and worked out his horoscopes. Now they had been drawn, and\nbetween them, in her royal array, stood the Khania still as a statue.\n\n\"Who was it that spoke of crime?\" she asked in a cold voice. \"Was it\nyou, my lord Leo?\"\n\nRising from his chair, he faced her and said--\"Lady, I am glad that you\nhave heard my words, even if they should vex you.\"\n\n\"Why should it vex me to learn that there is one honest man in this\ncourt who will have naught to do with murder? Nay, I honour you for\nthose words. Know also that no such foul thoughts have come near to me.\nYet, Leo Vincey, that which is written--is written.\"\n\n\"Doubtless, Khania; but what is written?\"\n\n\"Tell him, Shaman.\"\n\nNow Simbri passed behind the curtain and returned thence with a roll\nfrom which he read: \"The heavens have declared by their signs infallible\nthat before the next new moon, the Khan Rassen will lie dead at the\nhands of the stranger lord who came to this country from across the\nmountains.\"\n\n\"Then the heavens have declared a lie,\" said Leo contemptuously.\n\n\"That is as you will,\" answered Atene; \"but so it must befall, not by my\nhand or those of my servants, but by yours. And then?\"\n\n\"Why by mine? Why not by Holly's? Yet, if so, then doubtless I shall\nsuffer the punishment of my crime at the hands of his mourning widow,\"\nhe replied exasperated.\n\n\"You are pleased to mock me, Leo Vincey, well knowing what a husband\nthis man is to me.\"\n\nNow I felt that the crisis had come, and so did Leo, for he looked her\nin the face and said--\"Speak on, lady, say all you wish; perhaps it will\nbe better for us both.\"\n\n\"I obey you, lord. Of the beginning of this fate I know nothing, but\nI read from the first page that is open to me. It has to do with this\npresent life of mine. Learn, Leo Vincey, that from my childhood onwards\nyou have haunted me. Oh! when first I saw you yonder by the river, your\nface was not strange to me, for I knew it--I knew it well in dreams.\nWhen I was a little maid and slept one day amidst the flowers by the\nriver's brim, it came first to me--ask my uncle here if this be not so,\nthough it is true that your face was younger then. Afterwards again and\nagain I saw it in my sleep and learned to know that you were mine, for\nthe magic of my heart taught me this.\n\n\"Then passed the long years while I felt that you were drawing near to\nme, slowly, very slowly, but ever drawing nearer, wending onward and\noutward through the peoples of the world; across the hills, across the\nplains, across the sands, across the snows, on to my side. At length\ncame the end, for one night not three moons ago, whilst this wise man,\nmy uncle, and I sat together here studying the lore that he has taught\nme and striving to wring its secrets from the past, a vision came to me.\n\n\"Look you, I was lost in a charmed sleep which looses the spirit from\nthe body and gives it strength to stray afar and to see those things\nthat have been and that are yet to be. Then I saw you and your companion\nclinging to a point of broken ice, over the river of the gulf. I do not\nlie; it is written here upon the scroll. Yes, it was you, the man of\nmy dreams, and no other, and we knew the place and hurried thither and\nwaited by the water, thinking that perhaps beneath it you lay dead.\n\n\"Then, while we waited, lo! two tiny figures appeared far above upon the\nicy tongue that no man may climb, and oh! you know the rest. Spellbound\nwe stood and saw you slip and hang, saw you sever the thin cord and rush\ndownwards, yes, and saw that brave man, Holly, leap headlong after you.\n\n\"But mine was the hand that drew you from the torrent, where otherwise\nyou must have drowned, you the love of the long past and of to-day, aye,\nand of all time. Yes, you and no other, Leo Vincey. It was this spirit\nthat foresaw your danger and this hand which delivered you from death,\nand--and would you refuse them now--when I, the Khania of Kaloon,\nproffer them to you?\"\n\nSo she spoke, and leaned upon the table, looking up into his face with\nlips that trembled and with appealing eyes.\n\n\"Lady,\" said Leo, \"you saved me, and again I thank you, though perhaps\nit would have been better if you had let me drown. But, forgive me the\nquestion, if all this tale be true, why did you marry another man?\"\n\nNow she shrank back as though a knife had pricked her.\n\n\"Oh! blame me not,\" she moaned, \"it was but policy which bound me to\nthis madman, whom I ever loathed. They urged me to it; yes, even you,\nSimbri, my uncle, and for that deed accursed be your head--urged me,\nsaying that it was necessary to end the war between Rassen's faction and\nmy own. That I was the last of the true race, moreover, which must be\ncarried on; saying also that my dreams and my rememberings were but\nsick phantasies. So, alas! alas! I yielded, thinking to make my people\ngreat.\"\n\n\"And yourself, the greatest of them, if all I hear is true,\" commented\nLeo bluntly, for he was determined to end this thing. \"Well, I do not\nblame you, Khania, although now you tell me that I must cut a knot\nyou tied by taking the life of this husband of your own choice, for so\nforsooth it is decreed by fate, that fate which _you_ have shaped. Yes,\nI must do what you will not do, and kill him. Also your tale of the\ndecree of the heavens and of that vision which led you to the precipice\nto save us is false. Lady, you met me by the river because the 'mighty'\nHesea, the Spirit of the Mountain, so commanded you.\"\n\n\"How know you that?\" Atene said, springing up and facing him, while the\njaw of old Simbri dropped and the eyelids blinked over his glazed eyes.\n\n\"In the same way that I know much else. Lady, it would have been better\nif you had spoken all the truth.\"\n\nNow Atene's face went ashen and her cheeks sank in.\n\n\"Who told you?\" she whispered. \"Was it you, Magician?\" and she turned\nupon her uncle like a snake about to strike. \"Oh! if so, be sure that\nI shall learn it, and though we are of one blood and have loved each\nother, I will pay you back in agony.\"\n\n\"Atene, Atene,\" Simbri broke in, holding up his claw-like hands, \"you\nknow well it was not I.\"\n\n\"Then it was you, you ape-faced wanderer, you messenger of the evil\ngods? Oh! why did I not kill you at the first? Well, that fault can be\nremedied.\"\n\n\"Lady,\" I said blandly, \"am I also a magician?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" she answered, \"I think that you are, and that you have a mistress\nwho dwells in fire.\"\n\n\"Then, Khania,\" I said, \"such servants and such mistresses are ill to\nmeddle with. Say, what answer has the Hesea sent to your report of our\ncoming to this land?\"\n\n\"Listen,\" broke in Leo before she could reply. \"I go to ask a certain\nquestion of the Oracle on yonder mountain peak. With your will or\nwithout it I tell you that I go, and afterwards you can settle which is\nthe stronger--the Khania of Kaloon or the Hesea of the House of Fire.\"\n\nAtene listened and for a while stood silent, perhaps because she had no\nanswer. Then she said with a little laugh--\"Is that your will? Well, I\nthink that yonder are none whom you would wish to wed. There is fire\nand to spare, but no lovely, shameless spirit haunts it to drive men mad\nwith evil longings;\" and as though at some secret thought, a spasm of\npain crossed her face and caught her breath. Then she went on in the\nsame cold voice--\"Wanderers, this land has its secrets, into which no\nforeigner must pry. I say to you yet again that while I live you set no\nfoot upon that Mountain. Know also, Leo Vincey, I have bared my heart to\nyou, and I have been told in answer that this long quest of yours is\nnot for me, as I was sure in my folly, but, as I think, for some demon\nwearing the shape of woman, whom you will never find. Now I make no\nprayer to you; it is not fitting, but you have learned too much.\n\n\"Therefore, consider well to-night and before next sundown answer.\nHaving offered, I do not go back, and tomorrow you shall tell me whether\nyou will take me when the time comes, as come it must, and rule this\nland and be great and happy in my love, or whether, you and your\nfamiliar together, you will--die. Choose then between the vengeance of\nAtene and her love, since I am not minded to be mocked in my own land as\na wanton who sought a stranger and was--refused.\"\n\nSlowly, slowly, in an intense whisper she spoke the words, that fell one\nby one from her lips like drops of blood from a death wound, and there\nfollowed silence. Never shall I forget the scene. There the old wizard\nwatched us through his horny eyes, that blinked like those of some night\nbird. There stood the imperial woman in her royal robes, with icy rage\nwritten on her face and vengeance in her glance. There, facing her, was\nthe great form of Leo, quiet, alert, determined, holding back his doubts\nand fears with the iron hand of will. And there to the right was _I_,\nnoting all things and wondering how long I, \"the familiar,\" who had\nearned Atene's hate, would be left alive upon the earth.\n\nThus we stood, watching each other, till suddenly I noted that the flame\nof the lamp above us flickered and felt a draught strike upon my face.\nThen I looked round, and became aware of another presence. For yonder\nin the shadow showed the tall form of a man. See! it shambled forward\nsilently, and I saw that its feet were naked. Now it reached the ring of\nthe lamplight and burst into a savage laugh.\n\nIt was the Khan.\n\nAtene, his wife, looked up and saw him, and never did I admire that\npassionate woman's boldness more, who admired little else about her save\nher beauty, for her face showed neither anger nor fear, but contempt\nonly. And yet she had some cause to be afraid, as she well knew.\n\n\"What do you here, Rassen?\" she asked, \"creeping on me with your naked\nfeet? Get you back to your drink and the ladies of your court.\"\n\nBut he still laughed on, an hyena laugh.\n\n\"What have you heard?\" she said, \"that makes you so merry?\"\n\n\"What have I heard?\" Rassen gurgled out between his screams of hideous\nglee. \"Oho! I have heard the Khania, the last of the true blood, the\nfirst in the land, the proud princess who will not let her robes be\nsoiled by those of the 'ladies of the court' and my wife, my wife,\nwho asked me to marry her--mark that, you strangers--because I was her\ncousin and a rival ruler, and the richest lord in all the land, and\nthereby she thought she would increase her power--I have heard her offer\nherself to a nameless wanderer with a great yellow beard, and I have\nheard him, who hates and would escape from her\"--here he screamed with\nlaughter--\"refuse her in such a fashion as I would not refuse the lowest\nwoman in the palace.\n\n\"I have heard also--but that I always knew--that I am mad; for,\nstrangers, I was made mad by a hate-philtre which that old Rat,\" and he\npointed to Simbri, \"gave me in my drink--yes, at my marriage feast. It\nworked well, for truly there is no one whom I hate more than the Khania\nAtene. Why, I cannot bear her touch, it makes me sick. I loathe to be\nin the same room with her; she taints the air; there is a smell of\nsorceries about her.\n\n\"It seems that it takes you thus also, Yellow-beard? Well, if so, ask\nthe old Rat for a love drink; he can mix it, and then you will think her\nsweet and sound and fair, and spend some few months jollily enough. Man,\ndon't be a fool, the cup that is thrust into your hands looks\ngoodly. Drink, drink deep. You'll never guess the liquor's bad--till\nto-morrow--though it be mixed with a husband's poisoned blood,\" and\nagain Rassen screamed in his unholy mirth.\n\nTo all these bitter insults, venomed with the sting of truth, Atene\nlistened without a word. Then, she turned to us and bowed.\n\n\"My guests,\" she said, \"I pray you pardon me for all I cannot help. You\nhave strayed to a corrupt and evil land, and there stands its crown\nand flower. Khan Rassen, your doom is written, and I do not hasten it,\nbecause once for a little while we were near to each other, though you\nhave been naught to me for this many a year save a snake that haunts\nmy house. Were it otherwise, the next cup you drank should still your\nmadness, and that vile tongue of yours which gives its venom voice. My\nuncle, come with me. Your hand, for I grow weak with shame and woe.\"\n\nThe old Shaman hobbled forward, but when he came face to face with the\nKhan he stopped and looked him up and down with his dim eyes. Then he\nsaid--\"Rassen, I saw you born, the son of an evil woman, and your father\nnone knew but I. The flame flared that night upon the Fire-mountain, and\nthe stars hid their faces, for none of them would own you, no, not even\nthose of the most evil influence. I saw you wed and rise drunken from\nyour marriage feast, your arm about a wanton's neck. I have seen you\nrule, wasting the land for your cruel pleasure, turning the fertile\nfields into great parks for your game, leaving those who tilled them to\nstarve upon the road or drown themselves in ditches for very misery.\nAnd soon, soon I shall see you die in pain and blood, and then the chain\nwill fall from the neck of this noble lady whom you revile, and another\nmore worthy shall take your place and rear up children to fill your\nthrone, and the land shall have rest again.\"\n\nNow I listened to these words--and none who did not hear them can guess\nthe fearful bitterness with which they were spoken--expecting every\nmoment that the Khan would draw the short sword at his side and cut the\nold man down. But he did not; he cowered before him like a dog before\nsome savage master, the weight of whose whip he knows. Yes, answering\nnothing, he shrank into the corner and cowered there, while Simbri,\ntaking Atene by the hand, went from the room. At its massive, iron-bound\ndoor he turned and pointing to the crouching figure with his staff,\nsaid--\"Khan Rassen, I raised you up, and now I cast you down. Remember\nme when you lie dying--in blood and pain.\"\n\nTheir footsteps died away, and the Khan crept from his corner, looking\nabout him furtively.\n\n\"Have that Rat and the other gone?\" he asked of us, wiping his damp brow\nwith his sleeve; and I saw that fear had sobered him and that for awhile\nthe madness had left his eyes.\n\nI answered that they had gone.\n\n\"You think me a coward,\" he went on passionately, \"and it is true, I am\nafraid of him and her--as you, Yellow-beard, will be afraid when your\nturn comes. I tell you that they sapped my strength and crazed me with\ntheir drugged drink, making me the thing I am, for who can war against\ntheir wizardries? Look you now. Once I was a prince, the lord of half\nthis land, noble of form and upright of heart, and I loved her accursed\nbeauty as all must love it on whom she turns her eyes. And she turned\nthem on me, she sought _me_ in marriage; it was that old Rat who bore\nher message.\n\n\"So I stayed the great war and married the Khania and became the Khan;\nbut better had it been for me if I had crept into her kitchen as a\nscullion, than into her chamber as a husband. For from the first she\nhated me, and the more I loved, the more she hated, till at our wedding\nfeast she doctored me with that poison which made me loathe her, and\nthus divorced us; which made me mad also, eating into my brain like\nfire.\"\n\n\"If she hated you so sorely, Khan,\" I asked, \"why did she not mix a\nstronger draught and have done with you?\"\n\n\"Why? Because of policy, for I ruled half the land. Because it suited\nher also that I should live on, a thing to mock at, since while I was\nalive no other husband could be forced upon her by the people. For\nshe is not a woman, she is a witch, who desires to live alone, or so I\nthought until to-night\"--and he glowered at Leo.\n\n\"She knew also that although I must shrink from her, I still love her in\nmy heart, and can still be jealous, and therefore that I should protect\nher from all men. It was she who set me on that lord whom my dogs tore\nawhile ago, because he was powerful and sought her favour and would not\nbe denied. But now,\" and again he glowered at Leo, \"now I know why she\nhas always seemed so cold. It is because there lived a man to melt whose\nice she husbanded her fire.\"\n\nThen Leo, who all this while had stood silent, stepped forward.\n\n\"Listen, Khan,\" he said. \"Did the ice seem like melting a little while\nago?\"\n\n\"No--unless you lied. But that was only because the fire is not yet hot\nenough. Wait awhile until it burns up, and melt you must, for who can\nmatch his will against Atene?\"\n\n\"And what if the ice desires to flee the fire? Khan, they said that I\nshould kill you, but I do not seek your blood. You think that I would\nrob you of your wife, yet I have no such thought towards her. We desire\nto escape this town of yours, but cannot, because its gates are locked,\nand we are prisoners, guarded night and day. Hear me, then. You have the\npower to set us free and to be rid of us.\"\n\nThe Khan looked at him cunningly. \"And if I set you free, whither would\nyou go? You could tumble down yonder gorge, but only the birds can climb\nits heights.\"\n\n\"To the Fire-mountain, where we have business.\"\n\nRassen stared at him.\n\n\"Is it I who am mad, or are you, who wish to visit the Fire-mountain?\nYet that is nothing to me, save that I do not believe you. But if so\nyou might return again and bring others with you. Perchance, having\nits lady, you wish this land also by right of conquest. It has foes up\nyonder.\"\n\n\"It is not so,\" answered Leo earnestly. \"As one man to another, I tell\nyou it is not so. _I_ ask no smile of your wife and no acre of your\nsoil. Be wise and help us to be gone, and live on undisturbed in such\nfashion as may please you.\"\n\nThe Khan stood still awhile, swinging his long arms vacantly, till\nsomething seemed to come into his mind that moved him to merriment, for\nhe burst into one of his hideous laughs.\n\n\"I am thinking,\" he said, \"what Atene would say if she woke up to find\nher sweet bird flown. She would search for you and be angry with me.\"\n\n\"It seems that she cannot be angrier than she is,\" I answered. \"Give us\na night's start and let her search never so closely, she shall not find\nus.\"\n\n\"You forget, Wanderer, that she and her old Rat have arts. Those who\nknew where to meet you might know where to seek you. And yet, and yet,\nit would be rare to see her rage. 'Oh, Yellow-beard, where are you,\nYellow-beard?' he went on, mimicking his wife's voice. 'Come back and\nlet me melt your ice, Yellow-beard.'\"\n\nAgain he laughed; then said suddenly--\"When can you be ready?\"\n\n\"In half an hour,\" I answered.\n\n\"Good. Go to your chambers and prepare. I will join you there\npresently.\"\n\nSo we went.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE HUNT AND THE KILL\n\nWe reached our rooms, meeting no one in the passages, and there made\nour preparations. First we changed our festal robes for those warmer\ngarments in which we had travelled to the city of Kaloon. Then we ate\nand drank what we could of the victuals which stood in the antechamber,\nnot knowing when we should find more food, and filled two satchels such\nas these people sling about their shoulders, with the remains of the\nmeat and liquor and a few necessaries. Also we strapped our big hunting\nknives about our middles and armed ourselves with short spears that were\nmade for the stabbing of game.\n\n\"Perhaps he has laid a plot to murder us, and we may as well defend\nourselves while we can,\" suggested Leo.\n\nI nodded, for the echoes of the Khan's last laugh still rang in my ears.\nIt was a very evil laugh.\n\n\"Likely enough,\" I said. \"I do not trust that insane brute. Still, he\nwishes to be rid of us.\"\n\n\"Yes, but as he said, live men may return, whereas the dead do not.\"\n\n\"Atene thinks otherwise,\" I commented.\n\n\"And yet she threatened us with death,\" answered Leo.\n\n\"Because her shame and passion make her mad,\" I replied, after which we\nwere silent.\n\nPresently the door opened, and through it came the Khan, muffled in a\ngreat cloak as though to disguise himself.\n\n\"Come,\" he said, \"if you are ready.\" Then, catching sight of the spears\nwe held, he added: \"You will not need those things. You do not go\na-hunting.\"\n\n\"No,\" I answered, \"but who can say--we might be hunted.\"\n\n\"If you believe that perhaps you had best stay where you are till the\nKhania wearies of Yellow-beard and opens the gates for you,\" he replied,\neyeing me with his cunning glance.\n\n\"I think not,\" I said, and we started, the Khan leading the way and\nmotioning us to be silent.\n\nWe passed through the empty rooms on to the verandah, and from the\nverandah down into the courtyard, where he whispered to us to keep in\nthe shadow. For the moon shone very clearly that night, so clearly, I\nremember, that I could see the grass which grew between the joints of\nthe pavement, and the little shadows thrown by each separate blade upon\nthe worn surface of its stones. Now I wondered how we should pass the\ngate, for there a guard was stationed, which had of late been doubled by\norder of the Khania. But this gate we left upon our right, taking a path\nthat led into the great walled garden, where Rassen brought us to a\ndoor hidden behind a clump of shrubs, which he unlocked with a key he\ncarried.\n\nNow we were outside the palace wall, and our road ran past the kennels.\nAs we went by these, the great, sleepless death-hounds, that wandered\nto and fro like prowling lions, caught our wind and burst into a sudden\nchorus of terrific bays. I shivered at the sound, for it was fearful in\nthat silence, also I thought that it would arouse the keepers. But the\nKhan went to the bars and showed himself, whereon the brutes, which knew\nhim, ceased their noise.\n\n\"Fear not,\" he said as he returned, \"the huntsmen know that they are\nstarved to-night, for to-morrow certain criminals will be thrown to\nthem.\"\n\nNow we had reached the palace gates. Here the Khan bade us hide in an\narchway and departed. We looked at each other, for the same thought was\nin both our minds--that he had gone to fetch the murderers who were to\nmake an end of us. But in this we did him wrong, for presently we heard\nthe sound of horses' hoofs upon the stones, and he returned leading the\ntwo white steeds that Atene had given us.\n\n\"I saddled them with my own hands,\" he whispered. \"Who can do more to\nspeed the parting guest? Now mount, hide your faces in your cloaks as I\ndo, and follow me.\"\n\nSo we mounted, and he trotted before us like a running footman, such as\nthe great lords of Kaloon employed when they went about their business\nor their pleasure. Leaving the main street, he led us through a quarter\nof the town that had an evil reputation, and down its tortuous by-ways.\nHere we met a few revellers, while from time to time night-birds flitted\nfrom the doorways and, throwing aside their veils, looked at us, but\nas we made no sign drew back again, thinking that we passed to some\nassignation. We reached the deserted docks upon the river's edge\nand came to a little quay, alongside of which a broad ferryboat was\nfastened.\n\n\"You must put your horses into it and row across,\" Rassen said, \"for\nthe bridges are guarded, and without discovering myself I cannot bid the\nsoldiers to let you pass.\"\n\nSo with some little trouble we urged the horses into the boat, where I\nheld them by their bridles while Leo took the oars.\n\n\"Now go your ways, accursed wanderers,\" cried the Khan as he thrust us\nfrom the quay, \"and pray the Spirit of the Mountain that the old Rat and\nhis pupil--your love, Yellow-beard, your love--are not watching you in\ntheir magic glass. For if so we may meet again.\"\n\nThen as the stream caught us, sweeping the boat out towards the centre\nof the river, he began to laugh that horrible laugh of his, calling\nafter us--\"Ride fast, ride fast for safety, strangers; there is death\nbehind.\"\n\nLeo put out his strength and backed water, so that the punt hung upon\nthe edge of the stream.\n\n\"I think that we should do well to land again and kill that man, for he\nmeans mischief,\" he said.\n\nHe spoke in English, but Rassen must have caught the ring of his\nvoice and guessed its meaning with the cunning of the mad. At least he\nshouted--\"Too late, fools,\" and with a last laugh turned, ran so\nswiftly up the quay that his cloak flew out upon the air behind him, and\nvanished into the shadows at its head.\n\n\"Row on,\" I said, and Leo bent himself to the oars.\n\nBut the ferry-boat was cumbersome and the current swift, so that we were\nswept down a long way before we could cross it. At length we reached\nstill water near the further shore, and seeing a landing-place, managed\nto beach the punt and to drag our horses to the bank. Then leaving the\ncraft to drift, for we had no time to scuttle her, we looked to our\ngirths and bridles, and mounted, heading towards the far column of\nglowing smoke which showed like a beacon above the summit of the House\nof Fire.\n\nAt first our progress was very slow, for here there seemed to be no\npath, and we were obliged to pick our way across the fields, and to\nsearch for bridges that spanned such of the water-ditches as were too\nwide for us to jump. More than an hour was spent in this work, till we\ncame to a village wherein none were stirring, and here struck a\nroad which seemed to run towards the mountain, though, as we learned\nafterwards, it took us very many miles out of our true path. Now for the\nfirst time we were able to canter, and pushed on at some speed, though\nnot too fast, for we wished to spare our horses and feared lest they\nmight fall in the uncertain light.\n\nA while before dawn the moon sank behind the Mountain, and the gloom\ngrew so dense that we were forced to stop, which we did, holding the\nhorses by their bridles and allowing them to graze a little on some\nyoung corn. Then the sky turned grey, the light faded from the column\nof smoke that was our guide, the dawn came, blushing red upon the vast\nsnows of the distant peak, and shooting its arrows through the loop\nabove the pillar. We let the horses drink from a channel that watered\nthe corn, and, mounting them, rode onward slowly.\n\nNow with the shadows of the night a weight of fear seemed to be lifted\noff our hearts and we grew hopeful, aye, almost joyous. That hated city\nwas behind us. Behind us were the Khania with her surging, doom-driven\npassions and her stormy loveliness, the wizardries of her horny-eyed\nmentor, so old in years and secret sin, and the madness of that strange\nbeing, half-devil, half-martyr, at once cruel and a coward--the Khan,\nher husband, and his polluted court. In front lay the fire, the snow and\nthe mystery they hid, sought for so many empty years. Now we would solve\nit or we would die. So we pressed forward joyfully to meet our fate,\nwhatever it might be.\n\nFor many hours our road ran deviously through cultivated land, where the\npeasants at their labour laid down their tools and gathered into knots\nto watch us pass, and quaint, flat-roofed villages, whence the women\nsnatched up their children and fled at the sight of us. They believed us\nto be lords from the court who came to work them some harm in person or\nin property, and their terror told _us_ how the country smarted beneath\nthe rod of the oppressor. By mid-day, although the peak seemed to be\nbut little nearer, the character of the land had changed. Now it sloped\ngently upwards, and therefore could not be irrigated.\n\nEvidently all this great district was dependent on the fall of\ntimely rains, which had not come that spring. Therefore, although the\npopulation was still dense and every rod of the land was under the\nplough or spade, the crops were failing. It was pitiful to see the\ngreen, uneared corn already turning yellow because of the lack of\nmoisture, the beasts searching the starved pastures for food and the\npoor husbandmen wandering about their fields or striving to hoe the iron\nsoil.\n\nHere the people seemed to know us as the two foreigners whose coming had\nbeen noised abroad, and, the fear of famine having made them bold, they\nshouted at us as we went by to give them back the rain which we had\nstolen, or so we understood their words. Even the women and the children\nin the villages prostrated themselves before us, pointing first to the\nMountain and then to the hard, blue sky, and crying to us to send them\nrain. Once, indeed, we were threatened by a mob of peasants armed with\nspades and reaping-hooks, who seemed inclined to bar our path, so that\nwe were obliged to put our horses to a gallop and pass through them\nwith a rush. As we went forward the country grew ever more arid and its\ninhabitants more scarce, till we saw no man save a few wandering herds\nwho drove their cattle from place to place in search of provender.\n\nBy evening we guessed that we had reached that border tract which was\nharried by the Mountain tribes, for here strong towers built of stone\nwere dotted about the heaths, doubtless to serve as watch-houses or\nplaces of refuge. Whether they were garrisoned by soldiers I do not\nknow, but I doubt it, for we saw none. It seems probable indeed that\nthese forts were relics of days when the land of Kaloon was guarded from\nattack by rulers of a very different character to that of the present\nKhan and his immediate predecessors.\n\nAt length even the watch-towers were left behind, and by sundown we\nfound ourselves upon a vast uninhabited plain, where we could see\nno living thing. Now we made up our minds to rest our horses awhile,\nproposing to push forward again with the moon, for having the wrath\nof the Khania behind us we did not dare to linger. By this evening\ndoubtless she would have discovered our escape, since before sundown, as\nshe had decreed, Leo must make his choice and give his answer. Then,\nas we were sure, she would strike swiftly. Perhaps her messengers\nwere already at their work rousing the country to capture us, and her\nsoldiers following on our path.\n\nWe unsaddled the horses and let them refresh themselves by rolling\non the sandy soil, and graze after a fashion upon the coarse tufts of\nwithering herbage which grew around. There was no water here; but this\ndid not so much matter, for both they and we had drunk at a little muddy\npool we found not more than an hour before. We were finishing our meal\nof the food that we had brought with us, which, indeed, we needed sorely\nafter our sleepless night and long day's journey, when my horse, which\nwas knee-haltered close at hand, lay down to roll again. This it could\nnot do with ease because of the rope about its fore-leg, and I watched\nits efforts idly, till at length, at the fourth attempt, after hanging\nfor a few seconds upon its back, its legs sticking straight into the\nair, it fell over slowly towards me as horses do.\n\n\"Why are its hoofs so red? Has it cut itself?\" asked Leo in an\nindifferent voice.\n\nAs it chanced I also had just noticed this red tinge, and for the first\ntime, since it was most distinct about the animal's frogs, which until\nit rolled thus I had not seen. So I rose to look at them, thinking that\nprobably the evening light had deceived us, or that we might have passed\nthrough some ruddy-coloured mud. Sure enough they _were_ red, as though\na dye had soaked into the horn and the substance of the frogs. What was\nmore, they gave out a pungent, aromatic smell that was unpleasant, such\na smell as might arise from blood mixed with musk and spices.\n\n\"It is very strange,\" I said. \"Let us look at your beast, Leo.\"\n\nSo we did, and found that its hoofs had been similarly-treated.\n\n\"Perhaps it is a native mixture to preserve the horn,\" suggested Leo.\n\nI thought awhile, then a terrible idea struck me.\n\n\"I don't want to frighten you,\" I said, \"but I think that we had better\nsaddle up and get on.\"\n\n\"Why?\" he asked.\n\n\"Because I believe that villain of a Khan has doctored our horses.\"\n\n\"What for? To make them go lame?\"\n\n\"No, Leo, to make them leave a strong scent upon dry ground.\"\n\nHe turned pale. \"Do you mean--those hounds?\"\n\nI nodded. Then wasting no more time in words, we saddled up in frantic\nhaste. Just as I fastened the last strap of my saddle I thought that a\nfaint sound reached my ear.\n\n\"Listen,\" I said. Again it came, and now there was no doubt about it. It\nwas the sound of baying dogs.\n\n\"By heaven! the death-hounds,\" said Leo.\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered quietly enough, for at this crisis my nerves hardened\nand all fear left me, \"our friend the Khan is out a-hunting. That is why\nhe laughed.\"\n\n\"What shall we do?\" asked Leo. \"Leave the horses?\"\n\nI looked at the Peak. Its nearest flanks were miles and miles away.\n\n\"Time enough to do that when we are forced. We can never reach that\nmountain on foot, and after they had run down the horses, they would\nhunt us by spoor or gaze. No, man, ride as you never rode before.\"\n\nWe sprang to our saddles, but before we gave rein I turned and looked\nbehind me. It will be remembered that we had ridden up a long slope\nwhich terminated in a ridge, about three miles away, the border of the\ngreat plain whereon we stood. Now the sun had sunk behind that ridge\nso that although it was still light the plain had fallen into shadow.\nTherefore, while no distant object could be seen upon the plain,\nanything crossing the ridge remained visible enough in that clear air,\nat least to persons of keen sight.\n\nThis is what we saw. Over the ridge poured a multitude of little\nobjects, and amongst the last of these galloped a man mounted on a great\nhorse, who led another horse by the bridle.\n\n\"All the pack are out,\" said Leo grimly, \"and Rassen has brought a\nsecond mount with him. Now I see why he wanted us to leave the spears,\nand I think,\" he shouted as we began to gallop, \"that before all is done\nthe Shaman may prove himself a true prophet.\"\n\nAway we sped through the gathering darkness, heading straight for the\nPeak. While we went I calculated our chances. Our horses, as good as any\nin the land, were still strong and fresh, for although we had ridden\nfar we had not over-pressed them, and their condition was excellent. But\ndoubtless the death-hounds were fresh also, for, meaning to run us down\nat night when he thought that he might catch us sleeping, Rassen would\nhave brought them along easily, following us by inquiry among the\npeasants and only laying them on our spoor after the last village had\nbeen left behind.\n\nAlso he had two mounts, and for aught we knew--though afterwards this\nproved not to be the case, for he wished to work his wickedness alone\nand unseen--he might be followed by attendants with relays. Therefore it\nwould appear that unless we reached some place whither he did not dare\nto follow, before him--that is the slopes of the Peak many miles away,\nhe must run us down. There remained the chance also that the dogs would\ntire and refuse to pursue the chase.\n\nThis, however, seemed scarcely probable, for they were extraordinarily\nswift and strong, and so savage that when once they had scented blood,\nin which doubtless our horses' hoofs were steeped, they would fall dead\nfrom exhaustion sooner than abandon the trail. Indeed, both the Khania\nand Simbri had often told us as much. Another chance--they might lose\nthe scent, but seeing its nature, again this was not probable. Even an\nEnglish pack will carry the trail of a red herring breast high without a\nfault for hours, and here was something stronger--a cunning compound of\nwhich the tell-tale odour would hold for days. A last chance. If we were\nforced to abandon our horses, we, their riders, might possibly escape,\ncould we find any place to hide in on that great plain. If not, we\nshould be seen as well as scented, and then----No, the odds were all\nagainst us, but so they had often been before; meanwhile we had three\nmiles start, and perhaps help would come to us from the Mountain, some\nhelp unforeseen. So we set our teeth and sped away like arrows while the\nlight lasted.\n\nVery soon it failed, and whilst the moon was hidden behind the mountains\nthe night grew dark.\n\nNow the hounds gained on us, for in the gloom, which to them was\nnothing, we did not dare to ride full speed, fearing lest our horses\nshould stumble and lame themselves, or fall. Then it was for the second\ntime since we had dwelt in this land of Kaloon that of a sudden the fire\nflamed upon the Peak. When we had seen it before, it had appeared to\nflash across the heavens in one great lighthouse ray, concentrated\nthrough the loop above the pillar, and there this night also the ray ran\nfar above us like a lance of fire. But now that we were nearer to its\nfount we found ourselves bathed in a soft, mysterious radiance like that\nof the phosphorescence on a summer sea, reflected downwards perhaps from\nthe clouds and massy rock roof of the column loop and diffused by the\nsnows beneath.\n\nThis unearthly glimmer, faint as it was, helped us much, indeed but for\nit we must have been overtaken, for here the ground was very rough, full\nof holes also made by burrowing marmots. Thus in our extremity help did\ncome to us from the Mountain, until at length the moon rose, when as\nquickly as they had appeared the volcanic fires vanished, leaving behind\nthem nothing but the accustomed pillar of dull red smoke.\n\nIt is a commonplace to speak of the music of hounds at chase, but often\nI have wondered how that music sounds in the ears of the deer or the fox\nfleeing for its life.\n\nNow, when we filled the place of the quarry, it was my destiny to solve\nthis problem, and I assert with confidence that the progeny of earth\ncan produce no more hideous noise. It had come near to us, and in the\ndesolate silence of the night the hellish harmonies of its volume\nseemed terrific, yet I could discern the separate notes of which it was\ncomposed, especially one deep, bell-like bay.\n\nI remembered that I had heard this bay when we sat in the boat upon the\nriver and saw that poor noble done to death for the crime of loving the\nKhania. As the hunt passed us then I observed that it burst from\nthe throat of the leading hound, a huge brute, red in colour, with\na coal-black ear, fangs that gleamed like ivory, and a mouth which\nresembled a hot oven. I even knew the name of the beast, for afterwards\nthe Khan, whose peculiar joy it was, had pointed it out to me. He called\nit Master, because no dog in the pack dared fight it, and told me that\nit could kill an armed man alone.\n\nNow, as its baying warned us, Master was not half a mile away!\n\nThe coming of the moonlight enabled us to gallop faster, especially as\nhere the ground was smooth, being covered with a short, dry turf, and\nfor the next two hours we gained upon the pack. Yes, it was only two\nhours, or perhaps less, but it seemed a score of centuries. The slopes\nof the Peak were now not more than ten miles ahead, but our horses were\ngiving out at last. They had borne us nobly, poor beasts, though we were\nno light weights, yet their strength had its limits. The sweat ran from\nthem, their sides panted like bellows, they breathed in gasps, they\nstumbled and would scarcely answer to the flogging of our spear-shafts.\nTheir gallop sank to a jolting canter, and I thought that soon they must\ncome to a dead stop.\n\nWe crossed the brow of a gentle rise, from which the ground, that was\nsprinkled with bush and rocks, sloped downwards to where, some miles\nbelow us, the river ran, bounding the enormous flanks of the Mountain.\nWhen we had travelled a little way down this slope we were obliged to\nturn in order to pass between two heaps of rock, which brought us side\non to its brow. And there, crossing it not more than three hundred yards\naway, we saw the pack. There were fewer of them now; doubtless many\nhad fallen out of the hunt, but many still remained. Moreover, not far\nbehind them rode the Khan, though his second mount was gone, or more\nprobably he was riding it, having galloped the first to a standstill.\n\nOur poor horses saw them also, and the sight lent them wings, for all\nthe while they knew that they were running for their lives. This we\ncould tell from the way they quivered whenever the baying came near\nto them, not as horses tremble with the pleasureable excitement of the\nhunt, but in an extremity of terror, as I have often seen them do when\na prowling tiger roars close to their camp. On they went as though they\nwere fresh from the stable, nor did they fail again until another four\nmiles or so were covered and the river was but a little way ahead, for\nwe could hear the rush of its waters.\n\nThen slowly but surely the pack overtook us. We passed a clump of bush,\nbut when we had gone a couple of hundred yards or so across the open\nplain beyond, feeling that the horses were utterly spent, I shouted\nto Leo--\"Ride round back to the bush and hide there.\" So we did, and\nscarcely had we reached it and dismounted when the hounds came past.\nYes, they went within fifty yards of us, lolloping along upon our spoor\nand running all but mute, for now they were too weary to waste their\nbreath in vain. \"Run for it,\" I said to Leo as soon as they had gone by,\n\"for they will be back on the scent presently,\" and we set off to the\nright across the line that the hounds had taken, so as not to cut our\nown spoor.\n\nAbout a hundred yards away was a rock, which fortunately we were able to\nreach before the pack swung round upon the horses' tracks, and therefore\nthey did not view us. Here we stayed until following the loop, they came\nto the patch of bush and passed behind it. Then we ran forward again as\nfar as we could go. Glancing backwards as we went, I saw our two poor,\nfoundered beasts plunging away across the plain, happily almost in the\nsame line along which we had ridden from the rise. They were utterly\ndone, but freed from our weights and urged on by fear, could still\ngallop and keep ahead of the dogs, though we knew that this would not\nbe for very long. I saw also that the Khan, guessing what we had done\nin our despair, was trying to call his hounds off the horses, but as\nyet without avail, for they would not leave the quarry which they had\nviewed.\n\nAll this came to my sight in a flash, but I remember the picture well.\nThe mighty, snow-clad Peak surmounted by its column of glowing smoke and\ncasting its shadow for mile upon mile across the desert flats; the plain\nwith its isolated rocks and grey bushes; the doomed horses struggling\nacross it with convulsive bounds; the trailing line of great dogs that\nloped after them, and amongst these, looking small and lonely in that\nvast place, the figure of the Khan and his horse, of which the black\nhide was beflecked with foam. Then above, the blue and tender sky,\nwhere the round moon shone so clearly that in her quiet, level light no\ndetail, even the smallest, could escape the eye.\n\nNow youth and even middle age were far behind me, and although a very\nstrong man for my years, I could not run as I used to do. Also I was\nmost weary, and my limbs were stiff and chafed with long riding, so\nI made but slow progress, and to worsen matters I struck my left foot\nagainst a stone and hurt it much. I implored Leo to go on and leave me,\nfor we thought that if we could once reach the river our scent would be\nlost in the water; at any rate that it would give us a chance of life.\nJust then too, I heard the belling bay of the hound Master, and waited\nfor the next. Yes, it was nearer to us. The Khan had made a cast and\nfound our line. Presently we must face the end.\n\n\"Go, go!\" I said. \"I can keep them back for a few minutes and you may\nescape. It is your quest, not mine. Ayesha awaits you, not me, and I am\nweary of life. I wish to die and have done with it.\"\n\nThus I gasped, not all at once, but in broken words, as I hobbled along\nclinging to Leo's arm. But he only answered in a low voice--\"Be quiet,\nor they will hear you,\" and on he went, dragging me with him.\n\nWe were quite near the water now, for we could see it gleaming below us,\nand oh! how I longed for one deep drink. I remember that this was the\nuppermost desire in my mind, to drink and drink. But the hounds were\nnearer still to us, so near that we could hear the pattering of their\nfeet on the dry ground mingled with the thud of the hoofs of the Khan's\ngalloping horse. We had reached some rocks upon a little rise, just\nwhere the bank began, when Leo said suddenly--\"No use, we can't make it.\nStop and let's see the thing through.\"\n\nSo we wheeled round, resting our backs against the rock. There, about a\nhundred yards off, were the death-hounds, but Heaven be praised! _only\nthree of them_. The rest had followed the flying horses, and doubtless\nwhen they caught them at last, which may have been far distant, had\nstopped to gorge themselves upon them. So they were out of the fight.\nOnly three, and the Khan, a wild figure, who galloped with them; but\nthose three, the black and red brute, Master, and two others almost as\nfierce and big.\n\n\"It might be worse,\" said Leo. \"If you will try to tackle the dogs, I'll\ndo my best with the Khan,\" and stooping down he rubbed his palms in the\ngrit, for they were wet as water, an example which I followed. Then we\ngripped the spears in our right hands and the knives in our left, and\nwaited.\n\nThe dogs had seen us now and came on, growling and baying fearfully.\nWith a rush they came, and I am not ashamed to own that I felt terribly\nafraid, for the brutes seemed the size of lions and more fierce. One,\nit was the smallest of them, outstripped the others, and, leaping up the\nlittle rise, sprang straight at my throat.\n\nWhy or how I do not know, but on the impulse of the moment I too sprang\nto meet it, so that its whole weight came upon the point of my spear,\nwhich was backed by my weight. The spear entered between its forelegs\nand such was the shock that I was knocked backwards. But when I regained\nmy feet I saw the dog rolling on the ground before me and gnashing at\nthe spear shaft, which had been twisted from my hand.\n\nThe other two had jumped at Leo, but failed to get hold, though one of\nthem tore away a large fragment from his tunic. Foolishly enough, he\nhurled his spear at it but missed, for the steel passed just under its\nbelly and buried itself deep in the ground. The pair of them did not\ncome on again at once. Perhaps the sight of their dying companion made\nthem pause. At any rate, they stood at a little distance snarling,\nwhere, as our spears were gone, they were safe from us.\n\nNow the Khan had ridden up and sat upon his horse glowering at us, and\nhis face was like the face of a devil. I had hoped that he might fear to\nattack, but the moment I saw his eyes, I knew that this would not be. He\nwas quite mad with hate, jealousy, and the long-drawn excitement of the\nhunt, and had come to kill or be killed. Sliding from the saddle, he\ndrew his short sword--for either he had lost his spear or had brought\nnone--and made a hissing noise to the two dogs, pointing at me with the\nsword. I saw them spring and I saw him rush at Leo, and after that who\ncan tell exactly what happened?\n\nMy knife went home to the hilt in the body of one dog--and it came to\nthe ground and lay there--for its hindquarters were paralysed, howling,\nsnarling and biting at me. But the other, the fiend called Master, got\nme by the right arm beneath the elbow, and I felt my bones crack in its\nmighty jaws, and the agony of it, or so I suppose, caused me to drop the\nknife, so that I was weaponless. The brute dragged me from the rock and\nbegan to shake and worry me, although I kicked it in the stomach with\nall my strength. I fell to my knees and, as it chanced, my left hand\ncame upon a stone of about the size of a large orange, which I gripped.\nI gained my feet again and pounded at its skull with the stone, but\nstill it did not leave go, and this was well for me, for its next hold\nwould have been on my throat.\n\nWe twisted and tumbled to and fro, man and dog together. At one turn\nI thought that I saw Leo and the Khan rolling over and over each other\nupon the ground; at another, that he, the Khan, was sitting against a\nstone looking at me, and it came into my mind that he must have killed\nLeo and was watching while the dog worried me to death.\n\nThen just as things began to grow black, something sprang forward and I\nsaw the huge hound lifted from the earth. Its jaws opened, my arm came\nfree and fell against my side. Yes! the brute was whirling round in\nthe air. Leo held it by its hind legs and with all his great strength\nwhirled it round and round.\n\n_Thud!_\n\nHe had dashed its head against the rock, and it fell and lay still, a\nhuddled heap of black and red. Oddly enough, I did not faint; I suppose\nthat the pain and the shock to my nerves kept me awake, for I heard\nLeo say in a matter-of-fact voice between his gasps for breath--\"Well,\nthat's over, and I think that I have fulfilled the Shaman's prophecy.\nLet's look and make sure.\"\n\nThen he led me with him to one of the rocks, and there, resting supinely\nagainst it, sat the Khan, still living but unable to move hand or foot.\nThe madness had quite left his face and he looked at us with melancholy\neyes, like the eyes of a sick child.\n\n\"You are brave men,\" he said, slowly, \"strong also, to have killed those\nhounds and broken my back. So it has come about as was foretold by the\nold Rat. After all, I should have hunted Atene, not you, though now she\nlives to avenge me, for her own sake, not mine. Yellow-beard, she hunts\nyou too and with deadlier hounds than these, those of her thwarted\npassions. Forgive me and fly to the Mountain, Yellow-beard, whither I go\nbefore you, for there one dwells who is stronger than Atene.\"\n\nThen his jaw dropped and he was dead.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHE MESSENGER\n\n\"He is gone,\" I panted, \"and the world hasn't lost much.\"\n\n\"Well, it didn't give him much, did it, poor devil, so don't let's\nspeak ill of him,\" answered Leo, who had thrown himself exhausted to the\nground. \"Perhaps he was all right before they made him mad. At any rate\nhe had pluck, for I don't want to tackle such another.\"\n\n\"How did you manage it?\" I asked.\n\n\"Dodged in beneath his sword, closed with him, threw him and smashed\nhim up over that lump of stone. Sheer strength, that's all. A cruel\nbusiness, but it was his life or mine, and there you are. It's lucky I\nfinished it in time to help you before that oven-mouthed brute tore your\nthroat out. Did you ever see such a dog? It looks as large as a young\ndonkey. Are you much hurt, Horace?\"\n\n\"Oh, my forearm is chewed to a pulp, but nothing else, I think. Let us\nget down to the water; if I can't drink soon I shall faint. Also the\nrest of the pack is somewhere about, fifty or more of them.\"\n\n\"I don't think they will trouble us, they have got the horses, poor\nbeasts. Wait a minute and I will come.\"\n\nThen he rose, found the Khan's sword, a beautiful and ancient weapon,\nand with a single cut of its keen edge, killed the second dog that I\nhad wounded, which was still yowling and snarling at us. After this he\ncollected the two spears and my knife, saying that they might be useful,\nand without trouble caught the Khan's horse, which stood with hanging\nhead close by, so tired that even this desperate fight had not\nfrightened it away.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, \"up you go, old fellow. You are not fit to walk any\nfarther;\" and with his help I climbed into the saddle.\n\nThen slipping the rein over his arm he led the horse, which walked\nstiffly, on to the river, that ran within a quarter of a mile of\nus, though to me, tortured as I was by pain and half delirious with\nexhaustion, the journey seemed long enough.\n\nStill we came there somehow, and, forgetting my wounds, I tumbled from\nthe horse, threw myself flat and drank and drank, more, I think,\nthan ever I did before. Not in all my life have I tasted anything so\ndelicious as was that long draught of water. When I had satisfied my\nthirst, I dipped my head and made shift to jerk my wounded arm into it,\nfor its coolness seemed to still the pain. Presently Leo rose, the water\nrunning from his face and beard, and said--\"What shall we do now? The\nriver seems to be wide, over a hundred yards, and it is low, but there\nmay be deep water in the middle. Shall we try to cross, in which case we\nmight drown, or stop where we are till daylight and take our chance of\nthe death-hounds?\"\n\n\"I can't go another foot,\" I murmured faintly, \"much less try to ford an\nunknown river.\"\n\nNow, about thirty yards from the shore was an island covered with reeds\nand grasses.\n\n\"Perhaps we could reach that,\" he said. \"Come, get on to my back, and we\nwill try.\"\n\nI obeyed with difficulty, and we set out, he feeling his way with the\nhandle of the spear. The water proved to be quite shallow; indeed, it\nnever came much above his knees, so that we reached the island without\ntrouble. Here Leo laid me down on the soft rushes, and, returning to the\nmainland, brought over the black horse and the remaining weapons, and\nhaving unsaddled the beast, knee-haltered and turned it loose, whereon\nit immediately lay down, for it was too spent to feed.\n\nThen he set to work to doctor my wounds. Well it proved for me that the\nsleeve of my garment was so thick, for even through it the flesh of my\nforearm was torn to ribbons, moreover a bone seemed to be broken. Leo\ncollected a double handful of some soft wet moss and, having washed the\narm, wrapped it round with a handkerchief, over which he laid the moss.\nThen with a second handkerchief and some strips of linen torn from our\nundergarments he fastened a couple of split reeds to serve as rough\nsplints to the wounded limb. While he was doing this I suppose that I\nslept or swooned. At any rate, I remember no more.\n\nSometime during that night Leo had a strange dream, of which he told me\nthe next morning. I suppose that it must have been a dream as certainly\nI saw or was aware of nothing. Well, he dreamed--I use his own words as\nnearly as possible--that again he heard those accursed death-hounds in\nfull cry. Nearer and nearer they came, following our spoor to the edge\nof the river--all the pack that had run down the horses. At the water's\nbrink they halted and were mute. Then suddenly a puff of wind brought\nthe scent of us upon the island to one of them which lifted up its head\nand uttered a single bay. The rest clustered about it, and all at once\nthey made a dash at the water.\n\nLeo could see and hear everything. He felt that after all our doom was\nnow at hand, and yet, held in the grip of nightmare, if nightmare it\nwere, he was quite unable to stir or even to cry out to wake and warn\nme.\n\nNow followed the marvel of this vision. Giving tongue as they came, half\nswimming and half plunging, the hounds drew near to the island where we\nslept. Then, suddenly Leo saw that we were no longer alone. In front of\nus, on the brink of the water, stood the figure of a woman clad in some\ndark garment. He could not describe her face or appearance, for her back\nwas towards him.\n\nAll he knew was that she stood there, like a guard, holding some object\nin her raised hand, and that suddenly the advancing hounds caught sight\nof her. In an instant it was as though they were paralysed by fear--for\ntheir bays turned to fearful howlings. One or two of those that were\nnearest to the island seemed to lose their footing and be swept away by\nthe stream. The rest struggled back to the bank, and fled wildly like\nwhipped curs.\n\nThen the dark, commanding figure, which in his dream Leo took to be the\nguardian Spirit of the Mountain, vanished. That it left no footprints\nbehind it I can vouch, for in the morning we looked to see.\n\nWhen, awakened by the sharp pangs in my arm, I opened my eyes again, the\ndawn was breaking. A thin mist hung over the river and the island, and\nthrough it I could see Leo sleeping heavily at my side and the shape of\nthe black horse, which had risen and was grazing close at hand. I lay\nstill for a while remembering all that we had undergone and wondering\nthat I should live to wake, till presently above the murmuring of the\nwater I heard a sound which terrified me, the sound of voices. I sat up\nand peered through the reeds, and there upon the bank, looking enormous\nin the mist, I saw two figures mounted upon horses, those of a woman and\na man.\n\nThey were pointing to the ground as though they examined spoor in the\nsand. I heard the man say something about the dogs not daring to enter\nthe territory of the Mountain, a remark which came back to my mind again\nafter Leo had told me his dream. Then I remembered how we were placed.\n\n\"Wake!\" I whispered to Leo. \"Wake, we are pursued.\"\n\nHe sprang to his feet, rubbing his eyes and snatching at a spear. Now\nthose upon the bank saw him, and a sweet voice spoke through the mist,\nsaying--\"Lay down that weapon, my guest, for we are not come to harm\nyou.\"\n\nIt was the voice of the Khania Atene, and the man with her was the old\nShaman Simbri.\n\n\"What shall we do now, Horace?\" asked Leo with something like a groan,\nfor in the whole world there were no two people whom he less wished to\nsee.\n\n\"Nothing,\" I answered, \"it is for them to play.\"\n\n\"Come to us,\" called the Khania across the water. \"I swear that we mean\nno harm. Are we not alone?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" answered Leo, \"but it seems unlikely. Where we are we\nstop until we are ready to march again.\"\n\nAtene spoke to Simbri. What she said we could not hear, for she\nwhispered, but she appeared to be arguing with him and persuading him to\nsome course of which he strongly disapproved. Then suddenly both of\nthem put their horses at the water and rode to us through the shallows.\nReaching the island, they dismounted, and we stood staring at each\nother. The old man seemed very weary in body and oppressed in mind, but\nthe Khania was strong and beautiful as ever, nor had passion and fatigue\nleft any trace upon her inscrutable face. It was she who broke the\nsilence, saying--\"You have ridden fast and far since last we met, my\nguests, and left an evil token to mark the path you took. Yonder among\nthe rocks one lies dead. Say, how came he to his end, who has no wound\nupon him?\"\n\n\"By these,\" answered Leo, stretching out his hands.\n\n\"I knew it,\" she answered, \"and I blame you not, for fate decreed that\ndeath for him, and now it is fulfilled. Still, there are those to whom\nyou must answer for his blood, and I only can protect you from them.\"\n\n\"Or betray me to them,\" said Leo. \"Khania, what do you seek?\"\n\n\"That answer which you should have given me this twelve hours gone.\nRemember, before you speak, that I alone can save your life--aye, and\nwill do it and clothe you with that dead madman's crown and mantle.\"\n\n\"You shall have your answer on yonder Mountain,\" said Leo, pointing to\nthe peak above us, \"where I seek mine.\"\n\nShe paled a little and replied, \"To find that it is death, for, as I\nhave told you, the place is guarded by savage folk who know no pity.\"\n\n\"So be it. Then Death is the answer that we seek. Come, Horace, let us\ngo to meet him.\"\n\n\"I swear to you,\" she broke in, \"that there dwells not the woman of your\ndreams. I am that woman, yes, even I, as you are the man of mine.\"\n\n\"Then, lady, prove it yonder upon the Mountain,\" Leo answered.\n\n\"There dwells there no woman,\" Atene went on hurriedly, \"nothing dwells\nthere. It is the home of fire and--a Voice.\"\n\n\"What voice?\"\n\n\"The Voice of the Oracle that speaks from the fire. The Voice of a\nSpirit whom no man has ever seen, or shall see.\"\n\n\"Come, Horace,\" said Leo, and he moved towards the horse.\n\n\"Men,\" broke in the old Shaman, \"would you rush upon your doom? Listen;\nI have visited yonder haunted place, for it was I who according to\ncustom brought thither the body of the Khan Atene's father for burial,\nand I warn you to set no foot within its temples.\"\n\n\"Which your mistress said that we should never reach,\" I commented, but\nLeo only answered--\"We thank you for your warning,\" and added, \"Horace,\nwatch them while I saddle the horse, lest they do us a mischief.\"\n\nSo I took the spear in my uninjured hand and stood ready. But they made\nno attempt to hurt us, only fell back a little and began to talk in\nhurried whispers. It was evident to me that they were much perturbed.\nIn a few minutes the horse was saddled and Leo assisted me to mount it.\nThen he said--\"We go to accomplish our fate, whatever it may be, but\nbefore we part, Khania, I thank you for the kindness you have shown us,\nand pray you to be wise and forget that we have ever been. Through no\nwill of mine your husband's blood is on my hands, and that alone must\nseparate us for ever. We are divided by the doors of death and destiny.\nGo back to your people, and pardon me if most unwillingly I have brought\nyou doubt and trouble. Farewell.\"\n\nShe listened with bowed head, then replied, very sadly--\"I thank you for\nyour gentle words, but, Leo Vincey, we do not part thus easily. You have\nsummoned me to the Mountain, and even to the Mountain I shall follow\nyou. Aye, and there I will meet its Spirit, as I have always known I\nmust and as the Shaman here has always known I must. Yes, I will match\nmy strength and magic against hers, as it is decreed that I shall do. To\nthe victor be that crown for which we have warred for ages.\"\n\nThen suddenly Atene sprang to her saddle, and turning her horse's head\nrode it back through the water to the shore, followed by old Simbri, who\nlifted up his crooked hands as though in woe and fear, muttering as he\nwent--\"You have entered the forbidden river and now, Atene, the day of\ndecision is upon us all--upon us and her--that predestined day of ruin\nand of war.\"\n\n\"What do they mean?\" asked Leo of me.\n\n\"I don't know,\" I answered; \"but I have no doubt we shall find out soon\nenough and that it will be something unpleasant. Now for this river.\"\n\nBefore we had struggled through it I thought more than once that the day\nof drowning was upon us also, for in places there were deep rapids which\nnearly swept us away. But Leo, who waded, leading the Khan's horse by\nthe bridle, felt his path and supported himself with the spear shaft, so\nthat in the end we reached the other bank safely.\n\nBeyond it lay a breadth of marshy lands, that doubtless were overflowed\nwhen the torrent was in flood. Through these we pushed our way as fast\nas we could, for we feared lest the Khania had gone to fetch her escort,\nwhich we thought she might have left behind the rise, and would return\nwith it presently to hunt us down. At that time we did not know what\nwe learned afterwards, that with its bordering river the soil of the\nMountain was absolutely sacred and, in practice, inviolable. True, it\nhad been invaded by the people of Kaloon in several wars, but on each\noccasion their army was destroyed or met with terrible disaster. Little\nwonder then they had come to believe that the House of Fire was under\nthe protection of some unconquerable Spirit.\n\nLeaving the marsh, we reached a bare, rising plain, which led to the\nfirst slope of the Mountain three or four miles away. Here we expected\nevery moment to be attacked by the savages of whom we had heard so much,\nbut no living creature did we see. The place was a desert streaked with\nveins of rock that once had been molten lava. _I_ do not remember much\nelse about it; indeed, the pain in my arm was so sharp that I had no\neyes for physical features. At length the rise ended in a bare, broad\ndonga, quite destitute of vegetation, of which the bottom was buried in\nlava and a debris of rocks washed down by the rain or melting snows from\nslopes above. This donga was bordered on the farther side by a cliff,\nperhaps fifty feet in height, in which we could see no opening.\n\nStill we descended the place, that was dark and rugged; pervaded,\nmoreover, by an extraordinary gloom, and as we went perceived that its\nlava floor was sprinkled over with a multitude of white objects. Soon we\ncame to the first of these and found that it was the skeleton of a\nhuman being. Here was a veritable Valley of Dead Bones, thousands upon\nthousands of them; a gigantic graveyard. It seemed as though some great\narmy had perished here.\n\nIndeed, we found afterwards that this was the case, for on one of those\noccasions in the far past when the people of Kaloon had attacked the\nMountain tribes, they were trapped and slaughtered in this gully,\nleaving their bones as a warning and a token. Among these sad skeletons\nwe wandered disconsolately, seeking a path up the opposing cliff, and\nfinding none, until at length we came to a halt, not knowing which way\nto turn. Then it was that we met with our first strange experience on\nthe Mountain.\n\nThe gulf and its mouldering relics depressed us, so that for awhile\nwe were silent, and, to tell the truth, somewhat afraid. Yes, even\nthe horse seemed afraid, for it snorted a little, hung its head and\nshivered. Close by us lay a pile of bones, the remains evidently of a\nnumber of wretched creatures that, dead or living, had been hurled down\nfrom the cliff above, and on the top of the pile was a little huddled\nheap, which we took for more bones.\n\n\"Unless we can find a way out of this accursed charnel-house before\nlong, I think that we shall add to its company,\" I said, staring round\nme.\n\nAs the words left my lips it seemed to me that from the corner of my eye\nI saw the heap on the top of the bones stir. I looked round. Yes, it\nwas stirring. It rose, it stood up, a human figure, apparently that of\na woman--but of this I could not be sure--wrapped from head to foot in\nwhite and wearing a hanging veil over its face, or rather a mask with\ncut eye-holes. It advanced towards us while we stared at it, till the\nhorse, catching sight of the thing, shied violently and nearly threw me.\nWhen at a distance of about ten paces it paused and beckoned with its\nhand, that was also swathed in white like the arm of a mummy.\n\n\"What the devil are you?\" shouted Leo, and his voice echoed drearily\namong those naked rocks. But the creature did not answer, it only\ncontinued to beckon.\n\nLeo walked up to it to assure himself that we were not the victims of\nsome hallucination. As he came it glided back to its heap of bones and\nstood there like a ghost of one dead arisen from amidst these grinning\nevidences of death, or rather a swathed corpse, for that is what it\nresembled. Leo followed with the intention of touching it to assure\nhimself of its reality, whereon it lifted its white-wrapped arm and\nstruck him lightly on the breast. Then as he recoiled it pointed with\nits hand, first upwards as though to the Peak or the sky, and next at\nthe wall of rock which faced us.\n\nHe returned to me saying, \"What shall we do?\"\n\n\"Follow, I suppose. It may be a messenger from above,\" and I nodded\ntoward the mountain crest.\n\n\"From below, more likely,\" Leo muttered, \"for I don't like the look of\nthis guide.\"\n\nStill he motioned with his hand to the creature to proceed. Apparently\nit understood, for it turned to the left and began to pick its way\namongst the stones and skeletons swiftly and without noise. We followed\nfor several hundred yards till it reached a shallow cleft in the rock.\nThis cleft we had seen already, but as it appeared to end at a depth of\nabout thirty feet, we passed on. The figure entered here and vanished.\n\n\"It must be a shadow,\" said Leo doubtfully.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" I answered, \"shadows don't strike one. Go on.\"\n\nSo he led the horse up the cleft, to find that at the end it turned\nsharply to the right and that the form was standing there awaiting us.\nForward it went again and we after it down a little gorge that grew ever\ngloomier till it terminated in what might have been a cave, or a gallery\ncut in the rock.\n\nHere our guide came back to us apparently with the intention of taking\nthe horse by the bridle, but at this nearer sight of it the brute\nsnorted and reared up, so that it almost fell backwards upon me. As\nit found its feet again the figure struck it on the head in the same\npassionless, inhuman way that it had struck Leo, whereon the horse\ntrembled and burst into a sweat as though with fear, making no further\nattempt to escape or to disobey. Then it took one side of the bridle\nin its swathed hand and, Leo clinging to the other, we plunged into the\ntunnel.\n\nOur position was not pleasant, for we knew not whither we were being led\nby this horrible conductor, and suspected that it might be to meet our\ndeaths in the darkness. Moreover, I guessed that the path was narrow and\nbordered by some gulf, for as we went I heard stones fall, apparently to\na considerable depth, while the poor horse lifted its feet gingerly and\nsnorted in abject fear. At length we saw daylight, and never was I more\nglad of its advent, although it showed us that there _was_ a gulf on our\nright, and that the path we travelled could not measure more than ten\nfeet in width.\n\nNow we were out of the tunnel, that evidently had saved us a wide\ndetour, and standing for the first time upon the actual slope of the\nMountain, which stretched upwards for a great number of miles till it\nreached the snow-line above. Here also we saw evidences of human life,\nfor the ground was cultivated in patches and herds of mountain sheep and\ncattle were visible in the distance.\n\nPresently we entered a gully, following a rough path that led along the\nedge of a raging torrent. It was a desolate place, half a mile wide\nor more, having hundreds of fantastic lava boulders strewn about its\nslopes. Before we had gone a mile I heard a shrill whistle, and suddenly\nfrom behind these boulders sprang a number of men, quite fifty of them.\nAll we could note at the time was that they were brawny, savage-looking\nfellows, for the most part red haired and bearded, although their\ncomplexions were rather dark, who wore cloaks of white goat skins and\ncarried spears and shields. I should imagine that they were not unlike\nthe ancient Picts and Scots as they appeared to the invading Romans. At\nus they came uttering their shrill, whistling cries, evidently with the\nintention of spearing us on the spot.\n\n\"Now for it,\" said Leo, drawing his sword, for escape was impossible;\nthey were all round us. \"Good-bye, Horace.\"\n\n\"Good-bye,\" I answered rather faintly, understanding what the Khania and\nthe old Shaman had meant when they said that we should be killed before\nwe ascended the first slope of the Mountain.\n\nMeanwhile our ghastly-looking guide had slipped behind a great boulder,\nand even then it occurred to me that her part in the tragedy being\nplayed, she, if it were a woman at all, was withdrawing herself while\nwe met our miserable fate. But here I did her injustice, for she had, I\nsuppose, come to save us from this very fate which without her presence\nwe must most certainly have suffered. When the savages were within a few\nyards suddenly she appeared on the top of the boulder, looking like a\nsecond Witch of Endor, and stretched out her arm. Not a word did she\nspeak, only stretched out her draped arm, but the effect was remarkable\nand instantaneous.\n\nAt the sight of her down on to their faces went those wild men, every\none of them, as though a lightning stroke had in an instant swept them\nout of existence. Then she let her arm fall and beckoned, whereon a\ngreat fellow who, I suppose, was the leader of the band, rose and crept\ntowards her with bowed head, submissive as a beaten dog. To him she\nmade signs, pointing to us, pointing to the far-off Peak, crossing and\nuncrossing her white-wrapped arms, but so far as I could hear, speaking\nno word. It was evident that the chief understood her, however, for\nhe said something in a guttural language. Then he uttered his shrill\nwhistle, whereon the band rose and departed thence at full speed,\nthis way and the other, so that in another minute they had vanished as\nquickly as they came.\n\nNow our guide motioned to us to proceed, and led the way upward as\ncalmly as though nothing had happened.\n\nFor over _two_ hours we went on thus till our path brought us from the\nravine on to a grassy declivity, across which it wound its way. Here, to\nour astonishment, we found a fire burning, and hanging above the fire\nan earthenware pot, which was on the boil, although we could see no man\ntending it. The figure signalled to me to dismount, pointing to the pot\nin token that we were to eat the food which doubtless she had ordered\nthe wild men to prepare for us, and very glad was _I_ to obey her.\nProvision had been made for the horse also, for near the fire lay a\ngreat bundle of green forage.\n\nWhile Leo off-saddled the beast and spread the provender for it, taking\nwith me a spare earthen vessel that lay ready, I went to the edge of the\ntorrent to drink and steep my wounded arm in its ice-cold stream. This\nrelieved it greatly, though by now I was sure from various symptoms\nthat the brute Master's fangs had fortunately only broken or injured the\nsmall bone, a discovery for which I was thankful enough. Having finished\nattending to it as well as I was able, I filled the jar with water.\n\nOn my way back a thought struck me, and going to where our mysterious\nguide stood still as Lot's wife after she had been turned into a pillar\nof salt, I offered it to her, hoping that she would unveil her face and\ndrink. Then for the first time she showed some sign of being human,\nor so I thought, for it seemed to me that she bowed ever so little\nin acknowledgment of the courtesy. If so--and I may have been\nmistaken--this was all, for the next instant she turned her back on me\nto show that it was declined. So she would not, or for aught I\nknew, could not drink. Neither would she eat, for when Leo tried her\nafterwards with food she refused it in like fashion.\n\nMeanwhile he had taken the pot off the fire, and as soon as its contents\ngrew cool enough we fell on them eagerly, for we were starving. After\nwe had eaten and drunk, Leo re-dressed my arm as best he could and we\nrested awhile. Indeed, I think that, being very tired, we began to doze,\nfor I was awakened by a shadow falling on us and looked up to see our\ncorpse-like guide standing close by and pointing first to the sun, then\nat the horse, as though to show us that we had far to travel. So we\nsaddled up and went on again somewhat refreshed, for at least we were no\nlonger ravenous.\n\nAll the rest of that day we journeyed on up the grassy slopes, seeing no\nman, although occasionally we heard the wild whistle which told us that\nwe were being watched by the Mountain savages. By sundown the character\nof the country had changed, for the grass was replaced with rocks,\namongst which grew stunted firs. We had left the lower slopes and were\nbeginning to climb the Mountain itself.\n\nThe sun sank and we went on through the twilight. The twilight died\nand we went on through the dark, our path lit only by the stars and the\nfaint radiance of the glowing pillar of smoke above the Peak, which\nwas reflected on to us from the mighty mantle of its snows. Forward we\ntoiled, whilst a few paces ahead of us walked our unwearying guide. If\nshe had seemed weird and inhuman before, now she appeared a very ghost,\nas, clad in her graveyard white, upon which the faint light shimmered,\nnever speaking, never looking back, she glided on noiselessly between\nthe black rocks and the twisted, dark-green firs and junipers.\n\nSoon we lost all count of the road. We turned this way and turned that\nway, we passed an open patch and through the shadows of a grove, till at\nlength as the moon rose we entered a ravine, and following a path\nthat ran down it, came to a place which is best described as a large\namphitheatre cut by the hand of nature out of the rock of the Mountain.\nEvidently it was chosen as a place of defence, for its entrance was\nnarrow and tortuous, built up at the end also, so that only one person\ncould pass its gateway at a time. Within an open space and at its\nfarther side stood low, stone houses built against the rock. In front\nof these houses, the moonlight shining full upon them, were gathered\nseveral hundred men and women arranged in a semicircle and in alternate\ncompanies, who appeared to be engaged in the celebration of some rite.\n\nIt was wild enough. In front of them, and in the exact centre of the\nsemi-circle, stood a gigantic, red-bearded man, who was naked except\nfor a skin girdle about his loins. He was swinging himself backwards\nand forwards, his hands resting upon his hips, and as he swung, shouting\nsomething like \"_Ho, haha, ho!_\" When he bent towards the audience it\nbent towards him, and every time he straightened himself it echoed his\nfinal shout of \"_Ho!_\" in a volume of sound that made the precipices\nring. Nor was this all, for perched upon his hairy head, with arched\nback and waving tail, stood a great white cat.\n\nAnything stranger, and indeed more fantastic than the general effect of\nthis scene, lit by the bright moonlight and set in that wild arena, it\nwas never my lot to witness. The red-haired, half-naked men and women,\nthe gigantic priest, the mystical white cat, that, gripping his\nscalp with its claws, waved its tail and seemed to take a part in the\nperformance; the unholy chant and its volleying chorus, all helped to\nmake it extraordinarily impressive. This struck us the more, perhaps,\nbecause at the time we could not in the least guess its significance,\nthough we imagined that it must be preliminary to some sacrifice or\noffering. It was like the fragment of a nightmare preserved by the\nawakened senses in all its mad, meaningless reality.\n\nNow round the open space where these savages were celebrating their\nworship, or whatever it might be, ran a rough stone wall about six feet\nin height, in which wall was a gateway. Towards this we advanced quite\nunseen, for upon our side of the wall grew many stunted pines. Through\nthese pines our guide led us, till in the thickest of them, some\nfew yards from the open gateway and a little to the right of it, she\nmotioned to us to stop.\n\nThen she went to a low place in the wall and stood there as though she\nwere considering the scene beyond. It seemed to us, indeed, that she\nsaw what she had not expected and was thereby perplexed or angered.\nPresently she appeared to make up her mind, for again she motioned to\nus to remain where we were, enjoining silence upon us by placing her\nswathed hand upon the mask that hid her face. Next moment she was gone.\nHow she went, or whither, I cannot say; all we knew was that she was no\nlonger there.\n\n\"What shall we do now?\" whispered Leo to me.\n\n\"Stay where we are till she comes back again or something happens,\" I\nanswered.\n\nSo there being nothing else to be done, we stayed, hoping that the\nhorse would not betray us by neighing, or that we might not be otherwise\ndiscovered, since we were certain that if so we should be in danger of\ndeath. Very soon, however, we forgot the anxieties of our own position\nin the study of the wild scene before us, which now began to develop a\nfearful interest.\n\nIt would seem that what has been described was but preliminary to the\ndrama itself, and that this drama was the trial of certain people for\ntheir lives. This we could guess, for after awhile the incantation\nceased and the crowd in front of the big man with the cat upon his head\nopened out, while behind him a column of smoke rose into the air, as\nthough light had been set to some sunk furnace.\n\nInto the space that had thus been cleared were now led seven persons,\nwhose hands were tied behind them. They were of both sexes and included\nan old man and a woman with a tall and handsome figure, who appeared\nto be quite young, scarcely more than a girl indeed. These seven were\nranged in a line where they stood, clearly in great fear, for the old\nman fell upon his knees and one of the women began to sob. Thus they\nwere left awhile, perhaps to allow the fire behind them to burn up,\nwhich it soon did with great fierceness, throwing a vivid light upon\nevery detail of the spectacle.\n\nNow all was ready, and a man brought a wooden tray to the red-bearded\npriest, who was seated on a stool, the white cat upon his knees, whither\nwe had seen it leap from his head a little while before. He took the\ntray by its handles and at a word from him the cat jumped on to it and\nsat there. Then amidst the most intense silence he rose and uttered some\nprayer, apparently to the cat, which sat facing him. This done he turned\nthe tray round so that the creature's back was now towards him, and,\nadvancing to the line of prisoners, began to walk up and down in front\nof them, which he did several times, at each turn drawing a little\nnearer.\n\nHolding out the tray, he presented it at the face of the prisoner on the\nleft, whereon the cat rose, arched its back and began to lift its paws\nup and down. Presently he moved to the next prisoner and held it before\nhim awhile, and so on till he came to the fifth, that young woman of\nwhom I have spoken. Now the cat grew very angry, for in the death-like\nstillness we could hear it spitting and growling. At length it seemed\nto lift its paws and strike the girl upon the face, whereon she screamed\naloud, a terrible scream. Then all the audience broke out into a shout,\na single word, which we understood, for we had heard one very like it\nused by the people of the Plain. It was \"Witch! Witch! _Witch!_\"\n\nExecutioners who were waiting for the victim to be chosen in this ordeal\nby cat, rushed forward and seizing the girl began to drag her towards\nthe fire. The prisoner who was standing by her and whom we rightly\nguessed to be her husband, tried to protect her, but his arms being\nbound, poor fellow, he could do nothing. One of the executioners knocked\nhim down with a stick. For a moment his wife escaped and threw herself\nupon him, but the brutes lifted her up again, haling her towards the\nfire, whilst all the audience shouted wildly.\n\n\"I can't stand this,\" said Leo, \"it's murder--coldblooded murder,\" and\nhe drew his sword.\n\n\"Best leave the beasts alone,\" I answered doubtfully, though my own\nblood was boiling in my veins.\n\nWhether he heard or not I do not know, for the next thing I saw was Leo\nrushing through the gate waving the Khan's sword and shouting at the\ntop of his voice. Then I struck my heels into the ribs of the horse and\nfollowed after him. In ten seconds we were among them. As we came the\nsavages fell back this way and that, staring at us amazed, for at first\nI think they took us for apparitions. Thus Leo on foot and I galloping\nafter him, we came to the place.\n\nThe executioners and their victim were near the fire now--a very great\nfire of resinous pine logs built in a pit that measured about eight feet\nacross. Close to it sat the priest upon his stool, watching the scene\nwith a cruel smile, and rewarding the cat with little gobbets of raw\nmeat, that he took from a leathern pouch at his side, occupations in\nwhich he was so deeply engaged that he never saw us until we were right\non to him.\n\nShouting, \"Leave her alone, you blackguards,\" Leo rushed at the\nexecutioners, and with a single blow of his sword severed the arm of one\nof them who gripped the woman by the nape of the neck.\n\nWith a yell of pain and rage the man sprang back and stood waving the\nstump towards the people and staring at it wildly. In the confusion that\nfollowed I saw the victim slip from the hands of her astonished would-be\nmurderers and run into the darkness, where she vanished. Also I saw\nthe witch-doctor spring up, still holding the tray on which the cat was\nsitting, and heard him begin to shout a perfect torrent of furious abuse\nat Leo, who in reply waved his sword and cursed him roundly in English\nand many other languages.\n\nThen of a sudden the cat upon the tray, infuriated, I suppose, by the\nnoise and the interruption of its meal, sprang straight at Leo's face.\nHe appeared to catch it in mid-air with his left hand and with all his\nstrength dashed it to the ground, where it lay writhing and screeching.\nThen, as though by an afterthought, he stooped, picked the devilish\ncreature up again and hurled it into the heart of the fire, for he was\nmad with rage and knew not what he did.\n\nAt the sight of that awful sacrilege--for such it was to them who\nworshipped this beast--a gasp of horror rose from the spectators,\nfollowed by a howl of execration. Then like a wave of the sea they\nrushed at us. I saw Leo cut one man down, and next instant I was off the\nhorse and being dragged towards the furnace. At the edge of it I met Leo\nin like plight, but fighting furiously, for his strength was great and\nthey were half afraid of him.\n\n\"Why couldn't you leave the cat alone?\" I shouted at him in idiotic\nremonstrance, for my brain had gone, and all I knew was that we were\nabout to be thrown into the fiery pit. Already I was over it; I felt\nthe flames singe my hair and saw its red caverns awaiting me, when of a\nsudden the brutal hands that held me were unloosed and I fell backwards\nto the ground, where I lay staring upwards.\n\nThis was what I saw. Standing in front of the fire, her draped form\nquivering as though with rage, was our ghostly-looking guide, who\npointed with her hand at the gigantic, red-headed witch-doctor. But she\nwas no longer alone, for with her were a score or more of men clad in\nwhite robes and armed with swords; black-eyed, ascetic-looking men, with\nclean-shaved heads and faces, for their scalps shone in the firelight.\n\nAt the sight of them terror had seized that multitude which, mad as\ngoaded bulls but a few seconds before, now fled in every direction like\nsheep frightened by a wolf. The leader of the white-robed priests, a man\nwith a gentle face, which when at rest was clothed in a perpetual smile,\nwas addressing the medicine-man, and I understood something of his talk.\n\n\"Dog,\" he said in effect, speaking in a smooth, measured voice that yet\nwas terrible, \"accursed dog, beast-worshipper, what were you about to do\nto the guests of the mighty Mother of the Mountain? Is it for this that\nyou and your idolatries have been spared so long? Answer, if you have\nanything to say. Answer quickly, for your time is short.\"\n\nWith a groan of fear the great fellow flung himself upon his knees, not\nto the head-priest who questioned him, but before the quivering shape of\nour guide, and to her put up half-articulate prayers for mercy.\n\n\"Cease,\" said the high-priest, \"she is the Minister who judges and the\nSword that strikes. I am the Ears and the Voice. Speak and tell\nme--were you about to cast those men, whom you were commanded to receive\nhospitably, into yonder fire because they saved the victim of your\ndevilries and killed the imp you cherished? Nay, I saw it all. Know that\nit was but a trap set to catch you, who have been allowed to live too\nlong.\"\n\nBut still the wretch writhed before the draped form and howled for\nmercy.\n\n\"Messenger,\" said the high-priest, \"with thee the power goes. Declare\nthy decree.\"\n\nThen our guide lifted her hand slowly and pointed to the fire. At once\nthe man turned ghastly white, groaned and fell back, as I think, quite\ndead, slain by his own terror.\n\nNow many of the people had fled, but some remained, and to these\nthe priest called in cold tones, bidding them approach. They obeyed,\ncreeping towards him.\n\n\"Look,\" he said, pointing to the man, \"look and tremble at the justice\nof Hes the Mother. Aye, and be sure that as it is with him, so shall it\nbe with every one of you who dares to defy her and to practise sorcery\nand murder. Lift up that dead dog who was your chief.\"\n\nSome of them crept forward and did his bidding.\n\n\"Now, cast him into the bed which he had made ready for his victims.\"\n\nStaggering forward to the edge of the flaming pit, they obeyed, and the\ngreat body fell with a crash amongst the burning boughs and vanished\nthere.\n\n\"Listen, you people,\" said the priest, \"and learn that this man deserved\nhis dreadful doom. Know you why he purposed to kill that woman whom the\nstrangers saved? Because his familiar marked her as a witch, you think.\nI tell you it was not so. It was because she being fair, he would\nhave taken her from her husband, as he had taken many another, and she\nrefused him. But the Eye saw, the Voice spoke, and the Messenger did\njudgment. He is caught in his own snare, and so shall you be, every one\nof you who dares to think evil in his heart or to do it with his hands.\n\n\"Such is the just decree of the Hesea, spoken by her from her throne\namidst the fires of the Mountain.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nBENEATH THE SHADOWING WINGS\n\nOne by one the terrified tribesmen crept away. When the last of them\nwere gone the priest advanced to Leo and saluted him by placing his hand\nupon his forehead.\n\n\"Lord,\" he said, in the same corrupt Grecian dialect which was used by\nthe courtiers of Kaloon, \"I will not ask if you are hurt, since from the\nmoment that you entered the sacred river and set foot within this land\nyou and your companion were protected by a power invisible and could not\nbe harmed by man or spirit, however great may have seemed your danger.\nYet vile hands have been laid upon you, and this is the command of the\nMother whom I serve, that, if you desire it, every one of those men who\ntouched you shall die before your eyes. Say, is that your will?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" answered Leo; \"they were mad and blind, let no blood be shed for\n_us_. All we ask of you, friend--but, how are you called?\"\n\n\"Name me Oros,\" he answered.\n\n\"Friend Oros--a good title for one who dwells upon the Mountain--all we\nask is food and shelter, and to be led swiftly into the presence of her\nwhom you name Mother, that Oracle whose wisdom we have travelled far to\nseek.\"\n\nHe bowed and answered: \"The food and shelter are prepared and to-morrow,\nwhen you have rested, I am commanded to conduct you whither you desire\nto be. Follow me, I pray you\"; and he preceded us past the fiery pit to\na building that stood about fifty yards away against the rock wall of\nthe amphitheatre.\n\nIt would seem that it was a guest-house, or at least had been made ready\nto serve that purpose, as in it lamps were lit and a fire burned, for\nhere the air was cold. The house was divided into two rooms, the second\nof them a sleeping place, to which he led us through the first.\n\n\"Enter,\" he said, \"for you will need to cleanse yourselves, and\nyou\"--here he addressed himself to me--\"to be treated for that hurt to\nyour arm which you had from the jaws of the great hound.\"\n\n\"How know you that?\" I asked.\n\n\"It matters not if I do know and have made ready,\" Oros answered\ngravely.\n\nThis second room was lighted and warmed like the first, moreover, heated\nwater stood in basins of metal and on the beds were laid clean linen\ngarments and dark-coloured hooded robes, lined with rich fur. Also upon\na little table were ointments, bandages, and splints, a marvellous thing\nto see, for it told me that the very nature of my hurt had been divined.\nBut I asked no more questions; I was too weary; moreover, I knew that it\nwould be useless.\n\nNow the priest Oros helped me to remove my tattered robe, and, undoing\nthe rough bandages upon my arm, washed it gently with warm water, in\nwhich he mixed some spirit, and examined it with the skill of a trained\ndoctor.\n\n\"The fangs rent deep,\" he said, \"and the small bone is broken, but you\nwill take no harm, save for the scars which must remain.\" Then, having\ntreated the wounds with ointment, he wrapped the limb with such a\ndelicate touch that it scarcely pained me, saying that by the morrow\nthe swelling would have gone down and he would set the bone. This indeed\nhappened.\n\nAfter it was done he helped me to wash and to clothe myself in the clean\ngarments, and put a sling about my neck to serve as a rest for my arm.\nMeanwhile Leo had also dressed himself, so that we left the chamber\ntogether very different men to the foul, blood-stained wanderers who had\nentered there. In the outer room we found food prepared for us, of which\nwe ate with a thankful heart and without speaking. Then, blind with\nweariness, we returned to the other chamber and, having removed our\nouter garments, flung ourselves upon the beds and were soon plunged in\nsleep.\n\nAt some time in the night I awoke suddenly, at what hour I do not know,\nas certain people wake, I among them, when their room is entered, even\nwithout the slightest noise. Before I opened my eyes I felt that some\none was with us in the place. Nor was I mistaken. A little lamp still\nburned in the chamber, a mere wick floating in oil, and by its light\nI saw a dim, ghost-like form standing near the door. Indeed I thought\nalmost that it was a ghost, till presently I remembered, and knew it for\nour corpse-like guide, who appeared to be looking intently at the bed on\nwhich Leo lay, or so I thought, for the head was bent in that direction.\n\nAt first she was quite still, then she moaned aloud, a low and terrible\nmoan, which seemed to well from the very heart.\n\nSo the thing was not dumb, as I had believed. Evidently it could suffer,\nand express its suffering in a human fashion. Look! it was wringing its\npadded hands as in an excess of woe. Now it would seem that Leo began to\nfeel its influence also, for he stirred and spoke in his sleep, so low\nat first that I could only distinguish the tongue he used, which was\nArabic. Presently I caught a few words.\n\n\"Ayesha,\" he said, \"_Ayesha!_\"\n\nThe figure glided towards him and stopped. He sat up in the bed still\nfast asleep, for his eyes were shut. He stretched out his arms, as\nthough seeking one whom he would embrace, and spoke again in a low and\npassionate voice--\"Ayesha, through life and death I have sought thee\nlong. Come to me, my goddess, my desired.\"\n\nThe figure glided yet nearer, and I could see that it was trembling, and\nnow its arms were extended also.\n\nAt the bedside she halted, and Leo laid himself down again. Now the\ncoverings had fallen back, exposing his breast, where lay the leather\nsatchel he always wore, that which contained the lock of Ayesha's hair.\nHe was fast asleep, and the figure seemed to fix its eyes upon this\nsatchel. Presently it did more, for, with surprising deftness those\nwhite-wrapped fingers opened its clasp, yes, and drew out the long\ntress of shining hair. Long and earnestly she gazed at it, then gently\nreplaced the relic, closed the satchel and for a little while seemed to\nweep. While she stood thus the dreaming Leo once more stretched out his\narms and spoke, saying, in the same passion-laden voice--\"Come to me, my\ndarling, my beautiful, my beautiful!\"\n\nAt those words, with a little muffled scream, like that of a scared\nnight-bird, the figure turned and flitted through the doorway.\n\nWhen I was quite certain that she had gone, I gasped aloud.\n\nWhat might this mean, I wondered, in a very agony of bewilderment. This\ncould certainly be no dream: it was real, for I was wide awake. Indeed,\nwhat did it all mean? Who was the ghastly, mummy-like thing which had\nguided us unharmed through such terrible dangers; the Messenger that all\nmen feared, who could strike down a brawny savage with a motion of its\nhand? Why did it creep into the place thus at dead of night, like a\nspirit revisiting one beloved? Why did its presence cause me to awake\nand Leo to dream? Why did it draw out the tress; indeed, how knew it\nthat this tress was hidden there? And why--oh! why, at those tender and\npassionate words did it flit away at last like some scared bat?\n\nThe priest Oros had called our guide Minister, and Sword, that is, one\nwho carries out decrees. But what if they were its own decrees? What if\nthis thing should be she whom we sought, _Ayesha herself?_ Why should I\ntremble at the thought, seeing that if so, our quest was ended, we had\nachieved? Oh! it must be because about this being there was something\nterrible, something un-human and appalling. If Ayesha lived within\nthose mummy-cloths, then it was a different Ayesha whom we had known\nand worshipped. Well could I remember the white-draped form of\n_She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed_, and how, long before she revealed her glorious\nface to us, we guessed the beauty and the majesty hidden beneath that\nveil by which her radiant life and loveliness incarnate could not be\ndisguised.\n\nBut what of this creature? I would not pursue the thought. I was\nmistaken. Doubtless she was what the priest Oros had said--some\nhalf-supernatural being to whom certain powers were given, and,\ndoubtless, she had come to spy on us in our rest that she might make\nreport to the giver of those powers.\n\nComforting myself thus I fell asleep again, for fatigue overcame even\nsuch doubts and fears. In the morning, when they were naturally less\nvivid, I made up my mind that, for various reasons, it would be wisest\nto say nothing of what I had seen to Leo. Nor, indeed, did I do so until\nsome days had gone by.\n\nWhen I awoke the full light was pouring into the chamber, and by it I\nsaw the priest Oros standing at my bedside. I sat up and asked him what\ntime it was, to which he answered with a smile, but in a low voice, that\nit lacked but two hours of mid-day, adding that he had come to set my\narm. Now I saw why he spoke low, for Leo was still fast asleep.\n\n\"Let him rest on,\" he said, as he undid the wrappings on my arm, \"for\nhe has suffered much, and,\" he continued significantly, \"may still have\nmore to suffer.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, friend Oros?\" I asked sharply. \"I thought you told us\nthat we were safe upon this Mountain.\"\n\n\"I told you, friend----\" and he looked at me.\n\n\"Holly is my name----\"\n\n\"--friend Holly, that your bodies are safe. I said nothing of all the\nrest of you. Man is more than flesh and blood. He is mind and spirit as\nwell, and these can be injured also.\"\n\n\"Who is there that would injure them?\" I asked.\n\n\"Friend,\" he answered, gravely, \"you and your companion have come to a\nhaunted land, not as mere wanderers, for then you would be dead ere now,\nbut of set purpose, seeking to lift the veil from mysteries which have\nbeen hid for ages. Well, your aim is known and it may chance that it\nwill be achieved. But if this veil is lifted, it may chance also that\nyou will find what shall send your souls shivering to despair and\nmadness. Say, are you not afraid?\"\n\n\"Somewhat,\" I answered. \"Yet my foster-son and I have seen strange\nthings and lived. We have seen the very Light of Life roll by in\nmajesty; we have been the guests of an Immortal, and watched Death seem\nto conquer her and leave us untouched. Think you then that we will turn\ncowards now? Nay, we march on to fulfil our destinies.\"\n\nAt these words Oros showed neither curiosity nor surprise; it was as\nthough I told him only what he knew.\n\n\"Good,\" he replied, smiling, and with a courteous bow of his shaven\nhead, \"within an hour you shall march on--to fulfil your destinies. If\nI have warned you, forgive me, for I was bidden so to do, perhaps to\ntry your mettle. Is it needful that I should repeat this warning to the\nlord----\" and again he looked at me.\n\n\"Leo Vincey,\" I said.\n\n\"Leo Vincey, yes, Leo Vincey,\" he repeated, as though the name were\nfamiliar to him but had slipped his mind. \"But you have not answered my\nquestion. Is it needful that I should repeat the warning?\"\n\n\"Not in the least; but you can do so if you wish when he awakes.\"\n\n\"Nay, I think with you, that it would be but waste of words,\nfor--forgive the comparison;--what the wolf dares\"--and he looked at\nme--\"the tiger does not flee from,\" and he nodded towards Leo. \"There,\nsee how much better are the wounds upon your arm, which is no longer\nswollen. Now I will bandage it, and within some few weeks the bone will\nbe as sound again as it was before you met the Khan Rassen hunting in\nthe Plains. By the way, you will see him again soon, and his fair wife\nwith him.\"\n\n\"See him again? Do the dead, then, come to life upon this Mountain?\"\n\n\"Nay, but certain of them are brought hither for burial. It is the\nprivilege of the rulers of Kaloon; also, I think, that the Khania has\nquestions to ask of its Oracle.\"\n\n\"Who is its Oracle?\" I asked with eagerness.\n\n\"The Oracle,\" he replied darkly, \"is a Voice. It was ever so, was it\nnot?\"\n\n\"Yes; I have heard that from Atene, but a voice implies a speaker. Is\nthis speaker she whom you name Mother?\"\n\n\"Perhaps, friend Holly.\"\n\n\"And is this Mother a spirit?\"\n\n\"It is a point that has been much debated. They told you so in the\nPlains, did they not? Also the Tribes think it on the Mountain. Indeed,\nthe thing seems reasonable, seeing that all of us who live are flesh and\nspirit. But you will form your own judgment and then we can discuss the\nmatter. There, your arm is finished. Be careful now not to strike it or\nto fall, and look, your companion awakes.\"\n\nSomething over an hour later we started upon our upward journey. I was\nagain mounted on the Khan's horse, which having been groomed and fed\nwas somewhat rested, while to Leo a litter had been offered. This he\ndeclined, however, saying that he had now recovered and would not be\ncarried like a woman. So he walked by the side of my horse, using his\nspear as a staff. We passed the fire-pit--now full of dead, white\nashes, among which were mixed those of the witch-finder and his horrible\ncat--preceded by our dumb guide, at the sight of whom, in her pale\nwrappings, the people of the tribe who had returned to their village\nprostrated themselves, and so remained until she was gone by.\n\nOne of them, however, rose again and, breaking through our escort of\npriests, ran to Leo, knelt before him and kissed his hand. It was that\nyoung woman whose life he had saved, a noble-looking girl, with masses\nof red hair, and by her was her husband, the marks of his bonds still\nshowing on his arms. Our guide seemed to see this incident, though how\nshe did so I do not know. At any rate she turned and made some sign\nwhich the priest interpreted.\n\nCalling the woman to him he asked her sternly how she dared to touch\nthe person of this stranger with her vile lips. She answered that it was\nbecause her heart was grateful. Oros said that for this reason she was\nforgiven; moreover, that in reward for what they had suffered he was\ncommanded to lift up her husband to be the ruler of that tribe during\nthe pleasure of the Mother. He gave notice, moreover, that all should\nobey the new chief in his place, according to their customs, and if he\ndid any evil, make report that he might suffer punishment. Then waving\nthe pair aside, without listening to their thanks or the acclamations of\nthe crowd, he passed on.\n\nAs we went down the ravine by which we had approached the village on the\nprevious night, a sound of chanting struck our ears. Presently the path\nturned, and we saw a solemn procession advancing up that dismal, sunless\ngorge. At the head of it rode none other than the beautiful Khania,\nfollowed by her great-uncle, the old Shaman, and after these came a\ncompany of shaven priests in their white robes, bearing between them a\nbier, upon which, its face uncovered, lay the body of the Khan, draped\nin a black garment. Yet he looked better thus than he had ever done, for\nnow death had touched this insane and dissolute man with something of\nthe dignity which he lacked in life.\n\nThus then we met. At the sight of our guide's white form, the horse\nwhich the Khania rode reared up so violently that I thought it would\nhave thrown her. But she mastered the animal with her whip and voice,\nand called out--\"Who is this draped hag of the Mountain that stops the\npath of the Khania Atene and her dead lord? My guests, I find you in ill\ncompany, for it seems that you are conducted by an evil spirit to meet\nan evil fate. That guide of yours must surely be something hateful and\nhideous, for were she a wholesome woman she would not fear to show her\nface.\"\n\nNow the Shaman plucked his mistress by the sleeve, and the priest\nOros, bowing to her, prayed her to be silent and cease to speak such\nill-omened words into the air, which might carry them she knew not\nwhither. But some instinctive hate seemed to bubble up in Atene, and\nshe would not be silent, for she addressed our guide using the direct\n\"thou,\" a manner of speech that we found was very usual on the Mountain\nthough rare upon the Plains.\n\n\"Let the air carry them whither it will,\" she cried. \"Sorceress, strip\noff thy rags, fit only for a corpse too vile to view. Show us what thou\nart, thou flitting night-owl, who thinkest to frighten me with that\nlivery of death, which only serves to hide the death within.\"\n\n\"Cease, I pray lady, cease,\" said Oros, stirred for once out of his\nimperturbable calm. \"She is the Minister, none other, and with her goes\nthe Power.\"\n\n\"Then it goes not against Atene, Khania of Kaloon,\" she answered, \"or so\nI think. Power, forsooth! Let her show her power. If she has any it is\nnot her own, but that of the Witch of the Mountain, who feigns to be a\nspirit, and by her sorceries has drawn away my guests\"--and she pointed\nto us--\"thus bringing my husband to his death.\"\n\n\"Niece, be silent!\" said the old Shaman, whose wrinkled face was white\nwith terror, whilst Oros held up his hands as though in supplication\nto some unseen Strength, saying--\"O thou that hearest and seest, be\nmerciful, I beseech thee, and forgive this woman her madness, lest the\nblood of a guest should stain the hands of thy servants, and the ancient\nhonour of our worship be brought low in the eyes of men.\"\n\nThus he prayed, but although his hands were uplifted, it seemed to me\nthat his eyes were fixed upon our guide, as ours were. While he spoke,\nI saw her hand raised, as she had raised it when she slew or rather\nsentenced the witchdoctor. Then she seemed to reflect, and stayed it in\nmid air, so that it pointed at the Khania. She did not move, she made\nno sound, only she pointed, and, the angry words died upon Atene's lips,\nthe fury left her eyes, and the colour her face. Yes, she grew white\nand silent as the corpse upon the bier behind her. Then, cowed by that\ninvisible power, she struck her horse so fiercely that it bounded by us\nonward towards the village, at which the funeral company were to rest\nawhile.\n\nAs the Shaman Simbri followed the Khania, the priest Oros caught his\nhorse's bridle and said to him--\"Magician, we have met before, for\ninstance, when your lady's father was brought to his funeral. Warn her,\nthen, you that know something of the truth and of her power to speak\nmore gently of the ruler of this land. Say to her, from me, that had she\nnot been the ambassadress of death, and, therefore, inviolate, surely\nere now she would have shared her husband's bier. Farewell, tomorrow we\nwill speak again,\" and, loosing the Shaman's bridle, Oros passed on.\n\nSoon we had left the melancholy procession behind us and, issuing from\nthe gorge, turned up the Mountain slope towards the edge of the bright\nsnows that lay not far above. It was as we came out of this darksome\nvalley, where the overhanging pine trees almost eclipsed the light, that\nsuddenly we missed our guide.\n\n\"Has she gone back to--to reason with the Khania?\" I asked of Oros.\n\n\"Nay!\" he answered, with a slight smile, \"I think that she has gone\nforward to give warning that the Hesea's guests draw near.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" I answered, staring hard at the bare slope of mountain,\nup which not a mouse could have passed without being seen. \"I\nunderstand--she has gone forward,\" and the matter dropped. But what\nI did _not_ understand was--how she had gone. As the Mountain was\nhoneycombed with caves and galleries, I suppose, however, that she\nentered one of them.\n\nAll the rest of that day we marched upwards, gradually drawing nearer to\nthe snow-line, as we went gathering what information we could from the\npriest Oros. This was the sum of it--From the beginning of the world,\nas he expressed it, that is, from thousands and thousands of years ago,\nthis Mountain had been the home of a peculiar fire-worship, of which the\nhead heirophant was a woman. About twenty centuries before, however, the\ninvading general named Rassen, had made himself Khan of Kaloon. Rassen\nestablished a new priestess on the Mountain, a worshipper of the\nEgyptian goddess, Hes, or Isis. This priestess had introduced certain\nmodifications in the ancient doctrines, superseding the cult of fire,\npure and simple, by a new faith, which, while holding to some of the old\nceremonies, revered as its head the Spirit of Life or Nature, of whom\nthey looked upon their priestess as the earthly representative.\n\nOf this priestess Oros would only tell us that she was \"ever present,\"\nalthough we gathered that when one priestess died or was \"taken to\nthe fire,\" as he put it, her child, whether in fact or by adoption,\nsucceeded her and was known by the same names, those of \"Hes\" or the\n\"Hesea\" and \"Mother.\" We asked if we should see this Mother, to which he\nanswered that she manifested herself very rarely. As to her appearance\nand attributes he would say nothing, except that the former changed from\ntime to time and that when she chose to use it she had \"all power.\"\n\nThe priests of her College, he informed us, numbered three hundred,\nnever more nor less, and there were also three hundred priestesses.\nCertain of those who desired it were allowed to marry, and from\namong their children were reared up the new generation of priests\nand priestesses. Thus they were a people apart from all others, with\ndistinct racial characteristics. This, indeed, was evident, for our\nescort were all exceedingly like to each other, very handsome and\nrefined in appearance, with dark eyes, clean-cut features and olive-hued\nskins; such a people as might well have descended from Easterns of high\nblood, with a dash of that of the Egyptians and Greeks thrown in.\n\nWe asked him whether the mighty looped pillar that towered from the\ntopmost cup of the Mountain was the work of men. He answered, No; the\nhand of Nature had fashioned it, and that the light shining through it\ncame from the fires which burned in the crater of the volcano. The first\npriestess, having recognized in this gigantic column the familiar Symbol\nof Life of the Egyptian worship, established her altars beneath its\nshadow.\n\nFor the rest, the Mountain with its mighty slopes and borderlands was\npeopled by a multitude of half-savage folk, who accepted the rule of the\nHesea, bringing her tribute of all things necessary, such as food and\nmetals. Much of the meat and grain however the priests raised themselves\non sheltered farms, and the metals they worked with their own hands.\nThis rule, however, was of a moral nature, since for centuries the\nCollege had sought no conquests and the Mother contented herself with\npunishing crime in some such fashion as we had seen. For the petty\nwars between the Tribes and the people of the Plain they were not\nresponsible, and those chiefs who carried them on were deposed, unless\nthey had themselves been attacked. All the Tribes, however, were sworn\nto the defence of the Hesea and the College, and, however much they\nmight quarrel amongst themselves, if need arose, were ready to die for\nher to the last man. That war must one day break out again between\nthe priests of the Mountain and the people of Kaloon was recognized;\ntherefore they endeavoured to be prepared for that great and final\nstruggle.\n\nSuch was the gist of his history, which, as we learned afterwards,\nproved to be true in every particular.\n\nTowards sundown we came to a vast cup extending over many thousand\nacres, situated beneath the snow-line of the peak and filled with rich\nsoil washed down, I suppose, from above. So sheltered was the place by\nits configuration and the over-hanging mountain that, facing south-west\nas it did, notwithstanding its altitude it produced corn and other\ntemperate crops in abundance. Here the College had its farms, and very\nwell cultivated these seemed to be. This great cup, which could not\nbe seen from below, we entered through a kind of natural gateway, that\nmight be easily defended against a host.\n\nThere were other peculiarities, but it is not necessary to describe them\nfurther than to say that I think the soil benefited by the natural heat\nof the volcano, and that when this erupted, as happened occasionally,\nthe lava streams always passed to the north and south of the cup of\nland. Indeed, it was these lava streams that had built up the protecting\ncliffs.\n\nCrossing the garden-like lands, we came to a small town beautifully\nbuilt of lava rock. Here dwelt the priests, except those who were on\nduty, no man of the Tribes or other stranger being allowed to set foot\nwithin the place.\n\nFollowing the main street of this town, we arrived at the face of the\nprecipice beyond, and found ourselves in front of a vast archway, closed\nwith massive iron gates fantastically wrought. Here, taking my horse\nwith them, our escort left us alone with Oros. As we drew near the great\ngates swung back upon their hinges. We passed them--with what sensations\nI cannot describe--and groped our way down a short corridor which ended\nin tall, iron-covered doors. These also rolled open at our approach, and\nnext instant we staggered back amazed and half-blinded by the intense\nblaze of light within.\n\nImagine, you who read, the nave of the vastest cathedral with which you\nare acquainted. Then double or treble its size, and you will have some\nconception of that temple in which we found ourselves. Perhaps in the\nbeginning it had been a cave, who can say? but now its sheer walls, its\nmultitudinous columns springing to the arched roof far above us, had all\nbeen worked on and fashioned by the labour of men long dead; doubtless\nthe old fire-worshippers of thousands of years ago.\n\nYou will wonder how so great a place was lighted, but I think that never\nwould you guess. Thus--by twisted columns of living flame! I counted\neighteen of them, but there may have been others. They sprang from the\nfloor at regular intervals along the lines of what in a cathedral would\nbe the aisles. Right to the roof they sprang, of even height and girth,\nso fierce was the force of the natural gas that drove them, and there\nwere lost, I suppose, through chimneys bored in the thickness of the\nrock. Nor did they give off smell or smoke, or in that great, cold\nplace, any heat which could be noticed, only an intense white light like\nthat of molten iron, and a sharp hissing noise as of a million angry\nsnakes.\n\nThe huge temple was utterly deserted, and, save for this sybilant,\npervading sound, utterly silent; an awesome, an overpowering place.\n\n\"Do these candles of yours ever go out?\" asked Leo of Oros, placing his\nhand before his dazzled eyes.\n\n\"How can they,\" replied the priest, in his smooth, matter-of-fact voice,\n\"seeing that they rise from the eternal fire which the builders of this\nhall worshipped? Thus they have burned from the beginning, and thus\nthey will burn for ever, though, if we wish it, we can shut off their\nlight.[*] Be pleased to follow me: you will see greater things.\"\n\n     [*] This, as I ascertained afterwards, was done by thrusting\n     a broad stone of great thickness over the apertures through\n     which the gas or fire rushed and thus cutting off the air.\n     These stones were worked to and fro by means of pulleys\n     connected with iron rods.--L. H. H.\n\nSo in awed silence we followed, and, oh! how small and miserable we\nthree human beings looked alone in that vast temple illuminated by this\nlightning radiance. We reached the end of it at length, only to find\nthat to right and left ran transepts on a like gigantic scale and lit in\nthe same amazing fashion. Here Oros bade us halt, and we waited a little\nwhile, till presently, from either transept arose a sound of chanting,\nand we perceived two white-robed processions advancing towards us from\ntheir depths.\n\nOn they came, very slowly, and we saw that the procession to the right\nwas a company of priests, and that to the left a company of priestesses,\na hundred or so of them in all.\n\nNow the men ranged themselves in front of us, while the women ranged\nthemselves behind, and at a signal from Oros, all of them still chanting\nsome wild and thrilling hymn, once more we started forward, this time\nalong a narrow gallery closed at the end with double wooden doors. As\nour procession reached these they opened, and before us lay the crowning\nwonder of this marvellous fane, a vast, ellipse-shaped apse. Now we\nunderstood. The plan of the temple was the plan of the looped pillar\nwhich stood upon the brow of the Peak, and as we rightly guessed, its\ndimensions were the same.\n\nAt intervals around this ellipse the fiery columns flared, but otherwise\nthe place was empty.\n\nNo, not quite, for at the head of the apse, almost between two of the\nflame columns, stood a plain, square altar of the size of a small room,\nin front of which, as we saw when we drew nearer, were hung curtains of\nwoven silver thread. On this altar was placed a large statue of silver,\nthat, backed as it was by the black rock, seemed to concentrate and\nreflect from its burnished surface the intense light of the two blazing\npillars.\n\nIt was a lovely thing, but to describe it is hard indeed. The figure,\nwhich was winged, represented a draped woman of mature years, and pure\nbut gracious form, half hidden by the forward-bending wings. Sheltered\nby these, yet shown between them, appeared the image of a male child,\nclasped to its bearer's breast with her left arm, while the right was\nraised toward the sky. A study of Motherhood, evidently, but how shall I\nwrite of all that was conveyed by those graven faces?\n\nTo begin with the child. It was that of a sturdy boy, full of health and\nthe joy of life. Yet he had been sleeping, and in his sleep some terror\nhad over-shadowed him with the dark shades of death and evil. There was\nfear in the lines of his sweet mouth and on the lips and cheeks, that\nseemed to quiver. He had thrown his little arm about his mother's neck,\nand, pressing close against her breast, looked up to her for safety, his\nright hand and outstretched finger pointing downwards and behind him, as\nthough to indicate whence the danger came. Yet it was passing, already\nhalf-forgotten, for the upturned eyes expressed confidence renewed,\npeace of soul attained.\n\nAnd the mother. She did not seem to mock or chide his fears, for\nher lovely face was anxious and alert. Yet upon it breathed a very\natmosphere of unchanging tenderness and power invincible; care for the\nhelpless, strength to shelter it from every harm. The great, calm eyes\ntold their story, the parted lips were whispering some tale of hope,\nsure and immortal; the raised hand revealed whence that hope arose. All\nlove seemed to be concentrated in the brooding figure, so human, yet so\ncelestial; all heaven seemed to lie an open path before those quivering\nwings. And see, the arching instep, the upward-springing foot, suggested\nthat thither those wings were bound, bearing their God-given burden far\nfrom the horror of the earth, deep into the bosom of a changeless rest\nabove.\n\nThe statue was only that of an affrighted child in its mother's\narms; its interpretation made clear even to the dullest by the simple\nsymbolism of some genius--Humanity saved by the Divine.\n\nWhile we gazed at its enchanting beauty, the priests and priestesses,\nfiling away to right and left, arranged themselves alternately, first a\nman and then a woman, within the ring of the columns of fire that burned\naround the loop-shaped shrine. So great was its circumference that the\nwhole hundred of them must stand wide apart one from another, and, to\nour sight, resembled little lonely children clad in gleaming garments,\nwhile their chant of worship reached us only like echoes thrown from\na far precipice. In short, the effect of this holy shrine and its\noccupants was superb yet overwhelming, at least I know that it filled me\nwith a feeling akin to fear.\n\nOros waited till the last priest had reached his appointed place. Then\nhe turned and said, in his gentle, reverent tones--\"Draw nigh, now, O\nWanderers well-beloved, and give greeting to the Mother,\" and he pointed\ntowards the statue.\n\n\"Where is she?\" asked Leo, in a whisper, for here we scarcely dared to\nspeak aloud. \"I see no one.\"\n\n\"The Hesea dwells yonder,\" he answered, and, taking each of us by the\nhand, he led us forward across the great emptiness of the apse to the\naltar at its head.\n\nAs we drew near the distant chant of the priests gathered in volume,\nassuming a glad, triumphant note, and it seemed to me--though this,\nperhaps was fancy--that the light from the twisted columns of flame grew\neven brighter.\n\nAt length we were there, and, Oros, loosing our hands, prostrated\nhimself thrice before the altar. Then he rose again, and, falling behind\nus, stood in silence with bent head and folded fingers. We stood silent\nalso, our hearts filled with mingled hope and fear like a cup with wine.\n\nWere our labours ended? Had we found her whom we sought, or were we,\nperchance, but enmeshed in the web of some marvellous mummery and\nabout to make acquaintance with the secret of another new and mystical\nworship? For years and years we had searched, enduring every hardness of\nflesh and spirit that man can suffer, and now we were to learn whether\nwe had endured in vain. Yes, and Leo would learn if the promise was\nto be fulfilled to him, or whether she whom he adored had become but a\ndeparted dream to be sought for only beyond the gate of Death. Little\nwonder that he trembled and turned white in the agony of that great\nsuspense.\n\nLong, long was the time. Hours, years, ages, aeons, seemed to flow over\nus as we stood there before glittering silver curtains that hid the\nfront of the black altar beneath the mystery of the sphinx-like face\nof the glorious image which was its guardian, clothed with that frozen\nsmile of eternal love and pity. All the past went before us as we\nstruggled in those dark waters of our doubt. Item by item, event by\nevent, we rehearsed the story which began in the Caves of Kor, for our\nthoughts, so long attuned, were open to each other and flashed from soul\nto soul.\n\nOh! now we knew, they were open also to _another_ soul. We could see\nnothing save the Altar and the Effigy, we could only hear the slow chant\nof the priests and priestesses and the snake-like hiss of the rushing\nfires. Yet we knew that our hearts were as an open book to One who\nwatched beneath the Mother's shadowing wings.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHE COURT OF DEATH\n\nNow the curtains were open. Before us appeared a chamber hollowed from\nthe thickness of the altar, and in its centre a throne, and on the\nthrone a figure clad in waves of billowy white flowing from the head\nover the arms of the throne down to its marble steps. We could see no\nmore in the comparative darkness of that place, save that beneath the\nfolds of the drapery the Oracle held in its hand a loop-shaped, jewelled\nsceptre.\n\nMoved by some impulse, we did as Oros had done, prostrating ourselves,\nand there remained upon our knees. At length we heard a tinkling as of\nlittle bells, and, looking up, saw that the sistrum-shaped sceptre was\nstretched towards us by the draped arm which held it. Then a thin, clear\nvoice spoke, and I thought that it trembled a little. It spoke in Greek,\nbut in a much purer Greek than all these people used.\n\n\"I greet you, Wanderers, who have journeyed so far to visit this most\nancient shrine, and although doubtless of some other faith, are not\nashamed to do reverence to that unworthy one who is for this time its\nOracle and the guardian of its mysteries. Rise now and have no fear of\nme; for have I not sent my Messenger and servants to conduct you to this\nSanctuary?\"\n\nSlowly we rose, and stood silent, not knowing what to say.\n\n\"I greet you, Wanderers,\" the voice repeated. \"Tell me thou\"--and the\nsceptre pointed towards Leo--\"how art thou named?\"\n\n\"I am named Leo Vincey,\" he answered.\n\n\"Leo Vincey! I like the name, which to me well befits a man so goodly.\nAnd thou, the companion of--Leo Vincey?\"\n\n\"I am named Horace Holly.\"\n\n\"So. Then tell me, Leo Vincey and Horace Holly, what came ye so far to\nseek?\"\n\nWe looked at each other, and I said--\"The tale is long and strange.\nO--but by what title must we address thee?\"\n\n\"By the name which I bear here, Hes.\"\n\n\"O Hes,\" I said, wondering what name she bore elsewhere.\n\n\"Yet I desire to hear that tale,\" she went on, and to me her voice\nsounded eager. \"Nay, not all to-night, for I know that you both are\nweary; a little of it only. In sooth, Strangers, there is a sameness in\nthis home of contemplations, and no heart can feed only on the past, if\nsuch a thing there be. Therefore I welcome a new history from the world\nwithout. Tell it me, thou, Leo, as briefly as thou wilt, so that thou\ntell the truth, for in the Presence of which I am a Minister, may\nnothing else be uttered.\"\n\n\"Priestess,\" he said, in his curt fashion, \"I obey. Many years ago when\nI was young, my friend and foster-father and I, led by records of the\npast, travelled to a wild land, and there found a certain divine woman\nwho had conquered time.\"\n\n\"Then that woman must have been both aged and hideous.\"\n\n\"I said, Priestess, that she had conquered time, not suffered it, for\nthe gift of immortal youth was hers. Also she was not hideous; she was\nbeauty itself.\"\n\n\"Therefore stranger, thou didst worship her for her beauty's sake, as a\nman does.\"\n\n\"I did not worship her; I loved her, which is another thing. The priest\nOros here worships thee, whom he calls Mother. I loved that immortal\nwoman.\"\n\n\"Then thou shouldst love her still. Yet, not so, since love is very\nmortal.\"\n\n\"I love her still,\" he answered, \"although she died.\"\n\n\"Why, how is that? Thou saidst she was immortal.\"\n\n\"Perchance she only seemed to die; perchance she changed. At least I\nlost her, and what I lost I seek, and have sought this many a year.\"\n\n\"Why dost thou seek her in my Mountain, Leo Vincey?\"\n\n\"Because a vision led me to ask counsel of its Oracle. I am come hither\nto learn tidings of my lost love, since here alone these may be found.\"\n\n\"And thou, Holly, didst thou also love an immortal woman whose\nimmortality, it seems, must bow to death?\"\n\n\"Priestess,\" I answered, \"I am sworn to this quest, and where my\nfoster-son goes I follow. He follows beauty that is dead----\"\n\n\"And thou dost follow him. Therefore both of you follow beauty as men\nhave ever done, being blind and mad.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" I answered, \"if they were blind, beauty would be naught to them\nwho could not see it, and if they were mad, they would not know it when\nit was seen. Knowledge and vision belong to the wise, O Hes.\"\n\n\"Thou art quick of wit and tongue, Holly, as----\" and she checked\nherself, then of a sudden, said, \"Tell me, did my servant the Khania of\nKaloon entertain both of you hospitably in her city, and speed you on\nyour journey hither, as I commanded her?\"\n\n\"We knew not that she was thy servant,\" I replied. \"Hospitality we\nhad and to spare, but we were sped from her Court hitherward by the\ndeath-hounds of the Khan, her husband. Tell us, Priestess, what thou\nknowest of this journey of ours.\"\n\n\"A little,\" she answered carelessly. \"More than three moons ago my\nspies saw you upon the far mountains, and, creeping very close to you at\nnight, heard you speak together of the object of your wanderings, then,\nreturning thence swiftly, made report to me. Thereon I bade the Khania\nAtene, and that old magician her great-uncle, who is Guardian of the\nGate, go down to the ancient gates of Kaloon to receive you and bring\nyou hither with all speed. Yet for men who burned to learn the answer to\na riddle, you have been long in coming.\"\n\n\"We came as fast as we might, O Hes,\" said Leo; \"and if thy spies could\nvisit those mountains, where no man was, and find a path down that\nhideous precipice, they must have been able also to tell thee the reason\nof our delay. Therefore I pray, ask it not of us.\"\n\n\"Nay, I will ask it of Atene herself, and she shall surely answer me,\nfor she stands without,\" replied the Hesea in a cold voice. \"Oros, lead\nthe Khania hither and be swift.\"\n\nThe priest turned and walking quickly to the wooden doors by which we\nhad entered the shrine, vanished there.\n\n\"Now,\" said Leo to me nervously in the silence that followed, and\nspeaking in English, \"now I wish we were somewhere else, for I think\nthat there will be trouble.\"\n\n\"I don't think, I am sure,\" I answered; \"but the more the better,\nfor out of trouble may come the truth, which we need sorely.\" Then I\nstopped, reflecting that the strange woman before us said that her spies\nhad overheard our talk upon the mountains, where we had spoken nothing\nbut English.\n\nAs it proved, I was wise, for quite quietly the Hesea repeated after\nme--\"Thou hast experience, Holly, for out of trouble comes the truth, as\nout of wine.\"\n\nThen she was silent, and, needless to say, I did not pursue the\nconversation.\n\nThe doors swung open, and through them came a procession clad in black,\nfollowed by the Shaman Simbri, who walked in front of a bier, upon which\nlay the body of the Khan, carried by eight priests. Behind it was Atene,\ndraped in a black veil from head to foot, and after her marched another\ncompany of priests. In front of the altar the bier was set down and the\npriests fell back, leaving Atene and her uncle standing alone before the\ncorpse.\n\n\"What seeks my vassal, the Khania of Kaloon?\" asked the Hesea in a cold\nvoice.\n\nNow Atene advanced and bent the knee, but with little graciousness.\n\n\"Ancient Mother, Mother from of old, I do reverence to thy holy Office,\nas my forefathers have done for many a generation,\" and again she\ncurtseyed. \"Mother, this dead man asks of thee that right of sepulchre\nin the fires of the holy Mountain which from the beginning has been\naccorded to the royal departed who went before him.\"\n\n\"It has been accorded as thou sayest,\" answered the Hesea, \"by those\npriestesses who filled my place before me, nor shall it be refused to\nthy dead lord--or to thee Atene--when thy time comes.\"\n\n\"I thank thee, O Hes, and I pray that this decree may be written down,\nfor the snows of age have gathered on thy venerable head and soon thou\nmust leave us for awhile. Therefore bid thy scribes that it be written\ndown, so that the Hesea who rules after thee may fulfil it in its\nseason.\"\n\n\"Cease,\" said the Hesea, \"cease to pour out thy bitterness at that which\nshould command thy reverence, oh! thou foolish child, who dost not know\nbut that to-morrow the fire shall claim the frail youth and beauty which\nare thy boast. I bid thee cease, and tell me how did death find this\nlord of thine?\"\n\n\"Ask those wanderers yonder, that were his guests, for his blood is on\ntheir heads and cries for vengeance at thy hands.\"\n\n\"I killed him,\" said Leo, \"to save my own life. He tried to hunt us down\nwith his dogs, and there are the marks of them,\" and he pointed to my\narm. \"The priest Oros knows, for he dressed the hurts.\"\n\n\"How did this chance?\" asked the Hesea of Atene.\n\n\"My lord was mad,\" she answered boldly, \"and such was his cruel sport.\"\n\n\"So. And was thy lord jealous also? Nay, keep back the falsehood I see\nrising to thy lips. Leo Vincey, answer thou me. Yet, I will not ask thee\nto lay bare the secrets of a woman who has offered thee her love. Thou,\nHolly, speak, and let it be the truth.\"\n\n\"It is this, O Hes,\" I answered. \"Yonder lady and her uncle the Shaman\nSimbri saved us from death in the waters of the river that bounds\nthe precipices of Kaloon. Afterwards we were ill, and they treated us\nkindly, but the Khania became enamoured of my foster-son.\"\n\nHere the figure of the Priestess stirred beneath its gauzy wrappings,\nand the Voice asked--\"And did thy foster-son become enamoured of the\nKhania, as being a man he may well have done, for without doubt she is\nfair?\"\n\n\"He can answer that question for himself, O Hes. All I know is that he\nstrove to escape from her, and that in the end she gave him a day to\nchoose between death and marriage with her, when her lord should be\ndead. So, helped by the Khan, her husband, who was jealous of him, we\nfled towards this Mountain, which we desired to reach. Then the Khan set\nhis hounds upon us, for he was mad and false-hearted. We killed him and\ncame on in spite of this lady, his wife, and her uncle, who would have\nprevented us, and were met in a Place of Bones by a certain veiled\nguide, who led us up the Mountain and twice saved us from death. That is\nall the story.\"\n\n\"Woman, what hast thou to say?\" asked the Hesea in a menacing voice.\n\n\"But little,\" Atene answered, without flinching. \"For years I have been\nbound to a madman and a brute, and if my fancy wandered towards this man\nand his fancy wandered towards me--well, Nature spoke to us, and that is\nall. Afterwards it seems that he grew afraid of the vengeance of Rassen,\nor this Holly, whom I would that the hounds had torn bone from bone,\ngrew afraid. So they strove to escape the land, and perchance wandered\nto thy Mountain. But I weary of this talk, and ask thy leave to rest\nbefore to-morrow's rite.\"\n\n\"Thou sayest, Atene,\" said the Hesea, \"that Nature spoke to this man\nand to thee, and that his heart is thine; but that, fearing thy lord's\nvengeance, he fled from thee, he who seems no coward. Tell me, then,\nis that tress he hides in the satchel on his breast thy gage of love to\nhim?\"\n\n\"I know nothing of what he hides in the satchel,\" answered the Khania\nsullenly.\n\n\"And yet, yonder in the Gatehouse when he lay so sick he set the lock\nagainst thine own--ah, dost remember now?\"\n\n\"So, O Hes, already he has told thee all our secrets, though they\nbe such as most men hide within their breasts;\" and she looked\ncontemptuously at Leo.\n\n\"I told her nothing of the matter, Khania,\" Leo said in an angry voice.\n\n\"Nay, _thou_ toldest me nothing, Wanderer; my watching wisdom told me.\nOh, didst thou think, Atene, that thou couldst hide the truth from the\nall-seeing Hesea of the Mountain? If so, spare thy breath, for I know\nall, and have known it from the first. I passed thy disobedience by; of\nthy false messages I took no heed. For my own purposes I, to whom time\nis naught, suffered even that thou shouldst hold these, my guests, thy\nprisoners whilst thou didst strive by threats and force to win a love\ndenied.\"\n\nShe paused, then went on coldly: \"Woman, I tell thee that, to complete\nthy sin, thou hast even dared to lie to me here, in my very Sanctuary.\"\n\n\"If so, what of it?\" was the bold answer. \"Dost thou love the man\nthyself? Nay, it is monstrous. Nature would cry aloud at such a shame.\nOh! tremble not with rage. Hes, I know thy evil powers, but I know also\nthat I am thy guest, and that in this hallowed place, beneath yonder\nsymbol of eternal Love, thou may'st shed no blood. More, thou canst not\nharm me, Hes, who am thy equal.\"\n\n\"Atene,\" replied the measured Voice, \"did I desire it, I could destroy\nthee where thou art. Yet thou art right, I shall not harm thee, thou\nfaithless servant. Did not my writ bid thee through yonder searcher\nof the stars, thy uncle, to meet these guests of mine and bring them\nstraight to my shrine? Tell me, for I seek to know, how comes it that\nthou didst disobey me?\"\n\n\"Have then thy desire,\" answered Atene in a new and earnest voice,\ndevoid now of bitterness and falsehood. \"I disobeyed because that man is\nnot thine, but mine, and no other woman's; because I love him and have\nloved him from of old. Aye, since first our souls sprang into life I\nhave loved him, as he has loved me. My own heart tells me so; the magic\nof my uncle here tells me so, though how and where and when these things\nhave been I know not. Therefore I come to thee, Mother of Mysteries,\nGuardian of the secrets of the past, to learn the truth. At least _thou_\ncanst not lie at thine own altar, and I charge thee, by the dread name\nof that Power to which thou also must render thy account, that thou\nanswer now and here.\n\n\"Who is this man to whom my being yearns? What has he been to me? What\nhas he to do with thee? Speak, O Oracle and make the secret clear.\nSpeak, I command, even though afterwards thou dost slay me--if thou\ncanst.\"\n\n\"Aye, speak! speak!\" said Leo, \"for know I am in sore suspense. I also\nam bewildered by memories and rent with hopes and fears.\"\n\nAnd I too echoed, \"Speak!\"\n\n\"Leo Vincey,\" asked the Hesea, after she had thought awhile, \"whom dost\nthou believe me to be?\"\n\n\"I believe,\" he answered solemnly, \"that thou art that Ayesha at whose\nhands I died of old in the Caves of Kor in Africa. I believe thou art\nthat Ayesha whom not twenty years ago I found and loved in those same\nCaves of Kor, and there saw perish miserably, swearing that thou wouldst\nreturn again.\"\n\n\"See now, how madness can mislead a man,\" broke in Atene triumphantly.\n\"'Not twenty years ago,' he said, whereas I know well that more than\neighty summers have gone by since my grandsire in his youth saw this\nsame priestess sitting on the Mother's throne.\"\n\n\"And whom dost thou believe me to be, O Holly?\" the Priestess asked,\ntaking no note of the Khania's words.\n\n\"What he believes I believe,\" I answered. \"The dead come back to\nlife--sometimes. Yet alone thou knowest the truth, and by thee only it\ncan be revealed.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" she said, as though musing, \"the dead come back to\nlife--sometimes--and in strange shape, and, mayhap, I know the truth.\nTo-morrow when yonder body is borne on high for burial we will speak\nof it again. Till then rest you all, and prepare to face that fearful\nthing--the Truth.\"\n\nWhile the Hesea still spoke the silvery curtains swung to their place\nas mysteriously as they had opened. Then, as though at some signal, the\nblack-robed priests advanced. Surrounding Atene, they led her from the\nSanctuary, accompanied by her uncle the Shaman, who, as it seemed to me,\neither through fatigue or fear, could scarcely stand upon his feet, but\nstood blinking his dim eyes as though the light dazed him. When these\nwere gone, the priests and priestesses, who all this time had been\nranged round the walls, far out of hearing of our talk, gathered\nthemselves into their separate companies, and still chanting, departed\nalso, leaving us alone with Oros and the corpse of the Khan, which\nremained where it had been set down.\n\nNow the head-priest Oros beckoned to us to follow him, and we went\nalso. Nor was I sorry to leave the place, for its death-like\nloneliness--enhanced, strangely enough, as it was, by the flood of light\nthat filled it; a loneliness which was concentrated and expressed in the\nawful figure stretched upon the bier, oppressed and overcame us, whose\nnerves were broken by all that we had undergone. Thankful enough was I\nwhen, having passed the transepts and down the length of the vast nave,\nwe came to the iron doors, the rock passage, and the outer gates, which,\nas before, opened to let us through, and so at last into the sweet, cold\nair of the night at that hour which precedes the dawn.\n\nOros led us to a house well-built and furnished, where at his bidding,\nlike men in a dream, we drank of some liquor which he gave us. I think\nthat drink was drugged, at least after swallowing it I remembered no\nmore till I awoke to find myself lying on a bed and feeling wonderfully\nstrong and well. This I thought strange, for a lamp burning in the room\nshowed me that it was still dark, and therefore that I could have rested\nbut a little time.\n\nI tried to sleep again, but was not able, so fell to thinking till I\ngrew weary of the task. For here thoughts would not help me; nothing\ncould help, except the truth, \"that fearful thing,\" as the veiled\nPriestess had called it.\n\nOh! what if she should prove not the Ayesha whom we desired, but some\n\"fearful thing\"? What were the meaning of the Khania's hints and of\nher boldness, that surely had been inspired by the strength of a hidden\nknowledge? What if--nay, it could not be--I would rise and dress my arm.\nOr I would wake Leo and make him dress it--anything to occupy my mind\nuntil the appointed hour, when we must learn--the best--or the worst.\n\nI sat up in the bed and saw a figure advancing towards me. It was Oros,\nwho bore a lamp in his hand.\n\n\"You have slept long, friend Holly,\" he said, \"and now it is time to be\nup and doing.\"\n\n\"Long?\" I answered testily. \"How can that be, when it is still dark?\"\n\n\"Because, friend, the dark is that of a new night. Many hours have gone\nby since you lay down upon this bed. Well, you were wise to rest you\nwhile you may, for who knows when you will sleep again! Come, let me\nbathe your arm.\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" I broke in----\"Nay, friend,\" he interrupted firmly, \"I will\ntell you nothing, except that soon you must start to be present at\nthe funeral of the Khan, and, perchance, to learn the answer to your\nquestions.\"\n\nTen minutes later he led me to the eating-chamber of the house, where I\nfound Leo already dressed, for Oros had awakened him before he came to\nme and bidden him to prepare himself. Oros told us here that the Hesea\nhad not suffered us to be disturbed until the night came again since we\nhad much to undergo that day. So presently we started.\n\nOnce more we were led through the flame-lit hall till we came to the\nloop-shaped apse. The place was empty now, even the corpse of the Khan\nhad gone, and no draped Oracle sat in the altar shrine, for its silver\ncurtains were drawn, and we saw that it was untenanted.\n\n\"The Mother has departed to do honour to the dead, according to the\nancient custom,\" Oros explained to us.\n\nThen we passed the altar, and behind the statue found a door in the\nrock wall of the apse, and beyond the door a passage, and a hall as of a\nhouse, for out of it opened other doors leading to chambers. These, our\nguide told us, were the dwelling-places of the Hesea and her maidens.\nHe added that they ran to the side of the Mountain and had windows that\nopened on to gardens and let in the light and air. In this hall six\npriests were waiting, each of whom carried a bundle of torches beneath\nhis arm and held in his hand a lighted lamp.\n\n\"Our road runs through the dark,\" said Oros, \"though were it day we\nmight climb the outer snows, but this at night it is dangerous to do.\"\n\nThen taking torches, he lit them at a lamp and gave one to each of us.\n\nNow our climb began. Up endless sloping galleries we went, hewn with\ninconceivable labour by the primeval fire-worshippers from the living\nrock of the Mountain. It seemed to me that they stretched for miles, and\nindeed this was so, since, although the slope was always gentle, it took\nus more than an hour to climb them. At length we came to the foot of a\ngreat stair.\n\n\"Rest awhile here, my lord,\" Oros said, bowing to Leo with the reverence\nthat he had shown him from the first, \"for this stair is steep and long.\nNow we stand upon the Mountain's topmost lip, and are about to climb\nthat tall looped column which soars above.\"\n\nSo we sat down in the vault-like place and let the sharp draught of air\nrushing to and from the passages play upon us, for we were heated with\njourneying up those close galleries. As we sat thus I heard a roaring\nsound and asked Oros what it might be. He answered that we were very\nnear to the crater of the volcano, and that what we heard through the\nthickness of the rock was the rushing of its everlasting fires. Then the\nascent commenced.\n\nIt was not dangerous though very wearisome, for there were nearly six\nhundred of those steps. The climb of the passages had reminded me of\nthat of the gallery of the Great Pyramid drawn out for whole furlongs;\nthat of the pillar was like the ascent of a cathedral spire, or rather\nof several spires piled one upon another.\n\nResting from time to time, we dragged ourselves up the steep steps, each\nof them quite a foot in height, till the pillar was climbed and only the\nloop remained. Up it we went also, Oros leading us, and glad was I that\nthe stairway still ran within the substance of the rock, for I could\nfeel the needle's mighty eye quiver in the rush of the winds which swept\nabout its sides.\n\nAt length we saw light before us, and in another twenty steps emerged\nupon a platform. As Leo, who went in front of me, walked from the\nstairway I saw Oros and another priest seize him by the arms, and called\nto him to ask what they were doing.\n\n\"Nothing,\" he cried back, \"except that this is a dizzy place and they\nfeared lest I should fall. Mind how you come, Horace,\" and he stretched\nout his hand to me.\n\nNow I was clear of the tunnel, and I believe that had it not been for\nthat hand I should have sunk to the rocky floor, for the sight before me\nseemed to paralyse my brain. Nor was this to be wondered at, for I doubt\nwhether the world can show such another.\n\nWe stood upon the very apex of the loop, a flat space of rock about\neighty yards in length by some thirty in breadth, with the star-strewn\nsky above us. To the south, twenty thousand feet or more below,\nstretched the dim Plain of Kaloon, and to the east and west the\nsnow-clad shoulders of the peak and the broad brown slopes beneath.\nTo the north was a different sight, and one more awesome. There, right\nunder us as it seemed, for the pillar bent inwards, lay the vast crater\nof the volcano, and in the centre of it a wide lake of fire that broke\ninto bubbles and flowers of sudden flame or spouted, writhed and twisted\nlike an angry sea.\n\nFrom the surface of this lake rose smoke and gases that took fire as\nthey floated upwards, and, mingling together, formed a gigantic sheet of\nliving light. Right opposite to us burned this sheet and, the flare of\nit passing through the needle-eye of the pillar under us, sped away in\none dazzling beam across the country of Kaloon, across the mountains\nbeyond, till it was lost on the horizon.\n\nThe wind blew from south to north, being sucked in towards the hot\ncrater of the volcano, and its fierce breath, that screamed through the\neye of the pillar and against its rugged surface, bent the long crest\nof the sheet of flame, as an ocean roller is bent over by the gale, and\ntore from it fragments of fire, that floated away to leeward like the\nblown-out sails of a burning ship.\n\nHad it not been for this strong and steady wind indeed, no creature\ncould have lived upon the pillar, for the vapours would have poisoned\nhim; but its unceasing blast drove these all away towards the north. For\nthe same reason, in the thin air of that icy place the heat was not too\ngreat to be endured.\n\nAppalled by that terrific spectacle, which seemed more appropriate to\nthe terrors of the Pit than to this earth of ours, and fearful lest the\nblast should whirl me like a dead leaf into the glowing gulf beneath, I\nfell on to my sound hand and my knees, shouting to Leo to do likewise,\nand looked about me. Now I observed lines of priests wrapped in great\ncapes, kneeling upon the face of the rock and engaged apparently in\nprayer, but of Hes the Mother, or of Atene, or of the corpse of the dead\nKhan I could see nothing.\n\nWhilst I wondered where they might be, Oros, upon whose nerves this\ndread scene appeared to have no effect, and some of our attendant\npriests surrounded us and led us onwards by a path that ran perilously\nnear to the rounded edge of the rock. A few downward steps and we found\nthat we were under shelter, for the gale was roaring over us. Twenty\nmore paces and we came to a recess cut, I suppose, by man in the face\nof the loop, in such fashion that a lava roof was left projecting half\nacross its width.\n\nThis recess, or rock chamber, which was large enough to shelter a great\nnumber of people, we reached safely, to discover that it was already\ntenanted. Seated in a chair hewn from the rock was the Hesea, wearing\na broidered, purple mantle above her gauzy wrappings that enveloped\nher from head to foot. There, too, standing near to her were the Khania\nAtene and her uncle the old Shaman, who looked but ill at ease, and\nlastly, stretched upon his funeral couch, the fiery light beating upon\nhis stark form and face, lay the dead Khan, Rassen.\n\nWe advanced to the throne and bowed to her who sat thereon. The Hesea\nlifted her hooded head, which seemed to have been sunk upon her breast\nas though she were overcome by thought or care, and addressed Oros the\npriest. For in the shelter of those massive walls by comparison there\nwas silence and folk could hear each other speak.\n\n\"So thou hast brought them safely, my servant,\" she said, \"and I am\nglad, for to those that know it not this road is fearful. My guests,\nwhat say you of the burying-pit of the Children of Hes?\"\n\n\"Our faith tells us of a hell, lady,\" answered Leo, \"and I think that\nyonder cauldron looks like its mouth.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" she answered, \"there is no hell, save that which from life to\nlife we fashion for ourselves within the circle of this little star. Leo\nVincey, I tell thee that hell is here, aye, _here_,\" and she struck her\nhand upon her breast, while once more her head drooped forward as though\nbowed down beneath some load of secret misery.\n\nThus she stayed awhile, then lifted it and spoke again,\nsaying--\"Midnight is past, and much must be done and suffered before the\ndawn. Aye, the darkness must be turned to light, or perchance the light\nto eternal darkness.\"\n\n\"Royal woman,\" she went on, addressing Atene, \"as is his right, thou\nhast brought thy dead lord hither for burial in this consecrated place,\nwhere the ashes of all who went before him have become fuel for the\nholy fires. Oros, my priest, summon thou the Accuser and him who makes\ndefence, and let the books be opened that I may pass my judgment on the\ndead, and call his soul to live again, or pray that from it the breath\nof life may be withheld.\n\n\"Priest, I say the Court of Death is open.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nTHE SECOND ORDEAL\n\nOros bowed and left the place, whereon the Hesea signed to us to stand\nupon her right and to Atene to stand upon her left. Presently from\neither side the hooded priests and priestesses stole into the chamber,\nand to the number of fifty or more ranged themselves along its walls.\nThen came two figures draped in black and masked, who bore parchment\nbooks in their hands, and placed themselves on either side of the\ncorpse, while Oros stood at its feet, facing the Hesea.\n\nNow she lifted the sistrum that she held, and in obedience to the signal\nOros said--\"Let the books be opened.\"\n\nThereon the masked Accuser to the right broke the seal of his book and\nbegan to read its pages. It was a tale of the sins of this dead man\nentered as fully as though that officer were his own conscience given\nlife and voice. In cold and horrible detail it told of the evil doings\nof his childhood, of his youth, and of his riper years, and thus massed\ntogether the record was black indeed.\n\nI listened amazed, wondering what spy had been set upon the deeds of\nyonder man throughout his days; thinking also with a shudder of how\nheavy would be the tale against any one of us, if such a spy should\ncompanion him from the cradle to the grave; remembering too that\nfull surely this count is kept by scribes even more watchful than the\nministers of Hes.\n\nAt length the long story drew to its close. Lastly it told of the murder\nof that noble upon the banks of the river; it told of the plot against\nour lives for no just cause; it told of our cruel hunting with the\ndeath-hounds, and of its end. Then the Accuser shut his book and cast it\non the ground, saying--\"Such is the record, O Mother. Sum it up as thou\nhast been given wisdom.\"\n\nWithout speaking, the Hesea pointed with her sistrum to the Defender,\nwho thereon broke the seal of his book and began to read.\n\nIts tale spoke of all the good that the dead man had done; of every\nnoble word that he had said, of every kind action; of plans which he had\nmade for the welfare of his vassals; of temptations to ill that he had\nresisted; of the true love that he had borne to the woman who became his\nwife; of the prayers which he had made and of the offerings which he had\nsent to the temple of Hes.\n\nMaking no mention of her name, it told of how that wife of his had hated\nhim, of how she and the magician, who had fostered and educated her, and\nwas her relative and guide, had set other women to lead him astray that\nshe might be free of him. Of how too they had driven him mad with a\npoisonous drink which took away his judgment, unchained all the evil in\nhis heart, and caused him by its baneful influence to shrink unnaturally\nfrom her whose love he still desired.\n\nAlso it set out that the heaviest of his crimes were inspired by this\nwife of his, who sought to befoul his name in the ears of the people\nwhom she led him to oppress, and how bitter jealousy drove him to cruel\nacts, the last and worst of which caused him foully to violate the law\nof hospitality, and in attempting to bring about the death of blameless\nguests at their hands to find his own.\n\nThus the Defender read, and having read, closed the book and threw it\non the ground, saying--\"Such is the record, O Mother, sum it up as thou\nhast been given wisdom.\"\n\nThen the Khania, who all this time had stood cold and impassive, stepped\nforward to speak, and with her her uncle, the Shaman Simbri. But before\na word passed Atene's lips the Hesea raised her sceptre and forbade\nthem, saying--\"Thy day of trial is not yet, nor have we aught to do with\nthee. When thou liest where he lies and the books of thy deeds are read\naloud to her who sits in judgment, then let thine advocate make answer\nfor these things.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" answered Atene haughtily and fell back.\n\nNow it was the turn of the high-priest Oros. \"Mother,\" he said, \"thou\nhast heard. Balance the writings, assess the truth, and according to thy\nwisdom, issue thy commands. Shall we hurl him who was Rassen feet first\ninto the fiery gulf, that he may walk again in the paths of life, or\nhead first, in token that he is dead indeed?\"\n\nThen while all waited in a hushed expectancy, the great Priestess\ndelivered her verdict.\n\n\"I hear, I balance, I assess, but judge I do not, who claim no such\npower. Let the Spirit who sent him forth, to whom he is returned again,\npass judgment on his spirit. This dead one has sinned deeply, yet has\nhe been more deeply sinned against. Nor against that man can be reckoned\nthe account of his deeds of madness. Cast him then to his grave feet\nfirst that his name may be whitened in the ears of those unborn, and\nthat thence he may return again at the time appointed. It is spoken.\"\n\nNow the Accuser lifted the book of his accusations from the ground and,\nadvancing, hurled it into the gulf in token that it was blotted out.\nThen he turned and vanished from the chamber; while the Advocate, taking\nup his book, gave it into the keeping of the priest Oros, that it might\nbe preserved in the archives of the temple for ever. This done, the\npriests began a funeral chant and a solemn invocation to the great Lord\nof the Under-world that he would receive this spirit and acquit it there\nas here it had been acquitted by the Hesea, his minister.\n\nEre their dirge ended certain of the priests, advancing with slow steps,\nlifted the bier and carried it to the edge of the gulf; then at a sign\nfrom the Mother, hurled it feet foremost into the fiery lake below,\nwhilst all watched to see how it struck the flame. For this they held to\nbe an omen, since should the body turn over in its descent it was taken\nas a sign that the judgment of mortal men had been refused in the Place\nof the Immortals. It did not turn; it rushed downwards straight as a\nplummet and plunged into the fire hundreds of feet below, and there\nfor ever vanished. This indeed was not strange since, as we discovered\nafterwards, the feet were weighted.\n\nIn fact this solemn rite was but a formula that, down to the exact\nwords of judgment and committal, had been practised here from unknown\nantiquity over the bodies of the priests and priestesses of the\nMountain, and of certain of the great ones of the Plain. So it was in\nancient Egypt, whence without doubt this ceremony of the trial of the\ndead was derived, and so it continued to be in the land of Hes, for no\npriestess ever ventured to condemn the soul of one departed.\n\nThe real interest of the custom, apart from its solemnity and awful\nsurroundings, centred in the accurate knowledge displayed by the masked\nAccuser and Advocate of the life-deeds of the deceased. It showed that\nalthough the College of Hes affected to be indifferent to the doings and\npolitics of the people of the Plain that they once ruled and over which,\nwhilst secretly awaiting an opportunity of re-conquest, they still\nclaimed a spiritual authority, the attitude was assumed rather than\nreal. Moreover it suggested a system of espionage so piercing and\nextraordinary that it was difficult to believe it unaided by the\nhabitual exercise of some gift of clairvoyance.\n\nThe service, if I may call it so, was finished; the dead man had\nfollowed the record of his sins into that lurid sea of fire, and by\nnow was but a handful of charred dust. But if his book had closed, ours\nremained open and at its strangest chapter. We knew it, all of us, and\nwaited, our nerves thrilled, with expectancy.\n\nThe Hesea sat brooding on her rocky throne. She also knew that the hour\nhad come. Presently she sighed, then motioned with her sceptre and spoke\na word or two, dismissing the priests and priestesses, who departed\nand were seen no more. Two of them remained however, Oros and the head\npriestess who was called Papave, a young woman of a noble countenance.\n\n\"Listen, my servants,\" she said. \"Great things are about to happen,\nwhich have to do with the coming of yonder strangers, for whom I have\nwaited these many years as is well known to you. Nor can I tell the\nissue since to me, to whom power is given so freely, foresight of the\nfuture is denied. It well may happen, therefore, that this seat will\nsoon be empty and this frame but food for the eternal fires. Nay, grieve\nnot, grieve not, for I do not die and if so, the spirit shall return\nagain.\n\n\"Hearken, Papave. Thou art of the blood, and to thee alone have I opened\nall the doors of wisdom. If I pass now or at any time, take thou the\nancient power, fill thou my place, and in all things do as I have\ninstructed thee, that from this Mountain light may shine upon the world.\nFurther I command thee, and thee also, Oros my priest, that if I be\nsummoned hence you entertain these strangers hospitably until it is\npossible to escort them from the land, whether by the road they came or\nacross the northern hills and deserts. Should the Khania Atene attempt\nto detain them against their will, then raise the Tribes upon her in the\nname of the Hesea; depose her from her seat, conquer her land and hold\nit. Hear and obey.\"\n\n\"Mother, we hear and we will obey,\" answered Oros and Papave as with a\nsingle voice.\n\nShe waved her hand to show that this matter was finished; then after\nlong thought spoke again, addressing herself to the Khania.\n\n\"Atene, last night thou didst ask me a question--why thou dost love this\nman,\" and she pointed to Leo. \"To that the answer would be easy, for is\nhe not one who might well stir passion in the breast of a woman such as\nthou art? But thou didst say also that thine own heart and the wisdom of\nyonder magician, thy uncle, told thee that since thy soul first sprang\nto life thou hadst loved him, and didst adjure me by the Power to whom I\nmust give my account to draw the curtain from the past and let the truth\nbe known.\n\n\"Woman, the hour has come, and I obey thy summons--not because thou\ndost command but because it is my will. Of the beginning I can tell thee\nnothing, who am still human and no goddess. I know not why we three\nare wrapped in this coil of fate; I know not the destinies to which we\njourney up the ladder of a thousand lives, with grief and pain climbing\nthe endless stair of circumstance, or, if I know, I may not say.\nTherefore I take up the tale where my own memory gives me light.\"\n\nThe Hesea paused, and we saw her frame shake as though beneath some\nfearful inward effort of the will. \"Look now behind you,\" she cried,\nthrowing her arms wide.\n\nWe turned, and at first saw nothing save the great curtain of fire that\nrose from the abyss of the volcano, whereof, as I have told, the crest\nwas bent over by the wind like the crest of a breaking billow. But\npresently, as we watched, in the depths of this red veil, Nature's awful\nlamp-flame, a picture began to form as it forms in the seer's magic\ncrystal.\n\nBehold! a temple set amid sands and washed by a wide, palm-bordered\nriver, and across its pyloned court processions of priests, who pass\nto and fro with flaunting banners. The court empties; I could see the\nshadow of a falcon's wings that fled across its sunlit floor. A man clad\nin a priest's white robe, shaven-headed, and barefooted, enters through\nthe southern pylon gate and walks slowly towards a painted granite\nshrine, in which sits the image of a woman crowned with the double\ncrown of Egypt, surmounted by a lotus bloom, and holding in her hand the\nsacred sistrum. Now, as though he heard some sound, he halts and looks\ntowards us, and by the heaven above me, his face is the face of Leo\nVincey in his youth, the face too of that Kallikrates whose corpse we\nhad seen in the Caves of Kor!\n\n\"Look, look!\" gasped Leo, catching me by the arm; but I only nodded my\nhead in answer.\n\nThe man walks on again, and kneeling before the goddess in the shrine,\nembraces her feet and makes his prayer to her. Now the gates roll open,\nand a procession enters, headed by a veiled, noble-looking woman, who\nbears offerings, which she sets on the table before the shrine, bending\nher knee to the effigy of the goddess. Her oblations made, she turns\nto depart, and as she goes brushes her hand against the hand of the\nwatching priest, who hesitates, then follows her.\n\nWhen all her company have passed the gate she lingers alone in the\nshadow of the pylon, whispering to the priest and pointing to the river\nand the southern land beyond. He is disturbed; he reasons with her,\ntill, after one swift glance round, she lets drop her veil, bending\ntowards him and--their lips meet.\n\nAs time flies her face is turned towards us, and lo! it is the face of\nAtene, and amid her dusky hair the aura is reflected in jewelled gold,\nthe symbol of her royal rank. She looks at the shaven priest; she laughs\nas though in triumph; she points to the westering sun and to the river,\nand is gone.\n\nAye, and that laugh of long ago is echoed by Atene at our side, for she\nalso laughs in triumph and cries aloud to the old Shaman--\"True diviners\nwere my heart and thou! Behold how I won him in the past.\"\n\nThen, like ice on fire fell the cold voice of the Hesea.\n\n\"Be silent, woman, and see how thou didst lose him in the past.\"\n\nLo! the scene changes, and on a couch a lovely shape lies sleeping.\nShe dreams; she is afraid; and over her bends and whispers in her ear a\nshadowy form clad with the emblems of the goddess in the shrine, but now\nwearing upon her head the vulture cap. The woman wakes from her dream\nand looks round, and oh! the face is the face of Ayesha as it was seen\nof us when first she loosed her veil in the Caves of Kor.\n\nA sigh went up from us; we could not speak who thus fearfully once more\nbeheld her loveliness.\n\nAgain she sleeps, again the awful form bends over her and whispers. It\npoints, the distance opens. Lo! on a stormy sea a boat, and in the boat\ntwo wrapped in each other's arms, the priest and the royal woman, while\nover them like a Vengeance, raw-necked and ragged-pinioned, hovers a\nfollowing vulture, such a vulture as the goddess wore for headdress.\n\nThat picture fades from its burning frame, leaving the vast sheet\nof fire empty as the noonday sky. Then another forms. First a great,\nsmooth-walled cave carpeted with sand, a cave that we remembered well.\nThen lying on the sand, now no longer shaven, but golden-haired, the\ncorpse of the priest staring upwards with his glazed eyes, his white\nskin streaked with blood, and standing over him two women. One holds\na javelin in her hand and is naked except for her flowing hair, and\nbeautiful, beautiful beyond imagining. The other, wrapped in a dark\ncloak, beats the air with her hands, casting up her eyes as though to\ncall the curse of Heaven upon her rival's head. And those women are she\ninto whose sleeping ear the shadow had whispered, and the royal Egyptian\nwho had kissed her lover beneath the pylon gate.\n\nSlowly all the figures faded; it was as though the fire ate them up, for\nfirst they became thin and white as ashes; then vanished. The Hesea, who\nhad been leaning forward, sank backwards in her chair, as if weary with\nthe toil of her own magic.\n\nFor a while confused pictures flitted rapidly to and fro across the vast\nmirror of the flame, such as might be reflected from an intelligence\ncrowded with the memories of over two thousand years which it was too\nexhausted to separate and define.\n\nWild scenes, multitudes of people, great caves, and in them faces,\namongst others our own, starting up distorted and enormous, to grow\ntiny in an instant and depart; stark imaginations of Forms towering and\ndivine; of Things monstrous and inhuman; armies marching, illimitable\nbattle-fields, and corpses rolled in blood, and hovering over them the\nspirits of the slain.\n\nThese pictures died as the others had died, and the fire was blank\nagain.\n\nThen the Hesea spoke in a voice very faint at first, that by slow\ndegrees grew stronger.\n\n\"Is thy question answered, O Atene?\"\n\n\"I have seen strange sights, Mother, mighty limnings worthy of thy\nmagic, but how know I that they are more than vapours of thine own brain\ncast upon yonder fire to deceive and mock us?\"[*]\n\n     [*] Considered in the light of subsequent revelations,\n     vouchsafed to us by Ayesha herself, I am inclined to believe\n     that Atene's shrewd surmise was accurate, and that these\n     fearful pictures, although founded on events that had\n     happened in the past, were in the main \"vapours\" cast upon\n     the crater fire; visions raised in our minds to \"deceive and\n     mock us.\"--L. H. H.\n\n\"Listen then,\" said the Hesea, in her weary voice, \"to the\ninterpretation of the writing, and cease to trouble me with thy doubts.\nMany an age ago, but shortly after I began to live this last, long life\nof mine, Isis, the great goddess of Egypt, had her Holy House at Behbit,\nnear the Nile. It is a ruin now, and Isis has departed from Egypt,\nthough still under the Power that fashioned it and her: she rules the\nworld, for she is Nature's self. Of that shrine a certain man, a Greek,\nKallikrates by name, was chief priest, chosen for her service by the\nfavour of the goddess, vowed to her eternally and to her alone, by the\ndreadful oath that might not be broken without punishment as eternal.\n\n\"In the flame thou sawest that priest, and here at thy side he stands,\nre-born, to fulfil his destiny and ours.\n\n\"There lived also a daughter of Pharaoh's house, one Amenartas, who cast\neyes of love upon this Kallikrates, and, wrapping him in her spells--for\nthen as now she practised witcheries--caused him to break his oaths and\nfly with her, as thou sawest written in the flame. Thou, Atene, wast\nthat Amenartas.\n\n\"Lastly there lived a certain Arabian, named Ayesha, a wise and lovely\nwoman, who, in the emptiness of her heart, and the sorrow of much\nknowledge, had sought refuge in the service of the universal Mother,\nthinking there to win the true wisdom which ever fled from her. That\nAyesha, as thou sawest also, the goddess visited in a dream, bidding her\nto follow those faithless ones, and work Heaven's vengeance on them,\nand promising her in reward victory over death upon the earth and beauty\nsuch as had not been known in woman.\n\n\"She followed far; she awaited them where they wandered. Guided by a\nsage named Noot, one who from the beginning had been appointed to her\nservice and that of another--thou, O Holly, wast that man--she found\nthe essence in which to bathe is to outlive Generations, Faiths, and\nEmpires, saying--\"'I will slay these guilty ones. I will slay them\npresently, as I am commanded.'\n\n\"Yet Ayesha slew not, for now their sin was her sin, since she who had\nnever loved came to desire this man. She led them to the Place of Life,\npurposing there to clothe him and herself with immortality, and let the\nwoman die. But it was not so fated, for then the goddess smote. The\nlife was Ayesha's as had been sworn, but in its first hour, blinded with\njealous rage because he shrank from her unveiled glory to the mortal\nwoman at his side, this Ayesha brought him to his death, and alas! alas!\nleft herself undying.\n\n\"Thus did the angry goddess work woe upon her faithless ministers,\ngiving to the priest swift doom, to the priestess Ayesha, long remorse\nand misery, and to the royal Amenartas jealousy more bitter than life\nor death, and the fate of unending effort to win back that love which,\ndefying Heaven, she had dared to steal, but to be bereft thereof again.\n\n\"Lo! now the ages pass, and, at the time appointed, to that undying\nAyesha who, whilst awaiting his re-birth, from century to century\nmourned his loss, and did bitter penance for her sins, came back the\nman, her heart's desire. Then, whilst all went well for her and him,\nagain the goddess smote and robbed her of her reward. Before her lover's\nliving eyes, sunk in utter shame and misery, the beautiful became\nhideous, the undying seemed to die.\n\n\"Yet, O Kallikrates, I tell thee that she died not. Did not Ayesha swear\nto thee yonder in the Caves of Kor that she would come again? for even\nin that awful hour this comfort kissed her soul. Thereafter, Leo Vincey,\nwho art Killikrates, did not her spirit lead thee in thy sleep and stand\nwith thee upon this very pinnacle which should be thy beacon light to\nguide thee back to her? And didst thou not search these many years, not\nknowing that she companioned thy every step and strove to guard thee in\nevery danger, till at length in the permitted hour thou earnest back to\nher?\"\n\nShe paused, and looked towards Leo, as though awaiting his reply.\n\n\"Of the first part of the tale, except from the writing on the Sherd, I\nknow nothing, Lady,\" he said; \"of the rest I, or rather we, know that it\nis true. Yet I would ask a question, and I pray thee of thy charity let\nthy answer be swift and short. Thou sayest that in the permitted hour\nI came back to Ayesha. Where then is Ayesha? Art thou Ayesha? And if so\nwhy is thy voice changed? Why art thou less in stature? Oh! in the name\nof whatever god thou dost worship, tell me art thou Ayesha?\"\n\n\"_I am Ayesha_\" she answered solemnly, \"that very Ayesha to whom thou\ndidst pledge thyself eternally.\"\n\n\"She lies, she lies,\" broke in Atene. \"I tell thee, husband--for such\nwith her own lips she declares thou art to me--that yonder woman who\nsays that she parted from thee young and beautiful, less than twenty\nyears ago, is none other than the aged priestess who for a century at\nleast has borne rule in these halls of Hes. Let her deny it if she can.\"\n\n\"Oros,\" said the Mother, \"tell thou the tale of the death of that\npriestess of whom the Khania speaks.\"\n\nThe priest bowed, and in his usual calm voice, as though he were\nnarrating some event of every day, said mechanically, and in a fashion\nthat carried no conviction to my mind--\"Eighteen years ago, on the\nfourth night of the first month of the winter in the year 2333 of the\nfounding of the worship of Hes on this Mountain, the priestess of whom\nthe Khania Atene speaks, died of old age in my presence in the hundred\nand eighth year of her rule. Three hours later we went to lift her from\nthe throne on which she died, to prepare her corpse for burial in this\nfire, according to the ancient custom. Lo! a miracle, for she lived\nagain, the same, yet very changed.\n\n\"Thinking this a work of evil magic, the Priests and Priestesses of the\nCollege rejected her, and would have driven her from the throne. Thereon\nthe Mountain blazed and thundered, the light from the fiery pillars\ndied, and great terror fell upon the souls of men. Then from the deep\ndarkness above the altar where stands the statue of the Mother of Men,\nthe voice of the living goddess spoke, saying--\"'Accept ye her whom\nI have set to rule over you, that my judgments and my purposes may be\nfulfilled.'\n\n\"The Voice ceased, the fiery torches burnt again, and we bowed the knee\nto the new Hesea, and named her Mother in the ears of all. That is the\ntale to which hundreds can bear witness.\"\n\n\"Thou hearest, Atene,\" said the Hesea. \"Dost thou still doubt?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" answered the Khania, \"for I hold that Oros also lies, or if he\nlies not, then he dreams, or perchance that voice he heard was thine\nown. Now if thou art this undying woman, this Ayesha, let proof be\nmade of it to these two men who knew thee in the past. Tear away those\nwrappings that guard thy loveliness thus jealously. Let thy shape\ndivine, thy beauty incomparable, shine out upon our dazzled sight.\nSurely thy lover will not forget such charms; surely he will know thee,\nand bow the knee, saying, 'This is my Immortal, and no other woman.'\n\n\"Then, and not till then, will I believe that thou art even what thou\ndeclarest thyself to be, an evil spirit, who bought undying life with\nmurder and used thy demon loveliness to bewitch the souls of men.\"\n\nNow the Hesea on the throne seemed to be much troubled, for she rocked\nherself to and fro, and wrung her white-draped hands.\n\n\"Kallikrates,\" she said in a voice that sounded like a moan, \"is this\nthy will? For if it be, know that I must obey. Yet I pray thee command\nit not, for the time is not yet come; the promise unbreakable is not yet\nfulfilled. _I am somewhat changed_, Kallikrates, since I kissed thee on\nthe brow and named thee mine, yonder in the Caves of Kor.\"\n\nLeo looked about him desperately, till his eyes fell upon the mocking\nface of Atene, who cried--\"Bid her unveil, my lord. I swear to thee I'll\nnot be jealous.\"\n\nAt that taunt he took fire.\n\n\"Aye,\" he said, \"I bid her unveil, that I may learn the best or worst,\nwho otherwise must die of this suspense. Howsoever changed, if she be\nAyesha I shall know her, and if she be Ayesha, I shall love her.\"\n\n\"Bold words, Kallikrates,\" answered the Hesea; \"yet from my very heart I\nthank thee for them: those sweet words of trust and faithfulness to thou\nknowest not what. Learn now the truth, for I may keep naught back from\nthee. When I unveil it is decreed that thou must make thy choice for\nthe last time on this earth between yonder woman, my rival from the\nbeginning, and that Ayesha to whom thou art sworn. Thou canst reject me\nif thou wilt, and no ill shall come to thee, but many a blessing, as\nmen reckon them--power and wealth and love. Only then thou must tear my\nmemory from thy heart, for then I leave thee to follow thy fate alone,\ntill at the last the purpose of these deeds and sufferings is made\nclear.\n\n\"Be warned. No light ordeal lies before thee. Be warned. I can promise\nthee naught save such love as woman never gave to man, love that\nperchance--I know not--must yet remain unsatisfied upon the earth.\"\n\nThen she turned to me and said:\n\n\"Oh! thou, Holly, thou true friend, thou guardian from of old, thou,\nnext to him most beloved by me, to thy clear and innocent spirit\nperchance wisdom may be given that is denied to us, the little children\nwhom thine arms protect. Counsel thou him, my Holly, with the counsel\nthat is given thee, and I will obey thy words and his, and, whatever\nbefalls, will bless thee from my soul. Aye, and should he cast me off,\nthen in the Land beyond the lands, in the Star appointed, where all\nearthly passions fade, together will we dwell eternally in a friendship\nglorious, thou and I alone.\n\n\"For _thou_ wilt not reject; thy steel, forged in the furnace of pure\ntruth and power, shall not lose its temper in these small fires of\ntemptation and become a rusted chain to bind thee to another woman's\nbreast--until it canker to her heart and thine.\"\n\n\"Ayesha, I thank thee for thy words,\" I answered simply, \"and by them\nand that promise of thine, I, thy poor friend--for more I never thought\nto be--am a thousandfold repaid for many sufferings. This I will add,\nthat for my part I know that thou art She whom we have lost, since,\nwhatever the lips that speak them, those thoughts and words are Ayesha's\nand hers alone.\"\n\nThus I spoke, not knowing what else to say, for I was filled with a\ngreat joy, a calm and ineffable satisfaction, which broke thus feebly\nfrom my heart. For now I knew that I was dear to Ayesha as I had always\nbeen dear to Leo; the closest of friends, from whom she never would be\nparted. What more could I desire?\n\nWe fell back; we spoke together, whilst they watched us silently. What\nwe said I do not quite remember, but the end of it was that, as the\nHesea had done, Leo bade me judge and choose. Then into my mind there\ncame a clear command, from my own conscience or otherwhere, who can\nsay? This was the command, that I should bid her to unveil, and let fate\ndeclare its purposes.\n\n\"Decide,\" said Leo, \"I cannot bear much more. Like that woman, whoever\nshe may be, whatever happens, I will not blame you, Horace.\"\n\n\"Good,\" I answered, \"I have decided,\" and, stepping forward, I said: \"We\nhave taken counsel, Hes, and it is our will, who would learn the truth\nand be at rest, that thou shouldst unveil before us, here and now.\"\n\n\"I hear and obey,\" the Priestess answered, in a voice like to that of a\ndying woman, \"only, I beseech you both, be pitiful to me, spare me your\nmockeries; add not the coals of your hate and scorn to the fires of a\nsoul in hell, for whate'er I am, I became it for thy sake, Kallikrates.\nYet, yet I also am athirst for knowledge; for though I know all wisdom,\nalthough I wield much power, one thing remains to me to learn--what is\nthe worth of the love of man, and if, indeed, it can live beyond the\nhorrors of the grave?\"\n\nThen, rising slowly, the Hesea walked, or rather tottered to the\nunroofed open space in front of the rock chamber, and stood there quite\nnear to the brink of the flaming gulf beneath.\n\n\"Come hither, Papave, and loose these veils,\" she cried in a shrill,\nthin voice.\n\nPapave advanced, and with a look of awe upon her handsome face began the\ntask. She was not a tall woman, yet as she bent over her I noted that\nshe seemed to tower above her mistress, the Hesea.\n\nThe outer veils fell revealing more within. These fell also, and now\nbefore us stood the mummy-like shape, although it seemed to be of less\nstature, of that strange being who had met us in the Place of Bones. So\nit would seem that our mysterious guide and the high priestess Hes were\nthe same.\n\nLook! Length by length the wrappings sank from her. Would they\nnever end? How small grew the frame within? She was very short now,\nunnaturally short for a full-grown woman, and oh! I grew sick at heart.\nThe last bandages uncoiled themselves like shavings from a stick;\ntwo wrinkled hands appeared, if hands they could be called. Then the\nfeet--once I had seen such on the mummy of a princess of Egypt, and even\nnow by some fantastic play of the mind, I remembered that on her coffin\nthis princess was named \"The Beautiful.\"\n\nEverything was gone now, except a shift and a last inner veil about the\nhead. Hes waved back the priestess Papave, who fell half fainting to\nthe ground and lay there covering her eyes with her hand. Then uttering\nsomething like a scream she gripped this veil in her thin talons, tore\nit away, and with a gesture of uttermost despair, turned and faced us.\n\nOh! she was--nay, I will not describe her. I knew her at once, for thus\nhad I seen her last before the Fire of Life, and, strangely enough,\nthrough the mask of unutterable age, through that cloak of humanity's\nlast decay, still shone some resemblance to the glorious and superhuman\nAyesha: the shape of the face, the air of defiant pride that for an\ninstant bore her up--I know not what.\n\nYes, there she stood, and the fierce light of the heartless fires beat\nupon her, revealing every shame.\n\nThere was a dreadful silence. I saw Leo's lips turn white and his knees\nbegin to give; but by some effort he recovered himself, and stayed still\nand upright like a dead man held by a wire. Also I saw Atene--and this\nis to her credit--turn her head away. She had desired to see her rival\nhumiliated, but that horrible sight shocked her; some sense of their\ncommon womanhood for the moment touched her pity. Only Simbri, who, I\nthink, knew what to expect, and Oros remained quite unmoved; indeed, in\nthat ghastly silence the latter spoke, and ever afterwards I loved him\nfor his words.\n\n\"What of the vile vessel, rotted in the grave of time? What of the flesh\nthat perishes?\" he said. \"Look through the ruined lamp to the eternal\nlight which burns within. Look through its covering carrion to the\ninextinguishable soul.\"\n\nMy heart applauded these noble sentiments. I was of one mind with Oros,\nbut oh, Heaven! I felt that my brain was going, and I wished that it\nwould go, so that I might hear and see no more.\n\nThat look which gathered on Ayesha's mummy face? At first there had been\na little hope, but the hope died, and anguish, anguish, _anguish_ took\nits place.\n\nSomething must be done, this could not endure. My lips clave together,\nno word would come; my feet refused to move.\n\nI began to contemplate the scenery. How wonderful were that sheet of\nflame, and the ripples which ran up and down its height. How awesome its\nbillowy crest. It would be warm lying in yonder red gulf below with the\ndead Rassen, but oh! I wished that I shared his bed and had finished\nwith these agonies.\n\nThank Heaven, Atene was speaking. She had stepped to the side of the\nnaked-headed Thing, and stood by it in all the pride of her rich beauty\nand perfect womanhood.\n\n\"Leo Vincey, or Kallikrates,\" said Atene, \"take which name thou wilt;\nthou thinkest ill of me perhaps, but know that at least I scorn to mock\na rival in her mortal shame. She told us a wild tale but now, a tale\ntrue or false, but more false than true, I think, of how I robbed\na goddess of a votary, and of how that goddess--Ayesha's self\nperchance--was avenged upon me for the crime of yielding to the man I\nloved. Well, let goddesses--if such indeed there be--take their way and\nwork their will upon the helpless, and I, a mortal, will take mine\nuntil the clutch of doom closes round my throat and chokes out life and\nmemory, and I too am a goddess--or a clod.\n\n\"Meanwhile, thou man, I shame not to say it before all these witnesses,\nI love thee, and it seems that this--this woman or goddess--loves thee\nalso, and she has told us that now, _now_ thou must choose between us\nonce and for ever. She has told us too that if I sinned against Isis,\nwhose minister be it remembered she declares herself, herself she sinned\nyet more. For she would have taken thee both from a heavenly mistress\nand from an earthly bride, and yet snatch that guerdon of immortality\nwhich is hers to-day. Therefore if I am evil, she is worse, nor does the\nflame that burns within the casket whereof Oros spoke shine so very pure\nand bright.\n\n\"Choose thou then Leo Vincey, and let there be an end. I vaunt not\nmyself; thou knowest what I have been and seest what I am. Yet I can\ngive thee love and happiness and, mayhap, children to follow after thee,\nand with them some place and power. What yonder witch can give thee thou\ncanst guess. Tales of the past, pictures on the flame, wise maxims and\nhoneyed words, and after thou art dead once more, promises perhaps, of\njoy to come when that terrible goddess whom she serves so closely shall\nbe appeased. I have spoken. Yet I will add a word:\n\n\"O thou for whom, if the Hesea's tale be true, I did once lay down my\nroyal rank and dare the dangers of an unsailed sea; O thou whom in ages\ngone I would have sheltered with my frail body from the sorceries of\nthis cold, self-seeking witch; O thou whom but a little while ago at my\nown life's risk I drew from death in yonder river, choose, choose!\"\n\nTo all this speech, so moderate yet so cruel, so well-reasoned and\nyet so false, because of its glosses and omissions, the huddled Ayesha\nseemed to listen with a fierce intentness. Yet she made no answer, not\na single word, not a sign even; she who had said her say and scorned to\nplead her part.\n\nI looked at Leo's ashen face. He leaned towards Atene, drawn perhaps by\nthe passion shining in her beauteous eyes, then of a sudden straightened\nhimself, shook his head and sighed. The colour flamed to his brow, and\nhis eyes grew almost happy.\n\n\"After all,\" he said, thinking aloud rather than speaking, \"I have to do\nnot with unknowable pasts or with mystic futures, but with the things\nof my own life. Ayesha waited for me through two thousand years; Atene\ncould marry a man she hated for power's sake, and then could poison him,\nas perhaps she would poison me when I wearied her. I know not what oaths\nI swore to Amenartas, if such a woman lived. I remember the oaths I\nswore to Ayesha. If I shrink from her now, why then my life is a lie and\nmy belief a fraud; then love will not endure the touch of age and never\ncan survive the grave.\n\n\"Nay, remembering what Ayesha was I take her as she is, in faith and\nhope of what she shall be. At least love is immortal and if it must, why\nlet it feed on memory alone till death sets free the soul.\"\n\nThen stepping to where stood the dreadful, shrivelled form, Leo knelt\ndown before it and kissed her on the brow.\n\nYes, he kissed the trembling horror of that wrinkled head, and I think\nit was one of the greatest, bravest acts ever done by man.\n\n\"Thou hast chosen,\" said Atene in a cold voice, \"and I tell thee, Leo\nVincey, that the manner of thy choice makes me mourn my loss the more.\nTake now thy--thy bride and let me hence.\"\n\nBut Ayesha still said no word and made no sign, till presently she sank\nupon her bony knees and began to pray aloud. These were the words of\nher prayer, as I heard them, though the exact Power to which it was\naddressed is not very easy to determine, as I never discovered who or\nwhat it was that she worshipped in her heart--\"O Thou minister of the\nalmighty Will, thou sharp sword in the hand of Doom, thou inevitable Law\nthat art named Nature; thou who wast crowned as Isis of the Egyptians,\nbut art the goddess of all climes and ages; thou that leadest the man\nto the maid, and layest the infant on his mother's breast, that bringest\nour dust to its kindred dust, that givest life to death, and into the\ndark of death breathest the light of life again; thou who causest the\nabundant earth to bear, whose smile is Spring, whose laugh is the ripple\nof the sea, whose noontide rest is drowsy Summer, and whose sleep is\nWinter's night, hear thou the supplication of thy chosen child and\nminister:\n\n\"Of old thou gavest me thine own strength with deathless days, and\nbeauty above every daughter of this Star. But I sinned against thee\nsore, and for my sin I paid in endless centuries of solitude, in the\nvileness that makes me loathsome to my lover's eyes, and for its diadem\nof perfect power sets upon my brow this crown of naked mockery. Yet in\nthy breath, the swift essence that brought me light, that brought me\ngloom, thou didst vow to me that I who cannot die should once more pluck\nthe lost flower of my immortal loveliness from this foul slime of shame.\n\n\"Therefore, merciful Mother that bore me, to thee I make my prayer.\nOh, let his true love atone my sin; or, if it may not be, then give me\ndeath, the last and most blessed of thy boons!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE CHANGE\n\nShe ceased, and there was a long, long silence. Leo and I looked at\neach other in dismay. We had hoped against hope that this beautiful\nand piteous prayer, addressed apparently to the great, dumb spirit of\nNature, would be answered. That meant a miracle, but what of it? The\nprolongation of the life of Ayesha was a miracle, though it is true that\nsome humble reptiles are said to live as long as she had done.\n\nThe transference of her spirit from the Caves of Kor to this temple was\na miracle, that is, to our western minds, though the dwellers in these\nparts of Central Asia would not hold it so. That she should re-appear\nwith the same hideous body was a miracle. But was it the same body? Was\nit not the body of the last Hesea? One very ancient woman is much like\nanother, and eighteen years of the working of the soul or identity\nwithin might well wear away their trivial differences and give to the\nborrowed form some resemblance to that which it had left.\n\nAt least the figures on that mirror of the flame were a miracle. Nay,\nwhy so? A hundred clairvoyants in a hundred cities can produce or see\ntheir like in water and in crystal, the difference being only one\nof size. They were but reflections of scenes familiar to the mind of\nAyesha, or perhaps not so much as that. Perhaps they were only phantasms\ncalled up in _our_ minds by her mesmeric force.\n\nNay, none of these things were true miracles, since all, however\nstrange, might be capable of explanation. What right then had we to\nexpect a marvel now?\n\nSuch thoughts as these rose in our minds as the endless minutes were\nborn and died and--nothing happened.\n\nYes, at last one thing did happen. The light from the sheet of flame\ndied gradually away as the flame itself sank downwards into the abysses\nof the pit. But about this in itself there was nothing wonderful, for\nas we had seen with our own eyes from afar this fire varied much, and\nindeed it was customary for it to die down at the approach of dawn,\nwhich now drew very near.\n\nStill that onward-creeping darkness added to the terrors of the scene.\nBy the last rays of the lurid light we saw Ayesha rise and advance some\nfew paces to that little tongue of rock at the edge of the pit off\nwhich the body of Rassen had been hurled; saw her standing on it, also,\nlooking like some black, misshapen imp against the smoky glow which\nstill rose from the depths beneath.\n\nLeo would have gone forward to her, for he believed that she was about\nto hurl herself to doom, which indeed I thought was her design. But the\npriest Oros, and the priestess Papave, obeying, I suppose, some secret\ncommand that reached them I know not how, sprang to him and seizing his\narms, held him back. Then it became quite dark, and through the darkness\nwe could hear Ayesha chanting a dirge-like hymn in some secret, holy\ntongue which was unknown to us.\n\nA great flake of fire floated through the gloom, rocking to and fro like\nsome vast bird upon its pinions. We had seen many such that night, torn\nby the gale from the crest of the blazing curtain as I have described.\nBut--but--\"Horace,\" whispered Leo through his chattering teeth, \"that\nflame is coming up _against the wind!_\"\n\n\"Perhaps the wind has changed,\" I answered, though I knew well that it\nhad not; that it blew stronger than ever from the south.\n\nNearer and nearer sailed the rocking flame, two enormous wings was the\nshape of it, with something dark between them. It reached the little\npromontory. The wings appeared to fold themselves about the dwarfed\nfigure that stood thereon--illuminating it for a moment. Then the light\nwent out of them and they vanished--everything vanished.\n\nA while passed, it may have been one minute or ten, when suddenly the\npriestess Papave, in obedience to some summons which we could not hear,\ncrept by me. I knew that it was she because her woman's garments touched\nme as she went. Another space of silence and of deep darkness, during\nwhich I heard Papave return, breathing in short, sobbing gasps like one\nwho is very frightened.\n\nAh! I thought, Ayesha has cast herself into the pit. The tragedy is\nfinished!\n\nThen it was that the wondrous music came. Of course it _may_ have been\nonly the sound of priests chanting beyond us, but I do not think so,\nsince its quality was quite different to any that I heard in the temple\nbefore or afterwards: to any indeed that ever I heard upon the earth.\n\nI cannot describe it, but it was awful to listen to, yet most\nentrancing. From the black, smoke-veiled pit where the fire had burned\nit welled and echoed--now a single heavenly voice, now a sweet chorus,\nand now an air-shaking thunder as of a hundred organs played to time.\n\nThat diverse and majestic harmony seemed to include, to express\nevery human emotion, and I have often thought since then that in its\nall-embracing scope and range, this, the song or paean of her re-birth\nwas symbolical of the infinite variety of Ayesha's spirit. Yet like that\nspirit it had its master notes; power, passion, suffering, mystery and\nloveliness. Also there could be no doubt as to the general significance\nof the chant by whomsoever it was sung. It was the changeful story of a\nmighty soul; it was worship, worship, worship of a queen divine!\n\nLike slow clouds of incense fading to the bannered roof of some high\nchoir, the bursts of unearthly melodies grew faint; in the far distance\nof the hollow pit they wailed themselves away.\n\nLook! from the east a single ray of upward-springing light.\n\n\"Behold the dawn,\" said the quiet voice of Oros.\n\nThat ray pierced the heavens above our heads, a very sword of flame. It\nsank downwards, swiftly. Suddenly it fell, not upon us, for as yet\nthe rocky walls of our chamber warded it away, but on to the little\npromontory at its edge.\n\nOh! and there--a Glory covered with a single garment--stood a shape\ncelestial. It seemed to be asleep, since the eyes were shut. Or was it\ndead, for at first that face was a face of death? Look, the sunlight\nplayed upon her, shining through the thin veil, the dark eyes opened\nlike the eyes of a wondering child; the blood of life flowed up the\nivory bosom into the pallid cheeks; the raiment of black and curling\ntresses wavered in the wind; the head of the jewelled snake that held\nthem sparkled beneath her breast.\n\nWas it an illusion, or was this Ayesha as she had been when she entered\nthe rolling flame in the caverns of Kor? Our knees gave way beneath us,\nand down, our arms about each other's necks, Leo and I sank till we\nlay upon the ground. Then a voice sweeter than honey, softer than the\nwhisper of a twilight breeze among the reeds, spoke near to us, and\nthese were the words it said--\"_Come hither to me, Kallikrates, who\nwould pay thee back that redeeming kiss of faith and love thou gavest me\nbut now!_\"\n\nLeo struggled to his feet. Like a drunken man he staggered to where\nAyesha stood, then overcome, sank before her on his knees.\n\n\"Arise,\" she said, \"it is I who should kneel to thee,\" and she stretched\nout her hand to raise him, whispering in his ear the while.\n\nStill he would not, or could not rise, so very slowly she bent over him\nand touched him with her lips upon the brow. Next she beckoned to me. I\ncame and would have knelt also, but she suffered it not.\n\n\"Nay,\" she said, in her rich, remembered voice, \"thou art no suitor; it\nshall not be. Of lovers and worshippers henceforth as before, I can find\na plenty if I will, or even if I will it not. But where shall I find\nanother friend like to thee, O Holly, whom thus I greet?\" and leaning\ntowards me, with her lips she touched me also on the brow--just touched\nme, and no more.\n\nFragrant was Ayesha's breath as roses, the odour of roses clung to her\nlovely hair; her sweet body gleamed like some white sea-pearl; a faint\nbut palpable radiance crowned her head; no sculptor ever fashioned such\na marvel as the arm with which she held her veil about her; no stars in\nheaven ever shone more purely bright than did her calm, entranced eyes.\n\nYet it is true, even with her lips upon me, all I felt for her was a\nlove divine into which no human passion entered. Once, I acknowledge to\nmy shame, it was otherwise, but I am an old man now and have done with\nsuch frailties. Moreover, had not Ayesha named me Guardian, Protector,\nFriend, and sworn to me that with her and Leo I should ever dwell where\nall earthly passions fail. I repeat: what more could I desire?\n\nTaking Leo by the hand Ayesha returned with him into the shelter of the\nrock-hewn chamber and when she entered its shadows, shivered a little as\nthough with cold. I rejoiced at this I remember, for it seemed to show\nme that she still was human, divine as she might appear. Here her priest\nand priestess prostrated themselves before her new-born splendour, but\nshe motioned to them to rise, laying a hand upon the head of each as\nthough in blessing. \"I am cold,\" she said, \"give me my mantle,\" and\nPapave threw the purple-broidered garment upon her shoulders, whence now\nit hung royally, like a coronation robe.\n\n\"Nay,\" she went on, \"it is not this long-lost shape of mine, which in\nhis kiss my lord gave back to me, that shivers in the icy wind, it is my\nspirit's self bared to the bitter breath of Destiny. O my love, my\nlove, offended Powers are not easily appeased, even when they appear to\npardon, and though I shall no more be made a mockery in thy sight, how\nlong is given us together upon the world I know not; but a little hour\nperchance. Well, ere we pass otherwhere, we will make it glorious,\ndrinking as deeply of the cup of joy as we have drunk of those of\nsorrows and of shame. This place is hateful to me, for here I have\nsuffered more than ever woman did on earth or phantom in the deepest\nhell. It is hateful, it is ill-omened. I pray that never again may I\nbehold it.\n\n\"Say, what is it passes in thy mind, magician?\" and of a sudden she\nturned fiercely upon the Shaman Simbri who stood near, his arms crossed\nupon his breast.\n\n\"Only, thou Beautiful,\" he answered, \"a dim shadow of things to come. I\nhave what thou dost lack with all thy wisdom, the gift of foresight, and\nhere I see a dead man lying----\"\n\n\"Another word,\" she broke in with fury born of some dark fear, \"and thou\nshalt be that man. Fool, put me not in mind that now I have strength\nagain to rid me of the ancient foes I hate, lest I should use a sword\nthou thrustest to my hand,\" and her eyes that had been so calm and\nhappy, blazed upon him like fire.\n\nThe old wizard felt their fearsome might and shrank from it till the\nwall stayed him.\n\n\"Great One! now as ever I salute thee. Yes, now as at the first\nbeginning whereof we know alone,\" he stammered. \"I had no more to say;\nthe face of that dead man was not revealed to me. I saw only that some\ncrowned Khan of Kaloon to be shall lie here, as he whom the flame has\ntaken lay an hour ago.\"\n\n\"Doubtless many a Khan of Kaloon will lie here,\" she answered coldly.\n\"Fear not, Shaman, my wrath is past, yet be wise, mine enemy, and\nprophesy no more evil to the great. Come, let us hence.\"\n\nSo, still led by Leo, she passed from that chamber and stood presently\nupon the apex of the soaring pillar. The sun was up now, flooding the\nMountain flanks, the plains of Kaloon far beneath and the distant,\nmisty peaks with a sheen of gold. Ayesha stood considering the mighty\nprospect, then addressing Leo, she said--\"The world is very fair; I give\nit all to thee.\"\n\nNow Atene spoke for the first time.\n\n\"Dost thou mean Hes--if thou art still the Hesea and not a demon\narisen from the Pit--that thou offerest my territories to this man as a\nlove-gift? If so, I tell thee that first thou must conquer them.\"\n\n\"Ungentle are thy words and mien,\" answered Ayesha, \"yet I forgive them\nboth, for I also can scorn to mock a rival in my hour of victory. When\nthou wast the fairer, thou didst proffer him these very lands, but say,\nwho is the fairer now? Look at us, all of you, and judge,\" and she stood\nby Atene and smiled.\n\nThe Khania was a lovely woman. Never to my knowledge have I seen one\nlovelier, but oh! how coarse and poor she showed beside the wild,\nethereal beauty of Ayesha born again. For that beauty was not altogether\nhuman, far less so indeed than it had been in the Caves of Kor; now it\nwas the beauty of a spirit.\n\nThe little light that always shone upon Ayesha's brow; the wide-set,\nmaddening eyes which were filled sometimes with the fire of the stars\nand sometimes with the blue darkness of the heavens wherein they float;\nthe curved lips, so wistful yet so proud; the tresses fine as glossy\nsilk that still spread and rippled as though with a separate life; the\ngeneral air, not so much of majesty as of some secret power hard to\nbe restrained, which strove in that delicate body and proclaimed its\npresence to the most careless; that flame of the soul within whereof\nOros had spoken, shining now through no \"vile vessel,\" but in a vase\nof alabaster and of pearl--none of these things and qualities were\naltogether human. I felt it and was afraid, and Atene felt it also, for\nshe answered--\"I am but a woman. What thou art, thou knowest best. Still\na taper cannot shine midst yonder fires or a glow-worm against a fallen\nstar; nor can my mortal flesh compare with the glory thou hast earned\nfrom hell in payment for thy gifts and homage to the lord of ill. Yet as\nwoman I am thy equal, and as spirit I shall be thy mistress, when robbed\nof these borrowed beauties thou, Ayesha, standest naked and ashamed\nbefore the Judge of all whom thou hast deserted and defied; yes, as thou\nstoodest but now upon yonder brink above the burning pit where thou yet\nshalt wander wailing thy lost love. For this I know, mine enemy, that\n_man and spirit cannot mate_,\" and Atene ceased, choking in her bitter\nrage and jealousy.\n\nNow watching Ayesha, I saw her wince a little beneath these evil-omened\nwords, saw also a tinge of grey touch the carmine of her lips and her\ndeep eyes grow dark and troubled. But in a moment her fears had gone and\nshe was asking in a voice that rang clear as silver bells--\"Why ravest\nthou, Atene, like some short-lived summer torrent against the barrier\nof a seamless cliff? Dost think, poor creature of an hour, to sweep away\nthe rock of my eternal strength with foam and bursting bubbles? Have\ndone and listen. I do not seek thy petty rule, who, if I will it, can\ntake the empire of the world. Yet learn, thou holdest it of my hand.\nMore--I purpose soon to visit thee in thy city--choose thou if it shall\nbe in peace or war! Therefore, Khania, purge thy court and amend thy\nlaws, that when I come I may find contentment in the land which now it\nlacks, and confirm thee in thy government. My counsel to thee also is\nthat thou choose some worthy man to husband, let him be whom thou wilt,\nif only he is just and upright and one upon whom thou mayest rest,\nneeding wise guidance as thou dost, Atene. Come, now, my guests, let\nus hence,\" and she walked past the Khania, stepping fearlessly upon the\nvery edge of the wind-swept, rounded peak.\n\nIn a second the attempt had been made and failed, so quickly indeed that\nit was not until Leo and I compared our impressions afterwards that we\ncould be sure of what had happened. As Ayesha passed her, the maddened\nKhania drew a hidden dagger and struck with all her force at her rival's\nback. I saw the knife vanish to the hilt in her body, as I thought, but\nthis cannot have been so since it fell to the ground, and she who should\nhave been dead, took no hurt at all.\n\nFeeling that she had failed, with a movement like the sudden lurch of\na ship, Atene thrust at Ayesha, proposing to hurl her to destruction\nin the depths beneath. Lo! her outstretched arms went past her although\nAyesha never seemed to stir. Yes it was Atene who would have fallen,\nAtene who already fell, had not Ayesha put out her hand and caught\nher by the wrist, bearing all her backward-swaying weight as easily as\nthough she were but an infant, and without effort drawing her to safety.\n\n\"Foolish woman!\" she said in pitying tones. \"Wast thou so vexed that\nthou wouldst strip thyself of the pleasant shape which heaven has\ngiven thee? Surely this is madness, Atene, for how knowest thou in what\nlikeness thou mightest be sent to tread the earth again? As no queen\nperhaps, but as a peasant's child, deformed, unsightly; for such reward,\nit is said, is given to those that achieve self-murder. Or even, as many\nthink, shaped like a beast--a snake, a cat, a tigress! Why, see,\" and\nshe picked the dagger from the ground and cast it into the air, \"that\npoint was poisoned. Had it but pricked thee now!\" and she smiled at her\nand shook her head.\n\nBut Atene could bear no more of this mockery, more venomed than her own\nsteel.\n\n\"Thou art not mortal,\" she wailed. \"How can I prevail against thee? To\nHeaven I leave thy punishment,\" and there upon the rocky peak Atene sank\ndown and wept.\n\nLeo stood nearest to her, and the sight of this royal woman in her\nmisery proved too much for him to bear. Stepping to her side he stooped\nand lifted her to her feet, muttering some kind words. For a moment she\nrested on his arm, then shook herself free of him and took the proffered\nhand of her old uncle Simbri.\n\n\"I see,\" said Ayesha, \"that as ever, thou art courteous, my lord Leo,\nbut it is best that her own servant should take charge of her, for--she\nmay hide more daggers. Come, the day grows, and surely we need rest.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nTHE BETROTHAL\n\nTogether we descended the multitudinous steps and passed the endless,\nrock-hewn passages till we came to the door of the dwelling of the\nhigh-priestess and were led through it into a hall beyond. Here Ayesha\nparted from us saying that she was outworn, as indeed she seemed to be\nwith an utter weariness, not of the body, but of the spirit. For her\ndelicate form drooped like a rain-laden lily, her eyes grew dim as those\nof a person in a trance, and her voice came in a soft, sweet whisper,\nthe voice of one speaking in her sleep.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" she said to us. \"Oros will guard you both, and lead you to\nme at the appointed time. Rest you well.\"\n\nSo she went and the priest led us into a beautiful apartment that opened\non to a sheltered garden. So overcome were we also by all that we had\nendured and seen, that we could scarcely speak, much less discuss these\nmarvellous events.\n\n\"My brain swims,\" said Leo to Oros, \"I desire to sleep.\"\n\nHe bowed and conducted us to a chamber where were beds, and on these we\nflung ourselves down and slept, dreamlessly, like little children.\n\nWhen we awoke it was afternoon. We rose and bathed, then saying that\nwe wished to be alone, went together into the garden where even at\nthis altitude, now, at the end of August, the air was still mild and\npleasant. Behind a rock by a bed of campanulas and other mountain\nflowers and ferns, was a bench near to the banks of a little stream, on\nwhich we seated ourselves.\n\n\"What have you to say, Horace?\" asked Leo laying his hand upon my arm.\n\n\"Say?\" I answered. \"That things have come about most marvellously; that\nwe have dreamed aright and laboured not in vain; that you are the most\nfortunate of men and should be the most happy.\"\n\nHe looked at me somewhat strangely, and answered--\"Yes, of course;\nshe is lovely, is she not--but,\" and his voice dropped to its lowest\nwhisper, \"I wish, Horace, that Ayesha were a little more human, even as\nhuman as she was in the Caves of Kor. I don't think she is quite flesh\nand blood, I felt it when she kissed me--if you can call it a kiss--for\nshe barely touched my hair. Indeed how can she be who changed thus in an\nhour? Flesh and blood are not born of flame, Horace.\"\n\n\"Are you sure that she was so born?\" I asked. \"Like the visions on the\nfire, may not that hideous shape have been but an illusion of our minds?\nMay she not be still the same Ayesha whom we knew in Kor, not re-born,\nbut wafted hither by some mysterious agency?\"\n\n\"Perhaps. Horace, we do not know--I think that we shall never know.\nBut I admit that to me the thing is terrifying. I am drawn to her by\nan infinite attraction, her eyes set my blood on fire, the touch of her\nhand is as that of a wand of madness laid upon my brain. And yet between\nus there is some wall, invisible, still present. Or perhaps it is only\nfancy. But, Horace, I think that she is afraid of Atene. Why, in the\nold days the Khania would have been dead and forgotten in an hour--you\nremember Ustane?\"\n\n\"Perhaps she may have grown more gentle, Leo, who, like ourselves, has\nlearned hard lessons.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered, \"I hope that is so. At any rate she has grown more\ndivine--only, Horace, what kind of a husband shall I be for that bright\nbeing, if ever I get so far?\"\n\n\"Why should you not get so far?\" I asked angrily, for his words jarred\nupon my tense nerves.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he answered, \"but on general principles do you think\nthat such fortune will be allowed to a man? Also, what did Atene mean\nwhen she said that man and spirit cannot mate--and--other things?\"\n\n\"She meant that she _hoped_ they could not, I imagine, and, Leo, it is\nuseless to trouble yourself with forebodings that are more fitted to my\nyears than yours, and probably are based on nothing. Be a philosopher,\nLeo. You have striven by wonderful ways such as are unknown in the\nhistory of the world; you have attained. Take the goods the gods provide\nyou--the glory, the love and the power--and let the future look to\nitself.\"\n\nBefore he could answer Oros appeared from round the rock, and, bowing\nwith more than his usual humility to Leo, said that the Hesea desired\nour presence at a service in the Sanctuary. Rejoiced at the prospect\nof seeing her again before he had hoped to do so, Leo sprang up and we\naccompanied him back to our apartment.\n\nHere priests were waiting, who, somewhat against his will, trimmed his\nhair and beard, and would have done the same for me had I not refused\ntheir offices. Then they placed gold-embroidered sandals on our feet and\nwrapped Leo in a magnificent, white robe, also richly worked with gold\nand purple; a somewhat similar robe but of less ornate design being\ngiven to me. Lastly, a silver sceptre was thrust into his hand and into\nmine a plain wand. This sceptre was shaped like a crook, and the sight\nof it gave me some clue to the nature of the forthcoming ceremony.\n\n\"The crook of Osiris!\" I whispered to Leo.\n\n\"Look here,\" he answered, \"I don't want to impersonate any Egyptian god,\nor to be mixed up in their heathen idolatries; in fact, I won't.\"\n\n\"Better go through with it,\" I suggested, \"probably it is only something\nsymbolical.\"\n\nBut Leo, who, notwithstanding the strange circumstances connected with\nhis life, retained the religious principles in which I had educated him,\nvery strongly indeed, refused to move an inch until the nature of this\nservice was made clear to him. Indeed he expressed himself upon the\nsubject with vigour to Oros. At first the priest seemed puzzled what to\ndo, then explained that the forthcoming ceremony was one of betrothal.\n\nOn learning this Leo raised no further objections, asking only with some\nnervousness whether the Khania would be present. Oros answered \"No,\" as\nshe had already departed to Kaloon, vowing war and vengeance.\n\nThen we were led through long passages, till finally we emerged into the\ngallery immediately in front of the great wooden doors of the apse. At\nour approach these swung open and we entered it, Oros going first, then\nLeo, then myself, and following us, the procession of attendant priests.\n\nAs soon as our eyes became accustomed to the dazzling glare of the\nflaming pillars, we saw that some great rite was in progress in the\ntemple, for in front of the divine statue of Motherhood, white-robed\nand arranged in serried ranks, stood the company of the priests to\nthe number of over two hundred, and behind these the company of the\npriestesses. Facing this congregation and a little in advance of the two\npillars of fire that flared on either side of the shrine, Ayesha herself\nwas seated in a raised chair so that she could be seen of all, while to\nher right stood a similar chair of which I could guess the purpose.\n\nShe was unveiled and gorgeously apparelled, though save for the white\nbeneath, her robes were those of a queen rather than of a priestess.\nAbout her radiant brow ran a narrow band of gold, whence rose the head\nof a hooded asp cut out of a single, crimson jewel, beneath which in\nendless profusion the glorious waving hair flowed down and around,\nhiding even the folds of her purple cloak.\n\nThis cloak, opening in front, revealed an undertunic of white silk cut\nlow upon her bosom and kept in place by a golden girdle, a double-headed\nsnake, so like to that which She had worn in Kor that it might have been\nthe same. Her naked arms were bare of ornament, and in her right hand\nshe held the jewelled sistrum set with its gems and bells.\n\nNo empress could have looked more royal and no woman was ever half so\nlovely, for to Ayesha's human beauty was added a spiritual glory,\nher heritage alone. Seeing her we could see naught else. The rhythmic\nmovement of the bodies of the worshippers, the rolling grandeur of their\nchant of welcome echoed from the mighty roof, the fearful torches of\nliving flame; all these things were lost on us. For there re-born,\nenthroned, her arms stretched out in gracious welcome, sat that perfect\nand immortal woman, the appointed bride of one of us, the friend and\nlady of the other, her divine presence breathing power, mystery and\nlove.\n\nOn we marched between the ranks of hierophants, till Oros and the\npriests left us and we stood alone face to face with Ayesha. Now she\nlifted her sceptre and the chant ceased. In the midst of the following\nsilence, she rose from her seat and gliding down its steps, came to\nwhere Leo stood and touched him on the forehead with her sistrum, crying\nin a loud, sweet voice--\"Behold the Chosen of the Hesea!\" whereon all\nthat audience echoed in a shout of thunder--\"Welcome to the Chosen of\nthe Hesea!\"\n\nThen while the echoes of that glad cry yet rang round the rocky walls,\nAyesha motioned to me to stand at her side, and taking Leo by the hand\ndrew him towards her, so that now he faced the white-robed company.\nHolding him thus she began to speak in clear and silvery tones.\n\n\"Priests and priestesses of Hes, servants with her of the Mother of the\nworld, hear me. Now for the first time I appear among you as _I_ am, you\nwho heretofore have looked but on a hooded shape, not knowing its form\nor fashion. Learn now the reason that I draw my veil. Ye see this man,\nwhom ye believed a stranger that with his companion had wandered to\nour shrine. I tell you that he is no stranger; that of old, in lives\nforgotten, he was my lord who now comes to seek his love again. Say, is\nit not so, Kallikrates?\"\n\n\"It is so,\" answered Leo.\n\n\"Priests and priestesses of Hes, as ye know, from the beginning it has\nbeen the right and custom of her who holds my place to choose one to be\nher lord. Is it not so?\"\n\n\"It is so, O Hes,\" they answered.\n\nShe paused a while, then with a gesture of infinite sweetness turned to\nLeo, bent towards him thrice and slowly sank upon her knee.\n\n\"Say thou,\" Ayesha said, looking up at him with her wondrous eyes, \"say\nbefore these here gathered, and all those witnesses whom thou canst not\nsee, dost thou again accept me as thy affianced bride?\"\n\n\"Aye, Lady,\" he answered, in a deep but shaken voice, \"now and for\never.\"\n\nThen while all watched, in the midst of a great silence, Ayesha rose,\ncast down her sistrum sceptre that rang upon the rocky floor, and\nstretched out her arms towards him.\n\nLeo also bent towards her, and would have kissed her upon the lips. But\nI who watched, saw his face grow white as it drew near to hers. While\nthe radiance crept from her brow to his, turning his bright hair to\ngold, I saw also that this strong man trembled like a reed and seemed as\nthough he were about to fall.\n\nI think that Ayesha noted it too, for ere ever their lips met, she\nthrust him from her and again that grey mist of fear gathered on her\nface.\n\nIn an instant it passed. She had slipped from him and with her hand held\nhis hand as though to support him. Thus they stood till his feet grew\nfirm and his strength returned.\n\nOros restored the sceptre to her, and lifting it she said--\"O love and\nlord, take thou the place prepared for thee, where thou shalt sit for\never at my side, for with myself I give thee more than thou canst know\nor than I will tell thee now. Mount thy throne, O Affianced of Hes, and\nreceive the worship of thy priests.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" he answered with a start as that word fell upon his ears. \"Here\nand now I say it once and for all. I am but a man who know nothing of\nstrange gods, their attributes and ceremonials. None shall bow the knee\nto me and on earth, Ayesha, I bow mine to thee alone.\"\n\nNow at this bold speech some of those who heard it looked astonished and\nwhispered to each other, while a voice called--\"Beware, thou Chosen, of\nthe anger of the Mother!\"\n\nAgain for a moment Ayesha looked afraid, then with a little laugh, swept\nthe thing aside, saying--\"Surely with that I should be content. For me,\nO Love, thy adoration for thee the betrothal song, no more.\"\n\nSo having no choice Leo mounted the throne, where notwithstanding his\nsplendid presence, enhanced as it was by those glittering robes, he\nlooked ill enough at ease, as indeed must any man of his faith and\nrace. Happily however, if some act of semi-idolatrous homage had been\nproposed, Ayesha found a means to prevent its celebration, and soon all\nsuch matters were forgotten both by the singers who sang, and us who\nlistened to the majestic chant that followed.\n\nOf its words unfortunately we were able to understand but little, both\nbecause of the volume of sound and of the secret, priestly language in\nwhich it was given, though its general purport could not be mistaken.\n\nThe female voices began it, singing very low, and conveying a strange\nimpression of time and distance. Now followed bursts of gladness\nalternating with melancholy chords suggesting sighs and tears and\nsorrows long endured, and at the end a joyous, triumphant paean thrown\nto and fro between the men and women singers, terminating in one\nunited chorus repeated again and again, louder and yet louder, till it\nculminated in a veritable crash of melody, then of a sudden ceased.\n\nAyesha rose and waved her sceptre, whereon all the company bowed thrice,\nthen turned and breaking into some sweet, low chant that sounded like a\nlullaby, marched, rank after rank, across the width of the Sanctuary and\nthrough the carven doors which closed behind the last of them.\n\nWhen all had gone, leaving us alone, save for the priest Oros and the\npriestess Papave, who remained in attendance on their mistress, Ayesha,\nwho sat gazing before her with dreaming, empty eyes, seemed to awake,\nfor she rose and said--\"A noble chant, is it not, and an ancient? It was\nthe wedding song of the feast of Isis and Osiris at Behbit in Egypt, and\nthere I heard it before ever I saw the darksome Caves of Kor. Often have\nI observed, my Holly, that music lingers longer than aught else in this\nchangeful world, though it is rare that the very words should remain\nunvaried. Come, beloved--tell me, by what name shall I call thee? Thou\nart Kallikrates and yet----\"\n\n\"Call me Leo, Ayesha,\" he answered, \"as I was christened in the only\nlife of which I have any knowledge. This Kallikrates seems to have been\nan unlucky man, and the deeds he did, if in truth he was aught other\nthan a tool in the hand of destiny, have bred no good to the inheritors\nof his body--or his spirit, whichever it may be--or to those women with\nwhom his life was intertwined. Call me Leo, then, for of Kallikrates I\nhave had enough since that night when I looked upon the last of him in\nKor.\"\n\n\"Ah! I remember,\" she answered, \"when thou sawest thyself lying in that\nnarrow bed, and I sang thee a song, did I not, of the past and of the\nfuture? I can recall two lines of it; the rest I have forgotten--\n\n     \"'Onward, never weary, clad with splendour for a robe!\n     Till accomplished be our fate, and the night is rushing down.'\n\n\"Yes, my Leo, now indeed we are 'clad with splendour for a robe,' and\nnow our fate draws near to its accomplishment. Then perchance will come\nthe down-rushing of the night;\" and she sighed, looked up tenderly and\nsaid, \"See, I am talking to thee in Arabic. Hast thou forgotten it?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then let it be our tongue, for I love it best of all, who lisped it at\nmy mother's knee. Now leave me here alone awhile; I would think. Also,\"\nshe added thoughtfully, and speaking with a strange and impressive\ninflexion of the voice, \"there are some to whom I must give audience.\"\n\nSo we went, all of us, supposing that Ayesha was about to receive a\ndeputation of the Chiefs of the Mountain Tribes who came to felicitate\nher upon her betrothal.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nTHE THIRD ORDEAL\n\nAn hour, two hours passed, while we strove to rest in our sleeping\nplace, but could not, for some influence disturbed us.\n\n\"Why does not Ayesha come?\" asked Leo at length, pausing in his walk up\nand down the room. \"I want to see her again; I cannot bear to be apart\nfrom her. I feel as though she were drawing me to her.\"\n\n\"How can I tell you? Ask Oros; he is outside the door.\"\n\nSo he went and asked him, but Oros only smiled, and answered that the\nHesea had not entered her chamber, so doubtless she must still remain in\nthe Sanctuary.\n\n\"Then I am going to look for her. Come, Oros, and you too, Horace.\"\n\nOros bowed, but declined, saying that he was bidden to bide at our door,\nadding that we, \"to whom all the paths were open,\" could return to the\nSanctuary if we thought well.\n\n\"I do think well,\" replied Leo sharply. \"Will you come, Horace, or shall\nI go without you?\"\n\nI hesitated. The Sanctuary was a public place, it is true, but Ayesha\nhad said that she desired to be alone there for awhile. Without more\nwords, however, Leo shrugged his shoulders and started.\n\n\"You will never find your way,\" I said, and followed him.\n\nWe went down the long passages that were dimly lighted with lamps and\ncame to the gallery. Here we found no lamps; still we groped our way\nto the great wooden doors. They were shut, but Leo pushed upon them\nimpatiently, and one of them swung open a little, so that we could\nsqueeze ourselves between them. As we passed it closed noiselessly\nbehind us.\n\nNow we should have been in the Sanctuary, and in the full blaze of\nthose awful columns of living fire. But they were out, or we had strayed\nelsewhere; at least the darkness was intense. We tried to work our way\nback to the doors again, but could not. We were lost.\n\nMore, something oppressed us; we did not dare to speak. We went on a few\npaces and stopped, for we became aware that we were not alone. Indeed,\nit seemed to me that we stood in the midst of a thronging multitude,\nbut not of men and women. Beings pressed about us; we could feel their\nrobes, yet could not touch them; we could feel their breath, but it was\n_cold_. The air stirred all round us as they passed to and fro, passed\nin endless numbers. It was as though we had entered a cathedral filled\nwith the vast congregation of all the dead who once had worshipped\nthere. We grew afraid--my face was damp with fear, the hair stood up\nupon my head. We seemed to have wandered into a hall of the Shades.\n\nAt length light appeared far away, and we saw that it emanated from the\ntwo pillars of fire which had burned on either side of the Shrine, that\nof a sudden became luminous. So we were in the Sanctuary, and still\nnear to the doors. Now those pillars were not bright; they were low\nand lurid; the rays from them scarcely reached us standing in the dense\nshadow.\n\nBut if we could not be seen in them we still could see. Look! Yonder sat\nAyesha on a throne, and oh! she was awful in her death-like majesty.\nThe blue light of the sunken columns played upon her, and in it she\nsat erect, with such a face and mien of pride as no human creature ever\nwore. Power seemed to flow from her; yes, it flowed from those wide-set,\nglittering eyes like light from jewels.\n\nShe seemed a Queen of Death receiving homage from the dead. More, she\n_was_ receiving homage from dead or living--I know not which--for, as I\nthought it, a shadowy Shape arose before the throne and bent the knee to\nher, then another, and another, and another.\n\nAs each vague Being appeared and bowed its starry head she raised her\nsceptre in answering salutation. We could hear the distant tinkle of the\nsistrum bells, the only sound in all that place, yes, and see her\nlips move, though no whisper reached us from them. Surely spirits were\nworshipping her!\n\nWe gripped each other. We shrank back and found the door. It gave to\nour push. Now we were in the passages again, and now we had reached our\nroom.\n\nAt its entrance Oros was standing as we had left him. He greeted us with\nhis fixed smile, taking no note of the terror written on our faces. We\npassed him, and entering the room stared at each other.\n\n\"What is she?\" gasped Leo. \"An angel?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered, \"something of that sort.\" But to myself I thought\nthat there are doubtless many kinds of angels.\n\n\"And what were those--those _shadows_--doing?\" he asked again.\n\n\"Welcoming her after her transformation, I suppose. But perhaps they\nwere not shadows--only priests disguised and conducting some secret\nceremonial!\"\n\nLeo shrugged his shoulders but made no other answer.\n\nAt length the door opened, and Oros, entering, said that the Hesea\ncommanded our presence in her chamber.\n\nSo, still oppressed with fear and wonder--for what we had seen was\nperhaps more dreadful than anything that had gone before--we went, to\nfind Ayesha seated and looking somewhat weary, but otherwise unchanged.\nWith her was the priestess Papave, who had just unrobed her of the royal\nmantle which she wore in the Sanctuary.\n\nAyesha beckoned Leo to her, taking his hand and searching his face with\nher eyes, not without anxiety as I thought.\n\nNow I turned, purposing to leave them alone, but she saw, and said to\nme, smiling--\"Why wouldst thou forsake us, Holly? To go back to the\nSanctuary once more?\" and she looked at me with meaning in her glance.\n\"Hast thou questions to ask of the statue of the Mother yonder that thou\nlovest the place so much? They say it speaks, telling of the future to\nthose who dare to kneel beside it uncompanioned from night till dawn.\nYet I have often done so, but to me it has never spoken, though none\nlong to learn the future more.\"\n\nI made no answer, nor did she seem to expect any, for she went on at\nonce--\"Nay, bide here and let us have done with all sad and solemn\nthoughts. We three will sup together as of old, and for awhile forget\nour fears and cares, and be happy as children who know not sin and\ndeath, or that change which is death indeed. Oros, await my lord\nwithout. Papave, I will call thee later to disrobe me. Till then let\nnone disturb us.\"\n\nThe room that Ayesha inhabited was not very large, as we saw by the\nhanging lamps with which it was lighted. It was plainly though richly\nfurnished, the rock walls being covered with tapestries, and the tables\nand chairs inlaid with silver, but the only token that here a woman had\nher home was that about it stood several bowls of flowers. One of these,\nI remember, was filled with the delicate harebells I had admired, dug up\nroots and all, and set in moss.\n\n\"A poor place,\" said Ayesha, \"yet better than that in which I dwelt\nthose two thousand years awaiting thy coming, Leo, for, see, beyond\nit is a garden, wherein I sit,\" and she sank down upon a couch by the\ntable, motioning to us to take our places opposite to her.\n\nThe meal was simple; for us, eggs boiled hard and cold venison; for her,\nmilk, some little cakes of flour, and mountain berries.\n\nPresently Leo rose and threw off his gorgeous, purple-broidered robe,\nwhich he still wore, and cast upon a chair the crook-headed sceptre\nthat Oros had again thrust into his hand. Ayesha smiled as he did so,\nsaying--\"It would seem that thou holdest these sacred emblems in but\nsmall respect.\"\n\n\"Very small,\" he answered. \"Thou heardest my words in the Sanctuary,\nAyesha, so let us make a pact. Thy religion I do not understand, but I\nunderstand my own, and not even for thy sake will I take part in what I\nhold to be idolatry.\"\n\nNow I thought that she would be angered by this plain speaking, but she\nonly bowed her head and answered meekly--\"Thy will is mine, Leo, though\nit will not be easy always to explain thy absence from the ceremonies in\nthe temple. Yet thou hast a right to thine own faith, which doubtless is\nmine also.\"\n\n\"How can that be?\" he asked, looking up.\n\n\"Because all great Faiths are the same, changed a little to suit the\nneeds of passing times and peoples. What taught that of Egypt, which,\nin a fashion, we still follow here? That hidden in a multitude of\nmanifestations, one Power great and good, rules all the universes: that\nthe holy shall inherit a life eternal and the vile, eternal death: that\nmen shall be shaped and judged by their own hearts and deeds, and here\nand hereafter drink of the cup which they have brewed: that their real\nhome is not on earth, but beyond the earth, where all riddles shall be\nanswered and all sorrows cease. Say, dost thou believe these things, as\nI do?\"\n\n\"Aye, Ayesha, but Hes or Isis is thy goddess, for hast thou not told\nus tales of thy dealings with her in the past, and did we not hear thee\nmake thy prayer to her? Who, then, is this goddess Hes?\"\n\n\"Know, Leo, that she is what I named her--Nature's soul, no divinity,\nbut the secret spirit of the world; that universal Motherhood, whose\nsymbol thou hast seen yonder, and in whose mysteries lie hid all earthly\nlife and knowledge.\"\n\n\"Does, then, this merciful Motherhood follow her votaries with death\nand evil, as thou sayest she has followed thee for thy disobedience, and\nme--and another--because of some unnatural vows broken long ago?\" Leo\nasked quietly.\n\nResting her arm upon the table, Ayesha looked at him with sombre eyes\nand answered--\"In that Faith of thine of which thou speakest are there\nperchance two gods, each having many ministers: a god of good and a god\nof evil, an Osiris and a Set?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"I thought it. And the god of ill is strong, is he not, and can put\non the shape of good? Tell me, then, Leo, in the world that is to-day,\nwhereof I know so little, hast thou ever heard of frail souls who for\nsome earthly bribe have sold themselves to that evil one, or to his\nminister, and been paid their price in bitterness and anguish?\"\n\n\"All wicked folk do as much in this form or in that,\" he answered.\n\n\"And if once there lived a woman who was mad with the thirst for beauty,\nfor life, for wisdom, and for love, might she not--oh! might she not\nperchance----\"\n\n\"Sell herself to the god called Set, or one of his angels? Ayesha,\ndost thou mean\"--and Leo rose, speaking in a voice that was full of\nfear--\"that thou art such a woman?\"\n\n\"And if so?\" she asked, also rising and drawing slowly near to him.\n\n\"If so,\" he answered hoarsely, \"if so, I think that perhaps we had best\nfulfil our fates apart----\"\n\n\"Ah!\" she said, with a little scream of pain as though a knife had\nstabbed her, \"wouldst thou away to Atene? I tell thee that thou canst\nnot leave me. I have power--above all men thou shouldst know it, whom\nonce I slew. Nay, thou hast no memory, poor creature of a breath, and\nI--I remember too well. I will not hold thee dead again--I'll hold\nthee living. Look now on my beauty, Leo\"--and she bent her swaying\nform towards him, compelling him with her glorious, alluring eyes--\"and\nbegone if thou canst. Why, thou drawest nearer to me. Man, that is not\nthe path of flight.\n\n\"Nay, I will not tempt thee with these common lures. Go, Leo, if thou\nwilt. Go, my love, and leave me to my loneliness and my sin. Now--at\nonce. Atene will shelter thee till spring, when thou canst cross the\nmountains and return to thine own world again, and to those things of\ncommon life which are thy joy. See, Leo, I veil myself that thou mayest\nnot be tempted,\" and she flung the corner of her cloak about her head,\nthen asked a sudden question through it--\"Didst thou not but now return\nto the Sanctuary with Holly after I bade thee leave me there alone?\nMethought I saw the two of you standing by its doors.\"\n\n\"Yes, we came to seek thee,\" he answered.\n\n\"And found more than ye sought, as often chances to the bold--is it not\nso? Well, I willed that ye should come and see, and protected you where\nothers might have died.\"\n\n\"What didst thou there upon the throne, and whose were those forms which\nwe saw bending before thee?\" he asked coldly.\n\n\"I have ruled in many shapes and lands, Leo. Perchance they were ancient\ncompanions and servitors of mine come to greet me once again and to hear\nmy tidings. Or perchance they were but shadows of thy brain, pictures\nlike those upon the fire, that it pleased me to summon to thy sight, to\ntry thy strength and constancy.\n\n\"Leo Vincey, know now the truth; that all things are illusions, even\nthat there exists no future and no past, that what has been and what\nshall be already _is_ eternally. Know that I, Ayesha, am but a magic\nwraith, foul when thou seest me foul, fair when thou seest me fair; a\nspirit-bubble reflecting a thousand lights in the sunshine of thy smile,\ngrey as dust and gone in the shadow of thy frown. Think of the throned\nQueen before whom the shadowy Powers bowed and worship, for that is I.\nThink of the hideous, withered Thing thou sawest naked on the rock, and\nflee away, for that is I. Or keep me lovely, and adore, knowing all evil\ncentred in my spirit, for that is I. Now, Leo, thou hast the truth. Put\nme from thee for ever and for ever if thou wilt, and be safe; or clasp\nme, clasp me to thy heart, and in payment for my lips and love take my\nsin upon thy head! Nay, Holly, be thou silent, for now he must judge\nalone.\"\n\nLeo turned, as I thought, at first, to find the door. But it was not so,\nfor he did but walk up and down the room awhile. Then he came back to\nwhere Ayesha stood, and spoke quite simply and in a very quiet voice,\nsuch as men of his nature often assume in moments of great emotion.\n\n\"Ayesha,\" he said, \"when I saw thee as thou wast, aged and--thou knowest\nhow--I clung to thee. Now, when thou hast told me the secret of this\nunholy pact of thine, when with my eyes, at least, I have seen thee\nreigning a mistress of spirits good or ill, yet I cling to thee. Let thy\nsin, great or little--whate'er it is--be my sin also. In truth, I feel\nits weight sink to my soul and become a part of me, and although I have\nno vision or power of prophecy, I am sure that I shall not escape its\npunishment. Well, though I be innocent, let me bear it for thy sake. I\nam content.\"\n\nAyesha heard, the cloak slipped from her head, and for a moment she\nstood silent like one amazed, then burst into a passion of sudden tears.\nDown she went before him, and clinging to his garments, she bowed her\nstately shape until her forehead touched the ground. Yes, that proud\nbeing, who was more than mortal, whose nostrils but now had drunk the\nincense of the homage of ghosts or spirits, humbled herself at this\nman's feet.\n\nWith an exclamation of horror, half-maddened at the piteous sight, Leo\nsprang to one side, then stooping, lifted and led her still weeping to\nthe couch.\n\n\"Thou knowest not what thou hast done,\" Ayesha said at last. \"Let all\nthou sawest on the Mountain's crest or in the Sanctuary be but visions\nof the night; let that tale of an offended goddess be a parable, a\nfable, if thou wilt. This at least is true, that ages since I sinned for\nthee and against thee and another; that ages since I bought beauty and\nlife indefinite wherewith I might win thee and endow thee at a cost\nwhich few would dare; that I have paid interest on the debt, in mockery,\nutter loneliness, and daily pain which scarce could be endured, until\nthe bond fell due at last and must be satisfied.\n\n\"Yes, how I may not tell thee, thou and thou alone stoodst between me\nand the full discharge of this most dreadful debt--for know that in\nmercy it is given to us to redeem one another.\"\n\nNow he would have spoken, but with a motion of her hand she bade him be\nsilent, and continued--\"See now, Leo, three great dangers has thy\nbody passed of late upon its journey to my side; the Death-hounds,\nthe Mountains, and the Precipice. Know that these were but types and\nordained foreshadowings of the last threefold trial of thy soul. From\nthe pursuing passions of Atene which must have undone us both, thou hast\nescaped victorious. Thou hast endured the desert loneliness of the\nsands and snows starving for a comfort that never came. Even when the\navalanche thundered round thee thy faith stood fast as it stood above\nthe Pit of flame, while after bitter years of doubt a rushing flood\nof horror swallowed up thy hopes. As thou didst descend the glacier's\nsteep, not knowing what lay beneath that fearful path, so but now and of\nthine own choice, for very love of me, thou hast plunged headlong into\nan abyss that is deeper far, to share its terrors with my spirit. Dost\nthou understand at last?\"\n\n\"Something, not all, I think,\" he answered slowly.\n\n\"Surely thou art wrapped in a double veil of blindness,\" she cried\nimpatiently. \"Listen again:\n\n\"Hadst thou yielded to Nature's crying and rejected me but yesterday,\nin that foul shape I must perchance have lingered for uncounted time,\nplaying the poor part of priestess of a forgotten faith. This was the\nfirst temptation, the ordeal of thy flesh--nay, not the first--the\nsecond, for Atene and her lurings were the first. But thou wast loyal,\nand in the magic of thy conquering love my beauty and my womanhood were\nre-born.\n\n\"Hadst thou rejected me to-night, when, as I was bidden to do, I showed\nthee that vision in the Sanctuary and confessed to thee my soul's black\ncrime, then hopeless and helpless, unshielded by my earthly power, I\nmust have wandered on into the deep and endless night of solitude.\nThis was the third appointed test, the trial of thy spirit, and by thy\nsteadfastness, Leo, thou hast loosed the hand of Destiny from about my\nthroat. Now I am regenerate in thee--through thee may hope again for\nsome true life beyond, which thou shalt share. And yet, and yet, if thou\nshouldst suffer, as well may chance----\"\n\n\"Then I suffer, and there's an end,\" broke in Leo serenely. \"Save for\na few things my mind is clear, and there must be justice for us all at\nlast. If I have broken the bond that bound thee, if I have freed thee\nfrom some threatening, spiritual ill by taking a risk upon my head,\nwell, I have not lived, and if need be, shall not die in vain. So let us\nhave done with all these problems, or rather first answer thou me one.\nAyesha, how wast thou changed upon that peak?\"\n\n\"In flame I left thee, Leo, and in flame I did return, as in flame,\nmayhap, we shall both depart. Or perhaps the change was in the eyes of\nall of you who watched, and not in this shape of mine. I have answered.\nSeek to learn no more.\"\n\n\"One thing I do still seek to learn. Ayesha, we were betrothed to-night.\nWhen wilt thou marry me?\"\n\n\"Not yet, not yet,\" she answered hurriedly, her voice quivering as she\nspoke. \"Leo, thou must put that hope from thy thoughts awhile, and for\nsome few months, a year perchance, be content to play the part of friend\nand lover.\"\n\n\"Why so?\" he asked, with bitter disappointment. \"Ayesha, those parts\nhave been mine for many a day; more, I grow no younger, and, unlike\nthee, shall soon be old. Also, life is fleeting, and sometimes I think\nthat I near its end.\"\n\n\"Speak no such evil-omened words,\" she said, springing from the couch\nand stamping her sandalled foot upon the ground in anger born of fear.\n\"Yet thou sayest truth; thou art unfortified against the accidents of\ntime and chance. Oh! horrible, horrible; thou mightest die again, and\nleave me living.\"\n\n\"Then give me of thy life, Ayesha.\"\n\n\"That would I gladly, all of it, couldst thou but repay me with the boon\nof death to come.\n\n\"Oh! ye poor mortals,\" she went on, with a sudden burst of passion; \"ye\nbeseech your gods for the gift of many years, being ignorant that ye\nwould sow a seed within your breasts whence ye must garner ten thousand\nmiseries. Know ye not that this world is indeed the wide house of hell,\nin whose chambers from time to time the spirit tarries a little while,\nthen, weary and aghast, speeds wailing to the peace that it has won.\n\n\"Think then what it is to live on here eternally and yet be human; to\nage in soul and see our beloved die and pass to lands whither we may\nnot hope to follow; to wait while drop by drop the curse of the long\ncenturies falls upon our imperishable being, like water slow dripping on\na diamond that it cannot wear, till they be born anew forgetful of us,\nand again sink from our helpless arms into the void unknowable.\n\n\"Think what it is to see the sins we sin, the tempting look, the word\nidle or unkind--aye, even the selfish thought or struggle, multiplied\nten thousandfold and more eternal than ourselves, spring up upon the\nuniversal bosom of the earth to be the bane of a million destinies,\nwhilst the everlasting Finger writes its endless count, and a cold\nvoice of Justice cries in our conscience-haunted solitude, 'Oh! soul\nunshriven, behold the ripening harvest thy wanton hand did scatter, and\nlong in vain for the waters of forgetfulness.'\n\n\"Think what it is to have every earthly wisdom, yet to burn unsatisfied\nfor the deeper and forbidden draught; to gather up all wealth and power\nand let them slip again, like children weary of a painted toy; to sweep\nthe harp of fame, and, maddened by its jangling music, to stamp it small\nbeneath our feet; to snatch at pleasure's goblet and find its wine is\nsand, and at length, outworn, to cast us down and pray the pitiless gods\nwith whose stolen garment we have wrapped ourselves, to take it back\nagain, and suffer us to slink naked to the grave.\n\n\"Such is the life thou askest, Leo. Say, wilt thou have it now?\"\n\n\"If it may be shared with thee,\" he answered. \"These woes are born of\nloneliness, but then our perfect fellowship would turn them into joy.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" she said, \"while it was permitted to endure. So be it, Leo. In\nthe spring, when the snows melt, we will journey together to Libya, and\nthere thou shalt be bathed in the Fount of Life, that forbidden Essence\nof which once thou didst fear to drink. Afterwards I will wed thee.\"\n\n\"That place is closed for ever, Ayesha.\"\n\n\"Not to my feet and thine,\" she answered. \"Fear not, my love, were this\nmountain heaped thereon, I would blast a path through it with mine eyes\nand lay its secret bare. Oh! would that thou wast as I am, for then\nbefore tomorrow's sun we'd watch the rolling pillar thunder by, and thou\nshouldst taste its glory.\n\n\"But it may not be. Hunger or cold can starve thee, and waters drown;\nswords can slay thee, or sickness sap away thy strength. Had it not been\nfor the false Atene, who disobeyed my words, as it was foredoomed\nthat she should do, by this day we were across the mountains, or had\ntravelled northward through the frozen desert and the rivers. Now we\nmust await the melting of the snows, for winter is at hand, and in it,\nas thou knowest, no man can live upon their heights.\"\n\n\"Eight months till April before we can start, and how long to cross\nthe mountains and all the vast distances beyond, and the seas, and the\nswamps of Kor? Why, at the best, Ayesha, two years must go by before we\ncan even find the place;\" and he fell to entreating her to let them be\nwed at once and journey afterwards.\n\nBut she said, Nay, and nay, and nay, it should not be, till at length,\nas though fearing his pleading, or that of her own heart, she rose and\ndismissed us.\n\n\"Ah! my Holly,\" she said to me as we three parted, \"I promised thee and\nmyself some few hours of rest and of the happiness of quiet, and thou\nseest how my desire has been fulfilled. Those old Egyptians were wont\nto share their feasts with one grizzly skeleton, but here I counted four\nto-night that you both could see, and they are named Fear, Suspense,\nForeboding, and Love-denied. Doubtless also, when these are buried\nothers will come to haunt us, and snatch the poor morsel from our lips.\n\n\"So hath it ever been with me, whose feet misfortune dogs. Yet I hope\non, and now many a barrier lies behind us; and Leo, thou hast been\ntried in the appointed, triple fires and yet proved true. Sweet be thy\nslumbers, O my love, and sweeter still thy dreams, for know, my soul\nshall share them. I vow to thee that to-morrow we'll be happy, aye,\nto-morrow without fail.\"\n\n\"Why will she not marry me at once?\" asked Leo, when we were alone in\nour chamber. \"Because she is afraid,\" I answered.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nLEO AND THE LEOPARD\n\nDuring the weeks that followed these momentous days often and often I\nwondered to myself whether a more truly wretched being had ever lived\nthan the woman, or the spirit, whom we knew as She, Hes, and Ayesha.\nWhether in fact also, or in our imagination only, she had arisen from\nthe ashes of her hideous age into the full bloom of perpetual life and\nbeauty inconceivable.\n\nThese things at least were certain: Ayesha had achieved the secret of\nan existence so enduring that for all human purposes it might be called\nunending. Within certain limitations--such as her utter inability to\nforesee the future--undoubtedly also, she was endued with powers that\ncan only be described as supernatural.\n\nHer rule over the strange community amongst whom she lived was absolute;\nindeed, its members regarded her as a goddess, and as such she was\nworshipped. After marvellous adventures, the man who was her very life,\nI might almost say her soul, whose being was so mysteriously intertwined\nwith hers, whom she loved also with the intensest human passion of which\nwoman can be capable, had sought her out in this hidden corner of the\nworld.\n\nMore, thrice he had proved his unalterable fidelity to her. First,\nby his rejection of the royal and beautiful, if undisciplined, Atene.\nSecondly, by clinging to Ayesha when she seemed to be repulsive to every\nnatural sense. Thirdly, after that homage scene in the Sanctuary--though\nwith her unutterable perfections before his eyes this did not appear to\nbe so wonderful--by steadfastness in the face of her terrible avowal,\ntrue or false, that she had won her gifts and him through some\ndim, unholy pact with the powers of evil, in the unknown fruits\nand consequences of which he must be involved as the price of her\npossession.\n\nYet Ayesha was miserable. Even in her lightest moods it was clear to\nme that those skeletons at the feast of which she had spoken were her\ncontinual companions. Indeed, when we were alone she would acknowledge\nit in dark hints and veiled allegories or allusions. Crushed though her\nrival the Khania Atene might be, also she was still jealous of her.\n\nPerhaps \"afraid\" would be a better word, for some instinct seemed to\nwarn Ayesha that soon or late her hour would come to Atene again, and\nthat then it would be her own turn to drink of the bitter waters of\ndespair.\n\nWhat troubled her more a thousandfold, however, were her fears for Leo.\nAs may well be understood, to stand in his intimate relationship to this\nhalf divine and marvellous being, and yet not to be allowed so much as\nto touch her lips, did not conduce to his physical or mental well-being,\nespecially as he knew that the wall of separation must not be climbed\nfor at least two years. Little wonder that Leo lost appetite, grew thin\nand pale, and could not sleep, or that he implored her continually to\nrescind her decree and marry him.\n\nBut on this point Ayesha was immovable. Instigated thereto by Leo, and\nI may add my own curiosity, when we were alone I questioned her again\nas to the reasons of this self-denying ordinance. All she would tell me,\nhowever, was that between them rose the barrier of Leo's mortality, and\nthat until his physical being had been impregnated with the mysterious\nvirtue of the Vapour of Life, it was not wise that she should take him\nas a husband.\n\nI asked her why, seeing that though a long-lived one, she was still a\nwoman, whereon her face assumed a calm but terrifying smile, and she\nanswered--\"Art so sure, my Holly? Tell me, do your women wear such\njewels as that set upon my brow?\" and she pointed to the faint but\nlambent light which glowed about her forehead.\n\nMore, she began slowly to stroke her abundant hair, then her breast and\nbody. Wherever her fingers passed the mystic light was born, until in\nthat darkened room--for the dusk was gathering--she shimmered from head\nto foot like the water of a phosphorescent sea, a being glorious yet\nfearful to behold. Then she waved her hand, and, save for the gentle\nradiance on her brow, became as she had been.\n\n\"Art so sure, my Holly?\" Ayesha repeated. \"Nay, shrink not; that flame\nwill not burn thee. Mayhap thou didst but imagine it, as I have noted\nthou dost imagine many things; for surely no woman could clothe herself\nin light and live, nor has so much as the smell of fire passed upon my\ngarments.\"\n\nThen at length my patience was outworn, and I grew angry.\n\n\"I am sure of nothing, Ayesha,\" I answered, \"except that thou wilt make\nus mad with all these tricks and changes. Say, art thou a spirit then?\"\n\n\"We are all spirits,\" she said reflectively, \"and I, perhaps, more than\nsome. Who can be certain?\"\n\n\"Not I,\" I answered. \"Yet I implore, woman or spirit, tell me one thing.\nTell me the truth. In the beginning what wast thou to Leo, and what was\nhe to thee?\"\n\nShe looked at me very solemnly and answered--\"Does my memory deceive\nme, Holly, or is it written in the first book of the Law of the Hebrews,\nwhich once I used to study, that the sons of Heaven came down to the\ndaughters of men, and found that they were fair?\"\n\n\"It is so written,\" I answered.\n\n\"Then, Holly, might it not have chanced that once a daughter of Heaven\ncame down to a man of Earth and loved him well? Might it not chance that\nfor her great sin, she, this high, fallen star, who had befouled her\nimmortal state for him, was doomed to suffer till at length his love,\nmade divine by pain and faithful even to a memory, was permitted to\nredeem her?\"\n\nNow at length I saw light and sprang up eagerly, but in a cold voice she\nadded:\n\n\"Nay, Holly, cease to question me, for there are things of which I can\nbut speak to thee in figures and in parables, not to mock and bewilder\nthee, but because I must. Interpret them as thou wilt. Still, Atene\nthought me no mortal, since she told us that man and spirit may not\nmate; and there are matters in which I let her judgment weigh with me,\nas without doubt now, as in other lives, she and that old Shaman, her\nuncle, have wisdom, aye, and foresight. So bid my lord press me no more\nto wed him, for it gives me pain to say him nay--ah! thou knowest not\nhow much.\n\n\"Moreover, I will declare myself to thee, old friend; whatever else\nI be, at least I am too womanly to listen to the pleadings of my best\nbeloved and not myself be moved. See, I have set a curb upon desire\nand drawn it until my heart bleeds; but if he pursues me with continual\nwords and looks of burning love, who knoweth but that I shall kindle in\nhis flame and throw the reins of reason to the winds?\n\n\"Oh, then together we might race adown our passions' steep; together\ndare the torrent that rages at its foot, and there perchance be whelmed\nor torn asunder. Nay, nay, another space of journeying, but a little\nspace, and we reach the bridge my wisdom found, and cross it safely, and\nbeyond for ever ride on at ease through the happy meadows of our love.\"\n\nThen she was silent, nor would she speak more upon the matter. Also--and\nthis was the worst of it--even now I was not sure that she told me the\ntruth, or, at any rate, all of it, for to Ayesha's mind truth seemed\nmany coloured as are the rays of light thrown from the different faces\nof a cut jewel. We never could be certain which shade of it she was\npleased to present, who, whether by preference or of necessity, as\nshe herself had said, spoke of such secrets in figures of speech and\nparables.\n\nIt is a fact that to this hour I do not know whether Ayesha is spirit\nor woman, or, as I suspect, a blend of both. I do not know the limits of\nher powers, or if that elaborate story of the beginning of her love for\nLeo was true--which personally I doubt--or but a fable, invented by her\nmind, and through it, as she had hinted, pictured on the flame for her\nown hidden purposes.\n\nI do not know whether when first we saw her on the Mountain she was\nreally old and hideous, or did but put on that shape in our eyes in\norder to test her lover. I do not know whether, as the priest Oros bore\nwitness--which he may well have been bidden to do--her spirit passed\ninto the body of the dead priestess of Hes, or whether when she\nseemed to perish there so miserably, her body and her soul were wafted\nstraightway from the Caves of Kor to this Central Asian peak.\n\nI do not know why, as she was so powerful, she did not come to seek us,\ninstead of leaving us to seek her through so many weary years, though I\nsuggest that some superior force forbade her to do more than companion\nus unseen, watching our every act, reading our every thought, until at\nlength we reached the predestined place and hour. Also, as will appear,\nthere were other things of which this is not the time to speak, whereby\nI am still more tortured and perplexed.\n\nIn short, I know nothing, except that my existence has been intertangled\nwith one of the great mysteries of the world; that the glorious being\ncalled Ayesha won the secret of life from whatever power holds it in its\nkeeping; that she alleged--although of this, remember, we have no actual\nproof--such life was to be attained by bathing in a certain emanation,\nvapour or essence; that she was possessed by a passion not easy to\nunderstand, but terrific in its force and immortal in its nature,\nconcentrated upon one other being and one alone. That through this\npassion also some angry fate smote her again, again, and yet again,\nmaking of her countless days a burden, and leading the power and the\nwisdom which knew all but could foreknow nothing, into abysses of\nanguish, suspense, and disappointment such as--Heaven be thanked!--we\ncommon men and women are not called upon to plumb.\n\nFor the rest, should human eyes ever fall upon it, each reader must\nform his own opinion of this history, its true interpretation and\nsignificance. These and the exact parts played by Atene and myself in\nits development I hope to solve shortly, though not here.\n\nWell, as I have said, the upshot of it all was that Ayesha was devoured\nwith anxiety about Leo. Except in this matter of marriage, his every\nwish was satisfied, and indeed forestalled. Thus he was never again\nasked to share in any of the ceremonies of the Sanctuary, though,\nindeed, stripped of its rites and spiritual symbols, the religion of\nthe College of Hes proved pure and harmless enough. It was but a diluted\nversion of the Osiris and Isis worship of old Egypt, from which it\nhad been inherited, mixed with the Central Asian belief in the\ntransmigration or reincarnation of souls and the possibility of drawing\nnear to the ultimate Godhead by holiness of thought and life.\n\nIn fact, the head priestess and Oracle was only worshipped as a\nrepresentative of the Divinity, while the temporal aims of the College\nin practice were confined to good works, although it is true that they\nstill sighed for their lost authority over the country of Kaloon. Thus\nthey had hospitals, and during the long and severe winters, when\nthe Tribes of the Mountain slopes were often driven to the verge of\nstarvation, gave liberally to the destitute from their stores of food.\n\nLeo liked to be with Ayesha continually, so we spent each evening in her\ncompany, and much of the day also, until she found that this inactivity\ntold upon him who for years had been accustomed to endure every rigour\nof climate in the open air. After this came home to her--although she\nwas always haunted by terror lest any accident should befall him--Ayesha\ninsisted upon his going out to kill the wild sheep and the ibex, which\nlived in numbers on the mountain ridges, placing him in the charge of\nthe chiefs and huntsmen of the Tribes, with whom thus he became well\nacquainted. In this exercise, however, I accompanied him but rarely, as,\nif used too much, my arm still gave me pain.\n\nOnce indeed such an accident did happen. I was seated in the garden\nwith Ayesha and watching her. Her head rested on her hand, and she was\nlooking with her wide eyes, across which the swift thoughts passed\nlike clouds over a windy sky, or dreams through the mind of a\nsleeper--looking out vacantly towards the mountain snows. Seen thus her\nloveliness was inexpressible, amazing; merely to gaze upon it was an\nintoxication. Contemplating it, I understood indeed that, like to that\nof the fabled Helen, this gift of hers alone--and it was but one of\nmany--must have caused infinite sorrows, had she ever been permitted to\ndisplay it to the world. It would have driven humanity to madness: the\nmen with longings and the women with jealousy and hate.\n\nAnd yet in what did her surpassing beauty lie? Ayesha's face and form\nwere perfect, it is true; but so are those of some other women. Not in\nthese then did it live alone, but rather, I think, especially while what\nI may call her human moods were on her, in the soft mystery that dwelt\nupon her features and gathered and changed in her splendid eyes. Some\nsuch mystery may be seen, however faintly, on the faces of certain of\nthe masterpieces of the Greek sculptors, but Ayesha it clothed like\nan ever-present atmosphere, suggesting a glory that was not of earth,\nmaking her divine.\n\nAs I gazed at her and wondered thus, of a sudden she became terribly\nagitated, and, pointing to a shoulder of the Mountain miles and miles\naway, said--\"Look!\"\n\nI looked, but saw nothing except a sheet of distant snow.\n\n\"Blind fool, canst thou not see that my lord is in danger of his life?\"\nshe cried. \"Nay, I forgot, thou hast no vision. Take it now from me and\nlook again;\" and laying her hand, from which a strange, numbing current\nseemed to flow, upon my head, she muttered some swift words.\n\nInstantly my eyes were opened, and, not upon the distant Mountain, but\nin the air before me as it were, I saw Leo rolling over and over at\ngrips with a great snow-leopard, whilst the chief and huntsmen with him\nran round and round, seeking an opportunity to pierce the savage brute\nwith their spears and yet leave him unharmed.\n\nAyesha, rigid with terror, swayed to and fro at my side, till presently\nthe end came, for I could see Leo drive his long knife into the bowels\nof the leopard, which at once grew limp, separated from him, and after\na struggle or two in the bloodstained snow, lay still. Then he rose,\nlaughing and pointing to his rent garments, whilst one of the huntsmen\ncame forward and began to bandage some wounds in his hands and thigh\nwith strips of linen torn from his under-robe.\n\nThe vision vanished suddenly as it had come, and I felt Ayesha leaning\nheavily upon my shoulder like any other frightened woman, and heard her\ngasp--\"That danger also has passed by, but how many are there to follow?\nOh! tormented heart, how long canst thou endure!\"\n\nThen her wrath flamed up against the chief and his huntsmen, and\nshe summoned messengers and sent them out at speed with a litter and\nointments, bidding them to bear back the lord Leo and to bring his\ncompanions to her very presence.\n\n\"Thou seest what days are mine, my Holly, aye, and have been these many\nyears,\" she said; \"but those hounds shall pay me for this agony.\"\n\nNor would she suffer me to reason with her.\n\nFour hours later Leo returned, limping after the litter in which,\ninstead of himself, for whom it was sent, lay a mountain sheep and the\nskin of the snow-leopard that he had placed there to save the huntsmen\nthe labour of carrying them. Ayesha was waiting for him in the hall of\nher dwelling, and gliding to him--I cannot say she walked--overwhelmed\nhim with mingled solicitude and reproaches. He listened awhile, then\nasked--\"How dost thou know anything of this matter? The leopard skin has\nnot yet been brought to thee.\"\n\n\"I know because I saw,\" she answered. \"The worst hurt was above thy\nknee; hast thou dressed it with the salve I sent?\"\n\n\"Not I,\" he said. \"But thou hast not left this Sanctuary; how didst thou\nsee? By thy magic?\"\n\n\"If thou wilt, at least I saw, and Holly also saw thee rolling in the\nsnow with that fierce brute, while those curs ran round like scared\nchildren.\"\n\n\"I am weary of this magic,\" interrupted Leo crossly. \"Cannot a man be\nleft alone for an hour even with a leopard of the mountain? As for those\nbrave men----\"\n\nAt this moment Oros entered and whispered something, bowing low.\n\n\"As for those 'brave men,' I will deal with them,\" said Ayesha with\nbitter emphasis, and covering herself--for she never appeared unveiled\nto the people of the Mountain--she swept from the place.\n\n\"Where has she gone, Horace?\" asked Leo. \"To one of her services in the\nSanctuary?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" I answered; \"but if so, I think it will be that chief's\nburial service.\"\n\n\"Will it?\" he exclaimed, and instantly limped after her.\n\nA minute or two later I thought it wise to follow. In the Sanctuary a\ncurious scene was in progress. Ayesha was seated in front of the statue.\nBefore her, very much frightened, knelt a brawny, red-haired chieftain\nand five of his followers, who still carried their hunting spears, while\nwith folded arms and an exceedingly grim look upon his face, Leo, who,\nas I learned afterwards, had already interfered and been silenced, stood\nupon one side listening to what passed. At a little distance behind were\na dozen or more of the temple guards, men armed with swords and picked\nfor their strength and stature.\n\nAyesha, in her sweetest voice, was questioning the men as to how the\nleopard, of which the skin lay before her, had come to attack Leo. The\nchief answered that they had tracked the brute to its lair between two\nrocks; that one of them had gone in and wounded it, whereon it sprang\nupon him and struck him down; that then the lord Leo had engaged it\nwhile the man escaped, and was also struck down, after which, rolling\nwith it on the ground, he stabbed and slew the animal. That was all.\n\n\"No, not all,\" said Ayesha; \"for you forget, cowards that you are,\nthat, keeping yourselves in safety, you left my lord to the fury of this\nbeast. Good. Drive them out on to the Mountain, there to perish also at\nthe fangs of beasts, and make it known that he who gives them food or\nshelter dies.\"\n\nOffering no prayer for pity or excuse, the chief and his followers rose,\nbowed, and turned to go.\n\n\"Stay a moment, comrades,\" said Leo, \"and, chief, give me your arm;\nmy scratch grows stiff; I cannot walk fast. We will finish this hunt\ntogether.\"\n\n\"What doest thou? Art mad?\" asked Ayesha.\n\n\"I know not whether I am mad,\" he answered, \"but I know that thou\nart wicked and unjust. Look now, than these hunters none braver ever\nbreathed. That man\"--and he pointed to the one whom the leopard had\nstruck down--\"took my place and went in before me because I ordered that\nwe should attack the creature, and thus was felled. As thou seest all,\nthou mightest have seen this also. Then it sprang on me, and the rest of\nthese, my friends, ran round waiting a chance to strike, which at first\nthey could not do unless they would have killed me with it, since I\nand the brute rolled over and over in the snow. As it was, one of them\nseized it with his bare hands: look at the teeth marks on his arm. So if\nthey are to perish on the Mountain, I, who am the man to blame, perish\nwith them.\"\n\nNow, while the hunters looked at him with fervent gratitude in their\neyes, Ayesha thought a little, then said cleverly enough--\"In truth,\nmy lord Leo, had I known all the tale, well mightest thou have named\nme wicked and unjust; but I knew only what I saw, and out of their own\nmouths did I condemn them. My servants, my lord here has pleaded for\nyou, and you are forgiven; more, he who rushed in upon the leopard and\nhe who seized it with his hands shall be rewarded and advanced. Go; but\nI warn you if you suffer my lord to come into more danger, you shall not\nescape so easily again.\"\n\nSo they bowed and went, still blessing Leo with their eyes, since\ndeath by exposure on the Mountain snows was the most terrible form of\npunishment known to these people, and one only inflicted by the direct\norder of Hes upon murderers or other great criminals.\n\nWhen we had left the Sanctuary and were alone again in the hall, the\nstorm that I had seen gathering upon Leo's face broke in earnest. Ayesha\nrenewed her inquiries about his wounds, and wished to call Oros, the\nphysician, to dress them, and as he refused this, offered to do so\nherself. He begged that she would leave his wounds alone, and then, his\ngreat beard bristling with wrath, asked her solmenly if he was a child\nin arms, a query so absurd that I could not help laughing.\n\nThen he scolded her--yes, he scolded Ayesha! Wishing to know what she\nmeant (1) by spying upon him with her magic, an evil gift that he had\nalways disliked and mistrusted; (2) by condemning brave and excellent\nmen, his good friends, to a death of fiendish cruelty upon such\nevidence, or rather out of temper, on no evidence at all; and (3) by\ngiving him into charge of them, as though he were a little boy, and\ntelling them that they would have to answer for it if he were hurt: he\nwho, in his time, had killed every sort of big game known and passed\nthrough some perils and encounters?\n\nThus he beat her with his words, and, wonderful to say, Ayesha, this\nbeing more than woman, submitted to the chastisement meekly. Yet had any\nother man dared to address her with roughness even, I doubt not that his\nspeech and his life would have come to a swift and simultaneous end,\nfor I knew that now, as of old, she could slay by the mere effort of\nher will. But she did not slay; she did not even threaten, only, as any\nother loving woman might have done, she began to cry. Yes, great tears\ngathered in those lovely eyes of hers and, rolling one by one down her\nface, fell--for her head was bent humbly forward--like heavy raindrops\non the marble floor.\n\nAt the sight of this touching evidence of her human, loving heart all\nLeo's anger melted. Now it was he who grew penitent and prayed\nher pardon humbly. She gave him her hand in token of forgiveness,\nsaying--\"Let others speak to me as they will\" (sorry should I have been\nto try it!) \"but from thee, Leo, I cannot bear harsh words. Oh, thou art\ncruel, cruel. In what have I offended? Can I help it if my spirit keeps\nits watch upon thee, as indeed, though thou knewest it not, it has done\never since we parted yonder in the Place of Life? Can I help it if, like\nsome mother who sees her little child at play upon a mountain's edge, my\nsoul is torn with agony when I know thee in dangers that I am powerless\nto prevent or share? What are the lives of a few half-wild huntsmen that\nI should let them weigh for a single breath against thy safety, seeing\nthat if I slew these, others would be more careful of thee? Whereas if I\nslay them not, they or their fellows may even lead thee into perils that\nwould bring about--thy _death_,\" and she gasped with horror at the word.\n\n\"Listen, beloved,\" said Leo. \"The life of the humblest of those men is\nof as much value to him as mine is to me, and thou hast no more right to\nkill him than thou hast to kill me. It is evil that because thou carest\nfor me thou shouldst suffer thy love to draw thee into cruelty and\ncrime. If thou art afraid for me, then clothe me with that immortality\nof thine, which, although I dread it somewhat, holding it a thing\nunholy, and, on this earth, not permitted by my Faith, I should still\nrejoice to inherit for thy dear sake, knowing that then we could never\nmore be parted. Or, if as thou sayest, this as yet thou canst not do,\nthen let us be wed and take what fortune gives us. All men must die;\nbut at least before I die I shall have been happy with thee for a\nwhile--yes, if only for a single hour.\"\n\n\"Would that I dared,\" Ayesha answered with a little piteous motion of\nher hand. \"Oh! urge me no more, Leo, lest that at last I should take the\nrisk and lead thee down a dreadful road. Leo, hast thou never heard of\nthe love which slays, or of the poison that may lurk in a cup of joy too\nperfect?\"\n\nThen, as though she feared herself, Ayesha turned from him and fled.\n\nThus this matter ended. In itself it was not a great one, for Leo's\nhurts were mere scratches, and the hunters, instead of being killed,\nwere promoted to be members of his body-guard. Yet it told us many\nthings. For instance, that whenever she chose to do so, Ayesha had\nthe power of perceiving all Leo's movements from afar, and even of\ncommunicating her strength of mental vision to others, although to help\nhim in any predicament she appeared to have no power, which, of course,\naccounted for the hideous and ever-present might of her anxiety.\n\nThink what it would be to any one of us were we mysteriously acquainted\nwith every open danger, every risk of sickness, every secret peril\nthrough which our best-beloved must pass. To see the rock trembling to\nits fall and they loitering beneath it; to see them drink of water and\nknow it full of foulest poison; to see them embark upon a ship and be\naware that it was doomed to sink, but not to be able to warn them or to\nprevent them. Surely no mortal brain could endure such constant terrors,\nsince hour by hour the arrows of death flit unseen and unheard past the\nbreasts of each of us, till at length one finds its home there.\n\nWhat then must Ayesha have suffered, watching with her spirit's eyes all\nthe hair-breadth escapes of our journeyings? When, for instance, in the\nbeginning she saw Leo at my house in Cumberland about to kill himself\nin his madness and despair, and by some mighty effort of her superhuman\nwill, wrung from whatever Power it was that held her in its fearful\nthraldom, the strength to hurl her soul across the world and thereby in\nhis sleep reveal to him the secret of the hiding-place where he would\nfind her.\n\nOr to take one more example out of many--when she saw him hanging by\nthat slender thread of yak's hide from the face of the waterfall of ice\nand herself remained unable to save him, or even to look forward for\na single moment and learn whether or no he was about to meet a hideous\ndeath, in which event she must live on alone until in some dim age he\nwas born again.\n\nNor can her sorrows have ended with these more material fears, since\nothers as piercing must have haunted her. Imagine, for instance, the\nagonies of her jealous heart when she knew her lover to be exposed to\nthe temptations incident to his solitary existence, and more especially\nto those of her ancient rival Atene, who, by Ayesha's own account, had\nonce been his wife. Imagine also her fears lest time and human change\nshould do their natural work on him, so that by degrees the memory of\nher wisdom and her strength, and the image of her loveliness faded from\nhis thought, and with them his desire for her company; thus leaving her\nwho had endured so long, forgotten and alone at last.\n\nTruly, the Power that limited our perceptions did so in purest mercy,\nfor were it otherwise with us, our race would go mad and perish raving\nin its terrors.\n\nThus it would seem that Ayesha, great tormented soul, thinking to win\nlife and love eternal and most glorious, was in truth but another blind\nPandora. From her stolen casket of beauty and super-human power had\nleapt into her bosom, there to dwell unceasingly, a hundred torturing\ndemons, of whose wings mere mortal kind do but feel the far-off, icy\nshadowing.\n\nYes; and that the parallel might be complete, Hope alone still lingered\nin that rifled chest.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nAYESHA'S ALCHEMY\n\nIt was shortly after this incident of the snow-leopard that one of these\ndemon familiars of Ayesha's, her infinite ambition, made its formidable\nappearance. When we had dined with her in the evening, Ayesha's habit\nwas to discuss plans for our mighty and unending future, that awful\ninheritance which she had promised to us.\n\nHere I must explain, if I have not done so already, that she had\ngraciously informed me that notwithstanding my refusal in past years\nof such a priceless opportunity, I also was to be allowed to bathe my\nsuperannuated self in the vital fires, though in what guise I should\nemerge from them, like Herodotus when he treats of the mysteries of old\nEgypt, if she knew, she did not think it lawful to reveal.\n\nSecretly I hoped that my outward man might change for the better, as the\nprospect of being fixed for ever in the shape of my present and somewhat\nunpleasing personality, did not appeal to me as attractive. In truth, so\nfar as I was concerned, the matter had an academic rather than an actual\ninterest, such as we take in a fairy tale, since I did not believe that\nI should ever put on this kind of immortality. Nor, I may add, now as\nbefore, was I at all certain that I wished to do so.\n\nThese plans of Ayesha's were far reaching and indeed terrific.\nHer acquaintance with the modern world, its political and social\ndevelopments, was still strictly limited; for if she had the power to\nfollow its growth and activities, certainly it was one of which she made\nno use.\n\nIn practice her knowledge seemed to be confined to what she had gathered\nduring the few brief talks which took place between us upon this subject\nin past time at Kor. Now her thirst for information proved insatiable,\nalthough it is true that ours was scarcely up to date, seeing that ever\nsince we lost touch with the civilized peoples, namely, for the last\nfifteen years or so, we had been as much buried as she was herself.\n\nStill we were able to describe to her the condition of the nations and\ntheir affairs as they were at the period when we bade them farewell,\nand, more or less incorrectly, to draw maps of the various countries and\ntheir boundaries, over which she pondered long.\n\nThe Chinese were the people in whom she proved to be most interested,\nperhaps because she was acquainted with the Mongolian type, and like\nourselves, understood a good many of their dialects. Also she had a\nmotive for her studies, which one night she revealed to us in the most\nmatter-of-fact fashion.\n\nThose who have read the first part of her history, which I left in\nEngland to be published, may remember that when we found her at Kor,\n_She_ horrified us by expressing a determination to possess herself of\nGreat Britain, for the simple reason that we belonged to that country.\nNow, however, like her powers, her ideas had grown, for she purposed to\nmake Leo the absolute monarch of the world. In vain did he assure her\nmost earnestly that he desired no such empire. She merely laughed at him\nand said--\"If I arise amidst the Peoples, I must rule the Peoples, for\nhow can Ayesha take a second place among mortal men? And thou, my Leo,\nrulest me, yes, mark the truth, thou art my master! Therefore it is\nplain that thou wilt be the master of this earth, aye, and perchance of\nothers which do not yet appear, for of these also I know something, and,\nI think, can reach them if I will, though hitherto I have had no mind\nthat way. My true life has not yet begun. Its little space within this\nworld has been filled with thought and care for thee; in waiting till\nthou wast born again, and during these last years of separation, until\nthou didst return.\n\n\"But now a few more months, and the days of preparation past, endowed\nwith energy eternal, with all the wisdom of the ages, and with a\nstrength that can bend the mountains or turn the ocean from its bed,\nand we begin to be. Oh! how I sicken for that hour when first, like twin\nstars new to the firmament of heaven, we break in our immortal splendour\nupon the astonished sight of men. It will please me, I tell thee,\nLeo, it will please me, to see Powers, Principalities and Dominions,\nmarshalled by their kings and governors, bow themselves before our\nthrones and humbly crave the liberty to do our will. At least,\" she\nadded, \"it will please me for a little time, until we seek higher\nthings.\"\n\nSo she spoke, while the radiance upon her brow increased and spread\nitself, gleaming above her like a golden fan, and her slumbrous eyes\ntook fire from it till, to my thought, they became glowing mirrors in\nwhich I saw pomp enthroned and suppliant peoples pass.\n\n\"And how,\" asked Leo, with something like a groan--for this vision of\nuniversal rule viewed from afar did not seem to charm him--\"how, Ayesha,\nwilt thou bring these things about?\"\n\n\"How, my Leo? Why, easily enough. For many nights I have listened to\nthe wise discourses of our Holly here, at least he thinks them wise who\nstill has so much to learn, and pored over his crooked maps, comparing\nthem with those that are written in my memory, who of late have had\nno time for the study of such little matters. Also I have weighed and\npondered your reports of the races of this world; their various follies,\ntheir futile struggling for wealth and small supremacies, and I have\ndetermined that it would be wise and kind to weld them to one whole,\nsetting ourselves at the head of them to direct their destinies, and\ncause wars, sickness, and poverty to cease, so that these creatures of\na little day (ephemeridae was the word she used) may live happy from the\ncradle to the grave.\n\n\"Now, were it not because of thy strange shrinking from bloodshed,\nhowever politic and needful--for my Leo, as yet thou art no true\nphilosopher--this were quickly done, since I can command a weapon which\nwould crush their armouries and whelm their navies in the deep; yes, I,\nwhom even the lightnings and Nature's elemental powers must obey. But\nthou shrinkest from the sight of death, and thou believest that Heaven\nwould be displeased because I make myself--or am chosen--the instrument\nof Heaven. Well, so let it be, for thy will is mine, and therefore we\nwill tread a gentler path.\"\n\n\"And how wilt thou persuade the kings of the earth to place their crowns\nupon thy head?\" I asked, astonished.\n\n\"By causing their peoples to offer them to us,\" she answered suavely.\n\"Oh! Holly, Holly, how narrow is thy mind, how strained the quality of\nthine imagination! Set its poor gates ajar, I pray, and bethink thee.\nWhen we appear among men, scattering gold to satisfy their want, clad\nin terrifying power, in dazzling beauty and in immortality of days, will\nthey not cry, 'Be ye our monarchs and rule over us!'\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" I answered dubiously, \"but where wilt thou appear?\"\n\nShe took a map of the eastern hemisphere which I had drawn and, placing\nher finger upon Pekin, said--\"There is the place that shall be our home\nfor some few centuries, say three, or five, or seven, should it take so\nlong to shape this people to my liking and our purposes. I have\nchosen these Chinese because thou tellest me that their numbers are\nuncountable, that they are brave, subtle, and patient, and though now\npowerless because ill-ruled and untaught, able with their multitudes to\nflood the little western nations. Therefore among them we will begin our\nreign and for some few ages be at rest while they learn wisdom from us,\nand thou, my Holly, makest their armies unconquerable and givest their\nland good government, wealth, peace, and a new religion.\"\n\nWhat the new religion was to be I did not ask. It seemed unnecessary,\nsince I was convinced that in practice it would prove a form of\nAyesha-worship, Indeed, my mind was so occupied with conjectures, some\nof them quaint and absurd enough, as to what would happen at the first\nappearance of Ayesha in China that I forgot this subsidiary development\nof our future rule.\n\n\"And if the 'little western nations' will not wait to be flooded?\"\nsuggested Leo with irritation, for her contemptuous tone angered him,\none of a prominent western nation. \"If they combine, for instance, and\nattack thee first?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" she said, with a flash of her eyes. \"I have thought of it, and for\nmy part hope that it will chance, since then thou canst not blame me if\nI put out my strength. Oh! then the East, that has slept so long, shall\nawake--shall awake, and upon battlefield after battlefield such as\nhistory cannot tell of, thou shalt see my flaming standards sweep on to\nvictory. One by one thou shalt watch the nations fall and perish, until\nat length I build thy throne upon the hecatombs of their countless dead\nand crown thee emperor of a world regenerate in blood and fire.\"\n\nLeo, whom this new gospel of regeneration seemed to appall, who was,\nin fact, a hater of absolute monarchies and somewhat republican in his\nviews and sympathies, continued the argument, but I took no further\nheed. The thing was grotesque in its tremendous and fantastic absurdity;\nAyesha's ambitions were such as no imperial-minded madman could\nconceive.\n\nYet--here came the rub--I had not the slightest doubt but that she was\nwell able to put them into practice and carry them to some marvellous\nand awful conclusion. Why not? Death could not touch her; she had\ntriumphed over death. Her beauty--that \"cup of madness\" in her eyes, as\nshe named it once to me--and her reckless will would compel the hosts of\nmen to follow her. Her piercing intelligence would enable her to invent\nnew weapons with which the most highly-trained army could not possibly\ncompete. Indeed, it might be as she said, and as I for one believed,\nwith good reason, it proved, that she held at her command the elemental\nforces of Nature, such as those that lie hid in electricity, which would\ngive all living beings to her for a prey.\n\nAyesha was still woman enough to have worldly ambitions, and the most\ndread circumstance about her superhuman powers was that they appeared to\nbe unrestrained by any responsibility to God or man. She was as we might\nwell imagine a fallen angel to be, if indeed, as she herself once hinted\nand as Atene and the old Shaman believed, this were not her true place\nin creation. By only two things that I was able to discover could she be\nmoved--her love for Leo and, in a very small degree, her friendship for\nmyself.\n\nYet her devouring passion for this one man, inexplicable in its\nendurance and intensity, would, I felt sure even then, in the future as\nin the past, prove to be her heel of Achilles. When Ayesha was dipped in\nthe waters of Dominion and Deathlessness, this human love left her heart\nmortal, that through it she might be rendered harmless as a child, who\notherwise would have devastated the universe.\n\nI was right.\n\nWhilst I was still indulging myself in these reflections and hoping\nthat Ayesha would not take the trouble to read them in my mind, I became\naware that Oros was bowing to the earth before her.\n\n\"Thy business, priest?\" she asked sharply; for when she was with Leo\nAyesha did not like to be disturbed.\n\n\"Hes, the spies are returned.\"\n\n\"Why didst thou send them out?\" she asked indifferently. \"What need have\nI of thy spies?\"\n\n\"Hes, thou didst command me.\"\n\n\"Well, their report?\"\n\n\"Hes, it is most grave. The people of Kaloon are desperate because of\nthe drought which has caused their crops to fail, so that starvation\nstares them in the eyes, and this they lay to the charge of the\nstrangers who came into their land and fled to thee. The Khania Atene\nalso is mad with rage against thee and our holy College. Labouring night\nand day, she has gathered two great armies, one of forty, and one of\ntwenty thousand men, and the latter of these she sends against the\nMountain under the command of her uncle, Simbri the Shaman. In case it\nshould be defeated she purposes to remain with the second and greater\narmy on the plains about Kaloon.\"\n\n\"Tidings indeed,\" said Ayesha with a scornful laugh. \"Has her hate\nmade this woman mad that she dares thus to match herself against me? My\nHolly, it crossed thy mind but now that it was I who am mad, boasting\nof what I have no power to perform. Well, within six days thou shalt\nlearn--oh! verily thou shalt learn, and, though the issue be so very\nsmall, in such a fashion that thou wilt doubt no more for ever. Stay,\nI will look, though the effort of it wearies me, for those spies may be\nbut victims to their own fears, or to the falsehoods of Atene.\"\n\nThen suddenly, as was common with her when thus Ayesha threw her sight\nafar, which either from indolence, or because, as she said, it exhausted\nher, she did but rarely, her lovely face grew rigid like that of a\nperson in a trance; the light faded from her brow, and the great pupils\nof her eyes contracted themselves and lost their colour.\n\nIn a little while, five minutes perhaps, she sighed like one awakening\nfrom a deep sleep, passed her hand across her forehead and was as she\nhad been, though somewhat languid, as though strength had left her.\n\n\"It is true enough,\" she said, \"and soon I must be stirring lest many\nof my people should be killed. My lord, wouldst thou see war? Nay,\nthou shalt bide here in safety whilst I go forward--to visit Atene as I\npromised.\"\n\n\"Where thou goest, I go,\" said Leo angrily, his face flushing to the\nroots of his hair with shame.\n\n\"I pray thee not, I pray thee not,\" she answered, yet without venturing\nto forbid him. \"We will talk of it hereafter. Oros, away! Send round the\nFire of Hes to every chief. Three nights hence at the moonrise bid\nthe Tribes gather--nay, not all, twenty thousand of their best will be\nenough, the rest shall stay to guard the Mountain and this Sanctuary.\nLet them bring food with them for fifteen days. I join them at the\nfollowing dawn. Go.\"\n\nHe bowed and went, whereon, dismissing the matter from her mind, Ayesha\nbegan to question me again about the Chinese and their customs.\n\nIt was in course of a somewhat similar conversation on the following\nnight, of which, however, I forget the exact details, that a remark of\nLeo's led to another exhibition of Ayesha's marvellous powers.\n\nLeo--who had been considering her plans for conquest, and again\ncombating them as best he could, for they were entirely repugnant to his\nreligious, social and political views--said suddenly that after all they\nmust break down, since they would involve the expenditure of sums of\nmoney so vast that even Ayesha herself would be unable to provide\nthem by any known methods of taxation. She looked at him and laughed a\nlittle.\n\n\"Verily, Leo,\" she said, \"to thee, yes; and to Holly here I must seem as\nsome madcap girl blown to and fro by every wind of fancy, and building\nme a palace wherein to dwell out of dew and vapours, or from the\nsubstance of the sunset fires. Thinkest thou then that I would enter on\nthis war--one woman against all the world\"--and as she spoke her shape\ngrew royal and in her awful eyes there came a look that chilled my\nblood--\"and make no preparation for its necessities? Why, since last we\nspoke upon this matter, foreseeing all, I have considered in my mind,\nand now thou shalt learn how, without cost to those we rule--and for\nthat reason alone shall they love us dearly--I will glut the treasuries\nof the Empress of the Earth.\n\n\"Dost remember, Leo, how in Kor I found but a single pleasure during all\nthose weary ages--that of forcing my mother Nature one by one to yield\nme up her choicest secrets; I, who am a student of all things which are\nand of the forces that cause them to be born. Now follow me, both of\nyou, and ye shall look on what mortal eyes have not yet beheld.\"\n\n\"What are we to see?\" I asked doubtfully, having a lively recollection\nof Ayesha's powers as a chemist.\n\n\"That thou shalt learn, or shalt not learn if it pleases thee to stay\nbehind. Come, Leo, my love, my love, and leave this wise philosopher\nfirst to find his riddle and next to guess it.\"\n\nThen turning her back to me she smiled on him so sweetly that although\nreally he was more loth to go than I, Leo would have followed her\nthrough a furnace door, as indeed, had he but known it, he was about to\ndo.\n\nSo they started, and I accompanied them since with Ayesha it was\nuseless to indulge in any foolish pride, or to make oneself a victim to\nconsistency. Also I was anxious to see her new marvel, and did not care\nto rely for an account of it upon Leo's descriptive skill, which at its\nbest was never more than moderate.\n\nShe took us down passages that we had not passed before, to a door which\nshe signed to Leo to open. He obeyed, and from the cave within issued a\nflood of light. As we guessed at once, the place was her laboratory,\nfor about it stood metal flasks and various strange-shaped instruments.\nMoreover, there was a furnace in it, one of the best conceivable, for it\nneeded neither fuel nor stoking, whose gaseous fires, like those of the\ntwisted columns in the Sanctuary, sprang from the womb of the volcano\nbeneath our feet.\n\nWhen we entered two priests were at work there: one of them stirring a\ncauldron with an iron rod and the other receiving its molten contents\ninto a mould of clay. They stopped to salute Ayesha, but she bade them\nto continue their task, asking them if all went well.\n\n\"Very well, O Hes,\" they answered; and we passed through that cave and\nsundry doors and passages to a little chamber cut in the rock. There\nwas no lamp or flame of fire in it, and yet the place was filled with a\ngentle light which seemed to flow from the opposing wall.\n\n\"What were those priests doing?\" I said, more to break the silence than\nfor any other reason.\n\n\"Why waste breath upon foolish questions?\" she replied. \"Are no metals\nsmelted in thy country, O Holly? Now hadst thou sought to know what I am\ndoing--But that, without seeing, thou wouldst not believe, so, Doubter,\nthou shalt see.\"\n\nThen she pointed to and bade us don, two strange garments that hung upon\nthe wall, made of a material which seemed to be half cloth and half wood\nand having headpieces not unlike a diver's helmet.\n\nSo under her directions Leo helped me into mine, lacing it up behind,\nafter which, or so I gathered from the sounds--for no light came through\nthe helmet--she did the same service for him.\n\n\"I seem very much in the dark,\" I said presently; for now there was\nsilence again, and beneath this extinguisher I felt alarmed and wished\nto be sure that I was not left alone.\n\n\"Aye Holly,\" I heard Ayesha's mocking voice make answer, \"in the dark,\nas thou wast ever, the thick dark of ignorance and unbelief. Well, now,\nas ever also, I will give thee light.\" As she spoke I heard something\nroll back; I suppose that it must have been a stone door.\n\nThen, indeed, there was light, yes, even through the thicknesses of that\nprepared garment, such light as seemed to blind me. By it I saw that the\nwall opposite to us had opened and that we were all three of us, on the\nthreshold of another chamber. At the end of it stood something like\na little altar of hard, black stone, and on this altar lay a mass of\nsubstance of the size of a child's head, but fashioned, I suppose from\nfantasy, to the oblong shape of a human eye.\n\nOut of this eye there poured that blistering and intolerable light. It\nwas shut round by thick, funnel-shaped screens of a material that looked\nlike fire-brick, yet it pierced them as though they were but muslin.\nMore, the rays thus directed upwards struck full upon a lump of metal\nheld in place above them by a massive frame-work.\n\nAnd what rays they were! If all the cut diamonds of the world were\nbrought together and set beneath a mighty burning-glass, the light\nflashed from them would not have been a thousandth part so brilliant.\nThey scorched my eyes and caused the skin of my face and limbs to smart,\nyet Ayesha stood there unshielded from them. Aye, she even went down the\nlength of the room and, throwing back her veil, bent over them, as it\nseemed a woman of molten steel in whose body the bones were visible, and\nexamined the mass that was supported by the hanging cradle.\n\n\"It is ready and somewhat sooner than I thought,\" she said. Then as\nthough it were but a feather weight, she lifted the lump in her\nbare hands and glided back with it to where we stood, laughing and\nsaying--\"Tell me now, O thou well-read Holly, if thou hast ever heard of\na better alchemist than this poor priestess of a forgotten faith?\" And\nshe thrust the glowing substance up almost to the mask that hid my face.\n\nThen I turned and ran, or rather waddled, for in that gear I could not\nrun, out of the chamber until the rock wall beyond stayed me, and there,\nwith my back towards her, thrust my helmeted head against it, for I felt\nas though red-hot bradawls had been plunged into my eyes. So I stood\nwhile she laughed and mocked behind me until at length I heard the door\nclose and the blessed darkness came like a gift from Heaven.\n\nThen Ayesha began to loose Leo from his ray-proof armour, if so it can\nbe called, and he in turn loosed me; and there in that gentle radiance\nwe stood blinking at each other like owls in the sunlight, while the\ntears streamed down our faces.\n\n\"Well, art satisfied, my Holly?\" she asked.\n\n\"Satisfied with what?\" I answered angrily, for the smarting of my\neyes was unbearable. \"Yes, with burnings and bedevilments I am well\nsatisfied.\"\n\n\"And I also,\" grumbled Leo, who was swearing softly but continuously to\nhimself in the other corner of the place.\n\nBut Ayesha only laughed, oh! she laughed until she seemed the goddess\nof all merriment come to earth, laughed till she also wept, then\nsaid--\"Why, what ingratitude is this? Thou, my Leo, didst wish to see\nthe wonders that I work, and thou, O Holly, didst come unbidden after I\nbade thee stay behind, and now both of you are rude and angry, aye, and\nweeping like a child with a burnt finger. Here take this,\" and she gave\nus some salve that stood upon a shelf, \"and rub it on your eyes and the\nsmart will pass away.\"\n\nSo we did, and the pain went from them, though, for hours afterwards,\nmine remained red as blood.\n\n\"And what are these wonders?\" I asked her presently. \"If thou meanest\nthat unbearable flame----\"\n\n\"Nay, I mean what is born of the flame, as, in thine ignorance thou dost\ncall that mighty agent. Look now;\" and she pointed to the metallic lump\nshe had brought with her, which, still gleaming faintly, lay upon the\nfloor. \"Nay, it has no heat. Thinkest thou that I would wish to burn my\ntender hands and so make them unsightly? Touch it, Holly.\"\n\nBut I would not, who thought to myself that Ayesha might be well\naccustomed to the hottest fires, and feared her impish mischief. I\nlooked, however, long and earnestly.\n\n\"Well, what is it, Holly?\"\n\n\"Gold,\" I said, then corrected myself and added, \"Copper,\" for the dull,\nred glow might have been that of either metal.\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" she answered, \"it is gold, pure gold.\"\n\n\"The ore in this place must be rich,\" said Leo, incredulously, for I\nwould not speak any more.\n\n\"Yes, my Leo, the iron ore is rich.\"\n\n\"Iron ore?\" and he looked at her.\n\n\"Surely,\" she answered, \"for from what mine do men dig out gold in such\ngreat masses? Iron ore, beloved, that by my alchemy I change to gold,\nwhich soon shall serve us in our need.\"\n\nNow Leo stared and I groaned, for I did not believe that it was gold,\nand still less that she could make that metal. Then, reading my thought,\nwith one of those sudden changes of mood that were common to her, Ayesha\ngrew very angry.\n\n\"By Nature's self!\" she cried; \"wert thou not my friend, Holly, the fool\nwhom it pleases me to cherish, I would bind that right hand of thine\nin those secret rays till the very bones within it were turned to gold.\nNay, why should I be vexed with thee, who art both blind and deaf?\nYet thou _shalt_ be persuaded,\" and leaving us, she passed down the\npassages, called something to the priests who were labouring in the\nworkshop, then returned to us.\n\nPresently they followed her, carrying on a kind of stretcher between\nthem an ingot of iron ore that seemed to be as much as they could lift.\n\n\"Now,\" she said, \"how wilt thou that I mark this mass which as thou must\nadmit is only iron? With the sign of Life? Good,\" and at her bidding the\npriests took cold-chisels and hammers and roughly cut upon its surface\nthe symbol of the looped cross--the _crux ansata_.\n\n\"It is not enough,\" she said when they had finished. \"Holly, lend me\nthat knife of thine, to-morrow I will return it to thee, and of more\nvalue.\"\n\nSo I drew my hunting knife, an Indian-made thing, that had a handle of\nplated iron, and gave it her.\n\n\"Thou knowest the marks on it,\" and she pointed to various dents and to\nthe maker's name upon the blade; for though the hilt was Indian work the\nsteel was of Sheffield manufacture.\n\nI nodded. Then she bade the priests put on the ray-proof armour that\nwe had discarded, and told us to go without the chamber and lie in the\ndarkness of the passage with our faces against the floor.\n\nThis we did, and remained so until, a few minutes later, she called us\nagain. We rose and returned into the chamber to find the priests, who\nhad removed the protecting garments, gasping and rubbing the salve upon\ntheir eyes; to find also that the lump of iron ore and my knife were\ngone. Next she commanded them to place the block of gold-coloured metal\nupon their stretcher and to bring it with them. They obeyed, and we\nnoted that, although those priests were both of them strong men they\ngroaned beneath its weight.\n\n\"How came it,\" said Leo, \"that thou, a woman, couldst carry what these\nmen find so heavy?\"\n\n\"It is one of the properties of that force which thou callest fire,\" she\nanswered sweetly, \"to make what has been exposed to it, if for a little\nwhile only, as light as thistle-down. Else, how could I, who am so\nfrail, have borne yonder block of gold?\"\n\n\"Quite so! I understand now,\" answered Leo.\n\nWell, that was the end of it. The lump of metal was hid away in a kind\nof rock pit, with an iron cover, and we returned to Ayesha's apartments.\n\n\"So all wealth is thine, as well as all power,\" said Leo, presently, for\nremembering Ayesha's awful threat I scarcely dared to open my mouth.\n\n\"It seems so,\" she answered wearily, \"since centuries ago I discovered\nthat great secret, though until ye came I had put it to no use. Holly\nhere, after his common fashion, believes that this is magic, but I tell\nthee again that there is no magic, only knowledge which I have chanced\nto win.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Leo, \"looked at in the right way, that is in thy way,\nthe thing is simple.\" I think he would have liked to add, \"as lying,\"\nbut as the phrase would have involved explanations, did not. \"Yet,\nAyesha,\" he went on, \"hast thou thought that this discovery of thine\nwill wreck the world?\"\n\n\"Leo,\" she answered, \"is there then nothing that I can do which will\nnot wreck this world, for which thou hast such tender care, who shouldst\nkeep all thy care--for me?\"\n\nI smiled, but remembering in time, turned the smile into a frown at\nLeo, then fearing lest that also might anger her, made my countenance as\nblank as possible.\n\n\"If so,\" she continued, \"well, let the world be wrecked. But what\nmeanest thou? Oh! my lord, Leo, forgive me if I am so dull that I cannot\nalways follow thy quick thought--I who have lived these many years\nalone, without converse with nobler minds, or even those to which mine\nown is equal.\"\n\n\"It pleases thee to mock me,\" said Leo, in a vexed voice, \"and that is\nnot too brave.\"\n\nNow Ayesha turned on him fiercely, and I looked towards the door. But\nhe did not shrink, only folded his arms and stared her straight in\nthe face. She contemplated him a little, then said--\"After that great\nordained reason which thou dost not know, I think, Leo, that why I love\nthee so madly is that thou alone art not afraid of me. Not like Holly\nthere, who, ever since I threatened to turn his bones to gold--which,\nindeed, I was minded to do,\" and she laughed--\"trembles at my footsteps\nand cowers beneath my softest glance.\n\n\"Oh! my lord, how good thou art to me, how patient with my moods and\nwoman's weaknesses,\" and she made as though she were about to embrace\nhim. Then suddenly remembering herself, with a little start that somehow\nconveyed more than the most tragic gesture, she pointed to the couch\nin token that he should seat himself. When he had done so she drew a\nfootstool to his feet and sank upon it, looking up into his face with\nattentive eyes, like a child who listens for a story.\n\n\"Thy reasons, Leo, give me thy reasons. Doubtless they are good, and,\noh! be sure I'll weigh them well.\"\n\n\"Here they are in brief,\" he answered. \"The world, as thou knewest in\nthy--\" and he stopped.\n\n\"Thy earlier wanderings there,\" she suggested.\n\n\"Yes--thy earlier wanderings there, has set up gold as the standard of\nits wealth. On it all civilizations are founded. Make it as common as it\nseems thou canst, and these must fall to pieces. Credit will fail and,\nlike their savage forefathers, men must once more take to barter to\nsupply their needs as they do in Kaloon to-day.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" she asked. \"It would be more simple and bring them closer to\nthe time when they were good and knew not luxury and greed.\"\n\n\"And smashed in each other's heads with stone axes,\" added Leo.\n\n\"Who now pierce each other's hearts with steel, or those leaden missiles\nof which thou hast told me. Oh! Leo, when the nations are beggared and\ntheir golden god is down; when the usurer and the fat merchant tremble\nand turn white as chalk because their hoards are but useless dross;\nwhen I have made the bankrupt Exchanges of the world my mock, and laugh\nacross the ruin of its richest markets, why, then, will not true worth\ncome to its heritage again?\n\n\"What of it if I do discomfort those who think more of pelf than of\ncourage and of virtue; those who, as that Hebrew prophet wrote, lay\nfield to field and house to house, until the wretched whom they have\nrobbed find no place left whereon to dwell? What if I proved your sagest\nchapmen fools, and gorge your greedy moneychangers with the gold that\nthey desire until they loathe its very sight and touch? What if I uphold\nthe cause of the poor and the oppressed against the ravening lusts of\nMammon? Why, will not this world of yours be happier then?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" answered Leo. \"All that I know is that it would be a\ndifferent world, one shaped upon a new plan, governed by untried laws\nand seeking other ends. In so strange a place who can say what might or\nmight not chance?\"\n\n\"That we shall learn in its season, Leo. Or, rather, if it be against\nthy wish, we will not turn this hidden page. Since thou dost desire it,\nthat old evil, the love of lucre, shall still hold its mastery upon the\nearth. Let the peoples keep their yellow king, I'll not crown another\nin his place, as I was minded--such as that living Strength thou sawest\nburning eternally but now; that Power whereof I am the mistress, which\ncan give health to men, or even change the character of metals, and in\ntruth, if I so desire, obedient to my word, destroy a city or rend this\nMountain from its roots.\n\n\"But see, Holly is wearied with much wondering and needs his rest. Oh,\nHolly! thou wast born a critic of things done, not a doer of them. I\nknow thy tribe for even in my day the colleges of Alexandria echoed with\ntheir wranglings and already the winds blew thick with the dust of their\nforgotten bones. Holly, I tell thee that at times those who create and\nact are impatient of such petty doubts and cavillings. Yet fear not, old\nfriend, nor take my anger ill. Already thy heart is gold without alloy,\nso what need have I to gild thy bones?\"\n\nI thanked Ayesha for her compliment, and went to my bed wondering which\nwas real, her kindness or her wrath, or if both were but assumed. Also\nI wondered in what way she had fallen foul of the critics of Alexandria.\nPerhaps once she had published a poem or a system of philosophy and been\nroughly handled by them! It is quite possible, only if Ayesha had ever\nwritten poetry I think that it would have endured, like Sappho's.\n\nIn the morning I discovered that whatever else about her might be false,\nAyesha was a true chemist, the very greatest, I suppose, who ever\nlived. For as I dressed myself, those priests whom we had seen in\nthe laboratory, staggered into the room carrying between them a heavy\nburden, that was covered with a cloth, and, directed by Oros, placed it\nupon the floor.\n\n\"What is that?\" I asked of Oros.\n\n\"A peace-offering sent by the Hesea,\" he said, \"with whom, as I am told,\nyou dared to quarrel yesterday.\"\n\nThen he withdrew the cloth, and there beneath it shone that great lump\nof metal which, in the presence of myself and Leo, had been marked with\nthe Symbol of Life, that still appeared upon its surface. Only now it\nwas gold, not iron, gold so good and soft that I could write my name\nupon it with a nail. My knife lay with it also, and of that too the\nhandle, though not the blade, had been changed from iron into gold.\n\nAyesha asked to see this afterwards and was but ill-pleased with the\nresult of her experiment. She pointed out to me that lines and blotches\nof gold ran for an inch or more down the substance of the steel, which\nshe feared that they might weaken or distemper, whereas it had been her\npurpose that the hilt only should be altered.[*]\n\n     [*] I proved in after days how real were Ayesha's alchemy,\n     and the knowledge which enabled her to solve the secret that\n     chemists have hunted for in vain, and, like Nature's self,\n     to transmute the commonest into the most precious of the\n     metals. At the first town that I reached on the frontiers of\n     India, I took this knife to a jeweller, a native, who was as\n     clever as he proved dishonest, and asked him to test the\n     handle. He did so with acids and by other means, and told me\n     that it was of very pure gold, twenty-four carats, I think\n     he said. Also he pointed out that this gold became gradually\n     merged into the steel of the blade in a way which was quite\n     inexplicable to him, and asked me to clear up the matter. Of\n     course I could not, but at his request I left the knife in\n     his shop to give him an opportunity of examining it further.\n     The next day I was taken ill with one of the heart-attacks\n     to which I have been liable of late, and when I became able\n     to move about again a while afterwards, I found that this\n     jeweller had gone, none knew whither. So had my knife.--L.\n     H. H.\n\nOften since that time I have marvelled how Ayesha performed this\nmiracle, and from what substances she gathered or compounded the\nlightning-like material, which was her servant in the work; also,\nwhether or no it had been impregnated with the immortalizing fire of\nLife that burned in the caves of Kor.[*] Yet to this hour I have found\nno answer to the problem, for it is beyond my guessing.\n\n     [*] Recent discoveries would appear to suggest that this\n     mysterious \"Fire of Life,\" which, whatever else it may have\n     been, was evidently a force and no true fire, since it did\n     not burn, owed its origin to the emanations from radium, or\n     some kindred substance. Although in the year 1885, Mr. Holly\n     would have known nothing of the properties of these\n     marvellous rays or emanations, doubtless Ayesha was familiar\n     with them and their enormous possibilities, of which our\n     chemists and scientific men have, at present, but explored\n     the fringe.--Editor.\n\nI suppose that, in preparation for her conquest of the inhabitants of\nthis globe--to which, indeed, it would have sufficed unaided by any\nother power--the manufacture of gold from iron went on in the cave\nunceasingly.\n\nHowever this may be, during the few days that we remained together\nAyesha never so much as spoke of it again. It seemed to have served her\npurpose for the while, or in the press of other and more urgent matters\nto have been forgotten or thrust from her mind. Still, amongst others,\nof which I have said nothing, since it is necessary to select, I record\nthis strange incident, and our conversations concerning it at length,\nfor the reason that it made a great impression upon me and furnishes a\nstriking example of Ayesha's dominion over the hidden forces of Nature\nwhereof we were soon to experience a more fearful instance.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nTHE PROPHECY OF ATENE\n\nOn the day following this strange experience of the iron that was turned\nto gold some great service was held in the Sanctuary, as we understood,\n\"to consecrate the war.\" We did not attend it, but that night we ate\ntogether as usual. Ayesha was moody at the meal, that is, she varied\nfrom sullenness to laughter.\n\n\"Know you,\" she said, \"that to-day I was an Oracle, and those fools of\nthe Mountain sent their medicine-men to ask of the Hesea how the battle\nwould go and which of them would be slain, and which gain honour. And\nI--I could not tell them, but juggled with my words, so that they might\ntake them as they would. How the battle will go I know well, for I\nshall direct it, but the future--ah! that I cannot read better than thou\ncanst, my Holly, and that is ill indeed. For me the past and all the\npresent lie bathed in light reflected from that black wall--the future.\"\n\nThen she fell to brooding, and looking up at length with an air of\nentreaty, said to Leo--\"Wilt thou not hear my prayer and bide where thou\nart for some few days, or even go a-hunting? Do so, and I will stay with\nthee, and send Holly and Oros to command the Tribes in this petty fray.\"\n\n\"I will not,\" answered Leo, trembling with indignation, for this plan\nof hers that I should be sent out to war, while he bided in safety in a\ntemple, moved him, a man brave to rashness, who, although he disapproved\nof it in theory, loved fighting for its own sake also, to absolute rage.\n\n\"I say, Ayesha, that I will not,\" he repeated; \"moreover, that if thou\nleavest me here I will find my way down the mountain alone, and join the\nbattle.\"\n\n\"Then come,\" she answered, \"and on thine own head be it. Nay, not on\nthine beloved, on mine, on mine.\"\n\nAfter this, by some strange reaction, she became like a merry girl,\nlaughing more than I have ever seen her do, and telling us many tales of\nthe far, far past, but none that were sad or tragic. It was very strange\nto sit and listen to her while she spoke of people, one or two of them\nknown as names in history and many others who never have been heard\nof, that had trod this earth and with whom she was familiar over two\nthousand years ago. Yet she told us anecdotes of their loves and hates,\ntheir strength or weaknesses, all of them touched with some tinge of\nhumorous satire, or illustrating the comic vanity of human aims and\naspirations.\n\nAt length her talk took a deeper and more personal note. She spoke of\nher searchings after truth; of how, aching for wisdom, she had explored\nthe religions of her day and refused them one by one; of how she had\npreached in Jerusalem and been stoned by the Doctors of the Law. Of\nhow also she had wandered back to Arabia and, being rejected by her own\npeople as a reformer, had travelled on to Egypt, and at the court of the\nPharaoh of that time met a famous magician, half charlatan and half\nseer who, because she was far-seeing, 'clairvoyante' we should call it,\ninstructed her in his art so well that soon she became his master and\nforced him to obey her.\n\nThen, as though she were unwilling to reveal too much, suddenly Ayesha's\nhistory passed from Egypt to Kor. She spoke to Leo of his arrival there,\na wanderer who was named Kallikrates, hunted by savages and accompanied\nby the Egyptian Amenartas, whom she appeared to have known and hated in\nher own country, and of how she entertained them. Yes, she even told of\na supper that the three of them had eaten together on the evening before\nthey started to discover the Place of Life, and of an evil prophecy that\nthis royal Amenartas had made as to the issue of their journey.\n\n\"Aye,\" Ayesha said, \"it was such a silent night as this and such a\nmeal as this we ate, and Leo, not so greatly changed, save that he was\nbeardless then and younger, was at my side. Where thou sittest, Holly,\nsat the royal Amenartas, a very fair woman; yes, even more beautiful\nthan I before I dipped me in the Essence, fore-sighted also, though not\nso learned as I had grown. From the first we hated each other, and more\nthan ever now, when she guessed how I had learned to look upon thee, her\nlover, Leo; for her husband thou never wast, who didst flee too fast for\nmarriage. She knew also that the struggle between us which had begun of\nold and afar was for centuries and generations, and that until the end\nshould declare itself neither of us could harm the other, who both had\nsinned to win thee, that wast appointed by fate to be the lodestone\nof our souls. Then Amenartas spoke and said--\"'Lo! to my sight,\nKallikrates, the wine in thy cup is turned to blood, and that knife in\nthy hand, O daughter of Yarab'--for so she named me--'drips red blood.\nAye, and this place is a sepulchre, and thou, O Kallikrates, sleepest\nhere, nor can she, thy murderess, kiss back the breath of life into\nthose cold lips of thine.'\n\n\"So indeed it came about as was ordained,\" added Ayesha reflectively,\n\"for I slew thee in yonder Place of Life, yes, in my madness I slew thee\nbecause thou wouldst not or couldst not understand the change that had\ncome over me, and shrankest from my loveliness like a blind bat from\nthe splendour of flame, hiding thy face in the tresses of her dusky\nhair--Why, what is it now, thou Oros? Can I never be rid of thee for an\nhour?\"\n\n\"O Hes, a writing from the Khania Atene,\" the priest said with his\ndeprecating bow.\n\n\"Break the seal and read,\" she answered carelessly. \"Perchance she has\nrepented of her folly and makes submission.\"\n\nSo he read--\n\n\"To the Hesea of the College on the Mountain, known as Ayesha upon\nearth, and in the household of the Over-world whence she has been\npermitted to wander, as 'Star-that-hath-fallen--'\"\n\n\n\"A pretty sounding name, forsooth,\" broke in Ayesha; \"ah! but, Atene,\nset stars rise again--even from the Under-world. Read on, thou Oros.\"\n\n\n\"Greetings, O Ayesha. Thou who art very old, hast gathered much wisdom\nin the passing of the centuries, and with other powers, that of making\nthyself seem fair in the eyes of men blinded by thine arts. Yet one\nthing thou lackest that I have--vision of those happenings which are not\nyet. Know, O Ayesha, that I and my uncle, the great seer, have searched\nthe heavenly books to learn what is written there of the issue of this\nwar.\n\n\"This is written:--For me, death, whereat I rejoice. For thee a spear\ncast by thine own hand. For the land of Kaloon blood and ruin bred of\nthee!\n\n\"Atene,\n\n\"Khania of Kaloon.\"\n\n\nAyesha listened in silence, but her lips did not tremble, nor her cheek\npale. To Oros she said proudly--\"Say to the messenger of Atene that I\nhave received her message, and ere long will answer it, face to face\nwith her in her palace of Kaloon. Go, priest, and disturb me no more.\"\n\nWhen Oros had departed she turned to us and said--\"That tale of mine of\nlong ago was well fitted to this hour, for as Amenartas prophesied of\nill, so does Atene prophesy of ill, and Amenartas and Atene are one.\nWell, let the spear fall, if fall it must, and I will not flinch from\nit who know that I shall surely triumph at the last. Perhaps the Khania\ndoes but think to frighten me with a cunning lie, but if she has read\naright, then be sure, beloved, that it is still well with us, since none\ncan escape their destiny, nor can our bond of union which was fashioned\nwith the universe that bears us, ever be undone.\"\n\nShe paused awhile then went on with a sudden outburst of poetic thought\nand imagery.\n\n\"I tell thee, Leo, that out of the confusions of our lives and deaths\norder shall yet be born. Behind the mask of cruelty shine Mercy's\ntender eyes; and the wrongs of this rough and twisted world are but\nhot, blinding sparks which stream from the all-righting sword of pure,\neternal Justice. The heavy lives we see and know are only links in a\ngolden chain that shall draw us safe to the haven of our rest; steep\nand painful steps are they whereby we climb to the alloted palace of\nour joy. Henceforth I fear no more, and fight no more against that which\nmust befall. For I say we are but winged seeds blown down the gales of\nfate and change to the appointed garden where we shall grow, filling its\nblest air with the immortal fragrance of our bloom.\n\n\"Leave me now, Leo, and sleep awhile, for we ride at dawn.\"\n\nIt was midday on the morrow when we moved down the mountain-side with\nthe army of the Tribes, fierce and savage-looking men. The scouts were\nout before us, then came the great body of their cavalry mounted on wiry\nhorses, while to right and left and behind, the foot soldiers marched in\nregiments, each under the command of its own chief.\n\nAyesha, veiled now--for she would not show her beauty to these wild\nfolk--rode in the midst of the horse-men on a white mare of matchless\nspeed and shape. With her went Leo and myself, Leo on the Khan's black\nhorse, and I on another not unlike it, though thicker built. About us\nwere a bodyguard of armed priests and a regiment of chosen soldiers,\namong them those hunters that Leo had saved from Ayesha's wrath, and who\nwere now attached to his person.\n\nWe were merry, all of us, for in the crisp air of late autumn flooded\nwith sunlight, the fears and forebodings that had haunted us in those\ngloomy, firelit caves were forgotten. Moreover, the tramp of thousands\nof armed men and the excitement of coming battle thrilled our nerves.\n\nNot for many a day had I seen Leo look so vigorous and happy. Of late\nhe had grown somewhat thin and pale, probably from causes that I have\nsuggested, but now his cheeks were red and his eyes shone bright again.\nAyesha also seemed joyous, for the moods of this strange woman were as\nfickle as those of Nature's self, and varied as a landscape varies under\nthe sunshine or the shadow. Now she was noon and now dark night; now\ndawn, now evening, and now thoughts came and went in the blue depths of\nher eyes like vapours wafted across the summer sky, and in the press\nof them her sweet face changed and shimmered as broken water shimmers\nbeneath the beaming stars.\n\n\"Too long,\" she said, with a little thrilling laugh, \"have I been shut\nin the bowels of sombre mountains, accompanied only by mutes and savages\nor by melancholy, chanting priests, and now I am glad to look upon the\nworld again. How beautiful are the snows above, and the brown slopes\nbelow, and the broad plains beyond that roll away to those bordering\nhills! How glorious is the sun, eternal as myself; how sweet the keen\nair of heaven.\n\n\"Believe me, Leo, more than twenty centuries have gone by since I was\nseated on a steed, and yet thou seest I have not forgot my horsemanship,\nthough this beast cannot match those Arabs that I rode in the wide\ndeserts of Arabia. Oh! I remember how at my father's side I galloped\ndown to war against the marauding Bedouins, and how with my own hand I\nspeared their chieftain and made him cry for mercy. One day I will tell\nthee of that father of mine, for I was his darling, and though we have\nbeen long apart, I hold his memory dear and look forward to our meeting.\n\n\"See, yonder is the mouth of that gorge where lived the cat-worshipping\nsorcerer, who would have murdered both of you because thou, Leo, didst\nthrow his familiar to the fire. It is strange, but several of the tribes\nof this Mountain and of the lands behind it make cats their gods or\ndivine by means of them. I think that the first Rassen, the general\nof Alexander, must have brought the practice here from Egypt. Of\nthis Macedonian Alexander I could tell thee much, for he was almost a\ncontemporary of mine, and when I last was born the world still rang with\nthe fame of his great deeds.\n\n\"It was Rassen who on the Mountain supplanted the primeval fire-worship\nwhereof the flaming pillars which light its Sanctuary remain as\nmonuments, by that of Hes, or Isis, or rather blended the two in one.\nDoubtless among the priests in his army were some of Pasht or Sekket the\nCat-headed, and these brought with them their secret cult, that to-day\nhas dwindled down to the vulgar divinations of savage sorcerers. Indeed\nI remember dimly that it was so, for I was the first Hesea of this\nTemple, and journeyed hither with that same general Rassen, a relative\nof mine.\"\n\nNow both Leo and I looked at her wonderingly, and I could see that she\nwas watching us through her veil. As usual, however, it was I whom she\nreproved, since Leo might think and do what he willed and still escape\nher anger.\n\n\"Thou, Holly,\" she said quickly, \"who art ever of a cavilling and\nsuspicious mind, remembering what I said but now, believest that I lie\nto thee.\"\n\nI protested that I was only reflecting upon an apparent variation\nbetween two statements.\n\n\"Play not with words,\" she answered; \"in thy heart thou didst write me\ndown a liar, and I take that ill. Know, foolish man, that when I said\nthat the Macedonian Alexander lived before me, I meant before this\npresent life of mine. In the existence that preceded it, though I\noutlasted him by thirty years, we were born in the same summer, and\nI knew him well, for I was the Oracle whom he consulted most upon his\nwars, and to my wisdom he owed his victories. Afterwards we quarrelled,\nand I left him and pushed forward with Rassen. From that day the\nbright star of Alexander began to wane.\" At this Leo made a sound that\nresembled a whistle. In a very agony of apprehension, beating back the\ncriticisms and certain recollections of the strange tale of the old\nabbot, Kou-en, which would rise within me, I asked quickly--\"And dost\nthou, Ayesha, remember well all that befell thee in this former life?\"\n\n\"Nay, not well,\" she answered, meditatively, \"only the greater facts,\nand those I have for the most part recovered by that study of secret\nthings which thou callest vision or magic. For instance, my Holly, I\nrecall that thou wast living in that life. Indeed I seem to see an\nugly philosopher clad in a dirty robe and filled both with wine and the\nlearning of others, who disputed with Alexander till he grew wroth with\nhim and caused him to be banished, or drowned: I forget which.\"\n\n\"I suppose that I was not called Diogenes?\" I asked tartly, suspecting,\nperhaps not without cause, that Ayesha was amusing herself by fooling\nme.\n\n\"No,\" she replied gravely, \"I do not think that was thy name. The\nDiogenes thou speakest of was a much more famous man, one of real if\ncrabbed wisdom; moreover, he did not indulge in wine. I am mindful of\nvery little of that life, however, not of more indeed than are many of\nthe followers of the prophet Buddha, whose doctrines I have studied and\nof whom thou, Holly, hast spoken to me so much. Maybe we did not meet\nwhile it endured. Still I recollect that the Valley of Bones, where\nI found thee, my Leo, was the place where a great battle was fought\nbetween the Fire-priests with their vassals, the Tribes of the Mountain\nand the army of Rassen aided by the people of Kaloon. For between these\nand the Mountain, in old days as now, there was enmity, since in this\npresent war history does but rewrite itself.\"\n\n\"So thou thyself wast our guide,\" said Leo, looking at her sharply.\n\n\"Aye, Leo, who else? though it is not wonderful that thou didst not know\nme beneath those deathly wrappings. I was minded to wait and receive\nthee in the Sanctuary, yet when I learned that at length both of you had\nescaped Atene and drew near, I could restrain myself no more, but came\nforth thus hideously disguised. Yes, I was with you even at the river's\nbank, and though you saw me not, there sheltered you from harm.\n\n\"Leo, I yearned to look upon thee and to be certain that thy heart had\nnot changed, although until the alloted time thou mightest not hear my\nvoice or see my face who wert doomed to undergo that sore trial of thy\nfaith. Of Holly also I desired to learn whether his wisdom could pierce\nthrough my disguise, and how near he stood to truth. It was for this\nreason that I suffered him to see me draw the lock from the satchel on\nthy breast and to hear me wail over thee yonder in the Rest-house.\nWell he did not guess so ill, but thou, thou knewest me--in thy\nsleep--knewest me as I am, and not as I seemed to be, yes,\" she added\nsoftly, \"and didst say certain sweet words which I remember well.\"\n\n\"Then beneath that shroud was thine own face,\" asked Leo again, for he\nwas very curious on this point, \"the same lovely face I see to-day?\"\n\n\"Mayhap--as thou wilt,\" she answered coldly; \"also it is the spirit that\nmatters, not the outward seeming, though men in their blindness think\notherwise. Perchance my face is but as thy heart fashions it, or as my\nwill presents it to the sight and fancy of its beholders. But hark! The\nscouts have touched.\"\n\nAs Ayesha spoke a sound of distant shouting was borne upon the wind,\nand presently we saw a fringe of horsemen falling back slowly upon our\nforemost line. It was only to report, however, that the skirmishers of\nAtene were in full retreat. Indeed, a prisoner whom they brought with\nthem, on being questioned by the priests, confessed at once that the\nKhania had no mind to meet us upon the holy Mountain. She proposed to\ngive battle on the river's farther bank, having for a defence its waters\nwhich we must ford, a decision that showed good military judgment.\n\nSo it happened that on this day there was no fighting.\n\nAll that afternoon we descended the slopes of the Mountain, more swiftly\nby far than we had climbed them after our long flight from the city of\nKaloon. Before sunset we came to our prepared camping ground, a wide and\nsloping plain that ended at the crest of the Valley of Dead Bones, where\nin past days we had met our mysterious guide. This, however, we did not\nreach through the secret mountain tunnel along which she had led us, the\nshortest way by miles, as Ayesha told us now, since it was unsuited to\nthe passage of an army.\n\nBending to the left, we circled round a number of unclimbable koppies,\nbeneath which that tunnel passed, and so at length arrived upon the brow\nof the dark ravine where we could sleep safe from attack by night.\n\nHere a tent was pitched for Ayesha, but as it was the only one, Leo\nand I with our guard bivouacked among some rocks at a distance of a\nfew hundred yards. When she found that this must be so, Ayesha was very\nangry and spoke bitter words to the chief who had charge of the food and\nbaggage, although, he, poor man, knew nothing of tents.\n\nAlso she blamed Oros, who replied meekly that he had thought us captains\naccustomed to war and its hardships. But most of all she was angry with\nherself, who had forgotten this detail, and until Leo stopped her with a\nlaugh of vexation, went on to suggest that we should sleep in the tent,\nsince she had no fear of the rigours of the mountain cold.\n\nThe end of it was that we supped together outside, or rather Leo and I\nsupped, for as there were guards around us Ayesha did not even lift her\nveil.\n\nThat evening Ayesha was disturbed and ill at ease, as though new fears\nwhich she could not overcome assailed her. At length she seemed to\nconquer them by some effort of her will and announced that she was\nminded to sleep and thus refresh her soul; the only part of her, I\nthink, which ever needed rest. Her last words to us were--\"Sleep you\nalso, sleep sound, but be not astonished, my Leo, if I send to summon\nboth of you during the night, since in my slumbers I may find new\ncounsels and need to speak of them to thee ere we break camp at dawn.\"\n\nThus we parted, but ah! little did we guess how and where the three of\nus would meet again.\n\nWe were weary and soon fell fast asleep beside our camp-fire, for,\nknowing that the whole army guarded us, we had no fear. I remember\nwatching the bright stars which shone in the immense vault above me\nuntil they paled in the pure light of the risen moon, now somewhat past\nher full, and hearing Leo mutter drowsily from beneath his fur rug that\nAyesha was quite right, and that it was pleasant to be in the open air\nagain, as he was tired of caves.\n\nAfter that I knew no more until I was awakened by the challenge of a\nsentry in the distance; then after a pause, a second challenge from\nthe officer of our own guard. Another pause, and a priest stood bowing\nbefore us, the flickering light from the fire playing upon his shaven\nhead and face, which I seemed to recognize.\n\n\"I\"--and he gave a name that was familiar to me, but which I forget--\"am\nsent, my lords, by Oros, who commands me to say that the Hesea would\nspeak with you both and at once.\"\n\nNow Leo sat up yawning and asked what was the matter. I told him,\nwhereon he said he wished that Ayesha could have waited till daylight,\nthen added--\"Well, there is no help for it. Come on, Horace,\" and he\nrose to follow the messenger.\n\nThe priest bowed again and said--\"The commands of the Hesea are that my\nlords should bring their weapons and their guard.\"\n\n\"What,\" grumbled Leo, \"to protect us for a walk of a hundred yards\nthrough the heart of an army?\"\n\n\"The Hesea,\" explained the man, \"has left her tent; she is in the gorge\nyonder, studying the line of advance.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\" I asked.\n\n\"I do not know it,\" he replied. \"Oros told me so, that is all, and\ntherefore the Hesea bade my lords bring their guard, for she is alone.\"\n\n\"Is she mad,\" ejaculated Leo, \"to wander about in such a place at\nmidnight? Well, it is like her.\"\n\nI too thought it was like her, who did nothing that others would have\ndone, and yet I hesitated. Then I remembered that Ayesha had said she\nmight send for us; also I was sure that if any trick had been intended\nwe should not have been warned to bring an escort. So we called the\nguard--there were twelve of them--took our spears and swords and\nstarted.\n\nWe were challenged by both the first and second lines of sentries, and I\nnoticed that as we gave them the password the last picket, who of course\nrecognized us, looked astonished. Still, if they had doubts they did not\ndare to express them. So we went on.\n\nNow we began to descend the sides of the ravine by a very steep path,\nwith which the priest, our guide, seemed to be curiously familiar, for\nhe went down it as though it were the stairway of his own house.\n\n\"A strange place to take us to at night,\" said Leo doubtfully, when\nwe were near the bottom and the chief of the bodyguard, that great\nred-bearded hunter who had been mixed up in the matter of the\nsnow-leopard also muttered some words of remonstrance. Whilst I was\ntrying to catch what he said, of a sudden something white walked into\nthe patch of moonlight at the foot of the ravine, and we saw that it\nwas the veiled figure of Ayesha herself. The chief saw her also and said\ncontentedly--\"Hes! Hes!\"\n\n\"Look at her,\" grumbled Leo, \"strolling about in that haunted hole as\nthough it were Hyde Park;\" and on he went at a run.\n\nThe figure turned and beckoned to us to follow her as she glided\nforward, picking her way through the skeletons which were scattered\nabout upon the lava bed of the cleft. Thus she went on into the shadow\nof the opposing cliff that the moonlight did not reach. Here in the wet\nseason a stream trickled down a path which it had cut through the rock\nin the course of centuries, and the grit that it had brought with it\nwas spread about the lava floor of the ravine, so that many of the bones\nwere almost completely buried in the sand.\n\nThese, I noticed, as we stepped into the shadow, were more numerous than\nusual just here, for on all sides I saw the white crowns of skulls, or\nthe projecting ends of ribs and thigh bones. Doubtless, I thought to\nmyself, that streamway made a road to the plain above, and in some past\nbattle, the fighting around it was very fierce and the slaughter great.\n\nHere Ayesha had halted and was engaged in the contemplation of this\nboulder-strewn path, as though she meditated making use of it that day.\nNow we drew near to her, and the priest who guided us fell back with our\nguard, leaving us to go forward alone, since they dared not approach the\nHesea unbidden. Leo was somewhat in advance of me, seven or eight yards\nperhaps, and I heard him say--\"Why dost thou venture into such places at\nnight, Ayesha, unless indeed it is not possible for any harm to come to\nthee?\"\n\nShe made no answer, only turned and opened her arms wide, then let them\nfall to her side again. Whilst I wondered what this signal of hers might\nmean, from the shadows about us came a strange, rustling sound.\n\nI looked, and lo! everywhere the skeletons were rising from their sandy\nbeds. I saw their white skulls, their gleaming arm and leg bones, their\nhollow ribs. The long-slain army had come to life again, and look! in\ntheir hands were the ghosts of spears.\n\nOf course I knew at once that this was but another manifestation of\nAyesha's magic powers, which some whim of hers had drawn us from our\nbeds to witness. Yet I confess that I felt frightened. Even the boldest\nof men, however free from superstition, might be excused should their\nnerve fail them if, when standing in a churchyard at midnight, suddenly\non every side they saw the dead arising from their graves. Also our\nsurroundings were wilder and more eerie than those of any civilized\nburying-place.\n\n\"What new devilment of thine is this?\" cried Leo in a scared and angry\nvoice. But Ayesha made no answer. I heard a noise behind me and looked\nround. The skeletons were springing upon our body-guard, who for their\npart, poor men, paralysed with terror, had thrown down their weapons and\nfallen, some of them, to their knees. Now the ghosts began to stab at\nthem with their phantom spears, and I saw that beneath the blows they\nrolled over. The veiled figure above me pointed with her hand at Leo and\nsaid--\"Seize him, but I charge you, harm him not.\"\n\nI knew the voice; _it was that of Atene!_\n\nThen too late I understood the trap into which we had fallen.\n\n\"Treachery!\" I began to cry, and before the word was out of my lips, a\nparticularly able-bodied skeleton silenced me with a violent blow upon\nthe head. But though I could not speak, my senses still stayed with\nme for a little. I saw Leo fighting furiously with a number of men who\nstrove to pull him down, so furiously, indeed that his frightful efforts\ncaused the blood to gush out of his mouth from some burst vessel in the\nlungs.\n\nThen sight and hearing failed me, and thinking that this was death, I\nfell and remembered no more.\n\nWhy I was not killed outright I do not know, unless in their hurry the\ndisguised soldiers thought me already dead, or perhaps that my life was\nto be spared also. At least, beyond the knock upon the head I received\nno injury.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nTHE LOOSING OF THE POWERS\n\nWhen I came to myself again, it was daylight. I saw the calm, gentle\nface of Oros bending over me as he poured some strong fluid down my\nthroat that seemed to shoot through all my body, and melt a curtain in\nmy mind. I saw also that beside him stood Ayesha.\n\n\"Speak, man, speak,\" she said in a terrible voice. \"What hast chanced\nhere? Thou livest, then where is my lord? Where hast thou hid my lord?\nTell me--or die.\"\n\nIt was the vision that I saw when my senses left me in the snow of the\navalanche, fulfilled to the last detail!\n\n\"Atene has taken him,\" I answered.\n\n\"Atene has taken him and thou art left alive?\"\n\n\"Do not be wrath with me,\" I answered, \"it is no fault of mine. Little\nwonder we were deceived after thou hadst said that thou mightest summon\nus ere dawn.\"\n\nThen as briefly as I could I told the story.\n\nShe listened, went to where our murdered guards lay with unstained\nspears, and looked at them.\n\n\"Well for these that they are dead,\" she exclaimed. \"Now, Holly, thou\nseest what is the fruit of mercy. The men whose lives I gave my lord\nhave failed him at his need.\"\n\nThen she passed forward to the spot where Leo was captured. Here lay a\nbroken sword--Leo's--that had been the Khan Rassen's, and two dead men.\nBoth of these were clothed in some tight-fitting black garments, having\ntheir heads and faces whitened with chalk and upon their vests a rude\nimitation of a human skeleton, also daubed in chalk.\n\n\"A trick fit to frighten fools with,\" she said contemptuously. \"But oh!\nthat Atene should have dared to play the part of Ayesha, that she should\nhave dared!\" and she clenched her little hand. \"See, surprised and\noverwhelmed, yet he fought well. Say! was he hurt, Holly? It comes upon\nme--no, tell me that I see amiss.\"\n\n\"Not much, I think,\" I answered doubtfully, \"a little blood was running\nfrom his mouth, no more. Look, there go the stains of it upon that\nrock.\"\n\n\"For every drop I'll take a hundred lives. By myself I swear it,\" Ayesha\nmuttered with a groan. Then she cried in a ringing voice,\n\n\"Back and to horse, for I have deeds to do this day. Nay, bide thou\nhere, Holly; we go a shorter path while the army skirts the gorge. Oros,\ngive him food and drink and bathe that hurt upon his head. It is but a\nbruise, for his hood and hair are thick.\"\n\nSo while Oros rubbed some stinging lotion on my scalp, I ate and drank\nas best I could till my brain ceased to swim, for the blow, though\nheavy, had not fractured the bone. When I was ready they brought the\nhorses to us, and mounting them, slowly we scrambled up the steep bed of\nthe water-course.\n\n\"See,\" Ayesha said, pointing to tracks and hoof-prints on the plain at\nits head, \"there was a chariot awaiting him, and harnessed to it were\nfour swift horses. Atene's scheme was clever and well laid, and I, grown\noversure and careless, slept through it all!\"\n\nOn this plain the army of the Tribes that had broken camp before the\ndawn was already gathering fast; indeed, the cavalry, if I may call them\nso, were assembled there to the number of about five thousand men, each\nof whom had a led horse. Ayesha summoned the chiefs and captains, and\naddressed them. \"Servants of Hes,\" she said, \"the stranger lord, my\nbetrothed and guest, has been tricked by a false priest and, falling\ninto a cunning snare, captured as a hostage. It is necessary that I\nfollow him fast, before harm comes--to him. We move down to attack the\narmy of the Khania beyond the river. When its passage is forced I pass\non with the horsemen, for I must sleep in the city of Kaloon to-night.\nWhat sayest thou, Oros? That a second and greater army defends its\nwalls? Man, I know it, and if there is need, that army I will destroy.\nNay, stare not at me. Already they are as dead. Horsemen, you accompany\nme.\n\n\"Captains of the Tribes, you follow, and woe be to that man who hangs\nback in the hour of battle, for death and eternal shame shall be his\nportion, but wealth and honour to those who bear them bravely. Yes, I\ntell you, theirs shall be the fair land of Kaloon. You have your orders\nfor the passing of yonder river. I, with the horsemen, take the central\nford. Let the wings advance.\"\n\nThe chiefs answered with a cheer, for they were fierce men whose\nancestors had loved war for generations. Moreover, mad as seemed the\nenterprise, they trusted in their Oracle, the Hesea, and, like all hill\npeoples, were easily fired by the promise of rich plunder.\n\nAn hour's steady march down the slopes brought the army to the edge\nof the marsh lands. These, as it chanced, proved no obstacle to our\nprogress, for in that season of great drought they were quite dry, and\nfor the same reason the shrunken river was not so impassable a defence\nas I feared that it would be. Still, because of its rocky bottom and\nsteep, opposing banks, it looked formidable enough, while on the crests\nof those banks, in squadrons and companies of horse and foot, were\ngathered the regiments of Atene.\n\nWhile the wings of footmen deployed to right and left, the cavalry\nhalted in the marshes and let their horses fill themselves with the long\ngrass, now a little browned by frost, that grew on this boggy soil, and\nafterwards drink some water.\n\nAll this time Ayesha stood silent, for she also had dismounted, that\nthe mare she rode and her two led horses might graze with the others.\nIndeed, she spoke but once, saying--\"Thou thinkest this adventure mad,\nmy Holly? Say, art afraid?\"\n\n\"Not with thee for captain,\" I answered. \"Still, that second army----\"\n\n\"Shall melt before me like mist before the gale,\" she replied in a low\nand thrilling voice. \"Holly, I tell thee thou shalt see things such as\nno man upon the earth has ever seen. Remember my words when I _loose the\nPowers_ and thou followest the rent veil of Ayesha through the smitten\nsquadrons of Kaloon. Only--what if Atene should dare to murder him? Oh,\nif she should dare!\"\n\n\"Be comforted,\" I replied, wondering what she might mean by this loosing\nof the Powers. \"I think that she loves him too well.\"\n\n\"I bless thee for the words, Holly, yet--I know he will refuse her, and\nthen her hate for me and her jealous rage may overcome her love for him.\nShould this be so, what will avail my vengeance? Eat and drink again,\nHolly--nay, I touch no food until I sit in the palace of Kaloon--and\nlook well to girth and bridle, for thou ridest far and on a wild errand.\nMount thee on Leo's horse, which is swift and sure; if it dies the\nguards will bring thee others.\"\n\nI obeyed her as best I could, and once more bathed my head in a pool,\nand with the help of Oros tied a rag soaked in the liniment on the\nbruise, after which I felt sound enough. Indeed, the mad excitement of\nthose minutes of waiting, and some foreshadowing of the terrible wonders\nthat were about to befall, made me forget my hurts.\n\nNow, Ayesha was standing staring upwards, so that although I could not\nsee her veiled face, I guessed that her eyes must be fixed on the sky\nabove the mountain top. I was certain, also, that she was concentrating\nher fearful will upon an unknown object, for her whole frame quivered\nlike a reed shaken in the wind.\n\nIt was a very strange morning--cold and clear, yet curiously still,\nand with a heaviness in the air such as precedes a great fall of snow,\nalthough for much snow the season was yet too early. Once or twice, too,\nin that utter calm, I thought that I felt everything shudder; not the\nordinary trembling of earthquake, however, for the shuddering seemed to\nbe of the atmosphere quite as much as of the land. It was as though all\nNature around us were a living creature which is very much afraid.\n\nFollowing Ayesha's earnest gaze, I perceived that thick, smoky clouds\nwere gathering one by one in the clear sky above the peak, and that they\nwere edged, each of them, with a fiery rim. Watching these fantastic and\nominous clouds, I ventured to say to her that it looked as though the\nweather would change--not a very original remark, but one which the\ncircumstances suggested.\n\n\"Aye,\" she answered, \"ere night the weather will be wilder even than\nmy heart. No longer shall they cry for water in Kaloon! Mount, Holly,\nmount! The advance begins!\" and unaided she sprang to the saddle of the\nmare that Oros brought her.\n\nThen, in the midst of the five thousand horsemen, we moved down upon\nthe ford. As we reached its brink I noted that the two divisions of\ntribesmen were already entering the stream half a mile to the right and\nleft of us. Of what befell them I can tell nothing from observation,\nalthough I learned later that they forced it after great slaughter on\nboth sides.\n\nIn front of us was gathered the main body of the Khania's army, massed\nby regiments upon the further bank, while hundreds of picked men stood\nup to their middles in the water, waiting to spear or hamstring our\nhorses as we advanced.\n\nNow, uttering their wild, whistling cry, our leading companies dashed\ninto the river, leaving us upon the bank, and soon were engaged hotly\nwith the footmen in midstream. While this fray went on, Oros came to\nAyesha, told her a spy had reported that Leo, bound in a two-wheeled\ncarriage and accompanied by Atene, Simbri and a guard, had passed\nthrough the enemy's camp at night, galloping furiously towards Kaloon.\n\n\"Spare thy words, I know it,\" she answered, and he fell back behind her.\n\nOur squadrons gained the bank, having destroyed most of the men in the\nwater, but as they set foot upon it the enemy charged them and drove\nthem back with loss. Thrice they returned to the attack, and thrice were\nrepulsed in this fashion. At length Ayesha grew impatient.\n\n\"They need a leader, and I will give them one,\" she said. \"Come with me,\nmy Holly,\" and, followed by the main body of the horsemen, she rode a\nlittle way into the river, and there waited until the shattered troops\nhad fallen back upon us. Oros whispered to me--\"It is madness, the Hesea\nwill be slain.\"\n\n\"Thinkest thou so?\" I answered. \"More like that we shall be slain,\"\na saying at which he smiled a little more than usual and shrugged his\nshoulders, since for all his soft ways, Oros was a brave man. Also I\nbelieve that he spoke to try me, knowing that his mistress would take no\nharm.\n\nAyesha held up her hand, in which there was no weapon, and waved it\nforwards. A great cheer answered that signal to advance, and in the\nmidst of it this frail, white-robed woman spoke to her horse, so that it\nplunged deep into the water.\n\nTwo minutes later, and spears and arrows were flying about us so thickly\nthat they seemed to darken the sky. I saw men and horses fall to right\nand left, but nothing touched me or the white robes that floated a yard\nor two ahead. Five minutes and we were gaining the further bank, and\nthere the worst fight began.\n\nIt was fierce indeed, yet never an inch did the white robes give back,\nand where they went men would follow them or fall. We were up the bank\nand the enemy was packed about us, but through them we passed slowly,\nlike a boat through an adverse sea that buffets but cannot stay it.\nYes, further and further, till at last the lines ahead grew thin as the\nliving wedge of horsemen forced its path between them--grew thin, broke\nand vanished.\n\nWe had passed through the heart of the host, and leaving the tribesmen\nwho followed to deal with its flying fragments, rode on half a mile or\nso and mustered. Many were dead and more were hurt, but the command was\nissued that all sore-wounded men should fall out and give their horses\nto replace those that had been killed.\n\nThis was done, and presently we moved on, three thousand of us now, not\nmore, heading for Kaloon. The trot grew to a canter, and the canter to a\ngallop, as we rushed forward across that endless plain, till at midday,\nor a little after--for this route was far shorter than that taken by Leo\nand myself in our devious flight from Rassen and his death-hounds--we\ndimly saw the city of Kaloon set upon its hill.\n\nNow a halt was ordered, for here was a reservoir in which was still\nsome water, whereof the horses drank, while the men ate of the food they\ncarried with them; dried meat and barley meal. Here, too, more spies met\nus, who said that the great army of Atene was posted guarding the\ncity bridges, and that to attack it with our little force would mean\ndestruction. But Ayesha took no heed of their words; indeed, she\nscarcely seemed to hear them. Only she ordered that all wearied horses\nshould be abandoned and fresh ones mounted.\n\nForward again for hour after hour, in perfect silence save for the\nthunder of our horses' hoofs. No word spoke Ayesha, nor did her wild\nescort speak, only from time to time they looked over their shoulders\nand pointed with their red spears at the red sky behind.\n\nI looked also, nor shall I forget its aspect. The dreadful, fire-edged\nclouds had grown and gathered so that beneath their shadows the plain\nlay almost black. They marched above us like an army in the heavens,\nwhile from time to time vaporous points shot forward, thin like swords,\nor massed like charging horse.\n\nUnder them a vast stillness reigned. It was as though the earth lay dead\nbeneath their pall.\n\nKaloon, lit in a lurid light, grew nearer. The pickets of the foe flew\nhomeward before us, shaking their javelins, and their mocking laughter\nreached us in hollow echoes. Now we saw the vast array, posted rank\non rank with silken banners drooping in that stirless air, flanked and\nscreened by glittering regiments of horse.\n\nAn embassy approached us, and at the signal of Ayesha's uplifted arm\nwe halted. It was headed by a lord of the court whose face I knew. He\npulled rein and spoke boldly.\n\n\"Listen, Hes, to the words of Atene. Ere now the stranger lord, thy\ndarling, is prisoner in her palace. Advance, and we destroy thee and thy\nlittle band; but if by any miracle thou shouldst conquer, then he dies.\nGet thee gone to thy Mountain fastness and the Khania gives thee peace,\nand thy people their lives. What answer to the words of the Khania?\"\n\nAyesha whispered to Oros, who called aloud--\"There is no answer. Go, if\nye love life, for death draws near to you.\"\n\nSo they went fast as their swift steeds would carry them, but for a\nlittle while Ayesha still sat lost in thought.\n\nPresently she turned and through her thin veil I saw that her face\nwas white and terrible and that the eyes in it glowed like those of\na lioness at night. She said to, me--hissing the words between her\nclenched teeth--\"Holly, prepare thyself to look into the mouth of hell.\nI desired to spare them if I could, I swear it, but my heart bids me be\nbold, to put off human pity, and use all my secret might if I would see\nLeo living. Holly, I tell thee they are about _to murder him!_\"\n\nThen she cried aloud, \"Fear nothing, Captains. Ye are but few, yet with\nyou goes the strength of ten thousand thousand. Now follow the Hesea,\nand whate'er ye meet, be not dismayed. Repeat it to the soldiers, that\nfearing nothing they follow the Hesea through yonder host and across the\nbridge and into the city of Kaloon.\"\n\nSo the chiefs rode hither and thither, crying out her words, and the\nsavage tribesmen answered--\"Aye, we who followed through the water, will\nfollow across the plain. Onward, Hes, for darkness swallows us.\"\n\nNow some orders were given, and the companies fell into a formation that\nresembled a great wedge, Ayesha herself being its very point and apex,\nfor though Oros and I rode on either side of her, spur as we would, our\nhorses' heads never passed her saddle bow. In front of that dark mass\nshe shone a single spot of white--one snowy feather on a black torrent's\nbreast.\n\nA screaming bugle note--and, like giant arms, from the shelter of some\ngroves of poplar trees, curved horns of cavalry shot out to surround\nus, while the broad bosom of the opposing army, shimmering with spears,\nrolled forward as a wave rolls crowned with sunlit foam, and behind it,\nline upon line, uncountable, lay a surging sea of men.\n\nOur end was near. We were lost, or so it seemed.\n\nAyesha tore off her veil and held it on high, flowing from her like\na pennon, and lo! upon her brow blazed that wide and mystic diadem of\nlight which once only I had seen before.\n\nDenser and denser grew the rushing clouds above; brighter and brighter\ngleamed the unearthly star of light beneath. Louder and louder beat the\nsound of the falling hoofs of ten thousand horses. From the Mountain\npeak behind us went up sudden sheets of flame; it spouted fire as a\nwhale spouts foam.\n\nThe scene was dreadful. In front, the towers of Kaloon lurid in a\nmonstrous sunset. Above, a gloom as of an eclipse. Around the darkling,\nsunburnt plain. On it Atene's advancing army, and our rushing wedge of\nhorsemen destined, it would appear, to inevitable doom.\n\nAyesha let fall her rein. She tossed her arms, waving the torn, white\nveil as though it were a signal cast to heaven.\n\nInstantly from the churning jaws of the unholy night above belched a\nblaze of answering flame, that also wavered like a rent and shaken veil\nin the grasp of a black hand of cloud.\n\nThen did Ayesha roll the thunder of her might upon the Children of\nKaloon. Then she called, and the Terror came, such as men had never seen\nand perchance never more will see. Awful bursts of wind tore past us,\nlifting the very stones and soil before them, and with the wind went\nhail and level, hissing rain, made visible by the arrows of perpetual\nlightnings that leapt downwards from the sky and upwards from the earth.\n\nIt was as she had warned me. It was as though hell had broken loose upon\nthe world, yet through that hell we rushed on unharmed. For always these\nfuries passed before us. No arrow flew, no javelin was stained. The\njagged hail was a herald of our coming; the levens that smote and\nstabbed were our sword and spear, while ever the hurricane roared and\nscreamed with a million separate voices which blended to one yell of\nsound, hideous and indescribable.\n\nAs for the hosts about us they melted and were gone.\n\nNow the darkness was dense, like to that of thickest night; yet in the\nfierce flares of the lightnings I saw them run this way and that, and\namidst the volleying, elemental voices I heard their shouts of horror\nand of agony. I saw horses and riders roll confused upon the ground;\nlike storm-drifted leaves I saw their footmen piled in high and whirling\nheaps, while the brands of heaven struck and struck them till they sank\ntogether and grew still.\n\nI saw the groves of trees bend, shrivel up and vanish. I saw the high\nwalls of Kaloon blown in and flee away, while the houses within the\nwalls took fire, to go out beneath the torrents of the driving rain,\nand again take fire. I saw blackness sweep over us with great wings, and\nwhen I looked, lo! those wide wings were flame, floods of pulsing flame\nthat flew upon the tormented air.\n\nBlackness, utter blackness; turmoil, doom, dismay! Beneath me the\nlabouring horse; at my side the steady crest of light which sat on\nAyesha's brow, and through the tumult a clear, exultant voice that\nsang--\"I promised thee wild weather! Now, Holly, dost thou believe that\nI can loose the prisoned Powers of the world?\"\n\nLo! all was past and gone, and above us shone the quiet evening sky,\nand before us lay the empty bridge, and beyond it the flaming city of\nKaloon. But the armies of Atene, where were they? Go, ask of those great\ncairns that hide their bones. Go, ask it of her widowed land.\n\nYet of our wild company of horsemen not one was lost. After us they\ngalloped trembling, white-lipped, like men who face to face had fought\nand conquered Death, but triumphant--ah, triumphant!\n\nOn the high head of the bridge Ayesha wheeled her horse, and so for\none proud moment stood to welcome them. At the sight of her glorious,\nstar-crowned countenance, which now her Tribes beheld for the first time\nand the last, there went up such a shout as men have seldom heard.\n\n\"_The Goddess!_\" that shout thundered. \"Worship the Goddess!\"\n\nThen she turned her horse's head again, and they followed on through the\nlong straight street of the burning city, up to the palace on its crest.\n\nAs the sun set we sped beneath its gateway. Silence in the courtyard,\nsilence everywhere, save for the distant roar of fire and the scared\nhowlings of the death-hounds in their kennel.\n\nAyesha sprang from her horse, and waving back all save Oros and myself,\nswept through the open doors into the halls beyond.\n\nThey were empty, every one--all were fled or dead. Yet she never paused\nor doubted, but so swiftly that we scarce could follow her, flitted up\nthe wide stone stair that led to the topmost tower. Up, still up, until\nwe reached the chamber where had dwelt Simbri the Shaman, that same\nchamber whence he was wont to watch his stars, in which Atene had\nthreatened us with death.\n\nIts door was shut and barred; still, at Ayesha's coming, yes, before\nthe mere breath of her presence, the iron bolts snapped like twigs, the\nlocks flew back, and inward burst that massive portal.\n\nNow we were within the lamp-lit chamber, and this is what we saw. Seated\nin a chair, pale-faced, bound, yet proud and defiant-looking, was Leo.\nOver him, a dagger in his withered hand--yes, about to strike, in the\nvery act--stood the old Shaman, and on the floor hard by, gazing upward\nwith wide-set eyes, dead and still majestic in her death, lay Atene,\nKhania of Kaloon.\n\nAyesha waved her arm and the knife fell from Simbri's hand, clattering\non the marble, while in an instant he who had held it was smitten to\nstillness and became like a man turned to stone.\n\nShe stooped, lifted the dagger, and with a swift stroke severed Leo's\nbonds; then, as though overcome at last, sank on to a bench in silence.\nLeo rose, looking about him bewildered, and said in the strained voice\nof one who is weak with much suffering--\"But just in time, Ayesha.\nAnother second, and that murderous dog\"--and he pointed to the\nShaman--\"well, it was in time. But how went the battle, and how earnest\nthou here through that awful hurricane? And, oh, Horace, thank heaven\nthey did not kill you after all!\"\n\n\"The battle went ill for some,\" Ayesha answered, \"and I came not through\nthe hurricane, but on its wings. Tell me now, what has befallen thee\nsince we parted?\"\n\n\"Trapped, overpowered, bound, brought here, told that I must write to\nthee and stop thy advance, or die--refused, of course, and then----\" and\nhe glanced at the dead body on the floor.\n\n\"And then?\" repeated Ayesha.\n\n\"Then that fearful tempest, which seemed to drive me mad. Oh! if thou\ncouldst have heard the wind howling round these battlements, tearing\noff their stones as though they were dry leaves; if thou hadst seen the\nlightnings falling thick and fast as rain----\"\n\n\"They were my messengers. I sent them to save thee,\" said Ayesha simply.\n\nLeo stared at her, making no comment, but after a pause, as though he\nwere thinking the matter over, he went on--\"Atene said as much, but I\ndid not believe her. I thought the end of the world had come, that was\nall. Well, she returned just now more mad even than I was, and told me\nthat her people were destroyed and that she could not fight against the\nstrength of hell, but that she could send me thither, and took a knife\nto kill me.\n\n\"I said, 'Kill on,' for I knew that wherever I went thou wouldst follow,\nand I was sick with the loss of blood from some hurt I had in that\nstruggle, and weary of it all. So I shut my eyes waiting for the stroke,\nbut instead I felt her lips pressed upon my forehead, and heard her\nsay--\"'Nay, I will not do it. Fare thee well; fulfil thou thine own\ndestiny, as I fulfil mine. For this cast the dice have fallen against\nme; elsewhere it may be otherwise. I go to load them if I may.'\n\n\"I opened my eyes and looked. There Atene stood, a glass in her\nhand--see, it lies beside her.\n\n\"'Defeated, yet I win,' she cried, 'for I do but pass before thee to\nprepare the path that thou shalt tread, and to make ready thy place in\nthe Under-world. Till we meet again I pledge thee, for I am destroyed.\nAyesha's horsemen are in my streets, and, clothed in lightnings at their\nhead, rides Ayesha's avenging self.'\n\n\"So she drank, and fell dead--but now. Look, her breast still quivers.\nAfterwards, that old man would have murdered me, for, being roped, I\ncould not resist him, but the door burst in and thou camest. Spare him,\nhe is of her blood, and he loved her.\"\n\nThen Leo sank back into the chair where we had discovered him bound, and\nseemed to fall into a kind of torpor, for of a sudden he grew to look\nlike an old man.\n\n\"Thou art sick,\" said Ayesha anxiously. \"Oros, thy medicine, the draught\nI bade thee bring! Be swift, I say.\"\n\nThe priest bowed, and from some pocket in his ample robe produced a\nphial which he opened and gave to Leo, saying--\"Drink, my lord; this\nstuff will give thee back thy health, for it is strong.\"\n\n\"The stronger the better,\" answered Leo, rousing himself, and with\nsomething like his old, cheerful laugh. \"I am thirsty who have touched\nnothing since last night, and have fought hard and been carried far,\nyes--and lived through that hellish storm.\"\n\nThen he took the draught and emptied it. There must have been virtue\nin that potion; at least, the change which it produced in him was\nwonderful. Within a minute his eyes grew bright again, and the colour\nreturned into his cheeks.\n\n\"Thy medicines are very good, as I have learned of old,\" he said to\nAyesha; \"but the best of all of them is to see thee safe and victorious\nbefore me, and to know that I, who looked for death, yet live to greet\nthee, my beloved. There is food,\" and he pointed to a board upon which\nwere meats, \"say, may I eat of them, for I starve?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" she answered softly, \"eat, and, my Holly, eat thou also.\"\n\nSo we fell to, yes, we fell to and ate even in the presence of that dead\nwoman who looked so royal in her death; of the old magician who stood\nthere powerless, like a man petrified, and of Ayesha, the wondrous being\nthat could destroy an army with the fearful weapons which were servant\nto her will.\n\nOnly Oros ate nothing, but remained where he was, smiling at us\nbenignantly, nor did Ayesha touch any food.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nTHE YIELDING OF AYESHA\n\nWhen I had satisfied myself, Leo was still at his meal, for loss of\nblood or the effects of the tremendous nerve tonic which Ayesha ordered\nto be administered to him, had made him ravenous.\n\nI watched his face and became aware of a curious change in it, no\nimmediate change indeed, but one, I think, that had come upon him\ngradually, although I only fully appreciated it now, after our short\nseparation. In addition to the thinness of which I have spoken, his\nhandsome countenance had grown more ethereal; his eyes were full of the\nshadows of things that were to come.\n\nHis aspect pained me, I knew not why. It was no longer that of the\nLeo with whom I was familiar, the deep-chested, mighty-limbed, jovial,\nupright traveller, hunter and fighting-man who had chanced to love and\nbe loved of a spiritual power incarnated in a mould of perfect womanhood\nand armed with all the might of Nature's self. These things were still\npresent indeed, but the man was changed, and I felt sure that this\nchange came from Ayesha, since the look upon his face had become\nexceeding like to that which often hovered upon hers at rest.\n\nShe also was watching him, with speculative, dreamy eyes, till\npresently, as some thought swept through her, I saw those eyes blaze up,\nand the red blood pour to cheek and brow. Yes, the mighty Ayesha whose\ndead, slain for him, lay strewn by the thousand on yonder plain, blushed\nand trembled like a maiden at her first lover's kiss.\n\nLeo rose from the table. \"I would that I had been with thee in the\nfray,\" he said.\n\n\"At the drift there was fighting,\" she answered, \"afterwards none. My\nministers of Fire, Earth and Air smote, no more; I waked them from their\nsleep and at my command they smote for thee and saved thee.\"\n\n\"Many lives to take for one man's safety,\" Leo said solemnly, as though\nthe thought pained him.\n\n\"Had they been millions and not thousands, I would have spent them every\none. On my head be their deaths, not on thine. Or rather on hers,\" and\nshe pointed to the dead Atene. \"Yes, on hers who made this war. At least\nshe should thank me who have sent so royal a host to guard her through\nthe darkness.\"\n\n\"Yet it is terrible,\" said Leo, \"to think of thee, beloved, red to the\nhair with slaughter.\"\n\n\"What reck I?\" she answered with a splendid pride. \"Let their blood\nsuffice to wash the stain of thy blood from off these cruel hands that\nonce did murder thee.\"\n\n\"Who am I that I should blame thee?\" Leo went on as though arguing\nwith himself, \"I who but yesterday killed two men--to save myself from\ntreachery.\"\n\n\"Speak not of it,\" she exclaimed in cold rage. \"I saw the place and,\nHolly, thou knowest how I swore that a hundred lives should pay for\nevery drop of that dear blood of thine, and I, who lie not, have kept\nthe oath. Look now on that man who stands yonder struck by my will to\nstone, dead yet living, and say again what was he about to do to thee\nwhen I entered here?\"\n\n\"To take vengeance on me for the doom of his queen and of her armies,\"\nanswered Leo, \"and Ayesha, how knowest thou that a Power higher than\nthine own will not demand it yet?\"\n\nAs he spoke a pale shadow flickered on Leo's face, such a shadow as\nmight fall from Death's advancing wing, and in the fixed eyes of the\nShaman there shone a stony smile.\n\nFor a moment terror seemed to take Ayesha, then it was gone as quickly\nas it came.\n\n\"Nay,\" she said. \"I ordain that it shall not be, and save One who\nlisteth not, what power reigns in this wide earth that dare defy my\nwill?\"\n\nSo she spoke, and as her words of awful pride--for they were very\nawful--rang round that stone-built chamber, a vision came to me--Holly.\n\nI saw illimitable space peopled with shining suns, and sunk in the\ninfinite void above them one vast Countenance clad in a calm so terrific\nthat at its aspect my spirit sank to nothingness. Yes, and I knew that\nthis was Destiny enthroned above the spheres. Those lips moved and\nobedient worlds rushed upon their course. They moved again and these\nrolling chariots of the heavens were turned or stayed, appeared or\ndisappeared. I knew also that against this calm Majesty the being, woman\nor spirit, at my side had dared to hurl her passion and her strength. My\nsoul reeled. I was afraid.\n\nThe dread phantasm passed, and when my mind cleared again Ayesha was\nspeaking in new, triumphant tones.\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" she cried. \"Past is the night of dread; dawns the day of\nvictory! Look!\" and she pointed through the window-places shattered by\nthe hurricane, to the flaming town beneath, whence rose one continual\nwail of misery, the wail of women mourning their countless slain while\nthe fire roared through their homes like some unchained and rejoicing\ndemon. \"Look Leo on the smoke of the first sacrifice that I offer to thy\nroyal state and listen to its music. Perchance thou deemst it naught.\nWhy then I'll give thee others. Thou lovest war. Good! we will go down\nto war and the rebellious cities of the earth shall be the torches of\nour march.\"\n\nShe paused a moment, her delicate nostrils quivering, and her face\nalight with the prescience of ungarnered splendours; then like a\nswooping swallow flitted to where, by dead Atene, the gold circlet\nfallen from the Khania's hair lay upon the floor.\n\nShe stooped, lifted it, and coming to Leo held it high above his head.\nSlowly she let her hand fall until the glittering coronet rested for an\ninstant on his brow. Then she spoke, in her glorious voice that rolled\nout rich and low, a very paean of triumph and of power.\n\n\"By this poor, earthly symbol I create thee King of Earth; yea in its\nround for thee is gathered all her rule. Be thou its king, and mine!\"\n\nAgain the coronet was held aloft, again it sank, and again she said or\nrather chanted--\"With this unbroken ring, token of eternity, I swear to\nthee the boon of endless days. Endure thou while the world endures, and\nbe its lord, and mine.\"\n\nA third time the coronet touched his brow.\n\n\"By this golden round I do endow thee with Wisdom's perfect gold\nuncountable, that is the talisman whereat all nature's secret paths\nshall open to thy feet. Victorious, victorious, tread thou her wondrous\nways with me, till from her topmost peak at last she wafts us to our\nimmortal throne whereof the columns twain are Life and Death.\"\n\nThen Ayesha cast away the crown and lo! it fell upon the breast of the\nlost Atene and rested there.\n\n\"Art content with these gifts of mine, my lord?\" she cried.\n\nLeo looked at her sadly and shook his head.\n\n\"What more wilt thou then? Ask and I swear it shall be thine.\"\n\n\"Thou swearest; but wilt thou keep the oath?\"\n\n\"Aye, by myself I swear; by myself and by the Strength that bred me.\nIf it be ought that I can grant--then if I refuse it to thee, may such\ndestruction fall upon me as will satisfy even Atene's watching soul.\"\n\nI heard and I think that another heard also, at least once more the\nstony smile shone in the eyes of the Shaman.\n\n\"I ask of thee nothing that thou canst not give. Ayesha, I ask of\nthee thyself--not at some distant time when I have been bathed in a\nmysterious fire, but now, now this night.\"\n\nShe shrank back from him a little, as though dismayed.\n\n\"Surely,\" she said slowly, \"I am like that foolish philosopher who,\nwalking abroad to read the destinies of nations in the stars, fell down\na pitfall dug by idle children and broke his bones and perished there.\nNever did I guess that with all these glories stretched before thee\nlike mountain top on glittering mountain top, making a stairway for thy\nmortal feet to the very dome of heaven, thou wouldst still clutch at thy\nnative earth and seek of it--but the common boon of woman's love.\n\n\"Oh! Leo, I thought that thy soul was set upon nobler aims, that thou\nwouldst pray me for wider powers, for a more vast dominion; that as\nthough they were but yonder fallen door of wood and iron, I should break\nfor thee the bars of Hades, and like the Eurydice of old fable draw thee\nliving down the steeps of Death, or throne thee midst the fires of the\nfurthest sun to watch its subject worlds at play.\n\n\"Or I thought that thou wouldst bid me reveal what no woman ever told,\nthe bitter, naked truth--all my sins and sorrows, all the wandering\nfancies of my fickle thought; even what thou knowest not and perchance\nne'er shalt know, _who I am and whence I came_, and how to thy charmed\neyes I seemed to change from foul to fair, and what is the purpose of\nmy love for thee, and what the meaning of that tale of an angry\ngoddess--who never was except in dreams.\n\n\"I thought--nay, no matter what I thought, save that thou wert far other\nthan thou art, my Leo, and in so high a moment that thou wouldst seek to\npass the mystic gates my glory can throw wide and with me tread an air\nsupernal to the hidden heart of things. Yet thy prayer is but the same\nthat the whole world whispers beneath the silent moon, in the palace and\nthe cottage, among the snows and on the burning desert's waste. 'Oh! my\nlove, thy lips, thy lips. Oh! my love, be mine, now, now, beneath the\nmoon, beneath the moon!'\n\n\"Leo, I thought better, higher, of thee.\"\n\n\"Mayhap, Ayesha, thou wouldest have thought worse of me had I been\ncontent with thy suns and constellations and spiritual gifts and\ndominations that I neither desire nor understand.\n\n\"If I had said to thee: Be thou my angel, not my wife; divide the ocean\nthat I may walk its bed; pierce the firmament and show me how grow the\nstars; tell me the origins of being and of death and instruct me in\ntheir issues; give up the races of mankind to my sword, and the wealth\nof all the earth to fill my treasuries. Teach me also how to drive\nthe hurricane as thou canst do, and to bend the laws of nature to my\npurpose: on earth make me half a god--as thou art.\n\n\"But Ayesha, I am no god; I am a man, and as a man I seek the woman whom\nI love. Oh! divest thyself of all these wrappings of thy power--that\npower which strews thy path with dead and keeps me apart from thee. If\nonly for one short night forget the ambition that gnaws unceasingly at\nthy soul; I say forget thy greatness and be a woman and--my wife.\"\n\nShe made no answer, only looked at him and shook her head, causing her\nglorious hair to ripple like water beneath a gentle breeze.\n\n\"Thou deniest me,\" he went on with gathering strength, \"and that thou\ncanst not do, that thou mayest not do, for Ayesha, thou hast sworn, and\nI demand the fulfilment of thine oath.\n\n\"Hark thou. I refuse thy gifts; I will have none of thy rule who ask no\nPharaoh's throne and wish to do good to men and not to kill them--that\nthe world may profit. I will not go with thee to Kor, nor be bathed in\nthe breath of Life. I will leave thee and cross the mountains, or perish\non them, nor with all thy strength canst thou hold me to thy side, who\nindeed needest me not. No longer will I endure this daily torment,\nthe torment of thy presence and thy sweet words; thy loving looks, thy\npromises for next year, next year--next year. So keep thine oath or let\nme begone.\"\n\nStill Ayesha stood silent, only now her head drooped and her breast\nbegan to heave. Then Leo stepped forward; he seized her in his arms and\nkissed her. She broke from his embrace, I know not how, for though she\nreturned it was close enough, and again stood before him but at a little\ndistance.\n\n\"Did I not warn Holly,\" she whispered with a sigh, \"to bid thee beware\nlest I should catch thy human fire? Man, I say to thee, it begins to\nsmoulder in my heart, and should it grow to flame----\"\n\n\"Why then,\" he answered laughing, \"we will be happy for a little while.\"\n\n\"Aye, Leo, but how long? Why wert thou sole lord of this loveliness of\nmine and not set above their harming, night and day a hundred jealous\ndaggers would seek thy heart and--find it.\"\n\n\"How long, Ayesha? A lifetime, a year, a month, a minute--I neither know\nnor care, and while thou art true to me I fear no stabs of envy.\"\n\n\"Is it so? Wilt take the risk? I can promise thee nothing. Thou\nmightest--yes, in this way or in that, thou mightest--die.\"\n\n\"And if I die, what then? Shall we be separated?\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, Leo, that is not possible. We never can be severed, of this\nI am sure; it is sworn to me. But then through other lives and other\nspheres, higher lives and higher spheres mayhap, our fates must force a\npainful path to their last goal of union.\"\n\n\"Why then I take the hazard, Ayesha. Shall the life that I can risk to\nslay a leopard or a lion in the sport of an idle hour, be too great a\nprice to offer for the splendours of thy breast? Thine oath! Ayesha, I\nclaim thine oath.\"\n\nThen it was that in Ayesha there began the most mysterious and thrilling\nof her many changes. Yet how to describe it I know not unless it be by\nsimile.\n\nOnce in Thibet we were imprisoned for months by snows that stretched\ndown from the mountain slopes into the valleys and oh! how weary did we\ngrow of those arid, aching fields of purest white. At length rain set\nin, and blinding mists in which it was not safe to wander, that made the\ndark nights darker yet.\n\nSo it was, until there came a morning when seeing the sun shine, we went\nto our door and looked out. Behold a miracle! Gone were the snows that\nchoked the valley and in the place of them appeared vivid springing\ngrass, starred everywhere with flowers, and murmuring brooks and birds\nthat sang and nested in the willows. Gone was the frowning sky and all\nthe blue firmament seemed one tender smile. Gone were the austerities of\nwinter with his harsh winds, and in their place spring, companioned by\nher zephyrs, glided down the vale singing her song of love and life.\n\nThere in this high chamber, in the presence of the living and the dead,\nwhile the last act of the great tragedy unrolled itself before me,\nlooking on Ayesha that forgotten scene sprang into my mind. For on her\nface just such a change had come. Hitherto, with all her loveliness,\nthe heart of Ayesha had seemed like that winter mountain wrapped in\nits unapproachable snow and before her pure brow and icy self-command,\naspirations sank abashed and desires died.\n\nShe swore she loved and her love fulfilled itself in death and many a\nmysterious way. Yet it was hard to believe that this passion of hers was\nmore than a spoken part, for how can the star seek the moth although the\nmoth may seek the star? Though the man may worship the goddess, for all\nher smiles divine, how can the goddess love the man?\n\nBut now everything was altered! Look! Ayesha grew human; I could see\nher heart beat beneath her robes and hear her breath come in soft, sweet\nsobs, while o'er her upturned face and in her alluring eyes there spread\nitself that look which is born of love alone. Radiant and more radiant\ndid she seem to grow, sweeter and more sweet, no longer the veiled\nHermit of the Caves, no longer the Oracle of the Sanctuary, no longer\nthe Valkyrie of the battle-plain, but only the loveliest and most happy\nbride that ever gladdened a husband's eyes.\n\nShe spoke, and it was of little things, for thus Ayesha proclaimed the\nconquest of herself.\n\n\"Fie!\" she said, showing her white robes torn with spears and stained by\nthe dust and dew of war; \"Fie, my lord, what marriage garments are these\nin which at last I come to thee, who would have been adorned in regal\ngems and raiment befitting to my state and thine?\"\n\n\"I seek the woman not her garment,\" said Leo, his burning eyes fixed\nupon her face.\n\n\"Thou seekest the woman. Ah! there it lies. Tell me, Leo, am I woman\nor spirit? Say that I am woman, for now the prophecy of this dead Atene\nlies heavy on my soul, Atene who said that mortal and immortal may not\nmate.\"\n\n\"Thou must be woman, or thou wouldst not have tormented me as thou hast\ndone these many weeks.\"\n\n\"I thank thee for the comfort of thy words. Yet, was it _woman_ whose\nbreath wrought destruction upon yonder plain? Was it to a _woman_ that\nBlast and Lightning bowed and said, 'We are here: Command us, we obey'?\nDid that dead thing (and she pointed to the shattered door) break inward\nat a _woman's_ will? Or could a _woman_ charm this man to stone?\n\n\"Oh! Leo, would that I were woman! I tell thee that I'd lay all my\ngrandeur down, a wedding offering at thy feet, could I be sure that for\none short year I should be naught but _woman_ and--thy happy wife.\n\n\"Thou sayest that I did torment thee, but it is I who have known\ntorment, I who desired to yield and dared not. Aye, I tell thee, Leo,\nwere I not sure that thy little stream of life is draining dry into the\ngreat ocean of my life, drawn thither as the sea draws its rivers, or\nas the sun draws mists, e'en now I would not yield. But I know, for my\nwisdom tells it me, ere ever we could reach the shores of Libya, the ill\nwork would be done, and thou dead of thine own longing, thou dead and I\nwidowed who never was a wife.\n\n\"Therefore see! like lost Atene I take the dice and cast them, not\nknowing how they shall fall. Not knowing how they shall fall, for good\nor ill I cast,\" and she made a wild motion as of some desperate gamester\nthrowing his last throw.\n\n\"So,\" Ayesha went on, \"the thing is done and the number summed for aye,\nthough it be hidden from my sight. I have made an end of doubts and\nfears, and come death, come life, I'll meet it bravely.\n\n\"Say, how shall we be wed? I have it. Holly here must join our hands;\nwho else? He that ever was our guide shall give me unto thee, and thee\nto me. This burning city is our altar, the dead and living are our\nwitnesses on earth and heaven. In place of rites and ceremonials for\nthis first time I lay my lips on thine, and when 'tis done, for music\nI'll sing thee a nuptial chant of love such as mortal poet has not\nwritten nor have mortal lovers heard.\n\n\"Come, Holly, do now thy part and give this maiden to this man.\"\n\nLike one in a dream I obeyed her and took Ayesha's outstretched hand\nand Leo's. As I held them thus, I tell the truth:--it was as though some\nfire rushed through my veins from her to him, shaking and shattering me\nwith swift waves of burning and unearthly Bliss. With the fire too came\nglorious visions and sounds of mighty music, and a sense as though my\nbrain, filled with over-flowing life, must burst asunder beneath its\nweight.\n\nI joined their hands; I know not how; I blessed them, I know not in what\nwords. Then I reeled back against the wall and watched.\n\nThis is what I saw.\n\nWith an abandonment and a passion so splendid and intense that it seemed\nmore than human, with a murmured cry of \"Husband!\" Ayesha cast her arms\nabout her lover's neck and drawing down his head to hers so that the\ngold hair was mingled with her raven locks, she kissed him on the lips.\n\nThus they clung a little while, and as they clung the gentle diadem\nof light from her brow spread to his brow also, and through the white\nwrappings of her robe became visible her perfect shape shining with\nfaint fire. With a little happy laugh she left him, saying,\n\n\"Thus, Leo Vincey, oh! thus for the second time do I give myself to\nthee, and with this flesh and spirit all I swore to thee, there in the\ndim Caves of Kor and here in the palace of Kaloon. Know thou this, come\nwhat may, never, never more shall we be separate who are ordained one.\nWhilst thou livest I live at thy side, and when thou diest, if die thy\nmust, I'll follow thee through worlds and firmaments, nor shall all the\ndoors of heaven or hell avail against my love. Where thou goest, thither\nI will go. When thou sleepest, with thee will I sleep and it is my voice\nthat thou shalt hear murmuring through the dreams of life and death; my\nvoice that shall summon thee to awaken in the last hour of everlasting\ndawn, when all this night of misery hath furled her wings for aye.\n\n\"Listen now while I sing to thee and hear that song aright, for in its\nmelody at length thou shalt learn the truth, which unwed I might not\ntell to thee. Thou shalt learn who and what _I_ am, and who and what\n_thou_ art, and of the high purposes of our love, and this dead woman's\nhate, and of all that I have hid from thee in veiled, bewildering words\nand visions.\n\n\"Listen then, my love and lord, to the burden of the Song of Fate.\"\n\nShe ceased speaking and gazed heavenwards with a rapt look as though she\nwaited for some inspiration to fall upon her, and never, never--not even\nin the fires of Kor had Ayesha seemed so divine as she did now in this\nmoment of the ripe harvest of her love.\n\nMy eyes wandered from her to Leo, who stood before her pale and still,\nstill as the death-like figure of the Shaman, still as the Khania's\nicy shape which stared upwards from the ground. What was passing in his\nmind, I wondered, that he could remain thus insensible while in all her\nmight and awful beauty this proud being worshipped him.\n\nHark! she began to sing in a voice so rich and perfect that its honied\nnotes seemed to cloy my blood and stop my breath.\n\n     \"The world was not, was not, and in the womb of Silence\n     Slept the souls of men. Yet I was and thou----\"\n\nSuddenly Ayesha stopped, and I felt rather than saw the horror on her\nface.\n\nLook! Leo swayed to and fro as though the stones beneath him were but\na rocking boat. To and fro he swayed, stretched out his blind arms to\nclasp her--then suddenly fell backwards, and lay still.\n\nOh! what a shriek was that she gave! Surely it must have wakened the\nvery corpses upon the plain. Surely it must have echoed in the stars.\nOne shriek only--then throbbing silence.\n\nI sprang to him, and there, withered in Ayesha's kiss, slain by the fire\nof her love, Leo lay dead--lay dead upon the breast of dead Atene!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nTHE PASSING OF AYESHA\n\nI heard Ayesha say presently, and the words struck me as dreadful\nin their hopeless acceptance of a doom against which even she had no\nstrength to struggle.\n\n\"It seems that my lord has left me for awhile; I must hasten to my lord\nafar.\"\n\nAfter that I do not quite know what happened. I had lost the man who was\nall in all to me, friend and child in one, and I was crushed as I had\nnever been before. It seemed so sad that I, old and outworn, should\nstill live on whilst he in the flower of his age, snatched from joy and\ngreatness such as no man hath known, lay thus asleep.\n\nI think that by an afterthought, Ayesha and Oros tried to restore him,\ntried without result, for here her powers were of no avail. Indeed my\nconviction is that although some lingering life still kept him on his\nfeet, Leo had really died at the moment of her embrace, since when I\nlooked at him before he fell, his face was that of a dead man.\n\nYes, I believe that last speech of hers, although she knew it not, was\naddressed to his spirit, for in her burning kiss his flesh had perished.\n\nWhen at length I recovered myself a little, it was to hear Ayesha in\na cold, calm voice--her face I could not see for she had veiled\nherself--commanding certain priests who had been summoned to \"bear away\nthe body of that accursed woman and bury her as befits her rank.\" Even\nthen I bethought me, I remember, of the tale of Jehu and Jezebel.\n\nLeo, looking strangely calm and happy, lay now upon a couch, the arms\nfolded on his breast. When the priests had tramped away carrying their\nroyal burden, Ayesha, who sat by his body brooding, seemed to awake, for\nshe rose and said--\"I need a messenger, and for no common journey,\nsince he must search out the habitations of the Shades,\" and she turned\nherself towards Oros and appeared to look at him.\n\nNow for the first time I saw that priest change countenance a little,\nfor the eternal smile, of which even this scene had not quite rid it,\nleft his face and he grew pale and trembled.\n\n\"Thou art afraid,\" she said contemptuously. \"Be at rest, Oros, I will\nnot send one who is afraid. Holly, wilt thou go for me--and him?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" I answered. \"I am weary of life and desire no other end. Only let\nit be swift and painless.\"\n\nShe mused a while, then said--\"Nay, thy time is not yet, thou still hast\nwork to do. Endure, my Holly, 'tis only for a breath.\"\n\nThen she looked at the Shaman, the man turned to stone who all this\nwhile had stood there as a statue stands, and cried--\"Awake!\"\n\nInstantly he seemed to thaw into life, his limbs relaxed, his breast\nheaved, he was as he had always been: ancient, gnarled, malevolent.\n\n\"I hear thee, mistress,\" he said, bowing as a man bows to the power that\nhe hates.\n\n\"Thou seest, Simbri,\" and she waved her hand.\n\n\"I see. Things have befallen as Atene and I foretold, have they not?\n'Ere long the corpse of a new-crowned Khan of Kaloon,'\" and he pointed\nto the gold circlet that Ayesha had set on Leo's brow, \"'will lie upon\nthe brink of the Pit of Flame'--as I foretold.\" An evil smile crept into\nhis eyes and he went on--\"Hadst thou not smote me dumb, I who watched\ncould have warned thee that they would so befall; but, great mistress,\nit pleased thee to smite me dumb. And so it seems, O Hes, that thou hast\novershot thyself and liest broken at the foot of that pinnacle which\nstep by step thou hast climbed for more than two thousand weary years.\nSee what thou hast bought at the price of countless lives that now\nbefore the throne of Judgment bring accusations against thy powers\nmisused, and cry out for justice on thy head,\" and he looked at the dead\nform of Leo.\n\n\"I sorrow for them, yet, Simbri, they were well spent,\" Ayesha answered\nreflectively, \"who by their forewritten doom, as it was decreed,\nheld thy knife from falling and thus won me my husband. Aye and I am\nhappy--happier than such blind bats as thou can see or guess. For know\nthat now with him I have re-wed my wandering soul divorced by sin from\nme, and that of our marriage kiss which burned his life away there shall\nstill be born to us children of Forgiveness and eternal Grace and all\nthings that are pure and fair.\n\n\"Look thou, Simbri, I will honour thee. Thou shalt be my messenger, and\nbeware! beware I say how thou dost fulfil thine office, since of every\nsyllable thou must render an account.\n\n\"Go thou down the dark paths of Death, and, since even my thought may\nnot reach to where he sleeps tonight, search out my lord and say to him\nthat the feet of his spouse Ayesha are following fast. Bid him have no\nfear for me who by this last sorrow have atoned my crimes and am in his\nembrace regenerate. Tell him that thus it was appointed, and thus is\nbest, since now he is dipped indeed in the eternal Flame of Life; now\nfor him the mortal night is done and the everlasting day arises. Command\nhim that he await me in the Gate of Death where it is granted that I\ngreet him presently. Thou hearest?\"\n\n\"I hear, O Queen, Mighty-from-of-Old.\"\n\n\"One message more. Say to Atene that I forgive her. Her heart was high\nand greatly did she play her part. There in the Gates we will balance\nour account. Thou hearest?\"\n\n\"I hear, O Eternal Star that hath conquered Night.\"\n\n\"Then, man, _begone!_\"\n\nAs the word left Ayesha's lips Simbri leapt from the floor, grasping at\nthe air as though he would clutch his own departing soul, staggered back\nagainst the board where Leo and I had eaten, overthrowing it, and amid a\nruin of gold and silver vessels, fell down and died.\n\nShe looked at him, then said to me--\"See, though he ever hated me, this\nmagician who has known Ayesha from the first, did homage to my ancient\nmajesty at last, when lies and defiance would serve his end no more.\nNo longer now do I hear the name that his dead mistress gave to me.\nThe 'Star-that-hath-fallen' in his lips and in very truth is become the\n'Star-which-hath-burst-the-bonds-of-Night,' and, re-arisen, shines for\never--shines with its twin immortal to set no more--my Holly. Well,\nhe is gone, and ere now, those that serve me in the Under-world--dost\nremember?--thou sawest their captains in the Sanctuary--bend the head at\ngreat Ayesha's word and make her place ready near her spouse.\n\n\"But oh, what folly has been mine. When even here my wrath can show such\npower, how could I hope that my lord would outlive the fires of my love?\nStill it was better so, for he sought not the pomp I would have given\nhim, nor desired the death of men. Yet such pomp must have been his\nportion in this poor shadow of a world, and the steps that encircle an\nusurper's throne are ever slippery with blood.\n\n\"Thou art weary, my Holly, go rest thee. To-morrow night we journey to\nthe Mountain, there to celebrate these obsequies.\"\n\nI crept into the room adjoining--it had been Simbri's--and laid me down\nupon his bed, but to sleep I was not able. Its door was open, and in the\nlight of the burning city that shone through the casements I could\nsee Ayesha watching by her dead. Hour after hour she watched, her head\nresting on her hand, silent, stirless. She wept not, no sigh escaped\nher; only watched as a tender woman watches a slumbering babe that she\nknows will awake at dawn.\n\nHer face was unveiled and I perceived that it had greatly changed. All\npride and anger were departed from it; it was grown soft, wistful, yet\nfull of confidence and quietness. For a while I could not think of what\nit reminded me, till suddenly I remembered. Now it was like, indeed the\ncounterpart almost, of the holy and majestic semblance of the statue\nof the Mother in the Sanctuary. Yes, with just such a look of love and\npower as that mother cast upon her frightened child new-risen from its\ndream of death, did Ayesha gaze upon her dead, while her parted lips\nalso seemed to whisper \"some tale of hope, sure and immortal.\"\n\nAt length she rose and came into my chamber.\n\n\"Thou thinkest me fallen and dost grieve for me, my Holly,\" she said in\na gentle voice, \"knowing my fears lest some such fate should overtake my\nlord.\"\n\n\"Ay, Ayesha, I grieve for thee as for myself.\"\n\n\"Spare then thy pity, Holly, since although the human part of me would\nhave kept him on the earth, now my spirit doth rejoice that for a while\nhe has burst his mortal bonds. For many an age, although I knew it not,\nin my proud defiance of the Universal Law, I have fought against his\ntrue weal and mine. Thrice have I and the angel wrestled, matching\nstrength with strength, and thrice has he conquered me. Yet as he bore\naway his prize this night he whispered wisdom in my ear. This was his\nmessage: That in death is love's home, in death its strength; that from\nthe charnel-house of life this love springs again glorified and pure, to\nreign a conqueror forever. Therefore I wipe away my tears and, crowned\nonce more a queen of peace, I go to join him whom we have lost, there\nwhere he awaits us, as it is granted to me that I shall do.\n\n\"But I am selfish, and forgot. Thou needest rest. Sleep, friend, I bid\nthee sleep.\"\n\nAnd I slept wondering as my eyes closed whence Ayesha drew this strange\nconfidence and comfort. I know not but it was there, real and not\nassumed. I can only suppose therefore that some illumination had fallen\non her soul, and that, as she stated, the love and end of Leo in a way\nunknown, did suffice to satisfy her court of sins.\n\nAt the least those sins and all the load of death that lay at her door\nnever seemed to trouble her at all. She appeared to look upon them\nmerely as events which were destined to occur, as inevitable fruits of\na seed sowed long ago by the hand of Fate for whose workings she was not\nresponsible. The fears and considerations which weigh with mortals did\nnot affect or oppress her. In this as in other matters, Ayesha was a law\nunto herself.\n\nWhen I awoke it was day, and through the window-place I saw the rain\nthat the people of Kaloon had so long desired falling in one straight\nsheet. I saw also that Ayesha, seated by the shrouded form of Leo, was\ngiving orders to her priests and captains and to some nobles, who had\nsurvived the slaughter of Kaloon, as to the new government of the land.\nThen I slept again.\n\nIt was evening, and Ayesha stood at my bedside.\n\n\"All is prepared,\" she said. \"Awake and ride with me.\"\n\nSo we went, escorted by a thousand cavalry, for the rest stayed to\noccupy, or perchance to plunder, the land of Kaloon. In front the body\nof Leo was borne by relays of priests, and behind it rode the veiled\nAyesha, I at her side.\n\nStrange was the contrast between this departure, and our arrival.\n\nThen the rushing squadrons, the elements that raved, the perpetual sheen\nof lightnings seen through the swinging curtains of the hail; the voices\nof despair from an army rolled in blood beneath the chariot wheels of\nthunder.\n\nNow the white-draped corpse, the slow-pacing horses, the riders with\ntheir spears reversed, and on either side, seen in that melancholy\nmoonlight, the women of Kaloon burying their innumerable dead.\n\nAnd Ayesha herself, yesterday a Valkyrie crested with the star of flame,\nto-day but a bereaved woman humbly following her husband to the tomb.\n\nYet how they feared her! Some widow standing on the grave mould she\nhad dug, pointed as we passed to the body of Leo, uttering bitter words\nwhich I could not catch. Thereon her companions flung themselves upon\nher and felling her with fist and spade, prostrated themselves upon the\nground, throwing dust on their hair in token of their submission to the\npriestess of Death.\n\nAyesha saw them, and said to me with something of her ancient fire and\npride--\"I tread the plain of Kaloon no more, yet as a parting gift have\nI read this high-stomached people a lesson that they needed long. Not\nfor many a generation, O Holly, will they dare to lift spear against the\nCollege of Hes and its subject Tribes.\"\n\nAgain it was night, and where once lay that of the Khan, the man whom he\nhad killed, flanked by the burning pillars, the bier of Leo stood in\nthe inmost Sanctuary before the statue of the Mother whose gentle,\nunchanging eyes seemed to search his quiet face.\n\nOn her throne sat the veiled Hesea, giving commands to her priests and\npriestesses.\n\n\"I am weary,\" she said, \"and it may be that I leave you for a while to\nrest--beyond the mountains. A year, or a thousand years--I cannot say.\nIf so, let Papave, with Oros as her counsellor and husband and their\nseed, hold my place till I return again.\n\n\"Priests and priestesses of the College of Hes, over new territories\nhave I held my hand; take them as an heritage from me, and rule them\nwell and gently. Henceforth let the Hesea of the Mountain be also the\nKhania of Kaloon.\n\n\"Priests and priestesses of our ancient faith, learn to look through its\nrites and tokens, outward and visible, to the in-forming Spirit. If Hes\nthe goddess never ruled on earth, still pitying Nature rules. If the\nname of Isis never rang through the courts of heaven, still in heaven,\nwith all love fulfilled, nursing her human children on her breast,\ndwells the mighty Motherhood where of this statue is the symbol, that\nMotherhood which bore us, and, unforgetting, faithful, will receive us\nat the end.\n\n\"For of the bread of bitterness we shall not always eat, of the water\nof tears we shall not always drink. Beyond the night the royal suns ride\non; ever the rainbow shines around the rain. Though they slip from our\nclutching hands like melted snow, the lives we lose shall yet be found\nimmortal, and from the burnt-out fires of our human hopes will spring a\nheavenly star.\"\n\nShe paused and waved her hand as though to dismiss them, then added by\nan after-thought, pointing to myself--\"This man is my beloved friend and\nguest. Let him be yours also. It is my will that you tend and guard him\nhere, and when the snows have melted and summer is at hand, that\nyou fashion a way for him through the gulf and bring him across the\nmountains by which he came, till you leave him in safety. Hear and\nforget not, for be sure that to me you shall give account of him.\"\n\nThe night drew towards the dawn, and we stood upon the peak above the\ngulf of fire, four of us only--Ayesha and I, and Oros and Papave. For\nthe bearers had laid down the body of Leo upon its edge and gone their\nway. The curtain of flame flared in front of us, its crest bent over\nlike a billow in the gale, and to leeward, one by one, floated the\ntorn-off clouds and pinnacles of fire. By the dead Leo knelt Ayesha,\ngazing at that icy, smiling face, but speaking no single word. At length\nshe rose, and said,--\"Darkness draws near, my Holly, that deep darkness\nwhich foreruns the glory of the dawn. Now fare thee well for one little\nhour. When thou art about to die, but not before, call me, and I will\ncome to thee. Stir not and speak not till all be done, lest when I am no\nlonger here to be thy guard some Presence should pass on and slay thee.\n\n\"Think not that I am conquered, for now my name is Victory! Think not\nthat Ayesha's strength is spent or her tale is done, for of it thou\nreadest but a single page. Think not even that I am today that thing of\nsin and pride, the Ayesha thou didst adore and fear, I who in my lord's\nlove and sacrifice have again conceived my soul. For know that now once\nmore as at the beginning, his soul and mine are _one_.\"\n\nShe thought awhile and added,\n\n\"Friend take this sceptre in memory of me, but beware how thou usest it\nsave at the last to summon me, for it has virtues,\" and she gave me the\njewelled Sistrum that she bore--then said,\n\n\"So kiss his brow, stand back, and be still.\"\n\nNow as once before the darkness gathered on the pit, and presently,\nalthough I heard no prayer, though now no mighty music broke upon the\nsilence, through that darkness, beating up the gale, came the two-winged\nflame and hovered where Ayesha stood.\n\nIt appeared, it vanished, and one by one the long minutes crept away\nuntil the first spear of dawn lit upon the point of rock.\n\nLo! it was empty, utterly empty and lonesome. Gone was the corpse of\nLeo, and gone too was Ayesha the imperial, the divine.\n\nWhither had she gone? I know not. But this I know, that as the light\nreturned and the broad sheet of flame flared out to meet it, I seemed to\nsee two glorious shapes sweeping upward on its bosom, and the faces that\nthey wore were those of Leo and of Ayesha.\n\nOften and often during the weary months that followed, whilst I wandered\nthrough the temple or amid the winter snows upon the Mountain side, did\nI seek to solve this question--Whither had She gone? I asked it of my\nheart; I asked it of the skies; I asked it of the spirit of Leo which\noften was so near to me.\n\nBut no sure answer ever came, nor will I hazard one. As mystery wrapped\nAyesha's origin and lives--for the truth of these things I never\nlearned--so did mystery wrap her deaths, or rather her departings, for\nI cannot think her dead. Surely she still is, if not on earth, then in\nsome other sphere?\n\nSo I believe; and when my own hour comes, and it draws near swiftly, I\nshall know whether I believe in vain, or whether she will appear to be\nmy guide as, with her last words, she swore that she would do. Then,\ntoo, I shall learn what she was about to reveal to Leo when he died, the\npurposes of their being and of their love.\n\nSo I can wait in patience who must not wait for long, though my heart is\nbroken and I am desolate.\n\nOros and all the priests were very good to me. Indeed, even had it been\ntheir wish, they would have feared to be otherwise, who remembered and\nwere sure that in some time to come they must render an account of this\nmatter to their dread queen. By way of return, I helped them as I\nwas best able to draw up a scheme for the government of the conquered\ncountry of Kaloon, and with my advice upon many other questions.\n\nAnd so at length the long months wore away, till at the approach of\nsummer the snows melted. Then I said that I must be gone. They gave me\nof their treasures in precious stones, lest I should need money for my\nfaring, since the gold of which I had such plenty was too heavy to be\ncarried by one man alone. They led me across the plains of Kaloon, where\nnow the husbandmen, those that were left of them, ploughed the land and\nscattered seed, and so on to its city. But amidst those blackened ruins\nover which Atene's palace still frowned unharmed, I would not enter,\nfor to me it was, and always must remain, a home of death. So I camped\noutside the walls by the river just where Leo and I had landed after\nthat poor mad Khan set us free, or rather loosed us to be hunted by his\ndeath-hounds.\n\nNext day we took boat and rowed up the river, past the place where we\nhad seen Atene's cousin murdered, till we came to the Gate-house. Here\nonce again I slept, or rather did not sleep.\n\nOn the following morning I went down into the ravine and found to my\nsurprise that the rapid torrent--shallow enough now--had been roughly\nbridged, and that in preparation for my coming rude but sufficient\nladders were built on the face of the opposing precipice. At the foot of\nthese I bade farewell to Oros, who at our parting smiled benignantly as\non the day we met.\n\n\"We have seen strange things together,\" I said to him, not knowing what\nelse to say.\n\n\"Very strange,\" he answered.\n\n\"At least, friend Oros,\" I went on awkwardly enough, \"events have shaped\nthemselves to your advantage, for you inherit a royal mantle.\"\n\n\"I wrap myself in a mantle of borrowed royalty,\" he answered with\nprecision, \"of which doubtless one day I shall be stripped.\"\n\n\"You mean that the great Ayesha is not dead?\"\n\n\"I mean that She never dies. She changes, that is all. As the wind blows\nnow hence, now hither, so she comes and goes, and who can tell at what\nspot upon the earth, or beyond it, for a while that wind lies sleeping?\nBut at sunset or at dawn, at noon or at midnight, it will begin to blow\nagain, and then woe to those who stand across its path.\n\n\"Remember the dead heaped upon the plains of Kaloon. Remember the\ndeparting of the Shaman Simbri with his message and the words that she\nspoke then. Remember the passing of the Hesea from the Mountain point.\nStranger from the West, surely as to-morrow's sun must rise, as she\nwent, so she will return again, and in my borrowed garment I await her\nadvent.\"\n\n\"I also await her advent,\" I answered, and thus we parted.\n\nAccompanied by twenty picked men bearing provisions and arms, I climbed\nthe ladders easily enough, and now that I had food and shelter, crossed\nthe mountains without mishap. They even escorted me through the desert\nbeyond, till one night we camped within sight of the gigantic Buddha\nthat sits before the monastery, gazing eternally across the sands and\nsnows.\n\nWhen I awoke next morning the priests were gone. So I took up my pack\nand pursued my journey alone, and walking slowly came at sunset to the\ndistant lamasery. At its door an ancient figure, wrapped in a tattered\ncloak, was sitting, engaged apparently in contemplation of the skies. It\nwas our old friend Kou-en. Adjusting his horn spectacles on his nose he\nlooked at me.\n\n\"I was awaiting you, brother of the Monastery called 'the World,'\" he\nsaid in a voice, measured, very ineffectually, to conceal his evident\ndelight. \"Have you grown hungry there that you return to this poor\nplace?\"\n\n\"Aye, most excellent Kou-en,\" I answered, \"hungry for rest.\"\n\n\"It shall be yours for all the days of this incarnation. But say, where\nis the other brother?\"\n\n\"Dead,\" I answered.\n\n\"And therefore re-born elsewhere or perhaps, dreaming in Devachan for\na while. Well, doubtless we shall meet him later on. Come, eat, and\nafterwards tell me your story.\"\n\nSo I ate, and that night I told him all. Kou-en listened with respectful\nattention, but the tale, strange as it might seem to most people,\nexcited no particular wonder in his mind. Indeed, he explained it to me\nat such length by aid of some marvellous theory of re-incarnations, that\nat last I began to doze.\n\n\"At least,\" I said sleepily, \"it would seem that we are all winning\nmerit on the Everlasting Plane,\" for I thought that favourite catchword\nwould please him.\n\n\"Yes, brother of the Monastery called the World,\" Kou-en answered in\na severe voice, \"doubtless you are all winning merit, but, if I may\nventure to say so, you are winning it very slowly, especially the\nwoman--or the sorceress--or the mighty evil spirit--whose names I\nunderstand you to tell me are She, Hes, and Ayesha upon earth and in\n_Avitchi_, Star-that-hath-Fallen----\"\n\n_(Here Mr. Holly's manuscript ends, its outer sheets having been burnt\nwhen he threw it on to the fire at his house in Cumberland.)_\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Ayesha, by H.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
