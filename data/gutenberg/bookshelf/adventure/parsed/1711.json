RIDER HAGGARD\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\nWhere italics are used to indicate non-English words, I have silently\nomitted them or replaced them with quotation marks.\n\nHaggard's spelling, especially of Zulu terms, is wildly inconsistent;\nlikewise his capitalization, especially of Zulu terms. For example,\nMasapo is the chief of the Amansomi until chapter IX; thereafter his\ntribe is consistently referred to as the \"Amasomi\". In general, I have\nretained Haggard's spellings.\n\n\n\n\nDEDICATION\n\n\nDear Mr. Stuart,\n\nFor twenty years, I believe I am right in saying, you, as Assistant\nSecretary for Native Affairs in Natal, and in other offices, have been\nintimately acquainted with the Zulu people. Moreover, you are one of\nthe few living men who have made a deep and scientific study of their\nlanguage, their customs and their history. So I confess that I was the\nmore pleased after you were so good as to read this tale--the\nsecond book of the epic of the vengeance of Zikali, \"the\nThing-that-should-never-have-been-born,\" and of the fall of the House of\nSenzangakona[*]--when you wrote to me that it was animated by the true\nZulu spirit.\n\n     [*--\"Marie\" was the first.  The third and final act in the\n     drama is yet to come.].\n\nI must admit that my acquaintance with this people dates from a period\nwhich closed almost before your day. What I know of them I gathered\nat the time when Cetewayo, of whom my volume tells, was in his glory,\nprevious to the evil hour in which he found himself driven by the\nclamour of his regiments, cut off, as they were, through the annexation\nof the Transvaal, from their hereditary trade of war, to match himself\nagainst the British strength. I learned it all by personal observation\nin the 'seventies, or from the lips of the great Shepstone, my chief and\nfriend, and from my colleagues Osborn, Fynney, Clarke and others, every\none of them long since \"gone down.\"\n\nPerhaps it may be as well that this is so, at any rate in the case of\none who desires to write of the Zulus as a reigning nation, which now\nthey have ceased to be, and to try to show them as they were, in all\ntheir superstitious madness and bloodstained grandeur.\n\nYet then they had virtues as well as vices. To serve their Country in\narms, to die for it and for the King; such was their primitive ideal. If\nthey were fierce they were loyal, and feared neither wounds nor doom; if\nthey listened to the dark redes of the witch-doctor, the trumpet-call\nof duty sounded still louder in their ears; if, chanting their terrible\n\"Ingoma,\" at the King's bidding they went forth to slay unsparingly, at\nleast they were not mean or vulgar. From those who continually must face\nthe last great issues of life or death meanness and vulgarity are\nfar removed. These qualities belong to the safe and crowded haunts of\ncivilised men, not to the kraals of Bantu savages, where, at any rate of\nold, they might be sought in vain.\n\nNow everything is changed, or so I hear, and doubtless in the balance\nthis is best. Still we may wonder what are the thoughts that pass\nthrough the mind of some ancient warrior of Chaka's or Dingaan's time,\nas he suns himself crouched on the ground, for example, where once stood\nthe royal kraal, Duguza, and watches men and women of the Zulu blood\npassing homeward from the cities or the mines, bemused, some of them,\nwith the white man's smuggled liquor, grotesque with the white man's\ncast-off garments, hiding, perhaps, in their blankets examples of the\nwhite man's doubtful photographs--and then shuts his sunken eyes and\nremembers the plumed and kilted regiments making that same ground shake\nas, with a thunder of salute, line upon line, company upon company, they\nrushed out to battle.\n\nWell, because the latter does not attract me, it is of this former time\nthat I have tried to write--the time of the Impis and the witch-finders\nand the rival princes of the royal House--as I am glad to learn from\nyou, not quite in vain. Therefore, since you, so great an expert,\napprove of my labours in the seldom-travelled field of Zulu story, I ask\nyou to allow me to set your name upon this page and subscribe myself,\n\nGratefully and sincerely yours,\n\n\nH. RIDER HAGGARD.\n\n\nDitchingham, 12th October, 1912.\n\n\nTo James Stuart, Esq., Late Assistant Secretary for Native Affairs,\nNatal.\n\n\n\n\nAUTHOR'S NOTE\n\nMr. Allan Quatermain's story of the wicked and fascinating Mameena,\na kind of Zulu Helen, has, it should be stated, a broad foundation in\nhistorical fact. Leaving Mameena and her wiles on one side, the tale of\nthe struggle between the Princes Cetewayo and Umbelazi for succession to\nthe throne of Zululand is true.\n\nWhen the differences between these sons of his became intolerable,\nbecause of the tumult which they were causing in his country, King\nPanda, their father, the son of Senzangakona, and the brother of the\ngreat Chaka and of Dingaan, who had ruled before him, did say that \"when\ntwo young bulls quarrel they had better fight it out.\" So, at least, I\nwas told by the late Mr. F. B. Fynney, my colleague at the time of the\nannexation of the Transvaal in 1877, who, as Zulu Border Agent, with the\nexceptions of the late Sir Theophilus Shepstone and the late Sir Melmoth\nOsborn, perhaps knew more of that land and people than anyone else of\nhis period.\n\nAs a result of this hint given by a maddened king, the great battle of\nthe Tugela was fought at Endondakusuka in December, 1856, between the\nUsutu party, commanded by Cetewayo, and the adherents of Umbelazi\nthe Handsome, his brother, who was known among the Zulus as\n\"Indhlovu-ene-Sihlonti,\" or the \"Elephant with the tuft of hair,\" from a\nlittle lock of hair which grew low down upon his back.\n\nMy friend, Sir Melmoth Osborn, who died in or about the year 1897, was\npresent at this battle, although not as a combatant. Well do I remember\nhis thrilling story, told to me over thirty years ago, of the events of\nthat awful day.\n\nEarly in the morning, or during the previous night, I forget which, he\nswam his horse across the Tugela and hid with it in a bush-clad kopje,\nblindfolding the animal with his coat lest it should betray him. As it\nchanced, the great fight of the day, that of the regiment of veterans,\nwhich Sir Melmoth informed me Panda had sent down at the last moment to\nthe assistance of Umbelazi, his favourite son, took place almost at\nthe foot of this kopje. Mr. Quatermain, in his narrative, calls this\nregiment the Amawombe, but my recollection is that the name Sir Melmoth\nOsborn gave them was \"The Greys\" or \"Upunga.\"\n\nWhatever their exact title may have been, however, they made a great\nstand. At least, he told me that when Umbelazi's impi, or army, began to\ngive before the Usutu onslaught, these \"Greys\" moved forward above 3,000\nstrong, drawn up in a triple line, and were charged by one of Cetewayo's\nregiments.\n\nThe opposing forces met, and the noise of their clashing shields, said\nSir Melmoth, was like the roll of heavy thunder. Then, while he watched,\nthe veteran \"Greys\" passed over the opposing regiment \"as a wave passes\nover a rock\"--these were his exact words--and, leaving about a third of\ntheir number dead or wounded among the bodies of the annihilated foe,\ncharged on to meet a second regiment sent against them by Cetewayo. With\nthese the struggle was repeated, but again the \"Greys\" conquered. Only\nnow there were not more than five or six hundred of them left upon their\nfeet.\n\nThese survivors ran to a mound, round which they formed a ring, and\nhere for a long while withstood the attack of a third regiment, until\nat length they perished almost to a man, buried beneath heaps of their\nslain assailants, the Usutu.\n\nTruly they made a noble end fighting thus against tremendous odds!\n\nAs for the number who fell at this battle of Endondakusuka, Mr. Fynney,\nin a pamphlet which he wrote, says that six of Umbelazi's brothers died,\n\"whilst it is estimated that upwards of 100,000 of the people--men,\nwomen and children--were slain\"--a high and indeed an impossible\nestimate.\n\nThat curious personage named John Dunn, an Englishman who became a\nZulu chief, and who actually fought in this battle, as narrated by Mr.\nQuatermain, however, puts the number much lower. What the true total was\nwill never be known; but Sir Melmoth Osborn told me that when he swam\nhis horse back across the Tugela that night it was black with bodies;\nand Sir Theophilus Shepstone also told me that when he visited the scene\na day or two later the banks of the river were strewn with multitudes of\nthem, male and female.\n\nIt was from Mr. Fynney that I heard the story of the execution by\nCetewayo of the man who appeared before him with the ornaments of\nUmbelazi, announcing that he had killed the prince with his own hand.\nOf course, this tale, as Mr. Quatermain points out, bears a striking\nresemblance to that recorded in the Old Testament in connection with the\ndeath of King Saul.\n\nIt by no means follows, however, that it is therefore apocryphal;\nindeed, Mr. Fynney assured me that it was quite true, although, if he\ngave me his authorities, I cannot remember them after a lapse of more\nthan thirty years.\n\nThe exact circumstances of Umbelazi's death are unknown, but the general\nreport was that he died, not by the assegais of the Usutu, but of a\nbroken heart. Another story declares that he was drowned. His body was\nnever found, and it is therefore probable that it sank in the Tugela, as\nis suggested in the following pages.\n\nI have only to add that it is quite in accordance with Zulu beliefs\nthat a man should be haunted by the ghost of one whom he has murdered\nor betrayed, or, to be more accurate, that the spirit (\"umoya\") should\nenter into the slayer and drive him mad. Or, in such a case, that spirit\nmight bring misfortune upon him, his family, or his tribe.\n\nH. RIDER HAGGARD.\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n     I.    ALLAN QUATERMAIN HEARS OF MAMEENA\n     II.

ALLAN QUATERMAIN HEARS OF MAMEENA\n\n\nWe white people think that we know everything. For instance, we think\nthat we understand human nature. And so we do, as human nature appears\nto us, with all its trappings and accessories seen dimly through the\nglass of our conventions, leaving out those aspects of it which we have\nforgotten or do not think it polite to mention. But I, Allan Quatermain,\nreflecting upon these matters in my ignorant and uneducated fashion,\nhave always held that no one really understands human nature who has\nnot studied it in the rough. Well, that is the aspect of it with which I\nhave been best acquainted.\n\nFor most of the years of my life I have handled the raw material, the\nvirgin ore, not the finished ornament that is smelted out of it--if,\nindeed, it is finished yet, which I greatly doubt. I dare say that a\ntime may come when the perfected generations--if Civilisation, as we\nunderstand it, really has a future and any such should be allowed\nto enjoy their hour on the World--will look back to us as crude,\nhalf-developed creatures whose only merit was that we handed on the\nflame of life.\n\nMaybe, maybe, for everything goes by comparison; and at one end of the\nladder is the ape-man, and at the other, as we hope, the angel. No, not\nthe angel; he belongs to a different sphere, but that last expression\nof humanity upon which I will not speculate. While man is man--that is,\nbefore he suffers the magical death-change into spirit, if such should\nbe his destiny--well, he will remain man. I mean that the same passions\nwill sway him; he will aim at the same ambitions; he will know the same\njoys and be oppressed by the same fears, whether he lives in a Kafir\nhut or in a golden palace; whether he walks upon his two feet or, as for\naught I know he may do one day, flies through the air. This is certain:\nthat in the flesh he can never escape from our atmosphere, and while\nhe breathes it, in the main with some variations prescribed by climate,\nlocal law and religion, he will do much as his forefathers did for\ncountless ages.\n\nThat is why I have always found the savage so interesting, for in him,\nnakedly and forcibly expressed, we see those eternal principles which\ndirect our human destiny.\n\nTo descend from these generalities, that is why also I, who hate\nwriting, have thought it worth while, at the cost of some labour to\nmyself, to occupy my leisure in what to me is a strange land--for\nalthough I was born in England, it is not my country--in setting down\nvarious experiences of my life that do, in my opinion, interpret this\nour universal nature. I dare say that no one will ever read them; still,\nperhaps they are worthy of record, and who knows? In days to come they\nmay fall into the hands of others and prove of value. At any rate, they\nare true stories of interesting peoples, who, if they should survive in\nthe savage competition of the nations, probably are doomed to undergo\ngreat changes. Therefore I tell of them before they began to change.\n\nNow, although I take it out of its strict chronological order, the first\nof these histories that I wish to preserve is in the main that of an\nextremely beautiful woman--with the exception of a certain Nada, called\n\"the Lily,\" of whom I hope to speak some day, I think the most beautiful\nthat ever lived among the Zulus. Also she was, I think, the most able,\nthe most wicked, and the most ambitious. Her attractive name--for it was\nvery attractive as the Zulus said it, especially those of them who were\nin love with her--was Mameena, daughter of Umbezi. Her other name\nwas Child of Storm (Ingane-ye-Sipepo, or, more freely and shortly,\nO-we-Zulu), but the word \"Ma-mee-na\" had its origin in the sound of the\nwind that wailed about the hut when she was born.[*]\n\n     [*--The Zulu word \"Meena\"--or more correctly \"Mina\"--means\n     \"Come here,\" and would therefore be a name not unsuitable to\n     one of the heroine's proclivities; but Mr. Quatermain does\n     not seem to accept this interpretation.--EDITOR.]\n\nSince I have been settled in England I have read--of course in a\ntranslation--the story of Helen of Troy, as told by the Greek poet,\nHomer. Well, Mameena reminds me very much of Helen, or, rather, Helen\nreminds me of Mameena. At any rate, there was this in common between\nthem, although one of them was black, or, rather, copper-coloured,\nand the other white--they both were lovely; moreover, they both were\nfaithless, and brought men by hundreds to their deaths. There, perhaps,\nthe resemblance ends, since Mameena had much more fire and grit than\nHelen could boast, who, unless Homer misrepresents her, must have been\nbut a poor thing after all. Beauty Itself, which those old rascals of\nGreek gods made use of to bait their snares set for the lives and honour\nof men, such was Helen, no more; that is, as I understand her, who have\nnot had the advantage of a classical education. Now, Mameena, although\nshe was superstitious--a common weakness of great minds--acknowledging\nno gods in particular, as we understand them, set her own snares, with\nvarying success but a very definite object, namely, that of becoming the\nfirst woman in the world as she knew it--the stormy, bloodstained world\nof the Zulus.\n\nBut the reader shall judge for himself, if ever such a person should\nchance to cast his eye upon this history.\n\n\nIt was in the year 1854 that I first met Mameena, and my acquaintance\nwith her continued off and on until 1856, when it came to an end in a\nfashion that shall be told after the fearful battle of the Tugela in\nwhich Umbelazi, Panda's son and Cetewayo's brother--who, to his sorrow,\nhad also met Mameena--lost his life. I was still a youngish man in\nthose days, although I had already buried my second wife, as I have told\nelsewhere, after our brief but happy time of marriage.\n\nLeaving my boy in charge of some kind people in Durban, I started into\n\"the Zulu\"--a land with which I had already become well acquainted as a\nyouth, there to carry on my wild life of trading and hunting.\n\nFor the trading I never cared much, as may be guessed from the little\nthat ever I made out of it, the art of traffic being in truth repugnant\nto me. But hunting was always the breath of my nostrils--not that I am\nfond of killing creatures, for any humane man soon wearies of slaughter.\nNo, it is the excitement of sport, which, before breechloaders came in,\nwas acute enough, I can assure you; the lonely existence in wild places,\noften with only the sun and the stars for companions; the continual\nadventures; the strange tribes with whom I came in contact; in short,\nthe change, the danger, the hope always of finding something great and\nnew, that attracted and still attracts me, even now when I _have_ found\nthe great and the new. There, I must not go on writing like this, or I\nshall throw down my pen and book a passage for Africa, and incidentally\nto the next world, no doubt--that world of the great and new!\n\n\nIt was, I think, in the month of May in the year 1854 that I went\nhunting in rough country between the White and Black Umvolosi Rivers, by\npermission of Panda--whom the Boers had made king of Zululand after the\ndefeat and death of Dingaan his brother. The district was very feverish,\nand for this reason I had entered it in the winter months. There was so\nmuch bush that, in the total absence of roads, I thought it wise not\nto attempt to bring my wagons down, and as no horses would live in\nthat veld I went on foot. My principal companions were a Kafir of mixed\norigin, called Sikauli, commonly abbreviated into Scowl, the Zulu chief\nSaduko, and a headman of the Undwandwe blood named Umbezi, at whose\nkraal on the high land about thirty miles away I left my wagon and\ncertain of my men in charge of the goods and some ivory that I had\ntraded.\n\nThis Umbezi was a stout and genial-mannered man of about sixty years of\nage, and, what is rare among these people, one who loved sport for its\nown sake. Being aware of his tastes, also that he knew the country\nand was skilled in finding game, I had promised him a gun if he would\naccompany me and bring a few hunters. It was a particularly bad gun that\nhad seen much service, and one which had an unpleasing habit of going\noff at half-cock; but even after he had seen it, and I in my honesty had\nexplained its weaknesses, he jumped at the offer.\n\n\"O Macumazana\" (that is my native name, often abbreviated into\nMacumazahn, which means \"One who stands out,\" or as many interpret it, I\ndon't know how, \"Watcher-by-Night\")--\"a gun that goes off sometimes when\nyou do not expect it is much better than no gun at all, and you are a\nchief with a great heart to promise it to me, for when I own the White\nMan's weapon I shall be looked up to and feared by everyone between the\ntwo rivers.\"\n\nNow, while he was speaking he handled the gun, that was loaded,\nobserving which I moved behind him. Off it went in due course, its\nrecoil knocking him backwards--for that gun was a devil to kick--and its\nbullet cutting the top off the ear of one of his wives. The lady fled\nscreaming, leaving a little bit of her ear upon the ground.\n\n\"What does it matter?\" said Umbezi, as he picked himself up, rubbing his\nshoulder with a rueful look. \"Would that the evil spirit in the gun had\ncut off her tongue and not her ear! It is the Worn-out-Old-Cow's own\nfault; she is always peeping into everything like a monkey. Now she will\nhave something to chatter about and leave my things alone for awhile. I\nthank my ancestral Spirit it was not Mameena, for then her looks would\nhave been spoiled.\"\n\n\"Who is Mameena?\" I asked. \"Your last wife?\"\n\n\"No, no, Macumazahn; I wish she were, for then I should have the most\nbeautiful wife in the land. She is my daughter, though not that of the\nWorn-out-Old-Cow; her mother died when she was born, on the night of the\nGreat Storm. You should ask Saduko there who Mameena is,\" he added with\na broad grin, lifting his head from the gun, which he was examining\ngingerly, as though he thought it might go off again while unloaded, and\nnodding towards someone who stood behind him.\n\nI turned, and for the first time saw Saduko, whom I recognised at once\nas a person quite out of the ordinary run of natives.\n\nHe was a tall and magnificently formed young man, who, although his\nbreast was scarred with assegai wounds, showing that he was a warrior,\nhad not yet attained to the honour of the \"ring\" of polished wax laid\nover strips of rush bound round with sinew and sewn to the hair, the\n\"isicoco\" which at a certain age or dignity, determined by the king,\nZulus are allowed to assume. But his face struck me more even than his\ngrace, strength and stature. Undoubtedly it was a very fine face, with\nlittle or nothing of the negroid type about it; indeed, he might have\nbeen a rather dark-coloured Arab, to which stock he probably threw back.\nThe eyes, too, were large and rather melancholy, and in his reserved,\ndignified air there was something that showed him to be no common\nfellow, but one of breeding and intellect.\n\n\"Siyakubona\" (that is, \"we see you,\" anglice \"good morrow\") \"Saduko,\" I\nsaid, eyeing him curiously. \"Tell me, who is Mameena?\"\n\n\"Inkoosi,\" he answered in his deep voice, lifting his delicately shaped\nhand in salutation, a courtesy that pleased me who, after all, was\nnothing but a white hunter, \"Inkoosi, has not her father said that she\nis his daughter?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" answered the jolly old Umbezi, \"but what her father has not said\nis that Saduko is her lover, or, rather, would like to be. Wow! Saduko,\"\nhe went on, shaking his fat finger at him, \"are you mad, man, that you\nthink a girl like that is for you? Give me a hundred cattle, not one\nless, and I will begin to think of it. Why, you have not ten, and\nMameena is my eldest daughter, and must marry a rich man.\"\n\n\"She loves me, O Umbezi,\" answered Saduko, looking down, \"and that is\nmore than cattle.\"\n\n\"For you, perhaps, Saduko, but not for me who am poor and want cows.\nAlso,\" he added, glancing at him shrewdly, \"are you so sure that Mameena\nloves you though you be such a fine man? Now, I should have thought that\nwhatever her eyes may say, her heart loves no one but herself, and\nthat in the end she will follow her heart and not her eyes. Mameena the\nbeautiful does not seek to be a poor man's wife and do all the hoeing.\nBut bring me the hundred cattle and we will see, for, speaking truth\nfrom my heart, if you were a big chief there is no one I should like\nbetter as a son-in-law, unless it were Macumazahn here,\" he said,\ndigging me in the ribs with his elbow, \"who would lift up my House on\nhis white back.\"\n\nNow, at this speech Saduko shifted his feet uneasily; it seemed to me\nas though he felt there was truth in Umbezi's estimate of his daughter's\ncharacter. But he only said:\n\n\"Cattle can be acquired.\"\n\n\"Or stolen,\" suggested Umbezi.\n\n\"Or taken in war,\" corrected Saduko. \"When I have a hundred head I will\nhold you to your word, O father of Mameena.\"\n\n\"And then what would you live on, fool, if you gave all your beasts to\nme? There, there, cease talking wind. Before you have a hundred head of\ncattle Mameena will have six children who will not call _you_ father.\nAh, don't you like that? Are you going away?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am going,\" he answered, with a flash of his quiet eyes; \"only\nthen let the man whom they do call father beware of Saduko.\"\n\n\"Beware of how you talk, young man,\" said Umbezi in a grave voice.\n\"Would you travel your father's road? I hope not, for I like you well;\nbut such words are apt to be remembered.\"\n\nSaduko walked away as though he did not hear.\n\n\"Who is he?\" I asked.\n\n\"One of high blood,\" answered Umbezi shortly. \"He might be a chief\nto-day had not his father been a plotter and a wizard. Dingaan smelt him\nout\"--and he made a sideways motion with his hand that among the Zulus\nmeans much. \"Yes, they were killed, almost every one; the chief, his\nwives, his children and his headmen--every one except Chosa\nhis brother and his son Saduko, whom Zikali the dwarf, the\nSmeller-out-of-evil-doers, the Ancient, who was old before Senzangakona\nbecame a father of kings, hid him. There, that is an evil tale to talk\nof,\" and he shivered. \"Come, White Man, and doctor that old Cow of mine,\nor she will give me no peace for months.\"\n\nSo I went to see the Worn-out-Old-Cow--not because I had any particular\ninterest in her, for, to tell the truth, she was a very disagreeable and\nantique person, the cast-off wife of some chief whom at an unknown date\nin the past the astute Umbezi had married from motives of policy--but\nbecause I hoped to hear more of Miss Mameena, in whom I had become\ninterested.\n\nEntering a large hut, I found the lady so impolitely named \"the Old Cow\"\nin a parlous state. There she lay upon the floor, an unpleasant object\nbecause of the blood that had escaped from her wound, surrounded by a\ncrowd of other women and of children. At regular intervals she announced\nthat she was dying, and emitted a fearful yell, whereupon all the\naudience yelled also; in short, the place was a perfect pandemonium.\n\nTelling Umbezi to get the hut cleared, I said that I would go to fetch\nmy medicines. Meanwhile I ordered my servant, Scowl, a humorous-looking\nfellow, light yellow in hue, for he had a strong dash of Hottentot in\nhis composition, to cleanse the wound. When I returned from the wagon\nten minutes later the screams were more terrible than before, although\nthe chorus now stood without the hut. Nor was this altogether wonderful,\nfor on entering the place I found Scowl trimming up \"the Old Cow's\" ear\nwith a pair of blunt nail-scissors.\n\n\"O Macumazana,\" said Umbezi in a hoarse whisper, \"might it not perhaps\nbe as well to leave her alone? If she bled to death, at any rate she\nwould be quieter.\"\n\n\"Are you a man or a hyena?\" I answered sternly, and set about the job,\nScowl holding the poor woman's head between his knees.\n\nIt was over at length; a simple operation in which I exhibited--I\nbelieve that is the medical term--a strong solution of caustic applied\nwith a feather.\n\n\"There, Mother,\" I said, for now we were alone in the hut, whence Scowl\nhad fled, badly bitten in the calf, \"you won't die now.\"\n\n\"No, you vile White Man,\" she sobbed. \"I shan't die, but how about my\nbeauty?\"\n\n\"It will be greater than ever,\" I answered; \"no one else will have an\near with such a curve in it. But, talking of beauty, where is Mameena?\"\n\n\"I don't know where she is,\" she replied with fury, \"but I very well\nknow where she would be if I had my way. That peeled willow-wand of\na girl\"--here she added certain descriptive epithets I will not\nrepeat--\"has brought this misfortune upon me. We had a slight quarrel\nyesterday, White Man, and, being a witch as she is, she prophesied evil.\nYes, when by accident I scratched her ear, she said that before long\nmine should burn, and surely burn it does.\" (This, no doubt, was true,\nfor the caustic had begun to bite.)\n\n\"O devil of a White Man,\" she went on, \"you have bewitched me; you have\nfilled my head with fire.\"\n\nThen she seized an earthenware pot and hurled it at me, saying, \"Take\nthat for your doctor-fee. Go, crawl after Mameena like the others and\nget her to doctor you.\"\n\nBy this time I was half through the bee-hole of the hut, my movements\nbeing hastened by a vessel of hot water which landed on me behind.\n\n\"What is the matter, Macumazahn?\" asked old Umbezi, who was waiting\noutside.\n\n\"Nothing at all, friend,\" I answered with a sweet smile, \"except that\nyour wife wants to see you at once. She is in pain, and wishes you to\nsoothe her. Go in; do not hesitate.\"\n\nAfter a moment's pause he went in--that is, half of him went in. Then\ncame a fearful crash, and he emerged again with the rim of a pot about\nhis neck and his countenance veiled in a coating of what I took to be\nhoney.\n\n\"Where is Mameena?\" I asked him as he sat up spluttering.\n\n\"Where I wish I was,\" he answered in a thick voice; \"at a kraal five\nhours' journey away.\"\n\nWell, that was the first I heard of Mameena.\n\nThat night as I sat smoking my pipe under the flap lean-to attached\nto the wagon, laughing to myself over the adventure of \"the Old Cow,\"\nfalsely described as \"worn out,\" and wondering whether Umbezi had got\nthe honey out of his hair, the canvas was lifted, and a Kafir wrapped in\na kaross crept in and squatted before me.\n\n\"Who are you?\" I asked, for it was too dark to see the man's face.\n\n\"Inkoosi,\" answered a deep voice, \"I am Saduko.\"\n\n\"You are welcome,\" I answered, handing him a little gourd of snuff in\ntoken of hospitality. Then I waited while he poured some of the snuff\ninto the palm of his hand and took it in the usual fashion.\n\n\"Inkoosi,\" he said, when he had scraped away the tears produced by the\nsnuff, \"I have come to ask you a favour. You heard Umbezi say to-day\nthat he will not give me his daughter, Mameena, unless I give him a\nhundred head of cows. Now, I have not got the cattle, and I cannot earn\nthem by work in many years. Therefore I must take them from a certain\ntribe I know which is at war with the Zulus. But this I cannot do unless\nI have a gun. If I had a good gun, Inkoosi--one that only goes off\nwhen it is asked, and not of its own fancy, I who have some name could\npersuade a number of men whom I know, who once were servants of my\nfather, or their sons, to be my companions in this venture.\"\n\n\"Do I understand that you wish me to give you one of my good guns with\ntwo mouths to it (i.e. double-barrelled), a gun worth at least twelve\noxen, for nothing, O Saduko?\" I asked in a cold and scandalised voice.\n\n\"Not so, O Watcher-by-Night,\" he answered; \"not so, O\nHe-who-sleeps-with-one-eye-open\" (another free and difficult rendering\nof my native name, Macumazahn, or more correctly, Macumazana)--\"I should\nnever dream of offering such an insult to your high-born intelligence.\"\nHe paused and took another pinch of snuff, then went on in a meditative\nvoice: \"Where I propose to get those hundred cattle there are many more;\nI am told not less than a thousand head in all. Now, Inkoosi,\" he added,\nlooking at me sideways, \"suppose you gave me the gun I ask for, and\nsuppose you accompanied me with your own gun and your armed hunters, it\nwould be fair that you should have half the cattle, would it not?\"\n\n\"That's cool,\" I said. \"So, young man, you want to turn me into a\ncow-thief and get my throat cut by Panda for breaking the peace of his\ncountry?\"\n\n\"Neither, Macumazahn, for these are my own cattle. Listen, now, and\nI will tell you a story. You have heard of Matiwane, the chief of the\nAmangwane?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered. \"His tribe lived near the head of the Umzinyati,\ndid they not? Then they were beaten by the Boers or the English, and\nMatiwane came under the Zulus. But afterwards Dingaan wiped him out,\nwith his House, and now his people are killed or scattered.\"\n\n\"Yes, his people are killed and scattered, but his House still lives.\nMacumazahn, I am his House, I, the only son of his chief wife, for\nZikali the Wise Little One, the Ancient, who is of the Amangwane blood,\nand who hated Chaka and Dingaan--yes, and Senzangakona their father\nbefore them, but whom none of them could kill because he is so great and\nhas such mighty spirits for his servants, saved and sheltered me.\"\n\n\"If he is so great, why, then, did he not save your father also,\nSaduko?\" I asked, as though I knew nothing of this Zikali.\n\n\"I cannot say, Macumazahn. Perhaps the spirits plant a tree for\nthemselves, and to do so cut down many other trees. At least, so it\nhappened. It happened thus: Bangu, chief of the Amakoba, whispered into\nDingaan's ear that Matiwane, my father, was a wizard; also that he was\nvery rich. Dingaan listened because he thought a sickness that he had\ncame from Matiwane's witchcraft. He said: 'Go, Bangu, and take a company\nwith you and pay Matiwane a visit of honour, and in the night, O in the\nnight! Afterwards, Bangu, we will divide the cattle, for Matiwane is\nstrong and clever, and you shall not risk your life for nothing.'\"\n\nSaduko paused and looked down at the ground, brooding heavily.\n\n\"Macumazahn, it was done,\" he said presently. \"They ate my father's\nmeat, they drank his beer; they gave him a present from the king, they\npraised him with high names; yes, Bangu took snuff with him and called\nhim brother. Then in the night, O in the night--!\n\n\"My father was in the hut with my mother, and I, so big only\"--and he\nheld his hand at the height of a boy of ten--\"was with them. The cry\narose, the flames began to eat; my father looked out and saw. 'Break\nthrough the fence and away, woman,' he said; 'away with Saduko, that he\nmay live to avenge me. Begone while I hold the gate! Begone to Zikali,\nfor whose witchcrafts I pay with my blood.'\n\n\"Then he kissed me on the brow, saying but one word, 'Remember,' and\nthrust us from the hut.\n\n\"My mother broke a way through the fence; yes, she tore at it with her\nnails and teeth like a hyena. I looked back out of the shadow of the hut\nand saw Matiwane my father fighting like a buffalo. Men went down before\nhim, one, two, three, although he had no shield: only his spear. Then\nBangu crept behind him and stabbed him in the back and he threw up his\narms and fell. I saw no more, for by now we were through the fence. We\nran, but they perceived us. They hunted us as wild dogs hunt a buck.\nThey killed my mother with a throwing assegai; it entered at her back\nand came out at her heart. I went mad, I drew it from her body, I ran at\nthem. I dived beneath the shield of the first, a very tall man, and held\nthe spear, so, in both my little hands. His weight came upon its point\nand it went through him as though he were but a bowl of buttermilk. Yes,\nhe rolled over, quite dead, and the handle of the spear broke upon the\nground. Now the others stopped astonished, for never had they seen such\na thing. That a child should kill a tall warrior, oh! that tale had not\nbeen told. Some of them would have let me go, but just then Bangu came\nup and saw the dead man, who was his brother.\n\n\"'Wow!' he said when he knew how the man had died. 'This lion's cub is\na wizard also, for how else could he have killed a soldier who has known\nwar? Hold out his arms that I may finish him slowly.'\n\n\"So two of them held out my arms, and Bangu came up with his spear.\"\n\nSaduko ceased speaking, not that his tale was done, but because his\nvoice choked in his throat. Indeed, seldom have I seen a man so moved.\nHe breathed in great gasps, the sweat poured from him, and his muscles\nworked convulsively. I gave him a pannikin of water and he drank, then\nhe went on:\n\n\"Already the spear had begun to prick--look, here is the mark of\nit\"--and opening his kaross he pointed to a little white line just\nbelow the breast-bone--\"when a strange shadow thrown by the fire of\nthe burning huts came between Bangu and me, a shadow as that of a toad\nstanding on its hind legs. I looked round and saw that it was the shadow\nof Zikali, whom I had seen once or twice. There he stood, though whence\nhe came I know not, wagging his great white head that sits on the top\nof his body like a pumpkin on an ant-heap, rolling his big eyes and\nlaughing loudly.\n\n\"'A merry sight,' he cried in his deep voice that sounded like water\nin a hollow cave. 'A merry sight, O Bangu, Chief of the Amakoba! Blood,\nblood, plenty of blood! Fire, fire, plenty of fire! Wizards dead here,\nthere, and everywhere! Oh, a merry sight! I have seen many such; one at\nthe kraal of your grandmother, for instance--your grandmother the great\nInkosikazi, when myself I escaped with my life because I was so old; but\nnever do I remember a merrier than that which this moon shines on,' and\nhe pointed to the White Lady who just then broke through the clouds.\n'But, great Chief Bangu, lord loved by the son of Senzangakona, brother\nof the Black One (Chaka) who has ridden hence on the assegai, what\nis the meaning of _this_ play?' and he pointed to me and to the two\nsoldiers who held out my little arms.\n\n\"'I kill the wizard's cub, Zikali, that is all,' answered Bangu.\n\n\"'I see, I see,' laughed Zikali. 'A gallant deed! You have butchered the\nfather and the mother, and now you would butcher the child who has slain\none of your grown warriors in fair fight. A very gallant deed, well\nworthy of the chief of the Amakoba! Well, loose his spirit--only--' He\nstopped and took a pinch of snuff from a box which he drew from a slit\nin the lobe of his great ear.\n\n\"'Only what?' asked Bangu, hesitating.\n\n\"'Only I wonder, Bangu, what you will think of the world in which you\nwill find yourself before to-morrow's moon arises. Come back thence and\ntell me, Bangu, for there are so many worlds beyond the sun, and I would\nlearn for certain which of them such a one as you inhabits: a man who\nfor hatred and for gain murders the father and the mother and then\nbutchers the child--the child that could slay a warrior who has seen\nwar--with the spear hot from his mother's heart.'\n\n\"'Do you mean that I shall die if I kill this lad?' shouted Bangu in a\ngreat voice.\n\n\"'What else?' answered Zikali, taking another pinch of snuff.\n\n\"'This, Wizard; that we will go together.'\n\n\"'Good, good!' laughed the dwarf. 'Let us go together. Long have I\nwished to die, and what better companion could I find than Bangu, Chief\nof the Amakoba, Slayer of Children, to guard me on a dark and terrible\nroad. Come, brave Bangu, come; kill me if you can,' and again he laughed\nat him.\n\n\"Now, Macumazahn, the people of Bangu fell back muttering, for they\nfound this business horrible. Yes, even those who held my arms let go of\nthem.\n\n\"'What will happen to me, Wizard, if I spare the boy?' asked Bangu.\n\n\"Zikali stretched out his hand and touched the scratch that the assegai\nhad made in me here. Then he held up his finger red with my blood,\nand looked at it in the light of the moon; yes, and tasted it with his\ntongue.\n\n\"'I think this will happen to you, Bangu,' he said. 'If you spare this\nboy he will grow into a man who will kill you and many others one day.\nBut if you do not spare him I think that his spirit, working as spirits\ncan do, will kill you to-morrow. Therefore the question is, will\nyou live a while or will you die at once, taking me with you as your\ncompanion? For you must not leave me behind, brother Bangu.'\n\n\"Now Bangu turned and walked away, stepping over the body of my mother,\nand all his people walked away after him, so that presently Zikali the\nWise and Little and I were left alone.\n\n\"'What! have they gone?' said Zikali, lifting up his eyes from the\nground. 'Then we had better be going also, Son of Matiwane, lest he\nshould change his mind and come back. Live on, Son of Matiwane, that you\nmay avenge Matiwane.'\"\n\n\"A nice tale,\" I said. \"But what happened afterwards?\"\n\n\"Zikali took me away and nurtured me at his kraal in the Black Kloof,\nwhere he lived alone save for his servants, for in that kraal he would\nsuffer no woman to set foot, Macumazahn. He taught me much wisdom and\nmany secret things, and would have made a great doctor of me had I so\nwilled. But I willed it not who find spirits ill company, and there are\nmany of them about the Black Kloof, Macumazahn. So in the end he said:\n'Go where your heart calls, and be a warrior, Saduko. But know this:\nYou have opened a door that can never be shut again, and across the\nthreshold of that door spirits will pass in and out for all your life,\nwhether you seek them or seek them not.'\n\n\"'It was you who opened the door, Zikali,' I answered angrily.\n\n\"'Mayhap,' said Zikali, laughing after his fashion, 'for I open when I\nmust and shut when I must. Indeed, in my youth, before the Zulus were a\npeople, they named me Opener of Doors; and now, looking through one of\nthose doors, I see something about you, O Son of Matiwane.'\n\n\"'What do you see, my father?' I asked.\n\n\"'I see two roads, Saduko: the Road of Medicine, that is the spirit\nroad, and the Road of Spears, that is the blood road. I see you\ntravelling on the Road of Medicine, that is my own road, Saduko, and\ngrowing wise and great, till at last, far, far away, you vanish over the\nprecipice to which it leads, full of years and honour and wealth, feared\nyet beloved by all men, white and black. Only that road you must travel\nalone, since such wisdom may have no friends, and, above all, no woman\nto share its secrets. Then I look at the Road of Spears and see you,\nSaduko, travelling on that road, and your feet are red with blood, and\nwomen wind their arms about your neck, and one by one your enemies go\ndown before you. You love much, and sin much for the sake of the love,\nand she for whom you sin comes and goes and comes again. And the road is\nshort, Saduko, and near the end of it are many spirits; and though you\nshut your eyes you see them, and though you fill your ears with clay you\nhear them, for they are the ghosts of your slain. But the end of your\njourneying I see not. Now choose which road you will, Son of Matiwane,\nand choose swiftly, for I speak no more of this matter.'\n\n\"Then, Macumazahn, I thought a while of the safe and lonely path of\nwisdom, also of the blood-red path of spears where I should find love\nand war, and my youth rose up in me and--I chose the path of spears and\nthe love and the sin and the unknown death.\"\n\n\"A foolish choice, Saduko, supposing that there is any truth in this\ntale of roads, which there is not.\"\n\n\"Nay, a wise one, Macumazahn, for since then I have seen Mameena and\nknow why I chose that path.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" I said. \"Mameena--I forgot her. Well, after all, perhaps there is\nsome truth in your tale of roads. When _I_ have seen Mameena I will tell\nyou what I think.\"\n\n\"When you have seen Mameena, Macumazahn, you will say that the choice\nwas very wise. Well, Zikali, Opener of Doors, laughed loudly when he\nheard it. 'The ox seeks the fat pasture, but the young bull the rough\nmountainside where the heifers graze,' he said; 'and after all, a\nbull is better than an ox. Now begin to travel your own road, Son of\nMatiwane, and from time to time return to the Black Kloof and tell me\nhow it fares with you. I will promise you not to die before I know the\nend of it.'\n\n\"Now, Macumazahn, I have told you things that hitherto have lived in my\nown heart only. And, Macumazahn, Bangu is in ill favour with Panda, whom\nhe defies in his mountain, and I have a promise--never mind how--that he\nwho kills him will be called to no account and may keep his cattle. Will\nyou come with me and share those cattle, O Watcher-by-Night?\"\n\n\"Get thee behind me, Satan,\" I said in English, then added in Zulu: \"I\ndon't know. If your story is true I should have no objection to helping\nto kill Bangu; but I must learn lots more about this business first.\nMeanwhile I am going on a shooting trip to-morrow with Umbezi the Fat,\nand I like you, O Chooser of the Road of Spears and Blood. Will you be\nmy companion and earn the gun with two mouths in payment?\"\n\n\"Inkoosi,\" he said, lifting his hand in salute with a flash of his dark\neyes, \"you are generous, you honour me. What is there that I should love\nbetter? Yet,\" he added, and his face fell, \"first I must ask Zikali the\nLittle, Zikali my foster-father.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" I said, \"so you are still tied to the Wizard's girdle, are you?\"\n\n\"Not so, Macumazahn; but I promised him not long ago that I would\nundertake no enterprise, save that you know of, until I had spoken with\nhim.\"\n\n\"How far off does Zikali live?\" I asked Saduko.\n\n\"One day's journeying. Starting at sunrise I can be there by sunset.\"\n\n\"Good! Then I will put off the shooting for three days and come with you\nif you think that this wonderful old dwarf will receive me.\"\n\n\"I believe that he will, Macumazahn, for this reason--he told me that\nI should meet you and love you, and that you would be mixed up in my\nfortunes.\"\n\n\"Then he poured moonshine into your gourd instead of beer,\" I answered.\n\"Would you keep me here till midnight listening to such foolishness when\nwe must start at dawn? Begone now and let me sleep.\"\n\n\"I go,\" he answered with a little smile. \"But if this is so, O\nMacumazana, why do you also wish to drink of the moonshine of Zikali?\"\nand he went.\n\nYet I did not sleep very well that night, for Saduko and his strange and\nterrible story had taken a hold of my imagination. Also, for reasons of\nmy own, I greatly wished to see this Zikali, of whom I had heard a great\ndeal in past years. I wished further to find out if he was a common\nhumbug, like so many witch-doctors, this dwarf who announced that my\nfortunes were mixed up with those of his foster-son, and who at least\ncould tell me something true or false about the history and position\nof Bangu, a person for whom I had conceived a strong dislike, possibly\nquite unjustified by the facts. But more than all did I wish to see\nMameena, whose beauty or talents produced so much impression upon the\nnative mind. Perhaps if I went to see Zikali she would be back at her\nfather's kraal before we started on our shooting trip.\n\nThus it was then that fate wove me and my doings into the web of some\nvery strange events; terrible, tragic and complete indeed as those of a\nGreek play, as it has often done both before and since those days.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. THE MOONSHINE OF ZIKALI\n\n\nOn the following morning I awoke, as a good hunter always should do,\njust at that time when, on looking out of the wagon, nothing can be seen\nbut a little grey glint of light which he knows is reflected from the\nhorns of the cattle tied to the trek-tow. Presently, however, I saw\nanother glint of light which I guessed came from the spear of Saduko,\nwho was seated by the ashes of the cooking fire wrapped in his kaross\nof wildcat skins. Slipping from the voorkisse, or driving-box, I came\nbehind him softly and touched him on the shoulder. He leapt up with a\nstart which revealed his nervous nature, then recognising me through the\nsoft grey gloom, said:\n\n\"You are early, Macumazahn.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" I answered; \"am I not named Watcher-by-Night? Now let us\ngo to Umbezi and tell him that I shall be ready to start on our hunting\ntrip on the third morning from to-day.\"\n\nSo we went, to find that Umbezi was in a hut with his last wife and\nasleep. Fortunately enough, however, as under the circumstances I did\nnot wish to disturb him, outside the hut we found the Old Cow, whose\nsore ear had kept her very wide awake, who, for purposes of her own,\nalthough etiquette did not allow her to enter the hut, was waiting for\nher husband to emerge.\n\nHaving examined her wound and rubbed some ointment on it, with her I\nleft my message. Next I woke up my servant Scowl, and told him that I\nwas going on a short journey, and that he must guard all things until my\nreturn; and while I did so, took a nip of raw rum and made ready a bag\nof biltong, that is sun-dried flesh, and biscuits.\n\nThen, taking with me a single-barrelled gun, that same little Purdey\nrifle with which I shot the vultures on the Hill of Slaughter at\nDingaan's Kraal,[*] we started on foot, for I would not risk my only\nhorse on such a journey.\n\n     [*--For the story of this shooting of the vultures by Allan\n     Quatermain, see the book called \"Marie.\"--EDITOR.]\n\nA rough journey it proved to be indeed, over a series of bush-clad hills\nthat at their crests were covered with rugged stones among which no\nhorse could have travelled. Up and down these hills we went, and across\nthe valleys that divided them, following some path which I could not\nsee, for all that live-long day. I have always been held a good walker,\nbeing by nature very light and active; but I am bound to say that my\ncompanion taxed my powers to the utmost, for on he marched for hour\nafter hour, striding ahead of me at such a rate that at times I was\nforced to break into a run to keep up with him. Although my pride would\nnot suffer me to complain, since as a matter of principle I would never\nadmit to a Kafir that he was my master at anything, glad enough was I\nwhen, towards evening, Saduko sat himself down on a stone at the top of\na hill and said:\n\n\"Behold the Black Kloof, Macumazahn,\" which were almost the first words\nhe had uttered since we started.\n\nTruly the spot was well named, for there, cut out by water from the\nheart of a mountain in some primeval age, lay one of the most gloomy\nplaces that ever I had beheld. It was a vast cleft in which granite\nboulders were piled up fantastically, perched one upon another in great\ncolumns, and upon its sides grew dark trees set sparsely among the\nrocks. It faced towards the west, but the light of the sinking sun that\nflowed up it served only to accentuate its vast loneliness, for it was a\nbig cleft, the best part of a mile wide at its mouth.\n\nUp this dreary gorge we marched, mocked at by chattering baboons and\nfollowing a little path not a foot wide that led us at length to a large\nhut and several smaller ones set within a reed fence and overhung by a\ngigantic mass of rock that looked as though it might fall at any moment.\nAt the gate of the fence two natives of I know not what tribe, men of\nfierce and forbidding appearance, suddenly sprang out and thrust their\nspears towards my breast.\n\n\"Whom bring you here, Saduko?\" asked one of them sternly.\n\n\"A white man that I vouch for,\" he answered. \"Tell Zikali that we wait\non him.\"\n\n\"What need to tell Zikali that which he knows already?\" said the sentry.\n\"Your food and that of your companion is already cooked in yonder hut.\nEnter, Saduko, with him for whom you vouch.\"\n\nSo we went into the hut and ate, also I washed myself, for it was a\nbeautifully clean hut, and the stools, wooden bowls, etc., were finely\ncarved out of red ivory wood, this work, Saduko informed me, being done\nby Zikali's own hand. Just as we were finishing our meal a messenger\ncame to tell us that Zikali waited our presence. We followed him across\nan open space to a kind of door in the tall reed fence, passing which I\nset eyes for the first time upon the famous old witch-doctor of whom so\nmany tales were told.\n\nCertainly he was a curious sight in those strange surroundings, for they\nwere very strange, and I think their complete simplicity added to the\neffect. In front of us was a kind of courtyard with a black floor made\nof polished ant-heap earth and cow-dung, two-thirds of which at least\nwas practically roofed in by the huge over-hanging mass of rock whereof\nI have spoken, its arch bending above at a height of not less than\nsixty or seventy feet from the ground. Into this great, precipice-backed\ncavity poured the fierce light of the setting sun, turning it and all\nwithin it, even the large straw hut in the background, to the deep hue\nof blood. Seeing the wonderful effect of the sunset in that dark and\nforbidding place, it occurred to me at once that the old wizard must\nhave chosen this moment to receive us because of its impressiveness.\n\nThen I forgot these scenic accessories in the sight of the man himself.\nThere he sat on a stool in front of his hut, quite unattended, and\nwearing only a cloak of leopard skins open in front, for he was\nunadorned with the usual hideous trappings of a witch-doctor, such as\nsnake-skins, human bones, bladders full of unholy compounds, and so\nforth.\n\nWhat a man he was, if indeed he could be called quite human. His\nstature, though stout, was only that of a child; his head was enormous,\nand from it plaited white hair fell down on to his shoulders. His eyes\nwere deep and sunken, his face was broad and very stern. Except for this\nsnow-white hair, however, he did not look ancient, for his flesh was\nfirm and plump, and the skin on his cheeks and neck unwrinkled, which\nsuggested to me that the story of his great antiquity was false. A man\nwho was over a hundred years old, for instance, surely could not boast\nsuch a beautiful set of teeth, for even at that distance I could see\nthem gleaming. On the other hand, evidently middle age was far behind\nhim; indeed, from his appearance it was quite impossible to guess even\napproximately the number of his years. There he sat, red in the red\nlight, perfectly still, and staring without a blink of his eyes at the\nfurious ball of the setting sun, as an eagle is said to be able to do.\n\nSaduko advanced, and I walked after him. My stature is not great, and\nI have never considered myself an imposing person, but somehow I do not\nthink that I ever felt more insignificant than on this occasion. The\ntall and splendid native beside, or rather behind whom I walked, the\ngloomy magnificence of the place, the blood-red light in which it was\nbathed, and the solemn, solitary, little figure with wisdom stamped upon\nits face before me, all tended to induce humility in a man not naturally\nvain. I felt myself growing smaller and smaller, both in a moral and a\nphysical sense; I wished that my curiosity had not prompted me to seek\nan interview with yonder uncanny being.\n\nWell, it was too late to retreat; indeed, Saduko was already standing\nbefore the dwarf and lifting his right arm above his head as he gave him\nthe salute of \"Makosi!\"[*] whereon, feeling that something was expected\nof me, I took off my shabby cloth hat and bowed, then, remembering my\nwhite man's pride, replaced it on my head.\n\n     [*--\"Makosi\", the plural of \"Inkoosi\", is the salute given\n     to Zulu wizards, because they are not one but many, since in\n     them (as in the possessed demoniac in the Bible) dwell an\n     unnumbered horde of spirits.--EDITOR.]\n\nThe wizard suddenly seemed to become aware of our presence, for, ceasing\nhis contemplation of the sinking sun, he scanned us both with his slow,\nthoughtful eyes, which somehow reminded me of those of a chameleon,\nalthough they were not prominent, but, as I have said, sunken.\n\n\"Greeting, son Saduko!\" he said in a deep, rumbling voice. \"Why are you\nback here so soon, and why do you bring this flea of a white man with\nyou?\"\n\nNow this was more than I could bear, so without waiting for my\ncompanion's answer I broke in:\n\n\"You give me a poor name, O Zikali. What would you think of me if I\ncalled you a beetle of a wizard?\"\n\n\"I should think you clever,\" he answered after reflection, \"for after\nall I must look something like a beetle with a white head. But why\nshould you mind being compared to a flea? A flea works by night and so\ndo you, Macumazahn; a flea is active and so are you; a flea is very hard\nto catch and kill and so are you; and lastly a flea drinks its fill of\nthat which it desires, the blood of man and beast, and so you have done,\ndo, and will, Macumazahn,\" and he broke into a great laugh that rolled\nand echoed about the rocky roof above.\n\nOnce, long years before, I had heard that laugh, when I was a prisoner\nin Dingaan's kraal, after the massacre of Retief and his company, and I\nrecognised it again.\n\nWhile I was searching for some answer in the same vein, and not finding\nit, though I thought of plenty afterwards, ceasing of a sudden from his\nunseemly mirth, he went on:\n\n\"Do not let us waste time in jests, for it is a precious thing, and\nthere is but little of it left for any one of us. Your business, son\nSaduko?\"\n\n\"Baba!\" (that is the Zulu for father), said Saduko, \"this white Inkoosi,\nfor, as you know well enough, he is a chief by nature, a man of a great\nheart and doubtless of high blood [this, I believe, is true, for I have\nbeen told that my ancestors were more or less distinguished,\nalthough, if this is so, their talents did not lie in the direction of\nmoney-making], has offered to take me upon a shooting expedition and to\ngive me a good gun with two mouths in payment of my services. But I told\nhim I could not engage in any fresh venture without your leave, and--he\nis come to see whether you will grant it, my father.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" answered the dwarf, nodding his great head. \"This clever white\nman has taken the trouble of a long walk in the sun to come here to\nask me whether he may be allowed the privilege of presenting you with a\nweapon of great value in return for a service that any man of your years\nin Zululand would love to give for nothing in such company?\n\n\"Son Saduko, because my eye-holes are hollow, do you think it your part\nto try to fill them up with dust? Nay, the white man has come because\nhe desires to see him who is named Opener-of-Roads, of whom he heard a\ngreat deal when he was but a lad, and to judge whether in truth he has\nwisdom, or is but a common cheat. And you have come to learn whether or\nno your friendship with him will be fortunate; whether or no he will aid\nyou in a certain enterprise that you have in your mind.\"\n\n\"True, O Zikali,\" I said. \"That is so far as I am concerned.\"\n\nBut Saduko answered nothing.\n\n\"Well,\" went on the dwarf, \"since I am in the mood I will try to answer\nboth your questions, for I should be a poor Nyanga\" [that is doctor]\n\"if I did not when you have travelled so far to ask them. Moreover, O\nMacumazana, be happy, for I seek no fee who, having made such fortune\nas I need long ago, before your father was born across the Black Water,\nMacumazahn, no longer work for a reward--unless it be from the hand of\none of the House of Senzangakona--and therefore, as you may guess, work\nbut seldom.\"\n\nThen he clapped his hands, and a servant appeared from somewhere behind\nthe hut, one of those fierce-looking men who had stopped us at the gate.\nHe saluted the dwarf and stood before him in silence and with bowed\nhead.\n\n\"Make two fires,\" said Zikali, \"and give me my medicine.\"\n\nThe man fetched wood, which he built into two little piles in front of\nZikali. These piles he fired with a brand brought from behind the hut.\nThen he handed his master a catskin bag.\n\n\"Withdraw,\" said Zikali, \"and return no more till I summon you, for I am\nabout to prophesy. If, however, I should seem to die, bury me to-morrow\nin the place you know of and give this white man a safe-conduct from my\nkraal.\"\n\nThe man saluted again and went without a word.\n\nWhen he had gone the dwarf drew from the bag a bundle of twisted roots,\nalso some pebbles, from which he selected two, one white and the other\nblack.\n\n\"Into this stone,\" he said, holding up the white pebble so that the\nlight from the fire shone on it--since, save for the lingering red\nglow, it was now growing dark--\"into this stone I am about to draw\nyour spirit, O Macumazana; and into this one\"--and he held up the black\npebble--\"yours, O Son of Matiwane. Why do you look frightened, O brave\nWhite Man, who keep saying in your heart, 'He is nothing but an ugly\nold Kafir cheat'? If I am a cheat, why do you look frightened? Is your\nspirit already in your throat, and does it choke you, as this little\nstone might do if you tried to swallow it?\" and he burst into one of his\ngreat, uncanny laughs.\n\nI tried to protest that I was not in the least frightened, but failed,\nfor, in fact, I suppose my nerves were acted on by his suggestion, and\nI did feel exactly as though that stone were in my throat, only coming\nupwards, not going downwards. \"Hysteria,\" thought I to myself, \"the\nresult of being overtired,\" and as I could not speak, sat still as\nthough I treated his gibes with silent contempt.\n\n\"Now,\" went on the dwarf, \"perhaps I shall seem to die; and if so do not\ntouch me lest you should really die. Wait till I wake up again and tell\nyou what your spirits have told me. Or if I do not wake up--for a time\nmust come when I shall go on sleeping--well--for as long as I have\nlived--after the fires are quite out, not before, lay your hands upon\nmy breast; and if you find me turning cold, get you gone to some other\nNyanga as fast as the spirits of this place will let you, O ye who would\npeep into the future.\"\n\nAs he spoke he threw a big handful of the roots that I have mentioned\non to each of the fires, whereon tall flames leapt up from them, very\nunholy-looking flames which were followed by columns of dense, white\nsmoke that emitted a most powerful and choking odour quite unlike\nanything that I had ever smelt before. It seemed to penetrate all\nthrough me, and that accursed stone in my throat grew as large as an\napple and felt as though someone were poking it upwards with a stick.\n\nNext he threw the white pebble into the right-hand fire, that which was\nopposite to me, saying:\n\n\"Enter, Macumazahn, and look,\" and the black pebble he threw into the\nleft-hand fire saying: \"Enter, Son of Matiwane, and look. Then come back\nboth of you and make report to me, your master.\"\n\nNow it is a fact that as he said these words I experienced a sensation\nas though a stone had come out of my throat; so readily do our nerves\ndeceive us that I even thought it grated against my teeth as I opened my\nmouth to give it passage. At any rate the choking was gone, only now I\nfelt as though I were quite empty and floating on air, as though I were\nnot I, in short, but a mere shell of a thing, all of which doubtless was\ncaused by the stench of those burning roots. Still I could look and take\nnote, for I distinctly saw Zikali thrust his huge head, first into the\nsmoke of what I will call my fire, next into that of Saduko's fire, and\nthen lean back, blowing the stuff in clouds from his mouth and nostrils.\nAfterwards I saw him roll over on to his side and lie quite still with\nhis arms outstretched; indeed, I noticed that one of his fingers seemed\nto be in the left-hand fire and reflected that it would be burnt off. In\nthis, however, I must have been mistaken, since I observed subsequently\nthat it was not even scorched.\n\nThus Zikali lay for a long while till I began to wonder whether he were\nnot really dead. Dead enough he seemed to be, for no corpse could have\nstayed more stirless. But that night I could not keep my thoughts\nfixed on Zikali or anything. I merely noted these circumstances in a\nmechanical way, as might one with whom they had nothing whatsoever to\ndo. They did not interest me at all, for there appeared to be nothing\nin me to be interested, as I gathered according to Zikali, because I was\nnot there, but in a warmer place than I hope ever to occupy, namely, in\nthe stone in that unpleasant-looking, little right-hand fire.\n\nSo matters went as they might in a dream. The sun had sunk completely,\nnot even an after-glow was left. The only light remaining was that\nfrom the smouldering fires, which just sufficed to illumine the bulk of\nZikali, lying on his side, his squat shape looking like that of a dead\nhippopotamus calf. What was left of my consciousness grew heartily sick\nof the whole affair; I was tired of being so empty.\n\nAt length the dwarf stirred. He sat up, yawned, sneezed, shook himself,\nand began to rake among the burning embers of my fire with his naked\nhand. Presently he found the white stone, which was now red-hot--at any\nrate it glowed as though it were--and after examining it for a moment\nfinally popped it into his mouth! Then he hunted in the other fire for\nthe black stone, which he treated in a similar fashion. The next thing I\nremember was that the fires, which had died away almost to nothing, were\nburning very brightly again, I suppose because someone had put fuel on\nthem, and Zikali was speaking.\n\n\"Come here, O Macumazana and O Son of Matiwane,\" he said, \"and I will\nrepeat to you what your spirits have been telling me.\"\n\nWe drew near into the light of the fires, which for some reason or other\nwas extremely vivid. Then he spat the white stone from his mouth into\nhis big hand, and I saw that now it was covered with lines and patches\nlike a bird's egg.\n\n\"You cannot read the signs?\" he said, holding it towards me; and when I\nshook my head went on: \"Well, I can, as you white men read a book. All\nyour history is written here, Macumazahn; but there is no need to tell\nyou that, since you know it, as I do well enough, having learned it in\nother days, the days of Dingaan, Macumazahn. All your future, also, a\nvery strange future,\" and he scanned the stone with interest. \"Yes, yes;\na wonderful life, and a noble death far away. But of these matters you\nhave not asked me, and therefore I may not tell them even if I wished,\nnor would you believe if I did. It is of your hunting trip that you have\nasked me, and my answer is that if you seek your own comfort you will do\nwell not to go. A pool in a dry river-bed; a buffalo bull with the\ntip of one horn shattered. Yourself and the bull in the pool. Saduko,\nyonder, also in the pool, and a little half-bred man with a gun jumping\nabout upon the bank. Then a litter made of boughs and you in it, and the\nfather of Mameena walking lamely at your side. Then a hut and you in it,\nand the maiden called Mameena sitting at your side.\n\n\"Macumazahn, your spirit has written on this stone that you should\nbeware of Mameena, since she is more dangerous than any buffalo. If you\nare wise you will not go out hunting with Umbezi, although it is true\nthat hunt will not cost you your life. There, away, Stone, and take\nyour writings with you!\" and as he spoke he jerked his arm and I heard\nsomething whiz past my face.\n\nNext he spat out the black stone and examined it in similar fashion.\n\n\"Your expedition will be successful, Son of Matiwane,\" he said.\n\"Together with Macumazahn you will win many cattle at the cost of sundry\nlives. But for the rest--well, you did not ask me of it, did you? Also,\nI have told you something of that story before to-day. Away, Stone!\" and\nthe black pebble followed the white out into the surrounding gloom.\n\nWe sat quite still until the dwarf broke the deep silence with one of\nhis great laughs.\n\n\"My witchcraft is done,\" he said. \"A poor tale, was it not? Well, hunt\nfor those stones to-morrow and read the rest of it if you can. Why did\nyou not ask me to tell you everything while I was about it, White Man?\nIt would have interested you more, but now it has all gone from me back\ninto your spirit with the stones. Saduko, get you to sleep. Macumazahn,\nyou who are a Watcher-by-Night, come and sit with me awhile in my hut,\nand we will talk of other things. All this business of the stones is\nnothing more than a Kafir trick, is it, Macumazahn? When you meet the\nbuffalo with the split horn in the pool of a dried river, remember it is\nbut a cheating trick, and now come into my hut and drink a kamba [bowl]\nof beer and let us talk of other things more interesting.\"\n\nSo he took me into the hut, which was a fine one, very well lighted by\na fire in its centre, and gave me Kafir beer to drink, that I swallowed\ngratefully, for my throat was dry and still felt as though it had been\nscraped.\n\n\"Who are you, Father?\" I asked point-blank when I had taken my seat upon\na low stool, with my back resting against the wall of the hut, and lit\nmy pipe.\n\nHe lifted his big head from the pile of karosses on which he was lying\nand peered at me across the fire.\n\n\"My name is Zikali, which means 'Weapons,' White Man. You know as much\nas that, don't you?\" he answered. \"My father 'went down' so long ago\nthat his does not matter. I am a dwarf, very ugly, with some learning,\nas we of the Black House understand it, and very old. Is there anything\nelse you would like to learn?\"\n\n\"Yes, Zikali; how old?\"\n\n\"There, there, Macumazahn, as you know, we poor Kafirs cannot count very\nwell. How old? Well, when I was young I came down towards the coast from\nthe Great River, you call it the Zambesi, I think, with Undwandwe, who\nlived in the north in those days. They have forgotten it now because it\nis some time ago, and if I could write I would set down the history of\nthat march, for we fought some great battles with the people who used to\nlive in this country. Afterwards I was the friend of the Father of the\nZulus, he whom they still call Inkoosi Umkulu--the mighty chief--you may\nhave heard tell of him. I carved that stool on which you sit for him and\nhe left it back to me when he died.\"\n\n\"Inkoosi Umkulu!\" I exclaimed. \"Why, they say he lived hundreds of years\nago.\"\n\n\"Do they, Macumazahn? If so, have I not told you that we black people\ncannot count as well as you do? Really it was only the other day.\nAnyhow, after his death the Zulus began to maltreat us Undwandwe and the\nQuabies and the Tetwas with us--you may remember that they called us\nthe Amatefula, making a mock of us. So I quarrelled with the Zulus and\nespecially with Chaka, he whom they named 'Uhlanya' [the Mad One].\nYou see, Macumazahn, it pleased him to laugh at me because\nI am not as other men are. He gave me a name which means\n'The-thing-which-should-never-have-been-born.' I will not speak that\nname, it is secret to me, it may not pass my lips. Yet at times he\nsought my wisdom, and I paid him back for his names, for I gave him very\nill counsel, and he took it, and I brought him to his death, although\nnone ever saw my finger in that business. But when he was dead at the\nhands of his brothers Dingaan and Umhlangana and of Umbopa, Umbopa who\nalso had a score to settle with him, and his body was cast out of the\nkraal like that of an evil-doer, why I, who because I was a dwarf was\nnot sent with the _men_ against Sotshangana, went and sat on it at\nnight and laughed thus,\" and he broke into one of his hideous peals of\nmerriment.\n\n\"I laughed thrice: once for my wives whom he had taken; once for my\nchildren whom he had slain; and once for the mocking name that he had\ngiven me. Then I became the counsellor of Dingaan, whom I hated worse\nthan I had hated Chaka, for he was Chaka again without his greatness,\nand you know the end of Dingaan, for you had a share in that war, and of\nUmhlangana, his brother and fellow-murderer, whom I counselled Dingaan\nto slay. This I did through the lips of the old Princess Menkabayi,\nJama's daughter, Senzangakona's sister, the Oracle before whom all men\nbowed, causing her to say that 'This land of the Zulus cannot be ruled\nby a crimson assegai.' For, Macumazahn, it was Umhlangana who first\nstruck Chaka with the spear. Now Panda reigns, the last of the sons of\nSenzangakona, my enemy, Panda the Fool, and I hold my hand from Panda\nbecause he tried to save the life of a child of mine whom Chaka slew.\nBut Panda has sons who are as Chaka was, and against them I work as I\nworked against those who went before them.\"\n\n\"Why?\" I asked.\n\n\"Why? Oh! if I were to tell you _all_ my story you would understand why,\nMacumazahn. Well, perhaps I will one day.\" (Here I may state that as a\nmatter of fact he did, and a very wonderful tale it is, but as it has\nnothing to do with this history I will not write it here.)\n\n\"I dare say,\" I answered. \"Chaka and Dingaan and Umhlangana and the\nothers were not nice people. But another question. Why do you tell\nme all this, O Zikali, seeing that were I but to repeat it to a\ntalking-bird you would be smelt out and a single moon would not die\nbefore you do?\"\n\n\"Oh! I should be smelt out and killed before one moon dies, should I?\nThen I wonder that this has not happened during all the moons that are\ngone. Well, I tell the story to you, Macumazahn, who have had so much to\ndo with the tale of the Zulus since the days of Dingaan, because I wish\nthat someone should know it and perhaps write it down when everything\nis finished. Because, too, I have just been reading your spirit and see\nthat it is still a white spirit, and that you will not whisper it to a\n'talking-bird.'\"\n\nNow I leant forward and looked at him.\n\n\"What is the end at which you aim, O Zikali?\" I asked. \"You are not one\nwho beats the air with a stick; on whom do you wish the stick to fall at\nlast?\"\n\n\"On whom?\" he answered in a new voice, a low, hissing voice. \"Why, on\nthese proud Zulus, this little family of men who call themselves the\n'People of Heaven,' and swallow other tribes as the great tree-snake\nswallows kids and small bucks, and when it is fat with them cries to the\nworld, 'See how big I am! Everything is inside of me.' I am a Ndwande,\none of those peoples whom it pleases the Zulus to call 'Amatefula'--poor\nhangers-on who talk with an accent, nothing but bush swine. Therefore I\nwould see the swine tusk the hunter. Or, if that may not be, I would\nsee the black hunter laid low by the rhinoceros, the white rhinoceros\nof your race, Macumazahn, yes, even if it sets its foot upon the Ndwande\nboar as well. There, I have told you, and this is the reason that I live\nso long, for I will not die until these things have come to pass, as\ncome to pass they will. What did Chaka, Senzangakona's son, say when the\nlittle red assegai, the assegai with which he slew his mother, aye and\nothers, some of whom were near to me, was in his liver? What did he say\nto Mbopa and the princes? Did he not say that he heard the feet of a\ngreat white people running, of a people who should stamp the Zulus flat?\nWell, I, 'The-thing-who-should-not-have-been-born,' live on until that\nday comes, and when it comes I think that you and I, Macumazahn, shall\nnot be far apart, and that is why I have opened out my heart to you, I\nwho have knowledge of the future. There, I speak no more of these things\nthat are to be, who perchance have already said too much of them. Yet do\nnot forget my words. Or forget them if you will, for I shall remind\nyou of them, Macumazahn, when the feet of your people have avenged the\nNdwandes and others whom it pleases the Zulus to treat as dirt.\"\n\nNow, this strange man, who had sat up in his excitement, shook his long\nwhite hair which, after the fashion of wizards, he wore plaited into\nthin ropes, till it hung like a veil about him, hiding his broad face\nand deep eyes. Presently he spoke again through this veil of hair,\nsaying:\n\n\"You are wondering, Macumazahn, what Saduko has to do with all these\ngreat events that are to be. I answer that he must play his part in\nthem; not a very great part, but still a part, and it is for this\npurpose that I saved him as a child from Bangu, Dingaan's man, and\nreared him up to be a warrior, although, since I cannot lie, I warned\nhim that he would do well to leave spears alone and follow after wisdom.\nWell, he will slay Bangu, who now has quarrelled with Panda, and a woman\nwill come into the story, one Mameena, and that woman will bring about\nwar between the sons of Panda, and from this war shall spring the ruin\nof the Zulus, for he who wins will be an evil king to them and\nbring down on them the wrath of a mightier race. And so\n'The-thing-that-should-not-have-been-born' and the Ndwandes and the\nQuabies and Twetwas, whom it has pleased the conquering Zulus to name\n'Amatefula,' shall be avenged. Yes, yes, my Spirit tells me all these\nthings, and they are true.\"\n\n\"And what of Saduko, my friend and your fosterling?\"\n\n\"Saduko, your friend and my fosterling, will take his appointed road,\nMacumazahn, as I shall and you will. What more could he desire, seeing\nit is that which he has chosen? He will take his road and he will play\nthe part which the Great-Great has prepared for him. Seek not to know\nmore. Why should you, since Time will tell you the story? And now go to\nrest, Macumazahn, as I must who am old and feeble. And when it pleases\nyou to visit me again, we will talk further. Meanwhile, remember always\nthat I am nothing but an old Kafir cheat who pretends to a knowledge\nthat belongs to no man. Remember it especially, Macumazahn, when you\nmeet a buffalo with a split horn in the pool of a dried-up river, and\nafterwards, when a woman named Mameena makes a certain offer to you,\nwhich you may be tempted to accept. Good night to you, Watcher-by-Night\nwith the white heart and the strange destiny, good night to you, and try\nnot to think too hardly of the old Kafir cheat who just now is called\n'Opener-of-Roads.' My servant waits without to lead you to your hut,\nand if you wish to be back at Umbezi's kraal by nightfall to-morrow,\nyou will do well to start ere sunrise, since, as you found in coming,\nSaduko, although he may be a fool, is a very good walker, and you do not\nlike to be left behind, Macumazahn, do you?\"\n\nSo I rose to go, but as I went some impulse seemed to take him and he\ncalled me back and made me sit down again.\n\n\"Macumazahn,\" he said, \"I would add a word. When you were quite a lad\nyou came into this country with Retief, did you not?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered slowly, for this matter of the massacre of Retief is\none of which I have seldom cared to speak, for sundry reasons, although\nI have made a record of it in writing.[*] Even my friends Sir Henry\nCurtis and Captain Good have heard little of the part I played in that\ntragedy. \"But what do you know of that business, Zikali?\"\n\n     [*--Published under the title of \"Marie.\"--EDITOR.]\n\n\"All that there is to know, I think, Macumazahn, seeing that I was at\nthe bottom of it, and that Dingaan killed those Boers on my advice--just\nas he killed Chaka and Umhlangana.\"\n\n\"You cold-blooded old murderer--\" I began, but he interrupted me at\nonce.\n\n\"Why do you throw evil names at me, Macumazahn, as I threw the stone of\nyour fate at you just now? Why am I a murderer because I brought about\nthe death of some white men that chanced to be your friends, who had\ncome here to cheat us black folk of our country?\"\n\n\"Was it for _this_ reason that you brought about their deaths, Zikali?\"\nI asked, staring him in the face, for I felt that he was lying to me.\n\n\"Not altogether, Macumazahn,\" he answered, letting his eyes, those\nstrange eyes that could look at the sun without blinking, fall before\nmy gaze. \"Have I not told you that I hate the House of Senzangakona?\nAnd when Retief and his companions were killed, did not the spilling of\ntheir blood mean war to the end between the Zulus and the White Men? Did\nit not mean the death of Dingaan and of thousands of his people, which\nis but a beginning of deaths? Now do you understand?\"\n\n\"I understand that you are a very wicked man,\" I answered with\nindignation.\n\n\"At least _you_ should not say so, Macumazahn,\" he replied in a new\nvoice, one with the ring of truth in it.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because I saved your life on that day. You escaped alone of the White\nMen, did you not? And you never could understand why, could you?\"\n\n\"No, I could not, Zikali. I put it down to what you would call 'the\nspirits.'\"\n\n\"Well, I will tell you. Those spirits of yours wore my kaross,\" and\nhe laughed. \"I saw you with the Boers, and saw, too, that you were of\nanother people--the people of the English. You may have heard at the\ntime that I was doctoring at the Great Place, although I kept out of the\nway and we did not meet, or at least you never knew that we met, for you\nwere--asleep. Also I pitied your youth, for, although you do not believe\nit, I had a little bit of heart left in those days. Also I knew that we\nshould come together again in the after years, as you see we have done\nto-day and shall often do until the end. So I told Dingaan that whoever\ndied you must be spared, or he would bring up the 'people of George'\n[i.e. the English] to avenge you, and your ghost would enter into him\nand pour out a curse upon him. He believed me who did not understand\nthat already so many curses were gathered about his head that one more\nor less made no matter. So you see you were spared, Macumazahn, and\nafterwards you helped to pour out a curse upon Dingaan without becoming\na ghost, which is the reason why Panda likes you so well to-day, Panda,\nthe enemy of Dingaan, his brother. You remember the woman who helped\nyou? Well, I made her do so. How did it go with you afterwards,\nMacumazahn, with you and the Boer maiden across the Buffalo River, to\nwhom you were making love in those days?\"\n\n\"Never mind how it went,\" I replied, springing up, for the old wizard's\ntalk had stirred sad and bitter memories in my heart. \"That time is\ndead, Zikali.\"\n\n\"Is it, Macumazahn? Now, from the look upon your face I should have said\nthat it was still very much alive, as things that happened in our youth\nhave a way of keeping alive. But doubtless I am mistaken, and it is all\nas dead as Dingaan, and as Retief, and as the others, your companions.\nAt least, although you do not believe it, I saved your life on that\nred day, for my own purposes, of course, not because one white life was\nanything among so many in my count. And now go to rest, Macumazahn,\ngo to rest, for although your heart has been awakened by memories this\nevening, I promise that you shall sleep well to-night,\" and throwing the\nlong hair back off his eyes he looked at me keenly, wagging his big head\nto and fro, and burst into another of his great laughs.\n\nSo I went. But, ah! as I went I wept.\n\nAnyone who knew all that story would understand why. But this is not the\nplace to tell it, that tale of my first love and of the terrible events\nwhich befell us in the time of Dingaan. Still, as I say, I have written\nit down, and perhaps one day it will be read.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. THE BUFFALO WITH THE CLEFT HORN\n\n\nI slept very well that night, I suppose because I was so dog-tired\nI could not help it; but next day, on our long walk back to Umbezi's\nkraal, I thought a great deal.\n\nWithout doubt I had seen and heard very strange things, both of the\npast and the present--things that I could not in the least understand.\nMoreover, they were mixed up with all sorts of questions of high Zulu\npolicy, and threw a new light upon events that happened to me and others\nin my youth.\n\nNow, in the clear sunlight, was the time to analyse these things, and\nthis I did in the most logical fashion I could command, although without\nthe slightest assistance from Saduko, who, when I asked him questions,\nmerely shrugged his shoulders.\n\nThese questions, he said, did not interest him; I had wished to see the\nmagic of Zikali, and Zikali had been pleased to show me some very good\nmagic, quite of his best indeed. Also he had conversed alone with me\nafterwards, doubtless on high matters--so high that he, Saduko, was not\nadmitted to share the conversation--which was an honour he accorded\nto very few. I could form my own conclusions in the light of the White\nMan's wisdom, which everyone knew was great.\n\nI replied shortly that I could, for Saduko's tone irritated me. Of\ncourse, the truth was that he felt aggrieved at being sent off to\nbed like a little boy while his foster-father, the old dwarf, made\nconfidences to me. One of Saduko's faults was that he had always a very\ngood opinion of himself. Also he was by nature terribly jealous, even in\nlittle things, as the readers of his history, if any, will learn.\n\nWe trudged on for several hours in silence, broken at length by my\ncompanion.\n\n\"Do you still mean to go on a shooting expedition with Umbezi, Inkoosi?\"\nhe asked, \"or are you afraid?\"\n\n\"Of what should I be afraid?\" I answered tartly.\n\n\"Of the buffalo with the split horn, of which Zikali told you. What\nelse?\"\n\nNow, I fear I used strong language about the buffalo with the split\nhorn, a beast in which I declared I had no belief whatsoever, either\nwith or without its accessories of dried river-beds and water-holes.\n\n\"If all this old woman's talk has made _you_ afraid, however,\" I added,\n\"you can stop at the kraal with Mameena.\"\n\n\"Why should the talk make me afraid, Macumazahn? Zikali did not say that\nthis evil spirit of a buffalo would hurt _me_. If I fear, it is for you,\nseeing that if you are hurt you may not be able to go with me to look\nfor Bangu's cattle.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" I replied sarcastically; \"it seems that you are somewhat selfish,\nfriend Saduko, since it is of your welfare and not of my safety that you\nare thinking.\"\n\n\"If I were as selfish as you seem to believe, Inkoosi, should I advise\nyou to stop with your wagons, and thereby lose the good gun with two\nmouths that you have promised me? Still, it is true that I should like\nwell enough to stay at Umbezi's kraal with Mameena, especially if Umbezi\nwere away.\"\n\nNow, as there is nothing more uninteresting than to listen to\nother people's love affairs, and as I saw that with the slightest\nencouragement Saduko was ready to tell me all the history of his\ncourtship over again, I did not continue the argument. So we finished\nour journey in silence, and arrived at Umbezi's kraal a little after\nsundown, to find, to the disappointment of both of us, that Mameena was\nstill away.\n\nUpon the following morning we started on our shooting expedition, the\nparty consisting of myself, my servant Scowl, who, as I think I said,\nhailed from the Cape and was half a Hottentot; Saduko; the merry old\nZulu, Umbezi, and a number of his men to serve as bearers and beaters.\nIt proved a very successful trip--that is, until the end of it--for in\nthose days the game in this part of the country was extremely plentiful.\nBefore the end of the second week I killed four elephants, two of them\nwith large tusks, while Saduko, who soon developed into a very fair\nshot, bagged another with the double-barrelled gun that I had promised\nhim. Also, Umbezi--how, I have never discovered, for the thing partook\nof the nature of a miracle--managed to slay an elephant cow with fair\nivories, using the old rifle that went off at half-cock.\n\nNever have I seen a man, black or white, so delighted as was that\nvainglorious Kafir. For whole hours he danced and sang and took snuff\nand saluted with his hand, telling me the story of his deed over and\nover again, no single version of which tale agreed with the other. He\ntook a new title also, that meant \"Eater-up-of-Elephants\"; he allowed\none of his men to \"bonga\"--that is, praise--him all through the night,\npreventing us from getting a wink of sleep, until at last the poor\nfellow dropped in a kind of fit from exhaustion, and so forth. It really\nwas very amusing until it became a bore.\n\nBesides the elephants we killed lots of other things, including two\nlions, which I got almost with a right and left, and three white\nrhinoceroses, that now, alas! are nearly extinct. At last, towards the\nend of the third week, we had as much as our men could carry in the\nshape of ivory, rhinoceros horns, skins and sun-dried buckflesh, or\nbiltong, and determined to start back for Umbezi's kraal next day.\nIndeed, this could not be long delayed, as our powder and lead were\nrunning low; for in those days, it will be remembered, breechloaders had\nnot come in, and ammunition, therefore, had to be carried in bulk.\n\nTo tell the truth, I was very glad that our trip had come to such a\nsatisfactory conclusion, for, although I would not admit it even to\nmyself, I could not get rid of a kind of sneaking dread lest after\nall there might be something in the old dwarf's prophecy about a\ndisagreeable adventure with a buffalo which was in store for me. Well,\nas it chanced, we had not so much as seen a buffalo, and as the road\nwhich we were going to take back to the kraal ran over high, bare\ncountry that these animals did not frequent, there was now little\nprospect of our doing so--all of which, of course, showed what I already\nknew, that only weak-headed superstitious idiots would put the slightest\nfaith in the drivelling nonsense of deceiving or self-deceived Kafir\nmedicine-men. These things, indeed, I pointed out with much vigour to\nSaduko before we turned in on the last night of the hunt.\n\nSaduko listened in silence and said nothing at all, except that he would\nnot keep me up any longer, as I must be tired.\n\nNow, whatever may be the reason for it, my experience in life is that it\nis never wise to brag about anything. At any rate, on a hunting trip, to\ncome to a particular instance, wait until you are safe at home till you\nbegin to do so. Of the truth of this ancient adage I was now destined to\nexperience a particularly fine and concrete example.\n\nThe place where we had camped was in scattered bush overlooking a great\nextent of dry reeds, that in the wet season was doubtless a swamp fed by\na small river which ran into it on the side opposite to our camp. During\nthe night I woke up, thinking that I heard some big beasts moving in\nthese reeds; but as no further sounds reached my ears I went to sleep\nagain.\n\nShortly after dawn I was awakened by a voice calling me, which in a hazy\nfashion I recognised as that of Umbezi.\n\n\"Macumazahn,\" said the voice in a hoarse whisper, \"the reeds below us\nare full of buffalo. Get up. Get up at once.\"\n\n\"What for?\" I answered. \"If the buffalo came into the reeds they will go\nout of them. We do not want meat.\"\n\n\"No, Macumazahn; but I want their hides. Panda, the King, has demanded\nfifty shields of me, and without killing oxen that I can ill spare I\nhave not the skins whereof to make them. Now, these buffalo are in a\ntrap. This swamp is like a dish with one mouth. They cannot get out\nat the sides of the dish, and the mouth by which they came in is very\nnarrow. If we station ourselves at either side of it we can kill many of\nthem.\"\n\nBy this time I was thoroughly awake and had arisen from my blankets.\nThrowing a kaross over my shoulders, I left the hut, made of boughs,\nin which I was sleeping and walked a few paces to the crest of a rocky\nridge, whence I could see the dry vlei below. Here the mists of dawn\nstill clung, but from it rose sounds of grunts, bellows and tramplings\nwhich I, an old hunter, could not mistake. Evidently a herd of buffalo,\none or two hundred of them, had established themselves in those reeds.\n\nJust then my bastard servant, Scowl, and Saduko joined us, both of them\nfull of excitement.\n\nIt appeared that Scowl, who never seemed to sleep at any natural time,\nhad seen the buffalo entering the reeds, and estimated their number at\ntwo or three hundred. Saduko had examined the cleft through which they\npassed, and reported it to be so narrow that we could kill any number of\nthem as they rushed out to escape.\n\n\"Quite so. I understand,\" I said. \"Well, my opinion is that we had\nbetter let them escape. Only four of us, counting Umbezi, are armed with\nguns, and assegais are not of much use against buffalo. Let them go, I\nsay.\"\n\nUmbezi, thinking of a cheap raw material for the shields which had been\nrequisitioned by the King, who would surely be pleased if they were made\nof such a rare and tough hide as that of buffalo, protested\nviolently, and Saduko, either to please one whom he hoped might be his\nfather-in-law or from sheer love of sport, for which he always had a\npositive passion, backed him up. Only Scowl--whose dash of Hottentot\nblood made him cunning and cautious--took my side, pointing out that we\nwere very short of powder and that buffalo \"ate up much lead.\" At last\nSaduko said:\n\n\"The lord Macumazana is our captain; we must obey him, although it is a\npity. But doubtless the prophesying of Zikali weighs upon his mind, so\nthere is nothing to be done.\"\n\n\"Zikali!\" exclaimed Umbezi. \"What has the old dwarf to do with this\nmatter?\"\n\n\"Never mind what he has or has not to do with it,\" I broke in, for\nalthough I do not think that he meant them as a taunt, but merely as a\nstatement of fact, Saduko's words stung me to the quick, especially as\nmy conscience told me that they were not altogether without foundation.\n\n\"We will try to kill some of these buffalo,\" I went on, \"although,\nunless the herd should get bogged, which is not likely, as the swamp is\nvery dry, I do not think that we can hope for more than eight or ten at\nthe most, which won't be of much use for shields. Come, let us make a\nplan. We have no time to lose, for I think they will begin to move again\nbefore the sun is well up.\"\n\nHalf an hour later the four of us who were armed with guns were posted\nbehind rocks on either side of the steep, natural roadway cut by water,\nwhich led down to the vlei, and with us some of Umbezi's men. That chief\nhimself was at my side--a post of honour which he had insisted upon\ntaking. To tell the truth, I did not dissuade him, for I thought that\nI should be safer so than if he were opposite to me, since, even if the\nold rifle did not go off of its own accord, Umbezi, when excited, was a\nmost uncertain shot. The herd of buffalo appeared to have lain down in\nthe reeds, so, being careful to post ourselves first, we sent three of\nthe native bearers to the farther side of the vlei, with instructions to\nrouse the beasts by shouting. The remainder of the Zulus--there were ten\nor a dozen of them armed with stabbing spears--we kept with us.\n\nBut what did these scoundrels do? Instead of disturbing the herd\nby making a noise, as we told them, for some reason best known to\nthemselves--I expect it was because they were afraid to go into the\nvlei, where they might meet the horn of a buffalo at any moment--they\nfired the dry reeds in three or four places at once, and this, if you\nplease, with a strong wind blowing from them to us. In a minute or two\nthe farther side of the swamp was a sheet of crackling flame that gave\noff clouds of dense white smoke. Then pandemonium began.\n\nThe sleeping buffalo leapt to their feet, and, after a few moments of\nindecision, crashed towards us, the whole huge herd of them, snorting\nand bellowing like mad things. Seeing what was about to happen, I nipped\nbehind a big boulder, while Scowl shinned up a mimosa with the swiftness\nof a cat and, heedless of its thorns, sat himself in an eagle's nest\nat the top. The Zulus with the spears bolted to take cover where they\ncould. What became of Saduko I did not see, but old Umbezi, bewildered\nwith excitement, jumped into the exact middle of the roadway, shouting:\n\n\"They come! They come! Charge, buffalo folk, if you will. The\nEater-up-of-Elephants awaits you!\"\n\n\"You etceterad old fool!\" I shouted, but got no farther, for just at\nthis moment the first of the buffalo, which I could see was an enormous\nbull, probably the leader of the herd, accepted Umbezi's invitation and\ncame, with its nose stuck straight out in front of it. Umbezi's gun went\noff, and next instant he went up. Through the smoke I saw his black bulk\nin the air, and then heard it alight with a thud on the top of the rock\nbehind which I was crouching.\n\n\"Exit Umbezi,\" I said to myself, and by way of a requiem let the bull\nwhich had hoisted him, as I thought to heaven, have an ounce of lead\nin the ribs as it passed me. After that I did not fire any more, for it\noccurred to me that it was as well not to further advertise my presence.\n\nIn all my hunting experience I cannot remember ever seeing such a sight\nas that which followed. Out of the vlei rushed the buffalo by dozens,\nevery one of them making remarks in its own language as it came. They\njammed in the narrow roadway, they leapt on to each other's backs. They\nsquealed, they kicked, they bellowed. They charged my friendly rock till\nI felt it shake. They knocked over Scowl's mimosa thorn, and would have\nshot him out of his eagle's nest had not its flat top fortunately caught\nin that of another and less accessible tree. And with them came clouds\nof pungent smoke, mixed with bits of burning reed and puffs of hot air.\n\nIt was over at last. With the exception of some calves, which had been\ntrampled to death in the rush, the herd had gone. Now, like the Roman\nemperor--I think he was an emperor--I began to wonder what had become of\nmy legions.\n\n\"Umbezi,\" I shouted, or, rather, sneezed through the smoke, \"are you\ndead, Umbezi?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, Macumazahn,\" replied a choking and melancholy voice from the\ntop of the rock, \"I am dead, quite dead. That evil spirit of a silwana\n[i.e. wild beast] has killed me. Oh! why did I think I was a hunter; why\ndid I not stop at my kraal and count my cattle?\"\n\n\"I am sure I don't know, you old lunatic,\" I answered, as I scrambled up\nthe rock to bid him good-bye.\n\nIt was a rock with a razor top like the ridge of a house, and\nthere, hanging across this ridge like a pair of nether garments on a\nclothes-line, I found the \"Eater-up-of-Elephants.\"\n\n\"Where did he get you, Umbezi?\" I asked, for I could not see his wounds\nbecause of the smoke.\n\n\"Behind, Macumazahn, behind!\" he groaned, \"for I had turned to fly, but,\nalas! too late.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" I replied, \"for one so heavy you flew very well; like\na bird, Umbezi, like a bird.\"\n\n\"Look and see what the evil beast has done to me, Macumazahn. It will be\neasy, for my moocha has gone.\"\n\nSo I looked, examining Umbezi's ample proportions with care, but could\ndiscover nothing except a large smudge of black mud, as though he had\nsat down in a half-dried puddle. Then I guessed the truth. The buffalo's\nhorns had missed him. He had been struck only with its muddy nose,\nwhich, being almost as broad as that portion of Umbezi with which it\ncame in contact, had inflicted nothing worse than a bruise. When I was\nsure he had received no serious injury, my temper, already sorely tried,\ngave out, and I administered to him the soundest smacking--his position\nbeing very convenient--that he had ever received since he was a little\nboy.\n\n\"Get up, you idiot!\" I shouted, \"and let us look for the others. This\nis the end of your folly in making me attack a herd of buffalo in reeds.\nGet up. Am I to stop here till I choke?\"\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me that I have no mortal wound, Macumazahn?\" he\nasked, with a return of cheerfulness, accepting the castigation in good\npart, for he was not one who bore malice. \"Oh, I am glad to hear it, for\nnow I shall live to make those cowards who fired the reeds sorry that\nthey are not dead; also to finish off that wild beast, for I hit him,\nMacumazahn, I hit him.\"\n\n\"I don't know whether you hit him; I know he hit you,\" I replied, as I\nshoved him off the rock and ran towards the tilted tree where I had last\nseen Scowl.\n\nHere I beheld another strange sight. Scowl was still seated in the\neagle's nest that he shared with two nearly fledged young birds, one of\nwhich, having been injured, was uttering piteous cries. Nor did it cry\nin vain, for its parents, which were of that great variety of kite that\nthe Boers call \"lammefange\", or lamb-lifters, had just arrived to its\nassistance, and were giving their new nestling, Scowl, the best doing\nthat man ever received at the beak and claws of feathered kind. Seen\nthrough those rushing smoke wreaths, the combat looked perfectly\ntitanic; also it was one of the noisiest to which I ever listened, for\nI don't know which shrieked the more loudly, the infuriated eagles or\ntheir victim.\n\nSeeing how things stood, I burst into a roar of laughter, and just then\nScowl grabbed the leg of the male bird, that was planted in his breast\nwhile it removed tufts of his wool with its hooked beak, and leapt\nboldly from the nest, which had become too hot to hold him. The eagle's\noutspread wings broke his fall, for they acted as a parachute; and so\ndid Umbezi, upon whom he chanced to land. Springing from the prostrate\nshape of the chief, who now had a bruise in front to match that behind,\nScowl, covered with pecks and scratches, ran like a lamp-lighter,\nleaving me to collect my second gun, which he had dropped at the bottom\nof the tree, but fortunately without injuring it. The Kafirs\ngave him another name after that encounter, which meant\n\"He-who-fights-birds-and-gets-the-worst-of-it.\"\n\nWell, we escaped from the line of the smoke, a dishevelled trio--indeed,\nUmbezi had nothing left on him except his head ring--and shouted for the\nothers, if perchance they had not been trodden to death in the rush. The\nfirst to arrive was Saduko, who looked quite calm and untroubled, but\nstared at us in astonishment, and asked coolly what we had been doing\nto get in such a state. I replied in appropriate language, and asked in\nturn how he had managed to remain so nicely dressed.\n\nHe did not answer, but I believe the truth was that he had crept into\na large ant-bear's hole--small blame to him, to be frank. Then the\nremainder of our party turned up one by one, some of them looking very\nblown, as though they had run a long way. None were missing, except\nthose who had fired the reeds, and they thought it well to keep clear\nfor a good many hours. I believe that afterwards they regretted not\nhaving taken a longer leave of absence; but when they finally did\narrive I was in no condition to note what passed between them and their\noutraged chief.\n\nBeing collected, the question arose what we should do. Of course, I\nwished to return to camp and get out of this ill-omened place as soon\nas possible. But I had reckoned without the vanity of Umbezi. Umbezi\nstretched over the edge of a sharp rock, whither he had been hoisted by\nthe nose of a buffalo, and imagining himself to be mortally wounded,\nwas one thing; but Umbezi in a borrowed moocha, although, because of\nhis bruises, he supported his person with one hand in front and with the\nother behind, knowing his injuries to be purely superficial, was quite\nanother.\n\n\"I am a hunter,\" he said; \"I am named 'Eater-up-of-Elephants';\" and\nhe rolled his eyes, looking about for someone to contradict him, which\nnobody did. Indeed, his \"praiser,\" a thin, tired-looking person, whose\nvoice was worn out with his previous exertions, repeated in a feeble\nway:\n\n\"Yes, Black One, 'Eater-up-of-Elephants' is your name;\n'Lifted-up-by-Buffalo' is your name.\"\n\n\"Be silent, idiot,\" roared Umbezi. \"As I said, I am a hunter; I have\nwounded the wild beast that subsequently dared to assault me. [As a\nmatter of fact, it was I, Allan Quatermain, who had wounded it.] I would\nmake it bite the dust, for it cannot be far away. Let us follow it.\"\n\nHe glared round him, whereon his obsequious people, or one of them,\nechoed:\n\n\"Yes, by all means let us follow it, 'Eater-up-of-Elephants.'\nMacumazahn, the clever white man, will show us how, for where is the\nbuffalo that he fears!\"\n\nOf course, after this there was nothing else to be done, so, having\nsummoned the scratched Scowl, who seemed to have no heart in the\nbusiness, we started on the spoor of the herd, which was as easy to\ntrack as a wagon road.\n\n\"Never mind, Baas,\" said Scowl, \"they are two hours' march off by now.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" I answered; but, as it happened, luck was against me, for\nbefore we had covered half a mile some over-zealous fellow struck a\nblood spoor.\n\nI marched on that spoor for twenty minutes or so, till we came to a\npatch of bush that sloped downwards to a river-bed. Right to this river\nI followed it, till I reached the edge of a big pool that was still full\nof water, although the river itself had gone dry. Here I stood looking\nat the spoor and consulting with Saduko as to whether the beast could\nhave swum the pool, for the tracks that went to its very verge had\nbecome confused and uncertain. Suddenly our doubts were ended, since\nout of a patch of dense bush which we had passed--for it had played the\ncommon trick of doubling back on its own spoor--appeared the buffalo, a\nhuge bull, that halted on three legs, my bullet having broken one of its\nthighs. As to its identity there was no doubt, since on, or rather from,\nits right horn, which was cleft apart at the top, hung the remains of\nUmbezi's moocha.\n\n\"Oh, beware, Inkoosi,\" cried Saduko in a frightened voice. _\"It is the\nbuffalo with the cleft horn!\"_\n\nI heard him; I saw. All the scene in the hut of Zikali rose before\nme--the old dwarf, his words, everything. I lifted my rifle and fired at\nthe charging beast, but knew that the bullet glanced from its skull. I\nthrew down the gun--for the buffalo was right on me--and tried to jump\naside.\n\nAlmost I did so, but that cleft horn, to which hung the remains\nof Umbezi's moocha, scooped me up and hurled me off the river bank\nbackwards and sideways into the deep pool below. As I departed thither I\nsaw Saduko spring forward and heard a shot fired that caused the bull to\ncollapse for a moment. Then with a slow, sliding motion it followed me\ninto the pool.\n\nNow we were together, and there was no room for both, so after a certain\namount of dodging I went under, as the lighter dog always does in a\nfight. That buffalo seemed to do everything to me which a buffalo\ncould do under the circumstances. It tried to horn me, and partially\nsucceeded, although I ducked at each swoop. Then it struck me with its\nnose and drove me to the bottom of the pool, although I got hold of its\nlip and twisted it. Then it calmly knelt on me and sank me deeper and\ndeeper into the mud. I remember kicking it in the stomach. After this I\nremember no more, except a kind of wild dream in which I rehearsed\nall the scene in the dwarf's hut, and his request that when I met the\nbuffalo with the cleft horn in the pool of a dried river, I should\nremember that he was nothing but a \"poor old Kafir cheat.\"\n\nAfter this I saw my mother bending over a little child in my bed in the\nold house in Oxfordshire where I was born, and then--blackness!\n\n\nI came to myself again and saw, instead of my mother, the stately figure\nof Saduko bending over me upon one side, and on the other that of Scowl,\nthe half-bred Hottentot, who was weeping, for his hot tears fell upon my\nface.\n\n\"He is gone,\" said poor Scowl; \"that bewitched beast with the split\nhorn has killed him. He is gone who was the best white man in all South\nAfrica, whom I loved better than my father and all my relatives.\"\n\n\"That you might easily do, Bastard,\" answered Saduko, \"seeing that you\ndo not know who they are. But he is not gone, for the 'Opener-of-Roads'\nsaid that he would live; also I got my spear into the heart of that\nbuffalo before he had kneaded the life out of him, as fortunately the\nmud was soft. Yet I fear that his ribs are broken\"; and he poked me with\nhis finger on the breast.\n\n\"Take your clumsy hand off me,\" I gasped.\n\n\"There!\" said Saduko, \"I have made him feel. Did I not tell you that he\nwould live?\"\n\n\nAfter this I remember little more, except some confused dreams, till I\nfound myself lying in a great hut, which I discovered subsequently was\nUmbezi's own, the same, indeed, wherein I had doctored the ear of that\nwife of his who was called \"Worn-out-old-Cow.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. MAMEENA\n\n\nFor a while I contemplated the roof and sides of the hut by the light\nwhich entered it through the smoke-vent and the door-hole, wondering\nwhose it might be and how I came there.\n\nThen I tried to sit up, and instantly was seized with agony in the\nregion of the ribs, which I found were bound about with broad strips of\nsoft tanned hide. Clearly they, or some of them, were broken.\n\nWhat had broken them? I asked myself, and in a flash everything\ncame back to me. So I had escaped with my life, as the old dwarf,\n\"Opener-of-Roads,\" had told me that I should. Certainly he was an\nexcellent prophet; and if he spoke truth in this matter, why not in\nothers? What was I to make of it all? How could a black savage, however\nancient, foresee the future?\n\nBy induction from the past, I supposed; and yet what amount of induction\nwould suffice to show him the details of a forthcoming accident that\nwas to happen to me through the agency of a wild beast with a peculiarly\nshaped horn? I gave it up, as before and since that day I have found it\nnecessary to do in the case of many other events in life. Indeed,\nthe question is one that I often have had cause to ask where Kafir\n\"witch-doctors\" or prophets are concerned, notably in the instance of a\ncertain Mavovo, of whom I hope to tell one day, whose predictions saved\nmy life and those of my companions.\n\nJust then I heard the sound of someone creeping through the bee-hole\nof the hut, and half-closed my eyes, as I did not feel inclined for\nconversation. The person came and stood over me, and somehow--by\ninstinct, I suppose--I became aware that my visitor was a woman. Very\nslowly I lifted my eyelids, just enough to enable me to see her.\n\nThere, standing in a beam of golden light that, passing through the\nsmoke-hole, pierced the soft gloom of the hut, stood the most beautiful\ncreature that I had ever seen--that is, if it be admitted that a person\nwho is black, or rather copper-coloured, can be beautiful.\n\nShe was a little above the medium height, not more, with a figure that,\nso far as I am a judge of such matters, was absolutely perfect--that of\na Greek statue indeed. On this point I had an opportunity of forming an\nopinion, since, except for her little bead apron and a single string\nof large blue beads about her throat, her costume was--well, that of\na Greek statue. Her features showed no trace of the negro type; on the\ncontrary, they were singularly well cut, the nose being straight and\nfine and the pouting mouth that just showed the ivory teeth between,\nvery small. Then the eyes, large, dark and liquid, like those of a\nbuck, set beneath a smooth, broad forehead on which the curling, but not\nwoolly, hair grew low. This hair, by the way, was not dressed up in any\nof the eccentric native fashions, but simply parted in the middle and\ntied in a big knot over the nape of the neck, the little ears peeping\nout through its tresses. The hands, like the feet, were very small and\ndelicate, and the curves of the bust soft and full without being coarse,\nor even showing the promise of coarseness.\n\nA lovely woman, truly; and yet there was something not quite pleasing\nabout that beautiful face; something, notwithstanding its childlike\noutline, which reminded me of a flower breaking into bloom, that one\ndoes not associate with youth and innocence. I tried to analyse what\nthis might be, and came to the conclusion that without being hard, it\nwas too clever and, in a sense, too reflective. I felt even then that\nthe brain within the shapely head was keen and bright as polished steel;\nthat this woman was one made to rule, not to be man's toy, or even his\nloving companion, but to use him for her ends.\n\nShe dropped her chin till it hid the little, dimple-like depression\nbelow her throat, which was one of her charms, and began not to look at,\nbut to study me, seeing which I shut my eyes tight and waited. Evidently\nshe thought that I was still in my swoon, for now she spoke to herself\nin a low voice that was soft and sweet as honey.\n\n\"A small man,\" she said; \"Saduko would make two of him, and the\nother\"--who was he, I wondered--\"three. His hair, too, is ugly; he cuts\nit short and it sticks up like that on a cat's back. Iya!\" (i.e.\nPiff!), and she moved her hand contemptuously, \"a feather of a man. But\nwhite--white, one of those who rule. Why, they all of them know that he\nis their master. They call him 'He-who-never-Sleeps.' They say that he\nhas the courage of a lioness with young--he who got away when Dingaan\nkilled Piti [Retief] and the Boers; they say that he is quick and\ncunning as a snake, and that Panda and his great indunas think more of\nhim than of any white man they know. He is unmarried also, though they\nsay, too, that twice he had a wife, who died, and now he does not turn\nto look at women, which is strange in any man, and shows that he will\nescape trouble and succeed. Still, it must be remembered that they are\nall ugly down here in Zululand, cows, or heifers who will be cows. Piff!\nno more.\"\n\nShe paused for a little while, then went on in her dreamy, reflective\nvoice:\n\n\"Now, if he met a woman who is not merely a cow or a heifer, a woman\ncleverer than himself, even if she were not white, I wonder--\"\n\nAt this point I thought it well to wake up. Turning my head I yawned,\nopened my eyes and looked at her vaguely, seeing which her expression\nchanged in a flash from that of brooding power to one of moved and\nanxious girlhood; in short, it became most sweetly feminine.\n\n\"You are Mameena?\" I said; \"is it not so?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, Inkoosi,\" she answered, \"that is my poor name. But how did you\nhear it, and how do you know me?\"\n\n\"I heard it from one Saduko\"--here she frowned a little--\"and others,\nand I knew you because you are so beautiful\"--an incautious speech at\nwhich she broke into a dazzling smile and tossed her deer-like head.\n\n\"Am I?\" she asked. \"I never knew it, who am only a common Zulu girl to\nwhom it pleases the great white chief to say kind things, for which I\nthank him\"; and she made a graceful little reverence, just bending\none knee. \"But,\" she went on quickly, \"whatever else I be, I am of no\nknowledge, not fit to tend you who are hurt. Shall I go and send my\noldest mother?\"\n\n\"Do you mean her whom your father calls the 'Worn-out-old-Cow,' and\nwhose ear he shot off?\"\n\n\"Yes, it must be she from the description,\" she answered with a little\nshake of laughter, \"though I never heard him give her that name.\"\n\n\"Or if you did, you have forgotten it,\" I said dryly. \"Well, I think\nnot, thank you. Why trouble her, when you will do quite as well? If\nthere is milk in that gourd, perhaps you will give me a drink of it.\"\n\nShe flew to the bowl like a swallow, and next moment was kneeling at my\nside and holding it to my lips with one hand, while with the other she\nsupported my head.\n\n\"I am honoured,\" she said. \"I only came to the hut the moment before\nyou woke, and seeing you still lost in swoon, I wept--look, my eyes are\nstill wet [they were, though how she made them so I do not know]--for I\nfeared lest that sleep should be but the beginning of the last.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" I said; \"it is very good of you. And now, since your fears\nare groundless--thanks be to the heavens--sit down, if you will, and\ntell me the story of how I came here.\"\n\nShe sat down, not, I noted, as a Kafir woman ordinarily does, in a kind\nof kneeling position, but on a stool.\n\n\"You were carried into the kraal, Inkoosi,\" she said, \"on a litter of\nboughs. My heart stood still when I saw that litter coming; it was no\nmore heart; it was cold iron, because I thought the dead or injured man\nwas--\" And she paused.\n\n\"Saduko?\" I suggested.\n\n\"Not at all, Inkoosi--my father.\"\n\n\"Well, it wasn't either of them,\" I said, \"so you must have felt happy.\"\n\n\"Happy! Inkoosi, when the guest of our house had been wounded, perhaps\nto death--the guest of whom I have heard so much, although by misfortune\nI was absent when he arrived.\"\n\n\"A difference of opinion with your eldest mother?\" I suggested.\n\n\"Yes, Inkoosi; my own is dead, and I am not too well treated here. She\ncalled me a witch.\"\n\n\"Did she?\" I answered. \"Well, I do not altogether wonder at it; but\nplease continue your story.\"\n\n\"There is none, Inkoosi. They brought you here, they told me how the\nevil brute of a buffalo had nearly killed you in the pool; that is all.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, Mameena; but how did I get out of the pool?\"\n\n\"Oh, it seems that your servant, Sikauli, the bastard, leapt into the\nwater and engaged the attention of the buffalo which was kneading you\ninto the mud, while Saduko got on to its back and drove his assegai down\nbetween its shoulders to the heart, so that it died. Then they pulled\nyou out of the mud, crushed and almost drowned with water, and brought\nyou to life again. But afterwards you became senseless, and so lay\nwandering in your speech until this hour.\"\n\n\"Ah, he is a brave man, is Saduko.\"\n\n\"Like others, neither more nor less,\" she replied with a shrug of her\nrounded shoulders. \"Would you have had him let you die? I think the\nbrave man was he who got in front of the bull and twisted its nose, not\nhe who sat on its back and poked at it with a spear.\"\n\nAt this period in our conversation I became suddenly faint and lost\ncount of things, even of the interesting Mameena. When I awoke again she\nwas gone, and in her place was old Umbezi, who, I noticed, took down\na mat from the side of the hut and folded it up to serve as a cushion\nbefore he sat himself upon the stool.\n\n\"Greeting, Macumazahn,\" he said when he saw that I was awake; \"how are\nyou?\"\n\n\"As well as can be hoped,\" I answered; \"and how are you, Umbezi?\"\n\n\"Oh, bad, Macumazahn; even now I can scarcely sit down, for that bull\nhad a very hard nose; also I am swollen up in front where Sikauli struck\nme when he tumbled out of the tree. Also my heart is cut in two because\nof our losses.\"\n\n\"What losses, Umbezi?\"\n\n\"Wow! Macumazahn, the fire that those low fellows of mine lit got to our\ncamp and burned up nearly everything--the meat, the skins, and even the\nivory, which it cracked so that it is useless. That was an unlucky hunt,\nfor although it began so well, we have come out of it quite naked; yes,\nwith nothing at all except the head of the bull with the cleft horn,\nthat I thought you might like to keep.\"\n\n\"Well, Umbezi, let us be thankful that we have come out with our\nlives--that is, if I am going to live,\" I added.\n\n\"Oh, Macumazahn, you will live without doubt, and be none the worse. Two\nof our doctors--very clever men--have looked at you and said so. One of\nthem tied you up in all those skins, and I promised him a heifer for the\nbusiness, if he cured you, and gave him a goat on account. But you must\nlie here for a month or more, so he says. Meanwhile Panda has sent for\nthe hides which he demanded of me to be made into shields, and I have\nbeen obliged to kill twenty-five of my beasts to provide them--that is,\nof my own and of those of my headmen.\"\n\n\"Then I wish you and your headmen had killed them before we met those\nbuffalo, Umbezi,\" I groaned, for my ribs were paining me very much.\n\"Send Saduko and Sikauli here; I would thank them for saving my life.\"\n\nSo they came, next morning, I think, and I thanked them warmly enough.\n\n\"There, there, Baas,\" said Scowl, who was literally weeping tears of joy\nat my return from delirium and coma to the light of life and reason; not\ntears of Mameena's sort, but real ones, for I saw them running down his\nsnub nose, that still bore marks of the eagle's claws. \"There, there,\nsay no more, I beseech you. If you were going to die, I wished to die,\ntoo, who, if you had left it, should only have wandered through the\nworld without a heart. That is why I jumped into the pool, not because I\nam brave.\"\n\nWhen I heard this my own eyes grew moist. Oh, it is the fashion to abuse\nnatives, but from whom do we meet with more fidelity and love than from\nthese poor wild Kafirs that so many of us talk of as black dirt which\nchances to be fashioned to the shape of man?\n\n\"As for myself, Inkoosi,\" added Saduko, \"I only did my duty. How could\nI have held up my head again if the bull had killed you while I walked\naway alive? Why, the very girls would have mocked at me. But, oh, his\nskin was tough. I thought that assegai would never get through it.\"\n\nObserve the difference between these two men's characters. The one,\nalthough no hero in daily life, imperils himself from sheer, dog-like\nfidelity to a master who had given him many hard words and sometimes\na flogging in punishment for drunkenness, and the other to gratify his\npride, also perhaps because my death would have interfered with his\nplans and ambitions in which I had a part to play. No, that is a hard\nsaying; still, there is no doubt that Saduko always first took his own\ninterests into consideration, and how what he did would reflect upon\nhis prospects and repute, or influence the attainment of his desires. I\nthink this was so even when Mameena was concerned--at any rate, in the\nbeginning--although certainly he always loved her with a single-hearted\npassion that is very rare among Zulus.\n\nPresently Scowl left the hut to prepare me some broth, whereon Saduko at\nonce turned the talk to this subject of Mameena.\n\nHe understood that I had seen her. Did I not think her very beautiful?\n\n\"Yes, very beautiful,\" I answered; \"indeed, the most beautiful Zulu\nwoman I have ever seen.\"\n\nAnd very clever--almost as clever as a white?\n\n\"Yes, and very clever--much cleverer than most whites.\"\n\nAnd--anything else?\n\n\"Yes; very dangerous, and one who could turn like the wind and blow hot\nand blow cold.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" he said, thought a while, then added: \"Well, what do I care how\nshe blows to others, so long as she blows hot to me.\"\n\n\"Well, Saduko, and does she blow hot for you?\"\n\n\"Not altogether, Macumazahn.\" Another pause. \"I think she blows rather\nlike the wind before a great storm.\"\n\n\"That is a biting wind, Saduko, and when we feel it we know that the\nstorm will follow.\"\n\n\"I dare say that the storm will follow, Inkoosi, for she was born in a\nstorm and storm goes with her; but what of that, if she and I stand it\nout together? I love her, and I had rather die with her than live with\nany other woman.\"\n\n\"The question is, Saduko, whether she would rather die with you than\nlive with any other man. Does she say so?\"\n\n\"Inkoosi, Mameena's thought works in the dark; it is like a white ant in\nits tunnel of mud. You see the tunnel which shows that she is thinking,\nbut you do not see the thought within. Still, sometimes, when she\nbelieves that no one beholds or hears her\"--here I bethought me of the\nyoung lady's soliloquy over my apparently senseless self--\"or when she\nis surprised, the true thought peeps out of its tunnel. It did so the\nother day, when I pleaded with her after she had heard that I killed the\nbuffalo with the cleft horn.\n\n\"'Do I love you?' she said. 'I know not for sure. How can I tell? It is\nnot our custom that a maiden should love before she is married, for\nif she did so most marriages would be things of the heart and not of\ncattle, and then half the fathers of Zululand would grow poor and refuse\nto rear girl-children who would bring them nothing. You are brave, you\nare handsome, you are well-born; I would sooner live with you than\nwith any other man I know--that is, if you were rich and, better still,\npowerful. Become rich and powerful, Saduko, and I think that I shall\nlove you.'\n\n\"'I will, Mameena,' I answered; 'but you must wait. The Zulu nation was\nnot fashioned from nothing in a day. First Chaka had to come.'\n\n\"'Ah!' she said, and, my father, her eyes flashed. 'Ah! Chaka! There was\na man! Be another Chaka, Saduko, and I will love you more--more than you\ncan dream of--thus and thus,' and she flung her arms about me and kissed\nme as I was never kissed before, which, as you know, among us is a\nstrange thing for a girl to do. Then she thrust me from her with a\nlaugh, and added: 'As for the waiting, you must ask my father of that.\nAm I not his heifer, to be sold, and can I disobey my father?' And she\nwas gone, leaving me empty, for it seemed as though she took my vitals\nwith her. Nor will she talk thus any more, the white ant who has gone\nback into its tunnel.\"\n\n\"And did you speak to her father?\"\n\n\"Yes, I spoke to him, but in an evil moment, for he had but just killed\nthe cattle to furnish Panda's shields. He answered me very roughly. He\nsaid: 'You see these dead beasts which I and my people must slay for\nthe king, or fall under his displeasure? Well, bring me five times their\nnumber, and we will talk of your marriage with my daughter, who is a\nmaid in some request.'\n\n\"I answered that I understood and would try my best, whereon he became\nmore gentle, for Umbezi has a kindly heart.\n\n\"'My son,' he said, 'I like you well, and since I saw you save\nMacumazahn, my friend, from that mad wild beast of a buffalo I like\nyou better than before. Yet you know my case. I have an old name and\nam called the chief of a tribe, and many live on me. But I am poor, and\nthis daughter of mine is worth much. Such a woman few men have bred.\nWell, I must make the best of her. My son-in-law must be one who will\nprop up my old age, one to whom, in my need or trouble, I could always\ngo as to a dry log,[*] to break off some of its bark to make a fire to\ncomfort me, not one who treads me into the mire as the buffalo did to\nMacumazahn. Now I have spoken, and I do not love such talk. Come back\nwith the cattle, and I will listen to you, but meanwhile understand that\nI am not bound to you or to anyone; I shall take what my spirit sends\nme, which, if I may judge the future by the past, will not be much. One\nword more: Do not linger about this kraal too long, lest it should be\nsaid that you are the accepted suitor of Mameena. Go hence and do a\nman's work, and return with a man's reward, or not at all.'\"\n\n     [*--In Zululand a son-in-law is known as \"isigodo so\n     mkwenyana\", the \"son-in-law log,\" for the reason stated in\n     the text.--EDITOR.]\n\n\"Well, Saduko, that spear has an edge on it, has it not?\" I answered.\n\"And now, what is your plan?\"\n\n\"My plan is, Macumazahn,\" he said, rising from his seat, \"to go hence\nand gather those who are friendly to me because I am my father's son\nand still the chief of the Amangwane, or those who are left of them,\nalthough I have no kraal and no hoof of kine. Then, within a moon, I\nhope, I shall return here to find you strong again and once more a man,\nand we will start out against Bangu, as I have whispered to you, with\nthe leave of a High One, who has said that, if I can take any cattle, I\nmay keep them for my pains.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that, Saduko. I never promised you that I would make\nwar upon Bangu--with or without the king's leave.\"\n\n\"No, you never promised, but Zikali the Dwarf, the Wise Little One, said\nthat you would--and does Zikali lie? Ask yourself, who will remember a\ncertain saying of his about a buffalo with a cleft horn, a pool and a\ndry river-bed. Farewell, O my father Macumazahn; I walk with the dawn,\nand I leave Mameena in your keeping.\"\n\n\"You mean that you leave me in Mameena's keeping,\" I began, but already\nhe was crawling through the hole in the hut.\n\nWell, Mameena kept me very comfortably. She was always in evidence, yet\nnot too much so.\n\nHeedless of her malice and abuse, she headed off the \"Worn-out-old-Cow,\"\nwhom she knew I detested, from my presence. She saw personally to my\nbandages, as well as to the cooking of my food, over which matter she\nhad several quarrels with the bastard, Scowl, who did not like her,\nfor on him she never wasted any of her sweet looks. Also, as I grew\nstronger, she sat with me a good deal, talking, since, by common\nconsent, Mameena the fair was exempted from all the field, and even\nthe ordinary household labours that fall to the lot of Kafir women. Her\nplace was to be the ornament and, I may add, the advertisement of her\nfather's kraal. Others might do the work, and she saw that they did it.\n\nWe discussed all sorts of things, from the Christian and other religions\nand European policy down, for her thirst for knowledge seemed to be\ninsatiable. But what really interested her was the state of affairs in\nZululand, with which she knew I was well acquainted, as a person who\nhad played a part in its history and who was received and trusted at the\nGreat House, and as a white man who understood the designs and plans of\nthe Boers and of the Governor of Natal.\n\nNow, if the old king, Panda, should chance to die, she would ask me,\nwhich of his sons did I think would succeed him--Umbelazi or Cetewayo,\nor another? Or, if he did not chance to die, which of them would he name\nhis heir?\n\nI replied that I was not a prophet, and that she had better ask Zikali\nthe Wise.\n\n\"That is a very good idea,\" she said, \"only I have no one to take me to\nhim, since my father would not allow me to go with Saduko, his ward.\"\nThen she clapped her hands and added: \"Oh, Macumazahn, will you take me?\nMy father would trust me with you.\"\n\n\"Yes, I dare say,\" I answered; \"but the question is, could I trust\nmyself with you?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked. \"Oh, I understand. Then, after all, I am\nmore to you than a black stone to play with?\"\n\nI think it was that unlucky joke of mine which first set Mameena\nthinking, \"like a white ant in its tunnel,\" as Saduko said. At least,\nafter it her manner towards me changed; she became very deferential;\nshe listened to my words as though they were all wisdom; I caught her\nlooking at me with her soft eyes as though I were quite an admirable\nobject. She began to talk to me of her difficulties, her troubles and\nher ambitions. She asked me for my advice as to Saduko. On this point\nI replied to her that, if she loved him, and her father would allow it,\npresumably she had better marry him.\n\n\"I like him well enough, Macumazahn, although he wearies me at times;\nbut love-- Oh, tell me, _what_ is love?\" Then she clasped her slim hands\nand gazed at me like a fawn.\n\n\"Upon my word, young woman,\" I replied, \"that is a matter upon which I\nshould have thought you more competent to instruct me.\"\n\n\"Oh, Macumazahn,\" she said almost in a whisper, and letting her head\ndroop like a fading lily, \"you have never given me the chance, have\nyou?\" And she laughed a little, looking extremely attractive.\n\n\"Good gracious!\"--or, rather, its Zulu equivalent--I answered, for I\nbegan to feel nervous. \"What do you mean, Mameena? How could I--\" There\nI stopped.\n\n\"I do not know what I mean, Macumazahn,\" she exclaimed wildly, \"but\nI know well enough what you mean--that you are white as snow and I am\nblack as soot, and that snow and soot don't mix well together.\"\n\n\"No,\" I answered gravely, \"snow is good to look at, and so is soot, but\nmingled they make an ugly colour. Not that you are like soot,\" I added\nhastily, fearing to hurt her feelings. \"That is your hue\"--and I touched\na copper bangle she was wearing--\"a very lovely hue, Mameena, like\neverything else about you.\"\n\n\"Lovely,\" she said, beginning to weep a little, which upset me very\nmuch, for if there is one thing I hate, it is to see a woman cry. \"How\ncan a poor Zulu girl be lovely? Oh, Macumazahn, the spirits have dealt\nhardly with me, who have given me the colour of my people and the\nheart of yours. If I were white, now, what you are pleased to call this\nloveliness of mine would be of some use to me, for then-- then-- Oh,\ncannot you guess, Macumazahn?\"\n\nI shook my head and said that I could not, and next moment was sorry,\nfor she proceeded to explain.\n\nSinking to her knees--for we were quite alone in the big hut and there\nwas no one else about, all the other women being engaged on rural or\ndomestic tasks, for which Mameena declared she had no time, as her\nbusiness was to look after me--she rested her shapely head upon my knees\nand began to talk in a low, sweet voice that sometimes broke into a sob.\n\n\"Then I will tell you--I will tell you; yes, even if you hate me\nafterwards. I could teach you what love is very well, Macumazahn; you\nare quite right--because I love you.\" (Sob.) \"No, you shall not stir\ntill you have heard me out.\" Here she flung her arms about my legs and\nheld them tight, so that without using great violence it was absolutely\nimpossible for me to move. \"When I saw you first, all shattered and\nsenseless, snow seemed to fall upon my heart, and it stopped for a\nlittle while and has never been the same since. I think that something\nis growing in it, Macumazahn, that makes it big.\" (Sob.) \"I used to like\nSaduko before that, but afterwards I did not like him at all--no,\nnor Masapo either--you know, he is the big chief who lives over the\nmountain, a very rich and powerful man, who, I believe, would like\nto marry me. Well, as I went on nursing you my heart grew bigger and\nbigger, and now you see it has burst.\" (Sob.) \"Nay, stay still and do\nnot try to speak. You _shall_ hear me out. It is the least you can do,\nseeing that you have caused me all this pain. If you did not want me to\nlove you, why did you not curse at me and strike me, as I am told white\nmen do to Kafir girls?\" She rose and went on:\n\n\"Now, hearken. Although I am the colour of copper, I am comely. I am\nwell-bred also; there is no higher blood than ours in Zululand, both on\nmy father's and my mother's side, and, Macumazahn, I have a fire in me\nthat shows me things. I can be great, and I long for greatness. Take me\nto wife, Macumazahn, and I swear to you that in ten years I will make\nyou king of the Zulus. Forget your pale white women and wed yourself to\nthat fire which burns in me, and it shall eat up all that stands between\nyou and the Crown, as flame eats up dry grass. More, I will make you\nhappy. If you choose to take other wives, I will not be jealous, because\nI know that I should hold your spirit, and that, compared to me, they\nwould be nothing in your thought--\"\n\n\"But, Mameena,\" I broke in, \"I don't want to be king of the Zulus.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes, you do, for every man wants power, and it is better to\nrule over a brave, black people--thousands and thousands of them--than\nto be no one among the whites. Think, think! There is wealth in the\nland. By your skill and knowledge the amabuto [regiments] could be\nimproved; with the wealth you would arm them with guns--yes, and\n'by-and-byes' also with the throat of thunder\" (that is, or was, the\nKafir name for cannon).[*] \"They would be invincible. Chaka's kingdom\nwould be nothing to ours, for a hundred thousand warriors would sleep\non their spears, waiting for your word. If you wished it even you could\nsweep out Natal and make the whites there your subjects, too. Or perhaps\nit would be safer to let them be, lest others should come across the\ngreen water to help them, and to strike northwards, where I am told\nthere are great lands as rich and fair, in which none would dispute our\nsovereignty--\"\n\n     [*--Cannon were called \"by-and-byes\" by the natives, because\n     when field-pieces first arrived in Natal inquisitive Kafirs\n     pestered the soldiers to show them how they were fired.\n     The answer given was always \"By-and-bye!\"  Hence the name.--\n     EDITOR]\n\n\"But, Mameena,\" I gasped, for this girl's titanic ambition literally\noverwhelmed me, \"surely you are mad! How would you do all these things?\"\n\n\"I am not mad,\" she answered; \"I am only what is called great, and you\nknow well enough that I can do them, not by myself, who am but a woman\nand tied with the ropes that bind women, but with you to cut those ropes\nand help me. I have a plan which will not fail. But, Macumazahn,\" she\nadded in a changed voice, \"until I know that you will be my partner in\nit I will not tell it even to you, for perhaps you might talk--in your\nsleep, and then the fire in my breast would soon go out--for ever.\"\n\n\"I might talk now, for the matter of that, Mameena.\"\n\n\"No; for men like you do not tell tales of foolish girls who chance to\nlove them. But if that plan began to work, and you heard say that kings\nor princes died, it might be otherwise. You might say, 'I think I\nknow where the witch lives who causes these evils'--in your sleep,\nMacumazahn.\"\n\n\"Mameena,\" I said, \"tell me no more. Setting your dreams on one side,\ncan I be false to my friend, Saduko, who talks to me day and night of\nyou?\"\n\n\"Saduko! Piff!\" she exclaimed, with that expressive gesture of her hand.\n\n\"And can I be false,\" I continued, seeing that Saduko was no good card\nto play, \"to my friend, Umbezi, your father?\"\n\n\"My father!\" she laughed. \"Why, would it not please him to grow great\nin your shadow? Only yesterday he told me to marry you, if I could, for\nthen he would find a stick indeed to lean on, and be rid of Saduko's\ntroubling.\"\n\nEvidently Umbezi was a worse card even than Saduko, so I played another.\n\n\"And can I help you, Mameena, to tread a road that at the best must be\nred with blood?\"\n\n\"Why not,\" she asked, \"since with or without you I am destined to tread\nthat road, the only difference being that with you it will lead to glory\nand without you perhaps to the jackals and the vultures? Blood! Piff!\nWhat is blood in Zululand?\"\n\nThis card also having failed, I tabled my last.\n\n\"Glory or no glory, I do not wish to share it, Mameena. I will not\nmake war among a people who have entertained me hospitably, or plot the\ndownfall of their Great Ones. As you told me just now, I am nobody--just\none grain of sand upon a white shore--but I had rather be that than a\nhaunted rock which draws the heavens' lightnings and is drenched with\nsacrifice. I seek no throne over white or black, Mameena, who walk my\nown path to a quiet grave that shall perhaps not be without honour of\nits own, though other than you seek. I will keep your counsel, Mameena,\nbut, because you are so beautiful and so wise, and because you say you\nare fond of me--for which I thank you--I pray you put away these fearful\ndreams of yours that in the end, whether they succeed or fail, will\nsend you shivering from the world to give account of them to the\nWatcher-on-high.\"\n\n\"Not so, O Macumazana,\" she said, with a proud little laugh. \"When your\nWatcher sowed my seed--if thus he did--he sowed the dreams that are\na part of me also, and I shall only bring him back his own, with the\nflower and the fruit by way of interest. But that is finished. You\nrefuse the greatness. Now, tell me, if I sink those dreams in a great\nwater, tying about them the stone of forgetfulness and saying: 'Sleep\nthere, O dreams; it is not your hour'--if I do this, and stand before\nyou just a woman who loves and who swears by the spirits of her fathers\nnever to think or do that which has not your blessing--will you love me\na little, Macumazahn?\"\n\nNow I was silent, for she had driven me to the last ditch, and I knew\nnot what to say. Moreover, I will confess my weakness--I was strangely\nmoved. This beautiful girl with the \"fire in her heart,\" this woman who\nwas different from all other women that I had ever known, seemed to have\ntwisted her slender fingers into my heart-strings and to be drawing\nme towards her. It was a great temptation, and I bethought me of old\nZikali's saying in the Black Kloof, and seemed to hear his giant laugh.\n\nShe glided up to me, she threw her arms about me and kissed me on the\nlips, and I think I kissed her back, but really I am not sure what I\ndid or said, for my head swam. When it cleared again she was standing in\nfront of me, looking at me reflectively.\n\n\"Now, Macumazahn,\" she said, with a little smile that both mocked and\ndazzled, \"the poor black girl has you, the wise, experienced white man,\nin her net, and I will show you that she can be generous. Do you think\nthat I do not read your heart, that I do not know that you believe I\nam dragging you down to shame and ruin? Well, I spare you, Macumazahn,\nsince you have kissed me and spoken words which already you may have\nforgotten, but which I do not forget. Go your road, Macumazahn, and I\ngo mine, since the proud white man shall not be stained with my black\ntouch. Go your road; but one thing I forbid you--to believe that you\nhave been listening to lies, and that I have merely played off a woman's\narts upon you for my own ends. I love you, Macumazahn, as you will never\nbe loved till you die, and I shall never love any other man, however\nmany I may marry. Moreover, you shall promise me one thing--that once in\nmy life, and once only, if I wish it, you shall kiss me again before all\nmen. And now, lest you should be moved to folly and forget your white\nman's pride, I bid you farewell, O Macumazana. When we meet again it\nwill be as friends only.\"\n\nThen she went, leaving me feeling smaller than ever I felt in my life,\nbefore or since--even smaller than when I walked into the presence of\nold Zikali the Wise. Why, I wondered, had she first made a fool of me,\nand then thrown away the fruits of my folly? To this hour I cannot quite\nanswer the question, though I believe the explanation to be that she did\nreally care for me, and was anxious not to involve me in trouble and her\nplottings; also she may have been wise enough to see that our natures\nwere as oil and water and would never blend.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. TWO BUCKS AND THE DOE\n\n\nIt may be thought that, as a sequel to this somewhat remarkable scene in\nwhich I was absolutely bowled over--perhaps bowled out would be a better\nterm--by a Kafir girl who, after bending me to her will, had the genius\nto drop me before I repented, as she knew I would do so soon as her back\nwas turned, thereby making me look the worst of fools, that my relations\nwith that young lady would have been strained. But not a bit of it. When\nnext we met, which was on the following morning, she was just her easy,\nnatural self, attending to my hurts, which by now were almost well,\njoking about this and that, inquiring as to the contents of certain\nletters which I had received from Natal, and of some newspapers that\ncame with them--for on all such matters she was very curious--and so\nforth.\n\nImpossible, the clever critic will say--impossible that a savage could\nact with such finish. Well, friend critic, that is just where you are\nwrong. When you come to add it up there's very little difference in all\nmain and essential matters between the savage and yourself.\n\nTo begin with, by what exact right do we call people like the Zulus\nsavages? Setting aside the habit of polygamy, which, after all, is\ncommon among very highly civilised peoples in the East, they have a\nsocial system not unlike our own. They have, or had, their king, their\nnobles, and their commons. They have an ancient and elaborate law, and\na system of morality in some ways as high as our own, and certainly more\ngenerally obeyed. They have their priests and their doctors; they are\nstrictly upright, and observe the rites of hospitality.\n\nWhere they differ from us mainly is that they do not get drunk until the\nwhite man teaches them so to do, they wear less clothing, the climate\nbeing more genial, their towns at night are not disgraced by the\nsights that distinguish ours, they cherish and are never cruel to their\nchildren, although they may occasionally put a deformed infant or a twin\nout of the way, and when they go to war, which is often, they carry out\nthe business with a terrible thoroughness, almost as terrible as that\nwhich prevailed in every nation in Europe a few generations ago.\n\nOf course, there remain their witchcraft and the cruelties which result\nfrom their almost universal belief in the power and efficiency of magic.\nWell, since I lived in England I have been reading up this subject, and\nI find that quite recently similar cruelties were practised throughout\nEurope--that is in a part of the world which for over a thousand years\nhas enjoyed the advantages of the knowledge and profession of the\nChristian faith.\n\nNow, let him who is highly cultured take up a stone to throw at the\npoor, untaught Zulu, which I notice the most dissolute and drunken\nwretch of a white man is often ready to do, generally because he covets\nhis land, his labour, or whatever else may be his.\n\nBut I wander from my point, which is that a clever man or woman among\nthe people whom we call savages is in all essentials very much the same\nas a clever man or woman anywhere else.\n\nHere in England every child is educated at the expense of the Country,\nbut I have not observed that the system results in the production of\nmore really able individuals. Ability is the gift of Nature, and that\nuniversal mother sheds her favours impartially over all who breathe.\nNo, not quite impartially, perhaps, for the old Greeks and others were\nexamples to the contrary. Still, the general rule obtains.\n\nTo return. Mameena was a very able person, as she chanced to be a very\nlovely one, a person who, had she been favoured by opportunity, would\ndoubtless have played the part of a Cleopatra with equal or greater\nsuccess, since she shared the beauty and the unscrupulousness of that\nfamous lady and was, I believe, capable of her passion.\n\nI scarcely like to mention the matter since it affects myself, and\nthe natural vanity of man makes him prone to conclude that he is the\nparticular object of sole and undying devotion. Could he know all the\nfacts of the case, or cases, probably he would be much undeceived, and\nfeel about as small as I did when Mameena walked, or rather crawled, out\nof the hut (she could even crawl gracefully). Still, to be honest--and\nwhy should I not, since all this business \"went beyond\" so long\nago?--I do believe that there was a certain amount of truth in what she\nsaid--that, for Heaven knows what reason, she did take a fancy to me,\nwhich fancy continued during her short and stormy life. But the reader\nof her story may judge for himself.\n\nWithin a fortnight of the day of my discomfiture in the hut I was quite\nwell and strong again, my ribs, or whatever part of me it was that the\nbuffalo had injured with his iron knees, having mended up. Also, I was\nanxious to be going, having business to attend to in Natal, and, as no\nmore had been seen or heard of Saduko, I determined to trek homewards,\nleaving a message that he knew where to find me if he wanted me. The\ntruth is that I was by no means keen on being involved in his private\nwar with Bangu. Indeed, I wished to wash my hands of the whole matter,\nincluding the fair Mameena and her mocking eyes.\n\nSo one morning, having already got up my oxen, I told Scowl to inspan\nthem--an order which he received with joy, for he and the other boys\nwished to be off to civilisation and its delights. Just as the operation\nwas beginning, however, a message came to me from old Umbezi, who begged\nme to delay my departure till after noon, as a friend of his, a big\nchief, had come to visit him who wished much to have the honour of\nmaking my acquaintance. Now, I wished the big chief farther off, but, as\nit seemed rude to refuse the request of one who had been so kind to me,\nI ordered the oxen to be unyoked but kept at hand, and in an irritable\nframe of mind walked up to the kraal. This was about half a mile from\nmy place of outspan, for as soon as I was sufficiently recovered I\nhad begun to sleep in my wagon, leaving the big hut to the\n\"Worn-out-Old-Cow.\"\n\nThere was no particular reason why I should be irritated, since time\nin those days was of no great account in Zululand, and it did not much\nmatter to me whether I trekked in the morning or the afternoon. But the\nfact was that I could not get over the prophecy of Zikali, \"the Little\nand Wise,\" that I was destined to share Saduko's expedition against\nBangu, and, although he had been right about the buffalo and Mameena, I\nwas determined to prove him wrong in this particular.\n\nIf I had left the country, obviously I could not go against Bangu, at\nany rate at present. But while I remained in it Saduko might return at\nany moment, and then, doubtless, I should find it hard to escape from\nthe kind of half-promise that I had given to him.\n\nWell, as soon as I reached the kraal I saw that some kind of festivity\nwas in progress, for an ox had been killed and was being cooked, some of\nit in pots and some by roasting; also there were several strange Zulus\npresent. Within the fence of the kraal, seated in its shadow, I found\nUmbezi and some of his headmen, and with them a great, brawny \"ringed\"\nnative, who wore a tiger-skin moocha as a mark of rank, and some of\n_his_ headmen. Also Mameena was standing near the gate, dressed in her\nbest beads and holding a gourd of Kafir beer which, evidently, she had\njust been handing to the guests.\n\n\"Would you have run away without saying good-bye to me, Macumazahn?\" she\nwhispered to me as I came abreast of her. \"That is unkind of you, and I\nshould have wept much. However, it was not so fated.\"\n\n\"I was going to ride up and bid farewell when the oxen were inspanned,\"\nI answered. \"But who is that man?\"\n\n\"You will find out presently, Macumazahn. Look, my father is beckoning\nto us.\"\n\nSo I went on to the circle, and as I advanced Umbezi rose and, taking me\nby the hand, led me to the big man, saying:\n\n\"This is Masapo, chief of the Amansomi, of the Quabe race, who desires\nto know you, Macumazahn.\"\n\n\"Very kind of him, I am sure,\" I replied coolly, as I threw my eye over\nMasapo. He was, as I have said, a big man, and of about fifty years\nof age, for his hair was tinged with grey. To be frank, I took a great\ndislike to him at once, for there was something in his strong, coarse\nface, and his air of insolent pride, which repelled me. Then I was\nsilent, since among the Zulus, when two strangers of more or less equal\nrank meet, he who speaks first acknowledges inferiority to the other.\nTherefore I stood and contemplated this new suitor of Mameena, waiting\non events.\n\nMasapo also contemplated me, then made some remark to one of his\nattendants, that I did not catch, which caused the fellow to laugh.\n\n\"He has heard that you are an ipisi\" (a great hunter), broke in Umbezi,\nwho evidently felt that the situation was growing strained, and that it\nwas necessary to say something.\n\n\"Has he?\" I answered. \"Then he is more fortunate than I am, for I have\nnever heard of him or what he is.\" This, I am sorry to say, was a fib,\nfor it will be remembered that Mameena had mentioned him in the hut as\none of her suitors, but among natives one must keep up one's dignity\nsomehow. \"Friend Umbezi,\" I went on, \"I have come to bid you farewell,\nas I am about to trek for Durban.\"\n\nAt this juncture Masapo stretched out his great hand to me, but without\nrising, and said:\n\n\"Siyakubona [that is, good-day], White Man.\"\n\n\"Siyakubona, Black Man,\" I answered, just touching his fingers, while\nMameena, who had come up again with her beer, and was facing me, made a\nlittle grimace and tittered.\n\nNow I turned on my heel to go, whereon Masapo said in a coarse, growling\nvoice:\n\n\"O Macumazana, before you leave us I wish to speak with you on a certain\nmatter. Will it please you to sit aside with me for a while?\"\n\n\"Certainly, O Masapo.\" And I walked away a few yards out of hearing,\nwhither he followed me.\n\n\"Macumazahn,\" he said (I give the gist of his remarks, for he did not\ncome to the point at once), \"I need guns, and I am told that you can\nprovide them, being a trader.\"\n\n\"Yes, Masapo, I dare say that I can, at a price, though it is a risky\nbusiness smuggling guns into Zululand. But might I ask what you need\nthem for? is it to shoot elephants?\"\n\n\"Yes, to shoot elephants,\" he replied, rolling his big eyes round him.\n\"Macumazahn, I am told that you are discreet, that you do not shout\nfrom the top of a hut what you hear within it. Now, hearken to me. Our\ncountry is disturbed; we do not all of us love the seed of Senzangakona,\nof whom the present king, Panda, is one. For instance, you may know that\nwe Quabies--for my tribe, the Amansomi, are of that race--suffered at\nthe spear of Chaka. Well, we think that a time may come when we who live\non shrubs like goats may again browse on tree-tops like giraffes, for\nPanda is no strong king, and he has sons who hate each other, one of\nwhom may need our spears. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"I understand that you want guns, O Masapo,\" I answered dryly. \"Now, as\nto the price and place of delivery.\"\n\nThen we bargained for a while, but the details of that business\ntransaction of long ago will interest no one. Indeed, I only mention the\nmatter to show that Masapo was plotting to bring trouble on the ruling\nhouse, whereof Panda was the representative at that time.\n\nWhen we had concluded our rather nefarious negotiations, which were to\nthe effect that I was to receive so many cattle in return for so many\nguns, if I could deliver them at a certain spot, namely, Umbezi's kraal,\nI returned to the circle where Umbezi, his followers and guests were\nsitting, purposing to bid him farewell. By now, however, meat had been\nserved, and as I was hungry, having had little breakfast that morning,\nI stayed to eat. When I had finished my meal, and washed it down with a\ndraught of tshwala (that is, Kafir beer), I rose to go, but just at that\nmoment who should walk through the gate but Saduko?\n\n\"Piff!\" said Mameena, who was standing near me, speaking in a voice that\nnone but I could hear. \"When two bucks meet, what happens, Macumazahn?\"\n\n\"Sometimes they fight and sometimes one runs away. It depends very much\non the doe,\" I answered in the same low voice, looking at her.\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders, folded her arms beneath her breast, nodded\nto Saduko as he passed, then leaned gracefully against the fence and\nawaited events.\n\n\"Greeting, Umbezi,\" said Saduko in his proud manner. \"I see that you\nfeast. Am I welcome here?\"\n\n\"Of course you are always welcome, Saduko,\" replied Umbezi uneasily,\n\"although, as it happens, I am entertaining a great man.\" And he looked\ntowards Masapo.\n\n\"I see,\" said Saduko, eyeing the strangers. \"But which of these may be\nthe great man? I ask that I may salute him.\"\n\n\"You know well enough, umfokazana\" (that is, low fellow), exclaimed\nMasapo angrily.\n\n\"I know that if you were outside this fence, Masapo, I would cram that\nword down your throat at the point of my assegai,\" replied Saduko in a\nfierce voice. \"Oh, I can guess your business here, Masapo, and you can\nguess mine,\" and he glanced towards Mameena. \"Tell me, Umbezi, is this\nlittle chief of the Amansomi your daughter's accepted suitor?\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, Saduko,\" said Umbezi; \"no one is her accepted suitor. Will\nyou not sit down and take food with us? Tell us where you have been, and\nwhy you return here thus suddenly, and--uninvited?\"\n\n\"I return here, O Umbezi, to speak with the white chief, Macumazahn. As\nto where I have been, that is my affair, and not yours or Masapo's.\"\n\n\"Now, if I were chief of this kraal,\" said Masapo, \"I would hunt out of\nit this hyena with a mangy coat and without a hole who comes to devour\nyour meat and, perhaps,\" he added with meaning, \"to steal away your\nchild.\"\n\n\"Did I not tell you, Macumazahn, that when two bucks met they would\nfight?\" whispered Mameena suavely into my ear.\n\n\"Yes, Mameena, you did--or rather I told you. But you did not tell me\nwhat the doe would do.\"\n\n\"The doe, Macumazahn, will crouch in her form and see what happens--as\nis the fashion of does,\" and again she laughed softly.\n\n\"Why not do your own hunting, Masapo?\" asked Saduko. \"Come, now, I\nwill promise you good sport. Outside this kraal there are other hyenas\nwaiting who call me chief--a hundred or two of them--assembled for a\ncertain purpose by the royal leave of King Panda, whose House, as we all\nknow, you hate. Come, leave that beef and beer and begin your hunting of\nhyenas, O Masapo.\"\n\nNow Masapo sat silent, for he saw that he who thought to snare a baboon\nhad caught a tiger.\n\n\"You do not speak, O Chief of the little Amansomi,\" went on Saduko, who\nwas beside himself with rage and jealousy. \"You will not leave your beef\nand beer to hunt the hyenas who are captained by an umfokazana! Well,\nthen, the umfokazana will speak,\" and, stepping up to Masapo, with the\nspear he carried poised in his right hand, Saduko grasped his rival's\nshort beard with his left.\n\n\"Listen, Chief,\" he said. \"You and I are enemies. You seek the woman I\nseek, and, mayhap, being rich, you will buy her. But if so, I tell you\nthat I will kill you and all your House, you sneaking, half-bred dog!\"\n\nWith these fierce words he spat in his face and tumbled him backwards.\nThen, before anyone could stop him, for Umbezi, and even Masapo's\nheadmen, seemed paralysed with surprise, he stalked through the kraal\ngate, saying as he passed me:\n\n\"Inkoosi, I have words for you when you are at liberty.\"\n\n\"You shall pay for this,\" roared Umbezi after him, turning almost green\nwith rage, for Masapo still lay upon his broad back, speechless, \"you\nwho dare to insult my guest in my own house.\"\n\n\"Somebody must pay,\" cried back Saduko from the gate, \"but who it is\nonly the unborn moons will see.\"\n\n\"Mameena,\" I said as I followed him, \"you have set fire to the grass,\nand men will be burned in it.\"\n\n\"I meant to, Macumazahn,\" she answered calmly. \"Did I not tell you\nthat there was a flame in me, and it will break out sometimes? But,\nMacumazahn, it is you who have set fire to the grass, not I. Remember\nthat when half Zululand is in ashes. Farewell, O Macumazana, till we\nmeet again, and,\" she added softly, \"whoever else must burn, may the\nspirits have _you_ in their keeping.\"\n\nAt the gate, remembering my manners, I turned to bid that company a\npolite farewell. By now Masapo had gained his feet, and was roaring out\nlike a bull:\n\n\"Kill him! Kill the hyena! Umbezi, will you sit still and see me, your\nguest--me, Masapo--struck and insulted under the shadow of your own hut?\nGo forth and kill him, I say!\"\n\n\"Why not kill him yourself, Masapo,\" asked the agitated Umbezi, \"or\nbid your headmen kill him? Who am I that I should take precedence of\nso great a chief in a matter of the spear?\" Then he turned towards me,\nsaying: \"Oh, Macumazahn the crafty, if I have dealt well by you, come\nhere and give me your counsel.\"\n\n\"I come, Eater-up-of-Elephants,\" I answered, and I did.\n\n\"What shall I do--what shall I do?\" went on Umbezi, brushing the\nperspiration off his brow with one hand, while he wrung the other in his\nagitation. \"There stands a friend of mine\"--he pointed to the infuriated\nMasapo--\"who wishes me to kill another friend of mine,\" and he jerked\nhis thumb towards the kraal gate. \"If I refuse I offend one friend,\nand if I consent I bring blood upon my hands which will call for blood,\nsince, although Saduko is poor, without doubt he has those who love\nhim.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered, \"and perhaps you will bring blood upon other parts of\nyourself besides your hands, since Saduko is not one to sit still like a\nsheep while his throat is cut. Also did he not say that he is not quite\nalone? Umbezi, if you will take my advice, you will leave Masapo to do\nhis own killing.\"\n\n\"It is good; it is wise!\" exclaimed Umbezi. \"Masapo,\" he called to that\nwarrior, \"if you wish to fight, pray do not think of me. I see nothing,\nI hear nothing, and I promise proper burial to any who fall. Only you\nhad best be swift, for Saduko is walking away all this time. Come, you\nand your people have spears, and the gate stands open.\"\n\n\"Am I to go without my meat in order to knock that hyena on the head?\"\nasked Masapo in a brave voice. \"No, he can wait my leisure. Sit still,\nmy people. I tell you, sit still. Tell him, you Macumazahn, that I am\ncoming for him presently, and be warned to keep yourself away from him,\nlest you should tumble into his hole.\"\n\n\"I will tell him,\" I answered, \"though I know not who made me your\nmessenger. But listen to me, you Speaker of big words and Doer of\nsmall deeds, if you dare to lift a finger against me I will teach you\nsomething about holes, for there shall be one or more through that great\ncarcass of yours.\"\n\nThen, walking up to him, I looked him in the face, and at the same time\ntapped the handle of the big double-barrelled pistol I carried.\n\nHe shrank back muttering something.\n\n\"Oh, don't apologise,\" I said, \"only be more careful in future. And\nnow I wish you a good dinner, Chief Masapo, and peace upon your kraal,\nfriend Umbezi.\"\n\nAfter this speech I marched off, followed by the clamour of Masapo's\nfurious attendants and the sound of Mameena's light and mocking\nlaughter.\n\n\"I wonder which of them she will marry?\" I thought to myself, as I set\nout for the wagons.\n\nAs I approached my camp I saw that the oxen were being inspanned, as I\nsupposed by the order of Scowl, who must have heard that there was a row\nup at the kraal, and thought it well to be ready to bolt. In this I was\nmistaken, however, for just then Saduko strolled out of a patch of bush\nand said:\n\n\"I ordered your boys to yoke up the oxen, Inkoosi.\"\n\n\"Have you? That's cool!\" I answered. \"Perhaps you will tell me why.\"\n\n\"Because we must make a good trek to the northward before night,\nInkoosi.\"\n\n\"Indeed! I thought that I was heading south-east.\"\n\n\"Bangu does not live in the south or the east,\" he replied slowly.\n\n\"Oh, I had almost forgotten about Bangu,\" I said, with a rather feeble\nattempt at evasion.\n\n\"Is it so?\" he answered in his haughty voice. \"I never knew before that\nMacumazahn was a man who broke a promise to his friend.\"\n\n\"Would you be so kind as to explain your meaning, Saduko?\"\n\n\"Is it needful?\" he answered, shrugging his shoulders. \"Unless my ears\nplayed me tricks, you agreed to go up with me against Bangu. Well, I\nhave gathered the necessary men--with the king's leave--they await us\nyonder,\" and he pointed with his spear towards a dense patch of bush\nthat lay some miles beneath us. \"But,\" he added, \"if you desire to\nchange your mind I will go alone. Only then, I think, we had better bid\neach other good-bye, since I love not friends who change their minds\nwhen the assegais begin to shake.\"\n\nNow, whether Saduko spoke thus by design I do not know. Certainly,\nhowever, he could have found no better way to ensure my companionship\nfor what it was worth, since, although I had made no actual promise in\nthis case, I have always prided myself on keeping even a half-bargain\nwith a native.\n\n\"I will go with you,\" I said quietly, \"and I hope that, when it comes to\nthe pinch, your spear will be as sharp as your tongue, Saduko. Only do\nnot speak to me again like that, lest we should quarrel.\"\n\nAs I said this I saw a look of relief appear on his face, of very great\nrelief.\n\n\"I pray your pardon, my lord Macumazahn,\" he said, seizing my hand,\n\"but, oh! there is a hole in my heart. I think that Mameena means to\nplay me false, and now that has happened with yonder dog, Masapo, which\nwill make her father hate me.\"\n\n\"If you will take my advice, Saduko,\" I replied earnestly, \"you will\nlet this Mameena fall out of the hole in your heart; you will forget her\nname; you will have done with her. Ask me not why.\"\n\n\"Perhaps there is no need, O Macumazana. Perhaps she has been making\nlove to you, and you have turned her away, as, being what you are, and\nmy friend, of course you would do.\" (It is rather inconvenient to be\nset upon such a pedestal at times, but I did not attempt to assent or to\ndeny anything, much less to enter into explanations.)\n\n\"Perhaps all this has happened,\" he continued, \"or perhaps it is she who\nhas sent for Masapo the Hog. I do not ask, because if you know you will\nnot tell me. Moreover, it matters nothing. While I have a heart, Mameena\nwill never drop out of it; while I can remember names, hers will never\nbe forgotten by me. Moreover, I mean that she shall be my wife. Now, I\nam minded to take a few men and spear this hog, Masapo, before we go up\nagainst Bangu, for then he, at any rate, will be out of my road.\"\n\n\"If you do anything of the sort, Saduko, you will go up against Bangu\nalone, for I trek east at once, who will not be mixed up with murder.\"\n\n\"Then let it be, Inkoosi; unless he attacks me, as my Snake send that\nhe may, the Hog can wait. After all, he will only be growing a little\nfatter. Now, if it pleases you order the wagons to trek. I will show the\nroad, for we must camp in that bush to-night where my people wait\nme, and there I will tell you my plans; also you will find one with a\nmessage for you.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. THE AMBUSH\n\n\nWe had reached the bush after six hours' downhill trek over a pretty bad\ntrack made by cattle--of course, there were no roads in Zululand at this\ndate. I remember the place well. It was a kind of spreading woodland\non a flat bottom, where trees of no great size grew sparsely. Some were\nmimosa thorns, others had deep green leaves and bore a kind of plum with\nan acid taste and a huge stone, and others silver-coloured leaves in\ntheir season. A river, too, low at this time of the year, wound through\nit, and in the scrub upon its banks were many guinea-fowl and other\nbirds. It was a pleasing, lonely place, with lots of game in it, that\ncame here in the winter to eat the grass, which was lacking on the\nhigher veld. Also it gave the idea of vastness, since wherever one\nlooked there was nothing to be seen except a sea of trees.\n\nWell, we outspanned by the river, of which I forget the name, at a spot\nthat Saduko showed us, and set to work to cook our food, that consisted\nof venison from a blue wildebeest, one of a herd of these wild-looking\nanimals which I had been fortunate enough to shoot as they whisked past\nus, gambolling in and out between the trees.\n\nWhile we were eating I observed that armed Zulus arrived continually in\nparties of from six to a score of men, and as they arrived lifted their\nspears, though whether in salutation to Saduko or to myself I did\nnot know, and sat themselves down on an open space between us and the\nriver-bank. Although it was difficult to say whence they came, for\nthey appeared like ghosts out of the bush, I thought it well to take no\nnotice of them, since I guessed that their coming was prearranged.\n\n\"Who are they?\" I whispered to Scowl, as he brought me my tot of\n\"squareface.\"\n\n\"Saduko's wild men,\" he answered in the same low voice, \"outlaws of his\ntribe who live among the rocks.\"\n\nNow I scanned them sideways, while pretending to light my pipe and so\nforth, and certainly they seemed a remarkably savage set of people.\nGreat, gaunt fellows with tangled hair, who wore tattered skins upon\ntheir shoulders and seemed to have no possessions save some snuff, a few\nsleeping-mats, and an ample supply of large fighting shields, hardwood\nkerries or knob-sticks, and broad ixwas, or stabbing assegais. Such\nwas the look of them as they sat round us in silent semicircles, like\naas-v\u00f5gels--as the Dutch call vultures--sit round a dying ox.\n\nStill I smoked on and took no notice.\n\nAt length, as I expected, Saduko grew weary of my silence and spoke.\n\"These are men of the Amangwane tribe, Macumazahn; three hundred of\nthem, all that Bangu left alive, for when their fathers were killed,\nthe women escaped with some of the children, especially those of the\noutlying kraals. I have gathered them to be revenged upon Bangu, I who\nam their chief by right of blood.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" I answered. \"I see that you have gathered them; but do they\nwish to be revenged on Bangu at the risk of their own lives?\"\n\n\"We do, white Inkoosi,\" came the deep-throated answer from the three\nhundred.\n\n\"And do they acknowledge you, Saduko, to be their chief?\"\n\n\"We do,\" again came the answer. Then a spokesman stepped forward, one of\nthe few grey-haired men among them, for most of these Amangwane were of\nthe age of Saduko, or even younger.\n\n\"O Watcher-by-Night,\" he said, \"I am Tshoza, the brother of Matiwane,\nSaduko's father, the only one of his brothers that escaped the slaughter\non the night of the Great Killing. Is it not so?\"\n\n\"It is so,\" exclaimed the serried ranks behind him.\n\n\"I acknowledge Saduko as my chief, and so do we all,\" went on Tshoza.\n\n\"So do we all,\" echoed the ranks.\n\n\"Since Matiwane died we have lived as we could, O Macumazana; like\nbaboons among the rocks, without cattle, often without a hut to shelter\nus; here one, there one. Still, we have lived, awaiting the hour of\nvengeance upon Bangu, that hour which Zikali the Wise, who is of our\nblood, has promised to us. Now we believe that it has come, and one and\nall, from here, from there, from everywhere, we have gathered at the\nsummons of Saduko to be led against Bangu and to conquer him or to die.\nIs it not so, Amangwane?\"\n\n\"It is, it is so!\" came the deep, unanimous answer, that caused the\nstirless leaves to shake in the still air.\n\n\"I understand, O Tshoza, brother of Matiwane and uncle of Saduko the\nchief,\" I replied. \"But Bangu is a strong man, living, I am told, in a\nstrong place. Still, let that go; for have you not said that you come\nout to conquer or to die, you who have nothing to lose; and if you\nconquer, you conquer; and if you die, you die and the tale is told. But\nsupposing that you conquer. What will Panda, King of the Zulus, say to\nyou, and to me also, who stir up war in his country?\"\n\nNow the Amangwane looked behind them, and Saduko cried out:\n\n\"Appear, messenger from Panda the King!\"\n\nBefore his words had ceased to echo I saw a little, withered man\nthreading his way between the tall, gaunt forms of the Amangwane. He\ncame and stood before me, saying:\n\n\"Hail, Macumazahn. Do you remember me?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" I answered, \"I remember you as Maputa, one of Panda's indunas.\"\n\n\"Quite so, Macumazahn; I am Maputa, one of his indunas, a member of\nhis Council, a captain of his impis [that is, armies], as I was to his\nbrothers who are gone, whose names it is not lawful that I should name.\nWell, Panda the King has sent me to you, at the request of Saduko there,\nwith a message.\"\n\n\"How do I know that you are a true messenger?\" I asked. \"Have you\nbrought me any token?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" he answered, and, fumbling under his cloak, he produced something\nwrapped in dried leaves, which he undid and handed to me, saying:\n\n\"This is the token that Panda sends to you, Macumazahn, bidding me\nto tell you that you will certainly know it again; also that you are\nwelcome to it, since the two little bullets which he swallowed as you\ndirected made him very ill, and he needs no more of them.\"\n\nI took the token, and, examining it in the moonlight, recognised it at\nonce.\n\nIt was a cardboard box of strong calomel pills, on the top of which was\nwritten: \"Allan Quatermain, Esq.: One _only_ to be taken as directed.\"\nWithout entering into explanations, I may state that I had taken \"one as\ndirected,\" and subsequently presented the rest of the box to King Panda,\nwho was very anxious to \"taste the white man's medicine.\"\n\n\"Do you recognise the token, Macumazahn?\" asked the induna.\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied gravely; \"and let the King return thanks to the spirits\nof his ancestors that he did not swallow three of the balls, for if\nhe had done so, by now there would have been another Head in Zululand.\nWell, speak on, Messenger.\"\n\nBut to myself I reflected, not for the first time, how strangely these\nnatives could mix up the sublime with the ridiculous. Here was a matter\nthat must involve the death of many men, and the token sent to me by the\nautocrat who stood at the back of it all, to prove the good faith of his\nmessenger, was a box of calomel pills! However, it served the purpose as\nwell as anything else.\n\nMaputa and I drew aside, for I saw that he wished to speak with me\nalone.\n\n\"O Macumazana,\" he said, when we were out of hearing of the others,\n\"these are the words of Panda to you: 'I understand that you,\nMacumazahn, have promised to accompany Saduko, son of Matiwane, on an\nexpedition of his against Bangu, chief of the Amakoba. Now, were anyone\nelse concerned, I should forbid this expedition, and especially should I\nforbid you, a white man in my country, to share therein. But this dog of\na Bangu is an evil-doer. Many years ago he worked on the Black One who\nwent before me to send him to destroy Matiwane, my friend, filling\nthe Black One's ears with false accusations; and thereafter he did\ntreacherously destroy him and all his tribe save Saduko, his son, and\nsome of the people and children who escaped. Moreover, of late he has\nbeen working against me, the King, striving to stir up rebellion against\nme, because he knows that I hate him for his crimes. Now I, Panda,\nunlike those who went before me, am a man of peace who do not wish to\nlight the fire of civil war in the land, for who knows where such fires\nwill stop, or whose kraals they will consume? Yet I do wish to see Bangu\npunished for his wickedness, and his pride abated. Therefore I give\nSaduko leave, and those people of the Amangwane who remain to him,\nto avenge their private wrongs upon Bangu if they can; and I give you\nleave, Macumazahn, to be of his party. Moreover, if any cattle are\ntaken, I shall ask no account of them; you and Saduko may divide them as\nyou wish. But understand, O Macumazana, that if you or your people\nare killed or wounded, or robbed of your goods, I know nothing of the\nmatter, and am not responsible to you or to the white House of Natal; it\nis your own matter. These are my words. I have spoken.'\"\n\n\"I see,\" I answered. \"I am to pull Panda's hot iron out of the fire and\nto extinguish the fire. If I succeed I may keep a piece of the iron when\nit gets cool, and if I burn my fingers it is my own fault, and I or my\nHouse must not come crying to Panda.\"\n\n\"O Watcher-by-Night, you have speared the bull in the heart,\" replied\nMaputa, the messenger, nodding his shrewd old head. \"Well, will you go\nup with Saduko?\"\n\n\"Say to the King, O Messenger, that I will go up with Saduko because I\npromised him that I would, being moved by the tale of his wrongs, and\nnot for the sake of the cattle, although it is true that if I hear any\nof them lowing in my camp I may keep them. Say to Panda also that if\naught of ill befalls me he shall hear nothing of it, nor will I bring\nhis high name into this business; but that he, on his part, must not\nblame me for anything that may happen afterwards. Have you the message?\"\n\n\"I have it word for word; and may your Spirit be with you, Macumazahn,\nwhen you attack the strong mountain of Bangu, which, were I you,\" Maputa\nadded reflectively, \"I think I should do just at the dawn, since the\nAmakoba drink much beer and are heavy sleepers.\"\n\nThen we took a pinch of snuff together, and he departed at once for\nNodwengu, Panda's Great Place.\n\n\nFourteen days had gone by, and Saduko and I, with our ragged band of\nAmangwane, sat one morning, after a long night march, in the hilly\ncountry looking across a broad vale, which was sprinkled with trees like\nan English park, at that mountain on the side of which Bangu, chief of\nthe Amakoba, had his kraal.\n\nIt was a very formidable mountain, and, as we had already observed, the\npaths leading up to the kraal were amply protected with stone walls in\nwhich the openings were quite narrow, only just big enough to allow one\nox to pass through them at a time. Moreover, all these walls had been\nstrengthened recently, perhaps because Bangu was aware that Panda looked\nupon him, a northern chief dwelling on the confines of his dominions,\nwith suspicion and even active enmity, as he was also no doubt aware\nPanda had good cause to do.\n\nHere in a dense patch of bush that grew in a kloof of the hills we held\na council of war.\n\nSo far as we knew our advance had been unobserved, for I had left my\nwagons in the low veld thirty miles away, giving it out among the local\nnatives that I was hunting game there, and bringing on with me only\nScowl and four of my best hunters, all well-armed natives who could\nshoot. The three hundred Amangwane also had advanced in small parties,\nseparated from each other, pretending to be Kafirs marching towards\nDelagoa Bay. Now, however, we had all met in this bush. Among our number\nwere three Amangwane who, on the slaughter of their tribe, had fled with\ntheir mothers to this district and been brought up among the people of\nBangu, but who at his summons had come back to Saduko. It was on these\nmen that we relied at this juncture, for they alone knew the country.\nLong and anxiously did we consult with them. First they explained, and,\nso far as the moonlight would allow, for as yet the dawn had not broken,\npointed out to us the various paths that led to Bangu's kraal.\n\n\"How many men are there in the town?\" I asked.\n\n\"About seven hundred who carry spears,\" they answered, \"together with\nothers in outlying kraals. Moreover, watchmen are always set at the\ngateways in the walls.\"\n\n\"And where are the cattle?\" I asked again.\n\n\"Here, in the valley beneath, Macumazahn,\" answered the spokesman. \"If\nyou listen you will hear them lowing. Fifty men, not less, watch them at\nnight--two thousand head of them, or more.\"\n\n\"Then it would not be difficult to get round these cattle and drive them\noff, leaving Bangu to breed up a new herd?\"\n\n\"It might not be difficult,\" interrupted Saduko, \"but I came here to\nkill Bangu, as well as to seize his cattle, since with him I have a\nblood feud.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" I answered; \"but that mountain cannot be stormed with three\nhundred men, fortified as it is with walls and schanzes. Our band would\nbe destroyed before ever we came to the kraal, since, owing to the\nsentries who are set everywhere, it would be impossible to surprise the\nplace. Also you have forgotten the dogs, Saduko. Moreover, even if it\nwere possible, I will have nothing to do with the massacre of women and\nchildren, which must happen in an assault. Now, listen to me, O Saduko.\nI say let us leave the kraal of Bangu alone, and this coming night send\nfifty of our men, under the leadership of the guides, down to yonder\nbush, where they will lie hid. Then, after moonrise, when all are\nasleep, these fifty must rush the cattle kraal, killing any who may\noppose them, should they be seen, and driving the herd out through\nyonder great pass by which we have entered the land. Bangu and his\npeople, thinking that those who have taken the cattle are but common\nthieves of some wild tribe, will gather and follow the beasts to\nrecapture them. But we, with the rest of the Amangwane, can set an\nambush in the narrowest part of the pass among the rocks, where the\ngrass is high and the euphorbia trees grow thick, and there, when they\nhave passed the Nek, which I and my hunters will hold with our guns, we\nwill give them battle. What say you?\"\n\nNow, Saduko answered that he would rather attack the kraal, which he\nwished to burn. But the old Amangwane, Tshoza, brother of the dead\nMatiwane, said:\n\n\"No, Macumazahn, Watcher-by-Night, is wise. Why should we waste our\nstrength on stone walls, of which none know the number or can find the\ngates in the darkness, and thereby leave our skulls to be set up as\nornaments on the fences of the accursed Amakoba? Let us draw the Amakoba\nout into the pass of the mountains, where they have no walls to protect\nthem, and there fall on them when they are bewildered and settle\nthe matter with them man to man. As for the women and children, with\nMacumazahn I say let them go; afterwards, perhaps, they will become\n_our_ women and children.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" answered the Amangwane, \"the plan of the white Inkoosi is good;\nhe is clever as a weasel; we will have his plan and no other.\"\n\nSo Saduko was overruled and my counsel adopted.\n\nAll that day we rested, lighting no fires and remaining still as the\ndead in the dense bush. It was a very anxious day, for although the\nplace was so wild and lonely, there was always the fear lest we should\nbe discovered. It was true that we had travelled mostly by night in\nsmall parties, to avoid leaving a spoor, and avoided all kraals; still,\nsome rumour of our approach might have reached the Amakoba, or a party\nof hunters might stumble on us, or those who sought for lost cattle.\n\nIndeed, something of this sort did happen, for about midday we heard a\nfootfall, and perceived the figure of a man, whom by his head-dress we\nknew for an Amakoba, threading his way through the bush. Before he saw\nus he was in our midst. For a moment he hesitated ere he turned to fly,\nand that moment was his last, for three of the Amangwane leapt on him\nsilently as leopards leap upon a buck, and where he stood there he died.\nPoor fellow! Evidently he had been on a visit to some witch-doctor, for\nin his blanket we found medicine and love charms. This doctor cannot\nhave been one of the stamp of Zikali the Dwarf, I thought to myself;\nat least, he had not warned him that he would never live to dose his\nbeloved with that foolish medicine.\n\nMeanwhile a few of us who had the quickest eyes climbed trees, and\nthence watched the town of Bangu and the valley that lay between us and\nit. Soon we saw that so far, at any rate, Fortune was playing into our\nhands, since herd after herd of kine were driven into the valley during\nthe afternoon and enclosed in the stock-kraals. Doubtless Bangu intended\non the morrow to make his half-yearly inspection of all the cattle of\nthe tribe, many of which were herded at a distance from his town.\n\nAt length the long day drew to its close and the shadows of the evening\nthickened. Then we made ready for our dreadful game, of which the stake\nwas the lives of all of us, since, should we fail, we could expect no\nmercy. The fifty picked men were gathered and ate food in silence.\nThese men were placed under the command of Tshoza, for he was the most\nexperienced of the Amangwane, and led by the three guides who had dwelt\namong the Amakoba, and who \"knew every ant-heap in the land,\" or so\nthey swore. Their duty, it will be remembered, was to cross the valley,\nseparate themselves into small parties, unbar the various cattle kraals,\nkill or hunt off the herdsmen, and drive the beasts back across the\nvalley into the pass. A second fifty men, under the command of Saduko,\nwere to be left just at the end of this pass where it opened out into\nthe valley, in order to help and reinforce the cattle-lifters, or, if\nneed be, to check the following Amakoba while the great herds of beasts\nwere got away, and then fall back on the rest of us in our ambush nearly\ntwo miles distant. The management of this ambush was to be my charge--a\nheavy one indeed.\n\nNow, the moon would not be up till midnight. But two hours before that\ntime we began our moves, since the cattle must be driven out of the\nkraals as soon as she appeared and gave the needful light. Otherwise\nthe fight in the pass would in all probability be delayed till after\nsunrise, when the Amakoba would see how small was the number of their\nfoes. Terror, doubt, darkness--these must be our allies if our desperate\nventure was to succeed.\n\nAll was arranged at last and the time had come. We, the three captains\nof our divided force, bade each other farewell, and passed the word\ndown the ranks that, should we be separated by the accidents of war, my\nwagons were the meeting-place of any who survived.\n\nTshoza and his fifty glided away into the shadow silently as ghosts\nand were gone. Presently the fierce-faced Saduko departed also with\nhis fifty. He carried the double-barrelled gun I had given him, and\nwas accompanied by one of my best hunters, a Natal native, who was also\narmed with a heavy smooth-bore loaded with slugs. Our hope was that the\nsound of these guns might terrify the foe, should there be occasion to\nuse them before our forces joined up again, and make them think they\nhad to do with a body of raiding Dutch white men, of whose roers--as\nthe heavy elephant guns of that day were called--all natives were much\nafraid.\n\nSo Saduko went with his fifty, leaving me wondering whether I should\never see his face again. Then I, my bearer Scowl, the two remaining\nhunters, and the ten score Amangwane who were left turned and soon were\nfollowing the road by which we had come down the rugged pass. I call\nit a road, but, in fact, it was nothing but a water-washed gully strewn\nwith boulders, through which we must pick our way as best we could in\nthe darkness, having first removed the percussion cap from the nipple of\nevery gun, for fear lest the accidental discharge of one of them should\nwarn the Amakoba, confuse our other parties, and bring all our deep-laid\nplans to nothing.\n\nWell, we accomplished that march somehow, walking in three long lines,\nso that each man might keep touch with him in front, and just as the\nmoon began to rise reached the spot that I had chosen for the ambush.\n\nCertainly it was well suited to that purpose. Here the track or gully\nbed narrowed to a width of not more than a hundred feet, while the steep\nslopes of the kloof on either side were clothed with scattered bushes\nand finger-like euphorbias which grew among stones. Behind these stones\nand bushes we hid ourselves, a hundred men on one side and a hundred on\nthe other, whilst I and my three hunters, who were armed with guns, took\nup a position under shelter of a great boulder nearly five feet thick\nthat lay but a little to the right of the gully itself, up which we\nexpected the cattle would come. This place I chose for two reasons:\nfirst, that I might keep touch with both wings of my force, and,\nsecondly, that we might be able to fire straight down the path on the\npursuing Amakoba.\n\nThese were the orders that I gave to the Amangwane, warning them that he\nwho disobeyed would be punished with death. They were not to stir until\nI, or, if I should be killed, one of my hunters, fired a shot; for my\nfear was lest, growing excited, they might leap out before the time and\nkill some of our own people, who very likely would be mixed up with the\nfirst of the pursuing Amakoba. Secondly, when the cattle had passed and\nthe signal had been given, they were to rush on the Amakoba, throwing\nthemselves across the gully, so that the enemy would have to fight\nupwards on a steep slope.\n\nThat was all I told them, since it is not wise to confuse natives by\ngiving too many orders. One thing I added, however--that they must\nconquer or they must die. There was no mercy for them; it was a case\nof death or victory. Their spokesman--for these people always find\na spokesman--answered that they thanked me for my advice; that they\nunderstood, and that they would do their best. Then they lifted their\nspears to me in salute. A wild lot of men they looked in the moonlight\nas they departed to take shelter behind the rocks and trees and wait.\n\nThat waiting was long, and I confess that before the end it got upon\nmy nerves. I began to think of all sorts of things, such as whether\nI should live to see the sun rise again; also I reflected upon the\nlegitimacy of this remarkable enterprise. What right had I to involve\nmyself in a quarrel between these savages?\n\nWhy had I come here? To gain cattle as a trader? No, for I was not at\nall sure that I would take them if gained. Because Saduko had twitted me\nwith faithlessness to my words? Yes, to a certain extent; but that was\nby no means the whole reason. I had been moved by the recital of the\ncruel wrongs inflicted upon Saduko and his tribe by this Bangu, and\ntherefore had not been loath to associate myself with his attempted\nvengeance upon a wicked murderer. Well, that was sound enough so far\nas it went; but now a new consideration suggested itself to me. Those\nwrongs had been worked many years ago; probably most of the men who had\naided and abetted them by now were dead or very aged, and it was their\nsons upon whom the vengeance would be wreaked.\n\nWhat right had I to assist in visiting the sins of the fathers upon the\nsons? Frankly I could not say. The thing seemed to me to be a part of\nthe problem of life, neither less nor more. So I shrugged my shoulders\nsadly and consoled myself by reflecting that very likely the issue would\ngo against me, and that my own existence would pay the price of the\nventure and expound its moral. This consideration soothed my conscience\nsomewhat, for when a man backs his actions with the risk of his life,\nright or wrong, at any rate he plays no coward's part.\n\nThe time went by very slowly and nothing happened. The waning moon shone\nbrightly in a clear sky, and as there was no wind the silence seemed\npeculiarly intense. Save for the laugh of an occasional hyena and now\nand again for a sound which I took for the coughing of a distant lion,\nthere was no stir between sleeping earth and moonlit heaven in which\nlittle clouds floated beneath the pale stars.\n\nAt length I thought that I heard a noise, a kind of murmur far away. It\ngrew, it developed.\n\nIt sounded like a thousand sticks tapping upon something hard, very\nfaintly. It continued to grow, and I knew the sound for that of the\nbeating hoofs of animals galloping. Then there were isolated noises,\nvery faint and thin; they might be shouts; then something that I could\nnot mistake--shots fired at a distance. So the business was afoot; the\ncattle were moving, Saduko and my hunter were firing. There was nothing\nfor it but to wait.\n\nThe excitement was very fierce; it seemed to consume me, to eat into\nmy brain. The sound of the tapping upon the rocks grew louder until\nit merged into a kind of rumble, mixed with an echo as of that of very\ndistant thunder, which presently I knew to be not thunder, but the\nbellowing of a thousand frightened beasts.\n\nNearer and nearer came the galloping hoofs and the rumble of bellowings;\nnearer and nearer the shouts of men, affronting the stillness of the\nsolemn night. At length a single animal appeared, a koodoo buck that\nsomehow had got mixed up with the cattle. It went past us like a flash,\nand was followed a minute or so later by a bull that, being young and\nlight, had outrun its companions. That, too, went by, foam on its lips\nand its tongue hanging from its jaws.\n\nThen the herd appeared--a countless herd it seemed to me--plunging up\nthe incline--cows, heifers, calves, bulls, and oxen, all mixed together\nin one inextricable mass, and every one of them snorting, bellowing,\nor making some other kind of sound. The din was fearful, the sight\nbewildering, for the beasts were of all colours, and their long horns\nflashed like ivory in the moonlight. Indeed, the only thing in the least\nlike it which I have ever seen was the rush of the buffaloes from the\nreed camp on that day when I got my injury.\n\nThey were streaming past us now, a mighty and moving mass so closely\npacked that a man might have walked upon their backs. In fact, some of\nthe calves which had been thrust up by the pressure were being carried\nalong in this fashion. Glad was I that none of us were in their path,\nfor their advance seemed irresistible. No fence or wall could have saved\nus, and even stout trees that grew in the gully were snapped or thrust\nover.\n\nAt length the long line began to thin, for now it was composed of\nstragglers and weak or injured beasts, of which there were many. Other\nsounds, too, began to dominate the bellowings of the animals, those\nof the excited cries of men. The first of our companions, the\ncattle-lifters, appeared, weary and gasping, but waving their spears in\ntriumph. Among them was old Tshoza. I stepped upon my rock, calling to\nhim by name. He heard me, and presently was lying at my side panting.\n\n\"We have got them all!\" he gasped. \"Not a hoof is left save those\nthat are trodden down. Saduko is not far behind with the rest of our\nbrothers, except some that have been killed. All the Amakoba tribe are\nafter us. He holds them back to give the cattle time to get away.\"\n\n\"Well done!\" I answered. \"It is very good. Now make your men hide among\nthe others that they may find their breath before the fight.\"\n\nSo he stopped them as they came. Scarcely had the last of them vanished\ninto the bushes when the gathering volume of shouts, amongst which I\nheard a gun go off, told us that Saduko and his band and the pursuing\nAmakoba were not far away. Presently they, too, appeared--that is the\nhandful of Amangwane did--not fighting now, but running as hard as they\ncould, for they knew they were approaching the ambush and wished to pass\nit so as not to be mixed up with the Amakoba. We let them go through us.\nAmong the last of them came Saduko, who was wounded, for the blood ran\ndown his side, supporting my hunter, who was also wounded, more severely\nas I feared.\n\nI called to him.\n\n\"Saduko,\" I said, \"halt at the crest of the path and rest there so that\nyou may be able to help us presently.\"\n\nHe waved the gun in answer, for he was too breathless to speak, and\nwent on with those who were left of his following--perhaps thirty men in\nall--in the track of the cattle. Before he was out of sight the\nAmakoba arrived, a mob of five or six hundred men mixed up together\nand advancing without order or discipline, for they seemed to have lost\ntheir heads as well as their cattle. Some of them had shields and some\nhad none, some broad and some throwing assegais, while many were quite\nnaked, not having stayed to put on their moochas and much less their war\nfinery. Evidently they were mad with rage, for the sounds that issued\nfrom them seemed to concentrate into one mighty curse.\n\nThe moment had come, though to tell the truth I heartily wished that\nit had not. I wasn't exactly afraid, although I never set up for great\ncourage, but I did not quite like the business. After all we were\nstealing these people's cattle, and now were going to kill as many\nof them as we could. I had to recall Saduko's dreadful story of the\nmassacre of his tribe before I could make up my mind to give the\nsignal. That hardened me, and so did the reflection that after all they\noutnumbered us enormously and very likely would prove victors in the\nend. Anyhow it was too late to repent. What a tricky and uncomfortable\nthing is conscience, that nearly always begins to trouble us at the\nmoment of, or after, the event, not before, when it might be of some\nuse.\n\nI raised myself upon the rock and fired both barrels of my gun into the\nadvancing horde, though whether I killed anyone or no I cannot say. I\nhave always hoped that I did not; but as the mark was large and I am a\nfair shot, I fear that is scarcely possible. Next moment, with a howl\nthat sounded like that of wild beasts, from either side of the gorge the\nfierce Amangwane free-spears--for that is what they were--leapt out of\ntheir hiding-places and hurled themselves upon their hereditary foes.\nThey were fighting for more than cattle; they were fighting for hate and\nfor revenge since these Amakoba had slaughtered their fathers and their\nmothers, their sisters and their brothers, and they alone remained to\npay them back blood for blood.\n\nGreat heaven! how they did fight, more like devils than human beings.\nAfter that first howl which shaped itself to the word \"Saduko,\" they\nwere silent as bulldogs. Though they were so few, at first their\nterrible rush drove back the Amakoba. Then, as these recovered from\ntheir surprise, the weight of numbers began to tell, for they, too, were\nbrave men who did not give way to panic. Scores of them went down at\nonce, but the remainder pushed the Amangwane before them up the hill. I\ntook little share in the fight, but was thrust backward with the others,\nonly firing when I was obliged to save my own life. Foot by foot we were\npushed back till at length we drew near to the crest of the pass.\n\nThen, while the issue hung in the balance, there was another shout of\n\"Saduko!\" and that chief himself, followed by his thirty, rushed upon\nthe Amakoba.\n\nThis charge decided the battle, for not knowing how many more were\ncoming, those who were left of the Amakoba turned and fled, nor did we\npursue them far.\n\nWe mustered on the hill-top, not more than two hundred of us now, the\nrest were fallen or desperately wounded, my poor hunter, whom I had lent\nto Saduko, being among the dead. Although wounded, he died fighting to\nthe last, then fell down, shouting to me:\n\n\"Chief, have I done well?\" and expired.\n\nI was breathless and spent, but as in a dream I saw some Amangwane drag\nup a gaunt old savage, crying:\n\n\"Here is Bangu, Bangu the Butcher, whom we have caught alive.\"\n\nSaduko stepped up to him.\n\n\"Ah! Bangu,\" he said, \"now say, why should I not kill you as you would\nhave killed the little lad Saduko long ago, had not Zikali saved him?\nSee, here is the mark of your spear.\"\n\n\"Kill,\" said Bangu. \"Your Spirit is stronger than mine. Did not Zikali\nforetell it? Kill, Saduko.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" answered Saduko. \"If you are weary I am weary, too, and wounded\nas well. Take a spear, Bangu, and we will fight.\"\n\nSo they fought there in the moonlight, man to man; fought fiercely while\nall watched, till presently I saw Bangu throw his arms wide and fall\nbackwards.\n\n\nSaduko was avenged. I have always been glad that he slew his enemy thus,\nand not as it might have been expected that he would do.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. SADUKO BRINGS THE MARRIAGE GIFT\n\n\nWe reached my wagons in the early morning of the following day, bringing\nwith us the cattle and our wounded. Thus encumbered it was a most\ntoilsome march, and an anxious one also, for it was always possible that\nthe remnant of the Amakoba might attempt pursuit. This, however, they\ndid not do, for very many of them were dead or wounded, and those who\nremained had no heart left in them. They went back to their mountain\nhome and lived there in shame and wretchedness, for I do not believe\nthere were fifty head of cattle left among the tribe, and Kafirs without\ncattle are nothing. Still, they did not starve, since there were plenty\nof women to work the fields, and we had not touched their corn. The\nend of them was that Panda gave them to their conqueror, Saduko, and he\nincorporated them with the Amangwane. But that did not happen until some\ntime afterwards.\n\nWhen we had rested a while at the wagons the captured beasts were\nmustered, and on being counted were found to number a little over twelve\nhundred head, not reckoning animals that had been badly hurt in the\nflight, which we killed for beef. It was a noble prize, truly, and,\nnotwithstanding the wound in his thigh, which hurt him a good deal now\nthat it had stiffened, Saduko stood up and surveyed them with glistening\neyes. No wonder, for he who had been so poor was now rich, and would\nremain so even after he had paid over whatever number of cows Umbezi\nchose to demand as the price of Mameena's hand. Moreover, he was sure,\nand I shared his confidence, that in these changed circumstances both\nthat young woman and her father would look upon his suit with very\nfavourable eyes. He had, so to speak, succeeded to the title and the\nfamily estates by means of a lawsuit brought in the \"Court of the\nAssegai,\" and therefore there was hardly a father in Zululand who would\nshut his kraal gate upon him. We forgot, both of us, the proverb that\npoints out how numerous are the slips between the cup and the lip,\nwhich, by the way, is one that has its Zulu equivalents. One of them, if\nI remember right at the moment, is: \"However loud the hen cackles, the\nhousewife does not always get the egg.\"\n\nAs it chanced, although Saduko's hen was cackling very loudly just at\nthis time, he was not destined to find the coveted egg. But of that\nmatter I will speak in its place.\n\nI, too, looked at those cattle, wondering whether Saduko would remember\nour bargain, under which some six hundred head of them belonged to me.\nSix hundred head! Why, putting them at \u00a35 apiece all round--and as oxen\nwere very scarce just at that time, they were worth quite as much, if\nnot more--that meant \u00a33,000, a larger sum of money than I had ever owned\nat one time in all my life. Truly the paths of violence were profitable!\nBut would he remember? On the whole I thought probably not, since Kafirs\nare not fond of parting with cattle.\n\nWell, I did him an injustice, for presently he turned and said, with\nsomething of an effort:\n\n\"Macumazahn, half of all these belong to you, and truly you have earned\nthem, for it was your cunning and good counsel that gained us the\nvictory. Now we will choose them beast by beast.\"\n\nSo I chose a fine ox, then Saduko chose one; and so it went on till I\nhad eight of my number driven out. As the eighth was taken I turned to\nSaduko and said:\n\n\"There, that will do. These oxen I must have to replace those in my\nteams which died on the trek, but I want no more.\"\n\n\"Wow!\" said Saduko, and all those who stood with him, while one of them\nadded--I think it was old Tshoza:\n\n\"He refuses six hundred cattle which are fairly his! He must be mad!\"\n\n\"No friends,\" I answered, \"I am not mad, but neither am I bad. I\naccompanied Saduko on this raid because he is dear to me and stood by\nme once in the hour of danger. But I do not love killing men with whom I\nhave no quarrel, and I will not take the price of blood.\"\n\n\"Wow!\" said old Tshoza again, for Saduko seemed too astonished to speak,\n\"he is a spirit, not a man. He is _holy!_\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it,\" I answered. \"If you think that, ask Mameena\"--a dark\nsaying which they did not understand. \"Now, listen. I will not take\nthose cattle because I do not think as you Kafirs think. But as they are\nmine, according to your law, I am going to dispose of them. I give ten\nhead to each of my hunters, and fifteen head to the relations of him\nwho was killed. The rest I give to Tshoza and to the other men of\nthe Amangwane who fought with us, to be divided among them in such\nproportions as they may agree, I being the judge in the event of any\nquarrel arising.\"\n\nNow these men raised a great cry of \"Inkoosi!\" and, running up, old\nTshoza seized my hand and kissed it.\n\n\"Your heart is big,\" he cried; \"you drop fatness! Although you are\nso small, the spirit of a king lives in you, and the wisdom of the\nheavens.\"\n\nThus he praised me, while all the others joined in, till the din was\nawful. Saduko thanked me also in his magnificent manner. Yet I do not\nthink that he was altogether pleased, although my great gift relieved\nhim from the necessity of sharing up the spoil with his companions.\nThe truth was, or so I believe, that he understood that henceforth the\nAmangwane would love me better than they loved him. This, indeed, proved\nto be the case, for I am sure that there was no man among all those wild\nfellows who would not have served me to the death, and to this day my\nname is a power among them and their descendants. Also it has grown into\nsomething of a proverb among all those Kafirs who know the story.\nThey talk of any great act of liberality in an idiom as \"a gift of\nMacumazana,\" and in the same way of one who makes any remarkable\nrenunciation, as \"a wearer of Macumazana's blanket,\" or as \"he who has\nstolen Macumazana's shadow.\"\n\nThus did I earn a great reputation very cheaply, for really I could not\nhave taken those cattle; also I am sure that had I done so they would\nhave brought me bad luck. Indeed, one of the regrets of my life is that\nI had anything whatsoever to do with the business.\n\n\nOur journey back to Umbezi's kraal--for thither we were heading--was\nvery slow, hampered as we were with wounded and by a vast herd of\ncattle. Of the latter, indeed, we got rid after a while, for, except\nthose which I had given to my men, and a hundred or so of the best\nbeasts that Saduko took with him for a certain purpose, they were sent\naway to a place which he had chosen, in charge of about half of his\npeople, under the command of his uncle, Tshoza, there to await his\ncoming.\n\nOver a month had gone by since the night of the ambush when at last we\noutspanned quite close to Umbezi's, in that bush where first I had met\nthe Amangwane free-spears. A very different set of men they looked on\nthis triumphant day to those fierce fellows who had slipped out of the\ntrees at the call of their chief. As we went through the country Saduko\nhad bought fine moochas and blankets for them; also head-dresses had\nbeen made with the long black feathers of the sakabuli finch, and\nshields and leglets of the hides and tails of oxen. Moreover, having fed\nplentifully and travelled easily, they were fat and well-favoured, as,\ngiven good food, natives soon become after a period of abstinence.\n\nThe plan of Saduko was to lie quiet in the bush that night, and on the\nfollowing morning to advance in all his grandeur, accompanied by his\nspears, present the hundred head of cattle that had been demanded, and\nformally ask his daughter's hand from Umbezi. As the reader may have\ngathered already, there was a certain histrionic vein in Saduko; also\nwhen he was in feather he liked to show off his plumage.\n\nWell, this plan was carried out to the letter. On the following morning,\nafter the sun was well up, Saduko, as a great chief does, sent forward\ntwo bedizened heralds to announce his approach to Umbezi, after whom\nfollowed two other men to sing his deeds and praises. (By the way, I\nobserved that they had clearly been instructed to avoid any mention of a\nperson called Macumazahn.) Then we advanced in force. First went Saduko,\nsplendidly apparelled as a chief, carrying a small assegai and adorned\nwith plumes, leglets and a leopard-skin kilt. He was attended by\nabout half a dozen of the best-looking of his followers, who posed as\n\"indunas\" or councillors. Behind these I walked, a dusty, insignificant\nlittle fellow, attended by the ugly, snub-nosed Scowl in a very greasy\npair of trousers, worn-out European boots through which his toes peeped,\nand nothing else, and by my three surviving hunters, whose appearance\nwas even more disreputable. After us marched about four score of the\ntransformed Amangwane, and after them came the hundred picked cattle\ndriven by a few herdsmen.\n\nIn due course we arrived at the gate of the kraal, where we found the\nheralds and the praisers prancing and shouting.\n\n\"Have you seen Umbezi?\" asked Saduko of them.\n\n\"No,\" they answered; \"he was asleep when we got here, but his people say\nthat he is coming out presently.\"\n\n\"Then tell his people that he had better be quick about it, or I shall\nturn him out,\" replied the proud Saduko.\n\nJust at this moment the kraal gate opened and through it appeared\nUmbezi, looking extremely fat and foolish; also, it struck me,\nfrightened, although this he tried to conceal.\n\n\"Who visits me here,\" he said, \"with so much--um--ceremony?\" and with\nthe carved dancing-stick he carried he pointed doubtfully at the lines\nof armed men. \"Oh, it is you, is it, Saduko?\" and he looked him up\nand down, adding: \"How grand you are to be sure. Have you been robbing\nanybody? And you, too, Macumazahn. Well, _you_ do not look grand. You\nlook like an old cow that has been suckling two calves on the winter\nveld. But tell me, what are all these warriors for? I ask because I have\nnot food for so many, especially as we have just had a feast here.\"\n\n\"Fear nothing, Umbezi,\" answered Saduko in his grandest manner. \"I have\nbrought food for my own men. As for my business, it is simple. You asked\na hundred head of cattle as the lobola [that is, the marriage gift] of\nyour daughter, Mameena. They are there. Go send your servants to the\nkraal and count them.\"\n\n\"Oh, with pleasure,\" Umbezi replied nervously, and he gave some orders\nto certain men behind him. \"I am glad to see that you have become rich\nin this sudden fashion, Saduko, though how you have done so I cannot\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"Never mind how I have become rich,\" answered Saduko. \"I _am_ rich; that\nis enough for the present. Be pleased to send for Mameena, for I would\ntalk with her.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, Saduko, I understand that you would talk with Mameena;\nbut\"--and he looked round him desperately--\"I fear that she is still\nasleep. As you know, Mameena was always a late riser, and, what is more,\nshe hates to be disturbed. Don't you think that you could come back,\nsay, to-morrow morning? She will be sure to be up by then; or, better\nstill, the day after?\"\n\n\"In which hut is Mameena?\" asked Saduko sternly, while I, smelling a\nrat, began to chuckle to myself.\n\n\"I really do not know, Saduko,\" replied Umbezi. \"Sometimes she sleeps in\none, sometimes in another, and sometimes she goes several hours' journey\naway to her aunt's kraal for a change. I should not be in the least\nsurprised if she had done so last night. I have no control over\nMameena.\"\n\nBefore Saduko could answer, a shrill, rasping voice broke upon our ears,\nwhich after some search I saw proceeded from an ugly and ancient female\nseated in the shadow, in whom I recognised the lady who was known by the\npleasing name of \"Worn-out-Old-Cow.\"\n\n\"He lies!\" screeched the voice. \"He lies. Thanks be to the spirit of my\nancestors that wild cat Mameena has left this kraal for good. She slept\nlast night, not with her aunt, but with her husband, Masapo, to whom\nUmbezi gave her in marriage two days ago, receiving in payment a\nhundred and twenty head of cattle, which was twenty more than _you_ bid,\nSaduko.\"\n\nNow when Saduko heard these words I thought that he would really go\nmad with rage. He turned quite grey under his dark skin and for a while\ntrembled like a leaf, looking as though he were about to fall to the\nground. Then he leapt as a lion leaps, and seizing Umbezi by the throat,\nhurled him backwards, standing over him with raised spear.\n\n\"You dog!\" he cried in a terrible voice. \"Tell me the truth or I will\nrip you up. What have you done with Mameena?\"\n\n\"Oh! Saduko,\" answered Umbezi in choking tones, \"Mameena has chosen to\nget married. It was no fault of mine; she would have her way.\"\n\nHe got no farther, and had I not intervened by throwing my arms about\nSaduko and dragging him back, that moment would have been Umbezi's\nlast, for Saduko was about to pin him to the earth with his spear. As it\nproved, I was just in time, and Saduko, being weak with emotion, for I\nfelt his heart going like a sledge-hammer, could not break from my grasp\nbefore his reason returned to him.\n\nAt length he recovered himself a little and threw down his spear as\nthough to put himself out of temptation. Then he spoke, always in the\nsame terrible voice, asking:\n\n\"Have you more to say about this business, Umbezi? I would hear all\nbefore I answer you.\"\n\n\"Only this, Saduko,\" replied Umbezi, who had risen to his feet and was\nshaking like a reed. \"I did no more than any other father would have\ndone. Masapo is a very powerful chief, one who will be a good stick for\nme to lean on in my old age. Mameena declared that she wished to marry\nhim--\"\n\n\"He lies!\" screeched the \"Old Cow.\" \"What Mameena said was that she had\nno will towards marriage with any Zulu in the land, so I suppose she is\nlooking after a white man,\" and she leered in my direction. \"She said,\nhowever, that if her father wished to marry her to Masapo, she must be\na dutiful daughter and obey him, but that if blood and trouble came of\nthat marriage, let it be on his head and not on hers.\"\n\n\"Would you also stick your claws into me, cat?\" shouted Umbezi, catching\nthe old woman a savage cut across the back with the light dancing-stick\nwhich he still held in his hand, whereon she fled away screeching and\ncursing him.\n\n\"Oh, Saduko,\" he went on, \"let not your ears be poisoned by these\nfalsehoods. Mameena never said anything of the sort, or if she did it\nwas not to me. Well, the moment that my daughter had consented to take\nMasapo as her husband his people drove a hundred and twenty of the most\nbeautiful cattle over the hill, and would you have had me refuse them,\nSaduko? I am sure that when you have seen them you will say that I\nwas quite right to accept such a splendid lobola in return for one\nsharp-tongued girl. Remember, Saduko, that although you had promised a\nhundred head, that is less by twenty, at the time you did not own one,\nand where you were to get them from I could not guess. Moreover,\" he\nadded with a last, desperate, imaginative effort, for I think he saw\nthat his arguments were making no impression, \"some strangers who called\nhere told me that both you and Macumazahn had been killed by certain\nevil-doers in the mountains. There, I have spoken, and, Saduko, if you\nnow have cattle, why, on my part, I have another daughter, not quite so\ngood-looking perhaps, but a much better worker in the field. Come and\ndrink a sup of beer, and I will send for her.\"\n\n\"Stop talking about your other daughter and your beer and listen to me,\"\nreplied Saduko, looking at the assegai which he had thrown to the ground\nso ominously that I set my foot on it. \"I am now a greater chief\nthan the boar Masapo. Has Masapo such a bodyguard as these\nEaters-up-of-Enemies?\" and he jerked his thumb backwards towards the\nserried lines of fierce-faced Amangwane who stood listening behind us.\n\"Has Masapo as many cattle as I have, whereof those which you see are\nbut a tithe brought as a lobola gift to the father of her who had been\npromised to me as wife? Is Masapo Panda's friend? I think that I have\nheard otherwise. Has Masapo just conquered a countless tribe by his\ncourage and his wit? Is Masapo young and of high blood, or is he but an\nold, low-born boar of the mountains?\n\n\"You do not answer, Umbezi, and perhaps you do well to be silent. Now\nlisten again. Were it not for Macumazahn here, whom I do not desire to\nmix up with my quarrels, I would bid my men take you and beat you to\ndeath with the handles of their spears, and then go on and serve the\nBoar in the same fashion in his mountain sty. As it is, these things\nmust wait a little while, especially as I have other matters to attend\nto first. Yet the day is not far off when I will attend to them also.\nTherefore my counsel to you, Cheat, is to make haste to die or to find\ncourage to fall upon a spear, unless you would learn how it feels to be\nbrayed with sticks like a green hide until none can know that you\nwere once a man. Send now and tell my words to Masapo the Boar. And to\nMameena say that soon I will come to take her with spears and not with\ncattle. Do you understand? Oh! I see that you do, since already you weep\nwith fear like a woman. Then farewell to you till that day when I\nreturn with the sticks, O Umbezi the cheat and the liar, Umbezi,\n'Eater-up-of-Elephants,'\" and turning, Saduko stalked away.\n\nI was about to follow in a great hurry, having had enough of this very\nunpleasant scene, when poor old Umbezi sprang at me and clasped me by\nthe arm.\n\n\"O Macumazana,\" he exclaimed, weeping in his terror, \"O Macumazana,\nif ever I have been a friend to you, help me out of this deep pit into\nwhich I have fallen through the tricks of that monkey of a daughter of\nmine, who I think is a witch born to bring trouble upon men. Macumazahn,\nif she had been your daughter and a powerful chief had appeared with a\nhundred and twenty head of such beautiful cattle, you would have given\nher to him, would you not, although he is of mixed blood and not very\nyoung, especially as she did not mind who only cares for place and\nwealth?\"\n\n\"I think not,\" I answered; \"but then it is not our custom to sell women\nin that fashion.\"\n\n\"No, no, I forgot; in this as in other matters you white men are mad\nand, Macumazahn, to tell you the truth, I believe it is you she really\ncares for; she said as much to me once or twice. Well, why did you not\ntake her away when I was not looking? We could have settled matters\nafterwards, and I should have been free of her witcheries and not up to\nmy neck in this hole as I am now.\"\n\n\"Because some people don't do that kind of thing, Umbezi.\"\n\n\"No, no, I forgot. Oh! why can I not remember that you are _quite_ mad\nand therefore that it must not be expected of you to act as though you\nwere sane. Well, at least you are that tiger Saduko's friend, which\nagain shows that you must be very mad, for most people would sooner try\nto milk a cow buffalo than walk hand in hand with him. Don't you see,\nMacumazahn, that he means to kill me, Macumazahn, to bray me like a\ngreen hide? Ugh! to beat me to death with sticks. Ugh! And what is more,\nthat unless you prevent him, he will certainly do it, perhaps to-morrow\nor the next day. Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!\"\n\n\"Yes, I see, Umbezi, and I think that he _will_ do it. But what I do not\nsee is how I am to prevent him. Remember that you let Mameena grow into\nhis heart and behaved badly to him, Umbezi.\"\n\n\"I never promised her to him, Macumazahn. I only said that if he brought\na hundred cattle, then I might promise.\"\n\n\"Well, he has wiped out the Amakoba, the enemies of his House, and there\nare the hundred cattle whereof he has many more, and now it is too late\nfor you to keep your share of the bargain. So I think you must make\nyourself as comfortable as you can in the hole that your hands dug,\nUmbezi, which I would not share for all the cattle in Zululand.\"\n\n\"Truly you are not one from whom to seek comfort in the hour of\ndistress,\" groaned poor Umbezi, then added, brightening up: \"But perhaps\nPanda will kill him because he has wiped out Bangu in a time of peace.\nOh Macumazahn, can you not persuade Panda to kill him? If so, I now have\nmore cattle than I really want--\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" I answered. \"Panda is his friend, and between ourselves I\nmay tell you that he ate up the Amakoba by his especial wish. When the\nKing hears of it he will call to Saduko to sit in his shadow and make\nhim great, one of his councillors, probably with power of life and death\nover little people like you and Masapo.\"\n\n\"Then it is finished,\" said Umbezi faintly, \"and I will try to die\nlike a man. But to be brayed like a hide! And with thin sticks! Oh!\" he\nadded, grinding his teeth, \"if only I can get hold of Mameena I will\nnot leave much of that pretty hair of hers upon her head. I will tie her\nhands and shut her up with the 'Old Cow,' who loves her as a meer-cat\nloves a mouse. No; I will kill her. There--do you hear, Macumazahn,\nunless you do something to help me, I will kill Mameena, and you won't\nlike that, for I am sure she is dear to you, although you were not man\nenough to run away with her as she wished.\"\n\n\"If you touch Mameena,\" I said, \"be certain, my friend, that Saduko's\nsticks and your skin will not be far apart, for I will report you to\nPanda myself as an unnatural evil-doer. Now hearken to me, you old fool.\nSaduko is so fond of your daughter, on this point being mad, as you say\nI am, that if only he could get her I think he might overlook the fact\nof her having been married before. What you have to do is to try to\nbuy her back from Masapo. Mind you, I say buy her back--not get her\nby bloodshed--which you might do by persuading Masapo to put her away.\nThen, if he knew that you were trying to do this, I think that Saduko\nmight leave his sticks uncut for a while.\"\n\n\"I will try. I will indeed, Macumazahn. I will try very hard. It is true\nMasapo is an obstinate pig; still, if he knows that his own life is\nat stake, he might give way. Moreover, when she learns that Saduko\nhas grown rich and great, Mameena might help me. Oh, I thank you,\nMacumazahn; you are indeed the prop of my hut, and it and all in it are\nyours. Farewell, farewell, Macumazahn, if you must go. But why--why did\nyou not run away with Mameena, and save me all this fear and trouble?\"\n\n\nSo I and that old humbug, Umbezi, \"Eater-up-of-Elephants,\" parted for\na while, and never did I know him in a more chastened frame of mind,\nexcept once, as I shall tell.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. THE KING'S DAUGHTER\n\n\nWhen I got back to my wagons after this semi-tragical interview with\nthat bombastic and self-seeking old windbag, Umbezi, it was to find\nthat Saduko and his warriors had already marched for the King's kraal,\nNodwengu. A message awaited me, however, to the effect that it was\nhoped that I would follow, in order to make report of the affair of the\ndestruction of the Amakoba. This, after reflection, I determined to\ndo, really, I think, because of the intense human interest of the whole\nbusiness. I wanted to see how it would work out.\n\nAlso, in a way, I read Saduko's mind and understood that at the moment\nhe did not wish to discuss the matter of his hideous disappointment.\nWhatever else may have been false in this man's nature, one thing\nrang true, namely, his love or his infatuation for the girl Mameena.\nThroughout his life she was his guiding star--about as evil a star as\ncould have arisen upon any man's horizon; the fatal star that was to\nlight him down to doom. Let me thank Providence, as I do, that I was\nso fortunate as to escape its baneful influences, although I admit that\nthey attracted me not a little.\n\nSo, seduced thither by my curiosity, which has so often led me into\ntrouble, I trekked to Nodwengu, full of many doubts not unmingled with\namusement, for I could not rid my mind of recollections of the utter\nterror of the \"Eater-up-of-Elephants\" when he was brought face to face\nwith the dreadful and concentrated rage of the robbed Saduko and the\npromise of his vengeance. Ultimately I arrived at the Great Place\nwithout experiencing any adventure that is worthy of record, and camped\nin a spot that was appointed to me by some _induna_ whose name I forget,\nbut who evidently knew of my approach, for I found him awaiting me at\nsome distance from the town. Here I sat for quite a long while, two or\nthree days, if I remember right, amusing myself with killing or missing\nturtle-doves with a shotgun, and similar pastimes, until something\nshould happen, or I grew tired and started for Natal.\n\nIn the end, just as I was about to trek seawards, an old friend, Maputa,\nturned up at my wagons--that same man who had brought me the message\nfrom Panda before we started to attack Bangu.\n\n\"Greeting, Macumazahn,\" he said. \"What of the Amakoba? I see they did\nnot kill you.\"\n\n\"No,\" I answered, handing him some snuff, \"they did not quite kill me,\nfor here I am. What is your pleasure with me?\"\n\n\"O Macumazana, only that the King wishes to know whether you have any of\nthose little balls left in the box which I brought back to you, since,\nif so, he thinks he would like to swallow one of them in this hot\nweather.\"\n\nI proffered him the whole box, but he would not take it, saying that the\nKing would like me to give it to him myself. Now I understood that this\nwas a summons to an audience, and asked when it would please Panda\nto receive me and \"the-little-black-stones-that-work-wonders.\" He\nanswered--at once.\n\nSo we started, and within an hour I stood, or rather sat, before Panda.\n\nLike all his family, the King was an enormous man, but, unlike Chaka and\nthose of his brothers whom I had known, one of a kindly countenance.\nI saluted him by lifting my cap, and took my place upon a wooden stool\nthat had been provided for me outside the great hut, in the shadow of\nwhich he sat within his isi-gohlo, or private enclosure.\n\n\"Greeting, O Macumazana,\" he said. \"I am glad to see you safe and well,\nfor I understand that you have been engaged upon a perilous adventure\nsince last we met.\"\n\n\"Yes, King,\" I answered; \"but to which adventure do you refer--that\nof the buffalo, when Saduko helped me, or that of the Amakoba, when I\nhelped Saduko?\"\n\n\"The latter, Macumazahn, of which I desire to hear all the story.\"\n\nSo I told it to him, he and I being alone, for he commanded his\ncouncillors and servants to retire out of hearing.\n\n\"Wow!\" he said, when I had finished, \"you are clever as a baboon,\nMacumazahn. That was a fine trick to set a trap for Bangu and his\nAmakoba dogs and bait it with his own cattle. But they tell me that you\nrefused your share of those cattle. Now, why was that, Macumazahn?\"\n\nBy way of answer I repeated to Panda my reasons, which I have set out\nalready.\n\n\"Ah!\" he exclaimed, when I had finished. \"Every one seeks greatness in\nhis own way, and perhaps yours is better than ours. Well, the White man\nwalks one road--or some of them do--and the Black man another. They both\nend at the same place, and none will know which is the right road till\nthe journey is done. Meanwhile, what you lose Saduko and his people\ngain. He is a wise man, Saduko, who knows how to choose his friends, and\nhis wisdom has brought him victory and gifts. But to you, Macumazahn, it\nhas brought nothing but honour, on which, if a man feeds only, he will\ngrow thin.\"\n\n\"I like to be thin, O Panda,\" I answered slowly.\n\n\"Yes, yes, I understand,\" replied the King, who, in common with most\nnatives, was quick enough to seize a point, \"and I, too, like people who\nkeep thin on such food as yours, people, also, whose hands are always\nclean. We Zulus trust you, Macumazahn, as we trust few white men, for we\nhave known for years that your lips say what your heart thinks, and\nthat your heart always thinks the thing which is good. You may be named\nWatcher-by-Night, but you love light, not darkness.\"\n\nNow, at these somewhat unusual compliments I bowed, and felt myself\ncolouring a little as I did so, even through my sunburn, but I made no\nanswer to them, since to do so would have involved a discussion of the\npast and its tragical events, into which I had no wish to enter. Panda,\ntoo, remained silent for a while. Then he called to a messenger to\nsummon the princes, Cetewayo and Umbelazi, and to bid Saduko, the son of\nMatiwane, to wait without, in case he should wish to speak with him.\n\nA few minutes later the two princes arrived. I watched their coming with\ninterest, for they were the most important men in Zululand, and already\nthe nation debated fiercely which of them would succeed to the throne. I\nwill try to describe them a little.\n\nThey were both of much the same age--it is always difficult to arrive\nat a Zulu's exact years--and both fine young men. Cetewayo, however, had\nthe stronger countenance. It was said that he resembled that fierce and\nable monster, Chaka the Wild Beast, his uncle, and certainly I perceived\nin him a likeness to his other uncle, Dingaan, Umpanda's predecessor,\nwhom I had known but too well when I was a lad. He had the same surly\neyes and haughty bearing; also, when he was angry his mouth shut itself\nin the same iron fashion.\n\nOf Umbelazi it is difficult for me to speak without enthusiasm. As\nMameena was the most beautiful woman I ever saw in Zululand--although\nit is true that old war-dog, Umslopogaas, a friend of mine who does not\ncome into this story, used to tell me that Nada the Lily, whom I have\nmentioned, was even lovelier--so Umbelazi was by far the most splendid\nman. Indeed, the Zulus named him \"Umbelazi the Handsome,\" and no wonder.\nTo begin with, he stood at least three inches above the tallest of them;\nfrom a quarter of a mile away I have recognised him by his great\nheight, even through the dust of a desperate battle, and his breadth\nwas proportionate to his stature. Then he was perfectly made, his great,\nshapely limbs ending, like Saduko's, in small hands and feet. His face,\ntoo, was well-cut and open, his colour lighter than Cetewayo's, and his\neyes, which always seemed to smile, were large and dark.\n\nEven before they passed the small gate of the inner fence it was easy\nfor me to see that this royal pair were not upon the best of terms,\nfor each of them tried to get through it first, to show his right of\nprecedence. The result was somewhat ludicrous, for they jammed in the\ngateway. Here, however, Umbelazi's greater weight told, for, putting out\nhis strength, he squeezed his brother into the reeds of the fence, and\nwon through a foot or so in front of him.\n\n\"You grow too fat, my brother,\" I heard Cetewayo say, and saw him scowl\nas he spoke. \"If I had held an assegai in my hand you would have been\ncut.\"\n\n\"I know it, my brother,\" answered Umbelazi, with a good-humoured laugh,\n\"but I knew also that none may appear before the King armed. Had it been\notherwise, I would rather have followed after you.\"\n\nNow, at this hint of Umbelazi's, that he would not trust his brother\nbehind his back with a spear, although it seemed to be conveyed in jest,\nI saw Panda shift uneasily on his seat, while Cetewayo scowled even more\nominously than before. However, no further words passed between them,\nand, walking up to the King side by side, they saluted him with raised\nhands, calling out \"Baba!\"--that is, Father.\n\n\"Greeting, my children,\" said Panda, adding hastily, for he foresaw a\nquarrel as to which of them should take the seat of honour on his right:\n\"Sit there in front of me, both of you, and, Macumazahn, do you come\nhither,\" and he pointed to the coveted place. \"I am a little deaf in my\nleft ear this morning.\"\n\nSo these brothers sat themselves down in front of the King; nor were\nthey, I think, grieved to find this way out of their rivalry; but first\nthey shook hands with me, for I knew them both, though not well, and\neven in this small matter the old trouble arose, since there was\nsome difficulty as to which of them should first offer me his hand.\nUltimately, I remember, Cetewayo won this trick.\n\nWhen these preliminaries were finished, Panda addressed the princes,\nsaying:\n\n\"My sons, I have sent for you to ask your counsel upon a certain\nmatter--not a large matter, but one that may grow.\" And he paused to\ntake snuff, whereon both of them ejaculated:\n\n\"We hear you, Father.\"\n\n\"Well, my sons, the matter is that of Saduko, the son of Matiwane, chief\nof the Amangwane, whom Bangu, chief of the Amakoba, ate up years ago by\nleave of Him who went before me. Now, this Bangu, as you know, has for\nsome time been a thorn in my foot--a thorn that caused it to fester--and\nyet I did not wish to make war on him. So I spoke a word in the ear of\nSaduko, saying, 'He is yours, if you can kill him; and his cattle are\nyours.' Well, Saduko is not dull. With the help of this white man,\nMacumazahn, our friend from of old, he has killed Bangu and taken his\ncattle, and already my foot is beginning to heal.\"\n\n\"We have heard it,\" said Cetewayo.\n\n\"It was a great deed,\" added Umbelazi, a more generous critic.\n\n\"Yes,\" continued Panda, \"I, too, think it was a great deed, seeing that\nSaduko had but a small regiment of wanderers to back him--\"\n\n\"Nay,\" interrupted Cetewayo, \"it was not those eaters of rats who won\nhim the day, it was the wisdom of this Macumazahn.\"\n\n\"Macumazahn's wisdom would have been of little use without the courage\nof Saduko and his rats,\" commented Umbelazi, and from this moment I saw\nthat the two brothers were taking sides for and against Saduko, as they\ndid upon every other matter, not because they cared for the right of\nwhatever was in question, but because they wished to oppose each other.\n\n\"Quite so,\" went on the King; \"I agree with both of you, my sons. But\nthe point is this: I think Saduko a man of promise, and one who should\nbe advanced that he may learn to love us all, especially as his House\nhas suffered wrong from our House, since He-who-is-gone listened to\nthe evil counsel of Bangu, and allowed him to kill out Matiwane's tribe\nwithout just cause. Therefore, in order to wipe away this stain and\nbind Saduko to us, I think it well to re-establish Saduko in the\nchieftainship of the Amangwane, with the lands that his father held, and\nto give him also the chieftainship of the Amakoba, of whom it seems\nthat the women and children, with some of the men, remain, although he\nalready holds their cattle which he has captured in war.\"\n\n\"As the King pleases,\" said Umbelazi, with a yawn, for he was growing\nweary of listening to the case of Saduko.\n\nBut Cetewayo said nothing, for he appeared to be thinking of something\nelse.\n\n\"I think also,\" went on Panda in a rather uncertain voice, \"in order to\nbind him so close that the bonds may never be broken, it would be wise\nto give him a woman of our family in marriage.\"\n\n\"Why should this little Amangwane be allowed to marry into the royal\nHouse?\" asked Cetewayo, looking up. \"If he is dangerous, why not kill\nhim, and have done?\"\n\n\"For this reason, my son. There is trouble ahead in Zululand, and I do\nnot wish to kill those who may help us in that hour, nor do I wish\nthem to become our enemies. I wish that they may be our friends; and\ntherefore it seems to me wise, when we find a seed of greatness, to\nwater it, and not to dig it up or plant it in a neighbour's garden. From\nhis deeds I believe that this Saduko is such a seed.\"\n\n\"Our father has spoken,\" said Umbelazi; \"and I like Saduko, who is a man\nof mettle and good blood. Which of our sisters does our father propose\nto give to him?\"\n\n\"She who is named after the mother of our race, O Umbelazi; she whom\nyour own mother bore--your sister Nandie\" (in English, \"The Sweet\").\n\n\"A great gift, O my Father, since Nandie is both fair and wise. Also,\nwhat does she think of this matter?\"\n\n\"She thinks well of it, Umbelazi, for she has seen Saduko and taken a\nliking to him. She told me herself that she wishes no other husband.\"\n\n\"Is it so?\" replied Umbelazi indifferently. \"Then if the King commands,\nand the King's daughter desires, what more is there to be said?\"\n\n\"Much, I think,\" broke in Cetewayo. \"I hold that it is out of place that\nthis little man, who has but conquered a little tribe by borrowing\nthe wit of Macumazahn here, should be rewarded not only with a\nchieftainship, but with the hand of the wisest and most beautiful of the\nKing's daughters, even though Umbelazi,\" he added, with a sneer, \"should\nbe willing to throw him his own sister like a bone to a passing dog.\"\n\n\"Who threw the bone, Cetewayo?\" asked Umbelazi, awaking out of his\nindifference. \"Was it the King, or was it I, who never heard of the\nmatter till this moment? And who are we that we should question the\nKing's decrees? Is it our business to judge or to obey?\"\n\n\"Has Saduko perchance made you a present of some of those cattle which\nhe stole from the Amakoba, Umbelazi?\" asked Cetewayo. \"As our father\nasks no lobola, perhaps you have taken the gift instead.\"\n\n\"The only gift that I have taken from Saduko,\" said Umbelazi, who, I\ncould see, was hard pressed to keep his temper, \"is that of his service.\nHe is my friend, which is why you hate him, as you hate all my friends.\"\n\n\"Must I then love every stray cur that licks your hand, Umbelazi? Oh, no\nneed to tell me he is your friend, for I know it was you who put it\ninto our father's heart to allow him to kill Bangu and steal his cattle,\nwhich I hold to be an ill deed, for now the Great House is thatched\nwith his reeds and Bangu's blood is on its doorposts. Moreover, he who\nwrought the wrong is to come and dwell therein, and for aught I know\nto be called a prince, like you and me. Why should he not, since the\nPrincess Nandie is to be given to him in marriage? Certainly, Umbelazi,\nyou would do well to take the cattle which this white trader has\nrefused, for all men know that you have earned them.\"\n\nNow Umbelazi sprang up, straightening himself to the full of his great\nheight, and spoke in a voice that was thick with passion.\n\n\"I pray your leave to withdraw, O King,\" he said, \"since if I stay here\nlonger I shall grow sorry that I have no spear in my hand. Yet before I\ngo I will tell the truth. Cetewayo hates Saduko, because, knowing him\nto be a chief of wit and courage, who will grow great, he sought him for\nhis man, saying, 'Sit you in my shadow,' after he had promised to sit in\nmine. Therefore it is that he heaps these taunts upon me. Let him deny\nit if he can.\"\n\n\"That I shall not trouble to do, Umbelazi,\" answered Cetewayo, with a\nscowl. \"Who are you that spy upon my doings, and with a mouth full of\nlies call me to account before the King? I will hear no more of it. Do\nyou bide here and pay Saduko his price with the person of our sister.\nFor, as the King has promised her, his word cannot be changed. Only let\nyour dog know that I keep a stick for him, if he should snarl at me.\nFarewell, my Father. I go upon a journey to my own lordship, the land\nof Gikazi, and there you will find me when you want me, which I pray\nmay not be till after this marriage is finished, for on that I will not\ntrust my eyes to look.\"\n\nThen, with a salute, he turned and departed, bidding no good-bye to his\nbrother.\n\nMy hand, however, he shook in farewell, for Cetewayo was always friendly\nto me, perhaps because he thought I might be useful to him. Also, as I\nlearned afterwards, he was very pleased with me for the reason that I\nhad refused my share of the Amakoba cattle, and that he knew I had no\npart in this proposed marriage between Saduko and Nandie, of which,\nindeed, I now heard for the first time.\n\n\"My Father,\" said Umbelazi, when Cetewayo had gone, \"is this to be\nborne? Am I to blame in the matter? You have heard and seen--answer me,\nmy Father.\"\n\n\"No, you are not to blame this time, Umbelazi,\" replied the King, with a\nheavy sigh. \"But oh! my sons, my sons, where will your quarrelling end?\nI think that only a river of blood can quench so fierce a fire, and then\nwhich of you will live to reach its bank?\"\n\nFor a while he looked at Umbelazi, and I saw love and fear in his eye,\nfor towards him Panda always had more affection than for any of his\nother children.\n\n\"Cetewayo has behaved ill,\" he said at length; \"and before a white man,\nwho will report the matter, which makes it worse. He has no right\nto dictate to me to whom I shall or shall not give my daughters in\nmarriage. Moreover, I have spoken; nor do I change my word because he\nthreatens me. It is known throughout the land that I never change my\nword; and the white men know it also, do they not, O Macumazana?\"\n\nI answered yes, they did. Also, this was true, for, like most weak men,\nPanda was very obstinate, and honest, too, in his own fashion.\n\nHe waved his hand, to show that the subject was ended, then bade\nUmbelazi go to the gate and send a messenger to bring in \"the son of\nMatiwane.\"\n\nPresently Saduko arrived, looking very stately and composed as he lifted\nhis right hand and gave Panda the \"Bay\u00e9te\"--the royal salute.\n\n\"Be seated,\" said the King. \"I have words for your ear.\"\n\nThereon, with the most perfect grace, without hurrying and without undue\ndelay, Saduko crouched himself down upon his knees, with one of his\nelbows resting on the ground, as only a native knows how to do without\nlooking absurd, and waited.\n\n\"Son of Matiwane,\" said the King, \"I have heard all the story of how,\nwith a small company, you destroyed Bangu and most of the men of the\nAmakoba, and ate up their cattle every one.\"\n\n\"Your pardon, Black One,\" interrupted Saduko. \"I am but a boy, I did\nnothing. It was Macumazahn, Watcher-by-Night, who sits yonder. His\nwisdom taught me how to snare the Amakoba, after they were decoyed from\ntheir mountain, and it was Tshoza, my uncle, who loosed the cattle from\nthe kraals. I say that I did nothing, except to strike a blow or two\nwith a spear when I must, just as a baboon throws stones at those who\nwould steal its young.\"\n\n\"I am glad to see that you are no boaster, Saduko,\" said Panda. \"Would\nthat more of the Zulus were like you in that matter, for then I must not\nlisten to so many loud songs about little things. At least, Bangu was\nkilled and his proud tribe humbled, and, for reasons of state, I am glad\nthat this happened without my moving a regiment or being mixed up with\nthe business, for I tell you that there are some of my family who loved\nBangu. But I--I loved your father, Matiwane, whom Bangu butchered, for\nwe were brought up together as boys--yes, and served together in the\nsame regiment, the Amawombe, when the Wild One, my brother, ruled\"\n(he meant Chaka, for among the Zulus the names of dead kings are\nhlonipa--that is, they must not be spoken if it can be avoided).\n\"Therefore,\" went on Panda, \"for this reason, and for others, I am glad\nthat Bangu has been punished, and that, although vengeance has crawled\nafter him like a footsore bull, at length he has been tossed with its\nhorns and crushed with its knees.\"\n\n\"Yebo, Ngonyama!\" (Yes, O Lion!) said Saduko.\n\n\"Now, Saduko,\" went on Panda, \"because you are your father's son, and\nbecause you have shown yourself a man, although you are still little\nin the land, I am minded to advance you. Therefore I give to you the\nchieftainship over those who remain of the Amakoba and over all of the\nAmangwane blood whom you can gather.\"\n\n\"Bay\u00e9te! As the King pleases,\" said Saduko.\n\n\"And I give you leave to become a kehla--a wearer of the\nhead-ring--although, as you have said, you are still but a boy, and with\nit a place upon my Council.\"\n\n\"Bay\u00e9te! As the King pleases,\" said Saduko, still apparently unmoved by\nthe honours that were being heaped upon him.\n\n\"And, Son of Matiwane,\" went on Panda, \"you are still unmarried, are you\nnot?\"\n\nNow, for the first time, Saduko's face changed. \"Yes, Black One,\" he\nsaid hurriedly, \"but--\"\n\nHere he caught my eye, and, reading some warning in it, was silent.\n\n\"But,\" repeated Panda after him, \"doubtless you would like to be? Well,\nit is natural in a young man who wishes to found a House, and therefore\nI give you leave to marry.\"\n\n\"Yebo, Silo!\" (Yes, O Wild Beast!) \"I thank the King, but--\"\n\nHere I sneezed loudly, and he ceased.\n\n\"But,\" repeated Panda, \"of course, you do not know where to find a wife\nbetween the time the hawk stoops and the rat squeaks in its claws. How\nshould you who have never thought of the matter? Also,\" he continued,\nwith a smile, \"it is well that you have not thought of it, since she\nwhom I shall give to you could not live in the second hut in your kraal\nand call another 'Inkosikazi' [that is, head lady or chieftainess].\nUmbelazi, my son, go fetch her of whom we have thought as a bride for\nthis boy.\"\n\nNow Umbelazi rose, and went with a broad smile upon his face, while\nPanda, somewhat fatigued with all his speech-making--for he was very\nfat and the day was very hot--leaned his head back against the hut and\nclosed his eyes.\n\n\"O Black One! O thou who consumeth with rage! [Dhlangamandhla]\" broke\nout Saduko, who, I could see, was much disturbed. \"I have something to\nsay to you.\"\n\n\"No doubt, no doubt,\" answered Panda drowsily, \"but save up your thanks\ntill you have seen, or you will have none left afterwards,\" and he\nsnored slightly.\n\nNow I, perceiving that Saduko was about to ruin himself, thought it well\nto interfere, though what business of mine it was to do so I cannot say.\nAt any rate, if only I had held my tongue at this moment, and allowed\nSaduko to make a fool of himself, as he wished to do--for where Mameena\nwas concerned he never could be wise--I verily believe that all the\nhistory of Zululand would have run a different course, and that many\nthousands of men, white and black, who are now dead would be alive\nto-day. But Fate ordered it otherwise. Yes, it was not I who spoke, but\nFate. The Angel of Doom used my throat as his trumpet.\n\nSeeing that Panda dozed, I slipped behind Saduko and gripped him by the\narm.\n\n\"Are you mad?\" I whispered into his ear. \"Will you throw away your\nfortune, and your life also?\"\n\n\"But Mameena,\" he whispered back. \"I would marry none save Mameena.\"\n\n\"Fool!\" I answered. \"Mameena has betrayed and spat upon you. Take what\nthe Heavens send you and give thanks. Would you wear Masapo's soiled\nblanket?\"\n\n\"Macumazahn,\" he said in a hollow voice, \"I will follow your head, and\nnot my own heart. Yet you sow a strange seed, Macumazahn, or so you may\nthink when you see its fruit.\" And he gave me a wild look--a look that\nfrightened me.\n\nThere was something in this look which caused me to reflect that I might\ndo well to go away and leave Saduko, Mameena, Nandie, and the rest of\nthem to \"dree their weirds,\" as the Scotch say, for, after all, what was\nmy finger doing in that very hot stew? Getting burnt, I thought, and not\ncollecting any stew.\n\nYet, looking back on these events, how could I foresee what would be the\nend of the madness of Saduko, of the fearful machinations of Mameena,\nand of the weakness of Umbelazi when she snared him in the net of her\nbeauty, thus bringing about his ruin, through the hate of Saduko and the\nambition of Cetewayo? How could I know that, at the back of all these\nevents, stood the old dwarf, Zikali the Wise, working night and day\nto slake the enmity and fulfil the vengeance which long ago he had\nconceived and planned against the royal House of Senzangakona and the\nZulu people over whom it ruled?\n\nYes, he stood there like a man behind a great stone upon the brow of\na mountain, slowly, remorselessly, with infinite skill, labour, and\npatience, pushing that stone to the edge of the cliff, whence at length,\nin the appointed hour, it would thunder down upon those who dwelt\nbeneath, to leave them crushed and no more a people. How could I guess\nthat we, the actors in this play, were all the while helping him to push\nthat stone, and that he cared nothing how many of us were carried with\nit into the abyss, if only we brought about the triumph of his secret,\nunutterable rage and hate?\n\nNow I see and understand all these things, as it is easy to do, but then\nI was blind; nor did the Voices reach my dull ears to warn me, as, how\nor why I cannot tell, they did, I believe, reach those of Zikali.\n\nOh, what was the sum of it? Just this, I think, and nothing more--that,\nas Saduko and the others were Mameena's tools, and as all of them and\ntheir passions were Zikali's tools, so he himself was the tool of some\nunseen Power that used him and us to accomplish its design. Which, I\nsuppose, is fatalism, or, in other words, all these things happened\nbecause they must happen. A poor conclusion to reach after so much\nthought and striving, and not complimentary to man and his boasted\npowers of free will; still, one to which many of us are often driven,\nespecially if we have lived among savages, where such dramas work\nthemselves out openly and swiftly, unhidden from our eyes by the veils\nand subterfuges of civilisation. At least, there is this comfort\nabout it--that, if we are but feathers blown by the wind, how can the\nindividual feather be blamed because it did not travel against, turn or\nkeep back the wind?\n\nWell, let me return from these speculations to the history of the facts\nthat caused them.\n\nJust as--a little too late--I had made up my mind that I would go after\nmy own business, and leave Saduko to manage his, through the fence\ngateway appeared the great, tall Umbelazi leading by the hand a woman.\nAs I saw in a moment, it did not need certain bangles of copper,\nornaments of ivory and of very rare pink beads, called infibinga, which\nonly those of the royal House were permitted to wear, to proclaim her\na person of rank, for dignity and high blood were apparent in her face,\nher carriage, her gestures, and all that had to do with her.\n\nNandie the Sweet was not a great beauty, as was Mameena, although\nher figure was fine, and her stature like that of all the race of\nSenzangakona--considerably above the average. To begin with, she was\ndarker in hue, and her lips were rather thick, as was her nose; nor were\nher eyes large and liquid like those of an antelope. Further, she lacked\nthe informing mystery of Mameena's face, that at times was broken and\nlit up by flashes of alluring light and quick, sympathetic perception,\nas a heavy evening sky, that seems to join the dim earth to the dimmer\nheavens, is illuminated by pulsings of fire, soft and many-hued,\nsuggesting, but not revealing, the strength and splendour that it veils.\nNandie had none of these attractions, which, after all, anywhere upon\nthe earth belong only to a few women in each generation. She was a\nsimple, honest-natured, kindly, affectionate young woman of high birth,\nno more; that is, as these qualities are understood and expressed among\nher people.\n\nUmbelazi led her forward into the presence of the King, to whom she\nbowed gracefully enough. Then, after casting a swift, sidelong glance at\nSaduko, which I found it difficult to interpret, and another of inquiry\nat me, she folded her hands upon her breast and stood silent, with bent\nhead, waiting to be addressed.\n\nThe address was brief enough, for Panda was still sleepy.\n\n\"My daughter,\" he said, with a yawn, \"there stands your husband,\" and\nhe jerked his thumb towards Saduko. \"He is a young man and a brave, and\nunmarried; also one who should grow great in the shadow of our House,\nespecially as he is a friend of your brother, Umbelazi. I understand\nalso that you have seen him and like him. Unless you have anything to\nsay against it, for as, not being a common father, the King receives no\ncattle--at least in this case--I am not prejudiced, but will listen to\nyour words,\" and he chuckled in a drowsy fashion. \"I propose that\nthe marriage should take place to-morrow. Now, my daughter, have you\nanything to say? For if so, please say it at once, as I am tired. The\neternal wranglings between your brethren, Cetewayo and Umbelazi, have\nworn me out.\"\n\nNow Nandie looked about her in her open, honest fashion, her gaze\nresting first on Saduko, then on Umbelazi, and lastly upon me.\n\n\"My Father,\" she said at length, in her soft, steady voice, \"tell me, I\nbeseech you, who proposes this marriage? Is it the Chief Saduko, is it\nthe Prince Umbelazi, or is it the white lord whose true name I do not\nknow, but who is called Macumazahn, Watcher-by-Night?\"\n\n\"I can't remember which of them proposed it,\" yawned Panda. \"Who can\nkeep on talking about things from night till morning? At any rate, I\npropose it, and I will make your husband a big man among our people.\nHave you anything to say against it?\"\n\n\"I have nothing to say, my Father. I have met Saduko, and like him\nwell--for the rest, you are the judge. But,\" she added slowly, \"does\nSaduko like me? When he speaks my name, does he feel it here?\" and she\npointed to her throat.\n\n\"I am sure I do not know what he feels in his throat,\" Panda replied\ntestily, \"but I feel that mine is dry. Well, as no one says anything,\nthe matter is settled. To-morrow Saduko shall give the umqoliso [the\nOx of the Girl], that makes marriage--if he has not got one here I will\nlend it to him, and you can take the new, big hut that I have built in\nthe outer kraal to dwell in for the present. There will be a dance, if\nyou wish it; if not, I do not care, for I have no wish for ceremony just\nnow, who am too troubled with great matters. Now I am going to sleep.\"\n\nThen sinking from his stool on to his knees, Panda crawled through the\ndoorway of his great hut, which was close to him, and vanished.\n\nUmbelazi and I departed also through the gateway of the fence, leaving\nSaduko and the Princess Nandie alone together, for there were no\nattendants present. What happened between them I am sure I do not\nknow, but I gather that, in one way or another, Saduko made himself\nsufficiently agreeable to the princess to persuade her to take him to\nhusband. Perhaps, being already enamoured of him, she was not difficult\nto persuade. At any rate, on the morrow, without any great feasting or\nfuss, except the customary dance, the umqoliso, the \"Ox of the Girl,\"\nwas slaughtered, and Saduko became the husband of a royal maiden of the\nHouse of Senzangakona.\n\nCertainly, as I remember reflecting, it was a remarkable rise in life\nfor one who, but a few months before, had been without possessions or a\nhome.\n\nI may add that, after our brief talk in the King's kraal, while Panda\nwas dozing, I had no further words with Saduko on this matter of his\nmarriage, for between its proposal and the event he avoided me, nor did\nI seek him out. On the day of the marriage also, I trekked for Natal,\nand for a whole year heard no more of Saduko, Nandie, and Mameena;\nalthough, to be frank, I must admit I thought of the last of these\npersons more often, perhaps, than I should have done.\n\nThe truth is that Mameena was one of those women who sticks in a man's\nmind even more closely than a \"Wait-a-bit\" thorn does in his coat.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. ALLAN RETURNS TO ZULULAND\n\n\nA whole year had gone by, in which I did, or tried to do, various things\nthat have no connection with this story, when once more I found\nmyself in Zululand--at Umbezi's kraal indeed. Hither I had trekked in\nfulfilment of a certain bargain, already alluded to, that was concerned\nwith ivory and guns, which I had made with the old fellow, or, rather,\nwith Masapo, his son-in-law, whom he represented in this matter. Into\nthe exact circumstances of that bargain I do not enter, since at the\nmoment I cannot recall whether I ever obtained the necessary permit\nto import those guns into Zululand, although now that I am older I\nearnestly hope that I did so, since it is wrong to sell weapons to\nnatives that may be put to all sorts of unforeseen uses.\n\nAt any rate, there I was, sitting alone with the Headman in his hut\ndiscussing a dram of \"squareface\" that I had given to him, for the\n\"trade\" was finished to our mutual satisfaction, and Scowl, my body\nservant, with the hunters, had just carried off the ivory--a fine lot of\ntusks--to my wagons.\n\n\"Well, Umbezi,\" I said, \"and how has it fared with you since we parted a\nyear ago? Have you seen anything of Saduko, who, you may remember, left\nyou in some wrath?\"\n\n\"Thanks be to my Spirit, I have seen nothing of that wild man,\nMacumazahn,\" answered Umbezi, shaking his fat old head in a fashion\nwhich showed great anxiety. \"Yet I have heard of him, for he sent me a\nmessage the other day to tell me that he had not forgotten what he owed\nme.\"\n\n\"Did he mean the sticks with which he promised to bray you like a green\nhide?\" I inquired innocently.\n\n\"I think so, Macumazahn--I think so, for certainly he owes me nothing\nelse. And the worst of it is that, there at Panda's kraal, he has grown\nlike a pumpkin on a dung heap--great, great!\"\n\n\"And therefore is now one who can pay any debt that he owes, Umbezi,\" I\nsaid, taking a pull at the \"squareface\" and looking at him over the top\nof the pannikin.\n\n\"Doubtless he can, Macumazahn, and, between you and me, that is the real\nreason why I--or rather Masapo--was so anxious to get those guns. They\nwere not for hunting, as he told you by the messenger, or for war, but\nto protect us against Saduko, in case he should attack. Well, now I hope\nwe shall be able to hold our own.\"\n\n\"You and Masapo must teach your people to use them first, Umbezi. But\nI expect Saduko has forgotten all about both of you now that he is the\nhusband of a princess of the royal blood. Tell me, how goes it with\nMameena?\"\n\n\"Oh, well, well, Macumazahn. For is she not the head lady of the\nAmasomi? There is nothing wrong with her--nothing at all, except that as\nyet she has no child; also that--,\" and he paused.\n\n\"That what?\" I asked.\n\n\"That she hates the very sight of her husband, Masapo, and says that\nshe would rather be married to a baboon--yes, to a baboon--than to him,\nwhich gives him offence, after he has paid so many cattle for her.\nBut what of this, Macumazahn? There is always a grain missing upon\nthe finest head of corn. Nothing is _quite_ perfect in the world,\nMacumazahn, and if Mameena does not chance to love her husband--\" and he\nshrugged his shoulders and drank some \"squareface.\"\n\n\"Of course it does not matter in the least, Umbezi, except to Mameena\nand her husband, who no doubt will settle down in time, now that Saduko\nis married to a princess of the Zulu House.\"\n\n\"I hope so, Macumazahn, but, to tell the truth, I wish you had brought\nmore guns, for I live amongst a terrible lot of people. Masapo, who is\nfurious with Mameena because she will have none of him, and therefore\nwith me, as though I could control Mameena; Mameena, who is mad with\nMasapo, and therefore with me, because I gave her in marriage to him;\nSaduko, who foams at the mouth at the name of Masapo, because he has\nmarried Mameena, whom, it is said, he still loves, and therefore at me,\nbecause I am her father and did my best to settle her in the world. Oh,\ngive me some more of that fire-water, Macumazahn, for it makes me forget\nall these things, and especially that my guardian spirit made me the\nfather of Mameena, with whom you would not run away when you might have\ndone so. Oh, Macumazahn, why did you not run away with Mameena, and turn\nher into a quiet white woman who ties herself up in sacks, sings songs\nto the 'Great-Great' in the sky--[that is, hymns to the Power above\nus]--and never thinks of any man who is not her husband?\"\n\n\"Because if I had done so, Umbezi, I should have ceased to be a quiet\nwhite man. Yes, yes, my friend, I should have been in some such place as\nyours to-day, and that is the last thing that I wish. And now, Umbezi,\nyou have had quite enough 'squareface,' so I will take the bottle away\nwith me. Good-night.\"\n\n\nOn the following morning I trekked very early from Umbezi's\nkraal--before he was up indeed, for the \"squareface\" made him sleep\nsound. My destination was Nodwengu, Panda's Great Place, where I hoped\nto do some trading, but, as I was in no particular hurry, my plan was\nto go round by Masapo's, and see for myself how it fared between him and\nMameena. Indeed, I reached the borders of the Amasomi territory, whereof\nMasapo was chief, by evening, and camped there. But with the night came\nreflection, and reflection told me that I should do well to keep clear\nof Mameena and her domestic complications, if she had any. So I changed\nmy mind, and next morning trekked on to Nodwengu by the only route\nthat my guides reported to be practicable, one which took me a long way\nround.\n\nThat day, owing to the roughness of the road--if road it could be\ncalled--and an accident to one of the wagons, we only covered about\nfifteen miles, and as night fell were obliged to outspan at the first\nspot where we could find water. When the oxen had been unyoked I\nlooked about me, and saw that we were in a place that, although I had\napproached it from a somewhat different direction, I recognised at once\nas the mouth of the Black Kloof, in which, over a year before, I had\ninterviewed Zikali the Little and Wise. There was no mistaking the\nspot; that blasted valley, with the piled-up columns of boulders and the\noverhanging cliff at the end of it, have, so far as I am aware, no exact\ncounterparts in Africa.\n\nI sat upon the box of the first wagon, eating my food, which consisted\nof some biltong and biscuit, for I had not bothered to shoot any game\nthat day, which was very hot, and wondering whether Zikali were still\nalive, also whether I should take the trouble to walk up the kloof and\nfind out. On the whole I thought that I would not, as the place repelled\nme, and I did not particularly wish to hear any more of his prophecies\nand fierce, ill-omened talk. So I just sat there studying the wonderful\neffect of the red evening light pouring up between those walls of\nfantastic rocks.\n\nPresently I perceived, far away, a single human figure--whether it were\nman or woman I could not tell--walking towards me along the path which\nran at the bottom of the cleft. In those gigantic surroundings it\nlooked extraordinarily small and lonely, although perhaps because of the\nintense red light in which it was bathed, or perhaps just because it\nwas human, a living thing in the midst of all that still, inanimate\ngrandeur, it caught and focused my attention. I grew greatly interested\nin it; I wondered if it were that of man or woman, and what it was doing\nhere in this haunted valley.\n\nThe figure drew nearer, and now I saw it was slender and tall, like that\nof a lad or of a well-grown woman, but to which sex it belonged I could\nnot see, because it was draped in a cloak of beautiful grey fur. Just\nthen Scowl came to the other side of the wagon to speak to me about\nsomething, which took off my attention for the next two minutes. When I\nlooked round again it was to see the figure standing within three yards\nof me, its face hidden by a kind of hood which was attached to the fur\ncloak.\n\n\"Who are you, and what is your business?\" I asked, whereon a gentle\nvoice answered:\n\n\"Do you not know me, O Macumazana?\"\n\n\"How can I know one who is tied up like a gourd in a mat? Yet is it\nnot--is it not--\"\n\n\"Yes, it is Mameena, and I am very pleased that you should remember my\nvoice, Macumazahn, after we have been separated for such a long, long\ntime,\" and, with a sudden movement, she threw back the kaross, hood and\nall, revealing herself in all her strange beauty.\n\nI jumped down off the wagon-box and took her hand.\n\n\"O Macumazana,\" she said, while I still held it--or, to be accurate,\nwhile she still held mine--\"indeed my heart is glad to see a friend\nagain,\" and she looked at me with her appealing eyes, which, in the red\nlight, I could see appeared to float in tears.\n\n\"A friend, Mameena!\" I exclaimed. \"Why, now you are so rich, and the\nwife of a big chief, you must have plenty of friends.\"\n\n\"Alas! Macumazahn, I am rich in nothing except trouble, for my husband\nsaves, like the ants for winter. Why, he even grudged me this poor\nkaross; and as for friends, he is so jealous that he will not allow me\nany.\"\n\n\"He cannot be jealous of women, Mameena!\"\n\n\"Oh, women! Piff! I do not care for women; they are very unkind to me,\nbecause--because--well, perhaps you can guess why, Macumazahn,\"\nshe answered, glancing at her own reflection in a little travelling\nlooking-glass that hung from the woodwork of the wagon, for I had been\nusing it to brush my hair, and smiled very sweetly.\n\n\"At least you have your husband, Mameena, and I thought that perhaps by\nthis time--\"\n\nShe held up her hand.\n\n\"My husband! Oh, I would that I had him not, for I hate him, Macumazahn;\nand as for the rest--never! The truth is that I never cared for any man\nexcept one whose name _you_ may chance to remember, Macumazahn.\"\n\n\"I suppose you mean Saduko--\" I began.\n\n\"Tell me, Macumazahn,\" she inquired innocently, \"are white people very\nstupid? I ask because you do not seem as clever as you used to be. Or\nhave you perhaps a bad memory?\"\n\nNow I felt myself turning red as the sky behind me, and broke in\nhurriedly:\n\n\"If you did not like your husband, Mameena, you should not have married\nhim. You know you need not unless you wished.\"\n\n\"When one has only two thorn bushes to sit on, Macumazahn, one chooses\nthat which seems to have the fewest prickles, to discover sometimes that\nthey are still there in hundreds, although one did not see them. You\nknow that at length everyone gets tired of standing.\"\n\n\"Is that why you have taken to walking, Mameena? I mean, what are you\ndoing here alone?\"\n\n\"I? Oh, I heard that you were passing this way, and came to have a talk\nwith you. No, from you I cannot hide even the least bit of the truth. I\ncame to talk with you, but also I came to see Zikali and ask him what a\nwife should do who hates her husband.\"\n\n\"Indeed! And what did he answer you?\"\n\n\"He answered that he thought she had better run away with another man,\nif there were one whom she did not hate--out of Zululand, of course,\"\nshe replied, looking first at me and then at my wagon and the two horses\nthat were tied to it.\n\n\"Is that all he said, Mameena?\"\n\n\"No. Have I not told you that I cannot hide one grain of the truth from\nyou? He added that the only other thing to be done was to sit still and\ndrink my sour milk, pretending that it is sweet, until my Spirit gives\nme a new cow. He seemed to think that my Spirit would be bountiful in\nthe matter of new cows--one day.\"\n\n\"Anything more?\" I inquired.\n\n\"One little thing. Have I not told you that you shall have all--all the\ntruth? Zikali seemed to think also that at last every one of my herd of\ncows, old and new, would come to a bad end. He did not tell me to what\nend.\"\n\nShe turned her head aside, and when she looked up again I saw that she\nwas weeping, really weeping this time, not just making her eyes swim, as\nshe did before.\n\n\"Of course they will come to a bad end, Macumazahn,\" she went on in a\nsoft, thick voice, \"for I and all with whom I have to do were 'torn out\nof the reeds' [i.e. created] that way. And that's why I won't tempt you\nto run away with me any more, as I meant to do when I saw you, because\nit is true, Macumazahn you are the only man I ever liked or ever\nshall like; and you know I could make you run away with me if I chose,\nalthough I am black and you are white--oh, yes, before to-morrow\nmorning. But I won't do it; for why should I catch you in my unlucky web\nand bring you into all sorts of trouble among my people and your own? Go\nyou your road, Macumazahn, and I will go mine as the wind blows me. And\nnow give me a cup of water and let me be away--a cup of water, no more.\nOh, do not be afraid for me, or melt too much, lest I should melt also.\nI have an escort waiting over yonder hill. There, thank you for your\nwater, Macumazahn, and good night. Doubtless we shall meet again ere\nlong, and-- I forgot; the Little Wise One said he would like to have a\ntalk with you. Good night, Macumazahn, good night. I trust that you did\na profitable trade with Umbezi my father and Masapo my husband. I wonder\nwhy such men as these should have been chosen to be my father and my\nhusband. Think it over, Macumazahn, and tell me when next we meet. Give\nme that pretty mirror, Macumazahn; when I look in it I shall see you\nas well as myself, and that will please me--you don't know how much. I\nthank you. Good night.\"\n\nIn another minute I was watching her solitary little figure, now wrapped\nagain in the hooded kaross, as it vanished over the brow of the rise\nbehind us, and really, as she went, I felt a lump rising in my throat.\nNotwithstanding all her wickedness--and I suppose she was wicked--there\nwas something horribly attractive about Mameena.\n\nWhen she had gone, taking my only looking-glass with her, and the lump\nin my throat had gone also, I began to wonder how much fact there was in\nher story. She had protested so earnestly that she told me all the truth\nthat I felt sure there must be something left behind. Also I remembered\nshe had said Zikali wanted to see me. Well, the end of it was I took a\nmoonlight walk up that dreadful gorge, into which not even Scowl would\naccompany me, because he declared that the place was well known to be\nhaunted by imikovu, or spectres who have been raised from the dead by\nwizards.\n\nIt was a long and disagreeable walk, and somehow I felt very depressed\nand insignificant as I trudged on between those gigantic cliffs, passing\nnow through patches of bright moonlight and now through deep pools of\nshadow, threading my way among clumps of bush or round the bases of tall\npillars of piled-up stones, till at length I came to the overhanging\ncliffs at the end, which frowned down on me like the brows of some\ntitanic demon.\n\nWell, I got to the end at last, and at the gate of the kraal fence was\nmet by one of those fierce and huge men who served the dwarf as guards.\nSuddenly he emerged from behind a stone, and having scanned me for\na moment in silence, beckoned to me to follow him, as though I were\nexpected. A minute later I found myself face to face with Zikali, who\nwas seated in the clear moonlight just outside the shadow of his hut,\nand engaged, apparently, in his favourite occupation of carving wood\nwith a rough native knife of curious shape.\n\nFor a while he took no notice of me; then suddenly looked up, shaking\nback his braided grey locks, and broke into one of his great laughs.\n\n\"So it is you, Macumazahn,\" he said. \"Well, I knew you were passing my\nway and that Mameena would send you here. But why do you come to see the\n'Thing-that-should-not-have-been-born'? To tell me how you fared with\nthe buffalo with the split horn, eh?\"\n\n\"No, Zikali, for why should I tell you what you know already? Mameena\nsaid you wished to talk with me, that was all.\"\n\n\"Then Mameena lied,\" he answered, \"as is her nature, in whose throat\nlive four false words for every one of truth. Still, sit down,\nMacumazahn. There is beer made ready for you by that stool; and give me\nthe knife and a pinch of the white man's snuff that you have brought for\nme as a present.\"\n\nI produced these articles, though how he knew that I had them with me\nI cannot tell, nor did I think it worth while to inquire. The snuff, I\nremember, pleased him very much, but of the knife he said that it was\na pretty toy, but he would not know how to use it. Then we fell to\ntalking.\n\n\"What was Mameena doing here?\" I asked boldly.\n\n\"What was she doing at your wagons?\" he asked. \"Oh, do not stop to tell\nme; I know, I know. That is a very good Snake of yours, Macumazahn,\nwhich always just lets you slip through her fingers, when, if she\nchose to close her hand-- Well, well, I do not betray the secrets of\nmy clients; but I say this to you--go on to the kraal of the son of\nSenzangakona, and you will see things happen that will make you laugh,\nfor Mameena will be there, and the mongrel Masapo, her husband. Truly\nshe hates him well, and, after all, I would rather be loved than hated\nby Mameena, though both are dangerous. Poor Mongrel! Soon the jackals\nwill be chewing his bones.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that?\" I asked.\n\n\"Only because Mameena tells me that he is a great wizard, and the\njackals eat many wizards in Zululand. Also he is an enemy of Panda's\nHouse, is he not?\"\n\n\"You have been giving her some bad counsel, Zikali,\" I said, blurting\nout the thought in my mind.\n\n\"Perhaps, perhaps, Macumazahn; only I may call it good counsel. I have\nmy own road to walk, and if I can find some to clear away the thorns\nthat would prick my feet, what of it? Also she will get her pay, who\nfinds life dull up there among the Amasomi, with one she hates for a\nhut-fellow. Go you and watch, and afterwards, when you have an hour to\nspare, come and tell me what happens--that is, if I do not chance to be\nthere to see for myself.\"\n\n\"Is Saduko well?\" I asked to change the subject, for I did not wish to\nbecome privy to the plots that filled the air.\n\n\"I am told that his tree grows great, that it overshadows all the royal\nkraal. I think that Mameena wishes to sleep in the shade of it. And now\nyou are weary, and so am I. Go back to your wagons, Macumazahn, for I\nhave nothing more to say to you to-night. But be sure to return and tell\nme what chances at Panda's kraal. Or, as I have said, perhaps I shall\nmeet you there. Who knows, who knows?\"\n\nNow, it will be observed that there was nothing very remarkable in this\nconversation between Zikali and myself. He did not tell me any deep\nsecrets or make any great prophecy. It may be wondered, indeed, when\nthere is so much to record, why I set it down at all.\n\nMy answer is, because of the extraordinary impression that it produced\nupon me. Although so little was said, I felt all the while that those\nfew words were a veil hiding terrible events to be. I was sure that\nsome dreadful scheme had been hatched between the old dwarf and Mameena\nwhereof the issue would soon become apparent, and that he had sent me\naway in a hurry after he learned that she had told me nothing, because\nhe feared lest I should stumble on its cue and perhaps cause it to fail.\n\nAt any rate, as I walked back to my wagons by moonlight down that\ndreadful gorge, the hot, thick air seemed to me to have a physical taste\nand smell of blood, and the dank foliage of the tropical trees that grew\nthere, when now and again a puff of wind stirred them, moaned like the\nfabled imikovu, or as men might do in their last faint agony. The effect\nupon my nerves was quite strange, for when at last I reached my wagons I\nwas shaking like a reed, and a cold perspiration, unnatural enough upon\nthat hot night, poured from my face and body.\n\nWell, I took a couple of stiff tots of \"squareface\" to pull myself\ntogether, and at length went to sleep, to awake before dawn with a\nheadache. Looking out of the wagon, to my surprise I saw Scowl and the\nhunters, who should have been snoring, standing in a group and talking\nto each other in frightened whispers. I called Scowl to me and asked\nwhat was the matter.\n\n\"Nothing, Baas,\" he said with a shamefaced air; \"only there are so many\nspooks about this place. They have been passing in and out of it all\nnight.\"\n\n\"Spooks, you idiot!\" I answered. \"Probably they were people going to\nvisit the Nyanga, Zikali.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, Baas; only then we do not know why they should all look like\ndead people--princes, some of them, by their dress--and walk upon the\nair a man's height from the ground.\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" I replied. \"Do you not know the difference between owls in the\nmist and dead kings? Make ready, for we trek at once; the air here is\nfull of fever.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Baas,\" he said, springing off to obey; and I do not think I\never remember two wagons being got under way quicker than they were that\nmorning.\n\nI merely mention this nonsense to show that the Black Kloof could affect\nother people's nerves as well as my own.\n\n\nIn due course I reached Nodwengu without accident, having sent forward\none of my hunters to report my approach to Panda. When my wagons arrived\noutside the Great Place they were met by none other than my old friend,\nMaputa, he who had brought me back the pills before our attack upon\nBangu.\n\n\"Greeting, Macumazahn,\" he said. \"I am sent by the King to say that you\nare welcome and to point you out a good place to outspan; also to give\nyou permission to trade as much as you will in this town, since he knows\nthat your dealings are always fair.\"\n\nI returned my thanks in the usual fashion, adding that I had brought a\nlittle present for the King which I would deliver when it pleased him\nto receive me. Then I invited Maputa, to whom I also offered some trifle\nwhich delighted him very much, to ride with me on the wagon-box till we\ncame to the selected outspan.\n\nThis, by the way, proved, to be a very good place indeed, a little\nvalley full of grass for the cattle--for by the King's order it had not\nbeen grazed--with a stream of beautiful water running down it. Moreover\nit overlooked a great open space immediately in front of the main gate\nof the town, so that I could see everything that went on and all who\narrived or departed.\n\n\"You will be comfortable here, Macumazahn,\" said Maputa, \"during your\nstay, which we hope will be long, since, although there will soon be\na mighty crowd at Nodwengu, the King has given orders that none except\nyour own servants are to enter this valley.\"\n\n\"I thank the King; but why will there be a crowd, Maputa?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" he answered with a shrug of the shoulders, \"because of a new\nthing. All the tribes of the Zulus are to come up to be reviewed.\nSome say that Cetewayo has brought this about, and some say that it is\nUmbelazi. But I am sure that it is the work of neither of these, but of\nSaduko, your old friend, though what his object is I cannot tell you.\nI only trust,\" he added uneasily, \"that it will not end in bloodshed\nbetween the Great Brothers.\"\n\n\"So Saduko has grown tall, Maputa?\"\n\n\"Tall as a tree, Macumazahn. His whisper in the King's ear is louder\nthan the shouts of others. Moreover, he has become a 'self-eater' [that\nis a Zulu term which means one who is very haughty]. You will have to\nwait on him, Macumazahn; he will not wait on you.\"\n\n\"Is it so?\" I answered. \"Well, tall trees are blown down sometimes.\"\n\nHe nodded his wise old head. \"Yes, Macumazahn; I have seen plenty grow\nand fall in my time, for at last the swimmer goes with the stream.\nAnyhow, you will be able to do a good trade among so many, and, whatever\nhappens, none will harm you whom all love. And now farewell; I bear your\nmessages to the King, who sends an ox for you to kill lest you should\ngrow hungry in his house.\"\n\nThat same evening I saw Saduko and the others, as I shall tell. I had\nbeen up to visit the King and give him my present, a case of English\ntable-knives with bone handles, which pleased him greatly, although\nhe did not in the least know how to use them. Indeed, without their\naccompanying forks these are somewhat futile articles. I found the old\nfellow very tired and anxious, but as he was surrounded by indunas, I\nhad no private talk with him. Seeing that he was busy, I took my leave\nas soon as I could, and when I walked away whom should I meet but\nSaduko.\n\nI saw him while he was a good way off, advancing towards the inner gate\nwith a train of attendants like a royal personage, and knew very well\nthat he saw me. Making up my mind what to do at once, I walked straight\non to him, forcing him to give me the path, which he did not wish to\ndo before so many people, and brushed past him as though he were a\nstranger. As I expected, this treatment had the desired effect, for\nafter we had passed each other he turned and said:\n\n\"Do you not know me, Macumazahn?\"\n\n\"Who calls?\" I asked. \"Why, friend, your face is familiar to me. How are\nyou named?\"\n\n\"Have you forgotten Saduko?\" he said in a pained voice.\n\n\"No, no, of course not,\" I answered. \"I know you now, although you seem\nsomewhat changed since we went out hunting and fighting together--I\nsuppose because you are fatter. I trust that you are well, Saduko?\nGood-bye. I must be going back to my wagons. If you wish to see me you\nwill find me there.\"\n\nThese remarks, I may add, seemed to take Saduko very much aback. At any\nrate, he found no reply to them, even when old Maputa, with whom I was\nwalking, and some others sniggered aloud. There is nothing that Zulus\nenjoy so much as seeing one whom they consider an upstart set in his\nplace.\n\nWell, a couple of hours afterwards, just as the sun was sinking, who\nshould walk up to my wagons but Saduko himself, accompanied by a woman\nwhom I recognised at once as his wife, the Princess Nandie, who carried\na fine baby boy in her arms. Rising, I saluted Nandie and offered her my\ncamp-stool, which she looked at suspiciously and declined, preferring to\nseat herself on the ground after the native fashion. So I took it back\nagain, and after I had sat down on it, not before, stretched out my hand\nto Saduko, who by this time was quite humble and polite.\n\nWell, we talked away, and by degrees, without seeming too much\ninterested in them, I was furnished with a list of all the advancements\nwhich it had pleased Panda to heap upon Saduko during the past year. In\ntheir way they were remarkable enough, for it was much as though some\npenniless country gentleman in England had been promoted in that short\nspace of time to be one of the premier peers of the kingdom and endowed\nwith great offices and estates. When he had finished the count of them\nhe paused, evidently waiting for me to congratulate him. But all I said\nwas:\n\n\"By the Heavens above I am sorry for you, Saduko! How many enemies\nyou must have made! What a long way there will be for you to fall one\nnight!\"--a remark at which the quiet Nandie broke into a low laugh that\nI think pleased her husband even less than my sarcasm. \"Well,\" I went\non, \"I see that you have got a baby, which is much better than all these\ntitles. May I look at it, Inkosazana?\"\n\nOf course she was delighted, and we proceeded to inspect the baby,\nwhich evidently she loved more than anything on earth. Whilst we were\nexamining the child and chatting about it, Saduko sitting by meanwhile\nin the sulks, who on earth should appear but Mameena and her fat and\nsullen-looking husband, the chief Masapo.\n\n\"Oh, Macumazahn,\" she said, appearing to notice no one else, \"how\npleased I am to see you after a whole long year!\"\n\nI stared at her and my jaw dropped. Then I recovered myself, thinking\nshe must have made a mistake and meant to say \"week.\"\n\n\"Twelve moons,\" she went on, \"and, Macumazahn, not one of them has gone\nby but I have thought of you several times and wondered if we should\never meet again. Where have you been all this while?\"\n\n\"In many places,\" I answered; \"amongst others at the Black Kloof, where\nI called upon the dwarf, Zikali, and lost my looking-glass.\"\n\n\"The Nyanga, Zikali! Oh, how often have I wished to see him. But, of\ncourse, I cannot, for I am told he will not receive any women.\"\n\n\"I don't know, I am sure,\" I replied, \"but you might try; perhaps he\nwould make an exception in your favour.\"\n\n\"I think I will, Macumazahn,\" she murmured, whereon I collapsed into\nsilence, feeling that things were getting beyond me.\n\nWhen I recovered myself a little it was to hear Mameena greeting Saduko\nwith much effusion, and complimenting him on his rise in life, which\nshe said she had always foreseen. This remark seemed to bowl out Saduko\nalso, for he made no answer to it, although I noticed that he could\nnot take his eyes off Mameena's beautiful face. Presently, however,\nhe seemed to become aware of Masapo, and instantly his whole demeanour\nchanged, for it grew proud and even terrible. Masapo tendered him some\ngreeting; whereon Saduko turned upon him and said:\n\n\"What, chief of the Amasomi, do you give the good-day to an umfokazana\nand a mangy hyena? Why do you do this? Is it because the low umfokazana\nhas become a noble and the mangy hyena has put on a tiger's coat?\" And\nhe glared at him like a veritable tiger.\n\nMasapo made no answer that I could catch. Muttering some inaudible\nwords, he turned to depart, and in doing so--quite innocently, I\nthink--struck Nandie, knocking her over on to her back and causing\nthe child to fall out of her arms in such fashion that its tender head\nstruck against a pebble with sufficient force to cause it to bleed.\n\nSaduko leapt at him, smiting him across the shoulders with the little\nstick that he carried. For a moment Masapo paused, and I thought that\nhe was going to show fight. If he had any such intention, however, he\nchanged his mind, for without a word, or showing any resentment at the\ninsult which he had received, he broke into a heavy run and vanished\namong the evening shadows. Mameena, who had observed all, broke into\nsomething else, namely, a laugh.\n\n\"Piff! My husband is big yet not brave,\" she said, \"but I do not think\nhe meant to hurt you, woman.\"\n\n\"Do you speak to me, wife of Masapo?\" asked Nandie with gentle dignity,\nas she gained her feet and picked up the stunned child. \"If so, my name\nand titles are the Inkosazana Nandie, daughter of the Black One and wife\nof the lord Saduko.\"\n\n\"Your pardon,\" replied Mameena humbly, for she was cowed at once. \"I did\nnot know who you were, Inkosazana.\"\n\n\"It is granted, wife of Masapo. Macumazahn, give me water, I pray you,\nthat I may bathe the head of my child.\"\n\nThe water was brought, and presently, when the little one seemed all\nright again, for it had only received a scratch, Nandie thanked me and\ndeparted to her own huts, saying with a smile to her husband as she\npassed that there was no need for him to accompany her, as she had\nservants waiting at the kraal gate. So Saduko stayed behind, and Mameena\nstayed also. He talked with me for quite a long while, for he had much\nto tell me, although all the time I felt that his heart was not in his\ntalk. His heart was with Mameena, who sat there and smiled continually\nin her mysterious way, only putting in a word now and again, as though\nto excuse her presence.\n\nAt length she rose and said with a sigh that she must be going back to\nwhere the Amasomi were in camp, as Masapo would need her to see to his\nfood. By now it was quite dark, although I remember that from time to\ntime the sky was lit up by sheet lightning, for a storm was brewing. As\nI expected, Saduko rose also, saying that he would see me on the morrow,\nand went away with Mameena, walking like one who dreams.\n\nA few minutes later I had occasion to leave the wagons in order to\ninspect one of the oxen which was tied up by itself at a distance,\nbecause it had shown signs of some sickness that might or might not be\ncatching. Moving quietly, as I always do from a hunter's habit, I walked\nalone to the place where the beast was tethered behind some mimosa\nthorns. Just as I reached these thorns the broad lightning shone out\nvividly, and showed me Saduko holding the unresisting shape of Mameena\nin his arms and kissing her passionately.\n\nThen I turned and went back to the wagons even more quietly than I had\ncome.\n\nI should add that on the morrow I found out that, after all, there was\nnothing serious the matter with my ox.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. THE SMELLING-OUT\n\n\nAfter these events matters went on quietly for some time. I visited\nSaduko's huts--very fine huts--about the doors of which sat quite a\nnumber of his tribesmen, who seemed glad to see me again. Here I learned\nfrom the Lady Nandie that her babe, whom she loved dearly, was none the\nworse for its little accident. Also I learned from Saduko himself, who\ncame in before I left, attended like a prince by several notable men,\nthat he had made up his quarrel with Masapo, and, indeed, apologised to\nhim, as he found that he had not really meant to insult the princess,\nhis wife, having only thrust her over by accident. Saduko added indeed\nthat now they were good friends, which was well for Masapo, a man whom\nthe King had no cause to like. I said that I was glad to hear it, and\nwent on to call upon Masapo, who received me with enthusiasm, as also\ndid Mameena.\n\nHere I noted with pleasure that this pair seemed to be on much better\nterms than I understood had been the case in the past, for Mameena even\naddressed her husband on two separate occasions in very affectionate\nlanguage, and fetched something that he wanted without waiting to be\nasked. Masapo, too, was in excellent spirits, because, as he told me,\nthe old quarrel between him and Saduko was thoroughly made up, their\nreconciliation having been sealed by an interchange of gifts. He added\nthat he was very glad that this was the case, since Saduko was now one\nof the most powerful men in the country, who could harm him much if he\nchose, especially as some secret enemy had put it about of late that he,\nMasapo, was an enemy of the King's House, and an evil-doer who practised\nwitchcraft. In proof of his new friendship, however, Saduko had promised\nthat these slanders should be looked into and their originator punished,\nif he or she could be found.\n\nWell, I congratulated him and took my departure, \"thinking furiously,\"\nas the Frenchman says. That there was a tragedy pending I was sure;\nthis weather was too calm to last; the water ran so still because it was\npreparing to leap down some hidden precipice.\n\nYet what could I do? Tell Masapo I had seen his wife being embraced by\nanother man? Surely that was not my business; it was Masapo's business\nto attend to her conduct. Also they would both deny it, and I had no\nwitness. Tell him that Saduko's reconciliation with him was not sincere,\nand that he had better look to himself? How did I know it was not\nsincere? It might suit Saduko's book to make friends with Masapo, and\nif I interfered I should only make enemies and be called a liar who was\nworking for some secret end.\n\nGo to Panda and confide my suspicions to him? He was far too anxious\nand busy about great matters to listen to me, and if he did, would only\nlaugh at this tale of a petty flirtation. No, there was nothing to be\ndone except sit still and wait. Very possibly I was mistaken, after all,\nand things would smooth themselves out, as they generally do.\n\nMeanwhile the \"reviewing,\" or whatever it may have been, was in\nprogress, and I was busy with my own affairs, making hay while the sun\nshone. So great were the crowds of people who came up to Nodwengu that\nin a week I had sold everything I had to sell in the two wagons, that\nwere mostly laden with cloth, beads, knives and so forth. Moreover, the\nprices I got were splendid, since the buyers bid against each other, and\nbefore I was cleared out I had collected quite a herd of cattle, also\na quantity of ivory. These I sent on to Natal with one of the wagons,\nremaining behind myself with the other, partly because Panda asked me\nto do so--for now and again he would seek my advice on sundry\nquestions--and partly from curiosity.\n\nThere was plenty to be curious about up at Nodwengu just then, since\nno one was sure that civil war would not break out between the princes\nCetewayo and Umbelazi, whose factions were present in force.\n\nIt was averted for the time, however, by Umbelazi keeping away from the\ngreat gathering under pretext of being sick, and leaving Saduko and some\nothers to watch his interests. Also the rival regiments were not allowed\nto approach the town at the same time. So that public cloud passed over,\nto the enormous relief of everyone, especially of Panda the King. As to\nthe private cloud whereof this history tells, it was otherwise.\n\nAs the tribes came up to the Great Place they were reviewed and sent\naway, since it was impossible to feed so vast a multitude as would have\ncollected had they all remained. Thus the Amasomi, a small people who\nwere amongst the first to arrive, soon left. Only, for some reason which\nI never quite understood, Masapo, Mameena and a few of Masapo's children\nand headmen were detained there; though perhaps, if she had chosen,\nMameena could have given an explanation.\n\nWell, things began to happen. Sundry personages were taken ill, and\nsome of them died suddenly; and soon it was noted that all these people\neither lived near to where Masapo's family was lodged or had at some\ntime or other been on bad terms with him. Thus Saduko himself was taken\nill, or said he was; at any rate, he vanished from public gaze for three\ndays, and reappeared looking very sorry for himself, though I could not\nobserve that he had lost strength or weight. These catastrophes I pass\nover, however, in order to come to the greatest of them, which is one of\nthe turning points of this chronicle.\n\nAfter recovering from his alleged sickness Saduko gave a kind of\nthanksgiving feast, at which several oxen were killed. I was present at\nthis feast, or rather at the last part of it, for I only put in what may\nbe called a complimentary appearance, having no taste for such native\ngorgings. As it drew near its close Saduko sent for Nandie, who at\nfirst refused to come as there were no women present--I think because he\nwished to show his friends that he had a princess of the royal blood\nfor his wife, who had borne him a son that one day would be great in the\nland. For Saduko, as I have said, had become a \"self-eater,\" and this\nday his pride was inflamed by the adulation of the company and by the\nbeer that he had drunk.\n\nAt length Nandie did come, carrying her babe, from which she never would\nbe parted. In her dignified, ladylike fashion (although it seems an odd\nterm to apply to a savage, I know none that describes her better) she\ngreeted first me and then sundry of the other guests, saying a few words\nto each of them. At length she came opposite to Masapo, who had dined\nnot wisely but too well, and to him, out of her natural courtesy, spoke\nrather longer than to the others, inquiring after his wife, Mameena, and\nothers. At the moment it occurred to me that she did this in order to\nassure him that she bore no malice because of the accident of a while\nbefore, and was a party to her husband's reconciliation with him.\n\nMasapo, in a hazy way, tried to reciprocate these kind intentions.\nRising to his feet, his fat, coarse body swaying to and fro because of\nthe beer that he had drunk, he expressed satisfaction at the feast that\nhad been prepared in her house. Then, his eyes falling on the child, he\nbegan to declaim about its size and beauty, until he was stopped by the\nmurmured protests of others, since among natives it is held to be not\nfortunate to praise a young child. Indeed, the person who does so is apt\nto be called an \"umtakati\", or bewitcher, who will bring evil upon its\nhead, a word that I heard murmured by several near to me. Not satisfied\nwith this serious breach of etiquette, the intoxicated Masapo snatched\nthe infant from its mother's arms under pretext of looking for the hurt\nthat had been caused to its brow when it fell to the ground at my camp,\nand finding none, proceeded to kiss it with his thick lips.\n\nNandie dragged it from him, saying:\n\n\"Would you bring death upon my son, O Chief of the Amasomi?\"\n\nThen, turning, she walked away from the feasters, upon whom there fell a\ncertain hush.\n\nFearing lest something unpleasant should ensue, for I saw Saduko biting\nhis lips with rage not unmixed with fear, and remembering Masapo's\nreputation as a wizard, I took advantage of this pause to bid a general\ngood night to the company and retire to my camp.\n\nWhat happened immediately after I left I do not know, but just before\ndawn on the following morning I was awakened from sleep in my wagon by\nmy servant Scowl, who said that a messenger had come from the huts of\nSaduko, begging that I would proceed there at once and bring the white\nman's medicines, as his child was very ill. Of course I got up and went,\ntaking with me some ipecacuanha and a few other remedies that I thought\nmight be suitable for infantile ailments.\n\nOutside the huts, which I reached just as the sun began to rise, I was\nmet by Saduko himself, who was coming to seek me, as I saw at once, in a\nstate of terrible grief.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" I asked.\n\n\"O Macumazana,\" he answered, \"that dog Masapo has bewitched my boy, and\nunless you can save him he dies.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" I said, \"why do you utter wind? If the babe is sick, it is\nfrom some natural cause.\"\n\n\"Wait till you see it,\" he replied.\n\nWell, I went into the big hut, and there found Nandie and some other\nwomen, also a native doctor or two. Nandie was seated on the floor\nlooking like a stone image of grief, for she made no sound, only pointed\nwith her finger to the infant that lay upon a mat in front of her.\n\nA single glance showed me that it was dying of some disease of which\nI had no knowledge, for its dusky little body was covered with red\nblotches and its tiny face twisted all awry. I told the women to heat\nwater, thinking that possibly this might be a case of convulsions, which\na hot bath would mitigate; but before it was ready the poor babe uttered\na thin wail and died.\n\nThen, when she saw that her child was gone, Nandie spoke for the first\ntime.\n\n\"The wizard has done his work well,\" she said, and flung herself face\ndownwards on the floor of the hut.\n\nAs I did not know what to answer, I went out, followed by Saduko.\n\n\"What has killed my son, Macumazahn?\" he asked in a hollow voice, the\ntears running down his handsome face, for he had loved his firstborn.\n\n\"I cannot tell,\" I replied; \"but had he been older I should have thought\nhe had eaten something poisonous, which seems impossible.\"\n\n\"Yes, Macumazahn, and the poison that he has eaten came from the breath\nof a wizard whom you may chance to have seen kiss him last night. Well,\nhis life shall be avenged.\"\n\n\"Saduko,\" I exclaimed, \"do not be unjust. There are many sicknesses\nthat may have killed your son of which I have no knowledge, who am not a\ntrained doctor.\"\n\n\"I will not be unjust, Macumazahn. The babe has died by witchcraft,\nlike others in this town of late, but the evil-doer may not be he whom I\nsuspect. That is for the smellers-out to decide,\" and without more words\nhe turned and left me.\n\nNext day Masapo was put upon his trial before a Court of Councillors,\nover which the King himself presided, a very unusual thing for him to\ndo, and one which showed the great interest he took in the case.\n\nAt this court I was summoned to give evidence, and, of course, confined\nmyself to answering such questions as were put to me. Practically these\nwere but two. What had passed at my wagons when Masapo had knocked over\nNandie and her child, and Saduko had struck him, and what had I seen at\nSaduko's feast when Masapo had kissed the infant? I told them in as few\nwords as I could, and after some slight cross-examination by Masapo,\nmade with a view to prove that the upsetting of Nandie was an accident\nand that he was drunk at Saduko's feast, to both of which suggestions I\nassented, I rose to go. Panda, however, stopped me and bade me describe\nthe aspect of the child when I was called in to give it medicine.\n\nI did so as accurately as possible, and could see that my account made\na deep impression on the mind of the court. Then Panda asked me if I had\never seen any similar case, to which I was obliged to reply:\n\n\"No, I have not.\"\n\nAfter this the Councillors consulted privately, and when we were called\nback the King gave his judgment, which was very brief. It was evident,\nhe said, that there had been events which might have caused enmity to\narise in the mind of Masapo against Saduko, by whom Masapo had been\nstruck with a stick. Therefore, although a reconciliation had taken\nplace, there seemed to be a possible motive for revenge. But if Masapo\nkilled the child, there was no evidence to show how he had done so.\nMoreover, that infant, his own grandson, had not died of any known\ndisease. He had, however, died of a similar disease to that which had\ncarried off certain others with whom Masapo had been mixed up, whereas\nmore, including Saduko himself, had been sick and recovered, all of\nwhich seemed to make a strong case against Masapo.\n\nStill, he and his Councillors wished not to condemn without full proof.\nThat being so, they had determined to call in the services of some\ngreat witch-doctor, one who lived at a distance and knew nothing of the\ncircumstances. Who that doctor should be was not yet settled. When\nit was and he had arrived, the case would be re-opened, and meanwhile\nMasapo would be kept a close prisoner. Finally, he prayed that the white\nman, Macumazahn, would remain at his town until the matter was settled.\n\nSo Masapo was led off, looking very dejected, and, having saluted the\nKing, we all went away.\n\nI should add that, except for the remission of the case to the court\nof the witch-doctor, which, of course, was an instance of pure Kafir\nsuperstition, this judgment of the King's seemed to me well reasoned and\njust, very different indeed from what would have been given by Dingaan\nor Chaka, who were wont, on less evidence, to make a clean sweep not\nonly of the accused, but of all his family and dependents.\n\nAbout eight days later, during which time I had heard nothing of the\nmatter and seen no one connected with it, for the whole thing seemed to\nhave become Zila--that is, not to be talked about--I received a summons\nto attend the \"smelling-out,\" and went, wondering what witch-doctor had\nbeen chosen for that bloody and barbarous ceremony. Indeed, I had not\nfar to go, since the place selected for the occasion was outside the\nfence of the town of Nodwengu, on that great open stretch of ground\nwhich lay at the mouth of the valley where I was camped. Here, as I\napproached, I saw a vast multitude of people crowded together, fifty\ndeep or more, round a little oval space not much larger than the pit\nof a theatre. On the inmost edge of this ring were seated many notable\npeople, male and female, and as I was conducted to the side of it which\nwas nearest to the gate of the town, I observed among them Saduko,\nMasapo, Mameena and others, and mixed up with them a number of soldiers,\nwho were evidently on duty.\n\nScarcely had I seated myself on a camp-stool, carried by my servant\nScowl, when through the gate of the kraal issued Panda and certain\nof his Council, whose appearance the multitude greeted with the royal\nsalute of \"Bay\u00e9te\", that came from them in a deep and simultaneous roar\nof sound. When its echoes died away, in the midst of a deep silence\nPanda spoke, saying:\n\n\"Bring forth the Nyanga [doctor]. Let the umhlahlo [that is, the\nwitch-trial] begin!\"\n\nThere was a long pause, and then in the open gateway appeared a solitary\nfigure that at first sight seemed to be scarcely human, the figure of\na dwarf with a gigantic head, from which hung long, white hair, plaited\ninto locks. It was Zikali, no other!\n\nQuite unattended, and naked save for his moocha, for he had on him none\nof the ordinary paraphernalia of the witch-doctor, he waddled forward\nwith a curious toad-like gait till he had passed through the Councillors\nand stood in the open space of the ring. Halting there, he looked about\nhim slowly with his deep-set eyes, turning as he looked, till at length\nhis glance fell upon the King.\n\n\"What would you have of me, Son of Senzangakona?\" he asked. \"Many years\nhave passed since last we met. Why do you drag me from my hut, I who\nhave visited the kraal of the King of the Zulus but twice since the\n'Black One' [Chaka] sat upon the throne--once when the Boers were killed\nby him who went before you, and once when I was brought forth to see\nall who were left of my race, shoots of the royal Dwandwe stock, slain\nbefore my eyes. Do you bear me hither that I may follow them into the\ndarkness, O Child of Senzangakona? If so I am ready; only then I have\nwords to say that it may not please you to hear.\"\n\nHis deep, rumbling voice echoed into silence, while the great audience\nwaited for the King's answer. I could see that they were all afraid of\nthis man, yes, even Panda was afraid, for he shifted uneasily upon his\nstool. At length he spoke, saying:\n\n\"Not so, O Zikali. Who would wish to do hurt to the wisest and most\nancient man in all the land, to him who touches the far past with one\nhand and the present with the other, to him who was old before our\ngrandfathers began to be? Nay, you are safe, you on whom not even the\n'Black One' dared to lay a finger, although you were his enemy and he\nhated you. As for the reason why you have been brought here, tell it\nto us, O Zikali. Who are we that we should instruct you in the ways of\nwisdom?\"\n\nWhen the dwarf heard this he broke into one of his great laughs.\n\n\"So at last the House of Senzangakona acknowledges that I have wisdom.\nThen before all is done they will think me wise indeed.\"\n\nHe laughed again in his ill-omened fashion and went on hurriedly, as\nthough he feared that he should be called upon to explain his words:\n\n\"Where is the fee? Where is the fee? Is the King so poor that he expects\nan old Dwandwe doctor to divine for nothing, just as though he were\nworking for a private friend?\"\n\nPanda made a motion with his hand, and ten fine heifers were driven into\nthe circle from some place where they had been kept in waiting.\n\n\"Sorry beasts!\" said Zikali contemptuously, \"compared to those we used\nto breed before the time of Senzangakona\"--a remark which caused a loud\n\"Wow!\" of astonishment to be uttered by the multitude that heard it.\n\"Still, such as they are, let them be taken to my kraal, with a bull,\nfor I have none.\"\n\nThe cattle were driven away, and the ancient dwarf squatted himself down\nand stared at the ground, looking like a great black toad. For a long\nwhile--quite ten minutes, I should think--he stared thus, till I, for\none, watching him intently, began to feel as though I were mesmerised.\n\nAt length he looked up, tossing back his grey locks, and said:\n\n\"I see many things in the dust. Oh, yes, it is alive, it is alive, and\ntells me many things. Show that you are alive, O Dust. Look!\"\n\nAs he spoke, throwing his hands upwards, there arose at his very feet\none of those tiny and incomprehensible whirlwinds with which all who\nknow South Africa will be familiar. It drove the dust together; it\nlifted it in a tall, spiral column that rose and rose to a height of\nfifty feet or more. Then it died away as suddenly as it had come, so\nthat the dust fell down again over Zikali, over the King, and over three\nof his sons who sat behind him. Those three sons, I remember, were named\nTshonkweni, Dabulesinye, and Mantantashiya. As it chanced, by a strange\ncoincidence all of these were killed at the great battle of the Tugela\nof which I have to tell.\n\nNow again an exclamation of fear and wonder rose from the audience, who\nset down this lifting of the dust at Zikali's very feet not to natural\ncauses, but to the power of his magic. Moreover, those on whom it had\nfallen, including the King, rose hurriedly and shook and brushed it\nfrom their persons with a zeal that was not, I think, inspired by a mere\ndesire for cleanliness. But Zikali only laughed again in his terrible\nfashion and let it lie on his fresh-oiled body, which it turned to the\ndull, dead hue of a grey adder.\n\nHe rose and, stepping here and there, examined the new-fallen dust. Then\nhe put his hand into a pouch he wore and produced from it a dried human\nfinger, whereof the nail was so pink that I think it must have been\ncoloured--a sight at which the circle shuddered.\n\n\"Be clever,\" he said, \"O Finger of her I loved best; be clever and write\nin the dust as yonder Macumazana can write, and as some of the Dwandwe\nused to write before we became slaves and bowed ourselves down before\nthe Great Heavens.\" (By this he meant the Zulus, whose name means\nthe Heavens.) \"Be clever, dear Finger which caressed me once, me, the\n'Thing-that-should-not-have-been-born,' as more will think before I die,\nand write those matters that it pleases the House of Senzangakona to\nknow this day.\"\n\nThen he bent down, and with the dead finger at three separate spots made\ncertain markings in the fallen dust, which to me seemed to consist of\ncircles and dots; and a strange and horrid sight it was to see him do\nit.\n\n\"I thank you, dear Finger. Now sleep, sleep, your work is done,\" and\nslowly he wrapped the relic up in some soft material and restored it to\nhis pouch.\n\nThen he studied the first of the markings and asked: \"What am I here\nfor? What am I here for? Does he who sits upon the Throne desire to know\nhow long he has to reign?\"\n\nNow, those of the inner circle of the spectators, who at these\n\"smellings-out\" act as a kind of chorus, looked at the King, and, seeing\nthat he shook his head vigorously, stretched out their right hands,\nholding the thumb downwards, and said simultaneously in a cold, low\nvoice:\n\n\"Izwa!\" (That is, \"We hear you.\")\n\nZikali stamped upon this set of markings.\n\n\"It is well,\" he said. \"He who sits upon the Throne does not desire to\nknow how long he has to reign, and therefore the dust has forgotten and\nshows it not to me.\"\n\nThen he walked to the next markings and studied them.\n\n\"Does the Child of Senzangakona desire to know which of his sons shall\nlive and which shall die; aye, and which of them shall sleep in his hut\nwhen he is gone?\"\n\nNow a great roar of \"Izwa!\" accompanied by the clapping of hands, rose\nfrom all the outer multitude who heard, for there was no information\nthat the Zulu people desired so earnestly as this at the time of which I\nwrite.\n\nBut again Panda, who, I saw, was thoroughly alarmed at the turn things\nwere taking, shook his head vigorously, whereon the obedient chorus\nnegatived the question in the same fashion as before.\n\nZikali stamped upon the second set of markings, saying:\n\n\"The people desire to know, but the Great Ones are afraid to learn, and\ntherefore the dust has forgotten who in the days to come shall sleep in\nthe hut of the King and who shall sleep in the bellies of the jackals\nand the crops of the vultures after they have 'gone beyond' by the\nbridge of spears.\"\n\nNow, at this awful speech (which, both because of all that it implied of\nbloodshed and civil war and of the wild, wailing voice in which it was\nspoken, that seemed quite different from Zikali's, caused everyone who\nheard it, including myself, I am afraid, to gasp and shiver) the King\nsprang from his stool as though to put a stop to such doctoring. Then,\nafter his fashion, he changed his mind and sat down again. But Zikali,\ntaking no heed, went to the third set of marks and studied them.\n\n\"It would seem,\" he said, \"that I am awakened from sleep in my Black\nHouse yonder to tell of a very little matter, that might well have been\ndealt with by any common Nyanga born but yesterday. Well, I have taken\nmy fee, and I will earn it, although I thought that I was brought here\nto speak of great matters, such as the death of princes and the fortunes\nof peoples. Is it desired that my Spirit should speak of wizardries in\nthis town of Nodwengu?\"\n\n\"Izwa!\" said the chorus in a loud voice.\n\nZikali nodded his great head and seemed to talk with the dust, waiting\nnow and again for an answer.\n\n\"Good,\" he said; \"they are many, and the dust has told them all to me.\nOh, they are very many\"--and he glared around him--\"so many that if I\nspoke them all the hyenas of the hills would be full to-night--\"\n\nHere the audience began to show signs of great apprehension.\n\n\"But,\" looking down at the dust and turning his head sideways, \"what\ndo you say, what do you say? Speak more plainly, Little Voices, for you\nknow I grow deaf. Oh! now I understand. The matter is even smaller than\nI thought. Just of one wizard--\"\n\n\"Izwa!\" (loudly).\n\n\"--just of a few deaths and some sicknesses.\"\n\n\"Izwa!\"\n\n\"Just of one death, one principal death.\"\n\n\"Izwa!\" (very loudly).\n\n\"Ah! So we have it--one death. Now, was it a man?\"\n\n\"Izwa!\" (very coldly).\n\n\"A woman?\"\n\n\"Izwa!\" (still more coldly).\n\n\"Then a child? It must be a child, unless indeed it is the death of a\nspirit. But what do you people know of spirits? A child! A child! Ah!\nyou hear me--a child. A male child, I think. Do you not say so, O Dust?\"\n\n\"Izwa!\" (emphatically).\n\n\"A common child? A bastard? The son of nobody?\"\n\n\"Izwa!\" (very low).\n\n\"A well-born child? One who would have been great? O Dust, I hear, I\nhear; a royal child, a child in whom ran the blood of the Father of the\nZulus, he who was my friend? The blood of Senzangakona, the blood of the\n'Black One,' the blood of Panda.\"\n\nHe stopped, while both from the chorus and from the thousands of the\ncircle gathered around went up one roar of \"Izwa!\" emphasised by a\nmighty movement of outstretched arms and down-pointing thumbs.\n\nThen silence, during which Zikali stamped upon all the remaining\nmarkings, saying:\n\n\"I thank you, O Dust, though I am sorry to have troubled you for so\nsmall a matter. So, so,\" he went on presently, \"a royal boy-child\nis dead, and you think by witchcraft. Let us find out if he died by\nwitchcraft or as others die, by command of the Heavens that need them.\nWhat! Here is one mark which I have left. Look! It grows red, it is full\nof spots! The child died with a twisted face.\"\n\n\"Izwa! Izwa! Izwa!\" (crescendo).\n\n\"This death was not natural. Now, was it witchcraft or was it poison?\nBoth, I think, both. And whose was the child? Not that of a son of the\nKing, I think. Oh, yes, you hear me, People, you hear me; but be silent;\nI do not need your help. No, not of a son; of a daughter, then.\" He\nturned and, looked about him till his eye fell upon a group of women,\namongst whom sat Nandie, dressed like a common person. \"Of a daughter,\na daughter--\" He walked to the group of women. \"Why, none of these are\nroyal; they are the children of low people. And yet--and yet I seem to\nsmell the blood of Senzangakona.\"\n\nHe sniffed at the air as a dog does, and as he sniffed drew ever nearer\nto Nandie, till at last he laughed and pointed to her.\n\n\"_Your_ child, Princess, whose name I do not know. Your firstborn child,\nwhom you loved more than your own heart.\"\n\nShe rose.\n\n\"Yes, yes, Nyanga,\" she cried. \"I am the Princess Nandie, and he was my\nchild, whom I loved more than my own heart.\"\n\n\"Haha!\" said Zikali. \"Dust, you did not lie to me. My Spirit, you did\nnot lie to me. But now, tell me, Dust--and tell me, my Spirit--who\nkilled this child?\"\n\nHe began to waddle round the circle, an extraordinary sight, covered\nas he was with grey grime, varied with streaks of black skin where the\nperspiration had washed the dust away.\n\nPresently he came opposite to me, and, to my dismay, paused, sniffing at\nme as he had at Nandie.\n\n\"Ah! ah! O Macumazana,\" he said, \"you have something to do with this\nmatter,\" a saying at which all that audience pricked their ears.\n\nThen I rose up in wrath and fear, knowing my position to be one of some\ndanger.\n\n\"Wizard, or Smeller-out of Wizards, whichever you name yourself,\" I\ncalled in a loud voice, \"if you mean that _I_ killed Nandie's child, you\nlie!\"\n\n\"No, no, Macumazahn,\" he answered, \"but you tried to save it, and\ntherefore you had something to do with the matter, had you not?\nMoreover, I think that you, who are wise like me, know who did kill it.\nWon't you tell me, Macumazahn? No? Then I must find out for myself. Be\nat peace. Does not all the land know that your hands are white as your\nheart?\"\n\nThen, to my great relief, he passed on, amidst a murmur of approbation,\nfor, as I have said, the Zulus liked me. Round and round he wandered,\nto my surprise passing both Mameena and Masapo without taking any\nparticular note of them, although he scanned them both, and I thought\nthat I saw a swift glance of recognition pass between him and Mameena.\nIt was curious to watch his progress, for as he went those in front of\nhim swayed in their terror like corn before a puff of wind, and when he\nhad passed they straightened themselves as the corn does when the wind\nhas gone by.\n\nAt length he had finished his journey and returned to his\nstarting-point, to all appearance completely puzzled.\n\n\"You keep so many wizards at your kraal, King,\" he said, addressing\nPanda, \"that it is hard to say which of them wrought this deed. It would\nhave been easier to tell you of greater matters. Yet I have taken your\nfee, and I must earn it--I must earn it. Dust, you are dumb. Now, my\nIdhlozi, my Spirit, do you speak?\" and, holding his head sideways,\nhe turned his left ear up towards the sky, then said presently, in a\ncurious, matter-of-fact voice:\n\n\"Ah! I thank you, Spirit. Well, King, your grandchild was killed by the\nHouse of Masapo, your enemy, chief of the Amasomi.\"\n\nNow a roar of approbation went up from the audience, among whom Masapo's\nguilt was a foregone conclusion.\n\nWhen this had died down Panda spoke, saying:\n\n\"The House of Masapo is a large house; I believe that he has several\nwives and many children. It is not enough to smell out the House, since\nI am not as those who went before me were, nor will I slay the innocent\nwith the guilty. Tell us, O Opener-of-Roads, who among the House of\nMasapo has wrought this deed?\"\n\n\"That's just the question,\" grumbled Zikali in a deep voice. \"All that\nI know is that it was done by poisoning, and I smell the poison. It is\nhere.\"\n\nThen he walked to where Mameena sat and cried out:\n\n\"Seize that woman and search her hair.\"\n\nExecutioners who were in waiting sprang forward, but Mameena waved them\naway.\n\n\"Friends,\" she said, with a little laugh, \"there is no need to touch\nme,\" and, rising, she stepped forward to the centre of the ring. Here,\nwith a few swift motions of her hands, she flung off first the cloak she\nwore, then the moocha about her middle, and lastly the fillet that bound\nher long hair, and stood before that audience in all her naked beauty--a\nwondrous and a lovely sight.\n\n\"Now,\" she said, \"let women come and search me and my garments, and see\nif there is any poison hid there.\"\n\nTwo old crones stepped forward--though I do not know who sent them--and\ncarried out a very thorough examination, finally reporting that they had\nfound nothing. Thereon Mameena, with a shrug of her shoulders, resumed\nsuch clothes as she wore, and returned to her place.\n\nZikali appeared to grow angry. He stamped upon the ground with his big\nfeet; he shook his braided grey locks and cried out:\n\n\"Is my wisdom to be defeated in such a little matter? One of you tie a\nbandage over my eyes.\"\n\nNow a man--it was Maputa, the messenger--came out and did so, and I\nnoted that he tied it well and tight. Zikali whirled round upon his\nheels, first one way and then another, and, crying aloud: \"Guide me, my\nSpirit!\" marched forward in a zigzag fashion, as a blindfolded man does,\nwith his arms stretched out in front of him. First he went to the right,\nthen to the left, and then straight forward, till at length, to my\nastonishment, he came exactly opposite the spot where Masapo sat and,\nstretching out his great, groping hands, seized the kaross with which he\nwas covered and, with a jerk, tore it from him.\n\n\"Search this!\" he cried, throwing it on the ground, and a woman\nsearched.\n\nPresently she uttered an exclamation, and from among the fur of one of\nthe tails of the kaross produced a tiny bag that appeared to be made out\nof the bladder of a fish. This she handed to Zikali, whose eyes had now\nbeen unbandaged.\n\nHe looked at it, then gave it to Maputa, saying:\n\n\"There is the poison--there is the poison, but who gave it I do not say.\nI am weary. Let me go.\"\n\nThen, none hindering him, he walked away through the gate of the kraal.\n\nSoldiers seized upon Masapo, while the multitude roared: \"Kill the\nwizard!\"\n\nMasapo sprang up, and, running to where the King sat, flung himself upon\nhis knees, protesting his innocence and praying for mercy. I also, who\nhad doubts as to all this business, ventured to rise and speak.\n\n\"O King,\" I said, \"as one who has known this man in the past, I plead\nwith you. How that powder came into his kaross I know not, but perchance\nit is not poison, only harmless dust.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is but wood dust which I use for the cleaning of my nails,\"\ncried Masapo, for he was so terrified I think he knew not what he said.\n\n\"So you own to knowledge of the medicine?\" exclaimed Panda. \"Therefore\nnone hid it in your kaross through malice.\"\n\nMasapo began to explain, but what he said was lost in a mighty roar of\n\"Kill the wizard!\"\n\nPanda held up his hand and there was silence.\n\n\"Bring milk in a dish,\" commanded the King, and it, was brought, and, at\na further word from him, dusted with the powder.\n\n\"Now, O Macumazana,\" said Panda to me, \"if you still think that yonder\nman is innocent, will you drink this milk?\"\n\n\"I do not like milk, O King,\" I answered, shaking my head, whereon all\nwho heard me laughed.\n\n\"Will Mameena, his wife, drink it, then?\" asked Panda.\n\nShe also shook her head, saying:\n\n\"O King, I drink no milk that is mixed with dust.\"\n\nJust then a lean, white dog, one of those homeless, mangy beasts that\nstray about kraals and live upon carrion, wandered into the ring. Panda\nmade a sign, and a servant, going to where the poor beast stood staring\nabout it hungrily, set down the wooden dish of milk in front of it.\nInstantly the dog lapped it up, for it was starving, and as it finished\nthe last drop the man slipped a leathern thong about its neck and held\nit fast.\n\nNow all eyes were fixed upon the dog, mine among them. Presently the\nbeast uttered a long and melancholy howl which thrilled me through, for\nI knew it to be Masapo's death warrant, then began to scratch the ground\nand foam at the mouth. Guessing what would follow, I rose, bowed to the\nKing, and walked away to my camp, which, it will be remembered, was set\nup in a little kloof commanding this place, at a distance only of a few\nhundred yards. So intent was all the multitude upon watching the dog\nthat I doubt whether anyone saw me go. As for that poor beast, Scowl,\nwho stayed behind, told me that it did not die for about ten minutes,\nsince before its end a red rash appeared upon it similar to that which I\nhad seen upon Saduko's child, and it was seized with convulsions.\n\nWell, I reached my tent unmolested, and, having lit my pipe, engaged\nmyself in making business entries in my note-book, in order to divert my\nmind as much as I could, when suddenly I heard a most devilish clamour.\nLooking up, I saw Masapo running towards me with a speed that I should\nhave thought impossible in so fat a man, while after him raced the\nfierce-faced executioners, and behind came the mob.\n\n\"Kill the evil-doer!\" they shouted.\n\nMasapo reached me. He flung himself on his knees before me, gasping:\n\n\"Save me, Macumazahn! I am innocent. Mameena, the witch! Mameena--\"\n\nHe got no farther, for the slayers had leapt on him like hounds upon a\nbuck and dragged him from me.\n\nThen I turned and covered up my eyes.\n\n\nNext morning I left Nodwengu without saying good-bye to anyone, for what\nhad happened there made me desire a change. My servant, Scowl, and one\nof my hunters remained, however, to collect some cattle that were still\ndue to me.\n\nA month or more later, when they joined me in Natal, bringing the\ncattle, they told me that Mameena, the widow of Masapo, had entered the\nhouse of Saduko as his second wife. In answer to a question which I put\nto them, they added that it was said that the Princess Nandie did\nnot approve of this choice of Saduko, which she thought would not be\nfortunate for him or bring him happiness. As her husband seemed to be\nmuch enamoured of Mameena, however, she had waived her objections, and\nwhen Panda asked if she gave her consent had told him that, although she\nwould prefer that Saduko should choose some other woman who had not been\nmixed up with the wizard who killed her child, she was prepared to take\nMameena as her sister, and would know how to keep her in her place.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. THE SIN OF UMBELAZI\n\n\nAbout eighteen months had gone by, and once again, in the autumn of the\nyear 1856, I found myself at old Umbezi's kraal, where there seemed to\nbe an extraordinary market for any kind of gas-pipe that could be called\na gun. Well, as a trader who could not afford to neglect profitable\nmarkets, which are hard things to find, there I was.\n\nNow, in eighteen months many things become a little obscured in one's\nmemory, especially if they have to do with savages, in whom, after all,\none takes only a philosophical and a business interest. Therefore I may\nperhaps be excused if I had more or less forgotten a good many of the\ndetails of what I may call the Mameena affair. These, however, came back\nto me very vividly when the first person that I met--at some distance\nfrom the kraal, where I suppose she had been taking a country walk--was\nthe beautiful Mameena herself. There she was, looking quite unchanged\nand as lovely as ever, sitting under the shade of a wild fig-tree and\nfanning herself with a handful of its leaves.\n\nOf course I jumped off my wagon-box and greeted her.\n\n\"Siyakubona [that is, good morrow], Macumazahn,\" she said. \"My heart is\nglad to see you.\"\n\n\"Siyakubona, Mameena,\" I answered, leaving out all reference to _my_\nheart. Then I added, looking at her: \"Is it true that you have a new\nhusband?\"\n\n\"Yes, Macumazahn, an old lover of mine has become a new husband. You\nknow whom I mean--Saduko. After the death of that evil-doer, Masapo, he\ngrew very urgent, and the King, also the Inkosazana Nandie, pressed it\non me, and so I yielded. Also, to be honest, Saduko was a good match, or\nseemed to be so.\"\n\nBy now we were walking side by side, for the train of wagons had gone\nahead to the old outspan. So I stopped and looked her in the face.\n\n\"'Seemed to be,'\" I repeated. \"What do you mean by 'seemed to be'? Are\nyou not happy this time?\"\n\n\"Not altogether, Macumazahn,\" she answered, with a shrug of her\nshoulders. \"Saduko is very fond of me--fonder than I like indeed, since\nit causes him to neglect Nandie, who, by the way, has another son, and,\nalthough she says little, that makes Nandie cross. In short,\" she added,\nwith a burst of truth, \"I am the plaything, Nandie is the great lady,\nand that place suits me ill.\"\n\n\"If you love Saduko, you should not mind, Mameena.\"\n\n\"Love,\" she said bitterly. \"Piff! What is love? But I have asked you\nthat question once before.\"\n\n\"Why are you here, Mameena?\" I inquired, leaving it unanswered.\n\n\"Because Saduko is here, and, of course, Nandie, for she never leaves\nhim, and he will not leave me; because the Prince Umbelazi is coming;\nbecause there are plots afoot and the great war draws near--that war in\nwhich so many must die.\"\n\n\"Between Cetewayo and Umbelazi, Mameena?\"\n\n\"Aye, between Cetewayo and Umbelazi. Why do you suppose those wagons of\nyours are loaded with guns for which so many cattle must be paid? Not to\nshoot game with, I think. Well, this little kraal of my father's is\njust now the headquarters of the Umbelazi faction, the Isigqosa, as the\nprincedom of Gikazi is that of Cetewayo. My poor father!\" she added,\nwith her characteristic shrug, \"he thinks himself very great to-day,\nas he did after he had shot the elephant--before I nursed you,\nMacumazahn--but often I wonder what will be the end of it--for him and\nfor all of us, Macumazahn, including yourself.\"\n\n\"I!\" I answered. \"What have I to do with your Zulu quarrels?\"\n\n\"That you will know when you have done with them, Macumazahn. But here\nis the kraal, and before we enter it I wish to thank you for trying to\nprotect that unlucky husband of mine, Masapo.\"\n\n\"I only did so, Mameena, because I thought him innocent.\"\n\n\"I know, Macumazahn; and so did I, although, as I always told you, I\nhated him, the man with whom my father forced me to marry. But I am\nafraid, from what I have learned since, that he was not altogether\ninnocent. You see, Saduko had struck him, which he could not forget.\nAlso, he was jealous of Saduko, who had been my suitor, and wished to\ninjure him. But what I do not understand,\" she added, with a burst of\nconfidence, \"is why he did not kill Saduko instead of his child.\"\n\n\"Well, Mameena, you may remember it was said he tried to do so.\"\n\n\"Yes, Macumazahn; I had forgotten that. I suppose that he did try, and\nfailed. Oh, now I see things with both eyes. Look, yonder is my father.\nI will go away. But come and talk to me sometimes, Macumazahn, for\notherwise Nandie will be careful that I should hear nothing--I who am\nthe plaything, the beautiful woman of the House, who must sit and smile,\nbut must not think.\"\n\nSo she departed, and I went on to meet old Umbezi, who came gambolling\ntowards me like an obese goat, reflecting that, whatever might be the\ntruth or otherwise of her story, her advancement in the world did not\nseem to have brought Mameena greater happiness and contentment.\n\nUmbezi, who greeted me warmly, was in high spirits and full of\nimportance. He informed me that the marriage of Mameena to Saduko, after\nthe death of the wizard, her husband, whose tribe and cattle had been\ngiven to Saduko in compensation for the loss of his son, was a most\nfortunate thing for him.\n\nI asked why.\n\n\"Because as Saduko grows great so I, his father-in-law, grow great with\nhim, Macumazahn, especially as he has been liberal to me in the matter\nof cattle, passing on to me a share of the herds of Masapo, so that I,\nwho have been poor so long, am getting rich at last. Moreover, my kraal\nis to be honoured with a visit from Umbelazi and some of his brothers\nto-morrow, and Saduko has promised to lift me up high when the Prince is\ndeclared heir to the throne.\"\n\n\"Which prince?\" I asked.\n\n\"Umbelazi, Macumazahn. Who else? Umbelazi, who without doubt will\nconquer Cetewayo.\"\n\n\"Why without doubt, Umbezi? Cetewayo has a great following, and if _he_\nshould conquer I think that you will only be lifted up in the crops of\nthe vultures.\"\n\nAt this rough suggestion Umbezi's fat face fell.\n\n\"O Macumazana,\" he said, \"if I thought that, I would go over to\nCetewayo, although Saduko is my son-in-law. But it is not possible,\nsince the King loves Umbelazi's mother most of all his wives, and, as I\nchance to know, has sworn to her that he favours Umbelazi's cause, since\nhe is the dearest to him of all his sons, and will do everything that\nhe can to help him, even to the sending of his own regiment to his\nassistance, if there should be need. Also, it is said that Zikali,\nOpener-of-Roads, who has all wisdom, has prophesied that Umbelazi will\nwin more than he ever hoped for.\"\n\n\"The King!\" I said, \"a straw blown hither and thither between two great\nwinds, waiting to be wafted to rest by that which is strongest! The\nprophecy of Zikali! It seems to me that it can be read two ways, if,\nindeed, he ever made one. Well, Umbezi, I hope that you are right, for,\nalthough it is no affair of mine, who am but a white trader in your\ncountry, I like Umbelazi better than Cetewayo, and think that he has a\nkinder heart. Also, as you have chosen his side, I advise you to stick\nto it, since traitors to a cause seldom come to any good, whether it\nwins or loses. And now, will you take count of the guns and powder which\nI have brought with me?\"\n\nAh! better would it have been for Umbezi if he had listened to my advice\nand remained faithful to the leader he had chosen, for then, even if he\nhad lost his life, at least he would have kept his good name. But of him\npresently, as they say in pedigrees.\n\nNext day I went to pay my respects to Nandie, whom I found engaged in\nnursing her new baby and as quiet and stately in her demeanour as ever.\nStill, I think that she was very glad to see me, because I had tried to\nsave the life of her first child, whom she could not forget, if for no\nother reason. Whilst I was talking to her of that sad matter, also of\nthe political state of the country, as to which I think she wished to\nsay something to me, Mameena entered the hut, without waiting to be\nasked, and sat down, whereon Nandie became suddenly silent.\n\nThis, however, did not trouble Mameena, who talked away about anything\nand everything, completely ignoring the head-wife. For a while Nandie\nbore it with patience, but at length she took advantage of a pause in\nthe conversation to say in her firm, low voice:\n\n\"This is my hut, daughter of Umbezi, a thing which you remember well\nenough when it is a question whether Saduko, our husband, shall visit\nyou or me. Can you not remember it now when I would speak with the white\nchief, Watcher-by-Night, who has been so good as to take the trouble to\ncome to see me?\"\n\nOn hearing these words Mameena leapt up in a rage, and I must say I\nnever saw her look more lovely.\n\n\"You insult me, daughter of Panda, as you always try to do, because you\nare jealous of me.\"\n\n\"Your pardon, sister,\" replied Nandie. \"Why should I, who am Saduko's\nInkosikazi, and, as you say, daughter of Panda, the King, be jealous\nof the widow of the wizard, Masapo, and the daughter of the headman,\nUmbezi, whom it has pleased our husband to take into his house to be the\ncompanion of his leisure?\"\n\n\"Why? Because you know that Saduko loves my little finger more than\nhe does your whole body, although you are of the King's blood and have\nborne him brats,\" she answered, looking at the infant with no kindly\neye.\n\n\"It may be so, daughter of Umbezi, for men have their fancies, and\nwithout doubt you are fair. Yet I would ask you one thing--if Saduko\nloves you so much, how comes it he trusts you so little that you must\nlearn any matter of weight by listening at my door, as I found you doing\nthe other day?\"\n\n\"Because you teach him not to do so, O Nandie. Because you are ever\ntelling him not to consult with me, since she who has betrayed one\nhusband may betray another. Because you make him believe my place is\nthat of his toy, not that of his companion, and this although I am\ncleverer than you and all your House tied into one bundle, as you may\nfind out some day.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Nandie, quite undisturbed, \"I do teach him these things,\nand I am glad that in this matter Saduko has a thinking head and listens\nto me. Also I agree that it is likely I shall learn many more ill things\nthrough and of you one day, daughter of Umbezi. And now, as it is not\ngood that we should wrangle before this white lord, again I say to you\nthat this is my hut, in which I wish to speak alone with my guest.\"\n\n\"I go, I go!\" gasped Mameena; \"but I tell you that Saduko shall hear of\nthis.\"\n\n\"Certainly he will hear of it, for I shall tell him when he comes\nto-night.\"\n\nAnother instant and Mameena was gone, having shot out of the hut like a\nrabbit from its burrow.\n\n\"I ask your pardon, Macumazahn, for what has happened,\" said Nandie,\n\"but it had become necessary that I should teach my sister, Mameena,\nupon which stool she ought to sit. I do not trust her, Macumazahn. I\nthink that she knows more of the death of my child than she chooses to\nsay, she who wished to be rid of Masapo for a reason you can guess. I\nthink also she will bring shame and trouble upon Saduko, whom she\nhas bewitched with her beauty, as she bewitches all men--perhaps even\nyourself a little, Macumazahn. And now let us talk of other matters.\"\n\nTo this proposition I agreed cordially, since, to tell the truth, if I\ncould have managed to do so with any decent grace, I should have been\nout of that hut long before Mameena. So we fell to conversing on the\ncondition of Zululand and the dangers that lay ahead for all who were\nconnected with the royal House--a state of affairs which troubled Nandie\nmuch, for she was a clear-headed woman, and one who feared the future.\n\n\"Ah! Macumazahn,\" she said to me as we parted, \"I would that I were the\nwife of some man who did not desire to grow great, and that no royal\nblood ran in my veins.\"\n\nOn the next day the Prince Umbelazi arrived, and with him Saduko and\na few other notable men. They came quite quietly and without any\nostensible escort, although Scowl, my servant, told me he heard that\nthe bush at a little distance was swarming with soldiers of the Isigqosa\nparty. If I remember rightly, the excuse for the visit was that Umbezi\nhad some of a certain rare breed of white cattle whereof the prince\nwished to secure young bulls and heifers to improve his herd.\n\nOnce inside the kraal, however, Umbelazi, who was a very open-natured\nman, threw off all pretence, and, after greeting me heartily enough,\ntold me with plainness that he was there because this was a convenient\nspot on which to arrange the consolidation of his party.\n\nAlmost every hour during the next two weeks messengers--many of whom\nwere chiefs disguised--came and went. I should have liked to follow\ntheir example--that is, so far as their departure was concerned--for\nI felt that I was being drawn into a very dangerous vortex. But, as\na matter of fact, I could not escape, since I was obliged to wait to\nreceive payment for my stuff, which, as usual, was made in cattle.\n\nUmbelazi talked with me a good deal at that time, impressing upon me how\nfriendly he was towards the English white men of Natal, as distinguished\nfrom the Boers, and what good treatment he was prepared to promise to\nthem, should he ever attain to authority in Zululand. It was during one\nof the earliest of these conversations, which, of course, I saw had an\nultimate object, that he met Mameena, I think, for the first time.\n\nWe were walking together in a little natural glade of the bush that\nbordered one side of the kraal, when, at the end of it, looking like\nsome wood nymph of classic fable in the light of the setting sun,\nappeared the lovely Mameena, clothed only in her girdle of fur, her\nnecklace of blue beads and some copper ornaments, and carrying upon her\nhead a gourd.\n\nUmbelazi noted her at once, and, ceasing his political talk, of which he\nwas obviously tired, asked me who that beautiful intombi (that is, girl)\nmight be.\n\n\"She is not an intombi, Prince,\" I answered. \"She is a widow who is\nagain a wife, the second wife of your friend and councillor, Saduko, and\nthe daughter of your host, Umbezi.\"\n\n\"Is it so, Macumazahn? Oh, then I have heard of her, though, as it\nchances, I have never met her before. No wonder that my sister Nandie is\njealous, for she is beautiful indeed.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered, \"she looks pretty against the red sky, does she not?\"\n\nBy now we were drawing near to Mameena, and I greeted her, asking if she\nwanted anything.\n\n\"Nothing, Macumazahn,\" she answered in her delicate, modest way, for\nnever did I know anyone who could seem quite so modest as Mameena, and\nwith a swift glance of her shy eyes at the tall and splendid Umbelazi,\n\"nothing. Only,\" she added, \"I was passing with the milk of one of the\nfew cows my father gave me, and saw you, and I thought that perhaps, as\nthe day has been so hot, you might like a drink of it.\"\n\nThen, lifting the gourd from her head, she held it out to me.\n\nI thanked her, drank some--who could do less?--and returned it to her,\nwhereon she made as though she would hasten to depart.\n\n\"May I not drink also, daughter of Umbezi?\" asked Umbelazi, who could\nscarcely take his eyes off her.\n\n\"Certainly, sir, if you are a friend of Macumazahn,\" she replied,\nhanding him the gourd.\n\n\"I am that, Lady, and more than that, since I am a friend of your\nhusband, Saduko, also, as you will know when I tell you that my name is\nUmbelazi.\"\n\n\"I thought it must be so,\" she replied, \"because of your--of your\nstature. Let the Prince accept the offering of his servant, who one day\nhopes to be his subject,\" and, dropping upon her knee, she held out the\ngourd to him. Over it I saw their eyes meet. He drank, and as he handed\nback the vessel she said:\n\n\"O Prince, may I be granted a word with you? I have that to tell which\nyou would perhaps do well to hear, since news sometimes reaches the ears\nof humble women that escapes those of the men, our masters.\"\n\nHe bowed his head in assent, whereon, taking a hint which Mameena gave\nme with her eyes, I muttered something about business and made myself\nscarce. I may add that Mameena must have had a great deal to tell\nUmbelazi. Fully an hour and a half had gone by before, by the light of\nthe moon, from a point of vantage on my wagon-box, whence, according to\nmy custom, I was keeping a lookout on things in general, I saw her slip\nback to the kraal silently as a snake, followed at a little distance by\nthe towering form of Umbelazi.\n\nApparently Mameena continued to be the recipient of information which\nshe found it necessary to communicate in private to the prince. At any\nrate, on sundry subsequent evenings the dullness of my vigil on the\nwagon-box was relieved by the sight of her graceful figure gliding home\nfrom the kloof that Umbelazi seemed to find a very suitable spot\nfor reflection after sunset. On one of the last of these occasions I\nremember that Nandie chanced to be with me, having come to my wagon for\nsome medicine for her baby.\n\n\"What does it mean, Macumazahn?\" she asked, when the pair had gone by,\nas they thought unobserved, since we were standing where they could not\nsee us.\n\n\"I don't know, and I don't want to know,\" I answered sharply.\n\n\"Neither do I, Macumazahn; but without doubt we shall learn in time. If\nthe crocodile is patient and silent the buck always drops into its jaws\nat last.\"\n\nOn the day after Nandie made this wise remark Saduko started on a\nmission, as I understood, to win over several doubtful chiefs to the\ncause of Indhlovu-ene-sihlonti (the Elephant-with-the-tuft-of-hair), as\nthe Prince Umbelazi was called among the Zulus, though not to his face.\nThis mission lasted ten days, and before it was concluded an important\nevent happened at Umbezi's kraal.\n\nOne evening Mameena came to me in a great rage, and said that she could\nbear her present life no longer. Presuming on her rank and position as\nhead-wife, Nandie treated her like a servant--nay, like a little dog, to\nbe beaten with a stick. She wished that Nandie would die.\n\n\"It will be very unlucky for you if she does,\" I answered, \"for then,\nperhaps, Zikali will be summoned to look into the matter, as he was\nbefore.\"\n\nWhat was she to do, she went on, ignoring my remark.\n\n\"Eat the porridge that you have made in your own pot, or break the pot\"\n(i.e. go away), I suggested. \"There was no need for you to marry Saduko,\nany more than there was for you to marry Masapo.\"\n\n\"How can you talk to me like that, Macumazahn,\" she answered, stamping\nher foot, \"when you know well it is your fault if I married anyone?\nPiff! I hate them all, and, since my father would only beat me if I took\nmy troubles to him, I will run off, and live in the wilderness alone and\nbecome a witch-doctoress.\"\n\n\"I am afraid you will find it very dull, Mameena,\" I began in a\nbantering tone, for, to tell the truth, I did not think it wise to show\nher too much sympathy while she was so excited.\n\nMameena never waited for the end of the sentence, but, sobbing out that\nI was false and cruel, she turned and departed swiftly. Oh! little did I\nforesee how and where we should meet again.\n\nNext morning I was awakened shortly after sunrise by Scowl, whom I had\nsent out with another man the night before to look for a lost ox.\n\n\"Well, have you found the ox?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, Baas; but I did not waken you to tell you that. I have a message\nfor you, Baas, from Mameena, wife of Saduko, whom I met about four hours\nago upon the plain yonder.\"\n\nI bade him set it out.\n\n\"These were the words of Mameena, Baas: 'Say to Macumazahn, your master,\nthat Indhlovu-ene-sihlonti, taking pity on my wrongs and loving me\nwith his heart, has offered to take me into his House and that I have\naccepted his offer, since I think it better to become the Inkosazana of\nthe Zulus, as I shall one day, than to remain a servant in the house\nof Nandie. Say to Macumazahn that when Saduko returns he is to tell him\nthat this is all his fault, since if he had kept Nandie in her place I\nwould have died rather than leave him. Let him say to Saduko also that,\nalthough from henceforth we can be no more than friends, my heart is\nstill tender towards him, and that by day and by night I will strive to\nwater his greatness, so that it may grow into a tree that shall shade\nthe land. Let Macumazahn bid him not to be angry with me, since what I\ndo I do for his good, as he would have found no happiness while Nandie\nand I dwelt in one house. Above all, also let him not be angry with the\nPrince, who loves him more than any man, and does but travel whither the\nwind that I breathe blows him. Bid Macumazahn think of me kindly, as I\nshall of him while my eyes are open.'\"\n\nI listened to this amazing message in silence, then asked if Mameena was\nalone.\n\n\"No, Baas; Umbelazi and some soldiers were with her, but they did\nnot hear her words, for she stepped aside to speak with me. Then she\nreturned to them, and they walked away swiftly, and were swallowed up in\nthe night.\"\n\n\"Very good, Sikauli,\" I said. \"Make me some coffee, and make it strong.\"\n\nI dressed and drank several cups of the coffee, all the while \"thinking\nwith my head,\" as the Zulus say. Then I walked up to the kraal to see\nUmbezi, whom I found just coming out of his hut, yawning.\n\n\"Why do you look so black upon this beautiful morning, Macumazahn?\"\nasked the genial old scamp. \"Have you lost your best cow, or what?\"\n\n\"No, my friend,\" I answered; \"but you and another have lost your best\ncow.\" And word for word I repeated to him Mameena's message. When I had\nfinished really I thought that Umbezi was about to faint.\n\n\"Curses be on the head of this Mameena!\" he exclaimed. \"Surely some evil\nspirit must have been her father, not I, and well was she called Child\nof Storm.[*] What shall I do now, Macumazahn? Thanks be to my Spirit,\"\nhe added, with an air of relief, \"she is too far gone for me to try to\ncatch her; also, if I did, Umbelazi and his soldiers would kill me.\"\n\n     [*--That, if I have not said so already, was the meaning\n     which the Zulus gave to the word \"Mameena\", although as I\n     know the language I cannot get any such interpretation out\n     of the name, I believe that it was given to her, however,\n     because she was born just before a terrible tempest, when\n     the wind wailing round the hut made a sound like the word\n     \"Ma-mee-na\". --A. Q.]\n\n\"And what will Saduko do if you don't?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, of course he will be angry, for no doubt he is fond of her. But,\nafter all, I am used to that. You remember how he went mad when she\nmarried Masapo. At least, he cannot say that I made her run away with\nUmbelazi. After all, it is a matter which they must settle between\nthem.\"\n\n\"I think it may mean great trouble,\" I said, \"at a time when trouble is\nnot needed.\"\n\n\"Oh, why so, Macumazahn? My daughter did not get on with the Princess\nNandie--we could all see that--for they would scarcely speak to each\nother. And if Saduko is fond of her--well, after all, there are other\nbeautiful women in Zululand. I know one or two of them myself whom I\nwill mention to Saduko--or rather to Nandie. Really, as things were, I\nam not sure but that he is well rid of her.\"\n\n\"But what do you think of the matter as her father?\" I asked, for I\nwanted to see to what length his accommodating morality would stretch.\n\n\"As her father--well, of course, Macumazahn, as her father I am sorry,\nbecause it will mean talk, will it not, as the Masapo business\ndid? Still, there is this to be said for Mameena,\" he added, with a\nbrightening face, \"she always runs away up the tree, not down. When she\ngot rid of Masapo--I mean when Masapo was killed for his witchcraft--she\nmarried Saduko, who was a bigger man--Saduko, whom she would not marry\nwhen Masapo was the bigger man. And now, when she has got rid of Saduko,\nshe enters the hut of Umbelazi, who will one day be King of the Zulus,\nthe biggest man in all the world, which means that she will be the\nbiggest woman, for remember, Macumazahn, she will walk round and round\nthat great Umbelazi till whatever way he looks he will see her and no\none else. Oh, she will grow great, and carry up her poor old father\nin the blanket on her back. Oh, the sun still shines behind the cloud,\nMacumazahn, so let us make the best of the cloud, since we know that it\nwill break out presently.\"\n\n\"Yes, Umbezi; but other things besides the sun break out from clouds\nsometimes--lightning, for instance; lightning which kills.\"\n\n\"You speak ill-omened words, Macumazahn; words that take away my\nappetite, which is generally excellent at this hour. Well, if Mameena is\nbad it is not my fault, for I brought her up to be good. After all,\"\nhe added with an outburst of petulance, \"why do you scold me when it is\nyour fault? If you had run away with the girl when you might have done\nso, there would have been none of this trouble.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" I answered; \"only then I am sure I should have been dead\nto-day, as I think that all who have to do with her will be ere long.\nAnd now, Umbezi, I wish you a good breakfast.\"\n\nOn the following morning, Saduko returned and was told the news by\nNandie, whom I had carefully avoided. On this occasion, however, I was\nforced to be present, as the person to whom the sinful Mameena had sent\nher farewell message. It was a very painful experience, of which I do\nnot remember all the details. For a while after he learned the truth\nSaduko sat still as a stone, staring in front of him, with a face that\nseemed to have become suddenly old. Then he turned upon Umbezi, and in a\nfew terrible words accused him of having arranged the matter in order to\nadvance his own fortunes at the price of his daughter's dishonour. Next,\nwithout listening to his ex-father-in-law's voluble explanations, he\nrose and said that he was going away to kill Umbelazi, the evil-doer who\nhad robbed him of the wife he loved, with the connivance of all three of\nus, and by a sweep of his hand he indicated Umbezi, the Princess Nandie\nand myself.\n\nThis was more than I could stand, so I, too, rose and asked him what he\nmeant, adding in the irritation of the moment that if I had wished to\nrob him of his beautiful Mameena, I thought I could have done so long\nago--a remark that staggered him a little.\n\nThen Nandie rose also, and spoke in her quiet voice.\n\n\"Saduko, my husband,\" she said, \"I, a Princess of the Zulu House,\nmarried you who are not of royal blood because I loved you, and although\nPanda the King and Umbelazi the Prince wished it, for no other reason\nwhatsoever. Well, I have been faithful to you through some trials, even\nwhen you set the widow of a wizard--if, indeed, as I have reason to\nsuspect, she was not herself the wizard--before me, and although that\nwizard had killed our son, lived in her hut rather than in mine. Now\nthis woman of whom you thought so much has deserted you for your\nfriend and my brother, the Prince Umbelazi--Umbelazi who is called the\nHandsome, and who, if the fortune of war goes with him, as it may or\nmay not, will succeed to Panda, my father. This she has done because she\nalleges that I, your Inkosikazi and the King's daughter, treated her as\na servant, which is a lie. I kept her in her place, no more, who, if\nshe could have had her will, would have ousted me from mine, perhaps by\ndeath, for the wives of wizards learn their arts. On this pretext she\nhas left you; but that is not her real reason. She has left you because\nthe Prince, my brother, whom she has befooled with her tricks and\nbeauty, as she has befooled others, or tried to\"--and she glanced at\nme--\"is a bigger man than you are. You, Saduko, may become great, as my\nheart prays that you will, but my brother may become a king. She does\nnot love him any more than she loved you, but she does love the place\nthat may be his, and therefore hers--she who would be the first doe of\nthe herd. My husband, I think that you are well rid of Mameena, for I\nthink also that if she had stayed with us there would have been more\ndeaths in our House; perhaps mine, which would not matter, and perhaps\nyours, which would matter much. All this I say to you, not from jealousy\nof one who is fairer than I, but because it is the truth. Therefore my\ncounsel to you is to let this business pass over and keep silent. Above\nall, seek not to avenge yourself upon Umbelazi, since I am sure that he\nhas taken vengeance to dwell with him in his own hut. I have spoken.\"\n\nThat this moderate and reasoned speech of Nandie's produced a great\neffect upon Saduko I could see, but at the time the only answer he made\nto it was:\n\n\"Let the name of Mameena be spoken no more within hearing of my ears.\nMameena is dead.\"\n\nSo her name was heard no more in the Houses of Saduko and of Umbezi, and\nwhen it was necessary for any reason to refer to her, she was given a\nnew name, a composite Zulu word, \"O-we-Zulu\", I think it was, which is\n\"Storm-child\" shortly translated, for \"Zulu\" means a storm as well as\nthe sky.\n\nI do not think that Saduko spoke of her to me again until towards the\nclimax of this history, and certainly I did not mention her to him. But\nfrom that day forward I noted that he was a changed man. His pride and\nopen pleasure in his great success, which had caused the Zulus to name\nhim the \"Self-eater,\" were no longer marked. He became cold and silent,\nlike a man who is thinking deeply, but who shutters his thoughts lest\nsome should read them through the windows of his eyes. Moreover, he paid\na visit to Zikali the Little and Wise, as I found out by accident; but\nwhat advice that cunning old dwarf gave to him I did not find out--then.\n\nThe only other event which happened in connection with this elopement\nwas that a message came from Umbelazi to Saduko, brought by one of the\nprinces, a brother of Umbelazi, who was of his party. As I know, for\nI heard it delivered, it was a very humble message when the relative\npositions of the two men are considered--that of one who knew that he\nhad done wrong, and, if not repentant, was heartily ashamed of himself.\n\n\"Saduko,\" it said, \"I have stolen a cow of yours, and I hope you will\nforgive me, since that cow did not love the pasture in your kraal, but\nin mine she grows fat and is content. Moreover, in return I will give\nyou many other cows. Everything that I have to give, I will give to you\nwho are my friend and trusted councillor. Send me word, O Saduko, that\nthis wall which I have built between us is broken down, since ere long\nyou and I must stand together in war.\"\n\nTo this message Saduko's answer was:\n\n\"O Prince, you are troubled about a very little thing. That cow which\nyou have taken was of no worth to me, for who wishes to keep a beast\nthat is ever tearing and lowing at the gates of the kraal, disturbing\nthose who would sleep inside with her noise? Had you asked her of me,\nI would have given her to you freely. I thank you for your offer, but I\nneed no more cows, especially if, like this one, they have no calves.\nAs for a wall between us, there is none, for how can two men who, if the\nbattle is to be won, must stand shoulder to shoulder, fight if divided\nby a wall? O Son of the King, I am dreaming by day and night of the\nbattle and the victory, and I have forgotten all about the barren cow\nthat ran away after you, the great bull of the herd. Only do not be\nsurprised if one day you find that this cow has a sharp horn.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. PANDA'S PRAYER\n\n\nAbout six weeks later, in the month of November, 1856, I chanced to\nbe at Nodwengu when the quarrel between the princes came to a head.\nAlthough none of the regiments was actually allowed to enter the\ntown--that is, as a regiment--the place was full of people, all of them\nin a state of great excitement, who came in during the daytime and went\nto sleep in the neighbouring military kraals at night. One evening,\nas some of these soldiers--about a thousand of them, if I remember\nright--were returning to the Ukubaza kraal, a fight occurred between\nthem, which led to the final outbreak.\n\nAs it happened, at that time there were two separate regiments stationed\nat this kraal. I think that they were the Imkulutshana and the Hlaba,\none of which favoured Cetewayo and the other Umbelazi. As certain\ncompanies of each of these regiments marched along together in parallel\nlines, two of their captains got into dispute on the eternal subject of\nthe succession to the throne. From words they came to blows, and the end\nof it was that he who favoured Umbelazi killed him who favoured Cetewayo\nwith his kerry. Thereon the comrades of the slain man, raising a shout\nof \"Usutu,\" which became the war-cry of Cetewayo's party, fell upon the\nothers, and a dreadful combat ensued. Fortunately the soldiers were only\narmed with sticks, or the slaughter would have been very great; but as\nit was, after an indecisive engagement, about fifty men were killed and\nmany more injured.\n\nNow, with my usual bad luck, I, who had gone out to shoot a few birds\nfor the pot--pauw, or bustard, I think they were--was returning across\nthis very plain to my old encampment in the kloof where Masapo had been\nexecuted, and so ran into the fight just as it was beginning. I saw the\ncaptain killed and the subsequent engagement. Indeed, as it happened, I\ndid more. Not knowing where to go or what to do, for I was quite alone,\nI pulled up my horse behind a tree and waited till I could escape the\nhorrors about me; for I can assure anyone who may ever read these words\nthat it is a very horrible sight to see a thousand men engaged in fierce\nand deadly combat. In truth, the fact that they had no spears, and could\nonly batter each other to death with their heavy kerries, made it worse,\nsince the duels were more desperate and prolonged.\n\nEverywhere men were rolling on the ground, hitting at each other's\nheads, until at last some blow went home and one of them threw out his\narms and lay still, either dead or senseless. Well, there I sat watching\nall this shocking business from the saddle of my trained shooting pony,\nwhich stood like a stone, till presently I became aware of two great\nfellows rushing at me with their eyes starting out of their heads and\nshouting as they came:\n\n\"Kill Umbelazi's white man! Kill! Kill!\"\n\nThen, seeing that the matter was urgent and that it was a question of my\nlife or theirs, I came into action.\n\nIn my hand I held a double-barrelled shotgun loaded with what we used\nto call \"loopers,\" or B.B. shot, of which but a few went to each charge,\nfor I had hoped to meet with a small buck on my way to camp. So, as\nthese soldiers came, I lifted the gun and fired, the right barrel at\none of them and the left barrel at the other, aiming in each case at the\ncentre of the small dancing shields, which from force of habit they held\nstretched out to protect their throats and breasts. At that distance, of\ncourse, the loopers sank through the soft hide of the shields and deep\ninto the bodies of those who carried them, so that both of them dropped\ndead, the left-hand man being so close that he fell against my pony, his\nuplifted kerry striking me upon the thigh and bruising me.\n\nWhen I saw what I had done, and that my danger was over for the moment,\nwithout waiting to reload I dug the spurs into my horse's sides and\ngalloped off to Nodwengu, passing between the groups of struggling men.\nOn arriving unharmed at the town, I went instantly to the royal huts and\ndemanded to see the King, who sent word that I was to be admitted.\nOn coming before him I told him exactly what had happened--that I had\nkilled two of Cetewayo's men in order to save my own life, and on that\naccount submitted myself to his justice.\n\n\"O Macumazana,\" said Panda in great distress, \"I know well that you\nare not to blame, and already I have sent out a regiment to stop this\nfighting, with command that those who caused it should be brought before\nme to-morrow for judgment. I am glad indeed, Macumazahn, that you have\nescaped without harm, but I must tell you that I fear henceforth your\nlife will be in danger, since all the Usutu party will hold it forfeit\nif they can catch you. While you are in my town I can protect you, for I\nwill set a strong guard about your camp; but here you will have to\nstay until these troubles are done with, since if you leave you may be\nmurdered on the road.\"\n\n\"I thank you for your kindness, King,\" I answered; \"but all this is very\nawkward for me, who hoped to trek for Natal to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Well, there it is, Macumazahn, you will have to stay here unless\nyou wish to be killed. He who walks into a storm must put up with the\nhailstones.\"\n\nSo it came about that once again Fate dragged me into the Zulu\nmaelstrom.\n\nOn the morrow I was summoned to the trial, half as a witness and half\nas one of the offenders. Going to the head of the Nodwengu kraal, where\nPanda was sitting in state with his Council, I found the whole great\nspace in front of him crowded with a dense concourse of fierce-faced\npartisans, those who favoured Cetewayo--the Usutu--sitting on the right,\nand those who favoured Umbelazi--the Isigqosa--sitting on the left. At\nthe head of the right-hand section sat Cetewayo, his brethren and chief\nmen. At the head of the left-hand section sat Umbelazi, his brethren and\nhis chief men, amongst whom I saw Saduko take a place immediately behind\nthe Prince, so that he could whisper into his ear.\n\nTo myself and my little band of eight hunters, who by Panda's express\npermission, came armed with their guns, as I did also, for I was\ndetermined that if the necessity arose we would sell our lives as dearly\nas we could, was appointed a place almost in front of the King and\nbetween the two factions. When everyone was seated the trial began,\nPanda demanding to know who had caused the tumult of the previous night.\n\nI cannot set out what followed in all its details, for it would be too\nlong; also I have forgotten many of them. I remember, however, that\nCetewayo's people said that Umbelazi's men were the aggressors, and that\nUmbelazi's people said that Cetewayo's men were the aggressors, and that\neach of their parties backed up these statements, which were given at\ngreat length, with loud shouts.\n\n\"How am I to know the truth?\" exclaimed Panda at last. \"Macumazahn, you\nwere there; step forward and tell it to me.\"\n\nSo I stood out and told the King what I had seen, namely that the\ncaptain who favoured Cetewayo had begun the quarrel by striking the\ncaptain who favoured Umbelazi, but that in the end Umbelazi's man had\nkilled Cetewayo's man, after which the fighting commenced.\n\n\"Then it would seem that the Usutu are to blame,\" said Panda.\n\n\"Upon what grounds do you say so, my father?\" asked Cetewayo, springing\nup. \"Upon the testimony of this white man, who is well known to be the\nfriend of Umbelazi and of his henchman Saduko, and who himself killed\ntwo of those who called me chief in the course of the fight?\"\n\n\"Yes, Cetewayo,\" I broke in, \"because I thought it better that I should\nkill them than that they should kill me, whom they attacked quite\nunprovoked.\"\n\n\"At any rate, you killed them, little White Man,\" shouted Cetewayo, \"for\nwhich cause your blood is forfeit. Say, did Umbelazi give you leave to\nappear before the King accompanied by men armed with guns, when we who\nare his sons must come with sticks only? If so, let him protect you!\"\n\n\"That I will do if there is need!\" exclaimed Umbelazi.\n\n\"Thank you, Prince,\" I said; \"but if there is need I will protect myself\nas I did yesterday,\" and, cocking my double-barrelled rifle, I looked\nfull at Cetewayo.\n\n\"When you leave here, then at least I will come even with you,\nMacumazahn!\" threatened Cetewayo, spitting through his teeth, as was his\nway when mad with passion.\n\nFor he was beside himself, and wished to vent his temper on someone,\nalthough in truth he and I were always good friends.\n\n\"If so I shall stop where I am,\" I answered coolly, \"in the shadow of\nthe King, your father. Moreover, are you so lost in folly, Cetewayo,\nthat you should wish to bring the English about your ears? Know that if\nI am killed you will be asked to give account of my blood.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" interrupted Panda, \"and know that if anyone lays a finger on\nMacumazana, who is my guest, he shall die, whether he be a common man or\na prince and my son. Also, Cetewayo, I fine you twenty head of cattle,\nto be paid to Macumazana because of the unprovoked attack which your men\nmade upon him when he rightly slew them.\"\n\n\"The fine shall be paid, my father,\" said Cetewayo more quietly, for he\nsaw that in threatening me he had pushed matters too far.\n\nThen, after some more talk, Panda gave judgment in the cause, which\njudgment really amounted to nothing. As it was impossible to decide\nwhich party was most to blame, he fined both an equal number of cattle,\naccompanying the fine with a lecture on their ill-behaviour, which was\nlistened to indifferently.\n\nAfter this matter was disposed of the real business of the meeting\nbegan.\n\nRising to his feet, Cetewayo addressed Panda.\n\n\"My father,\" he said, \"the land wanders and wanders in darkness, and you\nalone can give light for its feet. I and my brother, Umbelazi, are at\nvariance, and the quarrel is a great one, namely, as to which of us is\nto sit in your place when you are 'gone down,' when we call and you\ndo not answer. Some of the nation favour one of us and some favour\nthe other, but you, O King, and you alone, have the voice of judgment.\nStill, before you speak, I and those who stand with me would bring this\nto your mind. My mother, Umqumbazi, is your Inkosikazi, your head-wife,\nand therefore, according to our law, I, her eldest son, should be your\nheir. Moreover, when you fled to the Boers before the fall of him who\nsat in your place before you [Dingaan], did not they, the white Amabunu,\nask you which amongst your sons was your heir, and did you not point\nme out to the white men? And thereon did not the Amabunu clothe me in a\ndress of honour because I was the King to be? But now of late the mother\nof Umbelazi has been whispering in your ear, as have others\"--and he\nlooked at Saduko and some of Umbelazi's brethren--\"and your face has\ngrown cold towards me, so cold that many say that you will point out\nUmbelazi to be King after you and stamp on my name. If this is so, my\nfather, tell me at once, that I may know what to do.\"\n\nHaving finished this speech, which certainly did not lack force and\ndignity, Cetewayo sat down again, awaiting the answer in sullen silence.\nBut, making none, Panda looked at Umbelazi, who, on rising, was greeted\nwith a great cheer, for although Cetewayo had the larger following in\nthe land, especially among the distant chiefs, the Zulus individually\nloved Umbelazi more, perhaps because of his stature, beauty and kindly\ndisposition--physical and moral qualities that naturally appeal to a\nsavage nation.\n\n\"My father,\" he said, \"like my brother, Cetewayo, I await your word.\nWhatever you may have said to the Amabunu in haste or fear, I do not\nadmit that Cetewayo was ever proclaimed your heir in the hearing of the\nZulu people. I say that my right to the succession is as good as his,\nand that it lies with you, and you alone, to declare which of us shall\nput on the royal kaross in days that my heart prays may be distant.\nStill, to save bloodshed, I am willing to divide the land with Cetewayo\"\n(here both Panda and Cetewayo shook their heads and the audience roared\n\"Nay\"), \"or, if that does not please him, I am willing to meet Cetewayo\nman to man and spear to spear and fight till one of us be slain.\"\n\n\"A safe offer!\" sneered Cetewayo, \"for is not my brother named\n'Elephant,' and the strongest warrior among the Zulus? No, I will not\nset the fortunes of those who cling to me on the chance of a single\nstab, or on the might of a man's muscles. Decide, O father; say which\nof the two of us is to sit at the head of your kraal after you have gone\nover to the Spirits and are but an ancestor to be worshipped.\"\n\nNow, Panda looked much disturbed, as was not wonderful, since, rushing\nout from the fence behind which they had been listening, Umqumbazi,\nCetewayo's mother, whispered into one of his ears, while Umbelazi's\nmother whispered into the other. What advice each of them gave I do not\nknow, although obviously it was not the same advice, since the poor man\nrolled his eyes first at one and then at the other, and finally put his\nhands over his ears that he might hear no more.\n\n\"Choose, choose, O King!\" shouted the audience. \"Who is to succeed you,\nCetewayo or Umbelazi?\"\n\nWatching Panda, I saw that he fell into a kind of agony; his fat sides\nheaved, and, although the day was cold, sweat ran from his brow.\n\n\"What would the white men do in such a case?\" he said to me in a hoarse,\nlow voice, whereon I answered, looking at the ground and speaking so\nthat few could hear me:\n\n\"I think, O King, that a white man would do nothing. He would say that\nothers might settle the matter after he was dead.\"\n\n\"Would that I could say so, too,\" muttered Panda; \"but it is not\npossible.\"\n\nThen followed a long pause, during which all were silent, for every man\nthere felt that the hour was big with doom. At length Panda rose with\ndifficulty, because of his unwieldy weight, and uttered these fateful\nwords, that were none the less ominous because of the homely idiom in\nwhich they were couched:\n\n_\"When two young bulls quarrel they must fight it out.\"_\n\nInstantly in one tremendous roar volleyed forth the royal salute of\n\"Bay\u00e9te\", a signal of the acceptance of the King's word--the word that\nmeant civil war and the death of many thousands.\n\nThen Panda turned and, so feebly that I thought he would fall, walked\nthrough the gateway behind him, followed by the rival queens. Each of\nthese ladies struggled to be first after him in the gate, thinking that\nit would be an omen of success for her son. Finally, however, to the\ndisappointment of the multitude, they only succeeded in passing it side\nby side.\n\nWhen they had gone the great audience began to break up, the men of\neach party marching away together as though by common consent, without\noffering any insult or molestation to their adversaries. I think that\nthis peaceable attitude arose, however, from the knowledge that matters\nhad now passed from the stage of private quarrel into that of public\nwar. It was felt that their dispute awaited decision, not with sticks\noutside the Nodwengu kraal, but with spears upon some great battlefield,\nfor which they went to prepare.\n\nWithin two days, except for those regiments which Panda kept to guard\nhis person, scarcely a soldier was to be seen in the neighbourhood of\nNodwengu. The princes also departed to muster their adherents, Cetewayo\nestablishing himself among the Mandhlakazi that he commanded, and\nUmbelazi returning to the kraal of Umbezi, which happened to stand\nalmost in the centre of that part of the nation which adhered to him.\n\nWhether he took Mameena with him there I am not certain. I believe,\nhowever, that, fearing lest her welcome at her birthplace should be\nwarmer than she wished, she settled herself at some retired and outlying\nkraal in the neighbourhood, and there awaited the crisis of her fortune.\nAt any rate, I saw nothing of her, for she was careful to keep out of my\nway.\n\nWith Umbelazi and Saduko, however, I did have an interview. Before they\nleft Nodwengu they called on me together, apparently on the best of\nterms, and said in effect that they hoped for my support in the coming\nwar.\n\nI answered that, however well I might like them personally, a Zulu civil\nwar was no affair of mine, and that, indeed, for every reason, including\nthe supreme one of my own safety, I had better get out of the way at\nonce.\n\nThey argued with me for a long while, making great offers and promises\nof reward, till at length, when he saw that my determination could not\nbe shaken, Umbelazi said:\n\n\"Come, Saduko, let us humble ourselves no more before this white man.\nAfter all, he is right; the business is none of his, and why should we\nask him to risk his life in our quarrel, knowing as we do that white\nmen are not like us; they think a great deal of their lives. Farewell,\nMacumazahn. If I conquer and grow great you will always be welcome in\nZululand, whereas if I fail perhaps you will be best over the Tugela\nriver.\"\n\nNow, I felt the hidden taunt in this speech very keenly. Still, being\ndetermined that for once I would be wise and not allow my natural\ncuriosity and love of adventure to drag me into more risks and trouble,\nI replied:\n\n\"The Prince says that I am not brave and love my life, and what he says\nis true. I fear fighting, who by nature am a trader with the heart of\na trader, not a warrior with the heart of a warrior, like the great\nIndhlovu-ene-Sihlonti\"--words at which I saw the grave Saduko smile\nfaintly. \"So farewell to you, Prince, and may good fortune attend you.\"\n\nOf course, to call the Prince to his face by this nickname, which\nreferred to a defect in his person, was something of an insult; but\nI had been insulted, and meant to give him \"a Roland for his Oliver.\"\nHowever, he took it in good part.\n\n\"What is good fortune, Macumazahn?\" Umbelazi replied as he grasped my\nhand. \"Sometimes I think that to live and prosper is good fortune, and\nsometimes I think that to die and sleep is good fortune, for in sleep\nthere is neither hunger nor thirst of body or of spirit. In sleep there\ncome no cares; in sleep ambitions are at rest; nor do those who look no\nmore upon the sun smart beneath the treacheries of false women or false\nfriends. Should the battle turn against me, Macumazahn, at least that\ngood fortune will be mine, for never will I live to be crushed beneath\nCetewayo's heel.\"\n\nThen he went. Saduko accompanied him for a little way, but, making some\nexcuse to the Prince, came back and said to me:\n\n\"Macumazahn, my friend, I dare say that we part for the last time, and\ntherefore I make a request to you. It is as to one who is dead to me.\nMacumazahn, I believe that Umbelazi the thief\"--these words broke from\nhis lips with a hiss--\"has given her many cattle and hidden her away\neither in the kloof of Zikali the Wise, or near to it, under his care.\nNow, if the war should go against Umbelazi and I should be killed in\nit, I think evil will fall upon that woman's head, I who have grown sure\nthat it was she who was the wizard and not Masapo the Boar. Also, as one\nconnected with Umbelazi, who has helped him in his plots, she will be\nkilled if she is caught. Macumazahn, hearken to me. I will tell you the\ntruth. My heart is still on fire for that woman. She has bewitched me;\nher eyes haunt my sleep and I hear her voice in the wind. She is more to\nme than all the earth and all the sky, and although she has wronged me\nI do not wish that harm should come to her. Macumazahn, I pray you if I\ndie, do your best to befriend her, even though it be only as a servant\nin your house, for I think that she cares more for you than for anyone,\nwho only ran away with him\"--and he pointed in the direction that\nUmbelazi had taken--\"because he is a prince, who, in her folly, she\nbelieves will be a king. At least take her to Natal, Macumazahn, where,\nif you wish to be free of her, she can marry whom she will and will live\nsafe until night comes. Panda loves you much, and, whoever conquers in\nthe war, will give you her life if you ask it of him.\"\n\nThen this strange man drew the back of his hand across his eyes, from\nwhich I saw the tears were running, and, muttering, \"If you would have\ngood fortune remember my prayer,\" turned and left me before I could\nanswer a single word.\n\nAs for me, I sat down upon an ant-heap and whistled a whole hymn tune\nthat my mother had taught me before I could think at all. To be left\nthe guardian of Mameena! Talk of a \"damnosa hereditas,\" a terrible and\nmischievous inheritance--why, this was the worst that ever I heard of.\nA servant in my house indeed, knowing what _I_ did about her! Why, I had\nsooner share the \"good fortune\" which Umbelazi anticipated beneath\nthe sod. However, that was not in the question, and without it the\nalternative of acting as her guardian was bad enough, though I comforted\nmyself with the reflection that the circumstances in which this would\nbecome necessary might never arise. For, alas! I was sure that if they\ndid arise I should have to live up to them. True, I had made no promise\nto Saduko with my lips, but I felt, as I knew he felt, that this promise\nhad passed from my heart to his.\n\n\"That thief Umbelazi!\" Strange words to be uttered by a great vassal of\nhis lord, and both of them about to enter upon a desperate enterprise.\n\"A prince whom in her folly she believes will be a king.\" Stranger words\nstill. Then Saduko did not believe that he _would_ be a king! And yet he\nwas about to share the fortunes of his fight for the throne, he who said\nthat his heart was still on fire for the woman whom \"Umbelazi the thief\"\nhad stolen. Well, if I were Umbelazi, thought I to myself, I would\nrather that Saduko were not my chief councillor and general. But, thank\nHeaven! I was not Umbelazi, or Saduko, or any of them! And, thank Heaven\nstill more, I was going to begin my trek from Zululand on the morrow!\n\nMan proposes but God disposes. I did not trek from Zululand for many a\nlong day. When I got back to my wagons it was to find that my oxen had\nmysteriously disappeared from the veld on which they were accustomed\nto graze. They were lost; or perhaps they had felt the urgent need of\ntrekking from Zululand back to a more peaceful country. I sent all the\nhunters I had with me to look for them, only Scowl and I remaining\nat the wagons, which in those disturbed times I did not like to leave\nunguarded.\n\nFour days went by, a week went by, and no sign of either hunters or\noxen. Then at last a message, which reached me in some roundabout\nfashion, to the effect that the hunters had found the oxen a long way\noff, but on trying to return to Nodwengu had been driven by some of\nthe Usutu--that is, by Cetewayo's party--across the Tugela into Natal,\nwhence they dared not attempt to return.\n\nFor once in my life I went into a rage and cursed that nondescript kind\nof messenger, sent by I know not whom, in language that I think he will\nnot forget. Then, realising the futility of swearing at a mere tool, I\nwent up to the Great House and demanded an audience with Panda himself.\nPresently the inceku, or household servant, to whom I gave my message,\nreturned, saying that I was to be admitted at once, and on entering the\nenclosure I found the King sitting at the head of the kraal quite alone,\nexcept for a man who was holding a large shield over him in order to\nkeep off the sun.\n\nHe greeted me warmly, and I told him my trouble about the oxen, whereon\nhe sent away the shield-holder, leaving us two together.\n\n\"Watcher-by-Night,\" he said, \"why do you blame me for these events, when\nyou know that I am nobody in my own House? I say that I am a dead man,\nwhose sons fight for his inheritance. I cannot tell you for certain who\nit was that drove away your oxen. Still, I am glad that they are gone,\nsince I believe that if you had attempted to trek to Natal just now you\nwould have been killed on the road by the Usutu, who believe you to be a\ncouncillor of Umbelazi.\"\n\n\"I understand, O King,\" I answered, \"and I dare say that the accident of\nthe loss of my oxen is fortunate for me. But tell me now, what am I to\ndo? I wish to follow the example of John Dunn [another white man in the\ncountry who was much mixed up with Zulu politics] and leave the land.\nWill you give me more oxen to draw my wagons?\"\n\n\"I have none that are broken in, Macumazahn, for, as you know, we Zulus\npossess few wagons; and if I had I would not lend them to you, who do\nnot desire that your blood should be upon my head.\"\n\n\"You are hiding something from me, O King,\" I said bluntly. \"What is it\nthat you want me to do? Stay here at Nodwengu?\"\n\n\"No, Macumazahn. When the trouble begins I want you to go with a\nregiment of my own that I shall send to the assistance of my son,\nUmbelazi, so that he may have the benefit of your wisdom. O Macumazana,\nI will tell you the truth. My heart loves Umbelazi, and I fear me that\nhe is overmatched by Cetewayo. If I could I would save his life, but I\nknow not how to do so, since I must not seem to take sides too openly.\nBut I can send down a regiment as your escort, if you choose to go to\nview the battle as my agent and make report to me. Say, will you not\ngo?\"\n\n\"Why should I go?\" I answered, \"seeing that whoever wins I may be\nkilled, and that if Cetewayo wins I shall certainly be killed, and all\nfor no reward.\"\n\n\"Nay, Macumazahn; I will give orders that whoever conquers, the man that\ndares to lift a spear against you shall die. In this matter, at least, I\nshall not be disobeyed. Oh! I pray you, do not desert me in my trouble.\nGo down with the regiment that I shall send and breathe your wisdom into\nthe ear of my son, Umbelazi. As for your reward, I swear to you by the\nhead of the Black One [Chaka] that it shall be great. I will see to it\nthat you do not leave Zululand empty-handed, Macumazahn.\"\n\nStill I hesitated, for I mistrusted me of this business.\n\n\"O Watcher-by-Night,\" exclaimed Panda, \"you will not desert me, will\nyou? I am afraid for the son of my heart, Umbelazi, whom I love above\nall my children; I am much afraid for Umbelazi,\" and he burst into tears\nbefore me.\n\nIt was foolish, no doubt, but the sight of the old King weeping for his\nbest-beloved child, whom he believed to be doomed, moved me so much that\nI forgot my caution.\n\n\"If you wish it, O Panda,\" I said, \"I will go down to the battle with\nyour regiment and stand there by the side of the Prince Umbelazi.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. UMBELAZI THE FALLEN\n\n\nSo I stayed on at Nodwengu, who, indeed, had no choice in the matter,\nand was very wretched and ill at ease. The place was almost deserted,\nexcept for a couple of regiments which were quartered there, the\nSangqu and the Amawombe. This latter was the royal regiment, a kind\nof Household Guards, to which the Kings Chaka, Dingaan and Panda all\nbelonged in turn. Most of the headmen had taken one side or the other,\nand were away raising forces to fight for Cetewayo or Umbelazi, and even\nthe greater part of the women and children had gone to hide themselves\nin the bush or among the mountains, since none knew what would happen,\nor if the conquering army would not fall upon and destroy them.\n\nA few councillors, however, remained with Panda, among whom was old\nMaputa, the general, who had once brought me the \"message of the pills.\"\nSeveral times he visited me at night and told me the rumours that were\nflying about. From these I gathered that some skirmishes had taken place\nand the battle could not be long delayed; also that Umbelazi had chosen\nhis fighting ground, a plain near the banks of the Tugela.\n\n\"Why has he done this,\" I asked, \"seeing that then he will have a\nbroad river behind him, and if he is defeated water can kill as well as\nspears?\"\n\n\"I know not for certain,\" answered Maputa; \"but it is said because of a\ndream that Saduko, his general, has dreamed thrice, which dream declares\nthat there and there alone Umbelazi will find honour. At any rate, he\nhas chosen this place; and I am told that all the women and children of\nhis army, by thousands, are hidden in the bush along the banks of the\nriver, so that they may fly into Natal if there is need.\"\n\n\"Have they wings,\" I asked, \"wherewith to fly over the Tugela 'in\nwrath,' as it well may be after the rains? Oh, surely his Spirit has\nturned from Umbelazi!\"\n\n\"Aye, Macumazahn,\" he answered, \"I, too, think that ufulatewe idhlozi\n[that is, his own Spirit] has turned its back on him. Also I think that\nSaduko is no good councillor. Indeed, were I the prince,\" added the old\nfellow shrewdly, \"I would not keep him whose wife I had stolen as the\nwhisperer in my ear.\"\n\n\"Nor I, Maputa,\" I answered as I bade him good-bye.\n\nTwo days later, early in the morning, Maputa came to me again and said\nthat Panda wished to see me. I went to the head of the kraal, where I\nfound the King seated and before him the captains of the royal Amawombe\nregiment.\n\n\"Watcher-by-Night,\" he said, \"I have news that the great battle between\nmy sons will take place within a few days. Therefore I am sending down\nthis, my own royal regiment, under the command of Maputa the skilled in\nwar to spy out the battle, and I pray that you will go with it, that\nyou may give to the General Maputa and to the captains the help of\nyour wisdom. Now these are my orders to you, Maputa, and to you, O\ncaptains--that you take no part in the fight unless you should see that\nthe Elephant, my son Umbelazi, is fallen into a pit, and that then you\nshall drag him out if you can and save him alive. Now repeat my words to\nme.\"\n\nSo they repeated the words, speaking with one voice.\n\n\"Your answer, O Macumazana,\" he said when they had spoken.\n\n\"O King, I have told you that I will go--though I do not like war--and I\nwill keep my promise,\" I replied.\n\n\"Then make ready, Macumazahn, and be back here within an hour, for the\nregiment marches ere noon.\"\n\nSo I went up to my wagons and handed them over to the care of some men\nwhom Panda had sent to take charge of them. Also Scowl and I saddled our\nhorses, for this faithful fellow insisted upon accompanying me, although\nI advised him to stay behind, and got out our rifles and as much\nammunition as we could possibly need, and with them a few other\nnecessaries. These things done, we rode back to the gathering-place,\ntaking farewell of the wagons with a sad heart, since I, for one, never\nexpected to see them again.\n\nAs we went I saw that the regiment of the Amawombe, picked men every one\nof them, all fifty years of age or over, nearly four thousand strong,\nwas marshalled on the dancing-ground, where they stood company\nby company. A magnificent sight they were, with their white\nfighting-shields, their gleaming spears, their otter-skin caps, their\nkilts and armlets of white bulls' tails, and the snowy egret plumes\nwhich they wore upon their brows. We rode to the head of them, where I\nsaw Maputa, and as I came they greeted me with a cheer of welcome, for\nin those days a white man was a power in the land. Moreover, as I have\nsaid, the Zulus knew and liked me well. Also the fact that I was to\nwatch, or perchance to fight with them, put a good heart into the\nAmawombe.\n\nThere we stood until the lads, several hundreds of them, who bore\nthe mats and cooking vessels and drove the cattle that were to be\nour commissariat, had wended away in a long line. Then suddenly Panda\nappeared out of his hut, accompanied by a few servants, and seemed\nto utter some kind of prayer, as he did so throwing dust or powdered\nmedicine towards us, though what this ceremony meant I did not\nunderstand.\n\nWhen he had finished Maputa raised a spear, whereon the whole regiment,\nin perfect time, shouted out the royal salute, \"Bay\u00e9te\", with a\nsound like that of thunder. Thrice they repeated this tremendous and\nimpressive salute, and then were silent. Again Maputa raised his spear,\nand all the four thousand voices broke out into the Ingoma, or national\nchant, to which deep, awe-inspiring music we began our march. As I do\nnot think it has ever been written down, I will quote the words. They\nran thus:\n\n     \"Ba ya m'zonda,\n     Ba ya m'loyisa,\n     Izizwe zonke,\n     Ba zond', Inkoosi.\"[*]\n\n     [*--Literally translated, this famous chant, now, I think,\n     published for the first time, which, I suppose, will never\n     again pass the lips of a Zulu impi, means:\n\n     \"They [i.e. the enemy] bear him [i.e. the King] hatred,\n     They call down curses on his head,\n     All of them throughout this land\n     Abhor our King.\"\n\n     The Ingoma when sung by twenty or thirty thousand men\n     rushing down to battle must, indeed, have been a song to\n     hear.--EDITOR.]\n\nThe spirit of this fierce Ingoma, conveyed by sound, gesture and\ninflection of voice, not the exact words, remember, which are very rude\nand simple, leaving much to the imagination, may perhaps be rendered\nsomewhat as follows. An exact translation into English verse is almost\nimpossible--at any rate, to me:\n\n     \"Loud on their lips is lying,\n     Rebels their King defying.\n     There shall be dead and dying,\n\n     Red are their eyes with hate;\n     Lo! where our impis wait\n     Vengeance insatiate!\"\n\nIt was early on the morning of the 2nd of December, a cold, miserable\nmorning that came with wind and driving mist, that I found myself with\nthe Amawombe at the place known as Endondakusuka, a plain with some\nkopjes in it that lies within six miles of the Natal border, from which\nit is separated by the Tugela river.\n\nAs the orders of the Amawombe were to keep out of the fray if that were\npossible, we had taken up a position about a mile to the right of what\nproved to be the actual battlefield, choosing as our camping ground\na rising knoll that looked like a huge tumulus, and was fronted at a\ndistance of about five hundred yards by another smaller knoll. Behind us\nstretched bushland, or rather broken land, where mimosa thorns grew in\nscattered groups, sloping down to the banks of the Tugela about four\nmiles away.\n\nShortly after dawn I was roused from the place where I slept, wrapped\nup in some blankets, under a mimosa tree--for, of course, we had no\ntents--by a messenger, who said that the Prince Umbelazi and the white\nman, John Dunn, wished to see me. I rose and tidied myself as best I\ncould, since, if I can avoid it, I never like to appear before natives\nin a dishevelled condition. I remember that I had just finished brushing\nmy hair when Umbelazi arrived.\n\nI can see him now, looking a veritable giant in that morning mist.\nIndeed, there was something quite unearthly about his appearance as\nhe arose out of those rolling vapours, such light as there was being\nconcentrated upon the blade of his big spear, which was well known as\nthe broadest carried by any warrior in Zululand, and a copper torque he\nwore about his throat.\n\nThere he stood, rolling his eyes and hugging his kaross around him\nbecause of the cold, and something in his anxious, indeterminate\nexpression told me at once that he knew himself to be a man in terrible\ndanger. Just behind him, dark and brooding, his arms folded on\nhis breast, his eyes fixed upon the ground, looking, to my moved\nimagination, like an evil genius, stood the stately and graceful Saduko.\nOn his left was a young and sturdy white man carrying a rifle and\nsmoking a pipe, whom I guessed to be John Dunn, a gentleman whom, as it\nchanced, I had never met, while behind were a force of Natal Government\nZulus, clad in some kind of uniform and armed with guns, and with them a\nnumber of natives, also from Natal--\"kraal Kafirs,\" who carried stabbing\nassegais. One of these led John Dunn's horse.\n\nOf those Government men there may have been thirty or forty, and of the\n\"kraal Kafirs\" anything between two and three hundred.\n\nI shook Umbelazi's hand and gave him good-day.\n\n\"That is an ill day upon which no sun shines, O Macumazana,\" he\nanswered--words that struck me as ominous. Then he introduced me to John\nDunn, who seemed glad to meet another white man. Next, not knowing what\nto say, I asked the exact object of their visit, whereon Dunn began to\ntalk. He said that he had been sent over on the previous afternoon by\nCaptain Walmsley, who was an officer of the Natal Government stationed\nacross the border, to try to make peace between the Zulu factions, but\nthat when he spoke of peace one of Umbelazi's brothers--I think it was\nMantantashiya--had mocked at him, saying that they were quite strong\nenough to cope with the Usutu--that was Cetewayo's party. Also, he\nadded, that when he suggested that the thousands of women and children\nand the cattle should be got across the Tugela drift during the previous\nnight into safety in Natal, Mantantashiya would not listen, and Umbelazi\nbeing absent, seeking the aid of the Natal Government, he could do\nnothing.\n\n\"Quem Deus vult perdere prius dementat\" [whom God wishes to destroy, He\nfirst makes mad], quoted I to myself beneath my breath. This was one of\nthe Latin tags that my old father, who was a scholar, had taught me,\nand at that moment it came back to my mind. But as I suspected that John\nDunn knew no Latin, I only said aloud:\n\n\"What an infernal fool!\" (We were talking in English.) \"Can't you get\nUmbelazi to do it now?\" (I meant, to send the women and children across\nthe river.)\n\n\"I fear it is too late, Mr. Quatermain,\" he answered. \"The Usutu are\nin sight. Look for yourself.\" And he handed me a telescope which he had\nwith him.\n\nI climbed on to some rocks and scanned the plain in front of us, from\nwhich just then a puff of wind rolled away the mist. It was black with\nadvancing men! As yet they were a considerable distance away--quite two\nmiles, I should think--and coming on very slowly in a great half-moon\nwith thin horns and a deep breast; but a ray from the sun glittered upon\ntheir countless spears. It seemed to me that there must be quite twenty\nor thirty thousand of them in this breast, which was in three divisions,\ncommanded, as I learned afterwards, by Cetewayo, Uzimela, and by a young\nBoer named Groening.\n\n\"There they are, right enough,\" I said, climbing down from my rocks.\n\"What are you going to do, Mr. Dunn?\"\n\n\"Obey orders and try to make peace, if I can find anyone to make peace\nwith; and if I can't--well, fight, I suppose. And you, Mr. Quatermain?\"\n\n\"Oh, obey orders and stop here, I suppose. Unless,\" I added doubtfully,\n\"these Amawombe take the bit between their teeth and run away with me.\"\n\n\"They'll do that before nightfall, Mr. Quatermain, if I know anything of\nthe Zulus. Look here, why don't you get on your horse and come off with\nme? This is a queer place for you.\"\n\n\"Because I promised not to,\" I answered with a groan, for really, as\nI looked at those savages round me, who were already fingering their\nspears in a disagreeable fashion, and those other thousands of savages\nadvancing towards us, I felt such little courage as I possessed sinking\ninto my boots.\n\n\"Very well, Mr. Quatermain, you know your own business best; but I hope\nyou will come out of it safely, that is all.\"\n\n\"Same to you,\" I replied.\n\nThen John Dunn turned, and in my hearing asked Umbelazi what he knew of\nthe movements of the Usutu and of their plan of battle.\n\nThe Prince replied, with a shrug of his shoulders:\n\n\"Nothing at present, Son of Mr. Dunn, but doubtless before the sun is\nhigh I shall know much.\"\n\nAs he spoke a sudden gust of wind struck us, and tore the nodding\nostrich plume from its fastening on Umbelazi's head-ring. Whilst a\nmurmur of dismay rose from all who saw what they considered this very\nill-omened accident, away it floated into the air, to fall gently to the\nground at the feet of Saduko. He stooped, picked it up, and reset it\nin its place, saying as he did so, with that ready wit for which some\nKafirs are remarkable:\n\n\"So may I live, O Prince, to set the crown upon the head of Panda's\nfavoured son!\"\n\nThis apt speech served to dispel the general gloom caused by the\nincident, for those who heard it cheered, while Umbelazi thanked his\ncaptain with a nod and a smile. Only I noted that Saduko did not mention\nthe name of \"Panda's favoured son\" upon whose head he hoped to live to\nset the crown. Now, Panda had many sons, and that day would show which\nof them was favoured.\n\nA minute or two later John Dunn and his following departed, as he said,\nto try to make peace with the advancing Usutu. Umbelazi, Saduko and\ntheir escort departed also towards the main body of the host of the\nIsigqosa, which was massed to our left, \"sitting on their spears,\" as\nthe natives say, and awaiting the attack. As for me, I remained alone\nwith the Amawombe, drinking some coffee that Scowl had brewed for me,\nand forcing myself to swallow food.\n\nI can say honestly that I do not ever remember partaking of a more\nunhappy meal. Not only did I believe that I was looking on the last sun\nI should ever see--though by the way, there was uncommonly little of\nthat orb visible--but what made the matter worse was that, if so, I\nshould be called upon to die alone among savages, with not a single\nwhite face near to comfort me. Oh, how I wished I had never allowed\nmyself to be dragged into this dreadful business. Yes, and I was even\nmean enough to wish that I had broken my word to Panda and gone off with\nJohn Dunn when he invited me, although now I thank goodness that I did\nnot yield to that temptation and thereby sacrifice my self-respect.\n\nSoon, however, things grew so exciting that I forgot these and other\nmelancholy reflections in watching the development of events from the\nsummit of our tumulus-like knoll, whence I had a magnificent view of the\nwhole battle. Here, after seeing that his regiment made a full meal,\nas a good general should, old Maputa joined me, whom I asked whether he\nthought there would be any fighting for him that day.\n\n\"I think so, I think so,\" he answered cheerfully. \"It seems to me that\nthe Usutu greatly outnumber Umbelazi and the Isigqosa, and, of course,\nas you know, Panda's orders are that if he is in danger we must help\nhim. Oh, keep a good heart, Macumazahn, for I believe I can promise you\nthat you will see our spears grow red to-day. You will not go hungry\nfrom this battle to tell the white people that the Amawombe are cowards\nwhom you could not flog into the fight. No, no, Macumazahn, my Spirit\nlooks towards me this morning, and I who am old and who thought that\nI should die at length like a cow, shall see one more great fight--my\ntwentieth, Macumazahn; for I fought with this same Amawombe in all the\nBlack One's big battles, and for Panda against Dingaan also.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it will be your last,\" I suggested.\n\n\"I dare say, Macumazahn; but what does that matter if only I and the\nroyal regiment can make an end that shall be spoken of? Oh, cheer up,\ncheer up, Macumazahn; your Spirit, too, looks towards you, as I promise\nthat we all will do when the shields meet; for know, Macumazahn, that we\npoor black soldiers expect that you will show us how to fight this day,\nand, if need be, how to fall hidden in a heap of the foe.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" I replied, \"so this is what you Zulus mean by the 'giving of\ncounsel,' is it?--you infernal, bloodthirsty old scoundrel,\" I added in\nEnglish.\n\nBut I think Maputa never heard me. At any rate, he only seized my arm\nand pointed in front, a little to the left, where the horn of the great\nUsutu army was coming up fast, a long, thin line alive with twinkling\nspears; their moving arms and legs causing them to look like spiders, of\nwhich the bodies were formed by the great war shields.\n\n\"See their plan?\" he said. \"They would close on Umbelazi and gore him\nwith their horns and then charge with their head. The horn will pass\nbetween us and the right flank of the Isigqosa. Oh! awake, awake,\nElephant! Are you asleep with Mameena in a hut? Unloose your spears,\nChild of the King, and at them as they mount the slope. Behold!\" he went\non, \"it is the Son of Dunn that begins the battle! Did I not tell you\nthat we must look to the white men to show us the way? Peep through your\ntube, Macumazahn, and tell me what passes.\"\n\nSo I \"peeped,\" and, the telescope which John Dunn had kindly left with\nme being good though small, saw everything clearly enough. He rode\nup almost to the point of the left horn of the Usutu, waving a white\nhandkerchief and followed by his small force of police and Natal Kafirs.\nThen from somewhere among the Usutu rose a puff of smoke. Dunn had been\nfired at.\n\nHe dropped the handkerchief and leapt to the ground. Now he and his\npolice were firing rapidly in reply, and men fell fast among the Usutu.\nThey raised their war shout and came on, though slowly, for they feared\nthe bullets. Step by step John Dunn and his people were thrust back,\nfighting gallantly against overwhelming odds. They were level with us,\nnot a quarter of a mile to our left. They were pushed past us. They\nvanished among the bush behind us, and a long while passed before ever I\nheard what became of them, for we met no more that day.\n\nNow, the horns having done their work and wrapped themselves round\nUmbelazi's army as the nippers of a wasp close about a fly (why did\nnot Umbelazi cut off those horns, I wondered), the Usutu bull began\nhis charge. Twenty or thirty thousand strong, regiment after regiment,\nCetewayo's men rushed up the slope, and there, near the crest of\nit, were met by Umbelazi's regiments springing forward to repel the\nonslaught and shouting their battle-cry of \"Laba! Laba! Laba! Laba!\"\n\nThe noise of their meeting shields came to our ears like that of the\nroll of thunder, and the sheen of their stabbing-spears shone as shines\nthe broad summer lightning. They hung and wavered on the slope; then\nfrom the Amawombe ranks rose a roar of\n\n_\"Umbelazi wins!\"_\n\nWatching intently, we saw the Usutu giving back. Down the slope they\nwent, leaving the ground in front of them covered with black spots which\nwe knew to be dead or wounded men.\n\n\"Why does not the Elephant charge home?\" said Maputa in a perplexed\nvoice. \"The Usutu bull is on his back! Why does he not trample him?\"\n\n\"Because he is afraid, I suppose,\" I answered, and went on watching.\n\nThere was plenty to see, as it happened. Finding that they were not\npursued, Cetewayo's impi reformed swiftly at the bottom of the slope,\nin preparation for another charge. Among that of Umbelazi, above them,\nrapid movements took place of which I could not guess the meaning,\nwhich movements were accompanied by much noise of angry shouting. Then\nsuddenly, from the midst of the Isigqosa army, emerged a great body of\nmen, thousands strong, which ran swiftly, but in open order, down the\nslope towards the Usutu, holding their spears reversed. At first I\nthought that they were charging independently, till I saw the Usutu\nranks open to receive them with a shout of welcome.\n\n\"Treachery!\" I said. \"Who is it?\"\n\n\"Saduko, with the Amakoba and Amangwane soldiers and others. I know them\nby their head-dresses,\" answered Maputa in a cold voice.\n\n\"Do you mean that Saduko has gone over to Cetewayo with all his\nfollowing?\" I asked excitedly.\n\n\"What else, Macumazahn? Saduko is a traitor: Umbelazi is finished,\" and\nhe passed his hand swiftly across his mouth--a gesture that has only one\nmeaning among the Zulus.\n\nAs for me, I sat down upon a stone and groaned, for now I understood\neverything.\n\nPresently the Usutu raised fierce, triumphant shouts, and once again\ntheir impi, swelled with Saduko's power, began to advance up the slope.\nUmbelazi, and those of the Isigqosa party who clung to him--now, I\nshould judge, not more than eight thousand men--never stayed to wait the\nonslaught. They broke! They fled in a hideous rout, crashing through\nthe thin, left horn of the Usutu by mere weight of numbers, and\npassing behind us obliquely on their road to the banks of the Tugela. A\nmessenger rushed up to us, panting.\n\n\"These are the words of Umbelazi,\" he gasped. \"O Watcher-by-Night and O\nMaputa, Indhlovu-ene-sihlonti prays that you will hold back the Usutu,\nas the King bade you do in case of need, and so give to him and those\nwho cling to him time to escape with the women and children into\nNatal. His general, Saduko, has betrayed him, and gone over with three\nregiments to Cetewayo, and therefore we can no longer stand against the\nthousands of the Usutu.\"\n\n\"Go tell the prince that Macumazahn, Maputa, and the Amawombe regiment\nwill do their best,\" answered Maputa calmly. \"Still, this is our advice\nto him, that he should cross the Tugela swiftly with the women and the\nchildren, seeing that we are few and Cetewayo is many.\"\n\nThe messenger leapt away, but, as I heard afterwards, he never found\nUmbelazi, since the poor man was killed within five hundred yards of\nwhere we stood.\n\nThen Maputa gave an order, and the Amawombe formed themselves into a\ntriple line, thirteen hundred men in the first line, thirteen hundred\nmen in the second line, and about a thousand in the third, behind whom\nwere the carrier boys, three or four hundred of them. The place assigned\nto me was in the exact centre of the second line, where, being mounted\non a horse, it was thought, as I gathered, that I should serve as a\nconvenient rallying-point.\n\nIn this formation we advanced a few hundred yards to our left, evidently\nwith the object of interposing ourselves between the routed impi and the\npursuing Usutu, or, if the latter should elect to go round us, with that\nof threatening their flank. Cetewayo's generals did not leave us long in\ndoubt as to what they would do. The main body of their army bore away\nto the right in pursuit of the flying foe, but three regiments, each\nof about two thousand five hundred spears, halted. Five minutes passed\nperhaps while they marshalled, with a distance of some six hundred yards\nbetween them. Each regiment was in a triple line like our own.\n\nTo me that seemed a very long five minutes, but, reflecting that it was\nprobably my last on earth, I tried to make the best of it in a fashion\nthat can be guessed. Strange to say, however, I found it impossible to\nkeep my mind fixed upon those matters with which it ought to have been\nfilled. My eyes and thoughts would roam. I looked at the ranks of the\nveteran Amawombe, and noted that they were still and solemn as men about\nto die should be, although they showed no sign of fear. Indeed, I\nsaw some of those near me passing their snuffboxes to each other. Two\ngrey-haired men also, who evidently were old friends, shook hands as\npeople do who are parting before a journey, while two others discussed\nin a low voice the possibility of our wiping out most of the Usutu\nbefore we were wiped out ourselves.\n\n\"It depends,\" said one of them, \"whether they attack us regiment by\nregiment or all together, as they will do if they are wise.\"\n\nThen an officer bade them be silent, and conversation ceased. Maputa\npassed through the ranks giving orders to the captains. From a distance\nhis withered old body, with a fighting shield held in front of it,\nlooked like that of a huge black ant carrying something in its mouth. He\ncame to where Scowl and I sat upon our horses.\n\n\"Ah! I see that you are ready, Macumazahn,\" he said in a cheerful voice.\n\"I told you that you should not go away hungry, did I not?\"\n\n\"Maputa,\" I said in remonstrance, \"what is the use of this? Umbelazi is\ndefeated, you are not of his impi, why send all these\"--and I waved my\nhand--\"down into the darkness? Why not go to the river and try to save\nthe women and children?\"\n\n\"Because we shall take many of those down into the darkness with us,\nMacumazahn,\" and he pointed to the dense masses of the Usutu. \"Yet,\" he\nadded, with a touch of compunction, \"this is not your quarrel. You and\nyour servant have horses. Slip out, if you will, and gallop hard to the\nlower drift. You may get away with your lives.\"\n\nThen my white man's pride came to my aid.\n\n\"Nay,\" I answered, \"I will not run while others stay to fight.\"\n\n\"I never thought you would, Macumazahn, who, I am sure, do not wish to\nearn a new and ugly name. Well, neither will the Amawombe run to become\na mock among their people. The King's orders were that we should try to\nhelp Umbelazi, if the battle went against him. We obey the King's orders\nby dying where we stand. Macumazahn, do you think that you could hit\nthat big fellow who is shouting insults at us there? If so, I should be\nobliged to you, as I dislike him very much,\" and he showed me a captain\nwho was swaggering about in front of the lines of the first of the Usutu\nregiments, about six hundred yards away.\n\n\"I will try,\" I answered, \"but it's a long shot.\" Dismounting, I climbed\na pile of stones and, resting my rifle on the topmost of them, took\na very full sight, aimed, held my breath, and pressed the trigger. A\nsecond afterwards the shouter of insults threw his arms wide, letting\nfall his spear, and pitched forward on to his face.\n\nA roar of delight rose from the watching Amawombe, while old Maputa\nclapped his thin brown hands and grinned from ear to ear.\n\n\"Thank you, Macumazahn. A very good omen! Now I am sure that, whatever\nthose Isigqosa dogs of Umbelazi's may do, we King's men shall make an\nexcellent end, which is all that we can hope. Oh, what a beautiful shot!\nIt will be something to think of when I am an idhlozi, a spirit-snake,\ncrawling about my own kraal. Farewell, Macumazahn,\" and he took my\nhand and pressed it. \"The time has come. I go to lead the charge. The\nAmawombe have orders to defend you to the last, for I wish you to see\nthe finish of this fight. Farewell.\"\n\nThen off he hurried, followed by his orderlies and staff-officers.\n\nI never saw him again alive, though I think that once in after years I\ndid meet his idhlozi in his kraal under strange circumstances. But that\nhas nothing to do with this history.\n\nAs for me, having reloaded, I mounted my horse again, being afraid lest,\nif I went on shooting, I should miss and spoil my reputation. Besides,\nwhat was the use of killing more men unless I was obliged? There were\nplenty ready to do that.\n\nAnother minute, and the regiment in front of us began to move, while the\nother two behind it ostentatiously sat themselves down in their ranks,\nto show that they did not mean to spoil sport. The fight was to begin\nwith a duel between about six thousand men.\n\n\"Good!\" muttered the warrior who was nearest me. \"They are in our bag.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" answered another, \"those little boys\" (used as a term of\ncontempt) \"are going to learn their last lesson.\"\n\nFor a few seconds there was silence, while the long ranks leant forward\nbetween the hedges of lean and cruel spears. A whisper went down the\nline; it sounded like the noise of wind among trees, and was the signal\nto prepare. Next a far-off voice shouted some word, which was repeated\nagain and again by other voices before and behind me. I became aware\nthat we were moving, quite slowly at first, then more quickly. Being\nlifted above the ranks upon my horse I could see the whole advance,\nand the general aspect of it was that of a triple black wave, each wave\ncrowned with foam--the white plumes and shields of the Amawombe were\nthe foam--and alive with sparkles of light--their broad spears were the\nlight.\n\nWe were charging now--and oh! the awful and glorious excitement of that\ncharge! Oh, the rush of the bending plumes and the dull thudding of\neight thousand feet! The Usutu came up the slope to meet us. In silence\nwe went, and in silence they came. We drew near to each other. Now we\ncould see their faces peering over the tops of their mottled shields,\nand now we could see their fierce and rolling eyes.\n\nThen a roar--a rolling roar such as at that time I had never heard:\nthe thunder of the roar of the meeting shields--and a flash--a swift,\nsimultaneous flash, the flash of the lightning of the stabbing spears.\nUp went the cry of:\n\n_\"Kill, Amawombe, kill!\"_ answered by another cry of:\n\n_\"Toss, Usutu, toss!\"_\n\nAfter that, what happened? Heaven knows alone--or at least I do not.\nBut in later years Mr. Osborn, afterwards the resident magistrate at\nNewcastle, in Natal, who, being young and foolish in those days, had\nswum his horse over the Tugela and hidden in a little kopje quite near\nto us in order to see the battle, told me that it looked as though\nsome huge breaker--that breaker being the splendid Amawombe--rolling in\ntowards the shore with the weight of the ocean behind it, had suddenly\nstruck a ridge of rock and, rearing itself up, submerged and hidden it.\n\nAt least, within three minutes that Usutu regiment was no more. We\nhad killed them every one, and from all along our lines rose a fierce\nhissing sound of \"S'gee, S'gee\" (\"Zhi\" in the Zulu) uttered as the\nspears went home in the bodies of the conquered.\n\nThat regiment had gone, taking nearly a third of our number with it, for\nin such a battle as this the wounded were as good as dead. Practically\nour first line had vanished in a fray that did not last more than a few\nminutes. Before it was well over the second Usutu regiment sprang up and\ncharged. With a yell of victory we rushed down the slope towards them.\nAgain there was the roar of the meeting shields, but this time the fight\nwas more prolonged, and, being in the front rank now, I had my share of\nit. I remember shooting two Usutu who stabbed at me, after which my gun\nwas wrenched from my hand. I remember the m\u00eal\u00e9e swinging backwards and\nforwards, the groans of the wounded, the shouts of victory and despair,\nand then Scowl's voice saying:\n\n\"We have beat them, Baas, but here come the others.\"\n\n\nThe third regiment was on our shattered lines. We closed up, we fought\nlike devils, even the bearer boys rushed into the fray. From all sides\nthey poured down upon us, for we had made a ring; every minute men died\nby hundreds, and, though their numbers grew few, not one of the Amawombe\nyielded. I was fighting with a spear now, though how it came into my\nhand I cannot remember for certain. I think, however, I wrenched it from\na man who rushed at me and was stabbed before he could strike. I killed\na captain with this spear, for as he fell I recognised his face. It was\nthat of one of Cetewayo's companions to whom I had sold some cloth at\nNodwengu. The fallen were piled up quite thick around me--we were using\nthem as a breastwork, friend and foe together. I saw Scowl's horse rear\ninto the air and fall. He slipped over its tail, and next instant was\nfighting at my side, also with a spear, muttering Dutch and English\noaths as he struck.\n\n\"Beetje varm! [a little hot] Beetje varm, Baas!\" I heard him say. Then\nmy horse screamed aloud and something hit me hard upon the head--I\nsuppose it was a thrown kerry--after which I remember nothing for a\nwhile, except a sensation of passing through the air.\n\nI came to myself again, and found that I was still on the horse, which\nwas ambling forward across the veld at a rate of about eight miles an\nhour, and that Scowl was clinging to my stirrup leather and running at\nmy side. He was covered with blood, so was the horse, and so was I. It\nmay have been our own blood, for all three were more or less wounded, or\nit may have been that of others; I am sure I do not know, but we were\na terrible sight. I pulled upon the reins, and the horse stopped among\nsome thorns. Scowl felt in the saddlebags and found a large flask of\nHollands gin and water--half gin and half water--which he had placed\nthere before the battle. He uncorked and gave it to me. I took a long\npull at the stuff, that tasted like veritable nectar, then handed it to\nhim, who did likewise. New life seemed to flow into my veins. Whatever\nteetotallers may say, alcohol is good at such a moment.\n\n\"Where are the Amawombe?\" I asked.\n\n\"All dead by now, I think, Baas, as we should be had not your horse\nbolted. Wow! but they made a great fight--one that will be told of! They\nhave carried those three regiments away upon their spears.\"\n\n\"That's good,\" I said. \"But where are we going?\"\n\n\"To Natal, I hope, Baas. I have had enough of the Zulus for the present.\nThe Tugela is not far away, and we will swim it. Come on, before our\nhurts grow stiff.\"\n\nSo we went on, till presently we reached the crest of a rise of ground\noverlooking the river, and there saw and heard dreadful things, for\nbeneath us those devilish Usutu were massacring the fugitives and the\ncamp-followers. These were being driven by the hundred to the edge of\nthe water, there to perish on the banks or in the stream, which was\nblack with drowned or drowning forms.\n\nAnd oh! the sounds! Well, these I will not attempt to describe.\n\n\"Keep up stream,\" I said shortly, and we struggled across a kind of\ndonga, where only a few wounded men were hidden, into a somewhat denser\npatch of bush that had scarcely been entered by the flying Isigqosa,\nperhaps because here the banks of the river were very steep and\ndifficult; also, between them its waters ran swiftly, for this was above\nthe drift.\n\nFor a while we went on in safety, then suddenly I heard a noise. A great\nman plunged past me, breaking through the bush like a buffalo, and came\nto a halt upon a rock which overhung the Tugela, for the floods had\neaten away the soil beneath.\n\n\"Umbelazi!\" said Scowl, and as he spoke we saw another man following as\na wild dog follows a buck.\n\n\"Saduko!\" said Scowl.\n\nI rode on. I could not help riding on, although I knew it would be safer\nto keep away. I reached the edge of that big rock. Saduko and Umbelazi\nwere fighting there.\n\nIn ordinary circumstances, strong and active as he was, Saduko would\nhave had no chance against the most powerful Zulu living. But the prince\nwas utterly exhausted; his sides were going like a blacksmith's bellows,\nor those of a fat eland bull that has been galloped to a standstill.\nMoreover, he seemed to me to be distraught with grief, and, lastly, he\nhad no shield left, nothing but an assegai.\n\nA stab from Saduko's spear, which he partially parried, wounded him\nslightly on the head, and cut loose the fillet of his ostrich plume,\nthat same plume which I had seen blown off in the morning, so that\nit fell to the ground. Another stab pierced his right arm, making\nit helpless. He snatched the assegai with his left hand, striving to\ncontinue the fight, and just at that moment we came up.\n\n\"What are you doing, Saduko?\" I cried. \"Does a dog bite his own master?\"\n\nHe turned and stared at me; both of them stared at me.\n\n\"Aye, Macumazahn,\" he answered in an icy voice, \"sometimes when it is\nstarving and that full-fed master has snatched away its bone. Nay, stand\naside, Macumazahn\" (for, although I was quite unarmed, I had stepped\nbetween them), \"lest you should share the fate of this woman-thief.\"\n\n\"Not I, Saduko,\" I cried, for this sight made me mad, \"unless you murder\nme.\"\n\nThen Umbelazi spoke in a hollow voice, sobbing out his words:\n\n\"I thank you, White Man, yet do as this snake bids you--this snake that\nhas lived in my kraal and fed out of my cup. Let him have his fill of\nvengeance because of the woman who bewitched me--yes, because of the\nsorceress who has brought me and thousands to the dust. Have you heard,\nMacumazahn, of the great deed of this son of Matiwane? Have you heard\nthat all the while he was a traitor in the pay of Cetewayo, and that he\nwent over, with the regiments of his command, to the Usutu just when the\nbattle hung upon the turn? Come, Traitor, here is my heart--the heart\nthat loved and trusted you. Strike--strike hard!\"\n\n\"Out of the way, Macumazahn!\" hissed Saduko. But I would not stir.\n\nHe sprang at me, and, though I put up the best fight that I could in\nmy injured state, got his hands about my throat and began to choke\nme. Scowl ran to help me, but his wound--for he was hurt--or his utter\nexhaustion took effect on him. Or perhaps it was excitement. At any\nrate, he fell down in a fit. I thought that all was over, when again I\nheard Umbelazi's voice, and felt Saduko's grip loosen at my throat, and\nsat up.\n\n\"Dog,\" said the Prince, \"where is your assegai?\" And as he spoke he\nthrew it from him into the river beneath, for he had picked it up while\nwe struggled, but, as I noted, retained his own. \"Now, dog, why do I not\nkill you, as would have been easy but now? I will tell you. Because I\nwill not mix the blood of a traitor with my own. See!\" He set the haft\nof his broad spear upon the rock and bent forward over the blade. \"You\nand your witch-wife have brought me to nothing, O Saduko. My blood, and\nthe blood of all who clung to me, is on your head. Your name shall\nstink for ever in the nostrils of all true men, and I whom you have\nbetrayed--I, the Prince Umbelazi--will haunt you while you live; yes,\nmy spirit shall enter into you, and when you die--ah! then we'll meet\nagain. Tell this tale to the white men, Macumazahn, my friend, on whom\nbe honour and blessings.\"\n\nHe paused, and I saw the tears gush from his eyes--tears mingled\nwith blood from the wound in his head. Then suddenly he uttered the\nbattle-cry of \"Laba! Laba!\" and let his weight fall upon the point of\nthe spear.\n\nIt pierced him through and through. He fell on to his hands and knees.\nHe looked up at us--oh, the piteousness of that look!--and then rolled\nsideways from the edge of the rock.\n\nA heavy splash, and that was the end of Umbelazi the Fallen--Umbelazi,\nabout whom Mameena had cast her net.\n\n\nA sad story in truth. Although it happened so many years ago I weep as I\nwrite it--I weep as Umbelazi wept.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. UMBEZI AND THE BLOOD ROYAL\n\n\nAfter this I think that some of the Usutu came up, for it seemed to me\nthat I heard Saduko say:\n\n\"Touch not Macumazahn or his servant. They are my prisoners. He who\nharms them dies, with all his House.\"\n\nSo they put me, fainting, on my horse, and Scowl they carried away upon\na shield.\n\nWhen I came to I found myself in a little cave, or rather beneath some\noverhanging rocks, at the side of a kopje, and with me Scowl, who had\nrecovered from his fit, but seemed in a very bewildered condition.\nIndeed, neither then nor afterwards did he remember anything of the\ndeath of Umbelazi, nor did I ever tell him that tale. Like many others,\nhe thought that the Prince had been drowned in trying to swim the\nTugela.\n\n\"Are they going to kill us?\" I asked of him, since, from the triumphant\nshouting without, I knew that we must be in the midst of the victorious\nUsutu.\n\n\"I don't know, Baas,\" he answered. \"I hope not; after we have gone\nthrough so much it would be a pity. Better to have died at the beginning\nof the battle.\"\n\nI nodded my head in assent, and just at that moment a Zulu, who had very\nevidently been fighting, entered the place carrying a dish of toasted\nlumps of beef and a gourd of water.\n\n\"Cetewayo sends you these, Macumazahn,\" he said, \"and is sorry that\nthere is no milk or beer. When you have eaten a guard waits without to\nescort you to him.\" And he went.\n\n\"Well,\" I said to Scowl, \"if they were going to kill us, they would\nscarcely take the trouble to feed us first. So let us keep up our hearts\nand eat.\"\n\n\"Who knows?\" answered poor Scowl, as he crammed a lump of beef into\nhis big mouth. \"Still, it is better to die on a full than on an empty\nstomach.\"\n\nSo we ate and drank, and, as we were suffering more from exhaustion than\nfrom our hurts, which were not really serious, our strength came back\nto us. As we finished the last lump of meat, which, although it had been\nonly half cooked upon the point of an assegai, tasted very good, the\nZulu put his head into the mouth of the shelter and asked if we were\nready. I nodded, and, supporting each other, Scowl and I limped from the\nplace. Outside were about fifty soldiers, who greeted us with a shout\nthat, although it was mixed with laughter at our pitiable appearance,\nstruck me as not altogether unfriendly. Amongst these men was my horse,\nwhich stood with its head hanging down, looking very depressed. I was\nhelped on to its back, and, Scowl clinging to the stirrup leather, we\nwere led a distance of about a quarter of a mile to Cetewayo.\n\nWe found him seated, in the full blaze of the evening sun, on the\neastern slope of one of the land-waves of the veld, with the open\nplain in front of him. It was a strange and savage scene. There sat the\nvictorious prince, surrounded by his captains and indunas, while before\nhim rushed the triumphant regiments, shouting his titles in the\nmost extravagant language. Izimbongi also--that is, professional\npraisers--were running up and down before him dressed in all sorts of\nfinery, telling his deeds, calling him \"Eater-up-of-the-Earth,\" and\nyelling out the names of those great ones who had been killed in the\nbattle.\n\nMeanwhile parties of bearers were coming up continually, carrying dead\nmen of distinction upon shields and laying them out in rows, as game\nis laid out at the end of a day's shooting in England. It seems that\nCetewayo had taken a fancy to see them, and, being too tired to walk\nover the field of battle, ordered that this should be done. Among these,\nby the way, I saw the body of my old friend, Maputa, the general of the\nAmawombe, and noted that it was literally riddled with spear thrusts,\nevery one of them in front; also that his quaint face still wore a\nsmile.\n\nAt the head of these lines of corpses were laid six dead, all men of\nlarge size, in whom I recognised the brothers of Umbelazi, who had\nfought on his side, and the half-brothers of Cetewayo. Among them were\nthose three princes upon whom the dust had fallen when Zikali, the\nprophet, smelt out Masapo, the husband of Mameena.\n\nDismounting from my horse, with the help of Scowl, I limped through and\nover the corpses of these fallen royalties, cut in the Zulu fashion to\nfree their spirits, which otherwise, as they believed, would haunt the\nslayers, and stood in front of Cetewayo.\n\n\"Siyakubona, Macumazahn,\" he said, stretching out his hand to me, which\nI took, though I could not find it in my heart to wish _him_ \"good day.\"\n\n\"I hear that you were leading the Amawombe, whom my father, the King,\nsent down to help Umbelazi, and I am very glad that you have escaped\nalive. Also my heart is proud of the fight that they made, for you know,\nMacumazahn, once, next to the King, I was general of that regiment,\nthough afterwards we quarrelled. Still, I am pleased that they did so\nwell, and I have given orders that every one of them who remains alive\nis to be spared, that they may be officers of a new Amawombe which I\nshall raise. Do you know, Macumazahn, that you have nearly wiped out\nthree whole regiments of the Usutu, killing many more people than did\nall my brother's army, the Isigqosa? Oh, you are a great man. Had it\nnot been for the loyalty\"--this word was spoken with just a tinge of\nsarcasm--\"of Saduko yonder, you would have won the day for Umbelazi.\nWell, now that this quarrel is finished, if you will stay with me I\nwill make you general of a whole division of the King's army, since\nhenceforth I shall have a voice in affairs.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, O Son of Panda,\" I answered; \"the splendour of the\nAmawombe's great stand against a multitude is on the name of Maputa, the\nKing's councillor and the induna of the Black One [Chaka], who is gone.\nHe lies yonder in his glory,\" and I pointed to Maputa's pierced body. \"I\ndid but fight as a soldier in his ranks.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, we know that, we know all that, Macumazahn; and Maputa was a\nclever monkey in his way, but we know also that you taught him how to\njump. Well, he is dead, and nearly all the Amawombe are dead, and of\nmy three regiments but a handful is left; the vultures have the rest\nof them. That is all finished and forgotten, Macumazahn, though by good\nfortune the spears went wide of you, who doubtless are a magician, since\notherwise you and your servant and your horse would not have escaped\nwith a few scratches when everyone else was killed. But you did escape,\nas you have done before in Zululand; and now you see here lie certain\nmen who were born of my father. Yet one is missing--he against whom I\nfought, aye, and he whom, although we fought, I loved the best of all\nof them. Now, it has been whispered in my ear that you alone know what\nbecame of him, and, Macumazahn, I would learn whether he lives or is\ndead; also, if he is dead, by whose hand he died, who would reward that\nhand.\"\n\nNow, I looked round me, wondering whether I should tell the truth or\nhold my tongue, and as I looked my eyes met those of Saduko, who, cold\nand unconcerned, was seated among the captains, but at a little distance\nfrom any of them--a man apart; and I remembered that he and I alone knew\nthe truth of the end of Umbelazi.\n\nWhy, I do not know, but it came into my mind that I would keep the\nsecret. Why should I tell the triumphant Cetewayo that Umbelazi had been\ndriven to die by his own hand; why should I lay bare Saduko's victory\nand shame? All these matters had passed into the court of a different\ntribunal. Who was I that I should reveal them or judge the actors of\nthis terrible drama?\n\n\"O Cetewayo,\" I said, \"as it chanced I saw the end of Umbelazi. No enemy\nkilled him. He died of a broken heart upon a rock above the river; and\nfor the rest of the story go ask the Tugela into which he fell.\"\n\nFor a moment Cetewayo hid his eyes with his hand.\n\n\"Is it so?\" he said presently. \"Wow! I say again that had it not been\nfor Saduko, the son of Matiwane, yonder, who had some quarrel with\nIndhlovu-ene-Sihlonti about a woman and took his chance of vengeance,\nit might have been I who died of a broken heart upon a rock above the\nriver. Oh, Saduko, I owe you a great debt and will pay you well; but you\nshall be no friend of mine, lest we also should chance to quarrel about\na woman, and _I_ should find myself dying of a broken heart on a rock\nabove a river. O my brother Umbelazi, I mourn for you, my brother, for,\nafter all, we played together when we were little and loved each other\nonce, who in the end fought for a toy that is called a throne, since,\nas our father said, two bulls cannot live in the same yard, my brother.\nWell, you are gone and I remain, yet who knows but that at the last your\nlot may be happier than mine. You died of a broken heart, Umbelazi, but\nof what shall _I_ die, I wonder?\"[*]\n\n     [*--That history of Cetewayo's fall and tragic death and of\n     Zikali's vengeance I hope to write one day, for in these\n     events also I was destined to play a part.--A. Q.]\n\nI have given this interview in detail, since it was because of it that\nthe saying went abroad that Umbelazi died of a broken heart.\n\nSo in truth he did, for before his spear pierced it his heart was\nbroken.\n\nNow, seeing that Cetewayo was in one of his soft moods, and that he\nseemed to look upon me kindly, though I had fought against him, I\nreflected that this would be a good opportunity to ask his leave to\ndepart. To tell the truth, my nerves were quite shattered with all I had\ngone through, and I longed to be away from the sights and sounds of that\nterrible battlefield, on and about which so many thousand people had\nperished this fateful day, as I had seldom longed for anything before.\nBut while I was making up my mind as to the best way to approach him,\nsomething happened which caused me to lose my chance.\n\nHearing a noise behind me, I looked round, to see a stout man arrayed\nin a very fine war dress, and waving in one hand a gory spear and in the\nother a head-plume of ostrich feathers, who was shouting out:\n\n\"Give me audience of the son of the King! I have a song to sing to the\nPrince. I have a tale to tell to the conqueror, Cetewayo.\"\n\nI stared. I rubbed my eyes. It could not be--yes, it was--Umbezi,\n\"Eater-up-of-Elephants,\" the father of Mameena. In a few seconds,\nwithout waiting for leave to approach, he had bounded through the line\nof dead princes, stopping to kick one of them on the head and address\nhis poor clay in some words of shameful insult, and was prancing about\nbefore Cetewayo, shouting his praises.\n\n\"Who is this umfokazana?\" [that is, low fellow] growled the Prince. \"Bid\nhim cease his noise and speak, lest he should be silent for ever.\"\n\n\"O Calf of the Black Cow, I am Umbezi, 'Eater-up-of-Elephants,' chief\ncaptain of Saduko the Cunning, he who won you the battle, father of\nMameena the Beautiful, whom Saduko wed and whom the dead dog, Umbelazi,\nstole away from him.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Cetewayo, screwing up his eyes in a fashion he had when\nhe meant mischief, which among the Zulus caused him to be named the\n\"Bull-who-shuts-his-eyes-to-toss,\" \"and what have you to tell me,\n'Eater-up-of-Elephants' and father of Mameena, whom the dead dog,\nUmbelazi, took away from your master, Saduko the Cunning?\"\n\n\"This, O Mighty One; this, O Shaker of the Earth, that well am I named\n'Eater-up-of-Elephants,' who have eaten up Indhlovu-ene-Sihlonti--the\nElephant himself.\"\n\nNow Saduko seemed to awake from his brooding and started from his place;\nbut Cetewayo sharply bade him be silent, whereon Umbezi, the fool,\nnoting nothing, continued his tale.\n\n\"O Prince, I met Umbelazi in the battle, and when he saw me he fled from\nme; yes, his heart grew soft as water at the sight of me, the warrior\nwhom he had wronged, whose daughter he had stolen.\"\n\n\"I hear you,\" said Cetewayo. \"Umbelazi's heart turned to water at the\nsight of you because he had wronged you--you who until this morning,\nwhen you deserted him with Saduko, were one of his jackals. Well, and\nwhat happened then?\"\n\n\"He fled, O Lion with the Black Mane; he fled like the wind, and I, I\nflew after him like--a stronger wind. Far into the bush he fled, till at\nlength he came to a rock above the river and was obliged to stand. Then\nthere we fought. He thrust at me, but I leapt over his spear _thus_,\"\nand he gambolled into the air. \"He thrust at me again, but I bent myself\n_thus_,\" and he ducked his great head. \"Then he grew tired and my time\ncame. He turned and ran round the rock, and I, I ran after him, stabbing\nhim through the back, _thus_, and _thus_, and _thus_, till he fell,\ncrying for mercy, and rolled off the rock into the river; and as he\nrolled I snatched away his plume. See, is it not the plume of the dead\ndog Umbelazi?\"\n\nCetewayo took the ornament and examined it, showing it to one or two of\nthe captains near him, who nodded their heads gravely.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"this is the war plume of Umbelazi, beloved of the King,\nstrong and shining pillar of the Great House; we know it well, that war\nplume at the sight of which many a knee has loosened. And so you killed\nhim, 'Eater-up-of-Elephants,' father of Mameena, you who this morning\nwere one of the meanest of his jackals. Now, what reward shall I give\nyou for this mighty deed, O Umbezi?\"\n\n\"A great reward, O Terrible One,\" began Umbezi, but in an awful voice\nCetewayo bade him be silent.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"a great reward. Hearken, Jackal and Traitor. Your own\nwords bear witness against you. You, _you_ have dared to lift your hand\nagainst the blood-royal, and with your foul tongue to heap lies and\ninsults upon the name of the mighty dead.\"\n\nNow, understanding at last, Umbezi began to babble excuses, yes, and to\ndeclare that all his tale was false. His fat cheeks fell in, he sank to\nhis knees.\n\nBut Cetewayo only spat towards the man, after his fashion when enraged,\nand looked round him till his eye fell upon Saduko.\n\n\"Saduko,\" he said, \"take away this slayer of the Prince, who boasts that\nhe is red with my own blood, and when he is dead cast him into the river\nfrom that rock on which he says he stabbed Panda's son.\"\n\nSaduko looked round him wildly and hesitated.\n\n\"Take him away,\" thundered Cetewayo, \"and return ere dark to make report\nto me.\"\n\nThen, at a sign from the Prince, soldiers flung themselves upon the\nmiserable Umbezi and dragged him thence, Saduko going with them; nor was\nthe poor liar ever seen again. As he passed by me he called to me, for\nMameena's sake, to save him; but I could only shake my head and bethink\nme of the warning I had once given to him as to the fate of traitors.\n\nIt may be said that this story comes straight from the history of Saul\nand David, but I can only answer that it happened. Circumstances that\nwere not unlike ended in a similar tragedy, that is all. What David's\nexact motives were, naturally I cannot tell; but it is easy to guess\nthose of Cetewayo, who, although he could make war upon his brother to\nsecure the throne, did not think it wise to let it go abroad that the\nroyal blood might be lightly spilt. Also, knowing that I was a witness\nof the Prince's death, he was well aware that Umbezi was but a\nboastful liar who hoped thus to ingratiate himself with an all-powerful\nconqueror.\n\nWell, this tragic incident had its sequel. It seems--to his honour, be\nit said--that Saduko refused to be the executioner of his father-in-law,\nUmbezi; so those with him performed this office and brought him back a\nprisoner to Cetewayo.\n\nWhen the Prince learned that his direct order, spoken in the accustomed\nand fearful formula of _\"Take him away,\"_ had been disobeyed, his rage\nwas, or seemed to be, great. My own conviction is that he was only\nseeking a cause of quarrel against Saduko, who, he thought, was a very\npowerful man, who would probably treat him, should opportunity arise, as\nhe had treated Umbelazi, and perhaps now that the most of Panda's sons\nwere dead, except himself and the lads M'tonga, Sikota and M'kungo, who\nhad fled into Natal, might even in future days aspire to the throne\nas the husband of the King's daughter. Still, he was afraid or did not\nthink it politic at once to put out of his path this master of many\nlegions, who had played so important a part in the battle. Therefore he\nordered him to be kept under guard and taken back to Nodwengu, that the\nwhole matter might be investigated by Panda the King, who still ruled\nthe land, though henceforth only in name. Also he refused to allow me to\ndepart into Natal, saying that I, too, must come to Nodwengu, as there\nmy testimony might be needed.\n\nSo, having no choice, I went, it being fated that I should see the end\nof the drama.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. MAMEENA CLAIMS THE KISS\n\n\nWhen I reached Nodwengu I was taken ill and laid up in my wagon for\nabout a fortnight. What my exact sickness was I do not know, for I had\nno doctor at hand to tell me, as even the missionaries had fled the\ncountry. Fever resulting from fatigue, exposure and excitement, and\ncomplicated with fearful headache--caused, I presume, by the blow which\nI received in the battle--were its principal symptoms.\n\nWhen I began to get better, Scowl and some Zulu friends who came to see\nme informed me that the whole land was in a fearful state of disorder,\nand that Umbelazi's adherents, the Isigqosa, were still being hunted\nout and killed. It seems that it was even suggested by some of the\nUsutu that I should share their fate, but on this point Panda was firm.\nIndeed, he appears to have said publicly that whoever lifted a spear\nagainst me, his friend and guest, lifted it against him, and would be\nthe cause of a new war. So the Usutu left me alone, perhaps because they\nwere satisfied with fighting for a while, and thought it wisest to be\ncontent with what they had won.\n\nIndeed, they had won everything, for Cetewayo was now supreme--by right\nof the assegai--and his father but a cipher. Although he remained the\n\"Head\" of the nation, Cetewayo was publicly declared to be its \"Feet,\"\nand strength was in these active \"Feet,\" not in the bowed and sleeping\n\"Head.\" In fact, so little power was left to Panda that he could not\nprotect his own household. Thus one day I heard a great tumult and\nshouting proceeding apparently from the Isigodhlo, or royal enclosure,\nand on inquiring what it was afterwards, was told that Cetewayo had come\nfrom the Amangwe kraal and denounced Nomantshali, the King's wife,\nas \"umtakati\", or a witch. More, in spite of his father's prayers and\ntears, he had caused her to be put to death before his eyes--a dreadful\nand a savage deed. At this distance of time I cannot remember whether\nNomantshali was the mother of Umbelazi or of one of the other fallen\nprinces.[*]\n\n     [*--On re-reading this history it comes back to me that she\n     was the mother of M'tonga, who was much younger than\n     Umbelazi. --A. Q.]\n\nA few days later, when I was up and about again, although I had not\nventured into the kraal, Panda sent a messenger to me with a present of\nan ox. On his behalf this man congratulated me on my recovery, and told\nme that, whatever might have happened to others, I was to have no fear\nfor my own safety. He added that Cetewayo had sworn to the King that not\na hair of my head should be harmed, in these words:\n\n\"Had I wished to kill Watcher-by-Night because he fought against me, I\ncould have done so down at Endondakusuka; but then I ought to kill you\nalso, my father, since you sent him thither against his will with your\nown regiment. But I like him well, who is brave and who brought me good\ntidings that the Prince, my enemy, was dead of a broken heart. Moreover,\nI wish to have no quarrel with the White House [the English] on account\nof Macumazahn, so tell him that he may sleep in peace.\"\n\nThe messenger said further that Saduko, the husband of the King's\ndaughter, Nandie, and Umbelazi's chief induna, was to be put upon his\ntrial on the morrow before the King and his council, together with\nMameena, daughter of Umbezi, and that my presence was desired at this\ntrial.\n\nI asked what was the charge against them. He replied that, so far as\nSaduko was concerned, there were two: first, that he had stirred up\ncivil war in the land, and, secondly, that having pushed on Umbelazi\ninto a fight in which many thousands perished, he had played the\ntraitor, deserting him in the midst of the battle, with all his\nfollowing--a very heinous offence in the eyes of Zulus, to whatever\nparty they may belong.\n\nAgainst Mameena there were three counts of indictment. First, that it\nwas she who had poisoned Saduko's child and others, not Masapo, her\nfirst husband, who had suffered for that crime. Secondly, that she had\ndeserted Saduko, her second husband, and gone to live with another man,\nnamely, the late Prince Umbelazi. Thirdly, that she was a witch, who had\nenmeshed Umbelazi in the web of her sorceries and thereby caused him to\naspire to the succession to the throne, to which he had no right, and\nmade the isililo, or cry of mourning for the dead, to be heard in every\nkraal in Zululand.\n\n\"With three such pitfalls in her narrow path, Mameena will have to walk\ncarefully if she would escape them all,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, Inkoosi, especially as the pitfalls are dug from side to side of\nthe path and have a pointed stake set at the bottom of each of them. Oh,\nMameena is already as good as dead, as she deserves to be, who without\ndoubt is the greatest umtakati north of the Tugela.\"\n\nI sighed, for somehow I was sorry for Mameena, though why she should\nescape when so many better people had perished because of her I did not\nknow; and the messenger went on:\n\n\"The Black One [that is, Panda] sent me to tell Saduko that he would be\nallowed to see you, Macumazahn, before the trial, if he wished, for he\nknew that you had been a friend of his, and thought that you might be\nable to give evidence in his favour.\"\n\n\"And what did Saduko say to that?\" I asked.\n\n\"He said that he thanked the King, but that it was not needful for him\nto talk with Macumazahn, whose heart was white like his skin, and whose\nlips, if they spoke at all, would tell neither more nor less than the\ntruth. The Princess Nandie, who is with him--for she will not leave\nhim in his trouble, as all others have done--on hearing these words of\nSaduko's, said that they were true, and that for this reason, although\nyou were her friend, she did not hold it necessary to see you either.\"\n\nUpon this intimation I made no comment, but \"my head thought,\" as the\nnatives say, that Saduko's real reason for not wishing to see me was\nthat he felt ashamed to do so, and Nandie's that she feared to learn\nmore about her husband's perfidies than she knew already.\n\n\"With Mameena it is otherwise,\" went on the messenger, \"for as soon\nas she was brought here with Zikali the Little and Wise, with whom, it\nseems, she has been sheltering, and learned that you, Macumazahn, were\nat the kraal, she asked leave to see you--\"\n\n\"And is it granted?\" I broke in hurriedly, for I did not at all wish for\na private interview with Mameena.\n\n\"Nay, have no fear, Inkoosi,\" replied the messenger with a smile; \"it\nis refused, because the King said that if once she saw you she would\nbewitch you and bring trouble on you, as she does on all men. It is for\nthis reason that she is guarded by women only, no man being allowed to\ngo near to her, for on women her witcheries will not bite. Still, they\nsay that she is merry, and laughs and sings a great deal, declaring that\nher life has been dull up at old Zikali's, and that now she is going to\na place as gay as the veld in spring, after the first warm rain, where\nthere will be plenty of men to quarrel for her and make her great and\nhappy. That is what she says, the witch who knows perhaps what the Place\nof Spirits is like.\"\n\nThen, as I made no remarks or suggestions, the messenger departed,\nsaying that he would return on the morrow to lead me to the place of\ntrial.\n\nNext morning, after the cows had been milked and the cattle loosed from\ntheir kraals, he came accordingly, with a guard of about thirty men, all\nof them soldiers who had survived the great fight of the Amawombe. These\nwarriors, some of whom had wounds that were scarcely healed, saluted me\nwith loud cries of \"Inkoosi!\" and \"Baba\" as I stepped out of the wagon,\nwhere I had spent a wretched night of unpleasant anticipation, showing\nme that there were at least some Zulus with whom I remained popular.\nIndeed, their delight at seeing me, whom they looked upon as a comrade\nand one of the few survivors of the great adventure, was quite touching.\nAs we went, which we did slowly, their captain told me of their fears\nthat I had been killed with the others, and how rejoiced they were when\nthey learned that I was safe. He told me also that, after the third\nregiment had attacked them and broken up their ring, a small body of\nthem, from eighty to a hundred only, managed to cut a way through and\nescape, running, not towards the Tugela, where so many thousands had\nperished, but up to Nodwengu, where they reported themselves to Panda as\nthe only survivors of the Amawombe.\n\n\"And are you safe now?\" I asked of the captain.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" he answered. \"You see, we were the King's men, not\nUmbelazi's, so Cetewayo bears us no grudge. Indeed, he is obliged to us,\nbecause we gave the Usutu their stomachs full of good fighting, which\nis more than did those cows of Umbelazi's. It is towards Saduko that\nhe bears a grudge, for you know, my father, one should never pull a\ndrowning man out of the stream--which is what Saduko did, for had it not\nbeen for his treachery, Cetewayo would have sunk beneath the water of\nDeath--especially if it is only to spite a woman who hates him. Still,\nperhaps Saduko will escape with his life, because he is Nandie's\nhusband, and Cetewayo fears Nandie, his sister, if he does not love her.\nBut here we are, and those who have to watch the sky all day will be\nable to tell of the evening weather\" (in other words, those who live\nwill learn).\n\nAs he spoke we passed into the private enclosure of the isi-gohlo,\noutside of which a great many people were gathered, shouting, talking\nand quarrelling, for in those days all the usual discipline of the Great\nPlace was relaxed. Within the fence, however, that was strongly guarded\non its exterior side, were only about a score of councillors, the\nKing, the Prince Cetewayo, who sat upon his right, the Princess Nandie,\nSaduko's wife, a few attendants, two great, silent fellows armed with\nclubs, whom I guessed to be executioners, and, seated in the shade in a\ncorner, that ancient dwarf, Zikali, though how he came to be there I did\nnot know.\n\nObviously the trial was to be quite a private affair, which accounted\nfor the unusual presence of the two \"slayers.\" Even my Amawombe guard\nwas left outside the gate, although I was significantly informed that if\nI chose to call upon them they would hear me, which was another way of\nsaying that in such a small gathering I was absolutely safe.\n\nWalking forward boldly towards Panda, who, though he was as fat as ever,\nlooked very worn and much older than when I had last seen him, I made\nmy bow, whereon he took my hand and asked after my health. Then I shook\nCetewayo's hand also, as I saw that it was stretched out to me. He\nseized the opportunity to remark that he was told that I had suffered\na knock on the head in some scrimmage down by the Tugela, and he hoped\nthat I felt no ill effects. I answered: No, though I feared that there\nwere a few others who had not been so fortunate, especially those who\nhad stumbled against the Amawombe regiment, with whom I chanced to be\ntravelling upon a peaceful mission of inquiry.\n\nIt was a bold speech to make, but I was determined to give him a\nquid pro quo, and, as a matter of fact, he took it in very good part,\nlaughing heartily at the joke.\n\nAfter this I saluted such of the councillors present as I knew, which\nwas not many, for most of my old friends were dead, and sat down upon\nthe stool that was placed for me not very far from the dwarf Zikali, who\nstared at me in a stony fashion, as though he had never seen me before.\n\nThere followed a pause. Then, at some sign from Panda, a side gate in\nthe fence was opened, and through it appeared Saduko, who walked\nproudly to the space in front of the King, to whom he gave the salute\nof \"Bay\u00e9te,\" and, at a sign, sat himself down upon the ground. Next,\nthrough the same gate, to which she was conducted by some women, came\nMameena, quite unchanged and, I think, more beautiful than she had ever\nbeen. So lovely did she look, indeed, in her cloak of grey fur, her\nnecklet of blue beads, and the gleaming rings of copper which she wore\nupon her wrists and ankles, that every eye was fixed upon her as she\nglided gracefully forward to make her obeisance to Panda.\n\nThis done, she turned and saw Nandie, to whom she also bowed, as she\ndid so inquiring after the health of her child. Without waiting for an\nanswer, which she knew would not be vouchsafed, she advanced to me and\ngrasped my hand, which she pressed warmly, saying how glad she was to\nsee me safe after going through so many dangers, though she thought I\nlooked even thinner than I used to be.\n\nOnly of Saduko, who was watching her with his intent and melancholy\neyes, she took no heed whatsoever. Indeed, for a while I thought that\nshe could not have seen him. Nor did she appear to recognise Cetewayo,\nalthough he stared at her hard enough. But, as her glance fell upon the\ntwo executioners, I thought I saw her shudder like a shaken reed. Then\nshe sat down in the place appointed to her, and the trial began.\n\nThe case of Saduko was taken first. An officer learned in Zulu\nlaw--which I can assure the reader is a very intricate and\nwell-established law--I suppose that he might be called a kind of\nattorney-general, rose and stated the case against the prisoner. He told\nhow Saduko, from a nobody, had been lifted to a great place by the\nKing and given his daughter, the Princess Nandie, in marriage. Then he\nalleged that, as would be proved in evidence, the said Saduko had urged\non Umbelazi the Prince, to whose party he had attached himself, to\nmake war upon Cetewayo. This war having begun, at the great battle of\nEndondakusuka, he had treacherously deserted Umbelazi, together with\nthree regiments under his command, and gone over to Cetewayo, thereby\nbringing Umbelazi to defeat and death.\n\nThis brief statement of the case for the prosecution being finished,\nPanda asked Saduko whether he pleaded guilty or not guilty.\n\n\"Guilty, O King,\" he answered, and was silent.\n\nThen Panda asked him if he had anything to say in excuse of his conduct.\n\n\"Nothing, O King, except that I was Umbelazi's man, and when you, O\nKing, had given the word that he and the Prince yonder might fight, I,\nlike many others, some of whom are dead and some alive, worked for him\nwith all my ten fingers that he might have the victory.\"\n\n\"Then why did you desert my son the Prince in the battle?\" asked Panda.\n\n\"Because I saw that the Prince Cetewayo was the stronger bull and wished\nto be on the winning side, as all men do--for no other reason,\" answered\nSaduko calmly.\n\nNow, everyone present stared, not excepting Cetewayo. Panda, who,\nlike the rest of us, had heard a very different tale, looked extremely\npuzzled, while Zikali, in his corner, set up one of his great laughs.\n\nAfter a long pause, at length the King, as supreme judge, began to pass\nsentence. At least, I suppose that was his intention, but before three\nwords had left his lips Nandie rose and said:\n\n\"My Father, ere you speak that which cannot be unspoken, hear me. It is\nwell known that Saduko, my husband, was my brother Umbelazi's general\nand councillor, and if he is to be killed for clinging to the Prince,\nthen I should be killed also, and countless others in Zululand who still\nremain alive because they were not in or escaped the battle. It is well\nknown also, my Father, that during that battle Saduko went over to\nmy brother Cetewayo, though whether this brought about the defeat of\nUmbelazi I cannot say. Why did he go over? He tells you because he\nwished to be on the winning side. It is not true. He went over in order\nto be revenged upon Umbelazi, who had taken from him yonder witch\"--and\nshe pointed with her finger at Mameena--\"yonder witch, whom he loved and\nstill loves, and whom even now he would shield, even though to do so\nhe must make his own name shameful. Saduko sinned; I do not deny it,\nmy Father, but there sits the real traitress, red with the blood of\nUmbelazi and with that of thousands of others who have '_tshonile'd_'\n[gone down to keep him company among the ghosts]. Therefore, O King, I\nbeseech you, spare the life of Saduko, my husband, or, if he must die,\nlearn that I, your daughter, will die with him. I have spoken, O King.\"\n\nAnd very proudly and quietly she sat herself down again, waiting for the\nfateful words.\n\nBut those words were not spoken, since Panda only said: \"Let us try the\ncase of this woman, Mameena.\"\n\nThereon the law officer rose again and set out the charges against\nMameena, namely, that it was she who had poisoned Saduko's child, and\nnot Masapo; that, after marrying Saduko, she had deserted him and gone\nto live with the Prince Umbelazi; and that finally she had bewitched the\nsaid Umbelazi and caused him to make civil war in the land.\n\n\"The second charge, if proved, namely, that this woman deserted her\nhusband for another man, is a crime of death,\" broke in Panda abruptly\nas the officer finished speaking; \"therefore, what need is there to hear\nthe first and the third until that is examined. What do you plead to\nthat charge, woman?\"\n\nNow, understanding that the King did not wish to stir up these other\nmatters of murder and witchcraft for some reason of his own, we all\nturned to hear Mameena's answer.\n\n\"O King,\" she said in her low, silvery voice, \"I cannot deny that I left\nSaduko for Umbelazi the Handsome, any more than Saduko can deny that he\nleft Umbelazi the beaten for Cetewayo the conqueror.\"\n\n\"Why did you leave Saduko?\" asked Panda.\n\n\"O King, perhaps because I loved Umbelazi; for was he not called the\nHandsome? Also _you_ know that the Prince, your son, was one to be\nloved.\" Here she paused, looking at poor Panda, who winced. \"Or,\nperhaps, because I wished to be great; for was he not of the Blood\nRoyal, and, had it not been for Saduko, would he not one day have been a\nking? Or, perhaps, because I could no longer bear the treatment that the\nPrincess Nandie dealt out to me; she who was cruel to me and threatened\nto beat me, because Saduko loved my hut better than her own. Ask\nSaduko; he knows more of these matters than I do,\" and she gazed at him\nsteadily. Then she went on: \"How can a woman tell her reasons, O King,\nwhen she never knows them herself?\"--a question at which some of her\nhearers smiled.\n\nNow Saduko rose and said slowly:\n\n\"Hear me, O King, and I will give the reason that Mameena hides. She\nleft me for Umbelazi because I bade her to do so, for I knew that\nUmbelazi desired her, and I wished to tie the cord tighter which bound\nme to one who at that time I thought would inherit the Throne. Also,\nI was weary of Mameena, who quarrelled night and day with the Princess\nNandie, my Inkosikazi.\"\n\nNow Nandie gasped in astonishment (and so did I), but Mameena laughed\nand said:\n\n\"Yes, O King, those were the two real reasons that I had forgotten. I\nleft Saduko because he bade me, as he wished to make a present to the\nPrince. Also, he was tired of me; for many days at a time he would\nscarcely speak to me, because, however kind she might be, I could not\nhelp quarrelling with the Princess Nandie. Moreover, there was another\nreason which I have forgotten: I had no child, and not having any\nchild I did not think it mattered whether I went or stayed. If Saduko\nsearches, he will remember that I told him so, and that he agreed with\nme.\"\n\nAgain she looked at Saduko, who said hurriedly:\n\n\"Yes, yes, I told her so; I told her that I wished for no barren cows in\nmy kraal.\"\n\nNow some of the audience laughed outright, but Panda frowned.\n\n\"It seems,\" he said, \"that my ears are being stuffed with lies, though\nwhich of these two tells them I cannot say. Well, if the woman left the\nman by his own wish, and that his ends might be furthered, as he says,\nhe had put her away, and therefore the fault, if any, is his, not hers.\nSo that charge is ended. Now, woman, what have you to tell us of the\nwitchcraft which it is said you practised upon the Prince who is gone,\nthereby causing him to make war in the land?\"\n\n\"Little that you would wish to hear, O King, or that it would be seemly\nfor me to speak,\" she answered, drooping her head modestly. \"The only\nwitchcraft that ever I practised upon Umbelazi lies here\"--and she\ntouched her beautiful eyes--\"and here\"--and she touched her curving\nlips--\"and in this poor shape of mine which some have thought so fair.\nAs for the war, what had I to do with war, who never spoke to Umbelazi,\nwho was so dear to me\"--and she looked up with tears running down her\nface--\"save of love? O King, is there a man among you all who would\nfear the witcheries of such a one as I; and because the Heavens made me\nbeautiful with the beauty that men must follow, am I also to be killed\nas a sorceress?\"\n\nNow, to this argument neither Panda nor anyone else seemed to find an\nanswer, especially as it was well known that Umbelazi had cherished his\nambition to the succession long before he met Mameena. So that charge\nwas dropped, and the first and greatest of the three proceeded with;\nnamely, that it was she, Mameena, and not her husband, Masapo, who had\nmurdered Nandie's child.\n\nWhen this accusation was made against her, for the first time I saw a\nlittle shade of trouble flit across Mameena's soft eyes.\n\n\"Surely, O King,\" she said, \"that matter was settled long ago, when the\nNdwande, Zikali, the great Nyanga, smelt out Masapo the wizard, he who\nwas my husband, and brought him to his death for this crime. Must I then\nbe tried for it again?\"\n\n\"Not so, woman,\" answered Panda. \"All that Zikali smelt out was the\npoison that wrought the crime, and as some of that poison was found upon\nMasapo, he was killed as a wizard. Yet it may be that it was not he who\nused the poison.\"\n\n\"Then surely the King should have thought of that before he died,\"\nmurmured Mameena. \"But I forget: It is known that Masapo was always\nhostile to the House of Senzangakona.\"\n\nTo this remark Panda made no answer, perhaps because it was\nunanswerable, even in a land where it was customary to kill the supposed\nwizard first and inquire as to his actual guilt afterwards, or not at\nall. Or perhaps he thought it politic to ignore the suggestion that he\nhad been inspired by personal enmity. Only, he looked at his daughter,\nNandie, who rose and said:\n\n\"Have I leave to call a witness on this matter of the poison, my\nFather?\"\n\nPanda nodded, whereon Nandie said to one of the councillors:\n\n\"Be pleased to summon my woman, Nahana, who waits without.\"\n\nThe man went, and presently returned with an elderly female who, it\nappeared, had been Nandie's nurse, and, never having married, owing to\nsome physical defect, had always remained in her service, a person well\nknown and much respected in her humble walk of life.\n\n\"Nahana,\" said Nandie, \"you are brought here that you may repeat to the\nKing and his council a tale which you told to me as to the coming of\na certain woman into my hut before the death of my first-born son, and\nwhat she did there. Say first, is this woman present here?\"\n\n\"Aye, Inkosazana,\" answered Nahana, \"yonder she sits. Who could mistake\nher?\" and she pointed to Mameena, who was listening to every word\nintently, as a dog listens at the mouth of an ant-bear hole when the\nbeast is stirring beneath.\n\n\"Then what of the woman and her deeds?\" asked Panda.\n\n\"Only this, O King. Two nights before the child that is dead was taken\nill, I saw Mameena creep into the hut of the lady Nandie, I who was\nasleep alone in a corner of the big hut out of reach of the light of the\nfire. At the time the lady Nandie was away from the hut with her son.\nKnowing the woman for Mameena, the wife of Masapo, who was on friendly\nterms with the Inkosazana, whom I supposed she had come to visit, I did\nnot declare myself; nor did I take any particular note when I saw her\nsprinkle a little mat upon which the babe, Saduko's son, was wont to\nbe laid, with some medicine, because I had heard her promise to the\nInkosazana a powder which she said would drive away insects. Only, when\nI saw her throw some of this powder into the vessel of warm water that\nstood by the fire, to be used for the washing of the child, and place\nsomething, muttering certain words that I could not catch, in the straw\nof the doorway, I thought it strange, and was about to question her when\nshe left the hut. As it happened, O King, but a little while afterwards,\nbefore one could count ten tens indeed, a messenger came to the hut to\ntell me that my old mother lay dying at her kraal four days' journey\nfrom Nodwengu, and prayed to see me before she died. Then I forgot all\nabout Mameena and the powder, and, running out to seek the Princess\nNandie, I craved her leave to go with the messenger to my mother's\nkraal, which she granted to me, saying that I need not return until my\nmother was buried.\n\n\"So I went. But, oh! my mother took long to die. Whole moons passed\nbefore I shut her eyes, and all this while she would not let me go; nor,\nindeed, did I wish to leave her whom I loved. At length it was over, and\nthen came the days of mourning, and after those some more days of rest,\nand after them again the days of the division of the cattle, so that in\nthe end six moons or more had gone by before I returned to the service\nof the Princess Nandie, and found that Mameena was now the second wife\nof the lord Saduko. Also I found that the child of the lady Nandie was\ndead, and that Masapo, the first husband of Mameena, had been smelt out\nand killed as the murderer of the child. But as all these things were\nover and done with, and as Mameena was very kind to me, giving me gifts\nand sparing me tasks, and as I saw that Saduko my lord loved her much,\nit never came into my head to say anything of the matter of the powder\nthat I saw her sprinkle on the mat.\n\n\"After she had run away with the Prince who is dead, however, I did tell\nthe lady Nandie. Moreover, the lady Nandie, in my presence, searched\nin the straw of the doorway of the hut and found there, wrapped in soft\nhide, certain medicines such as the Nyangas sell, wherewith those who\nconsult them can bewitch their enemies, or cause those whom they desire\nto love them or to hate their wives or husbands. That is all I know of\nthe story, O King.\"\n\n\"Do my ears hear a true tale, Nandie?\" asked Panda. \"Or is this woman a\nliar like others?\"\n\n\"I think not, my Father; see, here is the muti [medicine] which Nahana\nand I found hid in the doorway of the hut that I have kept unopened till\nthis day.\"\n\nAnd she laid on the ground a little leather bag, very neatly sewn with\nsinews, and fastened round its neck with a fibre string.\n\nPanda directed one of the councillors to open the bag, which the man\ndid unwillingly enough, since evidently he feared its evil influence,\npouring out its contents on to the back of a hide shield, which was\nthen carried round so that we might all look at them. These, so far as\nI could see, consisted of some withered roots, a small piece of human\nthigh bone, such as might have come from the skeleton of an infant, that\nhad a little stopper of wood in its orifice, and what I took to be the\nfang of a snake.\n\nPanda looked at them and shrank away, saying:\n\n\"Come hither, Zikali the Old, you who are skilled in magic, and tell us\nwhat is this medicine.\"\n\nThen Zikali rose from the corner where he had been sitting so silently,\nand waddled heavily across the open space to where the shield lay in\nfront of the King. As he passed Mameena, she bent down over the dwarf\nand began to whisper to him swiftly; but he placed his hands upon his\nbig head, covering up his ears, as I suppose, that he might not hear her\nwords.\n\n\"What have I to do with this matter, O King?\" he asked.\n\n\"Much, it seems, O Opener-of-Roads,\" said Panda sternly, \"seeing that\nyou were the doctor who smelt out Masapo, and that it was in your kraal\nthat yonder woman hid herself while her lover, the Prince, my son, who\nis dead, went down to the battle, and that she was brought thence with\nyou. Tell us, now, the nature of this muti, and, being wise, as you are,\nbe careful to tell us truly, lest it should be said, O Zikali, that you\nare not a Nyanga only, but an umtakati as well. For then,\" he added with\nmeaning, and choosing his words carefully, \"perchance, O Zikali, I might\nbe tempted to make trial of whether or no it is true that you cannot\nbe killed like other men, especially as I have heard of late that your\nheart is evil towards me and my House.\"\n\nFor a moment Zikali hesitated--I think to give his quick brain time\nto work, for he saw his great danger. Then he laughed in his dreadful\nfashion and said:\n\n\"Oho! the King thinks that the otter is in the trap,\" and he glanced\nat the fence of the isi-gohlo and at the fierce executioners, who stood\nwatching him sternly. \"Well, many times before has this otter seemed to\nbe in a trap, yes, ere your father saw light, O Son of Senzangakona,\nand after it also. Yet here he stands living. Make no trial, O King, of\nwhether or no I be mortal, lest if Death should come to such a one as I,\nhe should take many others with him also. Have you not heard the saying\nthat when the Opener-of-Roads comes to the end of his road there will be\nno more a King of the Zulus, as when he began his road there was no King\nof the Zulus, since the days of his manhood are the days of _all_ the\nZulu kings?\"\n\nThus he spoke, glaring at Panda and at Cetewayo, who shrank before his\ngaze.\n\n\"Remember,\" he went on, \"that the Black One who is 'gone down' long ago,\nthe Wild Beast who fathered the Zulu herd, threatened him whom he named\nthe 'Thing-that-should-not-have-been-born,' aye, and slew those whom he\nloved, and afterwards was slain by others, who also are 'gone down,'\nand that you alone, O Panda, did not threaten him, and that you alone,\nO Panda, have not been slain. Now, if you would make trial of whether I\ndie as other men die, bid your dogs fall on, for Zikali is ready,\" and\nhe folded his arms and waited.\n\nIndeed, all of us waited breathlessly, for we understood that the\nterrible dwarf was matching himself against Panda and Cetewayo and\ndefying them both. Presently it became obvious that he had won the game,\nsince Panda only said:\n\n\"Why should I slay one whom I have befriended in the past, and why do\nyou speak such heavy words of death in my ears, O, Zikali the Wise,\nwhich of late have heard so much of death?\" He sighed, adding: \"Be\npleased now, to tell us of this medicine, or, if you will not, go, and I\nwill send for other Nyangas.\"\n\n\"Why should I not tell you, when you ask me softly and without threats,\nO King? See\"--and Zikali took up some of the twisted roots--\"these are\nthe roots of a certain poisonous herb that blooms at night on the tops\nof mountains, and woe be to the ox that eats thereof. They have been\nboiled in gall and blood, and ill will befall the hut in which they are\nhidden by one who can speak the words of power. This is the bone of a\nbabe that has never lived to cut its teeth--I think of a babe that was\nleft to die alone in the bush because it was hated, or because none\nwould father it. Such a bone has strength to work ill against other\nbabes; moreover, it is filled with a charmed medicine. Look!\" and,\npulling out the plug of wood, he scattered some grey powder from the\nbone, then stopped it up again. \"This,\" he added, picking up the fang,\n\"is the tooth of a deadly serpent, that, after it has been doctored, is\nused by women to change the heart of a man from another to herself. I\nhave spoken.\"\n\nAnd he turned to go.\n\n\"Stay!\" said the King. \"Who set these foul charms in the doorway of\nSaduko's hut?\"\n\n\"How can I tell, O King, unless I make preparation and cast the bones\nand smell out the evil-doer? You have heard the story of the woman\nNahana. Accept it or reject it as your heart tells you.\"\n\n\"If that story be true, O Zikali, how comes it that you yourself smelt\nout, not Mameena, the wife of Masapo, but Masapo, her husband, himself,\nand caused him to be slain because of the poisoning of the child of\nNandie?\"\n\n\"You err, O King. I, Zikali, smelt out the House of Masapo. Then I\nsmelt out the poison, searching for it first in the hair of Mameena, and\nfinding it in the kaross of Masapo. I never smelt out that it was Masapo\nwho gave the poison. That was the judgment of you and of your Council,\nO King. Nay, I knew well that there was more in the matter, and had you\npaid me another fee and bade me to continue to use my wisdom, without\ndoubt I should have found this magic stuff hidden in the hut, and mayhap\nhave learned the name of the hider. But I was weary, who am very old;\nand what was it to me if you chose to kill Masapo or chose to let him\ngo? Masapo, who, being your secret enemy, was a man who deserved to\ndie--if not for this matter, then for others.\"\n\nNow, all this while I had been watching Mameena, who sat, in the Zulu\nfashion, listening to this deadly evidence, a slight smile upon her\nface, and without attempting any interruption or comment. Only I saw\nthat while Zikali was examining the medicine, her eyes were seeking\nthe eyes of Saduko, who remained in his place, also silent, and, to all\nappearance, the least interested of anyone present. He tried to avoid\nher glance, turning his head uneasily; but at length her eyes caught his\nand held them. Then his heart began to beat quickly, his breast heaved,\nand on his face there grew a look of dreamy content, even of happiness.\nFrom that moment forward, till the end of the scene, Saduko never took\nhis eyes off this strange woman, though I think that, with the exception\nof the dwarf, Zikali, who saw everything, and of myself, who am trained\nto observation, none noted this curious by-play of the drama.\n\nThe King began to speak. \"Mameena,\" he said, \"you have heard. Have\nyou aught to say? For if not it would seem that you are a witch and a\nmurderess, and one who must die.\"\n\n\"Yea, a little word, O King,\" she answered quietly. \"Nahana speaks\ntruth. It is true that I entered the hut of Nandie and set the medicine\nthere. I say it because by nature I am not one who hides the truth or\nwould attempt to throw discredit even upon a humble serving-woman,\" and\nshe glanced at Nahana.\n\n\"Then from between your own teeth it is finished,\" said Panda.\n\n\"Not altogether, O King. I have said that I set the medicine in the hut.\nI have not said, and I will not say, how and why I set it there. That\ntale I call upon Saduko yonder to tell to you, he who was my husband,\nthat I left for Umbelazi, and who, being a man, must therefore hate me.\nBy the words he says I will abide. If he declares that I am guilty, then\nI am guilty, and prepared to pay the price of guilt. But if he declares\nthat I am innocent, then, O King and O Prince Cetewayo, without fear\nI trust myself to your justness. Now speak, O Saduko; speak the whole\ntruth, whatever it may be, if that is the King's will.\"\n\n\"It is my will,\" said Panda.\n\n\"And mine also,\" added Cetewayo, who, I could see, like everyone else,\nwas much interested in this matter.\n\nSaduko rose to his feet, the same Saduko that I had always known, and\nyet so changed. All the life and fire had gone from him; his pride\nin himself was no more; none could have known him for that ambitious,\nconfident man who, in his day of power, the Zulus named the\n\"Self-Eater.\" He was a mere mask of the old Saduko, informed by some\nnew, some alien, spirit. With dull, lack-lustre eyes fixed always upon\nthe lovely eyes of Mameena, in slow and hesitating tones he began his\ntale.\n\n\"It is true, O Lion,\" he said, \"that Mameena spread the poison upon my\nchild's mat. It is true that she set the deadly charms in the doorway of\nNandie's hut. These things she did, not knowing what she did, and it was\nI who instructed her to do them. This is the case. From the beginning I\nhave always loved Mameena as I have loved no other woman and as no other\nwoman was ever loved. But while I was away with Macumazahn, who sits\nyonder, to destroy Bangu, chief of the Amakoba, he who had killed my\nfather, Umbezi, the father of Mameena, he whom the Prince Cetewayo gave\nto the vultures the other day because he had lied as to the death of\nUmbelazi, he, I say, forced Mameena, against her will, to marry Masapo\nthe Boar, who afterwards was executed for wizardry. Now, here at your\nfeast, when you reviewed the people of the Zulus, O King, after you had\ngiven me the lady Nandie as wife, Mameena and I met again and loved each\nother more than we had ever done before. But, being an upright woman,\nMameena thrust me away from her, saying:\n\n\"'I have a husband, who, if he is not dear to me, still is my husband,\nand while he lives to him I will be true.' Then, O King, I took counsel\nwith the evil in my heart, and made a plot in myself to be rid of the\nBoar, Masapo, so that when he was dead I might marry Mameena. This\nwas the plot that I made--that my son and Princess Nandie's should be\npoisoned, and that Masapo should seem to poison him, so that he might be\nkilled as a wizard and I marry Mameena.\"\n\nNow, at this astounding statement, which was something beyond the\nexperience of the most cunning and cruel savage present there, a gasp of\nastonishment went up from the audience; even old Zikali lifted his head\nand stared. Nandie, too, shaken out of her usual calm, rose as though\nto speak; then, looking first at Saduko and next at Mameena, sat herself\ndown again and waited. But Saduko went on again in the same cold,\nmeasured voice:\n\n\"I gave Mameena a powder which I had bought for two heifers from a great\ndoctor who lived beyond the Tugela, but who is now dead, which powder\nI told her was desired by Nandie, my Inkosikazi, to destroy the little\nbeetles than ran about the hut, and directed her where she was to spread\nit. Also, I gave her the bag of medicine, telling her to thrust it into\nthe doorway of the hut, that it might bring a blessing upon my House.\nThese things she did ignorantly to please me, not knowing that the\npowder was poison, not knowing that the medicine was bewitched. So\nmy child died, as I wished it to die, and, indeed, I myself fell sick\nbecause by accident I touched the powder.\n\n\"Afterwards Masapo was smelt out as a wizard by old Zikali, I having\ncaused a bag of the poison to be sewn in his kaross in order to deceive\nZikali, and killed by your order, O King, and Mameena was given to me as\na wife, also by your order, O King, which was what I desired. Later on,\nas I have told you, I wearied of her, and wishing to please the Prince\nwho has wandered away, I commanded her to yield herself to him, which\nMameena did out of her love for me and to advance my fortunes, she who\nis blameless in all things.\"\n\nSaduko finished speaking and sat down again, as an automaton might do\nwhen a wire is pulled, his lack-lustre eyes still fixed upon Mameena's\nface.\n\n\"You have heard, O King,\" said Mameena. \"Now pass judgment, knowing\nthat, if it be your will, I am ready to die for Saduko's sake.\"\n\nBut Panda sprang up in a rage.\n\n_\"Take him away!\"_ he said, pointing to Saduko. \"Take away that dog who\nis not fit to live, a dog who eats his own child that thereby he may\ncause another to be slain unjustly and steal his wife.\"\n\nThe executioners leapt forward, and, having something to say, for I\ncould bear this business no longer, I began to rise to my feet. Before I\ngained them, however, Zikali was speaking.\n\n\"O King,\" he said, \"it seems that you have killed one man unjustly on\nthis matter, namely, Masapo. Would you do the same by another?\" and he\npointed to Saduko.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Panda angrily. \"Have you not heard this\nlow fellow, whom I made great, giving him the rule over tribes and my\ndaughter in marriage, confess with his own lips that he murdered his\nchild, the child of my blood, in order that he might eat a fruit\nwhich grew by the roadside for all men to nibble at?\" and he glared at\nMameena.\n\n\"Aye, Child of Senzangakona,\" answered Zikali, \"I heard Saduko say this\nwith his own lips, but the voice that spoke from the lips was not the\nvoice of Saduko, as, were you a skilled Nyanga like me, you would\nhave known as well as I do, and as well as does the white man,\nWatcher-by-Night, who is a reader of hearts.\n\n\"Hearken now, O King, and you great ones around the King, and I will\ntell you a story. Matiwane, the father of Saduko, was my friend, as he\nwas yours, O King, and when Bangu slew him and his people, by leave of\nthe Wild Beast [Chaka], I saved the child, his son, aye, and brought him\nup in my own House, having learned to love him. Then, when he became a\nman, I, the Opener-of-Roads, showed him two roads, down either of which\nhe might choose to walk--the Road of Wisdom and the Road of War and\nWomen: the white road that runs through peace to knowledge, and the red\nroad that runs through blood to death.\n\n\"But already there stood one upon this red road who beckoned him, she\nwho sits yonder, and he followed after her, as I knew he would. From\nthe beginning she was false to him, taking a richer man for her husband.\nThen, when Saduko grew great, she grew sorry, and came to ask my counsel\nas to how she might be rid of Masapo, whom she swore she hated. I told\nher that she could leave him for another man, or wait till her Spirit\nmoved him from her path; but I never put evil into her heart, seeing\nthat it was there already.\n\n\"Then she and no other, having first made Saduko love her more than\never, murdered the child of Nandie, his Inkosikazi; and so brought\nabout the death of Masapo and crept into Saduko's arms. Here\nshe slept a while, till a new shadow fell upon her, that of the\n'Elephant-with-the-tuft-of-hair,' who will walk the woods no more. Him\nshe beguiled that she might grow great the quicker, and left the house\nof Saduko, taking his heart with her, she who was destined to be the\ndoom of men.\n\n\"Now, into Saduko's breast, where his heart had been, entered an evil\nspirit of jealousy and of revenge, and in the battle of Endondakusuka\nthat spirit rode him as a white man rides a horse. As he had arranged\nto do with the Prince Cetewayo yonder--nay, deny it not, O Prince, for I\nknow all; did you not make a bargain together, on the third night before\nthe battle, among the bushes, and start apart when the buck leapt out\nbetween you?\" (Here Cetewayo, who had been about to speak, threw the\ncorner of his kaross over his face.) \"As he had arranged to do, I say,\nhe went over with his regiments from the Isigqosa to the Usutu, and so\nbrought about the fall of Umbelazi and the death of many thousands. Yes,\nand this he did for one reason only--because yonder woman had left him\nfor the Prince, and he cared more for her than for all the world could\ngive him, for her who had filled him with madness as a bowl is filled\nwith milk. And now, O King, you have heard this man tell you a story,\nyou have heard him shout out that he is viler than any man in all the\nland; that he murdered his own child, the child he loved so well, to win\nthis witch; that afterwards he gave her to his friend and lord to buy\nmore of his favour, and that lastly he deserted that lord because he\nthought that there was another lord from whom he could buy more favour.\nIs it not so, O King?\"\n\n\"It is so,\" answered Panda, \"and therefore must Saduko be thrown out to\nthe jackals.\"\n\n\"Wait a while, O King. I say that Saduko has spoken not with his own\nvoice, but with the voice of Mameena. I say that she is the greatest\nwitch in all the land, and that she has drugged him with the medicine\nof her eyes, so that he knows not what he says, even as she drugged the\nPrince who is dead.\"\n\n\"Then prove it, or he dies!\" exclaimed the King.\n\nNow the dwarf went to Panda and whispered in his ear, whereon Panda\nwhispered in turn into the ears of two of his councillors. These men,\nwho were unarmed, rose and made as though to leave the isi-gohlo. But\nas they passed Mameena one of them suddenly threw his arms about her,\npinioning her arms, the other tearing off the kaross he wore--for the\nweather was cold--flung it over her head and knotted it behind her so\nthat she was hidden except for her ankles and feet. Then, although she\ndid not move or struggle, they caught hold of her and stood still.\n\nNow Zikali hobbled to Saduko and bade him rise, which he did. Then he\nlooked at him for a long while and made certain movements with his hands\nbefore his face, after which Saduko uttered a great sigh and stared\nabout him.\n\n\"Saduko,\" said Zikali, \"I pray you tell me, your foster-father, whether\nit is true, as men say, that you sold your wife, Mameena, to the Prince\nUmbelazi in order that his favour might fall on you like heavy rain?\"\n\n\"Wow! Zikali,\" said Saduko, with a start of rage, \"If were you as others\nare I would kill you, you toad, who dare to spit slander on my name.\nShe ran away with the Prince, having beguiled him with the magic of her\nbeauty.\"\n\n\"Strike me not, Saduko,\" went on Zikali, \"or at least wait to strike\nuntil you have answered one more question. Is it true, as men say, that\nin the battle of Endondakusuka you went over to the Usutu with your\nregiments because you thought that Indhlovu-ene-Sihlonti would be\nbeaten, and wished to be on the side of him who won?\"\n\n\"What, Toad! More slander?\" cried Saduko. \"I went over for one reason\nonly--to be revenged upon the Prince because he had taken from me\nher who was more to me than life or honour. Aye, and when I went over\nUmbelazi was winning; it was because I went that he lost and died, as I\nmeant that he should die, though now,\" he added sadly, \"I would that I\nhad not brought him to ruin and the dust, who think that, like myself,\nhe was but wet clay in a woman's fingers.\n\n\"O King,\" he added, turning to Panda, \"kill me, I pray you, who am not\nworthy to live, since to him whose hand is red with the blood of his\nfriend, death alone is left, who, while he breathes, must share his\nsleep with ghosts that watch him with their angry eyes.\"\n\nThen Nandie sprang up and said:\n\n\"Nay, Father, listen not to him who is mad, and therefore holy.[*]\nWhat he has done, he has done, who, as he has said, was but a tool in\nanother's hand. As for our babe, I know well that he would have died\nsooner than harm it, for he loved it much, and when it was taken away,\nfor three whole days and nights he wept and would touch no food. Give\nthis poor man to me, my Father--to me, his wife, who loves him--and let\nus go hence to some other land, where perchance we may forget.\"\n\n     [*--The Zulus suppose that insane people are inspired.\n      --A.Q.]\n\n\"Be silent, daughter,\" said the King; \"and you, O Zikali, the Nyanga, be\nsilent also.\"\n\nThey obeyed, and, after thinking awhile, Panda made a motion with his\nhand, whereon the two councillors lifted the kaross from off Mameena,\nwho looked about her calmly and asked if she were taking part in some\nchild's game.\n\n\"Aye, woman,\" answered Panda, \"you are taking part in a great game, but\nnot, I think, such as is played by children--a game of life and death.\nNow, have you heard the tale of Zikali the Little and Wise, and the\nwords of Saduko, who was once your husband, or must they be repeated to\nyou?\"\n\n\"There is no need, O King; my ears are too quick to be muffled by a fur\nbag, and I would not waste your time.\"\n\n\"Then what have you to say, woman?\"\n\n\"Not much,\" she answered with a shrug of her shoulders, \"except that I\nhave lost in this game. You will not believe me, but if you had left me\nalone I should have told you so, who did not wish to see that poor fool,\nSaduko, killed for deeds he had never done. Still, the tale he told you\nwas not told because I had bewitched him; it was told for love of me,\nwhom he desired to save. It was Zikali yonder; Zikali, the enemy of your\nHouse, who in the end will destroy your House, O Son of Senzangakona,\nthat bewitched him, as he has bewitched you all, and forced the truth\nout of his unwilling heart.\n\n\"Now, what more is there to say? Very little, as I think. I did the\nthings that are laid to my charge, and worse things which have not been\nstated. Oh, I played for great stakes, I, who meant to be the Inkosazana\nof the Zulus, and, as it chances, by the weight of a hair I have lost.\nI thought that I had counted everything, but the hair's weight which\nturned the balance against me was the mad jealousy of this fool, Saduko,\nupon which I had not reckoned. I see now that when I left Saduko I\nshould have left him dead. Thrice I had thought of it. Once I mixed the\npoison in his drink, and then he came in, weary with his plottings, and\nkissed me ere he drank; and my woman's heart grew soft and I overset the\nbowl that was at his lips. Do you not remember, Saduko?\n\n\"So, so! For that folly alone I deserve to die, for she who would\nreign\"--and her beautiful eyes flashed royally--\"must have a tiger's\nheart, not that of a woman. Well, because I was too kind I must die;\nand, after all is said, it is well to die, who go hence awaited by\nthousands upon thousands that I have sent before me, and who shall be\ngreeted presently by your son, Indhlovu-ene-Sihlonti, and his warriors,\ngreeted as the Inkosazana of Death, with red, lifted spears and with the\nroyal salute!\n\n\"Now, I have spoken. Walk your little road, O King and Prince and\nCouncillors, till you reach the gulf into which I sink, that yawns for\nall of you. O King, when you meet me again at the bottom of that gulf,\nwhat a tale you will have to tell me, you who are but the shadow of a\nking, you whose heart henceforth must be eaten out by a worm that is\ncalled _Love-of-the-Lost_. O Prince and Conqueror Cetewayo, what a tale\nyou will have to tell me when I greet you at the bottom of that gulf,\nyou who will bring your nation to a wreck and at last die as I must\ndie--only the servant of others and by the will of others. Nay, ask me\nnot how. Ask old Zikali, my master, who saw the beginning of your House\nand will see its end. Oh, yes, as you say, I am a witch, and I know, I\nknow! Come, I am spent. You men weary me, as men have always done, being\nbut fools whom it is so easy to make drunk, and who when drunk are so\nunpleasing. Piff! I am tired of you sober and cunning, and I am tired of\nyou drunken and brutal, you who, after all, are but beasts of the field\nto whom Mvelingangi, the Creator, has given heads which can think, but\nwhich always think wrong.\n\n\"Now, King, before you unchain your dogs upon me, I ask one moment.\nI said that I hated all men, yet, as you know, no woman can tell the\ntruth--quite. There is a man whom I do not hate, whom I never hated,\nwhom I think I love because he would not love me. He sits there,\" and to\nmy utter dismay, and the intense interest of that company, she pointed\nat me, Allan Quatermain!\n\n\"Well, once by my 'magic,' of which you have heard so much, I got the\nbetter of this man against his will and judgment, and, because of that\nsoft heart of mine, I let him go; yes, I let the rare fish go when he\nwas on my hook. It is well that I should have let him go, since, had I\nkept him, a fine story would have been spoiled and I should have become\nnothing but a white hunter's servant, to be thrust away behind the door\nwhen the white Inkosikazi came to eat his meat--I, Mameena, who never\nloved to stand out of sight behind a door. Well, when he was at my feet\nand I spared him, he made me a promise, a very small promise, which yet\nI think he will keep now when we part for a little while. Macumazahn,\ndid you not promise to kiss me once more upon the lips whenever and\nwherever I should ask you?\"\n\n\"I did,\" I answered in a hollow voice, for in truth her eyes held me as\nthey had held Saduko.\n\n\"Then come now, Macumazahn, and give me that farewell kiss. The King\nwill permit it, and since I have now no husband, who take Death to\nhusband, there is none to say you nay.\"\n\nI rose. It seemed to me that I could not help myself. I went to her,\nthis woman surrounded by implacable enemies, this woman who had played\nfor great stakes and lost them, and who knew so well how to lose. I\nstood before her, ashamed and yet not ashamed, for something of her\ngreatness, evil though it might be, drove out my shame, and I knew that\nmy foolishness was lost in a vast tragedy.\n\nSlowly she lifted her languid arm and threw it about my neck; slowly she\nbent her red lips to mine and kissed me, once upon the mouth and once\nupon the forehead. But between those two kisses she did a thing so\nswiftly that my eyes could scarcely follow what she did. It seemed to\nme that she brushed her left hand across her lips, and that I saw her\nthroat rise as though she swallowed something. Then she thrust me from\nher, saying:\n\n\"Farewell, O Macumazana, you will never forget this kiss of mine; and\nwhen we meet again we shall have much to talk of, for between now and\nthen your story will be long. Farewell, Zikali. I pray that all your\nplannings may succeed, since those you hate are those I hate, and I\nbear you no grudge because you told the truth at last. Farewell, Prince\nCetewayo. You will never be the man your brother would have been, and\nyour lot is very evil, you who are doomed to pull down a House built\nby One who was great. Farewell, Saduko the fool, who threw away your\nfortune for a woman's eyes, as though the world were not full of women.\nNandie the Sweet and the Forgiving will nurse you well until your\nhaunted end. Oh! why does Umbelazi lean over your shoulder, Saduko, and\nlook at me so strangely? Farewell, Panda the Shadow. Now let loose your\nslayers. Oh! let them loose swiftly, lest they should be balked of my\nblood!\"\n\nPanda lifted his hand and the executioners leapt forward, but ere\never they reached her, Mameena shivered, threw wide her arms and fell\nback--dead. The poisonous drug she had taken worked well and swiftly.\n\n\nSuch was the end of Mameena, Child of Storm.\n\n\nA deep silence followed, a silence of awe and wonderment, till suddenly\nit was broken by a sound of dreadful laughter. It came from the lips\nof Zikali the Ancient, Zikali, the\n\n\"Thing-that-should-never-have-been-born.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. MAMEENA--MAMEENA--MAMEENA!\n\n\nThat evening at sunset, just as I was about to trek, for the King had\ngiven me leave to go, and at that time my greatest desire in life\nseemed to be to bid good-bye to Zululand and the Zulus--I saw a strange,\nbeetle-like shape hobbling up the hill towards me, supported by two big\nmen. It was Zikali.\n\nHe passed me without a word, merely making a motion that I was to follow\nhim, which I did out of curiosity, I suppose, for Heaven knows I had\nseen enough of the old wizard to last me for a lifetime. He reached a\nflat stone about a hundred yards above my camp, where there was no bush\nin which anyone could hide, and sat himself down, pointing to another\nstone in front of him, on which I sat myself down. Then the two men\nretired out of earshot, and, indeed, of sight, leaving us quite alone.\n\n\"So you are going away, O Macumazana?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, I am,\" I answered with energy, \"who, if I could have had my will,\nwould have gone away long ago.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I know that; but it would have been a great pity, would it\nnot? If you had gone, Macumazahn, you would have missed seeing the end\nof a strange little story, and you, who love to study the hearts of men\nand women, would not have been so wise as you are to-day.\"\n\n\"No, nor as sad, Zikali. Oh! the death of that woman!\" And I put my hand\nbefore my eyes.\n\n\"Ah! I understand, Macumazahn; you were always fond of her, were you\nnot, although your white pride would not suffer you to admit that black\nfingers were pulling at your heartstrings? She was a wonderful witch,\nwas Mameena; and there is this comfort for you--that she pulled at other\nheartstrings as well. Masapo's, for instance; Saduko's, for instance;\nUmbelazi's, for instance, none of whom got any luck from her\npulling--yes, and even at mine.\"\n\nNow, as I did not think it worth while to contradict his nonsense so far\nas I was concerned personally, I went off on this latter point.\n\n\"If you show affection as you did towards Mameena to-day, Zikali, I pray\nmy Spirit that you may cherish none for me,\" I said.\n\nHe shook his great head pityingly as he answered:\n\n\"Did you never love a lamb and kill it afterwards when you were hungry,\nor when it grew into a ram and butted you, or when it drove away your\nother sheep, so that they fell into the hands of thieves? Now, I am very\nhungry for the fall of the House of Senzangakona, and the lamb, Mameena,\nhaving grown big, nearly laid me on my back to-day within the reach of\nthe slayer's spear. Also, she was hunting my sheep, Saduko, into an evil\nnet whence he could never have escaped. So, somewhat against my will, I\nwas driven to tell the truth of that lamb and her tricks.\"\n\n\"I daresay,\" I exclaimed; \"but, at any rate, she is done with, so what\nis the use of talking about her?\"\n\n\"Ah! Macumazahn, she is done with, or so you think, though that is a\nstrange saying for a white man who believes in much that we do not know;\nbut at least her work remains, and it has been a great work. Consider\nnow. Umbelazi and most of the princes, and thousands upon thousands\nof the Zulus, whom I, the Dwande, hate, dead, dead! _Mameena's work_,\nMacumazahn! Panda's hand grown strengthless with sorrow and his eyes\nblind with tears. _Mameena's work_, Macumazahn! Cetewayo, king in all\nbut name; Cetewayo, who shall bring the House of Senzangakona to the\ndust. _Mameena's work_, Macumazahn! Oh! a mighty work. Surely she has\nlived a great and worthy life, and she died a great and worthy death!\nAnd how well she did it! Had you eyes to see her take the poison which I\ngave her--a good poison, was it not?--between her kisses, Macumazahn?\"\n\n\"I believe it was your work, and not hers,\" I blurted out, ignoring\nhis mocking questions. \"You pulled the strings; you were the wind that\ncaused the grass to bend till the fire caught it and set the town in\nflames--the town of your foes.\"\n\n\"How clever you are, Macumazahn! If your wits grow so sharp, one day\nthey will cut your throat, as, indeed, they have nearly done several\ntimes already. Yes, yes, I know how to pull strings till the trap falls,\nand to blow grass until the flame catches it, and how to puff at that\nflame until it burns the House of Kings. And yet this trap would have\nfallen without me, only then it might have snared other rats; and this\ngrass would have caught fire if I had not blown, only then it might have\nburnt another House. I did not make these forces, Macumazahn; I did but\nguide them towards a great end, for which the White House [that is, the\nEnglish] should thank me one day.\" He brooded a while, then went on:\n\"But what need is there to talk to you of these matters, Macumazahn,\nseeing that in a time to come you will have your share in them and see\nthem for yourself? After they are finished, then we will talk.\"\n\n\"I do not wish to talk of them,\" I answered. \"I have said so already.\nBut for what other purpose did you take the trouble to come here?\"\n\n\"Oh, to bid you farewell for a little while, Macumazahn. Also to tell\nyou that Panda, or rather Cetewayo, for now Panda is but his Voice,\nsince the Head must go where the Feet carry it, has spared Saduko at the\nprayer of Nandie and banished him from the land, giving him his cattle\nand any people who care to go with him to wherever he may choose to live\nfrom henceforth. At least, Cetewayo says it was at Nandie's prayer,\nand at mine and yours, but what he means is that, after all that has\nhappened, he thought it wise that Saduko should die of himself.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that he should kill himself, Zikali?\"\n\n\"No, no; I mean that his own idhlozi, his Spirit, should be left to kill\nhim, which it will do in time. You see, Macumazahn, Saduko is now living\nwith a ghost, which he calls the ghost of Umbelazi, whom he betrayed.\"\n\n\"Is that your way of saying he is mad, Zikali?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, he lives with a ghost, or the ghost lives in him, or he is\nmad--call it which you will. The mad have a way of living with ghosts,\nand ghosts have a way of sharing their food with the mad. Now you\nunderstand everything, do you not?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" I answered; \"it is as plain as the sun.\"\n\n\"Oh! did I not say you were clever, Macumazahn, you who know where\nmadness ends and ghosts begin, and why they are just the same thing?\nWell, the sun is no longer plain. Look, it has sunk; and you would be on\nyour road who wish to be far from Nodwengu before morning. You will pass\nthe plain of Endondakusuka, will you not, and cross the Tugela by the\ndrift? Have a look round, Macumazahn, and see if you can recognise any\nold friends. Umbezi, the knave and traitor, for instance; or some of the\nprinces. If so, I should like to send them a message. What! You cannot\nwait? Well, then, here is a little present for you, some of my own work.\nOpen it when it is light again, Macumazahn; it may serve to remind you\nof the strange little tale of Mameena with the Heart of Fire. I wonder\nwhere she is now? Sometimes, sometimes--\" And he rolled his great eyes\nabout him and sniffed at the air like a hound. \"Farewell till we meet\nagain. Farewell, Macumazahn. Oh! if you had only run away with Mameena,\nhow different things might have been to-day!\"\n\nI jumped up and fled from that terrible old dwarf, whom I verily\nbelieve-- No; where is the good of my saying what I believe? I fled from\nhim, leaving him seated on the stone in the shadows, and as I fled, out\nof the darkness behind me there arose the sound of his loud and eerie\nlaughter.\n\nNext morning I opened the packet which he had given me, after wondering\nonce or twice whether I should not thrust it down an ant-bear hole as it\nwas. But this, somehow, I could not find the heart to do, though now I\nwish I had. Inside, cut from the black core of the umzimbiti wood, with\njust a little of the white sap left on it to mark the eyes, teeth and\nnails, was a likeness of Mameena. Of course, it was rudely executed, but\nit was--or rather is, for I have it still--a wonderfully good portrait\nof her, for whether Zikali was or was not a wizard, he was certainly\na good artist. There she stands, her body a little bent, her arms\noutstretched, her head held forward with the lips parted, just as though\nshe were about to embrace somebody, and in one of her hands, cut also\nfrom the white sap of the umzimbiti, she grasps a human heart--Saduko's,\nI presume, or perhaps Umbelazi's.\n\nNor was this all, for the figure was wrapped in a woman's hair, which I\nknew at once for that of Mameena, this hair being held in place by the\nnecklet of big blue beads she used to wear about her throat.\n\n                   *    *    *    *    *\n\nSome five years had gone by, during which many things had happened to me\nthat need not be recorded here, when one day I found myself in a rather\nremote part of the Umvoti district of Natal, some miles to the east of a\nmountain called the Eland's Kopje, whither I had gone to carry out a\nbig deal in mealies, over which, by the way, I lost a good bit of money.\nThat has always been my fate when I plunged into commercial ventures.\n\nOne night my wagons, which were overloaded with these confounded\nweevilly mealies, got stuck in the drift of a small tributary of the\nTugela that most inopportunely had come down in flood. Just as darkness\nfell I managed to get them up the bank in the midst of a pelting rain\nthat soaked me to the bone. There seemed to be no prospect of lighting\na fire or of obtaining any decent food, so I was about to go to bed\nsupperless when a flash of lightning showed me a large kraal situated\nupon a hillside about half a mile away, and an idea entered my mind.\n\n\"Who is the headman of that kraal?\" I asked of one of the Kafirs who had\ncollected round us in our trouble, as such idle fellows always do.\n\n\"Tshoza, Inkoosi,\" answered the man.\n\n\"Tshoza! Tshoza!\" I said, for the name seemed familiar to me. \"Who is\nTshoza?\"\n\n\"Ikona [I don't know], Inkoosi. He came from Zululand some years ago\nwith Saduko the Mad.\"\n\nThen, of course, I remembered at once, and my mind flew back to the\nnight when old Tshoza, the brother of Matiwane, Saduko's father, had cut\nout the cattle of the Bangu and we had fought the battle in the pass.\n\n\"Oh!\" I said, \"is it so? Then lead me to Tshoza, and I will give you\na 'Scotchman.'\" (That is, a two-shilling piece, so called because some\nenterprising emigrant from Scotland passed off a vast number of them\namong the simple natives of Natal as substitutes for half-crowns.)\n\nTempted by this liberal offer--and it was very liberal, because I was\nanxious to get to Tshoza's kraal before its inhabitants went to bed--the\nmeditative Kafir consented to guide me by a dark and devious path that\nran through bush and dripping fields of corn. At length we arrived--for\nif the kraal was only half a mile away, the path to it covered fully two\nmiles--and glad enough was I when we had waded the last stream and found\nourselves at its gate.\n\nIn response to the usual inquiries, conducted amid a chorus of yapping\ndogs, I was informed that Tshoza did not live there, but somewhere else;\nthat he was too old to see anyone; that he had gone to sleep and could\nnot be disturbed; that he was dead and had been buried last week, and so\nforth.\n\n\"Look here, my friend,\" I said at last to the fellow who was telling me\nall these lies, \"you go to Tshoza in his grave and say to him that if he\ndoes not come out alive instantly, Macumazahn will deal with his cattle\nas once he dealt with those of Bangu.\"\n\nImpressed with the strangeness of this message, the man departed, and\npresently, in the dim light of the rain-washed moon, I perceived a\nlittle old man running towards me; for Tshoza, who was pretty ancient\nat the beginning of this history, had not been made younger by a severe\nwound at the battle of the Tugela and many other troubles.\n\n\"Macumazahn,\" he said, \"is that really you? Why, I heard that you\nwere dead long ago; yes, and sacrificed an ox for the welfare of your\nSpirit.\"\n\n\"And ate it afterwards, I'll be bound,\" I answered.\n\n\"Oh! it must be you,\" he went on, \"who cannot be deceived, for it is\ntrue we ate that ox, combining the sacrifice to your Spirit with a\nfeast; for why should anything be wasted when one is poor? Yes, yes,\nit must be you, for who else would come creeping about a man's kraal at\nnight, except the Watcher-by-Night? Enter, Macumazahn, and be welcome.\"\n\nSo I entered and ate a good meal while we talked over old times.\n\n\"And now, where is Saduko?\" I asked suddenly as I lit my pipe.\n\n\"Saduko?\" he answered, his face changing as he spoke. \"Oh! of course he\nis here. You know I came away with him from Zululand. Why? Well, to\ntell the truth, because after the part we had played--against my will,\nMacumazahn--at the battle of Endondakusuka, I thought it safer to be\naway from a country where those who have worn their karosses inside out\nfind many enemies and few friends.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" I said. \"But about Saduko?\"\n\n\"Oh, I told you, did I not? He is in the next hut, and dying!\"\n\n\"Dying! What of, Tshoza?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" he answered mysteriously; \"but I think he must be\nbewitched. For a long while, a year or more, he has eaten little and\ncannot bear to be alone in the dark; indeed, ever since he left Zululand\nhe has been very strange and moody.\"\n\nNow I remembered what old Zikali had said to me years before to the\neffect that Saduko was living with a ghost which would kill him.\n\n\"Does he think much about Umbelazi, Tshoza?\" I asked.\n\n\"O Macumazana, he thinks of nothing else; the Spirit of Umbelazi is in\nhim day and night.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" I said. \"Can I see him?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Macumazahn. I will go and ask the lady Nandie at once,\nfor, if you can, I believe there is no time to lose.\" And he left the\nhut.\n\nTen minutes later he returned with a woman, Nandie the Sweet herself,\nthe same quiet, dignified Nandie whom I used to know, only now somewhat\nworn with trouble and looking older than her years.\n\n\"Greeting, Macumazahn,\" she said. \"I am pleased to see you, although it\nis strange, very strange, that you should come here just at this time.\nSaduko is leaving us--on a long journey, Macumazahn.\"\n\nI answered that I had heard so with grief, and wondered whether he would\nlike to see me.\n\n\"Yes, very much, Macumazahn; only be prepared to find him different from\nthe Saduko whom you knew. Be pleased to follow me.\"\n\nSo we went out of Tshoza's hut, across a courtyard to another large hut,\nwhich we entered. It was lit with a good lamp of European make; also a\nbright fire burned upon the hearth, so that the place was as light as\nday. At the side of the hut a man lay upon some blankets, watched by a\nwoman. His eyes were covered with his hand, and he was moaning:\n\n\"Drive him away! Drive him away! Cannot he suffer me to die in peace?\"\n\n\"Would you drive away your old friend, Macumazahn, Saduko?\" asked Nandie\nvery gently, \"Macumazahn, who has come from far to see you?\"\n\nHe sat up, and, the blankets falling off him, showed me that he was\nnothing but a living skeleton. Oh! how changed from that lithe and\nhandsome chief whom I used to know. Moreover, his lips quivered and his\neyes were full of terrors.\n\n\"Is it really you, Macumazahn?\" he said in a weak voice. \"Come, then,\nand stand quite close to me, so that he may not get between us,\" and he\nstretched out his bony hand.\n\nI took the hand; it was icy cold.\n\n\"Yes, yes, it is I, Saduko,\" I said in a cheerful voice; \"and there is\nno man to get between us; only the lady Nandie, your wife, and myself\nare in the hut; she who watched you has gone.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Macumazahn, there is another in the hut whom you cannot see.\nThere he stands,\" and he pointed towards the hearth. \"Look! The spear is\nthrough him and his plume lies on the ground!\"\n\n\"Through whom, Saduko?\"\n\n\"Whom? Why, the Prince Umbelazi, whom I betrayed for Mameena's sake.\"\n\n\"Why do you talk wind, Saduko?\" I asked. \"Years ago I saw\nIndhlovu-ene-Sihlonti die.\"\n\n\"Die, Macumazahn! We do not die; it is only our flesh that dies. Yes,\nyes, I have learned that since we parted. Do you not remember his last\nwords: 'I will haunt you while you live, and when you cease to live, ah!\nthen we shall meet again'? Oh! from that hour to this he _has_ haunted\nme, Macumazahn--he and the others; and now, now we are about to meet as\nhe promised.\"\n\nThen once more he hid his eyes and groaned.\n\n\"He is mad,\" I whispered to Nandie.\n\n\"Perhaps. Who knows?\" she answered, shaking her head.\n\nSaduko uncovered his eyes.\n\n\"Make 'the-thing-that-burns' brighter,\" he gasped, \"for I do not\nperceive him so clearly when it is bright. Oh! Macumazahn, he is looking\nat you and whispering. To whom is he whispering? I see! to Mameena,\nwho also looks at you and smiles. They are talking. Be silent. I must\nlisten.\"\n\nNow, I began to wish that I were out of that hut, for really a little\nof this uncanny business went a long way. Indeed, I suggested going, but\nNandie would not allow it.\n\n\"Stay with me till the end,\" she muttered. So I had to stay, wondering\nwhat Saduko heard Umbelazi whispering to Mameena, and on which side of\nme he saw her standing.\n\nHe began to wander in his mind.\n\n\"That was a clever pit you dug for Bangu, Macumazahn; but you would not\ntake your share of the cattle, so the blood of the Amakoba is not\non your head. Ah! what a fight was that which the Amawombe made at\nEndondakusuka. You were with them, you remember, Macumazahn; and why was\nI not at your side? Oh! then we would have swept away the Usutu as the\nwind sweeps ashes. Why was I not at your side to share the glory? I\nremember now--because of the Daughter of Storm. She betrayed me for\nUmbelazi, and I betrayed Umbelazi for her; and now he haunts me, whose\ngreatness I brought to the dust; and the Usutu wolf, Cetewayo, curls\nhimself up in his form and grows fat on his food. And--and, Macumazahn,\nit has all been done in vain, for Mameena hates me. Yes, I can read it\nin her eyes. She mocks and hates me worse in death than she did in\nlife, and she says that--that it was not all her fault--because she\nloves--because she loves--\"\n\nA look of bewilderment came upon his face--his poor, tormented\nface; then suddenly Saduko threw his arms wide, and sobbed in an\never-weakening voice:\n\n\"All--all done in vain! Oh! _Mameena, Ma--mee--na, Ma--meena!_\" and fell\nback dead.\n\n\n\"Saduko has gone away,\" said Nandie, as she drew a blanket over his\nface. \"But I wonder,\" she added with a little hysterical smile, \"oh!\nhow I wonder who it was the Spirit of Mameena told him that she\nloved--Mameena, who was born without a heart?\"\n\n\nI made no answer, for at that moment I heard a very curious sound, which\nseemed to me to proceed from somewhere above the hut. Of what did it\nremind me? Ah! I knew. It was like the sound of the dreadful laughter\nof Zikali, Opener-of-Roads--Zikali, the\n\n\"Thing-that-should-never-have-been-born.\"\n\nDoubtless, however, it was only the cry of some storm-driven night bird.\nOr perhaps it was an hyena that laughed--an hyena that scented death.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Child of Storm, by H.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
