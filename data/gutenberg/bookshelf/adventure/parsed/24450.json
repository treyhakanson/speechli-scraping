Nor all the facts associated with the disappearance of the\nRt. Hon. Joseph Blowter, Secretary of State for the Colonies.\n\nWe know (though this is not in the Blue Books) that Bosambo called\ntogether all his petty chiefs and his headmen, from one end of the\ncountry to the other, and assembled them squatting expectantly at the\nfoot of the little hillock, where sat Bosambo in his robes of office\n(unauthorized but no less magnificent), their upturned faces charged\nwith pride and confidence, eloquent of the hold this sometime Liberian\nconvict had upon the wayward and fearful folk of the Ochori.\n\nNow no man may call a palaver of all small chiefs unless he notifies the\ngovernment of his intention, for the government is jealous of\nself-appointed parliaments, for when men meet together in public\nconference, however innocent may be its first cause, talk invariably\ndrifts to war, just as when they assemble and talk in private it drifts\nwomanward.\n\nAnd since a million and odd square miles of territory may only be\ngoverned by a handful of ragged soldiers so long as there is no\nconcerted action against authority, extemporized and spontaneous\npalavers are severely discouraged.\n\nBut Bosambo was too cheery and optimistic a man to doubt that his action\nwould incur the censorship of his lord, and, moreover, he was so filled\nwith his own high plans and so warm and generous at heart at the thought\nof the benefits he might be conferring upon his patron that the\nillegality of the meeting did not occur to him, or if it occurred was\ndismissed as too preposterous for consideration.\n\nAnd so there had come by the forest paths, by canoe, from fishing\nvillages, from far-off agricultural lands near by the great mountains,\nfrom timber cuttings in the lower forest, higher chiefs and little\nchiefs, headmen and lesser headmen, till they made a respectable crowd,\ntoo vast for the comfort of the Ochori elders who must needs provide\nthem with food and lodgings.\n\n\"Noble chiefs of the Ochori,\" began Bosambo, and Notiki nudged his\nneighbour with a sharp elbow, for Notiki was an old man of forty-three,\nand thin.\n\n\"Our lord desires us to give him something,\" he said.\n\nHe was a bitter man this Notiki, a relative of former chiefs of the\nOchori, and now no more than over-head of four villages.\n\n\"Wa!\" said his neighbour, with his shining face turned to Bosambo.\n\nNotiki grunted but said no more.\n\n\"I have assembled you here,\" said Bosambo, \"because I love to see you,\nand because it is good that I should meet those who are in authority\nunder me to administer the laws which the King my master has set for\nyour guidance.\"\n\nWord for word it was a paraphrase of an address which Sanders himself\nhad delivered three months ago. His audience may have forgotten the\nfact, but Notiki at least recognized the plagiarism and said \"Oh, ho!\"\nunder his breath and made a scornful noise.\n\n\"Now I must go from you,\" said Bosambo.\n\nThere was a little chorus of dismay, but Notiki's voice did not swell\nthe volume.\n\n\"The King has called me to the coast, and for the space of two moons I\nshall be as dead to you, though my fetish will watch you and my spirit\nwill walk these streets every night with big ears to listen to evil\ntalk, and great big eyes to see the hearts of men. Yea, from this city\nto the very end of my dominions over to Kalala.\" His accusing eyes fixed\nNotiki, and the thin man wriggled uncomfortably.\n\n\"This man is a devil,\" he muttered under his breath, \"he hears and sees\nall things.\"\n\n\"And if you ask me why I go,\" Bosambo went on, \"I tell you this:\nswearing you all to secrecy that this word shall not go beyond your\nhuts\" (there were some two thousand people present to share the\nmystery), \"my lord Sandi has great need of me. For who of us is so wise\nthat he can look into the heart and understand the sorrow-call which\ngoes from brother to brother and from blood to blood. I say no more save\nmy lord desires me, and since I am the King of the Ochori, a nation\ngreat amongst all nations, must I go down to the coast like a dog or\nlike the headman of a fisher-village?\"\n\nHe paused dramatically, and there was a faint--a very faint--murmur\nwhich he might interpret as an expression of his people's wish that he\nshould travel in a state bordering upon magnificence.\n\nFaint indeed was that murmur, because there was a hint of taxation in\nthe business, a promise of levies to be extracted from an unwilling\npeasantry; a suggestion of lazy men leaving the comfortable shade of\ntheir huts to hurry perspiring in the forest that gum and rubber and\nsimilar offerings should be laid at the complacent feet of their\noverlord.\n\nBosambo heard the murmur and marked its horrid lack of heartiness and\nwas in no sense put out of countenance.\n\n\"As you say,\" said he approvingly, \"it is proper that I should journey\nto my lord and to the strange people beyond the coast--to the land where\neven slaves wear trousers--carrying with me most wonderful presents that\nthe name of the Ochori shall be as thunder upon the waters and even\ngreat kings shall speak in pride of you,\" he paused again.\n\nNow it was a dead silence which greeted his peroration. Notably\nunenthusiastic was this gathering, twiddling its toes and blandly\navoiding his eye. Two moons before he had extracted something more than\nhis tribute--a tribute which was the prerogative of government.\n\nYet then, as Notiki said under his breath, or openly, or by innuendo as\nthe sentiment of his company demanded, four and twenty canoes laden with\nthe fruits of taxation had come to the Ochori city, and five only of\nthose partly filled had paddled down to headquarters to carry the Ochori\ntribute to the overlord of the land.\n\n\"I will bring back with me new things,\" said Bosambo enticingly;\n\"strange devil boxes, large magics which will entrance you, things that\nno common man has seen, such as I and Sandi alone know in all this land.\nGo now, I tell thee, to your people in this country, telling them all\nthat I have spoken to you, and when the moon is in a certain quarter\nthey will come in joy bearing presents in both hands, and these ye shall\nbring to me.\"\n\n\"But, lord!\" it was the bold Notiki who stood in protest, \"what shall\nhappen to such of us headmen who come without gifts in our hands for\nyour lordship, saying 'Our people are stubborn and will give nothing'?\"\n\n\"Who knows?\" was all the satisfaction he got from Bosambo, with the\nadditional significant hint, \"I shall not blame you, knowing that it is\nnot because of your fault but because your people do not love you, and\nbecause they desire another chief over them. The palaver is finished.\"\n\nFinished it was, so far as Bosambo was concerned. He called a council of\nhis headmen that night in his hut.\n\nBosambo made his preparations at leisure. There was much to avoid before\nhe took his temporary farewell of the tribe. Not the least to be counted\namongst those things to be done was the extraction, to its uttermost\npossibility, of the levy which he had quite improperly instituted.\n\nAnd of the things to avoid, none was more urgent or called for greater\nthought than the necessity for so timing his movements that he did not\ncome upon Sanders or drift within the range of his visible and audible\ninfluence.\n\nHere fortune may have been with Bosambo, but it is more likely that he\nhad carefully thought out every detail of his scheme. Sanders at the\nmoment was collecting hut tax along the Kisai river and there was also,\nas Bosambo well knew, a murder trial of great complexity waiting for his\ndecision at Ikan. A headman was suspected of murdering his chief wife,\nand the only evidence against him was that of the under wives to whom\nshe displayed much hauteur and arrogance.\n\nThe people of the Ochori might be shocked at the exorbitant demands\nwhich their lord put upon them, but they were too wise to deny him his\nwishes. There had been a time in the history of the Ochori when demands\nwere far heavier, and made with great insolence by a people who bore the\nreputation of being immensely fearful. It had come to be a by-word of\nthe people when they discussed their lord with greater freedom than he\ncould have wished, the tyranny of Bosambo was better than the tyranny of\nAkasava.\n\nAmongst the Ochori chiefs, greater and lesser, only one was conspicuous\nby his failure to carry proper offerings to his lord. When all the gifts\nwere laid on sheets of native cloth in the great space before Bosambo's\nhut, Notiki's sheet was missing and with good reason as he sent his son\nto explain.\n\n\"Lord,\" said this youth, lank and wild, \"my father has collected for you\nmany beautiful things, such as gum and rubber and the teeth of\nelephants. Now he would have brought these and laid them at your lovely\nfeet, but the roads through the forest are very evil, and there have\nbeen floods in the northern country and he cannot pass the streams. Also\nthe paths through the forest are thick and tangled and my father fears\nfor his carriers.\"\n\nBosambo looked at him, thoughtfully.\n\n\"Go back to your father, N'gobi,\" he said gently, \"and tell him that\nthough there come no presents from him to me, I, his master and chief,\nknowing he loves me, understand all things well.\"\n\nN'gobi brightened visibly. He had been ready to bolt, understanding\nsomething of Bosambo's dexterity with a stick and fearing that the chief\nwould loose upon him the vengeance his father had called down upon his\nown hoary head.\n\n\"Of the evil roads I know,\" said Bosambo; \"now this you shall say to\nyour father: Bosambo the chief goes away from this city and upon a long\njourney; for two moons he will be away doing the business of his cousin\nand friend Sandi. And when my lord Bim-bi has bitten once at the third\nmoon I will come back and I will visit your father. But because the\nroads are bad,\" he went on, \"and the floods come even in this dry\nseason,\" he said significantly, \"and the forest is so entangled that he\ncannot bring his presents, sending only the son of his wife to me, he\nshall make against my coming such a road as shall be in width, the\ndistance between the King's hut and the hut of the King's wife; and he\nshall clear from this road all there are of trees, and he shall bridge\nthe strong stream and dig pits for the floods. And to this end he shall\ntake every man of his kingdom and set them to labour, and as they work\nthey shall sing a song which goes:\n\n     \"We are doing Notiki's work,\n     The work Notiki set us to do,\n     Rather than send to the lord his King\n     The presents which Bosambo demanded.\n\n\"The palaver is finished.\"\n\nThis is the history, or the beginning of the history, of the straight\nroad which cuts through the heart of the Ochori country from the edge of\nthe river by the cataracts, even to the mountains of the great King, a\nroad famous throughout Africa and imperishably associated with Bosambo's\nname--this by the way.\n\nOn the first day following the tax palaver Bosambo went down the river\nwith four canoes, each canoe painted beautifully with camwood and gum,\nand with twenty-four paddlers.\n\nIt was by a fluke that he missed Sanders. As it happened, the\nCommissioner had come back to the big river to collect the evidence of\nthe murdered woman's brother who was a petty headman of an Isisi fishing\nvillage. The _Zaire_ came into the river almost as the last of Bosambo's\ncanoes went round the bend out of sight, and since a legend existed on\nthe river, a legend for the inception of which Bosambo himself was\nmainly responsible, that he was in some way related to Mr. Commissioner\nSanders, no man spoke of Bosambo's passing.\n\nThe chief came to headquarters on the third day after his departure from\nhis city. His subsequent movements are somewhat obscure, even to\nSanders, who has been at some pains to trace them.\n\nIt is known that he drew a hundred and fifty pounds in English gold from\nSanders' storekeeper--he had piled up a fairly extensive credit during\nthe years of his office--that he embarked with one headman and his wife\non a coasting boat due for Sierra Leone, and that from that city came a\nlong-winded demand in Arabic by a ragged messenger for a further\ninstalment of one hundred pounds. Sanders heard the news on his return\nto headquarters and was a little worried.\n\n\"I wonder if the devil is going to desert his people?\" he said.\n\nHamilton the Houssa laughed.\n\n\"He is more likely to desert his people than to desert a balance of four\nhundred pounds which now stands to his credit here,\" he said. \"Bosambo\nhas felt the call of civilization. I suppose he ought to have secured\nyour permission to leave his territory?\"\n\n\"He has given his people work to keep them busy,\" Sanders said a little\ngravely. \"I have had a passionate protest from Notiki, one of his chiefs\nin the north. Bosambo has set him to build a road through the forest,\nand Notiki objects.\"\n\nThe two men were walking across the yellow parade ground past the\nHoussas hut in the direction of headquarters' bungalow.\n\n\"What about your murderer?\" asked Hamilton, after a while, as they\nmounted the broad wooden steps which led to the bungalow stoep.\n\nSanders shook his head.\n\n\"Everybody lied,\" he said briefly. \"I can do no less than send the man\nto the Village. I could have hung him on clear evidence, but the lady\nseemed to have been rather unpopular and the murderer quite a person to\nbe commended in the eyes of the public. The devil of it is,\" he said as\nhe sank into his big chair with a sigh, \"that had I hanged him it would\nnot have been necessary to write three foolscap sheets of report. I\ndislike these domestic murderers intensely--give me a ravaging brigand\nwith the hands of all people against him.\"\n\n\"You'll have one if you don't touch wood,\" said Hamilton seriously.\n\nHamilton came of Scottish stock--and the Scots are notorious prophets.\n\n\nII\n\nNow the truth may be told of Bosambo, and all his movements may be\nexplained by this revelation of his benevolence. In the silence of his\nhut had he planned his schemes. In the dark aisles of the forests, under\nstarless skies when his fellow-huntsmen lay deep in the sleep which the\ninnocent and the barbarian alone enjoy; in drowsy moments when he sat\ndispensing justice, what time litigants had droned monotonously he had\nperfected his scheme.\n\nImagination is the first fruit of civilization and when the reverend\nfathers of the coast taught Bosambo certain magics, they were also\nimplanting in him the ability to picture possibilities, and shape from\nhis knowledge of human affairs the eventual consequences of his actions.\nThis is imagination somewhat elaborately and clumsily defined.\n\nTo one person only had Bosambo unburdened himself of his schemes.\n\nIn the privacy of his great hut he had sat with his wife, a steaming\ndish of fish between them, for however lax Bosambo might be, his wife\nwas an earnest follower of the Prophet and would tolerate no such\nabomination as the flesh of the cloven-hoofed goat.\n\nHe had told her many things.\n\n\"Light of my heart,\" said he, \"our lord Sandi is my father and my\nmother, a giver of riches, and a plentiful provider of pence. Now it\nseems to me, that though he is a just man and great, having neither fear\nof his enemies nor soft words for his friends, yet the lords of his land\nwho live so very far away do him no honour.\"\n\n\"Master,\" said the woman quietly, \"is it no honour that he should be\nplaced as a king over us?\"\n\nBosambo beamed approvingly.\n\n\"Thou hast spoken the truth, oh my beloved!\" said he, in the\nextravagance of his admiration. \"Yet I know much of the white folk, for\nI have lived along this coast from Dacca to Mossomedes. Also I have\nsailed to a far place called Madagascar, which is on the other side of\nthe world, and I know the way of white folk. Even in Benguella there is\na governor who is not so great as Sandi, and about his breast are all\nmanner of shining stars that glitter most beautifully in the sun, and he\nwears ribbons about him and bright coloured sashes and swords.\" He\nwagged his finger impressively. \"Have I not said that he is not so great\nas Sandi. When saw you my lord with stars or cross or sash or a sword?\n\n\"Also at Decca, where the Frenchi live. At certain places in the Togo,\nwhich is Allamandi,[1] I have seen men with this same style of\nornaments, for thus it is that the white folk do honour to their kind.\"\n\n[Footnote 1: Allamandi--German territory.]\n\nHe was silent a long time and his brown-eyed wife looked at him\ncuriously.\n\n\"Yet what can you do, my lord?\" she asked. \"Although you are very\npowerful, and Sandi loves you, this is certain, that none will listen to\n_you_ and do honour to Sandi at your word--though I do not know the ways\nof the white people, yet of this I am sure.\"\n\nAgain Bosambo's large mouth stretched from ear to ear, and his two rows\nof white teeth gleamed pleasantly.\n\n\"You are as the voice of wisdom and the very soul of cleverness,\" he\nsaid, \"for you speak that which is true. Yet I know ways, for I am very\ncunning and wise, being a holy man and acquainted with blessed apostles\nsuch as Paul and the blessed Peter, who had his ear cut off because a\ncertain dancing woman desired it. Also by magic it was put on again\nbecause he could not hear the cocks crow. All this and similar things I\nhave here.\" He touched his forehead.\n\nWise woman that she was, she had made no attempt to pry into her\nhusband's business, but spent the days preparing for the journey, she\nand the nut-brown sprawling child of immense girth, who was the apple\nof Bosambo's eye.\n\nSo Bosambo had passed down the river as has been described, and four\ndays after he left there disappeared from the Ochori village ten\nbrothers in blood of his, young hunting men who had faced all forms of\ndeath for the very love of it, and these vanished from the land and none\nknew where they went save that they did not follow on their master's\ntrail.\n\nTukili, the chief of the powerful eastern island Isisi, or, as it is\ncontemptuously called, the N'gombi-Isisi by the riverain folk, went\nhunting one day, and ill fortune led him to the border of the Ochori\ncountry. Ill fortune was it for one Fimili, a straight maid of fourteen,\nbeautiful by native standard, who was in the forest searching for roots\nwhich were notorious as a cure for \"boils\" which distressed her\nunamiable father.\n\nTukili saw the girl and desired her, and that which Tukili desired he\ntook. She offered little opposition to being carried away to the Isisi\ncity when she discovered that her life would be spared, and possibly was\nno worse off in the harem of Tukili than she would have been in the hut\nof the poor fisherman for whom her father had designed her. A few years\nbefore, such an incident would have passed almost unnoticed.\n\nThe Ochori were so used to being robbed of women and of goats, so meek\nin their acceptance of wrongs that would have set the spears of any\nother nation shining, that they would have accepted the degradation and\npreserved a sense of thankfulness that the robber had limited his\nraiding to one girl, and that a maid. But with the coming of Bosambo\nthere had arrived a new spirit in the Ochori. They had learnt their\nstrength, incidentally they had learnt their rights. The father of the\ngirl went hot-foot to his over-chief, Notiki, and covered himself with\nashes at the door of the chief's hut.\n\n\"This is a bad palaver,\" said Notiki, \"and since Bosambo has deserted us\nand is making our marrows like water that we should build him a road,\nand there is none in this land whom I may call chief or who may speak\nwith authority, it seems by my age and by relationship to the kings of\nthis land, I must do that which is desirable.\"\n\nSo he gathered together two thousand men who were working on the road\nand were very pleased indeed to carry something lighter than rocks and\nfelled trees, and with these spears he marched into the Isisi forest,\nburning and slaying whenever he came upon a little village which offered\nno opposition. Thus he took to himself the air and title of conqueror\nwith as little excuse as a flamboyant general ever had.\n\nHad it occurred on the river, this warlike expedition must have\nattracted the attention of Sanders. The natural roadway of the territory\nis a waterway. It is only when operations are begun against the internal\ntribes who inhabit the bush, and whose armies can move under the cloak\nof the forest (and none wiser) that Sanders found himself at a\ndisadvantage.\n\nTukili himself heard nothing of the army that was being led against him\nuntil it was within a day's march of his gates. Then he sallied forth\nwith a force skilled in warfare and practised in the hunt. The combat\nlasted exactly ten minutes and all that was left of Notiki's spears made\nthe best of their way homeward, avoiding, as far as possible, those\nvillages which they had visited en route with such disastrous results to\nthe unfortunate inhabitants.\n\nNow it is impossible that one conqueror shall be sunk to oblivion\nwithout his victor claiming for himself the style of his victim. Tukili\nhad defeated his adversary, and Tukili was no exception to the general\nrule, and from being a fairly well-disposed king, amiable--too amiable\nas we have shown--and kindly, and just, he became of a sudden a menace\nto all that part of Sanders' territory which lies between the French\nland and the river.\n\nIt was such a situation as this as only Bosambo might deal with, and\nSanders heartily cursed his absent chief and might have cursed him with\ngreater fervour had he had an inkling of the mission to which Bosambo\nhad appointed himself.\n\n\nIII\n\nHis Excellency the Administrator of the period had his office at a\nprosperous city of stone which we will call Koombooli, though that is\nnot its name.\n\nHe was a stout, florid man, patient and knowledgeable. He had been sent\nto clear up the mess which two incompetent administrators made, who had\nowed their position rather to the constant appearance of their friends\nand patrons in the division lobbies than to their acquaintance with the\nnative mind, and it is eloquent of the regard in which His Excellency\nwas held that, although he was a Knight Commander of St. Michael and St.\nGeorge, a Companion of a Victorian Order, a Commander of the Bath, and\nthe son of a noble house, he was known familiarly along the coast to all\nadministrators, commissioners, even to the deputy inspectors, as \"Bob.\"\n\nBosambo came to the presence with an inward quaking. In a sense he had\nabsconded from his trust, and he did not doubt that Sanders had made all\nmen acquainted with the suddenness and the suspicious character of his\ndisappearance.\n\nAnd the first words of His Excellency the Administrator confirmed all\nBosambo's worst fears.\n\n\"O! chief,\" said Sir Robert with a little twinkle in his eye, \"are you\nso fearful of your people that you run away from them?\"\n\n\"Mighty master,\" answered Bosambo, humbly, \"I do not know fear, for as\nyour honour may have heard, I am a very brave man, fearing nothing save\nmy lord Sanders' displeasure.\"\n\nA ghost of a smile played about the corners of Sir Robert's mouth.\n\n\"That you have earned, my friend,\" said he. \"Now you shall tell me why\nyou came away secretly, also why you desired this palaver with me. And\ndo not lie, Bosambo,\" he said, \"for I am he who hung three chiefs on\nGallows Hill above Grand Bassam because they spoke falsely.\"\n\nThis was one of the fictions which was current on the coast, and was\nimplicitly believed in by the native population. The truth will be\nrecounted at another time, but it is sufficient to say that Bosambo was\none of those who did not doubt the authenticity of the legend.\n\n\"Now I will speak to you, O my lord,\" he said earnestly, \"and I speak by\nall oaths, both the oaths of my own people----\"\n\n\"Spare me the oaths of the Kroo folk,\" protested Sir Robert, and raised\na warning hand.\n\n\"Then by Markie and Lukie will I swear,\" said Bosambo, fervently; \"those\nfine fellows of whom Your Excellency knows. I have sat long in the\ncountry of the Ochori, and I have ruled wisely according to my\nabilities. And over me at all times was Sandi, who was a father to his\npeople and so beautiful of mind and countenance that when he came to us\neven the dead folk would rise up to speak to him. This is a miracle,\"\nsaid Bosambo profoundly but cautiously, \"which I have heard but which I\nhave not seen. Now this I ask you who see all things, and here is the\npuzzle which I will set to your honour. If Sandi is so great and so\nwise, and is so loved by the greater King, how comes it that he stays\nfor ever in one place, having no beautiful stars about his neck nor\nwonderful ribbons around his stomach such as the great Frenchiman--and\nthe great Allamandi men, and even the Portuguesi men wear who are\nhonoured by their kings?\"\n\nIt was a staggering question, and Sir Robert Sanleigh sat up and stared\nat the solemn face of the man before him.\n\nBosambo, an unromantic figure in trousers, jacket, and shirt--he was\ncollarless--had thrust his hands deeply into unaccustomed pockets,\nignorant of the disrespect which such an attitude displayed, and was\nstaring back at the Administrator.\n\n\"O! chief,\" asked the puzzled Sir Robert, \"this is a strange palaver you\nmake--who gave you these ideas?\"\n\n\"Lord, none gave me this idea save my own bright mind,\" said Bosambo.\n\"Yes, many nights have I laid thinking of these things for I am just and\nI have faith.\"\n\nHis Excellency kept his unwavering eye upon the other. He had heard of\nBosambo, knew him as an original, and at this moment was satisfied in\nhis own mind of the other's sincerity.\n\nA smaller man than he, his predecessor for example, might have dismissed\nthe preposterous question as an impertinence and given the questioner\nshort shrift. But Sir Robert understood his native.\n\n\"These are things too high for me, Bosambo,\" he said. \"What dog am I\nthat I should question the mind of my lords? In their wisdom they give\nhonour and they punish. It is written.\"\n\nBosambo nodded.\n\n\"Yet, lord,\" he persisted, \"my own cousin who sweeps your lordship's\nstables told me this morning that on the days of big palavers you also\nhave stars and beautiful things upon your breast, and noble ribbons\nabout your lordship's stomach. Now your honour shall tell me by whose\nfavour these things come about.\"\n\nSir Robert chuckled.\n\n\"Bosambo,\" he said solemnly, \"they gave these things to me because I am\nan old man. Now when your lord Sandi becomes old these honours also will\nhe receive.\"\n\nHe saw Bosambo's face fall and went on:\n\n\"Also much may happen that will bring Sandi to their lordships' eyes,\nthey who sit above us. Some great deed that he may do, some high service\nhe may offer to his king. All these happenings bring nobility and\nhonour. Now,\" he went on kindly, \"go back to your people, remembering\nthat I shall think of you and of Sandi, and that I shall know that you\ncame because of your love for him, and that on a day which is written I\nwill send a book to my masters speaking well of Sandi, for his sake and\nfor the sake of the people who love him. The palaver is finished.\"\n\nBosambo went out of the Presence a dissatisfied man, passed through the\nhall where a dozen commissioners and petty chiefs were waiting audience,\nskirted the great white building and came in time to his own cousin,\nwho swept the stables of His Excellency the Administrator. And here, in\nthe coolness of the stone-walled mews, he learnt much about the\nAdministrator; little tit-bits of information which were unlikely to be\npublished in the official gazette. Also he acquired a considerable\namount of data concerning the giving of honours, and after a long\nexamination and cross-examination of his wearied relative he left him as\ndry as a sucked orange, but happy in the possession of a new\nfive-shilling piece which Bosambo had magnificently pressed upon him,\nand which subsequently proved to be bad.\n\n\nIV\n\nBy the River of Spirits is a deep forest which stretches back and back\nin a dense and chaotic tangle of strangled sapling and parasitic weed to\nthe edge of the Pigmy forest. No man--white or brown or black--has\nexplored the depth of the Forbidden Forest, for here the wild beasts\nhave their lairs and rear their young; and here are mosquito in dense\nclouds. Moreover, and this is important, a certain potent ghost named\nBim-bi stalks restlessly from one border of the forest to the other.\nBim-bi is older than the sun and more terrible than any other ghost. For\nhe feeds on the moon, and at nights you may see how the edge of the\ndesert world is bitten by his great mouth until it becomes, first, the\nhalf of a moon, then the merest slither, and then no moon at all. And on\nthe very dark nights, when the gods are hastily making him a new meal,\nthe ravenous Bim-bi calls to his need the stars; and you may watch, as\nevery little boy of the Akasava has watched, clutching his father's hand\ntightly in his fear, the hot rush of meteors across the velvet sky to\nthe rapacious and open jaws of Bim-bi.\n\nHe was a ghost respected by all peoples--Akasava, Ochori, Isisi,\nN'gombi, and Bush folk. By the Bolengi, the Bomongo, and even the\ndistant Upper Congo people feared him. Also all the chiefs for\ngenerations upon generations had sent tribute of corn and salt to the\nedge of the forest for his propitiation, and it is a legend that when\nthe Isisi fought the Akasava in the great war, the envoy of the Isisi\nwas admitted without molestation to the enemy's lines in order to lay an\noffering at Bim-bi's feet. Only one man in the world, so far as the\nPeople of the River know, has ever spoken slightingly of Bim-bi, and\nthat man was Bosambo of the Ochori, who had no respect for any ghosts\nsave of his own creation.\n\nIt is the custom on the Akasava district to hold a ghost palaver to\nwhich the learned men of all tribes are invited, and the palaver takes\nplace in the village of Ookos by the edge of the forest.\n\nOn a certain day in the year of the floods and when Bosambo was gone a\nmonth from his land, there came messengers chance-found and walking in\nterror to all the principal cities and villages of the Akasava, of the\nIsisi, and of the N'gombi-Isisi carrying this message:\n\n     \"Mimbimi, son of Simbo Sako, son of Ogi, has opened his house to\n     his friends on the night when Bim-bi has swallowed the moon.\"\n\nA summons to such a palaver in the second name of Bim-bi was not one\nlikely to be ignored, but a summons from Mimbimi was at least to be\nwondered at and to be speculated upon, for Mimbimi was an unknown\nquantity, though some gossips professed to know him as the chief of one\nof the Nomadic tribes which ranged the heart of the forest, preying on\nAkasava and Isisi with equal discrimination. But these gossips were of a\nmind not peculiar to any nationality or to any colour. They were those\njealous souls who either could not or would not confess that they were\nignorant on the topic of the moment.\n\nBe he robber chief, or established by law and government, this much was\ncertain. Mimbimi had called for his secret palaver and the most noble\nand arrogant of chiefs must obey, even though the obedience spelt\ndisaster for the daring man who had summoned them to conference.\n\nTuligini, a victorious captain, not lightly to be summoned, might have\nignored the invitation, but for the seriousness of his eldermen, who,\nversed in the conventions of Bim-bi and those who invoked his name,\nstood aghast at the mere suggestion that this palaver should be\nignored. Tuligini demanded, and with reason:\n\n\"Who was this who dare call the vanquisher of Bosambo to a palaver? for\nam I not the great buffalo of the forest? and do not all men bow down to\nme in fear?\"\n\n\"Lord, you speak the truth,\" said his trembling councillor, \"yet this is\na ghost palaver and all manner of evils come to those who do not obey.\"\n\nSanders, through his spies, heard of the summons in the name of Bim-bi,\nand was a little troubled. There was nothing too small to be serious in\nthe land over which he ruled.\n\nAs for instance: Some doubt existed in the Lesser N'gombi country as to\nwhether teeth filed to a point were more becoming than teeth left as\nNature placed them. Tombini, the chief of N'gombi, held the view that\nNature's way was best, whilst B'limbini, his cousin, was the chief\nexponent of the sharpened form.\n\nIt took two battalions of King Coast Rifles, half a battery of artillery\nand Sanders to settle the question, which became a national one.\n\n\"I wish Bosambo were to the devil before he left his country,\" said\nSanders, irritably. \"I should feel safe if that oily villain was sitting\nin the Ochori.\"\n\n\"What is the trouble?\" asked Hamilton, looking up from his task--he was\nmaking cigarettes with a new machine which somebody had sent him from\nhome.\n\n\"An infernal Bim-bi palaver,\" said Sanders; \"the last time that\nhappened, if I remember rightly, I had to burn crops on the right bank\nof the river for twenty miles to bring the Isisi to a sense of their\nunimportance.\"\n\n\"You will be able to burn crops on the left side this time,\" said\nHamilton, cheerfully, his nimble fingers twiddling the silver rollers of\nhis machine.\n\n\"I thought I had the country quiet,\" said Sanders, a little bitterly,\n\"and at this moment I especially wanted it so.\"\n\n\"Why at this particular moment?\" asked the other in surprise.\n\nSanders took out of the breast pocket of his uniform jacket a folded\npaper, and passed it across the table.\n\nHamilton read:\n\n     \"SIR,--I have the honour to inform you that the Rt. Hon. Mr. James\n     Bolzer, his Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, is\n     expected to arrive at your station on the thirtieth inst. I trust\n     you will give the Right Honourable gentleman every facility for\n     studying on the spot the problems upon which he is such an\n     authority. I have to request you to instruct all Sub-Commissioners,\n     Inspectors, and Officers commanding troops in your division to make\n     adequate arrangements for Mr. Bolzer's comfort and protection.\n\n                         \"I have the honour to be, etc.\"\n\nHamilton read the letter twice.\n\n\"To study on the spot those questions upon which he is such an\nauthority,\" he repeated. He was a sarcastic devil when he liked.\n\n\"The thirtieth is to-morrow,\" Hamilton went on, \"and I suppose I am one\nof the officers commanding troops who must school my ribald soldiery in\nthe art of protecting the Rt. Hon. gent.\"\n\n\"To be exact,\" said Sanders, \"you are the only officer commanding troops\nin the territory; do what you can. You wouldn't believe it,\" he smiled a\nlittle shamefacedly, \"I had applied for six months' leave when this\ncame.\"\n\n\"Good Lord!\" said Hamilton, for somehow he never associated Sanders with\nholidays.\n\nWhat Hamilton did was very simple, because Hamilton always did things in\nthe manner which gave him the least trouble. A word to his orderly\nconveyed across the parade ground, roused the sleepy bugler of the\nguard, and the air was filled with the \"Assembly.\" Sixty men of the\nHoussas paraded in anticipation of a sudden call northwards.\n\n\"My children,\" said Hamilton, whiffling his pliant cane, \"soon there\nwill come here a member of government who knows nothing. Also he may\nstray into the forest and lose himself as the bride-groom's cow strays\nfrom the field of his father-in-law, not knowing his new surroundings.\nNow it is to you we look for his safety--I and the government. Also\nSandi, our lord. You shall not let this stranger out of your sight, nor\nshall you allow approach him any such evil men as the N'gombi iron\nsellers or the fishing men of N'gar or makers of wooden charms, for the\ngovernment has said this man must not be robbed, but must be treated\nwell, and you of the guard shall all salute him, also, when the time\narrives.\"\n\nHamilton meant no disrespect in his graphic illustration. He was dealing\nwith a simple people who required vivid word-pictures to convince them.\nAnd certainly they found nothing undignified in the right honourable\ngentleman when he arrived next morning.\n\nHe was above the medium height, somewhat stout, very neat and orderly,\nand he twirled a waxed moustache, turning grey. He had heavy and bilious\neyes, and a certain pompousness of manner distinguished him. Also an\neffervescent geniality which found expression in shaking hands with\nanybody who happened to be handy, in mechanically agreeing with all\nviews that were put before him and immediately afterwards contradicting\nthem; in a painful desire to be regarded as popular. In fact, in all the\nthings which got immediately upon Sanders' nerves, this man was a sealed\npattern of a bore.\n\nHe wanted to know things, but the things he wanted to know were of no\nimportance, and the information he extracted could not be of any\nassistance to him. His mind was largely occupied in such vital problems\nas what happened to the brooms which the Houssas used to keep their\nquarters clean when they were worn out, and what would be the effect of\nan increased ration of lime juice upon the morals and discipline of the\ntroops under Hamilton's command. Had he been less of a trial Sanders\nwould not have allowed him to go into the interior without a stronger\nprotest. As it was, Sanders had turned out of his own bedroom, and had\nput all his slender resources at the disposal of the Cabinet Minister\n(taking his holiday, by the way, during the long recess), and had\nwearied himself in order to reach some subject of interest where he and\nhis guest could meet on common ground.\n\n\"I shall have to let him go,\" he said to Hamilton, when the two had met\none night after Mr. Blowter had retired to bed, \"I spent the whole of\nthis afternoon discussing the comparative values of mosquito nets, and\nhe is such a perfect ass that you cannot snub him. If he had only had\nthe sense to bring a secretary or two he would have been easier to\nhandle.\"\n\nHamilton laughed.\n\n\"When a man like that travels,\" he said, \"he ought to bring somebody who\nknows the ways and habits of the animal. I had a bright morning with him\ngoing into the question of boots.\"\n\n\"But what of Mimbimi?\"\n\n\"Mimbimi is rather a worry to me. I do not know him at all,\" said\nSanders with a puzzled frown. \"Ahmet, the spy, has seen one of the\nchiefs who attended the palaver, which apparently was very impressive.\nUp to now nothing has happened which would justify a movement against\nhim; the man is possibly from the French Congo.\"\n\n\"Any news of Bosambo?\" asked Hamilton.\n\nSanders shook his head.\n\n\"So far as I can learn,\" he said grimly, \"he has gone on _Cape Coast\nCastle_ for a real aboriginal jag. There will be trouble for Bosambo\nwhen he comes back.\"\n\n\"What a blessing it would be now,\" sighed Hamilton, \"if we could turn\nold man Blowter into his tender keeping.\" And the men laughed\nsimultaneously.\n\n\nV\n\nThere was a time, years and years ago, when the Ochori people set a\ngreat stake on the edge of the forest by the Mountain. This they smeared\nwith a paint made by the admixture of camwood and copal gum.\n\nIt was one of the few intelligent acts which may be credited to the\nOchori in those dull days, for the stake stood for danger. It marked the\nboundary of the N'gombi lands beyond which it was undesirable that any\nman of the Ochori should go.\n\nIt was not erected without consideration. A palaver which lasted from\nthe full of one moon to the waning of the next, sacrifices of goats and\nsprinkling of blood, divinations, incantations, readings of devil marks\non sandy foreshores; all right and proper ceremonies were gone through\nbefore there came a night of bright moonlight when the whole Ochori\nnation went forth and planted that post.\n\nThen, I believe, the people of the Ochori, having invested the post\nwith qualities which it did not possess, went back to their homes and\nforgot all about it. Yet if they forgot there were nations who regarded\nthe devil sign with some awe, and certainly Mimbimi, the newly-arisen\nranger of the forest, who harried the Akasava and the Isisi, and even\nthe N'gombi-Isisi, must have had full faith in its potency, for he never\nmoved beyond that border. Once, so legend said, he brought his terrible\nwarriors to the very edge of the land and paid homage to the innocent\nsign-post which Sanders had set up and which announced no more, in plain\nEnglish, than trespassers will be prosecuted. Having done his _devoir_\nhe retired to his forest lair. His operations were not to go without an\nattempted reprisal. Many parties went out against him, notably that\nwhich Tumbilimi the chief of Isisi led. He took a hundred picked men to\navenge the outrage which this intruder had put upon him in daring to\nsummons him to palaver.\n\nNow Sugini was an arrogant man, for had he not routed the army of\nBosambo? That Bosambo was not in command made no difference and did not\ntarnish the prestige in Tumbilimi's eyes, and though the raids upon his\nterritory by Mimbimi had been mild, the truculent chief, disdaining the\nuse of his full army, marched with his select column to bring in the\nhead and the feet of the man who had dared violate his territory.\n\nExactly what happened to Tumbilimi's party is not known; all the men who\nescaped from the ambush in which Mimbimi lay give a different account,\nand each account creditable to themselves, though the only thing which\nstands in their favour is that they did certainly save their lives.\nCertainly Tumbilimi, he of the conquering spears, came back no more, and\nthose parts which he had threatened to detach from his enemy were in\nfact detached from him and were discovered one morning at the very gates\nof his city for his horrified subjects to marvel at. When warlike\ndiscussions arose, as they did at infrequent intervals, it was the\npractice of the people to send complaints to Sanders and leave him to\ndeal with the matter. You cannot, however, lead an army against a dozen\nguerrilla chiefs with any profit to the army as we once discovered in a\ncountry somewhat south of Sanders' domains. Had Mimbimi's sphere of\noperations been confined to the river Sanders would have laid him by the\nheels quickly enough, because the river brigand is easy to catch since\nhe would starve in the forest, and if he took to the bush would\ncertainly come back to the gleaming water for very life.\n\nBut here was a forest man obviously, who needed no river for himself,\nbut was content to wait watchfully in the dim recesses of the woods.\n\nSanders sent three spies to locate him, and gave his attention to the\nmore immediate problem of his Right Honourable guest. Mr. Joseph Blowter\nhad decided to make a trip into the interior and the _Zaire_ had been\nplaced at his disposal. A heaven-sent riot in the bushland, sixty miles\nwest of the Residency, had relieved both Sanders and Hamilton from the\nnecessity of accompanying the visitor, and he departed by steamer with a\nbodyguard of twenty armed Houssas; more than sufficient in these\npeaceful times.\n\n\"What about Mimbimi?\" asked Hamilton under his breath as they stood on a\nlittle concrete quay, and watched the _Zaire_ beating out to midstream.\n\n\"Mimbimi is evidently a bushman,\" said Sanders briefly. \"He will not\ncome to the river. Besides, he is giving the Ochori a wide berth, and it\nis to the Ochori that our friend is going. I cannot see how he can\npossibly dump himself into mischief.\"\n\nNevertheless, as a matter of precaution, Sanders telegraphed to the\nAdministration not only the departure, but the precautions he had taken\nfor the safety of the Minister, and the fact that neither he nor\nHamilton were accompanying him on his tour of inspection \"to study on\nthe spot those problems with which he was so well acquainted.\"\n\n\"O.K.\" flashed Bob across the wires, and that was sufficient for\nSanders. Of Mr. Blowter's adventures it is unnecessary to tell in\ndetail. How he mistook every village for a city, and every city for a\nnation, of how he landed wherever he could and spoke long and eloquently\non the blessing of civilization, and the glories of the British\nflag--all this through an interpreter--of how he went into the question\nof basket-making and fly-fishing, and of how he demonstrated to the\nfishermen of the little river a method of catching fish by fly, and how\nhe did not catch anything. All these matters might be told in great\ndetail with no particular credit to the subject of the monograph.\n\nIn course of time he came to the Ochori land and was welcomed by Notiki,\nwho had taken upon himself, on the strength of his rout, the position of\nchieftainship. This he did with one eye on the river, ready to bolt the\nmoment Bosambo's canoe came sweeping round the bend.\n\nNow Sanders had particularly warned Mr. Blowter that under no\ncircumstances should he sleep ashore. He gave a variety of reasons, such\nas the prevalence of Beri-Beri, the insidious spread of sleeping\nsickness, the irritation of malaria-bearing mosquitoes, and of other\ninsects which it would be impolite to mention in the pages of a family\njournal.\n\nBut Notiki had built a new hut as he said especially for his guest, and\nMr. Blowter, no doubt, honoured by the attention which was shown to him,\nbroke the restricting rule that Sanders had laid down, quitted the\ncomfortable cabin which had been his home on the river journey, and\nslept in the novel surroundings of a native hut.\n\nHow long he slept cannot be told; he was awakened by a tight hand\ngrasping his throat, and a fierce voice whispering into his ear\nsomething which he rightly understood to be an admonition, a warning and\na threat.\n\nAt any rate, he interpreted it as a request on the part of his captor\nthat he should remain silent, and to this Mr. Blowter in a blue funk\npassively agreed. Three men caught him and bound him deftly with native\nrope, a gag was put into his mouth, and he was dragged cautiously\nthrough a hole which the intruders had cut in the walls of Notiki's\ndwelling of honour. Outside the hut door was a Houssa sentry and it must\nbe confessed that he was not awake at the moment of Mr. Blowter's\ndeparture.\n\nHis captors spirited him by back ways to the river, dumped him into a\ncanoe and paddled with frantic haste to the other shore.\n\nThey grounded their canoe, pulled him--inwardly quaking--to land, and\nhurried him to the forest. On their way they met a huntsman who had been\nout overnight after a leopard, and in the dark of the dawn the chief of\nthose who had captured Mr. Blowter addressed the startled man.\n\n\"Go you to the city of Ochori,\" he said, \"and say 'Mimbimi, the high\nchief who is lord of the forest of Bim-bi, sends word that he has taken\nthe fat white lord to his keeping, and he shall hold him for his\npleasure.'\"\n\n\nVI\n\nIt would appear from all the correspondence which was subsequently\npublished that Sanders had particularly warned Mr. Blowter against\nvisiting the interior, that Sir Robert, that amiable man, had also\nexpressed a warning, and that the august Government itself had sent a\nlong and expensive telegram from Downing Street suggesting that a trip\nto the Ochori country was inadvisable in the present state of public\nfeeling.\n\nThe hasty disposition on the part of certain Journals to blame Mr.\nCommissioner Sanders and his immediate superior for the kidnapping of so\nimportant a person as a Cabinet Minister was obviously founded upon an\nignorance of the circumstances.\n\nYet Sanders felt himself at fault, as a conscientious man always will,\nif he has had the power to prevent a certain happening.\n\nThose loyal little servants of Government, carrier pigeons--went\nfluttering east, south and north, a missionary steamer was hastily\nrequisitioned, and Sanders embarked for the scene of the disappearance.\n\nBefore he left he telegraphed to every likely coast town for Bosambo.\n\n\"If that peregrinating devil had not left his country this would not\nhave happened,\" said Sanders irritably; \"he must come back and help me\nfind the lost one.\"\n\nBefore any answer could come to his telegrams he had embarked, and it is\nperhaps as well that he did not wait, since none of the replies were\nparticularly satisfactory. Bosambo was evidently un-get-at-able, and the\nmost alarming rumour of all was that which came from Sierra Leone and\nwas to the effect that Bosambo had embarked for England with the\nexpressed intention of seeking an interview with a very high personage\nindeed.\n\nNow it is the fact that had Sanders died in the execution of his duty,\ndied either from fever or as the result of scientific torturing at the\nhands of Akasava braves, less than a couple of lines in the London Press\nwould have paid tribute to the work he had done or the terrible manner\nof his passing.\n\nBut a Cabinet Minister, captured by a cannibal tribe, offers in addition\nto alliterative possibilities in the headline department, a certain\nnovelty particularly appealing to the English reader who loves above all\nthings to have a shock or two with his breakfast bacon. England was\nshocked to its depths by the unusual accident which had occurred to the\nRight Honourable gentleman, partly because it is unusual for Cabinet\nMinisters to find themselves in a cannibal's hands, and partly because\nMr. Blowter himself occupied a very large place in the eye of the public\nat home. For the first time in its history the eyes of the world were\nconcentrated on Sanders' territory, and the Press of the world devoted\nimportant columns to dealing not only with the personality of the man\nwho had been stolen, because they knew him well, but more or less\ninaccurately with the man who was charged with his recovery.\n\nThey also spoke of Bosambo \"now on his way to England,\" and it is a fact\nthat a small fleet of motor-boats containing pressmen awaited the\nincoming coast mail at Plymouth only to discover that their man was not\non board.\n\nHappily, Sanders was in total ignorance of the stir which the\ndisappearance created. He knew, of course, that there would be talk\nabout it, and had gloomy visions of long reports to be written. He would\nhave felt happier in his mind if he could have identified Mimbimi with\nany of the wandering chiefs he had met or had known from time to time.\nMimbimi was literally a devil he did not know.\n\nNor could any of the cities or villages which had received a visitation\ngive the Commissioner more definite data than he possessed. Some there\nwere who said that Mimbimi was a tall man, very thin, knobbly at the\nknees, and was wounded in the foot, so that he limped. Others that he\nwas short and very ugly, with a large head and small eyes, and that when\nhe spoke it was in a voice of thunder.\n\nSanders wasted no time in useless inquiries. He threw a cloud of spies\nand trackers into the forest of Bim-bi and began a scientific search;\nsnatching a few hours sleep whenever the opportunity offered. But though\nthe wings of his beaters touched the border line of the Ochori on the\nright and the Isisi on the left, and though he passed through places\nwhich hitherto had been regarded as impenetrable on account of divers\ndevils, yet he found no trace of the cunning kidnapper, who, if the\ntruth be told, had broken through the lines in the night, dragging an\nunwilling and exasperated member of the British Government at the end\nof a rope fastened about his person.\n\nThen messages began to reach Sanders, long telegrams sent up from\nheadquarters by swift canoe or rewritten on paper as fine as cigarette\npaper and sent in sections attached to the legs of pigeons.\n\nThey were irritating, hectoring, worrying, frantic messages. Not only\nfrom the Government, but from the kidnapped man's friends and relatives;\nfor it seemed that this man had accumulated, in addition to a great deal\nof unnecessary information, quite a large and respectable family circle.\nHamilton came up with a reinforcement of Houssas without achieving any\nnotable result.\n\n\"He has disappeared as if the ground had opened and swallowed him,\" said\nSanders bitterly. \"O! Mimbimi, if I could have you now,\" he said with\npassionate intensity.\n\n\"I am sure you would be very rude to him,\" said Hamilton soothingly. \"He\nmust be somewhere, my dear chap; do you think he has killed the poor old\nbird?\"\n\nSanders shook his head.\n\n\"The lord knows what he has done or what has happened to him,\" he said.\n\nIt was at that moment that the messenger came. The _Zaire_ was tied to\nthe bank of the Upper Isisi on the edge of the forest of Bim-bi, and the\nHoussas were bivouacked on the bank, their red fires gleaming in the\ngathering darkness.\n\nThe messenger came from the forest boldly; he showed no fear of Houssas,\nbut walked through their lines, waving his long stick as a bandmaster\nwill flourish his staff. And when the sentry on the plank that led to\nthe boat had recovered from the shock of seeing the unexpected\napparition, the man was seized and led before the Commissioner.\n\n\"O, man,\" said Sanders, \"who are you and where do you come from? Tell me\nwhat news you bring.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said the man glibly, \"I am Mimbimi's own headman.\"\n\nSanders jumped up from his chair.\n\n\"Mimbimi!\" he said quickly; \"tell me what message you bring from that\nthief!\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said the man, \"he is no thief, but a high prince.\"\n\nSanders was peering at him searchingly.\n\n\"It seems to me,\" he said, \"that you are of the Ochori.\"\n\n\"Lord, I was of the Ochori,\" said the messenger, \"but now I am with\nMimbimi,--his headman, following him through all manners of danger.\nTherefore I have no people or nation--wa! Lord, here is my message.\"\n\nSanders nodded.\n\n\"Go on,\" he said, \"messenger of Mimbimi, and let your news be good for\nme.\"\n\n\"Master,\" said the man, \"I come from the great one of the forest who\nholds all lives in his two hands, and fears not anything that lives or\nmoves, neither devil nor Bim-bi nor the ghosts that walk by night nor\nthe high dragons in the trees----\"\n\n\"Get to your message, my man,\" said Sanders, unpleasantly; \"for I have a\nwhip which bites sharper than the dragons in the trees and moves more\nswiftly than m'shamba.\"\n\nThe man nodded.\n\n\"Thus says Mimbimi,\" he resumed. \"Go you to the place near the Crocodile\nRiver where Sandi sits, say Mimbimi the chief loves him, and because of\nhis love Mimbimi will do a great thing. Also he said,\" the man went on,\n\"and this is the greatest message of all. Before I speak further you\nmust make a book of my words.\"\n\nSanders frowned. It was an unusual request from a native, for his offer\nto be set down in writing. \"You might take a note of this, Hamilton,\" he\nsaid aside, \"though why the deuce he wants a note of this made I cannot\nfor the life of me imagine. Go on, messenger,\" he said more mildly; \"for\nas you see my lord Hamilton makes a book.\"\n\n\"Thus says my lord Mimbimi,\" resumed the man, \"that because of his love\nfor Sandi he would give you the fat white lord whom he has taken, asking\nfor no rods or salt in repayment, but doing this because of his love for\nSandi and also because he is a just and a noble man; therefore do I\ndeliver the fat one into your hands.\"\n\nSanders gasped.\n\n\"Do you speak the truth?\" he asked incredulously.\n\nThe man nodded his head.\n\n\"Where is the fat lord?\" asked Sanders. This was no time for ceremony or\nfor polite euphemistic descriptions even of Cabinet Ministers.\n\n\"Master, he is in the forest, less than the length of the village from\nhere, I have tied him to a tree.\"\n\nSanders raced across the plank and through the Houssa lines, dragging\nthe messenger by the arm, and Hamilton, with a hastily summoned guard,\nfollowed. They found Joseph Blowter tied scientifically to a gum-tree, a\nwedge of wood in his mouth to prevent him speaking, and he was a\nterribly unhappy man. Hastily the bonds were loosed, and the gag\nremoved, and the groaning Cabinet Minister led, half carried to the\n_Zaire_.\n\nHe recovered sufficiently to take dinner that night, was full of his\nadventures, inclined perhaps to exaggerate his peril, pardonably\nexasperated against the man who had led him through so many dangers,\nreal and imaginary. But, above all things, he was grateful to Sanders.\n\nHe acknowledged that he had got into his trouble through no fault of the\nCommissioner.\n\n\"I cannot tell you how sorry I am all this has occurred,\" said Sanders.\n\nIt was after dinner, and Mr. Blowter in a spotless white suit--shaved,\nlooking a little more healthy from his enforced exercise, and certainly\nconsiderably thinner, was in the mood to take an amused view of his\nexperience.\n\n\"One thing I have learnt, Mr. Sanders,\" he said, \"and that is the\nextraordinary respect in which you are held in this country. I never\nspoke of you to this infernal rascal but that he bowed low, and all his\nfollowers with him; why, they almost worship you!\"\n\nIf Mr. Blowter had been surprised by this experience no less surprised\nwas Sanders to learn of it.\n\n\"This is news to me,\" he said dryly.\n\n\"That is your modesty, my friend,\" said the Cabinet Minister with a\nbenign smile. \"I, at any rate, appreciate the fact that but for your\npopularity I should have had short shrift from this murderous\nblackguard.\"\n\nHe went down stream the next morning, the _Zaire_ overcrowded with\nHoussas.\n\n\"I should have liked to have left a party in the forest,\" said Sanders;\n\"I shall not rest until we get this thief Mimbimi by the ear.\"\n\n\"I should not bother,\" said Hamilton dryly; \"the sobering influence of\nyour name seems to be almost as potent as my Houssas.\"\n\n\"Please do not be sarcastic,\" said Sanders sharply, he was unduly\nsensitive on the question of such matters as these. Nevertheless, he was\nhappy at the end of the adventure, though somewhat embarrassed by the\ntelegrams of congratulation which were poured upon him not only from the\nAdministrator but from England.\n\n\"If I had done anything to deserve it I would not mind,\" he said.\n\n\"That is the beauty of reward,\" smiled Hamilton; \"if you deserve things\nyou do not get them, if you do not deserve them they come in cartloads,\nyou have to take the thick with the thin. Think of the telegrams which\nought to have come and did not.\"\n\nThey took farewell of Mr. Blowter on the beach, the surf-boat waiting to\ncarry him to a mail steamer decorated for the occasion with strings of\nflags.\n\n\"There is one question which I would like to ask you,\" said Sanders,\n\"and it is one which for some reason I have forgotten to ask before--can\nyou describe Mimbimi to me so that I may locate him? He is quite unknown\nto us.\"\n\nMr. Blowter frowned thoughtfully.\n\n\"He is difficult to describe! all natives are alike to me,\" he said\nslowly. \"He is rather tall, well-made, good-looking for a native, and\ntalkative.\"\n\n\"Talkative!\" said Sanders quickly.\n\n\"In a way; he can speak a little English,\" said the Cabinet Minister,\n\"and evidently has some sort of religious training, because he spoke of\nMark, and Luke, and the various Apostles as one who had studied possibly\nat a missionary school.\"\n\n\"Mark and Luke,\" almost whispered Sanders, a great light dawning upon\nhim. \"Thank you very much. I think you said he always bowed when my name\nwas mentioned?\"\n\n\"Invariably,\" smiled the Cabinet Minister.\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\" Sanders shook hands.\n\n\"O! by the way, Mr. Sanders,\" said Blowter, turning back from the boat,\n\"I suppose you know that you have been gazetted C.M.G.?\"\n\nSanders flushed red and stammered \"C.M.G.\"\n\n\"It is an indifferent honour for one who has rendered such service to\nthe country as you,\" said the complacent Mr. Blowter profoundly; \"but\nthe Government feel that it is the least they can do for you after your\nunusual effort on my behalf and they have asked me to say to you that\nthey will not be unmindful of your future.\"\n\nHe left Sanders standing as though frozen to the spot.\n\nHamilton was the first to congratulate him.\n\n\"My dear chap, if ever a man deserved the C.M.G. it is you,\" he said.\n\nIt would be absurd to say that Sanders was not pleased. He was certainly\nnot pleased at the method by which it came, but he should have known,\nbeing acquainted with the ways of Governments, that this was the reward\nof cumulative merit. He walked back in silence to the Residency,\nHamilton keeping pace by his side.\n\n\"By the way, Sanders,\" he said, \"I have just had a pigeon-post from the\nriver--Bosambo is back in the Ochori country. Have you any idea how he\narrived there?\"\n\n\"I think I have,\" said Sanders, with a grim little smile, \"and I think I\nshall be calling on Bosambo very soon.\"\n\nBut that was a threat he was never destined to put into execution. That\nsame evening came a wire from Bob.\n\n\"Your leave is granted: Hamilton is to act as Commissioner in your\ntemporary absence. I am sending Lieutenant Francis Augustus Tibbetts to\ntake charge of Houssas.\"\n\n\"And who the devil is Francis Augustus Tibbetts?\" said Sanders and\nHamilton with one voice.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nHAMILTON OF THE HOUSSAS\n\n\nSanders turned to the rail and cast a wistful glance at the low-lying\nshore. He saw one corner of the white Residency, showing through the\nsparse _isisi_ palm at the end of the big garden--a smudge of green on\nyellow from this distance.\n\n\"I hate going--even for six months,\" he said.\n\nHamilton of the Houssas, with laughter in his blue eyes, and his\nfumed-oak face--lean and wholesome it was--all a-twitch, whistled with\ndifficulty.\n\n\"Oh, yes, I shall come back again,\" said Sanders, answering the question\nin the tune. \"I hope things will go well in my absence.\"\n\n\"How can they go well?\" asked Hamilton, gently. \"How can the Isisi live,\nor the Akasava sow his barbarous potatoes, or the sun shine, or the\nriver run when Sandi Sitani is no longer in the land?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't have worried,\" Sanders went on, ignoring the insult, \"if\nthey'd put a good man in charge; but to give a pudden-headed\nsoldier----\"\n\n\"We thank you!\" bowed Hamilton.\n\n\"----with little or no experience----\"\n\n\"An insolent lie--and scarcely removed from an unqualified lie!\"\nmurmured Hamilton.\n\n\"To put him in my place!\" apostrophized Sanders, tilting back his helmet\nthe better to appeal to the heavens.\n\n\"'Orrible! 'Orrible!\" said Hamilton; \"and now I seem to catch the\naccusing eye of the chief officer, which means that he wants me to hop.\nGod bless you, old man!\"\n\nHis sinewy paw caught the other's in a grip that left both hands numb at\nthe finish.\n\n\"Keep well,\" said Sanders in a low voice, his hand on Hamilton's back,\nas they walked to the gangway. \"Watch the Isisi and sit on\nBosambo--especially Bosambo, for he is a mighty slippery devil.\"\n\n\"Leave me to deal with Bosambo,\" said Hamilton firmly, as he skipped\ndown the companion to the big boat that rolled and tumbled under the\ncoarse skin of the ship.\n\n\"I _am_ leaving you,\" said Sanders, with a chuckle.\n\nHe watched the Houssa pick a finnicking way to the stern of the boat;\nsaw the solemn faces of his rowmen as they bent their naked backs,\ngripping their clumsy oars. And to think that they and Hamilton were\ngoing back to the familiar life, to the dear full days he knew! Sanders\ncoughed and swore at himself.\n\n\"Oh, Sandi!\" called the headman of the boat, as she went lumbering over\nthe clear green swell, \"remember us, your servants!\"\n\n\"I will remember, man,\" said Sanders, a-choke, and turned quickly to his\ncabin.\n\nHamilton sat in the stern of the surf-boat, humming a song to himself;\nbut he felt awfully solemn, though in his pocket reposed a commission\nsealed redly and largely on parchment and addressed to: \"Our\nwell-beloved Patrick George Hamilton, Lieutenant, of our 133rd 1st Royal\nHertford Regiment. Seconded for service in our 9th Regiment of\nHoussas--Greeting....\"\n\n\"Master,\" said his Kroo servant, who waited his landing, \"you lib for\ndem big house?\"\n\n\"I lib,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"Dem big house,\" was the Residency, in which a temporarily appointed\nCommissioner must take up his habitation, if he is to preserve the\ndignity of his office.\n\n\"Let us pray!\" said Hamilton earnestly, addressing himself to a small\nsnapshot photograph of Sanders, which stood on a side table. \"Let us\npray that the barbarian of his kindness will sit quietly till you\nreturn, my Sanders--for the Lord knows what trouble I'm going to get\ninto before you return!\"\n\nThe incoming mail brought Francis Augustus Tibbetts, Lieutenant of the\nHoussas, raw to the land, but as cheerful as the devil--a straight stick\nof a youth, with hair brushed back from his forehead, a sun-peeled nose,\na wonderful collection of baggage, and all the gossip of London.\n\n\"I'm afraid you'll find I'm rather an ass, sir,\" he said, saluting\nstiffly. \"I've only just arrived on the Coast an' I'm simply bubbling\nover with energy, but I'm rather short in the brain department.\"\n\nHamilton, glaring at his subordinate through his monocle, grinned\nsympathetically.\n\n\"I'm not a whale of erudition myself,\" he confessed. \"What is your name,\nsir?\"\n\n\"Francis Augustus Tibbetts, sir.\"\n\n\"I shall call you Bones,\" said Hamilton, decisively.\n\nLieut. Tibbetts saluted. \"They called me Conk at Sandhurst, sir,\" he\nsuggested.\n\n\"Bones!\" said Hamilton, definitely.\n\n\"Bones it is, skipper,\" said Mr. Tibbetts; \"an' now all this beastly\nformality is over we'll have a bottle to celebrate things.\" And a bottle\nthey had.\n\nIt was a splendid evening they spent, dining on chicken and palm-oil\nchop, rice pudding and sweet potatoes. Hamilton sang, \"Who wouldn't be a\nsoldier in the Army?\" and--by request--in his shaky falsetto baritone,\n\"My heart is in the Highlands\"; and Lieut. Tibbetts gave a lifelike\nimitation of Frank Tinney, which convulsed, not alone his superior\nofficer, but some two-and-forty men of the Houssas who were unauthorized\nspectators through various windows and door cracks and ventilating\ngauzes.\n\nBones was the son of a man who had occupied a position of some\nimportance on the Coast, and though the young man's upbringing had been\nin England, he had the inestimable advantage of a very thorough\ngrounding in the native dialect, not only from Tibbetts, senior, but\nfrom the two native servants with whom the boy had grown up.\n\n\"I suppose there is a telegraph line to headquarters?\" asked Bones that\nnight before they parted.\n\n\"Certainly, my dear lad,\" replied Hamilton. \"We had it laid down when we\nheard you were coming.\"\n\n\"Don't flither!\" pleaded Bones, giggling convulsively; \"but the fact is\nI've got a couple of dozen tickets in the Cambridgeshire Sweepstake, an'\na dear pal of mine--chap named Goldfinder, a rare and delicate bird--has\nsworn to wire me if I've drawn a horse. D'ye think I'll draw a horse?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't think you could draw a cow,\" said Hamilton. \"Go to bed.\"\n\n\"Look here, Ham----\" began Lieut. Bones.\n\n\"To bed! you insubordinate devil!\" said Hamilton, sternly.\n\nIn the meantime there was trouble in the Akasava country.\n\n\nII\n\nScarcely had Sanders left the land, when the _lokali_ of the Lower Isisi\nsent the news thundering in waves of sound.\n\nUp and down the river and from village to village, from town to town,\nacross rivers, penetrating dimly to the quiet deeps of the forest the\nstory was flung. N'gori, the Chief of the Akasava, having some\ngrievance against the Government over a question of fine for failure to\ncollect according to the law, waited for no more than this intelligence\nof Sandi's going. His swift loud drums called his people to a\ndance-of-many-days. A dance-of-many-days spells \"spears\" and spears\nspell trouble. Bosambo heard the message in the still of the early\nnight, gathered five hundred fighting men, swept down on the Akasava\ncity in the drunken dawn, and carried away two thousand spears of the\nsodden N'gori.\n\nA sobered Akasava city woke up and rubbed its eyes to find strange\nOchori sentinels in the street and Bosambo in a sky-blue table-cloth,\nedged with golden fringe, stalking majestically through the high places\nof the city.\n\n\"This I do,\" said Bosambo to a shocked N'gori, \"because my lord Sandi\nplaced me here to hold the king's peace.\"\n\n\"Lord Bosambo,\" said the king sullenly, \"what peace do I break when I\nsummon my young men and maidens to dance?\"\n\n\"Your young men are thieves, and it is written that the maidens of the\nAkasava are married once in ten thousand moons,\" said Bosambo calmly;\n\"and also, N'gori, you speak to a wise man who knows that\nclockety-clock-clock on a drum spells war.\"\n\nThere was a long and embarrassing silence.\n\n\"Now, Bosambo,\" said N'gori, after a while, \"you have my spears and your\nyoung men hold the streets and the river. What will you do? Do you sit\nhere till Sandi returns and there is law in the land?\"\n\nThis was the one question which Bosambo had neither the desire nor the\nability to answer. He might swoop down upon a warlike people, surprising\nthem to their abashment, rendering their armed forces impotent, but\nexactly what would happen afterwards he had not foreseen.\n\n\"I go back to my city,\" he said.\n\n\"And my spears?\"\n\n\"Also they go with me,\" said Bosambo.\n\nThey eyed each other: Bosambo straight and muscular, a perfect figure of\na man, N'gori grizzled and skinny, his brow furrowed with age.\n\n\"Lord,\" said N'gori mildly, \"if you take my spears you leave me bound to\nmy enemies. How may I protect my villages against oppression by evil men\nof Isisi?\"\n\nBosambo sniffed--a sure sign of mental perturbation. All that N'gori\nsaid was true. Yet if he left the spears there would be trouble for him.\nThen a bright thought flicked:\n\n\"If bad men come you shall send for me and I will bring my fine young\nsoldiers. The palaver is finished.\"\n\nWith this course N'gori must feign agreement. He watched the departing\narmy--paddlers sitting on swathes of filched spears. Once Bosambo was\nout of sight, N'gori collected all the convertible property of his city\nand sent it in ten canoes to the edge of the N'gombi country, for\nN'gombi folk are wonderful makers of spears and have a saleable stock\nhidden against emergency.\n\nFor the space of a month there was enacted a comedy of which Hamilton\nwas ignorant. Three days after Bosambo had returned in triumph to his\ncity, there came a frantic call for succour--a rolling, terrified\nrat-a-plan of sound which the _lokali_ man of the Ochori village read.\n\n\"Lord,\" said he, waking Bosambo in the dead of night, \"there has come\ndown a signal from the Akasava, who are pressed by their enemies and\nhave no spears.\"\n\nBosambo was in the dark street instanter, his booming war-drum calling\nurgently. Twenty canoes filled with fighting men, paddling desperately\nwith the stream, raced to the aid of the defenceless Akasava.\n\nAt dawn, on the beach of the city, N'gori met his ally. \"I thank all my\nlittle gods you have come, my lord,\" said he, humbly; \"for in the night\none of my young men saw an Isisi army coming against us.\"\n\n\"Where is the army?\" demanded a weary Bosambo.\n\n\"Lord, it has not come,\" said N'gori, glibly; \"for hearing of your\nlordship and your swift canoes, I think it had run away.\"\n\nBosambo's force paddled back to the Ochori city the next day. Two nights\nafter, the call was repeated--this time with greater detail. An N'gombi\nforce of countless spears had seized the village of Doozani and was\nthreatening the capital.\n\nAgain Bosambo carried his spears to a killing, and again was met by an\napologetic N'gori.\n\n\"Lord, it was a lie which a sick maiden spread,\" he explained, \"and my\nstomach is filled with sorrow that I should have brought the mighty\nBosambo from his wife's bed on such a night.\" For the dark hours had\nbeen filled with rain and tempest, and Bosambo had nearly lost one canoe\nby wreck.\n\n\"Oh, fool!\" said he, justly exasperated, \"have I nothing to do--I, who\nhave all Sandi's high and splendid business in hand--but I must come\nthrough the rain because a sick maiden sees visions?\"\n\n\"Bosambo, I am a fool,\" agreed N'gori, meekly, and again his rescuer\nreturned home.\n\n\"Now,\" said N'gori, \"we will summon a secret palaver, sending messengers\nfor all men to assemble at the rise of the first moon. For the N'gombi\nhave sent me new spears, and when next the dog Bosambo comes, weary with\nrowing, we will fall upon him and there will be no more Bosambo left;\nfor Sandi is gone and there is no law in the land.\"\n\n\nIII\n\nCuriously enough, at that precise moment, the question of law was a very\npressing one with two young Houssa officers who sat on either side of\nSanders' big table, wet towels about their heads, mastering the\nintricacies of the military code; for Tibbetts was entering for an\nexamination and Hamilton, who had only passed his own by a fluke, had\nrashly offered to coach him.\n\n\"I hope you understand this, Bones,\" said Hamilton, staring up at his\nsubordinate and running his finger along the closely printed pages of\nthe book before him.\n\n\"'Any person subject to military law,'\" read Hamilton impressively,\n\"'who strikes or ill-uses his superior officer shall, if an officer,\nsuffer death or such less punishment as in this Act mentioned.' Which\nmeans,\" said Hamilton, wisely, \"that if you and I are in action and you\ncall me a liar, and I give you a whack on the jaw----\"\n\n\"You get shot,\" said Bones, admiringly, \"an' a rippin' good idea, too!\"\n\n\"If, on the other hand,\" Hamilton went on, \"I called you a liar--which I\nshould be justified in doing--and you give me a whack on the jaw, I'd\nmake you sorry you were ever born.\"\n\n\"That's military law, is it?\" asked Bones, curiously.\n\n\"It is,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"Then let's chuck it,\" said Bones, and shut up his book with a bang. \"I\ndon't want any book to teach me what to do with a feller that calls me a\nliar. I'll go you one game of picquet, for nuts.\"\n\n\"You're on,\" said Hamilton.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"My nuts I think, sir.\"\n\nBones carefully counted the heap which his superior had pushed over,\n\"And--hullo! what the dooce do you want?\"\n\nHamilton followed the direction of the other's eyes. A man stood in the\ndoorway, naked but for the wisp of skirt at his waist. Hamilton got up\nquickly, for he recognized the chief of Sandi's spies.\n\n\"O Kelili,\" said Hamilton in his easy Bomongo tongue, \"why do you come\nand from whence?\"\n\n\"From the island over against the Ochori, Lord,\" croaked the man,\ndry-throated. \"Two pigeons I sent, but these the hawks took--a fisherman\nsaw one taken by the Kasai, and my own brother, who lives in the Village\nof Irons, saw the other go--though he flew swiftly.\"\n\nHamilton's grave face set rigidly, for he smelt trouble. You do not send\npleasant news by pigeons.\n\n\"Speak,\" he said.\n\n\"Lord,\" said Kelili, \"there is to be a killing palaver between the\nOchori and the Akasava on the first rise of the full moon, for N'gori\nspeaks of Bosambo evilly, and says that the Chief has raided him. In\nwhat manner these things will come about,\" Kelili went on, with the\nlofty indifference of one who had done his part of the business, so that\nhe had left no room for carelessness, \"I do not know, but I have warned\nall eyes of the Government to watch.\"\n\nBones followed the conversation without difficulty.\n\n\"What do people say?\" asked Hamilton.\n\n\"Lord, they say that Sandi has gone and there is no law.\"\n\nHamilton of the Houssas grinned. \"Oh, ain't there?\" said he, in English,\nvilely.\n\n\"Ain't there?\" repeated an indignant Bones, \"we'll jolly well show old\nThinggumy what's what.\"\n\nBosambo received an envoy from the Chief of the Akasava, and the envoy\nbrought with him presents of dubious value and a message to the effect\nthat N'gori spent much of his waking moments in wondering how he might\nbest serve his brother Bosambo, \"The right arm on which I and my people\nlean and the bright eyes through which I see beauty.\"\n\nBosambo returned the messenger, with presents more valueless, and an\nassurance of friendship more sonorous, more complete in rhetoric and\naptness of hyperbole, and when the messenger had gone Bosambo showed his\nappreciation of N'gori's love by doubling the guard about the Ochori\ncity and sending a strong picket under his chief headman to hold the\nriver bend.\n\n\"Because,\" said this admirable philosopher, \"life is like certain roots:\nsome that taste sweet and are bitter in the end, and some that are vile\nto the lips and pleasant to the stomach.\"\n\nIt was a wild night, being in the month of rains. M'shimba M'shamba was\nabroad, walking with his devastating feet through the forest, plucking\nup great trees by their roots and tossing them aside as though they\nwere so many canes. There was a roaring of winds and a crashing of\nthunders, and the blue-white lightning snicked in and out of the forest\nor tore sprawling cracks in the sky. In the Ochori city they heard the\nstorm grumbling across the river and were awakened by the incessant\nlightning--so incessant that the weaver birds who lived in palms that\nfringed the Ochori streets came chattering to life.\n\nIt was too loud a noise, that M'shimba M'shamba made for the _lokali_\nman of the Ochori to hear the message that N'gori sent--the\npanic-message designed to lure Bosambo to the newly-purchased spears.\n\nBones heard it--Bones, standing on the bridge of the _Zaire_ pounding\naway upstream, steaming past the Akasava city in a sheet of rain.\n\n\"Wonder what the jolly old row is?\" he muttered to himself, and summoned\nhis sergeant. \"Ali,\" said he, in faultless Arabic, \"what beating of\ndrums are these?\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said the sergeant, uneasily, \"I do not know, unless they be to\nwarn us not to travel at night. I am your man, Master,\" said he in a\nfret, \"yet never have I travelled with so great a fear: even our Lord\nSandi does not move by night, though the river is his own child.\"\n\n\"It is written,\" said Bones, cheerfully, and as the sergeant saluted and\nturned away, the reckless Houssa made a face at the darkness. \"If old\nman Ham would give me a month or two on the river,\" he mused, \"I'd set\n'em alight, by Jove!\"\n\nBy the miraculous interposition of Providence Bones reached the Ochori\nvillage in the grey clouded dawn, and Bosambo, early astir, met the lank\nfigure of the youth, his slick sword dangling, his long revolver holster\nstrapped to his side, and his helmet on the back of his head, an eager\nwarrior looking for trouble.\n\n\"Lord, of you I have heard,\" said Bosambo, politely; \"here in the Ochori\ncountry we talk of no other thing than the new, thin Lord whose\nbeautiful nose is like the red flowers of the forest.\"\n\n\"Leave my nose alone,\" said Bones, unpleasantly, \"and tell me, Chief,\nwhat killing palaver is this I hear? I come from Government to right all\nwrongs--this is evidently his nibs, Bosambo.\" The last passage was in\nhis own native tongue and Bosambo beamed.\n\n\"Yes, sah!\" said he in the English of the Coast. \"I be Bosambo, good\nchap, fine chap; you, sah, you look um--you see um--Bosambo!\"\n\nHe slapped his chest and Bones unbent.\n\n\"Look here, old sport,\" he said affably: \"what the dooce is all this\nshindy about--hey?\"\n\n\"No shindy, sah!\" said Bosambo--being sure that all people of his city\nwere standing about at a respectful distance, awe-stricken by the sight\nof their chief on equal terms with this new white lord.\n\n\"Dem feller he lib for Akasava, sah--he be bad feller: I be good\nfeller, sah--C'istian, sah! Matt'ew, Marki, Luki, Johni--I savvy dem\nfine.\"\n\nHappily, Bones continued the conversation in the tongue of the land.\nThen he learned of the dance which Bosambo had frustrated, of the spears\ntaken, and these he saw stacked in three huts.\n\nBones, despite the character he gave himself, was no fool, and,\nmoreover, he had the advantage of knowing of the new N'gombi spears that\nwere going out to the Akasava day by day; and when Bosambo told of the\nmidnight summons that had come to him, Bones did the rapid exercise of\nmental figuring which is known as putting two and two together.\n\nHe wagged his head when Bosambo had finished his recital, did this\ngeneral of twenty-one. \"You're a jolly old sportsman, Bosambo,\" he said\nvery seriously, \"and you're in the dooce of a hole, if you only knew it.\nBut you trust old Bones--he'll see you through. By Gad!\"\n\nBosambo, bewildered but resourceful, hearing, without understanding,\nreplied: \"I be fine feller, sah!\"\n\n\"You bet your life you are, old funnyface,\" agreed Bones, and screwed\nhis eyeglass in the better to survey his prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n\n\nIV\n\nChief N'gori organized a surprise party for Bosambo, and took so much\ntrouble with the details, that, because of his sheer thoroughness, he\ndeserved to have succeeded. _Lokali_ men concealed in the bush were\nwaiting to announce the coming of the rescue party, when N'gori sent his\ncry for help crashing across the world. Six hundred spearmen stood ready\nto embark in fifty canoes, and five hundred more waited on either bank\nready to settle with any survivors of the Ochori who found their way to\nland.\n\nThe best of plans are subject to the banal reservation, \"weather\npermitting,\" and the signal intended to bring Bosambo to his destruction\nwas swallowed up in the bellowings of the storm.\n\n\"This night being fine,\" said N'gori, showing his teeth, \"Bosambo will\nsurely come.\"\n\nHis Chief Counsellor, an ancient man of the royal tribe,[2] had\nunexpected warnings to offer. A man had seen a man, who had caught a\nglimpse of the _Zaire_ butting her way upstream in the dead of night.\nWas it wise, when the devil Sandi waited to smite, and so close at hand,\nto engage in so high an adventure?\n\n[Footnote 2: That which I call the Akasava proper is the very small,\ndominant clan of a tribe which is loosely called \"Akasava,\" but is\nreally Bowongo.]\n\n\"Old man, there is a hut in the forest for you,\" said N'gori, with\nsignificance, and the Counsellor wilted, because the huts in the forest\nare for the sick, the old, and the mad, and here they are left to starve\nand die; \"for,\" N'gori went on, \"all men know that Sandi has gone to his\npeople across the black waters, and the M'ilitani rules. Also, in\nnights of storms there are men who see even devils.\"\n\nWith more than ordinary care he prepared for the final settling with\nBosambo the Robber, and there is a suggestion that he was encouraged by\nthe chiefs of other lands, who had grown jealous of the Ochori and their\noffensive rectitude. Be that as it may, all things were made ready, even\nto the knives of sacrifice and the young saplings which had not been\nemployed by the Akasava for their grisly work since the Year of\nHangings.\n\nAt an hour before midnight the tireless _lokali_ sent out its call:\n\n     \"We of the Akasava\"                  (four long rolls and a quick\n                                          succession of taps)\n\n     \"Danger threatens\"                   (a long roll, a short roll,\n                                          and a triple tap-tap)\n\n     \"Isisi fighting\"                     (rolls punctuated by shorter\n                                          tattoos)\n\n     \"Come to me\"                         (a long crescendo roll and\n                                          patter of taps)\n\n     \"Ochori\"                             (nine rolls, curiously like\n                                          the yelping of a dog)\n\nSo the message went out: every village heard and repeated. The Isisi\nthrew the call northward; the N'gombi village, sent it westward, and\npresently first the Isisi, then the N'gombi, heard the faint answer:\n\"Coming--the Breaker of Lives,\" and returned the message to N'gori.\n\n\"Now I shall also break lives,\" said N'gori, and sacrificed a goat to\nhis success.\n\nSixteen hundred fighting men waited for the signal from the hidden\n_lokali_ player, on the far side of the river bend. At the first hollow\nrattle of his sticks, N'gori pushed off in his royal canoe.\n\n\"Kill!\" he roared, and went out in the white light of dawn to greet ten\nOchori canoes, riding in fanshape formation, having as their centre a\nwhite and speckless _Zaire_ alive with Houssas and overburdened with the\nslim muzzles of Hotchkiss guns.\n\n\"Oh, Ko!\" said N'gori dismally, \"this is a bad palaver!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the centre of his city, before a reproving squad of Houssas, a dumb\nman, taken in the act of armed aggression, N'gori stood.\n\n\"You're a naughty boy,\" said Bones, reproachfully, \"and if jolly old\nSanders were here--my word, you'd catch it!\"\n\nN'gori listened to the unknown tongue, worried by its mystery. \"Lord,\nwhat happens to me?\" he asked.\n\nBones looked very profound and scratched his head. He looked at the\nChief, at Bosambo, at the river all aglow in the early morning sunlight,\nat the _Zaire_, with her sinister guns a-glitter, and then back at the\nChief. He was not well versed in the dialect of the Akasava, and Bosambo\nmust be his interpreter.\n\n\"Very serious offence, old friend,\" said Bones, solemnly; \"awfully\nserious--muckin' about with spears and all that sort of thing. I'll have\nto make a dooce of an example of you--yes, by Heaven!\"\n\nBosambo heard and imperfectly understood. He looked about for a likely\ntree where an unruly chief might sway with advantage to the community.\n\n\"You're a bad, bad boy,\" said Bones, shaking his head; \"tell him.\"\n\n\"Yes, sah!\" said Bosambo.\n\n\"Tell him he's fined ten dollars.\"\n\nBut Bosambo did not speak: there are moments too full for words and this\nwas one of them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE DISCIPLINARIANS\n\n\nLieutenant Augustus Tibbetts of the Houssas stood at attention before\nhis chief. He stood as straight as a ramrod, his hands to his sides, his\neyeglass jammed in his eye, and Hamilton of the Houssas looked at him\nsorrowfully.\n\n\"Bones, you're an ass!\" he said at last.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Bones.\n\n\"I sent you to Ochori to prevent a massacre, you catch a chief in the\nact of ambushing an enemy and instead of chucking him straight into the\nVillage of Iron you fine him ten dollars.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Bones.\n\nThere was a painful pause.\n\n\"Well, you're an ass!\" said Hamilton, who could think of nothing better\nto say.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Bones; \"I think you're repeating yourself, sir. I seem\nto have heard a similar observation before.\"\n\n\"You've made Bosambo and the whole of the Ochori as sick as monkeys, and\nyou've made me look a fool.\"\n\n\"Hardly my responsibility, sir,\" said Bones, gently.\n\n\"I hardly know what to do with you,\" said Hamilton, drawing his pipe\nfrom his pocket and slowly charging it. \"Naturally, Bones, I can never\nlet you loose again on the country.\" He lit his pipe and puffed\nthoughtfully. \"And of course----\"\n\n\"Pardon me, sir,\" said Bones, still uncomfortably erect, \"this is\nintended to be a sort of official inquiry an' all that sort of thing,\nisn't it?\"\n\n\"It is,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said Bones, \"may I ask you not to smoke? When a chap's\nhonour an' reputation an' all that sort of thing is being weighed in the\nbalance, sir, believe me, smokin' isn't decent--it isn't really, sir.\"\n\nHamilton looked round for something to throw at his critic and found a\ntolerably heavy book, but Bones dodged and fielded it dexterously. \"And\nif you must chuck things at me, sir,\" he added, as he examined the title\non the back of the missile, \"will you avoid as far as possible usin' the\nsacred volumes of the Army List? It hurts me to tell you this, sir, but\nI've been well brought up.\"\n\n\"What's the time?\" asked Hamilton, and his second-in-command examined\nhis watch.\n\n\"Ten to tiffin,\" he said. \"Good Lord, we've been gassin' an hour. Any\nnews from Sanders?\"\n\n\"He's in town--that's all I know--but don't change the serious subject,\nBones. Everybody is awfully disgusted with you--Sanders would have at\nleast brought him to trial.\"\n\n\"I couldn't do it, sir,\" said Bones, firmly. \"Poor old bird! He looked\nsuch an ass, an' moreover reminded me so powerfully of an aunt of mine\nthat I simply couldn't do it.\"\n\nNo doubt but that Lieut. Francis Augustus Tibbetts of the Houssas, with\nhis sun-burnt nose, his large saucer eyes, and his air of solemn\ninnocence, had shaken the faith of the impressionable folk. This much\nHamilton was to learn: for Tibbetts had been sent with a party of\nHoussas to squash effectively an incipient rebellion in the Akasava, and\nhaving caught N'gori in the very act of most treacherously and most\ndamnably preparing an ambush for a virtuous Bosambo, Chief of the\nOchori, had done no more than fine him ten dollars.\n\nAnd this was in a land where even the Spanish dollar had never been seen\nsave by Bosambo, who was reported to have more than his share of silver\nin a deep hole beneath the floor of his hut.\n\nSmall wonder that Captain Hamilton held an informal court-martial of\none, the closing stages of which I have described, and sentenced his\nwholly inefficient subordinate to seven days' field exercise in the\nforest with half a company of Houssas.\n\n\"Oh, dash it, you don't mean that?\" asked Bones in dismay when the\nfinding of the court was conveyed to him at lunch.\n\n\"I do,\" said Hamilton firmly. \"I'd be failing in my job of work if I\ndidn't make you realize what a perfect ass you are.\"\n\n\"Perfect--yes,\" protested Bones, \"ass--no. Fact is, dear old fellow,\nI've a temperament. You aren't going to make me go about in that\nbeastly forest diggin' rifle pits an' pitchin' tents an' all that sort\nof dam' nonsense; it's too grisly to think about.\"\n\n\"None the less,\" said Hamilton, \"you will do it whilst I go north to sit\non the heads of all who endeavour to profit by your misguided leniency.\nI shall be back in time for the Administration Inspection--don't for the\nlove of heaven forget that His Excellency----\"\n\n\"Bless his jolly old heart!\" murmured Bones.\n\n\"That His Excellency is paying his annual visit on the twenty-first.\"\n\nA ray of hope shot through the gloom of Lieut. Tibbetts' mind.\n\n\"Under the circumstances, dear old friend, don't you think it would be\nbest to chuck that silly idea of field training? What about sticking up\na board and gettin' the chaps to paint, 'Welcome to the United\nTerritories,' or 'God bless our Home,' or something.\"\n\nHamilton withered him with a glance.\n\nHis last words, shouted from the bridge of the _Zaire_ as her stern\nwheel went threshing ahead, were, \"Remember, Bones! No shirking!\"\n\n_\"Honi soit qui mal y pense_!\" roared Bones.\n\n\nII\n\nHamilton had evidence enough of the effect which the leniency of his\nsubordinate had produced. News travels fast, and the Akasava are great\ntalkers. Hamilton, coming to the Isisi city on his way up the river,\nfound a crowd on the beach to watch his mooring, their arms folded\nhugging their sides--sure gesture of indifferent idleness--but neither\nthe paramount chief, nor his son, nor any of his counsellors awaited the\nsteamer to pay their respects.\n\nHamilton sent for them and still they did not come, sending a message\nthat they were sick. So Hamilton went striding through the street of the\ncity, his long sword flapping at his side, four Houssas padding swiftly\nin his rear at their curious jog-trot. B'sano, the young chief of the\nIsisi, came out lazily from his hut and stood with outstretched feet and\narms akimbo watching the nearing Houssa, and he had no fear, for it was\nsaid that now Sandi was away from the country no man had the authority\nto punish.\n\nAnd the counsellors behind B'sano had their bunched spears and their\nwicker-work shields, contrary to all custom--as Sanders had framed the\ncustom.\n\n\"O chief,\" said Hamilton, with that ready smile of his, \"I waited for\nyou and you did not come.\"\n\n\"Soldier,\" said B'sano, insolently, \"I am the king of these people and\nanswerable to none save my lord Sandi, who, as you know, is gone from\nus.\"\n\n\"That I know,\" said the patient Houssa, \"and because it is in my heart\nto show all people what manner of law Sandi has left behind, I fine you\nand your city ten thousand _matakos_ that you shall remember that the\nlaw lives, though Sandi is in the moon, though all rulers change and\ndie.\"\n\nA slow gleam of contempt came to the chief's eyes.\n\n\"Soldier,\" said he, \"I do not pay _matako--wa_!\"\n\nHe stumbled back, his mouth agape with fear. The long barrel of\nHamilton's revolver rested coldly on his bare stomach.\n\n\"We will have a fire,\" said Hamilton, and spoke to his sergeant in\nArabic. \"Here in the centre of the city we will make a fire of proud\nshields and unlawful spears.\"\n\nOne by one the counsellors dropped their wicker shields upon the fire\nwhich the Houssa sergeant had kindled, and as they dropped them, the\nsergeant scientifically handcuffed the advisers of the Isisi chief in\ncouples.\n\n\"You shall find other counsellors, B'sano,\" said Hamilton, as the men\nwere led to the _Zaire_. \"See that I do not come bringing with me a new\nchief.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said the chief humbly, \"I am your dog.\"\n\nNot alone was B'sano at fault. Up and down the road old grievances\nawaited settlement: there were scores to adjust, misunderstandings to\nremove. Mostly these misunderstandings had to do with important\nquestions of tribal superiority and might only be definitely tested by\nsanguinary combat.\n\nAlso picture a secret order, ruthlessly suppressed by Sanders, and\npractised by trembling men, each afraid of the other despite their\noaths; and the fillip it received when the news went forth--\"Sandi has\ngone--there is no law.\"\n\nThis was a fine time for the dreamers of dreams and for the men who saw\nportends and understood the wisdom of Ju-jus.\n\nBemebibi, chief of the Lesser Isisi, was too fat a man for a dreamer,\nfor visions run with countable ribs and a cough. Nor was he tall nor\ncommanding by any standard. He had broad shoulders and a short neck. His\nhead was round, and his eyes were cunning and small. He was an irritable\nman, had a trick of beating his counsellors when they displeased him,\nand was a ready destroyer of men.\n\nSome say that he practised sacrifice in the forests, he and the members\nof his society, but none spoke with any certainty or authority, for\nBemebibi was chief, alike of a community and an order. In the Lesser\nIsisi alone, the White Ghosts had flourished in spite of every effort of\nthe Administration to stamp them out.\n\nIt was a society into which the hazardous youth of the Isisi were\ninitiated joyfully, for there is little difference in the temperament of\nyouth, whether it wears a cloth about its loins or lavender spats upon\nits feet.\n\nThus it came about that one-half of the adult male population of the\nLesser Isisi, had sworn by the letting of blood and the rubbing of salt:\n\n     (1) To hop upon one foot for a spear's length every night and\n         morning.\n\n     (2) To love all ghosts and speak gently of devils.\n\n     (3) To be dumb and blind and to throw spears swiftly for the love\n         of the White Ghosts.\n\nOne night Bemebibi went into the forest with six highmen of his order.\nThey came to a secret place at a pool, and squatted in a circle, each\nman laying his hands on the soles of his feet in the prescribed fashion.\n\n\"Snakes live in holes,\" said Bemebibi conventionally. \"Ghosts dwell by\nwater and all devils sit in the bodies of little birds.\"\n\nThis they repeated after him, moving their heads from side to side\nslowly.\n\n\"This is a good night,\" said the chief, when the ritual was ended, \"for\nnow I see the end of our great thoughts. Sandi is gone and M'ilitini is\nby the place where the three rivers meet, and he has come in fear. Also\nby magic I have learnt that he is terrified because he knows me to be an\nawful man. Now, I think, it is time for all ghosts to strike swiftly.\"\n\nHe spoke with emotion, swaying his body from side to side after the\nmanner of orators. His voice grew thick and husky as the immensity of\nhis design grew upon him.\n\n\"There is no law in the land,\" he sang. \"Sandi has gone, and only a\nlittle, thin man punishes in fear. M'ilitini has blood like water--let\nus sacrifice.\"\n\nOne of his highmen disappeared into the dark forest and came back soon,\ndragging a half-witted youth, named Ko'so, grinning and mumbling and\ncontent till the curved N'gombi knife, that his captor wielded, came\n\"snack\" to his neck and then he spoke no more.\n\nToo late Hamilton came through the forest with his twenty Houssas.\nBemebibi saw the end and was content to make a fight for it, as were his\npartners in crime.\n\n\"Use your bayonets,\" said Hamilton briefly, and flicked out his long,\nwhite sword. Bemebibi lunged at him with his stabbing spear, and\nHamilton caught the poisoned spearhead on the steel guard, touched it\naside, and drove forward straight and swiftly from his shoulder.\n\n\"Bury all these men,\" said Hamilton, and spent a beastly night in the\nforest.\n\nSo passed Bemebibi, and his people gave him up to the ghosts, him and\nhis highmen.\n\nThere were other problems less tragic, to be dealt with, a Bosambo\nrather grieved than sulking, a haughty N'gori to be kicked to a sense of\nhis unimportance, chiefs, major and minor, to be brought into a\ncondition of penitence.\n\nHamilton went zigzagging up the river swiftly. He earned for himself in\nthose days the name of \"Dragon-fly,\" or its native equivalent, and the\nillustration was apt, for it seemed that the _Zaire_ would poise,\nbuzzing angrily, then dart off in unexpected directions, and the spirit\nof complacency which had settled upon the land gave place to one of\napprehension, which, in the old days, followed the arrival of Sanders in\na mood of reprisal.\n\nHamilton sent a letter by canoe to his second-in-command. It started\nsimply:\n\n\"Bones--I will not call you 'dear Bones,'\" it went on with a hint of the\nrancour in the writer's heart, \"for you are not dear to me. I am\nstriving to clear up the mess you have made so that when His Excellency\narrives I shall be able to show him a law-abiding country. I have missed\nyou, Bones, but had you been near on more occasion than one, I should\nnot have missed you. Bones, were you ever kicked as a boy? Did any good\nfellow ever get you by the scruff of your neck and the seat of your\ntrousers and chuck you into an evil-smelling pond? Try to think and send\nme the name of the man who did this, that I may send him a letter of\nthanks.\n\n\"Your absurd weakness has kept me on the move for days. Oh, Bones,\nBones! I am in a sweat, lest even now you are tampering with the\ndiscipline of my Houssas--lest you are handing round tea and cake to the\nAlis and Ahmets and Mustaphas of my soldiers; lest you are brightening\ntheir evenings with imitations of Frank Tinney and fanning the flies\nfrom their sleeping forms,\" the letter went on.\n\n\"Cad!\" muttered Bones, as he read this bit.\n\nThere were six pages couched in this strain, and at the end six more of\ninstruction. Bones was in the forest when the letter came to him,\nunshaven, weary, and full of trouble.\n\nHe hated work, he loathed field exercise, he regarded bridge-building\nover imaginary streams, and the whole infernal curriculum of military\ntraining, as being peculiarly within the province of the boy scouts and\nwholly beneath the dignity of an officer of the Houssas. And he felt\nhorribly guilty as he read Hamilton's letter, for the night before it\ncame he had most certainly entertained his company with a banjo\nrendering of the Soldiers' Chorus from \"Faust.\"\n\nHe rumpled his beautiful hair, jammed down his helmet, squared his\nshoulders, and, with a fiendish expression on his face--an expression\nintended by Bones to represent a stern, unbending devotion to duty, he\nstepped forth from his tent determined to undo what mischief he had\ndone, and earn, if not the love, at least the respect of his people.\n\n\nIII\n\nThere is in all services a subtle fear and hope. They have to do less\nwith material consequence than with a sense of harmony which rejects the\ndiscordance of failure. Also Hamilton was a human man, who, whilst he\nrespected Sanders and had a profound regard for his qualities, nourished\na secret faith that he might so carry on the work of the heaven-born\nCommissioner without demanding the charity of his superiors.\n\nHe wished--not unnaturally--to spread a triumphant palm to his country\nand say \"Behold! There are the talents that Sanders left--I have\nincreased them, by my care, twofold.\"\n\nHe came down stream in some haste having completed the work of\npacification and stopped at the Village of Irons long enough to hand to\nthe Houssa warder four unhappy counsellors of the Isisi king.\n\n\"Keep these men for service against our lord Sandi's return.\"\n\nAt Bosinkusu he was delayed by a storm, a mad, whirling brute of a storm\nthat lashed the waters of the river and swept the _Zaire_ broadside on\ntowards the shore. At M'idibi, the villagers, whose duty it was to cut\nand stack wood for the Government steamers, had gone into a forest to\nmeet a celebrated witch doctor, gambling on the fact that there was\nanother wooding village ten miles down stream and that Hamilton would\nchoose that for the restocking of his boat.\n\nSo that beyond a thin skeleton pile of logs on the river's edge--set up\nto deceive the casual observer as he passed and approved of their\nindustry--there was no wood and Hamilton had to set his men to\nwood-cutting.\n\nHe had nearly completed the heart-breaking work when the villagers\nreturned in a body, singing an unmusical song and decked about with\nropes of flowers.\n\n\"Now,\" explained the headman, \"we have been to a palaver with a holy man\nand he has promised us that some day there will come to us a great\nharvest of corn which will be reaped by magic and laid at our doors\nwhilst we sleep.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said the exasperated Houssa, \"promise you a great harvest of\nwhips that, so far from coming in your sleep, will keep you awake.\"\n\n\"Master, we did not know that you would come so soon,\" said the humble\nheadman; \"also there was a rumour that your lordship had been drowned in\nthe storm and your _puc-a-puc_ sunk, and my young men were happy because\nthere would be no more wood to cut.\"\n\nThe _Zaire_, fuel replenished, slipped down the river, Hamilton leaning\nover the rail promising unpleasant happenings as the boat drifted out\nfrom the faithless village. He had cut things very fine, and could do no\nmore than hope that he would reach headquarters an hour or so before the\nAdministrator arrived by the mail-boat. If Bones could be trusted there\nwould be no cause for worry. Bones should have the men's quarters\nwhitewashed, the parade ground swept and garnished, and stores in\nexcellent order for inspection, and all the books on hand for the\nAccountant-General to glance over.\n\nBut Bones!\n\nHamilton writhed internally at the thought of Francis Augustus and his\ninefficiency.\n\nHe had sent his second the most elaborate instructions, but if he knew\nhis man, the languid Bones would do no more than pass those instructions\non to a subordinate.\n\nIt was ten o'clock on the morning of the inspection that the _Zaire_\ncame paddling furiously to the tiny concrete quay, and Hamilton gave a\nsigh of relief. For there, awaiting him, stood Lieutenant Tibbetts in\nthe glory of his raiment--helmet sparkling white, steel hilt of sword\na-glitter, khaki uniform, spotless and well-fitting.\n\n\"Everything is all right, sir,\" said Bones, saluting, and Hamilton\nthought he detected a gruffer and more robust note in the tone.\n\n\"Mail-boat's just in, sir,\" Bones went on with unusual fierceness.\n\"You're in time to meet His Excellency. Stores all laid out, books in\ntrim, parade ground and quarters whitewashed as per your jolly old\norders, sir.\"\n\nHe saluted again, his eyes bulging, his face a veritable mask of\nferocity, and, turning on his heel, he led the way to the beach.\n\n\"Here, hold hard!\" said Hamilton; \"what the dickens is the matter with\nyou?\"\n\n\"Seen the error of my ways, sir,\" growled Bones, again saluting\npunctiliously. \"I've been an ass, sir--too lenient--given you a lot of\ntrouble--shan't occur again.\"\n\nThere was not time to ask any further questions.\n\nThe two men had to run to reach the landing place in time, for the surf\nboats were at that moment rolling to the yellow beach.\n\nSir Robert Sanleigh, in spotless white, was carried ashore, and his\nstaff followed.\n\n\"Ah, Hamilton,\" said the great Bob, \"everything all right?\"\n\n\"Yes, your Excellency,\" said Hamilton, \"there have been one or two\nserious killing palavers on which I will report.\"\n\nSir Robert nodded.\n\n\"You were bound to have a little trouble as soon as Sanders went,\" he\nsaid.\n\nHe was a methodical man and had little time for the work at hand, for\nthe mail-boat was waiting to carry him to another station. Books,\nquarters, and stores were in apple-pie order, and inwardly Hamilton\nraised his voice in praise of the young man, who strode silently and\nfiercely by his side, his face still distorted with a new-found\nfierceness.\n\n\"The Houssas are all right, I suppose?\" asked Sir Robert. \"Discipline\ngood--no crime?\"\n\n\"The discipline is excellent, sir,\" replied Hamilton, heartily, \"and we\nhaven't had any serious crime for years.\"\n\nSir Robert Sanleigh fixed his _pince-nez_ upon his nose and looked round\nthe parade ground. A dozen Houssas in two ranks stood at attention in\nthe centre.\n\n\"Where are the rest of your men?\" asked the Administrator.\n\n\"In gaol, sir.\" It was Bones who answered the question.\n\nHamilton gasped.\n\n\"In gaol--I'm sorry--but I knew nothing for this. I've just arrived from\nthe interior, your Excellency.\"\n\nThey walked across to the little party.\n\n\"Where is Sergeant Abiboo?\" asked Hamilton suddenly.\n\n\"In gaol, sir,\" said Bones, promptly, \"sentenced to death--scratchin'\nhis leg on parade after bein' warned repeatedly by me to give up the\ndisgusting habit.\"\n\n\"Where is Corporal Ahmet, Bones?\" asked the frantic Hamilton.\n\n\"In gaol, sir,\" said Bones. \"I gave him twenty years for talkin' in the\nranks an' cheekin' me when I told him to shut up. There's a whole lot of\nthem, sir,\" he went on casually. \"I sentenced two chaps to death for\nfightin' in the lines, an' gave another feller ten years for----\"\n\n\"I think that will do,\" said Sir Robert, tactfully. \"A most excellent\ninspection, Captain Hamilton--now, I think, I'll get back to my ship.\"\n\nHe took Hamilton aside on the beach.\n\n\"What did you call that young man?\" he asked.\n\n\"Bones, your Excellency,\" said Hamilton miserably.\n\n\"I should call him Blood and Bones,\" smiled His Excellency, as he shook\nhands.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What's the good of bullyin' me, dear old chap?\" asked Bones\nindignantly. \"If I let a chap off, I'm kicked, an' if I punish him I'm\nkicked--it's enough to make a feller give up bein' judicial----\"\n\n\"Bones, you're a goop,\" said Hamilton, in despair.\n\n\"A goop, sir?--if you'd be kind enough to explain----?\"\n\n\"There's an ass,\" said Hamilton, ticking off one finger; \"and there's a\nsilly ass,\" he ticked off the second; \"and there's a silly ass who is\nsuch a silly ass that he doesn't know what a silly ass he is: we call\nhim a goop.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Bones, without resentment, \"and which is the\ngoop, you or----?\"\n\nHamilton dropped his hand on his revolver butt, and for a moment there\nwas murder in his eyes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE LOST N'BOSINI\n\n\n\"M'ilitani, there is a bad palaver in the N'bosini country,\" said the\ngossip-chief of the Lesser Isisi, and wagged his head impressively.\n\nHamilton of the Houssas rose up from his camp chair and stretched\nhimself to his full six feet. His laughing eyes--terribly blue they\nlooked in the mahogany setting of his lean face--quizzed the chief, and\nhis clean-shaven lips twitched ever so slightly.\n\nChief Idigi looked at him curiously. Idigi was squat and fat, but wise.\nNone the less he gossiped, for, as they say on the river, \"Even the wise\n_oochiri_ is a chatterer.\"\n\n\"O, laughing Lord,\" said Idigi, almost humble in his awe--for blue eyes\nin a brown face are a great sign of devilry, \"this is no smiling\npalaver, for they say----\"\n\n\"Idigi,\" interrupted Hamilton, \"I smile when you speak of the N'bosini,\nbecause there is no such land. Even Sandi, who has wisdom greater than\n_ju-ju_, he says that there is no N'bosini, but that it is the foolish\ntalk of men who cannot see whence come their troubles and must find a\nland and a people and a king out of their mad heads. Go back to your\nvillage, Idigi, telling all men that I sit here for a spell in the place\nof my lord Sandi, and if there be, not one king of N'bosini, but a\nscore, and if he lead, not one army, but three and three and three, I\nwill meet him with my soldiers and he shall go the way of the bad king.\"\n\nIdigi, unconvinced, shaking his head, said a doubtful \"_Wa!_\" and would\ncontinue upon his agreeable subject--for he was a lover of ghosts.\n\n\"Now,\" said he, impressively, \"it is said that on the night before the\nmoon came, there was seen, on the edge of the lake-forest, ten warriors\nof the N'bosini, with spears of fire and arrows tipped with stars,\nalso----\"\n\n\"Go to the devil!\" said Hamilton, cheerfully. \"The palaver is finished.\"\n\nLater, he watched Idigi--so humble a man that he never travelled with\nmore than four paddlers--winding his slow way up stream--and Hamilton\nwas not laughing.\n\nHe went back to his canvas chair before the Residency, and sat for half\nan hour, alternately pinching and rubbing his bare arms--he was in his\nshirt sleeves--in a reverie which was not pleasant.\n\nHere Lieutenant Augustus Tibbetts, returning from an afternoon's\nfishing, with a couple of weird-looking fish as his sole catch, found\nhim and would have gone on with a little salute.\n\n\"Bones!\" called Hamilton, softly.\n\nBones swung round. \"Sir!\" he said stiffly.\n\n\"Come off your horse, Bones,\" coaxed Hamilton.\n\n\"Not me,\" replied Bones; \"I've finished with you, dear old fellow; as an\nofficer an' a gentleman you've treated me rottenly--you have, indeed.\nGive me an order--I'll obey it. Tell me to lead a forlorn hope or go to\nbed at ten--I'll carry out instructions accordin' to military law, but\noutside of duty you're a jolly old rotter. I'm hurt, Ham, doocidly hurt.\nI think----\"\n\n\"Oh shut up and sit down!\" interrupted his chief, irritably. \"You jaw\nand jaw till my head aches.\"\n\nReluctantly Lieutenant Tibbetts walked back, depositing his catch with\nthe greatest care on the ground.\n\n\"What on earth have you got there?\" asked Hamilton, curiously.\n\n\"I don't know whether it's cod or turbot,\" said the cautious Bones, \"but\nI'll have 'em cooked and find out.\"\n\nHamilton grinned. \"To be exact, they're catfish, and poisonous,\" he\nsaid, and whistled his orderly. \"Oh, Ahmet,\" he said in Arabic, \"take\nthese fish and throw them away.\"\n\nBones fixed his monocle, and his eyes followed his catch till they were\nout of sight.\n\n\"Of course, sir,\" he said with resignation, \"if you like to commandeer\nmy fish it's not for me to question you.\"\n\n\"I'm a little worried, Bones,\" began Hamilton.\n\n\"A conscience, sir,\" said Bones, smugly, \"is a pretty rotten thing for a\nfeller to have. I remember years ago----\"\n\n\"There's a little unrest up there\"--Hamilton waved his hand towards the\ndark green forest, sombre in the shadows of the evening--\"a palaver I\ndon't quite get the hang of. If I could only trust you, Bones!\"\n\nLieutenant Tibbetts rose. He readjusted his monocle and stiffened\nhimself to attention--a heroic pose which invariably accompanied his\nprotests. But Hamilton gave him no opportunity.\n\n\"Anyway, I have to trust you, Bones,\" he said, \"whether I like it or\nnot. You get ready to clear out. Take twenty men and patrol the river\nbetween the Isisi and the Akasava.\"\n\nIn as few words as possible he explained the legend of the N'bosini. \"Of\ncourse, there is no such place,\" he said; \"it is a mythical land like\nthe lost Atlantis--the home of the mysterious and marvellous tribes,\npopulated by giants and filled with all the beautiful products of the\nworld.\"\n\n\"I know, sir,\" said Bones, nodding his head. \"It is like one of those\nbuilding estate advertisements you read in the American papers:\nYoung-man-go-west-an'-buy-Dudville Corner Blocks----\"\n\n\"You have a horrible mind,\" said Hamilton. \"However, get ready. I will\nhave steam in the _Zaire_ against your departure.\"\n\n\"There is one thing I should like to ask you about,\" said Bones,\nstanding hesitatingly first on one leg and then on the other. \"I think\nI have told you before that I have tickets in a Continental sweepstake.\nI should be awfully obliged----\"\n\n\"Go away!\" snarled Hamilton.\n\nBones went cheerfully enough.\n\nHe loved the life on the _Zaire_, the comfort of Sanders' cabin, the\nelectric reading lamp and the fine sense of authority. He would stand\nupon the bridge for hours, with folded arms and impassive face, staring\nahead as the oily waters moved slowly under the bow of the\nstern-wheeler. Now and again he would turn to give a fierce order to the\nsteersman or to the patient Yoka, the squat black _Krooman_ who knew\nevery inch of the river, and who stood all the time, his hand upon the\nlever of the telegraph ready to \"slow\" at the first sign of a new\nsand-bank.\n\nFor, in parts, the river was less than two or three feet deep and the\nbed was constantly changing. The sounding boys, who stood on the bow of\nthe steamer, whirling their long canes and singing the depth\nmonotonously, would shout a warning cry, but long before their lips had\nframed a caution, Yoka would have pulled the telegraph over to \"stop.\"\nHis eyes would have detected the tiny ripple on the waters ahead which\ndenoted a new \"bank.\"\n\nTo Bones, the river was a deep, clear stream. He had no idea as to the\ndepth and never troubled to inquire. These short, stern orders of his\nthat he barked to left and right from time to time, nobody took the\nslightest notice of, and Bones would have been considerably embarrassed\nif they had. Observing that the steamer was tacking from shore to shore,\na proceeding which, to Bones' orderly mind, seemed inconsistent with the\ndignity of the Government boat, he asked the reason.\n\n\"Lord,\" said the steersman, one Ebibi, \"there are many banks hereabout,\nlarge sands, which silt up in a night, therefore we must make a passage\nfor the _puc-a-puc_, by going from shore to shore.\"\n\n\"You're a silly ass,\" said Bones, \"and let it go at that.\"\n\nYet, for all his irresponsibility, for all his wild and unknowledgeable\nconspectus of the land and its people, there was instilled in the heart\nof Lieutenant Tibbetts something of the spirit of dark romance and\nadventure-loving, which association with the Coast alone can bring.\n\nIn the big house at Dorking where he had spent his childhood, the\nten-acre estate, where his father had lorded (himself a one-time\nCommissioner), he had watered the seed of desire which heredity had\nirradicably sown in his bosom; a desire not to be shaped by words, or\nconfirmed in phrase, but best described as the discovery-lust, which\nsend men into dark, unknown places of the world to joyously sacrifice\nlife and health that their names might be associated with some scrap of\nsure fact for the better guidance of unborn generations.\n\nBones was a dreamer of dreams.\n\nOn the bridge of the _Zaire_ he was a Nelson taking the _Victory_ into\naction, a Stanley, a Columbus, a Sir Garnet Wolseley forcing the\npassages of the Nile.\n\nSmall wonder that he turned from time to time to the steersman with a\nsharp \"Put her to starboard,\" or \"Port your helm a little.\"\n\nLess wonder that the wholly uncomprehending steersman went on with his\nwork as though Bones had no separate or tangible existence.\n\nOn the fourth evening after leaving headquarters, Bones summoned to his\ncabin Mahomet Ali, the sergeant in charge of his soldiers.\n\n\"O, Mahomet,\" said he, \"tell me of this N'bosini of which men speak, and\nin which all native people believe, for my lord M'ilitani has said that\nthere is no such place and that it is the dream of mad people.\"\n\n\"Master, that I also believe,\" said Mahomet Ali; \"these people of the\nriver are barbarians, having no God and being foredoomed for all time to\nhell, and it is my belief that his idea of N'bosini is no more than the\nParadise of the faithful, of which the barbarians have heard and\nconverted in their wild way.\"\n\n\"Tell me, who talks of N'bosini,\" said Bones, crossing his legs and\nleaning back in his chair, his hands behind his head; \"for, remember\nthat I am a stranger amongst you, Mahomet Ali, coming from a far land\nand having seen such marvels as----\"\n\nHe paused, seeking the Arabic for \"gramaphone\" and \"motor-'bus,\" then he\nwent on wisely: \"Such marvels as you cannot imagine.\"\n\n\"This I know of N'bosini,\" said the sergeant, \"that all men along this\nriver believe in it; all save Bosambo of the Ochori who, as is well\nknown, believes in nothing, since he is a follower of the Prophet and\nthe one God.\"\n\nMahomet Ali salaamed devoutly.\n\n\"And men say that this land lies at the back of the N'gombi country; and\nothers that it lies near the territories of the old King; and some\nothers who say that it is a far journey beyond the French's territory,\nfarther than man can walk, that its people have wings upon their\nshoulders and can fly, and that their eyes are so fierce that trees burn\nwhen they look upon them. This only we know, lord, we, of your soldiers,\nwho have followed Sandi through all his high adventures, that when men\ntalk of N'bosini, there is trouble, for they are seeking something to\nexcuse their own wickedness.\"\n\nAll night long, as Bones turned from side to side in his hot cabin,\nlistening to the ineffectual buzzings of the flies that sought,\nunsuccessfully, to reach the interior of the cabin through a fine meshed\nscreen, the problem of N'bosini revolved in his mind.\n\nWas it likely, thought Bones, cunningly, that men should invent a\ncountry, even erring men, seeking an excuse? Did not all previous\nexperience go to the support of the theory that N'bosini had some\nexistence? In other words that, planted in the secret heart of some\nforest in the territory, barred from communication with the world by\nswift rivers of the high tangle of forests, there was, in being, a\nsecret tribe of which only rumours had been heard--a tribe of white men,\nperhaps!\n\nBones had read of such things in books; he knew his \"Solomon's Mines\"\nand was well acquainted with his \"Allan Quatermain.\" Who knows but that\nthrough the forest was a secret path held, perchance, by armoured\nwarriors, which led to the mountains at the edge of the Old King's\nterritory, where in the folds of the inaccessible hills, there might be\na city of stone, peopled and governed by stern white-bearded men, and\nstreets filled with beautiful maidens garbed in the style of ancient\nGreece!\n\n\"It is all dam' nonsense of course,\" said Bones to himself, though\nfeebly; \"but, after all there may be something in this. There's no smoke\nwithout fire.\"\n\nThe idea took hold of him and gripped him most powerfully. He took\nSanders' priceless maps and carefully triangulated them, consulting\nevery other written authority on the ship. He stopped at villages and\nheld palavers on this question of N'bosini and acquired a whole mass of\nconflicting information.\n\nIf you smile at Bones, you smile at the glorious spirit of enterprise\nwhich has created Empire. Out of such dreams as ran criss-cross through\nthe mind of Lieutenant Tibbetts there have arisen nationalities undreamt\nof and Empires C\u00e6sar never knew.\n\nNow one thing is certain, that Bones, in pursuing his inquiries about\nN'bosini, was really doing a most useful piece of work.\n\nThe palavers he called had a deeper significance to the men who attended\nthem than purely geographical inquiries. Thus, the folk of the Isisi\nplanning a little raid upon certain Akasava fishermen, who had\nestablished themselves unlawfully upon the Isisi river-line, put away\ntheir spears and folded their hands when N'bosini was mentioned, because\nBones was unconsciously probing their excuse before they advanced it.\n\nIdigi, himself, who, in his caution, had prepared Hamilton for some\nslight difference of opinion between his own tribe and the N'gombi of\nthe interior, read into the earnest inquiries of Lieutenant Tibbetts,\nsomething more than a patient spirit of research.\n\nAll that Hamilton had set his subordinate to accomplish Bones was doing,\nthough none was more in ignorance of the fact than himself, and, since\nall men owed a grudge to the Ochori, palavers, which had as their object\nan investigation into the origin of the N'bosini legend, invariably\nended in the suggestion rather than the statement that the only\nauthority upon this mysterious land, and the still more mysterious tribe\nwho inhabited it, was Bosambo of the Ochori. Thus, subtly, was Bosambo\nsaddled with all responsibility in the matter.\n\nHamilton's parting injunction to Bones had been:\n\n\"Be immensely civil to Bosambo, because he is rather sore with you and\nhe is a very useful man.\"\n\nRegarding him, as he did, as the final authority upon the N'bosini,\nBones made elaborate preparations to carry out his chief's commands. He\ncame round the river bend to the Ochori city, with flags fluttering at\nhis white mast, with his soldiers drawn up on deck, with his buglers\ntootling, and his siren sounding, and Bosambo, ever ready to jump to the\nconclusion that he was being honoured for his own sake, found that this\ntime, at least, he had made no mistake and rose to the occasion.\n\nIn an emerald-green robe with twelve sox suspenders strapped about his\nlegs and dangling tags a-glitter--he had bought these on his visit to\nthe Coast--with an umbrella of state and six men carrying a canopy over\nhis august person, he came down to the beach to greet the\nrepresentatives of the Government.\n\n\"Lord,\" said Bosambo humbly, \"it gives me great pride that your lordship\nshould bring his beautiful presence to my country. All this month I have\nsat in my hut, wondering why you came not to the Ochori, and I have not\neaten food for many days because of my sorrow and my fear that you would\nnot come to us.\"\n\nBones walked under the canopy to the chief's hut. A superior palaver\noccupied the afternoon on the question of taxation. Here Bones was on\nsafe ground. Having no power to remit taxes, but having most explicit\ninstructions from his chief, which admitted of no compromise, it was an\neasy matter for Bones to shake his head and say in English:\n\n\"Nothin' doing\"; a phrase which, afterwards, passed into the vocabulary\nof the Ochori as the equivalent of denial of privilege.\n\nIt was on the second day that Bones broached the question of the\nN'bosini. Bosambo had it on the tip of his tongue to deny all knowledge\nof this tribe, was even preparing to call down destruction upon the\nheads of the barbarians who gave credence to the story. Then he asked\ncuriously:\n\n\"Lord, why do you speak of the land or desire knowledge upon it?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Bones, firmly, \"it is in mind, Bosambo, that somewhere\nin this country, dwell such a people, and since all men agree that you\nare wise, I have come to you to seek it.\"\n\n\"_O ko_,\" said Bosambo, under his breath.\n\nHe fixed his eyes upon Bones, licked his lips a little, twiddled his\nfingers a great deal, and began:\n\n\"Lord, it is written in a certain _Suru_ that wisdom comest from the\nEast, and that knowledge from the West, that courage comes from the\nNorth, and sin from the South.\"\n\n\"Steady the Buffs, Bosambo!\" murmured Bones, reprovingly, \"I come from\nthe South.\"\n\nHe spoke in English, and Bosambo, resisting the temptation to retort in\nan alien tongue, and realizing perhaps that he would need all the\nstrength of his more extensive vocabulary to convince his hearer,\ncontinued in Bomongo:\n\n\"Now I tell you,\" he went on solemnly, \"if Sandi had come, Sandi, who\nloves me better than his brother, and who knew my father and lived with\nhim for many years, and if Sandi spoke to me, saying 'Tell me, O\nBosambo, where is N'bosini?' I answer 'Lord, there are things which are\nwritten and which I know cannot be told, not even to you whom I love so\ndearly.'\" He paused.\n\nBones was impressed. He stared, wide-eyed, at the chief, tilted his\nhelmet back a little from his damp brow, folded his hands on his knees\nand opened his mouth a little.\n\n\"But it is you, O my lord,\" said Bosambo, extravagantly, \"who asks this\nquestion. You, who have suddenly come amongst us and who are brighter to\nus than the moon and dearer to us than the land which grows corn;\ntherefore must I speak to you that which is in my heart. If I lie,\nstrike me down at your feet, for I am ready to die.\"\n\nHe paused again, throwing out his arms invitingly, but Bones said\nnothing.\n\n\"Now this I tell you,\" Bosambo shook his finger impressively, \"that the\nN'bosini lives.\"\n\n\"Where?\" asked Bones, quickly.\n\nAlready he saw himself lecturing before a crowded audience at the Royal\nGeographical Society, his name in the papers, perhaps a Tibbett River or\na Francis Augustus Mountain added to the sum of geographical knowledge.\n\n\"It is in a certain place,\" said Bosambo, solemnly, \"which only I know,\nand I have sworn a solemn oath by many sacred things which I dare not\nbreak, by letting of blood and by rubbing in of salt, that I will not\ndivulge the secret.\"\n\n\"O, tell me, Bosambo,\" demanded Bones, leaning forward and speaking\nrapidly, \"what manner of people are they who live in the city of\nN'bosini?\"\n\n\"They are men and women,\" said Bosambo after a pause.\n\n\"White or black?\" asked Bones, eagerly.\n\nBosambo thought a little.\n\n\"White,\" he said soberly, and was immensely pleased at the impression he\ncreated.\n\n\"I thought so,\" said Bones, excitedly, and jumped up, his eyes wider\nthan ever, his hands trembling as he pulled his note-book from his\nbreast pocket.\n\n\"I will make a book[3] of this, Bosambo,\" he said, almost incoherently.\n\"You shall speak slowly, telling me all things, for I must write in\nEnglish.\"\n\n[Footnote 3: \"Book\" means any written thing. A \"Note\" is a book.]\n\nHe produced his pencil, squatted again, open book upon his knee, and\nlooked up at Bosambo to commence.\n\n\"Lord, I cannot do this,\" said Bosambo, his face heavy with gloom, \"for\nhave I not told your lordship that I have sworn such oath? Moreover,\" he\nsaid carelessly, \"we who know the secret, have each hidden a large bag\nof silver in the ground, all in one place, and we have sworn that he who\ntells the secret shall lose his share. Now, by the Prophet,\n'Eye-of-the-Moon' (this was one of the names which Bones had earned,\nfor which his monocle was responsible), I cannot do this thing.\"\n\n\"How large was this bag, Bosambo?\" asked Bones, nibbling the end of his\npencil.\n\n\"Lord, it was so large,\" said Bosambo.\n\nHe moved his hands outward slowly, keeping his eyes fixed upon\nLieutenant Tibbetts till he read in them a hint of pain and dismay. Then\nhe stopped.\n\n\"So large,\" he said, choosing the dimensions his hands had indicated\nbefore Bones showed signs of alarm. \"Lord, in the bag was silver worth a\nhundred English pounds.\"\n\nBones, continuing his meal of cedar-wood, thought the matter out.\n\nIt was worth it.\n\n\"Is it a large city?\" he asked suddenly.\n\n\"Larger than the whole of the Ochori,\" answered Bosambo impressively.\n\n\"And tell me this, Bosambo, what manner of houses are these which stand\nin the city of the N'bosini?\"\n\n\"Larger than kings' huts,\" said Bosambo.\n\n\"Of stone?\"\n\n\"Lord, of rock, so that they are like mountains,\" replied Bosambo.\n\nBones shut his book and got up.\n\n\"This day I go back to M'ilitani, carrying word of the N'bosini,\" said\nhe, and Bosambo's jaw dropped, though Bones did not notice the fact.\n\n\"Presently I will return, bringing with me silver of the value of a\nhundred English pounds, and you shall lead us to this strange city.\"\n\n\"Lord, it is a far way,\" faltered Bosambo, \"across many swamps and over\nhigh mountains; also there is much sickness and death, wild beasts in\nthe forests and snakes in the trees and terrible storms of rain.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, I will go,\" said Bones, in high spirits, \"I, and you\nalso.\"\n\n\"Master,\" said the agitated Bosambo, \"say no word of this to M'ilitani;\nif you do, be sure that my enemies will discover it and I shall be\nkilled.\"\n\nBones hesitated and Bosambo pushed his advantage.\n\n\"Rather, lord,\" said he, \"give me all the silver you have and let me go\nalone, carrying a message to the mighty chief of the N'bosini. Presently\nI will return, bringing with me strange news, such as no white lord, not\neven Sandi, has received or heard, and cunning weapons which only\nN'bosini use and strange magics. Also will I bring you stories of their\nriver, but I will go alone, though I die, for what am I that I should\ndeny myself from the service of your lordship?\"\n\nIt happened that Bones had some twenty pounds on the _Zaire_, and\nBosambo condescended to come aboard to accept, with outstretched hands,\nthis earnest of his master's faith.\n\n\"Lord,\" said he, solemnly, as he took a farewell of his benefactor,\n\"though I lose a great bag of silver because I have betrayed certain\nmen, yet I know that, upon a day to come, you will pay me all that I\ndesire. Go in peace.\"\n\nIt was a hilarious, joyous, industrious Bones who went down the river to\nheadquarters, occupying his time in writing diligently upon large sheets\nof foolscap in his no less large unformed handwriting, setting forth all\nthat Bosambo had told him, and all the conclusions he might infer from\nthe confidence of the Ochori king.\n\nHe was bursting with his news. At first, he had to satisfy his chief\nthat he had carried out his orders.\n\nFortunately, Hamilton needed little convincing; his own spies had told\nhim of the quietening down of certain truculent sections of his unruly\ncommunity and he was prepared to give his subordinate all the credit\nthat was due to him.\n\nIt was after dinner and the inevitable rice pudding had been removed and\nthe pipes were puffing bluely in the big room of the Residency, when\nBones unburdened himself.\n\n\"Sir,\" he began, \"you think I am an ass.\"\n\n\"I was not thinking so at this particular moment,\" said Hamilton; \"but,\nas a general consensus of my opinion concerning you, I have no fault to\nfind with it.\"\n\n\"You think poor old Bones is a goop,\" said Lieutenant Tibbetts with a\npitying smile, \"and yet the name of poor old Bones is going down to\nposterity, sir.\"\n\n\"That is posterity's look-out,\" said Hamilton, offensively; but Bones\nignored the rudeness.\n\n\"You also imagine that there is no such land as the N'bosini, I think?\"\n\nBones put the question with a certain insolent assurance which was very\nirritating.\n\n\"I not only think, but I know,\" replied Hamilton.\n\nBones laughed, a sardonic, knowing laugh.\n\n\"We shall see,\" he said, mysteriously; \"I hope, in the course of a few\nweeks, to place a document in your possession that will not only\nsurprise, but which, I believe, knowing that beneath a somewhat uncouth\nmanner lies a kindly heart, will also please you.\"\n\n\"Are you chucking up the army?\" asked Hamilton with interest.\n\n\"I have no more to say, sir,\" said Bones.\n\nHe got up, took his helmet from a peg on the wall, saluted and walked\nstiffly from the Residency and was swallowed up in the darkness of the\nparade ground.\n\nA quarter of an hour later, there came a tap upon his door and Mahomet\nAli, his sergeant, entered.\n\n\"Ah, Mah'met,\" said Hamilton, looking up with a smile, \"all things were\nquiet on the river my lord Tibbetts tells me.\"\n\n\"Lord, everything was proper,\" said the sergeant, \"and all people came\nto palaver humbly.\"\n\n\"What seek you now?\" asked Hamilton.\n\n\"Lord,\" said Mahomet, \"Bosambo of the Ochori is, as you know, of my\nfaith, and by certain oaths we are as blood brothers. This happened\nafter a battle in the year of Drought when Bosambo saved my life.\"\n\n\"All this I know,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"Now, lord,\" said Mahomet Ali, \"I bring you this.\"\n\nHe took from the inside of his uniform jacket a little canvas bag,\nopened it slowly and emptied its golden contents upon the table. There\nwas a small shining heap of sovereigns and a twisted note; this latter\nhe placed in Hamilton's hand and the Houssa captain unfolded it. It was\na letter in Arabic in Bosambo's characteristic and angular handwriting.\n\n     \"From Bosambo, the servant of the Prophet, of the upper river in\n     the city of the Ochori, to M'ilitani, his master. Peace on your\n     house.\n\n     \"In the name of God I send you this news. My lord with the\n     moon-eye, making inquiries about the N'bosini, came to the Ochori\n     and I told him much that he wrote down in a book. Now, I tell you,\n     M'ilitani, that I am not to blame, because my lord with the\n     moon-eye wrote down these things. Also he gave me twenty English\n     pounds because I told him certain stories and this I send to you,\n     that you shall put it in with my other treasures, making a mark in\n     your book that this twenty pounds is the money of Bosambo of the\n     Ochori, and that you will send me a book, saying that this money\n     has come to you and is safely in your hands. Peace and felicity\n     upon your house.\n\n     \"Written in my city of Ochori and given to my brother, Mahomet Ali,\n     who shall carry it to M'ilitani at the mouth of the river.\"\n\n\"Poor old Bones!\" said Hamilton, as he slowly counted the money. \"Poor\nold Bones!\" he repeated.\n\nHe took an account book from his desk and opened it at a page marked\n\"Bosambo.\" His entry was significant.\n\nTo a long list of credits which ran:\n\n     Received \u00a330.  (Sale of Rubber.)\n\n     Received \u00a325.  (Sale of Gum.)\n\n     Received \u00a3130. (Sale of Ivory.)\n\nhe added:\n\n     Received \u00a320.  (Author's Fees.)\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE FETISH STICK\n\n\nN'gori the Chief had a son who limped and lived. This was a marvellous\nthing in a land where cripples are severely discouraged and malformity\nis a sure passport for heaven.\n\nThe truth is that M'fosa was born in a fishing village at a period of\ntime when all the energies of the Akasava were devoted to checking and\ndefeating the predatory raidings of the N'gombi, under that warlike\nchief G'osimalino, who also kept other nations on the defensive, and\nheld the river basin, from the White River, by the old king's territory,\nto as far south as the islands of the Lesser Isisi.\n\nWhen M'fosa was three months old, Sanders had come with a force of\nsoldiers, had hanged G'osimalino to a high tree, had burnt his villages\nand destroyed his crops and driven the remnants of his one-time\ninvincible army to the little known recesses of the Itusi Forest.\n\nThose were the days of the Cakitas or government chiefs, and it was\nunder the beneficent sway of one of these that M'fosa grew to manhood,\nthough many attempts were made to lure him to unfrequented waterways\nand blind crocodile creeks where a lame man might be lost, and no one be\nany the wiser.\n\nChief of the eugenists was Kobolo, the boy's uncle, and N'gori's own\nbrother. This dissatisfied man, with several of M'fosa's cousins, once\npartially succeeded in kidnapping the lame boy, and they were on their\nway to certain middle islands in the broads of the river to accomplish\ntheir scheme--which was to put out the eyes of M'fosa and leave him to\ndie--when Sanders had happened along.\n\nHe it was who set all the men of M'fosa's village to cut down a high\npine tree--at an infernal distance from the village, and had men working\nfor a week, trimming and planing that pine; and another week they spent\ncarrying the long stem through the forest (Sanders had devilishly chosen\nhis tree in the most inaccessible part of the woods), and yet another\nweek digging large holes and erecting it.\n\nFor he was a difficult man to please. Broad backs ran sweat to pull and\npush and hoist that great flagstaff (as it appeared with its strong\npulley and smooth sides) to its place. And no sooner was it up than my\nlord Sandi had changed his mind and must have it in another place.\nSanders would come back at intervals to see how the work was\nprogressing. At last it was fixed, that monstrous pole, and the men of\nthe village sighed thankfully.\n\n\"Lord, tell me,\" N'gori had asked, \"why you put this great stick in the\nground?\"\n\n\"This,\" said Sanders, \"is for him who injures M'fosa your son; upon this\nwill I hang him. And if there be more men than one who take to the work\nof slaughter, behold! I will have yet another tree cut and hauled, and\nput in a place and upon that will I hang the other man. All men shall\nknow this sign, the high stick as my fetish; and it shall watch the evil\nhearts and carry me all thoughts, good and evil. And then I tell you,\nthat such is its magic, that if needs be, it shall draw me from the end\nof the world to punish wrong.\"\n\nThis is the story of the fetish stick of the Akasava and of how it came\nto be in its place.\n\nNone did hurt to M'fosa, and he grew to be a man, and as he grew and his\nfather became first counsellor, then petty chief, and, at last,\nparamount chief of the nation, M'fosa developed in hauteur and\nbitterness, for this high pole rainwashed, and sun-burnt, was a\nreminder, not of the strong hand that had been stretched out to save\nhim, but of his own infirmity.\n\nAnd he came to hate it, and by some curious perversion to hate the man\nwho had set it up.\n\nMost curious of all to certain minds, he was the first of those who\ncondemned, and secretly slew, the unfortunates, who either came into the\nworld hampered by disfigurement, or who, by accident, were unfitted for\nthe great battle.\n\nHe it was who drowned Kibusi the woodman, who lost three fingers by the\nslipping of the axe; he was the leader of the young men who fell upon\nthe boy Sandilo-M'goma, who was crippled by fire; and though the fetish\nstood a menace to all, reading thoughts and clothed with authority, yet\nM'fosa defied spirits and went about his work reckless of consequence.\n\nWhen Sanders had gone home, and it seemed that law had ceased to be,\nN'gori (as I have shown) became of a sudden a bold and fearless man,\nfurbished up his ancient grievances and might have brought trouble to\nthe land, but for a watchful Bosambo.\n\nThis is certain, however, that N'gori himself was a good-enough man at\nheart, and if there was evil in his actions be sure that behind him\nprompting, whispering, subtly threatening him, was his malignant son, a\nsinister figure with one eye half closed, and a figure that went limping\nthrough the city with a twisted smile.\n\nAn envoy came to the Ochori country bearing green branches of the Isisi\npalm, which signifies peace, and at the head of the mission--for mission\nit was--came M'fosa.\n\n\"Lord Bosambo,\" said the man who limped, \"N'gori the chief, my father,\nhas sent me, for he desires your friendship and help; also your loving\ncountenance at his great feast.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" said Bosambo, drily, \"what king's feast is this?\"\n\n\"Lord,\" rejoined the other, \"it is no king's feast, but a great dance of\nrejoicing, for our crops are very plentiful, and our goats have\nmultiplied more than a man can count; therefore my father said: Go you\nto Bosambo of the Ochori, he who was once my enemy and now indeed my\nfriend. And say to him 'Come into my city, that I may honour you.'\"\n\nBosambo thought.\n\n\"How can your lord and father feast so many as I would bring?\" he asked\nthoughtfully, as he sat, chin on palm, pondering the invitation, \"for I\nhave a thousand spearmen, all young men and fond of food.\"\n\nM'fosa's face fell.\n\n\"Yet, Lord Bosambo,\" said he, \"if you come without your spearmen, but\nwith your counsellors only----\"\n\nBosambo looked at the limper, through half-closed eyes. \"I carry spears\nto a Dance of Rejoicing,\" he said significantly, \"else I would not Dance\nor Rejoice.\"\n\nM'fosa showed his teeth, and his eyes were filled with hateful fires. He\nleft the Ochori with bad grace, and was lucky to leave it at all, for\ncertain men of the country, whom he had put to torture (having captured\nthem fishing in unauthorized waters), would have rushed him but for\nBosambo's presence.\n\nHis other invitation was more successful. Hamilton of the Houssas was at\nthe Isisi city when the deputation called upon him.\n\n\"Here's a chance for you, Bones,\" he said.\n\nLieutenant Tibbetts had spent a vain day, fishing in the river with a\nrod and line, and was sprawling under a deck-chair under the awning of\nthe bridge.\n\n\"Would you like to be the guest of honour at N'gori's little\nthanksgiving service?\"\n\nBones sat up.\n\n\"Shall I have to make a speech?\" he asked cautiously.\n\n\"You may have to respond for the ladies,\" said Hamilton. \"No, my dear\nchap, all you will have to do will be to sit round and look clever.\"\n\nBones thought awhile.\n\n\"I'll bet you're putting me on to a rotten job,\" he accused, \"but I'll\ngo.\"\n\n\"I wish you would,\" said Hamilton, seriously. \"I can't get the hang of\nM'fosa's mind, ever since you treated him with such leniency.\"\n\n\"If you're goin' to dig up the grisly past, dear old sir,\" said a\nreproachful Bones, \"if you insist recalling events which I hoped, sir,\nwere hidden in oblivion, I'm going to bed.\"\n\nHe got up, this lank youth, fixed his eyeglass firmly and glared at his\nsuperior.\n\n\"Sit down and shut up,\" said Hamilton, testily; \"I'm not blaming you.\nAnd I'm not blaming N'gori. It's that son of his--listen to this.\"\n\nHe beckoned the three men who had come down from the Akasava as bearers\nof the invitation.\n\n\"Say again what your master desires,\" he said.\n\n\"Thus speaks N'gori, and I talk with his voice,\" said the spokesman,\n\"that you shall cut down the devil-stick which Sandi planted in our\nmidst, for it brings shame to us, and also to M'fosa the son of our\nmaster.\"\n\n\"How may I do this?\" asked Hamilton, \"I, who am but the servant of\nSandi? For I remember well that he put the stick there to make a great\nmagic.\"\n\n\"Now the magic is made,\" said the sullen headman; \"for none of our\npeople have died the death since Sandi set it up.\"\n\n\"And dashed lucky you've been,\" murmured Bones.\n\n\"Go back to your master and tell him this,\" said Hamilton. \"Thus says\nM'ilitani, my lord Tibbetti will come on your feast day and you shall\nhonour him; as for the stick, it stands till Sandi says it shall not\nstand. The palaver is finished.\"\n\nHe paced up and down the deck when the men had gone, his hands behind\nhim, his brows knit in worry.\n\n\"Four times have I been asked to cut down Sanders' pole,\" he mused\naloud. \"I wonder what the idea is?\"\n\n\"The idea?\" said Bones, \"the idea, my dear old silly old fellow, isn't\nit as plain as your dashed old nose? They don't want it!\"\n\nHamilton looked down at him.\n\n\"What a brain you must have, Bones!\" he said admiringly. \"I often wonder\nyou don't employ it.\"\n\n\nII\n\nBy the Blue Pool in the forest there is a famous tree gifted with\ncertain properties. It is known in the vernacular of the land, and I\ntranslate it literally, \"The-tree-that-has-no-echo-and-eats-up-sound.\"\nMen believe that all that is uttered beneath its twisted branches may be\nremembered, but not repeated, and if one shouts in its deadening shade,\neven they who stand no farther than a stride from its furthermost\nstretch of branch or leaf, will hear nothing.\n\nTherefore is the Silent Tree much in favour for secret palaver, such as\nN'gori and his limping son attended, and such as the Lesser Isisi came\nto fearfully.\n\nN'gori, who might be expected to take a very leading part in the\ndiscussion which followed the meeting, was, in fact, the most timorous\nof those who squatted in the shadow of the huge cedar.\n\nFull of reservations, cautions, doubts and counsels of discretion was\nN'gori till his son turned on him, grinning as his wont when in his\nleast pleasant mood.\n\n\"O, my father,\" said he softly, \"they say on the river that men who die\nswiftly say no more than 'wait' with their last breath; now I tell you\nthat all my young men who plot secretly with me, are for chopping\nyou--but because I am like a god to them, they spare you.\"\n\n\"My son,\" said N'gori uneasily, \"this is a very high palaver, for many\nchiefs have risen and struck at the Government, and always Sandi has\ncome with his soldiers, and there have been backs that have been sore\nfor the space of a moon, and necks that have been sore for this time,\"\nhe snapped finger, \"and then have been sore no more.\"\n\n\"Sandi has gone,\" said M'fosa.\n\n\"Yet his fetish stands,\" insisted the old man; \"all day and all night\nhis dreadful spirit watches us; for this we have all seen that the very\nlightnings of M'shimba M'shamba run up that stick and do it no harm.\nAlso M'ilitani and Moon-in-the-Eye----\"\n\n\"They are fools,\" a counsellor broke in.\n\n\"Lord M'ilitani is no fool, this I know,\" interrupted a fourth.\n\n\"Tibbetti comes--and brings no soldiers. Now I tell you my mind that\nSandi's fetish is dead--as Sandi has passed from us, and this is the\nsign I desire--I and my young men. We shall make a killing palaver in\nthe face of the killing stick, and if Sandi lives and has not lied to\nus, he shall come from the end of the world as he said.\"\n\nHe rose up from the ground. There was no doubt now who ruled the\nAkasava.\n\n\"The palaver is finished,\" he said, and led the way back to the city,\nhis father meekly following in the rear.\n\nTwo days later Bones arrived at the city of the Akasava, bringing with\nhim no greater protection than a Houssa orderly afforded.\n\n\nIII\n\nOn a certain night in September Mr. Commissioner Sanders was the guest\nof the Colonial Secretary at his country seat in Berkshire.\n\nSanders, who was no society man, either by training or by inclination,\nwould have preferred wandering aimlessly about the brilliantly lighted\nstreets of London, but the engagement was a long-standing one. In a\nsense he was a lion against his will. His name was known, people had\nwritten of his character and his sayings; he had even, to his own\namazement, delivered a lecture before the members of the Ethnological\nSociety on \"Native Folk-lore,\" and had emerged from the ordeal\ntriumphantly. The guests of Lord Castleberry found Sanders a shy, silent\nman who could not be induced to talk of the land he loved so dearly.\nThey might have voted him a bore, but for the fact that he so completely\neffaced himself they had little opportunity for forming so definite a\njudgment.\n\nIt was on the second night of his visit to Newbury Grange that they had\ncornered him in the billiard-room. It was the beautiful daughter of Lord\nCastleberry who, with the audacity of youth, forced him, metaphorically\nspeaking, into a corner, from whence there was no escape.\n\n\"We've been very patient, Mr. Sanders,\" she pouted; \"we are all dying to\nhear of your wonderful country, and Bosambo, and fetishes and things,\nand you haven't said a word.\"\n\n\"There is little to say,\" he smiled; \"perhaps if I told you--something\nabout fetishes...?\"\n\nThere was a chorus of approval.\n\nSanders had gained enough courage from his experience before the\nEthnological Society, and began to talk.\n\n\"Wait,\" said Lady Betty; \"let's have all these glaring lights out--they\nlimit our imagination.\"\n\nThere was a click, and, save for one bracket light behind Sanders, the\nroom was in darkness. He was grateful to the girl, and well rewarded her\nand the party that sat round on chairs, on benches around the edge of\nthe billiard-table, listening. He told them stories ... curious,\nunbelievable; of ghost palavers, of strange rites, of mysterious\nmessages carried across the great space of forests.\n\n\"Tell us about fetishes,\" said the girl's voice.\n\nSanders smiled. There rose to his eyes the spectacle of a hot and weary\npeople bringing in a giant tree through the forest, inch by inch.\n\nAnd he told the story of the fetish of the Akasava.\n\n\"And I said,\" he concluded, \"that I would come from the end of the\nworld----\"\n\nHe stopped suddenly and stared straight ahead. In the faint light they\nsaw him stiffen like a setter.\n\n\"What is wrong?\"\n\nLord Castleberry was on his feet, and somebody clicked on the lights.\n\nBut Sanders did not notice.\n\nHe was looking towards the end of the room, and his face was set and\nhard.\n\n\"O, M'fosa,\" he snarled, \"O, dog!\"\n\nThey heard the strange staccato of the Bomongo tongue and wondered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLieutenant Tibbetts, helmetless, his coat torn, his lip bleeding,\noffered no resistance when they strapped him to the smooth high pole.\nAlmost at his feet lay the dead Houssa orderly whom M'fosa had struck\ndown from behind.\n\nIn a wide circle, their faces half revealed by the crackling fire which\nburnt in the centre, the people of the Akasava city looked on\nimpressively.\n\nN'gori, the chief, his brows all wrinkled in terror, his shaking hands\nat his mouth in a gesture of fear, was no more than a spectator, for his\nmasterful son limped from side to side, consulting his counsellors.\n\nPresently the men who had bound Bones stepped aside, their work\ncompleted, and M'fosa came limping across to his prisoners.\n\n\"Now,\" he mocked. \"Is it hard for you this fetish stick which Sandi has\nplaced?\"\n\n\"You're a low cad,\" said Bones, dropping into English in his wrath.\n\"You're a low, beastly bounder, an' I'm simply disgusted with you.\"\n\n\"What does he say?\" they asked M'fosa.\n\n\"He speaks to his gods in his own tongue,\" answered the limper; \"for he\nis greatly afraid.\"\n\nLieutenant Tibbetts went on:\n\n\"Hear,\" said he in fluent and vitriolic Bomongo--for he was using that\nfisher dialect which he knew so much better than the more sonorous\ntongue of the Upper River--\"O hear, eater of fish, O lame dog, O\nnameless child of a monkey!\"\n\nM'fosa's lips went up one-sidedly.\n\n\"Lord,\" said he softly, \"presently you shall say no more, for I will cut\nyour tongue out that you shall be lame of speech ... afterwards I will\nburn you and the fetish stick, so that you all tumble together.\"\n\n\"Be sure you will tumble into hell,\" said Bones cheerfully, \"and that\nquickly, for you have offended Sandi's Ju-ju, which is powerful and\nterrible.\"\n\nIf he could gain time--time for some miraculous news to come to\nHamilton, who, blissfully unconscious of the treachery to his\nsecond-in-command, was sleeping twenty miles downstream--unconscious,\ntoo, of the Akasava fleet of canoes which was streaming towards his\nlittle steamer.\n\nPerhaps M'fosa guessed his thoughts.\n\n\"You die alone, Tibbetti,\" he said, \"though I planned a great death for\nyou, with Bosambo at your side; and in the matter of ju-jus, behold! you\nshall call for Sandi--whilst you have a tongue.\"\n\nHe took from the raw-hide sheath that was strapped to the calf of his\nbare leg, a short N'gombi knife, and drew it along the palm of his hand.\n\n\"Call now, O Moon-in-the-Eye!\" he scoffed.\n\nBones saw the horror and braced himself to meet it.\n\n\"O Sandi!\" cried M'fosa, \"O planter of ju-ju, come quickly!\"\n\n\"Dog!\"\n\nM'fosa whipped round, the knife dropping from his hand.\n\nHe knew the voice, was paralysed by the concentrated malignity in the\nvoice.\n\nThere stood Sandi--not half a dozen paces from him.\n\nA Sandi in strange black clothing with a big white-breasted shirt ...\nbut Sandi, hard-eyed and threatening.\n\n\"Lord, lord!\" he stammered, and put up his hands to his eyes.\n\nHe looked again--the figure had vanished.\n\n\"Magic!\" he mumbled, and lurched forward in terror and hate to finish\nhis work.\n\nThen through the crowd stalked a tall man.\n\nA rope of monkeys' tails covers one broad shoulder; his left arm and\nhand were hidden by an oblong shield of hide.\n\nIn one hand he held a slim throwing spear and this he balanced\ndelicately.\n\n\"I am Bosambo of the Ochori,\" he said magnificently and unnecessarily;\n\"you sent for me and I have come--bringing a thousand spears.\"\n\nM'fosa blinked, but said nothing.\n\n\"On the river,\" Bosambo went on, \"I met many canoes that went to a\nkilling--behold!\"\n\nIt was the head of M'fosa's lieutenant, who had charge of the surprise\nparty.\n\nFor a moment M'fosa looked, then turned to leap, and Bosambo's spear\ncaught him in mid-air.\n\n\"Jolly old Bosambo!\" muttered Bones, and fainted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFour thousand miles away Sanders was offering his apologies to a\nstartled company.\n\n\"I could have sworn I saw--something,\" he said, and he told no more\nstories that night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nA FRONTIER AND A CODE\n\n\nTo understand this story you must know that at one point of Ochori\nborderline, the German, French, and Belgian territories shoot three\nnarrow tongues that form, roughly, the segments of a half-circle.\nWhether the German tongue is split in the middle by N'glili River, so\nthat it forms a flattened broad arrow, with the central prong the river\nis a moot point. We, in Downing Street, claim that the lower angle of\nthis arrow is wholly ours, and that all the flat basin of the Field of\nBlood (as they call it) is entitled to receive the shadow which a\nflapping Union Jack may cast.\n\nIf Downing Street were to send that frantic code-wire to \"Polonius\" to\nHamilton in these days he could not obey the instructions, for reasons\nwhich I will give. As a matter of fact the code has now been changed,\nLieutenant Tibbetts being mainly responsible for the alteration.\n\nHamilton, in his severest mood, wrote a letter to Bones, and it is worth\nreproducing.\n\nThat Bones was living a dozen yards from Captain Hamilton, and that they\nshared a common mess-table, adds rather than distracts from the\nseriousness of the correspondence. The letter ran:\n\n                \"The Residency,\n                    \"September 24th.\n\n     \"From Officer commanding Houssas detachment Headquarters, to\n     Officer commanding \"B\" company of Houssas.\n\n     \"Sir,--\n\n     \"I have the honour to direct your attention to that paragraph of\n     King's regulations which directs that an officer's sole attention\n     should be concentrated upon executing the lawful commands of his\n     superior.\n\n     \"I have had occasion recently to correct a certain tendency on your\n     part to employing War Department property and the servants of the\n     Crown for your own special use. I need hardly point out to you that\n     such conduct on your part is subversive to discipline and directly\n     contrary to the spirit and letter of regulations. More especially\n     would I urge the impropriety of utilizing government telegraph\n     lines for the purpose of securing information regarding your\n     gambling transactions. Matters have now reached a very serious\n     crisis, and I feel sure that you will see the necessity for\n     refraining from these breaches of discipline.\n\n          \"I have the honour to be, sir,\n               \"Your obedient servant,\n                    \"P. G. Hamilton, 'Captain.'\"\n\nWhen two white men, the only specimen of their race and class within a\nradius of hundreds of miles, are living together in an isolated post,\nthey either hate or tolerate one another. The exception must always be\nfound in two men of a similar service having similar objects to gain,\nand infused with a common spirit of endeavour.\n\nFortunately neither Lieutenant Tibbetts nor his superior were long\nenough associated to get upon one another's nerves.\n\nLieutenant Tibbetts received this letter while he was shaving, and came\nacross the parade ground outrageously attired in his pyjamas and his\nhelmet. Clambering up the wooden stairs, his slippers flap-flapping\nacross the broad verandah, he burst into the chief's bedroom,\ninterrupting a stern and frigid Captain Hamilton in the midst of his\nearly morning coffee and roll.\n\n\"Look here, old sport,\" said Bones, indignantly waving a frothy shaving\nbrush at the other, \"what the dooce is all this about?\"\n\nHe displayed a crumpled letter.\n\n\"Lieutenant Tibbetts,\" said Hamilton of the Houssas severely, \"have you\nno sense of decency?\"\n\n\"Sense of decency, my dear old thing!\" repeated Bones. \"I am simply full\nof it. That is why I have come.\"\n\nA terrible sight was Bones at that early hour with the open pyjama\njacket showing his scraggy neck, with his fish mouth drooping dismally,\nhis round, staring eyes and his hair rumpled up, one frantic tuft at\nthe back standing up in isolation.\n\nHamilton stared at him, and it was the stern stare of a disciplinarian.\nBut Bones was not to be put out of countenance by so small a thing as an\nicy glance.\n\n\"There is no sense in getting peevish with me, old Ham,\" he said,\nsquatting down on the nearest chair; \"this is what I call a stupid,\nofficious, unnecessary letter. Why this haughtiness? Why these crushing\ninferences? Why this unkindness to poor old Bones?\"\n\n\"The fact of it is, Bones,\" said Hamilton, accepting the situation, \"you\nare spending too much of your time in the telegraph station.\"\n\nBones got up slowly.\n\n\"Captain Hamilton, sir!\" he said reproachfully, \"after all I have done\nfor you.\"\n\n\"Beyond selling me one of your beastly sweepstake tickets for five\nshillings,\" said Hamilton, unpleasantly; \"a ticket which I dare say you\nhave taken jolly good care will not win a prize, I fail to see in what\nmanner you have helped me. Now, Bones, you will have to pay more\nattention to your work. There is no sense in slacking; we will have\nSanders back here before we know where we are, and when he starts nosing\nround there will be a lot of trouble. Besides, you are shirking.\"\n\n\"Me!\" gasped Bones, outraged. \"Me--shirking? You forget yourself, sir!\"\n\nEven Bones could not be dignified with a lather brush in one hand and a\nhalf-shaven cheek, testifying to the hastiness of his departure from\nhis quarters.\n\n\"I only wish to say, sir,\" said Bones, \"that during the period I have\nhad the honour to serve under your command I have settled possibly more\npalavers of a distressingly ominous character than the average\nCommissioner is called upon to settle in the course of a year.\"\n\n\"As you have created most of the palavers yourself,\" said Hamilton\nunkindly, \"I do not deny this. In other words, you have got yourself\ninto more tangles, and you've had to crawl out more often.\"\n\n\"It is useless appealing to your better nature, sir,\" said Bones.\n\nHe saluted with the hand that held the lather brush, turned about like\nan automaton, tripped over the mat, recovered himself with an effort,\nand preserving what dignity a man can preserve in pink-striped pyjamas\nand a sun helmet, stalked majestically back to his quarters. Half-way\nacross he remembered something and came doubling back, clattering into\nHamilton's room unceremoniously.\n\n\"There is one thing I forgot to say,\" he said, \"about those sweepstake\ntickets. If I happen to be killed on any future expedition that you may\nsend me, you will understand that the whole of my moveable property is\nyours, absolutely. And I may add, sir,\" he said at the doorway with one\nhand on the lintel ready to execute a strategic flank movement out of\nrange, \"that with this legacy I offer you my forgiveness for the\nperfectly beastly time you have given me. Good morning, sir.\"\n\nThere was a commanding officer's parade of Houssas at noon. It was not\nuntil he stalked across the square and clicked his heels together as he\nreported the full strength of his company present that Hamilton saw his\nsubordinate again.\n\nThe parade over, Bones went huffily to his quarters.\n\nHe was hurt. To be told he had been shirking his duty touched a very\ntender and sensitive spot of his.\n\nIn preparation for the movement which he had expected to make he had\nkept his company on the move for a fortnight. For fourteen terrible days\nin all kinds of weather, he had worked like a native in the forest; with\nsham fights and blank cartridge attacks upon imaginary positions, with\nscaling of stockades and building of bridges--all work at which his soul\nrevolted--to be told at the end he had shirked his work!\n\nCertainly he had come down to headquarters more often perhaps than was\nnecessary, but then he was properly interested in the draw of a\ncontinental sweepstake which might, with any kind of luck, place him in\nthe possession of a considerable fortune. Hamilton was amiable at lunch,\neven communicative at dinner, and for him rather serious.\n\nFor if the truth be told he was desperately worried. The cause was, as\nit had often been with Sanders, that French-German-Belgian territory\nwhich adjoins the Ochori country. All the bad characters, not only the\nFrench of the Belgian Congo, but of the badly-governed German lands--all\nthe tax resisters, the murderers, and the criminals of every kind, but\nthe lawless contingents of every nation, formed a floating nomadic\npopulation in the tree-covered hills which lay beyond the country\ngoverned by Bosambo.\n\nOf late there had been a larger break-away than usual. A strong force of\nrebellious natives was reported to be within a day's march of the Ochori\nboundary. This much Hamilton knew. But he had known of such occurrences\nbefore; not once, but a score of times had alarming news come from the\nFrench border.\n\nHe had indeed made many futile trips into the heart of the Ochori\ncountry.\n\nForced marches through little known territory, and long and tiring waits\nfor the invader that never came, had dulled his senses of apprehension.\nHe had to take a chance. The Administrator's office would warn him from\ntime to time, and ask him conventionally to make his arrangements to\nmeet all contingencies and Sanders would as conventionally reply that\nthe condition of affairs on the Ochori border was engaging his most\nearnest attention.\n\n\"What is the use of worrying about it now?\" asked Bones at dinner.\n\nHamilton shook his head.\n\n\"There was a certain magic in old Sanders' name,\" he said.\n\nBones' lips pursed.\n\n\"My dear old chap,\" he said, \"there is a bit of magic in mine.\"\n\n\"I have not noticed it,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"I am getting awfully popular as a matter of fact,\" said Bones\ncomplacently. \"The last time I was up the river, Bosambo came ten miles\ndown stream to meet me and spend the day.\"\n\n\"Did you lose anything?\" asked Hamilton ungraciously.\n\nBones thought.\n\n\"Now you come to mention it,\" he said slowly, \"I did lose quite a lot of\nthings, but dear old Bosambo wouldn't play a dirty trick on a pal. I\nknow Bosambo.\"\n\n\"If there is one thing more evident than another,\" said Hamilton, \"it is\nthat you do not know Bosambo.\"\n\nHamilton was wakened at three in the next morning by the telegraph\noperator. It was a \"clear the line\" message, coded from headquarters,\nand half awake he went into Sanders' study and put it into plain\nEnglish.\n\n\"Hope you are watching the Ochori border,\" it ran, \"representations from\nFrench Government to the effect that a crossing is imminent.\"\n\nHe pulled his mosquito boots on over his pyjamas, struggled into a coat\nand crossed to Lieutenant Tibbetts' quarters.\n\nBones occupied a big hut at the end of the Houssa lines, and Hamilton\nwoke him by the simple expedient of flashing his electric hand lamp in\nhis face.\n\n\"I have had a telegram,\" he said, and Bones leapt out of bed wide awake\nin an instant.\n\n\"I knew jolly well I would draw a horse,\" he said exultantly. \"I had a\ndream----\"\n\n\"Be serious, you feather-minded devil.\"\n\nWith that Hamilton handed him the telegram.\n\nBones read it carefully, and interpreted any meanings into its\nconstruction which it could not possibly bear.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" he asked.\n\n\"There is only one thing to do,\" said Hamilton. \"We shall have to take\nall the men we can possibly muster, and go north at daybreak.\"\n\n\"Spoken like a jolly old Hannibal,\" said Bones heartily, and smacked his\nsuperior on the back. A shrill bugle call aroused the sleeping lines,\nand Hamilton went back to his quarters to make preparations for the\njourney. In the first grey light of dawn he flew three pigeons to\nBosambo, and the message they carried about their red legs was brief.\n\n\"Take your fighting regiments to the edge of Frenchi land; presently I\nwill come with my soldiers and support you. Let no foreigner pass on\nyour life and on your head.\"\n\nWhen the rising sun tipped the tops of the palms with gold, and the wild\nworld was filled with the sound of the birds, the _Zaire_, her decks\nalive with soldiers, began her long journey northward.\n\nJust before the boat left, Hamilton received a further message from the\nAdministrator. It was in plain English, some evidence of Sir Robert\nSanleigh's haste.\n\n     \"Confidential: This matter on the Ochori border extremely delicate.\n     Complete adequate arrangements to keep in touch with me.\"\n\nFor one moment Hamilton conceived the idea of leaving Bones behind to\ndeal with the telegram and come along. A little thought, however,\nconvinced him of the futility of this method. For one thing he would\nwant every bit of assistance he could get, and although Bones had his\ndisadvantages he was an excellent soldier, and a loyal and gallant\ncomrade.\n\nIt might be necessary for Hamilton to divide up his forces; in which\ncase he could hardly dispense with Lieutenant Tibbetts, and he explained\nunnecessarily to Bones:\n\n\"I think you are much better under my eye where I can see what you're\ndoing.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Bones very seriously, \"it is not what I do, it is what I\nthink. If you could only see my brain at work----\"\n\n\"Ha, ha!\" said Hamilton rudely.\n\nFor at least three days relations were strained between the two\nofficers. Bones was a man who admitted at regular intervals that he was\nunduly sensitive. He had explained this disadvantage to Hamilton at\nvarious times, but the Houssa stolidly refused to remember the fact.\n\nMost of the way up the river Hamilton attended to his business\nnavigation--he knew the stream very well--whilst Bones, in a cabin which\nhad been rigged up for him in the after part of the ship, played\nPatience, and by a systematic course of cheating himself was able to\naccomplish marvels. They found the Ochori city deserted save for a\nstrong guard, for Bosambo had marched the day previous; sending a war\ncall through the country.\n\nHe had started with a thousand spears, and his force was growing in\nsnowball fashion as he progressed through the land. The great road which\nNotiki, the northern chief, had started by way of punishment was\nbeginning to take shape. Bosambo had moved with incredible swiftness.\n\nToo swift, indeed, for a certain Angolian-Congo robber who had headed a\nvillainous pilgrimage to a land which, as he had predicted, flowed with\nmilk and honey; was guarded by timorous men and mainly populated by slim\nand beautiful maidens. The Blue Books on this migration gave this man's\nname as Kisini, but he was in fact an Angolian named Bizaro--a composite\nname which smacks suspiciously of Portuguese influence.\n\nMany times had the unruly people and the lawless bands which occupied\nthe forest beyond the Ochori threatened to cross into British territory.\nBut the dangers of the unknown, the awful stories of a certain white\nlord who was swift to avenge and monstrously inquisitive had held them.\nYear after year there had grown up tribes within tribes, tiny armed\ncamps that had only this in common, that they were outside the laws\nfrom which they had fled, and that somewhere to the southward and the\neastward were strong forces flying the tricolour of France or the yellow\nstar of the Belgian Congo, ready to belch fire at them, if they so much\nas showed their flat noses.\n\nIt would have needed a Napoleon to have combined all the conflicting\nforces, to have lulled all the mutual suspicions, and to have moulded\nthese incompatible particles into a whole; but, Bizaro, like many\nanother vain and ambitious man, had sought by means of a great palaver\nto produce a feeling of security sufficiently soothing to the nerves and\nsusceptibilities of all elements, to create something like a nationality\nof these scattered remnants of the nations.\n\nAnd though he failed, he did succeed in bringing together four or five\nof the camps, and it was this news carried to the French Governor by\nspies, transmitted to Downing Street, and flashed back again to the\nCoast, which set Hamilton and his Houssas moving; which brought a\nregiment of the King's African Rifles to the Coast ready to reinforce\nthe earlier expedition, and which (more to the point) had put Bosambo's\nwar drums rumbling from one end of the Ochori to the other.\n\nBizaro, mustering his force, came gaily through the sun-splashed aisles\nof the forest, his face streaked hideously with camwood, his big\nelephant spear twirled between his fingers, and behind him straggled his\ncosmopolitan force.\n\nThere were men from the Congo and the French Congo; men from German\nlands; from Angola; wanderers from far-off Barotseland, who had drifted\non to the Congo by the swift and yellow Kasai. There were hunters from\nthe forests of far-off Bongindanga where the _okapi_ roams. For each\nman's presence in that force there was good and sinister reason, for\nthese were no mere tax-evaders, poor, starved wretches fleeing from the\nrule which _Bula Matadi_[4] imposed. There was a blood price on almost\nevery head, and in a dozen prisons at Boma, at Brazaville, and\nEquatorville, and as far south as St. Paul de Loduda, there were\nleg-irons which had at some time or other fitted their scarred ankles.\n\n[Footnote 4: The stone breaker, the native name for the Congo\nGovernment.]\n\nNow there are four distinct physical features which mark the border line\nbetween the border land and the foreign territory. Mainly the line is a\npurely imaginary one, not traceable save by the most delicate\ninstruments--a line which runs through a tangle of forest.\n\nBut the most noticeable crossing place is N'glili.[5]\n\n[Footnote 5: Probably a corruption of the word \"English.\"]\n\nHere a little river, easily fordable, and not more than a dozen spear\nlengths across flows from one wood into another. Between the two woods\nis a clear space of thick grass and shrub. In the spring of the year the\nbanks of the stream are white with arum-lilies, and the field beyond,\nat a later period, is red with wild anemone.\n\nThe dour fugitives on the other side of the stream have a legend that\nthose who safely cross the \"Field of Blood\"--so they call the\nanemone-sprinkled land beyond--without so much as crushing a flower may\nclaim sanctuary under the British flag.\n\nSo that when Bizaro sighted the stream, and the two tall trees that\nflanked the ford, from afar off and said: \"To-day we will walk between\nthe flowers,\" he was signifying the definite character of his plans.\n\n\"Master,\" said one of the more timid of his muster, when they had halted\nfor a rest in sight of the promised land, \"what shall we do when we come\nto these strange places?\"\n\n\"We shall defeat all manner of men,\" said Bizaro optimistically.\n\"Afterwards they shall come and sue for peace, and they shall give us a\nwide land where we may build us huts and sow our corn. And they also\nwill give us women, and we shall settle in comfort, and I will be chief\nover you. And, growing with the moons, in time I shall make you a great\nnation.\"\n\nThey might have crossed the stream that evening and committed themselves\nirrevocably to their invasion. Bizaro was a criminal, and a lazy man,\nand he decided to sleep where he was--an act fatal to the smooth\nperformance of his enterprise, for when in the early hours of the\nmorning he marched his horde to the N'glili river he found two thousand\nspears lining the opposite bank, and they were under a chief who was at\nonce insolent and unmoved by argument.\n\n\"O chief,\" said Bosambo pleasantly, \"you do not cross my beautiful\nflowers to-day.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said Bizaro humbly, \"we are poor men who desire a new land.\"\n\n\"That you shall have,\" said Bosambo grimly, \"for I have sent my warriors\nto dig big holes wherein you may take your rest in this land you\ndesire.\"\n\nAn unhappy Bizaro carried his six hundred spears slowly back to the land\nfrom whence he had come and found on return to the mixed tribes that he\nhad unconsciously achieved a miracle. For the news of armed men by the\nN'glili river carried terror to these evil men--they found themselves\nbetween two enemies and chose the force which they feared least.\n\nOn the fourth day following his interview with Bosambo, Bizaro led five\nthousand desperate men to the ford and there was a sanguinary battle\nwhich lasted for the greater part of the morning and was repeated at\nsundown.\n\nHamilton brought his Houssas up in the nick of time, when one wing of\nBosambo's force was being thrust back and when Bizaro's desperate\nadventurers had gained the Ochori bank. Hamilton came through the\nclearing, and formed his men rapidly.\n\nSword in hand, in advance of the glittering bayonets, Bones raced\nacross the red field, and after one brief and glorious m\u00eal\u00e9e the invader\nwas driven back, and a dropping fire from the left, as the Houssas shot\nsteadily at the flying enemy, completed the disaster to Bizaro's force.\n\n\"That settles _that_!\" said Hamilton.\n\nHe had pitched his camp on the scene of his exploit, the bivouac fires\nof the Houssas gleamed redly amongst the anemones.\n\n\"Did you see me in action?\" asked Bones, a little self-consciously.\n\n\"No, I didn't notice anything particularly striking about the fight in\nyour side of the world,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"I suppose you did not see me bowl over a big Congo chap?\" asked Bones,\ncarelessly, as he opened a tin of preserved tongue. \"Two at once I\nbowled over,\" he repeated.\n\n\"What do you expect me to do?\" asked Hamilton unpleasantly. \"Get up and\ncheer, or recommend you for the Victoria Cross or something?\"\n\nBones carefully speared a section of tongue from the open tin before he\nreplied.\n\n\"I had not thought about the Victoria Cross, to tell you the truth,\" he\nadmitted; \"but if you feel that you ought to recommend me for something\nor other for conspicuous courage in the face of the enemy, do not let\nyour friendship stand in the way.\"\n\n\"I will not,\" said Hamilton.\n\nThere was a little pause, then without raising his eyes from the task in\nhand which was at that precise moment the covering of a biscuit with a\nlarge and generous layer of marmalade, Bones went on.\n\n\"I practically saved the life of one of Bosambo's headmen. He was on the\nground and three fellows were jabbing at him. The moment they saw me\nthey dropped their spears and fled.\"\n\n\"I expect it was your funny nose that did the trick,\" said Hamilton\nunimpressed.\n\n\"I stood there,\" Bones went on loftily ignoring the gratuitous insult,\n\"waiting for anything that might turn up; exposed, dear old fellow, to\nevery death-dealing missile, but calmly directing, if you will allow me\nto say so, the tide of battle. It was,\" he added modestly, \"one of the\nbravest deeds I ever saw.\"\n\nHe waited, but Hamilton had his mouth full of tongue sandwich.\n\n\"If you mention me in dispatches,\" Bones went on suggestively.\n\n\"Don't worry--I shan't,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"But if you did,\" persisted Lieutenant Tibbetts, poising his sticky\nbiscuit, \"I can only say----\"\n\n\"The marmalade is running down your sleeve,\" said Hamilton; \"shut up,\nBones, like a good chap.\"\n\nBones sighed.\n\n\"The fact of it is, Hamilton,\" he was frank enough to say, \"I have been\nserving so far without hope of reward and scornful of honour, but now I\nhave reached the age and the position in life where I feel I am entitled\nto some slight recognition to solace my declining years.\"\n\n\"How long have you been in the army?\" asked Hamilton, curiously.\n\n\"Eighteen months,\" replied Bones; \"nineteen months next week, and it's a\njolly long time, I can tell you, sir.\"\n\nLeaving his dissatisfied subordinate, Hamilton made the round of the\ncamp. The red field, as he called it, was in reality a low-lying meadow,\nwhich rose steeply to the bank of the river on the one side and more\nsteeply--since it first sloped downward in that direction--to the Ochori\nforest, two miles away. He made this discovery with a little feeling of\nalarm. He knew something of native tactics, and though his scouts had\nreported that the enemy was effectually routed, and that the nearest\nbody was five miles away, he put a strong advance picquet on the other\nside of the river, and threw a wide cordon of sentries about the camp.\nEspecially he apportioned Abiboo, his own sergeant, the task of watching\nthe little river which flowed swiftly between its orderly banks past the\nsunken camp. For two days Abiboo watched and found nothing to report.\n\nNot so the spies who were keeping watch upon the moving remnants of\nBizaro's army.\n\nThey came with the news that the main body had mysteriously disappeared.\nTo add to Hamilton's anxiety he received a message by way of\nheadquarters and the Ochori city from the Administrator.\n\n     \"Be prepared at the first urgent message from myself to fall back\n     on the Ochori city. German Government claim that whole of country\n     for two miles north of river N'glili is their territory. Most\n     delicate situation. International complications feared. Rely on\n     your discretion, but move swiftly if you receive orders.\"\n\n\"Leave this to me,\" said Bones when Hamilton read the message out; \"did\nI ever tell you, sir, that I was intended for the diplomatic\nservice----\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe truth about the Ochori border has never been thoroughly exposed. If\nyou get into your mind the fact that the Imperialists of four nations\nwere dreaming dreams of a trans-African railway which was to tap the\nresources of the interior, and if you remember that each patriotic\ndreamer conceived a different kind of railway according to his\nnationality and that they only agreed upon one point, namely, that the\nline must point contiguous with the Ochori border, you may understand\ndimly some reason for the frantic claim that that little belt of\nterritory, two miles wide, was part of the domain of each and every one\nof the contestants.\n\nWhen the news was flashed to Europe that a party of British Houssas were\nholding the banks of the N'glili river, and had inflicted a loss upon a\nforce of criminals, the approval which civilization should rightly have\nbestowed upon Captain Hamilton and his heroic lieutenant was tempered\nlargely by the question as to whether Captain Hamilton and his Houssas\nhad any right whatever to be upon \"the red field.\" And in consequence\nthe telegraph lines between Berlin and Paris and Paris and London and\nLondon and Brussels were kept fairly busy with passionate statements of\nclaims couched in the stilted terminology of diplomacy.\n\nEngland could not recede from the position she had taken. This she said\nin French and in German, and in her own perfidious tongue. She stated\nthis uncompromisingly, but at the same time sent secret orders to\nwithdraw the force that was the bone of contention. This order she soon\ncountermanded. A certain speech delivered by a too voluble Belgian\nminister was responsible for the stiffening of her back, and His\nExcellency the Administrator of the territory received official\ninstructions in the middle of the night: \"Tell Hamilton to stay where he\nis and hold border against all comers.\"\n\nThis message was re-transmitted.\n\nNow there is in existence in the British Colonial Service, and in all\nbranches which affect the agents and the servants of the Colonial\nOffice, an emergency code which is based upon certain characters in\nShakespearean plays.\n\nI say \"there is\"; perhaps it would be better and more to the point if I\nsaid \"there was,\" since the code has been considerably amended.\n\nThus, be he sub-inspector or commissioner, or chief of local native\npolice who receives the word \"Ophelia,\" he knows without consulting any\nbook that \"Ophelia\" means \"unrest of natives reported in your district,\nplease report\"; or if it be \"Polonius\" it signifies to him--and this he\nknows without confirming his knowledge--that he must move steadily\nforward. Or if it be \"Banquo\" he reads into it, \"Hold your position till\nfurther orders.\" And \"Banquo\" was the word that the Administrator\ntelegraphed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSergeant Abiboo had sat by the flowing N'glili river without noticing\nany slackening of its strength or challenging of its depth.\n\nThere was reason for this.\n\nBizaro, who was in the forest ten miles to the westward, and working\nmoreover upon a piece of native strategy which natives the world over\nhad found successful, saw that it was unnecessary to dam the river and\ndivert the stream.\n\nNature had assisted him to a marvellous degree. He had followed the\nstream through the forest until he reached a place where it was a\nquarter of a mile wide, so wide and so newly spread that the water\nreached half-way up the trunks of the sodden and dying trees.\n\nMoreover, there was a bank through which a hundred men might cut a\nbreach in a day or so, even though they went about their work most\nleisurely, being constitutionally averse to manual labour.\n\nBizaro was no engineer, but he had all the forest man's instincts of\nwater-levels. There was a clear run down to the meadows beyond that, as\nhe said, he \"smelt.\"\n\n\"We will drown these dogs,\" he said to his headman, \"and afterwards we\nwill walk into the country and take it for our own.\"\n\nHamilton had been alive to the danger of such an attack. He saw by\ncertain indications of the soil that this great shallow valley had been\ninundated more than once, though probably many years had passed since\nthe last overflow of water. Yet he could not move from where he had\nplanted himself without risking the displeasure of his chief and without\nalso risking very serious consequences in other directions.\n\nBosambo, frankly bored, was all for retiring his men to the comforts of\nthe Ochori city.\n\n\"Lord, why do we sit here?\" he asked, \"looking at this little stream\nwhich has no fish and at this great ugly country, when I have my\nbeautiful city for your lordship's reception, and dancing folk and great\nfeasts?\"\n\n\"A doocid sensible idea,\" murmured Bones.\n\n\"I wait for a book,\" answered Hamilton shortly. \"If you wish to go, you\nmay take your soldiers and leave me.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said Bosambo, \"you put shame on me,\" and he looked his reproach.\n\n\"I am really surprised at you, Hamilton,\" murmured Bones.\n\n\"Keep your infernal comments to yourself,\" snapped his superior. \"I tell\nyou I must wait for my instructions.\"\n\nHe was a silent man for the rest of the evening, and had settled himself\ndown in his canvas chair to doze away the night, when a travel-stained\nmessenger came from the Ochori and he brought a telegram of one word.\n\nHamilton looked at it, he looked too with a frown at the figures that\npreceded it.\n\n\"And what you mean,\" he muttered, \"the Lord knows!\"\n\nThe word, however, was sufficiently explicit. A bugle call brought the\nHoussas into line and the tapping of Bosambo's drums assembled his\nwarriors.\n\nWithin half an hour of the receipt of the message Hamilton's force was\non the move.\n\nThey crossed the great stretch of meadow in the darkness and were\nclimbing up towards the forest when a noise like thunder broke upon\ntheir ears.\n\nSuch a roaring, crashing, hissing of sound came nearer and nearer,\nincreasing in volume every second. The sky was clear, and one swift\nglance told Hamilton that it was not a storm he had to fear. And then it\ncame upon him, and he realized what this commotion meant.\n\n\"Run!\" he cried, and with one accord naked warriors and uniformed\nHoussas fled through the darkness to the higher ground. The water came\nrushing about Hamilton's ankles, one man slipped back again into the\nflood and was hauled out again by Bones, exclaiming loudly his own act\nlest it should have escaped the attention of his superior, and the party\nreached safety without the loss of a man.\n\n\"Just in time,\" said Hamilton grimly. \"I wonder if the Administrator\nknew this was going to happen?\"\n\nThey came to the Ochori by easy marches, and Hamilton wrote a long wire\nto headquarters sending it on ahead by a swift messenger.\n\nIt was a dispatch which cleared away many difficulties, for the disputed\nterritory was for everlasting under water, and where the \"red field\" had\nblazed brilliantly was a calm stretch of river two miles wide filled\nwith strange silent brown objects that floated and bobbed to the\nmovement of the tide. These were the men who in their folly had loosened\nthe waters and died of their rashness. Most notable of these was Bizaro.\n\nThere was a shock waiting for Hamilton when he reached the Ochori city.\nThe wire from the Administrator was kindly enough and sufficiently\napproving to satisfy even an exigent Bones. \"But,\" it ran, \"why did you\nretire in face of stringent orders to remain? I wired you 'Banquo.'\"\n\nHamilton afterwards learnt that the messenger carrying this important\ndispatch had passed his party in their retirement through the forest.\n\n\"Banquo,\" quoted Hamilton in amazement. \"I received absolute\ninstructions to retire.\"\n\n\"Hard cheese,\" said Bones, sympathetically. \"His dear old Excellency\nwants a good talking to; but are you sure, dear old chap, that you\nhaven't made a mistake.\"\n\n\"Here it is,\" he said, \"but I must confess that I don't understand the\nnumbers.\"\n\nHe handed it to Bones. It read:\n\n                    \"Mercutio 17178.\"\n\nBones looked at it a moment, then gasped. He reached out his hand\nsolemnly and grasped that of the astounded Hamilton.\n\n\"Dear old fellow,\" he said in a broken voice, \"Congratulate me, I have\ndrawn a runner!\"\n\n\"A runner?\"\n\n\"A runner, dear old sport,\" chortled Bones, \"in the Cambridgeshire! You\nsee I've got a ticket number seventeen, seventeen eight in my pocket,\ndear old friend! If Mercutio wins,\" he repeated solemnly, \"I will stand\nyou the finest dinner that can be secured this side of Romano's.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE SOUL OF THE NATIVE WOMAN\n\n\nMail day is ever a day of supreme interest for the young and for the\nmatter of that for the middle-aged, too. Sanders hated mail days because\nthe bulk of his correspondence had to do with Government, and Government\nnever sat down with a pen in its hand to wish Sanders many happy returns\nof the day or to tell him scandalous stories about mutual friends.\n\nRather the Government (by inference) told him scandalous stories about\nhimself--of work not completed to the satisfaction of Downing Street--a\nthoroughfare given to expecting miracles.\n\nHamilton had a sister who wrote wittily and charmingly every week, and\nthere was another girl ... Still, two letters and a bright pink paper or\ntwo made a modest postbag by the side of Lieutenant Tibbetts' mail.\n\nThere came to Bones every mail day a thick wad of letters and parcels\ninnumerable, and he could sit at the big table for hours on end,\nwhistling a little out of tune, mumbling incoherently. He had a trick of\ncommenting upon his letters aloud, which was very disconcerting for\nHamilton. Bones wouldn't open a letter and get half-way through it\nbefore he began his commenting.\n\n\"... poor soul ... dear! dear! ... what a silly old ass ... ah, would\nyou ... don't do it, Billy....\"\n\nTo Hamilton's eyes the bulk of correspondence rather increased than\ndiminished.\n\n\"You must owe a lot of money,\" he said one day.\n\n\"Eh!\"\n\n\"All these...!\" Hamilton opened his hand to a floor littered with\ndiscarded envelopes. \"I suppose they represent demands....\"\n\n\"Dear lad,\" said Bones brightly, \"they represent popularity--I'm\nimmensely popular, sir,\" he gulped a little as he fished out two dainty\nenvelopes from the pile before him; \"you may not have experienced the\nsensation, but I assure you, sir, it's pleasing, it's doocidly\npleasing!\"\n\n\"Complacent ass,\" said Hamilton, and returned to his own correspondence.\n\nSystematically Bones went through his letters, now and again consulting\na neat little morocco-covered note-book. (It would appear he kept a very\ncareful record of every letter he wrote home, its contents, the date of\nits dispatch, and the reply thereto.) He had reduced letter writing to a\npassion, spent most of his evenings writing long epistles to his\nfriends--mostly ladies of a tender age--and had incidentally acquired a\nreputation in the Old Country for his brilliant powers of narrative.\n\nThis, Hamilton discovered quite by accident. It would appear that\nHamilton's sister had been on a visit--was in fact on the visit when she\nwrote one letter which so opened Hamilton's eyes--and mentioned that she\nwas staying with some great friends of Bones'. She did not, of course,\ncall him \"Bones,\" but \"Mr. Tibbetts.\"\n\n\"I should awfully like to meet him,\" she wrote, \"he must be a very\ninteresting man. Aggie Vernon had a letter from him yesterday wherein he\ndescribed his awful experience lion-hunting.\n\n\"To be chased by a lion and caught and then carried to the beast's lair\nmust have been awful!\n\n\"Mr. Tibbetts is very modest about it in his letter, and beyond telling\nAggie that he escaped by sticking his finger in the lion's eye he says\nlittle of his subsequent adventure. By the way, Pat, Aggie tells me that\nyou had a bad bout of fever and that Mr. Tibbetts carried you for some\nmiles to the nearest doctor. I wish you wouldn't keep these things so\nsecret, it worries me dreadfully unless you tell me--even the worst\nabout yourself. I hope your interesting friend returned safely from his\ndangerous expedition into the interior--he was on the point of leaving\nwhen his letter was dispatched and was quite gloomy about his\nprospects....\"\n\nHamilton read this epistle over and over again, then he sent for Bones.\n\nThat gentleman came most cheerfully, full of fine animal spirits,\nand----\n\n\"Just had a letter about you, Bones,\" said Hamilton carelessly.\n\n\"About me, sir!\" said Bones; \"from the War Office--I'm not being\ndecorated or anything!\" he asked anxiously.\n\n\"No--nothing so tragic; it was a letter from my sister, who is staying\nwith the Vernons.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Bones going suddenly red.\n\n\"What a modest devil you are,\" said the admiring Hamilton, \"having a\nlion hunt all to yourself and not saying a word about it to anybody.\"\n\nBones made curious apologetic noises.\n\n\"I didn't know there were any lions in the country,\" pursued Hamilton\nremorselessly. \"Liars, yes! But lions, no! I suppose you brought them\nwith you--and I suppose you know also, Bones, that it is considered in\nlion-hunting circles awfully rude to stick your finger into a lion's\neye? It is bad sportsmanship to say the least, and frightfully painful\nfor the lion.\"\n\nBones was making distressful grimaces.\n\n\"How would you like a lion to stick his finger in _your_ eye?\" asked\nHamilton severely; \"and, by the way, Bones, I have to thank you.\"\n\nHe rose solemnly, took the hand of his reluctant and embarrassed second\nand wrung.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Hamilton, in a broken voice, \"for saving my life.\"\n\n\"Oh, I say, sir,\" began Bones feebly.\n\n\"To carry a man eighty miles on your back is no mean accomplishment,\nBones--especially when I was unconscious----\"\n\n\"I don't say you were unconscious, sir. In fact, sir----\" floundered\nLieutenant Tibbetts as red as a peony.\n\n\"And yet I was unconscious,\" insisted Hamilton firmly. \"I am still\nunconscious, even to this day. I have no recollection of your heroic\neffort, Bones, I thank you.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said Bones, \"to make a clean breast of the whole\naffair----\"\n\n\"And this dangerous expedition of yours, Bones, an expedition from which\nyou might never return--that,\" said Hamilton in a hushed voice, \"is the\nbest story I have heard for years.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Bones, speaking under the stress of considerable emotion, \"I\nam clean bowled, sir. The light-hearted fairy stories which I wrote to\ncheer, so to speak, the sick-bed of an innocent child, sir, they have\nrecoiled upon my own head. _Peccavi, mea culpi_, an' all those jolly old\nexpressions that you'll find in the back pages of the dictionary.\"\n\n\"Oh, Bones, Bones!\" chuckled Hamilton.\n\n\"You mustn't think I'm a perfect liar, sir,\" began Bones, earnestly.\n\n\"I don't think you're a perfect liar,\" answered Hamilton, \"I think\nyou're the most inefficient liar I've ever met.\"\n\n\"Not even a liar, I'm a romancist, sir,\" Bones stiffened with dignity\nand saluted, but whether he was saluting Hamilton, or the spirit of\nRomance, or in sheer admiration was saluting himself, Hamilton did not\nknow.\n\n\"The fact is, sir,\" said Bones confidentially, \"I'm writing a book!\"\n\nHe stepped back as though to better observe the effect of his words.\n\n\"What about?\" asked Hamilton, curiously.\n\n\"About things I've seen and things I know,\" said Bones, in his most\nimpressive manner.\n\n\"Oh, I see!\" said Hamilton, \"one of those waistcoat pocket books.\"\n\nBones swallowed the insult with a gulp.\n\n\"I've been asked to write a book,\" he said; \"my adventures an' all that\nsort of thing. Of course they needn't have happened, really----\"\n\n\"In that case, Bones, I'm with you,\" said Hamilton; \"if you're going to\nwrite a book about things that haven't happened to you, there's no limit\nto its size.\"\n\n\"You're bein' a jolly cruel old officer, sir,\" said Bones, pained by the\ncold cynicism of his chief. \"But I'm very serious, sir. This country is\nfull of material. And everybody says I ought to write a book about\nit--why, dash it, sir, I've been here nearly two months!\"\n\n\"It seems years,\" said Hamilton.\n\nBones was perfectly serious, as he had said. He did intend preparing a\nbook for publication, had dreams of a great literary career, and an\nultimate membership of the Athen\u00e6um Club belike. It had come upon him\nlike a revelation that such a career called him. The week after he had\ndefinitely made up his mind to utilize his gifts in this direction, his\noutgoing mail was heavier than ever. For to three and twenty English and\nAmerican publishers, whose names he culled from a handy work of\nreference, he advanced a business-like offer to prepare for the press a\nvolume \"of 316 pages printed in type about the same size as enclosed,\"\nand to be entitled:\n\n          MY WILD LIFE AMONGST CANNIBALS.\n\n                    BY\n\n     AUGUSTUS TIBBETTS, Lieutenant of Houssas.\n\n     Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society; Fellow of the Royal\n     Asiatic Society; Member of the Ethnological Society and Junior Army\n     Service Club.\n\nBones had none of these qualifications, save the latter, but as he told\nhimself he'd jolly soon be made a member if his book was a howling\nsuccess.\n\nNo sooner had his letters been posted than he changed his mind, and he\naddressed three and twenty more letters to the publishers, altering the\ntitle to:\n\n          THE TYRANNY OF THE WILDS.\n\n     Being Some Observations on the Habits and Customs\n            of Savage Peoples.\n\n                    BY\n\n     AUGUSTUS TIBBETTS (LT.).\n\n     With a Foreword by Captain Patrick Hamilton.\n\n\"You wouldn't mind writing a foreword, dear old fellow?\" he asked.\n\n\"Charmed,\" said Hamilton. \"Have you a particular preference for any\nform?\"\n\n\"Just please yourself, sir,\" said a delighted Bones, so Hamilton covered\ntwo sheets of foolscap with an appreciation which began:\n\n\"The audacity of the author of this singularly uninformed work is to be\nadmired without necessarily being imitated. Two months' residence in a\nland which offered many opportunities for acquiring inaccurate data, has\nresulted in a work which must stand for all time as a monument of\nmurderous effort,\" etc.\n\nBones read the appreciation very carefully.\n\n\"Dear old sport,\" he said, a little troubled, as he reached the end;\n\"this is almost uncomplimentary.\"\n\nYou couldn't depress Bones or turn him from his set purpose. He scribed\naway, occupying his leisure moments with his great work. His normal\ncorrespondence suffered cruelly, but Bones was relentless. Hamilton sent\nhim north to collect the hut tax, and at first Bones resented this\norder, believing that it was specially designed to hamper him.\n\n\"Of course, sir,\" he said, \"I'll obey you, if you order me in accordance\nwith regulations an' all that sort of rot, but believe me, sir, you're\ndoin' an injury to literature. Unborn generations, sir, will demand an\nexplanation----\"\n\n\"Get out!\" said Hamilton crossly.\n\nBones found his trip a blessing that had been well disguised. There were\nmany points of interest on which he required first-hand information. He\ncarried with him to the _Zaire_ large exercise books on which he had\npasted such pregnant labels as \"Native Customs,\" \"Dances,\" \"Ju-jus,\"\n\"Ancient Legends,\" \"Folk-lore,\" etc. They were mostly blank, and\nrepresented projected chapters of his great work.\n\nAll might have been well with Bones. More virgin pages might easily have\nbeen covered with his sprawling writing and the book itself, converted\ninto honest print, have found its way, in the course of time, into the\ntuppenny boxes of the Farringdon book-mart, sharing its soiled\nmagnificence with the work of the best of us, but on his way Bones had a\nbrilliant inspiration. There was a chapter he had not thought of, a\nchapter heading which had not been born to his mind until that flashing\nmoment of genius.\n\nUpon yet another exercise book, he pasted the label of a chapter which\nwas to eclipse all others in interest. Behold then, this enticing\nannouncement, boldly printed and ruled about with double lines:\n\n     \"THE SOUL OF THE NATIVE WOMAN.\"\n\nIt was a fine chapter title. It was sonorous, it had dignity, it was\nfull of possibilities. \"The Soul of the Native Woman,\" repeated Bones,\nin an ecstasy of self-admiration, and having chosen his subject he\nproceeded to find out something about it.\n\nNow, about this time, Bosambo of the Ochori might, had he wished and had\nhe the literary quality, have written many books about women, if for no\nother reason than because of a certain girl named D'riti.\n\nShe was a woman of fifteen, grown to a splendid figure, with a proud\nhead and a chin that tilted in contempt, for she was the daughter of\nBosambo's chief counsellor, grand-daughter of an Ochori king, and\nambitious to be wife of Bosambo himself.\n\n\"This is a mad thing,\" said Bosambo when her father offered the\nsuggestion; \"for, as you know, T'meli, I have one wife who is a thousand\nwives to me.\"\n\n\"Lord, I will be ten thousand,\" said D'riti, present at the interview\nand bold; \"also, Lord, it was predicted at my birth that I should marry\na king and the greater than a king.\"\n\n\"That is me,\" said Bosambo, who was without modesty; \"yet, it cannot\nbe.\"\n\nSo they married D'riti to a chief's son who beat her till one day she\nbroke his thick head with an iron pot, whereupon he sent her back to her\nfather demanding the return of his dowry and the value of his pot.\n\nShe had her following, for she was a dancer of fame and could twist her\nlithe body into enticing shapes. She might have married again, but she\nwas so scornful of common men that none dare ask for her. Also the\nincident of the iron pot was not forgotten, and D'riti went swaying\nthrough the village--she walked from her hips, gracefully--a straight,\nbrown, girl-woman desired and unasked.\n\nFor she knew men too well to inspire confidence in them. By some weird\nintuition which certain women of all races acquire, she had probed\nbehind their minds and saw with their eyes, and when she spoke of men,\nshe spoke with a conscious authority, and such men, who were within\nearshot of her vitriolic comments, squirmed uncomfortably, and called\nher a woman of shame.\n\nSo matters stood when the _Zaire_ came flashing to the Ochori city and\nthe heart of Bones filled with pleasant anticipation.\n\nWho was so competent to inform him on the matter of the souls of native\nwomen as Bosambo of the Ochori, already a crony of Bones, and admirable,\nif for no other reason, because he professed an open reverence for his\nnew master? At any rate, after the haggle of tax collection was\nfinished, Bones set about his task.\n\n\"Bosambo,\" said he, \"men say you are very wise. Now tell me something\nabout the women of the Ochori.\"\n\nBosambo looked at Bones a little startled.\n\n\"Lord,\" said he, \"who knows about women? For is it not written in the\nblessed Sura of the Djin that women and death are beyond\nunderstanding?\"\n\n\"That may be true,\" said Bones, \"yet, behold, I make a book full of wise\nand wonderful things and it would be neither wise nor wonderful if there\nwas no word of women.\"\n\nAnd he explained very seriously indeed that he desired to know of the\nsoul of native womanhood, of her thoughts and her dreams and her high\ndesires.\n\n\"Lord,\" said Bosambo, after a long thought, \"go to your ship: presently\nI will send to you a girl who thinks and speaks with great wisdom--and\nif she talks with you, you shall learn more things than I can tell you.\"\n\nTo the _Zaire_ at sundown came D'riti, a girl of proper height, hollow\nbacked, bare to the waist, with a thin skirting of fine silk cloth which\nher father had brought from the Coast, wound tightly about her, yet not\nso tightly that it hampered her swaying, lazy walk. She stood before a\ndisconcerted Bones, one small hand resting on her hip, her chin (as\nusual) tilted down at him from under lashes uncommonly long for a\nnative.\n\nAlso, this Bones saw, she was gifted with more delicate features than\nthe native woman can boast as a rule. The nose was straight and narrow,\nthe lips full, yet not of the negroid type. She was in fact a pure\nOchori woman, and the Ochori are related dimly to the Arabi tribes.\n\n\"Lord, Bosambo the King has sent me to speak about women,\" she said\nsimply.\n\n\"Doocidly awkward,\" said Bones to himself, and blushed.\n\n\"O, D'riti,\" he stammered, \"it is true I wish to speak of women, for I\nmake a book that all white lords will read.\"\n\n\"Therefore have I come,\" she said. \"Now listen, O my lord, whilst I tell\nyou of women, and of all they think, of their love for men and of the\nstrange way they show it. Also of children----\"\n\n\"Look here,\" said Bones, loudly. \"I don't want any--any--private\ninformation, my child----\"\n\nThen realizing from her frown that she did not understand him, he\nreturned to Bomongo.\n\n\"Lord, I will say what is to be said,\" she remarked, meekly, \"for you\nhave a gentle face and I see that your heart is very pure.\"\n\nThen she began, and Bones listened with open mouth ... later he was to\nfeel his hair rise and was to utter gurgling protests, for she spoke\nwith primitive simplicity about things that are never spoken about at\nall. He tried to check her, but she was not to be checked.\n\n\"Goodness, gracious heavens!\" gasped Bones.\n\nShe told him of what women think of men, and of what men _think_ women\nthink of them, and there was a remarkable discrepancy if she spoke the\ntruth. He asked her if she was married.\n\n\"Lord,\" she said at last, eyeing him thoughtfully, \"it is written that I\nshall marry one who is greater than chiefs.\"\n\n\"I'll bet you will, too,\" thought Bones, sweating.\n\nAt parting she took his hand and pressed it to her cheek.\n\n\"Lord,\" she said, softly, \"to-morrow when the sun is nearly down, I will\ncome again and tell you more....\"\n\nBones left before daybreak, having all the material he wanted for his\nbook and more.\n\nHe took his time descending the river, calling at sundry places.\n\nAt Ikan he tied up the _Zaire_ for the night, and whilst his men were\ncarrying the wood aboard, he settled himself to put down the gist of his\ndiscoveries. In the midst of his labours came Abiboo.\n\n\"Lord,\" said he, \"there has just come by a fast canoe the woman who\nspoke with you last night.\"\n\n\"Jumping Moses!\" said Bones, turning pale, \"say to this woman that I am\ngone----\"\n\nBut the woman came round the corner of the deck-house, shyly, yet with a\ncertain confidence.\n\n\"Lord,\" she said, \"behold I am here, your poor slave; there are\nwonderful things about women which I have not told you----\"\n\n\"O, D'riti!\" said Bones in despair, \"I know all things, and it is not\nlawful that you should follow me so far from your home lest evil be said\nof you.\"\n\nHe sent her to the hut of the chief's wife--M'lini-fo-bini of Ikan--with\ninstructions that she was to be returned to her home on the following\nmorning. Then he went back to his work, but found it strangely\ndistasteful. He left nothing to chance the next day.\n\nWith the dawn he slipped down the river at full speed, never so much as\nhalting till day began to fail, and he was a short day's journey from\nheadquarters.\n\n\"Anyhow, the poor dear won't overtake me to-day,\" he said--only to find\nthe \"poor dear\" had stowed herself away on the steamer in the night\nbehind a pile of wood.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It's very awkward,\" said Hamilton, and coughed.\n\nBones looked at his chief pathetically.\n\n\"It's doocid awkward, sir,\" he agreed dismally.\n\n\"You say she won't go back?\"\n\nBones shook his head.\n\n\"She said I'm the moon and the sun an' all sorts of rotten things to\nher, sir,\" he groaned and wiped his forehead.\n\n\"Send her to me,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"Be kind to her, sir,\" pleaded the miserable Bones. \"After all, sir, the\npoor girl seems to be fond of me, sir--the human heart, sir--I don't\nknow why she should take a fancy to me.\"\n\n\"That's what I want to know,\" said Hamilton, briefly; \"if she _is_ mad,\nI'll send her to the mission hospital along the Coast.\"\n\n\"You've a hard and bitter heart,\" said Bones, sadly.\n\nD'riti came ready to flash her anger and eloquence at Hamilton; on the\nverge of defiance.\n\n\"D'riti,\" said Hamilton, \"to-morrow I send you back to your people.\"\n\n\"Lord, I stay with Tibbetti who loves women and is happy to talk of\nthem. Also some day I shall be his wife, for this is foretold.\" She shot\na tender glance at poor Bones.\n\n\"That cannot be,\" said Hamilton calmly, \"for Tibbetti has three wives,\nand they are old and fierce----\"\n\n\"Oh, lord!\" wailed Bones.\n\n\"And they would beat you and make you carry wood and water,\" Hamilton\nsaid; he saw the look of apprehension steal into the girl's face. \"And\nmore than this, D'riti, the Lord Tibbetti is mad when the moon is in\nfull, he foams at the mouth and bites, uttering awful noises.\"\n\n\"Oh, dirty trick!\" almost sobbed Bones.\n\n\"Go, therefore, D'riti,\" said Hamilton, \"and I will give you a piece of\nfine cloth, and beads of many colours.\"\n\nIt is a matter of history that D'riti went.\n\n\"I don't know what you think of me, sir,\" said Bones, humbly, \"of course\nI couldn't get rid of her----\"\n\n\"You didn't try,\" said Hamilton, searching his pockets for his pipe.\n\"You could have made her drop you like a shot.\"\n\n\"How, sir?\"\n\n\"Stuck your finger in her eye,\" said Hamilton, and Bones swallowed hard.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTHE STRANGER WHO WALKED BY NIGHT\n\n\nSince the day when Lieutenant Francis Augustus Tibbetts rescued from the\nsacrificial trees the small brown baby whom he afterwards christened\nHenry Hamilton Bones, the interests of that young officer were to a very\nlarge extent extremely concentrated upon that absorbing problem which a\nfamous journal once popularized, \"What shall we do with our boys?\"\n\nAs to the exact nature of the communications which Bones made to England\nupon the subject, what hairbreadth escapes and desperate adventure he\ndetailed with that facile pen of his, who shall say?\n\nIt is unfortunate that Hamilton's sister--that innocent purveyor of home\nnews--had no glimpse of the correspondence, and that other recipients of\nhis confidence are not in touch with the writer of these chronicles.\nWhatever he wrote, with what fervour he described his wanderings in the\nforest no one knows, but certainly he wrote to some purpose.\n\n\"What the dickens are all these parcels that have come for you for?\"\ndemanded his superior officer, eyeing with disfavour a mountain of\nbrown paper packages be-sealed, be-stringed, and be-stamped.\n\nBones, smoking his pipe, turned them over.\n\n\"I don't know for certain,\" he said, carefully; \"but I shouldn't be\nsurprised if they aren't clothes, dear old officer.\"\n\n\"Clothes?\"\n\n\"For Henry,\" explained Bones, and cutting the string of one and tearing\naway its covering revealed a little mountain of snowy garments. Bones\nturned them over one by one.\n\n\"For Henry,\" he repeated; \"could you tell me, sir, what these things are\nfor?\"\n\nHe held up a garment white and small and frilly.\n\n\"No, sir, I can't,\" said Hamilton stiffly, \"unless like the ass that you\nare you have forgotten to mention to your friends that Henry is a\ngentleman child.\"\n\nBones looked up at the blue sky and scratched his chin.\n\n\"I may have called him 'her,'\" he confessed.\n\nThere were, to be exact, sixteen parcels and each contained at least one\nsuch garment, and in addition a very warm shawl, \"which,\" said Hamilton,\n\"will be immensely useful when it snows.\"\n\nWith the aid of his orderly, Bones sorted out the wardrobe and the\nplaythings (including many volumes of the\nOh-look-at-the-rat-on-the-mat-where-is-the-cat? variety), and these he\ncarried to his hut with such dignity as he could summon.\n\nThat evening, Hamilton paid his subordinate a visit. Henry, pleasingly\narrayed in a pair of the misdirected garments with a large bonnet on his\nhead, and seated on the floor of the quarters contentedly chewing Bones'\nwatch, whilst Bones, accompanying himself with his banjo, was singing a\nsong which was chiefly remarkable for the fact that he was ignorant of\nthe tune and somewhat hazy concerning the words.\n\n     \"Did you ever take a tum-ty up the Nile,\n     Did you ever dumpty dupty in a camp,\n     Or dumpty dumpty on m--m----\n     Or play it in a dumpty dumpty swamp.\"\n\nHe rose, and saluted his senior, as Hamilton came in.\n\n\"Exactly what is going to happen when Sanders comes back?\" asked\nHamilton, and the face of Bones fell.\n\n\"Happen, sir? I don't take you, sir--what _could_ happen--to whom, sir?\"\n\n\"To Henry,\" said Hamilton.\n\nHenry looked up at that moment with a seraphic smile.\n\n\"Isn't he wonderful, sir?\" asked Bones in hushed ecstasy; \"you won't\nbelieve what I'm going to tell you, sir--you're such a jolly old\nsceptic, sir--but Henry knows me--positively recognizes me! And when you\nremember that he's only four months old--why, it's unbelievable.\"\n\n\"But what will you do when Sanders comes--really, Bones, I don't know\nwhether I ought to allow this as it is.\"\n\n\"If exception is taken to Henry, sir,\" said Bones firmly, \"I resign my\ncommission; if a gentleman is allowed to keep a dog, sir, he is surely\nallowed to keep a baby. Between Henry and me, sir, there is a bond\nstronger than steel. I may be an ass, sir, I may even be a goop, but\ncome between me an' my child an' all my motherly instincts--if you'll\npardon the paradox--all my paternal--that's the word--instincts are\naroused, and I will fight like a tiger, sir----\"\n\n\"What a devil you are for jaw,\" said Hamilton; \"anyway, I've warned you.\nSanders is due in a month.\"\n\n\"Henry will be five,\" murmured Bones.\n\n\"Oh, blow Henry!\" said Hamilton.\n\nBones rose and pointed to the door.\n\n\"May I ask you, sir,\" he said, \"not to use that language before the\nchild? I hate to speak to you like this, sir, but I have a\nresponsible----\"\n\nHe dodged out of the open door and the loaf of bread which Hamilton had\nthrown struck the lintel and rolled back to Henry's eager hands.\n\nThe two men walked up and down the parade ground whilst Fa'ma, the wife\nof Ahmet, carried the child to her quarters where he slept.\n\n\"I'm afraid I've got to separate you from your child,\" said Hamilton;\n\"there is some curious business going on in the Lombobo, and a stranger\nwho walks by night, of which Ahmet the Spy writes somewhat\nconfusingly.\"\n\nBones glanced round in some apprehension.\n\n\"Oblige me, old friend,\" he entreated, \"by never speakin' of such things\nbefore Henry--I wouldn't have him scared for the world.\"\n\n\nII\n\nBosambo of the Ochori was a light sleeper, the lighter because of\ncertain stories which had reached him of a stranger who walks by night,\nand in the middle of the night he suddenly became wide awake, conscious\nthat there was a man in his hut of whose coming the sentry without was\nignorant.\n\nBosambo's hand went out stealthily for his short spear, but before he\ncould reach it, his wrist was caught in a grip of steel, strong fingers\ngripped his throat, and the intruder whispered fiercely, using certain\nwords which left the chief helpless with wonder.\n\n\"I am M'gani of the Night,\" said the voice with authoritative hauteur,\n\"of me you have heard, for I am known only to chiefs; and am so high\nthat chiefs obey and even devils go quickly from my path.\"\n\n\"O, M'gani, I hear you,\" whispered Bosambo, \"how may I serve you?\"\n\n\"Get me food,\" said the imperious stranger, \"after, you shall make a bed\nfor me in your inner room, and sit before this house that none may\ndisturb me, for it is to my high purpose that no word shall go to\nM'ilitani that I stay in your territory.\"\n\n\"M'gani, I am your dog,\" said Bosambo, and stole forth from the hut like\na thief to obey.\n\nAll that day he sat before his hut and even sent away the wife of his\nheart and the child M'sambo, that the rest of M'gani of the N'gombi\nshould not be disturbed.\n\nThat night when darkness had come and the glowing red of hut fires grew\ndimmer, M'gani came from the hut.\n\nBosambo had sent away the guard and accompanied his guest to the end of\nthe village.\n\nM'gani, with only a cloak of leopard skin about him, twirling two long\nspears as he walked, was silent till he came to the edge of the city\nwhere he was to take farewell of his host.\n\n\"Tell me this, Bosambo, where are Sandi's spies that I may avoid them?\"\n\nAnd Bosambo, without hesitation, told him.\n\n\"M'gani,\" said he, at parting, \"where do you go now? tell me that I may\nsend cunning men to guard you, for there is a bad spirit in this land,\nespecially amongst the people of Lombobo, because I have offended B'limi\nSaka, the chief.\"\n\n\"No soldiers do I need, O Bosambo,\" said the other. \"Yet I tell you this\nthat I go to quiet places to learn that which will be best for my\npeople.\"\n\nHe turned to go.\n\n\"M'gani,\" said Bosambo, \"in the day when you shall see our lord Sandi,\nspeak to him for me saying that I am faithful, for it seems to me, so\nhigh a man are you that he will listen to your word when he will listen\nto none other.\"\n\n\"I hear,\" said M'gani gravely, and slipped into the shadows of the\nforest.\n\nBosambo stood for a long time staring in the direction which M'gani had\ntaken, then walked slowly back to his hut.\n\nIn the morning came the chief of his councillors for a hut palaver.\n\n\"Bosambo,\" said he, in a tone of mystery, \"the Walker-of-the-Night has\nbeen with us.\"\n\n\"Who says this?\" asked Bosambo.\n\n\"Fibini, the fisherman,\" said the councillor, \"for this he says, that\nhaving toothache, he sat in the shadow of his hut near the warm fire and\nsaw the Walker pass through the village and with him, lord, one who was\nlike a devil, being big and very ugly.\"\n\n\"Go to Fibini,\" said a justly annoyed Bosambo, \"and beat him on the feet\ntill he cries--for he is a liar and a spreader of alarm.\"\n\nYet Fibini had done his worst before the bastinado (an innovation of\nBosambo's) had performed its silencing mission, and Ochori mothers\nshepherded their little flocks with greater care when the sun went down\nthat night, for this new terror which had come to the land, this black\nghost with the wildfire fame was reputed especially devilish. In a week\nhe had become famous--so swift does news carry in the territories.\n\nMen had seen him passing through forest paths, or speeding with\nincredible swiftness along the silent river. Some said that he had no\nboat and walked the waters, others that he flew like a bat with millions\nof bats behind him. One had met him face to face and had sunk to the\nground before eyes \"that were very hot and red and thrusting out little\nlightnings.\"\n\nHe had been seen in many places in the Ochori, in the N'gombi city, in\nthe villages of the Akasava, but mainly his hunting ground was the\nnarrow strip of territory which is called Lombobo.\n\nB'limi Saka, the chief of the land, himself a believer in devils, was\nespecially perturbed lest the Silent Walker should be a spy of\nGovernment, for he had been guilty of practices which were particularly\nobnoxious to the white men who were so swift to punish.\n\n\"Yet,\" said he to his daughter and (to the disgust of his people, who\ndespised women) his chief councillor, \"none know my heart save you,\nLamalana.\"\n\nLamalana, with her man shoulders and her flat face, peered at her\ngrizzled father sideways.\n\n\"Devils hear hearts,\" she said huskily, \"and when they talk of killings\nand sacrifices are not all devils pleased? Now I tell you this, my\nfather, that I wait for sacrifices which you swore by death you would\nshow me.\"\n\nB'limi Saka looked round fearfully. Though the ferocity of this chief\nwas afterwards revealed, though secret places in the forest held his\nhorrible secret killing-houses, yet he was a timid man with a certain\naffection of his eyes which made him dependent upon the childless widow\nwho had been his strength for two years.\n\nThe Lombobo were the cruellest of Sanders' people; their chiefs the most\ntreacherous. Neither akin to the N'gombi, the Isisi, the Akasava nor the\nOchori, they took on the worst attributes of each race.\n\nSeldom in open warfare did they challenge the Administration, but there\nwas a long tale of slain and mutilated enemies who floated face\ndownwards in the stream; of disappearance of faithful servants of\nGovernment, and of acts of cannibalism which went unidentified and\nunpunished.\n\nFor though all the tribes, save the Ochori, had been cannibals, yet by\nfire and rope, tempered with wisdom, had the Administration brought\nabout a newer era to the upper river.\n\nBut reformation came not to the Lombobo. A word from Sanders, a\ncarelessly expressed view, and the Lombobo people would have been swept\nfrom existence--wiped ruthlessly from the list of nations, but that was\nnot the way of Government, which is patient and patient and patient\nagain till in the end, by sheer heavy weight of patience, it crushes\nopposition to its wishes.\n\nThey called Lamalana the barren woman, the Drinker of Life, but she had\nat least drunken without ostentation, and if she murdered with her own\nlarge hands, or staked men and women from a sheer lust of cruelty, there\nwere none alive to speak against her.\n\nOutside the town of Lombobo[6] was a patch of beaten ground where no\ngrass grew, and this place was called \"wa boma,\" the killing ground.\n\n[Footnote 6: The territories are invariably named after the principal\ncity, which is sometimes, perhaps, a little misleading.--E. W.]\n\nHere, before the white men came, sacrifices were made openly, and it was\nperhaps for this association and because it was, from its very openness,\nfree from the danger of the eavesdropper, that Lamalana and her father\nwould sit by the hour, whilst he told her the story of ancient\nhorrors--never too horrible for the woman who swayed to and fro as she\nlistened as one who was hypnotized.\n\n\"Lord,\" said she, \"the Walker of the Night comes not alone to the\nLombobo; all people up and down the river have seen him, and to my mind\nhe is a sign of great fortune showing that ghosts are with us. Now, if\nyou are very brave, we will have a killing greater than any. Is there no\nhole in the hill[7] which Bosambo dug for your shame? And, lord, do not\nthe people of the Ochori say that this child M'sambo is the light of his\nfather's life? O ko! Bosambo shall be sorry.\"\n\n[Footnote 7: _See_ \"The Right of Way.\"]\n\nLater they walked in the forest speaking, for they had no fear of the\nspirits which the last slanting rays of the dying sun unlocked from the\ntrees. And they talked and walked, and Lombobo huntsmen, returning\nthrough the wood, gave them a wide berth, for Lamalana was possessed of\nan eye which was notoriously evil.\n\n\"Let us go back to the city,\" said Lamalana, \"for now I see that you are\nvery brave and not a blind old man.\"\n\n\"There will be a great palaver and who knows but M'ilitani will come\nwith his soldiers?\"\n\nShe laughed loudly and hoarsely, making the silent forest ring with\nharsh noise.\n\n\"O ko!\" she said, then laughed no more.\n\nIn the centre of the path was a man; in the half light she saw the\nleopard skin and the strange belt of metal about his waist.\n\n\"O Lamalana,\" he said softly, \"laugh gently, for I have quick ears and I\nsmell blood.\"\n\nHe pointed to the darkening forest path down which they had come.\n\n\"Many have been sacrificed and none heard them,\" he said, \"this I know\nnow. Let there be an end to killing, for I am M'gani, the Walker of the\nNight, and very terrible.\"\n\n\"Wa!\" screamed Lamalana, and leapt at him with clawing hands and her\nwhite teeth agrin. Then something soft and damp struck her face--full in\nthe mouth like a spray of water, and she fell over struggling for her\nbreath, and rose gasping to her feet to find the Walker had gone.\n\n\nIII\n\nBefore Bosambo's hut Bones sat in a long and earnest conversation, and\nthe subject of his discourse was children. For, alarmed by the ominous\nsuggestion which Bones had put forward, that his superior should be\nresponsible for the well-being of Henry in the absence of his\nfoster-parent, Hamilton had yielded to the request that Henry should\naccompany Bones on his visit to the north.\n\nAnd now, on a large rug before Bosambo and his lord, there sat two small\nchildren eyeing one another with mutual distrust.\n\n\"Lord,\" said Bosambo, \"it is true that your lordship's child is\nwonderful, but I think that M'sambo is also wonderful. If your lordship\nwill look with kind eyes he will see a certain cunning way which is\nstrange in so young a one. Also he speaks clearly so that I understand\nhim.\"\n\n\"Yet,\" contested Bones, \"as it seems to me, Bosambo, mine is very wise,\nfor see how he looks to me when I speak, raising his thumb.\"\n\nBones made a clucking noise with his mouth, and Henry turned frowningly,\nregarded his protector with cool indifference, and returned to his\nscrutiny of the other strange brown animal confronting him.\n\n\"Now,\" said Bones that night, \"what of the Walker?\"\n\n\"Lord, I know of him,\" said Bosambo, \"yet I cannot speak for we are\nblood brothers by certain magic rites and speeches; this I know, that he\nis a good man as I shall testify to Sandi when he comes back to his own\npeople.\"\n\n\"You sit here for Government,\" said Bones, \"and if you don't play the\ngame you're a jolly old rotter, Bosambo!\"\n\n\"I know 'um, I no speak 'um, sah,\" said Bosambo, \"I be good fellah, sah,\nno Yadasi fellah, sah--I be Peter feller, cut 'em ear some like, sah!\"\n\n\"You're a naughty old humbug,\" said Bones, and went to bed on the\n_Zaire_ leaving Henry with the chief's wife....\n\nIn the dark hours before the dawn he led his Houssas across the beach,\nrevolver in hand, but came a little too late. The surprise party had\nbeen well planned. A speared sentry lay twisting before the chief's hut,\nand Bosambo's face was smothered in blood. Bones took in the situation.\n\n\"Fire on the men who fly to the forest,\" he said, but Bosambo laid a\nshaking hand upon his arm.\n\n\"Lord,\" he said, \"hold your fire, for they have taken the children, and\nI fear the woman my wife is stricken.\"\n\nHe went into the hut, Bones following.\n\nThe chief's wife had a larger hut than Bosambo's own, communicating with\nher lord's through a passage of wicker and clay, and the raiders had\nclubbed her to silence, but Bones knew enough of surgery to see that she\nwas in no danger.\n\nIn ten minutes the fighting regiments of the Ochori were sweeping\nthrough the forest, trackers going ahead to pick up the trail.\n\n\"Let all gods hear me,\" sobbed Bosambo, as he ran, \"and send M'gani\nswiftly to M'sambo my son.\"\n\n\nIV\n\n\"Now this is very wonderful,\" said Lamalana, \"and it seems, O my father,\nno matter for a small killing, but for a sacrifice such as all men may\nsee.\"\n\nIt was the hour following the dawn when the world was at its sweetest,\nwhen the chattering weaver birds went in and out of their hanging nests\ngossiping loudly, and faint perfumes from little morning flowers gave\nthe air an unusual delicacy.\n\nAll the Lombobo people, the warriors and the hunters, the wives and the\nmaidens, and even the children of tender years, lined the steep slopes\nof the Cup of Sacrifice. For Lamalana, deaf and blind to reason, knew\nthat her hour was short, and that with the sun would come a man terrible\nin his anger ... and the soldiers who eat up opposition with fire.\n\n\"O people!\" she cried.\n\nShe was stripped to the waist, stood behind the Stone of Death as though\nit were a counter, and the two squirming infants under her hands were so\nmuch saleable stock: \"Here we bring terror to all who hate us, for one\nof these is the heart of Bosambo and the other is more than the heart of\nthe-man-who-stands-for-Sandi----\"\n\n\"O woman!\"\n\nThe intruder had passed unnoticed, almost it seemed by magic, through\nthe throng, and now he stood in the clear space of sacrifice. And there\nwas not one in the throng who had not heard of him with his leopard skin\nand his belt of brass.\n\nHe was as black as the strange Ethiopians who came sometimes to the land\nwith the Arabi traders, his muscular arms and legs were dull in their\nblackness.\n\nThere was a whisper of terror--\"The Walker of the Night!--\" and the\npeople fell back ... a woman screamed and fell into a fit.\n\n\"O woman,\" said M'gani, \"deliver to me these little children who have\ndone no evil.\"\n\nOpen-mouthed the half-demented daughter of B'limi Saka stared at him.\n\nHe walked forward, lifted the children in his two arms and went slowly\nthrough the people, who parted in terror at his coming.\n\nHe turned at the top of the basin to speak.\n\n\"Do no wickedness,\" said he; then he gently stooped to put the children\non the ground, for mouthing and bellowing senseless sounds Lamalana came\nfuriously after him, her long, crooked knife in her hand. He thrust his\nhand into the leopard skin as for a weapon, but before he could withdraw\nit, a man of Lombobo, half in terror, fell upon and threw his arms about\nM'gani.\n\n\"Bo'ma!\" boomed the woman, and drew back her knife for the stroke....\n\nBones, from the edge of the clearing, jerked up the rifle he carried and\nfired.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What man is this?\" asked Bones.\n\nBosambo looked at the stranger.\n\n\"This is M'gani,\" he said, \"he who walks in the night.\"\n\n\"The dooce it is!\" said Bones, and fixing his monocle glared at the\nstranger.\n\n\"From whence do you come?\" he asked.\n\n\"Lord, I come from the Coast,\" said the man, \"by many strange ways,\ndesiring to arrive at this land secretly that I might learn the heart of\nthese people and understand.\" Then, in perfect English, \"I don't think\nwe've ever met before, Mr. Tibbetts--my name is Sanders.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nA RIGHT OF WAY\n\n\nThe Borders of Territories may be fixed by treaty, by certain\nmathematical calculations, or by arbitrary proclamation. In the\nterritories over which Sanders ruled they were governed as between tribe\nand tribe by custom and such natural lines of demarkation as a river or\na creek supplied.\n\nIn forest land this was not possible, and there had ever been between\nthe Ochori and the Lombobo a feud and a grievance, touched-up border\nfights, for hereabouts there is good hunting. Sanders had tried many\nmethods and had hit upon the red gum border as a solution to a great\ndifficulty. For some curious reason there were no red gum trees in the\nnorthern fringe of the forest for five miles on the Ochori side of the\ngreat wood; it was innocent of this beautiful tree and Sanders' fiat had\ngone forth that there should be no Ochori hunting in the red gum lands,\nand that settled the matter and Sanders hoped for good.\n\nBut Bosambo set himself to enlarge his borders by a single expedient.\nWherever his hunters came upon a red gum tree they cut it down. B'limi\nSaka, the chief of the sullen Lombobo, retaliated by planting red gum\nsaplings on the country between the forest and the river--a fact of\nwhich Bosambo was not aware until he suddenly discovered a huge wedge of\nred gum driven into his lawful territory. A wedge so definite as to cut\noff nearly a thousand square miles of his territory, for beyond this\nborder lay the lower Ochori country.\n\n\"How may I reach my proper villages?\" he asked Sanders, who had known\nsomething of the comedy which was being enacted.\n\n\"You shall have canoes at the place of the young gum trees and shall row\nto a place beyond them,\" Sanders had said. \"I have given my word that\nthe red gum lands are the territory of B'limi Saka, and since you have\nonly your cunning to thank--Oh, cutter of trees--I cannot help you!\"\n\nBosambo would have made short work of the young saplings, but B'limisaka\nestablished a guard not to be forced without bloodshed, and Bosambo\ncould do no more in that way of reprisal than instruct his people to\nhurl insulting references to B'limisaka's as they passed the forbidden\nground.\n\nFor the maddening thing was that the slip of filched territory was less\nthan a hundred yards wide and men of the Lombobo, who went out by night\nto widen it, never came out alive--for Bosambo also had a guard.\n\nSometimes the minion spies of Government would come to headquarters\nwith a twist of rice paper stuck in a quill, the quill inserted in the\nlobes of the ear in very much the same place as the ladies wore their\nearrings in the barbarous mid-Victorian period, and on the rice paper\nwith the briefest introduction would be inserted, in perfect Arabic,\nscraps of domestic news for the information of the Government.\n\nSometimes news would carry from mouth to mouth and a weary man would\nsquat before Hamilton and recite his lesson.\n\n\"Efobi of the Isisi has stolen goats, and because he is the brother of\nthe chief's wife goes unpunished; T'mara of the Akasava has put a curse\nupon the wife of O'femo the headman, and she has burnt his hut; N'kema\nof the Ochori will not pay his tax, saying that he is no Ochori man, but\na true N'gombi; Bosambo's men have beaten a woodman of B'limi Saka,\nbecause he planted trees on Ochori land; the well folk are on the edge\nof the N'gomb forest, building huts and singing----\"\n\n\"How long do they stay?\" interrupted Hamilton.\n\n\"Lord, who knows?\" said the man.\n\n\"Ogibo of the Akasava has spoken evilly of his king and mightily of\nhimself----\"\n\n\"Make a note of that, Bones.\"\n\n\"Make a note of which, sir?\"\n\n\"Ogibo--he looked like a case of sleep-sickness the last time I was in\nhis village--go on.\"\n\n\"Ogibo also says that the father of his father was a great chief and was\nlord of all the Akasava----\"\n\n\"That's sleeping sickness all right,\" said Hamilton bitterly. \"Why the\ndevil doesn't he wait till Sanders is back before he goes mad?\"\n\n\"Drop him a line, sir,\" suggested Bones, \"he's a remarkable feller--dash\nit all, sir, what the dooce is the good of bein' in charge of the\ndistrict if you can't put a stop to that sort of thing?\"\n\n\"What talk is there of spears in this?\" asked Hamilton of the spy.\n\n\"Lord, much talk--as I know, for I serve in this district.\"\n\n\"Go swiftly to Ogibo, and summon him to me for a high _lakimbo_,[8]\"\nsaid Hamilton; \"my soldiers shall carry you in my new little ship that\nburns water[9]--fly pigeons to me that I may know all that happens.\"\n\n[Footnote 8: Palaver.]\n\n[Footnote 9: The motor-launch.]\n\n\"On my life,\" said the spy, raised his hand in salute and departed.\n\n\"These well people you were talkin' about, sir,\" asked Bones, \"who are\nthey?\"\n\nBut Hamilton could give no satisfactory answer to such a question, and,\nindeed, he would have been more than ordinarily clever had he been able\nto.\n\nThe wild territories are filled with stubborn facts, bewildering\nrealities, and extraordinary inconsequences. Up by the N'gombi lands\nlived a tribe who, for the purposes of office classification, were known\nas \"N'gombi (Interior),\" but who were neither N'gombi nor Isisi, nor of\nany known branch of the Bantu race, but known as \"the people of the\nwell.\" They had remarkable legends, sayings which they ascribed to a\nmythical Idoosi; also they have a song which runs:\n\n     O well in the forest!\n     Which chiefs have digged;\n     No common men touched the earth,\n     But chiefs' spears and the hands of kings.\n\nNow there is no doubt that both the sayings of Idoosi and the song of\nthe well have come down from days of antiquity, and that Idoosi is none\nother than the writer of the lost book of the Bible, of whom it is\nwritten:\n\n     \"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not\n     written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy\n     of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the vision of Idoo the\n     seer?\"[10]....\n\n[Footnote 10: Chronicles II., ix. 29.]\n\nAnd is not the Song of the Well identical with that brief extract from\nthe Book of Wars of the Lord--lost to us for ever--which runs:\n\n     \"Spring up, O well: sing ye unto it: The well, which the princes\n     digged, Which the nobles of the people delved, With the sceptre ...\n     with their staves.\"[11]\n\n[Footnote 11: Numbers xxi. 17.]\n\nSome men say that the People of the Well are one of the lost tribes, but\nthat is an easy solution which suggests itself to the hasty-minded.\nOthers say that they are descendants of the Babylonian races, or that\nthey came down from Egypt when Rameses II died, and there arose a new\ndynasty and a Pharaoh who did not know the wise Jewish Prime Minister\nwho ruled so wisely, who worshipped in the little temple at Karnac, and\nwhose statue you may see in Cairo with a strange Egyptian name. We know\nhim better as \"Joseph\"--he who was sold into captivity.\n\nWhatever they were, this much is known, to the discomfort of everybody,\nthat they were great diggers of wells, and would, on the slightest\nexcuse, spend whole months, choosing, for some mad reason, the top of\nhills for their operations, delving in the earth for water, though the\nriver was less than a hundred yards away.\n\nOf all the interesting solutions which have been offered with the object\nof identifying the People of the Well, none are so interesting as that\nwhich Bones put forward at the end of Hamilton's brief sketch.\n\n\"My idea, dear old officer,\" he said profoundly, \"that all these\nJohnnies are artful old niggers who've run away from their wives in\nTimbuctoo--and for this reason----\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up!\" said Hamilton.\n\nTwo nights later the bugles were ringing through the Houssa lines, and\nBones, sleepy-eyed, with an armful of personal belongings, was racing\nfor the _Zaire_, for Ogibo of the Akasava had secured a following.\n\n\nII\n\nThe chief Ogibo who held the law and kept the peace for his master, the\nKing of the Akasava, was bitten many times by the tsetse on a hunting\ntrip into the bad lands near the Utur forest. Two years afterwards, of a\nsudden, he was seized with a sense of his own importance, and proclaimed\nhimself paramount chief of the Akasava, and all the lands adjoining. And\nsince it is against nature that any lunatic should be without his\nfollowing, he had no difficulty in raising all the spears that were\nrequisite for his immediate purpose, marched to Igili, the second most\nimportant town in the Akasava kingdom, overthrew the defensive force,\ndestroyed the town, and leaving half his fighting regiment to hold the\nconquered city he moved through the forest toward the Akasava city\nproper. He camped in the forest, and his men spent an uncomfortable\nnight, for a thunderstorm broke over the river, and the dark was filled\nwith quick flashes and the heavens crashed noisily. There was still a\nrumbling and a growling above his head when he assembled his forces in\nthe grey dawn, and continued his march. He had not gone half an hour\nbefore one of his headmen came racing up to where he led his force in\nmajesty.\n\n\"Lord,\" said he, \"do you hear no sound?\"\n\n\"I hear the thunder,\" said Ogibo.\n\n\"Listen!\" said the headman.\n\nThey halted, head bent.\n\n\"It is thunder,\" said Ogibo, as the rumble and moan of the distant storm\ncame to him. Then above the grumble of the thunder came a sharper note,\na sound to be expressed in the word \"blong!\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said the headman, \"that is no thunder, rather is it the\nfire-thrower of M'ilitani.\"\n\nSo Ogibo in his wrath turned back to crush the insolent white men who\nhad dared attack the garrison he had left behind to hold Igili.\n\nBones with a small force was pursuing him, totally unaware of the\nstrength that Ogibo mustered. A spy brought to the chief news of the\nsmallness of the following force.\n\n\"Now,\" said Ogibo, \"I will show all the world how great a chief I am,\nfor my bravery I will destroy all these soldiers that are sent against\nme.\"\n\nHe chose his ambush well--though he had need to send scampering with\nsqueals of terror half a hundred humble aliens who were at the moment of\ninterruption digging a foolish well on the top of the hill where Ogibo\nwas concealing his shaking force.\n\nBones with his Houssas saw how the path led up a tolerably steep\nhill--one of the few in the country--and groaned aloud, for he hated\nhills.\n\nHe was half-way up at the head of his men, when Ogibo on the summit gave\nthe order, \"Boma!\" said he, which means kill, and three abreast, shields\nlocked and spears gripped stomach high, the rebels charged down the\npath. Bones saw them coming and slipped out his revolver. There was no\nroom to manoeuvre his men, the path was fairly narrow, dense\nundergrowth masked each side.\n\nHe heard the yell, saw above the bush, which concealed the winding way,\nthe dancing head-dresses of the attackers, and advanced his pistol arm.\nThe rustle of bare feet on the path, a louder roar than ever--then\nsilence.\n\nBones waited, a Houssa squeezed on either side of him, but the onrushing\nenemy did not appear, and only a faint whimper of sound reached him.\n\n\"Lord! they go back!\" gasped his sergeant; and Bones saw to his\namazement a little knot of men making their frantic way up the hill.\n\nAt first he suspected an ambush within an ambush, but it was unlikely;\nhe could never be more at Ogibo's mercy than he had been.\n\nCautiously he felt his way up the hill path, a revolver in each hand.\n\nHe rounded a sharp corner of the path and saw....\n\nA great square chasm yawned in the very centre of the pathway, the\nbushes on either side were buried under the earth which the diggers of\nwells had flung up, and piled one on the other, a writhing, struggling\nconfusion of shining bodies, were Ogibo's soldiers to the number of a\nhundred, with a silent Ogibo undermost, wholly indifferent to his\nembarrassing position, for his neck was broken.\n\nHamilton came up in the afternoon and brought villagers to assist at the\nwork of rescue and afterwards he interviewed the chief of the shy and\ntimid Well-folk.\n\n\"O chief,\" said Hamilton, \"it is an order of Sandi that you shall dig no\nwells near towns, and yet you have done this.\"\n\n\"Bless his old heart!\" murmured Bones.\n\n\"Lord, I break the law,\" said the man, simply, \"also I break all custom,\nfor to-day, by your favour, I cross the river, I and my people. This we\nhave never done since time was.\"\n\n\"Whither do you go?\"\n\nThe chief of the wanderers, an old man remarkably gifted--for his beard\nwas long and white, and reached to his waist--stuck his spear head down\nin the earth.\n\n\"Lord, we go to a place which is written,\" he said; \"for Idoosi has\nsaid, 'Go forth to the natives at war, they that fight by the river; on\nthe swift water shall you go, even against the water'--many times have\nwe come to the river, master, but ever have we turned back; but now it\nseems that the prophecy has been fulfilled, for there are bleeding men\nin these holes and the sound of thunders.\"\n\nThe People of the Well crossed to the Isisi, using the canoes of the\nAkasava headmen, and made a slow progress through territory which gave\nthem no opportunity of exercising their hobby, since water lay less than\na spade's length beneath the driest ground.\n\n\"Poor old Sanders,\" said Hamilton ruefully, when he was again on the\n_Zaire_, \"I've so mixed up his people that he'll have to get a new map\nmade to find them again.\"\n\n\"You might tell me off to show him round, sir,\" suggested Bones, but\nHamilton did not jump at the offer.\n\nHe was getting more than a little rattled. Sanders was due back in a\nmonth, and it seemed that scarcely a week passed but some complication\narose that further entangled a situation which was already too full of\nloose and straying threads for his liking.\n\n\"I suppose the country is settled for a week at any rate,\" he said with\na little sigh of relief--but he reckoned without his People of the Well.\n\nThey moved, a straggling body of men and women, with their stiff walk\nand their doleful song, a wild people with strange, pinched faces and\nlong black hair, along the river's edge.\n\nA week's journeyings brought them to the Ochori country and to Bosambo,\nwho was holding a most important palaver.\n\nIt was held on Ochori territory, for the forbidden strip was by this\ntime so thickly planted with young trees that there was no place for a\nman to sit.\n\n\"Lord,\" said Bosambo, \"if you will return me the land which you have\nstolen, so that I may pass unhindered from one part of my territory to\nthe other, I will give you many islands on the river.\"\n\n\"That is a foolish palaver,\" said B'limisaka; \"for you have no islands\nto give.\"\n\n\"Now I tell you, B'limisaka,\" said Bosambo, \"my young men are crying out\nagainst you, for, as you know, you have planted your trees on the high\nground, and my people, taking to their canoes, must climb down to the\nwater's edge a long way, so that it wearies their legs, soon, I fear, I\nshall not hold them, for they are very fierce and full of arrogance.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said B'limisaka, significantly, \"my young men are also fierce.\"\n\nThe palaver was dispersing, and the last of the Lombobo councillors were\ndisappearing in the forest, when the Diggers of the Well came through\nthe forbidden territory to the place where Bosambo sat.\n\n\"We are they of whom you have heard, O my Lord,\" said the old man, who\nled them, \"also we carry a book for you.\"\n\nHe unwound the cloth about his thin middle, and with many fumblings\nproduced a paper which Bosambo read.\n\n     \"From M'ilitani, by Ogibo's village in the Akasava.\n\n     \"To Bosambo--may God preserve him!\n\n     \"I give this to the chief of Well diggers that you shall know they\n     are favoured by me, being simple people and very timid. Give them a\n     passage through your territory, for they seek a holy land, and find\n     them high places for the digging of holes, for they seek truth. Now\n     peace on your house, Bosambo.\"\n\n     \"On my ship, by channel of rocks.\"\n\n\"Lord, it is true,\" said the old chief, \"we seek a shining thing that\nwill stay white when it is white, and black when it is black, and the\nwise Idoosi has said, 'Go down into the earth for truth, seek it in the\ndeeps of the earth, for it lies in secret places, in centre of the world\nit lies.'\"\n\nBosambo thought long and rapidly, then there came to him the bright\nlight of an inspiration.\n\n\"What manner of holes do you dig, old man?\"\n\n\"Lord, we dig them deep, for we are cunning workers, and do not fear\ndeath as common men do; also we dig them straightly--into the very heart\nof hills we dig them.\"\n\nBosambo looked at the sloping ground covered with hateful gum.\n\n\"Old man,\" said he softly, \"here shall you dig, you and your people, for\nin the heart of this hill is such a truth as you desire--my young men\nshall bring you food and build huts for you, and I will place one who is\ncunning in the way of hills to show you the way.\"\n\nThe old man's eyes gleamed joyously, and he clasped the ankles of his\nmagnanimous host.\n\n\"Lord,\" said he humbly, \"now is the prophecy fulfilled, for it was said\nby the great Idoosi, 'You shall come to a land where the barbarian\nrules, and he shall be to you as a brother!'\"\n\n\"Nigger,\" said Bosambo in his vile English--yet with a certain hauteur,\n\"you shall dig 'um tunnel--you no cheek 'um, no chat 'um, you lib for\ndear tunnel one time.\"\n\nHe watched them as, singing the song of the well, they went to work,\nwomen, men, and even little children undermining the Chief B'limisaka's\nterritory and creating for Bosambo the right of way for which his soul\ncraved.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE GREEN CROCODILE\n\n\n_Cala cala_, as they say, seven brothers lived near the creek of the\nGreen One. It was not called the creek of the Green One in those far-off\ndays, for the monstrous thing had no existence.\n\nAnd the seven brothers had seven wives who were sisters, and it would\nappear from the legend that these seven wives were unfaithful to their\nhusbands, and upon a certain night in the full of the moon, the brothers\nreturning from an expedition into the forest, discovered the extent of\ntheir infamy, and they tied the sisters together, the wrists of one to\nthe ankles of the other, and they led them to the stream, and no sooner\nhad they disappeared beneath the black waters than there was almighty\nsplashing and bubbling of water, and there came crawling from the place\nwhere the unfaithful wives had sunk so terrible a monster that the seven\nbrothers fled in fear.\n\nThis was the Green One, with his long ugly snout, cold, vicious eyes,\nand his great clawed feet. Some say that these women had been changed by\nmagic into the Crocodile of the Pool, and many people believe this and\nspeak of the Green One in the plural.\n\nCertain it is, that this terrible crocodile lived through the ages--none\nhunting her, she was left in indisputable possession of the flat\nsand-bank wherein to lay her eggs, and ranged the sandy shore of the\ncreek undisturbed.\n\nShe was regarded with awe; sacrifices, living and dead, were offered to\nher from time to time, and sometimes a cripple or two was knocked on the\nhead and left by the water's edge for her pleasure. She was indeed a\nveritable scavenger of crime for the neighbouring villages about, and\nearned some sort of respect, for, as the saying went:\n\n\"Sandi does not speak the language of the Green One.\"\n\nSometimes M'zooba would go afield, leaving the quietude of the creek and\nthe pool, which was her own territory, for the more adventurous life of\nthe river, and here one day she lay, the whole of her body submerged and\nonly her wicked eyes within an eighth of an inch of the water's surface,\nwhen a timorous young roebuck came picking a cautious way through the\nforest across the open plantations to the water's edge. He stopped from\ntime to time apprehensively, trembling in every limb at the slightest\nsound, looking this way and that, then taking a few more steps and again\nsearching the cruel world for danger before he reached the water's edge.\n\nThen, after a final look round, he lowered his soft muzzle to the cool\nwaters. Swift as lightning the Green One flashed her long snout out of\nthe water, and gripped the tender head of the buck. Ruthlessly she\npulled, dragging the struggling deer after her till first its neck and\nthen its shoulders, then finally the last frantic waving stump of its\nwhite tail went under the dark waters.\n\nOut in midstream a white little boat was moving steadily up the river\nand on the awning-shaded bridge an indignant young man witnessed the\ntragedy. The Green One had her larder under a large shelving rock half a\ndozen feet beneath the water. Into this cavity her long hard nose flung\nher dead victim, and her four powerful hands covered the entrance to the\nwater cave with sand and rock. More than satisfied with her morning's\nwork, the Green One came to the surface of the water to bask in the\nglowing warmth of the morning sunlight.\n\nShe took a survey upon the world, made up of low-lying shores and a hot\nblue sky. She saw a river, broad and oily, and a strange white object\nwhich she had seen often before smoking towards her.\n\nAnd that was the last thing she ever saw; for Bones, on the bridge of\nthe _Zaire_, squinted along the sights of his Express and pressed the\ntrigger. Struck in the head by an explosive bullet, the Green One went\nout in a flurry of stormy water.\n\n\"Thus perish all rotten old crocodiles,\" said Bones, immensely pleased\nwith himself, and he placed the rifle on the rack.\n\n\"What the devil are you shooting at, so early in the morning?\" asked\nHamilton.\n\nHe came out in his pyjamas, sun helmet on his head, pliant mosquito\nboots reaching to his knees.\n\n\"A crocodile, sir,\" said Bones.\n\n\"Why waste good ammunition on crocodiles?\" asked Hamilton; \"was it\nsomething exceptional?\"\n\n\"A tremendous chap, sir,\" said the enthusiastic Bones, \"some fifty feet\nlong, and as green as----\"\n\n\"As green!\" repeated Hamilton quickly, \"where are we?\"\n\nHe looked with a swift glance along the shore for landmarks.\n\n\"I hope to goodness you have not shot old M'zooba,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't know your friend by name,\" said Bones, \"but why shouldn't I\nshoot him?\"\n\n\"Because, you silly ass,\" said Hamilton, \"she is a sort of sacred\ncrocodile.\"\n\n\"She was never so sacred as she is now, sir, for:\n\n\"She's flapping her wings in the crocodile heaven,\" said Bones,\nflippantly; \"for I'm one of those dead shots--once I draw a bead on an\nanimal----\"\n\n\"Get out a canoe and set the woodmen to dive for the Green One,\" said\nHamilton to his orderly, for a shot crocodile invariably sinks to the\nbottom and can only be recovered by diving.\n\nThey brought it to the surface, and Hamilton groaned.\n\n\"It is M'zooba,\" he said in resigned exasperation. \"Oh, Bones, what an\nass you are!\"\n\nBones said nothing, but walked to the stern of the ship and lowered the\nblue ensign to half-mast--a piece of impertinence which Hamilton did not\ndiscover till a long time afterwards.\n\nNow whatever might be the desire or wish of Hamilton, and however much\nhe might on ordinary occasions depend upon the loyalty of his warders\nand his men, in this matter of the green crocodile he was entirely at\ntheir mercy, for he could not call them together asking them to speak no\ndeath of the Green One without magnifying the importance of Lieutenant\nTibbetts' rash act. The only attitude he could adopt was to treat the\nGreen One and her untimely end as something which was in the day's work\nneither to be lamented nor acclaimed, and when, at the first village, a\ndoleful deputation, comprising a worried chief and a sulky witch doctor,\ncalled upon him to bemoan the tragedy, he treated the matter with great\njoviality.\n\n\"For what is a crocodile more or less in this river?\" he asked.\n\n\"Lord, this was no crocodile,\" said the witch doctor, \"but a very\nreverend ghost, and it has been our Ju-ju for many years, bringing us\ngood crops and fair weather for our goodness, and has eaten up all the\ndevils and sickness which came to our villages. Now it is gone nothing\nbut ill fortune can come to us.\"\n\n\"Bugobo,\" said Hamilton, \"you talk like a foolish one, for how may a\ncrocodile who does not leave the water, and moreover is evil and old, a\nstealer of women and children and dangerous to your goats, how can this\nthing bring good fortune to any people?\"\n\n\"How can the river run, lord?\" replied the man, \"and yet it does.\"\n\nHamilton thought for a moment.\n\n\"Now I tell you this, and you shall say to all people who ask you, that\nby my magic I will bring another green one to this stream, greater and\nlarger than the one who has gone, and she shall be ju-ju for all men.\"\n\n\"And now,\" he said to Bones, when the deputation had left, \"it is up to\nyou to go out and find a nice, respectable crocodile to take the place\nof the lady you have so light-heartedly destroyed.\"\n\nBones gasped.\n\n\"Dear old feller,\" he said feebly, \"the habits and customs of fauna of\nthis land are entirely beyond me. I will fetch you a crocodile, sir,\nwith the greatest of pleasure, although as far as I know there is\nnothing laid down in the King's regulations of the warrants for pay and\npromotion defining the catching of crocodiles as part of an officer's\nduty.\"\n\nHamilton made no further move towards replacing the lost Spirit of the\nPool until he learnt that his offer had been taken very seriously, and\nthat the coming of the great new Green One to the pool, was a subject of\ndiscussion up and down the river.\n\nNow here is a fact which official records go to substantiate. Although\nthe \"Reports of the Territories\" take no cognizance of ghosts and\nspirits and other occult influence, dealing rather with such mundane\nfacts as the condition of crops and the discipline of the races, yet the\nreports of that particular year in this one district made gloomy reading\nboth for Hamilton and for the Administrator in his far-off stone house.\n\nThough the crops throughout the whole of the country were good that\nHamilton was apprehensive about the consequences--for men fight better\nwith a full larder behind them--yet in this immediate neighbourhood of\nthe pool, within its sphere of influence, so to speak, the crops failed\nmiserably, and the fish which haunt the shallow stream beneath the big\nstream near the channel took it into their silly heads to migrate to\nother distant waters. Here, then, was the consequence of Bones' murder\ndemonstrated to a most alarming extent. There was a blight in the\npotatoes; the maize crop, for some unaccountable reason, was a meagre\none; there were three unexpected cases of sleeping sickness followed by\nmadness in an interior village, and, crowning disaster of all, one of\nthose sudden storms which sweep across the river came upon the village,\nand lightning struck the huts.\n\n\"My son,\" said Hamilton, when they brought the news to him, \"you have\ngot to go out and find a green crocodile, quick.\"\n\nSo Bones went up the river with the naphtha launch, leaving to Hamilton\nthe delicate task of finding a natural explanation for all the horrors\nwhich had come upon the unfortunate people.\n\nGreen crocodiles are rare even on the great river which had half a\nmillion other kinds of crocodiles to its credit, for green is both a\nsign of age, and by common report indicative of cannibalistic\ntendencies.\n\nIn whatever veneration the Green One of the Pool might be held, such\nrespect did not extend to other parts of the river, where the green ones\nwere sought out and slain in their early youth. Bones spent an exciting\nseven days chasing, lassoing and, at tunes in self-defence, shooting at\ngreat reptiles without getting any nearer to the object of his search.\n\n\"Ahmet,\" said he, in despair, \"it seems that there are no green\ncrocodiles on this river.\"\n\n\"Lord, there are very few,\" admitted the man; \"for the people kill green\ncrocodiles owing to their evil influence.\"\n\nAt every village there was news for Bones which lightened his heart.\nSome one had seen such a monster, it lived in a pool or lorded some\ncreek, generally only get-at-able in a canoe; and here Bones, with his\nHoussas, would wait smoking furiously, with baited lines cunningly laid\nfrom thick underbrush or some tethered goat, bleating invitingly on the\nbanks. But never once did the hunter catch so much as a glimpse of\ngreen. There were yellow crocodiles, grey crocodiles, crocodiles the\ncolour of the sand, or the dark brown bed of the river, but nothing\nwhich by any stretch of imagination could be called green.\n\nAnd urgent messages came to Bones. The _Zaire_ itself, in charge of\nAbiboo, came steaming up carrying a letter filled with unnecessary\nabuse, for Hamilton was getting rattled by the extraordinary\nmanifestations which he received every day of the potency of this slain\nmonster. Bones sent the sergeant back in the launch with an\ninsubordinate message, and commandeered the _Zaire_ with her superior\naccommodation for himself.\n\n\"There is only one thing to do,\" he said, \"and that is to consult jolly\nold Bosambo.\"\n\nSo he put the head of the _Zaire_ to the Ochori country, and on the\nsecond day arrived at the city.\n\n\"Lord,\" said Bosambo, loftily, \"crocodiles I have by thousands.\"\n\n\"Green ones?\" asked Bones anxiously.\n\n\"Lord, of every colour,\" said Bosambo, \"blue or green or red, even\ngolden crocodiles have I in my splendid river. But they will cost great\nmoney because they are very cunning, and my hunters of crocodiles are\nindependent men who do not care to work.\"\n\nBones dried up the flood of eloquence quickly.\n\n\"O Bosambo,\" said he, \"there is no money for this palaver, but a green\ncrocodile I must have because the evil people of the Lower Isisi say I\nhave put a spell on their land because I slew the Green One, M'zooba,\nalso this crocodile must I have before the moon is due. My Lord\nM'ilitani has sent me many powerful messages to this effect.\"\n\nThis was another matter, and Bosambo looked dubious.\n\n\"Lord,\" said he, \"what manner of green was this crocodile, for I never\nsaw it?\"\n\nBones looked round.\n\nNeither the green of the trees he saw, nor the green of the grass\nunderfoot, nor the green of the elephant grass growing strongly on the\nriver's edge, nor the tender green of the high trees above, nor the\ntender green of the young Isisi palms; and yet the exact shade of green\nit was necessary to secure. He ransacked all his books, turned over all\nhis possessions and Hamilton's too, in an endeavour to match the\ncrocodile. There was a suit of pyjamas of Hamilton's which had a stripe\nvery near, but not quite.\n\n\"O Ahmet,\" said Bones at last in desperation, \"go to the storeman, and\nlet him bring all the paints he has so that I may show Bosambo a certain\ncolour.\"\n\nThey found the exact shade at last on a ten-pound tin of Aspinall\nenamels, and Bosambo thought long.\n\n\"Lord,\" said he, \"I think I know where I may find just such a crocodile\nas you want.\"\n\nLate that night Bones met Bosambo before his hut in a long and earnest\npalaver, and an hour before dawn he went out with Bosambo and his\nhuntsmen, and was pulled to a certain creek in the Ochori land which is\nnotorious for the size and strength of its crocodiles.\n\n\nII\n\nNo doubt but Hamilton had a serious task before him, for although the\ngrievance which he had to allay was limited to the restricted area over\nwhich the spirit of M'zooba brooded, yet the people of the crocodile\nhad many sympathizers who resented as bitterly as the affected parties\nthis interference with what Downing Street called \"local religious\ncustoms.\"\n\nA wholly unauthorized palaver was held in the forest which was attended\nby delegations from the Akasava and the N'gombi, and spies brought the\nnews to Hamilton that the little witch doctors were going through the\nvillages carrying stories of desolation which had come as the result of\nM'zooba's death.\n\nThe palaver Hamilton dispensed with some brusqueness. Twenty soldiers\nand a machine gun were uninvited guests to the gathering, and the\nmeeting retired in disorder. Two of the witch doctors Hamilton's men\ncaught. One he flogged with all the village looking on, and the other he\nsent to the Village of Irons for twelve months.\n\nAnd all the time he spoke of the newer green one which was coming, which\nhis magic would invoke, and which would surely appear \"tied by one leg\"\nto a stake near the pool, for all men to see.\n\nHe founded a sect of new-green-one worshippers (quite unwittingly). It\nneeded only the corporeal presence of his novel deity to wipe out the\nfeelings of distrust which violence had not wholly dispelled.\n\nDay after day passed, but no word came from Bones, and Captain Hamilton\ncursed his subordinate, his subordinate's relations, and all the cruelty\nof fate which brought Bones into his command. Then, unexpectantly, the\ntruant arrived, arrived proud and triumphant in the early morning\nbefore Hamilton was awake. He sneaked into the village so quietly that\neven the Houssa sentry who dozed across the threshold of Hamilton's hut\nwas not aware of his return; and silently, with fiercely whispered\ninjunctions, so that the surprise should be all the more complete, Bones\nlanded his unruly cargo, its feet chained, his great muzzle lassoed and\nbound with raw hide, its powerful and damaging tail firmly fixed between\ntwo planks of wood (a special idea for which Bones was responsible).\nThen Lieutenant Tibbetts went to the hut of his chief and woke him.\n\n\"So here you are, are you?\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"I am here,\" said Bones with trembling pride, so that Hamilton knew his\nsubordinate had been successful; \"according to your instructions, sir, I\nhave captured the green crocodile. He is of monstrous size, and vastly\nsuperior to your partly-worn lady friend. Also,\" he said, \"as per your\ninstructions, conveyed to me in your letter dated the twenty-third\ninstant, I have fastened same by right leg in the vicinity of the pool;\nat least,\" he corrected carefully, \"he was fastened, but owing to\ncertain technical difficulties he slipped cable, so to speak, and is\nwallowing in his native element.\"\n\n\"You are not rotting, Bones, are you?\" asked Hamilton, busy with his\ntoilet.\n\n\"Perfectly true and sound, sir, I never rot,\" said Bones stiffly; \"give\nme a job of work to do, give me a task, put me upon my metal, sir, and\nwith the assistance of jolly old Bosambo----\"\n\n\"Is Bosambo in this?\"\n\nBones hesitated.\n\n\"He assisted me very considerably, sir,\" he said; \"but, so to speak, the\nmain idea was mine.\"\n\nThe chief's drum summoned the villages to the palaver house, but the\nnews had already filtered through the little township, and a crowd had\ngathered waiting eagerly to hear the message which Hamilton had to give\nthem.\n\n\"O people,\" he said, addressing them from the hill of palaver, \"all I\nhave promised you I have performed. Behold now in the pool--and you\nshall come with me to see this wonder--is one greater than M'zooba, a\nvast and splendid spirit which shall protect your crops and be as\nM'zooba was, and better than was M'zooba. All this I have done for you.\"\n\n\"Lord Tibbetti has done for you,\" prompted Bones, in a hoarse whisper.\n\n\"All this have I done for you,\" repeated Hamilton firmly, \"because I\nlove you.\"\n\nHe led the way through the broad, straggling plantation to the great\npool which begins in a narrow creek leading from the river and ends in a\nsprawl of water to the east of the village.\n\nThe whole countryside stood about watching the still water, but nothing\nhappened.\n\n\"Can't you whistle him and make him come up or something?\" asked\nHamilton.\n\n\"Sir,\" said an indignant Bones, \"I am no crocodile tamer; willing as I\nam to oblige you, and clever as I am with parlour tricks, I have not\nyet succeeded in inducing a crocodile to come to heel after a week's\nacquaintance.\"\n\nBut native people are very patient.\n\nThey stood or squatted, watching the unmoved surface of the water for\nhalf an hour, and then suddenly there was a stir and a little gasp of\npleasurable apprehension ran through the assembly.\n\nThen slowly the new one came up. He made for a sand-bank, which showed\nabove the water in the centre of the pool; first his snout, then his\nlong body emerged from the water, and Hamilton gasped.\n\n\"Good heavens, Bones!\" he said in a startled whisper, and his\nastonishment was echoed from a thousand throats.\n\nAnd well might he be amazed at the spectacle which the complacent Bones\nhad secured for him.\n\nFor this great reptile was more than green, he was a green so vivid that\nit put the colours of the forest to shame. A bright, glittering green\nand along the centre of his broad back one zig-zag splash of orange.\n\n\"Phew,\" whistled Hamilton, \"this is something like.\"\n\nThe roar of approval from the people was unmistakable. The crocodile\nturned his evil head and for a moment, as it seemed to Bones, his eyes\nglinted viciously in the direction of the young and enterprising\nofficer. And Bones admitted after to a feeling of panic.\n\nThen with a malignant \"woof!\" like the hoarse, growling bark of a dog,\nmagnified a hundred times, he slid back into the water, a great living\nstreak of vivid green and disappeared to the cool retreat at the bottom\nof the pool.\n\n\"You have done splendidly, Bones, splendidly!\" said Hamilton, and\nclapped him on the back; \"really you are a most enterprising devil.\"\n\n\"Not at all, sir,\" said Bones.\n\nHe ate his dinner on the _Zaire_, answering with monosyllables the\nquestions which Hamilton put to him regarding the quest and the place of\nthe origin of this wonderful beast. It was after dinner when they were\nsmoking their cigars in the gloom as the _Zaire_ was steaming across its\nway to the shore where a wooding offered an excuse for a night's stay,\nand Bones gave voice to his thoughts.\n\nAnd curiously enough his conversation did not deal directly or\nindirectly with his discovery.\n\n\"When was this boat decorated last, sir?\" he asked.\n\n\"About six months before Sanders left,\" replied Hamilton in surprise;\n\"just why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Nothing, sir,\" said Bones, and whistled light-heartedly. Then he\nreturned to the subject.\n\n\"I only asked you because I thought the enamel work in the cabin and all\nthat sort of thing has worn very well.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is good wearing stuff,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"That green paint in the bathroom is rather _chic_, isn't it? Is that\ngood wearing stuff?\"\n\n\"The enamel?\" smiled Hamilton. \"Yes, I believe that is very good\nwearing. I am not a whale on domestic matters, Bones, but I should\nimagine that it would last for another year without showing any sign of\nwear.\"\n\n\"Is it waterproof at all?\" asked Bones, after another pause.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean would it wash off if a lot of water were applied to it?\"\n\n\"No, I should not imagine it would,\" said Hamilton, \"what makes you\nask?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing!\" said Bones carelessly and whistled, looking up to the\nstars that were peeping from the sky; and the inside of Lieutenant\nTibbetts was one large expansive grin.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nHENRY HAMILTON BONES\n\n\nLieutenant Francis Augustus Tibbetts of the Houssas was at some\ndisadvantage with his chief and friend. Lieutenant F. A. Tibbetts might\ntake a perfectly correct attitude, might salute on every possible\noccasion that a man could salute, might click his heels together in the\nGerman fashion (he had spent a year at Heidelberg), might be stiffly\nformal and so greet his superior that he contrived to combine a dutiful\nrecognition with the cut direct, but never could he overcome one fatal\nobstacle to marked avoidance--he had to grub with Hamilton.\n\nBones was hurt. Hamilton had behaved to him as no brother officer should\nbehave. Hamilton had spoken harshly and cruelly in the matter of a\ncommission with which he had entrusted his subordinate, and with which\nthe aforesaid subordinate had lamentably failed to cope.\n\nUp in the Akasava country a certain wise man named M'bisibi had\npredicted the coming of a devil-child who should be born on a night when\nthe moon lay so on the river and certain rains had fallen in the\nforest.\n\nAnd this child should be called \"Ewa,\" which is death; and first his\nmother would die and then his father; and he would grow up to be a\nscourge to his people and a pestilence to his nation, and crops would\nwither when he walked past them, and the fish in the river would float\nbelly up in stinking death, and until Ewa M'faba himself went out,\nnothing but ill-fortune should come to the N'gombi-Isisi.\n\nThus M'bisibi predicted, and the word went up and down the river, for\nthe prophet was old and accounted wise even by Bosambo of the Ochori.\n\nIt came to Hamilton quickly enough, and he had sent Bones post-haste to\nawait the advent of any unfortunate youngster who was tactless enough to\nput in an appearance at such an inauspicious moment as would fulfil the\nprediction of M'bisibi.\n\nAnd Bones had gone to the wrong village, and that in the face of his\nsteersman's and his sergeant's protest that he was going wrong.\nFortunately, by reliable account, no child had been born in the village,\nand the prediction was unfulfilled.\n\n\"Otherwise,\" said Hamilton, \"its young life would have been on your\nhead.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Bones.\n\n\"I didn't tell you there were two villages called Inkau,\" Hamilton\nconfessed, \"because I didn't realize you were chump enough to go to the\nwrong one.\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" agreed Bones, patiently.\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Hamilton, \"I thought the idea of saving the lives of\ninnocent babes would have been sufficient incentive.\"\n\n\"Naturally, sir,\" said Bones, with forced geniality.\n\n\"I've come to one conclusion about you, Bones,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Bones, \"that I'm an ass, sir, I think?\"\n\nHamilton nodded--it was too hot to speak.\n\n\"It was an interestin' conclusion,\" said Bones, thoughtfully, \"not\nwithout originality--when it first occurred to you, but as a conclusion,\nif you will pardon my criticism, sir, if you will forgive me for\nsuggestin' as much--in callin' me an ass, sir: apart from its bein'\ncontrary to the spirit an' letter of the Army Act--God Save the\nKing!--it's a bit low, sir.\" And he left his superior officer without\nanother word. For three days they sat at breakfast, tiffin and dinner,\nand neither said more than:\n\n\"May I pass you the bread, sir?\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir; have you the salt, sir?\"\n\nHamilton was so busy a man that he might have forgotten the feud, but\nfor the insistence of Bones, who never lost an opportunity of reminding\nhis No. 1 that he was mortally hurt.\n\nOne night, dinner had reached the stage where two young officers of\nHoussas sat primly side by side on the verandah sipping their coffee.\nNeither spoke, and the s\u00e9ance might have ended with the conventional\n\"Good night\" and that punctilious salute which Bones invariably gave,\nand which Hamilton as punctiliously returned, but for the apparition of\na dark figure which crossed the broad space of parade ground\nhesitatingly as though not certain of his way, and finally came with\ndragging feet through Sanders' garden to the edge of the verandah.\n\nIt was the figure of a small boy, very thin; Hamilton could see this\nthrough the half-darkness.\n\nThe boy was as naked as when he was born, and he carried in his hand a\nsingle paddle.\n\n\"O boy,\" said Hamilton, \"I see you.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\" said the boy in a frightened tone, and hesitated, as though he\nwere deciding whether it would be better to bolt, or to conclude his\ndesperate enterprise.\n\n\"Come up to me,\" said Hamilton, kindly.\n\nHe recognized by the dialect that the visitor had come a long way, as\nindeed he had, for his old canoe was pushed up amongst the elephant\ngrass a mile away from headquarters, and he had spent three days and\nnights upon the river. He came up, an embarrassed and a frightened lad,\nand stood twiddling his toes on the unaccustomed smoothness of the big\nstoep.\n\n\"Where do you come from, and why have you come?\" asked Hamilton.\n\n\"Lord, I have come from the village of M'bisibi,\" said the boy; \"my\nmother has sent me because she fears for her life, my father being away\non a great hunt. As for me,\" he went on, \"my name is Tilimi-N'kema.\"\n\n\"Speak on, Tilimi the Monkey,\" said Hamilton, \"tell me why the woman\nyour mother fears for her life.\"\n\nThe boy was silent for a spell; evidently he was trying to recall the\nexact formula which had been dinned into his unreceptive brain, and to\nrepeat word for word the lesson which he had learned parrotwise.\n\n\"Thus says the woman my mother,\" he said at last, with the blank,\nmonotonous delivery peculiar to all small boys who have been rehearsed\nin speech, \"on a certain day when the moon was at full and the rain was\nin the forest so that we all heard it in the village, my mother bore a\nchild who is my own brother, and, lord, because she feared things which\nthe old man M'bisibi had spoken she went into the forest to a certain\nwitch doctor, and there the child was born. To my mind,\" said the lad,\nwith a curious air of wisdom which is the property of the youthful\nnative from whom none of the mysteries of life or death are hidden, \"it\nis better she did this, for they would have made a sacrifice of her\nchild. Now when she came back, and they spoke to her, she said that the\nboy was dead. But this is the truth, lord, that she had left this child\nwith the witch doctor, and now----\" he hesitated again.\n\n\"And now?\" repeated Hamilton.\n\n\"Now, lord,\" said the boy, \"this witch doctor, whose name is Bogolono,\nsays she must bring him rich presents at the full of every moon, because\nher son and my brother is the devil-child whom M'bisibi has predicted.\nAnd if she brings no rich presents he will take the child to the\nvillage, and there will be an end.\"\n\nHamilton called his orderly.\n\n\"Give this boy some chop,\" he said; \"to-morrow we will have a longer\npalaver.\"\n\nHe waited till the man and his charge were out of earshot, then he\nturned to Bones.\n\n\"Bones,\" he said, seriously, \"I think you had better leave unobtrusively\nfor M'bisibi's village, find the woman, and bring her to safety. You\nwill know the village,\" he added, unnecessarily, \"it is the one you\ndidn't find last time.\"\n\nBones left insubordinately and made no response.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nII\n\nBosambo, with his arms folded across his brawny chest, looked curiously\nat the deputation which had come to him.\n\n\"This is a bad palaver,\" said Bosambo, \"for it seems to me that when\nlittle chiefs do that which is wrong, it is an ill thing; but when great\nkings, such as your master Iberi, stand at the back of such wrongdoings,\nthat is the worst thing of all, and though this M'bisibi is a wise man,\nas we all know, and indeed the only wise man of your people, has brought\nout this devil-child, and makes a killing palaver, then M'ilitani will\ncome very quickly with his soldiers and there will be an end to little\nchiefs and big chiefs alike.\"\n\n\"Lord, that will be so,\" said the messenger, \"unless all chiefs in the\nland stand in brotherhood together. And because we know Sandi loves you,\nand M'ilitani also, and that Tibbetti himself is as tender to you as a\nbrother, M'bisibi sent this word saying, 'Go to Bosambo, and say\nM'bisibi, the wise man, bids him come to a great and fearful palaver\ntouching the matter of several devils. Tell him also that great evil\nwill come to this land, to his land and to mine, to his wife and the\nwives of his counsellors, and to his children and theirs, unless we make\nan end to certain devils.'\"\n\nBosambo, chin on clenched fist, looked thoughtfully at the other.\n\n\"This cannot be,\" said he in a troubled voice; \"for though I die and all\nthat is wonderful to me shall pass out of this world, yet I must do no\nthing which is unlawful in the eyes of Sandi, my master, and of the\ngreat ones he has left behind to fulfil the law. Say this to M'bisibi\nfrom me, that I think he is very wise and understands ghosts and\nsuch-like palavers. Also say that if he puts curses upon my huts I will\ncome with my spearmen to him, and if aught follows I will hang him by\nthe ears from a high tree, though he sleeps with ghosts and commands\nwhole armies of devils; this palaver is finished.\"\n\nThe messenger carried the word back to M'bisibi and the council of the\nchiefs and the eldermen who sat in the palaver house, and old as he was\nand wise by all standards, M'bisibi shivered, for, as he explained, that\nwhich Bosambo said would he do. For this is peculiar to no race or\ncolour, that old men love life dearer than young.\n\n\"Bogolono, you shall bring the child,\" he said, turning to one who sat\nat his side, string upon string of human teeth looped about his neck and\nhis eyes circled with white ashes, \"and it shall be sacrificed according\nto the custom, as it was in the days of my fathers and of their\nfathers.\"\n\nThey chose a spot in the forest, where four young trees stood at corners\nof a rough square. With their short bush knives they lopped the tender\nbranches away, leaving four pliant poles that bled stickily. With great\ncare they drew down the tops of these trees until they nearly met,\ncutting the heads so that there was no overlapping. To these four ends\nthey fastened ropes, one for each arm and for each ankle of the devil\nchild, and with other ropes they held the saplings to their place.\n\n\"Now this is the magic of it,\" said M'bisibi, \"that when the moon is\nfull to-night we shall sacrifice first a goat, and then a fowl, casting\ncertain parts into the fire which shall be made of white gum, and I will\nmake certain marks upon the child's face and upon his belly, and then I\nwill cut these ropes so that to the four ends of the world we shall cast\nforth this devil, who will no longer trouble us.\"\n\nThat night came many chiefs, Iberi of the Akasava, Tilini of the Lesser\nIsisi, Efele (the Tornado) of the N'gombi, Lisu (the Seer) of the Inner\nTerritories, but Lilongo[12] (as they called Bosambo of the Ochori), did\nnot come.\n\n[Footnote 12: \"Lilongo\" is from the noun \"balongo\"--blood, and means\nliterally \"he-who-breaks-blood-friendships.\"--E. W.]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nIII\n\nBones reached the village two hours before the time of sacrifice and\nlanded a force of twenty Houssas and a small Maxim gun. The village was\npeaceable, and there was no sign of anything untoward. Save this. The\nvillage was given over to old people and children. M'bisibi was an\nhour--two hours--four hours in the forest. He had gone\nnorth--east--south--none knew whither.\n\nThe very evasiveness of the replies put Bones into a fret. He scouted\nthe paths and found indications of people having passed over all three.\n\nHe sent his gun back to the _Zaire_, divided his party into three, and\naccompanied by half a dozen men, he himself took the middle path.\n\nFor an hour he trudged, losing his way, and finding it again. He came\nupon a further division of paths and split up his little force again.\n\nIn the end he found himself alone, struggling over the rough ground in a\ndarkness illuminated only by the electric lamp he carried, and making\nfor a faint gleam of red light which showed through the trees ahead.\n\nM'bisibi held the child on his outstretched hands, a fat little child,\nwith large, wondering eyes that stared solemnly at the dancing flames,\nand sucked a small brown thumb contentedly.\n\n\"Behold this child, oh chiefs and people,\" said M'bisibi, \"who was born\nas I predicted, and is filled with devils!\"\n\nThe baby turned his head so that his fat little neck was all rolled and\ncreased, and said \"Ah!\" to the pretty fire, and chuckled.\n\n\"Even now the devils speak,\" said M'bisibi, \"but presently you shall\nhear them screaming through the world because I have scattered them,\"\nand he made his way to the bowed saplings.\n\nBones, his face scratched and bleeding, his uniform torn in a dozen\nplaces, came swiftly after him.\n\n\"My bird, I think,\" said Bones, and caught the child unscientifically.\n\nPicture Bones with a baby under his arm--a baby indignant, outraged,\ninfernally uncomfortable, and grimacing a yell into being.\n\n\"Lord,\" said M'bisibi, breathing quickly, \"what do you seek?\"\n\n\"That which I have,\" said Bones, waving him off with the black muzzle of\nhis automatic Colt. \"Tomorrow you shall answer for many crimes.\"\n\nHe backed quickly to the cover of the woods, scenting the trouble that\nwas coming.\n\nHe heard the old man's roar.\n\n\"O people ... this white man will loose devils upon the land!\"\n\nThen a throwing spear snicked the trunk of a tree, and another, for\nthere were no soldiers, and this congregation of exorcisers were mad\nwith wrath at the thought of the evil which Tibbetti was preparing for\nthem.\n\n\"Snick!\"\n\nA spear struck Bones' boot.\n\n\"Shut your eyes, baby,\" said Bones, and fired into the brown. Then he\nran for his life. Over roots and fallen trees he fell and stumbled, his\ntiny passenger yelling desperately.\n\n\"Oh, shut up!\" snarled Bones, \"what the dickens are you shouting\nabout--hey? Haven't I saved your young life, you ungrateful little\ndevil?\"\n\nNow and again he would stop to consult his illuminated compass. That the\npursuit continued he knew, but he had the dubious satisfaction of\nknowing, too, that he had left the path and was in the forest.\n\nThen he heard a faint shot, and another, and another, and grinned.\n\nHis pursuers had stumbled upon a party of Houssas.\n\nFrom sheer exhaustion the baby had fallen asleep. Babies were\nconfoundedly heavy--Bones had never observed the fact before, but with\nthe strap of his sword belt he fashioned a sling that relieved him of\nsome of the weight.\n\nHe took it easier now, for he knew M'bisibi's men would be frightened\noff. He rested for half an hour on the ground, and then came a snuffling\nleopard walking silently through the forest, betraying his presence\nonly by the two green danger-lamps of his eyes.\n\nBones sat up and flourished his lamp upon the startled beast, which\ngrowled in fright, and went scampering through the forest like the great\ncat that he was.\n\nThe growl woke Bones' charge, and he awoke hungry and disinclined to\nfurther sleep without that inducement and comfort which his nurse was in\nno position to offer, whereupon Bones snuggled the whimpering child.\n\n\"He's a wicked old leopard!\" he said, \"to come and wake a child at this\ntime of the night.\"\n\nThe knuckle of Bones' little finger soothed the baby, though it was a\npoor substitute for the nutriment it had every right to expect, and it\nwhimpered itself to sleep.\n\nLieutenant Tibbetts looked at his compass again. He had located the\nshots to eastward, but he did not care to make a bee-line in that\ndirection for fear of falling upon some of the enemy, whom he knew would\nbe, at this time, making their way to the river.\n\nFor two hours before dawn he snatched a little sleep, and was awakened\nby a fierce tugging at his nose. He got up, laid the baby on the soft\nground, and stood with arms akimbo, and his monocle firmly fixed,\nsurveying his noisy companion.\n\n\"What the dooce are you making all this row about?\" he asked\nindignantly. \"Have a little patience, young feller, exercise a little\n_suaviter in modo_, dear old baby!\"\n\nBut still the fat little morsel on the ground continued his noisy\nmonologue, protesting in a language which is of an age rather than of a\nrace, against the cruelty and the thoughtlessness and the distressing\nlack of consideration which his elder and better was showing him.\n\n\"I suppose you want some grub,\" said Bones, in dismay; and looked round\nhelplessly.\n\nHe searched the pocket of his haversack, and had the good fortune to\nfind a biscuit; his vacuum flask had just half a cup of warm tea. He fed\nthe baby with soaked biscuit and drank the tea himself.\n\n\"You ought to have a bath or something,\" said Bones, severely; but it\nwas not until an hour later that he found a forest pool in which to\nperform the ablution.\n\nAt three o'clock in the afternoon, as near as he could judge, for his\nwatch had stopped, he struck a path, and would have reached the village\nbefore sundown, but for the fact that he again missed the path, and\nlearnt of this fact about the same time he discovered he had lost his\ncompass.\n\nBones looked dismally at the wide-awake child.\n\n\"Dear old companion in arms,\" he said, gloomily, \"we are lost.\"\n\nThe baby's face creased in a smile.\n\n\"It's nothing to laugh about, you silly ass,\" said Bones.\n\n\nIV\n\n\"Master, of our Lord Tibbetti I do not know,\" said M'bisibi sullenly.\n\n\"Yet you shall know before the sun is black,\" said Hamilton, \"and your\nyoung men shall find him, or there is a tree for you, old man, a quick\ndeath by _Ewa_!\"\n\n\"I have sought, my lord,\" said M'bisibi, \"all my hunters have searched\nthe forest, yet we have not found him. A certain devil-pot is here.\"\n\nHe fumbled under a native cloth and drew forth Bones' compass.\n\n\"This only could we find on the forest path that leads to Inilaki.\"\n\n\"And the child is with him?\"\n\n\"So men say,\" said M'bisibi, \"though by my magic I know that the child\nwill die, for how can a white man who knows nothing of little children\ngive him life and comfort? Yet,\" he amended carefully, since it was\nnecessary to preserve the character of the intended victim, \"if this\nchild is indeed a devil child, as I believe, he will lead my lord\nTibbetti to terrible places and return himself unharmed.\"\n\n\"He will lead you to a place more terrible,\" said M'ilitani,\nsignificantly, and sent a nimble climber into the trees to fasten a\nblock and tackle to a stout branch, and thread a rope through.\n\nIt was so effective that M'bisibi, an old man, became most energetically\nactive. _Lokali_ and swift messengers sent his villages to the search.\nEvery half-hour the Hotchkiss gun of the _Zaire_ banged noisily; and\nHamilton, tramping through the woods, felt his heart sink as hour after\nhour passed without news of his comrade.\n\n\"I tell you this, lord,\" said the headman, who accompanied him, \"that I\nthink Tibbetti is dead and the child also. For this wood is filled with\nghosts and savage beasts, also many strong and poisonous snakes. See,\nlord!\" He pointed.\n\nThey had reached a clearing where the grass was rich and luxuriant,\nwhere overshadowing branches formed an idealic bower, where heavy white\nwaxen flowers were looped from branch to branch holding the green boughs\nin their parasitical clutch. Hamilton followed the direction of his\neyes. In the middle of the clearing a long, sinuous shape, dark brown,\nand violently coloured with patches of green and vermillion, that was\nswaying backward and forward, hissing angrily at some object before it.\n\n\"Good God!\" said Hamilton, and dropped his hand on his revolver, but\nbefore it was clear of his holster, there came a sharp crack, and the\nsnake leapt up and fell back as a bullet went snip-snapping through the\nundergrowth. Then Hamilton saw Bones. Bones in his shirtsleeves,\nbareheaded, his big pipe in his mouth, who came hurriedly through the\ntrees pistol in hand.\n\n\"Naughty boy!\" he said, reproachfully, and stooping, picked up a\nsqualling brown object from the ground. \"Didn't Daddy tell you not to\ngo near those horrid snakes? Daddy spank you----\"\n\nThen he caught sight of the amazed Hamilton, clutched the baby in one\nhand, and saluted with the other.\n\n\"Baby present and correct, sir,\" he said, formally.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What are you going to do with it?\" asked Hamilton, after Bones had\nindulged in the luxury of a bath and had his dinner.\n\n\"Do with what, sir?\" asked Bones.\n\n\"With this?\"\n\nHamilton pointed to a crawling morsel who was at that moment looking up\nto Bones for approval.\n\n\"What do you expect me to do, sir?\" asked Bones, stiffly; \"the mother is\ndead and he has no father. I feel a certain amount of responsibility\nabout Henry.\"\n\n\"And who the dickens is Henry?\" asked Hamilton.\n\nBones indicated the child with a fine gesture.\n\n\"Henry Hamilton Bones, sir,\" he said grandly. \"The child of the\nregiment,\" he went on; \"adopted by me to be a prop for my declining\nyears, sir.\"\n\n\"Heaven and earth!\" said Hamilton, breathlessly.\n\nHe went aft to recover his nerve, and returned to become an unseen\nspectator to a purely domestic scene, for Bones had immersed the\nsqualling infant in his own india-rubber bath, and was gingerly cleaning\nhim with a mop.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nBONES AT M'FA\n\n\nHamilton of the Houssas coming down to headquarters met Bosambo by\nappointment at the junction of the rivers.\n\n\"O Bosambo,\" said Hamilton, \"I have sent for you to make a _likambo_\nbecause of certain things which my other eyes have seen and my other\nears have heard.\"\n\nTo some men this hint of report from the spies of Government might bring\ndismay and apprehension, but to Bosambo, whose conscience was clear,\nthey awakened only curiosity.\n\n\"Lord, I am your eyes in the Ochori,\" he said with truth, \"and God knows\nI report faithfully.\"\n\nHamilton nodded. He was yellow with fever, and the hand that filled the\nbriar pipe shook with ague. All this Bosambo saw.\n\n\"It is not of you I speak, nor of your people, but of the Akasava and\nthe N'gombi and the evil little men who live in the forest--now is it\ntrue that they speak mockingly of my lord Tibbetti?\"\n\nBosambo hesitated.\n\n\"Lord,\" said he, \"what dogs are they, that they should speak of the\nmighty? Yet I will not lie to you, M'ilitani: they mock Tibbetti,\nbecause he is young and his heart is pure.\"\n\nHamilton nodded again, and stuck out his jaw in troubled meditation.\n\n\"I am a sick man,\" he said, \"and I must rest, sending Tibbetti to watch\nthe river, because the crops are good and there is fish for all men, and\nbecause the people are prosperous, for, Bosambo, in such times there is\nmuch boastfulness, and the tribes are ripe for foolish deeds deserving\nto appear wonderful in the eyes of woman.\"\n\n\"All this I know, M'ilitani,\" said Bosambo, \"and because you are sick,\nmy heart and my stomach are sore. For though I do not love you as I love\nSandi, who is more clever than you, yet I love you well enough to\ngrieve. And Tibbetti also----\"\n\nHe paused.\n\n\"He is young,\" said Hamilton, \"and not yet grown to himself--now you,\nBosambo, shall check men who are insolent to his face, and be to him as\na strong right hand.\"\n\n\"On my head and my life,\" said Bosambo, \"yet, lord M'ilitani, I think\nthat his day will find him, for it is written in the Sura of the Djin\nthat all men are born three times, and the day will come when Bonzi will\nbe born again.\"\n\nHe was in his canoe before Hamilton realized what he had said.\n\n\"Tell me, Bosambo,\" said he, leaning over the side of the _Zaire_,\n\"what name did you call my lord Tibbetti?\"\n\n\"Bonzi,\" said Bosambo, innocently, \"for such I have heard you call him.\"\n\n\"Oh, dog of a thief!\" stormed Hamilton. \"If you speak without respect of\nTibbetti, I will break your head.\"\n\nBosambo looked up with a glint in his big, black eyes.\n\n\"Lord,\" he said, softly, \"it is said on the river 'speak only the words\nwhich high ones speak, and you can say no wrong,' and if you, who are\nwiser than any, call my lord 'Bonzi'--what goat am I that I should not\ncall him 'Bonzi' also?\"\n\nHamilton saw the canoe drift round, saw the flashing paddles dip\nregularly, and the chant of the Ochori boat song came fainter and\nfainter as Bosambo's state canoe began its long journey northward.\n\nHamilton reached headquarters with a temperature of 105, and declined\nBones' well-meant offers to look after him.\n\n\"What you want, dear old officer,\" said Bones, fussing around, \"is\ncareful nursin'. Trust old Bones and he'll pull you back to health, sir.\nKeep up your pecker, sir, an' I'll bring you back so to speak from the\nvalley of the shadow--go to bed an' I'll have a mustard plaster on your\nchest in half a jiffy.\"\n\n\"If you come anywhere near me with a mustard plaster,\" said Hamilton,\npardonably annoyed, \"I'll brain you!\"\n\n\"Don't you think!\" asked Bones anxiously, \"that you ought to put your\nfeet in mustard and water, sir--awfully good tonic for a feller, sir.\nBucks you up an' all that sort of thing, sir; uncle of mine who used to\ntake too much to drink----\"\n\n\"The only chance for me,\" said Hamilton, \"is for you to clear out and\nleave me alone. Bones--quit fooling: I'm a sick man, and you've any\namount of responsibility. Go up to the Isisi and watch things--it's\npretty hard to say this to you, but I'm in your hands.\"\n\nBones said nothing.\n\nHe looked down at the fever-stricken man and thrust his hands in his\npockets.\n\n\"You see, old Bones,\" said Hamilton, and now his friend heard the\nweariness and the weakness in his voice, \"Sanders has a hold on these\nchaps that I haven't quite got ... and ... and ... well, you haven't got\nat all. I don't want to hurt your feelings, but you're young, Bones, and\nthese devils know how amiable you are.\"\n\n\"I'm an ass, sir,\" muttered Bones, shakily, \"an' somehow I understand\nthat this is the time in my jolly old career when I oughtn't to be an\nass.... I'm sorry, sir.\"\n\nHamilton smiled up at him.\n\n\"It isn't for Sanders' sake or mine or your own, Bones--but for--well,\nfor the whole crowd of us--white folk. You'll have to do your best, old\nman.\"\n\nBones took the other's hand, snivelled a bit despite his fierce effort\nof restraint, and went aboard the _Zaire_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Tell all men,\" said B'chumbiri, addressing his impassive relatives,\n\"that I go to a great day and to many strange lands.\"\n\nHe was tall and knobby-kneed, spoke with a squeak at the end of his\ndeeper sentences, and about his tired eyes he had made a red circle with\ncamwood. Round his head he had twisted a wire so tightly that it all but\ncut the flesh: this was necessary, for B'chumbiri had a headache which\nnever left him day or night.\n\nNow he stood, his lank body wrapped in a blanket, and he looked with\ndull eyes from face to face.\n\n\"I see you,\" he said at last, and repeated his motto which had something\nto do with monkeys.\n\nThey watched him go down the street towards the beech where the easiest\ncanoe in the village was moored.\n\n\"It is better if we go after him and put out his eyes,\" said his elder\nbrother; \"else who knows what damage he will do for which we must pay?\"\n\nOnly B'chumbiri's mother looked after him with a mouth that drooped at\nthe side, for he was her only son, all the others being by other wives\nof Mochimo.\n\nHis father and his uncle stood apart and whispered, and presently when,\nwith a great waving of arms, B'chumbiri had embarked, they went out of\nthe village by the forest path and ran tirelessly till they struck the\nriver at its bend.\n\n\"Here we will wait,\" panted the uncle, \"and when B'chumbiri comes we\nwill call him to land, for he has the sickness _mongo_.\"\n\n\"What of Sandi?\" asked the father, who was no gossip.\n\n\"Sandi is gone,\" replied the other, \"and there is no law.\"\n\nPresently B'chumbiri came sweeping round the bend, singing in his poor,\ncracked voice about a land and a people and treasures ... he turned his\ncanoe at his father's bidding, and came obediently to land....\n\nOverhead the sky was a vivid blue, and the water which moved quickly\nbetween the rocky channel of the Lower Isisi caught something of the\nblue, though the thick green of elephant grass by the water's edge and\nthe overhanging spread of gum trees took away from the clarity of\nreflection.\n\nThere was, too, a gentle breeze and a pleasing absence of flies, so that\na man might get under the red and white striped awning of the _Zaire_\nand think or read or dream dreams, and find life a pleasant experience,\nand something to be thankful for.\n\nSuch a day does not often come upon the river, but if it does, the deep\nchannel of the Isisi focuses all the joy of it. Here the river runs as\nstraight as a canal for six miles, the current swifter and stronger\nbetween the guiding banks than elsewhere. There are rocks, charted and\nknown, for the bed of the river undergoes no change, the swift waters\ncarry no sands to choke the fairway, navigation is largely a matter of\nengine power and rule of thumb. Going slowly up stream a little more\nthan two knots an hour, the _Zaire_ was for once a pleasure steamer. Her\nlong-barrelled Hotchkiss guns were hidden in their canvas jackets, the\nMaxims were lashed to the side of the bridge out of sight, and\nLieutenant Augustus Tibbetts, who sprawled in a big wicker-work chair\nwith an illustrated paper on his knees, a nasal-toned phonograph at his\nfeet, and a long glass of lemon squash at his elbow, had little to do\nbut pass the pleasant hours in the most pleasant occupation he could\nconceive, which was the posting of a diary, which he hoped on some\nfuture occasion to publish.\n\nA shout, quick and sharp, brought him to his feet, a stiffly\noutstretched hand pointed to the waters.\n\n\"What the dooce----\" demanded Bones indignantly, and looked over the\nside.... He saw the pitiful thing that rolled slowly in the swift\ncurrent, and the homely face of Bones hardened.\n\n\"Damn,\" he said, and the wheel of the _Zaire_ spun, and the little boat\ncame broadside to the stream before the threshing wheel got purchase on\nthe water.\n\nIt was Bones' sinewy hand that gripped the poor arm and brought the body\nto the side of the canoe into which he had jumped as the boat came\nround.\n\n\"Um,\" said Bones, seeing what he saw; \"who knows this man?\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said a wooding man, \"this is B'chumbiri who was mad, and he\nlived in the village near by.\"\n\n\"There will we go,\" said Bones, very gravely.\n\nNow all the people of M'fa knew that the father of B'chumbiri and his\nuncle had put away the tiresome youth with his headache and his silly\ntalk, and when there came news that the _Zaire_ was beating her way to\nthe village there was a hasty _likambo_ of the eldermen.\n\n\"Since this is neither Sandi nor M'ilitani who comes,\" said the chief,\nan old man, N'jela (\"the Bringer\"), \"but Moon-in-the-Eye, who is a\nchild, let us say that B'chumbiri fell into the water so that the\ncrocodiles had him, and if he asks us who slew B'chumbiri--for it may be\nthat he knows--let none speak, and afterwards we will tell M'ilitani\nthat we did not understand him.\"\n\nWith this arrangement all agreed; for surely here was a palaver not to\nbe feared.\n\nBones came with his escort of Houssas.\n\nFrom the dark interiors of thatched huts men and women watched his thin\nfigure going up the street, and laughed.\n\nNor did they laugh softly. Bones heard the chuckles of unseen people,\ndivined that contempt, and his lips trembled. He felt an immense\nloneliness--all the weight of government was pressed down upon his head,\nit overwhelmed, it smothered him.\n\nYet he kept a tight hold upon himself, and by a supreme effort of will\nshowed no sign of his perturbation.\n\nThe palaver was of little value to Bones; the village was blandly\ninnocent of murder or knowledge of murder. More than this, all men\nstoutly swore that the thing that lay upon the foreshore for\nidentification, surrounded by a crowd of frowning and frightened little\nboys lured by the very gruesomeness of the spectacle, was unknown, and\nlaughed openly at the suggestion that it was B'chumbiri, who (said they)\nhad gone a Journey into the forest.\n\nThere was little short of open mockery and defiance when they pointed\nout certain indications that went to prove that this man was not of the\nAkasava, but of the higher Isisi.\n\nSo Bones' visit was fruitless.\n\nHe dismissed the palaver and walked back to his ship, and worked the\nriver, village by village, with no more satisfactory result. That night\nin the little town of M'fa there was a dance and a jubilation to\ncelebrate the cunning of a people who had outwitted and overawed the\nlords of the land, but the next day came Bosambo, who had established a\nsystem of espionage more far-reaching, and possibly more effective, than\nthe service which the Government had instituted.\n\nLiberties they might take with Bones; but they sat discomforted in\npalaver before this alien chief, swathed in monkey tails, his shield in\none hand, and his bunch of spears in the other.\n\n\"All things I know,\" said Bosambo, when they told him what they had to\ntell, \"and it has come to me that you have spoken lightly of Tibbetti,\nwho is my friend and my master, and is well beloved of Sandi. Also they\ntell me that you smiled at him. Now I tell you there will come a day\nwhen you will not smile, and that day is near at hand.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said the chief, \"he made with us a foolish palaver, believing\nthat we had put away B'chumbiri.\"\n\n\"And he shall return to that foolish palaver,\" said Bosambo grimly, \"and\nif he goes away unsatisfied, behold I will come, and I will take your\nold men, and I will hang them by hooks into a tree and roast their feet.\nFor if there is no Sandi and no law, behold I am Sandi and I law, doing\nthe will of a certain bearded king, Togi-tani.\"\n\nHe left the village of M'fa a little unhappy for the space of a day,\nwhen, native-like, they forgot all that he had said.\n\nIn the meantime, up and down the river went Bones, palavers which lasted\nfrom sunrise to sunset being his portion.\n\nHe had in his mind one vital fact, that for the honour of his race and\nfor the credit of his administration he must bring to justice the man\nwho slew the thing which he had found in the river. Chiefs and elders\nmet him with scarcely concealed scorn, and waited expectantly to hear\nhis strong, foreign language. But in this they were disappointed, for\nBones spoke nothing but the language of the river, and little of it.\n\nHe went on board the _Zaire_ on the ninth night after his discovery,\ndispirited and sick at heart.\n\n\"It seems to me, Ahmet,\" he said to the Houssa sergeant who stood\nwaiting silently by the table where his meagre dinner was laid, \"that no\nman speaks the truth in this cursed land, and that they do not fear me\nas they fear Sandi.\"\n\n\"Lord, it is so,\" said Ahmet; \"for, as your lordship knows, Sandi was\nvery terrible, and then, O Tibbetti, he is an older man, very wise in\nthe ways of these people, and very cunning to see their heart. All great\ntrees grow slowly, O my lord! and that which springs up in a night dies\nin a day.\"\n\nBones pondered this for a while, then:\n\n\"Wake me at dawn,\" he said. \"I go back to M'fa for the last palaver, and\nif this palaver be a bad one, be sure you shall not see my face again\nupon the river.\"\n\nBones spoke truly, his resignation, written in his sprawling hand, lay\nenveloped and sealed in his cabin ready for dispatch. He stopped his\nsteamer at a village six miles from M'fa, and sent a party of Houssas to\nthe village with a message.\n\nThe chief was to summon all eldermen, and all men responsible to the\nGovernment, the wearers of medals and the holders of rights, all landmen\nand leaders of hunters, the captains of spears, and the first headmen.\nEven to the witch doctors he called together.\n\n\"O soldier!\" said the chief, dubiously, \"what happens to me if I do not\nobey his commands? For my men are weary, having hunted in the forest,\nand my chiefs do not like long palavers concerning law.\"\n\n\"That may be,\" said Ahmet, calmly. \"But when my lord calls you to\npalaver you must obey, otherwise I take you, I and my strong men, to the\nVillage of Irons, there to rest for a while to my lord's pleasure.\"\n\nSo the chief sent messengers and rattled his _lokali_ to some purpose,\nbringing headmen and witch doctors, little and great chiefs, and\nspearmen of quality, to squat about the palaver house on the little hill\nto the east of the village.\n\nBones came with an escort of four men. He walked slowly up the cut steps\nin the hillside and sat upon the stool to the chief's right; and no\nsooner had he seated himself than, without preliminary, he began to\nspeak. And he spoke of Sanders, of his splendour and his power; of his\nlove for all people and his land, and also M'ilitani, who these men\nrespected because of his devilish blue eyes.\n\nAt first he spoke slowly, because he found a difficulty in breathing,\nand then as he found himself, grew more and more lucid and took a larger\ngrasp of the language.\n\n\"Now,\" said he, \"I come to you, being young in the service of the\nGovernment, and unworthy to tread in my lord Sandi's way. Yet I hold the\nlaws in my two hands even as Sandi held them, for laws do not change\nwith men, neither does the sun change whatever be the land upon which\nit shines. Now, I say to you and to all men, deliver to me the slayer of\nB'chumbiri that I may deal with him according to the law.\"\n\nThere was a dead silence, and Bones waited.\n\nThen the silence grew into a whisper, from a whisper into a babble of\nsuppressed talk, and finally somebody laughed. Bones stood up, for this\nwas his supreme moment.\n\n\"Come out to me, O killer!\" he said softly, \"for who am I that I can\ninjure you? Did I not hear some voice say _g'la_, and is not _g'la_ the\nname of a fool? O, wise and brave men of the Akasava who sit there\nquietly, daring not so much as to hit a finger before one who is a\nfool!\"\n\nAgain the silence fell. Bones, his helmet on the back of his head, his\nhands thrust into his pockets, came a little way down the hill towards\nthe semi-circle of waiting eldermen.\n\n\"O, brave men!\" he went on, \"O, wonderful seeker of danger! Behold! I,\n_g'la_, a fool, stand before you and yet the killer of B'chumbiri sits\ntrembling and will not rise before me, fearing my vengeance. Am I so\nterrible?\"\n\nHis wide open eyes were fixed upon the uncle of B'chumbiri, and the old\nman returned the gaze defiantly.\n\n\"Am I so terrible?\" Bones went on, gently. \"Do men fear me when I walk?\nOr run to their huts at the sound of my puc-a-puc? Do women wring their\nhands when I pass?\"\n\nAgain there was a little titter, but M'gobo, the uncle of B'chumbiri,\ngrimacing now in his rage, was not amongst the laughers.\n\n\"Yet the brave one who slew----\"\n\nM'gobo sprang to his feet.\n\n\"Lord,\" he said harshly, \"why do you put all men to shame for your\nsport?\"\n\n\"This is no sport, M'gobo,\" answered Bones quickly. \"This is a palaver,\na killing palaver. Was it a woman who slew B'chumbiri? so that she is\nnot present at this palaver. Lo, then I go to hold council with women!\"\n\nM'gobo's face was all distorted like a man stricken with paralysis.\n\n\"Tibbetti!\" he said, \"I slew B'chumbiri--according to custom--and I will\nanswer to Sandi, who is a man, and understands such palavers.\"\n\n\"Think well,\" said Bones, deathly white, \"think well, O man, before you\nsay this.\"\n\n\"I killed him, O fool,\" said M'gobo loudly, \"though his father turned\nwoman at the last--with these hands I cut him, using two knives----\"\n\n\"Damn you!\" said Bones, and shot him dead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHamilton, so far convalescent that he could smoke a cigarette, heard the\naccount without interruption.\n\n\"So there you are, sir,\" said Bones at the side. \"An' I felt like a\njolly old murderer, but, dear old officer, what was I to do?\"\n\nStill Hamilton said nothing, and Bones shifted uncomfortably.\n\n\"For goodness gracious sake don't sit there like a bally old owl,\" he\nsaid, fretfully. \"Was I wrong?\"\n\nHamilton smiled.\n\n\"You're a jolly old commissioner, sir,\" he mimicked, \"and for two pins\nI'd mention you in dispatches.\"\n\nBones examined the piping of his khaki jacket and extracted the pins.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHE MAN WHO DID NOT SLEEP\n\n\nNo doubt whatever but that Lieutenant Tibbetts of the Houssas had a\npretty taste for romance. It led him to exercise certain latent powers\nof imagination and to garnish his voluminous correspondence with details\nof happenings which had no very solid foundation in fact.\n\nOn one occasion he had called down the heavy sarcasm of his superior\nofficer by a reference to lions--a reference which Hamilton's sister had\nseen and, in the innocence of her heart, had referred to in a letter to\nher brother.\n\nWhereupon Bones swore to himself that he would carefully avoid\ncorresponding with any person who might have the remotest acquaintance\nwith the remotest of Hamilton's relatives.\n\nEvery mail night Captain Hamilton underwent a cross-examination which at\nonce baffled and annoyed him.\n\nPicture a great room, the walls of varnished match-boarding, the bare\nfloor covered in patches by skins. There are twelve windows covered\nwith fine mesh wire and looking out to the broad verandah which runs\nround the bungalow. The furniture is mainly wicker work, a table or two\nbearing framed photographs (one has been cleared for the huge gramophone\nwhich Bones has introduced to the peaceful life of headquarters). There\nare no pictures on the walls save the inevitable five--Queen Victoria,\nKing Edward, Queen Alexandra, and in a place of honour above the door\nthe King and his Consort.\n\nA great oil lamp hangs from the centre of the boarded ceiling, and under\nthis the big solid table at either side of which two officers write\nsilently and industriously, for the morrow brings the mail boat.\n\nSilent until Bones looked up thoughtfully.\n\n\"Do you know the Gripps, of Beckstead, dear old fellow?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"None of your people know 'em?\" hopefully.\n\n\"No--how the dickens do I know?\"\n\n\"Don't get chuffy, dear old chap.\"\n\nThen would follow another silence, until----\n\n\"Do you happen to be acquainted with the Lomands of Fife?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I suppose none of your people know 'em?\"\n\nHamilton would put down his pen, resignation on his face.\n\n\"I have never heard of the Lomands--unless you refer to the Loch\nLomonds; nor to the best of my knowledge and belief are any of my\nrelations in blood or in law in any way acquainted with them.\"\n\n\"Cheer oh!\" said Bones, gratefully.\n\nAnother ten minutes, and then:\n\n\"You don't know the Adamses of Oxford, do you, sir?\"\n\nHamilton, in the midst of his weekly report, chucked down his pen.\n\n\"No; nor the Eves of Cambridge, nor the Serpents of Eton, nor the Angels\nof Harrow.\"\n\n\"I suppose----\" began Bones.\n\n\"Nor are my relations on speaking terms with them. They don't know the\nAdamses, nor the Cains, nor the Abels, nor the Moseses, nor the Noahs.\"\n\n\"That's all I wanted to know, sir,\" said an injured Bones. \"There's no\nneed to peeve, sir.\"\n\nStep by step Bones was compiling a directory of people to whom he might\nwrite without restraint, providing he avoided mythical lion hunts and\nconfined himself to anecdotes which were suggestively complimentary to\nhimself.\n\nThus he wrote to one pal of his at Biggestow to the effect that he was\nknown to the natives as \"The-Man-Who-Never-Sleeps,\" meaning thereby that\nhe was a most vigilant and relentless officer, and the recipients of\nthis information, fired with a sort of local patriotism, sent the\nremarkable statement to the _Biggestow Herald and Observer and Hindhead\nGuardian_, thereby upsetting all Bones' artful calculations.\n\n\"What the devil does 'Man-Who-Never-Sleeps' mean?\" asked a puzzled\nHamilton.\n\n\"Dear old fellow,\" said Bones, incoherently, \"don't let's discuss it ...\nI can't understand how these things get into the bally papers.\"\n\n\"If,\" said Hamilton, turning the cutting over in his hand, \"if they\ncalled you 'The-Man-Who-Jaws-So-Much-That-Nobody-Can-Sleep,' I'd\nunderstand it, or if they called you\n'The-Man-Sleeps-With-His-Mouth-Open-Emitting-Hideous-Noises,' I could\nunderstand it.\"\n\n\"The fact is, sir,\" said Bones, in a moment of inspiration, \"I'm an\nawfully light sleeper--in fact, sir, I'm one of those chaps who can get\nalong with a couple of hours' sleep--I can sleep anywhere at any\ntime--dear old Wellin'ton was similarly gifted--in fact, sir, there are\none or two points of resemblance between Wellington and I, which you\nmight have noticed, sir.\"\n\n\"Speak no ill of the dead,\" reproved Hamilton; \"beyond your eccentric\nnoses I see no points of resemblance.\"\n\nIt was on a morning following the dispatch of the mail that Hamilton\ntook a turn along the firm sands to settle in his mind the problem of a\ncertain Middle Island.\n\nMiddle Islands, that is to say the innumerable patches of land which\nsprinkle the river in its broad places, were a never-ending problem to\nSanders and his successor. Upon these Middle Islands the dead were laid\nto rest--from the river you saw the graves with fluttering ragged flags\nof white cloth planted about them--and the right of burial was a matter\nof dispute when the mainland at one side of the river was Isisi land,\nand Akasava the other. Also some of the larger Middle Islands were\ncolonized.\n\nHamilton had news of a coming palaver in relation to one of these.\n\nNow, on the river, it is customary for all who desire inter-tribal\npalavers to announce their intention loudly and insistently. And if\nSanders had no objection he made no move, if he did not think the\npalaver desirable he stopped it. It was a simple arrangement, and it\nworked.\n\nHamilton came back from his four-mile constitutional satisfied in his\nmind that the palaver should be held. Moreover, they had, on this\noccasion, asked permission. He could grant this with an easy mind, being\ndue in the neighbourhood of the disputed territory in the course of a\nweek.\n\nIt seemed that an Isisi fisherman had been spearing in Akasava waters,\nand had, moreover, settled, he and his family to the number of forty, on\nAkasava territory. Whereupon an Akasava fishing community, whose rights\nthe intruder had violated, rose up in its wrath and beat Issmeri with\nsticks.\n\nThen the king of the Isisi sent a messenger to the king of Akasava\nbegging him to stay his hand \"against my lawful people, for know this,\nIberi, that I have a thousand spears and young men eager for fire.\"\n\nAnd Iberi replied with marked unpleasantness that there were in the\nAkasava territory two thousand spears no less inclined to slaughter.\n\nIn a moment of admirable moderation, significant of the change which Mr.\nCommissioner Sanders had wrought in these warlike peoples, they accepted\nHamilton's suggestion--sent by special envoy--and held a \"small\npalaver,\" agreeing that the question of the disputed fishing ground\nshould be settled by a third person.\n\nAnd they chose Bosambo, paramount and magnificent chief of the Ochori,\nas arbitrator. Now, it was singularly unfortunate that the question was\never debatable. And yet it was, for the fishing ground in question was\noff one of the many Middle Islands. In this case the island was occupied\nby Akasava fishermen on the one shore and by the intruding Isisi on the\nother. If you can imagine a big \"Y\" and over it a little \"o\" and over\nthat again an inverted \"Y\" thus \"+\" and drawing this you prolong the\nfour prongs of the Y's, you have a rough idea of the topography of the\nplace. To the left of the lower \"Y\" mark the word \"Isisi,\" to the right\nthe word \"Akasava\" until you reach a place where the two right hand\nprongs meet, and here you draw a line and call all above it \"Ochori.\"\nThe \"o\" in the centre is the middle island--set in a shallow lake\nthrough which the river (the stalk, of the Y's) runs.\n\nBosambo came down in state with ten canoes filled with counsellors and\nbodyguard. He camped on the disputed ground, and was met thereon by the\nchiefs affected.\n\n\"O, Iberi and T'lingi!\" said he, as he stepped ashore, \"I come in peace,\nbringing all my wonderful counsellors, that I may make you as brothers,\nfor as you know I have a white man's way of knowing all their magic, and\nbeing a brother in blood to our Lord Tibbetti, Moon-in-the-Eye.\"\n\n\"This we know, Bosambo,\" said Iberi, looking askance at the size of\nBosambo's retinue, \"and my stomach is proud that you bring so vast an\narmy of high men to us, for I see that you have brought rich food for\nthem.\"\n\nHe saw nothing of the sort, but he wanted things made plain at the\nbeginning.\n\n\"Lord Iberi,\" said Bosambo, loftily, \"I bring no food, for that would\nhave been shameful, and men would have said: 'Iberi is a mean man who\nstarves the guests of his house.' But only one half of my wise people\nshall sit in your huts, Iberi, and the other half will rest with T'lingi\nof the Akasava, and feed according to law. And behold, chiefs and\nheadmen, I am a very just man not to be turned this way or that by the\ngiving of gifts or by kindness shown to my people. Yet my heart is so\nhuman and so filled with tenderness for my people, that I ask you not to\nfeed them too richly or give them presents of beauty, lest my noble mind\nbe influenced.\"\n\nWhereupon his forces were divided, and each chief ransacked his land for\ndelicacies to feed them.\n\nIt was a long palaver--too long for the chiefs.\n\nWas the island Akasava or Isisi? Old men of either nation testified with\noaths and swearings of death and other high matters that it was both.\n\nFrom dawn to sunset Bosambo sat in the thatched palaver house, and on\neither side of him was a brass pot into which he tossed from time to\ntime a grain of corn.\n\nAnd every grain stood for a successful argument in favour of one or the\nother of the contestants--the pot to the right being for the Akasava,\nand that to the left for the Isisi.\n\nAnd the night was given up to festivity, to the dancing of girls and the\ntelling of stories and other noble exercises.\n\nOn the tenth day Iberi met T'lingi secretly.\n\n\"T'lingi,\" said Iberi, \"it seems to me that this island is not worth the\nkeeping if we have to feast this thief Bosambo and search our lands for\nhis pleasure.\"\n\n\"Lord Iberi,\" agreed his rival, \"that is also in my mind--let us go to\nthis robber of our food and say the palaver shall finish to-morrow, for\nI do not care whether the island is yours or mine if we can send Bosambo\nback to his land.\"\n\n\"You speak my mind,\" said Iberi, and on the morrow they were blunt to\nthe point of rudeness.\n\nWhereupon Bosambo delivered judgment.\n\n\"Many stories have been told,\" said he, \"also many lies, and in my\nwisdom I cannot tell which is lie and which is truth. Moreover, the\ngrains of corn are equal in each pot. Now, this I say, in the name of\nmy uncle Sandi, and my brother Tibbetti (who is secretly married to my\nsister's cousin), that neither Akasava nor Isisi shall sit in this\nisland for a hundred years.\"\n\n\"Lord, you are wise,\" said the Akasava chief, well satisfied, and Iberi\nwas no less cheered, but asked: \"Who shall keep this island free from\nAkasava or Isisi? For men may come and there will be other palavers and\nperhaps fighting?\"\n\n\"That I have thought of,\" said Bosambo, \"and so I will raise a village\nof my own people on this island, and put a guard of a hundred men--all\nthis I will do because I love you both--the palaver is finished.\"\n\nHe rose in his stately way, and with his drums beating and the bright\nspearheads of his young men a-glitter in the evening sunlight, embarked\nin his ten canoes, having expanded his territory without loss to himself\nlike the Imperialist he was.\n\nFor two days the chiefs of the Akasava and the Isisi were satisfied with\nthe justice of an award which robbed them both without giving an\nadvantage to either. Then an uneasy realization of their loss dawned\nupon them. Then followed a swift exchange of messages and Bosambo's\ncolonization scheme was unpleasantly checked.\n\nHamilton was on the little lake which is at the end of the N'gini River\nwhen he heard of the trouble, and from the high hills at the far end of\nthe lake sent a helio message staring and blinking across the waste.\n\nBones, fishing in the river below Ikan, picked up the instructions, and\nwent flying up the river as fast as the new naphtha launch could carry\nhim.\n\nHe arrived in time to cover the shattered remnants of Bosambo's fleet as\nthey were being swept northward from whence they came.\n\nBones went inshore to the island, the water jacket of a Maxim gun\nexposed over the bow, but there was no opposition.\n\n\"What the dooce is all this about--hey?\" demanded Lieutenant Tibbetts\nfiercely, and Iberi, doubly uneasy at the sound of an unaccustomed\nlanguage, stood on one leg in his embarrassment.\n\n\"Lord, the thief Bosambo----\" he began, and told the story.\n\n\"Lord,\" he concluded humbly, \"I say all this though Bosambo is your\nrelation since you have secretly married his sister's cousin.\"\n\nWhereupon Bones went very red and stammered and spluttered in such a way\nthat the chief knew for sure that Bosambo had spoken the truth.\n\nBones, as I have said before, was no fool. He confirmed Bosambo's order\nfor the evacuation of the island, but left a Houssa guard to hold it.\n\nThen he hurried north to the Ochori.\n\nBosambo formed his royal procession, but there was no occasion for it,\nfor Bones was in no processional mood.\n\n\"What the dooce do you mean, sir?\" demanded a glaring and threatening\nBones, his helmet over his neck, his arms akimbo. \"What do you mean,\nsir, by saying I'm married to your infernal aunt?\"\n\n\"Sah,\" said Bosambo, virtuous and innocent, \"I no savvy you--I no\ncompreney, sah! You lib for my house--I give you fine t'ings. I make um\nmoosic, sah----\"\n\n\"You're a jolly old rotter, Bosambo!\" said Bones, shaking his finger in\nthe chief's face. \"I could punish you awfully for telling wicked\nstories, Bosambo. I'm disgusted with you, I am indeed.\"\n\n\"Lord who never sleeps,\" began Bosambo, humbly.\n\n\"Hey?\"\n\nBones stared at the other in amazement, suspicion, hope, and\ngratification in his face.\n\n\"O, Bosambo,\" said he mildly, and speaking in the native tongue, \"why do\nyou call me by that name?\"\n\nNow, Bosambo in his innocence had used a phrase (_M'wani-m'wani_) which\nsignifies \"the sleepless one,\" and also stands in the vernacular for\n\"busy-body,\" or one who is eternally concerned with other people's\nbusiness.\n\n\"Lord,\" said Bosambo, hastily, \"by this name are you known from the\nmountains to the sea. Thus all men speak of you, saying: 'This is he who\ndoes not sleep but watches all the time.'\"\n\nBones was impressed, he was flattered, and he ran his finger between the\ncollar of his uniform jacket and his scraggy neck as one will do who is\nembarrassed by praise and would appear unconcerned under the ordeal.\n\n\"So men call me, Bosambo,\" said he carelessly \"though my lord M'ilitani\ndoes not know this--therefore in the day when M'ilitani comes, speak of\nme as _M'wani-m'wani_ that he may know of whom men speak when they say\n'the sleepless one.'\"\n\nEverybody knows that _Cala cala_ great chiefs had stored against the\nhour of their need certain stocks of ivory.\n\nDead ivory it is called because it had been so long cut, but good cow\nivory, closer in grain than the bull elephant brought to the hunter,\nmore turnable, and of greater value.\n\nThere is no middle island on the river about which some legend or buried\ntreasure does not float.\n\nHamilton, hurrying forward to the support of his second-in-command,\nstopped long enough to interview two sulky chiefs.\n\n\"What palaver is this?\" he demanded of Iberi, \"that you carry your\nspears to a killing? For is not the river big enough for all, and are\nthere no burying-places for your old men that you should fight so\nfiercely?\"\n\n\"Lord,\" confessed Iberi, \"upon that island is a treasure which has been\nhidden from the beginning of time, and that is the truth--N'Yango!\"\n\nNow, no man swears by his mother unless he is speaking straightly, and\nHamilton understood.\n\n\"Never have I spoken of this to the Chief of the Isisi,\" Iberi went on,\n\"nor he to me, yet we know because of certain wise sayings that the\ntreasure stays and young men of our houses have searched very diligently\nthough secretly. Also Bosambo knows, for he is a cunning man, and when\nwe found he had put his warriors to the seeking we fought him, lord, for\nthough the treasure may be Isisi or Akasava, of this I am sure it is not\nof the Ochori.\"\n\nHamilton came to the Ochori city to find a red-eyed Bones stalking\nmajestically up and down the beach.\n\n\"What is the matter with you?\" demanded Hamilton. \"Fever?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" replied Bones, huskily; but with a fine carelessness.\n\n\"You look as if you hadn't had a sleep for months,\" said Hamilton.\n\nBones shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Dear old fellow,\" said he, \"it isn't for nothing that I'm called 'the\nsleepless one'--don't make sceptical noises, dear old officer, but\npursue your inquiries among the indigenous natives, especially\nBosambo--an hour is all I want--just a bit of a snooze and a bath and\nI'm bright an' vigilant.\"\n\n\"Take your hour,\" said Hamilton briefly. \"You'll need it.\"\n\nHis interview with Bosambo was short and, for Bosambo, painful.\nNevertheless he unbent in the end to give the chief a job after his\nheart.\n\nLaunch and steamer turned their noses down the stream, and at sunset\ncame to the island. In the morning, Hamilton conducted a search which\nextended from shore to shore and he came upon the cairn unexpectedly\nafter a two hours' search. He uncovered two tons of ivory, wrapped in\nrotten native cloth.\n\n\"There will be trouble over this,\" he said, thoughtfully, surveying the\nyellow tusks. \"I'll go downstream to the Isisi and collect information,\nunless these beggars can establish their claim we will bag this lot for\ngovernment.\"\n\nHe left Bones and one orderly on the island.\n\n\"I shall be gone two days,\" he said. \"I must send the launch to bring\nIberi to me; keep your eyes peeled.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Bones, blinking and suppressing a yawn with difficulty, \"you\ncan trust the sleepless one.\"\n\nHe had his tent pitched before the cairn, and in the shade of a great\ngum he seated himself in his canvas chair.... He looked up and struggled\nto his feet. He was half dead with weariness, for the whole of the\nprevious night, while Bosambo snored in his hut, Bones, pinching\nhimself, had wandered up and down the street of the city qualifying for\nhis title.\n\nNow, as he rose unsteadily to his feet, it was to confront\nBosambo--Bosambo with four canoes grounded on the sandy beach of the\nisland.\n\n\"Hello, Bosambo!\" yawned Bones.\n\n\"O Sleepless One,\" said Bosambo humbly, \"though I came in silence yet\nyou heard me, and your bright eyes saw me in the little-light.\"\n\n\"Little-light\" it was, for the sun had gone down.\n\n\"Go now, Bosambo,\" said Bones, \"for it is not lawful that you should be\nhere.\"\n\nHe looked around for Ahmet, his orderly, but Ahmet was snoring like a\npig.\n\n\"Lord, that I know,\" said Bosambo, \"yet I came because my heart is sad\nand I have sorrow in my stomach. For did I not say that you had married\nmy aunt?\"\n\n\"Now listen whilst I tell you the full story of my wickedness, and of my\naunt who married a white lord----\"\n\nBones sat down in his chair and laid back his head, listening with\nclosed eyes.\n\n\"My aunt, O Sleepless One,\" began Bosambo, and Bones heard the story in\nfragments. \"... Coast woman ... great lord ... fine drier of cloth....\"\n\nBosambo droned on in a monotonous tone, and Bones, open-mouthed, his\nhead rolling from side to side, breathed regularly.\n\nAt a gesture from Bosambo, the man who sat in the canoe slipped lightly\nashore. Bosambo pointed to the cairn, but he himself did not move, nor\ndid he check his fluent narrative.\n\nWorking with feverish, fervent energy, the men of Bosambo's party loaded\nthe great tusks in the canoes. At last all the work was finished and\nBosambo rose.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Wake up, Bones.\"\n\nLieutenant Tibbetts stumbled to his feet glaring and grimacing wildly.\n\n\"Parade all correct, sir,\" he said, \"the mail boat has just come in, an'\nthere's a jolly old salmon for supper.\"\n\n\"Wake up, you dreaming devil,\" said Hamilton.\n\nBones looked around. In the bright moonlight he saw the _Zaire_ moored\nto the shelving beach, saw Hamilton, and turned his head to the empty\ncairn.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" he gasped.\n\n\"O Sleepless One!\" said Hamilton softly, \"O bright eyes!\"\n\nBones went blundering to the cairn, made a closer inspection, and came\nslowly back.\n\n\"There's only one thing for me to do, sir,\" he said, saluting. \"As an\nofficer an' a gentleman, I must blow my brains out.\"\n\n\"Brains!\" said Hamilton scornfully.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"As a matter of fact I sent Bosambo to collect the ivory which I shall\ndivide amongst the three chiefs--it's perished ivory, anyhow; and he had\nmy written authority to take it, but being a born thief he preferred to\nsteal it; you'll find it stacked in your cabin, Bones.\"\n\n\"In my cabin, sir!\" said an indignant Bones; \"there isn't room in my\ncabin, sir. How the dickens am I going to sleep?\"\n\n\n                    THE END\n\n\n\n\n POPULAR NOVELS\n\n BY\n\n EDGAR WALLACE\n\n PUBLISHED BY\n\n WARD, LOCK & CO., LIMITED.\n\n _In Various Editions_.\n\n SANDERS OF THE RIVER\n BONES\n BOSAMBO OF THE RIVER\n BONES IN LONDON\n THE KEEPERS OF THE KING'S PEACE\n THE COUNCIL OF JUSTICE\n THE DUKE IN THE SUBURBS\n THE PEOPLE OF THE RIVER\n DOWN UNDER DONOVAN\n PRIVATE SELBY\n THE ADMIRABLE CARFEW\n THE MAN WHO BOUGHT LONDON\n THE JUST MEN OF CORDOVA\n THE SECRET HOUSE\n KATE, PLUS TEN\n LIEUTENANT BONES\n THE ADVENTURES OF HEINE\n JACK O' JUDGMENT\n THE DAFFODIL MYSTERY\n THE NINE BEARS\n THE BOOK OF ALL POWER\n MR.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
