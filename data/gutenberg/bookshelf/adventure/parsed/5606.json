I fell in a sort of way\nin love with her, and that led to opportunity.\n\nShe never made any secret of the scorn with which she regards those\nwho singe wings at her flame.  Rather she boasts of it with\nlimit-overreaching epithets.  Her respect is reserved for those rare\nmen and women who can meet her in unfair fight and, if not defeat\nher, then come close to it.  She asks no concessions on account of\nsex.  Men's passions are but weapons forged for her necessity;  and\nas for genuine love-affairs, like Cleopatra, she had but two, and the\nsecond ended in disaster to herself.  This tale is of the first one that\nsucceeded, although fraught with discontent for certain others.\n\nThe second affair came close to whelming thrones, and I wrote of that\nin another book with an understanding due, as I have said, to opportunity,\nand with a measure of respect that pleased her.\n\nShe is habitually prompt and generous with her rewards, if far-seeing\nin bestowal of them.  So, during the days of her short political eclipse\nthat followed in a palace that had housed a hundred kings, I saw her\nalmost daily in a room--her holy of holies--where the gods of ancient\nIndia were depicted in three primal colors working miracles all over\nthe walls and where, if governments had only known it, she was already\nagain devising plans to set the world on fire.\n\nThere, amid an atmosphere of Indian scents and cigarette smoke,\nshe talked and I made endless notes, while now and then, when she\nwas meditative, her maids sang to an accompaniment of rather\nmelancholy wooden flutes.  But whenever I showed a tendency to\nmuse she grew indignant.\n\n\"Of what mud are you building castles now?  Set down my thoughts\nnot yours,\" she insisted, \"if your tale is to be worth the pesa.\"\n\nBy that she referred to the custom of all Eastern story-tellers to stop at\nthe exciting moment and take up a collection of the country's smallest\ncopper coins before finishing the tale.  But the reference was double-edged.\nA penny for my thoughts, a penny for the West's interpretation of the\nEast was what she had in mind.\n\nNevertheless, as it is to the West that the story must appeal it has seemed\nwiser to remove it from her lips and so transpose that, though it loses\nin lore unfortunately, it does gain something of directness and simplicity.\nHer satire, and most of her metaphor if always set down as she phrased it,\nwould scandalize as well as puzzle Western ears.\n\nThis tale is of her youth, but Yasmini's years have not yet done more\nthan ripen her.  In a land where most women shrivel into early age she\ncontinues, somewhere perhaps a little after thirty, in the bloom of health\nand loveliness, younger in looks and energy than many a Western girl\nof twenty-five.  For she is of the East and West, very terribly endowed\nwith all the charms of either and the brains of both.\n\nHer quick wit can detect or invent mercurial Asian subterfuge as swiftly\nas appraise the rather glacial drift of Western thought;  and the wisdom\nof both East and West combines in her to teach a very nearly total\nincredulity in human virtue.  Western morals she regards as humbug,\nneither more nor less.\n\nIn virtue itself she believes, as astronomers for example believe in the\nprecession of the equinox;  but that the rank and file of human beings,\nand especially learned human beings, have attained to the very vaguest\nunderstanding of it she scornfully disbelieves.  And with a frankness\nsimply Gallic in its freedom from those thought-conventions with which\nso many people like to deceive themselves she deals with human nature\non what she considers are its merits.  The result is sometimes very\ndisconcerting to the pompous and all the rest of the host of self-deceived,\nbut usually amusing to herself and often profitable to her friends.\n\nHer ancestry is worth considering, since to that she doubtless owes a\ngood proportion of her beauty and ability.  On her father's side she is\nRajput, tracing her lineage so far back that it becomes lost at last in\nfabulous legends of the Moon (who is masculine, by the way, in Indian\nmythology).  All of the great families of Rajputana are her kin, and all\nthe chivalry and derring-do of that royal land of heroines and heroes is\npart of her conscious heritage.\n\nHer mother was Russian.  On that side, too, she can claim blood royal,\nnot devoid of at least a trace of Scandinavian, betrayed by glittering\ngolden hair and eyes that are sometimes the color of sky seen over\nHimalayan peaks, sometimes of the deep lake water in the valleys.  But\nvery often her eyes seem so full of fire and their color is so baffling that\na legend has gained currency to the effect that she can change their\nhue at will.\n\nHow a Russian princess came to marry a Rajput king is easier to understand\nif one recalls the sinister designs of Russian statecraft in the days when\nIndia and \"warm sea-water\" was the great objective.  The oldest, and\nsurely the easiest, means of a perplexed diplomacy has been to send\na woman to undermine the policy of courts or steal the very consciences\nof kings.  Delilah is a case in point.  And in India, where the veil and the\nrustling curtain and religion hide woman's hand without in the least\nsuppressing her, that was a plan too easy of contrivance to be overlooked.\n\nIn those days there was a prince in Moscow whose public conduct so\nembittered his young wife, and so notoriously, that when he was found\none morning murdered in his bed suspicion rested upon her.  She was\ntried in secret, as the custom was, found guilty and condemned to death.\nThen, on the strength of influence too strong for the czar, the sentence\nwas commuted to the far more cruel one of life imprisonment in the\nSiberian mines.  While she awaited the dreaded march across Asia in\nchains a certain proposal was made to the Princess Sonia Omanoff,\nand no one who knew anything about it wondered that she accepted\nwithout much hesitation.\n\nLess than a month after her arrest she was already in Paris, squandering\npaper rubles in the fashionable shops.  And at the Russian Embassy\nin Paris she made the acquaintance of the very first of the smaller Indian\npotentates who made the \"grand tour.\"  Traveling abroad has since\nbecome rather fashionable, and is even encouraged by the British-Indian\nGovernment because there is no longer any plausible means of preventing it;\nbut Maharajah Bubru Singh was a pioneer, who dared greatly, and had\nhis way even against the objections of a high commissioner.  In addition\nhe had had to defy the Brahman priests who, all unwilling, are the strong\nsupports of alien overrule;  for they are armed with the iron-fanged laws\nof caste that forbid crossing the sea, among innumerable other things.\n\nPerhaps there was a hint of moral bravery behind the warrior eyes that\nwas enough in itself and she really fell in love at first sight, as men said.\nBut the secret police of Russia were at her elbow, too, hinting that only\none course could save her from extradition and Siberian mines.  At any\nrate she listened to the Rajah's wooing;  and the knowledge that he had\na wife at home already, a little past her prime perhaps and therefore\nhandicapped in case of rivalry, but never-the-less a prior wife, seems\nto have given her no pause.  The fact that the first wife was childless\ndoubtless influenced Bubru Singh.\n\nThey even say she was so far beside herself with love for him that she\nwould have been satisfied with the Gandharva marriage ceremony sung\nby so many Rajput poets, that amounts to little more than going off alone\ntogether.  But the Russian diplomatic scheme included provision for the\nmaharajah of a wife so irrevocably wedded that the British would not be\nable to refuse her recognition.  So they were married in the presence\nof seven witnesses in the Russian Embassy, as the records testify.\n\nAfter that, whatever its suspicions, the British Government had to admit\nher into Rajputana.  And what politics she might have played, whether\nthe Russian gray-coat armies might have encroached into those historic\nhills on the strength of her intriguing, or whether she would have seized\nthe first opportunity to avenge herself by playing Russia false,--are matters\nknown only to the gods of unaccomplished things.  For Bubru Singh,\nher maharajah, died of an accident very shortly after the birth of their\nchild Yasmini.\n\nNow law is law, and Sonia Omanoff, then legally the Princess Sonia\nSingh, had appealed from the first to Indian law and custom, so that\nthe British might have felt justified in leaving her and her infant daughter\nto its most untender mercies.  Then she would have been utterly under\nthe heel of the succeeding prince, a nephew of her husband, unenamored\nof foreigners and avowedly determined to enforce on his uncle's widow\nthe Indian custom of seclusion.\n\nBut the British took the charitable view, that covering a multitude of sins.\nIt was not bad policy to convert the erstwhile Sonia Omanoff from secret\nenemy to grateful friend, and the feat was easy.\n\nThe new maharajah, Gungadhura Singh, was prevailed on to assign an\nancient palace for the Russian widow's use;  and there, almost within\nsight of the royal seraglio from which she had been ousted, Yasmini had\nher bringing up, regaled by her mother with tales of Western outrage\nand ambition, and well schooled in all that pertained to her Eastern heritage\nby the thousand-and-one intriguers whose delight and livelihood it is to\nfish the troubled waters of the courts of minor kings.\n\nAll these things Yasmini told me in that scented chamber of another\npalace, in which a wrathful government secluded her in later years for\nits own peace as it thought, but for her own recuperation as it happened.\nShe told me many other things besides that have some little bearing\non this story but that, if all related, would crowd the book too full.  The\nreal gist of them is that she grew to love India with all her heart and India\nrepaid her for it after its own fashion, which is manyfold and marvelous.\n\nThere is no fairer land on earth than that far northern slice of Rajputana,\nnor a people more endowed with legend and the consciousness of\nancestry.  They have a saying that every Rajput is a king's son, and every\nRajputni worthy to be married to an emperor.  It was in that atmosphere\nthat Yasmini learned she must either use her wits or be outwitted, and\nwomen begin young to assert their genius in the East.  But she outstripped\nprecocity and, being Western too, rode rough-shod on convention when\nit suited her, reserving her concessions to it solely for occasions when\nthose matched the hand she held.  All her life she has had to play in a\nruthless game, but the trump that she has learned to lead oftenest is\nunexpectedness.  And now to the story.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter One\n\n\n\nRoyal Rajasthan\n\nThere is a land where no resounding street\nWith babel of electric-garish night\nAnd whir of endless wheels has put to flight\nThe liberty of leisure.  Sandaled feet\nAnd naked soles that feel the friendly dust\nGo easily along the never measured miles.\nA land at which the patron tourist smiles\nBecause of gods in whom those people trust\n(He boasting One and trusting not at all);\nA land where lightning is the lover's boon,\nAnd honey oozing from an amber moon\nIllumines footing on forbidden wall;\nWhere, 'stead of pursy jeweler's display,\nParading peacocks brave the passer-by,\nAnd swans like angels in an azure sky\nWing swift and silent on unchallenged way.\nNo land of fable!  Of the Hills I sing,\nWhose royal women tread with conscious grace\nThe peace-filled gardens of a warrior race,\nEach maiden fit for wedlock with a king,\nAnd every Rajput son so royal born\nAnd conscious of his age-long heritage\nHe looks askance at Burke's becrested page\nAnd wonders at the new-ennobled scorn.\nI sing (for this is earth) of hate and guile,\nOf tyranny and trick and broken pledge,\nOf sudden weapons, and the thrice-keen edge\nOf woman's wit, the sting in woman's smile,\nBut also of the heaven-fathomed glow,\nThe sweetness and the charm and dear delight\nOf loyal woman, humorous and right,\nPure-purposed as the bosom of the snow.\n\nNo tale, then, this of motors, but of men\nWith camels fleeter than the desert wind,\nWho come and go. So leave the West behind,\nAnd, at the magic summons of the pen\nForgetting new contentions if you will,\nTake wings, take silent wings of time untied,\nAnd see, with Fellow-friendship for your guide,\nA little how the East goes wooing still.\n\n\n\n\"Gold is where you find it.\"\n\nDawn at the commencement of hot weather in the hills if not the loveliest\nof India's wealth of wonders (for there is the moon by night) is fair\npreparation for whatever cares to follow.  There is a musical silence cut\nof which the first voices of the day have birth;  and a half-light holding\nin its opalescence all the colors that the day shall use;  a freshness and\nserenity to hint what might be if the sons of men were wise enough;\nand beauty unbelievable.  The fortunate sleep on roofs or on verandas,\nto be ready for the sweet cool wind that moves in advance of the rising\nsun, caused, as some say, by the wing-beats of departing spirits of the night.\n\nSo that in that respect the mangy jackals, the monkeys, and the chandala\n(who are the lowest human caste of all and quite untouchable by the\nother people the creator made) are most to be envied;  for there is no\nstuffy screen, and small convention, between them and enjoyment of\nthe blessed air.\n\nNext in order of defilement to the sweepers,--or, as some particularly\nrighteous folk with inside reservations on the road to Heaven firmly insist,\neven beneath the sweepers, and possibly beneath the jackals--come\nthe English, looking boldly on whatever their eyes desire and tasting\nout of curiosity the fruit of more than one forbidden tree, but obsessed\nby an amazing if perverted sense of duty.  They rule the land, largely\nby what they idolize as \"luck,\" which consists of tolerance for things they\ndo not understand.  Understanding one another rather well, they are\nmore merciless to their own offenders than is Brahman to chandala,\nfor they will hardly let them live.  But they are a people of destiny, and\nIndia has prospered under them.\n\nIn among the English something after the fashion of grace notes in the\nbars of music--enlivening, if sharp at times--come occasional Americans,\nturning up in unexpected places for unusual reasons, and remaining--\nbecause it is no man's business to interfere with them.  Unlike the English,\nwho approach all quarters through official doors and never trespass\nwithout authority, the Americans have an embarrassing way of choosing\ntheir own time and step, taking officialdom, so to speak, in flank.  It is\nto the credit of the English that they overlook intrusion that they would\npunish fiercely if committed by unauthorized folk from home.\n\nSo when the Blaines, husband and wife, came to Sialpore in Rajputana\nwithout as much as one written introduction, nobody snubbed them.\nAnd when, by dint of nothing less than nerve nor more than ability to\nrecognize their opportunity, they acquired the lease of the only vacant\ncovetable house nobody was very jealous, especially when the Blaines\nproved hospitable.\n\nIt was a sweet little nest of a house with a cool stone roof, set in a rather\nlarge garden of its own on the shoulder of the steep hill that overlooks\nthe city.  A political dependent of Yasmini's father had built it as a haven\nfor his favorite paramour when jealousy in his seraglio had made peace\nat home impossible.  Being connected with the Treasury in some way,\nand suitably dishonest, he had been able to make a luxurious pleasaunce\nof it;  and he had taste.\n\nBut when Yasmini's father died and his nephew Gungadhura succeeded\nhim as maharajah he made a clean sweep of the old pension and\nemployment list in order to enrich new friends, so the little nest on the\nhill became deserted.  Its owner went into exile in a neighboring state\nand died there out of reach of the incoming politician who naturally wanted\nto begin business by exposing the scandalous remissness of his\npredecessor.  The house was acquired on a falling market by a money-lender,\nwho eventually leased it to the Blaines on an eighty per cent. basis--\na price that satisfied them entirely until they learned later about local proportion.\n\nThe front veranda faced due east, raised above the garden by an eight-foot\nwall, an ideal place for sleep because of the unfailing morning breeze.\nThe beds were set there side by side each evening, and Mrs. Blaine--\na full ten years younger than her husband--formed a habit of rising in\nthe dark and standing in her night-dress, with bare feet on the utmost\nedge of the top stone step, to watch for the miracle of morning.  She\nwas fabulously pretty like that, with her hair blowing and her young figure\noutlined through the linen;  and she was sometimes unobserved.\n\nThe garden wall, a hundred feet beyond, was of rock, two-and-a-half\nmen high, as they measure the unleapable in that distrustful land;  but\nthe Blaines, hailing from a country where a neighbor's dog and chickens\nhave the run of twenty lawns, seldom took the trouble to lock the little,\narched, iron-studded door through which the former owner had come\nand gone unobserved.  The use of an open door is hardly trespass\nunder the law of any land;  and dawn is an excellent time for the\nimpecunious who take thought of the lily how it grows in order to\noutdo Solomon.\n\nWhen a house changes hands in Rajputana there pass with it, as well\nas the rats and cobras and the mongoose, those beggars who were\nwont to plague the former owner.  That is a custom so based on ancient\nlogic that the English, who appreciate conservatism, have not even\ntried to alter it.\n\nSo when a cracked voice broke the early stillness out of shadow where\nthe garden wall shut off the nearer view, Theresa Blaine paid small\nattention to it.\n\n\"Memsahib!  Protectress of the poor!\"\n\nShe continued watching the mystery of coming light.  The ancient city's\ndomed and pointed roofs already glistened with pale gold, and a pearly\nmist wreathed the crowded quarter of the merchants.  Beyond that the\nriver, not more than fifty yards wide, flowed like molten sapphire between\nunseen banks.  As the pale stars died, thin rays of liquid silver touched\nthe surface of a lake to westward, seen through a rift between purple\nhills.  The green of irrigation beyond the river to eastward shone like\nsquare-cut emeralds, and southward the desert took to itself all imaginable\nhues at once.\n\n\"Colorado!\" she said then.  \"And Arizona!  And Southern California!\nAnd something added that I can't just place!\"\n\n\"Sin's added by the scow-load!\" growled her husband from the farther bed.\n\"Come back, Tess, and put some clothes on!\"\n\nShe turned her head to smile, but did not move away.  Hearing the man's\nvoice, the owners of other voices piped up at once from the shadow,\nall together, croaking out of tune:\n\n\"Bhig mangi shahebi!  Bhig mangi shahebi!\"  (Alms!  Alms!)\n\n\"I can see wild swans,\" said Theresa.  \"Come and look--five--six--seven\nof them, flying northward, oh, ever so high up!\"\n\n\"Put some clothes on, Tess!\"\n\n\"I'm plenty warm.\"\n\n\"Maybe.  But there's some skate looking at you from the garden.  What's\nthe matter with your kimono?\"\n\nHowever the dawn wind was delicious, and the night-gown more decent\nthan some of the affairs they label frocks.  Besides, the East is used\nto more or less nakedness and thinks no evil of it, as women learn\nquicker than men.\n\n\"All right--in a minute.\"\n\n\"I'll bet there's a speculator charging 'em admission at the gate,\" grumbled\nDick Blaine, coming to stand beside her in pajamas.  \"Sure you're right,\nTess;  those are swans, and that's a dawn worth seeing.\"\n\nHe had the deep voice that the East attributes to manliness, and the\nmuscular mold that never came of armchair criticism.  She looked like\na child beside him, though he was agile, athletic, wiry, not enormous.\n\n\"Sahib!\" resumed the voices.  \"Sahib!  Protector of the poor!\"  They\nwhined out of darkness still, but the shadow was shortening.\n\n\"Better feed 'em, Tess.  A man's starved down mighty near the knuckle\nif he'll wake up this early to beg.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.  Those are three regular bums who look on us as their preserve.\nThey enjoy the morning as much as we do.  Begging's their way of telling\npeople howdy.\"\n\n\"Somebody pays them to come,\" he grumbled, helping her into a pale\nblue kimono.\n\nTess laughed.  \"Sure!  But it pays us too.  They keep other bums away.\nI talk to them sometimes.\"\n\n\"In English?\"\n\n\"I don't think they know any.  I'm learning their language.\"\n\nIt was his turn to laugh.  \"I knew a man once who learned the gipsy bolo\non a bet.  Before he'd half got it you couldn't shoo tramps off his door-step\nwith a gun.  After a time he grew to like it--flattered him, I suppose, but\ndecent folk forgot to ask him to their corn-roasts.  Careful, Tess, or\nSialpore'll drop us from its dinner lists.\"\n\n\"Don't you believe it!  They're crazy to learn American from me, and\nto hear your cowpuncher talk.  We're social lions.  I think they like us\nas much as we like them.  Don't make that face, Dick, one maverick\nisn't a whole herd, and you can't afford to quarrel with the commissioner.\"\n\nHe chose to change the subject.\n\n\"What are your bums' names?\" he asked.\n\n\"Funny names.  Bimbu, Umra and Pinga.  Now you can see them, look,\nthe shadow's gone.  Bimbu is the one with no front teeth, Umra has only\none eye, and Pinga winks automatically.  Wait till you see Pinga smile.\nIt's diagonal instead of horizontal.  Must have hurt his mouth in an accident.\"\n\n\"Probably he and Bimbu fought and found the biting tough.  Speaking\nof dogs, strikes me we ought to keep a good big fierce one,\" be added\nsuggestively.\n\n\"No, no, Dick; there's no danger.  Besides, there's Chamu.\"\n\n\"The bums could make short work of that parasite.\"\n\n\"I'm safe enough.  Tom Tripe usually looks in at least once a day when\nyou're gone.\"\n\n\"Tom's a good fellow, but once a day--.  A hundred things might happen.\nI'd better speak to Tom Tripe about those three bums--he'll shift them!\"\n\n\"Don't, Dick!  I tell you they keep others away.  Look, here comes Chamu\nwith the chota hazri.\"\n\nClad in an enormous turban and clean white linen from head to foot, a\nstout Hindu appeared, superintending a tall meek underling who carried\nthe customary \"little breakfast\" of the country--fruit, biscuits and the\ninevitable tea that haunts all British byways.  As soon as the underling\nhad spread a cloth and arranged the cups and plates Chamu nudged\nhim into the background and stood to receive praise undivided.  The\nsalaams done with and his own dismissal achieved with proper dignity,\nChamu drove the hamal away in front of him, and cuffed him the minute\nthey were out of sight.  There was a noise of repeated blows from\naround the corner.\n\n\"A big dog might serve better after all,\" mused Tess.  \"Chamu beats\nthe servants, and takes commissions, even from the beggars.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"They told me.\"\n\n\"Um, Bing and Ping would better keep away.  There's no obligation to\ncamp here.\"\n\n\"Only, if we fired Chamu I suppose the maharajah would be offended.\nHe made such a great point of sending us a faithful servant.\"\n\n\"True.  Gungadhura Singh is a suspicious rajah.  He suspects me anyway.\nI screwed better terms out of him than the miller got from Bob White,\nand now whenever he sees me off the job he suspects me of chicanery.\nIf we fired Chamu he'd think I'd found the gold and was trying to hide it.\nSay, if I don't find gold in his blamed hills eventually--!\"\n\n\"You'll find it, Dick.  You never failed at anything you really set your heart on.\nWith your experience--\"\n\n\"Experience doesn't count for much,\" he answered, blowing at his tea\nto cool it.  \"It's not like coal or manganese.  Gold is where you find it.\nThere are no rules.\"\n\n\"Finding it's your trade.  Go ahead.\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid of that.  What eats me,\" he said, standing up and looking\ndown at her, \"is what I've heard about their passion for revenge.  Every\none has the same story.  If you disappoint them, gee whiz, look out!\nPoisoning your wife's a sample of what they'll do.  It's crossed my mind\na score of times, little girl, that you ought to go back to the States and\nwait there till I'm through--\"\n\nShe stood on tiptoe and kissed him.\n\n\"Isn't that just like a man!\"\n\n\"All the same--\"\n\n\"Go in, Dick, and get dressed, or the sun will be too high before you\nget the gang started.\"\n\nShe took his arm and they went into the house together.  Twenty minutes\nlater he rode away on his pony, looking if possible even more of an\nathlete than in his pajamas, for there was an added suggestion of\naccomplishment in the rolled-up sleeves and scarred boots laced to\nthe knee.  Their leave-taking was a purely American episode, mixed\nof comradeship, affection and just plain foolishness, witnessed by more\nwondering, patient Indian eyes than they suspected.  Every move that\neither of them made was always watched.\n\nAs a matter of fact Chamu's attention was almost entirely taken up just\nthen by the crows, iniquitous black humorists that took advantage of\nturned backs (for Tess walked beside the pony to the gate) to rifle the\nremains of chota hazri, one of them flying off with a spoon since the\nrest had all the edibles.  Chamu threw a cushion at the spoon-thief and\ncalled him \"Balibuk,\" which means eater of the temple offerings, and\nis an insult beyond price.\n\n\"That's the habit of crows,\" he explained indignantly to Tess as she\nreturned, laughing, to the veranda, picking up the cushion on her way.\n\"They are without shame. Garud, who is king of all the birds, should\nturn them into fish;  then they could swim in water and be caught with\nhooks.  But first Blaine sahib should shoot them with a shotgun.\"\n\nHaving offered that wise solution of the problem Chamu stood with fat\nhands folded on his stomach.\n\n\"The crows steal less than some people,\" Tess answered pointedly.\n\nHe preferred to ignore the remark.\n\n\"Or there might be poison added to some food, and the food left for\nthem to see,\" he suggested, whereat she astonished him, American\nwomen being even more incomprehensible than their English cousins.\n\n\"If you talk to me about poison I'll send you back to Gungadhura in\ndisgrace.  Take away the breakfast things at once.\"\n\n\"That is the hamal's business,\" he retorted pompously.  \"The maharajah\nsahib is knowing me for most excellent butler.  He himself has given\nme already very high recommendation.  Will he permit opinions of other\npeople to contradict him?\"\n\nThe words \"opinions of women\" had trembled on his lips but intuition\nsaved that day.  It flashed across even his obscene mentality that he\nmight suggest once too often contempt for Western folk who worked\nfor Eastern potentates.  It was true he regarded the difference between\na contract and direct employment as merely a question of degree,\nand a quibble in any case, and he felt pretty sure that the Blaines would\nnot risk the maharajah's unchancy friendship by dismissing himself;\nbut he suspected there were limits.  He could not imagine why, but he\nhad noticed that insolence to Blaine himself was fairly safe, Blaine being\nsuper-humanly indifferent as long as Mrs. Blaine was shown respect,\neven exceeding the English in the absurd length to which he carried it.\nIt was a mad world in Chamu's opinion.  He went and fetched the hamal,\nwho slunk through his task with the air of a condemned felon.  Tess\nsmiled at the man for encouragement, but Chamu's instant jealousy\nwas so obvious that she regretted the mistake.\n\n\"Now call up the beggars and feed them,\" she ordered.\n\n\"Feed them?  They will not eat.  It is contrary to caste.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.  They have no caste.  Bring bread and feed them.\"\n\n\"There is no bread of the sort they will eat.\"\n\n\"I know exactly what you mean.  If I give them bread there's no profit\nfor you--they'll eat it all;  but if I give them money you'll exact a commission\nfrom them of one pesa in five.  Isn't that so?  Go and bring the bread.\"\n\nHe decided to turn the set-back into at any rate a minor victory and went\nin person to the kitchen for chupatties such as the servants ate.  Then,\nreturning to the top of the steps he intimated that the earth-defilers\nmight draw near and receive largesse, contriving the impression that\nit was by his sole favor the concession was obtained.  Two of them\ncame promptly and waited at the foot of the steps, smirking and changing\nattitudes to draw attention to their rags.  Chamu tossed the bread to\nthem with expressions of disgust.  If they had cared to pretend they\nwere holy men he would have been respectful, in degree at least, but\nthese were professionals so hardened that they dared ignore the\nreligious apology, which implies throughout the length and breadth of\nIndia the right to beg from place to place.  These were not even true\nvagabonds, but rogues contented with one victim in one place as long\nas benevolence should last.\n\n\"Where is the third one?\" Tess demanded.  \"Where is Pinga?\"\n\nThey professed not to know, but she had seen all three squatting together\nclose to the little gate five minutes before.  She ordered Chamu to go\nand find the missing man and he waddled off, grumbling.  At the end\nof five minutes he returned without him.\n\n\"One comes on horseback,\" he announced, \"who gave the third beggar\nmoney, so that he now waits outside.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"Who knows?  Perhaps to keep watch.\"\n\n\"To watch for what?\"\n\n\"Who knows?\"\n\n\"Who is it on horseback?  A caller?  Some one coming for breakfast?\nYou'd better hurry.\"\n\nThe call at breakfast-time is one of the pleasantest informalities of life\nin India.  It might even be the commissioner.  Tess ran to make one\nof those swift changes of costume with which some women have the\ngift of gracing every opportunity.  Chamu waddled down the steps to\nawait with due formality, the individual, in no way resembling a British\ncommissioner, who was leisurely dismounting at the wide gate fifty yards\nto the southward of that little one the beggars used.\n\nHe was a Rajput of Rajputs, thin-wristed, thin-ankled, lean, astonishingly\nhandsome in a high-bred Northern way, and possessed of that air of\nutter self-assuredness devoid of arrogance which people seem able\nto learn only by being born to it.  His fine features were set off by a turban\nof rose-pink silk, and the only fault discoverable as he strode up the\npath between the shrubs was that his riding-boots seemed too tight\nacross the instep.  There was not a vestige of hair on his face.  He was\ncertainly less than twenty, perhaps seventeen years old, or even younger.\nAges are hard to guess in that land.\n\nTess was back on the veranda in time to receive him, with different\nshoes and stockings, and another ribbon in her hair;  few men would\nhave noticed the change at all, although agreeably conscious of the\ndaintiness.  The Rajput seemed unable to look away from her but\nignoring Chamu, as he came up the steps, appraised her inch by inch\nfrom the white shoes upward until as he reached the top their eyes met.\nChamu followed him fussily.\n\nTess could not remember ever having seen such eyes.  They were\nbaffling by their quality of brilliance, unlike the usual slumbrous Eastern\norbs that puzzle chiefly by refusal to express emotion.  The Rajput bowed\nand said nothing, so Tess offered him a chair, which Chamu drew up\nmore fussily than ever.\n\n\"Have you had breakfast?\" she asked, taking the conscious risk.  Strangers\nof alien race are not invariably good guests, however good-looking,\nespecially when one's husband is somewhere out of call.  She looked\nand felt nearly as young as this man, and had already experienced\novertures from more than one young prince who supposed he was\ndoing her an honor.  Used to closely guarded women's quarters, the\nEast wastes little time on wooing when the barriers are passed or down.\nBut she felt irresistibly curious, and after all there was Chamu.\n\n\"Thanks, I took breakfast before dawn.\"\n\nThe Rajput accepted the proffered chair without acknowledging the\nbutler's existence.  Tess passed him the big silver cigarette box.\n\n\"Then let me offer you a drink.\"\n\nHe declined both drink and cigarette and there was a minute's silence\nduring which she began to grow uncomfortable.\n\n\"I was riding after breakfast--up there on the hill where you see that\noverhanging rock, when I caught sight of you here on the veranda.\nYou, too, were watching the dawn--beautiful!  I love the dawn.  So I\nthought I would come and get to know you.  People who love the same\nthing, you know, are not exactly strangers.\"\n\nAlmost, if not quite for the first time Tess grew very grateful for Chamu,\nwho was still hovering at hand.\n\n\"If my husband had known, he would have stayed to receive you.\"\n\n\"Oh, no! I took good care for that!  I continued my ride until after I knew\nhe had gone for the day.\"\n\nThings dawn on your understanding in the East one by one, as the\nstars come out at night, until in the end there is such a bewildering\nnumber of points of light that people talk about the \"incomprehensible\nEast.\"  Tess saw light suddenly.\n\n\"Do you mean that those three beggars are your spies?\"\n\nThe Rajput nodded.  Then his bright eyes detected the instant resolution\nthat Tess formed.\n\n\"But you must not be afraid of them.  They will be very useful--often.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\nThe visitor made a gesture that drew attention to Chamu.\n\n\"Your butler knows English.  Do you know Russian?\"\n\n\"Not a word.\"\n\n\"French?\"\n\n\"Very little.\"\n\n\"If we were alone--\"\n\nTess decided to face the situation boldly.  She came from a free land,\nand part of her heritage was to dare meet any man face to face;  but\nintuition combined with curiosity to give her confidence.\n\n\"Chamu, you may go.\"\n\nThe butler waddled out of sight, but the Rajput waited until the sound\nof his retreating footsteps died away somewhere near the kitchen.  Then:\n\n\"You feel afraid of me?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not at all.  Why should I?  Why do you wish to see me alone?\"\n\n\"I have decided you are to be my friend.  Are you not pleased?\"\n\n\"But I don't know anything about you.  Suppose you tell me who you\nare and tell me why you use beggars to spy on my husband.\"\n\n\"Those who have great plans make powerful enemies, and fight against\nodds.  I make friends where I can, and instruments even of my enemies.\nYou are to be my friend.\"\n\n\"You look very young to--\"\n\nSuddenly Tess saw light again, and the discovery caused her pupils\nto contract a little and then dilate.  The Rajput noticed it, and laughed.\nThen, leaning forward:\n\n\"How did vou know I am a woman?  Tell me.  I must know.  I shall study\nto act better.\"\n\nTess leaned back entirely at her ease at last and looked up at the sky,\nrather reveling in relief and in the fun of turning the tables.\n\n\"Please tell me!  I must know!\"\n\n\"Oh, one thing and another.  It isn't easy to explain.  For one thing, your insteps.\"\n\n\"I will get other boots.  What else?  I make no lap.  I hold my hands as\na man does.  Is my voice too high--too excitable?\"\n\n\"No.  There are men with voices like yours.  There's a long golden hair\non your shoulder that might, of course, belong to some one else, but\nyour ears are pierced--\"\n\n\"So are many men's.\"\n\n\"And you have blue eyes, and long fair lashes.  I've seen occasional\nRajput men with blue eyes, too, but your teeth--much too perfect for a man.\"\n\n\"For a young man?\"\n\n\"Perhaps not.  But add one thing to another--\"\n\n\"There is something else.  Tell me!\"\n\n\"You remember when you called attention to the butler before I dismissed\nhim?  No man could do that.  You're a woman and you can dance.\"\n\n\"So it is my shoulders?  I will study again before the mirror.  Yes, I can\ndance.  Soon you shall see me.  You shall see all the most wonderful\nthings in Rajputana.\"\n\n\"But tell me about yourself,\" Tess insisted, offering the cigarettes again.\nAnd this time her guest accepted one.\n\n\"My mother was the Russian wife of Bubru Singh, who had no son.\nI am the rightful maharanee of Sialpore, only those fools of English put\nmy father's\n nephew on the throne, saying a woman can not reign.  They are no\nwiser than apes!  They have given Sialpore to Gungadhura who is a\npig and loathes them instead of to a woman who would only laugh at\nthem, and the brute is raising a litter of little pigs, so that even if he and\nhis progeny were poisoned one by one, there would always be a brat\nleft--he has so many!\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"First you must promise silence.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\"Woman to woman!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Womb to womb--heart to heart--?\"\n\n\"On my word of honor.  But I promise nothing else, remember!\"\n\n\"So speaks one whose promises are given truly!  We are already friends.\nI will tell you all that is in my heart now.\"\n\n\"Tell me your name first.\"\n\nShe was about to answer when interruption came from the direction\nof the gate.  There was a restless horse there, and a rider using resonant\nstrong language.\n\n\"Tom Tripe!\" said Tess.  \"He's earlier than usual.\"\n\nThe Rajputni smiled.  Chamu appeared through the door behind them\nwith suspicious suddenness and waddled to the gate, watched by a\npair of blue eyes that should have burned holes in his back and would\ncertainly have robbed him of all comfort had he been aware of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Two\n\nThaw on Olympus\n\nBright spurs that add their roweled row\nTo clanking saber's pride;\nFierce eyes beneath a beetling brow;\nMore license than the rules allow;\nA military stride;\nYears' use of arbitrary will\nAnd right to make or break;\nObedience of men who drill\nAnd willy nilly foot the bill\nFor authorized mistake;\nThe comfort of the self-esteem\nDeputed power brings--\nAre fickler than the shadows seem\nLess fruitful than the lotus-dream,\nAnd all of them have wings\nWhen blue eyes, laughing in your own,\nMake mockery of rules!\n\nAnd when those fustian shams have flown\nThe wise their new allegiance own,\nLeaving dead form to fools!\n\n\n\"Friendship's friendship and respect's respect, but duty's what I'm\npaid to do!\"\n\nThe man at the gate dallied to look at his horse's fetlocks.  Tess's\nstrange guest seemed in no hurry either, but her movements were as\nswift as knitting-needles.  She produced a fountain pen, and of all\nunexpected things, a Bank of India note for one thousand rupees--a\nnew one, crisp and clean.  Tess did not see the signature she scrawled\nacross its back in Persian characters, and the pen was returned to an\ninner pocket and the note, folded four times, was palmed in the subtle\nhand long before Tom Tripe came striding up the path with jingling spurs.\n\n\"Morning, ma'am,--morning!  Don't let me intrude.  I'd a little accident,\nand took a liberty.  My horse cut his fetlock--nothing serious--and I set\nyour two saises (grooms) to work on it with a sponge and water.\nTwenty minutes--will see it right as a trivet.  Then I'm off again--I've a\njob of work.\"\n\nHe stood with back to the sun and hands on his hips, looking up at Tess--\na man of fifty--a soldier of another generation, in a white uniform something\nlike a British sergeant-major's of the days before the Mutiny.  His\nmutton-chop whiskers, dyed dark-brown, were military mid-Victorian,\nas were the huge brass spurs that jingled on black riding-boots.  A\ngreat-chested, heavy-weight athletic man, a few years past his prime.\n\n\"Come up, Tom.  You're always welcome.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"  His spurs rang on the stone steps, and, since Tess was standing\nclose to the veranda rail, he turned to face her at the top.  Saluting with\nmartinet precision before removing his helmet, he did not get a clear\nview of the Rajputni.  \"As I've said many times, ma'am, the one house\nin the world where Tom Tripe may sit down with princes and commissioners.\"\n\n\"Have you had breakfast?\"\n\nHe made a wry face.\n\n\"The old story, Tom?\"\n\n\"The old story, ma'am.  A hair of the dog that bit me is all the breakfast\nI could swallow.\"\n\n\"I suppose if I don't give you one now you'll have two later?\"\n\nHe nodded. \"I must.  One now would put me just to rights and I'd eat\nat noon.  Times when I'm savage with myself, and wait, I have to have\ntwo or three before I can stomach lunch.\"\n\nShe offered him a basket chair and beckoned Chamu.\n\n\"Brandy and soda for the sahib.\"\n\n\"Thank you, ma'am!\" said the soldier piously.\n\n\"Where's your dog, Tom?\"\n\n\"Behaving himself, I hope, ma'am, out there in the sun by the gate.\"\n\n\"Call him.  He shall have a bone on the veranda.  I want him to feel as\nfriendly here as you do.\"\n\nTom whistled shrilly and an ash-hued creature, part Great Dane and\ncertainly part Rampore, came up the path like a catapulted phantom,\nmaking hardly any sound.  He stopped at the foot of the steps and\ngazed inquiringly at his master's face.\n\n\"You may come up.\"\n\nHe was an extraordinary animal, enormous, big-jowled, scarred, ungainly\nand apparently aware of it.  He paused again on the top step.\n\n\"Show your manners.\"\n\nThe beast walked toward Tess, sniffed at her, wagged his stern exactly\nonce and retired to the other end of the veranda, where Chamu, hurrying\nwith brandy gave him the widest possible berth.  Tess looked the other\nway while Tom Tripe helped himself to a lot of brandy and a little soda.\n\n\"Now get a big bone for the dog,\" she ordered.\n\n\"There is none,\" the butler answered.\n\n\"Bring the leg-of-mutton bone of yesterday.\"\n\n\"That is for soup today.\"\n\n\"Bring it!\"\n\nChamu was standing between Tom Tripe and the Rajputni, with his\nback to the latter; so nobody saw the hand that slipped something into\nthe ample folds of his sash.  He departed muttering by way of the steps\nand the garden, and the dog growled acknowledgment of the compliment.\n\nTess's Rajput guest continued to say nothing;  but made no move to go.\nIntroduction was inevitable, for it was the first rule of that house that all\nranks met there on equal terms, whatever their relations elsewhere.\nTom Tripe had finished wiping his mustache, and Tess was still wondering\njust how to manage without betraying the sex of the other or the fact\nthat she herself did not yet know her visitor's name, when Chamu returned\nwith the bone.  He threw it to the dog from a safe distance, and was\nsniffed at scornfully for his pains.\n\n\"Won't he take it?\" asked Tess.\n\n\"Not from a black man.  Bring it here, you!\"\n\nThe great brute, with a sidewise growl and glare at the butler that made\nhim sweat with fright, picked up the bone and, at a sign from his master,\nlaid it at the feet of Tess.\n\n\"Show your manners!\"\n\nOnce more he waved his stern exactly once.\n\n\"Give it to him, ma'am.\"\n\nTess touched the bone with her foot, and the dog took it away, scaring\nChamu along the veranda in front of him.\n\n\"Why don't you ever call him by name, Tom?\"\n\n\"Bad for him, ma'am.  When I say, 'Here, you!' or whistle, he obeys\nquick as lightning.  But if I say, 'Trotters!' which his name is, he knows\nhe's got to do his own thinking, and keeps his distance till he's sure\nwhat's wanted.  A dog's like an enlisted man, ma'am;  ought to be taught\nto jump at the word of command and never think for himself until you\ncall him out of the ranks by name.  Trotters understands me perfectly.\"\n\n\"Speaking of names,\" said Tess, \"I'd like to introduce you to my guest,\nTom, but I'm afraid--\"\n\n\"You may call me Gunga Singh,\" said a quiet voice full of amusement,\nand Tom Tripe started.  He turned about in his chair and for the first\ntime looked the third member of the party in the face.\n\n\"Hoity-toity!  Well, I'm jiggered!  Dash my drink and dinner, it's the princess!\"\n\nHe rose and saluted cavalierly, jocularly, yet with a deference one could\nnot doubt, showing tobacco-darkened teeth in a smile of almost\npaternal indulgence.\n\n\"So the Princess Yasmini is Gunga Singh this morning, eh?  And here's\nTom Tripe riding up-hill and down-dale, laming his horse and sweating\nthrough a clean tunic--with a threat in his ear and a reward promised\nthat he'll never see a smell of--while the princess is smoking cigarettes--\"\n\n\"In very good company!\"\n\n\"In good company, aye;  but not out of mischief, I'll be bound!  Naughty,\nnaughty!\" he said, wagging a finger at her.  \"Your ladyship'll get caught\none of these days, and where will Tom Tripe be then?  I've got my\njob to keep, you know.  Friendship's friendship and respect's respect,\nbut duty's what I'm paid to do.  Here's me, drill-master of the maharajah's\ntroops and a pension coming to me consequent on good behavior,\nwith orders to set a guard over you, miss, and prevent your going and\ncoming without his highness' leave.  And here's you giving the guard\nthe slip!  Somebody tipped his highness off, and I wish you'd heard\nwhat's going to happen to me unless I find you!\"\n\n\"You can't find me, Tom Tripe!  I'm not Yasmini today;  I'm Gunga Singh!\"\n\n\"Tut-tut, Your Ladyship;  that won't do!  I swore on my Bible oath to the\nmaharajah that I left you day before yesterday closely guarded in the\npalace across the river.  He felt easy for the first time for a week.  Now,\nbecause they're afraid for their skins, the guard all swear by Krishna\nyou were never in there, and that I've been bribed!  How did you get\nout of the grounds, miss?\"\n\n\"Climbed the wall.\"\n\n\"I might have remembered you're as active as a cat!  Next time I'll mount\na double guard on the wall, so they'll tumble off and break their necks\nif they fall asleep.  But there are no boats, for I saw to it, and the bridge\nis watched.  How did you cross the river?\"\n\n\"Swam.\"\n\n\"At night?\"\n\nThe blue eyes smiled assent.\n\n\"Missy--Your Ladyship, you mustn't do that.  Little ladies that act that\nway might lose the number of their mess.  There's crockadowndillies\nin that river--aggilators--what d'ye call the damp things?--mugger.  They\nsnap their jaws on a leg and pull you under!  The sweeter and prettier\nyou are the more they like you!  Besides, missy, princesses aren't\nsupposed to swim;  it's vulgar.\"\n\nHe contrived to look the very incarnation of offended prudery, and she\nlaughed at him with a voice like a golden bell.\n\nHe faced Tess again with a gesture of apology.\n\n\"You'll pardon me, ma'am, but duty's duty.\"\n\nTess was enjoying the play immensely, shrewdly suspecting Tom Tripe\nof more complaisance than he chose to admit to his prisoner.\n\n\"You must treat my house as a sanctuary, Tom.  Outside the garden\nwall orders I suppose are orders.  Inside it I insist all guests are free\nand equal.\"\n\nThe Princess Yasmini slapped her boot with a little riding-switch and\nlaughed delightedly.\n\n\"There, Tom Tripe!  Now what will you do?\"\n\n\"I'll have to use persuasion, miss!  Tell me how you got into your own\npalace unseen and out again with a horse without a soul knowing?\"\n\n\"'Come into my net and get caught,' said the hunter;  but the leopard is\nstill at large.  'Teach me your tracks,' begged the hunter;  but the leopard\nanswered, 'Learn them!' '\n\n\"Hell's bells!\"\n\nTom Tripe scratched his head and wiped sweat from his collar.  The\nprincess was gazing away into the distance, not apparently inclined to\ntake the soldier seriously.  Tess, wondering what her guest found\ninteresting on the horizon all of a sudden, herself picked out the third\nbeggar's shabby outline on the same high rock from which Yasmini\nhad confessed to watching before dawn.\n\n\"Will your ladyship ride home with me?\" asked Tom Tripe.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"But why not?\"\n\n\"Because the commissioner is coming and there is only one road and\nhe would see me and ask questions.  He is stupid enough not to recognize\nme, but you are too stupid to tell wise lies, and this memsahib is so\nafraid of an imaginary place called hell that I must stay and do my own--\"\n\n\"I left off believing in hell when I was ten years old,\" Tess answered.\n\n\"I hope to God you're right, ma'am!\" put in Tom Tripe piously, and both\nwomen laughed.\n\n\"Then I shall trust you and we shall always understand each other,\"\ndecided Yasmini.  \"But why will you not tell lies, if there is no hell?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I'm guilty now and then.\"\n\n\"But you are ashamed afterward?  Why?  Lies are necessary, since\npeople are such fools!\"\n\nTom Tripe interrupted, wiping the inside of his tunic collar again with a\nbig bandanna handkerchief.\n\n\"How do you know the commissioner is coming, Your Ladyship?  Phew!\nYou'd better hide!  I'll have to answer too many questions as it is.  He'd\nturn you outside in!\"\n\n\"There is no hurry,\" said Yasmini.  \"He will not be here for five minutes\nand he is a fool in any case.  He is walking his horse up-hill.\"\n\nTess too had seen the beggar on the rock remove his ragged turban,\nrewind it, and then leisurely remove himself from sight.  The system\nof signals was pretty obviously simple.  The whole intriguing East is\nsimple, if one only has simplicity enough to understand it.\n\n\"Can your horse be seen from the road?\" Yasmini asked.\n\n\"No, miss.  The saises are attending to him under the neem-trees at\nthe rear.\"\n\n\"Then ask the memsahib's permission to pass through the house and\nleave by the back way.\"\n\nTess, more amused than ever, nodded consent and clapped her hands\nfor Chamu to come and do the honors.\n\n\"I'll wait here,\" she said, \"and welcome the commissioner.\"\n\n\"But you, Your Ladyship?\" Tom Tripe scratched his head in evident\nconfusion.  \"I've got to account for you, you know.\"\n\n\"You haven't seen me.  You have only seen a man named Gunga Singh.\"\n\n\"That's all very fine, missy, but the butler--that man Chamu--he knows\nyou well enough.  He'll get the story to the maharajah's ears.\"\n\n\"Leave that to me.\"\n\n\"You dassen't trust him, miss!\"\n\nAgain came the golden laugh, expressive of the worldly wisdom of a\nthousand women, and sheer delight in it.\n\n\"I shall stay here, if the memsahib permits.\"\n\nTess nodded again.  \"The commissioner shall sit with me on the veranda,\"\nTess said.  \"Chamu will show you into the parlor.\"\n\n(The Blaines had never made the least attempt to leave behind their\nhome-grown names for things.  Whoever wanted to in Sialpore might\nhave a drawing-room, but whoever came to that house must sit in a\nparlor or do the other thing.)\n\n\"Is it possible the burra-sahib will suppose my horse is yours?\" Yasmini\nasked, and again Tess smiled and nodded.  She would know what to\nsay to any one who asked impertinent questions.\n\nYasmini and Tom Tripe followed Chamu into the house just as the\ncommissioner's horse's nose appeared past the gate-post;  and once\nbehind the curtains in the long hall that divided room from room, Tom\nTripe called a halt to make a final effort at persuasion.\n\n\"Now, missy, Your Ladyship, please!\"\n\nBut she had no patience to spare for him.\n\n\"Quick!  Send your dog to guard that door!\"\n\nTom Tripe snapped his fingers and made a motion with his right hand.\nThe dog took up position full in the middle of the passage blocking the\nway to the kitchen and alert for anything at all, but violence preferred.\nChamu, all sly smiles and effusiveness until that instant, as one who\nwould like to be thought a confidential co-conspirator, now suddenly\nrealized that his retreat was cut off.  No explanation had been offered,\nbut the fact was obvious and conscience made the usual coward of him.\nHe would rather have bearded Tom Tripe than the dog.\n\nYasmini opened on him in his own language, because there was just\na chance that otherwise Tess might overhear through the open window\nand put two and two together.\n\n\"Scullion!  Dish-breaker!  Conveyor of uncleanness!  You have a son?\"\n\n\"Truly, heavenborn.  One son, who grows into a man--the treasure of\nmy old heart.\"\n\n\"A gambler!\"\n\n\"A young man, heavenborn, who feels his manhood--now and then\ngay--now and then foolish  \"\n\n\"A budmash!\" (Bad rascal.)\n\n\"Nay, an honest one!\"\n\n\"Who borrowed from Mukhum Dass the money-lender, making\nuntrue promises?\"\n\n\"Nay, the money was to pay a debt.\"\n\n\"A gambling debt, and he lied about it.\"\n\n\"Nay, truly, heavenborn, he but promised Mukhum Dass he would repay\nthe sum with interest.\"\n\n\"Swearing he would buy with the money, two horses which Mukhum Dass\nmight seize as forfeit after the appointed time!\"\n\n\"Otherwise, heavenborn, Mukhum Dass would not have lent the money!\"\n\n\"And now Mukhum Dass threatens prison?\"\n\n\"Truly, heavenborn.  The money-lender is without shame--without mercy--\nwithout conscience.\"\n\n\"And that is why you--dog of a spying butler set to betray the sahib's\nsalt you eat--man of smiles and welcome words!--stole money from me?\nWas it to pay the debt of thy gambling brat-born-in-a-stable?\"\n\n\"I, heavenborn?  I steal from thee?  I would rather be beaten!\"\n\n\"Thou shalt be beaten, and worse, thou and thy son!  Feel in his\ncummerbund, Tom Tripe!  I saw where the money went!\"\n\nPromptly into the butler's sash behind went fingers used to delving into\nmore unmilitary improprieties than any ten civilians could think of.  Tripe\nproduced the thousand-rupee note in less than half a minute and, whether\nor not he believed it stolen, saw through the plan and laughed.\n\n\"Is my name on the back of it?\" Yasmini asked.\n\nTom Tripe displayed the signature, and Chamu's clammy face\nturned ashen-gray.\n\n\"And,\" said Yasmini, fixing Chamu with angry blue eyes, \"the commissioner\nsahib is on the veranda!  For the reputation of the English he would\ncause an example to be made of servants who steal from guests in\nthe house of foreigners.\"\n\nChamu capitulated utterly, and wept.\n\n\"What shall I do?  What shall I do?\" he demanded.\n\n\"In the jail,\" Yasmini said slowly, \"you could not spy on my doings, nor\nreport my sayings.\"\n\n\"Heavenborn, I am dumb!  Only take back the money and I am dumb\nforever, never seeing or having seen or heard either you or this sahib\nhere!  Take back the money!\"\n\nBut Yasmini was not so easily balked of her intention.\n\n\"Put his thumb-print on it, Tom Tripe, and see that he writes his name.\"\n\nThe trembling Chamu was led into a room where an ink-pot stood open\non a desk, and watched narrowly while he made a thumb-mark and\nscratched a signature.  Then:\n\n\"Take the money and pay thy puppy's debt with it.  Afterward beat the\nboy.  And see to it,\" Yasmini advised, \"that Mukhum Dass gives a receipt,\nlest he claim the debt a second time!\"\n\nSpeechless between relief, doubt and resentment Chamu hid the banknote\nin his sash and tried to feign gratitude--a quality omitted from his list of\nelements when a patient, caste-less mother brought him yelling into\nthe world.\n\n\"Go!\"\n\nTom Tripe made a sign to Trotters, who went and lay down, obviously\nbored, and Chamu departed backward, bowing repeatedly with both\nhands raised to his forehead.\n\n\"And now, Your Ladyship?\"\n\n\"Take that eater-of-all-that-is-unnamable,\" (she meant the dog), \"and\nreturn to the palace.\"\n\n\"Your Ladyship, it's all my life's worth!\"\n\n\"Tell the maharajah that you have spoken with a certain Gunga Singh,\nwho said that the Princess Yasmini is at the house of the commissioner sahib.\"\n\n\"But it's not true;  they'll--\"\n\n\"Let the commissioner sahib deny it then!  Go!\"\n\n\"But, missy--\"\n\n\"Do as I say, Tom Tripe, and when I am maharanee of Sialpore you\nshall have double pay--and a troupe of dancing girls--and a dozen horses--\nand the title of bahadur--and all the brandy you can drink.  The sepoys\nshall furthermore have modern uniforms, and you shall drill them until\nthey fall down dead.  I have promised.  Go!\"\n\nWith a wag of his head that admitted impotence in the face of woman's\nwiles Tom strode out by the back way, followed at a properly respectful\ndistance by his \"eater-of-all-that-is-unnamable.\"\n\nThen the princess walked through the parlor to the deeply cushioned\nwindow-seat, outside which the commissioner sat quite alone with Mrs. Blaine,\ntrying to pull strings whose existence is not hinted at in blue books.\nYasmini from earliest infancy possessed an uncanny gift of silence,\nsometimes even when she laughed.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Three\n\n\n\nNo Tresspass!\n\nThere's comfort in the purple creed\nOf rosary and hood;\nThere's promise in the temple gong,\nAnd hope (deferred) when evensong\nForetells a morrow's good;\nThere's rapture in the royal right\nTo lay the daily dole\nIn cash or kind at temple-door,\nSince sacrifice must go before\nThe saving of a soul.\nThe priests who plot for power now,\nThough future glory preach,\nThemselves alike the victims fall\nOf law that mesmerizes all -\nEach subject unto each -\nThough all is well if all obey\nAnd all have humble heart,\nNor dare to hold in cursed doubt\nThose gems of truth the church lets out;\nBut where's the apple-cart,\nAnd where's the sacred fiction gone,\nAnd who's to have the blame\nWhen any upstart takes a hand\nAnd, scorning what the priests have planned,\nPlays Harry with the game?\n\n\n\"Give a woman the last word always;  but be sure it is a question,\nwhich you leave unanswered.\"\n\nHe was a beau ideal commissioner.  The native newspaper said so\nwhen he first came, having painfully selected the phrase from a \"Dictionary\nOf Polite English for Public Purposes\" edited by a College graduate\nat present in the Andamans.  True, later it had called him an \"overbearing\nand insane procrastinator\"--\"an apostle of absolutism\"--and, plum of\nall literary gleanings, since it left so much to the imagination of the native\nreader,--\"laudator temporis acti.\"  But that the was because he had\nwithdrawn his private subscription prior to suspending the paper sine die\nunder paragraph so-and-so of the Act for Dealing with Sedition;  it could\nnot be held to cancel the correct first judgment, any more than the\nunmeasured early praise had offset later indiscretion.  Beau ideal must stand.\n\nIt was not his first call at the Blaines' house, although somehow or other\nhe never contrived to find Dick Blaine at home.  As a bachelor he had\nno domestic difficulties to pin him down when office work was over\nfor the morning, and, being a man of hardly more than forty, of fine\nphysique, with an astonishing capacity for swift work, he could usual\nfinish in an hour before breakfast what would have kept the routine rank\nand file of orthodox officials perspiring through the day.  That was one\nreason why he had been sent to Sialpore--men in the higher ranks,\nwith a pension due them after certain years of service, dislike being hurried.\n\nHe was a handsome man--too handsome, some said--with a profile l\nike a medallion of Mark Antony that lost a little of its strength and poise\nwhen he looked straight at you.  A commissionership was an apparent\nrise in the world;  but Sialpore has the name of being a departmental\ncul-de-sac, and they had laughed in the clubs about \"Irish promotion\"\nwithout exactly naming judge O'Mally.  (Mrs. O'Mally came from a cathedral\ncity, where distaste for the conventions is forced at high pressure from\nearly infancy.)\n\nBut there are no such things as political blind alleys to a man who is\na judge of indiscretion, provided he has certain other unusual gifts as\nwell.  Sir Roland Samson, K. C. S. I., was not at all a disappointed man,\nnor even a discouraged one.\n\nMost people were at a disadvantage coming up the path through the\nBlaines' front garden.  There was a feeling all the way of being looked\ndown on from the veranda that took ten minutes to recover from in the\nsubsequent warmth of Western hospitality.  But Samson had learned\nlong ago that appearance was all in his favor, and he reenforced it with\nbeautiful buff riding-boots that drew attention to firm feet and manly bearing.\nIt did him good to be looked at, and he felt, as a painstaking gentleman\nshould, that the sight did spectators no harm.\n\n\"All alone?\" he asked, feeling sure that Mrs. Blaine was pleased to see\nhim, and shifting the chair beside her as he sat down in order to see\nher face better.  \"Husband in the hills as usual?  I must choose a Sunday\nnext time and find him in.\"\n\nTess smiled.  She was used to the remark.  He always made it, but\nalways kept away on Sundays.\n\n\"There was a party at my house last night, and every one agreed what\nan acquisition you and your husband are to Sialpore.  You're so refreshing--\nquite different to what we're all used to.\"\n\n\"We're enjoying the novelty too--at least, Dick doesn't have much time\nfor enjoyment, but--\"\n\n\"I suppose he has had vast experience of mining?\"\n\n\"Oh, he knows his profession, and works hard.  He'll find gold where\nthere is any,\" said Tess.\n\n\"You never told me how he came to choose Sialpore as prospecting ground.\"\n\nTess recognized the prevarication instantly.  Almost the first thing Dick\nhad done after they arrived was to make a full statement of all the\ncircumstances in the commissioner's office.  However, she was not her\nhusband.  There was no harm in repetition.\n\n\"The maharajah's secretary wrote to a mining college in the States for\nthe name of some one qualified to explore the old workings in these hills.\nThey gave my husband's name among others, and he got in correspondence.\nFinally, being free at the time, we came out here for the trip, and the\nmaharajah offered terms on the spot that we accepted.  That is all.\"\n\nSamson laughed.\n\n\"I'm afraid not all.  A contract with the British Government would be kept.\nI won't say a written agreement with Gungadhura is worthless, but--\"\n\n\"Oh, he has to pay week by week in advance to cover expenses.\"\n\n\"Very wise.  But how about if you find gold?\"\n\n\"We get a percentage.\"\n\nEvery word of that, as Tess knew, the commissioner could have\nascertained in a minute from his office files.  So she was quite as much\non guard as he--quite as alert to discover hidden drifts.\n\n\"I'm afraid there'll be complications,\" he went on with an air of friendly\nfrankness.  \"Perhaps I'd better wait until I can see your husband?\"\n\n\"If you like, of course.  But he and I speak the same language.  What\nyou tell me will reach him--anything you say, just as you say it.\"\n\n\"I'd better be careful then!\" he answered, smiling.  \"Wise wives don't\nalways tell their husbands everything.\"\n\n\"I've no secrets from mine.\"\n\n\"Unusual!\" he smiled.  \"I might say obsolete!  But you Americans with\nyour reputation for divorce and originality are very old-fashioned in some\nthings, aren't you?\"\n\n\"What did you want me to tell my husband?\" countered Tess.\n\n\"I wonder if he understands how complicated conditions are here.\nFor instance, does your contract stipulate where the gold is to be found?\"\n\n\"On the maharajah's territory.\"\n\n\"Anywhere within those limits?\"\n\n\"So I understand.\"\n\n\"Is the kind of gold mentioned?\"\n\n\"How many kinds are there?\"\n\nHe gained thirty seconds for reflection by lighting a cigar, and decided\nto change his ground.\n\n\"I know nothing of geology, I'm afraid.  I wonder if your husband knows\nabout the so-called islands?  There are patches of British territory,\nadministered directly by us, within the maharajah's boundaries;  and\nlittle islands of native territory administered by the maharajah's government\nwithin the British sphere.\"\n\n\"Something like our Indian reservations, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Not exactly, but the analogy will do.  If your husband were to find gold--\nof any kind--on one of our 'islands' within the maharajah's territory, his\ncontract with the maharajah would be useless.\"\n\n\"Are the boundaries of the islands clearly marked?\"\n\n\"Not very.  They're known, of course, and recorded.  There's an old\nfort on one of them, garrisoned by a handful of British troops--a constant\nsource of heart-burn, I believe, to Gungadhura.  He can see the top of\nthe flag-staff from his palace roof;  a predecessor of mine had the pole\nlengthened, I'm told.  On the other hand, there's a very pretty little palace\nover on our side of the river with about a half square mile surrounding\nit that pertains to the native State.  Your husband could dig there, of course.\nThere's no knowing that it might not pay--if he's looking for more kinds\nof gold than one.\"\n\nTess contrived not to seem aware that she was being pumped.\n\n\"D'you mean that there might be alluvial gold down by the river?\" she asked.\n\n\"Now, now, Mrs. Blaine!\" he laughed.  \"You Americans are not so\ningenuous as you like to seem!  Do you really expect us to believe\nthat your husband's purpose isn't in fact to discover the Sialpore Treasure?\"\n\n\"I never heard of it.\"\n\n\"I suspect he hasn't told you.\"\n\n\"I'll bet with you, if you like,\" she answered.  \"Our contract against your\njob that I know every single detail of his terms with Gungadhura!\"\n\n\"Well, well,--of course I believe you, Mrs. Blaine.  We're not overheard\nare we?\"\n\nNot forgetful of the Princess Yasmini hidden somewhere in the house\nbehind her, but unsuspicious yet of that young woman's gift for garnering\nfacts, Tess stood up to look through the parlor window.  She could see\nall of the room except the rear part of the window-seat, a little more than\na foot of which was shut out of her view by the depth of the wall.  A cat,\nfor instance, could have lain there tucked among the cushions perfectly invisible.\n\n\"None of the servants is in there,\" she said, and sat down again, nodding\nin the direction of a gardener.  \"There's the nearest possible eavesdropper.\"\n\nSamson had made up his mind.  This was not an occasion to be actually\nindiscreet, but a good chance to pretend to be.  He was a judge of those matters.\n\n\"There have been eighteen rajahs of Sialpore in direct succession father\nto son,\" he said, swinging a beautiful buff-leather boot into view by\ncrossing his knee, and looking at her narrowly with the air of a man who\nunfolds confidences.  \"The first man began accumulating treasure.\nEvery single rajah since has added to it.  Each man has confided the\nsecret to his successor and to none else--father to son, you understand.\nWhen Bubru Singh, the last man, died he had no son.  The secret\ndied with him.\"\n\n\"How does anybody know that there's a secret then?\" demanded Tess.\n\n\"Everybody knows it!  The money was raised by taxes.  Minister after\nminister in turn has had to hand over minted gold to the reigning rajah--\"\n\n\"And look the other way, I suppose, while the rajah hid the stuff!\"\nsuggested Tess.\n\nSamson screwed up his face like a man who has taken medicine.\n\n\"There are dozens of ways in a native state of getting rid of men who\nknow too much.\"\n\n\"Even under British overrule?\"\n\nHe nodded. \"Poison--snakes--assassination--jail on trumped-up charges,\nand disease in jail--apparent accidents of all sorts.  It doesn't pay to know\ntoo much.\"\n\n\"Then we're suspected of hunting for this treasure?  Is that the idea?\"\n\n\"Not at all, since you've denied it.  I believe you implicitly.  But I hope\nyour husband doesn't stumble on it.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Or if he does, that he'll see his way clear to notify me first.\"\n\n\"Would that be honest?\"\n\nHe changed his mind.  That was a point on which Samson prided himself.\nHe was not hidebound to one plan as some men are, but could keep\ntwo or three possibilities in mind and follow up whichever suited him.\nThis was a case for indiscretion after all.\n\n\"Seeing we're alone, and that you're a most exceptional woman, I think\nI'll let you into a diplomatic secret, Mrs. Blaine.  Only you mustn't repeat it.\nThe present maharajah, Gungadhura, isn't the saving kind;  he's a spender.\nHe'd give his eyes to get hold of that treasure.  And if he had it, we'd\nneed an army to suppress him.  We made a mistake when Bubru Singh\ndied;  there were two nephews with about equal claims, and we picked\nthe wrong one--a born intriguer.  I'd call him a rascal if he weren't a\nreigning prince.  It's too late now to unseat him--unless, of course, we\nshould happen to catch him in flagrante delicto.\"\n\n\"What does that mean?  With the goods?  With the treasure?\"\n\n\"No, no.  In the act of doing something grossly ultra vires--illegal, that's\nto say.  But you've put your finger on the point.  If the treasure should\nbe found--as it might be--somewhere hidden on that little plot of ground\nwith a palace on it on our side of the river, our problem would be fairly easy.\nThere'd be some way of--ah--making sure the fund would be properly\nadministered.  But if Gungadhura found it in the hills, and kept quiet\nabout it as he doubtless would, he'd have every sedition-monger in\nIndia in his pay within a year, and the consequences might be very serious.\"\n\n\"Who is the other man--the one the British didn't choose?\" asked Tess.\n\n\"A very decent chap named Utirupa--quite a sportsman.  He was thought\ntoo young at the time the selection was made;  but he knew enough to\nget out of the reach of the new maharajah immediately.  They have a\nphrase here, you know, 'to hate like cousins.'  They're rather remote\ncousins, but they hate all the more for that.\"\n\n\"So you'd rather that the treasure stayed buried?\"\n\n\"Not exactly.  But he tossed ash from the end of his cigar to illustrate\noffhandedness.  \"I think I could promise ten per cent. of it to whoever\nbrought us exact information of its whereabouts before the maharajah\ncould lay his hands on it.\"\n\n\"I'll tell that to my husband.\"\n\n\"Do.\"\n\n\"Of course, being in a way in partnership with Gungadhura, he might--\"\n\n\"Let me give you one word of caution, if I may without offense.  We--\nour government--wouldn't recognize the right of--of any one to take that\ntreasure out of the country.  Ten per cent. would be the maximum, and\nthat only in case of accurate information brought in time to us.\"\n\n\"Aren't findings keepings?  Isn't possession nine points of the law?\"\nlaughed Tess.\n\n\"In certain cases, yes.  But not where government knows of the existence\nsomewhere of a hoard of public funds--an enormous hoard--it must\nrun into millions.\"\n\n\"Then, if the maharajah should find it would you take it from him?\"\n\n\"No.  We would put the screws on, and force him to administer the\nfund properly if we knew about it.  But he'd never tell.\"\n\n\"Then how d'you know he hasn't found the stuff already?\"\n\n\"Because many of his personal bills aren't paid, and the political stormy\npetrels are not yet heading his way.  He's handicapped by not being\nable to hunt for it openly.  Some ill-chosen confidant might betray the\nfind to us.  I doubt if he trusts more than one or two people at a time.\"\n\n\"It must be hell to be a maharajah!\" Tess burst out after a minute's silence.\n\n\"It's sometimes hell to be commissioner, Mrs. Blaine.\"\n\n\"If I were Gungadhura I'd find that money or bust!  And when I'd found it--\"\n\n\"You'd endow an orphan asylum, eh?\"\n\n\"I'd make such trouble for you English that you'd be glad to leave me\nin peace for a generation!\"\n\nSamson laughed good-naturedly and twisted up the end of his mustache.\n\n\"Pon my soul, you're a surprising woman!  So your sympathies are all\nwith Gungadhura?\"\n\n\"Not at all.  I think he's a criminal!  He buys women, and tortures animals\nin an arena, and keeps a troupe of what he is pleased to call dancing-girls.\nI've seen his eyes in the morning, and I suspect him of most of the\nvices in the calendar.  He's despicable.  But if I were in his shoes I'd\nfind that money and make it hot for you English!\"\n\n\"Are you of Irish extraction, Mrs. Blaine?\"\n\n\"No, indeed I'm not.  I'm Connecticut Yankee, and my husband's from\nthe West.  I don't have to be Irish to think for myself, do I?\"\n\nSamson did not know whether or not to take her seriously, but recognized\nthat his chance had gone that morning for the flirtation he had had in view--\nvery mild, of course, for a beginning;  it was his experience that most\nthings ought to start quite mildly, if you hoped to keep the other man\nfrom stampeding the game.  Nevertheless, as a judge of situations,\nbe preferred not to take his leave at that moment.  Give a woman the\nlast word always, but be sure it is a question, which you leave unanswered.\n\n\"You've a beautiful garden,\" he said;  and for a minute or two they talked\nof flowers, of which he knew more than a little;  then of music, of which\nhe understood a very great deal.\n\n\"Have you a proper lease on this house?\" he asked at last.\n\n\"I believe so. Why?\"\n\n\"I've been told there's some question about the title.  Some one's bringing\nsuit against your landlord for possession on some ground or another.\"\n\n\"What of it?  Suppose the other should win--could he put us out?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  That might depend on your present landlord's power to\nmake the lease at the time when he made it.\"\n\n\"But we signed the agreement in good faith.  Surely, as long as we\npay the rent--?\"\n\n\"I don't know, I'm sure.  Well--if there's any trouble, come to me about\nit and we'll see what can be done.\"\n\n\"But who is this who is bringing suit against the landlord?\"\n\n\"I haven't heard his name--don't even know the details.  I hope you'll\ncome out of it all right.  Certainly I'll help in any way I can.  Sometimes\na little influence, you know, exerted in the right way--well--Please give\nmy regards to your husband--Good morning, Mrs. Blaine.\"\n\nIt was a pet theory of his that few men pay enough attention to their\nbacks,--not that he preached it;  preaching is tantamount to spilling beans,\nsupposing that the other fellow listens;  and if he doesn't listen it is\nwaste of breath.  But he bore in mind that people behind him had eyes\nas well as those in front.  Accordingly he made a very dignified exit\ndown the long path, tipped Mrs. Blaine's sais all the man had any right\nto expect, and rode away feeling that he had made the right impression.\nHe looked particularly well on horseback.\n\nTheresa Blaine smiled after him, wondering what impression she herself\nhad made;  but she did not have much time to think about it.  From the\nopen window behind her she was seized suddenly, drawn backward\nand embraced.\n\n\"You are perfect!\" Yasmini purred in her ear between kisses.  \"You are\nsurely one of the fairies sent to live among mortals for a sin!  I shall\nlove you forever!  Now that burra-wallah Samson sahib will ride into the\ntown, and perhaps also to the law-court, and to other places, to ask about\nyour landlord, of whom he knows nothing, having only heard a servant's\ntale.  But Tom Tripe will have told already that I am at the burra commissioner's\nhouse, and Gungadhura will send there to ask questions.  And whoever\ngoes will have to wait long.  And when the commissioner returns at last\nhe will deny that I have been there, and the messenger will return to\nGungadhura, who will not believe a word of it, especially as he will know\nthat the commissioner has been riding about the town on an unknown\nerrand.  So, after he has learned that I am back in my own palace,\nGungadhura will try to poison me again.  All of which is as it should be.\nCome closer and let me--\"\n\n\"Child!\" Tess protested. \"Do you realize that you're dressed up like an\nextremely handsome man, and are kissing me through a window in the\nsight of all Sialpore?  How much reputation do you suppose I shall have\nleft within the hour?\n\n\"There is only one kind of reputation worth the having,\" laughed Yasmini;\n\"that of knowing how to win!\"\n\n\"But what's this about poison?\" Tess asked her.\n\n\"He always tries to poison me.  Now he will try more carefully.\"\n\n\"You must take care!  How will you prevent him?\"\n\nBy quite unconscious stages Tess found herself growing concerned\nabout this young truant princess.  One minute she was interested and\namused.  The next she was conscious of affection.  Now she was\npositively anxious about her, to use no stronger word.  Nor had she\ntime to wonder why, for Yasmini's methods were breathless.\n\n\"I shall eat very often at your house.  And then you shall take a journey\nwith me.  And after that the great pig Gungadhura shall be very sorry\nhe was born, and still more sorry that be tried to poison me!\"\n\n\"Tell me, child, haven't you a mother?\"\n\n\"She died a year ago.  If there is such a place as hell she has gone\nthere, of course, because nobody is good enough for Heaven.  But I\nam not Christian and not Hindu, so hell is not my business.\"\n\n\"What are you, then?\"\n\n\"I am Yasmini.  There is nobody like me.  I am all alone, believing only\nwhat I know and laughing at the priests.  I know all the laws of caste,\nbecause that is necessary if you are to understand men.  And I have\nlet the priests teach me their religion because it is by religion that they\ngovern people.  And the priests,\" she laughed, \"are much more foolish\nthan the fools they entice and frighten.  But the priests have power.\nGungadhura is fearfully afraid of them.  The high priest of the temple\nof Jinendra pretends to him that he can discover where the treasure is\nhidden, so Gungadhura makes daily offerings and the priest grows\nvery fat.\"\n\n\"Who taught you such good English?\" Tess asked her;  for there was\nhardly even a trace of foreign accent, nor the least hesitation for a word.\n\n\"Father Bernard, a Jesuit.  My mother sent for him, and he came every\nday, year after year.  He had a little chapel in Sialpore where a few of\nthe very low-caste people used to go to pray and make confessions\nto him.  That should have given him great power;  but the people of\nthis land never confess completely, as he told me the Europeans do,\npreferring to tell lies about one another rather than the truth about themselves.\nI refused to be baptized because I was tired of him, and after my mother\ndied and she was burned with the Hindu ritual, he received orders to\ngo elsewhere.  Now there is another Jesuit, but he only has a little following\namong the English, and can not get to see me because I hide behind\nthe purdah.  The purdah is good--if you know how to make use of it\nand not be ruled by it.\"\n\nThey were still in the window, Yasmini kneeling on the cushions with her\nface in shadow and Tess with her back to the light.\n\n\"Ah!  Hasamurti comes!\" said Yasmini suddenly.  \"She is my cheti.\"\n(Hand-maiden.)\n\nTess turned swiftly, but all she saw was one of the three beggars down\nby the little gate twisting himself a garland out of stolen flowers.\n\n\"Now there will be a carriage waiting, and I must leave my horse in your stable.\"\n\nThe beggar held the twisted flowers up to the sun-light to admire his work.\n\n\"I must go at once.  I shall go to the temple of Jinendra, where the priest,\nwho is no man's friend, imagines I am a friend of his.  He will promise\nme anything if I will tell him what to say to Gungadhura;  and I shall tell\nhim, without believing the promises.  One of these days perhaps he\nwill plot with Gungadhura to have me poisoned, being in agreement\nwith the commissioner sahib who said to you just now that it is not good\nto know too much!  But neither is it good to be too late!  Lend me a\ncovering, my sister--see, this is the very thing.  I shall leave by the little gate.\nSend the gardener on an errand.  Are the other servants at the back\nof the house?  Of course yes, they will be spying to see me leave by\nthe way I came.\"\n\nTess sent the gardener running for a basket to put flowers in, and when\nshe turned her head again Yasmini had stepped out through the window\nshrouded from head to heels in a camel-hair robe such as the Bikanir\nDesert men wear at night.  The lower part of her face was hooded in it.\n\nProvided you wear a turban you can wear anything else you like in India\nwithout looking incongruous.  It is the turban that turns the trick.  Even\nthe spurs on the heels of riding-boots did not look out of place.\n\n\"You'll sweat,\" laughed Tess.  \"That camel-hair is hot stuff.\"\n\n\"Does the panther sweat under his pelt?  I am stronger than a panther.\nNow swiftly!  I must go, but I will come soon.  You are my friend.\"\n\nShe was gone like a shadow without another word, with long swift strides,\nnot noticing the beggars and not noticed by them as far as any one could tell.\nTess sat down to smoke a cigarette and think the experience over.\n\nShe had not done thinking when Dick Blaine returned unexpectedly for\nearly lunch and showed her a bag-full of coarsely powdered quartz.\n\n\"There's color there,\" he said jubilantly.  \"Rather more than merely color!\nIt's not time to talk yet, but I think I've found a vein that may lead somewhere.\nThen won't Gungadhura gloat?\"\n\nShe told him at great length about Yasmini's visit, dwelling on every\ndetail of it, he listening like a man at a play, for Tess had the gift of\nclear description.\n\n\"Go a journey with her, if you feel like it, Tess,\" he advised.  \"You have\na rotten time here alone all day, and I can't do much to 'liven it.  Take\nsensible precautions but have a good time anyway you can.\"\n\nBecause Yasmini had monopolized imagination she told him last of\nall, at lunch, about the commissioner's call, rehearsing that, too, detail\nby detail, word for word.\n\n\"Wants me to find the treasure, does he, and call the game on Gungadhura?\nWhat does he take me for?  One of his stool-pigeons?  If it's a question\nof percentage, I'd prefer one from the maharajah than from him.  If I\never stumble on it, Gungadhura shall know first go off the bat, and I'll\nsee the British Government in hell before I'll answer questions!\"\n\n\"They'd never believe Gungadhura hadn't rewarded you,\" said Tess.\n\n\"What of it?\" he demanded.  \"What do we care what they believe?  And\nsupposing it were true, what then?  Just at present I'm in partnership\nwith Gungadhura.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Four\n\n\nJinendra's Smile\n\nDeep broods the calm where the cooing doves are mating\nAnd shadows quiver noiseless 'neath the courtyard trees,\nCool keeps the gloom where the suppliants are waiting\nBegging little favors of Jinendra on their knees.\nPeace over all, and the consciousness of nearness,\nCharity removing the remoteness of the gods;\nSpirit of compassion breathing with new clearness\n\"There's a limit set to khama;  there's a surcease from the rods.\"\n\"Blessed were the few, who trim the lights of kindness,\nToiling in the temple for the love of one and all,\nIf it were not for hypocrisy and gluttony and blindness,\"\nSmiles the image of Jinendra on the courtyard wall.\n\n\n\"The law .... is like a python after monkey's in the tree-tops.\"\n\nYasmini, hooded like a bandit in the camel-hair cloak, resumed an air\nof leisurely dignity in keeping with the unhurried habit of Sialpore the\nmoment she was through the gate.  It was just as well she did, for Mukhum\nDass, the money-lender, followed by a sweating lean parasite on foot,\nwas riding a smart mule on his customary morning round to collect\ninterest from victims and oversee securities.\n\nHe was a fat, squat, slimy-looking person in a black alpaca coat, with a\nblack umbrella for protection from the sun, and an air of sour dissatisfaction\nfor general business purposes--an air that was given the lie direct by\na small, acquisitive nose and bright brown eyes that surely never made\nbad bargains.   Yasmini's hooded figure brought him to a halt just at\nthe corner, where the little road below the Blaines' wall joined the wider\nroad that led down-hill.  Business is business, and time a serious matter\nonly for those who sign promissory notes;  he drew rein without compunction.\n\n\"This house is yours?\" she asked, and he nodded, his sharp eyes shining\nlike an animal's, determined to recognize his questioner.\n\n\"There is a miscalculating son of lies who brings a lawsuit to get the title?\"\n\nHe nodded again--a man of few words except when words exacted interest.\n\n\"Dhulap Singh, is it not?  He is a secret agent of Gungadhura.\"\n\n\"How do you know?  Why should the maharajah want my property?\"\n\n\"He hunts high and low for the Sialpore treasure.  Jengal Singh, who\nbuilt this house, was in the confidence of Gungadhura's uncle, and a\npriest says there will be a clue found to the treasure beneath the floor\nof this house.\"\n\n\"A likely tale indeed!\"\n\n\"Very well, then--lose thine house!\"\n\nYasmini turned on a disdainful heel and started down-hill.  Mukhum Dass\ncalled after her, but she took no notice. He sent the sweating parasite\nto bring her back, but she shook him off with execrations. Mukhum\nDass turned his mule and rode down-hill after her.\n\n\"True information has its price,\" he said.  \"Tell me your name.\"\n\n\"That also has its price.\"\n\nHe cackled dryly.  \"Natives cost money only to their owners--on a hundi.\"\n(Promissory note.)\n\n\"Nevertheless there is a price.\"\n\n\"In advance?  I will give a half-rupee!\"\n\nOnce more Yasmini resumed her way down-hill.  Again Mukhum Dass\nrode after her.\n\n\"At any rate name the price.\"\n\n\"It is silence firstly;  second, a security for silence.\"\n\n\"The first part is easy.\"\n\n\"Nay, difficult.  A woman can keep silence, but men chatter like the apes,\nin every coffee shop.\"\n\nHis bargain-driver's eyes watched hers intently, unable to detect the\nslightest clue that should start him guessing.  He was trying to identify\na man, not a woman.\n\n\"How shall I give security for silence?\" he asked.\n\n\"I already hold it.\"\n\n\"How?  What?  Where?\"\n\nThe money-lender betrayed a glimpse of sheer pugnacity that seemed\nto amuse his tormentor.\n\n\"Send thy jackal out of ear-shot, tiger.\"\n\nHe snapped at his parasite angrily, and the man went away to sit down.  Then:\n\n\"Where are the title-deeds of the house you say you own?\" she asked\nhim suddenly.\n\nMukhum Dass kept silence, and tried to smother the raging anger in his eyes.\n\n\"Was it Mukhum Dass or another, who went to the priest in the temple\nof Jinendra on a certain afternoon and requested intercession to the\ngod in order that a title-deed might be recovered, that fell down the\nnullah when the snakes frightened a man's mule and he himself fell\ninto the road?  Or was it another accident that split that car of thine in\ntwo pieces?\"\n\n\"Priests cackle like old women,\" growled the money-lender.\n\n\"Nay, but this one cackled to the god.  Perhaps Jinendra felt compassionate\ntoward a poor shroff (money-lender) who can not defend his suit\nsuccessfully without that title-deed.  Jengal Singh died and his son,\nwho ought to know, claims that the house was really sold to Dhulap\nSingh, who dallies with his suit because he suspects, but does not\nknow, that Mukhum Dass has lost the paper--eh?\"\n\n\"How do you know these things?\"\n\n\"Maybe the god Jinendra told!  Which would be better, Mukhum Dass--\nto keep great silence, and be certain to receive the paper in time to\ndefend the lawsuit,--or to talk freely, and so set others talking?\"\n\nWho knows that it might not reach the ears of Jengal Singh that the title-deed\nis truly lost?\"\n\n\"He who tells secrets to a priest,\" swore the money-lender, \"would better\nhave screamed them from the housetop.\n\n\"Nay--the god heard.  The priest told the god, and the god told a certain\none to whom the finder brought the paper, asking a reward.  That person\nholds the paper now as security for silence!\"\n\n\"It is against the law to keep my paper!\"\n\n\"The law catches whom it can, Mukhum Dass, letting all others go, like\na python after monkeys in the tree-tops!\"\n\n\"From whom am I to get my paper for the lawsuit at the proper time?\"\n\n\"From Jinendra's priest perhaps.\"\n\n\"He has it now?  The dog's stray offspring!  I will--\"\n\n\"Nay, he has it not!  Be kind and courteous to Jinendra's priest, or perhaps\nthe god will send the paper after all to Dhulap Singh!\"\n\n\"As to what shall I keep silence?\"\n\n\"Two matters.  Firstly Chamu the butler will presently pay his son's debt.\nGive Chamu a receipt with the number of the bank-note written on it,\nsaying nothing.\"\n\n\"Second?\"\n\n\"Preserve the bank-note carefully for thirty days and keep silence.\"\n\n\"I will do that.  Now tell me thy name?\"\n\nYasmini laughed.  \"Do thy victims repay in advance the rupees not yet\nlent?  Nay, the price is silence!  First, pay the price;  then learn my name.\nGo--get thy money from Chamu the butler.  Breathe as much as a hint\nto any one, and thy title-deed shall go to Dhulap Singh!\"\n\nEying her like a hawk, but with more mixed emotions than that bird can\nlikely compass, the money-lender sat his mule and watched her stride\nround the corner out of sight.  Then, glancing over her shoulder to make\nsure the man's parasite was not watching her at his master's orders,\nshe ran along the shoulder of the hill to where, in the shelter of a clump\nof trees, a carriage waited.\n\nIt was one of those lumbering, four-wheeled affairs with four horses,\nand a platform for two standing attendants behind and wooden lattice-work\nover the windows, in which the women-folk of princes take the air.\nBut there were no attendants--only a coachman, and a woman who\ncame running out to meet her;  for Yasmini, like her cousin the maharajah,\ndid not trust too many people all at once.\n\n\"Quick, Hasamurti!\"\n\nFussing and giggling over her (the very name means Laughter), the\nmaid bustled her into the carriage, and without a word of instruction the\ncoachman tooled his team down-hill at a leisurely gait, as if told in advance\nto take his time about it;  the team was capable of speed.\n\nInside the carriage, with a lot more chuckling and giggling a change\nwas taking place almost as complete as that from chrysalis to butterfly.\nThe toilet of a lady of Yasmini's nice discrimination takes time in the\neasiest circumstances;  in a lumbering coach, not built for leg-room,\nand with a looking-glass the size of a saucer, it was a mixture of horse-play\nand miracle.  Between them they upset the perfume bottle, as was natural,\nand a shrill scream at one stage of the journey (that started a rumor all\nover Sialpore to the effect that Gungadhura was up to the same old\ngame again) announced, as a matter of plain fact that Yasmini had sat\non the spurs.  There was long, spun-gold hair to be combed out--penciling\nto do to eye-brows--lac to be applied to pretty feet to make them exquisitely\npretty--and layer on layer of gossamer silk to be smothered and hung\nexactly right.  Then over it all had to go one of those bright-hued silken\nveils that look so casually worn but whose proper adjustment is an art.\n\nBut when they reached the bottom of the long hill and began twisting\nin and out among the narrow streets, it was finished.  By the time they\nreached the temple of Jinendra, set back in an old stone courtyard with\nimages of the placid god carved all about in the shade of the wide\nprojecting cornice, all was quiet and orderly inside the carriage and there\nstepped out of it, followed by the same dark-hooded maid, a swift vision\nof female loveliness that flitted like a flash of light into the temple gloom.\n\nIt was not so squalid as the usual Hindu temple, although so ancient\nthat the carving of the pillars in some places was almost worn away,\nand the broad stone flags on the floor were hollowed deep by ages\nof devotion.  The gloom was pierced here and there by dim light from\nbrass lamps, that showed carvings blackened by centuries of smoke,\nbut there was an unlooked-for suggestion of care, and a little cleanliness\nthat the fresh blossoms scattered here and there accentuated.\n\nThere were very few worshipers at that hour--only a woman, who desired\na child and was praying to Jinendra as a last recourse after trying all\nthe other gods in vain, and a half-dozen men--all eyes--who gossiped\nin low tones in a corner.  Yasmini gave them small chance to recognize\nher.  Quicker than their gaze could follow, a low door at the rear, close\nbeside the enormous, jeweled image of the god, closed behind her\nand the maid, and all that was left of the vision was the ringing echo\nof an iron lock dying away in dark corners and suggesting nothing\nexcept secrecy.\n\nThe good square room she had entered so abruptly unannounced was\nswept and washed.  Sunlight poured into it at one end through a window\nthat opened on an inner courtyard, and there were flowers everywhere--\narranged in an enormous brass bowl on a little table--scattered at random\non the floor--hung in plaited garlands from the hooks intended to support\nlamps.  Of furniture there was little, only a long cushioned bench down\nthe length of the wall beneath the window, and a thing like a throne on\nwhich Jinendra's high priest sat in solitary grandeur.\n\nHe did not rise at first to greet her, for Jinendra's priest was fat;  there\nwas no gainsaying it.  After about a minute a sort of earthquake taking\nplace in him began to reach the surface;  he rocked on his center in\nincreasing waves that finally brought him with a spasm of convulsion\nto the floor.  There he stood in full sunlight with his bare toes turned\ninward, holding his stomach with both hands, while Yasmini settled\nherself in graceful youthful curves on the cushioned bench, with her\nface in shadow, and the smirking maid at her feet.  Then before climbing\nponderously back to his perch on the throne the priest touched his\nforehead once with both hands and came close to a semblance of\nbowing, the arrogance of sanctity combining with his paunch to cut\nthat ceremony short.\n\n\"Send the girl away,\" he suggested as soon as he was settled into\nplace again.  But Yasmini laughed at him with that golden note of hers\nthat suggests illimitable understanding and unfathomable mirth.\n\n\"I know the ways of priests,\" she answered.  \"The girl stays!\"\n\nThe priest's fat chops darkened a shade.\n\n\"There are things she should not know.\"\n\n\"She knows already more in her small head than there is in all thy big\nbelly, priest of an idol!\"\n\n\"Beware, woman, lest the gods hear sacrilege!\"\n\n\"If they are real gods they love me,\" she answered,  \"If they have any\nsense they will be pleased whenever I laugh at your idolatry.  Hasamurti stays.\"\n\n\"But at the first imaginary insult she will run with information to wherever\nit will do most harm.  If she can be made properly afraid, perhaps--\"\n\nYasmini's golden laugh cut him off short.\n\n\"If she is made afraid now she will hate me later.  As long as she loves\nme she will keep my secrets, and she will love me because of the\nsecrets--being a woman and not a belly-with-a-big-tongue, who would\nsell me to the highest bidder, if he dared.  I know a Brahman.  Thou\nand I are co-conspirators because my woman's wit is sharper than\nthy greed.  We are confidants because I know too much of thy misdeeds.\nWe are going to succeed because I laugh at thy fat fears, and am\nnever deceived for a moment by pretense of sanctity or promises\nhowever vehement.\"\n\nShe said all that in a low sweet voice, and with a smile that would have\nmade a much less passionate man lose something of his self-command.\nJinendra's priest began to move uneasily.\n\n\"Peace, woman!\"\n\n\"There is no peace where priests are,\" she retorted in the same sweet-\nhumored voice.  \"I am engaged in war, not honey-gathering.  I have\nlied sufficient times today to Mukhum Dass to need ten priests, if I\nbelieved in them or were afraid to lie!  The shroff will come to ask about\nhis title-deed.  Tell him you are told a certain person has it, but that if\nhe dares breathe a word the paper will go straight to Dhulap Singh,\nwho will destroy it and so safely bring his lawsuit.  Then let Dhulap Singh\nbe told also that the title-deed is in certain hands, so he will put off the\nlawsuit week after week, and one who is my friend will suffer no annoyance.\"\n\n\"Who is this friend?\"\n\n\"Another one who builds no bridges on thy sanctity.\"\n\n\"Not one of the English?  Beware of them, I say;  beware of them!\"\n\n\"No, not one of the English.  Next, let Gungadhura be told that Tom\nTripe has ever an open-handed welcome at Blaine sahib's--\"\n\n\"Ah!\" he objected, shaking his fat face until the cheeks wabbled.\n\"Women are all fools sooner or later.  Why let a drunken English soldier\nbe included in the long list of people to be reckoned with?\"\n\n\"Because Gungadhura will then show much favor to Tom Tripe, who\nis my friend, and it amuses me to see my friends prosper.  Also I\nhave a plan.\"\n\n\"Plans--plans--plans!  And whither does the tangle lead us?\"\n\n\"To the treasure, fool!\"\n\n\"But if you know so surely where the treasure is, woman, why not tell\nme and --\"\n\nAgain the single note of mocking golden laughter cut him off short.\n\n\"I would trust thee with the secret, Brahman, just as far as the herdsman\ntrusts a tiger with his sheep.\"\n\n\"But I could insure that Gungadhura should divide it into three parts, and--\"\n\n\"When the time comes,\" she answered, \"the priest of Jinendra shall\ncome to me for his proportion, not I to the priest.  Nor will there be three\nportions, but one--with a little percentage taken from it for the sake of\nthy fat belly.  Gungadhura shall get nothing!\"\n\n\"I wash my hands of it all!\" the priest retorted indignantly.  \"The half for\nme, or I wash my hands of it and tell Gungadhura that you know the\nsecret!  I will trust him to find a way to draw thy cobra from its hole!\"\n\n\"Maybe he might,\" she nodded, smiling, \"after the English had finished\nhanging thee for that matter of the strangling of Rum Dass.  Thy fat belly\nwould look laughable indeed banging by a stretched neck from a noose.\nThey would need a thick rope.  They might even make the knot slippery\nwith cow-grease for thy special benefit.\"\n\nThe priest winced.\n\n\"None can prove that matter,\" he said, recovering his composure with\nan effort.\n\n\"Except I,\" she retorted, \"who have the very letter that was written to\nRum Dass that brought him into thy clutches--and five other proofs beside!\nTwo long years I waited to have a hold on thee, priest, before I came\nto blossom in the odor of thy sanctity;  now I am willing to take the small\nchance of thy temper getting the better of discretion!\"\n\n\"You are a devil,\" he said simply, profoundly convinced of the truth of\nhis remark;  and she laughed like a mischievous child, clapping her\nhands together.\n\n\"So now,\" she said, \"there is little else to discuss.  If Gungadhura should\nbe superstitious fool enough to come to thee again for auguries and\ngodly counsel--\"\n\n\"He comes always.  He shows proper devotion to Jinendra.\"\n\n\"Repeat the former story that a clue to the treasure must be found in\nBlaine sahib's house --\"\n\n\"In what form?  He will ask me again in what form the clue will be, that\nhe may recognize it?\"\n\n\"Tell him there is a map.  And be sure to tell him that Tom Tripe is\nwelcome at the house.  Have you understood?  Then one other matter:\nwhen it is known that I am back in my palace Gungadhura will set extra\nspies on me, and will double the guard at all the doors to keep me\nfrom getting out again.  He will not trust Tom Tripe this time, but will\ngive the charge to one of the Rajput officers.  But he will have been\ntold that I was at the commissioner sahib's house this morning, and\ntherefore he will not dare to have me strangled, because the commissioner\nsahib might make inquiries.  I have also made other precautions--and\na friend.  But tell Gungadhura, lest he make altogether too much trouble\nfor me, that I applied to the commissioner sahib for assistance to go\nto Europe, saying I am weary of India.  And add that the commissioner\nsahib counseled me not to go, but promised to send English memsahibs\nto see me.\"  (She very nearly used the word American, but thought\nbetter of it on the instant.)\n\n\"He will ask me how I know this,\" said the Brahman, turning it all over\nslowly in his mind and trying to make head or tail of it.\n\n\"Tell him I came here like himself for priestly counsel and made a clean\nbreast of everything to thee!  He will suspect thee of lying to him;  but\nwhat is one lie more or less?\"\n\nWith that final shaft she gathered up her skirts, covered her face, nudged\nthe giggling maid and left him, turning the key in the lock herself and\nflitting out through gloom into the sunlight as fast as she had come.\nThe carriage was still waiting at the edge of the outer court, and once\nagain the driver started off without instructions, but tooling his team this\ntime at a faster pace, with a great deal of whip-cracking and shouts to\npedestrians to clear the way.  And this time the carriage had an escort\nof indubitable maharajah's men, who closed in on it from all sides, their\nnumbers increasing, mounted and unmounted, until by the time Yasmini's\nown palace gate was reached there was as good as a state procession,\nmade up for the most part of men who tried to look as if they had made\na capture by sheer derring-do and skill.\n\nAnd down the street, helter-skelter on a sweating thoroughbred, came\nMaharajah Gungadhura Singh just in time to see the back of the carriage\nas it rumbled in through the gateway and the iron doors clanged behind it.\nScowling--altogether too round-shouldered for the martial stock he sprang\nfrom--puffy-eyed, and not so regal as overbearing in appearance, he\nsat for a few minutes stroking his scented beard upward and muttering\nto himself.\n\nThen some one ventured to tell him where the carriage had been seen\nwaiting, and with what abundant skill it had been watched and tracked\nfrom Jinendra's temple to that gate.  At that he gave an order about the\nposting of the guard, and, beckoning only one mounted attendant to\nfollow him, clattered away down-street, taking a turn or two to throw the\ncurious off the scent, and then headed straight for the temple on his\nown account.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Five\n\n\n\n\nAn Audit by the Gods\n\n(I)\n\nThus spoke the gods from their place above the firmament\nTurning from the feasting and the music and the mirth:\n\"There is time and tide to burn;\nLet us stack the plates a turn\nAnd study at our leisure what the trouble is with earth.\"\n\nDown, down they looked through the azure of the Infinite\nScanning each the meadows where he went with men of yore,\nEach his elbows on a cloud,\nMaking reckoning aloud -\nTill the murmur of God wonder was a titan thunder-roar.\n\n\"War rocks the world!  Look, the arquebus and culverin\nVanish in new sciences that presage T. N. T!\nLo, a dark, discolored swath\nWhere they drive new tools of wrath!\nDo they justify invention?  Will they scrap the Laws that Be?\n\n\"Look!  Mark ye well:  where we left a people flourishing\nSinging in the sunshine for the fun of being free,\nNow they burden man and maid\nWith a law the priests have laid,\nAnd the bourgeois blow their noses by a communal decree!\n\n\"Where, where away are the liberties we left to them -\nGift of being merry and the privilege of fun?\nIs delight no longer praise?\nWill they famish all their days\nFor a future built of fury in a present scarce begun?\"\n\n\n\"Most Precious friend ... please visit me!\"\n\nThe one thing in India that never happens is the expected.  If the actual\nthing itself does occur, then the manner of it sets up so many unforeseen\ncontingencies that only the subtlest mind, and the sanest and the least\nhidebound by opinion, can hope to read the signs fast enough to\nunderstand them as they happen.  Naturally, there are always plenty\nof people who can read backward after the event;  and the few of those\nwho keep the lesson to themselves, digesting rather than discussing\nit, are to be found eventually filling the senior secretaryships, albeit\nbitterly criticized by the other men, who unraveled everything afterward\nvery cleverly and are always unanimous on just one point--that the fellow\nwho said nothing certainly knew nothing, and is therefore of no account\nand should wield no influence, Q. E. D.\n\nAnd as we belong to the majority, in that we are uncovering the course\nof these events very cleverly long after they took place, we must at\nthis point, to be logical, denounce Theresa Blaine.  She was just as\nmuch puzzled as anybody.  But she said much less than anybody,\nwasted no time at all on guesswork, pondered in her heart persistently\nwhatever she had actually seen and heard, and in the end was almost\nthe only non-Indian actor on the stage of Sialpore to reap advantage.\nIf that does not prove unfitness for one of the leading parts, what does?\nA star should scintillate--should focus all eyes on herself and interrupt\nthe progress of the play to let us know how wise and\nbeautiful and wonderful she is.  But Tess apparently agreed with Hamlet\nthat \"the play's the thing,\" and was much too interested in the plot to\ninterfere with it.  She attended the usual round of dinners, teas and tennis\nparties, that are part of the system by which the English keep alive\ntheir courage, and growing after a while a little tired of trivialty, she tried\nto scandalize Sialpore by inviting Tom Tripe to her own garden party,\nsuccessfully overruling Tripe's objections.\n\n\"Between you and I and the gate-post, lady, they don't hanker for my\nsociety.  If somebody--especially colonels, or a judge maybe,--wanted\nto borrow a horse from the maharajah's stable,--or perhaps they'd like\na file o' men to escort a picnic in the hills,--then it's 'Oh, hello, good\nmorning, Mr. Tripe.  How's the dog this morning?  And oh, by the way--'\nThen I know what's coming an' what I can do for 'em I do, for I confess,\nlady, that I hanker for a little bit o' flattery and a few words o' praise I'm\nnot entitled to.  I don't covet any man's money--or at least not enough\nto damn me into hell on that account.  Finding's keeping, and a bet's\na bet, but I don't covet money more than that dog o' mine covets fleas.\nHe likes to scratch 'em when he has 'em.  Me the same;  I can use\nmoney with the next man, his or mine.  But I wouldn't go to hell for money\nany more than Trotters would for fleas, although, mind you, I'm not saying\nTrotters hasn't got fleas.  He has 'em, same as hell's most folks' destiny.\nBut when it comes to praise that ain't due me, lady, I'm like Trotters\nwith another dog's bone--I've simply got to have it, reason or no reason.\nA common ordinary bone with meat on it is just a meal.  Praise I've\nearned is nothing wonderful.  But praise I don't deserve is stolen fruit,\nand that's the sweetest.  Now, if I was to come to your party I'd get no\n praise, ma'am.  I'd be doing right by you, but they'd say I didn't know\nmy place, and by and by they'd prove it to me sharp and sneery.  I'll\nbe a coward to stop away, but--'Sensible man,' they'll say.  'Knows when\nhe isn't wanted.'  You see, ma'am, yours is the only house in Sialpore\nwhere I can walk in and know I'm welcome whether you're at home or not.\"\n\n\"All the more reason for coming to the party, Tom.\"\n\n\"Ah-h-h!  If only you understood!\"\n\nHe wagged his head and one finger at her in his half-amused paternal\nmanner that would often win for him when all else failed.  But this time\nit did not work.\n\n\"I don't care for half-friends, Tom.  If you expect to be welcome at my\nhouse you must come to my parties when I ask you.\"\n\n\"Lady, lady!\"\n\n\"I mean it.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well.  I'll come.  I've protested.  That absolves me.  And my\nhide's thick.  It takes more than just a snub or two--or three to knock\nmy number down!  Am I to bring Trotters?\"\n\n\"Certainly.  Trotters is my friend too.  I count on him to do his tricks and\nhelp entertain.\"\n\n\"They'll say of you, ma'am, afterward that you don't know better than\nask Tripe and his vulgar dog to meet nice people.\"\n\n\"They'll be right, Tom.  I don't know better.  I hope they'll say it to me,\nthat's all.\"\n\nBut Tess discovered when the day came that no American can scandalize\nthe English.  They simply don't expect an American to know bow to\nbehave, and Tom Tripe and his marvelous performing dog were accepted\nand approved of as sincerely as the real American ice-cream soda--\nand forgotten as swiftly the morning following.\n\nThe commissioner was actually glad to meet Tripe in the circumstances.\nIf the man should suppose that because Sir Roland Samson and a judge\nof appeal engaged in a three-cornered conversation with him at a garden\nparty, therefore either of them would speak to the maharajah's drill-master\nwhen next they should meet in public, he might guess again, that was all.\n\nOne of the things the commissioner asked Tripe was whether he was\nresponsible for the mounting of palace guards--of course not improperly\ninquisitive about the maharajah's personal affairs but anxious to seem\ninterested in the fellow's daily round, since just then one couldn't avoid him.\n\n\"In a manner, and after a fashion, yes, sir.  I'm responsible that routine\ngoes on regularly and that the men on duty know their business.\"\n\n\"Ah.  Nothing like responsibility.  Good for a man.  Some try to avoid it,\nbut it's good.  So you look after the guard on all the palaces?  The\nPrincess Yasmini's too, eh?  Well, well;  I can imagine that might be\nnervous work.  They say that young lady is--!  Eh, Tripe?\"\n\n\"I couldn't say, sir.  My duties don't take me inside the palace.\"\n\n\"Now, now, Tripe!  No use trying to look innocent!  They tell me she's\na handful and you encourage her!\"\n\n\"Some folks don't care what they say, sir.\"\n\n\"If she should be in trouble I dare say, now, you'd be the man she'd\napply to for help.\"\n\n\"I'd like to think that, sir.\"\n\n\"Might ask you to take a letter for instance, to me or his honor the judge here?\"\n\nThe judge walked away.  He did not care to be mixed up in intrigue,\neven hypothetically, and especially with a member of the lower orders.\n\n\"I'd do for her what I'd do for a daughter of my own, sir, neither more\nnor less.\"\n\n\"Quite so, Tripe.  If she gave you a letter to bring to me, you'd bring it, eh?\"\n\n\"Excepting barratry, the ten commandments, earthquake and the act\nof God, sir, yes.\"\n\n\"Without the maharajah knowing?\"\n\n\"Without his highness knowing.\"\n\n\"You'd do that with a clear conscience, eh?\"\n\nTom Tripe screwed his face up, puffed his cheeks, and struck a very\nmilitary attitude.\n\n\"A soldier's got no business with a conscience, sir.  Conscience makes\na man squeamish o' doing right for fear his wife's second cousin might\ntell the neighbors.\"\n\n\"Ha-ha!  Very profoundly philosophic!  I dare wager you've carried her\nletters at least a dozen times--now come.\"\n\nAgain Tom Tripe puffed out his cheeks and struck an attitude.\n\n\"Men don't get hanged for murder, sir.\"\n\n\"For what, then?\"\n\n\"Talking before and afterward!\"\n\n\"Excellent!  If only every one remembered that!  Did it ever occur to\nyou how the problem might be reversed ?\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"There might one day be a letter for the Princess Yasmini that, as her\nfriend, you ought to make sure should reach her.\"\n\n\"I'd take a letter from you to her, sir, if that's your meaning.\"\n\nSir Roland Samson, K. C. S. I., looked properly shocked.\n\nThere are few things so appalling as the abruptness with which members\nof the lower orders divest diplomacy's kernel of its decorative outer shell.\n\"What I meant is--ah--\"  He set his monocle, and stared as if Tripe were\nan insect on a pin-point.  \"Since you admit you're in the business of\nintriguing for the princess, no doubt you carry letters to, as well as from\nher, and hold your tongue about that too?\"\n\n\"If I should deliver letters they'd be secret or they'd have gone through\nthe mail.  I'd risk my job each time I did it.  Would I risk it worse by talking?\nOnce the maharajah heard a whisper--\"\n\n\"Well--I'll be careful not to drop a hint to his highness.  As you say, it\nmight imperil your job.  And, ah--\" (again the monocle,) \"--the initials r. s.--\nin small letters, not capitals, in the bottom left-hand corner of a small\nwhite envelope would--ah--you understand?--you'd see that she received it, eh?\"\n\nTom Tripe bridled visibly.  Neither the implied threat nor the proposal\nto make use of him without acknowledging the service afterward, escaped\nhim.  Samson, who believed among other things in keeping all inferiors\nthoroughly in their place decided on the instant to rub home the lesson\nwhile it smarted.\n\n\"You'd find it profitable.  You'd be paid whatever the situation called for.\nYou needn't doubt that.\"\n\nTess, talking with a group of guests some little distance off, observed\na look of battle in Tom Tripe's eye, and smiled two seconds later as\nthe commissioner let fall his monocle.  Two things she was certain of\nat once:  Tom Tripe would tell her at the first opportunity exactly what\nhad happened, and Samson would lie about it glibly if provoked.  She\npromised herself she would provoke him.  As a matter of fact Tom\ngave her two or three versions afterward of what his words had been,\ntheir grandeur increasing as imagination flourished in the comfortable\nwarmth of confidence.  But the first account came from a fresh memory:\n\n\"No money you'll ever touch would buy my dog's silence, let alone\nmine, sir!  If you've a letter for the princess, send it along and I'll see\nshe gets it.  If she cares to answer it, I'll see the answer reaches you.\nAs for dropping hints to the maharajah about my doing little services\nfor the princess,--a gentleman's a gentleman, and don't need instruction--\nnor advice from me.  If I was out of a job tomorrow I'd still be a man\non two feet, to be met as such.\"\n\nA man of indiscretion, and a diplomat, must have fireproof feelings.\nAs Tess had observed, Samson blenched distinctly, but he recovered\nin a second and put in practise some of that opportunism that was his\nsecret pride, reflecting how a less finished diplomatist would have betrayed\nresentment at the snub from an inferior instead of affecting not to notice\nit at all.  As a student of human nature he decided that Tom Tripe's pride\nwas the point to take advantage of.\n\n\"You're the very man I can trust,\" he said.  \"I'm glad we have had this talk.\nIf ever you receive a small white envelope marked r. s. in the left-hand\nbottom corner, see that the princess gets it, and say nothing.\"\n\n\"Trust me, eh?\" Tripe muttered as Samson walked away.  \"You never\ntrusted your own mother without you had a secret hold over her.  I wouldn't\ntrust you that far!\"  He spat among the flowers, for Tom could not pretend\nto real garden-party manners.  \"And if she trusts you, letters or no letters,\nI'll eat my spurs and saber cold for breakfast.\"\n\nThen, as if to console himself with proof that some one in the world did\ntrust him thoroughly, Tom swaggered with a riding-master stride to where\nTess stood talking with a Rajput prince, who had come late and threatened\nto leave early.  The prince had puzzled her by referring two or three times\nto his hurry, once even going so far as to say good-by, and then not\ngoing.  It was as if he expected her to know something that she did\nnot know, and to give him a cue that he waited for in vain.  She felt he\nmust think her stupid, and the thought made her every minute less at\nease;  but Tom's approach, eyed narrowly by Samson for some reason,\nseemed to raise the Rajput's spirits.\n\n\"If only my husband were here,\" she said aloud, \"but at the last minute--\nthere was blasting, you know, and--\"\n\nThe prince--he was quite a young one--twenty-one perhaps--murmured\nsomething polite and with eyes that smoldered watched Tom take a\nletter from his tunic pocket.  He handed it to Tess with quite a flourish.\n\n\"Some one must have dropped this, ma'am.\"\n\nThe envelope was scented, and addressed in Persian characters.  She\nsaw the prince's eyes devour the thing--saw him exchange glances with\nTom Tripe--and realized that Tom had rather deftly introduced her to\nanother actor in the unseen drama that was going on.  Clearly the next\nmove was hers.\n\n\"Is it yours, perhaps?\" she asked.\n\nPrince Utirupa Singh bowed and took the letter.  Samson with a look\nof baffled fury behind the monocle, but a smile for appearance's sake,\njoined them at that minute and Utirupa seemed to take delight in so\nmanipulating the sealed envelope that the commissioner could only\nsee the back of it.\n\nThe prince was an extremely handsome young man, as striking in one\nway as Samson in another.  Polo and pig-sticking had kept him lean,\nand association with British officers had given him an air of being frankly\nat his ease even when really very far from feeling it.  He had the natural\nOriental gift of smothering excitement, added to a trick learned from\nthe West of aggressive self-restraint that is not satisfied with seeming\nthe opposite of what one is, but insists on extracting humor from the\nsituation and on calling attention to the humor.\n\n\"I shall always be grateful to you,\" he said, smiling into Tess's eyes with\nhis own wonderful brown ones but talking at the commissioner.  \"If I\nhad lost this letter I should have been at a loss indeed.  If some one\nelse had found it, that might have been disastrous.\"\n\n\"But I did not find it for you,\" Tess objected.\n\nUtirupa turned his back to the commissioner and answered in a low voice.\n\n\"Nevertheless, when I lose letters I shall come here first!\"\n\nHe bowed to take his leave and showed the back of the envelope again\nto Samson, with a quiet malice worthy of Torquemada.  The commissioner\nlooked almost capable of snatching it.\n\n\"Mrs. Blaine,\" he said with a laugh after the prince had gone, \"skill and\nexperience, I am afraid, are not much good without luck.  Luck seems\nto be a thing I lack.  Now, if I had picked up that letter I've a notion that\nthe information in it would have saved me a year's work.\"\n\nTess was quite sure that Tom had not picked the letter up, but there\nwas no need to betray her knowledge.\n\n\"Do you mean you'd have opened a letter you picked up in my garden?\"\nshe demanded.\n\nHis eyes accepted her challenge.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"But why?  Surely--\"\n\n\"Necessity, dear lady, knows no law.  That's one of the first axioms of\ndiplomacy.  Consider your husband as a case in point.  Custom, which\nis the basis of nearly all law, says he ought to be here entertaining your\nguests.  Necessity, ignoring custom, obliges him to stay in the hills and\nsupervise the blasting, disappointing every one but me.  I'm going to\ntake advantage of his necessity.\"\n\nIf he had seen the swift glance she gave him he might have changed\nthe course of one small part of history.  Tess knew nothing of the intrigue\nhe was engaged in, and did not propose to be keeper of his secrets;\nif he had glimpsed that swift betrayal of her feelings he would certainly\nnot have volunteered further confidences.  But the poison of ambition\nblinds all those who drink it, so that the \"safest\" men unburden themselves\nto the wrong unwilling ears.\n\n\"Walk with me up and down the path where every one can see us, won't you?\"\n\n\"Why?\" she laughed.  \"Do you flatter yourself I'd be afraid to be caught\nalone with you?\"\n\n\"I hope you'd like to be alone with me!  I would like nothing better.  But\nif we walk up and down together on the path in full view, we arouse no\nsuspicion and we can't be overheard.  I propose to tell some secrets.\"\n\nNot many women would resist the temptation of inside political information.\nRecognizing that by some means beyond her comprehension she\nwas being drawn into a maze of secrets all interrelated and any of them\nlikely to involve herself at any minute, Tess had no compunction whatever.\n\n\"I'll be frank with you,\" she said.  \"I'm curious.\"\n\nOnce they walked up the path and down again, talking of dogs, because\nit happened that Tom Tripe's enormous beast was sprawling in the\nshadow of a rose-bush at the farther end.  The commissioner did not\nlike dogs.  \"Something loathsome about them--degrading--especially\nthe big ones.\"  She disagreed.  She liked them, cold wet noses and all,\neven in the dark.  Tom Tripe, stepping behind a bush with the obvious\npurpose of smoking in secret the clay pipe that be hardly troubled to\nconceal, whistled the dog, who leapt into life as if stung and joined his master.\n\nThe second time up and down they talked of professional beggars and\nwhat a problem they are to India, because they both happened as they\nturned to catch sight of Umra with the one eye, entering through the\nlittle gate in the wall and shuffling without modesty or a moment's\nhesitation to his favorite seat among the shrubs, whence to view\nproceedings undisturbed.\n\n\"Those three beggars that haunt this house seem to claim all our\nprivileges,\" she said.  \"They wouldn't think of letting us give a garden\nparty without them.\"\n\n\"Say the word,\" he said, \"and I'll have them put in prison.\"\n\nBut she did not say the word.\n\nThe third time up the path he chose to waste on very obvious flattery.\n\n\"You're such an unusual woman, you know, Mrs. Blaine.  You understand\nwhatever's said to you, and don't ask idiotic questions.  And then, of\ncourse, you're American, and I feel I can say things to you that my\nown countrywoman wouldn't understand.  As an American, in other\nwords, you're privileged.\"\n\nAs they turned at the top of the path she felt a cold wet something thrust\ninto her hand from behind.  She had never in her life refused a caress\nto a dog that asked for one, and her fingers closed almost unconsciously\non Trotters' muzzle, touching as they did so the square unmistakable\nhard edges of an envelope.  There was no mistaking the intent;  the\ndog forced it on her and, the instant her fingers closed on it, slunk out of sight.\n\n\"Wasn't that Tripe's infernal dog again?\"\n\n\"Was it?  I didn't see.\" She was wiping slobber on to her skirt from an\nenvelope whose strong perfume had excited the dog's salivary glands.\nBut it was true that she did not see.\n\n\"May I call you Theresa?\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"It would encourage confidences.  There isn't another woman in Sialpore\nwhom I could tell what I'm going to say to you.  The others would repeat\nit to their husbands, or--\"\n\n\"I tell mine everything.  Every word!\"\n\n\"Or they'd try to work me on the strength of it for little favors--\"\n\n\"Wait until you know me!  Little favors don't appeal to me.  I like them\nbig--very big!\"\n\n\"Honestly, Theresa--\"\n\n\"Better call me Mrs. Blaine.\"\n\n\"Honestly, there's nothing under heaven that--\"\n\n\"That you really know about me.  I know there isn't.  You were going\nto tell secrets.  I'm listening.\"\n\n\"You're a hard-hearted woman!\"\n\nShe had contrived by that time to extract a letter from the envelope\nbehind her back, but how to read it without informing Samson was\nanother matter.  As she turned up the path for the sixth time, the sight\nof Tom Tripe making semi-surreptitious signals to attract her attention\nconvinced her that the message was urgent and that she should not\nwait to read it until after her last guests were gone.  It was only one\nsheet of paper, written probably on only one side--she hoped in English.\nBut how -\n\nSuddenly she screamed, and Samson was all instant concern.\n\n\"Was that a snake?  Tell me, was that a snake I saw.  Oh, do look, please!\nI loathe them.\"\n\n\"Probably a lizard.\"\n\n\"No, no, I know a lizard.  Do please look!\"\n\nUnbelieving, he took a stick and poked about among the, flowers to\noblige her; so she read the message at her leisure behind the broad\nof his back, and had folded it out of sight before he looked up.\n\n\"No snakes.  Nothing but a lizard.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm so glad!  Please forgive me, but I dread snakes.  Now tell\nme the secrets while I listen properly.\"\n\nHe noticed a change in her voice--symptoms of new interest, and\npassed it to the credit of himself.\n\n\"There's an intrigue going on, and you can help me.  Sp--people whose\nbusiness it is to keep me informed have reported that Tom Tripe is\nconstantly carrying letters from the Princess Yasmini of Sialpore to that\nyoung Prince Utirupa who was here this afternoon.  Now, it's no secret\nthat if Gungadhura Singh were to get found out committing treason\n(and I'm pretty sure he's guilty of it five days out of six!) we'd depose him--\"\n\n\"You mean the British would depose him?\"\n\n\"Depose him root and branch.  Then Utirtipa would be next in line.\nHe's a decent fellow.  He'd be sure of the nomination, and he'd make\na good ruler.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I want to know what the Princess Yasmini has to do with it.\"\n\n\"It seems to me you're not telling secrets, but asking favors for nothing.\"\n\n\"Not for nothing--not for nothing!  There's positively nothing that I won't do!\"\n\n\"In return for--?\"\n\n\"Sure information as to what is going on.\"\n\n\"Which you think I can get for you?\"\n\n\"I'm positive!  You're such an extraordinary, woman.  I'm pretty sure it\nall hinges on the treasure I told you about the other day.  Whoever gets\nfirst hold of that holds all the trumps.  I'd like to get it myself.  That would\nbe the making of me, politically speaking.  If Gungadhura should get\nit he'd ruin himself with intrigue in less than a year, but he might cause\nmy ruin in the process.  If the local priests should get it--and that's likeliest,\nall things considered--there'd be red ruin for miles around;  money and\nthe church don't mix without blood-letting, and you can't unscramble\nthat omelet forever afterward.  I confess I don't know how to checkmate\nthe priests.  Gungadhura I think I can manage, especially with your aid.\nBut I must have information.\"\n\n\"Is there any one else who'd be dangerous if he possessed the secret?\"\n\n\"Anybody would be, except myself.  Anybody else would begin playing\nfor political control with it, and there'd be no more peace on this side\nof India for years.  And now, this is what I want to say:  The most dangerous\nindividual who could possibly get that treasure would be the Princess\nYasmini.  The difficulty of dealing with her is that she's not above hiding\nbehind purdah (the veil), where no male man can reach her.  There\nare several women here whom I might interest in keeping an eye on her--\nTatum's wife, and Miss Bent, and Miss O'Hara, and the Goole sisters--\nlots of 'em.  But they'd all talk.  And they'd all try to get influence for\ntheir male connections on the strength of being in the know.  But somehow,\nTheresa, you're different.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Blaine, please.\"\n\n\"I know Tom Tripe thinks the world of you.  I want you to find out for\nme from him everything he knows about this treasure intrigue and\nwhatever's behind it.\"\n\n\"You think he'd tell me?\"\n\n\"Yes.  And I want you to make the acquaintance of the Princess Yasmini,\nand find out from her if you can what the letters are that she writes to\nUtirupa.  You'll find the acquaintance interesting.\"\n\nTess crumpled a folded letter in her left hand.\n\n\"If you could give me an introduction to the princess--they say she's\ndifficult to see--some sort of letter that would get me past the maharajah's\nguards,\" she answered.\n\n\"I can.  I will.  The girl's a minor.  I've the right to appoint some one to\nvisit her and make all proper inquiries.  I appoint you.\"\n\n\"Give me a letter now and I'll go tonight.\"\n\nHe stopped as they turned at the end of the path, and wrote on a leaf\nof his pocket-book.  Behind his back Tess waved her secret letter to\nattract Tom Tripe's notice, and nodded.\n\n\"There.\" said Samson.  \"That's preliminary.  I'll confirm it later by letter\non official paper.  But nobody will dare question that.  If any one does,\nlet me know immediately.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"And now, Theresa--\"\n\n\"You forget.\"\n\n\"I forget nothing.  I never forget!  You'll be wondering what you are to\nget out of all this--\"\n\n\"I wonder if you're capable of believing that nothing was further from\nmy thoughts!\"\n\n\"Don't think I want all for nothing!  Don't imagine my happiness--my\nsuccess could be complete without--\"\n\n\"Without a whisky and soda.  Come and have one.  I see my husband\ncoming at last.\"\n\n\"Damn!\" muttered Samson under his breath.\n\nShe had expected her husband by the big gate, but he came through\nthe little one, and she caught sight of him at once because through the\ncorner of her eye she was watching some one else--Umra the beggar.\nUmra departed through the little gate thirty seconds before her husband\nentered it.\n\nBlaine was so jubilant over a sample of crushed quartz he had brought\nhome with him that there was no concealing his high spirits.  He was\neven cordial to Samson, whom he detested, and so full of the milk of\nhuman kindness toward everybody else that they all wanted to stay and\nbe amused by him.  But Tess got rid of them at last by begging Samson\nto go first ostentatiously and set them an example, which he did after\nextracting a promise from her to see him tete-a-tete again at the\nearliest opportunity.\n\nThen Tess showed her husband the letter that Tom's dog had thrust\ninto her hand.\n\n\"You dine alone tonight, Dick, unless you prefer the club.  I'm going at\nonce.  Read this.\"\n\nIt was written in a fine Italic hand on expensive paper, with corrections\nhere and there as if the writer had obeyed inspiration first and consulted\na dictionary afterward--a neat letter, even neat in its mistakes.\n\n        \"Most precious friend,\" it ran, \"please visit me.  It is necessary that\n        you find some way of avoi--elu--tricking the guards, because there\n        are orders not to admit any one and not to let me out.  Please bring\n        with you food from your house, because I am hungry.  A cat and\n        two birds and a monkey have died from the food cooked for me.\n        I am also thirsty.  My mother taught me to drink wine, but the wine is\n        finished, and I like water the best.  Tom Tripe will try to help you past\n        the guards, but he has no brains, so you must give him orders.\n        He is very faithful.  Please come soon, and bring a very large\n        quantity of water.  Yours with love, YASMINI.\"\n\nHe read the letter and passed it back.\n\n\"D'you think it's on the level, Tess?\"\n\n\"I know it is!  Imagine that poor child, Dick, cooped up in a palace,\nstarving and parching herself for fear of poison!\"\n\n\"But how are you going to get to her?  You can't bowl over Gungadhura's\nguards with a sunshade.\"\n\n\"Samson wrote this for me.\"\n\nDick Blaine scowled.\n\n\"I imagine Samson's favors are paid for sooner or later.\"\n\n\"So are mine, Dick!  The beast has called me Theresa three times this\nafternoon, and has had the impudence to suggest that his preferment\nand my future happiness may bear some relation to each other.\"\n\n\"See here, Tess, maybe I'd better beat him and have done with it.\"\n\n\"No.  He can't corrupt me, but he might easily do you an injury.  Let him\nalone, Dick, and be as civil as you can.  You did splendidly this evening--\"\n\n\"Before I knew what he'd said to you!\"\n\n\"Now you've all the more reason to be civil.  I must keep in touch with\nthat young girl in the palace, and Samson is the only influence I can\ncount on.  Do as I say, Dick, and be civil to him.  Pretend you're not\neven suspicious.\"\n\n\"But say, that guy's suggestions aggregate an ounce or two!  First, I'm\nto draw Gungadhura's money while I hunt for buried treasure;  but I'm\nto tip off Samson first.  Second, I'm to look on while he makes his\npolitical fortune with my wife's help.  And third--what's the third thing, Tess?\"\n\nShe kissed him.  \"The third is that you're going to seem to be fooled\nby him, for the present at all events.  Let's know what's at the bottom\nof all this, and help the princess and Tom Tripe if it's possible.  Are\nyou tired?\"\n\n\"Yes. Why?\"\n\n\"If you weren't tired I was going to ask you to put a turban on as soon\nas it's dark, and dress up like a sais and drive me to Yasmini's palace,\nwith a revolver in each pocket in case of accidents, and eyes and ears\nskinned until I come out again.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm not too tired for that.\"\n\n\"Come along then.  I'll put up a hamper with my own hands.  You get\nwine from the cellar, and make sure the corks have not been pulled\nand replaced.  Then get the dog-cart to the door.  I'll keep it waiting\nthere while you run up-stairs and change.  Hurry, Dick, hurry--it's growing dark!\nI'll put some sandwiches under the seat for you to eat while you're waiting\nin the dark for me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Six\n\n\n\n\nAn Audit by the Gods\n\n(2)\n\nLoud laughed the gods (and their irony was pestilence;\nPain was in their mockery, affliction in their scorn.\nThe ryotwari cried\nOn a stricken countryside,\nFor the scab fell on the sheepfold and the mildew on the corn).\n\n\"Write, Chitragupta!*  Enter up your reckoning!\nYum** awaits in anger the assessment of the dead!\nWe left a law of kindness,\nBut they bowed themselves in blindness\nTo a cruelty consummate and a mystery instead!\n\n\"'Write, Chitragupta!

Look and wonder how the simple folk are out of it!\nEmpirics are the teachers and the liars leading men!\nWe were generous and free -\nAye, a social lot were we,\nBut they took to priests instead of us, and trouble started then!\"\n\n[* In Hindu mythology Yum is the judge of the dead and Chitragupta\nwrites the record for him.]\n\n\n\"Peace, Maharajah sahib!  Out of anger came no wise counsel yet!\"\n\nTom Tripp had done exactly what Yasmini ordered him.  Like his dog\nTrotters, whom he had schooled to perfection, and as he would have\nliked to have the maharajah's guards behave, he always fell back on\nsheer obedience whenever facts bewildered him or circumstances\nseemed too strong.\n\nYasmini had ordered him to report to the maharajah a chance encounter\nwith an individual named Gunga Singh.  Accordingly he did.  Asked\nwho Gunga Singh was, he replied he did not know.  She had told him\nto say that Gunga Singh said the Princess Yasmini was at the commissioner's\nhouse;  so he told the maharajah that and nothing further.  Gungadhura\nsent two men immediately to make inquiries.  One drew the commissioner's\nhouse blank, bribing a servant to let him search the place in Samson's\nabsence;  the other met the commissioner himself, and demanded of\nhim point-blank what he had been doing with the princess.  The question\nwas so bluntly put and the man's attitude so impudent that Samson lost\nhis temper and couched his denial in blunt bellicose bad language.\nThe vehemence convinced the questioner that he was lying, as the\nmaharajah was shortly informed.  So the fact became established beyond\nthe possibility of refutation that Yasmini had been closeted with Samson\nfor several hours that morning.\n\nRemained, of course, to consider why she had gone to him and what\nmight result from her visit;  and up to a certain point, and in certain cases\naccurate guessing is easier than might be expected for either side to\na political conundrum, in India, ample provision having been made for\nit by all concerned.\n\nThe English are fond of assuring strangers and one another that spying\nis \"un-English\";  that it \"isn't done, you know, old top\";  and the surest\nway of heaping public scorn and indignation on the enemies of England\nis to convict them, correctly or otherwise, of spying on England secretly.\nSo it would be manifestly libelous, ungentlemanly and proof conclusive\nof crass ignorance to assert that Samson in his capacity of commissioner\nemployed spies to watch Gungadhura Singh.  He had no public fund\nfrom which to pay spies.  If you don't believe that, then ponder over a\ncopy of the Indian Estimates.  Every rupee is accounted for.\n\nThe members of the maharajah's household who came to see Samson\nat more or less frequent intervals were individuals of the native community\nwhom he encouraged to intimacy for ethnological and social reasons.\nWhen they gave him information about Gungadhura's doings, that was\nmerely because they were incurably addicted to gossip;  as a gentleman,\nand in some sense a representative of His Majesty the King, he would\nnot dream, of course, of paying attention to any such stuff;  but one\ncould not, of course, be so rude and high-handed as to stop their talking\neven if it did tend toward an accurate foreknowledge of the maharajah's\ndoings that was hardly \"cricket.\"\n\nAs for money, certainly none changed hands.  The indisputable fact\nthat certain friends and relatives of certain members of the maharajah's\nhousehold enjoyed rather profitable contracts on British administered\nterritory was coincidence.  Everybody knows how long is the arm of\ncoincidence.  Well, then, so are its ears, and its tongue.\n\nAs for the maharajah, the rascal went the length of paying spies in British\ngovernment offices.  There was never any knowing who was a spy of\nhis and who wasn't.  People were everlastingly crossing the river from\nthe native state to seek employment in some government department\nor other, and one could not investigate them really thoroughly.  It was\nso easy to forge testimonials and references and what not.  One of\nSamson's grooms had once been caught red-handed eavesdropping\nin the dark.  Samson, of course, took the law into his own hands on\nthat occasion and thrashed the blackguard within an inch of his treacherous\nlife;  and in proof that the thrashing was richly deserved, some one\nreported to Samson the very next day how the groom had gone straight\nto the maharajah and had been solaced with silver money.\n\nIt was even said, although never proved, that the fat, short-sighted\nyoung babu Sita Ram who typed the commissioner's official correspondence\nwas one of Gungadhura's spies.  There was a mystery about where he\nspent his evenings.  But his mother's uncle was a first-class magistrate,\nso one could not very well dismiss him without clear proof.  Besides,\nhe was uncommonly painstaking and efficient.\n\nOne way and another it is easy to see that Gungadhura had a deal of\ndovetailed information from which to draw conclusions as to the probable\nreason of Yasmini's alleged visit to the commissioner.  One false\nconclusion invariably leads to another, and so Samson got the blame\nfor the secret bargain with the Rangar stable-owner, with whose connivance\nYasmini had contrived to keep a carriage available outside her palace\ngates.  Her palace gates having closed on the carriage now, the guards\nwould pay attention that it stayed inside, but there was no knowing how\nmany riding horses she might have at her beck and call in various khans\nand places.  Doubtless Samson had arranged for that.  Gungadhura\nsent men immediately to search Sialpore for horses that might be held\nin waiting for her, with orders to hire or buy the animals over her head,\nor in the alternative to lame them.\n\nAs for her motive in visiting the commissioner, that was not far to seek.\nThere was only one motive in Sialpore for anything--the treasure.  No\ndoubt Samson lusted for it as sinfully and lustily and craftily as any one.\nIf, thought Gungadhura, Yasmini had a clue to its whereabouts, as she\nmight have, then whoever believed she was not trafficking with the\ncommissioner must be a simpleton.  The commissioner was known\nto have written more than one very secret report to Simla on the subject\nof the treasure, and on the political consequences that might follow on\nits discovery by natives of the country.  The reports had been so secret\nand important that Gungadhura had thought it worth while to have the\nblotting paper from Samson's desk photographed in Paris by a special\nprocess.  Adding two and two together now by the ancient elastic process,\nGungadhura soon reached the stage of absolute conviction that Yasmini\nwas in league with Samson to forestall him in getting control of the\ntreasure of his ancestors;  and Gungadhura was a dark, hot-blooded,\nvolcanic-tempered man, who stayed not on the order of his anger but\nblew up at once habitually.\n\nWe have seen how he came careering down-street just in time to behold\nYasmini's carriage rumble into her stone-paved palace courtyard.  After\nordering the guards not to let her escape again on pain of unnamed,\nbut no less likely because illegal punishment, he rode full pelt to the\ntemple of Jinendra, whence they assured him Yasmini had just come,\nand his spurs rang presently on the temple floor like the footfalls of\navenging deity.\n\nJinendra's priest welcomed him with that mixture of deference and\npatronage that priests have always known so well how to extend to\nroyalty, showing him respect because priestly recognition of his royalty\nentitled him in logic to the outward form of it--patronage because, as\nthe \"wisest fool in Christendom\" remarked, \"No bishop no king!\"  The\ncombination of sarcastic respect and contemptuous politeness produced\nan insolence that none except kings would tolerate for a moment;  but\nJinendra's fat high priest could guess how far he dared go, as shrewdly\nas a marksman's guesses windage.\n\n\"She has betrayed us!  That foreign she-bastard has betrayed us!\"\nshouted Gungadhura, slamming the priest's private door behind him\nand ramming home the bolt as if it fitted into the breach of a rifle.\n\n\"Peace!  Peace, Maharajah sahib!  Out of anger came no wise counsel yet!\"\n\n\"She has been to the commissioner's house!\"\n\n\"I know it.\"\n\n\"You know it?  Then she told you?\"\n\nThe priest was about to lie, but Gungadhura saved him.\n\n\"I know she was here,\" he burst out.  \"My men followed her home.\"\n\n\"Yes, she was here.  She told.\"\n\n\"How did you make her tell?  The she-devil is more cunning than a cobra!\"\n\nJinendra's high priest smiled complacently.\n\n\"A servant of the gods, such as I am, is not altogether without power.\nI found a way.  She told.\"\n\n\"I, too, will find a way!\" muttered Gungadhura to himself.  Then to the\npriest:  \"What did she say?  Why did she go to the commissioner?\"\n\n\"To ask a favor.\"\n\n\"Of course!  What favor?\"\n\n\"That she may go to Europe.\"\n\n\"Then there is no longer any doubt whatever!  By Saraswati (the goddess\nof wisdom) I know that she has discovered where the treasure is!\"\n\n\"My son,\" said the priest, \"it is not manners to call on other gods by\nname in this place.\"\n\n\"By Jinendra, then!  Thou fat sedentary appetite, what a great god thine\nmust be, that he can choose no cleverer servant than thee to muddle\nhis affairs!\nWhile you were lulling me to sleep with dreams about a clue to be found\nin a cellar, she has already sucked the secret out from some cobra's\nhole and has sold it to the commissioner!  As soon as he has paid her\na proportion of it she will escape to Europe to avoid me--will she?\"\n\n\"But the commissioner refused the desired permission,\" said the priest,\npuffing his lips and stroking his stomach, as much as to add, \"It's no\nuse getting impatient in Jinendra's temple.  We have all the inside\ninformation here.\"\n\n\"What do you make of that?\" demanded Gungadhura.\n\nThe priest smiled.  One does not explain everything to a mere maharajah.\nBut the mere maharajah was in no mood to be put off with smiles just\nthen.  As Yasmini got the story afterward from the bald old mendicant,\nwhose piety had recently won him permission to bask on the comfortable\ncarved stones just outside the window, Gungadhura burst forth into\nsuch explosive profanity that the high priest ran out of the room.  The\nmendicant vowed that he heard the door slam--and so he did;  but it\nwas really Gungadhura, done with argument, on his way to put threat\ninto action.\n\nThe mildest epithet he called Yasmini was \"Widyadhara,\" which meant\nin his interpretation of the word that she was an evil spirit condemned\nto roam the earth because her sins were so awful that the other evil\nspirits simply could not tolerate her.\n\n\"It is plain that the commissioner fears to let her go to Europe!\" swore\nGungadhura.  \"Therefore it is plain that she and he have a plan between\nthem to loot the treasure and say nothing.  Neither trusts the other, as\nis the way of such people!  He will not let her out of sight until he can\nleave India himself!\"\n\n\"He has promised to send European memsahibs to call on her,\" said\nthe priest, and the maharajah gnashed his teeth and swore like a man\nstung by a hornet.\n\n\"That is to prevent me from using violence on her!  He will have frequent\nreports as to her health!  After a time, when he has his fingers in the\ntreasure, he will not be so anxious about her welfare!\"\n\n\"There was another matter that she told me,\" said the priest.\n\n\"Repeat it then, Belly-of-Jinendra!  Thy paunch retains a tale too long!\"\n\n\"Tripe, the drill-master, is a welcome guest at the house built by Jengal Singh.\"\n\n\"What of it?\"\n\n\"He may enter even when the sahibs are away from home.  The servants\nhave orders to admit him.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nThe priest smiled again.\n\n\"If it should chance to be true that the princess knows the secret of\nthe treasure, and that she is selling it to the commissioner, Tripe could\nenter that house and discover the clue.  Who could rob you of the\ntreasure once you knew the secret of its hiding-place?\"\n\nIt was at that point that the maharajah grew so exasperated at the thought\nof another's knowledge of a secret that he considered rightly his own\nby heritage, that his language exceeded not only the bounds of decorum\nbut the limits of commonplace blasphemy as well.  Turning his back\non the priest he rushed from the room, slamming the door behind him.\nAnd, being a ruminant fat mortal, the priest sat so still considering on\nwhich side of the equation his own bread might be buttered as to cause\nthe impression that the room was empty;  whereas only the maharajah\nhad left it.  And a little later the babu Sita Ram came in.\n\nGungadhura was in no mood to be trifled with.  He knew pretty well\nwhere to find Tom Tripe during any of the hours of duty, so he cornered\nhim without delay and, glaring at him with eyes like an animal's at bay,\nordered him to search the Blaine's house at the first opportunity.\n\n\"Search for what?\" demanded Tripe.\n\n\"For anything!  For everything!  Search the cellar;  search the garden;\nsearch the roof!  Are You a fool?  Are you fit for my employment?  Then\nsearch the house, and report to me anything unusual that you find in it!  Go!\"\n\nAfter several stiff brandies and soda Gungadhura then conceived a plan\nthat might have been dangerous supposing Yasmini to have been less\nalert, and supposing that she really knew the secret.  He spent an evening\ncoaching Patali, his favorite dancing girl, and then sent her to Yasmini\nwith almost full powers to drive a bargain.  She might offer as much as\nhalf of the treasure to Yasmini provided Gungadhura should receive\nthe other half and the British should know nothing.  That was the one\npoint on which Patali's orders permitted no discretion.  The whole\ntransaction must be secret from the British.\n\nReporting the encounter afterward to her employer Patali hardly seemed\nproud of her share in it.  All the information she brought back was to\nthe effect that Yasmini denied all knowledge of the treasure, and all\ndesire to possess it.\n\n\"I think she knows nothing.  She said very little to me.  She laughed at\nthe idea of bargaining with Englishmen.  She said you are welcome to\nthe treasure, maharajah sahib, and that if she should ever find its hiding-place\nshe will certainly tell you.  She plays the part of a woman whose spirit is\nalready broken and who is weary of India.\"\n\nHaving a very extensive knowledge of dancing girls and their ways,\nGungadhura did not believe much more than two per cent. of Patali's\naccount of what had taken place, and he was right, except that he grossly\noverestimated her truthfulness.  And even with his experienced cynicism\nit never entered his head to suppose that Patali was the individual who\nwarned Yasmini in advance of the preparations being made to poison\nher by Gungadhura's orders.  Yet, as it was Patali's own sister who made\nthe sweetmeats, and tampered with the charcoal for the filter, and put\nthe powdered diamonds in the chutney, it was likely enough that Patali\nwould know the facts;  and as for motives, dancing girls don't have them.\nThey fear, they love, they desire, they seek to please.  If Yasmini could\npluck heart-strings more cleverly than Gungadhura could break and bruise\nthem, so much the worse for Gungadhura's plans, that was all, as far\nas Patali was concerned.\n\nFor several days after that, as Yasmini more than hinted in her letter to\nTess, repeated efforts were made to administer poison in the careful\nundiscoverable ways that India has made her own since time immemorial.\nBut you can not easily poison any one who does not eat, and who drinks\nwine that was bottled in Europe;  or at any rate, to do it you must call in\nexperts who are expensive in the first place as well as adepts at blackmail\nin the second.  Yasmini enjoyed a charmed life and an increasing appetite,\nGungadhura's guards attending to it however, that she took no more\nforbidden walks and rides and swims by moonlight to make the hunger\nreally unendurable.  Supplies were allowed to pass through the palace\ngate, after they had been tampered with.\n\nFinally Gungadhura, biting his nails and drinking whisky in the intervals\nbetween consultation with a dozen different sets of priests, made up\nhis mind to drastic action.  It dawned on his exasperated mind that every\nsingle priest, including Jinendra's obese incumbent, was trying to take\nadvantage of his predicament in order to feather a priestly nest or forward\nplans diametrically opposed to his own.  (Not that recognition of priestly\ndeception made him less superstitious, or any less dependent on the\npriest;  if that were the way discovery worked, all priests would have\nvanished long ago.  It simply made him furious, like a tiger in a net,\nand spurred him to wreak damage in which the priests might have no hand.)\n\nWhisky, drugs, reflection and the hints of twenty dancing girls convinced\nhim that Jinendra's priest especially was playing a double game;  for\nwhat was there in the fat man's mental ingredients that should anchor\nhis loyalty to an ill-tempered prince, in case a princess of wit and youth\nand brilliant beauty should stake her cunning in the game?  Why was\nnot Yasmini already ten times dead of poison?  Nothing but the cunning\ninspired by partnership with priests, and alertness born of secret knowledge,\ncould have given her the intelligence to order her maids to boil a present\nof twenty pairs of French silk stockings--nor the malice to hang them\nafterward with her own hands on a line across her palace roof in full\nview of Gungadhura's window!\n\nHatred of Yasmini was an obsession of his in any case.  He had loathed\nher mother, who dared try to wear down the rule that women must be\nveiled.  Even his own dancing girls were heavily veiled in public, and\nall his relations with women of any sort took place behind impenetrable\nscreens.  He was a stickler for that sort of thing and, like others of his\nkidney, rather proud of the rumors that no curtains could confine.  So\nhe loathed and despised Yasmini even more than he had detested\nher mother, because she coupled to her mother's Western notions\nabout freedom a wholly Eastern ability to take advantage of restraint.\nIn other words she was too clever for him.\n\nOn top of all that she had dared outrage his royal feelings by refusing\nto be given in marriage to the husband be selected for her--a fine, black-\nbristling, stout cavalier of sixty with a wife or two already and impoverished\nestates that would have swallowed Yasmini's fortune nicely at a gulp.\nIncidentally, the husband would have eagerly canceled a gambling debt\nin exchange for a young wife with an income.\n\nThere was no point at which Yasmini and himself could meet on less\nthan rapier terms.  Her exploits in disguise were notorious--so notorious\nthat men sang songs about them in the drinking places and the khans.\nAnd as if that were not bad enough there was a rumor lately that she\nhad turned Abhisharika.  The word is Sanskrit and poetic.  To the ordinary\nfolk, who like to listen to love-stories by moonlight on the roofs or under\ntrees, that meant that she had chosen her own lover and would go to\nhim, when the time should come, of her own free will.  To Gungadhura,\nnaturally, such a word bore other meanings.  As we have said, he was\na stickler for propriety.\n\nLast, and most uncomfortable crime of all, it seemed that she had now\narranged with Samson to have English ladies call on her at intervals.\nNot a prophet on earth could guess where that might lead to, and to\nwhat extremes of Western fashion;  for though one does not see the\nhigh-caste women of Rajputana, they themselves see everything and\nknow all that is going on.  But it needed no prophet to explain that a\nwoman visited at intervals by the wives of English officers could not\nbe murdered easily or safely.\n\nAll arguments pointed one way.  He must have it out with Yasmini in\none battle royal.  If she should be willing to surrender, well and good.\nHe would make her pay for the past, but no doubt there were certain\nconcessions that he could yield without loss of dignity.  If she knew\nthe secret of the hiding-place of the treasure he would worm it out of her.\nThere are ways, he reflected, of worming secrets from a woman--ways\nand means.  If she knew the secret and refused to tell, then he knew\nhow to provide that she should never tell any one else.  If she had told\nsome one else already,--Samson, for instance, or Jinendra's priest--\nthen he would see to it that priest or commissioner, as the case might be,\nmust carry on without the cleverest member of the firm.\n\nBut he must hurry.  Poison apparently would not work and he did not\ndare murder her outright, much as he would have liked to.  It was\nmaddening to think how one not very violent blow with a club or a knife\nwould put an end to her wilfulness forever, and yet that the risk to\nhimself in that case would be almost as deadly as the certainty for her.\nBut accidents might happen.  In a land of elephants, tigers, snakes,\nwild boars and desperate men there is a wide range for circumstance,\nand the sooner the accident the less the risk of interference by some\ninquisitive English woman with a ticket-of-admission signed by Samson.\n\nAn \"accident\" in Yasmini's palace, he decided would be nearly as risky\nas murder.  But he had a country-place fifty miles away in the mountains,\nto which she could be forcibly removed, thus throwing inquisitive\nEnglishwomen off the scent for a while at any rate.  That secluded\nlittle hunting box stood by a purple lake that had already drowned its\ndozens, not always without setting up suspicion;  and between the city\nof Sialpore and the \"Nesting-place of Seven Swans\" lay leagues of wild\nroad on which anything at all might happen and be afterward explained away.\n\nAs for the forcible abduction, that could best be got around by obliging\nher to write a letter to himself requesting permission to visit the mountains\nfor a change of air and scenery.  There were ways and means of obliging\nwomen to write letters.\n\nBest of all, of course, would be Yasmini's unconditional surrender,\nbecause then he would be able to make use of her wits and her information,\ninstead of having to explain away her \"accident\" and cope alone with\nany one whom she might already have entrusted with her secret.  There\nshould be a strenuous effort first to bring her to her senses.  Physical\npain, he had noticed, had more effect on people's senses than any\namount of argument.  There had been a very amusing instance recently.\nOne of his dancing girls named Malati had refused recently to sing\nand dance her best before a man to whom Gungadhura had designed\nto make a present of her;  but the mere preliminaries of removing a\ntoe-nail behind the scenes had changed her mind within three minutes.\n\nThen there were other little humorous contrivances.  There is a way\nof tying an intended convert to your views in such ingenious fashion\nthat the lightest touch of a finger on taut catgut stretched from limb to\nlimb, causes exquisite agony.  And a cigarette end, of course, applied\nin such circumstances to the tenderer parts has great power to persuade.\n\nAs to accomplices, those must be few and carefully chosen.  Alone\nagainst Yasmini he knew he would have no chance whatever, for she\nwas physically stronger than a panther, and as swift and graceful.  But\nthere are creatures, not nearly yet extinct from Eastern courts, known\nas eunuchs, whose strongest quality is seldom said to be mercy, and\nwhose chief business in life is to be amenable to orders and to guard\nwith their lives their master's secrets.  Three were really too many to\nbe let into such a secret;  but it had needed two to hold Malati properly\nwhile the third experimented on the toe-nail, and Yasmini was much\nstronger than Malati;  so he must chance it and take three.\n\nThe only remaining problem did not trouble him much.  The palace\nguards were his own men, and were therefore not likely to question\nhis right to ignore the first law of purdah that forbids the crossing of\na woman's threshold, especially after dark, unless she is your property.\nBesides, they all knew already what sort of prowl-by-night their master\nwas, and laws, especially such laws, were, made for other people, not\nfor maharajahs.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Seven\n\n\n\n\nA bloody enlisted man--that's me,\nA peg in the officer's plan--maybe.\nDrunk on occasion, Disgrace to a nation\nAnd proper societee.\nYet I've a notion the sky--pure blue\nAin't more essential than I--clear through.\nI'm a man.  I can think.\nIn the chain of eternal\nAffairs I'm a link,\nAnd the chain ain't no stronger than me--or you.\n\n\n\"That will be the end of Gungadhura!\"\n\nIt took longer to get the hamper ready than Tess expected, partly because\nit did not seem expedient to have the butler Chamu in the secret.  By\nthe time she and her husband were up side by side in the dog-cart there\nwas already a nearly full moon silvering the sky, and the jackals were\nyelping miserably on the hillside.  Before they reached the stifling town\na slow breeze had moved the river-mist, until a curtain shut off the whole\nof the bazaar and merchants' quarters from the better residential section\nwhere the palaces stood.  It was an ideal night for adventure;  an almost\nperfect night for crime;  one could step from street to street and leave\nno clue, because of the drifting vapor.\n\nHere and there a solitary policeman coughed after they had passed,\nor slunk into a shadow lest they recognize and report him for sleeping\nat his post.  All sahibs have unreasonable habits, and not even a constable\ncan guess which one will not make trouble for him.  An occasional stray\ndog yapped at the wheels, and more than once heads peered over\nroof-tops to try and glimpse them, because gossip--especially about\nsahibs who are out after dark--is a coinage of its own that buys welcome\nand refreshment almost anywhere.  But nothing in particular happened\nuntil the horse struck sparks from the granite flagstones outside Yasmini's\ngate, and a sleepy Rajput sentry brought his rifle to the challenge.\n\nThen it was not exactly obvious what to do next.  Tess felt perfectly\nconfident on the high seat, with the pistol in her husband's pocket pressing\nagainst her and his reassuring bulk between her and the sentry;  but\neverywhere else was insecurity and doubt.  One does not as a rule\ndescend from dog-carts after dark and present half-sheets of paper by\nway of passports for admission to Rajput palaces.  The sentry looked\nmildly interested, no more.  He had been so thoroughly warned and\nthreatened in case of efforts to escape from within, that it did not enter\nhis head that any one might want to enter.  However, since the dog-cart\ncontinued to stand still in front of the gate, he turned the guard out as\na matter of routine;  one never knew when sahibs will not complain\nabout discourtesy.\n\nThe guard lined up at attention--eight men and a risaldar (officer)--double\nthe regular number by Gungadhura's orders.  The risaldar stepped\nup close to the dog-cart and spoke to the man he imagined was the\nsais, using, as was natural, the Rajput tongue.  But Dick Blaine only\nknew enough of the language for fetch and carry purposes--not enough\nto deceive a native as to his nationality after the first two words.\n\n\"Now I feel foolish!\" said Tess, and the risaldar of the guard thrust his\nbearded face closer, supposing she spoke to him.  Dick answered her.\n\n\"Shall I drive you home again, little woman?  Say, the word and we're off.\"\n\n\"Not yet.  I haven't tried my ammunition.\"\n\nShe pulled out Samson's scribbled permit and was about to offer it to\nthe guard.  But there was a risk that whatever she did would only arouse\nand increase his suspicions, and she offered it nervously.\n\n\"What if he won't give it back to you?\" asked her husband.\n\n\"Oh, Dick, you're a regular prophet of evil tonight!\"\n\nHowever, she withdrew the paper before the guard's fingers, closed\non it.  The next moment a figure like a phantom, making no noise, almost\nmade her scream.  Dick produced a repeating pistol with that sudden\nswiftness that proves old acquaintance with the things, and the corporal\nof the guard sprang back with a shout of warning to his men, imagining\nthe pistol was intended for himself.  Tess recovered presence of mind first.\n\n\"It's all right, Dick.  Put the gun out of sight.\"\n\nShe stretched out her hand and a cold nose touched her finger-ends,\nsniffing them.  A dog's forefeet were on the shaft, and his eyes gleamed\nbalefully in the carriage lamp light.\n\n\"Good Trotters!  Good boy, Trotters!\"\n\nShe remembered Tom Tripe's lecture about calling dogs by name,\nwondering whether the rule applied to owners only, or whether she,\ntoo, could make the creature \"do this own thinking.\"  Before she could\ndecide what she would like the dog to think about he was gone again\nas silently as he had come.  The guard was thoroughly on the qui vive\nby that time, if not suspicious, then officious.  How should one protect\nthe privacy of a palace gate if unknown memsahibs in dog-carts, with\nsaises who knew English but did not answer when spoken to in the\nnative tongue, were to be allowed to draw up in front of the gate at\nunseemly hours and remain there indefinitely.  The risaldar ordered\nTess away without further ceremony, making his meaning plain by\ntaking the horse's head and starting him.\n\nDick Blaine drew the horse back on his haunches and cursed the man\nfor that piece of impudence, in language and with mannerisms that\nbanished forever any delusions as to his nationality;  and it occurred to\nthe officer that his extra complement of men, standing in a row like\ndummies at attention, were not there after all for nothing.  He despatched\ntwo of them at a run to Gungadhura's palace, the one to tell the story\nof what had happened and the other to add to it whatever the first might\nomit.  Between them they were likely to produce results of some sort.\n\n\"Now we're done for!\" sighed Tess.  \"No chance tonight, I'm afraid.\nIf only I'd done what she told me to and consulted with Tom Tripe first.\nBetter drive home now, Dick, before we make the case worse.\"\n\nThe unreasonableness of the attempt convinced and discouraged her.\nIt was like a nightmare.  But as Dick reined the horse about there came\nout of the mist the sound of another horse at a walk, and two men\nmarching in step.  Then a man's voice broke the stillness.  Dick reined in,\nand a second later Trotters' huge paws rested on the shaft again.\nTess could see his long, unenthusiastic tail wagging to and fro.\n\n\"Tom!\" she called. \"Tom Tripe!\"\n\n\"Coming, lady!\"\n\nThree figures emerged out of the gloom, one of them mounted and loquacious.\n\n\"I'd like to know what these rascally guards are doing off their post!\nGive these sons of camp-followers an inch and they'll take three leagues,\nevery mother's son of them!  Halt, there, you!  Now then, where's your\nofficer?  Give an account of yourselves!\"\n\nThere followed an interlude in Rajasthani.*  Tom Tripe becoming more\nblasphemously vehement as it grew clearer that the risaldar had done\nentirely right.\n[* The native language of Rajputana.]\n\n\"Lady,\" he said presently, riding round to Tess's side of the dog-cart.\n\"I'm going to have hard work to convince this man.  I'd orders from\nGungadhura to search your house, Krishna knows what for, and I rode\nup to ask your leave to do it, hoping you'd be alone after the party.\nChamu told me you and your husband had gone out, and one of the\nthree beggars gave me a message intended for you that tallied pretty\nclose with one I knew you'd received already, so I guessed where to\nhead for, and sent the dog in advance.  He came back with his hair on\nend reporting trouble, and then as luck would have it I rode into these\ntwo men on their way to Gungadhura.  If they'd reached him, we'd all\nhave had to make new plans tomorrow morning!  You want to see the\nprincess, of course?  But what have you got that can get by the guard?\"\n\nTess produced Samson's scribbled note, and he studied it in the carriage\nlamplight.  Then she recalled Yasmini's warning that Tom Tripe had no\nbrains and must be told what to do.  Her own wits began to work desperately.\n\n\"I'm the lady doctor, Tom.  That is my written order from the burra\nsahib.\" (Commissioner).\n\nTom scratched his head and swore in a low voice fervently.\n\n\"The difficulty's this, lady:  since the escape from the palace across\nthe river, the maharajah has taken the posting of palace guards out of\nmy hands entirely.  I've still the duty to inspect and make sure they're\non the job--Oh, I see!  I have it!\"\n\nHe turned on the corporal with all the savagery that the white man\ngenerates in contact with Eastern subordinates.\n\n\"What do you mean,\" he demanded in the man's own language, \"by\nstanding in the way of the maharajah sahib's orders?  Here's his highness\nsending a lady doctor to the princess for an excuse to confine her\nelsewhere and have all this trouble off our hands, and you, like a\nblockhead, stand in the way to prevent it!  See--there's the letter!\"\n\nThe Rajput looked perplexed.  All the world knows what privileges the\nrare American women doctors enjoy in that land of sealed seraglios.\n\n\"But it is written in English,\" he objected.  \"The maharajah sahib does\nnot write English.\"\n\n\"Idiot!  Of what use would a letter in Persian be to an American lady doctor?'\n\n\"But to me?  It is I who command the guard and must read the letter.\nHow can I read the letter?\"\n\n\"I'll read it to you.  What's more, I'll explain it.  The princess has been\nappealing to the commissioner sahib--\"\n\nThe Rajput nodded.  It was all over town that Yasmini had been closeted\nwith the commissioner on the morning of her recent escape.  She\nherself had deliberately sown the seeds of that untruth.\n\n\"So the commissioner sahib and the maharajah sahib had a conference--\"\n\nThe Rajput nodded again.  It was common knowledge, too that the\ncommissioner and Gungadhura had had a rather stormy interview the\nday before;  and it was none of the corporal's privilege to know that\nall they had argued about was the ill-treatment of prisoners in the Sialpore jail.\n\n\"--It was agreed at the conference that if the princess can be proved\nmad, then the maharajah sahib may do as he's minded about sending\nher away into the hills.  If she's not mad, then he's to give her her liberty.\nDo you understand, you dunderhead?\"\n\n\"Hah! I understand.  But why at night?  Why not the maharajah sahib's\nsignature in his own writing?\"\n\n\"Son of incomprehension!  Does the maharajah sahib wish still more\nscandal than already has been by permitting such a visit in the daytime?\nStrike me everlasting dumb if he hasn't had more than enough already!\nDoes he want the responsibility?  Does he wish the British to say\nafterward that it was all the maharajah's doing?  No, you ass!  At the\nconference be agreed solely on condition that the commissioner sahib\nshould sign the letter and relieve his highness of all blame in case of\na verdict of madness.  And it was decided to send an American, lest\nthere be too much talk among the British themselves.  Now, do\nyou understand?\"\n\n\"Hah!  I understand.  If all this is true the matter is easy.  I will send\none of the guard with that letter to the maharajah sahib.  He will write\nhis name on it and send it back, and all is well.\"\n\n\"Suit yourself!\" sneered Tom Tripe.  \"The maharajah sahib is with his\ndancing girls this minute.  What happened to the last man who interrupted\nhis amusements?\"\n\nThe Rajput hesitated.  The answer to that question could be seen any\nday near the place they call the Old Gate, where beggars sit in rags.\n\n\"Shall I offer him money?\" whispered Tess.\n\n\"For God's sake, no, lady!  The man's a decent soldier.  He'd refuse\nit and we'd all be in the apple-cart!  Leave him to me.\"\n\nHe turned again on the Rajput.\n\n\"You know who I am, don't you?  You know it's my duty to see that the\npalace guards attend to business, eh?  That's why I'm here tonight.\nHis highness particularly warned me to see that if anything unusual\nwanted doing it should get done.  If you want to question my authority\nyou'll have it out with me before his highness in the morning first thing.\"\n\nThe Rajput obviously wavered.  Everybody knew that the first thing in\nthe morning was no good time to appear on charges before a man\nwho spent his nights as Gungadhura did.\n\n\"Who is to enter?  A man and a woman?\"\n\n\"No, you idiot!  A lady doctor only.  And nobody's to know.  You'd better\nwarn your men that if there's any talk about this night's business the\npalace guard will catch the first blast of the typhoon.  Gungadhura's\nanger isn't mild in these days!\"\n\n\"Show me the letter again,\" said the Rajput.  \"Let me keep it in case\nI am brought to book.\"\n\nTom translated that to Tess and her husband.\n\n\"It's this way, ma'am.  If you let him keep the letter I suspect he'll let\nyou go in.  But he may show it to the maharajah in the morning, and\nthen there'll be hot fat in the fire.  If you don't let him keep it, perhaps\nhe'll admit you and perhaps he won't;  but if you keep the letter, and\ntrouble comes of it, he and I'll both be in the soup!  Never mind\nabout me.  Maybe I'm too valuable to be sent packing.  I'll take the\nchance.  But this man's a decent soldier, and he'd be helpless.\"\n\n\"Let him keep it,\" said Tess.\n\nTom turned on the Rajput again.\n\n\"Here's the letter.  Take it.  But mark this!  What his highness wants\ntonight is discretion.  There might be promotion for a man who'd say\nnothing about this night's work.  If, on top of that, he was soldier enough\nto keep his men from talking he'd be reported favorably to his highness\nby Tom Tripe.  Who got you made risaldar, eh?  Who stood up for you,\nwhen you were charged with striking Gullam Singh?  Was Tom Tripe's\nfriendship worth having then?  Now suit yourself!  I've said all I'm\ngoing to say.\"\n\nThe Rajput muttered something in his beard, stared again at the letter\nas if that of itself would justify him, looked sharply at Tess, whose hamper\nmight or might not be corroborative evidence, folded the letter away\nin his tunic pocket, and made a gesture of assent.\n\n\"Now, lady, hurry!\" said Tom.  \"And here's hoping you're right about\nthere being no hell!  I've told lies enough tonight to damn my soul forever!\nOnce you're safely through the gate I'll have a word or two more with\nthe guard, and then your husband and I will go to a place close by that\nI know of and wait for you.\"\n\nBut Tess objected to that.  \"Please don't leave me waiting for you in\nthe dark outside the gate when I return!  Why not keep the carriage here;\nmy husband won't mind.\"\n\n\"Might make talk, ma'am.  I'll leave Trotters here to watch for you.  He'll\nbring word in less than a minute.\"\n\nTom Tripe dismounted to help her out of the dog-cart.  The Rajput\nstruck the iron gate as if he expected to have to wake the dead and\ntake an hour about it.  But it opened suspiciously quickly and a bearded\nAfridi, of all unlikely people, thrust an expectant face outward, rather\nlike a tortoise emerging from its shell, blinking as he tried to recognize\nthe shadowy forms that moved in the confusing lamplight.  He seemed\nto know whom to expect and admit, for he beckoned Tess with a long\ncrooked forefinger the moment she approached the gate, and in another\nten seconds the iron clanged behind her, shutting her off from husband\nand all present hope of succor.  The chance of any rescuer entering\nthe palace that night, whether by force or subtlety, was infinitesimal.\n\nThe strange gateman--he had a little kennel of a place to sleep in just\ninside the entrance--snatched the hamper from Tess and led her almost\nat a run across an ancient courtyard whose outlines were nearly invisible\nexcept where the yellow light of one ancient oil lantern on an iron bracket\nshowed a part of the palace wall and a steep flight of stone steps, worn\ndown the middle by centuries of sandals.  Everything else was in gloom\nand shadow, and only one chink of light betrayed the whereabouts of\na curtained window.  The Afridi led her up the stone steps, and paused\nat the top to hammer on a carved door with his clenched fist;  but the\ndoor moved while his fist was in mid-air, and the merry-eyed maid who\nopened it mocked him for a lunatic.  Dumb, apparently, in the presence\nof woman, he slunk down the steps again, leaving Tess wondering\nwhether it were not good manners to remove her shoes before entering.\nNatives of the country always removed their shoes before entering\nher house, and she supposed it would be only decent to reciprocate.\n\nHowever, the maid took her by the hand and pulled her inside without\nfurther ceremony, not letting go of the hand even to close the door, but\npatting it and making much of her, smiling the welcome that they had\nno words in common to express.  The little outer hall in which they stood\nwas shut off by curtains six yards high, all smothered in a needlework\nof peacocks that generations of patient fingers must have toiled at.\nPulling these apart the maid led her into an inner hall fifty or sixty feet\nlong, the first sight of which banished all diffidence about her shoes;\nfor never had she seen such medley of East and West, such toning\ndown of Oriental mysticism with the sheer utility of European importations;\nand that without incongruity.\n\nThe lamps, of which there were dozens, were mostly Russian.  Some\nof the furniture was Buhl, some French.  There were hangings that\nlooked like loot from the Pekin Summer Palace, and tapestry from\nGobelin.  In a place of honor on a side wall was an ikon, framed in gold,\nand facing that an image of the Buddha done in greenish bronze,\nflanked by a Dutch picture of the Twelve Apostles with laughably Dutch\nfaces receiving instruction on a mountain from a Christ whose other\nname was surely Hans.\n\nDown the center of the hall, leading to a gallery, was a magnificent\nstairway of marble and lapis lazuli, carpeted with long Bokhara strips\nso well joined end to end that the whole looked like one piece.  And\nat the top of those stairs Yasmini stood waiting, her golden hair illuminated\nby glass lamps on either marble column at the stairhead.  She was as\ndifferent from the Gunga Singh of riding boots and turban as the morning\nis from night--the loveliest, bewitchingest girl in silken gossamer that\nTess had ever set eyes on.\n\n\"I knew you would come!\" she shouted gleefully.  \"I knew you would\nget in!  I knew you are my friend!  Oh, I'm glad!  I'm glad!\"\n\nShe pirouetted a dozen times on bare toes at the top of the stairs,\nspinning until her silken skirts expanded in a nimbus, then danced\ndown-stairs into Tess's arms, where she clung, panting and laughing.\n\n\"I'm so hungry!  Oh, I'm hungry!  Did you bring the food?\"\n\n\"I'm ashamed!\" Tess answered.  \"The man set it down outside the\ndoor and I left it there.\"\n\nBut Yasmini gave a little shrill of delight, and Tess turned to see that\nanother maid had brought it.\n\n\"How many of you are there?\"\n\n\"Five.\"\n\n\"Thank heaven!  I've brought enough for a square meal for a dozen.\"\n\n\"We have eaten a little, little bit each day of the servants' rice, washing\nit first for hours, until today, when two of the servants were taken sick\nand we thought perhaps their food was poisoned too.  Oh, we're hungry!\"\n\nHasamurti, Yasmini's maid, opened the basket on the floor and crowed\naloud.  Tess apologized.\n\n\"I knew nothing about the caste restrictions, but I've put in meat jelly--\nand bread--and fruit--and rice--and nuts--and milk--and tea--and wine--\nand sugar--\"\n\nYasmini laughed.\n\n\"I am as Western as I choose to be, and only pretend to caste when\nI see fit.  My maids do as I do, or they seek another mistress.  Come!\"\n\nHasamurti would have spread a banquet there on the floor, but Yasmini\nled them up-stairs, holding Tess by the hand, turning to the right at the\nstairhead into a room all cream and golden, lighted by hanging lamps\nthat shone through disks of colored glass.  There she pulled Tess\ndown beside her on to a great soft divan and they all ate together, the\nmaids munching their share while they served their mistress.  They\ndevoured the milk, and left the wine, eating, all things considered,\nastonishingly moderately.\n\n\"Now we ought all to go to sleep,\" announced Yasmini, yawning, and\nthen bubbling with delighted laughter at the expression of Tess's face.\n\"The people outside might wait!\"\n\n\"Great heavens, child.  Do you suppose I can stay here indefinitely?\"\nTess demanded.  \"I must be gone in an hour or my husband will\nmurder the guard and force an entrance!\"\n\n\"I will have just such a husband soon,\" announced Yasmini.  \"When I\nsend him one little word, he will cut the throats of thirty men and come\nto me through flames!  Let us try your husband,\" she added as an\nafterthought--then laughed again at Tess's expression of dissent,\nand nodded.\n\n\"I, too, will be careful how I risk my husband!  Men are but moths in a\nwoman's hands--fragile--but the good ones are precious.  Besides,\nwe have no time tonight for sport.  I must escape.\"\n\nEvidently Tess was causing her exquisite amusement.  The thought\nof being an accomplice in any such adventure stirred all her Yankee\ncommon sense to its depths, and she had none of the Eastern trick\nof not displaying her emotions.\n\n\"Nonsense, child!  Let me go to the commissioner and warn him that\nyou are being starved to death in this place.  I will threaten him with\npublic scandal if he doesn't put an end to it at once.\"\n\n\"Pouf!\" laughed Yasmini.  \"Samson sahib would make a nice clumsy\naccomplice!  He would send me to Calcutta, where I should be poisoned\nsooner or later for a certainty, because Gungadhura would send agents\nto attend to that.  They would wait months and months for their opportunity,\nand I can not always stay awake.  Meanwhile Samson sahib would\nclaim praise from his government, and they would put some more initials\nat the end of his name, and promote him to a bigger district with more pay.\nNo!  Samson sahib shall have another district surely, but even he in\nhis conceit will not consider it promotion!  There will not be room for\nSamson sahib in Sialpore when I am maharanee!\"\n\n\"You maharanee?  It was you yourself who told me that Gungadhura\nhas lots of children, who all stand between you and the throne.  Do\nyou mean--?\"\n\nAgain the bell-like laugh announced utter enjoyment of Tess's bewilderment.\n\n\"No, I will kill nobody.  I will not even send snakes in a basket to Gungadhura.\nThat scorpion shall sting himself to death if he sees fit, with a ring of\nthe fire of ridicule all about him and no friends to console him, and no\nhope--nothing but disappointment and fear and rage!  I will kill nobody.\nYet I will be maharanee within the month!\"\n\nSuddenly she grew deadly serious, her young face darkening as the\nsky does when a quick cloud hides the sun.\n\n\"What is your husband's contract with Gungadhura?  May he dig for\ngold anywhere?  He is digging now, isn't he, close to the British fort\non the 'island' in our territory--that fort with the flagstaff on it that can\nbe seen from Gungadhura's roof?  He is wasting time!\"\n\n\"He has found a little vein of gold,\" said Tess, \"that will likely lead to a\nbigger vein.\"\n\n\"He is wasting time!  Sita Ram, who has a compass, and who knows\nall that goes on in Samson sahib's office, sent me word that the little\nvein of gold runs nearly due north.  In another week at the rate the men\nare digging your husband will be under the fort.  That is English territory.\nThe English have nothing to do with Gungadhura's contract.  They will\ntake the gold your husband finds and give him nothing.  Then Samson\nsahib would be considered a most excellent commissioner and would\nsurely get promotion!  Pouf!\"\n\n\"Perhaps my husband can make a separate bargain with the English.\"\n\n\"Pouf!  Samson sahib is an idiot, but he is not fool enough to give away\nwhat would be in his hands already!  I myself, hidden beneath your\nwindow, heard him give you clear warning on that point!  No, there must\nbe another plan.  Your husband must dig elsewhere.\"\n\n\"But, my dear, Gungadhura knows already that my husband has found\na 'leader.'  He is all worked up about it, and goes every day to watch\nthe progress.\"\n\n\"Surely--knowing as well as I do that the vein is leading toward the fort.\nHe goes afterward to the priests, and prays that the vein of gold may\nturn another way and save him from bankruptcy!  Listen?  I speak truth!\nI speak to you woman to woman--womb to womb!  I will count myself\naccursed, and will let a cobra bite me if I tell you now one word that is\nnot true!  Do you believe I am going to tell you the truth?\"\n\nTess nodded.  Yasmini, by her own admission, would lie deliberately\nwhen that suited her;  but the truth tells itself, as it were, and there is\nno mistaking it, except by such as lie invariably, of whom there is a\nmultifarious host.\n\n\"If your husband continues digging near the fort he will get nothing,\nbecause the English will take it all.  If he digs in a certain other place\nhe will get a very great fortune!\"\n\n\"But, my dear, supposing that is quite true, how shall he convince\nGungadhura, after all the outlay and expense of the present operations,\nthat it's best to abandon them and begin all over again in another place?\"\n\nYasmini lay back on the cushions, drew something out from under one\nof them, and laughed softly, as if enjoying a deep underflow of\nsecret information.\n\n\"Gungadhura himself shall insist on it!\"\n\n\"What?  On starting again in a new place?\"\n\nYasmini nodded.\n\n\"Only do as I say, and Gungadhura himself shall insist.\"\n\n\"What do you wish me to do?\"\n\nTess was beginning to feel alarmed again.  She knew to a rupee how\nmuch Gungadhura had been obliged to pay out for the digging.  To\nmake herself\nresponsible even in degree for the abandonment of all that outlay would\nbe risky, even if no other construction could be placed on it.\n\n\"Has Tom Tripe been told to search your house?\"\n\n\"Yes, so he says.\"\n\n\"Do you know the cellar of your house?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"It is dark.  Are you afraid to go there?\"\n\n\"No. Why?\"\n\n\"Is there a flat stone in a corner of the cellar floor that once had a ring\nin it but the ring is broken out?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Good.  Then Sita Ram did not lie to me.  Take this.\"  She gave her a\nlittle silver tube, capped at either end and sealed heavily with wax.\n\"There is a writing inside it--done in Persian.  Hide that under the stone,\nand let Tom Tripe search the cellar and find it there;  but forbid him\nto remove it.\"\n\n\"If I only knew what you are driving at!\" said Tess with a wry smile.\n\nA clumsier conspirator might have lost the game at that point by\nover-emphasis, for Tess was wavering between point-blank refusal\nand delay that would give her time to consult her husband.  But Yasmini,\neven at that age, was adept at feeling her way nicely.  Again she lay\nback on the cushion, and this time lit a cigarette, smoking lazily.\n\n\"The stake that I am playing for--the stake that I shall surely win,\" she\nsaid after a minute, \"is too big to be risked.  If you are afraid, let us\nforget all that I have said.  Let us be friends and nothing more.\"\n\nTess did not answer.  She recognized the appeal to her own pride,\nand ignored it.  What she was thinking of was Gungadhura's beastliness--\nhis attempts to poison Yasmini--his treatment of women generally--\nhis cruelty to animals in the arena--his viciousness;  and then, of how\nmuch more queenly if nothing else, this girl would likely be than ever\nGungadhura could be kingly.  It was tempting enough to have a hand\nin substituting Yasmini for Gungadhura on the throne of Sialpore if the\nchance of doing it were real.\n\nYasmini seemed able to read her thoughts, or at all events to guess them.\n\n\"When I am maharanee,\" she said, \"there will be an end of Gungadhura's\nswinishness.  Moreover, promises will all be kept, unwritten ones as\nwell as written.  Gungadhura's contracts will be carried out.  Do you\nbelieve me?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think I believe that.\"\n\n\"Let Tom Tripe find that silver tube in your cellar then.  But listen!  When\nGungadhura comes to your husband and insists on digging elsewhere,\nlet your husband bargain like a huckster!  Let him at first refuse.  It may\nbe that Gungadhura will let him continue where he digs, and will himself\nsend men to start digging in the other place.  In that case, well and good.\"\n\n\"I would prefer that, said Tess.  \"My husband is a mining engineer.\nI think he would hate to abandon a true lead for a whim of some one's else.\"\n\nYasmini's bright eyes gleamed intelligence.  She was only learning in\nthose days to bend people to her own imperious will and to use others'\nvirtues for own ends as readily as their vices.  She recognized the\nnecessity of yielding to Tess's compunctions, more than suspecting\nthat Dick Blaine would color his own views pretty much to suit his wife's\nin any case.  And with a lightning ability peculiar to her she saw how to\nimprove her own plan by yielding.\n\n\"That is settled, then,\" she said lazily.  \"Your husband shall continue to\ndig near the fort, if he so wishes.  But let him show Samson sahib some\nspecimens of the gold--how little it is--how feeble--how uncertain.  Be\nsure he does that, please.  That will be the end of Gungadhura.  And\nnow it is time to escape from here, and for you to help me.\"\n\nTess resigned herself to the inevitable.  Whatever the consequences,\nshe was not willing to leave Yasmini to starve or be poisoned.\n\n\"I'm ready!\" she said.  \"What's the plan?\"\n\n\"I shall leave all the maids behind.  They have food enough for the\nmorning.  In the morning, after it is known that I have escaped, word\nshall be sent to Samson sahib that the women in this palace have\nnothing but poisoned food to eat.  He must beard Gungadhura about\nthat or lose his own standing with the English.\"\n\n\"But how will you escape?\"\n\n\"Nay, that is not the difficulty.  Your husband and Tom Tripe are waiting\nwith the carriage.  My part is easy.  This is the problem:  how will you\nfollow me?\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"I must wear your clothes.  In the dark I shall get past the guard, making\nbelieve that I am you.\"\n\n\"Then how shall I manage?\"\n\n\"You must do as I say.  I can contrive it.  Come, the maids and I will\nmake a true Rajputni of you.  Only I must study how to walk as you do;\nplease walk along in front of me--that way--follow Hasamurti through\nthat door into my room.  I will study how you move your feet and shoulders.\"\n\nLooking back as she followed Hasamurti, Tess witnessed a caricature\nof herself that made her laugh until the tears came.\n\n\"It is well!\" said Yasmini.  \"This night began in hunger, like the young\nmoon.  Now is laughter without malice.  In a few hours will be bright\ndawn--and after that, success!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Eight\n\n\n\n\nAn Elephant Interlude\n\nWatch your step where the elephants sway\nEach at a chain at the end of a day,\nHurrumdi-didddlidi-um-di-ay!\nNothing to do but rock and swing,\nClanking an iron picket ring,\nPlucking the dust to flirt and fling;\nKeep et ceteras out of range,\nAnything out of the way or strange\nSuits us elephant folk for change -\nVarious odds and ends appeal\nTo liven the round of work and meal.\nCurious trunks can reach and steal!\nFool with Two-tails if you dare;\nHelp yourself.  But fool, beware!\nWhatever results is your affair!\nWe are the easiest beasts that be,\nGentle and good and affectionate we,\nYou are the monarchs; we bow the knee,\nBig and obese and obedient--um!\nJust as long as it suits us--um!\nHurrumti-tiddli-di-um-ti-um!\n\n(Unfortunately at this point Akbar's attention was diverted to another\nmatter, so the rest of his picket-song goes unrecorded.)\n\n\n\"They're elephants and I'm a soldier.  The trouble with you is nerves,\nmy boy!\"\n\nThere was brandy in the place that Tom Tripe knew of--brandy and\ntobacco and a smell of elephants.  Dick Blaine, who scarcely ever\ntouched strong liquor, having had intimate acquaintance with abuse\nof it in Western mining camps, had to sit and endure the spectacle\nof Tom's chief weakness, glass after glass of the fiery stuff descending\ninto a stomach long since rendered insatiable by soldiering on peppery\nfood in a climate that is no man's friend.  He protested a dozen times.\n\n\"We may need our wits tonight, Tom.  Suppose we both keep sober.\"\n\n\"Man alive, I've been doing this for years.  Brandy and brains are the\nsame in my case.  Keep me without it, and by bedtime I'm an invalid.\nGive me all I want of it, and I'm a crafty soldier-man.\"\n\nDick Blaine refilled his pipe and watched for an opportunity.  He had\nheard that kind of argument before, and had conquered flood and fire\nwith the aid of the very men who used it, that being the gift (or whatever\nyou like to call it) that had made him independent while the others drew\nmonthly pay in envelopes.\n\nIt was a low oblong shed they sat in, with a wide door opening on a side\nstreet within four hundred yards of Yasmini's palace gate.  It was\nfurnished with a table, two chairs and a cot for Tom Tripe's special\nuse whenever the maharajah's business should happen to keep him\non night duty, his own proper quarters being nearly a mile away.\nAlongside the shed was a very rough stable that would accommodate\na horse or two, and the back wall was a mere partition of mud brick,\nbehind which, under a thatched roof, were tethered some of the maharajah's\nelephants.  There were two windows in the wall, through which one\ncould see dimly the great brutes' rumps as they swayed at their pickets\nrestlessly.  The smell came through a broken pane, and every once in\na while the Blaines' horse, standing ready in the shafts outside with a\nblanket over him, squealed at it indignantly.\n\nTom's horse dozed in the rough shed, being used to elephants.\n\nDick got up once or twice to peer through the window at the brutes.\n\n\"Are they tethered fore and aft?\" he wondered.\n\n\"No,\" Tom answered. \"One hind foot only.\"\n\n\"What's to stop them from turning round and breaking down this rotten wall?\"\n\n\"Nothing--except that they're elephants.  They could break their picket\nchains if they were minded to, same as I could break Gungadhura's\nhead and lose my job.  But I won't do it, and nor will they.  They're\nelephants, and I'm a soldier.  The trouble with you is nerves, my boy.\nHave some brandy.  You're worried about your wife, but I tell you she's\nright as a trivet.  I'd trust my last chance with that little princess.  I've\ndone it often.  Brandy's the stuff to keep your hair on.  Have some.\"\n\nThe bottle had only been three parts full.  Tom poured out the last of\nit and set a stone jorum of rum in readiness on the table over against the wall.\n\n\"Wish we had hot water handy,\" he grumbled.\n\n\"Which of the elephants are tethered here?\" asked Dick.  \"That big\none that killed a tiger in the arena the other day?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Did you see that?  Akbar was scarcely scratched.  Quickest\nthing ever I saw--squealed with rage the minute they turned 'stripes'\nloose--chased him to the wall--downed him with a forefoot and crushed\nhim into tiger jelly before you could say British Constitution!\"\n\n\"I guess that tiger had been kept in a cage too long,\" said Dick.\n\n\"Don't you believe it.  He was fighting fit.  But they'd given old Akbar\na skinfull of rum, and that turns him into a holy terror.  He's quite quiet\nother times.\"\n\nDick looked at his watch.  Tess had been in the palace about three hours,\nand he was confident she would come away as soon as possible, if\nfor no other reason than to put an end to his anxiety.  She was likely\nto appear at the gate at any minute.  At any minute Tom Tripe was likely\nto attack the jorum, and if present symptoms went for anything, it would\nnot take much of it to make him worse than useless.  At present he\nwas growing reminiscent.\n\n\"Once old Akbar had a belly-ache and they gave him arrak.  They didn't\ncatch him for two days!  He pulled up his picket-stake and lit out for\nthe horizon, chasing dogs and hens and monkeys and anything else\nbe could find that annoyed him.  Screamed like a locomotive.  Horrid sight!\"\n\n\"Where does this road outside lead to?\" asked Dick.\n\n\"Don't lead anywhere.  Blind alley.  Why?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing.\"\n\nDick was examining the wall between the shed they sat in and the\nstable-place next door.  It was much stronger than the mud affair between\nthem and the elephants.  Tom Tripe had nearly finished his tumbler-full,\nand there was madness in the air that night that made a man take awfully\nlong chances.\n\n\"Do you suppose a man could lose his way in the dark between here\nand the palace gate?\"\n\n\"Not even if he was as drunk as Noah.  All he'd have to do 'ud be hold\non to the wall and walk forward.  The road turns a corner, but the walls\nare all blind and there's no other way but past the palace.  You sit here,\nthough, my boy.  No need to try that.  Your wife's all right.\"\n\n\"Well, maybe I'd better stay here.\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose I could back the dog-cart into the shed where your\nhorse is?  I hardly like to leave my horse standing any longer in the open,\nyet he's better in the shafts in case we want him in a hurry.\"\n\n\"Yes, the door's wide enough.\"\n\n\"Then I'll do it.\"\n\n\"Suit yourself.  But take some of that rum before you go outside.  The\nnight air's bad for your lungs.  Help yourself and pass the bottle, as\nthe Queen said to the Archbishop of Canterbury.\"\n\n\"All right, I will.\"\n\nDick poured a little on his handkerchief, thrust the handkerchief through\nthe broken pane and waved it violently to spread the smell.  It was\ncheap, immodest stuff, blatant with its own advertisement.  Then he\nset the jorum down on the end of the table farthest from the wall, to\nthe best of his judgment out of reach from the window.\n\n\"Come along, Tom,\" he said then. \"Help me with the horse.\"\n\n\"What's your hurry?  Take a drink first.\"\n\n\"No, let's take one together afterward.\"\n\nHe took Tom by the shoulder and pushed him to his feet.\n\n\"The horse might break away.  Come on, man, hurry!\"\n\nOver his shoulder Dick could see a long trunk nosing its way gingerly\nthrough the broken pane and searching out the source of the alluring\nsmell.  He pushed Tripe along in front of him, and together they backed\nthe dog-cart into the stable-place, making a very clumsy business of\nit for three reasons:  Tom Tripe was none too sober:  the horse was\nnearly crazy with fear of the uncanny brutes just beyond the wall;  and\nDick was in too much hurry for reasons of his own.  However, they got\nhorse and cart in backward, and the door shut before the crash came.\n\nThe crash was of a falling mud-brick wall, pushed outward by the shoulders\nof a pachyderm that wanted alcohol.  The beast had had it out of all\nsorts of containers and knew the trick of emptying the last drop.  The\njorum was about his usual dose.\n\nAbout two minutes later, while Dick and Tom Tripe between them held\na horse in intolerable durance between the shafts, and Tom's horse\nout of sympathy kicked out at random into every shadow he could reach,\nthe door and part of the wall of Tom's shed fell outward into the pitch\ndark street as Akbar, eleven feet four inches at the shoulder, strode\nforward conjecturing what worlds were yet to conquer.  The other elephants\nstood motionless at their pickets.  A terrified mahout emerged through\nthe debris like a devil from bell's bunkers, calling to his elephant all the\nendearing epithets he knew, and cursing him alternately.  The horses\ngrew calmer and submitted to caresses, like children and all creatures\nthat have intimate contact with strong men;  and presently the night grew still.\n\n\"D'you suppose that brute swiped my liquor?\" wondered Tom Tripe.\n        \"You mind the horses while I look.\"\n\nBut suddenly there was a savage noise of trumpeting up-street, followed\nby a bark and a yelp of canine terror.\n\n\"God!\" swore Tom.  \"That's Trotters coming to fetch us!  Akbar's chasing\nhim back this way!  Hang on to the horse like ten men!  I'll go see!\"\n\nHe was outside before Dick could remonstrate.  Between them they\nhad lashed the dog-cart wheels during the first panic, but even so Dick\nhad his hands full, as the trumpeting drew nearer and the horse went\ninto agonies of senseless fear.  It was a fight, nothing less, between\nthinking man and mere instinctive beast, and eventually Dick threw him\nwith a trick of the reins about his legs, and knelt on his head to keep\nhim down.  By the grace of the powers of unexpectedness neither shafts\nnor harness broke.\n\nOutside in the darkness Tom Tripe peered through brandied eyes at\na great shadow that hunted to and fro a hundred yards away, chasing\nsomething that was quite invisible, and making enough noise about it\nto awake the dead.\n\n\"Trotters!\" he yelled. \"Trotters!\"\n\nA moment later a smaller shadow came into view at top speed, panting,\nchased hotly by the bigger one.\n\n\"Trotters!  Get back where you came from!  Back, d'ye hear me!  Back!\"\n\nWithin ten yards of his master the dog stopped to do his thinking, and\nthe elephant screamed with a sort of hunter's ecstasy as he closed\non him with a rush.  But thought is swift, and obedience good judgment.\nThe dog doubled of a sudden between Akbar's legs and the elephant\nslid on his rump in the futile effort to turn after him--then crashed into\nthe wall opposite Tripe's dismantled shed--cannoned off it with a grunt\nof sheer disgust--and set off up-street, once more in hot pursuit.\n\n        \"That brute got my good rum, damn him!\" said Tom, opening\nthe stable door.  \"Hello!  Horse down?  Any harm done?  Right-oh!\nWe'll soon have him up again.  Better hurry now--Trotters came for us.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Nine\n\n\n\n\nSo many look at the color,\nSo many study design,\nSome of 'em squint through a microscope\nTo judge if the texture is fine.\nA few give a thought to the price of the stuff,\nSome feel of the heft in the hand,\nBut once in a while there is one who can smile\nAnd--appraising the lot--understand.\nLook out,\nWhen the seemingly sold understand!\nAll's planned,\nFor the cook of the stew to be canned\nOut o' hand,\nWhen the due to be choused understand!\n\n\n\"It means, the toils are closing in on Gungadhura!\"\n\nWithin the palace Tess was reveling in vaudeville In the first place,\nYasmini had no Western views on modesty.  Whatever her mother\nmay have taught her in that respect had gone the way of all the other\nhandicaps she saw fit to throw into the discard, or to retain for use solely\nwhen she saw there was advantage.  The East uses dress for ornament,\nand understands its use.  The veil is for places where men might look\nwith too bold eyes and covet.  Out of sight of privileged men prudery\nhas no place, and almost no advocates all the way from Peshawar to\nCape Comorin.\n\nAnd Yasmini had loved dancing since the days when she tottered her\nfirst steps for her mother's and Bubru Singh's delight.  Long before\nan American converted the Russian Royal Ballet, and the Russian Royal\nBallet in return took all the theatre-going West by storm--scandalizing,\n then amazing, then educating bit by bit--Yasmini had developed her\nown ideas and brought them by arduous practise to something near\nperfection.  To that her strength, agility and sinuous grace were largely\ndue;  and she practised no deceptions on herself, but valued all three\nqualities for their effect on other people, keeping no light under a bushel.\n\nThe consciousness of that night's climactic quality raised her spirits\nto the point where they were irrepressible, and she danced her garments\noff one by one, using each in turn as a foil for her art until there was\nnothing left with which to multiply rhythm and she danced before the\nlong French mirrors yet more gracefully with nothing on at all.\n\nGetting Tess disrobed was a different matter.  She did not own to much\nprudery, but the maids' eyes were over-curious.  And, lacking, as she\nknew she did, Yasmini's ability to justify nakedness by poetry of motion,\nshe hid behind a curtain and was royally laughed at for her pains.  But\nshe was satisfied to retain that intangible element that is best named\ndignity, and let the laughter pass unchallenged.  Yasmini, with her Eastern\nheritage, could be dignified as well as beautiful as nature made her.\nNot so Tess, or at any rate she thought not, and what one thinks is after\nall the only gage acceptable.\n\nThen came the gorgeous fun of putting on Tess's clothes, each to be\ndanced in as its turn came, and made fun of, so that Tess herself began\nto believe all Western clothes were awkward, idiotic things--until Yasmini\nstood clothed complete at last, with her golden hair all coiled under\na Paris hat, and looked as lovely that way as any.  The two women were\nalmost exactly the same size.  Even the shoes fitted, and when Yasmini\nwalked the length of the room with Tess's very stride and attitude Tess\ngot her first genuine glimpse of herself as another's capably critical\neyes saw her--a priceless experience, and not so humiliating after all.\n\nThey dressed up Tess in man's clothes--a young Rajput's--a suit Yasmini\nhad worn on one of her wild excursions, and what with the coiled turban\nof yellow silk and a little black mustache adjusted by cunning fingers\nshe felt as happy as a child in fancy dress.  But she found it more difficult\nto imitate the Rajput walk than Yasmini did to copy her tricks of carriage.\nFor a few minutes they played at walking together up and down the room\nbefore the mirror, applauded by the giggling maids.  But then suddenly\ncame anti-climax.  There was a great hammering at the outer door, and\none of the maids ran down to investigate, while they waited in breathless silence.\n\nThe news the maid brought back was the worst imaginable.  The look-out\nat the northern corner of the wall (Yasmini kept watch on her captors\nas rigorously as they spied on her) had run with the word to the gateman\nthat Gungadhura himself was coming with three eunuchs, all four on foot.\n\nAlmost as soon as the breathless girl could break that evil tidings there\ncame another hammering, and this time Hasamurti went down to answer.\nHer news was worse.  Gungadhura was at the outer gate demanding\nadmission, and threatening to order the guard to break the gate in if refused.\n\n\"What harm can he do?\" demanded Tess.  \"He won't dare try any violence\nin front of me.  Let us change clothes again.\"\n\nYasmini laughed at her.\n\n\"A prince on a horse may ride from harm,\" she answered.  \"When princes\nwalk, let other folk 'ware trouble!  He comes to have his will on me.\nThose eunuchs are the leash that always hunt with him by night.  They\nwill manhandle you, too, if they once get in, and Gungadhura will take\nhis chance of trouble afterward.  The guard dare not refuse him.\"\n\n\"What shall we do?\" Tess wondered.  \"Can we hide?\"  Then, pulling\nherself together for the sake of her race and her Western womanhood:\n\"If we make noise enough at the gate my husband will come.  We're all right.\"\n\n\"If there are any gods at all,\" said Yasmini piously, \"they will consider\nour plight.  I think this is a vengeance on me because I said I will leave\nmy maids behind.  I will not leave them!  Hasamurti--you and the others\nmake ready for the street!\"\n\nThat was a simple matter.  In three minutes all five women were back\nin the room, veiled from head to foot.  But the hammering at the front\ndoor was repeated, louder than before.  Tess wondered whether to\nhope that the risaldar of the guard had already reported to Gungadhura\nthe lady doctor's visit, or to hope that he had not.\n\n\"We will all go down together now,\" Yasmini decided, and promptly\nshe started to lead the way alone.  But Hasamurti sprang to her side,\nand insisted with tears on disguising herself as her mistress and staying\nbehind to provide one slim chance for the rest to escape.\n\n\"In the dark you will pass for the memsahib,\" she urged.  \"The memsahib\nwill pass for a man.  Wait by the gate until the maharajah enters, while\nI stand at the door under the lamp as a decoy.  I will run into the house,\nand he will follow with the eunuchs, while the rest of you slip out through\nthe gate, and run before the guard can close it.  Perhaps one, at least,\nof the other maids had better stay with me.\"\n\nA second maid volunteered, but Yasmini would have none of that plan.\nFirst and last the great outstanding difference between her and the\nordinary run of conspirators, Western or Eastern, was unwillingness\nto sacrifice faithful friends even in a pinch--although she could be\nruthlessness itself toward half-hearted ones.  Both those habits grew\non her as she grew older.\n\nBy the time they reached the little curtained outer hall the maids were\non the verge of hysteria.  Tess had herself well in control, and was praying\nbusily that her husband might only be near enough to hear the racket\nat the gate.  She was willing to be satisfied with that, and to ask no further\nfavors of Providence, unless that Dick should have Tom Tripe with him.\nOutwardly calm enough, she could not for the life of her remember to\nstride like a man.  Yasmini turned more than once to rally her about it.\n\nYasmini herself looked unaccountably meek in the Western dress, but\nher blue eyes blazed with fury and she walked with confidence, issuing\nher orders in a level voice.  The gateman had come to the door again\nto announce that Gungadhura had issued a final warning.  Two more\nminutes and the outer gate should be burst in by his orders.\n\n\"Tell the maharajah sahib that I come in person to welcome him!\" she\nretorted, and the gateman hurried back into the dark toward his post.\n\nThere were no lights at the outer gate.  One could only guess how the\nstage was set--the maharajah hooded lest some enemy recognize him--\nthe eunuchs behind him with cords concealed under their loose outer\ngarments--and the guard at a respectful distance standing at attention.\nThere was not a maharajah's sepoy in Sialpore who would have dared\nremonstrate with Gungadhura in dark or daylight.\n\nOnly as they passed under the yellow light shed by the solitary lantern\non the iron bracket did Tess get an inkling of Yasmini's plan.  Light glinted\non the wrought hilt of a long Italian dagger, and her smile was cold-\nuncompromising--shuddersome.\n\nTess objected instantly.  \"Didn't you promise you'd kill nobody?  If we'd\na pistol we could fire it in the air and my husband would come in a minute.\"\n\n\"How do we know that Gungadhura hasn't killed your husband, or shut\nhim up somewhere?\"  Yasmini answered, and Tess had an attack of\ncold chills that rendered her speechless for a moment.  She threw it\noff with a prodigious effort.\n\n\"But I've no weapon of any kind, and you can't kill Gungadhura, three\neunuchs and the guard as well!\" she argued presently.\n\n\"Wait and see what I will do!\" was the only answer.  \"Gungadhura caused\nmy pistols to be stolen.  But the darkness is our friend, and I think the\ngods--if there are any gods--are going to assist us.\"\n\nThey walked to the gate in a little close-packed group, and found the\ngateman stuttering through the small square hole provided for interviews\nwith strangers, telling the maharajah for the third or fourth time that the\nprincess herself was coming.  Gungadhura's voice was plainly audible,\ngrowling threats from the outer darkness.\n\n\"Stand aside!\" Yasmini ordered.  \"I will attend to the talking now.\"\n\nShe went close to the square hole, but was careful to keep her face in\nshadow at the left-hand side of it.\n\n\"What can His Highness, Gungadhura Singh, want with his relative at\nthis strange hour?\" she asked.\n\n\"Open the gate!\" came the answer.  He was very close to it--ready to\npush with his shoulder the instant the bolt was drawn, for black passion\nhad him in hand.  But in the darkness he was as invisible as she was.\n\n\"Nay, how shall I know it is Gungadhura Singh?\"\n\n\"Ask the guard!  Ho, there!  Tell her who it is demands admission!\"\n\n\"Nay, they might lie to me!  The voice sounds strange.  I would open\nfor Gungadhura Singh;  but I must be sure it is he and no other.\"\n\n\"Look then!\" he answered, and thrust his dark face close to the opening.\n\nEven the utterly base have intuition.  Nothing else warned him.  In the\nvery nick of time he stepped back, and Yasmini's long dagger that shot\nforward like a stab of lightning only cut the cheek beneath the eye, and\nslit it to the corner of his mouth.\n\nThe blood poured down into his beard and added fury to determination.\n\n\"Guards, break in the gate!\" he shouted, and Yasmini stood back in the\ndarkest shadow, about as dangerous as a cobra guarding young ones.\nWith her left hand she signed to all six women to hide themselves;\nbut Tess came and stood beside her, minded in that minute to give\nGungadhura Western aftermath to reckon with as well as the combined\npresent courage of two women.  Wondering desperately what she\ncould do to help against armed men she suddenly snatched one of\nthe long hat-pins that she herself had adjusted in her own hat on\nYasmini's head.\n\nYasmini hugged her close and kissed her.\n\n\"Better than sister!  Better than friend!\" she whispered.\n\nGungadhura had not been idle while he waited for his message to reach\nYasmini, but had sent some of the guard to find a baulk of timber for\na battering-ram.  The butts of rifles would have been useless against\nthat stout iron.\n\nThe gate shook now under the weight of the first assault, but the guards\nwere handling the timber clumsily, not using their strength together.\nGungadhura cursed them, and spent two valuable minutes trying to\nshow them how the trick should be worked, the blood that poured into\nhis beard, and made of his mouth a sputtering crimson mess, not helping\nto make his raging orders any more intelligible.\n\nPresently the second crash came, stronger and more elastic than the\nfirst.  The iron bent inward, and it was plainly only a matter of minutes\nbefore the bolt would go.  The gateman came creeping to Yasmini's\nside, and, with yellow fangs showing in a grin meant to be affectionate,\ndisplayed an Afghan tulwar.\n\n\"Ismail!\" she said.  \"I thought you were afraid and ran to hide!\"\n\n\"Nay!\" he answered.  \"My life is thine, Princess!  Gungadhura took away\nall weapons, but this I hid.  I went to find it.  See,\" he grinned, feeling\nthe edge with his thumb, \"it is clean!  It is keen!  It will cut throats!\"\n\n\"I will not forget!\" Yasmini answered, but the words were lost in the din\nof the third blow of wood on iron.\n\nThe odds began not to look so bad--two desperate women and a faithful\nNorthern fighting man armed with a weapon that he loved and understood,\nagainst a wounded blackguard and three eunuchs.  Perhaps the guard\nmight look on and not interfere.  There was a chance to make a battle\nroyal of it, whose tumult would bring Dick Blaine and Tom Tripe to the\nrescue.  What was the dog doing?  Tess wondered whether any animal\ncould be so intelligent after all as Tom pretended his was.  Perhaps\nthe maharajah had seen the dog and killed him.\n\n\"Listen!\" she urged.  \"Tell your maids to stampede for the street the\ninstant the door breaks in.  That will give the guard their work to do to\nhold them.  Meanwhile--\"\n\n\"Thump!\" came the timber on the gate again, and even the hinges shook\nin their stone setting.\n\n\"Listen!\" said Yasmini.\n\nThere was another noise up-street--a rushing to and fro, and a trumpeting\nthat no one could mistake.\n\n\"I said that--\"\n\n\"Thump!\" came the baulk of timber--not so powerfully as before.  There\nwas distraction affecting the team-work.  The scream of an elephant\nfighting mad, and the yelp of a dog, that pierces every other noise, rent\nthe darkness close at hand.\n\n\"I said that the gods--\"\n\nThere came the thud of a very heavy body colliding with a wall, and\nanother blood-curdling scream of rage--then the thunder of what might\nhave been an avalanche as part of a near-by wall collapsed, and a brute\nas big as Leviathan approached at top speed.\n\nThere was another thud, but this time caused by the hulk of timber falling\non the ground, as guard, eunuchs and Gungadhura all took to their heels.\n\n\"Allah!  Il hamdul illah!\" swore the gateman.  (Thanks be to God!)\n\n\"I said that the gods would help tonight!\" Yasmini cried exultantly.\n\n\"O Lord, what has happened to Dick?\" groaned Tess between set teeth.\n\nThe thunder of pursuit drew nearer.  Possessed by some instinct she\nnever offered to explain, Yasmini stepped to the gate, drew back the\nbolt, and opened it a matter of inches.  In shot Tom Tripe's dog, with\nhis tongue hanging out and the fear of devils blazing in his eyes.  Yasmini\nslammed the gate again in the very face of a raging elephant, and shot\nthe bolt in the nick of time to take the shock of his impact.\n\nIt was only a charge in half-earnest or he would have brought the gate\ndown.  An elephant is a very short-sighted beast, and it was pitch-dark.\nHe could not believe that a dog could disappear through a solid iron\ngate, and after testing the obstruction for a moment or two, grumbling\nto himself angrily, he stood to smell the air and listen.  There was a\nnoise farther along the street of a stampede of some kind.  That was\nlikely enough his quarry, probably frightening other undesirables along\nin front of him.  With a scream of mingled frenzy and delight he went\noff at once full pelt.\n\n\"Oh, Trotters!  Good dog, Trotters!\" sobbed Tess, kneeling down to\nmake much of him, and giving way to the reaction that overcomes men\nas well as women.  \"Where's your master?  Oh, if you could tell me\nwhere my husband is!\"\n\nShe did not have long to wait for the answer to that.  It took the two men\na matter of seconds to get the horse on his feet, and no fire-engine\never left the station house one fraction faster than Dick tooled that dog-cart.\nThe horse was all nerves and in no mood to wait on ceremony, which\naccounted for a broken spoke and a fragment of the gate-post hanging\nin the near wheel.  They forgot to unlash the wheels before they started,\nso the dog-cart came up-street on skids, as it were, screaming holy\nmurder on the granite flags--which in turn saved the near wheel from\ndestruction.  It also made it possible to rein in the terrified horse exactly\nin front of the palace gate;  another proof that as Yasmini said, the gods\nof India were in a mood to help that night.  (Not that she ever believed\nthe gods are one bit more consequential than men.)\n\nYasmini drew the bolt, and the gate creaked open reluctantly;  the shock\nof the elephant's shoulder had about ended its present stage of usefulness.\nTom Tripe, dismounting from his horse in a hurry and throwing the reins\nover the dog-cart lamp, was first to step through.\n\n\"Where's my dog?\" he demanded.  \"Where's that Trotters o' mine?\nDid Akbar get him?\"\n\nA cold nose thrust in his hand was the answer.\n\n\"Oh, so there you are, you rascal!  There--lie down!\"\n\nThat was all the ceremonial that passed between them, but the dog\nseemed satisfied.\n\nTess was out through the gate almost sooner than Tom Tripe could\nenter it.  They brushed each other's shoulders as they passed.  Up in\nthe dog-cart she and her husband laughed in each other's arms, each\nat the other's disguise, neither of them with the slightest notion what\nwould happen next, except that Dick knew the dog-cart wheels would\nhave to be unlashed.\n\n\"How many people will the carriage hold?\"  Yasmini called to them,\nappearing suddenly in the lamp-light.  And Dick Blaine began laughing\nall over again, for except for the golden hair she looked so like the wife\nwho sat on his left hand, and his wife so like a Rajput that the humor\nof the situation was its only obvious feature.\n\n\"I must not take my carriage, for they would trace it, and besides, there\nis too little time.  Can we all ride in your carriage?  There are six of us.\"\n\n\"Probably.  But where to?\" Dick answered.\n\n\"I will direct.  Ismail must come too, but he can run.\"\n\nIt was an awful crowd, for the dog-cart was built for four people at the\nmost, and in the end Tess insisted on riding behind Tom Tripe because\nshe was dressed like a man and could do it easily.  Ismail was sent\nback to close the gate from the inside and clamber out over the top\nof it.  There was just room for a lean and agile man to squeeze between\nthe iron and the stone arch.\n\n\"Let the watchmen who feared and hid themselves stay to give their\nown account to Gungadhura!\" Yasmini sneered scornfully.  \"They are\nno longer men of mine!\"\n\n\"Now, where away?\" demanded Dick, giving the horse his head.  \"To\nmy house?  You'll be safe there for the present.\"\n\n\"No.  They might trace us there.\"\n\nYasmini was up beside him, wedged tightly between him and Hasamurti,\nso like his own wife, except for a vague Eastern scent she used, that\nhe could not for the life of him speak to her as a stranger.\n\n\"Listen!\" she said excitedly.  \"I had horses here, there, everywhere in\ncase of need.  But Gungadhura sent men and took them all.  Now I\nhave only one horse--in your stable--I must get that tonight.  First, then,\ndrive my women to a place that I will show you.\"\n\nAway in the distance they could hear the trumpeting of Akbar, and the\nshouts of men who had been turned out to attempt the hopeless task\nof capturing the brute.  At each scream the horse trembled in the shafts\nand had to be managed skillfully, but the load was too heavy now for\nhim to run away with it.\n\n\"If that elephant will continue to be our friend and will only run the other\nway for a distraction, so that we are not seen, one of these days I will\ngive him a golden howdah!\" vowed Yasmini.\n\nAnd Akbar did that very thing.  Whoever was awake that night in Sialpore,\nand was daring enough to venture in the dark streets, followed the line\nof destruction and excitement, gloating over the broken property of\nenemies or awakening friends to make them miserable with condolences.\nThe dog-cart threaded through the streets unseen, for even the scarce\nnight-watchmen left their posts to take part in the hunt.\n\nYasmini guided them to the outskirts of the town in a line as nearly straight\nas the congenital deviousness of Sialpore's ancient architects allowed.\nThere was not a street but turned a dozen times to the mile.  At one\npoint she bade Dick stop, and begged Tess to let Tom Tripe take her\nhome, promising to see her again within the hour.  But Tess had recovered\nher nerve and was determined to see the adventure through, in spite\nof the discomforts of a seat behind Tom's military saddle.\n\nThey brought up at last in front of a low dark house at the very edge\nof the city.  It stood by itself in a compound, with fields behind it, and\nlooked prosperous enough to belong to one of the maharajah's suite.\n\n\"The house of Mukhum Dass!\" Yasmini announced.\n\n\"The money-lender?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nDick made a wry face, for the man's extortions were notorious.  But\nYasmini never paused to cast up virtue when she needed assistants\nin a hurry;  rather she was adept at appraising character and bending\nit to suit her ends.  Ismail, hot and out of breath from running at the cart-tail,\nwas sent to pound the money-lender's door, until that frightened individual\ncame down himself to inquire (with the door well held by a short chain)\nwhat the matter was.\n\n\"I lend no money in the night!\" was his form of greeting.  He always\nused it when gamblers came to him in the heat of the loser's passion\nat unearthly hours--and sometimes ended by making a loan at very\nhigh interest on sound security.  Otherwise he would have stayed in\nbed, whatever the thunderous importunity.\n\nYasmini was down at the door by that time, and it was she who answered.\n\n\"Nay, but men win lawsuits by gathering evidence!  Are title-deeds not\nlegal in the dark?\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" he demanded, reaching backward for a little lamp that\nhung on the wall behind him and trying to see her face.\n\n\"I am the same who met you that morning on the hilltop and purchased\nsilence from you at a price.\"\n\nHe peered through the narrow opening, holding the lamp above his head.\n\n\"That was a man.  You are a woman.\"\n\nFor answer to that she stood on tiptoe and blew the lamp out.  He would\nhave slammed the door, but her foot was in the way.\n\n\"By dark or daylight, Mukhum Dass, your eyes read nothing but the\nnames on hundis (notes)!  Now, what does the car say?  Does the voice\ntell nothing?\"\n\n\"Aye, it is the same.\"\n\n\"You shall have that title-deed tomorrow at dawn--on certain terms.\"\n\n\"How do I know?'\n\n\"Because I say it--I, who said that Chamu would repay his son's loan,--\nI, who knew from the first all about the title-deed,--I, who know where\nit is this minute,--I, who know the secrets of Jinendra's priest,--I, whose\nname stands written on the hundred-rupee note with which the butler\npaid his son's debt!\"\n\n\"The princess!  The Princess Yasmini!  It was her name on the note!\"\n\n\"Her name is mine!\"\n\nThe money-lender stood irresolutely, shifting his balance from foot\nto foot.  It was his experience that when people with high-born names\ncame to him by night mysteriously there was always profit in it for himself.\nAnd then, there was that title-deed.  He had bought the house cheap,\nbut its present value was five times what he gave for it.  Its loss would\nmean more to him than the loss of a wife to some men--as Yasmini\nknew, and counted on.\n\n\"Open the door and let me in, Mukhum Dass!  The terms are these--\"\n\n\"Nay, we can talk with the door between us.\"\n\n\"Very well, then, lose thy title-deed!  Dhulap Singh, thine enemy, shall\nhave it within the hour!\"\n\nShe took her foot out from the door and turned away briskly.  Promptly\nhe opened the door wide, and called after her.\n\n\"Nay, come, we will discuss it.\"\n\n\"I discuss nothing!\" she answered with a laugh.  \"I dictate terms!\"\n\n\"Name them, then.\"\n\n\"I have here five women.  They must stay in safety in your house until\nan hour before dawn.\"\n\n\"God forbid!\"\n\n\"Until an hour before dawn, you hear me?  If any come to inquire for\nthem or me, you must deny any knowledge.\"\n\n\"That I would be sure enough to do!  Shall I have it said that Mukhum\nDass keeps a dozen women in his dotage?\"\n\n\"An hour before dawn I will come for them.\"\n\n\"None too soon!\"\n\n\"Then I will write a letter to a certain man, who, on presentation of the\nletter, will hand you the title-deed at once without payment.\"\n\n\"A likely tale!\"\n\n\"Was it a likely tale that Chamu would repay his son's debt?\"\n\n\"Well--I will take the hazard.  Bring them in.  But I will not feed them.\nAnd if you fail to come for them before dawn I will turn them out and\nit shall be all over Sialpore that the Princess Yasmini--\"\n\n\"One moment, Mukhum Dass!  If one word of this escapes your lips\nfor a month to come, you shall go to jail for receiving stolen money in\npayment of a debt!  My name was on the money that Chamu paid you with.\nYou knew he stole it.\"\n\n\"I did not know!\"\n\n\"Prove that in court, then!\"\n\n\"Bring the women in!\" he grumbled.  \"I am no cackler from the roofs!\"\n\nYasmini did not wait for him to change his mind but shepherded her\nscared dependents through the door, and called for Ismail.\n\n\"Did you see these women enter?\" she demanded.\n\n\"Aye.  I saw.  Have I not eyes?\"\n\n\"Stay thou here outside and watch.  Afterward, remember, if I say nothing,\nbe thou dumb as Tom Tripe's dog.  But if I give the word, tell all Sialpore\nthat Mukhum Dass is a satyr who holds revels in his house by night.\nBring ten other men to swear to it with thee, until the very children of\nthe streets shout it after him when he rides his rounds!  Hast thou\nunderstood?  Silence for silence!  But talk for talk!  Hast thou heard,\ntoo, Mukhum Dass?  Good!  Shut thy door tight, but thy mouth yet tighter!\nAnd try rather to take liberties with hornets than with those five women!\"\n\nBefore he could answer she was gone, leaving Ismail lurking in the\nshadows.  Tess had dismounted from behind Tom Tripe and climbed\nup beside her husband so that there were three on the front seat again.\n\n\"Now, Tom Tripe!\" Yasmini ordered, speaking with the voice of command\nthat Tom himself would have used to a subordinate.  \"Do you as the\nelephant did, and cause distraction.  Draw Gungadhura off the scent!\"\n\n\"Hell's bells, deary me, Your Ladyship!\" he answered.  \"All the drawing\nI'll do after this night's work will be my last month's pay, and lucky if I\nsee that!  Lordy knows what the guard'll tell the maharajah, nor what\nhis rage'll add to it!\"\n\n\"Nonsense!  Gungadhura and the guard ran from the elephant like dust\nbefore the wind.  The guards are the better men, and will be back at\ntheir post before this;  but Gungadhura must find a discreet physician\nto bind a slit face for him!  Visit the guard now, and get their ear first.\nTell them Gungadhura wants no talk about tonight's work.  Then come\nto Blaine sahib's house and search the cellar by lamplight, letting Chalmu\nthe butler see you do it, but taking care not to let him see what you see.\nWhat you do see, leave where it lies!  Then see Gungadhura early in\nthe morning--\"\n\n\"Lordy me, Your Ladyship, he'll--\"\n\n\"No, he won't.  He'll want to know how much you know about his behavior\nat the gate.  Tell him you know everything, and that you've compelled\nthe guard to keep silence.  That ought to reconcile the coward!  But if\nhe threatens you, then threaten him!  Threaten to go to Samson sahib\nwith the whole story.  (But if you do dare really go to Samson sahib,\nnever look me in the face again!)  Then tell Gungadhura that you searched\nthe cellar, and what you saw there under a stone, adding that Blaine\nsahib was suspicious, and watched you, and afterward sealed the\ncellar door.  Have you understood me?\"\n\n\"I understand there's precious little sleep for me tonight, and hell in\nthe morning!\"\n\n\"Pouf!  Are you a soldier?\"\n\n\"I'm your ladyship's most thorough-paced admirer and obedient slave!\"\nTom answered gallantly, his mutton-chop whiskers fairly bristling with a grin.\n\n\"Prove it, then, this night!\"\n\n\"As if I hadn't!  Well--all's well, Your Ladyship, I'm on the job!  Crib,\ncrupper and breakfast-time, yours truly!\"\n\n\"When you have finished interviewing Gungadhura, find for Blaine sahib\na new cook and a new butler, who can be trusted not to poison him!\"\n\n\"If I can!\"\n\n\"Of course you can find them!  Tell Sita Ram, Samson sahib's babu,\nwhat is wanted.  He will find men in one hour who have too much honor,\nand too little brains, and too great fear to poison any one!  Say that I\nrequire it of him.  Have your understood?  Then go!  Go swiftly to the\nguard and stop their tongues!\"\n\nTom whistled his dog and rode off at a canter.  Dick gave the horse\nhis head and drove home as fast as the steepness of the hill permitted,\nYasmini talking to him nearly all the way.\n\n\"You must dismiss Chamu,\" she insisted.  \"He is Gungadhura's man,\nand the cook is under the heel of Chamu.  Either man would poison his\nown mother for a day's pay!  Send them both about their business the\nfirst thing in the morning if you value your life!  Before they go, let them\nsee you put a great lock on the cellar door, and nail it as well, and put\nweights on it!  If men come at any time to pry about the house, ask\nSamson sahib for a special policeman to guard the place!\"\n\n\"But what is all this leading to?\" demanded Dick.  \"What does it mean?\"\n\n\"It means,\" she said slowly, \"that the toils are closing in on Gungadhura!\"\n\n\"The way I figure it,\" he answered, \"some one else had a pretty narrow\nshave tonight!\"\n\nYasmini knew better than to threaten Dick, or even to argue with him\nvehemently, much less give him orders.  But each man has a line of\nleast resistance.\n\n\"Your wife has told you what Gungadhura attempted?\" she asked him.\n\n\"Yes, while you were at the money-lender's--something of it.\"\n\n\"If the guard should tell Gungadhura that your wife was in the palace\nwith me and could give evidence against him, what do you suppose\nGungadhura would do?\"\n\n\"Damn him!\" Dick murmured.\n\n\"There are so many ways--snakes--poison--daggers in the dark--\"\n\n\"What do you suggest?\" he asked her.  \"Leave Sialpore?\"\n\n\"Yes, but with me!  I know a safe place.  She should come with me.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"Tonight!  Before dawn.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"By camel.  I had horses and Gungadhura took them all, but his brain\nwas too sotted to think of camels, and I have camels waiting not many\nmiles from here!  I shall take my horse from your stable and ride for\nthe camels, bringing them to the house of Mukhum Dass.  Let your\nwife meet me there one hour before dawn.\"\n\n\"Dick!\" said Tess, with her arm around him.  \"I want to go!  I know it\nsounds crazy, and absurd, and desperate;  but I'm sure it isn't!  I want\nyou to let me go with her.\"\n\nThey reached the house before he answered, he, turning it over and\nover in his mind, taking into reckoning a thousand things.\n\n\"Well,\" he said at last, \"once in a while there's the strength of a man\nabout you, Tess.  Maybe I'm a lunatic, but have it your own way, girl,\nhave it your own way!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Ten\n\n\n\n\nIn odor of sweet sanctity I bloom,\nWith surplus of beatitude I bless,\nI'm the confidant of Destiny and Doom,\nI'm the apogee of knowledge more or less.\nIf I lie, it is to temporize with lying\nLest obliquity should suffer in the light.\nIf I prey upon the widow and the dying,\nThey withheld;  and I compel them to do right.\nI am justified in all that I endeavor,\nIf I fail it is because the rest are fools.\nI'm serene and unimpeachable forever,\nThe upheld, ordained interpreter of rules.\n\n\n\"Discretion is better part of secrecy!\"\n\nSome of what follows presently was told to Yasmini afterward by Sita Ram,\nsome of it by Tom Tripe, and a little by Dick Blaine, who had it from\nSamson himself.  The rest she pieced together from admissions by\nJinendra's fat priest and the gossip of some dancing girls.\n\nSir Roland Samson, K. C. S. I., as told already, was a very demon for\nswift office work, routine pouring off him into the hands of the right\nsubordinates like water into the runnels of a roof, leaving him free to\nbask in the sunshine of self-complacency.  But there is work that can\nnot be tackled, or even touched by subordinates;  and, the fixed belief\nof envious inferiors to the contrary notwithstanding, there are hours\nunpaid for, unincluded in the office schedule, and wholly unadvertised\nthat hold such people as commissioners in durance vile.\n\nOn the night of Yasmini's escape Samson sat sweating in his private\nroom, with moths of a hundred species irritating him by noisy self-\nimmolation against the oil lamp-whose smoke made matters worse\nby being sucked up at odd moments by the punkah, pulled jerkily by\na new man.  Most aggravating circumstance of all, perhaps, was that\nthe movement of the punkah flickered his papers away whenever he\nremoved a weight.  Yet he could not study them unless he spread\nthem all in front of him;  and without the punkah he felt he would die\nof apoplexy.  He had to reach a decision before midnight.\n\nBabu Sita Ram was supposed to be sitting tinder a punkah in the next\nroom, with a locked door between him and his master.  He was staying\nlate, by special request and as a special favor, to copy certain very\nimportant but not too secret documents in time for the courier next day.\nThere were just as many insects to annoy him, and the punkah flapped\nhis papers too;  but fat though he was, and sweat though he did, his\nsmile was the smile of a hunter.  From time to time he paused from\ncopying, stole silently to the door between the offices, gingerly removed\na loose knot from a panel, and clapped to the hole first one, and then\nthe other avidious brown eye.\n\nSamson wished to goodness there was some one he dared consult with.\nThere were other Englishmen, of course, but they were all ambitious\nlike himself.  He felt that his prospects were at stake.  News had reached\nthe State Department (by channels Sita Ram could have uncovered\nfor him) that Gungadhura was intriguing with tribes beyond the northwest frontier.\n\nThe tribes were too far away to come in actual touch with Sialpore,\nalthough they were probably too wild and childish to appreciate that fact.\nThe point was that Gungadhura was said to be promising them armed\nassistance from the British rear--assistance that he never would possibly\nbe able to render them;  and his almost certain intention was, when\nthe rising should materialize, to offer his small forces to the British\nas an inexpensive means of quelling the disturbance, thus restoring\nhis own lost credit and double-crossing all concerned.  A subtle motive,\nsubtly suspected.\n\nIt was no new thing in the annals of Indian state affairs, nor anything\nto get afraid about;  but what the State Department desired to know\nwas, why Sir Roland Samson, K. C. S. I., was not keeping a closer\neye on Gungadhura, what did he propose as the least troublesome\nand quietest solution, and would he kindly answer by return.\n\nAll that was bad enough, because a \"beau ideal commissioner\" rather\nnaturally feels distressed when information of that sort goes over his\nhead or under his feet to official superiors.  But he could have got\naround it.  It should not have been very difficult to write a report that\nwould clear himself and give him time to turn around.\n\nBut that very evening no less an individual than the high priest of Jinendra\nhad sent word by Sita Ram that he craved the favor of an interview.\n\n\"And,\" had added Sita Ram with malicious delight, \"it is about the treasure\nof Sialpore and certain claims to it that I think he wants to see you.\"\n\n\"Why should he come by night?\" demanded Samson.\n\n\"Because his errand is a secret one,\" announced the babu, with a hand\non his stomach as if he had swallowed something exquisite.\n\nSo Samson was in a quandary, going over secret records getting ready\nfor an issue with the priest.  His report had to be ready by morning, yet\nhe hardly dared begin it without knowing what the priest might have in\nmind;  and on his own intricate knowledge of the situation might depend\nwhether or not he could extract, from a man more subtle than himself,\ninformation on which to base sound proposals to his government.  His\nreputation was decidedly at stake;  and dangerous intrigue was in the\nair, or else the priest would never be coming to visit him.\n\nSita Ram kept peeping at him through the knot-hole, as a cook peers\nat a tit-bit in the oven, to judge whether it is properly cooked yet.\n\nJinendra's priest had had time for reflection.  True to his kidney, he\ntrusted nobody, unlike Yasmini who knew whom to trust, and when,\nand just how far.  It was all over the city that Gungadhura's practises\nwere hastening his ruin, so it was obviously wise not to espouse the\nmaharajah's cause, in addition to which he had become convinced in\nhis own mind that Yasmini actually knew the whereabouts of the Sialpore\ntreasure.  But he did not trust Yasmini either, nor did he relish her\nscornful promise of a mere percentage of the hoard when it should\nat last be found.  He wanted at least the half of it, bargains to the contrary\nnotwithstanding;  and he had that comfortable conscience that has\nsoothed so many priests, that argues how the church must be above\nall bargains, all bonds, all promises.  Was there any circumstance,\nor man, or woman who could bind and circumscribe Jinendra's high\npriest?  He laughed at the suggestion of it.  Samson was the man to see--\nSamson the man to be inveigled in the nets.  So he sent his verbal\nmessage by the mouth of Sita Ram--a very pious devotee of Jinendra\nby Yasmini's special orders;  and, disguising his enormous bulk in a\nthin cloak, set forth long after dark in a covered cart drawn by two tiny bulls.\n\nThere were two doors to Sita Ram's small office;  two to Samson's\nlarge one--three doors in all, because they shared the connecting one\n(that was locked just now) in common.  At the first sound of the long-\nawaited heavy footsteps on the outer porch Sita Ram hurried to do the\nhonors, and presently ushered into Samson's presence the enormous\nbulk of the high priest, spreading a clean cloth for him on an easy chair\nbecause the priest's caste put it out of the question for him to sit on\nleather defiled by European trousers.\n\nThen, while the customary salaams were taking place, and the customary\nquestions about health and other matters that neither cared a fig about,\nSita Ram ostentatiously drew a curtain part-way over the connecting\ndoor, and retired by way of the other door and the passage to remove\nthe knot from its hole.\n\nIt was part of Samson's pride, and one of his stoutest rungs in the ladder\nof preferment, that be knew more Indian languages than any other man\nof his rank in the service, and knew them well.  There were asterisks\nand stars and twiggly marks against his name in the blue book that\nwould have passed muster as a secret code, and every one of them\nbetokened passed examinations in some Eastern tongue.  So he was\nfully able to meet the high priest on his own ground, as well as conscious\nof the advantage he held to begin with, in that the priest had come to\nhim instead of his going to the priest.\n\n\"Well?\" he demanded, cutting the pleasantries short abruptly as soon\nas Sita Ram had closed the door.\n\n\"I came to speak of politics.\"\n\n\"I listen.\"\n\nSamson leaned back and scrutinized his visitor with deliberate rudeness.\nHaving the upper hand he proposed to hold it.\n\nBut Jinendra's high priest was no beginner either in the game of\nBeggar-my-neighbor.  He understood the value of a big trump to begin\nwith, provided there is other ammunition in reserve.\n\n\"The whereabouts of the treasure of Sialpore is known!\"\n\n\"The deuce it is!\" said Samson, in good plain English.  \"Who knows it?\"\nhe demanded.\n\nThe high priest smiled.\n\nSamson, as was natural, felt that tingling up and down the spine and\nquickening of the heart-beats that announces crisis in one's personal\naffairs, but concealed it admirably.  It was the high priest's turn to speak.\nHe waited.\n\n\"Half of that treasure belongs to the priesthood of Jinendra,\" said the\npriest at last.\n\n\"Since when?\"\n\n\"Since the beginning.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"We were keepers of the treasure once years ago, before the English came.\nThere came a time when the reigning rajah deceived us by a trick,\nincluding murder;  and ever since the English took control the priests\nhave had less and less authority.  There has been no chance to--\nto bring any--to put pressure--to reestablish our rights.  Nevertheless,\nour rights in the matter were never surrendered.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that exactly?\"\n\n\"The English are now the real rulers of Sialpore.\"\n\nSamson nodded.  That was a significant admission, coming from a\nBrahman priest.\n\n\"They should claim the treasure.  But they can not claim it without knowing\nwhere it is.  The priests of Jinendra are entitled to their half.\"\n\n\"You mean you are willing that my government should take half the treasure,\nprovided the priests of Jinendra get the other half of it?\"\n\nThe priest moved his head and his lips in a way that might be taken\nto mean anything.\n\n\"If you know where the treasure is, dig it up,\" said Samson, \"and you\nshall have your answer!\"\n\nYasmini in the heat of excitement had called Samson an idiot, but he\nwas far from being that, as she knew as well as any one.  He judged\nin that moment that if Jinendra's priest knew really where the treasure\nwas, he would never have come to drive a bargain for the half of it,\nbut would have taken all and said nothing.  On the other hand, it well\nmight be that Gungadhura's searchers had stumbled on it.  In that\ncase, there was that secret letter from headquarters hurriedly placed\nin his top drawer when the priest came in, that would give good excuse\nfor putting screws on Gungadhura.  A coup d'etat was not beyond the\npale of possibility.  As a champion of indiscretion and a judge of\ncircumstances, he would dare.  The gleam in his eyes betrayed that\nhe would dare, and the priest grew uneasy.\n\n\"It is not I who know where the treasure is.  I know who knows.\"\n\n\"You mean Gungadhura knows!\"\n\nThe priest smiled again.  The commissioner was not such a dangerous\nantagonist after all.  Samson's eyes betrayed disappointment, and\nthe priest took heart of grace.\n\n\"For one-half of the treasure I will tell you who it is that knows.  You\ncan take possession of the of the person.  Then--\"\n\n\"Illegal.  By what right could I arrest a person simply because some\none else asserts without proof that that person knows where the treasure is?\"\n\n\"Not arrest, perhaps.  But you might protect.\"\n\n\"From whom?  From what?\"\n\n\"Gungadhura suspects.  He might use poison--torture--might carry the\nperson off into hiding--\"\n\nHe paused, for Samson's eyes were again a signal of excitement.\nHe had it!  He knew as much as the priest himself did in that instant!\nThere was one particular individual in Sialpore who fitted that bill.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" he answered.  \"Gungadhura would be answerable to\nme for any outrages.\"\n\nThe priest showed a slight trace of dejection, but went forward bravely\nto defeat.\n\n\"There is danger,\" he said.  \"If Gungadhura should lay hands on all\nthat money, there would be no peace in Rajputana.  I should not bargain\naway what belongs to the priesthood, but discretion is permitted me;\nif you will agree with me tonight, I will accept a little less than half of it.\"\n\nSamson wanted time to think, and he was through with the priest--finished\nwith the interview,--not even anxious to appear polite.\n\n\"If you bring me definite information,\" he said slowly, \"and on the strength\nof that my government should come in possession of the Sialpore\ntreasure, I will promise you in writing five per cent. of it for the funds\nof the priesthood of Jinendra, the money to be held in trust and administered\nsubject to accounting.\"\n\nJinendra's high priest hove his bulk out of the leather chair and went\nthrough the form of taking leave, contenting himself, too, with the veriest\nshell of courtesy--scorn for such an offer scowling from his fat face.\nSamson showed him to the door and closed it after him, leaving\nBabu Sita Ram to do the honors outside in the passage.\n\n\"I kiss feet!\" said the babu.  \"You must bless me, father.  I kiss feet!\"\n\nThe priest blessed him perfunctorily.\n\n\"Is there anything I can do, holy one?  Anything a babu such as I can\ndo to earn merit?\"\n\nRolling on his ponderous way toward the waiting bull-cart, the priest\npaused a moment--eyed Sita Ram as a python eyes a meal--and answered him.\n\n\"Tell that woman from me that if she has a plan at all she must unfold\nit swiftly.  Tell her that this Samson sahib is after the treasure for himself;\nthat he invited me to help him and to share it with him.  Let her have\nword with me swiftly.\"\n\n\"What treasure?\" asked Sita Ram ingenuously.  Having had his ear\nto the knot-hole throughout the interview, it suited him to establish innocence.\nThe priest could have struck himself for the mistake, and Sita Ram,\ntoo, for the impudence.\n\n\"Never mind!\" he answered.  \"Tell her what I say.  Those who obey\nand ask no unwise questions oftentimes receive rewards.\"\n\nInside the office Samson sat elated, wiping his forehead and setting\nblotter over writing-paper lest sweat from his wrists make the ink run.\nIt was a bender of a night, but he saw his way to a brilliant stroke of\nstatecraft that would land him on the heights of official approval forever.\nHeat did not matter.  The man at the punkah had fallen asleep, but he\ndid not bother to waken him.  Back at the knot-hole, babu Sita Ram\nwatched him scribble half a dozen letters, tearing each up in turn until\nthe last one pleased him.  Finally he sealed a letter, and directed it by\nsimply writing two small letters--r. s.--in the bottom left-hand corner.\n\n\"Sita Ram!\" he shouted then.\n\nThe babu let him call three times, for evidence of how hard it was to\nhear through that thick door.  When he came it was round by the other\nway in a hurry.\n\n\"You called, sir?\"\n\n\"You need not copy any more of those documents tonight, Sita Ram.\nI shall send a telegram in the morning and keep my report in hand for\na day or two.  But there's one more little favor I would like to ask of you.\"\n\n\"Anything, sahib!  Anything!  Am only desirous to please your excellency.\"\n\n\"Do you know a man named Tripe--Tom Tripe--drill-instructor to the\nMaharajah's Guard?\"\n\n\"Yes, sahib.\"\n\n\"Could you find him, do you think?\"\n\n\"Tonight, sahib?\"\n\n\"Yes, tonight.\"\n\n\"Sahib, he is usually drunk at night, and very rough!  Nevertheless, I\ncould find him.\"\n\n\"Please do.  And give him this letter.  Say it is from me.  He will know\nwhat to do with it.  Oh, and Sita Ram--\"\n\n\"Yes, sahib.\"\n\n\"You will receive two days' extra pay from me, over and above your\nsalary, for tonight's extra work.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sahib.  You are most kind--always most generous.\"\n\n\"And--ah--Sita Ram--\"\n\n\"Sahib?\"\n\n\"Say nothing, will you?  By nothing I mean nothing!  Hold your tongue, eh?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sahib.  Aware of the honor of my confidential position, I am\nalways most discreet!\"\n\n\"What are you doing with that waste-basket?\"\n\n\"Taking it outside, sahib.\"\n\n\"The sweeper will do that in the morning.\"\n\n\"Am always discreet, sahib.  Discretion is better part of secrecy!  Better\nto burn all torn-up paper before daylight always!\"\n\n\"Very good.  You're quite right.  Thank you, Sita Ram.  Yes, burn the\ntorn paper, please.\"\n\nSo Sita Ram, piecing together little bits of paper got a very good idea\nof what was in the letter that he carried.  The bonfire in the road looked\nbeautiful and gladdened his esthetic soul, but the secret information\nthrilled him, which was better.  He crossed the river, and very late that\nnight he found Tom Tripe, as sober as a judge, what with riding back\nand forth to the Blaines' house and searching in a cellar and what-not.\nHe gave him the letter, and received a rupee because Tom's dog\nfrightened him nearly out of his wits.  Tom swore at the letter fervently,\nbut that was Tom's affair, who could not guess the contents.\n\nAlmost exactly at dawn Sita Ram, as sleepy as a homing owl, reached\nhis own small quarters in the densest part of town.  He had his hand\non the door when another hand restrained him from behind.\n\n\"You know me?\" said a voice he did not know.  A moment later his\nterrified eyes informed him.\n\n\"Mukhum Dass?  I owe you nothing!\"\n\n\"Liar!  You have my title-deed!  Hand it over before I bring the constabeel!\"\n\n\"I?  Your title-deed?  I know nothing of it.  What title-deed?\"\n\nMukhum Dass cut expostulation short, and denied himself the pleasure\nof further threatening.\n\n\"See.  Here is a letter.  Read it, and then hand me over my title-deed!\"\n\n\"Ah!  That is different?\" said Sita Ram, pocketing Yasmini's letter, for\nprecaution's sake.  \"Wait here while I bring it!\"\n\nTwo minutes later he returned with a parchment in a tin tube.\n\n\"Do I receive no recompense?\" he asked.  \"Did I not find the title-deed\nand keep it safe?  Where is the reward?\"\n\n\"Recompense?\" growled Mukhum Dass.  \"To be out of jail is recompense!\nThe next time you find property of mine, bring it to me, or the constabeel\nshall have work to do!\"\n\n\"Dog!\" snarled the babu after him.  \"Dog of a usurer!  Wait and see!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Eleven\n\n\n\n\nTo cover a trail is less than half the work, for any dog with a nose\ncan smell it out.  You should make a false trail afterward to deceive\nthe clever folk.  -Eastern Proverb\n\n\"Say: that little girl you're wanting to run off with is my wife!\"\n\nThe other side to the intrigue developed furiously up at the Baines'\nhouse on the hillside.  Yasmini gave directions from Tess's bedroom,\nwhere Tess hid her from prying servants, she electing to change clothes\nonce more--this time into her hostess' riding breeches, boots and helmet.\nBut she insisted on Tess retaining the Rajput costume, only allowing\na hand-bag to be packed with woman's things, skirt, blouse and so on.\n\n\"If I am seen there must be no mistake about me.  They must swear\nthat I am you!  It doesn't matter who they believe that you are.  Above all,\nChamu the butler must not see me.  When he is dismissed in the\nmorning he will tell tales for very spite, and take his chance of my\naccusing him of theft;  so be sure that he sees Tom Tripe search the cellar.\nThen he will confirm to the maharajah afterward that Tripe did search--\nand did see something--and that Blaine sahib did lock the cellar door\nafterward in anger, and put weights on it.  That is the important thing.\nBlaine sahib must drive the carriage again to the house of Mukhum Dass;\nand be sure that I am not kept waiting there--we must start before the\ndawn breaks!  Now give me paper and a pen to write the chit (letter) for\nMukhum Dass.\"\n\nThere was no ink in the bedroom;  Dick took her into the place he called\nhis study, and locked the door, glad of the excuse.  He was minded\nto know more of the intrigue before letting his wife go off again that\nnight on any wild adventure, second thoughts having stirred his caution.\nHe began by offering to lend her money, suspecting that a fugitive\nprincess would need that more than anything.  But she replied by drawing\nout from her bosom a packet containing thousands of rupees in Bank\nof India notes, and gave him money instead--not much, but she forced\nit on him.\n\n\"For the three beggars.  Ten rupees each.  Pay it them in silver in the\nmorning.  They have been very useful often, and may be so again.\"\n\nHe watched her write the letter and seal the envelope.  Then:\n\n\"Say,\" he said, \"don't you think you'd be doing right by telling me more\nof this?  I'll say nothing to a soul, but that little girl you're wanting to\nrun off with is my wife, and I'll admit I'm kind o' concerned on her account.\"\n\nYasmini met his iron-gray eyes, judged him and found him good.\n\n\"I never trusted man yet, not even the husband I shall marry, with all\nI shall tell you,\" she answered.  \"Will you give me silence in return for it?\"\n\n\"Mum as the grave,\" he answered.  And Dick Blaine kept his word, not\neven hinting to Tess on the long drive afterward that there had been\nas much as a question asked or confidence exchanged.  And Tess\nrespected the silence, not deceived for a minute by it.  He and Yasmini\nhad been longer in that room together than any one-page letter needed,\nand she was sure there was only one subject they discussed.\n\nDick brought Yasmini's horse to the gate, not to the door, and she\nmounted outside in the road for additional precaution.  Instantly, then,\nwithout a word of farewell she was off like the wind down-hill.\n\n\"It'll be all over town tomorrow that I'm dead or dying, if anybody sees\nher!\" Dick told his wife.  \"They'll swear that was you, Tess, riding full\npelt for the doctor!\"\n\nSoon after that Tom Tripe came, and made Chamu hold a light for\nhim while he searched the cellar.\n\n\"Hold the candle and your tongue too, confound you!\" he told the\ngrumbling butler, indignant at being brought from bed.\n\nDick had already put the silver tube in place.  Tom Tripe raised the\nstone and saw it--uttered a tremendous oath--and dropped the heavy\nstone back over the hole.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Dick demanded from the ladder-head, appearing\nwith a lantern from behind the raised trap.\n\n\"Looking for rum!\" Tom answered.  Then he turned on Chamu.  \"Did\nyou see what I saw?  Speak a word of it, you devil, and I'll tear your\nthroat out!  Silence, d'you understand?\"\n\n\"Come out of there!\" Dick ordered angrily.  \"I'll have to lock this cellar\ndoor!  I can't have people prospecting down there!  I've got reasons\nof my own for keeping that cellar undisturbed!  I'm surprised at you,\nTom Tripe, taking advantage of me when my back's turned!\"\n\nThe minute they were up he put a padlock on the trap, and nailed it\ndown to the beams as well.  Then, summoning Tom's aid, he levered\nand shoved into place on top of it the heavy iron safe in which he kept\nhis specimens and money.\n\n\"That'll do for you, Chamu!\" he said finally.  \"I don't care to keep a butler\nwho takes guests into the cellar at this hour of night!  You may go.  I'll\ngive you your time in the morning.\"\n\nChamu showed his teeth, by no means for the first time.  It was a favorite\nmethod of his for covering up bad service to fall back on his reference.\n\n\"Maharajah sahib who is recommending me will not be pleased at\nmy dismissal!\"\n\n\"You and your maharajah go to hell together!\" Dick retorted.  \"Tell him\nfrom me that I won't have inquisitive people in my cellar!  Now go;\nthere's nothing more to talk about.  Fire the cook, too, as soon as he\nwakes!  Tell him I don't like ground glass in my omelette!  Not been\nany in it?  Well, what do I care?  I don't want any in it--that's enough!\nI'm taking no chances.  Tell him he's fired, and you two pull your freight\ntogether in the morning first thing!\"\n\nTen minutes alone with Yasmini had worked wonders with Dick Blaine.\nGiven to making up his mind and seeing resolution through to stern\nconclusions, he was her stout ally from the moment when he unlocked\nthe study door again until the end--a good silent ally too busy, apparently,\nabout his own affairs to be suspected.  Certainly Samson never suspected\nhis real share in the intrigue--Samson, the judge of circumstances,\nindiscretions, men and opportunity.\n\nHe sent Tom Tripe packing, with a flea in his ear for Chamu's benefit,\nand a whispered word of friendship.  Later he drove Tess down-hill in\nthe dog-cart, first changing his own disguise for American clothes\nbecause the saises might be up and about when he returned at dawn,\nand for them to see him in the costume of a sais would only have added\nto the risk of putting Gungadhura's men on the scent of Yasmini.\nSaises are almost the most prolific source of rumor, but he had a means\nof stilling their tongues.\n\nThere was little to say during the dark drive.  They were affectionate,\nthose two, without too many words when it came to leave-taking, each\nknowing the other's undivided love.  Tess had money--a revolver--\ncartridges--some food--sufficient change of clothing for a week--\nsun-spectacles;  he reassured himself twice on all those points.\n\n\"If you're camel-sick, fetch it up and carry, on,\" he advised, \"it'll soon\npass.  Then a hot bath, if you can get it, before you stiffen.  Failing that, oil.\"\n\nThe camels, with Yasmini and her women already mounted, were kneeling\nin the darkness outside the house of Mukhum Dass.\n\n\"Come!\" called Yasmini.  \"Hurry!\"\n\nDick kissed his wife--waved his hand to Yasmini--helped Tess on to\nthe last camel in the kneeling line--and they were off, the camel-men\nnot needing to shout to make those Bikaniri racers rise and start.  They\nwere gone like ghosts into the darkness, making absolutely no noise,\nbefore Dick could steady his nervous horse.\n\nThen Ismail wanted to tie Yasmini's abandoned horse to the tail of the\ndog-cart, but Dick sent him off to stable it somewhere at the other side\nof town to help throw trackers off the scent.  He himself drove home\nby a very wide circuit indeed, threading his cautious way among the\nhills toward the gold-diggings, where he drove back and forward several\ntimes around the edges of the dump, in order that the saises might\nsee the red dirt on the wheels afterward and believe, and tell where\nhe had been.\n\nThere was some risk that a panther, or even a tiger might try for the\nhorse in the dark, but that was not the kind of danger that disturbed\nDick Blaine much.  A pistol at point-blank range is as good as a rifle\nmost nights of the week.  He arrived home after daylight with a very\nweary horse, and ordered the saises to wash the wheels at once, in\norder that the color of the dirt might be impressed on them thoroughly.\nThey were quite sure he had been at the mine all night.  Then he paid\noff Chamu and the cook and sent them packing.\n\nHe was looking for the beggars, to pay them, when Tom Tripe's dog\narrived and began hunting high and low for Tess.  Trotters had something\nin his mouth, wrapped in cloth and then again in leather.  He refused\nto give it to Dick, defying threats and persuasion both.  Dick offered\nhim food, but the dog had apparently eaten--water, but he would not drink.\n\nThen the three beggars came, and watched Dick's efforts with the\ninterest of spectators at a play.\n\n\"Messenge!\" said Bimbu finally, nodding at the dog.  That much was\npretty obvious.\n\n\"Princess!\" he added, seeing Dick was still puzzled.  It flashed across\nDick's mind that on the dresser in the bedroom was Tess's hat that\nYasmini had worn.  Doubtless to a dog's keen nose it smelt of both\nof them.  He ran to fetch it, the dog followed him, eager to get into the\nhouse.  He offered the hat to the dog, who sniffed it and yelped eagerly.\n\n\"Bang goes fifty dollars, then!\" he laughed.\n\nHe took the hat to Bimbu.\n\n\"Can you ride a camel?\" he demanded.\n\nThe man nodded.  \"Another would drive it.\"\n\n\"Do you know where to get one?\"\n\nBimbu nodded again.\n\n\"Take this hat, so that the dog will follow you, and ride by camel to the\nhome of Utirupa Singh.  Here is money for the camel. If you overtake\nthe princess there will be a fabulous reward.  If you get there soon\nafter she does there will be a good reward.  If you take too long on\nthe way there will be nothing for you but a beating!  Go--hurry--get a\nmove on!  And don't you lose the dog!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twelve\n\n\n\n\nThere are they who yet remember, when the depot's forty jaws\nThrough iron teeth that chatter to the tramping of a throng\nSpew out the crushed commuter in obedience to laws\nThat all accord observance and that all agree are wrong;\nWhen rush and din and hubbub stir the too responsive vein\nTill head and heart are conquered by the hustle roaring by\nAnd the sign looks good that glitters on the temple gate of Gain, -\n\"There are spaces just as luring where the leagues untrodden lie!\"\n\nThere are they who yet remember 'mid the fever of exchange,\nWhen the hot excitement throttles and the millions make or break,\nHow a camel's silent footfall on the ashen desert range\nSwings cushioned into distances where thoughts unfettered wake,\nAnd the memory unbidden plucks an unconverted heart\nTill the glamour goes from houses and emotion from the street,\nAnd the truth glares good and gainly in the face of 'change and mart:\n\"There are deserts more intensive.  There are silences as sweet!\"\n\n\n\"Ready for anything! If I weaken, tie me on the camel!\"\n\nThere are camels and camels--more kinds than there are of horses.\nThe Bishareen of the Sudan is not a bad beast, but compared to the\nBikaniri there are no other desert mounts worth a moment's consideration.\nFleet as the wind, silent as its own shadow, enduring as the long hot-\nseason of its home, the trained Bikaniri swings into sandy distances\nwith a gait that is a gallop really--the only saddle-beast of all that lifts\nhis four feet from the ground at once, seeming to spurn the very laws\nof gravity.\n\nThey are favored folk who come by first-class Bikaniri camels, for the\nbetter sort are rare, hard held to, and only to be bought up patiently by\ntwos and ones.  Fourteen of them in one string, each fit that instant for\na distance-race with death itself, was perhaps the best proof possible\nof Yasmini's influence on the country-side.  They were gathered for\nher and held in readiness by men who loved her and detested Gungadhura.\n\nNormally the drivers would have taken a passenger apiece, and seven\nof the animals would have been ample;  but this was a night and a dawn\nwhen speed was nine-tenths of the problem, and Yasmini had spared\nnothing--no man, no shred of pains or influence,--and proposed to spare\nno beast.\n\nThey rode in single file, each man with a led camel ridden by a woman,\nexcept that Yasmini directed her own mount and for the most part showed\nthe way, her desert-reared guide being hard put to keep his own animal\nabreast of her.  There is a gift--a trick of riding camels, very seldom\nlearned by the city-born;  and he, or she, who knows the way of it enjoys\nthe ungrudged esteem of desert men all the way from China to Damascus,\nfrom Peshawar to Morocco.  The camels detect a skilled hand even\nmore swiftly than a horse does and, like the horse, do their best work\nfor the rider who understands.  So the only sound, except for a gurgle\nnow and then, and velvet-silent footfalls on the level sand, was the\ngrunts of admiration of the men behind.  They had muffled all the camel-bells.\n\nWhen they started the night was deepest purple, set densely with a\nmass of colored jewels;  even the whitest of the stars stole color from\nthe rest.  But gradually, as they raced toward the sky-line and the stars\npaled, the sky changed into mauve.  Then without warning a belt of pale\ngold shone in the west behind them, and with the false dawn came the\ncool wind like a legacy from the kindly night-gods to encourage humans\nto endure the day.  A little later than the wind the true dawn came, fiery\nwith hot promise, and Tess on the last camel soon learned the meaning\nof the cloak Yasmini had made her wear.  Worn properly it covers all\nthe face except the eyes, leaving no surface for the hot wind to torture,\nand saving the lips and lungs from being scorched.\n\nIn after years, when Yasmini was intriguing for an empire that in her\nimagination should control the world, she had the telegraph and telephone\nat times to aid her, as well as the organized, intricate system of British\nGovernment to manipulate from behind the scenes;  but now she was\nracing against the wires, and in no mood to appeal for help to a government\nthat she did not quite understand as yet, but intended to foot royally\nin any case.\n\nThe easiest thing Gungadhura could do, and surest thing he would\nattempt once word should reach him that she had vanished from Sialpore\nwould be to draw around her a network of his own men.  Watchers\nfrom the hills and lurkers in the sand-dunes could pass word along of\nthe direction she had taken;  and the sequel, if Gungadhura was only\nquick enough, would depend simply on the loneliness or otherwise\nof the spot where she could be brought to bay.  If there were no\nwitnesses his problem would be simple.  But if murder seemed too\ndangerous, there was the Nesting-place of Seven Swans up in the\nmountains, as well as other places even lonelier, to which she and\nTess could be abducted.  Tess might be left, perhaps, to make her\nown way back and give her own explanation of flight with a maharajah's\ndaughter;  but for Yasmini abduction to the hills could only mean one\nof two things:  unthinkable surrender, or sure death by any of a hundred\nsecret means.\n\nSo the way they took was wild and lonely, frequented only by the little\njackals that eat they alone know what, and watched by unenthusiastic\nkites that always seemed to be wheeling in air just one last time before\nflying to more profitable feeding ground.  Yet within a thousand paces\nof the line they took lay a trodden track, well marked by the sun-dried\nbones of camels (for the camel dies whenever he feels like it, without\nexplanation or regret, and lies down for the purpose in the first\nuncomfortable place to hand).\n\nYasmini and the guide between them, first one, then the other assuming\nthe direction, led the way around low hills and behind the long, blown\nfolds of sand netted scantly down by tufted, dry grass, always avoiding\nopen spaces where they might be seen, or hollows too nearly shut in\non both sides, where there might be ambush.\n\nTwice they were seen before the sun was two hours high, the first time\nby a caravan of merchants headed toward Sialpore, who breasted a\nhigh dune half a mile away and took no notice;  but that would not prevent\nthe whole caravansary in the city's midst from knowing what they had\nseen, and just how long ago, and headed which way, within ten minutes\nafter they arrived--as, in fact, exactly happened.\n\nThe second party to catch sight of them consisted of four men on camels,\nwhose rifles, worn military fashion with a sling, betrayed them as\nGungadhura's men.  \"Desert police\" he called them.  \"Takers of tenths\"\nwas the popular, and much more accurate description.  The four gave\nchase, for a caravan in a hurry is always likely to pay well for exemption\nfrom delay;  and coming nearly at right angles they had all the advantage.\nIt was crime to refuse to halt for them,  for they were semi-military,\nuniformed police.  Yet their invariable habit of prying into everything\nand questioning each member of a caravan would be certain to lead\nto discovery.  They had a signal station on the hill two miles behind\nthem, to keep them in touch with other parties, north, south, east and west.\nIt looked like Yasmini's undoing, for they were gaining two for one\nalong the shorter course.  Tess fingered the pistol her husband had\nmade her bring, wondering whether Yasmini would dare show fight\n(not guessing yet the limitless abundance of her daring), and wondering\nwhether she herself would dare reply to the fire of authorized policemen.\nShe did not relish the thought of being an outlaw with a genuine excuse\nfor her arrest.\n\nBut the four police were oversure, and Yasmini too quick-witted for them.\nThey took a short cut down into a sandy hollow, letting their quarry get\nout of sight, plainly intending to wait on rising ground about a thousand\nyards ahead, where they could foil attempts to circumvent them and,\nfor the present, take matters easy.\n\nInstantly Yasmini changed direction, swinging her camel to the right,\ndown a deep nullah, and leading full pelt at right angles to her real course.\nIt was ten minutes before the men caught sight of them again, and by\nthat time they had nearly drawn abreast, well beyond reasonable rifle\nrange, and were heading back toward their old direction, so that the\npolice had lost advantage, and a stern chase on slower camels was\ntheir only hope but one.  They fired half a dozen shots by way of calling\nattention to themselves--then wheeled and raced away toward the\nsignal station on the hill.\n\nYasmini held her course for an hour after that, until a spur of the hillside\nand another long fold of the desert shut them off from the signaler's view.\nThere she called a halt, unexpectedly, for the camels did not need it.\nShe was worried about Tess--the one untested link in her chain of fugitives.\n\n\"Can you keep on through all the hot day?\" she asked. \"These other\nwomen are as lithe as leopards, for I make them dance.  They are better\nable to endure than cheetahs.  But you?  Shall I put two women on\none camel, and send you back to Sialpore with two men?\"\n\nTess's back ached and she was dizzy, but her own powers had been\ntested many a time;  this was not more than double the strain she had\nwithstood before, and she was aware of strength in reserve, to say\nnothing of conviction that what Yasmini's maids could do she herself\nwould rather perish than fall short of.  There is an element of sheer,\npugnacious, unchristian human pride that is said to damn, while it saves\nthe best of us at times.\n\n\"Certainly not!  I can carry on all day!\" she answered.\n\nYasmini emitted her golden bell-like laugh that expressed such\nimmeasurable understanding and delight in all she understands.  (It has\novertones that tell of vision beyond the ken of folk who build on mud.)\n\n\"The maids shall knead your muscles for you at the other end,\" she\nanswered.  \"Courage is good!  You are my sister!  You shall see things\nthat the West knows nothing of!  If those thrice-misbegotten Takers\nof Tenths had not seen us, we would have reached our goal a little after\nmidday.  As it is, they have certainly signaled to another party of\nGungadhura's spawn somewhere ahead of us, who will be coming\nthis way with eyes open and a lesson in mind for those who disregard\ntheir comrades' challenge to halt and be looted!  When I am maharanee\n there shall be a new system of protecting desert roads!  But I dare\nnot try conclusions now.  We must take a wide circuit and not reach\nour destination until night falls.  Are you willing?\"\n\n\"Ready for anything!\" said Tess.  \"If I weaken, tie me on the camel!\"\n\n\"Good!  So speaks a woman!  One woman of spirit is the master of a\ndozen men--always.\n\nThey all drank sparingly of tepid water, ate a little of the food each had,\nand were off again without letting the camels kneel--heading now away\nfrom the hills toward a dazzling waste of silver sand, across which the\neyes lost all sense of perspective, and all power to separate three\nobjects in a row;  a land of mirage and monotony, glittering in places\nwith the aching white of salt deposits.\n\nThe heat increased, but the speed never slackened for an instant.  Flies\nemerged from everywhere to fasten on to unprotected skin, and the\nonly relief from them was under the hot cloaks that burned them with\nthe heat absorbed from sun and wind.  But even in that ghastly wilderness\nthere were other living things.  Now and then a lean leopard stole away\nfrom in front of them;  and once they saw a man, naked and thinner\nthan a rake, striding along a ridge on heaven knew what errand.  There\nwere scorpions everywhere.\n\nHour after hour, guided by desert-instinct that needs no compass, and\never alert for sky-line watchers, Yasmini and the headman took turns\nin giving direction, he yielding to her whenever their judgment differed.\nAnd whether she was right or not in every instance, she brought them\nat last to a little desert oasis, where there was brackish water deep\ndown in a sand-hole, and a great rock offered shadow to rest in.\n\nThere they lay until the sun declined far enough to lose a little of his\npower to scorch, and the camels bubbled to one another, thirstless,\nunwearied, dissatisfied, as the universal way of camels is, kneeling in\na circle, rumps outward, each one resentful of the other's neighborhood\nand, above all, disgruntled at man's tyranny.\n\n\"By now,\" laughed Yasmini, smoking one of Tess's cigarettes in the\nshadow of the rock, \"Gungadhura knows surely that my palace is empty\nand the bird has flown.  Ten dozen different people will have carried\nto him as many accounts of it, and each will have offered different\nexplanation and advice!  I wonder what Jinendra's fat priest has to say\nabout it!  Gungadhura will have sent for him.  He would hardly ride to\nthe priest through the streets, even in a carriage, with that love-token\nstill raw and smarting with which I marked his face!  Two reliable reports\nwill have reached him already as to which direction I have taken.  Yet\nthe telegraph will have told him that I have not been seen to cross the\nborder, and he will be wondering--wondering.  May he wonder until his\nbrains whirl round and sicken him!\"\n\n\"What can he do?\" suggested Tess.\n\n\"Do?  He can be spiteful.  He will enter my palace and remove the\nfurniture, taking my mother's legacies to his own lair--where I shall\nrecover them all within three weeks--and his own beside!  I will be\nmaharanee within the month!\"\n\n\"Aren't you a wee bit previous?\" suggested Tess.\n\n\"Not I!  I never boast.  My mother taught me that.  Or when I do boast\nit is to put men off the scent.  I boasted once to Samson sahib when\nbe offered to have me sent to college, telling him I was in the same\nschool as himself and would learn the quicker.  He has wondered ever\nsince then what I meant.        \"Krishna!\" she laughed impiously. \"I wonder\nwhat Samson sahib would not give to have me in his clutches at this\nminute!  Have I told you that Gungadhura plots with the Northwest tribes,\nand that the English know it?  No?  Didn't I tell you?  Samson sahib\nwould give me almost anything I asked, if he knew that it was I who\ntold his government of Gungadhura's plots;  he would know then that\nwith my knowledge to guide him he would be more than a match for\nGungadhura, instead of a ball kicked this and that way between\nGungadhura and the English!  Sometimes I almost think he would\nconsent to try to make me maharanee!\"\n\n\"Why not give him the chance then?\"\n\n\"For two reasons.  The English too often desert their commissioners.\nMy sure way is better than his blundering attempts!  The other reason\nis an even better one, and you shall know it soon.  I think--I do not know--\nI think, and I hope that the fat high priest of Jinendra is playing me false,\nand has gone to Samson sahib to make a bargain with him.  Samson\nsahib will consent to no bargains with that fat fool, if I am any judge of\nhucksters;  but he will have his ears on end and his eyes sore with over-\nwatchfulness from now forward!  Oh, I hope Jinendra's priest has gone\nto him!  I tried to stir treachery in his mind by brow-beating him about\nthe bargain that be tried to force from me!\"\n\n\"But what are you and the priest and Samson all bargaining about?\"\ndemanded Tess.\n\n\"The treasure of Sialpore!  But I make no bargains!  I, who know where\nthe treasure is!  Why should I offer to share what is mine?  I will have\na marriage contract drawn, and you shall be a witness.  That treasure\nis my dowry.  Listen!  Bubru Singh my father died without a son--the\nfirst of all that long line who left no son to follow him.  The custom was\nthat he should tell his son, and none else, the secret of the treasure.\nHe hated Gungadhura;  and, not knowing which the English would\nchoose for his successor, Gungadhura or another man, he told no one,\nmaking only hints to my mother on his death-bed and saying that if I,\nhis daughter, ever developed brains enough to learn the secret of the\ntreasure, then I might also have wit enough to win the throne and all\nwould be well.\"\n\n\"And you discovered it?  How did you discover it?\"\n\n \"Not I.\"\n\n\"Who then?\"\n\n\"Your husband did!\"\n\n\"My husband?  Dick Blaine?  But that can't be true;  he never told me;\nhe tells me everything.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he would have told if he had understood.  He hardly understands\nyet.  Only in part--a little.\"\n\n\"Then how in the world--?\"\n\nYasmini's golden laugh cut short the question as she rose to her feet\nwith a glance at the westering sun.\n\n\"Let us go.  Two hours from now we shall cross the border into another\nstate.  Two hours after night-fall our journey is ended.  Then the last\ngame begins--the last chukker--and I win!\"\n\nTess wished then that they had never halted!  The rest had given her\nmuscles time to stiffen, and her nerves the opportunity to learn how\ntired they were.  As the camels rose jerkily and followed their leader\nin line at the same fast pace as before she grew sick with the agony\nof aching bones and the utter weariness of motion repeated again and\nagain without varying or ceasing.  Every ligament in her body craved\nonly stillness, but the camel's unaccustomed thrust and sway continued,\nrepeated to infinity, until her nerves grew numb and she was hardly\nconscious of time, distance, or direction.\n\nOnce again there was pursuit, but Tess was hardly conscious of it--\nhardly realized that shots were fired--clinging to the saddle in the misery\nof a sickness more weakening and deathly than the sort small boats\nprovide at sea.  The sun went down and left her cooler, but not recovered.\nShe knew nothing of boundaries, or of the changing nature of the country-\nside.  It meant nothing to her that they were passing great trees now,\nand that once they crossed a stream by a wide stone bridge.  The only\nthought that kept drumming in her mind was that Dick, the ever dependable,\nhad misinformed her.  She had \"fetched it up\"--a dozen times.  True\nto his instruction, she had \"carried on.\"  But it did not pass!  She felt\nmore sick, more agonized, more weary every minute.\n\nBut at last, because there is an end even to the motion of a camel, in\nthis world of example instances, about two hours after nightfall the\ncaravan halted in the shadow of great trees beside a stone house with\na wall about it.  Her camel knelt with a motion like a landslide, and Tess\nfell off forward on the ground and fainted, only snatched away by strong\nhands in the nick of time to save her from the camel's teeth.  Uncertain,\nunforgiving brutes are camels--ungrateful for the toil men put them to.\nFor an hour after that she was only dimly conscious of being laid on\nsomething soft, and of supple, tireless women's hands that kneaded\nher, and kneaded her, taking the weary muscles one by one and coaxing\nthem back to painlessness.\n\nSo she did not see the dog arrive--Trotters, the Rampore-Great Dane,\ncousin to half the mongrel stock of Hindustan, slobbering on a package\nthat his set jaws hardly could release;  Yasmini, scornful of the laws\nof caste and ever responsive to a true friend, pried it loose with strong\nfingers.  It was she, too, who saw to the dog's needs--fed him and gave\nhim drink--removed a thorn from his forefoot and made much of him.\nShe even gave Bimbu food, with her own hands, and saw that his driver\nand camel had a place to rest in, before she undid the string that bound\nthe leather jacket of the package.\n\nBimbu on the camel had led the dog by the short route and, having\nnothing to be robbed of, had had small trouble with policemen on the way.\n\nThe first thing Tess was really conscious of when she regained her\nsenses was a great dog that slumbered restlessly beside her own\nfinger-marked, disheveled, dusty, fifty-dollar hat on the floor near by,\nawaking at intervals to sniff her hand and reassure himself--then returning\nto the hat to sleep, and gallop in his sleep;  a rangy, gray, enormous\nbeast with cavernous jaws that she presently recognized as Trotters.\n\nThen came the maids again, afraid for their very lives of the dog, but\nstill more mindful of Yasmini's orders.  They resumed their kneading\nof stiff muscles, rubbing in oil that smelt of jasmine, singing incantations\nwhile they worked.  They lifted the bed away from the wall, and one\nof the women danced around and around it rhythmically, surrounding\nTess with what the West translates as \"influence\"--the spell that all the\nEast knows keeps away evil interference.\n\nLast of all by candlelight, Yasmini came, scented and fresh and smiling\nas the flower from which she has her name, dressed now in the soft-hued\nsilken garments of a lady of the land.\n\n\"Where did you get them?\" Tess asked her.\n\n\"These clothes?  Oh, I have friends here.  Have no fear now--there are\nfriends on every side of us.\"\n\nShe showed Tess a letter, pierced in four places by a dog's eye-teeth.\n\n\"This is from Samson sahib.  Do you remember how I prayed that\nJinendra's priest might think to play me false?  I think he has.  Some\none has been to Samson sahib.  Hear this:\n\n        \"'The Princess Yasmini Omanoff Singh,\n        \"'Your Highness,\n                \"'Word has reached me frequently of late of pressure brought\n        to bear on you from certain quarters, and hints have been dropped\n        in my hearing that the object of the pressure is to induce you to\n        disclose a secret you possess.  Let me assure you that my official\n        protection from all illegal restraint and improper treatment is at your\n        service.  Further, that in case your secret is such as concerns vitally\n        the political relations, present or future, of Sialpore the proper\n        person to whom to confide it is myself.  Should you see your way to\n        take that only safe course, you may rest assured that your own\n        interests will be cared for in every way possible.\n                \"'I have the honor to be,\n                \"'Your Highness' obedient servant,\n                \"'Roland Samson, K. C. S. I.'\"\n\n\"That looks fair enough,\" said Tess.  \"I dislike Samson for reasons of\nmy own, but--\"\n\n\"Hah!\" laughed Yasmini.  \"He makes love to you!  Is it not so?  He would\nmake love to me if I gave him opportunity!  What a jest for the gods if\nI should play that game with him and make him marry me!  I could!  I\ncould make of Samson a power in India!  But the man would weary\nme with his conceit and his 'orders from higher up' within a week.  I\ncan have power without his help!  What a royal jest, though, to marry\nSamson and intrigue with all the jealous English wives who think they\npull the strings of government!\"\n\n\"You'd get the worst of it,\" laughed Tess.\n\n\"Maybe.  I shall never try it.  I am more of the East than the West.  But\nI will answer Samson.  Bimbu shall remain here lest he talk too much,\nbut the dog shall take a letter to Tom Tripe at dawn.  Samson knew hours\nago that I have flown the nest.  He will wonder how Tom Tripe holds\ncommunication with me, and so swiftly, and will have greater respect\nfor him--which may serve us later.\"\n\n\"Let me add a letter to my husband then, to tell him I'm safe.\"\n\n\"Surely.  But now eat.  Eat and be strong.  Can you stand?  Can you walk?\nHave the maids put new life in you?\"\n\nTess was astonished at her swift recovery.  She was a little stiff--a little\nweak--a little tired;  but she could walk up and down the room with her\nnatural gait and Yasmini clapped her hands.\n\n\"I will order food brought. Listen!  Tonight I am Abhisharika.  Do you\nknow what that is--Abhisharika?\"\n\nTess shook her head.\n\n\"I go to my lover of my own accord!\"\n\n\"That sounds more like West than East!\"\n\n\"You think so?  You shall come with me and see!  You shall play the\npart of cheti (the indispensable hand-maiden)--you and Hasamurti.\nYou must dress like her.  Simply be still and watch, and you shall see!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Thirteen\n\n\n\n\nOf what use were the gift of gods,\nThe buoyant sweetness of a virgin state,\nThe blossomy delight of youth\nAblow with promise of fruit consummate;\nWhat use the affluence of song\nAnd marvel of delicious motion meet\nTo grace the very revelings of Fawn,\nCould she not lay them at another's feet?\n\n\n\"I am a king's daughter!\"\n\nThat was a night when the full-moon rose in a sea of silver, and changed\ninto amber as it mounted in the sky.  The light shone like liquid honey,\nand the shadowed earth was luminous and still.  The very deepest of\nthe shadows glowed with undertones of half-suggested color.  Hardly\na zephyr moved.\n\n\"You see?\" said Yasmini.  \"The gods are our servants!  They have\nset the stage!\"\n\nHand in hand--Yasmini in the midst in spotless silken white;  Tess and\nHasamurti draped in black from head to foot--they left the house by a\nhigh teak door in the garden wall and started down a road half hidden\nby lacy shadows.  All three wore sandals on bare feet, and Tess was\nafraid at first of insects.\n\n\"Have no fear of anything tonight,\" Yasmini whispered.  \"The gods are\nall about us!  Wasuki, who is king of all the snakes, is on our side!\"\n\nOne could not speak aloud, for the spell of mystery overlay everything.\nThey walked into the very heart of silent beauty.  Overhead, enormous\ntrees, in which the sacred monkeys slept, dropped tendrils like long\narms yearning with the love of mother earth.  Here and there the embers\nof a dying fire glowed crimson, and the only occasional sound was of\nsleepy cattle that chewed the cud contentedly--or when a monkey moved\nabove them to change his roost.  Once, a man's voice singing by a\nfireside conjured back for a moment the world's hard illusion;  but the\nstillness and the mystery overcame him too, and all was true again,\nand wonderful.\n\nHand in hand they followed the road to its end and turned into a lane\nbetween thorn hedges.  Now the moon shone straight toward them and\nthere was no shadow, so that the earth was bright golden underfoot--\na lane of mellow light on which they trod between fantastic woven walls.\nAt the end of the lane they came into a clearing at a forested-edge,\nwhere an ancient ruined temple nestled in the shadow of great trees,\nits stone front and the seated image of a long-neglected god restored\nto more than earthly sanctity and peace by the cool, caressing moonlight.\n\n\"Jinendra again!\" Yasmini whispered.  \"Always Jinendra!  His priests\nare rascals, but the god himself is kind!  When I am maharanee, that\ntemple shall stand whole again!\"\n\nIn front of the temple, between them and the trees, was a pond edged\nwith carved stone.  Lotus leaves floated on the water, and one blue\nflower was open wide to welcome whoever loved serenity.\n\nStill hand in hand, they crossed the clearing mid-way to the pond, and\nthere Yasmini bade them stand.\n\n\"Draw no nearer.  Only stand and watch.\"\n\nShe had a great blue flower in her bosom that heaved and fell for proof\nof her own emotion.  Hasamurti's hand was trembling as she nestled\ncloser, and Tess felt her own pulsing to quick heart-beats as she\nclasped the girl's.\n\nYasmini left them, and walked alone to the very edge of the pond, where\nshe stood still for several minutes, apparently gazing at her own reflection\nin the moonlit water--or perhaps listening.  There was no sign of any\none else, nor sound of footfall.  Then, as if the reflection satisfied, or\nshe had heard some whisper meant for her and none else, she began\nto dance, moving very slowly in the first few rhythmic steps, resembling\na water-goddess, the clinging silk displaying her young outline as she\nbent and swayed.\n\nShe might have been watching her reflection still, so close she danced\nto the water's edge with her back turned to the moon.  But presently\nthe dance grew quicker, and extended arms that glistened in the light\nlike ivory increased the sinuous perfection of each pose.  Still there\nwas nothing wild in it--nothing but the very spirit of the moonlight, beautiful\nand kind and full of peace.  She moved now around the water, in a\nmeasured cadence that by some unfathomable witchery of her devising\nconveyed a thought of maidenhood and modesty.  It dawned on Tess,\nwho watched her spell-bound, that there was not one immodest thought\nin all Yasmini's throng of moods, but only a scorn of all immodesty\nand its pretensions.  And whether that was art, or sheer expression of\nthe truth within her rather than a recognition of the truth without, Tess\nnever quite determined;  for it is easier to judge spoken word and\nunexpected deed than to see the thought behind it.  That night Yasmini's\nmood was simpler and less unseemly than the very virgin dress she wore.\n\nPresently she danced more swiftly, making no sound, so phantom-light\nand graceful that the rhythm of her movement carried her with scarce\na touch to earth.  That was strength as well as art, but the art made strength\nseem spiritual power to float on air.  Gaiety grew now into her cadences--\nthe utter joy of being young.  She seemed to revel in a sense of buoyancy\nthat could lift her above all the grim deceptions of the world of wrath\nand iron, and make her, like the moonlight, all-kind, all-conquering.\nThree times round the pond she leapt and gamboled in an ecstasy of\nyouth undisillusioned.\n\nThen the dance changed, though there was yet in it the heart of gaiety.\nThere moved now in the steps a sense of mystery--a consciousness\nof close infinity unfolding, far more subtly signified than by the clumsy\nshift of words.  And she welcomed all the mystery--greeted it with\noutstretched arms--was glad of it, and eager-impetuous to know the\nnew worlds and the ways undreamed of.  Minute after minute, rhapsody\non rhapsody, she wooed the near, untouchable delights that, like the\nmoonbeams, seem but empty nothing when the drudges seize them\nfor their palaces of mud.\n\nNor did she woo in vain.  There were stanzas in her dance of simple\ngratitude, as if the spirit of the mystery had found her mood acceptable\nand dowered her with new ability to see, and know, and understand.\nEven the two watchers, hand in hand a hundred paces off, felt something\nof the power of vision she had gained, and thrilled at its wonder.\n\nBorne on new wings of fancy now her dance became a very image of\nthose infinite ideas she had seen and felt.  She herself, Yasmini, was\na part of all she saw--mistress of all she knew--own sister of the beauty\nin the moonlight and the peace that filled the glade.  The night itself--\nmoon, sky and lotus-dappled water--trees -growth and grace and stillness,\nwere part of her and she of them.  Verily that minute she, Yasmini,\ndanced with the gods and knew them for what in truth they are--ideas\na little lower, a little less essential than the sons of men.\n\nThen, as if that knowledge were the climax of attainment, and its ownership\na spell that could command the very lips of night, there came a man's\nvoice calling from the temple in the ancient Rajasthani tongue.\n\n\"Oh, moon of my desire!  Oh, dear delight!  Oh, spirit of all gladness!  Come!\"\n\nInstantly the dance ceased.  Instantly the air of triumph left her.  As a\nflower's petals shut at evening, fragrant with promise of a dawn to come,\nshe stood and let a new mood clothe her with humility;  for all that grace\nof high attainment given her were nothing, unless she, too, made of it\na gift.  That night her purpose was to give the whole of what she knew\nherself to be.\n\nSo, with arms to her sides and head erect, she walked straight toward\nthe temple;  and a man came out to meet her, tall and strong, who strode\nlike a scion of a stock of warriors.  They met mid-way and neither spoke,\nbut each looked in the other's eyes, then took each other's hands, and\nstood still minute after minute.  Hasamurti, gripping Tess's fingers,\ncaught her breath in something like a sob, while Tess could think of\nnothing else than Brynhild's oath:\n\n        \"O Sigurd, Sigurd,\n        Now hearken while I swear!\n        The day shall die forever\n        And the sun to darkness wear\n        Ere I forget thee, Sigurd....\"\n\nHer lips repeated it over and over, like a prayer, until the man put his\narm about Yasmini and they turned and walked together to the temple.\nThen Hasamurti tugged at Tess, and they followed, keeping their distance,\nuntil Yasmini and her lover sat on one stone in the moonlight on the\ntemple porch, their faces clearly lighted by the mellow beams.  Then\nTess and Hasamurti took their stand again, hand in each other's hand,\nand watched once more.\n\nIt was love-making such as Tess had never dreamed of,--and Tess\nwas no familiar of hoydenish amours;  gentle--poetic--dignified on his\npart--manly as the plighting of the troth of warriors' sons should be.\nYasmini's was the attitude of simple self-surrender, stripped of all\npretense, devoid of any other spirit than the will to give herself and all\nshe had, and knowledge that her gift was more than gold and rubles.\n\nFor an hour they sat together murmuring questions and reply, heart\nanswering to heart, eyes reading eyes, and hand enfolding hand;  until\nat last Yasmini rose to leave him and he stood like a lord of squadroned\nlances to watch her go.\n\n\"Moon of my existence!\" was his farewell speech to her.\n\n\"Dear lord!\" she answered.  Then she turned and went, not looking\nback at him, walking erect, as one whose lover is the son of twenty kings.\nWithout a word she took Tess and Hasamurti by the hand, and, looking\nstraight before her with blue eyes glowing at the welling joy of thoughts\ntoo marvelous for speech, led them to the lane--the village street--and\nthe door in the wall again.  The man was still gazing after her, erect\nand motionless, when Tess turned her head at the beginning of the\nlane;  but Yasmini never looked back once.\n\n\"Why did you never tell me his name?\" Tess asked;  but if Yasmini\nheard the question she saw fit not to answer it.  Not a word passed her\nlips until they reached the house, crossed the wide garden between\npomegranate shrubs, and entered the dark door across the body of a\nsleeping watchman--or a watchman who could make believe he slept.  Then:\n\n\"Good night!\" she said simply.  \"Sleep well!  Sweet dreams!  Come,\nHasamurti--your hands are cleverer than the other women's.\"\n\nDaughter of a king, and promised wife of a son of twenty kings, she\ntook the best of the maids to undress her, without any formal mockery\nof excuse.  Two of the other women were awake to see Tess into bed--\nno mean allowance for a royal lady's guest.\n\nVery late indeed that night Tess was awakened by Yasmini's hand\nstroking the hair back from her forehead.  Again there was no explanation,\nno excuse.  A woman who was privileged to see and hear what Tess\nhad seen and heard, needed no apology for a visit in the very early hours.\n\n\"What do you think of him?\" she asked.  \"How do you like him?  Tell me!\"\n\n\"Splendid!\" Tess answered, sitting up to give the one word emphasis.\n\"But why did you never tell me his name?\"\n\n\"Did you recognize him?\"\n\n\"Surely! At once--first thing!\"\n\n\"No true-born Rajputni ever names her lover or her husband.\"\n\n\"But you knew that I know Prince Utirupa Singh.  He came to my garden party!\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, no Rajputni names her lover to another man or woman--\ncalling him by his own name only in retirement, to his face.\"\n\n\"Why--he--isn't he the one who Sir Roland Samson told me ought to\nhave been maharajah instead of Gungadhura?\"\n\nYasmini nodded and pressed her hand.\n\n\"Tomorrow night you shall see another spectacle.  Once, when Rajputana\nwas a veritable land of kings, and not a province tricked and conquered\nby the English, there was a custom that each great king held a durbar,\nto which princes came from everywhere, in order that the king's daughter\nmight choose her own husband from among them.  The custom died,\nalong with other fashions that were good.  The priests killed it, knowing\nthat whatever fettered women would increase their sway.  But I will revive it--\nas much as may be, with the English listening to every murmur of their\nspies and the great main not yet thrown.  I have no father, but I need none.\nI am a king's daughter!  Tomorrow night I will single out my husband,\nand name him by the title under which I shall marry him--in the presence\nof such men of royal blood as can be trusted with a secret for a day\nor two!  There are many who will gladly see the end of Gungadhura!\nBut I must try to sleep--I have hardly slept an hour.  If a maid were awake\nto sing to me--but they sleep like the dead after the camel-ride, and\nHasamurti, who sings best, is weariest of all.\"\n\n\"Suppose I sing to you?\" said Tess.\n\n\"No, no;  you are tired too.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!  It's nearly morning.  I have slept for hours.  Let me come\nand sing to you.\"\n\n\"Can you?  Will you?  I am full of gladness, and my brain whirls with a\nthousand thoughts, but I ought to sleep.\"\n\nSo Tess went to Yasmini's room, and sat beneath the punkah crooning\nMoody and Sankey hymns and darky lullabies, until Yasmini dropped\ninto the land of dreams.  Then, listening to the punkah's regular soft\nswing, she herself fell forward on her arms, half-resting on the bed,\nhalf on the chair, until Hasamurti crept in silently and, laughing, lifted\nher up beside Yasmini and left her there until the two awoke near noon,\nwondering, in each other's arms.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Fourteen\n\n\n\n\nHe who is most easily persuaded is perhaps a fool, for the world is\nfull of fools, and it is dangerous to deal with them.  But perhaps he\nis a man who sees his own advantage hidden in the folds of your\nproposal; and that is dangerous too. --Eastern Proverb\n\n\n\"Acting on instructions from Your Highness!\"\n\nIt tickled Gungadhura's vanity to have an Englishman in his employ;\nbut Tom Tripe never knew from one day to another what his next\nreception would be.  On occasion it would suit the despot's sense of\nhumor to snub and slight the veteran soldier of a said-to-be superior\nrace;  and he would choose to do that when there was least excuse\nfor it.  On the other hand, he recognized Tom as almost indispensable;\nhe could put a lick and polish on the maharajah's troops that no amount\nof cursing and coaxing by their own officers accomplished.  Tom\nunderstood to a nicety that drift of the Rajput's martial mind that caused\neach sepoy to believe himself the equal of any other Rajput man, but\npermitted him to tolerate fierce disciplining by an alien.\n\nAnd Tom had his own peculiarities.  Born in a Shorncliffe barrack hut,\nhe had a feudal attitude toward people of higher birth.  As for a prince--\nthere was almost no limit to what he would not endure from one, without\nconcerning himself whether the prince was right or wrong.  Not that he\ndid not know his rights;  his limitations were not Prussian;  he would\nstand up for his rights, and on their account would answer the maharajah\nback more bluntly and even offensively than Samson, for instance,\nwould have dreamed of doing.  But a prince was a prince, and that\nwas all about it.\n\nSo, on the morning following the flight of Yasmini and Tess, Tom,\nsore-eyed from lack of sleep but with an eye-opener of raw brandy\ninside him, and a sense of irritation due to the absence of his dog,\nroundly cursed nine unhappy mahouts for having dared let an elephant\nsteal his rum--drilled two companies of heavy infantry in marching order\non parade until the sweat ran down into their boots and each miserable\nman saw two suns in the sky where one should be--dismissed them\nwith a threat of extra parades for a month to come unless they picked\ntheir feet up cleaner--and reported, with his heart in his throat, at\nGungadhura's palace.\n\nAs luck would have it, the Sikh doctor was just leaving.  It always suited\nthat doctor to be very friendly with Tom Tripe, because there were\npickings, in the way of sick certificates that Tom could pass along to\nhim, and shortcomings that Tom could overlook.  He told Tom that the\nmaharajah was in no mood to be spoken to, and in no condition to be seen.\n\n\"Then you go back and tell his highness,\" Tom retorted,  \"that I've got\nto speak with him!  Business is business!\"\n\nThe doctor used both hands to illustrate.\n\n\"But his cheek is cut with a great gash from here to here!  He was testing\na sword-blade in the armory, last night, and it broke and pierced him.\"\n\n\"Hasn't a soldier like me seen wounds before?  I don't swoon away\nat the sight of blood!  He can do his talking through a curtain if he's minded!\"\n\n\"I would not dare, Mr. Tripe!  He has given orders.  You must ask one\nof the eunuchs--really.\"\n\n\"I thought you and I were friends?\" said Tom, with whiskers bristling.\n\n\"Always!  I hope always!  But in this instance--\"\n\nTom folded both arms behind his back, drill-master-on-parade fashion.\n\n\"Suit yourself,\" he answered.  \"Friendship's friendship.  Scratch my\nback and I'll scratch yours.  I want to see his highness.  I want to see\nhim bad.  You're the man that's asked to turn the trick for me.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Tripe, I will try.  I will try.  But what shall I tell him?\"\n\nTom hesitated.  That doctor was a more or less discreet individual,\nor he would not have been sent for.  Besides, he had lied quite plausibly\nabout the dagger-wound.  But there are limits.\n\n\"Tell him,\" he said presently, \"that I've found the man who left that\nsword in his armory o' purpose for to injure him!  Say I need private\nand personal instructions quick!\"\n\nThe doctor returned up the palace steps.  Ten minutes later he came\ndown again smiling, with the word that Tom was to be admitted.  In a\nhurry, then, Tom's brass spurs rang on Gungadhura's marble staircase\nwhile a breathless major-domo tried to keep ahead of him.  One takes\nno chances with a man who can change his mind as swiftly as Gungadhura\nhabitually did.  Without a glance at silver shields, boars' heads, tiger-skins,\ncurtains and graven gold ornaments beyond price, or any of the other\ntrappings of royal luxury, Tom followed the major-domo into a room\nfurnished with one sole divan and a little Buhl-work table.  The maharajah,\nsprawling on the divan in a flowered silk deshabille and with his head\nswathed in bandages, ignored Tom Tripe's salute, and snarled at the\nmajor-domo to take himself out of sight and hearing.\n\nSoldier-fashion, as soon as the door had closed behind him Tom stood\non no ceremony, but spoke first.\n\n\"There was a fracas last night, Your Highness, outside a certain palace\ngate.\"  He pronounced the word to rhyme with jackass, but Gungadhura\nwas not in a mood to smile.  \"An escaped elephant bumped into the\ngate and bent it.  The guard took to their heels;  so I've locked 'em all up,\nsolitary, to think their conduct over.\"\n\nThe maharajah nodded.\n\n\"Good!\" he said curtly.\n\n\"I cautioned the relieving guard that if they had a word to say to any one\nthey'd follow the first lot into cells.  It don't do to have it known that\nelephants break loose that easy.\"\n\n\"Good!\"\n\n\"Subsequently, acting on instructions from Your Highness, I searched\nthe cellar of Mr. Blaine's house on the hill, Chamu the butler holding\na candle for me.\"  \"What did he see?  What did that treacherous swine\nsee?\" snapped Gungadhura, pushing back the bandage irritably from\nthe corner of his mouth.\n\n\"Nothing, Your Highness, except that he saw me lift a stone and look\nunder it.\"\n\n\"What did you see under the stone?\"\n\n\"A silver tube, all wrought over with Persian patterns, and sealed at both\nends with a silver cap and lots o' wax.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you take it, you idiot?\"\n\n\"Two reasons.  Your Highness told me to report to you what I saw, not\nto take nothing.  And Mr. Blaine came to the top of the cellar ladder\nand was damned angry.  He'd have seen me if I'd pinched a cockroach.\nHe was that angry that he locked the cellar door afterward, and nailed\nit down, and rolled a safe on top of it!\"\n\n\"Did he suspect anything?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Your Highness.\"\n\n\"What did you tell him?\"\n\n\"Said I was looking for rum.\"\n\n\"Doubtless he believed that;  you have a reputation!  You are an idiot!\nIf you had brought away what you saw under that stone, you might have\ndrawn your pension today and left India for good!\"\n\nTom made no answer.  The next move was Gungadhura's.  There was\nsilence while a gold clock on the wall ticked off eighty seconds.\n\n\"You are an idiot!\" Gungadhura broke out at last.  \"You have missed\na golden opportunity!  But if you will hold your tongue--absolutely--you\nshall draw your pension in a month or two from now, with ten thousand\nrupees in gold into the bargain!\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Highness.\" (A native of the country would have begun to\ntry to bargain there and then.  But there are more differences than one\nbetween the ranks of East and West;  more degrees than one of\ndissimulation.  Tom gravely doubted Gungadhura's prospect of being\nin position to grant him a pension, or any other favor, a month or two\nfrom then.  A native of the country would have bargained nevertheless.\n\n\"Keep that guard confined for the present.  You have my leave to go.\"\n\nTom saluted and withdrew.  He was minded to spit on the palace steps,\nbut refrained because the guard would surely have reported what he\ndid to Gungadhura, who would have understood the act in its exact significance.\n\nAs he left the palace yard he passed a curtained two-wheeled cart\ndrawn by small humped bulls, and turned his head in time to see the\nhigh priest of Jinendra heave his bulk out from behind the curtains and\nwheezily ascend the palace steps.\n\n\"A little ghostly consolation for the maharajah's sins!\" he muttered, as\nhe headed toward his own quarters for another stiff glass of brandy\nand some sleep.  He felt he needed both--or all three!\n\n\"If it's true there's no hell, then I'm on velvet!\" he muttered.  \"But I'm\na liar!  A liar by imputation--by suggestion--by allegation--by collusion--\nand in fact!  Now, if I was one o' them Hindus I could hire a priest to\nsing a hymn and start me clean again from the beginning.  Trouble is,\nI'm a complacent liar!  I'll do it again, and I know it!  Brandy's the right\noracle for me!\"\n\nBut there was no consolation, ghostly or otherwise, being brought to\nGungadhura.  Jinendra's fat high priest, short-winded from his effort\non the stairs, with aching hams and knees that trembled from exertion,\nwas ushered into a chamber some way removed from that in which\nTom Tripe had had his interview. The maharajah lay now with his head\non the lap of Patali, his favorite dancing girl, in a room all scent and\ncushions and contrivances.  (That was how Yasmini learned about\nit afterward.)\n\nIt was against all the canons of caste and decency to accord an interview\nto any one in that flagrant state of impropriety--to a high priest especially.\nBut it amused Gungadhura to outrage the priest's alleged asceticism,\nand to show him discourtesy (without in the least affecting his own\nsuperstitious scruples in the matter of religion.)  Besides, his head ached,\nand he liked to have Patali's resourcefulness and wit to reenforce his\nown tired intuition.\n\nThe priest sat for several minutes recovering breath and equipoise.\nThen, when the pain had left his thighs and he felt comfortable, he\nbegan with a bomb.\n\n\"Mukhum Dass the money-lender has been to me to give thanks, and\nto make a meager offering for the recovery of his lost title-deed!  He\nhas it back!\"\n\nGungadhura swore so savagely that Patali screamed.\n\n\"How did he find it?  Where?\"\n\nMukhum Dass had told the exact truth, as it happened, but the priest\nhad drawn his own conclusions from the fact that it was Samson's babu\nwho returned the document.  He was less than ever sure of Gungadhura's\nprospects, suspecting, especially since his own night-interview with\nthe commissioner, that some new dark plot was being hatched on the\nEnglish side of the river.  Having no least objection to see Gungadhura\nin the toils, he did not propose to tell him more than would frighten and\nworry him.\n\n\"He said that a hand gave him the paper in the dark.  It was the work\nof Jinendra doubtless.\"\n\n\"Pah!  Thy god functions without thee, then!  That is a wondrous bellyful\nof brains of thine!  Do you know that the princess has fled the palace?\"\n\nJinendra's priest feigned surprise.\n\n\"Is it not as clear as the stupidity on thy fat face that the ten-times casteless\nhussy is behind this?  Bag of wind and widows' tenths!  Now I must buy\nthe house on the hill from Mukhum Dass and pay the brute his price for it!\"\n\n\"Borrowing the money from him first?\" the priest suggested with a fat smirk.\nNone guessed better than he how low debauch had brought the maharajah's\nprivate treasury.\n\n\"Go and pray!\" growled Gungadhura.  \"Are thy temple offices of no\nmore use than to bring thee here twitting me with poverty?  Go and lay\nthat belly on the flags, and beat thy stupid brains out on the altar step!\nJinendra will be glad to see thy dark soul on its way to Yum (the judge\nof the dead) and maybe will reward me afterward!  Go!  Get out here!\nLeave me alone to think!\"\n\nThe priest went through the form of blessing him, taking more than the\nusual time about the ceremony for sake of the annoyance that it gave.\nGungadhura was too superstitious to dare interrupt him.\n\n\"Better tell that Mukhum Dass to sell me the house cheap,\" said the\nmaharajah as a sort of afterthought.  Patali had been whispering to him.\n\"Tell him the gods would take it as an act of merit.\"\n\n\"Cheap?\" said the priest over his shoulder as he reached the door.\n\"I proposed it to him.\"  (That was not exactly true.  He had proposed\nthat Mukhum Dass should give the title to the temple as an act of grace.)\n\"He answered that what the gods have returned to him must be doubly\nprecious and certainly entrusted to his keeping;  therefore he would\ncount it a deadly sin to part with the title now on any terms!\"\n\n\"Go!\" growled Gungadhura.  \"Get out of here!\"\n\nAfter the priest had gone he talked matters over with Patali, while she\nstroked his aching head.  Whoever knows the mind of the Indian dancing\ngirl could reason out the calculus of treason.  They are capable of\ntreachery and loyalty to several sides at once;  of sale of their affections\nto the highest bidder, and of death beside the buyer in his last extremity,\nhaving sold his life to a rival whom they loathe.  They are the very\npriestesses of subterfuge--idolators of intrigue--past--mistresses of\nsedition and seduction.  Yet even Patali did not know the real reason\nwhy Gungadhura lusted for possession of that small house on the hill.\nShe believed it was for a house of pleasure for herself.\n\n\"Persuade the American gold-digger to transfer the lease of it,\" she\nsuggested.  \"He is thy servant.  He dare not refuse.\"\n\nBut Gungadhura had already enough experience of Richard Blaine to\nsuspect the American of limitless powers of refusal.  He was superstitious\nenough to believe in the alleged vision of Jinendra's priest, that the\nclue to the treasure of Sialpore would be found in the cellar of that house,\nwhere Jengal Singh had placed it;  impious enough to double-cross\nthe priest, and to use any means whatever, foul preferred, to get\npossession of the clue.  But he was sensible enough to know that\nDick Blaine could not be put out of his house by less than legal process.\nPatali, watching the expression of his eyes, mercurially changed her tactics.\n\n\"Today the court is closed,\" she said.  \"Tomorrow Mukhum Dass will\ngo to file his paper and defeat the suit of Dhulap Singh.  He will ride\nby way of the ghat between the temple of Siva and the place where\nthe dead Afghan kept his camels.  He must ride that way, for his home\nis on the edge of town.\"\n\nBut Gungadhura shook his head.  He hardly dared seize Mukhum Dass\nor have him robbed, because the money-lender was registered as a\nBritish subject, which gave him full right to be extortionate in any state\nhe pleased, with protection in case of interference.  He could rob\nDick Blaine with better prospect of impunity.  Suddenly he decided to\nthrow caution to the winds. Patali ceased from stroking his head, for\nshe recognized in his eyes the blaze of determination, and it put all\nher instincts on the defensive.\n\n\"Pen, ink and paper!\" he ordered.\n\nPatali brought them, and he addressed the envelope first, practising\nthe spelling and the none too easily accomplished English.\n\n\"Why to him?\" she asked, watching beside his shoulder.  \"If you send\nhim a letter he will think himself important.  Word of mouth--\"\n\n\"Silence, fool!  He would not come without a letter.\"\n\n\"Better to meet him, then, as if by accident and--\"\n\n\"There is no time!  That cursed daughter of my uncle is up to mischief.\nShe has fled.  Would that Yum had her!  She went to Samson days ago.\nThe English harass me.  She has made a bargain with the English to\nget the treasure first and ruin me.  I need what I need swiftly!\"\n\n\"Then the house is not for me?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\nHe wrote the letter, scratching it laboriously in a narrow Italian hand;\nthen sealed and sent it by a messenger.  But Patali, sure in her own\nmind that her second thoughts had been best and determined to have\nthe house for her own, went out to set spies to keep a very careful eye\non Mukhum Dass and to report the money-lender's movements to her\nhour by hour.\n\nIn less than an hour Dick Blaine arrived by dog-cart in answer to the\nnote, and Patali did her best to listen through a keyhole to the interview.\nBut she was caught in the act by Gungadhura's much neglected queen,\nand sent to another part of the palace with a string of unedifying titles\nringing in her ears.\n\nThere was not a great deal to hear.  Dick Blaine was perfectly satisfied\nto let the maharajah search his cellar.  He was almost suspiciously\ncomplaisant, making no objection whatever to surrendering the key\nand explaining at considerable length just how it would be easiest to\ndraw the nails.  He would be away from home all day, but Chamu the\nbutler would undoubtedly admit the maharajah and his men.  For the\nrest, he hoped they would find what they were looking for, whatever\nthat might be;  and he sincerely hoped that the maharajah had not hurt\nhis head seriously.\n\nAsked why he had nailed the cellar door down, he replied that he\nobjected to unauthorized people nosing about in there.\n\n\"Who has been in the cellar?\" asked Gungadhura.\n\n\"Only Tom Tripe.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Quite.  Until that very evening I always kept the cellar padlocked.  It's\na Yale lock.  There's nobody in this man's town could pick it.\"\n\n\"Well--thank you for the permission.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it.  I hope your head don't hurt you much.  Good morning.\"\n\nDick little suspected, as he drove the dog-cart across the bridge toward\nthe club, chuckling over the quick success of Yasmini's ruse, that he\nhimself had set the stage for tragedy.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Fifteen\n\n\n\n\nHe who sets a tiger-trap\n(Hush! and watch! and wait!)\nCan't afford a little nap\nHidden where the twigs enwrap\nLest--it has occurred--mayhap\nA jackal take the bait.\nSo stay awake, my sportsman bold,\nAnd peel your anxious eye,\nThere's more than tigers, so I'm told,\nTo test your cunning by!\n\n\n\"Me for the princess!\"\n\nIt is not always an entirely simple matter in India to dismiss domestic\nservants.  To begin with it was Sunday;  the ordinary means of cashing\nchecks were therefore unavailable, and Dick Blaine had overlooked\nthe fact that he had no money of small denominations in the house.\nIt was hardly reasonable to expect Chamu and the cook to leave without\ntheir wages.\n\nThen again, Sita Ram had not yet sent new servants to replace the\npotential poisoners;  and Chamu had put up a piteous bleating, using\nevery argument, from his being an orphan and the father of a son, down\nto the less appealing one that Gungadhura would be angry.  In vain\nDick reassured him that he and cook and maharajah might all go to hell\ntogether with his, Dick Blaine's, express permission.  In vain he advised\nhim to put the son to work, and be supported for a while in idleness.\nChamu lamented noisily.  Finally Dick compromised by letting both\nservants remain for one more day, reflecting that they could not very\nwell tamper with boiled eggs;  lunch and dinner he would get at the\nEnglish club across the river;  for breakfast on Monday he would content\nhimself again with boiled eggs, and biscuits out of an imported tin,\nafter which he would cash a check and send both the rascals packing.\n\nSo the toast that Chamu brought him he broke up and threw into the\ngarden, where the crows devoured it without apparent ill-effect;  he\nwent without tea, and spent an hour or so after breakfast with a good\ncigar and a copy of a month-old Nevada newspaper.  That religious\nrite performed, he shaved twice over, it being Sunday, and strolled out\nto look at the horses and potter about the garden that was beginning\nto shrivel up already at the commencement of the hot weather.\n\n\"If I knew who would be maharajah of this state from one week to the\nnext,\" he told himself, \"I'd get a contract from him to pipe water all over\nthe place from the hills behind.\"\n\nHe was sitting in the shade, chewing an unlit cigar, day-dreaming about\nwater-pressure and dams and gallons-per-hour, when Gungadhura's\nnote came and he ordered the dog-cart at once, rather glad of something\nto keep him occupied.  As he drove away he did not see Mukhum Dass\nlurking near the small gate, as it was not intended that he should.\nMukhum Dass, for his part, did not see Pinga, the one-eyed beggar\nwith his vertical smile, who watched him from behind a rock, for that\nwas not intended either.  Pinga himself was noticed closely by another man.\n\nThe minute Dick was out of sight Mukhum Dass entered the small gate\nin the wall, and called out for Chamu brazenly.  Chamu received him\nat the bottom\nof the house-steps, but Mukhum Dass walked up them uninvited.\n\n\"The cellar,\" he said. \"I have come to see the cellar.  There is a complaint\nregarding the foundations.  I must see.\"\n\n\"But, sahib, the door is locked.\"\n\n\"Unlock it.\"\n\n\"I have no key.\"\n\n\"Then break the lock!\"\n\n\"The cellar door is nailed down!\"\n\n\"Draw the nails!\"\n\n\"I dare not!  I don't know how!  By what right should I do this thing?\"\n\n\"It is my house.  I order it!\"\n\n\"But, sahib, only yesterday Blaine sahib dismissed me in great anger\nbecause I permitted another one as much as to look into the cellar!\"\n\nIf the tale Yasmini told him on the morning of her first visit to Tess\nhad not been enough to determine Mukhum Dass, now, with the lost\ntitle-deed recovered, the conviction that Gungadhura wanted the place\nfor secret reasons, and Chamu's objections to confirm the whole wild\nstory, he became as set on his course and determined to wring the\nlast anna out of the mystery as only a money-lender can be.\n\n\"With what money did you repay to me the loan that your son obtained\nby false pretenses?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I?  What?  I repaid the loan.  I have the receipt.  That is enough.\"\n\n\"On the receipt stands written the number of the bank-note.  I have kept\nthe bank-note.  It was stolen from the Princess Yasmini.  Do you wish\nto go to jail?  Then open that cellar door!\"\n\n\"Sahib, I never stole the note!\" wept Chamu.  \"It was thrust into my\ncummerbund from behind!\"\n\nBut Mukhum Dass set his face like a flint, and the wretched Chamu\nknew nothing about the law against compounding felonies.  Wishing\nhe had had curiosity enough himself to search the cellar thoroughly\nbefore the door was nailed down, he finally yielded to the money-lender's\nthreats and between them, with much sweating and grunting, they pushed\nand pulled the safe from off the trap.  Then came the much more difficult\ntask of drawing nails without an instrument designed for it.  Dick Blaine\nkept all his tools locked up.\n\n\"There is an outside door to the cellar, behind the house,\" said Chamu.\n\n\"But that is of iron, idiot! and bolts on the inside with a great bar resting\nin the stonework.  Are there no tools in the garden?\"\n\nChamu did not know, and the money-lender went himself to see.  There\nPinga with the vertical smile saw him choose a small crow-bar and return\ninto the house with it.  Pinga passed the word along to another man,\nwho told it to a third, who ran with it hot-foot to Gungadhura's palace.\n\nOnce inside the house again Mukhum Dass lost no time, arguing to\nhimself most likely that with the secret of the treasure of Sialpore in\nhis possession it would not much matter what damage he had done.\nHe would be able to settle for it.  He broke the hasp of the door, and\nlevered up the trap, splintering it badly and breaking both hinges in the\nprocess, while Chamu watched him, growing green with fear.\n\nThen he ordered a lamp and went alone into the cellar, while Chamu,\ndeciding that a desperate situation called for desperate remedies, went\nup-stairs on business of his own.  It took Mukhum Dass about two minutes\nto discover the loose stone--less than two more to raise it--and about\nten seconds to see and pounce on the silver tube.  He was too bent\non business to notice the man with the vertical smile peering down at\nhim through the trap.  Pinga escaped from the house after seeing the\nmoney-lender hide the tube inside his clothes, and less than a minute\nlater a lean man ran like the wind to Gungadhura's palace to confirm\nthe first's report.\n\nWith a wry face at the splintered trap-door, and a shrug of his shoulders\nof the kind he used when clients begged in tears for extra time in which\nto pay, Mukhum Dass looked about for Chamu with a sort of half-notion\nof giving him a small bribe.  But Chamu was not to be seen.  So he\nleft the house by the way he had come, mounted his mule where he\nhad left it in a hollow down the road, and rode off smiling.\n\nTen minutes later Chamu and the cook both left by the same exit.\nChamu had with him, besides his own bundle of belongings, a revolver\nbelonging to Dick Blaine, two bracelets belonging to Tess, a fountain-pen\nthat he had long had his heart on, plenty of note-paper on which to have\na writer forge new references, a half-dozen of Dick's silk handkerchiefs\nand a turquoise tie-pin.  The revolver alone, in that country in those days,\nwould sell for enough to take him to Bombay, where new jobs with newly\narrived sahibs are plentiful.  The cook, not having enjoyed the run of\nthe house, had only a few knives and a pound of cocoa.  They quarreled\nall the way down-hill as to why Chamu should and should not defray\nthe cook's traveling expenses.\n\nA little later, in the ghat between Siva's temple and the building, where\nthe dead Afghan used to keep his camels, Mukhum Dass, smiling as\nhe rode, was struck down by a knife-blow from behind and pitched\noff his mule head-foremost.  The mule ran away.  The money-lender's\nbody was left lying in a pool of blood, with the clothing torn from it;\nand it was considered by those who found the body several hours\nafterward and drove away the pariah dogs and kites, that the fact of\nhis money having been taken deprived the murder of any unusual interest.\n\nLate that evening Dick Blaine, returning from a desultory dinner at the\nclub across the river, very nearly fell into the trap-door, for the hamal\nhad run away too, thinking he would surely be accused of all the mischief,\nand no lamps were lit.\n\n\"Well!\" he remarked, striking a match to look about him, \"dad-blame\nme if that isn't a regular small town yegg's trick!  You'd think after I gave\nGungadhura the key and all, he'd have the courtesy to use it and draw\nthe nails!  His head can't ache enough to suit me!  Me for the princess!\nIf I'd any scruples, believe me, bo, they're vanished--gone--Vamoosed!\nThat young woman's going to win against the whole darned outfit, English,\nIndian and all!  Me for her!  Chamu!  Where's Chamu?  Why aren't the\nlamps lit?\"\n\nHe wandered through the house in the dark in search of servants, and\nfinally lit a lamp himself, locked all the doors and went to bed.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Sixteen\n\n\n\n\nThe buildings rear immense, horizons fade\nAnd thought forgets old gages in the ecstasy of view.\nThe standards go by which the steps were made.\nOn which we trod from former levels to the new.\nNo time for backward glance, no pause for breath,\nSince impulse like a bowstring loosed us in full flight\nAnd in delirium of speed none aim considereth\nNor in the blaze of burning codes can think of night.\nThe whirring of sped wheels and horn remind\nThat speed, more speed is best and peace is waste!\nThey rank unfortunate who tag behind\nAnd only they seem wise who urge, and haste and haste.\nNew comforts multiply (for there is need!)\nEach ballot adds assent to law that crowds the days.\nNone pause.  None clamor but for speed--more speed!\nAnd yet--there was a sweetness in the olden ways.\n\n\n\"And since, my Lords, in olden days--\"\n\nTrotters, fed on chopped raw meat by advice of Tess, and brushed\nby Bimbu for an hour to get the stiffness out of him, was sent off in the\nnoon heat with a double message for his master, one addressed to\nSamson, one to Dick Blaine, and both wrapped in the same chewed\nleather cover, that the dog might understand.  The mongrel in him made\nhim more immune to heat than a thoroughbred would have been.  In\nany case, he showed nothing but eagerness to get back to Tom Tripe,\nand, settling the package comfortably in his jaws, was off without ceremony\nat a steady canter.\n\n\"If all my friends were like that one,\" said Yasmini, \"I would be empress\nof the earth, not queen of a little part of Rajputana!  However, one thing\nat a time!\"\n\nIt was hardly more than a village that Tess could see through the jalousies\nof her bedroom windows.  The room was at a corner, so that she had\na wide view in two directions from either deep window-seat.  There\nwere all the signs of Indian village life about her--low, thatched houses\nin compounds fenced with thorn and prickly pear,--temples in between\nthem,--trades and handicrafts plied in the shade of ancient trees,--squalor\nand beauty, leisure, wealth, poverty and lordliness all hand in hand.\nShe could see the backs of elephants standing in a compound under\ntrees, and there were peacocks swaggering everywhere, eating the\nsame offal, though, as the unpretentious chickens in the streets.  Over\nin the distance, beyond the elephants, was the tiled roof of a great\nhouse glinting in strong sunlight between the green of enormous pipal\ntrees;  and there were other houses, strong to look at but not so great,\njumbled together in one quarter where a stream passed through the village.\n\nYasmini came and sat beside her in the window-seat, as simply dressed\nin white as on the night before, with her gold hair braided up loosely\nand an air of reveling in the luxury of peace and rest.\n\n\"That great house,\" she said, peering through the jalousies, \"is where\nthe ceremony is to be tonight.  My father's father built it.  This is not\nour state, but he owned the land.\"\n\n\"Doesn't it belong to Gungadhura now?\" Tess asked.\n\n\"No.  It was part of my legacy.  This house, too, that we are in.  Look,\nsome of them have come on elephants to do me honor.  Many of the\nnobles of the land are poor in these days;  one, they tell me, came on\nfoot, walking by night lest the ill-bred laugh at him.  He has a horse now.\nHe shall have ten when I am maharanee!\"\n\n\"Won't the English get to hear of this?\" Tess asked.\n\nYasmini laughed.\n\n\"Their spies are everywhere.  But there has been great talk of a polo\ntournament to be held on the English side of the river at Sialpore.  The\nEnglish encourage games, thinking they keep us Rajputs out of mischief--\nas indeed is true.  This, then, is a conference to decide which of our\nyoung bloods shall take part in the tournament, and who shall contribute\nponies.  The English lend one another ponies;  why not we?  The spies\nwill report great interest in the polo tournament, and the English will\nsmile complacently.\"\n\n\"But suppose a spy gets in to see the ceremony?\" Tess suggested.\n\nYasmini's blue eyes looked into hers and there was a Viking glare\nbehind them, suggestive of the wintry fjords whence one of her royal\nancestresses came.\n\n\"Let him!\" she said.  \"It would be the last of him!\"\n\nTess considered a while in silence.\n\n\"When is the tournament to be?\" she asked presently.  \"Won't the English\nthink it strange that the conference about men and ponies should be\nput off until so late?\"\n\n\"They might have,\" Yasmini answered.  \"They are suspicious of all\ngatherings.  But a month ago we worked up a dispute entirely for their\nbenefit.  This is supposed to be a last-hour effort to bring cohesion\nout of jealousy.  The English like to see Rajputs quarrel among themselves,\nbecause of their ancient saw that says 'Divide and govern!'  I do not\nunderstand the English altogether--yet;  but in some ways they are like\nan open book.  They will let us quarrel over polo to our heart's content.\"\n\nThere is something very close to luxury in following the thread of an\nintrigue, sitting on soft cushions with the sunlight sending layers of\ngolden shafts through jalousies into a cool room;  so little of the strain\nand danger of it;  so much of its engagement.  Tess was enjoying herself\nto the top of her bent.\n\n\"But when the ceremony is over,\" she said, \"and you yourself have\nproclaimed Prince Utirupa king of Sialpore, there will still remain the\nproblem of how to make the English recognize him.  There is Gungadhura,\nfor instance, to get out of the way;  and Gungadhura's sons--how many\nhas he?\"\n\n\"Five, all whole and well.  But the dogs must suffer for their breeding.\nWho takes a reverter's colt to school into a charger?  The English will\nturn their eyes away from Gungadhura's stock.\"\n\n\"But Gungadhura himself?\"\n\n\"Is in the toils already!  Say this for the English:  they are slow to reach\nconclusions--slower still to change their policy;  but when their mind is\nmade up they are swift!  Gungadhura has been sending messages to\nthe Northwest tribes.  How do I know?  You saw Ismail, my gateman?\nHis very brother took the letters back and forth!\"\n\n\"But why should Gungadhura risk his throne by anything so foolish?\"\n\n\"He thinks to save it.  He thinks to prove that the tribes began the dickering,\nand then to offer his army to the English--Tom Tripe and all!  Patali\nput him up to it.  Perhaps she wants a necklace made of Hill-men's teeth--\nwho knows?  Gungadhura went deeply into debt with Mukhum Dass,\nto send money to the Mahsudis, who think more of gold than promises.\nThe fool imagines that the English will let him levy, extra taxes afterward\nto recoup himself.  Besides, there would be the daily expenses of his\narmy, from which he could extract a lakh or two.  Patali yearns for\ndiamonds in the fillings of her teeth!\"\n\n\"Did you work out all this deep plot for yourself?\" Tess asked.\n\n\"I and the gods!  The gods of India love intrigue.  My father left me\nas a sort of ward of Jinendra, although my mother tried to make a Christian\nof me, and I always mistrusted Jinendra's priest.  But Jinendra has been\ngood.  He shall have two new temples when I am maharanee.\"\n\n\"And you have been looking for the treasure ever since your father died?\"\n\n\"Ever since.  My father prophesied on his death-bed that I should have\nit in the end, but all he told to help me find it was a sort of conundrum.\n'Whoever looks for flowers,' be said, 'finds happiness.  Who looks for\ngold finds all the harness and the teeth of war!  A hundred guard the\ntreasure day and night, changing with the full moon!'  So I have always\nlooked for flowers, and I am often happy.  I have sent flowers every\nday to the temple of Jinendra.\"\n\n\"Who or what can the hundred be, who guard the treasure day and night?\"\nTess wondered.\n\n\"That is what puzzled me.  At first, because I was very young, I thought\nthey must be snakes.  So I made friends with the snakes, learning how\nto handle even cobras without fear of them.  Then, when I had learned\nthat snakes could tell me nothing, but are only Widyadharas--beautiful\nlost fairies dreadfully afraid of men, and very, very wishful to be comforted,\nI began to think the hundred must be priests.  So I made friends with\nthe priests, and let them teach me all their knowledge.  But they know\nnothing!  They are parasites!  They teach only what will keep men in\ntheir power, and women in subjection, themselves not understanding\nwhat they teach!  I soon learned that if the priests were treasure-guards\ntheir charge would have been dissipated long ago!  Then I looked for\na hundred trees, and found them!  A hundred pipal trees all in a place\ntogether!  But that was only like the first goal in the very first chukker\nof the game--as you shall learn soon!\"\n\n\"Then surely I know!\" said Tess excitedly.  \"In the grounds of the palace\nacross the river, that you escaped from the night before you came to\nsee me, there is quite a little forest of pipals.\"\n\n\"Nine and sixty and the roots of four,\" Yasmini answered, her eyes\nglowing as if there were fire behind them.  \"The difficulty is, though,\nthat they don't change with the full moon!  Pipal trees grow on forever,\nnever changing, except to grow bigger and bigger.  They outlive centuries\nof men.  Nevertheless, they gave me the clue, not only to the treasure\nbut to the winning of it!\"\n\nThe afternoon wore on in drowsy quiet, both of the girls sleeping at\nintervals--waited on at intervals by Hasamurti with fruit and cooling drinks--\nYasmini silent oftener than not as the sun went lower, as if the details\nof what she had to do that night were rehearsing themselves in her mind.\nNo amount of questioning by Tess could make her speak of them again,\nor tell any more about the secret of the treasure.  At that age already\nshe knew too well the virtue and fun of unexpectedness.\n\nThey ate together very early, reclining at a low table heaped with more\nvarieties of food than Tess had dreamed that India could produce;\nbut ate sparingly because the weight of what was coming impressed\nthem both.  Hasamurti sang during the meal, ballad after ballad of the\nwarring history of Rajasthan and its royal heroines, accompanying herself\non a stringed instrument, and the ballads seemed to strike the right\nchord in Yasmini's heart, for when the meal finished she was queenly\nand alert, her blue eyes blazing.\n\nThen came the business of dressing, and two maids took Tess into\nher room to bathe and comb and scent and polish her, until she wondered\nhow the rest of the world got on without handmaidens, and laughed\nto think that one short week ago she had never had a personal attendant\nsince her nurse.  Swiftly the luxurious habit grows;  she rather hoped\nher husband might become rich enough to provide her a maid always!\n\nAnd after all that thought and trouble and attention she stood arrayed\nat last as no more than a maid herself--true, a maid of royalty;  but very\nsimply dressed, without a jewel, with plain light sandals on her stockinged\nfeet, and with a plain veil hanging to below her knees--all creamy white.\nShe admitted to herself that she looked beautiful in the long glass, and\nwished that Dick could see her so, not guessing how soon Dick would\nsee her far more gorgeously arrayed.\n\nYasmini, when she came into the room, was a picture to take the breath\naway,--a rhapsody in cream and amber, glittering with gems.  There\nwere diamonds sparkling on her girdle, bosom, ears, arms;  a ruby\nlike a prince's ransom nestled at her throat;  there were emeralds and\nsapphires stitched to the soft texture of her dress to glow and glitter\nas she moved;  and her hair was afire with points of diamond light.\nCoil on coil of huge pearls hung from her shoulders to her waist, and\npearls were on her sandals.\n\n\"Child, where in heaven's name did you get them all?\" Tess burst out.\n\n\"These?  These jewels?  Some are the gifts of Rajput noblemen.\nSome are heirlooms lent for the occasion.  This--and this\" she touched\nthe ruby at her throat and a diamond that glittered at her breast like\nfrozen dew-- \"he gave me.  He sent them by his brother, with an escort\nof eight gentlemen.  But you should wear jewels, too.\"\n\n\"I have none--none with me--\"\n\n\"I thought of that.  I borrowed these for you.\"\n\nWith her own hands she put opals around Tess's neck that glowed as\nif they were alive, and then bracelets on her right arm of heavy, graven\ngold;  then kissed her.\n\n\"You look lovely!  I shall need you tonight!  No other human guesses\nhow I need you!  You and Hasamurti are to stand close to me until the end.\nThe other maids will take their place behind us.  Now we are ready.  Come.\"\n\nOutside in the dark there were torches flaring, and low gruff voices\nannounced the presence of about fifty men.  Once or twice a stallion\nneighed;  and there was another footfall, padded and heavy, in among\nthe stamping of held horses.\n\nThe night was hot, and full of that musty mesmeric quality that changes\neverything into a waking dream.  The maids threw dark veils over them\nto save their clothing from the dust kicked up by a crowd, and perhaps,\ntoo, as a concession to the none-so-ancient, but compelling custom\nthat bids women be covered in the streets.\n\nYasmini took Tess by the hand and walked out with her, followed closely\nby Hasamurti and the other women, between the pomegranates to the\ngate in the garden wall.  From that moment, though, she stood alone\nand never touched hand, or sought as much as the supporting glances\nof her women until they came back at midnight.\n\nA watchman opened the gate and, Yasmini leading, they passed through\na double line of Rajput noblemen, who drew their sabers at some one's\nhoarse command and made a steel arch overhead that flashed and\nshimmered in the torchlight.  Beyond that one order to draw sabers\nnone spoke a word.  Tess looked straight in front of her, afraid to meet\nthe warrior eyes on either hand, lest some one should object to a\nforeigner in their midst on such a night of nights.\n\nIn the road were three great elephants standing in line with ladders\nleaning against them.  The one in front was a tusker with golden caps\nand chains on his glistening ivory, and a howdah on his back like a\nminiature pagoda--a great gray monster, old in the service of three\nRajput generations, and more conscious of his dignity than years.\nYasmini mounted him, followed by Tess and Hasamurti, who took their\nplace behind her in the howdah, one on either side, Hasamurti pushing\nTess into her proper place, after which her duty was to keep a royal\nfan of ostrich plumes gently moving in the air above Yasmini's head.\n\nThe other women climbed on to the elephant behind, and the third one\nwas mounted by one man, who looked like a prince, to judge by the\njewels glittering in his turban.\n\n\"His brother!\" Hasamurti whispered.\n\nThen again a hoarse command broke on the stillness.  Horses wheeled\nout from the shadow of the wall, led by saises, and the Rajput gentry\nmounted.  Ten of them in line abreast led the procession, while some\nformed a single line on either hand, and ten brought up the rear.  Men\nwith torches walked outside the lines.  But no one shouted.  No one spoke.\n\nStraight down the quiet road under the majestic trees, with the monkeys,\nfrightened by the torchlight, chattering nervously among the branches,--\nto the right near the lane Yasmini used the night before, and on toward\nthe shadowy bulk of the great house in the distance the elephant trod\nloftily, the swing and sway of his back suggesting ages of past history,\nand ever-lasting ages more to come.  The horses kicked and squealed,\nfor the Rajput loves a mettled mount;  but nothing disturbed the elephant's\nslow, measured stride, or moved the equanimity of his mahout.\n\nVillagers came to the walls, and stood under the roadside trees to smile\nand stare.  Every man and child salaamed low as the procession passed,\nand some followed in the dust to feast their curiosity until the end of it;\nbut not a voice was raised much above a whisper, except where once\nor twice a child cried shrilly.\n\n\"Why the silence?\" Tess asked in a whisper, and without turning her\nhead Yasmini answered:\n\n\"Would you have the English know that I was hailed as maharanee\nthrough the streets?  Give them but leave and they would beat the\ntomtoms, and dance under the trees.  These are all friends here.\"\n\nThe great house was surrounded by a high wall, but a gate was flung\nwide open to receive them and the procession never paused until the\nleading elephant came to a halt under a portico lit by dozens of oil lamps.\nStanding on the porch were four women, veiled, but showing the glint\nof jewels and the sheen of splendid dresses underneath;  they were\nthe first that night to give tongue in acclamation, raising a hub-bub of\ngreeting with a waving of slim hands and arms.  They clustered round\nYasmini as she climbed down from the elephant, and led her into the\nhall with arms in hers and a thousand phrases of congratulation and\nglad welcome.\n\n\"Four queens!\" Hasamurti whispered.\n\nTess and Hasamurti followed, side by side, not down the main hall,\nbut to the left, into a suite of rooms reserved for women, where they\nall removed their veils and the talking and laughter began anew.  There\nwere dozens of other women in there--about half as many ladies as\nattendants, and they made more noise than a swarm of Vassar freshmen\nat the close of term.\n\nThe largest of the suite of rooms was higher than the rest by half a\ndozen steps.  At its farther end was a gilded door, on either side of\nwhich, as far as the walls at each end, was a panel of very deeply carved\nwood, through the interstices of which every whisper in the durbar hall\nwas audible when the women all were still, and every man and movement\ncould be seen.  Yasmini took her stand close to the gilded door, and\nTess and Hasamurti watched the opportunity to come beside her--no\nvery easy matter in a room where fifty women jockeyed for recognition\nand a private word.\n\nBut there came a great noise of men's voices in the durbar hall, and\nof a roll-call answered one by one, each name being written in a vellum\nbook, that none might say afterward he was present, who was not, and\nnone might escape responsibility.  The women grew silent as a forest\nthat rustles and shivers in the night wind, and somebody turned down\nthe lights, so that it was easier to see through the carved panel, and\nnot so easy to be seen.  Immediately beyond the panel was a dais,\nor wide platform, bare of everything except a carpet that covered it\nfrom end to end.  A short flight of steps from the center of it led to the\ndurbar floor below.\n\nThe durbar floor was of polished teak, and all the columns that supported\nthe high roof were of the same wood, carved with fantastic patterns.\nFrom the center hung a huge glass chandelier, its quivering pendants\nmultiplying the light of a thousand candles;  and in every corner of the\nhall were other chandeliers, and mirrors to reflect the light in all directions.\n\nGrouped in the center of the hall were about two hundred men, all armed\nwith sabers,--men of every age, and height and swarthiness, from stout,\nblue-bearded veterans to youths yet in their teens,--dressed in every\nhue imaginable from the scarlet frock-coat, white breeches and high\nblack boots of a risaldar-major to the jeweled silken gala costume of\nthe dandiest of Rajput's youth.  There was not a man present who did\nnot rank himself the equal of all reigning kings, whatever outward deference\nthe exigency of alien overrule compelled. This was a race that, like the\nPoles, knew itself to have been conquered because  of subdivision\nand dissension in its ranks;  no lack of courage or of martial skill had\nbrought on their subjection.  Not nearly all their best were there that night--\nnot even any of the highest-placed, because of jealousy and the dread\nof betrayal;  but there was not a priest among them, so that the chance\nwas high that their trust would be well kept.\n\nThese were the pick of Rajputana's patriots--the men who loved the\nold ways, yet admitted there was virtue in an adaptation of the new.\nAnd Yasmini, with a gift for reading men's hearts that has been her\nsecret and her source of power first and last, was reviving an ancient\nroyal custom for them, to the end that she might lead them in altogether\nnew ways of her own devising.\n\nThe roll-call ended, a veteran with a jeweled aigrette in his turban stood\napart from the rest with his back toward the dais steps and made a\nspeech that was received in silence, though the women peering through\nthe panel, fluttered with excitement, and the deep breathing in the durbar\nhall sounded like the very far-off murmur of a tide.  For he rang the\nchanges on the ancient chivalry of Rajasthan, and on the sanctity of\nancient custom, and the right they had to follow what their hearts\naccounted good.\n\n\"And as in ancient days,\" he said, \"our royal women chose their husbands\nat a durbar summoned by the king;  and because in ancient times,\nwhen Rajasthan was a land of kings indeed and its royal women, as\nthe endless pages of our history tell, stood proved and acclaimed as\nfit to govern, and defend, and die untarnished in the absence of their\nlords;  therefore we now see fit to attend this durbar, and to witness\nand give sanction.  Once again, my Lords, a royal daughter of a throne\nof Rajasthan shall choose her husband in the sight of all of us let come\nof it what may!\"\n\nHe ceased, and the crowd burst into cheers.  Yasmini translated his\nspeech afterward to Tess.  He said not a word of Gungadhura, or of\nthe throne of Sialpore, leaving that act of utter daring to the woman who\nwas, after all, the leader of them all that night.\n\nNow all eyes were on the dais and the door behind it.  In the inner room\nthe women stirred and whispered, while a dozen of them, putting on\ntheir veils again, gathered around Yasmini, waiting in silence for her to\ngive the cue.  She waited long enough to whet the edge of expectation,\nand then nodded.  Hasamurti opened the door wide and Yasmini stepped\nforth, aglitter with her jewels.\n\n\"Ah-h-h!\" was her greeting--the unbidden, irrepressible, astonished gasp\nof mixed emotion of a crowd that sees more wonder than it bargained for.\n\nThe twelve princesses took their place beside her on the dais, six on\neither side.  Immediately behind her Tess and Hasamurti stood.  Yasmini's\nother maids arranged themselves with their backs to the gilded door.\nShe, Tess and Hasamurti were the only women there unveiled.\n\nShe stood two minutes long in silence, smiling down at them while Tess's\nheart-beats drummed until she lost count, Tess suspecting nervousness\nbecause of her own nerves, and not so wildly wrong.\n\n\"You're not alone,\" she whispered.  \"You've a friend behind you--two friends!\"\n\nThen Yasmini spoke.\n\n\"My Lords.\"  The word \"Bahadur\" rolled from her golden throat like chords\nof Beethoven's overture to Leonori.  \"You do our olden customs honor.\nTrue chivalry had nearly died since superstition and the ebb and flow\nof mutual mistrust began to smother it in modern practises.  But neither\npriest nor alien could make it shame for maidenhood to choose which\nway its utmost honor lies.  Ye know your hearts' delight.  Goodness, love\nand soundless fealty are the attributes your manhood hungers for.\nOf those three elements is womanhood.  And so, as Shri--goddess of\nall good fortune--comes ever to her loved one of her own accord and\ndowers him with richer blessing than he dreamed, true womanhood\nshould choose her mate and, having chosen, honor him.  My Lords,\nI choose, in confidence of your nobility and chivalry!\"\n\nPausing for a minute then, to let the murmur of assent die down, and\nwaiting while they stamped and shuffled into three long lines, she\ndescended the steps alone, moving with a step so dignified, yet modest,\nthat no memory of past events could persuade Tess it was artistry.\nShe felt--Tess was sure of it, and swore to it afterward--in her heart of\nhearts the full spiritual and profound significance of what she did.\n\nBeginning at the left end of the first line, she passed slowly and alone\nbefore them, looking each man in the eyes, smiling at each one as she\npassed him.  Not a man but had his full meed of attention and the honor\ndue to him who brings the spirit of observance and the will to help another\nman succeed.\n\nBack along the second line she went, with the same supreme dignity\nand modesty, omitting not even the oldest veteran, nor letting creep\ninto her smile the veriest suggestion of another sentiment than admiration\nfor the manliness by whose leave she was doing what she did.  Each\nman received his smile of recognition and the deference due his pride.\n\nThen down the third line, yet more slowly, until Tess had cold chills,\nthinking Utirupa was not there!  One by one she viewed them all, until\nthe last man's turn came, and she took him by the hand and led him forth.\n\nAt that the whole assembly milled into a mob and reformed in double\nline up and down the room.  The same voice that had thundered in the\ndarkness roared again and two hundred swords leapt from their scabbards.\nUnder an arch of blazing steel, in silence, Yasmini and her chosen\nhusband came to the dais and stood facing the assembly hand in hand,\nwhile the swords went back to their owners' sides and once more the\ncrowd clustered in the center of the hall.\n\nThere was a movement in among them then.  Some servants brought\nin baskets, and distributed them at about equal intervals amid the forest\nof booted legs.  When the servants had left the hall, Yasmini spoke.\n\n\"My Lords, in the presence of you all I vow love, honor, fealty and a\nwife's devotion to the prince of my choosing--to my husband who shall be--\nwho now is by Gandharva ceremony;  for I went to him of my own free\nwill by night!  My Lords, I present to you--\"\n\nThere was a pause, while every man present caught his breath, and\nthe women rustled like a dove-cot behind the panel.\n\n\"--Gunga Khatiawara Dhuleep Rhakapushi Utirupa Singh--Maharajah\nof Sialpore!\"\n\nTwo hundred swords sprang clear again.  The chandeliers rattled and\nthe beams shook to the thunder of two hundred throats.\n\n\"Rung Ho!\" they roared.\n\n\"Rung Ho!\"\n\n\"Rung Ho!\" bringing down their right feet with a stamp all together that\nshook the building.\n\nThen the baskets were cut open by the swords' points and they flung\nflowers at the dais, swamping it in jasmine and sweet-smelling buds,\nuntil the carpet was not visible.  The same black-bearded veteran who\nhad spoken first mounted the dais and hung garlands on Yasmini and\nher prince, and again the hall shook to the roar of acclamation and the\nsharp ringing of keen steel.\n\nBut Yasmini had not finished all she had to say.  When the shouting\ndied and the blades returned to scabbards, her voice again stirred their\nemotions, strangely quiet and yet reaching all ears with equal resonance,\nlike the note of a hidden bell.\n\n\"And since, my Lords, in olden days it happened often that a Rajput\nwoman held and buttressed up her husband's throne, honoring him\nand Rajputana with her courage and her wit, and daring even in the arts\nof war, so now:  this prince shall have his throne by woman's wit.  Before\nanother full moon rises he shall sit throned in the palace of his ancestors;\nand ye who love royal Rajasthan shall answer whether I chose wisely,\nin the days to come!\"\n\nThey answered then and there to the utmost of their lungs.  And while\nthe hall resounded to the crash and clangor of applause she let go\nUtirupa's hand, bowed low to him, and vanished through the gilded\ndoor in the midst of her attendant women.\n\nFor two hours after that she was the center of a vortex of congratulation--\nquestions--whisperings--laughter and advice, while the women flocked\nabout her and she introduced Tess to them one by one.  Tess, hardly\nunderstanding a word of what was said to her, was never made so much\nof in her life, sharing honors with Yasmini, almost as much a novelty\nas she--a Western woman, spirited behind the purdah by the same\nnew alchemy that made a girl of partly foreign birth, and so without\ncaste in the Hindu sense of it, revive a royal custom with its antecedents\nrooted in the very rocks of time.  It was a night of breathless novelty.\n\nThere were the inevitable sweetmeats--the inevitable sugared drinks.\nThen the elephants again, and torches under the mysterious trees, with\na sabered escort plunging to the right and left.  The same torch-lit faces\npeering from the village doors and walls;  and at last the gate again in\nthe garden wall, and a bolt shot home, and silence.  Then:\n\n\"Did I do well?\" Yasmini asked, leaning at last on Tess.  \"Oh, my sister!\nWithout you there to lend me courage I had failed!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Seventeen\n\n\n\n\nHow about the door!  Did somebody lock it?\n\"I,\" said the Chairman, \"had the key in my pocket.\"\nWho shut the windows? \"I,\" said the vice.\n\"I shut the window, it seemed to me wise.\"\n\"I,\" said the clerk, \"looked under the table\nAnd out on the balcony under the gable.\"\nThen who let the secret out?  Who overheard?\nMaybe a mouse, or the flies, or a bird!\n\n\n\"Suppose I lock the door?\"\n\nTom Tripe felt like a new man, and his whiskers crackled with self-\nsatisfaction.  For one thing, his dog Trotters was back again--sore-footed,\nit was true, and unable at present to follow him on his rounds;  and rather\nbadly scratched where a leopard must have missed his spring on the\nmoonlit desert;  but asleep in the stable litter, on the highroad to recovery.\n\nTom had ridden that morning, first to Dick Blaine up at the gold mine,\nbecause he was a friend and needed good news of his wife;  then across\nthe bridge to Samson, straightening out the crumpled letter from Yasmini\nas he rode, and chuckling to himself at the thought of mystifying the\ncommissioner.  And it all worked out the way he hoped, even to the offer\nof a drink--good brandy--Hennesey's Three Star.\n\n\"How did you manage it?\" asked Samson.  \"The princess has disappeared.\nThere's a rumor she's over the border in the next state.  Gungadhura\nhas seized her palace and rifled it.  How did you get my letter to her,\nand her answer so swiftly?\"\n\n\"Ah, sir,\" said Tom Tripe mischievously, \"we in the native service have\nour little compensations--our little ways and means!\"\n\nThat was better than frankincense and myrrh, to mystify a genuine\ncommissioner!  Tom rode back to his quarters turning over the taste\nof brandy in his mouth--he had made a martial raid on Samson's tantalus--\nand all aglow with good humor.\n\nNot so Samson.  The commissioner was irritable, and more so now\nthat he opened the scented letter Tom had brought.  It was deuced curt,\nit seemed to him, and veiled a sort of suggested laughter, if there was\nanything insinuative in polite phrases.\n\n\"The Princess Yasmini Omanoff Singh,\" it ran, \"hastens to return thanks\nfor Sir Roland Samson's kind letter.  She is not, however, afraid of\nimprisonment or of undue pressure;  and as for her secret, that is safe\nas long as the river runs through the state of Sialpore.\"\n\nNot a word more.  He frowned at the letter, and read and reread it, sniffing\nat the scent and holding up the paper to the light, so that Sita Ram very\nnearly had a chance to read it through the knot-hole in the door.  The\nlast phrase was the puzzler.  It read at first like a boast--like one of those\npicturesque expressions with which the Eastern mind enjoys to overstate\nits case.  But he reflected on it.  As an Orientalist of admitted distinction\nhe had long ago concluded that hyperbole in the East is always based\non some fact hidden in the user's mind, often without the user's knowledge.\nHe had written a paper on that very subject, which the Spectator printed\nwith favorable editorial comment;  and Mendelsohn K. C. had written\nhim a very agreeable letter stating that his own experience in criminal\ncases amply bore out the theory.  He rang the desk bell for Sita Ram.\n\n\"Get me the map of the province.\"\n\nSita Ram held it by two corners under the draughty punkah while Samson\ntraced the boundaries with his finger.  It was exactly as he thought:\nwithout that little palace and its grounds, the state of Sialpore would be\nbounded exactly by the river.  Take away the so-called River Palace\nwith the broad acres surrounding it, and the river would no longer run\nthrough the state of Sialpore.  That would be the end, then, of the safety\nof the secret.  There was food for reflection there.\n\nWhat if the famous treasure of Sialpore were buried somewhere in the\ngrounds of the River Palace!  Somewhere, for instance, among those\ngigantic pipal trees.\n\nHe folded the map and returned it to Sita Ram.\n\n\"I'm expecting half a dozen officers presently.  Show them in the minute\nthey come.  And--ah--you'd better lock that middle door.\"\n\nSita Ram dutifully locked the door on Samson's side, and drew the\ncurtain over it.  There was a small hole in the curtain, of peculiar shape--\nmoths had been the verdict when Samson first noticed it, and Sita Ram\nhad advised him to indent for some preventive of the pests;  which\nSamson did, and the hole did not grow any greater afterward.\n\nSamson had had to call a conference, much though he disliked doing it.\nThe rules for procedure in the case of native states included the provision\nof an official known as resident, whose duty was to live near the native ruler--\nand keep a sharp eye on him.  But Samson, prince of indiscretion, had\nseen fit three months before to let that official go home to England on\nlong leave, and to volunteer the double duty in his absence.  The proposal\nhaving economic value, and there being no known trouble in Sialpore\njust then, the State Department had consented.\n\nThe worst of that was that there was no one now in actual close touch\nwith Gungadhura.  The best of it was that there was none to share the\nknowledge of Samson's underlying scheme--which was after all nothing\nbut to win high laurels for himself, by somewhat devious ways, perhaps,\nbut justified in his opinion in the circumstances.  And the very worst\nof it was that good form and official precedent obliged him to call a\nconference before recommending certain drastic action to his government.\nHaving no official resident to consult, he had to go through the form of\nconsulting somebody;  and the more he called in, the less likelihood\nthere was of any one man arrogating undue credit to himself.\n\nThey were ushered in presently by Sita Ram.  Ross, the principal medical\nofficer came first;  it was a pity he ranked so high that he could not be\noverlooked, but there you were.  Then came Sir Hookum Bannerjee,\njudge of the circuit court--likely to have a lot to say without much meaning\nin it, and certainly anxious to please.  Next after him Sita Ram showed\nin Norwood, superintendent of police;  one disliked calling in policemen,\nthey were so interfering and tactless, but Norwood had his rights.  Then\ncame Topham, acting assistant to Samson, loaned from another state\nto replace young Wilkinson, home on sick leave, and full-back on the\npolo team--a quiet man as a rule, anxious to get back to his own district,\nand probably reasonably safe.  Last came Lieutenant-Colonel Willoughby\nde Wing--small, brusk and florid--acting in command of the 88th Sikh\nLancers, and preferring that to any other task this side of heaven or hell;--\n\"Nothing to do with politics, my boy,--not built that way--don't like 'em--\nnever understood 'em anyhow.  Soldiering's my business.\"\n\nIt was well understood it was to be a secret conference.  The invitations\nhad been marked \"Secret.\"\n\n\"Suppose I lock the door,\" suggested Samson by way of additional\nreminder;  and he did that, resuming his chair with an expression that\npermitted just the least suggestion of a serious situation to escape him.\nBut he was smiling amiably, and his curled mustache did not disguise\nthe corners of a wilful mouth.\n\n\"There is proof conclusive,\" he began, \"--I've telegrams here that you\nmay see in confidence, that Gungadhura has been trafficking with\nNorthwest tribes.  He has sent them money, and made them promises.\nThere isn't a shade of doubt of it.  The evidence is black.  The question is,\nwhat's to be done?\"\n\nThey passed the telegrams from hand to hand, Norwood looking rather\nsupercilious.  (The police could handle espionage of that sort so much\nbetter.)  But it was the youngest man's place to speak first.\n\n\"Depose him, I suppose, and put his young son in his place,\" suggested\nTopham.  \"There's plenty of precedent.\"\n\nThe doctor shook his head.\n\n\"I know Gungadhura.  He's a bad strain.  It's physiological.  I've made\na study of these things, and I'm as certain as that I sit here that any son\nof Gungadhura's would eventually show the same traits as his sire.\nIf you can get rid of Gungadhura, get rid of his whole connection by\nall means.\"\n\n\"What should be done with the sons, then?\" asked Sir Hookum Bannerjee,\nfather of half a dozen budding lawyers.\n\n\"Oh, send 'em to school in England, I suppose,\" said Samson.  \"There's\nprecedent for that too.  But there's another point.  Mukhum Dass the\nmoney-lender has been foully murdered, struck down by a knife from\nbehind by some one who relieved him of his money.  Either a case of\nsimply robbery, or else--\"\n\n\"Or else what?\" Colonel Willoughby de Wing screwed home his monocle.\n\n\"That's as obvious as twice two.  That rascal Mukhum Dass was bound\nto die violently sooner or later.  He was notoriously the worst usurer\nand title-jumper on this side of India.  He charged me once a total of\neighty-five per cent. for a small loan--and legally, too;  kept within the law!\nI know him!\"\n\n\"On the other hand,\" said Samson, \"I've been informed that the cellar\nof the house at present occupied by those Americans on the hill--the\ngold-miner, you know--Blaine--was burgled last Sunday morning.  Blaine\nhimself complained to me.  It seems that he had given Gungadhura\nleave to search the cellar, at Gungadhura's request, for what purpose\nBlaine professes not to know.  Blaine himself, you may remember, lunched\nand dined at the club last Sunday and gave three of us a rather costly\nlesson in his national game of poker.  It took place while he was with\nus at the club.  He has been able to discover, by cross-examining some\nwitnesses--beggars, I believe, who haunt the house,--that Mukhum Dass\ngot to the place ahead of Gungadhura, burgled the cellar, removed\nsomething of great value to Gungadhura, and went off with it.  On the\nway home he was murdered.\"\n\n\"The murder of Mukhum Dass was known very soon afterward, of course,\nto the police,\" said Norwood. \"But we can't do anything across the river\nwithout orders.  Why didn't Mr. Blaine bring his complaint and evidence\nto me?\"\n\n\"Because I asked him not to!\" answered Samson.  \"We're mixed up\nhere in a political case.\"\n\n\"Damn all politics!\" growled Willoughby de Wing.\n\n\"If it can be proved that Gungadhura murdered Mukhum Dass, or caused\nhim to be murdered, I should say arrest him, try the brute and hang him!\"\nsaid Topham.  \"Confound these native princes that take law into their\nown hands!\"\n\n\"I should say, let's prove the case if we can,\" said Samson, \"and use\nthat for an extra argument to force Gungadhura's abdication.  No need\nto hang him.  If he'd killed a princess, or an Englishman, we'd be obliged\nto take extreme measures;  but, as De Wing says, Mukhum Dass was\nan awful undesirable.  If we hanged Gungadhura, we'd almost have to\nput one of his five sons on the throne to succeed him.  If be abdicates,\nwe can please ourselves.  I think I can persuade him to abdicate--if\nNorwood, for instance, knows of any way to gather secret evidence\nabout that murder--secret, you understand me, Norwood.  We need\nthat for a sword of Damocles.\"\n\n\"Who's to succeed him in that case?\" asked Ross, the P. M. O.\n\n\"I shall recommend Utirupa Singh,\" said Samson, with his eyes alert.\n\nRoss nodded.\n\n\"Utirupa is one of those men who make me think the Rajput race is not\nmoribund.\"\n\n\"A good clean sportsman!\" said Topham.  \"Plays a red-hot game of\npolo, too!\"\n\n\"Pays up his bets, moreover, like a gentleman!\" said Colonel Willoughby\nde Wing.\n\n\"I feel sure,\" said Sir Hookum Bannerjee, seeing be was expected to\nsay something, \"that Prince Utirupa Singh would be acceptable to the\nRajputs themselves, who are long weary of Gungadhura's way.  But\nhe is not married.  It is a pity always that a reigning prince should be\nunmarried;  there are so many opportunities in that case for intrigue,\nand for mistakes.\"\n\n\"Gad!\" exclaimed Willoughby de Wing, dropping his monocle.  \"What\na chance to marry him to that young Princess Whatshername--you know\nthe one I mean--the one that's said to masquerade in men's clothes\nand dance like the devil, and all that kind of thing.  I know nothing of\npolitics, but--what a chance!\"\n\n\"God forbid!\" laughed Samson.  \"That young woman is altogether too\ncapable of trouble without a throne to play with!  I suspect her, as it\nhappens, of very definite and dangerous intentions along another line\nconnected with the throne of Sialpore.  But I know how to disappoint\nher and stop her game.  I intend to recommend--for the second time,\nby the way--that she, also, should be sent to Europe for a proper education!\nBut the point I'm driving at is this:  are we agreed as to the proper course\nto take with Gungadhura?\"\n\nThey nodded.\n\n\"Then, as I see it, there's no desperate hurry.  Norwood will need time\nto gather evidence;  I'll need specific facts, not hearsay, to ram down\nGungadhura's throat.  I'll send a wire to the high commissioner and\nanother to Simla, embodying what we recommend, and--what do you\nsay to sending for a battery or two?\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Willoughby de Wing.  \"A very good thought indeed!  I\nknow nothing of politics, except this;  that there's nothing like guns to\noverawe the native mind and convince him that the game's up!  Let's see--\nwho'd come with the guns?  Coburn, wouldn't he?  Yes, Coburn.  He's\nmy junior in the service.  Yes, a very good notion indeed.  Ask for two\nbatteries by all means.\"\n\n\"I'll tell them not to hurry,\" said Samson.  \"It's hot weather.  They can\nmake it in easy stages.\"\n\n\"By jove!\" said Topham.  \"They'll be here in time for the polo.  Won't\nthey beef!\"\n\n\"Talking of polo, who's to captain the other side?  Is it known yet?\" asked\nDe Wing.\n\n\"Utirupa,\" answered Topham.  \"There was never any doubt of that.\nWe've got Collins to captain us, and Latham and Cartwright, besides me.\nWe'll give him the game of his life!\"\n\n\"That settles quite an important point,\" said Samson.  \"The polo tournament--\nafter it, rather--is the time to talk to Utirupa.  If we keep quiet until then--\nall of us, I mean--there'll be no chance of the cat jumping before the State\nDepartment pulls the string.  I feel sure, from inside information, that\nHeadquarters would like nothing known about this coup d'etat until it's\nconsummated.  Explanations afterward, and the fewer the better!  Have\na drink anybody?\"\n\nIn the outer office beyond the curtain Sita Ram cautiously refitted the\nknot into its hole, and sat down to write hurriedly while details were fresh\nin mind.  Ten minutes afterward, when the conference had broken up\nin small-talk, he asked permission to absent himself for an hour or two.\nHe said he had a debt to pay across the river, to a man whose wife was ill.\n\nOne hour and a half later by Sita Ram's wrist watch, Ismail, an Afridi\ngate-keeper at present apparently without a job, started off on a racing\ncamel full-pelt for the border, with a letter in his pocket addressed to\na merchant by way of ostensible business, and ten rupees for solace\nto the Desert Police.  Tucked away in the ample folds of his turban\nwas a letter to Yasmini, giving Sita Ram's accurate account of what\nhad happened at the secret conference.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Eighteen\n\n\n\n\nSafe rules for defeating a rascal are three,\nAnd the first of them all is appear to agree.\nThe second is boggle at points that don't matter,\nHold out for expense and emolument fatter.\nThe third is put wish-to-seem-wise on the shelf\nAnd keep your eventual plan to yourself.\nGiving heed to the three with your voice and eyes level\nYou can turn the last trick by out-trumping the devil.\n\n\n\"Be discreet, Blaine--please be discreet!\"\n\nMeanwhile, Gungadhura was not inactive, nor without spies of his own,\nwho told him more or less vaguely that trouble was cooking for him in\nthe English camp.  A letter he expected from the Mahsudi tribe had\nnot reached him.  It was the very letter he had hoped to show to Samson\nin proof of Mahsudi villainy and his own friendship;  but he rather feared\nit had fallen into secret service hands, in which case he might have a\nhard time to clear himself.\n\nThen there was the murder of Mukhum Dass.  He had not been able\nto resist that opportunity, when Patali reported to him what Mukhum\nDass had been seen to make away with.  And now he had the secret\nof the treasure in his possession--implicit directions, and a map!  He\nsuspected they had been written by some old priest, or former rajah's\nservant, in the hope of a chance for treachery, and hidden away by\nJengal Singh with the same object.  There were notes on the margins\nby Jengal Singh.  The thing was obviously genuine. But the worst of\nit was Patali knew all about it now, and that cursed idiot Blaine had\ncomplained to Samson of burglary, after he learned that the cellar door\nwas broken open by the money-lender.  Why hadn't he come to himself,\nhe wondered, and been satisfied with a string of promises?  That would\nhave been the courteous thing to do.  Instead of that, now Samson's\nspies were nosing about, and only the gods knew what they might\ndiscover.  The man who had done the murder was safely out of the way--\nprobably in Delhi by that time, or on his way there;  but that interfering\nass Norwood might be awake for once, and if the murderer should\nhappen to get caught, and should confess--as hired murderers do\nsometimes--it would need an awful lot of expert lying and money, too,\nto clear himself.\n\nWith funds--ample extravagant supplies of ready cash, he felt he could\neven negotiate the awkward circumstance that he himself was deeply\nin debt to Mukhum Dass at the time of the murder.  Money and brains\ncombined can accomplish practically anything.  Delhi and Bombay and\nCalcutta were full of clever lawyers.  The point was, he must hurry.\nAnd he did not dare trust any one with knowledge of his secret, except\nPatali, who had wormed out some and guessed the rest, because of\nthe obvious risk of Samson getting wind of it through spies and so\nforestalling him.  He felt he had Samson's character estimated nicely.\n\nArguing with himself--distracted between fear on one hand, and Patali's\nimportunity on the other, he reached the conclusion that Dick Blaine\nwas his only safe reliance.  The American seemed to have an obsession\nfor written contracts, and for enforcing the last letter of them.  Well and\ngood, he would make another contract with Dick Blaine, and told Patali\nso, she agreeing that the American was the safest tool to use.  She\nsaw herself already with her arms up to the shoulders in the treasure\nof Sialpore.\n\n\"The American has few friends,\" she said.  \"He smokes a pipe, and\nthinks, and now that they say his wife has gone away there is less chance\nthan ever of his talking.\"\n\n\"He will need to be paid,\" said Gungadhura.\n\n\"There will be plenty to pay him with!\" she answered, her eyes gleaming.\n\nSo Gungadhura, with his face still heavily bandaged, drove in a lumbering\nclosed carriage up the rough track to the tunnel Dick had blasted in the\nhill-side.  The carriage could not go close to the tunnel-mouth, because\nthe track was only wide enough just there for the dump-carts to come\nand go.  So he got out and walked into the tunnel unattended.  Dick\nwas used to seeing him about the works in any case and never objected\nto explaining things, several times over on occasion.\n\nHe found Dick superintending the careful erection of a wall of rock and\ncement, and he thought for an instant that the American looked annoyed\nto see him there.  But Dick assumed his poker expression the moment\nafterward, and you couldn't have guessed whether he was glad or sorry.\n\n\"You block the tunnel?\" the maharajah asked.\n\n\"The vein's disappeared,\" said Dick.  \"The rock's all faulty here this\nand that way. I'm shoring up the end to keep the roof from falling down\non us, and next I'm going to turn sharp at right angles and try to find\nthe end of the vein where it broke off.\"\n\n\"You are too near the fort in any case,\" said the maharajah. \"No use\ndriving under the fort.\"\n\n\"What do you propose I should do?\" Dick answered a trifle testily.\n\n\"Dig elsewhere.\"\n\n\"What, and scrap this outlay?\"\n\n\"Yes. I have a reason.  A particular--eh--reason.\"\n\nDick nodded, poker face set solid.\n\nThe maharajah paused.  His advantage was that his face was all\nsmothered in the bandages, and the dim light in the tunnel was another\ngood ally.  His back, too, was toward the entrance, so that the American's\nchance of reading between the words was remarkably slight.  Dick's\nback was against the uncompleted masonry.\n\n\"Could I--eh--count on you for--eh--very absolute silence?\"\n\n\"I talk like that parrot in the story,\" Dick answered.\n\n\"You--eh--know a little now of Sialpore, Mr. Blaine.  You--eh--understand\nhow easily--eh--rumors get about.  A little--eh--foundation and--eh--\nup-side-down pyramids of fancy--eh?  You comprehend me?\"\n\n\"Sure, I get you.\"\n\n\"Eh--you have a good working party.\"\n\n\"Fine!\" said Dick.  \"Just about broke in.  Got the gang working pretty\nwell to rights at last.\"\n\n\"Would you--eh--it would take a long time to get such another party\nof laborers--eh--trained to work well and swiftly?\"\n\n\"Months!\" said Dick.  \"Unless you've got tame wizards up your sleeve.\"\n\n\"Eh--I was wondering--eh--whether you would be content to--eh--take\nyour working party and--eh--do a little work for me elsewhere?\"\n\n\"I'm right set on puzzling out this fault in the reef,\" Dick answered promptly.\n\"My contract reads--\"\n\n\"For compensation, of course,\" said Gungadhura.  \"You would be\nadequately--eh--there could be a contract drawn.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't cancel this one--not for hard cash,\" Dick retorted.\n\n\"No, no.  I do not ask that.  It would--eh--not be necessary.\"\n\n\"Well, then, what's the proposal?\"\n\nDick settled himself back against the masonry crossed his feet, and\nknocked out ashes from his pipe.  The maharajah walked twice, ten\nyards toward the entrance and back again.\n\n\"How long would it take you--eh--to--eh--what was it you said?--to puzzle\nout this fault?\"\n\n\"No knowing.\"\n\n\"A short--eh--additional delay will hardly matter?\"\n\n\"Not if I kept the gang in harness.  'Twouldn't pay to let the team-work\nslide.  Costs too much in time and trouble to break 'em in again.\"\n\n\"Then--eh--will you go and dig for me elsewhere?\"\n\n\"On what terms?\"\n\n\"The same terms.\"\n\n\"You pay all expenses and--what am I to dig for?\"\n\n\"Gold!\"\n\n\"Do I get my percentage of the gross of all gold won?\"\n\n\"Yes.  But because this is a certainty and--eh--I pay all expenses--eh--\nof course, in--eh--return for secrecy you--eh--should be well paid, but--\neh--a certain stated sum should be sufficient, or a much smaller percentage.\"\n\n\"Suppose we get down to figures?\" Dick suggested.\n\n\"Fifty thousand rupees, or one per cent.\"\n\n\"At my option?\"\n\nGungadhura nodded.  Dick whistled.\n\n\"There'd have to be a time limit.  I can't stay and dig forever for a matter\nof fifty thousand dibs.\"\n\nGungadhura grew emphatic at that point, using both clenched fists to\nbeat the air.\n\n\"Time limit?  There must be no time lost at all!  Have you promised to\nbe silent?  Have you promised not to breathe one little word to anybody?--\nNot to your own wife?  Not to Samson?--Above all not to Samson?\nThen I will tell you.\"\n\nGungadhura glanced about him like a stage conspirator.\n\n\"Go on,\" said Dick.  \"There's nobody here knows English except you\nand me.\"\n\n\"You are to dig for the treasure of Sialpore!  The treasure of my ancestors!\"\n\n\"Fifty thousand dibs--or one per cent. at my option, eh?  Make it two\nper cent., and draw your contract!\"\n\n\"Two per cent. is too much!\"\n\n\"Get another man to dig, then!\"\n\n\"Very well, I make it two per cent.  But you must hurry!\"\n\n\"Draw your contract.  Time limit how long?\"\n\n\"Two weeks--three weeks--not more than a month at the very utmost!\nYou draw the contract in English, and I will sign it this afternoon.  You\nmust begin to dig tomorrow at dawn!\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"In the grounds of the River Palace--across the river--beginning close\nto the great pipal trees.\"\n\n\"They're all outside the palace wall.  How in thunder can I keep secret\nabout that?\"\n\n\"You must begin inside the palace wall, and tunnel underground.\"\n\n\"Dirt's all soft down there,\" said Dick.  \"We'll need to prop up as we go.\nLots of lumber.  Cost like blazes.  Where's the lumber coming from?\"\n\n\"Cut down the pipal trees!\"\n\n\"Man--we'd need a mill!\"\n\n\"There is no lumber--not in such a hurry.\"\n\n\"What'll we do then?  Can't have accidents.\"\n\n\"Pah!  The lives of a few coolies, Mr. Blaine--\"\n\n\"Nothing doing, Maharajah sahib!  Murder's not my long suit.\"\n\n\"Then pull the palace down and use the beams!\"\n\n\"You'd have to put that in writing.\"\n\n\"Include it in the contract then!  Now, have we agreed?\"\n\n\"I guess so.  If I think of anything else I'll talk it over with you when I\nbring the contract round this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Good.  Then I will give you the map.\"\n\n\"Better give it me now, so I can study it.\"\n\n\"The--eh--risk of that is too great, Mr. Blaine!\"\n\n\"Seems to me your risk is pretty heavy as it is,\" Dick retorted.  \"If I was\ngoing to spill your secret, I could do it now, map or no map!\"\n\nThree times again Gungadhura paced the tunnel, torn between mistrust,\nimpatience and anxiety.  At last he thrust his bandaged face very close\nto Dick's and spoke in a level hard voice, smiling thinly.\n\n\"Very well, Mr. Blaine.  I will entrust the map to you.  But let me first tell\nyou certain things--certain quite true things.  Every attempt to steal that\ntreasure has ended in ill-luck!  There have been many.  All the conspirators\nhave died--by poison--by dagger--by the sword--by snake-bite--by bullets--\nthey have all died--always!  Do you understand?\"\n\nDick shuddered in spite of himself.\n\n\"Then take the map!\"\n\nGungadhura turned his back and fumbled in the folds of his semi-European\nclothing.  He produced the silver tube after a minute, removed the cap\nfrom one end, and shook out a piece of parchment.  There was a dull\ncrimson stain on it.\n\n\"The blood of a man who tried to betray the secret!\" said Gungadhura.\n\"See-the knife of an assassin pierced the tube, and blood entered through\nthe hole.  It happened long ago.\"\n\nBut he did not pass the tube to Dick that he might examine the knife mark.\n\n\"These notes on the edge of the map are probably in the hand of Jengal\nSingh, who stole it.  He died of snake-bite more than a year ago.  They\nare in Persian;  he notes that four of the trees are dead and only their\nroots remain;  therefore that measurements must allow for that.  You\nmust find the roots of the last tree, Mr. Blaine, and measure carefully\nfrom both ends, digging afterward in a straight line from inside the palace\nwall by compass.  Is it clear?\"\n\n\"I guess so.  Leave it with me and I'll study it.\"\n\nThe maharajah kept the tube and left the parchment in Dick's hands.\n\n\"This afternoon, then?\"\n\n\"This afternoon,\" said Dick.\n\nWhen he had gone, Dick resumed the very careful building of the masonry,\nplacing the last stones with his own hands.  Then he went out into the\nsunlight, to sit on a rock and examine the parchment with a little pocket\nmagnifying-glass that he always carried for business purposes.  He\nstudied it for ten minutes.\n\n\"It's clever,\" he said at last.  \"Dashed clever.  It 'ud fool the Prince of\nWales!\"  (Dick had astonishing delusions as to the supposed omniscience\nof the heir to the throne of England.)  \"The ink looks old, and it's not\nmetallic ink.  The parchment's as old as Methuselah--I'll take my oath\non that.  There's even different ink been used for the map and the\nmargin notes.  But that's new blood or my name's Mike!  That blood's\nnot a week old!  Phew!  I bet it's that poor devil Mukhum Dass!  Now--\nlet's figure on this:  Mukhum Dass burgled my house, and was murdered\nabout an hour afterward.  I think--I can't swear, because he didn't let\nme hold it, but I think that tube in Gungadhura's hand was the very identical\none that I hid under the cellar floor--that Mukhum Dass stole--and that\nthe maharajah now carries in his pocket.  This map has blood on it.\nWhat's the inference?\"\n\nHe filled his pipe and smoked reflectively.\n\n\"The inference is, that I'm accessory after the fact to the money-lender's\nmurder, unless\" -\n\nHe finished the pipe, and knocked the ashes out.\n\n\"--unless I break my promise, and hand this piece of evidence over to\nNorwood.  I guess he's arch-high-policeman here.\"\n\nAs if the guardian angel of Dick's conscience was at work that very\nminute to torment him, there came the sound of an approaching horse,\nand Samson turned the corner into view.\n\n\"Oh, hullo, Blaine!  How's the gold developing?\"\n\n\"So-so.  Have they found the murderer of Mukhum Dass yet?\"\n\nSamson dropped his reins to light a cigar, and took his time about it.\n\n\"Not exactly.\"\n\n\"Hum!  You either exactly find the murderer, or you don't!\"\n\n\"We've our suspicions.\"\n\n\"Leading anywhere?\"\n\n\"Too soon to say.\"\n\n\"If I was to offer to put you next to a piece of pretty evidence, how'd\nthat suit you?\"\n\nSamson had to relight the cigar, in order to get opportunity to read Dick's\nface before he answered.\n\n\"I don't think so, Blaine, thank you--at least not at present.  If you've\ndirect evidence of an eye-witness, of course--\"\n\n\"Nothing like that,\" said Dick.\n\n\"Well, I'll be candid with you, Blaine.  We know quite well who the\nmurderer is.  At the right moment we shall land on him hammer and tongs.\nBut you see--we need to choose the right moment, for political reasons.\nNow--technically speaking--all evidence in criminal cases ought to go\nto the police, and the police might act too hastily--you understand me?\"\n\n\"If you know who the man is, of course,\" said Dick, \"there's nothing\nmore I need do.\"\n\n\"Except to be discreet, Blaine!  Please be discreet!  We shall get the\nman.  Don't doubt it!  You and your wife have set us all an example\nhere of minding nobody's business except your own.  I'd be awfully\nobliged if you'd keep yourself as far as possible out of this mess.\nShould we need any further evidence than we've got already, I'd ask\nyou for it, of course.\"\n\n\"Suits me all right,\" said Dick.  \"I'm mum.\"\n\n\"Thanks awfully, Blaine.  Can I offer you a cigar?  I'm on my way to take\na look at the fort.  Seems like an anachronism, doesn't it, for us to keep\nan old-fashioned fort like this so near our own border in native territory.\nCare to come with me?  Well, so long then--see you at the club again,\nI suppose?\"\n\nSamson rode on.\n\n\"A narrow squeak that!\" said Dick to himself, stowing away the map that he\nhad held the whole time in his right hand in full view of the commissioner.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Nineteen\n\n\n\n\nThe East to Columbia\n\nSister Columbia, wonderful sister,\nWeariless wings on aerial way!\nTell us the lore of thy loftiness, sister,\nWe of the dark are astir for the day!\nGive us the gift of thy marvelous wings,\nSpell us the charm that Columbia sings!\n\nOversea sister, affluent sister,\nQueen inexclusive, though out of our reach!\nHow is thy genius ever unruffled?\nWhat is the talisman altitudes teach?\nMeasureless meed of ability thine,\nWhat is the goal of thy heart's design?\n\nHow shall we learn of it?  How shall we follow?\nHeavy the burden of earth where we lie!\nOnly a glimpse of thy miracle stirs us,\nStay in our wallow and teach us to fly!\nHow shall we spring to Columbia's call?\nOh, that thy wings could unweary us all!\n\n\n\"I am as simple as the sunlight!\"\n\nTess was in something very near to paradise, if paradise is constant\nassuaging of the curiosity amid surroundings that conduce to idleness.\nThere were men on that country-side in plenty who would not have dared\nadmit a Western woman into their homes;  but even those could hardly\nprevent wives and daughters from visiting Yasmini in the perfectly\ncorrect establishment she kept.  And there were other men, more fearless\nof convention, who were willing that Tess, if veiled, should cross their\nprivate thresholds.\n\nSo there followed a round of visits and return calls, of other marvelous\nrides by elephant at night, because the daytime was too hot for comfort,\nand oftener, long drives in latticed carriages, with footmen up behind and\nan escort to ride before and swear at the lethargic bullock-men--carriages\nthat bumped along the country roads on strange, old-fashioned springs.\n\nYasmini was welcome everywhere, and, in the cautious, tenfold guarded\nEastern way, kept open house.  The women reveled in her free ideas\nand in the wit with which she heaped scorn on the priest-made fashions\nthat have kept all India in chains for centuries, mocking the priests, as\nsome thought, at the risk of blasphemy.\n\nAlmost as much as in Yasmini's daring they took ingenuous delight in\nTess, persuading Yasmini to interpret questions and reply or, very rarely,\nbringing with them some duenna who had a smattering of English.\n\nAll imprisoned folk, and especially women in the shuttered zenanas\nof the East, develop a news-sense of their own that passes the\ncomprehension of free-ranging mortals.  They were astonishingly well\ninformed about the outer world--even the far-flung outer world, yet\nasked the most childish questions;  and only a few of them could have\nwritten their own names,--they who were titled ladies of a land of ancient\nchivalry.\n\n\"Wait until I am maharanee!\" Yasmini said.  \"The women have always\nruled India.  Women rule the English, though the English hate the thought\nof it and make believe otherwise.  With the aid of women I will change\nthe face of India,--the women and the gods!\"\n\nBut she was careful of her promises, holding out no prospects that\nwould stir premature activity among the ranks she counted on.\n\n\"Promise the gods too much,\" she said, \"and the gods overwhelm you.\nThey like to serve, which is their business, not to have you squandering\non them.  Tell the women they are rulers, and they will start to destroy\ntheir empire by making public what is secret!  If you tell the men that\nthe women rule them, what will the men do?\"\n\n\"Shut them up all the closer, I suppose,\" suggested Tess.\n\n\"Is that what they ever did?  No.  They will choose for them certain\noffices they can not fill because of inexperience, and put the noisiest\nwomen in them, and make mock of them, and laugh!  Not for a long\ntime yet must India know who rules her!\"\n\n\"Child, where did you learn all your philosophy?\" Tess asked her, one\nnight when they were watching the stars from the bedroom window-seat.\n\n\"Oh, men taught me this and that thing, and I have always reversed it\nand believed the opposite.  Why do men teach?  To make you free,\nor to bind you to their own wheel?  The English teach that English ways\nare good for the world.  I answer that the world has been good to England\nand the English would like to keep it so!  The pundits say we should\nstudy the philosophies.  They made me study, hours and hours when\nI was little.  Why?  To bind me to the wheel of their philosophy, and\nkeep me subject to them!  I say philosophy is good for pundits, as a\npond is good for frogs;  but shall I be a frog, too, and croak about the\nbeauties of the mud?  The priests say we should obey them, and pray,\nand make offerings, and keep the religious law.  I say, that religion is\ngood for priests, which is why they cherish it, and add to it, and persuade\nfoolish women to believe it!  As for the gods, if they are anything they\nare our servants!\"\n\n\"Your husband is going to have an interesting time,\" laughed Tess.\n\nYasmini's blue eyes suddenly turned soft and serious.\n\n\"Do you think I can not be a wife \"' she asked.  \"Do you suppose there\nis no mother-love in me?  Do you think I do not understand how a man\nneeds cherishing?  Do you think I will preach to my husband, or oppose\nhis plans?  No!  I will do as the gods do when the priests are asleep!\nI will let him go his own way, and will go with him, never holding back;\nand little by little he will learn that I have understanding.  Little by little\nhe will grow into knowledge of the things I know--and he will be a very\ngreat man!\"\n\nThere were no visits whatever from Utirupa, for the country-side would\nhave been scandalized.  Only, flowers came every day in enormous\nquantities;  and there was a wealth of horses, carriages, jewels and\narmed men at his bride's disposal that proved he had not forgotten\nher existence or her needs.  She had claimed marriage to him by\nGandharva rite, and he had tacitly consented, but she was not ready\nyet to try conclusions with the secret, octopus influence of the priests;\nand there was another reason.\n\n\"If it should get to Samson's cars that he and I are married, that would\nbe the end of his chance of the throne of Sialpore.  Samson is English\nof the English.  He would oppose to the end the nomination of a maha-rajah,\nwhose wife has notions of her own--as I am known to have!  They like him--\nmy husband--because he plays good polo, and will bet with them, and\ncan play cricket;  and because he seems to follow no special line of politics.\nBut if it were known he had a clever wife--me for wife--they would have\nnone of him!  I shall be a surprise for them when the die is cast!\"\n\nTess  was in almost daily communication with Dick, for, what with Tom Tripe\nand Sita Ram and about a dozen other sworn accomplices, Yasmini\nhad messages coming and going all the time.  Camels used to arrive\nlong after dark, and letters were brought in, smelly with the sweat of loyal\nriders who had hidden them from too inquisitive police.  Most of them\ncarried back a scribbled word for Dick.  But he said nothing about the\ntreasure in his curt, anonymous, unsigned replies, being nervous about\nsending messages at all.\n\nOnly, when in one letter he mentioned digging in another place, and\nTess read the sentence aloud, Yasmini squealed with delight.  The next\nday her own advices confirmed the hint, Sita Ram sending a long account\nof new developments and adding that \"Samson sahib is much exercised\nin mind about it.\"\n\n\"All goes well!\"  Yasmini belled in her golden voice.  \"Samson has seen\nthe hidden meaning of my letter!  If I had told him bluntly where the\ntreasure is, he would have laughed and forgotten it!  But because he\nthinks he reads the secret of my mind, he flatters himself and falls into\nthe trap!  Now we have Samson caught, and all is well!\"\n\n\"It would be a very canny person who could read the secret of your mind,\nI should say!\" laughed Tess.\n\n\"I am as simple as the sunlight!\" Yasmini answered honestly.  \"It is\nSamson who is dark, not I.\"\n\nYasmini began making ready for departure, giving a thousand orders\nto dependents she could trust.\n\n\"At the polo game,\" she asked Tess, \"when the English ask questions\nas to where you have been, and what you saw, what will you tell them?\"\n\n\"Why not the truth?  Samson expressly asked me to cultivate\nyour acquaintance.\"\n\n\"Splendid!  Tell them you traveled on camel-back by night across the\ndesert with me!  By the time they have believed that we will think of\nmore to add to it!  We return by elephant to Sialpore together, timing\nour arrival for the polo game.  There we separate.  You watch the game\ntogether with your husband.  I shall be in a closed carriage--part of\nthe time.  I shall be there all the time, but I don't think you will see me.\"\n\n\"But you say they have rifled your palace.  Where will you sleep?\" Tess asked.\n\n\"At your house on the hill!\"\n\n\"But that is in Gungadhura's territory.  Aren't you afraid of him?\"\n\n\"Of Gungadhura?  I?  I never was!  But now whoever fears him would\nrun from a broken snake.  I have word that the fool has murdered\nMukhum Dass the money-lender.  You may trust the English to draw\nhis teeth nicely for him after that!  Gungadhura is like a tiger in a net\nhe can not break!\"\n\n\"He might send men to break into the house,\" Tess argued.\n\n\"There will be sharper eyes than any of his watching!\"\n\nBut Tess was alarmed at the prospect.  She did not mind in the least\nwhat the English might have to say about it afterward;  but to have her\nlittle house the center of nocturnal feuds, with her husband using his\nsix-shooters, and heaven only knew what bloodshed resulting, was\nmore of a prospect than she looked forward to.\n\n\"Sister,\" said Yasmini, taking her by both hands.  \"I must use your house.\nThere is no other place.\"\n\nNo one could refuse her when her deep blue eyes grew soft and pleading,\nlet alone Tess, who had lived with her and loved her for a week.\n\n\"Very well,\" she answered;  and Yasmini's eyes softened and brightened\neven more.\n\n\"I shall not forget!\"\n\nGetting ready was no child's play.  It was to be a leisurely procession\nin the olden style, with tents, servants, and all the host of paraphernalia\nand hangers-on that that entails;  not across the desert this time, but\naround the edge of it, the way the polo ponies went, and out of Gungadhura's\nreach.  For, however truly Yasmini might declare that she was not afraid\nof Gungadhura (and she vowed she never boasted), she was running\nno unnecessary risks;  it takes a long time for the last rats to desert a\nsinking ship, (the obstinate go down with it), and just as long for the\nlast assassins to change politics.  She was eager to run all the risks\nwhen that was the surest strategy, but cautious otherwise.\n\nThe secret of her safety lay in the inviolable privacy surrounding woman's\nlife in all that part of India--privacy that the English have respected partly\nbecause of their own inherent sense of personal retirement, partly\nbecause it was the easiest way and saved trouble;  but mainly because\nIndia's women have no ostensible political power, and there is politics\nenough without bringing new millions more potential agitators into light.\nSo word of her life among the women did not travel swiftly to official\nears, as that of a male intriguer would certainly have done.  Utirupa\nwas busy all day long with polo, and the Powers that Be were sure of it,\nand pleased.  What Gungadhura knew, or guessed, was another matter;\nbut Gungadhura had his own hands full just then.\n\nSo they formed part of a procession that straggled along the miles,\nof elephants, camels and groups of ponies, carts loaded with tents,\nchattering servants, parties of Rajput gentlemen, beggars, hangers-on,\nretainers armed with ancient swords, mountebanks, several carriage-loads\nof women, who could sing and dance and were as particular about their\nveiling as if Lalun were not their ancestress, the inevitable faquirs,\ncamel-loads of entertainers, water-carriers, sheep, asses, and bullock-drawn,\nsqueaking two-wheeled carts aburst with all that men and animals could eat.\nThree days and nights of circus life, as Tess described it afterward to Dick.\n\nYasmini and Tess rode part of the way on an elephant, lying full-length\nin the hooded howdah with a view of all the country-side, starting before\ndawn and resting through the long heat of the day.  But monotony formed\nno part of Yasmini's scheme of life, and daring was the very breath she\nbreathed.  Most of the time they rode horseback together, disguised\nas men and taking to the fields whenever other parties drew too close.\nBut sometimes Yasmini left Tess on the elephant, and mingled freely\nwith the crowd, her own resourcefulness and intimate knowledge of\nthe language and the customs enough protection.\n\nNights were the amazing time.  A great camp spread out under ancient\ntrees--bonfires glowing everywhere, and native followers squatted around\nthem,--long, whinnying horse-lines--elephants, great gurgling shadows,\nswaying at their pickets--shouting, laughter, music,--and, over all, soft\npurple darkness and the stars.\n\nFor it was something more than a mere polo tournament that they were\ntraveling to.  It had grown out of a custom abolished by the government,\nof traveling once a year to Sialpore to air and consider grievances--\na custom dating from long before the British occupation, when the princes\nof the different states were all in rival camps and that was about the\nonly opportunity to meet on reasonably friendly terms.  In later years\nit had looked like developing into a focus of political solidity;  so some\ningenious commissioner had introduced the polo element, eliminating,\nitem after item, all the rest.  Then the date had been changed to the\nearly hot weather, in order to reduce attendance;  but the only effect\nthat had was to keep away the English from outlying provinces.  It was\nthe one chance that part of Rajputana had to get together, and the\nRajputs swarmed to the tournament--along the main trunk road that\nthe English had reconstructed in early days for the swifter movement\nof their guns.  (It did not follow any particular trade route, although trade\nhad found its way afterward along it.)\n\nYasmini saw Utirupa every night, she apparently as much a man as\nhe in turban and the comfortable Rajput costume--shorter by a bead,\nbut as straight-standing and as agile.  Tess and Hasamurti used to\nwatch them under the trees, ready to give the alarm in case of interruption,\nsometimes near enough to catch the murmured flow of confidence\nuniting them in secrecy of sacred, unconforming interviews.  It was\ncommon knowledge that Yasmini was in the camp, but she was always\nsupposed to be tented safely on the outskirts, with her women and a\nguard of watchful servants all about her.  There was no risk of an affront\nto her in any case;  it was known that Utirupa would attend to that.\n\nEach night between the bonfires there was entertainment--men who\nwalked tight-ropes, wrestlers, a  performing horse, ballad-singers and,\ndearest delight of all, the tellers of Eastern tales, who sat with silent\nrings of men about them and reeled off the old, loved, impossible\nadventures of the days when the gods walked with men on earth--stories\nof miracles and love and derring-do, with heroes who could fight a\nhundred men unscathed, and heroines to set the heart on fire.\n\nThen off again before sunrise in the cool amid the shouting and confusion\nof a breaking camp, with truant ponies to be hunted, and everybody\nyelling for his right of road, and the elephants sauntering urbanely through\nit all with trunks alert for pickings from the hay-carts.  They were nights\nand days superbly gorgeous, all-entertaining, affluent of humor.\n\nThen on the third day, nearing Sialpore toward evening they filed past\ntwo batteries of Royal Horse Artillery, drawn up on a level place beside\nthe road to let them by--an act of courtesy not unconnected with its\nown reward.  It is never a bad plan to let the possibly rebellious take\na long look at the engines of enforcement.\n\n\"Ah!\" laughed Yasmini, up in the howdah now beside Tess on the elephant,\n\"the guns of the gods!  I said the gods were helping us!\"\n\n\"Look like English guns to me,\" Tess answered.\n\n\"So think the English, too.  So thinks Samson who sent for them.  So, too,\nperhaps Gungadhura will think when he knows the guns are coming!\nBut I know better.  I never promise the gods too much, but let them\nmake me promises, and look on while they perform them.  I tell you,\nthose are the guns of the gods!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twenty\n\n\n\n\nA bad man ruined by the run of luck\nMay shed the slime--they've done it,\nTimes and again they've done it.\nThat turn to aspiration out of muck\nIs quick if heart's begun it,\nIf heart's desire's begun it.\nBut 'ware revenge if greater craft it is\nThat jockeyed him to recognize defeat,\nOr greater force that overmastered his--\nEfficiency more potent than deceit\nThat craved his crown and won it!\nSafer the she-bear with her suckling young,\nKinder the hooked shark from a yardarm hung,\nMore rational a tiger by the hornets stung\nThan perfidy outcozened.  Shun it!\n\n\n\"Millions!  Think of it!  Lakhs and crores!\"\n\nThe business of getting a maharajah off the throne, even in a country\nwhere the overlords are nervous, and there is precedent, is not entirely\nsimple, especially when the commissioner who recommends it has\na name for indiscretion and ambition.  The government of conquered\ncountries depends almost as much on keeping clever administrators\nin their place as on fostering subdivision among the conquered.\n\nSo, very much against his will, Samson was obliged to go to see a high\ncommissioner, who is a very important person indeed, and ram home\nhis arguments between four walls by word of mouth.  He did not take\nSita Ram with him, so there is a gap in the story at that point, partly\nbridged by Samson's own sketchy account of the interview to Colonel\nWilloughby de Wing, overheard by Carlos de Sousa Braganza the\nGoanese club butler, and reported to Yasmini at third hand.\n\nThere were no aeroplanes or official motor-cars at that time to take\nofficials at outrageous speed on urgent business.  But Samson's favorite\nstudy in his spare time was Julius Caesar, who usually traveled long\ndistances at the rate of more than a hundred miles a day, and was\nprobably short-winded from debauch into the bargain.  What the great\nJulius could do, Samson could do as well;  but in spite of whip and\nspur and post, ruthless robbery of other people's reserved accommodation,\nand a train caught by good luck on the last stage, it took him altogether\nseven valuable days and nights.  For there was delay, too, while the\nhigh commissioner wired to Simla in code for definite permission to\nbe drastic.\n\nThe telegram from the secretary of state pointed out, as Samson had\npredicted that it would, the desirability of avoiding impeachment and\ntrial if that were possible, in view of the state of public unrest in India\nand the notorious eagerness of Parliament at home to interfere in\nIndian affairs.\n\n\"Get him to abdicate!\" was the meat of the long message.\n\n\"Can you do it?\" asked the high commissioner.\n\n\"Leave that to me!\" boasted Samson.  \"And now this other matter.\nThese 'islands' as they're called.  It's absurd and expensive to continue\nkeeping up a fort inside the maharajah's territory.  There's no military\nadvantage to us in having it so near our border.  And there are totally\nunnecessary problems of administration that are entailed by the maharajah\nadministering a small piece of territory on our side of the river.  I've\nhad a contract drawn for your approval--Sir Hookum Bannerjee drew it,\nhe's a very able lawyer--stipulating with Utirupa, in consideration of our\nrecognition of himself and his heirs as rulers of the State of Sialpore,\nthat he shall agree to exchange his palace and land on our side of the\nriver against our fort on his side.  What do you think of it?\"\n\n\"It isn't a good bargain.  He ought to give us more than that in the\ncircumstances, against a fort and--and all that kind of thing.\"\n\n\"It's a supremely magnificent bargain!\" retorted Samson.  \"Altogether\noverlooking what we'll save in money by not having to garrison that\nabsurd fort, it's the best financial bargain this province ever had the\nchance of!\"\n\n\"How d'ye mean?\"\n\nSamson whispered.  Even those four solid walls were not discreet enough.\n\n\"The treasure of Sialpore is buried in the River Palace grounds!  Millions!\nThink of it--Millions!  Lakhs and crores!\"\n\nThe high commissioner whistled.\n\n\"That 'ud mean something to the province, wouldn't it!  Show me your proofs.\"\n\nHow Samson got around the fact that he had no actually definite proofs,\nhe never told.  But he convinced the high commissioner, who never\ntold either, unless to somebody at Simla, who buried the secret among\nthe State Department files.\n\n\"I'll wire Simla,\" said the high commissioner presently, \"for permission to\nauthorize you to set your signature to that contract on behalf of government.\nThe minute I get it I'll wire you to Sialpore and confirm by letter.  Now\nyou'd better get back to your post in a hurry.  And don't forget, it would\nbe difficult in a case like this to err on the side of silence, Samson.\nWho'll have to be told?\"\n\n\"Nobody but Willoughby de Wing.  I'll have to ask him for troops to\nguard the River Palace grounds.  There's a confounded American\ndigging this minute in the River Palace grounds by arrangement with\nGungadhura.  He'll have to be stopped, and I'll have to make some\nsort of explanation.\"\n\n\"What's an American doing in Sialpore?\"\n\n\"Prospecting.  Has a contract with Gungadhura.\"\n\n\"Um-m-m!  We'll have Standard Oil in next!  Better point out to Utirupa\nthat contracts with foreigner's aren't regarded cordially.\"\n\n\"That's easily done,\" said Samson.  \"Utirupa is nothing if not anxious\nto please.\"\n\n\"Yes, Utirupa is a very fine young fellow--and a good sportsman, too,\nI'm told.\"\n\n\"There is no reason why Utirupa should recognize the contract between\nGungadhura and the American.  It was a private contract--no official\nsanction.  If Gungadhura isn't in position to continue it--\"\n\n\"Exactly.  Well--good-by.  I'll look forward to a good report from you.\"\n\nBy train and horse and tonga Samson contrived to reach Sialpore on\nthe morning before the day set for the polo tournament.  He barely\nallowed himself time to shave before going to see Dick Blaine, and\nfound him, as he expected, at the end of the tunnel nearly a hundred\nyards long that started from inside the palace wall and passed out under it.\nThe guards at the gate did not dare refuse the commissioner admission.\nSo far, Dick had not begun demolition of the palace, but had dragged\ntogether enough lumber by pulling down sheds and outhouses.  He\nwas not a destructive-minded man.\n\n\"Will you come outside and talk with me?\" Samson shouted, amid the\ndin of pick and shovel work.\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\nDick's poker face was in perfect working order by the time they reached\nthe light.  But he stood with his back to the sun and let Samson have\nthe worst of the position.\n\n\"You're wasting time and money, Blaine.  I've come to tell you so.\"\n\n\"Now--that's good of you.\"\n\n\"Your contract with Gungadhura is not worth the paper it's written on.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"He will not be maharajah after noon today!\"\n\n\"You don't mean it!\"\n\n\"That information is confidential, but the news will be out by tomorrow.\nThe British Administration intends to take over all the land on this side of\nthe river.  That's confidential too.  Between you and me, our government\nwould never recognize a contract between you and Gungadhura.  I warned\nyou once, and your wife a second time.\"\n\n\"Sure, she told me.\"\n\n\"Well.  You and I have been friends, Blaine.  I'd like you to regard this\nas not personal.  But--\"\n\n\"Oh, I get you.  I'm to call the men off?  That it?\"\n\n\"You've only until tomorrow in any case.\"\n\n\"And Gungadhura, broke, to look to for the pay-roll!  Well--as you say,\nwhat's the use?\"\n\n\"I'd pay your men off altogether, if I were you.\"\n\n\"They're a good gang.\"\n\n\"No doubt.  We've all admired your ability to make men work.  But there'll\nbe a new maharajah in a day or two, and, strictly between you and me,\nas one friend to another, there'll be a very slight chance indeed of your\ngetting a contract from the incoming man to carry on your mining in the hills.\nI'd like to save you trouble and expense.\"\n\n\"Real good of you.\"\n\n\"Er--found anything down there?\" Samson nodded over his shoulder\ntoward the tunnel mouth.\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"Any signs of anything?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\nSamson looked relieved.\n\n\"By the way.  You mentioned the other day something about evidence\nrelating to the murder of Mukhum Dass.\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Was it anything important?\"\n\n\"Maybe.  Looked so to me.\"\n\n\"Would you mind giving me an outline of it?\"\n\n\"You said that day you knew who murdered Mukhum Dass?\"\n\n\"Yes.  When I got in this morning there was a note on my desk from\nNorwood, the superintendent of police, to say that they've arrested your\nbutler and cook, and the murderer of Mukhum Dass all hiding together\nnear a railway station.  The murderer has squealed, as you Americans say.\nThey often do when they're caught.  He has told who put him up to it.\"\n\n\"Guess I'll give you this, then.  It's the map out of the silver tube that\nMukhum Dass burgled from my cellar.  Gungadhura gave it to me with\ninstructions to dig here.  You'll note there's blood on it.\"\n\nSamson's eyes looked hardly interested as he took it.  Then he looked,\nand they blazed.  He put it in his inner pocket hurriedly.\n\n\"Too bad, Blaine!\" he laughed.  \"So you even had a map of the treasure, eh?\nAnother day or two and you'd have forestalled us!  I suppose you'd\na contract with Gungadhura for a share of it?\"\n\n\"You bet!\"\n\n\"Well--it wasn't registered.  I doubt if you could have enforced it.\nGungadhura is an awful rascal.\"\n\n\"Gee!\" lied Dick.  \"I never thought of that!  I had my other contract\nregistered all right--in your office--you remember?\"\n\n\"Yes.  I warned you at the time about Gungadhura.\"\n\n\"You did.  I remember now.  You did.  Well, I suppose the wife and I'll\nbe heading for the U. S. A. soon, richer by the experience.  Still--I reckon\nI'll wait around and see the new maharajah in the saddle, and watch\nwhat comes of it.\"\n\n\"You've no chance, Blaine, believe me!\"\n\n\"All right, I'll think it over.  Meanwhile, I'll whistle off these men.\"\n\nThe next man Samson interviewed was Willoughby de Wing.\n\n\"Let me have a commissioner's escort, please,\" he demanded.  \"I'm\ngoing to see Gungadhura now!  You'd better follow up with a troop to r\neplace the maharajah's guards around his palace.  We can't put him\nunder arrest without impeaching him;  but--make it pretty plain to the\nguard they're there to protect a man who has abdicated;  that no one's\nto be allowed in, and nobody out unless he can explain his business.\nThen, can you spare some guards for another job?  I want about twenty\nmen on the River Palace at once.  Caution them carefully.  Nobody's\nto go inside the grounds.  Order the maharajah's guards away!  It's a\nlittle previous.  His officers will try to make trouble of course.  But an\napology at the proper time will cover that.\"\n\n\"What's the new excitement?\" asked the colonel.  \"More murders?\nMore princesses out at night?\"\n\n\"This is between you and me.  Not a word to a living soul, De Wing!\"\nSamson paused, then whispered:  \"The treasure of Sialpore!\"\n\n\"What--in the palace?\"\n\n\"In the grounds!  There's a tunnel already half-dug, leading toward it\nfrom inside the palace wall.  I've proof of the location in my pocket!\"\n\n\"Gad's teeth!\" barked Willoughby de Wing.  \"All right, I'll have your\nescort in a jiffy.  Have a whisky and soda, my boy, to stiffen you before\nthe talk with Gungadhura!\"\n\nA little less than half an hour later Samson drove across the bridge in\nthe official landau, followed by an officer, a jemadar, a naik and eight\ntroopers of De Wing's Sikh cavalry.  Willoughby de Wing drove in the\ncarriage with him as a witness.  They entered the palace together, and\nwere kept waiting so long that Samson sent the major-domo to the\nmaharajah a second time with a veiled threat to repeat, said slowly:\n\n\"Say the business is urgent and that I shall not be held responsible\nfor consequences if he doesn't see me at once!\"\n\n\"Gad!\" swore De Wing, screwing in his monocle.  \"I'd like a second\nwhisky and soda!  I suppose there's none here.  I hate to see a man\nbroke--even a blackguard!\"\n\nGungadhura received them at last, seated, in the official durbar room.\nThe bandages were gone from his face, but a strip of flesh-colored\ncourt-plaster from eye to lip gave him an almost comical look of dejection,\nand he lolled in the throne-chair with his back curved and head hung\nforward, scowling as a man does not who looks forward to the interview.\n\nSamson cleared his throat, and read what be had to say, holding the\npaper straight in front of him.\n\n\"I have a disagreeable task of informing Your Highness that your\ncorrespondence with the Mahsudi tribe is known to His Majesty's Government.\"\n\nGungadhura scowled more deeply, but made no answer.\n\n\"Amounting as it does to treason, at a time when His Majesty's Government\nare embarrassed by internal unrest, your act can not be overlooked.\"\n\nGungadhura made a motion as if to interrupt, but thought better of it.\n\n\"In the circumstances I have the honor to advise Your Highness that\nthe wisest course, and the only course that will avoid impeachment,\nis abdication.\"\n\nGungadhura shook his head violently.\n\n\"I can explain,\" he said. \"I have proofs.\"\n\nSamson turned the paper over--paused a moment--and began to read\nthe second sheet.\n\n\"It is known who murdered Mukhum Dass.  The assassin has been\ncaught, and has confessed.\"\n\nGungadhura's eyes that had been dull, and almost listless hitherto,\nbegan to glare like an animal's.\n\n\"I have here--\" Samson reached in his pocket, \"a certain piece of parchment--\na map in fact--that was stolen from the body of Mukhum Dass.  Perhaps\nYour Highness will recognize it.  Look!\"\n\nGungadhura looked, and started like a man stung.  Samson returned\nthe map to his pocket, for the maharajah almost looked like trying to\nsnatch it;  but instead he collapsed in his chair again.\n\n\"If I abdicate?\" he asked, as if his throat and lips could hardly form the words.\n\n\"That would be sufficient.  The assassin would then be allowed to plead\nguilty to another charge there is against him, and the matter would be dropped.\"\n\n\"I abdicate!\"\n\n\"On behalf of His Majesty's Government I accept the abdication.  Sign\nthis, please.\"\n\nSamson laid a formal written act of abdication on the table by the throne.\nGungadhura signed it.  Willoughby de Wing wrote his signature as witness.\nSamson took it back and folded it away.\n\n\"Arrangements will be made for Your Highness to leave Sialpore tomorrow\nmorning, with a sufficient escort for your protection.  Provision will be\nmade in due course for your private residence elsewhere.  Be good\nenough to hold yourself and your family in readiness tomorrow morning.\"\n\n\"But my son!\" exclaimed Gungadhura.  \"I abdicate in favor of my son!\"\n\n\"In case of abdication by a reigning prince, or deposition of a reigning\nprince,\" said Samson, \"the Government of India reserves the right to\nappoint his successor, from among eligible members of his family if\nthere be any, but to appoint his successor in any case.  There is\nample precedent.\"\n\n\"And my son?\"\n\n\"Will certainly not be considered.\"\n\nGungadhura glanced about him like a frenzied man, and then lay back\nin a state of near-collapse.  Samson and De Wing both bowed, and\nleft the room.\n\n\"Poor devil!\" said De Wing, \"I'm sorry for him.\"\n\n\"Would you be a good fellow,\" said Samson, \"and send off this wire\nfor me?  There--I've added the exact time of the abdication.  I've got\nto go now and summon a durbar of Gungadhura's state officers, and\ntell them in confidence what's happened.  I shall hint pretty broadly that\nUtirupa is our man, and then ask them which prince they'd like to\nhave succeed.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said De Wing.  \"Nothing like tact!  Why not meet me at the\nclub for a whisky and soda afterward?\"\n\nInside the durbar hall Gungadhura sat alone for just so long as it took\nthe sound of the closing door to die away.  Then another door, close\nbehind the throne chair opened, and Patali entered.  She looked at him\nwith pity on her face, and curiosity.\n\n\"That American sold you,\" she said after a minute.\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"I say, that American sold you!  He sold you, and the map, and the\ntreasure to the English!\"\n\n\"I know it!  I know it!\"\n\n\"If I were a man--\"\n\nShe waited, but he gave no sign of manhood.\n\n\"If I were a man I know what I would do!\"\n\n\"Peace, Patali!  I am a ruined man.  They will all desert me as soon\nas the news is out.  They are deserting now;  I feel it in my bones.  I\nhave none to send.\"\n\n\"Send?  It is only maharajahs who must send.  Men do their own work!\nI know what I would do to an American or any other man, who sold me!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twenty-One\n\n\n\n\nThe king sent his army and said, \"Lo, I did it.  Consider my prowess\nand my strategy!\"  But the gods laughed. --Eastern proverb\n\n\n\"The guns of the gods!\"\n\nVery shortly after dawn on the morning of the polo game Yasmini left\nthe Blaines' house on business of her own.  The news of Gungadhura's\nabdication was abroad already, many times multiplied by each mouth\nuntil two batteries of guns had become an army corps.  But what caused\nthe greatest excitement was the news, first of all whispered, then\nconfirmed, that Gungadhura himself was missing.\n\nThat disturbing knowledge was the factor that prevented Yasmini from\nreturning to her own rifled palace and making the best of it;  for it would\ntake time to hedge the place about properly with guards.  There was\nsimply no knowing what Gungadhura might be up to.  She judged it\nprobable that he had seen through her whole plot in the drear light of\nrevelation that so often comes to stricken men, and in that case her\nown life was likely in danger every second he was still at liberty.  But\nshe sent word to Utirupa, too, to be on the alert.  And she saw him\nherself that morning, in her favorite disguise of a rangar zemindari,\nwhich is a Rajput landowner turned Muhammadan.  The disguise\nprecluded any Hindu interference, and Muhammadans on that country-side,\nwho might have questioned her, were scarce.\n\nThe polo did not take place until late afternoon, because of the heat,\nbut the grounds were crowded long before the time by a multi-colored\nswarm in gala mood, whom the artillerymen, pressed into service as\nline-keepers, had hard work to keep back of the line.  There was a rope\naround three sides of the field, but it broke repeatedly, and in the end\nthe gunners had to be stationed a few feet apart all down the side\nopposite the grand-stand to keep the crowd from breaking through.\n\nThere were carriages in swarms, ranging from the spider-wheel gig\nof a British subaltern to the four-in-hand of Rajput nobility--kept pretty\ncarefully apart, though.  The conquerors of India don't mix with the\nconquered, as a rule, except officially.  And there were half a dozen\nshuttered carriages that might have contained ladies, and might not;\nnone knew.\n\nIt was a crowd that knew polo from the inside outward, and when the\nponies were brought at last and stood in line below the grand-stand,\neach in charge of his sais, there grew a great murmur of critical approval;\nfor the points of a horse in Rajputana are as the lines of a yacht at\nMarblehead, and the marks of a dog in Yorkshire;  the very urchins\nknow them.  The Bombay side of India had been scoured pretty\nthoroughly for mounts for that event.  The Rajputs had on the whole\nthe weight of money, and perhaps the showiest ponies, but the English\nteam, nearly all darker in color as it happened, except for one pie-bald,\nlooked trained up to the last notch and bore the air of knowing just\nwhat to expect, that is as unmistakable in horses as in men.\n\nTom Tripe was there with his dog.  Trotters had the self-imposed and\nwholly agreeable task of chasing all unattached dogs off the premises.\nBut Tom Tripe himself was keeping rather in the background, because\ntechnically, as a servant of Gungadhura, he was in a delicate position.\nA voice that he could swear he almost recognized whispered to him\nin the crowd that the English were going to forbid the next maharajah\nto have any but employees of his own race.  And a laugh that he could\npick out of a million greeted his change of countenance.  But though\nhe turned very swiftly, and had had no brandy since morning to becloud\nhis vision, he failed to see his tormentor.\n\nTess and Dick drove down in ample time, as they had imagined, and\nfound hard work to squeeze the dog-cart in between the phalanxes of\nwheels already massed on the ground.  When they went to the grand-stand\nit was to find not a seat left in the rows reserved for ordinary folk;  so\nSamson, who arrived late too, magnificent in brand-new riding-boots,\ninvited them to sit next him in front.\n\nThe ground was in perfect condition--a trifle hard, because of the season,\nbut flat as a billiard table and as fast as even Rajputs could desire.\nA committee of them had been going over it daily for a week past,\nrecommending touches here, suggesting something there, neglecting\nnot an inch, because the finer stick-work of the Rajput team would be\nlost on uneven ground;  and the English had been sportsmen enough\nto accommodate them without a murmur.\n\nWhen a little bell rang and the teams turned out for the first chukker in\ndeathly-silence, it was evident at once what the Rajput strategy would be.\nThey had brought out their fastest ponies to begin with, determined to\ntake the lead at the start and hold it.\n\nOne could hear the crowd breathe when the whistle blew;  for in India\npolo is a game to watch, not an opportunity for small talk.  Instantly the\nball went clipping toward the English goal, to be checked by Topham\nat full-back, who sent it out rattling to the right wing.  But the Rajput left-wing\nman, a young cousin of Utirupa, cut in like an arrow.  The ball crossed\nover to the right wing, where Utirupa took it, galloping down the line on\na chestnut mare that had the speed of wind.  Topham, racing to intercept\nthe ball, missed badly;  a second later the Rajput center thundered\npast both men and scored the goal, amid a roar from the spectators,\nless than a minute from the start.\n\n\"Dick!\" Tess exclaimed.  \"You ought to be ashamed of me!  I'm rooting\nfor the Rajputs against my own color!\"\n\n\"So'm I!\" he answered.  \"I wish to glory there was some one here to bet with!\"\n\nSamson overheard.\n\n\"Which way do you want to bet?\" he asked.\n\n\"A thousand on the Rajputs.\"\n\n\"Thousand what?\"\n\n\"Dollars.  Three thousand rupees.\"\n\n\"Confound it, you Americans are all too rich!  Never mind, I'll take you.\"\n\n\"A bet!\" Dick answered, and both men wrote it down.\n\nAbout nine words were said by the captain of the English team as they\nrode back to the center of the field, and when the ball was in play again\nthere was no more of the scattering open play that suited the other\nside, but a close, short-hitting, chop-and-follow method that tried ponies'\ntempers, and a scrimmage every ten yards that made all unavailing the\nRajputs' speed and dash.  Whenever a stroke of lightning wrist-work\nsent the ball clipping down-field Topham returned it to the center and\nthe scrimmage began all over again.  The first chukker ended in mid-field,\nwith the score 1--0.\n\nBoth sides brought out fresh ponies for the second, and the Rajputs\ntried again to score with their favorite tactics of long-hitting and tremendous\nspeed.  But the English were playing dogged-does-it, and Topham\non the pie-bald at full back was invincible.  Nothing passed him.  Nor\nwere the English slow.  Three times they seized opportunity in mid-field\nand rode with a burst of fiery hitting toward the Rajput goal.  Three times\nthe gunners down the line began to yell.  The English team were getting\ntogether, and the Rajputs a little wild.  But the chukker ended with the\nsame score, 1--0.\n\n\"How d'you feel about it now?\" asked Samson, looking as calm as the\nEnglish habitually do whenever their pulse beats furiously.\n\n\"I'd like to bet too!\" Tess laughed, leaning across.\n\n\"What--the same sized bet?\"\n\n\"No, a hundred.\"\n\n\"Dollars ?\"\n\n\"Rupees!\" she laughed.  \"I'm not so rich as my husband.\"\n\n\"Can't refuse a lady!\" Samson answered, noting the bet down.  \"I shall\nbe a rich man tonight.  They play a brilliant game, those fellows, but\nwe always beat them in the end.\"\n\n\"How do you account for that?\" Dick asked, suspecting what was coming.\n\n\"Oh, in a number of ways, but chiefly because they lack team-loyalty\namong themselves.  They're all jealous of one another, whereas our\nfellows play as a unit.\"\n\nAs if in confirmation of Samson's words the Rajput team seemed rather\nto go to pieces in the third chukker.  There was the same brilliant individual\nhitting, and as much speed as ever, but the genius was not there.  In\nvain Utirupa took the ball out of a scrimmage twice and rode away with it.\nHe was not backed up in the nick of time, and before the end of the\nthird minute the English scored.\n\n\"You'd better go and hedge those bets,\" laughed Samson when the\nchukker ended.  \"There are plenty of the native gentry over yonder who'd\nbe delighted to gamble a fortune with you yet!\"\n\nDick scarcely heard.  He was watching Utirupa, who stood by the pony-line\nwhere a sais was doing something to a saddle girth.  A rangar came\nup to the prince and spoke to him--a slim, young-looking man, a head\nthe shorter of the two, with a turban rather low over his eyes, and the\nloose end of it, for some reason, across the lower half of his face.\nDick nudged Tess, and she nodded.  After that Utirupa appeared to\nspeak in low tones to each member of his own team.\n\n\"I beg your pardon.  What was that you said?\" asked Dick.\n\n\"I say you'd better hedge those bets.\"\n\n\"I'll double with you, if you like!\"\n\n\"Good heavens, man!  I've wagered a month's pay already!  Go and\nbet with Willoughby de Wing or one of the gunner officers.\"\n\nThe rangar disappeared into the crowd before the teams rode out for\nthe fourth encounter, and Tess, who had made up her mind to watch\nthe shuttered carriages that stood in line together in a roped enclosure\nof their own, became too busy with the game.  Something had happened\nto the Rajputs.  They no longer played with the gallery-appealing\nsmash-and-gallop fury that won them the first goal, although their speed\nheld good and the stick-work was marvelous.  But they seemed more\nwilling now to mix it in the middle of the field, and to ride off an opponent\ninstead of racing for the chance to shine individually.  It became the\nEnglish turn to drive to the wings and try to clear the ball for a hurricane\nrace down-field;  and they were not quite so good at those tactics as\nthe other side were.\n\nAll the rest of that game until the eighth, chukker after chukker, the\nRajputs managed to reverse the usual procedure, obliging the English\nteam to wear itself out in terrific efforts to break away, tiring men and\nponies in a tight scramble in which neither side could score.\n\n\"It looks like a draw after all,\" said Samson.  \"Bets off in that case, I suppose?\nDisappointing game in my opinion.\"\n\n\"'Tisn't over yet,\" said Dick.\n\nThe Rajputs were coming out for the last chukker with their first and\nfastest ponies that had rested through the game;  and they were smiling.\nUtirupa had said something that was either a good joke or else vastly\nreassuring.  As a matter of fact he had turned them loose at last to play\ntheir old familiar game again, and from the second that the ball went\ninto play the crowd was on tiptoe, swaying this and that way with excitement.\n\nIn vain the English sought to return to the scrimmage play;  it was too late.\nThe Rajputs had them rattled.  Topham at full-back on the pie-bald was\na stone wall, swift, hard-hitting and resourceful, but in vain.  Swooping\ndown the wings, and passing with the dextrous wrist-work and amazing\nbody-bends that they alone seem able to accomplish, they put the\nEnglish team on the defensive and kept them there.  Once, at about\nhalf-time, by a dash all together the English did succeed in carrying t\nhe ball down-field, but that was their last chance, and they missed it.\nIn the last two minutes the Rajputs scored two goals, the last one\ndriven home by Utirupa himself, racing ahead of the field with whirling\nstick and the thunder of a neck-and-neck stampede behind him.\n\n\"That'll be your month's pay!\" laughed Dick.  \"I hope you won't starve\nfor thirty days!\"\n\nThe crowd went mad with delight, and swarmed on to the ground, shouting\nand singing.  Samson got up, looking as if he rather enjoyed to lose\nthree thousand rupees in an afternoon.\n\n\"If you'll excuse me,\" he said, I'll go and shake hands with Utirupa.  He\ndeserves congratulation.  It was head-work won that game.\"\n\n\"I wonder what she said to him at the end of the third chukker,\" Tess\nwhispered to Dick.\n\nSamson found Utirupa giving orders to the saises, and shook hands\nwith him.\n\n\"Good game, Utirupa!  Congratulate you.  By the way:  there's going\nto be a meeting on important business in my office half an hour from now.\nWhen you've had a tub and a change, I wish you'd come and join us.\nWe want a word with you.\"\n\n\"Where are the gunners going to?\" asked Tess.  \"The men who kept\nthe line--look!  They're all trooping off the ground in the same direction.\"\n\n\"Dunno,\" said her husband.  \"Let's make for the dog-cart and drive home.\nIf we hang around Samson'll think we're waiting for that money!\"\n\nHalf an hour after that, Utirupa presented himself at Samson's office\nin the usual neat Rajput dress that showed off his lithe figure and the\nstraightness of his stature.  There was quite a party there to meet him--\nSamson, Willoughby de Wing, Norwood, Sir Hookum Bannerjee, Topham\n(still looking warm and rather weary after the game)--and outside on\nthe open ground beyond the compound wall two batteries of horse-guns\nwere drawn up at attention.  But if Utirupa felt surprise he did not show it.\n\n\"To make a short story of a long one, Prince Utirupa,\" Samson began\nat once, \"as you know, Gungadhura abdicated yesterday.  The throne\nof Sialpore is vacant, and you are invited to accept it.  I have here the\nrequired authority from Simla.\"\n\nUtirupa rose from his chair, and bowed.\n\n\"I am willing to accep,\" he answered quietly.  His face showed no emotion.\n\n\"There is one stipulation, though,\" said Samson.  \"We are tired of these\nfoolish 'islands'--our territory in yours and yours in ours.  There's a contract\nhere.  As your first official act--there's no time like the present--we want\nyou to exchange the River Palace, on this side of the river, for out fort\non your side.\"\n\nUtirupa said never a word.\n\n\"It's not a question of driving a bargain,\" Samson went on.  \"We don't\nknow what the palace may be worth, or what is in it.  If there is any valuable\nfurniture you'd like removed, we'll waive that point;  but on the terms\nof the contract we exchange the fort, with the guns and whatever else\nis there except the actual harness and supplies of the garrison, against\nthe land and palace and whatever it contains except furniture.\"\n\nUtirupa smiled--perhaps because the guns in that fort were known to\ndate from before the Mutiny.\n\n\"Will you agree?\"\n\n\"I will sign,\" said Utirupa.  And he signed the contract there and then,\nin presence of all those witnesses.  Ten minutes later, as he left the\noffice, the waiting batteries fired him a fourteen-gun salute, that the\nworld might know how a new maharajah occupied the throne of Sialpore.\n\nMeanwhile, up at the house on the hill Tess and Dick found Yasmini\nalready there ahead of them, lying at her ease, dressed as a woman\nof women, and smoking a cigarette in the window-seat of the bedroom\nTess had surrendered to her.\n\n\"What was it you said to him after the third chukker?\" was the first\nquestion Tess asked.\n\n\"You recognized me?\"\n\n\"Sure.  So did my husband.  What did you say to him?\"\n\n\"Oh, I just said that if he hoped to win he must play the game of the\nEnglish, and play it better, that was all.  He won, didn't he?  I didn't stay\nto the end.  I knew he would win.\"\n\nAlmost as they spoke the fourteen-gun salute boomed out from across\nthe river, and echoed from the hills.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Yasmini.  \"Listen!  The guns of the gods!  He is maharajah now.\"\n\n\"But what of the treasure?\" Tess asked her.  \"Dick told me this morning\nthat the English have a guard all round the River Palace, and expect\nto dig the treasure up themselves.\"\n\n\"Perhaps the English need it more than he and I do,\" Yasmini answered.\n\nThat evening Tom Tripe turned up, and Yasmini came down-stairs to\ntalk with him, Trotters remaining outside the window with his ash-colored\nhair on end and a succession of volcanic growls rumbling between\nflashed teeth.\n\n\"What's the matter with the dog, that he won't come in?\" asked Tess.\n\n\"Nothing, ma'arm  He's just encouraging himself.  He stays here tonight.\"\n\n\"Trotters does?  Why?\"\n\n\"It's known all over Sialpore that her ladyship's staying here, and\nGungadhura's at large somewhere.\n\nYou're well guarded;  that's been seen to, but Trotters stays for double\ninner-guard.  One or two men might go to sleep.  Gungadhura might\npass them a poisoned drink, or physic their rations in some way.\nAnd then,  they're what you might call fixed point men here, one there,\nwith instructions they'll be skinned alive and burned if they leave their\nexact position.  Trotters has a roving commission, to nose and snarl\nwhenever he's minded.  You can't poison him, for he won't eat from\nstrangers.  You can't see to knife him in the dark, because he's ash-colored\nand moves too swift.  And if Gungadhura comes an' shoots at where\nTrotters' eyes gleam--well--Mr. Dick Blaine is liable to wake up an' show\nhis highness how Buffalo Billy imitates a Gatling gun!  The house is\nsafe, but I thought I'd come and mention it.\"\n\n\"When will my palace be ready?\" Yasmini asked.\n\n\"Tomorrow or the next day, Your Ladyship.  There wasn't so much taken\nout after all, though a certain amount was stolen.  The first orders the\nnew maharajah gave were to have your palace attended to;  and some\nof the stolen stuff is coming in already;  word went out that if stuff was\nreturned there'd be nothing said, but if it weren't returned there'd be\nsomething brand-new in the line of trouble for all concerned.  The priests\nhave been told to pass the word along.  'No obedience from priests,\nno priests at the coronation ceremony!--It's my belief from about two\nhours' observation that we've got a maharajah now with guts, if you'll\nexcuse my bad French, please, ma'am.\"\n\n\"What does it matter to you, Tom, whether he is good or not?\" Yasmini\nasked mischievously.  Isn't there a rumor that the English won't allow\nany but the native-born instructors after this?\"\n\n\"Ah, naughty, naughty!\" he laughed, shaking a gnarled forefinger.\n\"I thought it was your voice in the crowd.  Your Ladyship 'ud like to\nhave me all nervous, wouldn't you?  Well--if Tom Tripe was out of a\njob tomorrow, the very first person he'd apply to for a new one would\nbe the Princess Yasmini;  and she'd give it him!\"\n\n\"What have you in your hand?\" Yasmini asked.\n\n\"Gungadhura's turban that he wore the night when Akbar chased him\ndown the street.\"\n\nYasmini nodded, understanding instantly.\n\nFive minutes later, after a rousing stiff night-cap, Tom took his leave.\nThey heard his voice outside the window:\n\n\"Trotters!\"\n\nThe dog's tail beat three times on the veranda.\n\n\"Take a smell o' this!\"\n\nThere was silence, followed by a growl.\n\n\"If he comes,--kill him!  D'ye understand?  Kill him!  There--there's the\nturban for you to lie on an' memorize the smell!  Kill him!  Ye understand?\"\n\nA deep growl was the answer, and Tom Tripe marched off toward the\nstables for his horse, whistling Annie Rooney, lest some too enthusiastic\nwatcher knife him out of a shadow.\n\n\"When I am maharanee,\" said Yasmini, \"Tom Tripe shall have the title\nof sirdar, whether the English approve of it or not!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twenty-Two\n\n\n\n\nThe Creator caused flowers to bloom in the desert and buried jewels\nin the bosom of the earth.  That is lest men should grow idle, wallowing\nin delights they have, instead of acquiring merit in the search for\nbeauty that is out of reach.  --Eastern Proverb\n\n\n\"Making one hundred exactly.\"\n\nTechnically, Yasmini was as much maharanee of Sialpore as she would\never be, the moment that the fourteen-gun salute boomed out across\nthe river.  For the English do not recognize a maharanee, except as\ncourtesy title.  The reigning prince is maharajah, and, being Hindu, can\nhave one wife or as many as he pleases.  Utirupa and Yasmini claimed\nto have married themselves by Gandharva rite, and, had she chosen,\nshe could have gone to live with him that minute.\n\nBut that would not have paid her in the long run.  The priests, for instance,\nwhom she despised with all her character, would have been outraged\ninto life-long enmity;  and she knew their power.\n\n\"It is one thing,\" she told Tess, \"to determine to be rid of cobras;  but\nanother to spurn them with your hand and foot.  They bite!\"\n\nThen again, it would not have suited her to slip quietly into Utirupa's\npalace and assume the reins of hidden influence without the English\nknowing it.  She proposed taking uttermost advantage of the purdah\ncustom that protects women in India from observation and makes\ncontact between them and the English almost impossible.  But she\nintended, too, to force the Indian Government into some form of\nrecognition of her.\n\n\"If they acknowledge me, they lock swords with every woman in the\ncountry.  Let them deny me afterward, and all those swords will quiver\nat their throats!  A woman's sword is subtler than a man's.\"\n\n(That was the secret of her true strength in all the years that followed.\nIt was never possible to bring her quite to bay, because the women\npulled hidden strings for her in the sphere that is above and below the\nreach of governments.)  So she moved back into her own palace, where\nshe received only Tess of all the Anglo-Saxon women in India.\n\n\"Why don't you keep open house to English women, and start something?\"\nTess asked her.  But Yasmini laughed.\n\n\"My power would be gone.  Do you fight a tiger by going down on all-fours\nwith him and using teeth and claws?  Or do you keep your distance,\nand use a gun?\"\n\n\"But the English women are not tigresses.\"\n\n\"If they were, I would laugh at them.  Trapping tigers is a task the jungle\ncoolies can attend to well!  But if I admit the English women into my\npalace, they will come out of curiosity.  And out of pity, or compassion\nor some such odious emotion they will invite me to their homes, making\nan exhibition of me to their friends.  Should I be one of them?  Never!\nWould they admit other Indian women with me?  Certainly;  any one I\ncared to recommend.  They would encourage us to try to become their\nsocial equals, as they would call it, always backing away in front of us\nand beckoning, we striving, and they flattered.  No!  I will reverse that.\nI will have the English women striving to enter our society!  They shall\nwake up one day to discover there is something worth having that is\nout of reach.  Then see the commotion!  Watch the alteration then!\nToday they say, when they trouble to think of us at all, 'Come and visit us;\nour ways are good;  we will not hurt you;  come along,' as the children\ncall to a kitten in the street.  Then they will say,  'We have this and that\nto offer.  We desire your good society.  Will you admit us if we bring\nour gifts?'  That will be another story, but it will take time.\"\n\n\"More than time,\" Tess answered.  \"Genius.\"\n\n\"I have genius.  That is why I know too much to declare war on the priests.\nI shall have a proper wedding, and priests shall officiate, I despising\nthem and they aware of it.  That will be their first defeat.  They shall\ncome to my marriage as dogs come to their mistress when she calls--\nand be whipped away again if they fawn too eagerly!  They will not dare\nrefuse to come, because then war would be joined, and I might prove\nto people how unnecessary priests are.  But they are more difficult to\ndeal with than the English.  A fat hypocrite like Jinendra's high priest is\nlike a carp to be caught with a worm, or an ass to be beaten with a stick;\nbut there are others--true ascetics--lusting for influence more than a\nbellyful, caring nothing for the outside of the power if they hold the nut--\nnothing for the petals, if they hold the seed.  Those men are not easy.\nFor the present I shall seem to play into their hands, but they know that\nI despise them!\"\n\nSo great preparations were made for a royal wedding.  And when\nSamson heard that Yasmini was to be Utirupa's bride he was sufficiently\ndisgusted, even to satisfy Yasmini, who was no admirer of his.  Sita Ram's\naccount of Samson's rage, as he explained the circumstance to Willoughby\nde Wing, was almost epic.\n\n\"Damn the woman!  And damn him!  She's known for a trouble-maker.\nSimla will be asking me why on earth I permitted it.  They'll want to know\nwhy I didn't caution Utirupa and warn him against that princess in particular.\nShe's going to parade through the streets under my very nose and in\nflat defiance of our government, just at the very time when I've gone\non record as sponsor for Utirupa.  I've assured them he wouldn't do\nan ill-advised thing, and I specifically undertook to see that he married\nwisely.  But it was too early yet to speak to him about it.  And here he\nsprings this offense on me!  It's too bad--too bad!\"\n\n\"You'll be all right with Simla,\" said Willoughby de Wing.  \"Dig up the\ntreasure and they'll recommend you for the K. C. B., with the pick of\nall the jobs going!\"\n\n\"They don't give K. C. B.'s to men in my trade,\" Samson answered\nrather gloomily.  \"They reserve them for you professional butchers.\"\n\nHe was feeling jumpy about the treasure, and dreaming of it all night\nlong in a way that did not make the waking fears more comfortable.\nA whole company of sappers bad been sent for;  and because of the\nneed of secrecy for the present, a special appropriation had had to\nbe made to cover the cost of lumber for the tunnel that Dick began,\nand that the sappers finished.  They had dug right up to the pipal trees,\nand half-killed them by tunneling under their roots along one side;  but\nwithout discovering anything so far, except a few old coins.  (The very\nancient golden mohur in the glass case marked \"Sialpore\" in the\nAllahabad Museum is one of them.)  Now they were going to tunnel\ndown the other side and kill the ancient trees completely.\n\nBeing a man of a certain courage, Samson had it in mind--perhaps--\nto send the map to an expert for an opinion on it.  Only, he hated experts;\nthey were so bent always on establishing their own pet theory.  And it\nwas late--a little late for expert opinions on the map.  The wisest way\nwas to keep silent and continue digging, even if the operation did kill\nancient landmarks that one could see--from across the river, for instance.\n\nAnd, of course, he could not refuse to recognize the wedding officially\nand put on record the name, ancestry and title of the maharajah's legal\nfirst wife.  Nor could he keep away, because, with amazingly shrewd\njudgment, Yasmini had contrived the novelty of welding wedding and\ncoronation ceremony and festival in one.  Instead of two successive\noutbursts of squandering, there would be only one.  It was economic\nprogress.  One could not withhold approval of it.  He must go in person,\nsmile, give a valuable present (paid for by the government, of course),\nand say the proper thing.\n\nOne modicum of consolation did ooze out of the rind of Samson's\nsituation.  It would have been no easier, be reflected, to say the right\nthing at the right time at the coronation ceremony, especially to the\nright people, if that treasure should already have been dug up and\nreposing in the coffers of the Indian Government.  After a certain sort\nof bargain, one's tongue feels unpleasant in one's cheek.\n\nSialpore, however, was much more taken up with preparations for the\ncolossal coronation-wedding feast than with Samson's digging.  Yasmini\nwent on her palace roof each day to see how the trees leaned this and\nthat way, as the earth was mined from under them.  And Tom Tripe,\nstanding guard on the bastion of the fort to oversee the removal of\ncertain stores and fittings before the English should march out finally\nand the maharajah's men march in, could see the destruction of the\npipal trees too.  So, for that matter, could Dick Blaine, on the day when\nhe took some of the gang and blocked up the mouth of the mine on\nthe hill with cemented masonry--to prevent theft;  and cursed himself\nafterward for being such a fool as to brick up his luncheon basket inside\nthe tunnel, to say nothing of all the men's water bottles and some of\ntheir food and tools.  But nobody else in Sialpore took very much notice\nof Samson's excavation, and nobody cared about Dick's mine.\n\nEvery maharajah always tries to make his wedding and coronation\nceremonies grander, and more extravagant and memorable than\nanybody's else have been since history began;  and there are plenty\nwhose interest it is to encourage him, and to help him do it;  money-lenders,\nfor instance.  But Utirupa not only had two magnificent ceremonies to\nunite in one, but Yasmini to supply the genius.  The preparations made\nthe very priests gasp (and they were used to orgies of extravagance--\ntaught and preached and profited by them in fact.)\n\nOnce or twice Tess remonstrated, but Yasmini turned a scornfully deaf ear.\n\n\"What would you have us do instead?  Invest all the money at eight\nper cent., so that the rich traders may have more capital, and found\nan asylum where Bimbu, Umra and Pinga may live in idleness and be\nrebuked for mirth?\"\n\n\"Bimbu, Umra and Pinga might be put to work,\" said Tess.  \"As for\nmirth, they laugh at such unseemly things.  They could be taught what\nproper humor is.\"\n\n\"Have they not worked?\" Yasmini asked.  \"Has one man got into your\nhouse, without you, or the guard set to watch you, knowing it?  Could\nany one have done it better?  Did it not have to be done?  As for humor--\nhave they not enjoyed the task?  Has it not been a sweeter tale in their\nears than the story-teller's at the corner, because they have told it to\nthemselves and acted a part in it?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Tess, \"you can't convince me!  There are institutions that\ncould be founded with all that money you and your husband are going\nto spend on ceremony, that would do good.\"\n\n\"Institutions?\"  Yasmini's eyes grew ablaze with blue indignant fire.\n\"There were institutions in this land before the English came, which\nneed attention before we worry ourselves over new ones.  Play was\none of them, and I will revive it first!  The people used to dance under\nthe trees by moonlight.  Do they do it now?  It is true they used to die\nof famine in the bad years, growing much too fat in good ones, and the\nEnglish have changed that.  But I will give them back the gladness, if I\ncan, that has been squeezed out by too many 'institutions!' \"\n\n\"You would rather see Bimbu, Umra and Pinga happy, than prosperous\nand well-clothed?\"\n\n\"Which would you rather?\" Yasmini asked her.  \"You shall see them\nwell clothed in a little while.  Just wait.\"\n\nThere were almost endless altercations with the priests.  Utirupa himself\nwas known to have profound Sikh tendencies--a form of liberalism in\nreligion that produced almost as much persecution at one time as\nProtestantism did in Europe.  To marry a woman openly who had no\ntrue claim to caste at all, as Yasmini, being the daughter of a foreigner,\nhad not, was in the eyes of the priests almost as great an offense as\nYasmini's father's, who crossed the kali pani (ocean) and married\nabroad in defiance of them.  So the priests demanded the most elaborate\nritual of purification that ingenuity could devise, together with staggering\nsums of money.  Utirupa's eventual threat to lead a reform movement\nin Rajputana brought them to see reason, however, and they eventually\ncompromised, with a stipulation that the public should not be told how\nmuch had been omitted.\n\nThere was feasting in the streets for a week before the great inauguration\nceremony.  Tables were set in every side-street, where whoever cared\nto might eat his fill of fabulous free rations.  Each night the streets were\nilluminated with colored lights, and fireworks blazed and roared against\nthe velvet sky at intervals, dowering the ancient trees and temple-tops\nwith momentary splendor.\n\nAll day long there were performances by acrobats, and songs, and\nstory-telling whenever there was room for a crowd to gather.  Faquirs\nas gruesome and fantastic as the side-shows at a Western fair flocked\nin to pose and be gaped at, receiving, besides free rations and tribute\nof small coin, gratification to their vanity in return for the edifying spectacle.\n\nThere were little processions, too, of princes arriving from a distance\nto be present on the great day, their elephants of state loaded with\nextravagant gifts and their retainers vying with peacocks in efforts to\nlook splendid, and be arrogant, and claim importance for their masters.\nNever a day but three or four or half-a-dozen noble guests arrived;\nand nobody worked except those who had to make things easy for\nthe rest;  and they worked overtime.\n\nOne accustomed spectacle, however, was omitted.  Utirupa would\nhave none of the fights between wild animals in the arena that had\nformed such a large part of Gungadhura's public amusement.  But\nthere was ram-fighting, and wrestling between men such as Sialpore\nhad never seen, all the best wrestlers from distant parts being there\nto strive for prizes.  Hired dancers added to the gaiety at night, and\neach incoming nobleman brought nautch girls, or acrobats, or trained\nanimals, or all three to add to the revelry.  And there was cock-fighting,\nand quail-fighting, of course, all day long and every day, with gambling\nin proportion.\n\nWhen the day of days at last arrived the city seemed full of elephants.\nEvery compound and available walled space had been requisitioned\nto accommodate the brutes, and there were sufficient argumentative\nmahouts, all insisting that their elephants had not enough to eat, and\nall selling at least half of the pr-vided ration, to have formed a good-sized\nregiment.  The elephants' daily bath in the river was a sight worth crossing\nIndia to see.  There was always the chance, besides, that somebody's\nhorses would take fright and add excitement to the spectacle.\n\nUp in the great palace Utirupa feasted and entertained his equals all\nday long, and most of the night.  There was horse-racing that brought\nthe crowd out in its thousands, and a certain amount of tent-pegging\nand polo, but most of the royal gala-making was hidden from public view.\n(Patali, for instance, reckless of Gungadhura's fall and looking for new\nfields to conquer, provided a nautch by herself and her own trained\ngalaxy of girls that would not have done at all in public.)\n\nYasmini kept close in her own palace.  She, too, had her hands full\nwith entertaining, for there were about a dozen of the wives of distant\nprinces who had made the journey in state to attend the ceremony and\nwatch it from behind the durbar grille--to say nothing of the wives of\nlocal magnates.  But she herself kept within doors, until the night before\nthe night of full moon, the day before the ceremony.\n\nThat night she dressed as a rangar once more, and rode in company\nwith Tess and Dick, with Ismail the Afridi running like a dog in the shadows\nbehind them, to the fort on the hill that the English had promised to\nevacuate that night.  They never changed the garrison in any case\nexcept by night, because of the heat and the long march for the men;\nand as near the full moon as possible was the customary date.\n\nAs they neared the fort they could see Tom Tripe, with his huge dog\nsilhouetted on the bastion beside him, standing like Napoleon on the\nseashore keeping vigil.  From that height he could oversee the blocked-up\nmouth of Dick's mine, and in the bright moonlight it would have been\ndifficult for any one to approach either mine or fort without detection;\nfor there was only one road, and Dick's track making a detour from it--\nboth in full view.\n\nHe caught sight of them, and Dick whistled, the dog answering with a\ncavernous howl of recognition.  Tom disappeared from the bastion,\nand after about ten minutes turned up in the shadow where they waited.\n\n\"Come to watch the old march out and the new march in?\" he asked.\n\"I'll stand here with you, if I may.  They're due.\"\n\n\"Is everything ready?\" asked Yasmini.\n\n\"Yes, Your Ladyship.  They've been ready for an hour, and fretful.\nThere's a story gone the rounds that the fort is haunted, and if ever a\ngarrison was glad to quit it's this one!  Let's hope the incoming garrison\ndon't get wind of it.  A Sepoy with the creeps ain't dependable.  Hullo,\nhere they come!\"\n\nThere came a sound of steady tramping up-hill, and a bugle somewhere\nup in the darkness announced that the out-going garrison had heard it\nand were standing to arms.  Presently Utirupa rode into view accompanied\nby half a dozen of his guests, and followed by a company from his own\narmy, officered by Rajputs.  If he knew that Yasmini was watching from\nthe shadow he made no sign, but rode straight on up-hill.  The heavy\nbreathing of his men sounded through the darkness like the whispering\nof giants, and their steady tramp was like a giant's footfall;  for Tom\nTripe had drilled them thoroughly, even if their weapons were nearly\nas old-fashioned as the fort to which they marched.\n\nAfter an interminable interval there came another bugle-blast above\nthem, and the departing garrison tramped within ear-shot.\n\n\"Now count them!\" Yasmini whispered, and Tess wondered why.\n\nThey were marching down-hill as fast as they could swing--a detachment\nof Punjabi infantry under the command of a native subahdar, with two\nammunition mules and a cartful of their kits and personal belongings--\nall talking and laughing as if regret were the last thing in their minds.\n\n\"Ninety-seven,\" said Tess, when the last had passed down-hill.\n\n\"Did you count the man beside the driver on the cart?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"There was one sick man in a dhoolie.  Did you count him?\"\n\n\"NO.\"\n\n\"Ninety-eight, them Tom!\"\n\n\"Your Ladyship?\"\n\n\"Weren't there some English officers?\"\n\n\"Two.  A captain and a subaltern.  They left late this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Making?\" said Yasmini.\n\n\"Exactly a hundred,\" answered Tess.\n\n\"Let us go now,\" said Yasmini.  \"We must be up at dawn for the great\nday.  I shall expect you very early, remember.  Tom!  You may ride\nback with us.  His highness will mount the guard in person.  You're to\ncome to my palace.  I've a present waiting for you.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twenty-Three\n\n\n\n\nIt is better to celebrate the occasion than to annoy the gods with\npretended virtue and too many promises.  --Eastern Proverb\n\nThree amber moons in a purple sky.\n\nThe day of the great inauguration ceremony dawned inauspiciously\nfor somebody.  For one thing, the blasting powder laid ready by the\nsappers under\nthe pipal trees for explosion the day following, blew up prematurely.\nSome idiot had left a kerosene lamp burning in the dug-out, probably,\nand a rat upset it;  or some other of the million possibilities took place.\nNobody was killed, but a dozen pipal trees were blown to smithereens,\nand the ghastly fact laid bare for all to see that in the irregular chasm\nthat remained there was not a symptom of the treasure--as Samson\nwas immediately notified.\n\nSo Samson had to attend the ceremony with that disconcerting knowledge\nup his sleeve.  But that was not all.  The night signaler, going off duty,\nhad brought him a telegram from the high commissioner to say that\nall available military bands were to be lent for the day to the maharajah,\nand that as many British officers as possible, of all ranks, were to take\npart in the procession to grace it with official sanctity.\n\nThat was especially aggravating because it had reached his ears that\nthe Princess Yasmini intended to ride veiled in the procession, and\nto sit beside her husband in the durbar hall unveiled.  He was therefore\ngoing to be obliged to recognize her more or less officially as consort\nof the reigning prince.  Simla did not realize that, of course;  but it was\ntoo late to wire for different instructions.  He had a grim foreboding that\nhe himself would catch it later on when the facts leaked out, as they\nwere bound to do.\n\n(It was babu Sita Ram who \"caught it\" first, though.  Within two days\nSamson discovered that Sita Ram had been sending official telegrams\nin code on his own account, very cleverly designed to cause the high\ncommissioner to give those last minute instructions.  It was obvious\nthat a keener wit than the babu's had inspired him;  but, though he was\nbrow-beaten for an hour he did not implicate Yasmini.  And after he\nhad been dismissed from the service with ignominy she engaged him\nas a sort of secretary, at the same pay.)\n\nBut that was not all, either.  The murderer of Mukhum Dass was refusing\nstolidly to plead guilty to another charge, and Blaine's butler had come\nout with the whole story of the burglary.  Parliament would get to hear\nabout it next, and then there would be the very deuce to pay.  The police\nwere offering the murderer what they called \"inducements and persuasion\";\nbut he held out for \"money down,\" and did not seem to find too unendurable\nwhatever it was that happened to him at intervals in the dark cell.  There\nare limits even to what an Indian policeman can do, without making marks\non a man or compelling the attention of European officers.\n\nOn top of all that, Samson had to hand Dick Blaine a check amounting\nto a month's pay, look pleasant while he did it, and--above all--look\npleasant at the coming durbar.\n\nOn the other hand, there were people who enjoyed themselves.  Sialpore,\nacross the river, was a dinning riot of excitement--flags, triumphal arches,\ngala clothes and laughter everywhere.  Dick Blaine, driving Tess toward\nYasmini's palace in the very early dawn, had to drive slowly to avoid\naccident, for the streets were already crowded.  His own place in the\nprocession was to be on horseback pretty nearly anywhere he chose\nto insert himself behind the royal cortege, and, not being troubled on\nthe score of precedence, he had Tom Tripe in mind as a good man\nto ride with.  Tom could tell him things.\n\nBut he waited there for more than an hour until the royal elephants arrived,\nmagnificent in silver howdahs and bright paint, and watched Tess emerge\nwith Yasmini and the other women.  Tess wore borrowed jewels, and\na veil that you could see her face through;  but Yasmini was draped\nfrom head to foot as if the eyes of masculinity had never rested on her,\nand never might.  Things were not going quite so smoothly as they ought,\nalthough Tom Tripe was galloping everywhere red-necked with energy,\nand it was nearly half an hour more before the escort of maharajah's\ntroops came in brand-new scarlet uniforms, to march in front, and behind,\nand on each side of the elephants.  So Dick got quite a chance to \"josh\"\nTess, and made the most of it.\n\nBut things got under way at last.  Dick's sais found him with the horse\nhe was to ride, and the procession gathered first on the great maidan\n(open ground) between the city and the river, with bands in full blast,\ndrums thundering to split the ears, masters of ceremony shouting, and\nthe elephants enjoying themselves most of all, as they always do when\nthey have a stately part to play in company.\n\nUtirupa led the way in a golden howdah on Akbar, the biggest elephant\nin captivity and the very archetype of sobriety ever since his escapade\nwith Tom Tripe's rum.  Akbar was painted all over with vermilion and\nblue decorations, and looked as if butter would not melt in his mouth.\n\nNext after Utirupa the princes rode in proper order of rank and precedence,\neach with two attendants up behind him waving fans of ostrich plumes.\nThen came a band.  Then Samson, and a score of British officers in\ncarriages whose teams were nearly frantic from the din and the smell\nof elephants and had to have runners to hold their heads--all of which\nadded exquisite amusement.  Then another band, and a column of the\nmaharajah's troops.  Then more elephants, loaded with the lesser notables;\nand after them, a column nearly a mile long of Rajput gentry on the\nmost magnificent horses they could discover and go in debt for.\n\nAfter the Rajput gentry came a third band, followed by more maharajah's\ntroops, and then Yasmini on her elephant, followed by twenty princesses\nand Tess, each with a great beast to herself and at least two maids to\nwave the jeweled fans.  Then more troops, followed by Dick and Tom Tripe\ntogether on horseback leading the rank and file.  Trotters jogged along\nbetween Tom and Dick, pausing at intervals to struggle with both forefeet\nto remove a collar bossed with solid gold that he regarded as an outrage\nto his dogly dignity.\n\nAnd the rank and file were well worth looking at, for whoever could find\na decent suit of clothes was marching, shouting, laughing, sweating,\nkicking up the dust, and having a good time generally.  The water-sellers\nwere garnering a harvest;  fruit- and sweetmeat-peddlers were dreaming\nof open-fronted shops and how to defeat the tax-collector.  The police\nswaggered and yelled and ordered everybody this and that way;  and\nnobody took the slightest notice;  and the policemen did not dare do\nanything about it because the crowd was too unanimously bent on having\nits own way, and therefore dangerous to bully but harmless if not hit.\n\nHalf-way down the thronging stream of men on foot came another elephant--\na little one, alone, carrying three gentlemen in fine white raiment--Bimbu\nand Pinga and Umra to wit, who, it is regrettable to chronicle, were very\ndrunk indeed and laughed exceedingly at most unseemly jokes, exchanging\njests with the crowd that would have made Tess's hair stand on end,\nif she could have heard and understood them.  From windows, and\nroofs that overhung the street, people threw flowers at Bimbu, Pinga\nand Umra, because all Hindustan knows there is merit in treating beggars\nas if they were noblemen;  and Bimbu wove himself a garland out of\nthe buds to wear on his turban, which made him look more bacchanalian\nthan ever.\n\nIn and out and around and through the ancient city the procession filed,\npassing now and then through streets so narrow that people could have\nstruck Utirupa through the upper story windows;  but all they threw at\nhim was flowers, calling him \"Bahadur\" and king of elephants, and great\nprince, and dozens of other names that never hurt anybody with a sense\nof pageantry and humor.  He acted the part for them just as they wanted\nhim to, sitting bolt upright in the howdah like a prince in a fairy story,\nwith jeweled aigrette in his turban and more enormous diamonds flashing\non his silken clothes than a courtesan would wear at Monte Carlo.\nAnd all the other princes were likewise in degree, only that they rode\nrather smaller elephants, Akbar having no peer when he was sober\nand behaved himself.\n\nAnd when Yasmini passed, and Tess and all the other princesses, there\nwas such excitement as surely had never been before;  for if you looked\ncarefully, with a hand held to keep the sun from your eyes, you could\nactually see the outlines of their faces through the veils!  And such\nloveliness!  Such splendor!  Such pride!  Such jewels!  Above all, such\nfathomless mystery and suggestion of intrigue!  Pageantry is expensive,\nbut--believe Sialpore--it is worth the price!\n\nAnd then in front of the durbar hall in the dinning, throbbing heat, all the\nanimals and carriages and men got mixed in a milling vortex, while the\nnotables went into the hall to be jealous of one another's better places\nand left the crowd outside to sort itself.  And everything was made much\nmore interesting by the fact that Akbar was showing signs of ill-temper,\nthrowing up his great trunk once or twice to trumpet dissatisfaction.\nHis mahout was calling him endearing names and using the ankus alternately,\npromising him rum with one breath and a thrashing with the next.  But\nAkbar wanted alcohol, not promises, and none dared give him any before\nevening, when he might get as drunk as he wished in a stone-walled\ncompound all to himself.\n\nThen Samson's horses took fright at Akbar's trumpeting, he getting out\nof the carriage at the durbar door only in the nick to time.  The horses\nbolted into the crowd, and an indignant elephant smashed the carriage;\nbut nobody was hurt beyond a bruise or two, although they passed\nword down the thunderous line that a hundred and six and thirty had\nbeen crushed to death and one child injured, which made it much more\nthrilling, and the sensation was just as actual as if the deaths had\nreally happened.\n\nAnd inside the durbar hall there was surely never such a splendid scene\nin history--such a sea of turbans--such glittering of jewels--such a\npeacocking and swaggering and proud bearing of ancient names!  Utirtipa\nsat on the throne in front of a peacock-feather decoration;  and-marvel\nof marvels!--Yasmini sat on another throne beside him, unveiled!--with\na genuine unveiled and very beautiful princess beside her, whom nobody\nexcept Samson suspected might be Tess.  She wore almost as many\njewels as the queen herself, and looked almost as ravishing.\n\nBut the Princess Yasmini's eyes--they were the glory of that occasion!\nHer spun-gold hair was marveled at, but her eyes--surely they were lent\nby a god for the event!  They were bluer than the water of Himalayan\nlakes;  bluer than turquoise, sapphire, the sky, or any other blue thing\nyou can think of--laughing blue,--loving, understanding, likable, amusing\nblue--two jewels that outshone all the other jewels in the durbar hall that day.\n\nAnd as each prince filed past Utirupa in proper order of precedence,\nto make a polite set speech, and bow, and be bowed to in return, he\nhad to pass Yasmini first, and bow to her first, although he made his\nspeech to Utirupa, who acknowledged it.  So, when Samson's turn\ncame, he, too, had to bow first to Yasmini, because as a gentleman\nhe could hardly do less;  and her wonderful eyes laughed into his angry\nones as she bowed to him in return, with such good humor and elation\nthat he could not help but smile back;  he could forgive a lovely woman\nalmost anything, could Samson.  He could almost forgive her that no\nless than nineteen British officers of various ranks, as well as\none-hundred-and-three-and-twenty native noblemen had seen him\nwith their own eyes to make an official bow to the consort of a reigning\nmaharajah.  He had recognized her officially!  Well;  he supposed he\ncould eat his aftermath as well as any man;  and he drove home with\na smile and a high chin, to unbosom himself to Colonel Willoughby\nde Wing over a whisky and soda at the club, as Ferdinand de Sousa\nBraganza reported in some detail at the Goanese Club afterward.\n\nLate that night, when the fireworks were all over and the lights were\nbeginning to be extinguished on the roofs and windows, it was a question\nwhich was most drunk--Akbar, the three beggars, or Tom Tripe.  Akbar's\noutrageous trumpeting could be heard all over the city, as he raced\naround his dark compound after shadows, and rats, and mice and anything\nelse that he imagined or could see.  What Tom Tripe saw kept him to\nhis quarters, where Trotters watched him in dire misery.  The three beggars,\nBimbu, Pinga and Umra, saw three amber moons in a purple sky, for\nthey said so.  They also said that all the world was lovely, and Yasmini\nwas a queen of queens, out of whose jeweled hand the very gods ate.\nAnd when people scolded them for blasphemy, they made such\noutrageously funny and improper jokes that everybody laughed again.\n\nDrunk or sober (and more than ninety-nine per cent. of Sialpore was\nabsolutely sober then as always) every one had something to amuse\nand entertain, except Samson, whose mental vision was of a great\nempty hole in the ground in which he might just as well bury all his hopes\nof ever being high commissioner;  and poor Tom Tripe, who had worked\nharder than anybody, and was now enjoying the aftermath perhaps least.\n\nSialpore put itself to bed in great good temper, sure that princes and\nelephants and ceremony were the cream of life, and that whoever did\nnot think so did not deserve to have any pageantry and pomp, and that\nwas all about it.\n\nNext morning early, Dick Blaine drove down to look for Tom Tripe, found\nhim--bound him in a blanket--shoved him, feet first, on to the floor of\nthe dog-cart, and drove him, followed by Trotters in doubt whether to\nshow approval or fight, to his own house on the hill, where Tess and\nhe nursed the old soldier back to soberness and old remorse.\n\nBy that time Bimbu and Pinga and Umra were back again at the garden\ngate, sitting in the dust in ancient rags and whining, \"Bhig mangi, saheebi!\"\n\"Alms! heavenborn, alms!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twenty-Four\n\n\n\n\n\"You are a fool,\" said the crow.  \"Am I?\" the hen answered.  \"Certainly\nyou are a fool.  You sit in a dark corner hatching eggs, when there\nare live chickens for the asking over yonder.\"  So the hen left her\nnest in search of ready-made chickens, and the crow, made a square\nmeat.  --Eastern Proverb\n\n\nA hundred guarded it.\n\nIt began to be rumored presently that Utirupa had declined to recognize\nBlaine's contract with his predecessor.  Samson's guarded hints, and\nthe fact that the mouth of the mine remained blocked with concrete\nmasonry were more or less corroborative.  But the Blaines did not go,\nalthough Dick put in no appearance at the club.\n\nThen Patali, who was sedulously cultivating Yasmini's patronage, with\nulterior designs on Utirupa that were not misunderstood, told Norwood's\nwife's ayah's sister's husband that the American had secured another\ncontract;  and the news, of course, reached Samson's ears at once.\n\nSo Samson called on Utirupa and requested explanations.  He was told\nthat the mining contract had not received a moment's consideration\nand, with equal truth, that the American, being an expert in such matters\nand on the spot, had been asked to undertake examination of the fort's\nfoundations.  The new maharanee, it seemed, had a fancy to build a\npalace where the fort stood, and the matter was receiving shrewd\ninvestigation and estimate in advance.\n\nSamson could not object to that.  Those foundations had not been\nexamined carefully for eight hundred years.  A perfectly good palace\nhad been wrested away by diplomatic means, on Samson's own initiative,\nand there was no logical reason why the maharajah should not build\nanother one to replace it.  The fort had no modern military value.\n\n\"I hope you're not going to try to pay for your new palace out of taxes?\"\nSamson asked bluntly.\n\nBut Utirupa smiled.  He hoped nothing of that kind would be necessary.\nSamson could not go and investigate what Blaine was doing, because\nhe was given plainly to understand that the new palace was the maharanee's\nbusiness;  and one does not intrude uninvited into the affairs of ladies\nin the East.  The efforts of quite a number of spies, too, were unavailing.\nSo Dick had his days pretty much to himself, except when Tess brought\nhis lunch to him, or Yasmini herself in boots and turban rode up for a\nfew minutes to look on.  The guards on the bastions, and in the great\nkeep in the center, knew nothing whatever of what was happening, because\nall Dick's activity was underground and Tom Tripe, with that ferocious\ndog of his, kept guard over the ancient door that led to the lower passages.\nDick used to return home every evening tired out, but Tom Tripe, keeping\nstrictly sober, slept in the fort and said nothing of importance to any\none.  He looked drawn and nervous, as if something had terrified him,\nbut public opinion ascribed that to the \"snakes\" on the night of the coronation.\n\nThen about sundown one evening Tom Tripe galloped in a great hurry\nto Utirupa's palace.  That was nothing to excite comment, because in\nhis official capacity he was always supposed to be galloping all over\nthe place on some errand or another.  But after dark Utirupa and Yasmini\nrode out of the palace unattended, which did cause comment, Yasmini\nin man's clothes, as usual when she went on some adventure.  It was\nnot seen which road they took, which was fortunate in the circumstances.\n\nTess was up at the fort before them, waiting with Dick outside the locked\ndoor leading to the ancient passages below.  They said nothing beyond\nthe most perfunctory greetings, but, each taking a kerosene lantern,\npassed through the door in single file, Tom leading, and locked the\ndoor after them.  That was all that the fort guards ever knew about\nwhat happened.\n\n\"I've not been in,\" said Dick's voice from behind them.  \"All I've done\nis force an entrance.\"\n\nFrom in front Tom Tripe took up the burden.\n\n\"And I wouldn't have liked your job, sir!  It was bad enough to sit and\nguard the door.  After you'd gone o' nights I'd sit for hours with my hair\non end, listening;  and the dog 'ud growl beside me as if he saw ghosts!\"\n\n\"Maybe it was snakes,\" Yasmini answered.  \"They will flee from the\nlantern-light--\"\n\n\"No, Your Ladyship.  I'm not afraid of snakes--except them Scotch\nplaid ones that come o' brandy on top o' royal durbars!  This was the\nsound o' some one digging--digging all night long down in the bowels\nof the earth!  Look out!\"\n\nThey all jumped, but it proved to be only Tom's own shadow that had\nfrightened him.  His nerves were all to pieces, and Dick Blaine took the\nlead.  The dog was growling intermittently and keeping close to Tom's heels.\n\nThey passed down a long spiral flight of stone steps into a sort of cavern\nthat had been used for ammunition room.  The departing British troops\nhad left a dozen ancient cannon balls, not all of which were in one place.\nThe smooth flags of the floor were broken, and at the far end one very\nheavy stone was lifted and laid back, disclosing a dark hole.\n\n\"I used the cannon balls,\" said Dick, \"to drop on the stones and listen\nfor a hollow noise.  Once I found that, the game was simple.\"\n\nLeading down into the dark hole were twelve more steps, descending\nstraight, but turning sharply at the bottom.  Dick led the way.\n\n\"The next sight's gruesome!\" he announced, his voice booming hollow\namong the shadows.\n\nThe passage turned into a lofty chamber in the rock, whose walls once\nhad all been lined with dressed stone, but some of the lining had fallen.\nIn the shadows at one end an image of Jinendra smiled complacently,\nand there were some ancient brass lamps banging on chains from arches\ncut into the rock on every side.\n\n\"This is the grue,\" said Dick, holding his lantern high.\n\nIts light fell on a circle of skeletons, all perfect, each with its head toward\na brass bowl in the center.\n\n\"Ugh!\" growled Tom Tripe.  \"Those are the ghosts that dig o' nights!\nGo smell 'em, Trotters!  Are they the enemy?\"\n\nThe dog sniffed the bones, but slunk away again uninterested.\n\n\"Nothing doing!\" laughed Dick.  \"You haven't laid the ghost yet, Tom!\"\n\n\"Have you got your pistols with you?\" Tom retorted, patting his own\njacket to show the bulge of one beneath it.\n\n\"Those,\" said Yasmini, standing between the skeletons and holding\nup her own light, \"are the bones of priests, who died when the secret\nof the place was taken from them!  My father told me they were left to\nstarve to death.  This was Jinendra's temple.\"\n\n\"D'you suppose they pulled that cut stone from the walls, trying to force\na way out?\" Dick hazarded.  \"The lid of the hole we came down through\nis a foot thick, and was set solid in cement;  they couldn't have lifted\nthat if they tried for a week.  Everything's solid in this place.  I sounded\nevery inch of the floor with a cannon ball, but it's all hard underneath.\"\n\n\"I would have gone straight to the image of Jinendra,\" said Yasmini.\n\"Jinendra smiles and keeps his secrets so well that I should have\nsuspected him at once!\"\n\n\"I went to that last,\" Dick answered.  \"It looks so like a piece of high\nrelief carved out of the rock wall.  As a matter of fact, though, it's about\nsix tons of quartz with a vein of gold in it--see the gold running straight\nup the line of the nose and over the middle of the head?--I pried it away\nfrom the wall at last with steel wedges, and there's just room to squeeze\nin behind it.  Beyond that is another wall that I had to cut through with\na chisel.  Who goes in first?\"\n\n\"Who looks for gold finds gold!\" Yasmini quoted.  \"The vein of gold\nyou have been mining was the clue to the secret all along.\"\n\nShe would have led the way, but Utirupa stopped her.\n\n\"If there is danger,\" he said, \"it is my place to lead.\"\n\nBut nobody would permit that, Yasmini least of all.\n\n\"Shall Samson choose a new maharajah so soon as all that?\" she laughed.\n\n\"Let the dog go first!\" Tom proposed.  Trotters was sniffing at the dark\ngap behind Jinendra's image, with eyes glaring and a low rumbling\ngrowl issuing from between bared teeth.  But Trotters would not go.\n\nFinally, in the teeth of remonstrances from Tess, Dick cocked a pistol\nand, with his lantern in the other hand, strode in boldly.  Trotters followed\nhim, and Tom Tripe next.  Then Utirupa.  Then the women.\n\nNothing happened.  The passage was about ten feet long and a yard\nwide. They squeezed one at a time through the narrow break Dick had\nmade in the end of it, into a high, pitch-dark cave that smelt unexplainably\nof wood-smoke, Dick standing just inside the gap to bold the lantern\nfor them and help them through--continuing to stand there after Tess\nhad entered last.\n\n\"Jee-rusalem!\" he exclaimed.  \"This is where I lose out!\"\n\nThe first glance was enough to show that they stood in the secret\ntreasure-vault of Sialpore.  There were ancient gold coins in heaps on the\nfloor where they had burst by their own weight out of long-demolished bags--\ncountless coins;  and drums and bags and boxes more of them behind.\nBut what made Dick exclaim were the bars of silver stacked at the rear\nand along one side in rows as high as a man.\n\n\"My contract reads gold!\" he said.  \"A percentage of all gold.  There's\nnot a word in it of silver.  Who'd ever have thought of finding silver,\nanyhow, in this old mountain?\"\n\n\"Your percentage of the gold will make you rich,\" said Utirupa.  \"But\nyou shall take silver too.  Without you we might have found nothing for\nyears to come.\"\n\n\"A contract's a contract,\" Dick answered.  \"I drew it myself, and it stands.\"\n\n\"Look out!\" yelled Tom Tripe suddenly.  But the warning came too late.\n\nOut of the shadow behind a stack of silver bars rushed a man with a\nlong dagger, stabbing frantically at Dick.  Tom's great barking army\nrevolver missed, filling the chamber with noise and smoke, for he used\nblack powder.\n\nDown went Dick under his assailant, and the dagger rose and fell in\nspasmodic jerks.  Dick had hold of the man's wrist, but the dagger-point\ndripped blood and the fury of the attack increased as Dick appeared\nto weaken.  Utirupa ran in to drag the assailant off, but Trotters got there\nfirst--chose his neck-hold like a wolf in battle--and in another second\nDick was free with Tess kneeling beside him while a life-and-death fight\nbetween animal and man raged between the bars of silver.\n\n\"Gungadhura!\" Yasmini shouted, waving her lantern for a sight of the\nstruggling man's face.  He was lashing out savagely with the long knife, but\nthe dog had him by the neck from behind, and he only inflicted surface wounds.\n\n\"Hell's bells!  He'll kill my dog!\" roared Tom.  \"Hi, Trotters.  Here,\nyou--Trotters!\"\n\nBut the dog took that for a call to do his thinking,  and let go for a better\nhold.  His long fangs closed again on the victim's jugular, and tore it out.\nThe long knife clattered on the stone floor, and then Tom got his dog\nby the jaws and hauled him off.\n\n\"You can't blame the dog,\" he grumbled.  \"He knew the smell of him.\nHe'd been told to kill him if he got the chance.\"\n\n\"Gungadhura!\" said Yasmini again, holding her lantern over the dying man.\n\"So Gungadhura was Tom Tripe's ghost!  What a pity that the dog should\nkill him, when all he wanted was a battle to the death with me!  I would\nhave given him his fight!\"\n\nDick was in no bad way.  He had three flesh wounds on his right side,\nand none of them serious.  Tess staunched them with torn linen, and\nshe and Tom Tripe propped him against some bags of bullion, while\nUtirupa threw his cloak over Gungadhura's dead body.\n\n\"How did Gungadhura get in here?\" wondered Tess.\n\n\"Through the hole at the end of the mine-shaft, I suppose,\" said Dick.\n\"I built up the lower one--he came one day and saw me doing it--but\nleft a space at the top that looked too small for a man to crawl through.\nThen I blocked the mouth of the tunnel afterward, and shut him in, I suppose.\nHe's had the men's rice and water-bottles, and they left a lot of faggots\nin the tunnel, too, I remember.  That accounts for the smell of smoke.\"\n\n\"But what was the digging I've heard o' nights?\" demanded Tom.  \"I'm\nnot the only one.  The British garrison was scared out of its wits.\"\n\nUtirupa was hunting about with a lantern in his hand, watching the dog\ngo sniffing in the shadows.\n\n\"Come and see what he has done!\" he called suddenly, and Yasmini\nran to his side.\n\nIn a corner of the vault one of the great facing stones had been removed,\ndisclosing a deep fissure in the rock.  One of Dick Blaine's crow-bars\nthat he had left in the tunnel lay beside it.\n\n\"He must have found that by tapping,\" said Tom Tripe.\n\n\"Yes, but look why he wanted it!\" Yasmini answered.  \"Tom, could you\nbe as malicious as that?\"\n\n\"As what, Your Ladyship?\"\n\n\"See, he has poured gold into the fissure, hoping to close it up again\nso that nobody could find it!\"\n\n\"But why didn't he work his way out with the crow-bar?\" Dick objected\nfrom his perch between the bags of bullion.\n\n\"What was his life worth to him outside?\" Yasmini asked.  \"Samson knew\nwho murdered Mukhum Dass.  He would have been a prisoner for the\nrest of his life to all intents and purposes.  No!  He preferred to hide\nthe treasure again, and then wait here for me, suspecting that I knew\nwhere it is and would come for it!  Only we came too soon, before he\nhad it hidden!\"\n\nBut it was Patali afterward, between boasting and confession, who\nexplained that Dick was Gungadhura's real objective after all.  He\npreferred vengeance on the American even to a settled account with\nYasmini.  He must have found the treasure by accident after crawling\ninto the unsealed crack in the wall to wait there against Dick's coming.\n\n\"The money must stay here, and be removed little by little,\" said Utirupa.\n\n\"First of all Blaine sahib's share of it!\" Yasmini added.  \"Who shall\ncount it?  Who!\"\n\n\"Never mind the money now,\" Tess answered.  \"Dick's alive!  When\ndid you first know you'd found the treasure, Dick?\"\n\n\"Not until the day that Gungadhura found me closing up the fault, and\nasked me to dig at the other place.  The princess told me I was on the\ntrail of it that night that you went with her by camel;  but I didn't know I'd\nfound it till the day that Gungadhura came.\"\n\n\"How did you know where it was?\" Tess asked, and Yasmini laughed.\n\n\"A hundred guarded it.  I looked for a hundred pipal trees, and found\nthem--near the River Palace.  But they were not changed once a month.\nI looked from there, and saw another hundred pipal trees--here, below\nthis fort--exactly a hundred.  But neither were they changed once a month.\nThen I counted the garrison of the fort--exactly a hundred, all told.\nThen I knew.  Then I remembered that 'who looks for gold finds gold,'\nand saw your husband digging for it.  It seemed to me that the vein of\ngold he was following should lead to the treasure, so I pulled strings\nuntil Samson blundered, trying to trick us.  And now we have the treasure,\nand the English do not know.  And I am maharanee, as they do know,\nand shall know still better before I have finished!  But what are we to\ndo with Gungadhura's body?  It shall not lie here to rot;  it must have\na decent burial.\"\n\nVery late that night, Tom Tripe moved the guards about on the bastions,\ncontriving that the road below should not be overlooked by any one.\nThe moon had gone down, so that it was difficult to see ten paces.\nHe produced an ekka from somewhere--one of those two-wheeled\ncarts drawn by one insignificant pony that do most of the unpretentious\nwork of India;  and he and Ismail, the Afridi gateman, drove off into the\ndarkness with a covered load.\n\nEarly next morning Gungadhura's body was found in the great hole that\nSamson's men had blasted in the River Palace grounds, and it was\nsupposed that a jackal had mangled his body after death.\n\n(That was what gave rise to the story that the English got the treasure\nafter all, and that Gungadhura, enraged and mortified at finding it gone,\nhad committed suicide in the great hole it was taken from.  They call\nthe great dead pipal tree that is the only one left now of the hundred,\nGungadhura's gibbet;  and there is quite a number, even of English\npeople, who believe that the Indian Government got the money.  But\nI say no, because Yasmini told me otherwise.  And if it were true that t\nhe English really got the money, what did they do with it and why was\nSamson removed shortly afterward to a much less desirable post?\nAny one could see how Utirupa prospered, and he never raised the\ntaxes half a mill.\n\nSamson had his very shrewd suspicions, one of which was that that\ndamned American with his smart little wife had scored off him in some way.\nBut he went to his new post, at about the same time that the Blaines left\nfor other parts, with some of the sting removed from his hurt feelings.\nFor he took Blaine's rifle with him--a good one;  and the horse and dog-cart,\nand a riding pony--more than a liberal return for payment of a three-\nthousand rupee bet.  Pretty decent of Blaine on the whole, he thought.\nNo fuss.  No argument.  Simply a short note of farewell, and a request\nthat he would \"find the horses a home and a use for the other things.\"\nNot bad.  Not a bad fellow after all.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twenty-Five\n\n\n\n\nL'envoi\n\nDown rings the curtain on a tale of love and mystery,\nClash of guile and anger and the consequence it bore;\nThe adventurers and kings\nDisappear into the wings.\nThe puppet play is over and the pieces go in store.\n\nBack, get ye back again to shop and ship and factory,\nMine and mill and foundry where the iron yokes are made;\nYe have trod a distant track\nWith a queen on camel-back,\nNow hie and hew a broadway for your emperors of trade!\n\nGo, get ye gone again to streets of strife reechoing -\nClangor of the crossings where the tides of trouble meet;\nFor a while on fancy's wing\nYe have heard the nautch-girls sing,\nBut a Great White Way awaits you where the Klax-on-horns repeat.\n\nBack, bend the back again to commonplace and drudgery,\nBeat the shares of vision into swords of dull routine,\nTake the trolley and the train\nTo suburban hives again,\nFor ye wake in little runnels where the floods of thought have been.\n\nSpeed, noise, efficiency!

See--take this.  It is the value, and more, of the percentage\nof the silver that your husband would not take.\"\n\nShe clasped a diamond necklace around Tess's neck, and watched\nit gleam and sparkle in the refracted sunlight.\n\n\"Don't you love it?  Aren't they perfect?  And now--you've a great big\ndraft of money, so I suppose you're both off to America, and good-by\nto me forever?\"\n\n\"For a long time.\"\n\n\"But why such a long time?  You must come again soon.  Come next year.\nYou and I love each other.  You teach me things I did not know, and\nyou never irritate me.  I love you.  You must come back next year!\"\n\nTess shook her head.\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"They say the climate isn't good for them until they're eighteen at least--\nsome say twenty.\"\n\n\"Oh! Oh, I envy you!  What will you call him?  It will be a boy--it is sure\nto be a boy!\"\n\n\"Richard will be one name, after my husband.\"\n\n\"And the other?  You must name him after me in some way.  You can\nnot call a boy Yasmini.  Would Utirupa sound too strange in America?\"\n\n\"Rupert would sound better.\"\n\n\"Good!  He shall be Rupert, and I will send a gift to him!\"\n\n(That accounts for the initials R. R. B. on a certain young man's trunk\nat Yale, and for the imported pedigree horse he rides during vacation--\nthe third one, by the way, of a succession he has received from India.)\n\nAnd that is the whole story, as Yasmini told it to me in the wonderful\nold palace at Buhl, years afterward, when Utirupa was dead, and the\nEnglish Government had sent her into forced seclusion for a while--to\nrepent of her manifold political sins, as they thought--and to start new\nenterprises as it happened.  She had not seen Theresa Blaine again,\nshe told me, although they always corresponded;  and she assured\nme over and over again, calling the painted figures of the old gods\non the walls to witness, that but for Theresa Blaine's companionship\nand affection at the right moment, she would never have had the courage\nto do what she did, even though the guns of the gods were there\nto help her.\n\n\nThe End\n\n\n\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK, GUNS OF THE GODS ***\n\nThis file should be named 5606.txt or 5606.zip\n\nProject Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nWe are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance\nof the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.\nPlease be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,\neven years after the official publication date.\n\nPlease note neither this listing nor its contents are final til\nmidnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.\nThe official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at\nMidnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A\npreliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment\nand editing by those who wish to do so.\n\nMost people start at our Web sites at:\nhttp://gutenberg.net or\nhttp://promo.net/pg\n\nThese Web sites include award-winning information about Project\nGutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new\neBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).\n\n\nThose of you who want to download any eBook before announcement\ncan get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is\nalso a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the\nindexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an\nannouncement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.\n\nhttp://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04 or\nftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04\n\nOr /etext03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90\n\nJust search by the first five letters of the filename you want,\nas it appears in our Newsletters.\n\n\nInformation about Project Gutenberg (one page)\n\nWe produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The\ntime it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours\nto get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\nmillion dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text\nfiles per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+\nWe are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002\nIf they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total\nwill reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.\n\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\nwhich is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.\n\nHere is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):\n\neBooks Year Month\n\n    1  1971 July\n   10  1991 January\n  100  1994 January\n 1000  1997 August\n 1500  1998 October\n 2000  1999 December\n 2500  2000 December\n 3000  2001 November\n 4000  2001 October/November\n 6000  2002 December*\n 9000  2003 November*\n10000  2004 January*\n\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created\nto secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.\n\nWe need your donations more than ever!\n\nAs of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people\nand organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,\nDelaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois,\nIndiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts,\nMichigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New\nHampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio,\nOklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South\nDakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West\nVirginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\n\nWe have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones\nthat have responded.\n\nAs the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list\nwill be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.\nPlease feel free to ask to check the status of your state.\n\nIn answer to various questions we have received on this:\n\nWe are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally\nrequest donations in all 50 states.
