The title\nattracted me; I took them home with me, with the permission of the\nguardian, and devoured them.\n\nIt is not my intention here to enter into an analysis of this curious\nwork; and I shall satisfy myself with referring such of my readers as\nappreciate the pictures of the period to its pages. They will therein\nfind portraits penciled by the hand of a master; and although these\nsquibs may be, for the most part, traced upon the doors of barracks and\nthe walls of cabarets, they will not find the likenesses of Louis XIII,\nAnne of Austria, Richelieu, Mazarin, and the courtiers of the period,\nless faithful than in the history of M. Anquetil.\n\nBut, it is well known, what strikes the capricious mind of the poet is\nnot always what affects the mass of readers. Now, while admiring, as\nothers doubtless will admire, the details we have to relate, our main\npreoccupation concerned a matter to which no one before ourselves had\ngiven a thought.\n\nD'Artagnan relates that on his first visit to M. de Treville, captain\nof the king's Musketeers, he met in the antechamber three young men,\nserving in the illustrious corps into which he was soliciting the honor\nof being received, bearing the names of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.\n\nWe must confess these three strange names struck us; and it immediately\noccurred to us that they were but pseudonyms, under which d'Artagnan had\ndisguised names perhaps illustrious, or else that the bearers of these\nborrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which, from\ncaprice, discontent, or want of fortune, they had donned the simple\nMusketeer's uniform.\n\nFrom the moment we had no rest till we could find some trace in\ncontemporary works of these extraordinary names which had so strongly\nawakened our curiosity.\n\nThe catalogue alone of the books we read with this object would fill\na whole chapter, which, although it might be very instructive, would\ncertainly afford our readers but little amusement. It will suffice,\nthen, to tell them that at the moment at which, discouraged by so many\nfruitless investigations, we were about to abandon our search, we at\nlength found, guided by the counsels of our illustrious friend Paulin\nParis, a manuscript in folio, endorsed 4772 or 4773, we do not recollect\nwhich, having for title, \"Memoirs of the Comte de la Fere, Touching Some\nEvents Which Passed in France Toward the End of the Reign of King Louis\nXIII and the Commencement of the Reign of King Louis XIV.\"\n\nIt may be easily imagined how great was our joy when, in turning over\nthis manuscript, our last hope, we found at the twentieth page the\nname of Athos, at the twenty-seventh the name of Porthos, and at the\nthirty-first the name of Aramis.\n\nThe discovery of a completely unknown manuscript at a period in which\nhistorical science is carried to such a high degree appeared almost\nmiraculous. We hastened, therefore, to obtain permission to print it,\nwith the view of presenting ourselves someday with the pack of others\nat the doors of the Academie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres, if\nwe should not succeed--a very probable thing, by the by--in gaining\nadmission to the Academie Francaise with our own proper pack. This\npermission, we feel bound to say, was graciously granted; which compels\nus here to give a public contradiction to the slanderers who pretend\nthat we live under a government but moderately indulgent to men of\nletters.\n\nNow, this is the first part of this precious manuscript which we offer\nto our readers, restoring it to the title which belongs to it, and\nentering into an engagement that if (of which we have no doubt) this\nfirst part should obtain the success it merits, we will publish the\nsecond immediately.\n\nIn the meanwhile, as the godfather is a second father, we beg the reader\nto lay to our account, and not to that of the Comte de la Fere, the\npleasure or the ENNUI he may experience.\n\nThis being understood, let us proceed with our history.\n\n\n\n\n1 THE THREE PRESENTS OF D'ARTAGNAN THE ELDER\n\nOn the first Monday of the month of April, 1625, the market town of\nMeung, in which the author of ROMANCE OF THE ROSE was born, appeared to\nbe in as perfect a state of revolution as if the Huguenots had just\nmade a second La Rochelle of it. Many citizens, seeing the women flying\ntoward the High Street, leaving their children crying at the open doors,\nhastened to don the cuirass, and supporting their somewhat uncertain\ncourage with a musket or a partisan, directed their steps toward the\nhostelry of the Jolly Miller, before which was gathered, increasing\nevery minute, a compact group, vociferous and full of curiosity.\n\nIn those times panics were common, and few days passed without some city\nor other registering in its archives an event of this kind. There were\nnobles, who made war against each other; there was the king, who made\nwar against the cardinal; there was Spain, which made war against the\nking. Then, in addition to these concealed or public, secret or open\nwars, there were robbers, mendicants, Huguenots, wolves, and scoundrels,\nwho made war upon everybody. The citizens always took up arms readily\nagainst thieves, wolves or scoundrels, often against nobles or\nHuguenots, sometimes against the king, but never against cardinal or\nSpain. It resulted, then, from this habit that on the said first Monday\nof April, 1625, the citizens, on hearing the clamor, and seeing neither\nthe red-and-yellow standard nor the livery of the Duc de Richelieu,\nrushed toward the hostel of the Jolly Miller. When arrived there, the\ncause of the hubbub was apparent to all.\n\nA young man--we can sketch his portrait at a dash. Imagine to yourself a\nDon Quixote of eighteen; a Don Quixote without his corselet, without\nhis coat of mail, without his cuisses; a Don Quixote clothed in a woolen\ndoublet, the blue color of which had faded into a nameless shade between\nlees of wine and a heavenly azure; face long and brown; high cheek\nbones, a sign of sagacity; the maxillary muscles enormously developed,\nan infallible sign by which a Gascon may always be detected, even\nwithout his cap--and our young man wore a cap set off with a sort of\nfeather; the eye open and intelligent; the nose hooked, but finely\nchiseled. Too big for a youth, too small for a grown man, an experienced\neye might have taken him for a farmer's son upon a journey had it not\nbeen for the long sword which, dangling from a leather baldric, hit\nagainst the calves of its owner as he walked, and against the rough side\nof his steed when he was on horseback.\n\nFor our young man had a steed which was the observed of all observers.\nIt was a Bearn pony, from twelve to fourteen years old, yellow in his\nhide, without a hair in his tail, but not without windgalls on his legs,\nwhich, though going with his head lower than his knees, rendering a\nmartingale quite unnecessary, contrived nevertheless to perform his\neight leagues a day. Unfortunately, the qualities of this horse were\nso well concealed under his strange-colored hide and his unaccountable\ngait, that at a time when everybody was a connoisseur in horseflesh, the\nappearance of the aforesaid pony at Meung--which place he had entered\nabout a quarter of an hour before, by the gate of Beaugency--produced an\nunfavorable feeling, which extended to his rider.\n\nAnd this feeling had been more painfully perceived by young\nd'Artagnan--for so was the Don Quixote of this second Rosinante\nnamed--from his not being able to conceal from himself the ridiculous\nappearance that such a steed gave him, good horseman as he was. He had\nsighed deeply, therefore, when accepting the gift of the pony from M.\nd'Artagnan the elder. He was not ignorant that such a beast was worth\nat least twenty livres; and the words which had accompanied the present\nwere above all price.\n\n\"My son,\" said the old Gascon gentleman, in that pure Bearn PATOIS of\nwhich Henry IV could never rid himself, \"this horse was born in the\nhouse of your father about thirteen years ago, and has remained in it\never since, which ought to make you love it. Never sell it; allow it to\ndie tranquilly and honorably of old age, and if you make a campaign with\nit, take as much care of it as you would of an old servant. At court,\nprovided you have ever the honor to go there,\" continued M. d'Artagnan\nthe elder, \"--an honor to which, remember, your ancient nobility gives\nyou the right--sustain worthily your name of gentleman, which has been\nworthily borne by your ancestors for five hundred years, both for your\nown sake and the sake of those who belong to you. By the latter I mean\nyour relatives and friends. Endure nothing from anyone except Monsieur\nthe Cardinal and the king. It is by his courage, please observe, by\nhis courage alone, that a gentleman can make his way nowadays. Whoever\nhesitates for a second perhaps allows the bait to escape which during\nthat exact second fortune held out to him. You are young. You ought to\nbe brave for two reasons: the first is that you are a Gascon, and the\nsecond is that you are my son. Never fear quarrels, but seek adventures.\nI have taught you how to handle a sword; you have thews of iron, a\nwrist of steel. Fight on all occasions. Fight the more for duels\nbeing forbidden, since consequently there is twice as much courage in\nfighting. I have nothing to give you, my son, but fifteen crowns, my\nhorse, and the counsels you have just heard. Your mother will add to\nthem a recipe for a certain balsam, which she had from a Bohemian and\nwhich has the miraculous virtue of curing all wounds that do not reach\nthe heart. Take advantage of all, and live happily and long. I have but\none word to add, and that is to propose an example to you--not mine,\nfor I myself have never appeared at court, and have only taken part in\nreligious wars as a volunteer; I speak of Monsieur de Treville, who\nwas formerly my neighbor, and who had the honor to be, as a child, the\nplay-fellow of our king, Louis XIII, whom God preserve! Sometimes their\nplay degenerated into battles, and in these battles the king was not\nalways the stronger. The blows which he received increased greatly his\nesteem and friendship for Monsieur de Treville. Afterward, Monsieur de\nTreville fought with others: in his first journey to Paris, five times;\nfrom the death of the late king till the young one came of age, without\nreckoning wars and sieges, seven times; and from that date up to the\npresent day, a hundred times, perhaps! So that in spite of edicts,\nordinances, and decrees, there he is, captain of the Musketeers; that\nis to say, chief of a legion of Caesars, whom the king holds in great\nesteem and whom the cardinal dreads--he who dreads nothing, as it is\nsaid. Still further, Monsieur de Treville gains ten thousand crowns a\nyear; he is therefore a great noble. He began as you begin. Go to him\nwith this letter, and make him your model in order that you may do as he\nhas done.\"\n\nUpon which M. d'Artagnan the elder girded his own sword round his son,\nkissed him tenderly on both cheeks, and gave him his benediction.\n\nOn leaving the paternal chamber, the young man found his mother, who\nwas waiting for him with the famous recipe of which the counsels we have\njust repeated would necessitate frequent employment. The adieux were on\nthis side longer and more tender than they had been on the other--not\nthat M. d'Artagnan did not love his son, who was his only offspring, but\nM. d'Artagnan was a man, and he would have considered it unworthy of a\nman to give way to his feelings; whereas Mme. d'Artagnan was a woman,\nand still more, a mother. She wept abundantly; and--let us speak it to\nthe praise of M. d'Artagnan the younger--notwithstanding the efforts he\nmade to remain firm, as a future Musketeer ought, nature prevailed,\nand he shed many tears, of which he succeeded with great difficulty in\nconcealing the half.\n\nThe same day the young man set forward on his journey, furnished with\nthe three paternal gifts, which consisted, as we have said, of fifteen\ncrowns, the horse, and the letter for M. de Treville--the counsels being\nthrown into the bargain.\n\nWith such a VADE MECUM d'Artagnan was morally and physically an exact\ncopy of the hero of Cervantes, to whom we so happily compared him when\nour duty of an historian placed us under the necessity of sketching his\nportrait. Don Quixote took windmills for giants, and sheep for\narmies; d'Artagnan took every smile for an insult, and every look as a\nprovocation--whence it resulted that from Tarbes to Meung his fist was\nconstantly doubled, or his hand on the hilt of his sword; and yet the\nfist did not descend upon any jaw, nor did the sword issue from its\nscabbard. It was not that the sight of the wretched pony did not excite\nnumerous smiles on the countenances of passers-by; but as against the\nside of this pony rattled a sword of respectable length, and as\nover this sword gleamed an eye rather ferocious than haughty, these\npassers-by repressed their hilarity, or if hilarity prevailed over\nprudence, they endeavored to laugh only on one side, like the masks\nof the ancients. D'Artagnan, then, remained majestic and intact in his\nsusceptibility, till he came to this unlucky city of Meung.\n\nBut there, as he was alighting from his horse at the gate of the Jolly\nMiller, without anyone--host, waiter, or hostler--coming to hold his\nstirrup or take his horse, d'Artagnan spied, though an open window on\nthe ground floor, a gentleman, well-made and of good carriage, although\nof rather a stern countenance, talking with two persons who appeared\nto listen to him with respect. d'Artagnan fancied quite naturally,\naccording to his custom, that he must be the object of their\nconversation, and listened. This time d'Artagnan was only in part\nmistaken; he himself was not in question, but his horse was. The\ngentleman appeared to be enumerating all his qualities to his auditors;\nand, as I have said, the auditors seeming to have great deference for\nthe narrator, they every moment burst into fits of laughter. Now, as a\nhalf-smile was sufficient to awaken the irascibility of the young man,\nthe effect produced upon him by this vociferous mirth may be easily\nimagined.\n\nNevertheless, d'Artagnan was desirous of examining the appearance of\nthis impertinent personage who ridiculed him. He fixed his haughty eye\nupon the stranger, and perceived a man of from forty to forty-five years\nof age, with black and piercing eyes, pale complexion, a strongly marked\nnose, and a black and well-shaped mustache. He was dressed in a doublet\nand hose of a violet color, with aiguillettes of the same color, without\nany other ornaments than the customary slashes, through which the\nshirt appeared. This doublet and hose, though new, were creased, like\ntraveling clothes for a long time packed in a portmanteau. d'Artagnan\nmade all these remarks with the rapidity of a most minute observer, and\ndoubtless from an instinctive feeling that this stranger was destined to\nhave a great influence over his future life.\n\nNow, as at the moment in which d'Artagnan fixed his eyes upon the\ngentleman in the violet doublet, the gentleman made one of his most\nknowing and profound remarks respecting the Bearnese pony, his two\nauditors laughed even louder than before, and he himself, though\ncontrary to his custom, allowed a pale smile (if I may allowed to use\nsuch an expression) to stray over his countenance. This time there\ncould be no doubt; d'Artagnan was really insulted. Full, then, of this\nconviction, he pulled his cap down over his eyes, and endeavoring to\ncopy some of the court airs he had picked up in Gascony among young\ntraveling nobles, he advanced with one hand on the hilt of his sword and\nthe other resting on his hip. Unfortunately, as he advanced, his anger\nincreased at every step; and instead of the proper and lofty speech he\nhad prepared as a prelude to his challenge, he found nothing at the\ntip of his tongue but a gross personality, which he accompanied with a\nfurious gesture.\n\n\"I say, sir, you sir, who are hiding yourself behind that shutter--yes,\nyou, sir, tell me what you are laughing at, and we will laugh together!\"\n\nThe gentleman raised his eyes slowly from the nag to his cavalier, as if\nhe required some time to ascertain whether it could be to him that such\nstrange reproaches were addressed; then, when he could not possibly\nentertain any doubt of the matter, his eyebrows slightly bent, and with\nan accent of irony and insolence impossible to be described, he replied\nto d'Artagnan, \"I was not speaking to you, sir.\"\n\n\"But I am speaking to you!\" replied the young man, additionally\nexasperated with this mixture of insolence and good manners, of\npoliteness and scorn.\n\nThe stranger looked at him again with a slight smile, and retiring\nfrom the window, came out of the hostelry with a slow step, and placed\nhimself before the horse, within two paces of d'Artagnan. His quiet\nmanner and the ironical expression of his countenance redoubled the\nmirth of the persons with whom he had been talking, and who still\nremained at the window.\n\nD'Artagnan, seeing him approach, drew his sword a foot out of the\nscabbard.\n\n\"This horse is decidedly, or rather has been in his youth, a buttercup,\"\nresumed the stranger, continuing the remarks he had begun, and\naddressing himself to his auditors at the window, without paying the\nleast attention to the exasperation of d'Artagnan, who, however placed\nhimself between him and them. \"It is a color very well known in botany,\nbut till the present time very rare among horses.\"\n\n\"There are people who laugh at the horse that would not dare to laugh at\nthe master,\" cried the young emulator of the furious Treville.\n\n\"I do not often laugh, sir,\" replied the stranger, \"as you may perceive\nby the expression of my countenance; but nevertheless I retain the\nprivilege of laughing when I please.\"\n\n\"And I,\" cried d'Artagnan, \"will allow no man to laugh when it\ndispleases me!\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir,\" continued the stranger, more calm than ever; \"well, that\nis perfectly right!\" and turning on his heel, was about to re-enter the\nhostelry by the front gate, beneath which d'Artagnan on arriving had\nobserved a saddled horse.\n\nBut, d'Artagnan was not of a character to allow a man to escape him thus\nwho had the insolence to ridicule him. He drew his sword entirely from\nthe scabbard, and followed him, crying, \"Turn, turn, Master Joker, lest\nI strike you behind!\"\n\n\"Strike me!\" said the other, turning on his heels, and surveying the\nyoung man with as much astonishment as contempt. \"Why, my good fellow,\nyou must be mad!\" Then, in a suppressed tone, as if speaking to himself,\n\"This is annoying,\" continued he. \"What a godsend this would be for his\nMajesty, who is seeking everywhere for brave fellows to recruit for his\nMusketeers!\"\n\nHe had scarcely finished, when d'Artagnan made such a furious lunge at\nhim that if he had not sprung nimbly backward, it is probable he would\nhave jested for the last time. The stranger, then perceiving that the\nmatter went beyond raillery, drew his sword, saluted his adversary,\nand seriously placed himself on guard. But at the same moment, his two\nauditors, accompanied by the host, fell upon d'Artagnan with sticks,\nshovels and tongs. This caused so rapid and complete a diversion from\nthe attack that d'Artagnan's adversary, while the latter turned round to\nface this shower of blows, sheathed his sword with the same precision,\nand instead of an actor, which he had nearly been, became a spectator\nof the fight--a part in which he acquitted himself with his usual\nimpassiveness, muttering, nevertheless, \"A plague upon these Gascons!\nReplace him on his orange horse, and let him begone!\"\n\n\"Not before I have killed you, poltroon!\" cried d'Artagnan, making\nthe best face possible, and never retreating one step before his three\nassailants, who continued to shower blows upon him.\n\n\"Another gasconade!\" murmured the gentleman. \"By my honor, these Gascons\nare incorrigible! Keep up the dance, then, since he will have it so.\nWhen he is tired, he will perhaps tell us that he has had enough of it.\"\n\nBut the stranger knew not the headstrong personage he had to do with;\nd'Artagnan was not the man ever to cry for quarter. The fight was\ntherefore prolonged for some seconds; but at length d'Artagnan dropped\nhis sword, which was broken in two pieces by the blow of a stick.\nAnother blow full upon his forehead at the same moment brought him to\nthe ground, covered with blood and almost fainting.\n\nIt was at this moment that people came flocking to the scene of action\nfrom all sides. The host, fearful of consequences, with the help of his\nservants carried the wounded man into the kitchen, where some trifling\nattentions were bestowed upon him.\n\nAs to the gentleman, he resumed his place at the window, and surveyed\nthe crowd with a certain impatience, evidently annoyed by their\nremaining undispersed.\n\n\"Well, how is it with this madman?\" exclaimed he, turning round as the\nnoise of the door announced the entrance of the host, who came in to\ninquire if he was unhurt.\n\n\"Your excellency is safe and sound?\" asked the host.\n\n\"Oh, yes! Perfectly safe and sound, my good host; and I wish to know\nwhat has become of our young man.\"\n\n\"He is better,\" said the host, \"he fainted quite away.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said the gentleman.\n\n\"But before he fainted, he collected all his strength to challenge you,\nand to defy you while challenging you.\"\n\n\"Why, this fellow must be the devil in person!\" cried the stranger.\n\n\"Oh, no, your Excellency, he is not the devil,\" replied the host, with\na grin of contempt; \"for during his fainting we rummaged his valise and\nfound nothing but a clean shirt and eleven crowns--which however, did\nnot prevent his saying, as he was fainting, that if such a thing had\nhappened in Paris, you should have cause to repent of it at a later\nperiod.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said the stranger coolly, \"he must be some prince in disguise.\"\n\n\"I have told you this, good sir,\" resumed the host, \"in order that you\nmay be on your guard.\"\n\n\"Did he name no one in his passion?\"\n\n\"Yes; he struck his pocket and said, 'We shall see what Monsieur de\nTreville will think of this insult offered to his protege.'\"\n\n\"Monsieur de Treville?\" said the stranger, becoming attentive, \"he\nput his hand upon his pocket while pronouncing the name of Monsieur de\nTreville? Now, my dear host, while your young man was insensible, you\ndid not fail, I am quite sure, to ascertain what that pocket contained.\nWhat was there in it?\"\n\n\"A letter addressed to Monsieur de Treville, captain of the Musketeers.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"Exactly as I have the honor to tell your Excellency.\"\n\nThe host, who was not endowed with great perspicacity, did not observe\nthe expression which his words had given to the physiognomy of the\nstranger. The latter rose from the front of the window, upon the sill\nof which he had leaned with his elbow, and knitted his brow like a man\ndisquieted.\n\n\"The devil!\" murmured he, between his teeth. \"Can Treville have set this\nGascon upon me? He is very young; but a sword thrust is a sword thrust,\nwhatever be the age of him who gives it, and a youth is less to be\nsuspected than an older man,\" and the stranger fell into a reverie\nwhich lasted some minutes. \"A weak obstacle is sometimes sufficient to\noverthrow a great design.\n\n\"Host,\" said he, \"could you not contrive to get rid of this frantic boy\nfor me? In conscience, I cannot kill him; and yet,\" added he, with a\ncoldly menacing expression, \"he annoys me. Where is he?\"\n\n\"In my wife's chamber, on the first flight, where they are dressing his\nwounds.\"\n\n\"His things and his bag are with him? Has he taken off his doublet?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, everything is in the kitchen. But if he annoys you,\nthis young fool--\"\n\n\"To be sure he does. He causes a disturbance in your hostelry, which\nrespectable people cannot put up with. Go; make out my bill and notify\nmy servant.\"\n\n\"What, monsieur, will you leave us so soon?\"\n\n\"You know that very well, as I gave my order to saddle my horse. Have\nthey not obeyed me?\"\n\n\"It is done; as your Excellency may have observed, your horse is in the\ngreat gateway, ready saddled for your departure.\"\n\n\"That is well; do as I have directed you, then.\"\n\n\"What the devil!\" said the host to himself. \"Can he be afraid of this\nboy?\" But an imperious glance from the stranger stopped him short; he\nbowed humbly and retired.\n\n\"It is not necessary for Milady* to be seen by this fellow,\" continued\nthe stranger. \"She will soon pass; she is already late. I had better get\non horseback, and go and meet her. I should like, however, to know what\nthis letter addressed to Treville contains.\"\n\n*We are well aware that this term, milady, is only properly used when\nfollowed by a family name. But we find it thus in the manuscript, and we\ndo not choose to take upon ourselves to alter it.\n\nAnd the stranger, muttering to himself, directed his steps toward the\nkitchen.\n\nIn the meantime, the host, who entertained no doubt that it was the\npresence of the young man that drove the stranger from his hostelry,\nre-ascended to his wife's chamber, and found d'Artagnan just recovering\nhis senses. Giving him to understand that the police would deal with him\npretty severely for having sought a quarrel with a great lord--for the\nopinion of the host the stranger could be nothing less than a great\nlord--he insisted that notwithstanding his weakness d'Artagnan should\nget up and depart as quickly as possible. D'Artagnan, half stupefied,\nwithout his doublet, and with his head bound up in a linen cloth,\narose then, and urged by the host, began to descend the stairs; but\non arriving at the kitchen, the first thing he saw was his antagonist\ntalking calmly at the step of a heavy carriage, drawn by two large\nNorman horses.\n\nHis interlocutor, whose head appeared through the carriage window, was\na woman of from twenty to two-and-twenty years. We have already observed\nwith what rapidity d'Artagnan seized the expression of a countenance.\nHe perceived then, at a glance, that this woman was young and beautiful;\nand her style of beauty struck him more forcibly from its being totally\ndifferent from that of the southern countries in which d'Artagnan had\nhitherto resided. She was pale and fair, with long curls falling in\nprofusion over her shoulders, had large, blue, languishing eyes, rosy\nlips, and hands of alabaster. She was talking with great animation with\nthe stranger.\n\n\"His Eminence, then, orders me--\" said the lady.\n\n\"To return instantly to England, and to inform him as soon as the duke\nleaves London.\"\n\n\"And as to my other instructions?\" asked the fair traveler.\n\n\"They are contained in this box, which you will not open until you are\non the other side of the Channel.\"\n\n\"Very well; and you--what will you do?\"\n\n\"I--I return to Paris.\"\n\n\"What, without chastising this insolent boy?\" asked the lady.\n\nThe stranger was about to reply; but at the moment he opened his mouth,\nd'Artagnan, who had heard all, precipitated himself over the threshold\nof the door.\n\n\"This insolent boy chastises others,\" cried he; \"and I hope that this\ntime he whom he ought to chastise will not escape him as before.\"\n\n\"Will not escape him?\" replied the stranger, knitting his brow.\n\n\"No; before a woman you would dare not fly, I presume?\"\n\n\"Remember,\" said Milady, seeing the stranger lay his hand on his sword,\n\"the least delay may ruin everything.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" cried the gentleman; \"begone then, on your part, and I\nwill depart as quickly on mine.\" And bowing to the lady, sprang into his\nsaddle, while her coachman applied his whip vigorously to his horses.\nThe two interlocutors thus separated, taking opposite directions, at\nfull gallop.\n\n\"Pay him, booby!\" cried the stranger to his servant, without checking\nthe speed of his horse; and the man, after throwing two or three silver\npieces at the foot of mine host, galloped after his master.\n\n\"Base coward! false gentleman!\" cried d'Artagnan, springing forward, in\nhis turn, after the servant. But his wound had rendered him too weak to\nsupport such an exertion. Scarcely had he gone ten steps when his ears\nbegan to tingle, a faintness seized him, a cloud of blood passed\nover his eyes, and he fell in the middle of the street, crying still,\n\"Coward! coward! coward!\"\n\n\"He is a coward, indeed,\" grumbled the host, drawing near to d'Artagnan,\nand endeavoring by this little flattery to make up matters with the\nyoung man, as the heron of the fable did with the snail he had despised\nthe evening before.\n\n\"Yes, a base coward,\" murmured d'Artagnan; \"but she--she was very\nbeautiful.\"\n\n\"What she?\" demanded the host.\n\n\"Milady,\" faltered d'Artagnan, and fainted a second time.\n\n\"Ah, it's all one,\" said the host; \"I have lost two customers, but this\none remains, of whom I am pretty certain for some days to come. There\nwill be eleven crowns gained.\"\n\nIt is to be remembered that eleven crowns was just the sum that remained\nin d'Artagnan's purse.\n\nThe host had reckoned upon eleven days of confinement at a crown a day,\nbut he had reckoned without his guest. On the following morning at five\no'clock d'Artagnan arose, and descending to the kitchen without help,\nasked, among other ingredients the list of which has not come down to\nus, for some oil, some wine, and some rosemary, and with his mother's\nrecipe in his hand composed a balsam, with which he anointed his\nnumerous wounds, replacing his bandages himself, and positively refusing\nthe assistance of any doctor, d'Artagnan walked about that same evening,\nand was almost cured by the morrow.\n\nBut when the time came to pay for his rosemary, this oil, and the wine,\nthe only expense the master had incurred, as he had preserved a strict\nabstinence--while on the contrary, the yellow horse, by the account of\nthe hostler at least, had eaten three times as much as a horse of his\nsize could reasonably supposed to have done--d'Artagnan found nothing\nin his pocket but his little old velvet purse with the eleven crowns\nit contained; for as to the letter addressed to M. de Treville, it had\ndisappeared.\n\nThe young man commenced his search for the letter with the greatest\npatience, turning out his pockets of all kinds over and over again,\nrummaging and rerummaging in his valise, and opening and reopening his\npurse; but when he found that he had come to the conviction that the\nletter was not to be found, he flew, for the third time, into such\na rage as was near costing him a fresh consumption of wine, oil, and\nrosemary--for upon seeing this hot-headed youth become exasperated and\nthreaten to destroy everything in the establishment if his letter were\nnot found, the host seized a spit, his wife a broom handle, and the\nservants the same sticks they had used the day before.\n\n\"My letter of recommendation!\" cried d'Artagnan, \"my letter of\nrecommendation! or, the holy blood, I will spit you all like ortolans!\"\n\nUnfortunately, there was one circumstance which created a powerful\nobstacle to the accomplishment of this threat; which was, as we have\nrelated, that his sword had been in his first conflict broken in two,\nand which he had entirely forgotten. Hence, it resulted when d'Artagnan\nproceeded to draw his sword in earnest, he found himself purely and\nsimply armed with a stump of a sword about eight or ten inches in\nlength, which the host had carefully placed in the scabbard. As to the\nrest of the blade, the master had slyly put that on one side to make\nhimself a larding pin.\n\nBut this deception would probably not have stopped our fiery young man\nif the host had not reflected that the reclamation which his guest made\nwas perfectly just.\n\n\"But, after all,\" said he, lowering the point of his spit, \"where is\nthis letter?\"\n\n\"Yes, where is this letter?\" cried d'Artagnan. \"In the first place, I\nwarn you that that letter is for Monsieur de Treville, and it must be\nfound, he will know how to find it.\"\n\nHis threat completed the intimidation of the host. After the king and\nthe cardinal, M. de Treville was the man whose name was perhaps most\nfrequently repeated by the military, and even by citizens. There was,\nto be sure, Father Joseph, but his name was never pronounced but with a\nsubdued voice, such was the terror inspired by his Gray Eminence, as the\ncardinal's familiar was called.\n\nThrowing down his spit, and ordering his wife to do the same with her\nbroom handle, and the servants with their sticks, he set the first\nexample of commencing an earnest search for the lost letter.\n\n\"Does the letter contain anything valuable?\" demanded the host, after a\nfew minutes of useless investigation.\n\n\"Zounds! I think it does indeed!\" cried the Gascon, who reckoned upon\nthis letter for making his way at court. \"It contained my fortune!\"\n\n\"Bills upon Spain?\" asked the disturbed host.\n\n\"Bills upon his Majesty's private treasury,\" answered d'Artagnan, who,\nreckoning upon entering into the king's service in consequence of this\nrecommendation, believed he could make this somewhat hazardous reply\nwithout telling of a falsehood.\n\n\"The devil!\" cried the host, at his wit's end.\n\n\"But it's of no importance,\" continued d'Artagnan, with natural\nassurance; \"it's of no importance. The money is nothing; that letter was\neverything. I would rather have lost a thousand pistoles than have lost\nit.\" He would not have risked more if he had said twenty thousand; but a\ncertain juvenile modesty restrained him.\n\nA ray of light all at once broke upon the mind of the host as he was\ngiving himself to the devil upon finding nothing.\n\n\"That letter is not lost!\" cried he.\n\n\"What!\" cried d'Artagnan.\n\n\"No, it has been stolen from you.\"\n\n\"Stolen? By whom?\"\n\n\"By the gentleman who was here yesterday. He came down into the kitchen,\nwhere your doublet was. He remained there some time alone. I would lay a\nwager he has stolen it.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" answered d'Artagnan, but little convinced, as he knew\nbetter than anyone else how entirely personal the value of this letter\nwas, and was nothing in it likely to tempt cupidity. The fact was that\nnone of his servants, none of the travelers present, could have gained\nanything by being possessed of this paper.\n\n\"Do you say,\" resumed d'Artagnan, \"that you suspect that impertinent\ngentleman?\"\n\n\"I tell you I am sure of it,\" continued the host. \"When I informed him\nthat your lordship was the protege of Monsieur de Treville, and that you\neven had a letter for that illustrious gentleman, he appeared to be very\nmuch disturbed, and asked me where that letter was, and immediately came\ndown into the kitchen, where he knew your doublet was.\"\n\n\"Then that's my thief,\" replied d'Artagnan. \"I will complain to Monsieur\nde Treville, and Monsieur de Treville will complain to the king.\" He\nthen drew two crowns majestically from his purse and gave them to the\nhost, who accompanied him, cap in hand, to the gate, and remounted his\nyellow horse, which bore him without any further accident to the gate of\nSt. Antoine at Paris, where his owner sold him for three crowns, which\nwas a very good price, considering that d'Artagnan had ridden him hard\nduring the last stage. Thus the dealer to whom d'Artagnan sold him for\nthe nine livres did not conceal from the young man that he only gave\nthat enormous sum for him on the account of the originality of his\ncolor.\n\nThus d'Artagnan entered Paris on foot, carrying his little packet under\nhis arm, and walked about till he found an apartment to be let on\nterms suited to the scantiness of his means. This chamber was a sort of\ngarret, situated in the Rue des Fossoyeurs, near the Luxembourg.\n\nAs soon as the earnest money was paid, d'Artagnan took possession of his\nlodging, and passed the remainder of the day in sewing onto his doublet\nand hose some ornamental braiding which his mother had taken off an\nalmost-new doublet of the elder M. d'Artagnan, and which she had given\nher son secretly. Next he went to the Quai de Feraille to have a new\nblade put to his sword, and then returned toward the Louvre, inquiring\nof the first Musketeer he met for the situation of the hotel of M. de\nTreville, which proved to be in the Rue du Vieux-Colombier; that is to\nsay, in the immediate vicinity of the chamber hired by d'Artagnan--a\ncircumstance which appeared to furnish a happy augury for the success of\nhis journey.\n\nAfter this, satisfied with the way in which he had conducted himself at\nMeung, without remorse for the past, confident in the present, and full\nof hope for the future, he retired to bed and slept the sleep of the\nbrave.\n\nThis sleep, provincial as it was, brought him to nine o'clock in the\nmorning; at which hour he rose, in order to repair to the residence\nof M. de Treville, the third personage in the kingdom, in the paternal\nestimation.\n\n\n\n\n2 THE ANTECHAMBER OF M. DE TREVILLE\n\nM. de Troisville, as his family was still called in Gascony, or M.\nde Treville, as he has ended by styling himself in Paris, had really\ncommenced life as d'Artagnan now did; that is to say, without a sou in\nhis pocket, but with a fund of audacity, shrewdness, and intelligence\nwhich makes the poorest Gascon gentleman often derive more in his hope\nfrom the paternal inheritance than the richest Perigordian or Berrichan\ngentleman derives in reality from his. His insolent bravery, his still\nmore insolent success at a time when blows poured down like hail, had\nborne him to the top of that difficult ladder called Court Favor, which\nhe had climbed four steps at a time.\n\nHe was the friend of the king, who honored highly, as everyone knows,\nthe memory of his father, Henry IV. The father of M. de Treville had\nserved him so faithfully in his wars against the league that in default\nof money--a thing to which the Bearnais was accustomed all his life, and\nwho constantly paid his debts with that of which he never stood in need\nof borrowing, that is to say, with ready wit--in default of money, we\nrepeat, he authorized him, after the reduction of Paris, to assume for\nhis arms a golden lion passant upon gules, with the motto FIDELIS ET\nFORTIS. This was a great matter in the way of honor, but very little in\nthe way of wealth; so that when the illustrious companion of the great\nHenry died, the only inheritance he was able to leave his son was his\nsword and his motto. Thanks to this double gift and the spotless name\nthat accompanied it, M. de Treville was admitted into the household of\nthe young prince where he made such good use of his sword, and was so\nfaithful to his motto, that Louis XIII, one of the good blades of his\nkingdom, was accustomed to say that if he had a friend who was about\nto fight, he would advise him to choose as a second, himself first, and\nTreville next--or even, perhaps, before himself.\n\nThus Louis XIII had a real liking for Treville--a royal liking, a\nself-interested liking, it is true, but still a liking. At that unhappy\nperiod it was an important consideration to be surrounded by such men\nas Treville. Many might take for their device the epithet STRONG, which\nformed the second part of his motto, but very few gentlemen could lay\nclaim to the FAITHFUL, which constituted the first. Treville was one of\nthese latter. His was one of those rare organizations, endowed with an\nobedient intelligence like that of the dog; with a blind valor, a quick\neye, and a prompt hand; to whom sight appeared only to be given to see\nif the king were dissatisfied with anyone, and the hand to strike this\ndispleasing personage, whether a Besme, a Maurevers, a Poltiot de Mere,\nor a Vitry. In short, up to this period nothing had been wanting to\nTreville but opportunity; but he was ever on the watch for it, and he\nfaithfully promised himself that he would not fail to seize it by its\nthree hairs whenever it came within reach of his hand. At last Louis\nXIII made Treville the captain of his Musketeers, who were to Louis XIII\nin devotedness, or rather in fanaticism, what his Ordinaries had been to\nHenry III, and his Scotch Guard to Louis XI.\n\nOn his part, the cardinal was not behind the king in this respect.\nWhen he saw the formidable and chosen body with which Louis XIII had\nsurrounded himself, this second, or rather this first king of France,\nbecame desirous that he, too, should have his guard. He had his\nMusketeers therefore, as Louis XIII had his, and these two powerful\nrivals vied with each other in procuring, not only from all the\nprovinces of France, but even from all foreign states, the most\ncelebrated swordsmen. It was not uncommon for Richelieu and Louis XIII\nto dispute over their evening game of chess upon the merits of their\nservants. Each boasted the bearing and the courage of his own people.\nWhile exclaiming loudly against duels and brawls, they excited them\nsecretly to quarrel, deriving an immoderate satisfaction or genuine\nregret from the success or defeat of their own combatants. We learn this\nfrom the memoirs of a man who was concerned in some few of these defeats\nand in many of these victories.\n\nTreville had grasped the weak side of his master; and it was to this\naddress that he owed the long and constant favor of a king who has\nnot left the reputation behind him of being very faithful in his\nfriendships. He paraded his Musketeers before the Cardinal Armand\nDuplessis with an insolent air which made the gray moustache of his\nEminence curl with ire. Treville understood admirably the war method of\nthat period, in which he who could not live at the expense of the enemy\nmust live at the expense of his compatriots. His soldiers formed a\nlegion of devil-may-care fellows, perfectly undisciplined toward all but\nhimself.\n\nLoose, half-drunk, imposing, the king's Musketeers, or rather M. de\nTreville's, spread themselves about in the cabarets, in the public\nwalks, and the public sports, shouting, twisting their mustaches,\nclanking their swords, and taking great pleasure in annoying the Guards\nof the cardinal whenever they could fall in with them; then drawing\nin the open streets, as if it were the best of all possible sports;\nsometimes killed, but sure in that case to be both wept and avenged;\noften killing others, but then certain of not rotting in prison, M. de\nTreville being there to claim them. Thus M. de Treville was praised to\nthe highest note by these men, who adored him, and who, ruffians as they\nwere, trembled before him like scholars before their master, obedient\nto his least word, and ready to sacrifice themselves to wash out the\nsmallest insult.\n\nM. de Treville employed this powerful weapon for the king, in the first\nplace, and the friends of the king--and then for himself and his own\nfriends. For the rest, in the memoirs of this period, which has left so\nmany memoirs, one does not find this worthy gentleman blamed even by his\nenemies; and he had many such among men of the pen as well as among\nmen of the sword. In no instance, let us say, was this worthy gentleman\naccused of deriving personal advantage from the cooperation of his\nminions. Endowed with a rare genius for intrigue which rendered him\nthe equal of the ablest intriguers, he remained an honest man. Still\nfurther, in spite of sword thrusts which weaken, and painful exercises\nwhich fatigue, he had become one of the most gallant frequenters of\nrevels, one of the most insinuating lady's men, one of the softest\nwhisperers of interesting nothings of his day; the BONNES FORTUNES of de\nTreville were talked of as those of M. de Bassompierre had been talked\nof twenty years before, and that was not saying a little. The captain\nof the Musketeers was therefore admired, feared, and loved; and this\nconstitutes the zenith of human fortune.\n\nLouis XIV absorbed all the smaller stars of his court in his own vast\nradiance; but his father, a sun PLURIBUS IMPAR, left his personal\nsplendor to each of his favorites, his individual value to each of his\ncourtiers. In addition to the leeves of the king and the cardinal, there\nmight be reckoned in Paris at that time more than two hundred smaller\nbut still noteworthy leeves. Among these two hundred leeves, that of\nTreville was one of the most sought.\n\nThe court of his hotel, situated in the Rue du Vieux-Colombier,\nresembled a camp from by six o'clock in the morning in summer and eight\no'clock in winter. From fifty to sixty Musketeers, who appeared to\nreplace one another in order always to present an imposing number,\nparaded constantly, armed to the teeth and ready for anything. On one\nof those immense staircases, upon whose space modern civilization would\nbuild a whole house, ascended and descended the office seekers of Paris,\nwho ran after any sort of favor--gentlemen from the provinces anxious\nto be enrolled, and servants in all sorts of liveries, bringing and\ncarrying messages between their masters and M. de Treville. In the\nantechamber, upon long circular benches, reposed the elect; that is\nto say, those who were called. In this apartment a continued buzzing\nprevailed from morning till night, while M. de Treville, in his office\ncontiguous to this antechamber, received visits, listened to complaints,\ngave his orders, and like the king in his balcony at the Louvre, had\nonly to place himself at the window to review both his men and arms.\n\nThe day on which d'Artagnan presented himself the assemblage was\nimposing, particularly for a provincial just arriving from his province.\nIt is true that this provincial was a Gascon; and that, particularly\nat this period, the compatriots of d'Artagnan had the reputation of\nnot being easily intimidated. When he had once passed the massive door\ncovered with long square-headed nails, he fell into the midst of a troop\nof swordsmen, who crossed one another in their passage, calling out,\nquarreling, and playing tricks one with another. In order to make one's\nway amid these turbulent and conflicting waves, it was necessary to be\nan officer, a great noble, or a pretty woman.\n\nIt was, then, into the midst of this tumult and disorder that our young\nman advanced with a beating heat, ranging his long rapier up his lanky\nleg, and keeping one hand on the edge of his cap, with that half-smile\nof the embarrassed a provincial who wishes to put on a good face. When\nhe had passed one group he began to breathe more freely; but he could\nnot help observing that they turned round to look at him, and for the\nfirst time in his life d'Artagnan, who had till that day entertained a\nvery good opinion of himself, felt ridiculous.\n\nArrived at the staircase, it was still worse. There were four Musketeers\non the bottom steps, amusing themselves with the following exercise,\nwhile ten or twelve of their comrades waited upon the landing place to\ntake their turn in the sport.\n\nOne of them, stationed upon the top stair, naked sword in hand,\nprevented, or at least endeavored to prevent, the three others from\nascending.\n\nThese three others fenced against him with their agile swords.\n\nD'Artagnan at first took these weapons for foils, and believed them\nto be buttoned; but he soon perceived by certain scratches that every\nweapon was pointed and sharpened, and that at each of these scratches\nnot only the spectators, but even the actors themselves, laughed like so\nmany madmen.\n\nHe who at the moment occupied the upper step kept his adversaries\nmarvelously in check. A circle was formed around them. The conditions\nrequired that at every hit the man touched should quit the game,\nyielding his turn for the benefit of the adversary who had hit him. In\nfive minutes three were slightly wounded, one on the hand, another on\nthe ear, by the defender of the stair, who himself remained intact--a\npiece of skill which was worth to him, according to the rules agreed\nupon, three turns of favor.\n\nHowever difficult it might be, or rather as he pretended it was, to\nastonish our young traveler, this pastime really astonished him. He\nhad seen in his province--that land in which heads become so easily\nheated--a few of the preliminaries of duels; but the daring of these\nfour fencers appeared to him the strongest he had ever heard of even\nin Gascony. He believed himself transported into that famous country of\ngiants into which Gulliver afterward went and was so frightened; and yet\nhe had not gained the goal, for there were still the landing place and\nthe antechamber.\n\nOn the landing they were no longer fighting, but amused themselves with\nstories about women, and in the antechamber, with stories about\nthe court. On the landing d'Artagnan blushed; in the antechamber he\ntrembled. His warm and fickle imagination, which in Gascony had rendered\nformidable to young chambermaids, and even sometimes their mistresses,\nhad never dreamed, even in moments of delirium, of half the amorous\nwonders or a quarter of the feats of gallantry which were here set\nforth in connection with names the best known and with details the least\nconcealed. But if his morals were shocked on the landing, his respect\nfor the cardinal was scandalized in the antechamber. There, to his great\nastonishment, d'Artagnan heard the policy which made all Europe\ntremble criticized aloud and openly, as well as the private life of the\ncardinal, which so many great nobles had been punished for trying to pry\ninto. That great man who was so revered by d'Artagnan the elder served\nas an object of ridicule to the Musketeers of Treville, who cracked\ntheir jokes upon his bandy legs and his crooked back. Some sang ballads\nabout Mme. d'Aguillon, his mistress, and Mme. Cambalet, his niece; while\nothers formed parties and plans to annoy the pages and guards of\nthe cardinal duke--all things which appeared to d'Artagnan monstrous\nimpossibilities.\n\nNevertheless, when the name of the king was now and then uttered\nunthinkingly amid all these cardinal jests, a sort of gag seemed to\nclose for a moment on all these jeering mouths. They looked hesitatingly\naround them, and appeared to doubt the thickness of the partition\nbetween them and the office of M. de Treville; but a fresh allusion soon\nbrought back the conversation to his Eminence, and then the laughter\nrecovered its loudness and the light was not withheld from any of his\nactions.\n\n\"Certes, these fellows will all either be imprisoned or hanged,\" thought\nthe terrified d'Artagnan, \"and I, no doubt, with them; for from the\nmoment I have either listened to or heard them, I shall be held as an\naccomplice. What would my good father say, who so strongly pointed out\nto me the respect due to the cardinal, if he knew I was in the society\nof such pagans?\"\n\nWe have no need, therefore, to say that d'Artagnan dared not join in the\nconversation, only he looked with all his eyes and listened with all his\nears, stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing; and despite his\nconfidence on the paternal admonitions, he felt himself carried by\nhis tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to blame the\nunheard-of things which were taking place.\n\nAlthough he was a perfect stranger in the court of M. de Treville's\ncourtiers, and this his first appearance in that place, he was at length\nnoticed, and somebody came and asked him what he wanted. At this\ndemand d'Artagnan gave his name very modestly, emphasized the title of\ncompatriot, and begged the servant who had put the question to him\nto request a moment's audience of M. de Treville--a request which the\nother, with an air of protection, promised to transmit in due season.\n\nD'Artagnan, a little recovered from his first surprise, had now leisure\nto study costumes and physiognomy.\n\nThe center of the most animated group was a Musketeer of great height\nand haughty countenance, dressed in a costume so peculiar as to attract\ngeneral attention. He did not wear the uniform cloak--which was not\nobligatory at that epoch of less liberty but more independence--but\na cerulean-blue doublet, a little faded and worn, and over this a\nmagnificent baldric, worked in gold, which shone like water ripples in\nthe sun. A long cloak of crimson velvet fell in graceful folds from\nhis shoulders, disclosing in front the splendid baldric, from which was\nsuspended a gigantic rapier. This Musketeer had just come off guard,\ncomplained of having a cold, and coughed from time to time affectedly.\nIt was for this reason, as he said to those around him, that he had\nput on his cloak; and while he spoke with a lofty air and twisted\nhis mustache disdainfully, all admired his embroidered baldric, and\nd'Artagnan more than anyone.\n\n\n\"What would you have?\" said the Musketeer. \"This fashion is coming in.\nIt is a folly, I admit, but still it is the fashion. Besides, one must\nlay out one's inheritance somehow.\"\n\n\"Ah, Porthos!\" cried one of his companions, \"don't try to make us\nbelieve you obtained that baldric by paternal generosity. It was given\nto you by that veiled lady I met you with the other Sunday, near the\ngate St. Honor.\"\n\n\"No, upon honor and by the faith of a gentleman, I bought it with the\ncontents of my own purse,\" answered he whom they designated by the name\nPorthos.\n\n\"Yes; about in the same manner,\" said another Musketeer, \"that I bought\nthis new purse with what my mistress put into the old one.\"\n\n\"It's true, though,\" said Porthos; \"and the proof is that I paid twelve\npistoles for it.\"\n\nThe wonder was increased, though the doubt continued to exist.\n\n\"Is it not true, Aramis?\" said Porthos, turning toward another\nMusketeer.\n\nThis other Musketeer formed a perfect contrast to his interrogator, who\nhad just designated him by the name of Aramis. He was a stout man, of\nabout two- or three-and-twenty, with an open, ingenuous countenance,\na black, mild eye, and cheeks rosy and downy as an autumn peach. His\ndelicate mustache marked a perfectly straight line upon his upper lip;\nhe appeared to dread to lower his hands lest their veins should swell,\nand he pinched the tips of his ears from time to time to preserve their\ndelicate pink transparency. Habitually he spoke little and slowly, bowed\nfrequently, laughed without noise, showing his teeth, which were fine\nand of which, as the rest of his person, he appeared to take great care.\nHe answered the appeal of his friend by an affirmative nod of the head.\n\nThis affirmation appeared to dispel all doubts with regard to the\nbaldric. They continued to admire it, but said no more about it; and\nwith a rapid change of thought, the conversation passed suddenly to\nanother subject.\n\n\"What do you think of the story Chalais's esquire relates?\" asked\nanother Musketeer, without addressing anyone in particular, but on the\ncontrary speaking to everybody.\n\n\"And what does he say?\" asked Porthos, in a self-sufficient tone.\n\n\"He relates that he met at Brussels Rochefort, the AME DAMNEE of the\ncardinal disguised as a Capuchin, and that this cursed Rochefort, thanks\nto his disguise, had tricked Monsieur de Laigues, like a ninny as he\nis.\"\n\n\"A ninny, indeed!\" said Porthos; \"but is the matter certain?\"\n\n\"I had it from Aramis,\" replied the Musketeer.\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"Why, you knew it, Porthos,\" said Aramis. \"I told you of it yesterday.\nLet us say no more about it.\"\n\n\"Say no more about it? That's YOUR opinion!\" replied Porthos.\n\n\"Say no more about it! PESTE! You come to your conclusions quickly.\nWhat! The cardinal sets a spy upon a gentleman, has his letters stolen\nfrom him by means of a traitor, a brigand, a rascal-has, with the help\nof this spy and thanks to this correspondence, Chalais's throat cut,\nunder the stupid pretext that he wanted to kill the king and marry\nMonsieur to the queen! Nobody knew a word of this enigma. You unraveled\nit yesterday to the great satisfaction of all; and while we are still\ngaping with wonder at the news, you come and tell us today, 'Let us say\nno more about it.'\"\n\n\"Well, then, let us talk about it, since you desire it,\" replied Aramis,\npatiently.\n\n\"This Rochefort,\" cried Porthos, \"if I were the esquire of poor Chalais,\nshould pass a minute or two very uncomfortably with me.\"\n\n\"And you--you would pass rather a sad quarter-hour with the Red Duke,\"\nreplied Aramis.\n\n\"Oh, the Red Duke! Bravo! Bravo! The Red Duke!\" cried Porthos, clapping\nhis hands and nodding his head. \"The Red Duke is capital. I'll circulate\nthat saying, be assured, my dear fellow. Who says this Aramis is not\na wit? What a misfortune it is you did not follow your first vocation;\nwhat a delicious abbe you would have made!\"\n\n\"Oh, it's only a temporary postponement,\" replied Aramis; \"I shall\nbe one someday. You very well know, Porthos, that I continue to study\ntheology for that purpose.\"\n\n\"He will be one, as he says,\" cried Porthos; \"he will be one, sooner or\nlater.\"\n\n\"Sooner.\" said Aramis.\n\n\"He only waits for one thing to determine him to resume his cassock,\nwhich hangs behind his uniform,\" said another Musketeer.\n\n\"What is he waiting for?\" asked another.\n\n\"Only till the queen has given an heir to the crown of France.\"\n\n\"No jesting upon that subject, gentlemen,\" said Porthos; \"thank God the\nqueen is still of an age to give one!\"\n\n\"They say that Monsieur de Buckingham is in France,\" replied Aramis,\nwith a significant smile which gave to this sentence, apparently so\nsimple, a tolerably scandalous meaning.\n\n\"Aramis, my good friend, this time you are wrong,\" interrupted Porthos.\n\"Your wit is always leading you beyond bounds; if Monsieur de Treville\nheard you, you would repent of speaking thus.\"\n\n\"Are you going to give me a lesson, Porthos?\" cried Aramis, from whose\nusually mild eye a flash passed like lightning.\n\n\"My dear fellow, be a Musketeer or an abbe. Be one or the other, but not\nboth,\" replied Porthos. \"You know what Athos told you the other day; you\neat at everybody's mess. Ah, don't be angry, I beg of you, that would be\nuseless; you know what is agreed upon between you, Athos and me. You go\nto Madame d'Aguillon's, and you pay your court to her; you go to Madame\nde Bois-Tracy's, the cousin of Madame de Chevreuse, and you pass for\nbeing far advanced in the good graces of that lady. Oh, good Lord!\nDon't trouble yourself to reveal your good luck; no one asks for your\nsecret-all the world knows your discretion. But since you possess that\nvirtue, why the devil don't you make use of it with respect to her\nMajesty? Let whoever likes talk of the king and the cardinal, and how he\nlikes; but the queen is sacred, and if anyone speaks of her, let it be\nrespectfully.\"\n\n\"Porthos, you are as vain as Narcissus; I plainly tell you so,\" replied\nAramis. \"You know I hate moralizing, except when it is done by Athos.\nAs to you, good sir, you wear too magnificent a baldric to be strong\non that head. I will be an abbe if it suits me. In the meanwhile I am\na Musketeer; in that quality I say what I please, and at this moment it\npleases me to say that you weary me.\"\n\n\"Aramis!\"\n\n\"Porthos!\"\n\n\"Gentlemen! Gentlemen!\" cried the surrounding group.\n\n\"Monsieur de Treville awaits Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" cried a servant,\nthrowing open the door of the cabinet.\n\nAt this announcement, during which the door remained open, everyone\nbecame mute, and amid the general silence the young man crossed part of\nthe length of the antechamber, and entered the apartment of the captain\nof the Musketeers, congratulating himself with all his heart at having\nso narrowly escaped the end of this strange quarrel.\n\n\n\n\n3 THE AUDIENCE\n\nM. de Treville was at the moment in rather ill-humor, nevertheless he\nsaluted the young man politely, who bowed to the very ground; and he\nsmiled on receiving d'Artagnan's response, the Bearnese accent of which\nrecalled to him at the same time his youth and his country--a double\nremembrance which makes a man smile at all ages; but stepping toward the\nantechamber and making a sign to d'Artagnan with his hand, as if to ask\nhis permission to finish with others before he began with him, he called\nthree times, with a louder voice at each time, so that he ran through\nthe intervening tones between the imperative accent and the angry\naccent.\n\n\"Athos! Porthos! Aramis!\"\n\nThe two Musketeers with whom we have already made acquaintance, and who\nanswered to the last of these three names, immediately quitted the group\nof which they had formed a part, and advanced toward the cabinet, the\ndoor of which closed after them as soon as they had entered. Their\nappearance, although it was not quite at ease, excited by its\ncarelessness, at once full of dignity and submission, the admiration of\nd'Artagnan, who beheld in these two men demigods, and in their leader an\nOlympian Jupiter, armed with all his thunders.\n\nWhen the two Musketeers had entered; when the door was closed behind\nthem; when the buzzing murmur of the antechamber, to which the summons\nwhich had been made had doubtless furnished fresh food, had recommenced;\nwhen M. de Treville had three or four times paced in silence, and with a\nfrowning brow, the whole length of his cabinet, passing each time before\nPorthos and Aramis, who were as upright and silent as if on parade--he\nstopped all at once full in front of them, and covering them from head\nto foot with an angry look, \"Do you know what the king said to me,\"\ncried he, \"and that no longer ago than yesterday evening--do you know,\ngentlemen?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the two Musketeers, after a moment's silence, \"no, sir, we\ndo not.\"\n\n\"But I hope that you will do us the honor to tell us,\" added Aramis, in\nhis politest tone and with his most graceful bow.\n\n\"He told me that he should henceforth recruit his Musketeers from among\nthe Guards of Monsieur the Cardinal.\"\n\n\"The Guards of the cardinal! And why so?\" asked Porthos, warmly.\n\n\"Because he plainly perceives that his piquette* stands in need of being\nenlivened by a mixture of good wine.\"\n\n*A watered liquor, made from the second pressing of the grape.\n\nThe two Musketeers reddened to the whites of their eyes. d'Artagnan did\nnot know where he was, and wished himself a hundred feet underground.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" continued M. de Treville, growing warmer as he spoke,\n\"and his majesty was right; for, upon my honor, it is true that the\nMusketeers make but a miserable figure at court. The cardinal related\nyesterday while playing with the king, with an air of condolence\nvery displeasing to me, that the day before yesterday those DAMNED\nMUSKETEERS, those DAREDEVILS--he dwelt upon those words with an ironical\ntone still more displeasing to me--those BRAGGARTS, added he, glancing\nat me with his tiger-cat's eye, had made a riot in the Rue Ferou in a\ncabaret, and that a party of his Guards (I thought he was going to laugh\nin my face) had been forced to arrest the rioters! MORBLEU! You must\nknow something about it. Arrest Musketeers! You were among them--you\nwere! Don't deny it; you were recognized, and the cardinal named you.\nBut it's all my fault; yes, it's all my fault, because it is myself who\nselects my men. You, Aramis, why the devil did you ask me for a uniform\nwhen you would have been so much better in a cassock? And you, Porthos,\ndo you only wear such a fine golden baldric to suspend a sword of straw\nfrom it? And Athos--I don't see Athos. Where is he?\"\n\n\"Ill--\"\n\n\"Very ill, say you? And of what malady?\"\n\n\"It is feared that it may be the smallpox, sir,\" replied Porthos,\ndesirous of taking his turn in the conversation; \"and what is serious is\nthat it will certainly spoil his face.\"\n\n\"The smallpox! That's a great story to tell me, Porthos! Sick of the\nsmallpox at his age! No, no; but wounded without doubt, killed, perhaps.\nAh, if I knew! S'blood! Messieurs Musketeers, I will not have this\nhaunting of bad places, this quarreling in the streets, this swordplay\nat the crossways; and above all, I will not have occasion given for\nthe cardinal's Guards, who are brave, quiet, skillful men who never put\nthemselves in a position to be arrested, and who, besides, never allow\nthemselves to be arrested, to laugh at you! I am sure of it--they would\nprefer dying on the spot to being arrested or taking back a step. To\nsave yourselves, to scamper away, to flee--that is good for the king's\nMusketeers!\"\n\nPorthos and Aramis trembled with rage. They could willingly have\nstrangled M. de Treville, if, at the bottom of all this, they had not\nfelt it was the great love he bore them which made him speak thus. They\nstamped upon the carpet with their feet; they bit their lips till the\nblood came, and grasped the hilts of their swords with all their might.\nAll without had heard, as we have said, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis\ncalled, and had guessed, from M. de Treville's tone of voice, that he\nwas very angry about something. Ten curious heads were glued to the\ntapestry and became pale with fury; for their ears, closely applied to\nthe door, did not lose a syllable of what he said, while their mouths\nrepeated as he went on, the insulting expressions of the captain to\nall the people in the antechamber. In an instant, from the door of the\ncabinet to the street gate, the whole hotel was boiling.\n\n\"Ah! The king's Musketeers are arrested by the Guards of the cardinal,\nare they?\" continued M. de Treville, as furious at heart as his\nsoldiers, but emphasizing his words and plunging them, one by one, so to\nsay, like so many blows of a stiletto, into the bosoms of his auditors.\n\"What! Six of his Eminence's Guards arrest six of his Majesty's\nMusketeers! MORBLEU! My part is taken! I will go straight to the louvre;\nI will give in my resignation as captain of the king's Musketeers to\ntake a lieutenancy in the cardinal's Guards, and if he refuses me,\nMORBLEU! I will turn abbe.\"\n\nAt these words, the murmur without became an explosion; nothing was to\nbe heard but oaths and blasphemies. The MORBLEUS, the SANG DIEUS, the\nMORTS TOUTS LES DIABLES, crossed one another in the air. D'Artagnan\nlooked for some tapestry behind which he might hide himself, and felt an\nimmense inclination to crawl under the table.\n\n\"Well, my Captain,\" said Porthos, quite beside himself, \"the truth is\nthat we were six against six. But we were not captured by fair means;\nand before we had time to draw our swords, two of our party were dead,\nand Athos, grievously wounded, was very little better. For you know\nAthos. Well, Captain, he endeavored twice to get up, and fell again\ntwice. And we did not surrender--no! They dragged us away by force. On\nthe way we escaped. As for Athos, they believed him to be dead, and left\nhim very quiet on the field of battle, not thinking it worth the trouble\nto carry him away. That's the whole story. What the devil, Captain, one\ncannot win all one's battles! The great Pompey lost that of Pharsalia;\nand Francis the First, who was, as I have heard say, as good as other\nfolks, nevertheless lost the Battle of Pavia.\"\n\n\"And I have the honor of assuring you that I killed one of them with his\nown sword,\" said Aramis; \"for mine was broken at the first parry. Killed\nhim, or poniarded him, sir, as is most agreeable to you.\"\n\n\"I did not know that,\" replied M. de Treville, in a somewhat softened\ntone. \"The cardinal exaggerated, as I perceive.\"\n\n\"But pray, sir,\" continued Aramis, who, seeing his captain become\nappeased, ventured to risk a prayer, \"do not say that Athos is wounded.\nHe would be in despair if that should come to the ears of the king; and\nas the wound is very serious, seeing that after crossing the shoulder it\npenetrates into the chest, it is to be feared--\"\n\nAt this instant the tapestry was raised and a noble and handsome head,\nbut frightfully pale, appeared under the fringe.\n\n\"Athos!\" cried the two Musketeers.\n\n\"Athos!\" repeated M. de Treville himself.\n\n\"You have sent for me, sir,\" said Athos to M. de Treville, in a feeble\nyet perfectly calm voice, \"you have sent for me, as my comrades inform\nme, and I have hastened to receive your orders. I am here; what do you\nwant with me?\"\n\nAnd at these words, the Musketeer, in irreproachable costume, belted as\nusual, with a tolerably firm step, entered the cabinet. M. de Treville,\nmoved to the bottom of his heart by this proof of courage, sprang toward\nhim.\n\n\"I was about to say to these gentlemen,\" added he, \"that I forbid my\nMusketeers to expose their lives needlessly; for brave men are very dear\nto the king, and the king knows that his Musketeers are the bravest on\nthe earth. Your hand, Athos!\"\n\nAnd without waiting for the answer of the newcomer to this proof of\naffection, M. de Treville seized his right hand and pressed it with\nall his might, without perceiving that Athos, whatever might be his\nself-command, allowed a slight murmur of pain to escape him, and if\npossible, grew paler than he was before.\n\nThe door had remained open, so strong was the excitement produced by\nthe arrival of Athos, whose wound, though kept as a secret, was known to\nall. A burst of satisfaction hailed the last words of the captain;\nand two or three heads, carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment,\nappeared through the openings of the tapestry. M. de Treville was about\nto reprehend this breach of the rules of etiquette, when he felt the\nhand of Athos, who had rallied all his energies to contend against pain,\nat length overcome by it, fell upon the floor as if he were dead.\n\n\"A surgeon!\" cried M. de Treville, \"mine! The king's! The best! A\nsurgeon! Or, s'blood, my brave Athos will die!\"\n\nAt the cries of M. de Treville, the whole assemblage rushed into the\ncabinet, he not thinking to shut the door against anyone, and all\ncrowded round the wounded man. But all this eager attention might have\nbeen useless if the doctor so loudly called for had not chanced to be\nin the hotel. He pushed through the crowd, approached Athos, still\ninsensible, and as all this noise and commotion inconvenienced him\ngreatly, he required, as the first and most urgent thing, that the\nMusketeer should be carried into an adjoining chamber. Immediately M.\nde Treville opened and pointed the way to Porthos and Aramis, who bore\ntheir comrade in their arms. Behind this group walked the surgeon; and\nbehind the surgeon the door closed.\n\nThe cabinet of M. de Treville, generally held so sacred, became in an\ninstant the annex of the antechamber. Everyone spoke, harangued, and\nvociferated, swearing, cursing, and consigning the cardinal and his\nGuards to all the devils.\n\nAn instant after, Porthos and Aramis re-entered, the surgeon and M. de\nTreville alone remaining with the wounded.\n\nAt length, M. de Treville himself returned. The injured man had\nrecovered his senses. The surgeon declared that the situation of the\nMusketeer had nothing in it to render his friends uneasy, his weakness\nhaving been purely and simply caused by loss of blood.\n\nThen M. de Treville made a sign with his hand, and all retired except\nd'Artagnan, who did not forget that he had an audience, and with the\ntenacity of a Gascon remained in his place.\n\nWhen all had gone out and the door was closed, M. de Treville, on\nturning round, found himself alone with the young man. The event which\nhad occurred had in some degree broken the thread of his ideas. He\ninquired what was the will of his persevering visitor. d'Artagnan then\nrepeated his name, and in an instant recovering all his remembrances of\nthe present and the past, M. de Treville grasped the situation.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" said he, smiling, \"pardon me my dear compatriot, but I\nhad wholly forgotten you. But what help is there for it! A captain\nis nothing but a father of a family, charged with even a greater\nresponsibility than the father of an ordinary family. Soldiers are\nbig children; but as I maintain that the orders of the king, and more\nparticularly the orders of the cardinal, should be executed--\"\n\nD'Artagnan could not restrain a smile. By this smile M. de Treville\njudged that he had not to deal with a fool, and changing the\nconversation, came straight to the point.\n\n\"I respected your father very much,\" said he. \"What can I do for the\nson? Tell me quickly; my time is not my own.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said d'Artagnan, \"on quitting Tarbes and coming hither, it\nwas my intention to request of you, in remembrance of the friendship\nwhich you have not forgotten, the uniform of a Musketeer; but after all\nthat I have seen during the last two hours, I comprehend that such a\nfavor is enormous, and tremble lest I should not merit it.\"\n\n\"It is indeed a favor, young man,\" replied M. de Treville, \"but it may\nnot be so far beyond your hopes as you believe, or rather as you appear\nto believe. But his majesty's decision is always necessary; and I inform\nyou with regret that no one becomes a Musketeer without the preliminary\nordeal of several campaigns, certain brilliant actions, or a service of\ntwo years in some other regiment less favored than ours.\"\n\nD'Artagnan bowed without replying, feeling his desire to don the\nMusketeer's uniform vastly increased by the great difficulties which\npreceded the attainment of it.\n\n\"But,\" continued M. de Treville, fixing upon his compatriot a look so\npiercing that it might be said he wished to read the thoughts of his\nheart, \"on account of my old companion, your father, as I have said, I\nwill do something for you, young man. Our recruits from Bearn are not\ngenerally very rich, and I have no reason to think matters have much\nchanged in this respect since I left the province. I dare say you have\nnot brought too large a stock of money with you?\"\n\nD'Artagnan drew himself up with a proud air which plainly said, \"I ask\nalms of no man.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's very well, young man,\" continued M. de Treville, \"that's all\nvery well. I know these airs; I myself came to Paris with four crowns in\nmy purse, and would have fought with anyone who dared to tell me I was\nnot in a condition to purchase the Louvre.\"\n\nD'Artagnan's bearing became still more imposing. Thanks to the sale\nof his horse, he commenced his career with four more crowns than M. de\nTreville possessed at the commencement of his.\n\n\"You ought, I say, then, to husband the means you have, however large\nthe sum may be; but you ought also to endeavor to perfect yourself in\nthe exercises becoming a gentleman. I will write a letter today to the\nDirector of the Royal Academy, and tomorrow he will admit you without\nany expense to yourself. Do not refuse this little service. Our\nbest-born and richest gentlemen sometimes solicit it without being able\nto obtain it. You will learn horsemanship, swordsmanship in all its\nbranches, and dancing. You will make some desirable acquaintances; and\nfrom time to time you can call upon me, just to tell me how you are\ngetting on, and to say whether I can be of further service to you.\"\n\nD'Artagnan, stranger as he was to all the manners of a court, could not\nbut perceive a little coldness in this reception.\n\n\"Alas, sir,\" said he, \"I cannot but perceive how sadly I miss the letter\nof introduction which my father gave me to present to you.\"\n\n\"I certainly am surprised,\" replied M. de Treville, \"that you should\nundertake so long a journey without that necessary passport, the sole\nresource of us poor Bearnese.\"\n\n\"I had one, sir, and, thank God, such as I could wish,\" cried\nd'Artagnan; \"but it was perfidiously stolen from me.\"\n\nHe then related the adventure of Meung, described the unknown gentleman\nwith the greatest minuteness, and all with a warmth and truthfulness\nthat delighted M. de Treville.\n\n\"This is all very strange,\" said M. de Treville, after meditating a\nminute; \"you mentioned my name, then, aloud?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I certainly committed that imprudence; but why should I have\ndone otherwise? A name like yours must be as a buckler to me on my way.\nJudge if I should not put myself under its protection.\"\n\nFlattery was at that period very current, and M. de Treville loved\nincense as well as a king, or even a cardinal. He could not refrain from\na smile of visible satisfaction; but this smile soon disappeared, and\nreturning to the adventure of Meung, \"Tell me,\" continued he, \"had not\nthis gentlemen a slight scar on his cheek?\"\n\n\"Yes, such a one as would be made by the grazing of a ball.\"\n\n\"Was he not a fine-looking man?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Of lofty stature.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Of complexion and brown hair?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, that is he; how is it, sir, that you are acquainted with this\nman? If I ever find him again--and I will find him, I swear, were it in\nhell!\"\n\n\"He was waiting for a woman,\" continued Treville.\n\n\"He departed immediately after having conversed for a minute with her\nwhom he awaited.\"\n\n\"You know not the subject of their conversation?\"\n\n\"He gave her a box, told her not to open it except in London.\"\n\n\"Was this woman English?\"\n\n\"He called her Milady.\"\n\n\"It is he; it must be he!\" murmured Treville. \"I believed him still at\nBrussels.\"\n\n\"Oh, sir, if you know who this man is,\" cried d'Artagnan, \"tell me\nwho he is, and whence he is. I will then release you from all your\npromises--even that of procuring my admission into the Musketeers; for\nbefore everything, I wish to avenge myself.\"\n\n\"Beware, young man!\" cried Treville. \"If you see him coming on one side\nof the street, pass by on the other. Do not cast yourself against such a\nrock; he would break you like glass.\"\n\n\"That will not prevent me,\" replied d'Artagnan, \"if ever I find him.\"\n\n\"In the meantime,\" said Treville, \"seek him not--if I have a right to\nadvise you.\"\n\nAll at once the captain stopped, as if struck by a sudden suspicion.\nThis great hatred which the young traveler manifested so loudly for this\nman, who--a rather improbable thing--had stolen his father's letter from\nhim--was there not some perfidy concealed under this hatred? Might not\nthis young man be sent by his Eminence? Might he not have come for the\npurpose of laying a snare for him? This pretended d'Artagnan--was he not\nan emissary of the cardinal, whom the cardinal sought to introduce\ninto Treville's house, to place near him, to win his confidence, and\nafterward to ruin him as had been done in a thousand other instances? He\nfixed his eyes upon d'Artagnan even more earnestly than before. He was\nmoderately reassured however, by the aspect of that countenance, full\nof astute intelligence and affected humility. \"I know he is a Gascon,\"\nreflected he, \"but he may be one for the cardinal as well as for me. Let\nus try him.\"\n\n\"My friend,\" said he, slowly, \"I wish, as the son of an ancient\nfriend--for I consider this story of the lost letter perfectly true--I\nwish, I say, in order to repair the coldness you may have remarked in my\nreception of you, to discover to you the secrets of our policy. The king\nand the cardinal are the best of friends; their apparent bickerings\nare only feints to deceive fools. I am not willing that a compatriot,\na handsome cavalier, a brave youth, quite fit to make his way, should\nbecome the dupe of all these artifices and fall into the snare after the\nexample of so many others who have been ruined by it. Be assured that\nI am devoted to both these all-powerful masters, and that my earnest\nendeavors have no other aim than the service of the king, and also the\ncardinal--one of the most illustrious geniuses that France has ever\nproduced.\n\n\"Now, young man, regulate your conduct accordingly; and if you\nentertain, whether from your family, your relations, or even from your\ninstincts, any of these enmities which we see constantly breaking out\nagainst the cardinal, bid me adieu and let us separate. I will aid you\nin many ways, but without attaching you to my person. I hope that my\nfrankness at least will make you my friend; for you are the only young\nman to whom I have hitherto spoken as I have done to you.\"\n\nTreville said to himself: \"If the cardinal has set this young fox upon\nme, he will certainly not have failed--he, who knows how bitterly I\nexecrate him--to tell his spy that the best means of making his court to\nme is to rail at him. Therefore, in spite of all my protestations, if\nit be as I suspect, my cunning gossip will assure me that he holds his\nEminence in horror.\"\n\nIt, however, proved otherwise. D'Artagnan answered, with the greatest\nsimplicity: \"I came to Paris with exactly such intentions. My\nfather advised me to stoop to nobody but the king, the cardinal, and\nyourself--whom he considered the first three personages in France.\"\n\nD'Artagnan added M. de Treville to the others, as may be perceived; but\nhe thought this addition would do no harm.\n\n\"I have the greatest veneration for the cardinal,\" continued he, \"and\nthe most profound respect for his actions. So much the better for me,\nsir, if you speak to me, as you say, with frankness--for then you will\ndo me the honor to esteem the resemblance of our opinions; but if you\nhave entertained any doubt, as naturally you may, I feel that I am\nruining myself by speaking the truth. But I still trust you will not\nesteem me the less for it, and that is my object beyond all others.\"\n\nM. de Treville was surprised to the greatest degree. So much\npenetration, so much frankness, created admiration, but did not entirely\nremove his suspicions. The more this young man was superior to others,\nthe more he was to be dreaded if he meant to deceive him; \"You are an\nhonest youth; but at the present moment I can only do for you that which\nI just now offered. My hotel will be always open to you. Hereafter,\nbeing able to ask for me at all hours, and consequently to take\nadvantage of all opportunities, you will probably obtain that which you\ndesire.\"\n\n\"That is to say,\" replied d'Artagnan, \"that you will wait until I\nhave proved myself worthy of it. Well, be assured,\" added he, with the\nfamiliarity of a Gascon, \"you shall not wait long.\" And he bowed in\norder to retire, and as if he considered the future in his own hands.\n\n\"But wait a minute,\" said M. de Treville, stopping him. \"I promised you\na letter for the director of the Academy. Are you too proud to accept\nit, young gentleman?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said d'Artagnan; \"and I will guard it so carefully that I\nwill be sworn it shall arrive at its address, and woe be to him who\nshall attempt to take it from me!\"\n\nM. de Treville smiled at this flourish; and leaving his young man\ncompatriot in the embrasure of the window, where they had talked\ntogether, he seated himself at a table in order to write the promised\nletter of recommendation. While he was doing this, d'Artagnan, having no\nbetter employment, amused himself with beating a march upon the window\nand with looking at the Musketeers, who went away, one after another,\nfollowing them with his eyes until they disappeared.\n\nM. de Treville, after having written the letter, sealed it, and rising,\napproached the young man in order to give it to him. But at the very\nmoment when d'Artagnan stretched out his hand to receive it, M. de\nTreville was highly astonished to see his protege make a sudden spring,\nbecome crimson with passion, and rush from the cabinet crying, \"S'blood,\nhe shall not escape me this time!\"\n\n\"And who?\" asked M. de Treville.\n\n\"He, my thief!\" replied d'Artagnan. \"Ah, the traitor!\" and he\ndisappeared.\n\n\"The devil take the madman!\" murmured M. de Treville, \"unless,\" added\nhe, \"this is a cunning mode of escaping, seeing that he had failed in\nhis purpose!\"\n\n\n\n\n4 THE SHOULDER OF ATHOS, THE BALDRIC OF PORTHOS AND THE HANDKERCHIEF OF\nARAMIS\n\nD'Artagnan, in a state of fury, crossed the antechamber at three bounds,\nand was darting toward the stairs, which he reckoned upon descending\nfour at a time, when, in his heedless course, he ran head foremost\nagainst a Musketeer who was coming out of one of M. de Treville's\nprivate rooms, and striking his shoulder violently, made him utter a\ncry, or rather a howl.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said d'Artagnan, endeavoring to resume his course, \"excuse\nme, but I am in a hurry.\"\n\nScarcely had he descended the first stair, when a hand of iron seized\nhim by the belt and stopped him.\n\n\"You are in a hurry?\" said the Musketeer, as pale as a sheet. \"Under\nthat pretense you run against me! You say. 'Excuse me,' and you believe\nthat is sufficient? Not at all my young man. Do you fancy because you\nhave heard Monsieur de Treville speak to us a little cavalierly\ntoday that other people are to treat us as he speaks to us? Undeceive\nyourself, comrade, you are not Monsieur de Treville.\"\n\n\"My faith!\" replied d'Artagnan, recognizing Athos, who, after the\ndressing performed by the doctor, was returning to his own apartment.\n\"I did not do it intentionally, and not doing it intentionally, I said\n'Excuse me.' It appears to me that this is quite enough. I repeat to\nyou, however, and this time on my word of honor--I think perhaps too\noften--that I am in haste, great haste. Leave your hold, then, I beg of\nyou, and let me go where my business calls me.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Athos, letting him go, \"you are not polite; it is easy\nto perceive that you come from a distance.\"\n\nD'Artagnan had already strode down three or four stairs, but at Athos's\nlast remark he stopped short.\n\n\"MORBLEU, monsieur!\" said he, \"however far I may come, it is not you who\ncan give me a lesson in good manners, I warn you.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Athos.\n\n\"Ah! If I were not in such haste, and if I were not running after\nsomeone,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Monsieur Man-in-a-hurry, you can find me without running--ME, you\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"And where, I pray you?\"\n\n\"Near the Carmes-Deschaux.\"\n\n\"At what hour?\"\n\n\"About noon.\"\n\n\"About noon? That will do; I will be there.\"\n\n\"Endeavor not to make me wait; for at quarter past twelve I will cut off\nyour ears as you run.\"\n\n\"Good!\" cried d'Artagnan, \"I will be there ten minutes before twelve.\"\nAnd he set off running as if the devil possessed him, hoping that he\nmight yet find the stranger, whose slow pace could not have carried him\nfar.\n\nBut at the street gate, Porthos was talking with the soldier on guard.\nBetween the two talkers there was just enough room for a man to pass.\nD'Artagnan thought it would suffice for him, and he sprang forward like\na dart between them. But d'Artagnan had reckoned without the wind. As\nhe was about to pass, the wind blew out Porthos's long cloak, and\nd'Artagnan rushed straight into the middle of it. Without doubt, Porthos\nhad reasons for not abandoning this part of his vestments, for instead\nof quitting his hold on the flap in his hand, he pulled it toward him,\nso that d'Artagnan rolled himself up in the velvet by a movement of\nrotation explained by the persistency of Porthos.\n\nD'Artagnan, hearing the Musketeer swear, wished to escape from the\ncloak, which blinded him, and sought to find his way from under the\nfolds of it. He was particularly anxious to avoid marring the freshness\nof the magnificent baldric we are acquainted with; but on timidly\nopening his eyes, he found himself with his nose fixed between the two\nshoulders of Porthos--that is to say, exactly upon the baldric.\n\nAlas, like most things in this world which have nothing in their favor\nbut appearances, the baldric was glittering with gold in the front,\nbut was nothing but simple buff behind. Vainglorious as he was, Porthos\ncould not afford to have a baldric wholly of gold, but had at least\nhalf. One could comprehend the necessity of the cold and the urgency of\nthe cloak.\n\n\"Bless me!\" cried Porthos, making strong efforts to disembarrass himself\nof d'Artagnan, who was wriggling about his back; \"you must be mad to run\nagainst people in this manner.\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said d'Artagnan, reappearing under the shoulder of the\ngiant, \"but I am in such haste--I was running after someone and--\"\n\n\"And do you always forget your eyes when you run?\" asked Porthos.\n\n\"No,\" replied d'Artagnan, piqued, \"and thanks to my eyes, I can see what\nother people cannot see.\"\n\nWhether Porthos understood him or did not understand him, giving way to\nhis anger, \"Monsieur,\" said he, \"you stand a chance of getting chastised\nif you rub Musketeers in this fashion.\"\n\n\"Chastised, Monsieur!\" said d'Artagnan, \"the expression is strong.\"\n\n\"It is one that becomes a man accustomed to look his enemies in the\nface.\"\n\n\"Ah, PARDIEU! I know full well that you don't turn your back to yours.\"\n\nAnd the young man, delighted with his joke, went away laughing loudly.\n\nPorthos foamed with rage, and made a movement to rush after d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Presently, presently,\" cried the latter, \"when you haven't your cloak\non.\"\n\n\"At one o'clock, then, behind the Luxembourg.\"\n\n\"Very well, at one o'clock, then,\" replied d'Artagnan, turning the angle\nof the street.\n\nBut neither in the street he had passed through, nor in the one which\nhis eager glance pervaded, could he see anyone; however slowly the\nstranger had walked, he was gone on his way, or perhaps had entered some\nhouse. D'Artagnan inquired of everyone he met with, went down to\nthe ferry, came up again by the Rue de Seine, and the Red Cross; but\nnothing, absolutely nothing! This chase was, however, advantageous to\nhim in one sense, for in proportion as the perspiration broke from his\nforehead, his heart began to cool.\n\nHe began to reflect upon the events that had passed; they were numerous\nand inauspicious. It was scarcely eleven o'clock in the morning, and yet\nthis morning had already brought him into disgrace with M. de Treville,\nwho could not fail to think the manner in which d'Artagnan had left him\na little cavalier.\n\nBesides this, he had drawn upon himself two good duels with two men,\neach capable of killing three d'Artagnans--with two Musketeers, in\nshort, with two of those beings whom he esteemed so greatly that he\nplaced them in his mind and heart above all other men.\n\nThe outlook was sad. Sure of being killed by Athos, it may easily be\nunderstood that the young man was not very uneasy about Porthos. As\nhope, however, is the last thing extinguished in the heart of man, he\nfinished by hoping that he might survive, even though with terrible\nwounds, in both these duels; and in case of surviving, he made the\nfollowing reprehensions upon his own conduct:\n\n\"What a madcap I was, and what a stupid fellow I am! That brave and\nunfortunate Athos was wounded on that very shoulder against which I must\nrun head foremost, like a ram. The only thing that astonishes me is that\nhe did not strike me dead at once. He had good cause to do so; the pain\nI gave him must have been atrocious. As to Porthos--oh, as to Porthos,\nfaith, that's a droll affair!\"\n\nAnd in spite of himself, the young man began to laugh aloud, looking\nround carefully, however, to see that his solitary laugh, without a\ncause in the eyes of passers-by, offended no one.\n\n\"As to Porthos, that is certainly droll; but I am not the less a giddy\nfool. Are people to be run against without warning? No! And have I any\nright to go and peep under their cloaks to see what is not there? He\nwould have pardoned me, he would certainly have pardoned me, if I had\nnot said anything to him about that cursed baldric--in ambiguous words,\nit is true, but rather drolly ambiguous. Ah, cursed Gascon that I am,\nI get from one hobble into another. Friend d'Artagnan,\" continued he,\nspeaking to himself with all the amenity that he thought due himself,\n\"if you escape, of which there is not much chance, I would advise you\nto practice perfect politeness for the future. You must henceforth be\nadmired and quoted as a model of it. To be obliging and polite does not\nnecessarily make a man a coward. Look at Aramis, now; Aramis is mildness\nand grace personified. Well, did anybody ever dream of calling Aramis a\ncoward? No, certainly not, and from this moment I will endeavor to model\nmyself after him. Ah! That's strange! Here he is!\"\n\nD'Artagnan, walking and soliloquizing, had arrived within a few steps\nof the hotel d'Arguillon and in front of that hotel perceived Aramis,\nchatting gaily with three gentlemen; but as he had not forgotten that it\nwas in presence of this young man that M. de Treville had been so\nangry in the morning, and as a witness of the rebuke the Musketeers had\nreceived was not likely to be at all agreeable, he pretended not to\nsee him. D'Artagnan, on the contrary, quite full of his plans of\nconciliation and courtesy, approached the young men with a profound bow,\naccompanied by a most gracious smile. All four, besides, immediately\nbroke off their conversation.\n\nD'Artagnan was not so dull as not to perceive that he was one too many;\nbut he was not sufficiently broken into the fashions of the gay world to\nknow how to extricate himself gallantly from a false position, like that\nof a man who begins to mingle with people he is scarcely acquainted with\nand in a conversation that does not concern him. He was seeking in his\nmind, then, for the least awkward means of retreat, when he remarked\nthat Aramis had let his handkerchief fall, and by mistake, no doubt, had\nplaced his foot upon it. This appeared to be a favorable opportunity\nto repair his intrusion. He stooped, and with the most gracious air he\ncould assume, drew the handkerchief from under the foot of the Musketeer\nin spite of the efforts the latter made to detain it, and holding it\nout to him, said, \"I believe, monsieur, that this is a handkerchief you\nwould be sorry to lose?\"\n\nThe handkerchief was indeed richly embroidered, and had a coronet and\narms at one of its corners. Aramis blushed excessively, and snatched\nrather than took the handkerchief from the hand of the Gascon.\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" cried one of the Guards, \"will you persist in saying,\nmost discreet Aramis, that you are not on good terms with Madame de\nBois-Tracy, when that gracious lady has the kindness to lend you one of\nher handkerchiefs?\"\n\nAramis darted at d'Artagnan one of those looks which inform a man that\nhe has acquired a mortal enemy. Then, resuming his mild air, \"You are\ndeceived, gentlemen,\" said he, \"this handkerchief is not mine, and I\ncannot fancy why Monsieur has taken it into his head to offer it to me\nrather than to one of you; and as a proof of what I say, here is mine in\nmy pocket.\"\n\nSo saying, he pulled out his own handkerchief, likewise a very elegant\nhandkerchief, and of fine cambric--though cambric was dear at the\nperiod--but a handkerchief without embroidery and without arms, only\nornamented with a single cipher, that of its proprietor.\n\nThis time d'Artagnan was not hasty. He perceived his mistake; but the\nfriends of Aramis were not at all convinced by his denial, and one of\nthem addressed the young Musketeer with affected seriousness. \"If\nit were as you pretend it is,\" said he, \"I should be forced, my dear\nAramis, to reclaim it myself; for, as you very well know, Bois-Tracy is\nan intimate friend of mine, and I cannot allow the property of his wife\nto be sported as a trophy.\"\n\n\"You make the demand badly,\" replied Aramis; \"and while acknowledging\nthe justice of your reclamation, I refuse it on account of the form.\"\n\n\"The fact is,\" hazarded d'Artagnan, timidly, \"I did not see the\nhandkerchief fall from the pocket of Monsieur Aramis. He had his foot\nupon it, that is all; and I thought from having his foot upon it the\nhandkerchief was his.\"\n\n\"And you were deceived, my dear sir,\" replied Aramis, coldly, very\nlittle sensible to the reparation. Then turning toward that one of the\nguards who had declared himself the friend of Bois-Tracy, \"Besides,\"\ncontinued he, \"I have reflected, my dear intimate of Bois-Tracy, that\nI am not less tenderly his friend than you can possibly be; so that\ndecidedly this handkerchief is as likely to have fallen from your pocket\nas mine.\"\n\n\"No, upon my honor!\" cried his Majesty's Guardsman.\n\n\"You are about to swear upon your honor and I upon my word, and then\nit will be pretty evident that one of us will have lied. Now, here,\nMontaran, we will do better than that--let each take a half.\"\n\n\"Of the handkerchief?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Perfectly just,\" cried the other two Guardsmen, \"the judgment of King\nSolomon! Aramis, you certainly are full of wisdom!\"\n\nThe young men burst into a laugh, and as may be supposed, the affair\nhad no other sequel. In a moment or two the conversation ceased, and the\nthree Guardsmen and the Musketeer, after having cordially shaken hands,\nseparated, the Guardsmen going one way and Aramis another.\n\n\"Now is my time to make peace with this gallant man,\" said d'Artagnan to\nhimself, having stood on one side during the whole of the latter part of\nthe conversation; and with this good feeling drawing near to Aramis, who\nwas departing without paying any attention to him, \"Monsieur,\" said he,\n\"you will excuse me, I hope.\"\n\n\"Ah, monsieur,\" interrupted Aramis, \"permit me to observe to you that\nyou have not acted in this affair as a gallant man ought.\"\n\n\"What, monsieur!\" cried d'Artagnan, \"and do you suppose--\"\n\n\"I suppose, monsieur that you are not a fool, and that you knew very\nwell, although coming from Gascony, that people do not tread upon\nhandkerchiefs without a reason. What the devil! Paris is not paved with\ncambric!\"\n\n\"Monsieur, you act wrongly in endeavoring to mortify me,\" said\nd'Artagnan, in whom the natural quarrelsome spirit began to speak more\nloudly than his pacific resolutions. \"I am from Gascony, it is true; and\nsince you know it, there is no occasion to tell you that Gascons are not\nvery patient, so that when they have begged to be excused once, were\nit even for a folly, they are convinced that they have done already at\nleast as much again as they ought to have done.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, what I say to you about the matter,\" said Aramis, \"is not for\nthe sake of seeking a quarrel. Thank God, I am not a bravo! And being\na Musketeer but for a time, I only fight when I am forced to do so, and\nalways with great repugnance; but this time the affair is serious, for\nhere is a lady compromised by you.\"\n\n\"By US, you mean!\" cried d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Why did you so maladroitly restore me the handkerchief?\"\n\n\"Why did you so awkwardly let it fall?\"\n\n\"I have said, monsieur, and I repeat, that the handkerchief did not fall\nfrom my pocket.\"\n\n\"And thereby you have lied twice, monsieur, for I saw it fall.\"\n\n\"Ah, you take it with that tone, do you, Master Gascon? Well, I will\nteach you how to behave yourself.\"\n\n\"And I will send you back to your Mass book, Master Abbe. Draw, if you\nplease, and instantly--\"\n\n\"Not so, if you please, my good friend--not here, at least. Do you not\nperceive that we are opposite the Hotel d'Arguillon, which is full of\nthe cardinal's creatures? How do I know that this is not his Eminence\nwho has honored you with the commission to procure my head? Now, I\nentertain a ridiculous partiality for my head, it seems to suit my\nshoulders so correctly. I wish to kill you, be at rest as to that, but\nto kill you quietly in a snug, remote place, where you will not be able\nto boast of your death to anybody.\"\n\n\"I agree, monsieur; but do not be too confident. Take your handkerchief;\nwhether it belongs to you or another, you may perhaps stand in need of\nit.\"\n\n\"Monsieur is a Gascon?\" asked Aramis.\n\n\"Yes. Monsieur does not postpone an interview through prudence?\"\n\n\"Prudence, monsieur, is a virtue sufficiently useless to Musketeers,\nI know, but indispensable to churchmen; and as I am only a Musketeer\nprovisionally, I hold it good to be prudent. At two o'clock I shall have\nthe honor of expecting you at the hotel of Monsieur de Treville. There I\nwill indicate to you the best place and time.\"\n\nThe two young men bowed and separated, Aramis ascending the street which\nled to the Luxembourg, while d'Artagnan, perceiving the appointed\nhour was approaching, took the road to the Carmes-Deschaux, saying to\nhimself, \"Decidedly I can't draw back; but at least, if I am killed, I\nshall be killed by a Musketeer.\"\n\n\n\n\n5 THE KING'S MUSKETEERS AND THE CARDINAL'S GUARDS\n\nD'Artagnan was acquainted with nobody in Paris. He went therefore to his\nappointment with Athos without a second, determined to be satisfied with\nthose his adversary should choose. Besides, his intention was formed to\nmake the brave Musketeer all suitable apologies, but without meanness\nor weakness, fearing that might result from this duel which generally\nresults from an affair of this kind, when a young and vigorous man\nfights with an adversary who is wounded and weakened--if conquered, he\ndoubles the triumph of his antagonist; if a conqueror, he is accused of\nfoul play and want of courage.\n\nNow, we must have badly painted the character of our adventure seeker,\nor our readers must have already perceived that d'Artagnan was not an\nordinary man; therefore, while repeating to himself that his death was\ninevitable, he did not make up his mind to die quietly, as one less\ncourageous and less restrained might have done in his place. He\nreflected upon the different characters of men he had to fight with, and\nbegan to view his situation more clearly. He hoped, by means of loyal\nexcuses, to make a friend of Athos, whose lordly air and austere bearing\npleased him much. He flattered himself he should be able to frighten\nPorthos with the adventure of the baldric, which he might, if not killed\nupon the spot, relate to everybody a recital which, well managed,\nwould cover Porthos with ridicule. As to the astute Aramis, he did not\nentertain much dread of him; and supposing he should be able to get so\nfar, he determined to dispatch him in good style or at least, by hitting\nhim in the face, as Caesar recommended his soldiers do to those of\nPompey, to damage forever the beauty of which he was so proud.\n\nIn addition to this, d'Artagnan possessed that invincible stock of\nresolution which the counsels of his father had implanted in his heart:\n\"Endure nothing from anyone but the king, the cardinal, and Monsieur de\nTreville.\" He flew, then, rather than walked, toward the convent of the\nCarmes Dechausses, or rather Deschaux, as it was called at that period,\na sort of building without a window, surrounded by barren fields--an\naccessory to the Preaux-Clercs, and which was generally employed as the\nplace for the duels of men who had no time to lose.\n\nWhen d'Artagnan arrived in sight of the bare spot of ground which\nextended along the foot of the monastery, Athos had been waiting about\nfive minutes, and twelve o'clock was striking. He was, then, as punctual\nas the Samaritan woman, and the most rigorous casuist with regard to\nduels could have nothing to say.\n\nAthos, who still suffered grievously from his wound, though it had\nbeen dressed anew by M. de Treville's surgeon, was seated on a post and\nwaiting for his adversary with hat in hand, his feather even touching\nthe ground.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Athos, \"I have engaged two of my friends as seconds;\nbut these two friends are not yet come, at which I am astonished, as it\nis not at all their custom.\"\n\n\"I have no seconds on my part, monsieur,\" said d'Artagnan; \"for having\nonly arrived yesterday in Paris, I as yet know no one but Monsieur de\nTreville, to whom I was recommended by my father, who has the honor to\nbe, in some degree, one of his friends.\"\n\nAthos reflected for an instant. \"You know no one but Monsieur de\nTreville?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, I know only him.\"\n\n\"Well, but then,\" continued Athos, speaking half to himself, \"if I kill\nyou, I shall have the air of a boy-slayer.\"\n\n\"Not too much so,\" replied d'Artagnan, with a bow that was not deficient\nin dignity, \"since you do me the honor to draw a sword with me while\nsuffering from a wound which is very inconvenient.\"\n\n\"Very inconvenient, upon my word; and you hurt me devilishly, I can\ntell you. But I will take the left hand--it is my custom in such\ncircumstances. Do not fancy that I do you a favor; I use either hand\neasily. And it will be even a disadvantage to you; a left-handed man is\nvery troublesome to people who are not prepared for it. I regret I did\nnot inform you sooner of this circumstance.\"\n\n\"You have truly, monsieur,\" said d'Artagnan, bowing again, \"a courtesy,\nfor which, I assure you, I am very grateful.\"\n\n\"You confuse me,\" replied Athos, with his gentlemanly air; \"let us talk\nof something else, if you please. Ah, s'blood, how you have hurt me! My\nshoulder quite burns.\"\n\n\"If you would permit me--\" said d'Artagnan, with timidity.\n\n\"What, monsieur?\"\n\n\"I have a miraculous balsam for wounds--a balsam given to me by my\nmother and of which I have made a trial upon myself.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, I am sure that in less than three days this balsam would cure\nyou; and at the end of three days, when you would be cured--well, sir,\nit would still do me a great honor to be your man.\"\n\nD'Artagnan spoke these words with a simplicity that did honor to his\ncourtesy, without throwing the least doubt upon his courage.\n\n\"PARDIEU, monsieur!\" said Athos, \"that's a proposition that pleases me;\nnot that I can accept it, but a league off it savors of the gentleman.\nThus spoke and acted the gallant knights of the time of Charlemagne, in\nwhom every cavalier ought to seek his model. Unfortunately, we do not\nlive in the times of the great emperor, we live in the times of the\ncardinal; and three days hence, however well the secret might be\nguarded, it would be known, I say, that we were to fight, and our combat\nwould be prevented. I think these fellows will never come.\"\n\n\"If you are in haste, monsieur,\" said d'Artagnan, with the same\nsimplicity with which a moment before he had proposed to him to put off\nthe duel for three days, \"and if it be your will to dispatch me at once,\ndo not inconvenience yourself, I pray you.\"\n\n\"There is another word which pleases me,\" cried Athos, with a gracious\nnod to d'Artagnan. \"That did not come from a man without a heart.\nMonsieur, I love men of your kidney; and I foresee plainly that if we\ndon't kill each other, I shall hereafter have much pleasure in your\nconversation. We will wait for these gentlemen, so please you; I have\nplenty of time, and it will be more correct. Ah, here is one of them, I\nbelieve.\"\n\nIn fact, at the end of the Rue Vaugirard the gigantic Porthos appeared.\n\n\"What!\" cried d'Artagnan, \"is your first witness Monsieur Porthos?\"\n\n\"Yes, that disturbs you?\"\n\n\"By no means.\"\n\n\"And here is the second.\"\n\nD'Artagnan turned in the direction pointed to by Athos, and perceived\nAramis.\n\n\"What!\" cried he, in an accent of greater astonishment than before,\n\"your second witness is Monsieur Aramis?\"\n\n\"Doubtless! Are you not aware that we are never seen one without the\nothers, and that we are called among the Musketeers and the Guards,\nat court and in the city, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, or the Three\nInseparables? And yet, as you come from Dax or Pau--\"\n\n\"From Tarbes,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"It is probable you are ignorant of this little fact,\" said Athos.\n\n\"My faith!\" replied d'Artagnan, \"you are well named, gentlemen; and my\nadventure, if it should make any noise, will prove at least that your\nunion is not founded upon contrasts.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Porthos had come up, waved his hand to Athos, and then\nturning toward d'Artagnan, stood quite astonished.\n\nLet us say in passing that he had changed his baldric and relinquished\nhis cloak.\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" said he, \"what does this mean?\"\n\n\"This is the gentleman I am going to fight with,\" said Athos, pointing\nto d'Artagnan with his hand and saluting him with the same gesture.\n\n\"Why, it is with him I am also going to fight,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"But not before one o'clock,\" replied d'Artagnan.\n\n\"And I also am to fight with this gentleman,\" said Aramis, coming in his\nturn onto the place.\n\n\"But not until two o'clock,\" said d'Artagnan, with the same calmness.\n\n\"But what are you going to fight about, Athos?\" asked Aramis.\n\n\"Faith! I don't very well know. He hurt my shoulder. And you, Porthos?\"\n\n\"Faith! I am going to fight--because I am going to fight,\" answered\nPorthos, reddening.\n\nAthos, whose keen eye lost nothing, perceived a faintly sly smile\npass over the lips of the young Gascon as he replied, \"We had a short\ndiscussion upon dress.\"\n\n\"And you, Aramis?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"Oh, ours is a theological quarrel,\" replied Aramis, making a sign to\nd'Artagnan to keep secret the cause of their duel.\n\nAthos indeed saw a second smile on the lips of d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Indeed?\" said Athos.\n\n\"Yes; a passage of St. Augustine, upon which we could not agree,\" said\nthe Gascon.\n\n\"Decidedly, this is a clever fellow,\" murmured Athos.\n\n\"And now you are assembled, gentlemen,\" said d'Artagnan, \"permit me to\noffer you my apologies.\"\n\nAt this word APOLOGIES, a cloud passed over the brow of Athos, a haughty\nsmile curled the lip of Porthos, and a negative sign was the reply of\nAramis.\n\n\"You do not understand me, gentlemen,\" said d'Artagnan, throwing up his\nhead, the sharp and bold lines of which were at the moment gilded by a\nbright ray of the sun. \"I asked to be excused in case I should not be\nable to discharge my debt to all three; for Monsieur Athos has the right\nto kill me first, which must much diminish the face-value of your bill,\nMonsieur Porthos, and render yours almost null, Monsieur Aramis. And\nnow, gentlemen, I repeat, excuse me, but on that account only, and--on\nguard!\"\n\nAt these words, with the most gallant air possible, d'Artagnan drew his\nsword.\n\nThe blood had mounted to the head of d'Artagnan, and at that moment he\nwould have drawn his sword against all the Musketeers in the kingdom as\nwillingly as he now did against Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.\n\nIt was a quarter past midday. The sun was in its zenith, and the spot\nchosen for the scene of the duel was exposed to its full ardor.\n\n\"It is very hot,\" said Athos, drawing his sword in its turn, \"and yet I\ncannot take off my doublet; for I just now felt my wound begin to bleed\nagain, and I should not like to annoy Monsieur with the sight of blood\nwhich he has not drawn from me himself.\"\n\n\"That is true, Monsieur,\" replied d'Artagnan, \"and whether drawn by\nmyself or another, I assure you I shall always view with regret the\nblood of so brave a gentleman. I will therefore fight in my doublet,\nlike yourself.\"\n\n\"Come, come, enough of such compliments!\" cried Porthos. \"Remember, we\nare waiting for our turns.\"\n\n\"Speak for yourself when you are inclined to utter such incongruities,\"\ninterrupted Aramis. \"For my part, I think what they say is very well\nsaid, and quite worthy of two gentlemen.\"\n\n\"When you please, monsieur,\" said Athos, putting himself on guard.\n\n\"I waited your orders,\" said d'Artagnan, crossing swords.\n\nBut scarcely had the two rapiers clashed, when a company of the Guards\nof his Eminence, commanded by M. de Jussac, turned the corner of the\nconvent.\n\n\"The cardinal's Guards!\" cried Aramis and Porthos at the same time.\n\"Sheathe your swords, gentlemen, sheathe your swords!\"\n\nBut it was too late. The two combatants had been seen in a position\nwhich left no doubt of their intentions.\n\n\"Halloo!\" cried Jussac, advancing toward them and making a sign to his\nmen to do so likewise, \"halloo, Musketeers? Fighting here, are you? And\nthe edicts? What is become of them?\"\n\n\"You are very generous, gentlemen of the Guards,\" said Athos, full of\nrancor, for Jussac was one of the aggressors of the preceding day. \"If\nwe were to see you fighting, I can assure you that we would make no\neffort to prevent you. Leave us alone, then, and you will enjoy a little\namusement without cost to yourselves.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Jussac, \"it is with great regret that I pronounce the\nthing impossible. Duty before everything. Sheathe, then, if you please,\nand follow us.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Aramis, parodying Jussac, \"it would afford us great\npleasure to obey your polite invitation if it depended upon ourselves;\nbut unfortunately the thing is impossible--Monsieur de Treville has\nforbidden it. Pass on your way, then; it is the best thing to do.\"\n\nThis raillery exasperated Jussac. \"We will charge upon you, then,\" said\nhe, \"if you disobey.\"\n\n\"There are five of them,\" said Athos, half aloud, \"and we are but three;\nwe shall be beaten again, and must die on the spot, for, on my part,\nI declare I will never appear again before the captain as a conquered\nman.\"\n\nAthos, Porthos, and Aramis instantly drew near one another, while Jussac\ndrew up his soldiers.\n\nThis short interval was sufficient to determine d'Artagnan on the part\nhe was to take. It was one of those events which decide the life of a\nman; it was a choice between the king and the cardinal--the choice made,\nit must be persisted in. To fight, that was to disobey the law, that was\nto risk his head, that was to make at one blow an enemy of a minister\nmore powerful than the king himself. All this young man perceived, and\nyet, to his praise we speak it, he did not hesitate a second. Turning\ntowards Athos and his friends, \"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"allow me to\ncorrect your words, if you please. You said you were but three, but it\nappears to me we are four.\"\n\n\"But you are not one of us,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"That's true,\" replied d'Artagnan; \"I have not the uniform, but I have\nthe spirit. My heart is that of a Musketeer; I feel it, monsieur, and\nthat impels me on.\"\n\n\"Withdraw, young man,\" cried Jussac, who doubtless, by his gestures and\nthe expression of his countenance, had guessed d'Artagnan's design. \"You\nmay retire; we consent to that. Save your skin; begone quickly.\"\n\nD'Artagnan did not budge.\n\n\"Decidedly, you are a brave fellow,\" said Athos, pressing the young\nman's hand.\n\n\"Come, come, choose your part,\" replied Jussac.\n\n\"Well,\" said Porthos to Aramis, \"we must do something.\"\n\n\"Monsieur is full of generosity,\" said Athos.\n\nBut all three reflected upon the youth of d'Artagnan, and dreaded his\ninexperience.\n\n\"We should only be three, one of whom is wounded, with the addition of a\nboy,\" resumed Athos; \"and yet it will not be the less said we were four\nmen.\"\n\n\"Yes, but to yield!\" said Porthos.\n\n\"That IS difficult,\" replied Athos.\n\nD'Artagnan comprehended their irresolution.\n\n\"Try me, gentlemen,\" said he, \"and I swear to you by my honor that I\nwill not go hence if we are conquered.\"\n\n\"What is your name, my brave fellow?\" said Athos.\n\n\"d'Artagnan, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Well, then, Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and d'Artagnan, forward!\" cried\nAthos.\n\n\"Come, gentlemen, have you decided?\" cried Jussac for the third time.\n\n\"It is done, gentlemen,\" said Athos.\n\n\"And what is your choice?\" asked Jussac.\n\n\"We are about to have the honor of charging you,\" replied Aramis,\nlifting his hat with one hand and drawing his sword with the other.\n\n\"Ah! You resist, do you?\" cried Jussac.\n\n\"S'blood; does that astonish you?\"\n\nAnd the nine combatants rushed upon each other with a fury which however\ndid not exclude a certain degree of method.\n\nAthos fixed upon a certain Cahusac, a favorite of the cardinal's.\nPorthos had Bicarat, and Aramis found himself opposed to two\nadversaries. As to d'Artagnan, he sprang toward Jussac himself.\n\nThe heart of the young Gascon beat as if it would burst through his\nside--not from fear, God be thanked, he had not the shade of it, but\nwith emulation; he fought like a furious tiger, turning ten times round\nhis adversary, and changing his ground and his guard twenty times.\nJussac was, as was then said, a fine blade, and had had much practice;\nnevertheless it required all his skill to defend himself against\nan adversary who, active and energetic, departed every instant from\nreceived rules, attacking him on all sides at once, and yet parrying\nlike a man who had the greatest respect for his own epidermis.\n\nThis contest at length exhausted Jussac's patience. Furious at being\nheld in check by one whom he had considered a boy, he became warm and\nbegan to make mistakes. D'Artagnan, who though wanting in practice had\na sound theory, redoubled his agility. Jussac, anxious to put an end to\nthis, springing forward, aimed a terrible thrust at his adversary, but\nthe latter parried it; and while Jussac was recovering himself, glided\nlike a serpent beneath his blade, and passed his sword through his body.\nJussac fell like a dead mass.\n\nD'Artagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of\nbattle.\n\nAramis had killed one of his adversaries, but the other pressed him\nwarmly. Nevertheless, Aramis was in a good situation, and able to defend\nhimself.\n\nBicarat and Porthos had just made counterhits. Porthos had received a\nthrust through his arm, and Bicarat one through his thigh. But neither\nof these two wounds was serious, and they only fought more earnestly.\n\nAthos, wounded anew by Cahusac, became evidently paler, but did not give\nway a foot. He only changed his sword hand, and fought with his left\nhand.\n\nAccording to the laws of dueling at that period, d'Artagnan was at\nliberty to assist whom he pleased. While he was endeavoring to find out\nwhich of his companions stood in greatest need, he caught a glance from\nAthos. The glance was of sublime eloquence. Athos would have died\nrather than appeal for help; but he could look, and with that look ask\nassistance. D'Artagnan interpreted it; with a terrible bound he sprang\nto the side of Cahusac, crying, \"To me, Monsieur Guardsman; I will slay\nyou!\"\n\nCahusac turned. It was time; for Athos, whose great courage alone\nsupported him, sank upon his knee.\n\n\"S'blood!\" cried he to d'Artagnan, \"do not kill him, young man, I beg of\nyou. I have an old affair to settle with him when I am cured and sound\nagain. Disarm him only--make sure of his sword. That's it! Very well\ndone!\"\n\nThe exclamation was drawn from Athos by seeing the sword of Cahusac fly\ntwenty paces from him. D'Artagnan and Cahusac sprang forward at the\nsame instant, the one to recover, the other to obtain, the sword; but\nd'Artagnan, being the more active, reached it first and placed his foot\nupon it.\n\nCahusac immediately ran to the Guardsman whom Aramis had killed, seized\nhis rapier, and returned toward d'Artagnan; but on his way he met Athos,\nwho during his relief which d'Artagnan had procured him had recovered\nhis breath, and who, for fear that d'Artagnan would kill his enemy,\nwished to resume the fight.\n\nD'Artagnan perceived that it would be disobliging Athos not to leave him\nalone; and in a few minutes Cahusac fell, with a sword thrust through\nhis throat.\n\nAt the same instant Aramis placed his sword point on the breast of his\nfallen enemy, and forced him to ask for mercy.\n\nThere only then remained Porthos and Bicarat. Porthos made a thousand\nflourishes, asking Bicarat what o'clock it could be, and offering him\nhis compliments upon his brother's having just obtained a company in the\nregiment of Navarre; but, jest as he might, he gained nothing. Bicarat\nwas one of those iron men who never fell dead.\n\nNevertheless, it was necessary to finish. The watch might come up and\ntake all the combatants, wounded or not, royalists or cardinalists.\nAthos, Aramis, and d'Artagnan surrounded Bicarat, and required him\nto surrender. Though alone against all and with a wound in his thigh,\nBicarat wished to hold out; but Jussac, who had risen upon his elbow,\ncried out to him to yield. Bicarat was a Gascon, as d'Artagnan was; he\nturned a deaf ear, and contented himself with laughing, and between two\nparries finding time to point to a spot of earth with his sword, \"Here,\"\ncried he, parodying a verse of the Bible, \"here will Bicarat die; for I\nonly am left, and they seek my life.\"\n\n\"But there are four against you; leave off, I command you.\"\n\n\"Ah, if you command me, that's another thing,\" said Bicarat. \"As you are\nmy commander, it is my duty to obey.\" And springing backward, he broke\nhis sword across his knee to avoid the necessity of surrendering it,\nthrew the pieces over the convent wall, and crossed him arms, whistling\na cardinalist air.\n\nBravery is always respected, even in an enemy. The Musketeers saluted\nBicarat with their swords, and returned them to their sheaths.\nD'Artagnan did the same. Then, assisted by Bicarat, the only one left\nstanding, he bore Jussac, Cahusac, and one of Aramis's adversaries who\nwas only wounded, under the porch of the convent. The fourth, as we have\nsaid, was dead. They then rang the bell, and carrying away four swords\nout of five, they took their road, intoxicated with joy, toward the\nhotel of M. de Treville.\n\nThey walked arm in arm, occupying the whole width of the street and\ntaking in every Musketeer they met, so that in the end it became a\ntriumphal march. The heart of d'Artagnan swam in delirium; he marched\nbetween Athos and Porthos, pressing them tenderly.\n\n\"If I am not yet a Musketeer,\" said he to his new friends, as he passed\nthrough the gateway of M. de Treville's hotel, \"at least I have entered\nupon my apprenticeship, haven't I?\"\n\n\n\n\n6 HIS MAJESTY KING LOUIS XIII\n\nThis affair made a great noise. M. de Treville scolded his Musketeers in\npublic, and congratulated them in private; but as no time was to be lost\nin gaining the king, M. de Treville hastened to report himself at\nthe Louvre. It was already too late. The king was closeted with the\ncardinal, and M. de Treville was informed that the king was busy and\ncould not receive him at that moment. In the evening M. de Treville\nattended the king's gaming table. The king was winning; and as he was\nvery avaricious, he was in an excellent humor. Perceiving M. de Treville\nat a distance--\n\n\"Come here, Monsieur Captain,\" said he, \"come here, that I may growl\nat you. Do you know that his Eminence has been making fresh complaints\nagainst your Musketeers, and that with so much emotion, that this\nevening his Eminence is indisposed? Ah, these Musketeers of yours are\nvery devils--fellows to be hanged.\"\n\n\"No, sire,\" replied Treville, who saw at the first glance how things\nwould go, \"on the contrary, they are good creatures, as meek as lambs,\nand have but one desire, I'll be their warranty. And that is that their\nswords may never leave their scabbards but in your majesty's service.\nBut what are they to do? The Guards of Monsieur the Cardinal are forever\nseeking quarrels with them, and for the honor of the corps even, the\npoor young men are obliged to defend themselves.\"\n\n\"Listen to Monsieur de Treville,\" said the king; \"listen to him! Would\nnot one say he was speaking of a religious community? In truth, my dear\nCaptain, I have a great mind to take away your commission and give it to\nMademoiselle de Chemerault, to whom I promised an abbey. But don't fancy\nthat I am going to take you on your bare word. I am called Louis the\nJust, Monsieur de Treville, and by and by, by and by we will see.\"\n\n\"Ah, sire; it is because I confide in that justice that I shall wait\npatiently and quietly the good pleasure of your Majesty.\"\n\n\n\"Wait, then, monsieur, wait,\" said the king; \"I will not detain you\nlong.\"\n\nIn fact, fortune changed; and as the king began to lose what he had won,\nhe was not sorry to find an excuse for playing Charlemagne--if we may\nuse a gaming phrase of whose origin we confess our ignorance. The king\ntherefore arose a minute after, and putting the money which lay before\nhim into his pocket, the major part of which arose from his winnings,\n\"La Vieuville,\" said he, \"take my place; I must speak to Monsieur de\nTreville on an affair of importance. Ah, I had eighty louis before me;\nput down the same sum, so that they who have lost may have nothing to\ncomplain of. Justice before everything.\"\n\nThen turning toward M. de Treville and walking with him toward the\nembrasure of a window, \"Well, monsieur,\" continued he, \"you say it is\nhis Eminence's Guards who have sought a quarrel with your Musketeers?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, as they always do.\"\n\n\"And how did the thing happen? Let us see, for you know, my dear\nCaptain, a judge must hear both sides.\"\n\n\"Good Lord! In the most simple and natural manner possible. Three of my\nbest soldiers, whom your Majesty knows by name, and whose devotedness\nyou have more than once appreciated, and who have, I dare affirm to\nthe king, his service much at heart--three of my best soldiers, I say,\nAthos, Porthos, and Aramis, had made a party of pleasure with a young\nfellow from Gascony, whom I had introduced to them the same morning.\nThe party was to take place at St. Germain, I believe, and they had\nappointed to meet at the Carmes-Deschaux, when they were disturbed by de\nJussac, Cahusac, Bicarat, and two other Guardsmen, who certainly did not\ngo there in such a numerous company without some ill intention against\nthe edicts.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah! You incline me to think so,\" said the king. \"There is no doubt\nthey went thither to fight themselves.\"\n\n\"I do not accuse them, sire; but I leave your Majesty to judge what five\narmed men could possibly be going to do in such a deserted place as the\nneighborhood of the Convent des Carmes.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are right, Treville, you are right!\"\n\n\"Then, upon seeing my Musketeers they changed their minds, and forgot\ntheir private hatred for partisan hatred; for your Majesty cannot be\nignorant that the Musketeers, who belong to the king and nobody but\nthe king, are the natural enemies of the Guardsmen, who belong to the\ncardinal.\"\n\n\"Yes, Treville, yes,\" said the king, in a melancholy tone; \"and it is\nvery sad, believe me, to see thus two parties in France, two heads to\nroyalty. But all this will come to an end, Treville, will come to\nan end. You say, then, that the Guardsmen sought a quarrel with the\nMusketeers?\"\n\n\"I say that it is probable that things have fallen out so, but I will\nnot swear to it, sire. You know how difficult it is to discover the\ntruth; and unless a man be endowed with that admirable instinct which\ncauses Louis XIII to be named the Just--\"\n\n\n\"You are right, Treville; but they were not alone, your Musketeers. They\nhad a youth with them?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, and one wounded man; so that three of the king's\nMusketeers--one of whom was wounded--and a youth not only maintained\ntheir ground against five of the most terrible of the cardinal's\nGuardsmen, but absolutely brought four of them to earth.\"\n\n\"Why, this is a victory!\" cried the king, all radiant, \"a complete\nvictory!\"\n\n\"Yes, sire; as complete as that of the Bridge of Ce.\"\n\n\"Four men, one of them wounded, and a youth, say you?\"\n\n\"One hardly a young man; but who, however, behaved himself so admirably\non this occasion that I will take the liberty of recommending him to\nyour Majesty.\"\n\n\"How does he call himself?\"\n\n\"d'Artagnan, sire; he is the son of one of my oldest friends--the son of\na man who served under the king your father, of glorious memory, in the\ncivil war.\"\n\n\"And you say this young man behaved himself well? Tell me how,\nTreville--you know how I delight in accounts of war and fighting.\"\n\nAnd Louis XIII twisted his mustache proudly, placing his hand upon his\nhip.\n\n\"Sire,\" resumed Treville, \"as I told you, Monsieur d'Artagnan is little\nmore than a boy; and as he has not the honor of being a Musketeer, he\nwas dressed as a citizen. The Guards of the cardinal, perceiving his\nyouth and that he did not belong to the corps, invited him to retire\nbefore they attacked.\"\n\n\"So you may plainly see, Treville,\" interrupted the king, \"it was they\nwho attacked?\"\n\n\"That is true, sire; there can be no more doubt on that head. They\ncalled upon him then to retire; but he answered that he was a Musketeer\nat heart, entirely devoted to your Majesty, and that therefore he would\nremain with Messieurs the Musketeers.\"\n\n\"Brave young man!\" murmured the king.\n\n\"Well, he did remain with them; and your Majesty has in him so firm a\nchampion that it was he who gave Jussac the terrible sword thrust which\nhas made the cardinal so angry.\"\n\n\"He who wounded Jussac!\" cried the king, \"he, a boy! Treville, that's\nimpossible!\"\n\n\"It is as I have the honor to relate it to your Majesty.\"\n\n\"Jussac, one of the first swordsmen in the kingdom?\"\n\n\"Well, sire, for once he found his master.\"\n\n\"I will see this young man, Treville--I will see him; and if anything\ncan be done--well, we will make it our business.\"\n\n\"When will your Majesty deign to receive him?\"\n\n\"Tomorrow, at midday, Treville.\"\n\n\"Shall I bring him alone?\"\n\n\"No, bring me all four together. I wish to thank them all at once.\nDevoted men are so rare, Treville, by the back staircase. It is useless\nto let the cardinal know.\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"You understand, Treville--an edict is still an edict, it is forbidden\nto fight, after all.\"\n\n\"But this encounter, sire, is quite out of the ordinary conditions of\na duel. It is a brawl; and the proof is that there were five of\nthe cardinal's Guardsmen against my three Musketeers and Monsieur\nd'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said the king; \"but never mind, Treville, come still by\nthe back staircase.\"\n\nTreville smiled; but as it was indeed something to have prevailed\nupon this child to rebel against his master, he saluted the king\nrespectfully, and with this agreement, took leave of him.\n\nThat evening the three Musketeers were informed of the honor accorded\nthem. As they had long been acquainted with the king, they were not\nmuch excited; but d'Artagnan, with his Gascon imagination, saw in it his\nfuture fortune, and passed the night in golden dreams. By eight o'clock\nin the morning he was at the apartment of Athos.\n\nD'Artagnan found the Musketeer dressed and ready to go out. As the hour\nto wait upon the king was not till twelve, he had made a party with\nPorthos and Aramis to play a game at tennis in a tennis court situated\nnear the stables of the Luxembourg. Athos invited d'Artagnan to follow\nthem; and although ignorant of the game, which he had never played, he\naccepted, not knowing what to do with his time from nine o'clock in the\nmorning, as it then scarcely was, till twelve.\n\nThe two Musketeers were already there, and were playing together. Athos,\nwho was very expert in all bodily exercises, passed with d'Artagnan to\nthe opposite side and challenged them; but at the first effort he made,\nalthough he played with his left hand, he found that his wound was yet\ntoo recent to allow of such exertion. D'Artagnan remained, therefore,\nalone; and as he declared he was too ignorant of the game to play\nit regularly they only continued giving balls to one another without\ncounting. But one of these balls, launched by Porthos' herculean hand,\npassed so close to d'Artagnan's face that he thought that if, instead\nof passing near, it had hit him, his audience would have been probably\nlost, as it would have been impossible for him to present himself\nbefore the king. Now, as upon this audience, in his Gascon imagination,\ndepended his future life, he saluted Aramis and Porthos politely,\ndeclaring that he would not resume the game until he should be prepared\nto play with them on more equal terms, and went and took his place near\nthe cord and in the gallery.\n\nUnfortunately for d'Artagnan, among the spectators was one of his\nEminence's Guardsmen, who, still irritated by the defeat of his\ncompanions, which had happened only the day before, had promised\nhimself to seize the first opportunity of avenging it. He believed\nthis opportunity was now come and addressed his neighbor: \"It is not\nastonishing that that young man should be afraid of a ball, for he is\ndoubtless a Musketeer apprentice.\"\n\nD'Artagnan turned round as if a serpent had stung him, and fixed his\neyes intensely upon the Guardsman who had just made this insolent\nspeech.\n\n\"PARDIEU,\" resumed the latter, twisting his mustache, \"look at me as\nlong as you like, my little gentleman! I have said what I have said.\"\n\n\"And as since that which you have said is too clear to require any\nexplanation,\" replied d'Artagnan, in a low voice, \"I beg you to follow\nme.\"\n\n\"And when?\" asked the Guardsman, with the same jeering air.\n\n\"At once, if you please.\"\n\n\"And you know who I am, without doubt?\"\n\n\"I? I am completely ignorant; nor does it much disquiet me.\"\n\n\"You're in the wrong there; for if you knew my name, perhaps you would\nnot be so pressing.\"\n\n\"What is your name?\"\n\n\"Bernajoux, at your service.\"\n\n\"Well, then, Monsieur Bernajoux,\" said d'Artagnan, tranquilly, \"I will\nwait for you at the door.\"\n\n\"Go, monsieur, I will follow you.\"\n\n\"Do not hurry yourself, monsieur, lest it be observed that we go out\ntogether. You must be aware that for our undertaking, company would be\nin the way.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said the Guardsman, astonished that his name had not\nproduced more effect upon the young man.\n\nIndeed, the name of Bernajoux was known to all the world, d'Artagnan\nalone excepted, perhaps; for it was one of those which figured most\nfrequently in the daily brawls which all the edicts of the cardinal\ncould not repress.\n\nPorthos and Aramis were so engaged with their game, and Athos was\nwatching them with so much attention, that they did not even perceive\ntheir young companion go out, who, as he had told the Guardsman of his\nEminence, stopped outside the door. An instant after, the Guardsman\ndescended in his turn. As d'Artagnan had no time to lose, on account of\nthe audience of the king, which was fixed for midday, he cast his eyes\naround, and seeing that the street was empty, said to his adversary, \"My\nfaith! It is fortunate for you, although your name is Bernajoux, to have\nonly to deal with an apprentice Musketeer. Never mind; be content, I\nwill do my best. On guard!\"\n\n\"But,\" said he whom d'Artagnan thus provoked, \"it appears to me that\nthis place is badly chosen, and that we should be better behind the\nAbbey St. Germain or in the Pre-aux-Clercs.\"\n\n\"What you say is full of sense,\" replied d'Artagnan; \"but unfortunately\nI have very little time to spare, having an appointment at twelve\nprecisely. On guard, then, monsieur, on guard!\"\n\nBernajoux was not a man to have such a compliment paid to him twice.\nIn an instant his sword glittered in his hand, and he sprang upon\nhis adversary, whom, thanks to his great youthfulness, he hoped to\nintimidate.\n\nBut d'Artagnan had on the preceding day served his apprenticeship. Fresh\nsharpened by his victory, full of hopes of future favor, he was resolved\nnot to recoil a step. So the two swords were crossed close to the\nhilts, and as d'Artagnan stood firm, it was his adversary who made the\nretreating step; but d'Artagnan seized the moment at which, in this\nmovement, the sword of Bernajoux deviated from the line. He freed\nhis weapon, made a lunge, and touched his adversary on the shoulder.\nd'Artagnan immediately made a step backward and raised his sword; but\nBernajoux cried out that it was nothing, and rushing blindly upon him,\nabsolutely spitted himself upon d'Artagnan's sword. As, however, he did\nnot fall, as he did not declare himself conquered, but only broke away\ntoward the hotel of M. de la Tremouille, in whose service he had a\nrelative, d'Artagnan was ignorant of the seriousness of the last wound\nhis adversary had received, and pressing him warmly, without doubt would\nsoon have completed his work with a third blow, when the noise which\narose from the street being heard in the tennis court, two of the\nfriends of the Guardsman, who had seen him go out after exchanging some\nwords with d'Artagnan, rushed, sword in hand, from the court, and fell\nupon the conqueror. But Athos, Porthos, and Aramis quickly appeared\nin their turn, and the moment the two Guardsmen attacked their young\ncompanion, drove them back. Bernajoux now fell, and as the Guardsmen\nwere only two against four, they began to cry, \"To the rescue! The Hotel\nde la Tremouille!\" At these cries, all who were in the hotel rushed out\nand fell upon the four companions, who on their side cried aloud, \"To\nthe rescue, Musketeers!\"\n\nThis cry was generally heeded; for the Musketeers were known to be\nenemies of the cardinal, and were beloved on account of the hatred they\nbore to his Eminence. Thus the soldiers of other companies than those\nwhich belonged to the Red Duke, as Aramis had called him, often took\npart with the king's Musketeers in these quarrels. Of three Guardsmen\nof the company of M. Dessessart who were passing, two came to the\nassistance of the four companions, while the other ran toward the hotel\nof M. de Treville, crying, \"To the rescue, Musketeers! To the rescue!\"\nAs usual, this hotel was full of soldiers of this company, who hastened\nto the succor of their comrades. The MELEE became general, but strength\nwas on the side of the Musketeers. The cardinal's Guards and M. de la\nTremouille's people retreated into the hotel, the doors of which they\nclosed just in time to prevent their enemies from entering with them. As\nto the wounded man, he had been taken in at once, and, as we have said,\nin a very bad state.\n\nExcitement was at its height among the Musketeers and their allies, and\nthey even began to deliberate whether they should not set fire to the\nhotel to punish the insolence of M. de la Tremouille's domestics in\ndaring to make a SORTIE upon the king's Musketeers. The proposition had\nbeen made, and received with enthusiasm, when fortunately eleven o'clock\nstruck. D'Artagnan and his companions remembered their audience, and as\nthey would very much have regretted that such an opportunity should be\nlost, they succeeded in calming their friends, who contented themselves\nwith hurling some paving stones against the gates; but the gates were\ntoo strong. They soon tired of the sport. Besides, those who must be\nconsidered the leaders of the enterprise had quit the group and were\nmaking their way toward the hotel of M. de Treville, who was waiting for\nthem, already informed of this fresh disturbance.\n\n\"Quick to the Louvre,\" said he, \"to the Louvre without losing an\ninstant, and let us endeavor to see the king before he is prejudiced by\nthe cardinal. We will describe the thing to him as a consequence of the\naffair of yesterday, and the two will pass off together.\"\n\nM. de Treville, accompanied by the four young fellows, directed his\ncourse toward the Louvre; but to the great astonishment of the captain\nof the Musketeers, he was informed that the king had gone stag hunting\nin the forest of St. Germain. M. de Treville required this intelligence\nto be repeated to him twice, and each time his companions saw his brow\nbecome darker.\n\n\"Had his Majesty,\" asked he, \"any intention of holding this hunting\nparty yesterday?\"\n\n\"No, your Excellency,\" replied the valet de chambre, \"the Master of the\nHounds came this morning to inform him that he had marked down a stag.\nAt first the king answered that he would not go; but he could not resist\nhis love of sport, and set out after dinner.\"\n\n\"And the king has seen the cardinal?\" asked M. de Treville.\n\n\"In all probability he has,\" replied the valet, \"for I saw the horses\nharnessed to his Eminence's carriage this morning, and when I asked\nwhere he was going, they told me, 'To St. Germain.'\"\n\n\"He is beforehand with us,\" said M. de Treville. \"Gentlemen, I will see\nthe king this evening; but as to you, I do not advise you to risk doing\nso.\"\n\nThis advice was too reasonable, and moreover came from a man who knew\nthe king too well, to allow the four young men to dispute it. M. de\nTreville recommended everyone to return home and wait for news.\n\nOn entering his hotel, M. de Treville thought it best to be first in\nmaking the complaint. He sent one of his servants to M. de la Tremouille\nwith a letter in which he begged of him to eject the cardinal's\nGuardsmen from his house, and to reprimand his people for their\naudacity in making SORTIE against the king's Musketeers. But M. de la\nTremouille--already prejudiced by his esquire, whose relative, as we\nalready know, Bernajoux was--replied that it was neither for M. de\nTreville nor the Musketeers to complain, but, on the contrary, for\nhim, whose people the Musketeers had assaulted and whose hotel they had\nendeavored to burn. Now, as the debate between these two nobles might\nlast a long time, each becoming, naturally, more firm in his own\nopinion, M. de Treville thought of an expedient which might terminate it\nquietly. This was to go himself to M. de la Tremouille.\n\nHe repaired, therefore, immediately to his hotel, and caused himself to\nbe announced.\n\nThe two nobles saluted each other politely, for if no friendship existed\nbetween them, there was at least esteem. Both were men of courage and\nhonor; and as M. de la Tremouille--a Protestant, and seeing the king\nseldom--was of no party, he did not, in general, carry any bias into his\nsocial relations. This time, however, his address, although polite, was\ncooler than usual.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said M. de Treville, \"we fancy that we have each cause\nto complain of the other, and I am come to endeavor to clear up this\naffair.\"\n\n\"I have no objection,\" replied M. de la Tremouille, \"but I warn you that\nI am well informed, and all the fault is with your Musketeers.\"\n\n\"You are too just and reasonable a man, monsieur!\" said Treville, \"not\nto accept the proposal I am about to make to you.\"\n\n\"Make it, monsieur, I listen.\"\n\n\"How is Monsieur Bernajoux, your esquire's relative?\"\n\n\"Why, monsieur, very ill indeed! In addition to the sword thrust in his\narm, which is not dangerous, he has received another right through his\nlungs, of which the doctor says bad things.\"\n\n\"But has the wounded man retained his senses?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"Does he talk?\"\n\n\"With difficulty, but he can speak.\"\n\n\"Well, monsieur, let us go to him. Let us adjure him, in the name of the\nGod before whom he must perhaps appear, to speak the truth. I will take\nhim for judge in his own cause, monsieur, and will believe what he will\nsay.\"\n\nM. de la Tremouille reflected for an instant; then as it was difficult\nto suggest a more reasonable proposal, he agreed to it.\n\nBoth descended to the chamber in which the wounded man lay. The latter,\non seeing these two noble lords who came to visit him, endeavored to\nraise himself up in his bed; but he was too weak, and exhausted by the\neffort, he fell back again almost senseless.\n\nM. de la Tremouille approached him, and made him inhale some salts,\nwhich recalled him to life. Then M. de Treville, unwilling that it\nshould be thought that he had influenced the wounded man, requested M.\nde la Tremouille to interrogate him himself.\n\nThat happened which M. de Treville had foreseen. Placed between life and\ndeath, as Bernajoux was, he had no idea for a moment of concealing the\ntruth; and he described to the two nobles the affair exactly as it had\npassed.\n\nThis was all that M. de Treville wanted. He wished Bernajoux a speedy\nconvalescence, took leave of M. de la Tremouille, returned to his hotel,\nand immediately sent word to the four friends that he awaited their\ncompany at dinner.\n\nM. de Treville entertained good company, wholly anticardinalist, though.\nIt may easily be understood, therefore, that the conversation during the\nwhole of dinner turned upon the two checks that his Eminence's Guardsmen\nhad received. Now, as d'Artagnan had been the hero of these two fights,\nit was upon him that all the felicitations fell, which Athos, Porthos,\nand Aramis abandoned to him, not only as good comrades, but as men who\nhad so often had their turn that could very well afford him his.\n\nToward six o'clock M. de Treville announced that it was time to go to\nthe Louvre; but as the hour of audience granted by his Majesty was past,\ninstead of claiming the ENTREE by the back stairs, he placed himself\nwith the four young men in the antechamber. The king had not yet\nreturned from hunting. Our young men had been waiting about half an\nhour, amid a crowd of courtiers, when all the doors were thrown open,\nand his Majesty was announced.\n\nAt his announcement d'Artagnan felt himself tremble to the very marrow\nof his bones. The coming instant would in all probability decide the\nrest of his life. His eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon\nthe door through which the king must enter.\n\nLouis XIII appeared, walking fast. He was in hunting costume covered\nwith dust, wearing large boots, and holding a whip in his hand. At the\nfirst glance, d'Artagnan judged that the mind of the king was stormy.\n\nThis disposition, visible as it was in his Majesty, did not prevent\nthe courtiers from ranging themselves along his pathway. In royal\nantechambers it is worth more to be viewed with an angry eye than not to\nbe seen at all. The three Musketeers therefore did not hesitate to make\na step forward. D'Artagnan on the contrary remained concealed behind\nthem; but although the king knew Athos, Porthos, and Aramis personally,\nhe passed before them without speaking or looking--indeed, as if he had\nnever seen them before. As for M. de Treville, when the eyes of the king\nfell upon him, he sustained the look with so much firmness that it\nwas the king who dropped his eyes; after which his Majesty, grumbling,\nentered his apartment.\n\n\"Matters go but badly,\" said Athos, smiling; \"and we shall not be made\nChevaliers of the Order this time.\"\n\n\"Wait here ten minutes,\" said M. de Treville; \"and if at the expiration\nof ten minutes you do not see me come out, return to my hotel, for it\nwill be useless for you to wait for me longer.\"\n\nThe four young men waited ten minutes, a quarter of an hour, twenty\nminutes; and seeing that M. de Treville did not return, went away very\nuneasy as to what was going to happen.\n\nM. de Treville entered the king's cabinet boldly, and found his Majesty\nin a very ill humor, seated on an armchair, beating his boot with the\nhandle of his whip. This, however, did not prevent his asking, with the\ngreatest coolness, after his Majesty's health.\n\n\"Bad, monsieur, bad!\" replied the king; \"I am bored.\"\n\nThis was, in fact, the worst complaint of Louis XIII, who would\nsometimes take one of his courtiers to a window and say, \"Monsieur\nSo-and-so, let us weary ourselves together.\"\n\n\"How! Your Majesty is bored? Have you not enjoyed the pleasures of the\nchase today?\"\n\n\"A fine pleasure, indeed, monsieur! Upon my soul, everything\ndegenerates; and I don't know whether it is the game which leaves\nno scent, or the dogs that have no noses. We started a stag of ten\nbranches. We chased him for six hours, and when he was near being\ntaken--when St.-Simon was already putting his horn to his mouth to sound\nthe mort--crack, all the pack takes the wrong scent and sets off after\na two-year-older. I shall be obliged to give up hunting, as I have given\nup hawking. Ah, I am an unfortunate king, Monsieur de Treville! I had\nbut one gerfalcon, and he died day before yesterday.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sire, I wholly comprehend your disappointment. The misfortune\nis great; but I think you have still a good number of falcons, sparrow\nhawks, and tiercets.\"\n\n\"And not a man to instruct them. Falconers are declining. I know no one\nbut myself who is acquainted with the noble art of venery. After me it\nwill all be over, and people will hunt with gins, snares, and traps. If\nI had but the time to train pupils! But there is the cardinal always\nat hand, who does not leave me a moment's repose; who talks to me about\nSpain, who talks to me about Austria, who talks to me about England! Ah!\nA PROPOS of the cardinal, Monsieur de Treville, I am vexed with you!\"\n\nThis was the chance at which M. de Treville waited for the king. He\nknew the king of old, and he knew that all these complaints were but a\npreface--a sort of excitation to encourage himself--and that he had now\ncome to his point at last.\n\n\"And in what have I been so unfortunate as to displease your Majesty?\"\nasked M. de Treville, feigning the most profound astonishment.\n\n\"Is it thus you perform your charge, monsieur?\" continued the king,\nwithout directly replying to de Treville's question. \"Is it for this I\nname you captain of my Musketeers, that they should assassinate a man,\ndisturb a whole quarter, and endeavor to set fire to Paris, without\nyour saying a word? But yet,\" continued the king, \"undoubtedly my haste\naccuses you wrongfully; without doubt the rioters are in prison, and you\ncome to tell me justice is done.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" replied M. de Treville, calmly, \"on the contrary, I come to\ndemand it of you.\"\n\n\"And against whom?\" cried the king.\n\n\"Against calumniators,\" said M. de Treville.\n\n\"Ah! This is something new,\" replied the king. \"Will you tell me that\nyour three damned Musketeers, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, and your\nyoungster from Bearn, have not fallen, like so many furies, upon poor\nBernajoux, and have not maltreated him in such a fashion that probably\nby this time he is dead? Will you tell me that they did not lay siege to\nthe hotel of the Duc de la Tremouille, and that they did not endeavor to\nburn it?--which would not, perhaps, have been a great misfortune in time\nof war, seeing that it is nothing but a nest of Huguenots, but which is,\nin time of peace, a frightful example. Tell me, now, can you deny all\nthis?\"\n\n\"And who told you this fine story, sire?\" asked Treville, quietly.\n\n\"Who has told me this fine story, monsieur? Who should it be but he who\nwatches while I sleep, who labors while I amuse myself, who conducts\neverything at home and abroad--in France as in Europe?\"\n\n\"Your Majesty probably refers to God,\" said M. de Treville; \"for I know\nno one except God who can be so far above your Majesty.\"\n\n\"No, monsieur; I speak of the prop of the state, of my only servant, of\nmy only friend--of the cardinal.\"\n\n\"His Eminence is not his holiness, sire.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that, monsieur?\"\n\n\"That it is only the Pope who is infallible, and that this infallibility\ndoes not extend to cardinals.\"\n\n\"You mean to say that he deceives me; you mean to say that he betrays\nme? You accuse him, then? Come, speak; avow freely that you accuse him!\"\n\n\"No, sire, but I say that he deceives himself. I say that he is\nill-informed. I say that he has hastily accused your Majesty's\nMusketeers, toward whom he is unjust, and that he has not obtained his\ninformation from good sources.\"\n\n\"The accusation comes from Monsieur de la Tremouille, from the duke\nhimself. What do you say to that?\"\n\n\"I might answer, sire, that he is too deeply interested in the question\nto be a very impartial witness; but so far from that, sire, I know the\nduke to be a royal gentleman, and I refer the matter to him--but upon\none condition, sire.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"It is that your Majesty will make him come here, will interrogate him\nyourself, TETE-A-TETE, without witnesses, and that I shall see your\nMajesty as soon as you have seen the duke.\"\n\n\"What, then! You will bind yourself,\" cried the king, \"by what Monsieur\nde la Tremouille shall say?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"You will accept his judgment?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly.\"\n\n\"Any you will submit to the reparation he may require?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"La Chesnaye,\" said the king. \"La Chesnaye!\"\n\nLouis XIII's confidential valet, who never left the door, entered in\nreply to the call.\n\n\"La Chesnaye,\" said the king, \"let someone go instantly and find\nMonsieur de la Tremouille; I wish to speak with him this evening.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty gives me your word that you will not see anyone between\nMonsieur de la Tremouille and myself?\"\n\n\"Nobody, by the faith of a gentleman.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow, then, sire?\"\n\n\"Tomorrow, monsieur.\"\n\n\"At what o'clock, please your Majesty?\"\n\n\"At any hour you will.\"\n\n\"But in coming too early I should be afraid of awakening your Majesty.\"\n\n\"Awaken me! Do you think I ever sleep, then? I sleep no longer,\nmonsieur. I sometimes dream, that's all. Come, then, as early as you\nlike--at seven o'clock; but beware, if you and your Musketeers are\nguilty.\"\n\n\"If my Musketeers are guilty, sire, the guilty shall be placed in your\nMajesty's hands, who will dispose of them at your good pleasure. Does\nyour Majesty require anything further? Speak, I am ready to obey.\"\n\n\"No, monsieur, no; I am not called Louis the Just without reason.\nTomorrow, then, monsieur--tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Till then, God preserve your Majesty!\"\n\nHowever ill the king might sleep, M. de Treville slept still worse. He\nhad ordered his three Musketeers and their companion to be with him at\nhalf past six in the morning. He took them with him, without encouraging\nthem or promising them anything, and without concealing from them that\ntheir luck, and even his own, depended upon the cast of the dice.\n\nArrived at the foot of the back stairs, he desired them to wait. If the\nking was still irritated against them, they would depart without being\nseen; if the king consented to see them, they would only have to be\ncalled.\n\nOn arriving at the king's private antechamber, M. de Treville found La\nChesnaye, who informed him that they had not been able to find M. de la\nTremouille on the preceding evening at his hotel, that he returned too\nlate to present himself at the Louvre, that he had only that moment\narrived and that he was at that very hour with the king.\n\nThis circumstance pleased M. de Treville much, as he thus became certain\nthat no foreign suggestion could insinuate itself between M. de la\nTremouille's testimony and himself.\n\nIn fact, ten minutes had scarcely passed away when the door of the\nking's closet opened, and M. de Treville saw M. de la Tremouille come\nout. The duke came straight up to him, and said: \"Monsieur de Treville,\nhis Majesty has just sent for me in order to inquire respecting the\ncircumstances which took place yesterday at my hotel. I have told him\nthe truth; that is to say, that the fault lay with my people, and that I\nwas ready to offer you my excuses. Since I have the good fortune to meet\nyou, I beg you to receive them, and to hold me always as one of your\nfriends.\"\n\n\"Monsieur the Duke,\" said M. de Treville, \"I was so confident of your\nloyalty that I required no other defender before his Majesty than\nyourself. I find that I have not been mistaken, and I thank you\nthat there is still one man in France of whom may be said, without\ndisappointment, what I have said of you.\"\n\n\"That's well said,\" cried the king, who had heard all these compliments\nthrough the open door; \"only tell him, Treville, since he wishes to\nbe considered your friend, that I also wish to be one of his, but he\nneglects me; that it is nearly three years since I have seen him, and\nthat I never do see him unless I send for him. Tell him all this for me,\nfor these are things which a king cannot say for himself.\"\n\n\"Thanks, sire, thanks,\" said the duke; \"but your Majesty may be assured\nthat it is not those--I do not speak of Monsieur de Treville--whom your\nMajesty sees at all hours of the day that are most devoted to you.\"\n\n\"Ah! You have heard what I said? So much the better, Duke, so much\nthe better,\" said the king, advancing toward the door. \"Ah! It is you,\nTreville. Where are your Musketeers? I told you the day before yesterday\nto bring them with you; why have you not done so?\"\n\n\"They are below, sire, and with your permission La Chesnaye will bid\nthem come up.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, let them come up immediately. It is nearly eight o'clock, and\nat nine I expect a visit. Go, Monsieur Duke, and return often. Come in,\nTreville.\"\n\nThe Duke saluted and retired. At the moment he opened the door, the\nthree Musketeers and d'Artagnan, conducted by La Chesnaye, appeared at\nthe top of the staircase.\n\n\"Come in, my braves,\" said the king, \"come in; I am going to scold you.\"\n\nThe Musketeers advanced, bowing, d'Artagnan following closely behind\nthem.\n\n\"What the devil!\" continued the king. \"Seven of his Eminence's Guards\nplaced HORS DE COMBAT by you four in two days! That's too many,\ngentlemen, too many! If you go on so, his Eminence will be forced to\nrenew his company in three weeks, and I to put the edicts in force in\nall their rigor. One now and then I don't say much about; but seven in\ntwo days, I repeat, it is too many, it is far too many!\"\n\n\"Therefore, sire, your Majesty sees that they are come, quite contrite\nand repentant, to offer you their excuses.\"\n\n\"Quite contrite and repentant! Hem!\" said the king. \"I place no\nconfidence in their hypocritical faces. In particular, there is one\nyonder of a Gascon look. Come hither, monsieur.\"\n\nD'Artagnan, who understood that it was to him this compliment was\naddressed, approached, assuming a most deprecating air.\n\n\"Why you told me he was a young man? This is a boy, Treville, a mere\nboy! Do you mean to say that it was he who bestowed that severe thrust\nat Jussac?\"\n\n\"And those two equally fine thrusts at Bernajoux.\"\n\n\"Truly!\"\n\n\"Without reckoning,\" said Athos, \"that if he had not rescued me from\nthe hands of Cahusac, I should not now have the honor of making my very\nhumble reverence to your Majesty.\"\n\n\"Why he is a very devil, this Bearnais! VENTRE-SAINT-GRIS, Monsieur de\nTreville, as the king my father would have said. But at this sort of\nwork, many doublets must be slashed and many swords broken. Now, Gascons\nare always poor, are they not?\"\n\n\"Sire, I can assert that they have hitherto discovered no gold mines in\ntheir mountains; though the Lord owes them this miracle in recompense\nfor the manner in which they supported the pretensions of the king your\nfather.\"\n\n\"Which is to say that the Gascons made a king of me, myself, seeing that\nI am my father's son, is it not, Treville? Well, happily, I don't say\nnay to it. La Chesnaye, go and see if by rummaging all my pockets you\ncan find forty pistoles; and if you can find them, bring them to me. And\nnow let us see, young man, with your hand upon your conscience, how did\nall this come to pass?\"\n\nD'Artagnan related the adventure of the preceding day in all its\ndetails; how, not having been able to sleep for the joy he felt in the\nexpectation of seeing his Majesty, he had gone to his three friends\nthree hours before the hour of audience; how they had gone together\nto the tennis court, and how, upon the fear he had manifested lest he\nreceive a ball in the face, he had been jeered at by Bernajoux who had\nnearly paid for his jeer with his life and M. de la Tremouille, who had\nnothing to do with the matter, with the loss of his hotel.\n\n\"This is all very well,\" murmured the king, \"yes, this is just the\naccount the duke gave me of the affair. Poor cardinal! Seven men in two\ndays, and those of his very best! But that's quite enough, gentlemen;\nplease to understand, that's enough. You have taken your revenge for the\nRue Ferou, and even exceeded it; you ought to be satisfied.\"\n\n\"If your Majesty is so,\" said Treville, \"we are.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I am,\" added the king, taking a handful of gold from La\nChesnaye, and putting it into the hand of d'Artagnan. \"Here,\" said he,\n\"is a proof of my satisfaction.\"\n\nAt this epoch, the ideas of pride which are in fashion in our days did\nnot prevail. A gentleman received, from hand to hand, money from the\nking, and was not the least in the world humiliated. D'Artagnan put his\nforty pistoles into his pocket without any scruple--on the contrary,\nthanking his Majesty greatly.\n\n\"There,\" said the king, looking at a clock, \"there, now, as it is half\npast eight, you may retire; for as I told you, I expect someone at nine.\nThanks for your devotedness, gentlemen. I may continue to rely upon it,\nmay I not?\"\n\n\"Oh, sire!\" cried the four companions, with one voice, \"we would allow\nourselves to be cut to pieces in your Majesty's service.\"\n\n\"Well, well, but keep whole; that will be better, and you will be more\nuseful to me. Treville,\" added the king, in a low voice, as the others\nwere retiring, \"as you have no room in the Musketeers, and as we have\nbesides decided that a novitiate is necessary before entering that\ncorps, place this young man in the company of the Guards of Monsieur\nDessessart, your brother-in-law. Ah, PARDIEU, Treville! I enjoy\nbeforehand the face the cardinal will make. He will be furious; but I\ndon't care. I am doing what is right.\"\n\nThe king waved his hand to Treville, who left him and rejoined the\nMusketeers, whom he found sharing the forty pistoles with d'Artagnan.\n\nThe cardinal, as his Majesty had said, was really furious, so furious\nthat during eight days he absented himself from the king's gaming\ntable. This did not prevent the king from being as complacent to him as\npossible whenever he met him, or from asking in the kindest tone, \"Well,\nMonsieur Cardinal, how fares it with that poor Jussac and that poor\nBernajoux of yours?\"\n\n\n\n\n7 THE INTERIOR OF \"THE MUSKETEERS\"\n\nWhen d'Artagnan was out of the Louvre, and consulted his friends upon\nthe use he had best make of his share of the forty pistoles, Athos\nadvised him to order a good repast at the Pomme-de-Pin, Porthos to\nengage a lackey, and Aramis to provide himself with a suitable mistress.\n\nThe repast was carried into effect that very day, and the lackey waited\nat table. The repast had been ordered by Athos, and the lackey furnished\nby Porthos. He was a Picard, whom the glorious Musketeer had picked up\non the Bridge Tournelle, making rings and plashing in the water.\n\nPorthos pretended that this occupation was proof of a reflective and\ncontemplative organization, and he had brought him away without any\nother recommendation. The noble carriage of this gentleman, for whom he\nbelieved himself to be engaged, had won Planchet--that was the name of\nthe Picard. He felt a slight disappointment, however, when he saw that\nthis place was already taken by a compeer named Mousqueton, and when\nPorthos signified to him that the state of his household, though great,\nwould not support two servants, and that he must enter into the service\nof d'Artagnan. Nevertheless, when he waited at the dinner given by\nhis master, and saw him take out a handful of gold to pay for it, he\nbelieved his fortune made, and returned thanks to heaven for having\nthrown him into the service of such a Croesus. He preserved this opinion\neven after the feast, with the remnants of which he repaired his own\nlong abstinence; but when in the evening he made his master's bed,\nthe chimeras of Planchet faded away. The bed was the only one in the\napartment, which consisted of an antechamber and a bedroom. Planchet\nslept in the antechamber upon a coverlet taken from the bed of\nd'Artagnan, and which d'Artagnan from that time made shift to do\nwithout.\n\nAthos, on his part, had a valet whom he had trained in his service in\na thoroughly peculiar fashion, and who was named Grimaud. He was very\ntaciturn, this worthy signor. Be it understood we are speaking of Athos.\nDuring the five or six years that he had lived in the strictest intimacy\nwith his companions, Porthos and Aramis, they could remember having\noften seen him smile, but had never heard him laugh. His words were\nbrief and expressive, conveying all that was meant, and no more; no\nembellishments, no embroidery, no arabesques. His conversation a matter\nof fact, without a single romance.\n\nAlthough Athos was scarcely thirty years old, and was of great personal\nbeauty and intelligence of mind, no one knew whether he had ever had a\nmistress. He never spoke of women. He certainly did not prevent others\nfrom speaking of them before him, although it was easy to perceive that\nthis kind of conversation, in which he only mingled by bitter words and\nmisanthropic remarks, was very disagreeable to him. His reserve, his\nroughness, and his silence made almost an old man of him. He had, then,\nin order not to disturb his habits, accustomed Grimaud to obey him upon\na simple gesture or upon a simple movement of his lips. He never spoke\nto him, except under the most extraordinary occasions.\n\nSometimes, Grimaud, who feared his master as he did fire, while\nentertaining a strong attachment to his person and a great veneration\nfor his talents, believed he perfectly understood what he wanted, flew\nto execute the order received, and did precisely the contrary. Athos\nthen shrugged his shoulders, and, without putting himself in a passion,\nthrashed Grimaud. On these days he spoke a little.\n\nPorthos, as we have seen, had a character exactly opposite to that of\nAthos. He not only talked much, but he talked loudly, little caring, we\nmust render him that justice, whether anybody listened to him or not.\nHe talked for the pleasure of talking and for the pleasure of hearing\nhimself talk. He spoke upon all subjects except the sciences, alleging\nin this respect the inveterate hatred he had borne to scholars from his\nchildhood. He had not so noble an air as Athos, and the commencement of\ntheir intimacy often rendered him unjust toward that gentleman, whom\nhe endeavored to eclipse by his splendid dress. But with his simple\nMusketeer's uniform and nothing but the manner in which he threw back\nhis head and advanced his foot, Athos instantly took the place which\nwas his due and consigned the ostentatious Porthos to the second rank.\nPorthos consoled himself by filling the antechamber of M. de Treville\nand the guardroom of the Louvre with the accounts of his love scrapes,\nafter having passed from professional ladies to military ladies, from\nthe lawyer's dame to the baroness, there was question of nothing less\nwith Porthos than a foreign princess, who was enormously fond of him.\n\nAn old proverb says, \"Like master, like man.\" Let us pass, then, from\nthe valet of Athos to the valet of Porthos, from Grimaud to Mousqueton.\n\nMousqueton was a Norman, whose pacific name of Boniface his master had\nchanged into the infinitely more sonorous name of Mousqueton. He had\nentered the service of Porthos upon condition that he should only be\nclothed and lodged, though in a handsome manner; but he claimed two\nhours a day to himself, consecrated to an employment which would provide\nfor his other wants. Porthos agreed to the bargain; the thing suited\nhim wonderfully well. He had doublets cut out of his old clothes and\ncast-off cloaks for Mousqueton, and thanks to a very intelligent tailor,\nwho made his clothes look as good as new by turning them, and whose wife\nwas suspected of wishing to make Porthos descend from his aristocratic\nhabits, Mousqueton made a very good figure when attending on his master.\n\nAs for Aramis, of whom we believe we have sufficiently explained the\ncharacter--a character which, like that of his lackey was called Bazin.\nThanks to the hopes which his master entertained of someday entering\ninto orders, he was always clothed in black, as became the servant of\na churchman. He was a Berrichon, thirty-five or forty years old, mild,\npeaceable, sleek, employing the leisure his master left him in the\nperusal of pious works, providing rigorously for two a dinner of few\ndishes, but excellent. For the rest, he was dumb, blind, and deaf, and\nof unimpeachable fidelity.\n\nAnd now that we are acquainted, superficially at least, with the masters\nand the valets, let us pass on to the dwellings occupied by each of\nthem.\n\nAthos dwelt in the Rue Ferou, within two steps of the Luxembourg. His\napartment consisted of two small chambers, very nicely fitted up, in\na furnished house, the hostess of which, still young and still really\nhandsome, cast tender glances uselessly at him. Some fragments of past\nsplendor appeared here and there upon the walls of this modest lodging;\na sword, for example, richly embossed, which belonged by its make to\nthe times of Francis I, the hilt of which alone, encrusted with precious\nstones, might be worth two hundred pistoles, and which, nevertheless, in\nhis moments of greatest distress Athos had never pledged or offered for\nsale. It had long been an object of ambition for Porthos. Porthos would\nhave given ten years of his life to possess this sword.\n\nOne day, when he had an appointment with a duchess, he endeavored even\nto borrow it of Athos. Athos, without saying anything, emptied his\npockets, got together all his jewels, purses, aiguillettes, and gold\nchains, and offered them all to Porthos; but as to the sword, he said it\nwas sealed to its place and should never quit it until its master\nshould himself quit his lodgings. In addition to the sword, there was a\nportrait representing a nobleman of the time of Henry III, dressed with\nthe greatest elegance, and who wore the Order of the Holy Ghost; and\nthis portrait had certain resemblances of lines with Athos, certain\nfamily likenesses which indicated that this great noble, a knight of the\nOrder of the King, was his ancestor.\n\nBesides these, a casket of magnificent goldwork, with the same arms as\nthe sword and the portrait, formed a middle ornament to the mantelpiece,\nand assorted badly with the rest of the furniture. Athos always carried\nthe key of this coffer about him; but he one day opened it before\nPorthos, and Porthos was convinced that this coffer contained nothing\nbut letters and papers--love letters and family papers, no doubt.\n\nPorthos lived in an apartment, large in size and of very sumptuous\nappearance, in the Rue du Vieux-Colombier. Every time he passed with\na friend before his windows, at one of which Mousqueton was sure to be\nplaced in full livery, Porthos raised his head and his hand, and said,\n\"That is my abode!\" But he was never to be found at home; he never\ninvited anybody to go up with him, and no one could form an idea of what\nhis sumptuous apartment contained in the shape of real riches.\n\nAs to Aramis, he dwelt in a little lodging composed of a boudoir, an\neating room, and a bedroom, which room, situated, as the others were, on\nthe ground floor, looked out upon a little fresh green garden, shady and\nimpenetrable to the eyes of his neighbors.\n\nWith regard to d'Artagnan, we know how he was lodged, and we have\nalready made acquaintance with his lackey, Master Planchet.\n\nD'Artagnan, who was by nature very curious--as people generally are who\npossess the genius of intrigue--did all he could to make out who Athos,\nPorthos, and Aramis really were (for under these pseudonyms each of\nthese young men concealed his family name)--Athos in particular, who, a\nleague away, savored of nobility. He addressed himself then to Porthos\nto gain information respecting Athos and Aramis, and to Aramis in order\nto learn something of Porthos.\n\nUnfortunately Porthos knew nothing of the life of his silent companion\nbut what revealed itself. It was said Athos had met with great crosses\nin love, and that a frightful treachery had forever poisoned the life\nof this gallant man. What could this treachery be? All the world was\nignorant of it.\n\nAs to Porthos, except his real name (as was the case with those of his\ntwo comrades), his life was very easily known. Vain and indiscreet, it\nwas as easy to see through him as through a crystal. The only thing to\nmislead the investigator would have been belief in all the good things\nhe said of himself.\n\nWith respect to Aramis, though having the air of having nothing secret\nabout him, he was a young fellow made up of mysteries, answering little\nto questions put to him about others, and having learned from him the\nreport which prevailed concerning the success of the Musketeer with a\nprincess, wished to gain a little insight into the amorous adventures of\nhis interlocutor. \"And you, my dear companion,\" said he, \"you speak of\nthe baronesses, countesses, and princesses of others?\"\n\n\"PARDIEU! I spoke of them because Porthos talked of them himself,\nbecause he had paraded all these fine things before me. But be assured,\nmy dear Monsieur d'Artagnan, that if I had obtained them from any other\nsource, or if they had been confided to me, there exists no confessor\nmore discreet than myself.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't doubt that,\" replied d'Artagnan; \"but it seems to me that\nyou are tolerably familiar with coats of arms--a certain embroidered\nhandkerchief, for instance, to which I owe the honor of your\nacquaintance?\"\n\nThis time Aramis was not angry, but assumed the most modest air and\nreplied in a friendly tone, \"My dear friend, do not forget that I wish\nto belong to the Church, and that I avoid all mundane opportunities. The\nhandkerchief you saw had not been given to me, but it had been forgotten\nand left at my house by one of my friends. I was obliged to pick it up\nin order not to compromise him and the lady he loves. As for myself, I\nneither have, nor desire to have, a mistress, following in that respect\nthe very judicious example of Athos, who has none any more than I have.\"\n\n\"But what the devil! You are not a priest, you are a Musketeer!\"\n\n\"A Musketeer for a time, my friend, as the cardinal says, a Musketeer\nagainst my will, but a churchman at heart, believe me. Athos and\nPorthos dragged me into this to occupy me. I had, at the moment of being\nordained, a little difficulty with--But that would not interest you, and\nI am taking up your valuable time.\"\n\n\"Not at all; it interests me very much,\" cried d'Artagnan; \"and at this\nmoment I have absolutely nothing to do.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I have my breviary to repeat,\" answered Aramis; \"then some\nverses to compose, which Madame d'Aiguillon begged of me. Then I must\ngo to the Rue St. Honore in order to purchase some rouge for Madame de\nChevreuse. So you see, my dear friend, that if you are not in a hurry, I\nam very much in a hurry.\"\n\nAramis held out his hand in a cordial manner to his young companion, and\ntook leave of him.\n\nNotwithstanding all the pains he took, d'Artagnan was unable to learn\nany more concerning his three new-made friends. He formed, therefore,\nthe resolution of believing for the present all that was said of their\npast, hoping for more certain and extended revelations in the future. In\nthe meanwhile, he looked upon Athos as an Achilles, Porthos as an Ajax,\nand Aramis as a Joseph.\n\nAs to the rest, the life of the four young friends was joyous enough.\nAthos played, and that as a rule unfortunately. Nevertheless, he never\nborrowed a sou of his companions, although his purse was ever at their\nservice; and when he had played upon honor, he always awakened his\ncreditor by six o'clock the next morning to pay the debt of the\npreceding evening.\n\nPorthos had his fits. On the days when he won he was insolent and\nostentatious; if he lost, he disappeared completely for several days,\nafter which he reappeared with a pale face and thinner person, but with\nmoney in his purse.\n\nAs to Aramis, he never played. He was the worst Musketeer and the most\nunconvivial companion imaginable. He had always something or other\nto do. Sometimes in the midst of dinner, when everyone, under the\nattraction of wine and in the warmth of conversation, believed they had\ntwo or three hours longer to enjoy themselves at table, Aramis looked at\nhis watch, arose with a bland smile, and took leave of the company, to\ngo, as he said, to consult a casuist with whom he had an appointment. At\nother times he would return home to write a treatise, and requested his\nfriends not to disturb him.\n\nAt this Athos would smile, with his charming, melancholy smile, which\nso became his noble countenance, and Porthos would drink, swearing that\nAramis would never be anything but a village CURE.\n\nPlanchet, d'Artagnan's valet, supported his good fortune nobly. He\nreceived thirty sous per day, and for a month he returned to his\nlodgings gay as a chaffinch, and affable toward his master. When the\nwind of adversity began to blow upon the housekeeping of the Rue des\nFossoyeurs--that is to say, when the forty pistoles of King Louis XIII\nwere consumed or nearly so--he commenced complaints which Athos thought\nnauseous, Porthos indecent, and Aramis ridiculous. Athos counseled\nd'Artagnan to dismiss the fellow; Porthos was of opinion that he should\ngive him a good thrashing first; and Aramis contended that a master\nshould never attend to anything but the civilities paid to him.\n\n\"This is all very easy for you to say,\" replied d'Artagnan, \"for you,\nAthos, who live like a dumb man with Grimaud, who forbid him to speak,\nand consequently never exchange ill words with him; for you, Porthos,\nwho carry matters in such a magnificent style, and are a god to your\nvalet, Mousqueton; and for you, Aramis, who, always abstracted by your\ntheological studies, inspire your servant, Bazin, a mild, religious man,\nwith a profound respect; but for me, who am without any settled means\nand without resources--for me, who am neither a Musketeer nor even a\nGuardsman, what I am to do to inspire either the affection, the terror,\nor the respect in Planchet?\"\n\n\"This is serious,\" answered the three friends; \"it is a family affair.\nIt is with valets as with wives, they must be placed at once upon the\nfooting in which you wish them to remain. Reflect upon it.\"\n\nD'Artagnan did reflect, and resolved to thrash Planchet provisionally;\nwhich he did with the conscientiousness that d'Artagnan carried into\neverything. After having well beaten him, he forbade him to leave his\nservice without his permission. \"For,\" added he, \"the future cannot fail\nto mend; I inevitably look for better times. Your fortune is therefore\nmade if you remain with me, and I am too good a master to allow you to\nmiss such a chance by granting you the dismissal you require.\"\n\nThis manner of acting roused much respect for d'Artagnan's policy among\nthe Musketeers. Planchet was equally seized with admiration, and said no\nmore about going away.\n\nThe life of the four young men had become fraternal. D'Artagnan, who\nhad no settled habits of his own, as he came from his province into the\nmidst of his world quite new to him, fell easily into the habits of his\nfriends.\n\nThey rose about eight o'clock in the winter, about six in summer,\nand went to take the countersign and see how things went on at M. de\nTreville's. D'Artagnan, although he was not a Musketeer, performed the\nduty of one with remarkable punctuality. He went on guard because he\nalways kept company with whoever of his friends was on duty. He was well\nknown at the Hotel of the Musketeers, where everyone considered him\na good comrade. M. de Treville, who had appreciated him at the first\nglance and who bore him a real affection, never ceased recommending him\nto the king.\n\nOn their side, the three Musketeers were much attached to their young\ncomrade. The friendship which united these four men, and the need they\nfelt of seeing another three or four times a day, whether for dueling,\nbusiness, or pleasure, caused them to be continually running after one\nanother like shadows; and the Inseparables were constantly to be met\nwith seeking one another, from the Luxembourg to the Place St. Sulpice,\nor from the Rue du Vieux-Colombier to the Luxembourg.\n\nIn the meanwhile the promises of M. de Treville went on prosperously.\nOne fine morning the king commanded M. de Chevalier Dessessart to admit\nd'Artagnan as a cadet in his company of Guards. D'Artagnan, with a\nsigh, donned his uniform, which he would have exchanged for that of\na Musketeer at the expense of ten years of his existence. But M. de\nTreville promised this favor after a novitiate of two years--a novitiate\nwhich might besides be abridged if an opportunity should present itself\nfor d'Artagnan to render the king any signal service, or to distinguish\nhimself by some brilliant action. Upon this promise d'Artagnan withdrew,\nand the next day he began service.\n\nThen it became the turn of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis to mount guard\nwith d'Artagnan when he was on duty. The company of M. le Chevalier\nDessessart thus received four instead of one when it admitted\nd'Artagnan.\n\n\n\n\n8 CONCERNING A COURT INTRIGUE\n\nIn the meantime, the forty pistoles of King Louis XIII, like all other\nthings of this world, after having had a beginning had an end, and after\nthis end our four companions began to be somewhat embarrassed. At first,\nAthos supported the association for a time with his own means.\n\nPorthos succeeded him; and thanks to one of those disappearances to\nwhich he was accustomed, he was able to provide for the wants of all for\na fortnight. At last it became Aramis's turn, who performed it with a\ngood grace and who succeeded--as he said, by selling some theological\nbooks--in procuring a few pistoles.\n\nThen, as they had been accustomed to do, they had recourse to M. de\nTreville, who made some advances on their pay; but these advances could\nnot go far with three Musketeers who were already much in arrears and a\nGuardsman who as yet had no pay at all.\n\nAt length when they found they were likely to be really in want, they\ngot together, as a last effort, eight or ten pistoles, with which\nPorthos went to the gaming table. Unfortunately he was in a bad vein; he\nlost all, together with twenty-five pistoles for which he had given his\nword.\n\nThen the inconvenience became distress. The hungry friends, followed by\ntheir lackeys, were seen haunting the quays and Guard rooms, picking\nup among their friends abroad all the dinners they could meet with; for\naccording to the advice of Aramis, it was prudent to sow repasts right\nand left in prosperity, in order to reap a few in time of need.\n\nAthos was invited four times, and each time took his friends and their\nlackeys with him. Porthos had six occasions, and contrived in the same\nmanner that his friends should partake of them; Aramis had eight of\nthem. He was a man, as must have been already perceived, who made but\nlittle noise, and yet was much sought after.\n\nAs to d'Artagnan, who as yet knew nobody in the capital, he only found\none chocolate breakfast at the house of a priest of his own province,\nand one dinner at the house of a cornet of the Guards. He took his army\nto the priest's, where they devoured as much provision as would have\nlasted him for two months, and to the cornet's, who performed wonders;\nbut as Planchet said, \"People do not eat at once for all time, even when\nthey eat a good deal.\"\n\nD'Artagnan thus felt himself humiliated in having only procured one meal\nand a half for his companions--as the breakfast at the priest's could\nonly be counted as half a repast--in return for the feasts which Athos,\nPorthos, and Aramis had procured him. He fancied himself a burden to the\nsociety, forgetting in his perfectly juvenile good faith that he had\nfed this society for a month; and he set his mind actively to work. He\nreflected that this coalition of four young, brave, enterprising,\nand active men ought to have some other object than swaggering walks,\nfencing lessons, and practical jokes, more or less witty.\n\nIn fact, four men such as they were--four men devoted to one another,\nfrom their purses to their lives; four men always supporting one\nanother, never yielding, executing singly or together the resolutions\nformed in common; four arms threatening the four cardinal points, or\nturning toward a single point--must inevitably, either subterraneously,\nin open day, by mining, in the trench, by cunning, or by force, open\nthemselves a way toward the object they wished to attain, however well\nit might be defended, or however distant it may seem. The only thing\nthat astonished d'Artagnan was that his friends had never thought of\nthis.\n\nHe was thinking by himself, and even seriously racking his brain to find\na direction for this single force four times multiplied, with which\nhe did not doubt, as with the lever for which Archimedes sought, they\nshould succeed in moving the world, when someone tapped gently at his\ndoor. D'Artagnan awakened Planchet and ordered him to open it.\n\nFrom this phrase, \"d'Artagnan awakened Planchet,\" the reader must not\nsuppose it was night, or that day was hardly come. No, it had just\nstruck four. Planchet, two hours before, had asked his master for\nsome dinner, and he had answered him with the proverb, \"He who sleeps,\ndines.\" And Planchet dined by sleeping.\n\nA man was introduced of simple mien, who had the appearance of a\ntradesman. Planchet, by way of dessert, would have liked to hear the\nconversation; but the citizen declared to d'Artagnan that what he had to\nsay being important and confidential, he desired to be left alone with\nhim.\n\nD'Artagnan dismissed Planchet, and requested his visitor to be seated.\nThere was a moment of silence, during which the two men looked at each\nother, as if to make a preliminary acquaintance, after which d'Artagnan\nbowed, as a sign that he listened.\n\n\"I have heard Monsieur d'Artagnan spoken of as a very brave young\nman,\" said the citizen; \"and this reputation which he justly enjoys had\ndecided me to confide a secret to him.\"\n\n\"Speak, monsieur, speak,\" said d'Artagnan, who instinctively scented\nsomething advantageous.\n\nThe citizen made a fresh pause and continued, \"I have a wife who is\nseamstress to the queen, monsieur, and who is not deficient in either\nvirtue or beauty. I was induced to marry her about three years ago,\nalthough she had but very little dowry, because Monsieur Laporte, the\nqueen's cloak bearer, is her godfather, and befriends her.\"\n\n\"Well, monsieur?\" asked d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Well!\" resumed the citizen, \"well, monsieur, my wife was abducted\nyesterday morning, as she was coming out of her workroom.\"\n\n\"And by whom was your wife abducted?\"\n\n\"I know nothing surely, monsieur, but I suspect someone.\"\n\n\"And who is the person whom you suspect?\"\n\n\"A man who has pursued her a long time.\"\n\n\"The devil!\"\n\n\"But allow me to tell you, monsieur,\" continued the citizen, \"that I am\nconvinced that there is less love than politics in all this.\"\n\n\"Less love than politics,\" replied d'Artagnan, with a reflective air;\n\"and what do you suspect?\"\n\n\"I do not know whether I ought to tell you what I suspect.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I beg you to observe that I ask you absolutely nothing. It\nis you who have come to me. It is you who have told me that you had a\nsecret to confide in me. Act, then, as you think proper; there is still\ntime to withdraw.\"\n\n\"No, monsieur, no; you appear to be an honest young man, and I will have\nconfidence in you. I believe, then, that it is not on account of any\nintrigues of her own that my wife has been arrested, but because of\nthose of a lady much greater than herself.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah! Can it be on account of the amours of Madame de Bois-Tracy?\"\nsaid d'Artagnan, wishing to have the air, in the eyes of the citizen, of\nbeing posted as to court affairs.\n\n\"Higher, monsieur, higher.\"\n\n\"Of Madame d'Aiguillon?\"\n\n\"Still higher.\"\n\n\"Of Madame de Chevreuse?\"\n\n\"Of the--\" d'Artagnan checked himself.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" replied the terrified citizen, in a tone so low that he\nwas scarcely audible.\n\n\"And with whom?\"\n\n\"With whom can it be, if not the Duke of--\"\n\n\"The Duke of--\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" replied the citizen, giving a still fainter intonation\nto his voice.\n\n\"But how do you know all this?\"\n\n\"How do I know it?\"\n\n\"Yes, how do you know it? No half-confidence, or--you understand!\"\n\n\"I know it from my wife, monsieur--from my wife herself.\"\n\n\"Who learns it from whom?\"\n\n\"From Monsieur Laporte. Did I not tell you that she was the goddaughter\nof Monsieur Laporte, the confidential man of the queen? Well, Monsieur\nLaporte placed her near her Majesty in order that our poor queen might\nat least have someone in whom she could place confidence, abandoned as\nshe is by the king, watched as she is by the cardinal, betrayed as she\nis by everybody.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah! It begins to develop itself,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Now, my wife came home four days ago, monsieur. One of her conditions\nwas that she should come and see me twice a week; for, as I had the\nhonor to tell you, my wife loves me dearly--my wife, then, came and\nconfided to me that the queen at that very moment entertained great\nfears.\"\n\n\"Truly!\"\n\n\"Yes. The cardinal, as it appears, pursues he and persecutes her more\nthan ever. He cannot pardon her the history of the Saraband. You know\nthe history of the Saraband?\"\n\n\"PARDIEU! Know it!\" replied d'Artagnan, who knew nothing about it, but\nwho wished to appear to know everything that was going on.\n\n\"So that now it is no longer hatred, but vengeance.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"And the queen believes--\"\n\n\"Well, what does the queen believe?\"\n\n\"She believes that someone has written to the Duke of Buckingham in her\nname.\"\n\n\"In the queen's name?\"\n\n\"Yes, to make him come to Paris; and when once come to Paris, to draw\nhim into some snare.\"\n\n\"The devil! But your wife, monsieur, what has she to do with all this?\"\n\n\"Her devotion to the queen is known; and they wish either to remove\nher from her mistress, or to intimidate her, in order to obtain her\nMajesty's secrets, or to seduce her and make use of her as a spy.\"\n\n\"That is likely,\" said d'Artagnan; \"but the man who has abducted her--do\nyou know him?\"\n\n\"I have told you that I believe I know him.\"\n\n\"His name?\"\n\n\"I do not know that; what I do know is that he is a creature of the\ncardinal, his evil genius.\"\n\n\"But you have seen him?\"\n\n\"Yes, my wife pointed him out to me one day.\"\n\n\"Has he anything remarkable about him by which one may recognize him?\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly; he is a noble of very lofty carriage, black hair,\nswarthy complexion, piercing eye, white teeth, and has a scar on his\ntemple.\"\n\n\"A scar on his temple!\" cried d'Artagnan; \"and with that, white teeth,\na piercing eye, dark complexion, black hair, and haughty carriage--why,\nthat's my man of Meung.\"\n\n\"He is your man, do you say?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; but that has nothing to do with it. No, I am wrong. On the\ncontrary, that simplifies the matter greatly. If your man is mine, with\none blow I shall obtain two revenges, that's all; but where to find this\nman?\"\n\n\"I know not.\"\n\n\"Have you no information as to his abiding place?\"\n\n\"None. One day, as I was conveying my wife back to the Louvre, he was\ncoming out as she was going in, and she showed him to me.\"\n\n\"The devil! The devil!\" murmured d'Artagnan; \"all this is vague enough.\nFrom whom have you learned of the abduction of your wife?\"\n\n\"From Monsieur Laporte.\"\n\n\"Did he give you any details?\"\n\n\"He knew none himself.\"\n\n\"And you have learned nothing from any other quarter?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have received--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I fear I am committing a great imprudence.\"\n\n\"You always come back to that; but I must make you see this time that it\nis too late to retreat.\"\n\n\"I do not retreat, MORDIEU!\" cried the citizen, swearing in order to\nrouse his courage. \"Besides, by the faith of Bonacieux--\"\n\n\"You call yourself Bonacieux?\" interrupted d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes, that is my name.\"\n\n\"You said, then, by the word of Bonacieux. Pardon me for interrupting\nyou, but it appears to me that that name is familiar to me.\"\n\n\"Possibly, monsieur. I am your landlord.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" said d'Artagnan, half rising and bowing; \"you are my\nlandlord?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, yes. And as it is three months since you have been here,\nand though, distracted as you must be in your important occupations, you\nhave forgotten to pay me my rent--as, I say, I have not tormented you a\nsingle instant, I thought you would appreciate my delicacy.\"\n\n\"How can it be otherwise, my dear Bonacieux?\" replied d'Artagnan; \"trust\nme, I am fully grateful for such unparalleled conduct, and if, as I told\nyou, I can be of any service to you--\"\n\n\"I believe you, monsieur, I believe you; and as I was about to say, by\nthe word of Bonacieux, I have confidence in you.\"\n\n\"Finish, then, what you were about to say.\"\n\nThe citizen took a paper from his pocket, and presented it to\nd'Artagnan.\n\n\"A letter?\" said the young man.\n\n\"Which I received this morning.\"\n\nD'Artagnan opened it, and as the day was beginning to decline, he\napproached the window to read it. The citizen followed him.\n\n\"'Do not seek your wife,'\" read d'Artagnan; \"'she will be restored to\nyou when there is no longer occasion for her. If you make a single step\nto find her you are lost.'\n\n\"That's pretty positive,\" continued d'Artagnan; \"but after all, it is\nbut a menace.\"\n\n\"Yes; but that menace terrifies me. I am not a fighting man at all,\nmonsieur, and I am afraid of the Bastille.\"\n\n\"Hum!\" said d'Artagnan. \"I have no greater regard for the Bastille than\nyou. If it were nothing but a sword thrust, why then--\"\n\n\"I have counted upon you on this occasion, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Seeing you constantly surrounded by Musketeers of a very superb\nappearance, and knowing that these Musketeers belong to Monsieur de\nTreville, and were consequently enemies of the cardinal, I thought that\nyou and your friends, while rendering justice to your poor queen, would\nbe pleased to play his Eminence an ill turn.\"\n\n\"Without doubt.\"\n\n\"And then I have thought that considering three months' lodging, about\nwhich I have said nothing--\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; you have already given me that reason, and I find it\nexcellent.\"\n\n\"Reckoning still further, that as long as you do me the honor to remain\nin my house I shall never speak to you about rent--\"\n\n\"Very kind!\"\n\n\"And adding to this, if there be need of it, meaning to offer you\nfifty pistoles, if, against all probability, you should be short at the\npresent moment.\"\n\n\"Admirable! You are rich then, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux?\"\n\n\"I am comfortably off, monsieur, that's all; I have scraped together\nsome such thing as an income of two or three thousand crown in the\nhaberdashery business, but more particularly in venturing some funds\nin the last voyage of the celebrated navigator Jean Moquet; so that you\nunderstand, monsieur--But--\" cried the citizen.\n\n\"What!\" demanded d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Whom do I see yonder?\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"In the street, facing your window, in the embrasure of that door--a man\nwrapped in a cloak.\"\n\n\"It is he!\" cried d'Artagnan and the citizen at the same time, each\nhaving recognized his man.\n\n\"Ah, this time,\" cried d'Artagnan, springing to his sword, \"this time he\nwill not escape me!\"\n\nDrawing his sword from its scabbard, he rushed out of the apartment. On\nthe staircase he met Athos and Porthos, who were coming to see him. They\nseparated, and d'Artagnan rushed between them like a dart.\n\n\"Pah! Where are you going?\" cried the two Musketeers in a breath.\n\n\"The man of Meung!\" replied d'Artagnan, and disappeared.\n\nD'Artagnan had more than once related to his friends his adventure with\nthe stranger, as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner, to\nwhom this man had confided some important missive.\n\nThe opinion of Athos was that d'Artagnan had lost his letter in the\nskirmish. A gentleman, in his opinion--and according to d'Artagnan's\nportrait of him, the stranger must be a gentleman--would be incapable of\nthe baseness of stealing a letter.\n\nPorthos saw nothing in all this but a love meeting, given by a lady to\na cavalier, or by a cavalier to a lady, which had been disturbed by the\npresence of d'Artagnan and his yellow horse.\n\nAramis said that as these sorts of affairs were mysterious, it was\nbetter not to fathom them.\n\nThey understood, then, from the few words which escaped from d'Artagnan,\nwhat affair was in hand, and as they thought that overtaking his man, or\nlosing sight of him, d'Artagnan would return to his rooms, they kept on\ntheir way.\n\nWhen they entered d'Artagnan's chamber, it was empty; the landlord,\ndreading the consequences of the encounter which was doubtless about to\ntake place between the young man and the stranger, had, consistent with\nthe character he had given himself, judged it prudent to decamp.\n\n\n\n\n9 D'ARTAGNAN SHOWS HIMSELF\n\nAs Athos and Porthos had foreseen, at the expiration of a half hour,\nd'Artagnan returned. He had again missed his man, who had disappeared\nas if by enchantment. D'Artagnan had run, sword in hand, through all the\nneighboring streets, but had found nobody resembling the man he sought\nfor. Then he came back to the point where, perhaps, he ought to have\nbegun, and that was to knock at the door against which the stranger had\nleaned; but this proved useless--for though he knocked ten or twelve\ntimes in succession, no one answered, and some of the neighbors, who put\ntheir noses out of their windows or were brought to their doors by the\nnoise, had assured him that that house, all the openings of which were\ntightly closed, had not been inhabited for six months.\n\nWhile d'Artagnan was running through the streets and knocking at doors,\nAramis had joined his companions; so that on returning home d'Artagnan\nfound the reunion complete.\n\n\"Well!\" cried the three Musketeers all together, on seeing d'Artagnan\nenter with his brow covered with perspiration and his countenance upset\nwith anger.\n\n\"Well!\" cried he, throwing his sword upon the bed, \"this man must be the\ndevil in person; he has disappeared like a phantom, like a shade, like a\nspecter.\"\n\n\"Do you believe in apparitions?\" asked Athos of Porthos.\n\n\"I never believe in anything I have not seen, and as I never have seen\napparitions, I don't believe in them.\"\n\n\"The Bible,\" said Aramis, \"make our belief in them a law; the ghost of\nSamuel appeared to Saul, and it is an article of faith that I should be\nvery sorry to see any doubt thrown upon, Porthos.\"\n\n\"At all events, man or devil, body or shadow, illusion or reality, this\nman is born for my damnation; for his flight has caused us to miss a\nglorious affair, gentlemen--an affair by which there were a hundred\npistoles, and perhaps more, to be gained.\"\n\n\"How is that?\" cried Porthos and Aramis in a breath.\n\nAs to Athos, faithful to his system of reticence, he contented himself\nwith interrogating d'Artagnan by a look.\n\n\"Planchet,\" said d'Artagnan to his domestic, who just then insinuated\nhis head through the half-open door in order to catch some fragments of\nthe conversation, \"go down to my landlord, Monsieur Bonacieux, and ask\nhim to send me half a dozen bottles of Beaugency wine; I prefer that.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah! You have credit with your landlord, then?\" asked Porthos.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied d'Artagnan, \"from this very day; and mind, if the wine is\nbad, we will send him to find better.\"\n\n\"We must use, and not abuse,\" said Aramis, sententiously.\n\n\"I always said that d'Artagnan had the longest head of the four,\" said\nAthos, who, having uttered his opinion, to which d'Artagnan replied with\na bow, immediately resumed his accustomed silence.\n\n\"But come, what is this about?\" asked Porthos.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Aramis, \"impart it to us, my dear friend, unless the honor\nof any lady be hazarded by this confidence; in that case you would do\nbetter to keep it to yourself.\"\n\n\"Be satisfied,\" replied d'Artagnan; \"the honor of no one will have cause\nto complain of what I have to tell.\"\n\nHe then related to his friends, word for word, all that had passed\nbetween him and his host, and how the man who had abducted the wife of\nhis worthy landlord was the same with whom he had had the difference at\nthe hostelry of the Jolly Miller.\n\n\"Your affair is not bad,\" said Athos, after having tasted like a\nconnoisseur and indicated by a nod of his head that he thought the wine\ngood; \"and one may draw fifty or sixty pistoles from this good man. Then\nthere only remains to ascertain whether these fifty or sixty pistoles\nare worth the risk of four heads.\"\n\n\"But observe,\" cried d'Artagnan, \"that there is a woman in the affair--a\nwoman carried off, a woman who is doubtless threatened, tortured\nperhaps, and all because she is faithful to her mistress.\"\n\n\"Beware, d'Artagnan, beware,\" said Aramis. \"You grow a little too warm,\nin my opinion, about the fate of Madame Bonacieux. Woman was created for\nour destruction, and it is from her we inherit all our miseries.\"\n\nAt this speech of Aramis, the brow of Athos became clouded and he bit\nhis lips.\n\n\"It is not Madame Bonacieux about whom I am anxious,\" cried d'Artagnan,\n\"but the queen, whom the king abandons, whom the cardinal persecutes,\nand who sees the heads of all her friends fall, one after the other.\"\n\n\"Why does she love what we hate most in the world, the Spaniards and the\nEnglish?\"\n\n\"Spain is her country,\" replied d'Artagnan; \"and it is very natural that\nshe should love the Spanish, who are the children of the same soil as\nherself. As to the second reproach, I have heard it said that she does\nnot love the English, but an Englishman.\"\n\n\"Well, and by my faith,\" said Athos, \"it must be acknowledged that this\nEnglishman is worthy of being loved. I never saw a man with a nobler air\nthan his.\"\n\n\"Without reckoning that he dresses as nobody else can,\" said Porthos. \"I\nwas at the Louvre on the day when he scattered his pearls; and, PARDIEU,\nI picked up two that I sold for ten pistoles each. Do you know him,\nAramis?\"\n\n\"As well as you do, gentlemen; for I was among those who seized him in\nthe garden at Amiens, into which Monsieur Putange, the queen's equerry,\nintroduced me. I was at school at the time, and the adventure appeared\nto me to be cruel for the king.\"\n\n\"Which would not prevent me,\" said d'Artagnan, \"if I knew where the Duke\nof Buckingham was, from taking him by the hand and conducting him to the\nqueen, were it only to enrage the cardinal, and if we could find means\nto play him a sharp turn, I vow that I would voluntarily risk my head in\ndoing it.\"\n\n\"And did the mercer*,\" rejoined Athos, \"tell you, d'Artagnan, that the\nqueen thought that Buckingham had been brought over by a forged letter?\"\n\n*Haberdasher\n\n\"She is afraid so.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute, then,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"What for?\" demanded Porthos.\n\n\"Go on, while I endeavor to recall circumstances.\"\n\n\"And now I am convinced,\" said d'Artagnan, \"that this abduction of the\nqueen's woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking, and\nperhaps with the presence of Buckingham in Paris.\"\n\n\"The Gascon is full of ideas,\" said Porthos, with admiration.\n\n\"I like to hear him talk,\" said Athos; \"his dialect amuses me.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" cried Aramis, \"listen to this.\"\n\n\"Listen to Aramis,\" said his three friends.\n\n\"Yesterday I was at the house of a doctor of theology, whom I sometimes\nconsult about my studies.\"\n\nAthos smiled.\n\n\"He resides in a quiet quarter,\" continued Aramis; \"his tastes and his\nprofession require it. Now, at the moment when I left his house--\"\n\nHere Aramis paused.\n\n\"Well,\" cried his auditors; \"at the moment you left his house?\"\n\nAramis appeared to make a strong inward effort, like a man who, in the\nfull relation of a falsehood, finds himself stopped by some unforeseen\nobstacle; but the eyes of his three companions were fixed upon him,\ntheir ears were wide open, and there were no means of retreat.\n\n\"This doctor has a niece,\" continued Aramis.\n\n\"Ah, he has a niece!\" interrupted Porthos.\n\n\"A very respectable lady,\" said Aramis.\n\nThe three friends burst into laughter.\n\n\"Ah, if you laugh, if you doubt me,\" replied Aramis, \"you shall know\nnothing.\"\n\n\"We believe like Mohammedans, and are as mute as tombstones,\" said\nAthos.\n\n\"I will continue, then,\" resumed Aramis. \"This niece comes sometimes to\nsee her uncle; and by chance was there yesterday at the same time that I\nwas, and it was my duty to offer to conduct her to her carriage.\"\n\n\"Ah! She has a carriage, then, this niece of the doctor?\" interrupted\nPorthos, one of whose faults was a great looseness of tongue. \"A nice\nacquaintance, my friend!\"\n\n\"Porthos,\" replied Aramis, \"I have had the occasion to observe to you\nmore than once that you are very indiscreet; and that is injurious to\nyou among the women.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen, gentlemen,\" cried d'Artagnan, who began to get a glimpse of\nthe result of the adventure, \"the thing is serious. Let us try not to\njest, if we can. Go on Aramis, go on.\"\n\n\"All at once, a tall, dark gentleman--just like yours, d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"The same, perhaps,\" said he.\n\n\"Possibly,\" continued Aramis, \"came toward me, accompanied by five or\nsix men who followed about ten paces behind him; and in the politest\ntone, 'Monsieur Duke,' said he to me, 'and you madame,' continued he,\naddressing the lady on my arm--\"\n\n\"The doctor's niece?\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, Porthos,\" said Athos; \"you are insupportable.\"\n\n\"'--will you enter this carriage, and that without offering the least\nresistance, without making the least noise?'\"\n\n\"He took you for Buckingham!\" cried d'Artagnan.\n\n\"I believe so,\" replied Aramis.\n\n\"But the lady?\" asked Porthos.\n\n\"He took her for the queen!\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Just so,\" replied Aramis.\n\n\"The Gascon is the devil!\" cried Athos; \"nothing escapes him.\"\n\n\"The fact is,\" said Porthos, \"Aramis is of the same height, and\nsomething of the shape of the duke; but it nevertheless appears to me\nthat the dress of a Musketeer--\"\n\n\"I wore an enormous cloak,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"In the month of July? The devil!\" said Porthos. \"Is the doctor afraid\nthat you may be recognized?\"\n\n\"I can comprehend that the spy may have been deceived by the person; but\nthe face--\"\n\n\"I had a large hat,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Oh, good lord,\" cried Porthos, \"what precautions for the study of\ntheology!\"\n\n\"Gentlemen, gentlemen,\" said d'Artagnan, \"do not let us lose our time in\njesting. Let us separate, and let us seek the mercer's wife--that is the\nkey of the intrigue.\"\n\n\"A woman of such inferior condition! Can you believe so?\" said Porthos,\nprotruding his lips with contempt.\n\n\"She is goddaughter to Laporte, the confidential valet of the queen.\nHave I not told you so, gentlemen? Besides, it has perhaps been her\nMajesty's calculation to seek on this occasion for support so\nlowly. High heads expose themselves from afar, and the cardinal is\nlongsighted.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Porthos, \"in the first place make a bargain with the\nmercer, and a good bargain.\"\n\n\"That's useless,\" said d'Artagnan; \"for I believe if he does not pay us,\nwe shall be well enough paid by another party.\"\n\nAt this moment a sudden noise of footsteps was heard upon the stairs;\nthe door was thrown violently open, and the unfortunate mercer rushed\ninto the chamber in which the council was held.\n\n\"Save me, gentlemen, for the love of heaven, save me!\" cried he. \"There\nare four men come to arrest me. Save me! Save me!\"\n\nPorthos and Aramis arose.\n\n\"A moment,\" cried d'Artagnan, making them a sign to replace in the\nscabbard their half-drawn swords. \"It is not courage that is needed; it\nis prudence.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" cried Porthos, \"we will not leave--\"\n\n\"You will leave d'Artagnan to act as he thinks proper,\" said Athos. \"He\nhas, I repeat, the longest head of the four, and for my part I declare\nthat I will obey him. Do as you think best, d'Artagnan.\"\n\nAt this moment the four Guards appeared at the door of the antechamber,\nbut seeing four Musketeers standing, and their swords by their sides,\nthey hesitated about going farther.\n\n\"Come in, gentlemen, come in,\" called d'Artagnan; \"you are here in my\napartment, and we are all faithful servants of the king and cardinal.\"\n\n\"Then, gentlemen, you will not oppose our executing the orders we have\nreceived?\" asked one who appeared to be the leader of the party.\n\n\"On the contrary, gentlemen, we would assist you if it were necessary.\"\n\n\"What does he say?\" grumbled Porthos.\n\n\"You are a simpleton,\" said Athos. \"Silence!\"\n\n\"But you promised me--\" whispered the poor mercer.\n\n\"We can only save you by being free ourselves,\" replied d'Artagnan, in\na rapid, low tone; \"and if we appear inclined to defend you, they will\narrest us with you.\"\n\n\"It seems, nevertheless--\"\n\n\"Come, gentlemen, come!\" said d'Artagnan, aloud; \"I have no motive for\ndefending Monsieur. I saw him today for the first time, and he can tell\nyou on what occasion; he came to demand the rent of my lodging. Is that\nnot true, Monsieur Bonacieux? Answer!\"\n\n\"That is the very truth,\" cried the mercer; \"but Monsieur does not tell\nyou--\"\n\n\"Silence, with respect to me, silence, with respect to my friends;\nsilence about the queen, above all, or you will ruin everybody without\nsaving yourself! Come, come, gentlemen, remove the fellow.\" And\nd'Artagnan pushed the half-stupefied mercer among the Guards, saying to\nhim, \"You are a shabby old fellow, my dear. You come to demand money of\nme--of a Musketeer! To prison with him! Gentlemen, once more, take him\nto prison, and keep him under key as long as possible; that will give me\ntime to pay him.\"\n\nThe officers were full of thanks, and took away their prey. As they were\ngoing down d'Artagnan laid his hand on the shoulder of their leader.\n\n\"May I not drink to your health, and you to mine?\" said d'Artagnan,\nfilling two glasses with the Beaugency wine which he had obtained from\nthe liberality of M. Bonacieux.\n\n\"That will do me great honor,\" said the leader of the posse, \"and I\naccept thankfully.\"\n\n\"Then to yours, monsieur--what is your name?\"\n\n\"Boisrenard.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Boisrenard.\"\n\n\"To yours, my gentlemen! What is your name, in your turn, if you\nplease?\"\n\n\"d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"To yours, monsieur.\"\n\n\"And above all others,\" cried d'Artagnan, as if carried away by his\nenthusiasm, \"to that of the king and the cardinal.\"\n\nThe leader of the posse would perhaps have doubted the sincerity of\nd'Artagnan if the wine had been bad; but the wine was good, and he was\nconvinced.\n\n\"What diabolical villainy you have performed here,\" said Porthos, when\nthe officer had rejoined his companions and the four friends found\nthemselves alone. \"Shame, shame, for four Musketeers to allow an\nunfortunate fellow who cried for help to be arrested in their midst! And\na gentleman to hobnob with a bailiff!\"\n\n\"Porthos,\" said Aramis, \"Athos has already told you that you are a\nsimpleton, and I am quite of his opinion. D'Artagnan, you are a great\nman; and when you occupy Monsieur de Treville's place, I will come and\nask your influence to secure me an abbey.\"\n\n\"Well, I am in a maze,\" said Porthos; \"do YOU approve of what d'Artagnan\nhas done?\"\n\n\"PARBLEU! Indeed I do,\" said Athos; \"I not only approve of what he has\ndone, but I congratulate him upon it.\"\n\n\"And now, gentlemen,\" said d'Artagnan, without stopping to explain his\nconduct to Porthos, \"All for one, one for all--that is our motto, is it\nnot?\"\n\n\"And yet--\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Hold out your hand and swear!\" cried Athos and Aramis at once.\n\nOvercome by example, grumbling to himself, nevertheless, Porthos\nstretched out his hand, and the four friends repeated with one voice the\nformula dictated by d'Artagnan:\n\n\"All for one, one for all.\"\n\n\"That's well! Now let us everyone retire to his own home,\" said\nd'Artagnan, as if he had done nothing but command all his life; \"and\nattention! For from this moment we are at feud with the cardinal.\"\n\n\n\n\n10 A MOUSETRAP IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY\n\nThe invention of the mousetrap does not date from our days; as soon\nas societies, in forming, had invented any kind of police, that police\ninvented mousetraps.\n\nAs perhaps our readers are not familiar with the slang of the Rue de\nJerusalem, and as it is fifteen years since we applied this word for\nthe first time to this thing, allow us to explain to them what is a\nmousetrap.\n\nWhen in a house, of whatever kind it may be, an individual suspected of\nany crime is arrested, the arrest is held secret. Four or five men are\nplaced in ambuscade in the first room. The door is opened to all who\nknock. It is closed after them, and they are arrested; so that at\nthe end of two or three days they have in their power almost all the\nHABITUES of the establishment. And that is a mousetrap.\n\nThe apartment of M. Bonacieux, then, became a mousetrap; and whoever\nappeared there was taken and interrogated by the cardinal's people. It\nmust be observed that as a separate passage led to the first floor, in\nwhich d'Artagnan lodged, those who called on him were exempted from this\ndetention.\n\nBesides, nobody came thither but the three Musketeers; they had all been\nengaged in earnest search and inquiries, but had discovered nothing.\nAthos had even gone so far as to question M. de Treville--a thing which,\nconsidering the habitual reticence of the worthy Musketeer, had very\nmuch astonished his captain. But M. de Treville knew nothing, except\nthat the last time he had seen the cardinal, the king, and the queen,\nthe cardinal looked very thoughtful, the king uneasy, and the redness\nof the queen's eyes donated that she had been sleepless or tearful. But\nthis last circumstance was not striking, as the queen since her marriage\nhad slept badly and wept much.\n\nM. de Treville requested Athos, whatever might happen, to be observant\nof his duty to the king, but particularly to the queen, begging him to\nconvey his desires to his comrades.\n\nAs to d'Artagnan, he did not budge from his apartment. He converted his\nchamber into an observatory. From his windows he saw all the visitors\nwho were caught. Then, having removed a plank from his floor, and\nnothing remaining but a simple ceiling between him and the room beneath,\nin which the interrogatories were made, he heard all that passed between\nthe inquisitors and the accused.\n\nThe interrogatories, preceded by a minute search operated upon the\npersons arrested, were almost always framed thus: \"Has Madame Bonacieux\nsent anything to you for her husband, or any other person? Has Monsieur\nBonacieux sent anything to you for his wife, or for any other person?\nHas either of them confided anything to you by word of mouth?\"\n\n\"If they knew anything, they would not question people in this manner,\"\nsaid d'Artagnan to himself. \"Now, what is it they want to know? Why,\nthey want to know if the Duke of Buckingham is in Paris, and if he has\nhad, or is likely to have, an interview with the queen.\"\n\nD'Artagnan held onto this idea, which, from what he had heard, was not\nwanting in probability.\n\nIn the meantime, the mousetrap continued in operation, and likewise\nd'Artagnan's vigilance.\n\nOn the evening of the day after the arrest of poor Bonacieux, as Athos\nhad just left d'Artagnan to report at M. de Treville's, as nine o'clock\nhad just struck, and as Planchet, who had not yet made the bed, was\nbeginning his task, a knocking was heard at the street door. The door\nwas instantly opened and shut; someone was taken in the mousetrap.\n\nD'Artagnan flew to his hole, laid himself down on the floor at full\nlength, and listened.\n\nCries were soon heard, and then moans, which someone appeared to be\nendeavoring to stifle. There were no questions.\n\n\"The devil!\" said d'Artagnan to himself. \"It seems like a woman! They\nsearch her; she resists; they use force--the scoundrels!\"\n\nIn spite of his prudence, d'Artagnan restrained himself with great\ndifficulty from taking a part in the scene that was going on below.\n\n\"But I tell you that I am the mistress of the house, gentlemen! I tell\nyou I am Madame Bonacieux; I tell you I belong to the queen!\" cried the\nunfortunate woman.\n\n\"Madame Bonacieux!\" murmured d'Artagnan. \"Can I be so lucky as to find\nwhat everybody is seeking for?\"\n\nThe voice became more and more indistinct; a tumultuous movement shook\nthe partition. The victim resisted as much as a woman could resist four\nmen.\n\n\"Pardon, gentlemen--par--\" murmured the voice, which could now only be\nheard in inarticulate sounds.\n\n\"They are binding her; they are going to drag her away,\" cried\nd'Artagnan to himself, springing up from the floor. \"My sword! Good, it\nis by my side! Planchet!\"\n\n\"Monsieur.\"\n\n\"Run and seek Athos, Porthos and Aramis. One of the three will certainly\nbe at home, perhaps all three. Tell them to take arms, to come here, and\nto run! Ah, I remember, Athos is at Monsieur de Treville's.\"\n\n\"But where are you going, monsieur, where are you going?\"\n\n\"I am going down by the window, in order to be there the sooner,\" cried\nd'Artagnan. \"You put back the boards, sweep the floor, go out at the\ndoor, and run as I told you.\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur! Monsieur! You will kill yourself,\" cried Planchet.\n\n\"Hold your tongue, stupid fellow,\" said d'Artagnan; and laying hold of\nthe casement, he let himself gently down from the first story, which\nfortunately was not very elevated, without doing himself the slightest\ninjury.\n\nHe then went straight to the door and knocked, murmuring, \"I will go\nmyself and be caught in the mousetrap, but woe be to the cats that shall\npounce upon such a mouse!\"\n\nThe knocker had scarcely sounded under the hand of the young man\nbefore the tumult ceased, steps approached, the door was opened, and\nd'Artagnan, sword in hand, rushed into the rooms of M. Bonacieux, the\ndoor of which doubtless acted upon by a spring, closed after him.\n\nThen those who dwelt in Bonacieux's unfortunate house, together with\nthe nearest neighbors, heard loud cries, stamping of feet, clashing of\nswords, and breaking of furniture. A moment after, those who, surprised\nby this tumult, had gone to their windows to learn the cause of it, saw\nthe door open, and four men, clothed in black, not COME out of it, but\nFLY, like so many frightened crows, leaving on the ground and on the\ncorners of the furniture, feathers from their wings; that is to say,\npatches of their clothes and fragments of their cloaks.\n\nD'Artagnan was conqueror--without much effort, it must be confessed,\nfor only one of the officers was armed, and even he defended himself for\nform's sake. It is true that the three others had endeavored to knock\nthe young man down with chairs, stools, and crockery; but two or\nthree scratches made by the Gascon's blade terrified them. Ten minutes\nsufficed for their defeat, and d'Artagnan remained master of the field\nof battle.\n\nThe neighbors who had opened their windows, with the coolness peculiar\nto the inhabitants of Paris in these times of perpetual riots and\ndisturbances, closed them again as soon as they saw the four men in\nblack flee--their instinct telling them that for the time all was over.\nBesides, it began to grow late, and then, as today, people went to bed\nearly in the quarter of the Luxembourg.\n\nOn being left alone with Mme. Bonacieux, d'Artagnan turned toward her;\nthe poor woman reclined where she had been left, half-fainting upon an\narmchair. D'Artagnan examined her with a rapid glance.\n\nShe was a charming woman of twenty-five or twenty-six years, with dark\nhair, blue eyes, and a nose slightly turned up, admirable teeth, and a\ncomplexion marbled with rose and opal. There, however, ended the signs\nwhich might have confounded her with a lady of rank. The hands were\nwhite, but without delicacy; the feet did not bespeak the woman of\nquality. Happily, d'Artagnan was not yet acquainted with such niceties.\n\nWhile d'Artagnan was examining Mme. Bonacieux, and was, as we have said,\nclose to her, he saw on the ground a fine cambric handkerchief, which\nhe picked up, as was his habit, and at the corner of which he recognized\nthe same cipher he had seen on the handkerchief which had nearly caused\nhim and Aramis to cut each other's throat.\n\nFrom that time, d'Artagnan had been cautious with respect to\nhandkerchiefs with arms on them, and he therefore placed in the pocket\nof Mme. Bonacieux the one he had just picked up.\n\nAt that moment Mme. Bonacieux recovered her senses. She opened her eyes,\nlooked around her with terror, saw that the apartment was empty and that\nshe was alone with her liberator. She extended her hands to him with a\nsmile. Mme. Bonacieux had the sweetest smile in the world.\n\n\"Ah, monsieur!\" said she, \"you have saved me; permit me to thank you.\"\n\n\"Madame,\" said d'Artagnan, \"I have only done what every gentleman would\nhave done in my place; you owe me no thanks.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, monsieur, oh, yes; and I hope to prove to you that you have\nnot served an ingrate. But what could these men, whom I at first took\nfor robbers, want with me, and why is Monsieur Bonacieux not here?\"\n\n\"Madame, those men were more dangerous than any robbers could have\nbeen, for they are the agents of the cardinal; and as to your husband,\nMonsieur Bonacieux, he is not here because he was yesterday evening\nconducted to the Bastille.\"\n\n\"My husband in the Bastille!\" cried Mme. Bonacieux. \"Oh, my God! What\nhas he done? Poor dear man, he is innocence itself!\"\n\nAnd something like a faint smile lighted the still-terrified features of\nthe young woman.\n\n\"What has he done, madame?\" said d'Artagnan. \"I believe that his only\ncrime is to have at the same time the good fortune and the misfortune to\nbe your husband.\"\n\n\"But, monsieur, you know then--\"\n\n\"I know that you have been abducted, madame.\"\n\n\"And by whom? Do you know him? Oh, if you know him, tell me!\"\n\n\"By a man of from forty to forty-five years, with black hair, a dark\ncomplexion, and a scar on his left temple.\"\n\n\"That is he, that is he; but his name?\"\n\n\"Ah, his name? I do not know that.\"\n\n\"And did my husband know I had been carried off?\"\n\n\"He was informed of it by a letter, written to him by the abductor\nhimself.\"\n\n\"And does he suspect,\" said Mme. Bonacieux, with some embarrassment,\n\"the cause of this event?\"\n\n\"He attributed it, I believe, to a political cause.\"\n\n\"I doubted from the first; and now I think entirely as he does. Then my\ndear Monsieur Bonacieux has not suspected me a single instant?\"\n\n\"So far from it, madame, he was too proud of your prudence, and above\nall, of your love.\"\n\nA second smile, almost imperceptible, stole over the rosy lips of the\npretty young woman.\n\n\"But,\" continued d'Artagnan, \"how did you escape?\"\n\n\"I took advantage of a moment when they left me alone; and as I had\nknown since morning the reason of my abduction, with the help of the\nsheets I let myself down from the window. Then, as I believed my husband\nwould be at home, I hastened hither.\"\n\n\"To place yourself under his protection?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, poor dear man! I knew very well that he was incapable of\ndefending me; but as he could serve us in other ways, I wished to inform\nhim.\"\n\n\"Of what?\"\n\n\"Oh, that is not my secret; I must not, therefore, tell you.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" said d'Artagnan, \"pardon me, madame, if, guardsman as I am,\nI remind you of prudence--besides, I believe we are not here in a very\nproper place for imparting confidences. The men I have put to flight\nwill return reinforced; if they find us here, we are lost. I have sent\nfor three of my friends, but who knows whether they were at home?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes! You are right,\" cried the affrighted Mme. Bonacieux; \"let us\nfly! Let us save ourselves.\"\n\nAt these words she passed her arm under that of d'Artagnan, and urged\nhim forward eagerly.\n\n\"But whither shall we fly--whither escape?\"\n\n\"Let us first withdraw from this house; afterward we shall see.\"\n\nThe young woman and the young man, without taking the trouble to shut\nthe door after them, descended the Rue des Fossoyeurs rapidly, turned\ninto the Rue des Fosses-Monsieur-le-Prince, and did not stop till they\ncame to the Place St. Sulpice.\n\n\"And now what are we to do, and where do you wish me to conduct you?\"\nasked d'Artagnan.\n\n\"I am at quite a loss how to answer you, I admit,\" said Mme. Bonacieux.\n\"My intention was to inform Monsieur Laporte, through my husband, in\norder that Monsieur Laporte might tell us precisely what had taken place\nat the Louvre in the last three days, and whether there is any danger in\npresenting myself there.\"\n\n\"But I,\" said d'Artagnan, \"can go and inform Monsieur Laporte.\"\n\n\"No doubt you could, only there is one misfortune, and that is that\nMonsieur Bonacieux is known at the Louvre, and would be allowed to pass;\nwhereas you are not known there, and the gate would be closed against\nyou.\"\n\n\"Ah, bah!\" said d'Artagnan; \"you have at some wicket of the Louvre a\nCONCIERGE who is devoted to you, and who, thanks to a password, would--\"\n\nMme. Bonacieux looked earnestly at the young man.\n\n\"And if I give you this password,\" said she, \"would you forget it as\nsoon as you used it?\"\n\n\"By my honor, by the faith of a gentleman!\" said d'Artagnan, with an\naccent so truthful that no one could mistake it.\n\n\"Then I believe you. You appear to be a brave young man; besides, your\nfortune may perhaps be the result of your devotedness.\"\n\n\n\"I will do, without a promise and voluntarily, all that I can do to\nserve the king and be agreeable to the queen. Dispose of me, then, as a\nfriend.\"\n\n\"But I--where shall I go meanwhile?\"\n\n\"Is there nobody from whose house Monsieur Laporte can come and fetch\nyou?\"\n\n\"No, I can trust nobody.\"\n\n\"Stop,\" said d'Artagnan; \"we are near Athos's door. Yes, here it is.\"\n\n\"Who is this Athos?\"\n\n\"One of my friends.\"\n\n\"But if he should be at home and see me?\"\n\n\"He is not at home, and I will carry away the key, after having placed\nyou in his apartment.\"\n\n\"But if he should return?\"\n\n\"Oh, he won't return; and if he should, he will be told that I have\nbrought a woman with me, and that woman is in his apartment.\"\n\n\"But that will compromise me sadly, you know.\"\n\n\"Of what consequence? Nobody knows you. Besides, we are in a situation\nto overlook ceremony.\"\n\n\"Come, then, let us go to your friend's house. Where does he live?\"\n\n\"Rue Ferou, two steps from here.\"\n\n\"Let us go!\"\n\nBoth resumed their way. As d'Artagnan had foreseen, Athos was not\nwithin. He took the key, which was customarily given him as one of the\nfamily, ascended the stairs, and introduced Mme. Bonacieux into the\nlittle apartment of which we have given a description.\n\n\"You are at home,\" said he. \"Remain here, fasten the door inside, and\nopen it to nobody unless you hear three taps like this;\" and he tapped\nthrice--two taps close together and pretty hard, the other after an\ninterval, and lighter.\n\n\"That is well,\" said Mme. Bonacieux. \"Now, in my turn, let me give you\nmy instructions.\"\n\n\"I am all attention.\"\n\n\"Present yourself at the wicket of the Louvre, on the side of the Rue de\nl'Echelle, and ask for Germain.\"\n\n\"Well, and then?\"\n\n\"He will ask you what you want, and you will answer by these two words,\n'Tours' and 'Bruxelles.' He will at once put himself at your orders.\"\n\n\"And what shall I command him?\"\n\n\"To go and fetch Monsieur Laporte, the queen's VALET DE CHAMBRE.\"\n\n\"And when he shall have informed him, and Monsieur Laporte is come?\"\n\n\"You will send him to me.\"\n\n\"That is well; but where and how shall I see you again?\"\n\n\"Do you wish to see me again?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Well, let that care be mine, and be at ease.\"\n\n\"I depend upon your word.\"\n\n\"You may.\"\n\nD'Artagnan bowed to Mme. Bonacieux, darting at her the most loving\nglance that he could possibly concentrate upon her charming little\nperson; and while he descended the stairs, he heard the door closed and\ndouble-locked. In two bounds he was at the Louvre; as he entered\nthe wicket of L'Echelle, ten o'clock struck. All the events we have\ndescribed had taken place within a half hour.\n\nEverything fell out as Mme. Bonacieux prophesied. On hearing the\npassword, Germain bowed. In a few minutes, Laporte was at the lodge;\nin two words d'Artagnan informed him where Mme. Bonacieux was. Laporte\nassured himself, by having it twice repeated, of the accurate address,\nand set off at a run. Hardly, however, had he taken ten steps before he\nreturned.\n\n\"Young man,\" said he to d'Artagnan, \"a suggestion.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You may get into trouble by what has taken place.\"\n\n\"You believe so?\"\n\n\"Yes. Have you any friend whose clock is too slow?\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Go and call upon him, in order that he may give evidence of your having\nbeen with him at half past nine. In a court of justice that is called an\nalibi.\"\n\nD'Artagnan found his advice prudent. He took to his heels, and was soon\nat M. de Treville's; but instead of going into the saloon with the rest\nof the crowd, he asked to be introduced to M. de Treville's office. As\nd'Artagnan so constantly frequented the hotel, no difficulty was made in\ncomplying with his request, and a servant went to inform M. de Treville\nthat his young compatriot, having something important to communicate,\nsolicited a private audience. Five minutes after, M. de Treville was\nasking d'Artagnan what he could do to serve him, and what caused his\nvisit at so late an hour.\n\n\"Pardon me, monsieur,\" said d'Artagnan, who had profited by the moment\nhe had been left alone to put back M. de Treville's clock three-quarters\nof an hour, \"but I thought, as it was yet only twenty-five minutes past\nnine, it was not too late to wait upon you.\"\n\n\"Twenty-five minutes past nine!\" cried M. de Treville, looking at the\nclock; \"why, that's impossible!\"\n\n\"Look, rather, monsieur,\" said d'Artagnan, \"the clock shows it.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said M. de Treville; \"I believed it later. But what can I\ndo for you?\"\n\nThen d'Artagnan told M. de Treville a long history about the queen. He\nexpressed to him the fears he entertained with respect to her Majesty;\nhe related to him what he had heard of the projects of the cardinal with\nregard to Buckingham, and all with a tranquillity and candor of which M.\nde Treville was the more the dupe, from having himself, as we have said,\nobserved something fresh between the cardinal, the king, and the queen.\n\nAs ten o'clock was striking, d'Artagnan left M. de Treville, who thanked\nhim for his information, recommended him to have the service of the king\nand queen always at heart, and returned to the saloon; but at the foot\nof the stairs, d'Artagnan remembered he had forgotten his cane. He\nconsequently sprang up again, re-entered the office, with a turn of his\nfinger set the clock right again, that it might not be perceived the\nnext day that it had been put wrong, and certain from that time that\nhe had a witness to prove his alibi, he ran downstairs and soon found\nhimself in the street.\n\n\n\n\n11 IN WHICH THE PLOT THICKENS\n\nHis visit to M. de Treville being paid, the pensive d'Artagnan took the\nlongest way homeward.\n\nOn what was d'Artagnan thinking, that he strayed thus from his path,\ngazing at the stars of heaven, and sometimes sighing, sometimes smiling?\n\nHe was thinking of Mme. Bonacieux. For an apprentice Musketeer the young\nwoman was almost an ideal of love. Pretty, mysterious, initiated in\nalmost all the secrets of the court, which reflected such a charming\ngravity over her pleasing features, it might be surmised that she was\nnot wholly unmoved; and this is an irresistible charm to novices in\nlove. Moreover, d'Artagnan had delivered her from the hands of the\ndemons who wished to search and ill treat her; and this important\nservice had established between them one of those sentiments of\ngratitude which so easily assume a more tender character.\n\nD'Artagnan already fancied himself, so rapid is the flight of our dreams\nupon the wings of imagination, accosted by a messenger from the young\nwoman, who brought him some billet appointing a meeting, a gold chain,\nor a diamond. We have observed that young cavaliers received presents\nfrom their king without shame. Let us add that in these times of lax\nmorality they had no more delicacy with respect to the mistresses;\nand that the latter almost always left them valuable and durable\nremembrances, as if they essayed to conquer the fragility of their\nsentiments by the solidity of their gifts.\n\nWithout a blush, men made their way in the world by the means of women\nblushing. Such as were only beautiful gave their beauty, whence, without\ndoubt, comes the proverb, \"The most beautiful girl in the world can only\ngive what she has.\" Such as were rich gave in addition a part of their\nmoney; and a vast number of heroes of that gallant period may be cited\nwho would neither have won their spurs in the first place, nor their\nbattles afterward, without the purse, more or less furnished, which\ntheir mistress fastened to the saddle bow.\n\nD'Artagnan owned nothing. Provincial diffidence, that slight varnish,\nthe ephemeral flower, that down of the peach, had evaporated to the\nwinds through the little orthodox counsels which the three Musketeers\ngave their friend. D'Artagnan, following the strange custom of the\ntimes, considered himself at Paris as on a campaign, neither more nor\nless than if he had been in Flanders--Spain yonder, woman here. In each\nthere was an enemy to contend with, and contributions to be levied.\n\nBut, we must say, at the present moment d'Artagnan was ruled by a\nfeeling much more noble and disinterested. The mercer had said that he\nwas rich; the young man might easily guess that with so weak a man as M.\nBonacieux; and interest was almost foreign to this commencement of love,\nwhich had been the consequence of it. We say ALMOST, for the idea that\na young, handsome, kind, and witty woman is at the same time rich takes\nnothing from the beginning of love, but on the contrary strengthens it.\n\nThere are in affluence a crowd of aristocratic cares and caprices which\nare highly becoming to beauty. A fine and white stocking, a silken robe,\na lace kerchief, a pretty slipper on the foot, a tasty ribbon on the\nhead do not make an ugly woman pretty, but they make a pretty woman\nbeautiful, without reckoning the hands, which gain by all this; the\nhands, among women particularly, to be beautiful must be idle.\n\nThen d'Artagnan, as the reader, from whom we have not concealed the\nstate of his fortune, very well knows--d'Artagnan was not a millionaire;\nhe hoped to become one someday, but the time which in his own mind\nhe fixed upon for this happy change was still far distant. In the\nmeanwhile, how disheartening to see the woman one loves long for those\nthousands of nothings which constitute a woman's happiness, and be\nunable to give her those thousands of nothings. At least, when the woman\nis rich and the lover is not, that which he cannot offer she offers to\nherself; and although it is generally with her husband's money that she\nprocures herself this indulgence, the gratitude for it seldom reverts to\nhim.\n\nThen d'Artagnan, disposed to become the most tender of lovers, was\nat the same time a very devoted friend, In the midst of his amorous\nprojects for the mercer's wife, he did not forget his friends. The\npretty Mme. Bonacieux was just the woman to walk with in the Plain St.\nDenis or in the fair of St. Germain, in company with Athos, Porthos, and\nAramis, to whom d'Artagnan had often remarked this. Then one could enjoy\ncharming little dinners, where one touches on one side the hand of a\nfriend, and on the other the foot of a mistress. Besides, on pressing\noccasions, in extreme difficulties, d'Artagnan would become the\npreserver of his friends.\n\nAnd M. Bonacieux? whom d'Artagnan had pushed into the hands of the\nofficers, denying him aloud although he had promised in a whisper to\nsave him. We are compelled to admit to our readers that d'Artagnan\nthought nothing about him in any way; or that if he did think of him, it\nwas only to say to himself that he was very well where he was, wherever\nit might be. Love is the most selfish of all the passions.\n\nLet our readers reassure themselves. IF d'Artagnan forgets his host, or\nappears to forget him, under the pretense of not knowing where he has\nbeen carried, we will not forget him, and we know where he is. But for\nthe moment, let us do as did the amorous Gascon; we will see after the\nworthy mercer later.\n\nD'Artagnan, reflecting on his future amours, addressing himself to\nthe beautiful night, and smiling at the stars, ascended the Rue\nCherish-Midi, or Chase-Midi, as it was then called. As he found himself\nin the quarter in which Aramis lived, he took it into his head to pay\nhis friend a visit in order to explain the motives which had led him\nto send Planchet with a request that he would come instantly to the\nmousetrap. Now, if Aramis had been at home when Planchet came to his\nabode, he had doubtless hastened to the Rue des Fossoyeurs, and finding\nnobody there but his other two companions perhaps, they would not\nbe able to conceive what all this meant. This mystery required an\nexplanation; at least, so d'Artagnan declared to himself.\n\nHe likewise thought this was an opportunity for talking about pretty\nlittle Mme. Bonacieux, of whom his head, if not his heart, was already\nfull. We must never look for discretion in first love. First love is\naccompanied by such excessive joy that unless the joy be allowed to\noverflow, it will stifle you.\n\nParis for two hours past had been dark, and seemed a desert. Eleven\no'clock sounded from all the clocks of the Faubourg St. Germain. It\nwas delightful weather. D'Artagnan was passing along a lane on the spot\nwhere the Rue d'Assas is now situated, breathing the balmy emanations\nwhich were borne upon the wind from the Rue de Vaugirard, and which\narose from the gardens refreshed by the dews of evening and the\nbreeze of night. From a distance resounded, deadened, however, by good\nshutters, the songs of the tipplers, enjoying themselves in the cabarets\nscattered along the plain. Arrived at the end of the lane, d'Artagnan\nturned to the left. The house in which Aramis dwelt was situated between\nthe Rue Cassette and the Rue Servandoni.\n\nD'Artagnan had just passed the Rue Cassette, and already perceived the\ndoor of his friend's house, shaded by a mass of sycamores and clematis\nwhich formed a vast arch opposite the front of it, when he perceived\nsomething like a shadow issuing from the Rue Servandoni. This something\nwas enveloped in a cloak, and d'Artagnan at first believed it was a man;\nbut by the smallness of the form, the hesitation of the walk, and the\nindecision of the step, he soon discovered that it was a woman. Further,\nthis woman, as if not certain of the house she was seeking, lifted up\nher eyes to look around her, stopped, went backward, and then returned\nagain. D'Artagnan was perplexed.\n\n\"Shall I go and offer her my services?\" thought he. \"By her step she\nmust be young; perhaps she is pretty. Oh, yes! But a woman who wanders\nin the streets at this hour only ventures out to meet her lover. If\nI should disturb a rendezvous, that would not be the best means of\ncommencing an acquaintance.\"\n\nMeantime the young woman continued to advance, counting the houses\nand windows. This was neither long nor difficult. There were but three\nhotels in this part of the street; and only two windows looking toward\nthe road, one of which was in a pavilion parallel to that which Aramis\noccupied, the other belonging to Aramis himself.\n\n\"PARIDIEU!\" said d'Artagnan to himself, to whose mind the niece of the\ntheologian reverted, \"PARDIEU, it would be droll if this belated dove\nshould be in search of our friend's house. But on my soul, it looks so.\nAh, my dear Aramis, this time I shall find you out.\" And d'Artagnan,\nmaking himself as small as he could, concealed himself in the darkest\nside of the street near a stone bench placed at the back of a niche.\n\nThe young woman continued to advance; and in addition to the lightness\nof her step, which had betrayed her, she emitted a little cough which\ndenoted a sweet voice. D'Artagnan believed this cough to be a signal.\n\nNevertheless, whether the cough had been answered by a similar signal\nwhich had fixed the irresolution of the nocturnal seeker, or whether\nwithout this aid she saw that she had arrived at the end of her journey,\nshe resolutely drew near to Aramis's shutter, and tapped, at three equal\nintervals, with her bent finger.\n\n\"This is all very fine, dear Aramis,\" murmured d'Artagnan. \"Ah, Monsieur\nHypocrite, I understand how you study theology.\"\n\nThe three blows were scarcely struck, when the inside blind was opened\nand a light appeared through the panes of the outside shutter.\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" said the listener, \"not through doors, but through windows!\nAh, this visit was expected. We shall see the windows open, and the lady\nenter by escalade. Very pretty!\"\n\nBut to the great astonishment of d'Artagnan, the shutter remained\nclosed. Still more, the light which had shone for an instant\ndisappeared, and all was again in obscurity.\n\nD'Artagnan thought this could not last long, and continued to look with\nall his eyes and listen with all his ears.\n\nHe was right; at the end of some seconds two sharp taps were heard\ninside. The young woman in the street replied by a single tap, and the\nshutter was opened a little way.\n\nIt may be judged whether d'Artagnan looked or listened with avidity.\nUnfortunately the light had been removed into another chamber; but the\neyes of the young man were accustomed to the night. Besides, the eyes of\nthe Gascons have, as it is asserted, like those of cats, the faculty of\nseeing in the dark.\n\nD'Artagnan then saw that the young woman took from her pocket a white\nobject, which she unfolded quickly, and which took the form of a\nhandkerchief. She made her interlocutor observe the corner of this\nunfolded object.\n\nThis immediately recalled to d'Artagnan's mind the handkerchief which he\nhad found at the feet of Mme. Bonacieux, which had reminded him of that\nwhich he had dragged from under the feet of Aramis.\n\n\"What the devil could that handkerchief signify?\"\n\nPlaced where he was, d'Artagnan could not perceive the face of Aramis.\nWe say Aramis, because the young man entertained no doubt that it was\nhis friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of\nthe exterior. Curiosity prevailed over prudence; and profiting by the\npreoccupation into which the sight of the handkerchief appeared to have\nplunged the two personages now on the scene, he stole from his hiding\nplace, and quick as lightning, but stepping with utmost caution, he ran\nand placed himself close to the angle of the wall, from which his eye\ncould pierce the interior of Aramis's room.\n\nUpon gaining this advantage d'Artagnan was near uttering a cry of\nsurprise; it was not Aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal\nvisitor, it was a woman! D'Artagnan, however, could only see enough\nto recognize the form of her vestments, not enough to distinguish her\nfeatures.\n\nAt the same instant the woman inside drew a second handkerchief from her\npocket, and exchanged it for that which had just been shown to her. Then\nsome words were spoken by the two women. At length the shutter closed.\nThe woman who was outside the window turned round, and passed within\nfour steps of d'Artagnan, pulling down the hood of her mantle; but\nthe precaution was too late, d'Artagnan had already recognized Mme.\nBonacieux.\n\nMme. Bonacieux! The suspicion that it was she had crossed the mind of\nd'Artagnan when she drew the handkerchief from her pocket; but what\nprobability was there that Mme. Bonacieux, who had sent for M. Laporte\nin order to be reconducted to the Louvre, should be running about the\nstreets of Paris at half past eleven at night, at the risk of being\nabducted a second time?\n\nThis must be, then, an affair of importance; and what is the most\nimportant affair to a woman of twenty-five! Love.\n\nBut was it on her own account, or on account of another, that she\nexposed herself to such hazards? This was a question the young man\nasked himself, whom the demon of jealousy already gnawed, being in heart\nneither more nor less than an accepted lover.\n\nThere was a very simple means of satisfying himself whither Mme.\nBonacieux was going; that was to follow her. This method was so simple\nthat d'Artagnan employed it quite naturally and instinctively.\n\nBut at the sight of the young man, who detached himself from the wall\nlike a statue walking from its niche, and at the noise of the steps\nwhich she heard resound behind her, Mme. Bonacieux uttered a little cry\nand fled.\n\nD'Artagnan ran after her. It was not difficult for him to overtake a\nwoman embarrassed with her cloak. He came up with her before she had\ntraversed a third of the street. The unfortunate woman was exhausted,\nnot by fatigue, but by terror, and when d'Artagnan placed his hand upon\nher shoulder, she sank upon one knee, crying in a choking voice, \"Kill\nme, if you please, you shall know nothing!\"\n\nD'Artagnan raised her by passing his arm round her waist; but as he\nfelt by her weight she was on the point of fainting, he made haste to\nreassure her by protestations of devotedness. These protestations were\nnothing for Mme. Bonacieux, for such protestations may be made with the\nworst intentions in the world; but the voice was all. Mme. Bonacieux\nthought she recognized the sound of that voice; she reopened her eyes,\ncast a quick glance upon the man who had terrified her so, and at once\nperceiving it was d'Artagnan, she uttered a cry of joy, \"Oh, it is you,\nit is you! Thank God, thank God!\"\n\n\"Yes, it is I,\" said d'Artagnan, \"it is I, whom God has sent to watch\nover you.\"\n\n\"Was it with that intention you followed me?\" asked the young woman,\nwith a coquettish smile, whose somewhat bantering character resumed its\ninfluence, and with whom all fear had disappeared from the moment in\nwhich she recognized a friend in one she had taken for an enemy.\n\n\"No,\" said d'Artagnan; \"no, I confess it. It was chance that threw me in\nyour way; I saw a woman knocking at the window of one of my friends.\"\n\n\"One of your friends?\" interrupted Mme. Bonacieux.\n\n\"Without doubt; Aramis is one of my best friends.\"\n\n\"Aramis! Who is he?\"\n\n\"Come, come, you won't tell me you don't know Aramis?\"\n\n\"This is the first time I ever heard his name pronounced.\"\n\n\"It is the first time, then, that you ever went to that house?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly.\"\n\n\"And you did not know that it was inhabited by a young man?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"By a Musketeer?\"\n\n\"No, indeed!\"\n\n\"It was not he, then, you came to seek?\"\n\n\"Not the least in the world. Besides, you must have seen that the person\nto whom I spoke was a woman.\"\n\n\"That is true; but this woman is a friend of Aramis--\"\n\n\"I know nothing of that.\"\n\n\"--since she lodges with him.\"\n\n\"That does not concern me.\"\n\n\"But who is she?\"\n\n\"Oh, that is not my secret.\"\n\n\"My dear Madame Bonacieux, you are charming; but at the same time you\nare one of the most mysterious women.\"\n\n\"Do I lose by that?\"\n\n\"No; you are, on the contrary, adorable.\"\n\n\"Give me your arm, then.\"\n\n\"Most willingly. And now?\"\n\n\"Now escort me.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Where I am going.\"\n\n\"But where are you going?\"\n\n\"You will see, because you will leave me at the door.\"\n\n\"Shall I wait for you?\"\n\n\"That will be useless.\"\n\n\"You will return alone, then?\"\n\n\"Perhaps yes, perhaps no.\"\n\n\"But will the person who shall accompany you afterward be a man or a\nwoman?\"\n\n\"I don't know yet.\"\n\n\"But I will know it!\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"I will wait until you come out.\"\n\n\"In that case, adieu.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"I do not want you.\"\n\n\"But you have claimed--\"\n\n\"The aid of a gentleman, not the watchfulness of a spy.\"\n\n\"The word is rather hard.\"\n\n\"How are they called who follow others in spite of them?\"\n\n\"They are indiscreet.\"\n\n\"The word is too mild.\"\n\n\"Well, madame, I perceive I must do as you wish.\"\n\n\"Why did you deprive yourself of the merit of doing so at once?\"\n\n\"Is there no merit in repentance?\"\n\n\"And do you really repent?\"\n\n\"I know nothing about it myself. But what I know is that I promise to do\nall you wish if you allow me to accompany you where you are going.\"\n\n\"And you will leave me then?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Without waiting for my coming out again?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Word of honor?\"\n\n\"By the faith of a gentleman. Take my arm, and let us go.\"\n\nD'Artagnan offered his arm to Mme. Bonacieux, who willingly took it,\nhalf laughing, half trembling, and both gained the top of Rue de la\nHarpe. Arriving there, the young woman seemed to hesitate, as she had\nbefore done in the Rue Vaugirard. She seemed, however, by certain signs,\nto recognize a door, and approaching that door, \"And now, monsieur,\"\nsaid she, \"it is here I have business; a thousand thanks for your\nhonorable company, which has saved me from all the dangers to which,\nalone I was exposed. But the moment is come to keep your word; I have\nreached my destination.\"\n\n\"And you will have nothing to fear on your return?\"\n\n\"I shall have nothing to fear but robbers.\"\n\n\"And that is nothing?\"\n\n\"What could they take from me? I have not a penny about me.\"\n\n\"You forget that beautiful handkerchief with the coat of arms.\"\n\n\"Which?\"\n\n\"That which I found at your feet, and replaced in your pocket.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, imprudent man! Do you wish to destroy me?\"\n\n\"You see very plainly that there is still danger for you, since a single\nword makes you tremble; and you confess that if that word were heard\nyou would be ruined. Come, come, madame!\" cried d'Artagnan, seizing her\nhands, and surveying her with an ardent glance, \"come, be more generous.\nConfide in me. Have you not read in my eyes that there is nothing but\ndevotion and sympathy in my heart?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Mme. Bonacieux; \"therefore, ask my own secrets, and I\nwill reveal them to you; but those of others--that is quite another\nthing.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said d'Artagnan, \"I shall discover them; as these secrets\nmay have an influence over your life, these secrets must become mine.\"\n\n\"Beware of what you do!\" cried the young woman, in a manner so serious\nas to make d'Artagnan start in spite of himself. \"Oh, meddle in\nnothing which concerns me. Do not seek to assist me in that which I am\naccomplishing. This I ask of you in the name of the interest with which\nI inspire you, in the name of the service you have rendered me and which\nI never shall forget while I have life. Rather, place faith in what I\ntell you. Have no more concern about me; I exist no longer for you, any\nmore than if you had never seen me.\"\n\n\"Must Aramis do as much as I, madame?\" said d'Artagnan, deeply piqued.\n\n\"This is the second or third time, monsieur, that you have repeated that\nname, and yet I have told you that I do not know him.\"\n\n\"You do not know the man at whose shutter you have just knocked? Indeed,\nmadame, you believe me too credulous!\"\n\n\"Confess that it is for the sake of making me talk that you invent this\nstory and create this personage.\"\n\n\"I invent nothing, madame; I create nothing. I only speak that exact\ntruth.\"\n\n\"And you say that one of your friends lives in that house?\"\n\n\"I say so, and I repeat it for the third time; that house is one\ninhabited by my friend, and that friend is Aramis.\"\n\n\"All this will be cleared up at a later period,\" murmured the young\nwoman; \"no, monsieur, be silent.\"\n\n\"If you could see my heart,\" said d'Artagnan, \"you would there read so\nmuch curiosity that you would pity me and so much love that you would\ninstantly satisfy my curiosity. We have nothing to fear from those who\nlove us.\"\n\n\"You speak very suddenly of love, monsieur,\" said the young woman,\nshaking her head.\n\n\"That is because love has come suddenly upon me, and for the first time;\nand because I am only twenty.\"\n\nThe young woman looked at him furtively.\n\n\"Listen; I am already upon the scent,\" resumed d'Artagnan. \"About\nthree months ago I was near having a duel with Aramis concerning\na handkerchief resembling the one you showed to the woman in his\nhouse--for a handkerchief marked in the same manner, I am sure.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the young woman, \"you weary me very much, I assure you,\nwith your questions.\"\n\n\"But you, madame, prudent as you are, think, if you were to be arrested\nwith that handkerchief, and that handkerchief were to be seized, would\nyou not be compromised?\"\n\n\"In what way? The initials are only mine--C. B., Constance Bonacieux.\"\n\n\"Or Camille de Bois-Tracy.\"\n\n\"Silence, monsieur! Once again, silence! Ah, since the dangers I incur\non my own account cannot stop you, think of those you may yourself run!\"\n\n\"Me?\"\n\n\"Yes; there is peril of imprisonment, risk of life in knowing me.\"\n\n\"Then I will not leave you.\"\n\n\"Monsieur!\" said the young woman, supplicating him and clasping her\nhands together, \"monsieur, in the name of heaven, by the honor of a\nsoldier, by the courtesy of a gentleman, depart! There, there midnight\nsounds! That is the hour when I am expected.\"\n\n\"Madame,\" said the young man, bowing; \"I can refuse nothing asked of me\nthus. Be content; I will depart.\"\n\n\"But you will not follow me; you will not watch me?\"\n\n\"I will return home instantly.\"\n\n\"Ah, I was quite sure you were a good and brave young man,\" said Mme.\nBonacieux, holding out her hand to him, and placing the other upon the\nknocker of a little door almost hidden in the wall.\n\nD'Artagnan seized the hand held out to him, and kissed it ardently.\n\n\"Ah! I wish I had never seen you!\" cried d'Artagnan, with that ingenuous\nroughness which women often prefer to the affectations of politeness,\nbecause it betrays the depths of the thought and proves that feeling\nprevails over reason.\n\n\"Well!\" resumed Mme. Bonacieux, in a voice almost caressing, and\npressing the hand of d'Artagnan, who had not relinquished hers, \"well:\nI will not say as much as you do; what is lost for today may not be lost\nforever. Who knows, when I shall be at liberty, that I may not satisfy\nyour curiosity?\"\n\n\"And will you make the same promise to my love?\" cried d'Artagnan,\nbeside himself with joy.\n\n\"Oh, as to that, I do not engage myself. That depends upon the\nsentiments with which you may inspire me.\"\n\n\"Then today, madame--\"\n\n\"Oh, today, I am no further than gratitude.\"\n\n\"Ah! You are too charming,\" said d'Artagnan, sorrowfully; \"and you abuse\nmy love.\"\n\n\"No, I use your generosity, that's all. But be of good cheer; with\ncertain people, everything comes round.\"\n\n\"Oh, you render me the happiest of men! Do not forget this evening--do\nnot forget that promise.\"\n\n\"Be satisfied. In the proper time and place I will remember everything.\nNow then, go, go, in the name of heaven! I was expected at sharp\nmidnight, and I am late.\"\n\n\"By five minutes.\"\n\n\"Yes; but in certain circumstances five minutes are five ages.\"\n\n\"When one loves.\"\n\n\"Well! And who told you I had no affair with a lover?\"\n\n\"It is a man, then, who expects you?\" cried d'Artagnan. \"A man!\"\n\n\"The discussion is going to begin again!\" said Mme. Bonacieux, with a\nhalf-smile which was not exempt from a tinge of impatience.\n\n\"No, no; I go, I depart! I believe in you, and I would have all the\nmerit of my devotion, even if that devotion were stupidity. Adieu,\nmadame, adieu!\"\n\nAnd as if he only felt strength to detach himself by a violent effort\nfrom the hand he held, he sprang away, running, while Mme. Bonacieux\nknocked, as at the shutter, three light and regular taps. When he had\ngained the angle of the street, he turned. The door had been opened, and\nshut again; the mercer's pretty wife had disappeared.\n\nD'Artagnan pursued his way. He had given his word not to watch Mme.\nBonacieux, and if his life had depended upon the spot to which she was\ngoing or upon the person who should accompany her, d'Artagnan would have\nreturned home, since he had so promised. Five minutes later he was in\nthe Rue des Fossoyeurs.\n\n\"Poor Athos!\" said he; \"he will never guess what all this means. He will\nhave fallen asleep waiting for me, or else he will have returned home,\nwhere he will have learned that a woman had been there. A woman with\nAthos! After all,\" continued d'Artagnan, \"there was certainly one with\nAramis. All this is very strange; and I am curious to know how it will\nend.\"\n\n\"Badly, monsieur, badly!\" replied a voice which the young man recognized\nas that of Planchet; for, soliloquizing aloud, as very preoccupied\npeople do, he had entered the alley, at the end of which were the stairs\nwhich led to his chamber.\n\n\"How badly? What do you mean by that, you idiot?\" asked d'Artagnan.\n\"What has happened?\"\n\n\"All sorts of misfortunes.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"In the first place, Monsieur Athos is arrested.\"\n\n\"Arrested! Athos arrested! What for?\"\n\n\"He was found in your lodging; they took him for you.\"\n\n\"And by whom was he arrested?\"\n\n\"By Guards brought by the men in black whom you put to flight.\"\n\n\"Why did he not tell them his name? Why did he not tell them he knew\nnothing about this affair?\"\n\n\"He took care not to do so, monsieur; on the contrary, he came up to me\nand said, 'It is your master that needs his liberty at this moment and\nnot I, since he knows everything and I know nothing. They will believe\nhe is arrested, and that will give him time; in three days I will tell\nthem who I am, and they cannot fail to let me go.'\"\n\n\"Bravo, Athos! Noble heart!\" murmured d'Artagnan. \"I know him well\nthere! And what did the officers do?\"\n\n\"Four conveyed him away, I don't know where--to the Bastille or Fort\nl'Eveque. Two remained with the men in black, who rummaged every place\nand took all the papers. The last two mounted guard at the door during\nthis examination; then, when all was over, they went away, leaving the\nhouse empty and exposed.\"\n\n\"And Porthos and Aramis?\"\n\n\"I could not find them; they did not come.\"\n\n\"But they may come any moment, for you left word that I awaited them?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Well, don't budge, then; if they come, tell them what has happened. Let\nthem wait for me at the Pomme-de-Pin. Here it would be dangerous; the\nhouse may be watched. I will run to Monsieur de Treville to tell them\nall this, and will meet them there.\"\n\n\"Very well, monsieur,\" said Planchet.\n\n\"But you will remain; you are not afraid?\" said d'Artagnan, coming back\nto recommend courage to his lackey.\n\n\"Be easy, monsieur,\" said Planchet; \"you do not know me yet. I am brave\nwhen I set about it. It is all in beginning. Besides, I am a Picard.\"\n\n\"Then it is understood,\" said d'Artagnan; \"you would rather be killed\nthan desert your post?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur; and there is nothing I would not do to prove to Monsieur\nthat I am attached to him.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said d'Artagnan to himself. \"It appears that the method I have\nadopted with this boy is decidedly the best. I shall use it again upon\noccasion.\"\n\nAnd with all the swiftness of his legs, already a little fatigued\nhowever, with the perambulations of the day, d'Artagnan directed his\ncourse toward M. de Treville's.\n\nM. de Treville was not at his hotel. His company was on guard at the\nLouvre; he was at the Louvre with his company.\n\nIt was necessary to reach M. de Treville; it was important that he\nshould be informed of what was passing. D'Artagnan resolved to try\nand enter the Louvre. His costume of Guardsman in the company of M.\nDessessart ought to be his passport.\n\nHe therefore went down the Rue des Petits Augustins, and came up to\nthe quay, in order to take the New Bridge. He had at first an idea of\ncrossing by the ferry; but on gaining the riverside, he had mechanically\nput his hand into his pocket, and perceived that he had not wherewithal\nto pay his passage.\n\nAs he gained the top of the Rue Guenegaud, he saw two persons coming out\nof the Rue Dauphine whose appearance very much struck him. Of the two\npersons who composed this group, one was a man and the other a woman.\nThe woman had the outline of Mme. Bonacieux; the man resembled Aramis so\nmuch as to be mistaken for him.\n\nBesides, the woman wore that black mantle which d'Artagnan could still\nsee outlined on the shutter of the Rue de Vaugirard and on the door\nof the Rue de la Harpe; still further, the man wore the uniform of a\nMusketeer.\n\nThe woman's hood was pulled down, and the man held a handkerchief to his\nface. Both, as this double precaution indicated, had an interest in not\nbeing recognized.\n\nThey took the bridge. That was d'Artagnan's road, as he was going to the\nLouvre. D'Artagnan followed them.\n\nHe had not gone twenty steps before he became convinced that the woman\nwas really Mme. Bonacieux and that the man was Aramis.\n\nHe felt at that instant all the suspicions of jealousy agitating his\nheart. He felt himself doubly betrayed, by his friend and by her whom\nhe already loved like a mistress. Mme. Bonacieux had declared to him,\nby all the gods, that she did not know Aramis; and a quarter of an hour\nafter having made this assertion, he found her hanging on the arm of\nAramis.\n\nD'Artagnan did not reflect that he had only known the mercer's pretty\nwife for three hours; that she owed him nothing but a little gratitude\nfor having delivered her from the men in black, who wished to carry her\noff, and that she had promised him nothing. He considered himself an\noutraged, betrayed, and ridiculed lover. Blood and anger mounted to his\nface; he was resolved to unravel the mystery.\n\nThe young man and young woman perceived they were watched, and redoubled\ntheir speed. D'Artagnan determined upon his course. He passed them, then\nreturned so as to meet them exactly before the Samaritaine. Which was\nilluminated by a lamp which threw its light over all that part of the\nbridge.\n\nD'Artagnan stopped before them, and they stopped before him.\n\n\"What do you want, monsieur?\" demanded the Musketeer, recoiling a\nstep, and with a foreign accent, which proved to d'Artagnan that he was\ndeceived in one of his conjectures.\n\n\"It is not Aramis!\" cried he.\n\n\"No, monsieur, it is not Aramis; and by your exclamation I perceive you\nhave mistaken me for another, and pardon you.\"\n\n\"You pardon me?\" cried d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the stranger. \"Allow me, then, to pass on, since it is\nnot with me you have anything to do.\"\n\n\"You are right, monsieur, it is not with you that I have anything to do;\nit is with Madame.\"\n\n\"With Madame! You do not know her,\" replied the stranger.\n\n\"You are deceived, monsieur; I know her very well.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Mme. Bonacieux; in a tone of reproach, \"ah, monsieur, I had\nyour promise as a soldier and your word as a gentleman. I hoped to be\nable to rely upon that.\"\n\n\"And I, madame!\" said d'Artagnan, embarrassed; \"you promised me--\"\n\n\"Take my arm, madame,\" said the stranger, \"and let us continue our way.\"\n\nD'Artagnan, however, stupefied, cast down, annihilated by all that\nhappened, stood, with crossed arms, before the Musketeer and Mme.\nBonacieux.\n\nThe Musketeer advanced two steps, and pushed d'Artagnan aside with his\nhand. D'Artagnan made a spring backward and drew his sword. At the same\ntime, and with the rapidity of lightning, the stranger drew his.\n\n\"In the name of heaven, my Lord!\" cried Mme. Bonacieux, throwing herself\nbetween the combatants and seizing the swords with her hands.\n\n\"My Lord!\" cried d'Artagnan, enlightened by a sudden idea, \"my Lord!\nPardon me, monsieur, but you are not--\"\n\n\"My Lord the Duke of Buckingham,\" said Mme. Bonacieux, in an undertone;\n\"and now you may ruin us all.\"\n\n\"My Lord, Madame, I ask a hundred pardons! But I love her, my Lord, and\nwas jealous. You know what it is to love, my Lord. Pardon me, and then\ntell me how I can risk my life to serve your Grace?\"\n\n\"You are a brave young man,\" said Buckingham, holding out his hand to\nd'Artagnan, who pressed it respectfully. \"You offer me your services;\nwith the same frankness I accept them. Follow us at a distance of twenty\npaces, as far as the Louvre, and if anyone watches us, slay him!\"\n\nD'Artagnan placed his naked sword under his arm, allowed the duke and\nMme. Bonacieux to take twenty steps ahead, and then followed them, ready\nto execute the instructions of the noble and elegant minister of Charles\nI.\n\nFortunately, he had no opportunity to give the duke this proof of his\ndevotion, and the young woman and the handsome Musketeer entered the\nLouvre by the wicket of the Echelle without any interference.\n\nAs for d'Artagnan, he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the\nPomme-de-Pin, where he found Porthos and Aramis awaiting him. Without\ngiving them any explanation of the alarm and inconvenience he had caused\nthem, he told them that he had terminated the affair alone in which he\nhad for a moment believed he should need their assistance.\n\nMeanwhile, carried away as we are by our narrative, we must leave our\nthree friends to themselves, and follow the Duke of Buckingham and his\nguide through the labyrinths of the Louvre.\n\n\n\n\n12 GEORGE VILLIERS, DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM\n\nMme. Bonacieux and the duke entered the Louvre without difficulty. Mme.\nBonacieux was known to belong to the queen; the duke wore the uniform\nof the Musketeers of M. de Treville, who, as we have said, were that\nevening on guard. Besides, Germain was in the interests of the queen;\nand if anything should happen, Mme. Bonacieux would be accused of having\nintroduced her lover into the Louvre, that was all. She took the risk\nupon herself. Her reputation would be lost, it is true; but of what\nvalue in the world was the reputation of the little wife of a mercer?\n\nOnce within the interior of the court, the duke and the young woman\nfollowed the wall for the space of about twenty-five steps. This space\npassed, Mme. Bonacieux pushed a little servants' door, open by day but\ngenerally closed at night. The door yielded. Both entered, and found\nthemselves in darkness; but Mme. Bonacieux was acquainted with all the\nturnings and windings of this part of the Louvre, appropriated for the\npeople of the household. She closed the door after her, took the duke by\nthe hand, and after a few experimental steps, grasped a balustrade, put\nher foot upon the bottom step, and began to ascend the staircase. The\nduke counted two stories. She then turned to the right, followed the\ncourse of a long corridor, descended a flight, went a few steps farther,\nintroduced a key into a lock, opened a door, and pushed the duke into\nan apartment lighted only by a lamp, saying, \"Remain here, my Lord\nDuke; someone will come.\" She then went out by the same door, which she\nlocked, so that the duke found himself literally a prisoner.\n\nNevertheless, isolated as he was, we must say that the Duke of\nBuckingham did not experience an instant of fear. One of the salient\npoints of his character was the search for adventures and a love of\nromance. Brave, rash, and enterprising, this was not the first time he\nhad risked his life in such attempts. He had learned that the pretended\nmessage from Anne of Austria, upon the faith of which he had come to\nParis, was a snare; but instead of regaining England, he had, abusing\nthe position in which he had been placed, declared to the queen that he\nwould not depart without seeing her. The queen had at first positively\nrefused; but at length became afraid that the duke, if exasperated,\nwould commit some folly. She had already decided upon seeing him and\nurging his immediate departure, when, on the very evening of coming to\nthis decision, Mme. Bonacieux, who was charged with going to fetch the\nduke and conducting him to the Louvre, was abducted. For two days no one\nknew what had become of her, and everything remained in suspense; but\nonce free, and placed in communication with Laporte, matters resumed\ntheir course, and she accomplished the perilous enterprise which, but\nfor her arrest, would have been executed three days earlier.\n\nBuckingham, left alone, walked toward a mirror. His Musketeer's uniform\nbecame him marvelously.\n\nAt thirty-five, which was then his age, he passed, with just title,\nfor the handsomest gentleman and the most elegant cavalier of France or\nEngland.\n\nThe favorite of two kings, immensely rich, all-powerful in a kingdom\nwhich he disordered at his fancy and calmed again at his caprice, George\nVilliers, Duke of Buckingham, had lived one of those fabulous existences\nwhich survive, in the course of centuries, to astonish posterity.\n\nSure of himself, convinced of his own power, certain that the laws which\nrule other men could not reach him, he went straight to the object he\naimed at, even were this object were so elevated and so dazzling that it\nwould have been madness for any other even to have contemplated it. It\nwas thus he had succeeded in approaching several times the beautiful and\nproud Anne of Austria, and in making himself loved by dazzling her.\n\nGeorge Villiers placed himself before the glass, as we have said,\nrestored the undulations to his beautiful hair, which the weight of his\nhat had disordered, twisted his mustache, and, his heart swelling with\njoy, happy and proud at being near the moment he had so long sighed for,\nhe smiled upon himself with pride and hope.\n\nAt this moment a door concealed in the tapestry opened, and a woman\nappeared. Buckingham saw this apparition in the glass; he uttered a cry.\nIt was the queen!\n\nAnne of Austria was then twenty-six or twenty-seven years of age; that\nis to say, she was in the full splendor of her beauty.\n\nHer carriage was that of a queen or a goddess; her eyes, which cast the\nbrilliancy of emeralds, were perfectly beautiful, and yet were at the\nsame time full of sweetness and majesty.\n\nHer mouth was small and rosy; and although her underlip, like that\nof all princes of the House of Austria, protruded slightly beyond\nthe other, it was eminently lovely in its smile, but as profoundly\ndisdainful in its contempt.\n\nHer skin was admired for its velvety softness; her hands and arms\nwere of surpassing beauty, all the poets of the time singing them as\nincomparable.\n\nLastly, her hair, which, from being light in her youth, had become\nchestnut, and which she wore curled very plainly, and with much powder,\nadmirably set off her face, in which the most rigid critic could only\nhave desired a little less rouge, and the most fastidious sculptor a\nlittle more fineness in the nose.\n\nBuckingham remained for a moment dazzled. Never had Anne of Austria\nappeared to him so beautiful, amid balls, fetes, or carousals, as she\nappeared to him at this moment, dressed in a simple robe of white satin,\nand accompanied by Donna Estafania--the only one of her Spanish women\nwho had not been driven from her by the jealousy of the king or by the\npersecutions of Richelieu.\n\nAnne of Austria took two steps forward. Buckingham threw himself at\nher feet, and before the queen could prevent him, kissed the hem of her\nrobe.\n\n\"Duke, you already know that it is not I who caused you to be written\nto.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, madame! Yes, your Majesty!\" cried the duke. \"I know that\nI must have been mad, senseless, to believe that snow would become\nanimated or marble warm; but what then! They who love believe easily in\nlove. Besides, I have lost nothing by this journey because I see you.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Anne, \"but you know why and how I see you; because,\ninsensible to all my sufferings, you persist in remaining in a city\nwhere, by remaining, you run the risk of your life, and make me run\nthe risk of my honor. I see you to tell you that everything separates\nus--the depths of the sea, the enmity of kingdoms, the sanctity of vows.\nIt is sacrilege to struggle against so many things, my Lord. In short, I\nsee you to tell you that we must never see each other again.\"\n\n\"Speak on, madame, speak on, Queen,\" said Buckingham; \"the sweetness of\nyour voice covers the harshness of your words. You talk of sacrilege!\nWhy, the sacrilege is the separation of two hearts formed by God for\neach other.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" cried the queen, \"you forget that I have never said that I\nlove you.\"\n\n\"But you have never told me that you did not love me; and truly, to\nspeak such words to me would be, on the part of your Majesty, too great\nan ingratitude. For tell me, where can you find a love like mine--a\nlove which neither time, nor absence, nor despair can extinguish, a\nlove which contents itself with a lost ribbon, a stray look, or a chance\nword? It is now three years, madame, since I saw you for the first time,\nand during those three years I have loved you thus. Shall I tell you\neach ornament of your toilet? Mark! I see you now. You were seated\nupon cushions in the Spanish fashion; you wore a robe of green satin\nembroidered with gold and silver, hanging sleeves knotted upon your\nbeautiful arms--those lovely arms--with large diamonds. You wore a close\nruff, a small cap upon your head of the same color as your robe, and in\nthat cap a heron's feather. Hold! Hold! I shut my eyes, and I can see\nyou as you then were; I open them again, and I see what you are now--a\nhundred time more beautiful!\"\n\n\"What folly,\" murmured Anne of Austria, who had not the courage to find\nfault with the duke for having so well preserved her portrait in his\nheart, \"what folly to feed a useless passion with such remembrances!\"\n\n\"And upon what then must I live? I have nothing but memory. It is my\nhappiness, my treasure, my hope. Every time I see you is a fresh diamond\nwhich I enclose in the casket of my heart. This is the fourth which you\nhave let fall and I have picked up; for in three years, madame, I have\nonly seen you four times--the first, which I have described to you; the\nsecond, at the mansion of Madame de Chevreuse; the third, in the gardens\nof Amiens.\"\n\n\"Duke,\" said the queen, blushing, \"never speak of that evening.\"\n\n\"Oh, let us speak of it; on the contrary, let us speak of it! That is\nthe most happy and brilliant evening of my life! You remember what a\nbeautiful night it was? How soft and perfumed was the air; how lovely\nthe blue heavens and star-enameled sky! Ah, then, madame, I was able\nfor one instant to be alone with you. Then you were about to tell me\nall--the isolation of your life, the griefs of your heart. You leaned\nupon my arm--upon this, madame! I felt, in bending my head toward you,\nyour beautiful hair touch my cheek; and every time that it touched me\nI trembled from head to foot. Oh, Queen! Queen! You do not know what\nfelicity from heaven, what joys from paradise, are comprised in a moment\nlike that. Take my wealth, my fortune, my glory, all the days I have\nto live, for such an instant, for a night like that. For that night,\nmadame, that night you loved me, I will swear it.\"\n\n\"My Lord, yes; it is possible that the influence of the place, the charm\nof the beautiful evening, the fascination of your look--the thousand\ncircumstances, in short, which sometimes unite to destroy a woman--were\ngrouped around me on that fatal evening; but, my Lord, you saw the queen\ncome to the aid of the woman who faltered. At the first word you dared\nto utter, at the first freedom to which I had to reply, I called for\nhelp.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, that is true. And any other love but mine would have sunk\nbeneath this ordeal; but my love came out from it more ardent and more\neternal. You believed that you would fly from me by returning to Paris;\nyou believed that I would not dare to quit the treasure over which my\nmaster had charged me to watch. What to me were all the treasures in\nthe world, or all the kings of the earth! Eight days after, I was back\nagain, madame. That time you had nothing to say to me; I had risked my\nlife and favor to see you but for a second. I did not even touch your\nhand, and you pardoned me on seeing me so submissive and so repentant.\"\n\n\"Yes, but calumny seized upon all those follies in which I took no part,\nas you well know, my Lord. The king, excited by the cardinal, made\na terrible clamor. Madame de Vernet was driven from me, Putange was\nexiled, Madame de Chevreuse fell into disgrace, and when you wished\nto come back as ambassador to France, the king himself--remember, my\nlord--the king himself opposed to it.\"\n\n\"Yes, and France is about to pay for her king's refusal with a war. I am\nnot allowed to see you, madame, but you shall every day hear of me. What\nobject, think you, have this expedition to Re and this league with the\nProtestants of La Rochelle which I am projecting? The pleasure of seeing\nyou. I have no hope of penetrating, sword in hand, to Paris, I know that\nwell. But this war may bring round a peace; this peace will require a\nnegotiator; that negotiator will be me. They will not dare to refuse me\nthen; and I will return to Paris, and will see you again, and will be\nhappy for an instant. Thousands of men, it is true, will have to pay for\nmy happiness with their lives; but what is that to me, provided I see\nyou again! All this is perhaps folly--perhaps insanity; but tell me what\nwoman has a lover more truly in love; what queen a servant more ardent?\"\n\n\"My Lord, my Lord, you invoke in your defense things which accuse you\nmore strongly. All these proofs of love which you would give me are\nalmost crimes.\"\n\n\"Because you do not love me, madame! If you loved me, you would view all\nthis otherwise. If you loved me, oh, if you loved me, that would be too\ngreat happiness, and I should run mad. Ah, Madame de Chevreuse was less\ncruel than you. Holland loved her, and she responded to his love.\"\n\n\"Madame de Chevreuse was not queen,\" murmured Anne of Austria, overcome,\nin spite of herself, by the expression of so profound a passion.\n\n\"You would love me, then, if you were not queen! Madame, say that you\nwould love me then! I can believe that it is the dignity of your rank\nalone which makes you cruel to me; I can believe that you had been\nMadame de Chevreuse, poor Buckingham might have hoped. Thanks for those\nsweet words! Oh, my beautiful sovereign, a hundred times, thanks!\"\n\n\"Oh, my Lord! You have ill understood, wrongly interpreted; I did not\nmean to say--\"\n\n\"Silence, silence!\" cried the duke. \"If I am happy in an error, do not\nhave the cruelty to lift me from it. You have told me yourself, madame,\nthat I have been drawn into a snare; I, perhaps, may leave my life\nin it--for, although it may be strange, I have for some time had a\npresentiment that I should shortly die.\" And the duke smiled, with a\nsmile at once sad and charming.\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" cried Anne of Austria, with an accent of terror which\nproved how much greater an interest she took in the duke than she\nventured to tell.\n\n\"I do not tell you this, madame, to terrify you; no, it is even\nridiculous for me to name it to you, and, believe me, I take no heed\nof such dreams. But the words you have just spoken, the hope you have\nalmost given me, will have richly paid all--were it my life.\"\n\n\"Oh, but I,\" said Anne, \"I also, duke, have had presentiments; I also\nhave had dreams. I dreamed that I saw you lying bleeding, wounded.\"\n\n\"In the left side, was it not, and with a knife?\" interrupted\nBuckingham.\n\n\"Yes, it was so, my Lord, it was so--in the left side, and with a knife.\nWho can possibly have told you I had had that dream? I have imparted it\nto no one but my God, and that in my prayers.\"\n\n\"I ask for no more. You love me, madame; it is enough.\"\n\n\"I love you, I?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. Would God send the same dreams to you as to me if you did not\nlove me? Should we have the same presentiments if our existences did not\ntouch at the heart? You love me, my beautiful queen, and you will weep\nfor me?\"\n\n\"Oh, my God, my God!\" cried Anne of Austria, \"this is more than I can\nbear. In the name of heaven, Duke, leave me, go! I do not know whether\nI love you or love you not; but what I know is that I will not be\nperjured. Take pity on me, then, and go! Oh, if you are struck in\nFrance, if you die in France, if I could imagine that your love for me\nwas the cause of your death, I could not console myself; I should run\nmad. Depart then, depart, I implore you!\"\n\n\"Oh, how beautiful you are thus! Oh, how I love you!\" said Buckingham.\n\n\"Go, go, I implore you, and return hereafter! Come back as ambassador,\ncome back as minister, come back surrounded with guards who will defend\nyou, with servants who will watch over you, and then I shall no longer\nfear for your days, and I shall be happy in seeing you.\"\n\n\"Oh, is this true what you say?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Oh, then, some pledge of your indulgence, some object which came from\nyou, and may remind me that I have not been dreaming; something you have\nworn, and that I may wear in my turn--a ring, a necklace, a chain.\"\n\n\"Will you depart--will you depart, if I give you that you demand?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"This very instant?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You will leave France, you will return to England?\"\n\n\"I will, I swear to you.\"\n\n\"Wait, then, wait.\"\n\nAnne of Austria re-entered her apartment, and came out again almost\nimmediately, holding a rosewood casket in her hand, with her cipher\nencrusted with gold.\n\n\"Here, my Lord, here,\" said she, \"keep this in memory of me.\"\n\nBuckingham took the casket, and fell a second time on his knees.\n\n\"You have promised me to go,\" said the queen.\n\n\"And I keep my word. Your hand, madame, your hand, and I depart!\"\n\nAnne of Austria stretched forth her hand, closing her eyes, and leaning\nwith the other upon Estafania, for she felt that her strength was about\nto fail her.\n\nBuckingham pressed his lips passionately to that beautiful hand, and\nthen rising, said, \"Within six months, if I am not dead, I shall have\nseen you again, madame--even if I have to overturn the world.\" And\nfaithful to the promise he had made, he rushed out of the apartment.\n\nIn the corridor he met Mme. Bonacieux, who waited for him, and who, with\nthe same precautions and the same good luck, conducted him out of the\nLouvre.\n\n\n\n\n13 MONSIEUR BONACIEUX\n\nThere was in all this, as may have been observed, one personage\nconcerned, of whom, notwithstanding his precarious position, we\nhave appeared to take but very little notice. This personage was M.\nBonacieux, the respectable martyr of the political and amorous intrigues\nwhich entangled themselves so nicely together at this gallant and\nchivalric period.\n\nFortunately, the reader may remember, or may not remember--fortunately\nwe have promised not to lose sight of him.\n\nThe officers who arrested him conducted him straight to the Bastille,\nwhere he passed trembling before a party of soldiers who were loading\ntheir muskets. Thence, introduced into a half-subterranean gallery,\nhe became, on the part of those who had brought him, the object of the\ngrossest insults and the harshest treatment. The officers perceived that\nthey had not to deal with a gentleman, and they treated him like a very\npeasant.\n\nAt the end of half an hour or thereabouts, a clerk came to put an end to\nhis tortures, but not to his anxiety, by giving the order to conduct\nM. Bonacieux to the Chamber of Examination. Ordinarily, prisoners were\ninterrogated in their cells; but they did not do so with M. Bonacieux.\n\nTwo guards attended the mercer who made him traverse a court and enter\na corridor in which were three sentinels, opened a door and pushed him\nunceremoniously into a low room, where the only furniture was a table, a\nchair, and a commissary. The commissary was seated in the chair, and was\nwriting at the table.\n\nThe two guards led the prisoner toward the table, and upon a sign from\nthe commissary drew back so far as to be unable to hear anything.\n\nThe commissary, who had till this time held his head down over his\npapers, looked up to see what sort of person he had to do with. This\ncommissary was a man of very repulsive mien, with a pointed nose,\nwith yellow and salient cheek bones, with eyes small but keen and\npenetrating, and an expression of countenance resembling at once the\npolecat and the fox. His head, supported by a long and flexible neck,\nissued from his large black robe, balancing itself with a motion very\nmuch like that of the tortoise thrusting his head out of his shell. He\nbegan by asking M. Bonacieux his name, age, condition, and abode.\n\nThe accused replied that his name was Jacques Michel Bonacieux, that he\nwas fifty-one years old, a retired mercer, and lived Rue des Fossoyeurs,\nNo. 14.\n\nThe commissary then, instead of continuing to interrogate him, made him\na long speech upon the danger there is for an obscure citizen to meddle\nwith public matters. He complicated this exordium by an exposition\nin which he painted the power and the deeds of the cardinal, that\nincomparable minister, that conqueror of past ministers, that example\nfor ministers to come--deeds and power which none could thwart with\nimpunity.\n\nAfter this second part of his discourse, fixing his hawk's eye upon poor\nBonacieux, he bade him reflect upon the gravity of his situation.\n\nThe reflections of the mercer were already made; he cursed the instant\nwhen M. Laporte formed the idea of marrying him to his goddaughter, and\nparticularly the moment when that goddaughter had been received as Lady\nof the Linen to her Majesty.\n\nAt bottom the character of M. Bonacieux was one of profound selfishness\nmixed with sordid avarice, the whole seasoned with extreme cowardice.\nThe love with which his young wife had inspired him was a secondary\nsentiment, and was not strong enough to contend with the primitive\nfeelings we have just enumerated. Bonacieux indeed reflected on what had\njust been said to him.\n\n\"But, Monsieur Commissary,\" said he, calmly, \"believe that I know and\nappreciate, more than anybody, the merit of the incomparable eminence by\nwhom we have the honor to be governed.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" asked the commissary, with an air of doubt. \"If that is really\nso, how came you in the Bastille?\"\n\n\"How I came there, or rather why I am there,\" replied Bonacieux, \"that\nis entirely impossible for me to tell you, because I don't know myself;\nbut to a certainty it is not for having, knowingly at least, disobliged\nMonsieur the Cardinal.\"\n\n\"You must, nevertheless, have committed a crime, since you are here and\nare accused of high treason.\"\n\n\"Of high treason!\" cried Bonacieux, terrified; \"of high treason! How\nis it possible for a poor mercer, who detests Huguenots and who abhors\nSpaniards, to be accused of high treason? Consider, monsieur, the thing\nis absolutely impossible.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Bonacieux,\" said the commissary, looking at the accused as if\nhis little eyes had the faculty of reading to the very depths of hearts,\n\"you have a wife?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" replied the mercer, in a tremble, feeling that it was\nat this point affairs were likely to become perplexing; \"that is to say,\nI HAD one.\"\n\n\"What, you 'had one'? What have you done with her, then, if you have her\nno longer?\"\n\n\"They have abducted her, monsieur.\"\n\n\"They have abducted her? Ah!\"\n\nBonacieux inferred from this \"Ah\" that the affair grew more and more\nintricate.\n\n\"They have abducted her,\" added the commissary; \"and do you know the man\nwho has committed this deed?\"\n\n\"I think I know him.\"\n\n\"Who is he?\"\n\n\"Remember that I affirm nothing, Monsieur the Commissary, and that I\nonly suspect.\"\n\n\"Whom do you suspect? Come, answer freely.\"\n\nM. Bonacieux was in the greatest perplexity possible. Had he better deny\neverything or tell everything? By denying all, it might be suspected\nthat he must know too much to avow; by confessing all he might prove his\ngood will. He decided, then, to tell all.\n\n\"I suspect,\" said he, \"a tall, dark man, of lofty carriage, who has the\nair of a great lord. He has followed us several times, as I think, when\nI have waited for my wife at the wicket of the Louvre to escort her\nhome.\"\n\nThe commissary now appeared to experience a little uneasiness.\n\n\"And his name?\" said he.\n\n\"Oh, as to his name, I know nothing about it; but if I were ever to meet\nhim, I should recognize him in an instant, I will answer for it, were he\namong a thousand persons.\"\n\nThe face of the commissary grew still darker.\n\n\"You should recognize him among a thousand, say you?\" continued he.\n\n\"That is to say,\" cried Bonacieux, who saw he had taken a false step,\n\"that is to say--\"\n\n\"You have answered that you should recognize him,\" said the commissary.\n\"That is all very well, and enough for today; before we proceed further,\nsomeone must be informed that you know the ravisher of your wife.\"\n\n\"But I have not told you that I know him!\" cried Bonacieux, in despair.\n\"I told you, on the contrary--\"\n\n\"Take away the prisoner,\" said the commissary to the two guards.\n\n\"Where must we place him?\" demanded the chief.\n\n\"In a dungeon.\"\n\n\"Which?\"\n\n\"Good Lord! In the first one handy, provided it is safe,\" said the\ncommissary, with an indifference which penetrated poor Bonacieux with\nhorror.\n\n\"Alas, alas!\" said he to himself, \"misfortune is over my head; my\nwife must have committed some frightful crime. They believe me her\naccomplice, and will punish me with her. She must have spoken; she must\nhave confessed everything--a woman is so weak! A dungeon! The first he\ncomes to! That's it! A night is soon passed; and tomorrow to the wheel,\nto the gallows! Oh, my God, my God, have pity on me!\"\n\nWithout listening the least in the world to the lamentations of M.\nBonacieux--lamentations to which, besides, they must have been pretty\nwell accustomed--the two guards took the prisoner each by an arm,\nand led him away, while the commissary wrote a letter in haste and\ndispatched it by an officer in waiting.\n\nBonacieux could not close his eyes; not because his dungeon was so very\ndisagreeable, but because his uneasiness was so great. He sat all night\non his stool, starting at the least noise; and when the first rays of\nthe sun penetrated into his chamber, the dawn itself appeared to him to\nhave taken funereal tints.\n\nAll at once he heard his bolts drawn, and made a terrified bound. He\nbelieved they were come to conduct him to the scaffold; so that when he\nsaw merely and simply, instead of the executioner he expected, only his\ncommissary of the preceding evening, attended by his clerk, he was ready\nto embrace them both.\n\n\"Your affair has become more complicated since yesterday evening, my\ngood man, and I advise you to tell the whole truth; for your repentance\nalone can remove the anger of the cardinal.\"\n\n\"Why, I am ready to tell everything,\" cried Bonacieux, \"at least, all\nthat I know. Interrogate me, I entreat you!\"\n\n\"Where is your wife, in the first place?\"\n\n\"Why, did not I tell you she had been stolen from me?\"\n\n\"Yes, but yesterday at five o'clock in the afternoon, thanks to you, she\nescaped.\"\n\n\"My wife escaped!\" cried Bonacieux. \"Oh, unfortunate creature! Monsieur,\nif she has escaped, it is not my fault, I swear.\"\n\n\"What business had you, then, to go into the chamber of Monsieur\nd'Artagnan, your neighbor, with whom you had a long conference during\nthe day?\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, Monsieur Commissary; yes, that is true, and I confess that I\nwas in the wrong. I did go to Monsieur d'Artagnan's.\"\n\n\"What was the aim of that visit?\"\n\n\"To beg him to assist me in finding my wife. I believed I had a right\nto endeavor to find her. I was deceived, as it appears, and I ask your\npardon.\"\n\n\"And what did Monsieur d'Artagnan reply?\"\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan promised me his assistance; but I soon found out\nthat he was betraying me.\"\n\n\"You impose upon justice. Monsieur d'Artagnan made a compact with you;\nand in virtue of that compact put to flight the police who had arrested\nyour wife, and has placed her beyond reach.\"\n\n\"Fortunately, Monsieur d'Artagnan is in our hands, and you shall be\nconfronted with him.\"\n\n\"By my faith, I ask no better,\" cried Bonacieux; \"I shall not be sorry\nto see the face of an acquaintance.\"\n\n\"Bring in the Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said the commissary to the guards.\nThe two guards led in Athos.\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said the commissary, addressing Athos, \"declare\nall that passed yesterday between you and Monsieur.\"\n\n\"But,\" cried Bonacieux, \"this is not Monsieur d'Artagnan whom you show\nme.\"\n\n\"What! Not Monsieur d'Artagnan?\" exclaimed the commissary.\n\n\"Not the least in the world,\" replied Bonacieux.\n\n\"What is this gentleman's name?\" asked the commissary.\n\n\"I cannot tell you; I don't know him.\"\n\n\"How! You don't know him?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Did you never see him?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have seen him, but I don't know what he calls himself.\"\n\n\"Your name?\" replied the commissary.\n\n\"Athos,\" replied the Musketeer.\n\n\"But that is not a man's name; that is the name of a mountain,\" cried\nthe poor questioner, who began to lose his head.\n\n\"That is my name,\" said Athos, quietly.\n\n\"But you said that your name was d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Who, I?\"\n\n\"Yes, you.\"\n\n\"Somebody said to me, 'You are Monsieur d'Artagnan?' I answered, 'You\nthink so?' My guards exclaimed that they were sure of it. I did not wish\nto contradict them; besides, I might be deceived.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, you insult the majesty of justice.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Athos, calmly.\n\n\"You are Monsieur d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"You see, monsieur, that you say it again.\"\n\n\"But I tell you, Monsieur Commissary,\" cried Bonacieux, in his turn,\n\"there is not the least doubt about the matter. Monsieur d'Artagnan is\nmy tenant, although he does not pay me my rent--and even better on\nthat account ought I to know him. Monsieur d'Artagnan is a young man,\nscarcely nineteen or twenty, and this gentleman must be thirty at\nleast. Monsieur d'Artagnan is in Monsieur Dessessart's Guards, and this\ngentleman is in the company of Monsieur de Treville's Musketeers. Look\nat his uniform, Monsieur Commissary, look at his uniform!\"\n\n\"That's true,\" murmured the commissary; \"PARDIEU, that's true.\"\n\nAt this moment the door was opened quickly, and a messenger, introduced\nby one of the gatekeepers of the Bastille, gave a letter to the\ncommissary.\n\n\"Oh, unhappy woman!\" cried the commissary.\n\n\"How? What do you say? Of whom do you speak? It is not of my wife, I\nhope!\"\n\n\"On the contrary, it is of her. Yours is a pretty business.\"\n\n\"But,\" said the agitated mercer, \"do me the pleasure, monsieur, to tell\nme how my own proper affair can become worse by anything my wife does\nwhile I am in prison?\"\n\n\"Because that which she does is part of a plan concerted between you--of\nan infernal plan.\"\n\n\"I swear to you, Monsieur Commissary, that you are in the profoundest\nerror, that I know nothing in the world about what my wife had to do,\nthat I am entirely a stranger to what she has done; and that if she has\ncommitted any follies, I renounce her, I abjure her, I curse her!\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said Athos to the commissary, \"if you have no more need of me,\nsend me somewhere. Your Monsieur Bonacieux is very tiresome.\"\n\nThe commissary designated by the same gesture Athos and Bonacieux, \"Let\nthem be guarded more closely than ever.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" said Athos, with his habitual calmness, \"if it be Monsieur\nd'Artagnan who is concerned in this matter, I do not perceive how I can\ntake his place.\"\n\n\"Do as I bade you,\" cried the commissary, \"and preserve absolute\nsecrecy. You understand!\"\n\nAthos shrugged his shoulders, and followed his guards silently, while M.\nBonacieux uttered lamentations enough to break the heart of a tiger.\n\nThey locked the mercer in the same dungeon where he had passed the\nnight, and left him to himself during the day. Bonacieux wept all day,\nlike a true mercer, not being at all a military man, as he himself\ninformed us. In the evening, about nine o'clock, at the moment he had\nmade up his mind to go to bed, he heard steps in his corridor. These\nsteps drew near to his dungeon, the door was thrown open, and the guards\nappeared.\n\n\"Follow me,\" said an officer, who came up behind the guards.\n\n\"Follow you!\" cried Bonacieux, \"follow you at this hour! Where, my God?\"\n\n\"Where we have orders to lead you.\"\n\n\"But that is not an answer.\"\n\n\"It is, nevertheless, the only one we can give.\"\n\n\"Ah, my God, my God!\" murmured the poor mercer, \"now, indeed, I am\nlost!\" And he followed the guards who came for him, mechanically and\nwithout resistance.\n\nHe passed along the same corridor as before, crossed one court, then a\nsecond side of a building; at length, at the gate of the entrance court\nhe found a carriage surrounded by four guards on horseback. They made\nhim enter this carriage, the officer placed himself by his side, the\ndoor was locked, and they were left in a rolling prison. The carriage\nwas put in motion as slowly as a funeral car. Through the closely\nfastened windows the prisoner could perceive the houses and the\npavement, that was all; but, true Parisian as he was, Bonacieux could\nrecognize every street by the milestones, the signs, and the lamps.\nAt the moment of arriving at St. Paul--the spot where such as were\ncondemned at the Bastille were executed--he was near fainting and\ncrossed himself twice. He thought the carriage was about to stop there.\nThe carriage, however, passed on.\n\nFarther on, a still greater terror seized him on passing by the cemetery\nof St. Jean, where state criminals were buried. One thing, however,\nreassured him; he remembered that before they were buried their heads\nwere generally cut off, and he felt that his head was still on his\nshoulders. But when he saw the carriage take the way to La Greve, when\nhe perceived the pointed roof of the Hotel de Ville, and the carriage\npassed under the arcade, he believed it was over with him. He wished\nto confess to the officer, and upon his refusal, uttered such pitiable\ncries that the officer told him that if he continued to deafen him thus,\nhe should put a gag in his mouth.\n\nThis measure somewhat reassured Bonacieux. If they meant to execute him\nat La Greve, it could scarcely be worth while to gag him, as they had\nnearly reached the place of execution. Indeed, the carriage crossed the\nfatal spot without stopping. There remained, then, no other place to\nfear but the Traitor's Cross; the carriage was taking the direct road to\nit.\n\nThis time there was no longer any doubt; it was at the Traitor's Cross\nthat lesser criminals were executed. Bonacieux had flattered himself in\nbelieving himself worthy of St. Paul or of the Place de Greve; it was at\nthe Traitor's Cross that his journey and his destiny were about to end!\nHe could not yet see that dreadful cross, but he felt somehow as if it\nwere coming to meet him. When he was within twenty paces of it, he heard\na noise of people and the carriage stopped. This was more than poor\nBonacieux could endure, depressed as he was by the successive emotions\nwhich he had experienced; he uttered a feeble groan which night have\nbeen taken for the last sigh of a dying man, and fainted.\n\n\n\n\n14 THE MAN OF MEUNG\n\nThe crowd was caused, not by the expectation of a man to be hanged, but\nby the contemplation of a man who was hanged.\n\nThe carriage, which had been stopped for a minute, resumed its way,\npassed through the crowd, threaded the Rue St. Honore, turned into the\nRue des Bons Enfants, and stopped before a low door.\n\nThe door opened; two guards received Bonacieux in their arms from the\nofficer who supported him. They carried him through an alley, up a\nflight of stairs, and deposited him in an antechamber.\n\nAll these movements had been effected mechanically, as far as he was\nconcerned. He had walked as one walks in a dream; he had a glimpse\nof objects as through a fog. His ears had perceived sounds without\ncomprehending them; he might have been executed at that moment without\nhis making a single gesture in his own defense or uttering a cry to\nimplore mercy.\n\nHe remained on the bench, with his back leaning against the wall and his\nhands hanging down, exactly on the spot where the guards placed him.\n\nOn looking around him, however, as he could perceive no threatening\nobject, as nothing indicated that he ran any real danger, as the bench\nwas comfortably covered with a well-stuffed cushion, as the wall was\nornamented with a beautiful Cordova leather, and as large red damask\ncurtains, fastened back by gold clasps, floated before the window, he\nperceived by degrees that his fear was exaggerated, and he began to turn\nhis head to the right and the left, upward and downward.\n\nAt this movement, which nobody opposed, he resumed a little courage, and\nventured to draw up one leg and then the other. At length, with the help\nof his two hands he lifted himself from the bench, and found himself on\nhis feet.\n\nAt this moment an officer with a pleasant face opened a door, continued\nto exchange some words with a person in the next chamber and then came\nup to the prisoner. \"Is your name Bonacieux?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur Officer,\" stammered the mercer, more dead than alive, \"at\nyour service.\"\n\n\"Come in,\" said the officer.\n\nAnd he moved out of the way to let the mercer pass. The latter obeyed\nwithout reply, and entered the chamber, where he appeared to be\nexpected.\n\nIt was a large cabinet, close and stifling, with the walls furnished\nwith arms offensive and defensive, and in which there was already a\nfire, although it was scarcely the end of the month of September. A\nsquare table, covered with books and papers, upon which was unrolled\nan immense plan of the city of La Rochelle, occupied the center of the\nroom.\n\nStanding before the chimney was a man of middle height, of a haughty,\nproud mien; with piercing eyes, a large brow, and a thin face, which\nwas made still longer by a ROYAL (or IMPERIAL, as it is now called),\nsurmounted by a pair of mustaches. Although this man was scarcely\nthirty-six or thirty-seven years of age, hair, mustaches, and royal, all\nbegan to be gray. This man, except a sword, had all the appearance of a\nsoldier; and his buff boots still slightly covered with dust, indicated\nthat he had been on horseback in the course of the day.\n\nThis man was Armand Jean Duplessis, Cardinal de Richelieu; not such as\nhe is now represented--broken down like an old man, suffering like a\nmartyr, his body bent, his voice failing, buried in a large armchair\nas in an anticipated tomb; no longer living but by the strength of his\ngenius, and no longer maintaining the struggle with Europe but by the\neternal application of his thoughts--but such as he really was at this\nperiod; that is to say, an active and gallant cavalier, already weak\nof body, but sustained by that moral power which made of him one of\nthe most extraordinary men that ever lived, preparing, after having\nsupported the Duc de Nevers in his duchy of Mantua, after having taken\nNimes, Castres, and Uzes, to drive the English from the Isle of Re and\nlay siege to La Rochelle.\n\nAt first sight, nothing denoted the cardinal; and it was impossible for\nthose who did not know his face to guess in whose presence they were.\n\nThe poor mercer remained standing at the door, while the eyes of the\npersonage we have just described were fixed upon him, and appeared to\nwish to penetrate even into the depths of the past.\n\n\"Is this that Bonacieux?\" asked he, after a moment of silence.\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur,\" replied the officer.\n\n\"That's well. Give me those papers, and leave us.\"\n\nThe officer took from the table the papers pointed out, gave them to him\nwho asked for them, bowed to the ground, and retired.\n\nBonacieux recognized in these papers his interrogatories of the\nBastille. From time to time the man by the chimney raised his eyes from\nthe writings, and plunged them like poniards into the heart of the poor\nmercer.\n\nAt the end of ten minutes of reading and ten seconds of examination, the\ncardinal was satisfied.\n\n\"That head has never conspired,\" murmured he, \"but it matters not; we\nwill see.\"\n\n\"You are accused of high treason,\" said the cardinal, slowly.\n\n\"So I have been told already, monseigneur,\" cried Bonacieux, giving his\ninterrogator the title he had heard the officer give him, \"but I swear\nto you that I know nothing about it.\"\n\nThe cardinal repressed a smile.\n\n\"You have conspired with your wife, with Madame de Chevreuse, and with\nmy Lord Duke of Buckingham.\"\n\n\"Indeed, monseigneur,\" responded the mercer, \"I have heard her pronounce\nall those names.\"\n\n\"And on what occasion?\"\n\n\"She said that the Cardinal de Richelieu had drawn the Duke of\nBuckingham to Paris to ruin him and to ruin the queen.\"\n\n\"She said that?\" cried the cardinal, with violence.\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur, but I told her she was wrong to talk about such\nthings; and that his Eminence was incapable--\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue! You are stupid,\" replied the cardinal.\n\n\"That's exactly what my wife said, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"Do you know who carried off your wife?\"\n\n\"No, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"You have suspicions, nevertheless?\"\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur; but these suspicions appeared to be disagreeable to\nMonsieur the Commissary, and I no longer have them.\"\n\n\"Your wife has escaped. Did you know that?\"\n\n\"No, monseigneur. I learned it since I have been in prison, and that\nfrom the conversation of Monsieur the Commissary--an amiable man.\"\n\nThe cardinal repressed another smile.\n\n\"Then you are ignorant of what has become of your wife since her\nflight.\"\n\n\"Absolutely, monseigneur; but she has most likely returned to the\nLouvre.\"\n\n\"At one o'clock this morning she had not returned.\"\n\n\"My God! What can have become of her, then?\"\n\n\"We shall know, be assured. Nothing is concealed from the cardinal; the\ncardinal knows everything.\"\n\n\"In that case, monseigneur, do you believe the cardinal will be so kind\nas to tell me what has become of my wife?\"\n\n\"Perhaps he may; but you must, in the first place, reveal to the\ncardinal all you know of your wife's relations with Madame de\nChevreuse.\"\n\n\"But, monseigneur, I know nothing about them; I have never seen her.\"\n\n\"When you went to fetch your wife from the Louvre, did you always return\ndirectly home?\"\n\n\"Scarcely ever; she had business to transact with linen drapers, to\nwhose houses I conducted her.\"\n\n\"And how many were there of these linen drapers?\"\n\n\"Two, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"And where did they live?\"\n\n\"One in Rue de Vaugirard, the other Rue de la Harpe.\"\n\n\"Did you go into these houses with her?\"\n\n\"Never, monseigneur; I waited at the door.\"\n\n\"And what excuse did she give you for entering all alone?\"\n\n\"She gave me none; she told me to wait, and I waited.\"\n\n\"You are a very complacent husband, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux,\" said\nthe cardinal.\n\n\"He calls me his dear Monsieur,\" said the mercer to himself. \"PESTE!\nMatters are going all right.\"\n\n\"Should you know those doors again?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do you know the numbers?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What are they?\"\n\n\"No. 25 in the Rue de Vaugirard; 75 in the Rue de la Harpe.\"\n\n\"That's well,\" said the cardinal.\n\nAt these words he took up a silver bell, and rang it; the officer\nentered.\n\n\"Go,\" said he, in a subdued voice, \"and find Rochefort. Tell him to come\nto me immediately, if he has returned.\"\n\n\"The count is here,\" said the officer, \"and requests to speak with your\nEminence instantly.\"\n\n\"Let him come in, then!\" said the cardinal, quickly.\n\nThe officer sprang out of the apartment with that alacrity which all the\nservants of the cardinal displayed in obeying him.\n\n\"To your Eminence!\" murmured Bonacieux, rolling his eyes round in\nastonishment.\n\nFive seconds has scarcely elapsed after the disappearance of the\nofficer, when the door opened, and a new personage entered.\n\n\"It is he!\" cried Bonacieux.\n\n\"He! What he?\" asked the cardinal.\n\n\"The man who abducted my wife.\"\n\nThe cardinal rang a second time. The officer reappeared.\n\n\"Place this man in the care of his guards again, and let him wait till I\nsend for him.\"\n\n\"No, monseigneur, no, it is not he!\" cried Bonacieux; \"no, I was\ndeceived. This is quite another man, and does not resemble him at all.\nMonsieur is, I am sure, an honest man.\"\n\n\"Take away that fool!\" said the cardinal.\n\nThe officer took Bonacieux by the arm, and led him into the antechamber,\nwhere he found his two guards.\n\nThe newly introduced personage followed Bonacieux impatiently with his\neyes till he had gone out; and the moment the door closed, \"They have\nseen each other;\" said he, approaching the cardinal eagerly.\n\n\"Who?\" asked his Eminence.\n\n\"He and she.\"\n\n\"The queen and the duke?\" cried Richelieu.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"At the Louvre.\"\n\n\"Are you sure of it?\"\n\n\"Perfectly sure.\"\n\n\"Who told you of it?\"\n\n\"Madame de Lannoy, who is devoted to your Eminence, as you know.\"\n\n\"Why did she not let me know sooner?\"\n\n\"Whether by chance or mistrust, the queen made Madame de Surgis sleep in\nher chamber, and detained her all day.\"\n\n\"Well, we are beaten! Now let us try to take our revenge.\"\n\n\"I will assist you with all my heart, monseigneur; be assured of that.\"\n\n\"How did it come about?\"\n\n\"At half past twelve the queen was with her women--\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"In her bedchamber--\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"When someone came and brought her a handkerchief from her laundress.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"The queen immediately exhibited strong emotion; and despite the rouge\nwith which her face was covered evidently turned pale--\"\n\n\"And then, and then?\"\n\n\"She then arose, and with altered voice, 'Ladies,' said she, 'wait for\nme ten minutes, I shall soon return.' She then opened the door of her\nalcove, and went out.\"\n\n\"Why did not Madame de Lannoy come and inform you instantly?\"\n\n\"Nothing was certain; besides, her Majesty had said, 'Ladies, wait for\nme,' and she did not dare to disobey the queen.\"\n\n\"How long did the queen remain out of the chamber?\"\n\n\"Three-quarters of an hour.\"\n\n\"None of her women accompanied her?\"\n\n\"Only Donna Estafania.\"\n\n\"Did she afterward return?\"\n\n\"Yes; but only to take a little rosewood casket, with her cipher upon\nit, and went out again immediately.\"\n\n\"And when she finally returned, did she bring that casket with her?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Does Madame de Lannoy know what was in that casket?\"\n\n\"Yes; the diamond studs which his Majesty gave the queen.\"\n\n\"And she came back without this casket?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Madame de Lannoy, then, is of opinion that she gave them to\nBuckingham?\"\n\n\"She is sure of it.\"\n\n\"How can she be so?\"\n\n\"In the course of the day Madame de Lannoy, in her quality of tire-woman\nof the queen, looked for this casket, appeared uneasy at not finding it,\nand at length asked information of the queen.\"\n\n\"And then the queen?\"\n\n\"The queen became exceedingly red, and replied that having in the\nevening broken one of those studs, she had sent it to her goldsmith to\nbe repaired.\"\n\n\"He must be called upon, and so ascertain if the thing be true or not.\"\n\n\"I have just been with him.\"\n\n\"And the goldsmith?\"\n\n\"The goldsmith has heard nothing of it.\"\n\n\"Well, well! Rochefort, all is not lost; and perhaps--perhaps everything\nis for the best.\"\n\n\"The fact is that I do not doubt your Eminence's genius--\"\n\n\"Will repair the blunders of his agent--is that it?\"\n\n\"That is exactly what I was going to say, if your Eminence had let me\nfinish my sentence.\"\n\n\"Meanwhile, do you know where the Duchesse de Chevreuse and the Duke of\nBuckingham are now concealed?\"\n\n\"No, monseigneur; my people could tell me nothing on that head.\"\n\n\"But I know.\"\n\n\"You, monseigneur?\"\n\n\"Yes; or at least I guess. They were, one in the Rue de Vaugirard, No.\n25; the other in the Rue de la Harpe, No. 75.\"\n\n\"Does your Eminence command that they both be instantly arrested?\"\n\n\"It will be too late; they will be gone.\"\n\n\"But still, we can make sure that they are so.\"\n\n\"Take ten men of my Guardsmen, and search the two houses thoroughly.\"\n\n\"Instantly, monseigneur.\" And Rochefort went hastily out of the\napartment.\n\nThe cardinal being left alone, reflected for an instant and then rang\nthe bell a third time. The same officer appeared.\n\n\"Bring the prisoner in again,\" said the cardinal.\n\nM. Bonacieux was introduced afresh, and upon a sign from the cardinal,\nthe officer retired.\n\n\"You have deceived me!\" said the cardinal, sternly.\n\n\"I,\" cried Bonacieux, \"I deceive your Eminence!\"\n\n\"Your wife, in going to Rue de Vaugirard and Rue de la Harpe, did not go\nto find linen drapers.\"\n\n\"Then why did she go, just God?\"\n\n\"She went to meet the Duchesse de Chevreuse and the Duke of Buckingham.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" cried Bonacieux, recalling all his remembrances of the\ncircumstances, \"yes, that's it. Your Eminence is right. I told my wife\nseveral times that it was surprising that linen drapers should live\nin such houses as those, in houses that had no signs; but she always\nlaughed at me. Ah, monseigneur!\" continued Bonacieux, throwing himself\nat his Eminence's feet, \"ah, how truly you are the cardinal, the great\ncardinal, the man of genius whom all the world reveres!\"\n\nThe cardinal, however contemptible might be the triumph gained over so\nvulgar a being as Bonacieux, did not the less enjoy it for an instant;\nthen, almost immediately, as if a fresh thought has occurred, a smile\nplayed upon his lips, and he said, offering his hand to the mercer,\n\"Rise, my friend, you are a worthy man.\"\n\n\"The cardinal has touched me with his hand! I have touched the hand\nof the great man!\" cried Bonacieux. \"The great man has called me his\nfriend!\"\n\n\"Yes, my friend, yes,\" said the cardinal, with that paternal tone which\nhe sometimes knew how to assume, but which deceived none who knew him;\n\"and as you have been unjustly suspected, well, you must be indemnified.\nHere, take this purse of a hundred pistoles, and pardon me.\"\n\n\"I pardon you, monseigneur!\" said Bonacieux, hesitating to take\nthe purse, fearing, doubtless, that this pretended gift was but a\npleasantry. \"But you are able to have me arrested, you are able to have\nme tortured, you are able to have me hanged; you are the master, and\nI could not have the least word to say. Pardon you, monseigneur! You\ncannot mean that!\"\n\n\"Ah, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux, you are generous in this matter. I see\nit and I thank you for it. Thus, then, you will take this bag, and you\nwill go away without being too malcontent.\"\n\n\"I go away enchanted.\"\n\n\"Farewell, then, or rather, AU REVOIR!\"\n\nAnd the cardinal made him a sign with his hand, to which Bonacieux\nreplied by bowing to the ground. He then went out backward, and when he\nwas in the antechamber the cardinal heard him, in his enthusiasm, crying\naloud, \"Long life to the Monseigneur! Long life to his Eminence! Long\nlife to the great cardinal!\" The cardinal listened with a smile to this\nvociferous manifestation of the feelings of M. Bonacieux; and then, when\nBonacieux's cries were no longer audible, \"Good!\" said he, \"that man\nwould henceforward lay down his life for me.\" And the cardinal began to\nexamine with the greatest attention the map of La Rochelle, which, as we\nhave said, lay open on the desk, tracing with a pencil the line in which\nthe famous dyke was to pass which, eighteen months later, shut up the\nport of the besieged city. As he was in the deepest of his strategic\nmeditations, the door opened, and Rochefort returned.\n\n\"Well?\" said the cardinal, eagerly, rising with a promptitude which\nproved the degree of importance he attached to the commission with which\nhe had charged the count.\n\n\"Well,\" said the latter, \"a young woman of about twenty-six or\ntwenty-eight years of age, and a man of from thirty-five to forty, have\nindeed lodged at the two houses pointed out by your Eminence; but the\nwoman left last night, and the man this morning.\"\n\n\"It was they!\" cried the cardinal, looking at the clock; \"and now it is\ntoo late to have them pursued. The duchess is at Tours, and the duke at\nBoulogne. It is in London they must be found.\"\n\n\"What are your Eminence's orders?\"\n\n\"Not a word of what has passed. Let the queen remain in perfect\nsecurity; let her be ignorant that we know her secret. Let her believe\nthat we are in search of some conspiracy or other. Send me the keeper of\nthe seals, Seguier.\"\n\n\"And that man, what has your Eminence done with him?\"\n\n\"What man?\" asked the cardinal.\n\n\"That Bonacieux.\"\n\n\"I have done with him all that could be done. I have made him a spy upon\nhis wife.\"\n\nThe Comte de Rochefort bowed like a man who acknowledges the superiority\nof the master as great, and retired.\n\nLeft alone, the cardinal seated himself again and wrote a letter, which\nhe secured with his special seal. Then he rang. The officer entered for\nthe fourth time.\n\n\"Tell Vitray to come to me,\" said he, \"and tell him to get ready for a\njourney.\"\n\nAn instant after, the man he asked for was before him, booted and\nspurred.\n\n\"Vitray,\" said he, \"you will go with all speed to London. You must not\nstop an instant on the way. You will deliver this letter to Milady. Here\nis an order for two hundred pistoles; call upon my treasurer and get the\nmoney. You shall have as much again if you are back within six days, and\nhave executed your commission well.\"\n\nThe messenger, without replying a single word, bowed, took the letter,\nwith the order for the two hundred pistoles, and retired.\n\nHere is what the letter contained:\n\nMILADY, Be at the first ball at which the Duke of Buckingham shall be\npresent. He will wear on his doublet twelve diamond studs; get as near\nto him as you can, and cut off two.\n\nAs soon as these studs shall be in your possession, inform me.\n\n\n\n\n15 MEN OF THE ROBE AND MEN OF THE SWORD\n\nOn the day after these events had taken place, Athos not having\nreappeared, M. de Treville was informed by d'Artagnan and Porthos of the\ncircumstance. As to Aramis, he had asked for leave of absence for five\ndays, and was gone, it was said, to Rouen on family business.\n\nM. de Treville was the father of his soldiers. The lowest or the least\nknown of them, as soon as he assumed the uniform of the company, was as\nsure of his aid and support as if he had been his own brother.\n\nHe repaired, then, instantly to the office of the LIEUTENANT-CRIMINEL.\nThe officer who commanded the post of the Red Cross was sent for, and by\nsuccessive inquiries they learned that Athos was then lodged in the Fort\nl'Eveque.\n\nAthos had passed through all the examinations we have seen Bonacieux\nundergo.\n\nWe were present at the scene in which the two captives were confronted\nwith each other. Athos, who had till that time said nothing for fear\nthat d'Artagnan, interrupted in his turn, should not have the time\nnecessary, from this moment declared that his name was Athos, and not\nd'Artagnan. He added that he did not know either M. or Mme. Bonacieux;\nthat he had never spoken to the one or the other; that he had come,\nat about ten o'clock in the evening, to pay a visit to his friend M.\nd'Artagnan, but that till that hour he had been at M. de Treville's,\nwhere he had dined. \"Twenty witnesses,\" added he, \"could attest the\nfact\"; and he named several distinguished gentlemen, and among them was\nM. le Duc de la Tremouille.\n\nThe second commissary was as much bewildered as the first had been\nby the simple and firm declaration of the Musketeer, upon whom he was\nanxious to take the revenge which men of the robe like at all times to\ngain over men of the sword; but the name of M. de Treville, and that of\nM. de la Tremouille, commanded a little reflection.\n\nAthos was then sent to the cardinal; but unfortunately the cardinal was\nat the Louvre with the king.\n\nIt was precisely at this moment that M. de Treville, on leaving the\nresidence of the LIEUTENANT-CRIMINEL and the governor of the Fort\nl'Eveque without being able to find Athos, arrived at the palace.\n\nAs captain of the Musketeers, M. de Treville had the right of entry at\nall times.\n\nIt is well known how violent the king's prejudices were against the\nqueen, and how carefully these prejudices were kept up by the cardinal,\nwho in affairs of intrigue mistrusted women infinitely more than men.\nOne of the grand causes of this prejudice was the friendship of Anne of\nAustria for Mme. de Chevreuse. These two women gave him more uneasiness\nthan the war with Spain, the quarrel with England, or the embarrassment\nof the finances. In his eyes and to his conviction, Mme. de Chevreuse\nnot only served the queen in her political intrigues, but, what\ntormented him still more, in her amorous intrigues.\n\nAt the first word the cardinal spoke of Mme. de Chevreuse--who, though\nexiled to Tours and believed to be in that city, had come to Paris,\nremained there five days, and outwitted the police--the king flew into a\nfurious passion. Capricious and unfaithful, the king wished to be called\nLouis the Just and Louis the Chaste. Posterity will find a difficulty in\nunderstanding this character, which history explains only by facts and\nnever by reason.\n\nBut when the cardinal added that not only Mme. de Chevreuse had been\nin Paris, but still further, that the queen had renewed with her one of\nthose mysterious correspondences which at that time was named a CABAL;\nwhen he affirmed that he, the cardinal, was about to unravel the most\nclosely twisted thread of this intrigue; that at the moment of arresting\nin the very act, with all the proofs about her, the queen's emissary\nto the exiled duchess, a Musketeer had dared to interrupt the course of\njustice violently, by falling sword in hand upon the honest men of the\nlaw, charged with investigating impartially the whole affair in order\nto place it before the eyes of the king--Louis XIII could not contain\nhimself, and he made a step toward the queen's apartment with that pale\nand mute indignation which, when in broke out, led this prince to the\ncommission of the most pitiless cruelty. And yet, in all this, the\ncardinal had not yet said a word about the Duke of Buckingham.\n\nAt this instant M. de Treville entered, cool, polite, and in\nirreproachable costume.\n\nInformed of what had passed by the presence of the cardinal and the\nalteration in the king's countenance, M. de Treville felt himself\nsomething like Samson before the Philistines.\n\nLouis XIII had already placed his hand on the knob of the door; at the\nnoise of M. de Treville's entrance he turned round. \"You arrive in good\ntime, monsieur,\" said the king, who, when his passions were raised to\na certain point, could not dissemble; \"I have learned some fine things\nconcerning your Musketeers.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said Treville, coldly, \"I have some pretty things to tell your\nMajesty concerning these gownsmen.\"\n\n\"What?\" said the king, with hauteur.\n\n\"I have the honor to inform your Majesty,\" continued M. de Treville, in\nthe same tone, \"that a party of PROCUREURS, commissaries, and men of\nthe police--very estimable people, but very inveterate, as it appears,\nagainst the uniform--have taken upon themselves to arrest in a house, to\nlead away through the open street, and throw into the Fort l'Eveque, all\nupon an order which they have refused to show me, one of my, or\nrather your Musketeers, sire, of irreproachable conduct, of an almost\nillustrious reputation, and whom your Majesty knows favorably, Monsieur\nAthos.\"\n\n\"Athos,\" said the king, mechanically; \"yes, certainly I know that name.\"\n\n\"Let your Majesty remember,\" said Treville, \"that Monsieur Athos is the\nMusketeer who, in the annoying duel which you are acquainted with, had\nthe misfortune to wound Monsieur de Cahusac so seriously. A PROPOS,\nmonseigneur,\" continued Treville. Addressing the cardinal, \"Monsieur de\nCahusac is quite recovered, is he not?\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the cardinal, biting his lips with anger.\n\n\"Athos, then, went to pay a visit to one of his friends absent at\nthe time,\" continued Treville, \"to a young Bearnais, a cadet in his\nMajesty's Guards, the company of Monsieur Dessessart, but scarcely\nhad he arrived at his friend's and taken up a book, while waiting his\nreturn, when a mixed crowd of bailiffs and soldiers came and laid siege\nto the house, broke open several doors--\"\n\nThe cardinal made the king a sign, which signified, \"That was on account\nof the affair about which I spoke to you.\"\n\n\"We all know that,\" interrupted the king; \"for all that was done for our\nservice.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Treville, \"it was also for your Majesty's service that one\nof my Musketeers, who was innocent, has been seized, that he has been\nplaced between two guards like a malefactor, and that this gallant man,\nwho has ten times shed his blood in your Majesty's service and is ready\nto shed it again, has been paraded through the midst of an insolent\npopulace?\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said the king, who began to be shaken, \"was it so managed?\"\n\n\"Monsieur de Treville,\" said the cardinal, with the greatest phlegm,\n\"does not tell your Majesty that this innocent Musketeer, this gallant\nman, had only an hour before attacked, sword in hand, four commissaries\nof inquiry, who were delegated by myself to examine into an affair of\nthe highest importance.\"\n\n\"I defy your Eminence to prove it,\" cried Treville, with his Gascon\nfreedom and military frankness; \"for one hour before, Monsieur Athos,\nwho, I will confide it to your Majesty, is really a man of the highest\nquality, did me the honor after having dined with me to be conversing in\nthe saloon of my hotel, with the Duc de la Tremouille and the Comte de\nChalus, who happened to be there.\"\n\nThe king looked at the cardinal.\n\n\"A written examination attests it,\" said the cardinal, replying aloud to\nthe mute interrogation of his Majesty; \"and the ill-treated people\nhave drawn up the following, which I have the honor to present to your\nMajesty.\"\n\n\"And is the written report of the gownsmen to be placed in comparison\nwith the word of honor of a swordsman?\" replied Treville haughtily.\n\n\"Come, come, Treville, hold your tongue,\" said the king.\n\n\"If his Eminence entertains any suspicion against one of my Musketeers,\"\nsaid Treville, \"the justice of Monsieur the Cardinal is so well known\nthat I demand an inquiry.\"\n\n\"In the house in which the judicial inquiry was made,\" continued the\nimpassive cardinal, \"there lodges, I believe, a young Bearnais, a friend\nof the Musketeer.\"\n\n\"Your Eminence means Monsieur d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"I mean a young man whom you patronize, Monsieur de Treville.\"\n\n\"Yes, your Eminence, it is the same.\"\n\n\"Do you not suspect this young man of having given bad counsel?\"\n\n\"To Athos, to a man double his age?\" interrupted Treville. \"No,\nmonseigneur. Besides, d'Artagnan passed the evening with me.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the cardinal, \"everybody seems to have passed the evening\nwith you.\"\n\n\"Does your Eminence doubt my word?\" said Treville, with a brow flushed\nwith anger.\n\n\"No, God forbid,\" said the cardinal; \"only, at what hour was he with\nyou?\"\n\n\"Oh, as to that I can speak positively, your Eminence; for as he came in\nI remarked that it was but half past nine by the clock, although I had\nbelieved it to be later.\"\n\n\"At what hour did he leave your hotel?\"\n\n\"At half past ten--an hour after the event.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied the cardinal, who could not for an instant suspect the\nloyalty of Treville, and who felt that the victory was escaping him,\n\"well, but Athos WAS taken in the house in the Rue des Fossoyeurs.\"\n\n\"Is one friend forbidden to visit another, or a Musketeer of my company\nto fraternize with a Guard of Dessessart's company?\"\n\n\"Yes, when the house where he fraternizes is suspected.\"\n\n\"That house is suspected, Treville,\" said the king; \"perhaps you did not\nknow it?\"\n\n\"Indeed, sire, I did not. The house may be suspected; but I deny that\nit is so in the part of it inhabited my Monsieur d'Artagnan, for I can\naffirm, sire, if I can believe what he says, that there does not exist\na more devoted servant of your Majesty, or a more profound admirer of\nMonsieur the Cardinal.\"\n\n\"Was it not this d'Artagnan who wounded Jussac one day, in that\nunfortunate encounter which took place near the Convent of the\nCarmes-Dechausses?\" asked the king, looking at the cardinal, who colored\nwith vexation.\n\n\"And the next day, Bernajoux. Yes, sire, yes, it is the same; and your\nMajesty has a good memory.\"\n\n\"Come, how shall we decide?\" said the king.\n\n\"That concerns your Majesty more than me,\" said the cardinal. \"I should\naffirm the culpability.\"\n\n\"And I deny it,\" said Treville. \"But his Majesty has judges, and these\njudges will decide.\"\n\n\"That is best,\" said the king. \"Send the case before the judges; it is\ntheir business to judge, and they shall judge.\"\n\n\"Only,\" replied Treville, \"it is a sad thing that in the unfortunate\ntimes in which we live, the purest life, the most incontestable virtue,\ncannot exempt a man from infamy and persecution. The army, I will\nanswer for it, will be but little pleased at being exposed to rigorous\ntreatment on account of police affairs.\"\n\nThe expression was imprudent; but M. de Treville launched it with\nknowledge of his cause. He was desirous of an explosion, because in that\ncase the mine throws forth fire, and fire enlightens.\n\n\"Police affairs!\" cried the king, taking up Treville's words, \"police\naffairs! And what do you know about them, Monsieur? Meddle with your\nMusketeers, and do not annoy me in this way. It appears, according to\nyour account, that if by mischance a Musketeer is arrested, France is\nin danger. What a noise about a Musketeer! I would arrest ten of them,\nVENTREBLEU, a hundred, even, all the company, and I would not allow a\nwhisper.\"\n\n\"From the moment they are suspected by your Majesty,\" said Treville,\n\"the Musketeers are guilty; therefore, you see me prepared to surrender\nmy sword--for after having accused my soldiers, there can be no doubt\nthat Monsieur the Cardinal will end by accusing me. It is best to\nconstitute myself at once a prisoner with Athos, who is already\narrested, and with d'Artagnan, who most probably will be.\"\n\n\"Gascon-headed man, will you have done?\" said the king.\n\n\"Sire,\" replied Treville, without lowering his voice in the least,\n\"either order my Musketeer to be restored to me, or let him be tried.\"\n\n\"He shall be tried,\" said the cardinal.\n\n\"Well, so much the better; for in that case I shall demand of his\nMajesty permission to plead for him.\"\n\nThe king feared an outbreak.\n\n\"If his Eminence,\" said he, \"did not have personal motives--\"\n\nThe cardinal saw what the king was about to say and interrupted him:\n\n\"Pardon me,\" said he; \"but the instant your Majesty considers me a\nprejudiced judge, I withdraw.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said the king, \"will you swear, by my father, that Athos was at\nyour residence during the event and that he took no part in it?\"\n\n\"By your glorious father, and by yourself, whom I love and venerate\nabove all the world, I swear it.\"\n\n\"Be so kind as to reflect, sire,\" said the cardinal. \"If we release the\nprisoner thus, we shall never know the truth.\"\n\n\"Athos may always be found,\" replied Treville, \"ready to answer, when\nit shall please the gownsmen to interrogate him. He will not desert,\nMonsieur the Cardinal, be assured of that; I will answer for him.\"\n\n\"No, he will not desert,\" said the king; \"he can always be found, as\nTreville says. Besides,\" added he, lowering his voice and looking with a\nsuppliant air at the cardinal, \"let us give them apparent security; that\nis policy.\"\n\nThis policy of Louis XIII made Richelieu smile.\n\n\"Order it as you please, sire; you possess the right of pardon.\"\n\n\"The right of pardoning only applies to the guilty,\" said Treville, who\nwas determined to have the last word, \"and my Musketeer is innocent. It\nis not mercy, then, that you are about to accord, sire, it is justice.\"\n\n\"And he is in the Fort l'Eveque?\" said the king.\n\n\"Yes, sire, in solitary confinement, in a dungeon, like the lowest\ncriminal.\"\n\n\"The devil!\" murmured the king; \"what must be done?\"\n\n\"Sign an order for his release, and all will be said,\" replied the\ncardinal. \"I believe with your Majesty that Monsieur de Treville's\nguarantee is more than sufficient.\"\n\nTreville bowed very respectfully, with a joy that was not unmixed with\nfear; he would have preferred an obstinate resistance on the part of the\ncardinal to this sudden yielding.\n\nThe king signed the order for release, and Treville carried it away\nwithout delay. As he was about to leave the presence, the cardinal gave\nhim a friendly smile, and said, \"A perfect harmony reigns, sire,\nbetween the leaders and the soldiers of your Musketeers, which must be\nprofitable for the service and honorable to all.\"\n\n\"He will play me some dog's trick or other, and that immediately,\" said\nTreville. \"One has never the last word with such a man. But let us be\nquick--the king may change his mind in an hour; and at all events it is\nmore difficult to replace a man in the Fort l'Eveque or the Bastille who\nhas got out, than to keep a prisoner there who is in.\"\n\nM. de Treville made his entrance triumphantly into the Fort l'Eveque,\nwhence he delivered the Musketeer, whose peaceful indifference had not\nfor a moment abandoned him.\n\nThe first time he saw d'Artagnan, \"You have come off well,\" said he to\nhim; \"there is your Jussac thrust paid for. There still remains that of\nBernajoux, but you must not be too confident.\"\n\nAs to the rest, M. de Treville had good reason to mistrust the cardinal\nand to think that all was not over, for scarcely had the captain of\nthe Musketeers closed the door after him, than his Eminence said to the\nking, \"Now that we are at length by ourselves, we will, if your Majesty\npleases, converse seriously. Sire, Buckingham has been in Paris five\ndays, and only left this morning.\"\n\n\n\n\n16 IN WHICH M. SEGUIER, KEEPER OF THE SEALS, LOOKS MORE THAN ONCE FOR\nTHE BELL, IN ORDER TO RING IT, AS HE DID BEFORE\n\nIt is impossible to form an idea of the impression these few words made\nupon Louis XIII. He grew pale and red alternately; and the cardinal saw\nat once that he had recovered by a single blow all the ground he had\nlost.\n\n\"Buckingham in Paris!\" cried he, \"and why does he come?\"\n\n\"To conspire, no doubt, with your enemies, the Huguenots and the\nSpaniards.\"\n\n\"No, PARDIEU, no! To conspire against my honor with Madame de Chevreuse,\nMadame de Longueville, and the Condes.\"\n\n\"Oh, sire, what an idea! The queen is too virtuous; and besides, loves\nyour Majesty too well.\"\n\n\"Woman is weak, Monsieur Cardinal,\" said the king; \"and as to loving me\nmuch, I have my own opinion as to that love.\"\n\n\"I not the less maintain,\" said the cardinal, \"that the Duke of\nBuckingham came to Paris for a project wholly political.\"\n\n\"And I am sure that he came for quite another purpose, Monsieur\nCardinal; but if the queen be guilty, let her tremble!\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said the cardinal, \"whatever repugnance I may have to\ndirecting my mind to such a treason, your Majesty compels me to think of\nit. Madame de Lannoy, whom, according to your Majesty's command, I have\nfrequently interrogated, told me this morning that the night before last\nher Majesty sat up very late, that this morning she wept much, and that\nshe was writing all day.\"\n\n\"That's it!\" cried the king; \"to him, no doubt. Cardinal, I must have\nthe queen's papers.\"\n\n\"But how to take them, sire? It seems to me that it is neither your\nMajesty nor myself who can charge himself with such a mission.\"\n\n\"How did they act with regard to the Marechale d'Ancre?\" cried the\nking, in the highest state of choler; \"first her closets were thoroughly\nsearched, and then she herself.\"\n\n\"The Marechale d'Ancre was no more than the Marechale d'Ancre. A\nFlorentine adventurer, sire, and that was all; while the august spouse\nof your Majesty is Anne of Austria, Queen of France--that is to say, one\nof the greatest princesses in the world.\"\n\n\"She is not the less guilty, Monsieur Duke! The more she has forgotten\nthe high position in which she was placed, the more degrading is her\nfall. Besides, I long ago determined to put an end to all these petty\nintrigues of policy and love. She has near her a certain Laporte.\"\n\n\"Who, I believe, is the mainspring of all this, I confess,\" said the\ncardinal.\n\n\"You think then, as I do, that she deceives me?\" said the king.\n\n\"I believe, and I repeat it to your Majesty, that the queen conspires\nagainst the power of the king, but I have not said against his honor.\"\n\n\"And I--I tell you against both. I tell you the queen does not love\nme; I tell you she loves another; I tell you she loves that infamous\nBuckingham! Why did you not have him arrested while in Paris?\"\n\n\"Arrest the Duke! Arrest the prime minister of King Charles I! Think of\nit, sire! What a scandal! And if the suspicions of your Majesty, which\nI still continue to doubt, should prove to have any foundation, what a\nterrible disclosure, what a fearful scandal!\"\n\n\"But as he exposed himself like a vagabond or a thief, he should have\nbeen--\"\n\nLouis XIII stopped, terrified at what he was about to say, while\nRichelieu, stretching out his neck, waited uselessly for the word which\nhad died on the lips of the king.\n\n\"He should have been--?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said the king, \"nothing. But all the time he was in Paris,\nyou, of course, did not lose sight of him?\"\n\n\"No, sire.\"\n\n\"Where did he lodge?\"\n\n\"Rue de la Harpe. No. 75.\"\n\n\"Where is that?\"\n\n\"By the side of the Luxembourg.\"\n\n\"And you are certain that the queen and he did not see each other?\"\n\n\"I believe the queen to have too high a sense of her duty, sire.\"\n\n\"But they have corresponded; it is to him that the queen has been\nwriting all the day. Monsieur Duke, I must have those letters!\"\n\n\"Sire, notwithstanding--\"\n\n\"Monsieur Duke, at whatever price it may be, I will have them.\"\n\n\"I would, however, beg your Majesty to observe--\"\n\n\"Do you, then, also join in betraying me, Monsieur Cardinal, by thus\nalways opposing my will? Are you also in accord with Spain and England,\nwith Madame de Chevreuse and the queen?\"\n\n\"Sire,\" replied the cardinal, sighing, \"I believed myself secure from\nsuch a suspicion.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Cardinal, you have heard me; I will have those letters.\"\n\n\"There is but one way.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"That would be to charge Monsieur de Seguier, the keeper of the seals,\nwith this mission. The matter enters completely into the duties of the\npost.\"\n\n\"Let him be sent for instantly.\"\n\n\"He is most likely at my hotel. I requested him to call, and when I came\nto the Louvre I left orders if he came, to desire him to wait.\"\n\n\"Let him be sent for instantly.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty's orders shall be executed; but--\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"But the queen will perhaps refuse to obey.\"\n\n\"My orders?\"\n\n\"Yes, if she is ignorant that these orders come from the king.\"\n\n\"Well, that she may have no doubt on that head, I will go and inform her\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty will not forget that I have done everything in my power to\nprevent a rupture.\"\n\n\"Yes, Duke, yes, I know you are very indulgent toward the queen, too\nindulgent, perhaps; we shall have occasion, I warn you, at some future\nperiod to speak of that.\"\n\n\"Whenever it shall please your Majesty; but I shall be always happy and\nproud, sire, to sacrifice myself to the harmony which I desire to see\nreign between you and the Queen of France.\"\n\n\"Very well, Cardinal, very well; but, meantime, send for Monsieur the\nKeeper of the Seals. I will go to the queen.\"\n\nAnd Louis XIII, opening the door of communication, passed into the\ncorridor which led from his apartments to those of Anne of Austria.\n\nThe queen was in the midst of her women--Mme. de Guitaut, Mme. de Sable,\nMme. de Montbazon, and Mme. de Guemene. In a corner was the Spanish\ncompanion, Donna Estafania, who had followed her from Madrid. Mme.\nGuemene was reading aloud, and everybody was listening to her with\nattention with the exception of the queen, who had, on the contrary,\ndesired this reading in order that she might be able, while feigning to\nlisten, to pursue the thread of her own thoughts.\n\nThese thoughts, gilded as they were by a last reflection of love, were\nnot the less sad. Anne of Austria, deprived of the confidence of her\nhusband, pursued by the hatred of the cardinal, who could not pardon her\nfor having repulsed a more tender feeling, having before her eyes the\nexample of the queen-mother whom that hatred had tormented all her\nlife--though Marie de Medicis, if the memoirs of the time are to be\nbelieved, had begun by according to the cardinal that sentiment which\nAnne of Austria always refused him--Anne of Austria had seen her most\ndevoted servants fall around her, her most intimate confidants, her\ndearest favorites. Like those unfortunate persons endowed with a fatal\ngift, she brought misfortune upon everything she touched. Her friendship\nwas a fatal sign which called down persecution. Mme. de Chevreuse\nand Mme. de Bernet were exiled, and Laporte did not conceal from his\nmistress that he expected to be arrested every instant.\n\nIt was at the moment when she was plunged in the deepest and darkest\nof these reflections that the door of the chamber opened, and the king\nentered.\n\nThe reader hushed herself instantly. All the ladies rose, and there\nwas a profound silence. As to the king, he made no demonstration of\npoliteness, only stopping before the queen. \"Madame,\" said he, \"you\nare about to receive a visit from the chancellor, who will communicate\ncertain matters to you with which I have charged him.\"\n\nThe unfortunate queen, who was constantly threatened with divorce,\nexile, and trial even, turned pale under her rouge, and could not\nrefrain from saying, \"But why this visit, sire? What can the chancellor\nhave to say to me that your Majesty could not say yourself?\"\n\nThe king turned upon his heel without reply, and almost at the same\ninstant the captain of the Guards, M. de Guitant, announced the visit of\nthe chancellor.\n\nWhen the chancellor appeared, the king had already gone out by another\ndoor.\n\nThe chancellor entered, half smiling, half blushing. As we shall\nprobably meet with him again in the course of our history, it may be\nwell for our readers to be made at once acquainted with him.\n\nThis chancellor was a pleasant man. He was Des Roches le Masle, canon of\nNotre Dame, who had formerly been valet of a bishop, who introduced him\nto his Eminence as a perfectly devout man. The cardinal trusted him, and\ntherein found his advantage.\n\nThere are many stories related of him, and among them this. After a wild\nyouth, he had retired into a convent, there to expiate, at least for\nsome time, the follies of adolescence. On entering this holy place, the\npoor penitent was unable to shut the door so close as to prevent the\npassions he fled from entering with him. He was incessantly attacked by\nthem, and the superior, to whom he had confided this misfortune, wishing\nas much as in him lay to free him from them, had advised him, in order\nto conjure away the tempting demon, to have recourse to the bell rope,\nand ring with all his might. At the denunciating sound, the monks would\nbe rendered aware that temptation was besieging a brother, and all the\ncommunity would go to prayers.\n\nThis advice appeared good to the future chancellor. He conjured the evil\nspirit with abundance of prayers offered up by the monks. But the devil\ndoes not suffer himself to be easily dispossessed from a place in which\nhe has fixed his garrison. In proportion as they redoubled the exorcisms\nhe redoubled the temptations; so that day and night the bell was ringing\nfull swing, announcing the extreme desire for mortification which the\npenitent experienced.\n\nThe monks had no longer an instant of repose. By day they did nothing\nbut ascend and descend the steps which led to the chapel; at night,\nin addition to complines and matins, they were further obliged to leap\ntwenty times out of their beds and prostrate themselves on the floor of\ntheir cells.\n\nIt is not known whether it was the devil who gave way, or the monks who\ngrew tired; but within three months the penitent reappeared in the\nworld with the reputation of being the most terrible POSSESSED that ever\nexisted.\n\nOn leaving the convent he entered into the magistracy, became president\non the place of his uncle, embraced the cardinal's party, which did not\nprove want of sagacity, became chancellor, served his Eminence with zeal\nin his hatred against the queen-mother and his vengeance against Anne of\nAustria, stimulated the judges in the affair of Calais, encouraged the\nattempts of M. de Laffemas, chief gamekeeper of France; then, at length,\ninvested with the entire confidence of the cardinal--a confidence which\nhe had so well earned--he received the singular commission for the\nexecution of which he presented himself in the queen's apartments.\n\nThe queen was still standing when he entered; but scarcely had she\nperceived him then she reseated herself in her armchair, and made a sign\nto her women to resume their cushions and stools, and with an air of\nsupreme hauteur, said, \"What do you desire, monsieur, and with what\nobject do you present yourself here?\"\n\n\"To make, madame, in the name of the king, and without prejudice to\nthe respect which I have the honor to owe to your Majesty a close\nexamination into all your papers.\"\n\n\"How, monsieur, an investigation of my papers--mine! Truly, this is an\nindignity!\"\n\n\"Be kind enough to pardon me, madame; but in this circumstance I am but\nthe instrument which the king employs. Has not his Majesty just left\nyou, and has he not himself asked you to prepare for this visit?\"\n\n\"Search, then, monsieur! I am a criminal, as it appears. Estafania, give\nup the keys of my drawers and my desks.\"\n\nFor form's sake the chancellor paid a visit to the pieces of furniture\nnamed; but he well knew that it was not in a piece of furniture that the\nqueen would place the important letter she had written that day.\n\nWhen the chancellor had opened and shut twenty times the drawers of\nthe secretaries, it became necessary, whatever hesitation he might\nexperience--it became necessary, I say, to come to the conclusion of\nthe affair; that is to say, to search the queen herself. The chancellor\nadvanced, therefore, toward Anne of Austria, and said with a very\nperplexed and embarrassed air, \"And now it remains for me to make the\nprincipal examination.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" asked the queen, who did not understand, or rather was\nnot willing to understand.\n\n\"His majesty is certain that a letter has been written by you during the\nday; he knows that it has not yet been sent to its address. This letter\nis not in your table nor in your secretary; and yet this letter must be\nsomewhere.\"\n\n\"Would you dare to lift your hand to your queen?\" said Anne of Austria,\ndrawing herself up to her full height, and fixing her eyes upon the\nchancellor with an expression almost threatening.\n\n\"I am a faithful subject of the king, madame, and all that his Majesty\ncommands I shall do.\"\n\n\"Well, it is true!\" said Anne of Austria; \"and the spies of the cardinal\nhave served him faithfully. I have written a letter today; that letter\nis not yet gone. The letter is here.\" And the queen laid her beautiful\nhand on her bosom.\n\n\"Then give me that letter, madame,\" said the chancellor.\n\n\"I will give it to none but the king monsieur,\" said Anne.\n\n\"If the king had desired that the letter should be given to him, madame,\nhe would have demanded it of you himself. But I repeat to you, I am\ncharged with reclaiming it; and if you do not give it up--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"He has, then, charged me to take it from you.\"\n\n\"How! What do you say?\"\n\n\"That my orders go far, madame; and that I am authorized to seek for the\nsuspected paper, even on the person of your Majesty.\"\n\n\"What horror!\" cried the queen.\n\n\"Be kind enough, then, madame, to act more compliantly.\"\n\n\"The conduct is infamously violent! Do you know that, monsieur?\"\n\n\"The king commands it, madame; excuse me.\"\n\n\"I will not suffer it! No, no, I would rather die!\" cried the queen, in\nwhom the imperious blood of Spain and Austria began to rise.\n\nThe chancellor made a profound reverence. Then, with the intention\nquite patent of not drawing back a foot from the accomplishment of\nthe commission with which he was charged, and as the attendant of an\nexecutioner might have done in the chamber of torture, he approached\nAnne of Austria, for whose eyes at the same instant sprang tears of\nrage.\n\nThe queen was, as we have said, of great beauty. The commission might\nwell be called delicate; and the king had reached, in his jealousy of\nBuckingham, the point of not being jealous of anyone else.\n\nWithout doubt the chancellor, Seguier looked about at that moment\nfor the rope of the famous bell; but not finding it he summoned his\nresolution, and stretched forth his hands toward the place where the\nqueen had acknowledged the paper was to be found.\n\nAnne of Austria took one step backward, became so pale that it might be\nsaid she was dying, and leaning with her left hand upon a table behind\nher to keep herself from falling, she with her right hand drew the paper\nfrom her bosom and held it out to the keeper of the seals.\n\n\"There, monsieur, there is that letter!\" cried the queen, with a\nbroken and trembling voice; \"take it, and deliver me from your odious\npresence.\"\n\nThe chancellor, who, on his part, trembled with an emotion easily to be\nconceived, took the letter, bowed to the ground, and retired. The door\nwas scarcely closed upon him, when the queen sank, half fainting, into\nthe arms of her women.\n\nThe chancellor carried the letter to the king without having read a\nsingle word of it. The king took it with a trembling hand, looked for\nthe address, which was wanting, became very pale, opened it slowly, then\nseeing by the first words that it was addressed to the King of Spain, he\nread it rapidly.\n\nIt was nothing but a plan of attack against the cardinal. The queen\npressed her brother and the Emperor of Austria to appear to be wounded,\nas they really were, by the policy of Richelieu--the eternal object of\nwhich was the abasement of the house of Austria--to declare war against\nFrance, and as a condition of peace, to insist upon the dismissal of the\ncardinal; but as to love, there was not a single word about it in all\nthe letter.\n\nThe king, quite delighted, inquired if the cardinal was still at the\nLouvre; he was told that his Eminence awaited the orders of his Majesty\nin the business cabinet.\n\nThe king went straight to him.\n\n\"There, Duke,\" said he, \"you were right and I was wrong. The whole\nintrigue is political, and there is not the least question of love in\nthis letter; but, on the other hand, there is abundant question of you.\"\n\nThe cardinal took the letter, and read it with the greatest attention;\nthen, when he had arrived at the end of it, he read it a second time.\n\"Well, your Majesty,\" said he, \"you see how far my enemies go; they\nmenace you with two wars if you do not dismiss me. In your place, in\ntruth, sire, I should yield to such powerful instance; and on my part,\nit would be a real happiness to withdraw from public affairs.\"\n\n\"What say you, Duke?\"\n\n\"I say, sire, that my health is sinking under these excessive struggles\nand these never-ending labors. I say that according to all probability\nI shall not be able to undergo the fatigues of the siege of La Rochelle,\nand that it would be far better that you should appoint there either\nMonsieur de Conde, Monsieur de Bassopierre, or some valiant gentleman\nwhose business is war, and not me, who am a churchman, and who am\nconstantly turned aside for my real vocation to look after matters for\nwhich I have no aptitude. You would be the happier for it at home, sire,\nand I do not doubt you would be the greater for it abroad.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Duke,\" said the king, \"I understand you. Be satisfied, all\nwho are named in that letter shall be punished as they deserve, even the\nqueen herself.\"\n\n\"What do you say, sire? God forbid that the queen should suffer the\nleast inconvenience or uneasiness on my account! She has always believed\nme, sire, to be her enemy; although your Majesty can bear witness that I\nhave always taken her part warmly, even against you. Oh, if she betrayed\nyour Majesty on the side of your honor, it would be quite another thing,\nand I should be the first to say, 'No grace, sire--no grace for the\nguilty!' Happily, there is nothing of the kind, and your Majesty has\njust acquired a new proof of it.\"\n\n\"That is true, Monsieur Cardinal,\" said the king, \"and you were right,\nas you always are; but the queen, not the less, deserves all my anger.\"\n\n\"It is you, sire, who have now incurred hers. And even if she were to be\nseriously offended, I could well understand it; your Majesty has treated\nher with a severity--\"\n\n\"It is thus I will always treat my enemies and yours, Duke, however high\nthey may be placed, and whatever peril I may incur in acting severely\ntoward them.\"\n\n\"The queen is my enemy, but is not yours, sire; on the contrary, she is\na devoted, submissive, and irreproachable wife. Allow me, then, sire, to\nintercede for her with your Majesty.\"\n\n\"Let her humble herself, then, and come to me first.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, sire, set the example. You have committed the first\nwrong, since it was you who suspected the queen.\"\n\n\"What! I make the first advances?\" said the king. \"Never!\"\n\n\"Sire, I entreat you to do so.\"\n\n\"Besides, in what manner can I make advances first?\"\n\n\"By doing a thing which you know will be agreeable to her.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"Give a ball; you know how much the queen loves dancing. I will answer\nfor it, her resentment will not hold out against such an attention.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Cardinal, you know that I do not like worldly pleasures.\"\n\n\"The queen will only be the more grateful to you, as she knows your\nantipathy for that amusement; besides, it will be an opportunity for\nher to wear those beautiful diamonds which you gave her recently on her\nbirthday and with which she has since had no occasion to adorn herself.\"\n\n\"We shall see, Monsieur Cardinal, we shall see,\" said the king, who,\nin his joy at finding the queen guilty of a crime which he cared little\nabout, and innocent of a fault of which he had great dread, was ready to\nmake up all differences with her, \"we shall see, but upon my honor, you\nare too indulgent toward her.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said the cardinal, \"leave severity to your ministers. Clemency\nis a royal virtue; employ it, and you will find that you derive\nadvantage therein.\"\n\nThereupon the cardinal, hearing the clock strike eleven, bowed low,\nasking permission of the king to retire, and supplicating him to come to\na good understanding with the queen.\n\nAnne of Austria, who, in consequence of the seizure of her letter,\nexpected reproaches, was much astonished the next day to see the king\nmake some attempts at reconciliation with her. Her first movement was\nrepellent. Her womanly pride and her queenly dignity had both been so\ncruelly offended that she could not come round at the first advance;\nbut, overpersuaded by the advice of her women, she at last had the\nappearance of beginning to forget. The king took advantage of this\nfavorable moment to tell her that her had the intention of shortly\ngiving a fete.\n\nA fete was so rare a thing for poor Anne of Austria that at this\nannouncement, as the cardinal had predicted, the last trace of her\nresentment disappeared, if not from her heart at least from her\ncountenance. She asked upon what day this fete would take place, but the\nking replied that he must consult the cardinal upon that head.\n\nIndeed, every day the king asked the cardinal when this fete should take\nplace; and every day the cardinal, under some pretext, deferred fixing\nit. Ten days passed away thus.\n\nOn the eighth day after the scene we have described, the cardinal\nreceived a letter with the London stamp which only contained these\nlines: \"I have them; but I am unable to leave London for want of money.\nSend me five hundred pistoles, and four or five days after I have\nreceived them I shall be in Paris.\"\n\nOn the same day the cardinal received this letter the king put his\ncustomary question to him.\n\nRichelieu counted on his fingers, and said to himself, \"She will arrive,\nshe says, four or five days after having received the money. It will\nrequire four or five days for the transmission of the money, four or\nfive days for her to return; that makes ten days. Now, allowing for\ncontrary winds, accidents, and a woman's weakness, there are twelve\ndays.\"\n\n\"Well, Monsieur Duke,\" said the king, \"have you made your calculations?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire. Today is the twentieth of September. The aldermen of the\ncity give a fete on the third of October. That will fall in wonderfully\nwell; you will not appear to have gone out of your way to please the\nqueen.\"\n\nThen the cardinal added, \"A PROPOS, sire, do not forget to tell her\nMajesty the evening before the fete that you should like to see how her\ndiamond studs become her.\"\n\n\n\n\n17 BONACIEUX AT HOME\n\nIt was the second time the cardinal had mentioned these diamond studs to\nthe king. Louis XIII was struck with this insistence, and began to fancy\nthat this recommendation concealed some mystery.\n\nMore than once the king had been humiliated by the cardinal, whose\npolice, without having yet attained the perfection of the modern police,\nwere excellent, being better informed than himself, even upon what was\ngoing on in his own household. He hoped, then, in a conversation with\nAnne of Austria, to obtain some information from that conversation, and\nafterward to come upon his Eminence with some secret which the cardinal\neither knew or did not know, but which, in either case, would raise him\ninfinitely in the eyes of his minister.\n\nHe went then to the queen, and according to custom accosted her with\nfresh menaces against those who surrounded her. Anne of Austria lowered\nher head, allowed the torrent to flow on without replying, hoping that\nit would cease of itself; but this was not what Louis XIII meant. Louis\nXIII wanted a discussion from which some light or other might break,\nconvinced as he was that the cardinal had some afterthought and was\npreparing for him one of those terrible surprises which his Eminence was\nso skillful in getting up. He arrived at this end by his persistence in\naccusation.\n\n\"But,\" cried Anne of Austria, tired of these vague attacks, \"but, sire,\nyou do not tell me all that you have in your heart. What have I done,\nthen? Let me know what crime I have committed. It is impossible\nthat your Majesty can make all this ado about a letter written to my\nbrother.\"\n\nThe king, attacked in a manner so direct, did not know what to answer;\nand he thought that this was the moment for expressing the desire which\nhe was not going to have made until the evening before the fete.\n\n\"Madame,\" said he, with dignity, \"there will shortly be a ball at the\nHotel de Ville. I wish, in order to honor our worthy aldermen, you\nshould appear in ceremonial costume, and above all, ornamented with the\ndiamond studs which I gave you on your birthday. That is my answer.\"\n\nThe answer was terrible. Anne of Austria believed that Louis XIII\nknew all, and that the cardinal had persuaded him to employ this\nlong dissimulation of seven or eight days, which, likewise, was\ncharacteristic. She became excessively pale, leaned her beautiful hand\nupon a CONSOLE, which hand appeared then like one of wax, and looking\nat the king with terror in her eyes, she was unable to reply by a single\nsyllable.\n\n\"You hear, madame,\" said the king, who enjoyed the embarrassment to its\nfull extent, but without guessing the cause. \"You hear, madame?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, I hear,\" stammered the queen.\n\n\"You will appear at this ball?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"With those studs?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe queen's paleness, if possible, increased; the king perceived it, and\nenjoyed it with that cold cruelty which was one of the worst sides of\nhis character.\n\n\"Then that is agreed,\" said the king, \"and that is all I had to say to\nyou.\"\n\n\"But on what day will this ball take place?\" asked Anne of Austria.\n\nLouis XIII felt instinctively that he ought not to reply to this\nquestion, the queen having put it in an almost dying voice.\n\n\"Oh, very shortly, madame,\" said he; \"but I do not precisely recollect\nthe date of the day. I will ask the cardinal.\"\n\n\"It was the cardinal, then, who informed you of this fete?\"\n\n\"Yes, madame,\" replied the astonished king; \"but why do you ask that?\"\n\n\"It was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs?\"\n\n\"That is to say, madame--\"\n\n\"It was he, sire, it was he!\"\n\n\"Well, and what does it signify whether it was he or I? Is there any\ncrime in this request?\"\n\n\"No, sire.\"\n\n\"Then you will appear?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"That is well,\" said the king, retiring, \"that is well; I count upon\nit.\"\n\nThe queen made a curtsy, less from etiquette than because her knees were\nsinking under her. The king went away enchanted.\n\n\"I am lost,\" murmured the queen, \"lost!--for the cardinal knows all, and\nit is he who urges on the king, who as yet knows nothing but will soon\nknow everything. I am lost! My God, my God, my God!\"\n\nShe knelt upon a cushion and prayed, with her head buried between her\npalpitating arms.\n\nIn fact, her position was terrible. Buckingham had returned to London;\nMme. Chevreuse was at Tours. More closely watched than ever, the queen\nfelt certain, without knowing how to tell which, that one of her women\nhad betrayed her. Laporte could not leave the Louvre; she had not a soul\nin the world in whom she could confide. Thus, while contemplating the\nmisfortune which threatened her and the abandonment in which she was\nleft, she broke out into sobs and tears.\n\n\"Can I be of service to your Majesty?\" said all at once a voice full of\nsweetness and pity.\n\nThe queen turned sharply round, for there could be no deception in the\nexpression of that voice; it was a friend who spoke thus.\n\nIn fact, at one of the doors which opened into the queen's apartment\nappeared the pretty Mme. Bonacieux. She had been engaged in arranging\nthe dresses and linen in a closet when the king entered; she could not\nget out and had heard all.\n\nThe queen uttered a piercing cry at finding herself surprised--for in\nher trouble she did not at first recognize the young woman who had been\ngiven to her by Laporte.\n\n\"Oh, fear nothing, madame!\" said the young woman, clasping her hands and\nweeping herself at the queen's sorrows; \"I am your Majesty's, body and\nsoul, and however far I may be from you, however inferior may be my\nposition, I believe I have discovered a means of extricating your\nMajesty from your trouble.\"\n\n\"You, oh, heaven, you!\" cried the queen; \"but look me in the face. I am\nbetrayed on all sides. Can I trust in you?\"\n\n\"Oh, madame!\" cried the young woman, falling on her knees; \"upon my\nsoul, I am ready to die for your Majesty!\"\n\nThis expression sprang from the very bottom of the heart, and, like the\nfirst, there was no mistaking it.\n\n\"Yes,\" continued Mme. Bonacieux, \"yes, there are traitors here; but by\nthe holy name of the Virgin, I swear that no one is more devoted to your\nMajesty than I am. Those studs which the king speaks of, you gave them\nto the Duke of Buckingham, did you not? Those studs were enclosed in a\nlittle rosewood box which he held under his arm? Am I deceived? Is it\nnot so, madame?\"\n\n\"Oh, my God, my God!\" murmured the queen, whose teeth chattered with\nfright.\n\n\"Well, those studs,\" continued Mme. Bonacieux, \"we must have them back\nagain.\"\n\n\"Yes, without doubt, it is necessary,\" cried the queen; \"but how am I to\nact? How can it be effected?\"\n\n\"Someone must be sent to the duke.\"\n\n\"But who, who? In whom can I trust?\"\n\n\"Place confidence in me, madame; do me that honor, my queen, and I will\nfind a messenger.\"\n\n\"But I must write.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; that is indispensable. Two words from the hand of your Majesty\nand your private seal.\"\n\n\"But these two words would bring about my condemnation, divorce, exile!\"\n\n\"Yes, if they fell into infamous hands. But I will answer for these two\nwords being delivered to their address.\"\n\n\"Oh, my God! I must then place my life, my honor, my reputation, in your\nhands?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, madame, you must; and I will save them all.\"\n\n\"But how? Tell me at least the means.\"\n\n\"My husband had been at liberty these two or three days. I have not yet\nhad time to see him again. He is a worthy, honest man who entertains\nneither love nor hatred for anybody. He will do anything I wish. He\nwill set out upon receiving an order from me, without knowing what he\ncarries, and he will carry your Majesty's letter, without even knowing\nit is from your Majesty, to the address which is on it.\"\n\nThe queen took the two hands of the young woman with a burst of emotion,\ngazed at her as if to read her very heart, and seeing nothing but\nsincerity in her beautiful eyes, embraced her tenderly.\n\n\"Do that,\" cried she, \"and you will have saved my life, you will have\nsaved my honor!\"\n\n\"Do not exaggerate the service I have the happiness to render your\nMajesty. I have nothing to save for your Majesty; you are only the\nvictim of perfidious plots.\"\n\n\"That is true, that is true, my child,\" said the queen, \"you are right.\"\n\n\"Give me then, that letter, madame; time presses.\"\n\nThe queen ran to a little table, on which were ink, paper, and pens. She\nwrote two lines, sealed the letter with her private seal, and gave it to\nMme. Bonacieux.\n\n\"And now,\" said the queen, \"we are forgetting one very necessary thing.\"\n\n\"What is that, madame?\"\n\n\"Money.\"\n\nMme. Bonacieux blushed.\n\n\"Yes, that is true,\" said she, \"and I will confess to your Majesty that\nmy husband--\"\n\n\"Your husband has none. Is that what you would say?\"\n\n\"He has some, but he is very avaricious; that is his fault.\nNevertheless, let not your Majesty be uneasy, we will find means.\"\n\n\"And I have none, either,\" said the queen. Those who have read the\nMEMOIRS of Mme. de Motteville will not be astonished at this reply. \"But\nwait a minute.\"\n\nAnne of Austria ran to her jewel case.\n\n\"Here,\" said she, \"here is a ring of great value, as I have been\nassured. It came from my brother, the King of Spain. It is mine, and I\nam at liberty to dispose of it. Take this ring; raise money with it, and\nlet your husband set out.\"\n\n\"In an hour you shall be obeyed.\"\n\n\"You see the address,\" said the queen, speaking so low that Mme.\nBonacieux could hardly hear what she said, \"To my Lord Duke of\nBuckingham, London.\"\n\n\"The letter shall be given to himself.\"\n\n\"Generous girl!\" cried Anne of Austria.\n\nMme. Bonacieux kissed the hands of the queen, concealed the paper in the\nbosom of her dress, and disappeared with the lightness of a bird.\n\nTen minutes afterward she was at home. As she told the queen, she had\nnot seen her husband since his liberation; she was ignorant of the\nchange that had taken place in him with respect to the cardinal--a\nchange which had since been strengthened by two or three visits from the\nComte de Rochefort, who had become the best friend of Bonacieux, and had\npersuaded him, without much trouble, was putting his house in order,\nthe furniture of which he had found mostly broken and his closets nearly\nempty--justice not being one of the three things which King Solomon\nnames as leaving no traces of their passage. As to the servant, she had\nrun away at the moment of her master's arrest. Terror had had such an\neffect upon the poor girl that she had never ceased walking from Paris\ntill she reached Burgundy, her native place.\n\nThe worthy mercer had, immediately upon re-entering his house, informed\nhis wife of his happy return, and his wife had replied by congratulating\nhim, and telling him that the first moment she could steal from her\nduties should be devoted to paying him a visit.\n\nThis first moment had been delayed five days, which, under any other\ncircumstances, might have appeared rather long to M. Bonacieux; but\nhe had, in the visit he had made to the cardinal and in the visits\nRochefort had made him, ample subjects for reflection, and as everybody\nknows, nothing makes time pass more quickly than reflection.\n\nThis was the more so because Bonacieux's reflections were all\nrose-colored. Rochefort called him his friend, his dear Bonacieux, and\nnever ceased telling him that the cardinal had a great respect for\nhim. The mercer fancied himself already on the high road to honors and\nfortune.\n\nOn her side Mme. Bonacieux had also reflected; but, it must be admitted,\nupon something widely different from ambition. In spite of herself her\nthoughts constantly reverted to that handsome young man who was so brave\nand appeared to be so much in love. Married at eighteen to M. Bonacieux,\nhaving always lived among her husband's friends--people little capable\nof inspiring any sentiment whatever in a young woman whose heart was\nabove her position--Mme. Bonacieux had remained insensible to vulgar\nseductions; but at this period the title of gentleman had great\ninfluence with the citizen class, and d'Artagnan was a gentleman.\nBesides, he wore the uniform of the Guards, which next to that of the\nMusketeers was most admired by the ladies. He was, we repeat, handsome,\nyoung, and bold; he spoke of love like a man who did love and was\nanxious to be loved in return. There was certainly enough in all this\nto turn a head only twenty-three years old, and Mme. Bonacieux had just\nattained that happy period of life.\n\nThe couple, then, although they had not seen each other for eight days,\nand during that time serious events had taken place in which both\nwere concerned, accosted each other with a degree of preoccupation.\nNevertheless, Bonacieux manifested real joy, and advanced toward his\nwife with open arms. Madame Bonacieux presented her cheek to him.\n\n\"Let us talk a little,\" said she.\n\n\"How!\" said Bonacieux, astonished.\n\n\"Yes, I have something of the highest importance to tell you.\"\n\n\"True,\" said he, \"and I have some questions sufficiently serious to put\nto you. Describe to me your abduction, I pray you.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's of no consequence just now,\" said Mme. Bonacieux.\n\n\"And what does it concern, then--my captivity?\"\n\n\"I heard of it the day it happened; but as you were not guilty of any\ncrime, as you were not guilty of any intrigue, as you, in short, knew\nnothing that could compromise yourself or anybody else, I attached no\nmore importance to that event than it merited.\"\n\n\"You speak very much at your ease, madame,\" said Bonacieux, hurt at the\nlittle interest his wife showed in him. \"Do you know that I was plunged\nduring a day and night in a dungeon of the Bastille?\"\n\n\"Oh, a day and night soon pass away. Let us return to the object that\nbrings me here.\"\n\n\"What, that which brings you home to me? Is it not the desire of seeing\na husband again from whom you have been separated for a week?\" asked the\nmercer, piqued to the quick.\n\n\"Yes, that first, and other things afterward.\"\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"It is a thing of the highest interest, and upon which our future\nfortune perhaps depends.\"\n\n\"The complexion of our fortune has changed very much since I saw you,\nMadam Bonacieux, and I should not be astonished if in the course of a\nfew months it were to excite the envy of many folks.\"\n\n\"Yes, particularly if you follow the instructions I am about to give\nyou.\"\n\n\"Me?\"\n\n\"Yes, you. There is good and holy action to be performed, monsieur, and\nmuch money to be gained at the same time.\"\n\nMme. Bonacieux knew that in talking of money to her husband, she took\nhim on his weak side. But a man, were he even a mercer, when he had\ntalked for ten minutes with Cardinal Richelieu, is no longer the same\nman.\n\n\"Much money to be gained?\" said Bonacieux, protruding his lip.\n\n\"Yes, much.\"\n\n\"About how much?\"\n\n\"A thousand pistoles, perhaps.\"\n\n\"What you demand of me is serious, then?\"\n\n\"It is indeed.\"\n\n\"What must be done?\"\n\n\"You must go away immediately. I will give you a paper which you must\nnot part with on any account, and which you will deliver into the proper\nhands.\"\n\n\"And whither am I to go?\"\n\n\"To London.\"\n\n\"I go to London? Go to! You jest! I have no business in London.\"\n\n\"But others wish that you should go there.\"\n\n\"But who are those others? I warn you that I will never again work in\nthe dark, and that I will know not only to what I expose myself, but for\nwhom I expose myself.\"\n\n\"An illustrious person sends you; an illustrious person awaits you. The\nrecompense will exceed your expectations; that is all I promise you.\"\n\n\"More intrigues! Nothing but intrigues! Thank you, madame, I am aware of\nthem now; Monsieur Cardinal has enlightened me on that head.\"\n\n\"The cardinal?\" cried Mme. Bonacieux. \"Have you seen the cardinal?\"\n\n\"He sent for me,\" answered the mercer, proudly.\n\n\"And you responded to his bidding, you imprudent man?\"\n\n\"Well, I can't say I had much choice of going or not going, for I was\ntaken to him between two guards. It is true also, that as I did not\nthen know his Eminence, if I had been able to dispense with the visit, I\nshould have been enchanted.\"\n\n\"He ill-treated you, then; he threatened you?\"\n\n\"He gave me his hand, and called me his friend. His friend! Do you hear\nthat, madame? I am the friend of the great cardinal!\"\n\n\"Of the great cardinal!\"\n\n\"Perhaps you would contest his right to that title, madame?\"\n\n\"I would contest nothing; but I tell you that the favor of a minister is\nephemeral, and that a man must be mad to attach himself to a minister.\nThere are powers above his which do not depend upon a man or the issue\nof an event; it is to these powers we should rally.\"\n\n\"I am sorry for it, madame, but I acknowledge not her power but that of\nthe great man whom I have the honor to serve.\"\n\n\"You serve the cardinal?\"\n\n\"Yes, madame; and as his servant, I will not allow you to be concerned\nin plots against the safety of the state, or to serve the intrigues of a\nwoman who is not French and who has a Spanish heart. Fortunately we have\nthe great cardinal; his vigilant eye watches over and penetrates to the\nbottom of the heart.\"\n\nBonacieux was repeating, word for word, a sentence which he had heard\nfrom the Comte de Rochefort; but the poor wife, who had reckoned on her\nhusband, and who, in that hope, had answered for him to the queen, did\nnot tremble the less, both at the danger into which she had nearly\ncast herself and at the helpless state to which she was reduced.\nNevertheless, knowing the weakness of her husband, and more particularly\nhis cupidity, she did not despair of bringing him round to her purpose.\n\n\"Ah, you are a cardinalist, then, monsieur, are you?\" cried she; \"and\nyou serve the party of those who maltreat your wife and insult your\nqueen?\"\n\n\"Private interests are as nothing before the interests of all. I am for\nthose who save the state,\" said Bonacieux, emphatically.\n\n\"And what do you know about the state you talk of?\" said Mme.\nBonacieux, shrugging her shoulders. \"Be satisfied with being a plain,\nstraightforward citizen, and turn to that side which offers the most\nadvantages.\"\n\n\"Eh, eh!\" said Bonacieux, slapping a plump, round bag, which returned a\nsound a money; \"what do you think of this, Madame Preacher?\"\n\n\"Whence comes that money?\"\n\n\"You do not guess?\"\n\n\"From the cardinal?\"\n\n\"From him, and from my friend the Comte de Rochefort.\"\n\n\"The Comte de Rochefort! Why it was he who carried me off!\"\n\n\"That may be, madame!\"\n\n\"And you receive silver from that man?\"\n\n\"Have you not said that that abduction was entirely political?\"\n\n\"Yes; but that abduction had for its object the betrayal of my mistress,\nto draw from me by torture confessions that might compromise the honor,\nand perhaps the life, of my august mistress.\"\n\n\"Madame,\" replied Bonacieux, \"your august mistress is a perfidious\nSpaniard, and what the cardinal does is well done.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the young woman, \"I know you to be cowardly,\navaricious, and foolish, but I never till now believed you infamous!\"\n\n\"Madame,\" said Bonacieux, who had never seen his wife in a passion, and\nwho recoiled before this conjugal anger, \"madame, what do you say?\"\n\n\"I say you are a miserable creature!\" continued Mme. Bonacieux, who saw\nshe was regaining some little influence over her husband. \"You meddle\nwith politics, do you--and still more, with cardinalist politics? Why,\nyou sell yourself, body and soul, to the demon, the devil, for money!\"\n\n\"No, to the cardinal.\"\n\n\"It's the same thing,\" cried the young woman. \"Who calls Richelieu calls\nSatan.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, hold your tongue, madame! You may be overheard.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are right; I should be ashamed for anyone to know your\nbaseness.\"\n\n\"But what do you require of me, then? Let us see.\"\n\n\"I have told you. You must depart instantly, monsieur. You must\naccomplish loyally the commission with which I deign to charge you, and\non that condition I pardon everything, I forget everything; and what is\nmore,\" and she held out her hand to him, \"I restore my love.\"\n\nBonacieux was cowardly and avaricious, but he loved his wife. He\nwas softened. A man of fifty cannot long bear malice with a wife of\ntwenty-three. Mme. Bonacieux saw that he hesitated.\n\n\"Come! Have you decided?\" said she.\n\n\"But, my dear love, reflect a little upon what you require of me. London\nis far from Paris, very far, and perhaps the commission with which you\ncharge me is not without dangers?\"\n\n\"What matters it, if you avoid them?\"\n\n\"Hold, Madame Bonacieux,\" said the mercer, \"hold! I positively refuse;\nintrigues terrify me. I have seen the Bastille. My! Whew! That's a\nfrightful place, that Bastille! Only to think of it makes my flesh\ncrawl. They threatened me with torture. Do you know what torture is?\nWooden points that they stick in between your legs till your bones\nstick out! No, positively I will not go. And, MORBLEU, why do you not go\nyourself? For in truth, I think I have hitherto been deceived in you. I\nreally believe you are a man, and a violent one, too.\"\n\n\"And you, you are a woman--a miserable woman, stupid and brutal. You are\nafraid, are you? Well, if you do not go this very instant, I will have\nyou arrested by the queen's orders, and I will have you placed in the\nBastille which you dread so much.\"\n\nBonacieux fell into a profound reflection. He weighed the two angers\nin his brain--that of the cardinal and that of the queen; that of the\ncardinal predominated enormously.\n\n\"Have me arrested on the part of the queen,\" said he, \"and I--I will\nappeal to his Eminence.\"\n\nAt once Mme. Bonacieux saw that she had gone too far, and she was\nterrified at having communicated so much. She for a moment contemplated\nwith fright that stupid countenance, impressed with the invincible\nresolution of a fool that is overcome by fear.\n\n\"Well, be it so!\" said she. \"Perhaps, when all is considered, you are\nright. In the long run, a man knows more about politics than a woman,\nparticularly such as, like you, Monsieur Bonacieux, have conversed with\nthe cardinal. And yet it is very hard,\" added she, \"that a man upon\nwhose affection I thought I might depend, treats me thus unkindly and\nwill not comply with any of my fancies.\"\n\n\"That is because your fancies go too far,\" replied the triumphant\nBonacieux, \"and I mistrust them.\"\n\n\"Well, I will give it up, then,\" said the young woman, sighing. \"It is\nwell as it is; say no more about it.\"\n\n\"At least you should tell me what I should have to do in London,\"\nreplied Bonacieux, who remembered a little too late that Rochefort had\ndesired him to endeavor to obtain his wife's secrets.\n\n\"It is of no use for you to know anything about it,\" said the young\nwoman, whom an instinctive mistrust now impelled to draw back. \"It was\nabout one of those purchases that interest women--a purchase by which\nmuch might have been gained.\"\n\nBut the more the young woman excused herself, the more important\nBonacieux thought the secret which she declined to confide to him. He\nresolved then to hasten immediately to the residence of the Comte de\nRochefort, and tell him that the queen was seeking for a messenger to\nsend to London.\n\n\"Pardon me for quitting you, my dear Madame Bonacieux,\" said he; \"but,\nnot knowing you would come to see me, I had made an engagement with a\nfriend. I shall soon return; and if you will wait only a few minutes for\nme, as soon as I have concluded my business with that friend, as it is\ngrowing late, I will come back and reconduct you to the Louvre.\"\n\n\"Thank you, monsieur, you are not brave enough to be of any use to me\nwhatever,\" replied Mme. Bonacieux. \"I shall return very safely to the\nLouvre all alone.\"\n\n\"As you please, Madame Bonacieux,\" said the ex-mercer. \"Shall I see you\nagain soon?\"\n\n\"Next week I hope my duties will afford me a little liberty, and I will\ntake advantage of it to come and put things in order here, as they must\nnecessarily be much deranged.\"\n\n\"Very well; I shall expect you. You are not angry with me?\"\n\n\"Not the least in the world.\"\n\n\"Till then, then?\"\n\n\"Till then.\"\n\nBonacieux kissed his wife's hand, and set off at a quick pace.\n\n\"Well,\" said Mme. Bonacieux, when her husband had shut the street door\nand she found herself alone; \"that imbecile lacked but one thing to\nbecome a cardinalist. And I, who have answered for him to the queen--I,\nwho have promised my poor mistress--ah, my God, my God! She will take me\nfor one of those wretches with whom the palace swarms and who are placed\nabout her as spies! Ah, Monsieur Bonacieux, I never did love you much,\nbut now it is worse than ever. I hate you, and on my word you shall pay\nfor this!\"\n\nAt the moment she spoke these words a rap on the ceiling made her raise\nher head, and a voice which reached her through the ceiling cried, \"Dear\nMadame Bonacieux, open for me the little door on the alley, and I will\ncome down to you.\"\n\n\n\n\n18 LOVER AND HUSBAND\n\n\"Ah, Madame,\" said d'Artagnan, entering by the door which the young\nwoman opened for him, \"allow me to tell you that you have a bad sort of\na husband.\"\n\n\"You have, then, overheard our conversation?\" asked Mme. Bonacieux,\neagerly, and looking at d'Artagnan with disquiet.\n\n\"The whole.\"\n\n\"But how, my God?\"\n\n\"By a mode of proceeding known to myself, and by which I likewise\noverheard the more animated conversation which he had with the\ncardinal's police.\"\n\n\"And what did you understand by what we said?\"\n\n\"A thousand things. In the first place, that, unfortunately, your\nhusband is a simpleton and a fool; in the next place, you are in\ntrouble, of which I am very glad, as it gives me a opportunity of\nplacing myself at your service, and God knows I am ready to throw\nmyself into the fire for you; finally, that the queen wants a brave,\nintelligent, devoted man to make a journey to London for her. I have at\nleast two of the three qualities you stand in need of, and here I am.\"\n\nMme. Bonacieux made no reply; but her heart beat with joy and secret\nhope shone in her eyes.\n\n\"And what guarantee will you give me,\" asked she, \"if I consent to\nconfide this message to you?\"\n\n\"My love for you. Speak! Command! What is to be done?\"\n\n\"My God, my God!\" murmured the young woman, \"ought I to confide such a\nsecret to you, monsieur? You are almost a boy.\"\n\n\"I see that you require someone to answer for me?\"\n\n\"I admit that would reassure me greatly.\"\n\n\"Do you know Athos?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Porthos?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Aramis?\"\n\n\"No. Who are these gentleman?\"\n\n\"Three of the king's Musketeers. Do you know Monsieur de Treville, their\ncaptain?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, him! I know him; not personally, but from having heard the\nqueen speak of him more than once as a brave and loyal gentleman.\"\n\n\"You do not fear lest he should betray you to the cardinal?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, certainly not!\"\n\n\"Well, reveal your secret to him, and ask him whether, however\nimportant, however valuable, however terrible it may be, you may not\nconfide it to me.\"\n\n\"But this secret is not mine, and I cannot reveal it in this manner.\"\n\n\"You were about to confide it to Monsieur Bonacieux,\" said d'Artagnan,\nwith chagrin.\n\n\"As one confides a letter to the hollow of a tree, to the wing of a\npigeon, to the collar of a dog.\"\n\n\"And yet, me--you see plainly that I love you.\"\n\n\"You say so.\"\n\n\"I am an honorable man.\"\n\n\"You say so.\"\n\n\"I am a gallant fellow.\"\n\n\"I believe it.\"\n\n\"I am brave.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am sure of that!\"\n\n\"Then, put me to the proof.\"\n\nMme. Bonacieux looked at the young man, restrained for a minute by\na last hesitation; but there was such an ardor in his eyes, such\npersuasion in his voice, that she felt herself constrained to confide in\nhim. Besides, she found herself in circumstances where everything must\nbe risked for the sake of everything. The queen might be as much injured\nby too much reticence as by too much confidence; and--let us admit\nit--the involuntary sentiment which she felt for her young protector\ndecided her to speak.\n\n\"Listen,\" said she; \"I yield to your protestations, I yield to your\nassurances. But I swear to you, before God who hears us, that if you\nbetray me, and my enemies pardon me, I will kill myself, while accusing\nyou of my death.\"\n\n\"And I--I swear to you before God, madame,\" said d'Artagnan, \"that if I\nam taken while accomplishing the orders you give me, I will die sooner\nthan do anything that may compromise anyone.\"\n\nThen the young woman confided in him the terrible secret of which chance\nhad already communicated to him a part in front of the Samaritaine. This\nwas their mutual declaration of love.\n\nD'Artagnan was radiant with joy and pride. This secret which he\npossessed, this woman whom he loved! Confidence and love made him a\ngiant.\n\n\"I go,\" said he; \"I go at once.\"\n\n\"How, you will go!\" said Mme. Bonacieux; \"and your regiment, your\ncaptain?\"\n\n\"By my soul, you had made me forget all that, dear Constance! Yes, you\nare right; a furlough is needful.\"\n\n\"Still another obstacle,\" murmured Mme. Bonacieux, sorrowfully.\n\n\"As to that,\" cried d'Artagnan, after a moment of reflection, \"I shall\nsurmount it, be assured.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"I will go this very evening to Treville, whom I will request to ask\nthis favor for me of his brother-in-law, Monsieur Dessessart.\"\n\n\"But another thing.\"\n\n\"What?\" asked d'Artagnan, seeing that Mme. Bonacieux hesitated to\ncontinue.\n\n\"You have, perhaps, no money?\"\n\n\"PERHAPS is too much,\" said d'Artagnan, smiling.\n\n\"Then,\" replied Mme. Bonacieux, opening a cupboard and taking from\nit the very bag which a half hour before her husband had caressed so\naffectionately, \"take this bag.\"\n\n\"The cardinal's?\" cried d'Artagnan, breaking into a loud laugh, he\nhaving heard, as may be remembered, thanks to the broken boards, every\nsyllable of the conversation between the mercer and his wife.\n\n\"The cardinal's,\" replied Mme. Bonacieux. \"You see it makes a very\nrespectable appearance.\"\n\n\"PARDIEU,\" cried d'Artagnan, \"it will be a double amusing affair to save\nthe queen with the cardinal's money!\"\n\n\"You are an amiable and charming young man,\" said Mme. Bonacieux. \"Be\nassured you will not find her Majesty ungrateful.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am already grandly recompensed!\" cried d'Artagnan. \"I love you;\nyou permit me to tell you that I do--that is already more happiness than\nI dared to hope.\"\n\n\"Silence!\" said Mme. Bonacieux, starting.\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"Someone is talking in the street.\"\n\n\"It is the voice of--\"\n\n\"Of my husband! Yes, I recognize it!\"\n\nD'Artagnan ran to the door and pushed the bolt.\n\n\"He shall not come in before I am gone,\" said he; \"and when I am gone,\nyou can open to him.\"\n\n\"But I ought to be gone, too. And the disappearance of his money; how am\nI to justify it if I am here?\"\n\n\"You are right; we must go out.\"\n\n\"Go out? How? He will see us if we go out.\"\n\n\"Then you must come up into my room.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Mme. Bonacieux, \"you speak that in a tone that frightens me!\"\n\nMme. Bonacieux pronounced these words with tears in her eyes. d'Artagnan\nsaw those tears, and much disturbed, softened, he threw himself at her\nfeet.\n\n\"With me you will be as safe as in a temple; I give you my word of a\ngentleman.\"\n\n\"Let us go,\" said she, \"I place full confidence in you, my friend!\"\n\nD'Artagnan drew back the bolt with precaution, and both, light as\nshadows, glided through the interior door into the passage, ascended the\nstairs as quietly as possible, and entered d'Artagnan's chambers.\n\nOnce there, for greater security, the young man barricaded the door.\nThey both approached the window, and through a slit in the shutter they\nsaw Bonacieux talking with a man in a cloak.\n\nAt sight of this man, d'Artagnan started, and half drawing his sword,\nsprang toward the door.\n\nIt was the man of Meung.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" cried Mme. Bonacieux; \"you will ruin us\nall!\"\n\n\"But I have sworn to kill that man!\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Your life is devoted from this moment, and does not belong to you.\nIn the name of the queen I forbid you to throw yourself into any peril\nwhich is foreign to that of your journey.\"\n\n\"And do you command nothing in your own name?\"\n\n\"In my name,\" said Mme. Bonacieux, with great emotion, \"in my name I beg\nyou! But listen; they appear to be speaking of me.\"\n\nD'Artagnan drew near the window, and lent his ear.\n\nM. Bonacieux had opened his door, and seeing the apartment, had returned\nto the man in the cloak, whom he had left alone for an instant.\n\n\"She is gone,\" said he; \"she must have returned to the Louvre.\"\n\n\"You are sure,\" replied the stranger, \"that she did not suspect the\nintentions with which you went out?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Bonacieux, with a self-sufficient air, \"she is too\nsuperficial a woman.\"\n\n\"Is the young Guardsman at home?\"\n\n\"I do not think he is; as you see, his shutter is closed, and you can\nsee no light shine through the chinks of the shutters.\"\n\n\"All the same, it is well to be certain.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"By knocking at his door. Go.\"\n\n\"I will ask his servant.\"\n\nBonacieux re-entered the house, passed through the same door that had\nafforded a passage for the two fugitives, went up to d'Artagnan's door,\nand knocked.\n\nNo one answered. Porthos, in order to make a greater display, had that\nevening borrowed Planchet. As to d'Artagnan, he took care not to give\nthe least sign of existence.\n\nThe moment the hand of Bonacieux sounded on the door, the two young\npeople felt their hearts bound within them.\n\n\"There is nobody within,\" said Bonacieux.\n\n\"Never mind. Let us return to your apartment. We shall be safer there\nthan in the doorway.\"\n\n\"Ah, my God!\" whispered Mme. Bonacieux, \"we shall hear no more.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" said d'Artagnan, \"we shall hear better.\"\n\nD'Artagnan raised the three or four boards which made his chamber\nanother ear of Dionysius, spread a carpet on the floor, went upon his\nknees, and made a sign to Mme. Bonacieux to stoop as he did toward the\nopening.\n\n\"You are sure there is nobody there?\" said the stranger.\n\n\"I will answer for it,\" said Bonacieux.\n\n\"And you think that your wife--\"\n\n\"Has returned to the Louvre.\"\n\n\"Without speaking to anyone but yourself?\"\n\n\"I am sure of it.\"\n\n\"That is an important point, do you understand?\"\n\n\"Then the news I brought you is of value?\"\n\n\"The greatest, my dear Bonacieux; I don't conceal this from you.\"\n\n\"Then the cardinal will be pleased with me?\"\n\n\"I have no doubt of it.\"\n\n\"The great cardinal!\"\n\n\"Are you sure, in her conversation with you, that your wife mentioned no\nnames?\"\n\n\"I think not.\"\n\n\"She did not name Madame de Chevreuse, the Duke of Buckingham, or Madame\nde Vernet?\"\n\n\"No; she only told me she wished to send me to London to serve the\ninterests of an illustrious personage.\"\n\n\"The traitor!\" murmured Mme. Bonacieux.\n\n\"Silence!\" said d'Artagnan, taking her hand, which, without thinking of\nit, she abandoned to him.\n\n\"Never mind,\" continued the man in the cloak; \"you were a fool not\nto have pretended to accept the mission. You would then be in present\npossession of the letter. The state, which is now threatened, would be\nsafe, and you--\"\n\n\"And I?\"\n\n\"Well you--the cardinal would have given you letters of nobility.\"\n\n\"Did he tell you so?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know that he meant to afford you that agreeable surprise.\"\n\n\"Be satisfied,\" replied Bonacieux; \"my wife adores me, and there is yet\ntime.\"\n\n\"The ninny!\" murmured Mme. Bonacieux.\n\n\"Silence!\" said d'Artagnan, pressing her hand more closely.\n\n\"How is there still time?\" asked the man in the cloak.\n\n\"I go to the Louvre; I ask for Mme. Bonacieux; I say that I have\nreflected; I renew the affair; I obtain the letter, and I run directly\nto the cardinal.\"\n\n\"Well, go quickly! I will return soon to learn the result of your trip.\"\n\nThe stranger went out.\n\n\"Infamous!\" said Mme. Bonacieux, addressing this epithet to her husband.\n\n\"Silence!\" said d'Artagnan, pressing her hand still more warmly.\n\nA terrible howling interrupted these reflections of d'Artagnan and Mme.\nBonacieux. It was her husband, who had discovered the disappearance of\nthe moneybag, and was crying \"Thieves!\"\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" cried Mme. Bonacieux, \"he will rouse the whole quarter.\"\n\nBonacieux called a long time; but as such cries, on account of their\nfrequency, brought nobody in the Rue des Fossoyeurs, and as lately the\nmercer's house had a bad name, finding that nobody came, he went out\ncontinuing to call, his voice being heard fainter and fainter as he went\nin the direction of the Rue du Bac.\n\n\"Now he is gone, it is your turn to get out,\" said Mme. Bonacieux.\n\"Courage, my friend, but above all, prudence, and think what you owe to\nthe queen.\"\n\n\"To her and to you!\" cried d'Artagnan. \"Be satisfied, beautiful\nConstance. I shall become worthy of her gratitude; but shall I likewise\nreturn worthy of your love?\"\n\nThe young woman only replied by the beautiful glow which mounted to her\ncheeks. A few seconds afterward d'Artagnan also went out enveloped in a\nlarge cloak, which ill-concealed the sheath of a long sword.\n\nMme. Bonacieux followed him with her eyes, with that long, fond look\nwith which he had turned the angle of the street, she fell on her knees,\nand clasping her hands, \"Oh, my God,\" cried she, \"protect the queen,\nprotect me!\"\n\n\n\n\n19 PLAN OF CAMPAIGN\n\nD'Artagnan went straight to M. de Treville's. He had reflected that in\na few minutes the cardinal would be warned by this cursed stranger,\nwho appeared to be his agent, and he judged, with reason, he had not a\nmoment to lose.\n\nThe heart of the young man overflowed with joy. An opportunity presented\nitself to him in which there would be at the same time glory to be\nacquired, and money to be gained; and as a far higher encouragement, it\nbrought him into close intimacy with a woman he adored. This chance\ndid, then, for him at once more than he would have dared to ask of\nProvidence.\n\nM. de Treville was in his saloon with his habitual court of gentlemen.\nD'Artagnan, who was known as a familiar of the house, went straight\nto his office, and sent word that he wished to see him on something of\nimportance.\n\nD'Artagnan had been there scarcely five minutes when M. de Treville\nentered. At the first glance, and by the joy which was painted on his\ncountenance, the worthy captain plainly perceived that something new was\non foot.\n\nAll the way along d'Artagnan had been consulting with himself whether he\nshould place confidence in M. de Treville, or whether he should only ask\nhim to give him CARTE BLANCHE for some secret affair. But M. de Treville\nhad always been so thoroughly his friend, had always been so devoted to\nthe king and queen, and hated the cardinal so cordially, that the young\nman resolved to tell him everything.\n\n\"Did you ask for me, my good friend?\" said M. de Treville.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" said d'Artagnan, lowering his voice, \"and you will\npardon me, I hope, for having disturbed you when you know the importance\nof my business.\"\n\n\"Speak, then, I am all attention.\"\n\n\"It concerns nothing less,\" said d'Artagnan, \"than the honor, perhaps\nthe life of the queen.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" asked M. de Treville, glancing round to see if they\nwere surely alone, and then fixing his questioning look upon d'Artagnan.\n\n\"I say, monsieur, that chance has rendered me master of a secret--\"\n\n\"Which you will guard, I hope, young man, as your life.\"\n\n\"But which I must impart to you, monsieur, for you alone can assist me\nin the mission I have just received from her Majesty.\"\n\n\"Is this secret your own?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur; it is her Majesty's.\"\n\n\"Are you authorized by her Majesty to communicate it to me?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur, for, on the contrary, I am desired to preserve the\nprofoundest mystery.\"\n\n\"Why, then, are you about to betray it to me?\"\n\n\"Because, as I said, without you I can do nothing; and I am afraid you\nwill refuse me the favor I come to ask if you do not know to what end I\nask it.\"\n\n\"Keep your secret, young man, and tell me what you wish.\"\n\n\"I wish you to obtain for me, from Monsieur Dessessart, leave of absence\nfor fifteen days.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"This very night.\"\n\n\"You leave Paris?\"\n\n\"I am going on a mission.\"\n\n\"May you tell me whither?\"\n\n\"To London.\"\n\n\"Has anyone an interest in preventing your arrival there?\"\n\n\"The cardinal, I believe, would give the world to prevent my success.\"\n\n\"And you are going alone?\"\n\n\"I am going alone.\"\n\n\"In that case you will not get beyond Bondy. I tell you so, by the faith\nof de Treville.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"You will be assassinated.\"\n\n\"And I shall die in the performance of my duty.\"\n\n\"But your mission will not be accomplished.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" replied d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Believe me,\" continued Treville, \"in enterprises of this kind, in order\nthat one may arrive, four must set out.\"\n\n\"Ah, you are right, monsieur,\" said d'Artagnan; \"but you know Athos,\nPorthos, and Aramis, and you know if I can dispose of them.\"\n\n\"Without confiding to them the secret which I am not willing to know?\"\n\n\"We are sworn, once for all, to implicit confidence and devotedness\nagainst all proof. Besides, you can tell them that you have full\nconfidence in me, and they will not be more incredulous than you.\"\n\n\"I can send to each of them leave of absence for fifteen days, that is\nall--to Athos, whose wound still makes him suffer, to go to the waters\nof Forges; to Porthos and Aramis to accompany their friend, whom they\nare not willing to abandon in such a painful condition. Sending their\nleave of absence will be proof enough that I authorize their journey.\"\n\n\"Thanks, monsieur. You are a hundred times too good.\"\n\n\"Begone, then, find them instantly, and let all be done tonight! Ha! But\nfirst write your request to Dessessart. Perhaps you had a spy at your\nheels; and your visit, if it should ever be known to the cardinal, will\nthus seem legitimate.\"\n\nD'Artagnan drew up his request, and M. de Treville, on receiving it,\nassured him that by two o'clock in the morning the four leaves of\nabsence should be at the respective domiciles of the travelers.\n\n\"Have the goodness to send mine to Athos's residence. I should dread\nsome disagreeable encounter if I were to go home.\"\n\n\"Be easy. Adieu, and a prosperous voyage. A PROPOS,\" said M. de\nTreville, calling him back.\n\nD'Artagnan returned.\n\n\"Have you any money?\"\n\nD'Artagnan tapped the bag he had in his pocket.\n\n\"Enough?\" asked M. de Treville.\n\n\"Three hundred pistoles.\"\n\n\"Oh, plenty! That would carry you to the end of the world. Begone,\nthen!\"\n\nD'Artagnan saluted M. de Treville, who held out his hand to him;\nd'Artagnan pressed it with a respect mixed with gratitude. Since his\nfirst arrival at Paris, he had had constant occasion to honor this\nexcellent man, whom he had always found worthy, loyal, and great.\n\nHis first visit was to Aramis, at whose residence he had not been\nsince the famous evening on which he had followed Mme. Bonacieux. Still\nfurther, he had seldom seen the young Musketeer; but every time he had\nseen him, he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his countenance.\n\nThis evening, especially, Aramis was melancholy and thoughtful.\nd'Artagnan asked some questions about this prolonged melancholy. Aramis\npleaded as his excuse a commentary upon the eighteenth chapter of St.\nAugustine, which he was forced to write in Latin for the following week,\nand which preoccupied him a good deal.\n\nAfter the two friends had been chatting a few moments, a servant from M.\nde Treville entered, bringing a sealed packet.\n\n\"What is that?\" asked Aramis.\n\n\"The leave of absence Monsieur has asked for,\" replied the lackey.\n\n\"For me! I have asked for no leave of absence.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue and take it!\" said d'Artagnan. \"And you, my friend,\nthere is a demipistole for your trouble; you will tell Monsieur de\nTreville that Monsieur Aramis is very much obliged to him. Go.\"\n\nThe lackey bowed to the ground and departed.\n\n\"What does all this mean?\" asked Aramis.\n\n\"Pack up all you want for a journey of a fortnight, and follow me.\"\n\n\"But I cannot leave Paris just now without knowing--\"\n\nAramis stopped.\n\n\"What is become of her? I suppose you mean--\" continued d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Become of whom?\" replied Aramis.\n\n\"The woman who was here--the woman with the embroidered handkerchief.\"\n\n\"Who told you there was a woman here?\" replied Aramis, becoming as pale\nas death.\n\n\"I saw her.\"\n\n\"And you know who she is?\"\n\n\"I believe I can guess, at least.\"\n\n\"Listen!\" said Aramis. \"Since you appear to know so many things, can you\ntell me what is become of that woman?\"\n\n\"I presume that she has returned to Tours.\"\n\n\"To Tours? Yes, that may be. You evidently know her. But why did she\nreturn to Tours without telling me anything?\"\n\n\"Because she was in fear of being arrested.\"\n\n\"Why has she not written to me, then?\"\n\n\"Because she was afraid of compromising you.\"\n\n\"d'Artagnan, you restore me to life!\" cried Aramis. \"I fancied myself\ndespised, betrayed. I was so delighted to see her again! I could not\nhave believed she would risk her liberty for me, and yet for what other\ncause could she have returned to Paris?\"\n\n\"For the cause which today takes us to England.\"\n\n\"And what is this cause?\" demanded Aramis.\n\n\"Oh, you'll know it someday, Aramis; but at present I must imitate the\ndiscretion of 'the doctor's niece.'\"\n\nAramis smiled, as he remembered the tale he had told his friends on a\ncertain evening. \"Well, then, since she has left Paris, and you are sure\nof it, d'Artagnan, nothing prevents me, and I am ready to follow you.\nYou say we are going--\"\n\n\"To see Athos now, and if you will come thither, I beg you to make\nhaste, for we have lost much time already. A PROPOS, inform Bazin.\"\n\n\"Will Bazin go with us?\" asked Aramis.\n\n\"Perhaps so. At all events, it is best that he should follow us to\nAthos's.\"\n\nAramis called Bazin, and, after having ordered him to join them at\nAthos's residence, said \"Let us go then,\" at the same time taking his\ncloak, sword, and three pistols, opening uselessly two or three drawers\nto see if he could not find stray coin. When well assured this search\nwas superfluous, he followed d'Artagnan, wondering to himself how this\nyoung Guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had\ngiven hospitality, and that he should know better than himself what had\nbecome of her.\n\nOnly as they went out Aramis placed his hand upon the arm of d'Artagnan,\nand looking at him earnestly, \"You have not spoken of this lady?\" said\nhe.\n\n\"To nobody in the world.\"\n\n\"Not even to Athos or Porthos?\"\n\n\"I have not breathed a syllable to them.\"\n\n\"Good enough!\"\n\nTranquil on this important point, Aramis continued his way with\nd'Artagnan, and both soon arrived at Athos's dwelling. They found him\nholding his leave of absence in one hand, and M. de Treville's note in\nthe other.\n\n\"Can you explain to me what signify this leave of absence and this\nletter, which I have just received?\" said the astonished Athos.\n\n\nMy dear Athos,\n\nI wish, as your health absolutely requires it, that you should rest for\na fortnight. Go, then, and take the waters of Forges, or any that may be\nmore agreeable to you, and recuperate yourself as quickly as possible.\n\nYours affectionate,\n\nde Treville\n\n\n\"Well, this leave of absence and that letter mean that you must follow\nme, Athos.\"\n\n\"To the waters of Forges?\"\n\n\"There or elsewhere.\"\n\n\"In the king's service?\"\n\n\"Either the king's or the queen's. Are we not their Majesties'\nservants?\"\n\nAt that moment Porthos entered. \"PARDIEU!\" said he, \"here is a strange\nthing! Since when, I wonder, in the Musketeers, did they grant men leave\nof absence without their asking for it?\"\n\n\"Since,\" said d'Artagnan, \"they have friends who ask it for them.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" said Porthos, \"it appears there's something fresh here.\"\n\n\"Yes, we are going--\" said Aramis.\n\n\"To what country?\" demanded Porthos.\n\n\"My faith! I don't know much about it,\" said Athos. \"Ask d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"To London, gentlemen,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"To London!\" cried Porthos; \"and what the devil are we going to do in\nLondon?\"\n\n\"That is what I am not at liberty to tell you, gentlemen; you must trust\nto me.\"\n\n\"But in order to go to London,\" added Porthos, \"money is needed, and I\nhave none.\"\n\n\"Nor I,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Nor I,\" said Athos.\n\n\"I have,\" replied d'Artagnan, pulling out his treasure from his pocket,\nand placing it on the table. \"There are in this bag three hundred\npistoles. Let each take seventy-five; that is enough to take us to\nLondon and back. Besides, make yourselves easy; we shall not all arrive\nat London.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because, in all probability, some one of us will be left on the road.\"\n\n\"Is this, then, a campaign upon which we are now entering?\"\n\n\"One of a most dangerous kind, I give you notice.\"\n\n\"Ah! But if we do risk being killed,\" said Porthos, \"at least I should\nlike to know what for.\"\n\n\"You would be all the wiser,\" said Athos.\n\n\"And yet,\" said Aramis, \"I am somewhat of Porthos's opinion.\"\n\n\"Is the king accustomed to give you such reasons? No. He says to you\njauntily, 'Gentlemen, there is fighting going on in Gascony or in\nFlanders; go and fight,' and you go there. Why? You need give yourselves\nno more uneasiness about this.\"\n\n\"d'Artagnan is right,\" said Athos; \"here are our three leaves of\nabsence which came from Monsieur de Treville, and here are three hundred\npistoles which came from I don't know where. So let us go and get killed\nwhere we are told to go. Is life worth the trouble of so many questions?\nD'Artagnan, I am ready to follow you.\"\n\n\"And I also,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"And I also,\" said Aramis. \"And, indeed, I am not sorry to quit Paris; I\nhad need of distraction.\"\n\n\"Well, you will have distractions enough, gentlemen, be assured,\" said\nd'Artagnan.\n\n\"And, now, when are we to go?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"Immediately,\" replied d'Artagnan; \"we have not a minute to lose.\"\n\n\"Hello, Grimaud! Planchet! Mousqueton! Bazin!\" cried the four young men,\ncalling their lackeys, \"clean my boots, and fetch the horses from the\nhotel.\"\n\nEach Musketeer was accustomed to leave at the general hotel, as at\na barrack, his own horse and that of his lackey. Planchet, Grimaud,\nMousqueton, and Bazin set off at full speed.\n\n\"Now let us lay down the plan of campaign,\" said Porthos. \"Where do we\ngo first?\"\n\n\"To Calais,\" said d'Artagnan; \"that is the most direct line to London.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Porthos, \"this is my advice--\"\n\n\"Speak!\"\n\n\"Four men traveling together would be suspected. D'Artagnan will give\neach of us his instructions. I will go by the way of Boulogne to clear\nthe way; Athos will set out two hours after, by that of Amiens; Aramis\nwill follow us by that of Noyon; as to d'Artagnan, he will go by what\nroute he thinks is best, in Planchet's clothes, while Planchet will\nfollow us like d'Artagnan, in the uniform of the Guards.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Athos, \"my opinion is that it is not proper to allow\nlackeys to have anything to do in such an affair. A secret may, by\nchance, be betrayed by gentlemen; but it is almost always sold by\nlackeys.\"\n\n\"Porthos's plan appears to me to be impracticable,\" said d'Artagnan,\n\"inasmuch as I am myself ignorant of what instructions I can give you.\nI am the bearer of a letter, that is all. I have not, and I cannot make\nthree copies of that letter, because it is sealed. We must, then, as it\nappears to me, travel in company. This letter is here, in this pocket,\"\nand he pointed to the pocket which contained the letter. \"If I should\nbe killed, one of you must take it, and continue the route; if he be\nkilled, it will be another's turn, and so on--provided a single one\narrives, that is all that is required.\"\n\n\"Bravo, d'Artagnan, your opinion is mine,\" cried Athos, \"Besides, we\nmust be consistent; I am going to take the waters, you will accompany\nme. Instead of taking the waters of Forges, I go and take sea waters; I\nam free to do so. If anyone wishes to stop us, I will show Monsieur de\nTreville's letter, and you will show your leaves of absence. If we are\nattacked, we will defend ourselves; if we are tried, we will stoutly\nmaintain that we were only anxious to dip ourselves a certain number of\ntimes in the sea. They would have an easy bargain of four isolated men;\nwhereas four men together make a troop. We will arm our four lackeys\nwith pistols and musketoons; if they send an army out against us, we\nwill give battle, and the survivor, as d'Artagnan says, will carry the\nletter.\"\n\n\"Well said,\" cried Aramis; \"you don't often speak, Athos, but when you\ndo speak, it is like St. John of the Golden Mouth. I agree to Athos's\nplan. And you, Porthos?\"\n\n\"I agree to it, too,\" said Porthos, \"if d'Artagnan approves of it.\nD'Artagnan, being the bearer of the letter, is naturally the head of the\nenterprise; let him decide, and we will execute.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said d'Artagnan, \"I decide that we should adopt Athos's plan,\nand that we set off in half an hour.\"\n\n\"Agreed!\" shouted the three Musketeers in chorus.\n\nEach one, stretching out his hand to the bag, took his seventy-five\npistoles, and made his preparations to set out at the time appointed.\n\n\n\n\n20 THE JOURNEY\n\nAt two o'clock in the morning, our four adventurers left Paris by the\nBarriere St. Denis. As long as it was dark they remained silent; in\nspite of themselves they submitted to the influence of the obscurity,\nand apprehended ambushes on every side.\n\nWith the first rays of day their tongues were loosened; with the sun\ngaiety revived. It was like the eve of a battle; the heart beat, the\neyes laughed, and they felt that the life they were perhaps going to\nlose, was, after all, a good thing.\n\nBesides, the appearance of the caravan was formidable. The black horses\nof the Musketeers, their martial carriage, with the regimental step\nof these noble companions of the soldier, would have betrayed the most\nstrict incognito. The lackeys followed, armed to the teeth.\n\nAll went well till they arrived at Chantilly, which they reached about\neight o'clock in the morning. They needed breakfast, and alighted at the\ndoor of an AUBERGE, recommended by a sign representing St. Martin giving\nhalf his cloak to a poor man. They ordered the lackeys not to unsaddle\nthe horses, and to hold themselves in readiness to set off again\nimmediately.\n\nThey entered the common hall, and placed themselves at table. A\ngentleman, who had just arrived by the route of Dammartin, was seated at\nthe same table, and was breakfasting. He opened the conversation about\nrain and fine weather; the travelers replied. He drank to their good\nhealth, and the travelers returned his politeness.\n\nBut at the moment Mousqueton came to announce that the horses were\nready, and they were arising from table, the stranger proposed to\nPorthos to drink the health of the cardinal. Porthos replied that he\nasked no better if the stranger, in his turn, would drink the health of\nthe king. The stranger cried that he acknowledged no other king but his\nEminence. Porthos called him drunk, and the stranger drew his sword.\n\n\"You have committed a piece of folly,\" said Athos, \"but it can't be\nhelped; there is no drawing back. Kill the fellow, and rejoin us as soon\nas you can.\"\n\nAll three remounted their horses, and set out at a good pace, while\nPorthos was promising his adversary to perforate him with all the\nthrusts known in the fencing schools.\n\n\"There goes one!\" cried Athos, at the end of five hundred paces.\n\n\"But why did that man attack Porthos rather than any other one of us?\"\nasked Aramis.\n\n\"Because, as Porthos was talking louder than the rest of us, he took him\nfor the chief,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"I always said that this cadet from Gascony was a well of wisdom,\"\nmurmured Athos; and the travelers continued their route.\n\nAt Beauvais they stopped two hours, as well to breathe their horses a\nlittle as to wait for Porthos. At the end of two hours, as Porthos did\nnot come, not any news of him, they resumed their journey.\n\nAt a league from Beauvais, where the road was confined between two high\nbanks, they fell in with eight or ten men who, taking advantage of the\nroad being unpaved in this spot, appeared to be employed in digging\nholes and filling up the ruts with mud.\n\nAramis, not liking to soil his boots with this artificial mortar,\napostrophized them rather sharply. Athos wished to restrain him, but\nit was too late. The laborers began to jeer the travelers and by their\ninsolence disturbed the equanimity even of the cool Athos, who urged on\nhis horse against one of them.\n\nThen each of these men retreated as far as the ditch, from which each\ntook a concealed musket; the result was that our seven travelers were\noutnumbered in weapons. Aramis received a ball which passed through his\nshoulder, and Mousqueton another ball which lodged in the fleshy part\nwhich prolongs the lower portion of the loins. Therefore Mousqueton\nalone fell from his horse, not because he was severely wounded, but not\nbeing able to see the wound, he judged it to be more serious than it\nreally was.\n\n\"It was an ambuscade!\" shouted d'Artagnan. \"Don't waste a charge!\nForward!\"\n\nAramis, wounded as he was, seized the mane of his horse, which carried\nhim on with the others. Mousqueton's horse rejoined them, and galloped\nby the side of his companions.\n\n\"That will serve us for a relay,\" said Athos.\n\n\"I would rather have had a hat,\" said d'Artagnan. \"Mine was carried away\nby a ball. By my faith, it is very fortunate that the letter was not in\nit.\"\n\n\"They'll kill poor Porthos when he comes up,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"If Porthos were on his legs, he would have rejoined us by this time,\"\nsaid Athos. \"My opinion is that on the ground the drunken man was not\nintoxicated.\"\n\nThey continued at their best speed for two hours, although the horses\nwere so fatigued that it was to be feared they would soon refuse\nservice.\n\nThe travelers had chosen crossroads in the hope that they might meet\nwith less interruption; but at Crevecoeur, Aramis declared he could\nproceed no farther. In fact, it required all the courage which he\nconcealed beneath his elegant form and polished manners to bear him so\nfar. He grew more pale every minute, and they were obliged to support\nhim on his horse. They lifted him off at the door of a cabaret, left\nBazin with him, who, besides, in a skirmish was more embarrassing than\nuseful, and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at Amiens.\n\n\"MORBLEU,\" said Athos, as soon as they were again in motion, \"reduced to\ntwo masters and Grimaud and Planchet! MORBLEU! I won't be their dupe,\nI will answer for it. I will neither open my mouth nor draw my sword\nbetween this and Calais. I swear by--\"\n\n\"Don't waste time in swearing,\" said d'Artagnan; \"let us gallop, if our\nhorses will consent.\"\n\nAnd the travelers buried their rowels in their horses' flanks, who thus\nvigorously stimulated recovered their energies. They arrived at Amiens\nat midnight, and alighted at the AUBERGE of the Golden Lily.\n\nThe host had the appearance of as honest a man as any on earth. He\nreceived the travelers with his candlestick in one hand and his cotton\nnightcap in the other. He wished to lodge the two travelers each in a\ncharming chamber; but unfortunately these charming chambers were at the\nopposite extremities of the hotel. d'Artagnan and Athos refused them.\nThe host replied that he had no other worthy of their Excellencies; but\nthe travelers declared they would sleep in the common chamber, each on\na mattress which might be thrown upon the ground. The host insisted; but\nthe travelers were firm, and he was obliged to do as they wished.\n\nThey had just prepared their beds and barricaded their door within, when\nsomeone knocked at the yard shutter; they demanded who was there, and\nrecognizing the voices of their lackeys, opened the shutter. It was\nindeed Planchet and Grimaud.\n\n\"Grimaud can take care of the horses,\" said Planchet. \"If you are\nwilling, gentlemen, I will sleep across your doorway, and you will then\nbe certain that nobody can reach you.\"\n\n\"And on what will you sleep?\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Here is my bed,\" replied Planchet, producing a bundle of straw.\n\n\"Come, then,\" said d'Artagnan, \"you are right. Mine host's face does not\nplease me at all; it is too gracious.\"\n\n\"Nor me either,\" said Athos.\n\nPlanchet mounted by the window and installed himself across the doorway,\nwhile Grimaud went and shut himself up in the stable, undertaking that\nby five o'clock in the morning he and the four horses should be ready.\n\nThe night was quiet enough. Toward two o'clock in the morning somebody\nendeavored to open the door; but as Planchet awoke in an instant and\ncried, \"Who goes there?\" somebody replied that he was mistaken, and went\naway.\n\nAt four o'clock in the morning they heard a terrible riot in the\nstables. Grimaud had tried to waken the stable boys, and the stable boys\nhad beaten him. When they opened the window, they saw the poor lad lying\nsenseless, with his head split by a blow with a pitchfork.\n\nPlanchet went down into the yard, and wished to saddle the horses; but\nthe horses were all used up. Mousqueton's horse which had traveled for\nfive or six hours without a rider the day before, might have been able\nto pursue the journey; but by an inconceivable error the veterinary\nsurgeon, who had been sent for, as it appeared, to bleed one of the\nhost's horses, had bled Mousqueton's.\n\nThis began to be annoying. All these successive accidents were perhaps\nthe result of chance; but they might be the fruits of a plot. Athos and\nd'Artagnan went out, while Planchet was sent to inquire if there were\nnot three horses for sale in the neighborhood. At the door stood two\nhorses, fresh, strong, and fully equipped. These would just have suited\nthem. He asked where their masters were, and was informed that they had\npassed the night in the inn, and were then settling their bill with the\nhost.\n\nAthos went down to pay the reckoning, while d'Artagnan and Planchet\nstood at the street door. The host was in a lower and back room, to\nwhich Athos was requested to go.\n\nAthos entered without the least mistrust, and took out two pistoles to\npay the bill. The host was alone, seated before his desk, one of the\ndrawers of which was partly open. He took the money which Athos offered\nto him, and after turning and turning it over and over in his hands,\nsuddenly cried out that it was bad, and that he would have him and his\ncompanions arrested as forgers.\n\n\"You blackguard!\" cried Athos, going toward him, \"I'll cut your ears\noff!\"\n\nAt the same instant, four men, armed to the teeth, entered by side\ndoors, and rushed upon Athos.\n\n\"I am taken!\" shouted Athos, with all the power of his lungs. \"Go on,\nd'Artagnan! Spur, spur!\" and he fired two pistols.\n\nD'Artagnan and Planchet did not require twice bidding; they unfastened\nthe two horses that were waiting at the door, leaped upon them, buried\ntheir spurs in their sides, and set off at full gallop.\n\n\"Do you know what has become of Athos?\" asked d'Artagnan of Planchet, as\nthey galloped on.\n\n\"Ah, monsieur,\" said Planchet, \"I saw one fall at each of his two shots,\nand he appeared to me, through the glass door, to be fighting with his\nsword with the others.\"\n\n\"Brave Athos!\" murmured d'Artagnan, \"and to think that we are compelled\nto leave him; maybe the same fate awaits us two paces hence. Forward,\nPlanchet, forward! You are a brave fellow.\"\n\n\"As I told you, monsieur,\" replied Planchet, \"Picards are found out by\nbeing used. Besides, I am here in my own country, and that excites me.\"\n\nAnd both, with free use of the spur, arrived at St. Omer without drawing\nbit. At St. Omer they breathed their horses with the bridles passed\nunder their arms for fear of accident, and ate a morsel from their hands\non the stones of the street, after they departed again.\n\nAt a hundred paces from the gates of Calais, d'Artagnan's horse gave\nout, and could not by any means be made to get up again, the blood\nflowing from his eyes and his nose. There still remained Planchet's\nhorse; but he stopped short, and could not be made to move a step.\n\nFortunately, as we have said, they were within a hundred paces of the\ncity; they left their two nags upon the high road, and ran toward the\nquay. Planchet called his master's attention to a gentleman who had just\narrived with his lackey, and only preceded them by about fifty paces.\nThey made all speed to come up to this gentleman, who appeared to be\nin great haste. His boots were covered with dust, and he inquired if he\ncould not instantly cross over to England.\n\n\"Nothing would be more easy,\" said the captain of a vessel ready to\nset sail, \"but this morning came an order to let no one leave without\nexpress permission from the cardinal.\"\n\n\"I have that permission,\" said the gentleman, drawing the paper from his\npocket; \"here it is.\"\n\n\"Have it examined by the governor of the port,\" said the shipmaster,\n\"and give me the preference.\"\n\n\"Where shall I find the governor?\"\n\n\"At his country house.\"\n\n\"And that is situated?\"\n\n\"At a quarter of a league from the city. Look, you may see it from\nhere--at the foot of that little hill, that slated roof.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the gentleman. And, with his lackey, he took the road\nto the governor's country house.\n\nD'Artagnan and Planchet followed the gentleman at a distance of five\nhundred paces. Once outside the city, d'Artagnan overtook the gentleman\nas he was entering a little wood.\n\n\"Monsieur, you appear to be in great haste?\"\n\n\"No one can be more so, monsieur.\"\n\n\"I am sorry for that,\" said d'Artagnan; \"for as I am in great haste\nlikewise, I wish to beg you to render me a service.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"To let me sail first.\"\n\n\"That's impossible,\" said the gentleman; \"I have traveled sixty leagues\nin forty hours, and by tomorrow at midday I must be in London.\"\n\n\"I have performed that same distance in forty hours, and by ten o'clock\nin the morning I must be in London.\"\n\n\"Very sorry, monsieur; but I was here first, and will not sail second.\"\n\n\"I am sorry, too, monsieur; but I arrived second, and must sail first.\"\n\n\"The king's service!\" said the gentleman.\n\n\"My own service!\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"But this is a needless quarrel you seek with me, as it seems to me.\"\n\n\"PARBLEU! What do you desire it to be?\"\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\n\"Would you like to know?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I wish that order of which you are bearer, seeing that I\nhave not one of my own and must have one.\"\n\n\"You jest, I presume.\"\n\n\"I never jest.\"\n\n\"Let me pass!\"\n\n\"You shall not pass.\"\n\n\"My brave young man, I will blow out your brains. HOLA, Lubin, my\npistols!\"\n\n\"Planchet,\" called out d'Artagnan, \"take care of the lackey; I will\nmanage the master.\"\n\nPlanchet, emboldened by the first exploit, sprang upon Lubin; and being\nstrong and vigorous, he soon got him on the broad of his back, and\nplaced his knee upon his breast.\n\n\"Go on with your affair, monsieur,\" cried Planchet; \"I have finished\nmine.\"\n\nSeeing this, the gentleman drew his sword, and sprang upon d'Artagnan;\nbut he had too strong an adversary. In three seconds d'Artagnan had\nwounded him three times, exclaiming at each thrust, \"One for Athos, one\nfor Porthos; and one for Aramis!\"\n\nAt the third hit the gentleman fell like a log. D'Artagnan believed him\nto be dead, or at least insensible, and went toward him for the purpose\nof taking the order; but the moment he extended his hand to search for\nit, the wounded man, who had not dropped his sword, plunged the point\ninto d'Artagnan's breast, crying, \"One for you!\"\n\n\"And one for me--the best for last!\" cried d'Artagnan, furious, nailing\nhim to the earth with a fourth thrust through his body.\n\nThis time the gentleman closed his eyes and fainted. D'Artagnan searched\nhis pockets, and took from one of them the order for the passage. It was\nin the name of Comte de Wardes.\n\nThen, casting a glance on the handsome young man, who was scarcely\ntwenty-five years of age, and whom he was leaving in his gore, deprived\nof sense and perhaps dead, he gave a sigh for that unaccountable destiny\nwhich leads men to destroy each other for the interests of people who\nare strangers to them and who often do not even know that they exist.\nBut he was soon aroused from these reflections by Lubin, who uttered\nloud cries and screamed for help with all his might.\n\nPlanchet grasped him by the throat, and pressed as hard as he could.\n\"Monsieur,\" said he, \"as long as I hold him in this manner, he can't\ncry, I'll be bound; but as soon as I let go he will howl again. I know\nhim for a Norman, and Normans are obstinate.\"\n\nIn fact, tightly held as he was, Lubin endeavored still to cry out.\n\n\"Stay!\" said d'Artagnan; and taking out his handkerchief, he gagged him.\n\n\"Now,\" said Planchet, \"let us bind him to a tree.\"\n\nThis being properly done, they drew the Comte de Wardes close to his\nservant; and as night was approaching, and as the wounded man and the\nbound man were at some little distance within the wood, it was evident\nthey were likely to remain there till the next day.\n\n\"And now,\" said d'Artagnan, \"to the Governor's.\"\n\n\"But you are wounded, it seems,\" said Planchet.\n\n\"Oh, that's nothing! Let us attend to what is more pressing first,\nand then we will attend to my wound; besides, it does not seem very\ndangerous.\"\n\nAnd they both set forward as fast as they could toward the country house\nof the worthy functionary.\n\nThe Comte de Wardes was announced, and d'Artagnan was introduced.\n\n\"You have an order signed by the cardinal?\" said the governor.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" replied d'Artagnan; \"here it is.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah! It is quite regular and explicit,\" said the governor.\n\n\"Most likely,\" said d'Artagnan; \"I am one of his most faithful\nservants.\"\n\n\"It appears that his Eminence is anxious to prevent someone from\ncrossing to England?\"\n\n\"Yes; a certain d'Artagnan, a Bearnese gentleman who left Paris in\ncompany with three of his friends, with the intention of going to\nLondon.\"\n\n\"Do you know him personally?\" asked the governor.\n\n\"Whom?\"\n\n\"This d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Perfectly well.\"\n\n\"Describe him to me, then.\"\n\n\"Nothing more easy.\"\n\nAnd d'Artagnan gave, feature for feature, a description of the Comte de\nWardes.\n\n\"Is he accompanied?\"\n\n\"Yes; by a lackey named Lubin.\"\n\n\"We will keep a sharp lookout for them; and if we lay hands on them his\nEminence may be assured they will be reconducted to Paris under a good\nescort.\"\n\n\"And by doing so, Monsieur the Governor,\" said d'Artagnan, \"you will\ndeserve well of the cardinal.\"\n\n\"Shall you see him on your return, Monsieur Count?\"\n\n\"Without a doubt.\"\n\n\"Tell him, I beg you, that I am his humble servant.\"\n\n\"I will not fail.\"\n\nDelighted with this assurance the governor countersigned the passport\nand delivered it to d'Artagnan. D'Artagnan lost no time in useless\ncompliments. He thanked the governor, bowed, and departed. Once outside,\nhe and Planchet set off as fast as they could; and by making a long\ndetour avoided the wood and reentered the city by another gate.\n\nThe vessel was quite ready to sail, and the captain was waiting on the\nwharf. \"Well?\" said he, on perceiving d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Here is my pass countersigned,\" said the latter.\n\n\"And that other gentleman?\n\n\"He will not go today,\" said d'Artagnan; \"but here, I'll pay you for us\ntwo.\"\n\n\"In that case let us go,\" said the shipmaster.\n\n\"Let us go,\" repeated d'Artagnan.\n\nHe leaped with Planchet into the boat, and five minutes after they were\non board. It was time; for they had scarcely sailed half a league, when\nd'Artagnan saw a flash and heard a detonation. It was the cannon which\nannounced the closing of the port.\n\nHe had now leisure to look to his wound. Fortunately, as d'Artagnan had\nthought, it was not dangerous. The point of the sword had touched a rib,\nand glanced along the bone. Still further, his shirt had stuck to the\nwound, and he had lost only a few drops of blood.\n\nD'Artagnan was worn out with fatigue. A mattress was laid upon the deck\nfor him. He threw himself upon it, and fell asleep.\n\nOn the morrow, at break of day, they were still three or four leagues\nfrom the coast of England. The breeze had been so light all night, they\nhad made but little progress. At ten o'clock the vessel cast anchor in\nthe harbor of Dover, and at half past ten d'Artagnan placed his foot on\nEnglish land, crying, \"Here I am at last!\"\n\nBut that was not all; they must get to London. In England the post\nwas well served. D'Artagnan and Planchet took each a post horse, and a\npostillion rode before them. In a few hours they were in the capital.\n\nD'Artagnan did not know London; he did not know a word of English;\nbut he wrote the name of Buckingham on a piece of paper, and everyone\npointed out to him the way to the duke's hotel.\n\nThe duke was at Windsor hunting with the king. D'Artagnan inquired for\nthe confidential valet of the duke, who, having accompanied him in all\nhis voyages, spoke French perfectly well; he told him that he came from\nParis on an affair of life and death, and that he must speak with his\nmaster instantly.\n\nThe confidence with which d'Artagnan spoke convinced Patrick, which was\nthe name of this minister of the minister. He ordered two horses to\nbe saddled, and himself went as guide to the young Guardsman. As for\nPlanchet, he had been lifted from his horse as stiff as a rush; the poor\nlad's strength was almost exhausted. d'Artagnan seemed iron.\n\nOn their arrival at the castle they learned that Buckingham and the king\nwere hawking in the marshes two or three leagues away. In twenty minutes\nthey were on the spot named. Patrick soon caught the sound of his\nmaster's voice calling his falcon.\n\n\"Whom must I announce to my Lord Duke?\" asked Patrick.\n\n\"The young man who one evening sought a quarrel with him on the Pont\nNeuf, opposite the Samaritaine.\"\n\n\"A singular introduction!\"\n\n\"You will find that it is as good as another.\"\n\nPatrick galloped off, reached the duke, and announced to him in the\nterms directed that a messenger awaited him.\n\nBuckingham at once remembered the circumstance, and suspecting that\nsomething was going on in France of which it was necessary he should be\ninformed, he only took the time to inquire where the messenger was, and\nrecognizing from afar the uniform of the Guards, he put his horse into\na gallop, and rode straight up to d'Artagnan. Patrick discreetly kept in\nthe background.\n\n\"No misfortune has happened to the queen?\" cried Buckingham, the instant\nhe came up, throwing all his fear and love into the question.\n\n\"I believe not; nevertheless I believe she runs some great peril from\nwhich your Grace alone can extricate her.\"\n\n\"I!\" cried Buckingham. \"What is it? I should be too happy to be of any\nservice to her. Speak, speak!\"\n\n\"Take this letter,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"This letter! From whom comes this letter?\"\n\n\"From her Majesty, as I think.\"\n\n\"From her Majesty!\" said Buckingham, becoming so pale that d'Artagnan\nfeared he would faint as he broke the seal.\n\n\"What is this rent?\" said he, showing d'Artagnan a place where it had\nbeen pierced through.\n\n\"Ah,\" said d'Artagnan, \"I did not see that; it was the sword of the\nComte de Wardes which made that hole, when he gave me a good thrust in\nthe breast.\"\n\n\"You are wounded?\" asked Buckingham, as he opened the letter.\n\n\"Oh, nothing but a scratch,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Just heaven, what have I read?\" cried the duke. \"Patrick, remain here,\nor rather join the king, wherever he may be, and tell his Majesty that\nI humbly beg him to excuse me, but an affair of the greatest importance\nrecalls me to London. Come, monsieur, come!\" and both set off towards\nthe capital at full gallop.\n\n\n\n\n21 THE COUNTESS DE WINTER\n\nAs they rode along, the duke endeavored to draw from d'Artagnan, not all\nthat had happened, but what d'Artagnan himself knew. By adding all that\nhe heard from the mouth of the young man to his own remembrances, he was\nenabled to form a pretty exact idea of a position of the seriousness of\nwhich, for the rest, the queen's letter, short but explicit, gave him\nthe clue. But that which astonished him most was that the cardinal, so\ndeeply interested in preventing this young man from setting his foot in\nEngland, had not succeeded in arresting him on the road. It was then,\nupon the manifestation of this astonishment, that d'Artagnan related to\nhim the precaution taken, and how, thanks to the devotion of his three\nfriends, whom he had left scattered and bleeding on the road, he had\nsucceeded in coming off with a single sword thrust, which had pierced\nthe queen's letter and for which he had repaid M. de Wardes with such\nterrible coin. While he was listening to this recital, delivered with\nthe greatest simplicity, the duke looked from time to time at the\nyoung man with astonishment, as if he could not comprehend how so much\nprudence, courage, and devotedness could be allied with a countenance\nwhich indicated not more than twenty years.\n\nThe horses went like the wind, and in a few minutes they were at the\ngates of London. D'Artagnan imagined that on arriving in town the duke\nwould slacken his pace, but it was not so. He kept on his way at the\nsame rate, heedless about upsetting those whom he met on the road. In\nfact, in crossing the city two or three accidents of this kind happened;\nbut Buckingham did not even turn his head to see what became of those\nhe had knocked down. d'Artagnan followed him amid cries which strongly\nresembled curses.\n\nOn entering the court of his hotel, Buckingham sprang from his horse,\nand without thinking what became of the animal, threw the bridle on his\nneck, and sprang toward the vestibule. D'Artagnan did the same, with a\nlittle more concern, however, for the noble creatures, whose merits he\nfully appreciated; but he had the satisfaction of seeing three or four\ngrooms run from the kitchens and the stables, and busy themselves with\nthe steeds.\n\nThe duke walked so fast that d'Artagnan had some trouble in keeping up\nwith him. He passed through several apartments, of an elegance of which\neven the greatest nobles of France had not even an idea, and arrived\nat length in a bedchamber which was at once a miracle of taste and of\nrichness. In the alcove of this chamber was a door concealed in the\ntapestry which the duke opened with a little gold key which he wore\nsuspended from his neck by a chain of the same metal. With discretion\nd'Artagnan remained behind; but at the moment when Buckingham crossed\nthe threshold, he turned round, and seeing the hesitation of the young\nman, \"Come in!\" cried he, \"and if you have the good fortune to be\nadmitted to her Majesty's presence, tell her what you have seen.\"\n\nEncouraged by this invitation, d'Artagnan followed the duke, who closed\nthe door after them. The two found themselves in a small chapel covered\nwith a tapestry of Persian silk worked with gold, and brilliantly\nlighted with a vast number of candles. Over a species of altar, and\nbeneath a canopy of blue velvet, surmounted by white and red plumes, was\na full-length portrait of Anne of Austria, so perfect in its resemblance\nthat d'Artagnan uttered a cry of surprise on beholding it. One might\nbelieve the queen was about to speak. On the altar, and beneath the\nportrait, was the casket containing the diamond studs.\n\nThe duke approached the altar, knelt as a priest might have done before\na crucifix, and opened the casket. \"There,\" said he, drawing from the\ncasket a large bow of blue ribbon all sparkling with diamonds, \"there\nare the precious studs which I have taken an oath should be buried with\nme. The queen gave them to me, the queen requires them again. Her will\nbe done, like that of God, in all things.\"\n\nThen, he began to kiss, one after the other, those dear studs with which\nhe was about to part. All at once he uttered a terrible cry.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" exclaimed d'Artagnan, anxiously; \"what has\nhappened to you, my Lord?\"\n\n\"All is lost!\" cried Buckingham, becoming as pale as a corpse; \"two of\nthe studs are wanting, there are only ten.\"\n\n\"Can you have lost them, my Lord, or do you think they have been\nstolen?\"\n\n\"They have been stolen,\" replied the duke, \"and it is the cardinal who\nhas dealt this blow. Hold; see! The ribbons which held them have been\ncut with scissors.\"\n\n\"If my Lord suspects they have been stolen, perhaps the person who stole\nthem still has them in his hands.\"\n\n\"Wait, wait!\" said the duke. \"The only time I have worn these studs was\nat a ball given by the king eight days ago at Windsor. The Comtesse de\nWinter, with whom I had quarreled, became reconciled to me at that ball.\nThat reconciliation was nothing but the vengeance of a jealous woman.\nI have never seen her from that day. The woman is an agent of the\ncardinal.\"\n\n\"He has agents, then, throughout the world?\" cried d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Buckingham, grating his teeth with rage. \"Yes, he is a\nterrible antagonist. But when is this ball to take place?\"\n\n\"Monday next.\"\n\n\"Monday next! Still five days before us. That's more time than we want.\nPatrick!\" cried the duke, opening the door of the chapel, \"Patrick!\" His\nconfidential valet appeared.\n\n\"My jeweler and my secretary.\"\n\nThe valet went out with a mute promptitude which showed him accustomed\nto obey blindly and without reply.\n\nBut although the jeweler had been mentioned first, it was the secretary\nwho first made his appearance. This was simply because he lived in the\nhotel. He found Buckingham seated at a table in his bedchamber, writing\norders with his own hand.\n\n\"Mr. Jackson,\" said he, \"go instantly to the Lord Chancellor, and tell\nhim that I charge him with the execution of these orders. I wish them to\nbe promulgated immediately.\"\n\n\"But, my Lord, if the Lord Chancellor interrogates me upon the motives\nwhich may have led your Grace to adopt such an extraordinary measure,\nwhat shall I reply?\"\n\n\"That such is my pleasure, and that I answer for my will to no man.\"\n\n\"Will that be the answer,\" replied the secretary, smiling, \"which he\nmust transmit to his Majesty if, by chance, his Majesty should have the\ncuriosity to know why no vessel is to leave any of the ports of Great\nBritain?\"\n\n\"You are right, Mr. Jackson,\" replied Buckingham. \"He will say, in that\ncase, to the king that I am determined on war, and that this measure is\nmy first act of hostility against France.\"\n\nThe secretary bowed and retired.\n\n\"We are safe on that side,\" said Buckingham, turning toward d'Artagnan.\n\"If the studs are not yet gone to Paris, they will not arrive till after\nyou.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"I have just placed an embargo on all vessels at present in his\nMajesty's ports, and without particular permission, not one dare lift an\nanchor.\"\n\nD'Artagnan looked with stupefaction at a man who thus employed the\nunlimited power with which he was clothed by the confidence of a king\nin the prosecution of his intrigues. Buckingham saw by the expression of\nthe young man's face what was passing in his mind, and he smiled.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"yes, Anne of Austria is my true queen. Upon a word from\nher, I would betray my country, I would betray my king, I would betray\nmy God. She asked me not to send the Protestants of La Rochelle the\nassistance I promised them; I have not done so. I broke my word, it is\ntrue; but what signifies that? I obeyed my love; and have I not been\nrichly paid for that obedience? It was to that obedience I owe her\nportrait.\"\n\nD'Artagnan was amazed to note by what fragile and unknown threads the\ndestinies of nations and the lives of men are suspended. He was lost in\nthese reflections when the goldsmith entered. He was an Irishman--one of\nthe most skillful of his craft, and who himself confessed that he gained\na hundred thousand livres a year by the Duke of Buckingham.\n\n\"Mr. O'Reilly,\" said the duke, leading him into the chapel, \"look at\nthese diamond studs, and tell me what they are worth apiece.\"\n\nThe goldsmith cast a glance at the elegant manner in which they were\nset, calculated, one with another, what the diamonds were worth, and\nwithout hesitation said, \"Fifteen hundred pistoles each, my Lord.\"\n\n\"How many days would it require to make two studs exactly like them? You\nsee there are two wanting.\"\n\n\"Eight days, my Lord.\"\n\n\"I will give you three thousand pistoles apiece if I can have them by\nthe day after tomorrow.\"\n\n\"My Lord, they shall be yours.\"\n\n\"You are a jewel of a man, Mr. O'Reilly; but that is not all. These\nstuds cannot be trusted to anybody; it must be done in the palace.\"\n\n\"Impossible, my Lord! There is no one but myself can so execute them\nthat one cannot tell the new from the old.\"\n\n\"Therefore, my dear Mr. O'Reilly, you are my prisoner. And if you wish\never to leave my palace, you cannot; so make the best of it. Name to\nme such of your workmen as you need, and point out the tools they must\nbring.\"\n\nThe goldsmith knew the duke. He knew all objection would be useless, and\ninstantly determined how to act.\n\n\"May I be permitted to inform my wife?\" said he.\n\n\"Oh, you may even see her if you like, my dear Mr. O'Reilly. Your\ncaptivity shall be mild, be assured; and as every inconvenience deserves\nits indemnification, here is, in addition to the price of the studs, an\norder for a thousand pistoles, to make you forget the annoyance I cause\nyou.\"\n\nD'Artagnan could not get over the surprise created in him by this\nminister, who thus open-handed, sported with men and millions.\n\nAs to the goldsmith, he wrote to his wife, sending her the order for the\nthousand pistoles, and charging her to send him, in exchange, his most\nskillful apprentice, an assortment of diamonds, of which he gave the\nnames and the weight, and the necessary tools.\n\nBuckingham conducted the goldsmith to the chamber destined for him, and\nwhich, at the end of half an hour, was transformed into a workshop. Then\nhe placed a sentinel at each door, with an order to admit nobody upon\nany pretense but his VALET DE CHAMBRE, Patrick. We need not add that the\ngoldsmith, O'Reilly, and his assistant, were prohibited from going out\nunder any pretext. This point, settled, the duke turned to d'Artagnan.\n\"Now, my young friend,\" said he, \"England is all our own. What do you\nwish for? What do you desire?\"\n\n\"A bed, my Lord,\" replied d'Artagnan. \"At present, I confess, that is\nthe thing I stand most in need of.\"\n\nBuckingham gave d'Artagnan a chamber adjoining his own. He wished to\nhave the young man at hand--not that he at all mistrusted him, but\nfor the sake of having someone to whom he could constantly talk of the\nqueen.\n\nIn one hour after, the ordinance was published in London that no vessel\nbound for France should leave port, not even the packet boat with\nletters. In the eyes of everybody this was a declaration of war between\nthe two kingdoms.\n\nOn the day after the morrow, by eleven o'clock, the two diamond studs\nwere finished, and they were so completely imitated, so perfectly alike,\nthat Buckingham could not tell the new ones from the old ones,\nand experts in such matters would have been deceived as he was. He\nimmediately called d'Artagnan. \"Here,\" said he to him, \"are the diamond\nstuds that you came to bring; and be my witness that I have done all\nthat human power could do.\"\n\n\"Be satisfied, my Lord, I will tell all that I have seen. But does your\nGrace mean to give me the studs without the casket?\"\n\n\"The casket would encumber you. Besides, the casket is the more precious\nfrom being all that is left to me. You will say that I keep it.\"\n\n\"I will perform your commission, word for word, my Lord.\"\n\n\"And now,\" resumed Buckingham, looking earnestly at the young man, \"how\nshall I ever acquit myself of the debt I owe you?\"\n\nD'Artagnan blushed up to the whites of his eyes. He saw that the duke\nwas searching for a means of making him accept something and the idea\nthat the blood of his friends and himself was about to be paid for with\nEnglish gold was strangely repugnant to him.\n\n\"Let us understand each other, my Lord,\" replied d'Artagnan, \"and let us\nmake things clear beforehand in order that there may be no mistake. I\nam in the service of the King and Queen of France, and form part of\nthe company of Monsieur Dessessart, who, as well as his brother-in-law,\nMonsieur de Treville, is particularly attached to their Majesties.\nWhat I have done, then, has been for the queen, and not at all for your\nGrace. And still further, it is very probable I should not have done\nanything of this, if it had not been to make myself agreeable to someone\nwho is my lady, as the queen is yours.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the duke, smiling, \"and I even believe that I know that\nother person; it is--\"\n\n\"My Lord, I have not named her!\" interrupted the young man, warmly.\n\n\"That is true,\" said the duke; \"and it is to this person I am bound to\ndischarge my debt of gratitude.\"\n\n\"You have said, my Lord; for truly, at this moment when there is\nquestion of war, I confess to you that I see nothing in your Grace but\nan Englishman, and consequently an enemy whom I should have much greater\npleasure in meeting on the field of battle than in the park at Windsor\nor the corridors of the Louvre--all which, however, will not prevent me\nfrom executing to the very point my commission or from laying down my\nlife, if there be need of it, to accomplish it; but I repeat it to your\nGrace, without your having personally on that account more to thank me\nfor in this second interview than for what I did for you in the first.\"\n\n\"We say, 'Proud as a Scotsman,'\" murmured the Duke of Buckingham.\n\n\"And we say, 'Proud as a Gascon,'\" replied d'Artagnan. \"The Gascons are\nthe Scots of France.\"\n\nD'Artagnan bowed to the duke, and was retiring.\n\n\"Well, are you going away in that manner? Where, and how?\"\n\n\"That's true!\"\n\n\"Fore Gad, these Frenchmen have no consideration!\"\n\n\"I had forgotten that England was an island, and that you were the king\nof it.\"\n\n\"Go to the riverside, ask for the brig SUND, and give this letter to the\ncaptain; he will convey you to a little port, where certainly you are\nnot expected, and which is ordinarily only frequented by fishermen.\"\n\n\"The name of that port?\"\n\n\"St. Valery; but listen. When you have arrived there you will go to a\nmean tavern, without a name and without a sign--a mere fisherman's hut.\nYou cannot be mistaken; there is but one.\"\n\n\"Afterward?\"\n\n\"You will ask for the host, and will repeat to him the word 'Forward!'\"\n\n\"Which means?\"\n\n\"In French, EN AVANT. It is the password. He will give you a horse all\nsaddled, and will point out to you the road you ought to take. You will\nfind, in the same way, four relays on your route. If you will give at\neach of these relays your address in Paris, the four horses will\nfollow you thither. You already know two of them, and you appeared to\nappreciate them like a judge. They were those we rode on; and you may\nrely upon me for the others not being inferior to them. These horses are\nequipped for the field. However proud you may be, you will not refuse to\naccept one of them, and to request your three companions to accept\nthe others--that is, in order to make war against us. Besides, the end\njustified the means, as you Frenchmen say, does it not?\"\n\n\"Yes, my Lord, I accept them,\" said d'Artagnan; \"and if it please God,\nwe will make a good use of your presents.\"\n\n\"Well, now, your hand, young man. Perhaps we shall soon meet on the\nfield of battle; but in the meantime we shall part good friends, I\nhope.\"\n\n\"Yes, my Lord; but with the hope of soon becoming enemies.\"\n\n\"Be satisfied; I promise you that.\"\n\n\"I depend upon your word, my Lord.\"\n\nD'Artagnan bowed to the duke, and made his way as quickly as possible to\nthe riverside. Opposite the Tower of London he found the vessel that had\nbeen named to him, delivered his letter to the captain, who after having\nit examined by the governor of the port made immediate preparations to\nsail.\n\nFifty vessels were waiting to set out. Passing alongside one of them,\nd'Artagnan fancied he perceived on board it the woman of Meung--the same\nwhom the unknown gentleman had called Milady, and whom d'Artagnan had\nthought so handsome; but thanks to the current of the stream and a\nfair wind, his vessel passed so quickly that he had little more than a\nglimpse of her.\n\nThe next day about nine o'clock in the morning, he landed at St. Valery.\nD'Artagnan went instantly in search of the inn, and easily discovered\nit by the riotous noise which resounded from it. War between England\nand France was talked of as near and certain, and the jolly sailors were\nhaving a carousal.\n\nD'Artagnan made his way through the crowd, advanced toward the host,\nand pronounced the word \"Forward!\" The host instantly made him a sign to\nfollow, went out with him by a door which opened into a yard, led him to\nthe stable, where a saddled horse awaited him, and asked him if he stood\nin need of anything else.\n\n\"I want to know the route I am to follow,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Go from hence to Blangy, and from Blangy to Neufchatel. At Neufchatel,\ngo to the tavern of the Golden Harrow, give the password to the\nlandlord, and you will find, as you have here, a horse ready saddled.\"\n\n\"Have I anything to pay?\" demanded d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Everything is paid,\" replied the host, \"and liberally. Begone, and may\nGod guide you!\"\n\n\"Amen!\" cried the young man, and set off at full gallop.\n\nFour hours later he was in Neufchatel. He strictly followed the\ninstructions he had received. At Neufchatel, as at St. Valery, he found\na horse quite ready and awaiting him. He was about to remove the pistols\nfrom the saddle he had quit to the one he was about to fill, but he\nfound the holsters furnished with similar pistols.\n\n\"Your address at Paris?\"\n\n\"Hotel of the Guards, company of Dessessart.\"\n\n\"Enough,\" replied the questioner.\n\n\"Which route must I take?\" demanded d'Artagnan, in his turn.\n\n\"That of Rouen; but you will leave the city on your right. You must stop\nat the little village of Eccuis, in which there is but one tavern--the\nShield of France. Don't condemn it from appearances; you will find a\nhorse in the stables quite as good as this.\"\n\n\"The same password?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"Adieu, master!\"\n\n\"A good journey, gentlemen! Do you want anything?\"\n\nD'Artagnan shook his head, and set off at full speed. At Eccuis, the\nsame scene was repeated. He found as provident a host and a fresh horse.\nHe left his address as he had done before, and set off again at the same\npace for Pontoise. At Pontoise he changed his horse for the last time,\nand at nine o'clock galloped into the yard of Treville's hotel. He had\nmade nearly sixty leagues in little more than twelve hours.\n\nM. de Treville received him as if he had seen him that same morning;\nonly, when pressing his hand a little more warmly than usual, he\ninformed him that the company of Dessessart was on duty at the Louvre,\nand that he might repair at once to his post.\n\n\n\n\n22 THE BALLET OF LA MERLAISON\n\nOn the morrow, nothing was talked of in Paris but the ball which the\naldermen of the city were to give to the king and queen, and in which\ntheir Majesties were to dance the famous La Merlaison--the favorite\nballet of the king.\n\nEight days had been occupied in preparations at the Hotel de Ville for\nthis important evening. The city carpenters had erected scaffolds\nupon which the invited ladies were to be placed; the city grocer had\nornamented the chambers with two hundred FLAMBEAUX of white wax, a piece\nof luxury unheard of at that period; and twenty violins were ordered,\nand the price for them fixed at double the usual rate, upon condition,\nsaid the report, that they should be played all night.\n\nAt ten o'clock in the morning the Sieur de la Coste, ensign in the\nking's Guards, followed by two officers and several archers of that\nbody, came to the city registrar, named Clement, and demanded of him all\nthe keys of the rooms and offices of the hotel. These keys were given\nup to him instantly. Each of them had ticket attached to it, by which\nit might be recognized; and from that moment the Sieur de la Coste was\ncharged with the care of all the doors and all the avenues.\n\nAt eleven o'clock came in his turn Duhallier, captain of the Guards,\nbringing with him fifty archers, who were distributed immediately\nthrough the Hotel de Ville, at the doors assigned them.\n\nAt three o'clock came two companies of the Guards, one French, the\nother Swiss. The company of French guards was composed of half of M.\nDuhallier's men and half of M. Dessessart's men.\n\nAt six in the evening the guests began to come. As fast as they entered,\nthey were placed in the grand saloon, on the platforms prepared for\nthem.\n\nAt nine o'clock Madame la Premiere Presidente arrived. As next to the\nqueen, she was the most considerable personage of the fete, she was\nreceived by the city officials, and placed in a box opposite to that\nwhich the queen was to occupy.\n\nAt ten o'clock, the king's collation, consisting of preserves and other\ndelicacies, was prepared in the little room on the side of the church of\nSt. Jean, in front of the silver buffet of the city, which was guarded\nby four archers.\n\nAt midnight great cries and loud acclamations were heard. It was the\nking, who was passing through the streets which led from the Louvre\nto the Hotel de Ville, and which were all illuminated with colored\nlanterns.\n\nImmediately the aldermen, clothed in their cloth robes and preceded by\nsix sergeants, each holding a FLAMBEAU in his hand, went to attend upon\nthe king, whom they met on the steps, where the provost of the merchants\nmade him the speech of welcome--a compliment to which his Majesty\nreplied with an apology for coming so late, laying the blame upon the\ncardinal, who had detained him till eleven o'clock, talking of affairs\nof state.\n\nHis Majesty, in full dress, was accompanied by his royal Highness, M. le\nComte de Soissons, by the Grand Prior, by the Duc de Longueville, by the\nDuc d'Euboeuf, by the Comte d'Harcourt, by the Comte de la Roche-Guyon,\nby M. de Liancourt, by M. de Baradas, by the Comte de Cramail, and by\nthe Chevalier de Souveray. Everybody noticed that the king looked dull\nand preoccupied.\n\nA private room had been prepared for the king and another for Monsieur.\nIn each of these closets were placed masquerade dresses. The same had\nbeen done for the queen and Madame the President. The nobles and ladies\nof their Majesties' suites were to dress, two by two, in chambers\nprepared for the purpose. Before entering his closet the king desired to\nbe informed the moment the cardinal arrived.\n\nHalf an hour after the entrance of the king, fresh acclamations were\nheard; these announced the arrival of the queen. The aldermen did as\nthey had done before, and preceded by their sergeants, advanced to\nreceive their illustrious guest. The queen entered the great hall; and\nit was remarked that, like the king, she looked dull and even weary.\n\nAt the moment she entered, the curtain of a small gallery which to\nthat time had been closed, was drawn, and the pale face of the cardinal\nappeared, he being dressed as a Spanish cavalier. His eyes were fixed\nupon those of the queen, and a smile of terrible joy passed over his\nlips; the queen did not wear her diamond studs.\n\nThe queen remained for a short time to receive the compliments of the\ncity dignitaries and to reply to the salutations of the ladies. All\nat once the king appeared with the cardinal at one of the doors of the\nhall. The cardinal was speaking to him in a low voice, and the king was\nvery pale.\n\nThe king made his way through the crowd without a mask, and the ribbons\nof his doublet scarcely tied. He went straight to the queen, and in an\naltered voice said, \"Why, madame, have you not thought proper to\nwear your diamond studs, when you know it would give me so much\ngratification?\"\n\nThe queen cast a glance around her, and saw the cardinal behind, with a\ndiabolical smile on his countenance.\n\n\"Sire,\" replied the queen, with a faltering voice, \"because, in the\nmidst of such a crowd as this, I feared some accident might happen to\nthem.\"\n\n\"And you were wrong, madame. If I made you that present it was that you\nmight adorn yourself therewith. I tell you that you were wrong.\"\n\nThe voice of the king was tremulous with anger. Everybody looked and\nlistened with astonishment, comprehending nothing of what passed.\n\n\"Sire,\" said the queen, \"I can send for them to the Louvre, where they\nare, and thus your Majesty's wishes will be complied with.\"\n\n\"Do so, madame, do so, and that at once; for within an hour the ballet\nwill commence.\"\n\nThe queen bent in token of submission, and followed the ladies who\nwere to conduct her to her room. On his part the king returned to his\napartment.\n\nThere was a moment of trouble and confusion in the assembly. Everybody\nhad remarked that something had passed between the king and queen; but\nboth of them had spoken so low that everybody, out of respect, withdrew\nseveral steps, so that nobody had heard anything. The violins began to\nsound with all their might, but nobody listened to them.\n\nThe king came out first from his room. He was in a most elegant hunting\ncostume; and Monsieur and the other nobles were dressed like him.\nThis was the costume that best became the king. So dressed, he really\nappeared the first gentleman of his kingdom.\n\nThe cardinal drew near to the king, and placed in his hand a small\ncasket. The king opened it, and found in it two diamond studs.\n\n\"What does this mean?\" demanded he of the cardinal.\n\n\"Nothing,\" replied the latter; \"only, if the queen has the studs, which\nI very much doubt, count them, sire, and if you only find ten, ask her\nMajesty who can have stolen from her the two studs that are here.\"\n\nThe king looked at the cardinal as if to interrogate him; but he had\nnot time to address any question to him--a cry of admiration burst\nfrom every mouth. If the king appeared to be the first gentleman of his\nkingdom, the queen was without doubt the most beautiful woman in France.\n\nIt is true that the habit of a huntress became her admirably. She wore a\nbeaver hat with blue feathers, a surtout of gray-pearl velvet, fastened\nwith diamond clasps, and a petticoat of blue satin, embroidered with\nsilver. On her left shoulder sparkled the diamond studs, on a bow of the\nsame color as the plumes and the petticoat.\n\nThe king trembled with joy and the cardinal with vexation; although,\ndistant as they were from the queen, they could not count the studs. The\nqueen had them. The only question was, had she ten or twelve?\n\nAt that moment the violins sounded the signal for the ballet. The king\nadvanced toward Madame the President, with whom he was to dance, and his\nHighness Monsieur with the queen. They took their places, and the ballet\nbegan.\n\nThe king danced facing the queen, and every time he passed by her, he\ndevoured with his eyes those studs of which he could not ascertain the\nnumber. A cold sweat covered the brow of the cardinal.\n\nThe ballet lasted an hour, and had sixteen ENTREES. The ballet ended\namid the applause of the whole assemblage, and everyone reconducted his\nlady to her place; but the king took advantage of the privilege he had\nof leaving his lady, to advance eagerly toward the queen.\n\n\"I thank you, madame,\" said he, \"for the deference you have shown to my\nwishes, but I think you want two of the studs, and I bring them back to\nyou.\"\n\nWith these words he held out to the queen the two studs the cardinal had\ngiven him.\n\n\"How, sire?\" cried the young queen, affecting surprise, \"you are giving\nme, then, two more: I shall have fourteen.\"\n\nIn fact the king counted them, and the twelve studs were all on her\nMajesty's shoulder.\n\nThe king called the cardinal.\n\n\"What does this mean, Monsieur Cardinal?\" asked the king in a severe\ntone.\n\n\"This means, sire,\" replied the cardinal, \"that I was desirous of\npresenting her Majesty with these two studs, and that not daring to\noffer them myself, I adopted this means of inducing her to accept them.\"\n\n\"And I am the more grateful to your Eminence,\" replied Anne of Austria,\nwith a smile that proved she was not the dupe of this ingenious\ngallantry, \"from being certain that these two studs alone have cost you\nas much as all the others cost his Majesty.\"\n\nThen saluting the king and the cardinal, the queen resumed her way to\nthe chamber in which she had dressed, and where she was to take off her\ncostume.\n\nThe attention which we have been obliged to give, during the\ncommencement of the chapter, to the illustrious personages we have\nintroduced into it, has diverted us for an instant from him to whom\nAnne of Austria owed the extraordinary triumph she had obtained over the\ncardinal; and who, confounded, unknown, lost in the crowd gathered at\none of the doors, looked on at this scene, comprehensible only to four\npersons--the king, the queen, his Eminence, and himself.\n\nThe queen had just regained her chamber, and d'Artagnan was about to\nretire, when he felt his shoulder lightly touched. He turned and saw a\nyoung woman, who made him a sign to follow her. The face of this young\nwoman was covered with a black velvet mask; but notwithstanding this\nprecaution, which was in fact taken rather against others than against\nhim, he at once recognized his usual guide, the light and intelligent\nMme. Bonacieux.\n\nOn the evening before, they had scarcely seen each other for a moment at\nthe apartment of the Swiss guard, Germain, whither d'Artagnan had sent\nfor her. The haste which the young woman was in to convey to the queen\nthe excellent news of the happy return of her messenger prevented the\ntwo lovers from exchanging more than a few words. D'Artagnan therefore\nfollowed Mme. Bonacieux moved by a double sentiment--love and curiosity.\nAll the way, and in proportion as the corridors became more deserted,\nd'Artagnan wished to stop the young woman, seize her and gaze upon her,\nwere it only for a minute; but quick as a bird she glided between his\nhands, and when he wished to speak to her, her finger placed upon her\nmouth, with a little imperative gesture full of grace, reminded him\nthat he was under the command of a power which he must blindly obey, and\nwhich forbade him even to make the slightest complaint. At length, after\nwinding about for a minute or two, Mme. Bonacieux opened the door of a\ncloset, which was entirely dark, and led d'Artagnan into it. There she\nmade a fresh sign of silence, and opened a second door concealed by\ntapestry. The opening of this door disclosed a brilliant light, and she\ndisappeared.\n\nD'Artagnan remained for a moment motionless, asking himself where he\ncould be; but soon a ray of light which penetrated through the chamber,\ntogether with the warm and perfumed air which reached him from the same\naperture, the conversation of two of three ladies in language at once\nrespectful and refined, and the word \"Majesty\" several times repeated,\nindicated clearly that he was in a closet attached to the queen's\napartment. The young man waited in comparative darkness and listened.\n\nThe queen appeared cheerful and happy, which seemed to astonish the\npersons who surrounded her and who were accustomed to see her almost\nalways sad and full of care. The queen attributed this joyous feeling\nto the beauty of the fete, to the pleasure she had experienced in the\nballet; and as it is not permissible to contradict a queen, whether she\nsmile or weep, everybody expatiated on the gallantry of the aldermen of\nthe city of Paris.\n\nAlthough d'Artagnan did not at all know the queen, he soon distinguished\nher voice from the others, at first by a slightly foreign accent, and\nnext by that tone of domination naturally impressed upon all royal\nwords. He heard her approach and withdraw from the partially open door;\nand twice or three times he even saw the shadow of a person intercept\nthe light.\n\nAt length a hand and an arm, surpassingly beautiful in their form and\nwhiteness, glided through the tapestry. D'Artagnan at once comprehended\nthat this was his recompense. He cast himself on his knees, seized\nthe hand, and touched it respectfully with his lips. Then the hand was\nwithdrawn, leaving in his an object which he perceived to be a ring. The\ndoor immediately closed, and d'Artagnan found himself again in complete\nobscurity.\n\nD'Artagnan placed the ring on his finger, and again waited; it was\nevident that all was not yet over. After the reward of his devotion,\nthat of his love was to come. Besides, although the ballet was danced,\nthe evening had scarcely begun. Supper was to be served at three, and\nthe clock of St. Jean had struck three quarters past two.\n\nThe sound of voices diminished by degrees in the adjoining chamber. The\ncompany was then heard departing; then the door of the closet in which\nd'Artagnan was, was opened, and Mme. Bonacieux entered.\n\n\"You at last?\" cried d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Silence!\" said the young woman, placing her hand upon his lips;\n\"silence, and go the same way you came!\"\n\n\"But where and when shall I see you again?\" cried d'Artagnan.\n\n\"A note which you will find at home will tell you. Begone, begone!\"\n\nAt these words she opened the door of the corridor, and pushed\nd'Artagnan out of the room. D'Artagnan obeyed like a child, without the\nleast resistance or objection, which proved that he was really in love.\n\n\n\n\n23 THE RENDEZVOUS\n\nD'Artagnan ran home immediately, and although it was three o'clock in\nthe morning and he had some of the worst quarters of Paris to traverse,\nhe met with no misadventure. Everyone knows that drunkards and lovers\nhave a protecting deity.\n\nHe found the door of his passage open, sprang up the stairs and knocked\nsoftly in a manner agreed upon between him and his lackey. Planchet*,\nwhom he had sent home two hours before from the Hotel de Ville, telling\nhim to sit up for him, opened the door for him.\n\n*The reader may ask, \"How came Planchet here?\" when he was left \"stiff\nas a rush\" in London. In the intervening time Buckingham perhaps sent\nhim to Paris, as he did the horses.\n\n\"Has anyone brought a letter for me?\" asked d'Artagnan, eagerly.\n\n\"No one has BROUGHT a letter, monsieur,\" replied Planchet; \"but one has\ncome of itself.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, blockhead?\"\n\n\"I mean to say that when I came in, although I had the key of your\napartment in my pocket, and that key had never quit me, I found a letter\non the green table cover in your bedroom.\"\n\n\"And where is that letter?\"\n\n\"I left it where I found it, monsieur. It is not natural for letters\nto enter people's houses in this manner. If the window had been open or\neven ajar, I should think nothing of it; but, no--all was hermetically\nsealed. Beware, monsieur; there is certainly some magic underneath.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the young man had darted in to his chamber, and opened the\nletter. It was from Mme. Bonacieux, and was expressed in these terms:\n\n\"There are many thanks to be offered to you, and to be transmitted to\nyou. Be this evening about ten o'clock at St. Cloud, in front of the\npavilion which stands at the corner of the house of M. d'Estrees.--C.B.\"\n\nWhile reading this letter, d'Artagnan felt his heart dilated and\ncompressed by that delicious spasm which tortures and caresses the\nhearts of lovers.\n\nIt was the first billet he had received; it was the first rendezvous\nthat had been granted him. His heart, swelled by the intoxication of\njoy, felt ready to dissolve away at the very gate of that terrestrial\nparadise called Love!\n\n\"Well, monsieur,\" said Planchet, who had observed his master grow\nred and pale successively, \"did I not guess truly? Is it not some bad\naffair?\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, Planchet,\" replied d'Artagnan; \"and as a proof, there\nis a crown to drink my health.\"\n\n\"I am much obliged to Monsieur for the crown he had given me, and I\npromise him to follow his instructions exactly; but it is not the less\ntrue that letters which come in this way into shut-up houses--\"\n\n\"Fall from heaven, my friend, fall from heaven.\"\n\n\"Then Monsieur is satisfied?\" asked Planchet.\n\n\"My dear Planchet, I am the happiest of men!\"\n\n\"And I may profit by Monsieur's happiness, and go to bed?\"\n\n\"Yes, go.\"\n\n\"May the blessings of heaven fall upon Monsieur! But it is not the less\ntrue that that letter--\"\n\nAnd Planchet retired, shaking his head with an air of doubt, which the\nliberality of d'Artagnan had not entirely effaced.\n\nLeft alone, d'Artagnan read and reread his billet. Then he kissed and\nrekissed twenty times the lines traced by the hand of his beautiful\nmistress. At length he went to bed, fell asleep, and had golden dreams.\n\nAt seven o'clock in the morning he arose and called Planchet, who at the\nsecond summons opened the door, his countenance not yet quite freed from\nthe anxiety of the preceding night.\n\n\"Planchet,\" said d'Artagnan, \"I am going out for all day, perhaps. You\nare, therefore, your own master till seven o'clock in the evening; but\nat seven o'clock you must hold yourself in readiness with two horses.\"\n\n\"There!\" said Planchet. \"We are going again, it appears, to have our\nhides pierced in all sorts of ways.\"\n\n\"You will take your musketoon and your pistols.\"\n\n\"There, now! Didn't I say so?\" cried Planchet. \"I was sure of it--the\ncursed letter!\"\n\n\"Don't be afraid, you idiot; there is nothing in hand but a party of\npleasure.\"\n\n\"Ah, like the charming journey the other day, when it rained bullets and\nproduced a crop of steel traps!\"\n\n\"Well, if you are really afraid, Monsieur Planchet,\" resumed d'Artagnan,\n\"I will go without you. I prefer traveling alone to having a companion\nwho entertains the least fear.\"\n\n\"Monsieur does me wrong,\" said Planchet; \"I thought he had seen me at\nwork.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I thought perhaps you had worn out all your courage the first\ntime.\"\n\n\"Monsieur shall see that upon occasion I have some left; only I beg\nMonsieur not to be too prodigal of it if he wishes it to last long.\"\n\n\"Do you believe you have still a certain amount of it to expend this\nevening?\"\n\n\"I hope so, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I count on you.\"\n\n\"At the appointed hour I shall be ready; only I believed that Monsieur\nhad but one horse in the Guard stables.\"\n\n\"Perhaps there is but one at this moment; but by this evening there will\nbe four.\"\n\n\"It appears that our journey was a remounting journey, then?\"\n\n\"Exactly so,\" said d'Artagnan; and nodding to Planchet, he went out.\n\nM. Bonacieux was at his door. D'Artagnan's intention was to go out\nwithout speaking to the worthy mercer; but the latter made so polite and\nfriendly a salutation that his tenant felt obliged, not only to stop,\nbut to enter into conversation with him.\n\nBesides, how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a\nhusband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that\nsame evening at St. Cloud, opposite D'Estrees's pavilion? D'Artagnan\napproached him with the most amiable air he could assume.\n\nThe conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor\nman. M. Bonacieux, who was ignorant that d'Artagnan had overheard his\nconversation with the stranger of Meung, related to his young tenant the\npersecutions of that monster, M. de Laffemas, whom he never ceased\nto designate, during his account, by the title of the \"cardinal's\nexecutioner,\" and expatiated at great length upon the Bastille, the\nbolts, the wickets, the dungeons, the gratings, the instruments of\ntorture.\n\nD'Artagnan listened to him with exemplary complaisance, and when he\nhad finished said, \"And Madame Bonacieux, do you know who carried her\noff?--For I do not forget that I owe to that unpleasant circumstance the\ngood fortune of having made your acquaintance.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Bonacieux, \"they took good care not to tell me that; and my\nwife, on her part, has sworn to me by all that's sacred that she does\nnot know. But you,\" continued M. Bonacieux, in a tine of perfect good\nfellowship, \"what has become of you all these days? I have not seen you\nnor your friends, and I don't think you could gather all that dust\nthat I saw Planchet brush off your boots yesterday from the pavement of\nParis.\"\n\n\"You are right, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux, my friends and I have been\non a little journey.\"\n\n\"Far from here?\"\n\n\"Oh, Lord, no! About forty leagues only. We went to take Monsieur Athos\nto the waters of Forges, where my friends still remain.\"\n\n\"And you have returned, have you not?\" replied M. Bonacieux, giving to\nhis countenance a most sly air. \"A handsome young fellow like you\ndoes not obtain long leaves of absence from his mistress; and we were\nimpatiently waited for at Paris, were we not?\"\n\n\"My faith!\" said the young man, laughing, \"I confess it, and so much\nmore the readily, my dear Bonacieux, as I see there is no concealing\nanything from you. Yes, I was expected, and very impatiently, I\nacknowledge.\"\n\nA slight shade passed over the brow of Bonacieux, but so slight that\nd'Artagnan did not perceive it.\n\n\"And we are going to be recompensed for our diligence?\" continued the\nmercer, with a trifling alteration in his voice--so trifling, indeed,\nthat d'Artagnan did not perceive it any more than he had the momentary\nshade which, an instant before, had darkened the countenance of the\nworthy man.\n\n\"Ah, may you be a true prophet!\" said d'Artagnan, laughing.\n\n\"No; what I say,\" replied Bonacieux, \"is only that I may know whether I\nam delaying you.\"\n\n\"Why that question, my dear host?\" asked d'Artagnan. \"Do you intend to\nsit up for me?\"\n\n\"No; but since my arrest and the robbery that was committed in my house,\nI am alarmed every time I hear a door open, particularly in the night.\nWhat the deuce can you expect? I am no swordsman.\"\n\n\"Well, don't be alarmed if I return at one, two or three o'clock in the\nmorning; indeed, do not be alarmed if I do not come at all.\"\n\nThis time Bonacieux became so pale that d'Artagnan could not help\nperceiving it, and asked him what was the matter.\n\n\"Nothing,\" replied Bonacieux, \"nothing. Since my misfortunes I have been\nsubject to faintnesses, which seize me all at once, and I have just\nfelt a cold shiver. Pay no attention to it; you have nothing to occupy\nyourself with but being happy.\"\n\n\"Then I have full occupation, for I am so.\"\n\n\"Not yet; wait a little! This evening, you said.\"\n\n\"Well, this evening will come, thank God! And perhaps you look for it\nwith as much impatience as I do; perhaps this evening Madame Bonacieux\nwill visit the conjugal domicile.\"\n\n\"Madame Bonacieux is not at liberty this evening,\" replied the husband,\nseriously; \"she is detained at the Louvre this evening by her duties.\"\n\n\"So much the worse for you, my dear host, so much the worse! When I\nam happy, I wish all the world to be so; but it appears that is not\npossible.\"\n\nThe young man departed, laughing at the joke, which he thought he alone\ncould comprehend.\n\n\"Amuse yourself well!\" replied Bonacieux, in a sepulchral tone.\n\nBut d'Artagnan was too far off to hear him; and if he had heard him in\nthe disposition of mind he then enjoyed, he certainly would not have\nremarked it.\n\nHe took his way toward the hotel of M. de Treville; his visit of the\nday before, it is to be remembered, had been very short and very little\nexplicative.\n\nHe found Treville in a joyful mood. He had thought the king and queen\ncharming at the ball. It is true the cardinal had been particularly\nill-tempered. He had retired at one o'clock under the pretense of being\nindisposed. As to their Majesties, they did not return to the Louvre\ntill six o'clock in the morning.\n\n\"Now,\" said Treville, lowering his voice, and looking into every corner\nof the apartment to see if they were alone, \"now let us talk about\nyourself, my young friend; for it is evident that your happy return has\nsomething to do with the joy of the king, the triumph of the queen, and\nthe humiliation of his Eminence. You must look out for yourself.\"\n\n\"What have I to fear,\" replied d'Artagnan, \"as long as I shall have the\nluck to enjoy the favor of their Majesties?\"\n\n\"Everything, believe me. The cardinal is not the man to forget a\nmystification until he has settled account with the mystifier; and the\nmystifier appears to me to have the air of being a certain young Gascon\nof my acquaintance.\"\n\n\"Do you believe that the cardinal is as well posted as yourself, and\nknows that I have been to London?\"\n\n\"The devil! You have been to London! Was it from London you brought\nthat beautiful diamond that glitters on your finger? Beware, my dear\nd'Artagnan! A present from an enemy is not a good thing. Are there not\nsome Latin verses upon that subject? Stop!\"\n\n\"Yes, doubtless,\" replied d'Artagnan, who had never been able to cram\nthe first rudiments of that language into his head, and who had by his\nignorance driven his master to despair, \"yes, doubtless there is one.\"\n\n\"There certainly is one,\" said M. de Treville, who had a tincture of\nliterature, \"and Monsieur de Benserade was quoting it to me the other\nday. Stop a minute--ah, this is it: 'Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes,'\nwhich means, 'Beware of the enemy who makes you presents.\"\n\n\"This diamond does not come from an enemy, monsieur,\" replied\nd'Artagnan, \"it comes from the queen.\"\n\n\"From the queen! Oh, oh!\" said M. de Treville. \"Why, it is indeed a true\nroyal jewel, which is worth a thousand pistoles if it is worth a denier.\nBy whom did the queen send you this jewel?\"\n\n\"She gave it to me herself.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"In the room adjoining the chamber in which she changed her toilet.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Giving me her hand to kiss.\"\n\n\"You have kissed the queen's hand?\" said M. de Treville, looking\nearnestly at d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Her Majesty did me the honor to grant me that favor.\"\n\n\"And that in the presence of witnesses! Imprudent, thrice imprudent!\"\n\n\"No, monsieur, be satisfied; nobody saw her,\" replied d'Artagnan, and he\nrelated to M. de Treville how the affair came to pass.\n\n\"Oh, the women, the women!\" cried the old soldier. \"I know them by their\nromantic imagination. Everything that savors of mystery charms them. So\nyou have seen the arm, that was all. You would meet the queen, and she\nwould not know who you are?\"\n\n\"No; but thanks to this diamond,\" replied the young man.\n\n\"Listen,\" said M. de Treville; \"shall I give you counsel, good counsel,\nthe counsel of a friend?\"\n\n\"You will do me honor, monsieur,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Well, then, off to the nearest goldsmith's, and sell that diamond for\nthe highest price you can get from him. However much of a Jew he may be,\nhe will give you at least eight hundred pistoles. Pistoles have no name,\nyoung man, and that ring has a terrible one, which may betray him who\nwears it.\"\n\n\"Sell this ring, a ring which comes from my sovereign? Never!\" said\nd'Artagnan.\n\n\"Then, at least turn the gem inside, you silly fellow; for everybody\nmust be aware that a cadet from Gascony does not find such stones in his\nmother's jewel case.\"\n\n\"You think, then, I have something to dread?\" asked d'Artagnan.\n\n\"I mean to say, young man, that he who sleeps over a mine the match of\nwhich is already lighted, may consider himself in safety in comparison\nwith you.\"\n\n\"The devil!\" said d'Artagnan, whom the positive tone of M. de Treville\nbegan to disquiet, \"the devil! What must I do?\"\n\n\"Above all things be always on your guard. The cardinal has a tenacious\nmemory and a long arm; you may depend upon it, he will repay you by some\nill turn.\"\n\n\"But of what sort?\"\n\n\"Eh! How can I tell? Has he not all the tricks of a demon at his\ncommand? The least that can be expected is that you will be arrested.\"\n\n\"What! Will they dare to arrest a man in his Majesty's service?\"\n\n\"PARDIEU! They did not scruple much in the case of Athos. At all events,\nyoung man, rely upon one who has been thirty years at court. Do not lull\nyourself in security, or you will be lost; but, on the contrary--and\nit is I who say it--see enemies in all directions. If anyone seeks a\nquarrel with you, shun it, were it with a child of ten years old. If you\nare attacked by day or by night, fight, but retreat, without shame;\nif you cross a bridge, feel every plank of it with your foot, lest one\nshould give way beneath you; if you pass before a house which is being\nbuilt, look up, for fear a stone should fall upon your head; if you\nstay out late, be always followed by your lackey, and let your lackey\nbe armed--if, by the by, you can be sure of your lackey. Mistrust\neverybody, your friend, your brother, your mistress--your mistress above\nall.\"\n\nD'Artagnan blushed.\n\n\"My mistress above all,\" repeated he, mechanically; \"and why her rather\nthan another?\"\n\n\"Because a mistress is one of the cardinal's favorite means; he has not\none that is more expeditious. A woman will sell you for ten pistoles,\nwitness Delilah. You are acquainted with the Scriptures?\"\n\nD'Artagnan thought of the appointment Mme. Bonacieux had made with him\nfor that very evening; but we are bound to say, to the credit of our\nhero, that the bad opinion entertained by M. de Treville of women in\ngeneral, did not inspire him with the least suspicion of his pretty\nhostess.\n\n\"But, A PROPOS,\" resumed M. de Treville, \"what has become of your three\ncompanions?\"\n\n\"I was about to ask you if you had heard any news of them?\"\n\n\"None, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Well, I left them on my road--Porthos at Chantilly, with a duel on his\nhands; Aramis at Crevecoeur, with a ball in his shoulder; and Athos at\nAmiens, detained by an accusation of coining.\"\n\n\"See there, now!\" said M. de Treville; \"and how the devil did you\nescape?\"\n\n\"By a miracle, monsieur, I must acknowledge, with a sword thrust in my\nbreast, and by nailing the Comte de Wardes on the byroad to Calais, like\na butterfly on a tapestry.\"\n\n\"There again! De Wardes, one of the cardinal's men, a cousin of\nRochefort! Stop, my friend, I have an idea.\"\n\n\"Speak, monsieur.\"\n\n\"In your place, I would do one thing.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"While his Eminence was seeking for me in Paris, I would take, without\nsound of drum or trumpet, the road to Picardy, and would go and make\nsome inquiries concerning my three companions. What the devil! They\nmerit richly that piece of attention on your part.\"\n\n\"The advice is good, monsieur, and tomorrow I will set out.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow! Any why not this evening?\"\n\n\"This evening, monsieur, I am detained in Paris by indispensable\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"Ah, young man, young man, some flirtation or other. Take care, I repeat\nto you, take care. It is woman who has ruined us, still ruins us, and\nwill ruin us, as long as the world stands. Take my advice and set out\nthis evening.\"\n\n\"Impossible, monsieur.\"\n\n\"You have given your word, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's quite another thing; but promise me, if you should not be\nkilled tonight, that you will go tomorrow.\"\n\n\"I promise it.\"\n\n\"Do you need money?\"\n\n\"I have still fifty pistoles. That, I think, is as much as I shall\nwant.\"\n\n\"But your companions?\"\n\n\"I don't think they can be in need of any. We left Paris, each with\nseventy-five pistoles in his pocket.\"\n\n\"Shall I see you again before your departure?\"\n\n\"I think not, monsieur, unless something new should happen.\"\n\n\"Well, a pleasant journey.\"\n\n\"Thanks, monsieur.\"\n\nD'Artagnan left M. de Treville, touched more than ever by his paternal\nsolicitude for his Musketeers.\n\nHe called successively at the abodes of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.\nNeither of them had returned. Their lackeys likewise were absent, and\nnothing had been heard of either the one or the other. He would have\ninquired after them of their mistresses, but he was neither acquainted\nwith Porthos's nor Aramis's, and as to Athos, he had none.\n\nAs he passed the Hotel des Gardes, he took a glance in to the\nstables. Three of the four horses had already arrived. Planchet, all\nastonishment, was busy grooming them, and had already finished two.\n\n\"Ah, monsieur,\" said Planchet, on perceiving d'Artagnan, \"how glad I am\nto see you.\"\n\n\"Why so, Planchet?\" asked the young man.\n\n\"Do you place confidence in our landlord--Monsieur Bonacieux?\"\n\n\"I? Not the least in the world.\"\n\n\"Oh, you do quite right, monsieur.\"\n\n\"But why this question?\"\n\n\"Because, while you were talking with him, I watched you without\nlistening to you; and, monsieur, his countenance changed color two or\nthree times!\"\n\n\"Bah!\"\n\n\"Preoccupied as Monsieur was with the letter he had received, he did not\nobserve that; but I, whom the strange fashion in which that letter came\ninto the house had placed on my guard--I did not lose a movement of his\nfeatures.\"\n\n\"And you found it?\"\n\n\"Traitorous, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"Still more; as soon as Monsieur had left and disappeared round the\ncorner of the street, Monsieur Bonacieux took his hat, shut his door,\nand set off at a quick pace in an opposite direction.\"\n\n\"It seems you are right, Planchet; all this appears to be a little\nmysterious; and be assured that we will not pay him our rent until the\nmatter shall be categorically explained to us.\"\n\n\"Monsieur jests, but Monsieur will see.\"\n\n\"What would you have, Planchet? What must come is written.\"\n\n\"Monsieur does not then renounce his excursion for this evening?\"\n\n\"Quite the contrary, Planchet; the more ill will I have toward Monsieur\nBonacieux, the more punctual I shall be in keeping the appointment made\nby that letter which makes you so uneasy.\"\n\n\"Then that is Monsieur's determination?\"\n\n\"Undeniably, my friend. At nine o'clock, then, be ready here at the\nhotel, I will come and take you.\"\n\nPlanchet seeing there was no longer any hope of making his master\nrenounce his project, heaved a profound sigh and set to work to groom\nthe third horse.\n\nAs to d'Artagnan, being at bottom a prudent youth, instead of returning\nhome, went and dined with the Gascon priest, who, at the time of the\ndistress of the four friends, had given them a breakfast of chocolate.\n\n\n\n\n24 THE PAVILION\n\nAt nine o'clock d'Artagnan was at the Hotel des Gardes; he found\nPlanchet all ready. The fourth horse had arrived.\n\nPlanchet was armed with his musketoon and a pistol. D'Artagnan had his\nsword and placed two pistols in his belt; then both mounted and departed\nquietly. It was quite dark, and no one saw them go out. Planchet took\nplace behind his master, and kept at a distance of ten paces from him.\n\nD'Artagnan crossed the quays, went out by the gate of La Conference and\nfollowed the road, much more beautiful then than it is now, which leads\nto St. Cloud.\n\nAs long as he was in the city, Planchet kept at the respectful distance\nhe had imposed upon himself; but as soon as the road began to be more\nlonely and dark, he drew softly nearer, so that when they entered the\nBois de Boulogne he found himself riding quite naturally side by side\nwith his master. In fact, we must not dissemble that the oscillation of\nthe tall trees and the reflection of the moon in the dark underwood\ngave him serious uneasiness. D'Artagnan could not help perceiving that\nsomething more than usual was passing in the mind of his lackey and\nsaid, \"Well, Monsieur Planchet, what is the matter with us now?\"\n\n\"Don't you think, monsieur, that woods are like churches?\"\n\n\"How so, Planchet?\"\n\n\"Because we dare not speak aloud in one or the other.\"\n\n\"But why did you not dare to speak aloud, Planchet--because you are\nafraid?\"\n\n\"Afraid of being heard? Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Afraid of being heard! Why, there is nothing improper in our\nconversation, my dear Planchet, and no one could find fault with it.\"\n\n\"Ah, monsieur!\" replied Planchet, recurring to his besetting idea, \"that\nMonsieur Bonacieux has something vicious in his eyebrows, and something\nvery unpleasant in the play of his lips.\"\n\n\"What the devil makes you think of Bonacieux?\"\n\n\"Monsieur, we think of what we can, and not of what we will.\"\n\n\"Because you are a coward, Planchet.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, we must not confound prudence with cowardice; prudence is a\nvirtue.\"\n\n\"And you are very virtuous, are you not, Planchet?\"\n\n\"Monsieur, is not that the barrel of a musket which glitters yonder? Had\nwe not better lower our heads?\"\n\n\"In truth,\" murmured d'Artagnan, to whom M. de Treville's recommendation\nrecurred, \"this animal will end by making me afraid.\" And he put his\nhorse into a trot.\n\nPlanchet followed the movements of his master as if he had been his\nshadow, and was soon trotting by his side.\n\n\"Are we going to continue this pace all night?\" asked Planchet.\n\n\"No; you are at your journey's end.\"\n\n\"How, monsieur! And you?\"\n\n\"I am going a few steps farther.\"\n\n\"And Monsieur leaves me here alone?\"\n\n\"You are afraid, Planchet?\"\n\n\"No; I only beg leave to observe to Monsieur that the night will be very\ncold, that chills bring on rheumatism, and that a lackey who has the\nrheumatism makes but a poor servant, particularly to a master as active\nas Monsieur.\"\n\n\"Well, if you are cold, Planchet, you can go into one of those cabarets\nthat you see yonder, and be in waiting for me at the door by six o'clock\nin the morning.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I have eaten and drunk respectfully the crown you gave me\nthis morning, so that I have not a sou left in case I should be cold.\"\n\n\"Here's half a pistole. Tomorrow morning.\"\n\nD'Artagnan sprang from his horse, threw the bridle to Planchet, and\ndeparted at a quick pace, folding his cloak around him.\n\n\"Good Lord, how cold I am!\" cried Planchet, as soon as he had lost sight\nof his master; and in such haste was he to warm himself that he went\nstraight to a house set out with all the attributes of a suburban\ntavern, and knocked at the door.\n\nIn the meantime d'Artagnan, who had plunged into a bypath, continued his\nroute and reached St. Cloud; but instead of following the main street\nhe turned behind the chateau, reached a sort of retired lane, and found\nhimself soon in front of the pavilion named. It was situated in a very\nprivate spot. A high wall, at the angle of which was the pavilion,\nran along one side of this lane, and on the other was a little garden\nconnected with a poor cottage which was protected by a hedge from\npassers-by.\n\nHe gained the place appointed, and as no signal had been given him by\nwhich to announce his presence, he waited.\n\nNot the least noise was to be heard; it might be imagined that he was\na hundred miles from the capital. D'Artagnan leaned against the hedge,\nafter having cast a glance behind it. Beyond that hedge, that garden,\nand that cottage, a dark mist enveloped with its folds that immensity\nwhere Paris slept--a vast void from which glittered a few luminous\npoints, the funeral stars of that hell!\n\nBut for d'Artagnan all aspects were clothed happily, all ideas wore\na smile, all shades were diaphanous. The appointed hour was about to\nstrike. In fact, at the end of a few minutes the belfry of St. Cloud\nlet fall slowly ten strokes from its sonorous jaws. There was something\nmelancholy in this brazen voice pouring out its lamentations in the\nmiddle of the night; but each of those strokes, which made up the\nexpected hour, vibrated harmoniously to the heart of the young man.\n\nHis eyes were fixed upon the little pavilion situated at the angle of\nthe wall, of which all the windows were closed with shutters, except\none on the first story. Through this window shone a mild light which\nsilvered the foliage of two or three linden trees which formed a group\noutside the park. There could be no doubt that behind this little\nwindow, which threw forth such friendly beams, the pretty Mme. Bonacieux\nexpected him.\n\nWrapped in this sweet idea, d'Artagnan waited half an hour without the\nleast impatience, his eyes fixed upon that charming little abode of\nwhich he could perceive a part of the ceiling with its gilded moldings,\nattesting the elegance of the rest of the apartment.\n\nThe belfry of St. Cloud sounded half past ten.\n\nThis time, without knowing why, d'Artagnan felt a cold shiver run\nthrough his veins. Perhaps the cold began to affect him, and he took a\nperfectly physical sensation for a moral impression.\n\nThen the idea seized him that he had read incorrectly, and that the\nappointment was for eleven o'clock. He drew near to the window, and\nplacing himself so that a ray of light should fall upon the letter as\nhe held it, he drew it from his pocket and read it again; but he had not\nbeen mistaken, the appointment was for ten o'clock. He went and resumed\nhis post, beginning to be rather uneasy at this silence and this\nsolitude.\n\nEleven o'clock sounded.\n\nD'Artagnan began now really to fear that something had happened to Mme.\nBonacieux. He clapped his hands three times--the ordinary signal of\nlovers; but nobody replied to him, not even an echo.\n\nHe then thought, with a touch of vexation, that perhaps the young woman\nhad fallen asleep while waiting for him. He approached the wall,\nand tried to climb it; but the wall had been recently pointed, and\nd'Artagnan could get no hold.\n\nAt that moment he thought of the trees, upon whose leaves the light\nstill shone; and as one of them drooped over the road, he thought\nthat from its branches he might get a glimpse of the interior of the\npavilion.\n\nThe tree was easy to climb. Besides, d'Artagnan was but twenty years\nold, and consequently had not yet forgotten his schoolboy habits. In an\ninstant he was among the branches, and his keen eyes plunged through the\ntransparent panes into the interior of the pavilion.\n\nIt was a strange thing, and one which made d'Artagnan tremble from the\nsole of his foot to the roots of his hair, to find that this soft light,\nthis calm lamp, enlightened a scene of fearful disorder. One of the\nwindows was broken, the door of the chamber had been beaten in and hung,\nsplit in two, on its hinges. A table, which had been covered with an\nelegant supper, was overturned. The decanters broken in pieces, and\nthe fruits crushed, strewed the floor. Everything in the apartment gave\nevidence of a violent and desperate struggle. D'Artagnan even fancied he\ncould recognize amid this strange disorder, fragments of garments, and\nsome bloody spots staining the cloth and the curtains. He hastened\nto descend into the street, with a frightful beating at his heart; he\nwished to see if he could find other traces of violence.\n\nThe little soft light shone on in the calmness of the night. d'Artagnan\nthen perceived a thing that he had not before remarked--for nothing\nhad led him to the examination--that the ground, trampled here and\nhoofmarked there, presented confused traces of men and horses. Besides,\nthe wheels of a carriage, which appeared to have come from Paris, had\nmade a deep impression in the soft earth, which did not extend beyond\nthe pavilion, but turned again toward Paris.\n\nAt length d'Artagnan, in pursuing his researches, found near the wall\na woman's torn glove. This glove, wherever it had not touched the muddy\nground, was of irreproachable odor. It was one of those perfumed gloves\nthat lovers like to snatch from a pretty hand.\n\nAs d'Artagnan pursued his investigations, a more abundant and more icy\nsweat rolled in large drops from his forehead; his heart was oppressed\nby a horrible anguish; his respiration was broken and short. And yet\nhe said, to reassure himself, that this pavilion perhaps had nothing in\ncommon with Mme. Bonacieux; that the young woman had made an appointment\nwith him before the pavilion, and not in the pavilion; that she might\nhave been detained in Paris by her duties, or perhaps by the jealousy of\nher husband.\n\nBut all these reasons were combated, destroyed, overthrown, by that\nfeeling of intimate pain which, on certain occasions, takes possession\nof our being, and cries to us so as to be understood unmistakably that\nsome great misfortune is hanging over us.\n\nThen d'Artagnan became almost wild. He ran along the high road, took\nthe path he had before taken, and reaching the ferry, interrogated the\nboatman.\n\nAbout seven o'clock in the evening, the boatman had taken over a young\nwoman, wrapped in a black mantle, who appeared to be very anxious not to\nbe recognized; but entirely on account of her precautions, the boatman\nhad paid more attention to her and discovered that she was young and\npretty.\n\nThere were then, as now, a crowd of young and pretty women who came to\nSt. Cloud, and who had reasons for not being seen, and yet d'Artagnan\ndid not for an instant doubt that it was Mme. Bonacieux whom the boatman\nhad noticed.\n\nD'Artagnan took advantage of the lamp which burned in the cabin of the\nferryman to read the billet of Mme. Bonacieux once again, and satisfy\nhimself that he had not been mistaken, that the appointment was at St.\nCloud and not elsewhere, before the D'Estrees's pavilion and not in\nanother street. Everything conspired to prove to d'Artagnan that his\npresentiments had not deceived him, and that a great misfortune had\nhappened.\n\nHe again ran back to the chateau. It appeared to him that something\nmight have happened at the pavilion in his absence, and that fresh\ninformation awaited him. The lane was still deserted, and the same calm\nsoft light shone through the window.\n\nD'Artagnan then thought of that cottage, silent and obscure, which had\nno doubt seen all, and could tell its tale. The gate of the enclosure\nwas shut; but he leaped over the hedge, and in spite of the barking of a\nchained-up dog, went up to the cabin.\n\nNo one answered to his first knocking. A silence of death reigned in\nthe cabin as in the pavilion; but as the cabin was his last resource, he\nknocked again.\n\nIt soon appeared to him that he heard a slight noise within--a timid\nnoise which seemed to tremble lest it should be heard.\n\nThen d'Artagnan ceased knocking, and prayed with an accent so full\nof anxiety and promises, terror and cajolery, that his voice was of\na nature to reassure the most fearful. At length an old, worm-eaten\nshutter was opened, or rather pushed ajar, but closed again as soon as\nthe light from a miserable lamp which burned in the corner had shone\nupon the baldric, sword belt, and pistol pommels of d'Artagnan.\nNevertheless, rapid as the movement had been, d'Artagnan had had time to\nget a glimpse of the head of an old man.\n\n\"In the name of heaven!\" cried he, \"listen to me; I have been waiting\nfor someone who has not come. I am dying with anxiety. Has anything\nparticular happened in the neighborhood? Speak!\"\n\nThe window was again opened slowly, and the same face appeared, only it\nwas now still more pale than before.\n\nD'Artagnan related his story simply, with the omission of names. He told\nhow he had a rendezvous with a young woman before that pavilion, and\nhow, not seeing her come, he had climbed the linden tree, and by the\nlight of the lamp had seen the disorder of the chamber.\n\nThe old man listened attentively, making a sign only that it was all so;\nand then, when d'Artagnan had ended, he shook his head with an air that\nannounced nothing good.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" cried d'Artagnan. \"In the name of heaven, explain\nyourself!\"\n\n\"Oh! Monsieur,\" said the old man, \"ask me nothing; for if I dared tell\nyou what I have seen, certainly no good would befall me.\"\n\n\"You have, then, seen something?\" replied d'Artagnan. \"In that case, in\nthe name of heaven,\" continued he, throwing him a pistole, \"tell me what\nyou have seen, and I will pledge you the word of a gentleman that not\none of your words shall escape from my heart.\"\n\nThe old man read so much truth and so much grief in the face of the\nyoung man that he made him a sign to listen, and repeated in a low\nvoice: \"It was scarcely nine o'clock when I heard a noise in the street,\nand was wondering what it could be, when on coming to my door, I found\nthat somebody was endeavoring to open it. As I am very poor and am not\nafraid of being robbed, I went and opened the gate and saw three men at\na few paces from it. In the shadow was a carriage with two horses, and\nsome saddlehorses. These horses evidently belonged to the three men, who\nwere dressed as cavaliers. 'Ah, my worthy gentlemen,' cried I, 'what\ndo you want?' 'You must have a ladder?' said he who appeared to be the\nleader of the party. 'Yes, monsieur, the one with which I gather my\nfruit.' 'Lend it to us, and go into your house again; there is a crown\nfor the annoyance we have caused you. Only remember this--if you speak a\nword of what you may see or what you may hear (for you will look and\nyou will listen, I am quite sure, however we may threaten you), you are\nlost.' At these words he threw me a crown, which I picked up, and he\ntook the ladder. After shutting the gate behind them, I pretended\nto return to the house, but I immediately went out a back door, and\nstealing along in the shade of the hedge, I gained yonder clump of\nelder, from which I could hear and see everything. The three men brought\nthe carriage up quietly, and took out of it a little man, stout, short,\nelderly, and commonly dressed in clothes of a dark color, who ascended\nthe ladder very carefully, looked suspiciously in at the window of the\npavilion, came down as quietly as he had gone up, and whispered, 'It is\nshe!' Immediately, he who had spoken to me approached the door of the\npavilion, opened it with a key he had in his hand, closed the door\nand disappeared, while at the same time the other two men ascended the\nladder. The little old man remained at the coach door; the coachman took\ncare of his horses, the lackey held the saddlehorses. All at once great\ncries resounded in the pavilion, and a woman came to the window,\nand opened it, as if to throw herself out of it; but as soon as she\nperceived the other two men, she fell back and they went into the\nchamber. Then I saw no more; but I heard the noise of breaking\nfurniture. The woman screamed, and cried for help; but her cries were\nsoon stifled. Two of the men appeared, bearing the woman in their arms,\nand carried her to the carriage, into which the little old man got after\nher. The leader closed the window, came out an instant after by the\ndoor, and satisfied himself that the woman was in the carriage. His two\ncompanions were already on horseback. He sprang into his saddle; the\nlackey took his place by the coachman; the carriage went off at a quick\npace, escorted by the three horsemen, and all was over. From that moment\nI have neither seen nor heard anything.\"\n\nD'Artagnan, entirely overcome by this terrible story, remained\nmotionless and mute, while all the demons of anger and jealousy were\nhowling in his heart.\n\n\"But, my good gentleman,\" resumed the old man, upon whom this mute\ndespair certainly produced a greater effect than cries and tears would\nhave done, \"do not take on so; they did not kill her, and that's a\ncomfort.\"\n\n\"Can you guess,\" said d'Artagnan, \"who was the man who headed this\ninfernal expedition?\"\n\n\"I don't know him.\"\n\n\"But as you spoke to him you must have seen him.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's a description you want?\"\n\n\"Exactly so.\"\n\n\"A tall, dark man, with black mustaches, dark eyes, and the air of a\ngentleman.\"\n\n\"That's the man!\" cried d'Artagnan, \"again he, forever he! He is my\ndemon, apparently. And the other?\"\n\n\"Which?\"\n\n\"The short one.\"\n\n\"Oh, he was not a gentleman, I'll answer for it; besides, he did not\nwear a sword, and the others treated him with small consideration.\"\n\n\"Some lackey,\" murmured d'Artagnan. \"Poor woman, poor woman, what have\nthey done with you?\"\n\n\"You have promised to be secret, my good monsieur?\" said the old man.\n\n\"And I renew my promise. Be easy, I am a gentleman. A gentleman has but\nhis word, and I have given you mine.\"\n\nWith a heavy heart, d'Artagnan again bent his way toward the ferry.\nSometimes he hoped it could not be Mme. Bonacieux, and that he should\nfind her next day at the Louvre; sometimes he feared she had had an\nintrigue with another, who, in a jealous fit, had surprised her and\ncarried her off. His mind was torn by doubt, grief, and despair.\n\n\"Oh, if I had my three friends here,\" cried he, \"I should have, at\nleast, some hopes of finding her; but who knows what has become of\nthem?\"\n\nIt was past midnight; the next thing was to find Planchet. d'Artagnan\nwent successively into all the cabarets in which there was a light, but\ncould not find Planchet in any of them.\n\nAt the sixth he began to reflect that the search was rather dubious.\nD'Artagnan had appointed six o'clock in the morning for his lackey, and\nwherever he might be, he was right.\n\nBesides, it came into the young man's mind that by remaining in the\nenvirons of the spot on which this sad event had passed, he would,\nperhaps, have some light thrown upon the mysterious affair. At the sixth\ncabaret, then, as we said, d'Artagnan stopped, asked for a bottle of\nwine of the best quality, and placing himself in the darkest corner of\nthe room, determined thus to wait till daylight; but this time again his\nhopes were disappointed, and although he listened with all his ears,\nhe heard nothing, amid the oaths, coarse jokes, and abuse which passed\nbetween the laborers, servants, and carters who comprised the honorable\nsociety of which he formed a part, which could put him upon the least\ntrack of her who had been stolen from him. He was compelled, then, after\nhaving swallowed the contents of his bottle, to pass the time as well as\nto evade suspicion, to fall into the easiest position in his corner and\nto sleep, whether well or ill. D'Artagnan, be it remembered, was only\ntwenty years old, and at that age sleep has its imprescriptible rights\nwhich it imperiously insists upon, even with the saddest hearts.\n\nToward six o'clock d'Artagnan awoke with that uncomfortable feeling\nwhich generally accompanies the break of day after a bad night. He was\nnot long in making his toilet. He examined himself to see if advantage\nhad been taken of his sleep, and having found his diamond ring on his\nfinger, his purse in his pocket, and his pistols in his belt, he rose,\npaid for his bottle, and went out to try if he could have any better\nluck in his search after his lackey than he had had the night before.\nThe first thing he perceived through the damp gray mist was honest\nPlanchet, who, with the two horses in hand, awaited him at the door of a\nlittle blind cabaret, before which d'Artagnan had passed without even a\nsuspicion of its existence.\n\n\n\n\n25 PORTHOS\n\nInstead of returning directly home, d'Artagnan alighted at the door of\nM. de Treville, and ran quickly up the stairs. This time he had decided\nto relate all that had passed. M. de Treville would doubtless give him\ngood advice as to the whole affair. Besides, as M. de Treville saw\nthe queen almost daily, he might be able to draw from her Majesty some\nintelligence of the poor young woman, whom they were doubtless making\npay very dearly for her devotedness to her mistress.\n\nM. de Treville listened to the young man's account with a seriousness\nwhich proved that he saw something else in this adventure besides a love\naffair. When d'Artagnan had finished, he said, \"Hum! All this savors of\nhis Eminence, a league off.\"\n\n\"But what is to be done?\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Nothing, absolutely nothing, at present, but quitting Paris, as I told\nyou, as soon as possible. I will see the queen; I will relate to her\nthe details of the disappearance of this poor woman, of which she is no\ndoubt ignorant. These details will guide her on her part, and on your\nreturn, I shall perhaps have some good news to tell you. Rely on me.\"\n\nD'Artagnan knew that, although a Gascon, M. de Treville was not in the\nhabit of making promises, and that when by chance he did promise, he\nmore than kept his word. He bowed to him, then, full of gratitude for\nthe past and for the future; and the worthy captain, who on his side\nfelt a lively interest in this young man, so brave and so resolute,\npressed his hand kindly, wishing him a pleasant journey.\n\nDetermined to put the advice of M. de Treville in practice instantly,\nd'Artagnan directed his course toward the Rue des Fossoyeurs, in order\nto superintend the packing of his valise. On approaching the house, he\nperceived M. Bonacieux in morning costume, standing at his threshold.\nAll that the prudent Planchet had said to him the preceding evening\nabout the sinister character of the old man recurred to the mind of\nd'Artagnan, who looked at him with more attention than he had done\nbefore. In fact, in addition to that yellow, sickly paleness which\nindicates the insinuation of the bile in the blood, and which might,\nbesides, be accidental, d'Artagnan remarked something perfidiously\nsignificant in the play of the wrinkled features of his countenance.\nA rogue does not laugh in the same way that an honest man does; a\nhypocrite does not shed the tears of a man of good faith. All falsehood\nis a mask; and however well made the mask may be, with a little\nattention we may always succeed in distinguishing it from the true face.\n\nIt appeared, then, to d'Artagnan that M. Bonacieux wore a mask,\nand likewise that that mask was most disagreeable to look upon. In\nconsequence of this feeling of repugnance, he was about to pass without\nspeaking to him, but, as he had done the day before, M. Bonacieux\naccosted him.\n\n\"Well, young man,\" said he, \"we appear to pass rather gay nights! Seven\no'clock in the morning! PESTE! You seem to reverse ordinary customs, and\ncome home at the hour when other people are going out.\"\n\n\"No one can reproach you for anything of the kind, Monsieur Bonacieux,\"\nsaid the young man; \"you are a model for regular people. It is true that\nwhen a man possesses a young and pretty wife, he has no need to seek\nhappiness elsewhere. Happiness comes to meet him, does it not, Monsieur\nBonacieux?\"\n\nBonacieux became as pale as death, and grinned a ghastly smile.\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" said Bonacieux, \"you are a jocular companion! But where the\ndevil were you gladding last night, my young master? It does not appear\nto be very clean in the crossroads.\"\n\nD'Artagnan glanced down at his boots, all covered with mud; but that\nsame glance fell upon the shoes and stockings of the mercer, and it\nmight have been said they had been dipped in the same mud heap. Both\nwere stained with splashes of mud of the same appearance.\n\nThen a sudden idea crossed the mind of d'Artagnan. That little stout\nman, short and elderly, that sort of lackey, dressed in dark clothes,\ntreated without ceremony by the men wearing swords who composed the\nescort, was Bonacieux himself. The husband had presided at the abduction\nof his wife.\n\nA terrible inclination seized d'Artagnan to grasp the mercer by the\nthroat and strangle him; but, as we have said, he was a very prudent\nyouth, and he restrained himself. However, the revolution which appeared\nupon his countenance was so visible that Bonacieux was terrified at it,\nand he endeavored to draw back a step or two; but as he was standing\nbefore the half of the door which was shut, the obstacle compelled him\nto keep his place.\n\n\"Ah, but you are joking, my worthy man!\" said d'Artagnan. \"It appears\nto me that if my boots need a sponge, your stockings and shoes stand in\nequal need of a brush. May you not have been philandering a little also,\nMonsieur Bonacieux? Oh, the devil! That's unpardonable in a man of your\nage, and who besides, has such a pretty wife as yours.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lord! no,\" said Bonacieux, \"but yesterday I went to St. Mande to\nmake some inquiries after a servant, as I cannot possibly do without\none; and the roads were so bad that I brought back all this mud, which I\nhave not yet had time to remove.\"\n\nThe place named by Bonacieux as that which had been the object of his\njourney was a fresh proof in support of the suspicions d'Artagnan had\nconceived. Bonacieux had named Mande because Mande was in an exactly\nopposite direction from St. Cloud. This probability afforded him his\nfirst consolation. If Bonacieux knew where his wife was, one might, by\nextreme means, force the mercer to open his teeth and let his secret\nescape. The question, then, was how to change this probability into a\ncertainty.\n\n\"Pardon, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux, if I don't stand upon ceremony,\"\nsaid d'Artagnan, \"but nothing makes one so thirsty as want of sleep.\nI am parched with thirst. Allow me to take a glass of water in your\napartment; you know that is never refused among neighbors.\"\n\nWithout waiting for the permission of his host, d'Artagnan went quickly\ninto the house, and cast a rapid glance at the bed. It had not been\nused. Bonacieux had not been abed. He had only been back an hour or two;\nhe had accompanied his wife to the place of her confinement, or else at\nleast to the first relay.\n\n\"Thanks, Monsieur Bonacieux,\" said d'Artagnan, emptying his glass, \"that\nis all I wanted of you. I will now go up into my apartment. I will make\nPlanchet brush my boots; and when he has done, I will, if you like, send\nhim to you to brush your shoes.\"\n\nHe left the mercer quite astonished at his singular farewell, and asking\nhimself if he had not been a little inconsiderate.\n\nAt the top of the stairs he found Planchet in a great fright.\n\n\"Ah, monsieur!\" cried Planchet, as soon as he perceived his master,\n\"here is more trouble. I thought you would never come in.\"\n\n\"What's the matter now, Planchet?\" demanded d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Oh! I give you a hundred, I give you a thousand times to guess,\nmonsieur, the visit I received in your absence.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"About half an hour ago, while you were at Monsieur de Treville's.\"\n\n\"Who has been here? Come, speak.\"\n\n\"Monsieur de Cavois.\"\n\n\"Monsieur de Cavois?\"\n\n\"In person.\"\n\n\"The captain of the cardinal's Guards?\"\n\n\"Himself.\"\n\n\"Did he come to arrest me?\"\n\n\"I have no doubt that he did, monsieur, for all his wheedling manner.\"\n\n\"Was he so sweet, then?\"\n\n\"Indeed, he was all honey, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"He came, he said, on the part of his Eminence, who wished you well, and\nto beg you to follow him to the Palais-Royal.\" [*]\n\n     *It was called the Palais-Cardinal before Richelieu gave it\n     to the King.\n\n\"What did you answer him?\"\n\n\"That the thing was impossible, seeing that you were not at home, as he\ncould see.\"\n\n\"Well, what did he say then?\"\n\n\"That you must not fail to call upon him in the course of the day; and\nthen he added in a low voice, 'Tell your master that his Eminence is\nvery well disposed toward him, and that his fortune perhaps depends upon\nthis interview.'\"\n\n\"The snare is rather MALADROIT for the cardinal,\" replied the young man,\nsmiling.\n\n\"Oh, I saw the snare, and I answered you would be quite in despair on\nyour return.\n\n\"'Where has he gone?' asked Monsieur de Cavois.\n\n\"'To Troyes, in Champagne,' I answered.\n\n\"'And when did he set out?'\n\n\"'Yesterday evening.'\"\n\n\"Planchet, my friend,\" interrupted d'Artagnan, \"you are really a\nprecious fellow.\"\n\n\"You will understand, monsieur, I thought there would be still time, if\nyou wish, to see Monsieur de Cavois to contradict me by saying you were\nnot yet gone. The falsehood would then lie at my door, and as I am not a\ngentleman, I may be allowed to lie.\"\n\n\"Be of good heart, Planchet, you shall preserve your reputation as a\nveracious man. In a quarter of an hour we set off.\"\n\n\"That's the advice I was about to give Monsieur; and where are we going,\nmay I ask, without being too curious?\"\n\n\"PARDIEU! In the opposite direction to that which you said I was gone.\nBesides, are you not as anxious to learn news of Grimaud, Mousqueton,\nand Bazin as I am to know what has become of Athos, Porthos, and\nAramis?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" said Planchet, \"and I will go as soon as you please.\nIndeed, I think provincial air will suit us much better just now than\nthe air of Paris. So then--\"\n\n\"So then, pack up our luggage, Planchet, and let us be off. On my\npart, I will go out with my hands in my pockets, that nothing may\nbe suspected. You may join me at the Hotel des Gardes. By the way,\nPlanchet, I think you are right with respect to our host, and that he is\ndecidedly a frightfully low wretch.\"\n\n\"Ah, monsieur, you may take my word when I tell you anything. I am a\nphysiognomist, I assure you.\"\n\nD'Artagnan went out first, as had been agreed upon. Then, in order that\nhe might have nothing to reproach himself with, he directed his steps,\nfor the last time, toward the residences of his three friends. No news\nhad been received of them; only a letter, all perfumed and of an elegant\nwriting in small characters, had come for Aramis. D'Artagnan took charge\nof it. Ten minutes afterward Planchet joined him at the stables of the\nHotel des Gardes. D'Artagnan, in order that there might be no time lost,\nhad saddled his horse himself.\n\n\"That's well,\" said he to Planchet, when the latter added the\nportmanteau to the equipment. \"Now saddle the other three horses.\"\n\n\"Do you think, then, monsieur, that we shall travel faster with two\nhorses apiece?\" said Planchet, with his shrewd air.\n\n\"No, Monsieur Jester,\" replied d'Artagnan; \"but with our four horses we\nmay bring back our three friends, if we should have the good fortune to\nfind them living.\"\n\n\"Which is a great chance,\" replied Planchet, \"but we must not despair of\nthe mercy of God.\"\n\n\"Amen!\" said d'Artagnan, getting into his saddle.\n\nAs they went from the Hotel des Gardes, they separated, leaving the\nstreet at opposite ends, one having to quit Paris by the Barriere de la\nVillette and the other by the Barriere Montmartre, to meet again beyond\nSt. Denis--a strategic maneuver which, having been executed with equal\npunctuality, was crowned with the most fortunate results. D'Artagnan and\nPlanchet entered Pierrefitte together.\n\nPlanchet was more courageous, it must be admitted, by day than by night.\nHis natural prudence, however, never forsook him for a single instant.\nHe had forgotten not one of the incidents of the first journey, and he\nlooked upon everybody he met on the road as an enemy. It followed\nthat his hat was forever in his hand, which procured him some severe\nreprimands from d'Artagnan, who feared that his excess of politeness\nwould lead people to think he was the lackey of a man of no consequence.\n\nNevertheless, whether the passengers were really touched by the urbanity\nof Planchet or whether this time nobody was posted on the young man's\nroad, our two travelers arrived at Chantilly without any accident, and\nalighted at the tavern of Great St. Martin, the same at which they had\nstopped on their first journey.\n\nThe host, on seeing a young man followed by a lackey with two extra\nhorses, advanced respectfully to the door. Now, as they had already\ntraveled eleven leagues, d'Artagnan thought it time to stop, whether\nPorthos were or were not in the inn. Perhaps it would not be prudent\nto ask at once what had become of the Musketeer. The result of these\nreflections was that d'Artagnan, without asking information of any kind,\nalighted, commended the horses to the care of his lackey, entered a\nsmall room destined to receive those who wished to be alone, and desired\nthe host to bring him a bottle of his best wine and as good a breakfast\nas possible--a desire which further corroborated the high opinion the\ninnkeeper had formed of the traveler at first sight.\n\nD'Artagnan was therefore served with miraculous celerity. The regiment\nof the Guards was recruited among the first gentlemen of the kingdom;\nand d'Artagnan, followed by a lackey, and traveling with four\nmagnificent horses, despite the simplicity of his uniform, could not\nfail to make a sensation. The host desired himself to serve him; which\nd'Artagnan perceiving, ordered two glasses to be brought, and commenced\nthe following conversation.\n\n\"My faith, my good host,\" said d'Artagnan, filling the two glasses, \"I\nasked for a bottle of your best wine, and if you have deceived me,\nyou will be punished in what you have sinned; for seeing that I hate\ndrinking my myself, you shall drink with me. Take your glass, then, and\nlet us drink. But what shall we drink to, so as to avoid wounding any\nsusceptibility? Let us drink to the prosperity of your establishment.\"\n\n\"Your Lordship does me much honor,\" said the host, \"and I thank you\nsincerely for your kind wish.\"\n\n\"But don't mistake,\" said d'Artagnan, \"there is more selfishness in\nmy toast than perhaps you may think--for it is only in prosperous\nestablishments that one is well received. In hotels that do not\nflourish, everything is in confusion, and the traveler is a victim to\nthe embarrassments of his host. Now, I travel a great deal, particularly\non this road, and I wish to see all innkeepers making a fortune.\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" said the host, \"that this is not the first time I have\nhad the honor of seeing Monsieur.\"\n\n\"Bah, I have passed perhaps ten times through Chantilly, and out of the\nten times I have stopped three or four times at your house at least. Why\nI was here only ten or twelve days ago. I was conducting some friends,\nMusketeers, one of whom, by the by, had a dispute with a stranger--a man\nwho sought a quarrel with him, for I don't know what.\"\n\n\"Exactly so,\" said the host; \"I remember it perfectly. It is not\nMonsieur Porthos that your Lordship means?\"\n\n\"Yes, that is my companion's name. My God, my dear host, tell me if\nanything has happened to him?\"\n\n\"Your Lordship must have observed that he could not continue his\njourney.\"\n\n\"Why, to be sure, he promised to rejoin us, and we have seen nothing of\nhim.\"\n\n\"He has done us the honor to remain here.\"\n\n\"What, he had done you the honor to remain here?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, in this house; and we are even a little uneasy--\"\n\n\"On what account?\"\n\n\"Of certain expenses he has contracted.\"\n\n\"Well, but whatever expenses he may have incurred, I am sure he is in a\ncondition to pay them.\"\n\n\"Ah, monsieur, you infuse genuine balm into my blood. We have made\nconsiderable advances; and this very morning the surgeon declared that\nif Monsieur Porthos did not pay him, he should look to me, as it was I\nwho had sent for him.\"\n\n\"Porthos is wounded, then?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you, monsieur.\"\n\n\"What! You cannot tell me? Surely you ought to be able to tell me better\nthan any other person.\"\n\n\"Yes; but in our situation we must not say all we know--particularly as\nwe have been warned that our ears should answer for our tongues.\"\n\n\"Well, can I see Porthos?\"\n\n\"Certainly, monsieur. Take the stairs on your right; go up the first\nflight and knock at Number One. Only warn him that it is you.\"\n\n\"Why should I do that?\"\n\n\"Because, monsieur, some mischief might happen to you.\"\n\n\"Of what kind, in the name of wonder?\"\n\n\"Monsieur Porthos may imagine you belong to the house, and in a fit of\npassion might run his sword through you or blow out your brains.\"\n\n\"What have you done to him, then?\"\n\n\"We have asked him for money.\"\n\n\"The devil! Ah, I can understand that. It is a demand that Porthos takes\nvery ill when he is not in funds; but I know he must be so at present.\"\n\n\"We thought so, too, monsieur. As our house is carried on very\nregularly, and we make out our bills every week, at the end of eight\ndays we presented our account; but it appeared we had chosen an unlucky\nmoment, for at the first word on the subject, he sent us to all the\ndevils. It is true he had been playing the day before.\"\n\n\"Playing the day before! And with whom?\"\n\n\"Lord, who can say, monsieur? With some gentleman who was traveling this\nway, to whom he proposed a game of LANSQUENET.\"\n\n\"That's it, then, and the foolish fellow lost all he had?\"\n\n\"Even to his horse, monsieur; for when the gentleman was about to set\nout, we perceived that his lackey was saddling Monsieur Porthos's horse,\nas well as his master's. When we observed this to him, he told us all to\ntrouble ourselves about our own business, as this horse belonged to him.\nWe also informed Monsieur Porthos of what was going on; but he told us\nwe were scoundrels to doubt a gentleman's word, and that as he had said\nthe horse was his, it must be so.\"\n\n\"That's Porthos all over,\" murmured d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Then,\" continued the host, \"I replied that as from the moment we seemed\nnot likely to come to a good understanding with respect to payment, I\nhoped that he would have at least the kindness to grant the favor of\nhis custom to my brother host of the Golden Eagle; but Monsieur Porthos\nreplied that, my house being the best, he should remain where he was.\nThis reply was too flattering to allow me to insist on his departure. I\nconfined myself then to begging him to give up his chamber, which is the\nhandsomest in the hotel, and to be satisfied with a pretty little room\non the third floor; but to this Monsieur Porthos replied that as he\nevery moment expected his mistress, who was one of the greatest ladies\nin the court, I might easily comprehend that the chamber he did me the\nhonor to occupy in my house was itself very mean for the visit of such a\npersonage. Nevertheless, while acknowledging the truth of what he said,\nI thought proper to insist; but without even giving himself the trouble\nto enter into any discussion with me, he took one of his pistols, laid\nit on his table, day and night, and said that at the first word that\nshould be spoken to him about removing, either within the house or\nout of it, he would blow out the brains of the person who should be so\nimprudent as to meddle with a matter which only concerned himself. Since\nthat time, monsieur, nobody entered his chamber but his servant.\"\n\n\"What! Mousqueton is here, then?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, monsieur. Five days after your departure, he came back, and\nin a very bad condition, too. It appears that he had met with\ndisagreeableness, likewise, on his journey. Unfortunately, he is more\nnimble than his master; so that for the sake of his master, he puts us\nall under his feet, and as he thinks we might refuse what he asked for,\nhe takes all he wants without asking at all.\"\n\n\"The fact is,\" said d'Artagnan, \"I have always observed a great degree\nof intelligence and devotedness in Mousqueton.\"\n\n\"That is possible, monsieur; but suppose I should happen to be\nbrought in contact, even four times a year, with such intelligence and\ndevotedness--why, I should be a ruined man!\"\n\n\"No, for Porthos will pay you.\"\n\n\"Hum!\" said the host, in a doubtful tone.\n\n\"The favorite of a great lady will not be allowed to be inconvenienced\nfor such a paltry sum as he owes you.\"\n\n\"If I durst say what I believe on that head--\"\n\n\"What you believe?\"\n\n\"I ought rather to say, what I know.\"\n\n\"What you know?\"\n\n\"And even what I am sure of.\"\n\n\"And of what are you so sure?\"\n\n\"I would say that I know this great lady.\"\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"Yes; I.\"\n\n\"And how do you know her?\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur, if I could believe I might trust in your discretion.\"\n\n\"Speak! By the word of a gentleman, you shall have no cause to repent of\nyour confidence.\"\n\n\"Well, monsieur, you understand that uneasiness makes us do many\nthings.\"\n\n\"What have you done?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing which was not right in the character of a creditor.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Monsieur Porthos gave us a note for his duchess, ordering us to put it\nin the post. This was before his servant came. As he could not leave his\nchamber, it was necessary to charge us with this commission.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Instead of putting the letter in the post, which is never safe, I took\nadvantage of the journey of one of my lads to Paris, and ordered him\nto convey the letter to this duchess himself. This was fulfilling the\nintentions of Monsieur Porthos, who had desired us to be so careful of\nthis letter, was it not?\"\n\n\"Nearly so.\"\n\n\"Well, monsieur, do you know who this great lady is?\"\n\n\"No; I have heard Porthos speak of her, that's all.\"\n\n\"Do you know who this pretended duchess is?\n\n\"I repeat to you, I don't know her.\"\n\n\"Why, she is the old wife of a procurator* of the Chatelet, monsieur,\nnamed Madame Coquenard, who, although she is at least fifty, still gives\nherself jealous airs. It struck me as very odd that a princess should\nlive in the Rue aux Ours.\"\n\n*Attorney\n\n\"But how do you know all this?\"\n\n\"Because she flew into a great passion on receiving the letter, saying\nthat Monsieur Porthos was a weathercock, and that she was sure it was\nfor some woman he had received this wound.\"\n\n\"Has he been wounded, then?\"\n\n\"Oh, good Lord! What have I said?\"\n\n\"You said that Porthos had received a sword cut.\"\n\n\"Yes, but he has forbidden me so strictly to say so.\"\n\n\"And why so.\"\n\n\"Zounds, monsieur! Because he had boasted that he would perforate the\nstranger with whom you left him in dispute; whereas the stranger, on\nthe contrary, in spite of all his rodomontades quickly threw him on his\nback. As Monsieur Porthos is a very boastful man, he insists that\nnobody shall know he has received this wound except the duchess, whom he\nendeavored to interest by an account of his adventure.\"\n\n\"It is a wound that confines him to his bed?\"\n\n\"Ah, and a master stroke, too, I assure you. Your friend's soul must\nstick tight to his body.\"\n\n\"Were you there, then?\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I followed them from curiosity, so that I saw the combat\nwithout the combatants seeing me.\"\n\n\"And what took place?\"\n\n\"Oh! The affair was not long, I assure you. They placed themselves on\nguard; the stranger made a feint and a lunge, and that so rapidly that\nwhen Monsieur Porthos came to the PARADE, he had already three inches of\nsteel in his breast. He immediately fell backward. The stranger placed\nthe point of his sword at his throat; and Monsieur Porthos, finding\nhimself at the mercy of his adversary, acknowledged himself conquered.\nUpon which the stranger asked his name, and learning that it was\nPorthos, and not d'Artagnan, he assisted him to rise, brought him back\nto the hotel, mounted his horse, and disappeared.\"\n\n\"So it was with Monsieur d'Artagnan this stranger meant to quarrel?\"\n\n\"It appears so.\"\n\n\"And do you know what has become of him?\"\n\n\"No, I never saw him until that moment, and have not seen him since.\"\n\n\"Very well; I know all that I wish to know. Porthos's chamber is, you\nsay, on the first story, Number One?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, the handsomest in the inn--a chamber that I could have\nlet ten times over.\"\n\n\"Bah! Be satisfied,\" said d'Artagnan, laughing, \"Porthos will pay you\nwith the money of the Duchess Coquenard.\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur, procurator's wife or duchess, if she will but loosen her\npursestrings, it will be all the same; but she positively answered that\nshe was tired of the exigencies and infidelities of Monsieur Porthos,\nand that she would not send him a denier.\"\n\n\"And did you convey this answer to your guest?\"\n\n\"We took good care not to do that; he would have found in what fashion\nwe had executed his commission.\"\n\n\"So that he still expects his money?\"\n\n\"Oh, Lord, yes, monsieur! Yesterday he wrote again; but it was his\nservant who this time put the letter in the post.\"\n\n\"Do you say the procurator's wife is old and ugly?\"\n\n\"Fifty at least, monsieur, and not at all handsome, according to\nPathaud's account.\"\n\n\"In that case, you may be quite at ease; she will soon be softened.\nBesides, Porthos cannot owe you much.\"\n\n\"How, not much! Twenty good pistoles, already, without reckoning the\ndoctor. He denies himself nothing; it may easily be seen he has been\naccustomed to live well.\"\n\n\"Never mind; if his mistress abandons him, he will find friends, I will\nanswer for it. So, my dear host, be not uneasy, and continue to take all\nthe care of him that his situation requires.\"\n\n\"Monsieur has promised me not to open his mouth about the procurator's\nwife, and not to say a word of the wound?\"\n\n\"That's agreed; you have my word.\"\n\n\"Oh, he would kill me!\"\n\n\"Don't be afraid; he is not so much of a devil as he appears.\"\n\nSaying these words, d'Artagnan went upstairs, leaving his host a little\nbetter satisfied with respect to two things in which he appeared to be\nvery much interested--his debt and his life.\n\nAt the top of the stairs, upon the most conspicuous door of the\ncorridor, was traced in black ink a gigantic number \"1.\" d'Artagnan\nknocked, and upon the bidding to come in which came from inside, he\nentered the chamber.\n\nPorthos was in bed, and was playing a game at LANSQUENET with\nMousqueton, to keep his hand in; while a spit loaded with partridges was\nturning before the fire, and on each side of a large chimneypiece, over\ntwo chafing dishes, were boiling two stewpans, from which exhaled\na double odor of rabbit and fish stews, rejoicing to the smell. In\naddition to this he perceived that the top of a wardrobe and the marble\nof a commode were covered with empty bottles.\n\nAt the sight of his friend, Porthos uttered a loud cry of joy; and\nMousqueton, rising respectfully, yielded his place to him, and went\nto give an eye to the two stewpans, of which he appeared to have the\nparticular inspection.\n\n\"Ah, PARDIEU! Is that you?\" said Porthos to d'Artagnan. \"You are right\nwelcome. Excuse my not coming to meet you; but,\" added he, looking\nat d'Artagnan with a certain degree of uneasiness, \"you know what has\nhappened to me?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Has the host told you nothing, then?\"\n\n\"I asked after you, and came up as soon as I could.\"\n\nPorthos seemed to breathe more freely.\n\n\"And what has happened to you, my dear Porthos?\" continued d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Why, on making a thrust at my adversary, whom I had already hit three\ntimes, and whom I meant to finish with the fourth, I put my foot on a\nstone, slipped, and strained my knee.\"\n\n\"Truly?\"\n\n\"Honor! Luckily for the rascal, for I should have left him dead on the\nspot, I assure you.\"\n\n\"And what has became of him?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know; he had enough, and set off without waiting for the\nrest. But you, my dear d'Artagnan, what has happened to you?\"\n\n\"So that this strain of the knee,\" continued d'Artagnan, \"my dear\nPorthos, keeps you in bed?\"\n\n\"My God, that's all. I shall be about again in a few days.\"\n\n\"Why did you not have yourself conveyed to Paris? You must be cruelly\nbored here.\"\n\n\"That was my intention; but, my dear friend, I have one thing to confess\nto you.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"It is that as I was cruelly bored, as you say, and as I had the\nseventy-five pistoles in my pocket which you had distributed to me, in\norder to amuse myself I invited a gentleman who was traveling this way\nto walk up, and proposed a cast of dice. He accepted my challenge, and,\nmy faith, my seventy-five pistoles passed from my pocket to his, without\nreckoning my horse, which he won into the bargain. But you, my dear\nd'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"What can you expect, my dear Porthos; a man is not privileged in all\nways,\" said d'Artagnan. \"You know the proverb 'Unlucky at play, lucky\nin love.' You are too fortunate in your love for play not to take its\nrevenge. What consequence can the reverses of fortune be to you? Have\nyou not, happy rogue that you are--have you not your duchess, who cannot\nfail to come to your aid?\"\n\n\"Well, you see, my dear d'Artagnan, with what ill luck I play,\" replied\nPorthos, with the most careless air in the world. \"I wrote to her\nto send me fifty louis or so, of which I stood absolutely in need on\naccount of my accident.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, she must be at her country seat, for she has not answered me.\"\n\n\"Truly?\"\n\n\"No; so I yesterday addressed another epistle to her, still more\npressing than the first. But you are here, my dear fellow, let us speak\nof you. I confess I began to be very uneasy on your account.\"\n\n\"But your host behaves very well toward you, as it appears, my dear\nPorthos,\" said d'Artagnan, directing the sick man's attention to the\nfull stewpans and the empty bottles.\n\n\"So, so,\" replied Porthos. \"Only three or four days ago the impertinent\njackanapes gave me his bill, and I was forced to turn both him and his\nbill out of the door; so that I am here something in the fashion of a\nconqueror, holding my position, as it were, my conquest. So you see,\nbeing in constant fear of being forced from that position, I am armed to\nthe teeth.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" said d'Artagnan, laughing, \"it appears to me that from time\nto time you must make SORTIES.\" And he again pointed to the bottles and\nthe stewpans.\n\n\"Not I, unfortunately!\" said Porthos. \"This miserable strain confines\nme to my bed; but Mousqueton forages, and brings in provisions. Friend\nMousqueton, you see that we have a reinforcement, and we must have an\nincrease of supplies.\"\n\n\"Mousqueton,\" said d'Artagnan, \"you must render me a service.\"\n\n\"What, monsieur?\"\n\n\"You must give your recipe to Planchet. I may be besieged in my turn,\nand I shall not be sorry for him to be able to let me enjoy the same\nadvantages with which you gratify your master.\"\n\n\"Lord, monsieur! There is nothing more easy,\" said Mousqueton, with a\nmodest air. \"One only needs to be sharp, that's all. I was brought up\nin the country, and my father in his leisure time was something of a\npoacher.\"\n\n\"And what did he do the rest of his time?\"\n\n\"Monsieur, he carried on a trade which I have always thought\nsatisfactory.\"\n\n\"Which?\"\n\n\"As it was a time of war between the Catholics and the Huguenots, and\nas he saw the Catholics exterminate the Huguenots and the Huguenots\nexterminate the Catholics--all in the name of religion--he adopted a\nmixed belief which permitted him to be sometimes Catholic, sometimes a\nHuguenot. Now, he was accustomed to walk with his fowling piece on his\nshoulder, behind the hedges which border the roads, and when he saw a\nCatholic coming alone, the Protestant religion immediately prevailed\nin his mind. He lowered his gun in the direction of the traveler; then,\nwhen he was within ten paces of him, he commenced a conversation which\nalmost always ended by the traveler's abandoning his purse to save his\nlife. It goes without saying that when he saw a Huguenot coming, he\nfelt himself filled with such ardent Catholic zeal that he could not\nunderstand how, a quarter of an hour before, he had been able to have\nany doubts upon the superiority of our holy religion. For my part,\nmonsieur, I am Catholic--my father, faithful to his principles, having\nmade my elder brother a Huguenot.\"\n\n\"And what was the end of this worthy man?\" asked d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Oh, of the most unfortunate kind, monsieur. One day he was surprised\nin a lonely road between a Huguenot and a Catholic, with both of whom\nhe had before had business, and who both knew him again; so they united\nagainst him and hanged him on a tree. Then they came and boasted of\ntheir fine exploit in the cabaret of the next village, where my brother\nand I were drinking.\"\n\n\"And what did you do?\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"We let them tell their story out,\" replied Mousqueton. \"Then, as in\nleaving the cabaret they took different directions, my brother went and\nhid himself on the road of the Catholic, and I on that of the Huguenot.\nTwo hours after, all was over; we had done the business of both,\nadmiring the foresight of our poor father, who had taken the precaution\nto bring each of us up in a different religion.\"\n\n\"Well, I must allow, as you say, your father was a very intelligent\nfellow. And you say in his leisure moments the worthy man was a\npoacher?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, and it was he who taught me to lay a snare and ground a\nline. The consequence is that when I saw our laborers, which did not at\nall suit two such delicate stomachs as ours, I had recourse to a little\nof my old trade. While walking near the wood of Monsieur le Prince, I\nlaid a few snare in the runs; and while reclining on the banks of his\nHighness's pieces of water, I slipped a few lines into his fish ponds.\nSo that now, thanks be to God, we do not want, as Monsieur can testify,\nfor partridges, rabbits, carp or eels--all light, wholesome food,\nsuitable for the sick.\"\n\n\"But the wine,\" said d'Artagnan, \"who furnishes the wine? Your host?\"\n\n\"That is to say, yes and no.\"\n\n\"How yes and no?\"\n\n\"He furnishes it, it is true, but he does not know that he has that\nhonor.\"\n\n\"Explain yourself, Mousqueton; your conversation is full of instructive\nthings.\"\n\n\"That is it, monsieur. It has so chanced that I met with a Spaniard in\nmy peregrinations who had seen many countries, and among them the New\nWorld.\"\n\n\"What connection can the New World have with the bottles which are on\nthe commode and the wardrobe?\"\n\n\"Patience, monsieur, everything will come in its turn.\"\n\n\"This Spaniard had in his service a lackey who had accompanied him in\nhis voyage to Mexico. This lackey was my compatriot; and we became the\nmore intimate from there being many resemblances of character between\nus. We loved sporting of all kinds better than anything; so that he\nrelated to me how in the plains of the Pampas the natives hunt the\ntiger and the wild bull with simple running nooses which they throw to\na distance of twenty or thirty paces the end of a cord with such nicety;\nbut in face of the proof I was obliged to acknowledge the truth of the\nrecital. My friend placed a bottle at the distance of thirty paces, and\nat each cast he caught the neck of the bottle in his running noose.\nI practiced this exercise, and as nature has endowed me with some\nfaculties, at this day I can throw the lasso with any man in the world.\nWell, do you understand, monsieur? Our host has a well-furnished cellar\nthe key of which never leaves him; only this cellar has a ventilating\nhole. Now through this ventilating hole I throw my lasso, and as I now\nknow in which part of the cellar is the best wine, that's my point for\nsport. You see, monsieur, what the New World has to do with the bottles\nwhich are on the commode and the wardrobe. Now, will you taste our wine,\nand without prejudice say what you think of it?\"\n\n\"Thank you, my friend, thank you; unfortunately, I have just\nbreakfasted.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Porthos, \"arrange the table, Mousqueton, and while we\nbreakfast, d'Artagnan will relate to us what has happened to him during\nthe ten days since he left us.\"\n\n\"Willingly,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\nWhile Porthos and Mousqueton were breakfasting, with the appetites of\nconvalescents and with that brotherly cordiality which unites men in\nmisfortune, d'Artagnan related how Aramis, being wounded, was obliged to\nstop at Crevecoeur, how he had left Athos fighting at Amiens with four\nmen who accused him of being a coiner, and how he, d'Artagnan, had been\nforced to run the Comtes de Wardes through the body in order to reach\nEngland.\n\nBut there the confidence of d'Artagnan stopped. He only added that\non his return from Great Britain he had brought back four magnificent\nhorses--one for himself, and one for each of his companions; then he\ninformed Porthos that the one intended for him was already installed in\nthe stable of the tavern.\n\nAt this moment Planchet entered, to inform his master that the horses\nwere sufficiently refreshed and that it would be possible to sleep at\nClermont.\n\nAs d'Artagnan was tolerably reassured with regard to Porthos, and as\nhe was anxious to obtain news of his two other friends, he held out his\nhand to the wounded man, and told him he was about to resume his route\nin order to continue his researches. For the rest, as he reckoned upon\nreturning by the same route in seven or eight days, if Porthos were\nstill at the Great St. Martin, he would call for him on his way.\n\nPorthos replied that in all probability his sprain would not permit\nhim to depart yet awhile. Besides, it was necessary he should stay at\nChantilly to wait for the answer from his duchess.\n\nD'Artagnan wished that answer might be prompt and favorable; and having\nagain recommended Porthos to the care of Mousqueton, and paid his bill\nto the host, he resumed his route with Planchet, already relieved of one\nof his led horses.\n\n\n\n\n26 ARAMIS AND HIS THESIS\n\nD'Artagnan had said nothing to Porthos of his wound or of his\nprocurator's wife. Our Bearnais was a prudent lad, however young\nhe might be. Consequently he had appeared to believe all that the\nvainglorious Musketeer had told him, convinced that no friendship will\nhold out against a surprised secret. Besides, we feel always a sort\nof mental superiority over those whose lives we know better than they\nsuppose. In his projects of intrigue for the future, and determined\nas he was to make his three friends the instruments of his fortune,\nd'Artagnan was not sorry at getting into his grasp beforehand the\ninvisible strings by which he reckoned upon moving them.\n\nAnd yet, as he journeyed along, a profound sadness weighed upon his\nheart. He thought of that young and pretty Mme. Bonacieux who was to\nhave paid him the price of his devotedness; but let us hasten to say\nthat this sadness possessed the young man less from the regret of the\nhappiness he had missed, than from the fear he entertained that some\nserious misfortune had befallen the poor woman. For himself, he had no\ndoubt she was a victim of the cardinal's vengeance; and, and as was\nwell known, the vengeance of his Eminence was terrible. How he had found\ngrace in the eyes of the minister, he did not know; but without doubt M.\nde Cavois would have revealed this to him if the captain of the Guards\nhad found him at home.\n\nNothing makes time pass more quickly or more shortens a journey than a\nthought which absorbs in itself all the faculties of the organization of\nhim who thinks. External existence then resembles a sleep of which this\nthought is the dream. By its influence, time has no longer measure,\nspace has no longer distance. We depart from one place, and arrive at\nanother, that is all. Of the interval passed, nothing remains in the\nmemory but a vague mist in which a thousand confused images of\ntrees, mountains, and landscapes are lost. It was as a prey to this\nhallucination that d'Artagnan traveled, at whatever pace his horse\npleased, the six or eight leagues that separated Chantilly from\nCrevecoeur, without his being able to remember on his arrival in the\nvillage any of the things he had passed or met with on the road.\n\nThere only his memory returned to him. He shook his head, perceived the\ncabaret at which he had left Aramis, and putting his horse to the trot,\nhe shortly pulled up at the door.\n\nThis time it was not a host but a hostess who received him. d'Artagnan\nwas a physiognomist. His eye took in at a glance the plump, cheerful\ncountenance of the mistress of the place, and he at once perceived there\nwas no occasion for dissembling with her, or of fearing anything from\none blessed with such a joyous physiognomy.\n\n\"My good dame,\" asked d'Artagnan, \"can you tell me what has become of\none of my friends, whom we were obliged to leave here about a dozen days\nago?\"\n\n\"A handsome young man, three- or four-and-twenty years old, mild,\namiable, and well made?\"\n\n\"That is he--wounded in the shoulder.\"\n\n\"Just so. Well, monsieur, he is still here.\"\n\n\"Ah, PARDIEU! My dear dame,\" said d'Artagnan, springing from his horse,\nand throwing the bridle to Planchet, \"you restore me to life; where is\nthis dear Aramis? Let me embrace him, I am in a hurry to see him again.\"\n\n\"Pardon, monsieur, but I doubt whether he can see you at this moment.\"\n\n\"Why so? Has he a lady with him?\"\n\n\"Jesus! What do you mean by that? Poor lad! No, monsieur, he has not a\nlady with him.\"\n\n\"With whom is he, then?\"\n\n\"With the curate of Montdidier and the superior of the Jesuits of\nAmiens.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" cried d'Artagnan, \"is the poor fellow worse, then?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur, quite the contrary; but after his illness grace touched\nhim, and he determined to take orders.\"\n\n\"That's it!\" said d'Artagnan, \"I had forgotten that he was only a\nMusketeer for a time.\"\n\n\"Monsieur still insists upon seeing him?\"\n\n\"More than ever.\"\n\n\"Well, monsieur has only to take the right-hand staircase in the\ncourtyard, and knock at Number Five on the second floor.\"\n\nD'Artagnan walked quickly in the direction indicated, and found one of\nthose exterior staircases that are still to be seen in the yards of our\nold-fashioned taverns. But there was no getting at the place of sojourn\nof the future abbe; the defiles of the chamber of Aramis were as well\nguarded as the gardens of Armida. Bazin was stationed in the corridor,\nand barred his passage with the more intrepidity that, after many years\nof trial, Bazin found himself near a result of which he had ever been\nambitious.\n\nIn fact, the dream of poor Bazin had always been to serve a churchman;\nand he awaited with impatience the moment, always in the future,\nwhen Aramis would throw aside the uniform and assume the cassock. The\ndaily-renewed promise of the young man that the moment would not long be\ndelayed, had alone kept him in the service of a Musketeer--a service in\nwhich, he said, his soul was in constant jeopardy.\n\nBazin was then at the height of joy. In all probability, this time\nhis master would not retract. The union of physical pain with moral\nuneasiness had produced the effect so long desired. Aramis, suffering\nat once in body and mind, had at length fixed his eyes and his thoughts\nupon religion, and he had considered as a warning from heaven the\ndouble accident which had happened to him; that is to say, the sudden\ndisappearance of his mistress and the wound in his shoulder.\n\nIt may be easily understood that in the present disposition of his\nmaster nothing could be more disagreeable to Bazin than the arrival of\nd'Artagnan, which might cast his master back again into that vortex of\nmundane affairs which had so long carried him away. He resolved, then,\nto defend the door bravely; and as, betrayed by the mistress of the inn,\nhe could not say that Aramis was absent, he endeavored to prove to the\nnewcomer that it would be the height of indiscretion to disturb his\nmaster in his pious conference, which had commenced with the morning and\nwould not, as Bazin said, terminate before night.\n\nBut d'Artagnan took very little heed of the eloquent discourse of M.\nBazin; and as he had no desire to support a polemic discussion with his\nfriend's valet, he simply moved him out of the way with one hand, and\nwith the other turned the handle of the door of Number Five. The door\nopened, and d'Artagnan went into the chamber.\n\nAramis, in a black gown, his head enveloped in a sort of round flat cap,\nnot much unlike a CALOTTE, was seated before an oblong table, covered\nwith rolls of paper and enormous volumes in folio. At his right hand\nwas placed the superior of the Jesuits, and on his left the curate\nof Montdidier. The curtains were half drawn, and only admitted the\nmysterious light calculated for beatific reveries. All the mundane\nobjects that generally strike the eye on entering the room of a young\nman, particularly when that young man is a Musketeer, had disappeared as\nif by enchantment; and for fear, no doubt, that the sight of them might\nbring his master back to ideas of this world, Bazin had laid his hands\nupon sword, pistols, plumed hat, and embroideries and laces of all kinds\nand sorts. In their stead d'Artagnan thought he perceived in an obscure\ncorner a discipline cord suspended from a nail in the wall.\n\nAt the noise made by d'Artagnan in entering, Aramis lifted up his head,\nand beheld his friend; but to the great astonishment of the young man,\nthe sight of him did not produce much effect upon the Musketeer, so\ncompletely was his mind detached from the things of this world.\n\n\"Good day, dear d'Artagnan,\" said Aramis; \"believe me, I am glad to see\nyou.\"\n\n\"So am I delighted to see you,\" said d'Artagnan, \"although I am not yet\nsure that it is Aramis I am speaking to.\"\n\n\"To himself, my friend, to himself! But what makes you doubt it?\"\n\n\"I was afraid I had made a mistake in the chamber, and that I had found\nmy way into the apartment of some churchman. Then another error seized\nme on seeing you in company with these gentlemen--I was afraid you were\ndangerously ill.\"\n\nThe two men in black, who guessed d'Artagnan's meaning, darted at him a\nglance which might have been thought threatening; but d'Artagnan took no\nheed of it.\n\n\"I disturb you, perhaps, my dear Aramis,\" continued d'Artagnan, \"for\nby what I see, I am led to believe that you are confessing to these\ngentlemen.\"\n\nAramis colored imperceptibly. \"You disturb me? Oh, quite the contrary,\ndear friend, I swear; and as a proof of what I say, permit me to declare\nI am rejoiced to see you safe and sound.\"\n\n\"Ah, he'll come round,\" thought d'Artagnan; \"that's not bad!\"\n\n\"This gentleman, who is my friend, has just escaped from a serious\ndanger,\" continued Aramis, with unction, pointing to d'Artagnan with his\nhand, and addressing the two ecclesiastics.\n\n\"Praise God, monsieur,\" replied they, bowing together.\n\n\"I have not failed to do so, your Reverences,\" replied the young man,\nreturning their salutation.\n\n\"You arrive in good time, dear d'Artagnan,\" said Aramis, \"and by taking\npart in our discussion may assist us with your intelligence. Monsieur\nthe Principal of Amiens, Monsieur the Curate of Montdidier, and I\nare arguing certain theological questions in which we have been much\ninterested; I shall be delighted to have your opinion.\"\n\n\"The opinion of a swordsman can have very little weight,\" replied\nd'Artagnan, who began to be uneasy at the turn things were taking, \"and\nyou had better be satisfied, believe me, with the knowledge of these\ngentlemen.\"\n\nThe two men in black bowed in their turn.\n\n\"On the contrary,\" replied Aramis, \"your opinion will be very valuable.\nThe question is this: Monsieur the Principal thinks that my thesis ought\nto be dogmatic and didactic.\"\n\n\"Your thesis! Are you then making a thesis?\"\n\n\"Without doubt,\" replied the Jesuit. \"In the examination which precedes\nordination, a thesis is always a requisite.\"\n\n\"Ordination!\" cried d'Artagnan, who could not believe what the hostess\nand Bazin had successively told him; and he gazed, half stupefied, upon\nthe three persons before him.\n\n\"Now,\" continued Aramis, taking the same graceful position in his easy\nchair that he would have assumed in bed, and complacently examining his\nhand, which was as white and plump as that of a woman, and which he\nheld in the air to cause the blood to descend, \"now, as you have heard,\nd'Artagnan, Monsieur the Principal is desirous that my thesis should be\ndogmatic, while I, for my part, would rather it should be ideal. This is\nthe reason why Monsieur the Principal has proposed to me the following\nsubject, which has not yet been treated upon, and in which I perceive\nthere is matter for magnificent elaboration-'UTRAQUE MANUS IN\nBENEDICENDO CLERICIS INFERIORIBUS NECESSARIA EST.'\"\n\nD'Artagnan, whose erudition we are well acquainted with, evinced no more\ninterest on hearing this quotation than he had at that of M. de Treville\nin allusion to the gifts he pretended that d'Artagnan had received from\nthe Duke of Buckingham.\n\n\"Which means,\" resumed Aramis, that he might perfectly understand, \"'The\ntwo hands are indispensable for priests of the inferior orders, when\nthey bestow the benediction.'\"\n\n\"An admirable subject!\" cried the Jesuit.\n\n\"Admirable and dogmatic!\" repeated the curate, who, about as strong as\nd'Artagnan with respect to Latin, carefully watched the Jesuit in order\nto keep step with him, and repeated his words like an echo.\n\nAs to d'Artagnan, he remained perfectly insensible to the enthusiasm of\nthe two men in black.\n\n\"Yes, admirable! PRORSUS ADMIRABILE!\" continued Aramis; \"but which\nrequires a profound study of both the Scriptures and the Fathers. Now, I\nhave confessed to these learned ecclesiastics, and that in all humility,\nthat the duties of mounting guard and the service of the king have\ncaused me to neglect study a little. I should find myself, therefore,\nmore at my ease, FACILUS NATANS, in a subject of my own choice,\nwhich would be to these hard theological questions what morals are to\nmetaphysics in philosophy.\"\n\nD'Artagnan began to be tired, and so did the curate.\n\n\"See what an exordium!\" cried the Jesuit.\n\n\"Exordium,\" repeated the curate, for the sake of saying something.\n\"QUEMADMODUM INTER COELORUM IMMENSITATEM.\"\n\nAramis cast a glance upon d'Artagnan to see what effect all this\nproduced, and found his friend gaping enough to split his jaws.\n\n\"Let us speak French, my father,\" said he to the Jesuit; \"Monsieur\nd'Artagnan will enjoy our conversation better.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied d'Artagnan; \"I am fatigued with reading, and all this\nLatin confuses me.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied the Jesuit, a little put out, while the curate,\ngreatly delighted, turned upon d'Artagnan a look full of gratitude.\n\"Well, let us see what is to be derived from this gloss. Moses, the\nservant of God-he was but a servant, please to understand-Moses blessed\nwith the hands; he held out both his arms while the Hebrews beat their\nenemies, and then he blessed them with his two hands. Besides, what does\nthe Gospel say? IMPONITE MANUS, and not MANUM-place the HANDS, not the\nHAND.\"\n\n\"Place the HANDS,\" repeated the curate, with a gesture.\n\n\"St. Peter, on the contrary, of whom the Popes are the successors,\"\ncontinued the Jesuit; \"PORRIGE DIGITOS-present the fingers. Are you\nthere, now?\"\n\n\"CERTES,\" replied Aramis, in a pleased tone, \"but the thing is subtle.\"\n\n\"The FINGERS,\" resumed the Jesuit, \"St. Peter blessed with the FINGERS.\nThe Pope, therefore blesses with the fingers. And with how many fingers\ndoes he bless? With THREE fingers, to be sure-one for the Father, one\nfor the Son, and one for the Holy Ghost.\"\n\nAll crossed themselves. D'Artagnan thought it was proper to follow this\nexample.\n\n\"The Pope is the successor of St. Peter, and represents the three divine\npowers; the rest-ORDINES INFERIORES-of the ecclesiastical hierarchy\nbless in the name of the holy archangels and angels. The most humble\nclerks such as our deacons and sacristans, bless with holy water\nsprinklers, which resemble an infinite number of blessing fingers. There\nis the subject simplified. ARGUMENTUM OMNI DENUDATUM ORNAMENTO. I\ncould make of that subject two volumes the size of this,\" continued the\nJesuit; and in his enthusiasm he struck a St. Chrysostom in folio, which\nmade the table bend beneath its weight.\n\nD'Artagnan trembled.\n\n\"CERTES,\" said Aramis, \"I do justice to the beauties of this thesis;\nbut at the same time I perceive it would be overwhelming for me. I\nhad chosen this text-tell me, dear d'Artagnan, if it is not to your\ntaste-'NON INUTILE EST DESIDERIUM IN OBLATIONE'; that is, 'A little\nregret is not unsuitable in an offering to the Lord.'\"\n\n\"Stop there!\" cried the Jesuit, \"for that thesis touches closely upon\nheresy. There is a proposition almost like it in the AUGUSTINUS of the\nheresiarch Jansenius, whose book will sooner or later be burned by the\nhands of the executioner. Take care, my young friend. You are inclining\ntoward false doctrines, my young friend; you will be lost.\"\n\n\"You will be lost,\" said the curate, shaking his head sorrowfully.\n\n\"You approach that famous point of free will which is a mortal rock. You\nface the insinuations of the Pelagians and the semi-Pelagians.\"\n\n\"But, my Reverend-\" replied Aramis, a little amazed by the shower of\narguments that poured upon his head.\n\n\"How will you prove,\" continued the Jesuit, without allowing him time\nto speak, \"that we ought to regret the world when we offer ourselves to\nGod? Listen to this dilemma: God is God, and the world is the devil. To\nregret the world is to regret the devil; that is my conclusion.\"\n\n\"And that is mine also,\" said the curate.\n\n\"But, for heaven's sake-\" resumed Aramis.\n\n\"DESIDERAS DIABOLUM, unhappy man!\" cried the Jesuit.\n\n\"He regrets the devil! Ah, my young friend,\" added the curate, groaning,\n\"do not regret the devil, I implore you!\"\n\nD'Artagnan felt himself bewildered. It seemed to him as though he were\nin a madhouse, and was becoming as mad as those he saw. He was, however,\nforced to hold his tongue from not comprehending half the language they\nemployed.\n\n\"But listen to me, then,\" resumed Aramis with politeness mingled with\na little impatience. \"I do not say I regret; no, I will never pronounce\nthat sentence, which would not be orthodox.\"\n\nThe Jesuit raised his hands toward heaven, and the curate did the same.\n\n\"No; but pray grant me that it is acting with an ill grace to offer\nto the Lord only that with which we are perfectly disgusted! Don't you\nthink so, d'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"I think so, indeed,\" cried he.\n\nThe Jesuit and the curate quite started from their chairs.\n\n\"This is the point of departure; it is a syllogism. The world is not\nwanting in attractions. I quit the world; then I make a sacrifice. Now,\nthe Scripture says positively, 'Make a sacrifice unto the Lord.'\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said his antagonists.\n\n\"And then,\" said Aramis, pinching his ear to make it red, as he rubbed\nhis hands to make them white, \"and then I made a certain RONDEAU upon it\nlast year, which I showed to Monsieur Voiture, and that great man paid\nme a thousand compliments.\"\n\n\"A RONDEAU!\" said the Jesuit, disdainfully.\n\n\"A RONDEAU!\" said the curate, mechanically.\n\n\"Repeat it! Repeat it!\" cried d'Artagnan; \"it will make a little\nchange.\"\n\n\"Not so, for it is religious,\" replied Aramis; \"it is theology in\nverse.\"\n\n\"The devil!\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Here it is,\" said Aramis, with a little look of diffidence, which,\nhowever, was not exempt from a shade of hypocrisy:\n\n\n\"Vous qui pleurez un passe plein de charmes, Et qui trainez des jours\ninfortunes, Tous vos malheurs se verront termines, Quand a Dieu seul\nvous offrirez vos larmes, Vous qui pleurez!\"\n\n\"You who weep for pleasures fled, While dragging on a life of care,\nAll your woes will melt in air, If to God your tears are shed, You who\nweep!\"\n\n\nd'Artagnan and the curate appeared pleased. The Jesuit persisted in his\nopinion. \"Beware of a profane taste in your theological style. What says\nAugustine on this subject: 'SEVERUS SIT CLERICORUM VERBO.'\"\n\n\"Yes, let the sermon be clear,\" said the curate.\n\n\"Now,\" hastily interrupted the Jesuit, on seeing that his acolyte was\ngoing astray, \"now your thesis would please the ladies; it would have\nthe success of one of Monsieur Patru's pleadings.\"\n\n\"Please God!\" cried Aramis, transported.\n\n\"There it is,\" cried the Jesuit; \"the world still speaks within you in a\nloud voice, ALTISIMMA VOCE. You follow the world, my young friend, and I\ntremble lest grace prove not efficacious.\"\n\n\"Be satisfied, my reverend father, I can answer for myself.\"\n\n\"Mundane presumption!\"\n\n\"I know myself, Father; my resolution is irrevocable.\"\n\n\"Then you persist in continuing that thesis?\"\n\n\"I feel myself called upon to treat that, and no other. I will see about\nthe continuation of it, and tomorrow I hope you will be satisfied with\nthe corrections I shall have made in consequence of your advice.\"\n\n\"Work slowly,\" said the curate; \"we leave you in an excellent tone of\nmind.\"\n\n\"Yes, the ground is all sown,\" said the Jesuit, \"and we have not to fear\nthat one portion of the seed may have fallen upon stone, another upon\nthe highway, or that the birds of heaven have eaten the rest, AVES COELI\nCOMEDERUNT ILLAM.\"\n\n\"Plague stifle you and your Latin!\" said d'Artagnan, who began to feel\nall his patience exhausted.\n\n\"Farewell, my son,\" said the curate, \"till tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Till tomorrow, rash youth,\" said the Jesuit. \"You promise to become one\nof the lights of the Church. Heaven grant that this light prove not a\ndevouring fire!\"\n\nD'Artagnan, who for an hour past had been gnawing his nails with\nimpatience, was beginning to attack the quick.\n\nThe two men in black rose, bowed to Aramis and d'Artagnan, and advanced\ntoward the door. Bazin, who had been standing listening to all this\ncontroversy with a pious jubilation, sprang toward them, took the\nbreviary of the curate and the missal of the Jesuit, and walked\nrespectfully before them to clear their way.\n\nAramis conducted them to the foot of the stairs, and then immediately\ncame up again to d'Artagnan, whose senses were still in a state of\nconfusion.\n\nWhen left alone, the two friends at first kept an embarrassed silence.\nIt however became necessary for one of them to break it first, and as\nd'Artagnan appeared determined to leave that honor to his companion,\nAramis said, \"you see that I am returned to my fundamental ideas.\"\n\n\"Yes, efficacious grace has touched you, as that gentleman said just\nnow.\"\n\n\"Oh, these plans of retreat have been formed for a long time. You have\noften heard me speak of them, have you not, my friend?\"\n\n\"Yes; but I confess I always thought you jested.\"\n\n\"With such things! Oh, d'Artagnan!\"\n\n\"The devil! Why, people jest with death.\"\n\n\"And people are wrong, d'Artagnan; for death is the door which leads to\nperdition or to salvation.\"\n\n\"Granted; but if you please, let us not theologize, Aramis. You must\nhave had enough for today. As for me, I have almost forgotten the little\nLatin I have ever known. Then I confess to you that I have eaten nothing\nsince ten o'clock this morning, and I am devilish hungry.\"\n\n\"We will dine directly, my friend; only you must please to remember that\nthis is Friday. Now, on such a day I can neither eat flesh nor see it\neaten. If you can be satisfied with my dinner-it consists of cooked\ntetragones and fruits.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by tetragones?\" asked d'Artagnan, uneasily.\n\n\"I mean spinach,\" replied Aramis; \"but on your account I will add some\neggs, and that is a serious infraction of the rule-for eggs are meat,\nsince they engender chickens.\"\n\n\"This feast is not very succulent; but never mind, I will put up with it\nfor the sake of remaining with you.\"\n\n\"I am grateful to you for the sacrifice,\" said Aramis; \"but if your body\nbe not greatly benefited by it, be assured your soul will.\"\n\n\"And so, Aramis, you are decidedly going into the Church? What will our\ntwo friends say? What will Monsieur de Treville say? They will treat you\nas a deserter, I warn you.\"\n\n\"I do not enter the Church; I re-enter it. I deserted the Church for the\nworld, for you know that I forced myself when I became a Musketeer.\"\n\n\"I? I know nothing about it.\"\n\n\"You don't know I quit the seminary?\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"This is my story, then. Besides, the Scriptures say, 'Confess\nyourselves to one another,' and I confess to you, d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"And I give you absolution beforehand. You see I am a good sort of a\nman.\"\n\n\"Do not jest about holy things, my friend.\"\n\n\"Go on, then, I listen.\"\n\n\"I had been at the seminary from nine years old; in three days I should\nhave been twenty. I was about to become an abbe, and all was arranged.\nOne evening I went, according to custom, to a house which I frequented\nwith much pleasure: when one is young, what can be expected?--one is\nweak. An officer who saw me, with a jealous eye, reading the LIVES OF\nTHE SAINTS to the mistress of the house, entered suddenly and without\nbeing announced. That evening I had translated an episode of Judith, and\nhad just communicated my verses to the lady, who gave me all sorts of\ncompliments, and leaning on my shoulder, was reading them a second time\nwith me. Her pose, which I must admit was rather free, wounded this\nofficer. He said nothing; but when I went out he followed, and quickly\ncame up with me. 'Monsieur the Abbe,' said he, 'do you like blows with\na cane?' 'I cannot say, monsieur,' answered I; 'no one has ever dared\nto give me any.' 'Well, listen to me, then, Monsieur the Abbe! If you\nventure again into the house in which I have met you this evening, I\nwill dare it myself.' I really think I must have been frightened. I\nbecame very pale; I felt my legs fail me; I sought for a reply, but\ncould find none-I was silent. The officer waited for his reply, and\nseeing it so long coming, he burst into a laugh, turned upon his heel,\nand re-entered the house. I returned to the seminary.\n\n\"I am a gentleman born, and my blood is warm, as you may have remarked,\nmy dear d'Artagnan. The insult was terrible, and although unknown to the\nrest of the world, I felt it live and fester at the bottom of my heart.\nI informed my superiors that I did not feel myself sufficiently prepared\nfor ordination, and at my request the ceremony was postponed for a year.\nI sought out the best fencing master in Paris, I made an agreement with\nhim to take a lesson every day, and every day for a year I took\nthat lesson. Then, on the anniversary of the day on which I had been\ninsulted, I hung my cassock on a peg, assumed the costume of a cavalier,\nand went to a ball given by a lady friend of mine and to which I knew\nmy man was invited. It was in the Rue des France-Bourgeois, close to La\nForce. As I expected, my officer was there. I went up to him as he was\nsinging a love ditty and looking tenderly at a lady, and interrupted him\nexactly in the middle of the second couplet. 'Monsieur,' said I, 'does\nit still displease you that I should frequent a certain house of La\nRue Payenne? And would you still cane me if I took it into my head to\ndisobey you? The officer looked at me with astonishment, and then said,\n'What is your business with me, monsieur? I do not know you.' 'I am,'\nsaid I, 'the little abbe who reads LIVES OF THE SAINTS, and translates\nJudith into verse.' 'Ah, ah! I recollect now,' said the officer, in a\njeering tone; 'well, what do you want with me?' 'I want you to spare\ntime to take a walk with me.' 'Tomorrow morning, if you like, with\nthe greatest pleasure.' 'No, not tomorrow morning, if you please, but\nimmediately.' 'If you absolutely insist.' 'I do insist upon it.' 'Come,\nthen. Ladies,' said the officer, 'do not disturb yourselves; allow me\ntime just to kill this gentleman, and I will return and finish the last\ncouplet.'\n\n\"We went out. I took him to the Rue Payenne, to exactly the same\nspot where, a year before, at the very same hour, he had paid me the\ncompliment I have related to you. It was a superb moonlight night. We\nimmediately drew, and at the first pass I laid him stark dead.\"\n\n\"The devil!\" cried d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Now,\" continued Aramis, \"as the ladies did not see the singer come\nback, and as he was found in the Rue Payenne with a great sword wound\nthrough his body, it was supposed that I had accommodated him thus; and\nthe matter created some scandal which obliged me to renounce the cassock\nfor a time. Athos, whose acquaintance I made about that period, and\nPorthos, who had in addition to my lessons taught me some effective\ntricks of fence, prevailed upon me to solicit the uniform of a\nMusketeer. The king entertained great regard for my father, who had\nfallen at the siege of Arras, and the uniform was granted. You may\nunderstand that the moment has come for me to re-enter the bosom of the\nChurch.\"\n\n\"And why today, rather than yesterday or tomorrow? What has happened to\nyou today, to raise all these melancholy ideas?\"\n\n\"This wound, my dear d'Artagnan, has been a warning to me from heaven.\"\n\n\"This wound? Bah, it is now nearly healed, and I am sure it is not that\nwhich gives you the most pain.\"\n\n\"What, then?\" said Aramis, blushing.\n\n\"You have one at heart, Aramis, one deeper and more painful--a wound\nmade by a woman.\"\n\nThe eye of Aramis kindled in spite of himself.\n\n\"Ah,\" said he, dissembling his emotion under a feigned carelessness,\n\"do not talk of such things, and suffer love pains? VANITAS VANITATUM!\nAccording to your idea, then, my brain is turned. And for whom-for some\nGRISETTE, some chambermaid with whom I have trifled in some garrison?\nFie!\"\n\n\"Pardon, my dear Aramis, but I thought you carried your eyes higher.\"\n\n\"Higher? And who am I, to nourish such ambition? A poor Musketeer, a\nbeggar, an unknown-who hates slavery, and finds himself ill-placed in\nthe world.\"\n\n\"Aramis, Aramis!\" cried d'Artagnan, looking at his friend with an air of\ndoubt.\n\n\"Dust I am, and to dust I return. Life is full of humiliations and\nsorrows,\" continued he, becoming still more melancholy; \"all the ties\nwhich attach him to life break in the hand of man, particularly the\ngolden ties. Oh, my dear d'Artagnan,\" resumed Aramis, giving to his\nvoice a slight tone of bitterness, \"trust me! Conceal your wounds when\nyou have any; silence is the last joy of the unhappy. Beware of giving\nanyone the clue to your griefs; the curious suck our tears as flies suck\nthe blood of a wounded hart.\"\n\n\"Alas, my dear Aramis,\" said d'Artagnan, in his turn heaving a profound\nsigh, \"that is my story you are relating!\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Yes; a woman whom I love, whom I adore, has just been torn from me by\nforce. I do not know where she is or whither they have conducted her.\nShe is perhaps a prisoner; she is perhaps dead!\"\n\n\"Yes, but you have at least this consolation, that you can say to\nyourself she has not quit you voluntarily, that if you learn no news of\nher, it is because all communication with you is interdicted; while I--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" replied Aramis, \"nothing.\"\n\n\"So you renounce the world, then, forever; that is a settled thing--a\nresolution registered!\"\n\n\"Forever! You are my friend today; tomorrow you will be no more to me\nthan a shadow, or rather, even, you will no longer exist. As for the\nworld, it is a sepulcher and nothing else.\"\n\n\"The devil! All this is very sad which you tell me.\"\n\n\"What will you? My vocation commands me; it carries me away.\"\n\nD'Artagnan smiled, but made no answer.\n\nAramis continued, \"And yet, while I do belong to the earth, I wish to\nspeak of you--of our friends.\"\n\n\"And on my part,\" said d'Artagnan, \"I wished to speak of you, but I\nfind you so completely detached from everything! To love you cry, 'Fie!\nFriends are shadows! The world is a sepulcher!'\"\n\n\"Alas, you will find it so yourself,\" said Aramis, with a sigh.\n\n\"Well, then, let us say no more about it,\" said d'Artagnan; \"and let\nus burn this letter, which, no doubt, announces to you some fresh\ninfidelity of your GRISETTE or your chambermaid.\"\n\n\"What letter?\" cried Aramis, eagerly.\n\n\"A letter which was sent to your abode in your absence, and which was\ngiven to me for you.\"\n\n\"But from whom is that letter?\"\n\n\"Oh, from some heartbroken waiting woman, some desponding GRISETTE; from\nMadame de Chevreuse's chambermaid, perhaps, who was obliged to return\nto Tours with her mistress, and who, in order to appear smart and\nattractive, stole some perfumed paper, and sealed her letter with a\nduchess's coronet.\"\n\n\"What do you say?\"\n\n\"Hold! I must have lost it,\" said the young man maliciously, pretending\nto search for it. \"But fortunately the world is a sepulcher; the men,\nand consequently the women, are but shadows, and love is a sentiment to\nwhich you cry, 'Fie! Fie!'\"\n\n\"d'Artagnan, d'Artagnan,\" cried Aramis, \"you are killing me!\"\n\n\"Well, here it is at last!\" said d'Artagnan, as he drew the letter from\nhis pocket.\n\nAramis made a bound, seized the letter, read it, or rather devoured it,\nhis countenance radiant.\n\n\"This same waiting maid seems to have an agreeable style,\" said the\nmessenger, carelessly.\n\n\"Thanks, d'Artagnan, thanks!\" cried Aramis, almost in a state of\ndelirium. \"She was forced to return to Tours; she is not faithless; she\nstill loves me! Come, my friend, come, let me embrace you. Happiness\nalmost stifles me!\"\n\nThe two friends began to dance around the venerable St. Chrysostom,\nkicking about famously the sheets of the thesis, which had fallen on the\nfloor.\n\nAt that moment Bazin entered with the spinach and the omelet.\n\n\"Be off, you wretch!\" cried Aramis, throwing his skullcap in his face.\n\"Return whence you came; take back those horrible vegetables, and that\npoor kickshaw! Order a larded hare, a fat capon, mutton leg dressed with\ngarlic, and four bottles of old Burgundy.\"\n\nBazin, who looked at his master, without comprehending the cause of\nthis change, in a melancholy manner, allowed the omelet to slip into the\nspinach, and the spinach onto the floor.\n\n\"Now this is the moment to consecrate your existence to the King of\nkings,\" said d'Artagnan, \"if you persist in offering him a civility. NON\nINUTILE DESIDERIUM OBLATIONE.\"\n\n\"Go to the devil with your Latin. Let us drink, my dear d'Artagnan,\nMORBLEU! Let us drink while the wine is fresh! Let us drink heartily,\nand while we do so, tell me a little of what is going on in the world\nyonder.\"\n\n\n\n\n27 THE WIFE OF ATHOS\n\n\"We have now to search for Athos,\" said d'Artagnan to the vivacious\nAramis, when he had informed him of all that had passed since their\ndeparture from the capital, and an excellent dinner had made one of them\nforget his thesis and the other his fatigue.\n\n\"Do you think, then, that any harm can have happened to him?\"\nasked Aramis. \"Athos is so cool, so brave, and handles his sword so\nskillfully.\"\n\n\"No doubt. Nobody has a higher opinion of the courage and skill of Athos\nthan I have; but I like better to hear my sword clang against lances\nthan against staves. I fear lest Athos should have been beaten down by\nserving men. Those fellows strike hard, and don't leave off in a hurry.\nThis is why I wish to set out again as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"I will try to accompany you,\" said Aramis, \"though I scarcely feel in\na condition to mount on horseback. Yesterday I undertook to employ\nthat cord which you see hanging against the wall, but pain prevented my\ncontinuing the pious exercise.\"\n\n\"That's the first time I ever heard of anybody trying to cure gunshot\nwounds with cat-o'-nine-tails; but you were ill, and illness renders the\nhead weak, therefore you may be excused.\"\n\n\"When do you mean to set out?\"\n\n\"Tomorrow at daybreak. Sleep as soundly as you can tonight, and\ntomorrow, if you can, we will take our departure together.\"\n\n\"Till tomorrow, then,\" said Aramis; \"for iron-nerved as you are, you\nmust need repose.\"\n\nThe next morning, when d'Artagnan entered Aramis's chamber, he found him\nat the window.\n\n\"What are you looking at?\" asked d'Artagnan.\n\n\"My faith! I am admiring three magnificent horses which the stable boys\nare leading about. It would be a pleasure worthy of a prince to travel\nupon such horses.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear Aramis, you may enjoy that pleasure, for one of those\nthree horses is yours.\"\n\n\"Ah, bah! Which?\"\n\n\"Whichever of the three you like, I have no preference.\"\n\n\"And the rich caparison, is that mine, too?\"\n\n\"Without doubt.\"\n\n\"You laugh, d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"No, I have left off laughing, now that you speak French.\"\n\n\"What, those rich holsters, that velvet housing, that saddle studded\nwith silver-are they all for me?\"\n\n\"For you and nobody else, as the horse which paws the ground is mine,\nand the other horse, which is caracoling, belongs to Athos.\"\n\n\"PESTE! They are three superb animals!\"\n\n\"I am glad they please you.\"\n\n\"Why, it must have been the king who made you such a present.\"\n\n\"Certainly it was not the cardinal; but don't trouble yourself whence\nthey come, think only that one of the three is your property.\"\n\n\"I choose that which the red-headed boy is leading.\"\n\n\"It is yours!\"\n\n\"Good heaven! That is enough to drive away all my pains; I could mount\nhim with thirty balls in my body. On my soul, handsome stirrups! HOLA,\nBazin, come here this minute.\"\n\nBazin appeared on the threshold, dull and spiritless.\n\n\"That last order is useless,\" interrupted d'Artagnan; \"there are loaded\npistols in your holsters.\"\n\nBazin sighed.\n\n\"Come, Monsieur Bazin, make yourself easy,\" said d'Artagnan; \"people of\nall conditions gain the kingdom of heaven.\"\n\n\"Monsieur was already such a good theologian,\" said Bazin, almost\nweeping; \"he might have become a bishop, and perhaps a cardinal.\"\n\n\"Well, but my poor Bazin, reflect a little. Of what use is it to be a\nchurchman, pray? You do not avoid going to war by that means; you\nsee, the cardinal is about to make the next campaign, helm on head and\npartisan in hand. And Monsieur de Nogaret de la Valette, what do you say\nof him? He is a cardinal likewise. Ask his lackey how often he has had\nto prepare lint of him.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" sighed Bazin. \"I know it, monsieur; everything is turned\ntopsy-turvy in the world nowadays.\"\n\nWhile this dialogue was going on, the two young men and the poor lackey\ndescended.\n\n\"Hold my stirrup, Bazin,\" cried Aramis; and Aramis sprang into the\nsaddle with his usual grace and agility, but after a few vaults\nand curvets of the noble animal his rider felt his pains come on so\ninsupportably that he turned pale and became unsteady in his seat.\nD'Artagnan, who, foreseeing such an event, had kept his eye on him,\nsprang toward him, caught him in his arms, and assisted him to his\nchamber.\n\n\"That's all right, my dear Aramis, take care of yourself,\" said he; \"I\nwill go alone in search of Athos.\"\n\n\"You are a man of brass,\" replied Aramis.\n\n\"No, I have good luck, that is all. But how do you mean to pass your\ntime till I come back? No more theses, no more glosses upon the fingers\nor upon benedictions, hey?\"\n\nAramis smiled. \"I will make verses,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, I dare say; verses perfumed with the odor of the billet from the\nattendant of Madame de Chevreuse. Teach Bazin prosody; that will\nconsole him. As to the horse, ride him a little every day, and that will\naccustom you to his maneuvers.\"\n\n\"Oh, make yourself easy on that head,\" replied Aramis. \"You will find me\nready to follow you.\"\n\nThey took leave of each other, and in ten minutes, after having\ncommended his friend to the cares of the hostess and Bazin, d'Artagnan\nwas trotting along in the direction of Amiens.\n\nHow was he going to find Athos? Should he find him at all? The position\nin which he had left him was critical. He probably had succumbed. This\nidea, while darkening his brow, drew several sighs from him, and caused\nhim to formulate to himself a few vows of vengeance. Of all his friends,\nAthos was the eldest, and the least resembling him in appearance, in his\ntastes and sympathies.\n\nYet he entertained a marked preference for this gentleman. The noble and\ndistinguished air of Athos, those flashes of greatness which from time\nto time broke out from the shade in which he voluntarily kept himself,\nthat unalterable equality of temper which made him the most pleasant\ncompanion in the world, that forced and cynical gaiety, that bravery\nwhich might have been termed blind if it had not been the result of the\nrarest coolness--such qualities attracted more than the esteem, more\nthan the friendship of d'Artagnan; they attracted his admiration.\n\nIndeed, when placed beside M. de Treville, the elegant and noble\ncourtier, Athos in his most cheerful days might advantageously sustain\na comparison. He was of middle height; but his person was so admirably\nshaped and so well proportioned that more than once in his struggles\nwith Porthos he had overcome the giant whose physical strength was\nproverbial among the Musketeers. His head, with piercing eyes, a\nstraight nose, a chin cut like that of Brutus, had altogether an\nindefinable character of grandeur and grace. His hands, of which he took\nlittle care, were the despair of Aramis, who cultivated his with almond\npaste and perfumed oil. The sound of his voice was at once penetrating\nand melodious; and then, that which was inconceivable in Athos, who was\nalways retiring, was that delicate knowledge of the world and of the\nusages of the most brilliant society--those manners of a high degree\nwhich appeared, as if unconsciously to himself, in his least actions.\n\nIf a repast were on foot, Athos presided over it better than any other,\nplacing every guest exactly in the rank which his ancestors had earned\nfor him or that he had made for himself. If a question in heraldry\nwere started, Athos knew all the noble families of the kingdom, their\ngenealogy, their alliances, their coats of arms, and the origin of them.\nEtiquette had no minutiae unknown to him. He knew what were the rights\nof the great land owners. He was profoundly versed in hunting and\nfalconry, and had one day when conversing on this great art astonished\neven Louis XIII himself, who took a pride in being considered a past\nmaster therein.\n\nLike all the great nobles of that period, Athos rode and fenced\nto perfection. But still further, his education had been so little\nneglected, even with respect to scholastic studies, so rare at this\ntime among gentlemen, that he smiled at the scraps of Latin which Aramis\nsported and which Porthos pretended to understand. Two or three times,\neven, to the great astonishment of his friends, he had, when Aramis\nallowed some rudimental error to escape him, replaced a verb in\nits right tense and a noun in its case. Besides, his probity was\nirreproachable, in an age in which soldiers compromised so easily with\ntheir religion and their consciences, lovers with the rigorous delicacy\nof our era, and the poor with God's Seventh Commandment. This Athos,\nthen, was a very extraordinary man.\n\nAnd yet this nature so distinguished, this creature so beautiful, this\nessence so fine, was seen to turn insensibly toward material life, as\nold men turn toward physical and moral imbecility. Athos, in his hours\nof gloom--and these hours were frequent--was extinguished as to the\nwhole of the luminous portion of him, and his brilliant side disappeared\nas into profound darkness.\n\nThen the demigod vanished; he remained scarcely a man. His head hanging\ndown, his eye dull, his speech slow and painful, Athos would look for\nhours together at his bottle, his glass, or at Grimaud, who, accustomed\nto obey him by signs, read in the faint glance of his master his least\ndesire, and satisfied it immediately. If the four friends were assembled\nat one of these moments, a word, thrown forth occasionally with a\nviolent effort, was the share Athos furnished to the conversation.\nIn exchange for his silence Athos drank enough for four, and without\nappearing to be otherwise affected by wine than by a more marked\nconstriction of the brow and by a deeper sadness.\n\nD'Artagnan, whose inquiring disposition we are acquainted with, had\nnot--whatever interest he had in satisfying his curiosity on this\nsubject--been able to assign any cause for these fits of for the periods\nof their recurrence. Athos never received any letters; Athos never had\nconcerns which all his friends did not know.\n\nIt could not be said that it was wine which produced this sadness; for\nin truth he only drank to combat this sadness, which wine however, as we\nhave said, rendered still darker. This excess of bilious humor could\nnot be attributed to play; for unlike Porthos, who accompanied the\nvariations of chance with songs or oaths, Athos when he won remained\nas unmoved as when he lost. He had been known, in the circle of the\nMusketeers, to win in one night three thousand pistoles; to lose them\neven to the gold-embroidered belt for gala days, win all this again with\nthe addition of a hundred louis, without his beautiful eyebrow being\nheightened or lowered half a line, without his hands losing their pearly\nhue, without his conversation, which was cheerful that evening, ceasing\nto be calm and agreeable.\n\nNeither was it, as with our neighbors, the English, an atmospheric\ninfluence which darkened his countenance; for the sadness generally\nbecame more intense toward the fine season of the year. June and July\nwere the terrible months with Athos.\n\nFor the present he had no anxiety. He shrugged his shoulders when people\nspoke of the future. His secret, then, was in the past, as had often\nbeen vaguely said to d'Artagnan.\n\nThis mysterious shade, spread over his whole person, rendered still\nmore interesting the man whose eyes or mouth, even in the most complete\nintoxication, had never revealed anything, however skillfully questions\nhad been put to him.\n\n\"Well,\" thought d'Artagnan, \"poor Athos is perhaps at this moment dead,\nand dead by my fault--for it was I who dragged him into this affair, of\nwhich he did not know the origin, of which he is ignorant of the result,\nand from which he can derive no advantage.\"\n\n\"Without reckoning, monsieur,\" added Planchet to his master's audibly\nexpressed reflections, \"that we perhaps owe our lives to him. Do you\nremember how he cried, 'On, d'Artagnan, on, I am taken'? And when he\nhad discharged his two pistols, what a terrible noise he made with his\nsword! One might have said that twenty men, or rather twenty mad devils,\nwere fighting.\"\n\nThese words redoubled the eagerness of d'Artagnan, who urged his horse,\nthough he stood in need of no incitement, and they proceeded at a rapid\npace. About eleven o'clock in the morning they perceived Ameins, and at\nhalf past eleven they were at the door of the cursed inn.\n\nD'Artagnan had often meditated against the perfidious host one of those\nhearty vengeances which offer consolation while they are hoped for. He\nentered the hostelry with his hat pulled over his eyes, his left hand on\nthe pommel of the sword, and cracking his whip with his right hand.\n\n\"Do you remember me?\" said he to the host, who advanced to greet him.\n\n\"I have not that honor, monseigneur,\" replied the latter, his eyes\ndazzled by the brilliant style in which d'Artagnan traveled.\n\n\"What, you don't know me?\"\n\n\"No, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"Well, two words will refresh your memory. What have you done with that\ngentleman against whom you had the audacity, about twelve days ago, to\nmake an accusation of passing false money?\"\n\nThe host became as pale as death; for d'Artagnan had assumed a\nthreatening attitude, and Planchet modeled himself after his master.\n\n\"Ah, monseigneur, do not mention it!\" cried the host, in the most\npitiable voice imaginable. \"Ah, monseigneur, how dearly have I paid for\nthat fault, unhappy wretch as I am!\"\n\n\"That gentleman, I say, what has become of him?\"\n\n\"Deign to listen to me, monseigneur, and be merciful! Sit down, in\nmercy!\"\n\nD'Artagnan, mute with anger and anxiety, took a seat in the threatening\nattitude of a judge. Planchet glared fiercely over the back of his\narmchair.\n\n\"Here is the story, monseigneur,\" resumed the trembling host; \"for I\nnow recollect you. It was you who rode off at the moment I had that\nunfortunate difference with the gentleman you speak of.\"\n\n\"Yes, it was I; so you may plainly perceive that you have no mercy to\nexpect if you do not tell me the whole truth.\"\n\n\"Condescend to listen to me, and you shall know all.\"\n\n\"I listen.\"\n\n\"I had been warned by the authorities that a celebrated coiner of\nbad money would arrive at my inn, with several of his companions, all\ndisguised as Guards or Musketeers. Monseigneur, I was furnished with a\ndescription of your horses, your lackeys, your countenances--nothing was\nomitted.\"\n\n\"Go on, go on!\" said d'Artagnan, who quickly understood whence such an\nexact description had come.\n\n\"I took then, in conformity with the orders of the authorities, who sent\nme a reinforcement of six men, such measures as I thought necessary to\nget possession of the persons of the pretended coiners.\"\n\n\"Again!\" said d'Artagnan, whose ears chafed terribly under the\nrepetition of this word COINERs.\n\n\"Pardon me, monseigneur, for saying such things, but they form my\nexcuse. The authorities had terrified me, and you know that an innkeeper\nmust keep on good terms with the authorities.\"\n\n\"But once again, that gentleman--where is he? What has become of him? Is\nhe dead? Is he living?\"\n\n\"Patience, monseigneur, we are coming to it. There happened then that\nwhich you know, and of which your precipitate departure,\" added the\nhost, with an acuteness that did not escape d'Artagnan, \"appeared to\nauthorize the issue. That gentleman, your friend, defended himself\ndesperately. His lackey, who, by an unforeseen piece of ill luck, had\nquarreled with the officers, disguised as stable lads--\"\n\n\"Miserable scoundrel!\" cried d'Artagnan, \"you were all in the plot,\nthen! And I really don't know what prevents me from exterminating you\nall.\"\n\n\"Alas, monseigneur, we were not in the plot, as you will soon see.\nMonsieur your friend (pardon for not calling him by the honorable name\nwhich no doubt he bears, but we do not know that name), Monsieur your\nfriend, having disabled two men with his pistols, retreated fighting\nwith his sword, with which he disabled one of my men, and stunned me\nwith a blow of the flat side of it.\"\n\n\"You villain, will you finish?\" cried d'Artagnan, \"Athos--what has\nbecome of Athos?\"\n\n\"While fighting and retreating, as I have told Monseigneur, he found the\ndoor of the cellar stairs behind him, and as the door was open, he took\nout the key, and barricaded himself inside. As we were sure of finding\nhim there, we left him alone.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said d'Artagnan, \"you did not really wish to kill; you only\nwished to imprison him.\"\n\n\"Good God! To imprison him, monseigneur? Why, he imprisoned himself, I\nswear to you he did. In the first place he had made rough work of it;\none man was killed on the spot, and two others were severely wounded.\nThe dead man and the two wounded were carried off by their comrades, and\nI have heard nothing of either of them since. As for myself, as soon as\nI recovered my senses I went to Monsieur the Governor, to whom I related\nall that had passed, and asked, what I should do with my prisoner.\nMonsieur the Governor was all astonishment. He told me he knew nothing\nabout the matter, that the orders I had received did not come from him,\nand that if I had the audacity to mention his name as being concerned in\nthis disturbance he would have me hanged. It appears that I had made\na mistake, monsieur, that I had arrested the wrong person, and that he\nwhom I ought to have arrested had escaped.\"\n\n\"But Athos!\" cried d'Artagnan, whose impatience was increased by the\ndisregard of the authorities, \"Athos, where is he?\"\n\n\"As I was anxious to repair the wrongs I had done the prisoner,\" resumed\nthe innkeeper, \"I took my way straight to the cellar in order to set him\nat liberty. Ah, monsieur, he was no longer a man, he was a devil! To my\noffer of liberty, he replied that it was nothing but a snare, and that\nbefore he came out he intended to impose his own conditions. I told him\nvery humbly--for I could not conceal from myself the scrape I had got\ninto by laying hands on one of his Majesty's Musketeers--I told him I\nwas quite ready to submit to his conditions.\n\n\"'In the first place,' said he, 'I wish my lackey placed with me,\nfully armed.' We hastened to obey this order; for you will please to\nunderstand, monsieur, we were disposed to do everything your friend\ncould desire. Monsieur Grimaud (he told us his name, although he does\nnot talk much)--Monsieur Grimaud, then, went down to the cellar, wounded\nas he was; then his master, having admitted him, barricaded the door\nafresh, and ordered us to remain quietly in our own bar.\"\n\n\"But where is Athos now?\" cried d'Artagnan. \"Where is Athos?\"\n\n\"In the cellar, monsieur.\"\n\n\"What, you scoundrel! Have you kept him in the cellar all this time?\"\n\n\"Merciful heaven! No, monsieur! We keep him in the cellar! You do not\nknow what he is about in the cellar. Ah! If you could but persuade him\nto come out, monsieur, I should owe you the gratitude of my whole life;\nI should adore you as my patron saint!\"\n\n\"Then he is there? I shall find him there?\"\n\n\"Without doubt you will, monsieur; he persists in remaining there. We\nevery day pass through the air hole some bread at the end of a fork, and\nsome meat when he asks for it; but alas! It is not of bread and meat of\nwhich he makes the greatest consumption. I once endeavored to go down\nwith two of my servants; but he flew into terrible rage. I heard the\nnoise he made in loading his pistols, and his servant in loading his\nmusketoon. Then, when we asked them what were their intentions, the\nmaster replied that he had forty charges to fire, and that he and his\nlackey would fire to the last one before he would allow a single soul\nof us to set foot in the cellar. Upon this I went and complained to the\ngovernor, who replied that I only had what I deserved, and that it would\nteach me to insult honorable gentlemen who took up their abode in my\nhouse.\"\n\n\"So that since that time--\" replied d'Artagnan, totally unable to\nrefrain from laughing at the pitiable face of the host.\n\n\"So from that time, monsieur,\" continued the latter, \"we have led the\nmost miserable life imaginable; for you must know, monsieur, that all\nour provisions are in the cellar. There is our wine in bottles, and\nour wine in casks; the beer, the oil, and the spices, the bacon, and\nsausages. And as we are prevented from going down there, we are forced\nto refuse food and drink to the travelers who come to the house; so that\nour hostelry is daily going to ruin. If your friend remains another week\nin my cellar I shall be a ruined man.\"\n\n\"And not more than justice, either, you ass! Could you not perceive by\nour appearance that we were people of quality, and not coiners--say?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, you are right,\" said the host. \"But, hark, hark! There\nhe is!\"\n\n\"Somebody has disturbed him, without doubt,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"But he must be disturbed,\" cried the host; \"Here are two English\ngentlemen just arrived.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, the English like good wine, as you may know, monsieur; these have\nasked for the best. My wife has perhaps requested permission of Monsieur\nAthos to go into the cellar to satisfy these gentlemen; and he, as\nusual, has refused. Ah, good heaven! There is the hullabaloo louder than\never!\"\n\nD'Artagnan, in fact, heard a great noise on the side next the cellar.\nHe rose, and preceded by the host wringing his hands, and followed by\nPlanchet with his musketoon ready for use, he approached the scene of\naction.\n\nThe two gentlemen were exasperated; they had had a long ride, and were\ndying with hunger and thirst.\n\n\"But this is tyranny!\" cried one of them, in very good French, though\nwith a foreign accent, \"that this madman will not allow these good\npeople access to their own wine! Nonsense, let us break open the door,\nand if he is too far gone in his madness, well, we will kill him!\"\n\n\"Softly, gentlemen!\" said d'Artagnan, drawing his pistols from his belt,\n\"you will kill nobody, if you please!\"\n\n\"Good, good!\" cried the calm voice of Athos, from the other side of the\ndoor, \"let them just come in, these devourers of little children, and we\nshall see!\"\n\nBrave as they appeared to be, the two English gentlemen looked at each\nother hesitatingly. One might have thought there was in that cellar one\nof those famished ogres--the gigantic heroes of popular legends, into\nwhose cavern nobody could force their way with impunity.\n\nThere was a moment of silence; but at length the two Englishmen felt\nashamed to draw back, and the angrier one descended the five or six\nsteps which led to the cellar, and gave a kick against the door enough\nto split a wall.\n\n\"Planchet,\" said d'Artagnan, cocking his pistols, \"I will take charge of\nthe one at the top; you look to the one below. Ah, gentlemen, you want\nbattle; and you shall have it.\"\n\n\"Good God!\" cried the hollow voice of Athos, \"I can hear d'Artagnan, I\nthink.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" cried d'Artagnan, raising his voice in turn, \"I am here, my\nfriend.\"\n\n\"Ah, good, then,\" replied Athos, \"we will teach them, these door\nbreakers!\"\n\nThe gentlemen had drawn their swords, but they found themselves taken\nbetween two fires. They still hesitated an instant; but, as before,\npride prevailed, and a second kick split the door from bottom to top.\n\n\"Stand on one side, d'Artagnan, stand on one side,\" cried Athos. \"I am\ngoing to fire!\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" exclaimed d'Artagnan, whom reflection never abandoned,\n\"gentlemen, think of what you are about. Patience, Athos! You are\nrunning your heads into a very silly affair; you will be riddled. My\nlackey and I will have three shots at you, and you will get as many from\nthe cellar. You will then have our swords, with which, I can assure you,\nmy friend and I can play tolerably well. Let me conduct your business\nand my own. You shall soon have something to drink; I give you my word.\"\n\n\"If there is any left,\" grumbled the jeering voice of Athos.\n\nThe host felt a cold sweat creep down his back.\n\n\"How! 'If there is any left!'\" murmured he.\n\n\"What the devil! There must be plenty left,\" replied d'Artagnan.\n\"Be satisfied of that; these two cannot have drunk all the cellar.\nGentlemen, return your swords to their scabbards.\"\n\n\"Well, provided you replace your pistols in your belt.\"\n\n\"Willingly.\"\n\nAnd d'Artagnan set the example. Then, turning toward Planchet, he made\nhim a sign to uncock his musketoon.\n\nThe Englishmen, convinced of these peaceful proceedings, sheathed their\nswords grumblingly. The history of Athos's imprisonment was then related\nto them; and as they were really gentlemen, they pronounced the host in\nthe wrong.\n\n\"Now, gentlemen,\" said d'Artagnan, \"go up to your room again; and in ten\nminutes, I will answer for it, you shall have all you desire.\"\n\nThe Englishmen bowed and went upstairs.\n\n\"Now I am alone, my dear Athos,\" said d'Artagnan; \"open the door, I beg\nof you.\"\n\n\"Instantly,\" said Athos.\n\nThen was heard a great noise of fagots being removed and of the groaning\nof posts; these were the counterscarps and bastions of Athos, which the\nbesieged himself demolished.\n\nAn instant after, the broken door was removed, and the pale face\nof Athos appeared, who with a rapid glance took a survey of the\nsurroundings.\n\nD'Artagnan threw himself on his neck and embraced him tenderly. He then\ntried to draw him from his moist abode, but to his surprise he perceived\nthat Athos staggered.\n\n\"You are wounded,\" said he.\n\n\"I! Not at all. I am dead drunk, that's all, and never did a man more\nstrongly set about getting so. By the Lord, my good host! I must at\nleast have drunk for my part a hundred and fifty bottles.\"\n\n\"Mercy!\" cried the host, \"if the lackey has drunk only half as much as\nthe master, I am a ruined man.\"\n\n\"Grimaud is a well-bred lackey. He would never think of faring in the\nsame manner as his master; he only drank from the cask. Hark! I don't\nthink he put the faucet in again. Do you hear it? It is running now.\"\n\nD'Artagnan burst into a laugh which changed the shiver of the host into\na burning fever.\n\nIn the meantime, Grimaud appeared in his turn behind his master, with\nthe musketoon on his shoulder, and his head shaking. Like one of those\ndrunken satyrs in the pictures of Rubens. He was moistened before and\nbehind with a greasy liquid which the host recognized as his best olive\noil.\n\nThe four crossed the public room and proceeded to take possession of the\nbest apartment in the house, which d'Artagnan occupied with authority.\n\nIn the meantime the host and his wife hurried down with lamps into the\ncellar, which had so long been interdicted to them and where a frightful\nspectacle awaited them.\n\nBeyond the fortifications through which Athos had made a breach in order\nto get out, and which were composed of fagots, planks, and empty casks,\nheaped up according to all the rules of the strategic art, they found,\nswimming in puddles of oil and wine, the bones and fragments of all the\nhams they had eaten; while a heap of broken bottles filled the whole\nleft-hand corner of the cellar, and a tun, the cock of which was left\nrunning, was yielding, by this means, the last drop of its blood. \"The\nimage of devastation and death,\" as the ancient poet says, \"reigned as\nover a field of battle.\"\n\nOf fifty large sausages, suspended from the joists, scarcely ten\nremained.\n\nThen the lamentations of the host and hostess pierced the vault of the\ncellar. D'Artagnan himself was moved by them. Athos did not even turn\nhis head.\n\nTo grief succeeded rage. The host armed himself with a spit, and rushed\ninto the chamber occupied by the two friends.\n\n\"Some wine!\" said Athos, on perceiving the host.\n\n\"Some wine!\" cried the stupefied host, \"some wine? Why you have\ndrunk more than a hundred pistoles' worth! I am a ruined man, lost,\ndestroyed!\"\n\n\"Bah,\" said Athos, \"we were always dry.\"\n\n\"If you had been contented with drinking, well and good; but you have\nbroken all the bottles.\"\n\n\"You pushed me upon a heap which rolled down. That was your fault.\"\n\n\"All my oil is lost!\"\n\n\"Oil is a sovereign balm for wounds; and my poor Grimaud here was\nobliged to dress those you had inflicted on him.\"\n\n\"All my sausages are gnawed!\"\n\n\"There is an enormous quantity of rats in that cellar.\"\n\n\"You shall pay me for all this,\" cried the exasperated host.\n\n\"Triple ass!\" said Athos, rising; but he sank down again immediately. He\nhad tried his strength to the utmost. d'Artagnan came to his relief with\nhis whip in his hand.\n\nThe host drew back and burst into tears.\n\n\"This will teach you,\" said d'Artagnan, \"to treat the guests God sends\nyou in a more courteous fashion.\"\n\n\"God? Say the devil!\"\n\n\"My dear friend,\" said d'Artagnan, \"if you annoy us in this manner we\nwill all four go and shut ourselves up in your cellar, and we will see\nif the mischief is as great as you say.\"\n\n\"Oh, gentlemen,\" said the host, \"I have been wrong. I confess it, but\npardon to every sin! You are gentlemen, and I am a poor innkeeper. You\nwill have pity on me.\"\n\n\"Ah, if you speak in that way,\" said Athos, \"you will break my heart,\nand the tears will flow from my eyes as the wine flowed from the cask.\nWe are not such devils as we appear to be. Come hither, and let us\ntalk.\"\n\nThe host approached with hesitation.\n\n\"Come hither, I say, and don't be afraid,\" continued Athos. \"At the very\nmoment when I was about to pay you, I had placed my purse on the table.\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"That purse contained sixty pistoles; where is it?\"\n\n\"Deposited with the justice; they said it was bad money.\"\n\n\"Very well; get me my purse back and keep the sixty pistoles.\"\n\n\"But Monseigneur knows very well that justice never lets go that which\nit once lays hold of. If it were bad money, there might be some hopes;\nbut unfortunately, those were all good pieces.\"\n\n\"Manage the matter as well as you can, my good man; it does not concern\nme, the more so as I have not a livre left.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said d'Artagnan, \"let us inquire further. Athos's horse, where\nis that?\"\n\n\"In the stable.\"\n\n\"How much is it worth?\"\n\n\"Fifty pistoles at most.\"\n\n\"It's worth eighty. Take it, and there ends the matter.\"\n\n\"What,\" cried Athos, \"are you selling my horse--my Bajazet? And pray\nupon what shall I make my campaign; upon Grimaud?\"\n\n\"I have brought you another,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Another?\"\n\n\"And a magnificent one!\" cried the host.\n\n\"Well, since there is another finer and younger, why, you may take the\nold one; and let us drink.\"\n\n\"What?\" asked the host, quite cheerful again.\n\n\"Some of that at the bottom, near the laths. There are twenty-five\nbottles of it left; all the rest were broken by my fall. Bring six of\nthem.\"\n\n\"Why, this man is a cask!\" said the host, aside. \"If he only remains\nhere a fortnight, and pays for what he drinks, I shall soon re-establish\nmy business.\"\n\n\"And don't forget,\" said d'Artagnan, \"to bring up four bottles of the\nsame sort for the two English gentlemen.\"\n\n\"And now,\" said Athos, \"while they bring the wine, tell me, d'Artagnan,\nwhat has become of the others, come!\"\n\nD'Artagnan related how he had found Porthos in bed with a strained knee,\nand Aramis at a table between two theologians. As he finished, the host\nentered with the wine ordered and a ham which, fortunately for him, had\nbeen left out of the cellar.\n\n\"That's well!\" said Athos, filling his glass and that of his friend;\n\"here's to Porthos and Aramis! But you, d'Artagnan, what is the matter\nwith you, and what has happened to you personally? You have a sad air.\"\n\n\"Alas,\" said d'Artagnan, \"it is because I am the most unfortunate.\"\n\n\"Tell me.\"\n\n\"Presently,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Presently! And why presently? Because you think I am drunk? d'Artagnan,\nremember this! My ideas are never so clear as when I have had plenty of\nwine. Speak, then, I am all ears.\"\n\nD'Artagnan related his adventure with Mme. Bonacieux. Athos listened\nto him without a frown; and when he had finished, said, \"Trifles, only\ntrifles!\" That was his favorite word.\n\n\"You always say TRIFLES, my dear Athos!\" said d'Artagnan, \"and that come\nvery ill from you, who have never loved.\"\n\nThe drink-deadened eye of Athos flashed out, but only for a moment; it\nbecame as dull and vacant as before.\n\n\"That's true,\" said he, quietly, \"for my part I have never loved.\"\n\n\"Acknowledge, then, you stony heart,\" said d'Artagnan, \"that you are\nwrong to be so hard upon us tender hearts.\"\n\n\"Tender hearts! Pierced hearts!\" said Athos.\n\n\"What do you say?\"\n\n\"I say that love is a lottery in which he who wins, wins death! You are\nvery fortunate to have lost, believe me, my dear d'Artagnan. And if I\nhave any counsel to give, it is, always lose!\"\n\n\"She seemed to love me so!\"\n\n\"She SEEMED, did she?\"\n\n\"Oh, she DID love me!\"\n\n\"You child, why, there is not a man who has not believed, as you do,\nthat his mistress loved him, and there lives not a man who has not been\ndeceived by his mistress.\"\n\n\"Except you, Athos, who never had one.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said Athos, after a moment's silence, \"that's true! I\nnever had one! Let us drink!\"\n\n\"But then, philosopher that you are,\" said d'Artagnan, \"instruct me,\nsupport me. I stand in need of being taught and consoled.\"\n\n\"Consoled for what?\"\n\n\"For my misfortune.\"\n\n\"Your misfortune is laughable,\" said Athos, shrugging his shoulders; \"I\nshould like to know what you would say if I were to relate to you a real\ntale of love!\"\n\n\"Which has happened to you?\"\n\n\"Or one of my friends, what matters?\"\n\n\"Tell it, Athos, tell it.\"\n\n\"Better if I drink.\"\n\n\"Drink and relate, then.\"\n\n\"Not a bad idea!\" said Athos, emptying and refilling his glass. \"The two\nthings agree marvelously well.\"\n\n\"I am all attention,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\nAthos collected himself, and in proportion as he did so, d'Artagnan\nsaw that he became pale. He was at that period of intoxication in which\nvulgar drinkers fall on the floor and go to sleep. He kept himself\nupright and dreamed, without sleeping. This somnambulism of drunkenness\nhad something frightful in it.\n\n\"You particularly wish it?\" asked he.\n\n\"I pray for it,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Be it then as you desire. One of my friends--one of my friends,\nplease to observe, not myself,\" said Athos, interrupting himself with a\nmelancholy smile, \"one of the counts of my province--that is to say, of\nBerry--noble as a Dandolo or a Montmorency, at twenty-five years of\nage fell in love with a girl of sixteen, beautiful as fancy can paint.\nThrough the ingenuousness of her age beamed an ardent mind, not of the\nwoman, but of the poet. She did not please; she intoxicated. She lived\nin a small town with her brother, who was a curate. Both had recently\ncome into the country. They came nobody knew whence; but when seeing her\nso lovely and her brother so pious, nobody thought of asking whence they\ncame. They were said, however, to be of good extraction. My friend, who\nwas seigneur of the country, might have seduced her, or taken her\nby force, at his will--for he was master. Who would have come to the\nassistance of two strangers, two unknown persons? Unfortunately he was\nan honorable man; he married her. The fool! The ass! The idiot!\"\n\n\"How so, if he love her?\" asked d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Wait,\" said Athos. \"He took her to his chateau, and made her the\nfirst lady in the province; and in justice it must be allowed that she\nsupported her rank becomingly.\"\n\n\"Well?\" asked d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Well, one day when she was hunting with her husband,\" continued Athos,\nin a low voice, and speaking very quickly, \"she fell from her horse\nand fainted. The count flew to her to help, and as she appeared to be\noppressed by her clothes, he ripped them open with his ponaird, and\nin so doing laid bare her shoulder. d'Artagnan,\" said Athos, with a\nmaniacal burst of laughter, \"guess what she had on her shoulder.\"\n\n\"How can I tell?\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"A FLEUR-DE-LIS,\" said Athos. \"She was branded.\"\n\nAthos emptied at a single draught the glass he held in his hand.\n\n\"Horror!\" cried d'Artagnan. \"What do you tell me?\"\n\n\"Truth, my friend. The angel was a demon; the poor young girl had stolen\nthe sacred vessels from a church.\"\n\n\"And what did the count do?\"\n\n\"The count was of the highest nobility. He had on his estates the rights\nof high and low tribunals. He tore the dress of the countess to pieces;\nhe tied her hands behind her, and hanged her on a tree.\"\n\n\"Heavens, Athos, a murder?\" cried d'Artagnan.\n\n\"No less,\" said Athos, as pale as a corpse. \"But methinks I need wine!\"\nand he seized by the neck the last bottle that was left, put it to his\nmouth, and emptied it at a single draught, as he would have emptied an\nordinary glass.\n\nThen he let his head sink upon his two hands, while d'Artagnan stood\nbefore him, stupefied.\n\n\"That has cured me of beautiful, poetical, and loving women,\" said\nAthos, after a considerable pause, raising his head, and forgetting\nto continue the fiction of the count. \"God grant you as much! Let us\ndrink.\"\n\n\"Then she is dead?\" stammered d'Artagnan.\n\n\"PARBLEU!\" said Athos. \"But hold out your glass. Some ham, my boy, or we\ncan't drink.\"\n\n\"And her brother?\" added d'Artagnan, timidly.\n\n\"Her brother?\" replied Athos.\n\n\"Yes, the priest.\"\n\n\"Oh, I inquired after him for the purpose of hanging him likewise; but\nhe was beforehand with me, he had quit the curacy the night before.\"\n\n\"Was it ever known who this miserable fellow was?\"\n\n\"He was doubtless the first lover and accomplice of the fair lady. A\nworthy man, who had pretended to be a curate for the purpose of getting\nhis mistress married, and securing her a position. He has been hanged\nand quartered, I hope.\"\n\n\"My God, my God!\" cried d'Artagnan, quite stunned by the relation of\nthis horrible adventure.\n\n\"Taste some of this ham, d'Artagnan; it is exquisite,\" said Athos,\ncutting a slice, which he placed on the young man's plate.\n\n\"What a pity it is there were only four like this in the cellar. I could\nhave drunk fifty bottles more.\"\n\nD'Artagnan could no longer endure this conversation, which had made him\nbewildered. Allowing his head to sink upon his two hands, he pretended\nto sleep.\n\n\"These young fellows can none of them drink,\" said Athos, looking at him\nwith pity, \"and yet this is one of the best!\"\n\n\n\n\n28 THE RETURN\n\nD'Artagnan was astounded by the terrible confidence of Athos; yet many\nthings appeared very obscure to him in this half revelation. In the\nfirst place it had been made by a man quite drunk to one who was half\ndrunk; and yet, in spite of the incertainty which the vapor of three or\nfour bottles of Burgundy carries with it to the brain, d'Artagnan, when\nawaking on the following morning, had all the words of Athos as present\nto his memory as if they then fell from his mouth--they had been so\nimpressed upon his mind. All this doubt only gave rise to a more lively\ndesire of arriving at a certainty, and he went into his friend's chamber\nwith a fixed determination of renewing the conversation of the preceding\nevening; but he found Athos quite himself again--that is to say, the\nmost shrewd and impenetrable of men. Besides which, the Musketeer,\nafter having exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with him, broached the\nmatter first.\n\n\"I was pretty drunk yesterday, d'Artagnan,\" said he, \"I can tell that\nby my tongue, which was swollen and hot this morning, and by my\npulse, which was very tremulous. I wager that I uttered a thousand\nextravagances.\"\n\nWhile saying this he looked at his friend with an earnestness that\nembarrassed him.\n\n\"No,\" replied d'Artagnan, \"if I recollect well what you said, it was\nnothing out of the common way.\"\n\n\"Ah, you surprise me. I thought I had told you a most lamentable story.\"\nAnd he looked at the young man as if he would read the bottom of his\nheart.\n\n\"My faith,\" said d'Artagnan, \"it appears that I was more drunk than you,\nsince I remember nothing of the kind.\"\n\nAthos did not trust this reply, and he resumed; \"you cannot have failed\nto remark, my dear friend, that everyone has his particular kind of\ndrunkenness, sad or gay. My drunkenness is always sad, and when I am\nthoroughly drunk my mania is to relate all the lugubrious stories which\nmy foolish nurse inculcated into my brain. That is my failing--a capital\nfailing, I admit; but with that exception, I am a good drinker.\"\n\nAthos spoke this in so natural a manner that d'Artagnan was shaken in\nhis conviction.\n\n\"It is that, then,\" replied the young man, anxious to find out the\ntruth, \"it is that, then, I remember as we remember a dream. We were\nspeaking of hanging.\"\n\n\"Ah, you see how it is,\" said Athos, becoming still paler, but yet\nattempting to laugh; \"I was sure it was so--the hanging of people is my\nnightmare.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" replied d'Artagnan. \"I remember now; yes, it was about--stop\na minute--yes, it was about a woman.\"\n\n\"That's it,\" replied Athos, becoming almost livid; \"that is my grand\nstory of the fair lady, and when I relate that, I must be very drunk.\"\n\n\"Yes, that was it,\" said d'Artagnan, \"the story of a tall, fair lady,\nwith blue eyes.\"\n\n\"Yes, who was hanged.\"\n\n\"By her husband, who was a nobleman of your acquaintance,\" continued\nd'Artagnan, looking intently at Athos.\n\n\"Well, you see how a man may compromise himself when he does not know\nwhat he says,\" replied Athos, shrugging his shoulders as if he thought\nhimself an object of pity. \"I certainly never will get drunk again,\nd'Artagnan; it is too bad a habit.\"\n\nD'Artagnan remained silent; and then changing the conversation all at\nonce, Athos said:\n\n\"By the by, I thank you for the horse you have brought me.\"\n\n\"Is it to your mind?\" asked d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes; but it is not a horse for hard work.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken; I rode him nearly ten leagues in less than an hour\nand a half, and he appeared no more distressed than if he had only made\nthe tour of the Place St. Sulpice.\"\n\n\"Ah, you begin to awaken my regret.\"\n\n\"Regret?\"\n\n\"Yes; I have parted with him.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Why, here is the simple fact. This morning I awoke at six o'clock. You\nwere still fast asleep, and I did not know what to do with myself; I\nwas still stupid from our yesterday's debauch. As I came into the public\nroom, I saw one of our Englishman bargaining with a dealer for a horse,\nhis own having died yesterday from bleeding. I drew near, and found he\nwas bidding a hundred pistoles for a chestnut nag. 'PARDIEU,' said I,\n'my good gentleman, I have a horse to sell, too.' 'Ay, and a very fine\none! I saw him yesterday; your friend's lackey was leading him.' 'Do you\nthink he is worth a hundred pistoles?' 'Yes! Will you sell him to me for\nthat sum?' 'No; but I will play for him.' 'What?' 'At dice.' No sooner\nsaid than done, and I lost the horse. Ah, ah! But please to observe I\nwon back the equipage,\" cried Athos.\n\nD'Artagnan looked much disconcerted.\n\n\"This vexes you?\" said Athos.\n\n\"Well, I must confess it does,\" replied d'Artagnan. \"That horse was to\nhave identified us in the day of battle. It was a pledge, a remembrance.\nAthos, you have done wrong.\"\n\n\"But, my dear friend, put yourself in my place,\" replied the Musketeer.\n\"I was hipped to death; and still further, upon my honor, I don't like\nEnglish horses. If it is only to be recognized, why the saddle will\nsuffice for that; it is quite remarkable enough. As to the horse, we can\neasily find some excuse for its disappearance. Why the devil! A horse is\nmortal; suppose mine had had the glanders or the farcy?\"\n\nD'Artagnan did not smile.\n\n\"It vexes me greatly,\" continued Athos, \"that you attach so much\nimportance to these animals, for I am not yet at the end of my story.\"\n\n\"What else have you done.\"\n\n\"After having lost my own horse, nine against ten--see how near--I\nformed an idea of staking yours.\"\n\n\"Yes; but you stopped at the idea, I hope?\"\n\n\"No; for I put it in execution that very minute.\"\n\n\"And the consequence?\" said d'Artagnan, in great anxiety.\n\n\"I threw, and I lost.\"\n\n\"What, my horse?\"\n\n\"Your horse, seven against eight; a point short--you know the proverb.\"\n\n\"Athos, you are not in your right senses, I swear.\"\n\n\"My dear lad, that was yesterday, when I was telling you silly stories,\nit was proper to tell me that, and not this morning. I lost him then,\nwith all his appointments and furniture.\"\n\n\"Really, this is frightful.\"\n\n\"Stop a minute; you don't know all yet. I should make an excellent\ngambler if I were not too hot-headed; but I was hot-headed, just as if I\nhad been drinking. Well, I was not hot-headed then--\"\n\n\"Well, but what else could you play for? You had nothing left?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, my friend; there was still that diamond left which sparkles on\nyour finger, and which I had observed yesterday.\"\n\n\"This diamond!\" said d'Artagnan, placing his hand eagerly on his ring.\n\n\"And as I am a connoisseur in such things, having had a few of my own\nonce, I estimated it at a thousand pistoles.\"\n\n\"I hope,\" said d'Artagnan, half dead with fright, \"you made no mention\nof my diamond?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, my dear friend, this diamond became our only resource;\nwith it I might regain our horses and their harnesses, and even money to\npay our expenses on the road.\"\n\n\"Athos, you make me tremble!\" cried d'Artagnan.\n\n\"I mentioned your diamond then to my adversary, who had likewise\nremarked it. What the devil, my dear, do you think you can wear a star\nfrom heaven on your finger, and nobody observe it? Impossible!\"\n\n\"Go on, go on, my dear fellow!\" said d'Artagnan; \"for upon my honor, you\nwill kill me with your indifference.\"\n\n\"We divided, then, this diamond into ten parts of a hundred pistoles\neach.\"\n\n\"You are laughing at me, and want to try me!\" said d'Artagnan, whom\nanger began to take by the hair, as Minerva takes Achilles, in the\nILLIAD.\n\n\"No, I do not jest, MORDIEU! I should like to have seen you in my place!\nI had been fifteen days without seeing a human face, and had been left\nto brutalize myself in the company of bottles.\"\n\n\"That was no reason for staking my diamond!\" replied d'Artagnan, closing\nhis hand with a nervous spasm.\n\n\"Hear the end. Ten parts of a hundred pistoles each, in ten throws,\nwithout revenge; in thirteen throws I had lost all--in thirteen throws.\nThe number thirteen was always fatal to me; it was on the thirteenth of\nJuly that--\"\n\n\"VENTREBLEU!\" cried d'Artagnan, rising from the table, the story of the\npresent day making him forget that of the preceding one.\n\n\"Patience!\" said Athos; \"I had a plan. The Englishman was an original; I\nhad seen him conversing that morning with Grimaud, and Grimaud had told\nme that he had made him proposals to enter into his service. I staked\nGrimaud, the silent Grimaud, divided into ten portions.\"\n\n\"Well, what next?\" said d'Artagnan, laughing in spite of himself.\n\n\"Grimaud himself, understand; and with the ten parts of Grimaud, which\nare not worth a ducatoon, I regained the diamond. Tell me, now, if\npersistence is not a virtue?\"\n\n\"My faith! But this is droll,\" cried d'Artagnan, consoled, and holding\nhis sides with laughter.\n\n\"You may guess, finding the luck turned, that I again staked the\ndiamond.\"\n\n\"The devil!\" said d'Artagnan, becoming angry again.\n\n\"I won back your harness, then your horse, then my harness, then my\nhorse, and then I lost again. In brief, I regained your harness and\nthen mine. That's where we are. That was a superb throw, so I left off\nthere.\"\n\nD'Artagnan breathed as if the whole hostelry had been removed from his\nbreast.\n\n\"Then the diamond is safe?\" said he, timidly.\n\n\"Intact, my dear friend; besides the harness of your Bucephalus and\nmine.\"\n\n\"But what is the use of harnesses without horses?\"\n\n\"I have an idea about them.\"\n\n\"Athos, you make me shudder.\"\n\n\"Listen to me. You have not played for a long time, d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"And I have no inclination to play.\"\n\n\"Swear to nothing. You have not played for a long time, I said; you\nought, then, to have a good hand.\"\n\n\"Well, what then?\"\n\n\"Well; the Englishman and his companion are still here. I remarked that\nhe regretted the horse furniture very much. You appear to think much\nof your horse. In your place I would stake the furniture against the\nhorse.\"\n\n\"But he will not wish for only one harness.\"\n\n\"Stake both, PARDIEU! I am not selfish, as you are.\"\n\n\"You would do so?\" said d'Artagnan, undecided, so strongly did the\nconfidence of Athos begin to prevail, in spite of himself.\n\n\"On my honor, in one single throw.\"\n\n\"But having lost the horses, I am particularly anxious to preserve the\nharnesses.\"\n\n\"Stake your diamond, then.\"\n\n\"This? That's another matter. Never, never!\"\n\n\"The devil!\" said Athos. \"I would propose to you to stake Planchet, but\nas that has already been done, the Englishman would not, perhaps, be\nwilling.\"\n\n\"Decidedly, my dear Athos,\" said d'Artagnan, \"I should like better not\nto risk anything.\"\n\n\"That's a pity,\" said Athos, coolly. \"The Englishman is overflowing with\npistoles. Good Lord, try one throw! One throw is soon made!\"\n\n\"And if I lose?\"\n\n\"You will win.\"\n\n\"But if I lose?\"\n\n\"Well, you will surrender the harnesses.\"\n\n\"Have with you for one throw!\" said d'Artagnan.\n\nAthos went in quest of the Englishman, whom he found in the stable,\nexamining the harnesses with a greedy eye. The opportunity was good. He\nproposed the conditions--the two harnesses, either against one horse or\na hundred pistoles. The Englishman calculated fast; the two harnesses\nwere worth three hundred pistoles. He consented.\n\nD'Artagnan threw the dice with a trembling hand, and turned up the\nnumber three; his paleness terrified Athos, who, however, consented\nhimself with saying, \"That's a sad throw, comrade; you will have the\nhorses fully equipped, monsieur.\"\n\nThe Englishman, quite triumphant, did not even give himself the trouble\nto shake the dice. He threw them on the table without looking at them,\nso sure was he of victory; d'Artagnan turned aside to conceal his ill\nhumor.\n\n\"Hold, hold, hold!\" said Athos, wit his quiet tone; \"that throw of the\ndice is extraordinary. I have not seen such a one four times in my life.\nTwo aces!\"\n\nThe Englishman looked, and was seized with astonishment. d'Artagnan\nlooked, and was seized with pleasure.\n\n\"Yes,\" continued Athos, \"four times only; once at the house of Monsieur\nCrequy; another time at my own house in the country, in my chateau\nat--when I had a chateau; a third time at Monsieur de Treville's where\nit surprised us all; and the fourth time at a cabaret, where it fell to\nmy lot, and where I lost a hundred louis and a supper on it.\"\n\n\"Then Monsieur takes his horse back again,\" said the Englishman.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Then there is no revenge?\"\n\n\"Our conditions said, 'No revenge,' you will please to recollect.\"\n\n\"That is true; the horse shall be restored to your lackey, monsieur.\"\n\n\"A moment,\" said Athos; \"with your permission, monsieur, I wish to speak\na word with my friend.\"\n\n\"Say on.\"\n\nAthos drew d'Artagnan aside.\n\n\"Well, Tempter, what more do you want with me?\" said d'Artagnan. \"You\nwant me to throw again, do you not?\"\n\n\"No, I would wish you to reflect.\"\n\n\"On what?\"\n\n\"You mean to take your horse?\"\n\n\"Without doubt.\"\n\n\"You are wrong, then. I would take the hundred pistoles. You know you\nhave staked the harnesses against the horse or a hundred pistoles, at\nyour choice.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I repeat, you are wrong. What is the use of one horse for\nus two? I could not ride behind. We should look like the two sons of\nAnmon, who had lost their brother. You cannot think of humiliating me\nby prancing along by my side on that magnificent charger. For my part,\nI should not hesitate a moment; I should take the hundred pistoles. We\nwant money for our return to Paris.\"\n\n\"I am much attached to that horse, Athos.\"\n\n\"And there again you are wrong. A horse slips and injures a joint; a\nhorse stumbles and breaks his knees to the bone; a horse eats out of a\nmanger in which a glandered horse has eaten. There is a horse, while on\nthe contrary, the hundred pistoles feed their master.\"\n\n\"But how shall we get back?\"\n\n\"Upon our lackey's horses, PARDIEU. Anybody may see by our bearing that\nwe are people of condition.\"\n\n\"Pretty figures we shall cut on ponies while Aramis and Porthos caracole\non their steeds.\"\n\n\"Aramis! Porthos!\" cried Athos, and laughed aloud.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked d'Artagnan, who did not at all comprehend the\nhilarity of his friend.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing! Go on!\"\n\n\"Your advice, then?\"\n\n\"To take the hundred pistoles, d'Artagnan. With the hundred pistoles we\ncan live well to the end of the month. We have undergone a great deal of\nfatigue, remember, and a little rest will do no harm.\"\n\n\"I rest? Oh, no, Athos. Once in Paris, I shall prosecute my search for\nthat unfortunate woman!\"\n\n\"Well, you may be assured that your horse will not be half so\nserviceable to you for that purpose as good golden louis. Take the\nhundred pistoles, my friend; take the hundred pistoles!\"\n\nD'Artagnan only required one reason to be satisfied. This last reason\nappeared convincing. Besides, he feared that by resisting longer he\nshould appear selfish in the eyes of Athos. He acquiesced, therefore,\nand chose the hundred pistoles, which the Englishman paid down on the\nspot.\n\nThey then determined to depart. Peace with the landlord, in addition to\nAthos's old horse, cost six pistoles. D'Artagnan and Athos took the nags\nof Planchet and Grimaud, and the two lackeys started on foot, carrying\nthe saddles on their heads.\n\nHowever ill our two friends were mounted, they were soon far in advance\nof their servants, and arrived at Creveccoeur. From a distance they\nperceived Aramis, seated in a melancholy manner at his window, looking\nout, like Sister Anne, at the dust in the horizon.\n\n\"HOLA, Aramis! What the devil are you doing there?\" cried the two\nfriends.\n\n\"Ah, is that you, d'Artagnan, and you, Athos?\" said the young man. \"I\nwas reflecting upon the rapidity with which the blessings of this world\nleave us. My English horse, which has just disappeared amid a cloud\nof dust, has furnished me with a living image of the fragility of the\nthings of the earth. Life itself may be resolved into three words: ERAT,\nEST, FUIT.\"\n\n\"Which means--\" said d'Artagnan, who began to suspect the truth.\n\n\"Which means that I have just been duped-sixty louis for a horse which\nby the manner of his gait can do at least five leagues an hour.\"\n\nD'Artagnan and Athos laughed aloud.\n\n\"My dear d'Artagnan,\" said Aramis, \"don't be too angry with me, I\nbeg. Necessity has no law; besides, I am the person punished, as that\nrascally horsedealer has robbed me of fifty louis, at least. Ah, you\nfellows are good managers! You ride on our lackey's horses, and have\nyour own gallant steeds led along carefully by hand, at short stages.\"\n\nAt the same instant a market cart, which some minutes before had\nappeared upon the Amiens road, pulled up at the inn, and Planchet and\nGrimaud came out of it with the saddles on their heads. The cart was\nreturning empty to Paris, and the two lackeys had agreed, for their\ntransport, to slake the wagoner's thirst along the route.\n\n\"What is this?\" said Aramis, on seeing them arrive. \"Nothing but\nsaddles?\"\n\n\"Now do you understand?\" said Athos.\n\n\"My friends, that's exactly like me! I retained my harness by instinct.\nHOLA, Bazin! Bring my new saddle and carry it along with those of these\ngentlemen.\"\n\n\"And what have you done with your ecclesiastics?\" asked d'Artagnan.\n\n\"My dear fellow, I invited them to a dinner the next day,\" replied\nAramis. \"They have some capital wine here--please to observe that in\npassing. I did my best to make them drunk. Then the curate forbade me\nto quit my uniform, and the Jesuit entreated me to get him made a\nMusketeer.\"\n\n\"Without a thesis?\" cried d'Artagnan, \"without a thesis? I demand the\nsuppression of the thesis.\"\n\n\"Since then,\" continued Aramis, \"I have lived very agreeably. I have\nbegun a poem in verses of one syllable. That is rather difficult,\nbut the merit in all things consists in the difficulty. The matter is\ngallant. I will read you the first canto. It has four hundred lines, and\nlasts a minute.\"\n\n\"My faith, my dear Aramis,\" said d'Artagnan, who detested verses almost\nas much as he did Latin, \"add to the merit of the difficulty that of the\nbrevity, and you are sure that your poem will at least have two merits.\"\n\n\"You will see,\" continued Aramis, \"that it breathes irreproachable\npassion. And so, my friends, we return to Paris? Bravo! I am ready. We\nare going to rejoin that good fellow, Porthos. So much the better. You\ncan't think how I have missed him, the great simpleton. To see him so\nself-satisfied reconciles me with myself. He would not sell his horse;\nnot for a kingdom! I think I can see him now, mounted upon his superb\nanimal and seated in his handsome saddle. I am sure he will look like\nthe Great Mogul!\"\n\nThey made a halt for an hour to refresh their horses. Aramis discharged\nhis bill, placed Bazin in the cart with his comrades, and they set\nforward to join Porthos.\n\nThey found him up, less pale than when d'Artagnan left him after his\nfirst visit, and seated at a table on which, though he was alone, was\nspread enough for four persons. This dinner consisted of meats nicely\ndressed, choice wines, and superb fruit.\n\n\"Ah, PARDIEU!\" said he, rising, \"you come in the nick of time,\ngentlemen. I was just beginning the soup, and you will dine with me.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" said d'Artagnan, \"Mousqueton has not caught these bottles with\nhis lasso. Besides, here is a piquant FRICANDEAU and a fillet of beef.\"\n\n\"I am recruiting myself,\" said Porthos, \"I am recruiting myself. Nothing\nweakens a man more than these devilish strains. Did you ever suffer from\na strain, Athos?\"\n\n\"Never! Though I remember, in our affair of the Rue Ferou, I received\na sword wound which at the end of fifteen or eighteen days produced the\nsame effect.\"\n\n\"But this dinner was not intended for you alone, Porthos?\" said Aramis.\n\n\"No,\" said Porthos, \"I expected some gentlemen of the neighborhood, who\nhave just sent me word they could not come. You will take their places\nand I shall not lose by the exchange. HOLA, Mousqueton, seats, and order\ndouble the bottles!\"\n\n\"Do you know what we are eating here?\" said Athos, at the end of ten\nminutes.\n\n\"PARDIEU!\" replied d'Artagnan, \"for my part, I am eating veal garnished\nwith shrimps and vegetables.\"\n\n\"And I some lamb chops,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"And I a plain chicken,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"You are all mistaken, gentlemen,\" answered Athos, gravely; \"you are\neating horse.\"\n\n\"Eating what?\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Horse!\" said Aramis, with a grimace of disgust.\n\nPorthos alone made no reply.\n\n\"Yes, horse. Are we not eating a horse, Porthos? And perhaps his saddle,\ntherewith.\"\n\n\"No, gentlemen, I have kept the harness,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"My faith,\" said Aramis, \"we are all alike. One would think we had\ntipped the wink.\"\n\n\"What could I do?\" said Porthos. \"This horse made my visitors ashamed of\ntheirs, and I don't like to humiliate people.\"\n\n\"Then your duchess is still at the waters?\" asked d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Still,\" replied Porthos. \"And, my faith, the governor of the\nprovince--one of the gentlemen I expected today--seemed to have such a\nwish for him, that I gave him to him.\"\n\n\"Gave him?\" cried d'Artagnan.\n\n\"My God, yes, GAVE, that is the word,\" said Porthos; \"for the animal was\nworth at least a hundred and fifty louis, and the stingy fellow would\nonly give me eighty.\"\n\n\"Without the saddle?\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Yes, without the saddle.\"\n\n\"You will observe, gentlemen,\" said Athos, \"that Porthos has made the\nbest bargain of any of us.\"\n\nAnd then commenced a roar of laughter in which they all joined, to the\nastonishment of poor Porthos; but when he was informed of the cause of\ntheir hilarity, he shared it vociferously according to his custom.\n\n\"There is one comfort, we are all in cash,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Well, for my part,\" said Athos, \"I found Aramis's Spanish wine so good\nthat I sent on a hamper of sixty bottles of it in the wagon with the\nlackeys. That has weakened my purse.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said Aramis, \"imagined that I had given almost my last sou to\nthe church of Montdidier and the Jesuits of Amiens, with whom I had\nmade engagements which I ought to have kept. I have ordered Masses for\nmyself, and for you, gentlemen, which will be said, gentlemen, for which\nI have not the least doubt you will be marvelously benefited.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said Porthos, \"do you think my strain cost me nothing?--without\nreckoning Mousqueton's wound, for which I had to have the surgeon twice\na day, and who charged me double on account of that foolish Mousqueton\nhaving allowed himself a ball in a part which people generally only show\nto an apothecary; so I advised him to try never to get wounded there any\nmore.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay!\" said Athos, exchanging a smile with d'Artagnan and Aramis, \"it\nis very clear you acted nobly with regard to the poor lad; that is like\na good master.\"\n\n\"In short,\" said Porthos, \"when all my expenses are paid, I shall have,\nat most, thirty crowns left.\"\n\n\"And I about ten pistoles,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Well, then it appears that we are the Croesuses of the society. How\nmuch have you left of your hundred pistoles, d'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"Of my hundred pistoles? Why, in the first place I gave you fifty.\"\n\n\"You think so?\"\n\n\"PARDIEU!\"\n\n\"Ah, that is true. I recollect.\"\n\n\"Then I paid the host six.\"\n\n\"What a brute of a host! Why did you give him six pistoles?\"\n\n\"You told me to give them to him.\"\n\n\"It is true; I am too good-natured. In brief, how much remains?\"\n\n\"Twenty-five pistoles,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"And I,\" said Athos, taking some small change from his pocket, \"I--\"\n\n\"You? Nothing!\"\n\n\"My faith! So little that it is not worth reckoning with the general\nstock.\"\n\n\"Now, then, let us calculate how much we posses in all.\"\n\n\"Porthos?\"\n\n\"Thirty crowns.\"\n\n\"Aramis?\"\n\n\"Ten pistoles.\"\n\n\"And you, d'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"Twenty-five.\"\n\n\"That makes in all?\" said Athos.\n\n\"Four hundred and seventy-five livres,\" said d'Artagnan, who reckoned\nlike Archimedes.\n\n\"On our arrival in Paris, we shall still have four hundred, besides the\nharnesses,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"But our troop horses?\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Well, of the four horses of our lackeys we will make two for the\nmasters, for which we will draw lots. With the four hundred livres we\nwill make the half of one for one of the unmounted, and then we will\ngive the turnings out of our pockets to d'Artagnan, who has a steady\nhand, and will go and play in the first gaming house we come to. There!\"\n\n\"Let us dine, then,\" said Porthos; \"it is getting cold.\"\n\nThe friends, at ease with regard to the future, did honor to the repast,\nthe remains of which were abandoned to Mousqueton, Bazin, Planchet, and\nGrimaud.\n\nOn arriving in Paris, d'Artagnan found a letter from M. de Treville,\nwhich informed him that, at his request, the king had promised that he\nshould enter the company of the Musketeers.\n\nAs this was the height of d'Artagnan's worldly ambition--apart, be it\nwell understood, from his desire of finding Mme. Bonacieux--he ran, full\nof joy, to seek his comrades, whom he had left only half an hour before,\nbut whom he found very sad and deeply preoccupied. They were assembled\nin council at the residence of Athos, which always indicated an event of\nsome gravity. M. de Treville had intimated to them his Majesty's fixed\nintention to open the campaign on the first of May, and they must\nimmediately prepare their outfits.\n\n\nThe four philosophers looked at one another in a state of bewilderment.\nM. de Treville never jested in matters relating to discipline.\n\n\"And what do you reckon your outfit will cost?\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Oh, we can scarcely say. We have made our calculations with Spartan\neconomy, and we each require fifteen hundred livres.\"\n\n\"Four times fifteen makes sixty--six thousand livres,\" said Athos.\n\n\"It seems to me,\" said d'Artagnan, \"with a thousand livres each--I do\nnot speak as a Spartan, but as a procurator--\"\n\nThis word PROCURATOR roused Porthos. \"Stop,\" said he, \"I have an idea.\"\n\n\"Well, that's something, for I have not the shadow of one,\" said Athos\ncoolly; \"but as to d'Artagnan, gentlemen, the idea of belonging to OURS\nhas driven him out of his senses. A thousand livres! For my part, I\ndeclare I want two thousand.\"\n\n\"Four times two makes eight,\" then said Aramis; \"it is eight thousand\nthat we want to complete our outfits, toward which, it is true, we have\nalready the saddles.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" said Athos, waiting till d'Artagnan, who went to thank\nMonsieur de Treville, had shut the door, \"besides, there is that\nbeautiful ring which beams from the finger of our friend. What the\ndevil! D'Artagnan is too good a comrade to leave his brothers in\nembarrassment while he wears the ransom of a king on his finger.\"\n\n\n\n\n29 HUNTING FOR THE EQUIPMENTS\n\nThe most preoccupied of the four friends was certainly d'Artagnan,\nalthough he, in his quality of Guardsman, would be much more easily\nequipped than Messieurs the Musketeers, who were all of high rank; but\nour Gascon cadet was, as may have been observed, of a provident and\nalmost avaricious character, and with that (explain the contradiction)\nso vain as almost to rival Porthos. To this preoccupation of his vanity,\nd'Artagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less selfish.\nNotwithstanding all his inquiries respecting Mme. Bonacieux, he could\nobtain no intelligence of her. M. de Treville had spoken of her to the\nqueen. The queen was ignorant where the mercer's young wife was, but had\npromised to have her sought for; but this promise was very vague and did\nnot at all reassure d'Artagnan.\n\nAthos did not leave his chamber; he made up his mind not to take a\nsingle step to equip himself.\n\n\"We have still fifteen days before us,\" said he to his friends, \"well,\nif at the end of a fortnight I have found nothing, or rather if nothing\nhas come to find me, as I, too good a Catholic to kill myself with a\npistol bullet, I will seek a good quarrel with four of his Eminence's\nGuards or with eight Englishmen, and I will fight until one of them has\nkilled me, which, considering the number, cannot fail to happen. It\nwill then be said of me that I died for the king; so that I shall have\nperformed my duty without the expense of an outfit.\"\n\nPorthos continued to walk about with his hands behind him, tossing his\nhead and repeating, \"I shall follow up on my idea.\"\n\nAramis, anxious and negligently dressed, said nothing.\n\nIt may be seen by these disastrous details that desolation reigned in\nthe community.\n\nThe lackeys on their part, like the coursers of Hippolytus, shared the\nsadness of their masters. Mousqueton collected a store of crusts; Bazin,\nwho had always been inclined to devotion, never quit the churches;\nPlanchet watched the flight of flies; and Grimaud, whom the general\ndistress could not induce to break the silence imposed by his master,\nheaved sighs enough to soften the stones.\n\nThe three friends--for, as we have said, Athos had sworn not to stir a\nfoot to equip himself--went out early in the morning, and returned late\nat night. They wandered about the streets, looking at the pavement as\nif to see whether the passengers had not left a purse behind them. They\nmight have been supposed to be following tracks, so observant were they\nwherever they went. When they met they looked desolately at one another,\nas much as to say, \"Have you found anything?\"\n\nHowever, as Porthos had first found an idea, and had thought of it\nearnestly afterward, he was the first to act. He was a man of execution,\nthis worthy Porthos. D'Artagnan perceived him one day walking toward\nthe church of St. Leu, and followed him instinctively. He entered, after\nhaving twisted his mustache and elongated his imperial, which always\nannounced on his part the most triumphant resolutions. As d'Artagnan\ntook some precautions to conceal himself, Porthos believed he had\nnot been seen. d'Artagnan entered behind him. Porthos went and leaned\nagainst the side of a pillar. D'Artagnan, still unperceived, supported\nhimself against the other side.\n\nThere happened to be a sermon, which made the church very full of\npeople. Porthos took advantage of this circumstance to ogle the women.\nThanks to the cares of Mousqueton, the exterior was far from announcing\nthe distress of the interior. His hat was a little napless, his feather\nwas a little faded, his gold lace was a little tarnished, his laces were\na trifle frayed; but in the obscurity of the church these things were\nnot seen, and Porthos was still the handsome Porthos.\n\nD'Artagnan observed, on the bench nearest to the pillar against which\nPorthos leaned, a sort of ripe beauty, rather yellow and rather dry,\nbut erect and haughty under her black hood. The eyes of Porthos were\nfurtively cast upon this lady, and then roved about at large over the\nnave.\n\nOn her side the lady, who from time to time blushed, darted with the\nrapidity of lightning a glance toward the inconstant Porthos; and then\nimmediately the eyes of Porthos wandered anxiously. It was plain that\nthis mode of proceeding piqued the lady in the black hood, for she bit\nher lips till they bled, scratched the end of her nose, and could not\nsit still in her seat.\n\nPorthos, seeing this, retwisted his mustache, elongated his imperial a\nsecond time, and began to make signals to a beautiful lady who was near\nthe choir, and who not only was a beautiful lady, but still further, no\ndoubt, a great lady--for she had behind her a Negro boy who had brought\nthe cushion on which she knelt, and a female servant who held the\nemblazoned bag in which was placed the book from which she read the\nMass.\n\nThe lady with the black hood followed through all their wanderings the\nlooks of Porthos, and perceived that they rested upon the lady with the\nvelvet cushion, the little Negro, and the maid-servant.\n\nDuring this time Porthos played close. It was almost imperceptible\nmotions of his eyes, fingers placed upon the lips, little assassinating\nsmiles, which really did assassinate the disdained beauty.\n\nThen she cried, \"Ahem!\" under cover of the MEA CULPA, striking her\nbreast so vigorously that everybody, even the lady with the red cushion,\nturned round toward her. Porthos paid no attention. Nevertheless, he\nunderstood it all, but was deaf.\n\nThe lady with the red cushion produced a great effect--for she was\nvery handsome--upon the lady with the black hood, who saw in her a rival\nreally to be dreaded; a great effect upon Porthos, who thought her\nmuch prettier than the lady with the black hood; a great effect upon\nd'Artagnan, who recognized in her the lady of Meung, of Calais, and of\nDover, whom his persecutor, the man with the scar, had saluted by the\nname of Milady.\n\nD'Artagnan, without losing sight of the lady of the red cushion,\ncontinued to watch the proceedings of Porthos, which amused him greatly.\nHe guessed that the lady of the black hood was the procurator's wife of\nthe Rue aux Ours, which was the more probable from the church of St. Leu\nbeing not far from that locality.\n\nHe guessed, likewise, by induction, that Porthos was taking his revenge\nfor the defeat of Chantilly, when the procurator's wife had proved so\nrefractory with respect to her purse.\n\nAmid all this, d'Artagnan remarked also that not one countenance\nresponded to the gallantries of Porthos. There were only chimeras and\nillusions; but for real love, for true jealousy, is there any reality\nexcept illusions and chimeras?\n\nThe sermon over, the procurator's wife advanced toward the holy font.\nPorthos went before her, and instead of a finger, dipped his whole hand\nin. The procurator's wife smiled, thinking that it was for her Porthos\nhad put himself to this trouble; but she was cruelly and promptly\nundeceived. When she was only about three steps from him, he turned\nhis head round, fixing his eyes steadfastly upon the lady with the red\ncushion, who had risen and was approaching, followed by her black boy\nand her woman.\n\nWhen the lady of the red cushion came close to Porthos, Porthos drew his\ndripping hand from the font. The fair worshipper touched the great\nhand of Porthos with her delicate fingers, smiled, made the sign of the\ncross, and left the church.\n\nThis was too much for the procurator's wife; she doubted not there was\nan intrigue between this lady and Porthos. If she had been a great lady\nshe would have fainted; but as she was only a procurator's wife, she\ncontented herself saying to the Musketeer with concentrated fury, \"Eh,\nMonsieur Porthos, you don't offer me any holy water?\"\n\nPorthos, at the sound of that voice, started like a man awakened from a\nsleep of a hundred years.\n\n\"Ma-madame!\" cried he; \"is that you? How is your husband, our dear\nMonsieur Coquenard? Is he still as stingy as ever? Where can my eyes\nhave been not to have seen you during the two hours of the sermon?\"\n\n\"I was within two paces of you, monsieur,\" replied the procurator's\nwife; \"but you did not perceive me because you had no eyes but for the\npretty lady to whom you just now gave the holy water.\"\n\nPorthos pretended to be confused. \"Ah,\" said he, \"you have remarked--\"\n\n\"I must have been blind not to have seen.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Porthos, \"that is a duchess of my acquaintance whom I have\ngreat trouble to meet on account of the jealousy of her husband, and who\nsent me word that she should come today to this poor church, buried in\nthis vile quarter, solely for the sake of seeing me.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Porthos,\" said the procurator's wife, \"will you have the\nkindness to offer me your arm for five minutes? I have something to say\nto you.\"\n\n\"Certainly, madame,\" said Porthos, winking to himself, as a gambler does\nwho laughs at the dupe he is about to pluck.\n\nAt that moment d'Artagnan passed in pursuit of Milady; he cast a passing\nglance at Porthos, and beheld this triumphant look.\n\n\"Eh, eh!\" said he, reasoning to himself according to the strangely easy\nmorality of that gallant period, \"there is one who will be equipped in\ngood time!\"\n\nPorthos, yielding to the pressure of the arm of the procurator's wife,\nas a bark yields to the rudder, arrived at the cloister St. Magloire--a\nlittle-frequented passage, enclosed with a turnstile at each end. In the\ndaytime nobody was seen there but mendicants devouring their crusts, and\nchildren at play.\n\n\"Ah, Monsieur Porthos,\" cried the procurator's wife, when she was\nassured that no one who was a stranger to the population of the locality\ncould either see or hear her, \"ah, Monsieur Porthos, you are a great\nconqueror, as it appears!\"\n\n\"I, madame?\" said Porthos, drawing himself up proudly; \"how so?\"\n\n\"The signs just now, and the holy water! But that must be a princess, at\nleast--that lady with her Negro boy and her maid!\"\n\n\"My God! Madame, you are deceived,\" said Porthos; \"she is simply a\nduchess.\"\n\n\"And that running footman who waited at the door, and that carriage with\na coachman in grand livery who sat waiting on his seat?\"\n\nPorthos had seen neither the footman nor the carriage, but with the eye\nof a jealous woman, Mme. Coquenard had seen everything.\n\nPorthos regretted that he had not at once made the lady of the red\ncushion a princess.\n\n\"Ah, you are quite the pet of the ladies, Monsieur Porthos!\" resumed the\nprocurator's wife, with a sigh.\n\n\"Well,\" responded Porthos, \"you may imagine, with the physique with\nwhich nature has endowed me, I am not in want of good luck.\"\n\n\"Good Lord, how quickly men forget!\" cried the procurator's wife,\nraising her eyes toward heaven.\n\n\"Less quickly than the women, it seems to me,\" replied Porthos; \"for\nI, madame, I may say I was your victim, when wounded, dying, I was\nabandoned by the surgeons. I, the offspring of a noble family, who\nplaced reliance upon your friendship--I was near dying of my wounds at\nfirst, and of hunger afterward, in a beggarly inn at Chantilly, without\nyou ever deigning once to reply to the burning letters I addressed to\nyou.\"\n\n\"But, Monsieur Porthos,\" murmured the procurator's wife, who began to\nfeel that, to judge by the conduct of the great ladies of the time, she\nwas wrong.\n\n\"I, who had sacrificed for you the Baronne de--\"\n\n\"I know it well.\"\n\n\"The Comtesse de--\"\n\n\"Monsieur Porthos, be generous!\"\n\n\"You are right, madame, and I will not finish.\"\n\n\"But it was my husband who would not hear of lending.\"\n\n\"Madame Coquenard,\" said Porthos, \"remember the first letter you wrote\nme, and which I preserve engraved in my memory.\"\n\nThe procurator's wife uttered a groan.\n\n\"Besides,\" said she, \"the sum you required me to borrow was rather\nlarge.\"\n\n\"Madame Coquenard, I gave you the preference. I had but to write to\nthe Duchesse--but I won't repeat her name, for I am incapable of\ncompromising a woman; but this I know, that I had but to write to her\nand she would have sent me fifteen hundred.\"\n\nThe procurator's wife shed a tear.\n\n\"Monsieur Porthos,\" said she, \"I can assure you that you have severely\npunished me; and if in the time to come you should find yourself in a\nsimilar situation, you have but to apply to me.\"\n\n\"Fie, madame, fie!\" said Porthos, as if disgusted. \"Let us not talk\nabout money, if you please; it is humiliating.\"\n\n\"Then you no longer love me!\" said the procurator's wife, slowly and\nsadly.\n\nPorthos maintained a majestic silence.\n\n\"And that is the only reply you make? Alas, I understand.\"\n\n\"Think of the offense you have committed toward me, madame! It remains\nHERE!\" said Porthos, placing his hand on his heart, and pressing it\nstrongly.\n\n\"I will repair it, indeed I will, my dear Porthos.\"\n\n\"Besides, what did I ask of you?\" resumed Porthos, with a movement of\nthe shoulders full of good fellowship. \"A loan, nothing more! After all,\nI am not an unreasonable man. I know you are not rich, Madame Coquenard,\nand that your husband is obliged to bleed his poor clients to squeeze a\nfew paltry crowns from them. Oh! If you were a duchess, a marchioness,\nor a countess, it would be quite a different thing; it would be\nunpardonable.\"\n\nThe procurator's wife was piqued.\n\n\"Please to know, Monsieur Porthos,\" said she, \"that my strongbox, the\nstrongbox of a procurator's wife though it may be, is better filled than\nthose of your affected minxes.\"\n\n\"The doubles the offense,\" said Porthos, disengaging his arm from that\nof the procurator's wife; \"for if you are rich, Madame Coquenard, then\nthere is no excuse for your refusal.\"\n\n\"When I said rich,\" replied the procurator's wife, who saw that she had\ngone too far, \"you must not take the word literally. I am not precisely\nrich, though I am pretty well off.\"\n\n\"Hold, madame,\" said Porthos, \"let us say no more upon the subject, I\nbeg of you. You have misunderstood me, all sympathy is extinct between\nus.\"\n\n\"Ingrate that you are!\"\n\n\"Ah! I advise you to complain!\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Begone, then, to your beautiful duchess; I will detain you no longer.\"\n\n\"And she is not to be despised, in my opinion.\"\n\n\"Now, Monsieur Porthos, once more, and this is the last! Do you love me\nstill?\"\n\n\"Ah, madame,\" said Porthos, in the most melancholy tone he could assume,\n\"when we are about to enter upon a campaign--a campaign, in which my\npresentiments tell me I shall be killed--\"\n\n\"Oh, don't talk of such things!\" cried the procurator's wife, bursting\ninto tears.\n\n\"Something whispers me so,\" continued Porthos, becoming more and more\nmelancholy.\n\n\"Rather say that you have a new love.\"\n\n\"Not so; I speak frankly to you. No object affects me; and I even feel\nhere, at the bottom of my heart, something which speaks for you. But in\nfifteen days, as you know, or as you do not know, this fatal campaign\nis to open. I shall be fearfully preoccupied with my outfit. Then I\nmust make a journey to see my family, in the lower part of Brittany, to\nobtain the sum necessary for my departure.\"\n\nPorthos observed a last struggle between love and avarice.\n\n\"And as,\" continued he, \"the duchess whom you saw at the church\nhas estates near to those of my family, we mean to make the journey\ntogether. Journeys, you know, appear much shorter when we travel two in\ncompany.\"\n\n\"Have you no friends in Paris, then, Monsieur Porthos?\" said the\nprocurator's wife.\n\n\"I thought I had,\" said Porthos, resuming his melancholy air; \"but I\nhave been taught my mistake.\"\n\n\"You have some!\" cried the procurator's wife, in a transport that\nsurprised even herself. \"Come to our house tomorrow. You are the son of\nmy aunt, consequently my cousin; you come from Noyon, in Picardy; you\nhave several lawsuits and no attorney. Can you recollect all that?\"\n\n\"Perfectly, madame.\"\n\n\"Come at dinnertime.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\"And be upon your guard before my husband, who is rather shrewd,\nnotwithstanding his seventy-six years.\"\n\n\"Seventy-six years! PESTE! That's a fine age!\" replied Porthos.\n\n\"A great age, you mean, Monsieur Porthos. Yes, the poor man may be\nexpected to leave me a widow, any hour,\" continued she, throwing a\nsignificant glance at Porthos. \"Fortunately, by our marriage contract,\nthe survivor takes everything.\"\n\n\"All?\"\n\n\"Yes, all.\"\n\n\"You are a woman of precaution, I see, my dear Madame Coquenard,\" said\nPorthos, squeezing the hand of the procurator's wife tenderly.\n\n\"We are then reconciled, dear Monsieur Porthos?\" said she, simpering.\n\n\"For life,\" replied Porthos, in the same manner.\n\n\"Till we meet again, then, dear traitor!\"\n\n\"Till we meet again, my forgetful charmer!\"\n\n\"Tomorrow, my angel!\"\n\n\"Tomorrow, flame of my life!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n30 D'ARTAGNAN AND THE ENGLISHMAN\n\nD'Artagnan followed Milady without being perceived by her. He saw her\nget into her carriage, and heard her order the coachman to drive to St.\nGermain.\n\nIt was useless to try to keep pace on foot with a carriage drawn by two\npowerful horses. D'Artagnan therefore returned to the Rue Ferou.\n\nIn the Rue de Seine he met Planchet, who had stopped before the house\nof a pastry cook, and was contemplating with ecstasy a cake of the most\nappetizing appearance.\n\nHe ordered him to go and saddle two horses in M. de Treville's\nstables--one for himself, d'Artagnan, and one for Planchet--and bring\nthem to Athens's place. Once for all, Treville had placed his stable at\nd'Artagnan's service.\n\nPlanchet proceeded toward the Rue du Colombier, and d'Artagnan toward\nthe Rue Ferou. Athos was at home, emptying sadly a bottle of the famous\nSpanish wine he had brought back with him from his journey into Picardy.\nHe made a sign for Grimaud to bring a glass for d'Artagnan, and Grimaud\nobeyed as usual.\n\nD'Artagnan related to Athos all that had passed at the church between\nPorthos and the procurator's wife, and how their comrade was probably by\nthat time in a fair way to be equipped.\n\n\"As for me,\" replied Athos to this recital, \"I am quite at my ease; it\nwill not be women that will defray the expense of my outfit.\"\n\n\"Handsome, well-bred, noble lord as you are, my dear Athos, neither\nprincesses nor queens would be secure from your amorous solicitations.\"\n\n\"How young this d'Artagnan is!\" said Athos, shrugging his shoulders; and\nhe made a sign to Grimaud to bring another bottle.\n\nAt that moment Planchet put his head modestly in at the half-open door,\nand told his master that the horses were ready.\n\n\"What horses?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"Two horses that Monsieur de Treville lends me at my pleasure, and with\nwhich I am now going to take a ride to St. Germain.\"\n\n\"Well, and what are you going to do at St. Germain?\" then demanded\nAthos.\n\nThen d'Artagnan described the meeting which he had at the church, and\nhow he had found that lady who, with the seigneur in the black cloak and\nwith the scar near his temple, filled his mind constantly.\n\n\"That is to say, you are in love with this lady as you were with Madame\nBonacieux,\" said Athos, shrugging his shoulders contemptuously, as if he\npitied human weakness.\n\n\"I? not at all!\" said d'Artagnan. \"I am only curious to unravel the\nmystery to which she is attached. I do not know why, but I imagine that\nthis woman, wholly unknown to me as she is, and wholly unknown to her as\nI am, has an influence over my life.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps you are right,\" said Athos. \"I do not know a woman that\nis worth the trouble of being sought for when she is once lost. Madame\nBonacieux is lost; so much the worse for her if she is found.\"\n\n\"No, Athos, no, you are mistaken,\" said d'Artagnan; \"I love my poor\nConstance more than ever, and if I knew the place in which she is, were\nit at the end of the world, I would go to free her from the hands of her\nenemies; but I am ignorant. All my researches have been useless. What is\nto be said? I must divert my attention!\"\n\n\"Amuse yourself with Milady, my dear d'Artagnan; I wish you may with all\nmy heart, if that will amuse you.\"\n\n\"Hear me, Athos,\" said d'Artagnan. \"Instead of shutting yourself up here\nas if you were under arrest, get on horseback and come and take a ride\nwith me to St. Germain.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" said Athos, \"I ride horses when I have any; when I\nhave none, I go afoot.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said d'Artagnan, smiling at the misanthropy of Athos, which from\nany other person would have offended him, \"I ride what I can get; I am\nnot so proud as you. So AU REVOIR, dear Athos.\"\n\n\"AU REVOIR,\" said the Musketeer, making a sign to Grimaud to uncork the\nbottle he had just brought.\n\nD'Artagnan and Planchet mounted, and took the road to St. Germain.\n\nAll along the road, what Athos had said respecting Mme. Bonacieux\nrecurred to the mind of the young man. Although d'Artagnan was not of\na very sentimental character, the mercer's pretty wife had made a real\nimpression upon his heart. As he said, he was ready to go to the end\nof the world to seek her; but the world, being round, has many ends, so\nthat he did not know which way to turn. Meantime, he was going to try\nto find out Milady. Milady had spoken to the man in the black cloak;\ntherefore she knew him. Now, in the opinion of d'Artagnan, it was\ncertainly the man in the black cloak who had carried off Mme. Bonacieux\nthe second time, as he had carried her off the first. d'Artagnan then\nonly half-lied, which is lying but little, when he said that by going in\nsearch of Milady he at the same time went in search of Constance.\n\nThinking of all this, and from time to time giving a touch of the spur\nto his horse, d'Artagnan completed his short journey, and arrived at\nSt. Germain. He had just passed by the pavilion in which ten years later\nLouis XIV was born. He rode up a very quiet street, looking to the\nright and the left to see if he could catch any vestige of his beautiful\nEnglishwoman, when from the ground floor of a pretty house, which,\naccording to the fashion of the time, had no window toward the street,\nhe saw a face peep out with which he thought he was acquainted. This\nperson walked along the terrace, which was ornamented with flowers.\nPlanchet recognized him first.\n\n\"Eh, monsieur!\" said he, addressing d'Artagnan, \"don't you remember that\nface which is blinking yonder?\"\n\n\"No,\" said d'Artagnan, \"and yet I am certain it is not the first time I\nhave seen that visage.\"\n\n\"PARBLEU, I believe it is not,\" said Planchet. \"Why, it is poor Lubin,\nthe lackey of the Comte de Wardes--he whom you took such good care of a\nmonth ago at Calais, on the road to the governor's country house!\"\n\n\"So it is!\" said d'Artagnan; \"I know him now. Do you think he would\nrecollect you?\"\n\n\"My faith, monsieur, he was in such trouble that I doubt if he can have\nretained a very clear recollection of me.\"\n\n\"Well, go and talk with the boy,\" said d'Artagnan, \"and make out if you\ncan from his conversation whether his master is dead.\"\n\nPlanchet dismounted and went straight up to Lubin, who did not at\nall remember him, and the two lackeys began to chat with the best\nunderstanding possible; while d'Artagnan turned the two horses into a\nlane, went round the house, and came back to watch the conference from\nbehind a hedge of filberts.\n\nAt the end of an instant's observation he heard the noise of a vehicle,\nand saw Milady's carriage stop opposite to him. He could not be\nmistaken; Milady was in it. D'Artagnan leaned upon the neck of his\nhorse, in order that he might see without being seen.\n\nMilady put her charming blond head out at the window, and gave her\norders to her maid.\n\nThe latter--a pretty girl of about twenty or twenty-two years, active\nand lively, the true SOUBRETTE of a great lady--jumped from the step\nupon which, according to the custom of the time, she was seated, and\ntook her way toward the terrace upon which d'Artagnan had perceived\nLubin.\n\nD'Artagnan followed the soubrette with his eyes, and saw her go toward\nthe terrace; but it happened that someone in the house called Lubin,\nso that Planchet remained alone, looking in all directions for the road\nwhere d'Artagnan had disappeared.\n\nThe maid approached Planchet, whom she took for Lubin, and holding out a\nlittle billet to him said, \"For your master.\"\n\n\"For my master?\" replied Planchet, astonished.\n\n\"Yes, and important. Take it quickly.\"\n\nThereupon she ran toward the carriage, which had turned round toward the\nway it came, jumped upon the step, and the carriage drove off.\n\nPlanchet turned and returned the billet. Then, accustomed to passive\nobedience, he jumped down from the terrace, ran toward the lane, and at\nthe end of twenty paces met d'Artagnan, who, having seen all, was coming\nto him.\n\n\"For you, monsieur,\" said Planchet, presenting the billet to the young\nman.\n\n\"For me?\" said d'Artagnan; \"are you sure of that?\"\n\n\"PARDIEU, monsieur, I can't be more sure. The SOUBRETTE said, 'For your\nmaster.' I have no other master but you; so--a pretty little lass, my\nfaith, is that SOUBRETTE!\"\n\nD'Artagnan opened the letter, and read these words:\n\n\n\"A person who takes more interest in you than she is willing to confess\nwishes to know on what day it will suit you to walk in the forest?\nTomorrow, at the Hotel Field of the Cloth of Gold, a lackey in black and\nred will wait for your reply.\"\n\n\n\"Oh!\" said d'Artagnan, \"this is rather warm; it appears that Milady and\nI are anxious about the health of the same person. Well, Planchet, how\nis the good Monsieur de Wardes? He is not dead, then?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur, he is as well as a man can be with four sword wounds\nin his body; for you, without question, inflicted four upon the dear\ngentleman, and he is still very weak, having lost almost all his blood.\nAs I said, monsieur, Lubin did not know me, and told me our adventure\nfrom one end to the other.\"\n\n\"Well done, Planchet! you are the king of lackeys. Now jump onto your\nhorse, and let us overtake the carriage.\"\n\nThis did not take long. At the end of five minutes they perceived the\ncarriage drawn up by the roadside; a cavalier, richly dressed, was close\nto the door.\n\nThe conversation between Milady and the cavalier was so animated that\nd'Artagnan stopped on the other side of the carriage without anyone but\nthe pretty SOUBRETTE perceiving his presence.\n\nThe conversation took place in English--a language which d'Artagnan\ncould not understand; but by the accent the young man plainly saw that\nthe beautiful Englishwoman was in a great rage. She terminated it by an\naction which left no doubt as to the nature of this conversation;\nthis was a blow with her fan, applied with such force that the little\nfeminine weapon flew into a thousand pieces.\n\nThe cavalier laughed aloud, which appeared to exasperate Milady still\nmore.\n\nD'Artagnan thought this was the moment to interfere. He approached the\nother door, and taking off his hat respectfully, said, \"Madame, will you\npermit me to offer you my services? It appears to me that this cavalier\nhas made you very angry. Speak one word, madame, and I take upon myself\nto punish him for his want of courtesy.\"\n\nAt the first word Milady turned, looking at the young man with\nastonishment; and when he had finished, she said in very good French,\n\"Monsieur, I should with great confidence place myself under your\nprotection if the person with whom I quarrel were not my brother.\"\n\n\"Ah, excuse me, then,\" said d'Artagnan. \"You must be aware that I was\nignorant of that, madame.\"\n\n\"What is that stupid fellow troubling himself about?\" cried the cavalier\nwhom Milady had designated as her brother, stooping down to the height\nof the coach window. \"Why does not he go about his business?\"\n\n\"Stupid fellow yourself!\" said d'Artagnan, stooping in his turn on\nthe neck of his horse, and answering on his side through the carriage\nwindow. \"I do not go on because it pleases me to stop here.\"\n\nThe cavalier addressed some words in English to his sister.\n\n\"I speak to you in French,\" said d'Artagnan; \"be kind enough, then, to\nreply to me in the same language. You are Madame's brother, I learn--be\nit so; but fortunately you are not mine.\"\n\nIt might be thought that Milady, timid as women are in general, would\nhave interposed in this commencement of mutual provocations in order to\nprevent the quarrel from going too far; but on the contrary, she threw\nherself back in her carriage, and called out coolly to the coachman, \"Go\non--home!\"\n\nThe pretty SOUBRETTE cast an anxious glance at d'Artagnan, whose good\nlooks seemed to have made an impression on her.\n\nThe carriage went on, and left the two men facing each other; no\nmaterial obstacle separated them.\n\nThe cavalier made a movement as if to follow the carriage; but\nd'Artagnan, whose anger, already excited, was much increased by\nrecognizing in him the Englishman of Amiens who had won his horse and\nhad been very near winning his diamond of Athos, caught at his bridle\nand stopped him.\n\n\"Well, monsieur,\" said he, \"you appear to be more stupid than I am, for\nyou forget there is a little quarrel to arrange between us two.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the Englishman, \"is it you, my master? It seems you must\nalways be playing some game or other.\"\n\n\"Yes; and that reminds me that I have a revenge to take. We will see, my\ndear monsieur, if you can handle a sword as skillfully as you can a dice\nbox.\"\n\n\"You see plainly that I have no sword,\" said the Englishman. \"Do you\nwish to play the braggart with an unarmed man?\"\n\n\"I hope you have a sword at home; but at all events, I have two, and if\nyou like, I will throw with you for one of them.\"\n\n\"Needless,\" said the Englishman; \"I am well furnished with such\nplaythings.\"\n\n\"Very well, my worthy gentleman,\" replied d'Artagnan, \"pick out the\nlongest, and come and show it to me this evening.\"\n\n\"Where, if you please?\"\n\n\"Behind the Luxembourg; that's a charming spot for such amusements as\nthe one I propose to you.\"\n\n\"That will do; I will be there.\"\n\n\"Your hour?\"\n\n\"Six o'clock.\"\n\n\"A PROPOS, you have probably one or two friends?\"\n\n\"I have three, who would be honored by joining in the sport with me.\"\n\n\"Three? Marvelous! That falls out oddly! Three is just my number!\"\n\n\"Now, then, who are you?\" asked the Englishman.\n\n\"I am Monsieur d'Artagnan, a Gascon gentleman, serving in the king's\nMusketeers. And you?\"\n\n\"I am Lord de Winter, Baron Sheffield.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I am your servant, Monsieur Baron,\" said d'Artagnan,\n\"though you have names rather difficult to recollect.\" And touching his\nhorse with the spur, he cantered back to Paris. As he was accustomed\nto do in all cases of any consequence, d'Artagnan went straight to the\nresidence of Athos.\n\nHe found Athos reclining upon a large sofa, where he was waiting, as he\nsaid, for his outfit to come and find him. He related to Athos all that\nhad passed, except the letter to M. de Wardes.\n\nAthos was delighted to find he was going to fight an Englishman. We\nmight say that was his dream.\n\nThey immediately sent their lackeys for Porthos and Aramis, and on their\narrival made them acquainted with the situation.\n\nPorthos drew his sword from the scabbard, and made passes at the wall,\nspringing back from time to time, and making contortions like a dancer.\n\nAramis, who was constantly at work at his poem, shut himself up in\nAthos's closet, and begged not to be disturbed before the moment of\ndrawing swords.\n\nAthos, by signs, desired Grimaud to bring another bottle of wine.\n\nD'Artagnan employed himself in arranging a little plan, of which we\nshall hereafter see the execution, and which promised him some agreeable\nadventure, as might be seen by the smiles which from time to time passed\nover his countenance, whose thoughtfulness they animated.\n\n\n\n\n\n31 ENGLISH AND FRENCH\n\nThe hour having come, they went with their four lackeys to a spot behind\nthe Luxembourg given up to the feeding of goats. Athos threw a piece of\nmoney to the goatkeeper to withdraw. The lackeys were ordered to act as\nsentinels.\n\nA silent party soon drew near to the same enclosure, entered, and joined\nthe Musketeers. Then, according to foreign custom, the presentations\ntook place.\n\nThe Englishmen were all men of rank; consequently the odd names of\ntheir adversaries were for them not only a matter of surprise, but of\nannoyance.\n\n\"But after all,\" said Lord de Winter, when the three friends had been\nnamed, \"we do not know who you are. We cannot fight with such names;\nthey are names of shepherds.\"\n\n\"Therefore your lordship may suppose they are only assumed names,\" said\nAthos.\n\n\"Which only gives us a greater desire to know the real ones,\" replied\nthe Englishman.\n\n\"You played very willingly with us without knowing our names,\" said\nAthos, \"by the same token that you won our horses.\"\n\n\"That is true, but we then only risked our pistoles; this time we risk\nour blood. One plays with anybody; but one fights only with equals.\"\n\n\"And that is but just,\" said Athos, and he took aside the one of the\nfour Englishmen with whom he was to fight, and communicated his name in\na low voice.\n\nPorthos and Aramis did the same.\n\n\"Does that satisfy you?\" said Athos to his adversary. \"Do you find me of\nsufficient rank to do me the honor of crossing swords with me?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" said the Englishman, bowing.\n\n\"Well! now shall I tell you something?\" added Athos, coolly.\n\n\"What?\" replied the Englishman.\n\n\"Why, that is that you would have acted much more wisely if you had not\nrequired me to make myself known.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because I am believed to be dead, and have reasons for wishing nobody\nto know I am living; so that I shall be obliged to kill you to prevent\nmy secret from roaming over the fields.\"\n\nThe Englishman looked at Athos, believing that he jested, but Athos did\nnot jest the least in the world.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Athos, addressing at the same time his companions and\ntheir adversaries, \"are we ready?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" answered the Englishmen and the Frenchmen, as with one voice.\n\n\"On guard, then!\" cried Athos.\n\nImmediately eight swords glittered in the rays of the setting sun,\nand the combat began with an animosity very natural between men twice\nenemies.\n\nAthos fenced with as much calmness and method as if he had been\npracticing in a fencing school.\n\nPorthos, abated, no doubt, of his too-great confidence by his adventure\nof Chantilly, played with skill and prudence. Aramis, who had the third\ncanto of his poem to finish, behaved like a man in haste.\n\nAthos killed his adversary first. He hit him but once, but as he had\nforetold, that hit was a mortal one; the sword pierced his heart.\n\nSecond, Porthos stretched his upon the grass with a wound through his\nthigh, As the Englishman, without making any further resistance, then\nsurrendered his sword, Porthos took him up in his arms and bore him to\nhis carriage.\n\nAramis pushed his so vigorously that after going back fifty paces,\nthe man ended by fairly taking to his heels, and disappeared amid the\nhooting of the lackeys.\n\nAs to d'Artagnan, he fought purely and simply on the defensive; and when\nhe saw his adversary pretty well fatigued, with a vigorous side thrust\nsent his sword flying. The baron, finding himself disarmed, took two\nor three steps back, but in this movement his foot slipped and he fell\nbackward.\n\nD'Artagnan was over him at a bound, and said to the Englishman, pointing\nhis sword to his throat, \"I could kill you, my Lord, you are completely\nin my hands; but I spare your life for the sake of your sister.\"\n\nD'Artagnan was at the height of joy; he had realized the plan he had\nimagined beforehand, whose picturing had produced the smiles we noted\nupon his face.\n\nThe Englishman, delighted at having to do with a gentleman of such a\nkind disposition, pressed d'Artagnan in his arms, and paid a thousand\ncompliments to the three Musketeers, and as Porthos's adversary was\nalready installed in the carriage, and as Aramis's had taken to his\nheels, they had nothing to think about but the dead.\n\nAs Porthos and Aramis were undressing him, in the hope of finding his\nwound not mortal, a large purse dropped from his clothes. D'Artagnan\npicked it up and offered it to Lord de Winter.\n\n\"What the devil would you have me do with that?\" said the Englishman.\n\n\"You can restore it to his family,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"His family will care much about such a trifle as that! His family will\ninherit fifteen thousand louis a year from him. Keep the purse for your\nlackeys.\"\n\nD'Artagnan put the purse into his pocket.\n\n\"And now, my young friend, for you will permit me, I hope, to give you\nthat name,\" said Lord de Winter, \"on this very evening, if agreeable to\nyou, I will present you to my sister, Milady Clarik, for I am desirous\nthat she should take you into her good graces; and as she is not in bad\nodor at court, she may perhaps on some future day speak a word that will\nnot prove useless to you.\"\n\nD'Artagnan blushed with pleasure, and bowed a sign of assent.\n\nAt this time Athos came up to d'Artagnan.\n\n\"What do you mean to do with that purse?\" whispered he.\n\n\"Why, I meant to pass it over to you, my dear Athos.\"\n\n\"Me! why to me?\"\n\n\"Why, you killed him! They are the spoils of victory.\"\n\n\"I, the heir of an enemy!\" said Athos; \"for whom, then, do you take me?\"\n\n\"It is the custom in war,\" said d'Artagnan, \"why should it not be the\ncustom in a duel?\"\n\n\"Even on the field of battle, I have never done that.\"\n\nPorthos shrugged his shoulders; Aramis by a movement of his lips\nendorsed Athos.\n\n\"Then,\" said d'Artagnan, \"let us give the money to the lackeys, as Lord\nde Winter desired us to do.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Athos; \"let us give the money to the lackeys--not to our\nlackeys, but to the lackeys of the Englishmen.\"\n\nAthos took the purse, and threw it into the hand of the coachman. \"For\nyou and your comrades.\"\n\nThis greatness of spirit in a man who was quite destitute struck even\nPorthos; and this French generosity, repeated by Lord de Winter and his\nfriend, was highly applauded, except by MM. Grimaud, Bazin, Mousqueton\nand Planchet.\n\nLord de Winter, on quitting d'Artagnan, gave him his sister's address.\nShe lived in the Place Royale--then the fashionable quarter--at Number\n6, and he undertook to call and take d'Artagnan with him in order to\nintroduce him. d'Artagnan appointed eight o'clock at Athos's residence.\n\nThis introduction to Milady Clarik occupied the head of our Gascon\ngreatly. He remembered in what a strange manner this woman had hitherto\nbeen mixed up in his destiny. According to his conviction, she was\nsome creature of the cardinal, and yet he felt himself invincibly drawn\ntoward her by one of those sentiments for which we cannot account. His\nonly fear was that Milady would recognize in him the man of Meung and of\nDover. Then she knew that he was one of the friends of M. de Treville,\nand consequently, that he belonged body and soul to the king; which\nwould make him lose a part of his advantage, since when known to\nMilady as he knew her, he played only an equal game with her. As to\nthe commencement of an intrigue between her and M. de Wardes, our\npresumptuous hero gave but little heed to that, although the marquis was\nyoung, handsome, rich, and high in the cardinal's favor. It is not\nfor nothing we are but twenty years old, above all if we were born at\nTarbes.\n\nD'Artagnan began by making his most splendid toilet, then returned\nto Athos's, and according to custom, related everything to him. Athos\nlistened to his projects, then shook his head, and recommended prudence\nto him with a shade of bitterness.\n\n\"What!\" said he, \"you have just lost one woman, whom you call good,\ncharming, perfect; and here you are, running headlong after another.\"\n\nD'Artagnan felt the truth of this reproach.\n\n\"I loved Madame Bonacieux with my heart, while I only love Milady with\nmy head,\" said he. \"In getting introduced to her, my principal object is\nto ascertain what part she plays at court.\"\n\n\"The part she plays, PARDIEU! It is not difficult to divine that, after\nall you have told me. She is some emissary of the cardinal; a woman who\nwill draw you into a snare in which you will leave your head.\"\n\n\"The devil! my dear Athos, you view things on the dark side, methinks.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, I mistrust women. Can it be otherwise? I bought my\nexperience dearly--particularly fair women. Milady is fair, you say?\"\n\n\"She has the most beautiful light hair imaginable!\"\n\n\"Ah, my poor d'Artagnan!\" said Athos.\n\n\"Listen to me! I want to be enlightened on a subject; then, when I shall\nhave learned what I desire to know, I will withdraw.\"\n\n\"Be enlightened!\" said Athos, phlegmatically.\n\nLord de Winter arrived at the appointed time; but Athos, being warned of\nhis coming, went into the other chamber. He therefore found d'Artagnan\nalone, and as it was nearly eight o'clock he took the young man with\nhim.\n\nAn elegant carriage waited below, and as it was drawn by two excellent\nhorses, they were soon at the Place Royale.\n\nMilady Clarik received d'Artagnan ceremoniously. Her hotel was\nremarkably sumptuous, and while the most part of the English had quit,\nor were about to quit, France on account of the war, Milady had just\nbeen laying out much money upon her residence; which proved that the\ngeneral measure which drove the English from France did not affect her.\n\n\"You see,\" said Lord de Winter, presenting d'Artagnan to his sister,\n\"a young gentleman who has held my life in his hands, and who has not\nabused his advantage, although we have been twice enemies, although\nit was I who insulted him, and although I am an Englishman. Thank him,\nthen, madame, if you have any affection for me.\"\n\nMilady frowned slightly; a scarcely visible cloud passed over her brow,\nand so peculiar a smile appeared upon her lips that the young man, who\nsaw and observed this triple shade, almost shuddered at it.\n\nThe brother did not perceive this; he had turned round to play with\nMilady's favorite monkey, which had pulled him by the doublet.\n\n\"You are welcome, monsieur,\" said Milady, in a voice whose singular\nsweetness contrasted with the symptoms of ill-humor which d'Artagnan had\njust remarked; \"you have today acquired eternal rights to my gratitude.\"\n\nThe Englishman then turned round and described the combat without\nomitting a single detail. Milady listened with the greatest attention,\nand yet it was easily to be perceived, whatever effort she made to\nconceal her impressions, that this recital was not agreeable to her.\nThe blood rose to her head, and her little foot worked with impatience\nbeneath her robe.\n\nLord de Winter perceived nothing of this. When he had finished, he went\nto a table upon which was a salver with Spanish wine and glasses. He\nfilled two glasses, and by a sign invited d'Artagnan to drink.\n\nD'Artagnan knew it was considered disobliging by an Englishman to refuse\nto pledge him. He therefore drew near to the table and took the second\nglass. He did not, however, lose sight of Milady, and in a mirror he\nperceived the change that came over her face. Now that she believed\nherself to be no longer observed, a sentiment resembling ferocity\nanimated her countenance. She bit her handkerchief with her beautiful\nteeth.\n\nThat pretty little SOUBRETTE whom d'Artagnan had already observed\nthen came in. She spoke some words to Lord de Winter in English, who\nthereupon requested d'Artagnan's permission to retire, excusing himself\non account of the urgency of the business that had called him away, and\ncharging his sister to obtain his pardon.\n\nD'Artagnan exchanged a shake of the hand with Lord de Winter, and then\nreturned to Milady. Her countenance, with surprising mobility, had\nrecovered its gracious expression; but some little red spots on her\nhandkerchief indicated that she had bitten her lips till the blood came.\nThose lips were magnificent; they might be said to be of coral.\n\nThe conversation took a cheerful turn. Milady appeared to have\nentirely recovered. She told d'Artagnan that Lord de Winter was her\nbrother-in-law, and not her brother. She had married a younger brother\nof the family, who had left her a widow with one child. This child was\nthe only heir to Lord de Winter, if Lord de Winter did not marry. All\nthis showed d'Artagnan that there was a veil which concealed something;\nbut he could not yet see under this veil.\n\nIn addition to this, after a half hour's conversation d'Artagnan was\nconvinced that Milady was his compatriot; she spoke French with an\nelegance and a purity that left no doubt on that head.\n\nD'Artagnan was profuse in gallant speeches and protestations of\ndevotion. To all the simple things which escaped our Gascon, Milady\nreplied with a smile of kindness. The hour came for him to retire.\nD'Artagnan took leave of Milady, and left the saloon the happiest of\nmen.\n\nOn the staircase he met the pretty SOUBRETTE, who brushed gently against\nhim as she passed, and then, blushing to the eyes, asked his pardon\nfor having touched him in a voice so sweet that the pardon was granted\ninstantly.\n\nD'Artagnan came again on the morrow, and was still better received than\non the evening before. Lord de Winter was not at home; and it was Milady\nwho this time did all the honors of the evening. She appeared to take a\ngreat interest in him, asked him whence he came, who were his friends,\nand whether he had not sometimes thought of attaching himself to the\ncardinal.\n\nD'Artagnan, who, as we have said, was exceedingly prudent for a young\nman of twenty, then remembered his suspicions regarding Milady. He\nlaunched into a eulogy of his Eminence, and said that he should not have\nfailed to enter into the Guards of the cardinal instead of the king's\nGuards if he had happened to know M. de Cavois instead of M. de\nTreville.\n\nMilady changed the conversation without any appearance of affectation,\nand asked d'Artagnan in the most careless manner possible if he had ever\nbeen in England.\n\nD'Artagnan replied that he had been sent thither by M. de Treville\nto treat for a supply of horses, and that he had brought back four as\nspecimens.\n\nMilady in the course of the conversation twice or thrice bit her lips;\nshe had to deal with a Gascon who played close.\n\nAt the same hour as on the preceding evening, d'Artagnan retired. In\nthe corridor he again met the pretty Kitty; that was the name of the\nSOUBRETTE. She looked at him with an expression of kindness which it was\nimpossible to mistake; but d'Artagnan was so preoccupied by the mistress\nthat he noticed absolutely nothing but her.\n\nD'Artagnan came again on the morrow and the day after that, and each day\nMilady gave him a more gracious reception.\n\nEvery evening, either in the antechamber, the corridor, or on the\nstairs, he met the pretty SOUBRETTE. But, as we have said, d'Artagnan\npaid no attention to this persistence of poor Kitty.\n\n\n\n\n32 A PROCURATOR'S DINNER\n\nHowever brilliant had been the part played by Porthos in the duel, it\nhad not made him forget the dinner of the procurator's wife.\n\nOn the morrow he received the last touches of Mousqueton's brush for an\nhour, and took his way toward the Rue aux Ours with the steps of a man\nwho was doubly in favor with fortune.\n\nHis heart beat, but not like d'Artagnan's with a young and impatient\nlove. No; a more material interest stirred his blood. He was about at\nlast to pass that mysterious threshold, to climb those unknown stairs by\nwhich, one by one, the old crowns of M. Coquenard had ascended. He was\nabout to see in reality a certain coffer of which he had twenty times\nbeheld the image in his dreams--a coffer long and deep, locked, bolted,\nfastened in the wall; a coffer of which he had so often heard, and\nwhich the hands--a little wrinkled, it is true, but still not without\nelegance--of the procurator's wife were about to open to his admiring\nlooks.\n\nAnd then he--a wanderer on the earth, a man without fortune, a man\nwithout family, a soldier accustomed to inns, cabarets, taverns, and\nrestaurants, a lover of wine forced to depend upon chance treats--was\nabout to partake of family meals, to enjoy the pleasures of a\ncomfortable establishment, and to give himself up to those little\nattentions which \"the harder one is, the more they please,\" as old\nsoldiers say.\n\nTo come in the capacity of a cousin, and seat himself every day at a\ngood table; to smooth the yellow, wrinkled brow of the old procurator;\nto pluck the clerks a little by teaching them BASSETTE, PASSE-DIX, and\nLANSQUENET, in their utmost nicety, and winning from them, by way of\nfee for the lesson he would give them in an hour, their savings of a\nmonth--all this was enormously delightful to Porthos.\n\nThe Musketeer could not forget the evil reports which then prevailed,\nand which indeed have survived them, of the procurators of the\nperiod--meanness, stinginess, fasts; but as, after all, excepting some\nfew acts of economy which Porthos had always found very unseasonable,\nthe procurator's wife had been tolerably liberal--that is, be it\nunderstood, for a procurator's wife--he hoped to see a household of a\nhighly comfortable kind.\n\nAnd yet, at the very door the Musketeer began to entertain some doubts.\nThe approach was not such as to prepossess people--an ill-smelling, dark\npassage, a staircase half-lighted by bars through which stole a glimmer\nfrom a neighboring yard; on the first floor a low door studded with\nenormous nails, like the principal gate of the Grand Chatelet.\n\nPorthos knocked with his hand. A tall, pale clerk, his face shaded by a\nforest of virgin hair, opened the door, and bowed with the air of a\nman forced at once to respect in another lofty stature, which indicated\nstrength, the military dress, which indicated rank, and a ruddy\ncountenance, which indicated familiarity with good living.\n\nA shorter clerk came behind the first, a taller clerk behind the second,\na stripling of a dozen years rising behind the third. In all, three\nclerks and a half, which, for the time, argued a very extensive\nclientage.\n\nAlthough the Musketeer was not expected before one o'clock, the\nprocurator's wife had been on the watch ever since midday, reckoning\nthat the heart, or perhaps the stomach, of her lover would bring him\nbefore his time.\n\nMme. Coquenard therefore entered the office from the house at the same\nmoment her guest entered from the stairs, and the appearance of the\nworthy lady relieved him from an awkward embarrassment. The clerks\nsurveyed him with great curiosity, and he, not knowing well what to say\nto this ascending and descending scale, remained tongue-tied.\n\n\"It is my cousin!\" cried the procurator's wife. \"Come in, come in,\nMonsieur Porthos!\"\n\nThe name of Porthos produced its effect upon the clerks, who began to\nlaugh; but Porthos turned sharply round, and every countenance quickly\nrecovered its gravity.\n\nThey reached the office of the procurator after having passed through\nthe antechamber in which the clerks were, and the study in which\nthey ought to have been. This last apartment was a sort of dark room,\nlittered with papers. On quitting the study they left the kitchen on the\nright, and entered the reception room.\n\nAll these rooms, which communicated with one another, did not inspire\nPorthos favorably. Words might be heard at a distance through all these\nopen doors. Then, while passing, he had cast a rapid, investigating\nglance into the kitchen; and he was obliged to confess to himself, to\nthe shame of the procurator's wife and his own regret, that he did not\nsee that fire, that animation, that bustle, which when a good repast is\non foot prevails generally in that sanctuary of good living.\n\nThe procurator had without doubt been warned of his visit, as he\nexpressed no surprise at the sight of Porthos, who advanced toward him\nwith a sufficiently easy air, and saluted him courteously.\n\n\"We are cousins, it appears, Monsieur Porthos?\" said the procurator,\nrising, yet supporting his weight upon the arms of his cane chair.\n\nThe old man, wrapped in a large black doublet, in which the whole of\nhis slender body was concealed, was brisk and dry. His little gray eyes\nshone like carbuncles, and appeared, with his grinning mouth, to be the\nonly part of his face in which life survived. Unfortunately the legs\nbegan to refuse their service to this bony machine. During the last five\nor six months that this weakness had been felt, the worthy procurator\nhad nearly become the slave of his wife.\n\nThe cousin was received with resignation, that was all. M. Coquenard,\nfirm upon his legs, would have declined all relationship with M.\nPorthos.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, we are cousins,\" said Porthos, without being\ndisconcerted, as he had never reckoned upon being received\nenthusiastically by the husband.\n\n\"By the female side, I believe?\" said the procurator, maliciously.\n\nPorthos did not feel the ridicule of this, and took it for a piece of\nsimplicity, at which he laughed in his large mustache. Mme. Coquenard,\nwho knew that a simple-minded procurator was a very rare variety in the\nspecies, smiled a little, and colored a great deal.\n\nM. Coquenard had, since the arrival of Porthos, frequently cast his\neyes with great uneasiness upon a large chest placed in front of his\noak desk. Porthos comprehended that this chest, although it did not\ncorrespond in shape with that which he had seen in his dreams, must be\nthe blessed coffer, and he congratulated himself that the reality was\nseveral feet higher than the dream.\n\nM. Coquenard did not carry his genealogical investigations any further;\nbut withdrawing his anxious look from the chest and fixing it upon\nPorthos, he contented himself with saying, \"Monsieur our cousin will\ndo us the favor of dining with us once before his departure for the\ncampaign, will he not, Madame Coquenard?\"\n\nThis time Porthos received the blow right in his stomach, and felt it.\nIt appeared likewise that Mme. Coquenard was not less affected by it on\nher part, for she added, \"My cousin will not return if he finds that we\ndo not treat him kindly; but otherwise he has so little time to pass in\nParis, and consequently to spare to us, that we must entreat him to give\nus every instant he can call his own previous to his departure.\"\n\n\"Oh, my legs, my poor legs! where are you?\" murmured Coquenard, and he\ntried to smile.\n\nThis succor, which came to Porthos at the moment in which he was\nattacked in his gastronomic hopes, inspired much gratitude in the\nMusketeer toward the procurator's wife.\n\nThe hour of dinner soon arrived. They passed into the eating room--a\nlarge dark room situated opposite the kitchen.\n\nThe clerks, who, as it appeared, had smelled unusual perfumes in the\nhouse, were of military punctuality, and held their stools in hand\nquite ready to sit down. Their jaws moved preliminarily with fearful\nthreatenings.\n\n\"Indeed!\" thought Porthos, casting a glance at the three hungry\nclerks--for the errand boy, as might be expected, was not admitted to\nthe honors of the magisterial table, \"in my cousin's place, I would not\nkeep such gourmands! They look like shipwrecked sailors who have not\neaten for six weeks.\"\n\nM. Coquenard entered, pushed along upon his armchair with casters by\nMme. Coquenard, whom Porthos assisted in rolling her husband up to the\ntable. He had scarcely entered when he began to agitate his nose and his\njaws after the example of his clerks.\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" said he; \"here is a soup which is rather inviting.\"\n\n\"What the devil can they smell so extraordinary in this soup?\" said\nPorthos, at the sight of a pale liquid, abundant but entirely free from\nmeat, on the surface of which a few crusts swam about as rare as the\nislands of an archipelago.\n\nMme. Coquenard smiled, and upon a sign from her everyone eagerly took\nhis seat.\n\nM. Coquenard was served first, then Porthos. Afterward Mme. Coquenard\nfilled her own plate, and distributed the crusts without soup to the\nimpatient clerks. At this moment the door of the dining room unclosed\nwith a creak, and Porthos perceived through the half-open flap the\nlittle clerk who, not being allowed to take part in the feast, ate his\ndry bread in the passage with the double odor of the dining room and\nkitchen.\n\nAfter the soup the maid brought a boiled fowl--a piece of magnificence\nwhich caused the eyes of the diners to dilate in such a manner that they\nseemed ready to burst.\n\n\"One may see that you love your family, Madame Coquenard,\" said the\nprocurator, with a smile that was almost tragic. \"You are certainly\ntreating your cousin very handsomely!\"\n\nThe poor fowl was thin, and covered with one of those thick, bristly\nskins through which the teeth cannot penetrate with all their efforts.\nThe fowl must have been sought for a long time on the perch, to which it\nhad retired to die of old age.\n\n\"The devil!\" thought Porthos, \"this is poor work. I respect old age, but\nI don't much like it boiled or roasted.\"\n\nAnd he looked round to see if anybody partook of his opinion; but on\nthe contrary, he saw nothing but eager eyes which were devouring, in\nanticipation, that sublime fowl which was the object of his contempt.\n\nMme. Coquenard drew the dish toward her, skillfully detached the two\ngreat black feet, which she placed upon her husband's plate, cut off the\nneck, which with the head she put on one side for herself, raised the\nwing for Porthos, and then returned the bird otherwise intact to the\nservant who had brought it in, who disappeared with it before the\nMusketeer had time to examine the variations which disappointment\nproduces upon faces, according to the characters and temperaments of\nthose who experience it.\n\nIn the place of the fowl a dish of haricot beans made its appearance--an\nenormous dish in which some bones of mutton that at first sight\none might have believed to have some meat on them pretended to show\nthemselves.\n\nBut the clerks were not the dupes of this deceit, and their lugubrious\nlooks settled down into resigned countenances.\n\nMme. Coquenard distributed this dish to the young men with the\nmoderation of a good housewife.\n\nThe time for wine came. M. Coquenard poured from a very small stone\nbottle the third of a glass for each of the young men, served himself\nin about the same proportion, and passed the bottle to Porthos and Mme.\nCoquenard.\n\nThe young men filled up their third of a glass with water; then, when\nthey had drunk half the glass, they filled it up again, and continued\nto do so. This brought them, by the end of the repast, to swallowing\na drink which from the color of the ruby had passed to that of a pale\ntopaz.\n\nPorthos ate his wing of the fowl timidly, and shuddered when he felt the\nknee of the procurator's wife under the table, as it came in search of\nhis. He also drank half a glass of this sparingly served wine, and found\nit to be nothing but that horrible Montreuil--the terror of all expert\npalates.\n\nM. Coquenard saw him swallowing this wine undiluted, and sighed deeply.\n\n\"Will you eat any of these beans, Cousin Porthos?\" said Mme. Coquenard,\nin that tone which says, \"Take my advice, don't touch them.\"\n\n\"Devil take me if I taste one of them!\" murmured Porthos to himself, and\nthen said aloud, \"Thank you, my cousin, I am no longer hungry.\"\n\nThere was silence. Porthos could hardly keep his countenance.\n\nThe procurator repeated several times, \"Ah, Madame Coquenard! Accept my\ncompliments; your dinner has been a real feast. Lord, how I have eaten!\"\n\nM. Coquenard had eaten his soup, the black feet of the fowl, and the\nonly mutton bone on which there was the least appearance of meat.\n\nPorthos fancied they were mystifying him, and began to curl his mustache\nand knit his eyebrows; but the knee of Mme. Coquenard gently advised him\nto be patient.\n\nThis silence and this interruption in serving, which were unintelligible\nto Porthos, had, on the contrary, a terrible meaning for the clerks.\nUpon a look from the procurator, accompanied by a smile from Mme.\nCoquenard, they arose slowly from the table, folded their napkins more\nslowly still, bowed, and retired.\n\n\"Go, young men! go and promote digestion by working,\" said the\nprocurator, gravely.\n\nThe clerks gone, Mme. Coquenard rose and took from a buffet a piece of\ncheese, some preserved quinces, and a cake which she had herself made of\nalmonds and honey.\n\nM. Coquenard knit his eyebrows because there were too many good things.\nPorthos bit his lips because he saw not the wherewithal to dine. He\nlooked to see if the dish of beans was still there; the dish of beans\nhad disappeared.\n\n\"A positive feast!\" cried M. Coquenard, turning about in his chair, \"a\nreal feast, EPULCE EPULORUM. Lucullus dines with Lucullus.\"\n\nPorthos looked at the bottle, which was near him, and hoped that with\nwine, bread, and cheese, he might make a dinner; but wine was wanting,\nthe bottle was empty. M. and Mme. Coquenard did not seem to observe it.\n\n\"This is fine!\" said Porthos to himself; \"I am prettily caught!\"\n\nHe passed his tongue over a spoonful of preserves, and stuck his teeth\ninto the sticky pastry of Mme. Coquenard.\n\n\"Now,\" said he, \"the sacrifice is consummated! Ah! if I had not the hope\nof peeping with Madame Coquenard into her husband's chest!\"\n\nM. Coquenard, after the luxuries of such a repast, which he called an\nexcess, felt the want of a siesta. Porthos began to hope that the thing\nwould take place at the present sitting, and in that same locality; but\nthe procurator would listen to nothing, he would be taken to his room,\nand was not satisfied till he was close to his chest, upon the edge of\nwhich, for still greater precaution, he placed his feet.\n\nThe procurator's wife took Porthos into an adjoining room, and they\nbegan to lay the basis of a reconciliation.\n\n\"You can come and dine three times a week,\" said Mme. Coquenard.\n\n\"Thanks, madame!\" said Porthos, \"but I don't like to abuse your\nkindness; besides, I must think of my outfit!\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said the procurator's wife, groaning, \"that unfortunate\noutfit!\"\n\n\"Alas, yes,\" said Porthos, \"it is so.\"\n\n\"But of what, then, does the equipment of your company consist, Monsieur\nPorthos?\"\n\n\"Oh, of many things!\" said Porthos. \"The Musketeers are, as you know,\npicked soldiers, and they require many things useless to the Guardsmen\nor the Swiss.\"\n\n\"But yet, detail them to me.\"\n\n\"Why, they may amount to--\", said Porthos, who preferred discussing the\ntotal to taking them one by one.\n\nThe procurator's wife waited tremblingly.\n\n\"To how much?\" said she. \"I hope it does not exceed--\" She stopped;\nspeech failed her.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Porthos, \"it does not exceed two thousand five hundred\nlivres! I even think that with economy I could manage it with two\nthousand livres.\"\n\n\"Good God!\" cried she, \"two thousand livres! Why, that is a fortune!\"\n\nPorthos made a most significant grimace; Mme. Coquenard understood it.\n\n\"I wished to know the detail,\" said she, \"because, having many relatives\nin business, I was almost sure of obtaining things at a hundred per cent\nless than you would pay yourself.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" said Porthos, \"that is what you meant to say!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear Monsieur Porthos. Thus, for instance, don't you in the first\nplace want a horse?\"\n\n\"Yes, a horse.\"\n\n\"Well, then! I can just suit you.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Porthos, brightening, \"that's well as regards my horse; but\nI must have the appointments complete, as they include objects which\na Musketeer alone can purchase, and which will not amount, besides, to\nmore than three hundred livres.\"\n\n\"Three hundred livres? Then put down three hundred livres,\" said the\nprocurator's wife, with a sigh.\n\nPorthos smiled. It may be remembered that he had the saddle which came\nfrom Buckingham. These three hundred livres he reckoned upon putting\nsnugly into his pocket.\n\n\"Then,\" continued he, \"there is a horse for my lackey, and my valise. As\nto my arms, it is useless to trouble you about them; I have them.\"\n\n\"A horse for your lackey?\" resumed the procurator's wife, hesitatingly;\n\"but that is doing things in lordly style, my friend.\"\n\n\"Ah, madame!\" said Porthos, haughtily; \"do you take me for a beggar?\"\n\n\"No; I only thought that a pretty mule makes sometimes as good an\nappearance as a horse, and it seemed to me that by getting a pretty mule\nfor Mousqueton--\"\n\n\"Well, agreed for a pretty mule,\" said Porthos; \"you are right, I have\nseen very great Spanish nobles whose whole suite were mounted on mules.\nBut then you understand, Madame Coquenard, a mule with feathers and\nbells.\"\n\n\"Be satisfied,\" said the procurator's wife.\n\n\"There remains the valise,\" added Porthos.\n\n\"Oh, don't let that disturb you,\" cried Mme. Coquenard. \"My husband\nhas five or six valises; you shall choose the best. There is one in\nparticular which he prefers in his journeys, large enough to hold all\nthe world.\"\n\n\"Your valise is then empty?\" asked Porthos, with simplicity.\n\n\"Certainly it is empty,\" replied the procurator's wife, in real\ninnocence.\n\n\"Ah, but the valise I want,\" cried Porthos, \"is a well-filled one, my\ndear.\"\n\nMadame uttered fresh sighs. Moliere had not written his scene in\n\"L'Avare\" then. Mme. Coquenard was in the dilemma of Harpagan.\n\nFinally, the rest of the equipment was successively debated in the same\nmanner; and the result of the sitting was that the procurator's wife\nshould give eight hundred livres in money, and should furnish the\nhorse and the mule which should have the honor of carrying Porthos and\nMousqueton to glory.\n\nThese conditions being agreed to, Porthos took leave of Mme. Coquenard.\nThe latter wished to detain him by darting certain tender glances;\nbut Porthos urged the commands of duty, and the procurator's wife was\nobliged to give place to the king.\n\nThe Musketeer returned home hungry and in bad humor.\n\n\n\n\n33 SOUBRETTE AND MISTRESS\n\nMeantime, as we have said, despite the cries of his conscience and\nthe wise counsels of Athos, d'Artagnan became hourly more in love with\nMilady. Thus he never failed to pay his diurnal court to her; and the\nself-satisfied Gascon was convinced that sooner or later she could not\nfail to respond.\n\nOne day, when he arrived with his head in the air, and as light at heart\nas a man who awaits a shower of gold, he found the SOUBRETTE under the\ngateway of the hotel; but this time the pretty Kitty was not contented\nwith touching him as he passed, she took him gently by the hand.\n\n\"Good!\" thought d'Artagnan, \"She is charged with some message for me\nfrom her mistress; she is about to appoint some rendezvous of which she\nhad not courage to speak.\" And he looked down at the pretty girl with\nthe most triumphant air imaginable.\n\n\"I wish to say three words to you, Monsieur Chevalier,\" stammered the\nSOUBRETTE.\n\n\"Speak, my child, speak,\" said d'Artagnan; \"I listen.\"\n\n\"Here? Impossible! That which I have to say is too long, and above all,\ntoo secret.\"\n\n\"Well, what is to be done?\"\n\n\"If Monsieur Chevalier would follow me?\" said Kitty, timidly.\n\n\"Where you please, my dear child.\"\n\n\"Come, then.\"\n\nAnd Kitty, who had not let go the hand of d'Artagnan, led him up a\nlittle dark, winding staircase, and after ascending about fifteen steps,\nopened a door.\n\n\"Come in here, Monsieur Chevalier,\" said she; \"here we shall be alone,\nand can talk.\"\n\n\"And whose room is this, my dear child?\"\n\n\"It is mine, Monsieur Chevalier; it communicates with my mistress's by\nthat door. But you need not fear. She will not hear what we say; she\nnever goes to bed before midnight.\"\n\nD'Artagnan cast a glance around him. The little apartment was charming\nfor its taste and neatness; but in spite of himself, his eyes were\ndirected to that door which Kitty said led to Milady's chamber.\n\nKitty guessed what was passing in the mind of the young man, and heaved\na deep sigh.\n\n\"You love my mistress, then, very dearly, Monsieur Chevalier?\" said she.\n\n\"Oh, more than I can say, Kitty! I am mad for her!\"\n\nKitty breathed a second sigh.\n\n\"Alas, monsieur,\" said she, \"that is too bad.\"\n\n\"What the devil do you see so bad in it?\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Because, monsieur,\" replied Kitty, \"my mistress loves you not at all.\"\n\n\"HEIN!\" said d'Artagnan, \"can she have charged you to tell me so?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, monsieur; but out of the regard I have for you, I have taken\nthe resolution to tell you so.\"\n\n\"Much obliged, my dear Kitty; but for the intention only--for the\ninformation, you must agree, is not likely to be at all agreeable.\"\n\n\"That is to say, you don't believe what I have told you; is it not so?\"\n\n\"We have always some difficulty in believing such things, my pretty\ndear, were it only from self-love.\"\n\n\"Then you don't believe me?\"\n\n\"I confess that unless you deign to give me some proof of what you\nadvance--\"\n\n\"What do you think of this?\"\n\nKitty drew a little note from her bosom.\n\n\"For me?\" said d'Artagnan, seizing the letter.\n\n\"No; for another.\"\n\n\"For another?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"His name; his name!\" cried d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Read the address.\"\n\n\"Monsieur El Comte de Wardes.\"\n\nThe remembrance of the scene at St. Germain presented itself to the\nmind of the presumptuous Gascon. As quick as thought, he tore open the\nletter, in spite of the cry which Kitty uttered on seeing what he was\ngoing to do, or rather, what he was doing.\n\n\"Oh, good Lord, Monsieur Chevalier,\" said she, \"what are you doing?\"\n\n\"I?\" said d'Artagnan; \"nothing,\" and he read,\n\n\n\"You have not answered my first note. Are you indisposed, or have you\nforgotten the glances you favored me with at the ball of Mme. de Guise?\nYou have an opportunity now, Count; do not allow it to escape.\"\n\n\nd'Artagnan became very pale; he was wounded in his SELF-love: he thought\nthat it was in his LOVE.\n\n\"Poor dear Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said Kitty, in a voice full of\ncompassion, and pressing anew the young man's hand.\n\n\"You pity me, little one?\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Oh, yes, and with all my heart; for I know what it is to be in love.\"\n\n\"You know what it is to be in love?\" said d'Artagnan, looking at her for\nthe first time with much attention.\n\n\"Alas, yes.\"\n\n\"Well, then, instead of pitying me, you would do much better to assist\nme in avenging myself on your mistress.\"\n\n\"And what sort of revenge would you take?\"\n\n\"I would triumph over her, and supplant my rival.\"\n\n\"I will never help you in that, Monsieur Chevalier,\" said Kitty, warmly.\n\n\"And why not?\" demanded d'Artagnan.\n\n\"For two reasons.\"\n\n\"What ones?\"\n\n\"The first is that my mistress will never love you.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\"\n\n\"You have cut her to the heart.\"\n\n\"I? In what can I have offended her--I who ever since I have known her\nhave lived at her feet like a slave? Speak, I beg you!\"\n\n\"I will never confess that but to the man--who should read to the bottom\nof my soul!\"\n\nD'Artagnan looked at Kitty for the second time. The young girl had\nfreshness and beauty which many duchesses would have purchased with\ntheir coronets.\n\n\"Kitty,\" said he, \"I will read to the bottom of your soul when-ever you\nlike; don't let that disturb you.\" And he gave her a kiss at which the\npoor girl became as red as a cherry.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Kitty, \"it is not me you love! It is my mistress you\nlove; you told me so just now.\"\n\n\"And does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason?\"\n\n\"The second reason, Monsieur the Chevalier,\" replied Kitty, emboldened\nby the kiss in the first place, and still further by the expression of\nthe eyes of the young man, \"is that in love, everyone for herself!\"\n\nThen only d'Artagnan remembered the languishing glances of Kitty, her\nconstantly meeting him in the antechamber, the corridor, or on the\nstairs, those touches of the hand every time she met him, and her deep\nsighs; but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady, he had\ndisdained the soubrette. He whose game is the eagle takes no heed of the\nsparrow.\n\nBut this time our Gascon saw at a glance all the advantage to be derived\nfrom the love which Kitty had just confessed so innocently, or so\nboldly: the interception of letters addressed to the Comte de Wardes,\nnews on the spot, entrance at all hours into Kitty's chamber, which\nwas contiguous to her mistress's. The perfidious deceiver was, as may\nplainly be perceived, already sacrificing, in intention, the poor girl\nin order to obtain Milady, willy-nilly.\n\n\"Well,\" said he to the young girl, \"are you willing, my dear Kitty, that\nI should give you a proof of that love which you doubt?\"\n\n\"What love?\" asked the young girl.\n\n\"Of that which I am ready to feel toward you.\"\n\n\"And what is that proof?\"\n\n\"Are you willing that I should this evening pass with you the time I\ngenerally spend with your mistress?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Kitty, clapping her hands, \"very willing.\"\n\n\"Well, then, come here, my dear,\" said d'Artagnan, establishing himself\nin an easy chair; \"come, and let me tell you that you are the prettiest\nSOUBRETTE I ever saw!\"\n\nAnd he did tell her so much, and so well, that the poor girl, who asked\nnothing better than to believe him, did believe him. Nevertheless,\nto d'Artagnan's great astonishment, the pretty Kitty defended herself\nresolutely.\n\nTime passes quickly when it is passed in attacks and defenses. Midnight\nsounded, and almost at the same time the bell was rung in Milady's\nchamber.\n\n\"Good God,\" cried Kitty, \"there is my mistress calling me! Go; go\ndirectly!\"\n\nD'Artagnan rose, took his hat, as if it had been his intention to obey,\nthen, opening quickly the door of a large closet instead of that leading\nto the staircase, he buried himself amid the robes and dressing gowns of\nMilady.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" cried Kitty.\n\nD'Artagnan, who had secured the key, shut himself up in the closet\nwithout reply.\n\n\"Well,\" cried Milady, in a sharp voice. \"Are you asleep, that you don't\nanswer when I ring?\"\n\nAnd d'Artagnan heard the door of communication opened violently.\n\n\"Here am I, Milady, here am I!\" cried Kitty, springing forward to meet\nher mistress.\n\nBoth went into the bedroom, and as the door of communication remained\nopen, d'Artagnan could hear Milady for some time scolding her maid. She\nwas at length appeased, and the conversation turned upon him while Kitty\nwas assisting her mistress.\n\n\"Well,\" said Milady, \"I have not seen our Gascon this evening.\"\n\n\"What, Milady! has he not come?\" said Kitty. \"Can he be inconstant\nbefore being happy?\"\n\n\"Oh, no; he must have been prevented by Monsieur de Treville or Monsieur\nDessessart. I understand my game, Kitty; I have this one safe.\"\n\n\"What will you do with him, madame?\"\n\n\"What will I do with him? Be easy, Kitty, there is something between\nthat man and me that he is quite ignorant of: he nearly made me lose my\ncredit with his Eminence. Oh, I will be revenged!\"\n\n\"I believed that Madame loved him.\"\n\n\"I love him? I detest him! An idiot, who held the life of Lord de Winter\nin his hands and did not kill him, by which I missed three hundred\nthousand livres' income.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said Kitty; \"your son was the only heir of his uncle, and\nuntil his majority you would have had the enjoyment of his fortune.\"\n\nD'Artagnan shuddered to the marrow at hearing this suave creature\nreproach him, with that sharp voice which she took such pains to conceal\nin conversation, for not having killed a man whom he had seen load her\nwith kindnesses.\n\n\"For all this,\" continued Milady, \"I should long ago have revenged\nmyself on him if, and I don't know why, the cardinal had not requested\nme to conciliate him.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; but Madame has not conciliated that little woman he was so\nfond of.\"\n\n\"What, the mercer's wife of the Rue des Fossoyeurs? Has he not already\nforgotten she ever existed? Fine vengeance that, on my faith!\"\n\nA cold sweat broke from d'Artagnan's brow. Why, this woman was a\nmonster! He resumed his listening, but unfortunately the toilet was\nfinished.\n\n\"That will do,\" said Milady; \"go into your own room, and tomorrow\nendeavor again to get me an answer to the letter I gave you.\"\n\n\"For Monsieur de Wardes?\" said Kitty.\n\n\"To be sure; for Monsieur de Wardes.\"\n\n\"Now, there is one,\" said Kitty, \"who appears to me quite a different\nsort of a man from that poor Monsieur d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Go to bed, mademoiselle,\" said Milady; \"I don't like comments.\"\n\nD'Artagnan heard the door close; then the noise of two bolts by which\nMilady fastened herself in. On her side, but as softly as possible,\nKitty turned the key of the lock, and then d'Artagnan opened the closet\ndoor.\n\n\"Oh, good Lord!\" said Kitty, in a low voice, \"what is the matter with\nyou? How pale you are!\"\n\n\"The abominable creature,\" murmured d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Silence, silence, begone!\" said Kitty. \"There is nothing but a wainscot\nbetween my chamber and Milady's; every word that is uttered in one can\nbe heard in the other.\"\n\n\"That's exactly the reason I won't go,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"What!\" said Kitty, blushing.\n\n\"Or, at least, I will go--later.\"\n\nHe drew Kitty to him. She had the less motive to resist, resistance\nwould make so much noise. Therefore Kitty surrendered.\n\nIt was a movement of vengeance upon Milady. D'Artagnan believed it right\nto say that vengeance is the pleasure of the gods. With a little more\nheart, he might have been contented with this new conquest; but the\nprincipal features of his character were ambition and pride. It must,\nhowever, be confessed in his justification that the first use he made of\nhis influence over Kitty was to try and find out what had become of Mme.\nBonacieux; but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to d'Artagnan that\nshe was entirely ignorant on that head, her mistress never admitting her\ninto half her secrets--only she believed she could say she was not dead.\n\nAs to the cause which was near making Milady lose her credit with the\ncardinal, Kitty knew nothing about it; but this time d'Artagnan was\nbetter informed than she was. As he had seen Milady on board a vessel\nat the moment he was leaving England, he suspected that it was, almost\nwithout a doubt, on account of the diamond studs.\n\nBut what was clearest in all this was that the true hatred, the profound\nhatred, the inveterate hatred of Milady, was increased by his not having\nkilled her brother-in-law.\n\nD'Artagnan came the next day to Milady's, and finding her in a very\nill-humor, had no doubt that it was lack of an answer from M. de Wardes\nthat provoked her thus. Kitty came in, but Milady was very cross with\nher. The poor girl ventured a glance at d'Artagnan which said, \"See how\nI suffer on your account!\"\n\nToward the end of the evening, however, the beautiful lioness became\nmilder; she smilingly listened to the soft speeches of d'Artagnan, and\neven gave him her hand to kiss.\n\nD'Artagnan departed, scarcely knowing what to think, but as he was a\nyouth who did not easily lose his head, while continuing to pay his\ncourt to Milady, he had framed a little plan in his mind.\n\nHe found Kitty at the gate, and, as on the preceding evening, went up to\nher chamber. Kitty had been accused of negligence and severely scolded.\nMilady could not at all comprehend the silence of the Comte de Wardes,\nand she ordered Kitty to come at nine o'clock in the morning to take a\nthird letter.\n\nD'Artagnan made Kitty promise to bring him that letter on the following\nmorning. The poor girl promised all her lover desired; she was mad.\n\nThings passed as on the night before. D'Artagnan concealed himself in\nhis closet; Milady called, undressed, sent away Kitty, and shut the\ndoor. As the night before, d'Artagnan did not return home till five\no'clock in the morning.\n\nAt eleven o'clock Kitty came to him. She held in her hand a fresh billet\nfrom Milady. This time the poor girl did not even argue with d'Artagnan;\nshe gave it to him at once. She belonged body and soul to her handsome\nsoldier.\n\nD'Artagnan opened the letter and read as follows:\n\n\nThis is the third time I have written to you to tell you that I love\nyou. Beware that I do not write to you a fourth time to tell you that I\ndetest you.\n\nIf you repent of the manner in which you have acted toward me, the young\ngirl who brings you this will tell you how a man of spirit may obtain\nhis pardon.\n\n\nd'Artagnan colored and grew pale several times in reading this billet.\n\n\"Oh, you love her still,\" said Kitty, who had not taken her eyes off the\nyoung man's countenance for an instant.\n\n\"No, Kitty, you are mistaken. I do not love her, but I will avenge\nmyself for her contempt.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I know what sort of vengeance! You told me that!\"\n\n\"What matters it to you, Kitty? You know it is you alone whom I love.\"\n\n\"How can I know that?\"\n\n\"By the scorn I will throw upon her.\"\n\nD'Artagnan took a pen and wrote:\n\n\nMadame, Until the present moment I could not believe that it was to me\nyour first two letters were addressed, so unworthy did I feel myself of\nsuch an honor; besides, I was so seriously indisposed that I could not\nin any case have replied to them.\n\nBut now I am forced to believe in the excess of your kindness, since\nnot only your letter but your servant assures me that I have the good\nfortune to be beloved by you.\n\nShe has no occasion to teach me the way in which a man of spirit may\nobtain his pardon. I will come and ask mine at eleven o'clock this\nevening.\n\nTo delay it a single day would be in my eyes now to commit a fresh\noffense.\n\nFrom him whom you have rendered the happiest of men, Comte de Wardes\n\n\nThis note was in the first place a forgery; it was likewise an\nindelicacy. It was even, according to our present manners, something\nlike an infamous action; but at that period people did not manage\naffairs as they do today. Besides, d'Artagnan from her own admission\nknew Milady culpable of treachery in matters more important, and could\nentertain no respect for her. And yet, notwithstanding this want of\nrespect, he felt an uncontrollable passion for this woman boiling in his\nveins--passion drunk with contempt; but passion or thirst, as the reader\npleases.\n\nD'Artagnan's plan was very simple. By Kitty's chamber he could gain\nthat of her mistress. He would take advantage of the first moment of\nsurprise, shame, and terror, to triumph over her. He might fail, but\nsomething must be left to chance. In eight days the campaign would open,\nand he would be compelled to leave Paris; d'Artagnan had no time for a\nprolonged love siege.\n\n\"There,\" said the young man, handing Kitty the letter sealed; \"give that\nto Milady. It is the count's reply.\"\n\nPoor Kitty became as pale as death; she suspected what the letter\ncontained.\n\n\"Listen, my dear girl,\" said d'Artagnan; \"you cannot but perceive that\nall this must end, some way or other. Milady may discover that you gave\nthe first billet to my lackey instead of to the count's; that it is I\nwho have opened the others which ought to have been opened by de Wardes.\nMilady will then turn you out of doors, and you know she is not the\nwoman to limit her vengeance.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" said Kitty, \"for whom have I exposed myself to all that?\"\n\n\"For me, I well know, my sweet girl,\" said d'Artagnan. \"But I am\ngrateful, I swear to you.\"\n\n\"But what does this note contain?\"\n\n\"Milady will tell you.\"\n\n\"Ah, you do not love me!\" cried Kitty, \"and I am very wretched.\"\n\nTo this reproach there is always one response which deludes women.\nD'Artagnan replied in such a manner that Kitty remained in her great\ndelusion. Although she cried freely before deciding to transmit the\nletter to her mistress, she did at last so decide, which was all\nd'Artagnan wished. Finally he promised that he would leave her\nmistress's presence at an early hour that evening, and that when he left\nthe mistress he would ascend with the maid. This promise completed poor\nKitty's consolation.\n\n\n\n\n34 IN WHICH THE EQUIPMENT OF ARAMIS AND PORTHOS IS TREATED OF\n\nSince the four friends had been each in search of his equipments,\nthere had been no fixed meeting between them. They dined apart from one\nanother, wherever they might happen to be, or rather where they could.\nDuty likewise on its part took a portion of that precious time which was\ngliding away so rapidly--only they had agreed to meet once a week, about\none o'clock, at the residence of Athos, seeing that he, in agreement\nwith the vow he had formed, did not pass over the threshold of his door.\n\nThis day of reunion was the same day as that on which Kitty came to find\nd'Artagnan. Soon as Kitty left him, d'Artagnan directed his steps toward\nthe Rue Ferou.\n\nHe found Athos and Aramis philosophizing. Aramis had some slight\ninclination to resume the cassock. Athos, according to his system,\nneither encouraged nor dissuaded him. Athos believed that everyone\nshould be left to his own free will. He never gave advice but when it\nwas asked, and even then he required to be asked twice.\n\n\"People, in general,\" he said, \"only ask advice not to follow it; or\nif they do follow it, it is for the sake of having someone to blame for\nhaving given it.\"\n\nPorthos arrived a minute after d'Artagnan. The four friends were\nreunited.\n\nThe four countenances expressed four different feelings: that of\nPorthos, tranquillity; that of d'Artagnan, hope; that of Aramis,\nuneasiness; that of Athos, carelessness.\n\nAt the end of a moment's conversation, in which Porthos hinted that\na lady of elevated rank had condescended to relieve him from his\nembarrassment, Mousqueton entered. He came to request his master to\nreturn to his lodgings, where his presence was urgent, as he piteously\nsaid.\n\n\"Is it my equipment?\"\n\n\"Yes and no,\" replied Mousqueton.\n\n\"Well, but can't you speak?\"\n\n\"Come, monsieur.\"\n\nPorthos rose, saluted his friends, and followed Mousqueton. An instant\nafter, Bazin made his appearance at the door.\n\n\"What do you want with me, my friend?\" said Aramis, with that mildness\nof language which was observable in him every time that his ideas were\ndirected toward the Church.\n\n\"A man wishes to see Monsieur at home,\" replied Bazin.\n\n\"A man! What man?\"\n\n\"A mendicant.\"\n\n\"Give him alms, Bazin, and bid him pray for a poor sinner.\"\n\n\"This mendicant insists upon speaking to you, and pretends that you will\nbe very glad to see him.\"\n\n\"Has he sent no particular message for me?\"\n\n\"Yes. If Monsieur Aramis hesitates to come,\" he said, \"tell him I am\nfrom Tours.\"\n\n\"From Tours!\" cried Aramis. \"A thousand pardons, gentlemen; but no doubt\nthis man brings me the news I expected.\" And rising also, he went off at\na quick pace. There remained Athos and d'Artagnan.\n\n\"I believe these fellows have managed their business. What do you think,\nd'Artagnan?\" said Athos.\n\n\"I know that Porthos was in a fair way,\" replied d'Artagnan; \"and as to\nAramis to tell you the truth, I have never been seriously uneasy on his\naccount. But you, my dear Athos--you, who so generously distributed the\nEnglishman's pistoles, which were our legitimate property--what do you\nmean to do?\"\n\n\"I am satisfied with having killed that fellow, my boy, seeing that\nit is blessed bread to kill an Englishman; but if I had pocketed his\npistoles, they would have weighed me down like a remorse.\n\n\"Go to, my dear Athos; you have truly inconceivable ideas.\"\n\n\"Let it pass. What do you think of Monsieur de Treville telling me, when\nhe did me the honor to call upon me yesterday, that you associated with\nthe suspected English, whom the cardinal protects?\"\n\n\"That is to say, I visit an Englishwoman--the one I named.\"\n\n\"Oh, ay! the fair woman on whose account I gave you advice, which\nnaturally you took care not to adopt.\"\n\n\"I gave you my reasons.\"\n\n\"Yes; you look there for your outfit, I think you said.\"\n\n\"Not at all. I have acquired certain knowledge that that woman was\nconcerned in the abduction of Madame Bonacieux.\"\n\n\"Yes, I understand now: to find one woman, you court another. It is the\nlongest road, but certainly the most amusing.\"\n\nD'Artagnan was on the point of telling Athos all; but one consideration\nrestrained him. Athos was a gentleman, punctilious in points of honor;\nand there were in the plan which our lover had devised for Milady,\nhe was sure, certain things that would not obtain the assent of this\nPuritan. He was therefore silent; and as Athos was the least inquisitive\nof any man on earth, d'Artagnan's confidence stopped there. We will\ntherefore leave the two friends, who had nothing important to say to\neach other, and follow Aramis.\n\nUpon being informed that the person who wanted to speak to him came from\nTours, we have seen with what rapidity the young man followed, or rather\nwent before, Bazin; he ran without stopping from the Rue Ferou to\nthe Rue de Vaugirard. On entering he found a man of short stature and\nintelligent eyes, but covered with rags.\n\n\"You have asked for me?\" said the Musketeer.\n\n\"I wish to speak with Monsieur Aramis. Is that your name, monsieur?\"\n\n\"My very own. You have brought me something?\"\n\n\"Yes, if you show me a certain embroidered handkerchief.\"\n\n\"Here it is,\" said Aramis, taking a small key from his breast and\nopening a little ebony box inlaid with mother of pearl, \"here it is.\nLook.\"\n\n\"That is right,\" replied the mendicant; \"dismiss your lackey.\"\n\nIn fact, Bazin, curious to know what the mendicant could want with his\nmaster, kept pace with him as well as he could, and arrived almost at\nthe same time he did; but his quickness was not of much use to him. At\nthe hint from the mendicant his master made him a sign to retire, and he\nwas obliged to obey.\n\nBazin gone, the mendicant cast a rapid glance around him in order to be\nsure that nobody could either see or hear him, and opening his ragged\nvest, badly held together by a leather strap, he began to rip the upper\npart of his doublet, from which he drew a letter.\n\nAramis uttered a cry of joy at the sight of the seal, kissed the\nsuperscription with an almost religious respect, and opened the epistle,\nwhich contained what follows:\n\n\n\"My Friend, it is the will of fate that we should be still for some time\nseparated; but the delightful days of youth are not lost beyond return.\nPerform your duty in camp; I will do mine elsewhere. Accept that which\nthe bearer brings you; make the campaign like a handsome true gentleman,\nand think of me, who kisses tenderly your black eyes.\n\n\"Adieu; or rather, AU REVOIR.\"\n\n\nThe mendicant continued to rip his garments; and drew from amid his rags\na hundred and fifty Spanish double pistoles, which he laid down on the\ntable; then he opened the door, bowed, and went out before the young\nman, stupefied by his letter, had ventured to address a word to him.\n\nAramis then reperused the letter, and perceived a postscript:\n\n\nP.S. You may behave politely to the bearer, who is a count and a grandee\nof Spain!\n\n\"Golden dreams!\" cried Aramis. \"Oh, beautiful life! Yes, we are young;\nyes, we shall yet have happy days! My love, my blood, my life! all, all,\nall, are thine, my adored mistress!\"\n\nAnd he kissed the letter with passion, without even vouchsafing a look\nat the gold which sparkled on the table.\n\nBazin scratched at the door, and as Aramis had no longer any reason to\nexclude him, he bade him come in.\n\nBazin was stupefied at the sight of the gold, and forgot that he came\nto announce d'Artagnan, who, curious to know who the mendicant could be,\ncame to Aramis on leaving Athos.\n\nNow, as d'Artagnan used no ceremony with Aramis, seeing that Bazin\nforgot to announce him, he announced himself.\n\n\"The devil! my dear Aramis,\" said d'Artagnan, \"if these are the prunes\nthat are sent to you from Tours, I beg you will make my compliments to\nthe gardener who gathers them.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, friend d'Artagnan,\" said Aramis, always on his guard;\n\"this is from my publisher, who has just sent me the price of that poem\nin one-syllable verse which I began yonder.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed,\" said d'Artagnan. \"Well, your publisher is very generous,\nmy dear Aramis, that's all I can say.\"\n\n\"How, monsieur?\" cried Bazin, \"a poem sell so dear as that! It is\nincredible! Oh, monsieur, you can write as much as you like; you may\nbecome equal to Monsieur de Voiture and Monsieur de Benserade. I like\nthat. A poet is as good as an abbe. Ah! Monsieur Aramis, become a poet,\nI beg of you.\"\n\n\"Bazin, my friend,\" said Aramis, \"I believe you meddle with my\nconversation.\"\n\nBazin perceived he was wrong; he bowed and went out.\n\n\"Ah!\" said d'Artagnan with a smile, \"you sell your productions at their\nweight in gold. You are very fortunate, my friend; but take care or you\nwill lose that letter which is peeping from your doublet, and which also\ncomes, no doubt, from your publisher.\"\n\nAramis blushed to the eyes, crammed in the letter, and re-buttoned his\ndoublet.\n\n\"My dear d'Artagnan,\" said he, \"if you please, we will join our friends;\nas I am rich, we will today begin to dine together again, expecting that\nyou will be rich in your turn.\"\n\n\"My faith!\" said d'Artagnan, with great pleasure. \"It is long since we\nhave had a good dinner; and I, for my part, have a somewhat hazardous\nexpedition for this evening, and shall not be sorry, I confess, to\nfortify myself with a few glasses of good old Burgundy.\"\n\n\"Agreed, as to the old Burgundy; I have no objection to that,\" said\nAramis, from whom the letter and the gold had removed, as by magic, his\nideas of conversion.\n\nAnd having put three or four double pistoles into his pocket to answer\nthe needs of the moment, he placed the others in the ebony box, inlaid\nwith mother of pearl, in which was the famous handkerchief which served\nhim as a talisman.\n\nThe two friends repaired to Athos's, and he, faithful to his vow of not\ngoing out, took upon him to order dinner to be brought to them. As he\nwas perfectly acquainted with the details of gastronomy, d'Artagnan and\nAramis made no objection to abandoning this important care to him.\n\nThey went to find Porthos, and at the corner of the Rue Bac met\nMousqueton, who, with a most pitiable air, was driving before him a mule\nand a horse.\n\nD'Artagnan uttered a cry of surprise, which was not quite free from joy.\n\n\"Ah, my yellow horse,\" cried he. \"Aramis, look at that horse!\"\n\n\"Oh, the frightful brute!\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Ah, my dear,\" replied d'Artagnan, \"upon that very horse I came to\nParis.\"\n\n\"What, does Monsieur know this horse?\" said Mousqueton.\n\n\"It is of an original color,\" said Aramis; \"I never saw one with such a\nhide in my life.\"\n\n\"I can well believe it,\" replied d'Artagnan, \"and that was why I got\nthree crowns for him. It must have been for his hide, for, CERTES, the\ncarcass is not worth eighteen livres. But how did this horse come into\nyour bands, Mousqueton?\"\n\n\"Pray,\" said the lackey, \"say nothing about it, monsieur; it is a\nfrightful trick of the husband of our duchess!\"\n\n\"How is that, Mousqueton?\"\n\n\"Why, we are looked upon with a rather favorable eye by a lady of\nquality, the Duchesse de--but, your pardon; my master has commanded\nme to be discreet. She had forced us to accept a little souvenir, a\nmagnificent Spanish GENET and an Andalusian mule, which were beautiful\nto look upon. The husband heard of the affair; on their way he\nconfiscated the two magnificent beasts which were being sent to us, and\nsubstituted these horrible animals.\"\n\n\"Which you are taking back to him?\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Exactly!\" replied Mousqueton. \"You may well believe that we will\nnot accept such steeds as these in exchange for those which had been\npromised to us.\"\n\n\"No, PARDIEU; though I should like to have seen Porthos on my yellow\nhorse. That would give me an idea of how I looked when I arrived in\nParis. But don't let us hinder you, Mousqueton; go and perform your\nmaster's orders. Is he at home?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" said Mousqueton, \"but in a very ill humor. Get up!\"\n\nHe continued his way toward the Quai des Grands Augustins, while the two\nfriends went to ring at the bell of the unfortunate Porthos. He, having\nseen them crossing the yard, took care not to answer, and they rang in\nvain.\n\nMeanwhile Mousqueton continued on his way, and crossing the Pont Neuf,\nstill driving the two sorry animals before him, he reached the Rue aux\nOurs. Arrived there, he fastened, according to the orders of his master,\nboth horse and mule to the knocker of the procurator's door; then,\nwithout taking any thought for their future, he returned to Porthos, and\ntold him that his commission was completed.\n\nIn a short time the two unfortunate beasts, who had not eaten anything\nsince the morning, made such a noise in raising and letting fall the\nknocker that the procurator ordered his errand boy to go and inquire in\nthe neighborhood to whom this horse and mule belonged.\n\nMme. Coquenard recognized her present, and could not at first comprehend\nthis restitution; but the visit of Porthos soon enlightened her. The\nanger which fired the eyes of the Musketeer, in spite of his efforts to\nsuppress it, terrified his sensitive inamorata. In fact, Mousqueton had\nnot concealed from his master that he had met d'Artagnan and Aramis,\nand that d'Artagnan in the yellow horse had recognized the Bearnese pony\nupon which he had come to Paris, and which he had sold for three crowns.\n\nPorthos went away after having appointed a meeting with the procurator's\nwife in the cloister of St. Magloire. The procurator, seeing he was\ngoing, invited him to dinner--an invitation which the Musketeer refused\nwith a majestic air.\n\nMme. Coquenard repaired trembling to the cloister of St. Magloire,\nfor she guessed the reproaches that awaited her there; but she was\nfascinated by the lofty airs of Porthos.\n\nAll that which a man wounded in his self-love could let fall in the\nshape of imprecations and reproaches upon the head of a woman Porthos\nlet fall upon the bowed head of the procurator's wife.\n\n\"Alas,\" said she, \"I did all for the best! One of our clients is a\nhorsedealer; he owes money to the office, and is backward in his pay. I\ntook the mule and the horse for what he owed us; he assured me that they\nwere two noble steeds.\"\n\n\"Well, madame,\" said Porthos, \"if he owed you more than five crowns,\nyour horsedealer is a thief.\"\n\n\"There is no harm in trying to buy things cheap, Monsieur Porthos,\" said\nthe procurator's wife, seeking to excuse herself.\n\n\"No, madame; but they who so assiduously try to buy things cheap ought\nto permit others to seek more generous friends.\" And Porthos, turning on\nhis heel, made a step to retire.\n\n\"Monsieur Porthos! Monsieur Porthos!\" cried the procurator's wife. \"I\nhave been wrong; I see it. I ought not to have driven a bargain when it\nwas to equip a cavalier like you.\"\n\nPorthos, without reply, retreated a second step. The procurator's wife\nfancied she saw him in a brilliant cloud, all surrounded by duchesses\nand marchionesses, who cast bags of money at his feet.\n\n\"Stop, in the name of heaven, Monsieur Porthos!\" cried she. \"Stop, and\nlet us talk.\"\n\n\"Talking with you brings me misfortune,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"But, tell me, what do you ask?\"\n\n\"Nothing; for that amounts to the same thing as if I asked you for\nsomething.\"\n\nThe procurator's wife hung upon the arm of Porthos, and in the violence\nof her grief she cried out, \"Monsieur Porthos, I am ignorant of all such\nmatters! How should I know what a horse is? How should I know what horse\nfurniture is?\"\n\n\"You should have left it to me, then, madame, who know what they are;\nbut you wished to be frugal, and consequently to lend at usury.\"\n\n\"It was wrong, Monsieur Porthos; but I will repair that wrong, upon my\nword of honor.\"\n\n\"How so?\" asked the Musketeer.\n\n\"Listen. This evening M. Coquenard is going to the house of the Due de\nChaulnes, who has sent for him. It is for a consultation, which will\nlast three hours at least. Come! We shall be alone, and can make up our\naccounts.\"\n\n\"In good time. Now you talk, my dear.\"\n\n\"You pardon me?\"\n\n\"We shall see,\" said Porthos, majestically; and the two separated\nsaying, \"Till this evening.\"\n\n\"The devil!\" thought Porthos, as he walked away, \"it appears I am\ngetting nearer to Monsieur Coquenard's strongbox at last.\"\n\n\n\n\n35 A GASCON A MATCH FOR CUPID\n\nThe evening so impatiently waited for by Porthos and by d'Artagnan at\nlast arrived.\n\nAs was his custom, d'Artagnan presented himself at Milady's at about\nnine o'clock. He found her in a charming humor. Never had he been so\nwell received. Our Gascon knew, by the first glance of his eye, that his\nbillet had been delivered, and that this billet had had its effect.\n\nKitty entered to bring some sherbet. Her mistress put on a charming\nface, and smiled on her graciously; but alas! the poor girl was so sad\nthat she did not even notice Milady's condescension.\n\nD'Artagnan looked at the two women, one after the other, and was forced\nto acknowledge that in his opinion Dame Nature had made a mistake in\ntheir formation. To the great lady she had given a heart vile and venal;\nto the SOUBRETTE she had given the heart of a duchess.\n\nAt ten o'clock Milady began to appear restless. D'Artagnan knew what\nshe wanted. She looked at the clock, rose, reseated herself, smiled at\nd'Artagnan with an air which said, \"You are very amiable, no doubt, but\nyou would be charming if you would only depart.\"\n\nD'Artagnan rose and took his hat; Milady gave him her hand to kiss.\nThe young man felt her press his hand, and comprehended that this was a\nsentiment, not of coquetry, but of gratitude because of his departure.\n\n\"She loves him devilishly,\" he murmured. Then he went out.\n\nThis time Kitty was nowhere waiting for him; neither in the antechamber,\nnor in the corridor, nor beneath the great door. It was necessary that\nd'Artagnan should find alone the staircase and the little chamber. She\nheard him enter, but she did not raise her head. The young man went to\nher and took her hands; then she sobbed aloud.\n\nAs d'Artagnan had presumed, on receiving his letter, Milady in\na delirium of joy had told her servant everything; and by way of\nrecompense for the manner in which she had this time executed the\ncommission, she had given Kitty a purse.\n\nReturning to her own room, Kitty had thrown the purse into a corner,\nwhere it lay open, disgorging three or four gold pieces on the carpet.\nThe poor girl, under the caresses of d'Artagnan, lifted her head.\nD'Artagnan himself was frightened by the change in her countenance. She\njoined her hands with a suppliant air, but without venturing to speak a\nword. As little sensitive as was the heart of d'Artagnan, he was touched\nby this mute sorrow; but he held too tenaciously to his projects, above\nall to this one, to change the program which he had laid out in advance.\nHe did not therefore allow her any hope that he would flinch; only he\nrepresented his action as one of simple vengeance.\n\nFor the rest this vengeance was very easy; for Milady, doubtless to\nconceal her blushes from her lover, had ordered Kitty to extinguish\nall the lights in the apartment, and even in the little chamber\nitself. Before daybreak M. de Wardes must take his departure, still in\nobscurity.\n\nPresently they heard Milady retire to her room. D'Artagnan slipped into\nthe wardrobe. Hardly was he concealed when the little bell sounded.\nKitty went to her mistress, and did not leave the door open; but the\npartition was so thin that one could hear nearly all that passed between\nthe two women.\n\nMilady seemed overcome with joy, and made Kitty repeat the smallest\ndetails of the pretended interview of the soubrette with de Wardes when\nhe received the letter; how he had responded; what was the expression\nof his face; if he seemed very amorous. And to all these questions poor\nKitty, forced to put on a pleasant face, responded in a stifled voice\nwhose dolorous accent her mistress did not however remark, solely\nbecause happiness is egotistical.\n\nFinally, as the hour for her interview with the count approached, Milady\nhad everything about her darkened, and ordered Kitty to return to her\nown chamber, and introduce de Wardes whenever he presented himself.\n\nKitty's detention was not long. Hardly had d'Artagnan seen, through a\ncrevice in his closet, that the whole apartment was in obscurity,\nthan he slipped out of his concealment, at the very moment when Kitty\nreclosed the door of communication.\n\n\"What is that noise?\" demanded Milady.\n\n\"It is I,\" said d'Artagnan in a subdued voice, \"I, the Comte de Wardes.\"\n\n\"Oh, my God, my God!\" murmured Kitty, \"he has not even waited for the\nhour he himself named!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Milady, in a trembling voice, \"why do you not enter? Count,\nCount,\" added she, \"you know that I wait for you.\"\n\nAt this appeal d'Artagnan drew Kitty quietly away, and slipped into the\nchamber.\n\nIf rage or sorrow ever torture the heart, it is when a lover receives\nunder a name which is not his own protestations of love addressed to\nhis happy rival. D'Artagnan was in a dolorous situation which he had not\nforeseen. Jealousy gnawed his heart; and he suffered almost as much as\npoor Kitty, who at that very moment was crying in the next chamber.\n\n\"Yes, Count,\" said Milady, in her softest voice, and pressing his hand\nin her own, \"I am happy in the love which your looks and your words\nhave expressed to me every time we have met. I also--I love you. Oh,\ntomorrow, tomorrow, I must have some pledge from you which will prove\nthat you think of me; and that you may not forget me, take this!\"\nand she slipped a ring from her finger onto d'Artagnan's. d'Artagnan\nremembered having seen this ring on the finger of Milady; it was a\nmagnificent sapphire, encircled with brilliants.\n\nThe first movement of d'Artagnan was to return it, but Milady added,\n\"No, no! Keep that ring for love of me. Besides, in accepting it,\" she\nadded, in a voice full of emotion, \"you render me a much greater service\nthan you imagine.\"\n\n\"This woman is full of mysteries,\" murmured d'Artagnan to himself. At\nthat instant he felt himself ready to reveal all. He even opened his\nmouth to tell Milady who he was, and with what a revengeful purpose\nhe had come; but she added, \"Poor angel, whom that monster of a Gascon\nbarely failed to kill.\"\n\nThe monster was himself.\n\n\"Oh,\" continued Milady, \"do your wounds still make you suffer?\"\n\n\"Yes, much,\" said d'Artagnan, who did not well know how to answer.\n\n\"Be tranquil,\" murmured Milady; \"I will avenge you--and cruelly!\"\n\n\"PESTE!\" said d'Artagnan to himself, \"the moment for confidences has not\nyet come.\"\n\nIt took some time for d'Artagnan to resume this little dialogue; but\nthen all the ideas of vengeance which he had brought with him had\ncompletely vanished. This woman exercised over him an unaccountable\npower; he hated and adored her at the same time. He would not have\nbelieved that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart,\nand by their union constitute a passion so strange, and as it were,\ndiabolical.\n\nPresently it sounded one o'clock. It was necessary to separate.\nD'Artagnan at the moment of quitting Milady felt only the liveliest\nregret at the parting; and as they addressed each other in a\nreciprocally passionate adieu, another interview was arranged for the\nfollowing week.\n\nPoor Kitty hoped to speak a few words to d'Artagnan when he passed\nthrough her chamber; but Milady herself reconducted him through the\ndarkness, and only quit him at the staircase.\n\nThe next morning d'Artagnan ran to find Athos. He was engaged in an\nadventure so singular that he wished for counsel. He therefore told him\nall.\n\n\"Your Milady,\" said he, \"appears to be an infamous creature, but not the\nless you have done wrong to deceive her. In one fashion or another you\nhave a terrible enemy on your hands.\"\n\nWhile thus speaking Athos regarded with attention the sapphire set\nwith diamonds which had taken, on d'Artagnan's finger, the place of the\nqueen's ring, carefully kept in a casket.\n\n\"You notice my ring?\" said the Gascon, proud to display so rich a gift\nin the eyes of his friends.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Athos, \"it reminds me of a family jewel.\"\n\n\"It is beautiful, is it not?\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Athos, \"magnificent. I did not think two sapphires of such a\nfine water existed. Have you traded it for your diamond?\"\n\n\"No. It is a gift from my beautiful Englishwoman, or rather\nFrenchwoman--for I am convinced she was born in France, though I have\nnot questioned her.\"\n\n\"That ring comes from Milady?\" cried Athos, with a voice in which it was\neasy to detect strong emotion.\n\n\"Her very self; she gave it me last night. Here it is,\" replied\nd'Artagnan, taking it from his finger.\n\nAthos examined it and became very pale. He tried it on his left hand; it\nfit his finger as if made for it.\n\nA shade of anger and vengeance passed across the usually calm brow of\nthis gentleman.\n\n\"It is impossible it can be she,\" said he. \"How could this ring come\ninto the hands of Milady Clarik? And yet it is difficult to suppose such\na resemblance should exist between two jewels.\"\n\n\"Do you know this ring?\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"I thought I did,\" replied Athos; \"but no doubt I was mistaken.\" And he\nreturned d'Artagnan the ring without, however, ceasing to look at it.\n\n\"Pray, d'Artagnan,\" said Athos, after a minute, \"either take off that\nring or turn the mounting inside; it recalls such cruel recollections\nthat I shall have no head to converse with you. Don't ask me for\ncounsel; don't tell me you are perplexed what to do. But stop! let me\nlook at that sapphire again; the one I mentioned to you had one of its\nfaces scratched by accident.\"\n\nD'Artagnan took off the ring, giving it again to Athos.\n\nAthos started. \"Look,\" said he, \"is it not strange?\" and he pointed out\nto d'Artagnan the scratch he had remembered.\n\n\"But from whom did this ring come to you, Athos?\"\n\n\"From my mother, who inherited it from her mother. As I told you, it is\nan old family jewel.\"\n\n\"And you--sold it?\" asked d'Artagnan, hesitatingly.\n\n\"No,\" replied Athos, with a singular smile. \"I gave it away in a night\nof love, as it has been given to you.\"\n\nD'Artagnan became pensive in his turn; it appeared as if there were\nabysses in Milady's soul whose depths were dark and unknown. He took\nback the ring, but put it in his pocket and not on his finger.\n\n\"d'Artagnan,\" said Athos, taking his hand, \"you know I love you; if I\nhad a son I could not love him better. Take my advice, renounce this\nwoman. I do not know her, but a sort of intuition tells me she is a lost\ncreature, and that there is something fatal about her.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said d'Artagnan; \"I will have done with her. I own that\nthis woman terrifies me.\"\n\n\"Shall you have the courage?\" said Athos.\n\n\"I shall,\" replied d'Artagnan, \"and instantly.\"\n\n\"In truth, my young friend, you will act rightly,\" said the gentleman,\npressing the Gascon's hand with an affection almost paternal; \"and God\ngrant that this woman, who has scarcely entered into your life, may not\nleave a terrible trace in it!\" And Athos bowed to d'Artagnan like a man\nwho wishes it understood that he would not be sorry to be left alone\nwith his thoughts.\n\nOn reaching home d'Artagnan found Kitty waiting for him. A month\nof fever could not have changed her more than this one night of\nsleeplessness and sorrow.\n\nShe was sent by her mistress to the false de Wardes. Her mistress was\nmad with love, intoxicated with joy. She wished to know when her lover\nwould meet her a second night; and poor Kitty, pale and trembling,\nawaited d'Artagnan's reply. The counsels of his friend, joined to the\ncries of his own heart, made him determine, now his pride was saved and\nhis vengeance satisfied, not to see Milady again. As a reply, he wrote\nthe following letter:\n\n\nDo not depend upon me, madame, for the next meeting. Since my\nconvalescence I have so many affairs of this kind on my hands that I am\nforced to regulate them a little. When your turn comes, I shall have the\nhonor to inform you of it. I kiss your hands.\n\nComte de Wardes\n\n\nNot a word about the sapphire. Was the Gascon determined to keep it as a\nweapon against Milady, or else, let us be frank, did he not reserve the\nsapphire as a last resource for his outfit? It would be wrong to judge\nthe actions of one period from the point of view of another. That which\nwould now be considered as disgraceful to a gentleman was at that time\nquite a simple and natural affair, and the younger sons of the best\nfamilies were frequently supported by their mistresses. D'Artagnan gave\nthe open letter to Kitty, who at first was unable to comprehend it, but\nwho became almost wild with joy on reading it a second time. She could\nscarcely believe in her happiness; and d'Artagnan was forced to renew\nwith the living voice the assurances which he had written. And whatever\nmight be--considering the violent character of Milady--the danger which\nthe poor girl incurred in giving this billet to her mistress, she ran\nback to the Place Royale as fast as her legs could carry her.\n\nThe heart of the best woman is pitiless toward the sorrows of a rival.\n\nMilady opened the letter with eagerness equal to Kitty's in bringing it;\nbut at the first words she read she became livid. She crushed the paper\nin her hand, and turning with flashing eyes upon Kitty, she cried, \"What\nis this letter?\"\n\n\"The answer to Madame's,\" replied Kitty, all in a tremble.\n\n\"Impossible!\" cried Milady. \"It is impossible a gentleman could have\nwritten such a letter to a woman.\" Then all at once, starting, she\ncried, \"My God! can he have--\" and she stopped. She ground her teeth;\nshe was of the color of ashes. She tried to go toward the window for\nair, but she could only stretch forth her arms; her legs failed her, and\nshe sank into an armchair. Kitty, fearing she was ill, hastened toward\nher and was beginning to open her dress; but Milady started up, pushing\nher away. \"What do you want with me?\" said she, \"and why do you place\nyour hand on me?\"\n\n\"I thought that Madame was ill, and I wished to bring her help,\"\nresponded the maid, frightened at the terrible expression which had come\nover her mistress's face.\n\n\"I faint? I? I? Do you take me for half a woman? When I am insulted I do\nnot faint; I avenge myself!\"\n\nAnd she made a sign for Kitty to leave the room.\n\n\n\n\n36 DREAM OF VENGEANCE\n\nThat evening Milady gave orders that when M. d'Artagnan came as usual,\nhe should be immediately admitted; but he did not come.\n\nThe next day Kitty went to see the young man again, and related to him\nall that had passed on the preceding evening. d'Artagnan smiled; this\njealous anger of Milady was his revenge.\n\nThat evening Milady was still more impatient than on the preceding\nevening. She renewed the order relative to the Gascon; but as before she\nexpected him in vain.\n\nThe next morning, when Kitty presented herself at d'Artagnan's, she\nwas no longer joyous and alert as on the two preceding days; but on the\ncontrary sad as death.\n\nD'Artagnan asked the poor girl what was the matter with her; but she, as\nher only reply, drew a letter from her pocket and gave it to him.\n\nThis letter was in Milady's handwriting; only this time it was addressed\nto M. d'Artagnan, and not to M. de Wardes.\n\nHe opened it and read as follows:\n\n\nDear M. d'Artagnan, It is wrong thus to neglect your friends,\nparticularly at the moment you are about to leave them for so long a\ntime. My brother-in-law and myself expected you yesterday and the day\nbefore, but in vain. Will it be the same this evening?\n\nYour very grateful, Milady Clarik\n\n\n\"That's all very simple,\" said d'Artagnan; \"I expected this letter. My\ncredit rises by the fall of that of the Comte de Wardes.\"\n\n\"And will you go?\" asked Kitty.\n\n\"Listen to me, my dear girl,\" said the Gascon, who sought for an excuse\nin his own eyes for breaking the promise he had made Athos; \"you\nmust understand it would be impolitic not to accept such a positive\ninvitation. Milady, not seeing me come again, would not be able to\nunderstand what could cause the interruption of my visits, and might\nsuspect something; who could say how far the vengeance of such a woman\nwould go?\"\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" said Kitty, \"you know how to represent things in such\na way that you are always in the right. You are going now to pay your\ncourt to her again, and if this time you succeed in pleasing her in your\nown name and with your own face, it will be much worse than before.\"\n\nInstinct made poor Kitty guess a part of what was to happen. d'Artagnan\nreassured her as well as he could, and promised to remain insensible to\nthe seductions of Milady.\n\nHe desired Kitty to tell her mistress that he could not be more grateful\nfor her kindnesses than he was, and that he would be obedient to her\norders. He did not dare to write for fear of not being able--to\nsuch experienced eyes as those of Milady--to disguise his writing\nsufficiently.\n\nAs nine o'clock sounded, d'Artagnan was at the Place Royale. It was\nevident that the servants who waited in the antechamber were warned, for\nas soon as d'Artagnan appeared, before even he had asked if Milady were\nvisible, one of them ran to announce him.\n\n\"Show him in,\" said Milady, in a quick tone, but so piercing that\nd'Artagnan heard her in the antechamber.\n\nHe was introduced.\n\n\"I am at home to nobody,\" said Milady; \"observe, to nobody.\" The servant\nwent out.\n\nD'Artagnan cast an inquiring glance at Milady. She was pale, and looked\nfatigued, either from tears or want of sleep. The number of lights had\nbeen intentionally diminished, but the young woman could not conceal the\ntraces of the fever which had devoured her for two days.\n\nD'Artagnan approached her with his usual gallantry. She then made an\nextraordinary effort to receive him, but never did a more distressed\ncountenance give the lie to a more amiable smile.\n\nTo the questions which d'Artagnan put concerning her health, she\nreplied, \"Bad, very bad.\"\n\n\"Then,\" replied he, \"my visit is ill-timed; you, no doubt, stand in need\nof repose, and I will withdraw.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" said Milady. \"On the contrary, stay, Monsieur d'Artagnan; your\nagreeable company will divert me.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" thought d'Artagnan. \"She has never been so kind before. On\nguard!\"\n\nMilady assumed the most agreeable air possible, and conversed with more\nthan her usual brilliancy. At the same time the fever, which for an\ninstant abandoned her, returned to give luster to her eyes, color to her\ncheeks, and vermillion to her lips. D'Artagnan was again in the presence\nof the Circe who had before surrounded him with her enchantments. His\nlove, which he believed to be extinct but which was only asleep, awoke\nagain in his heart. Milady smiled, and d'Artagnan felt that he could\ndamn himself for that smile. There was a moment at which he felt\nsomething like remorse.\n\nBy degrees, Milady became more communicative. She asked d'Artagnan if he\nhad a mistress.\n\n\"Alas!\" said d'Artagnan, with the most sentimental air he could assume,\n\"can you be cruel enough to put such a question to me--to me, who, from\nthe moment I saw you, have only breathed and sighed through you and for\nyou?\"\n\nMilady smiled with a strange smile.\n\n\"Then you love me?\" said she.\n\n\"Have I any need to tell you so? Have you not perceived it?\"\n\n\"It may be; but you know the more hearts are worth the capture, the more\ndifficult they are to be won.\"\n\n\"Oh, difficulties do not affright me,\" said d'Artagnan. \"I shrink before\nnothing but impossibilities.\"\n\n\"Nothing is impossible,\" replied Milady, \"to true love.\"\n\n\"Nothing, madame?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" replied Milady.\n\n\"The devil!\" thought d'Artagnan. \"The note is changed. Is she going to\nfall in love with me, by chance, this fair inconstant; and will she be\ndisposed to give me myself another sapphire like that which she gave me\nfor de Wardes?\"\n\nD'Artagnan rapidly drew his seat nearer to Milady's.\n\n\"Well, now,\" she said, \"let us see what you would do to prove this love\nof which you speak.\"\n\n\"All that could be required of me. Order; I am ready.\"\n\n\"For everything?\"\n\n\"For everything,\" cried d'Artagnan, who knew beforehand that he had not\nmuch to risk in engaging himself thus.\n\n\"Well, now let us talk a little seriously,\" said Milady, in her turn\ndrawing her armchair nearer to d'Artagnan's chair.\n\n\"I am all attention, madame,\" said he.\n\nMilady remained thoughtful and undecided for a moment; then, as if\nappearing to have formed a resolution, she said, \"I have an enemy.\"\n\n\"You, madame!\" said d'Artagnan, affecting surprise; \"is that possible,\nmy God?--good and beautiful as you are!\"\n\n\"A mortal enemy.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"An enemy who has insulted me so cruelly that between him and me it is\nwar to the death. May I reckon on you as an auxiliary?\"\n\nD'Artagnan at once perceived the ground which the vindictive creature\nwished to reach.\n\n\"You may, madame,\" said he, with emphasis. \"My arm and my life belong to\nyou, like my love.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Milady, \"since you are as generous as you are loving--\"\n\nShe stopped.\n\n\"Well?\" demanded d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Well,\" replied Milady, after a moment of silence, \"from the present\ntime, cease to talk of impossibilities.\"\n\n\"Do not overwhelm me with happiness,\" cried d'Artagnan, throwing himself\non his knees, and covering with kisses the hands abandoned to him.\n\n\"Avenge me of that infamous de Wardes,\" said Milady, between her teeth,\n\"and I shall soon know how to get rid of you--you double idiot, you\nanimated sword blade!\"\n\n\"Fall voluntarily into my arms, hypocritical and dangerous woman,\"\nsaid d'Artagnan, likewise to himself, \"after having abused me with such\neffrontery, and afterward I will laugh at you with him whom you wish me\nto kill.\"\n\nD'Artagnan lifted up his head.\n\n\"I am ready,\" said he.\n\n\"You have understood me, then, dear Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said Milady.\n\n\"I could interpret one of your looks.\"\n\n\"Then you would employ for me your arm which has already acquired so\nmuch renown?\"\n\n\"Instantly!\"\n\n\"But on my part,\" said Milady, \"how should I repay such a service? I\nknow these lovers. They are men who do nothing for nothing.\"\n\n\"You know the only reply that I desire,\" said d'Artagnan, \"the only one\nworthy of you and of me!\"\n\nAnd he drew nearer to her.\n\nShe scarcely resisted.\n\n\"Interested man!\" cried she, smiling.\n\n\"Ah,\" cried d'Artagnan, really carried away by the passion this woman\nhad the power to kindle in his heart, \"ah, that is because my happiness\nappears so impossible to me; and I have such fear that it should fly\naway from me like a dream that I pant to make a reality of it.\"\n\n\"Well, merit this pretended happiness, then!\"\n\n\"I am at your orders,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Quite certain?\" said Milady, with a last doubt.\n\n\"Only name to me the base man that has brought tears into your beautiful\neyes!\"\n\n\"Who told you that I had been weeping?\" said she.\n\n\"It appeared to me--\"\n\n\"Such women as I never weep,\" said Milady.\n\n\"So much the better! Come, tell me his name!\"\n\n\"Remember that his name is all my secret.\"\n\n\"Yet I must know his name.\"\n\n\"Yes, you must; see what confidence I have in you!\"\n\n\"You overwhelm me with joy. What is his name?\"\n\n\"You know him.\"\n\n\"Indeed.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"It is surely not one of my friends?\" replied d'Artagnan, affecting\nhesitation in order to make her believe him ignorant.\n\n\"If it were one of your friends you would hesitate, then?\" cried Milady;\nand a threatening glance darted from her eyes.\n\n\"Not if it were my own brother!\" cried d'Artagnan, as if carried away by\nhis enthusiasm.\n\nOur Gascon promised this without risk, for he knew all that was meant.\n\n\"I love your devotedness,\" said Milady.\n\n\"Alas, do you love nothing else in me?\" asked d'Artagnan.\n\n\"I love you also, YOU!\" said she, taking his hand.\n\nThe warm pressure made d'Artagnan tremble, as if by the touch that fever\nwhich consumed Milady attacked himself.\n\n\"You love me, you!\" cried he. \"Oh, if that were so, I should lose my\nreason!\"\n\nAnd he folded her in his arms. She made no effort to remove her lips\nfrom his kisses; only she did not respond to them. Her lips were cold;\nit appeared to d'Artagnan that he had embraced a statue.\n\nHe was not the less intoxicated with joy, electrified by love. He almost\nbelieved in the tenderness of Milady; he almost believed in the crime of\nde Wardes. If de Wardes had at that moment been under his hand, he would\nhave killed him.\n\nMilady seized the occasion.\n\n\"His name is--\" said she, in her turn.\n\n\"De Wardes; I know it,\" cried d'Artagnan.\n\n\"And how do you know it?\" asked Milady, seizing both his hands, and\nendeavoring to read with her eyes to the bottom of his heart.\n\nD'Artagnan felt he had allowed himself to be carried away, and that he\nhad committed an error.\n\n\"Tell me, tell me, tell me, I say,\" repeated Milady, \"how do you know\nit?\"\n\n\"How do I know it?\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I know it because yesterday Monsieur de Wardes, in a saloon where I\nwas, showed a ring which he said he had received from you.\"\n\n\"Wretch!\" cried Milady.\n\nThe epithet, as may be easily understood, resounded to the very bottom\nof d'Artagnan's heart.\n\n\"Well?\" continued she.\n\n\"Well, I will avenge you of this wretch,\" replied d'Artagnan, giving\nhimself the airs of Don Japhet of Armenia.\n\n\"Thanks, my brave friend!\" cried Milady; \"and when shall I be avenged?\"\n\n\"Tomorrow--immediately--when you please!\"\n\nMilady was about to cry out, \"Immediately,\" but she reflected that such\nprecipitation would not be very gracious toward d'Artagnan.\n\nBesides, she had a thousand precautions to take, a thousand counsels to\ngive to her defender, in order that he might avoid explanations with\nthe count before witnesses. All this was answered by an expression of\nd'Artagnan's. \"Tomorrow,\" said he, \"you will be avenged, or I shall be\ndead.\"\n\n\"No,\" said she, \"you will avenge me; but you will not be dead. He is a\ncoward.\"\n\n\"With women, perhaps; but not with men. I know something of him.\"\n\n\"But it seems you had not much reason to complain of your fortune in\nyour contest with him.\"\n\n\"Fortune is a courtesan; favorable yesterday, she may turn her back\ntomorrow.\"\n\n\"Which means that you now hesitate?\"\n\n\"No, I do not hesitate; God forbid! But would it be just to allow me to\ngo to a possible death without having given me at least something more\nthan hope?\"\n\nMilady answered by a glance which said, \"Is that all?--speak, then.\" And\nthen accompanying the glance with explanatory words, \"That is but too\njust,\" said she, tenderly.\n\n\"Oh, you are an angel!\" exclaimed the young man.\n\n\"Then all is agreed?\" said she.\n\n\"Except that which I ask of you, dear love.\"\n\n\"But when I assure you that you may rely on my tenderness?\"\n\n\"I cannot wait till tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Silence! I hear my brother. It will be useless for him to find you\nhere.\"\n\nShe rang the bell and Kitty appeared.\n\n\"Go out this way,\" said she, opening a small private door, \"and come\nback at eleven o'clock; we will then terminate this conversation. Kitty\nwill conduct you to my chamber.\"\n\nThe poor girl almost fainted at hearing these words.\n\n\"Well, mademoiselle, what are you thinking about, standing there like\na statue? Do as I bid you: show the chevalier out; and this evening at\neleven o'clock--you have heard what I said.\"\n\n\"It appears that these appointments are all made for eleven o'clock,\"\nthought d'Artagnan; \"that's a settled custom.\"\n\nMilady held out her hand to him, which he kissed tenderly.\n\n\"But,\" said he, as he retired as quickly as possible from the reproaches\nof Kitty, \"I must not play the fool. This woman is certainly a great\nliar. I must take care.\"\n\n\n\n\n37 MILADY'S SECRET\n\nD'Artagnan left the hotel instead of going up at once to Kitty's\nchamber, as she endeavored to persuade him to do--and that for two\nreasons: the first, because by this means he should escape reproaches,\nrecriminations, and prayers; the second, because he was not sorry to\nhave an opportunity of reading his own thoughts and endeavoring, if\npossible, to fathom those of this woman.\n\nWhat was most clear in the matter was that d'Artagnan loved Milady like\na madman, and that she did not love him at all. In an instant d'Artagnan\nperceived that the best way in which he could act would be to go home\nand write Milady a long letter, in which he would confess to her that\nhe and de Wardes were, up to the present moment absolutely the same, and\nthat consequently he could not undertake, without committing suicide,\nto kill the Comte de Wardes. But he also was spurred on by a ferocious\ndesire of vengeance. He wished to subdue this woman in his own name; and\nas this vengeance appeared to him to have a certain sweetness in it, he\ncould not make up his mind to renounce it.\n\nHe walked six or seven times round the Place Royale, turning at every\nten steps to look at the light in Milady's apartment, which was to be\nseen through the blinds. It was evident that this time the young woman\nwas not in such haste to retire to her apartment as she had been the\nfirst.\n\nAt length the light disappeared. With this light was extinguished the\nlast irresolution in the heart of d'Artagnan. He recalled to his mind\nthe details of the first night, and with a beating heart and a brain on\nfire he re-entered the hotel and flew toward Kitty's chamber.\n\nThe poor girl, pale as death and trembling in all her limbs, wished to\ndelay her lover; but Milady, with her ear on the watch, had heard the\nnoise d'Artagnan had made, and opening the door, said, \"Come in.\"\n\nAll this was of such incredible immodesty, of such monstrous effrontery,\nthat d'Artagnan could scarcely believe what he saw or what he heard. He\nimagined himself to be drawn into one of those fantastic intrigues one\nmeets in dreams. He, however, darted not the less quickly toward Milady,\nyielding to that magnetic attraction which the loadstone exercises over\niron.\n\nAs the door closed after them Kitty rushed toward it. Jealousy, fury,\noffended pride, all the passions in short that dispute the heart of\nan outraged woman in love, urged her to make a revelation; but she\nreflected that she would be totally lost if she confessed having\nassisted in such a machination, and above all, that d'Artagnan would\nalso be lost to her forever. This last thought of love counseled her to\nmake this last sacrifice.\n\nD'Artagnan, on his part, had gained the summit of all his wishes. It\nwas no longer a rival who was beloved; it was himself who was apparently\nbeloved. A secret voice whispered to him, at the bottom of his heart,\nthat he was but an instrument of vengeance, that he was only caressed\ntill he had given death; but pride, but self-love, but madness silenced\nthis voice and stifled its murmurs. And then our Gascon, with that large\nquantity of conceit which we know he possessed, compared himself with de\nWardes, and asked himself why, after all, he should not be beloved for\nhimself?\n\nHe was absorbed entirely by the sensations of the moment. Milady was\nno longer for him that woman of fatal intentions who had for a moment\nterrified him; she was an ardent, passionate mistress, abandoning\nherself to love which she also seemed to feel. Two hours thus glided\naway. When the transports of the two lovers were calmer, Milady, who\nhad not the same motives for forgetfulness that d'Artagnan had, was the\nfirst to return to reality, and asked the young man if the means which\nwere on the morrow to bring on the encounter between him and de Wardes\nwere already arranged in his mind.\n\nBut d'Artagnan, whose ideas had taken quite another course, forgot\nhimself like a fool, and answered gallantly that it was too late to\nthink about duels and sword thrusts.\n\nThis coldness toward the only interests that occupied her mind terrified\nMilady, whose questions became more pressing.\n\nThen d'Artagnan, who had never seriously thought of this impossible\nduel, endeavored to turn the conversation; but he could not succeed.\nMilady kept him within the limits she had traced beforehand with her\nirresistible spirit and her iron will.\n\nD'Artagnan fancied himself very cunning when advising Milady to\nrenounce, by pardoning de Wardes, the furious projects she had formed.\n\nBut at the first word the young woman started, and exclaimed in a\nsharp, bantering tone, which sounded strangely in the darkness, \"Are you\nafraid, dear Monsieur d'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"You cannot think so, dear love!\" replied d'Artagnan; \"but now, suppose\nthis poor Comte de Wardes were less guilty than you think him?\"\n\n\"At all events,\" said Milady, seriously, \"he has deceived me, and from\nthe moment he deceived me, he merited death.\"\n\n\"He shall die, then, since you condemn him!\" said d'Artagnan, in so firm\na tone that it appeared to Milady an undoubted proof of devotion. This\nreassured her.\n\nWe cannot say how long the night seemed to Milady, but d'Artagnan\nbelieved it to be hardly two hours before the daylight peeped through\nthe window blinds, and invaded the chamber with its paleness. Seeing\nd'Artagnan about to leave her, Milady recalled his promise to avenge her\non the Comte de Wardes.\n\n\"I am quite ready,\" said d'Artagnan; \"but in the first place I should\nlike to be certain of one thing.\"\n\n\"And what is that?\" asked Milady.\n\n\"That is, whether you really love me?\"\n\n\"I have given you proof of that, it seems to me.\"\n\n\"And I am yours, body and soul!\"\n\n\"Thanks, my brave lover; but as you are satisfied of my love, you must,\nin your turn, satisfy me of yours. Is it not so?\"\n\n\"Certainly; but if you love me as much as you say,\" replied d'Artagnan,\n\"do you not entertain a little fear on my account?\"\n\n\"What have I to fear?\"\n\n\"Why, that I may be dangerously wounded--killed even.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" cried Milady, \"you are such a valiant man, and such an\nexpert swordsman.\"\n\n\"You would not, then, prefer a method,\" resumed d'Artagnan, \"which would\nequally avenge you while rendering the combat useless?\"\n\nMilady looked at her lover in silence. The pale light of the first rays\nof day gave to her clear eyes a strangely frightful expression.\n\n\"Really,\" said she, \"I believe you now begin to hesitate.\"\n\n\"No, I do not hesitate; but I really pity this poor Comte de Wardes,\nsince you have ceased to love him. I think that a man must be so\nseverely punished by the loss of your love that he stands in need of no\nother chastisement.\"\n\n\"Who told you that I loved him?\" asked Milady, sharply.\n\n\"At least, I am now at liberty to believe, without too much fatuity,\nthat you love another,\" said the young man, in a caressing tone, \"and I\nrepeat that I am really interested for the count.\"\n\n\"You?\" asked Milady.\n\n\"Yes, I.\"\n\n\"And why YOU?\"\n\n\"Because I alone know--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"That he is far from being, or rather having been, so guilty toward you\nas he appears.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Milady, in an anxious tone; \"explain yourself, for I\nreally cannot tell what you mean.\"\n\nAnd she looked at d'Artagnan, who embraced her tenderly, with eyes which\nseemed to burn themselves away.\n\n\"Yes; I am a man of honor,\" said d'Artagnan, determined to come to an\nend, \"and since your love is mine, and I am satisfied I possess it--for\nI do possess it, do I not?\"\n\n\"Entirely; go on.\"\n\n\"Well, I feel as if transformed--a confession weighs on my mind.\"\n\n\"A confession!\"\n\n\"If I had the least doubt of your love I would not make it, but you love\nme, my beautiful mistress, do you not?\"\n\n\"Without doubt.\"\n\n\"Then if through excess of love I have rendered myself culpable toward\nyou, you will pardon me?\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\nD'Artagnan tried with his sweetest smile to touch his lips to Milady's,\nbut she evaded him.\n\n\"This confession,\" said she, growing paler, \"what is this confession?\"\n\n\"You gave de Wardes a meeting on Thursday last in this very room, did\nyou not?\"\n\n\"No, no! It is not true,\" said Milady, in a tone of voice so firm, and\nwith a countenance so unchanged, that if d'Artagnan had not been in such\nperfect possession of the fact, he would have doubted.\n\n\"Do not lie, my angel,\" said d'Artagnan, smiling; \"that would be\nuseless.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? Speak! you kill me.\"\n\n\"Be satisfied; you are not guilty toward me, and I have already pardoned\nyou.\"\n\n\"What next? what next?\"\n\n\"De Wardes cannot boast of anything.\"\n\n\"How is that? You told me yourself that that ring--\"\n\n\"That ring I have! The Comte de Wardes of Thursday and the d'Artagnan of\ntoday are the same person.\"\n\nThe imprudent young man expected a surprise, mixed with shame--a slight\nstorm which would resolve itself into tears; but he was strangely\ndeceived, and his error was not of long duration.\n\nPale and trembling, Milady repulsed d'Artagnan's attempted embrace by a\nviolent blow on the chest, as she sprang out of bed.\n\nIt was almost broad daylight.\n\nD'Artagnan detained her by her night dress of fine India linen, to\nimplore her pardon; but she, with a strong movement, tried to escape.\nThen the cambric was torn from her beautiful shoulders; and on one of\nthose lovely shoulders, round and white, d'Artagnan recognized, with\ninexpressible astonishment, the FLEUR-DE-LIS--that indelible mark which\nthe hand of the infamous executioner had imprinted.\n\n\"Great God!\" cried d'Artagnan, loosing his hold of her dress, and\nremaining mute, motionless, and frozen.\n\nBut Milady felt herself denounced even by his terror. He had doubtless\nseen all. The young man now knew her secret, her terrible secret--the\nsecret she concealed even from her maid with such care, the secret of\nwhich all the world was ignorant, except himself.\n\nShe turned upon him, no longer like a furious woman, but like a wounded\npanther.\n\n\"Ah, wretch!\" cried she, \"you have basely betrayed me, and still more,\nyou have my secret! You shall die.\"\n\nAnd she flew to a little inlaid casket which stood upon the dressing\ntable, opened it with a feverish and trembling hand, drew from it a\nsmall poniard, with a golden haft and a sharp thin blade, and then threw\nherself with a bound upon d'Artagnan.\n\nAlthough the young man was brave, as we know, he was terrified at that\nwild countenance, those terribly dilated pupils, those pale cheeks, and\nthose bleeding lips. He recoiled to the other side of the room as he\nwould have done from a serpent which was crawling toward him, and\nhis sword coming in contact with his nervous hand, he drew it almost\nunconsciously from the scabbard. But without taking any heed of the\nsword, Milady endeavored to get near enough to him to stab him, and did\nnot stop till she felt the sharp point at her throat.\n\nShe then tried to seize the sword with her hands; but d'Artagnan kept\nit free from her grasp, and presenting the point, sometimes at her eyes,\nsometimes at her breast, compelled her to glide behind the bedstead,\nwhile he aimed at making his retreat by the door which led to Kitty's\napartment.\n\nMilady during this time continued to strike at him with horrible fury,\nscreaming in a formidable way.\n\nAs all this, however, bore some resemblance to a duel, d'Artagnan began\nto recover himself little by little.\n\n\"Well, beautiful lady, very well,\" said he; \"but, PARDIEU, if you don't\ncalm yourself, I will design a second FLEUR-DE-LIS upon one of those\npretty cheeks!\"\n\n\"Scoundrel, infamous scoundrel!\" howled Milady.\n\nBut d'Artagnan, still keeping on the defensive, drew near to Kitty's\ndoor. At the noise they made, she in overturning the furniture in her\nefforts to get at him, he in screening himself behind the furniture\nto keep out of her reach, Kitty opened the door. D'Artagnan, who had\nunceasingly maneuvered to gain this point, was not at more than three\npaces from it. With one spring he flew from the chamber of Milady into\nthat of the maid, and quick as lightning, he slammed to the door, and\nplaced all his weight against it, while Kitty pushed the bolts.\n\nThen Milady attempted to tear down the doorcase, with a strength\napparently above that of a woman; but finding she could not accomplish\nthis, she in her fury stabbed at the door with her poniard, the point of\nwhich repeatedly glittered through the wood. Every blow was accompanied\nwith terrible imprecations.\n\n\"Quick, Kitty, quick!\" said d'Artagnan, in a low voice, as soon as the\nbolts were fast, \"let me get out of the hotel; for if we leave her time\nto turn round, she will have me killed by the servants.\"\n\n\"But you can't go out so,\" said Kitty; \"you are naked.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said d'Artagnan, then first thinking of the costume he\nfound himself in, \"that's true. But dress me as well as you are able,\nonly make haste; think, my dear girl, it's life and death!\"\n\nKitty was but too well aware of that. In a turn of the hand she muffled\nhim up in a flowered robe, a large hood, and a cloak. She gave him some\nslippers, in which he placed his naked feet, and then conducted him down\nthe stairs. It was time. Milady had already rung her bell, and roused\nthe whole hotel. The porter was drawing the cord at the moment Milady\ncried from her window, \"Don't open!\"\n\nThe young man fled while she was still threatening him with an impotent\ngesture. The moment she lost sight of him, Milady tumbled fainting into\nher chamber.\n\n\n\n\n38 HOW, WITHOUT INCOMMODING HIMSELF, ATHOS PROCURES HIS EQUIPMENT\n\nD'Artagnan was so completely bewildered that without taking any heed of\nwhat might become of Kitty he ran at full speed across half Paris, and\ndid not stop till he came to Athos's door. The confusion of his mind,\nthe terror which spurred him on, the cries of some of the patrol\nwho started in pursuit of him, and the hooting of the people who,\nnotwithstanding the early hour, were going to their work, only made him\nprecipitate his course.\n\nHe crossed the court, ran up the two flights to Athos's apartment, and\nknocked at the door enough to break it down.\n\nGrimaud came, rubbing his half-open eyes, to answer this noisy summons,\nand d'Artagnan sprang with such violence into the room as nearly to\noverturn the astonished lackey.\n\nIn spite of his habitual silence, the poor lad this time found his\nspeech.\n\n\"Holloa, there!\" cried he; \"what do you want, you strumpet? What's your\nbusiness here, you hussy?\"\n\nD'Artagnan threw off his hood, and disengaged his hands from the folds\nof the cloak. At sight of the mustaches and the naked sword, the poor\ndevil perceived he had to deal with a man. He then concluded it must be\nan assassin.\n\n\"Help! murder! help!\" cried he.\n\n\"Hold your tongue, you stupid fellow!\" said the young man; \"I am\nd'Artagnan; don't you know me? Where is your master?\"\n\n\"You, Monsieur d'Artagnan!\" cried Grimaud, \"impossible.\"\n\n\"Grimaud,\" said Athos, coming out of his apartment in a dressing gown,\n\"Grimaud, I thought I heard you permitting yourself to speak?\"\n\n\"Ah, monsieur, it is--\"\n\n\"Silence!\"\n\nGrimaud contented himself with pointing d'Artagnan out to his master\nwith his finger.\n\nAthos recognized his comrade, and phlegmatic as he was, he burst into\na laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before\nhis eyes--petticoats falling over his shoes, sleeves tucked up, and\nmustaches stiff with agitation.\n\n\"Don't laugh, my friend!\" cried d'Artagnan; \"for heaven's sake, don't\nlaugh, for upon my soul, it's no laughing matter!\"\n\nAnd he pronounced these words with such a solemn air and with such a\nreal appearance of terror, that Athos eagerly seized his hand, crying,\n\"Are you wounded, my friend? How pale you are!\"\n\n\"No, but I have just met with a terrible adventure! Are you alone,\nAthos?\"\n\n\"PARBLEU! whom do you expect to find with me at this hour?\"\n\n\"Well, well!\" and d'Artagnan rushed into Athos's chamber.\n\n\"Come, speak!\" said the latter, closing the door and bolting it, that\nthey might not be disturbed. \"Is the king dead? Have you killed the\ncardinal? You are quite upset! Come, come, tell me; I am dying with\ncuriosity and uneasiness!\"\n\n\"Athos,\" said d'Artagnan, getting rid of his female garments, and\nappearing in his shirt, \"prepare yourself to hear an incredible, an\nunheard-of story.\"\n\n\"Well, but put on this dressing gown first,\" said the Musketeer to his\nfriend.\n\nD'Artagnan donned the robe as quickly as he could, mistaking one sleeve\nfor the other, so greatly was he still agitated.\n\n\"Well?\" said Athos.\n\n\"Well,\" replied d'Artagnan, bending his mouth to Athos's ear, and\nlowering his voice, \"Milady is marked with a FLEUR-DE-LIS upon her\nshoulder!\"\n\n\"Ah!\" cried the Musketeer, as if he had received a ball in his heart.\n\n\"Let us see,\" said d'Artagnan. \"Are you SURE that the OTHER is dead?\"\n\n\"THE OTHER?\" said Athos, in so stifled a voice that d'Artagnan scarcely\nheard him.\n\n\"Yes, she of whom you told me one day at Amiens.\"\n\nAthos uttered a groan, and let his head sink on his hands.\n\n\"This is a woman of twenty-six or twenty-eight years.\"\n\n\"Fair,\" said Athos, \"is she not?\"\n\n\"Very.\"\n\n\"Blue and clear eyes, of a strange brilliancy, with black eyelids and\neyebrows?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Tall, well-made? She has lost a tooth, next to the eyetooth on the\nleft?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"The FLEUR-DE-LIS is small, rosy in color, and looks as if efforts had\nbeen made to efface it by the application of poultices?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But you say she is English?\"\n\n\"She is called Milady, but she may be French. Lord de Winter is only her\nbrother-in-law.\"\n\n\"I will see her, d'Artagnan!\"\n\n\"Beware, Athos, beware. You tried to kill her; she is a woman to return\nyou the like, and not to fail.\"\n\n\"She will not dare to say anything; that would be to denounce herself.\"\n\n\"She is capable of anything or everything. Did you ever see her\nfurious?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Athos.\n\n\"A tigress, a panther! Ah, my dear Athos, I am greatly afraid I have\ndrawn a terrible vengeance on both of us!\"\n\nD'Artagnan then related all--the mad passion of Milady and her menaces\nof death.\n\n\"You are right; and upon my soul, I would give my life for a hair,\" said\nAthos. \"Fortunately, the day after tomorrow we leave Paris. We are going\naccording to all probability to La Rochelle, and once gone--\"\n\n\"She will follow you to the end of the world, Athos, if she recognizes\nyou. Let her, then, exhaust her vengeance on me alone!\"\n\n\"My dear friend, of what consequence is it if she kills me?\" said Athos.\n\"Do you, perchance, think I set any great store by life?\"\n\n\"There is something horribly mysterious under all this, Athos; this\nwoman is one of the cardinal's spies, I am sure of that.\"\n\n\"In that case, take care! If the cardinal does not hold you in high\nadmiration for the affair of London, he entertains a great hatred for\nyou; but as, considering everything, he cannot accuse you openly, and\nas hatred must be satisfied, particularly when it's a cardinal's hatred,\ntake care of yourself. If you go out, do not go out alone; when you\neat, use every precaution. Mistrust everything, in short, even your own\nshadow.\"\n\n\"Fortunately,\" said d'Artagnan, \"all this will be only necessary till\nafter tomorrow evening, for when once with the army, we shall have, I\nhope, only men to dread.\"\n\n\"In the meantime,\" said Athos, \"I renounce my plan of seclusion, and\nwherever you go, I will go with you. You must return to the Rue des\nFossoyeurs; I will accompany you.\"\n\n\"But however near it may be,\" replied d'Artagnan, \"I cannot go thither\nin this guise.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said Athos, and he rang the bell.\n\nGrimaud entered.\n\nAthos made him a sign to go to d'Artagnan's residence, and bring\nback some clothes. Grimaud replied by another sign that he understood\nperfectly, and set off.\n\n\"All this will not advance your outfit,\" said Athos; \"for if I am not\nmistaken, you have left the best of your apparel with Milady, and she\nwill certainly not have the politeness to return it to you. Fortunately,\nyou have the sapphire.\"\n\n\"The jewel is yours, my dear Athos! Did you not tell me it was a family\njewel?\"\n\n\"Yes, my grandfather gave two thousand crowns for it, as he once told\nme. It formed part of the nuptial present he made his wife, and it is\nmagnificent. My mother gave it to me, and I, fool as I was, instead of\nkeeping the ring as a holy relic, gave it to this wretch.\"\n\n\"Then, my friend, take back this ring, to which I see you attach much\nvalue.\"\n\n\"I take back the ring, after it has passed through the hands of that\ninfamous creature? Never; that ring is defiled, d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Sell it, then.\"\n\n\"Sell a jewel which came from my mother! I vow I should consider it a\nprofanation.\"\n\n\"Pledge it, then; you can borrow at least a thousand crowns on it. With\nthat sum you can extricate yourself from your present difficulties; and\nwhen you are full of money again, you can redeem it, and take it back\ncleansed from its ancient stains, as it will have passed through the\nhands of usurers.\"\n\nAthos smiled.\n\n\"You are a capital companion, d'Artagnan,\" said be; \"your never-failing\ncheerfulness raises poor souls in affliction. Well, let us pledge the\nring, but upon one condition.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"That there shall be five hundred crowns for you, and five hundred\ncrowns for me.\"\n\n\"Don't dream it, Athos. I don't need the quarter of such a sum--I who am\nstill only in the Guards--and by selling my saddles, I shall procure it.\nWhat do I want? A horse for Planchet, that's all. Besides, you forget\nthat I have a ring likewise.\"\n\n\"To which you attach more value, it seems, than I do to mine; at least,\nI have thought so.\"\n\n\"Yes, for in any extreme circumstance it might not only extricate us\nfrom some great embarrassment, but even a great danger. It is not only a\nvaluable diamond, but it is an enchanted talisman.\"\n\n\"I don't at all understand you, but I believe all you say to be true.\nLet us return to my ring, or rather to yours. You shall take half the\nsum that will be advanced upon it, or I will throw it into the Seine;\nand I doubt, as was the case with Polycrates, whether any fish will be\nsufficiently complaisant to bring it back to us.\"\n\n\"Well, I will take it, then,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\nAt this moment Grimaud returned, accompanied by Planchet; the latter,\nanxious about his master and curious to know what had happened to him,\nhad taken advantage of the opportunity and brought the garments himself.\n\n\nd'Artagnan dressed himself, and Athos did the same. When the two were\nready to go out, the latter made Grimaud the sign of a man taking aim,\nand the lackey immediately took down his musketoon, and prepared to\nfollow his master.\n\nThey arrived without accident at the Rue des Fossoyeurs. Bonacieux was\nstanding at the door, and looked at d'Artagnan hatefully.\n\n\"Make haste, dear lodger,\" said he; \"there is a very pretty girl waiting\nfor you upstairs; and you know women don't like to be kept waiting.\"\n\n\"That's Kitty!\" said d'Artagnan to himself, and darted into the passage.\n\nSure enough! Upon the landing leading to the chamber, and crouching\nagainst the door, he found the poor girl, all in a tremble. As soon as\nshe perceived him, she cried, \"You have promised your protection; you\nhave promised to save me from her anger. Remember, it is you who have\nruined me!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, to be sure, Kitty,\" said d'Artagnan; \"be at ease, my girl.\nBut what happened after my departure?\"\n\n\"How can I tell!\" said Kitty. \"The lackeys were brought by the cries she\nmade. She was mad with passion. There exist no imprecations she did not\npour out against you. Then I thought she would remember it was through\nmy chamber you had penetrated hers, and that then she would suppose I\nwas your accomplice; so I took what little money I had and the best of\nmy things, and I got away.\n\n\"Poor dear girl! But what can I do with you? I am going away the day\nafter tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Do what you please, Monsieur Chevalier. Help me out of Paris; help me\nout of France!\"\n\n\"I cannot take you, however, to the siege of La Rochelle,\" aid\nd'Artagnan.\n\n\"No; but you can place me in one of the provinces with some lady of your\nacquaintance--in your own country, for instance.\"\n\n\"My dear little love! In my country the ladies do without chambermaids.\nBut stop! I can manage your business for you. Planchet, go and find\nAramis. Request him to come here directly. We have something very\nimportant to say to him.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Athos; \"but why not Porthos? I should have thought\nthat his duchess--\"\n\n\"Oh, Porthos's duchess is dressed by her husband's clerks,\" said\nd'Artagnan, laughing. \"Besides, Kitty would not like to live in the Rue\naux Ours. Isn't it so, Kitty?\"\n\n\"I do not care where I live,\" said Kitty, \"provided I am well concealed,\nand nobody knows where I am.\"\n\n\"Meanwhile, Kitty, when we are about to separate, and you are no longer\njealous of me--\"\n\n\"Monsieur Chevalier, far off or near,\" said Kitty, \"I shall always love\nyou.\"\n\n\"Where the devil will constancy niche itself next?\" murmured Athos.\n\n\"And I, also,\" said d'Artagnan, \"I also. I shall always love you;\nbe sure of that. But now answer me. I attach great importance to the\nquestion I am about to put to you. Did you never hear talk of a young\nwoman who was carried off one night?\"\n\n\"There, now! Oh, Monsieur Chevalier, do you love that woman still?\"\n\n\"No, no; it is one of my friends who loves her--Monsieur Athos, this\ngentleman here.\"\n\n\"I?\" cried Athos, with an accent like that of a man who perceives he is\nabout to tread upon an adder.\n\n\"You, to be sure!\" said d'Artagnan, pressing Athos's hand. \"You know\nthe interest we both take in this poor little Madame Bonacieux. Besides,\nKitty will tell nothing; will you, Kitty? You understand, my dear girl,\"\ncontinued d'Artagnan, \"she is the wife of that frightful baboon you saw\nat the door as you came in.\"\n\n\"Oh, my God! You remind me of my fright! If he should have known me\nagain!\"\n\n\"How? know you again? Did you ever see that man before?\"\n\n\"He came twice to Milady's.\"\n\n\"That's it. About what time?\"\n\n\"Why, about fifteen or eighteen days ago.\"\n\n\"Exactly so.\"\n\n\"And yesterday evening he came again.\"\n\n\"Yesterday evening?\"\n\n\"Yes, just before you came.\"\n\n\"My dear Athos, we are enveloped in a network of spies. And do you\nbelieve he knew you again, Kitty?\"\n\n\"I pulled down my hood as soon as I saw him, but perhaps it was too\nlate.\"\n\n\"Go down, Athos--he mistrusts you less than me--and see if he be still\nat his door.\"\n\nAthos went down and returned immediately.\n\n\"He has gone,\" said he, \"and the house door is shut.\"\n\n\"He has gone to make his report, and to say that all the pigeons are at\nthis moment in the dovecot.\"\n\n\"Well, then, let us all fly,\" said Athos, \"and leave nobody here but\nPlanchet to bring us news.\"\n\n\"A minute. Aramis, whom we have sent for!\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said Athos; \"we must wait for Aramis.\"\n\nAt that moment Aramis entered.\n\nThe matter was all explained to him, and the friends gave him to\nunderstand that among all his high connections he must find a place for\nKitty.\n\nAramis reflected for a minute, and then said, coloring, \"Will it be\nreally rendering you a service, d'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"I shall be grateful to you all my life.\"\n\n\"Very well. Madame de Bois-Tracy asked me, for one of her friends who\nresides in the provinces, I believe, for a trustworthy maid. If you can,\nmy dear d'Artagnan, answer for Mademoiselle-\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur, be assured that I shall be entirely devoted to the person\nwho will give me the means of quitting Paris.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Aramis, \"this falls out very well.\"\n\nHe placed himself at the table and wrote a little note which he sealed\nwith a ring, and gave the billet to Kitty.\n\n\"And now, my dear girl,\" said d'Artagnan, \"you know that it is not good\nfor any of us to be here. Therefore let us separate. We shall meet again\nin better days.\"\n\n\"And whenever we find each other, in whatever place it may be,\" said\nKitty, \"you will find me loving you as I love you today.\"\n\n\"Dicers' oaths!\" said Athos, while d'Artagnan went to conduct Kitty\ndownstairs.\n\nAn instant afterward the three young men separated, agreeing to meet\nagain at four o'clock with Athos, and leaving Planchet to guard the\nhouse.\n\nAramis returned home, and Athos and d'Artagnan busied themselves about\npledging the sapphire.\n\nAs the Gascon had foreseen, they easily obtained three hundred pistoles\non the ring. Still further, the Jew told them that if they would sell\nit to him, as it would make a magnificent pendant for earrings, he would\ngive five hundred pistoles for it.\n\nAthos and d'Artagnan, with the activity of two soldiers and the\nknowledge of two connoisseurs, hardly required three hours to purchase\nthe entire equipment of the Musketeer. Besides, Athos was very easy, and\na noble to his fingers' ends. When a thing suited him he paid the price\ndemanded, without thinking to ask for any abatement. D'Artagnan would\nhave remonstrated at this; but Athos put his hand upon his shoulder,\nwith a smile, and d'Artagnan understood that it was all very well for\nsuch a little Gascon gentleman as himself to drive a bargain, but not\nfor a man who had the bearing of a prince. The Musketeer met with a\nsuperb Andalusian horse, black as jet, nostrils of fire, legs clean\nand elegant, rising six years. He examined him, and found him sound and\nwithout blemish. They asked a thousand livres for him.\n\nHe might perhaps have been bought for less; but while d'Artagnan was\ndiscussing the price with the dealer, Athos was counting out the money\non the table.\n\nGrimaud had a stout, short Picard cob, which cost three hundred livres.\n\nBut when the saddle and arms for Grimaud were purchased, Athos had not\na sou left of his hundred and fifty pistoles. d'Artagnan offered his\nfriend a part of his share which he should return when convenient.\n\nBut Athos only replied to this proposal by shrugging his shoulders.\n\n\"How much did the Jew say he would give for the sapphire if he purchased\nit?\" said Athos.\n\n\"Five hundred pistoles.\"\n\n\"That is to say, two hundred more--a hundred pistoles for you and a\nhundred pistoles for me. Well, now, that would be a real fortune to us,\nmy friend; let us go back to the Jew's again.\"\n\n\"What! will you--\"\n\n\"This ring would certainly only recall very bitter remembrances; then we\nshall never be masters of three hundred pistoles to redeem it, so that\nwe really should lose two hundred pistoles by the bargain. Go and tell\nhim the ring is his, d'Artagnan, and bring back the two hundred pistoles\nwith you.\"\n\n\"Reflect, Athos!\"\n\n\"Ready money is needful for the present time, and we must learn how to\nmake sacrifices. Go, d'Artagnan, go; Grimaud will accompany you with his\nmusketoon.\"\n\nA half hour afterward, d'Artagnan returned with the two thousand livres,\nand without having met with any accident.\n\nIt was thus Athos found at home resources which he did not expect.\n\n\n\n\n39 A VISION\n\nAt four o'clock the four friends were all assembled with Athos. Their\nanxiety about their outfits had all disappeared, and each countenance\nonly preserved the expression of its own secret disquiet--for behind all\npresent happiness is concealed a fear for the future.\n\nSuddenly Planchet entered, bringing two letters for d'Artagnan.\n\nThe one was a little billet, genteelly folded, with a pretty seal in\ngreen wax on which was impressed a dove bearing a green branch.\n\nThe other was a large square epistle, resplendent with the terrible arms\nof his Eminence the cardinal duke.\n\nAt the sight of the little letter the heart of d'Artagnan bounded, for\nhe believed he recognized the handwriting, and although he had seen that\nwriting but once, the memory of it remained at the bottom of his heart.\n\nHe therefore seized the little epistle, and opened it eagerly.\n\n\n\"Be,\" said the letter, \"on Thursday next, at from six to seven o'clock\nin the evening, on the road to Chaillot, and look carefully into the\ncarriages that pass; but if you have any consideration for your own life\nor that of those who love you, do not speak a single word, do not make\na movement which may lead anyone to believe you have recognized her\nwho exposes herself to everything for the sake of seeing you but for an\ninstant.\"\n\nNo signature.\n\n\n\"That's a snare,\" said Athos; \"don't go, d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" replied d'Artagnan, \"I think I recognize the writing.\"\n\n\"It may be counterfeit,\" said Athos. \"Between six and seven o'clock the\nroad of Chaillot is quite deserted; you might as well go and ride in the\nforest of Bondy.\"\n\n\"But suppose we all go,\" said d'Artagnan; \"what the devil! They won't\ndevour us all four, four lackeys, horses, arms, and all!\"\n\n\"And besides, it will be a chance for displaying our new equipments,\"\nsaid Porthos.\n\n\"But if it is a woman who writes,\" said Aramis, \"and that woman desires\nnot to be seen, remember, you compromise her, d'Artagnan; which is not\nthe part of a gentleman.\"\n\n\"We will remain in the background,\" said Porthos, \"and he will advance\nalone.\"\n\n\"Yes; but a pistol shot is easily fired from a carriage which goes at a\ngallop.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said d'Artagnan, \"they will miss me; if they fire we will ride\nafter the carriage, and exterminate those who may be in it. They must be\nenemies.\"\n\n\"He is right,\" said Porthos; \"battle. Besides, we must try our own\narms.\"\n\n\"Bah, let us enjoy that pleasure,\" said Aramis, with his mild and\ncareless manner.\n\n\"As you please,\" said Athos.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said d'Artagnan, \"it is half past four, and we have\nscarcely time to be on the road of Chaillot by six.\"\n\n\"Besides, if we go out too late, nobody will see us,\" said Porthos, \"and\nthat will be a pity. Let us get ready, gentlemen.\"\n\n\"But this second letter,\" said Athos, \"you forget that; it appears to\nme, however, that the seal denotes that it deserves to be opened. For\nmy part, I declare, d'Artagnan, I think it of much more consequence than\nthe little piece of waste paper you have so cunningly slipped into your\nbosom.\"\n\nD'Artagnan blushed.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"let us see, gentlemen, what are his Eminence's\ncommands,\" and d'Artagnan unsealed the letter and read,\n\n\n\"M. d'Artagnan, of the king's Guards, company Dessessart, is expected at\nthe Palais-Cardinal this evening, at eight o'clock.\n\n\"La Houdiniere, CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS\"\n\n\n\"The devil!\" said Athos; \"here's a rendezvous much more serious than the\nother.\"\n\n\"I will go to the second after attending the first,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\"One is for seven o'clock, and the other for eight; there will be time\nfor both.\"\n\n\"Hum! I would not go at all,\" said Aramis. \"A gallant knight cannot\ndecline a rendezvous with a lady; but a prudent gentleman may excuse\nhimself from not waiting on his Eminence, particularly when he has\nreason to believe he is not invited to make his compliments.\"\n\n\"I am of Aramis's opinion,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" replied d'Artagnan, \"I have already received by Monsieur\nde Cavois a similar invitation from his Eminence. I neglected it, and on\nthe morrow a serious misfortune happened to me--Constance disappeared.\nWhatever may ensue, I will go.\"\n\n\"If you are determined,\" said Athos, \"do so.\"\n\n\"But the Bastille?\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Bah! you will get me out if they put me there,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"To be sure we will,\" replied Aramis and Porthos, with admirable\npromptness and decision, as if that were the simplest thing in the\nworld, \"to be sure we will get you out; but meantime, as we are to set\noff the day after tomorrow, you would do much better not to risk this\nBastille.\"\n\n\"Let us do better than that,\" said Athos; \"do not let us leave him\nduring the whole evening. Let each of us wait at a gate of the palace\nwith three Musketeers behind him; if we see a close carriage, at all\nsuspicious in appearance, come out, let us fall upon it. It is a long\ntime since we have had a skirmish with the Guards of Monsieur the\nCardinal; Monsieur de Treville must think us dead.\"\n\n\"To a certainty, Athos,\" said Aramis, \"you were meant to be a general of\nthe army! What do you think of the plan, gentlemen?\"\n\n\"Admirable!\" replied the young men in chorus.\n\n\"Well,\" said Porthos, \"I will run to the hotel, and engage our comrades\nto hold themselves in readiness by eight o'clock; the rendezvous, the\nPlace du Palais-Cardinal. Meantime, you see that the lackeys saddle the\nhorses.\"\n\n\"I have no horse,\" said d'Artagnan; \"but that is of no consequence, I\ncan take one of Monsieur de Treville's.\"\n\n\"That is not worth while,\" said Aramis, \"you can have one of mine.\"\n\n\"One of yours! how many have you, then?\" asked d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Three,\" replied Aramis, smiling.\n\n\"Certes,\" cried Athos, \"you are the best-mounted poet of France or\nNavarre.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear Aramis, you don't want three horses? I cannot comprehend\nwhat induced you to buy three!\"\n\n\"Therefore I only purchased two,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"The third, then, fell from the clouds, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No, the third was brought to me this very morning by a groom out of\nlivery, who would not tell me in whose service he was, and who said he\nhad received orders from his master.\"\n\n\"Or his mistress,\" interrupted d'Artagnan.\n\n\"That makes no difference,\" said Aramis, coloring; \"and who affirmed, as\nI said, that he had received orders from his master or mistress to place\nthe horse in my stable, without informing me whence it came.\"\n\n\"It is only to poets that such things happen,\" said Athos, gravely.\n\n\"Well, in that case, we can manage famously,\" said d'Artagnan; \"which of\nthe two horses will you ride--that which you bought or the one that was\ngiven to you?\"\n\n\"That which was given to me, assuredly. You cannot for a moment imagine,\nd'Artagnan, that I would commit such an offense toward--\"\n\n\"The unknown giver,\" interrupted d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Or the mysterious benefactress,\" said Athos.\n\n\"The one you bought will then become useless to you?\"\n\n\"Nearly so.\"\n\n\"And you selected it yourself?\"\n\n\"With the greatest care. The safety of the horseman, you know, depends\nalmost always upon the goodness of his horse.\"\n\n\"Well, transfer it to me at the price it cost you?\"\n\n\"I was going to make you the offer, my dear d'Artagnan, giving you all\nthe time necessary for repaying me such a trifle.\"\n\n\"How much did it cost you?\"\n\n\"Eight hundred livres.\"\n\n\"Here are forty double pistoles, my dear friend,\" said d'Artagnan,\ntaking the sum from his pocket; \"I know that is the coin in which you\nwere paid for your poems.\"\n\n\"You are rich, then?\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Rich? Richest, my dear fellow!\"\n\nAnd d'Artagnan chinked the remainder of his pistoles in his pocket.\n\n\"Send your saddle, then, to the hotel of the Musketeers, and your horse\ncan be brought back with ours.\"\n\n\"Very well; but it is already five o'clock, so make haste.\"\n\nA quarter of an hour afterward Porthos appeared at the end of the Rue\nFerou on a very handsome genet. Mousqueton followed him upon an Auvergne\nhorse, small but very handsome. Porthos was resplendent with joy and\npride.\n\nAt the same time, Aramis made his appearance at the other end of the\nstreet upon a superb English charger. Bazin followed him upon a roan,\nholding by the halter a vigorous Mecklenburg horse; this was d'Artagnan's\nmount.\n\nThe two Musketeers met at the gate. Athos and d'Artagnan watched their\napproach from the window.\n\n\"The devil!\" cried Aramis, \"you have a magnificent horse there,\nPorthos.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Porthos, \"it is the one that ought to have been sent to\nme at first. A bad joke of the husband's substituted the other; but the\nhusband has been punished since, and I have obtained full satisfaction.\"\n\nPlanchet and Grimaud appeared in their turn, leading their masters'\nsteeds. D'Artagnan and Athos put themselves into saddle with their\ncompanions, and all four set forward; Athos upon a horse he owed to a\nwoman, Aramis on a horse he owed to his mistress, Porthos on a horse he\nowed to his procurator's wife, and d'Artagnan on a horse he owed to his\ngood fortune--the best mistress possible.\n\nThe lackeys followed.\n\nAs Porthos had foreseen, the cavalcade produced a good effect; and if\nMme. Coquenard had met Porthos and seen what a superb appearance he\nmade upon his handsome Spanish genet, she would not have regretted the\nbleeding she had inflicted upon the strongbox of her husband.\n\nNear the Louvre the four friends met with M. de Treville, who was\nreturning from St. Germain; he stopped them to offer his compliments\nupon their appointments, which in an instant drew round them a hundred\ngapers.\n\nD'Artagnan profited by the circumstance to speak to M. de Treville of\nthe letter with the great red seal and the cardinal's arms. It is well\nunderstood that he did not breathe a word about the other.\n\nM. de Treville approved of the resolution he had adopted, and assured\nhim that if on the morrow he did not appear, he himself would undertake\nto find him, let him be where he might.\n\nAt this moment the clock of La Samaritaine struck six; the four friends\npleaded an engagement, and took leave of M. de Treville.\n\nA short gallop brought them to the road of Chaillot; the day began to\ndecline, carriages were passing and repassing. d'Artagnan, keeping at\nsome distance from his friends, darted a scrutinizing glance into every\ncarriage that appeared, but saw no face with which he was acquainted.\n\nAt length, after waiting a quarter of an hour and just as twilight was\nbeginning to thicken, a carriage appeared, coming at a quick pace on\nthe road of Sevres. A presentiment instantly told d'Artagnan that this\ncarriage contained the person who had appointed the rendezvous; the\nyoung man was himself astonished to find his heart beat so violently.\nAlmost instantly a female head was put out at the window, with two\nfingers placed upon her mouth, either to enjoin silence or to send him a\nkiss. D'Artagnan uttered a slight cry of joy; this woman, or rather this\napparition--for the carriage passed with the rapidity of a vision--was\nMme. Bonacieux.\n\nBy an involuntary movement and in spite of the injunction given,\nd'Artagnan put his horse into a gallop, and in a few strides overtook\nthe carriage; but the window was hermetically closed, the vision had\ndisappeared.\n\nD'Artagnan then remembered the injunction: \"If you value your own life\nor that of those who love you, remain motionless, and as if you had seen\nnothing.\"\n\nHe stopped, therefore, trembling not for himself but for the poor woman\nwho had evidently exposed herself to great danger by appointing this\nrendezvous.\n\nThe carriage pursued its way, still going at a great pace, till it\ndashed into Paris, and disappeared.\n\nD'Artagnan remained fixed to the spot, astounded and not knowing what to\nthink. If it was Mme. Bonacieux and if she was returning to Paris, why\nthis fugitive rendezvous, why this simple exchange of a glance, why this\nlost kiss? If, on the other side, it was not she--which was still\nquite possible--for the little light that remained rendered a mistake\neasy--might it not be the commencement of some plot against him through\nthe allurement of this woman, for whom his love was known?\n\nHis three companions joined him. All had plainly seen a woman's\nhead appear at the window, but none of them, except Athos, knew Mme.\nBonacieux. The opinion of Athos was that it was indeed she; but less\npreoccupied by that pretty face than d'Artagnan, he had fancied he saw a\nsecond head, a man's head, inside the carriage.\n\n\"If that be the case,\" said d'Artagnan, \"they are doubtless transporting\nher from one prison to another. But what can they intend to do with the\npoor creature, and how shall I ever meet her again?\"\n\n\"Friend,\" said Athos, gravely, \"remember that it is the dead alone with\nwhom we are not likely to meet again on this earth. You know something\nof that, as well as I do, I think. Now, if your mistress is not dead,\nif it is she we have just seen, you will meet with her again some day or\nother. And perhaps, my God!\" added he, with that misanthropic tone which\nwas peculiar to him, \"perhaps sooner than you wish.\"\n\nHalf past seven had sounded. The carriage had been twenty minutes behind\nthe time appointed. D'Artagnan's friends reminded him that he had a\nvisit to pay, but at the same time bade him observe that there was yet\ntime to retract.\n\nBut d'Artagnan was at the same time impetuous and curious. He had made\nup his mind that he would go to the Palais-Cardinal, and that he would\nlearn what his Eminence had to say to him. Nothing could turn him from\nhis purpose.\n\nThey reached the Rue St. Honore, and in the Place du Palais-Cardinal\nthey found the twelve invited Musketeers, walking about in expectation\nof their comrades. There only they explained to them the matter in hand.\n\nD'Artagnan was well known among the honorable corps of the king's\nMusketeers, in which it was known he would one day take his place;\nhe was considered beforehand as a comrade. It resulted from these\nantecedents that everyone entered heartily into the purpose for which\nthey met; besides, it would not be unlikely that they would have an\nopportunity of playing either the cardinal or his people an ill turn,\nand for such expeditions these worthy gentlemen were always ready.\n\nAthos divided them into three groups, assumed the command of one, gave\nthe second to Aramis, and the third to Porthos; and then each group went\nand took their watch near an entrance.\n\nD'Artagnan, on his part, entered boldly at the principal gate.\n\nAlthough he felt himself ably supported, the young man was not without a\nlittle uneasiness as he ascended the great staircase, step by step. His\nconduct toward Milady bore a strong resemblance to treachery, and he was\nvery suspicious of the political relations which existed between that\nwoman and the cardinal. Still further, de Wardes, whom he had treated\nso ill, was one of the tools of his Eminence; and d'Artagnan knew that\nwhile his Eminence was terrible to his enemies, he was strongly attached\nto his friends.\n\n\"If de Wardes has related all our affair to the cardinal, which is\nnot to be doubted, and if he has recognized me, as is probable, I may\nconsider myself almost as a condemned man,\" said d'Artagnan, shaking his\nhead. \"But why has he waited till now? That's all plain enough. Milady\nhas laid her complaints against me with that hypocritical grief which\nrenders her so interesting, and this last offense has made the cup\noverflow.\"\n\n\"Fortunately,\" added he, \"my good friends are down yonder, and they\nwill not allow me to be carried away without a struggle. Nevertheless,\nMonsieur de Treville's company of Musketeers alone cannot maintain a\nwar against the cardinal, who disposes of the forces of all France,\nand before whom the queen is without power and the king without\nwill. d'Artagnan, my friend, you are brave, you are prudent, you have\nexcellent qualities; but the women will ruin you!\"\n\nHe came to this melancholy conclusion as he entered the antechamber. He\nplaced his letter in the hands of the usher on duty, who led him into\nthe waiting room and passed on into the interior of the palace.\n\nIn this waiting room were five or six of the cardinals Guards, who\nrecognized d'Artagnan, and knowing that it was he who had wounded\nJussac, they looked upon him with a smile of singular meaning.\n\nThis smile appeared to d'Artagnan to be of bad augury. Only, as our\nGascon was not easily intimidated--or rather, thanks to a great pride\nnatural to the men of his country, he did not allow one easily to\nsee what was passing in his mind when that which was passing at all\nresembled fear--he placed himself haughtily in front of Messieurs the\nGuards, and waited with his hand on his hip, in an attitude by no means\ndeficient in majesty.\n\nThe usher returned and made a sign to d'Artagnan to follow him. It\nappeared to the young man that the Guards, on seeing him depart,\nchuckled among themselves.\n\nHe traversed a corridor, crossed a grand saloon, entered a library, and\nfound himself in the presence of a man seated at a desk and writing.\n\nThe usher introduced him, and retired without speaking a word.\nD'Artagnan remained standing and examined this man.\n\nD'Artagnan at first believed that he had to do with some judge examining\nhis papers; but he perceived that the man at the desk wrote, or rather\ncorrected, lines of unequal length, scanning the words on his fingers.\nHe saw then that he was with a poet. At the end of an instant the poet\nclosed his manuscript, upon the cover of which was written \"Mirame, a\nTragedy in Five Acts,\" and raised his head.\n\nD'Artagnan recognized the cardinal.\n\n\n\n\n40 A TERRIBLE VISION\n\nThe cardinal leaned his elbow on his manuscript, his cheek upon his\nhand, and looked intently at the young man for a moment. No one had a\nmore searching eye than the Cardinal de Richelieu, and d'Artagnan felt\nthis glance run through his veins like a fever.\n\nHe however kept a good countenance, holding his hat in his hand and\nawaiting the good pleasure of his Eminence, without too much assurance,\nbut also without too much humility.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the cardinal, \"are you a d'Artagnan from Bearn?\"\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur,\" replied the young man.\n\n\"There are several branches of the d'Artagnans at Tarbes and in its\nenvirons,\" said the cardinal; \"to which do you belong?\"\n\n\"I am the son of him who served in the Religious Wars under the great\nKing Henry, the father of his gracious Majesty.\"\n\n\"That is well. It is you who set out seven or eight months ago from your\ncountry to seek your fortune in the capital?\"\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"You came through Meung, where something befell you. I don't very well\nknow what, but still something.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" said d'Artagnan, \"this was what happened to me--\"\n\n\"Never mind, never mind!\" resumed the cardinal, with a smile which\nindicated that he knew the story as well as he who wished to relate it.\n\"You were recommended to Monsieur de Treville, were you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur; but in that unfortunate affair at Meung--\"\n\n\"The letter was lost,\" replied his Eminence; \"yes, I know that. But\nMonsieur de Treville is a skilled physiognomist, who knows men at first\nsight; and he placed you in the company of his brother-in-law, Monsieur\nDessessart, leaving you to hope that one day or other you should enter\nthe Musketeers.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur is correctly informed,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Since that time many things have happened to you. You were walking one\nday behind the Chartreux, when it would have been better if you had been\nelsewhere. Then you took with your friends a journey to the waters of\nForges; they stopped on the road, but you continued yours. That is all\nvery simple: you had business in England.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" said d'Artagnan, quite confused, \"I went--\"\n\n\"Hunting at Windsor, or elsewhere--that concerns nobody. I know, because\nit is my office to know everything. On your return you were received by\nan august personage, and I perceive with pleasure that you preserve the\nsouvenir she gave you.\"\n\nD'Artagnan placed his hand upon the queen's diamond, which he wore, and\nquickly turned the stone inward; but it was too late.\n\n\"The day after that, you received a visit from Cavois,\" resumed the\ncardinal. \"He went to desire you to come to the palace. You have not\nreturned that visit, and you were wrong.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur, I feared I had incurred disgrace with your Eminence.\"\n\n\"How could that be, monsieur? Could you incur my displeasure by having\nfollowed the orders of your superiors with more intelligence and courage\nthan another would have done? It is the people who do not obey that I\npunish, and not those who, like you, obey--but too well. As a proof,\nremember the date of the day on which I had you bidden to come to me,\nand seek in your memory for what happened to you that very night.\"\n\nThat was the very evening when the abduction of Mme. Bonacieux took\nplace. D'Artagnan trembled; and he likewise recollected that during the\npast half hour the poor woman had passed close to him, without doubt\ncarried away by the same power that had caused her disappearance.\n\n\"In short,\" continued the cardinal, \"as I have heard nothing of you for\nsome time past, I wished to know what you were doing. Besides, you owe\nme some thanks. You must yourself have remarked how much you have been\nconsidered in all the circumstances.\"\n\nD'Artagnan bowed with respect.\n\n\"That,\" continued the cardinal, \"arose not only from a feeling of\nnatural equity, but likewise from a plan I have marked out with respect\nto you.\"\n\nD'Artagnan became more and more astonished.\n\n\"I wished to explain this plan to you on the day you received my first\ninvitation; but you did not come. Fortunately, nothing is lost by this\ndelay, and you are now about to hear it. Sit down there, before me,\nd'Artagnan; you are gentleman enough not to listen standing.\" And the\ncardinal pointed with his finger to a chair for the young man, who was\nso astonished at what was passing that he awaited a second sign from his\ninterlocutor before he obeyed.\n\n\"You are brave, Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" continued his Eminence; \"you are\nprudent, which is still better. I like men of head and heart. Don't be\nafraid,\" said he, smiling. \"By men of heart I mean men of courage.\nBut young as you are, and scarcely entering into the world, you have\npowerful enemies; if you do not take great heed, they will destroy you.\"\n\n\"Alas, monseigneur!\" replied the young man, \"very easily, no doubt, for\nthey are strong and well supported, while I am alone.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's true; but alone as you are, you have done much already, and\nwill do still more, I don't doubt. Yet you have need, I believe, to be\nguided in the adventurous career you have undertaken; for, if I mistake\nnot, you came to Paris with the ambitious idea of making your fortune.\"\n\n\"I am at the age of extravagant hopes, monseigneur,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"There are no extravagant hopes but for fools, monsieur, and you are a\nman of understanding. Now, what would you say to an ensign's commission\nin my Guards, and a company after the campaign?\"\n\n\"Ah, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"You accept it, do you not?\"\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" replied d'Artagnan, with an embarrassed air.\n\n\"How? You refuse?\" cried the cardinal, with astonishment.\n\n\"I am in his Majesty's Guards, monseigneur, and I have no reason to be\ndissatisfied.\"\n\n\"But it appears to me that my Guards--mine--are also his Majesty's\nGuards; and whoever serves in a French corps serves the king.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur, your Eminence has ill understood my words.\"\n\n\"You want a pretext, do you not? I comprehend. Well, you have this\nexcuse: advancement, the opening campaign, the opportunity which I offer\nyou--so much for the world. As regards yourself, the need of protection;\nfor it is fit you should know, Monsieur d'Artagnan, that I have received\nheavy and serious complaints against you. You do not consecrate your\ndays and nights wholly to the king's service.\"\n\nD'Artagnan colored.\n\n\"In fact,\" said the cardinal, placing his hand upon a bundle of papers,\n\"I have here a whole pile which concerns you. I know you to be a man of\nresolution; and your services, well directed, instead of leading you to\nill, might be very advantageous to you. Come; reflect, and decide.\"\n\n\"Your goodness confounds me, monseigneur,\" replied d'Artagnan, \"and I am\nconscious of a greatness of soul in your Eminence that makes me mean as\nan earthworm; but since Monseigneur permits me to speak freely--\"\n\nD'Artagnan paused.\n\n\"Yes; speak.\"\n\n\"Then, I will presume to say that all my friends are in the king's\nMusketeers and Guards, and that by an inconceivable fatality my enemies\nare in the service of your Eminence; I should, therefore, be ill\nreceived here and ill regarded there if I accepted what Monseigneur\noffers me.\"\n\n\"Do you happen to entertain the haughty idea that I have not yet made\nyou an offer equal to your value?\" asked the cardinal, with a smile of\ndisdain.\n\n\"Monseigneur, your Eminence is a hundred times too kind to me; and on\nthe contrary, I think I have not proved myself worthy of your goodness.\nThe siege of La Rochelle is about to be resumed, monseigneur. I shall\nserve under the eye of your Eminence, and if I have the good fortune to\nconduct myself at the siege in such a manner as merits your attention,\nthen I shall at least leave behind me some brilliant action to justify\nthe protection with which you honor me. Everything is best in its\ntime, monseigneur. Hereafter, perhaps, I shall have the right of giving\nmyself; at present I shall appear to sell myself.\"\n\n\"That is to say, you refuse to serve me, monsieur,\" said the cardinal,\nwith a tone of vexation, through which, however, might be seen a sort of\nesteem; \"remain free, then, and guard your hatreds and your sympathies.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur--\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said the cardinal, \"I don't wish you any ill; but you must\nbe aware that it is quite trouble enough to defend and recompense our\nfriends. We owe nothing to our enemies; and let me give you a piece of\nadvice; take care of yourself, Monsieur d'Artagnan, for from the moment\nI withdraw my hand from behind you, I would not give an obolus for your\nlife.\"\n\n\"I will try to do so, monseigneur,\" replied the Gascon, with a noble\nconfidence.\n\n\"Remember at a later period and at a certain moment, if any mischance\nshould happen to you,\" said Richelieu, significantly, \"that it was I\nwho came to seek you, and that I did all in my power to prevent this\nmisfortune befalling you.\"\n\n\"I shall entertain, whatever may happen,\" said d'Artagnan, placing\nhis hand upon his breast and bowing, \"an eternal gratitude toward your\nEminence for that which you now do for me.\"\n\n\"Well, let it be, then, as you have said, Monsieur d'Artagnan; we shall\nsee each other again after the campaign. I will have my eye upon you,\nfor I shall be there,\" replied the cardinal, pointing with his finger to\na magnificent suit of armor he was to wear, \"and on our return, well--we\nwill settle our account!\"\n\n\"Young man,\" said Richelieu, \"if I shall be able to say to you at\nanother time what I have said to you today, I promise you to do so.\"\n\nThis last expression of Richelieu's conveyed a terrible doubt; it\nalarmed d'Artagnan more than a menace would have done, for it was a\nwarning. The cardinal, then, was seeking to preserve him from some\nmisfortune which threatened him. He opened his mouth to reply, but with\na haughty gesture the cardinal dismissed him.\n\nD'Artagnan went out, but at the door his heart almost failed him, and he\nfelt inclined to return. Then the noble and severe countenance of Athos\ncrossed his mind; if he made the compact with the cardinal which he\nrequired, Athos would no more give him his hand--Athos would renounce\nhim.\n\nIt was this fear that restrained him, so powerful is the influence of a\ntruly great character on all that surrounds it.\n\nD'Artagnan descended by the staircase at which he had entered, and found\nAthos and the four Musketeers waiting his appearance, and beginning to\ngrow uneasy. With a word, d'Artagnan reassured them; and Planchet ran to\ninform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer, as\nhis master had come out safe from the Palais-Cardinal.\n\nReturned home with Athos, Aramis and Porthos inquired eagerly the cause\nof the strange interview; but d'Artagnan confined himself to telling\nthem that M. de Richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter\ninto his guards with the rank of ensign, and that he had refused.\n\n\"And you were right,\" cried Aramis and Porthos, with one voice.\n\nAthos fell into a profound reverie and answered nothing. But when they\nwere alone he said, \"You have done that which you ought to have done,\nd'Artagnan; but perhaps you have been wrong.\"\n\nD'Artagnan sighed deeply, for this voice responded to a secret voice of\nhis soul, which told him that great misfortunes awaited him.\n\nThe whole of the next day was spent in preparations for departure.\nD'Artagnan went to take leave of M. de Treville. At that time it was\nbelieved that the separation of the Musketeers and the Guards would\nbe but momentary, the king holding his Parliament that very day and\nproposing to set out the day after. M. de Treville contented himself\nwith asking d'Artagnan if he could do anything for him, but d'Artagnan\nanswered that he was supplied with all he wanted.\n\nThat night brought together all those comrades of the Guards of M.\nDessessart and the company of Musketeers of M. de Treville who had been\naccustomed to associate together. They were parting to meet again when\nit pleased God, and if it pleased God. That night, then, was somewhat\nriotous, as may be imagined. In such cases extreme preoccupation is only\nto be combated by extreme carelessness.\n\nAt the first sound of the morning trumpet the friends separated; the\nMusketeers hastening to the hotel of M. de Treville, the Guards to\nthat of M. Dessessart. Each of the captains then led his company to the\nLouvre, where the king held his review.\n\nThe king was dull and appeared ill, which detracted a little from his\nusual lofty bearing. In fact, the evening before, a fever had seized him\nin the midst of the Parliament, while he was holding his Bed of Justice.\nHe had, not the less, decided upon setting out that same evening; and in\nspite of the remonstrances that had been offered to him, he persisted\nin having the review, hoping by setting it at defiance to conquer the\ndisease which began to lay hold upon him.\n\nThe review over, the Guards set forward alone on their march, the\nMusketeers waiting for the king, which allowed Porthos time to go and\ntake a turn in his superb equipment in the Rue aux Ours.\n\nThe procurator's wife saw him pass in his new uniform and on his fine\nhorse. She loved Porthos too dearly to allow him to part thus; she made\nhim a sign to dismount and come to her. Porthos was magnificent; his\nspurs jingled, his cuirass glittered, his sword knocked proudly against\nhis ample limbs. This time the clerks evinced no inclination to laugh,\nsuch a real ear clipper did Porthos appear.\n\nThe Musketeer was introduced to M. Coquenard, whose little gray eyes\nsparkled with anger at seeing his cousin all blazing new. Nevertheless,\none thing afforded him inward consolation; it was expected by everybody\nthat the campaign would be a severe one. He whispered a hope to himself\nthat this beloved relative might be killed in the field.\n\nPorthos paid his compliments to M. Coquenard and bade him farewell. M.\nCoquenard wished him all sorts of prosperities. As to Mme. Coquenard,\nshe could not restrain her tears; but no evil impressions were taken\nfrom her grief as she was known to be very much attached to her\nrelatives, about whom she was constantly having serious disputes with\nher husband.\n\nBut the real adieux were made in Mme. Coquenard's chamber; they were\nheartrending.\n\nAs long as the procurator's wife could follow him with her eyes, she\nwaved her handkerchief to him, leaning so far out of the window as\nto lead people to believe she wished to precipitate herself.\nPorthos received all these attentions like a man accustomed to such\ndemonstrations, only on turning the corner of the street he lifted his\nhat gracefully, and waved it to her as a sign of adieu.\n\nOn his part Aramis wrote a long letter. To whom? Nobody knew. Kitty, who\nwas to set out that evening for Tours, was waiting in the next chamber.\n\nAthos sipped the last bottle of his Spanish wine.\n\nIn the meantime d'Artagnan was defiling with his company. Arriving at\nthe Faubourg St. Antoine, he turned round to look gaily at the Bastille;\nbut as it was the Bastille alone he looked at, he did not observe\nMilady, who, mounted upon a light chestnut horse, designated him with\nher finger to two ill-looking men who came close up to the ranks to\ntake notice of him. To a look of interrogation which they made, Milady\nreplied by a sign that it was he. Then, certain that there could be\nno mistake in the execution of her orders, she started her horse and\ndisappeared.\n\nThe two men followed the company, and on leaving the Faubourg St.\nAntoine, mounted two horses properly equipped, which a servant without\nlivery had waiting for them.\n\n\n\n\n41 THE SEIGE OF LA ROCHELLE\n\nThe Siege of La Rochelle was one of the great political events of the\nreign of Louis XIII, and one of the great military enterprises of the\ncardinal. It is, then, interesting and even necessary that we should\nsay a few words about it, particularly as many details of this siege are\nconnected in too important a manner with the story we have undertaken to\nrelate to allow us to pass it over in silence.\n\nThe political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were\nextensive. Let us unfold them first, and then pass on to the private\nplans which perhaps had not less influence upon his Eminence than the\nothers.\n\nOf the important cities given up by Henry IV to the Huguenots as\nplaces of safety, there only remained La Rochelle. It became necessary,\ntherefore, to destroy this last bulwark of Calvinism--a dangerous leaven\nwith which the ferments of civil revolt and foreign war were constantly\nmingling.\n\nSpaniards, Englishmen, and Italian malcontents, adventurers of all\nnations, and soldiers of fortune of every sect, flocked at the first\nsummons under the standard of the Protestants, and organized themselves\nlike a vast association, whose branches diverged freely over all parts\nof Europe.\n\nLa Rochelle, which had derived a new importance from the ruin of\nthe other Calvinist cities, was, then, the focus of dissensions and\nambition. Moreover, its port was the last in the kingdom of France open\nto the English, and by closing it against England, our eternal enemy,\nthe cardinal completed the work of Joan of Arc and the Duc de Guise.\n\nThus Bassompierre, who was at once Protestant and Catholic--Protestant\nby conviction and Catholic as commander of the order of the Holy Ghost;\nBassompierre, who was a German by birth and a Frenchman at heart--in\nshort, Bassompierre, who had a distinguished command at the siege of\nLa Rochelle, said, in charging at the head of several other Protestant\nnobles like himself, \"You will see, gentlemen, that we shall be fools\nenough to take La Rochelle.\"\n\nAnd Bassompierre was right. The cannonade of the Isle of Re presaged to\nhim the dragonnades of the Cevennes; the taking of La Rochelle was the\npreface to the revocation of the Edict of Nantes.\n\nWe have hinted that by the side of these views of the leveling and\nsimplifying minister, which belong to history, the chronicler is forced\nto recognize the lesser motives of the amorous man and jealous rival.\n\nRichelieu, as everyone knows, had loved the queen. Was this love a\nsimple political affair, or was it naturally one of those profound\npassions which Anne of Austria inspired in those who approached her?\nThat we are not able to say; but at all events, we have seen, by the\nanterior developments of this story, that Buckingham had the advantage\nover him, and in two or three circumstances, particularly that of the\ndiamond studs, had, thanks to the devotedness of the three Musketeers\nand the courage and conduct of d'Artagnan, cruelly mystified him.\n\nIt was, then, Richelieu's object, not only to get rid of an enemy of\nFrance, but to avenge himself on a rival; but this vengeance must be\ngrand and striking and worthy in every way of a man who held in his\nhand, as his weapon for combat, the forces of a kingdom.\n\nRichelieu knew that in combating England he combated Buckingham; that in\ntriumphing over England he triumphed over Buckingham--in short, that in\nhumiliating England in the eyes of Europe he humiliated Buckingham in\nthe eyes of the queen.\n\nOn his side Buckingham, in pretending to maintain the honor of England,\nwas moved by interests exactly like those of the cardinal. Buckingham\nalso was pursuing a private vengeance. Buckingham could not under any\npretense be admitted into France as an ambassador; he wished to enter it\nas a conqueror.\n\nIt resulted from this that the real stake in this game, which two most\npowerful kingdoms played for the good pleasure of two amorous men, was\nsimply a kind look from Anne of Austria.\n\nThe first advantage had been gained by Buckingham. Arriving unexpectedly\nin sight of the Isle of Re with ninety vessels and nearly twenty\nthousand men, he had surprised the Comte de Toiras, who commanded for\nthe king in the Isle, and he had, after a bloody conflict, effected his\nlanding.\n\nAllow us to observe in passing that in this fight perished the Baron de\nChantal; that the Baron de Chantal left a little orphan girl eighteen\nmonths old, and that this little girl was afterward Mme. de Sevigne.\n\nThe Comte de Toiras retired into the citadel St. Martin with his\ngarrison, and threw a hundred men into a little fort called the fort of\nLa Pree.\n\nThis event had hastened the resolutions of the cardinal; and till the\nking and he could take the command of the siege of La Rochelle, which\nwas determined, he had sent Monsieur to direct the first operations,\nand had ordered all the troops he could dispose of to march toward the\ntheater of war. It was of this detachment, sent as a vanguard, that our\nfriend d'Artagnan formed a part.\n\nThe king, as we have said, was to follow as soon as his Bed of\nJustice had been held; but on rising from his Bed of Justice on the\ntwenty-eighth of June, he felt himself attacked by fever. He was,\nnotwithstanding, anxious to set out; but his illness becoming more\nserious, he was forced to stop at Villeroy.\n\nNow, whenever the king halted, the Musketeers halted. It followed\nthat d'Artagnan, who was as yet purely and simply in the Guards, found\nhimself, for the time at least, separated from his good friends--Athos,\nPorthos, and Aramis. This separation, which was no more than an\nunpleasant circumstance, would have certainly become a cause of serious\nuneasiness if he had been able to guess by what unknown dangers he was\nsurrounded.\n\nHe, however, arrived without accident in the camp established before La\nRochelle, of the tenth of the month of September of the year 1627.\n\nEverything was in the same state. The Duke of Buckingham and his\nEnglish, masters of the Isle of Re, continued to besiege, but without\nsuccess, the citadel St. Martin and the fort of La Pree; and hostilities\nwith La Rochelle had commenced, two or three days before, about a fort\nwhich the Duc d'Angouleme had caused to be constructed near the city.\n\nThe Guards, under the command of M. Dessessart, took up their quarters\nat the Minimes; but, as we know, d'Artagnan, possessed with ambition to\nenter the Musketeers, had formed but few friendships among his comrades,\nand he felt himself isolated and given up to his own reflections.\n\nHis reflections were not very cheerful. From the time of his arrival\nin Paris, he had been mixed up with public affairs; but his own private\naffairs had made no great progress, either in love or fortune. As to\nlove, the only woman he could have loved was Mme. Bonacieux; and Mme.\nBonacieux had disappeared, without his being able to discover what had\nbecome of her. As to fortune, he had made--he, humble as he was--an\nenemy of the cardinal; that is to say, of a man before whom trembled the\ngreatest men of the kingdom, beginning with the king.\n\nThat man had the power to crush him, and yet he had not done so. For a\nmind so perspicuous as that of d'Artagnan, this indulgence was a light\nby which he caught a glimpse of a better future.\n\nThen he had made himself another enemy, less to be feared, he thought;\nbut nevertheless, he instinctively felt, not to be despised. This enemy\nwas Milady.\n\nIn exchange for all this, he had acquired the protection and good will\nof the queen; but the favor of the queen was at the present time an\nadditional cause of persecution, and her protection, as it was known,\nprotected badly--as witness Chalais and Mme. Bonacieux.\n\nWhat he had clearly gained in all this was the diamond, worth five\nor six thousand livres, which he wore on his finger; and even this\ndiamond--supposing that d'Artagnan, in his projects of ambition,\nwished to keep it, to make it someday a pledge for the gratitude of the\nqueen--had not in the meanwhile, since he could not part with it, more\nvalue than the gravel he trod under his feet.\n\nWe say the gravel he trod under his feet, for d'Artagnan made these\nreflections while walking solitarily along a pretty little road which\nled from the camp to the village of Angoutin. Now, these reflections had\nled him further than he intended, and the day was beginning to decline\nwhen, by the last ray of the setting sun, he thought he saw the barrel\nof a musket glitter from behind a hedge.\n\nD'Artagnan had a quick eye and a prompt understanding. He comprehended\nthat the musket had not come there of itself, and that he who bore it\nhad not concealed himself behind a hedge with any friendly intentions.\nHe determined, therefore, to direct his course as clear from it as he\ncould when, on the opposite side of the road, from behind a rock, he\nperceived the extremity of another musket.\n\nThis was evidently an ambuscade.\n\nThe young man cast a glance at the first musket and saw, with a certain\ndegree of inquietude, that it was leveled in his direction; but as soon\nas he perceived that the orifice of the barrel was motionless, he threw\nhimself upon the ground. At the same instant the gun was fired, and he\nheard the whistling of a ball pass over his head.\n\nNo time was to be lost. D'Artagnan sprang up with a bound, and at the\nsame instant the ball from the other musket tore up the gravel on the\nvery spot on the road where he had thrown himself with his face to the\nground.\n\nD'Artagnan was not one of those foolhardy men who seek a ridiculous\ndeath in order that it may be said of them that they did not retreat a\nsingle step. Besides, courage was out of the question here; d'Artagnan\nhad fallen into an ambush.\n\n\"If there is a third shot,\" said he to himself, \"I am a lost man.\"\n\nHe immediately, therefore, took to his heels and ran toward the camp,\nwith the swiftness of the young men of his country, so renowned for\ntheir agility; but whatever might be his speed, the first who fired,\nhaving had time to reload, fired a second shot, and this time so well\naimed that it struck his hat, and carried it ten paces from him.\n\nAs he, however, had no other hat, he picked up this as he ran, and\narrived at his quarters very pale and quite out of breath. He sat down\nwithout saying a word to anybody, and began to reflect.\n\nThis event might have three causes:\n\nThe first and the most natural was that it might be an ambuscade of the\nRochellais, who might not be sorry to kill one of his Majesty's Guards,\nbecause it would be an enemy the less, and this enemy might have a\nwell-furnished purse in his pocket.\n\nD'Artagnan took his hat, examined the hole made by the ball, and shook\nhis head. The ball was not a musket ball--it was an arquebus ball. The\naccuracy of the aim had first given him the idea that a special weapon\nhad been employed. This could not, then, be a military ambuscade, as the\nball was not of the regular caliber.\n\nThis might be a kind remembrance of Monsieur the Cardinal. It may be\nobserved that at the very moment when, thanks to the ray of the sun,\nhe perceived the gun barrel, he was thinking with astonishment on the\nforbearance of his Eminence with respect to him.\n\nBut d'Artagnan again shook his head. For people toward whom he had but\nto put forth his hand, his Eminence had rarely recourse to such means.\n\nIt might be a vengeance of Milady; that was most probable.\n\nHe tried in vain to remember the faces or dress of the assassins; he had\nescaped so rapidly that he had not had leisure to notice anything.\n\n\"Ah, my poor friends!\" murmured d'Artagnan; \"where are you? And that you\nshould fail me!\"\n\nD'Artagnan passed a very bad night. Three or four times he started up,\nimagining that a man was approaching his bed for the purpose of stabbing\nhim. Nevertheless, day dawned without darkness having brought any\naccident.\n\nBut d'Artagnan well suspected that that which was deferred was not\nrelinquished.\n\nD'Artagnan remained all day in his quarters, assigning as a reason to\nhimself that the weather was bad.\n\nAt nine o'clock the next morning, the drums beat to arms. The Duc\nd'Orleans visited the posts. The guards were under arms, and d'Artagnan\ntook his place in the midst of his comrades.\n\nMonsieur passed along the front of the line; then all the superior\nofficers approached him to pay their compliments, M. Dessessart, captain\nof the Guards, as well as the others.\n\nAt the expiration of a minute or two, it appeared to d'Artagnan that M.\nDessessart made him a sign to approach. He waited for a fresh gesture\non the part of his superior, for fear he might be mistaken; but this\ngesture being repeated, he left the ranks, and advanced to receive\norders.\n\n\"Monsieur is about to ask for some men of good will for a dangerous\nmission, but one which will do honor to those who shall accomplish\nit; and I made you a sign in order that you might hold yourself in\nreadiness.\"\n\n\"Thanks, my captain!\" replied d'Artagnan, who wished for nothing\nbetter than an opportunity to distinguish himself under the eye of the\nlieutenant general.\n\nIn fact the Rochellais had made a sortie during the night, and had\nretaken a bastion of which the royal army had gained possession two days\nbefore. The matter was to ascertain, by reconnoitering, how the enemy\nguarded this bastion.\n\nAt the end of a few minutes Monsieur raised his voice, and said, \"I\nwant for this mission three or four volunteers, led by a man who can be\ndepended upon.\"\n\n\"As to the man to be depended upon, I have him under my hand, monsieur,\"\nsaid M. Dessessart, pointing to d'Artagnan; \"and as to the four or five\nvolunteers, Monsieur has but to make his intentions known, and the men\nwill not be wanting.\"\n\n\"Four men of good will who will risk being killed with me!\" said\nd'Artagnan, raising his sword.\n\nTwo of his comrades of the Guards immediately sprang forward, and two\nother soldiers having joined them, the number was deemed sufficient.\nD'Artagnan declined all others, being unwilling to take the first chance\nfrom those who had the priority.\n\nIt was not known whether, after the taking of the bastion, the\nRochellais had evacuated it or left a garrison in it; the object then\nwas to examine the place near enough to verify the reports.\n\nD'Artagnan set out with his four companions, and followed the trench;\nthe two Guards marched abreast with him, and the two soldiers followed\nbehind.\n\nThey arrived thus, screened by the lining of the trench, till they\ncame within a hundred paces of the bastion. There, on turning round,\nd'Artagnan perceived that the two soldiers had disappeared.\n\nHe thought that, beginning to be afraid, they had stayed behind, and he\ncontinued to advance.\n\nAt the turning of the counterscarp they found themselves within about\nsixty paces of the bastion. They saw no one, and the bastion seemed\nabandoned.\n\nThe three composing our forlorn hope were deliberating whether they\nshould proceed any further, when all at once a circle of smoke enveloped\nthe giant of stone, and a dozen balls came whistling around d'Artagnan\nand his companions.\n\nThey knew all they wished to know; the bastion was guarded. A longer\nstay in this dangerous spot would have been useless imprudence.\nD'Artagnan and his two companions turned their backs, and commenced a\nretreat which resembled a flight.\n\nOn arriving at the angle of the trench which was to serve them as\na rampart, one of the Guardsmen fell. A ball had passed through his\nbreast. The other, who was safe and sound, continued his way toward the\ncamp.\n\nD'Artagnan was not willing to abandon his companion thus, and stooped to\nraise him and assist him in regaining the lines; but at this moment two\nshots were fired. One ball struck the head of the already-wounded guard,\nand the other flattened itself against a rock, after having passed\nwithin two inches of d'Artagnan.\n\nThe young man turned quickly round, for this attack could not have come\nfrom the bastion, which was hidden by the angle of the trench. The idea\nof the two soldiers who had abandoned him occurred to his mind, and with\nthem he remembered the assassins of two evenings before. He resolved\nthis time to know with whom he had to deal, and fell upon the body of\nhis comrade as if he were dead.\n\nHe quickly saw two heads appear above an abandoned work within thirty\npaces of him; they were the heads of the two soldiers. D'Artagnan had\nnot been deceived; these two men had only followed for the purpose of\nassassinating him, hoping that the young man's death would be placed to\nthe account of the enemy.\n\nAs he might be only wounded and might denounce their crime, they came\nup to him with the purpose of making sure. Fortunately, deceived by\nd'Artagnan's trick, they neglected to reload their guns.\n\nWhen they were within ten paces of him, d'Artagnan, who in falling had\ntaken care not to let go his sword, sprang up close to them.\n\nThe assassins comprehended that if they fled toward the camp without\nhaving killed their man, they should be accused by him; therefore\ntheir first idea was to join the enemy. One of them took his gun by\nthe barrel, and used it as he would a club. He aimed a terrible blow\nat d'Artagnan, who avoided it by springing to one side; but by this\nmovement he left a passage free to the bandit, who darted off toward the\nbastion. As the Rochellais who guarded the bastion were ignorant of the\nintentions of the man they saw coming toward them, they fired upon him,\nand he fell, struck by a ball which broke his shoulder.\n\nMeantime d'Artagnan had thrown himself upon the other soldier, attacking\nhim with his sword. The conflict was not long; the wretch had nothing\nto defend himself with but his discharged arquebus. The sword of the\nGuardsman slipped along the barrel of the now-useless weapon, and passed\nthrough the thigh of the assassin, who fell.\n\nD'Artagnan immediately placed the point of his sword at his throat.\n\n\"Oh, do not kill me!\" cried the bandit. \"Pardon, pardon, my officer, and\nI will tell you all.\"\n\n\"Is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it?\"\nasked the young man, withholding his arm.\n\n\"Yes; if you think existence worth anything to a man of twenty, as you\nare, and who may hope for everything, being handsome and brave, as you\nare.\"\n\n\"Wretch,\" cried d'Artagnan, \"speak quickly! Who employed you to\nassassinate me?\"\n\n\"A woman whom I don't know, but who is called Milady.\"\n\n\"But if you don't know this woman, how do you know her name?\"\n\n\"My comrade knows her, and called her so. It was with him she agreed,\nand not with me; he even has in his pocket a letter from that person,\nwho attaches great importance to you, as I have heard him say.\"\n\n\"But how did you become concerned in this villainous affair?\"\n\n\"He proposed to me to undertake it with him, and I agreed.\"\n\n\"And how much did she give you for this fine enterprise?\"\n\n\"A hundred louis.\"\n\n\"Well, come!\" said the young man, laughing, \"she thinks I am worth\nsomething. A hundred louis? Well, that was a temptation for two wretches\nlike you. I understand why you accepted it, and I grant you my pardon;\nbut upon one condition.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" said the soldier, uneasy at perceiving that all was not\nover.\n\n\"That you will go and fetch me the letter your comrade has in his\npocket.\"\n\n\"But,\" cried the bandit, \"that is only another way of killing me. How\ncan I go and fetch that letter under the fire of the bastion?\"\n\n\"You must nevertheless make up your mind to go and get it, or I swear\nyou shall die by my hand.\"\n\n\"Pardon, monsieur; pity! In the name of that young lady you love,\nand whom you perhaps believe dead but who is not!\" cried the bandit,\nthrowing himself upon his knees and leaning upon his hand--for he began\nto lose his strength with his blood.\n\n\"And how do you know there is a young woman whom I love, and that I\nbelieved that woman dead?\" asked d'Artagnan.\n\n\"By that letter which my comrade has in his pocket.\"\n\n\"You see, then,\" said d'Artagnan, \"that I must have that letter. So no\nmore delay, no more hesitation; or else whatever may be my repugnance\nto soiling my sword a second time with the blood of a wretch like you, I\nswear by my faith as an honest man--\" and at these words d'Artagnan made\nso fierce a gesture that the wounded man sprang up.\n\n\"Stop, stop!\" cried he, regaining strength by force of terror. \"I will\ngo--I will go!\"\n\nD'Artagnan took the soldier's arquebus, made him go on before him, and\nurged him toward his companion by pricking him behind with his sword.\n\nIt was a frightful thing to see this wretch, leaving a long track of\nblood on the ground he passed over, pale with approaching death, trying\nto drag himself along without being seen to the body of his accomplice,\nwhich lay twenty paces from him.\n\nTerror was so strongly painted on his face, covered with a cold sweat,\nthat d'Artagnan took pity on him, and casting upon him a look of\ncontempt, \"Stop,\" said he, \"I will show you the difference between a\nman of courage and such a coward as you. Stay where you are; I will go\nmyself.\"\n\nAnd with a light step, an eye on the watch, observing the movements\nof the enemy and taking advantage of the accidents of the ground,\nd'Artagnan succeeded in reaching the second soldier.\n\nThere were two means of gaining his object--to search him on the spot,\nor to carry him away, making a buckler of his body, and search him in\nthe trench.\n\nD'Artagnan preferred the second means, and lifted the assassin onto his\nshoulders at the moment the enemy fired.\n\nA slight shock, the dull noise of three balls which penetrated the\nflesh, a last cry, a convulsion of agony, proved to d'Artagnan that the\nwould-be assassin had saved his life.\n\nD'Artagnan regained the trench, and threw the corpse beside the wounded\nman, who was as pale as death.\n\nThen he began to search. A leather pocketbook, a purse, in which was\nevidently a part of the sum which the bandit had received, with a dice\nbox and dice, completed the possessions of the dead man.\n\nHe left the box and dice where they fell, threw the purse to the wounded\nman, and eagerly opened the pocketbook.\n\nAmong some unimportant papers he found the following letter, that which\nhe had sought at the risk of his life:\n\n\n\"Since you have lost sight of that woman and she is now in safety in\nthe convent, which you should never have allowed her to reach, try, at\nleast, not to miss the man. If you do, you know that my hand stretches\nfar, and that you shall pay very dearly for the hundred louis you have\nfrom me.\"\n\n\nNo signature. Nevertheless it was plain the letter came from Milady. He\nconsequently kept it as a piece of evidence, and being in safety behind\nthe angle of the trench, he began to interrogate the wounded man. He\nconfessed that he had undertaken with his comrade--the same who was\nkilled--to carry off a young woman who was to leave Paris by the\nBarriere de La Villette; but having stopped to drink at a cabaret, they\nhad missed the carriage by ten minutes.\n\n\"But what were you to do with that woman?\" asked d'Artagnan, with\nanguish.\n\n\"We were to have conveyed her to a hotel in the Place Royale,\" said the\nwounded man.\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" murmured d'Artagnan; \"that's the place--Milady's own\nresidence!\"\n\nThen the young man tremblingly comprehended what a terrible thirst for\nvengeance urged this woman on to destroy him, as well as all who loved\nhim, and how well she must be acquainted with the affairs of the court,\nsince she had discovered all. There could be no doubt she owed this\ninformation to the cardinal.\n\nBut amid all this he perceived, with a feeling of real joy, that the\nqueen must have discovered the prison in which poor Mme. Bonacieux was\nexplaining her devotion, and that she had freed her from that prison;\nand the letter he had received from the young woman, and her passage\nalong the road of Chaillot like an apparition, were now explained.\n\nThen also, as Athos had predicted, it became possible to find Mme.\nBonacieux, and a convent was not impregnable.\n\nThis idea completely restored clemency to his heart. He turned toward\nthe wounded man, who had watched with intense anxiety all the various\nexpressions of his countenance, and holding out his arm to him, said,\n\"Come, I will not abandon you thus. Lean upon me, and let us return to\nthe camp.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the man, who could scarcely believe in such magnanimity,\n\"but is it not to have me hanged?\"\n\n\"You have my word,\" said he; \"for the second time I give you your life.\"\n\nThe wounded man sank upon his knees, to again kiss the feet of his\npreserver; but d'Artagnan, who had no longer a motive for staying so\nnear the enemy, abridged the testimonials of his gratitude.\n\nThe Guardsman who had returned at the first discharge announced the\ndeath of his four companions. They were therefore much astonished and\ndelighted in the regiment when they saw the young man come back safe and\nsound.\n\nD'Artagnan explained the sword wound of his companion by a sortie which\nhe improvised. He described the death of the other soldier, and the\nperils they had encountered. This recital was for him the occasion of\nveritable triumph. The whole army talked of this expedition for a day,\nand Monsieur paid him his compliments upon it. Besides this, as\nevery great action bears its recompense with it, the brave exploit of\nd'Artagnan resulted in the restoration of the tranquility he had lost.\nIn fact, d'Artagnan believed that he might be tranquil, as one of his\ntwo enemies was killed and the other devoted to his interests.\n\nThis tranquillity proved one thing--that d'Artagnan did not yet know\nMilady.\n\n\n\n\n42 THE ANJOU WINE\n\nAfter the most disheartening news of the king's health, a report of his\nconvalescence began to prevail in the camp; and as he was very anxious\nto be in person at the siege, it was said that as soon as he could mount\na horse he would set forward.\n\nMeantime, Monsieur, who knew that from one day to the other he might\nexpect to be removed from his command by the Duc d'Angouleme, by\nBassompierre, or by Schomberg, who were all eager for his post, did but\nlittle, lost his days in wavering, and did not dare to attempt any great\nenterprise to drive the English from the Isle of Re, where they still\nbesieged the citadel St. Martin and the fort of La Pree, as on their\nside the French were besieging La Rochelle.\n\nD'Artagnan, as we have said, had become more tranquil, as always\nhappens after a past danger, particularly when the danger seems to have\nvanished. He only felt one uneasiness, and that was at not hearing any\ntidings from his friends.\n\nBut one morning at the commencement of the month of November everything\nwas explained to him by this letter, dated from Villeroy:\n\n\nM. d'Artagnan,\n\nMM. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, after having had an entertainment at my\nhouse and enjoying themselves very much, created such a disturbance that\nthe provost of the castle, a rigid man, has ordered them to be confined\nfor some days; but I accomplish the order they have given me by\nforwarding to you a dozen bottles of my Anjou wine, with which they are\nmuch pleased. They are desirous that you should drink to their health\nin their favorite wine. I have done this, and am, monsieur, with great\nrespect,\n\nYour very humble and obedient servant,\n\nGodeau, Purveyor of the Musketeers\n\n\n\"That's all well!\" cried d'Artagnan. \"They think of me in their\npleasures, as I thought of them in my troubles. Well, I will certainly\ndrink to their health with all my heart, but I will not drink alone.\"\n\nAnd d'Artagnan went among those Guardsmen with whom he had formed\ngreater intimacy than with the others, to invite them to enjoy with\nhim this present of delicious Anjou wine which had been sent him from\nVilleroy.\n\nOne of the two Guardsmen was engaged that evening, and another the next,\nso the meeting was fixed for the day after that.\n\nD'Artagnan, on his return, sent the twelve bottles of wine to the\nrefreshment room of the Guards, with strict orders that great care\nshould be taken of it; and then, on the day appointed, as the dinner\nwas fixed for midday d'Artagnan sent Planchet at nine in the morning to\nassist in preparing everything for the entertainment.\n\nPlanchet, very proud of being raised to the dignity of landlord, thought\nhe would make all ready, like an intelligent man; and with this view\ncalled in the assistance of the lackey of one of his master's guests,\nnamed Fourreau, and the false soldier who had tried to kill d'Artagnan\nand who, belonging to no corps, had entered into the service of\nd'Artagnan, or rather of Planchet, after d'Artagnan had saved his life.\n\nThe hour of the banquet being come, the two guards arrived, took their\nplaces, and the dishes were arranged on the table. Planchet waited,\ntowel on arm; Fourreau uncorked the bottles; and Brisemont, which was\nthe name of the convalescent, poured the wine, which was a little shaken\nby its journey, carefully into decanters. Of this wine, the first bottle\nbeing a little thick at the bottom, Brisemont poured the lees into a\nglass, and d'Artagnan desired him to drink it, for the poor devil had\nnot yet recovered his strength.\n\nThe guests having eaten the soup, were about to lift the first glass of\nwine to their lips, when all at once the cannon sounded from Fort\nLouis and Fort Neuf. The Guardsmen, imagining this to be caused by some\nunexpected attack, either of the besieged or the English, sprang to\ntheir swords. D'Artagnan, not less forward than they, did likewise, and\nall ran out, in order to repair to their posts.\n\nBut scarcely were they out of the room before they were made aware of\nthe cause of this noise. Cries of \"Live the king! Live the cardinal!\"\nresounded on every side, and the drums were beaten in all directions.\n\nIn short, the king, impatient, as has been said, had come by forced\nmarches, and had that moment arrived with all his household and a\nreinforcement of ten thousand troops. His Musketeers proceeded and\nfollowed him. D'Artagnan, placed in line with his company, saluted with\nan expressive gesture his three friends, whose eyes soon discovered him,\nand M. de Treville, who detected him at once.\n\nThe ceremony of reception over, the four friends were soon in one\nanother's arms.\n\n\"Pardieu!\" cried d'Artagnan, \"you could not have arrived in better time;\nthe dinner cannot have had time to get cold! Can it, gentlemen?\" added\nthe young man, turning to the two Guards, whom he introduced to his\nfriends.\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" said Porthos, \"it appears we are feasting!\"\n\n\"I hope,\" said Aramis, \"there are no women at your dinner.\"\n\n\"Is there any drinkable wine in your tavern?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"Well, pardieu! there is yours, my dear friend,\" replied d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Our wine!\" said Athos, astonished.\n\n\"Yes, that you sent me.\"\n\n\"We sent you wine?\"\n\n\"You know very well--the wine from the hills of Anjou.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know what brand you are talking about.\"\n\n\"The wine you prefer.\"\n\n\"Well, in the absence of champagne and chambertin, you must content\nyourselves with that.\"\n\n\"And so, connoisseurs in wine as we are, we have sent you some Anjou\nwine?\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Not exactly, it is the wine that was sent by your order.\"\n\n\"On our account?\" said the three Musketeers.\n\n\"Did you send this wine, Aramis?\" said Athos.\n\n\"No; and you, Porthos?\"\n\n\"No; and you, Athos?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"If it was not you, it was your purveyor,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Our purveyor!\"\n\n\"Yes, your purveyor, Godeau--the purveyor of the Musketeers.\"\n\n\"My faith! never mind where it comes from,\" said Porthos, \"let us taste\nit, and if it is good, let us drink it.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Athos; \"don't let us drink wine which comes from an unknown\nsource.\"\n\n\"You are right, Athos,\" said d'Artagnan. \"Did none of you charge your\npurveyor, Godeau, to send me some wine?\"\n\n\"No! And yet you say he has sent you some as from us?\"\n\n\"Here is his letter,\" said d'Artagnan, and he presented the note to his\ncomrades.\n\n\"This is not his writing!\" said Athos. \"I am acquainted with it; before\nwe left Villeroy I settled the accounts of the regiment.\"\n\n\"A false letter altogether,\" said Porthos, \"we have not been\ndisciplined.\"\n\n\"d'Artagnan,\" said Aramis, in a reproachful tone, \"how could you believe\nthat we had made a disturbance?\"\n\nD'Artagnan grew pale, and a convulsive trembling shook all his limbs.\n\n\"Thou alarmest me!\" said Athos, who never used thee and thou but upon\nvery particular occasions, \"what has happened?\"\n\n\"Look you, my friends!\" cried d'Artagnan, \"a horrible suspicion crosses\nmy mind! Can this be another vengeance of that woman?\"\n\nIt was now Athos who turned pale.\n\nD'Artagnan rushed toward the refreshment room, the three Musketeers and\nthe two Guards following him.\n\nThe first object that met the eyes of d'Artagnan on entering the\nroom was Brisemont, stretched upon the ground and rolling in horrible\nconvulsions.\n\nPlanchet and Fourreau, as pale as death, were trying to give him succor;\nbut it was plain that all assistance was useless--all the features of\nthe dying man were distorted with agony.\n\n\"Ah!\" cried he, on perceiving d'Artagnan, \"ah! this is frightful! You\npretend to pardon me, and you poison me!\"\n\n\"I!\" cried d'Artagnan. \"I, wretch? What do you say?\"\n\n\"I say that it was you who gave me the wine; I say that it was you who\ndesired me to drink it. I say you wished to avenge yourself on me, and I\nsay that it is horrible!\"\n\n\"Do not think so, Brisemont,\" said d'Artagnan; \"do not think so. I swear\nto you, I protest--\"\n\n\"Oh, but God is above! God will punish you! My God, grant that he may\none day suffer what I suffer!\"\n\n\"Upon the Gospel,\" said d'Artagnan, throwing himself down by the dying\nman, \"I swear to you that the wine was poisoned and that I was going to\ndrink of it as you did.\"\n\n\"I do not believe you,\" cried the soldier, and he expired amid horrible\ntortures.\n\n\"Frightful! frightful!\" murmured Athos, while Porthos broke the bottles\nand Aramis gave orders, a little too late, that a confessor should be\nsent for.\n\n\"Oh, my friends,\" said d'Artagnan, \"you come once more to save my life,\nnot only mine but that of these gentlemen. Gentlemen,\" continued he,\naddressing the Guardsmen, \"I request you will be silent with regard to\nthis adventure. Great personages may have had a hand in what you have\nseen, and if talked about, the evil would only recoil upon us.\"\n\n\"Ah, monsieur!\" stammered Planchet, more dead than alive, \"ah, monsieur,\nwhat an escape I have had!\"\n\n\"How, sirrah! you were going to drink my wine?\"\n\n\"To the health of the king, monsieur; I was going to drink a small glass\nof it if Fourreau had not told me I was called.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" said Fourreau, whose teeth chattered with terror, \"I wanted to\nget him out of the way that I might drink myself.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said d'Artagnan, addressing the Guardsmen, \"you may easily\ncomprehend that such a feast can only be very dull after what has taken\nplace; so accept my excuses, and put off the party till another day, I\nbeg of you.\"\n\nThe two Guardsmen courteously accepted d'Artagnan's excuses, and\nperceiving that the four friends desired to be alone, retired.\n\nWhen the young Guardsman and the three Musketeers were without\nwitnesses, they looked at one another with an air which plainly\nexpressed that each of them perceived the gravity of their situation.\n\n\"In the first place,\" said Athos, \"let us leave this chamber; the dead\nare not agreeable company, particularly when they have died a violent\ndeath.\"\n\n\"Planchet,\" said d'Artagnan, \"I commit the corpse of this poor devil to\nyour care. Let him be interred in holy ground. He committed a crime, it\nis true; but he repented of it.\"\n\nAnd the four friends quit the room, leaving to Planchet and Fourreau the\nduty of paying mortuary honors to Brisemont.\n\nThe host gave them another chamber, and served them with fresh eggs and\nsome water, which Athos went himself to draw at the fountain. In a few\nwords, Porthos and Aramis were posted as to the situation.\n\n\"Well,\" said d'Artagnan to Athos, \"you see, my dear friend, that this is\nwar to the death.\"\n\nAthos shook his head.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" replied he, \"I perceive that plainly; but do you really\nbelieve it is she?\"\n\n\"I am sure of it.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, I confess I still doubt.\"\n\n\"But the fleur-de-lis on her shoulder?\"\n\n\"She is some Englishwoman who has committed a crime in France, and has\nbeen branded in consequence.\"\n\n\"Athos, she is your wife, I tell you,\" repeated d'Artagnan; \"only\nreflect how much the two descriptions resemble each other.\"\n\n\"Yes; but I should think the other must be dead, I hanged her so\neffectually.\"\n\nIt was d'Artagnan who now shook his head in his turn.\n\n\"But in either case, what is to be done?\" said the young man.\n\n\"The fact is, one cannot remain thus, with a sword hanging eternally\nover his head,\" said Athos. \"We must extricate ourselves from this\nposition.\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\n\"Listen! You must try to see her, and have an explanation with her. Say\nto her: 'Peace or war! My word as a gentleman never to say anything of\nyou, never to do anything against you; on your side, a solemn oath\nto remain neutral with respect to me. If not, I will apply to the\nchancellor, I will apply to the king, I will apply to the hangman, I\nwill move the courts against you, I will denounce you as branded, I will\nbring you to trial; and if you are acquitted, well, by the faith of a\ngentleman, I will kill you at the corner of some wall, as I would a mad\ndog.'\"\n\n\"I like the means well enough,\" said d'Artagnan, \"but where and how to\nmeet with her?\"\n\n\"Time, dear friend, time brings round opportunity; opportunity is the\nmartingale of man. The more we have ventured the more we gain, when we\nknow how to wait.\"\n\n\"Yes; but to wait surrounded by assassins and poisoners.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said Athos. \"God has preserved us hitherto, God will preserve us\nstill.\"\n\n\"Yes, we. Besides, we are men; and everything considered, it is our lot\nto risk our lives; but she,\" asked he, in an undertone.\n\n\"What she?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"Constance.\"\n\n\"Madame Bonacieux! Ah, that's true!\" said Athos. \"My poor friend, I had\nforgotten you were in love.\"\n\n\"Well, but,\" said Aramis, \"have you not learned by the letter you\nfound on the wretched corpse that she is in a convent? One may be very\ncomfortable in a convent; and as soon as the siege of La Rochelle is\nterminated, I promise you on my part--\"\n\n\"Good,\" cried Athos, \"good! Yes, my dear Aramis, we all know that your\nviews have a religious tendency.\"\n\n\"I am only temporarily a Musketeer,\" said Aramis, humbly.\n\n\"It is some time since we heard from his mistress,\" said Athos, in a low\nvoice. \"But take no notice; we know all about that.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Porthos, \"it appears to me that the means are very simple.\"\n\n\"What?\" asked d'Artagnan.\n\n\"You say she is in a convent?\" replied Porthos.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Very well. As soon as the siege is over, we'll carry her off from that\nconvent.\"\n\n\"But we must first learn what convent she is in.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"But I think I have it,\" said Athos. \"Don't you say, dear d'Artagnan,\nthat it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her?\"\n\n\"I believe so, at least.\"\n\n\"In that case Porthos will assist us.\"\n\n\"And how so, if you please?\"\n\n\"Why, by your marchioness, your duchess, your princess. She must have a\nlong arm.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Porthos, placing a finger on his lips. \"I believe her to be\na cardinalist; she must know nothing of the matter.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Aramis, \"I take upon myself to obtain intelligence of her.\"\n\n\"You, Aramis?\" cried the three friends. \"You! And how?\"\n\n\"By the queen's almoner, to whom I am very intimately allied,\" said\nAramis, coloring.\n\nAnd on this assurance, the four friends, who had finished their modest\nrepast, separated, with the promise of meeting again that evening.\nD'Artagnan returned to less important affairs, and the three Musketeers\nrepaired to the king's quarters, where they had to prepare their\nlodging.\n\n\n\n\n43 THE SIGN OF THE RED DOVECOT\n\nMeanwhile the king, who, with more reason than the cardinal, showed his\nhatred for Buckingham, although scarcely arrived was in such a haste to\nmeet the enemy that he commanded every disposition to be made to drive\nthe English from the Isle of Re, and afterward to press the siege of La\nRochelle; but notwithstanding his earnest wish, he was delayed by the\ndissensions which broke out between MM. Bassompierre and Schomberg,\nagainst the Duc d'Angouleme.\n\nMM. Bassompierre and Schomberg were marshals of France, and claimed\ntheir right of commanding the army under the orders of the king; but the\ncardinal, who feared that Bassompierre, a Huguenot at heart, might\npress but feebly the English and Rochellais, his brothers in religion,\nsupported the Duc d'Angouleme, whom the king, at his instigation,\nhad named lieutenant general. The result was that to prevent MM.\nBassompierre and Schomberg from deserting the army, a separate command\nhad to be given to each. Bassompierre took up his quarters on the north\nof the city, between Leu and Dompierre; the Duc d'Angouleme on the\neast, from Dompierre to Perigny; and M. de Schomberg on the south, from\nPerigny to Angoutin.\n\nThe quarters of Monsieur were at Dompierre; the quarters of the king\nwere sometimes at Estree, sometimes at Jarrie; the cardinal's quarters\nwere upon the downs, at the bridge of La Pierre, in a simple house\nwithout any entrenchment. So that Monsieur watched Bassompierre; the\nking, the Duc d'Angouleme; and the cardinal, M. de Schomberg.\n\nAs soon as this organization was established, they set about driving the\nEnglish from the Isle.\n\nThe juncture was favorable. The English, who require, above everything,\ngood living in order to be good soldiers, only eating salt meat and bad\nbiscuit, had many invalids in their camp. Still further, the sea, very\nrough at this period of the year all along the sea coast, destroyed\nevery day some little vessel; and the shore, from the point of\nl'Aiguillon to the trenches, was at every tide literally covered with\nthe wrecks of pinnacles, roberges, and feluccas. The result was that\neven if the king's troops remained quietly in their camp, it was evident\nthat some day or other, Buckingham, who only continued in the Isle from\nobstinacy, would be obliged to raise the siege.\n\nBut as M. de Toiras gave information that everything was preparing in\nthe enemy's camp for a fresh assault, the king judged that it would be\nbest to put an end to the affair, and gave the necessary orders for a\ndecisive action.\n\nAs it is not our intention to give a journal of the siege, but on the\ncontrary only to describe such of the events of it as are connected with\nthe story we are relating, we will content ourselves with saying in two\nwords that the expedition succeeded, to the great astonishment of the\nking and the great glory of the cardinal. The English, repulsed foot by\nfoot, beaten in all encounters, and defeated in the passage of the Isle\nof Loie, were obliged to re-embark, leaving on the field of battle two\nthousand men, among whom were five colonels, three lieutenant colonels,\ntwo hundred and fifty captains, twenty gentlemen of rank, four pieces\nof cannon, and sixty flags, which were taken to Paris by Claude de St.\nSimon, and suspended with great pomp in the arches of Notre Dame.\n\nTe Deums were chanted in camp, and afterward throughout France.\n\nThe cardinal was left free to carry on the siege, without having, at\nleast at the present, anything to fear on the part of the English.\n\nBut it must be acknowledged, this response was but momentary. An envoy\nof the Duke of Buckingham, named Montague, was taken, and proof was\nobtained of a league between the German Empire, Spain, England, and\nLorraine. This league was directed against France.\n\nStill further, in Buckingham's lodging, which he had been forced to\nabandon more precipitately than he expected, papers were found which\nconfirmed this alliance and which, as the cardinal asserts in his\nmemoirs, strongly compromised Mme. de Chevreuse and consequently the\nqueen.\n\nIt was upon the cardinal that all the responsibility fell, for one is\nnot a despotic minister without responsibility. All, therefore, of the\nvast resources of his genius were at work night and day, engaged in\nlistening to the least report heard in any of the great kingdoms of\nEurope.\n\nThe cardinal was acquainted with the activity, and more particularly the\nhatred, of Buckingham. If the league which threatened France triumphed,\nall his influence would be lost. Spanish policy and Austrian policy\nwould have their representatives in the cabinet of the Louvre, where\nthey had as yet but partisans; and he, Richelieu--the French minister,\nthe national minister--would be ruined. The king, even while obeying him\nlike a child, hated him as a child hates his master, and would abandon\nhim to the personal vengeance of Monsieur and the queen. He would\nthen be lost, and France, perhaps, with him. All this must be prepared\nagainst.\n\nCourtiers, becoming every instant more numerous, succeeded one another,\nday and night, in the little house of the bridge of La Pierre, in which\nthe cardinal had established his residence.\n\nThere were monks who wore the frock with such an ill grace that it was\neasy to perceive they belonged to the church militant; women a little\ninconvenienced by their costume as pages and whose large trousers could\nnot entirely conceal their rounded forms; and peasants with blackened\nhands but with fine limbs, savoring of the man of quality a league off.\n\nThere were also less agreeable visits--for two or three times reports\nwere spread that the cardinal had nearly been assassinated.\n\nIt is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself\nwho set these bungling assassins to work, in order to have, if wanted,\nthe right of using reprisals; but we must not believe everything\nministers say, nor everything their enemies say.\n\nThese attempts did not prevent the cardinal, to whom his most inveterate\ndetractors have never denied personal bravery, from making nocturnal\nexcursions, sometimes to communicate to the Duc d'Angouleme important\norders, sometimes to confer with the king, and sometimes to have an\ninterview with a messenger whom he did not wish to see at home.\n\nOn their part the Musketeers, who had not much to do with the siege,\nwere not under very strict orders and led a joyous life. The was the\nmore easy for our three companions in particular; for being friends of\nM. de Treville, they obtained from him special permission to be absent\nafter the closing of the camp.\n\nNow, one evening when d'Artagnan, who was in the trenches, was not able\nto accompany them, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, mounted on their battle\nsteeds, enveloped in their war cloaks, with their hands upon their\npistol butts, were returning from a drinking place called the Red\nDovecot, which Athos had discovered two days before upon the route to\nJarrie, following the road which led to the camp and quite on their\nguard, as we have stated, for fear of an ambuscade, when, about a\nquarter of a league from the village of Boisnau, they fancied they heard\nthe sound of horses approaching them. They immediately all three halted,\nclosed in, and waited, occupying the middle of the road. In an instant,\nand as the moon broke from behind a cloud, they saw at a turning of\nthe road two horsemen who, on perceiving them, stopped in their turn,\nappearing to deliberate whether they should continue their route or go\nback. The hesitation created some suspicion in the three friends, and\nAthos, advancing a few paces in front of the others, cried in a firm\nvoice, \"Who goes there?\"\n\n\"Who goes there, yourselves?\" replied one of the horsemen.\n\n\"That is not an answer,\" replied Athos. \"Who goes there? Answer, or we\ncharge.\"\n\n\"Beware of what you are about, gentlemen!\" said a clear voice which\nseemed accustomed to command.\n\n\"It is some superior officer making his night rounds,\" said Athos. \"What\ndo you wish, gentlemen?\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" said the same voice, in the same commanding tone. \"Answer\nin your turn, or you may repent of your disobedience.\"\n\n\"King's Musketeers,\" said Athos, more and more convinced that he who\ninterrogated them had the right to do so.\n\n\"What company?\"\n\n\"Company of Treville.\"\n\n\"Advance, and give an account of what you are doing here at this hour.\"\n\nThe three companions advanced rather humbly--for all were now convinced\nthat they had to do with someone more powerful than themselves--leaving\nAthos the post of speaker.\n\nOne of the two riders, he who had spoken second, was ten paces in front\nof his companion. Athos made a sign to Porthos and Aramis also to remain\nin the rear, and advanced alone.\n\n\"Your pardon, my officer,\" said Athos; \"but we were ignorant with whom\nwe had to do, and you may see that we were good guard.\"\n\n\"Your name?\" said the officer, who covered a part of his face with his\ncloak.\n\n\"But yourself, monsieur,\" said Athos, who began to be annoyed by this\ninquisition, \"give me, I beg you, the proof that you have the right to\nquestion me.\"\n\n\"Your name?\" repeated the cavalier a second time, letting his cloak\nfall, and leaving his face uncovered.\n\n\"Monsieur the Cardinal!\" cried the stupefied Musketeer.\n\n\"Your name?\" cried his Eminence, for the third time.\n\n\"Athos,\" said the Musketeer.\n\nThe cardinal made a sign to his attendant, who drew near. \"These three\nMusketeers shall follow us,\" said he, in an undertone. \"I am not willing\nit should be known I have left the camp; and if they follow us we shall\nbe certain they will tell nobody.\"\n\n\"We are gentlemen, monseigneur,\" said Athos; \"require our parole, and\ngive yourself no uneasiness. Thank God, we can keep a secret.\"\n\nThe cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous speaker.\n\n\"You have a quick ear, Monsieur Athos,\" said the cardinal; \"but now\nlisten to this. It is not from mistrust that I request you to follow me,\nbut for my security. Your companions are no doubt Messieurs Porthos and\nAramis.\"\n\n\"Yes, your Eminence,\" said Athos, while the two Musketeers who had\nremained behind advanced hat in hand.\n\n\"I know you, gentlemen,\" said the cardinal, \"I know you. I know you are\nnot quite my friends, and I am sorry you are not so; but I know you are\nbrave and loyal gentlemen, and that confidence may be placed in you.\nMonsieur Athos, do me, then, the honor to accompany me; you and your two\nfriends, and then I shall have an escort to excite envy in his Majesty,\nif we should meet him.\"\n\nThe three Musketeers bowed to the necks of their horses.\n\n\"Well, upon my honor,\" said Athos, \"your Eminence is right in taking\nus with you; we have seen several ill-looking faces on the road, and we\nhave even had a quarrel at the Red Dovecot with four of those faces.\"\n\n\"A quarrel, and what for, gentlemen?\" said the cardinal; \"you know I\ndon't like quarrelers.\"\n\n\"And that is the reason why I have the honor to inform your Eminence of\nwhat has happened; for you might learn it from others, and upon a false\naccount believe us to be in fault.\"\n\n\"What have been the results of your quarrel?\" said the cardinal,\nknitting his brow.\n\n\"My friend, Aramis, here, has received a slight sword wound in the arm,\nbut not enough to prevent him, as your Eminence may see, from mounting\nto the assault tomorrow, if your Eminence orders an escalade.\"\n\n\"But you are not the men to allow sword wounds to be inflicted upon you\nthus,\" said the cardinal. \"Come, be frank, gentlemen, you have settled\naccounts with somebody! Confess; you know I have the right of giving\nabsolution.\"\n\n\"I, monseigneur?\" said Athos. \"I did not even draw my sword, but I took\nhim who offended me round the body, and threw him out of the window.\nIt appears that in falling,\" continued Athos, with some hesitation, \"he\nbroke his thigh.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" said the cardinal; \"and you, Monsieur Porthos?\"\n\n\"I, monseigneur, knowing that dueling is prohibited--I seized a bench,\nand gave one of those brigands such a blow that I believe his shoulder\nis broken.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the cardinal; \"and you, Monsieur Aramis?\"\n\n\"Monseigneur, being of a very mild disposition, and being, likewise, of\nwhich Monseigneur perhaps is not aware, about to enter into orders, I\nendeavored to appease my comrades, when one of these wretches gave me a\nwound with a sword, treacherously, across my left arm. Then I admit my\npatience failed me; I drew my sword in my turn, and as he came back to\nthe charge, I fancied I felt that in throwing himself upon me, he let it\npass through his body. I only know for a certainty that he fell; and it\nseemed to me that he was borne away with his two companions.\"\n\n\"The devil, gentlemen!\" said the cardinal, \"three men placed hors de\ncombat in a cabaret squabble! You don't do your work by halves. And pray\nwhat was this quarrel about?\"\n\n\"These fellows were drunk,\" said Athos, \"and knowing there was a lady\nwho had arrived at the cabaret this evening, they wanted to force her\ndoor.\"\n\n\"Force her door!\" said the cardinal, \"and for what purpose?\"\n\n\"To do her violence, without doubt,\" said Athos. \"I have had the honor\nof informing your Eminence that these men were drunk.\"\n\n\"And was this lady young and handsome?\" asked the cardinal, with a\ncertain degree of anxiety.\n\n\"We did not see her, monseigneur,\" said Athos.\n\n\"You did not see her? Ah, very well,\" replied the cardinal, quickly.\n\"You did well to defend the honor of a woman; and as I am going to the\nRed Dovecot myself, I shall know if you have told me the truth.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" said Athos, haughtily, \"we are gentlemen, and to save our\nheads we would not be guilty of a falsehood.\"\n\n\"Therefore I do not doubt what you say, Monsieur Athos, I do not doubt\nit for a single instant; but,\" added he, \"to change the conversation,\nwas this lady alone?\"\n\n\"The lady had a cavalier shut up with her,\" said Athos, \"but as\nnotwithstanding the noise, this cavalier did not show himself, it is to\nbe presumed that he is a coward.\"\n\n\"'Judge not rashly', says the Gospel,\" replied the cardinal.\n\nAthos bowed.\n\n\"And now, gentlemen, that's well,\" continued the cardinal. \"I know what\nI wish to know; follow me.\"\n\nThe three Musketeers passed behind his Eminence, who again enveloped his\nface in his cloak, and put his horse in motion, keeping from eight to\nten paces in advance of his four companions.\n\nThey soon arrived at the silent, solitary inn. No doubt the host\nknew what illustrious visitor was expected, and had consequently sent\nintruders out of the way.\n\nTen paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the\nthree Musketeers to halt. A saddled horse was fastened to the window\nshutter. The cardinal knocked three times, and in a peculiar manner.\n\nA man, enveloped in a cloak, came out immediately, and exchanged some\nrapid words with the cardinal; after which he mounted his horse, and set\noff in the direction of Surgeres, which was likewise the way to Paris.\n\n\"Advance, gentlemen,\" said the cardinal.\n\n\"You have told me the truth, my gentlemen,\" said he, addressing the\nMusketeers, \"and it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening\nbe not advantageous to you. In the meantime, follow me.\"\n\nThe cardinal alighted; the three Musketeers did likewise. The cardinal\nthrew the bridle of his horse to his esquire; the three Musketeers\nfastened the horses to the shutters.\n\nThe host stood at the door. For him, the cardinal was only an officer\ncoming to visit a lady.\n\n\"Have you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait\nnear a good fire?\" said the cardinal.\n\nThe host opened the door of a large room, in which an old stove had just\nbeen replaced by a large and excellent chimney.\n\n\"I have this,\" said he.\n\n\"That will do,\" replied the cardinal. \"Enter, gentlemen, and be kind\nenough to wait for me; I shall not be more than half an hour.\"\n\nAnd while the three Musketeers entered the ground floor room, the\ncardinal, without asking further information, ascended the staircase\nlike a man who has no need of having his road pointed out to him.\n\n\n\n\n44 THE UTILITY OF STOVEPIPES\n\nIt was evident that without suspecting it, and actuated solely by\ntheir chivalrous and adventurous character, our three friends had just\nrendered a service to someone the cardinal honored with his special\nprotection.\n\nNow, who was that someone? That was the question the three Musketeers\nput to one another. Then, seeing that none of their replies could throw\nany light on the subject, Porthos called the host and asked for dice.\n\nPorthos and Aramis placed themselves at the table and began to play.\nAthos walked about in a contemplative mood.\n\nWhile thinking and walking, Athos passed and repassed before the pipe\nof the stove, broken in halves, the other extremity passing into the\nchamber above; and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur\nof words, which at length fixed his attention. Athos went close to it,\nand distinguished some words that appeared to merit so great an interest\nthat he made a sign to his friends to be silent, remaining himself bent\nwith his ear directed to the opening of the lower orifice.\n\n\"Listen, Milady,\" said the cardinal, \"the affair is important. Sit down,\nand let us talk it over.\"\n\n\"Milady!\" murmured Athos.\n\n\"I listen to your Eminence with greatest attention,\" replied a female\nvoice which made the Musketeer start.\n\n\"A small vessel with an English crew, whose captain is on my side,\nawaits you at the mouth of Charente, at fort of the Point. He will set\nsail tomorrow morning.\"\n\n\"I must go thither tonight?\"\n\n\"Instantly! That is to say, when you have received my instructions.\nTwo men, whom you will find at the door on going out, will serve you as\nescort. You will allow me to leave first; then, after half an hour, you\ncan go away in your turn.\"\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur. Now let us return to the mission with which you wish\nto charge me; and as I desire to continue to merit the confidence of\nyour Eminence, deign to unfold it to me in terms clear and precise, that\nI may not commit an error.\"\n\nThere was an instant of profound silence between the two interlocutors.\nIt was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in\nwhich he was about to speak, and that Milady was collecting all her\nintellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say, and\nto engrave them in her memory when they should be spoken.\n\nAthos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten\nthe door inside, and to make them a sign to come and listen with him.\n\nThe two Musketeers, who loved their ease, brought a chair for each of\nthemselves and one for Athos. All three then sat down with their heads\ntogether and their ears on the alert.\n\n\"You will go to London,\" continued the cardinal. \"Arrived in London, you\nwill seek Buckingham.\"\n\n\"I must beg your Eminence to observe,\" said Milady, \"that since the\naffair of the diamond studs, about which the duke always suspected me,\nhis Grace distrusts me.\"\n\n\"Well, this time,\" said the cardinal, \"it is not necessary to steal\nhis confidence, but to present yourself frankly and loyally as a\nnegotiator.\"\n\n\"Frankly and loyally,\" repeated Milady, with an unspeakable expression\nof duplicity.\n\n\"Yes, frankly and loyally,\" replied the cardinal, in the same tone. \"All\nthis negotiation must be carried on openly.\"\n\n\"I will follow your Eminence's instructions to the letter. I only wait\ntill you give them.\"\n\n\"You will go to Buckingham in my behalf, and you will tell him I am\nacquainted with all the preparations he has made; but that they give me\nno uneasiness, since at the first step he takes I will ruin the queen.\"\n\n\"Will he believe that your Eminence is in a position to accomplish the\nthreat thus made?\"\n\n\"Yes; for I have the proofs.\"\n\n\"I must be able to present these proofs for his appreciation.\"\n\n\"Without doubt. And you will tell him I will publish the report of\nBois-Robert and the Marquis de Beautru, upon the interview which the\nduke had at the residence of Madame the Constable with the queen on the\nevening Madame the Constable gave a masquerade. You will tell him, in\norder that he may not doubt, that he came there in the costume of the\nGreat Mogul, which the Chevalier de Guise was to have worn, and that he\npurchased this exchange for the sum of three thousand pistoles.\"\n\n\"Well, monseigneur?\"\n\n\"All the details of his coming into and going out of the palace--on the\nnight when he introduced himself in the character of an Italian fortune\nteller--you will tell him, that he may not doubt the correctness of my\ninformation; that he had under his cloak a large white robe dotted with\nblack tears, death's heads, and crossbones--for in case of a surprise,\nhe was to pass for the phantom of the White Lady who, as all the world\nknows, appears at the Louvre every time any great event is impending.\"\n\n\"Is that all, monseigneur?\"\n\n\"Tell him also that I am acquainted with all the details of the\nadventure at Amiens; that I will have a little romance made of it,\nwittily turned, with a plan of the garden and portraits of the principal\nactors in that nocturnal romance.\"\n\n\"I will tell him that.\"\n\n\"Tell him further that I hold Montague in my power; that Montague is in\nthe Bastille; that no letters were found upon him, it is true, but that\ntorture may make him tell much of what he knows, and even what he does\nnot know.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"Then add that his Grace has, in the precipitation with which he quit\nthe Isle of Re, forgotten and left behind him in his lodging a certain\nletter from Madame de Chevreuse which singularly compromises the queen,\ninasmuch as it proves not only that her Majesty can love the enemies\nof the king but that she can conspire with the enemies of France. You\nrecollect perfectly all I have told you, do you not?\"\n\n\"Your Eminence will judge: the ball of Madame the Constable; the night\nat the Louvre; the evening at Amiens; the arrest of Montague; the letter\nof Madame de Chevreuse.\"\n\n\"That's it,\" said the cardinal, \"that's it. You have an excellent\nmemory, Milady.\"\n\n\"But,\" resumed she to whom the cardinal addressed this flattering\ncompliment, \"if, in spite of all these reasons, the duke does not give\nway and continues to menace France?\"\n\n\"The duke is in love to madness, or rather to folly,\" replied Richelieu,\nwith great bitterness. \"Like the ancient paladins, he has only\nundertaken this war to obtain a look from his lady love. If he becomes\ncertain that this war will cost the honor, and perhaps the liberty, of\nthe lady of his thoughts, as he says, I will answer for it he will look\ntwice.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" said Milady, with a persistence that proved she wished to\nsee clearly to the end of the mission with which she was about to be\ncharged, \"if he persists?\"\n\n\"If he persists?\" said the cardinal. \"That is not probable.\"\n\n\"It is possible,\" said Milady.\n\n\"If he persists--\" His Eminence made a pause, and resumed: \"If he\npersists--well, then I shall hope for one of those events which change\nthe destinies of states.\"\n\n\"If your Eminence would quote to me some one of these events in\nhistory,\" said Milady, \"perhaps I should partake of your confidence as\nto the future.\"\n\n\"Well, here, for example,\" said Richelieu: \"when, in 1610, for a cause\nsimilar to that which moves the duke, King Henry IV, of glorious memory,\nwas about, at the same time, to invade Flanders and Italy, in order to\nattack Austria on both sides. Well, did there not happen an event which\nsaved Austria? Why should not the king of France have the same chance as\nthe emperor?\"\n\n\"Your Eminence means, I presume, the knife stab in the Rue de la\nFeronnerie?\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" said the cardinal.\n\n\"Does not your Eminence fear that the punishment inflicted upon\nRavaillac may deter anyone who might entertain the idea of imitating\nhim?\"\n\n\"There will be, in all times and in all countries, particularly if\nreligious divisions exist in those countries, fanatics who ask nothing\nbetter than to become martyrs. Ay, and observe--it just occurs to me\nthat the Puritans are furious against Buckingham, and their preachers\ndesignate him as the Antichrist.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Milady.\n\n\"Well,\" continued the cardinal, in an indifferent tone, \"the only thing\nto be sought for at this moment is some woman, handsome, young, and\nclever, who has cause of quarrel with the duke. The duke has had many\naffairs of gallantry; and if he has fostered his amours by promises of\neternal constancy, he must likewise have sown the seeds of hatred by his\neternal infidelities.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" said Milady, coolly, \"such a woman may be found.\"\n\n\"Well, such a woman, who would place the knife of Jacques Clement or of\nRavaillac in the hands of a fanatic, would save France.\"\n\n\"Yes; but she would then be the accomplice of an assassination.\"\n\n\"Were the accomplices of Ravaillac or of Jacques Clement ever known?\"\n\n\"No; for perhaps they were too high-placed for anyone to dare look for\nthem where they were. The Palace of Justice would not be burned down for\neverybody, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"You think, then, that the fire at the Palace of Justice was not caused\nby chance?\" asked Richelieu, in the tone with which he would have put a\nquestion of no importance.\n\n\"I, monseigneur?\" replied Milady. \"I think nothing; I quote a fact, that\nis all. Only I say that if I were named Madame de Montpensier, or the\nQueen Marie de Medicis, I should use less precautions than I take, being\nsimply called Milady Clarik.\"\n\n\"That is just,\" said Richelieu. \"What do you require, then?\"\n\n\"I require an order which would ratify beforehand all that I should\nthink proper to do for the greatest good of France.\"\n\n\"But in the first place, this woman I have described must be found who\nis desirous of avenging herself upon the duke.\"\n\n\"She is found,\" said Milady.\n\n\"Then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an\ninstrument of God's justice.\"\n\n\"He will be found.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the cardinal, \"then it will be time to claim the order\nwhich you just now required.\"\n\n\"Your Eminence is right,\" replied Milady; \"and I have been wrong in\nseeing in the mission with which you honor me anything but that which\nit really is--that is, to announce to his Grace, on the part of your\nEminence, that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means\nof which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the fete given by\nMadame the Constable; that you have proofs of the interview granted at\nthe Louvre by the queen to a certain Italian astrologer who was no other\nthan the Duke of Buckingham; that you have ordered a little romance of\na satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of Amiens, with a\nplan of the gardens in which those adventures took place, and portraits\nof the actors who figured in them; that Montague is in the Bastille, and\nthat the torture may make him say things he remembers, and even things\nhe has forgotten; that you possess a certain letter from Madame de\nChevreuse, found in his Grace's lodging, which singularly compromises\nnot only her who wrote it, but her in whose name it was written. Then,\nif he persists, notwithstanding all this--as that is, as I have said,\nthe limit of my mission--I shall have nothing to do but to pray God\nto work a miracle for the salvation of France. That is it, is it not,\nmonseigneur, and I shall have nothing else to do?\"\n\n\"That is it,\" replied the cardinal, dryly.\n\n\"And now,\" said Milady, without appearing to remark the change of the\nduke's tone toward her--\"now that I have received the instructions of\nyour Eminence as concerns your enemies, Monseigneur will permit me to\nsay a few words to him of mine?\"\n\n\"Have you enemies, then?\" asked Richelieu.\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur, enemies against whom you owe me all your support, for\nI made them by serving your Eminence.\"\n\n\"Who are they?\" replied the duke.\n\n\"In the first place, there is a little intrigante named Bonacieux.\"\n\n\"She is in the prison of Nantes.\"\n\n\"That is to say, she was there,\" replied Milady; \"but the queen has\nobtained an order from the king by means of which she has been conveyed\nto a convent.\"\n\n\"To a convent?\" said the duke.\n\n\"Yes, to a convent.\"\n\n\"And to which?\"\n\n\"I don't know; the secret has been well kept.\"\n\n\"But I will know!\"\n\n\"And your Eminence will tell me in what convent that woman is?\"\n\n\"I can see nothing inconvenient in that,\" said the cardinal.\n\n\"Well, now I have an enemy much more to be dreaded by me than this\nlittle Madame Bonacieux.\"\n\n\"Who is that?\"\n\n\"Her lover.\"\n\n\"What is his name?\"\n\n\"Oh, your Eminence knows him well,\" cried Milady, carried away by\nher anger. \"He is the evil genius of both of us. It is he who in an\nencounter with your Eminence's Guards decided the victory in favor of\nthe king's Musketeers; it is he who gave three desperate wounds to de\nWardes, your emissary, and who caused the affair of the diamond studs\nto fail; it is he who, knowing it was I who had Madame Bonacieux carried\noff, has sworn my death.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" said the cardinal, \"I know of whom you speak.\"\n\n\"I mean that miserable d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"He is a bold fellow,\" said the cardinal.\n\n\"And it is exactly because he is a bold fellow that he is the more to be\nfeared.\"\n\n\"I must have,\" said the duke, \"a proof of his connection with\nBuckingham.\"\n\n\"A proof?\" cried Milady; \"I will have ten.\"\n\n\"Well, then, it becomes the simplest thing in the world; get me that\nproof, and I will send him to the Bastille.\"\n\n\"So far good, monseigneur; but afterwards?\"\n\n\"When once in the Bastille, there is no afterward!\" said the cardinal,\nin a low voice. \"Ah, pardieu!\" continued he, \"if it were as easy for me\nto get rid of my enemy as it is easy to get rid of yours, and if it were\nagainst such people you require impunity--\"\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" replied Milady, \"a fair exchange. Life for life, man for\nman; give me one, I will give you the other.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean, nor do I even desire to know what you\nmean,\" replied the cardinal; \"but I wish to please you, and see nothing\nout of the way in giving you what you demand with respect to so infamous\na creature--the more so as you tell me this d'Artagnan is a libertine, a\nduelist, and a traitor.\"\n\n\"An infamous scoundrel, monseigneur, a scoundrel!\"\n\n\"Give me paper, a quill, and some ink, then,\" said the cardinal.\n\n\"Here they are, monseigneur.\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence, which proved that the cardinal was\nemployed in seeking the terms in which he should write the note, or else\nin writing it. Athos, who had not lost a word of the conversation, took\nhis two companions by the hand, and led them to the other end of the\nroom.\n\n\"Well,\" said Porthos, \"what do you want, and why do you not let us\nlisten to the end of the conversation?\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Athos, speaking in a low voice. \"We have heard all it was\nnecessary we should hear; besides, I don't prevent you from listening,\nbut I must be gone.\"\n\n\"You must be gone!\" said Porthos; \"and if the cardinal asks for you,\nwhat answer can we make?\"\n\n\"You will not wait till he asks; you will speak first, and tell him that\nI am gone on the lookout, because certain expressions of our host have\ngiven me reason to think the road is not safe. I will say two words\nabout it to the cardinal's esquire likewise. The rest concerns myself;\ndon't be uneasy about that.\"\n\n\"Be prudent, Athos,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Be easy on that head,\" replied Athos; \"you know I am cool enough.\"\n\nPorthos and Aramis resumed their places by the stovepipe.\n\nAs to Athos, he went out without any mystery, took his horse, which was\ntied with those of his friends to the fastenings of the shutters, in\nfour words convinced the attendant of the necessity of a vanguard for\ntheir return, carefully examined the priming of his pistols, drew his\nsword, and took, like a forlorn hope, the road to the camp.\n\n\n\n\n45 A CONJUGAL SCENE\n\nAs Athos had foreseen, it was not long before the cardinal came down.\nHe opened the door of the room in which the Musketeers were, and found\nPorthos playing an earnest game of dice with Aramis. He cast a rapid\nglance around the room, and perceived that one of his men was missing.\n\n\"What has become of Monseigneur Athos?\" asked he.\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" replied Porthos, \"he has gone as a scout, on account of\nsome words of our host, which made him believe the road was not safe.\"\n\n\"And you, what have you done, Monsieur Porthos?\"\n\n\"I have won five pistoles of Aramis.\"\n\n\"Well; now will you return with me?\"\n\n\"We are at your Eminence's orders.\"\n\n\"To horse, then, gentlemen; for it is getting late.\"\n\nThe attendant was at the door, holding the cardinal's horse by the\nbridle. At a short distance a group of two men and three horses appeared\nin the shade. These were the two men who were to conduct Milady to the\nfort of the Point, and superintend her embarkation.\n\nThe attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two Musketeers had\nalready said with respect to Athos. The cardinal made an approving\ngesture, and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used\nincoming.\n\nLet us leave him to follow the road to the camp protected by his esquire\nand the two Musketeers, and return to Athos.\n\nFor a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started; but\nwhen out of sight he turned his horse to the right, made a circuit, and\ncame back within twenty paces of a high hedge to watch the passage of\nthe little troop. Having recognized the laced hats of his companions and\nthe golden fringe of the cardinal's cloak, he waited till the horsemen\nhad turned the angle of the road, and having lost sight of them,\nhe returned at a gallop to the inn, which was opened to him without\nhesitation.\n\nThe host recognized him.\n\n\"My officer,\" said Athos, \"has forgotten to give a piece of very\nimportant information to the lady, and has sent me back to repair his\nforgetfulness.\"\n\n\"Go up,\" said the host; \"she is still in her chamber.\"\n\nAthos availed himself of the permission, ascended the stairs with his\nlightest step, gained the landing, and through the open door perceived\nMilady putting on her hat.\n\nHe entered the chamber and closed the door behind him. At the noise he\nmade in pushing the bolt, Milady turned round.\n\nAthos was standing before the door, enveloped in his cloak, with his hat\npulled down over his eyes. On seeing this figure, mute and immovable as\na statue, Milady was frightened.\n\n\"Who are you, and what do you want?\" cried she.\n\n\"Humph,\" murmured Athos, \"it is certainly she!\"\n\nAnd letting fall his cloak and raising his hat, he advanced toward\nMilady.\n\n\"Do you know me, madame?\" said he.\n\nMilady made one step forward, and then drew back as if she had seen a\nserpent.\n\n\"So far, well,\" said Athos, \"I perceive you know me.\"\n\n\"The Comte de la Fere!\" murmured Milady, becoming exceedingly pale, and\ndrawing back till the wall prevented her from going any farther.\n\n\"Yes, Milady,\" replied Athos; \"the Comte de la Fere in person, who comes\nexpressly from the other world to have the pleasure of paying you a\nvisit. Sit down, madame, and let us talk, as the cardinal said.\"\n\nMilady, under the influence of inexpressible terror, sat down without\nuttering a word.\n\n\"You certainly are a demon sent upon the earth!\" said Athos. \"Your power\nis great, I know; but you also know that with the help of God men have\noften conquered the most terrible demons. You have once before thrown\nyourself in my path. I thought I had crushed you, madame; but either I\nwas deceived or hell has resuscitated you!\"\n\nMilady at these words, which recalled frightful remembrances, hung down\nher head with a suppressed groan.\n\n\"Yes, hell has resuscitated you,\" continued Athos. \"Hell has made you\nrich, hell has given you another name, hell has almost made you another\nface; but it has neither effaced the stains from your soul nor the brand\nfrom your body.\"\n\nMilady arose as if moved by a powerful spring, and her eyes flashed\nlightning. Athos remained sitting.\n\n\"You believed me to be dead, did you not, as I believed you to be? And\nthe name of Athos as well concealed the Comte de la Fere, as the name\nMilady Clarik concealed Anne de Breuil. Was it not so you were called\nwhen your honored brother married us? Our position is truly a strange\none,\" continued Athos, laughing. \"We have only lived up to the present\ntime because we believed each other dead, and because a remembrance\nis less oppressive than a living creature, though a remembrance is\nsometimes devouring.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Milady, in a hollow, faint voice, \"what brings you back to\nme, and what do you want with me?\"\n\n\"I wish to tell you that though remaining invisible to your eyes, I have\nnot lost sight of you.\"\n\n\"You know what I have done?\"\n\n\"I can relate to you, day by day, your actions from your entrance to the\nservice of the cardinal to this evening.\"\n\nA smile of incredulity passed over the pale lips of Milady.\n\n\"Listen! It was you who cut off the two diamond studs from the shoulder\nof the Duke of Buckingham; it was you had the Madame Bonacieux carried\noff; it was you who, in love with de Wardes and thinking to pass the\nnight with him, opened the door to Monsieur d'Artagnan; it was you who,\nbelieving that de Wardes had deceived you, wished to have him killed by\nhis rival; it was you who, when this rival had discovered your infamous\nsecret, wished to have him killed in his turn by two assassins, whom\nyou sent in pursuit of him; it was you who, finding the balls had missed\ntheir mark, sent poisoned wine with a forged letter, to make your victim\nbelieve that the wine came from his friends. In short, it was you who\nhave but now in this chamber, seated in this chair I now fill, made an\nengagement with Cardinal Richelieu to cause the Duke of Buckingham to be\nassassinated, in exchange for the promise he has made you to allow you\nto assassinate d'Artagnan.\"\n\nMilady was livid.\n\n\"You must be Satan!\" cried she.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Athos; \"But at all events listen well to this.\nAssassinate the Duke of Buckingham, or cause him to be assassinated--I\ncare very little about that! I don't know him. Besides, he is an\nEnglishman. But do not touch with the tip of your finger a single hair\nof d'Artagnan, who is a faithful friend whom I love and defend, or I\nswear to you by the head of my father the crime which you shall have\nendeavored to commit, or shall have committed, shall be the last.\"\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan has cruelly insulted me,\" said Milady, in a hollow\ntone; \"Monsieur d'Artagnan shall die!\"\n\n\"Indeed! Is it possible to insult you, madame?\" said Athos, laughing;\n\"he has insulted you, and he shall die!\"\n\n\"He shall die!\" replied Milady; \"she first, and he afterward.\"\n\nAthos was seized with a kind of vertigo. The sight of this creature,\nwho had nothing of the woman about her, recalled awful remembrances. He\nthought how one day, in a less dangerous situation than the one in which\nhe was now placed, he had already endeavored to sacrifice her to his\nhonor. His desire for blood returned, burning his brain and pervading\nhis frame like a raging fever; he arose in his turn, reached his hand to\nhis belt, drew forth a pistol, and cocked it.\n\nMilady, pale as a corpse, endeavored to cry out; but her swollen tongue\ncould utter no more than a hoarse sound which had nothing human in it\nand resembled the rattle of a wild beast. Motionless against the dark\ntapestry, with her hair in disorder, she appeared like a horrid image of\nterror.\n\nAthos slowly raised his pistol, stretched out his arm so that the weapon\nalmost touched Milady's forehead, and then, in a voice the more terrible\nfrom having the supreme calmness of a fixed resolution, \"Madame,\" said\nhe, \"you will this instant deliver to me the paper the cardinal signed;\nor upon my soul, I will blow your brains out.\"\n\nWith another man, Milady might have preserved some doubt; but she knew\nAthos. Nevertheless, she remained motionless.\n\n\"You have one second to decide,\" said he.\n\nMilady saw by the contraction of his countenance that the trigger was\nabout to be pulled; she reached her hand quickly to her bosom, drew out\na paper, and held it toward Athos.\n\n\"Take it,\" said she, \"and be accursed!\"\n\nAthos took the paper, returned the pistol to his belt, approached the\nlamp to be assured that it was the paper, unfolded it, and read:\n\n\nDec. 3, 1627\n\nIt is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this\nhas done what he has done.\n\nRichelieu\n\n\n\"And now,\" said Athos, resuming his cloak and putting on his hat, \"now\nthat I have drawn your teeth, viper, bite if you can.\"\n\nAnd he left the chamber without once looking behind him.\n\nAt the door he found the two men and the spare horse which they held.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"Monseigneur's order is, you know, to conduct that\nwoman, without losing time, to the fort of the Point, and never to leave\nher till she is on board.\"\n\nAs these words agreed wholly with the order they had received, they\nbowed their heads in sign of assent.\n\nWith regard to Athos, he leaped lightly into the saddle and set out\nat full gallop; only instead of following the road, he went across the\nfields, urging his horse to the utmost and stopping occasionally to\nlisten.\n\nIn one of those halts he heard the steps of several horses on the road.\nHe had no doubt it was the cardinal and his escort. He immediately made\na new point in advance, rubbed his horse down with some heath and leaves\nof trees, and placed himself across the road, about two hundred paces\nfrom the camp.\n\n\"Who goes there?\" cried he, as soon as he perceived the horsemen.\n\n\"That is our brave Musketeer, I think,\" said the cardinal.\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur,\" said Porthos, \"it is he.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Athos,\" said Richelieu, \"receive my thanks for the good guard\nyou have kept. Gentlemen, we are arrived; take the gate on the left. The\nwatchword is, 'King and Re.'\"\n\nSaying these words, the cardinal saluted the three friends with an\ninclination of his head, and took the right hand, followed by his\nattendant--for that night he himself slept in the camp.\n\n\"Well!\" said Porthos and Aramis together, as soon as the cardinal was\nout of hearing, \"well, he signed the paper she required!\"\n\n\"I know it,\" said Athos, coolly, \"since here it is.\"\n\nAnd the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached\ntheir quarters, except to give the watchword to the sentinels. Only\nthey sent Mousqueton to tell Planchet that his master was requested,\nthe instant that he left the trenches, to come to the quarters of the\nMusketeers.\n\nMilady, as Athos had foreseen, on finding the two men that awaited her,\nmade no difficulty in following them. She had had for an instant an\ninclination to be reconducted to the cardinal, and relate everything to\nhim; but a revelation on her part would bring about a revelation on the\npart of Athos. She might say that Athos had hanged her; but then Athos\nwould tell that she was branded. She thought it was best to preserve\nsilence, to discreetly set off to accomplish her difficult mission\nwith her usual skill; and then, all things being accomplished to the\nsatisfaction of the cardinal, to come to him and claim her vengeance.\n\nIn consequence, after having traveled all night, at seven o'clock she\nwas at the fort of the Point; at eight o'clock she had embarked; and\nat nine, the vessel, which with letters of marque from the cardinal\nwas supposed to be sailing for Bayonne, raised anchor, and steered its\ncourse toward England.\n\n\n\n\n46 THE BASTION SAINT-GERVAIS\n\nOn arriving at the lodgings of his three friends, d'Artagnan found\nthem assembled in the same chamber. Athos was meditating; Porthos was\ntwisting his mustache; Aramis was saying his prayers in a charming\nlittle Book of Hours, bound in blue velvet.\n\n\"Pardieu, gentlemen,\" said he. \"I hope what you have to tell me is worth\nthe trouble, or else, I warn you, I will not pardon you for making me\ncome here instead of getting a little rest after a night spent in taking\nand dismantling a bastion. Ah, why were you not there, gentlemen? It was\nwarm work.\"\n\n\"We were in a place where it was not very cold,\" replied Porthos, giving\nhis mustache a twist which was peculiar to him.\n\n\"Hush!\" said Athos.\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" said d'Artagnan, comprehending the slight frown of the\nMusketeer. \"It appears there is something fresh aboard.\"\n\n\"Aramis,\" said Athos, \"you went to breakfast the day before yesterday at\nthe inn of the Parpaillot, I believe?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"How did you fare?\"\n\n\"For my part, I ate but little. The day before yesterday was a fish day,\nand they had nothing but meat.\"\n\n\"What,\" said Athos, \"no fish at a seaport?\"\n\n\"They say,\" said Aramis, resuming his pious reading, \"that the dyke\nwhich the cardinal is making drives them all out into the open sea.\"\n\n\"But that is not quite what I mean to ask you, Aramis,\" replied Athos.\n\"I want to know if you were left alone, and nobody interrupted you.\"\n\n\"Why, I think there were not many intruders. Yes, Athos, I know what you\nmean: we shall do very well at the Parpaillot.\"\n\n\"Let us go to the Parpaillot, then, for here the walls are like sheets\nof paper.\"\n\nD'Artagnan, who was accustomed to his friend's manner of acting, and who\nperceived immediately, by a word, a gesture, or a sign from him, that\nthe circumstances were serious, took Athos's arm, and went out without\nsaying anything. Porthos followed, chatting with Aramis.\n\nOn their way they met Grimaud. Athos made him a sign to come with them.\nGrimaud, according to custom, obeyed in silence; the poor lad had nearly\ncome to the pass of forgetting how to speak.\n\nThey arrived at the drinking room of the Parpaillot. It was seven\no'clock in the morning, and daylight began to appear. The three friends\nordered breakfast, and went into a room in which the host said they\nwould not be disturbed.\n\nUnfortunately, the hour was badly chosen for a private conference. The\nmorning drum had just been beaten; everyone shook off the drowsiness of\nnight, and to dispel the humid morning air, came to take a drop at the\ninn. Dragoons, Swiss, Guardsmen, Musketeers, light-horsemen, succeeded\none another with a rapidity which might answer the purpose of the host\nvery well, but agreed badly with the views of the four friends. Thus\nthey applied very curtly to the salutations, healths, and jokes of their\ncompanions.\n\n\"I see how it will be,\" said Athos: \"we shall get into some pretty\nquarrel or other, and we have no need of one just now. D'Artagnan,\ntell us what sort of a night you have had, and we will describe ours\nafterward.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" said a light-horseman, with a glass of brandy in his hand,\nwhich he sipped slowly. \"I hear you gentlemen of the Guards have been\nin the trenches tonight, and that you did not get much the best of the\nRochellais.\"\n\nD'Artagnan looked at Athos to know if he ought to reply to this intruder\nwho thus mixed unasked in their conversation.\n\n\"Well,\" said Athos, \"don't you hear Monsieur de Busigny, who does you\nthe honor to ask you a question? Relate what has passed during the\nnight, since these gentlemen desire to know it.\"\n\n\"Have you not taken a bastion?\" said a Swiss, who was drinking rum out\nof a beer glass.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" said d'Artagnan, bowing, \"we have had that honor. We\neven have, as you may have heard, introduced a barrel of powder under\none of the angles, which in blowing up made a very pretty breach.\nWithout reckoning that as the bastion was not built yesterday all the\nrest of the building was badly shaken.\"\n\n\"And what bastion is it?\" asked a dragoon, with his saber run through a\ngoose which he was taking to be cooked.\n\n\"The bastion St. Gervais,\" replied d'Artagnan, \"from behind which the\nRochellais annoyed our workmen.\"\n\n\"Was that affair hot?\"\n\n\"Yes, moderately so. We lost five men, and the Rochellais eight or ten.\"\n\n\"Balzempleu!\" said the Swiss, who, notwithstanding the admirable\ncollection of oaths possessed by the German language, had acquired a\nhabit of swearing in French.\n\n\"But it is probable,\" said the light-horseman, \"that they will send\npioneers this morning to repair the bastion.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's probable,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Athos, \"a wager!\"\n\n\"Ah, wooi, a vager!\" cried the Swiss.\n\n\"What is it?\" said the light-horseman.\n\n\"Stop a bit,\" said the dragoon, placing his saber like a spit upon the\ntwo large iron dogs which held the firebrands in the chimney, \"stop a\nbit, I am in it. You cursed host! a dripping pan immediately, that I may\nnot lose a drop of the fat of this estimable bird.\"\n\n\"You was right,\" said the Swiss; \"goose grease is kood with basdry.\"\n\n\"There!\" said the dragoon. \"Now for the wager! We listen, Monsieur\nAthos.\"\n\n\"Yes, the wager!\" said the light-horseman.\n\n\"Well, Monsieur de Busigny, I will bet you,\" said Athos, \"that my three\ncompanions, Messieurs Porthos, Aramis, and d'Artagnan, and myself, will\ngo and breakfast in the bastion St. Gervais, and we will remain there an\nhour, by the watch, whatever the enemy may do to dislodge us.\"\n\nPorthos and Aramis looked at each other; they began to comprehend.\n\n\"But,\" said d'Artagnan, in the ear of Athos, \"you are going to get us\nall killed without mercy.\"\n\n\"We are much more likely to be killed,\" said Athos, \"if we do not go.\"\n\n\"My faith, gentlemen,\" said Porthos, turning round upon his chair and\ntwisting his mustache, \"that's a fair bet, I hope.\"\n\n\"I take it,\" said M. de Busigny; \"so let us fix the stake.\"\n\n\"You are four gentlemen,\" said Athos, \"and we are four; an unlimited\ndinner for eight. Will that do?\"\n\n\"Capitally,\" replied M. de Busigny.\n\n\"Perfectly,\" said the dragoon.\n\n\"That shoots me,\" said the Swiss.\n\nThe fourth auditor, who during all this conversation had played a\nmute part, made a sign of the head in proof that he acquiesced in the\nproposition.\n\n\"The breakfast for these gentlemen is ready,\" said the host.\n\n\"Well, bring it,\" said Athos.\n\nThe host obeyed. Athos called Grimaud, pointed to a large basket which\nlay in a corner, and made a sign to him to wrap the viands up in the\nnapkins.\n\nGrimaud understood that it was to be a breakfast on the grass, took\nthe basket, packed up the viands, added the bottles, and then took the\nbasket on his arm.\n\n\"But where are you going to eat my breakfast?\" asked the host.\n\n\"What matter, if you are paid for it?\" said Athos, and he threw two\npistoles majestically on the table.\n\n\"Shall I give you the change, my officer?\" said the host.\n\n\"No, only add two bottles of champagne, and the difference will be for\nthe napkins.\"\n\nThe host had not quite so good a bargain as he at first hoped for, but\nhe made amends by slipping in two bottles of Anjou wine instead of two\nbottles of champagne.\n\n\"Monsieur de Busigny,\" said Athos, \"will you be so kind as to set your\nwatch with mine, or permit me to regulate mine by yours?\"\n\n\"Which you please, monsieur!\" said the light-horseman, drawing from his\nfob a very handsome watch, studded with diamonds; \"half past seven.\"\n\n\"Thirty-five minutes after seven,\" said Athos, \"by which you perceive I\nam five minutes faster than you.\"\n\nAnd bowing to all the astonished persons present, the young men took the\nroad to the bastion St. Gervais, followed by Grimaud, who carried the\nbasket, ignorant of where he was going but in the passive obedience\nwhich Athos had taught him not even thinking of asking.\n\nAs long as they were within the circle of the camp, the four friends did\nnot exchange one word; besides, they were followed by the curious, who,\nhearing of the wager, were anxious to know how they would come out of\nit. But when once they passed the line of circumvallation and found\nthemselves in the open plain, d'Artagnan, who was completely ignorant of\nwhat was going forward, thought it was time to demand an explanation.\n\n\"And now, my dear Athos,\" said he, \"do me the kindness to tell me where\nwe are going?\"\n\n\"Why, you see plainly enough we are going to the bastion.\"\n\n\"But what are we going to do there?\"\n\n\"You know well that we go to breakfast there.\"\n\n\"But why did we not breakfast at the Parpaillot?\"\n\n\"Because we have very important matters to communicate to one another,\nand it was impossible to talk five minutes in that inn without being\nannoyed by all those importunate fellows, who keep coming in, saluting\nyou, and addressing you. Here at least,\" said Athos, pointing to the\nbastion, \"they will not come and disturb us.\"\n\n\"It appears to me,\" said d'Artagnan, with that prudence which allied\nitself in him so naturally with excessive bravery, \"that we could have\nfound some retired place on the downs or the seashore.\"\n\n\"Where we should have been seen all four conferring together, so that at\nthe end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by\nhis spies that we were holding a council.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Aramis, \"Athos is right: ANIMADVERTUNTUR IN DESERTIS.\"\n\n\"A desert would not have been amiss,\" said Porthos; \"but it behooved us\nto find it.\"\n\n\"There is no desert where a bird cannot pass over one's head, where a\nfish cannot leap out of the water, where a rabbit cannot come out of its\nburrow, and I believe that bird, fish, and rabbit each becomes a spy of\nthe cardinal. Better, then, pursue our enterprise; from which, besides,\nwe cannot retreat without shame. We have made a wager--a wager which\ncould not have been foreseen, and of which I defy anyone to divine the\ntrue cause. We are going, in order to win it, to remain an hour in the\nbastion. Either we shall be attacked, or not. If we are not, we shall\nhave all the time to talk, and nobody will hear us--for I guarantee\nthe walls of the bastion have no ears; if we are, we will talk of our\naffairs just the same. Moreover, in defending ourselves, we shall cover\nourselves with glory. You see that everything is to our advantage.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said d'Artagnan; \"but we shall indubitably attract a ball.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear,\" replied Athos, \"you know well that the balls most to be\ndreaded are not from the enemy.\"\n\n\"But for such an expedition we surely ought to have brought our\nmuskets.\"\n\n\"You are stupid, friend Porthos. Why should we load ourselves with a\nuseless burden?\"\n\n\"I don't find a good musket, twelve cartridges, and a powder flask very\nuseless in the face of an enemy.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Athos, \"have you not heard what d'Artagnan said?\"\n\n\"What did he say?\" demanded Porthos.\n\n\"d'Artagnan said that in the attack of last night eight or ten Frenchmen\nwere killed, and as many Rochellais.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"The bodies were not plundered, were they? It appears the conquerors had\nsomething else to do.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, we shall find their muskets, their cartridges, and their flasks;\nand instead of four musketoons and twelve balls, we shall have fifteen\nguns and a hundred charges to fire.\"\n\n\"Oh, Athos!\" said Aramis, \"truly you are a great man.\"\n\nPorthos nodded in sign of agreement. D'Artagnan alone did not seem\nconvinced.\n\nGrimaud no doubt shared the misgivings of the young man, for seeing that\nthey continued to advance toward the bastion--something he had till then\ndoubted--he pulled his master by the skirt of his coat.\n\n\"Where are we going?\" asked he, by a gesture.\n\nAthos pointed to the bastion.\n\n\"But,\" said Grimaud, in the same silent dialect, \"we shall leave our\nskins there.\"\n\nAthos raised his eyes and his finger toward heaven.\n\nGrimaud put his basket on the ground and sat down with a shake of the\nhead.\n\nAthos took a pistol from his belt, looked to see if it was properly\nprimed, cocked it, and placed the muzzle close to Grimaud's ear.\n\nGrimaud was on his legs again as if by a spring. Athos then made him\na sign to take up his basket and to walk on first. Grimaud obeyed. All\nthat Grimaud gained by this momentary pantomime was to pass from the\nrear guard to the vanguard.\n\nArrived at the bastion, the four friends turned round.\n\nMore than three hundred soldiers of all kinds were assembled at the\ngate of the camp; and in a separate group might be distinguished M. de\nBusigny, the dragoon, the Swiss, and the fourth bettor.\n\nAthos took off his hat, placed it on the end of his sword, and waved it\nin the air.\n\nAll the spectators returned him his salute, accompanying this courtesy\nwith a loud hurrah which was audible to the four; after which all four\ndisappeared in the bastion, whither Grimaud had preceded them.\n\n\n\n\n47 THE COUNCIL OF THE MUSKETEERS\n\nAs Athos had foreseen, the bastion was only occupied by a dozen corpses,\nFrench and Rochellais.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Athos, who had assumed the command of the expedition,\n\"while Grimaud spreads the table, let us begin by collecting the guns\nand cartridges together. We can talk while performing that necessary\ntask. These gentlemen,\" added he, pointing to the bodies, \"cannot hear\nus.\"\n\n\"But we could throw them into the ditch,\" said Porthos, \"after having\nassured ourselves they have nothing in their pockets.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Athos, \"that's Grimaud's business.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" cried d'Artagnan, \"pray let Grimaud search them and throw\nthem over the walls.\"\n\n\"Heaven forfend!\" said Athos; \"they may serve us.\"\n\n\"These bodies serve us?\" said Porthos. \"You are mad, dear friend.\"\n\n\"Judge not rashly, say the gospel and the cardinal,\" replied Athos. \"How\nmany guns, gentlemen?\"\n\n\"Twelve,\" replied Aramis.\n\n\"How many shots?\"\n\n\"A hundred.\"\n\n\"That's quite as many as we shall want. Let us load the guns.\"\n\nThe four Musketeers went to work; and as they were loading the last\nmusket Grimaud announced that the breakfast was ready.\n\nAthos replied, always by gestures, that that was well, and indicated to\nGrimaud, by pointing to a turret that resembled a pepper caster, that\nhe was to stand as sentinel. Only, to alleviate the tediousness of the\nduty, Athos allowed him to take a loaf, two cutlets, and a bottle of\nwine.\n\n\"And now to table,\" said Athos.\n\nThe four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs crossed\nlike Turks, or even tailors.\n\n\"And now,\" said d'Artagnan, \"as there is no longer any fear of being\noverheard, I hope you are going to let me into your secret.\"\n\n\"I hope at the same time to procure you amusement and glory, gentlemen,\"\nsaid Athos. \"I have induced you to take a charming promenade; here is a\ndelicious breakfast; and yonder are five hundred persons, as you may see\nthrough the loopholes, taking us for heroes or madmen--two classes of\nimbeciles greatly resembling each other.\"\n\n\"But the secret!\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"The secret is,\" said Athos, \"that I saw Milady last night.\"\n\nD'Artagnan was lifting a glass to his lips; but at the name of Milady,\nhis hand trembled so, that he was obliged to put the glass on the ground\nagain for fear of spilling the contents.\"\n\n\"You saw your wi--\"\n\n\"Hush!\" interrupted Athos. \"You forget, my dear, you forget that these\ngentlemen are not initiated into my family affairs like yourself. I have\nseen Milady.\"\n\n\"Where?\" demanded d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Within two leagues of this place, at the inn of the Red Dovecot.\"\n\n\"In that case I am lost,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Not so bad yet,\" replied Athos; \"for by this time she must have quit\nthe shores of France.\"\n\nD'Artagnan breathed again.\n\n\"But after all,\" asked Porthos, \"who is Milady?\"\n\n\"A charming woman!\" said Athos, sipping a glass of sparkling wine.\n\"Villainous host!\" cried he, \"he has given us Anjou wine instead\nof champagne, and fancies we know no better! Yes,\" continued he, \"a\ncharming woman, who entertained kind views toward our friend d'Artagnan,\nwho, on his part, has given her some offense for which she tried to\nrevenge herself a month ago by having him killed by two musket shots, a\nweek ago by trying to poison him, and yesterday by demanding his head of\nthe cardinal.\"\n\n\"What! by demanding my head of the cardinal?\" cried d'Artagnan, pale\nwith terror.\n\n\"Yes, that is true as the Gospel,\" said Porthos; \"I heard her with my\nown ears.\"\n\n\"I also,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Then,\" said d'Artagnan, letting his arm fall with discouragement, \"it\nis useless to struggle longer. I may as well blow my brains out, and all\nwill be over.\"\n\n\"That's the last folly to be committed,\" said Athos, \"seeing it is the\nonly one for which there is no remedy.\"\n\n\"But I can never escape,\" said d'Artagnan, \"with such enemies. First,\nmy stranger of Meung; then de Wardes, to whom I have given three sword\nwounds; next Milady, whose secret I have discovered; finally, the\ncardinal, whose vengeance I have balked.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Athos, \"that only makes four; and we are four--one for one.\nPardieu! if we may believe the signs Grimaud is making, we are about to\nhave to do with a very different number of people. What is it, Grimaud?\nConsidering the gravity of the occasion, I permit you to speak, my\nfriend; but be laconic, I beg. What do you see?\"\n\n\"A troop.\"\n\n\"Of how many persons?\"\n\n\"Twenty men.\"\n\n\"What sort of men?\"\n\n\"Sixteen pioneers, four soldiers.\"\n\n\"How far distant?\"\n\n\"Five hundred paces.\"\n\n\"Good! We have just time to finish this fowl and to drink one glass of\nwine to your health, d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"To your health!\" repeated Porthos and Aramis.\n\n\"Well, then, to my health! although I am very much afraid that your good\nwishes will not be of great service to me.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said Athos, \"God is great, as say the followers of Mohammed, and\nthe future is in his hands.\"\n\nThen, swallowing the contents of his glass, which he put down close to\nhim, Athos arose carelessly, took the musket next to him, and drew near\nto one of the loopholes.\n\nPorthos, Aramis and d'Artagnan followed his example. As to Grimaud, he\nreceived orders to place himself behind the four friends in order to\nreload their weapons.\n\n\"Pardieu!\" said Athos, \"it was hardly worth while to distribute\nourselves for twenty fellows armed with pickaxes, mattocks, and shovels.\nGrimaud had only to make them a sign to go away, and I am convinced they\nwould have left us in peace.\"\n\n\"I doubt that,\" replied d'Artagnan, \"for they are advancing very\nresolutely. Besides, in addition to the pioneers, there are four\nsoldiers and a brigadier, armed with muskets.\"\n\n\"That's because they don't see us,\" said Athos.\n\n\"My faith,\" said Aramis, \"I must confess I feel a great repugnance to\nfire on these poor devils of civilians.\"\n\n\"He is a bad priest,\" said Porthos, \"who has pity for heretics.\"\n\n\"In truth,\" said Athos, \"Aramis is right. I will warn them.\"\n\n\"What the devil are you going to do?\" cried d'Artagnan, \"you will be\nshot.\"\n\nBut Athos heeded not his advice. Mounting on the breach, with his musket\nin one hand and his hat in the other, he said, bowing courteously\nand addressing the soldiers and the pioneers, who, astonished at this\napparition, stopped fifty paces from the bastion: \"Gentlemen, a few\nfriends and myself are about to breakfast in this bastion. Now, you\nknow nothing is more disagreeable than being disturbed when one is at\nbreakfast. We request you, then, if you really have business here, to\nwait till we have finished or repast, or to come again a short time\nhence, unless; unless, which would be far better, you form the salutary\nresolution to quit the side of the rebels, and come and drink with us to\nthe health of the King of France.\"\n\n\"Take care, Athos!\" cried d'Artagnan; \"don't you see they are aiming?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Athos; \"but they are only civilians--very bad marksmen,\nwho will be sure not to hit me.\"\n\nIn fact, at the same instant four shots were fired, and the balls were\nflattened against the wall around Athos, but not one touched him.\n\nFour shots replied to them almost instantaneously, but much better aimed\nthan those of the aggressors; three soldiers fell dead, and one of the\npioneers was wounded.\n\n\"Grimaud,\" said Athos, still on the breach, \"another musket!\"\n\nGrimaud immediately obeyed. On their part, the three friends had\nreloaded their arms; a second discharge followed the first. The\nbrigadier and two pioneers fell dead; the rest of the troop took to\nflight.\n\n\"Now, gentlemen, a sortie!\" cried Athos.\n\nAnd the four friends rushed out of the fort, gained the field of battle,\npicked up the four muskets of the privates and the half-pike of the\nbrigadier, and convinced that the fugitives would not stop till they\nreached the city, turned again toward the bastion, bearing with them the\ntrophies of their victory.\n\n\"Reload the muskets, Grimaud,\" said Athos, \"and we, gentlemen, will go\non with our breakfast, and resume our conversation. Where were we?\"\n\n\"I recollect you were saying,\" said d'Artagnan, \"that after having\ndemanded my head of the cardinal, Milady had quit the shores of France.\nWhither goes she?\" added he, strongly interested in the route Milady\nfollowed.\n\n\"She goes into England,\" said Athos.\n\n\"With what view?\"\n\n\"With the view of assassinating, or causing to be assassinated, the Duke\nof Buckingham.\"\n\nD'Artagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and indignation.\n\n\"But this is infamous!\" cried he.\n\n\"As to that,\" said Athos, \"I beg you to believe that I care very little\nabout it. Now you have done, Grimaud, take our brigadier's half-pike,\ntie a napkin to it, and plant it on top of our bastion, that these\nrebels of Rochellais may see that they have to deal with brave and loyal\nsoldiers of the king.\"\n\nGrimaud obeyed without replying. An instant afterward, the white flag\nwas floating over the heads of the four friends. A thunder of applause\nsaluted its appearance; half the camp was at the barrier.\n\n\"How?\" replied d'Artagnan, \"you care little if she kills Buckingham or\ncauses him to be killed? But the duke is our friend.\"\n\n\"The duke is English; the duke fights against us. Let her do what she\nlikes with the duke; I care no more about him than an empty bottle.\"\nAnd Athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he had\npoured the last drop into his glass.\n\n\"A moment,\" said d'Artagnan. \"I will not abandon Buckingham thus. He\ngave us some very fine horses.\"\n\n\"And moreover, very handsome saddles,\" said Porthos, who at the moment\nwore on his cloak the lace of his own.\n\n\"Besides,\" said Aramis, \"God desires the conversion and not the death of\na sinner.\"\n\n\"Amen!\" said Athos, \"and we will return to that subject later, if such\nbe your pleasure; but what for the moment engaged my attention most\nearnestly, and I am sure you will understand me, d'Artagnan, was the\ngetting from this woman a kind of carte blanche which she had extorted\nfrom the cardinal, and by means of which she could with impunity get rid\nof you and perhaps of us.\"\n\n\"But this creature must be a demon!\" said Porthos, holding out his plate\nto Aramis, who was cutting up a fowl.\n\n\"And this carte blanche,\" said d'Artagnan, \"this carte blanche, does it\nremain in her hands?\"\n\n\"No, it passed into mine; I will not say without trouble, for if I did I\nshould tell a lie.\"\n\n\"My dear Athos, I shall no longer count the number of times I am\nindebted to you for my life.\"\n\n\"Then it was to go to her that you left us?\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"And you have that letter of the cardinal?\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Here it is,\" said Athos; and he took the invaluable paper from the\npocket of his uniform. D'Artagnan unfolded it with one hand, whose\ntrembling he did not even attempt to conceal, to read:\n\n\nDec. 3, 1627\n\nIt is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this\nhas done what he has done.\n\n\"Richelieu\"\n\n\n\"In fact,\" said Aramis, \"it is an absolution according to rule.\"\n\n\"That paper must be torn to pieces,\" said d'Artagnan, who fancied he\nread in it his sentence of death.\n\n\"On the contrary,\" said Athos, \"it must be preserved carefully. I would\nnot give up this paper if covered with as many gold pieces.\"\n\n\"And what will she do now?\" asked the young man.\n\n\"Why,\" replied Athos, carelessly, \"she is probably going to write to\nthe cardinal that a damned Musketeer, named Athos, has taken her\nsafe-conduct from her by force; she will advise him in the same letter\nto get rid of his two friends, Aramis and Porthos, at the same time.\nThe cardinal will remember that these are the same men who have often\ncrossed his path; and then some fine morning he will arrest d'Artagnan,\nand for fear he should feel lonely, he will send us to keep him company\nin the Bastille.\"\n\n\"Go to! It appears to me you make dull jokes, my dear,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"I do not jest,\" said Athos.\n\n\"Do you know,\" said Porthos, \"that to twist that damned Milady's neck\nwould be a smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devils of\nHuguenots, who have committed no other crime than singing in French the\npsalms we sing in Latin?\"\n\n\"What says the abbe?\" asked Athos, quietly.\n\n\"I say I am entirely of Porthos's opinion,\" replied Aramis.\n\n\"And I, too,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Fortunately, she is far off,\" said Porthos, \"for I confess she would\nworry me if she were here.\"\n\n\"She worries me in England as well as in France,\" said Athos.\n\n\"She worries me everywhere,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"But when you held her in your power, why did you not drown her,\nstrangle her, hang her?\" said Porthos. \"It is only the dead who do not\nreturn.\"\n\n\"You think so, Porthos?\" replied the Musketeer, with a sad smile which\nd'Artagnan alone understood.\n\n\"I have an idea,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"What is it?\" said the Musketeers.\n\n\"To arms!\" cried Grimaud.\n\nThe young men sprang up, and seized their muskets.\n\nThis time a small troop advanced, consisting of from twenty to\ntwenty-five men; but they were not pioneers, they were soldiers of the\ngarrison.\n\n\"Shall we return to the camp?\" said Porthos. \"I don't think the sides\nare equal.\"\n\n\"Impossible, for three reasons,\" replied Athos. \"The first, that we\nhave not finished breakfast; the second, that we still have some very\nimportant things to say; and the third, that it yet wants ten minutes\nbefore the lapse of the hour.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Aramis, \"we must form a plan of battle.\"\n\n\"That's very simple,\" replied Athos. \"As soon as the enemy are within\nmusket shot, we must fire upon them. If they continue to advance, we\nmust fire again. We must fire as long as we have loaded guns. If those\nwho remain of the troop persist in coming to the assault, we will allow\nthe besiegers to get as far as the ditch, and then we will push down\nupon their heads that strip of wall which keeps its perpendicular by a\nmiracle.\"\n\n\"Bravo!\" cried Porthos. \"Decidedly, Athos, you were born to be a\ngeneral, and the cardinal, who fancies himself a great soldier, is\nnothing beside you.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Athos, \"no divided attention, I beg; let each one pick\nout his man.\"\n\n\"I cover mine,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"And I mine,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"And I mine,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Fire, then,\" said Athos.\n\nThe four muskets made but one report, but four men fell.\n\nThe drum immediately beat, and the little troop advanced at charging\npace.\n\nThen the shots were repeated without regularity, but always aimed\nwith the same accuracy. Nevertheless, as if they had been aware of the\nnumerical weakness of the friends, the Rochellais continued to advance\nin quick time.\n\nWith every three shots at least two men fell; but the march of those who\nremained was not slackened.\n\nArrived at the foot of the bastion, there were still more than a dozen\nof the enemy. A last discharge welcomed them, but did not stop them;\nthey jumped into the ditch, and prepared to scale the breach.\n\n\"Now, my friends,\" said Athos, \"finish them at a blow. To the wall; to\nthe wall!\"\n\nAnd the four friends, seconded by Grimaud, pushed with the barrels of\ntheir muskets an enormous sheet of the wall, which bent as if pushed by\nthe wind, and detaching itself from its base, fell with a horrible crash\ninto the ditch. Then a fearful crash was heard; a cloud of dust mounted\ntoward the sky--and all was over!\n\n\"Can we have destroyed them all, from the first to the last?\" said\nAthos.\n\n\"My faith, it appears so!\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"No,\" cried Porthos; \"there go three or four, limping away.\"\n\nIn fact, three or four of these unfortunate men, covered with dirt and\nblood, fled along the hollow way, and at length regained the city. These\nwere all who were left of the little troop.\n\nAthos looked at his watch.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"we have been here an hour, and our wager is won;\nbut we will be fair players. Besides, d'Artagnan has not told us his\nidea yet.\"\n\nAnd the Musketeer, with his usual coolness, reseated himself before the\nremains of the breakfast.\n\n\"My idea?\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes; you said you had an idea,\" said Athos.\n\n\"Oh, I remember,\" said d'Artagnan. \"Well, I will go to England a second\ntime; I will go and find Buckingham.\"\n\n\"You shall not do that, d'Artagnan,\" said Athos, coolly.\n\n\"And why not? Have I not been there once?\"\n\n\"Yes; but at that period we were not at war. At that period Buckingham\nwas an ally, and not an enemy. What you would now do amounts to\ntreason.\"\n\nD'Artagnan perceived the force of this reasoning, and was silent.\n\n\"But,\" said Porthos, \"I think I have an idea, in my turn.\"\n\n\"Silence for Monsieur Porthos's idea!\" said Aramis.\n\n\"I will ask leave of absence of Monsieur de Treville, on some pretext\nor other which you must invent; I am not very clever at pretexts. Milady\ndoes not know me; I will get access to her without her suspecting me,\nand when I catch my beauty, I will strangle her.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Athos, \"I am not far from approving the idea of Monsieur\nPorthos.\"\n\n\"For shame!\" said Aramis. \"Kill a woman? No, listen to me; I have the\ntrue idea.\"\n\n\"Let us see your idea, Aramis,\" said Athos, who felt much deference for\nthe young Musketeer.\n\n\"We must inform the queen.\"\n\n\"Ah, my faith, yes!\" said Porthos and d'Artagnan, at the same time; \"we\nare coming nearer to it now.\"\n\n\"Inform the queen!\" said Athos; \"and how? Have we relations with the\ncourt? Could we send anyone to Paris without its being known in the\ncamp? From here to Paris it is a hundred and forty leagues; before our\nletter was at Angers we should be in a dungeon.\"\n\n\"As to remitting a letter with safety to her Majesty,\" said Aramis,\ncoloring, \"I will take that upon myself. I know a clever person at\nTours--\"\n\nAramis stopped on seeing Athos smile.\n\n\"Well, do you not adopt this means, Athos?\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"I do not reject it altogether,\" said Athos; \"but I wish to remind\nAramis that he cannot quit the camp, and that nobody but one of\nourselves is trustworthy; that two hours after the messenger has set\nout, all the Capuchins, all the police, all the black caps of the\ncardinal, will know your letter by heart, and you and your clever person\nwill be arrested.\"\n\n\"Without reckoning,\" objected Porthos, \"that the queen would save\nMonsieur de Buckingham, but would take no heed of us.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said d'Artagnan, \"what Porthos says is full of sense.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah! but what's going on in the city yonder?\" said Athos.\n\n\"They are beating the general alarm.\"\n\nThe four friends listened, and the sound of the drum plainly reached\nthem.\n\n\"You see, they are going to send a whole regiment against us,\" said\nAthos.\n\n\"You don't think of holding out against a whole regiment, do you?\" said\nPorthos.\n\n\"Why not?\" said Musketeer. \"I feel myself quite in a humor for it; and I\nwould hold out before an army if we had taken the precaution to bring a\ndozen more bottles of wine.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, the drum draws near,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Let it come,\" said Athos. \"It is a quarter of an hour's journey from\nhere to the city, consequently a quarter of an hour's journey from the\ncity to hither. That is more than time enough for us to devise a plan.\nIf we go from this place we shall never find another so suitable. Ah,\nstop! I have it, gentlemen; the right idea has just occurred to me.\"\n\n\"Tell us.\"\n\n\"Allow me to give Grimaud some indispensable orders.\"\n\nAthos made a sign for his lackey to approach.\n\n\"Grimaud,\" said Athos, pointing to the bodies which lay under the wall\nof the bastion, \"take those gentlemen, set them up against the wall, put\ntheir hats upon their heads, and their guns in their hands.\"\n\n\"Oh, the great man!\" cried d'Artagnan. \"I comprehend now.\"\n\n\"You comprehend?\" said Porthos.\n\n\"And do you comprehend, Grimaud?\" said Aramis.\n\nGrimaud made a sign in the affirmative.\n\n\"That's all that is necessary,\" said Athos; \"now for my idea.\"\n\n\"I should like, however, to comprehend,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"That is useless.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes! Athos's idea!\" cried Aramis and d'Artagnan, at the same time.\n\n\"This Milady, this woman, this creature, this demon, has a\nbrother-in-law, as I think you told me, d'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know him very well; and I also believe that he has not a very\nwarm affection for his sister-in-law.\"\n\n\"There is no harm in that. If he detested her, it would be all the\nbetter,\" replied Athos.\n\n\"In that case we are as well off as we wish.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" said Porthos, \"I would like to know what Grimaud is about.\"\n\n\"Silence, Porthos!\" said Aramis.\n\n\"What is her brother-in-law's name?\"\n\n\"Lord de Winter.\"\n\n\"Where is he now?\"\n\n\"He returned to London at the first sound of war.\"\n\n\"Well, there's just the man we want,\" said Athos. \"It is he whom we must\nwarn. We will have him informed that his sister-in-law is on the point\nof having someone assassinated, and beg him not to lose sight of\nher. There is in London, I hope, some establishment like that of the\nMagdalens, or of the Repentant Daughters. He must place his sister in\none of these, and we shall be in peace.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said d'Artagnan, \"till she comes out.\"\n\n\"Ah, my faith!\" said Athos, \"you require too much, d'Artagnan. I have\ngiven you all I have, and I beg leave to tell you that this is the\nbottom of my sack.\"\n\n\"But I think it would be still better,\" said Aramis, \"to inform the\nqueen and Lord de Winter at the same time.\"\n\n\"Yes; but who is to carry the letter to Tours, and who to London?\"\n\n\"I answer for Bazin,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"And I for Planchet,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Ay,\" said Porthos, \"if we cannot leave the camp, our lackeys may.\"\n\n\"To be sure they may; and this very day we will write the letters,\" said\nAramis. \"Give the lackeys money, and they will start.\"\n\n\"We will give them money?\" replied Athos. \"Have you any money?\"\n\nThe four friends looked at one another, and a cloud came over the brows\nwhich but lately had been so cheerful.\n\n\"Look out!\" cried d'Artagnan, \"I see black points and red points moving\nyonder. Why did you talk of a regiment, Athos? It is a veritable army!\"\n\n\"My faith, yes,\" said Athos; \"there they are. See the sneaks come,\nwithout drum or trumpet. Ah, ah! have you finished, Grimaud?\"\n\nGrimaud made a sign in the affirmative, and pointed to a dozen bodies\nwhich he had set up in the most picturesque attitudes. Some carried\narms, others seemed to be taking aim, and the remainder appeared merely\nto be sword in hand.\n\n\"Bravo!\" said Athos; \"that does honor to your imagination.\"\n\n\"All very well,\" said Porthos, \"but I should like to understand.\"\n\n\"Let us decamp first, and you will understand afterward.\"\n\n\"A moment, gentlemen, a moment; give Grimaud time to clear away the\nbreakfast.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" said Aramis, \"the black points and the red points are visibly\nenlarging. I am of d'Artagnan's opinion; we have no time to lose in\nregaining our camp.\"\n\n\"My faith,\" said Athos, \"I have nothing to say against a retreat. We\nbet upon one hour, and we have stayed an hour and a half. Nothing can be\nsaid; let us be off, gentlemen, let us be off!\"\n\nGrimaud was already ahead, with the basket and the dessert. The four\nfriends followed, ten paces behind him.\n\n\"What the devil shall we do now, gentlemen?\" cried Athos.\n\n\"Have you forgotten anything?\" said Aramis.\n\n\"The white flag, morbleu! We must not leave a flag in the hands of the\nenemy, even if that flag be but a napkin.\"\n\nAnd Athos ran back to the bastion, mounted the platform, and bore off\nthe flag; but as the Rochellais had arrived within musket range, they\nopened a terrible fire upon this man, who appeared to expose himself for\npleasure's sake.\n\nBut Athos might be said to bear a charmed life. The balls passed and\nwhistled all around him; not one struck him.\n\nAthos waved his flag, turning his back on the guards of the city, and\nsaluting those of the camp. On both sides loud cries arose--on the one\nside cries of anger, on the other cries of enthusiasm.\n\nA second discharge followed the first, and three balls, by passing\nthrough it, made the napkin really a flag. Cries were heard from the\ncamp, \"Come down! come down!\"\n\nAthos came down; his friends, who anxiously awaited him, saw him\nreturned with joy.\n\n\"Come along, Athos, come along!\" cried d'Artagnan; \"now we have found\neverything except money, it would be stupid to be killed.\"\n\nBut Athos continued to march majestically, whatever remarks his\ncompanions made; and they, finding their remarks useless, regulated\ntheir pace by his.\n\nGrimaud and his basket were far in advance, out of the range of the\nballs.\n\nAt the end of an instant they heard a furious fusillade.\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Porthos, \"what are they firing at now? I hear no\nballs whistle, and I see nobody!\"\n\n\"They are firing at the corpses,\" replied Athos.\n\n\"But the dead cannot return their fire.\"\n\n\"Certainly not! They will then fancy it is an ambuscade, they will\ndeliberate; and by the time they have found out the pleasantry, we shall\nbe out of the range of their balls. That renders it useless to get a\npleurisy by too much haste.\"\n\n\"Oh, I comprehend now,\" said the astonished Porthos.\n\n\"That's lucky,\" said Athos, shrugging his shoulders.\n\nOn their part, the French, on seeing the four friends return at such a\nstep, uttered cries of enthusiasm.\n\nAt length a fresh discharge was heard, and this time the balls came\nrattling among the stones around the four friends, and whistling sharply\nin their ears. The Rochellais had at last taken possession of the\nbastion.\n\n\"These Rochellais are bungling fellows,\" said Athos; \"how many have we\nkilled of them--a dozen?\"\n\n\"Or fifteen.\"\n\n\"How many did we crush under the wall?\"\n\n\"Eight or ten.\"\n\n\"And in exchange for all that not even a scratch! Ah, but what is the\nmatter with your hand, d'Artagnan? It bleeds, seemingly.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's nothing,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"A spent ball?\"\n\n\"Not even that.\"\n\n\"What is it, then?\"\n\nWe have said that Athos loved d'Artagnan like a child, and this somber\nand inflexible personage felt the anxiety of a parent for the young man.\n\n\"Only grazed a little,\" replied d'Artagnan; \"my fingers were caught\nbetween two stones--that of the wall and that of my ring--and the skin\nwas broken.\"\n\n\"That comes of wearing diamonds, my master,\" said Athos, disdainfully.\n\n\"Ah, to be sure,\" cried Porthos, \"there is a diamond. Why the devil,\nthen, do we plague ourselves about money, when there is a diamond?\"\n\n\"Stop a bit!\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Well thought of, Porthos; this time you have an idea.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" said Porthos, drawing himself up at Athos's compliment;\n\"as there is a diamond, let us sell it.\"\n\n\"But,\" said d'Artagnan, \"it is the queen's diamond.\"\n\n\"The stronger reason why it should be sold,\" replied Athos. The queen\nsaving Monsieur de Buckingham, her lover; nothing more just. The queen\nsaving us, her friends; nothing more moral. Let us sell the diamond.\nWhat says Monsieur the Abbe? I don't ask Porthos; his opinion has been\ngiven.\"\n\n\"Why, I think,\" said Aramis, blushing as usual, \"that his ring not\ncoming from a mistress, and consequently not being a love token,\nd'Artagnan may sell it.\"\n\n\"My dear Aramis, you speak like theology personified. Your advice, then,\nis--\"\n\n\"To sell the diamond,\" replied Aramis.\n\n\"Well, then,\" said d'Artagnan, gaily, \"let us sell the diamond, and say\nno more about it.\"\n\nThe fusillade continued; but the four friends were out of reach, and the\nRochellais only fired to appease their consciences.\n\n\"My faith, it was time that idea came into Porthos's head. Here we are\nat the camp; therefore, gentlemen, not a word more of this affair.\nWe are observed; they are coming to meet us. We shall be carried in\ntriumph.\"\n\nIn fact, as we have said, the whole camp was in motion. More than two\nthousand persons had assisted, as at a spectacle, in this fortunate but\nwild undertaking of the four friends--an undertaking of which they were\nfar from suspecting the real motive. Nothing was heard but cries of\n\"Live the Musketeers! Live the Guards!\" M. de Busigny was the first to\ncome and shake Athos by the hand, and acknowledge that the wager was\nlost. The dragoon and the Swiss followed him, and all their comrades\nfollowed the dragoon and the Swiss. There was nothing but felicitations,\npressures of the hand, and embraces; there was no end to the\ninextinguishable laughter at the Rochellais. The tumult at length became\nso great that the cardinal fancied there must be some riot, and sent La\nHoudiniere, his captain of the Guards, to inquire what was going on.\n\nThe affair was described to the messenger with all the effervescence of\nenthusiasm.\n\n\"Well?\" asked the cardinal, on seeing La Houdiniere return.\n\n\"Well, monseigneur,\" replied the latter, \"three Musketeers and a\nGuardsman laid a wager with Monsieur de Busigny that they would go and\nbreakfast in the bastion St. Gervais; and while breakfasting they held\nit for two hours against the enemy, and have killed I don't know how\nmany Rochellais.\"\n\n\"Did you inquire the names of those three Musketeers?\"\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"What are their names?\"\n\n\"Messieurs Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.\"\n\n\"Still my three brave fellows!\" murmured the cardinal. \"And the\nGuardsman?\"\n\n\"d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Still my young scapegrace. Positively, these four men must be on my\nside.\"\n\nThe same evening the cardinal spoke to M. de Treville of the exploit of\nthe morning, which was the talk of the whole camp. M. de Treville, who\nhad received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the heroes\nof it, related it in all its details to his Eminence, not forgetting the\nepisode of the napkin.\n\n\"That's well, Monsieur de Treville,\" said the cardinal; \"pray let that\nnapkin be sent to me. I will have three fleur-de-lis embroidered on it\nin gold, and will give it to your company as a standard.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" said M. de Treville, \"that will be unjust to the\nGuardsmen. Monsieur d'Artagnan is not with me; he serves under Monsieur\nDessessart.\"\n\n\"Well, then, take him,\" said the cardinal; \"when four men are so much\nattached to one another, it is only fair that they should serve in the\nsame company.\"\n\nThat same evening M. de Treville announced this good news to the three\nMusketeers and d'Artagnan, inviting all four to breakfast with him next\nmorning.\n\nD'Artagnan was beside himself with joy. We know that the dream of his\nlife had been to become a Musketeer. The three friends were likewise\ngreatly delighted.\n\n\"My faith,\" said d'Artagnan to Athos, \"you had a triumphant idea! As\nyou said, we have acquired glory, and were enabled to carry on a\nconversation of the highest importance.\"\n\n\"Which we can resume now without anybody suspecting us, for, with the\nhelp of God, we shall henceforth pass for cardinalists.\"\n\nThat evening d'Artagnan went to present his respects to M. Dessessart,\nand inform him of his promotion.\n\nM. Dessessart, who esteemed d'Artagnan, made him offers of help, as this\nchange would entail expenses for equipment.\n\nD'Artagnan refused; but thinking the opportunity a good one, he begged\nhim to have the diamond he put into his hand valued, as he wished to\nturn it into money.\n\nThe next day, M. Dessessart's valet came to d'Artagnan's lodging, and\ngave him a bag containing seven thousand livres.\n\nThis was the price of the queen's diamond.\n\n\n\n\n48 A FAMILY AFFAIR\n\nAthos had invented the phrase, family affair. A family affair was not\nsubject to the investigation of the cardinal; a family affair concerned\nnobody. People might employ themselves in a family affair before all the\nworld. Therefore Athos had invented the phrase, family affair.\n\nAramis had discovered the idea, the lackeys.\n\nPorthos had discovered the means, the diamond.\n\nD'Artagnan alone had discovered nothing--he, ordinarily the most\ninventive of the four; but it must be also said that the very name of\nMilady paralyzed him.\n\nAh! no, we were mistaken; he had discovered a purchaser for his diamond.\n\nThe breakfast at M. de Treville's was as gay and cheerful as possible.\nD'Artagnan already wore his uniform--for being nearly of the same size\nas Aramis, and as Aramis was so liberally paid by the publisher who\npurchased his poem as to allow him to buy everything double, he sold his\nfriend a complete outfit.\n\nD'Artagnan would have been at the height of his wishes if he had not\nconstantly seen Milady like a dark cloud hovering in the horizon.\n\nAfter breakfast, it was agreed that they should meet again in the\nevening at Athos's lodging, and there finish their plans.\n\nD'Artagnan passed the day in exhibiting his Musketeer's uniform in every\nstreet of the camp.\n\nIn the evening, at the appointed hour, the four friends met. There only\nremained three things to decide--what they should write to Milady's\nbrother; what they should write to the clever person at Tours; and which\nshould be the lackeys to carry the letters.\n\nEveryone offered his own. Athos talked of the discretion of Grimaud,\nwho never spoke a word but when his master unlocked his mouth. Porthos\nboasted of the strength of Mousqueton, who was big enough to thrash four\nmen of ordinary size. Aramis, confiding in the address of Bazin, made a\npompous eulogium on his candidate. Finally, d'Artagnan had entire faith\nin the bravery of Planchet, and reminded them of the manner in which he\nhad conducted himself in the ticklish affair of Boulogne.\n\nThese four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time, and gave\nbirth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they\nshould be deemed too long.\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" said Athos, \"he whom we send must possess in himself\nalone the four qualities united.\"\n\n\"But where is such a lackey to be found?\"\n\n\"Not to be found!\" cried Athos. \"I know it well, so take Grimaud.\"\n\n\"Take Mousqueton.\"\n\n\"Take Bazin.\"\n\n\"Take Planchet. Planchet is brave and shrewd; they are two qualities out\nof the four.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Aramis, \"the principal question is not to know which\nof our four lackeys is the most discreet, the most strong, the most\nclever, or the most brave; the principal thing is to know which loves\nmoney the best.\"\n\n\"What Aramis says is very sensible,\" replied Athos; \"we must speculate\nupon the faults of people, and not upon their virtues. Monsieur Abbe,\nyou are a great moralist.\"\n\n\"Doubtless,\" said Aramis, \"for we not only require to be well served\nin order to succeed, but moreover, not to fail; for in case of failure,\nheads are in question, not for our lackeys--\"\n\n\"Speak lower, Aramis,\" said Athos.\n\n\"That's wise--not for the lackeys,\" resumed Aramis, \"but for the\nmaster--for the masters, we may say. Are our lackeys sufficiently\ndevoted to us to risk their lives for us? No.\"\n\n\"My faith,\" said d'Artagnan. \"I would almost answer for Planchet.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear friend, add to his natural devotedness a good sum of\nmoney, and then, instead of answering for him once, answer for him\ntwice.\"\n\n\"Why, good God! you will be deceived just the same,\" said Athos, who was\nan optimist when things were concerned, and a pessimist when men were in\nquestion. \"They will promise everything for the sake of the money, and\non the road fear will prevent them from acting. Once taken, they will be\npressed; when pressed, they will confess everything. What the devil!\nwe are not children. To reach England\"--Athos lowered his voice--\"all\nFrance, covered with spies and creatures of the cardinal, must be\ncrossed. A passport for embarkation must be obtained; and the party must\nbe acquainted with English in order to ask the way to London. Really, I\nthink the thing very difficult.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" cried d'Artagnan, who was anxious the matter should be\naccomplished; \"on the contrary, I think it very easy. It would be, no\ndoubt, parbleu, if we write to Lord de Winter about affairs of vast\nimportance, of the horrors of the cardinal--\"\n\n\"Speak lower!\" said Athos.\n\n\"--of intrigues and secrets of state,\" continued d'Artagnan, complying\nwith the recommendation. \"There can be no doubt we would all be broken\non the wheel; but for God's sake, do not forget, as you yourself said,\nAthos, that we only write to him concerning a family affair; that we\nonly write to him to entreat that as soon as Milady arrives in London\nhe will put it out of her power to injure us. I will write to him, then,\nnearly in these terms.\"\n\n\"Let us see,\" said Athos, assuming in advance a critical look.\n\n\"Monsieur and dear friend--\"\n\n\"Ah, yes! Dear friend to an Englishman,\" interrupted Athos; \"well\ncommenced! Bravo, d'Artagnan! Only with that word you would be quartered\ninstead of being broken on the wheel.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps. I will say, then, Monsieur, quite short.\"\n\n\"You may even say, My Lord,\" replied Athos, who stickled for propriety.\n\n\"My Lord, do you remember the little goat pasture of the Luxembourg?\"\n\n\"Good, the Luxembourg! One might believe this is an allusion to the\nqueen-mother! That's ingenious,\" said Athos.\n\n\"Well, then, we will put simply, My Lord, do you remember a certain\nlittle enclosure where your life was spared?\"\n\n\"My dear d'Artagnan, you will never make anything but a very bad\nsecretary. Where your life was spared! For shame! that's unworthy. A man\nof spirit is not to be reminded of such services. A benefit reproached\nis an offense committed.\"\n\n\"The devil!\" said d'Artagnan, \"you are insupportable. If the letter must\nbe written under your censure, my faith, I renounce the task.\"\n\n\"And you will do right. Handle the musket and the sword, my dear fellow.\nYou will come off splendidly at those two exercises; but pass the pen\nover to Monsieur Abbe. That's his province.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay!\" said Porthos; \"pass the pen to Aramis, who writes theses in\nLatin.\"\n\n\"Well, so be it,\" said d'Artagnan. \"Draw up this note for us, Aramis;\nbut by our Holy Father the Pope, cut it short, for I shall prune you in\nmy turn, I warn you.\"\n\n\"I ask no better,\" said Aramis, with that ingenious air of confidence\nwhich every poet has in himself; \"but let me be properly acquainted with\nthe subject. I have heard here and there that this sister-in-law was a\nhussy. I have obtained proof of it by listening to her conversation with\nthe cardinal.\"\n\n\"Lower! SACRE BLEU!\" said Athos.\n\n\"But,\" continued Aramis, \"the details escape me.\"\n\n\"And me also,\" said Porthos.\n\nD'Artagnan and Athos looked at each other for some time in silence.\nAt length Athos, after serious reflection and becoming more pale than\nusual, made a sign of assent to d'Artagnan, who by it understood he was\nat liberty to speak.\n\n\"Well, this is what you have to say,\" said d'Artagnan: \"My Lord, your\nsister-in-law is an infamous woman, who wished to have you killed that\nshe might inherit your wealth; but she could not marry your brother,\nbeing already married in France, and having been--\" d'Artagnan stopped,\nas if seeking for the word, and looked at Athos.\n\n\"Repudiated by her husband,\" said Athos.\n\n\"Because she had been branded,\" continued d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Bah!\" cried Porthos. \"Impossible! What do you say--that she wanted to\nhave her brother-in-law killed?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"She was married?\" asked Aramis.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And her husband found out that she had a fleur-de-lis on her shoulder?\"\ncried Porthos.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThese three yeses had been pronounced by Athos, each with a sadder\nintonation.\n\n\"And who has seen this fleur-de-lis?\" inquired Aramis.\n\n\"d'Artagnan and I. Or rather, to observe the chronological order, I and\nd'Artagnan,\" replied Athos.\n\n\"And does the husband of this frightful creature still live?\" said\nAramis.\n\n\"He still lives.\"\n\n\"Are you quite sure of it?\"\n\n\"I am he.\"\n\nThere was a moment of cold silence, during which everyone was affected\naccording to his nature.\n\n\"This time,\" said Athos, first breaking the silence, \"d'Artagnan has\ngiven us an excellent program, and the letter must be written at once.\"\n\n\"The devil! You are right, Athos,\" said Aramis; \"and it is a rather\ndifficult matter. The chancellor himself would be puzzled how to write\nsuch a letter, and yet the chancellor draws up an official report very\nreadily. Never mind! Be silent, I will write.\"\n\nAramis accordingly took the quill, reflected for a few moments, wrote\neight or ten lines in a charming little female hand, and then with a\nvoice soft and slow, as if each word had been scrupulously weighed, he\nread the following:\n\n\n\"My Lord, The person who writes these few lines had the honor of\ncrossing swords with you in the little enclosure of the Rue d'Enfer.\nAs you have several times since declared yourself the friend of that\nperson, he thinks it his duty to respond to that friendship by sending\nyou important information. Twice you have nearly been the victim of a\nnear relative, whom you believe to be your heir because you are ignorant\nthat before she contracted a marriage in England she was already married\nin France. But the third time, which is the present, you may succumb.\nYour relative left La Rochelle for England during the night. Watch her\narrival, for she has great and terrible projects. If you require to know\npositively what she is capable of, read her past history on her left\nshoulder.\"\n\n\n\"Well, now that will do wonderfully well,\" said Athos. \"My dear Aramis,\nyou have the pen of a secretary of state. Lord de Winter will now be\nupon his guard if the letter should reach him; and even if it should\nfall into the hands of the cardinal, we shall not be compromised. But\nas the lackey who goes may make us believe he has been to London and may\nstop at Chatellerault, let us give him only half the sum promised him,\nwith the letter, with an agreement that he shall have the other half in\nexchange for the reply. Have you the diamond?\" continued Athos.\n\n\"I have what is still better. I have the price;\" and d'Artagnan threw\nthe bag upon the table. At the sound of the gold Aramis raised his eyes\nand Porthos started. As to Athos, he remained unmoved.\n\n\"How much in that little bag?\"\n\n\"Seven thousand livres, in louis of twelve francs.\"\n\n\"Seven thousand livres!\" cried Porthos. \"That poor little diamond was\nworth seven thousand livres?\"\n\n\"It appears so,\" said Athos, \"since here they are. I don't suppose that\nour friend d'Artagnan has added any of his own to the amount.\"\n\n\"But, gentlemen, in all this,\" said d'Artagnan, \"we do not think of the\nqueen. Let us take some heed of the welfare of her dear Buckingham. That\nis the least we owe her.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said Athos; \"but that concerns Aramis.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied the latter, blushing, \"what must I say?\"\n\n\"Oh, that's simple enough!\" replied Athos. \"Write a second letter for\nthat clever personage who lives at Tours.\"\n\nAramis resumed his pen, reflected a little, and wrote the following\nlines, which he immediately submitted to the approbation of his friends.\n\n\"My dear cousin.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" said Athos. \"This clever person is your relative, then?\"\n\n\"Cousin-german.\"\n\n\"Go on, to your cousin, then!\"\n\nAramis continued:\n\n\n\"My dear Cousin, His Eminence, the cardinal, whom God preserve for the\nhappiness of France and the confusion of the enemies of the kingdom, is\non the point of putting an end to the hectic rebellion of La Rochelle.\nIt is probable that the succor of the English fleet will never even\narrive in sight of the place. I will even venture to say that I am\ncertain M. de Buckingham will be prevented from setting out by some\ngreat event. His Eminence is the most illustrious politician of\ntimes past, of times present, and probably of times to come. He would\nextinguish the sun if the sun incommoded him. Give these happy tidings\nto your sister, my dear cousin. I have dreamed that the unlucky\nEnglishman was dead. I cannot recollect whether it was by steel or by\npoison; only of this I am sure, I have dreamed he was dead, and you know\nmy dreams never deceive me. Be assured, then, of seeing me soon return.\"\n\n\n\"Capital!\" cried Athos; \"you are the king of poets, my dear Aramis. You\nspeak like the Apocalypse, and you are as true as the Gospel. There is\nnothing now to do but to put the address to this letter.\"\n\n\"That is easily done,\" said Aramis.\n\nHe folded the letter fancifully, and took up his pen and wrote:\n\n\n\"To Mlle. Michon, seamstress, Tours.\"\n\n\nThe three friends looked at one another and laughed; they were caught.\n\n\"Now,\" said Aramis, \"you will please to understand, gentlemen, that\nBazin alone can carry this letter to Tours. My cousin knows nobody but\nBazin, and places confidence in nobody but him; any other person would\nfail. Besides, Bazin is ambitious and learned; Bazin has read history,\ngentlemen, he knows that Sixtus the Fifth became Pope after having kept\npigs. Well, as he means to enter the Church at the same time as\nmyself, he does not despair of becoming Pope in his turn, or at least\na cardinal. You can understand that a man who has such views will never\nallow himself to be taken, or if taken, will undergo martyrdom rather\nthan speak.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said d'Artagnan, \"I consent to Bazin with all my heart,\nbut grant me Planchet. Milady had him one day turned out of doors, with\nsundry blows of a good stick to accelerate his motions. Now, Planchet\nhas an excellent memory; and I will be bound that sooner than relinquish\nany possible means of vengeance, he will allow himself to be beaten\nto death. If your arrangements at Tours are your arrangements, Aramis,\nthose of London are mine. I request, then, that Planchet may be chosen,\nmore particularly as he has already been to London with me, and knows\nhow to speak correctly: London, sir, if you please, and my master, Lord\nd'Artagnan. With that you may be satisfied he can make his way, both\ngoing and returning.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Athos, \"Planchet must receive seven hundred livres\nfor going, and seven hundred livres for coming back; and Bazin, three\nhundred livres for going, and three hundred livres for returning--that\nwill reduce the sum to five thousand livres. We will each take a\nthousand livres to be employed as seems good, and we will leave a fund\nof a thousand livres under the guardianship of Monsieur Abbe here, for\nextraordinary occasions or common wants. Will that do?\"\n\n\"My dear Athos,\" said Aramis, \"you speak like Nestor, who was, as\neveryone knows, the wisest among the Greeks.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Athos, \"it is agreed. Planchet and Bazin shall\ngo. Everything considered, I am not sorry to retain Grimaud; he is\naccustomed to my ways, and I am particular. Yesterday's affair must have\nshaken him a little; his voyage would upset him quite.\"\n\nPlanchet was sent for, and instructions were given him. The matter had\nbeen named to him by d'Artagnan, who in the first place pointed out the\nmoney to him, then the glory, and then the danger.\n\n\"I will carry the letter in the lining of my coat,\" said Planchet; \"and\nif I am taken I will swallow it.\"\n\n\"Well, but then you will not be able to fulfill your commission,\" said\nd'Artagnan.\n\n\"You will give me a copy this evening, which I shall know by heart\ntomorrow.\"\n\nD'Artagnan looked at his friends, as if to say, \"Well, what did I tell\nyou?\"\n\n\"Now,\" continued he, addressing Planchet, \"you have eight days to get\nan interview with Lord de Winter; you have eight days to return--in all\nsixteen days. If, on the sixteenth day after your departure, at eight\no'clock in the evening you are not here, no money--even if it be but\nfive minutes past eight.\"\n\n\"Then, monsieur,\" said Planchet, \"you must buy me a watch.\"\n\n\"Take this,\" said Athos, with his usual careless generosity, giving him\nhis own, \"and be a good lad. Remember, if you talk, if you babble, if\nyou get drunk, you risk your master's head, who has so much confidence\nin your fidelity, and who answers for you. But remember, also, that if\nby your fault any evil happens to d'Artagnan, I will find you, wherever\nyou may be, for the purpose of ripping up your belly.\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur!\" said Planchet, humiliated by the suspicion, and\nmoreover, terrified at the calm air of the Musketeer.\n\n\"And I,\" said Porthos, rolling his large eyes, \"remember, I will skin\nyou alive.\"\n\n\"Ah, monsieur!\"\n\n\"And I,\" said Aramis, with his soft, melodius voice, \"remember that I\nwill roast you at a slow fire, like a savage.\"\n\n\"Ah, monsieur!\"\n\nPlanchet began to weep. We will not venture to say whether it was from\nterror created by the threats or from tenderness at seeing four friends\nso closely united.\n\nD'Artagnan took his hand. \"See, Planchet,\" said he, \"these gentlemen\nonly say this out of affection for me, but at bottom they all like you.\"\n\n\"Ah, monsieur,\" said Planchet, \"I will succeed or I will consent to be\ncut in quarters; and if they do cut me in quarters, be assured that not\na morsel of me will speak.\"\n\nIt was decided that Planchet should set out the next day, at eight\no'clock in the morning, in order, as he had said, that he might during\nthe night learn the letter by heart. He gained just twelve hours by this\nengagement; he was to be back on the sixteenth day, by eight o'clock in\nthe evening.\n\nIn the morning, as he was mounting his horse, d'Artagnan, who felt at\nthe bottom of his heart a partiality for the duke, took Planchet aside.\n\n\"Listen,\" said he to him. \"When you have given the letter to Lord de\nWinter and he has read it, you will further say to him: Watch over\nhis Grace Lord Buckingham, for they wish to assassinate him. But this,\nPlanchet, is so serious and important that I have not informed my\nfriends that I would entrust this secret to you; and for a captain's\ncommission I would not write it.\"\n\n\"Be satisfied, monsieur,\" said Planchet, \"you shall see if confidence\ncan be placed in me.\"\n\nMounted on an excellent horse, which he was to leave at the end of\ntwenty leagues in order to take the post, Planchet set off at a gallop,\nhis spirits a little depressed by the triple promise made him by the\nMusketeers, but otherwise as light-hearted as possible.\n\nBazin set out the next day for Tours, and was allowed eight days for\nperforming his commission.\n\nThe four friends, during the period of these two absences, had, as may\nwell be supposed, the eye on the watch, the nose to the wind, and the\near on the hark. Their days were passed in endeavoring to catch all that\nwas said, in observing the proceeding of the cardinal, and in looking\nout for all the couriers who arrived. More than once an involuntary\ntrembling seized them when called upon for some unexpected service. They\nhad, besides, to look constantly to their own proper safety; Milady was\na phantom which, when it had once appeared to people, did not allow them\nto sleep very quietly.\n\nOn the morning of the eighth day, Bazin, fresh as ever, and smiling,\naccording to custom, entered the cabaret of the Parpaillot as the four\nfriends were sitting down to breakfast, saying, as had been agreed upon:\n\"Monsieur Aramis, the answer from your cousin.\"\n\nThe four friends exchanged a joyful glance; half of the work was done.\nIt is true, however, that it was the shorter and easier part.\n\nAramis, blushing in spite of himself, took the letter, which was in a\nlarge, coarse hand and not particular for its orthography.\n\n\"Good God!\" cried he, laughing, \"I quite despair of my poor Michon; she\nwill never write like Monsieur de Voiture.\"\n\n\"What does you mean by boor Michon?\" said the Swiss, who was chatting\nwith the four friends when the letter came.\n\n\"Oh, pardieu, less than nothing,\" said Aramis; \"a charming little\nseamstress, whom I love dearly and from whose hand I requested a few\nlines as a sort of keepsake.\"\n\n\"The duvil!\" said the Swiss, \"if she is as great a lady as her writing\nis large, you are a lucky fellow, gomrade!\"\n\nAramis read the letter, and passed it to Athos.\n\n\"See what she writes to me, Athos,\" said he.\n\nAthos cast a glance over the epistle, and to disperse all the suspicions\nthat might have been created, read aloud:\n\n\n\"My cousin, My sister and I are skillful in interpreting dreams, and\neven entertain great fear of them; but of yours it may be said, I hope,\nevery dream is an illusion. Adieu! Take care of yourself, and act so\nthat we may from time to time hear you spoken of.\n\n\"Marie Michon\"\n\n\n\"And what dream does she mean?\" asked the dragoon, who had approached\nduring the reading.\n\n\"Yez; what's the dream?\" said the Swiss.\n\n\"Well, pardieu!\" said Aramis, \"it was only this: I had a dream, and I\nrelated it to her.\"\n\n\"Yez, yez,\" said the Swiss; \"it's simple enough to dell a dream, but I\nneffer dream.\"\n\n\"You are very fortunate,\" said Athos, rising; \"I wish I could say as\nmuch!\"\n\n\"Neffer,\" replied the Swiss, enchanted that a man like Athos could envy\nhim anything. \"Neffer, neffer!\"\n\nD'Artagnan, seeing Athos rise, did likewise, took his arm, and went out.\n\nPorthos and Aramis remained behind to encounter the jokes of the dragoon\nand the Swiss.\n\nAs to Bazin, he went and lay down on a truss of straw; and as he had\nmore imagination than the Swiss, he dreamed that Aramis, having become\npope, adorned his head with a cardinal's hat.\n\nBut, as we have said, Bazin had not, by his fortunate return, removed\nmore than a part of the uneasiness which weighed upon the four friends.\nThe days of expectation are long, and d'Artagnan, in particular,\nwould have wagered that the days were forty-four hours. He forgot the\nnecessary slowness of navigation; he exaggerated to himself the power\nof Milady. He credited this woman, who appeared to him the equal of a\ndemon, with agents as supernatural as herself; at the least noise,\nhe imagined himself about to be arrested, and that Planchet was being\nbrought back to be confronted with himself and his friends. Still\nfurther, his confidence in the worthy Picard, at one time so great,\ndiminished day by day. This anxiety became so great that it even\nextended to Aramis and Porthos. Athos alone remained unmoved, as if no\ndanger hovered over him, and as if he breathed his customary atmosphere.\n\nOn the sixteenth day, in particular, these signs were so strong in\nd'Artagnan and his two friends that they could not remain quiet in one\nplace, and wandered about like ghosts on the road by which Planchet was\nexpected.\n\n\"Really,\" said Athos to them, \"you are not men but children, to let\na woman terrify you so! And what does it amount to, after all? To be\nimprisoned. Well, but we should be taken out of prison; Madame Bonacieux\nwas released. To be decapitated? Why, every day in the trenches we go\ncheerfully to expose ourselves to worse than that--for a bullet may\nbreak a leg, and I am convinced a surgeon would give us more pain in\ncutting off a thigh than an executioner in cutting off a head. Wait\nquietly, then; in two hours, in four, in six hours at latest, Planchet\nwill be here. He promised to be here, and I have very great faith in\nPlanchet, who appears to me to be a very good lad.\"\n\n\"But if he does not come?\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Well, if he does not come, it will be because he has been delayed,\nthat's all. He may have fallen from his horse, he may have cut a caper\nfrom the deck; he may have traveled so fast against the wind as to\nhave brought on a violent catarrh. Eh, gentlemen, let us reckon upon\naccidents! Life is a chaplet of little miseries which the philosopher\ncounts with a smile. Be philosophers, as I am, gentlemen; sit down at\nthe table and let us drink. Nothing makes the future look so bright as\nsurveying it through a glass of chambertin.\"\n\n\"That's all very well,\" replied d'Artagnan; \"but I am tired of fearing\nwhen I open a fresh bottle that the wine may come from the cellar of\nMilady.\"\n\n\"You are very fastidious,\" said Athos; \"such a beautiful woman!\"\n\n\"A woman of mark!\" said Porthos, with his loud laugh.\n\nAthos started, passed his hand over his brow to remove the drops of\nperspiration that burst forth, and rose in his turn with a nervous\nmovement he could not repress.\n\nThe day, however, passed away; and the evening came on slowly, but\nfinally it came. The bars were filled with drinkers. Athos, who had\npocketed his share of the diamond, seldom quit the Parpaillot. He had\nfound in M. de Busigny, who, by the by, had given them a magnificent\ndinner, a partner worthy of his company. They were playing together,\nas usual, when seven o'clock sounded; the patrol was heard passing to\ndouble the posts. At half past seven the retreat was sounded.\n\n\"We are lost,\" said d'Artagnan, in the ear of Athos.\n\n\"You mean to say we have lost,\" said Athos, quietly, drawing four\npistoles from his pocket and throwing them upon the table. \"Come,\ngentlemen,\" said he, \"they are beating the tattoo. Let us to bed!\"\n\nAnd Athos went out of the Parpaillot, followed by d'Artagnan. Aramis\ncame behind, giving his arm to Porthos. Aramis mumbled verses to\nhimself, and Porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his\nmustache, in sign of despair.\n\nBut all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which\nwas familiar to d'Artagnan, and a well-known voice said, \"Monsieur, I\nhave brought your cloak; it is chilly this evening.\"\n\n\"Planchet!\" cried d'Artagnan, beside himself with joy.\n\n\"Planchet!\" repeated Aramis and Porthos.\n\n\"Well, yes, Planchet, to be sure,\" said Athos, \"what is there so\nastonishing in that? He promised to be back by eight o'clock, and eight\nis striking. Bravo, Planchet, you are a lad of your word, and if ever\nyou leave your master, I will promise you a place in my service.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, never,\" said Planchet, \"I will never leave Monsieur\nd'Artagnan.\"\n\nAt the same time d'Artagnan felt that Planchet slipped a note into his\nhand.\n\nD'Artagnan felt a strong inclination to embrace Planchet as he\nhad embraced him on his departure; but he feared lest this mark of\naffection, bestowed upon his lackey in the open street, might appear\nextraordinary to passers-by, and he restrained himself.\n\n\"I have the note,\" said he to Athos and to his friends.\n\n\"That's well,\" said Athos, \"let us go home and read it.\"\n\nThe note burned the hand of d'Artagnan. He wished to hasten their steps;\nbut Athos took his arm and passed it under his own, and the young man\nwas forced to regulate his pace by that of his friend.\n\nAt length they reached the tent, lit a lamp, and while Planchet stood at\nthe entrance that the four friends might not be surprised, d'Artagnan,\nwith a trembling hand, broke the seal and opened the so anxiously\nexpected letter.\n\nIt contained half a line, in a hand perfectly British, and with a\nconciseness as perfectly Spartan:\n\n\nThank you; be easy.\n\n\nd'Artagnan translated this for the others.\n\nAthos took the letter from the hands of d'Artagnan, approached the\nlamp, set fire to the paper, and did not let go till it was reduced to a\ncinder.\n\nThen, calling Planchet, he said, \"Now, my lad, you may claim your seven\nhundred livres, but you did not run much risk with such a note as that.\"\n\n\"I am not to blame for having tried every means to compress it,\" said\nPlanchet.\n\n\"Well!\" cried d'Artagnan, \"tell us all about it.\"\n\n\"Dame, that's a long job, monsieur.\"\n\n\"You are right, Planchet,\" said Athos; \"besides, the tattoo has been\nsounded, and we should be observed if we kept a light burning much\nlonger than the others.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" said d'Artagnan. \"Go to bed, Planchet, and sleep soundly.\"\n\n\"My faith, monsieur! that will be the first time I have done so for\nsixteen days.\"\n\n\"And me, too!\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"And me, too!\" said Porthos.\n\n\"And me, too!\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Well, if you will have the truth, and me, too!\" said Athos.\n\n\n\n\n49 FATALITY\n\nMeantime Milady, drunk with passion, roaring on the deck like a lioness\nthat has been embarked, had been tempted to throw herself into the\nsea that she might regain the coast, for she could not get rid of the\nthought that she had been insulted by d'Artagnan, threatened by Athos,\nand that she had quit France without being revenged on them. This\nidea soon became so insupportable to her that at the risk of whatever\nterrible consequences might result to herself from it, she implored the\ncaptain to put her on shore; but the captain, eager to escape from his\nfalse position--placed between French and English cruisers, like the bat\nbetween the mice and the birds--was in great haste to regain England,\nand positively refused to obey what he took for a woman's caprice,\npromising his passenger, who had been particularly recommended to him by\nthe cardinal, to land her, if the sea and the French permitted him, at\none of the ports of Brittany, either at Lorient or Brest. But the wind\nwas contrary, the sea bad; they tacked and kept offshore. Nine days\nafter leaving the Charente, pale with fatigue and vexation, Milady saw\nonly the blue coasts of Finisterre appear.\n\nShe calculated that to cross this corner of France and return to the\ncardinal it would take her at least three days. Add another day for\nlanding, and that would make four. Add these four to the nine others,\nthat would be thirteen days lost--thirteen days, during which so many\nimportant events might pass in London. She reflected likewise that the\ncardinal would be furious at her return, and consequently would be more\ndisposed to listen to the complaints brought against her than to the\naccusations she brought against others.\n\nShe allowed the vessel to pass Lorient and Brest without repeating her\nrequest to the captain, who, on his part, took care not to remind her\nof it. Milady therefore continued her voyage, and on the very day\nthat Planchet embarked at Portsmouth for France, the messenger of his\nEminence entered the port in triumph.\n\nAll the city was agitated by an extraordinary movement. Four large\nvessels, recently built, had just been launched. At the end of the\njetty, his clothes richly laced with gold, glittering, as was customary\nwith him, with diamonds and precious stones, his hat ornamented with\na white feather which drooped upon his shoulder, Buckingham was seen\nsurrounded by a staff almost as brilliant as himself.\n\nIt was one of those rare and beautiful days in winter when England\nremembers that there is a sun. The star of day, pale but nevertheless\nstill splendid, was setting in the horizon, glorifying at once the\nheavens and the sea with bands of fire, and casting upon the towers and\nthe old houses of the city a last ray of gold which made the windows\nsparkle like the reflection of a conflagration. Breathing that\nsea breeze, so much more invigorating and balsamic as the land is\napproached, contemplating all the power of those preparations she was\ncommissioned to destroy, all the power of that army which she was to\ncombat alone--she, a woman with a few bags of gold--Milady compared\nherself mentally to Judith, the terrible Jewess, when she penetrated the\ncamp of the Assyrians and beheld the enormous mass of chariots, horses,\nmen, and arms, which a gesture of her hand was to dissipate like a cloud\nof smoke.\n\nThey entered the roadstead; but as they drew near in order to cast\nanchor, a little cutter, looking like a coastguard formidably armed,\napproached the merchant vessel and dropped into the sea a boat which\ndirected its course to the ladder. This boat contained an officer, a\nmate, and eight rowers. The officer alone went on board, where he was\nreceived with all the deference inspired by the uniform.\n\nThe officer conversed a few instants with the captain, gave him several\npapers, of which he was the bearer, to read, and upon the order of\nthe merchant captain the whole crew of the vessel, both passengers and\nsailors, were called upon deck.\n\nWhen this species of summons was made the officer inquired aloud the\npoint of the brig's departure, its route, its landings; and to all these\nquestions the captain replied without difficulty and without hesitation.\nThen the officer began to pass in review all the people, one after the\nother, and stopping when he came to Milady, surveyed her very closely,\nbut without addressing a single word to her.\n\nHe then returned to the captain, said a few words to him, and as if\nfrom that moment the vessel was under his command, he ordered a maneuver\nwhich the crew executed immediately. Then the vessel resumed its course,\nstill escorted by the little cutter, which sailed side by side with it,\nmenacing it with the mouths of its six cannon. The boat followed in the\nwake of the ship, a speck near the enormous mass.\n\nDuring the examination of Milady by the officer, as may well be\nimagined, Milady on her part was not less scrutinizing in her glances.\nBut however great was the power of this woman with eyes of flame in\nreading the hearts of those whose secrets she wished to divine, she\nmet this time with a countenance of such impassivity that no discovery\nfollowed her investigation. The officer who had stopped in front of\nher and studied her with so much care might have been twenty-five or\ntwenty-six years of age. He was of pale complexion, with clear blue\neyes, rather deeply set; his mouth, fine and well cut, remained\nmotionless in its correct lines; his chin, strongly marked, denoted that\nstrength of will which in the ordinary Britannic type denotes mostly\nnothing but obstinacy; a brow a little receding, as is proper for poets,\nenthusiasts, and soldiers, was scarcely shaded by short thin hair\nwhich, like the beard which covered the lower part of his face, was of a\nbeautiful deep chestnut color.\n\nWhen they entered the port, it was already night. The fog increased the\ndarkness, and formed round the sternlights and lanterns of the jetty a\ncircle like that which surrounds the moon when the weather threatens to\nbecome rainy. The air they breathed was heavy, damp, and cold.\n\nMilady, that woman so courageous and firm, shivered in spite of herself.\n\nThe officer desired to have Milady's packages pointed out to him, and\nordered them to be placed in the boat. When this operation was complete,\nhe invited her to descend by offering her his hand.\n\nMilady looked at this man, and hesitated. \"Who are you, sir,\" asked\nshe, \"who has the kindness to trouble yourself so particularly on my\naccount?\"\n\n\"You may perceive, madame, by my uniform, that I am an officer in the\nEnglish navy,\" replied the young man.\n\n\"But is it the custom for the officers in the English navy to place\nthemselves at the service of their female compatriots when they land in\na port of Great Britain, and carry their gallantry so far as to conduct\nthem ashore?\"\n\n\"Yes, madame, it is the custom, not from gallantry but prudence, that\nin time of war foreigners should be conducted to particular hotels, in\norder that they may remain under the eye of the government until full\ninformation can be obtained about them.\"\n\nThese words were pronounced with the most exact politeness and the most\nperfect calmness. Nevertheless, they had not the power of convincing\nMilady.\n\n\"But I am not a foreigner, sir,\" said she, with an accent as pure as\never was heard between Portsmouth and Manchester; \"my name is Lady\nClarik, and this measure--\"\n\n\"This measure is general, madame; and you will seek in vain to evade\nit.\"\n\n\"I will follow you, then, sir.\"\n\nAccepting the hand of the officer, she began the descent of the ladder,\nat the foot of which the boat waited. The officer followed her. A large\ncloak was spread at the stern; the officer requested her to sit down\nupon this cloak, and placed himself beside her.\n\n\"Row!\" said he to the sailors.\n\nThe eight oars fell at once into the sea, making but a single sound,\ngiving but a single stroke, and the boat seemed to fly over the surface\nof the water.\n\nIn five minutes they gained the land.\n\nThe officer leaped to the pier, and offered his hand to Milady. A\ncarriage was in waiting.\n\n\"Is this carriage for us?\" asked Milady.\n\n\"Yes, madame,\" replied the officer.\n\n\"The hotel, then, is far away?\"\n\n\"At the other end of the town.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Milady; and she resolutely entered the carriage.\n\nThe officer saw that the baggage was fastened carefully behind the\ncarriage; and this operation ended, he took his place beside Milady, and\nshut the door.\n\nImmediately, without any order being given or his place of destination\nindicated, the coachman set off at a rapid pace, and plunged into the\nstreets of the city.\n\nSo strange a reception naturally gave Milady ample matter for\nreflection; so seeing that the young officer did not seem at all\ndisposed for conversation, she reclined in her corner of the carriage,\nand one after the other passed in review all the surmises which\npresented themselves to her mind.\n\nAt the end of a quarter of an hour, however, surprised at the length of\nthe journey, she leaned forward toward the door to see whither she was\nbeing conducted. Houses were no longer to be seen; trees appeared in\nthe darkness like great black phantoms chasing one another. Milady\nshuddered.\n\n\"But we are no longer in the city, sir,\" said she.\n\nThe young officer preserved silence.\n\n\"I beg you to understand, sir, I will go no farther unless you tell me\nwhither you are taking me.\"\n\nThis threat brought no reply.\n\n\"Oh, this is too much,\" cried Milady. \"Help! help!\"\n\nNo voice replied to hers; the carriage continued to roll on with\nrapidity; the officer seemed a statue.\n\nMilady looked at the officer with one of those terrible expressions\npeculiar to her countenance, and which so rarely failed of their effect;\nanger made her eyes flash in the darkness.\n\nThe young man remained immovable.\n\nMilady tried to open the door in order to throw herself out.\n\n\"Take care, madame,\" said the young man, coolly, \"you will kill yourself\nin jumping.\"\n\nMilady reseated herself, foaming. The officer leaned forward, looked at\nher in his turn, and appeared surprised to see that face, just before\nso beautiful, distorted with passion and almost hideous. The artful\ncreature at once comprehended that she was injuring herself by allowing\nhim thus to read her soul; she collected her features, and in a\ncomplaining voice said: \"In the name of heaven, sir, tell me if it is to\nyou, if it is to your government, if it is to an enemy I am to attribute\nthe violence that is done me?\"\n\n\"No violence will be offered to you, madame, and what happens to you is\nthe result of a very simple measure which we are obliged to adopt with\nall who land in England.\"\n\n\"Then you don't know me, sir?\"\n\n\"It is the first time I have had the honor of seeing you.\"\n\n\"And on your honor, you have no cause of hatred against me?\"\n\n\"None, I swear to you.\"\n\nThere was so much serenity, coolness, mildness even, in the voice of the\nyoung man, that Milady felt reassured.\n\nAt length after a journey of nearly an hour, the carriage stopped before\nan iron gate, which closed an avenue leading to a castle severe in form,\nmassive, and isolated. Then, as the wheels rolled over a fine gravel,\nMilady could hear a vast roaring, which she at once recognized as the\nnoise of the sea dashing against some steep cliff.\n\nThe carriage passed under two arched gateways, and at length stopped\nin a court large, dark, and square. Almost immediately the door of the\ncarriage was opened, the young man sprang lightly out and presented\nhis hand to Milady, who leaned upon it, and in her turn alighted with\ntolerable calmness.\n\n\"Still, then, I am a prisoner,\" said Milady, looking around her, and\nbringing back her eyes with a most gracious smile to the young officer;\n\"but I feel assured it will not be for long,\" added she. \"My own\nconscience and your politeness, sir, are the guarantees of that.\"\n\nHowever flattering this compliment, the officer made no reply; but\ndrawing from his belt a little silver whistle, such as boatswains use in\nships of war, he whistled three times, with three different modulations.\nImmediately several men appeared, who unharnessed the smoking horses,\nand put the carriage into a coach house.\n\nThen the officer, with the same calm politeness, invited his prisoner\nto enter the house. She, with a still-smiling countenance, took his arm,\nand passed with him under a low arched door, which by a vaulted passage,\nlighted only at the farther end, led to a stone staircase around an\nangle of stone. They then came to a massive door, which after the\nintroduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried with\nhim, turned heavily upon its hinges, and disclosed the chamber destined\nfor Milady.\n\nWith a single glance the prisoner took in the apartment in its minutest\ndetails. It was a chamber whose furniture was at once appropriate for a\nprisoner or a free man; and yet bars at the windows and outside bolts at\nthe door decided the question in favor of the prison.\n\nIn an instant all the strength of mind of this creature, though drawn\nfrom the most vigorous sources, abandoned her; she sank into a large\neasy chair, with her arms crossed, her head lowered, and expecting every\ninstant to see a judge enter to interrogate her.\n\nBut no one entered except two or three marines, who brought her trunks\nand packages, deposited them in a corner, and retired without speaking.\n\nThe officer superintended all these details with the same calmness\nMilady had constantly seen in him, never pronouncing a word himself,\nand making himself obeyed by a gesture of his hand or a sound of his\nwhistle.\n\nIt might have been said that between this man and his inferiors spoken\nlanguage did not exist, or had become useless.\n\nAt length Milady could hold out no longer; she broke the silence. \"In\nthe name of heaven, sir,\" cried she, \"what means all that is passing?\nPut an end to my doubts; I have courage enough for any danger I can\nforesee, for every misfortune which I understand. Where am I, and why\nam I here? If I am free, why these bars and these doors? If I am a\nprisoner, what crime have I committed?\"\n\n\"You are here in the apartment destined for you, madame. I received\norders to go and take charge of you on the sea, and to conduct you\nto this castle. This order I believe I have accomplished with all the\nexactness of a soldier, but also with the courtesy of a gentleman. There\nterminates, at least to the present moment, the duty I had to fulfill\ntoward you; the rest concerns another person.\"\n\n\"And who is that other person?\" asked Milady, warmly. \"Can you not tell\nme his name?\"\n\nAt the moment a great jingling of spurs was heard on the stairs.\nSome voices passed and faded away, and the sound of a single footstep\napproached the door.\n\n\"That person is here, madame,\" said the officer, leaving the entrance\nopen, and drawing himself up in an attitude of respect.\n\nAt the same time the door opened; a man appeared on the threshold. He\nwas without a hat, carried a sword, and flourished a handkerchief in his\nhand.\n\nMilady thought she recognized this shadow in the gloom; she supported\nherself with one hand upon the arm of the chair, and advanced her head\nas if to meet a certainty.\n\nThe stranger advanced slowly, and as he advanced, after entering into\nthe circle of light projected by the lamp, Milady involuntarily drew\nback.\n\nThen when she had no longer any doubt, she cried, in a state of stupor,\n\"What, my brother, is it you?\"\n\n\"Yes, fair lady!\" replied Lord de Winter, making a bow, half courteous,\nhalf ironical; \"it is I, myself.\"\n\n\"But this castle, then?\"\n\n\"Is mine.\"\n\n\"This chamber?\"\n\n\"Is yours.\"\n\n\"I am, then, your prisoner?\"\n\n\"Nearly so.\"\n\n\"But this is a frightful abuse of power!\"\n\n\"No high-sounding words! Let us sit down and chat quietly, as brother\nand sister ought to do.\"\n\nThen, turning toward the door, and seeing that the young officer was\nwaiting for his last orders, he said. \"All is well, I thank you; now\nleave us alone, Mr. Felton.\"\n\n\n\n\n50 CHAT BETWEEN BROTHER AND SISTER\n\nDuring the time which Lord de Winter took to shut the door, close a\nshutter, and draw a chair near to his sister-in-law's fauteuil, Milady,\nanxiously thoughtful, plunged her glance into the depths of possibility,\nand discovered all the plan, of which she could not even obtain a glance\nas long as she was ignorant into whose hands she had fallen. She knew\nher brother-in-law to be a worthy gentleman, a bold hunter, an intrepid\nplayer, enterprising with women, but by no means remarkable for his\nskill in intrigues. How had he discovered her arrival, and caused her to\nbe seized? Why did he detain her?\n\nAthos had dropped some words which proved that the conversation she\nhad with the cardinal had fallen into outside ears; but she could not\nsuppose that he had dug a countermine so promptly and so boldly. She\nrather feared that her preceding operations in England might have been\ndiscovered. Buckingham might have guessed that it was she who had cut\noff the two studs, and avenge himself for that little treachery;\nbut Buckingham was incapable of going to any excess against a woman,\nparticularly if that woman was supposed to have acted from a feeling of\njealousy.\n\nThis supposition appeared to her most reasonable. It seemed to her that\nthey wanted to revenge the past, and not to anticipate the future. At\nall events, she congratulated herself upon having fallen into the\nhands of her brother-in-law, with whom she reckoned she could deal very\neasily, rather than into the hands of an acknowledged and intelligent\nenemy.\n\n\"Yes, let us chat, brother,\" said she, with a kind of cheerfulness,\ndecided as she was to draw from the conversation, in spite of all the\ndissimulation Lord de Winter could bring, the revelations of which she\nstood in need to regulate her future conduct.\n\n\"You have, then, decided to come to England again,\" said Lord de Winter,\n\"in spite of the resolutions you so often expressed in Paris never to\nset your feet on British ground?\"\n\nMilady replied to this question by another question. \"To begin with,\ntell me,\" said she, \"how have you watched me so closely as to be aware\nbeforehand not only of my arrival, but even of the day, the hour, and\nthe port at which I should arrive?\"\n\nLord de Winter adopted the same tactics as Milady, thinking that as his\nsister-in-law employed them they must be the best.\n\n\"But tell me, my dear sister,\" replied he, \"what makes you come to\nEngland?\"\n\n\"I come to see you,\" replied Milady, without knowing how much she\naggravated by this reply the suspicions to which d'Artagnan's letter had\ngiven birth in the mind of her brother-in-law, and only desiring to gain\nthe good will of her auditor by a falsehood.\n\n\"Ah, to see me?\" said de Winter, cunningly.\n\n\"To be sure, to see you. What is there astonishing in that?\"\n\n\"And you had no other object in coming to England but to see me?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"So it was for me alone you have taken the trouble to cross the\nChannel?\"\n\n\"For you alone.\"\n\n\"The deuce! What tenderness, my sister!\"\n\n\"But am I not your nearest relative?\" demanded Milady, with a tone of\nthe most touching ingenuousness.\n\n\"And my only heir, are you not?\" said Lord de Winter in his turn, fixing\nhis eyes on those of Milady.\n\nWhatever command she had over herself, Milady could not help starting;\nand as in pronouncing the last words Lord de Winter placed his hand upon\nthe arm of his sister, this start did not escape him.\n\nIn fact, the blow was direct and severe. The first idea that occurred to\nMilady's mind was that she had been betrayed by Kitty, and that she had\nrecounted to the baron the selfish aversion toward himself of which she\nhad imprudently allowed some marks to escape before her servant. She\nalso recollected the furious and imprudent attack she had made upon\nd'Artagnan when he spared the life of her brother.\n\n\"I do not understand, my Lord,\" said she, in order to gain time and make\nher adversary speak out. \"What do you mean to say? Is there any secret\nmeaning concealed beneath your words?\"\n\n\"Oh, my God, no!\" said Lord de Winter, with apparent good nature. \"You\nwish to see me, and you come to England. I learn this desire, or rather\nI suspect that you feel it; and in order to spare you all the annoyances\nof a nocturnal arrival in a port and all the fatigues of landing, I send\none of my officers to meet you, I place a carriage at his orders, and he\nbrings you hither to this castle, of which I am governor, whither I come\nevery day, and where, in order to satisfy our mutual desire of\nseeing each other, I have prepared you a chamber. What is there more\nastonishing in all that I have said to you than in what you have told\nme?\"\n\n\"No; what I think astonishing is that you should expect my coming.\"\n\n\"And yet that is the most simple thing in the world, my dear sister.\nHave you not observed that the captain of your little vessel, on\nentering the roadstead, sent forward, in order to obtain permission to\nenter the port, a little boat bearing his logbook and the register of\nhis voyagers? I am commandant of the port. They brought me that book.\nI recognized your name in it. My heart told me what your mouth has just\nconfirmed--that is to say, with what view you have exposed yourself to\nthe dangers of a sea so perilous, or at least so troublesome at this\nmoment--and I sent my cutter to meet you. You know the rest.\"\n\nMilady knew that Lord de Winter lied, and she was the more alarmed.\n\n\"My brother,\" continued she, \"was not that my Lord Buckingham whom I saw\non the jetty this evening as we arrived?\"\n\n\"Himself. Ah, I can understand how the sight of him struck you,\" replied\nLord de Winter. \"You came from a country where he must be very much\ntalked of, and I know that his armaments against France greatly engage\nthe attention of your friend the cardinal.\"\n\n\"My friend the cardinal!\" cried Milady, seeing that on this point as on\nthe other Lord de Winter seemed well instructed.\n\n\"Is he not your friend?\" replied the baron, negligently. \"Ah, pardon!\nI thought so; but we will return to my Lord Duke presently. Let us not\ndepart from the sentimental turn our conversation had taken. You came,\nyou say, to see me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, I reply that you shall be served to the height of your wishes,\nand that we shall see each other every day.\"\n\n\"Am I, then, to remain here eternally?\" demanded Milady, with a certain\nterror.\n\n\"Do you find yourself badly lodged, sister? Demand anything you want,\nand I will hasten to have you furnished with it.\"\n\n\"But I have neither my women nor my servants.\"\n\n\"You shall have all, madame. Tell me on what footing your household\nwas established by your first husband, and although I am only your\nbrother-in-law, I will arrange one similar.\"\n\n\"My first husband!\" cried Milady, looking at Lord de Winter with eyes\nalmost starting from their sockets.\n\n\"Yes, your French husband. I don't speak of my brother. If you have\nforgotten, as he is still living, I can write to him and he will send me\ninformation on the subject.\"\n\nA cold sweat burst from the brow of Milady.\n\n\"You jest!\" said she, in a hollow voice.\n\n\"Do I look so?\" asked the baron, rising and going a step backward.\n\n\"Or rather you insult me,\" continued she, pressing with her stiffened\nhands the two arms of her easy chair, and raising herself upon her\nwrists.\n\n\"I insult you!\" said Lord de Winter, with contempt. \"In truth, madame,\ndo you think that can be possible?\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir,\" said Milady, \"you must be either drunk or mad. Leave the\nroom, and send me a woman.\"\n\n\"Women are very indiscreet, my sister. Cannot I serve you as a waiting\nmaid? By that means all our secrets will remain in the family.\"\n\n\"Insolent!\" cried Milady; and as if acted upon by a spring, she bounded\ntoward the baron, who awaited her attack with his arms crossed, but\nnevertheless with one hand on the hilt of his sword.\n\n\"Come!\" said he. \"I know you are accustomed to assassinate people; but I\nwarn you I shall defend myself, even against you.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said Milady. \"You have all the appearance of being\ncowardly enough to lift your hand against a woman.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so; and I have an excuse, for mine would not be the first hand\nof a man that has been placed upon you, I imagine.\"\n\nAnd the baron pointed, with a slow and accusing gesture, to the left\nshoulder of Milady, which he almost touched with his finger.\n\nMilady uttered a deep, inward shriek, and retreated to a corner of the\nroom like a panther which crouches for a spring.\n\n\"Oh, growl as much as you please,\" cried Lord de Winter, \"but don't try\nto bite, for I warn you that it would be to your disadvantage. There\nare here no procurators who regulate successions beforehand. There is no\nknight-errant to come and seek a quarrel with me on account of the fair\nlady I detain a prisoner; but I have judges quite ready who will quickly\ndispose of a woman so shameless as to glide, a bigamist, into the bed of\nLord de Winter, my brother. And these judges, I warn you, will soon send\nyou to an executioner who will make both your shoulders alike.\"\n\nThe eyes of Milady darted such flashes that although he was a man and\narmed before an unarmed woman, he felt the chill of fear glide through\nhis whole frame. However, he continued all the same, but with increasing\nwarmth: \"Yes, I can very well understand that after having inherited the\nfortune of my brother it would be very agreeable to you to be my heir\nlikewise; but know beforehand, if you kill me or cause me to be killed,\nmy precautions are taken. Not a penny of what I possess will pass into\nyour hands. Were you not already rich enough--you who possess nearly\na million? And could you not stop your fatal career, if you did not do\nevil for the infinite and supreme joy of doing it? Oh, be assured, if\nthe memory of my brother were not sacred to me, you should rot in a\nstate dungeon or satisfy the curiosity of sailors at Tyburn. I will be\nsilent, but you must endure your captivity quietly. In fifteen or twenty\ndays I shall set out for La Rochelle with the army; but on the eve of\nmy departure a vessel which I shall see depart will take you hence and\nconvey you to our colonies in the south. And be assured that you shall\nbe accompanied by one who will blow your brains out at the first attempt\nyou make to return to England or the Continent.\"\n\nMilady listened with an attention that dilated her inflamed eyes.\n\n\"Yes, at present,\" continued Lord de Winter, \"you will remain in this\ncastle. The walls are thick, the doors strong, and the bars solid;\nbesides, your window opens immediately over the sea. The men of my\ncrew, who are devoted to me for life and death, mount guard around this\napartment, and watch all the passages that lead to the courtyard. Even\nif you gained the yard, there would still be three iron gates for you\nto pass. The order is positive. A step, a gesture, a word, on your part,\ndenoting an effort to escape, and you are to be fired upon. If they kill\nyou, English justice will be under an obligation to me for having\nsaved it trouble. Ah! I see your features regain their calmness, your\ncountenance recovers its assurance. You are saying to yourself: 'Fifteen\ndays, twenty days? Bah! I have an inventive mind; before that is expired\nsome idea will occur to me. I have an infernal spirit. I shall meet with\na victim. Before fifteen days are gone by I shall be away from here.'\nAh, try it!\"\n\nMilady, finding her thoughts betrayed, dug her nails into her flesh to\nsubdue every emotion that might give to her face any expression except\nagony.\n\nLord de Winter continued: \"The officer who commands here in my absence\nyou have already seen, and therefore know him. He knows how, as you must\nhave observed, to obey an order--for you did not, I am sure, come from\nPortsmouth hither without endeavoring to make him speak. What do you say\nof him? Could a statue of marble have been more impassive and more mute?\nYou have already tried the power of your seductions upon many men, and\nunfortunately you have always succeeded; but I give you leave to try\nthem upon this one. PARDIEU! if you succeed with him, I pronounce you\nthe demon himself.\"\n\nHe went toward the door and opened it hastily.\n\n\"Call Mr. Felton,\" said he. \"Wait a minute longer, and I will introduce\nhim to you.\"\n\nThere followed between these two personages a strange silence, during\nwhich the sound of a slow and regular step was heard approaching.\nShortly a human form appeared in the shade of the corridor, and the\nyoung lieutenant, with whom we are already acquainted, stopped at the\nthreshold to receive the orders of the baron.\n\n\"Come in, my dear John,\" said Lord de Winter, \"come in, and shut the\ndoor.\"\n\nThe young officer entered.\n\n\"Now,\" said the baron, \"look at this woman. She is young; she is\nbeautiful; she possesses all earthly seductions. Well, she is a monster,\nwho, at twenty-five years of age, has been guilty of as many crimes as\nyou could read of in a year in the archives of our tribunals. Her voice\nprejudices her hearers in her favor; her beauty serves as a bait to\nher victims; her body even pays what she promises--I must do her that\njustice. She will try to seduce you, perhaps she will try to kill you.\nI have extricated you from misery, Felton; I have caused you to be named\nlieutenant; I once saved your life, you know on what occasion. I am for\nyou not only a protector, but a friend; not only a benefactor, but a\nfather. This woman has come back again into England for the purpose of\nconspiring against my life. I hold this serpent in my hands. Well, I\ncall you, and say to you: Friend Felton, John, my child, guard me, and\nmore particularly guard yourself, against this woman. Swear, by your\nhopes of salvation, to keep her safely for the chastisement she has\nmerited. John Felton, I trust your word! John Felton, I put faith in\nyour loyalty!\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" said the young officer, summoning to his mild countenance all\nthe hatred he could find in his heart, \"my Lord, I swear all shall be\ndone as you desire.\"\n\nMilady received this look like a resigned victim; it was impossible\nto imagine a more submissive or a more mild expression than that which\nprevailed on her beautiful countenance. Lord de Winter himself could\nscarcely recognize the tigress who, a minute before, prepared apparently\nfor a fight.\n\n\"She is not to leave this chamber, understand, John,\" continued the\nbaron. \"She is to correspond with nobody; she is to speak to no one but\nyou--if you will do her the honor to address a word to her.\"\n\n\"That is sufficient, my Lord! I have sworn.\"\n\n\"And now, madame, try to make your peace with God, for you are judged by\nmen!\"\n\nMilady let her head sink, as if crushed by this sentence. Lord de Winter\nwent out, making a sign to Felton, who followed him, shutting the door\nafter him.\n\nOne instant after, the heavy step of a marine who served as sentinel\nwas heard in the corridor--his ax in his girdle and his musket on his\nshoulder.\n\nMilady remained for some minutes in the same position, for she thought\nthey might perhaps be examining her through the keyhole; she then slowly\nraised her head, which had resumed its formidable expression of menace\nand defiance, ran to the door to listen, looked out of her window, and\nreturning to bury herself again in her large armchair, she reflected.\n\n\n\n\n51 OFFICER\n\nMeanwhile, the cardinal looked anxiously for news from England; but no\nnews arrived that was not annoying and threatening.\n\nAlthough La Rochelle was invested, however certain success might\nappear--thanks to the precautions taken, and above all to the dyke,\nwhich prevented the entrance of any vessel into the besieged city--the\nblockade might last a long time yet. This was a great affront to the\nking's army, and a great inconvenience to the cardinal, who had no\nlonger, it is true, to embroil Louis XIII with Anne of Austria--for that\naffair was over--but he had to adjust matters for M. de Bassompierre,\nwho was embroiled with the Duc d'Angouleme.\n\nAs to Monsieur, who had begun the siege, he left to the cardinal the\ntask of finishing it.\n\nThe city, notwithstanding the incredible perseverance of its mayor, had\nattempted a sort of mutiny for a surrender; the mayor had hanged the\nmutineers. This execution quieted the ill-disposed, who resolved to\nallow themselves to die of hunger--this death always appearing to them\nmore slow and less sure than strangulation.\n\nOn their side, from time to time, the besiegers took the messengers\nwhich the Rochellais sent to Buckingham, or the spies which Buckingham\nsent to the Rochellais. In one case or the other, the trial was soon\nover. The cardinal pronounced the single word, \"Hanged!\" The king was\ninvited to come and see the hanging. He came languidly, placing himself\nin a good situation to see all the details. This amused him sometimes\na little, and made him endure the siege with patience; but it did not\nprevent his getting very tired, or from talking at every moment of\nreturning to Paris--so that if the messengers and the spies had failed,\nhis Eminence, notwithstanding all his inventiveness, would have found\nhimself much embarrassed.\n\nNevertheless, time passed on, and the Rochellais did not surrender. The\nlast spy that was taken was the bearer of a letter. This letter told\nBuckingham that the city was at an extremity; but instead of adding, \"If\nyour succor does not arrive within fifteen days, we will surrender,\" it\nadded, quite simply, \"If your succor comes not within fifteen days, we\nshall all be dead with hunger when it comes.\"\n\nThe Rochellais, then, had no hope but in Buckingham. Buckingham was\ntheir Messiah. It was evident that if they one day learned positively\nthat they must not count on Buckingham, their courage would fail with\ntheir hope.\n\nThe cardinal looked, then, with great impatience for the news from\nEngland which would announce to him that Buckingham would not come.\n\nThe question of carrying the city by assault, though often debated in\nthe council of the king, had been always rejected. In the first place,\nLa Rochelle appeared impregnable. Then the cardinal, whatever he said,\nvery well knew that the horror of bloodshed in this encounter, in which\nFrenchman would combat against Frenchman, was a retrograde movement\nof sixty years impressed upon his policy; and the cardinal was at that\nperiod what we now call a man of progress. In fact, the sack of La\nRochelle, and the assassination of three of four thousand Huguenots who\nallowed themselves to be killed, would resemble too closely, in 1628,\nthe massacre of St. Bartholomew in 1572; and then, above all this,\nthis extreme measure, which was not at all repugnant to the king, good\nCatholic as he was, always fell before this argument of the besieging\ngenerals--La Rochelle is impregnable except to famine.\n\nThe cardinal could not drive from his mind the fear he entertained of\nhis terrible emissary--for he comprehended the strange qualities of this\nwoman, sometimes a serpent, sometimes a lion. Had she betrayed him? Was\nshe dead? He knew her well enough in all cases to know that, whether\nacting for or against him, as a friend or an enemy, she would not remain\nmotionless without great impediments; but whence did these impediments\narise? That was what he could not know.\n\nAnd yet he reckoned, and with reason, on Milady. He had divined in the\npast of this woman terrible things which his red mantle alone could\ncover; and he felt, from one cause or another, that this woman was his\nown, as she could look to no other but himself for a support superior to\nthe danger which threatened her.\n\nHe resolved, then, to carry on the war alone, and to look for no success\nforeign to himself, but as we look for a fortunate chance. He continued\nto press the raising of the famous dyke which was to starve La Rochelle.\nMeanwhile, he cast his eyes over that unfortunate city, which contained\nso much deep misery and so many heroic virtues, and recalling the\nsaying of Louis XI, his political predecessor, as he himself was the\npredecessor of Robespierre, he repeated this maxim of Tristan's gossip:\n\"Divide in order to reign.\"\n\nHenry IV, when besieging Paris, had loaves and provisions thrown\nover the walls. The cardinal had little notes thrown over in which he\nrepresented to the Rochellais how unjust, selfish, and barbarous was the\nconduct of their leaders. These leaders had corn in abundance, and would\nnot let them partake of it; they adopted as a maxim--for they, too, had\nmaxims--that it was of very little consequence that women, children,\nand old men should die, so long as the men who were to defend the walls\nremained strong and healthy. Up to that time, whether from devotedness\nor from want of power to act against it, this maxim, without being\ngenerally adopted, nevertheless passed from theory into practice; but\nthe notes did it injury. The notes reminded the men that the children,\nwomen, and old men whom they allowed to die were their sons, their\nwives, and their fathers, and that it would be more just for everyone to\nbe reduced to the common misery, in order that equal conditions should\ngive birth to unanimous resolutions.\n\nThese notes had all the effect that he who wrote them could expect,\nin that they induced a great number of the inhabitants to open private\nnegotiations with the royal army.\n\nBut at the moment when the cardinal saw his means already bearing fruit,\nand applauded himself for having put it in action, an inhabitant of La\nRochelle who had contrived to pass the royal lines--God knows how,\nsuch was the watchfulness of Bassompierre, Schomberg, and the Duc\nd'Angouleme, themselves watched over by the cardinal--an inhabitant\nof La Rochelle, we say, entered the city, coming from Portsmouth, and\nsaying that he had seen a magnificent fleet ready to sail within eight\ndays. Still further, Buckingham announced to the mayor that at length\nthe great league was about to declare itself against France, and that\nthe kingdom would be at once invaded by the English, Imperial, and\nSpanish armies. This letter was read publicly in all parts of the city.\nCopies were put up at the corners of the streets; and even they who had\nbegun to open negotiations interrupted them, being resolved to await the\nsuccor so pompously announced.\n\nThis unexpected circumstance brought back Richelieu's former anxiety,\nand forced him in spite of himself once more to turn his eyes to the\nother side of the sea.\n\nDuring this time, exempt from the anxiety of its only and true chief,\nthe royal army led a joyous life, neither provisions nor money being\nwanting in the camp. All the corps rivaled one another in audacity and\ngaiety. To take spies and hang them, to make hazardous expeditions\nupon the dyke or the sea, to imagine wild plans, and to execute them\ncoolly--such were the pastimes which made the army find these days short\nwhich were not only so long to the Rochellais, a prey to famine and\nanxiety, but even to the cardinal, who blockaded them so closely.\n\nSometimes when the cardinal, always on horseback, like the lowest\nGENDARME of the army, cast a pensive glance over those works, so slowly\nkeeping pace with his wishes, which the engineers, brought from all\nthe corners of France, were executing under his orders, if he met a\nMusketeer of the company of Treville, he drew near and looked at him\nin a peculiar manner, and not recognizing in him one of our four\ncompanions, he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in\nanother direction.\n\nOne day when oppressed with a mortal weariness of mind, without hope in\nthe negotiations with the city, without news from England, the cardinal\nwent out, without any other aim than to be out of doors, and accompanied\nonly by Cahusac and La Houdiniere, strolled along the beach. Mingling\nthe immensity of his dreams with the immensity of the ocean, he came,\nhis horse going at a foot's pace, to a hill from the top of which he\nperceived behind a hedge, reclining on the sand and catching in its\npassage one of those rays of the sun so rare at this period of the\nyear, seven men surrounded by empty bottles. Four of these men were\nour Musketeers, preparing to listen to a letter one of them had just\nreceived. This letter was so important that it made them forsake their\ncards and their dice on the drumhead.\n\nThe other three were occupied in opening an enormous flagon of Collicure\nwine; these were the lackeys of these gentlemen.\n\nThe cardinal was, as we have said, in very low spirits; and nothing when\nhe was in that state of mind increased his depression so much as gaiety\nin others. Besides, he had another strange fancy, which was always to\nbelieve that the causes of his sadness created the gaiety of others.\nMaking a sign to La Houdiniere and Cahusac to stop, he alighted from\nhis horse, and went toward these suspected merry companions, hoping, by\nmeans of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and of the hedge\nwhich concealed his approach, to catch some words of this conversation\nwhich appeared so interesting. At ten paces from the hedge he recognized\nthe talkative Gascon; and as he had already perceived that these men\nwere Musketeers, he did not doubt that the three others were those\ncalled the Inseparables; that is to say, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.\n\nIt may be supposed that his desire to hear the conversation was\naugmented by this discovery. His eyes took a strange expression, and\nwith the step of a tiger-cat he advanced toward the hedge; but he had\nnot been able to catch more than a few vague syllables without any\npositive sense, when a sonorous and short cry made him start, and\nattracted the attention of the Musketeers.\n\n\"Officer!\" cried Grimaud.\n\n\"You are speaking, you scoundrel!\" said Athos, rising upon his elbow,\nand transfixing Grimaud with his flaming look.\n\nGrimaud therefore added nothing to his speech, but contented himself\nwith pointing his index finger in the direction of the hedge, announcing\nby this gesture the cardinal and his escort.\n\nWith a single bound the Musketeers were on their feet, and saluted with\nrespect.\n\nThe cardinal seemed furious.\n\n\"It appears that Messieurs the Musketeers keep guard,\" said he. \"Are\nthe English expected by land, or do the Musketeers consider themselves\nsuperior officers?\"\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" replied Athos, for amid the general fright he alone\nhad preserved the noble calmness and coolness that never forsook him,\n\"Monseigneur, the Musketeers, when they are not on duty, or when their\nduty is over, drink and play at dice, and they are certainly superior\nofficers to their lackeys.\"\n\n\"Lackeys?\" grumbled the cardinal. \"Lackeys who have the order to warn\ntheir masters when anyone passes are not lackeys, they are sentinels.\"\n\n\"Your Eminence may perceive that if we had not taken this precaution, we\nshould have been exposed to allowing you to pass without presenting you\nour respects or offering you our thanks for the favor you have done us\nin uniting us. D'Artagnan,\" continued Athos, \"you, who but lately were\nso anxious for such an opportunity for expressing your gratitude to\nMonseigneur, here it is; avail yourself of it.\"\n\nThese words were pronounced with that imperturbable phlegm which\ndistinguished Athos in the hour of danger, and with that excessive\npoliteness which made of him at certain moments a king more majestic\nthan kings by birth.\n\nD'Artagnan came forward and stammered out a few words of gratitude which\nsoon expired under the gloomy looks of the cardinal.\n\n\"It does not signify, gentlemen,\" continued the cardinal, without\nappearing to be in the least swerved from his first intention by the\ndiversion which Athos had started, \"it does not signify, gentlemen. I\ndo not like to have simple soldiers, because they have the advantage of\nserving in a privileged corps, thus to play the great lords; discipline\nis the same for them as for everybody else.\"\n\nAthos allowed the cardinal to finish his sentence completely, and\nbowed in sign of assent. Then he resumed in his turn: \"Discipline,\nMonseigneur, has, I hope, in no way been forgotten by us. We are not\non duty, and we believed that not being on duty we were at liberty to\ndispose of our time as we pleased. If we are so fortunate as to have\nsome particular duty to perform for your Eminence, we are ready to obey\nyou. Your Eminence may perceive,\" continued Athos, knitting his brow,\nfor this sort of investigation began to annoy him, \"that we have not\ncome out without our arms.\"\n\nAnd he showed the cardinal, with his finger, the four muskets piled near\nthe drum, on which were the cards and dice.\n\n\"Your Eminence may believe,\" added d'Artagnan, \"that we would have come\nto meet you, if we could have supposed it was Monseigneur coming toward\nus with so few attendants.\"\n\nThe cardinal bit his mustache, and even his lips a little.\n\n\"Do you know what you look like, all together, as you are armed and\nguarded by your lackeys?\" said the cardinal. \"You look like four\nconspirators.\"\n\n\"Oh, as to that, Monseigneur, it is true,\" said Athos; \"we do conspire,\nas your Eminence might have seen the other morning. Only we conspire\nagainst the Rochellais.\"\n\n\"Ah, you gentlemen of policy!\" replied the cardinal, knitting his brow\nin his turn, \"the secret of many unknown things might perhaps be found\nin your brains, if we could read them as you read that letter which you\nconcealed as soon as you saw me coming.\"\n\nThe color mounted to the face of Athos, and he made a step toward his\nEminence.\n\n\"One might think you really suspected us, monseigneur, and we were\nundergoing a real interrogatory. If it be so, we trust your Eminence\nwill deign to explain yourself, and we should then at least be\nacquainted with our real position.\"\n\n\"And if it were an interrogatory!\" replied the cardinal. \"Others besides\nyou have undergone such, Monsieur Athos, and have replied thereto.\"\n\n\"Thus I have told your Eminence that you had but to question us, and we\nare ready to reply.\"\n\n\"What was that letter you were about to read, Monsieur Aramis, and which\nyou so promptly concealed?\"\n\n\"A woman's letter, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, I see,\" said the cardinal; \"we must be discreet with this sort\nof letters; but nevertheless, we may show them to a confessor, and you\nknow I have taken orders.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" said Athos, with a calmness the more terrible because he\nrisked his head in making this reply, \"the letter is a woman's letter,\nbut it is neither signed Marion de Lorme, nor Madame d'Aiguillon.\"\n\nThe cardinal became as pale as death; lightning darted from his eyes. He\nturned round as if to give an order to Cahusac and Houdiniere. Athos saw\nthe movement; he made a step toward the muskets, upon which the other\nthree friends had fixed their eyes, like men ill-disposed to allow\nthemselves to be taken. The cardinalists were three; the Musketeers,\nlackeys included, were seven. He judged that the match would be so much\nthe less equal, if Athos and his companions were really plotting; and by\none of those rapid turns which he always had at command, all his anger\nfaded away into a smile.\n\n\"Well, well!\" said he, \"you are brave young men, proud in daylight,\nfaithful in darkness. We can find no fault with you for watching over\nyourselves, when you watch so carefully over others. Gentlemen, I have\nnot forgotten the night in which you served me as an escort to the Red\nDovecot. If there were any danger to be apprehended on the road I am\ngoing, I would request you to accompany me; but as there is none, remain\nwhere you are, finish your bottles, your game, and your letter. Adieu,\ngentlemen!\"\n\nAnd remounting his horse, which Cahusac led to him, he saluted them with\nhis hand, and rode away.\n\nThe four young men, standing and motionless, followed him with their\neyes without speaking a single word until he had disappeared. Then they\nlooked at one another.\n\nThe countenances of all gave evidence of terror, for notwithstanding the\nfriendly adieu of his Eminence, they plainly perceived that the cardinal\nwent away with rage in his heart.\n\nAthos alone smiled, with a self-possessed, disdainful smile.\n\nWhen the cardinal was out of hearing and sight, \"That Grimaud kept bad\nwatch!\" cried Porthos, who had a great inclination to vent his ill-humor\non somebody.\n\nGrimaud was about to reply to excuse himself. Athos lifted his finger,\nand Grimaud was silent.\n\n\"Would you have given up the letter, Aramis?\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"I,\" said Aramis, in his most flutelike tone, \"I had made up my mind.\nIf he had insisted upon the letter being given up to him, I would have\npresented the letter to him with one hand, and with the other I would\nhave run my sword through his body.\"\n\n\"I expected as much,\" said Athos; \"and that was why I threw myself\nbetween you and him. Indeed, this man is very much to blame for talking\nthus to other men; one would say he had never had to do with any but\nwomen and children.\"\n\n\"My dear Athos, I admire you, but nevertheless we were in the wrong,\nafter all.\"\n\n\"How, in the wrong?\" said Athos. \"Whose, then, is the air we breathe?\nWhose is the ocean upon which we look? Whose is the sand upon which we\nwere reclining? Whose is that letter of your mistress? Do these belong\nto the cardinal? Upon my honor, this man fancies the world belongs to\nhim. There you stood, stammering, stupefied, annihilated. One might have\nsupposed the Bastille appeared before you, and that the gigantic Medusa\nhad converted you into stone. Is being in love conspiring? You are in\nlove with a woman whom the cardinal has caused to be shut up, and you\nwish to get her out of the hands of the cardinal. That's a match you\nare playing with his Eminence; this letter is your game. Why should you\nexpose your game to your adversary? That is never done. Let him find it\nout if he can! We can find out his!\"\n\n\"Well, that's all very sensible, Athos,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"In that case, let there be no more question of what's past, and let\nAramis resume the letter from his cousin where the cardinal interrupted\nhim.\"\n\nAramis drew the letter from his pocket; the three friends surrounded\nhim, and the three lackeys grouped themselves again near the wine jar.\n\n\"You had only read a line or two,\" said d'Artagnan; \"read the letter\nagain from the commencement.\"\n\n\"Willingly,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"My dear Cousin, I think I shall make up my mind to set out for Bethune,\nwhere my sister has placed our little servant in the convent of the\nCarmelites; this poor child is quite resigned, as she knows she cannot\nlive elsewhere without the salvation of her soul being in danger.\nNevertheless, if the affairs of our family are arranged, as we hope\nthey will be, I believe she will run the risk of being damned, and will\nreturn to those she regrets, particularly as she knows they are always\nthinking of her. Meanwhile, she is not very wretched; what she most\ndesires is a letter from her intended. I know that such viands pass with\ndifficulty through convent gratings; but after all, as I have given you\nproofs, my dear cousin, I am not unskilled in such affairs, and I will\ntake charge of the commission. My sister thanks you for your good and\neternal remembrance. She has experienced much anxiety; but she is now at\nlength a little reassured, having sent her secretary away in order that\nnothing may happen unexpectedly.\n\n\"Adieu, my dear cousin. Tell us news of yourself as often as you can;\nthat is to say, as often as you can with safety. I embrace you.\n\n\"Marie Michon.\"\n\n\"Oh, what do I not owe you, Aramis?\" said d'Artagnan. \"Dear Constance!\nI have at length, then, intelligence of you. She lives; she is in safety\nin a convent; she is at Bethune! Where is Bethune, Athos?\"\n\n\"Why, upon the frontiers of Artois and of Flanders. The siege once over,\nwe shall be able to make a tour in that direction.\"\n\n\"And that will not be long, it is to be hoped,\" said Porthos; \"for they\nhave this morning hanged a spy who confessed that the Rochellais were\nreduced to the leather of their shoes. Supposing that after having eaten\nthe leather they eat the soles, I cannot see much that is left unless\nthey eat one another.\"\n\n\"Poor fools!\" said Athos, emptying a glass of excellent Bordeaux wine\nwhich, without having at that period the reputation it now enjoys,\nmerited it no less, \"poor fools! As if the Catholic religion was not\nthe most advantageous and the most agreeable of all religions! All the\nsame,\" resumed he, after having clicked his tongue against his palate,\n\"they are brave fellows! But what the devil are you about, Aramis?\"\ncontinued Athos. \"Why, you are squeezing that letter into your pocket!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said d'Artagnan, \"Athos is right, it must be burned. And yet\nif we burn it, who knows whether Monsieur Cardinal has not a secret to\ninterrogate ashes?\"\n\n\"He must have one,\" said Athos.\n\n\"What will you do with the letter, then?\" asked Porthos.\n\n\"Come here, Grimaud,\" said Athos. Grimaud rose and obeyed. \"As a\npunishment for having spoken without permission, my friend, you will\nplease to eat this piece of paper; then to recompense you for the\nservice you will have rendered us, you shall afterward drink this glass\nof wine. First, here is the letter. Eat heartily.\"\n\nGrimaud smiled; and with his eyes fixed upon the glass which Athos\nheld in his hand, he ground the paper well between his teeth and then\nswallowed it.\n\n\"Bravo, Monsieur Grimaud!\" said Athos; \"and now take this. That's well.\nWe dispense with your saying grace.\"\n\nGrimaud silently swallowed the glass of Bordeaux wine; but his eyes,\nraised toward heaven during this delicious occupation, spoke a language\nwhich, though mute, was not the less expressive.\n\n\"And now,\" said Athos, \"unless Monsieur Cardinal should form the\ningenious idea of ripping up Grimaud, I think we may be pretty much at\nour ease respecting the letter.\"\n\nMeantime, his Eminence continued his melancholy ride, murmuring between\nhis mustaches, \"These four men must positively be mine.\"\n\n\n\n\n52 CAPTIVITY: THE FIRST DAY\n\nLet us return to Milady, whom a glance thrown upon the coast of France\nhas made us lose sight of for an instant.\n\nWe shall find her still in the despairing attitude in which we left her,\nplunged in an abyss of dismal reflection--a dark hell at the gate of\nwhich she has almost left hope behind, because for the first time she\ndoubts, for the first time she fears.\n\nOn two occasions her fortune has failed her, on two occasions she has\nfound herself discovered and betrayed; and on these two occasions it was\nto one fatal genius, sent doubtlessly by the Lord to combat her, that\nshe has succumbed. D'Artagnan has conquered her--her, that invincible\npower of evil.\n\nHe has deceived her in her love, humbled her in her pride, thwarted her\nin her ambition; and now he ruins her fortune, deprives her of liberty,\nand even threatens her life. Still more, he has lifted the corner of her\nmask--that shield with which she covered herself and which rendered her\nso strong.\n\nD'Artagnan has turned aside from Buckingham, whom she hates as she hates\neveryone she has loved, the tempest with which Richelieu threatened him\nin the person of the queen. D'Artagnan had passed himself upon her as de\nWardes, for whom she had conceived one of those tigerlike fancies common\nto women of her character. D'Artagnan knows that terrible secret which\nshe has sworn no one shall know without dying. In short, at the moment\nin which she has just obtained from Richelieu a carte blanche by\nthe means of which she is about to take vengeance on her enemy, this\nprecious paper is torn from her hands, and it is d'Artagnan who holds\nher prisoner and is about to send her to some filthy Botany Bay, some\ninfamous Tyburn of the Indian Ocean.\n\nAll this she owes to d'Artagnan, without doubt. From whom can come so\nmany disgraces heaped upon her head, if not from him? He alone could\nhave transmitted to Lord de Winter all these frightful secrets which he\nhas discovered, one after another, by a train of fatalities. He knows\nher brother-in-law. He must have written to him.\n\nWhat hatred she distills! Motionless, with her burning and fixed\nglances, in her solitary apartment, how well the outbursts of passion\nwhich at times escape from the depths of her chest with her respiration,\naccompany the sound of the surf which rises, growls, roars, and breaks\nitself like an eternal and powerless despair against the rocks on which\nis built this dark and lofty castle! How many magnificent projects\nof vengeance she conceives by the light of the flashes which her\ntempestuous passion casts over her mind against Mme. Bonacieux, against\nBuckingham, but above all against d'Artagnan--projects lost in the\ndistance of the future.\n\nYes; but in order to avenge herself she must be free. And to be free,\na prisoner has to pierce a wall, detach bars, cut through a floor--all\nundertakings which a patient and strong man may accomplish, but before\nwhich the feverish irritations of a woman must give way. Besides, to do\nall this, time is necessary--months, years; and she has ten or twelve\ndays, as Lord de Winter, her fraternal and terrible jailer, has told\nher.\n\nAnd yet, if she were a man she would attempt all this, and perhaps might\nsucceed; why, then, did heaven make the mistake of placing that manlike\nsoul in that frail and delicate body?\n\nThe first moments of her captivity were terrible; a few convulsions of\nrage which she could not suppress paid her debt of feminine weakness to\nnature. But by degrees she overcame the outbursts of her mad passion;\nand nervous tremblings which agitated her frame disappeared, and she\nremained folded within herself like a fatigued serpent in repose.\n\n\"Go to, go to! I must have been mad to allow myself to be carried away\nso,\" says she, gazing into the glass, which reflects back to her eyes\nthe burning glance by which she appears to interrogate herself. \"No\nviolence; violence is the proof of weakness. In the first place, I have\nnever succeeded by that means. Perhaps if I employed my strength against\nwomen I might perchance find them weaker than myself, and consequently\nconquer them; but it is with men that I struggle, and I am but a\nwoman to them. Let me fight like a woman, then; my strength is in my\nweakness.\"\n\nThen, as if to render an account to herself of the changes she could\nplace upon her countenance, so mobile and so expressive, she made it\ntake all expressions from that of passionate anger, which convulsed\nher features, to that of the most sweet, most affectionate, and most\nseducing smile. Then her hair assumed successively, under her skillful\nhands, all the undulations she thought might assist the charms of her\nface. At length she murmured, satisfied with herself, \"Come, nothing is\nlost; I am still beautiful.\"\n\nIt was then nearly eight o'clock in the evening. Milady perceived a bed;\nshe calculated that the repose of a few hours would not only refresh her\nhead and her ideas, but still further, her complexion. A better idea,\nhowever, came into her mind before going to bed. She had heard something\nsaid about supper. She had already been an hour in this apartment; they\ncould not long delay bringing her a repast. The prisoner did not wish to\nlose time; and she resolved to make that very evening some attempts to\nascertain the nature of the ground she had to work upon, by studying the\ncharacters of the men to whose guardianship she was committed.\n\nA light appeared under the door; this light announced the reappearance\nof her jailers. Milady, who had arisen, threw herself quickly into\nthe armchair, her head thrown back, her beautiful hair unbound and\ndisheveled, her bosom half bare beneath her crumpled lace, one hand on\nher heart, and the other hanging down.\n\nThe bolts were drawn; the door groaned upon its hinges. Steps sounded in\nthe chamber, and drew near.\n\n\"Place that table there,\" said a voice which the prisoner recognized as\nthat of Felton.\n\nThe order was executed.\n\n\"You will bring lights, and relieve the sentinel,\" continued Felton.\n\nAnd this double order which the young lieutenant gave to the same\nindividuals proved to Milady that her servants were the same men as her\nguards; that is to say, soldiers.\n\nFelton's orders were, for the rest, executed with a silent rapidity that\ngave a good idea of the way in which he maintained discipline.\n\nAt length Felton, who had not yet looked at Milady, turned toward her.\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" said he, \"she is asleep; that's well. When she wakes she can\nsup.\" And he made some steps toward the door.\n\n\"But, my lieutenant,\" said a soldier, less stoical than his chief, and\nwho had approached Milady, \"this woman is not asleep.\"\n\n\"What, not asleep!\" said Felton; \"what is she doing, then?\"\n\n\"She has fainted. Her face is very pale, and I have listened in vain; I\ndo not hear her breathe.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said Felton, after having looked at Milady from the\nspot on which he stood without moving a step toward her. \"Go and tell\nLord de Winter that his prisoner has fainted--for this event not having\nbeen foreseen, I don't know what to do.\"\n\nThe soldier went out to obey the orders of his officer. Felton sat down\nupon an armchair which happened to be near the door, and waited without\nspeaking a word, without making a gesture. Milady possessed that great\nart, so much studied by women, of looking through her long eyelashes\nwithout appearing to open the lids. She perceived Felton, who sat\nwith his back toward her. She continued to look at him for nearly ten\nminutes, and in these ten minutes the immovable guardian never turned\nround once.\n\nShe then thought that Lord de Winter would come, and by his presence\ngive fresh strength to her jailer. Her first trial was lost; she acted\nlike a woman who reckons up her resources. As a result she raised her\nhead, opened her eyes, and sighed deeply.\n\nAt this sigh Felton turned round.\n\n\"Ah, you are awake, madame,\" he said; \"then I have nothing more to do\nhere. If you want anything you can ring.\"\n\n\"Oh, my God, my God! how I have suffered!\" said Milady, in that\nharmonious voice which, like that of the ancient enchantresses, charmed\nall whom she wished to destroy.\n\nAnd she assumed, upon sitting up in the armchair, a still more graceful\nand abandoned position than when she reclined.\n\nFelton arose.\n\n\"You will be served, thus, madame, three times a day,\" said he. \"In the\nmorning at nine o'clock, in the day at one o'clock, and in the evening\nat eight. If that does not suit you, you can point out what other hours\nyou prefer, and in this respect your wishes will be complied with.\"\n\n\"But am I to remain always alone in this vast and dismal chamber?\" asked\nMilady.\n\n\"A woman of the neighbourhood has been sent for, who will be tomorrow at\nthe castle, and will return as often as you desire her presence.\"\n\n\"I thank you, sir,\" replied the prisoner, humbly.\n\nFelton made a slight bow, and directed his steps toward the door. At the\nmoment he was about to go out, Lord de Winter appeared in the corridor,\nfollowed by the soldier who had been sent to inform him of the swoon of\nMilady. He held a vial of salts in his hand.\n\n\"Well, what is it--what is going on here?\" said he, in a jeering voice,\non seeing the prisoner sitting up and Felton about to go out. \"Is this\ncorpse come to life already? Felton, my lad, did you not perceive that\nyou were taken for a novice, and that the first act was being performed\nof a comedy of which we shall doubtless have the pleasure of following\nout all the developments?\"\n\n\"I thought so, my lord,\" said Felton; \"but as the prisoner is a woman,\nafter all, I wish to pay her the attention that every man of gentle\nbirth owes to a woman, if not on her account, at least on my own.\"\n\nMilady shuddered through her whole system. These words of Felton's\npassed like ice through her veins.\n\n\"So,\" replied de Winter, laughing, \"that beautiful hair so skillfully\ndisheveled, that white skin, and that languishing look, have not yet\nseduced you, you heart of stone?\"\n\n\"No, my Lord,\" replied the impassive young man; \"your Lordship may be\nassured that it requires more than the tricks and coquetry of a woman to\ncorrupt me.\"\n\n\"In that case, my brave lieutenant, let us leave Milady to find out\nsomething else, and go to supper; but be easy! She has a fruitful\nimagination, and the second act of the comedy will not delay its steps\nafter the first.\"\n\nAnd at these words Lord de Winter passed his arm through that of Felton,\nand led him out, laughing.\n\n\"Oh, I will be a match for you!\" murmured Milady, between her teeth; \"be\nassured of that, you poor spoiled monk, you poor converted soldier, who\nhas cut his uniform out of a monk's frock!\"\n\n\"By the way,\" resumed de Winter, stopping at the threshold of the door,\n\"you must not, Milady, let this check take away your appetite. Taste\nthat fowl and those fish. On my honor, they are not poisoned. I have\na very good cook, and he is not to be my heir; I have full and perfect\nconfidence in him. Do as I do. Adieu, dear sister, till your next\nswoon!\"\n\nThis was all that Milady could endure. Her hands clutched her armchair;\nshe ground her teeth inwardly; her eyes followed the motion of the door\nas it closed behind Lord de Winter and Felton, and the moment she was\nalone a fresh fit of despair seized her. She cast her eyes upon the\ntable, saw the glittering of a knife, rushed toward it and clutched it;\nbut her disappointment was cruel. The blade was round, and of flexible\nsilver.\n\nA burst of laughter resounded from the other side of the ill-closed\ndoor, and the door reopened.\n\n\"Ha, ha!\" cried Lord de Winter; \"ha, ha! Don't you see, my brave Felton;\ndon't you see what I told you? That knife was for you, my lad; she would\nhave killed you. Observe, this is one of her peculiarities, to get rid\nthus, after one fashion or another, of all the people who bother her. If\nI had listened to you, the knife would have been pointed and of steel.\nThen no more of Felton; she would have cut your throat, and after that\neverybody else's. See, John, see how well she knows how to handle a\nknife.\"\n\nIn fact, Milady still held the harmless weapon in her clenched hand; but\nthese last words, this supreme insult, relaxed her hands, her strength,\nand even her will. The knife fell to the ground.\n\n\"You were right, my Lord,\" said Felton, with a tone of profound disgust\nwhich sounded to the very bottom of the heart of Milady, \"you were\nright, my Lord, and I was wrong.\"\n\nAnd both again left the room.\n\nBut this time Milady lent a more attentive ear than the first, and she\nheard their steps die away in the distance of the corridor.\n\n\"I am lost,\" murmured she; \"I am lost! I am in the power of men upon\nwhom I can have no more influence than upon statues of bronze or\ngranite; they know me by heart, and are steeled against all my weapons.\nIt is, however, impossible that this should end as they have decreed!\"\n\nIn fact, as this last reflection indicated--this instinctive return to\nhope--sentiments of weakness or fear did not dwell long in her ardent\nspirit. Milady sat down to table, ate from several dishes, drank a\nlittle Spanish wine, and felt all her resolution return.\n\nBefore she went to bed she had pondered, analyzed, turned on all sides,\nexamined on all points, the words, the steps, the gestures, the signs,\nand even the silence of her interlocutors; and of this profound,\nskillful, and anxious study the result was that Felton, everything\nconsidered, appeared the more vulnerable of her two persecutors.\n\nOne expression above all recurred to the mind of the prisoner: \"If I had\nlistened to you,\" Lord de Winter had said to Felton.\n\nFelton, then, had spoken in her favor, since Lord de Winter had not been\nwilling to listen to him.\n\n\"Weak or strong,\" repeated Milady, \"that man has, then, a spark of pity\nin his soul; of that spark I will make a flame that shall devour him. As\nto the other, he knows me, he fears me, and knows what he has to expect\nof me if ever I escape from his hands. It is useless, then, to attempt\nanything with him. But Felton--that's another thing. He is a young,\ningenuous, pure man who seems virtuous; him there are means of\ndestroying.\"\n\nAnd Milady went to bed and fell asleep with a smile upon her lips.\nAnyone who had seen her sleeping might have said she was a young girl\ndreaming of the crown of flowers she was to wear on her brow at the next\nfestival.\n\n\n\n\n53 CAPTIVITY: THE SECOND DAY\n\nMilady dreamed that she at length had d'Artagnan in her power, that she\nwas present at his execution; and it was the sight of his odious blood,\nflowing beneath the ax of the headsman, which spread that charming smile\nupon her lips.\n\nShe slept as a prisoner sleeps, rocked by his first hope.\n\nIn the morning, when they entered her chamber she was still in bed.\nFelton remained in the corridor. He brought with him the woman of whom\nhe had spoken the evening before, and who had just arrived; this woman\nentered, and approaching Milady's bed, offered her services.\n\nMilady was habitually pale; her complexion might therefore deceive a\nperson who saw her for the first time.\n\n\"I am in a fever,\" said she; \"I have not slept a single instant during\nall this long night. I suffer horribly. Are you likely to be more humane\nto me than others were yesterday? All I ask is permission to remain\nabed.\"\n\n\"Would you like to have a physician called?\" said the woman.\n\nFelton listened to this dialogue without speaking a word.\n\nMilady reflected that the more people she had around her the more she\nwould have to work upon, and Lord de Winter would redouble his watch.\nBesides, the physician might declare the ailment feigned; and Milady,\nafter having lost the first trick, was not willing to lose the second.\n\n\"Go and fetch a physician?\" said she. \"What could be the good of that?\nThese gentlemen declared yesterday that my illness was a comedy; it\nwould be just the same today, no doubt--for since yesterday evening they\nhave had plenty of time to send for a doctor.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Felton, who became impatient, \"say yourself, madame, what\ntreatment you wish followed.\"\n\n\"Eh, how can I tell? My God! I know that I suffer, that's all. Give me\nanything you like, it is of little consequence.\"\n\n\"Go and fetch Lord de Winter,\" said Felton, tired of these eternal\ncomplaints.\n\n\"Oh, no, no!\" cried Milady; \"no, sir, do not call him, I conjure you. I\nam well, I want nothing; do not call him.\"\n\nShe gave so much vehemence, such magnetic eloquence to this exclamation,\nthat Felton in spite of himself advanced some steps into the room.\n\n\"He has come!\" thought Milady.\n\n\"Meanwhile, madame, if you really suffer,\" said Felton, \"a physician\nshall be sent for; and if you deceive us--well, it will be the worse\nfor you. But at least we shall not have to reproach ourselves with\nanything.\"\n\nMilady made no reply, but turning her beautiful head round upon her\npillow, she burst into tears, and uttered heartbreaking sobs.\n\nFelton surveyed her for an instant with his usual impassiveness; then,\nseeing that the crisis threatened to be prolonged, he went out. The\nwoman followed him, and Lord de Winter did not appear.\n\n\"I fancy I begin to see my way,\" murmured Milady, with a savage joy,\nburying herself under the clothes to conceal from anybody who might be\nwatching her this burst of inward satisfaction.\n\nTwo hours passed away.\n\n\"Now it is time that the malady should be over,\" said she; \"let me rise,\nand obtain some success this very day. I have but ten days, and this\nevening two of them will be gone.\"\n\nIn the morning, when they entered Milady's chamber they had brought her\nbreakfast. Now, she thought, they could not long delay coming to clear\nthe table, and that Felton would then reappear.\n\nMilady was not deceived. Felton reappeared, and without observing\nwhether Milady had or had not touched her repast, made a sign that the\ntable should be carried out of the room, it having been brought in ready\nspread.\n\nFelton remained behind; he held a book in his hand.\n\nMilady, reclining in an armchair near the chimney, beautiful, pale, and\nresigned, looked like a holy virgin awaiting martyrdom.\n\nFelton approached her, and said, \"Lord de Winter, who is a Catholic,\nlike yourself, madame, thinking that the deprivation of the rites and\nceremonies of your church might be painful to you, has consented that\nyou should read every day the ordinary of your Mass; and here is a book\nwhich contains the ritual.\"\n\nAt the manner in which Felton laid the book upon the little table near\nwhich Milady was sitting, at the tone in which he pronounced the two\nwords, YOUR MASS, at the disdainful smile with which he accompanied\nthem, Milady raised her head, and looked more attentively at the\nofficer.\n\nBy that plain arrangement of the hair, by that costume of extreme\nsimplicity, by the brow polished like marble and as hard and\nimpenetrable, she recognized one of those gloomy Puritans she had so\noften met, not only in the court of King James, but in that of the King\nof France, where, in spite of the remembrance of the St. Bartholomew,\nthey sometimes came to seek refuge.\n\nShe then had one of those sudden inspirations which only people of\ngenius receive in great crises, in supreme moments which are to decide\ntheir fortunes or their lives.\n\nThose two words, YOUR MASS, and a simple glance cast upon Felton,\nrevealed to her all the importance of the reply she was about to make;\nbut with that rapidity of intelligence which was peculiar to her, this\nreply, ready arranged, presented itself to her lips:\n\n\"I?\" said she, with an accent of disdain in unison with that which she\nhad remarked in the voice of the young officer, \"I, sir? MY MASS? Lord\nde Winter, the corrupted Catholic, knows very well that I am not of his\nreligion, and this is a snare he wishes to lay for me!\"\n\n\"And of what religion are you, then, madame?\" asked Felton, with an\nastonishment which in spite of the empire he held over himself he could\nnot entirely conceal.\n\n\"I will tell it,\" cried Milady, with a feigned exultation, \"on the day\nwhen I shall have suffered sufficiently for my faith.\"\n\nThe look of Felton revealed to Milady the full extent of the space she\nhad opened for herself by this single word.\n\nThe young officer, however, remained mute and motionless; his look alone\nhad spoken.\n\n\"I am in the hands of my enemies,\" continued she, with that tone of\nenthusiasm which she knew was familiar to the Puritans. \"Well, let my\nGod save me, or let me perish for my God! That is the reply I beg you to\nmake to Lord de Winter. And as to this book,\" added she, pointing to\nthe manual with her finger but without touching it, as if she must be\ncontaminated by it, \"you may carry it back and make use of it yourself,\nfor doubtless you are doubly the accomplice of Lord de Winter--the\naccomplice in his persecutions, the accomplice in his heresies.\"\n\nFelton made no reply, took the book with the same appearance of\nrepugnance which he had before manifested, and retired pensively.\n\nLord de Winter came toward five o'clock in the evening. Milady had had\ntime, during the whole day, to trace her plan of conduct. She received\nhim like a woman who had already recovered all her advantages.\n\n\"It appears,\" said the baron, seating himself in the armchair opposite\nthat occupied by Milady, and stretching out his legs carelessly upon the\nhearth, \"it appears we have made a little apostasy!\"\n\n\"What do you mean, sir!\"\n\n\"I mean to say that since we last met you have changed your religion.\nYou have not by chance married a Protestant for a third husband, have\nyou?\"\n\n\"Explain yourself, my Lord,\" replied the prisoner, with majesty; \"for\nthough I hear your words, I declare I do not understand them.\"\n\n\"Then you have no religion at all; I like that best,\" replied Lord de\nWinter, laughing.\n\n\"Certainly that is most in accord with your own principles,\" replied\nMilady, frigidly.\n\n\"Oh, I confess it is all the same to me.\"\n\n\"Oh, you need not avow this religious indifference, my Lord; your\ndebaucheries and crimes would vouch for it.\"\n\n\"What, you talk of debaucheries, Madame Messalina, Lady Macbeth! Either\nI misunderstand you or you are very shameless!\"\n\n\"You only speak thus because you are overheard,\" coolly replied Milady;\n\"and you wish to interest your jailers and your hangmen against me.\"\n\n\"My jailers and my hangmen! Heyday, madame! you are taking a poetical\ntone, and the comedy of yesterday turns to a tragedy this evening. As to\nthe rest, in eight days you will be where you ought to be, and my task\nwill be completed.\"\n\n\"Infamous task! impious task!\" cried Milady, with the exultation of a\nvictim who provokes his judge.\n\n\"My word,\" said de Winter, rising, \"I think the hussy is going mad!\nCome, come, calm yourself, Madame Puritan, or I'll remove you to a\ndungeon. It's my Spanish wine that has got into your head, is it not?\nBut never mind; that sort of intoxication is not dangerous, and will\nhave no bad effects.\"\n\nAnd Lord de Winter retired swearing, which at that period was a very\nknightly habit.\n\nFelton was indeed behind the door, and had not lost one word of this\nscene. Milady had guessed aright.\n\n\"Yes, go, go!\" said she to her brother; \"the effects ARE drawing near,\non the contrary; but you, weak fool, will not see them until it is too\nlate to shun them.\"\n\nSilence was re-established. Two hours passed away. Milady's supper\nwas brought in, and she was found deeply engaged in saying her prayers\naloud--prayers which she had learned of an old servant of her second\nhusband, a most austere Puritan. She appeared to be in ecstasy, and did\nnot pay the least attention to what was going on around her. Felton made\na sign that she should not be disturbed; and when all was arranged, he\nwent out quietly with the soldiers.\n\nMilady knew she might be watched, so she continued her prayers to the\nend; and it appeared to her that the soldier who was on duty at her door\ndid not march with the same step, and seemed to listen. For the moment\nshe wished nothing better. She arose, came to the table, ate but little,\nand drank only water.\n\nAn hour after, her table was cleared; but Milady remarked that this time\nFelton did not accompany the soldiers. He feared, then, to see her too\noften.\n\nShe turned toward the wall to smile--for there was in this smile such an\nexpression of triumph that this smile alone would have betrayed her.\n\nShe allowed, therefore, half an hour to pass away; and as at that moment\nall was silence in the old castle, as nothing was heard but the eternal\nmurmur of the waves--that immense breaking of the ocean--with her pure,\nharmonious, and powerful voice, she began the first couplet of the psalm\nthen in great favor with the Puritans:\n\n\n\"Thou leavest thy servants, Lord, To see if they be strong; But soon\nthou dost afford Thy hand to lead them on.\"\n\n\nThese verses were not excellent--very far from it; but as it is well\nknown, the Puritans did not pique themselves upon their poetry.\n\nWhile singing, Milady listened. The soldier on guard at her door\nstopped, as if he had been changed into stone. Milady was then able to\njudge of the effect she had produced.\n\nThen she continued her singing with inexpressible fervor and feeling. It\nappeared to her that the sounds spread to a distance beneath the vaulted\nroofs, and carried with them a magic charm to soften the hearts of\nher jailers. It however likewise appeared that the soldier on duty--a\nzealous Catholic, no doubt--shook off the charm, for through the door\nhe called: \"Hold your tongue, madame! Your song is as dismal as a 'De\nprofundis'; and if besides the pleasure of being in garrison here, we\nmust hear such things as these, no mortal can hold out.\"\n\n\"Silence!\" then exclaimed another stern voice which Milady recognized as\nthat of Felton. \"What are you meddling with, stupid? Did anybody order\nyou to prevent that woman from singing? No. You were told to guard\nher--to fire at her if she attempted to fly. Guard her! If she flies,\nkill her; but don't exceed your orders.\"\n\nAn expression of unspeakable joy lightened the countenance of Milady;\nbut this expression was fleeting as the reflection of lightning. Without\nappearing to have heard the dialogue, of which she had not lost a word,\nshe began again, giving to her voice all the charm, all the power, all\nthe seduction the demon had bestowed upon it:\n\n  \"For all my tears, my cares,\n    My exile, and my chains,\n  I have my youth, my prayers,\n    And God, who counts my pains.\"\n\nHer voice, of immense power and sublime expression, gave to the rude,\nunpolished poetry of these psalms a magic and an effect which the most\nexalted Puritans rarely found in the songs of their brethren, and\nwhich they were forced to ornament with all the resources of their\nimagination. Felton believed he heard the singing of the angel who\nconsoled the three Hebrews in the furnace.\n\nMilady continued:\n\n\"One day our doors will ope, With God come our desire; And if betrays\nthat hope, To death we can aspire.\"\n\nThis verse, into which the terrible enchantress threw her whole soul,\ncompleted the trouble which had seized the heart of the young officer.\nHe opened the door quickly; and Milady saw him appear, pale as usual,\nbut with his eye inflamed and almost wild.\n\n\"Why do you sing thus, and with such a voice?\" said he.\n\n\"Your pardon, sir,\" said Milady, with mildness. \"I forgot that my songs\nare out of place in this castle. I have perhaps offended you in your\ncreed; but it was without wishing to do so, I swear. Pardon me, then, a\nfault which is perhaps great, but which certainly was involuntary.\"\n\nMilady was so beautiful at this moment, the religious ecstasy in which\nshe appeared to be plunged gave such an expression to her countenance,\nthat Felton was so dazzled that he fancied he beheld the angel whom he\nhad only just before heard.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said he; \"you disturb, you agitate the people who live in\nthe castle.\"\n\nThe poor, senseless young man was not aware of the incoherence of his\nwords, while Milady was reading with her lynx's eyes the very depths of\nhis heart.\n\n\"I will be silent, then,\" said Milady, casting down her eyes with all\nthe sweetness she could give to her voice, with all the resignation she\ncould impress upon her manner.\n\n\"No, no, madame,\" said Felton, \"only do not sing so loud, particularly\nat night.\"\n\nAnd at these words Felton, feeling that he could not long maintain his\nseverity toward his prisoner, rushed out of the room.\n\n\"You have done right, Lieutenant,\" said the soldier. \"Such songs\ndisturb the mind; and yet we become accustomed to them, her voice is so\nbeautiful.\"\n\n\n\n\n54 CAPTIVITY: THE THIRD DAY\n\nFelton had fallen; but there was still another step to be taken. He\nmust be retained, or rather he must be left quite alone; and Milady but\nobscurely perceived the means which could lead to this result.\n\nStill more must be done. He must be made to speak, in order that\nhe might be spoken to--for Milady very well knew that her greatest\nseduction was in her voice, which so skillfully ran over the whole gamut\nof tones from human speech to language celestial.\n\nYet in spite of all this seduction Milady might fail--for Felton was\nforewarned, and that against the least chance. From that moment she\nwatched all his actions, all his words, from the simplest glance of his\neyes to his gestures--even to a breath that could be interpreted as a\nsigh. In short, she studied everything, as a skillful comedian does\nto whom a new part has been assigned in a line to which he is not\naccustomed.\n\nFace to face with Lord de Winter her plan of conduct was more easy. She\nhad laid that down the preceding evening. To remain silent and dignified\nin his presence; from time to time to irritate him by affected disdain,\nby a contemptuous word; to provoke him to threats and violence which\nwould produce a contrast with her own resignation--such was her plan.\nFelton would see all; perhaps he would say nothing, but he would see.\n\nIn the morning, Felton came as usual; but Milady allowed him to preside\nover all the preparations for breakfast without addressing a word to\nhim. At the moment when he was about to retire, she was cheered with a\nray of hope, for she thought he was about to speak; but his lips moved\nwithout any sound leaving his mouth, and making a powerful effort to\ncontrol himself, he sent back to his heart the words that were about\nto escape from his lips, and went out. Toward midday, Lord de Winter\nentered.\n\nIt was a tolerably fine winter's day, and a ray of that pale English sun\nwhich lights but does not warm came through the bars of her prison.\n\nMilady was looking out at the window, and pretended not to hear the door\nas it opened.\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" said Lord de Winter, \"after having played comedy, after having\nplayed tragedy, we are now playing melancholy?\"\n\nThe prisoner made no reply.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" continued Lord de Winter, \"I understand. You would like very\nwell to be at liberty on that beach! You would like very well to be in\na good ship dancing upon the waves of that emerald-green sea; you would\nlike very well, either on land or on the ocean, to lay for me one of\nthose nice little ambuscades you are so skillful in planning. Patience,\npatience! In four days' time the shore will be beneath your feet, the\nsea will be open to you--more open than will perhaps be agreeable to\nyou, for in four days England will be relieved of you.\"\n\nMilady folded her hands, and raising her fine eyes toward heaven, \"Lord,\nLord,\" said she, with an angelic meekness of gesture and tone, \"pardon\nthis man, as I myself pardon him.\"\n\n\"Yes, pray, accursed woman!\" cried the baron; \"your prayer is so much\nthe more generous from your being, I swear to you, in the power of a man\nwho will never pardon you!\" and he went out.\n\nAt the moment he went out a piercing glance darted through the opening\nof the nearly closed door, and she perceived Felton, who drew quickly to\none side to prevent being seen by her.\n\nThen she threw herself upon her knees, and began to pray.\n\n\"My God, my God!\" said she, \"thou knowest in what holy cause I suffer;\ngive me, then, strength to suffer.\"\n\nThe door opened gently; the beautiful supplicant pretended not to hear\nthe noise, and in a voice broken by tears, she continued:\n\n\"God of vengeance! God of goodness! wilt thou allow the frightful\nprojects of this man to be accomplished?\"\n\nThen only she pretended to hear the sound of Felton's steps, and rising\nquick as thought, she blushed, as if ashamed of being surprised on her\nknees.\n\n\"I do not like to disturb those who pray, madame,\" said Felton,\nseriously; \"do not disturb yourself on my account, I beseech you.\"\n\n\"How do you know I was praying, sir?\" said Milady, in a voice broken by\nsobs. \"You were deceived, sir; I was not praying.\"\n\n\"Do you think, then, madame,\" replied Felton, in the same serious voice,\nbut with a milder tone, \"do you think I assume the right of preventing\na creature from prostrating herself before her Creator? God forbid!\nBesides, repentance becomes the guilty; whatever crimes they may have\ncommitted, for me the guilty are sacred at the feet of God!\"\n\n\"Guilty? I?\" said Milady, with a smile which might have disarmed the\nangel of the last judgment. \"Guilty? Oh, my God, thou knowest whether\nI am guilty! Say I am condemned, sir, if you please; but you know that\nGod, who loves martyrs, sometimes permits the innocent to be condemned.\"\n\n\"Were you condemned, were you innocent, were you a martyr,\" replied\nFelton, \"the greater would be the necessity for prayer; and I myself\nwould aid you with my prayers.\"\n\n\"Oh, you are a just man!\" cried Milady, throwing herself at his feet. \"I\ncan hold out no longer, for I fear I shall be wanting in strength at the\nmoment when I shall be forced to undergo the struggle, and confess my\nfaith. Listen, then, to the supplication of a despairing woman. You are\nabused, sir; but that is not the question. I only ask you one favor; and\nif you grant it me, I will bless you in this world and in the next.\"\n\n\"Speak to the master, madame,\" said Felton; \"happily I am neither\ncharged with the power of pardoning nor punishing. It is upon one higher\nplaced than I am that God has laid this responsibility.\"\n\n\"To you--no, to you alone! Listen to me, rather than add to my\ndestruction, rather than add to my ignominy!\"\n\n\"If you have merited this shame, madame, if you have incurred this\nignominy, you must submit to it as an offering to God.\"\n\n\"What do you say? Oh, you do not understand me! When I speak of\nignominy, you think I speak of some chastisement, of imprisonment or\ndeath. Would to heaven! Of what consequence to me is imprisonment or\ndeath?\"\n\n\"It is I who no longer understand you, madame,\" said Felton.\n\n\"Or, rather, who pretend not to understand me, sir!\" replied the\nprisoner, with a smile of incredulity.\n\n\"No, madame, on the honor of a soldier, on the faith of a Christian.\"\n\n\"What, you are ignorant of Lord de Winter's designs upon me?\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"Impossible; you are his confidant!\"\n\n\"I never lie, madame.\"\n\n\"Oh, he conceals them too little for you not to divine them.\"\n\n\"I seek to divine nothing, madame; I wait till I am confided in, and\napart from that which Lord de Winter has said to me before you, he has\nconfided nothing to me.\"\n\n\"Why, then,\" cried Milady, with an incredible tone of truthfulness,\n\"you are not his accomplice; you do not know that he destines me to a\ndisgrace which all the punishments of the world cannot equal in horror?\"\n\n\"You are deceived, madame,\" said Felton, blushing; \"Lord de Winter is\nnot capable of such a crime.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Milady to herself; \"without thinking what it is, he calls\nit a crime!\" Then aloud, \"The friend of THAT WRETCH is capable of\neverything.\"\n\n\"Whom do you call 'that wretch'?\" asked Felton.\n\n\"Are there, then, in England two men to whom such an epithet can be\napplied?\"\n\n\"You mean George Villiers?\" asked Felton, whose looks became excited.\n\n\"Whom Pagans and unbelieving Gentiles call Duke of Buckingham,\" replied\nMilady. \"I could not have thought that there was an Englishman in all\nEngland who would have required so long an explanation to make him\nunderstand of whom I was speaking.\"\n\n\"The hand of the Lord is stretched over him,\" said Felton; \"he will not\nescape the chastisement he deserves.\"\n\nFelton only expressed, with regard to the duke, the feeling of\nexecration which all the English had declared toward him whom the\nCatholics themselves called the extortioner, the pillager, the\ndebauchee, and whom the Puritans styled simply Satan.\n\n\"Oh, my God, my God!\" cried Milady; \"when I supplicate thee to pour upon\nthis man the chastisement which is his due, thou knowest it is not my\nown vengeance I pursue, but the deliverance of a whole nation that I\nimplore!\"\n\n\"Do you know him, then?\" asked Felton.\n\n\"At length he interrogates me!\" said Milady to herself, at the height\nof joy at having obtained so quickly such a great result. \"Oh, know\nhim? Yes, yes! to my misfortune, to my eternal misfortune!\" and Milady\ntwisted her arms as if in a paroxysm of grief.\n\nFelton no doubt felt within himself that his strength was abandoning\nhim, and he made several steps toward the door; but the prisoner, whose\neye never left him, sprang in pursuit of him and stopped him.\n\n\"Sir,\" cried she, \"be kind, be clement, listen to my prayer! That knife,\nwhich the fatal prudence of the baron deprived me of, because he knows\nthe use I would make of it! Oh, hear me to the end! that knife, give it\nto me for a minute only, for mercy's, for pity's sake! I will\nembrace your knees! You shall shut the door that you may be certain I\ncontemplate no injury to you! My God! to you--the only just, good, and\ncompassionate being I have met with! To you--my preserver, perhaps! One\nminute that knife, one minute, a single minute, and I will restore it\nto you through the grating of the door. Only one minute, Mr. Felton, and\nyou will have saved my honor!\"\n\n\"To kill yourself?\" cried Felton, with terror, forgetting to withdraw\nhis hands from the hands of the prisoner, \"to kill yourself?\"\n\n\"I have told, sir,\" murmured Milady, lowering her voice, and allowing\nherself to sink overpowered to the ground; \"I have told my secret! He\nknows all! My God, I am lost!\"\n\nFelton remained standing, motionless and undecided.\n\n\"He still doubts,\" thought Milady; \"I have not been earnest enough.\"\n\nSomeone was heard in the corridor; Milady recognized the step of Lord de\nWinter.\n\nFelton recognized it also, and made a step toward the door.\n\nMilady sprang toward him. \"Oh, not a word,\" said she in a concentrated\nvoice, \"not a word of all that I have said to you to this man, or I am\nlost, and it would be you--you--\"\n\nThen as the steps drew near, she became silent for fear of being heard,\napplying, with a gesture of infinite terror, her beautiful hand to\nFelton's mouth.\n\nFelton gently repulsed Milady, and she sank into a chair.\n\nLord de Winter passed before the door without stopping, and they heard\nthe noise of his footsteps soon die away.\n\nFelton, as pale as death, remained some instants with his ear bent and\nlistening; then, when the sound was quite extinct, he breathed like a\nman awaking from a dream, and rushed out of the apartment.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Milady, listening in her turn to the noise of Felton's steps,\nwhich withdrew in a direction opposite to those of Lord de Winter; \"at\nlength you are mine!\"\n\nThen her brow darkened. \"If he tells the baron,\" said she, \"I am\nlost--for the baron, who knows very well that I shall not kill myself,\nwill place me before him with a knife in my hand, and he will discover\nthat all this despair is but acted.\"\n\nShe placed herself before the glass, and regarded herself attentively;\nnever had she appeared more beautiful.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said she, smiling, \"but we won't tell him!\"\n\nIn the evening Lord de Winter accompanied the supper.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Milady, \"is your presence an indispensable accessory of my\ncaptivity? Could you not spare me the increase of torture which your\nvisits cause me?\"\n\n\"How, dear sister!\" said Lord de Winter. \"Did not you sentimentally\ninform me with that pretty mouth of yours, so cruel to me today, that\nyou came to England solely for the pleasure of seeing me at your ease,\nan enjoyment of which you told me you so sensibly felt the deprivation\nthat you had risked everything for it--seasickness, tempest, captivity?\nWell, here I am; be satisfied. Besides, this time, my visit has a\nmotive.\"\n\nMilady trembled; she thought Felton had told all. Perhaps never in her\nlife had this woman, who had experienced so many opposite and powerful\nemotions, felt her heart beat so violently.\n\nShe was seated. Lord de Winter took a chair, drew it toward her, and\nsat down close beside her. Then taking a paper out of his pocket, he\nunfolded it slowly.\n\n\"Here,\" said he, \"I want to show you the kind of passport which I have\ndrawn up, and which will serve you henceforward as the rule of order in\nthe life I consent to leave you.\"\n\nThen turning his eyes from Milady to the paper, he read: \"'Order to\nconduct--' The name is blank,\" interrupted Lord de Winter. \"If you have\nany preference you can point it out to me; and if it be not within a\nthousand leagues of London, attention will be paid to your wishes. I\nwill begin again, then:\n\n\"'Order to conduct to--the person named Charlotte Backson, branded by\nthe justice of the kingdom of France, but liberated after chastisement.\nShe is to dwell in this place without ever going more than three leagues\nfrom it. In case of any attempt to escape, the penalty of death is to be\napplied. She will receive five shillings per day for lodging and food'\".\n\n\"That order does not concern me,\" replied Milady, coldly, \"since it\nbears another name than mine.\"\n\n\"A name? Have you a name, then?\"\n\n\"I bear that of your brother.\"\n\n\"Ay, but you are mistaken. My brother is only your second husband; and\nyour first is still living. Tell me his name, and I will put it in\nthe place of the name of Charlotte Backson. No? You will not? You are\nsilent? Well, then you must be registered as Charlotte Backson.\"\n\nMilady remained silent; only this time it was no longer from\naffectation, but from terror. She believed the order ready for\nexecution. She thought that Lord de Winter had hastened her departure;\nshe thought she was condemned to set off that very evening. Everything\nin her mind was lost for an instant; when all at once she perceived\nthat no signature was attached to the order. The joy she felt at this\ndiscovery was so great she could not conceal it.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Lord de Winter, who perceived what was passing in her\nmind; \"yes, you look for the signature, and you say to yourself: 'All\nis not lost, for that order is not signed. It is only shown to me to\nterrify me, that's all.' You are mistaken. Tomorrow this order will be\nsent to the Duke of Buckingham. The day after tomorrow it will return\nsigned by his hand and marked with his seal; and four-and-twenty hours\nafterward I will answer for its being carried into execution. Adieu,\nmadame. That is all I had to say to you.\"\n\n\"And I reply to you, sir, that this abuse of power, this exile under a\nfictitious name, are infamous!\"\n\n\"Would you like better to be hanged in your true name, Milady? You know\nthat the English laws are inexorable on the abuse of marriage. Speak\nfreely. Although my name, or rather that of my brother, would be mixed\nup with the affair, I will risk the scandal of a public trial to make\nmyself certain of getting rid of you.\"\n\nMilady made no reply, but became as pale as a corpse.\n\n\"Oh, I see you prefer peregrination. That's well madame; and there is an\nold proverb that says, 'Traveling trains youth.' My faith! you are not\nwrong after all, and life is sweet. That's the reason why I take such\ncare you shall not deprive me of mine. There only remains, then, the\nquestion of the five shillings to be settled. You think me rather\nparsimonious, don't you? That's because I don't care to leave you the\nmeans of corrupting your jailers. Besides, you will always have your\ncharms left to seduce them with. Employ them, if your check with regard\nto Felton has not disgusted you with attempts of that kind.\"\n\n\"Felton has not told him,\" said Milady to herself. \"Nothing is lost,\nthen.\"\n\n\"And now, madame, till I see you again! Tomorrow I will come and\nannounce to you the departure of my messenger.\"\n\nLord de Winter rose, saluted her ironically, and went out.\n\nMilady breathed again. She had still four days before her. Four days\nwould quite suffice to complete the seduction of Felton.\n\nA terrible idea, however, rushed into her mind. She thought that Lord de\nWinter would perhaps send Felton himself to get the order signed by the\nDuke of Buckingham. In that case Felton would escape her--for in order\nto secure success, the magic of a continuous seduction was necessary.\nNevertheless, as we have said, one circumstance reassured her. Felton\nhad not spoken.\n\nAs she would not appear to be agitated by the threats of Lord de Winter,\nshe placed herself at the table and ate.\n\nThen, as she had done the evening before, she fell on her knees and\nrepeated her prayers aloud. As on the evening before, the soldier\nstopped his march to listen to her.\n\nSoon after she heard lighter steps than those of the sentinel, which\ncame from the end of the corridor and stopped before her door.\n\n\"It is he,\" said she. And she began the same religious chant which had\nso strongly excited Felton the evening before.\n\nBut although her voice--sweet, full, and sonorous--vibrated as\nharmoniously and as affectingly as ever, the door remained shut. It\nappeared however to Milady that in one of the furtive glances she darted\nfrom time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw the\nardent eyes of the young man through the narrow opening. But whether\nthis was reality or vision, he had this time sufficient self-command not\nto enter.\n\nHowever, a few instants after she had finished her religious song,\nMilady thought she heard a profound sigh. Then the same steps she had\nheard approach slowly withdrew, as if with regret.\n\n\n\n\n55 CAPTIVITY: THE FOURTH DAY\n\nThe next day, when Felton entered Milady's apartment he found her\nstanding, mounted upon a chair, holding in her hands a cord made by\nmeans of torn cambric handkerchiefs, twisted into a kind of rope\none with another, and tied at the ends. At the noise Felton made in\nentering, Milady leaped lightly to the ground, and tried to conceal\nbehind her the improvised cord she held in her hand.\n\nThe young man was more pale than usual, and his eyes, reddened by want\nof sleep, denoted that he had passed a feverish night. Nevertheless, his\nbrow was armed with a severity more austere than ever.\n\nHe advanced slowly toward Milady, who had seated herself, and taking an\nend of the murderous rope which by neglect, or perhaps by design, she\nallowed to be seen, \"What is this, madame?\" he asked coldly.\n\n\"That? Nothing,\" said Milady, smiling with that painful expression which\nshe knew so well how to give to her smile. \"Ennui is the mortal enemy of\nprisoners; I had ennui, and I amused myself with twisting that rope.\"\n\nFelton turned his eyes toward the part of the wall of the apartment\nbefore which he had found Milady standing in the armchair in which she\nwas now seated, and over her head he perceived a gilt-headed screw,\nfixed in the wall for the purpose of hanging up clothes or weapons.\n\nHe started, and the prisoner saw that start--for though her eyes were\ncast down, nothing escaped her.\n\n\"What were you doing on that armchair?\" asked he.\n\n\"Of what consequence?\" replied Milady.\n\n\"But,\" replied Felton, \"I wish to know.\"\n\n\"Do not question me,\" said the prisoner; \"you know that we who are true\nChristians are forbidden to lie.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Felton, \"I will tell you what you were doing, or\nrather what you meant to do; you were going to complete the fatal\nproject you cherish in your mind. Remember, madame, if our God forbids\nfalsehood, he much more severely condemns suicide.\"\n\n\"When God sees one of his creatures persecuted unjustly, placed between\nsuicide and dishonor, believe me, sir,\" replied Milady, in a tone\nof deep conviction, \"God pardons suicide, for then suicide becomes\nmartyrdom.\"\n\n\"You say either too much or too little; speak, madame. In the name of\nheaven, explain yourself.\"\n\n\"That I may relate my misfortunes for you to treat them as fables;\nthat I may tell you my projects for you to go and betray them to my\npersecutor? No, sir. Besides, of what importance to you is the life or\ndeath of a condemned wretch? You are only responsible for my body, is\nit not so? And provided you produce a carcass that may be recognized as\nmine, they will require no more of you; nay, perhaps you will even have\na double reward.\"\n\n\"I, madame, I?\" cried Felton. \"You suppose that I would ever accept the\nprice of your life? Oh, you cannot believe what you say!\"\n\n\"Let me act as I please, Felton, let me act as I please,\" said Milady,\nelated. \"Every soldier must be ambitious, must he not? You are a\nlieutenant? Well, you will follow me to the grave with the rank of\ncaptain.\"\n\n\"What have I, then, done to you,\" said Felton, much agitated, \"that you\nshould load me with such a responsibility before God and before men?\nIn a few days you will be away from this place; your life, madame, will\nthen no longer be under my care, and,\" added he, with a sigh, \"then you\ncan do what you will with it.\"\n\n\"So,\" cried Milady, as if she could not resist giving utterance to a\nholy indignation, \"you, a pious man, you who are called a just man, you\nask but one thing--and that is that you may not be inculpated, annoyed,\nby my death!\"\n\n\"It is my duty to watch over your life, madame, and I will watch.\"\n\n\"But do you understand the mission you are fulfilling? Cruel enough, if\nI am guilty; but what name can you give it, what name will the Lord give\nit, if I am innocent?\"\n\n\"I am a soldier, madame, and fulfill the orders I have received.\"\n\n\"Do you believe, then, that at the day of the Last Judgment God will\nseparate blind executioners from iniquitous judges? You are not willing\nthat I should kill my body, and you make yourself the agent of him who\nwould kill my soul.\"\n\n\"But I repeat it again to you,\" replied Felton, in great emotion, \"no\ndanger threatens you; I will answer for Lord de Winter as for myself.\"\n\n\"Dunce,\" cried Milady, \"dunce! who dares to answer for another man, when\nthe wisest, when those most after God's own heart, hesitate to answer\nfor themselves, and who ranges himself on the side of the strongest and\nthe most fortunate, to crush the weakest and the most unfortunate.\"\n\n\"Impossible, madame, impossible,\" murmured Felton, who felt to the\nbottom of his heart the justness of this argument. \"A prisoner, you will\nnot recover your liberty through me; living, you will not lose your life\nthrough me.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" cried Milady, \"but I shall lose that which is much dearer to me\nthan life, I shall lose my honor, Felton; and it is you, you whom I make\nresponsible, before God and before men, for my shame and my infamy.\"\n\nThis time Felton, immovable as he was, or appeared to be, could not\nresist the secret influence which had already taken possession of him.\nTo see this woman, so beautiful, fair as the brightest vision, to see\nher by turns overcome with grief and threatening; to resist at once the\nascendancy of grief and beauty--it was too much for a visionary; it was\ntoo much for a brain weakened by the ardent dreams of an ecstatic faith;\nit was too much for a heart furrowed by the love of heaven that burns,\nby the hatred of men that devours.\n\nMilady saw the trouble. She felt by intuition the flame of the opposing\npassions which burned with the blood in the veins of the young fanatic.\nAs a skillful general, seeing the enemy ready to surrender, marches\ntoward him with a cry of victory, she rose, beautiful as an antique\npriestess, inspired like a Christian virgin, her arms extended, her\nthroat uncovered, her hair disheveled, holding with one hand her robe\nmodestly drawn over her breast, her look illumined by that fire which\nhad already created such disorder in the veins of the young Puritan, and\nwent toward him, crying out with a vehement air, and in her melodious\nvoice, to which on this occasion she communicated a terrible energy:\n\n\n\"Let this victim to Baal be sent, To the lions the martyr be thrown!\nThy God shall teach thee to repent! From th' abyss he'll give ear to my\nmoan.\"\n\n\nFelton stood before this strange apparition like one petrified.\n\n\"Who art thou? Who art thou?\" cried he, clasping his hands. \"Art thou a\nmessenger from God; art thou a minister from hell; art thou an angel or\na demon; callest thou thyself Eloa or Astarte?\"\n\n\"Do you not know me, Felton? I am neither an angel nor a demon; I am a\ndaughter of earth, I am a sister of thy faith, that is all.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" said Felton, \"I doubted, but now I believe.\"\n\n\"You believe, and still you are an accomplice of that child of Belial\nwho is called Lord de Winter! You believe, and yet you leave me in the\nhands of mine enemies, of the enemy of England, of the enemy of God!\nYou believe, and yet you deliver me up to him who fills and defiles the\nworld with his heresies and debaucheries--to that infamous Sardanapalus\nwhom the blind call the Duke of Buckingham, and whom believers name\nAntichrist!\"\n\n\"I deliver you up to Buckingham? I? what mean you by that?\"\n\n\"They have eyes,\" cried Milady, \"but they see not; ears have they, but\nthey hear not.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" said Felton, passing his hands over his brow, covered with\nsweat, as if to remove his last doubt. \"Yes, I recognize the voice which\nspeaks to me in my dreams; yes, I recognize the features of the angel\nwho appears to me every night, crying to my soul, which cannot sleep:\n'Strike, save England, save thyself--for thou wilt die without having\nappeased God!' Speak, speak!\" cried Felton, \"I can understand you now.\"\n\nA flash of terrible joy, but rapid as thought, gleamed from the eyes of\nMilady.\n\nHowever fugitive this homicide flash, Felton saw it, and started as if\nits light had revealed the abysses of this woman's heart. He recalled,\nall at once, the warnings of Lord de Winter, the seductions of Milady,\nher first attempts after her arrival. He drew back a step, and hung down\nhis head, without, however, ceasing to look at her, as if, fascinated by\nthis strange creature, he could not detach his eyes from her eyes.\n\nMilady was not a woman to misunderstand the meaning of this hesitation.\nUnder her apparent emotions her icy coolness never abandoned her.\nBefore Felton replied, and before she should be forced to resume this\nconversation, so difficult to be sustained in the same exalted tone, she\nlet her hands fall; and as if the weakness of the woman overpowered the\nenthusiasm of the inspired fanatic, she said: \"But no, it is not for me\nto be the Judith to deliver Bethulia from this Holofernes. The sword of\nthe eternal is too heavy for my arm. Allow me, then, to avoid dishonor\nby death; let me take refuge in martyrdom. I do not ask you for liberty,\nas a guilty one would, nor for vengeance, as would a pagan. Let me die;\nthat is all. I supplicate you, I implore you on my knees--let me die,\nand my last sigh shall be a blessing for my preserver.\"\n\nHearing that voice, so sweet and suppliant, seeing that look, so timid\nand downcast, Felton reproached himself. By degrees the enchantress had\nclothed herself with that magic adornment which she assumed and threw\naside at will; that is to say, beauty, meekness, and tears--and above\nall, the irresistible attraction of mystical voluptuousness, the most\ndevouring of all voluptuousness.\n\n\"Alas!\" said Felton, \"I can do but one thing, which is to pity you\nif you prove to me you are a victim! But Lord de Winter makes cruel\naccusations against you. You are a Christian; you are my sister in\nreligion. I feel myself drawn toward you--I, who have never loved anyone\nbut my benefactor--I who have met with nothing but traitors and\nimpious men. But you, madame, so beautiful in reality, you, so pure in\nappearance, must have committed great iniquities for Lord de Winter to\npursue you thus.\"\n\n\"They have eyes,\" repeated Milady, with an accent of indescribable\ngrief, \"but they see not; ears have they, but they hear not.\"\n\n\"But,\" cried the young officer, \"speak, then, speak!\"\n\n\"Confide my shame to you,\" cried Milady, with the blush of modesty\nupon her countenance, \"for often the crime of one becomes the shame of\nanother--confide my shame to you, a man, and I a woman? Oh,\" continued\nshe, placing her hand modestly over her beautiful eyes, \"never!\nnever!--I could not!\"\n\n\"To me, to a brother?\" said Felton.\n\nMilady looked at him for some time with an expression which the young\nman took for doubt, but which, however, was nothing but observation, or\nrather the wish to fascinate.\n\nFelton, in his turn a suppliant, clasped his hands.\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Milady, \"I confide in my brother; I will dare to--\"\n\nAt this moment the steps of Lord de Winter were heard; but this time\nthe terrible brother-in-law of Milady did not content himself, as on\nthe preceding day, with passing before the door and going away again. He\npaused, exchanged two words with the sentinel; then the door opened, and\nhe appeared.\n\nDuring the exchange of these two words Felton drew back quickly, and\nwhen Lord de Winter entered, he was several paces from the prisoner.\n\nThe baron entered slowly, sending a scrutinizing glance from Milady to\nthe young officer.\n\n\"You have been here a very long time, John,\" said he. \"Has this woman\nbeen relating her crimes to you? In that case I can comprehend the\nlength of the conversation.\"\n\nFelton started; and Milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the\nassistance of the disconcerted Puritan.\n\n\"Ah, you fear your prisoner should escape!\" said she. \"Well, ask your\nworthy jailer what favor I this instant solicited of him.\"\n\n\"You demanded a favor?\" said the baron, suspiciously.\n\n\"Yes, my Lord,\" replied the young man, confused.\n\n\"And what favor, pray?\" asked Lord de Winter.\n\n\"A knife, which she would return to me through the grating of the door a\nminute after she had received it,\" replied Felton.\n\n\"There is someone, then, concealed here whose throat this amiable lady\nis desirous of cutting,\" said de Winter, in an ironical, contemptuous\ntone.\n\n\"There is myself,\" replied Milady.\n\n\"I have given you the choice between America and Tyburn,\" replied Lord\nde Winter. \"Choose Tyburn, madame. Believe me, the cord is more certain\nthan the knife.\"\n\nFelton grew pale, and made a step forward, remembering that at the\nmoment he entered Milady had a rope in her hand.\n\n\"You are right,\" said she, \"I have often thought of it.\" Then she added\nin a low voice, \"And I will think of it again.\"\n\nFelton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones; probably Lord de\nWinter perceived this emotion.\n\n\"Mistrust yourself, John,\" said he. \"I have placed reliance upon you,\nmy friend. Beware! I have warned you! But be of good courage, my lad; in\nthree days we shall be delivered from this creature, and where I shall\nsend her she can harm nobody.\"\n\n\"You hear him!\" cried Milady, with vehemence, so that the baron might\nbelieve she was addressing heaven, and that Felton might understand she\nwas addressing him.\n\nFelton lowered his head and reflected.\n\nThe baron took the young officer by the arm, and turned his head over\nhis shoulder, so as not to lose sight of Milady till he was gone out.\n\n\"Well,\" said the prisoner, when the door was shut, \"I am not so far\nadvanced as I believed. De Winter has changed his usual stupidity into a\nstrange prudence. It is the desire of vengeance, and how desire molds\na man! As to Felton, he hesitates. Ah, he is not a man like that\ncursed d'Artagnan. A Puritan only adores virgins, and he adores them\nby clasping his hands. A Musketeer loves women, and he loves them by\nclasping his arms round them.\"\n\nMilady waited, then, with much impatience, for she feared the day would\npass away without her seeing Felton again. At last, in an hour after the\nscene we have just described, she heard someone speaking in a low voice\nat the door. Presently the door opened, and she perceived Felton.\n\nThe young man advanced rapidly into the chamber, leaving the door open\nbehind him, and making a sign to Milady to be silent; his face was much\nagitated.\n\n\"What do you want with me?\" said she.\n\n\"Listen,\" replied Felton, in a low voice. \"I have just sent away the\nsentinel that I might remain here without anybody knowing it, in order\nto speak to you without being overheard. The baron has just related a\nfrightful story to me.\"\n\nMilady assumed her smile of a resigned victim, and shook her head.\n\n\"Either you are a demon,\" continued Felton, \"or the baron--my\nbenefactor, my father--is a monster. I have known you four days; I\nhave loved him four years. I therefore may hesitate between you. Be not\nalarmed at what I say; I want to be convinced. Tonight, after twelve, I\nwill come and see you, and you shall convince me.\"\n\n\"No, Felton, no, my brother,\" said she; \"the sacrifice is too great, and\nI feel what it must cost you. No, I am lost; do not be lost with me. My\ndeath will be much more eloquent than my life, and the silence of the\ncorpse will convince you much better than the words of the prisoner.\"\n\n\"Be silent, madame,\" cried Felton, \"and do not speak to me thus; I came\nto entreat you to promise me upon your honor, to swear to me by what you\nhold most sacred, that you will make no attempt upon your life.\"\n\n\"I will not promise,\" said Milady, \"for no one has more respect for a\npromise or an oath than I have; and if I make a promise I must keep it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Felton, \"only promise till you have seen me again. If, when\nyou have seen me again, you still persist--well, then you shall be free,\nand I myself will give you the weapon you desire.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Milady, \"for you I will wait.\"\n\n\"Swear.\"\n\n\"I swear it, by our God. Are you satisfied?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Felton, \"till tonight.\"\n\nAnd he darted out of the room, shut the door, and waited in the\ncorridor, the soldier's half-pike in his hand, and as if he had mounted\nguard in his place.\n\nThe soldier returned, and Felton gave him back his weapon.\n\nThen, through the grating to which she had drawn near, Milady saw the\nyoung man make a sign with delirious fervor, and depart in an apparent\ntransport of joy.\n\nAs for her, she returned to her place with a smile of savage contempt\nupon her lips, and repeated, blaspheming, that terrible name of God, by\nwhom she had just sworn without ever having learned to know Him.\n\n\"My God,\" said she, \"what a senseless fanatic! My God, it is I--I--and\nthis fellow who will help me to avenge myself.\"\n\n\n\n\n56 CAPTIVITY: THE FIFTH DAY\n\nMilady had however achieved a half-triumph, and success doubled her\nforces.\n\nIt was not difficult to conquer, as she had hitherto done, men prompt to\nlet themselves be seduced, and whom the gallant education of a court\nled quickly into her net. Milady was handsome enough not to find much\nresistance on the part of the flesh, and she was sufficiently skillful\nto prevail over all the obstacles of the mind.\n\nBut this time she had to contend with an unpolished nature, concentrated\nand insensible by force of austerity. Religion and its observances had\nmade Felton a man inaccessible to ordinary seductions. There fermented\nin that sublimated brain plans so vast, projects so tumultuous, that\nthere remained no room for any capricious or material love--that\nsentiment which is fed by leisure and grows with corruption. Milady had,\nthen, made a breach by her false virtue in the opinion of a man horribly\nprejudiced against her, and by her beauty in the heart of a man hitherto\nchaste and pure. In short, she had taken the measure of motives\nhitherto unknown to herself, through this experiment, made upon the most\nrebellious subject that nature and religion could submit to her study.\n\nMany a time, nevertheless, during the evening she despaired of fate and\nof herself. She did not invoke God, we very well know, but she had faith\nin the genius of evil--that immense sovereignty which reigns in all the\ndetails of human life, and by which, as in the Arabian fable, a single\npomegranate seed is sufficient to reconstruct a ruined world.\n\nMilady, being well prepared for the reception of Felton, was able to\nerect her batteries for the next day. She knew she had only two days\nleft; that when once the order was signed by Buckingham--and Buckingham\nwould sign it the more readily from its bearing a false name, and he\ncould not, therefore, recognize the woman in question--once this order\nwas signed, we say, the baron would make her embark immediately, and\nshe knew very well that women condemned to exile employ arms much less\npowerful in their seductions than the pretendedly virtuous woman whose\nbeauty is lighted by the sun of the world, whose style the voice of\nfashion lauds, and whom a halo of aristocracy gilds with enchanting\nsplendors. To be a woman condemned to a painful and disgraceful\npunishment is no impediment to beauty, but it is an obstacle to the\nrecovery of power. Like all persons of real genius, Milady knew\nwhat suited her nature and her means. Poverty was repugnant to her;\ndegradation took away two-thirds of her greatness. Milady was only a\nqueen while among queens. The pleasure of satisfied pride was necessary\nto her domination. To command inferior beings was rather a humiliation\nthan a pleasure for her.\n\nShe should certainly return from her exile--she did not doubt that\na single instant; but how long might this exile last? For an active,\nambitious nature, like that of Milady, days not spent in climbing are\ninauspicious days. What word, then, can be found to describe the days\nwhich they occupy in descending? To lose a year, two years, three years,\nis to talk of an eternity; to return after the death or disgrace of the\ncardinal, perhaps; to return when d'Artagnan and his friends, happy and\ntriumphant, should have received from the queen the reward they had well\nacquired by the services they had rendered her--these were devouring\nideas that a woman like Milady could not endure. For the rest, the storm\nwhich raged within her doubled her strength, and she would have burst\nthe walls of her prison if her body had been able to take for a single\ninstant the proportions of her mind.\n\nThen that which spurred her on additionally in the midst of all this was\nthe remembrance of the cardinal. What must the mistrustful, restless,\nsuspicious cardinal think of her silence--the cardinal, not merely her\nonly support, her only prop, her only protector at present, but still\nfurther, the principal instrument of her future fortune and vengeance?\nShe knew him; she knew that at her return from a fruitless journey it\nwould be in vain to tell him of her imprisonment, in vain to enlarge\nupon the sufferings she had undergone. The cardinal would reply, with\nthe sarcastic calmness of the skeptic, strong at once by power and\ngenius, \"You should not have allowed yourself to be taken.\"\n\nThen Milady collected all her energies, murmuring in the depths of her\nsoul the name of Felton--the only beam of light that penetrated to her\nin the hell into which she had fallen; and like a serpent which folds\nand unfolds its rings to ascertain its strength, she enveloped Felton\nbeforehand in the thousand meshes of her inventive imagination.\n\nTime, however, passed away; the hours, one after another, seemed to\nawaken the clock as they passed, and every blow of the brass hammer\nresounded upon the heart of the prisoner. At nine o'clock, Lord de\nWinter made his customary visit, examined the window and the bars,\nsounded the floor and the walls, looked to the chimney and the\ndoors, without, during this long and minute examination, he or Milady\npronouncing a single word.\n\nDoubtless both of them understood that the situation had become too\nserious to lose time in useless words and aimless wrath.\n\n\"Well,\" said the baron, on leaving her \"you will not escape tonight!\"\n\nAt ten o'clock Felton came and placed the sentinel. Milady recognized\nhis step. She was as well acquainted with it now as a mistress is with\nthat of the lover of her heart; and yet Milady at the same time detested\nand despised this weak fanatic.\n\nThat was not the appointed hour. Felton did not enter.\n\nTwo hours after, as midnight sounded, the sentinel was relieved.\nThis time it WAS the hour, and from this moment Milady waited with\nimpatience. The new sentinel commenced his walk in the corridor. At the\nexpiration of ten minutes Felton came.\n\nMilady was all attention.\n\n\"Listen,\" said the young man to the sentinel. \"On no pretense leave the\ndoor, for you know that last night my Lord punished a soldier for having\nquit his post for an instant, although I, during his absence, watched in\nhis place.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know it,\" said the soldier.\n\n\"I recommend you therefore to keep the strictest watch. For my part I\nam going to pay a second visit to this woman, who I fear entertains\nsinister intentions upon her own life, and I have received orders to\nwatch her.\"\n\n\"Good!\" murmured Milady; \"the austere Puritan lies.\"\n\nAs to the soldier, he only smiled.\n\n\"Zounds, Lieutenant!\" said he; \"you are not unlucky in being charged\nwith such commissions, particularly if my Lord has authorized you to\nlook into her bed.\"\n\nFelton blushed. Under any other circumstances he would have reprimanded\nthe soldier for indulging in such pleasantry, but his conscience\nmurmured too loud for his mouth to dare speak.\n\n\"If I call, come,\" said he. \"If anyone comes, call me.\"\n\n\"I will, Lieutenant,\" said the soldier.\n\nFelton entered Milady's apartment. Milady arose.\n\n\"You are here!\" said she.\n\n\"I promised to come,\" said Felton, \"and I have come.\"\n\n\"You promised me something else.\"\n\n\"What, my God!\" said the young man, who in spite of his self-command\nfelt his knees tremble and the sweat start from his brow.\n\n\"You promised to bring a knife, and to leave it with me after our\ninterview.\"\n\n\"Say no more of that, madame,\" said Felton. \"There is no situation,\nhowever terrible it may be, which can authorize a creature of God to\ninflict death upon himself. I have reflected, and I cannot, must not be\nguilty of such a sin.\"\n\n\"Ah, you have reflected!\" said the prisoner, sitting down in her\narmchair, with a smile of disdain; \"and I also have reflected.\"\n\n\"Upon what?\"\n\n\"That I can have nothing to say to a man who does not keep his word.\"\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" murmured Felton.\n\n\"You may retire,\" said Milady. \"I will not talk.\"\n\n\"Here is the knife,\" said Felton, drawing from his pocket the weapon\nwhich he had brought, according to his promise, but which he hesitated\nto give to his prisoner.\n\n\"Let me see it,\" said Milady.\n\n\"For what purpose?\"\n\n\"Upon my honor, I will instantly return it to you. You shall place it on\nthat table, and you may remain between it and me.\"\n\nFelton offered the weapon to Milady, who examined the temper of it\nattentively, and who tried the point on the tip of her finger.\n\n\"Well,\" said she, returning the knife to the young officer, \"this is\nfine and good steel. You are a faithful friend, Felton.\"\n\nFelton took back the weapon, and laid it upon the table, as he had\nagreed with the prisoner.\n\nMilady followed him with her eyes, and made a gesture of satisfaction.\n\n\"Now,\" said she, \"listen to me.\"\n\nThe request was needless. The young officer stood upright before her,\nawaiting her words as if to devour them.\n\n\"Felton,\" said Milady, with a solemnity full of melancholy, \"imagine\nthat your sister, the daughter of your father, speaks to you. While yet\nyoung, unfortunately handsome, I was dragged into a snare. I resisted.\nAmbushes and violences multiplied around me, but I resisted. The\nreligion I serve, the God I adore, were blasphemed because I called upon\nthat religion and that God, but still I resisted. Then outrages were\nheaped upon me, and as my soul was not subdued they wished to defile my\nbody forever. Finally--\"\n\nMilady stopped, and a bitter smile passed over her lips.\n\n\"Finally,\" said Felton, \"finally, what did they do?\"\n\n\"At length, one evening my enemy resolved to paralyze the resistance\nhe could not conquer. One evening he mixed a powerful narcotic with my\nwater. Scarcely had I finished my repast, when I felt myself sink by\ndegrees into a strange torpor. Although I was without mistrust, a vague\nfear seized me, and I tried to struggle against sleepiness. I arose. I\nwished to run to the window and call for help, but my legs refused their\noffice. It appeared as if the ceiling sank upon my head and crushed me\nwith its weight. I stretched out my arms. I tried to speak. I could only\nutter inarticulate sounds, and irresistible faintness came over me. I\nsupported myself by a chair, feeling that I was about to fall, but this\nsupport was soon insufficient on account of my weak arms. I fell upon\none knee, then upon both. I tried to pray, but my tongue was frozen. God\ndoubtless neither heard nor saw me, and I sank upon the floor a prey to\na slumber which resembled death.\n\n\"Of all that passed in that sleep, or the time which glided away while\nit lasted, I have no remembrance. The only thing I recollect is that I\nawoke in bed in a round chamber, the furniture of which was sumptuous,\nand into which light only penetrated by an opening in the ceiling. No\ndoor gave entrance to the room. It might be called a magnificent prison.\n\n\"It was a long time before I was able to make out what place I was in,\nor to take account of the details I describe. My mind appeared to strive\nin vain to shake off the heavy darkness of the sleep from which I could\nnot rouse myself. I had vague perceptions of space traversed, of the\nrolling of a carriage, of a horrible dream in which my strength had\nbecome exhausted; but all this was so dark and so indistinct in my mind\nthat these events seemed to belong to another life than mine, and yet\nmixed with mine in fantastic duality.\n\n\"At times the state into which I had fallen appeared so strange that I\nbelieved myself dreaming. I arose trembling. My clothes were near me on\na chair; I neither remembered having undressed myself nor going to bed.\nThen by degrees the reality broke upon me, full of chaste terrors. I was\nno longer in the house where I had dwelt. As well as I could judge by\nthe light of the sun, the day was already two-thirds gone. It was the\nevening before when I had fallen asleep; my sleep, then, must have\nlasted twenty-four hours! What had taken place during this long sleep?\n\n\"I dressed myself as quickly as possible; my slow and stiff motions\nall attested that the effects of the narcotic were not yet entirely\ndissipated. The chamber was evidently furnished for the reception of a\nwoman; and the most finished coquette could not have formed a wish, but\non casting her eyes about the apartment, she would have found that wish\naccomplished.\n\n\"Certainly I was not the first captive that had been shut up in this\nsplendid prison; but you may easily comprehend, Felton, that the more\nsuperb the prison, the greater was my terror.\n\n\"Yes, it was a prison, for I tried in vain to get out of it. I sounded\nall the walls, in the hopes of discovering a door, but everywhere the\nwalls returned a full and flat sound.\n\n\"I made the tour of the room at least twenty times, in search of an\noutlet of some kind; but there was none. I sank exhausted with fatigue\nand terror into an armchair.\n\n\"Meantime, night came on rapidly, and with night my terrors increased.\nI did not know but I had better remain where I was seated. It appeared\nthat I was surrounded with unknown dangers into which I was about to\nfall at every instant. Although I had eaten nothing since the evening\nbefore, my fears prevented my feeling hunger.\n\n\"No noise from without by which I could measure the time reached me; I\nonly supposed it must be seven or eight o'clock in the evening, for it\nwas in the month of October and it was quite dark.\n\n\"All at once the noise of a door, turning on its hinges, made me start.\nA globe of fire appeared above the glazed opening of the ceiling,\ncasting a strong light into my chamber; and I perceived with terror that\na man was standing within a few paces of me.\n\n\"A table, with two covers, bearing a supper ready prepared, stood, as if\nby magic, in the middle of the apartment.\n\n\"That man was he who had pursued me during a whole year, who had vowed\nmy dishonor, and who, by the first words that issued from his mouth,\ngave me to understand he had accomplished it the preceding night.\"\n\n\"Scoundrel!\" murmured Felton.\n\n\"Oh, yes, scoundrel!\" cried Milady, seeing the interest which the young\nofficer, whose soul seemed to hang on her lips, took in this strange\nrecital. \"Oh, yes, scoundrel! He believed, having triumphed over me in\nmy sleep, that all was completed. He came, hoping that I would accept\nmy shame, as my shame was consummated; he came to offer his fortune in\nexchange for my love.\n\n\"All that the heart of a woman could contain of haughty contempt\nand disdainful words, I poured out upon this man. Doubtless he was\naccustomed to such reproaches, for he listened to me calm and smiling,\nwith his arms crossed over his breast. Then, when he thought I had said\nall, he advanced toward me; I sprang toward the table, I seized a knife,\nI placed it to my breast.\n\n\"Take one step more,\" said I, \"and in addition to my dishonor, you shall\nhave my death to reproach yourself with.\"\n\n\"There was, no doubt, in my look, my voice, my whole person, that\nsincerity of gesture, of attitude, of accent, which carries conviction\nto the most perverse minds, for he paused.\n\n\"'Your death?' said he; 'oh, no, you are too charming a mistress to\nallow me to consent to lose you thus, after I have had the happiness to\npossess you only a single time. Adieu, my charmer; I will wait to pay\nyou my next visit till you are in a better humor.'\n\n\"At these words he blew a whistle; the globe of fire which lighted\nthe room reascended and disappeared. I found myself again in complete\ndarkness. The same noise of a door opening and shutting was repeated\nthe instant afterward; the flaming globe descended afresh, and I was\ncompletely alone.\n\n\"This moment was frightful; if I had any doubts as to my misfortune,\nthese doubts had vanished in an overwhelming reality. I was in the power\nof a man whom I not only detested, but despised--of a man capable of\nanything, and who had already given me a fatal proof of what he was able\nto do.\"\n\n\"But who, then was this man?\" asked Felton.\n\n\"I passed the night on a chair, starting at the least noise, for toward\nmidnight the lamp went out, and I was again in darkness. But the night\npassed away without any fresh attempt on the part of my persecutor. Day\ncame; the table had disappeared, only I had still the knife in my hand.\n\n\"This knife was my only hope.\n\n\"I was worn out with fatigue. Sleeplessness inflamed my eyes; I had not\ndared to sleep a single instant. The light of day reassured me; I went\nand threw myself on the bed, without parting with the emancipating\nknife, which I concealed under my pillow.\n\n\"When I awoke, a fresh meal was served.\n\n\"This time, in spite of my terrors, in spite of my agony, I began to\nfeel a devouring hunger. It was forty-eight hours since I had taken\nany nourishment. I ate some bread and some fruit; then, remembering the\nnarcotic mixed with the water I had drunk, I would not touch that which\nwas placed on the table, but filled my glass at a marble fountain fixed\nin the wall over my dressing table.\n\n\"And yet, notwithstanding these precautions, I remained for some time in\na terrible agitation of mind. But my fears were this time ill-founded; I\npassed the day without experiencing anything of the kind I dreaded.\n\n\"I took the precaution to half empty the carafe, in order that my\nsuspicions might not be noticed.\n\n\"The evening came on, and with it darkness; but however profound was\nthis darkness, my eyes began to accustom themselves to it. I saw, amid\nthe shadows, the table sink through the floor; a quarter of an hour\nlater it reappeared, bearing my supper. In an instant, thanks to the\nlamp, my chamber was once more lighted.\n\n\"I was determined to eat only such things as could not possibly have\nanything soporific introduced into them. Two eggs and some fruit\ncomposed my repast; then I drew another glass of water from my\nprotecting fountain, and drank it.\n\n\"At the first swallow, it appeared to me not to have the same taste\nas in the morning. Suspicion instantly seized me. I paused, but I had\nalready drunk half a glass.\n\n\"I threw the rest away with horror, and waited, with the dew of fear\nupon my brow.\n\n\"No doubt some invisible witness had seen me draw the water from that\nfountain, and had taken advantage of my confidence in it, the better to\nassure my ruin, so coolly resolved upon, so cruelly pursued.\n\n\"Half an hour had not passed when the same symptoms began to appear; but\nas I had only drunk half a glass of the water, I contended longer, and\ninstead of falling entirely asleep, I sank into a state of drowsiness\nwhich left me a perception of what was passing around me, while\ndepriving me of the strength either to defend myself or to fly.\n\n\"I dragged myself toward the bed, to seek the only defense I had\nleft--my saving knife; but I could not reach the bolster. I sank on my\nknees, my hands clasped round one of the bedposts; then I felt that I\nwas lost.\"\n\nFelton became frightfully pale, and a convulsive tremor crept through\nhis whole body.\n\n\"And what was most frightful,\" continued Milady, her voice altered, as\nif she still experienced the same agony as at that awful minute,\n\"was that at this time I retained a consciousness of the danger that\nthreatened me; was that my soul, if I may say so, waked in my sleeping\nbody; was that I saw, that I heard. It is true that all was like a\ndream, but it was not the less frightful.\n\n\"I saw the lamp ascend, and leave me in darkness; then I heard the\nwell-known creaking of the door although I had heard that door open but\ntwice.\n\n\"I felt instinctively that someone approached me; it is said that the\ndoomed wretch in the deserts of America thus feels the approach of the\nserpent.\n\n\"I wished to make an effort; I attempted to cry out. By an incredible\neffort of will I even raised myself up, but only to sink down again\nimmediately, and to fall into the arms of my persecutor.\"\n\n\"Tell me who this man was!\" cried the young officer.\n\nMilady saw at a single glance all the painful feelings she inspired in\nFelton by dwelling on every detail of her recital; but she would not\nspare him a single pang. The more profoundly she wounded his heart, the\nmore certainly he would avenge her. She continued, then, as if she had\nnot heard his exclamation, or as if she thought the moment was not yet\ncome to reply to it.\n\n\"Only this time it was no longer an inert body, without feeling, that\nthe villain had to deal with. I have told you that without being able to\nregain the complete exercise of my faculties, I retained the sense of my\ndanger. I struggled, then, with all my strength, and doubtless opposed,\nweak as I was, a long resistance, for I heard him cry out, 'These\nmiserable Puritans! I knew very well that they tired out their\nexecutioners, but I did not believe them so strong against their\nlovers!'\n\n\"Alas! this desperate resistance could not last long. I felt my strength\nfail, and this time it was not my sleep that enabled the coward to\nprevail, but my swoon.\"\n\nFelton listened without uttering any word or sound, except an inward\nexpression of agony. The sweat streamed down his marble forehead, and\nhis hand, under his coat, tore his breast.\n\n\"My first impulse, on coming to myself, was to feel under my pillow for\nthe knife I had not been able to reach; if it had not been useful for\ndefense, it might at least serve for expiation.\n\n\"But on taking this knife, Felton, a terrible idea occurred to me. I\nhave sworn to tell you all, and I will tell you all. I have promised you\nthe truth; I will tell it, were it to destroy me.\"\n\n\"The idea came into your mind to avenge yourself on this man, did it\nnot?\" cried Felton.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Milady. \"The idea was not that of a Christian, I knew;\nbut without doubt, that eternal enemy of our souls, that lion roaring\nconstantly around us, breathed it into my mind. In short, what shall I\nsay to you, Felton?\" continued Milady, in the tone of a woman accusing\nherself of a crime. \"This idea occurred to me, and did not leave me; it\nis of this homicidal thought that I now bear the punishment.\"\n\n\"Continue, continue!\" said Felton; \"I am eager to see you attain your\nvengeance!\"\n\n\"Oh, I resolved that it should take place as soon as possible. I had no\ndoubt he would return the following night. During the day I had nothing\nto fear.\n\n\"When the hour of breakfast came, therefore, I did not hesitate to eat\nand drink. I had determined to make believe sup, but to eat nothing. I\nwas forced, then, to combat the fast of the evening with the nourishment\nof the morning.\n\n\"Only I concealed a glass of water, which remained after my breakfast,\nthirst having been the chief of my sufferings when I remained\nforty-eight hours without eating or drinking.\n\n\"The day passed away without having any other influence on me than to\nstrengthen the resolution I had formed; only I took care that my face\nshould not betray the thoughts of my heart, for I had no doubt I was\nwatched. Several times, even, I felt a smile on my lips. Felton, I dare\nnot tell you at what idea I smiled; you would hold me in horror--\"\n\n\"Go on! go on!\" said Felton; \"you see plainly that I listen, and that I\nam anxious to know the end.\"\n\n\"Evening came; the ordinary events took place. During the darkness, as\nbefore, my supper was brought. Then the lamp was lighted, and I sat down\nto table. I only ate some fruit. I pretended to pour out water from\nthe jug, but I only drank that which I had saved in my glass. The\nsubstitution was made so carefully that my spies, if I had any, could\nhave no suspicion of it.\n\n\"After supper I exhibited the same marks of languor as on the preceding\nevening; but this time, as I yielded to fatigue, or as if I had become\nfamiliarized with danger, I dragged myself toward my bed, let my robe\nfall, and lay down.\n\n\"I found my knife where I had placed it, under my pillow, and while\nfeigning to sleep, my hand grasped the handle of it convulsively.\n\n\"Two hours passed away without anything fresh happening. Oh, my God! who\ncould have said so the evening before? I began to fear that he would not\ncome.\n\n\"At length I saw the lamp rise softly, and disappear in the depths of\nthe ceiling; my chamber was filled with darkness and obscurity, but I\nmade a strong effort to penetrate this darkness and obscurity.\n\n\"Nearly ten minutes passed; I heard no other noise but the beating of my\nown heart. I implored heaven that he might come.\n\n\"At length I heard the well-known noise of the door, which opened and\nshut; I heard, notwithstanding the thickness of the carpet, a step which\nmade the floor creak; I saw, notwithstanding the darkness, a shadow\nwhich approached my bed.\"\n\n\"Haste! haste!\" said Felton; \"do you not see that each of your words\nburns me like molten lead?\"\n\n\"Then,\" continued Milady, \"then I collected all my strength; I recalled\nto my mind that the moment of vengeance, or rather, of justice, had\nstruck. I looked upon myself as another Judith; I gathered myself up, my\nknife in my hand, and when I saw him near me, stretching out his arms to\nfind his victim, then, with the last cry of agony and despair, I struck\nhim in the middle of his breast.\n\n\"The miserable villain! He had foreseen all. His breast was covered with\na coat-of-mail; the knife was bent against it.\n\n\"'Ah, ah!' cried he, seizing my arm, and wresting from me the weapon\nthat had so badly served me, 'you want to take my life, do you, my\npretty Puritan? But that's more than dislike, that's ingratitude! Come,\ncome, calm yourself, my sweet girl! I thought you had softened. I am not\none of those tyrants who detain women by force. You don't love me. With\nmy usual fatuity I doubted it; now I am convinced. Tomorrow you shall be\nfree.'\n\n\"I had but one wish; that was that he should kill me.\n\n\"'Beware!' said I, 'for my liberty is your dishonor.'\n\n\"'Explain yourself, my pretty sibyl!'\n\n\"'Yes; for as soon as I leave this place I will tell everything. I\nwill proclaim the violence you have used toward me. I will describe my\ncaptivity. I will denounce this place of infamy. You are placed on high,\nmy Lord, but tremble! Above you there is the king; above the king there\nis God!'\n\n\"However perfect master he was over himself, my persecutor allowed a\nmovement of anger to escape him. I could not see the expression of his\ncountenance, but I felt the arm tremble upon which my hand was placed.\n\n\"'Then you shall not leave this place,' said he.\n\n\"'Very well,' cried I, 'then the place of my punishment will be that of\nmy tomb. I will die here, and you will see if a phantom that accuses is\nnot more terrible than a living being that threatens!'\n\n\"'You shall have no weapon left in your power.'\n\n\"'There is a weapon which despair has placed within the reach of every\ncreature who has the courage to use it. I will allow myself to die with\nhunger.'\n\n\"'Come,' said the wretch, 'is not peace much better than such a war as\nthat? I will restore you to liberty this moment; I will proclaim you a\npiece of immaculate virtue; I will name you the Lucretia of England.'\n\n\"'And I will say that you are the Sextus. I will denounce you before\nmen, as I have denounced you before God; and if it be necessary that,\nlike Lucretia, I should sign my accusation with my blood, I will sign\nit.'\n\n\"'Ah!' said my enemy, in a jeering tone, 'that's quite another thing. My\nfaith! everything considered, you are very well off here. You shall want\nfor nothing, and if you let yourself die of hunger that will be your own\nfault.'\n\n\"At these words he retired. I heard the door open and shut, and I\nremained overwhelmed, less, I confess it, by my grief than by the\nmortification of not having avenged myself.\n\n\"He kept his word. All the day, all the next night passed away without\nmy seeing him again. But I also kept my word with him, and I neither ate\nnor drank. I was, as I told him, resolved to die of hunger.\n\n\"I passed the day and the night in prayer, for I hoped that God would\npardon me my suicide.\n\n\"The second night the door opened; I was lying on the floor, for my\nstrength began to abandon me.\n\n\"At the noise I raised myself up on one hand.\n\n\"'Well,' said a voice which vibrated in too terrible a manner in my ear\nnot to be recognized, 'well! Are we softened a little? Will we not pay\nfor our liberty with a single promise of silence? Come, I am a good\nsort of a prince,' added he, 'and although I like not Puritans I do them\njustice; and it is the same with Puritanesses, when they are pretty.\nCome, take a little oath for me on the cross; I won't ask anything more\nof you.'\n\n\"'On the cross,' cried I, rising, for at that abhorred voice I had\nrecovered all my strength, 'on the cross I swear that no promise, no\nmenace, no force, no torture, shall close my mouth! On the cross I swear\nto denounce you everywhere as a murderer, as a thief of honor, as a base\ncoward! On the cross I swear, if I ever leave this place, to call down\nvengeance upon you from the whole human race!'\n\n\"'Beware!' said the voice, in a threatening accent that I had never yet\nheard. 'I have an extraordinary means which I will not employ but in the\nlast extremity to close your mouth, or at least to prevent anyone from\nbelieving a word you may utter.'\n\n\"I mustered all my strength to reply to him with a burst of laughter.\n\n\"He saw that it was a merciless war between us--a war to the death.\n\n\"'Listen!' said he. 'I give you the rest of tonight and all day\ntomorrow. Reflect: promise to be silent, and riches, consideration, even\nhonor, shall surround you; threaten to speak, and I will condemn you to\ninfamy.'\n\n\"'You?' cried I. 'You?'\n\n\"'To interminable, ineffaceable infamy!'\n\n\"'You?' repeated I. Oh, I declare to you, Felton, I thought him mad!\n\n\"'Yes, yes, I!' replied he.\n\n\"'Oh, leave me!' said I. 'Begone, if you do not desire to see me dash my\nhead against that wall before your eyes!'\n\n\"'Very well, it is your own doing. Till tomorrow evening, then!'\n\n\"'Till tomorrow evening, then!' replied I, allowing myself to fall, and\nbiting the carpet with rage.\"\n\nFelton leaned for support upon a piece of furniture; and Milady saw,\nwith the joy of a demon, that his strength would fail him perhaps before\nthe end of her recital.\n\n\n\n\n57 MEANS FOR CLASSICAL TRAGEDY\n\nAfter a moment of silence employed by Milady in observing the young man\nwho listened to her, Milady continued her recital.\n\n\"It was nearly three days since I had eaten or drunk anything. I\nsuffered frightful torments. At times there passed before me clouds\nwhich pressed my brow, which veiled my eyes; this was delirium.\n\n\"When the evening came I was so weak that every time I fainted I thanked\nGod, for I thought I was about to die.\n\n\"In the midst of one of these swoons I heard the door open. Terror\nrecalled me to myself.\n\n\"He entered the apartment followed by a man in a mask. He was masked\nlikewise; but I knew his step, I knew his voice, I knew him by that\nimposing bearing which hell has bestowed upon his person for the curse\nof humanity.\n\n\"'Well,' said he to me, 'have you made your mind up to take the oath I\nrequested of you?'\n\n\"'You have said Puritans have but one word. Mine you have heard, and\nthat is to pursue you--on earth to the tribunal of men, in heaven to the\ntribunal of God.'\n\n\"'You persist, then?'\n\n\"'I swear it before the God who hears me. I will take the whole world as\na witness of your crime, and that until I have found an avenger.'\n\n\"'You are a prostitute,' said he, in a voice of thunder, 'and you shall\nundergo the punishment of prostitutes! Branded in the eyes of the world\nyou invoke, try to prove to that world that you are neither guilty nor\nmad!'\n\n\"Then, addressing the man who accompanied him, 'Executioner,' said he,\n'do your duty.'\"\n\n\"Oh, his name, his name!\" cried Felton. \"His name, tell it me!\"\n\n\"Then in spite of my cries, in spite of my resistance--for I began to\ncomprehend that there was a question of something worse than death--the\nexecutioner seized me, threw me on the floor, fastened me with his\nbonds, and suffocated by sobs, almost without sense, invoking God, who\ndid not listen to me, I uttered all at once a frightful cry of pain and\nshame. A burning fire, a red-hot iron, the iron of the executioner, was\nimprinted on my shoulder.\"\n\nFelton uttered a groan.\n\n\"Here,\" said Milady, rising with the majesty of a queen, \"here, Felton,\nbehold the new martyrdom invented for a pure young girl, the victim\nof the brutality of a villain. Learn to know the heart of men, and\nhenceforth make yourself less easily the instrument of their unjust\nvengeance.\"\n\nMilady, with a rapid gesture, opened her robe, tore the cambric that\ncovered her bosom, and red with feigned anger and simulated shame,\nshowed the young man the ineffaceable impression which dishonored that\nbeautiful shoulder.\n\n\"But,\" cried Felton, \"that is a FLEUR-DE-LIS which I see there.\"\n\n\"And therein consisted the infamy,\" replied Milady. \"The brand of\nEngland!--it would be necessary to prove what tribunal had imposed it\non me, and I could have made a public appeal to all the tribunals of the\nkingdom; but the brand of France!--oh, by that, by THAT I was branded\nindeed!\"\n\nThis was too much for Felton.\n\nPale, motionless, overwhelmed by this frightful revelation, dazzled by\nthe superhuman beauty of this woman who unveiled herself before him with\nan immodesty which appeared to him sublime, he ended by falling on his\nknees before her as the early Christians did before those pure and holy\nmartyrs whom the persecution of the emperors gave up in the circus to\nthe sanguinary sensuality of the populace. The brand disappeared; the\nbeauty alone remained.\n\n\"Pardon! Pardon!\" cried Felton, \"oh, pardon!\"\n\nMilady read in his eyes LOVE! LOVE!\n\n\"Pardon for what?\" asked she.\n\n\"Pardon me for having joined with your persecutors.\"\n\nMilady held out her hand to him.\n\n\"So beautiful! so young!\" cried Felton, covering that hand with his\nkisses.\n\nMilady let one of those looks fall upon him which make a slave of a\nking.\n\nFelton was a Puritan; he abandoned the hand of this woman to kiss her\nfeet.\n\nHe no longer loved her; he adored her.\n\nWhen this crisis was past, when Milady appeared to have resumed her\nself-possession, which she had never lost; when Felton had seen her\nrecover with the veil of chastity those treasures of love which were\nonly concealed from him to make him desire them the more ardently, he\nsaid, \"Ah, now! I have only one thing to ask of you; that is, the name\nof your true executioner. For to me there is but one; the other was an\ninstrument, that was all.\"\n\n\"What, brother!\" cried Milady, \"must I name him again? Have you not yet\ndivined who he is?\"\n\n\"What?\" cried Felton, \"he--again he--always he? What--the truly guilty?\"\n\n\"The truly guilty,\" said Milady, \"is the ravager of England, the\npersecutor of true believers, the base ravisher of the honor of so many\nwomen--he who, to satisfy a caprice of his corrupt heart, is about to\nmake England shed so much blood, who protects the Protestants today and\nwill betray them tomorrow--\"\n\n\"Buckingham! It is, then, Buckingham!\" cried Felton, in a high state of\nexcitement.\n\nMilady concealed her face in her hands, as if she could not endure the\nshame which this name recalled to her.\n\n\"Buckingham, the executioner of this angelic creature!\" cried Felton.\n\"And thou hast not hurled thy thunder at him, my God! And thou hast left\nhim noble, honored, powerful, for the ruin of us all!\"\n\n\"God abandons him who abandons himself,\" said Milady.\n\n\"But he will draw upon his head the punishment reserved for the damned!\"\nsaid Felton, with increasing exultation. \"He wills that human vengeance\nshould precede celestial justice.\"\n\n\"Men fear him and spare him.\"\n\n\"I,\" said Felton, \"I do not fear him, nor will I spare him.\"\n\nThe soul of Milady was bathed in an infernal joy.\n\n\"But how can Lord de Winter, my protector, my father,\" asked Felton,\n\"possibly be mixed up with all this?\"\n\n\"Listen, Felton,\" resumed Milady, \"for by the side of base and\ncontemptible men there are often found great and generous natures. I had\nan affianced husband, a man whom I loved, and who loved me--a heart like\nyours, Felton, a man like you. I went to him and told him all; he knew\nme, that man did, and did not doubt an instant. He was a nobleman, a man\nequal to Buckingham in every respect. He said nothing; he only girded on\nhis sword, wrapped himself in his cloak, and went straight to Buckingham\nPalace.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Felton; \"I understand how he would act. But with such\nmen it is not the sword that should be employed; it is the poniard.\"\n\n\"Buckingham had left England the day before, sent as ambassador to\nSpain, to demand the hand of the Infanta for King Charles I, who was\nthen only Prince of Wales. My affianced husband returned.\n\n\"'Hear me,' said he; 'this man has gone, and for the moment has\nconsequently escaped my vengeance; but let us be united, as we were to\nhave been, and then leave it to Lord de Winter to maintain his own honor\nand that of his wife.'\"\n\n\"Lord de Winter!\" cried Felton.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Milady, \"Lord de Winter; and now you can understand it all,\ncan you not? Buckingham remained nearly a year absent. A week before his\nreturn Lord de Winter died, leaving me his sole heir. Whence came the\nblow? God who knows all, knows without doubt; but as for me, I accuse\nnobody.\"\n\n\"Oh, what an abyss; what an abyss!\" cried Felton.\n\n\"Lord de Winter died without revealing anything to his brother. The\nterrible secret was to be concealed till it burst, like a clap of\nthunder, over the head of the guilty. Your protector had seen with\npain this marriage of his elder brother with a portionless girl. I was\nsensible that I could look for no support from a man disappointed in\nhis hopes of an inheritance. I went to France, with a determination to\nremain there for the rest of my life. But all my fortune is in England.\nCommunication being closed by the war, I was in want of everything.\nI was then obliged to come back again. Six days ago, I landed at\nPortsmouth.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Felton.\n\n\"Well; Buckingham heard by some means, no doubt, of my return. He spoke\nof me to Lord de Winter, already prejudiced against me, and told him\nthat his sister-in-law was a prostitute, a branded woman. The noble and\npure voice of my husband was no longer here to defend me. Lord de Winter\nbelieved all that was told him with so much the more ease that it\nwas his interest to believe it. He caused me to be arrested, had me\nconducted hither, and placed me under your guard. You know the rest.\nThe day after tomorrow he banishes me, he transports me; the day after\ntomorrow he exiles me among the infamous. Oh, the train is well laid;\nthe plot is clever. My honor will not survive it! You see, then, Felton,\nI can do nothing but die. Felton, give me that knife!\"\n\nAnd at these words, as if all her strength was exhausted, Milady\nsank, weak and languishing, into the arms of the young officer, who,\nintoxicated with love, anger, and voluptuous sensations hitherto\nunknown, received her with transport, pressed her against his heart,\nall trembling at the breath from that charming mouth, bewildered by the\ncontact with that palpitating bosom.\n\n\"No, no,\" said he. \"No, you shall live honored and pure; you shall live\nto triumph over your enemies.\"\n\nMilady put him from her slowly with her hand, while drawing him nearer\nwith her look; but Felton, in his turn, embraced her more closely,\nimploring her like a divinity.\n\n\"Oh, death, death!\" said she, lowering her voice and her eyelids, \"oh,\ndeath, rather than shame! Felton, my brother, my friend, I conjure you!\"\n\n\"No,\" cried Felton, \"no; you shall live and you shall be avenged.\"\n\n\"Felton, I bring misfortune to all who surround me! Felton, abandon me!\nFelton, let me die!\"\n\n\"Well, then, we will live and die together!\" cried he, pressing his lips\nto those of the prisoner.\n\nSeveral strokes resounded on the door; this time Milady really pushed\nhim away from her.\n\n\"Hark,\" said she, \"we have been overheard! Someone is coming! All is\nover! We are lost!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Felton; it is only the sentinel warning me that they are\nabout to change the guard.\"\n\n\"Then run to the door, and open it yourself.\"\n\nFelton obeyed; this woman was now his whole thought, his whole soul.\n\nHe found himself face to face with a sergeant commanding a watch-patrol.\n\n\"Well, what is the matter?\" asked the young lieutenant.\n\n\"You told me to open the door if I heard anyone cry out,\" said the\nsoldier; \"but you forgot to leave me the key. I heard you cry out,\nwithout understanding what you said. I tried to open the door, but it\nwas locked inside; then I called the sergeant.\"\n\n\"And here I am,\" said the sergeant.\n\nFelton, quite bewildered, almost mad, stood speechless.\n\nMilady plainly perceived that it was now her turn to take part in the\nscene. She ran to the table, and seizing the knife which Felton had laid\ndown, exclaimed, \"And by what right will you prevent me from dying?\"\n\n\"Great God!\" exclaimed Felton, on seeing the knife glitter in her hand.\n\nAt that moment a burst of ironical laughter resounded through the\ncorridor. The baron, attracted by the noise, in his chamber gown, his\nsword under his arm, stood in the doorway.\n\n\"Ah,\" said he, \"here we are, at the last act of the tragedy. You see,\nFelton, the drama has gone through all the phases I named; but be easy,\nno blood will flow.\"\n\nMilady perceived that all was lost unless she gave Felton an immediate\nand terrible proof of her courage.\n\n\"You are mistaken, my Lord, blood will flow; and may that blood fall\nback on those who cause it to flow!\"\n\nFelton uttered a cry, and rushed toward her. He was too late; Milady had\nstabbed herself.\n\nBut the knife had fortunately, we ought to say skillfully, come in\ncontact with the steel busk, which at that period, like a cuirass,\ndefended the chests of women. It had glided down it, tearing the robe,\nand had penetrated slantingly between the flesh and the ribs. Milady's\nrobe was not the less stained with blood in a second.\n\nMilady fell down, and seemed to be in a swoon.\n\nFelton snatched away the knife.\n\n\"See, my Lord,\" said he, in a deep, gloomy tone, \"here is a woman who\nwas under my guard, and who has killed herself!\"\n\n\"Be at ease, Felton,\" said Lord de Winter. \"She is not dead; demons do\nnot die so easily. Be tranquil, and go wait for me in my chamber.\"\n\n\"But, my Lord--\"\n\n\"Go, sir, I command you!\"\n\nAt this injunction from his superior, Felton obeyed; but in going out,\nhe put the knife into his bosom.\n\nAs to Lord de Winter, he contented himself with calling the woman who\nwaited on Milady, and when she was come, he recommended the prisoner,\nwho was still fainting, to her care, and left them alone.\n\nMeanwhile, all things considered and notwithstanding his suspicions,\nas the wound might be serious, he immediately sent off a mounted man to\nfind a physician.\n\n\n\n\n58 ESCAPE\n\nAs Lord de Winter had thought, Milady's wound was not dangerous. So soon\nas she was left alone with the woman whom the baron had summoned to her\nassistance she opened her eyes.\n\nIt was, however, necessary to affect weakness and pain--not a very\ndifficult task for so finished an actress as Milady. Thus the poor\nwoman was completely the dupe of the prisoner, whom, notwithstanding her\nhints, she persisted in watching all night.\n\nBut the presence of this woman did not prevent Milady from thinking.\n\nThere was no longer a doubt that Felton was convinced; Felton was hers.\nIf an angel appeared to that young man as an accuser of Milady, he would\ntake him, in the mental disposition in which he now found himself, for a\nmessenger sent by the devil.\n\nMilady smiled at this thought, for Felton was now her only hope--her\nonly means of safety.\n\nBut Lord de Winter might suspect him; Felton himself might now be\nwatched!\n\nToward four o'clock in the morning the doctor arrived; but since the\ntime Milady stabbed herself, however short, the wound had closed. The\ndoctor could therefore measure neither the direction nor the depth of\nit; he only satisfied himself by Milady's pulse that the case was not\nserious.\n\nIn the morning Milady, under the pretext that she had not slept well in\nthe night and wanted rest, sent away the woman who attended her.\n\nShe had one hope, which was that Felton would appear at the breakfast\nhour; but Felton did not come.\n\nWere her fears realized? Was Felton, suspected by the baron, about to\nfail her at the decisive moment? She had only one day left. Lord de\nWinter had announced her embarkation for the twenty-third, and it was\nnow the morning of the twenty-second.\n\nNevertheless she still waited patiently till the hour for dinner.\n\nAlthough she had eaten nothing in the morning, the dinner was brought in\nat its usual time. Milady then perceived, with terror, that the uniform\nof the soldiers who guarded her was changed.\n\nThen she ventured to ask what had become of Felton.\n\nShe was told that he had left the castle an hour before on horseback.\nShe inquired if the baron was still at the castle. The soldier replied\nthat he was, and that he had given orders to be informed if the prisoner\nwished to speak to him.\n\nMilady replied that she was too weak at present, and that her only\ndesire was to be left alone.\n\nThe soldier went out, leaving the dinner served.\n\nFelton was sent away. The marines were removed. Felton was then\nmistrusted.\n\nThis was the last blow to the prisoner.\n\nLeft alone, she arose. The bed, which she had kept from prudence and\nthat they might believe her seriously wounded, burned her like a bed of\nfire. She cast a glance at the door; the baron had had a plank nailed\nover the grating. He no doubt feared that by this opening she might\nstill by some diabolical means corrupt her guards.\n\nMilady smiled with joy. She was free now to give way to her transports\nwithout being observed. She traversed her chamber with the excitement of\na furious maniac or of a tigress shut up in an iron cage. CERTES, if\nthe knife had been left in her power, she would now have thought, not of\nkilling herself, but of killing the baron.\n\nAt six o'clock Lord de Winter came in. He was armed at all points.\nThis man, in whom Milady till that time had only seen a very simple\ngentleman, had become an admirable jailer. He appeared to foresee all,\nto divine all, to anticipate all.\n\nA single look at Milady apprised him of all that was passing in her\nmind.\n\n\"Ay!\" said he, \"I see; but you shall not kill me today. You have no\nlonger a weapon; and besides, I am on my guard. You had begun to pervert\nmy poor Felton. He was yielding to your infernal influence; but I will\nsave him. He will never see you again; all is over. Get your clothes\ntogether. Tomorrow you will go. I had fixed the embarkation for the\ntwenty-fourth; but I have reflected that the more promptly the affair\ntakes place the more sure it will be. Tomorrow, by twelve o'clock, I\nshall have the order for your exile, signed, BUCKINGHAM. If you speak\na single word to anyone before going aboard ship, my sergeant will blow\nyour brains out. He has orders to do so. If when on the ship you speak\na single word to anyone before the captain permits you, the captain will\nhave you thrown into the sea. That is agreed upon.\n\n\"AU REVOIR; then; that is all I have to say today. Tomorrow I will\nsee you again, to take my leave.\" With these words the baron went out.\nMilady had listened to all this menacing tirade with a smile of disdain\non her lips, but rage in her heart.\n\nSupper was served. Milady felt that she stood in need of all her\nstrength. She did not know what might take place during this night which\napproached so menacingly--for large masses of cloud rolled over the face\nof the sky, and distant lightning announced a storm.\n\nThe storm broke about ten o'clock. Milady felt a consolation in seeing\nnature partake of the disorder of her heart. The thunder growled in the\nair like the passion and anger in her thoughts. It appeared to her\nthat the blast as it swept along disheveled her brow, as it bowed the\nbranches of the trees and bore away their leaves. She howled as the\nhurricane howled; and her voice was lost in the great voice of nature,\nwhich also seemed to groan with despair.\n\nAll at once she heard a tap at her window, and by the help of a flash of\nlightning she saw the face of a man appear behind the bars.\n\nShe ran to the window and opened it.\n\n\"Felton!\" cried she. \"I am saved.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Felton; \"but silence, silence! I must have time to file\nthrough these bars. Only take care that I am not seen through the\nwicket.\"\n\n\"Oh, it is a proof that the Lord is on our side, Felton,\" replied\nMilady. \"They have closed up the grating with a board.\"\n\n\"That is well; God has made them senseless,\" said Felton.\n\n\"But what must I do?\" asked Milady.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing, only shut the window. Go to bed, or at least lie down\nin your clothes. As soon as I have done I will knock on one of the panes\nof glass. But will you be able to follow me?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\"\n\n\"Your wound?\"\n\n\"Gives me pain, but will not prevent my walking.\"\n\n\"Be ready, then, at the first signal.\"\n\nMilady shut the window, extinguished the lamp, and went, as Felton had\ndesired her, to lie down on the bed. Amid the moaning of the storm she\nheard the grinding of the file upon the bars, and by the light of every\nflash she perceived the shadow of Felton through the panes.\n\nShe passed an hour without breathing, panting, with a cold sweat upon\nher brow, and her heart oppressed by frightful agony at every movement\nshe heard in the corridor.\n\nThere are hours which last a year.\n\nAt the expiration of an hour, Felton tapped again.\n\nMilady sprang out of bed and opened the window. Two bars removed formed\nan opening for a man to pass through.\n\n\"Are you ready?\" asked Felton.\n\n\"Yes. Must I take anything with me?\"\n\n\"Money, if you have any.\"\n\n\"Yes; fortunately they have left me all I had.\"\n\n\"So much the better, for I have expended all mine in chartering a\nvessel.\"\n\n\"Here!\" said Milady, placing a bag full of louis in Felton's hands.\n\nFelton took the bag and threw it to the foot of the wall.\n\n\"Now,\" said he, \"will you come?\"\n\n\"I am ready.\"\n\nMilady mounted upon a chair and passed the upper part of her body\nthrough the window. She saw the young officer suspended over the abyss\nby a ladder of ropes. For the first time an emotion of terror reminded\nher that she was a woman.\n\nThe dark space frightened her.\n\n\"I expected this,\" said Felton.\n\n\"It's nothing, it's nothing!\" said Milady. \"I will descend with my eyes\nshut.\"\n\n\"Have you confidence in me?\" said Felton.\n\n\"You ask that?\"\n\n\"Put your two hands together. Cross them; that's right!\"\n\nFelton tied her two wrists together with his handkerchief, and then with\na cord over the handkerchief.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" asked Milady, with surprise.\n\n\"Pass your arms around my neck, and fear nothing.\"\n\n\"But I shall make you lose your balance, and we shall both be dashed to\npieces.\"\n\n\"Don't be afraid. I am a sailor.\"\n\nNot a second was to be lost. Milady passed her two arms round Felton's\nneck, and let herself slip out of the window. Felton began to descend\nthe ladder slowly, step by step. Despite the weight of two bodies, the\nblast of the hurricane shook them in the air.\n\nAll at once Felton stopped.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Milady.\n\n\"Silence,\" said Felton, \"I hear footsteps.\"\n\n\"We are discovered!\"\n\nThere was a silence of several seconds.\n\n\"No,\" said Felton, \"it is nothing.\"\n\n\"But what, then, is the noise?\"\n\n\"That of the patrol going their rounds.\"\n\n\"Where is their road?\"\n\n\"Just under us.\"\n\n\"They will discover us!\"\n\n\"No, if it does not lighten.\"\n\n\"But they will run against the bottom of the ladder.\"\n\n\"Fortunately it is too short by six feet.\"\n\n\"Here they are! My God!\"\n\n\"Silence!\"\n\nBoth remained suspended, motionless and breathless, within twenty\npaces of the ground, while the patrol passed beneath them laughing and\ntalking. This was a terrible moment for the fugitives.\n\nThe patrol passed. The noise of their retreating footsteps and the\nmurmur of their voices soon died away.\n\n\"Now,\" said Felton, \"we are safe.\"\n\nMilady breathed a deep sigh and fainted.\n\nFelton continued to descend. Near the bottom of the ladder, when he\nfound no more support for his feet, he clung with his hands; at length,\narrived at the last step, he let himself hang by the strength of his\nwrists, and touched the ground. He stooped down, picked up the bag of\nmoney, and placed it between his teeth. Then he took Milady in his arms,\nand set off briskly in the direction opposite to that which the patrol\nhad taken. He soon left the pathway of the patrol, descended across the\nrocks, and when arrived on the edge of the sea, whistled.\n\nA similar signal replied to him; and five minutes after, a boat\nappeared, rowed by four men.\n\nThe boat approached as near as it could to the shore; but there was not\ndepth enough of water for it to touch land. Felton walked into the\nsea up to his middle, being unwilling to trust his precious burden to\nanybody.\n\nFortunately the storm began to subside, but still the sea was disturbed.\nThe little boat bounded over the waves like a nut-shell.\n\n\"To the sloop,\" said Felton, \"and row quickly.\"\n\nThe four men bent to their oars, but the sea was too high to let them\nget much hold of it.\n\nHowever, they left the castle behind; that was the principal thing. The\nnight was extremely dark. It was almost impossible to see the shore from\nthe boat; they would therefore be less likely to see the boat from the\nshore.\n\nA black point floated on the sea. That was the sloop. While the boat\nwas advancing with all the speed its four rowers could give it, Felton\nuntied the cord and then the handkerchief which bound Milady's hands\ntogether. When her hands were loosed he took some sea water and\nsprinkled it over her face.\n\nMilady breathed a sigh, and opened her eyes.\n\n\"Where am I?\" said she.\n\n\"Saved!\" replied the young officer.\n\n\"Oh, saved, saved!\" cried she. \"Yes, there is the sky; here is the sea!\nThe air I breathe is the air of liberty! Ah, thanks, Felton, thanks!\"\n\nThe young man pressed her to his heart.\n\n\"But what is the matter with my hands!\" asked Milady; \"it seems as if my\nwrists had been crushed in a vice.\"\n\nMilady held out her arms; her wrists were bruised.\n\n\"Alas!\" said Felton, looking at those beautiful hands, and shaking his\nhead sorrowfully.\n\n\"Oh, it's nothing, nothing!\" cried Milady. \"I remember now.\"\n\nMilady looked around her, as if in search of something.\n\n\"It is there,\" said Felton, touching the bag of money with his foot.\n\nThey drew near to the sloop. A sailor on watch hailed the boat; the boat\nreplied.\n\n\"What vessel is that?\" asked Milady.\n\n\"The one I have hired for you.\"\n\n\"Where will it take me?\"\n\n\"Where you please, after you have put me on shore at Portsmouth.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do at Portsmouth?\" asked Milady.\n\n\"Accomplish the orders of Lord de Winter,\" said Felton, with a gloomy\nsmile.\n\n\"What orders?\" asked Milady.\n\n\"You do not understand?\" asked Felton.\n\n\"No; explain yourself, I beg.\"\n\n\"As he mistrusted me, he determined to guard you himself, and sent me in\nhis place to get Buckingham to sign the order for your transportation.\"\n\n\"But if he mistrusted you, how could he confide such an order to you?\"\n\n\"How could I know what I was the bearer of?\"\n\n\"That's true! And you are going to Portsmouth?\"\n\n\"I have no time to lose. Tomorrow is the twenty-third, and Buckingham\nsets sail tomorrow with his fleet.\"\n\n\"He sets sail tomorrow! Where for?\"\n\n\"For La Rochelle.\"\n\n\"He need not sail!\" cried Milady, forgetting her usual presence of mind.\n\n\"Be satisfied,\" replied Felton; \"he will not sail.\"\n\nMilady started with joy. She could read to the depths of the heart\nof this young man; the death of Buckingham was written there at full\nlength.\n\n\"Felton,\" cried she, \"you are as great as Judas Maccabeus! If you die, I\nwill die with you; that is all I can say to you.\"\n\n\"Silence!\" cried Felton; \"we are here.\"\n\nIn fact, they touched the sloop.\n\nFelton mounted the ladder first, and gave his hand to Milady, while the\nsailors supported her, for the sea was still much agitated.\n\nAn instant after they were on the deck.\n\n\"Captain,\" said Felton, \"this is the person of whom I spoke to you, and\nwhom you must convey safe and sound to France.\"\n\n\"For a thousand pistoles,\" said the captain.\n\n\"I have paid you five hundred of them.\"\n\n\"That's correct,\" said the captain.\n\n\"And here are the other five hundred,\" replied Milady, placing her hand\nupon the bag of gold.\n\n\"No,\" said the captain, \"I make but one bargain; and I have agreed with\nthis young man that the other five hundred shall not be due to me till\nwe arrive at Boulogne.\"\n\n\"And shall we arrive there?\"\n\n\"Safe and sound, as true as my name's Jack Butler.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Milady, \"if you keep your word, instead of five hundred, I\nwill give you a thousand pistoles.\"\n\n\"Hurrah for you, then, my beautiful lady,\" cried the captain; \"and may\nGod often send me such passengers as your Ladyship!\"\n\n\"Meanwhile,\" said Felton, \"convey me to the little bay of--; you know it\nwas agreed you should put in there.\"\n\nThe captain replied by ordering the necessary maneuvers, and toward\nseven o'clock in the morning the little vessel cast anchor in the bay\nthat had been named.\n\nDuring this passage, Felton related everything to Milady--how, instead\nof going to London, he had chartered the little vessel; how he had\nreturned; how he had scaled the wall by fastening cramps in the\ninterstices of the stones, as he ascended, to give him foothold; and\nhow, when he had reached the bars, he fastened his ladder. Milady knew\nthe rest.\n\nOn her side, Milady tried to encourage Felton in his project; but at the\nfirst words which issued from her mouth, she plainly saw that the young\nfanatic stood more in need of being moderated than urged.\n\nIt was agreed that Milady should wait for Felton till ten o'clock; if he\ndid not return by ten o'clock she was to sail.\n\nIn that case, and supposing he was at liberty, he was to rejoin her in\nFrance, at the convent of the Carmelites at Bethune.\n\n\n\n\n59 WHAT TOOK PLACE AT PORTSMOUTH AUGUST 23, 1628\n\nFelton took leave of Milady as a brother about to go for a mere walk\ntakes leave of his sister, kissing her hand.\n\nHis whole body appeared in its ordinary state of calmness, only an\nunusual fire beamed from his eyes, like the effects of a fever; his brow\nwas more pale than it generally was; his teeth were clenched, and his\nspeech had a short dry accent which indicated that something dark was at\nwork within him.\n\nAs long as he remained in the boat which conveyed him to land, he kept\nhis face toward Milady, who, standing on the deck, followed him with\nher eyes. Both were free from the fear of pursuit; nobody ever came into\nMilady's apartment before nine o'clock, and it would require three hours\nto go from the castle to London.\n\nFelton jumped onshore, climbed the little ascent which led to the top\nof the cliff, saluted Milady a last time, and took his course toward the\ncity.\n\nAt the end of a hundred paces, the ground began to decline, and he could\nonly see the mast of the sloop.\n\nHe immediately ran in the direction of Portsmouth, which he saw at\nnearly half a league before him, standing out in the haze of the\nmorning, with its houses and towers.\n\nBeyond Portsmouth the sea was covered with vessels whose masts, like a\nforest of poplars despoiled by the winter, bent with each breath of the\nwind.\n\nFelton, in his rapid walk, reviewed in his mind all the accusations\nagainst the favorite of James I and Charles I, furnished by two years of\npremature meditation and a long sojourn among the Puritans.\n\nWhen he compared the public crimes of this minister--startling crimes,\nEuropean crimes, if so we may say--with the private and unknown crimes\nwith which Milady had charged him, Felton found that the more culpable\nof the two men which formed the character of Buckingham was the one\nof whom the public knew not the life. This was because his love, so\nstrange, so new, and so ardent, made him view the infamous and imaginary\naccusations of Milady de Winter as, through a magnifying glass, one\nviews as frightful monsters atoms in reality imperceptible by the side\nof an ant.\n\nThe rapidity of his walk heated his blood still more; the idea that he\nleft behind him, exposed to a frightful vengeance, the woman he loved,\nor rather whom he adored as a saint, the emotion he had experienced,\npresent fatigue--all together exalted his mind above human feeling.\n\nHe entered Portsmouth about eight o'clock in the morning. The whole\npopulation was on foot; drums were beating in the streets and in the\nport; the troops about to embark were marching toward the sea.\n\nFelton arrived at the palace of the Admiralty, covered with dust, and\nstreaming with perspiration. His countenance, usually so pale, was\npurple with heat and passion. The sentinel wanted to repulse him; but\nFelton called to the officer of the post, and drawing from his pocket\nthe letter of which he was the bearer, he said, \"A pressing message from\nLord de Winter.\"\n\nAt the name of Lord de Winter, who was known to be one of his Grace's\nmost intimate friends, the officer of the post gave orders to let Felton\npass, who, besides, wore the uniform of a naval officer.\n\nFelton darted into the palace.\n\nAt the moment he entered the vestibule, another man was entering\nlikewise, dusty, out of breath, leaving at the gate a post horse, which,\non reaching the palace, tumbled on his foreknees.\n\nFelton and he addressed Patrick, the duke's confidential lackey, at the\nsame moment. Felton named Lord de Winter; the unknown would not name\nanybody, and pretended that it was to the duke alone he would make\nhimself known. Each was anxious to gain admission before the other.\n\nPatrick, who knew Lord de Winter was in affairs of the service, and in\nrelations of friendship with the duke, gave the preference to the one\nwho came in his name. The other was forced to wait, and it was easily to\nbe seen how he cursed the delay.\n\nThe valet led Felton through a large hall in which waited the deputies\nfrom La Rochelle, headed by the Prince de Soubise, and introduced him\ninto a closet where Buckingham, just out of the bath, was finishing\nhis toilet, upon which, as at all times, he bestowed extraordinary\nattention.\n\n\"Lieutenant Felton, from Lord de Winter,\" said Patrick.\n\n\"From Lord de Winter!\" repeated Buckingham; \"let him come in.\"\n\nFelton entered. At that moment Buckingham was throwing upon a couch a\nrich toilet robe, worked with gold, in order to put on a blue velvet\ndoublet embroidered with pearls.\n\n\"Why didn't the baron come himself?\" demanded Buckingham. \"I expected\nhim this morning.\"\n\n\"He desired me to tell your Grace,\" replied Felton, \"that he very much\nregretted not having that honor, but that he was prevented by the guard\nhe is obliged to keep at the castle.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know that,\" said Buckingham; \"he has a prisoner.\"\n\n\"It is of that prisoner that I wish to speak to your Grace,\" replied\nFelton.\n\n\"Well, then, speak!\"\n\n\"That which I have to say of her can only be heard by yourself, my\nLord!\"\n\n\"Leave us, Patrick,\" said Buckingham; \"but remain within sound of the\nbell. I shall call you presently.\"\n\nPatrick went out.\n\n\"We are alone, sir,\" said Buckingham; \"speak!\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" said Felton, \"the Baron de Winter wrote to you the other day\nto request you to sign an order of embarkation relative to a young woman\nnamed Charlotte Backson.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; and I answered him, to bring or send me that order and I\nwould sign it.\"\n\n\"Here it is, my Lord.\"\n\n\"Give it to me,\" said the duke.\n\nAnd taking it from Felton, he cast a rapid glance over the paper, and\nperceiving that it was the one that had been mentioned to him, he placed\nit on the table, took a pen, and prepared to sign it.\n\n\"Pardon, my Lord,\" said Felton, stopping the duke; \"but does your Grace\nknow that the name of Charlotte Backson is not the true name of this\nyoung woman?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I know it,\" replied the duke, dipping the quill in the ink.\n\n\"Then your Grace knows her real name?\" asked Felton, in a sharp tone.\n\n\"I know it\"; and the duke put the quill to the paper. Felton grew pale.\n\n\"And knowing that real name, my Lord,\" replied Felton, \"will you sign it\nall the same?\"\n\n\"Doubtless,\" said Buckingham, \"and rather twice than once.\"\n\n\"I cannot believe,\" continued Felton, in a voice that became more sharp\nand rough, \"that your Grace knows that it is to Milady de Winter this\nrelates.\"\n\n\"I know it perfectly, although I am astonished that you know it.\"\n\n\"And will your Grace sign that order without remorse?\"\n\nBuckingham looked at the young man haughtily.\n\n\"Do you know, sir, that you are asking me very strange questions, and\nthat I am very foolish to answer them?\"\n\n\"Reply to them, my Lord,\" said Felton; \"the circumstances are more\nserious than you perhaps believe.\"\n\nBuckingham reflected that the young man, coming from Lord de Winter,\nundoubtedly spoke in his name, and softened.\n\n\"Without remorse,\" said he. \"The baron knows, as well as myself, that\nMilady de Winter is a very guilty woman, and it is treating her very\nfavorably to commute her punishment to transportation.\" The duke put his\npen to the paper.\n\n\"You will not sign that order, my Lord!\" said Felton, making a step\ntoward the duke.\n\n\"I will not sign this order! And why not?\"\n\n\"Because you will look into yourself, and you will do justice to the\nlady.\"\n\n\"I should do her justice by sending her to Tyburn,\" said Buckingham.\n\"This lady is infamous.\"\n\n\"My Lord, Milady de Winter is an angel; you know that she is, and I\ndemand her liberty of you.\"\n\n\"Bah! Are you mad, to talk to me thus?\" said Buckingham.\n\n\"My Lord, excuse me! I speak as I can; I restrain myself. But, my Lord,\nthink of what you're about to do, and beware of going too far!\"\n\n\"What do you say? God pardon me!\" cried Buckingham, \"I really think he\nthreatens me!\"\n\n\"No, my Lord, I still plead. And I say to you: one drop of water\nsuffices to make the full vase overflow; one slight fault may draw down\npunishment upon the head spared, despite many crimes.\"\n\n\"Mr. Felton,\" said Buckingham, \"you will withdraw, and place yourself at\nonce under arrest.\"\n\n\"You will hear me to the end, my Lord. You have seduced this young girl;\nyou have outraged, defiled her. Repair your crimes toward her; let her\ngo free, and I will exact nothing else from you.\"\n\n\"You will exact!\" said Buckingham, looking at Felton with astonishment,\nand dwelling upon each syllable of the three words as he pronounced\nthem.\n\n\"My Lord,\" continued Felton, becoming more excited as he spoke, \"my\nLord, beware! All England is tired of your iniquities; my Lord, you have\nabused the royal power, which you have almost usurped; my Lord, you are\nheld in horror by God and men. God will punish you hereafter, but I will\npunish you here!\"\n\n\"Ah, this is too much!\" cried Buckingham, making a step toward the door.\n\nFelton barred his passage.\n\n\"I ask it humbly of you, my Lord,\" said he; \"sign the order for the\nliberation of Milady de Winter. Remember that she is a woman whom you\nhave dishonored.\"\n\n\"Withdraw, sir,\" said Buckingham, \"or I will call my attendant, and have\nyou placed in irons.\"\n\n\"You shall not call,\" said Felton, throwing himself between the duke and\nthe bell placed on a stand encrusted with silver. \"Beware, my Lord, you\nare in the hands of God!\"\n\n\"In the hands of the devil, you mean!\" cried Buckingham, raising his\nvoice so as to attract the notice of his people, without absolutely\nshouting.\n\n\"Sign, my Lord; sign the liberation of Milady de Winter,\" said Felton,\nholding out a paper to the duke.\n\n\"By force? You are joking! Holloa, Patrick!\"\n\n\"Sign, my Lord!\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Never?\"\n\n\"Help!\" shouted the duke; and at the same time he sprang toward his\nsword.\n\nBut Felton did not give him time to draw it. He held the knife with\nwhich Milady had stabbed herself, open in his bosom; at one bound he was\nupon the duke.\n\nAt that moment Patrick entered the room, crying, \"A letter from France,\nmy Lord.\"\n\n\"From France!\" cried Buckingham, forgetting everything in thinking from\nwhom that letter came.\n\nFelton took advantage of this moment, and plunged the knife into his\nside up to the handle.\n\n\"Ah, traitor,\" cried Buckingham, \"you have killed me!\"\n\n\"Murder!\" screamed Patrick.\n\nFelton cast his eyes round for means of escape, and seeing the door\nfree, he rushed into the next chamber, in which, as we have said,\nthe deputies from La Rochelle were waiting, crossed it as quickly as\npossible, and rushed toward the staircase; but upon the first step he\nmet Lord de Winter, who, seeing him pale, confused, livid, and stained\nwith blood both on his hands and face, seized him by the throat,\ncrying, \"I knew it! I guessed it! But too late by a minute, unfortunate,\nunfortunate that I am!\"\n\nFelton made no resistance. Lord de Winter placed him in the hands of the\nguards, who led him, while awaiting further orders, to a little terrace\ncommanding the sea; and then the baron hastened to the duke's chamber.\n\nAt the cry uttered by the duke and the scream of Patrick, the man whom\nFelton had met in the antechamber rushed into the chamber.\n\nHe found the duke reclining upon a sofa, with his hand pressed upon the\nwound.\n\n\"Laporte,\" said the duke, in a dying voice, \"Laporte, do you come from\nher?\"\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur,\" replied the faithful cloak bearer of Anne of\nAustria, \"but too late, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Silence, Laporte, you may be overheard. Patrick, let no one enter. Oh,\nI cannot tell what she says to me! My God, I am dying!\"\n\nAnd the duke swooned.\n\nMeanwhile, Lord de Winter, the deputies, the leaders of the expedition,\nthe officers of Buckingham's household, had all made their way into the\nchamber. Cries of despair resounded on all sides. The news, which filled\nthe palace with tears and groans, soon became known, and spread itself\nthroughout the city.\n\nThe report of a cannon announced that something new and unexpected had\ntaken place.\n\nLord de Winter tore his hair.\n\n\"Too late by a minute!\" cried he, \"too late by a minute! Oh, my God, my\nGod! what a misfortune!\"\n\nHe had been informed at seven o'clock in the morning that a rope ladder\nfloated from one of the windows of the castle; he had hastened to\nMilady's chamber, had found it empty, the window open, and the bars\nfiled, had remembered the verbal caution d'Artagnan had transmitted\nto him by his messenger, had trembled for the duke, and running to the\nstable without taking time to have a horse saddled, had jumped upon the\nfirst he found, had galloped off like the wind, had alighted below in\nthe courtyard, had ascended the stairs precipitately, and on the top\nstep, as we have said, had encountered Felton.\n\nThe duke, however, was not dead. He recovered a little, reopened his\neyes, and hope revived in all hearts.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"leave me alone with Patrick and Laporte--ah, is\nthat you, de Winter? You sent me a strange madman this morning! See the\nstate in which he has put me.\"\n\n\"Oh, my Lord!\" cried the baron, \"I shall never console myself.\"\n\n\"And you would be quite wrong, my dear de Winter,\" said Buckingham,\nholding out his hand to him. \"I do not know the man who deserves being\nregretted during the whole life of another man; but leave us, I pray\nyou.\"\n\nThe baron went out sobbing.\n\nThere only remained in the closet of the wounded duke Laporte and\nPatrick. A physician was sought for, but none was yet found.\n\n\"You will live, my Lord, you will live!\" repeated the faithful servant\nof Anne of Austria, on his knees before the duke's sofa.\n\n\"What has she written to me?\" said Buckingham, feebly, streaming with\nblood, and suppressing his agony to speak of her he loved, \"what has she\nwritten to me? Read me her letter.\"\n\n\"Oh, my Lord!\" said Laporte.\n\n\"Obey, Laporte, do you not see I have no time to lose?\"\n\nLaporte broke the seal, and placed the paper before the eyes of the\nduke; but Buckingham in vain tried to make out the writing.\n\n\"Read!\" said he, \"read! I cannot see. Read, then! For soon, perhaps, I\nshall not hear, and I shall die without knowing what she has written to\nme.\"\n\nLaporte made no further objection, and read:\n\n\n\"My Lord, By that which, since I have known you, have suffered by you\nand for you, I conjure you, if you have any care for my repose, to\ncountermand those great armaments which you are preparing against\nFrance, to put an end to a war of which it is publicly said religion is\nthe ostensible cause, and of which, it is generally whispered, your\nlove for me is the concealed cause. This war may not only bring great\ncatastrophes upon England and France, but misfortune upon you, my Lord,\nfor which I should never console myself.\n\n\"Be careful of your life, which is menaced, and which will be dear to me\nfrom the moment I am not obliged to see an enemy in you.\n\n\"Your affectionate\n\n\"ANNE\"\n\n\nBuckingham collected all his remaining strength to listen to the reading\nof the letter; then, when it was ended, as if he had met with a bitter\ndisappointment, he asked, \"Have you nothing else to say to me by the\nliving voice, Laporte?\"\n\n\"The queen charged me to tell you to watch over yourself, for she had\nadvice that your assassination would be attempted.\"\n\n\"And is that all--is that all?\" replied Buckingham, impatiently.\n\n\"She likewise charged me to tell you that she still loved you.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Buckingham, \"God be praised! My death, then, will not be to\nher as the death of a stranger!\"\n\nLaporte burst into tears.\n\n\"Patrick,\" said the due, \"bring me the casket in which the diamond studs\nwere kept.\"\n\nPatrick brought the object desired, which Laporte recognized as having\nbelonged to the queen.\n\n\"Now the scent bag of white satin, on which her cipher is embroidered in\npearls.\"\n\nPatrick again obeyed.\n\n\"Here, Laporte,\" said Buckingham, \"these are the only tokens I ever\nreceived from her--this silver casket and these two letters. You will\nrestore them to her Majesty; and as a last memorial\"--he looked round\nfor some valuable object--\"you will add--\"\n\nHe still sought; but his eyes, darkened by death, encountered only the\nknife which had fallen from the hand of Felton, still smoking with the\nblood spread over its blade.\n\n\"And you will add to them this knife,\" said the duke, pressing the hand\nof Laporte. He had just strength enough to place the scent bag at the\nbottom of the silver casket, and to let the knife fall into it, making\na sign to Laporte that he was no longer able to speak; than, in a last\nconvulsion, which this time he had not the power to combat, he slipped\nfrom the sofa to the floor.\n\nPatrick uttered a loud cry.\n\nBuckingham tried to smile a last time; but death checked his thought,\nwhich remained engraved on his brow like a last kiss of love.\n\nAt this moment the duke's surgeon arrived, quite terrified; he was\nalready on board the admiral's ship, where they had been obliged to seek\nhim.\n\nHe approached the duke, took his hand, held it for an instant in his\nown, and letting it fall, \"All is useless,\" said he, \"he is dead.\"\n\n\"Dead, dead!\" cried Patrick.\n\nAt this cry all the crowd re-entered the apartment, and throughout the\npalace and town there was nothing but consternation and tumult.\n\nAs soon as Lord de Winter saw Buckingham was dead, he ran to Felton,\nwhom the soldiers still guarded on the terrace of the palace.\n\n\"Wretch!\" said he to the young man, who since the death of Buckingham\nhad regained that coolness and self-possession which never after\nabandoned him, \"wretch! what have you done?\"\n\n\"I have avenged myself!\" said he.\n\n\"Avenged yourself,\" said the baron. \"Rather say that you have served as\nan instrument to that accursed woman; but I swear to you that this crime\nshall be her last.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" replied Felton, quietly, \"and I am\nignorant of whom you are speaking, my Lord. I killed the Duke of\nBuckingham because he twice refused you yourself to appoint me captain;\nI have punished him for his injustice, that is all.\"\n\nDe Winter, stupefied, looked on while the soldiers bound Felton, and\ncould not tell what to think of such insensibility.\n\nOne thing alone, however, threw a shade over the pallid brow of Felton.\nAt every noise he heard, the simple Puritan fancied he recognized the\nstep and voice of Milady coming to throw herself into his arms, to\naccuse herself, and die with him.\n\nAll at once he started. His eyes became fixed upon a point of the sea,\ncommanded by the terrace where he was. With the eagle glance of a sailor\nhe had recognized there, where another would have seen only a gull\nhovering over the waves, the sail of a sloop which was directed toward\nthe cost of France.\n\nHe grew deadly pale, placed his hand upon his heart, which was breaking,\nand at once perceived all the treachery.\n\n\"One last favor, my Lord!\" said he to the baron.\n\n\"What?\" asked his Lordship.\n\n\"What o'clock is it?\"\n\nThe baron drew out his watch. \"It wants ten minutes to nine,\" said he.\n\nMilady had hastened her departure by an hour and a half. As soon as she\nheard the cannon which announced the fatal event, she had ordered the\nanchor to be weighed. The vessel was making way under a blue sky, at\ngreat distance from the coast.\n\n\"God has so willed it!\" said he, with the resignation of a fanatic; but\nwithout, however, being able to take his eyes from that ship, on board\nof which he doubtless fancied he could distinguish the white outline of\nher to whom he had sacrificed his life.\n\nDe Winter followed his look, observed his feelings, and guessed all.\n\n\"Be punished ALONE, for the first, miserable man!\" said Lord de Winter\nto Felton, who was being dragged away with his eyes turned toward the\nsea; \"but I swear to you by the memory of my brother whom I have loved\nso much that your accomplice is not saved.\"\n\nFelton lowered his head without pronouncing a syllable.\n\nAs to Lord de Winter, he descended the stairs rapidly, and went straight\nto the port.\n\n\n\n\n60 IN FRANCE\n\nThe first fear of the King of England, Charles I, on learning of the\ndeath of the duke, was that such terrible news might discourage the\nRochellais; he tried, says Richelieu in his Memoirs, to conceal it from\nthem as long as possible, closing all the ports of his kingdom, and\ncarefully keeping watch that no vessel should sail until the army\nwhich Buckingham was getting together had gone, taking upon himself, in\ndefault of Buckingham, to superintend the departure.\n\nHe carried the strictness of this order so far as to detain in England\nthe ambassadors of Denmark, who had taken their leave, and the regular\nambassador of Holland, who was to take back to the port of Flushing the\nIndian merchantmen of which Charles I had made restitution to the United\nProvinces.\n\nBut as he did not think of giving this order till five hours after the\nevent--that is to say, till two o'clock in the afternoon--two vessels\nhad already left the port, the one bearing, as we know, Milady, who,\nalready anticipating the event, was further confirmed in that belief by\nseeing the black flag flying at the masthead of the admiral's ship.\n\nAs to the second vessel, we will tell hereafter whom it carried, and how\nit set sail.\n\nDuring this time nothing new occurred in the camp at La Rochelle; only\nthe king, who was bored, as always, but perhaps a little more so in camp\nthan elsewhere, resolved to go incognito and spend the festival of St.\nLouis at St. Germain, and asked the cardinal to order him an escort of\nonly twenty Musketeers. The cardinal, who sometimes became weary of the\nking, granted this leave of absence with great pleasure to his royal\nlieutenant, who promised to return about the fifteenth of September.\n\nM. de Treville, being informed of this by his Eminence, packed his\nportmanteau; and as without knowing the cause he knew the great desire\nand even imperative need which his friends had of returning to Paris, it\ngoes without saying that he fixed upon them to form part of the escort.\n\nThe four young men heard the news a quarter of an hour after M. de\nTreville, for they were the first to whom he communicated it. It was\nthen that d'Artagnan appreciated the favor the cardinal had conferred\nupon him in making him at last enter the Musketeers--for without that\ncircumstance he would have been forced to remain in the camp while his\ncompanions left it.\n\nIt goes without saying that this impatience to return toward Paris had\nfor a cause the danger which Mme. Bonacieux would run of meeting at the\nconvent of Bethune with Milady, her mortal enemy. Aramis therefore had\nwritten immediately to Marie Michon, the seamstress at Tours who had\nsuch fine acquaintances, to obtain from the queen authority for Mme.\nBonacieux to leave the convent, and to retire either into Lorraine or\nBelgium. They had not long to wait for an answer. Eight or ten days\nafterward Aramis received the following letter:\n\n\nMy Dear Cousin, Here is the authorization from my sister to withdraw our\nlittle servant from the convent of Bethune, the air of which you think\nis bad for her. My sister sends you this authorization with great\npleasure, for she is very partial to the little girl, to whom she\nintends to be more serviceable hereafter.\n\nI salute you,\n\nMARIE MICHON\n\n\nTo this letter was added an order, conceived in these terms:\n\n\nAt the Louvre, August 10, 1628 The superior of the convent of Bethune\nwill place in the hands of the person who shall present this note to her\nthe novice who entered the convent upon my recommendation and under my\npatronage.\n\nANNE\n\n\nIt may be easily imagined how the relationship between Aramis and a\nseamstress who called the queen her sister amused the young men; but\nAramis, after having blushed two or three times up to the whites of\nhis eyes at the gross pleasantry of Porthos, begged his friends not to\nrevert to the subject again, declaring that if a single word more\nwas said to him about it, he would never again implore his cousins to\ninterfere in such affairs.\n\nThere was no further question, therefore, about Marie Michon among the\nfour Musketeers, who besides had what they wanted: that was, the\norder to withdraw Mme. Bonacieux from the convent of the Carmelites of\nBethune. It was true that this order would not be of great use to them\nwhile they were in camp at La Rochelle; that is to say, at the other end\nof France. Therefore d'Artagnan was going to ask leave of absence of M.\nde Treville, confiding to him candidly the importance of his departure,\nwhen the news was transmitted to him as well as to his three friends\nthat the king was about to set out for Paris with an escort of twenty\nMusketeers, and that they formed part of the escort.\n\nTheir joy was great. The lackeys were sent on before with the baggage,\nand they set out on the morning of the sixteenth.\n\nThe cardinal accompanied his Majesty from Surgeres to Mauzes; and\nthere the king and his minister took leave of each other with great\ndemonstrations of friendship.\n\nThe king, however, who sought distraction, while traveling as fast as\npossible--for he was anxious to be in Paris by the twenty-third--stopped\nfrom time to time to fly the magpie, a pastime for which the taste had\nbeen formerly inspired in him by de Luynes, and for which he had always\npreserved a great predilection. Out of the twenty Musketeers sixteen,\nwhen this took place, rejoiced greatly at this relaxation; but the other\nfour cursed it heartily. D'Artagnan, in particular, had a perpetual\nbuzzing in his ears, which Porthos explained thus: \"A very great lady\nhas told me that this means that somebody is talking of you somewhere.\"\n\nAt length the escort passed through Paris on the twenty-third, in the\nnight. The king thanked M. de Treville, and permitted him to distribute\nfurloughs for four days, on condition that the favored parties should\nnot appear in any public place, under penalty of the Bastille.\n\nThe first four furloughs granted, as may be imagined, were to our\nfour friends. Still further, Athos obtained of M. de Treville six days\ninstead of four, and introduced into these six days two more nights--for\nthey set out on the twenty-fourth at five o'clock in the evening, and as\na further kindness M. de Treville post-dated the leave to the morning of\nthe twenty-fifth.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" said d'Artagnan, who, as we have often said, never stumbled\nat anything. \"It appears to me that we are making a great trouble of\na very simple thing. In two days, and by using up two or three horses\n(that's nothing; I have plenty of money), I am at Bethune. I present\nmy letter from the queen to the superior, and I bring back the dear\ntreasure I go to seek--not into Lorraine, not into Belgium, but to\nParis, where she will be much better concealed, particularly while the\ncardinal is at La Rochelle. Well, once returned from the country, half\nby the protection of her cousin, half through what we have personally\ndone for her, we shall obtain from the queen what we desire. Remain,\nthen, where you are, and do not exhaust yourselves with useless fatigue.\nMyself and Planchet are all that such a simple expedition requires.\"\n\nTo this Athos replied quietly: \"We also have money left--for I have not\nyet drunk all my share of the diamond, and Porthos and Aramis have not\neaten all theirs. We can therefore use up four horses as well as one.\nBut consider, d'Artagnan,\" added he, in a tone so solemn that it made\nthe young man shudder, \"consider that Bethune is a city where the\ncardinal has given rendezvous to a woman who, wherever she goes, brings\nmisery with her. If you had only to deal with four men, d'Artagnan, I\nwould allow you to go alone. You have to do with that woman! We four\nwill go; and I hope to God that with our four lackeys we may be in\nsufficient number.\"\n\n\"You terrify me, Athos!\" cried d'Artagnan. \"My God! what do you fear?\"\n\n\"Everything!\" replied Athos.\n\nD'Artagnan examined the countenances of his companions, which, like that\nof Athos, wore an impression of deep anxiety; and they continued their\nroute as fast as their horses could carry them, but without adding\nanother word.\n\nOn the evening of the twenty-fifth, as they were entering Arras, and as\nd'Artagnan was dismounting at the inn of the Golden Harrow to drink a\nglass of wine, a horseman came out of the post yard, where he had just\nhad a relay, started off at a gallop, and with a fresh horse took the\nroad to Paris. At the moment he passed through the gateway into the\nstreet, the wind blew open the cloak in which he was wrapped, although\nit was in the month of August, and lifted his hat, which the traveler\nseized with his hand the moment it had left his head, pulling it eagerly\nover his eyes.\n\nD'Artagnan, who had his eyes fixed upon this man, became very pale, and\nlet his glass fall.\n\n\"What is the matter, monsieur?\" said Planchet. \"Oh, come, gentlemen, my\nmaster is ill!\"\n\nThe three friends hastened toward d'Artagnan, who, instead of being ill,\nran toward his horse. They stopped him at the door.\n\n\"Well, where the devil are you going now?\" cried Athos.\n\n\"It is he!\" cried d'Artagnan, pale with anger, and with the sweat on his\nbrow, \"it is he! let me overtake him!\"\n\n\"He? What he?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"He, that man!\"\n\n\"What man?\"\n\n\"That cursed man, my evil genius, whom I have always met with when\nthreatened by some misfortune, he who accompanied that horrible woman\nwhen I met her for the first time, he whom I was seeking when I offended\nour Athos, he whom I saw on the very morning Madame Bonacieux was\nabducted. I have seen him; that is he! I recognized him when the wind\nblew upon his cloak.\"\n\n\"The devil!\" said Athos, musingly.\n\n\"To saddle, gentlemen! to saddle! Let us pursue him, and we shall\novertake him!\"\n\n\"My dear friend,\" said Aramis, \"remember that he goes in an opposite\ndirection from that in which we are going, that he has a fresh horse,\nand ours are fatigued, so that we shall disable our own horses without\neven a chance of overtaking him. Let the man go, d'Artagnan; let us save\nthe woman.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, monsieur!\" cried a hostler, running out and looking after the\nstranger, \"monsieur, here is a paper which dropped out of your hat! Eh,\nmonsieur, eh!\"\n\n\"Friend,\" said d'Artagnan, \"a half-pistole for that paper!\"\n\n\"My faith, monsieur, with great pleasure! Here it is!\"\n\nThe hostler, enchanted with the good day's work he had done, returned to\nthe yard. D'Artagnan unfolded the paper.\n\n\"Well?\" eagerly demanded all his three friends.\n\n\"Nothing but one word!\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Aramis, \"but that one word is the name of some town or\nvillage.\"\n\n\"Armentieres,\" read Porthos; \"Armentieres? I don't know such a place.\"\n\n\"And that name of a town or village is written in her hand!\" cried\nAthos.\n\n\"Come on, come on!\" said d'Artagnan; \"let us keep that paper carefully,\nperhaps I have not thrown away my half-pistole. To horse, my friends, to\nhorse!\"\n\nAnd the four friends flew at a gallop along the road to Bethune.\n\n\n\n\n61 THE CARMELITE CONVENT AT BETHUNE\n\nGreat criminals bear about them a kind of predestination which makes\nthem surmount all obstacles, which makes them escape all dangers, up to\nthe moment which a wearied Providence has marked as the rock of their\nimpious fortunes.\n\nIt was thus with Milady. She escaped the cruisers of both nations, and\narrived at Boulogne without accident.\n\nWhen landing at Portsmouth, Milady was an Englishwoman whom the\npersecutions of the French drove from La Rochelle; when landing at\nBoulogne, after a two days' passage, she passed for a Frenchwoman whom\nthe English persecuted at Portsmouth out of their hatred for France.\n\nMilady had, likewise, the best of passports--her beauty, her noble\nappearance, and the liberality with which she distributed her pistoles.\nFreed from the usual formalities by the affable smile and gallant\nmanners of an old governor of the port, who kissed her hand, she\nonly remained long enough at Boulogne to put into the post a letter,\nconceived in the following terms:\n\n\n\"To his Eminence Monseigneur the Cardinal Richelieu, in his camp before\nLa Rochelle.\n\n\"Monseigneur, Let your Eminence be reassured. His Grace the Duke of\nBuckingham WILL NOT SET OUT for France.\n\n\"MILADY DE ----\n\n\"BOULOGNE, evening of the twenty-fifth.\n\n\"P.S.--According to the desire of your Eminence, I report to the convent\nof the Carmelites at Bethune, where I will await your orders.\"\n\n\nAccordingly, that same evening Milady commenced her journey. Night\novertook her; she stopped, and slept at an inn. At five o'clock the next\nmorning she again proceeded, and in three hours after entered Bethune.\nShe inquired for the convent of the Carmelites, and went thither\nimmediately.\n\nThe superior met her; Milady showed her the cardinal's order. The abbess\nassigned her a chamber, and had breakfast served.\n\nAll the past was effaced from the eyes of this woman; and her looks,\nfixed on the future, beheld nothing but the high fortunes reserved for\nher by the cardinal, whom she had so successfully served without his\nname being in any way mixed up with the sanguinary affair. The ever-new\npassions which consumed her gave to her life the appearance of those\nclouds which float in the heavens, reflecting sometimes azure, sometimes\nfire, sometimes the opaque blackness of the tempest, and which leave no\ntraces upon the earth behind them but devastation and death.\n\nAfter breakfast, the abbess came to pay her a visit. There is very\nlittle amusement in the cloister, and the good superior was eager to\nmake the acquaintance of her new boarder.\n\nMilady wished to please the abbess. This was a very easy matter for a\nwoman so really superior as she was. She tried to be agreeable, and she\nwas charming, winning the good superior by her varied conversation and\nby the graces of her whole personality.\n\nThe abbess, who was the daughter of a noble house, took particular\ndelight in stories of the court, which so seldom travel to the\nextremities of the kingdom, and which, above all, have so much\ndifficulty in penetrating the walls of convents, at whose threshold the\nnoise of the world dies away.\n\nMilady, on the contrary, was quite conversant with all aristocratic\nintrigues, amid which she had constantly lived for five or six years.\nShe made it her business, therefore, to amuse the good abbess with\nthe worldly practices of the court of France, mixed with the eccentric\npursuits of the king; she made for her the scandalous chronicle of the\nlords and ladies of the court, whom the abbess knew perfectly by name,\ntouched lightly on the amours of the queen and the Duke of Buckingham,\ntalking a great deal to induce her auditor to talk a little.\n\nBut the abbess contented herself with listening and smiling without\nreplying a word. Milady, however, saw that this sort of narrative amused\nher very much, and kept at it; only she now let her conversation drift\ntoward the cardinal.\n\nBut she was greatly embarrassed. She did not know whether the abbess was\na royalist or a cardinalist; she therefore confined herself to a prudent\nmiddle course. But the abbess, on her part, maintained a reserve still\nmore prudent, contenting herself with making a profound inclination\nof the head every time the fair traveler pronounced the name of his\nEminence.\n\nMilady began to think she should soon grow weary of a convent life; she\nresolved, then, to risk something in order that she might know how to\nact afterward. Desirous of seeing how far the discretion of the good\nabbess would go, she began to tell a story, obscure at first, but very\ncircumstantial afterward, about the cardinal, relating the amours of the\nminister with Mme. d'Aiguillon, Marion de Lorme, and several other gay\nwomen.\n\nThe abbess listened more attentively, grew animated by degrees, and\nsmiled.\n\n\"Good,\" thought Milady; \"she takes a pleasure in my conversation. If she\nis a cardinalist, she has no fanaticism, at least.\"\n\nShe then went on to describe the persecutions exercised by the cardinal\nupon his enemies. The abbess only crossed herself, without approving or\ndisapproving.\n\nThis confirmed Milady in her opinion that the abbess was rather royalist\nthan cardinalist. Milady therefore continued, coloring her narrations\nmore and more.\n\n\"I am very ignorant of these matters,\" said the abbess, at length;\n\"but however distant from the court we may be, however remote from the\ninterests of the world we may be placed, we have very sad examples of\nwhat you have related. And one of our boarders has suffered much from\nthe vengeance and persecution of the cardinal!\"\n\n\"One of your boarders?\" said Milady; \"oh, my God! Poor woman! I pity\nher, then.\"\n\n\"And you have reason, for she is much to be pitied. Imprisonment,\nmenaces, ill treatment-she has suffered everything. But after all,\"\nresumed the abbess, \"Monsieur Cardinal has perhaps plausible motives for\nacting thus; and though she has the look of an angel, we must not always\njudge people by the appearance.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Milady to herself; \"who knows! I am about, perhaps, to\ndiscover something here; I am in the vein.\"\n\nShe tried to give her countenance an appearance of perfect candor.\n\n\"Alas,\" said Milady, \"I know it is so. It is said that we must not trust\nto the face; but in what, then, shall we place confidence, if not in the\nmost beautiful work of the Lord? As for me, I shall be deceived all\nmy life perhaps, but I shall always have faith in a person whose\ncountenance inspires me with sympathy.\"\n\n\"You would, then, be tempted to believe,\" said the abbess, \"that this\nyoung person is innocent?\"\n\n\"The cardinal pursues not only crimes,\" said she: \"there are certain\nvirtues which he pursues more severely than certain offenses.\"\n\n\"Permit me, madame, to express my surprise,\" said the abbess.\n\n\"At what?\" said Milady, with the utmost ingenuousness.\n\n\"At the language you use.\"\n\n\"What do you find so astonishing in that language?\" said Milady,\nsmiling.\n\n\"You are the friend of the cardinal, for he sends you hither, and yet--\"\n\n\"And yet I speak ill of him,\" replied Milady, finishing the thought of\nthe superior.\n\n\"At least you don't speak well of him.\"\n\n\"That is because I am not his friend,\" said she, sighing, \"but his\nvictim!\"\n\n\"But this letter in which he recommends you to me?\"\n\n\"Is an order for me to confine myself to a sort of prison, from which he\nwill release me by one of his satellites.\"\n\n\"But why have you not fled?\"\n\n\"Whither should I go? Do you believe there is a spot on the earth which\nthe cardinal cannot reach if he takes the trouble to stretch forth his\nhand? If I were a man, that would barely be possible; but what can a\nwoman do? This young boarder of yours, has she tried to fly?\"\n\n\"No, that is true; but she--that is another thing; I believe she is\ndetained in France by some love affair.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Milady, with a sigh, \"if she loves she is not altogether\nwretched.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said the abbess, looking at Milady with increasing interest, \"I\nbehold another poor victim?\"\n\n\"Alas, yes,\" said Milady.\n\nThe abbess looked at her for an instant with uneasiness, as if a fresh\nthought suggested itself to her mind.\n\n\"You are not an enemy of our holy faith?\" said she, hesitatingly.\n\n\"Who--I?\" cried Milady; \"I a Protestant? Oh, no! I call to witness the\nGod who hears us, that on the contrary I am a fervent Catholic!\"\n\n\"Then, madame,\" said the abbess, smiling, \"be reassured; the house in\nwhich you are shall not be a very hard prison, and we will do all in our\npower to make you cherish your captivity. You will find here, moreover,\nthe young woman of whom I spoke, who is persecuted, no doubt, in\nconsequence of some court intrigue. She is amiable and well-behaved.\"\n\n\"What is her name?\"\n\n\"She was sent to me by someone of high rank, under the name of Kitty. I\nhave not tried to discover her other name.\"\n\n\"Kitty!\" cried Milady. \"What? Are you sure?\"\n\n\"That she is called so? Yes, madame. Do you know her?\"\n\nMilady smiled to herself at the idea which had occurred to her that this\nmight be her old chambermaid. There was connected with the remembrance\nof this girl a remembrance of anger; and a desire of vengeance\ndisordered the features of Milady, which, however, immediately recovered\nthe calm and benevolent expression which this woman of a hundred faces\nhad for a moment allowed them to lose.\n\n\"And when can I see this young lady, for whom I already feel so great a\nsympathy?\" asked Milady.\n\n\"Why, this evening,\" said the abbess; \"today even. But you have been\ntraveling these four days, as you told me yourself. This morning you\nrose at five o'clock; you must stand in need of repose. Go to bed and\nsleep; at dinnertime we will rouse you.\"\n\nAlthough Milady would very willingly have gone without sleep, sustained\nas she was by all the excitements which a new adventure awakened in her\nheart, ever thirsting for intrigues, she nevertheless accepted the offer\nof the superior. During the last fifteen days she had experienced so\nmany and such various emotions that if her frame of iron was still\ncapable of supporting fatigue, her mind required repose.\n\nShe therefore took leave of the abbess, and went to bed, softly rocked\nby the ideas of vengeance which the name of Kitty had naturally brought\nto her thoughts. She remembered that almost unlimited promise which\nthe cardinal had given her if she succeeded in her enterprise. She had\nsucceeded; d'Artagnan was then in her power!\n\nOne thing alone frightened her; that was the remembrance of her\nhusband, the Comte de la Fere, whom she had believed dead, or at least\nexpatriated, and whom she found again in Athos-the best friend of\nd'Artagnan.\n\nBut alas, if he was the friend of d'Artagnan, he must have lent him his\nassistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated\nthe project of his Eminence; if he was the friend of d'Artagnan, he was\nthe enemy of the cardinal; and she doubtless would succeed in involving\nhim in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young Musketeer.\n\nAll these hopes were so many sweet thoughts for Milady; so, rocked by\nthem, she soon fell asleep.\n\nShe was awakened by a soft voice which sounded at the foot of her bed.\nShe opened her eyes, and saw the abbess, accompanied by a young woman\nwith light hair and delicate complexion, who fixed upon her a look full\nof benevolent curiosity.\n\nThe face of the young woman was entirely unknown to her. Each examined\nthe other with great attention, while exchanging the customary\ncompliments; both were very handsome, but of quite different styles of\nbeauty. Milady, however, smiled in observing that she excelled the young\nwoman by far in her high air and aristocratic bearing. It is true\nthat the habit of a novice, which the young woman wore, was not very\nadvantageous in a contest of this kind.\n\nThe abbess introduced them to each other. When this formality was ended,\nas her duties called her to chapel, she left the two young women alone.\n\nThe novice, seeing Milady in bed, was about to follow the example of the\nsuperior; but Milady stopped her.\n\n\"How, madame,\" said she, \"I have scarcely seen you, and you already wish\nto deprive me of your company, upon which I had counted a little, I must\nconfess, for the time I have to pass here?\"\n\n\"No, madame,\" replied the novice, \"only I thought I had chosen my time\nill; you were asleep, you are fatigued.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Milady, \"what can those who sleep wish for--a happy\nawakening? This awakening you have given me; allow me, then, to enjoy\nit at my ease,\" and taking her hand, she drew her toward the armchair by\nthe bedside.\n\nThe novice sat down.\n\n\"How unfortunate I am!\" said she; \"I have been here six months without\nthe shadow of recreation. You arrive, and your presence was likely to\nafford me delightful company; yet I expect, in all probability, to quit\nthe convent at any moment.\"\n\n\"How, you are going soon?\" asked Milady.\n\n\"At least I hope so,\" said the novice, with an expression of joy which\nshe made no effort to disguise.\n\n\"I think I learned you had suffered persecutions from the cardinal,\"\ncontinued Milady; \"that would have been another motive for sympathy\nbetween us.\"\n\n\"What I have heard, then, from our good mother is true; you have\nlikewise been a victim of that wicked priest.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Milady; \"let us not, even here, speak thus of him. All my\nmisfortunes arise from my having said nearly what you have said before\na woman whom I thought my friend, and who betrayed me. Are you also the\nvictim of a treachery?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the novice, \"but of my devotion--of a devotion to a woman I\nloved, for whom I would have laid down my life, for whom I would give it\nstill.\"\n\n\"And who has abandoned you--is that it?\"\n\n\"I have been sufficiently unjust to believe so; but during the last two\nor three days I have obtained proof to the contrary, for which I thank\nGod--for it would have cost me very dear to think she had forgotten me.\nBut you, madame, you appear to be free,\" continued the novice; \"and if\nyou were inclined to fly it only rests with yourself to do so.\"\n\n\"Whither would you have me go, without friends, without money, in a\npart of France with which I am unacquainted, and where I have never been\nbefore?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" cried the novice, \"as to friends, you would have them wherever you\nwant, you appear so good and are so beautiful!\"\n\n\"That does not prevent,\" replied Milady, softening her smile so as to\ngive it an angelic expression, \"my being alone or being persecuted.\"\n\n\"Hear me,\" said the novice; \"we must trust in heaven. There always comes\na moment when the good you have done pleads your cause before God; and\nsee, perhaps it is a happiness for you, humble and powerless as I\nam, that you have met with me, for if I leave this place, well-I have\npowerful friends, who, after having exerted themselves on my account,\nmay also exert themselves for you.\"\n\n\"Oh, when I said I was alone,\" said Milady, hoping to make the novice\ntalk by talking of herself, \"it is not for want of friends in high\nplaces; but these friends themselves tremble before the cardinal. The\nqueen herself does not dare to oppose the terrible minister. I have\nproof that her Majesty, notwithstanding her excellent heart, has more\nthan once been obliged to abandon to the anger of his Eminence persons\nwho had served her.\"\n\n\"Trust me, madame; the queen may appear to have abandoned those persons,\nbut we must not put faith in appearances. The more they are persecuted,\nthe more she thinks of them; and often, when they least expect it, they\nhave proof of a kind remembrance.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" said Milady, \"I believe so; the queen is so good!\"\n\n\"Oh, you know her, then, that lovely and noble queen, that you speak of\nher thus!\" cried the novice, with enthusiasm.\n\n\"That is to say,\" replied Milady, driven into her entrenchment, \"that I\nhave not the honor of knowing her personally; but I know a great number\nof her most intimate friends. I am acquainted with Monsieur de Putange;\nI met Monsieur Dujart in England; I know Monsieur de Treville.\"\n\n\"Monsieur de Treville!\" exclaimed the novice, \"do you know Monsieur de\nTreville?\"\n\n\"Yes, perfectly well--intimately even.\"\n\n\"The captain of the king's Musketeers?\"\n\n\"The captain of the king's Musketeers.\"\n\n\"Why, then, only see!\" cried the novice; \"we shall soon be well\nacquainted, almost friends. If you know Monsieur de Treville, you must\nhave visited him?\"\n\n\"Often!\" said Milady, who, having entered this track, and perceiving\nthat falsehood succeeded, was determined to follow it to the end.\n\n\"With him, then, you must have seen some of his Musketeers?\"\n\n\"All those he is in the habit of receiving!\" replied Milady, for whom\nthis conversation began to have a real interest.\n\n\"Name a few of those whom you know, and you will see if they are my\nfriends.\"\n\n\"Well!\" said Milady, embarrassed, \"I know Monsieur de Louvigny, Monsieur\nde Courtivron, Monsieur de Ferussac.\"\n\nThe novice let her speak, then seeing that she paused, she said, \"Don't\nyou know a gentleman named Athos?\"\n\nMilady became as pale as the sheets in which she was lying, and mistress\nas she was of herself, could not help uttering a cry, seizing the hand\nof the novice, and devouring her with looks.\n\n\"What is the matter? Good God!\" asked the poor woman, \"have I said\nanything that has wounded you?\"\n\n\"No; but the name struck me, because I also have known that gentleman,\nand it appeared strange to me to meet with a person who appears to know\nhim well.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, very well; not only him, but some of his friends, Messieurs\nPorthos and Aramis!\"\n\n\"Indeed! you know them likewise? I know them,\" cried Milady, who began\nto feel a chill penetrate her heart.\n\n\"Well, if you know them, you know that they are good and free\ncompanions. Why do you not apply to them, if you stand in need of help?\"\n\n\"That is to say,\" stammered Milady, \"I am not really very intimate\nwith any of them. I know them from having heard one of their friends,\nMonsieur d'Artagnan, say a great deal about them.\"\n\n\"You know Monsieur d'Artagnan!\" cried the novice, in her turn seizing\nthe hands of Milady and devouring her with her eyes.\n\nThen remarking the strange expression of Milady's countenance, she said,\n\"Pardon me, madame; you know him by what title?\"\n\n\"Why,\" replied Milady, embarrassed, \"why, by the title of friend.\"\n\n\"You deceive me, madame,\" said the novice; \"you have been his mistress!\"\n\n\"It is you who have been his mistress, madame!\" cried Milady, in her\nturn.\n\n\"I?\" said the novice.\n\n\"Yes, you! I know you now. You are Madame Bonacieux!\"\n\nThe young woman drew back, filled with surprise and terror.\n\n\"Oh, do not deny it! Answer!\" continued Milady.\n\n\"Well, yes, madame,\" said the novice, \"Are we rivals?\"\n\nThe countenance of Milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under\nany other circumstances Mme. Bonacieux would have fled in terror; but\nshe was absorbed by jealousy.\n\n\"Speak, madame!\" resumed Mme. Bonacieux, with an energy of which she\nmight not have been believed capable. \"Have you been, or are you, his\nmistress?\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" cried Milady, with an accent that admitted no doubt of her\ntruth. \"Never, never!\"\n\n\"I believe you,\" said Mme. Bonacieux; \"but why, then, did you cry out\nso?\"\n\n\"Do you not understand?\" said Milady, who had already overcome her\nagitation and recovered all her presence of mind.\n\n\"How can I understand? I know nothing.\"\n\n\"Can you not understand that Monsieur d'Artagnan, being my friend, might\ntake me into his confidence?\"\n\n\"Truly?\"\n\n\"Do you not perceive that I know all--your abduction from the little\nhouse at St. Germain, his despair, that of his friends, and their\nuseless inquiries up to this moment? How could I help being astonished\nwhen, without having the least expectation of such a thing, I meet you\nface to face--you, of whom we have so often spoken together, you whom he\nloves with all his soul, you whom he had taught me to love before I\nhad seen you! Ah, dear Constance, I have found you, then; I see you at\nlast!\"\n\nAnd Milady stretched out her arms to Mme. Bonacieux, who, convinced by\nwhat she had just said, saw nothing in this woman whom an instant before\nshe had believed her rival but a sincere and devoted friend.\n\n\"Oh, pardon me, pardon me!\" cried she, sinking upon the shoulders of\nMilady. \"Pardon me, I love him so much!\"\n\nThese two women held each other for an instant in a close embrace.\nCertainly, if Milady's strength had been equal to her hatred, Mme.\nBonacieux would never have left that embrace alive. But not being able\nto stifle her, she smiled upon her.\n\n\"Oh, you beautiful, good little creature!\" said Milady. \"How delighted I\nam to have found you! Let me look at you!\" and while saying these words,\nshe absolutely devoured her by her looks. \"Oh, yes it is you indeed!\nFrom what he has told me, I know you now. I recognize you perfectly.\"\n\nThe poor young woman could not possibly suspect what frightful cruelty\nwas behind the rampart of that pure brow, behind those brilliant eyes in\nwhich she read nothing but interest and compassion.\n\n\"Then you know what I have suffered,\" said Mme. Bonacieux, \"since he has\ntold you what he has suffered; but to suffer for him is happiness.\"\n\nMilady replied mechanically, \"Yes, that is happiness.\" She was thinking\nof something else.\n\n\"And then,\" continued Mme. Bonacieux, \"my punishment is drawing to a\nclose. Tomorrow, this evening, perhaps, I shall see him again; and then\nthe past will no longer exist.\"\n\n\"This evening?\" asked Milady, roused from her reverie by these words.\n\"What do you mean? Do you expect news from him?\"\n\n\"I expect himself.\"\n\n\"Himself? D'Artagnan here?\"\n\n\"Himself!\"\n\n\"But that's impossible! He is at the siege of La Rochelle with the\ncardinal. He will not return till after the taking of the city.\"\n\n\"Ah, you fancy so! But is there anything impossible for my d'Artagnan,\nthe noble and loyal gentleman?\"\n\n\"Oh, I cannot believe you!\"\n\n\"Well, read, then!\" said the unhappy young woman, in the excess of her\npride and joy, presenting a letter to Milady.\n\n\"The writing of Madame de Chevreuse!\" said Milady to herself. \"Ah, I\nalways thought there was some secret understanding in that quarter!\" And\nshe greedily read the following few lines:\n\n\nMy Dear Child, Hold yourself ready. OUR FRIEND will see you soon, and\nhe will only see you to release you from that imprisonment in which\nyour safety required you should be concealed. Prepare, then, for your\ndeparture, and never despair of us.\n\nOur charming Gascon has just proved himself as brave and faithful as\never. Tell him that certain parties are grateful for the warning he has\ngiven.\n\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Milady; \"the letter is precise. Do you know what that\nwarning was?\"\n\n\"No, I only suspect he has warned the queen against some fresh\nmachinations of the cardinal.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's it, no doubt!\" said Milady, returning the letter to Mme.\nBonacieux, and letting her head sink pensively upon her bosom.\n\nAt that moment they heard the gallop of a horse.\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Mme. Bonacieux, darting to the window, \"can it be he?\"\n\nMilady remained still in bed, petrified by surprise; so many unexpected\nthings happened to her all at once that for the first time she was at a\nloss.\n\n\"He, he!\" murmured she; \"can it be he?\" And she remained in bed with her\neyes fixed.\n\n\"Alas, no!\" said Mme. Bonacieux; \"it is a man I don't know, although he\nseems to be coming here. Yes, he checks his pace; he stops at the gate;\nhe rings.\"\n\nMilady sprang out of bed.\n\n\"You are sure it is not he?\" said she.\n\n\"Yes, yes, very sure!\"\n\n\"Perhaps you did not see well.\"\n\n\"Oh, if I were to see the plume of his hat, the end of his cloak, I\nshould know HIM!\"\n\nMilady was dressing herself all the time.\n\n\"Yes, he has entered.\"\n\n\"It is for you or me!\"\n\n\"My God, how agitated you seem!\"\n\n\"Yes, I admit it. I have not your confidence; I fear the cardinal.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Mme. Bonacieux; \"somebody is coming.\"\n\nImmediately the door opened, and the superior entered.\n\n\"Did you come from Boulogne?\" demanded she of Milady.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied she, trying to recover her self-possession. \"Who wants\nme?\"\n\n\"A man who will not tell his name, but who comes from the cardinal.\"\n\n\"And who wishes to speak with me?\"\n\n\"Who wishes to speak to a lady recently come from Boulogne.\"\n\n\"Then let him come in, if you please.\"\n\n\"Oh, my God, my God!\" cried Mme. Bonacieux. \"Can it be bad news?\"\n\n\"I fear it.\"\n\n\"I will leave you with this stranger; but as soon as he is gone, if you\nwill permit me, I will return.\"\n\n\"PERMIT you? I BESEECH you.\"\n\nThe superior and Mme. Bonacieux retired.\n\nMilady remained alone, with her eyes fixed upon the door. An instant\nlater, the jingling of spurs was heard upon the stairs, steps drew near,\nthe door opened, and a man appeared.\n\nMilady uttered a cry of joy; this man was the Comte de Rochefort--the\ndemoniacal tool of his Eminence.\n\n\n\n\n62 TWO VARIETIES OF DEMONS\n\n\n\"Ah,\" cried Milady and Rochefort together, \"it is you!\"\n\n\"Yes, it is I.\"\n\n\"And you come?\" asked Milady.\n\n\"From La Rochelle; and you?\"\n\n\"From England.\"\n\n\"Buckingham?\"\n\n\"Dead or desperately wounded, as I left without having been able to hear\nanything of him. A fanatic has just assassinated him.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Rochefort, with a smile; \"this is a fortunate chance--one\nthat will delight his Eminence! Have you informed him of it?\"\n\n\"I wrote to him from Boulogne. But what brings you here?\"\n\n\"His Eminence was uneasy, and sent me to find you.\"\n\n\"I only arrived yesterday.\"\n\n\"And what have you been doing since yesterday?\"\n\n\"I have not lost my time.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't doubt that.\"\n\n\"Do you know whom I have encountered here?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Guess.\"\n\n\"How can I?\"\n\n\"That young woman whom the queen took out of prison.\"\n\n\"The mistress of that fellow d'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"Yes; Madame Bonacieux, with whose retreat the cardinal was\nunacquainted.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said Rochefort, \"here is a chance which may pair off with\nthe other! Monsieur Cardinal is indeed a privileged man!\"\n\n\"Imagine my astonishment,\" continued Milady, \"when I found myself face\nto face with this woman!\"\n\n\"Does she know you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then she looks upon you as a stranger?\"\n\nMilady smiled. \"I am her best friend.\"\n\n\"Upon my honor,\" said Rochefort, \"it takes you, my dear countess, to\nperform such miracles!\"\n\n\"And it is well I can, Chevalier,\" said Milady, \"for do you know what is\ngoing on here?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"They will come for her tomorrow or the day after, with an order from\nthe queen.\"\n\n\"Indeed! And who?\"\n\n\"d'Artagnan and his friends.\"\n\n\"Indeed, they will go so far that we shall be obliged to send them to\nthe Bastille.\"\n\n\"Why is it not done already?\"\n\n\"What would you? The cardinal has a weakness for these men which I\ncannot comprehend.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, then, tell him this, Rochefort. Tell him that our conversation\nat the inn of the Red Dovecot was overheard by these four men; tell him\nthat after his departure one of them came up to me and took from me by\nviolence the safe-conduct which he had given me; tell him they warned\nLord de Winter of my journey to England; that this time they nearly\nfoiled my mission as they foiled the affair of the studs; tell him that\namong these four men two only are to be feared--d'Artagnan and Athos;\ntell him that the third, Aramis, is the lover of Madame de Chevreuse--he\nmay be left alone, we know his secret, and it may be useful; as to the\nfourth, Porthos, he is a fool, a simpleton, a blustering booby, not\nworth troubling himself about.\"\n\n\"But these four men must be now at the siege of La Rochelle?\"\n\n\"I thought so, too; but a letter which Madame Bonacieux has received\nfrom Madame the Constable, and which she has had the imprudence to show\nme, leads me to believe that these four men, on the contrary, are on the\nroad hither to take her away.\"\n\n\"The devil! What's to be done?\"\n\n\"What did the cardinal say about me?\"\n\n\"I was to take your dispatches, written or verbal, and return by post;\nand when he shall know what you have done, he will advise what you have\nto do.\"\n\n\"I must, then, remain here?\"\n\n\"Here, or in the neighborhood.\"\n\n\"You cannot take me with you?\"\n\n\"No, the order is imperative. Near the camp you might be recognized; and\nyour presence, you must be aware, would compromise the cardinal.\"\n\n\"Then I must wait here, or in the neighborhood?\"\n\n\"Only tell me beforehand where you will wait for intelligence from the\ncardinal; let me know always where to find you.\"\n\n\"Observe, it is probable that I may not be able to remain here.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"You forget that my enemies may arrive at any minute.\"\n\n\"That's true; but is this little woman, then, to escape his Eminence?\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said Milady, with a smile that belonged only to herself; \"you\nforget that I am her best friend.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's true! I may then tell the cardinal, with respect to this\nlittle woman--\"\n\n\"That he may be at ease.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"He will know what that means.\"\n\n\"He will guess, at least. Now, then, what had I better do?\"\n\n\"Return instantly. It appears to me that the news you bear is worth the\ntrouble of a little diligence.\"\n\n\"My chaise broke down coming into Lilliers.\"\n\n\"Capital!\"\n\n\"What, CAPITAL?\"\n\n\"Yes, I want your chaise.\"\n\n\"And how shall I travel, then?\"\n\n\"On horseback.\"\n\n\"You talk very comfortably,--a hundred and eighty leagues!\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"One can do it! Afterward?\"\n\n\"Afterward? Why, in passing through Lilliers you will send me your\nchaise, with an order to your servant to place himself at my disposal.\"\n\n\"Well.\"\n\n\"You have, no doubt, some order from the cardinal about you?\"\n\n\"I have my FULL POWER.\"\n\n\"Show it to the abbess, and tell her that someone will come and fetch\nme, either today or tomorrow, and that I am to follow the person who\npresents himself in your name.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\"Don't forget to treat me harshly in speaking of me to the abbess.\"\n\n\"To what purpose?\"\n\n\"I am a victim of the cardinal. It is necessary to inspire confidence in\nthat poor little Madame Bonacieux.\"\n\n\"That's true. Now, will you make me a report of all that has happened?\"\n\n\"Why, I have related the events to you. You have a good memory; repeat\nwhat I have told you. A paper may be lost.\"\n\n\"You are right; only let me know where to find you that I may not run\nneedlessly about the neighborhood.\"\n\n\"That's correct; wait!\"\n\n\"Do you want a map?\"\n\n\"Oh, I know this country marvelously!\"\n\n\"You? When were you here?\"\n\n\"I was brought up here.\"\n\n\"Truly?\"\n\n\"It is worth something, you see, to have been brought up somewhere.\"\n\n\"You will wait for me, then?\"\n\n\"Let me reflect a little! Ay, that will do--at Armentieres.\"\n\n\"Where is that Armentieres?\"\n\n\"A little town on the Lys; I shall only have to cross the river, and I\nshall be in a foreign country.\"\n\n\"Capital! but it is understood you will only cross the river in case of\ndanger.\"\n\n\"That is well understood.\"\n\n\"And in that case, how shall I know where you are?\"\n\n\"You do not want your lackey?\"\n\n\"Is he a sure man?\"\n\n\"To the proof.\"\n\n\"Give him to me. Nobody knows him. I will leave him at the place I quit,\nand he will conduct you to me.\"\n\n\"And you say you will wait for me at Armentieres?\"\n\n\"At Armentieres.\"\n\n\"Write that name on a bit of paper, lest I should forget it. There is\nnothing compromising in the name of a town. Is it not so?\"\n\n\"Eh, who knows? Never mind,\" said Milady, writing the name on half a\nsheet of paper; \"I will compromise myself.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Rochefort, taking the paper from Milady, folding it, and\nplacing it in the lining of his hat, \"you may be easy. I will do as\nchildren do, for fear of losing the paper--repeat the name along the\nroute. Now, is that all?\"\n\n\"I believe so.\"\n\n\"Let us see: Buckingham dead or grievously wounded; your conversation\nwith the cardinal overheard by the four Musketeers; Lord de Winter\nwarned of your arrival at Portsmouth; d'Artagnan and Athos to the\nBastille; Aramis the lover of Madame de Chevreuse; Porthos an ass;\nMadame Bonacieux found again; to send you the chaise as soon as\npossible; to place my lackey at your disposal; to make you out a victim\nof the cardinal in order that the abbess may entertain no suspicion;\nArmentieres, on the banks of the Lys. Is that all, then?\"\n\n\"In truth, my dear Chevalier, you are a miracle of memory. A PROPOS, add\none thing--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I saw some very pretty woods which almost touch the convent garden. Say\nthat I am permitted to walk in those woods. Who knows? Perhaps I shall\nstand in need of a back door for retreat.\"\n\n\"You think of everything.\"\n\n\"And you forget one thing.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"To ask me if I want money.\"\n\n\"That's true. How much do you want?\"\n\n\"All you have in gold.\"\n\n\"I have five hundred pistoles, or thereabouts.\"\n\n\"I have as much. With a thousand pistoles one may face everything. Empty\nyour pockets.\"\n\n\"There.\"\n\n\"Right. And you go--\"\n\n\"In an hour--time to eat a morsel, during which I shall send for a post\nhorse.\"\n\n\"Capital! Adieu, Chevalier.\"\n\n\"Adieu, Countess.\"\n\n\"Commend me to the cardinal.\"\n\n\"Commend me to Satan.\"\n\nMilady and Rochefort exchanged a smile and separated. An hour afterward\nRochefort set out at a grand gallop; five hours after that he passed\nthrough Arras.\n\nOur readers already know how he was recognized by d'Artagnan, and how\nthat recognition by inspiring fear in the four Musketeers had given\nfresh activity to their journey.\n\n\n\n\n63 THE DROP OF WATER\n\nRochefort had scarcely departed when Mme. Bonacieux re-entered. She\nfound Milady with a smiling countenance.\n\n\"Well,\" said the young woman, \"what you dreaded has happened. This\nevening, or tomorrow, the cardinal will send someone to take you away.\"\n\n\"Who told you that, my dear?\" asked Milady.\n\n\"I heard it from the mouth of the messenger himself.\"\n\n\"Come and sit down close to me,\" said Milady.\n\n\"Here I am.\"\n\n\"Wait till I assure myself that nobody hears us.\"\n\n\"Why all these precautions?\"\n\n\"You shall know.\"\n\nMilady arose, went to the door, opened it, looked in the corridor, and\nthen returned and seated herself close to Mme. Bonacieux.\n\n\"Then,\" said she, \"he has well played his part.\"\n\n\"Who has?\"\n\n\"He who just now presented himself to the abbess as a messenger from the\ncardinal.\"\n\n\"It was, then, a part he was playing?\"\n\n\"Yes, my child.\"\n\n\"That man, then, was not--\"\n\n\"That man,\" said Milady, lowering her voice, \"is my brother.\"\n\n\"Your brother!\" cried Mme. Bonacieux.\n\n\"No one must know this secret, my dear, but yourself. If you reveal it\nto anyone in the world, I shall be lost, and perhaps yourself likewise.\"\n\n\"Oh, my God!\"\n\n\"Listen. This is what has happened: My brother, who was coming to my\nassistance to take me away by force if it were necessary, met with the\nemissary of the cardinal, who was coming in search of me. He followed\nhim. At a solitary and retired part of the road he drew his sword, and\nrequired the messenger to deliver up to him the papers of which he was\nthe bearer. The messenger resisted; my brother killed him.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Mme. Bonacieux, shuddering.\n\n\"Remember, that was the only means. Then my brother determined to\nsubstitute cunning for force. He took the papers, and presented himself\nhere as the emissary of the cardinal, and in an hour or two a carriage\nwill come to take me away by the orders of his Eminence.\"\n\n\"I understand. It is your brother who sends this carriage.\"\n\n\"Exactly; but that is not all. That letter you have received, and which\nyou believe to be from Madame de Chevreuse--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"It is a forgery.\"\n\n\"How can that be?\"\n\n\"Yes, a forgery; it is a snare to prevent your making any resistance\nwhen they come to fetch you.\"\n\n\"But it is d'Artagnan that will come.\"\n\n\"Do not deceive yourself. D'Artagnan and his friends are detained at the\nsiege of La Rochelle.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\"\n\n\"My brother met some emissaries of the cardinal in the uniform of\nMusketeers. You would have been summoned to the gate; you would have\nbelieved yourself about to meet friends; you would have been abducted,\nand conducted back to Paris.\"\n\n\"Oh, my God! My senses fail me amid such a chaos of iniquities. I\nfeel, if this continues,\" said Mme. Bonacieux, raising her hands to her\nforehead, \"I shall go mad!\"\n\n\"Stop--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I hear a horse's steps; it is my brother setting off again. I should\nlike to offer him a last salute. Come!\"\n\nMilady opened the window, and made a sign to Mme. Bonacieux to join her.\nThe young woman complied.\n\nRochefort passed at a gallop.\n\n\"Adieu, brother!\" cried Milady.\n\nThe chevalier raised his head, saw the two young women, and without\nstopping, waved his hand in a friendly way to Milady.\n\n\"The good George!\" said she, closing the window with an expression of\ncountenance full of affection and melancholy. And she resumed her seat,\nas if plunged in reflections entirely personal.\n\n\"Dear lady,\" said Mme. Bonacieux, \"pardon me for interrupting you; but\nwhat do you advise me to do? Good heaven! You have more experience than\nI have. Speak; I will listen.\"\n\n\"In the first place,\" said Milady, \"it is possible I may be deceived,\nand that d'Artagnan and his friends may really come to your assistance.\"\n\n\"Oh, that would be too much!\" cried Mme. Bonacieux, \"so much happiness\nis not in store for me!\"\n\n\"Then you comprehend it would be only a question of time, a sort of\nrace, which should arrive first. If your friends are the more speedy,\nyou are to be saved; if the satellites of the cardinal, you are lost.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes; lost beyond redemption! What, then, to do? What to do?\"\n\n\"There would be a very simple means, very natural--\"\n\n\"Tell me what!\"\n\n\"To wait, concealed in the neighborhood, and assure yourself who are the\nmen who come to ask for you.\"\n\n\"But where can I wait?\"\n\n\"Oh, there is no difficulty in that. I shall stop and conceal myself a\nfew leagues hence until my brother can rejoin me. Well, I take you with\nme; we conceal ourselves, and wait together.\"\n\n\"But I shall not be allowed to go; I am almost a prisoner.\"\n\n\"As they believe that I go in consequence of an order from the cardinal,\nno one will believe you anxious to follow me.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well! The carriage is at the door; you bid me adieu; you mount the step\nto embrace me a last time; my brother's servant, who comes to fetch me,\nis told how to proceed; he makes a sign to the postillion, and we set\noff at a gallop.\"\n\n\"But d'Artagnan! D'Artagnan! if he comes?\"\n\n\"Shall we not know it?\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Nothing easier. We will send my brother's servant back to Bethune,\nwhom, as I told you, we can trust. He shall assume a disguise, and\nplace himself in front of the convent. If the emissaries of the cardinal\narrive, he will take no notice; if it is Monsieur d'Artagnan and his\nfriends, he will bring them to us.\"\n\n\"He knows them, then?\"\n\n\"Doubtless. Has he not seen Monsieur d'Artagnan at my house?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes; you are right. Thus all may go well--all may be for the\nbest; but we do not go far from this place?\"\n\n\"Seven or eight leagues at the most. We will keep on the frontiers, for\ninstance; and at the first alarm we can leave France.\"\n\n\"And what can we do there?\"\n\n\"Wait.\"\n\n\"But if they come?\"\n\n\"My brother's carriage will be here first.\"\n\n\"If I should happen to be any distance from you when the carriage comes\nfor you--at dinner or supper, for instance?\"\n\n\"Do one thing.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"Tell your good superior that in order that we may be as much together\nas possible, you ask her permission to share my repast.\"\n\n\"Will she permit it?\"\n\n\"What inconvenience can it be?\"\n\n\"Oh, delightful! In this way we shall not be separated for an instant.\"\n\n\"Well, go down to her, then, to make your request. I feel my head a\nlittle confused; I will take a turn in the garden.\"\n\n\"Go and where shall I find you?\"\n\n\"Here, in an hour.\"\n\n\"Here, in an hour. Oh, you are so kind, and I am so grateful!\"\n\n\"How can I avoid interesting myself for one who is so beautiful and so\namiable? Are you not the beloved of one of my best friends?\"\n\n\"Dear d'Artagnan! Oh, how he will thank you!\"\n\n\"I hope so. Now, then, all is agreed; let us go down.\"\n\n\"You are going into the garden?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Go along this corridor, down a little staircase, and you are in it.\"\n\n\"Excellent; thank you!\"\n\nAnd the two women parted, exchanging charming smiles.\n\nMilady had told the truth--her head was confused, for her ill-arranged\nplans clashed one another like chaos. She required to be alone that she\nmight put her thoughts a little into order. She saw vaguely the future;\nbut she stood in need of a little silence and quiet to give all her\nideas, as yet confused, a distinct form and a regular plan.\n\nWhat was most pressing was to get Mme. Bonacieux away, and convey her to\na place of safety, and there, if matters required, make her a hostage.\nMilady began to have doubts of the issue of this terrible duel, in which\nher enemies showed as much perseverance as she did animosity.\n\nBesides, she felt as we feel when a storm is coming on--that this issue\nwas near, and could not fail to be terrible.\n\nThe principal thing for her, then, was, as we have said, to keep Mme.\nBonacieux in her power. Mme. Bonacieux was the very life of d'Artagnan.\nThis was more than his life, the life of the woman he loved; this\nwas, in case of ill fortune, a means of temporizing and obtaining good\nconditions.\n\nNow, this point was settled; Mme. Bonacieux, without any suspicion,\naccompanied her. Once concealed with her at Armentieres, it would be\neasy to make her believe that d'Artagnan had not come to Bethune. In\nfifteen days at most, Rochefort would be back; besides, during that\nfifteen days she would have time to think how she could best avenge\nherself on the four friends. She would not be weary, thank God! for she\nshould enjoy the sweetest pastime such events could accord a woman of\nher character--perfecting a beautiful vengeance.\n\nRevolving all this in her mind, she cast her eyes around her, and\narranged the topography of the garden in her head. Milady was like a\ngood general who contemplates at the same time victory and defeat, and\nwho is quite prepared, according to the chances of the battle, to march\nforward or to beat a retreat.\n\nAt the end of an hour she heard a soft voice calling her; it was Mme.\nBonacieux's. The good abbess had naturally consented to her request; and\nas a commencement, they were to sup together.\n\nOn reaching the courtyard, they heard the noise of a carriage which\nstopped at the gate.\n\nMilady listened.\n\n\"Do you hear anything?\" said she.\n\n\"Yes, the rolling of a carriage.\"\n\n\"It is the one my brother sends for us.\"\n\n\"Oh, my God!\"\n\n\"Come, come! courage!\"\n\nThe bell of the convent gate was sounded; Milady was not mistaken.\n\n\"Go to your chamber,\" said she to Mme. Bonacieux; \"you have perhaps some\njewels you would like to take.\"\n\n\"I have his letters,\" said she.\n\n\"Well, go and fetch them, and come to my apartment. We will snatch some\nsupper; we shall perhaps travel part of the night, and must keep our\nstrength up.\"\n\n\"Great God!\" said Mme. Bonacieux, placing her hand upon her bosom, \"my\nheart beats so I cannot walk.\"\n\n\"Courage, courage! remember that in a quarter of an hour you will be\nsafe; and think that what you are about to do is for HIS sake.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, everything for him. You have restored my courage by a single\nword; go, I will rejoin you.\"\n\nMilady ran up to her apartment quickly; she there found Rochefort's\nlackey, and gave him his instructions.\n\nHe was to wait at the gate; if by chance the Musketeers should appear,\nthe carriage was to set off as fast as possible, pass around the\nconvent, and go and wait for Milady at a little village which was\nsituated at the other side of the wood. In this case Milady would cross\nthe garden and gain the village on foot. As we have already said, Milady\nwas admirably acquainted with this part of France.\n\nIf the Musketeers did not appear, things were to go on as had been\nagreed; Mme. Bonacieux was to get into the carriage as if to bid her\nadieu, and she was to take away Mme. Bonacieux.\n\nMme. Bonacieux came in; and to remove all suspicion, if she had any,\nMilady repeated to the lackey, before her, the latter part of her\ninstructions.\n\nMilady asked some questions about the carriage. It was a chaise drawn by\nthree horses, driven by a postillion; Rochefort's lackey would precede\nit, as courier.\n\nMilady was wrong in fearing that Mme. Bonacieux would have any\nsuspicion. The poor young woman was too pure to suppose that any female\ncould be guilty of such perfidy; besides, the name of the Comtesse de\nWinter, which she had heard the abbess pronounce, was wholly unknown\nto her, and she was even ignorant that a woman had had so great and so\nfatal a share in the misfortune of her life.\n\n\"You see,\" said she, when the lackey had gone out, \"everything is ready.\nThe abbess suspects nothing, and believes that I am taken by order of\nthe cardinal. This man goes to give his last orders; take the least\nthing, drink a finger of wine, and let us be gone.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mme. Bonacieux, mechanically, \"yes, let us be gone.\"\n\nMilady made her a sign to sit down opposite, poured her a small glass of\nSpanish wine, and helped her to the wing of a chicken.\n\n\"See,\" said she, \"if everything does not second us! Here is night coming\non; by daybreak we shall have reached our retreat, and nobody can guess\nwhere we are. Come, courage! take something.\"\n\nMme. Bonacieux ate a few mouthfuls mechanically, and just touched the\nglass with her lips.\n\n\"Come, come!\" said Milady, lifting hers to her mouth, \"do as I do.\"\n\nBut at the moment the glass touched her lips, her hand remained\nsuspended; she heard something on the road which sounded like the\nrattling of a distant gallop. Then it grew nearer, and it seemed to her,\nalmost at the same time, that she heard the neighing of horses.\n\nThis noise acted upon her joy like the storm which awakens the sleeper\nin the midst of a happy dream; she grew pale and ran to the window,\nwhile Mme. Bonacieux, rising all in a tremble, supported herself upon\nher chair to avoid falling. Nothing was yet to be seen, only they heard\nthe galloping draw nearer.\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" said Mme. Bonacieux, \"what is that noise?\"\n\n\"That of either our friends or our enemies,\" said Milady, with her\nterrible coolness. \"Stay where you are, I will tell you.\"\n\nMme. Bonacieux remained standing, mute, motionless, and pale as a\nstatue.\n\nThe noise became louder; the horses could not be more than a hundred and\nfifty paces distant. If they were not yet to be seen, it was because the\nroad made an elbow. The noise became so distinct that the horses might\nbe counted by the rattle of their hoofs.\n\nMilady gazed with all the power of her attention; it was just light\nenough for her to see who was coming.\n\nAll at once, at the turning of the road she saw the glitter of laced\nhats and the waving of feathers; she counted two, then five, then eight\nhorsemen. One of them preceded the rest by double the length of his\nhorse.\n\nMilady uttered a stifled groan. In the first horseman she recognized\nd'Artagnan.\n\n\"Oh, my God, my God,\" cried Mme. Bonacieux, \"what is it?\"\n\n\"It is the uniform of the cardinal's Guards. Not an instant to be lost!\nFly, fly!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, let us fly!\" repeated Mme. Bonacieux, but without being able\nto make a step, glued as she was to the spot by terror.\n\nThey heard the horsemen pass under the windows.\n\n\"Come, then, come, then!\" cried Milady, trying to drag the young woman\nalong by the arm. \"Thanks to the garden, we yet can flee; I have the\nkey, but make haste! in five minutes it will be too late!\"\n\nMme. Bonacieux tried to walk, made two steps, and sank upon her knees.\nMilady tried to raise and carry her, but could not do it.\n\nAt this moment they heard the rolling of the carriage, which at the\napproach of the Musketeers set off at a gallop. Then three or four shots\nwere fired.\n\n\"For the last time, will you come?\" cried Milady.\n\n\"Oh, my God, my God! you see my strength fails me; you see plainly I\ncannot walk. Flee alone!\"\n\n\"Flee alone, and leave you here? No, no, never!\" cried Milady.\n\nAll at once she paused, a livid flash darted from her eyes; she ran to\nthe table, emptied into Mme. Bonacieux's glass the contents of a ring\nwhich she opened with singular quickness. It was a grain of a reddish\ncolor, which dissolved immediately.\n\nThen, taking the glass with a firm hand, she said, \"Drink. This wine\nwill give you strength, drink!\" And she put the glass to the lips of the\nyoung woman, who drank mechanically.\n\n\"This is not the way that I wished to avenge myself,\" said Milady,\nreplacing the glass upon the table, with an infernal smile, \"but, my\nfaith! we do what we can!\" And she rushed out of the room.\n\nMme. Bonacieux saw her go without being able to follow her; she was like\npeople who dream they are pursued, and who in vain try to walk.\n\nA few moments passed; a great noise was heard at the gate. Every instant\nMme. Bonacieux expected to see Milady, but she did not return. Several\ntimes, with terror, no doubt, the cold sweat burst from her burning\nbrow.\n\nAt length she heard the grating of the hinges of the opening gates;\nthe noise of boots and spurs resounded on the stairs. There was a great\nmurmur of voices which continued to draw near, amid which she seemed to\nhear her own name pronounced.\n\nAll at once she uttered a loud cry of joy, and darted toward the door;\nshe had recognized the voice of d'Artagnan.\n\n\"d'Artagnan! D'Artagnan!\" cried she, \"is it you? This way! this way!\"\n\n\"Constance? Constance?\" replied the young man, \"where are you? where are\nyou? My God!\"\n\nAt the same moment the door of the cell yielded to a shock, rather than\nopened; several men rushed into the chamber. Mme. Bonacieux had sunk\ninto an armchair, without the power of moving.\n\nD'Artagnan threw down a yet-smoking pistol which he held in his hand,\nand fell on his knees before his mistress. Athos replaced his in his\nbelt; Porthos and Aramis, who held their drawn swords in their hands,\nreturned them to their scabbards.\n\n\"Oh, d'Artagnan, my beloved d'Artagnan! You have come, then, at last!\nYou have not deceived me! It is indeed thee!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, Constance. Reunited!\"\n\n\"Oh, it was in vain she told me you would not come! I hoped in silence.\nI was not willing to fly. Oh, I have done well! How happy I am!\"\n\nAt this word SHE, Athos, who had seated himself quietly, started up.\n\n\"SHE! What she?\" asked d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Why, my companion. She who out of friendship for me wished to take me\nfrom my persecutors. She who, mistaking you for the cardinal's Guards,\nhas just fled away.\"\n\n\"Your companion!\" cried d'Artagnan, becoming more pale than the\nwhite veil of his mistress. \"Of what companion are you speaking, dear\nConstance?\"\n\n\"Of her whose carriage was at the gate; of a woman who calls herself\nyour friend; of a woman to whom you have told everything.\"\n\n\"Her name, her name!\" cried d'Artagnan. \"My God, can you not remember\nher name?\"\n\n\"Yes, it was pronounced in my hearing once. Stop--but--it is very\nstrange--oh, my God, my head swims! I cannot see!\"\n\n\"Help, help, my friends! her hands are icy cold,\" cried d'Artagnan. \"She\nis ill! Great God, she is losing her senses!\"\n\nWhile Porthos was calling for help with all the power of his strong\nvoice, Aramis ran to the table to get a glass of water; but he\nstopped at seeing the horrible alteration that had taken place in the\ncountenance of Athos, who, standing before the table, his hair rising\nfrom his head, his eyes fixed in stupor, was looking at one of the\nglasses, and appeared a prey to the most horrible doubt.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Athos, \"oh, no, it is impossible! God would not permit such a\ncrime!\"\n\n\"Water, water!\" cried d'Artagnan. \"Water!\"\n\n\"Oh, poor woman, poor woman!\" murmured Athos, in a broken voice.\n\nMme. Bonacieux opened her eyes under the kisses of d'Artagnan.\n\n\"She revives!\" cried the young man. \"Oh, my God, my God, I thank thee!\"\n\n\"Madame!\" said Athos, \"madame, in the name of heaven, whose empty glass\nis this?\"\n\n\"Mine, monsieur,\" said the young woman, in a dying voice.\n\n\"But who poured the wine for you that was in this glass?\"\n\n\"She.\"\n\n\"But who is SHE?\"\n\n\"Oh, I remember!\" said Mme. Bonacieux, \"the Comtesse de Winter.\"\n\nThe four friends uttered one and the same cry, but that of Athos\ndominated all the rest.\n\nAt that moment the countenance of Mme. Bonacieux became livid; a fearful\nagony pervaded her frame, and she sank panting into the arms of Porthos\nand Aramis.\n\nD'Artagnan seized the hands of Athos with an anguish difficult to be\ndescribed.\n\n\"And what do you believe?' His voice was stifled by sobs.\n\n\"I believe everything,\" said Athos biting his lips till the blood sprang\nto avoid sighing.\n\n\"d'Artagnan, d'Artagnan!\" cried Mme. Bonacieux, \"where art thou? Do not\nleave me! You see I am dying!\"\n\nD'Artagnan released the hands of Athos which he still held clasped in\nboth his own, and hastened to her. Her beautiful face was distorted\nwith agony; her glassy eyes had no longer their sight; a convulsive\nshuddering shook her whole body; the sweat rolled from her brow.\n\n\"In the name of heaven, run, call! Aramis! Porthos! Call for help!\"\n\n\"Useless!\" said Athos, \"useless! For the poison which SHE pours there is\nno antidote.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, yes! Help, help!\" murmured Mme. Bonacieux; \"help!\"\n\nThen, collecting all her strength, she took the head of the young man\nbetween her hands, looked at him for an instant as if her whole soul\npassed into that look, and with a sobbing cry pressed her lips to his.\n\n\"Constance, Constance!\" cried d'Artagnan.\n\nA sigh escaped from the mouth of Mme. Bonacieux, and dwelt for an\ninstant on the lips of d'Artagnan. That sigh was the soul, so chaste and\nso loving, which reascended to heaven.\n\nD'Artagnan pressed nothing but a corpse in his arms. The young man\nuttered a cry, and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as icy\nas herself.\n\nPorthos wept; Aramis pointed toward heaven; Athos made the sign of the\ncross.\n\nAt that moment a man appeared in the doorway, almost as pale as those\nin the chamber. He looked around him and saw Mme. Bonacieux dead, and\nd'Artagnan in a swoon. He appeared just at that moment of stupor which\nfollows great catastrophes.\n\n\"I was not deceived,\" said he; \"here is Monsieur d'Artagnan; and you are\nhis friends, Messieurs Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.\"\n\nThe persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the stranger with\nastonishment. It seemed to all three that they knew him.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" resumed the newcomer, \"you are, as I am, in search of a\nwoman who,\" added he, with a terrible smile, \"must have passed this way,\nfor I see a corpse.\"\n\nThe three friends remained mute--for although the voice as well as\nthe countenance reminded them of someone they had seen, they could not\nremember under what circumstances.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" continued the stranger, \"since you do not recognize a man\nwho probably owes his life to you twice, I must name myself. I am Lord\nde Winter, brother-in-law of THAT WOMAN.\"\n\nThe three friends uttered a cry of surprise.\n\nAthos rose, and offering him his hand, \"Be welcome, my Lord,\" said he,\n\"you are one of us.\"\n\n\"I set out five hours after her from Portsmouth,\" said Lord de Winter.\n\"I arrived three hours after her at Boulogne. I missed her by twenty\nminutes at St. Omer. Finally, at Lilliers I lost all trace of her. I\nwas going about at random, inquiring of everybody, when I saw you gallop\npast. I recognized Monsieur d'Artagnan. I called to you, but you did not\nanswer me; I wished to follow you, but my horse was too much fatigued to\ngo at the same pace with yours. And yet it appears, in spite of all your\ndiligence, you have arrived too late.\"\n\n\"You see!\" said Athos, pointing to Mme. Bonacieux dead, and to\nd'Artagnan, whom Porthos and Aramis were trying to recall to life.\n\n\"Are they both dead?\" asked Lord de Winter, sternly.\n\n\"No,\" replied Athos, \"fortunately Monsieur d'Artagnan has only fainted.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed, so much the better!\" said Lord de Winter.\n\nAt that moment d'Artagnan opened his eyes. He tore himself from the arms\nof Porthos and Aramis, and threw himself like a madman on the corpse of\nhis mistress.\n\nAthos rose, walked toward his friend with a slow and solemn step,\nembraced him tenderly, and as he burst into violent sobs, he said to him\nwith his noble and persuasive voice, \"Friend, be a man! Women weep for\nthe dead; men avenge them!\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" cried d'Artagnan, \"yes! If it be to avenge her, I am ready to\nfollow you.\"\n\nAthos profited by this moment of strength which the hope of vengeance\nrestored to his unfortunate friend to make a sign to Porthos and Aramis\nto go and fetch the superior.\n\nThe two friends met her in the corridor, greatly troubled and much upset\nby such strange events; she called some of the nuns, who against all\nmonastic custom found themselves in the presence of five men.\n\n\"Madame,\" said Athos, passing his arm under that of d'Artagnan, \"we\nabandon to your pious care the body of that unfortunate woman. She was\nan angel on earth before being an angel in heaven. Treat her as one of\nyour sisters. We will return someday to pray over her grave.\"\n\nD'Artagnan concealed his face in the bosom of Athos, and sobbed aloud.\n\n\"Weep,\" said Athos, \"weep, heart full of love, youth, and life! Alas,\nwould I could weep like you!\"\n\nAnd he drew away his friend, as affectionate as a father, as consoling\nas a priest, noble as a man who has suffered much.\n\nAll five, followed by their lackeys leading their horses, took their\nway to the town of Bethune, whose outskirts they perceived, and stopped\nbefore the first inn they came to.\n\n\"But,\" said d'Artagnan, \"shall we not pursue that woman?\"\n\n\"Later,\" said Athos. \"I have measures to take.\"\n\n\"She will escape us,\" replied the young man; \"she will escape us, and it\nwill be your fault, Athos.\"\n\n\"I will be accountable for her,\" said Athos.\n\nD'Artagnan had so much confidence in the word of his friend that he\nlowered his head, and entered the inn without reply.\n\nPorthos and Aramis regarded each other, not understanding this assurance\nof Athos.\n\nLord de Winter believed he spoke in this manner to soothe the grief of\nd'Artagnan.\n\n\"Now, gentlemen,\" said Athos, when he had ascertained there were five\nchambers free in the hotel, \"let everyone retire to his own apartment.\nd'Artagnan needs to be alone, to weep and to sleep. I take charge of\neverything; be easy.\"\n\n\"It appears, however,\" said Lord de Winter, \"if there are any measures\nto take against the countess, it concerns me; she is my sister-in-law.\"\n\n\"And me,\" said Athos, \"--she is my wife!\"\n\nD'Artagnan smiled--for he understood that Athos was sure of his\nvengeance when he revealed such a secret. Porthos and Aramis looked at\neach other, and grew pale. Lord de Winter thought Athos was mad.\n\n\"Now, retire to your chambers,\" said Athos, \"and leave me to act. You\nmust perceive that in my quality of a husband this concerns me. Only,\nd'Artagnan, if you have not lost it, give me the paper which fell from\nthat man's hat, upon which is written the name of the village of--\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said d'Artagnan, \"I comprehend! that name written in her hand.\"\n\n\"You see, then,\" said Athos, \"there is a god in heaven still!\"\n\n\n\n\n64 THE MAN IN THE RED CLOAK\n\nThe despair of Athos had given place to a concentrated grief which only\nrendered more lucid the brilliant mental faculties of that extraordinary\nman.\n\nPossessed by one single thought--that of the promise he had made, and of\nthe responsibility he had taken--he retired last to his chamber, begged\nthe host to procure him a map of the province, bent over it, examined\nevery line traced upon it, perceived that there were four different\nroads from Bethune to Armentieres, and summoned the lackeys.\n\nPlanchet, Grimaud, Bazin, and Mousqueton presented themselves, and\nreceived clear, positive, and serious orders from Athos.\n\nThey must set out the next morning at daybreak, and go to\nArmentieres--each by a different route. Planchet, the most intelligent\nof the four, was to follow that by which the carriage had gone upon\nwhich the four friends had fired, and which was accompanied, as may be\nremembered, by Rochefort's servant.\n\nAthos set the lackeys to work first because, since these men had been in\nthe service of himself and his friends he had discovered in each of\nthem different and essential qualities. Then, lackeys who ask questions\ninspire less mistrust than masters, and meet with more sympathy among\nthose to whom they address themselves. Besides, Milady knew the masters,\nand did not know the lackeys; on the contrary, the lackeys knew Milady\nperfectly.\n\nAll four were to meet the next day at eleven o'clock. If they had\ndiscovered Milady's retreat, three were to remain on guard; the fourth\nwas to return to Bethune in order to inform Athos and serve as a guide\nto the four friends. These arrangements made, the lackeys retired.\n\nAthos then arose from his chair, girded on his sword, enveloped himself\nin his cloak, and left the hotel. It was nearly ten o'clock. At ten\no'clock in the evening, it is well known, the streets in provincial\ntowns are very little frequented. Athos nevertheless was visibly anxious\nto find someone of whom he could ask a question. At length he met a\nbelated passenger, went up to him, and spoke a few words to him. The man\nhe addressed recoiled with terror, and only answered the few words\nof the Musketeer by pointing. Athos offered the man half a pistole to\naccompany him, but the man refused.\n\nAthos then plunged into the street the man had indicated with his\nfinger; but arriving at four crossroads, he stopped again, visibly\nembarrassed. Nevertheless, as the crossroads offered him a better chance\nthan any other place of meeting somebody, he stood still. In a few\nminutes a night watch passed. Athos repeated to him the same question\nhe had asked the first person he met. The night watch evinced the same\nterror, refused, in his turn, to accompany Athos, and only pointed with\nhis hand to the road he was to take.\n\nAthos walked in the direction indicated, and reached the suburb situated\nat the opposite extremity of the city from that by which he and his\nfriends had entered it. There he again appeared uneasy and embarrassed,\nand stopped for the third time.\n\nFortunately, a mendicant passed, who, coming up to Athos to ask charity,\nAthos offered him half a crown to accompany him where he was going. The\nmendicant hesitated at first, but at the sight of the piece of silver\nwhich shone in the darkness he consented, and walked on before Athos.\n\nArrived at the angle of a street, he pointed to a small house, isolated,\nsolitary, and dismal. Athos went toward the house, while the mendicant,\nwho had received his reward, left as fast as his legs could carry him.\n\nAthos went round the house before he could distinguish the door, amid\nthe red color in which the house was painted. No light appeared through\nthe chinks of the shutters; no noise gave reason to believe that it was\ninhabited. It was dark and silent as the tomb.\n\nThree times Athos knocked without receiving an answer. At the third\nknock, however, steps were heard inside. The door at length was opened,\nand a man appeared, of high stature, pale complexion, and black hair and\nbeard.\n\nAthos and he exchanged some words in a low voice, then the tall man\nmade a sign to the Musketeer that he might come in. Athos immediately\nprofited by the permission, and the door was closed behind him.\n\nThe man whom Athos had come so far to seek, and whom he had found\nwith so much trouble, introduced him into his laboratory, where he\nwas engaged in fastening together with iron wire the dry bones of a\nskeleton. All the frame was adjusted except the head, which lay on the\ntable.\n\nAll the rest of the furniture indicated that the dweller in this house\noccupied himself with the study of natural science. There were large\nbottles filled with serpents, ticketed according to their species; dried\nlizards shone like emeralds set in great squares of black wood, and\nbunches of wild odoriferous herbs, doubtless possessed of virtues\nunknown to common men, were fastened to the ceiling and hung down in the\ncorners of the apartment. There was no family, no servant; the tall man\nalone inhabited this house.\n\nAthos cast a cold and indifferent glance upon the objects we have\ndescribed, and at the invitation of him whom he came to seek sat down\nnear him.\n\nThen he explained to him the cause of his visit, and the service he\nrequired of him. But scarcely had he expressed his request when the\nunknown, who remained standing before the Musketeer, drew back with\nsigns of terror, and refused. Then Athos took from his pocket a small\npaper, on which two lines were written, accompanied by a signature and a\nseal, and presented them to him who had made too prematurely these signs\nof repugnance. The tall man had scarcely read these lines, seen the\nsignature, and recognized the seal, when he bowed to denote that he had\nno longer any objection to make, and that he was ready to obey.\n\nAthos required no more. He arose, bowed, went out, returned by the same\nway he came, re-entered the hotel, and went to his apartment.\n\nAt daybreak d'Artagnan entered the chamber, and demanded what was to be\ndone.\n\n\"To wait,\" replied Athos.\n\nSome minutes after, the superior of the convent sent to inform the\nMusketeers that the burial would take place at midday. As to the\npoisoner, they had heard no tidings of her whatever, only that she\nmust have made her escape through the garden, on the sand of which her\nfootsteps could be traced, and the door of which had been found shut. As\nto the key, it had disappeared.\n\nAt the hour appointed, Lord de Winter and the four friends repaired to\nthe convent; the bells tolled, the chapel was open, the grating of the\nchoir was closed. In the middle of the choir the body of the victim,\nclothed in her novitiate dress, was exposed. On each side of the choir\nand behind the gratings opening into the convent was assembled the whole\ncommunity of the Carmelites, who listened to the divine service, and\nmingled their chant with the chant of the priests, without seeing the\nprofane, or being seen by them.\n\nAt the door of the chapel d'Artagnan felt his courage fall anew, and\nreturned to look for Athos; but Athos had disappeared.\n\nFaithful to his mission of vengeance, Athos had requested to be\nconducted to the garden; and there upon the sand following the light\nsteps of this woman, who left sharp tracks wherever she went, he\nadvanced toward the gate which led into the wood, and causing it to be\nopened, he went out into the forest.\n\nThen all his suspicions were confirmed; the road by which the carriage\nhad disappeared encircled the forest. Athos followed the road for some\ntime, his eyes fixed upon the ground; slight stains of blood, which came\nfrom the wound inflicted upon the man who accompanied the carriage as\na courier, or from one of the horses, dotted the road. At the end of\nthree-quarters of a league, within fifty paces of Festubert, a larger\nbloodstain appeared; the ground was trampled by horses. Between the\nforest and this accursed spot, a little behind the trampled ground, was\nthe same track of small feet as in the garden; the carriage had stopped\nhere. At this spot Milady had come out of the wood, and entered the\ncarriage.\n\nSatisfied with this discovery which confirmed all his suspicions, Athos\nreturned to the hotel, and found Planchet impatiently waiting for him.\n\nEverything was as Athos had foreseen.\n\nPlanchet had followed the road; like Athos, he had discovered the stains\nof blood; like Athos, he had noted the spot where the horses had halted.\nBut he had gone farther than Athos--for at the village of Festubert,\nwhile drinking at an inn, he had learned without needing to ask a\nquestion that the evening before, at half-past eight, a wounded man who\naccompanied a lady traveling in a post-chaise had been obliged to\nstop, unable to go further. The accident was set down to the account of\nrobbers, who had stopped the chaise in the wood. The man remained in the\nvillage; the woman had had a relay of horses, and continued her journey.\n\nPlanchet went in search of the postillion who had driven her, and found\nhim. He had taken the lady as far as Fromelles; and from Fromelles she\nhad set out for Armentieres. Planchet took the crossroad, and by seven\no'clock in the morning he was at Armentieres.\n\nThere was but one tavern, the Post. Planchet went and presented himself\nas a lackey out of a place, who was in search of a situation. He had not\nchatted ten minutes with the people of the tavern before he learned that\na woman had come there alone about eleven o'clock the night before, had\nengaged a chamber, had sent for the master of the hotel, and told him\nshe desired to remain some time in the neighborhood.\n\nPlanchet had no need to learn more. He hastened to the rendezvous, found\nthe lackeys at their posts, placed them as sentinels at all the outlets\nof the hotel, and came to find Athos, who had just received this\ninformation when his friends returned.\n\nAll their countenances were melancholy and gloomy, even the mild\ncountenance of Aramis.\n\n\"What is to be done?\" asked d'Artagnan.\n\n\"To wait!\" replied Athos.\n\nEach retired to his own apartment.\n\nAt eight o'clock in the evening Athos ordered the horses to be saddled,\nand Lord de Winter and his friends notified that they must prepare for\nthe expedition.\n\nIn an instant all five were ready. Each examined his arms, and put\nthem in order. Athos came down last, and found d'Artagnan already on\nhorseback, and growing impatient.\n\n\"Patience!\" cried Athos; \"one of our party is still wanting.\"\n\nThe four horsemen looked round them with astonishment, for they sought\nvainly in their minds to know who this other person could be.\n\nAt this moment Planchet brought out Athos's house; the Musketeer leaped\nlightly into the saddle.\n\n\"Wait for me,\" cried he, \"I will soon be back,\" and he set off at a\ngallop.\n\nIn a quarter of an hour he returned, accompanied by a tall man, masked,\nand wrapped in a large red cloak.\n\nLord de Winter and the three Musketeers looked at one another\ninquiringly. Neither could give the others any information, for all were\nignorant who this man could be; nevertheless, they felt convinced that\nall was as it should be, as it was done by the order of Athos.\n\nAt nine o'clock, guided by Planchet, the little cavalcade set out,\ntaking the route the carriage had taken.\n\nIt was a melancholy sight--that of these six men, traveling in\nsilence, each plunged in his own thoughts, sad as despair, gloomy as\nchastisement.\n\n\n\n\n65 TRIAL\n\nIt was a stormy and dark night; vast clouds covered the heavens,\nconcealing the stars; the moon would not rise till midnight.\n\nOccasionally, by the light of a flash of lightning which gleamed along\nthe horizon, the road stretched itself before them, white and solitary;\nthe flash extinct, all remained in darkness.\n\nEvery minute Athos was forced to restrain d'Artagnan, constantly in\nadvance of the little troop, and to beg him to keep in the line, which\nin an instant he again departed from. He had but one thought--to go\nforward; and he went.\n\nThey passed in silence through the little village of Festubert, where\nthe wounded servant was, and then skirted the wood of Richebourg. At\nHerlier, Planchet, who led the column, turned to the left.\n\nSeveral times Lord de Winter, Porthos, or Aramis, tried to talk with the\nman in the red cloak; but to every interrogation which they put to him\nhe bowed, without response. The travelers then comprehended that there\nmust be some reason why the unknown preserved such a silence, and ceased\nto address themselves to him.\n\nThe storm increased, the flashes succeeded one another more rapidly,\nthe thunder began to growl, and the wind, the precursor of a hurricane,\nwhistled in the plumes and the hair of the horsemen.\n\nThe cavalcade trotted on more sharply.\n\nA little before they came to Fromelles the storm burst. They spread\ntheir cloaks. There remained three leagues to travel, and they did it\namid torrents of rain.\n\nD'Artagnan took off his hat, and could not be persuaded to make use\nof his cloak. He found pleasure in feeling the water trickle over his\nburning brow and over his body, agitated by feverish shudders.\n\nThe moment the little troop passed Goskal and were approaching the Port,\na man sheltered beneath a tree detached himself from the trunk with\nwhich he had been confounded in the darkness, and advanced into the\nmiddle of the road, putting his finger on his lips.\n\nAthos recognized Grimaud.\n\n\"What's the manner?\" cried Athos. \"Has she left Armentieres?\"\n\nGrimaud made a sign in the affirmative. D'Artagnan groaned his teeth.\n\n\"Silence, d'Artagnan!\" said Athos. \"I have charged myself with this\naffair. It is for me, then, to interrogate Grimaud.\"\n\n\"Where is she?\" asked Athos.\n\nGrimaud extended his hands in the direction of the Lys. \"Far from here?\"\nasked Athos.\n\nGrimaud showed his master his forefinger bent.\n\n\"Alone?\" asked Athos.\n\nGrimaud made the sign yes.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Athos, \"she is alone within half a league of us, in\nthe direction of the river.\"\n\n\"That's well,\" said d'Artagnan. \"Lead us, Grimaud.\"\n\nGrimaud took his course across the country, and acted as guide to the\ncavalcade.\n\nAt the end of five hundred paces, more or less, they came to a rivulet,\nwhich they forded.\n\nBy the aid of the lightning they perceived the village of Erquinheim.\n\n\"Is she there, Grimaud?\" asked Athos.\n\nGrimaud shook his head negatively.\n\n\"Silence, then!\" cried Athos.\n\nAnd the troop continued their route.\n\nAnother flash illuminated all around them. Grimaud extended his arm, and\nby the bluish splendor of the fiery serpent they distinguished a little\nisolated house on the banks of the river, within a hundred paces of a\nferry.\n\nOne window was lighted.\n\n\"Here we are!\" said Athos.\n\nAt this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and\ncame towards them. It was Mousqueton. He pointed his finger to the\nlighted window.\n\n\"She is there,\" said he.\n\n\"And Bazin?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"While I watched the window, he guarded the door.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Athos. \"You are good and faithful servants.\"\n\nAthos sprang from his horse, gave the bridle to Grimaud, and advanced\ntoward the window, after having made a sign to the rest of the troop to\ngo toward the door.\n\nThe little house was surrounded by a low, quickset hedge, two or three\nfeet high. Athos sprang over the hedge and went up to the window, which\nwas without shutters, but had the half-curtains closely drawn.\n\nHe mounted the skirting stone that his eyes might look over the curtain.\n\nBy the light of a lamp he saw a woman, wrapped in a dark mantle, seated\nupon a stool near a dying fire. Her elbows were placed upon a mean\ntable, and she leaned her head upon her two hands, which were white as\nivory.\n\nHe could not distinguish her countenance, but a sinister smile passed\nover the lips of Athos. He was not deceived; it was she whom he sought.\n\nAt this moment a horse neighed. Milady raised her head, saw close to the\npanes the pale face of Athos, and screamed.\n\nAthos, perceiving that she knew him, pushed the window with his knee and\nhand. The window yielded. The squares were broken to shivers; and Athos,\nlike the spectre of vengeance, leaped into the room.\n\nMilady rushed to the door and opened it. More pale and menacing than\nAthos, d'Artagnan stood on the threshold.\n\nMilady recoiled, uttering a cry. D'Artagnan, believing she might have\nmeans of flight and fearing she should escape, drew a pistol from his\nbelt; but Athos raised his hand.\n\n\"Put back that weapon, d'Artagnan!\" said he; \"this woman must be\ntried, not assassinated. Wait an instant, my friend, and you shall be\nsatisfied. Come in, gentlemen.\"\n\nD'Artagnan obeyed; for Athos had the solemn voice and the powerful\ngesture of a judge sent by the Lord himself. Behind d'Artagnan entered\nPorthos, Aramis, Lord de Winter, and the man in the red cloak.\n\nThe four lackeys guarded the door and the window.\n\nMilady had sunk into a chair, with her hands extended, as if to conjure\nthis terrible apparition. Perceiving her brother-in-law, she uttered a\nterrible cry.\n\n\"What do you want?\" screamed Milady.\n\n\"We want,\" said Athos, \"Charlotte Backson, who first was called Comtesse\nde la Fere, and afterwards Milady de Winter, Baroness of Sheffield.\"\n\n\"That is I! that is I!\" murmured Milady, in extreme terror; \"what do you\nwant?\"\n\n\"We wish to judge you according to your crime,\" said Athos; \"you shall\nbe free to defend yourself. Justify yourself if you can. M. d'Artagnan,\nit is for you to accuse her first.\"\n\nD'Artagnan advanced.\n\n\"Before God and before men,\" said he, \"I accuse this woman of having\npoisoned Constance Bonacieux, who died yesterday evening.\"\n\nHe turned towards Porthos and Aramis.\n\n\"We bear witness to this,\" said the two Musketeers, with one voice.\n\nD'Artagnan continued: \"Before God and before men, I accuse this woman of\nhaving attempted to poison me, in wine which she sent me from Villeroy,\nwith a forged letter, as if that wine came from my friends. God\npreserved me, but a man named Brisemont died in my place.\"\n\n\"We bear witness to this,\" said Porthos and Aramis, in the same manner\nas before.\n\n\"Before God and before men, I accuse this woman of having urged me to\nthe murder of the Baron de Wardes; but as no one else can attest\nthe truth of this accusation, I attest it myself. I have done.\" And\nd'Artagnan passed to the other side of the room with Porthos and Aramis.\n\n\"Your turn, my Lord,\" said Athos.\n\nThe baron came forward.\n\n\"Before God and before men,\" said he, \"I accuse this woman of having\ncaused the assassination of the Duke of Buckingham.\"\n\n\"The Duke of Buckingham assassinated!\" cried all present, with one\nvoice.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the baron, \"assassinated. On receiving the warning letter\nyou wrote to me, I had this woman arrested, and gave her in charge to\na loyal servant. She corrupted this man; she placed the poniard in his\nhand; she made him kill the duke. And at this moment, perhaps, Felton is\npaying with his head for the crime of this fury!\"\n\nA shudder crept through the judges at the revelation of these unknown\ncrimes.\n\n\"That is not all,\" resumed Lord de Winter. \"My brother, who made you his\nheir, died in three hours of a strange disorder which left livid traces\nall over the body. My sister, how did your husband die?\"\n\n\"Horror!\" cried Porthos and Aramis.\n\n\"Assassin of Buckingham, assassin of Felton, assassin of my brother, I\ndemand justice upon you, and I swear that if it be not granted to me, I\nwill execute it myself.\"\n\nAnd Lord de Winter ranged himself by the side of d'Artagnan, leaving the\nplace free for another accuser.\n\nMilady let her head sink between her two hands, and tried to recall her\nideas, whirling in a mortal vertigo.\n\n\"My turn,\" said Athos, himself trembling as the lion trembles at the\nsight of the serpent--\"my turn. I married that woman when she was a\nyoung girl; I married her in opposition to the wishes of all my family;\nI gave her my wealth, I gave her my name; and one day I discovered that\nthis woman was branded--this woman was marked with a FLEUR-DE-LIS on her\nleft shoulder.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Milady, raising herself, \"I defy you to find any tribunal\nwhich pronounced that infamous sentence against me. I defy you to find\nhim who executed it.\"\n\n\"Silence!\" said a hollow voice. \"It is for me to reply to that!\" And the\nman in the red cloak came forward in his turn.\n\n\"What man is that? What man is that?\" cried Milady, suffocated\nby terror, her hair loosening itself, and rising above her livid\ncountenance as if alive.\n\nAll eyes were turned towards this man--for to all except Athos he was\nunknown.\n\nEven Athos looked at him with as much stupefaction as the others, for he\nknew not how he could in any way find himself mixed up with the horrible\ndrama then unfolded.\n\nAfter approaching Milady with a slow and solemn step, so that the table\nalone separated them, the unknown took off his mask.\n\nMilady for some time examined with increasing terror that pale face,\nframed with black hair and whiskers, the only expression of which was\nicy impassibility. Then she suddenly cried, \"Oh, no, no!\" rising and\nretreating to the very wall. \"No, no! it is an infernal apparition! It\nis not he! Help, help!\" screamed she, turning towards the wall, as if\nshe would tear an opening with her hands.\n\n\"Who are you, then?\" cried all the witnesses of this scene.\n\n\"Ask that woman,\" said the man in the red cloak, \"for you may plainly\nsee she knows me!\"\n\n\"The executioner of Lille, the executioner of Lille!\" cried Milady, a\nprey to insensate terror, and clinging with her hands to the wall to\navoid falling.\n\nEvery one drew back, and the man in the red cloak remained standing\nalone in the middle of the room.\n\n\"Oh, grace, grace, pardon!\" cried the wretch, falling on her knees.\n\nThe unknown waited for silence, and then resumed, \"I told you well that\nshe would know me. Yes, I am the executioner of Lille, and this is my\nhistory.\"\n\nAll eyes were fixed upon this man, whose words were listened to with\nanxious attention.\n\n\"That woman was once a young girl, as beautiful as she is today. She was\na nun in the convent of the Benedictines of Templemar. A young priest,\nwith a simple and trustful heart, performed the duties of the church of\nthat convent. She undertook his seduction, and succeeded; she would have\nseduced a saint.\n\n\"Their vows were sacred and irrevocable. Their connection could not last\nlong without ruining both. She prevailed upon him to leave the country;\nbut to leave the country, to fly together, to reach another part\nof France, where they might live at ease because unknown, money was\nnecessary. Neither had any. The priest stole the sacred vases, and sold\nthem; but as they were preparing to escape together, they were both\narrested.\n\n\"Eight days later she had seduced the son of the jailer, and escaped.\nThe young priest was condemned to ten years of imprisonment, and to be\nbranded. I was executioner of the city of Lille, as this woman has\nsaid. I was obliged to brand the guilty one; and he, gentlemen, was my\nbrother!\n\n\"I then swore that this woman who had ruined him, who was more than his\naccomplice, since she had urged him to the crime, should at least share\nhis punishment. I suspected where she was concealed. I followed her, I\ncaught her, I bound her; and I imprinted the same disgraceful mark upon\nher that I had imprinted upon my poor brother.\n\n\"The day after my return to Lille, my brother in his turn succeeded in\nmaking his escape; I was accused of complicity, and was condemned to\nremain in his place till he should be again a prisoner. My poor brother\nwas ignorant of this sentence. He rejoined this woman; they fled\ntogether into Berry, and there he obtained a little curacy. This woman\npassed for his sister.\n\n\"The Lord of the estate on which the chapel of the curacy was situated\nsaw this pretend sister, and became enamoured of her--amorous to such\na degree that he proposed to marry her. Then she quitted him she had\nruined for him she was destined to ruin, and became the Comtesse de la\nFere--\"\n\nAll eyes were turned towards Athos, whose real name that was, and who\nmade a sign with his head that all was true which the executioner had\nsaid.\n\n\"Then,\" resumed he, \"mad, desperate, determined to get rid of an\nexistence from which she had stolen everything, honor and happiness,\nmy poor brother returned to Lille, and learning the sentence which had\ncondemned me in his place, surrendered himself, and hanged himself that\nsame night from the iron bar of the loophole of his prison.\n\n\"To do justice to them who had condemned me, they kept their word. As\nsoon as the identity of my brother was proved, I was set at liberty.\n\n\"That is the crime of which I accuse her; that is the cause for which\nshe was branded.\"\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said Athos, \"what is the penalty you demand\nagainst this woman?\"\n\n\"The punishment of death,\" replied d'Artagnan.\n\n\"My Lord de Winter,\" continued Athos, \"what is the penalty you demand\nagainst this woman?\"\n\n\"The punishment of death,\" replied Lord de Winter.\n\n\"Messieurs Porthos and Aramis,\" repeated Athos, \"you who are her judges,\nwhat is the sentence you pronounce upon this woman?\"\n\n\"The punishment of death,\" replied the Musketeers, in a hollow voice.\n\nMilady uttered a frightful shriek, and dragged herself along several\npaces upon her knees toward her judges.\n\nAthos stretched out his hand toward her.\n\n\"Charlotte Backson, Comtesse de la Fere, Milady de Winter,\" said he,\n\"your crimes have wearied men on earth and God in heaven. If you know a\nprayer, say it--for you are condemned, and you shall die.\"\n\nAt these words, which left no hope, Milady raised herself in all her\npride, and wished to speak; but her strength failed her. She felt that\na powerful and implacable hand seized her by the hair, and dragged her\naway as irrevocably as fatality drags humanity. She did not, therefore,\neven attempt the least resistance, and went out of the cottage.\n\nLord de Winter, d'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, went out close\nbehind her. The lackeys followed their masters, and the chamber was\nleft solitary, with its broken window, its open door, and its smoky lamp\nburning sadly on the table.\n\n\n\n\n66 EXECUTION\n\nIt was near midnight; the moon, lessened by its decline, and reddened\nby the last traces of the storm, arose behind the little town of\nArmentieres, which showed against its pale light the dark outline of its\nhouses, and the skeleton of its high belfry. In front of them the Lys\nrolled its waters like a river of molten tin; while on the other side\nwas a black mass of trees, profiled on a stormy sky, invaded by large\ncoppery clouds which created a sort of twilight amid the night. On the\nleft was an old abandoned mill, with its motionless wings, from the\nruins of which an owl threw out its shrill, periodical, and monotonous\ncry. On the right and on the left of the road, which the dismal\nprocession pursued, appeared a few low, stunted trees, which looked like\ndeformed dwarfs crouching down to watch men traveling at this sinister\nhour.\n\nFrom time to time a broad sheet of lightning opened the horizon in its\nwhole width, darted like a serpent over the black mass of trees, and\nlike a terrible scimitar divided the heavens and the waters into two\nparts. Not a breath of wind now disturbed the heavy atmosphere.\nA deathlike silence oppressed all nature. The soil was humid and\nglittering with the rain which had recently fallen, and the refreshed\nherbs sent forth their perfume with additional energy.\n\nTwo lackeys dragged Milady, whom each held by one arm. The executioner\nwalked behind them, and Lord de Winter, d'Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis\nwalked behind the executioner. Planchet and Bazin came last.\n\nThe two lackeys conducted Milady to the bank of the river. Her mouth\nwas mute; but her eyes spoke with their inexpressible eloquence,\nsupplicating by turns each of those on whom she looked.\n\nBeing a few paces in advance she whispered to the lackeys, \"A thousand\npistoles to each of you, if you will assist my escape; but if you\ndeliver me up to your masters, I have near at hand avengers who will\nmake you pay dearly for my death.\"\n\nGrimaud hesitated. Mousqueton trembled in all his members.\n\nAthos, who heard Milady's voice, came sharply up. Lord de Winter did the\nsame.\n\n\"Change these lackeys,\" said he; \"she has spoken to them. They are no\nlonger sure.\"\n\nPlanchet and Bazin were called, and took the places of Grimaud and\nMousqueton.\n\nOn the bank of the river the executioner approached Milady, and bound\nher hands and feet.\n\nThen she broke the silence to cry out, \"You are cowards, miserable\nassassins--ten men combined to murder one woman. Beware! If I am not\nsaved I shall be avenged.\"\n\n\"You are not a woman,\" said Athos, coldly and sternly. \"You do not\nbelong to the human species; you are a demon escaped from hell, whither\nwe send you back again.\"\n\n\"Ah, you virtuous men!\" said Milady; \"please to remember that he who\nshall touch a hair of my head is himself an assassin.\"\n\n\"The executioner may kill, without being on that account an assassin,\"\nsaid the man in the red cloak, rapping upon his immense sword. \"This\nis the last judge; that is all. NACHRICHTER, as say our neighbors, the\nGermans.\"\n\nAnd as he bound her while saying these words, Milady uttered two or\nthree savage cries, which produced a strange and melancholy effect in\nflying away into the night, and losing themselves in the depths of the\nwoods.\n\n\"If I am guilty, if I have committed the crimes you accuse me of,\"\nshrieked Milady, \"take me before a tribunal. You are not judges! You\ncannot condemn me!\"\n\n\"I offered you Tyburn,\" said Lord de Winter. \"Why did you not accept\nit?\"\n\n\"Because I am not willing to die!\" cried Milady, struggling. \"Because I\nam too young to die!\"\n\n\"The woman you poisoned at Bethune was still younger than you, madame,\nand yet she is dead,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"I will enter a cloister; I will become a nun,\" said Milady.\n\n\"You were in a cloister,\" said the executioner, \"and you left it to ruin\nmy brother.\"\n\nMilady uttered a cry of terror and sank upon her knees. The executioner\ntook her up in his arms and was carrying her toward the boat.\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" cried she, \"my God! are you going to drown me?\"\n\nThese cries had something so heartrending in them that M. d'Artagnan,\nwho had been at first the most eager in pursuit of Milady, sat down on\nthe stump of a tree and hung his head, covering his ears with the palms\nof his hands; and yet, notwithstanding, he could still hear her cry and\nthreaten.\n\nD'Artagnan was the youngest of all these men. His heart failed him.\n\n\"Oh, I cannot behold this frightful spectacle!\" said he. \"I cannot\nconsent that this woman should die thus!\"\n\nMilady heard these few words and caught at a shadow of hope.\n\n\"d'Artagnan, d'Artagnan!\" cried she; \"remember that I loved you!\"\n\nThe young man rose and took a step toward her.\n\nBut Athos rose likewise, drew his sword, and placed himself in the way.\n\n\"If you take one step farther, d'Artagnan,\" said he, \"we shall cross\nswords together.\"\n\nD'Artagnan sank on his knees and prayed.\n\n\"Come,\" continued Athos, \"executioner, do your duty.\"\n\n\"Willingly, monseigneur,\" said the executioner; \"for as I am a good\nCatholic, I firmly believe I am acting justly in performing my functions\non this woman.\"\n\n\"That's well.\"\n\nAthos made a step toward Milady.\n\n\"I pardon you,\" said he, \"the ill you have done me. I pardon you for my\nblasted future, my lost honor, my defiled love, and my salvation forever\ncompromised by the despair into which you have cast me. Die in peace!\"\n\nLord de Winter advanced in his turn.\n\n\"I pardon you,\" said he, \"for the poisoning of my brother, and the\nassassination of his Grace, Lord Buckingham. I pardon you for the death\nof poor Felton; I pardon you for the attempts upon my own person. Die in\npeace!\"\n\n\"And I,\" said M. d'Artagnan. \"Pardon me, madame, for having by a trick\nunworthy of a gentleman provoked your anger; and I, in exchange, pardon\nyou the murder of my poor love and your cruel vengeance against me. I\npardon you, and I weep for you. Die in peace!\"\n\n\"I am lost!\" murmured Milady in English. \"I must die!\"\n\nThen she arose of herself, and cast around her one of those piercing\nlooks which seemed to dart from an eye of flame.\n\nShe saw nothing; she listened, and she heard nothing.\n\n\"Where am I to die?\" said she.\n\n\"On the other bank,\" replied the executioner.\n\nThen he placed her in the boat, and as he was going to set foot in it\nhimself, Athos handed him a sum of silver.\n\n\"Here,\" said he, \"is the price of the execution, that it may be plain we\nact as judges.\"\n\n\"That is correct,\" said the executioner; \"and now in her turn, let this\nwoman see that I am not fulfilling my trade, but my debt.\"\n\nAnd he threw the money into the river.\n\nThe boat moved off toward the left-hand shore of the Lys, bearing\nthe guilty woman and the executioner; all the others remained on the\nright-hand bank, where they fell on their knees.\n\nThe boat glided along the ferry rope under the shadow of a pale cloud\nwhich hung over the water at that moment.\n\nThe troop of friends saw it gain the opposite bank; the figures were\ndefined like black shadows on the red-tinted horizon.\n\nMilady, during the passage had contrived to untie the cord which\nfastened her feet. On coming near the bank, she jumped lightly on shore\nand took to flight. But the soil was moist; on reaching the top of the\nbank, she slipped and fell upon her knees.\n\nShe was struck, no doubt, with a superstitious idea; she conceived that\nheaven denied its aid, and she remained in the attitude in which she had\nfallen, her head drooping and her hands clasped.\n\nThen they saw from the other bank the executioner raise both his arms\nslowly; a moonbeam fell upon the blade of the large sword. The two arms\nfell with a sudden force; they heard the hissing of the scimitar and the\ncry of the victim, then a truncated mass sank beneath the blow.\n\nThe executioner then took off his red cloak, spread it upon the ground,\nlaid the body in it, threw in the head, tied all up by the four corners,\nlifted it on his back, and entered the boat again.\n\nIn the middle of the stream he stopped the boat, and suspending his\nburden over the water cried in a loud voice, \"Let the justice of God be\ndone!\" and he let the corpse drop into the depths of the waters, which\nclosed over it.\n\nThree days afterward the four Musketeers were in Paris; they had not\nexceeded their leave of absence, and that same evening they went to pay\ntheir customary visit to M. de Treville.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" said the brave captain, \"I hope you have been well\namused during your excursion.\"\n\n\"Prodigiously,\" replied Athos in the name of himself and his comrades.\n\n\n\n\n67 CONCLUSION\n\nOn the sixth of the following month the king, in compliance with the\npromise he had made the cardinal to return to La Rochelle, left his\ncapital still in amazement at the news which began to spread itself of\nBuckingham's assassination.\n\nAlthough warned that the man she had loved so much was in great danger,\nthe queen, when his death was announced to her, would not believe the\nfact, and even imprudently exclaimed, \"it is false; he has just written\nto me!\"\n\nBut the next day she was obliged to believe this fatal intelligence;\nLaporte, detained in England, as everyone else had been, by the orders\nof Charles I, arrived, and was the bearer of the duke's dying gift to\nthe queen.\n\nThe joy of the king was lively. He did not even give himself the trouble\nto dissemble, and displayed it with affectation before the queen. Louis\nXIII, like every weak mind, was wanting in generosity.\n\nBut the king soon again became dull and indisposed; his brow was not one\nof those that long remain clear. He felt that in returning to camp he\nshould re-enter slavery; nevertheless, he did return.\n\nThe cardinal was for him the fascinating serpent, and himself the bird\nwhich flies from branch to branch without power to escape.\n\nThe return to La Rochelle, therefore, was profoundly dull. Our four\nfriends, in particular, astonished their comrades; they traveled\ntogether, side by side, with sad eyes and heads lowered. Athos alone\nfrom time to time raised his expansive brow; a flash kindled in his\neyes, and a bitter smile passed over his lips, then, like his comrades,\nhe sank again into reverie.\n\nAs soon as the escort arrived in a city, when they had conducted the\nking to his quarters the four friends either retired to their own or to\nsome secluded cabaret, where they neither drank nor played; they only\nconversed in a low voice, looking around attentively to see that no one\noverheard them.\n\nOne day, when the king had halted to fly the magpie, and the four\nfriends, according to their custom, instead of following the sport had\nstopped at a cabaret on the high road, a man coming from la Rochelle on\nhorseback pulled up at the door to drink a glass of wine, and darted a\nsearching glance into the room where the four Musketeers were sitting.\n\n\"Holloa, Monsieur d'Artagnan!\" said he, \"is not that you whom I see\nyonder?\"\n\nD'Artagnan raised his head and uttered a cry of joy. It was the man\nhe called his phantom; it was his stranger of Meung, of the Rue des\nFossoyeurs and of Arras.\n\nD'Artagnan drew his sword, and sprang toward the door.\n\nBut this time, instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his\nhorse, and advanced to meet d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Ah, monsieur!\" said the young man, \"I meet you, then, at last! This\ntime you shall not escape me!\"\n\n\"Neither is it my intention, monsieur, for this time I was seeking you;\nin the name of the king, I arrest you.\"\n\n\"How! what do you say?\" cried d'Artagnan.\n\n\"I say that you must surrender your sword to me, monsieur, and that\nwithout resistance. This concerns your head, I warn you.\"\n\n\"Who are you, then?\" demanded d'Artagnan, lowering the point of his\nsword, but without yet surrendering it.\n\n\"I am the Chevalier de Rochefort,\" answered the other, \"the equerry of\nMonsieur le Cardinal Richelieu, and I have orders to conduct you to his\nEminence.\"\n\n\"We are returning to his Eminence, monsieur the Chevalier,\" said\nAthos, advancing; \"and you will please to accept the word of Monsieur\nd'Artagnan that he will go straight to La Rochelle.\"\n\n\"I must place him in the hands of guards who will take him into camp.\"\n\n\"We will be his guards, monsieur, upon our word as gentlemen; but\nlikewise, upon our word as gentlemen,\" added Athos, knitting his brow,\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan shall not leave us.\"\n\nThe Chevalier de Rochefort cast a glance backward, and saw that Porthos\nand Aramis had placed themselves between him and the gate; he understood\nthat he was completely at the mercy of these four men.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"if Monsieur d'Artagnan will surrender his sword\nto me and join his word to yours, I shall be satisfied with your\npromise to convey Monsieur d'Artagnan to the quarters of Monseigneur the\nCardinal.\"\n\n\"You have my word, monsieur, and here is my sword.\"\n\n\"This suits me the better,\" said Rochefort, \"as I wish to continue my\njourney.\"\n\n\"If it is for the purpose of rejoining Milady,\" said Athos, coolly, \"it\nis useless; you will not find her.\"\n\n\"What has become of her, then?\" asked Rochefort, eagerly.\n\n\"Return to camp and you shall know.\"\n\nRochefort remained for a moment in thought; then, as they were only a\nday's journey from Surgeres, whither the cardinal was to come to meet\nthe king, he resolved to follow the advice of Athos and go with them.\nBesides, this return offered him the advantage of watching his prisoner.\n\nThey resumed their route.\n\nOn the morrow, at three o'clock in the afternoon, they arrived at\nSurgeres. The cardinal there awaited Louis XIII. The minister and the\nking exchanged numerous caresses, felicitating each other upon the\nfortunate chance which had freed France from the inveterate enemy who\nset all Europe against her. After which, the cardinal, who had been\ninformed that d'Artagnan was arrested and who was anxious to see him,\ntook leave of the king, inviting him to come the next day to view the\nwork already done upon the dyke.\n\nOn returning in the evening to his quarters at the bridge of La Pierre,\nthe cardinal found, standing before the house he occupied, d'Artagnan,\nwithout his sword, and the three Musketeers armed.\n\nThis time, as he was well attended, he looked at them sternly, and made\na sign with his eye and hand for d'Artagnan to follow him.\n\nD'Artagnan obeyed.\n\n\"We shall wait for you, d'Artagnan,\" said Athos, loud enough for the\ncardinal to hear him.\n\nHis Eminence bent his brow, stopped for an instant, and then kept on his\nway without uttering a single word.\n\nD'Artagnan entered after the cardinal, and behind d'Artagnan the door\nwas guarded.\n\nHis Eminence entered the chamber which served him as a study, and made a\nsign to Rochefort to bring in the young Musketeer.\n\nRochefort obeyed and retired.\n\nD'Artagnan remained alone in front of the cardinal; this was his second\ninterview with Richelieu, and he afterward confessed that he felt well\nassured it would be his last.\n\nRichelieu remained standing, leaning against the mantelpiece; a table\nwas between him and d'Artagnan.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the cardinal, \"you have been arrested by my orders.\"\n\n\"So they tell me, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"Do you know why?\"\n\n\"No, monseigneur, for the only thing for which I could be arrested is\nstill unknown to your Eminence.\"\n\nRichelieu looked steadfastly at the young man.\n\n\"Holloa!\" said he, \"what does that mean?\"\n\n\"If Monseigneur will have the goodness to tell me, in the first place,\nwhat crimes are imputed to me, I will then tell him the deeds I have\nreally done.\"\n\n\"Crimes are imputed to you which had brought down far loftier heads than\nyours, monsieur,\" said the cardinal.\n\n\"What, monseigneur?\" said d'Artagnan, with a calmness which astonished\nthe cardinal himself.\n\n\"You are charged with having corresponded with the enemies of the\nkingdom; you are charged with having surprised state secrets; you are\ncharged with having tried to thwart the plans of your general.\"\n\n\"And who charges me with this, monseigneur?\" said d'Artagnan, who had no\ndoubt the accusation came from Milady, \"a woman branded by the justice\nof the country; a woman who has espoused one man in France and another\nin England; a woman who poisoned her second husband and who attempted\nboth to poison and assassinate me!\"\n\n\"What do you say, monsieur?\" cried the cardinal, astonished; \"and of\nwhat woman are you speaking thus?\"\n\n\"Of Milady de Winter,\" replied d'Artagnan, \"yes, of Milady de Winter, of\nwhose crimes your Eminence is doubtless ignorant, since you have honored\nher with your confidence.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the cardinal, \"if Milady de Winter has committed the\ncrimes you lay to her charge, she shall be punished.\"\n\n\"She has been punished, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"And who has punished her?\"\n\n\"We.\"\n\n\"She is in prison?\"\n\n\"She is dead.\"\n\n\"Dead!\" repeated the cardinal, who could not believe what he heard,\n\"dead! Did you not say she was dead?\"\n\n\"Three times she attempted to kill me, and I pardoned her; but she\nmurdered the woman I loved. Then my friends and I took her, tried her,\nand condemned her.\"\n\nD'Artagnan then related the poisoning of Mme. Bonacieux in the convent\nof the Carmelites at Bethune, the trial in the isolated house, and the\nexecution on the banks of the Lys.\n\nA shudder crept through the body of the cardinal, who did not shudder\nreadily.\n\nBut all at once, as if undergoing the influence of an unspoken thought,\nthe countenance of the cardinal, till then gloomy, cleared up by\ndegrees, and recovered perfect serenity.\n\n\"So,\" said the cardinal, in a tone that contrasted strongly with the\nseverity of his words, \"you have constituted yourselves judges,\nwithout remembering that they who punish without license to punish are\nassassins?\"\n\n\"Monseigneur, I swear to you that I never for an instant had the\nintention of defending my head against you. I willingly submit to any\npunishment your Eminence may please to inflict upon me. I do not hold\nlife dear enough to be afraid of death.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know you are a man of a stout heart, monsieur,\" said the\ncardinal, with a voice almost affectionate; \"I can therefore tell you\nbeforehand you shall be tried, and even condemned.\"\n\n\"Another might reply to your Eminence that he had his pardon in his\npocket. I content myself with saying: Command, monseigneur; I am ready.\"\n\n\"Your pardon?\" said Richelieu, surprised.\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"And signed by whom--by the king?\" And the cardinal pronounced these\nwords with a singular expression of contempt.\n\n\"No, by your Eminence.\"\n\n\"By me? You are insane, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur will doubtless recognize his own handwriting.\"\n\nAnd d'Artagnan presented to the cardinal the precious piece of paper\nwhich Athos had forced from Milady, and which he had given to d'Artagnan\nto serve him as a safeguard.\n\nHis Eminence took the paper, and read in a slow voice, dwelling upon\nevery syllable:\n\n\n\"Dec. 3, 1627\n\n\"It is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this\nhas done what he has done.\n\n\"RICHELIEU\"\n\n\nThe cardinal, after having read these two lines, sank into a profound\nreverie; but he did not return the paper to d'Artagnan.\n\n\"He is meditating by what sort of punishment he shall cause me to\ndie,\" said the Gascon to himself. \"Well, my faith! he shall see how a\ngentleman can die.\"\n\nThe young Musketeer was in excellent disposition to die heroically.\n\nRichelieu still continued thinking, rolling and unrolling the paper in\nhis hands.\n\nAt length he raised his head, fixed his eagle look upon that loyal,\nopen, and intelligent countenance, read upon that face, furrowed with\ntears, all the sufferings its possessor had endured in the course of a\nmonth, and reflected for the third or fourth time how much there was\nin that youth of twenty-one years before him, and what resources his\nactivity, his courage, and his shrewdness might offer to a good master.\nOn the other side, the crimes, the power, and the infernal genius of\nMilady had more than once terrified him. He felt something like a secret\njoy at being forever relieved of this dangerous accomplice.\n\nRichelieu slowly tore the paper which d'Artagnan had generously\nrelinquished.\n\n\"I am lost!\" said d'Artagnan to himself. And he bowed profoundly before\nthe cardinal, like a man who says, \"Lord, Thy will be done!\"\n\nThe cardinal approached the table, and without sitting down, wrote a\nfew lines upon a parchment of which two-thirds were already filled, and\naffixed his seal.\n\n\"That is my condemnation,\" thought d'Artagnan; \"he will spare me the\nENNUI of the Bastille, or the tediousness of a trial. That's very kind\nof him.\"\n\n\"Here, monsieur,\" said the cardinal to the young man. \"I have taken from\nyou one CARTE BLANCHE to give you another. The name is wanting in this\ncommission; you can write it yourself.\"\n\nD'Artagnan took the paper hesitatingly and cast his eyes over it; it was\na lieutenant's commission in the Musketeers.\n\nD'Artagnan fell at the feet of the cardinal.\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" said he, \"my life is yours; henceforth dispose of it. But\nthis favor which you bestow upon me I do not merit. I have three friends\nwho are more meritorious and more worthy--\"\n\n\"You are a brave youth, d'Artagnan,\" interrupted the cardinal, tapping\nhim familiarly on the shoulder, charmed at having vanquished this\nrebellious nature. \"Do with this commission what you will; only\nremember, though the name be blank, it is to you I give it.\"\n\n\"I shall never forget it,\" replied d'Artagnan. \"Your Eminence may be\ncertain of that.\"\n\nThe cardinal turned and said in a loud voice, \"Rochefort!\" The\nchevalier, who no doubt was near the door, entered immediately.\n\n\"Rochefort,\" said the cardinal, \"you see Monsieur d'Artagnan. I receive\nhim among the number of my friends. Greet each other, then; and be wise\nif you wish to preserve your heads.\"\n\nRochefort and d'Artagnan coolly greeted each other with their lips; but\nthe cardinal was there, observing them with his vigilant eye.\n\nThey left the chamber at the same time.\n\n\"We shall meet again, shall we not, monsieur?\"\n\n\"When you please,\" said d'Artagnan.\n\n\"An opportunity will come,\" replied Rochefort.\n\n\"Hey?\" said the cardinal, opening the door.\n\nThe two men smiled at each other, shook hands, and saluted his Eminence.\n\n\"We were beginning to grow impatient,\" said Athos.\n\n\"Here I am, my friends,\" replied d'Artagnan; \"not only free, but in\nfavor.\"\n\n\"Tell us about it.\"\n\n\"This evening; but for the moment, let us separate.\"\n\nAccordingly, that same evening d'Artagnan repaired to the quarters of\nAthos, whom he found in a fair way to empty a bottle of Spanish wine--an\noccupation which he religiously accomplished every night.\n\nD'Artagnan related what had taken place between the cardinal and\nhimself, and drawing the commission from his pocket, said, \"Here, my\ndear Athos, this naturally belongs to you.\"\n\nAthos smiled with one of his sweet and expressive smiles.\n\n\"Friend,\" said he, \"for Athos this is too much; for the Comte de la\nFere it is too little. Keep the commission; it is yours. Alas! you have\npurchased it dearly enough.\"\n\nD'Artagnan left Athos's chamber and went to that of Porthos. He found\nhim clothed in a magnificent dress covered with splendid embroidery,\nadmiring himself before a glass.\n\n\"Ah, ah! is that you, dear friend?\" exclaimed Porthos. \"How do you think\nthese garments fit me?\"\n\n\"Wonderfully,\" said d'Artagnan; \"but I come to offer you a dress which\nwill become you still better.\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Porthos.\n\n\"That of a lieutenant of Musketeers.\"\n\nD'Artagnan related to Porthos the substance of his interview with the\ncardinal, and said, taking the commission from his pocket, \"Here, my\nfriend, write your name upon it and become my chief.\"\n\nPorthos cast his eyes over the commission and returned it to d'Artagnan,\nto the great astonishment of the young man.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"yes, that would flatter me very much; but I should\nnot have time enough to enjoy the distinction. During our expedition to\nBethune the husband of my duchess died; so, my dear, the coffer of the\ndefunct holding out its arms to me, I shall marry the widow. Look here!\nI was trying on my wedding suit. Keep the lieutenancy, my dear, keep\nit.\"\n\nThe young man then entered the apartment of Aramis. He found him\nkneeling before a PRIEDIEU with his head leaning on an open prayer book.\n\nHe described to him his interview with the cardinal, and said, for the\nthird time drawing his commission from his pocket, \"You, our friend, our\nintelligence, our invisible protector, accept this commission. You have\nmerited it more than any of us by your wisdom and your counsels, always\nfollowed by such happy results.\"\n\n\"Alas, dear friend!\" said Aramis, \"our late adventures have disgusted\nme with military life. This time my determination is irrevocably taken.\nAfter the siege I shall enter the house of the Lazarists. Keep the\ncommission, d'Artagnan; the profession of arms suits you. You will be a\nbrave and adventurous captain.\"\n\nD'Artagnan, his eye moist with gratitude though beaming with joy, went\nback to Athos, whom he found still at table contemplating the charms of\nhis last glass of Malaga by the light of his lamp.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"they likewise have refused me.\"\n\n\"That, dear friend, is because nobody is more worthy than yourself.\"\n\nHe took a quill, wrote the name of d'Artagnan in the commission, and\nreturned it to him.\n\n\"I shall then have no more friends,\" said the young man. \"Alas! nothing\nbut bitter recollections.\"\n\nAnd he let his head sink upon his hands, while two large tears rolled\ndown his cheeks.\n\n\"You are young,\" replied Athos; \"and your bitter recollections have time\nto change themselves into sweet remembrances.\"\n\n\n\n\nEPILOGUE\n\nLa Rochelle, deprived of the assistance of the English fleet and of the\ndiversion promised by Buckingham, surrendered after a siege of a year.\nOn the twenty-eighth of October, 1628, the capitulation was signed.\n\nThe king made his entrance into Paris on the twenty-third of December of\nthe same year. He was received in triumph, as if he came from conquering\nan enemy and not Frenchmen. He entered by the Faubourg St. Jacques,\nunder verdant arches.\n\nD'Artagnan took possession of his command. Porthos left the service, and\nin the course of the following year married Mme. Coquenard; the coffer\nso much coveted contained eight hundred thousand livres.\n\nMousqueton had a magnificent livery, and enjoyed the satisfaction of\nwhich he had been ambitious all his life--that of standing behind a\ngilded carriage.\n\nAramis, after a journey into Lorraine, disappeared all at once, and\nceased to write to his friends; they learned at a later period through\nMme. de Chevreuse, who told it to two or three of her intimates, that,\nyielding to his vocation, he had retired into a convent--only into\nwhich, nobody knew.\n\nBazin became a lay brother.\n\nAthos remained a Musketeer under the command of d'Artagnan till the year\n1633, at which period, after a journey he made to Touraine, he also quit\nthe service, under the pretext of having inherited a small property in\nRoussillon.\n\nGrimaud followed Athos.\n\nD'Artagnan fought three times with Rochefort, and wounded him three\ntimes.\n\n\"I shall probably kill you the fourth,\" said he to him, holding out his\nhand to assist him to rise.\n\n\"It is much better both for you and for me to stop where we are,\"\nanswered the wounded man. \"CORBLEU--I am more your friend than you\nthink--for after our very first encounter, I could by saying a word to\nthe cardinal have had your throat cut!\"\n\nThey this time embraced heartily, and without retaining any malice.\n\nPlanchet obtained from Rochefort the rank of sergeant in the Piedmont\nregiment.\n\nM. Bonacieux lived on very quietly, wholly ignorant of what had become\nof his wife, and caring very little about it. One day he had the\nimprudence to recall himself to the memory of the cardinal. The cardinal\nhad him informed that he would provide for him so that he should never\nwant for anything in future. In fact, M. Bonacieux, having left his\nhouse at seven o'clock in the evening to go to the Louvre, never\nappeared again in the Rue des Fossoyeurs; the opinion of those who\nseemed to be best informed was that he was fed and lodged in some royal\ncastle, at the expense of his generous Eminence.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Three Musketeers, by Alexandre Dumas, Pere\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE THREE MUSKETEERS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1257.txt or 1257.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/2/5/1257/\n\nProduced by John P.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
