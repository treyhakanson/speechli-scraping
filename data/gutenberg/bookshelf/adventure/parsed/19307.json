No lions live at Petra nowadays,\nat any rate, no four-legged ones; none could have survived\ncompetition with the biped. Unquestionably there were tamer,\ngentler, less assertive lions there once, real yellow cats with\nno worse inconveniences for the casual stranger than teeth,\nclaws, and appetites.\n\nThe Assyrian kings used to come and hunt near Petra, and brag\nabout it afterward; after you have well discounted the lies they\nmade their sculptors tell on huge stone monoliths when they got\nback home, they remain a pretty peppery line of potentates. But\nfor imagination, self-esteem, ambition, gall, and picturesque\ndepravity they were children--mere chickens--compared to the\nmodern gentleman whom Grim and I met up with A.D. 1920.\n\nYou can't begin at the beginning of a tale like this, because its\nroots reach too far back into ancient history. If, on the other\nhand, you elect to start at the end and work backward the\npredicament confronts you that there wasn't any end, nor\nany in sight.\n\nAs long as the Lion of Petra has a desert all about him and a\nchoice of caves, a camel within reach, and enough health to keep\nhim feeling normal--never mind whose camel it is, nor what power\nclaims to control the desert--there will be trouble for somebody\nand sport for him.\n\nSo, since it can have no end and no beginning, you might define\nthis as an episode--a mere interval between pipes, as it were, in\nthe amusing career of Ali Higg ben Jhebel ben Hashim, self-styled\nLion of Petra, Lord of the Wells, Chief of the Chiefs of the\nDesert, and Beloved of the Prophet of Al-Islam; not forgetting,\nthough, that his career was even supposed to amuse his victims or\ncompetitors. The fun is his, the fury other people's.\n\nThe beginning as concerns me was when I moved into quarters in\nGrim's mess in Jerusalem. As a civilian and a foreigner I could\nnot have done that, of course, if it had been a real mess; but\nGrim, who gets fun out of side-stepping all regulations, had\nestablished a sort of semi-military boarding-house for junior\nofficers who were tired of tents, and he was too high up in the\nIntelligence Department for anybody less than the administrator\nto interfere with him openly.\n\nHe did exactly as he pleased in that and a great many other\nmatters--did things that no British-born officer would have dared\ndo (because they are all crazy about precedent) but what they\nwere all very glad to have Grim do, because he was a bally\nAmerican, don't you know, and it was dashed convenient and all\nthat. And Grim was a mighty good fellow, even if he did like\nsyrup on his sausages.\n\nThe main point was that Grim was efficient. He delivered the\ngoods. He was perfectly willing to quit at any time if they did\nnot like his methods; and they did not want him to quit, because\nthere is nothing on earth more convenient for men in charge\nof public affairs than to have a good man on their string\nwho can be trusted to break all rules and use horse-sense on\nsuitable occasion.\n\nI had been in the mess about two days, I think, doing nothing\nexcept read Grim's books and learn Arabic, when I noticed signs\nof impending activity. Camel saddles began to be brought out from\nsomewhere behind the scenes, carefully examined, and put away\nagain. Far-sighted men with the desert smell on them, which is\nmore subtly stirring and romantic than all other smells, kept\ncoming in to squat on the rugs in the library and talk with Grim\nabout desert trails, and water, and what tribal feuds were in\nfull swing and which were in abeyance.\n\nThen, about the fourth or fifth day, the best two camel saddles\nwere thrown into a two-wheeled cart and sent off somewhere,\nalong with a tent, camp-beds, canned goods, and all the usual\nparaphernalia a white man seems to need when he steps out of his\ncage into the wild.\n\nI was reading when that happened, sitting in the arm-chair facing\nGrim, suppressing the impulse to ask questions, and trying to\nappear unaware that anything was going on. But it seemed to me\nthat there was too much provision made for one man, even for a\nmonth, and I had hopes. However, Grim is an aggravating cuss when\nso disposed, and he kept me waiting until the creaking of the\ndeparting cart-wheels and the blunt bad language of the man who\ndrove the mules could no longer be heard through the open window.\n\n\"Had enough excitement?\" he asked me then.\n\n\"There's not enough to be had,\" said I, pretending to continue reading.\n\n\"Care to cut loose out of bounds?\"\n\n\"Try me.\"\n\n\"The desert's no man's paradise this time o' year. Hotter than\nBilly-be- ----, and no cops looking after the traffic. They'll\nshoot a man for his shoe-leather.\"\n\n\"Any man can have my shoes when I can't use 'em.\"\n\n\"Heard of Petra?\"\n\nI nodded as casually as I could. Everybody who has been to\nPalestine has heard of that place, where an inaccessible city was\ncarved by the ancients out of solid rock, only to be utterly\nforgotten for centuries until Burkhardt rediscovered it.\n\n\"Heard too much. I don't believe a word of it.\"\n\n\"There's a problem there to be straightened out,\" said Grim.\n\"It's away and away beyond the British border; too far south for\nthe Damascus government to reach; too far north for the king of\nMecca; too far east for us; much too far west for the Mespot\noutfit. East of the sun and west of the moon you might say.\nThere's a sheikh there by the name of Ali Higg. I'm off to tackle\nhim. Care to come?\"\n\n\"When do we start?\"\n\n\"Now, from here. Tonight from Hebron. I'll give you time to make\nyour will, write to your lady-love, and crawl out if you care to.\nAli Higg is hot stuff. Suppose we leave it this way: I'll go on\nto Hebron. You think it over. You can overtake me at Hebron any\ntime before tonight, and if you do, all right; but if second\nthoughts make you squeamish about crucifixion--they tell me\nthat Ali Higg makes a specialty of that--I'll say you're wise\nto stay where you are. In any case I start from Hebron tonight.\nSuit yourself.\"\n\nAny man in his senses would get squeamish about crucifixion if he\nsat long enough and thought about it. I hate to feel squeamish\nalmost as much as I hate to sit and think, both being sure-fire\nways of getting into trouble. The only safe thing I know is to\nfollow opportunity and leave the man behind to do the worrying.\nMore people die lingering, ghastly deaths in arm-chairs and in\nbed than anywhere.\n\nSo I spoke of squeamishness and second thoughts with all the\nscorn that a man can use who hasn't yet tasted the enmity of the\ndesert and felt the fear of its loneliness; and Grim, who never\nwastes time arguing with folk who don't intend to be convinced,\nlaughed and got up.\n\n\"You can't come along as a white man.\"\n\n\"Produce the tar and feathers then,\" said I.\n\n\"Have you forgotten your Hindustani?\"\n\n\"Some of it.\"\n\n\"Think you can remember enough of it to deceive Arabs who never\nknew any at all?\"\n\n\"Narayan Singh was flattering me about it the other day.\"\n\n\"I know he was,\" said Grim. \"It was his suggestion we should take\nyou with us.\"\n\nThat illustrates perfectly Grim's way of letting out information\nin driblets. Evidently he had considered taking me on this trip\nas long as three days ago. It was equally news to me that the\nenormous Sikh, Narayan Singh, had any use for me; I had always\nsupposed that he had accepted me on sufferance for Grim's sake,\nand that in his heart he scorned me as a tenderfoot. You can no\nmore dig beneath the subtlety of Sikh politeness than you can\noverbear his truculence, and it is only by results that you may\nknow your friend and recognize your enemy.\n\nNarayan Singh came in, and he did not permit any such weakness as\na smile to escape him. When great things are being staged it is\nhis peculiar delight to look wooden. Not even his alert brown\neyes betrayed excitement. Like most Sikhs, he can stand looking\nstraight in front of him and take in every detail of his\nsurroundings; with his khaki sepoy uniform perfect down to the\nlast crease, and his great black bristly beard groomed until it\nshone, he might have been ready for a dress parade.\n\n\"Is everything ready?\" asked Grim.\n\n\"No, sahib. Suliman weeps.\"\n\n\"Spank him! What's the matter this time?\"\n\n\"He has a friend. He demands to take the friend.\"\n\n\"What?\" I said. \"Is that little ---- coming?\"\n\nTwo men in all Jerusalem, and only two that I knew of, had any\nkind of use for Suliman, the eight-year-old left-over from the\nwar whom Grim had adopted in a fashion, and used in a way that\nscandalized the missionaries. He and Narayan Singh took delight\nin the brat's iniquities, seeing precocious intelligence where\nother folk denounced hereditary vice. I had a scar on my thumb\nwhere the little beast had bitten me on one occasion when I did\nnot dare yell or retaliate, and, along with the majority, I\ncondemned him cordially.\n\n\"Who's his friend?\" asked Grim.\n\n\"Abdullah.\"\n\nNow Abdullah was worse than Suliman. He had no friends at all,\nanywhere, that anybody knew of. Possibly nine years old, he had\npicked up all the evil that a boy can learn behind the lines of a\nbeaten Turkish army officered by Germans--which is almost the\nabsolute of evil--and had added that to natural depravity.\n\n\"Let Abdullah come,\" said Grim. \"But beat Suliman first of all\nfor weeping. Don't hit him with your hand, Narayan Singh, for\nthat might hurt his feelings. Use a stick, and give him a grown\nman's beating.\"\n\n_\"Atcha, sahib.\"_\n\nTwo minutes later yells like a hungry bobcat's gave notice to\nwhom it might concern that the Sikh was carrying out the letter\nof his orders. It was good music. Nevertheless, quite a little of\nthe prospect was spoiled for me by the thought of keeping company\nwith those two Jerusalem guttersnipes. I would have remonstrated,\nonly for conviction, born of experience, that passengers\nshouldn't try to run the ship.\n\n\"What shall I pack?\" I asked.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Grim answered. \"Stick a toothbrush in your pocket.\nI've got soap, but you'll have small chance to use it.\"\n\n\"You said I can't go as a white man.\"\n\n\"True. We'll fix you up at Hebron. The Arabs have scads of\nproverbs,\" he answered, lighting a cigarette with a gesture\npeculiar to him at times when he is using words to hide his\nthoughts. \"One of the best is: `Conceal thy tenets, thy treasure,\nand thy traveling.'\n\n\"The Hebron road is not the road to Petra. We're going to\njoy-ride in the wrong direction, and leave Jerusalem guessing.\"\n\nFive minutes later Grim and I were on the back seat of a Ford\ncar, bowling along the Hebron road under the glorious gray walls\nof Jerusalem; Narayan Singh and the two brats were enjoying our\ndust in another car behind us. There being no luggage there was\nnothing to excite passing curiosity, and we were not even envied\nby the officers condemned to dull routine work in the city.\n\nGrim was all smiles now, as he always is when he can leave the\nalleged delights of civilization and meet life where he likes\nit--out of bounds. He was still wearing his major's uniform,\nwhich made him look matter-of-fact and almost commonplace--one of\na pattern, as they stamp all armies. But have you seen a strong\nswimmer on his way to the beach--a man who feels himself already\nin the sea, so that his clothes are no more than a loose shell\nthat he will cast off presently? Don't you know how you see the\nman stripped already, as he feels himself?\n\nSo it was with Grim that morning. Each time I looked away from\nhim and glanced back it was a surprise to see the khaki uniform.\n\nThe country, that about a week ago had been carpeted with flowers\nfrom end to end, was all bone-dry already, and the naked hills\nstood sharp and shimmering in heat-haze; one minute you could\nsee the edges of ribbed rock like glittering gray monsters'\nskeletons, and the next they were gone in the dazzle, or hidden\nbehind a whirling cloud of dust. Up there, three thousand feet\nabove sea-level, there was still some sweetness in the air, but\nwhenever we looked down through a gap in the range toward the\nDead Sea Valley we could watch the oven-heat ascending like fumes\nabove a bed of white-hot charcoal.\n\n\"Some season for a picnic!\" Grim commented, as cheerfully as if\nwe were riding to a wedding. \"You've time to crawl out yet. We\ncross that valley on the first leg, and that's merely a sample!\"\n\nBut it's easy enough to be driven forward in comfort to a new\nexperience, never mind what past years have taught, nor what\nimagination can depict; if that were not so no new battles would\nbe fought, and women would refuse to restock the world with\ntrouble's makings. A reasoning animal man may be, but he isn't\noften guided by his reason, and at that early stage in the\nproceedings you couldn't have argued me out of them with anything\nmuch less persuasive than brute force.\n\nWe rolled down the white road into Hebron in a cloud of dust\nbefore midday, and de Crespigny, the governor of the district,\ncame out to greet us like old friends; for it was only a matter\nof weeks since he and we and some others had stood up to death\ntogether, and that tie has a way of binding closer than\nconventional associations do.\n\nBut there were other friends who were equally glad to see us.\nSeventeen men came out from the shadow of the governorate wall,\nand stood in line to shake hands--and that is a lengthy business,\nfor it is bad manners to be the first to let go of an Arab's\nhand, so that tact is required as well as patience; but it was\nwell worth while standing in the sun repeating the back-and-forth\nrigmarole of Arab greeting if that meant that Ali Baba and his\nsixteen sons and grandsons were to be our companions on the\nadventure. They followed us at last into the governorate, and sat\ndown on the hall carpet with the air of men who know what fun the\nfuture holds.\n\nNarayan Singh stayed out in the hall and looked them over. There\nis something in the make-up of the Sikh that, while it gives\nhim to understand the strength and weaknesses of almost any\nalien race, yet constrains him more or less to the policeman's\nviewpoint. It isn't a moral viewpoint exactly; he doesn't\ninvariably disapprove; but he isn't deceived as to the possibilities,\nand yields no jot or tittle of the upper hand if he can only once\nassume it. There was scant love lost between him and old Ali Baba.\n\n_\"Nharak said,_* O ye thieves!\" he remarked, looking down into\nAli Baba's mild old eyes. [* Greeting!]\n\nSquatting in loose-flowing robes, princely bred, and almost\nsaintly with his beautiful gray beard, the patriarch looked frail\nenough to be squashed under the Sikh's enormous thumb. But he\nwasn't much impressed.\n\n\"God give thee good sense, Sikh!\" was the prompt answer.\n\n\"Fear Allah, and eschew infidelity while there is yet time!\"\nboomed a man as big as the Sikh and a third as heavy again--Ali\nBaba's eldest son, a sunny-tempered rogue, as I knew from\npast experience.\n\n\"Whose husband have you put to shame by fathering those two\nbrats?\" asked a third man.\n\nMahommed that was, Ali Baba's youngest, who had saved Grim's life\nand mine at El-Kerak.\n\nThey all laughed uproariously at that jest, so Mahommed repeated\nit more pointedly, and the Sikh turned his back to consider the\nsunshine through the open door and the rising heat within.\nSuliman and the other little gutter-snipe proceeded to make\nfriends with the whole gang promptly, giving as good as they got\nin the way of repartee, and nearly starting a riot until Grim\ncalled Ali Baba into the dining-room, where de Crespigny was\nshaking up the second round of warm cocktails in a beer-bottle.\n\nAli Baba chose to presume that the mixture was intended for\nhimself. The instant de Crespigny set the bottle on the table the\nold rascal tipped the lot into a tumbler and drank it off.\n\n\"It is good that the Koran says nothing against such stuff as\nthis,\" he said, blinking as he set the glass down. \"I have never\ntasted wine,\" he added righteously.\n\n\"Are the camels ready?\" asked Grim.\n\n\"Surely.\"\n\n\"What sort are they? Mangy old louse-food, I suppose, that had\nbeen turned out by the Jews to die?\"\n\n\"Allah! My sons have scoured Hebron for the best. Never were such\ncamels! They are fit to make the pilgrimage to Mecca.\"\n\n\"I suppose that means that the rent to be charged for each old\ncamel for a month is more than the purchase-price of a really\ngood one?\"\n\n\"The camels are mine, Jimgrim. I have bought them. Shall there be\ntalk of renting between me and thee?\"\n\n\"Not yet. After I've seen the beasts. If they're as good as you\nsay I'll pay you at the government rate for them per month.\"\n\n\"Allah forbid! The camels are yours, Jimgrim. For me and mine\nthere will no doubt be a profit from this venture without\nstriking bargains between friends.\"\n\nGrim smiled at that like a merchant listening to a salesman. It\nis not often that you can tell the color of his eyes, but on\noccasions of that sort they look iron-gray and match the bushy\neyebrows. He turned to de Crespigny.\n\n\"Have you finished the census, 'Crep?\"\n\n\"Pretty nearly.\"\n\n\"Have you got Ali Baba's property all listed?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And that of his sons and grandsons?\"\n\n\"Every bit of it that's taxable.\"\n\n\"Good. You hear that, Ali Baba? Now listen to me, you old rascal.\nWhen you complained to me the other day that there was no more\nthieving left to do in Hebron, I told you you're rich enough to\nquit, and you admitted it, you remember? You agreed with\nme that jail isn't a dignified place for a man of your years\nand experience.\"\n\n_\"Taib._* Jail is not good.\" [* All right]\n\n\"But you complained that you couldn't keep your gang out\nof mischief.\"\n\n\"Truly. They are young. They have talent. Shall they sit still\nand grow fat like a pasha in the harem?\"\n\n\"So I said I'd find them some honest employment from time\nto time.\"\n\n\"That was a good promise. Here already is employment. But you\nknow, Jimgrim, they are used to rich profits in return for\nrunning risks. Danger is meat and drink to them.\"\n\n\"They shall have their fill this trip!\" said Grim.\n\n_\"Taib._ But the reward should be proportionate.\"\n\n\"Government wages!\" Grim answered firmly. The old Arab smiled.\n\n\"Under the Turks,\" he answered, \"the officer pocketed the pay,\nand the men might help themselves.\"\n\n\"D'you take me for a Turk?\" asked Grim.\n\n\"No, Jimgrim. I know you for a cunning contriver--an upsetter\nof calculations--but no Turk. Nevertheless, as I understand\nit, we go against Ali Higg, who calls himself the Lion of Petra.\nSheikh Ali Higg has amassed a heap of plunder--hundreds of\ncamels--merchandise taken from the caravans; that should be ours\nfor the lifting. That is honest. That is reasonable.\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it!\" said Grim. \"Let's get that clear before we\nstart. I know your game. You've got it all fixed up between\nyourselves to stick with me until Ali Higg is _mafish_* and\nthen bolt for the skyline with the plunder. Not a bit of\nuse arguing--I know. You shouldn't talk your plans over in\ncoffee-shop corners if you don't want me to hear of them.\"\n\n---------\n* Lit., nothing--corresponds to \"na-poo\" in Army slang.\n---------\n\n\"Jimgrim, you are the devil!\"\n\n\"Maybe. But let's understand each other. Your property in Hebron\nis all listed. We'll call that a pledge for good behavior. You\nand your men are going to have government rifles served out to\nyou that you'll have to account for afterward. Every rifle\nmissing when we get back, and every scrap of loot you lay your\nhands on, will be charged double against your Hebron property. On\nthe other hand, if any camels die you shall be reimbursed. Is\nthat clear?\"\n\n\"Clear? A camel in the dark could understand it! But listen, Jimgrim.\"\n\nThe venerable sire of rogues went and sat crosslegged on the\nwindow-seat, evidently meaning to debate the point. If an Arab\nloves one thing more than a standing argument it is that same\nthing sitting down.\n\n\"We go against Ali Higg. That is no light matter. He will send\nhis men against us, and that is no light matter either. They are\nheretics without hope of paradise and bent on seeing hell before\ntheir time! Surely they will come to loot our camp in the dark.\nShall we not defend ourselves?\"\n\nBut Grim was not disposed to stumble into any traps.\n\n\"Does a loaded camel on the level trouble about hills?\" he asked.\n\nBut Ali Baba waved the question aside as irrelevant.\n\n\"They come. We defend ourselves. One, or maybe two, or even more\nof Ali Higg's scoundrels are slain. Behold a blood-feud! Jimgrim\nand his friends depart for El-Kudz* or elsewhere; Ali Baba and\nhis sons have a feud on their hands. [* Jerusalem]\n\n\"Now a feud, Jimgrim, has its price! It would do my old heart\ngood to see the blood of Ali Higg and his heretics, for it is\nwritten that we should smite the heretic and spare not. But we\nshould also despoil him of his goods, or the Prophet will not be\npleased with us!\"\n\n\"That is the talk of a rooster on a dung-hill,\" Grim answered. \"A\nrooster crows a mile away. Another answers with a challenge, but\nthe camels draw the plow in ten fields between them. That is like\na blood-feud between you and Ali Higg. Five days' march from here\nto Petra and how many deserts and tribes between?\"\n\n\"So much the easier to keep the loot when we have won it!\"\nanswered Ali Baba.\n\n\"There's going to be no loot!\" said Grim.\n\n\"Allah!\"\n\n\"Would you rather have me send back to Jerusalem for regular police?\"\n\n\"Nay, Jimgrim! That would be the end of you, for those police\nwould bungle everything. You need clever fellows with you if you\ngo to sup with Ali Higg.\"\n\n\"Well? Are you coming?\"\n\n_\"Taib._ We are ready. But--\"\n\n\"On my terms!\"\n\n\"But the pay is nothing!\"\n\n\"So is my pay nothing! This man\"--he pointed to me--\"gets no pay\nat all. Narayan Singh, the Sikh, gets less pay than a policeman.\"\n\n\"Then what is the profit?\"\n\n\"For you? The honor of keeping your word. The privilege of making\nfair return for past immunity. Why aren't you and all your sons\nin jail this minute? Why did I invite you to come with me on this\noccasion? Because a man looks for friends where he has given\nfavors! But if you consider you owe the administration nothing\nfor forgiving all past offenses, very well; I'll look for\nfriends elsewhere.\"\n\n\"As for the administration, Jimgrim, may Allah turn its face\ncold! But you are another matter. We will come with you.\"\n\n\"On my terms?\"\n\n_\"Taib.\"_\n\nYou would have thought that settled it, especially as Ali Baba\nhad already stated that he and his gang were prepared for the\njourney. But the East, that is swift to wrath, is very slow over\na bargain, and it is a point of doctrine besides, all the way\nfrom Gibraltar to Japan, to keep an American waiting if you hope\nto get the better of him. Ali Baba settled down for a nice long\ntalk; and you would have thought, to judge by Grim's expression,\nthat he could ask for nothing better.\n\nThe old rogue wanted to know among other things who would have\nthe task of cleaning rifles on the journey. It seemed that he was\nlong on sanctity, and not allowed by his religion to touch grease\nin any shape or form. Grim satisfied him on that point. Narayan\nSingh should clean the rifles.\n\nBut that started him off on a new trail. He tried to see how much\nmore he could impose on the Sikh, and suggested such matters as\npitching tents, cooking, gathering firewood, cleaning pots and\npans, leading the pack-camels, and a host of other necessary evils.\n\n\"I shall issue all needful orders to each man,\" Grim told him\nbluntly at last.\n\n\"And what is to be done to Ali Higg?\"\n\n\"That remains to be seen.\"\n\n\"He is a devil with a cold face.\"\n\n\"So I'm told.\"\n\n\"He has more than a hundred armed men.\"\n\n\"I heard twice that number.\"\n\n\"And we shall be twenty?\"\n\n\"Twenty.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, Allah makes all things easy!\"\n\nBut that was not the last word. There was still a custom of the\ncountry to be met and overcome.\n\n\"Are the camels watered?\" Grim asked.\n\n\"Surely.\"\n\n\"Packs all ready?\"\n\n\"All tied up-everything.\"\n\n\"You're all ready to start, then?\"\n\n_\"Inshallah bukra.\"_ * [* Tomorrow, if God is willing.]\n\n\"Tomorrow won't help me,\" said Grim. \"We start tonight, at\nsundown. I'll go with you and look the camels over now.\"\n\n\"But, Jimgrim, that is impossible. My son Mahommed's second wife\nis sick--\"\n\n\"Leave him behind, then, to look after her.\"\n\n\"He will not consent to be left! Two of the camels are not paid\nfor. The man comes in the morning for his money.\"\n\n\"Leave the money here for him with Captain de Crespigny. We\nstart tonight.\"\n\n\"But what if the camels are not satisfactory?\"\n\n\"I shall see about other ones at once in that case. There'll be\ntime if we look them over now. We start tonight.\"\n\n\"I was thinking about some mules to carry an extra load or two.\"\n\n\"No. Don't want mules. Too hot for them. Besides, there's no time\nfor changing the loads over. We start tonight.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow will be a better moon, Jimgrim.\"\n\n\"We want a full moon when we get to Petra. We start tonight. Come\nalong; show me the camels.\"\n\n\"It is hot now. There is a bad stink in the stables. Better see\nthem when it gets cooler.\"\n\n\"I'm going now. Are you coming with me?\"\n\n_\"Taib._ I will show them to you. They are good ones. They\nwill make you proud. Better give them another night's rest,\nthough, Jimgrim.\"\n\n\"Come along. Let's look at them.\"\n\n\"One has a little girth-gall that--\"\n\n\"Ali Baba, you old rogue, we start tonight!\" said Grim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\"Trust in God, But Tie Your Camel!\"\n\n\n\nDo you believe in portents? I do. Whenever in the East the first\ntwo statements that a man has made in my presence, and that I\nhave a chance to test, prove accurate, I go ahead and bet on all\nthe rest. I don't mean by that that because a man has told the\ntruth twice he won't lie on the third and fourth occasion; for\nthe East is like the West in that respect, and usually seeks to\nturn its virtue into capital. But in a land where, as old King\nSolomon, who knew his crowd, remarked, \"All men are liars,\" you\nmust have some sort of weathervane by which to guide your\nnational optimism, so I settled on that one long ago.\n\nAli Baba had said there was a bad stink in the camel stables. A\nnatural expert in hyperbole, he had not exaggerated in the least.\nAnd he had said that they were good camels; it was true. You did\nnot need to be a camel expert to know those great long-legged\nSyrian beasts for winners. They looked like the first pick of a\nwhole country-side, as he maintained they were--twenty-five of\nthem in one string, representing an investment at after-war\nprices of the equivalent of five or six thousand U.S. dollars.\n\n\"Who has been looted to pay for these?\" asked Grim.\n\n\"Allah! You have put an end to our proper business, Jimgrim. What\ncould we do? We took our money and bought these camels, thinking\nto take a hand in the caravan trade.\"\n\nGrim looked into the old rogue's eyes and laughed.\n\n\"In the land I come from,\" he said, \"a capitalist with your\npredatory instincts would pay a lawyer by the year to tell him\njust how far he could safely go!\"\n\n\"A _wakil?\"_ sneered Ali Baba. \"The _wakils_ are all scoundrels.\nMay Allah grind their bones! No honest man can have the advantage\nof such people.\"\n\nGrim looked the loads over, but there was nothing that any one\ncould teach that gang about desert work. The goat-skin water-bags\nwere newly patched and moist; the gear was all in good shape,\nnone new, but all well-tested; and there was food enough in\ndouble sacks for twenty men for a month. Mujrim, Ali Baba's giant\noldest son, picked up the loads and turned them over for Grim\nto examine with about as much apparent effort as if he were\ntossing pillows.\n\nPresently Grim laughed again, and looked at the line of fifteen\nother sons and grandsons, all squatting in the shadow of the wall\nwatching us.\n\n\"Which is the chief Lothario?\" he asked; only he used a much more\nexpressive word than that, because the East is frank where the\nWest deals in innuendo, and vice versa.\n\n\"They are all grown men,\" said Ali Baba. \"There's a woman named\nAyisha--a Badawi (Bedouin)--who has lately come from El-Maan with\na caravan of wheat merchants.\"\n\n\"How did you know that, Jimgrim?\"\n\n\"I'm told she has been buying things in the _suk_* that no Badawi\ncould have use for, and has sent to Jerusalem for goods that\ncould not be obtained here. I want to speak with her. Has any\nof your\"--he smiled at the line of placidly contented sons\nagain--\"fathers of immorality made her acquaintance by some\nchance?\" [* Bazaar]\n\nEvery one of the sixteen sons instantly assumed an expression of\nfar-away meditation. Ali Baba looked shocked.\n\n\"I see!\" said Grim. \"Um-m-m! Well--none of my business. But one\nof you go fetch her to the governorate. You may tell her she's\nnot in trouble, but an officer wants first-hand information\nabout El-Maan.\"\n\n\"Shall my sons be seen dragging a woman through the streets?\"\nasked Ali Baba.\n\n\"Let's hope not. But I don't care to send the police. I don't\nwant to put her to indignity, you understand. Suppose you arrange\nit for me, eh?\"\n\n\"Listen, Jimgrim; that woman is a strange one! Men have spoken\nevil of her, but none can prove it. I have heard it said she has\na devil. `Trust in God, but tie your camel!' says the Book.* The\nwisest among wise men would be he who let that woman alone!\"\n\n------------\n* The Moslems attribute all their favorite proverbs to the\nKoran, whether they are in the book or, as in this case, not.\n------------\n\n\"I suppose I'll have to get Captain de Crespigny to arrange it\nfor me.\"\n\n_\"Tfu!_* There is no need for a man like you to appeal to the\ngovernor. _Taib._ It shall be done. Have no doubt of it.\"\n\n----------\n* An exclamation of contempt\n----------\n\n\"All right. Send her up to the governorate--and no delays, mind!\nWe start tonight at sundown.\"\n\nOn our way back we met Narayan Singh returning from the _suk_\nwith parcels under his arm. That in itself was a sure sign of the\nlapse of contact with law and order; in Jerusalem he would have\nhad an Arab carry them, because dignity is part of a Sikh's\nuniform. You realized without a word said that the uniform\nwould be discarded presently. He looked me up and down as the\nquartermaster eyes a new recruit, and nodded in that exasperating\nway that makes you feel as if you had been ticketed and numbered.\nIf Grim had not told me that the Sikh had been first to suggest\ntaking me to Petra I would have insulted him painstakingly there\nand then; but you learn a certain amount of self-restraint, I\nsuppose, before such a man as Narayan Singh ever approves of you\nfor any purpose.\n\nHe undid the parcels on the dining-room table in the governorate,\nand the next half-hour was spent in rigging me up as an\nascetic-looking Indian Moslem, with the aid of a white turban\nwound over a cone-shaped cap, great horn-rimmed spectacles, and\nthe comfortable, baggy garments that the un-modernized _hakim_\nwears over narrow cotton pantaloons.\n\nOver it all they put a loose, brown Bedouin cloak of camel-hair\nsuch as any man expecting to travel across deserts might invest\nin, whatever his nationality; it was hotter than Tophet, but, as\nthe Arabs say, what keeps the heat in will also keep it out. It\ngives you a feeling of carrying your home around with you\non your back, the way a snail totes its shell, and there are\nworse sensations.\n\n\"Now consider yourself a while in the mirror, sahib,\" said\nNarayan Singh. \"When a man knows how he looks he begins to\nact accordingly.\"\n\nHave you ever stopped to think how true that is? There was a\nfull-length mirror upstairs in de Crespigny's bedroom, left\nbehind by a German missionary's wife when the Turks and their\nfriends stampeded, and Narayan Singh watched while I posed in\nfront of it. Before many minutes, without any deliberately\nconscious effort on my part, gesture and attitude were molding\nthemselves to fit the costume, in somewhat the same way, I\nsuppose, that a farm-hand from Montenegro shapes himself into a\nnew American store suit.\n\n\"But it is necessary to remember!\" warned Narayan Singh. \"We\nshould have done this sooner. There should be a photograph to\ncarry with you, because a man forgets his own appearance where\nthere are no mirrors and none others resembling himself.\nHenceforward, sahib, sleeping or waking, be a _hakim!_ There is a\nchest of medicines downstairs.\"\n\nBy the time I had got down Grim had already changed into Bedouin\ndress--stepped simply out of one world into another. All he does\nis to stain his eyebrows dark, put on the clothes, and cease to\nresemble anything on earth except a desert-born Arab. I don't\nknow how long he was learning to make the transformation, but no\nman could learn the trick in twenty years unless he loved the\ndesert and the sinewy men who live in it.\n\nHe looked me over again narrowly, and then decided I must return\nupstairs and shave my head. \"The only chance you've got of not\nbeing pulled apart between four camels, or pushed over a\nprecipice, is to look like darwaish. Have Narayan Singh stain the\nback of your neck with henna--not too much of it--just a\nlittle--you're from Lahore, you know--a university product.\"\n\nBy the time I had carried out that order I could not even\nrecognize myself without the turban on. \"No matter how many\nmistakes now, Sahib!\" grinned the Sikh. \"None but a crazy Moslem\nwould travel in this sun with his head shaved. Better put a cloth\ninside the cap, thus, for greater safety.\"\n\nThe only other thing Grim did to me was to throw away my toothbrush.\n\n\"They're suspicious in these parts,\" he said. \"They'd figure it\nwas hog-bristles. You'll have to make shift with a chewed stick,\nand pick your teeth between times with a dagger the way the rest\nof us do. Hello! Here she comes. You do the honors, 'Crep; we're\nin the game from now on.\"\n\nDe Crespigny went to the door and Grim and I squatted cross-legged\nin the window-seat. I tried to feel like a middle-aged native\nof the East under the rule of that twenty-six-year-old governor;\nbut it couldn't be done. I don't know yet what the sensations\nare of, say, a bachelor of arts of Lahore University who has\nto take orders from a British subaltern. I expect you have\nto leave off pretending and really be an Indian to find out\nthat; otherwise your liking for the fellow himself offsets\nreason. No white man could have helped liking young de Crespigny.\n\nHe came in after a minute perfectly self-possessed, leading a\nyoung woman who took your breath away. I have heard all the usual\nstories about the desert women being hags, but every one of them\nwas pure fiction to me from that minute. If all the rest were\nreally what men said of them, this one was sufficiently amazing\nto redeem the lot. De Crespigny addressed her as Princess, and\nshe may have really ranked as one for all I know.\n\nShe sat on a chair, rather awkwardly, as if not used to it, and\nwe stared at her like a row of owls, she studying us in return,\nquite unabashed. The Badawi don't wear veils, and are not in the\nleast ashamed to air their curiosity. She stared uncommonly hard\nat Grim.\n\nOf middle height, supple and slender, with the grace of all\noutdoors, smiling with a dignity that did not challenge and yet\nseemed to arm her against impertinence, not very dark, except\nfor her long eyelashes--I have seen Italians and Greeks much\ndarker--she somewhat resembled the American Indian, only that her\nface was more mobile.\n\nPart of her beauty was sheer art, contrived by the cunning arrangement\nof the shawl on her head, and kohl on her eyelashes.  That young\nwoman knew every trick of deportment down to the outward thrust\nof a shapely bare foot in an upturned Turkish slipper. Her clothing\nwas linen, not black cotton that Bedouin women usually wear, and\nmuch of it was marvelously hand-embroidered; but all the jewelry\nshe wore was a necklace made of gold coins. It gave a finishing\ntouch of opulence that is the crown of finished art.\n\nBut it was her eyes that took your breath away, and she was\nperfectly aware of it; she used them as the desert does all its\nweapons, frankly and without reluctance, sparing no consideration\nfor the weak--rather looking for weakness to take advantage of\nit. They were wise--dark, deadly wise--alight with youth, and yet\namazingly acquainted with all evil that is older than the world.\nShe was obviously not in the least afraid of us.\n\n\"You are from El-Maan?\" asked de Crespigny, and she nodded.\n\n\"Did you come all this way alone?\"\n\n\"No woman travels the desert alone.\"\n\n\"Tell me how you got here.\"\n\n\"You know how I got here. I came with a caravan that carried\nwheat--the wife of the sheikh of the caravan consenting.\"\n\nShe spoke the clean concrete Arabic of the desert, that has a\ndistinct word for everything, and for every phase of everything\n--another speech altogether from the jargon of the towns.\n\n\"Are they friends of yours?\"\n\n\"Who travels with enemies?\"\n\n\"Did you know them, I mean, before you came with them?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then you are not from El-Maan?\"\n\n\"Who said I was?\"\n\n\"I thought you did.\"\n\n\"Nay, the words were yours, khawaja.\" * [* Lit., gentleman-sir]\n\n\"Please tell me where you come from.\"\n\n\"From beyond El-Maan.\"\n\nShe made a gesture with one hand and her shoulder that suggested\nillimitable distances.\n\n\"From which place beyond El-Maan?\"\n\nShe laughed, and you felt she did it not in self-defense, but out\nof sheer amusement.\n\n\"Ask the jackal where his hole is! My people live in tents.\"\n\n\"Well, Princess, tell me, at any rate, what you are doing here in\nEl-Kalil.\" [Hebron]\n\n\"Ask El-Kalil. The whole _suk_ talks of me. I have made purchases.\"\n\n\"That's what I'm getting at. You've made some unusual purchases,\nand you've sent to Jerusalem for things that people don't use as\na rule in tents out in the desert--silk stockings, for instance,\nand a phonograph with special records, and soft pillows, and\nwriting-paper, and odds and ends like that. Do you use those things?\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Do you use books in French and English?\"\n\nShe hesitated. It was the first time she had not seemed perfectly\nat ease.\n\n\"Can you even read Arabic?\"\n\nShe did not answer.\n\n\"Then the books, at any rate, are meant for some one else? Tell\nme who that some one is.\"\n\n\"Allah!\" she exploded \"May I not buy what I will, if I pay\nfor it?\"\n\nBut that was a false move. You can't upset the young British\nofficer by storming at him. De Crespigny smiled, and came back at\nher with his next question suddenly.\n\n\"Are not those things for the wife of Ali Higg, and are you not\nfrom Petra?\"\n\n\"If you know so surely whence I come, why do you ask me?\"\n\n\"Are you a slave?\"\n\n\"Allah!\"\n\n\"How many wives has Ali Higg?\"\n\n\"How should I know?\"\n\n\"Because I think you are one of his wives. Is that not so?\"\n\n\"I am Ayisha. I claim Your Honor's protection.\"\n\nThat was no false move. It was so nearly a checkmate that de\nCrespigny went to the sideboard for the silver box of cigarettes,\nto offer her one and gain time for thought.\n\nEver since the days of Ruth, and no doubt long before that, it\nhas been the first law of the desert that man or woman claiming\nprotection can no longer be treated as an enemy. It is possibly\nthe earliest form of freemasonry, and it survives.\n\nArab history is full of instances of a warrior laying down his\nlife for an enemy who has claimed protection from him. And young\nde Crespigny was ruler of the most unruly city in the Near East\nbecause he understood better than most men how to respect Arab\nprejudices. Ayisha accepted a cigarette, fitted it into a long\namber tube, and watched him.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said at last. \"If I protect you you must answer\nquestions. Are you Ali Higg's wife?\"\n\n\"Have I Your Honor's promise of protection?\"\n\n\"Yes. Are you Ali Higg's wife?\"\n\n\"I am his second wife.\"\n\n\"Thought so! And you've been sent to make purchases for\nnumber one?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"How do you propose to convey all these things back to Petra?\"\n\n\"Surely it is not difficult now that I am promised Your\nHonor's protection!\"\n\n\"My district extends half-way to Beersheba and to the eastward as\nfar as the shore of the Dead Sea--no farther,\" said de Crespigny.\n\n\"I can wait. I must wait for the purchases from Jerusalem. Sooner\nor later there will be a caravan across the desert to El-Maan. I\nhave two servants here to make inquiries for me.\"\n\n\"Yes, and two more who went to Jerusalem. Four men. Tell me this,\nPrincess Ayisha: how came Ali Higg to trust you, alone with four\nmen, on such a long and difficult journey?\"\n\n\"Is he not my lord?\"\n\n\"But the men?\"\n\n\"Is he not also their lord? And he holds their wives and sons in\ntrust at Petra.\"\n\n\"You'll admit it's unusual?\"\n\n\"Do you find it strange that a woman should be faithful to\nher lord?\"\n\n\"But to Ali Higg? He has a name--a reputation! How many wives\nhas he?\"\n\n\"The Koran permits but four. The others are not wives.\"\n\n\"And you're going back?\"\n\n_\"Inshallah.\"_ [If God is willing.]\n\nIt was obvious that no alternative would have the least appeal\nfor her.\n\n\"Well, your movements have all been known to me. Your men have\nbeen watched. The word from Jerusalem is that the two you sent\nthere have made their purchases. I heard over the telephone that\nthey are on their way here. A suggestion has been made to me\nthat you five might be held here as hostages to bring Ali\nHigg to terms.\"\n\nShe laughed. \"He would raid, and make prisoners, ten for one. If\nan exchange were not made promptly his prisoners would be put to\ntorture, and--\"\n\nDe Crespigny saw fit to bring the conversation back to its other\nfoot, as it were. Not the whole British Army was in a position\njust then to impose its will on Ali Higg, so certainly de\nCrespigny was not; and if you are any kind of real diplomatist,\nwith a career in front of you, you don't talk fight unless you\nmean it.\n\n\"But of course, as you've claimed my protection I couldn't dream\nof that,\" he assured her. \"Now, is there anything else you want\nafter those men get here from Jerusalem?\"\n\n\"Nothing else.\"\n\n\"They'll be here in an hour or so. Would you be ready to leave at\nonce for Petra?\"\n\n\"As soon as I can join a caravan.\"\n\n\"Today? This evening, for instance?\"\n\n\"Allah provide it!\"\n\n\"That's settled, then.\"\n\nHe turned toward Grim.\n\n\"This is Sheik Hajji,* Jimgrim bin Yazid of El-Abdeh, who has\ntwice made the pilgrimage to Mecca. He is my honored friend. He\nstarts tonight with a caravan toward Petra. You may travel with\nhim and be in safe hands all the way.\"\n\n----------\n* One who has made the pilgrimage to Mecca\n----------\n\nShe eyed Grim curiously, startled, it seemed to me. Then her\nexpression changed slowly to excitement, followed by a look of\nbaffling wisdom, as much as to say she knew something and would\nnot tell. I don't think it was his name that startled her; that\nsounded Arabic enough.\n\n\"What business has he at Petra?\" she asked.\n\nDe Crespigny let Grim answer that conundrum.\n\n_\"Ya sit Ayisha,\"_* said Grim, \"I carry a letter to Sheikh Ali\nHigg from some one in Arabia. I will deliver you along with the\nletter. You may have a place in my caravan--provided you have\ncamels, provisions, and a litter,\" he added; for the surest way\nto increase her already alert suspicion would have been to offer\nto provide everything. [* O lady Ayisha.]\n\n\"Let me see the letter!\"\n\nGrim produced one instantly--an envelop with a big red seal on\nit. It was marked across the top in large letters \"On His\nMajesty's Service,\" but addressed in Arabic to somebody, and as\nshe could not read she was satisfied.\n\n\"Ali Higg will hold you answerable for my safety if he has to\ndestroy armies to reach you!\" she said simply.\n\n_\"Ya sit Ayisha,\"_ Grim answered solemnly, \"may Allah turn my\nface cold if Sheikh Ali Higg shall have fault to find with me in\nthis matter!\"\n\n\"How many is in your caravan?\" she asked. \"Twenty armed men.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"I will pay for my place in the caravan, according to\nthe custom--the half now and the other half on arrival.\"\n\nWithout gesture, without moving a muscle of his face, Grim\nturned down that proposal desert-fashion, that is emphatically,\nwith a reservation.\n\n_\"Ya sit Ayisha,_ may Allah do so to me, and more, if I will\naccept a price for this. Between Ali Higg and me let this\nthing be.\"\n\n_\"Taib,\"_ she answered. \"My men shall look for camels. I will go\nwith you tonight.\"\n\nShe went away then, leaving a smile behind her that would have\ncoaxed the Sphinx, and rode down-street toward the ancient city\non a big gray donkey guarded by two Bedouins armed with swords\nand spears.\n\n\"Did I do all right?\" asked de Crespigny.\n\n\"Fine!\" Grim answered. \"You'll be ruling England one of these\ndays, 'Crep. Good job I had that letter to show her, though,\nwasn't it?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\"Ali Higg's Brains Live in a Black Tent!\"\n\n\nI hate to have to admit that there was any virtue in Suliman, or\nanything other than vice in his new chum Abdullah. The two little\ndevils stole my cigarettes, and deviled me unmercifully about my\ndisguise, making improper jokes, at which Ali Baba and his sons\nlaughed uproariously, and which they recalled at intervals for\ndays afterwards.\n\nBut almost immediately after the \"lady Ayisha\" had left the\ngovernorate I was forced to admit that the brats were useful. In\ntheir own way they served Grim as a pair of hounds work for a man\nout hunting rabbits, for they could penetrate places and be\nwelcome where a grown man would be killed--at the very least--for\nintruding or attempting to intrude. Harems, for instance. And\nthey could be naive and wheedling toward a woman when they chose.\n\nThey came in with their tongues hanging out like a pair of pups,\nand sticky with the awful stuff men sell for candy in the\nEl-Kalil bazaars. Evidently some woman had been pumping them\nfor information, and Grim made them stand in front of him\non the carpet.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nThey both spoke at once. Now and then one paused for breath and\nthen the other, but on the whole it was a neck-and-neck race to\ntell the tale first.\n\n\"There was a woman in the _suk_ who had heard of Jimgrim but\nnever saw him, and she bought us sweets and took us to her house,\nand she asked us questions about Jimgrim, and we told lies, and\nshe asked us what we were doing in El-Kalil, and we said nothing,\nand she said _wallah!_ That was very little, and then she asked\nus all over again about Jimgrim. (_Gasp_)\n\n\"So we said Jimgrim has already gone back to Jerusalem, and she\ndid not believe; but we swore by the beard of the Prophet, so she\nsaid what were we going to do now, and we said we would go to the\ngovernorate and beg for bread. (_Gasp_)\n\n\"So she said what next, and we said there is a great sheikh here\nfrom Arabia, who makes a journey to Petra, and _inshallah_ he\nwill take us with him, and she said why did we want to go to\nPetra, and we said because our mothers were carried off by the\nTurks and sold to the Arabs and _inshallah_ we should find them\nnear Petra. (_Gasp_)\"\n\n\"So far, good!\" said Grim. \"That's what she got out of you. Now\nwhat did you get out of her?\"\n\n\"She said _wallah!_ There is Ali Higg at Petra and he grinds the\nface of the poor and is a great chief and will make us prisoners\nand sell us for slaves or have us turned into eunuchs, and we\nsaid (_gasp_) that we are _msakin_* and not afraid of Ali Higg\nand he may as well have us as anybody, and if it is written that\nwe shall be eunuchs then it is written and who shall change it?\n(_Gasp_) [* Poverty-stricken]\n\n\"And she said what made us think that the great sheikh will take\nus to Petra, and we said because he had promised, but he may be a\nbig liar and we don't know yet.\"\n\n\"What kind of woman is she?\" Grim asked.\n\n\"A big fat woman with a belly like two waterbags one on top of\nthe other, thus!\"\n\n\"What is her name?\"\n\n\"She is the wife of Ismail ben Rafiki, the wool-dealer.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. Yes. Go on.\"\n\n\"So she said we should come back here and find out if the sheikh\nwill really take us and say to the sheikh (_gasp_) there is a\nlady in the city who can be of service to him in a certain matter\nand he should come back with us and we should lead him to the\nhouse and she will give us money and the sheikh will understand.\"\n\n\"Good!\" pronounced Grim. \"Not half bad. Just for that I'll go\nwith you.\"\n\nHe winked at de Crespigny, nodded to me, pulled on a black-and-white\nstriped Bedouin cloak, and went off with them at once. Whereat\nNarayan Singh came in, looking like another person altogether,\nalthough, if anything, bigger than before. He had got out of\nuniform and was dressed in a medley of Indian and Arab costume\nthat made him look like one of those slaves in the \"Arabian Nights\"\nwho cut off the heads of women. All he needed was a big curved\nsimitar to fill the bill.\n\n\"Henceforth I am the _hakim's_ servant,\" he said, showing his\nteeth in an enormous grin. \"Only,\" he added, \"since it will be I\nwho instruct the _hakim,_ in secret the sahib must listen to me.\"\n\nHe got out the medicine-chest, and being a Sikh with all of a\nsoldier's opinion of civilians proposed to teach me what the\nlabels on the little bottles stood for. Even he laughed after a\nminute or two, when he had got himself thoroughly sewed up and\ncalled each bottle by its wrong name.\n\n\"Ah! What does it matter!\" he exclaimed at last.  \"Sore\neyes--broken leg--boils--knife-wound--let it be all one. Give\nepisin salts--always episin. Then, if we are long in one place,\nso that a sick man comes a second time, swearing grievously\nbecause of episin, give croton. That person will not come again,\nbut the fame of the _hakim_ will spread far and wide.\"\n\n\"You'd much better teach me how a _hakim_ sits a camel,\"\nI suggested.\n\n\"All ways, sahib, for the _hakim_ is not seldom a _bunnia_ whose\nparents bought him education. Softer than wax is the rump of a\n_bunnia_ and one who reads books. He sits this way until the\nboils break out, and then that way until the skin chafes. Then\npresently he lies across the saddle on his belly and either prays\nor curses, according as his spirit is pious or otherwise. But the\ncamel continues to proceed, since that is its nature.\"\n\n\"Well, go on, instruct the _hakim,_ then. The sahib listens.\"\n\n\"It is well to remember there will be with us, besides those\nseventeen thieves of this place, who know who we truly are, four\nsons of the desert and a woman. Now the woman, being woman, and\nthey are all alike, will take note of the _hakim_ and pretend to\nlittle sickness for the sake of making talk. Whereas the men,\nbeing, as it were, the guardians of the woman, will be seized\nwith pride and jealousy. So that what with the woman's curiosity\nand the men's watchfulness there will be great need for discretion.\"\n\n\"How would you define discretion?\"\n\n\"In the case of the woman, insolence. In the case of the men, a\ngood humor--with perhaps some such physic for quarrelsomeness as\ncroton oil administered in their food on suitable occasion.\nWhenever they get suspicious, sahib, drench their food!\n\n\"When the woman makes great eyes and shams complaints, tell her\nwhat their cursed Prophet said of women. Never mind whether he\nsaid it or not, sahib, for she will not know the truth of it,\nnever having read the book. Only speak evil of all women, and so\nwe shall come to Ali Higg's nest in good repute.\"\n\n\"All right. I'll try not to flirt with the lady. What next?\"\n\n\"The sahib will be accused of being a Persian, and will be\ninsulted accordingly, for none loves a Persian in this land,\nIslam having two chief sects, of which the Persians chose to\nadopt the Shia faith, which is not in favor with the Sunni, who\nare most numerous and most fanatic. The less the Sunni knows of\nhis religion the more he despises a Shia; and when these people\ndespise they steal, strike, abuse, and act otherwise unseemly.\"\n\n\"But I'm not supposed to be a Persian, am I?\"\n\n\"No, for you could never act a Persian's part. But they will\naccuse you of being a Persian because you are an Indian, as I\nhave heard a man called a dago because he was born somewhere\nsouth of a certain line. When it has been established that you\nare no Persian, but an Indian, it must be remembered that there\nare only two kinds of Indians whom they do not despise, and they\nare Sikhs and Pathans--Sikhs, because a Sikh can smite three\nArabs with one hand, and the Pathan for much the same reason.\n\n\"But I must not go as a Sikh because of the religious difficulty;\nneither may you be a Pathan, because you in no way resemble one,\nnor do you speak the Pushtu tongue. But I will be a Pathan,\nbecause I can speak that language; therefore they will respect me\nas a man prone to fight readily and well. And knowing that no\nPathan would demean himself by being servant to a man of no\naccount, they will more readily respect you, although you are\nneither Sikh nor yet Pathan but are supposed to be a Punjabi\nMussulman. Therefore, sahib, you must take a middle course\nbetween peace and pugnacity, pretending on the one hand to\nrestrain my quarrelsomeness, yet on the other depending for\nsafety on my readiness to take offense--as a man who is\naccustomed to a servant of mettle.\"\n\nThe rest of his lecture was about niceties of behavior, religious\nobservances, and so on. It was a mystery how that man had never\nbeen promoted. He seemed to have eyes for everything and a memory\nfor everything that he had ever observed. The Sikh despises the\nreligion of Islam quite as fervently as the follower of the\nProphet scorns Sikhism; yet he seemed familiar with every detail\nof Moslem custom, and knew to what extent geography affected it.\nThe point he seemed to understand best was how to turn the flank\nof ignorant fanaticism.\n\n\"Whenever you make a mistake, sahib, remember this: you are\nDarwaish, which is a man who is privileged, having set behind him\nall unimportant matters. So when you are accused of not observing\nthis or that, or of acting with impropriety, confound the Bedouin\nalways by sneering at their ignorance, saying that where you come\nfrom men know what is proper. And Jimgrim, having truly made\nthe pilgrimage to Mecca, will confound them likewise, having\nknowledge, whereas most of these rascals only know by hearsay.\"\n\nI suppose he lectured me for two hours, until Grim came in\nlooking pleased with himself, followed by the two infants looking\nmuch more pleased. You can't mistake the adventurous air of an\neight-year-old with money hidden on his person, whatever his\nnationality may be. De Crespigny followed them in to learn\nthe news.\n\n\"Know anything about old Rafiki, the wool-merchant?\" Grim asked.\n\n\"Steady-going old party,\" said de Crespigny. \"Says his prayers,\ncheats his customers, keeps the curfew law, and runs a three-wife\nestablishment, I believe, in three parts of town, all according\nto the Book. Why, have you run foul of him?\"\n\n\"He has offered me ten thousand piastres to poison Ali Higg\"\n\n\"Show me the money!\" laughed de Crespigny.\n\n\"He was hardly as previous as that. His head wife bribed these\nkids to bring me to the house, and the old boy met me in the\nwool-store. Said he'd been told I was going to Petra.\n\n\"First suggestion he made was that I should take my time on the\nroad and waylay a caravan that's sure to follow. He'd no idea,\nof course, that the lady Ayisha is to travel with me. His\nlittle scheme is to provide her with camels and men on his own\naccount--mean camels and his own men, who would run away at the\nfirst sign of trouble.\n\n\"He assumes that I'm a gay Lochinvar who'd like nothing better\nthan to carry off the lady. He wants her carried off and ravished\nas a spite for Ali Higg.\n\n\"Well, I didn't exactly fall for that; said I couldn't very well\napproach Ali Higg afterward, and he admitted that relations in\nthat case might be kind o' strained. So he proposed next that I\nshould meet up with Ali Higg and poison him. He offered to\nsupply the poison--stuff that he said would make him die slowly\nin agony.\"\n\n\"What's his quarrel with Ali Higg?\"\n\n\"Seems the old boy had a daughter who was the apple of his\neye--or so he said. She was on her way down to Egypt; and I\nsuspect she did not travel by train because she's been bought by\nsome beast of a pasha. They didn't want inquiries by passport\npeople, or any interfering bunk like that.\n\n\"Anyhow, Ali Higg is quite a ladies' man, and he happened to be\ncrossing the map with part of his gang of thieves somewhere down\nBeersheba way. He agreed with the pasha on the point of taste and\ncarried off the girl. So old wool-merchant Rafiki had to refund\nthe purchase-price--not that he admitted that to me, of course.\n\n\"I suspect that's where the rub comes. If he hadn't been selling\nthe girl illegally he'd surely have complained to you about the\nrape in the first instance. As it was he couldn't think of\nanything except revenge.\n\n\"I asked him if he'd take the girl back, and he said no, what\nshould he do with her? What he wants is money, or else the\nlingering death of Ali Higg; and seeing it's about as easy to get\nmoney out of that gentleman as cream cheese out of the moon,\nhe's willing to part with a hundred pounds for either of two\nthings--the rape of Ayisha or the death of Ali Higg. On those\nterms he vows he'd die contented.\"\n\n\"If he finds out that Ayisha goes with you tonight he'll try to\ncorrupt old Ali Baba or one of his sons,\" said de Crespigny.\n\n\"Yes, and he probably will find it out. But corrupting Ali Baba\nwould take time and a lot of money; and none of his sons dares do\na thing without the old man's approval. I feel fairly sure of\nthe gang. Point is, do you know of any other gang that the\nwool-merchant could hire right now to attack us somewhere\non the road?\"\n\n\"There's none in Hebron that would dare. Plenty outside in\nthe villages.\"\n\n\"The lady Ayisha has probably told that she's going tonight,\"\nsaid Grim. \"Old Woolly-wits might not find it out until too late,\nbut I suspect his wives get all the gossip that's going. Then\nhe'll have to work fast, because we shall move fast. What\nvillages does he trade with chiefly?\"\n\n\"The Beni-Assan and the Beni-Khor.\"\n\n\"Small crowds, both of them. Counting her four fanatics, we'll be\nfour-and-twenty armed men, and tough in the bargain. Is there any\noutlying sheikh who owes old Rafiki money? Who are his wives,\nfor instance?\"\n\n\"Now you're on the track,\" said de Crespigny. \"One of his\nwives--the third, I think--is the daughter of Abbas Mahommed of\nthe Beni-Yussuf tribe. Abbas Mahommed is always in debt to him.\"\n\n\"Where's his place?\"\n\n\"Down near the lower end of the Dead Sea. Right near where you'll\nwant to pitch your first camp. Abbas Mahommed sells him camel\nwool and hides, and goes in debt in advance regularly. This\nspring, for some reason, he delivered very little, and is still\nheavily in debt to Rafiki.\"\n\n\"How many men has he?\"\n\n\"Might turn out fifty strong.\"\n\n\"That's where we're due for our first trouble, then,\" said Grim.\n\"We'll have to put one over on him. I know one way of spoiling\nfriend Rafiki's game; old Woolly-wits'll fall sure. Suppose you\ngo and see him, 'Crep, or send for him, and ask him straight out\nto provide camels for the lady Ayisha. He'll send his own men\nalong with them, of course, and give them private instructions.\nLet's see--four men and a woman plus provisions, and he'll\nprobably send five men with them--twelve camels, eh? Who else can\nraise seven good camels in this place?\"\n\n\"Easy. I know where to get 'em.\"\n\n\"Good. Hire them then. Tie them in two strings and send them out\nwith two policemen to wait for us ten miles along the road. Be\nsure they start ahead of us. Soon as we overtake them I'll\ndismiss Rafiki's men, who'll be nothing but his spies, swap the\nprincess and her four men and their loads on to the fresh beasts,\nand leave the police to chase Rafiki's experts home again. Will\nyou do that?\"\n\nIt was getting well along toward sunset, and de Crespigny had to\nhurry; but one of the advantages of being short-handed as\nadministrator of a district is that you have to keep in intimate\npersonal touch with all essentials, and there was not much that\nyoung de Crespigny did not know about getting what he wanted done\nin quick time. Within half an hour seven pretty good camels were\nsauntering southward out of Hebron, with a couple of phlegmatic\nArab policemen perched on the two leaders, and the noses of the\nothers tied to the empty saddles of the beasts ahead. They were\nneither as big nor in as good condition as old Ali Baba's\nwonderful string, but very likely better than any that the\nwool-merchant would provide, and by that much less likely to\nreduce our speed after we should make the change.\n\n\"You see how easy it is,\" said Grim, \"for a rascal like Ali Higg\nto upset a whole country-side. Here we are getting the crime of\nPalestine running in grooves, as it were, so's to regulate it\nfirst and then reduce it to reasonable proportions, and all that\nbeast needs do is steal a woman and start civil war.\"\n\nBut I did not see that the wool-merchant's private plans for\nvengeance amounted to civil war, and said so.\n\n\"Hah! Wait and see!\" said Grim. \"Woolly-wits goes after vengeance.\nSomebody gets killed. That means a blood-feud. All the relatives\nof the slain man--whether it's Ali Higg or one of his retainers\ndoesn't matter--take up arms; and all the relatives of Woolly-wits\ndo ditto. For each man killed in the war that follows the other\nside is out for the equivalent in life or goods.  Village after\nvillage gets drawn in.\n\n\"Suppose that sheikh at the south end of the Dead Sea who's in\ndebt to Woolly-wits jumps at the chance to loot our caravan and\nbag the lady, we'll be lucky if one or two of our men don't get\nscuppered. That means a blood-feud between that village and all\nold Ali Baba's clan.\n\n\"But that isn't nearly all, nor nearly the worst of it. Ali Higg\nlearns next that the Dead Sea outfit have tried to waylay his\nwife; so he takes the warpath. And instead of that making a\nthree-cornered fight of it, it might mean an offensive alliance\nbetween Ali Higg and Ali Baba's gang.\n\n\"Civil war would be a very mild name for that. There'd be brains\nbrought to bear on it. The administration might have to spend\ntwenty or thirty thousand pounds and jail a lot of estimable\nArabs. The thing to do is to stop that kind of thing before\nit happens.\"\n\n\"By corraling Ali Higg, I suppose?\" said I.\n\n\"Can't very well do that. He's a free man. Of course he's got no\nright to cross our border and steal women, but, on the other\nhand, he's made himself boss of a district that no other\ngovernment pretends to control.\n\n\"If we can catch him our side of the line he's our meat; but\nthat's reciprocal; if he can catch us on his side there's no law\nto prevent his doing what he likes with us. We've got to use our\nheads with Master Ali Higg.\"\n\nI think that was the first time it really dawned on me that this\nventure was going to be dangerous. Even so, the calmness with\nwhich Grim considered leaving law and all the means of its\nenforcement behind and crossing deserts with a gang of known\nthieves for accomplices took most of the edge off it.\n\nYou simply couldn't feel scared when that fellow smiled and\nexposed the risks in detail, even with dark coming on and the\nsound of camels being made to kneel outside the window. For Ali\nBaba had become convinced at last that Grim really intended to\nstart that night, and, making a virtue of necessity, was better\nthan punctual. The camels were groaning and swearing, as they\nalways do at the prospect of a night's work.\n\n\"As I see it, any tribe out there has as much right to elect Ali\nHigg leader as you and I have to elect a president,\" said Grim.\n\"I don't suppose they did elect him, but they'll claim they did.\nThe point is, he's got himself elected somehow. We've no veto. I\ndon't hold with murder; it sets a bad example and turns loose a\nhorde of individual trouble-makers who were under something like\ncontrol before. It might be easy to have him murdered; you see\nhow easy old Woolly-wits thought it might be. Murder has always\nbeen the solution of politics in the Old World right down to\ndate; and look where they're at in consequence!\"\n\n\"You must have some idea to go on,\" I suggested.\n\n\"What's your plan?\"\n\n\"They say I look a bit like Ali Higg.\"\n\n\"But what then? Haven't you a plan--nothing you mean to try\nfirst?\"\n\n\"Oh yes. _Chercher la femme.\"_\n\n\"So there's a woman in it?\"\n\n\"You bet! Ali Higg's no born statesman. His brains live in a\nblack tent, and he keeps 'em encouraged with French and English\nbooks bought in Jerusalem--silk stockings--gramophones--all kinds\nof things.\"\n\n\"What is she--a Turk? I've heard some of them are educated nowadays.\"\n\n\"No. And she never was a Turk. She was born in Bulgaria of\nGreco-Russo-Bulgar parents, educated at Roberts College and\nColumbia University, New York, married to a drummer in the\nshredded-codfish business, divorced--on what grounds I don't\nknow--divorced him, though, I believe came out here as war\nworker-teacher in refugee camps in Egypt--made the acquaintance\nof Ali Higg when he was prisoner of war down there--he was\nfighting for the Turks at one time--and helped him to escape.\n\n\"I've never set eyes on her, but they say she's a rare\ngood-looker and has more brains in her little finger than most\nmen keep under their hats. I'm told she has designs on the throne\nof Mesopotamia.\"\n\n\"Mespot? I thought the League of Nations was going to let the\nArabs choose their own king.\"\n\n\"Sure. And as soon as she sees that Ali Higg's pretensions don't\namount to a row of shucks I wouldn't give ten piastres for that\ngentleman's lease of life! Borgia had nothing on her, they\ntell me.\"\n\n\"So we're out to play chess with a white woman. Why didn't you\ntell me this before?\"\n\n\"What's your hurry?\" asked Grim. \"If you find out too much all at\nonce you'll lose your bearings. I'll introduce you to the lady if\nwe ever reach Petra right side up. Now let's eat, and get a move\non. A full belly for a long march! Come.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\"Go and Ask the Kites, then, At Dat Rasi\"\n\n\n\nSo far everything worked out strictly according to plan. We had\nhardly finished a hurried meal when the lady Ayisha and her men\narrived on mean baggage camels provided by old Rafiki; and they\nwere not in the least pleased with their mounts, for a baggage\ncamel is as different from a beast trained to carry a rider as an\nup-to-date limousine is from a Chinese one-wheel barrow. Perched\non top of the lady Ayisha's beast was a thing they call a\n_shibrayah_--a sort of tent with a top like an umbrella, resting\non the loads slung to the camel's flanks. From inside that she\nwas busy abusing everybody.\n\nThere was only one good camel with her outfit--a small, blooded\nlooking Bishareen, a shade or two lighter in color than the\nrest, ridden by a wiry, mean rascal with a very black face.\nHe seemed anxious not to assert himself, for he kept his\nmount well away in the shadows, and moved off when any one\napproached him.\n\nIt was growing pitch-dark. Grim counted noses and gave the order\nto be off. Two or three men mounted, and that brought all the\nkneeling camels to their feet. One of Ali Baba's sons caught the\nbeast assigned to me, brought him round to the gate, and began\n_nakhing_ him to make him kneel again. But I know one or two\nthings about Arabs and their ways of assessing humanity.\nKnowledge is for use.\n\n\"Do you mistake me for a cripple?\" I asked, and instead of\ncontinuing to _nakh_ in the camel language he pulled the beast's\nhead down.\n\nThe trick is simple enough. You put your foot on the hollow of\nthe camel's neck and swing into the saddle as he raises his head\nagain. Men used to the desert despise you if you have to make\nyour mount kneel in order to get on his back, pretty much as\nhorsemen of other lands despise the tender foot who can't rope\nand saddle his own pony. There's no excuse for that, of course;\nit stands to reason that lots of first-class men can't mount a\ncamel standing, never having done it; but, according to desert\nlore, whoever has to make his camel kneel is a person of\nno account.\n\nSo I started off with at least one minus mark not notched against\nme. There was also an enormous feeling of relief, because I heard\nthose two brats blubbering at being left behind.\n\nAnd oh, what a start that was before the moon-rise, with the\ngreat soft-footed beasts like shadows stringing one behind\nanother into line through the streets of a city as old as\nAbraham! Utter silence, except for three camel bells with\ndifferent notes. Instant, utter severance from all the new world,\nwith its wheels that get you nowhere and conventions that have no\nmeaning except organized whimsy.\n\nPeace under the stars, wholly aloof and apart from the problem\nthat had sent us forth. And the feel under you of league-welcoming\nresilience, whatever the camels might say by way of objection.\nAnd they said a very great deal gutturally, as camels always do,\nyielding their prodigious power to our use with an incomprehensible\nmixture of grouchiness and inability to do less than their best.\n\nGrim rode in advance. His was the first camel bell that jangled\nwith a mellow note somewhere in the darkness around the turn of a\nnarrow street, or in a tunnel, where house joined house overhead.\nThe lady Ayisha's was the second bell, three beasts ahead of me;\nshe being the guest of honor as it were, or, rather, the prize\npassenger, it was important to know her whereabouts at any given\nmoment. And last of all came old Ali Baba with the third bell\nannouncing that all were present and correct. He and his men sat\ntheir camels with a stately pride more than half due to the\nrifles and bandoliers that had been served out.\n\nThat black-faced fellow on the little Bishareen did not trouble\nhimself about position in the line as long as we wound through\nthe city streets. He was next in front of me, and I saw him\nexchange signals with a fat man in a house door, who may have\nbeen Rafiki the wool-merchant. Narayan Singh was next behind me,\nand I looked back to make sure that he had seen the signal too.\n\nBut when we passed out of the city at the south end and began to\nswing along a white road at a clip that was plenty fast enough\nfor the baggage beasts, the man in front of me urged his beast\nforward, thrusting others out of the way and getting thoroughly\nwell cursed for it, until he rode next behind Grim.\n\nSeeing that, Narayan Singh rode after him, flogging furiously,\nand got well cursed too. But nothing else in particular happened\nfor several miles until we began to descend between huge hills of\nlimestone and, just as the moon rose, came on the reserve camels\nwaiting for us in the charge of two policemen in a hollow.\n\nThen there began to be happenings. First there was shrill delight\nfrom Ayisha and a chorus of approval from her four men at the prospect\nof changing to reasonably decent mounts. Then a tumult of indignation\nfrom the wool-merchant's crowd--blunt refusal by them to consent\nto any change at all--threats--abuse--arguments--the roaring of\ncamels who object on principle to everything, whatever it is,\neven to a chance to rest, because it hurts their backs to stand\nstill loaded and over it all presently Grim's voice issuing\norders in a tone he had when things go wrong.\n\nStrange that they don't choose leaders more often for their\nvoices! It's the most obvious thing in the world that a man with\na silver tongue, as they call it, can swing and sway any crowd.\nIf that man knows his own mind and has a plan worth spending\neffort on he can trumpet cohesion out of tumult and win against\nmen with twenty times his brains. I don't doubt Peter the Hermit\nhad a voice like a bellbuoy in a tide-rip. Grim pitched his above\nthe babel so that every word fell sharp, clear, and manly. They\nbegan to obey him there and then.\n\nBut he could not attend to everything at once, and while he\noversaw the changing of pack-saddles, and gave orders to the\npolicemen to ride back on the camels behind Rafiki's men and see\nthem safely into the city, that black-faced fellow on the\nBishareen edged away, and in a moment was off at full gallop\nheaded southwards. Narayan Singh was the first to see him go, but\nit was half a minute before he could get near Grim and call his\nattention to it.\n\nGrim ordered three of Ali Baba's men in pursuit at once.\n\n\"Shall we shoot? Shall we slay?\" asked one of them.\n\n\"No, no. He hasn't committed any crime yet. Catch him and bring\nhim back.\"\n\n\"Crime? What is crime out here? We can kill him. But overtake him\non that beast? _Wallah!\"_\n\nThey wasted another minute arguing for leave to shoot, and by the\ntime they were off the deserter had a long start; but they rode\nwith a will when they did go.\n\nIf anything on earth looks more absurd than a ridden camel\ngalloping away in the moonlight, with his neck stretched out in\nfront of him and his four ungainly legs in the air all together,\nit is three more camels doing the same thing. They looked like a\ngiant's washing blown off the line flapping before a high wind,\nand made hardly more noise. The whack-whack-whack of sticks on\nthe beasts' rumps was as distinct as pistol-shots, but you hardly\nheard the galloping footfall.\n\nGrim went on about his business, for changing loads in the dark\nis a job that needs attention, unless you choose to have a good\nbeast lose heart before morning and lie down in the middle of the\nroad. A camel in pain from a badly cinched girth will endure it\nwithout argument for just so long; after which he quits, and\nnot all the whacking or persuading in the world will get him\nup again.\n\nAt the end of twenty minutes we were under way once more. Peace\nclosed down on us, and we swayed along under the stars in\nmajestic silence. There have been better nights since, I\nthink;  but until then that was the most glorious experience\nof a lifetime.\n\nIt is my peculiar delight to read and relive ancient history, and\nof all history books the Old Testament is vastly the most\nabsorbing--far and away the most accurate. There is a school of\nfools who set themselves up to scoff at its facts, but every new\ndiscovery only confirms the old record; and here were we\nsauntering through the night on camels over hills where the\nfathers of history fought for the first beginnings of each man's\nright to do his own thinking in his own way.\n\nAfter a while Ali Baba gave his camel bell to his oldest son\nMujrim, and forced his beast up beside mine, seeming to think\nsilence might ruin the nerve of such a raw hand as myself. Or\nperhaps it was pride of race and country that impelled him. Even\nthe meanest Arab thrills with emotion when he contemplates his\nancient heritage, just as he rages at the prospect of seeing the\nJews return to it, and Ali Baba, though a prince of thieves, was\nsurely not a man without a heart.\n\nBut the trouble with Arab as distinguished from Jewish history is\nthat too little of it was written down, and too much of it\ninvented to prove a theory--much like the stuff they put between\nthe covers of school history books--so Ali Baba's lecture,\nalthough gorgeous fiction in its way, hardly enriched knowledge.\nNot that he was free from the latterday craving for accuracy\nwhenever it might serve to bolster up the rest of the fabric.\n\n\"Yonder,\" he said, for instance, pointing toward the sky-line\nwith a dramatic sweep of his arm, \"they say that Adam and Eve are\nburied. But they lie!\"\n\nAnd having denounced that lie, he expected me to believe\neverything else he told me.\n\nAccording to him every rock we passed had its history of jinn and\nspirits as well as battles, and he knew where the tomb was of\nevery national saint and hero, every one of whom had apparently\ndied within a radius of twenty miles. Some of them had died in\ntwo or three different places as far as I could make out from his\naccount of them.\n\nAnd what Abraham had not done on those hillsides in the way of\nmiracles and war would not be worth writing in a book; whatever\ncannot be otherwise explained is set down to the Ancestor, the\nArabs ranking Abraham next after Mohammed, because the patriarch\nbuilt the Kaaba, or Mosque, at Mecca, that Mohammed centuries\nlater on adopted for his new religion.\n\nBut even Ali Baba grew tired of acting historian at last, and\nonce more silence settled down, broken only by the bells and the\ncamels' gurgling, until about midnight we overhauled the three\nmen who had been sent in chase of the fellow on the Bishareen.\nThey had lost him, and were angry; for what should a man do\nexcept be angry in such a circumstance, unless he is willing to\naccept blame?\n\n\"You should have let us shoot, Jimgrim! Once I got close enough\nto have cut his beast's legs with my sword! You think this is\nlike the city, where a policeman holds up a hand and men halt?\nHah! Wallah! It was he who drew sword, and behold my camel's nose\nwhere he slashed at it! One finger's breadth closer and I would\nhave had a sick beast on my hands--but he proved a blundering pig\nwith his weapon and only made that scratch after all.\n\n\"However, it is your fault, Jimgrim! You have made us to be\nlaughed at by that father of dunghills! His beast was the faster,\nand he got away, and vanished in the shadows.\"\n\nSo there we halted and held a conference, letting the camels\nkneel and rest for half an hour, while each man said his say\nin turn.\n\n\"That man is Rafiki's messenger,\" said Grim. \"He is on his way to\nAbbas Mahommed, Sheikh of the Beni Yussuf, who owes Rafiki money.\nI think Rafiki is offering to forgo the debt if Abbas Mahommed\nwill lie in wait for us and carry off this woman.\"\n\nHe did not ask for suggestions. There was no need. Every one of\nthose cloaked and muffled rascals had a notion of his own on the\nspur of the moment, and was eager to get it adopted.\n\n\"Allah!\" said Ali Baba. \"Let us fight, then, with Abbas Mahommed,\nand plunder his harem instead! It is simple. We come on his\nvillage before dawn when those sons of Egyptian mothers* are\nasleep. We set fire to the thatch, and thereafter act as seems\nfit, slaying some and letting others escape!\"\n\n-----------\n* To call any one an Egyptian is an Arab's notion of a perfect insult.\n-----------\n\n_\"Wallah!_ Let us ride straight through the village, set a light\nto it, and run,\" suggested Mujrim. \"There isn't a woman in that\nplace I would burden a camel with.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, we should take some women to keep as hostages\nagainst the time when a blood-feud begins.\"\n\n\"And surely we shall carry off some camels.\"\n\n\"Aye! They have a horse or two as well. Abbas Mahommed trades\nwith El-Kerak, and only last month acquired a fine brown mare\nthat caught my eye.\"\n\n\"What are fifty men! We can fight twice fifty of such spawn as\nthe Beni Yussuf.\"\n\n_\"Wallah!_ They ran when the police paid them a visit. Ran from\nthe police!\"\n\n\"Yes, and were afraid to kill the Jew who sued Abbas Mahommed in\nthe court for arrears of interest. They are cowards who dare not\ntake their sheikh's part in a dispute.\"\n\n\"Better wait until dawn, and then ride by their village and\ndefy them.\"\n\nBut the lady Ayisha had the most astonishing suggestion. She came\nout from under the curtains of the _shibrayah_ and sat against\nher camel's rump to face the circle of armed men and instruct them.\n\n_\"Taib!\"_ she said scornfully. \"Let this Abbas Mahommed come and\ntake me. I have a knife for his belly in any event. You go on to\nAli Higg and say his wife is in the hands of that scum. Ali Higg\ncan cross the desert in three days, and by the evening of the\nfourth day there will be no village left, nor a man to call Abbas\nMahommed by his name. If I haven't killed him already Abbas\nMahommed will be carried off to Petra with the women, who shall\nwatch what is done to him before they are apportioned with the\nother loot. That is simplest. Let Abbas Mahommed lift me if\nhe dares!\"\n\nShe was clearly a young woman not averse to experiences, as well\nas confident of her lord's good will. But Grim had the peace of\nthe border in mind; and the gang were not at all disposed to\nstand by meekly while Abbas Mahommed paid a debt so easily to a\nmere wool-merchant.\n\n\"I am an old man,\" said Ali Baba, \"and must die soon. May He Who\nnever sleeps* slay me before I see my sons afraid to fight Abbas\nMahommed and all his host!\" [* A synonym for Allah]\n\n\"Let's talk like wise men and not fools,\" proposed Grim at last,\nand since he had let them have their say first they heard him in\nsilence now. \"The difficulty is that Abbas Mahommed's village\nlies at the corner of the Dead Sea. We must turn that corner. If\nwe pass between him and the sea he has us between land and water.\nIf we journey too far south to avoid him we lose at least a day\nand tire our camels out. A forced march now would mean that we\nmust feed the camels corn, and we have none too much of it with\nus; whereas tomorrow the grazing will be passable, and farther\non, where the grazing is poor, we shall need the corn.\"\n\n_\"Wallah!_ The man knows.\"\n\n_\"Inshalla,_ let there be a fight then!\"\n\n\"Wait!\" counseled Ali Baba. \"I know this Jimgrim. There will be a\ndeception and a ruse, but no fight. Listen to him. Wait and see!\"\n\n\"I think we will travel to the southward,\" said Grim, \"and halt\nat dawn out of sight of Abbas Mahommed's village. There let the\ncamels graze. But I, and a few of us, will take the lady Ayisha's\ncamel with the _shibriyah,_ and draw near to the village. That\nblack-faced rogue of Rafiki's will point us out to them, for he\nwill recognize the _shibriyah._\n\n\"Then when they come to seize the lady Ayisha they will find no\nwoman in the litter. So they will believe that Rafiki's messenger\nhas told lies that are blacker than his face, and will beat him\nand let us go.\"\n\n\"But if they do not let you go? They are ruffians, you know, Jimgrim.\"\n\n\"Then I shall find another way.\"\n\n\"And how will you account for being so few men, when Rafiki's\nmessenger will have said we are at least a score?\"\n\n\"Will that not be further proof that the man is a liar?\"\n\n\"If I did not know you of old I would say that is a fool's plan,\"\nremarked Ali Baba, and his sons grunted agreement. \"But you have\na devil of resourcefulness. _Taib!_ Let us try this plan and see\nwhat comes of it.\"\n\nSo we started off again to a running comment of contemptuous\ndisapproval from the lady Ayisha, who seemed to think that no\nplan could be a good one unless it entailed murder. The farther\nwe headed eastward, the nearer we came to the pale beyond which\nher lord and master's word was summary law, the more openly she\nadvocated drastic remedies for everything, and the less she was\ninclined to take no for an answer.\n\nHowever, her monologue was wasted on the moon, for no one argued\nwith her. Grim led the way-off the highroad now, and down dark\ndefiles that set the camels moaning, while their riders yelled\nalternately to Allah and apostrophized their beasts in the\nmonosyllabic camel language. Camels hate downhill work, especially\nwhen loaded, and fall unless told not to in a speech they\nunderstand, in that respect strangely like children.\n\nYou had to look out in the dark, too, for the teeth of the camel\nbehind, because they don't love the folk who drive them headlong\ninto gorges full of ghosts, and one man's thigh or elbow makes as\neasy biting as the next.\n\nCamels are no man's pets, and there is no explaining them. The\nfools will graze contentedly with shrapnel and high explosives\nbursting all about them, but go into a panic at the sight of a\npiece of paper in broad daylight. And when they think they see\nghosts in the dark they act like the Gadarene swine, only making\nmore noise about it.\n\nI wouldn't have been the lady Ayisha going down some of those\ndark places for all the wealth of ancient Bagdad. Her _shibrayah_\npitched and rolled like a small boat in a big sea, and whenever a\nrock leaned out over the narrow trail, or a scraggy old thorn\nbranch swung, it was by a combination of luck and good carpentry\nthat she was saved from being pitched down under the following\ncamel's feet. Whoever made that _shibrayah_ could have built\nthe Ark.\n\nBut we came down through one last terrific gorge on to a level\nplain, where the camel-thorn grew in clumps and the heat\nradiating from the hills was like the breath from an oven door\nbehind us. There the animals went best foot forward, as if they\nsmelled the dawn and hoped to meet it sooner by hurrying. We had\nquite a job to keep back for the loaded beasts, and three or four\nmen, instead of one, brought up the rear to prevent straggling.\n\nThen, about an hour before dawn, in a hollow between sparsely\nvegetated sand-dunes, Grim ordered camp pitched, and in very few\nminutes there was a row of little cotton tents erected, with a\nsmall fire in front of each.\n\nMost of the camels were turned out at once to graze off the\nunappetizing-looking thorns, sparse and dusty, that peppered the\nfield of view like scabs on a yellow skin. There was no fear of\ntheir wandering too far, for if the camel ever was wild, as many\nmaintain that he never was, that was so long ago that the whole\nspecies has forgotten it, and he wouldn't know what to do without\nhis owner somewhere near.\n\nHe has to be used at night, because he will not eat at night; on\nthe other hand, he refuses to sleep in the daytime; so there is a\nlimit to what you can do with a camel, in spite of his endurance,\nand once in so many days he has to be given a twenty-four hour\nrest so that he may catch up on both food and sleep.\n\nBut on the dry plains such as where we were then they give less\ntrouble than anywhere. For though they soon go sick on good corn,\nwhich a horse must have, they thrive and grow fat on desert\ngleanings; and whereas sweet water will make their bellies ache\noftener than not, the brackish, dirty stuff from wells by the\nDead Sea shore is nectar to them.\n\nHave you ever seen twenty camels rolling all at once with their\nlegs in the air, preparatory to making breakfast off dry thorns\nthat you wouldn't dare handle with gloves on? If so, you'll\nunderstand that they're the perfect opposite of every other\nuseful beast that lives.\n\nBut not all the camels were turned out. Grim chose Mujrim--Ali\nBaba's eldest son--a black-bearded, forty-year-old giant--two of\nthe younger men, Narayan Singh and me; and with the lady Ayisha's\nbeast in tow with the empty _shibrayah_ set off directly the sun\nwas a span high over the nearest dune.\n\nWe rode almost straight toward the sun, and in five minutes it\nappeared how close we were to the village whence danger might be\nexpected. It was a straggling, thatched, squalid-looking cluster\nof huts, surrounded by a mud wall with high, arched gates. Only\none minaret like a candle topped with an extinguisher pretended\nto anything like architecture, and even from where we were you\ncould see the rubbish-heaps piled outside the wall to reek and\nfester. There was a vulture on top of the minaret, and kites and\ncrows--those inevitable harbingers of man--were already busy with\nthe day's work.\n\nThe village Arabs are perfunctory about prayer, unless unctuous\nstrangers are in sight, who might criticize. So, although we\napproached at prayer-time, it was hardly a minute after we rose\nin view over a low dune before a good number of men were on the\nwall gazing in our direction. And before we had come within a\nmile of the place the west gate opened and a string of camel-men\nrode out.\n\nThe man at their head was the sheikh by the look of him, for we\ncould see his striped silk head-dress even at that distance, and\nhe seemed to have a modern rifle as against the spears and\nlong-barreled muskets of the others. There were about two-score\nof them, and they rode like the wind in a half circle, with the\nobvious intention of surrounding us. Grim led straight on.\n\nThey rode around and around us once or twice before the man in\nthe striped head-gear called a halt. He seemed disturbed by\nGrim's nonchalance, and asked our business with not more than\nhalf a challenge in his voice.\n\n\"Water,\" Grim answered. \"Did Allah make no wells in these parts?\"\n\nIt doesn't pay to do as much as even to suggest your real reason\nfor visiting an Arab village, for they won't believe you in\nany case.\n\n\"What have you in the _shibriyah?\"_\n\n\"Come and see.\"\n\nThe Sheikh Mahommed Abbas drew near alone, suspiciously, with his\ncocked rifle laid across his lap. His men began moving again,\ncircling around us slowly--I suppose with the idea of annoying\nus; for that is an old trick, to irritate your intended victim\nuntil some ill-considered word or gesture gives excuse for an\nattack. But we all sat our camels stock-still, and, following\nGrim's example, kept our rifles slung behind us.\n\nThe sheikh was a rather fine-looking fellow, except for smallpox\nmarks. He had a hard eye, and a nose like an eagle's beak; and\nthat sort of face is always wonderfully offset by a pointed black\nbeard such as he wore. But there was something about the way he\nsat his camel that suggested laziness, and his lips were not thin\nand resolute enough to my mind, to match that beard and nose. I\nwould have bet on three of a kind against him sky-high, even if\nhe had passed the draw.\n\nHe drew aside the curtain of the _shibrayah_ gingerly, as if he\nexpected a trick mechanism that might explode a bomb in his face.\n\n_\"Mashallah!_ Where is the woman?\" he exclaimed.\n\nI found out then that I was right as to the way to play that\nsupposititious poker hand. Grim had doped him out too, and\nanswered promptly without changing a muscle of his face.\n\n_\"Wallahi!_ Should I bring my wife to this place?\"\n\n\"Allah! Thy wife?\"\n\n\"Whose else?\"\n\n\"It was Ali Higg's wife according to the tale!\"\n\n\"Some fools swallow tales as the dogs eat the offal thrown to\nthem! By the beard of God's Prophet, whom do you take me for?\"\n\n_\"Kif?_* How should I know?\" [* What?]\n\n\"Go and ask the kites, then, at Dat Ras!\"\n\n\"You are he? You are he who slew the--_Shi ajib!_* Now I think of\nit they did say he was beardless. Nay! Are you--Speak! Who are\nyou?\" [* This is strange!]\n\n\"Does your wife wander abroad while you herd cattle?\" Grim\nasked him.\n\n\"Allah forbid! But--\"\n\n\"Is my honor likely less than yours?\"\n\n\"Then you are Ali Higg?\"\n\n\"Who else?\"\n\n\"And these?\"\n\n\"My servants.\"\n\n\"Your honor travels abroad with a scant escort!\"\n\n\"Let us see, then, whether it is not enough! A tale was told me\nof a black-faced liar on a Bishareen dromedary who fled hither\nfrom El-Kalil last night to persuade the dogs of this place to\nbark in some hunt of his. There was mention made of a woman. My\nmen pursued him along the road, but fear gave him wings. Hand\nhim over!\"\n\n\"Allah! He is my guest.\"\n\n\"Or let us see whether I cannot fire one shot and summon enough\nmen to eat this place!\"\n\n\"That is loud talk. They tell me you travel with but twenty.\"\n\n\"Try me!\"\n\nYou didn't have to be much of a thought-reader to know what was\npassing in that sheikh's mind. Supposing that Grim were really\nthe notorious Ali Higg, he might easily have left Hebron with\ntwenty men and have been joined by fifty or a hundred others in\nthe night. Or there might be others on the way to meet him now.\nIt was a big risk, for Ali Higg's vengeance was always the same;\nhe simply turned a horde of men loose to work their will on the\ninhabitants of any village that defied him. The sheikh was\nnot quite sure yet that he really sat face to face with the\nredoubtable robber, yet did not dare put that doubt to the test.\n\n\"Is that all Your Honor wants?\" he asked. \"Just that messenger?\"\n\n\"Him and his camel--and another thing.\"\n\n\"What else, then? We are poor folk in this place. There has been\na bad season. We have neither corn nor money.\"\n\n\"If I needed corn or money I would come and take them,\" Grim\nanswered. \"I have no present need. I give an order.\"\n\n\"Allah! What then?\"\n\n\"It pleases me to camp yonder.\"\n\nHe made a lordly motion with his head toward the west.\n\n\"This side your village, then, all this day until sundown, none\nof your people venture.\"\n\n\"But our camels go to graze that way.\"\n\n\"Not this day. Today yours graze to the eastward.\"\n\n\"There is poor grazing to the eastward.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, whoever ventures to the westward all this day does\nso in despite of me, and the village pays the price!\"\n\n\"Allah!\"\n\n\"Let Allah witness!\" answered Grim.\n\nAnd his face was an enigma; but half the puzzle was already\nsolved because there was no suggestion of weakness there. It was\nthe best piece of sheer bluffing on a weak hand that I had\never seen.\n\n\"Will Your Honor not visit my town and break bread with me?\"\nasked Mahommed Abbas.\n\n\"If I visit that dung-hill it will be to burn it,\" Grim answered.\n\"Send me out that black-faced liar and the Bishareen. I am not\npleased to wait long in the sun.\"\n\n\"If we obey the command do we not merit Your Honor's favor?\"\n\nThat was a very shrewd question. A weak man with a weak hand\nwould have walked into that trap by betraying the spirit of\ncompromise. On the other hand an ordinary bluffer would have\nblundered by overdoing the high hand.\n\n\"Consider what is known of me,\" Grim answered. \"How many have\ndisobeyed me and escaped? How many have obeyed and regretted it?\nBut by the beard of Allah's Prophet,\" he thundered suddenly, \"I\ngrow weary of words! What son of sixty dogs dares keep me waiting\nin the desert while he barks?\"\n\nMahommed Abbas did not like that medicine, especially in front of\nall his men. But they had ceased circling long ago and were\nwaiting stock-still at a respectful distance; for the name of Ali\nHigg meant evidently more to them than the honor of their own\nsheikh--which at best depends on the sheikh's own generalship. It\nwas a safe bet that if he had called on them to attack that\nminute they would have declined.\n\nSo he gave the dignified Arab salute, which Grim deigned to\nacknowledge with the slightest possible inclination of the head,\nand led his men away.\n\n\"What would you have done if he had called your bluff?\" I asked\nGrim, as soon as they were all out of earshot.\n\n\"Dunno,\" he said, smiling. \"I've learned never to try a bluff\nunless I'm pretty sure of my man. That guy doesn't own many\nchips. As a last resort I'd have to admit I'm a government\nofficer--if they hadn't killed us all first!\"\n\nWe sat our camels there for about three quarters of an hour\nbefore half a dozen of Mahommed Abbas' men appeared with Rafiki's\nmessenger riding the Bishareen between them. His face when they\nhanded him over was the color of raw liver, and if ever a man was\ntoo scared to try to escape it was he. Ali Baba's two sons got\none on either side of him without making him feel any better, for\nhe too was a Hebron man and knew them and their reputation. There\nwas nothing improbable about their throwing in their lot with the\ngreater robber Ali Higg.\n\nThen the sheikh's men tried to load gifts on Grim--chickens, a\nlive sheep, melons, vegetables, and camel milk in a gourd. Grim\ndid not even deign to acknowledge them in person, but made a\ngesture to Narayan Singh, who promptly took charge of the\nprisoner himself and sent Ali Baba's sons back for the presents.\nThey had the good grace to find fault with everything, vowing\nthat the sheep especially was only fit for vultures. However,\nwith a final sneer or two anent the donor's manners they bore\nsheep and all along behind us back to camp.\n\n\"Is it well?\" called Ali Baba, watching on the ridge of a dune,\nand coming to life like a heron as soon as we drew near.\n\n\"All's well,\" said Grim.\n\n\"Father of cunning! What now?\" the old man answered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\"Let that Mother of Snakes Beware\"\n\n\n\nThe terms that Grim had imposed on Abbas Mahommed were perfectly\nwell understood by every one concerned. The Arab is an individualist\nof fervid likes and dislikes and the thing that perhaps he hates\nmost of all is to be observed by strangers; he does not like\nit even from his own people. So there was nothing incomprehensible,\nbut quite the reverse, about that requirement that none from\nthe village should trespass in our direction all that day. And,\nof course, only a bold robber conscious of his power to enforce\nthem would have dared to insist on such terms.  But it was a\ngood thing that Mahommed Abbas did not call the bluff.\n\nAs it was, we slept all morning undisturbed, with only four\nwatchers posted, relieved at intervals of one hour. And the only\ndisturbance we suffered was from the lady Ayisha, who insisted\nthat the black-faced prisoner was hers, camel and all, and that\nhe should be taken to Petra for summary execution. She threatened\nGrim with all sorts of dire reprisals in case he should let the\nman go.\n\nBut setting every other consideration aside the man would have\nbeen dangerous company on the journey. He was putting two and two\ntogether in his own mind, and was not nearly as frightened as he\nhad been. But in Hebron he could do no harm, for once the Dead\nSea should be behind us it would not matter how many people knew\nof Grim's errand, since we should travel faster than rumor\npossibly could across the desert.\n\nBut if he should get one chance to talk with the lady Ayisha's\nmen, and even cause them to suspect that Grim might be in league\nin some way with the British authorities, it would be all up with\nour prospect of deceiving folk in future. There was danger enough\nas it was that one of Ali Baba's men might make some chance\nremark that would inform Ayisha or her escort.\n\nGrim decided finally to let the man escape and gave Narayan Singh\nand me instructions how to do it. But first he satisfied Ayisha\nby giving loud orders to every one to watch the man, and by\ntelling her that he didn't care what she did with him after we\nreached Petra. Then, late in the afternoon, when Mujrim had\nrounded up the camels, a dispute was intentionally started about\nan old well, and whether a good trail to the southward did not\nmake a circuit past it. The prisoner was asked, and he said he\nknew the well. Grim called him a father of lies, which he\ncertainly was, and sent him off on the worst of the camels\nbetween Narayan Singh and me to prove his words. Ali Baba kept\nthe Bishareen.\n\nHe led us a long way out into the desert among lumpy dunes in\nwhich the salt lay in strata, and where no sweet-water well could\npossibly be, or ever could have been. It was pretty obvious that\nall he wanted was a chance to escape from us, and he began\noffering bribes the minute we were out of sight of the camp.\n\nThe bribes were all in the nature of promises, however. He hadn't\na coin or a thing except the clothes he wore, Ali Baba's gang\nhaving attended to that thoroughly.\n\n\"The wool-merchant--my master--is a rich man,\" he urged. \"Let me\ngo and he will be your friend for ever after.\"\n\n\"We have no need of friends,\" Narayan Singh answered. \"This man\nand I, being spies in the government service, on the other hand,\nare men whose friendship is of value. You can serve us in a\ncertain matter.\"\n\n\"Then give me money!\" he retorted instantly. \"He who serves the\ngovernment nowadays receives pay.\"\n\n\"The way to receive pay,\" said I, \"is to take this letter to the\ngovernor of Hebron, who will then know that a certain man is\npretending to be Ali Higg. Thus you will do the government a\ngreat service, and may receive the difference in price between\nthe Bishareen camel and that mean brute you ride now.\"\n\n\"We waste time. There is no well out here. Give me the letter!\"\n\nHe was gone in a minute, headed straight for Hebron, and Narayan\nSingh and I fired several shots in the air to let Ayisha know\nwhat a desperate pursuit we had engaged in. When we rode into\ncamp again, trying to look shamefaced, they had about finished\npacking up, so Grim had time to call us terrible names for\nAyisha's benefit--names that it would not have been safe to apply\nto any of Ali Baba's men if he had chosen them for the job.\n\nThose thieves would stand for any kind of devilry, and were\nwilling to undertake all risks at Grim's bidding. Jail, fighting,\nhardship, meant to them no more than temporary inconvenience. But\nto have asked them to let a prisoner escape, and submit to\nshameful abuse for it afterward in the presence of a woman and\nstrangers, would have been more than Arab loyalty could stand.\n\nAnd, mother of me, how that woman Ayisha did revile us! If ever\nshe had doubted we were Indians she was sure of it now. She swept\nwith her tongue the whole three hundred million Indians into one\nvile horde and de-sexed, disinherited, declassed, and damned the\nlot of us. Before you think you know anything about abuse,\nwholesale or retail, you should hear a lady of the desert\nproclaim displeasure. I wouldn't be surprised to know that the\nvery camels blushed.\n\nIt was all Narayan Singh could stand, for Ali Baba and his gang\nlaughed derisively, and no true son of the East can endure to be\nlaughed at.\n\n\"Let that mother of snakes beware!\" he growled in my ear; and\nas it turned out in the end, he did not forget the grudge he\nowed her.\n\nWe were off again a good hour before sundown, and Mahommed Abbas\nsent out a screen of camel-men to follow us for several miles.\nThey fired about twenty shots when we were well out of range, and\nboasted, as we learned afterward, of having put Ali Higg and a\nhundred men to rout.\n\nBut that did no harm. It reduced the real Ali Higg's prestige for\na while all over the countryside; and in these days of League of\nNations and mandates and whatnot it is hard enough in all\nconscience for brave villagers with muskets to find something to\nmake up songs about. De Crespigny knew the truth about it as soon\nas our \"escaped\" man got to Hebron.\n\nBefore midnight we were well south of the Dead Sea and far beyond\nthe border up to which the British mandate was supposed to be\ngoing to extend whenever the League of Nations Council should\nstop arguing. We were something like two thousand feet below\nsea-level now; but although the heat all day long under the tents\nhad been almost intolerable, the night air was actually chilly\nbecause of the tremendous evaporation. The earth was throwing off\nthe heat it had absorbed all day, and chill drafts crept from the\nmountaintops to take its place.\n\nAnd as we crossed the imaginary border in pure, mellow moonlight,\nwith our three bells clanging, you could have told its approximate\nwhereabouts by the change that came over the gang.  Even Grim's\nback, away ahead on the leading camel, assumed a jauntier\nswing. Old Ali Baba, next ahead of me, began to look ten\nyears younger, and his sons and grandsons started singing--about\nLot's wife acceptably enough, for we were near the fabled site of\nSodom and Gomorrah, and the Prophet of Islam, who had nothing if\nnot an eye for local color, incorporated that old story in\nthe Koran.\n\nThe pillar of salt that used to be called Lot's wife, and that\n\"stood there until this day,\" when the Old Testament writer\npenned his narrative, has fallen into the Dead Sea in recent\nmemory. But all that did was to set loose imagination that had\nhitherto been tied to one landmark, and Ali Baba pointed out to\nme a dozen upright piles of argillaceous strata glistening in\nmoonlight, every one of which he swore was either Lot's wife or\none of her handmaidens.\n\n\"Such should be the fate of many other women,\" he asserted\npiously. \"It would save a great deal of trouble.\"\n\nThe lady Ayisha heard that remark, and the things she said for\nthe next ten minutes about men in general and old Ali Baba in\nparticular were as poisonous as the brimstone that once rained\ndown on Sodom and Gomorrah. She seemed to have no sense of being\nunder obligation for the escort, but rather to think we were all\nin her debt for the privilege--a circumstance which appeared\nto me to bode ill for the manners of the gentry we proposed\nto visit.\n\nThereafter--I suppose since she considered she had utterly routed\nand reduced me to submission after the messenger's escape she\nsummoned me to her side, thrusting the _shibrayah_ curtains apart\nand beckoning with the fingers turned downward, Bedouin fashion.\nWe conversed quite amicably for more than an hour, she mocking my\nArabic pronunciation, but asking innumerable questions about\nIndia--who my mother was, for instance, and whether my father\nused to beat her much; what physic was used in India for\ndate-boils; why I had not stayed at home; wasn't I afraid of\nmeeting Ali Higg; and were there such great ones as he in India?\n\nSo, as there wasn't one chance in ten million of her knowing\nanything at all about India, I saw fit to explain that as a\ncockroach is to Allah so was Ali Higg to dozens of Indian bandits\nI had known. I told her tales of men's head piled mountains high,\nand of roads of corpses over which rajahs drove their chariots;\nof arenas full of tigers into which living prisoners were thrown\nonce a week; and of a sheer cliff more than a mile high, over\nwhich women were tossed to alligators.\n\nShe took it all in, but doubted demurely at the end of it whether\nall those princely Indian terrorists added together could, as she\nput it, \"reach to the middle of the thigh of Ali Higg\"!\n\nI asked her how she had come to marry the gentleman, and she\nanswered with becoming pride that he had plundered her from the\nBagdad caravan; but I think she meant by that a caravan of\nBedouin on their way from Bagdad to wherever the grazing and\nthieving were good. She had a way of her own of enlarging things.\nFinally she asked me whether I carried good poison in my chest of\nmedicines, and I told her I had some that could reach down to\nhell and kill the ifrits.\n\n\"Wallah!\" she answered. \"If you two eunuchs hadn't lost that\nprisoner we could have tested some of it on him!\"\n\nAfter that she dismissed me, I suppose that she might meditate on\npoison in the moonlight. I rode forward to take counsel with\nGrim, and some time during the night she got word with one of Ali\nBaba's younger sons. We had hardly camped an hour after dawn in\nthe red-hot foothills east of the Dead Sea when Narayan Singh\ncaught him rifling my chest, and he had the impudence to ask\nwhich were poisons and which not. Narayan Singh threatened an\nappeal to Grim, and the man apologized; but I saw Ayisha giving\nhim sweetmeats in her tent not long afterward.\n\nShe had none of the ordinary Moslem woman's notions of privacy. A\nwhole Bedouin family will live in a black tent ten by twelve, and\nthough she had picked up wondrous ideas of high estate since her\ninfancy, the desert upbringing remained. Her tent was pitched\neach day in the midst of ours, and she ordered every one about,\nGrim included, as if we were her husband's purchased slaves. And\nbecause it was Grim's idea to make use of her to gain access to\nher husband we all put up with it, fetching and carrying without\na murmur--that is to say, all except one of us.\n\nWhenever Narayan Singh had to do her bidding his great black\nbeard rumbled with discontent; and as that only amused her she\nordered him about more than any one, the others aiding and\nabetting by inventing things for him to be told to do. But it\nhardly paid her in the long run.\n\nOn the third day, when we camped by an old well that Ali Baba\nswore was the identical one made by the angel Gabriel to provide\nwater for Hagar and Ishmael--there are twenty or thirty of those\nidentical wells in Palestine alone, to say nothing of Arabia--she\nbegan to take a particular fancy to Grim and to treat him with\nmore respect, giving him the title of prince on occasion, and\nabusing the men for not attending more swiftly to his needs.\n\nNow, whatever the alleged custom of other lands may be--and I\nrefuse to be committed on that point--there is no doubt whatever\nabout the East. There it is the woman who makes the first\nadvances. Grim took to sleeping in a tent with Mujrim and\nAli Baba.\n\nConsidering the customs of that land--the savage, accepted\nway in which women swap owners when tribes are at war, and\nbetween times when the raids are made on caravan routes--it\nwould be altogether wide of the mark to blame her too severely.\nGrim is a good-looking fellow, even in the khaki officer's\nuniform that makes most Christians look alike. Disguised as\nan Arab he takes the eye of any man, to say nothing of women.\n\nThe lines of his face are just deep enough to accent the powerful\ncurve of his nose and chin; and his eyes, with their baffling\ncolor, arrest attention. Then he stands, too, in that gear like a\nscion of an ancient race, firmly, on strong feet, with his head\nheld high and arms motionless--not fidgeting with one or both\nhands, as white men usually do. The wonder really is that Ayisha\ndid not betray her designs on him sooner.\n\nNarayan Singh grew as nervous as a hen in the presence of snakes,\nfor he foresaw how Grim's star would surely wane from the moment\nany such woman as Ayisha should establish a claim on him; and he\ndid not quite realize the full extent of Grim's resourcefulness\nin making the most of a situation. Old Ali Baba's advice, on the\nother hand, was just what he would have given to any of his sons.\n\n\"Let Ali Higg keep his wives within reach if he hopes to call\nthem his! _Wallahi!_ I would laugh to see the Lion of Petra\ntearing his clothes with rage for such a matter as this!\"\n\nAnd all the gang agreed.\n\nAyisha began to question Grim openly about his home and belongings.\nShe wanted to know how many wives he had, and he told her none,\nwhich made her all the more determined. If he had affected\nsqueamishness she would have despised him, and that would\nhave been the end of her usefulness; for scorn is very close\nindeed to hate, and hate to spitefulness in the land where\nshe was raised. But he did nothing of the sort. He was as frank\nas she was, and did his fencing, as you might say, with a club.\n\n\"The desert is full of women!\" he told her on one occasion when\nshe made more than usually open overtures.\n\n\"But not such as I am!\"\n\n\"A woman's heart lies under her ribs, and who shall read it?\"\nhe answered.\n\n\"A pig can read some things!\" she retorted; for he always managed\nto keep just clear of the point where frankness might have merged\ninto poetry.\n\nHer own four armed attendants seemed to take the whole affair\nrather speculatively. She was probably in position to have them\ncrucified on her return to Petra in case they should offer\nunacceptable advice. And it may be they would have looked\nfavorably on the chance to transfer allegiance from Ali Higg to\nGrim, who had crucified nobody yet; as Ayisha's servants they\nwould doubtless go with her, should she change owners.\n\nShe asked me repeatedly for love potions, to be slipped into\nGrim's food or into his drink, and was so importunate about it\nthat, after consulting Grim, I gave her some boric powder. The\nnext morning Grim told her that her eyes were like a young\ngazelle's, so my reputation as a _hakim_ rose several degrees.\n\n\"Is he mad?\" growled Narayan Singh. \"Ah, each man has his\nweakness! He and I have played with death a dozen times, but I\nnever knew him lose his head. So he is woman-crazed? What next,\nI wonder!\"\n\nThe girl had lots of encouragement, for, not counting the younger\nmen, who were hell bent for any kind of mischief, and constantly\negged her on, old Ali Baba spent half of each day in the tent\nexpounding to Grim the ethics of such situations; and they were\nas simple as the code of Moses.\n\n\"Love thy neighbor's wife if she will let you. Defeat thy\nneighbor in all ways whenever possible. On these two hang all\namusement and prosperity.\"\n\nAnd Grim was much too wise to pretend to Ali Baba any other\nmotive than expedience. It would not have paid to take the old\nrascal too much into his confidence, because most Arabs overplay\ntheir hand; but he did drop a hint or two; and from what he told\nme I should say it was Ayisha's persistent love-making that\nprovided the first suggestion of a plan in his mind for bringing\nAli Higg to terms.\n\nBut I'm sure the plan did not really take shape until we reached\nthe sun-baked railway-line that drags its rusty length behind\nwild hills all the way from Damascus down to Mecca.\n\nSome say that the very steel of the rails is sacred because it\nwas built to carry pilgrims to the Prophet's tomb. But some say\nnot. And those who lost the carrying trade on account of it, and\nthe tribes that used to lie in wait in mountain-passes for the\nDamascus caravan in the month of pilgrimage, say distinctly not.\nBetween these two opinions there is a third, that of the gentry\nwho declare it is a curse, to be turned back on the heads of\nthose who use it.\n\nDuring four nights we climbed unlovely hills, avoiding villages--to\nthe disgust of Ali Baba's gang, who would dearly have loved to\npick a quarrel somewhere and loot. They had a thousand excuses\nfor taking another trail, declaring that Grim had lost the way\nor would lose it; that there was sweeter water elsewhere; or\nthat the hills were not so steep and hard on the camels. But\nthe moon was nearly full by then, and Grim seemed to carry a\nmap of the district in his head.\n\nWhether he went by guesswork, or really knew, we turned up\nfinally a few miles from El-Maan at the exact spot he had aimed\nfor, and pitched camp soon after dawn within fifty yards of the\ntrack. There was no water in that place and the gang grumbled\nbadly; but it was not long before the reason of his choice was\nfairly obvious.\n\nTracks across the desert have a way of curving from point to\npoint, no more following a straight course than the cow-paths\ndo in other lands. Where there is a rock, or some peculiar\nconformation of the ground to attract attention, men and beasts\nwill head for it, attracted somewhat after the fashion of a\ncompass-needle by a lodestone or lump of iron.\n\nThere was a rock shaped like a flattened egg beyond the track,\ntwo or three hundred yards away from us. It stood all alone in a\ndazzling wilderness that was doubtless green at certain seasons\nof the year, but now was bone-dry and glittering with flakes of\nmica. Close beside that ran a track worn by camels and horses,\nand the shadow of that great rock in a weary land was plainly a\nhalting-place.\n\nOur men wanted to cross over and take advantage of the shade it\nwould give as the sun climbed higher, but Grim refused to let\nthem; whereat Ayisha went into a shrewish rage, and ordered her\nfour men to take up her tent and pitch it over by the rock\nwhether Grim permitted it or not. So they obeyed her, and Grim\nsaid nothing.\n\nThe rest of us set about cooking breakfast after the morning\nprayers were over. My prayer-mat was next Narayan Singh's, and it\nwas interesting to hear him curse the Prophet _sotto voce_ while\npretending to vie with those robbers in fervid protestations of\nfaith in Islam. But more than the Prophet he cursed Ayisha,\npraying to his Hindu pantheon to wreak all wrath on her.\n\nIt was a diluted pantheon, of course, because he was a Sikh; he\nwasn't able to call on as many animal-shaped gods with as many\narms and teeth as a Bengali could have urged into action; but he\ndid his best with the technical resources at his disposal.\n\nWithout pretending to be a judge of other men's creeds, I thought\nat the time that he made a pretty workman-like hash of that\nlady's prospects, so far as his particular formula could do\nit. I jotted down some of his suggestions to the gods for\nfuture reference, and purpose to teach them to the U.S. Army\nmule-skinners next time this country goes to war.\n\nWhile we were eating breakfast in a circle in front of the tents,\nall sticking our right hands into a common mess-pan and eating\nlike wolves--you have to be awfully careful not to use your\nleft hand, and unless you eat fast you'll get less than your\nshare--there came five men on camels out of a wady--a shallow\nvalley that lay like a cut throat with red rocks on its edge\nsomething over a mile away beyond the egg-shaped rock. They were\narmed--as everybody is in those parts who hopes to live--and\nin a hurry.\n\nAyisha and her people did not see them, because the great rock\nwas in the way, but we left off eating to watch, and Grim went\ninto his tent to use field-glasses without being seen. It is not\nunheard of for an Arab sheikh to use Zeiss binoculars, but it\nmight make a stranger suspicious.\n\nThe five men came on at a gallop, sending up the dust in clouds\nlike a cruiser's smoke-screen. They seemed to take it for\ngranted that we were friends, for we were in full view and far\noutnumbered them, yet they did not check for an instant, and that\nin itself was a suspicious circumstance.\n\nThey came to a halt ten yards away from Ayisha's tent, and stared\nat her in silence, realizing, apparently for the first time, that\nthey had come within rifle-shot of strangers. We could see her\ntalking to them, but could not hear what she said. Perhaps that\nwas as well. I think that even Grim with his poker face in\nperfect working order would have been flustered if he had been\ngiven time to think. The surprise, when it came, made him brace\nhimself to meet it; and, once committed, he played with the sky\nfor a limit as usual.\n\nOne thing was quite clear: Ayisha had made herself known to them,\nand they were properly impressed. They dismounted from their\ncamels, and, after bowing to her as respectfully as any lord of\nthe desert decently could do to a woman, they left their beasts\nkneeling and started all together toward us.\n\nSo Grim went out to meet them, even outdoing their measured\ndignity, striding as if the desert were his heritage. But he went\nonly as far as the railway track, and waited; to have gone a step\nfarther would have made them think themselves his superiors. Ali\nBaba, Mujrim, Narayan Singh, and I, went out and stood behind him\nat a properly respectful distance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\"Him and Me--Same Father!\"\n\n\n\nEvery detail of a man's bearing is watched carefully in that\nland. Every action has its value. The etiquette of the desert is\nmore strict, and more dangerous to neglect, than that of palaces,\nalthough it is simpler and more to the point, being based on the\ninstinct of self-preservation.\n\nThe Arabs who approached us, having ridden straight into a trap\nfor all they knew, for they had expected friends and found\nstrangers, were even more than usually observant of formality.\nThey were fierce, fine-looking fellows, possessed of that dignity\nthat only warfare with the desert breeds, and they saluted Grim\nwith the punctilio of men who know the meaning of a fight to him\nwho doubtless understands it too. A very different matter, that,\nto raising your Stetson on Broadway, with two cops on the corner\nand the Stars and Stripes floating from the hotel roof. They eyed\nGrim the while in the same sort of way that men who might be\ncharged with trespass look at the game warden, waiting for him to\nspeak first.\n\n_\"Allah ysabbak bilkhair!\"_ he rolled out at last.\n\n_\"Allah y'a fik, ya Ali Higg!\"_ they answered one after the other.\n\nAnd then the oldest of them--a black-bearded stalwart with\nextremely aquiline nose and dark-brown eyes that fairly gleamed\nfrom under the linen head-dress, took on himself the role\nof spokesman.\n\n\"O Ali Higg! May Allah give you peace!\"\n\n\"And to you peace!\" Grim answered.\n\nI could not see Grim's face, of course, since I stood behind\nhim, but I did not detect the least movement of surprise or\nnervousness. He stood as if he were used to being called by\nthat name, but the rest of us did not dare look at one another.\nOnce across that railway-line we were in the real Ali Higg's\npreserves. It occurred to me at the moment as vastly safer to\npose as the U.S. President in Washington.\n\nStill, Grim had not actually accepted the situation yet. I\nheld my breath, trying to remember to look like a product of\nLahore University.\n\n\"We were on our way to El-Maan, O Ali Higg, not knowing that your\nhonor had a hand in this affair.\"\n\n\"Since when is a lion not called a lion?\" demanded Grim. \"Who\ngave thee leave to name me?\"\n\n\"Pardon, O Lion of Petra! But the woman yonder, boasting with\nproper pride that she is Your Honor's wife, bade us approach and\npay respect.\"\n\nOn my left I heard Narayan Singh muttering obscenities through\nset teeth. On the right old Ali Baba wore a twinkle in a wicked\neye; the rest of his face was as emotionless as the face of the\ndesert; but when an old man is amused not even the crow's-feet\ncan do less than advertise the fact.\n\n\"A woman's tongue is like a camel bell,\" said Grim. \"It clatters\nunceasingly, and none can silence without choking it. But art\nthou a woman?\"\n\n\"Pardon, O Lion of Petra!\"\n\nThere followed a long pause. When men meet in the desert it is\nonly those from the West who are in any hurry to betray their\nbusiness. There being an infinity of time, that man is a liar who\nproclaims a shortage of it.\n\n\"Will the sun not rise tomorrow?\" asks the East.\n\nGrim stood like a statue; and, judging by my own feelings, who\nhad nothing at all to do but look on, I should say that was a\ntest of strength.\n\n\"Last week the train was punctual at El-Maan--three hours after\nsunrise,\" said the spokesman at last.\n\nOn lines where there is only one train a week it is not unusual\nfor its arrival to be the chief social event on the country-side,\nbut that hardly seemed to me to account for the way those five\nmen had been driving their camels. However, as Grim knew no more\nof their business than the rest of us, and needed desperately to\nfind out, he was careful to ask no questions.\n\nNo desert responds to the inquisitive folk who camp on its edge\nand demand to be told; but it will tell you all it knows if you\nkeep quiet and govern yourself in accordance with its moods. The\nmen who live in the desert are of the same pattern--fierce, hot,\ncold, intolerant, cruel, secretive, given to covering their\ntracks, and yet not without oases that are better than much fine\ngold to the man who knows how to find them. They enjoy a proverb\nbetter than some other men like promises.\n\n\"Allah marks the flight of birds. Shall He not decree a train's\njourney?\" said Grim.\n\n_\"Inshallah,_ Lion of Petra! The train will come, when that is\nwritten, and that which is written shall befall. It is said\nthere are sons of corruption on the train, who bear much wealth\nwith them.\n\n\"It were a pity to leave all the looting to those who got to\nEl-Maan soonest. They who slay will claim the booty.\n\n\"Or does Your Honor intend to arrive afterward and claim a share,\nleaving the labor to those who seek labor? In that case we crave\npermission to join Your Honor's party. It may be we can help\nenforce Your Honor's just demands, and be recompensed accordingly?\"\n\n_\"Wallahi!\"_ Grim answered after a long pause. \"Who sets himself\nto plunder trains without my leave? Have I been such short time\nin Petra that men doubt who rules here? Have I not said the train\nshall pass El-Maan and come thus far? Who dares challenge me? Do\nI wait here for nothing? Shall I be satisfied with a string of\nempty cars?\"\n\nThe Arab turned and conferred for a moment with his four friends.\nThey shook their heads.\n\n\"O Lord of the Desert,\" he said after a minute, \"none has heard\nof this decree. Your Honor's messenger may have failed or have\nfallen into bad hands on the way. Word has not come that you\nreserve this train for your own profit. There will be fifty\nmen at El-Maan now waiting to slay certain passengers and\nplunder others.\"\n\nGrim had evidently made up his mind and had set full sail on the\ncourse indicated. I confess I shuddered at the prospect; but I\nnever saw a man look more pleased than Ali Baba, and Narayan\nSingh's face betrayed militant admiration. Nor have I ever heard\nsuch a streak of fulminous bad language as Grim swore then,\ncalling earth and all its elements to witness the brimstone anger\nof a robber chief.\n\n\"Go ye,\" he thundered, \"and tell those sons of swine that I say\nthe train shall pass to this point. And as to what happens\nthereafter that is my affair. Bid any and all who chose to\ndispute my word to look first to their wives and goods. I\nhave spoken.\"\n\nThe five men fell back a pace in consternation, no doubt\npartly affected for the sake of flattery; but they were quite\nobviously disconcerted.\n\n_\"Wallahi!_ If we go on such an errand who shall save our lives?\nWho are we to come between wolves and their prey?\"\n\n\"Say ye are my messengers,\" retorted Grim. \"Let any touch a\nmessenger of mine who dares.\"\n\n\"But they will not believe us.\"\n\n\"That is their affair. It is Allah's way to make blind those who\nit is written are to be destroyed.\"\n\n\"Nay, Lion of Petra, give a man to go with us--one whom they will\nknow and recognize. Then all shall be well.\"\n\nHave I ever said that Grim is a genius? He can take longer\nchances in a crisis with a more unerring aim than any man I ever\nknew. Surely he took one then.\n\n\"Nay,\" he laughed. \"I will send them a woman. Let us see who will\ndare gainsay the woman.\"\n\nThat was simply supreme genius. It even pleased Narayan Singh,\nsince the tables were turned on Ayisha. The only reason she could\npossibly have had for telling these men that Grim was Ali Higg\nwas to score off him, either by capturing him for herself, or in\nthe alternative by ruining him for rejecting her advances. It was\nnot clear yet which of the two she hoped to accomplish; perhaps,\nlittle savage that she was, she would have been content with\neither alternative and had simply chosen to force the issue.\n\nAt any rate Grim had passed the buck back to her. He sent me over\nto the rock to fetch her, and I found her smiling serenely, like\nthe Sphinx, only with more than a modicum of added mischief.\n\n\"Woman, the Lion of Petra summons you,\" said I.\n\nShe laughed at that as if the world were at her feet--got up, and\nstretched herself, and yawned like a lazy cat that sees the milk\nbeing set down in a saucer--straightened her dress, and nodded\nknowingly to her four men. She had evidently reached an\nunderstanding with them.\n\n\"I hasten to do my lord's bidding,\" she answered, and followed\nme back.\n\nIt calls for all your presence of mind to remember to walk in\nfront of a woman who is addressed as often as not as princess;\nbut if I had walked behind her they would have suspected me at\nonce of being no true Moslem.\n\nI returned and stood behind Grim, and she stood in front of him,\nso that I was able to see her face. It was as good as a show to\nsee her swallow back surprise and wonder at him open-eyed, as he\nplayed the part she had foisted on him and loaded her with\nthe responsibility.\n\n\"Go with these men, Ayisha, and tell those swine at El-Maan that\nI say the train shall pass unharmed as far as this point.\nMoreover, say that none may trespass. What shall take place here\nis my affair. The range of my rifle is the measure of the line\nacross which none may come.\n\n\"Stay with them, Ayisha, until the train leaves El-Maan. Then you\nmay leave your camel and return hither on the train. That is\nmy order.\"\n\nShe was bluffed. And she recognized it with a sort of dog-like\nglance of admiration. We had all her baggage, for one thing, and\nit represented more wealth than any Bedouin woman would let\ngo willingly.\n\nNow if she were to reverse what she had said, and refuse to\nadvertise Grim as Ali Higg, these five men and probably others\nwould surely denounce her to her real husband. She had no choice.\nBut she was sharp-witted, and made the most of the situation\neven so.\n\n\"Shall I go alone, my lord? Alone with these strangers?\"\n\n\"Take two of your servants.\"\n\nBut what she wanted to make sure of was that Grim might not\ndecamp with her baggage and leave her to face the consequences.\nIt seems you can fall in love in the desert without putting too\nmuch faith in masculine nature.\n\n\"Nay, give me two men I can trust. Give me that and that one.\"\n\nShe selected old Ali Baba and me; and it was a shrewd choice, for\nunless Grim was a more than usually yellow-minded rascal he was\nsurely not going to leave the captain of his gang behind. And no\ndoubt she supposed I was valuable to Grim because of the\nfriendly, confidential way in which he always treated me. In\nother words, she proposed to have two first-class hostages.\n\nGrim gave her three. He sent Ali Baba, me, and Mujrim, and\nmounted her on the Bishareen dromedary, that men might know she\nwas one whom her lord delighted to honor. She tried to get a\nchance to whisper to him, but he was too alert and acted exactly\nas if he had known her all his life, needing no explanations\nor assurances.\n\nSo off we nine rode beside the railway track, she leading, since\nshe was chief emissary, and the last I saw of Grim for a few\nhours he was squatting in the circle of remaining men, talking to\nthem as calmly as if nothing had happened.\n\nWell, there was nothing for me to do but ride forward and watch\npoints. I was a hostage without responsibility.\n\nIf Ayisha should chose to turn on us and hand me over to the\ncrowd at El-Maan I believed I would have wit enough to denounce\nher in return; and it might be that as a Darwaish I could claim\nimmunity. Failing that, I found myself able to hope with a really\nacute enthusiasm that my shrift at the crowd's hands might be\nshort. I did not want to be crucified, or pulled in pieces by\ncamels; but if mine was to be the casting vote, of the two the\ncamels had it.\n\nThere were other points to be considered. I had a rifle slung\nbehind me, and two bandoliers. However, it was highly unlikely I\nwould have a chance to use the rifle, which is an awkward weapon\nat close quarters when surrounded.\n\nBut hidden under my coat I had two repeating-pistols and a knife.\nSince a man can't prevent himself from making plans when there is\nnothing else to think about, I made up my mind finally in case of\ntrouble to let them take the rifle and the knife; they might then\nsuppose me to be disarmed. After that, if the trouble should be\ndue to Ayisha's treason, I would execute her, and shoot myself in\nthe head with the same pistol rather than submit to torture.\n\nAt the end of the first mile I drew alongside Ali Baba and passed\nhim my second pistol. It did not seem any of my business to\nadvise him what to do with it beyond hiding it under his clothes.\nThe old rascal's eyes glittered as his hand closed on it, and\nit seemed to me he understood; and so he did, but not what\nI intended.\n\nI never got the pistol back. He understood that a fool and his\nrepeater are soon parted. When I asked him for it afterward he\nvowed he had lost it, and called his son Mujrim in addition to\nAllah and Mohammed and all the saints to witness that he spoke\nvirgin truth, and, moreover, that he never lied, and would rather\ndie ten times over than play a trick on me. I have heard since\nthat he has become a very good shot with a repeating-pistol, but\nhas difficulty in stealing suitable ammunition.\n\nAyisha wasted no breath on conversation on the way, but whipped\nher camel to its utmost speed after the first mile, so that we\nhad our work cut out to keep up with her. It is aggravating to\nride a big beast and try in vain to overtake a little one; but\nshe had been born to the game, and there wasn't a man in the\nparty who could have won a race against her, whichever of the\nanimals she rode; for the camel knows quicker than a horse\nwhether his rider understands the art or not. And art it is, as\nsurely as painting or music--art that can be tediously learned in\na degree, but must be born in you if you are ever to excel at it.\n\nThe desert was all red sand now and dreary beyond human power to\nimagine. The clouds of dust we kicked up followed us, and even\nthe cloths we kept across our mouths and nostrils did not keep it\nout. You felt like a mummy riding a race in hell, and how the\ncamels managed to breathe I can't guess. The sun on our right\nhand was just at the angle where it struck your eyes under\nthe _kuffiyi._\n\nBut I was the only one who seemed at all distressed by any of\nthose inconveniences; the others accepted them as in the natural\norder of things, and my camel, realizing how I felt, galloped\nlast in the worst of the dust.\n\nEl-Maan itself was a picture of green trees above a mud wall; but\nwe did not visit it, for the station, with its hideous red\nwater-tanks, was a mile and a half to the eastward of the\nplace--a miserable, bleak, unpainted iron roof and buildings,\nwith a place alongside that had once been a Greek hotel.\n\nAt present it looked like a camel-mart; but there were dozens of\nhorses there too, gaudily turned out like the camels with red\nworsted trimmings on saddles and bridles. And as for the fifty\nmen our five new acquaintances had spoken of, there were a\nhundred and fifty if one, all herded in groups, each with\na rifle over his arm or slung across his shoulder. Their talk\nceased as we rode along the track, and those who were on the\nplatform--about half of them--eyed Ayisha with as much curiosity\nas a Bedouin taken by surprise ever permits himself to betray.\n\nShe did not give them much time for reflection, and wasted none\nwhatever on conciliation, but affronted them from camel-back,\nhaving learned that method, no doubt, from her rightful lord and\nmaster. It was obvious from the first that they all knew her\nby sight.\n\n_\"Wallahi!_ Good meat for the crows ye will all be presently! Has\nthe Lion of Petra lost his teeth that jackals hunt ahead of him?\nDid the men of Dat Ras profit by coming between him and his prey?\nGo, look at Rat Das and count the splinters of men's bones! So\nshall your bones lie--ye who tempt the wrath of Ali Higg!\"\n\nShe rode along the line, showing her little teeth like pomegranate\nseeds in a sneer that would have made a passport clerk take notice;\nand her voice was raised to a shrill, harpy scream that rasped\nunder the iron roof, so that none could have pretended he did\nnot hear.\n\n\"The Lion claims this train! The Lion of Petra lies in wait for\nit at a place of his own choosing! Who dares forestall him? Who\ndares slay one passenger, or loot one truck? Who dares? Stand\nout, whoever dares, that I may take his name back to the\nLion of Petra!\"\n\nNobody did stand out. They all herded closer together, as if in\nfear that any one left on the edge of the crowd might be assumed\nto challenge her authority. Yet they looked capable of plundering\na city, that company of stately cutthroats. Perhaps some of them\nhad seen what actually happened when Ali Higg raided Dat Ras.\nCertainly they came from scattered settlements, on which Ali Higg\ncould take detailed vengeance whenever it suited him.\n\n\"Ye know me! I wait here for the train. I shall ride on it to\nwhere the Lion of Petra waits. Who dares interfere with me or\nfollow? Let him name himself! Who dares?\"\n\nHer savagery fed itself on threats, and increased as she felt\nherself grow mistress of the situation. Partly the primitive love\nof power, partly the animal instinct to subject and oppress--pride\non top of that, and something of her sex, too, glorying in\ngiving orders to the self-styled sterner members--drove her\nto increasing frenzy.\n\nAnd it was not fear alone that impressed the crowd and impelled\nit to obedience, for those highland Bedouins are, after all, too\npractical for that. We were but nine all told, to their seven or\neight score, and they might have enforced the logic of that\nfirst, and left the threatened consequences for afterward, but\nfor the appeal of the spectacular.\n\nIt bewildered them to be harangued confidently by a woman--they\nwho were used to watching women carry loads. There was something\nrevolutionary about it that took their breath away, and swept\ntheir own determination into limbo.\n\nAs always, the men in the background, who felt they could avoid\nrecognition, were the only ones who ventured to raise objection.\nOne or two of them started to laugh, that being the best answer\nall the world over to any threat, and if the laugh had spread\nthat would likely have been the end of us. I had unslung my rifle\nand held it in full view resting on my thigh, being minded to\nlook as murderous as possible, but she stole all my thunder by\nsuddenly snatching the rifle away and drawing back its bolt to\ncock the spring with that almost effortless adroitness that comes\nof long use.\n\n\"Who laughs at the Lion of Petra's threat?\" she screamed, raising\nherself in the saddle to survey the crowd. \"Who laughs? He shall\ndie by the hand of a woman! Who laughs, I say?\"\n\nBut nobody wanted to die by a woman's hand; and nobody chose to\nslay the woman, because of the certainty of vengeance dealt by an\nexpert in terrorism. I know I didn't doubt she would have used\nthe rifle, and I don't suppose they did. If she couldn't be\nlaughed out of countenance the only alternative was bloodshed,\nand none dared show fight.\n\nOld Ali Baba worked his camel closer, and, because an Arab must\nboast at every opportunity, began to whisper in my ear.\n\n_\"Wallahi!_ Was I not wise? It was I who told her if she wanted\nour Jimgrim she should tell the world she is his wife and he the\nveritable Ali Higg! It takes an old man's tongue to guide the\ncleverest woman!\"\n\nThe train screamed then in the distance, and a Syrian station\nagent in tattered khaki uniform went through the wholly\nunnecessary process of letting down a signal. We got off the\ntrack and rode our camels round on to the platform. The crowd\ngave way before us, and Ayisha thrust herself this and that way\namong them, breaking up groups, striking me over the wrist with\nthe stick she had for flogging the camel because I tried to\nregain the rifle.\n\nBy the time the rusty, creaking, groaning rattletrap of a train\ndrew up there was not an element of cohesion left in the crowd.\nShe knew too much to drive them away to where they might have\nregained something of determination, but let them stand there\nunder her eye where they could see in herself the ruthless symbol\nof Ali Higg's ruthlessness. And not even the sight of the\nfrightened passengers, in a panic because of tales that had been\ntold them up the line, could restore their plunder-lust.\n\nAs a matter of fact that was a romantic little mixed train when\nyou come to think of it. The Arab engine-driver, piloting his\ncharge through no-man's land, where the bones of former train\ncrews lay bleaching, simply because he was an engine-driver and\nthat was his job; the freight in locked steel cars consigned by\noptimists who hoped it might reach its destination; the four\nguards armed with worn-out rifles that they did not dare use; the\nfour passenger-cars with their window-glass all shot away; the\nhalf-dozen Arab artisans carried along for makeshift repairs en\nroute; and the more than brave--the too-fatalist-to-care-much\npassengers wondering which of their number had an enemy at every\nhalting-place; and along with that the formalism--the observance\nof conventions such as blowing the whistle and pulling down the\nsignal, on a track that carried one train one way once a week; it\nmade you feel like taking off your hat to it all, reminding me in\na vague way of those Roman legionaries who kept up the semblance\nof their civilization after the power of Rome had waned.\n\nI rode over beside the engine-driver and warned him to pull out\nbefore trouble started. But he had to take in water first. And he\nseemed to be an expert in symptoms of lawlessness. Leaning his\ngrimy head and shoulders out of the cab, he looked the crowd\nover, spat, and showed his yellow teeth in a grin that vaguely\nreminded me of Grim's good-humored smile.\n\n_\"Mafish!\"_ he remarked, summing up the situation in two\nsyllables. \"Nothing doing!\"\n\nI would have given, and would give now, most of what I own for\nthat man's ability to pass such curt, comprehensive judgment\nwithout reservation, equivocation, or hesitation. I rather\nsuspect that it can only be learned by sticking to your job when\nthe rest of the world has been fooled into thinking it is making\nhistory out of talk and treason.\n\nThere was nothing whatever but water for the train to wait for.\nNobody had business at El-Maan, for the simply sufficient reason\nthat you can't do business where governments don't function,\nwhere all want everything for nothing, and whoever could pay won't.\n\nThe engine-driver's grimier assistant swung the water-spout\nclear and climbed back over the cab, cursing the view, crowds,\ncoal-dust, prospect--everything. He meant it too. When he said he\nwished the devil might pitch me into hell and roast me forever he\nwasn't exaggerating. But I got off my camel and boarded the\nengine nevertheless. Ayisha had handed over her mount to Ali Baba\nand entered the caboose, ignoring the protests of the uniformed\nconductor who, having not much faith in fortune, did not care\nwhom he offended. But he might as well have insulted a camel as\nAyisha, for all he would have gained by it.\n\nMy friend the engine-driver blew the whistle; somebody on the\nplatform tooted a silly little horn; a signal descended in the\nnear distance and we started just as I caught sight of Mujrim\ncoming to take my camel.\n\nThen it occurred to some bright genius that even if they might\nnot loot the train there was no embargo on rejoicing; and there\nwas only one way to do that. What they saw fit to rejoice about I\ndon't know, but one shot rang in the air, and a second later\nfifty bullets pierced the dinning iron roof.\n\nThat made such a lovely noise and so scared the passengers that\nthey could not resist repeating it, and by the time we had\nhauled abreast of the distance-signal there was not much of\nthe roof left.\n\nI saw Ali Baba and Mujrim take advantage of the excitement to\nstart back with the camels; and two minutes later about twenty\nmen decided to follow them at a safe distance. The rest had begun\nto scatter before the train was out of sight, and I never\nagain saw one of the five gentry who had introduced us to the\nwhole proceedings.\n\nThen my friend the engine-driver found time to be a little curious.\n\n\"What'n hell?\" he asked, in the _lingua franca_ that all Indians\nare supposed to understand.\n\nSo I answered him in the mother argot at a venture, and he bit.\n\n\"There's a man down the line a piece who'll blow your train to\nhell,\" said I, \"unless you pull up when he flags you.\"\n\n\"Son of a gun, eh?\"\n\n\"Sure bet!\"\n\n\"Where you learn English?\"\n\n\"States,\" said I. \"You been there too?\"\n\n\"Sure pop! Goin' back some time.\"\n\n\"Not if you don't stop her when you get the hint, you won't. That\nguy down there ahead means business.\"\n\nI don't think he would have dared try to run the gauntlet in any\ncase, for the best the engine could do with that load behind it\nwas a wheezy twenty miles an hour, and the track was so out of\nrepair that even that speed wasn't safe. I was willing to bet\nGrim hadn't lifted a rail or placed any obstruction in the way,\nbut the driver had no means of knowing that.\n\n\"Son of a gun, eh?\" he repeated. \"What in 'ell's 'e want?\"\n\n\"Nothing, if you pay attention to him. All he hankers for is\nhumoring. He wants to talk.\"\n\n\"Uh! What in 'ell's a matter with him?\"\n\n\"Nothing, but he'll put a crimp in your machinery unless you stay\nand chin with him.\"\n\n\"I give him dry steam. He'll run like the devil.\"\n\n\"Don't you believe it. He's wise. Better humor him.\"\n\n\"Shucks! I shoot him. I shot lots o' men.\"\n\n\"No need to shoot,\" said I. \"This is love stuff. He's got a lady\nin the last car.\"\n\n\"Oh, gal on the train, eh? All right. You climb back along the\ncars an' kick her off soon as you see him.\"\n\n\"Gosh! I'd sooner kick a nest of hornets!\"\n\n\"You her brother?\"\n\n\"Not so's you'd notice it.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"She's got my gun. Barring that we're not real close related.\"\n\n\"Uh! Those damned Bedouin fellers can't shoot for nuts. Let 'em\nfire away. I take a chance.\"\n\n\"Ever hear of Ali Higg?\" I asked him.\n\nHe turned his head from peering down the blistering hot track,\nwiped the sweat from his face and hands with a filthy rag, and\nlooked at me keenly.\n\n\"Why? You know him?\"\n\n\"Yes. I asked if you do.\"\n\n\"Son of a gun! Him and me--same father!\"\n\n\"You mean he's your brother?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"He's the man you've got to pull up for.\"\n\n\"His gal on the train?\"\n\n\"Sure thing.\"\n\nHe resumed his vigil, leaning over the side of the engine with\none hand on the throttle-lever.\n\n\"All right,\" he said. \"I stop for him. Son of a gun! If he bust\nmy train I kill the sucker!\"\n\nI never posed as much of a diplomatist, but it seemed wise to me\nin the circumstances not to offer any further information or ask\nquestions. But I was curious. It was possible that Ali Higg's\nbrother had been given the task of running that train for the\nreason that no lesser luminary would have one chance in a\nthousand of reaching the destination.\n\nI never found out whether my guess was right or not, and never\nleft off rating that engine-driver in any case as one of the\nworld's heroes. I've a notion there is a book that might be\nwritten about him and his train.\n\nA polished black dot in the distance soon increased into the\nflattened egg-shaped rock, and then we saw Grim standing on the\ntrack with all his men.\n\nThat is the safest place to stop a train from, because you avoid\na broadside from the car-windows. True to his word the driver\ncame to a standstill, and Grim came up to speak with him just as\nI jumped off. I waited, expecting to see a contretemps.\n\n\"Ya Ali Higg! You fool!\" said the driver. \"You would kill your\nown brother? You let me go!\"\n\n\"Hah! You recognize me, then?\" said Grim, coolly enough on\nthe surface.\n\nBut his poker mask was off. In that land of polygamy and\ndeportations it is frequent enough that one brother does not know\nthe other by sight; but it must be disconcerting, all the same,\nto have a supposititious brother sprung on you. He gave a\nperceptible start, as he had not done when first addressed as Ali\nHigg that day.\n\n_\"Mashallah!\"_ swore the driver. \"I would know thine evil face\nwith the meat stripped off it! Nevertheless, thou and I are\nbrothers and this is my train. So let me go!\"\n\nGrim watched Ayisha jump out of the caboose with my rifle in her\nhand, and turn to take aim at the open door, through which the\nconductor's voice came croaking blasphemy.\n\n\"All right,\" he said. \"Since thou and I are brothers, go thy way!\n_Allah ysallmak!\"_\n\nThe driver did not wait for a second hint, but shoved the lever\nover so hard that the wheels spun and the whole train came within\nan ace of bucking off the track. And before the caboose had\npassed us Ayisha was alongside Grim abusing him for not having\nbroken the locks off the steel freight-cars.\n\n\"I am a robber's wife!\" she said, stamping her foot indignantly.\n\"What sort of robber are you that let such loot pass free?\"\n\n\"Shall I rob my mother's son?\" Grim asked her. \"God forbid!\"\n\nThen he turned to me, wondering.\n\n\"Can you beat it?\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\"You Got Cold Feet?\"\n\n\n\nWe did not have to wait long for Ali Baba, Mujrim, and the\ncamels, for they had not been fools enough to dawdle, with a\nhundred and fifty balked freebooters within rifle-shot, whose\nresilient pride was likely to breed anger. You can't lead camels\nany more than horses as fast as you can ride them; unless\nstampeded they tow loggily; but the fact that two or three dozen\nmounted Arabs had elected to follow along behind and watch\nfrom a safe distance what might happen to the train had lent\nAli Baba wings.\n\nAnd the same fact gave us wings too. We were up and away at once,\nheaded eastward toward Petra, I perched on top of a baggage beast\nuntil Ali Baba could cut across at an angle and overtake us.\n\nSo those who watched no doubt confirmed the story of Ali Higg's\npresence on the scene. Had they not from the horizon seen the\ntrain stopped? Did they not with their own eyes see us scoot for\nPetra? And who else than the redoubtable Ali Higg would be likely\nto own such a string of splendid camels--he who could take what\nhe coveted, and never coveted anything except the best?\n\nThe evidence of identity was strong enough for a judge and jury.\nMen have been hanged in America on less.\n\nBut that didn't help make the rest of our course any clearer than\na fog off Sandy Hook. The real Ali Higg was in Petra like a\ndragon in a cave, and from all accounts of him he was not the\nsort of gentleman likely to lavish sweet endearments on a rival\nwho had stolen not only his thunder, but his name as well.\n\n\"When in doubt go forward\" is good law; but which is forward and\nwhich backward when you stand in the middle of a circle of doubt\nis a point that invites argument; and as soon as I could get my\nown camel I rode up beside Grim to find out whether our leader\nhad a real plan or was only guessing.\n\nBut he seemed in no doubt at all, only satisfied, with the air of\na scientist who has at last found the key to a natural puzzle. I\nfound him chuckling.\n\n\"That explains a hundred things,\" he said.\n\n\"What does?\"\n\n\"Why, my likeness to Ali Higg. It's evidently so. I've often been\nkept awake wondering why strangers--Bedouins mostly--would show\nme such deference until they found out who I really am, and after\nthat would have to be handled without gloves. It bothered me. It\nlooked as if I had some natural gift that I couldn't identify,\nand that got smothered as soon as I put mere brains to work.\n\n\"But I see now; they mistook me for the robber, and the reaction\nwhen they found out I was some one less like the devil made them\nact like school-kids who think they can guy the teacher. Now I\nunderstand, I'll do better.\"\n\n\"The point is,\" said I, \"that you're established as the robber\nnow, and here we are riding straight for his den. Can we fight\nhim and his two hundred?\"\n\n\"Fighting is a fool's game ten times out of nine,\" he answered.\n\"That's to say, it's always a fool who starts the fight. The\nwise man waits until fighting is the only resource that's\nleft to him.\"\n\n\"Why not wait, then, and watch points?\"\n\n\"Because we're not dealing with a wise man; he's only clever and\ndrastic. If we wait word's bound to reach him that some one's\nposing as himself, and he'll sally forth to make an example of\nus--do a good job of it too!\n\n\"I'd hate to be caught out in the desert with twenty men by Ali\nHigg! He's a rip-roaring typhoon. But the worst typhoon the world\never saw had a soft spot in the middle.\n\n\"You know what the Arab say? `A dog can scratch fleas, but not\nworms in his belly!' We've got to be worms in the belly of Ali\nHigg, and where the man is there will be his belly also. We've\ngot to stage what the movie people call a close-up.\"\n\nAlmost every one in the outfit had a different view of the\nsituation, although all agreed that Grim was the man to stay\nwith. Narayan Singh, growling in my ear incessantly, scented\nintrigue, and his Sikh blood tingled at the thought; he began to\nlook more tolerantly on Ayisha as a mere instrument whom Grim\nwould find some chance of using.\n\n\"For the cleverest woman whom the devil ever sent to ruin men is\nafter all but a lie that engulfs the liar. I know that man\nJimgrim. She will dig a pit, but he will not fall into it. It may\nbe that we shall all die together, but what of that?\"\n\nAyisha, on the other hand, was getting nervous. Grim avoided her.\nShe was reduced to questioning others, edging the little\nBishareen alongside each in turn. She seemed no longer able to\nsuffer the close confinement of the _shibriyah,_ but endured the\nscorching sun and desert flies with less discomfort than the rest\nof us betrayed, camels included.\n\n\"What will he do? Is he mad? Does he think that the Lion of Petra\nis a camel to be managed with a rope and a stick?\n\n\"I have given him his chance; because of my words men already\nfear him. Why doesn't he plunder, then, and run to his own home?\nWhy doesn't he talk with me and let me tell him what to do next?\nI know all these people--all their villages--everything!\"\n\n\"All women know too much, yet never what is needful,\" Ali\nBaba answered.\n\nHe was frankly jubilant. Son and grandson of robbers by\nprofession, father and grandfather of educated thieves, life\nmeant lawlessness to him, and he could see nothing but honest\npleasure and the chance of profit in Grim's predicament. He loved\nGrim, as all Arabs do love the foreigner who understands them,\ndeploring nothing except that unintelligible loyalty to a Western\ncode of morals that according to Ali Baba's lights consisted of\npure foolishness. And now, as he saw it, Grim stood committed to\na course that could only lead to trickery. And all trickery must\npave the way for plunder. And plundering was fun.\n\nHis sons and grandsons in varying degree saw matters from the old\nman's viewpoint, although, having had rather less experience of\nit, they were not quite so confident of Grim's generalship; but\nthey made up for that by perfectly dog-like devotion to \"the old\nman, their father,\" whose word and whose interpretation of the\nKoran was the only law they knew.\n\nWhat tickled their fancy most was Ali Baba's cleverness in egging\non Ayisha to advertise Grim as Ali Higg. Again and again on the\nmarch that day, in spite of the grilling heat, and thirst and\nflies, they burst into roars of laughter over it, chaffing\nAyisha's four men unmercifully.\n\nAnd after a while Mahommed, the youngest of Ali Baba's sons,\nregarded by all the others as the poet of the band and therefore\nthe least responsible and most to be humored in his whims, made\nup a song about it all. It called for something more than\nboisterous spirits; it needed the fire of enthusiasm and\ningrained pluck to set them all singing behind him in despite of\nthe desert heat and the dazzling, bleak, unwatered view. They\nsang the louder in defiance of the elements.\n\n   \"Lord of the desert is Ali Higg!\n       _Akbar! Akbar!_ *\n   Lord of the gardens of grape and fig.\n       _Akbar! Akbar!_\n   Lord of the palm and clustered date.\n   _Mishmish,_** olive and water sate\n   Hunger and thirst in Ali's gate!\n       _Akbar! Akbar!

In that land of drought and desolation the\nhighest compliment you can pay a man is to call him lord of water\nand ripening fruit.\n-------------\n\nThere was any amount more of it, but most of the rest was not\npolite enough for print, because the Arab likes to enter into\ndetails. It sounded much better in Arabic, anyhow. And more and\nmore frequently as the song grew lurid and they warmed to the\nrefrain they made their point by changing the third Akbar\ninto Jimgrim:\n\n   _\"Akbar! Akbar! Jimgrim Ali Higg!\"_\n\nIt suited their sense of humor finely to announce to the wind and\nthe kites that Grim, the strict, straight, ethical American was a\nravisher of virgins and a slitter of offenseless throats, who\nknew no mercy--a man without law in this world or prospect of\npeace in the next.\n\nWhen we reached an oasis about noon--sweet water and thirty or\nforty palm-trees--and simply had to camp there because the camels\nwere exhausted after a night and half a day of strenuous\nmarching, they were still so full of high spirits that they had\nto work them off somehow; and unwittingly I provided the excuse.\n\nI was on the lee side of a camel, opening a boil in Mujrim's leg\nwith his razor, when I caught sight of one of the younger men\ntrying to burgle the medicine-chest. I yelled at him, and\nnaturally gashed my patient's leg, who rose in giant wrath and\nwith enormous fairness smote the real culprit.\n\nThe resulting blasphemous bad language brought Ali Baba to the\nscene at once as peacemaker, with all the gang behind him; and in\na minute they had all joined hands, with Mahommed standing in the\ncenter, and were dancing like a lot of pouter-pigeons, singing a\nnew song about Mujrim's leg, and a razor, and blood on the sand,\nand palm-trees, and a saint, and my superhuman ability to let\ndaylight into the very heart of boils. You don't have to believe\nany one who tells you that Arabs haven't humor.\n\nThere were the ruins of half a dozen mud-walled huts near the\nspring in that oasis. There had once been a sort of rampart and a\ngate, but there was hardly enough of that left to show where it\nstood. The only building still quite intact was a stone tomb of\nabout the height of a man, with a plastered cupola roof; and Ali\nBaba, who always knew everything, swore that was a great saint's\ngrave, and that there was much virtue and good luck to be gained\nby praying inside the tomb. So they all took turns to go in and\npray fervently--two-bow prayers as they called them--reciting\nthereafter such scripture as Ali Baba thought suitable and\ncould remember.\n\nHunting about in the ruins I found indubitable human bones.\nAyisha, when asked about it, said that Ali Higg had raided the\nplace several months ago and killed or captured every one.\n\n\"Because he is lord of the waters,\" she explained, and seemed to\nthink that reason unassailable.\n\nThere was quite a dispute at that place as to who should stand\nfirst guard while the rest of us slept, but Grim settled it by\ncasting lots with date-stones in a way that was new, but that\nseemed to satisfy every one--especially as the first watch fell\nto Narayan Singh and me.\n\n\"That is because the rest of us said our prayers,\" explained Ali\nBaba piously.\n\nBut I think it was really because Grim knew how to play tricks\nwith the date-stones.\n\nThe Sikh and I kept making the circuit of the palm-trees and\ntalking to keep each other from getting too sleepy, for there is\nno time when desire to sleep so loads you down as in the noon\nheat after a long march. You very often can't sleep then because\nof the very heat that makes you drowsy; but the glare has been so\ntrying to your eyes that you yearn to shut them, and inertia sits\non your spine and shoulders like a load of lead.\n\n\"Thou and I must watch that woman, sahib,\" said Narayan Singh.\n\"Our Jimgrim will make use of her; but how shall he do that if\nher heart changes? As long as she hopes to snare him I am not\nafraid of her. But what if it should be she who grows afraid as\nwe get nearer to Ali Higg's nest? A woman afraid is worse than a\nman with a dagger in the dark. Suppose she bolts to Ali Higg and\nlays information against us--what then?\"\n\nI tried to argue him out of his anxiety, because I wanted to\nsleep when my turn came. My habit of never looking for trouble is\na lovely one until trouble starts; but the Sikh, being only a\nheathen, could not be persuaded; so I had to promise him that,\nturn about, four hours on and four off, he and I would watch\nAyisha faithfully until such time as Grim should make other\ndisposition of our services or there should be no more need.\n\n\"And I think, sahib, that it will be best to shoot or stab her\nwithout argument if she turns treacherous.\"\n\nBut I never stabbed or shot a woman yet. I have a loose-kneed\nprejudice against it. I said so.\n\n\"Then, sahib, if it be your turn on watch, and you detect\ntreachery, summon me, and I will send her to _Jehannum.\"_ [Hell]\n\n\"I think we ought to speak to Jimgrim about it,\" I objected. \"He\nmight have other plans.\"\n\nThe Sikh turned that over in his mind during one whole circuit of\nthe palm-trees, stroking his great beard with his right hand the\nwhile as if the friction would inspire his brain.\n\n\"Jimgrim will say she is a woman and therefore must not be killed\nin any event,\" he answered at last. \"But that is of the nature of\nhis error, all men suffering delusion in some form, since none is\nperfect. If we submit the problem to him he will answer wrongly;\nbut we shall then have received orders, which, as faithful men,\nwe must not disobey.\n\n\"As concerns ourselves, being men without specific orders on that\npoint, the question is simple: Of that woman and that man, if the\none must live and the other die, which shall it be? And I say\nJimgrim shall live, if I die afterward even by his hand for it.\"\n\nIt sounded logical. The arguments with which an unselfish, honest\nfellow deceives himself into wrong-doing always do bear quite a\nlot of investigation. But I was at sea before the mast once,\nwhere I learned painfully that the captain commands the ship; not\neven the notions of the buckiest bucko mate amount to as much as\na barnacle's bootlace if the old man disagrees from them.\n\n\"What makes you think he doesn't understand the obvious danger of\nAyisha?\" said I.\n\n\"No man from the West ever understood a woman of the East,\"\nhe answered.\n\nThat being obviously true--Adam did not understand Eve, and no\nman from anywhere has understood any woman since--I had to rack\nmy brains for a different argument.\n\n\"There are two sure ways of discovering treason,\" I said at last.\n\"One way is to pick a quarrel with the person you suspect. But\nthe safer way is to seem very friendly.\n\n\"Now--why don't you make love to her? You're a fine, big,\nhandsome man. I don't suppose she'll prefer you in her heart to\nJimgrim, but she'll not be ashamed to appear to respond, and if\nshe has evil intentions she will surely seek to take advantage of\nyour passion to forward her own plans. Seeking to make use of\nyou, she will betray herself.\"\n\n\"So speaks the jackal to the tiger. `This way, sahib! That way,\nsahib! A broad-horned sambhur to be killed, worthy of your\nhonor's strength!' Why don't you make love to her?\"\n\n\"Because I'm afraid,\" said I quite frankly. \"If I thought I could\nget away with it I'd try. But she'd laugh at me, whereas your\nattentions might flatter her.\"\n\n\"You think so?\"\n\nHe stroked his great beard again, and twisted his mustache.\n\n\"I'm sure of it.\"\n\n_\"Atcha._ We shall see. I will give the trollop that one chance.\nIt may be she will preserve her head on her shoulders yet by\nconfiding in me; for if I can forewarn Jimgrim of her plans I\nwill reckon it beneath my dignity to use a sword on her. So. It\nis settled. We shall see.\"\n\nYou know that warm glow of vanity that sweeps over you when\nanother fellow concedes your plan to be better than his? It is\nrather like the effect of certain drugs--a highly agreeable\nsensation while it lasts.\n\nBut it was tempered in my case by that reference he had made to a\njackal, and I'm still left wondering how much justice there was\nin the insinuation. Narayan Singh and I are friends right down to\nthis minute, but I am none the less conscious of a query that\nseems to spoil confidence a little.\n\nHe, being master of himself by training, and used to sleeping\nwhen he saw fit, volunteered to take the first four-hour watch on\nAyisha, so I got as much sleep as the flies and the snores of the\nrest of the gang would permit, and awoke toward evening to the\nsound of unaccustomed voices outside my tent. There was one voice\nwith a squeak in it like a rusty wheel that I had certainly never\nheard before.\n\nIt seemed we had made some prisoners. There were three seedy-looking\ncamels kneeling over by Grim's tent, and three almost as seedy-looking\nindividuals were talking to Grim in the midst of our camp, with\nmost of our gang seated in a semicircle listening. Grim had out\nhis traveling water-pipe for the sake of effect, and was puffing\naway at it while he meditated on the information that was being\ndrawn forth gradually. Ayisha was seated on the mat beside him.\n\nThe man with the squeak in his voice, who did most of the\ntalking, was a very dark-skinned fellow with a short, coal-black,\ncurly beard. He had little gold rings in his ears, and in spite\nof the filthy condition of his clothes he wore an opulent\nlook--the sort that suggests intimate acquaintance with the\nfabled riches of the East. I have seen a Moor, who hadn't a coin\nwith which to bless himself, create exactly the same impression\nby simply being dark and handsome.\n\nHe was eating dates while he talked, so I suppose Grim had been\nto some pains to make him feel welcome. But he hadn't been\nthere long.\n\n_\"Wallahi!\"_ he said as I joined the circle. \"But Your Honor is\nsurely Ali Higg, and that is the lady Ayisha! Your Honor is\npleased to pretend otherwise, but am I blind? I, who come\nstraight from Petra where Your Honor paid me, am not thus\neasily deceived!\n\n\"Lo, the good camels! It was easy to make a wide circuit, and\nreach this place a day ahead of me; but what is Your Honor's\npurpose? What do you want with me, O Lion of Petra?\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" said Grim, \"I am not Ali Higg, who styles himself\nLion of Petra.\"\n\n\"Is that not the lady Ayisha?\" he retorted. \"True, I have only\nseen you in the dark, but have I not seen her at the least ten\ntimes? Was it not she who had my servant flogged on a former\noccasion because he likened her to other women?\"\n\nGrim said nothing to that. Ayisha drew the embroidered head-cloth\nover her face, I suppose to hide a smile.\n\n\"For what purpose did you visit Petra?\" Grim inquired.\n\n_\"Mashalla!_ Did I not receive payment from Your Honor? I do\nnot understand!\"\n\n\"It is I who do not understand,\" said Grim. \"Repeat to me what\nyou did at Petra.\"\n\n\"But Your Honor knows!\"\n\n\"Very well. Return with me to Petra. I have reasons for asking.\"\n\n_\"Wallahi!_ If it suits Your Honor's humor to make me tell you a\ntenth time what I have nine times said already, I have a tongue\nthat wags. But I see that another has been telling tales of me\nbehind my back, making me out a liar for his own purposes.\n_Inshallah,_ it shall be found that my tale varies by less than\nthe ten-thousandth part of the width of a hair from what I have\ntold already.\"\n\n\"Proceed,\" said Grim. \"I listen.\"\n\n\"Thus then: While in Jaffa, having received Your Honor's letter\nby the hand of Shabbas Ali, requesting me to spy on the British\ntroops, I made all haste, laying aside my own affairs and\njourneying wherever the trail of information led me. I asked\nquestions, but was not content with asking. I went and looked. I\nmade friends with subordinate officials, some of whom I bribed to\nshow me written orders removed from the desks of commanding officers.\n\n\"I ascertained all particulars and found this to be the fact:\nThat whereas there are small bodies of troops scattered in\ncertain places, those are needed for local protection of the\nplaces where they are; and that whereas there is at Ludd an army\nof more than twenty thousand men, with guns, great store of\nsupplies, cavalry, and aeroplanes, that army is held in readiness\nto go to Egypt and cannot for the present be sent against you.\nMoreover, the long march, so difficult for guns and supply-wagons,\nfrom there to Petra, would not be attempted during the hot season.\nSo Your Honor is safe from attack.\"\n\n\"Uh! So you say!\" Grim grunted.\n\nYou could almost hear the wheels click inside his head as he\ntried to puzzle out what use to make of this man. One thing was\nclear enough: the Lion of Petra was well informed. It was\nnothing less than fact that on no account could an expedition be\nundertaken against him for a long time. And it was fair, therefore,\nto presume that in his Petra fastness the robber chief would be\nfeeling confident, and would be that much more difficult to bluff.\n\nBut it is one advantage of that land that you may be deliberate\nwithout causing impatience or losing respect. Rather the\ncontrary; the Arab values your decisions all the more for\nbeing reached after several minutes of silent thought.\n\nNeither our own gang nor the prisoner was in the least disturbed\nby Grim's taking his time, and only Narayan Singh, still\npostponing his sleep, was anxious when Ayisha leaned her head\nclose to Grim's and whispered. Grim did not nod or shake his head\nor make any recognition of her presence--for a real Arab would\nnot have dreamed of doing so--but it was she who gave him the\nright suggestion, although her intention was totally different\nfrom his.\n\n\"You lie,\" he said suddenly.\n\n\"Allah!\"\n\n\"There is an army making ready now to march on Petra.\"\n\n\"As Allah is my witness, there is no such thing.\"\n\n\"You shall return to Petra.\"\n\n\"But Your Honor knows I am in great haste. My own small affairs\nat Jaffa, God knows, have been neglected. How shall I spare time\nto return to Petra?\"\n\n\"And there you shall reverse your story.\"\n\n\"Allah!\"\n\n\"You shall tell the very numbers and equipment of the army that\nmakes ready.\"\n\n\"May He who never sleeps preserve me! Am I mad, or dreaming? In\nPetra I have told Your Honor a true tale; shall I return to Petra\nin order to tell you a lie? O Lord of the limits of the desert,\nlisten to me! I have property in Jaffa; I must attend to it.\"\n\n\"I know you have. By the wharf where the Greeks land melons from\nEgypt, isn't it? Three godowns and a cafe on the corner? A\nnice property.\"\n\nHe paused, and I think he was turning over in his mind just how\nfar it would be wise to go with all those others listening; for\nevery word he let fall was sure to be discussed and discussed\nagain at the next halting-place.\n\n\"Which is better--to return to Petra and obey, or to lose\nthat property?\"\n\n\"How shall I lose it? Hah! Your Honor is pleased to joke. You\nwill invade Palestine as far as Jaffa?\"\n\n\"For those who live under British protection and yet spy against\nthe British are not so well treated by them as those who spy on\ntheir behalf.\"\n\n\"Maybe. When they are caught! When they have caught a fox they\nmay skin him.\"\n\n\"And I am not Ali Higg, the Lion of Petra.\"\n\n\"Then who in the name of the Prophet are you, with the Lion's\nwife at your side?\"\n\n\"That is none of your business. You come back to Petra with me.\nNo, not your men; they go on. You alone. I have spoken.\"\n\nIn vain the man protested. He did not believe for a moment that\nGrim was not Ali Higg, and he felt sure that he was being\nkidnaped for some frightful fate, although Grim's mildness of\ndemeanor must have puzzled him; for according to accounts the\nreal Lion of Petra was a roaring beast.\n\nGrim assigned two men to watch him, and gave the order to strike\ncamp, refusing to listen to any further argument. And since the\nman's camels were too exhausted to march at once he ordered all\nthree left behind at the oasis and put the prisoner on one of our\nbaggage animals.\n\nJust as we were ready to start he walked over to the two men and\nthreatened them with frightful torture unless they hurried\nwestward the minute the camels were fit to move on. It was pretty\nobvious that they were only too glad to obey; and Yussuf, our\nprisoner, made obedience more certain by shouting messages to\nthem to be delivered to friends in Jaffa.\n\nSo Narayan Singh cast appraising eyes on the _shibriyah,_ and\ncurled up in it like a big dog, without troubling to ask Ayisha's\npermission. Sleep was his first intention, but he was for killing\ntwo birds with one stone; I did not realize at the time what a\nchance that was going to provide for making the first advances to\nthe lady.\n\nI rode forward beside Grim, who guided us with a compass on his\nwrist until the stars came out; and for hours on end we went side\nby side, saying nothing, listening to the monotonous jangle of\nhis camel bell and the obligato of the bells behind. It was music\nthat suited our mood, harmonizing perfectly with the solemn\nmarvel of a desert sunset and the velvety, cool silence of the\nstarlit night.\n\n\"That man Yussuf had me guessing,\" he said at last. \"I couldn't\nplace him. Knew his face, but that was all. Then she whispered\nsomething about his being a wind that carries smells from one\nvillage to the next and back again, spying against both sides at\nthe same time. Then I remembered. He used to spy for us against\nthe Turks and sell them information about us at the same time.\nNearly got shot for it, but was let off because his services had\nreally been valuable. I remember his being sent down to Jaffa and\ntold to stay put.\"\n\n\"But what in thunder are you going to do with him?\" I asked. \"He\nthinks you're Ali Higg\"\n\nGrim chuckled.\n\n\"Wonder what Ali Higg will say when he's confronted by Ali Higg!\"\n\n\"Wonder what he'll do, you mean, don't you!\"\n\n\"What d'you keep looking back for?\"\n\n\"Just keeping tabs on Ayisha.\"\n\n\"No need to worry about her. Now we've got Yussuf on our string\nit's a cinch we can use her whichever way the cat jumps. She'll\nbe afraid he'll tell tales about her.\"\n\n\"Hell!\" I said. \"It seems to me this whole procession's crazy!\nThe best we've got with us is a gang of professional thieves.\n\n\"The farther we go the more we load up with sure-fire traitors.\nFirst Ayisha; she'd cut throats at so much per. Her four men,\nwho'd change sides once an hour if they were made afraid that\noften. Now this Yussuf--a professional spy, whose habit you say\nis to betray both sides.\"\n\n\"Pretty good outfit, I'll tell the world,\" he answered.\n\n\"Good for what?\"\n\n\"You got cold feet?\"\n\n\"I've got cold judgment. We're crazy. We haven't a chance in a\nmillion of getting the best of an outlaw with two hundred men.\"\n\n\"We can try, can't we?\"\n\n\"Yes, and die, can't we!\"\n\n\"Well--we might do worse. I'd sooner croak in harness than have\nan eight-horse funeral. But say, if you don't like it you go\nback and join those two fellows at the oasis. There'll be no\nhard words.\"\n\nBut I felt too afraid of my own opinion of myself to turn back at\nthat stage of the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\"He Cools His Wrath in the Moonlight, Communing with Allah!\"\n\n\n\nNow the desert at full moon is as light as Broadway, and the only\nshadows are those the camels cast, than which there is nothing\nmore weird in the whole range of phantasmagoria. We looked like a\nstring of glistening ghosts accompanied by goblins of a fourth\ndimension mocking us, and though you couldn't see the details of\nmen's faces, looking back along the line you could see every\nmovement and distinguish man from man.\n\nAbout midnight Ayisha made up her mind to enjoy the _shibriyah,_\nmore, I suspect, for the sake of annoying the Sikh than because\nshe really wanted it. So she ranged alongside, and chiefly\nbecause I was curious and chose to be amused, but partly because\nof my league with Narayan Singh to keep watch on her, I checked\nmy protesting camel and let him drop back into place behind them.\n\nI knew Narayan Singh was awake, for I had seen the glow of his\ncigarette through the curtains ten minutes before; but he\npretended to be asleep, so that she had to get the camels flank\nto flank and put her hand inside the curtains to awake him. Then\nhe did the obvious thing and seized her hand, and I heard his\nbass voice answering her shrill protests. I don't know why, but\nthe moonlight that made all things clear seemed also to make\nwords more than usually distinct.\n\n\"Ah!\" he boomed. \"I dreamed of paradise. I awake and find a houri\nwith her hand in mine! Il-hamd'ul-illah!* I Enter, beloved! Why\nwaste the moonlight hours?\" [* Thanks be to God!]\n\n\"Pig!\" she retorted. \"Father of bristles! Let my hand go!\"\n\n\"Nay, lovely one! I awake--I see--I understand; thou art not a\nhouri after all, but that same Ayisha I have loved in secret all\nthese burning days! I, who had resolved that gold and honor were\nas feathers in the scale against thy kisses, am I blessed as last?\"\n\n\"Cursed by black ifrits, thou son of an Afghan pig! Let me go,\nand get out of that _shibriyah!\"_\n\n\"Such eyes! Behold, the moon is pale beside them, and the stars\nmere drops of sweat on the sky's dull cheek! Such loveliness as\nthine, beloved, needs a warrior to worship it--such a man as I,\nwho would cut the throats of kings for a kind word from thee!\"\n\nDon't forget, you fellows who have to call on a girl a dozen\nSunday evenings in succession before she will go to the movies or\ncondescend to sit out a dance with you, that east of the\nfifteenth meridian the situation is reversed, and the man who\nwasn't swift about his wooing would stand no chance at all.\nModesty of approach is reckoned a sure sign of unworthiness, and\ndeference as cowardice that fears to seize an opportunity.\n\n\"An Indian lover and a boasting louse are one,\" she answered;\nbut she laughed as she said it, and her voice had lost the\nshrill note.\n\n\"Hah! Try me!\" he retorted, tugging at her hand again, and\nwhether or not she tried really hard to release it she failed.\n\"Boasts should be put to the test, beloved! We of the North have\na way of understanding our performance. I would burn and lay\nwaste cities for thy sake! Come!\"\n\nHer laugh struck a bell-like note now. There was a hint of\npleasure in it, and more than a hint of thoughtfulness. You know\nthose overtones of a bell that go fading away into the infinite,\nin touch, somehow, with thoughts that haven't reached any of us\nyet except the man who made the bell.\n\n\"Ah! Afghans are all alike!\"\n\nSikhs say that of Afghans too, and Afghans say the same thing of\nthe Sikhs.\n\n\"You would say anything for me; but as for cutting throats and\nlaying waste, I myself would be the very first victim. Thy love,\nI think, would burn up and be ashes faster than the cities I\nshould never see.\"\n\n\"Cities! I will take you to all the cities! You shall have your\nwill of the richest! Covet pearls, and I will burn the feet of\njewelers until they beg you to take their costliest! Covet\nrubies, and I will plunder them from the eyes of temple gods!\nCovet gold, and I will melt down the throne of a maharajah to\nmake bracelets for your ankles!\"\n\n_\"Wallahi!_ You speak like a braggart.\"\n\n\"Braggart? I? Nay, I am a lover whose words go lamely. They are\nbut chaff blown along the wind of great accomplishment. With thee\nto fight for I would dare the very rage of Ali Higg!\"\n\nHe still held her hand. She waited about a minute before answering.\n\n\"Which Ali Higg?\" she asked at last.\n\n\"Any Ali Higg! All Ali Higgs! As lions go down beneath the feet\nof elephants so shall the Lion of Petra fail before me!\"\n\n\"One at a time!\" she laughed. \"There is one Ali Higg who could\ncommand you with a word--another who could order your carcass\nthrown to the vultures. Words first, since your boastings are all\nwords! I say that, for all your brave words, this Ali Higg who\nrides ahead of us can make you slay me for a word of praise\nfrom him.\"\n\n\"You mean, beloved, you could make me slay him for a word of\npraise from you!\" the Sikh lied glibly.\n\n\"But I might not want him slain.\"\n\n\"Have him made into a cripple, then--a ruin of a man, for daring\nto displease you!\"\n\n\"But he pleases me!\"\n\n\"Aha! I am jealous! By the beard of the Prophet, Ayisha, beware\nof my jealousy! I am a man of few words but sudden deeds! Is\nthere a man who stands in my way? May Allah show compassion on\nhim, for he is like to need it!\"\n\nHe was so fervid in his avowals that he almost convinced\nme--almost made me believe that his private agreement with\nme had been a camouflage for his real intentions.\n\nThere is precious little of which my friend Narayan Singh isn't\ncapable in the way of romantic soldiering; he ought to have been\nborn two or three hundred years ago as, in fact, according to his\nreincarnating creed, he was. Perhaps he remembers past lives so\nvividly that he lives them over again. I wish I could remember a\npast life or two.\n\nAyisha was about to answer him when Grim's shrill bosun's whistle\nthat he keeps for emergencies whined from in front, and the\nsleepy-looking line awoke with a start. Every single rifle down\nthe length of the caravan, including mine, was unslung in a\nsecond and the click of the sliding bolts was as businesslike as\nif we had been a squad on the parade-ground. Narayan Singh, rifle\nin hand, sprang on to Ayisha's little Bishareen, and she jumped\ninto the _shibriyah,_ like a pair doing stunts at the circus.\n\nSo far good. But the rest was amateurish. We milled badly. Grim\naway in front had halted to let the line close, and we swarmed\naround him like a herd of steers that smell wolves, and nobody\nseemed to know which way to look, or what to do next.\n\nI was right in the midst of the mess, with a camel on either side\ntrying to get its teeth into me, and what with Grim's shouting to\nget the tangle straightened, and our all trying to obey at once,\nit was some minutes before I got the hang of things. In fact, I\nthink I understood last.\n\nWe were already surrounded perfectly on three sides by camel-men\nwho kept out of reasonable rifle-range and stalked us like dark\nghosts from the rear. They resembled a drag-net, drawing us in\nthe direction of Petra, and the only unblocked segment of the\ncircle was exactly in front of us. Every time I tried to count\nthem there seemed more than before, and there were certainly over\na hundred.\n\nI got one close look at Grim's face, and knew he had made his\nmind up what to do; but all the men were shouting different\nadvice and it was a question whether he would be able to get\ncontrol before a disaster happened. I said nothing and did\nnothing but kept fairly close to him. Narayan Singh found his\nproper place alongside me, with the halter of Ayisha's camel in\nhis hand; and he said nothing either.\n\nSuddenly Grim reached out and seized old Ali Baba by the\nshoulder, drawing him close and growling into his ear. I could\nnot catch the words, but he repeated them again and again, and\nAli Baba nodded vehemently. Not a shot had been fired yet, for\nGrim had forbidden it, and the other side showed no disposition\nto do other than surround us at a safe distance. But I noticed\nthey were reducing their estimate of safety and seemed to be\ngradually closing in for a concerted rush from all sides at once.\n\nThen two things happened suddenly. Out of the open horizon in\nfront, from between two great mounds that looked like ant-heaps,\nthree figures emerged on camels, apparently all alone and\nunsupported. The one in the middle on the tallest camel made a\nsignal with a long strip of cloth waved like a semaphore against\nthe moonlight.\n\nInstantly the opposing force began to close in, and Ali Baba\nproved his mettle. Those sons and grandsons obeyed his order as\nefficiently as he did Grim's. They made a feint all in a cluster\ntogether straight for the widest gap in the circle behind us.\n\nThe enemy drew off to a safer distance, whereat Ali Baba wheeled\nand charged another segment of the circle, widening it again.\nStill not a shot had been fired by either side.\n\nAround Grim now were Narayan Singh, Ayisha, and myself with our\nprisoner Yussuf, and Ayisha's four. Grim watched his chance and\nsent me to bring back four of Ali Baba's men, and by the time I\nhad done that he had lessened the distance perceptibly between\nhimself and the three lone individuals in front. He was leaning\nlow over his camel, peering at the three like a seaman staring\nfrom a crow's-nest in a fog.\n\nIt was a weird business--a swiftly played chess game, almost\nnoiseless; for wherever Ali Baba charged the enemy drew off,\nwhile the rest came closer until they were charged in turn.\n\n\"It's obvious we're intended to be made prisoners,\" Grim said to\nme at last. \"But I think it's obvious we're not going to be.\"\n\nNevertheless, I understood nothing of his plan, except that our\nlittle group kept drawing closer to the three, one of whom seemed\nin command of the other side. At the moment I suspected that Grim\nwas one of those officers who are splendid at intelligence work\nand at playing a lone hand, but less than ordinary in the field;\nAli Baba looked like the man of action.\n\nWhy, with all that brave old man's ability to swing and spur his\ngang in absolute control, had not the lot of us burst through the\ncircling enemy and made a bolt for it? That was what I should\nhave done.\n\nBut suddenly Grim turned and pushed the muzzle of his pistol into\nAyisha's face as she leaned out of the _shibrayah_ to watch. It\ncaught her under the jawbone, so that she could not see what his\nfinger was doing, and did not dare try to move away.\n\n\"Now shout!\" he ordered her. \"Tell 'em your name _Wallahi!_ Yell,\nor I'll kill you.\"\n\nShe let out a bleat like a frightened goat, that might have been\naudible thirty yards away if there were no other noise.\n\n\"Louder! I'll blow your brains out if you disobey!\"\n\nSo she screamed at the top of her lungs, making her voice carry\nas all desert people can. And after she had called three times\nshe was answered by a clear, contralto woman's voice.\n\n\"Ay-ish-a! O Ay-ish-a!\"\n\n\"Jael! Jael!\" she called back; and at that the rider of the\nmiddle camel waved the cloth again.\n\nAs fast as they caught sight of it--in tens and twenties--the\noncoming riders halted.\n\nBut Ali Baba did not stand still. Neither did we. The three lone\nindividuals in front of us began to approach.\n\n\"Come on!\" said Grim. \"Now's our chance!\"\n\nAnd at last I saw his idea. I did not know which to admire more,\nthe man who had thought of it in that sudden crisis, or Ali Baba\nwho had understood so swiftly and carried out his part so well.\nBut there was no time for admiration then.\n\nAll together--Ali Baba and his men along one side of a\nright-angle and we from the other--we swooped on the three. And\nthere were nine or ten shots fired before we closed on them,\nthough none by our side.\n\nMy camel went down under me twenty yards before we reached them.\nTwo other camels were killed, and one of Ali Baba's sons was\ngrazed. But in another second we had captured two men and a\nwoman, and it was too late for the spectators to do anything,\nunless they cared to risk killing their own leader.\n\nI thrust my way on foot through the milling camels, for I wanted\nto be in at the death, as it were, and I saw Grim take the\nwoman's rifle away. She looked more surprised than any one I have\never seen--more so than a man I once saw shot in the stomach who\nlooked suddenly into the next world and did not like it.\n\n\"Shout to 'em, Jael!\" he ordered in plain English. \"Call 'em off,\nor I'll kill you! Shout to 'em; d'you hear!\"\n\n\"Ayisha! What does this mean? Ali? Ali Higg? You here? I\ndon't understand!\"\n\n\"You'll be dead before you understand if you don't call those men\noff,\" Grim answered; and his pistol demonstrated that he meant\nit, for her men were closing in on us.\n\nSo she knelt up on her camel and cried out that Ali Higg was\nthere, bidding them keep their distance.\n\n\"But what does this mean, Ali? And you speak English? Since when?\nOh, I must be mad! You are not Ali Higg! No! I see now you are\nnot, but . . .\"\n\nShe turned on Ayisha and spoke in Arabic: \"Ayisha, what does this\nmean? Answer me!\"\n\nBut Ayisha said nothing. She chose to get back between the\ncurtains of the _shibriyah,_ and I saw Narayan Singh on the far\nside whispering to her.\n\n\"For,\" as he told me afterward, \"the time to persuade a woman you\nare her friend is when she is afraid or distracted by doubt. At\nall other times she is like a leopard; but then she is like a\nlost sheep!\"\n\nThe silence was at an end now. Every one was shouting; the\nreal Ali Higg's men wanting to know what had happened, and\nAli Baba's answering them with threats if they dared disobey\nand come closer. The effect was exactly as if the figures on a\nmotion-picture screen could be heard calling back and forth.\n\nThe two men whom we had captured with the woman Jael were silent,\nstaring hard at Grim as if they saw a vision; and Yussuf, the\nprisoner we had made at the oasis, tried to talk to them, but\nthey would not listen to him; the drama was too absorbing. Jael\nherself, inclined to be panicky at first, was recovering\nself-possession by rapid stages, and grew silent.\n\nShe hardly looked like a woman until you came quite close to her,\nfor she was dressed like a man, in the regular Bedouin cloak and\nhead-gear, with a bandolier full of cartridges. But her hair\nhad come unbound, and one long reddish lock of it was over\nher shoulder.\n\nShe had a good-looking, strong face, badly freckled, and was\nprobably about forty years old, although that much was hard\nguessing in the moonlight; for the rest, she looked like the\nincarnation of activity--standing still, but only by suppression.\n\n\"Now Jael Higg,\" said Grim, \"we'll have no squeamishness about\nsex. I'm in a tight place, and you'll obey orders or take the\nconsequences. We're going to Petra, the lot of us.\"\n\n\"You! Are coming with me? To Petra?\"\n\n\"Yes. And we've escort enough. Who commands those men?\"\n\n\"I!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. But who's at the head of them now?\"\n\n\"Ibrahim ben Ah.\"\n\n\"Call out for Ibrahim ben Ah to come here to speak with Ali Higg,\nand watch that he comes alone,\" Grim ordered, and two or three of\nAli Baba's men went off to obey. \"Now, Jael, you do the talking.\nUnderstand me, though; this pistol has a way of going off quite\nsuddenly when the trigger is pressed. Answer: What village were\nyou intending to raid?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"No use lying. Ali Higg's spy brought word to him that the\nBritish are engaged elsewhere. Raid follows promptly, of course.\nNow, out with it! I don't need you at Petra; Ayisha will serve my\npurpose there. You've ten seconds before I pull the trigger.\nWhere was this raid headed for?\"\n\n\"El-Maan.\" \"Why?\"\n\n\"That place has become too independent. The tribes meet there and\nplan raids on their own account.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. That sounds fairly credible. Now, observe--I pass my\npistol to this Indian.\"\n\nHe handed it to me.\n\n\"He will shoot you dead if you make one false move. You will tell\nIbrahim ben Ah to take all his men at once to that next oasis on\nthe way to El-Maan, and to wait there for yourself and Ali Higg,\nto wait as long as three days if necessary. Say you will join\nthem there and lead the raid. You understand me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You understand that you will die immediately if you disobey?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"He will ask what the shooting meant just now. You will answer\nthat there was a mistake owing to the darkness, and that Ali Higg\nis in a great rage, and he had better make himself scarce. If he\nasks others questions, curse him and tell him to be off.\n\n\"And one last warning, Jael Higg! Obey me exactly, and you shall\nsee your husband in Petra. Disobey by as much as a word or a sign\nand you're dead. Do we understand each other?\"\n\n\"You really mean it? You will go to Petra?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I have seen fools, and men in love, and gamblers, but you are\nthe greatest madman of them all,\" she answered. \"Very well, I\nwill speak to him as you say.\"\n\nGrim mounted his camel and rode to the top of a ridge of sand\nabout twenty yards away, where he halted and sat motionless. If\nhe really looked so much like Ali Higg, as seemed to be the case,\nno one at that distance could have doubted his identity. I hauled\noff two or three paces, so as not to betray the fact that I was\nto be Jael's executioner in a certain contingency, and the long\nsleeve of my cloak concealed the pistol.\n\nAs I am setting down the facts exactly as they happened I may as\nwell record here that I laughed. She thought I laughed at her in\ncold-blooded delight at the prospect of murder, and I think that\ntightened her resolution not to give me the least excuse.\n\nBut I was not feeling in the least cold-blooded. I was laughing\nat myself, who might be forced to shoot a woman after all.\n\nPerhaps Grim gave the job to me because he knew I would not shoot\nher in any case. I don't know. Nor do I myself know now whether I\nwould have shot her; sometimes I think yes, sometimes no. My\nguess is that I would have failed to do it, and that Narayan\nSingh, who was standing by and heard every word that passed,\nwould have wiped my eye, as the saying is.\n\nThen Ibrahim ben Ah came striding into our midst like an old-time\nshepherd with a modern rifle in place of crook, looking neither\nto the right nor the left of him, but fixing his eyes on the man\nhe thought was Ali Higg on the camel beyond us. He seemed\nsurprised when Jael Higg stopped him, and told him to take all\nhis men at once to that oasis, where he was to wait, if\nnecessary, three days.\n\n\"I was told to speak with the Lion himself,\" he objected. _\"Ya\nsit Jael,_* there is wrath for those who disobey him!\" [* O\nlady Jael.]\n\n\"Go, taste his wrath then!\" she retorted. \"There was shooting\nbecause of a mistake in the darkness. Good camels were killed. He\nis more enraged than at the loss of twenty men. He would have it\nthe blame is yours--\"\n\n_\"Mashallah!_ Mine!\"\n\n\"But I persuaded him. He cools his wrath in the moonlight,\ncommuning with Allah. Better go, Ibrahim, before his mood\nchanges again.\"\n\n\"But how came he to be here ahead of us? We left him in\nPetra.  How--\"\n\n\"How old beards love to wag! Fool! Go ask him then! I call these\nmen to witness I have given the order that he told me to give to\nyou. I wash my hands!\"\n\nShe began to make the gesture of washing hands, but thought\nbetter of it, for I might have mistaken that for a signal. Old\nIbrahim ben Ah looked straight into her eyes, read resolution\nthere, and bowed like a courtier to a queen. Then he turned on\nhis heel, strode back to his camel, mounted, and returned to his\nmen without another word to any one. Yet I dare bet that he had\ncounted us, and knew we were all strangers, and dare say his\nthoughts would fill a good long chapter of a book.\n\nGrim continued to sit his camel motionless until the raiders\nunder Ibrahim ben Ah had formed into four long lines and ridden\naway westward, towing enough baggage-animals behind them for a\nweek or two's supplies.\n\n\"One hundred and forty men,\" he announced when they were gone.\n\"The Lion of Petra can't have many left.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\"I Think We've Got the Lion of Petra on the Hip!\"\n\n\n\nGrim is one of those fellows who tell you their principles as\ngrudgingly as they let out facts. He would make the poorest sort\nof propagandist or politician, for he doesn't advertise, and\nhates long arguments. What he knows he knows is so because it\nworks; and he proceeds to put it to work.\n\nNor is he much of a teacher. He takes people as he finds them and\nadapts his plans accordingly. So it is only from observation\nextended over a considerable period in all sorts of circumstances\nthat I can say I believe his first and underlying principle is to\nlook for the positive, concrete usefulness in any one with whom\nhe is associated, whether friend or enemy. And this I have heard\nhim say several times.\n\n\"In secret service you limit yourself if you make plans. The game\nis to listen and watch. Presently the other fellow always tells\nhis plans or else betrays them.\"\n\nAnd he is no such fool as to be caught in the act of listening,\nor to forewarn his enemy by seeming to wish to listen.\n\nHe gave the order to march at once. Some of the men doubled up\nuncomfortably on the riding-camels, because of the three that had\nbeen killed, and the Bishareen fell to me.\n\nI ranged alongside Jael Higg, with Narayan Singh on the other\nside of her. At that we were off, Grim leading, well in advance,\nwith Ali Baba and six men in attendance.\n\nThe moon was a bit behind us by that time, so that I did not have\nmuch chance to observe Jael Higg narrowly until she turned her\nface to speak to me. But she was not long about doing that--say\nfifteen minutes--nine hundred seconds; suppressed curiosity can\nwork up a pretty high pressure in that time.\n\n\"Who is this man who looks like Ali Higg?\" she asked me suddenly,\nand I had a good look at her face; you don't have to answer\nquestions without thinking, just because they are asked by a\nwoman in a friendly tone of voice.\n\nHer nose was Roman and very narrow, and her dark eyes looked\nstraight at you without their pupils converging, which produced a\nsensation of being seen through. She had splendid teeth; and her\nmouth, which was humorous, turning upward at the corners when she\nsmiled, had nevertheless a certain suggestion of stealthy\nstrength--perhaps cruelty. Her chin was firm and practical. So\nwere her freckled hands. I decided that the less I said the better.\n\n\"He is a sheikh,\" said I pretty abruptly.\n\nShe turned that empty information over in her mind for a minute,\nand decided to turn her guns on me. Conversation was not easy,\nfor we were swinging along at a great pace, and my camel was a\nlot smaller than hers.\n\n\"And you are an Indian? How is it that you speak English?\"\n\n\"Many of us speak it. We pass our college examinations in English.\"\n\n\"How do you come to be with that--that sheikh?\" she asked next.\n\n\"It pleases me to follow him. _Inshallah,_ I may help him in case\nof sickness.\"\n\n\"You are a _hakim?\"_\n\nI admitted that, although secretly pitying any poor devil who\nmight pin faith to the claim.\n\n\"Ali Higg--the real one, who is known as the Lion of Petra--believes\nin Indian _hakims,_ like all these Arabs who have no use for\nEuropean doctors. And this big man on my left, who is he?\"\n\n\"My servant.\"\n\n\"An Afghan?\"\n\n\"A Pathan.\"\n\nShe turned that over in her mind, too, for several minutes.\n\n\"And how does Ayisha come to be with you?\" she asked at last.\n\nAt that Narayan Singh broke silence, and although he denied it\nafterward I know that his only motive was to get a little\npreliminary vengeance on Ayisha for the names she had called him.\nHe maintains that he was \"casting a stone, as it were, into a\npond to see which way the ripples went.\"\n\n\"Few women will refuse to follow a Pathan when honored by his\nadmiration,\" he boomed.\n\nI could not see her face then, because she was staring at\nNarayan Singh.\n\n\"Do you realize whose wife you are tampering with?\" she\nasked him.\n\n\"Hah! Where I come from a man must guard his women if he hopes to\nkeep them.\"\n\n\"Where you are going to, such a man as you will find his own life\nhard enough to keep,\" she retorted.\n\n_\"Bismillah!_ I have kept it thus far,\" said Narayan Singh.\n\nShe turned to me again.\n\n\"What does the sheikh of yours call himself?\"\n\n\"Hajji Jimgrim bin Yazid of El-Abdeh.\"\n\n\"Jimgrim. Jimgrim. Where have I heard that name?\"\n\n\"The stars have heard it,\" roared Narayan Singh loud enough for\nthe stars to hear him boast. \"He has taken the Lion of Petra's\nshape. He has taken his name. He has taken his wife. And now he\nwill take his den. _Akbar,_ Jimgrim Ali Higg of Petra!\"\n\nMahommed the poet was riding two or three behind us in the line,\nand heard that. He took the cue and began his song. In a minute\nthe whole line was roaring the refrain, and it broke like volleys\non the night:\n\n   _\"Akbar! Akbar! Jimgrirn Ali Higg!\"_\n\nJael Higg laughed. \"He has a fool's luck and a lusty band of\nfollowers,\" she said. \"It was only because Ayisha called out\nthat he caught me. But a fool's luck is like a breath of wind\nthat passes--\"\n\nSuddenly she sat bolt upright and raised her right hand.\n\n\"Oh, this night! This madness! Of all the dreams, of all the\nhallucinations, this is the wildest! I warned Ali Higg! I told\nhim my foreboding, and he laughed!\"\n\nShe looked down at me again, and studied me for half a minute.\n\n\"Tell me,\" she went on, \"is that Sheikh Jimgrim of yours mad, or\nam I mad?\"\n\n\"If you ask my opinion, as a _hakim,\"_ I answered, \"you were\nmad to sit your camel alone, with only two men, within reach\nof our Jimgrim.\"\n\n\"What does he think he will do with me at Petra?\"\n\n\"He thinks silently,\" said I.\n\nWhereat she too was silent for a few minutes, and then broke out\ninto a new tirade of exclamations, but this time in a language of\nwhich I knew not one word--perhaps Russian, or Slovak, or\nBulgarian. I think she was praying in a sort of wild way to\nlong-neglected saints.\n\nShe gave me the impression of being mentally almost unhinged by\nthe sudden anticlimax of helplessness after over-confidence. Yet\nwhen she spoke again her voice was calm, and not without a ring\nof rather gallant humor.\n\n\"I suppose he thinks he has stolen the queen bee, and so has the\nswarm in his power. But the swarm can sting, and will come for\nthe queen bee.\"\n\n\"So they bring their honey with them, who minds that?\" Narayan\nSingh retorted.\n\nHe was enjoying himself, acting the part of a bandit's follower\nwith perfect gusto.\n\n\"Oh, so it is honey you are after? And you two are Indians--a\nPathan and--\"\n\n\"From Lahore,\" said I.\n\n\"Five thousand pounds would buy your services?\"\n\n\"Five thousand promises would make us laugh,\" said the Sikh.\n\n\"How much will your sheikh ever pay you? In an hour I will show\nyou a _wady_ down which we three can escape. Agree to that and\nyou shall have five thousand each the same hour that we\nreach Petra.\"\n\n_\"Wallahi!_ Doubtless!\" laughed Narayan Singh. \"Five thousand\nbastinados each from Ali Higg, while the queen bee laughs at us\nfor fools! Nay, lady Jael, you are Jimgrim's prisoner.\"\n\n\"Jimgrim!\" she said. \"Somewhere I have heard that name.\"\n\nAnd she turned it over in her mind again like a taster trying\nwine, not speaking again for nearly an hour, until we drew\nabreast of a chaos of irregular great boulders that partly\nconcealed the mouth of a gorge as dark and ugly as the throat\nof Tophet.\n\n\"There is your chance!\" she said. \"Will you take it? You shall\nhave employment with the Lion of Petra! Come!\"\n\nBut neither of us answered, and I kept a bright lookout for a\npistol she still might have concealed on her; for she had not\nbeen searched--there was none who could do that with decency\nexcept Ayisha, who was not to be trusted.\n\nI knew Grim would not halt again before morning because the\ncamels would not feed properly until after daylight, even if you\nput corn in front of them. We were likely in for a forced march\non Petra, and he would not choose to halt twice if it could be\nhelped. And I supposed that when we did halt he would look to\nNarayan Singh and me for information.\n\nYet Mrs. Ali Higg number one was hardly a person you could expect\nto answer questions truthfully; and even until the stars began to\ngrow pale in the east ahead of us I possessed my soul in patience.\n\nThen: \"Is it money your Sheikh Jimgrim wants?\" she asked at last.\n\"Does he hold me to ransom? If so, I will give him a draft on\nthe Bank of Egypt. I have Ali Higg's seal here, and I write\nall his letters.\"\n\nI did not answer, but Narayan Singh checked his camel a stride or\ntwo to make a signal to me behind her back.\n\n\"Hah!\" he remarked with an air of triumph. And I took that to\nmean that in his judgment Jimgrim could find use for Ali\nHigg's seal.\n\nBut of course she heard him, and she took it to mean that she had\nguessed rightly. She turned to Narayan Singh; and because in that\nland, as an almost invariable rule, no business with a chief can\nbe accomplished without bribing his minions, she worked off a\nlittle spite and offered largesse with the same hand.\n\n\"Arrange good terms for me and you shall have Ayisha.\"\n\n\"But I have her,\" said Narayan Singh with a great laugh.\n\n\"Maybe. But you haven't settled yet with Ali Higg. Arrange good\nterms for my ransom, and I will see that Ali Higg wipes off\nAyisha's score.\"\n\n\"We shall see about that; we shall see,\" he answered.\n\n\"Yes, yes! You go and see! Go to him now!\"\n\n\"When we halt,\" the Sikh answered.\n\n\"In an hour it may be too late,\" she insisted. \"If Ali Higg is\nprowling and should swoop down on you who would bargain then?\"\n\nBy that time it was light enough to see clearly at close range,\nand Narayan Singh caught my eye behind her back. I nodded. If\nthere were any likelihood of Ali Higg being on the prowl why\nshould she be in such a hurry to make terms?\n\nRight then Grim called a halt--none too soon for the camels--in a\nsemicircular space protected by a low cliff that might have been\na quarry-face two thousand years ago; what might have been a pit\nwas all filled in by drifted sand. But he had his own mat spread\non the top of the cliff, whence he could keep an eye on the\nsurrounding country, and gave none of the prisoners a chance to\ntalk to him.\n\nNobody helped Jael Higg from her camel, for she jumped down like\nan acrobat and stood staring about her at Ali Baba's gang, and\nbeing stared at as they went about the business of off-loading\nthe complaining beasts. I saw Ayisha get out of the _shibriyah,_\nface around slowly, and meet Jael's eyes.\n\nNeither woman spoke for a minute, or made any sign, but you could\nalmost see the alternating current of scorn and hate that passed\nbetween them. Then Ayisha fell back on insolence and walked past\nJael deliberately, with dark eyes flashing and a thin smile on\nher lips.\n\n\"So you are now a Pathan's light o' love?\" Jael sneered in Arabic.\n\nAt that Ayisha turned again and faced her.\n\n\"Who speaks? She whom the Lion could not trust to go to Hebron?\n_Um Kulsum!\"_*\n\n------------\n* Um Kulsum was a lady in Arabic legend whose immoralities have\nmade her name a byword.\n------------\n\nAyisha passed on with a scornful shoulder movement. Narayan Singh\ngrinned with malicious amusement. And I was just in time to catch\ntwo of the men again attacking my medicine-chest. Instead of\ntrying to open it they were dragging it along the ground, and\nthey were as pleased with themselves as two small dogs caught\nburying a boot.\n\n\"She has given us money!\"\n\n\"Who has?\"\n\n\"The lady Ayisha. We are to bring her this, and she will take\npoison from it and put it in the other woman's food! So Jimgrim\nwill be rid of her, and all will be well!\"\n\nI got Narayan Singh to keep his eye on the chest, and walked up\nto where Grim was going through the form of Moslem prayer, facing\nMecca on his mat on the low hilltop. That was for the benefit of\nthe prisoners, no doubt.\n\nTo save time I got down on my knees beside him and went through\nthe same motions, keeping a bright lookout for interruptions and\ntelling him in low tones all that had taken place, repeating\nconversations word for word as well as I could recall them.\n\nAt last we both squatted, facing each other, and he lighted a\ncigarette; but it was several minutes yet before he answered.\n\n\"Wants to make terms in a hurry, eh? And has the Lion's seal with\nher?\" he said at last.\n\n\"Well, as old Ali Baba keeps repeating, Allah makes all things\neasy! It's a little soon to talk yet, but I think we've got the\nLion of Petra on the hip!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\"There's No Room for the Two of You!\"\n\n\n\nOf course, no committee in the world ever yet did more than cloud\nan issue with argument. It takes one man to lead the way through\nany set of circumstances, and the only wise course for a\ncommittee is to make that man's decision unanimous and back\nit loyally. But men have their rights, as Grim is always the\nfirst to admit.\n\nAli Baba came and joined us on the cliff-top, and Narayan Singh\nwas not long following suit. The Sikh said nothing, but Ali Baba\nwas conscious of the weight that years should give to his\nopinion, as well as justly proud of his night's work, and not\nat all disposed to sit in silence.\n\n\"Now the right course, Jimgrim, is to make a great circuit and\ncarry these two women back across the British border,\" he began\nat once. \"The Lion of Petra will then pay us all large sums of\nmoney, without which you will refuse to intercede with the\ngovernment on his behalf for their return. Thus every one will be\nsatisfied except the Lion, who will be too poor for a long time\nafterward to have much authority in these parts. Moreover, it\nwill be told for a joke against him, and he will lose in\nprestige. I am an old man, who knows all about these matters.\"\n\n\"What do you think, Narayan Singh?\" Grim asked.\n\n\"Sahib, what are we but a flying column? Swiftness and surprise\nare our two advantages. We should be like a javelin thrown from\nambush that seeks out the enemy's heart. If we fail we are but a\nlost javelin--an officer, a sepoy, a civilian and a handful of\nthieves--there are plenty more! If we succeed there is a deed\ndone well and cheaply! I never hunted lions, but I have seen a\ntiger trapped and beaten. Have we not good bait with us?\"\n\nThere followed a hot argument between Arab and Sikh, each\naccusing the other of ulterior motives as well as ignorance and\ncowardice; in fact, they acted like any other committee, growing\nless and less parliamentary as their views diverged. Ali Baba\nseemed to consider it relevant to call Narayan Singh a drunkard,\nand the Sikh considered it his duty in the circumstances to refer\nto Ali Baba's jail record. In the midst of all that effort to\nsolve the problem at Petra, Grim asked me to go and invite Jael\nHigg to join us.\n\nIn that hard, uncharitable desert daylight she did not impress me\nvery favorably. The lines of her freckled face suggested too much\nruthlessness, as though she was positively handsome in a certain\nway--as long as you observed the whole effect and did not study\ndetails--there was a look of cold experience about her brown eyes\nthat chilled you. Of course, she was tired and that made a\ndifference; but I did not find it easy to feel sympathetic, and I\nthought she was hardly the woman to win a jury's verdict on the\nstrength of personal appeal.\n\nNevertheless, with all the odds against her, she accomplished\nthat morning what I had never done, or seen done, although many\nhave attempted it and failed. She contrived to tear away Grim's\nmask and to expose the man's real feelings.\n\nHe was always an enigma to me until that interview, at which they\nsquatted facing each other on Grim's mat, with me beside Grim and\nthe Sikh and Ali Baba glaring daggers at each other on either\nhand. The early sun seemed to edge everybody with a sort of aura,\nbut it also showed every detail of a face and made it next to\nimpossible to hide emotion.\n\nShe opened the ball. I imagine she had been doing that most of\nher life.\n\n\"Jimgrim,\" she said. \"Jimgrim. Are you by any chance the American\nnamed James Grim, who fought with Lawrence in Allenby's campaign?\"\n\nGrim astonished us all by admitting it at once. The name Jimgrim\nsounds enough like Arabic to pass muster; and we wondered why he\nshould have gone to all that trouble to disguise himself, only to\nconfess his real name when there seemed no need. Even Ali Baba\nleft off cursing the Sikh under his breath.\n\n\"I am glad to know that,\" she said. \"It will save my wasting\nwords. No man could ever get your reputation without being\nruthless. I won't annoy you by pleading for mercy.\"\n\nAnd she looked at once as merciless as she expected him to be.\n\n\"Now, Jael Higg,\" he answered, \"let's talk sense.\"\n\n\"You're a rare one, if you can!\" she retorted.\n\n\"Let's do our best,\" he said kindly.\n\nShe looked very keenly at him for thirty seconds, and seemed to\nmake up her mind that she had no chance against him.\n\n\"Very well,\" she said. \"I'll begin by being sensible. How much\nmoney do you want?\"\n\nIt is true that the more you analyze Grim's face the more he does\nimpress you as a keen business man. But there are modifying\nsymptoms. He did not appear to have heard the question.\n\n\"I want you to be straightforward and tell me all you know of Ali\nHigg's circumstances.\"\n\n\"Yes. I'd expect you to want that. As an American hired by the\nBritish to help them exploit this country, that's what you would\nask. After you know all about him you can fix the ransom. That\nright? Well, I won't tell.\"\n\n\"I hoped we were going to talk sense,\" he answered quietly.\n\n\"How can any one talk sense with a man like you? What are you\ndoing in this country? `Horning in' is what they'd call it in\nAmerica. You've got no business here. It's different in my case.\nI'm married to Ali Higg. I've thrown in my lot with these people.\nI've a right to help them to independence. But what right have\nyou got to interfere? Bah! Name your price. I'll pay if I can.\"\n\n\"Well, Jael,\" he answered with a rather whimsical smile. \"I'll\ntry to disillusion you to begin with. Perhaps if you understand\nme better you'll be reasonable.\n\n\"All I know is Arabic and Arabs. I've no other gifts, and I like\nto be some use in the world. I'm real fond of Arabs. It 'ud\ntickle me to see them make good. But I can see as far through a\nstone wall as any blind horse can, and I know--better maybe than\nyou do, Jael--that all they'll get by cutting loose and playing\npirates is the worst end of it. I hate to see them lose out, so I\nuse what gifts I've got in their behalf.\"\n\n\"Do you call it helping us to come out against Ali Higg and\nkidnap his wives?\" she retorted. \"Ali Higg is a patriot. He's\nagainst all foreign control of Arab country, and he's man enough\nto fight.\n\n\"These British and French and Italians promised us an independent\nArab country. Where is it? Have you seen any of it? No. And\nyou're helping the British break their promise!\n\n\"Ali Higg is doing his best to redeem what Arabs fought for in\nthe war, and I'm his wife. You ask me to betray him? Never!\"\n\n\"Ali Higg is doing his worst, not his best, Jael.\"\n\n\"He is creating unity among these tribes,\" she retorted.\n\n\"He is practically forcing the British to come out and smash\nhim,\" said Grim. \"Now, see here, Jael, I don't want him smashed.\nI don't hold with his method, but that's the Arab's business; if\nbeing crucified and shot for differences of opinion suits them,\nwhy, no doubt Ali Higg's the right man for them. They tell me he\ndelivers the goods. But he can't go starting a new war out here,\nnot while I've any say he can't.\"\n\n\"Who are you that should say or not say?\" she demanded.\n\n\"Same as Ali Higg, Jael; I'm a human. He's from Arabia, you're\nfrom the Balkans, I'm from the U.S. We're all three foreigners,\naren't we?\"\n\n\"Yes. But he and I are foreigners who will drive the British out--\"\n\n\"And let French or Italians in.\"\n\n\"Ali Higg is a fighter, I tell you! He's an Arab, and he knows\nhow to control Arabs just as the Prophet Mohammed did. He has\nonly begun in a small way, but--\"\n\n\"But he'll wind up like a small-town sport in the lock-up, the\nway he's going,\" said Grim. \"Now, see here, Jael, I'm just as set\non doing my bit in the world as Ali Higg is. Maybe I'm a mite\nmore tolerant, but there isn't a man or woman living who can\nshift me off a course once I'm set on it.\n\n\"Ali Higg considers the Arabs need a holy war. I'm hell bent for\npeace. I'm going to stop him. I'm not arguing that point, for it\nwon't bear arguing, and I'm not trying to convert you. But you're\nin my power, and though I sure would hate to inconvenience a\nlady, I'm that plumb remorseless I'd separate you from Ali Higg\nfor ever unless you helped me call him off the warpath.\"\n\n\"Help you!\" she exclaimed with horror.\n\n\"Sure. You've got to! There's no law this side of the border,\nJael, that can make me hand you over to authority. There's no\nmandate out here yet. There never will be one if I can prevent\nit. I'm here to keep a foreign army from trespassing across the\nJordan, it being my crazy notion that Arabs can evolve their own\ngovernment, if let. You've got to help me keep that foreign army\nout, or take the consequences.\"\n\nShe laughed at last. It was rather a hard laugh without much\nmirth in it.\n\n\"Your words are a liar's, but your voice rings true,\" she said.\n\"I think you're only another of these diplomatists.\"\n\n\"I'm that diplomatic I'm chancing my hide to save other peoples,\"\nhe answered. \"Let's be quite frank, Jael. I'm in danger out here.\nAll I've got with me besides two respectable men are thieves from\nEl-Kalil. That little army of Ali Higg's lies between me and the\nborder, and I'm no kind of a darn-fool optimist when it comes to\nfiguring on Ali Higg's hospitality in Petra. Nor am I kidding\nmyself I can persuade His Dibs by a theological argument or any\ncheap advice.\n\n\"But I've reasoned it out this way--if Ali Higg sends Ayisha to\nEl-Kalil rather than trust you to do your shopping, that's\nbecause he sets a value on you. Since he sends you out in charge\nof a raid on El-Maan I guess he sets a high value on you. That's\nas good as saying you've got influence. Believe me, Jael,\nyou'll use that influence to suit my plans or we're not going\nto be friends!\"\n\n\"Friends?\" she said, and stared at him.\n\n\"Sure. Why not? Look at the men I've got with me; they're all my\nfriends. I'm right proud to say it. I might have hanged most of\nthem once, but I never knew it do much good to a man to hang him;\nso we get acquainted, and one way and another we contrive to keep\non good terms.\n\n\"See my point? Nobody'd hang you if I scooted back over the\nborder with you, Jael. There isn't a law that would cover your\ncase. But they'd deport you, and you'd be an outcast with tabs\nkept on you, and I've seen your sort come to a bad end. I never\nliked to see it. I never saw anybody gain by it. I'd sooner see\nyou winning every one's respect by sticking to Ali Higg and\nschooling him to play safe.\"\n\nHer pale face actually blushed under the freckles. She had not\nlived in America for nothing. As the wife of a polygamist she\nknew exactly what he meant about winning respect. Her sort enjoys\nto be patronized by reformers and social uplifters about as much\nas an eagle likes a cage.\n\n\"You talk well,\" she said, \"but you must be a fool at bottom, or\nyou wouldn't suggest friendship with me. Can you imagine me not\npushing you into Ali Higg's clutches at the first chance?\"\n\n\"Sure I can, or I wouldn't waste time talking. You've got more\nsense than that, Jael. You might trick me. It has been done. Ali\nHigg might scupper me and the crowd--he mighty likely would. But\nthat 'ud be the end of Ali Higg's prospects, for as sure as my\nname's Grim the British would smash him to avenge me, and you\nknow it! If they didn't get you they'd get him, and you'd become\nthe property of the first petty chief who could lay his hands on\nyou. So let's talk like two sensible people.\"\n\n\"You'll find me sensible,\" she answered. \"I shall just do\nnothing--tell you nothing.\"\n\n\"You've told too much already to be able to stop now, Jael,\" he\nanswered, smiling. \"I'm sure you won't put me to the necessity of\nsearching you; you've too much pride for that. So suppose you\npass me Ali Higg's seal--the one you sign all his letters with.\nNo, don't try to hide it in the sand; put it here.\"\n\nHe held his hand out, and she bit her lip in mortification. It\nwas too bad that she had made that slip of boasting to Narayan\nSingh and me about the seal, but there was nothing else for it\nnow and she gave it to him--a gold thing as big as a silver\nhalf-dollar, marvelously engraved.\n\n\"That settles the financial end of it,\" said Grim. \"We can\nimpound all that money in the Bank of Egypt--although I'm free to\nadmit I wouldn't take such a seal away from a friend of mine.\"\n\n\"Give it back, then,\" she answered with a bitter little laugh. \"I\nsee I'll have to be your friend.\"\n\nHe smiled--wonderfully gently. There wasn't the least offense in\nit, although there wasn't any credulity either.\n\n\"I always aim to prove myself a man's friend--or a woman's,\" he\nsaid, \"before expecting to be trusted out of sight. I dare say\nthat's your code too?\"\n\n\"If ever Ali Higg catches you with that seal--\"\n\n\"He won't catch me, Jael; he won't catch me. But you shall have\nit back, and the money shan't be touched, if you play straight.\"\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders petulantly, admitting defeat but\nresenting it. There came a time, months later, when she understood\nGrim's peculiar altruism and respected it, but she was a long\nway just then from admiring him.\n\n\"You force me,\" she said. \"Name your terms.\"\n\n\"Well, then, suppose we speak of Ali Higg to begin with. Is his\ntemper uneven? Is there any way to catch him in a specially\ngood humor?\"\n\n\"He's the most even-tempered man I know,\" she laughed. \"He's\nalways in a rage.\"\n\n\"So much the easier for us,\" Grim answered. \"That kind always\nmake mistakes. He must have counted on your brains exclusively to\nkeep him on top; and now your brains are in my pocket, so to\nspeak. How's his health? Boils? Indigestion?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"Ah! Most angry men have indigestion. Dislikes European doctors,\nI dare say? Thought so; most fanatical Moslems do that. But an\nIndian _hakim?_ Now, many an Indian _hakim_ knows how to relieve\nindigestion--in between the bouts of rage. D'you suppose he'd\nentertain a _hakim?\"_\n\nShe nodded again.\n\n\"Well, we'll fix it so a _hakim_ can relieve his boils and\nindigestion. But let you and me understand each other first,\nJael. I can be a mean man when I must, but I'll always take a\nheap of trouble to find a white man's way of accomplishing the\nsame purpose. I can act mean toward you--sheer plug-ugly if you\nforce my hand--but I'd sooner not; and I'd just as lief help\nyou as hinder you, provided you don't upset what I'm seeking\nto build.\"\n\nShe laughed again, and not so bitterly.\n\n\"You're on the wrong side of the wall to build much,\" she\nanswered. \"You should come over into our camp. You're so like Ali\nHigg in certain lights and in some of your gestures, and so\nunlike him in other things, that if you came across the Jordan\nfor good I think you could show us something.\"\n\nHer eyes said far more than her lips did. She was studying him\nfrom a new angle--a thoughtful, speculative angle that vaguely\nexcited her.\n\n\"What I mean is just this,\" he said; \"that you and I had better\ndecide to be real friends, and not half-open enemies, each\nlooking for a chance to spoil the other's game. There are men in\nthis camp who'll tell you that I keep my word. I'm willing to\npledge it not to hurt you or Ali Higg, provided you pledge yours\nto be equally friendly and to help me in taming Ali Higg so's\nhe'll be useful and not just an ordinary trouble-maker.\"\n\n\"Would you accept my word?\" she asked him--ready to consider him\nfool or liar, according to how he answered.\n\n\"I'll accept it, Jael. Sure. For you'll have to give it, and it's\nall you've got to trade with. And I'll watch you just about\ntwice as carefully as examiners watch the bank directors of\nNew York State.\n\n\"Knowing you're watched, like them you're going to be too proud\nto cheat; and after you've found how it pays to play straight\nwith me you're going almost to enjoy being watched for the sake\nof the advertisement.\"\n\nHer face did not soften in the least; but it changed expression,\nlike a woman buyer's who has decided to make a purchase but has\nnot done bargaining.\n\n\"I think I'm going to like you,\" she said. \"Of course, you're a\nliar, like all men, but you've a finer touch than most.\"\n\nAt that point Ali Baba made his first contribution to the\nargument. The old man did not know much English, but there are\ncertain words--such as liar, cheat, swine, thief, and the list of\noaths--that find their way like water to the common level and are\nknown from Spitzbergen to the Horn.\n\n\"He is no liar!\" he exclaimed in Arabic. \"A cunning man with the\nbrain of three, who can use the truth for his own ends! A keeper\nof secrets! An upsetter of plans! But he is no liar, and I will\nnot hear him called one by a woman! Peace, thou fool! It is\nwritten that a woman's tongue is worse than water dripping\nthrough a roof!\"\n\nIt is manners in that country to sit silent while an old man\nspeaks, and even Jael Higg did not offer to rebuke him for the\ninterruption. When he had quite finished Grim took up the\nargument again.\n\n\"Now let's know where we stand. Are you and I to be friends, Jael?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"I'm no half-way adventurer. I'll make your fortune,\" she said,\n\"if you'll come the whole way with me, and stay this side\nof Jordan.\"\n\nHe shook his head and smiled back at her.\n\n\"You've your work cut out to keep Ali Higg off the rocks, Jael.\"\n\n\"There's no room for two of you,\" she answered darkly.\n\n\"I guess not.\"\n\nShe looked hard at me, and back from me to Grim. I don't know\nyet whether she was setting a trap for us or really in earnest\nabout what she said next. Grim thinks she was drawing a bow\nat a venture.\n\n\"Is this the _hakim?_ One of the two respectable persons you have\nwith you? Hm! Respectability is a mask--often a safe mask, often\nan offensive one, always a lie. All really dangerous criminals\nare respectable people.\n\n\"And a _hakim,_ eh? An Indian physician? I have heard of Indian\nphysicians being poisoners--although, of course, they're\nrespectable people and give the poison by mistake! Now if he\nshould go to Ali Higg and poison him, while pretending to cure\nboils and indigestion--\"\n\n\"But he won't,\" said Grim, \"so why suppose?\"\n\n\"Of course he won't, unless you tell him to!\" she snapped.\n\n\"I dare say he's as much in your power as I am. But suppose you\ntell him to--\"\n\n\"I won't, Jael.\"\n\n\"Now don't you be a fool, James Grim! You can't deceive me into\nthinking you're above such things. That haughty attitude is\nBritish, not American; you've been defiled by contact with\nthem.  Come out into the open like an unhypocritical American.\nTalk business.\n\n\"I've tried to make a man of Ali Higg, but he's only an animal\nafter all. The best I can ever do with him will be failure\ncompared to what I could make of you, James Grim. You look enough\nlike him to make it possible to substitute you with care. Go\nahead and send your _hakim.\"_\n\nGrim smiled with perfect good humor, but a blind man could not\nhave mistaken his refusal.\n\n\"Oh, you're all hypocrites, you men--Americans, English,\nFrench--you're all alike; glad to see a man die, if he's a\nnuisance, but afraid to admit you'd a hand in it. But you needn't\nfear. You can send your _hakim_ uninstructed. He's an Indian,\nisn't he? Well, Ali Higg is sure to insult him to the very marrow\nof his bones, and you can safely leave Indian revengefulness to\ndo the rest.\"\n\nGrim shook his head.\n\n\"He'd be too afraid he might meet me some day. He knows I'd not\nstand for it. No, Jael; I invited you to talk sense. You've got\nto make shift with Ali Higg `as is'. If you don't like it say so\nnow and I'll tell off three or four of my thieves to escort you\nover the border into British territory while I play this game\nwithout you.\n\n\"What you've got to understand first and last is that I'm dead\nset on clipping Ali Higg's claws. I don't care a row of imitation\npewter shucks about any man's ambition, or any woman's past. My\njob in the world is to do what I'm able to do, and I'm going to\nprevent war in this land if I get killed doing it and have to\nruin you in the bargain! Now, are we set?\"\n\n\"I think you're a fool,\" she said, \"and you think me a villain.\nWe're strange partners! Very well, let's try.\"\n\nPromptly he handed her an envelop, sheet of paper, and his\nfountain-pen.\n\n\"Write first, then, to Ibrahim ben Ah. He knows your hand, I\nsuppose? Tell him there is news of a British force coming over\nthe border, and that he must stay at that oasis in readiness to\nattack after Ali Higg has taken steps to draw the British in the\nright direction.\n\n\"Say he may have to stay there a week or ten days, and that\nhe is to enforce the death penalty on any of his men who dares\ntry to leave the oasis. Tell him that secrecy as to his present\nwhereabouts is the all-important point. For that reason strangers\nmay be made prisoner and held until further orders. The messenger\nwho bears this is to be sent back with an answer immediately.\"\n\n\"How much of that is true about a British force?\" she demanded.\n\"Are you trying to trap those men?\"\n\n\"None of it's true. No, they're safe. You write, and I'll sign it\nwith your seal.\"\n\nShe hesitated, but I don't know whether from caution or from a\ngenuine dislike to deceive her husband's loyal henchman. But\nthere was no way of getting out of it except by blunt refusal,\ninvolving the threatened escort into British territory and\ndeportation. So she wrote, and Grim sealed the letter: He handed\nit to Ali Baba.\n\n\"Select the most trustworthy of your sons, O King of Thieves,\ngive him the fastest camel, and let him ride with that to the\noasis. Bid him ride hard and overtake us with the answer.\"\n\n\"Do you think my sons have wings?\" asked Ali Baba.\n\n\"Not unless devils are winged!\" laughed Grim. \"It is a simple\nmatter--just there and back again.\"\n\n\"Not so simple, Jimgrim! It is written that in the desert all men\nare enemies. What if he should meet a dozen men?\"\n\n\"The letter will be his pass. He must take a chance returning.\"\n\n_\"Wallahi!_ A letter? A pass into Jehannum possibly! By Allah,\nJimgrim, a man needs more than a letter in these parts. He needs\nbrains--age--influence--experience. Nay! If any is to take that\nletter, let me do it. I am old, and they hesitate to kill an old\nman. I am wise in the desert ways, not rash. And if they do kill\nme, then it is only an old man's body bloating in the sun.\n\n\"Besides, I am cunning and can give wise answers, whereas those\nsons of mine might take offense at an insult, or recognize a\nblood enemy at the wrong moment. Nay, it is I who must take\nthat letter.\"\n\nGrim clapped him on the back.\n\n\"Good, my father; you shall go. Take one son with you to look\nafter your comforts.\"\n\nHe turned that suggestion over in his mind for several minutes,\nbut shook his head finally.\n\n\"I go alone. They would ask me why two men bring one letter.\nMoreover, they might send the one back with an answer, retaining\nthe other as hostage; for it is the way of the devil to put\nsuspicion in men's minds. Two men would double their doubt, just\nas two stones weigh the twice of one. And I will not take the\nbest camel, but the worst one.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Write me a second letter. Have the woman write it, and you affix\nthe seal. Give order that they are to provide a swift, fresh\ncamel in exchange for my weary beast. I shall make a great fuss\nabout the beast they provide, rejecting this and that one, thus\ncausing them to believe in me, since men without proper authority\ndo not act thus, but are content with anything so be they can\nonly escape unharmed.\"\n\nSo the second letter was written; and in the rising, scorching\nheat old Ali Baba set off, mounted on the meanest of the baggage\nbeasts, whose hump was getting galled, so that he wasn't likely\nto be of much use to us within a day or so.\n\nThen we all got under the shelter of the low tents to give the\nother camels a rest and wait for evening, and I think Jael Higg\nslept, but I don't know, for we gave her a tent to herself; she\nrefused point blank to share one with Ayisha.\n\nAnd Ayisha, I know, did not sleep. She came in the noon glare to\nthe tent I occupied with Narayan Singh and entered without\nceremony, slipping through the low opening with the silent ease\nthat comes naturally to the Badawi. She squatted down in front of\nus, and I awoke the Sikh, who was snoring a chorus from Wagner's\n\"Niebelungen Ring.\"\n\nFor a moment I thought he was going to resume the night's\nflirtation, but there was something in the quiet manner of her\nand the serious expression of her face that he recognized as\nquickly as I did. All her imperious attitude was gone. She did\nnot look exactly pleading, nor yet cunning; perhaps it was a\nblend of both that gave her the soft charm she had come\ndeliberately armed with.\n\nOf this one thing I am absolutely sure; whatever that young woman\ndid was calculated and deliberate; and the more she seemed to act\non impulse the more she had really studied out her move.\n\nNarayan Singh checked a word half-way, and we waited for her to\nspeak first. Her eyes sought mine, and then the medicine-chest.\nThen she looked back at me, and I made a gesture inviting her\nto speak.\n\n\"You told me,\" she said at last, \"that you have poison in that\nbox that would reach down to hell and slay the ifrits. Give me\nsome of it.\"\n\n_\"Ya sit Ayisha._ I need it all for the ifrits,\" I answered.\n\n\"I will make no trouble for you,\" she said; and for a moment I\nsuspected she meant to kill herself.\n\n\"You are young and beautiful,\" I told her. \"The world holds\nplenty of good for you yet.\"\n\nAt that she flashed her white teeth and her eyes blazed.\n\n\"Truly! Allah puts a good omen into your mouth, _miyan!_* Yet\nlittle comes to the woman who neglects to plan for it. Give me\nthe poison. I will pay.\"\n\n-------------\n* _Miyan:_ the rather contemptuous form of address that Arabs use\ntoward Indian Moslems.\n-------------\n\nI was about to refuse abruptly, being rather old-maidish about\nsome things and not always ready with a smile for what I don't\napprove; but Narayan Singh interrupted in time to prevent the\nunforgivable offense of preaching my own code of morals uninvited.\n\n\"Tell us who is to be poisoned,\" he demanded.\n\n\"That is none of your business,\" she answered calmly.\n\n\"But the poison is our business,\" said the Sikh. \"We make terms.\nIf the person to be poisoned is an enemy of ours, well and good;\nyou shall have it and we shall be gainers. But Allah forbid that\nwe should hasten the death of a friend! Is it for Jael Higg?\"\n\n\"No, for I see that to poison her would be to incur the enmity of\nJimgrim. Already he takes counsel with her; did he and she not\nlay their heads together in your presence after morning prayers?\"\n\n\"For whom, then? For Jimgrim?\"\n\n\"God forbid! Shall I woo a dead man? Nay! You say you will give\nme the poison if I tell? You swear it? Then it is for the Lion of\nPetra. Thus I shall win the love of Jimgrim. And Jael, being\nwithout a man, will run away to Egypt, where her money is.\"\n\n_\"Bismillah!\"_ swore the Sikh. \"I see no reason why I should not\nget an angry husband out of the way so simply! But remember,\nAyisha, you must slay me in turn if you hope to have Jimgrim for\nhusband. By my beard and the Prophet's feet* it is I who will\nhave you to wife, if I have to burn kingdoms first!\"\n\n----------\n* A scandalous piece of blasphemy\n----------\n\n\"Give me the poison first, and we shall see,\" she laughed.\n\n\"Very well; leave us for a while, Ayisha. I will persuade this\nmaster of mine, who has a vein of caution, since he lacks the\nzeal of love. I will bring you the stuff when he and I have\ntalked it over.\"\n\n\"Strong, strong stuff,\" she insisted. \"Stuff that would eat iron.\nAli Higg's belly is tough.\"\n\n\"It shall come out through his flesh like flame,\" the Sikh promised.\n\nAs soon as she had gone, and he had watched her out of earshot,\nhe turned to me with a gruff laugh.\n\n\"Now, sahib, make her up a potion of some harmless powder for me\nto carry to her tent while you go and tell our Jimgrim what has\npassed. Give her physic that will purge the Lion of Petra without\ndoing worse than make his belly burn. Stay; give croton in a\nbottle; that is best.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\"That We Make a Profit from this Venture!\"\n\n\n\nLate that afternoon, before they loaded up the camels, there was\nanother conference between Grim, Jael Higg, Narayan Singh, our\nprisoner Yussuf, and myself. The ancient hills of Edom were not\nfar away, and we were near enough to Petra to feel nervous. Jael\nmade a pretty good pretense of meeting Grim half-way, and I think\nshe had made up her mind to let him dig his own pit and tumble\ninto it.\n\nYussuf was aware by that time, if not of Grim's identity, at any\nrate of the fact that he was an officer in the British pay, and\nwas rather obviously considering which would likely pay him\nbest--to side secretly with Ali Higg or openly with Grim, or both.\n\nHaving fought over all that country under Lawrence, and knowing\nconsequently every yard of it, I suppose Grim felt neither\nthrilled nor mystified; but in case any scientist reads this and\nwants to know how I felt, \"fed up and far from home\" about\ndescribes it. But there was worse to come!\n\nGrim turned to me at last and smiled in that darned genial\nway he has when he means to call on your uttermost patience\nor endurance.\n\n\"You see, the difficulty is,\" he said, \"to get to Ali Higg\nwithout his getting us first. He has probably got between forty\nand fifty men in Petra with him, so we daren't invade the place.\nYet we've got to hurry, because old Ibrahim ben Ah with that army\nmay get suspicious and send back a messenger on his own account.\nNow, do you feel willing to beard the Lion in his den?\"\n\n\"Alone?\" I asked.\n\nI never felt less willing to do anything, and dare say my face\nbetrayed it.\n\n\"No. Narayan Singh will go too, and, of course, Ayisha.\"\n\nAyisha seemed about as safe an ambassador to send as an electric\nspark to a barrel of powder. I glanced at Narayan Singh and felt\nashamed, for his eyes glowed unmistakably. He was enthusiastic.\n\nWell, it seems I draw a color-line after all. I can't fight like\na Sikh, or be as good a man in lots of ways; but I'm not going to\nbe outdone by one in daring, while the Sikh is looking.\n\n\"All right,\" I said, \"I'll do anything you say.\"\n\nBut I did not have the perfect voice-control I would have liked,\nand Jael Higg grinned. That naturally settled it.\n\n\"Narayan Singh needn't come if he'd rather stay with you,\" I\nadded, and the Sikh raised his eyebrows.\n\n\"Do you dare to make love to Ayisha, sahib?\" he grinned.\n\nI began to see the general drift of the plan of campaign, and\nwondered. Having seen more than a little of the Near East, and\nknowing how the peace of the whole world depends on preserving\nthat unmelted hotpot of nations from anarchy, I was not impressed\nby the stability of things in general!\n\nGrim had come out on his hair-raising venture because no army was\navailable to deal with Ali Higg, and he would not have ventured\nunless powers-that-pretend-to-be were sure that Ali Higg was\ndeadly dangerous. Did the peace of the world, then, depend on the\nsuccess or otherwise of a Sikh's mock love-making. It did look\nlike it.\n\nNarayan Singh got to his feet with a laugh and a yawn, and went\nto dance attendance on Ayisha, while Grim reinstructed Yussuf\nregarding the ease with which the British could impound his Jaffa\nproperty; but though I listened to all that, and heard Yussuf's\nvows of fidelity--heard him promise to reverse his former report\nand spread rumors in Ali's camp of a British army getting ready\nto advance--the prospect to me looked gloomier and gloomier.\n\n\"You can only die once,\" Grim laughed after a quick glance at my\nface, \"and we may save a hundred thousand people from the sword.\"\n\nBut I suppose I wasn't cut out to be a willing martyr. It was a\ncase of making a silk purse out of a sow's ear, and though\nI did go forward on that mad escapade it was fear that drove\nme--fear of the Sikh's and Grim's contempt, and of my own\nself-loathing afterward.\n\nGrim and Narayan Singh are made of the real hero stuff. I wonder\nhow many others there are like me, who face the music simply\nbecause one or two others have got guts enough to lead us\nup to it.\n\nWe didn't move far that night, for there was no need, and Grim\nwas careful not to go where Ali Baba could not find him. We\npassed through acres of oleander-scrub into a valley twelve miles\nwide at its mouth, that narrowed gradually until the high red\nsandstone cliffs shut out the moonlight. It was like the mouth of\nhell, and suffocating, for the cliff-sides were giving off the\nheat they had sucked up through the day.\n\nThe surest sign that Ali Higg was either over-confident or\nseriously engaged elsewhere was that there was no guard in the\nravine. Ten men properly placed could have destroyed us. Even the\ngreat Alexander of Macedon could not force that gorge, and\nsuffered one of his worst defeats there. The Turks made the same\nmistake and tried to oust Lawrence in the Great War; but he\nsimply overwhelmed them with a scratch brigade of partly armed\nBedouins and women.\n\nGrim called a halt at last where a dozen caves a hundred feet\nabove the bottom of the gorge could be reached by a goat-track\nleading to a ledge. There was a rift in the side-wall there,\nmaking a pitch-dark corner where the camels could lie unseen and\ngrumble to one another--safe enough until daylight, unless they\nshould see ghosts and try to stampede for the open. Grim sent the\nwomen and Ayisha's four men up to the caves with only Narayan\nSingh to watch them, for there was no way of escape, except by\nthat twelve-inch goat-track.\n\nThen, because Ali Baba's sons and grandsons were nervous about\nthe \"old man their father,\" and because the one thing that more\nthan all other circumstances combined could ruin our slim chance\nwould be panic, Grim squatted on the sand in the gorge with the\nmen all around him and began to tell stories.\n\nRight there in the very jaws of death, within a mile of the lair\nof Ali Higg, in possession of two of the tyrant's wives, with an\narmy at our rear that might at that minute be following old Ali\nBaba into the gorge to cut off our one possible retreat, he told\nthem the old tales that Arabs love, and soothed them as if they\nwere children.\n\nThat was the finest glimpse of Grim's real manhood I had\nexperienced yet, although I could not see him for the darkness.\nYou couldn't see any one. It was a voice in the night--strong,\nreassuring--telling to born thieves stories of the warm humanity\nof other thieves, whose accomplishments in the way of cool cheek\nand lawless altruism were hardly more outrageous than the task in\nfront of us.\n\nAnd he told them so well that even when a chill draft crept along\nthe bottom of the gorge two hours before dawn, taking the place\nof the hot air that had ascended, and you could feel the shiver\nthat shook the circle of listeners, they only drew closer and\nleaned forward more intently--almost as if he were a fire at\nwhich they warmed themselves.\n\nBut heavens! It seemed madness, nevertheless. We had no more\npickets out than the enemy had. We were relying utterly on Grim's\ninformation that he had extracted from the women and the\nprisoners, and on his judgment based on that.\n\nNo doubt he knew a lot that he had not told us, for that is his\ninfernal way of doing business; but neither that probability, nor\nhis tales that so suited the Arab mind, nor the recollection of\nearlier predicaments in which his flair for solutions had been\ninfallibly right, soothed my nerves much; and I nearly jumped out\nof my skin when a series of grunts and stumbling footfalls broke\nthe stillness of the gorge behind us.\n\nIt sounded like ten weary camels being cursed by ten angry men,\nand I supposed at once that Ibrahim ben Ah had sent a detachment\nto investigate and that this was their advance-guard. Who else\nwould dare to lift his voice in that way in the gorge? You could\nhear the words presently:\n\n\"Ill-bred Somali beast! Born among vermin in a black man's kraal!\nAllah give thee to the crows! Weary? What of it? What of my back,\nthou awkward earthquake! Thou plow-beast! A devil sit on thee! A\ndevil drive thee! A devil eat thee!\"\n\n_Whack! Whack!_\n\n\"Oh my bones! My old bones!\"\n\nMujrim was the first to recognize the voice. He got up quietly\nand stood in the gorge; and in another minute a blot of denser\nblackness that was a camel loomed above him, and he raised his\nhand to seize the head-rope. But the camel saw him first, and,\nrealizing that the journey was over at last, flung itself to the\nground with the abandon of a foundered dog, and lay with its neck\nstretched out straight and legs all straddled anyhow. Mujrim was\njust in time to catch his father, who was nearly as tired as the\ncamel. It was pretty obvious at once that Jael's authority had\nfailed badly when it came to exchanging camels.\n\nThe sons all surrounded the old man and made a fuss over him,\nlaying him down on a sheepskin coat and chafing his stiff\nmuscles, calling him brave names, rubbing his feet, patting his\nhands, praising him, while he swore at them each time they\ntouched a sore spot.\n\nThey would not even give him a chance to hand over his letter\nto Grim, until at last he swore so savagely that Mujrim paid\nattention and took the letter out of the old man's waistcloth. It\nwas in the same envelop in which the other had gone, unsealed,\nbut with the thumb-mark of Ibrahim ben Ah imprinted on its face.\n\n\"To think that I, of all people, should fetch and carry for such\ndogs!\" swore Ali Baba. \"I asked for a good beast in exchange for\nmine, and they gave me this crow's meat, and laughed! May Allah\nchange their faces! May the water of that oasis turn their bowels\ninto stone!\n\n\"Aye, Jimgrim, they will stay there! They are glad enough to stay\nthere. They are dogs that fear their master's whip. They are so\nafraid of him that I think if Ali Higg should bid them roast\nthemselves alive the dogs would do it. May they roast a second\ntime in hell for giving me that camel.\n\n\"Bah! What kind of sons have I? Are these the sons of my loins\nthat let me parch? Is there no water-bag?\"\n\nGrim struck a match in the dark corner where the camels were; but\nall the envelop contained was a piece of jagged paper torn from\nthe original letter, with Ibrahim ben Ah's thumb-mark done\nin ink made from gunpowder by way of acknowledgment. It meant,\npresumably, that instructions would be obeyed, and so far, good;\nwe were not now in danger of trouble from that source.\n\nBut Ali Baba found his tongue again, and freed himself from his\nsons after he had drank about a quart of water.\n\n\"That Ibrahim ben Ah was puzzled,\" he said. \"Allah! But the fool\nasked questions; and by the Prophet's beard I lied in answer to\nhim! Ho! What a string of lies! Who was I but a sheikh from\nEl-Kalil bringing word to Ali Higg of the movements of a British\nforce! In what way did I become the friend of Ali Higg? Was I not\nalways his friend! Was it not I who fed him when he first escaped\nfrom Egypt! Ho-ho-ho! Have I not been working for a year to\ngather men for him in El-Kalil! Have I not made purchases in\nEl-Kalil and El-Kudz for his wife Ayisha! _Il hamdulillah!_ My\ntongue was ready! May the lies rot the belly of the fool\nwho ate them!\n\n\"But that was not all. He wanted to know other things--as, for\ninstance, whether the other force of forty men is still at large,\nand if so who shall protect the women in Petra.\n\n\"'For,' quoth he, `by Allah, there are men in the neighborhood\nwho have felt our Ali's heel, and who would not scruple to wreak\nvengeance if his back were altogether turned. Convey him my\nrespectful homage, and bid him look to his rear,' said Ibrahim\nben Ah.\"\n\nAt that Grim called to Narayan Singh, who came down the\ngoat-track like a landslide. You mustn't whistle your man in\nthose parts, or the Arabs will say the devil has defiled\nyour mouth.\n\n\"Ask Jael Higg to come here.\"\n\n\"A word first, Jimgrim sahib! While I watched, those women\ntalked. Jael, the older one, offered Ayisha forgiveness if she\nwould obey henceforth; but Ayisha gave her only hard words,\nsaying that in a day or so it will be seen whose cock crows\nloudest. So Jael called to two of the men who have been with\nAyisha all this time, and they squatted in the mouth of her cave.\nAs it was very dark I crept quite close and listened. She bade\nthem watch their chance and run to Ali Higg.\n\n\"'If he is ill and angry, never mind,' she said. `If he beats\nyou, never mind. He will reward you afterward. Bid him, as he\nvalues life,' she said, `call in those forty men whom he would\nsend to punish the Beni Aroun people. Tell him I am a prisoner,\nbut those forty are enough to turn the tables until Ibrahim ben\nAh can come. A camel must leave in a hurry for Ibrahim ben Ah at\nthe oasis, and bring him and all the men back to straighten\nthis affair.'\n\n\"She promised them money and promotion for success, and sure\ndeath for failure!\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Grim, turning to me. \"You see? It always pays to\nstage a close-up in a game like this. We've caught our friend Ali\nHigg between soup and fish.\"\n\n\"Get in quick, then, and kidnap him,\" I urged.\n\n\"Man alive,\" he answered, \"we've no kind of right to do that.\nBring her down,\" he told Narayan Singh, \"and then have Mujrim tie\nthose four men of Ayisha's so they've no chance to escape.\"\n\nJael Higg came down in a livid passion--altogether too near home\nto enjoy taking secondhand orders from an Indian in the dark. She\nwas still less amused when she discovered that Grim knew her\nlittle scheme.\n\n\"Well, Jael,\" he said, \"you weren't quite frank with me after\nall, were you? Which will you do now--stay in that hole up\nthere with a double guard, or come into Petra with us and\nbehave yourself?\"\n\nFor, I should say, a whole minute, she did not answer. You could\nnot tell in the dark, but I think she was fighting back tears,\nand too proud to betray it.\n\n\"I'm your prisoner,\" she hissed at last. \"Do what you like, and\ntake the consequences.\"\n\n\"I'll put you to no indignity, Jael, if you'll play fair.\"\n\n\"My God! What? Are you mad, or am I? What are you going to do\nwith Ali Higg?\"\n\n\"Make friends with him.\"\n\n\"You swear that?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\nShe was silent for another minute.\n\n\"Very well,\" she said at last. \"I'll do my best.\"\n\n\"Accepted,\" answered Grim. \"Now--bring down Ayisha--fetch out the\ncamels--mount--and forward all!\"\n\nWe went forward just as dawn was breaking, and I believe every\nman Jack of us except Grim had his heart in his teeth. Grim was\nlikely too busy conning over the plan in his head to feel afraid,\nthat being, as far as I could ever tell, the one lone advantage\nof being leader, just as the capacity to drive out fear by\nsteady thinking is as good a reason as exists for placing a\nman in command.\n\nNobody knows how old Petra is, but it was a thriving city when\nAbraham left Ur of the Chaldees, and for a full five thousand\nyears it has had but that one entrance, through a gorge that\nnarrows finally until only one loaded camel at a time can pass.\nArmy after army down the centuries have tried to storm the place,\nand failed, so that even the invincible Alexander and the Romans\nhad to fall back on the arts of friendship to obtain the key. We,\nthe last invaders, came as friends, if only Grim could persuade\nthe tyrant to believe it.\n\nThe sun rose over the city just as we reached the narrowest part\nof the gut, Grim leading, and its first rays showed that we were\nusing the bed of a watercourse for a road. Exactly in front of\nus, glimpsed through a twelve-foot gap between cliffs six hundred\nfeet high, was a sight worth going twice that distance, running\ntwice that risk, to see--a rose-red temple front, carved out\nof the solid valley wall and glistening in the opalescent\nhues of morning.\n\nNot even Burkhardt, who was the first civilized man to see the\nplace in a thousand years, described that temple properly;\nbecause you can't. It is huge--majestic--silent--empty--aglow\nwith all the prism colors in the morning sun. And it seems\nto think.\n\nIt takes you so by surprise when you first see it that in face of\nthat embodied mystery of ancient days your brain won't work, and\nyou want to sit spellbound. But Grim had done our thinking for\nus, so that we were not the only ones surprised. Such was the\nconfidence of safety that those huge walls and the narrow\nentrance to the place inspire that Ali Higg had set only four men\nto keep the gate; and they slept with their weapons beside them,\nnever believing that strangers would dare essay that ghost-haunted\nravine by night.\n\nThey were pounced on and tied almost before their eyes were open;\nand, catching sight of Jael Higg first, and getting only a\nglimpse of Grim, they rather naturally thought their chief had\ncaught them napping; so they neither cried out nor made any\nattempt to defend themselves; and presently, when they discovered\ntheir mistake, the fear of being crucified for having slept on\nduty kept them dumb.\n\nGrim led the way straight to that amazing temple, and we invaded\nit, camels and all, off-loading the camels inside in a hurry and\nthen driving them out again to lie down in the wide porch between\nthe columns and the temple wall. The porch was so vast that even\nall our string of camels did not crowd it.\n\nThe main part of the interior was a perfect cube of forty feet,\nall hand-hewn from the cliff, and there were numerous rooms\nleading out of it that had once been occupied by the priests of\nIsis, but \"the lion and the lizard\" had lived in them since their\nday. We put the prisoners, including Ayisha's four men, in one\nroom under guard.\n\nThat much was hardly accomplished when the spirit of our\nseventeen thieves reacted to their surroundings, and all the\nadvantage of our secret arrival was suddenly undone. Half of them\nhad gone outside to tie the camels, under Ali Baba's watchful\neye; and it was he, as a matter of fact, who started it. From\ninside we heard a regular din of battle commencing--loud shouts\nand irregular rifle-fire--and I followed Grim out in a hurry.\n\nThere was no enemy in sight. Old Ali Baba was busy reloading his\nrifle fifty paces away in front of the temple door, facing us\nwith his sons, in a semicircle around him, and they were shooting\nat something over our heads. Grim laughed rather bitterly.\n\n\"My mistake,\" he said. \"I ought to have thought of that.\"\n\nSo I went out to see.\n\nSurmounting the temple front, at least a hundred feet above the\npavement and perfectly inaccessible, was a beautifully carved\nstone urn surmounting a battered image of some god or goddess. It\nwas in shadow, because the cliff wall, from which the temple had\nbeen carved, overhung it; so it was peculiarly difficult to hit,\neven at that range; but they were all firing away at it as if Ali\nHigg and all his men were hidden behind the thing. There was no\nparticular need to stop them, for they had made noise enough\nalready to awake the very slumbering bones of Petra. Ali Baba\nadvised me to shoot too, and I asked him why.\n\n\"To burst the thing.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"That we make a profit from this venture.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\nHe paused to reload once more. He had already fired away about\nfifteen cartridges.\n\n\"Allah! The very dogs of El-Kalil have heard of Pharaoh's treasure.\"\n\n\"I am neither a dog,\" said I, \"nor an inhabitant of El-Kalil, for\nwhich Allah for his thoughtfulness be praised! Tell me what you\nand the dogs know.\"\n\n\"This place was the treasury of Pharaoh, King of Egypt, a bad\nking and an unbeliever, whom may Allah curse! In that urn are his\ngold and rubies. If we can crack it they will come tumbling down\nand we shall all be rich.\"\n\n_\"Mashallah!_ You believe that? Why haven't Ali Higg and his men\ncracked it, then?\"\n\n_\"Shu halalk?_* I have told you Pharaoh was an evil king. He was\nin league with devils and bewitched the place. The devils guard\nit. May Allah twist their tails! Look--see! We shoot, but the\nbullets miss the mark each time!\"\n\n--------\n* What chatter is this?\n--------\n\n\"Perhaps you haven't prayed enough to exorcize the devils?\" I\nsuggested, and he dropped the butt of his rifle on the ground to\nconsider the proposition.\n\n\"Out of the mouth of an unbeliever has come wisdom before now,\"\nhe said. \"There may be truth in that.\"\n\nAnd he called all his sons and grandsons there and then to spread\ntheir mats and pray toward Mecca, performing the prescribed\nablutions first with water from one of the goatskin bags.\n\nWell, there wasn't any further use in trying to keep our\nmovements secret. Grim beckoned me to where he stood beside\nNarayan Singh, with Ayisha looking mischievous in the gloom\nbehind them, and issued final instructions.\n\n\"Present my compliments and these gifts to Ali Higg--I'm busy at\nprayer, remember--and say how greatly honored we feel to have\nescorted his wife across the desert. If he asks where her four\nmen are, tell him I'll bring them later. Be sure and make me out\na great sheikh, and say I heard he is sick, so sent my _hakim_ in\nadvance to give him relief; then do your best for him, if he'll\nlet you--after Ayisha has done her worst,\" he added in a whisper.\n\"Don't forget you're a _darwaish._ The more you jaw religion the\nbetter the old rascal will like you. See you soon. So long!\"\n\nSo Narayan Singh and I, followed by Ayisha and two of Ali Baba's\nsons, left that ancient temple bearing the medicine-chest as well\nas presents, and I hope the others did not feel as scared as I did.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\"Yet I Forgot to Speak of the Twenty Aeroplanes!\"\n\n\n\nYou can expect anything, of course, of Arabs. People who will\npitch black cotton tents in the scorching sun, and live in them\nin preference to gorgeous cool stone temples because of the\ndevils and ghosts that they believe to haunt those habitable\nsplendors, will believe anything at all except the truth, and act\nin any way except reasonably. So I tried to believe it was all\nright to be unreasonable too.\n\nYou would think, wouldn't you, that a man who had set himself up\nto be the holy terror of a country-side and put his heel on the\nnecks of all the tribes for miles around, would have made use at\nleast of the caves and tombs to strengthen his position. There\nwere thousands of them all among those opal-colored cliffs, to\nsay nothing of ruined buildings; yet not one was occupied. Ayisha\nhad told most of the truth when she said in El-Kalil that her\npeople lived in tents.\n\nWe walked down the paved street of a city between oleander bushes\nthat had forced themselves up between the cracks, toward an\nenormous open amphitheater hewn by the Romans out of a hillside,\nwith countless tiers of ruined stone seats rising one above the\nother like giant steps.\n\nIn the center of that the tents were pitched, and the only\nbuilding in use was a great half-open cave on another hillside,\nin which Ayisha told us Ali Higg himself lived, overlooking the\nentire camp and directing its destinies.\n\nOn the top of the mountain in front of us was the tomb of Aaron,\nMoses' brother. On another mountain farther off stood a great\ncrusader castle all in ruins; and to left and right were endless\nremains of civilization that throve when the British were living\nin mud-and-wattle huts. The dry climate had preserved it all; but\nthere was water enough; it only needed the labor of a thousand\nmen to remake a city of it.\n\nWe avoided the amphitheater with its hundreds of tents pitched\ninside and all about it, because Ayisha said the women would come\nrunning out to greet her, and she did not desire that any more\nthan we did. So we turned to the right, and started up a flight\nof steps nearly a mile long that led to an ancient place of\nsacrifice; two hundred yards up that the track turned off that\nled to Ali Higg's cavern.\n\nIt was there, where the broken steps and sidetrack met, that the\nfirst men came hurrying to meet us and blocked our way--four of\nthem, active as goats, and looking fierce enough to scare away\ntwice their number. But they recognized Ayisha, and stood aside\nat once to let us pass, showing her considerable gruff respect\nand asking a string of questions, which she countered with\nplatitudes. They did not follow us, but stayed on guard at the\ncorner, as if the meeting between Ali Higg and his wife were\nsomething to keep from prying eyes.\n\nSo the far-famed Ali Higg was alone in his great cave when we\nreached it, sitting near the entrance propped on skins and\ncushions with a perfect armory of weapons on the floor beside\nhim. The interior was hung with fine Bokhara embroideries, and\nevery inch of the floor was covered with rugs.\n\nThere was another cave opening into that in which he sat; and it,\ntoo, was richly decorated; but the sound of women's voices that\nwe heard came from a third cave around the corner of the cliff\nwall, not connected. Ali Higg was apparently in no mood for\nfemale company--or any other kind.\n\nIn the shadow of the overhanging rock he looked so like Grim it\nwas laughable. He was a caricature of our man, with all the\nrefinement and humor subtly changed into irritable anger. He\nlooked as if he would scream if you touched him, and no wonder;\nfor the back of the poor fellow's neck, half hidden by the folds\nof his head-cloth, was a perfect mess of boils that made every\nmovement of his head an agony.\n\nHis eyes were darker than Grim's, and blazed as surely no white\nman's ever did; and his likeness to Grim was lessened by the fact\nthat he had not been shaved for a day or two, and the sparse\nblack hair coarsened the outline of his chin and jaw. In spite of\nhis illness he had not laid aside the bandolier that crossed his\nbreast, nor the two daggers tucked into his waist-cloth. And he\nlaid his hand on a modern British Army rifle the minute he caught\nsight of us.\n\nNarayan Singh and I both bowed and, after greeting him with the\nproper sonorous blessing, stood aside to let Ayisha approach. We\nshould have demeaned ourselves in his eyes, and hers as well, if\nwe had walked behind her. He nodded to us curtly, and almost\nsmiled at her; but that one wry twist of his lips was his nearest\napproach to pleasantry that morning.\n\nShe knelt and kissed his hands and feet, waiting to speak until\nshe was spoken to; and he did not speak to her at all, but signed\nto her with a tap on the head and a gesture to take her place on\nthe rug behind him. Then at a motion from me Ali Baba's two sons\nbrought forward the presents and the medicine-chest, setting them\ndown before him in the cave-mouth.\n\nThe presents were pretty good, I thought. I would not have minded\nowning them myself; but he eyed them dully. There was a set of\nSolingen razors, marked in Arabic with the days of the week; a\ncloak of blue-and-white-striped cloth, fit for any prince of\nBedouins; and an ormolu clock with a gong inside it that would\nhave graced the chimneypiece of a Brooklyn boarding-house.\n\n_\"Mar'haba!\"_* he said at last, by way of acknowledging our\nexistence, after he had stared at the presents for about two\nminutes sourly; and I took that for permission to say my little\npiece. [* Greeting]\n\nSo I delivered Grim's message, saying that he was a most\nGod-fearing and hard-fighting sheikh from Palestine, who had had\nthe honor to escort his mightiness' wife to Petra, and now,\nlearning of the illness of the famous Lion of Petra, who might\nAllah bless for ever, rather than postpone his devotions had sent\nme, his _hakim,_ schooled in medicine at Lahore University, and a\n_darwaish_ to boot, to offer such relief as my modest skill\nmight compass.\n\nThat was a long speech to get off in Arabic for a comparative\nbeginner. I rather expected him to smile or say something\npleasant in return, but he didn't.\n\n\"By Allah, you have come to poison me!\" he growled. \"All _hakims_\nare alike. There was an Egyptian tried it a month ago. Look\nyonder on the ledge, where his skull hangs. May devils burn\nhis soul!\"\n\nIt was easy enough to look shocked at that suggestion. He had the\ndrop on me for one thing; and, for another, Ayisha was whispering\nto him, and I couldn't guess whether she was betraying me or not.\nIt turned out that that young woman was much too bent on swapping\nowners to do anything but smooth our path; but I wasn't so sure\nof that then as Narayan Singh seemed to be, and as, for that\nmatter, Grim was too.\n\nBut he seemed to grow a little less irascible, until she leaned\ntoo close to him and touched his neck. Then he went off like a\npent-up volcano, and cursed her until she shuddered; and her\nfright gave him no satisfaction, because he could not turn his\nhead to look at her.\n\n\"Where is this cursed person?\" he demanded, meaning Grim,\nof course.\n\n\"He rests at the treasury of Pharaoh,\" said I, hoping that as\nNarayan Singh and I both stood exactly in front of him he might\nnot catch sight of Grim's movements in the valley below.\n\n\"How did he enter Petra without my leave?\" he demanded.\n\nI took a long pause, for that was an awkward question. I could\nnot very well admit that Grim had seized and imprisoned his\nwatchmen. But Narayan Singh strode into the breach.\n\n\"The Lion's jackals slept,\" he announced in a voice of righteous\nindignation. \"There was none to give our great Sheikh Jimgrim as\nmuch as Allah's blessing. Nevertheless, he sends these presents.\"\n\nWithout answering that Ali Higg clapped his hands twice, and a\nwoman came around the corner from a near-by cave. By her bearing\nshe was either a junior wife or a concubine, and she greeted\nAyisha like a sister with a great pow-wow of blessing and reply.\nBut Ali Higg cut all that short. He was no sentimentalist.\n\n\"Find Shammas Abdul,\" he ordered her. \"Order him to take camel\nand meet the men returning from the Ben Aroun raid. Let him bid\nthem hurry. Go!\"\n\nShe obeyed on the run. There was discipline in that man's camp,\nas long as he was looking. But Ayisha followed the woman out, and\nwhether she herself found Shammas Abdul, or whether she contrived\nto pervert the junior wife, Grim presently became aware of that\nmove to summon forth men, and governed himself accordingly.\n\nFor about a minute Ali Higg fixed baleful eyes on me.\n\n\"You are a Shia!\" he snapped suddenly. \"A Persian! A cursed heretic!\"\n\nA look of pained surprise was the best retort I could accomplish;\nbut Narayan Singh came to the rescue again. He thumped a fist on\nhis chest as if it were a drum, and glared indignantly.\n\n\"Would I, a Pathan of the Orakzai, demean myself by being servant\nto a Persian?\" he demanded. \"Lo! We bring gifts. What manner of\ndesert man are you that reward us with insults!\"\n\n\"Peace!\" I said. \"Peace!\" remembering the Sikh's counsel about\nthe middle course I should pursue. \"The Lion is sick. May Allah\ntake pity on him!\"\n\nNarayan Singh growled in his beard by way of submitting to the mild\nrebuke, and Ali Higg--a little bit impressed perhaps--proceeded\nto question me on doctrine and theology, showing a zeal for\nsplitting hairs that would have done credit to a Cairo _m'allim._\nBut I had had lots of instruction on those points, and in fact\nsurprised him with a trite fanaticism equal to his own, ending\nwith a statement that whoever did not believe every article\nand precept of the Sunni faith not only was damned forever\nbeyond hope, but should be despatched in a hurry to face\nthe dreadful consequences.\n\nHis eyes softened considerably at that; and for the moment I\nthink he almost approved of me, in spite of the foreign accent\nthat must have grated on his ears, and his national dislike of\nany one who hailed from India. He actually told both of us to be\nseated, and clapped his hands again. Another woman came, looking\ndreadfully afraid of him.\n\n\"Coffee!\" he ordered.\n\nWe sat down on the ledge of rock in front of him, for although it\nwas hardly wise to seem too deferent, it would have been most\nunwise to move away and give him an unobstructed view of the\nvalley, where Grim might be in sight or might not be. Our job was\nto gain time.\n\nHe did not say a word until the coffee came, beyond swearing\nscandalously when he moved his head and the boils hurt.\n\n\"O Allah, may Your neck hurt You as mine does me!\"\n\nI thought that pretty good for such a hard-and-fast doctrinaire,\nbut it was almost mild compared to some of his other remarks.\n\nThe woman brought the coffee on a tray in little silver cups--as\ngood and as well served as if our host were a Cairene pasha; but\nour irascible host took none, for Ayisha called out and warned\nhim not to, saying it would heat his boils.\n\nShe came like the wife of Heber the Kenite, who slew Sisera,\n\"bringing forth butter in a lordly dish.\" She held in both hands\na marvelous Persian rose-bowl half filled with clabber, saying\nshe had prepared it for her lord herself, and offered it to him\non bended knees.\n\nI could not see her face, for her back was toward me and she had\nher shawl over her head; but I thought of that little vial of\ncroton oil Narayan Singh had given her instead of poison, and the\nSikh caught my eye meaningly.\n\nAli Higg was pleased to condescend. He took the bowl in both\nhands, muttered a blessing, and drank deep, swallowing about half\nthe stuff before he noticed its strange flavor. Then he flung the\npriceless bowl away from him, smashing it to atoms, and picked up\nhis rifle to take an aim at Ayisha.\n\n\"By Allah, the bint* has poisoned me!\"\n\n---------\n* Literally girl; about as respectful as the word \"skirt\" would\nbe if used of one's wife.\n---------\n\nShe screamed and ran. He fired, but she was already past the\ncorner, and the bullet grazed the rock. Moreover, croton oil is a\ndrastic cathartic, and waits on no man's convenience. He dropped\nthe rifle, groaned--and I would rather not set down quite all\nthe rest.\n\nSufficient that it gave Narayan Singh and me our opportunity. It\nmade him too weak to resist, and we took care of him. I let him\ngo on believing he was poisoned, and gave him harmless doses that\nhe presently believed had saved his life; so that even the\ntyrannical fanatic felt a kind of gratitude.\n\nHeld like a baby in the Sikh's enormous arms with no less than\nhalf a dozen terrified women looking on--for they had all run one\nway while Ayisha ran the other--he slowly recovered control of\nhis emotions, while the women loudly praised my medicinal skill.\n\nAnd since I knew almost nothing at all of medicine, and therefore\ncould say anything I chose without feeling guilty--like the\nfellow on a soapbox who harangues a crowd on politics--I told him\nhe must have the boils lanced there and then, or otherwise the\npoison might get to them and inflame them beyond all hope.\n\nI suppose the men who had met us at the corner of the great\nflight of steps did not come and interrupt because they had had\nenough of his temper for one morning and did not choose to sample\nit again uninvited. The rifle-shot did not bring them, because it\nwas nothing new for him to vent displeasure by shooting at folk;\nand if there were a corpse, and it had not fallen over the cliff\nor been kicked over, they would come and remove it when ordered,\nbut certainly not sooner.\n\nAli Higg has strength enough left to assure me that if I killed\nhim he would wait for me in the next world and settle the account\nthere. I told him what was perfectly true, that I would rather\nlose my hand than kill him, so he added that if I hurt him more\nthan was reasonable four camels should be told off afterward to\nhurt me.\n\nSeeing he was to be sole judge of what was reasonable pain, and\nhaving no means of guessing whether Grim was still alive and able\nto protect me, I decided to give him a hypodermic, and put a shot\ninto his arm that would have quieted a _must_ elephant. Maybe I\nrather overdid that, but as I have no medical diploma nobody can\ncall me to account.\n\nAnd the operation was successful, if unpleasant. I used one of\nthe presentation razors.\n\nThen Grim came striding up the mountain-ledge, with Ali Baba and\nall the rest of the gang at his tail, but no sign anywhere of\nJael Higg. He stood and boomed out a sonorous Arab blessing; and\nif ever a man felt and looked like a trapped wild beast it was\nthat Lord of the Limits of the Desert and Lion of Petra, Ali Higg.\n\nHowever, Narayan Singh and I had played our part and got him weak\nenough; he could not even jump to grab his rifle. The rest was\nclearly up to Grim, who looked in no hurry at all.\n\nHe stood in the cave entrance with the light behind him, turning\nslightly sidewise to let Ali Higg see him in profile. The Lion's\njaw dropped. Grim's very head-dress was striped like Ali Higg's.\nHis cloak was the same color. He had been dressed rather\ndifferently when I last saw him, so he must have been doing some\npretty careful spy-work.\n\nOf course, a close examination showed a dozen differences between\nthe two men, but in his weak state following that drastic physic\nand the operation Ali Higg believed for a moment that he saw his\nown ghost! One or two of the women checked a scream, which helped\nmatters, and the others shrank into a corner, staring with wild\neyes. One woman laughed, but not from amusement.\n\n_\"Salamun alaik,_ O Ali Higg!\" said Grim after a full minute's silence.\n\n_\"Wa alaik issalam!_ Who are you, in the name of Allah?\"\n\nInstead of answering Grim strode in, and Ali Baba lined up his\nsons across the cave-mouth. Unless Grim had left undone some\nprecaution in the camp below it looked as if we had the Lion\ncaged to rights, and you could tell by the look in Ali Baba's\nusually mild old eyes that there would have been short shrift for\nsomebody if his advice were taken. For a moment I caught sight of\nAyisha peering timidly between the end man and the wall--to see,\nI suppose, whether the Lion was dead yet--but the minute I caught\nher eye she disappeared.\n\nGrim stooped down over Ali Higg, who was sprawling on his stomach\non a Persian rug.\n\n\"Has my _hakim_ relieved Your Honor's pain?\" he asked.\n\nThe Lion managed to sit upright. Three of the women piled\ncushions behind him and ran back again to their corner.\n\n\"Who are you in my likeness?\"\n\n\"A friend, _inshallah,\"_ answered Grim.\n\nHe squatted down cross-legged on the mat in front of him; for\nthough the Lion's neck was pretty nicely bandaged and the\nhypodermic had not lost its power, yet it hurt him quite a\nlittle to look up.\n\n\"I had three brothers, but thou art none of them. I had one\nson, but neither art thou he. In the name of the All-Knowing,\nname thyself!\"\n\n\"I am he,\" said Grim, \"who brought Your Honor's wife from El-Kalil.\"\n\n\"Oh! And a million curses on the bint! She tried within the hour\nto poison me. But for this Indian of thine I were a dead man now.\nStay! Send for her!\"\n\nHe clapped his hands.\n\n\"Let her be flung over the cliff. Go bring her!\" But nobody moved\nto do his bidding, and it dawned on him a second time that he was\ncornered. He wasn't a man who took such a discovery mildly.\n\n\"Ayisha shall be dealt with at the proper time!\" he snarled. \"I\nhave not accepted those gifts. Take them up! You who have entered\nPetra without my leave shall account to my men presently.\nThereafter we will talk of gifts.\"\n\n\"Which men?\" Grim asked him blandly. \"Surely not the forty and\nfour who went to raid the Beni Aroun? Nay, I took the liberty of\nsending them a message signed with Your Honor's seal. They will\nnot come for a day or two, so we can make friends undisturbed.\"\n\n_\"Shu halalk?_ With my seal?\"\n\n\"With Your Honor's seal. Observe; I have it.\"\n\n\"Then--then--Where is she into whose hands I gave it?\"\n\nThat was the first sign that Ali Higg had given of the slightest\naffection for any one. His face looked ghastly at the thought of\nlosing that strange, half-western wife of his.\n\nHe had called Ayisha by her name in front of strangers, out of\ndisrespect. Jael he would not name, even when confronted by the\nproof that she had broken trust and lost his precious seal.\n\n\"I took another liberty,\" said Grim. \"I sent word by messenger,\nwho bore a letter sealed with that same seal, to Ibrahim ben Ah.\nHe will neither raid El-Maan nor return to Petra.\"\n\n\"He is defeated?\" asked the Lion, dumbfounded. \"And she--is\nshe a prisoner?\"\n\nGrim did not answer either question.\n\n\"And I met a man named Yussuf. You know him?\"\n\n_\"Naam.\"_ (Yes).\n\n\"He has been lying to Your Honor. He has said that the British\nare helpless. He brought Your Honor a report from Palestine that\nwas a skein of falsehood hung up on little pegs of truth. He told\nyou the British are not able to defend themselves, he knowing\nbetter; for he is one of those men who say always what the hearer\nwould like to hear.\"\n\n\"What has that to do with thee?\" demanded Ali Higg.\n\nHe was looking about him furtively, and Narayan Singh picked up\nhis rifle off the rug and stood it against the wall. Grim turned\ntoward Ali Baba.\n\n\"Bring Yussuf!\" he ordered.\n\nThe ranks opened, and Yussuf was thrust forward into the cave,\nwhere he stood looking like a felon awaiting sentence.\n\n\"Did you speak the truth, or did you lie to the Lion of Petra?\"\nGrim demanded.\n\n\"Who am I that should know the truth of such matters?\" the man\nwhined, his voice squeaking like a cart-wheel. \"I obeyed. I\nlooked. I asked. Perhaps I did not understand all I saw and what\nwas told me.\"\n\n\"Is the Lion of Petra with ten-score fighting men able to stand\nagainst the British with twenty thousand?\" Grim asked him.\n\n_\"Inshallah._ The Lion is brave. Who knows? Yet I forgot to speak\nof the twenty aeroplanes at Ludd, each having ten bombs of a\nhundred pounds weight that could make short work in an hour or\ntwo of ten score men.\"\n\n\"Why don't they come?\" snarled Ali Higg.\n\n\"They take no delight in slaying the women and children,\"\nanswered Grim. \"Those black tents below there would be an easy\nmark to aim at; but who would gain? It is better that peace\nwere kept.\"\n\n\"Throw that Yussuf over the cliff!\" commanded Ali Higg.\n\nBut once more nobody moved to obey him, and Yussuf had the indecency\nto smirk, for which Grim cursed him with whiplash sarcasm.\n\nThen Ali Higg put both hands before his face and prayed aloud:\n\n\"O Allah, Lord of mercies and of wisdom and rebuke, if I am in\nthe hands of enemies and she who was the mother of good plans is\ntaken away from me, have I not, nevertheless, smitten the heretic\nin thy name and raised thy banner over Petra? Give me, then,\nwisdom, that I deal with these men and confound thy enemies. _La\nAllah illa Allah!\"_\n\nHe dropped his hands and looked up with a hard, fanatical frenzy\nin his eyes. But they changed almost instantly. The ranks of Ali\nBaba's men opened once more; and Jael Higg stepped through,\ndressed like a fighting Bedouin, bandolier and all. Grim had even\nlet her have a rifle and cartridges. As he promised, he had put\nher to no indignity.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\"There is a Trick to Ruling!\"\n\n\n\nDon't you hate a story with a moral in it? I do. This is an\nimmoral story. And, remember, I said in the beginning that it had\nno end, but was no more than an episode in the career of Ali\nHigg. I would have liked to tell it from his viewpoint setting\ndown what he thought of this unexpected stick thrown in his\nwheel, omitting most of the bad language for the censor's sake.\n\nHis first thought was that Jael had returned from the raid with a\nhundred and forty men. You could tell that by the light in his\neyes, even before he spoke.\n\n\"Allah reward you; you come in time! Have Ayisha and that Yussuf\nthrown over the cliff. Praised be Allah, I shall be obeyed at last!\"\n\nIt was his worst shock yet when even Jael did not start at once\nto carry out his order. Instead, she sat down on the rug, so that\nshe and Ali Higg and Grim formed a triangle.\n\n\"O Lion of Petra,\" she said--for it would not have been manners\nto call him by his right name in front of strangers--\"what was\nwritten has come to pass, and my foreboding was a true one. If we\nhad let the tribes at El-Maan be, and if you had kept those forty\nmen instead of sending them to raid the Beni Aroun, this could\nnot have happened. Now twenty men have cornered us, while Ibrahim\nben Ah eats up provisions to no purpose, sitting idly in\nthe desert.\"\n\n\"Then the El-Maan men were not scattered to the winds?\" groaned\nAli Higg. \"O Allah, may shame devour you as it tortures me! Those\ndogs will have looted a train and will say that Ali Higg no\nlonger dares interfere! The sun rises, but it sets at evening,\nsince Allah wills; but is my day so short?\"\n\n\"By no means,\" answered Grim. \"The El-Maan men saw me and\nbelieved I was the Lion of Petra. I forbade the looting of the\ntrain, and Your Honor's wife Ayisha went to El-Maan to enforce\nobedience by her presence.\n\n\"Later they saw me start for Petra when the train had passed; and\nnow they will learn that Ibrahim ben Ah with seven score men is\nbivouacking in the desert. The world is round, O Ali Higg, so\nthat where in one place it seems dark in another they say the sun\nis rising.\"\n\n\"In Allah's name, who art thou?\" asked the Lion.\n\n\"James Schuyler Grim. Men call me Jimgrim.\"\n\n\"Allah! _Wallahi haida fasl!_* Not he who fought under Lawrence\nagainst the Turks? _Wallah!_ I fought on the other side, but we\nall feared Lawrence and admired him so that not a man would try\nto capture him, although Djemal Pasha put a great price on his\nhead. And you were known far and wide as his man! There was a\nprice on your head too--dead or alive--five thousand pounds\nTurkish--well I remember it. By the beard of the Prophet, you\nmight have come here as a friend, O Jimgrim!\"\n\n------------\n* By Allah, this is a strange happening.\n------------\n\nGrim laughed.\n\n\"I come here as a friend in any case,\" he answered. _\"Khajjaltni\nbima'rufak!_* You brought back a woman to poison me!\"\n\n-----------\n* You shame me with your friendship!\n-----------\n\nAnd this is where the immorality comes in. I told a lie, and\ndon't regret it. Nor did Grim regret it; and he backed me up. And\nNarayan Singh supported both of us.\n\nThe lie was my own idea entirely, invented on the spur of the\nmoment; and afterward, when old Ali Baba named me The \"Father of\nLies\" on the strength of it I felt extremely proud, as he\nintended that I should do. The lie worked.\n\nI said:\n\n\"O Ali Higg, men said of you that you are a fierce man, swift in\nwrath and slow to take advice. And others said that you are sick\nwith burning boils; yet who shall go into the Lion's den and heal\nhim? And Ayisha said to me:\n\n\"'Thou art a _hakim,_ yet he will never listen to thee. But he is\nmy lord, and shall I see him linger in agony? Give me a potion\nthat will weaken him. Then in his weakness he will call for help,\nand thou shalt heal the boils. And afterward that which is\nwritten shall come to pass. If in great wrath because I mixed the\npotion in his drink he shall have me slain, nevertheless the Lion\nwill be whole again; and who am I compared to him?' So said the\nlady Ayisha.\"\n\nI know Grim would have given a hundred dollars for leave to laugh\nthen right out in meeting; but he kept a straight face, and he\nhad so contrived to make Jael Higg afraid of him that though she\nlooked scandalized she held her tongue. And Narayan Singh, as I\nsaid, supported me.\n\n\"These words are true, O Lion of Petra,\" he boomed out. \"I heard\nthe lady Ayisha speak, and it was I who put the little vial in\nher hands. By the beard of the Prophet I swear the words are true.\"\n\nBut as he is a Sikh, and therefore believes that the prophet of\nEl-Islam was a liar and impostor, with a beard as fit to be\ndishonored as his fiery creed, perhaps his perjury was scarcely\ntechnical. Anyhow, I am not the recording angel. And Grim said,\nbeing a more cautious liar than the rest of us:\n\n\"Therefore, O Lion of Petra, mercy is due to the lady Ayisha,\nseeing that the end in view was good, although the means\nwere questionable.\"\n\nBut Jael Higg looked daggers at her lord. She had made up her\nmind to reduce that establishment by one at least; and Ali Higg,\nlooking in her eyes, read what all polygamous husbands have had\nto face ever since the day when Abraham was forced to drive\nout Hagar into the wilderness. So he pronounced one of those\nSolomon-like judgments that are the secret of a man's rule over\nmen in that land, granting to each contender the whole of what he\nasked, yet having his own way in the bargain.\n\n\"I find she is not worthy of death,\" he said, \"since she played a\ntrick that brought me comfort. Yet I will not endure a woman's\ntricks, nor condone the offense. I divorce her. Before witnesses\nI say she is divorced.\"\n\nIt's a simple affair in that land, isn't it?\n\nBut there were matters not so simple to attend to, and Grim saw\nfit to waste no further time.\n\n\"I said I come as a friend,\" he resumed.\n\n\"I heard it!\" the Lion answered dryly.\n\n\"Without boasting, I have saved you from destruction, while\ndelivering your purchases from El-Kalil. And I have done your\nname no harm, but good on the country-side.\"\n\n\"Allah! How have you saved me from destruction?\"\n\n\"By preventing that unwise raid on El-Maan.\"\n\n_\"Wallahi!_ Do you think my men could not have accomplished it?\"\n\n\"Maybe. Do you think the British would be fools enough to let\nthat go unpunished? The El-Maan people would surely have appealed\nto them. Aeroplanes would have been sent to bomb you out of\nPetra. Can you fight aeroplanes?\"\n\n\"The British do not pretend to rule on this side of the Jordan,\"\nthe Lion retorted.\n\n\"No. Do you want them to pretend to?\"\n\n\"Allah forbid!\"\n\n\"Then take a friend's advice, O Ali Higg, and keep the peace here\nrather than make war.\"\n\n\"That is good advice; but will the British make a treaty with me?\"\n\n\"No,\" Grim answered, smiling. \"By that they would recognize\nyou as a ruler, which they will not do until they surely know\nyou rule.\"\n\n_\"Mashallah!_ How shall men know that I am a ruler unless I make\nwar and enforce my will?\"\n\n\"Have I made war on you?\" asked Grim. \"Have I disarmed you, or\nkilled one man? Yet I enforce my will, as you shall see.\"\n\n\"By a trick! You played a trick on me, or otherwise--\"\n\n\"There is a trick to ruling,\" answered Grim.\n\n\"By the beard of the Prophet, that is true! But show me a trick\nthat can defeat eight hundred men. The Sheikh of Abu Lissan plans\nto come against me. Those El-Mann dogs had heard of it, and so\nhad the Beni Aroun; therefore I planned to crush them first\nbefore dealing with Abu Lissan. Show me a trick that can defeat\nthe Abu Lissan men, and surely I will call thee friend!\"\n\n\"Suppose we make a bargain, then,\" said Grim.\n\n_\"Taib._ I am ready.\"\n\n\"Giving pledges for fulfilment.\"\n\n\"You mean I shall give pledges to the British?\"\n\n\"Hardly,\" Grim answered. \"If they took a pledge from you that\nwould be like signing a treaty, wouldn't it? I have no authority\nto sign a treaty. This must be a bargain between me and thee.\"\n\n_\"Taib.\"_\n\n\"It is known,\" said Grim, \"that you have money on deposit with\nthe Bank of Egypt.\"\n\n\"A lie! A lie!\" snapped Ali Higg. \"Who said it?\"\n\n\"Fifty thousand pounds in gold was the exact amount, deposited at\nsix percent, and interest to be compounded every half-year,\" said\nGrim. \"And because the Koran denounces usury by Moslems, and you\nare a pious man--and also perhaps because of the risk attached to\nusing your name in the matter--your wife Jael's name was used.\nNevertheless, your seal was used at the time as a check on her.\nNow, at a word from me the British would impound that money,\ninterest and all.\"\n\n\"A murrian on them! But you spoke of being friends?\"\n\n\"And of a pledge between you and me. In proof that I speak as a\nfriend, though I had your seal I have returned it.\"\n\nJael Higg confirmed that by displaying it in the hollow of\nher hand.\n\n\"You can't possibly prevent a message from me reaching British\nterritory,\" Grim went on. \"A letter is written already, and you\ndon't know which man has it. You are not my prisoner. I intend to\nleave you free and unharmed. It is possible you might attack me\nwhen I go, and kill me and some of my men; but the rest would\nescape. And then would come aeroplanes, and you would never see\nthat money in the Bank of Egypt.\"\n\nThe Lion blinked away steadily, looking so absurdly like Grim\nin some respects, and so utterly unlike him in character\nnevertheless, that it looked like plus opposing minus, or a\nstrong man tempted by his baser self.\n\n\"Therefore,\" continued Grim, \"if you will promise me to raid no\nmore villages I will undertake to deal with the Sheikh of Abu\nLissan. But as a pledge, Jael and you must sign and seal a letter\nto the Bank of Egypt stipulating that the fifty thousand pounds\nshall not be withdrawn for three years. As long as you keep your\npromise that money of yours shall be safe, with no questions\nasked as to how you came by it; for I shall not say a word about\nit to the British Government, making only a sealed report,\nwhich shall be locked away and never opened unless you break\nthe bargain.\"\n\n\"And at the end of three years?\"\n\n\"Who knows?\" Grim answered. \"The years are on the lap of Allah.\nBy then we may all be dead, or you may be king, or may be weary\nof politics--who knows?\"\n\n\"And if I refuse?\"\n\n\"Aeroplanes!\"\n\n\"But how shall I believe you?\"\n\n\"Do I not pledge my life?\" Grim answered. \"I have said that I\nwill go to Abu Lissan.\"\n\n\"Allah! Why don't you send the aeroplanes to Abu Lissan? Blot the\ndogs out! Destroy them! Why not?\"\n\n\"Would it not be easier to send them here?\" asked Grim. \"This is\nonly part way. You, who found it easier to crush the smaller\nfirst, tell me why the aeroplanes should not come first to Petra!\"\n\n_\"Wallahi!_ I wish I had aeroplanes!\"\n\n\"But you haven't. Choose now: Will you make that bargain with me,\nor shall I go straight back from here to Palestine and make my\nreport to the administrator? Never doubt that I can get back; I\nknow where your men are, and I know the desert trails as well as\nyou do. You and your few men that you have here and the women\nmight attack us in the Wady Musa,* but I would prevent that by\ntaking you and Jael with me until we reached the open.\"\n\n----------\n* The name of the valley that leads into Petra\n----------\n\n\"You talk boldly,\" the Lion sneered. \"If you think you can take\nus with you that far then why not to Jerusalem? The words of a\nboaster are a mask of doubt. Hah! Take us to Jerusalem! Why not?\"\n\n\"Because then,\" Grim answered, \"there would be ten-score\ncutthroats at large without a leader who can hold them. One\nLion can keep a bargain, but ten score jackals would ruin\na country-side.\"\n\nAli Higg turned that over in his mind for five full minutes, like\na chess player refusing to admit that he is mated. But there\nwasn't a move left to him, and Jael went closer on her knees to\nwhisper advice in his ear.\n\n\"I agree,\" he said at last. \"As Allah is my witness, I agree. Let\nus be friends, O Jimgrim!\"\n\nGrim shook hands with him and offered him a cigarette, while Ali\nBaba's men outside the cave sent up a great shout of victory.\nThen to Ali Higg's inexpressible delight Mahommed started to sing\nthe Akbar song, and they all roared the chorus:\n\n_\"Akbar! Akbar! Akbar Ali Higg!\"_\n\nThe song put everybody in good temper, so that when Jael wrote\nout a letter to the bank at Grim's dictation Ali Higg affixed the\nseal to it without a murmur and ordered food supplied at once to\nall Grim's men; and we had a feast up there on the ledge outside\nthe cave--in sight of the very spot where Amaziah, King of\nIsrael, once hurled ten thousand of his enemies into the\ngorge below--that, in some respects, was the most enjoyable\nI ever shared.\n\nBut Grim was not the man to spoil success by lingering in what\nmight yet turn into a trap. He who sups with the devil should not\nsit long at the feast; and I warned you this was a story without\nan end to it.\n\nThere is the lady Ayisha, and what became of her, and the account\nof when and in what way the Lion kept his bargain. Well, have you\nheard of those tale-tellers in the East, who sit under a village\ntree with the menfolk all around them? They work up to the\nclimax, and then pause, and pass the begging-bowl for whatever\nthe tale is worth. I fear those masters of inducement would mock\nme as a tyro for having already told too much before the pause!\n\n\n_The End_\n\n------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Lion of Petra, by Talbot Mundy\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE LION OF PETRA ***\n\n***** This file should be named 19307.txt or 19307.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/9/3/0/19307/\n\nProduced by Mark R.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
