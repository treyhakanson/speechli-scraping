The Turko-Italian\nWar had not been fought when Fred Oakes took the fever of the place,\nalthough the stage was pretty nearly set for it and most of the\nleading actors were waiting for their cue.  No more history was\nneeded than to grind away forgotten loveliness.\n\nFred's is the least sweet temper in the universe when the ague grips\nand shakes him, and he knows history as some men know the Bible--by\nfathoms;  he cursed the place conqueror by conqueror, maligning them\nfor their city's sake, and if Sennacherib, who built the first\nfoundations, and if Anthony and Cleopatra, Philip of Macedon,\nTimour-i-lang, Mahmoud, Ibrahim and all the rest of them could have\ncome and listened by his bedside they would have heard more personal\nscandal of themselves than ever their contemporary chroniclers dared\nreveal.\n\nAll this because he insisted on ignoring the history he knew so\nwell, and could not be held from bathing in the River Cydnus.\nWhatever their indifference to custom, Anthony and Cleopatra knew\nbetter than do that.  Alexander the Great, on the other hand, flouted\ntradition and set Fred the example, very nearly dying of the ague\nfor his pains, for those are treacherous, chill waters.\n\nFred, being a sober man and unlike Alexander of Macedon in several\nother ways, throws off fever marvelously, but takes it as some persons\ndo religion, very severely for a little while.  So we carried him\nand laid him on a nice white cot in a nice clean room with two beds\nin it in the American mission, where they dispense more than royal\nhospitality to utter strangers.  Will Yerkes had friends there but\nthat made no difference;  Fred was quinined, low-dieted, bathed,\ncomforted and reproved for swearing by a college-educated nurse,\nwho liked his principles and disapproved of his professions just\nas frankly as if he came from her hometown.  (Her name was\nVan-something-or-other, and you could lean against the Boston\naccent--just a little lonely-sounding, but a very rock of gentle\nindependence, all that long way from home!)\n\nMeanwhile, we rested.  That is to say that, after accepting as much\nmission hospitality as was decent, considering that every member of\nthe staff worked fourteen hours a day and had to make up for attention\nshown to us by long hours bitten out of night, we loafed about the\ncity.  And Satan still finds mischief.\n\nWe called on Fred in the beginning twice a day, morning and evening,\nbut cut the visits short for the same reason that Monty did not go\nat all:  when the fever is on him Fred's feelings toward his own\nsex are simply blunt bellicose.  When they put another patient in\nthe spare bed in his room we copied Monty, arguing that one male\nat a time for him to quarrel with was plenty.\n\nMonty, being Earl of Montdidier and Kirkudbrightshire, and a privy\ncouncilor, was welcome at the consulate at Mersina, twenty miles\naway.\n\nThe consul, like Monty, was an army officer, who played good chess,\nso that that was no place, either, for Will Yerkes and me.  Will\nprefers dime novels, if he must sit still, and there was none.  And\nbesides, he was never what you could call really sedative.\n\nHe and I took up quarters at the European hotel--no sweet abiding-place.\nThere were beetles in the Denmark butter that they pushed on to the\nfilthy table-cloth in its original one-pound tin;  and there was a\nTurkish officer in riding pants and red morocco slippers, back from\nthe Yemen with two or three incurable complaints.  He talked out-of-date\nTurkish politics in bad French and eked out his ignorance of table\nmanners with instinctive racial habit.\n\nTo avoid him between meals Will and I set out to look at the historic\nsights, and exhausted them all, real and alleged, in less than half\na day (for in addition to a lust for ready-cut building stone the\nTurks have never cherished monuments that might accentuate their\nown decadence).  After that we fossicked in the manner of prospectors\nthat we are by preference, if not always by trade, eschewing polite\nsociety and hunting in the impolite, amusing places where most of\nthe facts have teeth, sharp and ready to snap, but visible.\n\nWe found a khan at last on the outskirts of the city, almost in sight\nof the railway line, that well agreed with our frame of mind.  It\nwas none of the newfangled, underdone affairs that ape hotels, with\nGreek managers and as many different prices for one service as there\nare grades of credulity, but a genuine two-hundred-year-old Turkish\nplace, run by a Turk, and named Yeni Khan (which means the new rest\nhouse) in proof that once the world was younger.  The man who directed\nus to the place called it a kahveh;  but that means a place for donkeys\nand foot-passengers, and when we spoke of it as kahveh to the obadashi--the\nelderly youth who corresponds to porter, bell-boy and chambermaid\nin one--he was visibly annoyed.\n\nTruly the place was a khan--a great bleak building of four high outer\nwalls, surrounding a courtyard that was a yard deep with the dung\nof countless camels, horses, bullocks, asses;  crowded with arabas,\nthe four-wheeled vehicles of all the Near East, and smelly with\ncenturies of human journeys' ends.\n\nKhans provide nothing except room, heat and water (and the heat costs\nextra);  there is no sanitation for any one at any price;  every\nguest dumps all his discarded rubbish over the balcony rail into\nthe courtyard, to be trodden and wheeled under foot and help build\nthe aroma.  But the guests provide a picture without price that with\nthe very first glimpse drives discomfort out of mind.\n\nIn that place there were Parthians, Medes and Elamites, and all the\nrest of the list.  There was even a Chinaman.  Two Hindus were unpacking\nbundles out of a creaking araba, watched scornfully by an unmistakable\nPathan.  A fat swarthy-faced Greek in black frock coat and trousers,\nfez, and slippered feet gesticulated with his right arm like a pump-handle\nwhile he sat on the balcony-rail and bellowed orders to a crowd mixed\nof Armenians, Italians, Maltese, Syrians and a Turk or two, who labored\nwith his bales of cotton goods below.  (The Italians eyed everybody\nsidewise, for there were rumors in those days of impending trouble,\nand when the Turk begins hostilities he likes his first opponents\neasy and ready to hand.)\n\nThere were Kurds, long-nosed, lean-lipped and suspicious, who said\nvery little, but hugged long knives as they passed back and forth\namong the swarming strangers.  They said nothing at all, those Kurds,\nbut listened a very great deal.\n\nTall, mustached Circassians, with eighteen-inch Erzerum daggers at\ntheir waists, swaggered about as if they, and only they, were history's\nheirs.  It was expedient to get out of their path alertly, but they\ncringed into second place before the Turks, who, without any swagger\nat all, lorded it over every one.  For the Turk is a conqueror,\nwhatever else he ought to be.  The poorest Turkish servant is\nrace-conscious, and unshakably convinced of his own superiority to\nthe princes of the conquered.  One has to bear that fact in mind\nwhen dealing with the Turk;  it colors all his views of life, and\naccounts for some of his famous unexpectedness.\n\nWill and I fell in love with the crowd, and engaged a room over the\ngreat arched entrance.  We were aware from the first of the dull red\nmarks on the walls of the room, where bed-bugs had been slain with\nslipper heels by angry owners of the blood;  but we were not in search\nof luxury, and we had our belongings and a can of insect-bane brought\ndown from the hotel at once.  The fact that stallions squealed and\nfought in the stalls across the courtyard scarcely promised us\nuninterrupted sleep;  but sleep is not to be weighed in the balance\nagainst the news of eastern nights.\n\nWe went down to the common room close beside the main entrance, and\npushed the door open a little way;  the men who sat within with their\nbacks against it would only yield enough to pass one person in gingerly\nat a time.  We saw a sea of heads and hats and faces.  It looked\nimpossible to squeeze another human being in among those already\nseated on the floor, nor to make another voice heard amid all that\nbabel.\n\nBut the babel ceased, and they did make room for us--places of honor\nagainst the far wall, because of our clean clothes and nationality.\nWe sat wedged between a Georgian in smelly, greasy woolen jacket,\nand a man who looked Persian but talked for the most part French.\nThere were other Persians beyond him, for I caught the word poul--money,\nthe perennial song and shibboleth of that folk.\n\nThe day was fine enough, but consensus of opinion had it that snow\nwas likely falling in the Taurus Mountains, and rain would fall the\nnext day between the mountains and the sea, making roads and fords\nimpassable and the mountain passes risky.  So men from the ends of\nearth sat still contentedly, to pass earth's gossip to and fro--an\nastonishing lot of it.  There was none of it quite true, and some\nof it not nearly true, but all of it was based on fact of some sort.\n\nMen who know the khans well are agreed that with experience one learns\nto guess the truth from listening to the ever-changing lies.  We\ncould not hope to pick out truth, but sat as if in the pit of an\nold-time theater, watching a foreign-language play and understanding\nsome, but missing most of it.\n\nThere was a man who drew my attention at once, who looked and was\ndressed rather like a Russian--a man with a high-bridged, prominent,\nlean nose--not nearly so bulky as his sheepskin coat suggested, but\nactive and strong, with a fiery restless eye.  He talked Russian\nat intervals with the men who sat near him at the end of the room\non our right, but used at least six other languages with any one\nwho cared to agree or disagree with him.  His rather agreeable voice\nhad the trick of carrying words distinctly across the din of countless\nothers.\n\n\"What do you suppose is that man's nationality?\" I asked Will, shouting\nto him because of the roar, although he sat next me.\n\n\"Ermenie!\" said a Turk next but one beyond Will, and spat venomously,\nas if the very name Armenian befouled his mouth.\n\nBut I was not convinced that the man with the aquiline nose was Armenian.\nHe looked guilty of altogether too much zest for life, and laughed\ntoo boldly in Turkish presence.  In those days most Armenians thereabouts\nwere sad.  I called Will's attention to him again.\n\n\"What do you make of him?\"\n\n\"He belongs to that quieter party in the opposite corner.\"  (Will\nputs two and two together all the time, because the heroes of dime\nnovels act that way.)       \"They're gipsies, yet I'd say he's not--\"\n\n\"He and the others are jingaan,\" said a voice beside me in English,\nand I looked into the Persian's gentle brown eyes.  \"The jingaan\nare street robbers pure and simple,\" he added by way of explanation.\n\n\"But what nationality?\"\n\n\"Jingaan might be anything.  They in particular would call themselves\nRommany.  We call them Zingarri.  Not a dependable people--unless--\"\n\nI waited in vain for the qualification.  He shrugged his shoulders,\nas if there was no sense in praising evil qualities.\n\nBut I was not satisfied yet.  They were swarthier and stockier than\nthe man who had interested me, and had indefinite, soft eyes.  The\nman I watched had brown eyes, but they were hard.  And, unlike them,\nhe had long lean fingers and his gestures were all extravagant.\nHe was not a Jew, I was sure of that, nor a Syrian, nor yet a Kurd.\n\n\"Ermenie--Ermenie!\" said the Turk, watching me curiously, and spitting\nagain.  \"That one is Ermenie.  Those others are just dogs!\"\n\nThe crowd began to thin after a while, as men filed out to feed cattle\nand to cook their own evening meal.  Then the perplexing person got\nup and came over toward me, showing no fear of the Turk at all.\nHe was tall and lean when he stood upright, but enormously strong\nif one could guess correctly through the bulky-looking outer garment.\n\nHe stood in front of Will and me, his strong yellow teeth gleaming\nbetween a black beard and mustache.  The Turk got up clumsily, and\nwent out, muttering to himself.  I glanced toward the corner where\nthe self-evident gipsies sat, and observed that with perfect unanimity\nthey were all feigning sleep.\n\n\"Eenglis sportmen!\" said the man in front of us, raising both hands,\npalms outward, in appraisal of our clothes and general appearance.\n\nIt was not surprising that he should talk English, for what the British\nthemselves have not accomplished in that land of a hundred tongues\nhas been done by American missionaries, teaching in the course of\na generation thousands on thousands.  (There is none like the American\nmissionary for attaining ends at wholesale.)\n\n\"What countryman are you?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Zeitoonli,\" he answered, as if the word were honor itself and explanation\nbound in one.  Yet he looked hardly like an honorable man.  \"The\nchilabi are staying here?\" he asked.  Chilabi means gentleman.\n\n\"We wait on the weather,\" said I, not caring to have him turn the\ntables on me and become interrogator.\n\nHe laughed with a sort of hard good humor.\n\n\"Since when have Eenglis sportmen waited on the weather?  Ah, but\nyou are right, effendi, none should tell the truth in this place,\nunless in hope of being disbelieved!\"  He laid a finger on his right\neye, as I have seen Arabs do when they mean to ascribe to themselves\nunfathomable cunning.  \"Since you entered this common room you have\nnot ceased to observe me closely.  The other sportman has watched\nthose Zingarri.  What have you learned?\"\n\nHe stood with lean hands crossed now in front of him, looking at\nus down his nose, not ceasing to smile, but a hint less at his ease,\na shade less genial.\n\n\"I have heard you--and them--described as jingaan,\" I answered, and\nhe stiffened instantly.\n\nWhether or not they took that for a signal--or perhaps he made another\nthat we did not see--the six undoubted gipsies got up and left the\nroom, shambling out in single file with the awkward gait they share\nin common with red Indians.\n\n\"Jingaan,\" he said, \"are people who lurk in shadows of the streets\nto rob belated travelers.  That is not my business.\"  He looked very\nhard indeed at the Persian, who decided that it might as well be\nsupper-time and rose stiffly to his feet.  The Persians rob and murder,\nand even retreat, gracefully.  He bade us a stately and benignant\ngood evening, with a poetic Persian blessing at the end of it.  He\nbowed, too, to the Zeitoonli, who bared his teeth and bent his head\nforward something less than an inch.\n\n\"They call me the Eye of Zeitoon!\" he announced with a sort of savage\npride, as soon as the Persian was out of ear-shot.\n\nWill pricked his ears--schoolboy-looking ears that stand out from\nhis head.\n\n\"I've heard of Zeitoon.  It's a village on a mountain, where a man\nsteps out of his front door on to a neighbor's roof, and the women\nwear no veils, and--\"\n\nThe man showed his teeth in another yellow smile.\n\n\"The effendi is blessed with intelligence!  Few know of Zeitoon.\"\n\nWill and I exchanged glances.\n\n\"Ours,\" said Will, \"is the best room in the khan, over the entrance\ngate.\"\n\n\"Two such chilabi should surely live like princes,\" he answered without\na smile.  If he had dared say that and smile we would have struck\nhim, and Monty might have been alive to-day.  But he seemed to know\nhis place, although he looked at us down his nose again in shrewd\nappraisal.\n\nWill took out tobacco and rolled what in the innocence of his Yankee\nheart he believed was a cigarette.  I produced and lit what he\ncontemptuously called a \"boughten cigaroot\"--Turkish Regie, with\nthe scent of aboriginal ambrosia.  The Zeitoonli took the hint.\n\n\"Yarim sa' at,\" he said. \"Korkakma!\"\n\n\"Meanin'?\" demanded Will.\n\n\"In half an hour.  Do not be afraid!\" said he.\n\n\"Before I grow afraid of you,\" Will retorted, \"you'll need your friends\nalong, and they'll need knives!\"\n\nThe Zeitoonli bowed, laid a finger on his eye again, smiled and backed\naway.  But he did not leave the room.  He went back to the end-wall\nagainst which he had sat before, and although he did not stare at\nus the intention not to let us out of sight seemed pretty obvious.\n\n\"That half-hour stuff smacked rather of a threat,\" said Will.  \"Suppose\nwe call the bluff, and keep him waiting.  What do you say if we go\nand dine at the hotel?\"\n\nBut in the raw enthusiasm of entering new quarters we had made up\nour minds that afternoon to try out our new camp kitchen--a contraption\nof wood and iron we had built with the aid of the mission carpenter.\nAnd the walk to the hotel would have been a long one, through Tarsus\nmud in the dark, with prowling dogs to take account of.\n\n\"I'm not afraid of ten of him!\" said I.  \"I know how to cook curried\neggs;  come on!\"\n\n\"Who said who was afraid?\"\n\nSo we went out into darkness already jeweled by a hundred lanterns,\ndodged under the necks of three hungry Bactrian camels (they are\nirritable when they want their meal), were narrowly missed by a mule's\nheels because of the deceptive shadows that confused his aim, tripped\nover a donkey's heel-rope, and found our stairway--thoroughly well\ncursed in seven languages, and only just missed by a Georgian gentleman\non the balcony, who chose the moment of our passing underneath to\nempty out hissing liquid from his cooking pot.\n\nOnce in our four-square room, with the rags on the floor in our especial\nhonor, and our beds set up, and the folding chairs in place, contentment\ntook hold of us;  and as we lighted the primus burner in the cooking\nbox, we pitied from the bottom of compassionate young hearts all\nunfortunates in stiff white shirts, whose dinners were served that\nnight on silver and laundered linen.\n\nThrough the partly open door we could smell everything that ever\nhappened since the beginning of the world, and hear most of the elemental\nmusic--made, for instance, of the squeal of fighting stallions, and\nthe bray of an amorous he-ass--the bubbling complaint of fed camels\nthat want to go to sleep, but are afraid of dreaming--the hum of\nhuman voices--the clash of cooking pots--the voice of a man on the\nroof singing falsetto to the stars (that was surely the Pathan!)--the\ntinkling of a three-stringed instrument--and all of that punctuated\nby the tapping of a saz, the little tight-skinned Turkish drum.\n\nIt is no use for folk whose finger-nails were never dirty, and who\nnever scratched themselves while they cooked a meal over the primus\nburner on the floor, to say that all that medley of sounds and smells\nis not good.  It is very good indeed, only he who is privileged must\nunderstand, or else the spell is mere confusion.\n\nThe cooking box was hardly a success, because bright eyes watching\nthrough the open door made us nervously amateurish.  The Zeitoonli\narrived true to his threat on the stroke of the half-hour, and we\ncould not shut the door in his face because of the fumes of food\nand kerosene.  (Two of the eggs, like us, were travelers and had\nbeen in more than one bazaar.)\n\nBut we did not invite him inside until our meal was finished, and\nthen we graciously permitted him to go for water wherewith to wash\nup.  He strode back and forth on the balcony, treading ruthlessly\non prayer-mats (for the Moslem prays in public like the Pharisees\nof old).\n\n\"Myself I am Christian,\" he said, spitting over the rail, and sitting\ndown again to watch us.  We accepted the remark with reservations.\n\nWhen we asked him in at last, and we had driven out the flies with\nflapping towels, he closed the door and squatted down with his back\nto it, we two facing him in our canvas-backed easy chairs.  He refused\nthe \"genuine Turkish\" coffee that Will stewed over the primus.  Will\ndrank the beastly stuff, of course, to keep himself in countenance,\nand I did not care to go back on a friend before a foreigner, but\nI envied the man from Zeitoon his liberty of choice.\n\n\"Why do they call you the Eye of Zeitoon?\" I asked, when time enough\nhad elapsed to preclude his imagining that we regarded him seriously.\nOne has to be careful about beginnings in the Near East, even as elsewhere.\n\n\"I keep watch!\" he answered proudly, but also with a deeply-grounded\nconsciousness of cunning.  There were moments when I felt such strong\nrepugnance for the man that I itched to open the door and thrust him\nthrough--other moments when compassion for him urged me to offer\nmoney--food--influence--anything.  The second emotion fought all\nthe while against the first, and I found out afterward it had been\nthe same with Will.\n\n\"Why should Zeitoon need such special watching?\" I demanded.  \"How\ndo you watch?  Against whom?  Why?\"\n\nHe laughed with a pair of lawless eyes, and showed his yellow teeth.\n\n\"Ha!  Shall I speak of Zeitoon?  This, then:  the Turks never conquered\nit!  They came once and built a fort on the opposite mountain-side,\nwith guns to overawe us all.  We took their fort by storm!  We threw\ntheir cannon down a thousand feet into the bed of the torrent, and\nthere they lie to-day!  We took prisoner as many of their Arab zaptiehs\nas still were living--aye, they even brought Arabs against us--poor\nfools who had not yet heard of Zeitoon's defenders!  Then we came\ndown to the plains for a little vengeance, leaving the Arabs for\nour wives to guard.  They are women of spirit, the Zeitoonli wives!\n\n\"Word reached Zeitoon presently that we were being hard pressed on\nthe plains.  It was told to the Zeitoonli wives that they might arrange\nto have pursuit called off from us by surrendering those Arab prisoners.\nThey answered that Zeitoon-fashion.  How?  I will tell.  There is\na bridge of wood, flung over across the mountain torrent, five hundred\nfeet above the water, spanning from crag to crag.  Those Zeitoonli\nwives of ours bound the Arab prisoners hand and foot.  They brought\nthem out along the bridge.  They threw them over one at a time, each\nman looking on until his turn came.  That was the answer of the brave\nZeitoonli wives!\"\n\n\"And you on the plains?\"\n\n\"Ah!  It takes better than Osmanli to conquer the men of Zeitoon!\"\nhe gave the Turks their own names for themselves with the air of\na brave fighting man conceding his opponent points.  \"We heard what\nour wives had done.  We were encouraged.  We prevailed!  We fell\nback to-ward our mountain and prevailed!  There in Zeitoon we have\nweapons--numbers--advantage of position, for no roads come near Zeitoon\nthat an araba, or a gun, or anything on wheels can use.  The only\nthing we fear is treachery, leading to surprise in overwhelming force.\nAnd against these I keep watch!\"\n\n\"Why should you tell us all this?\" demanded Will.\n\n\"How do you know we are not agents of the Turkish government?\"\n\nHe laughed outright, throwing out both hands toward us.  \"Eenglis\nsportmen!\" he said simply.\n\n\"What's that got to do with it?\" Will retorted.  He has the unaccountable\nAmerican dislike of being mistaken for an Englishman, but long ago\ngave up arguing the point, since foreigners refuse, as a rule, to\nsee the sacred difference.\n\n\"I am, too, sportman.  At Zeitoon there is very good sport.  Bear.\nAntelope.  Wild boar.  One sportman to another--do you understand?\"\n\nWe did, and did not believe.\n\n\"How far to Zeitoon?\" I demanded.\n\n\"I go in five days when I hurry.  You--not hurrying--by\nhorse--seven--eight--nine days, depending on the roads.\"\n\n\"Are they all Armenians in Zeitoon?\"\n\n\"Most.  Not all.  There are Arabs--Syrians--Persians--a few\nCircassians--even Kurds and a Turk or two.  Our numbers have been\nreenforced continually by deserters from the Turkish Army.  Ninety-five\nper cent., however, are Armenians,\" he added with half-closed eyes,\nsuddenly suggesting that masked meekness that disguises most outrageous\nracial pride.\n\n\"It is common report,\" I said, \"that the Turks settled all Armenian\nproblems long ago by process of massacre until you have no spirit\nfor revolt left.\"\n\n\"The report lies, that is all!\" he answered.  Then suddenly he beat\non his chest with clenched fist.  \"There is spirit here!  There is\nspirit in Zeitoon!  No Osmanli dare molest my people!  Come to Zeitoon\nto shoot bear, boar, antelope!  I will show you!  I will prove my words!\"\n\n\"Were those six jingaan in the common room your men?\" I asked him,\nand he laughed as suddenly as he had stormed, like a teacher at a\nchild's mistake.\n\n\"Jingaan is a bad word,\" he said. \"I might kill a man who named me\nthat--depending on the man.  My brother I would kill for it--a stranger\nperhaps not.  Those men are Zingarri, who detest to sleep between\nbrick walls.  They have a tent pitched in the yard.\"\n\n\"Are they your men?\"\n\n\"Zingarri are no man's men.\"\n\nThe denial carried no conviction.\n\n\"Is there nothing but hunting at Zeitoon?\" Will demanded.\n\n\"Is that not much?  In addition the place itself is wonderful--a\nmountain in a mist, with houses clinging to the flanks of it, and\nscenery to burst the heart!\"\n\n\"What else?\" I asked.  \"No ancient buildings?\"\n\nHe changed his tactics instantly.\n\n\"Effendi,\" he said, leaning forward and pointing a forefinger at\nme by way of emphasis, \"there are castles on the mountains near Zeitoon\nthat have never been explored since the Turks--may God destroy\nthem!--overran the land!  Castles hidden among trees where only bears\ndwell! Castles built by the\nSeljuks--Armenians--Romans--Saracens--Crusaders! I know the way to\nevery one of them!\"\n\n\"What else?\" demanded Will, purposely incredulous.\n\n\"Beyond Zeitoon to north and west are cave-dwellers.  Mountains so\nhollowed out that only a shell remains, a sponge--a honeycomb!  No\nman knows how far those tunnels run!  The Turks have attempted now\nand then to smoke out the inhabitants.  They were laughed at!  One\nmountain is connected with another, and the tunnels run for miles\nand miles!\"\n\n\"I've seen cave-dwellings in the States,\" Will answered, unimpressed.\n\"But just where do you come in?\"\n\n\"I do not understand.\"\n\n\"What do you propose to get out of it?\"\n\n\"Nothing!  I am proud of my country.  I am sportman.  I am pleased\nto show.\"\n\nWe both jeered at him, for that explanation was too outrageously\nridiculous.  Armenians love money, whatever else they do or leave\nundone, and can wring a handsome profit out of business whose very\nexistence the easier-going Turk would not suspect.\n\n\"See if I can't read your mind,\" said Will.  \"You'll guide us for\nsome distance out of town, at a place you know, and your jingaan-gipsy\nbrethren will hold us up at some point and rob us to a fare-you-well.\nIs that the pretty scheme?\"\n\nSome men would have flown into a fury.  Some would have laughed the\nmatter off.  Any and every crook would have been at pains to hide\nhis real feelings.  Yet this strange individual was at a loss how\nto answer, and not averse to our knowing that.\n\nFor a moment a sort of low cunning seemed to creep over his mind,\nbut he dismissed it.  Three times he raised his hands, palms upward,\nand checked himself in the middle of a word.\n\n\"You could pay me for my services,\" he said at last, not as if that\nwere the real reason, nor as if he hoped to convince us that it was,\nbut as if he were offering an excuse that we might care to accept\nfor the sake of making peace with our own compunctions.\n\n\"There are four in our party,\" said Will, apropos apparently of nothing.\nThe effect was unexpected.\n\n\"Four?\"  His eyes opened wide, and he made the knuckle-bones of both\nhands crack like caps going off.  \"Four Eenglis sportman?\"\n\n\"I said four.  If you're willing to tell the naked truth about what's\nback of your offer, I'll undertake to talk it over with my other\nfriends.  Then, either we'll all four agree to take you up, or we'll\ngive you a flat refusal within a day or two.  Now--suit yourself.\"\n\n\"I have told the truth--Zeitoon--caves--boar--antelope--wild boar.\nI am a very good guide.  You shall pay me handsomely.\"\n\n\"Sure, we'll ante up like foreigners.  But why do you make the proposal?\nWhat's behind it?\"\n\n\"I never saw you until this afternoon.  You are Eenglis sportmen.\nI can show good sport.  You shall pay me.  Could it be simpler?\"\n\nIt seemed to me we had been within an ace of discovery, but the man's\nmind had closed again against us in obedience to some racial or religious\ninstinct outside our comprehension.  He had been on the verge of\ntaking us into confidence.\n\n\"Let the sportmen think it over,\" he said, getting up.  \"Jannam!\n(My soul!)  Effendi, when I was a younger man none could have made\nme half such a sportmanlike proposal without an answer on the instant!\nA man fit to strike the highway with his foot should be a judge of\nmen!  I have judged you fit to be invited!  Now you judge me--the\nEye of Zeitoon!\"\n\n\"What is your real name?\"\n\n\"I have none--or many, which is the same thing!  I did not ask your\nnames;  they are your own affair!\"\n\nHe stood with his hand on the door, not irresolute, but taking one\nlast look at us and our belongings.\n\n\"I wish you comfortable sleep, and long lives, effendim!\" he said\nthen, and swung himself out, closing the door behind him with an\nair of having honored us, not we him particularly.  And after he\nhad gone we were not at all sure that summary of the situation was\nnot right.\n\nWe lay awake on our cots until long after midnight, hazarding guesses\nabout him.  Whatever else he had done he had thoroughly aroused our\ncuriosity.\n\n\"If you want my opinion that's all he was after anyway!\" said Will,\ndropping his last cigarette-end on the floor and flattening it with\nhis slipper.\n\n\"Cut the cackle, and let's sleep!\"\n\nWe fell asleep at last amid the noise of wild carousing;  for the\nproprietor of the Yeni Khan, although a Turk, and therefore himself\npresumably abstemious, was not above dispensing at a price mastika\nthat the Greeks get drunk on, and the viler raki, with which Georgians,\nCircassians, Albanians, and even the less religious Turks woo imagination\nor forgetfulness.\n\nThere was knife-fighting as well as carousal before dawn, to judge\nby the cat-and-dog-fight swearing in and out among the camel pickets\nand the wheels of arabas.  But that was the business of the men who\nfought, and no one interfered.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Two\n\"How did sunshine get into the garden?  By whose leave came the wind?\"\n\n\nA TIME AND TIMES AND HALF A TIME\n\nWhen Cydnus bore the Taurus snows\nTo sweeten Cleopatra's keels,\nAnd rippled in the breeze that sings\nFrom Kara Dagh, where leafy wings\nOf flowers fall and gloaming steals\nThe colors of the blowing rose,\nOld were the wharves and woods and ways--\nOlder the tale of steel and fire,\nInvolved intrigue, envenomed plan,\nMan marketing his brother man\nBy dread duress to glut desire.\nNo peace was in those olden days.\nHope like the gorgeous rose sun-warmed\nBlossomed and blew away and died,\nTill gentleness had ceased to be\nAnd Tarsus knew no chivalry\nCould live an hour by Cydnus' side\nWhere all the heirs of evil swarmed.\nAnd yet--with every swelling spring\nEach pollen-scented zephyr's breath\nRepeats the patient news to ears\nMade dull by dreams of loveless years,\n\"It is of life, and not of death\nThat ye shall hear the Cydnus sing!\"\n\n\nWe awoke amid sounds unexplainable.  Most of the Moslems had finished\ntheir noisy ritual ablutions, and at dawn we had been dimly conscious\nof the strings of camels, mules and donkeys jingling out under the\narch beneath us.  Yet there was a great din from the courtyard of\nwild hoofs thumping on the dung, and of scurrying feet as if a mile-long\ncaravan were practising formations.\n\nSo we went out to yawn, and remained, oblivious of everything but\nthe cause of all the noise, we leaning with elbows on the wooden\nrail, and she laughing up at us at intervals.\n\nThe six Zingarri, or gipsies, had pitched their tent in the very\nmiddle of the yard, ambitious above all other considerations to keep\naway from walls.  It was a big, low, black affair supported on short\npoles, and subdivided by them into several compartments.  One could\nsee unshapely bulges where women did the housekeeping within.\n\nBut the woman who held us spell-bound cared nothing for Turkish\ncustom--a girl not more than seventeen years old at the boldest guess.\nShe was breaking a gray stallion in the yard, sitting the frenzied\nbeast without a saddle and doing whatever she liked with him, except\nthat his heels made free of the air, and he went from point to point\nwhichever end up best pleased his fancy.\n\nTravelers make an early start in Asia Minor, but the yard was by\nno means empty yet;  some folk were still waiting on the doubtful\nweather.  Her own people kept to the tent.  Whoever else had business\nin the yard made common cause and cursed the girl for making the\ndisturbance, frightening camels, horses, asses and themselves.  And\nshe ignored them all, unless it was on purpose that she brought her\nstallion's heels too close for safety to the most abusive.\n\nIt was only for us two that she had any kind of friendly interest;\nshe kept looking up at us and laughing as she caught our eyes, bringing\nher mount uprearing just beneath us several times.  She was pretty\nas the peep o' morning, with long, black wavy hair all loose about\nher shoulders, and as light on the horse as the foam he tossed about,\nalthough master of him without a second's doubt of it.\n\nWhen she had had enough of riding--long before we were tired of the\nspectacle--she shouted with a voice like a mellow bell.  One of the\ngipsies ran out and led away the sweating stallion, and she disappeared\ninto the tent throwing us a laugh over her shoulder.\n\n\"D'you suppose those gipsies are really of that Armenian's party?\"\nWill wondered aloud.  \"Now, if she were going to Zeitoon--!\"\n\nFeeling as he did, I mocked at him to hide my feelings, and we hung\nabout for another hour in hope of seeing her again, but she kept close.\nI don't doubt she watched us through a hole in the tent.  We would\nhave sat there alert in our chairs until evening only Fred sent a\nnote down to say he was well enough to leave the hospital.\n\nWe found him with his beard trimmed neatly and his fevered eyes all\nbright again, sitting talking to the nurse on the veranda about a\nniece of hers--Gloria Vanderman.\n\n\"Chicken in this desert!\" Will wondered irreverently, and Fred, who\nlikes his English to have dictionary meanings, rose from his chair\nin wrath.  The nurse made that the cue for getting rid of us.\n\n\"Take Mr. Oakes away!\" she urged, laughing.  \"He threatened to kill\na man this morning.  There's too much murder in Tarsus now.  If he\nshould add to it--\"\n\n\"You know it wasn't on my account,\" Fred objected.  \"It was what\nhe wrote--and said of you.  Why, he has had you prayed for publicly\nby name, and you washing the brute's feet!  Let me back in there\nfor just five minutes, and I'll show what a hospital case should\nreally look like!\"\n\n\"Take him away!\" she laughed.  \"Isn't it bad enough to be prayed\nfor?  Must I get into the papers, too, as heroine of a scandal?\"\n\nThe head missionary was not there to say good-by to, life in his\ncase being too serious an affair to waste minutes of a precious morning\non farewells, so we packed Fred into the waiting carriage and drove\nall the way to Mersina, where we interrupted Monty's mid-afternoon\ngame of chess.\n\nFred Oakes and Monty were the closest friends I ever met--one problem\nfor an enemy--one stout, two-headed, most dependable ally for the\nlucky man or woman they called friend.\n\n\"Oh, hullo!\" said Monty over his shoulder, as our names were called\nout by the stately consular kavass.\n\n\"Hullo!\" said Fred, and shook hands with the consul.\n\n\"Thought you were due to be sick for another week?\" said Monty, closing\nup the board.\n\n\"I was.  I would have been.  Bed would have done me good, and the\nnurse is a darling, old enough to be Will's mother.  But they put\na biped by the name of Peter Measel in the bed next mine.  He's a\nmissionary on his own account, and keeps a diary.  Seems be contributes\nto the funds of a Welsh mission in France, and they do what he says.\nHe has all the people he disapproves of prayed for publicly by name\nin the mission hall in Marseilles, with extracts out of his diary\nby way of explanation, so that the people who pray may know what\nthey've got on their hands.  The special information I gave him about\nyou, Monty, will make Marseilles burn!  He's got you down as a drunken\npirate, my boy, with no less than eleven wives.  But he asked me\none night whether I thought what he'd written about the nurse was\nstrong enough, and he read it aloud to me.  You'd never believe what\nthe reptile had dared suggest in his devil's log-book!  I'm expelled\nfor threatening to kill him!\"\n\n\"The nurse was right,\" said the consul gloomily.  \"There'll be murder\nenough hereabouts--and soon!\"\n\nHe was a fairly young man yet in spite of the nearly white hair over\nthe temples.  He measured his words in the manner of a man whose\nspeech is taken at face value.\n\n\"The missionaries know.  The governments won't listen.  I've been\nappealed to.  So has the United States consul, and neither of us\nis going to be able to do much.  Remember, I represent a government\nat peace with Turkey, and so does he.  The Turk has a side to his\ncharacter that governments ignore.  Have you watched them at prayer?\"\n\nWe told him how close we had been on the previous night, and he laughed.\n\n\"Did you suppose I couldn't smell camel and khan the moment you came\nin?\"\n\n\"That was why Sister Vanderman hurried you off so promptly!\" Fred\nannounced with an air of outraged truthfulness.  \"Faugh!  Slangy\ntalk and stink of stables!\"\n\n\"I was talking of Turks,\" said the consul.  \"When they pray, you\nmay have noticed that they glance to right and left.  When they think\nthere is nobody looking they do more, they stare deliberately to\nthe right and left.  That is the act of recognition of the angel\nand the devil who are supposed to attend every Moslem, the angel\nto record his good deeds and the devil his bad ones.  To my mind\nthere lies the secret of the Turk's character.  Most of the time\nhe's a man of his word--honest--courteous--considerate--good-humored--even\nchivalrous--living up to the angel.  But once in so often\nhe remembers the other shoulder, and then there isn't any limit to\nthe deviltry he'll do.  Absolutely not a limit!\"\n\n\"I suppose we or the Americans could land marines at a pinch, and\nprotect whoever asked for protection?\" suggested Monty.\n\n\"No,\" said the consul deliberately.  \"Germany would object.  Germany\nis the only power that would.  Germany would accuse us of scheming\nto destroy the value of their blessed Baghdad railway.\"\n\nA privy councilor of England, which Monty was, is not necessarily\nin touch with politics of any sort.  Neither were we;  but it happened\nthat more than once in our wanderings about the world things had been\nforced on our attention.\n\n\"They would rather see Europe burn from end to end!\" Monty agreed.\n\n\"And I think there's more than that in it,\" said the consul.  \"Armenians\nare not their favorites.  The Germans want the trade of the Levant.\nThe Armenians are business men.  They're shrewder than Jews and more\ndependable than Greeks.  It would suit Germany very nicely, I imagine,\nto have no Armenians to compete with.\"\n\n\"But if Germany once got control of the Near East,\" I objected, \"she\ncould impose her own restrictions.\"\n\nThe consul frowned.  \"Armenians who thrive in spite of Turks--\"\n\n\"Would skin a German for hide and tallow,\" nodded Will.\n\n\"Exactly.  Germany would object vigorously if we or the States should\nland marines to prevent the Turks from applying the favorite remedy,\nvukuart--that means events, you know--their euphemism for massacre\nat rather frequent intervals.  Germany would rather see the Turks\nfinish the dirty work thoroughly than have it to do herself later on.\"\n\n\"You mean,\" said I, \"that the German government is inciting to massacre?\"\n\n\"Hardly.  There are German missionaries in the country, doing good\nwork in a funny, fussy, rigorous fashion of their own.  They'd raise\na dickens of a hocus-pocus back in Germany if they once suspected\ntheir government of playing that game.  No.  But Germany intends\nto stand off the other powers, while Turks tackle the Armenians;\nand the Turks know that.\"\n\n\"But what's the immediate excuse for massacre?\" demanded Fred.\n\nThe consul laughed.\n\n\"All that's needed is a spark.  The Armenians haven't been tactful.\nThey don't hesitate to irritate the Turks--not that you can blame\nthem, but it isn't wise.  Most of the money-lenders are Armenians;\nTurks won't engage in that business themselves on religious grounds,\nbut they're ready borrowers, and the Armenian money-lenders, who\nare in a very small minority, of course, are grasping and give a\nbad name to the whole nation.  Then, Armenians have been boasting\nopenly that one of these days the old Armenian kingdom will be\nreestablished.  The Turks are conquerors, you know, and don't like\nthat kind of talk.  If the Armenians could only keep from quarreling\namong themselves they could win their independence in half a jiffy,\nbut the Turks are deadly wise at the old trick of divide et impera;\nthey keep the Armenians quarreling, and nobody dares stand in with\nthem because sooner--or later--sooner, probably--they'll split among\nthemselves, and leave their friends high and dry.  You can't blame 'em.\nThe Turks know enough to play on their religious prejudices and set\none sect against another.  When the massacres begin scarcely an Armenian\nwill know who is friend and who enemy.\"\n\n\"D'you mean to say,\" demanded Fred, \"that they're going to be shot\nlike bottles off a wall without rhyme or reason?\"\n\n\"That's how it was before,\" said the consul.  \"There's nothing to\nstop it.  The world is mistaken about Armenians.  They're a hot-blooded\nlot on the whole, with a deep sense of national pride, and a hatred\nof Turkish oppression that rankles.  One of these mornings a Turk\nwill choose his Armenian and carefully insult the man's wife or daughter.\nPerhaps he will crown it by throwing dirt in the fellow's face.\nThe Armenian will kill him or try to, and there you are.  Moslem\nblood shed by a dog of a giaour--the old excuse!\"\n\n\"Don't the Armenians know what's in store for them?\" I asked.\n\n\"Some of them know.  Some guess.  Some are like the villagers on\nMount Vesuvius--much as we English were in '57 in India, I\nimagine--asleep--playing games--getting rich on top of a volcano.\nThe difference is that the Armenians will have no chance.\"\n\n\"Did you ever hear tell of the Eye of Zeitoon?\" asked Will, apropos\napparently of nothing.\n\n\"No,\" said the consul, staring at him.\n\nWill told him of the individual we had talked with in the khan the\nnight before, describing him rather carefully, not forgetting the\ngipsies in the black tent, and particularly not the daughter of the\ndawn who schooled a gray stallion in the courtyard.\n\nThe consul shook his head.\n\n\"Never saw or heard of any of them.\"\n\nWe were sitting in full view of the roadstead where Anthony and\nCleopatra's ships had moored a hundred times.  The consul's garden\nsloped in front of us, and most of the flowers that Europe reckons\nrare were getting ready to bloom.\n\n\"Would you know the man if you saw him again, Will?\" I asked.\n\n\"Sure I would!\"\n\n\"Then look!\"\n\nI pointed, and seeing himself observed a man stepped out of the shadow\nof some oleanders.  There was something suggestive in his choice\nof lurking place, for every part of the oleander plant is dangerously\npoisonous;  it was as if he had hidden himself among the hairs of death.\n\n\"Him, sure enough!\" said Will.\n\nThe man came forward uninvited.\n\n\"How did you get into the grounds?\" the consul demanded, and the\nman laughed, laying an unafraid hand on the veranda rail.\n\n\"My teskere is a better than the Turks give!\" he answered in English.\n(A teskere is the official permit to travel into the interior.)\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"How did sunshine come into the garden?  By whose leave came the wind?\"\n\nHe stood on no formality.  Before one of us could interfere (for\nhe might have been plying the assassin's trade) he had vaulted the\nveranda rail and stood in front of us.  As he jumped I heard the\nrattle of loose cartridges, and the thump of a hidden pistol against\nthe woodwork.  I could see the hilt of a dagger, too, just emerging\nfrom concealment through the opening in his smock.  But he stood\nin front of us almost meekly, waiting to be spoken to.\n\n\"You are without shame!\" said the consul.\n\n\"Truly!  Of what should I be ashamed!\"\n\n\"What brought you here?\"\n\n\"Two feet and a great good will!  You know me.\"\n\nThe consul shook his head.\n\n\"Who sold the horse to the German from Bitlis?\"\n\n\"Are you that man?\"\n\n\"Who clipped the wings of a kite, and sold it for ten pounds to a\nfool for an eagle from Ararat?\"\n\nThe consul laughed.\n\n\"Are you the rascal who did that?\"\n\n\"Who threw Olim Pasha into the river, and pushed him in and in again\nfor more than an hour with a fishing pole--and then threw in the\ngendarmes who ran to arrest him--and only ran when the Eenglis consul\ncame?\"\n\n\"I remember,\" said the consul.\n\n\"Yet you don't look quite like that man.\"\n\n\"I told you you knew me.\"\n\n\"Neither does to-day's wind blow like yesterday's!\"\n\n\"What is your name?\"\n\n\"Then it was Ali.\"\n\n\"What is it now?\"\n\n\"The name God gave me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"God knows!\"\n\n\"What do you want here?\"\n\nHe spread out his arms toward us four, and grinned.\n\n\"Look--see!  Four Eenglis sportman!  Could a man want more?\"\n\n\"Your face is hauntingly familiar,\" said the consul, searching old\nmemories.\n\n\"No doubt.  Who carried your honor's letter to Adrianople in time\nof war, and received a bullet, but brought the answer back?\"\n\n\"What--are you that man--Kagig?\"\n\nInstead of replying the man opened his smock, and pulled aside an\nundershirt until his hairy left breast lay bare down to where the\nnipple should have been.  Why a bullet that drilled that nipple so\nneatly had not pierced the heart was simply mystery.\n\n\"Kagig, by jove!  Kagig with a beard!  Nobody would know you but\nfor that scar.\"\n\n\"But now you know me surely?  Tell these Eenglis sportman, then,\nthat I am good man--good guide!  Tell them they come with me to Zeitoon!\"\n\nThe consul's face darkened swiftly, clouded by some notion that he\nseemed to try to dismiss, but that refused to leave him.\n\n\"How much would you ask for your services?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Whatever the effendim please.\"\n\n\"Have you a horse?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"You and your horse, then, two piasters a day, and you feed yourself\nand the beast.\"\n\nThe man agreed, very bright-eyed.  Often it takes a day or two to\ncome to terms with natives of that country, yet the terms the consul\noffered him were those for a man of very ordinary attainments.\n\n\"Come back in an hour,\" said the consul.\n\nWithout a word of answer Kagig vaulted back across the rail and\ndisappeared around the corner of the house, walking without hurry\nbut not looking back.\n\n\"Kagig, by jove!  It would take too long now to tell that story of\nthe letter to Adrianople.  I've no proof, but a private notion that\nKagig is descended from the old Armenian kings.  In a certain sort\nof tight place there's not a better man in Asia.  Now, Lord Montdidier,\nif you're in earnest about searching for that castle of your Crusader\nancestors, you're in luck!\"\n\n\"You know it's what I came here for,\" said Monty.  \"These friends\nof mine are curious, and I'm determined.  Now that Fred's well--\"\n\n\"I'm puzzled,\" said the consul, leaning back and looking at us all\nwith half-closed eyes.  \"Why should Kagig choose just this time to\nguide a hunting party?  If any man knows trouble's brewing, I suspect\nbe surely does.  Anything can happen in the interior.  I recall,\nfor instance, a couple of Danes, who went with a guide not long ago,\nand simply disappeared.  There are outlaws everywhere, and it's more\nthan a theory that the public officials are in league with them.\"\n\n\"What a joke if we find the old family castle is a nest of robbers,\"\nsmiled Monty.\n\n\"Still!\" corrected Fred.\n\nI was watching the consul's eyes.  He was troubled, but the prospect\nof massacre did not account for all of his expression.  There was\ndebate, inspiration against conviction, being fought out under cover\nof forced calm.  Inspiration won the day.\n\n\"I was wondering,\" he said, and lit a fresh cigar while we waited\nfor him to go on.\n\n\"I vouch for my friends,\" said Monty.\n\n\"It wasn't that.  I've no right to make the proposal--no official\nright whatever--I'm speaking strictly unofficially--in fact, it's\nnot a proposal at all--merely a notion.\"\n\nHe paused to give himself a last chance, but indiscretion was too\nstrong.\n\n\"I was wondering how far you four men would go to save twenty or\nthirty thousand lives.\"\n\n\"You've no call to wonder about that,\" said Will.\n\n\"Suppose you tell us what you've got in mind,\" suggested Monty, putting\nhis long legs on a chair and producing a cigarette.\n\nThe consul knocked out his pipe and sat forward, beginning to talk\na little faster, as a man who throws discretion to the winds.\n\n\"I've no legal right to interfere.  None at all.  In case of a massacre\nof Armenians--men, women, little children--I could do nothing.  Make\na fuss, of course.  Throw open the consulate to refugees.  Threaten\na lot of things that I know perfectly well my government won't do.\nThe Turks will be polite to my face and laugh behind my back, knowing\nI'm helpless.  But if you four men--\"\n\n\"Yes--go on--what?\"\n\n\"Spill it!\" urged Will.\n\n\"--should be up-country, and I knew it for a fact, but did not know\nyour precise whereabouts, I'd have a grown excuse for raising most\nparticular old Harry!  You get my meaning?\"\n\n\"Sure!\" said Will. \"Monty's an earl.  Fred's related to half the\npeerages in Burke.  Me and him\"--I was balancing my chair on one\nleg and he pushed me over backward by way of identification--\"just\npose as distinguished members of society for the occasion.  I get you.\"\n\n\"It might even be possible, Mr. Yerkes, to get the United States\nCongress to take action on your account.\"\n\n\"Don't you believe it!\" laughed Will.  \"The members for the Parish\nPump, and the senators from Ireland would howl about the Monroe Doctrine\nand Washington's advice at the merest hint of a Yankee in trouble\nin foreign parts.\"\n\n\"What about the United States papers?\"\n\n\"They'd think it was an English scheme to entangle the United States,\nand they'd be afraid to support action for fear of the Irish.  No,\nEngland's your only chance!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the consul, \"I've told you the whole idea.  If I should\nhappen to know of four important individuals somewhere up-country,\nand massacres should break out after you had started, I could supply\nour ambassador with something good to work on.  The Turkish government\nmight have to stop the massacre in the district in which you should\nhappen to be.  That would save lives.\"\n\n\"But could they stop it, once started?\" I asked.\n\n\"They could try.  That 'ud be more than they ever did yet.\"\n\n\"You mean,\" said Monty, \"that you'd like us to engage Kagig and make\nthe trip, and to remain out in case of--ah--vukuart until we're rescued?\"\n\n\"Can't say I like it, but that's what I mean.  And as for rescue,\nthe longer the process takes the better, I imagine!\"\n\n\"Hide, and have them hunt for us, eh?\"\n\n\"Would it help,\" I suggested, \"if we were to be taken prisoner by\noutlaws and held for ransom?\"\n\n\"It might,\" said the consul darkly.  \"I'd take to the hills myself\nand send back a wail for help, only my plain duty is here at the\nmission.  What I have suggested to you is mad quixotism at the best,\nand at the worst--well, do you recall what happened to poor Vyner,\nwho was held for ransom by Greek brigands?  They sent a rescue party\ninstead of money, and--\"\n\n\"Charles Vyner was a friend of mine,\" said Monty quietly.\n\nFred began to look extremely cheerful and Will nudged me and nodded.\n\n\"Remember,\" said the consul, \"in the present state of European politics\nthere's no knowing what can or can't be done, but if you four men\nare absent in the hills I believe I can give the Turkish government\nso much to think about that there'll be no massacres in that one district.\"\n\n\"Whistle up Kagig!\" Monty answered, and that was the end of the argument\nas far as yea or nay had anything to do with it.  Prospect of danger\nwas the last thing likely to divide the party.\n\n\"How about permits to travel?\" asked Will.  \"The United States consul\ntold me none is to be had at present.\"\n\nThe consul rubbed his thumb and forefinger together.\n\n\"It may cost a little more, that's all,\" he said.  \"You might go\nwithout, but you'd better submit to extortion.\"\n\nHe called the kavass, the uniformed consular attendant, and sent\nhim in search of Kagig.  Within two minutes the Eye of Zeitoon was\ngrinning at us through a small square window in the wall at one end\nof the veranda.  Then he came round and once more vaulted the veranda\nrail, for he seemed to hold ordinary means of entry in contempt.\nHis eye looked very possessive for that of one seeking employment\nas a guide, but he stood at respectful attention until spoken to.\n\n\"These gentlemen have decided to employ you,\" the consul announced.\n\n\"Mashallah!\" (God be praised!)  For a Christian he used unusual expletives.\n\n\"They want to find a castle in the mountains, to hunt bear and boar,\nand to see Zeitoon.\"\n\n\"I shall lead them to ten castles never seen before by Eenglismen!\nThey shall kill all the bears and pigs!  Never was such sport as\nthey shall see!\"\n\nHe exploded the word pigs as if he had the Osmanli prejudice against\nthat animal.  Yet he wore a pig-skin cartridge belt about his middle.\n\n\"They will need enormous lots of ammunition!\" he announced.\n\n\"What else would the roadside robbers like them to bring?\"\n\n\"No Turkish servants!  They throw Turks over a bridge-side in Zeitoon!\nI myself will provide servants, who shall bring them back safely!\"\n\nIt seemed to me that he breathed inward as he said that.  A Turk\nwould have added \"Inshallah!\"--if God wills!\n\n\"Make ready for a journey of two months,\" he said.\n\n\"When and where shall the start be?\"\n\nIt would obviously be unwise to start from the consulate.\n\n\"From the Yeni Khan in Tarsus,\" said Will.\n\n\"That is very good--that is excellent!  I will send Zeitoonli servants\nto the Yeni Khan at once.  Pay them the right price.  Have you horses?\nCamels are of no use, nor yet are wheels--you shall know why later!\nMules are best.\"\n\n\"I know where you can hire mules,\" said the consul, \"with a Turkish\nmuleteer to each pair.\"\n\n\"Oh, well!\" laughed Kagig, leaning back against the rail and moving\nhis hands palms upward as if he weighed one thought against another.\n\"What is the difference?  If a few Turks move or less come to an\nend over Zeitoon bridge--\"\n\nIt was only for moments at a time that he seemed able to force himself\nto speak as our inferior.  A Turk of the guide class would likely\nhave knelt and placed a foot of each of us on his neck in turn as\nsoon as he knew we had engaged him.  This Armenian seemed made of\nother stuff.\n\n\"Then be on hand to-morrow morning,\" ordered Monty.\n\nBut the Eye of Zeitoon had another surprise for us.\n\n\"I shall meet you on the road,\" he announced with an air of a social\nequal.  \"Servants shall attend you at the Yeni Khan.  They will say\nnothing at all, and work splendidly!  Start when you like;  you will\nfind me waiting for you at a good place on the road.  Bring not plenty,\nbut too much ammunition!  Good day, then, gentlemen!\"\n\nHe nodded to us--bowed to the consul--vaulted the rail.  A second\nlater he grinned at us again through the tiny window.  \"I am the\nEye of Zeitoon!\" he boasted, and was gone.  A servant whom the consul\nsent to follow him came back after ten or fifteen minutes saying\nhe had lost him in a maze of narrow streets.\n\nHis latter, offhanded manner scarcely auguring well, we debated whether\nor not to search for some one more likely amenable to discipline\nto take his place.  But the consul spent an hour telling us about\nthe letter that went to Adrianople, and the bringing back of the\nanswer that hastened peace.\n\n\"He was shot badly.  He nearly died on the way back.  I've no idea\nhow he recovered.  He wouldn't accept a piaster more than the price\nagreed on.\"\n\n\"Let's take a chance!\" said Will, and we were all agreed before he\nurged it.\n\n\"There's one other thing,\" said the consul.  \"I've been told a Miss\nGloria Vanderrnan is on her way to the mission at Marash--\"\n\n\"Gee whiz!\" said Will.\n\nThe consul nodded.  \"She's pretty, if that's what you mean.  It was\nvery unwise to let her go, escorted only by Armenians.  Of course,\nshe may get through without as much as suspecting trouble's brewing,\nbut--well--I wish you'd look out for her.\"\n\n\"Chicken, eh?\"\n\nWill stuck both hands deep in his trousers pockets and tilted his\nchair backward to the point of perfect poise.\n\n\"Cuckoo, you ass!\" laughed Fred, kicking the chair over backward,\nand then piling all the veranda furniture on top, to the scandalized\namazement of the stately kavass, who came at that moment shepherding\na small boy with a large tray and perfectly enormous drinks.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Three\n\"Sahib, there is always--work for real soldiers!\"\n\n\nWHERE TWO OR THREE\n\nOh, all the world is sick with hate,\nAnd who shall heal it, friend o' mine?\nAnd who is friend? And who shall stand\nSince hireling tongue and alien hand\nKill nobleness in all this land?\nJudas and Pharisee combine\nTo plunder and proclaim it Fate.\n\nDays when the upright dared be few\nAre they departed, friend o' mine?\nAre bribery and rich largesse\nFair props for fat forgetfulness,\nOr anodynous of distress?\nOh, would the world were drunk with wine\nAnd not this last besotting brew!\n\nOh, for the wonderful again--\nThe greatly daring, friend o' mine!\nThe simply gallant blade unbought,\nThe soul compassionate, unsought,\nWith no price but the priceless thought\nNor purpose than the brave design\nOf giving that the world may gain!\n\n\nSo we took two rooms at the Yeni Khan instead of one, not being minded\nto sleep as closely as the gentry of Asia Minor like to.  Will hurried\nus down there for a look at the gipsy girl.  But the tent was gone\nand the gipsies with it, and when we asked questions about them people\nspat.\n\nYour good Moslem--and a Moslem is good in those parts who makes a\nmountain of observances, regarding mole-hills of mere morals not\nat all--affects to despise all giaours; but a giaour, like a gipsy,\nwho has no obvious religion of any kind, he ranks below the pig in\norder of reverence.  It did not redound to our credit that we showed\ninterest in the movements of such people.\n\nMonty brought an enormous can of bug-powder with him, and restored\nour popularity by lending generously after he had treated our quarters\nsufficiently for three days' stay.  Fred did nothing to our\nquarters--stirred no finger, claiming convalescence with his tongue in\nhis cheek, and strolling about until he fell utterly in love with the\nkhan and its crowd, and the khan with him.\n\nThat very first night he brought out his concertina on the balcony,\nand yowled songs to its clamor;  and whether or not the various crowd\nagreed on naming the noise music, all were delighted with the friendliness.\n\nFred talks more languages fluently than he can count on the fingers\nof both hands.  He began to tell tales in a sing-song eastern snarl--a\ntale in Persian, then in Turkish, and the night grew breathless,\nfull of listening, until pent-up interest at intervals burst bonds\nand there were \"Ahs\" and \"Ohs\" all amid the dark, like little breaths\nof night wind among trees.\n\nHe found small time for sleep, and when dawn came, and four Zeitoonli\nservants according to Kagig's promise, they still swarmed around\nhim begging for more.  He went off to eat breakfast with a khan from\nBokhara, sitting on a bale of nearly priceless carpets to drink overland\ntea made in a thing like a samovar.\n\nAll the rest of that day, and the next, sleeping only at intervals,\nwhile Monty and Will and I helped the Zeitoonli servants get our\nloads in shape, Fred sharpened his wonder-gift of tongues on the\nfascinated men of many nations, giving them London ditties and tales\nfrom the Thousand Nights and a Night in exchange for their news of\ncaravan routes.  He left them well pleased with their bargain.\n\nMonty went off alone the second day to see about mules.  The Turk\nwith a trade to make believes that of several partners one is always\n\"easier\" than the rest;  consequently, one man can bring him to see\nswifter reason than a number can.  He came back that evening with\ntwelve good mules and four attendants.\n\n\"One apiece to ride, and two apiece to carry everything.  Not another\nmule to be had.  Unpack the loads again and make them smaller!\"\n\nFred came and sat with us that night before the charcoal brazier\nin his and Monty's room.\n\n\"They all talk of robbers on the road,\" he said.  \"Northward, through\nthe Circassian Gates, or eastward it's all the same.  There's a man\nin a room across the way who was stripped stark naked and beaten\nbecause they thought he might have money in his clothes.  When he\nreached this place without a stitch on him he still had all his money\nin his clenched fists!  Quite a sportsman--what?  Imagine his juggling\nwith it while they whipped him with knotted cords!\"\n\n\"What have you heard about Kagig?\"\n\n\"Nothing.  But a lot about vukuart.*  It's vague, but there's something\nin the air.  You'll notice the Turkish muleteers are having nothing\nwhatever to say to our Zeitoonli, although they've accepted the same\nservice.  Moslems are keeping together, and Armenians are getting\nthe silence cure.  Armenians are even shy of speaking to one another.\nI've tried listening, and I've tried asking questions, although that\nwas risky.  I can't get a word of explanation.  I've noticed, though,\nthat the ugly mood is broadening.  They've been polite to me, but\nI've heard the word shapkali applied more than once to you fellows.\nMeans hatted man, you know.  Not a serious insult, but implies contempt.\"\n\n--------------\n* Turkish word:  happenings, a euphemism for massacre.\n--------------\n\nNothing but comfort and respectability ever seemed able to make Fred\ngloomy.  He discussed our present prospects with the air of an epicure\nordering dinner.  And Monty listened with his dark, delightful\nsmile--the kindliest smile in all the world.  I have seen unthoughtful\nmen mistake it for a sign of weakness.\n\nI have never known him to argue.  Nor did he then, but strode straight\ndown into the khan yard, we sitting on the balcony to watch.  He\nvisited our string of mules first for an excuse, and invited a Kurdish\nchieftain (all Kurds are chieftains away from home) to inspect a\nswollen fetlock.  With that subtle flattery he unlocked the man's\nreserve, passed on from chance remark to frank, good-humored questions,\nand within an hour had talked with twenty men.  At last he called\nto one of the Zeitoonli to come and scrape the yard dung from his\nboots, climbed the stairs leisurely, and sat beside us.\n\n\"You're quite right, Fred,\" he said quietly.\n\nThen there came suddenly from out the darkness a yell for help in\nEnglish that brought three of us to our feet.  Fred brushed his fierce\nmustaches upward with an air of satisfaction, and sat still.\n\n\"There's somebody down there quite wrong, and in line at last to\nfind out why!\" he said.  \"I've been waiting for this.  Sit down.\"\n\nWe obeyed him, though the yells continued.  There came blows suggestive\nof a woman on the housetops beating carpets.\n\n\"D'you recollect the man I mentioned at the consulate--the biped\nPeter Measel, missionary on his own account, who keeps a diary and\nlibels ladies in it?  Well, he's foul of a thalukdar* from Rajputana,\nand of a Prussian contractor, recruiting men for work on the Baghdad\nrailway.  I wasn't allowed to murder him.  I see why now--finger\nof justice--I'd have been too quick.  Sit down, you idiots!  You've\nno idea what he wrote about Miss Vanderman.  Let him scream, I like it!\"\n\n---------------\n* Punjabi Word--landholder.\n---------------\n\n\"Come along,\" said Monty.  \"If he were a bad-house keeper he has\nhad enough!\"\n\nBut Will had gone before us, headlong down the stairs with the speed\noff the mark that they taught him on the playing field at Bowdoin.\nWhen we caught up he was standing astride a prostrate being who sobbed\nlike a cow with its throat cut, and a Rajput and a German, either\nof them six feet tall, were considering whether or not to resent\nthe violence of his interference.  The German was disposed to yield\nto numbers.  The Rajput not so.\n\n\"Why are you beating him?\" asked Monty.\n\n\"Gott in Hinimel, who would not!  He wrote of me in his diary--der\nLiminel!--that I shanghai laborers.\"\n\n\"Do you, or don't you?\" asked Monty sweetly.\n\n\"Kreutz-blitzen!  What is that to do with you--or with him?  What\nright had he to write that people in France should pray for me in church?\"\n\nThe Rajput all this while was standing simmering, as ready as a boar\nat bay to fight the lot of us, yet I thought with an air about him,\ntoo, of half-conscious surprise.  Several times he took a half-pace\nforward to assert his right of chastisement, looked hard at Monty,\nand checked mid-stride.\n\n\"You've done enough,\" said Monty.\n\n\"Who are you that says so?\" the German retorted.\n\n\"He--who--will--attend--to--it--that--you--do--no--more!\"  Monty's\nsmooth voce had become without inflection.\n\n\"Bah!  That is easy, isn't it?  You are four to one!\"\n\n\"Five to one!\"\n\nThe Rajput's gruff throat thrilled with a new emotion.  He sprang\nsuddenly past me, and thrust himself between Monty and the German,\nwho took advantage of the opportunity to walk away.\n\n\"Lord Montdidier, colonel sahib bahadur, burra salaam!\"\n\nHe made no obeisance, but stood facing Monty eye to eye.  The words,\nas be roiled them out, were like an order given to a thousand men.\nOne almost heard the swish of sabers as the squadrons came to the\ngeneral salute.\n\n\"I knew you, Rustum Khan, the minute I set eyes on you.  Why were\nyou beating this man?\"\n\n\"Sahib bahadur, because he wrote in his book that people in France\nshould pray for me in church, naming my honorable name, because,\nsays he--but I will not repeat what he says.  It is not seemly.\"\n\n\"How do you know what is in his diary?\" Monty asked.\n\n\"That German read it out to me.  We were sitting, he and I, discussing\nhow the Turks intend to butcher the Armenians, as all the world knows\nis written.  They say it shall happen soon.  Said he to me--the German\nsaid to me--'I know another,' said he, 'who if I had my way should\nsuffer first in that event.'  Saying which he showed the written\nbook that he had found, and read me parts of it.  The German was\nfor denouncing the fellow as a friend of Armenians, but I was for\nbeating him at once, and I had my way.\"\n\n\"Where is the book?\" demanded Monty.\n\n\"The German has it.\"\n\n\"The German has no right to it.\"\n\n\"I will bring it.\"\n\nRustum Khan strode off into the night, and Monty bent over the sobbing\nform of the self-appointed missionary.  We were all alone in the midst\nof the courtyard, not even watched from behind the wheels of arabas,\nfor a fight or a thrashing in the khans of Asia Minor is strictly\nthe affair of him who gets the worst of it.\n\n\"Will you burn that book of yours, Measel, if we protect you from\nfurther assault?\"\n\nThe man sobbed that he would do anything, but Monty held him to the\npoint, and at last procured a specific affirmative.  Then Rustum\nKhan came back with the offending tome.  It was bulky enough to contain\nan account of the sins of Asia Minor.\n\nFred and I picked the poor fellow up and led him to where the cooking\nplaces stood in one long row.  Will carried the book, and Rustum\nKhan stole wood from other folks' piles, and fanned a fire.  We watched\nthe unhappy Peter Measel put the book on the flames with his own hands.\n\n\"You're old enough to have known better than keep such a diary!\"\nsaid Monty, stirring the charred pages.\n\n\"I am at any rate a martyr!\" Measel answered.\n\nThe man could walk by that time--he was presumably abstemious and\nrecovered from shock quickly.  Monty sent me to see him to his room,\nwhich turned out to be next the German's, and until Will came over\nfrom our quarters with first-aid stuff from our chest I spent the\nminutes telling the German what should happen to him in case he should\nso far forget discretion as to resume the offensive.  He said nothing\nin reply, but sat in his doorway looking up at me with an expression\nintended to make me feel nervous of reprisals without committing him\nto deeds.\n\nLater, when we had done our best for \"the martyred biped Measel,\"\nas Fred described him, Will and I found Rustum Khan with Fred and\nMonty seated around the charcoal brazier in Monty's room, deep in\nthe valley of reminiscences.  Our entry rather broke the spell, but\nRustum Khan was not to be denied.\n\n\"You used to tell in those days, Colonel sahib bahadur,\" he said,\naddressing Monty with that full-measured compliment that the chivalrous,\nold East still cherishes, \"of a castle of your ancestors in these\nparts.  Do you remember, when I showed you the ruins of my family\nplace in Rajputana, how you stood beside me on the heights, sahib,\nand vowed some day to hunt for that Crusaders' nest, as you called it?\"\n\n\"That is the immediate purpose of this trip of ours,\" said Monty.\n\n\"Ah!\" said the Rajput, and was silent for about a minute.  Fred Oakes\nbegan to hum through his nose.  He has a ridiculous belief that doing\nthat throws keen inquirers off a scent.\n\n\"Colonel sahib, since I was a little butcha not as high as your knee\nI have spoken English and sat at the feet of British officers.  Little\nenough I know, but by the beard of God's prophet I know this:  when\na British colonel sahib speaks of 'immediate purposes,' there are\nhidden purposes of greater importance!\"\n\n\"That well may be,\" said Monty gravely.  \"I remember you always were\na student of significant details, Rustum Khan.\"\n\n\"There was a time when I was in your honor's confidence.\"\n\nMonty smiled.\n\n\"That was years ago.  What are you doing here, Rustum Khan?\"\n\n\"A fair enough question!  I hang my head.  As you know, sahib, I\nam a rangar.  My people were all Sikhs for several generations back.\nWe converts to Islam are usually more thorough-going than born Moslems\nare.  I started to make the pilgrimage to Mecca, riding overland\nalone by way of Persia.  As I came, missing few opportunities to\ntalk with men, who should have been the lights of my religion, I\nhave felt enthusiasm waning.  These weeks past I have contemplated\nreturn without visiting Mecca at all.  I have wandered to and fro,\nhoping for the fervor back again, yet finding none.  And now, sahib,\nI find you--I, Rustum Khan, at a loose end for lack of inspiration.\nI have prayed.  Colonel sahib bahadur, I believe thou art the gift\nof God!\"'\n\nMonty sought our eyes in turn in the lantern-lit darkness.  We made\nno sign.  None of us but he knew the Rajput, so it was plainly his affair.\n\n\"Suit yourself,\" said Will, and the rest of us nodded.\n\n\"We are traveling into the interior,\" said Monty, \"in the rather\ndoubtful hope that our absence from a coast city may in some way\nhelp Armenians, Rustum Khan.\"\n\nThe Rajput jumped to his feet that instant, and came to the salute.\n\n\"I might have known as much.  Colonel Lord Montdidier sahib, I offer\nfealty!  My blood be thine to spill in thy cause!  Thy life on my\nhead--thine honor on my life--thy way my way, and God be my witness!\"\n\n\"Don't be rash, Rustum Khan.  Our likeliest fate is to be taken prisoner\nby men of your religion, who will call you a renegade if you defend\nArmenians.  And what are Armenians to you?\"\n\n\"Ah, sahib!  You drive a sharp spur into an open sore!  I have seen\ntoo much of ill-faith--cruelty--robbery--torture--rapine--butchery,\nall in the name of God!  It is this last threat to the Armenians\nthat is the final straw!  I took the pilgrimage in search of grace.\nThe nearer I came to the place they tell me is on earth the home\nof grace, the more unfaith I see!  Three nights ago in another place\nI was led aside and offered the third of the wealth of a fat Armenian\nif I would lend my sword to slit helpless throats--in the name of\nGod, the compassionate, be merciful!  My temper was about spoilt\nforever when that young idiot over the way described me in his book\nas--never mind how he described me--he paid the price!  Sahib bahadur,\nI take my stand with the defenseless, where I know thou and thy friends\nwill surely be!  I am thy man!\"\n\n\"It is not included in our plans to fight,\" said Monty.\n\n\"Sahib, there is always work for real soldiers!\"\n\n\"What do you fellows say?  Shall we let him come with us?\"\n\n\"I travel at my own charges, sahib.  I am well mounted and well armed.\"\n\n\"Sure, let him come with us!\" said Will.  \"I like the man.\"\n\n\"He has my leave to come along to England afterward,\" said Fred,\n\"if he'll guarantee to address me as the 'gift of God' in public!\"\n\nI left them talking and returned to see whether the \"martyred biped\nMeasel\" needed further help.  He was asleep, and as I listened to\nhis breathing I heard voices in the next room.  The German was talking\nin English, that being often the only tongue that ten men have in\ncommon.  Through the partly opened door I could see that his room\nwas crammed with men.\n\n\"They are spies, every one of them!\" I heard him say.  \"The man I\nthrashed is of their party.  You yourselves saw how they came to\nhis rescue, and seduced the Indian by means of threats.  This is\nthe way of the English.  (\"Curse them!\" said a voice.)  They write\nnotes in a book, and when that offense is detected they burn the\nbook in a corner, as ye saw them do.  I saw the book before they\nburned it.  I thrashed the spy who wrote in the book because he had\nwritten in it reports on what it is proposed to do to infidels at\nthe time ye know about.  I tell you those men are all spies--one\nis as bad as the other.  They work on behalf of Armenians, to bring\nabout interference from abroad.\"\n\nThat he had already produced an atmosphere of danger to us I had\nimmediate proof, for as I crossed the yard again I dodged behind\nan araba in the nick of time to avoid a blow aimed at me with a sword\nby a man I could not see.\n\n\"All your charming is undone!\" I told Fred, bursting in on our party\nby the charcoal brazier.  Almost breathless I reeled off what I had\noverheard.  \"They'll be here to murder us by dawn!\" I said.\n\n\"Will they?\" said Monty.\n\nWe were up and away two hours before dawn, to the huge delight of\nour Turkish muleteers, who consider a dawn start late, yet not too\nearly for the servants of the khan, who knew enough European manners\nto stand about the gate and beg for tips.  Nor were we quite too\nearly for the enemy, who came out into the open and pelted us with\nclods of dung, the German encouraging from the roof.  Fred caught\nhim unaware full in the face with a well-aimed piece of offal.  Then\nthe khan keeper slammed the gate behind us and we rode into the unknown.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Four\n\"We are the robbers, effendi!\"\n\n\nTHE ROAD\n\nThere is a mystery concerning roads\nAnd he who loves the Road shall never tire.\nFor him the brooks have voices and the breeze\nBrings news of far-off leafiness and leas\nAnd vales all blossomy.  The clinging mire\nShall never weary such an one, nor yet their loads\nO'ercome the beasts that serve him. Rock and rill\nShall make the pleasant league go by as hours\nWith secret tales they tell; the loosened stone,\nSweet turf upturned, the bees' full-purposed drone,\nThe hum of happy insects among flowers,\nAnd God's blue sky to crown each hill!\nDawn with her jewel-throated birds\nTo him shall be a new page in the Book\nThat never had beginning nor shall end,\nAnd each increasing hour delights shall lend--\nNew notes in every sound--in every nook\nNew sights----new thoughts too wide for words,\nToo deep for pen, too high for human song,\nThat only in the quietness of winding ways\nFrom tumult and all bitterness apart\nCan find communication with the heart--\nThoughts that make joyous moments of the days,\nAnd no road heavy, and no journey long!\n\n\nThe snow threatened in the mountains had not materialized, and the\nweather had changed to pure perfection.  About an hour after we started\nthe khan emptied itself behind us in a long string, jingling and\nclanging with horse and camel bells.  But they turned northward to\npass through the famed Circassian Gates, whereas we followed the\nplain that paralleled the mountain range--our mules' feet hidden\nby eight inches of primordial ooze.\n\n\"Wish it were only worse!\" said Monty.  \"Snow or rain might postpone\nmassacre.  Delay might mean cancellation.\"\n\nBut there was no prospect whatever of rain.  The Asia Minor spring,\nperfumed and amazing sweet, breathed all about us, spattered with\nlittle diamond-bursts of tune as the larks skyrocketed to let the\nwide world know how glad they were.  Whatever dark fate might be\nbrooding over a nation, it was humanly impossible for us to feel\nlow-spirited.\n\nOur Zeitoonli Armenians trudged through the mud behind us at a splendid\npace--mountain-men with faces toward their hills.  The Turks--owners\nof the animals another man had hired to us--rode perched on top of\nthe loads in stoic silence, changing from mule to mule as the hours\npassed and watching very carefully that no mule should be overtaxed\nor chilled.  In fact, the first attempt they made to enter into\nconversation with us was when we dallied to admire a view of Taurus\nMountain, and one of them closed up to tell us the mules were catching\ncold in the wind.  (If they had been our animals it might have been\nanother story.)\n\nTheir contempt for the Zeitoonli was perfectly illustrated by the\ndifference in situation.  They rode; the Armenians walked.  Yet the\nArmenians were less afraid;  and when we crossed a swollen ford where\na mule caught his forefoot between rocks and was drowning, it was\nArmenians, not Turks, who plunged into the icy water and worked him\nfree without straining as much as a tendon.\n\nThe Turks were obsessed by perpetual fear of robbers.  That, and\nno other motive, made them tolerate the hectoring of Rustum Khan,\nwho had constituted himself officer of transport, and brought up\nthe rear on his superb bay mare.  As he had promised us he would,\nhe rode well armed, and the sight of his pistol holsters, the rifle\nprotruding stock-first from a leather case, and his long Rajput saber\nprobably accomplished more than merely keeping Turks in countenance;\nit prevented them from scattering and bolting home.\n\nHis own baggage was packed on two mules in charge of an Armenian\nboy, who was more afraid of our Turks than they of robbers.  Yet,\nwhen we demanded of our muleteers what sort of men, and of what nation\nthe dreaded highwaymen might be they pointed at Rustum Khan's lean\nservant.  At the khan the night before one of them had pointed out\nto Monty two Circassians and a Kurd as reputed to have a monopoly\nof robbery on all those roads.       Nevertheless, they made the new\naccusation without blinking.\n\n\"All robbers are Armenians--all Armenians are robbers!\" they assured\nus gravely.\n\nWhen we halted for a meal they refused to eat with our Zeitoonli,\nalthough they graciously permitted them to gather all the firewood,\nand accepted pieces of their pasderma (sun-dried meat) as if that\nwere their due.  As soon as they had eaten, and before we had finished,\nIbrahim, their grizzled senior, came to us with a new demand.  On\nits face it was not outrageous, because we were doing our own cooking,\nas any man does who has ever peeped into a Turkish servant's\nbehind-the-scene arrangements.\n\n\"Send those Armenians away!\" he urged.  \"We Turks are worth twice\ntheir number!\"\n\n\"By the beard of God's prophet!\" thundered Rustum Khan, \"who gave\ncamp-followers the right to impose advice?\"\n\n\"They are in league with highwaymen to lead you into a trap!\" Ibrahim\nanswered.\n\nRustum Khan rattled the saber that lay on the rock beside him.\n\n\"I am hunting for fear,\" he said.  \"All my life I have hunted for\nfear and never found it!\"\n\n\"Pekki!\" said Ibrahim dryly.  The word means \"very well.\"  The tone\nimplied that when the emergency should come we should do well not\nto depend on him, for he had warned us.\n\nWe were marching about parallel with the course the completed Baghdad\nrailway was to take, and there were frequent parties of surveyors\nand engineers in sight.  Once we came near enough to talk with the\nGerman in charge of a party, encamped very sumptuously near his work.\nHe had a numerous armed guard of Turks.\n\n\"A precaution against robbers?\" Monty asked, and I did not hear what\nthe German answered.\n\nRustum Khan laughed and drew me aside.\n\n\"Every German in these parts has a guard to protect him from his\nown men, sahib!  For a while on my journey westward I had charge\nof a camp of recruited laborers.  Therefore I know.\"\n\nThe German was immensely anxious to know all about us and our intentions.\nHe told us his name was Hans von Quedlinburg, plainly expecting us\nto be impressed.\n\n\"I can direct you to good quarters, where you can rest comfortably\nat every stage, if you will tell me your direction,\" he said.\n\nBut we did not tell him.  Later, while we ate a meal, he came and\nquestioned our Turks very closely;  but since they were in ignorance\nthey did not tell him either.\n\n\"Why do you travel with Armenian servants?\" he asked us finally before\nwe moved away.\n\n\"We like 'em,\" said Monty.\n\n\"They'll only get you in trouble.  We've dismissed all Armenian laborers\nfrom the railway works.  Not trustworthy, you know.  Our agents are\nout recruiting Moslems.\"\n\n\"What's the matter with Armenians?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't you know?\"\n\n\"I'm asking.\"\n\nThe German shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I'll tell you one thing.  This will illustrate.  I had an Armenian\nclerk.  He worked all day in my tent.  A week ago I found him reading\namong my private papers.  That proves you can't trust an Armenian.\"\n\n\"Ample evidence!\" said Monty without a smile, but Fred laughed as\nwe rode away, and the German stared after us with a new set of emotions\npictured on his heavy face.\n\nLate in the afternoon we passed through a village in which about\ntwo hundred Armenian men and women were holding a gathering in a\nchurch large enough to hold three times the number.  One of them\nsaw us coming, and they all trooped out to meet us, imagining we\nwere officials of some kind.\n\n\"Effendi,\" said their pastor with a trembling hand on Monty's saddle,\n\"the Turks in this village have been washing their white garments!\"\n\nWe had heard in Tarsus what that ceremony meant.\n\n\"It means, effendi, they believe their purpose holy!  What shall\nwe do--what shall we do?\"\n\n\"Why not go into Tarsus and claim protection at the British consulate?\"\nsuggested Fred.\n\n\"But our friends of Tarsus warn us the worst fury of all will be\nin the cities!\"\n\n\"Take to the hills, then!\" Monty advised him.\n\n\"But how can we, sir?  How can we?  We have homes--property--children!\nWe are watched.  The first attempt by a number of us to escape to\nthe hills would bring destruction down on all!\"\n\n\"Then escape to the hills by twos and threes.  You ask my advice--I\ngive it.\"\n\nIt looked like very good advice.  The slopes of the foot-hills seemed\ncovered by a carpet of myrtle scrub, in which whole armies could\nhave lain in ambush.  And above that the cliffs of the Kara Dagh\nrose rocky and wild, suggesting small comfort but sure hiding-places.\n\n\"You'll never make me believe you Armenians haven't hidden supplies,\"\nsaid Monty.  \"Take to the hills until the fury is over!\"\n\nBut the old man shook his head, and his people seemed at one with\nhim.  These were not like our Zeitoonli, but wore the settled gloom\nof resignation that is poor half-brother to Moslem fanaticism, caught\nby subjection and infection from the bullying Turk.  There was nothing\nwe could do at that late hour to overcome the inertia produced by\ncenturies, and we rode on, ourselves infected to the verge of misery.\nOnly our Zeitoonli, striding along like men on holiday, retained\ntheir good spirits, and they tried to keep up ours by singing their\nextraordinary songs.\n\nDuring the day we heard of the chicken, as Will called her, somewhere\non ahead, and we spent that night at a kahveh, which is a place with\nall a khan's inconveniences, but no dignity whatever.  There they\nknew nothing of her at all.  The guests, and there were thirty besides\nourselves, lay all around the big room on wooden platforms, and talked\nof nothing but robbers along the road in both directions.  Every man\nin the place questioned each of us individually to find out why we\nhad not been looted on our way of all we owned, and each man ended\nin a state of hostile incredulity because we vowed we had met no\nrobbers at all.  They shrugged their shoulders when we asked for\nnews of Miss Gloria Vanderman.\n\nThere was no fear of Ibrahim and his friends decamping in the night,\nfor the Zeitoonli kept too careful watch, waiting on them almost\nas thoughtfully as they fetched and carried for us, but never forgetting\nto qualify the service with a smile or a word to the Turks to imply\nthat it was done out of pity for brutish helplessness.\n\nThese Zeitoonli of ours were more obviously every hour men of a different\ndisposition to the meek Armenians of the places where the Turkish\nheel had pressed.  But for our armed presence and the respect accorded\nto the Anglo-Saxon they would have had the whole mixed company down\non them a dozen times that night.\n\n\"I'm wondering whether the Armenians within reach of the Turks are\nnot going to suffer for the sins of mountaineers!\" said Fred, as\nwe warmed ourselves at the great open fire at one end of the room.\n\n\"Rot!\" Will retorted.  \"Sooner or later men begin to dare assert\ntheir love of freedom, and you can't blame 'em if they show it foolishly.\nSome folk throw tea into harbors--some stick a king's head on a\npole--some take it out for the present in fresh-kid stuff.  These\nZeitoonli are men of spirit, or I'll eat my hat!\"\n\nBut if we ourselves had not been men of spirit, obviously capable\nof strenuous self-defense, our Zeitoonli would have found themselves\nin an awkward fix that night.\n\nWe supped off yoghourt--the Turkish concoction of milk--cow's, goat's,\nmare's, ewe's or buffalo's (and the buffalo's is best)--that is about\nthe only food of the country on which the Anglo-Saxon thrives.\nWhatever else is fit to eat the Turks themselves ruin by their way\nof cooking it.  And we left before dawn in the teeth of the owner\nof the kahveh's warning.\n\n\"Dangerous robbers all along the road!\" he advised, shaking his head\nuntil the fez grew insecure, while Fred counted out the coins to\npay our bill.  \"Armenians are without compunction--bad folk!  Ay,\nyou have weapons, but so have they, and they have the advantage of\nsurprise!  May Allah the compassionate be witness, I have warned you!\"\n\n\"There will be more than warnings to be witnessed!\", growled Rustum\nKhan as he rode away.  \"Those others, who sharpened weapons all night\nlong, and spoke of robbers, have been waiting three days at that\nkahveh till the murdering begins!\"\n\nThat morning, on Rustum Khan's advice, we made our Turkish muleteers\nride in front of us.  The Zeitoon men marched next, swinging along\nwith the hillman stride that eats up distance as the ticked-off seconds\neat the day.  And we rode last, admiring the mountain range on our\nleft, but watchful of other matters, and in position to cut off retreat.\n\n\"The last time a Turk ran away from me he took my Gladstone bag with\nhim!\" said Fred.  \"No, only Armenians are dishonest.  It was obedience\nto his prophet, who bade him take advantage of the giaour--quite\na different thing!  Ibrahim's sitting on my kit, and I'm watching\nhim.  You fellows suit yourselves!\"\n\nWe passed a number of men on foot that morning all coming our way,\nbut no Armenians among them.  However, we exchanged no wayside gossip,\nbecause our Zeitoonli in front availed themselves of privilege and\nshouted to every stranger to pass at a good distance.\n\nThat is a perfectly fair precaution in a land where every one goes\narmed, and any one may be a bandit.  But it leads to aloofness.\nPassers-by made circuits of a half-mile to avoid us, and when we\nspurred our mules to get word with them they mistook that for proof\nof our profession and bolted.  We chased three men for twenty minutes\nfor the fun of it, only desisting when one of them took cover behind\na bush and fired a pistol at us with his eyes shut.\n\n\"Think of the lies he'll tell in the kahveh to-night about beating\noff a dozen robbers single-handed!\"  Will laughed.\n\n\"Let's chase the next batch, too, and give the kahveh gang an ear-full!\"\n\n\"I rather think not,\" said Monty.  \"They'll say we're Armenian criminals.\nLet's not be the spark.\"\n\nHe was right, so we behaved ourselves, and within an hour we had\ntrouble enough of another sort.  We began to meet dogs as big as\nNewfoundlands, that attacked our unmounted Zeitoonli, refusing to\nbe driven off with sticks and stones, and only retreating a little\nway when we rode down on them.\n\n\"Shoot the brutes!\" Will suggested cheerfully, and I made ready to\nact on it.\n\n\"For the lord's sake, don't!\" warned Monty, riding at a huge black\nmongrel that was tearing strips from the smock of one of our men.\nThe owner of the dog, seeing its victim was Armenian, rather encouraged\nit than otherwise, leaning on a long pole and grinning in an unfenced\nfield near by.\n\n\"The consul warned me they think more of a dog's life hereabouts\nthan a man's.  In half an hour there'd be a mob on our trail.  Take\nthe Zeitoonli up behind us.\"\n\nRustum Khan was bitter about what he called our squeamishness.  But\nwe each took up a man on his horse's rump, and the dogs decided the\nfun was no longer worth the effort, especially as we had riding whips.\nBut skirmishing with the dogs and picking up the Armenians took time,\nso that our muleteers were all alone half a mile ahead of us, and\nhad disappeared where the road dipped between two hillocks, when\nthey met with the scare they looked for.\n\nThey came thundering back up the road, flogging and flopping on top\nof the loads like the wooden monkeys-on-a-stick the fakers used to\nsell for a penny on the curb in Fleet Street, glancing behind them\nat every second bound like men who had seen a thousand ghosts.\n\nWe brought them to a halt by force, but take them on the whole, now\nthat they were in contact with us, they did not look so much frightened\nas convinced.  They had made up their minds that it was not written\nthat they should go any farther, and that was all about it.\n\n\"Ermenie!\" said Ibrahim.  And when we laughed at that he stroked\nhis beard and vowed there were hundreds of Armenians ambushed by\nthe roadside half a mile ahead.  The others corrected him, declaring\nthe enemy were thousands strong.\n\nFinally Monty rode forward with me to investigate.  We passed between\nthe hillocks, and descended for another hundred yards along a gradually\nsloping track, when our mules became aware of company.  We could\nsee nobody, but their long ears twitched, and they began to make\npreparations preliminary to braying recognition of their kin.\n\nSuddenly Monty detected movement among the myrtle bushes about fifty\nyards from the road, and my mule confirmed his judgment by braying\nlike Satan at a side-show.  The noise was answered instantly by a\nchorus of neighs and brays from an unseen menagerie, whereat the\nowners of the animals disclosed themselves--six men, all smiling,\nand unarmed as far as we could tell--the very same six gipsies who\nhad pitched their tent in the midst of the khan yard at Tarsus.\n\nThen in a clearing at a little distance we saw women taking down\na long low black tent, and between us and them a considerable herd\nof horses, mostly without halters but headed into a bunch by gipsy\nchildren.  Somebody on a gray stallion came loping down toward us,\nleaping low bushes, riding erect with pluperfect hands and seat.\n\n\"I've seen that stallion before!\" said I.\n\n\"And the girl on his back is looking for somebody who owns her heart!\"\nsmiled Monty.  \"Hullo!  Are you the lucky man?\"'\n\nShe reined the stallion in, and took a good, long look at us, shading\nher eyes with her hand but showing dazzling white teeth between coral\nlips.  Suddenly the smile departed, and a look of sullen disappointment\nsettled on her face, as she wheeled the stallion with a swing of\nher lithe body from the hips, and loped away.  Never, apparently,\ndid two men make less impression on a maiden's heart.  The six gipsies\nstood staring at us foolishly, until one of them at last held his\nhand up palm outward.  We accepted that as a peace signal.\n\n\"Are you waiting here for us?\" Monty asked in English, and the oldest\nof the six--a swarthy little man with rather bow legs--thought he\nhad been asked his name.\n\n\"Gregor Jhaere,\" he answered.\n\nFor some vague reason Monty tried him next in Arabic and then in\nHindustanee, but without result.  At last he tried halting Turkish,\nand the gipsy replied at once in German.  As Monty used to get\ntwo-pence or three-pence a day extra when he was in the British army,\nfor knowing something of that tongue, we stood at once on common ground.\n\n\"Kagig told us to wait here and bring you to him,\" said Gregor Jhaere.\n\n\"Where is Kagig?\" Monty asked, and the man smiled blankly--much more\neffectively than if he had shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"We obey Kagig at times,\" he said, as if that admission settled the\nmatter.  Then there was interruption.  Rustum Khan came spurring\ndown the road with his pistol holsters unbuttoned and his saber clattering\nlike a sutler's pots and pans, to see whether we needed help.  He\nhad no sooner reined in beside us than I caught sight of Will, drawn\nbetween curiosity and fear lest the muleteers might bolt, standing\nin his stirrups to peer at us from the top of the track between the\nhillocks.  Somebody else caught sight of him too.\n\nThere came a shrill about from over where the women were packing\nup, and everybody turned to look, Gregor Jhaere included.  As hard\nas the gray stallion could take her in a bee line toward Will the\ndaughter of the dawn with flashing teeth and blazing eyes was riding\nventre a terre.\n\n\"Maga!\" Gregor shouted at her, and then some unintelligible gibberish.\nBut she took no more notice of him than if he had been a crow on\na branch.  In a minute she was beside Will, talking to him, and from\nover the top of the rise we could hear Fred shouting sarcastic\nremonstrance.\n\n\"She is bad!\" Gregor announced in English.  It seemed to be all the\nEnglish he knew.\n\n\"Are you her father?\" Monty asked, and Gregor answered in very\nslipshod German:\n\n\"She is the daughter of the devil.  She shall be soundly thrashed!\nThe chalana!* And he a Gorgio!\"**\n\n----------------\n* Chalana--She jockey (a compliment).\n** Gorgio--Gentile (an insult).\n----------------\n\nSuddenly Fred began to shout for help then, and we rode back, the\ngipsies following and Rustum Khan remaining on guard between them\nand their camp with his upbrushed black beard bristling defiance\nof Asia Minor.  Our Turkish muleteers had decided to make a final\nbolt for it, and were using their whips on the Zeitoonli, who clung\ngamely to the reins.  As soon as we got near enough to lend a hand\nthe Turks resigned themselves with a kind of opportune fatalism.\nThe Zeitoonli promptly turned the tables on them by laying hold of\na leg of each and tipping them off into the mud.  Ibrahim showed\nhis teeth, and reached for a hidden weapon as he lay, but seemed\nto think better of it.  It looked very much as if those four Zeitoonli\nknew in advance exactly what the interruption in our journey meant.\n\nWill was out of the running entirely, or else the rest of us were,\ndepending on which way one regarded it.  He had eyes for nobody and\nnothing but the girl, nor she for any one but him, and nobody could\nrightfully blame either of them.  Yankee though he is, Will sat his\nmule in the western cowboy style, and he was wearing a cowboy hat\nthat set his youth off to perfection.  She looked fit to flirt with\nthe lord of the underworld, answering his questions in a way that\nwould have made any fellow eager to ask more.  Strangely enough,\nGregor Jhaere, presumably father of the girl appeared to have lost\nhis anger at her doings and turned his back.\n\nFred, smiling mischief, started toward them to horn in, as Will would\nhave described it, but at that moment about a dozen of the gipsy\nwomen came padding uproad, fostered watchfully by Rustum Khan, who\nseemed convinced that murder was intended somehow, somewhere.  They\nbrought along horses with them--very good horses--and Fred prefers\na horse trade to triangular flirtation on any day of any week.\n\nThe gipsies promptly fell to and off-saddled our loads under Gregor\nJhaere's eye, transferring them to the meaner-looking among the beasts\nthe women had brought, taking great care to drop nothing in the mud.\nAnd at a word from Gregor two of the oldest hags came to lift us\nfrom our saddles one by one, and hold us suspended in mid-air while\nthe saddles were transferred to better mounts.  But there is an indignity\nin being held out of the mud by women that goes fiercely against\nthe white man's grain, and I kicked until they set me back in\nthe saddle.\n\nMonty solved the problem by riding to higher, clean ground near the\nroadside, where we could stand on firm grass.\n\nSeeing us dismounted, the gipsies underwent a subtle mental change\npeculiar to all barbarous people.  To the gipsy and the cossack,\nand all people mainly dependent on the horse, to be mounted is to\nsignify participation in affairs.  To be dismounted means to stand\naside and \"let George do it.\"\n\nGregor Jhaere became a different man.  He grew noisy and in response\nto his yelped commands they swooped in unprovoked attack on our unhappy\nmuleteers.  Before we could interfere they had thrown each Turk face\ndownward, our Zeitoonli helping, and were searching them with swift\nintruding fingers for knives, pistols, money.\n\nThe Turk leaves his money behind when starting on a journey at some\nother man's expense;  but they did draw forth a most astonishing\nassortment of weapons.  They were experts in disarmament.  Maga Jhaere\nlost interest in Will for a moment, and pricked her stallion to a\nplace where she could judge the assortment better. Without any hesitation\nshe ordered one of the old women to pass up to her a mother-o'-pearl\nornamented Smith & Wesson, which she promptly hid in her bosom. Judging\nby the sounds he made, that pistol was the apple of Ibrahim's old\neye, but he had seen the last of it.  When we interfered, and he\ncould get to her stirrup to demand it back, Maga spat in his face;\nwhich was all about it, except that Monty made generous allowance\nfor the thing when paying the reckoning presently.  As our servants,\nthose Turks were, of course, entitled to our protection, and besides\nthat weapon we had to pay for five knives that were gone beyond hope\nof recovery.\n\nMonty paid our Turks off (for it was evident that even had they been\nwilling they would not have been allowed to proceed with us another\nmile).  Then, as Ibrahim mounted and marshaled his party in front of him,\nhe forgot manners as well as the liberal payment.\n\n\"Mashallah!\" (God be praised!) he shouted, with the slobber of excitement\non his lips and beard.  \"Now I go to make Armenians pay for this!\nLet the shapkali,* too, avoid me!  Ya Ali, ya Mahoma, Alahu!\"  (Oh,\nAli, oh, Mahomet, God is God!)\n\n---------------\n* Shapkali--hatted man-foreigner.\n---------------\n\n\"Let's hope they haven't a spark of honesty!\" said Monty cryptically,\nwatching them canter away.\n\n\"Why on earth--?\"\n\n\"Let's hope they ride back to the consul and swear they haven't received\none piaster of their pay.  That would let him know we're clear away!\"\n\n\"Optimist!\" jeered Will.  \"That consul's a Britisher.  He'd take\ntheir lie literally, and deduce we're no good!\"\n\nFor the moment the girl on the gray stallion had ridden away from\nWill and was giving regal orders to the mob of women and shrill children,\nwho obeyed her as if well used to it.  Gregor Jhaere and his men\nstood staring at us, Gregor shaking his head as if our letting the\nTurks go free had been a bad stroke of policy.\n\n\"Aren't you afraid to travel with all that mob of women and cattle?\"\nasked Monty.  \"We've heard of robbers on the road.\"\n\n\"We are the robbers, effendi!\" said Gregor with an air of modesty.\nThe others smirked, but he seemed disinclined to over-insist on the\ngulf between us.\n\n\"Hear him!\" growled Rustum Khan.  \"A thief, who boasts of thieving\nin the presence of sahibs!  So is corruption, stinking in the sun!\"\n\nHe added something in another language that the gipsies understood,\nfor Gregor started as if stung and swore at him, and Maga Jhaere\nleft her women-folk to ride alongside and glare into his eyes.  They\nwere enemies, those two, from that hour forward.  He, once Hindu,\nnow Moslem, had no admiration whatever to begin with for unveiled\nwomen.  And, since the gipsy claims to come from India and may therefore\nbe justly judged by Indian standards, and has no caste, but is beneath\nthe very lees of caste, he loathed all gipsies with the prejudice\npeculiar to men who have deserted caste in theory and in self-protection\nclaim themselves above it.  It was a case of height despising deep\nin either instance, she as sure of her superiority as he of his.\n\nThere might have been immediate trouble if Monty had not taken his\nnew, restless, fresh horse by the mane and swung into the saddle.\n\n\"Forward, Rustum Khan!\" he ordered.  \"Ride ahead and let those keen\neyes of yours keep us out of traps!\"\n\nThe Rajput obeyed, but as he passed Will he checked his mare a moment,\nand waiting until Will's blue eyes met his he raised a warning finger.\n\n\"Kubadar, sahib!\"\n\nThen he rode on, like a man who has done his duty.\n\n\"What the devil does he mean?\" demanded Will.\n\n\"Kubadar means, 'Take care'!\" said Monty.  \"Come on, what are we\nwaiting for?\"\n\nThat was the beginning, too, of Will's feud with the Rajput, neither\nso remorseless nor so sudden as the woman's, because he had a different\ncode to guide him and also had to convince himself that a quarrel\nwith a man of color was compatible with Yankee dignity.  We could\nhave wished them all three either friends, or else a thousand miles\napart two hundred times before the journey ended.\n\nAs we rode forward with even our Zeitoonli mounted now on strong\nmules, Maga Jhaere sat her stallion beside Will with an air of\nowning him.  She was likely a safer friend than enemy, and we did\nnothing to interfere.  Monty pressed forward.  Fred and I fell to\nthe rear.\n\n\"Haide!\"* shouted Gregor Jhaere, and all the motley swarm of women\nand children caught themselves mounts--some already loaded with the\ngipsy baggage, some with saddles, some without, some with grass halters\nfor bridles.  In another minute Fred and I were riding surrounded\nby a smelly swarm of them, he with big fingers already on the keys\nof his beloved concertina, but I less enamored than he of the company.\n\n-----------------\n* Haide!--Turkish, \"Come on!\"\n-----------------\n\nWomen and children, loaded, loose and led horses were all mixed together\nin unsortable confusion, the two oldest hags in the world trusting\nthemselves on sorry, lame nags between Fred and me as if proximity\nto us would solve the very riddle of the gipsy race.  And last of\nall came a pack of great scrawny dogs that bayed behind us hungrily,\nfollowing for an hour until hope of plunder vanished.\n\n\"That little she-devil who has taken a fancy to Will,\" said Fred\nwith a grin, \"is capable of more atrocities than all the Turks between\nhere and Stamboul!  She looks to me like Santanita, Cleopatra, Salome,\nCaesar's wife, and all the Borgia ladies rolled in one.  There's\nsomething added, though, that they lacked.\"\n\n\"Youth,\" said I.  \"Beauty.  Athletic grace.  Sinuous charm.\"\n\n\"No, probably they all had all those.\"\n\n\"Then horsemanship.\"\n\n\"Perhaps.  Didn't Cleopatra ride?\"\n\n\"Then what?\" said I, puzzled.\n\n\"Indiscretion!\" he answered, jerking loose the catch of his infernal\ninstrument.\n\n\"Don't be afraid, old ladies,\" he said, glancing at the harridans\nbetween us.  \"I'm only going to sing!\"\n\nHe makes up nearly all of his songs, and some of them, although\nirreverent, are not without peculiar merit;  but that was one of\nhis worst ones.\n\nThe preachers prate of fallen man\nAnd choirs repeat the chant,\nWhile unco' guid with unction urge\nRepression of the joys that surge,\nAnd jail for those who can't.\nThe poor deluded duds forget\nThat something drew the sting\nWhen Adam tiptoed to his fall,\nAnd made it hardly hurt at all.\nOf Mother Eve I sing!\n\nCHORUS\nOh, Mother Eve, dear Mother Eve,\nThe generations come and go,\nBut daughter Eve's as live as you\nWere back in Eden years ago!\n\nOh, hell's not hell with Eve to tell\nAgain the ancient tale,\nBut Eden's grassy ways and bowers\nDeprived of Eve to ease the hours\nWould very soon grow stale!\nRed cherry lips that leap to laugh,\nAnd chic and flick and flair\nCan make black white for any one--\nThe task of Sisyphus good fun!\nSo what should Adam care!\n\nCHORUS\nOh, daughter Eve, dear daughter Eve,\nThe tribulations go and come,\nBut no adventure's ever tame\nWith you to make surprises hum!\n\n\n\n\nChapter Five\n\"Effendi, that is the heart of Armenia burning.\"\n\n\nTHE PATTERAN\n\n(I)\n\nAye-yee--I see--a cloud afloat in air af amethyst\nI know its racing shadow falls on banks of gold\nWhere rain-rejoicing gravel warms the feeding roots\nAnd smells more wonderful than wine.\nI know the shoots of myrtle and of asphodel now stir the mould\nWhere wee cool noses sniff the early mist.\nAye-yee--the sparkle of the little springs I see\nThat tinkle as they hunt the thirsty rill.\nI know the cobwebs glitter with the jeweled dew.\nI see a fleck of brown--it was a skylark flew\nTo scatter bursting music, and the world is still\nTo listen.  Ah, my heart is bursting too--Aye-yee!\n\nChorus:\n(It begins with a swinging crash, and fades away.)\n\nAye-yee, aye-yah--the kites see far\n(But also to the foxes views unfold)--\nNo hour alike, no places twice the same,\nNor any track to show where morning came,\nNor any footprint in the moistened mould\nTo tell who covered up the morning star.\n      Aye-yee--aye-yah!\n\n\n(2)\nAye-yee--I see--new rushes crowding upwards in the mere\nWhere, gold and white, the wild duck preens himself\nSafe hidden till the sun-drawn, lingering mists melt.\nI know the secret den where bruin dwelt.\nI see him now sun-basking on a shelf\nOf windy rock.  He looks down on the deer,\nWho flit like flowing light from rock to tree\nAnd stand with ears alert before they drink.\nI know a pool of purple rimmed with white\nWhere wild-fowl, warming for the morning flight,\nWait clustering and crying on the brink.\nAnd I know hillsides where the partridge breeds.  Aye-yee!\n\nChorus:\nAye-yee, aye-yah--the kites see far\n(But also to the owls the visions change)--\nNo dawn is like the next, and nothing sings\nOf sameness--very hours have wings\nAnd leave no word of whose hand touched the range\nOf Kara Dagh with opal and with cinnabar.\n      Aye-yee, aye-yah!\n\n(3)\nAye-yee--I see--new distances beyond a blue horizon flung.\nI laugh, because the people under roofs believe\nThat last year's ways are this!\nNo roads are old! New grass has grown!\nAll pools and rivers hold New water!\nAnd the feathered singers weave\nNew nests, forgetting where the old ones hung!\nAye-yah--the muddy highway sticks and clings,\nBut I see in the open pastures new\nUnknown to busne* in the houses pent!\nI hear the new, warm raindrops drumming on the tent,\nI feel already on my feet delicious dew,\nI see the trail outflung!  And oh, my heart has wings!\n\n\nChorus:\nAye-yee, aye-yah--the kites see far\n(But also on the road the visions pass)--\nThe universe reflected in a wayside pool,\nA tinkling symphony where seeping waters drool,\nThe dance, more gay than laughter, of the wind-swept grass--\nOh, onward!  On to where the visions are!\n      Aye-yee--aye-yah!\n\n---------------------\n* Busne--Gipsy word--Gentile, or non-gipsy.\n---------------------\n\n\nRussia, Rumania, Bulgaria, Bohemia, Persia, Armenia were all one\nhunting-ground to the troupe we rode with.  Even the children seemed\nto have a smattering of most of the tongues men speak in those intriguing\nlands.  Will and the girl beside him conversed in German, but the\nold hag nearest me would not confess acquaintance with any language\nI knew.  Again and again I tried her, but she always shook her head.\n\nFred, with his ready gift of tongues, attempted conversation with\nten or a dozen of them, but whichever language he used in turn appeared\nto be the only one which that particular individual did not know.\nAll he got in reply was grins, and awkward silence, and shrugs of\nthe shoulders in Gregor's direction, implying that the head of the\nfirm did the talking with strangers.  But Gregor rode alone with\nMonty, out of ear-shot.\n\nMaga (for so they all called her) flirted with Will outrageously,\nif that is flirting that proclaims conquest from the start, and sets\nflashing white teeth in defiance of all intruders.  Even the little\nchildren had hidden weapons, but Maga was better armed than any one,\nand she thrust the new mother-o-pearl-plated acquisition in the face\nof one of the men who dared drive his horse between hers and Will's.\nThat not serving more than to amuse him, she slapped him three times\nback-handed across the face, and thrusting the pistol back into her\nbosom, drew a knife.  He seemed in no doubt of her willingness to\nuse the steel, and backed his horse away, followed by language from\nher like forked lightning that disturbed him more than the threatening\nweapon.  Gipsies are great believers in the efficiency of a curse.\n\nNothing could be further from the mark than to say that Will tried\nto take advantage of Maga's youth and savagery.  Fred and I had shared\na dozen lively adventures with him without more than beginning yet\nto plumb the depths of his respect for Woman.  Only an American in\nall the world knows how to meet Young Woman eye to eye with totally\nunpatronizing frankness, and he was without guile in the matter.\nBut not so she.  We did not know whether or not she was Gregor Jhaere's\ndaughter;  whether or not she was truly the gipsy that she hardly\nseemed.  But she was certainly daughter of the Near East that does\nnot understand a state of peace between the sexes.  There was nothing\nlawful in her attitude, nor as much as the suspicion that Will might\nbe merely chivalrous.\n\n\"America's due for sex-enlightenment!\" said I.\n\n\"Warn him if you like,\" Fred laughed, \"and then steer clear!  Our\nAmerica is proud besides imprudent!\"\n\nFred off-shouldered all responsibility and forestalled anxiety on\nany one's account by playing tunes, stampeding the whole cavalcade\nmore than once because the horses were unused to his clanging concertina,\nbut producing such high spirits that it became a joke to have to\ndismount in the mud and replace the load on some mule who had expressed\nenjoyment of the tune by rolling in slime, or by trying to kick clouds\nout of the sky.\n\nAnd strangely enough he brought about the very last thing he intended\nwith his music--stopped the flirtation's immediate progress.  Maga\nseemed to take to Fred's unchastened harmony with all the wildness\nthat possessed her.  Some chord he struck, or likelier, some abandoned\nsuccession of them touched off her magazine of poetry.  And so she sang.\n\nThe only infinitely gorgeous songs I ever listened to were Maga's.\nAlmighty God, who made them, only really knows what country the gipsies\noriginally came from, but there is not a land that has not felt their\nfeet, nor a sorrow they have not witnessed.  Away back in the womb\nof time there was planted in them a rare gift of seeing what the\nrest of us can only sometimes hear, and of hearing what only very\nfew from the world that lives in houses can do more than vaguely\nfeel when at the peak of high emotion.  The gipsies do not understand\nwhat they see, and hear, and feel;  but they are aware of infinities\ntoo intimate for ordinary speech.  And it was given to Maga to sing\nof all that, with a voice tuned like a waterfall's for open sky,\nand trees, and distances--not very loud, but far-carrying, and flattened\nin quarter-tones where it touched the infinite.\n\nFred very soon ceased from braying with his bellowed instrument.\nHer songs were too wild for accompaniment--interminable stanzas of\nunequal length, with a refrain at the end of each that rose through\na thousand emotions to a crash of ecstasy, and then died away to\ndreaminess, coming to an end on an unfinished rising scale.\n\nAll the gipsies and our Zeitoonli and Rustum Khan's lean servant\njoined in the refrains, so that we trotted along under the snow-tipped\nfangs of the Kara Dagh oblivious of the passage of time, but very\nkeenly conscious of touch with a realm of life whose existence hitherto\nwe had only vaguely guessed at.\n\nThe animals refused to weary while that singing testified of tireless\nharmonies, as fresh yet as on the day when the worlds were born.\nWe rattled forward, on and upward, as if the panorama were unrolling\nand we were the static point, getting out of nobody's way for the\nbest reason in the world--that everybody hid at first sight or sound\nof us, except when we passed near villages, and then the great\nfierce-fanged curs chased and bayed behind us in short-winded fury.\n\n\"The dogs bark,\" quoted Fred serenely, \"but the caravan moves on!\"\n\nAn hour before dark we swung round a long irregular spur of the hills\nthat made a wide bend in the road, and halted at a lonely kahveh--a\nwind-swept ruin of a place, the wall of whose upper story was\npatched with ancient sacking, but whose owner came out and smiled\nso warmly on us that we overlooked the inhospitable frown of his\nunplastered walls, hoping that his smile and the profundity of his\nsalaams might prove prophetic of comfort and cleanliness within.\nVain hope!\n\nMaga left Will's side then, for there was iron-embedded custom to\nbe observed about this matter of entering a road-house.  In that\nland superstition governs just as fiercely as the rest those who\nmake mock of the rule-of-rod religions, and there is no man or woman\nfree to behave as he or she sees fit.  Every one drew aside from\nMonty, and he strode in alone through the split-and-mended door,\nwe following next, and the gipsies with their animals clattered noisily\nbehind us.  The women entered last, behind the last loaded mule,\nand Maga the very last of all, because she was the most beautiful,\nand beauty might bring in the devil with it only that the devil is\ntoo proud to dawdle behind the old hags and the horses.\n\nWe found ourselves in an oblong room, with stalls and a sort of pound\nfor animals at one end and an enormous raised stone fireplace at\nthe other.  Wooden platforms for the use of guests faced each other\ndown the two long sides, and the only promise of better than usual\ncomfort lay in the piles of firewood waiting for whoever felt rich\nand generous enough to foot the bill for a quantity.\n\nBut an agreeable surprise made us feel at home before ever the fire\nleaped up to warm the creases out of saddle-weary limbs.  We had\ngiven up thinking of Kagig, not that we despaired of him, but the\ngipsies, and especially Maga, had replaced his romantic interest\nfor the moment with their own.  Now all the man's own exciting claim\non the imagination returned in full flood, as he arose leisurely\nfrom a pile of skins and blankets near the hearth to greet Monty,\nand shouted with the manner of a chieftain for fuel to be piled on\ninstantly--\"For a great man comes!\" he announced to the rafters.\nAnd the kahveh servants, seven sons of the owner of the place, were\nswift and abject in the matter of obeisance.  They were Turks.  All\nTurks are demonstrative in adoration of whoever is reputed great.\nMonty ignored them, and Kagig came down the length of the room to\noffer him a hand on terms of blunt equality.\n\n\"Lord Montdidier,\" he said, mispronouncing the word astonishingly,\n\"this is the furthest limit of my kingdom yet.  Kindly be welcome!\"\n\n\"Your kingdom?\" said Monty, shaking hands, but not quite accepting\nthe position of blood-equal.  He was bigger and better looking than\nKagig, and there was no mistaking which was the abler man, even at\nthat first comparison, with Kagig intentionally making the most of\na dramatic situation.\n\nKagig laughed, not the least nervously.\n\n\"Mirza,\" he said in Persian, \"duzd ne giriftah padshah ast!\"  (Prince,\nthe uncaught thief is king.)\n\nHe was wearing a kalpak--the head-gear of the cossack, which would\nmake a high priest look outlawed, and a shaggy goat-skin coat that\nhad seen more than one campaign.  Unmistakably the garment had been\nslit by bullets, and repaired by fingers more enthusiastic than adept.\nThere was a pride of poverty about him that did not gibe well with\nhis boast of being a robber.\n\n\"That's the first gink we've met in this land who didn't claim to\nbe something better than he looked!\" Will whispered.\n\n\"Hopeless, I suppose!\" Fred answered.  \"Never mind.  I like the man.\"\n\nIt was evident that Monty liked him, too, for all his schooled reserve.\nKagig ordered one of the owner's sons to sweep a place near the fire,\nand there he superintended the spreading of Monty's blankets, close\nenough to his own assorted heap for conversation without mutual offense.\nWill cleaned for himself a section of the opposite end of the platform,\nand Fred and I spread our blankets next to his.  That left Rustum\nKhan in a quandary.  He stood irresolute for a minute, eying first\nthe gipsies, who had stalled most of their animals and were beginning\nto occupy the platform on the other side;  then considering the wide\ngap between me and Monty.  The dark-skinned man of breeding is far\nmore bitterly conscious of the color-line than any white knows how to be.\n\nWe watched, disinclined to do the choosing for him, racial instinct\nuppermost.  Rustum Khan strolled back to where his mare was being\ncleaned by the lean Armenian servant, gave the boy a few curt orders,\nand there among the shadows made his mind up.  He returned and stood\nbefore Monty, Kagig eying him with something less than amiability.\nHe pointed toward the ample room remaining between Monty and me.\n\n\"Will the sahib permit?  My izzat (honor) is in question.\"\n\n\"Izzat be damned!\" Monty answered.\n\nRustum Khan colored darkly.\n\n\"I shared a tent with you once on campaign, sahib, in the days before--the\ngood days before--those old days when--\"\n\n\"When you and I served one Raj, eh? I remember,\" Monty answered.\n\"I remember it was your tent, Rustum Khan.  Unless memory plays tricks\nwith me, the Orakzai Pathans had burned mine, and I had my choice\nbetween sharing yours or sleeping in the rain.\"\n\n\"Truly, huzoor.\"\n\n\"I don't recollect that I mouthed very much about honor on that occasion.\nIf anybody's honor was in question then, I fancy it was yours.  I\nmight have inconvenienced myself, and dishonored you, I suppose,\nby sleeping in the wet.  You can dishonor the lot of us now, if you\ncare to, by--oh, tommyrot!  Tell your man to put your blankets in\nthe only empty place, and behave like a man of sense!\"\n\n\"But, huzoor--\"\n\nMonty dismissed the subject with a motion of his hand, and turned\nto talk with Kagig, who shouted for yoghourt to be brought at once;\nand that set the sons of the owner of the place to hurrying in great\nstyle.  The owner himself was a true Turk.  He had subsided into\na state of kaif already over on the far side of the fire, day-dreaming\nabout only Allah knew what rhapsodies.  But the Turks intermarry\nwith the subject races much more thoroughly than they do anything\nelse, and his sons did not resemble him.  They were active young\nmen, rather noisy in their robust desire to be of use.\n\nThe gipsies, with Gregor Jhaere nearest to the owner of the kahveh\nand the fireplace, occupied the whole long platform on the other\nside, each with his women around him--except that I noticed that\nMaga avoided all the men, and made herself a blanket nest in deep\nshadow almost within reach of a mule's heels at the far end.  I believed\nat the moment that she chose that position so as to be near to Will,\nbut changed my mind later.  Several times Gregor shouted for her,\nand she made no answer.\n\nThe place had no other occupants.  Either we were the only travelers\non that road that night or, as seemed more likely, Kagig had exercised\nauthority and purged the kahveh of other guests.  Certainly our coming\nhad been expected, for there was very good yoghourt in ample quantity,\nand other food besides--meat, bread, cheese, vegetables.\n\nWhen we had all eaten, and lay back against the stone wall looking\nat the fire, with great fanged shadows dancing up and down that made\nthe scene one of almost perfect savagery,  Gregor called again for\nMaga.  Again she did not answer him.  So he rose from his place and\nreached for a rawhide whip.\n\n\"I said she shall be thrashed!\" he snarled in Turkish, and he made\nthe whip crack three times like sudden pistol-shots.  Will did not\ncatch the words, and might not have understood them in any case,\nbut Rustum Khan, beside me, both heard and understood.\n\n\"Atcha!\" he grunted.  \"Now we shall see a kind of happenings.  That\ngirl is not a true gipsy, or else my eyes lie to me.  They stole\nher, or adopted her.  She lacks their instincts.  The gitanas, as\nthey call their girls, are expected to have aversion to white men.\nThey are allowed to lure a white man to his ruin, but not to make\nhot love to him.  She has offended against the gipsy law.  The attaman*\nmust punish.  Watch the women.  They take it all as a matter of course.\"\n\n----------------\n*Attaman, gipsy headman.\n----------------\n\n\"Maga!\" thundered Gregor Jhaere, cracking the great whip again.\nI thought that Kagig looked a trifle restless, but nobody else went\nso far as to exhibit interest, except that the old Turk by the fire\nemerged far enough out of kaif to open one eye, like a sly cat's.\n\nThe attaman shouted again, and this time Maga mocked him.  So he\nstrode down the room in a rage to enforce his authority, and dragged\nher out of the shadow by an arm, sending her whirling to the center\nof the floor.  She did not lose her feet, but spun and came to a\nstand, and waited, proud as Satanita while he drew the whip slowly\nback with studied cruelty.  The old Turk opened both eyes.\n\nNothing is more certain than that none of us would have permitted\nthe girl to be thrashed.  I doubt if even Rustum Khan, no admirer\nof gipsies or unveiled women, would have tolerated one blow.  But\nWill was nearest, and he is most amazing quick when his nervous New\nEngland temper is aroused.  He had the whip out of Gregor's hand,\nand stood on guard between him and the girl before one of us had\ntime to move.  The old Turk closed his eyes again, and sighed resignedly.\n\n\"Our preux chevalier--preux but damned imprudent!\" murmured Fred.\n\"Let's hope there's a gipsy here with guts enough to fight for title\nto the girl.  It looks to me as if Will has claimed her by patteran*\nlaw.  The only man with right to say whether or not a woman shall\nbe thrashed is her owner.  Once that right is established--\"\n\n---------------\n* Patteran, a gipsy word: trail.\n---------------\n\n\"Touch her and I'll break your neck!\" warned Will, without undue\nemotion, but truthfully beyond a shadow of a doubt.\n\nThe gipsy stood still, simmering, and taking the measure of the capable\nAmerican muscles interposed between him and his legal prey.  Every\ngipsy eye in the room was on him, and it was perfectly obvious that\nwhatever the eventual solution of the impasse, the one thing he could\nnot do was retreat.  We were fewer in number, but much better armed\nthan the gipsy party, so that it was unlikely they would rally to\ntheir man's aid.  Kagig was an unknown quantity, but except that\nhis black eyes glittered rather more brightly than usual he made\nno sign;  and we kept quiet because we did not want to start a\nfree-for-all fight.   Will was quite able to take care of any single\nopponent, and would have resented aid.\n\nSuddenly, however, Gregor Jhaere reached inside his shirt.  Maga\nscreamed.  Rustum Khan beside me swore a rumbling Rajput oath, and\nwe all four leapt to our feet.  Maga drew no weapon, although she\ncertainly had both dagger and pistol handy.  Instead, she glanced\ntoward Kagig, who, strangely enough, was lolling on his blankets\nas if nothing in the world could interest him less.  The glance took\nas swift effect as an electric spark that fires a mine.  He stiffened\ninstantly.\n\n\"Yok!\" he shouted, and at once there ceased to be even a symptom\nof impending trouble.  Yok means merely no in Turkish, but it conveyed\nenough to Gregor to send him back to his place between his women\nand the Turk unashamedly obedient, leaving Maga standing beside Will.\nMaga did not glance again at Kagig, for I watched intently.  There\nwas simply no understanding the relationship, although Fred affected\nhis usual all-comprehensive wisdom.\n\n\"Another claimant to the title!\" he said.  \"A fight between Will\nand Kagig for that woman ought to be amusing, if only Will weren't\na friend of mine.  Watch America challenge him!\"\n\nBut Will did nothing of the kind.  He smiled at Maga, offered her\na cigarette, which she refused, and returned to his place beyond\nFred, leaving her standing there, as lovely in the glowing firelight\nas the spirit of bygone romance.  At that Kagig shouted suddenly\nfor fuel, and three of the Turk's seven hoydens ran to heap it on.\n\nInstantly the leaping flames transformed the great, uncomfortable,\ndraughty barn into a hall of gorgeous color and shadows without limit.\nThere was no other illumination, except for the glow here and there\nof pipes and cigarettes, or matches flaring for a moment. Barring\nthe tobacco, we lay like a baron's men-at-arms in Europe of the Middle\nAges, with a captive woman to make sport with in the midst, only\nrather too self-reliant for the picture.\n\nFeeling himself warm, and rested, and full enough of food, Fred flung\na cigarette away and reached for his inseparable concertina.  And\nwith his eyes on the great smoked beams that now glowed gold and\ncrimson in the firelight, he grew inspired and made his nearest to\nsweet music.  It was perfectly in place--simple as the savagery\nthat framed us--Fred's way of saying grace for shelter, and adventure,\nand a meal.  He passed from Annie Laurie to Suwannee River, and all\nbut made Will cry.\n\nDuring two-three-four tunes Maga stood motionless in the midst of\nus, hands on her hips, with the fire-light playing on her face, until\nat last Fred changed the nature of the music and seemed to be trying\nto recall fragments of the song she had sung that afternoon.  Presently\nhe came close to achievement, playing a few bars over and over, and\nleading on from those into improvization near enough to the real\nthing to be quite recognizable.\n\nMusic is the sure key to the gipsy heart, and Fred unlocked it.\nThe men and women, and the little sleepy children on the long wooden\nplatform opposite began to sway and swing in rhythm.  Fred divined\nwhat was coming, and played louder, wilder, lawlessly.  And Maga\ndid an astonishing thing.  She sat down on the floor and pulled her\nshoes and stockings off, as unselfconsciously as if she were alone.\n\nThen Fred began the tune again from the beginning, and he had it\nat his finger-ends by then.  He made the rafters ring.  And without\na word Maga kicked the shoes and stockings into a corner, flung her\nouter, woolen upper-garment after them, and began to dance.\n\nThere is a time when any of us does his best.\nMoney--marriage--praise--applause (which is totally another thing\nthan praise, and more like whisky in its\nworkings)--ambition--prayer--there is a key to the heart of each of us\nthat can unlock the flood-tides of emotion and carry us nolens volens\nto the peaks of possibility.  Either Will, or else Fred's music, or\nthe setting, or all three unlocked her gifts that night.  She danced\nlike a moth in a flame--a wandering woman in the fire unquenchable\nthat burns convention out of gipsy hearts, and makes the\npatteran--the trail--the only way worth while.\n\nOpposite, the gipsies sprawled in silence on their platform, breathing\na little deeper when deepest approval stirred them, a little more\nquickly when her Muse took hold of Maga and thrilled her to expression\nof the thoughts unknown to people of the dinning walls and streets.\n\nWe four leaned back against our wall in a sort of silent revelry,\nFred alone moving, making his beloved instrument charm wisely, calling\nto her just enough to keep a link, as it were, through which her\nimagery might appeal to ours.  Some sort of mental bridge between\nher tameless paganism and our twentieth-century twilight there had\nto be, or we never could have sensed her meaning.  The concertina's\nwailings, mid-way between her intelligence and ours, served well enough.\n\nMy own chief feeling was of exultation, crowing over the hooded\ncity-folk, who think that drama and the tricks of colored light and\nshade have led them to a glimpse of the hem of the garment of Unrest--a\ncheap mean feeling, of which I was afterward ashamed.\n\nMaga was not crowing over anybody.  Neither did she only dance of\nthings her senses knew.  The history of a people seized her for a\nreed, and wrote itself in figures past imagining between the crimson\nfirelight; and the shadows of the cattle stalls.\n\nHer dance that night could never have been done with leather between\nbare foot and earth.  It told of measureless winds and waters--of\nthe distances, the stars, the day, the night-rain sweeping down--dew\ndropping gently--the hundred kinds of birds-the thousand animals\nand creeping things--and of man, who is lord of all of them, and\nwoman, who is lord of man--man setting naked foot on naked earth\nand glorying with the thrill of life, new, good, and wonderful.\n\nOne of the Turk's seven sons produced a saz toward the end--a little\nTurkish drum, and accompanied with swift, staccato stabs of sound\nthat spurred her like the goads of overtaking time toward the peak\nof full expression--faster and faster--wilder and wilder--freer and\nfreer of all limits, until suddenly she left the thing unfinished,\nand the drum-taps died away alone.\n\nThat was art--plain art.  No human woman could have finished it.\nIt was innate abhorrence of the anticlimax that sent her, having\nlooked into the eyes of the unattainable, to lie sobbing for short\nbreath in her corner in the dark, leaving us to imagine the ending\nif we could.\n\nAnd instead of anticlimax second climax came.  Almost before the\nechoes of the drum-taps died among the dancing shadows overhead a\nvoice cried from the roof in Armenian, and Kagig rose to his feet.\n\n\"Let us climb to the roof and see, effendim,\" he said, pulling on\nhis tattered goat-skin coat.\n\n\"See what, Ermenie?\" demanded Rustum Khan.  The Rajput's eyes were\nstill ablaze with pagan flame, from watching Maga.\n\n\"To see whether thou hast manhood behind that swagger!\" answered\nKagig, and led the way.  No man ever yet explained the racial aversions.\n\n\"Kopek!--dog, thou!\" growled the Rajput, but Kagig took no notice\nand led on, followed by Monty and the rest of us.  Maga and the gipsies\ncame last, swarming behind us up the ladder through a hole among\nthe beams, and clambering on to the roof over boxes piled in the\ndraughty attic.  Up under the stars a man was standing with an arm\nstretched out toward Tarsus.\n\n\"Look!\" he said simply.\n\nTo the westward was a crimson glow that mushroomed angrily against\nthe sky, throbbing and swelling with hot life like the vomit of a\ncrater.  We watched in silence for three minutes, until one of the\ngipsy women began to moan.\n\n\"What do you suppose it is?\" I asked then.\n\n\"I know what it is,\" said Kagig simply.\n\n\"Tell then.\"\n\n\"'Effendi, that is the heart of Armenia burning.  Those are the homes\nof my nation--of my kin!\"\n\n\"And good God, where d'you suppose Miss Vanderman is?\" Fred exclaimed.\n\nWill was standing beside Maga, looking into her eyes as if he hoped\nto read in them the riddle of Armenia.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Six\n\"Passing the buck to Allah!\"\n\n\nLAUS LACHRIMABILIS\n\nSo now the awaited ripe reward--\nYour cactus crown!  Since I have urged\n\"Get ready for the untoward\"\nYe bid me reap the wrath I dirged;\nAnd I must show the darkened way,\nWho beckoned vainly in the light!\nI'll lead.  But salt of Dead Sea spray\nWere sweeter on my lips to-night!\n\nOh, days of aching sinews, when I trod the choking dust\nWith feet afire that could not tire, atremble with the trust\nMore mighty in my inner man than fear of men without,\nThe word I heard on Kara Dagh and did not dare to doubt--\nTimely warning, clear to me as starlight after rain\nWhen, sleepless on eternal hills, I saw the purpose plain\nAnd left, swift-foot at dawn, obedient, to break\nThe news ye said was no avail--advice ye would not take!\n\nOh,--nights of tireless talking by the hearth of hidden fires--\nOn roofs, behind the trade-bales--among oxen in the byres--\nOut in rain between the godowns, where the splashing puddles warn\nOf tiptoeing informers;  when I faced the freezing dawn\nWith set price on my head, but still the set resolve untamed,\nNot melted by the mockery, by no suspicion shamed,\nTo hide by day in holes, abiding dark and wind and rain\nThat loosed me straining to the task ye ridiculed again!\n\nOh, weeks of empty waiting, while the enemy designed\nIn detail how to loot the stuff ye would not leave behind!\nWorse weeks of empty agony when, helpless and alone,\nI watched in hiding for the crops from that seed I had sown;\n\nFor dust-clouds that should prove at last Armenia awake--\nA nation up and coming!  I had labored for your sake,\nI had hungered, I had suffered.  Ye had well rewarded then\nIf ye had come, and hanged me just to prove that ye were men!\n\nBut all the pride was promises, the criticism jeers;\nYe had no heart for sacrifice, and I no time for tears.\nI offered--nay, I gave!  I squandered body and breath and soul,\nI bared the need, I showed the way, I preached a goodly goal,\nI urged you choose a leader, since your faith in me was dim,\nI swore to serve the chief ye chose, and teach my lore to him,\nSo he should reap where I had sown.  And yet ye bade me wait--\nAnd waited till, awake at last, ye bid me lead too late!\n\nAnd so, in place of ripe reward,\nYour cactus crown! And I, who urged\n\"Get ready for the untoward\"\nMust drink the dregs of wrath I dirged!\nYe bid me set time's finger back!\nAnd stage anew the opened fight!\nI'll lead.  But slime of Dead Sea wrack\nWere sweeter on my lips this night!\n\n\nThe first thought that occurred to each of us four was that Kagig\nhad probably lied, or that he had merely voiced his private opinion,\nbased on expectation. The glare in the distance seemed too big and\nsolid to be caused by burning houses, even supposing a whole village\nwere in flames.  Yet there was not any other explanation we could\noffer.  A distant cloud of black smoke with bulging red under-belly\nrolled away through the darkness like a tremendous mountain range.\n\nWe stood in silence trying to judge how far away the thing might\nbe, Kagig standing alone with his foot on the parapet, his goat-skin\ncoat hanging like a hussar's dolman, and Monty pacing up and down\nalong the roof behind us all.  The gipsies seemed able to converse\nby nods and nudges, with now and then one word whispered.  After\na little while Maga whispered in Will's ear, and he went below with\nher.  All the gipsies promptly followed.  Otherwise in the darkness\nwe might not have noticed where Will went.\n\n\"That proves she is no gipsy!\" vowed Rustum Khan, standing between\nFred and me.  \"They, would have trusted one of their own kind.\"\n\n\"They call her Maga Jhaere,\" said I.  \"The attaman's name is Jhaere.\nDon't you suppose he's her father?\"\n\n\"If he were her father he would have no fear,\" the Rajput answered.\n\"All gipsies are alike.  Their women will dance the nautch, and promise\nunchastity as if that were a little matter.  But when it comes to\nperformance of promises the gitana* is true to the Rom.**  It is\nbecause she is no gipsy that they follow her now to watch.  And it\nis because men say that Americans are Mormons and polygamous, and\nvery swift in the use of revolvers, that all follow instead of one\nor two!\"\n\n--------------\n* Gitana, gipsy young woman.\n** Rom--Gipsy husband, or family man.\n--------------\n\n\"Go down then, and make sure they don't murder him!\" commanded Monty,\nand Rustum Khan turned to obey with rather ill grace.  He contrived\nto convey by his manner that he would do anything for Monty, even\nto the extent of saving the life of a man he disliked.  At the moment\nwhen he turned there came the sound of a troop of horses galloping\ntoward us.\n\n\"I will first see who comes,\" he said.\n\n\"The blood of Yerkes sahib on your head, Rustum Khan!\" Monty answered.\nAt that he went below.\n\nBut neither were we destined to remain up there very long.  We heard\ncolossal thumping in the kahveh beneath us and presently the Rajput's\nhead reappeared through the opening in the roof.\n\n\"The fools are barricading the door,\" he shouted.  \"They make sure\nthat an enemy outside could burn us inside without hindrance!\"\n\nAt that Kagig came along the roof to our corner and looked into Monty's\neyes.  Fred and I stood between the two of them and the parapet,\nbecause for the first few seconds we were not sure the Armenian did\nnot mean murder.  His eyes glittered, and his teeth gleamed.  It\nwas not possible to guess whether or not the hand under his goat-skin\ncoat clutched a weapon.\n\n\"It is now that you Eenglis sportmen shall endure a test!\" he remarked.\n\nExactly as in the Yeni Khan in Tarsus when we first met him there\nwas a moment now of intense repulsion, entirely unaccountable, succeeded\ninstantly by a wave of sympathy.  I laughed aloud, remembering how\nstrange dogs meeting in the street to smell each other are swept\nby unexplainable antipathies and equally swift comradeship.  He thought\nI laughed at him.\n\n\"Neye geldin?\" he growled in Turkish.  \"Wherefore didst thou come?\nTo cackle like a barren hen that sees another laying?  Nichevo,\"\nhe added, turning his back on me.  And that was insolence in Russian,\nmeaning that nobody and nothing could possibly be of less importance.\nHe seemed to keep a separate language for each set of thoughts.\n\"Let us go below.  Let us stop these fools from making too much trouble,\"\nhe added in English.  \"One man ought to stay on the roof.  One ought\nto be sufficient.\"\n\nSince he had said I did not matter, I remained, and it was therefore\nI who shouted down a challenge presently in round English at a party\nwho clattered to the door on blown horses, and thundered on it as\nif they had been shatirs* hurrying to herald the arrival of the sultan\nhimself.  There was nothing furtive about their address to the decrepit\ndoor, nor anything meek.  Accordingly I couched the challenge in\nterms of unmistakable affront, repeating it at intervals until the\nleader of the new arrivals chose to identify himself.\n\n-----------------\n* Shatir, the man who runs before a personage's horse.\n-----------------\n\n\"I am Hans von Quedlinburg!\" he shouted.  But I did not remember\nthe name.\n\n\"Only a thief would come riding in such a hurry through the night!\"\nsaid I.  \"Who is with you?\"\n\nAnother voice shouted very fast and furiously in Turkish, but I could\nnot make head or tail of the words.  Then the German resumed the\nsong and dance.\n\n\"Are you the party who talked with me at my construction camp?\"\n\n\"We talk most of the time.  We eat food.  We whistle.  We drink.\nWe laugh!\" said I.\n\n\"Because I think you are the people I am seeking.  These are Turkish\nofficials with me.  I have authority to modify their orders, only\nlet me in!\"\n\n\"How many of you?\" I asked.  I was leaning over at risk of my life,\nfor any fool could have seen my head to shoot at it against the luminous\ndark sky; but I could not see to count them.\n\n\"Never mind how many!  Let us in!  I am Hans von Quedlinburg.  My\nname is sufficient.\"\n\nSo I lied, emphatically and in thoughtful detail.\n\n\"You are covered,\" I said, \"by five rifles from this roof.  If you\ndon't believe it, try something.  You'd better wait there while I\nwake my chief.\"\n\n\"Only be quick!\" said the German, and I saw him light a cigarette,\nwhether to convince me he felt confident or because he did feel so\nI could not say.  I went below, and found Monty and Kagig standing\ntogether close to the outer door.  They had not heard the whole of\nthe conversation because of the noise the owner's sons had made removing,\nat their orders, the obstructions they had piled against the door\nin their first panic.  Every one else had returned to the sleeping\nplatforms, except the Turkish owner, who looked awake at last, and\nwas hovering here and there in ecstasies of nervousness.\n\nI repeated what the German had said, rather expecting that Kagig\nat any rate would counsel defiance.  It was he, however, who beckoned\nthe Turk and bade him open the door.\n\n\"But, effendi--\"\n\n\"Chabuk! Quickly, I said!\"\n\n\"Che arz kunam?\" the Turk answered meekly, meaning \"What petition\nshall I make?\" the inference being that all was in the hands of Allah.\n\n\"Of ten men nine are women!\" sneered Kagig irritably, and led the\nway to our place beside the fire.  The Turk fumbled interminably\nwith the door fastenings, and we were comfortably settled in our\nplaces before the new arrivals rode in, bringing a blast of cold\nair with them that set the smoke billowing about the room and made\nevery man draw up his blankets.\n\n\"Shut that door behind them!\" thundered Kagig.  \"If they come too\nslowly, shut the laggards out!\"\n\n\"Who is this who is arrogant?\" the German demanded in English.\n\nHe was a fine-looking man, dressed in civilian clothes cut as nearly\nto the military pattern as the tailor could contrive without transgressing\nlaw, but with a too small fez perched on his capable-looking head\nin the manner of the Prussian who would like to make the Turks believe\nhe loves them.  Rustum Khan cursed with keen attention to detail\nat sight of him.  The man who had entered with him became busy in\nthe shadows trying to find room to stall their horses, but Von Quedlinburg\ngave his reins to an attendant, and stood alone, akimbo, with the\nfirelight displaying him in half relief.\n\n\"I am a man who knows, among other things, the name of him who bribed\nthe kaimakam.* on Chakallu,\" Kagig answered slowly, also in English.\n\n---------------\n* Kaimakam, headman (Turkish).\n---------------\n\nThe German laughed.\n\n\"Then you know without further argument that I am not to be denied!\"\nhe answered.  \"What I say to-night the government officials will\nconfirm to-morrow!  Are you Kagig, whom they call the Eye of Zeitoon?\"\n\n\"I am no jackal,\" said Kagig dryly, punning on the name Chakallu,\nwhich means \"place of jackals.\"\n\nThe German coughed, set one foot forward, and folded both arms on\nhis breast.  He looked capable and bold in that attitude, and knew\nit.  I knew at last who he was, and wondered why I had not recognized\nhim sooner--the contractor who had questioned us near the railway\nencampment along the way, and had offered us directions; but his\nmanner was as different now from then as a bully's in and out of\nschool.  Then he had sought to placate, and had almost cringed to\nMonty.  Everything about him now proclaimed the ungloved upper hand.\n\nHis party, finding no room to stall their horses, had begun to turn\nours loose, and there was uproar along the gipsy side of the room--no\naction yet, but a threatening snarl that promised plenty of it.\nWill was half on his feet to interfere, but Monty signed to him to\nkeep cool;  and it was Monty's aggravatingly well-modulated voice\nthat laid the law down.\n\n\"Will you be good enough,\" he asked blandly, \"to call off your men\nfrom meddling with our mounts?\"  He could not be properly said to\ndrawl, because there was a positive subacid crispness in his voice\nthat not even a Prussian or a Turk on a dark night could have\nover-looked.\n\nThe German laughed again.\n\n\"Perhaps you did not hear my name,\" he said. \"I am Hans von Quedlinburg.\nAs over-contractor on the Baghdad railway I have the privilege of\nprior accommodation at all road-houses in this province--for myself\nand my attendants.  And in addition there are with me certain Turkish\nofficers, whose rights I dare say you will not dispute.\"\n\nMonty did not laugh, although Fred was chuckling in confident enjoyment\nof the situation.\n\n\"You need a lesson in manners,\" said Monty.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" demanded Hans von Quedlinburg.\n\nMonty rose to his feet without a single unnecessary motion.\n\n\"I mean that unless you call off your men--at once this minute from\ninterfering with our animals I shall give you the lesson you need.\"\n\nThe German saluted in mock respect.  Then he patted his breast-pocket\nso as to show the outline of a large repeating pistol.  Monty took\ntwo steps forward.  The German drew the pistol with an oath.  Will\nYerkes, beyond Fred and slightly behind the German, coughed meaningly.\nThe German turned his head, to find that he was covered by a pistol\nas large as his own.\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" he said, \"what is the use of making a scene?\"  He\nthrust his pistol back under cover and shouted an order in Turkish.\nMonty returned to his place and sat down.  The newcomers at the rear\nof the room tied their horses together by the bridles, and Hans von\nQuedlinburg resumed his well-fed smile.\n\n\"Let it be clearly understood,\" he said, \"that you have interfered\nwith official privilege.\"\n\n\"As long as you do your best in the way of manners you may go on\nwith your errand,\" said Monty.\n\nSuddenly Fred laughed aloud.\n\n\"The martyred biped!\" he yelped.\n\nHe was right.  Peter Measel, missionary on his own account, and sometime\nkeeper of most libelous accounts, stepped out from the shadows and\nessayed to warm himself, walking past the German with a sort of mincing\ngait not calculated to assert his manliness.  Hans von Quedlinburg\nstretched out a strong arm and hurled him back again into the darkness\nat the rear.\n\n\"Tchuk-tchuk!  Zuruck!\" he muttered.\n\nIt clearly disconcerted him to have his inferiors in rank assert\nthemselves.  That accounted, no doubt, for the meek self-effacement\nof the Turks who had come with him.  Peter Measel did not appear\nto mind being rebuked.  He crossed to the other side of the room,\nand proceeded to look the gipsies over with the air of a learned\nethnologist.\n\n\"You speak of my errand,\" said Hans von Quedlinburg, \"as if you imagine\nI come seeking favors.  I am here incidentally to rescue you and\nyour party from the clutches of an outlaw.  The Turkish officials\nwho are with me have authority to arrest everybody in this place,\nyourselves included.  Fortunately I am able to modify that.  Kagig--that\nrascal beside you--is a well-known agitator.  He is a criminal.\nHis arrest and trial have been ordered on the charge, among other\nthings, of stirring up discontent among the Armenian laborers on\nthe railway work.  These gipsies are all his agents.  They are all\nunder arrest.  You yourselves will be escorted to safety at the coast.\"\n\n\"Why should we need an escort to safety?\" Monty demanded.\n\n\"Were you on the roof?\" the German answered.  \"And is it possible\nyou did not see the conflagration?  An Armenian insurrection has\nbeen nipped in the bud.  Several villages are burning.  The other\ninhabitants are very much incensed, and all foreigners are in\ndanger--yourselves especially, since you have seen fit to travel in\ncompany with such a person as Kagig.\"\n\n\"What has Peter Measel got to do with it?\" demanded Fred.  \"Has he\nbeen writing down all our sins in a new book?\"\n\n\"He will identify you.  He will also identify Kagig's agents.  He\nbrings a personal charge against a man named Rustum Khan, who must\nreturn to Tarsus to answer it.  The charge is robbery with violence.\"\n\nRustum Khan snorted.\n\n\"The violence was only too gentle, and too soon ended.  As for robbery,\nif I have robbed him of a little self-conceit, I will answer to God\nfor that when my hour shall come!  How is it your affair to drag\nthat whimpering fool through Asia at your tail--you a German and\nhe English?\"\n\nThe German had a hot answer ready for that, but the Turks had discovered\nMaga Jhaere in hiding in the shadows between two old women.  She\nscreamed as they tried to drag her forth, and the scream brought\nus all to our feet.  But this time it was Kagig who was swiftest,\nand we got our first proof of the man's enormous strength.  Fred,\nWill and I charged together round behind the newcomers' horses, in\norder to make sure of cutting off retreat as well as rescuing Maga.\nMonty leveled a pistol at the German's head.  But Kagig did not waste\na fraction of a second on side-issues of any sort.  He flew at the\nGerman's throat like a wolf at a bullock.  The German fired at him,\nmissed, and before he could fire again he was caught in a grip he\ncould not break, and fighting for breath, balance and something more.\n\nOne of the gipsies, who had not seen the need of hurrying to Maga's\naid, now proved the soundness of his judgment by divining Kagig's\npurpose and tossing several new faggots on the already prodigious fire.\n\n\"Good!\" barked Kagig, bending the struggling German this and that\nway as it pleased him.\n\nSeeing our man with the upper hand, Monty and Rustum Khan now hurried\ninto the melee, where two Turkish officers and eight zaptieh were\nfighting to keep Maga from four gipsies and us three.  Nobody had\nseen fit to shoot, but there was a glimmering of cold steel among\nthe shadows like lightning before a thunder-storm.  Monty used his\nfists.  Rustum Khan used the flat of a Rajput saber.  Maga, leaving\nmost of her clothing in the Turk's hands, struggled free and in another\nsecond the Turks were on the defensive.  Rustum Khan knocked the\nrevolver out of an officer's hand, and the rest of them were struggling\nto use their rifles, when the German shrieked.  All fights are full\nof pauses, when either side could snatch sudden victory if alert\nenough.  We stopped, and turned to look, as if our own lives were\nnot in danger.\n\nKagig had the German off his feet, face toward the flames, kicking\nand screaming like a madman.  He whirled him twice--shouted a sort\nof war-cry--hove him high with every sinew in his tough frame\ncracking--and hurled him head-foremost into the fire.\n\nThe Turks took the cue to haul off and stand staring at us.  We all\nwithdrew to easier pistol range, for contrary to general belief,\nclose quarters almost never help straight aim, especially when in\na hurry.  There is a shooting as well as a camera focus, and each\nman has his own.\n\nPretty badly burnt about the face and fingers, Hans von Quedlinburg\ncrawled backward out of the fire, smelling like the devil, of singed\nwool.  Kagig closed on him, and hurled him back again.  This time\nthe German plunged through the fire, and out beyond it to a space\nbetween the flames and the back wall, where it must have been hot\nenough to make the fat run.  He stood with a forearm covering his\nface, while Kagig thundered at him voluminous abuse in Turkish.\nI wondered, first, why the German did not shoot, and then why his\nloaded pistol did not blow up in the heat, until I saw that in further\nproof of strength Kagig had looted his pistol and was standing with\none foot on it.\n\nFinally, when the beautiful smooth cloth of which his coat was made\nbad taken on a stinking overlay of crackled black, the German chose\nto obey Kagig and came leaping back through the fire, and lay groaning\non the floor, where the kahveh's owner's seven sons poured water\non him by Kagig's order.  His burns were evidently painful, but not\nnearly so serious as I expected.  I got out the first-aid stuff from\nour medicine bag, and Will, who was our self-constituted doctor on\nthe strength of having once attended an autopsy, disguised as a reporter,\nin the morgue at the back of Bellevue Hospital in New York City,\nbeckoned a gipsy woman, and proceeded to instruct her what to do.\n\nHowever, Hans von Quedlinburg was no nervous weakling.  He snatched\nthe pot of grease from the woman's hands, daubed gobs of the stuff\nliberally on his face and hands, and sat up--resembling an unknown\nkind of angry animal with his eyebrows and mustache burned off except\nfor a stray, outstanding whisker here and there.  In a voice like\na bull's at the smell of blood he reversed what he had shouted through\nthe flames, and commanded his Turks to arrest the lot of us.\n\nKagig laughed at that, and spoke to him in English, I suppose in\norder that we, too, might understand.\n\n\"Those Turks are my prisoners!\" he said.  \"And so are you!\"\n\nIt was true about the Turks.  They had not given up their weapons\nyet, but the gipsies were between them and the door, and even the\ngipsy women were armed to the teeth and willing to do battle.  I\ncaught sight of Maga's mother-o'-pearl plated revolver, and the Turkish\nofficer at whom she had it leveled did not look inclined to dispute\nthe upper hand.\n\n\"You Germans are all alike,\" sneered Kagig.  \"A dog could read your\nreasoning.  You thought these foreigners would turn against me.\nIt never entered your thick skull that they might rather defy you\nthan see me made prisoner.  Fool!  Did men name me Eye of Zeitoon\nfor nothing?  Have I watched for nothing!  Did I know the very wording\nof the letters in your private box for nothing?  Are you the only\nspy in Asia?  Am I Kagig, and do I not know who advised dismissing\nall Armenians from the railway work?  Am I Kagig, and do I not know\nwhy?  Kopek! (Dog!)  You would beggar my people, in order to curry\nfavor with the Turk.  You seek to take me because I know your ways!\nTwo months ago you knew to within a day or two when these new massacres\nwould begin.  One month, three weeks, and four days ago you ordered\nmen to dig my grave, and swore to bury me alive in it!  What shall\nhinder me from burning you alive this minute?\"\n\nThere were five good hindrances, for I think that Rustum Khan would\nhave objected to that cruelty, even had he been alone.  Kagig caught\nMonty's eye and laughed.\n\n\"Korkakma!\" he jeered.  \"Do not be afraid!\"  Then he glanced swiftly\nat the Turks, and at Peter Measel, who was staring all-eyes at Maga\non the far side of the room.\n\n\"Order your pigs of zaptieh to throw their arms down!\"\n\nInstead, the German shouted to them to fire volleys at us.  He was\nnot without a certain stormy courage, whatever Kagig's knowledge\nof his treachery.\n\nBut the Turks did not fire, and it was perfectly plain that we four\nwere the reason of it.  They had been promised an easy prey--captured\nwomen--loot--and the remunerative task of escorting us to safety.\nDoubtless Von Quedlinburg had promised them our consul would be lavish\nwith rewards on our account.  Therefore there was added reason why\nthey should not fire on Englishmen and an American.  We had not made\na move since the first scuffle when we rescued Maga, but the Turkish\nlieutenant had taken our measure.  Perhaps he had whispered to his\nmen.  Perhaps they reached their own conclusions.  The effect was\nthe same in either case.\n\n\"Order them to throw their weapons down!\" commanded Kagig, kicking\nthe German in the ribs.  And his coat had been so scorched in the\nfierce heat that the whole of one side of it broke off, like a\ncinder slab.\n\nThis time Hans von Quedlinburg obeyed.  For one thing the pain of\nhis burns was beginning to tell on him, but he could see, too, that\nhe had lost prestige with his party.\n\n\"Throw down your weapons!\" he ordered savagely.\n\nBut he had lost more prestige than he knew, or else he had less in\nthe beginning than be counted on.  The Turkish lieutenant--a man\nof about forty with the evidence of all the sensual appetites very\nplainly marked on his face--laughed and brought his men to attention.\nThen he made a kind of half-military motion with his hand toward\neach of us in turn, ignoring Kagig but intending to convey that we\nat any rate need not feel anxious.\n\nIt was Maga Jhaere who solved the riddle of that impasse.  She was\nhardly in condition to appear before a crowd of men, for the Turks\nbad torn off most of her clothes, and she had not troubled to find\nothers.  She was unashamed, and as beautiful and angry as a panther.\nWith panther suddenness she snatched the lieutenant's sword and pistol.\n\nIt suited neither his national pride nor religious prejudices to\nbe disarmed by a gipsy woman;  but the Turk is an amazing fatalist,\nand unexpectedness is his peculiar quality.\n\n\"Che arz kunam?\" he muttered--the perennial comment of the Turk who\nhas failed, that always made Kagig bare his teeth in a spasm of contempt.\n\"Passing the buck to Allah,\" as Will construed it.\n\nBut disarming the mere conscript soldiers was not quite so simple,\nalthough Maga managed it.  They had less regard for their own skins\nthan handicapped their officer, and yet more than his contempt for\nthe female of any human breed.\n\nThey refused point-blank to throw their rifles down, bringing a laugh\nand a shout of encouragement from the German.  But she screwed the\nmuzzle of her pistol into the lieutenant's ear, and bade him enforce\nher orders, the gipsy women applauding with a chorus of \"Ohs\" and\n\"Ahs.\"  The lieutenant succumbed to force majeure, and his men, who\nwere inclined to die rather than take orders from a woman, obeyed\nhim readily enough.  They laid their rifles down carefully, without\na suggestion of resentment.\n\n\"So.  The women of Zeitoon are good!\" said Kagig with a curt nod\nof approval, and Maga tossed him a smile fit for the instigation\nof another siege of Troy.\n\nThe gipsy women picked the rifles up, and Maga went to hunt through\nthe mule-packs for clothing.  Then Kagig turned on us, motioning\nwith his toe toward Hans von Quedlinburg, who continued to treat\nhimself extravagantly from our jar of ointment.\n\n\"You do not know yet the depths of this man's infamy!\" he said.\n\"The world professes to loathe Turks who rob, sell and murder women\nand children.  What of a German--a foreigner in Turkey, who instigates\nthe murder--and the robbery--and the burning--and the butchery--for\nhis own ends, or for his bloody country's ends?  This man is\nan instigator!\"\n\n\"You lie!\" snarled Von Quedlinburg.  \"You dog of an Armenian, you lie!\"\nKagig ignored him.\n\n\"This is the German sportman who tried once to go to Zeitoon to shoot\nbears, as he said.  But I knew he was a spy.  I am not the Eye of\nZeitoon merely because that title rolls nicely on the tongue.  He\nhas--perhaps he has it in his pocket now--a concession from the\npoliticians in Stamboul, granting him the right to exploit Zeitoon--a\nplace he has never seen!  He has encouraged this present butchery\nin order that Turkish soldiers may have excuse to penetrate to Zeitoon\nthat he covets.  He wants you Eenglis sportmen out of the way.  You\nwere to be sent safely back to Tarsus, lest you should be witnesses\nof what must happen.  Perhaps you do not believe all this?\"'\n\nHe stooped down and searched the German's coat pockets with impatient\nfingers that tugged and jerked, tossing out handkerchief and wallet,\ncigars, matches that by a miracle had not caught in the heat, and\nconsiderable money to the floor.  He took no notice of the money,\nbut one of the old gipsy women crept out and annexed it, and Kagig\nmade no comment.\n\n\"He has not his concession with him.  I can prove nothing to-night.\nI said you shall stand a test.  You must choose.  This German and\nthose Turks are my prisoners.  You have nothing to do with it.  You\nmay go back to Tarsus if you wish, and tell the Turks that Kagig\ndefies them!  You shall have an escort as far as the nearest garrison.\nYou shall have fifty men to take you back by dawn to-morrow.\"\n\nAt that Rustum Khan turned several shades darker and glared truculently.\n\n\"Who art thou, Armenian, to frame a test for thy betters?\" he demanded,\nthrowing a very military chest.  And Will promptly bridled at the\nRajput's attitude.\n\n\"You've no call to make yourself out any better than he is!\" he\ninterrupted.  And at that Maga Jhaere threw a kiss from across the\nroom, but one could not tell whether her own dislike of Rustum Khan,\nor her approval of Will's support of Kagig was the motive.\n\nFred began humming in the ridiculous way he has when he thinks that\nan air of unconcern may ease a situation, and of course Rustum Khan\nmistook the nasal noises for intentional insult.  He turned on the\nunsuspecting Fred like a tiger.  Monty's quick wit and level voice\nalone saved open rupture.\n\n\"What I imagine Rustum Khan means is this, Kagig:  My friends and\nI have engaged you as guide for a hunting trip.  We propose to hold\nyou strictly to the contract.\"\n\nKagig looked keenly at each of us and nodded.\n\n\"In my day I have seen the hunters hunted!\" he said darkly.\n\n\"In my day I have seen an upstart punished!\" growled the Rajput,\nand sat down, back to the wall.\n\n\"Castles, and bears!\" smiled Monty.\n\nKagig grinned.\n\n\"What if I propose a different quarry?\"\n\n\"Propose and see!\" Monty was on the alert, and therefore to all outward\nappearance in a sort of well-fed, catlike, dallying mood.\n\n\"This dog,\" said Kagig, and he kicked the German's ribs again, \"has\nsaid nothing of any other person he must rescue.  Bear me witness.\"\n\nWe murmured admission of the truth of that.\n\n\"Yet I am the Eye of Zeitoon, and I know.  His purpose was to leave\nhis prisoners here and hurry on to overtake a lady--a certain Miss\nVanderman, who he thinks is on her way to the mission at Marash.\nHe desired the credit for her rescue in order better to blind the\nworld to his misdeeds!  Nevertheless, now that she can be no more\nuse to him, observe his chivalry!  He does not even mention her!\"\n\nThe German shrugged his shoulders, implying that to argue with such\na savage was waste of breath.\n\n\"What do you know of Miss Vanderman's where-abouts?\" demanded Will,\nand Maga Jhaere, at the sound of another woman's name, sat bolt upright\nbetween two other women whose bright eyes peeped out from under blankets.\n\n\"I had word of her an hour before you came, effendi,\" Kagig answered.\n\"She and her party took fright this afternoon, and have taken to\nthe hills.  They are farther ahead than this pig dreamed\"--once more\nhe kicked Von Quedlinburg--\"more than a day's march ahead from here.\"\n\n\"Then we'll hunt for her first,\" said Monty, and the rest of us nodded\nassent.\n\nKagig grinned.\n\n\"You shall find her.  You shall see a castle.  In the castle where\nyou find her you shall choose again!  It is agreed, effendi!\"\n\nThen he ordered his prisoners made fast, and the gipsies and our\nZeitoonli servants attended to it, he himself, however, binding the\nGerman's hands and feet.  Will went and put bandages on the man's burns,\nI standing by, to help.  But we got no thanks.\n\n\"Ihr seit verruckt!\" he sneered.  \"You take the side of bandits.\nPasst mal auf--there will be punishment!\"\n\nThe Zeitoonli were going to tie Peter Measel, but he set up such\na howl that Kagig at last took notice of him and ordered him flung,\nunbound, into the great wooden bin in which the horse-feed was kept\nfor sale to wayfarers.  There he lay, and slept and snored for the\nrest of that session, with his mouth close to a mouse-hole.\n\nThen Kagig ordered our Zeitoonli to the roof on guard, and bade us\nsleep with a patriarchal air of authority.\n\n\"There is no knowing when I shall decide to march,\" he explained.\n\nGiven enough fatigue, and warmth, and quietness, a man will sleep\nunder almost any set of circumstances.  The great fire blazed, and\nflickered, and finally died down to a bed of crimson.  The prisoners\nwere most likely all awake, for their bonds were tight, but only\nKagig remained seated in the midst of his mess of blankets by the\nhearth;  and I think he slept in that position, and that I was the\nlast to doze off.  But none of us slept very long.\n\nThere came a shout from the roof again, and once again a thundering\non the door.  The move--unanimous--that the gipsies' right hands\nmade to clutch their weapons resembled the jump from surprise into\nstillness when the jungle is caught unawares.  A second later when\nsomebody tossed dry fagots on the fire the blaze betrayed no other\nexpression on their faces than the stock-in-trade stolidity.  Even\nthe women looked as if thundering on a kahveh door at night was nothing\nto be noticed.  Kagig did not move, but I could see that he was breathing\nfaster than the normal, and he, too, clutched a weapon.  Von Quedlinburg\nbegan shouting for help alternately in Turkish and in German, and\nthe owner of the place produced a gun--a long, bright, steel-barreled\naffair of the vintage of the Comitajes and the First Greek War.\nHe and his sons ran to the door to barricade it.\n\n\"Yavash!\" ordered Kagig.  The word means slowly, as applied to all\nthe human processes.  In that instance it meant \"Go slow with your\nnoise!\" and mine host so understood it.\n\nBut the thundering on the great door never ceased, and the kahveh\nwas too full of the noise of that for us to hear what the Zeitoonli\ncalled down from the roof.  Kagig arose and stood in the middle of\nthe room with the firelight behind him.  He listened for two minutes,\nstanding stock-still, a thin smile flickering across his lean face,\nand the sharp satyr-like tops of his ears seeming to prick outward\nin the act of intelligence.\n\n\"Open and let them in!\" he commanded at last.\n\n\"I will not!\" roared the owner of the place.  \"I shall be tortured,\nand all my house!\"\n\n\"Open, I said!\"\n\n\"But they will make us prisoner!\"\n\nKagig made a sign with his right hand.  Gregor Jhaere rose and whispered.\nOne by one the remaining gipsies followed him into the shadows, and\nthere came a noise of scuffling, and of oaths and blows.  As Gregor\nJhaere had mentioned earlier, they did obey Kagig now and then.\nThe Turks came back looking crestfallen, and the fastenings creaked.\nThen the door burst open with a blast of icy air, and there poured\nin nineteen armed men who blinked at the firelight helplessly.\n\n\"Kagig--where is Kagig?\"\n\n\"You cursed fools, where should I be!\"\n\n\"Kagig?  Is it truly you?\"  Their eyes were still blinded by\nthe blaze.\n\n\"Shut that door again, and bolt it!  Aye--Kagig, Kagig, is it you!\"\n\n\"It is Kagig!  Behold him!  Look!\"\n\nThey clustered close to see, smelling infernally of sweaty garments\nand of the mud from unholy lurking places.\n\n\"Kagig it is!  And has all happened as I, Kagig, warned you it\nwould happen?\"\n\n\"Aye.  All.  More.  Worse!\"\n\n\"Had you acted beforehand in the manner I advised?\"\n\n\"No, Kagig.  We put it off.  We talked, and disagreed.  And then\nit was too late to agree.  They were cutting throats while we still\nargued.  When we ran into the street to take the offensive they were\nalready shooting from the roofs!\"\n\n\"Hah!\"\n\nThat bitter dry expletive, coughed out between set teeth, could not\nbe named a laugh.\n\n\"Kagig, listen!\"\n\n\"Aye!  Now it is 'Kagig, listen!'  But a little while ago it was\nI who was sayin 'Listen!'  I walked myself lame, and talked myself\nhoarse.  Who listened to me?  Why should I listen to you?\"\n\n\"But, Kagig, my wife is gone!\"\n\n\"Hah!\"\n\n\"My daughter, Kagig!\"\n\n\"Hah!\"\n\nA third man thrust himself forward and thumped the butt of a long\nrifle on the floor.\n\n      --\n\n\"They took my wife and two daughters before my very eyes, Kagig!\nIt is no time for talking now--you have talked already too much,\nKagi,--now prove yourself a man of deeds!  With these eyes I saw\nthem dragged by the hair down street!  Oh, would God that I had put\nmy eyes out first, then had I never seen it!  Kagig--\"\n\n\"Aye--Kagig!\"\n\n\"You shall not sneer at me!  I shot one Turk, and ten more pounced\non them.  They screamed to me.  They called to me to rescue.  What\ncould I do?  I shot, and I shot until the rifle barrel burned my\nfingers.  Then those cursed Turks set the house on fire behind me,\nand my companions dragged me away to come and find others to unite\nwith us and make a stand!  We found no others!  Kagig--I tell\nyou--those bloody Turks are auctioning our wives and daughters in the\nvillage church!  It is time to act!\"\n\n\"Hah!  Who was it urged you in season and out of season--day and\nnight--month in, month out--to come to Zeitoon and help me fortify\nthe place?  Who urged you to send your women there long ago?\"\n\n\"But Kagig, you do not appreciate.  To you it is nothing not to have\nwomen near you.  We have mothers, sisters, wives--\"\n\n\"Nothing to me, is it?  These eyes have seen my mother, ravished\nby a Kurd in a Turkish uniform!\"\n\n\"Well, that only proves you are one with us after all!  That only\nproves--\"\n\n\"One with you!  Why did you not act, then, when I risked life and\nlimb a thousand times to urge you?\"\n\n\"We could not, Kagig.  That would have precipitated--\"\n\nHe interrupted the man with an oath like the aggregate of bitterness.\n\n\"Precipitated?  Did waiting for the massacre like chickens waiting\nfor the ax delay the massacres a day?  But now it is 'Come and lead\nus, Kagig!'  How many of you are there left to lead?\"\n\n\"Who knows?  We are nineteen--\"\n\n\"Hah!  And I am to run with nineteen men to the rape of Tarsus\nand Adana?\"\n\n\"Our people will rally to you, Kagig!\"\n\n\"They shall.\"\n\n\"Come, then!\"\n\n\"They shall rally at Zeitoon!\"\n\n\"Oh, Kagig--how shall they reich Zeitoon? The cursed Turks have ordered\nout the soldiers and are sending regiments--\"\n\n\"I warned they would!\"\n\n\"The cavalry are hunting down fugitives along the roads!\"\n\n\"As I foretold a hundred times!\"\n\n\"They were sent to protect Armenians--\"\n\n\"That is always the excuse!\"\n\n\"And they kill--kill--kill!  A dozen of them hunted me for two miles,\nuntil I hid in a watercourse!  Look at us!  Look at our clothes!\nWe are wet to the skin--tired--starving!  Kagig, be a man!\"\n\nHe went back to his mess of blankets and sat down on it, too bitter\nat heart for words.  They reproached him in chorus, coming nearer\nto the fire to let the fierce heat draw the stink out of their clothes.\n\n\"Aye, Kagig, you must not forget your race.  You must not forget\nthe past, Kagig.  Once Armenia was great, remember that!  You must\nnot only talk to us, you must act at last!  We summon you to be our\nleader, Kagig, son of Kagig of Zeitoon!\"\n\nHe stared back at them with burning eyes--raised both bands to beat\nhis temples--and then suddenly turned the palms of his hands toward\nthe roof in a gesture of utter misery.\n\n\"Oh, my people!\"\n\nThat glimpse he betrayed of his agony was but a moment long.  The\nfingers closed suddenly, and the palms that had risen in helplessness\ndescended to his knees clenched fists, heavy with the weight of purpose.\n\n\"What have you done with the ammunition?\" he demanded.\n\n\"We had it in the manure under John Zimisces' cattle.\"\n\n\"I know that.  Where is it now?\"\n\n\"The Turks discovered it at dawn to-day.  Some one had told.  They\nburned Zimisces and his wife and sons alive in the straw!\"\n\n\"You fools!  They knew where the stuff was a week ago!  A month ago\nI warned you to send it to Zeitoon, but somebody told you I was\ntreacherous, and you fools listened!  How much ammunition have you\nleft now?\"\n\n\"Just what we have with us.  I have a dozen rounds.\"\n\n\"I ten.\"\n\n\"I nine.\"\n\n\"I thirty-three.\"\n\nEach man had a handful, or two handfuls at the most.  Kagig observed\ntheir contributions to the common fund with scorn too deep for expression.\nIt was as if the very springs of speech were frozen.\n\n\"We summon you to lead us, Kagig!\"\n\nWords came to him again.\n\n\"You summon me to lead?  I will!  From now I lead!  By the God who\ngave my fathers bread among the mountains, I will, moreover, be obeyed!\nEither my word is law--\"\n\n\"Kagig, it is law!\"\n\n\"Or back you shall go to where the Turks are wearing white, and the\ngutters bubble red, and the beams are black against the sky!  You\nshall obey me in future on the instant that I speak, or run back\nto the Turks for mercy from my hand!  I have listened to enough talk!\"\n\n\"Spoken like a man!\" said Monty, and stood up.\n\nWe all stood up;  even Rustum Khan, who did not pretend to like him,\nsaluted the old warrior who could announce his purpose so magnificently.\nMaga Jhaere stood up, and sought Will's eyes from across the room.\nFred, almost too sleepy to know what he was doing (for the tail end\nof the fever is a yearning for early bed) undid the catch of his\nbeloved instrument, and made the rafters ring.  In a minute we four\nwere singing \"For he's a jolly good fellow,\" and Kagig stood up,\nlooking like Robinson Crusoe in his goat-skins, to acknowledge the\ncompliment.\n\nThe noise awoke Peter Measel, and when we had finished making fools\nof ourselves I walked over to discover what he was saying.  He was\npraying aloud--nasally--through the mouse-hole--for us, not himself.\nI looked at my watch.  It was two hours past midnight.\n\n\"You fellows,\" I said, \"it's Sunday.  The martyred biped has just\nwaked up and remembered it.  He is praying that we may be forgiven\nfor polluting the Sabbath stillness with immoral tunes!\"\n\nMy words had a strange effect.  Monty, and Fred, and Will laughed.\nRustum Khan laughed savagely.  But all the Armenians, including Kagig,\nknelt promptly on the floor and prayed, the gipsies looking on in\nmild amusement tempered by discretion.  And out of the mouse-hole\nin the horse-feed bin came Peter Measel's sonorous, overriding periods:\n\n\"And, O Lord, let them not be smitten by Thine anger.  Let them not\nbe cut down in Thy wrath!  Let them not be cast into hell!  Give\nthem another chance, O Lord!  Let the Ten Commandments be written\non their hearts in letters of fire, but let not their souls be damned\nfor ever more!  If they did not know it was the Sabbath Day, O Lord,\nforgive them! Amen!\"\n\nIt was a most amazing night.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Seven\n \"We hold you to your word!\"\n\n\nLIBERA NOS, DOMINE!\n\nA priest, a statesman, and a soldier stood\nHand in each other's hand, by ruin faced,\nConsulting to find succor if they could,\nTill soon the lesser ones themselves abased,\nTheir sword and parchment on an altar laid\nIn deep humility the while the priest he prayed.\n\nHe prayed first for his church, that it might be\nUpholden and acknowledged and revered,\nAnd in its opal twilight men might see\nSalvation if in truth enough they feared,\nAnd if enough acknowledgment they gave\nTo ritual, and rosary, and creed that save.\n\nThen prayed he for the state, that it should wean\nWell-tutored counselors to do their part\nFull profit and prosperity to glean\nWith dignity, although with contrite heart\nAnd wisdom that Tradition wisdom ranks,\nThat church and state might stand and men give thanks.\n\nLast prayed he for the soldier--longest, too,\nThat all the honor and the aims of war\nSubserving him might carry wrath and rue\nUnto repentance, and in trembling awe\nThe enemy at length should fault confess\nAnd yield, to crave a peace of righteousness.\n\nBehind them stood a patriot unbowed,\nNot arrogant in gilt or goodly cloth,\nNor mincing meek, and yet not poorly proud;\nWith eyes afire that glittered not with wrath;\nAware of evil hours, and undismayed\nBecause he loved too well.  He also prayed.\n\n\"Oh, Thou, who gavest, may I also give,\nWithholding not--accepting no reward;\nFor I die gladly if the least ones live.\nTwice righteous and two-edged be the sword,\n'Neath freedom's banner drawn to prove Thy word\nAnd smite me if I'm false!\"  His prayer was heard.\n\n\nThe remainder of that night was nightmare pure and simple--mules\nand horses squealing in instinctive fear of action they felt\nimpending--gipsies and Armenians dragging packs out on the floor, to\nrepack everything a dozen times for some utterly godless reason--Rustum\nKhan seizing each fugitive Armenian in turn to question him, alternating\nfierce threats with persuasion--Kagig striding up and down with hands\nbehind him and his scraggly black beard pressed down on his chest--and\nthe great fire blazing with reports like cannon shots as one\nof the Turk's sons piled on fuel and the resinous wet wood caught.\n\nThe Turk and his other six sons ran away and hid themselves as a\nprecaution against our taking vengeance on them.  With situations\nreversed a Turk would have taken unbelievable toll in blood and agony\nfrom any Armenian he could find, and they reasoned we were probably\nno better than themselves.  The marvel was that they left one son\nto wait on us, and take the money for room and horse-feed.\n\n\"Remember!\" warned Monty, as we four sidled close together with our\nbacks against the wall.  \"Until we're in actual personal danger this\ntrouble is the affair of Kagig and his men!\"\n\n\"I get you.  If we horn in before we have to we'll do more harm than\ngood.  Give the Turks an excuse to call us outlaws and shoot instead\nof rescue us.  Sure.  But what about Miss Vanderman?\"  said Will.\n\n\"I foresee she's doomed!\" Fred stared straight in front of him.\n\"It looks as if we'll lose our little Willy too!  One woman at a\ntime, especially when the lady totes a mother-o'-pearl revolver and\nabout a dozen knives! If you come out of this alive, Bill, you'll\nbe wiser!\"\n\n\"Fond of bull, aren't you!  You'd jest on an ant-heap.\"\n\n\"There's nothing to discuss,\" said I.  \"If there's a lady in danger\nsomewhere ahead, we all know what we're going to do about it.\"\n\nMonty nodded.\n\n\"If we can find her and get word to the consul, that 'ud be one more\nlever for him to pull on.\"\n\n\"D'you suppose they'd dare molest an Englishwoman?\" I asked, with\nthe sudden goose-flesh rising all over me.\n\n\"She's American,\" said Will between purposely set lips.  But I did\nnot see that that qualified the unpleasantness by much.\n\nOne of the Armenians, whom Rustum Khan had finished questioning,\nwent and stood in Kagig's way, intercepting his everlasting sentry-go.\n\n\"What is it, Eflaton?\"\n\n\"My wife, Kagig!\"\n\n\"Ah!  I remember your wife.  She fed me often.\"\n\n\"You must come with me and find her, Kagig--my wife and two daughters,\nwho fed you often!\"\n\n\"The daughters were pretty,\" said Kagig.  \"So was the wife.  A young\nwoman yet.  A brave, good woman.  Always she agreed with me, I remember.\nOften I heard her urge you men to follow me to Zeitoon and help to\nfortify the place!\"\n\n\"Will you leave a good woman in the hands of Turks, Kagig?  Come--come\nto the rescue!\"\n\n\"It is too bad,\" said Kagig simply.  \"Such women suffer more terribly\nthan the hags who merely die by the sword.  Ten times by the\ncount--during ten succeeding massacres I have seen the Turks sell\nArmenian wives and daughters at auction.  I am sorry, Eflaton.\"\n\n\"My God!\" groaned Will.  \"How long are we four loafers going to sit\nhere and leave a white woman in danger on the road ahead?\"  He got\nup and began folding his blankets.\n\nThe Armenian whom Kagig had called Eflaton threw himself to the floor\nand shrieked in agony of misery.  Rustum Khan stepped over him and\ncame and stood in front of Monty.\n\n\"These men are fools,\" he said.  \"They know exactly what the Turks\nwill do.  They have all seen massacres before.  Yet not one of them\nwas ready when the hour set for this one came.  They say--and they\nsay the truth, that the Turks will murder all Europeans they catch\noutside the mission stations, lest there be true witnesses afterward\nwhom the world will believe.\"\n\n\"But a woman--scarcely a white woman?\"  This from Will, with the\ntips of his ears red and the rest of his face a deathly white.\n\n\"Depending on the woman,\" answered Rustum Khan.  \"Old--unpleasing--\"\nHe made an upward gesture with his thumb, and a noise between his\nteeth suggestive of a severed wind-pipe.  \"If she were good-looking--I\nhave heard say they pay high prices in the interior, say at Kaisarieh\nor Mosul.  Once in a harem, who would ever know?  The road ahead\nis worse than dangerous.  Whoever wishes to save his life would do\nbest to turn back now and try to ride through to Tarsus.\"\n\n\"Try it, then, if you're afraid!\" sneered Will, and for a moment\nI thought the Rajput would draw steel.\n\n\"I know what this lord sahib and I will do,\" he said, darkening three\nor four shades under his black beard.  \"It was for men bewitched\nby gipsy-women that I feared!\"\n\nWill was standing.  Nothing but Monty's voice prevented blows.  He\nrapped out a string of sudden rhetoric in the Rajput's own guttural\ntongue, and Rustum Khan drew back four paces.\n\n\"Send him back, Colonel sahib!\" he urged.  \"Send that one back!\nHe and Umm Kulsum will be the death of us!\"\n\nFred went off into a peal of laughter that did nothing to calm the\nRajput's ruffled temper.\n\n\"Who was Umm Kulsum?\" I asked him, divining the cause.\n\n\"The most immoral hag in Asian legend!  The aggregated essence of\nall female evil personified in one procuress!\"\n\n\"Say, I'll have to teach that gink--\"\n\nMonty got up and stood between them, but it was a new alarm that\nprevented blows.  A fist-blow in the Rajput's face would have meant\na blood-feud that nothing less than a man's life could settle, and\nMonty looked worried.  There came a new thundering on the door that\nbrought everybody to his feet as if murder were the least of the\ncharges against us.  Only Kagig appeared at ease and unconcerned.\n\n\"Open to them!\" he shouted, and resumed his pacing to and fro.\n\nOur Armenian servants ran to the door, and in a minute returned to\nsay that fifty mounted men from Zeitoon were drawn up outside.  Kagig\ngave a curt laugh and strode across to us.\n\n\"I said you Eenglis sportmen should see good sport.\"\n\nMonty nodded, with a hand held out behind him to warn us to keep still.\n\n\"I said you shall shoot many pigs!\"\n\n\"Lead on, then.\"\n\n\"Turks are pigs!\"\n\nMonty did not answer.  To have disagreed would have been like flapping\na red cloth at a tiger.  Yet to have agreed with him at once might\nhave made him jump to false conclusions.  The consul's last words\nto us had been insistent on the unwisdom of posing as anything but\nhunters, legitimately entitled to protection from the Turkish government.\n\n\"I would like you gentlemen for allies!\"\n\n\"You are our servant at present.\"\n\n\"Would you think of holding me to that?\" demanded Kagig with a gesture\nof extreme irritation.  It is only the West that can joke at itself\nin the face of crisis.\n\n\"If not to that,\" said Monty blandly, \"then what agreements do you keep?\"\n\nKagig saw the point. He drew a deep impatient breath and drove it\nout again hissing through his teeth.  Then he took grim hold of himself.\n\n\"Effendi,\" he said, addressing himself to Monty, but including all\nof us with eyes that seemed to search our hearts, \"you are a lord,\na friend of the King of Eengland.  If I were less than a man of my\nword I could make you prisoner and oblige your friend the King of\nEengland to squeeze these cursed Turks!\"\n\nRustum Khan heard what he said, and made noise enough drawing his\nsaber to be heard outside the kahveh, but Kagig did not turn his\nhead.  Three gipsies attended to Rustum Khan, slipping between him\nand their master, and our four Zeitoonli servants cautiously approached\nthe Rajput from behind.\n\n\"Peace!\" ordered Monty.  \"Continue, Kagig.\"\n\nKagig held both hands toward Monty, palms upward, as if he were offering\nthe keys of Hell and Heaven.\n\n\"You are sportmen, all of you.  Shall I keep my word to you?  Or\nshall I serve my nation in its agony?\"\n\nMonty glanced swiftly at us, but we made no sign.  Will actually\nlooked away.  It was a rule we four had to leave the playing of a\nhand to whichever member of the partnership was first engaged;  and\nwe never regretted it, although it often called for faith in one\nanother to the thirty-third degree.  The next hand might fall to\nany other of us, but for the present it was Monty's play.\n\n\"We hold you to your word!\" said Monty.\n\nKagig gasped.  \"But my people!\"\n\n\"Keep your word to them too!  Surely you haven't promised them to\nmake us prisoner?\"\n\n\"But if I am your servant--if I must obey you for two piasters a\nday, how shall I serve my nation?\"\n\n\"Wait and see!\" suggested Monty blandly.\n\nKagig bowed stiffly, from the neck.\n\n\"It would surprise you, effendi,\" he said grimly, \"to know how many\nlong years I have waited, in order that I may see what other men\nwill do!\"\n\nMonty never answered that remark.  There came a yell of \"Fire!\" and\nin less than ten seconds flames began to burst through the door that\nshut off the Turks' private quarters, and to lick and roar among\nthe roof beams.  The animals at the other end of the room went crazy,\nand there was instant panic, the Armenians outside trying to get\nin to help, and fighting with the men and animals and women and children\nwho choked the way.  Then the hay in the upper story caught alight,\nand the heat below became intolerable.  Monty saw and instantly pounced\non an ax and two crow-bars in the corner.\n\n\"Through the wall!\" he ordered.\n\nFred, Will and I did that work, he and Kagig looking on.  It was\nmuch easier than at first seemed likely.  Most of the stones were\nstuck with mud, not plaster, and when the first three or four were\nout the rest came easily.  In almost no time we had a great gap ready,\nand the extra draft we made increased the holocaust, but seemed to\nlift the heat higher.  Then some of the Zeitoonli saw the gap, and\nbegan to hurry blindfolded horses through it and in a very little\nwhile the place seemed empty.  I saw the Turkish owner and several\nof his sons looking on in fatalistic calm at about the outside edge\nof the ring of light, and it occurred to me to ask a question.\n\n\"Hasn't that Turk a harem?\" I asked.\n\nIn another second we four were hurrying around the building, and\nWill and I burst in the door at the rear with our crow-bars.  Monty\nand Fred rushed past us, and before I could get the smoke out of\nmy eyes and throat they were hurrying out again with two old women\nin their arms--the women screaming, and they laughing and coughing\nso that they could hardly run.  Then Will made my blood run cold\nwith a new alarm.\n\n\"The biped!\" he shouted.  \"The Measel in the corn-bin!\"\n\nThey dropped the old ladies, and all four of us raced back to our\nhole in the wall--plunged into the hell-hot building, pulled the\nlid off the corn-bin (it was fastened like an ancient Egyptian coffin-lid\nwith several stout Wooden pegs), dragged Measel out, and frog-marched\nhim, kicking and yelling, to the open, where Fred collapsed.\n\n\"Measel,\" said Will, stooping to feel Fred's heart, \"if you're the\ncause of my friend Oakes' death, Lord pity you!\"\n\nFred sat up, not that he wished to save the \"biped\" any anguish,\nbut the wise man vomits comfortably when he can, the necessity being\nbad enough without additional torment.\n\n\"See!\" said a voice out of darkness.  \"He empties himself!  That\nis well.  It is only the end of the fever.  Now he will be a man\nagain.  But the sahibs should have left that writer of characters\nin the corn-bin, where he could have shared the fate of his master\nwithout troubling us again!\"\n\nRustum Khan strode into the light, with half his fierce beard burned\naway from having been the last to leave by the front entrance, and\na decided limp from having been kicked by a frantic mule.\n\n\"What have you done with the German?\" demanded Monty.\n\n\"I, sahib?  Nothing.  In truth nothing.  It was the seven sons of\nthe Turk--abetted I should say by gipsies.  It was the German who\nset the place alight.  The girl, Maga Jhaere they call her, saw him\ndo it.  She watched like a cat, the fool, hoping to amuse herself,\nwhile he burned off his ropes with a brand that fell his way out\nof the fire.  When another brand jumped half across the room he set\nthe place alight with it, tossing it over the party wall.  He was\nan able rascal, sahib.\"\n\n\"Was?\" demanded Monty.\n\n\"Aye, sahib, was!  In another second he released the Turkish lieutenant\nand shouted in his ear to escape and say that Armenians burned this\nkahveh!  Gregor Jhaere slew the Turk, however.  And Maga followed\nthe German into the open, where she denounced him to some of the\nZeitoonli who recently arrived.  They took him and threw him back\ninto the fire--where he remained.  I begin to like these Zeitoonli.\nI even like the gipsies more than formerly.  They are men of some\ndiscernment, and of action!\"\n\n\"Man of blood!\" growled Monty.  \"What of the Turkish owner and his\nseven sons?\"\n\n\"They shall burn, too, if the sahib say so!\"\n\n\"If they burn, so shall you!  Where is Kagig?\"\n\n\"Seeing that the sahibs' horses are packed and saddled.  I came to\nfind the sahibs.  According to Kagig it is time to go, before Turks\ncome to take vengeance for a burned road-house.  They will surely\nsay Armenians burned it, whether or not there is a German to support\ntheir accusation!\"\n\nThen we heard Kagig's high-pitched \"Haide--chabuk!\" and picked up\nPeter Measel, and ran around the building to where the horses were\nalready saddled, and squealing in fear of the flames.  We left the\nTurk, and his wives and seven sons, to tell what tale they pleased.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Eight\n\"I go with that man!\"\n\n\nLO HERE!  LO THERE!\n\nYe shall not judge men by the drinks they take,\nNor by unthinking oath, nor what they wear,\nFor look! the mitered liars protest make\nAnd drinking know they lie, and knowing swear.\nNo oath is round without the rounded fruit,\nNor pompous promise hides the ultimate.\nIn scarlet as in overalls and tailored suit\nTo-morrows truemen and the traitors wait\nUntold by trick of blazonry or voice.\nBut harvest ripens and there come the reaping days\nWhen each shall choose one path to bide the choice,\nAnd ye shall know men when they face dividing ways.\n\n\nTo those who have never ridden knee to knee with outlaws full pelt\ninto unknown darkness, with a burning house behind, and a whole horizon\nlit with the rolling glow of murdered villages, let it be written\nthat the sensation of so doing is creepy, most amazing wild, and\nnot without unrighteous pleasure.\n\nThere was a fierce joy that burned without consuming, and a consciousness\nof having crossed a rubicon.  Points of view are left behind in a\nmoment, although the proof may not be apparent for days or weeks,\nand I reckon our mental change from being merely hunters of an ancient\ncastle and big game-tourists-trippers, from that hour.  As we galloped\nbehind Kagig the mesmerism of respect for custom blew away in the\nwind.  We became at heart outlaws as we rode--and one of us a privy\ncouncilor of England!\n\nThe women, Maga included, were on in front.  The night around and\nbehind us was full of the thunder of fleeing cattle, for the Zeitoonli\nhad looted the owner of the kahveh's cows and oxen along with their\nown beasts and were driving them helter-skelter.  The crackling flames\nbehind us were a beacon, whistling white in the early wind, that\nwe did well to hurry from.\n\nIt was Monty who called Kagig's attention to the idiocy of tiring\nout the cattle before dawn, and then Kagig rode like an arrow until\nhe could make the gipsies hear him.  One long keening shout that\npenetrated through the drum of hoofs brought them to a walk, but\nthey kept Maga in front with them, screened from our view until\nmorning by a close line of mounted women and a group of men.  The\nTurkish prisoners were all behind among the fifty Armenians from\nZeitoon, looking very comfortless trussed up on the mounts that nobody\nelse had coveted, with hands made fast behind their backs.\n\nA little before dawn, when the saw-tooth tips of the mountain range\non our left were first touched with opal and gold, we turned off\nthe araba track along which we had so far come and entered a ravine\nleading toward Marash.  Fred was asleep on horseback, supported between\nWill and me and snoring like a throttled dog.  The smoke of the gutted\nkahveh had dwindled to a wisp in the distance behind us, and there\nwas no sight or sound of pursuit.\n\nNo wheeled vehicle that ever man made could have passed up this\nnew track.  It was difficult for ridden horses, and our loaded beasts\nhad to be given time.  We seemed to be entering by a fissure into\nthe womb of the savage hills that tossed themselves in ever-increasing\ngrandeur up toward the mist-draped heights of Kara Dagh.  Oftener\nthan not our track was obviously watercourse, although now and then\nwe breasted higher levels from which we could see, through gaps between\nhill and forest, backward along the way we had come.  There was smoke\nfrom the direction of Adana that smudged a whole sky-line, and between\nthat and the sea about a dozen sooty columns mushroomed against the\nclouds.\n\nThere was not a mile of the way we came that did not hold a hundred\nhiding-places fit for ambuscade, but our party was too numerous and\nwell-armed to need worry on that account.  Monty and Kagig drew ahead,\nquite a little way behind the gipsies still, but far in front of us,\nwho had to keep Fred upright on his horse.\n\n\"My particular need is breakfast,\" said I.\n\n\"And Will's is the woman!\" said Fred, admitting himself awake at last.\nWill had been straining in the stirrups on the top of every rise his\nhorse negotiated ever since the sun rose.  It certainly was a mystery\nwhy Maga should have been spirited away, after the freedom permitted\nher the day before.\n\n\"Rustum Khan has probably made off with her, or cut her head off!\"\nremarked Fred by way of offering comfort, yawning with the conscious\nluxury of having slept.  \"I don't see Rustum Khan.  Let's hope it's\ntrue!  That 'ud give the American lady a better chance for her life\nin case we should overtake her!\"\n\nWill and Fred have always chosen the most awkward places and the\nleast excuse for horseplay, and the sleep seemed to have expelled\nthe last of the fever from Fred's bones, so that he felt like a schoolboy\non holiday.  Will grabbed him around the neck and they wrestled,\nto their horses' infinite disgust, panting and straining mightily\nin the effort to unseat each other.  It was natural that Will should\nhave the best of it, he being about fifteen years younger as well\nas unweakened by malaria.  The men of Zeitoon behind us checked to\nwatch Fred rolled out of his saddle, and roared with the delight\nof fighting men the wide world over to see the older campaigner suddenly\nrecover his balance and turn the tables on the younger by a trick.\n\nAnd at that very second, as Will landed feet first on the gravel\npanting for breath, Maga Jhaere arrived full gallop from the rear,\nmanaging her ugly gray stallion with consummate ease.  Her black\nhair streamed out in the wind, and what with the dew on it and the\nslanting sun-rays she seemed to be wearing all the gorgeous jewels\nout of Ali Baba's cave.  She was the loveliest thing to look\nat--unaffected, unexpected, and as untamed as the dawn, with parted\nlips as red as the branch of budding leaves with which she beat\nher horse.\n\nBut the smile turned to a frown of sudden passion as she saw Will\nland on the ground and Fred get ready for reprisals.  She screamed\ndefiance--burst through the ranks of the nearest Zeitoonli--set her\nstallion straight at us--burst between Fred and me--beat Fred savagely\nacross the face with her sap-softened branch--and wheeled on her\nbeast's haunches to make much of Will.  He laughed at her, and tried\nto take the whip away.  Seeing he was neither hurt nor indignant,\nshe laughed at Fred, spat at him, and whipped her stallion forward\nin pursuit of Kagig, breaking between him and Monty to pour news\nin his ear.\n\n\"A curse on Rustum Khan!\" laughed Fred, spitting out red buds.  \"He\ndidn't do his duty!\"\n\nHe had hardly said that when the Rajput came spurring and thundering\nalong from the rear.  He seemed in no hurry to follow farther, but\ndrew rein between us and saluted with the semi-military gesture with\nwhich he favored all who, unlike Monty, had not been Colonels of\nIndian regiments.\n\n\"I tracked Umm Kulsum through the dark!\" he announced, rubbing the\nburned nodules out of his singed beard and then patting his mare's\nneck.  \"I saw her ride away alone an hour before you reached that\nfork in the road and turned up this watercourse.  'By the teeth of\nGod,' said I, 'when a good-looking woman leaves a party of men to\ncanter alone in the dark, there is treason!' and I followed.\"\n\nI offered the Rajput my cigarette case, and to my surprise he accepted\none, although not without visible compunction.  As a Muhammadan by\ncreed he was in theory without caste and not to be defiled by European\ntouch, but the practises of most folk fall behind their professions.\nA hundred yards ahead of us Maga was talking and gesticulating furiously,\nevidently railing at Kagig's wooden-headedness or unbelief.  Monty\nsat listening, saying nothing.\n\n\"What did you see, Rustum Khan?\" asked Fred.\n\n\"At first very little.  My eyes are good, but that gipsy-woman's\nare better, and I was kept busy following her;  for I could not keep\nclose, or she might have heard.  The noise of her own clumsy stallion\nprevented her from hearing the lighter footfalls of my mare, and\nby that I made sure she was not expecting to meet an enemy.  'She\nrides to betray us to her friends!' said I, and I kept yet farther\nbehind her, on the alert against ambush.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"She rode until dawn, I following.  Then, when the light was scarcely\nborn as yet, she suddenly drew rein at an open place where the track\nshe had been following emerged out of dense bushes, and dismounted.\nFrom behind the bushes I watched, and presently I, too, dismounted\nto hold my mare's nostrils and prevent her from whinnying.  That\nwoman, Maga Jhaere, knelt, and pawed about the ground like a dog\nthat hunts a buried bone!\"\n\nIn front of us Maga was still arguing. Suddenly Kagig turned on her\nand asked her three swift questions, bitten off like the snap of\na closing snuff-box lid.  Whether she answered or not I could not\nsee, but Monty was smiling.\n\n\"I suspect she was making signals!\" growled Rustum Khan.  \"To\nwhom--about what I do not know.  After a little while she mounted and\nrode on, choosing unerringly a new track through the bushes.  I went\nto where she had been, and examined the ground where she had made\nher signals.  As I say, my eyes are good, but hers are better.  I\ncould see nothing but the hoof-marks of her clumsy gray brute of\na stallion, and in one place the depressions on soft earth where\nshe had knelt to paw the ground!\"\n\nMonty was beginning to talk now.  I could see him smiling at Kagig\nover Maga's head, and the girl was growing angry.  Rustum Khan was\nwatching them as closely as we were, pausing between sentences.\n\n\"It may be she buried something there, but if so I did not find it.\nI could not stay long, for when she rode away she went like wind,\nand I needed to follow at top speed or else be lost.  So I let my\nmare feel the spurs a time or two, and so it happened that I gained\non the woman;  and I suppose she heard me.  Whether or no, she waited\nin ambush, and sprang out at me as I passed so suddenly that I know\nnot what god of fools and drunkards preserved her from being cut\ndown!  Not many have ridden out at me from ambush and lived to tell\nof it!  But I saw who she was in time, and sheathed my steel again,\nand cursed her for the gipsy that she half is.  The other half is\nspawn of Eblis!\"\n\nA hundred yards ahead of us Kagig had reached a decision, but it\nseemed to be not too late yet in Maga's judgment to try to convert\nhim.  She was speaking vehemently, passionately, throwing down her\nreins to expostulate with both hands.\n\n\"Kagig isn't the man you'd think a young woman would choose to be\nfamiliar with,\" Fred said quietly to me, and I wondered what he was\ndriving at.  He is always observant behind that superficial air of\nmockery he chooses to assume, but what he had noticed to set him\nthinking I could not guess.\n\nRustum Khan threw away the cigarette I had given him, and went on\nwith his tale.\n\n\"That woman has no virtue.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" demanded Will.\n\n\"She laughed when I cursed her!  Then she asked me what I had seen.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\n\"To test her I said I had seen her lover, and would know him again\nby his smell in the dark!\"\n\n\"What did she say to that?'\n\n\"She laughed again.  I tell you the woman has no shame!  Then she\nsaid if I would tell that tale to Kagig as soon as I see him she\nwould reward me with leave to live for one whole week and an extra\nhour in which to pray to the devil----meaning, I suppose, that she\nintends to kill me otherwise.  Then she wheeled her stallion--the\nbrute was trying to tear out the muscles of my thigh all that time--and\nrode away--and I followed--and here I am!\"\n\n\"How much truth is there in your assertion that you saw her lover?\"\nWill demanded.\n\n\"None.  I but said it to test her.\"\n\n\"Why in thunder should she want it believed?\"\n\n\"God knows, who made gipsies!\"\n\nAt that moment the advance-guard rode into an open meadow, crossed\nby a shallow, singing stream at which Kagig ordered a halt to water\nhorses.  So we closed up with him, and he repeated to us what he\nhad evidently said before to Monty.\n\n\"Maga says--I let her go scouting--she says she met a man who told\nher that Miss Gloria Vanderman and a party of seven were attacked\non the road, but escaped, and now have doubled on their tracks so\nthat they are far on their return to Tarsus.\"\n\nRustum Khan met Monty's eyes, and his lips moved silently.\n\n\"What do you know, sirdar?\" Monty asked him.\n\n\"The woman lies!\"\n\nMaga was glaring at Rustum Khan as a leopardess eyes an enemy.  As\nhe spoke she made a significant gesture with a finger across her\nthroat, which the Rajput, if he saw, ignored.\n\n\"To what extent?\" demanded Kagig calmly.\n\n\"Wholly!  I followed her.  She met no man, although she pawed the\nground at a place where eight ridden horses had crossed soft ground\na day ago.\"\n\nKagig nodded, recognizing truth--a rather rare gift.\n\nIf the Rajput's guess was wrong and Maga did know shame, at any rate\nshe did not choose that moment to betray it.\n\n\"Oh, very well!\" she sneered.  \"There were eight horses.  They were\ngalloping.  The track was nine hours old.\"\n\nKagig nodded without any symptom of annoyance or reproach.\n\n\"There is an ancient castle in the hills up yonder,\" he said, \"in\nwhich there may be many Armenians hiding.\"\n\nHe took it for granted we would go and find out, and Maga recognized\nthe drift.\n\n\"Very well,\" she said.  \"Let that one go, and that one,\" pointing\nat Fred and me.\n\n\"You'll appreciate, of course,\" said Monty, \"that it's out of the\nquestion for us to go forward until we know where that lady is.\"\n\nKagig bowed gravely.\n\n\"I am needed at Zeitoon,\" he answered.\n\nThen Maga broke in shrilly, pointing at Will:\n\n\"Take that one for hostage!\" she advised.  \"Bring him along to Zeitoon.\nThen the rest will follow!\"\n\nKagig looked gravely at her.\n\n\"I shall take this one,\" he answered, laying a respectful hand on\nMonty's sleeve.  \"Effendi, you are an Eenglis lord.  Be your life\nand comfort on my head, but I need a hostage for my nation's sake.\nYou others--I admit the urgency--shall hunt the missionary lady.\nIf I have this one\"--again he touched Monty--\"I know well you will\ncome seeking him!  You, effendi, you understand my--necessity?\"\n\nMonty nodded, smiling gravely.  There was a fire at the back of Monty's\neyes and something in his bearing I had never seen before.\n\n\"Then I go with my colonel sahib!\" announced Rustum Khan.  \"That\ngipsy woman will kill him otherwise!\"\n\n\"Better help hunt for the lady, Rustum Khan.\"\n\n\"Nay, colonel sahib bahadur--thy blood on my head!  I go with thee--into\nhell and out beyond if need be!\"\n\n\"You fellows agreeable?\" asked Monty.  \"There is no disputing Kagig's\ndecision.  We're at his mercy.\"\n\n\"We've got to find Miss Vanderman!\" said Will.\n\n\"You are not at my mercy, effendi,\" grumbled Kagig.  The man was\nobviously distressed.  \"You are rather at my discretion.  I am\nresponsible.  For my nation's sake and for my honor I dare not lose\nyou.  Who has not seen how a cow will follow the calf in a wagon?\nSo in your case, if I hold the one--the chief one--the noble one--the\nlord--the cousin of the Eenglis king\"  (Monty's rank was mounting\nlike mercury in a tube as Kagig warmed to the argument)--\"you others\nwill certainly hunt him up-hill and down-dale.  Thus will my honor\nand my country's cause both profit!\"\n\nMonty smiled benignantly.\n\n\"It's all one, Kagig.  Why labor the point?  I'm going with you.\nRustum Khan prefers to come with me.\"  Kagig looked askance at Rustum\nKhan, but made no comment.  \"One hostage is enough for your purpose.\nLet me talk with my friends a minute.\"\n\nKagig nodded, and we four drew aside.\n\n\"Now,\" demanded Fred, who knew the signs, \"what special quixotry\ndo you mean springing?\"\n\n\"Shut up, Fred.  There's no need for you fellows to follow Kagig\nanother yard.  He'll be quite satisfied if he has me in keeping.\nThat will serve all practical purposes.  What you three must do is\nfind Miss Vanderman if you can, and take her back to Tarsus.  There\nyou can help the consul bring pressure to bear on the authorities.\"\n\n\"Rot!\" retorted Fred.  \"Didums, you're drunk.  Where did you get\nthe drink?\"\n\nMonty smiled, for he held a card that could out-trump our best one,\nand he knew it.  In fact he led it straight away.\n\n\"D'you mean to say you'd consider it decent to find that young woman\nin the mountains and drag her to Zeitoon at Kagig's tail, when Tarsus\nis not more than three days' ride away at most?  You know the Turks\nwouldn't dare touch you on the road to the coast.\"\n\n\"For that matter,\" said Fred, \"the Turks 'ud hardly dare touch Miss\nVanderman herself.\"\n\n\"Then leave her in the hills!\" grinned Monty.  \"Kagig tells me that\nthe Kurds are riding down in hundreds from Kaisarich way.  He says\nthey'll arrive too late to loot the cities, but they're experts at\nhunting along the mountain range.  Why not leave the lady to the\ntender ministrations of the Kurds!\"\n\n\"One 'ud think you and Kagig knew of buried treasure!  Or has he\npromised to make you Duke of Zeitoon?\" asked Will.  \"Tisn't right,\nMonty.  You've no call to force our band in this way.\"\n\n\"Name a better way,\" said Monty.\n\nNone of us could.  The proposal was perfectly logical.\n\nThree of us, even supposing Kagig should care to lend us some of\nhis Zeitoonli horsemen, would be all too few for the rescue work.\nCertainly we could not leave a lady unprotected in these hills, with\nthe threat of plundering Kurds overhanging.  If we found her we could\nhardly carry her off up-country if there were any safer course.\n\n\"Time--time is swift!\" said Kagig, pulling out a watch like a big\nbrass turnip and shaking it, presumably to encourage the mechanism.\n\n\"The fact is,\" said Monty, drawing us farther aside, for Rustum Khan\nwas growing restive and inquisitive, \"I've not much faith in Kagig's\nprospects at Zeitoon.  He has talked to me all along the road, and\nI don't believe he bases much reliance on his men.  He counts more\non holding me as hostage and so obliging the Turkish government to\ncall off its murderers.  If you men can rescue that lady in the hills\nand return to Tarsus you can serve Kagig best and give me my best\nchance too.  Hurry back and help the consul raise Cain!\"\n\nThat closed the arguments, because Maga Jhaere slipped past Kagig\nand approached us with the obvious intention of listening.  She\nhad discovered a knowledge of English scarcely perfect but astonishingly\ncomprehensive, which she had chosen to keep to herself when we first\nmet--a regular gipsy trick.  Fred threw down the gauntlet to her,\nuncovering depths of distrust that we others had never suspected\nunder his air of being amused.\n\n\"Now, miss!\" he said, striding up to her.  \"Let us understand each\nother!  This is my friend.\" He pointed to Monty.  \"If harm comes\nto him that you could have prevented, you shall pay!\"\n\nMaga tossed back her loose coils of hair and laughed.\n\n\"Never fear, sahib!\" Rustum Khan called out.  \"If ought should happen\nto my Colonel sahib that Umm Kulsum shall be first to die.  The\nwomen shall tell of her death for a generation, to frighten naughty\nchildren!\"\n\n\"You hear that?\" demanded Fred.\n\nMaga laughed again, and swore in some outlandish tongue.\n\n\"I hear!  And you hear this, you old--\" She called Fred by a name\nthat would make the butchers wince in the abattoirs at Liverpool.\n\"If anything happens to that man,--she pointed to Will, and her\neyes blazed with lawless pleasure in his evident discomfort--\"I\nmyself--me--this woman--I alone will keel--keel--keel--torture first\nand afterwards keel your friend 'at you call Monty!  I am Maga!  You\nhave heard me say what I will do!  As for that Rustum Khan--you\nshall never see him no more ever!\"\n\nKagig pulled out the enormous watch again.  He seemed oblivious of\nMaga's threats--not even aware that she had spoken, although she\nwas hissing through impudent dazzling teeth within three yards of him.\n\n\"The time,\" he said, \"has fleed--has fled--has flown.  Now we must\ngo, effendi!\"\n\n\"I go with that man!\" announced Maga, pointing at Will, but obviously\nwell aware that nothing of the kind would be permitted.\n\n\"Maga, come!\" said Kagig, and got on his horse.  \"You gentlemen may\ntake with you each one Zeitoonli servant.  No, no more.  No, the\nammunition in your pockets must suffice.  Yes, I know the remainder\nis yours;  come then to Zeitoon and get it!  Haide--Haide!  Mount!\nRide!  Haide, Zeitoonli!  To Zeitoon!  Chabuk!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter Nine\n\"And you left your friend to help me?\"\n\n\nWITH NEW TONGUES\n\nOh, bard of Avon, thou whose measured muse\nMost sweetly sings Elizabethan views\nTo shame ungentle smiths of journalese\nWith thy sublimest verse, what words are these\nThat shine amid the lines like jewels set\nBut ere thine hour no bard had chosen yet?\nDidst thou in masterly disdain of too much law\nNot only limn the truths no others saw\nBut also, lord not slave of written word,\nLend ear to what no other poet heard\nAnd, liberal minded on the Mermaid bench\nWith bow for blade and chaff for serving wench\nAwait from overseas slang-slinging Jack\nWho brought the new vocabulary back?\n\n\nSo we three stood still in a row disconsolate, with three ragged\nmen of Zeitoon holding our horses and theirs, and watched Monty ride\naway in the midst of Kagig's motley command, he not turning to wave\nback to us because he did not like the parting any better than we\ndid, although he had pretended to be all in favor of it.\n\nKagig had left us one mule for our luggage, and the beast was unlikely\nto be overburdened, for at the last minute he had turned surly, and\nas he sat like a general of division to watch his patch-and-string\ncommand go by he showed how Eye of Zeitoon only failed him for a\ntitle in giving his other eye--the one he kept on us--too little\ncredit.  It was a good-looking crowd of irregulars that he reviewed,\nand every bearded, goat-skin clad veteran in it had a word to say\nto him, and he an answer--sometimes a sermon by way of answer.  But\nhe saw every item that we removed from the common packs, and sternly\nreproved us when we tried to exceed what he considered reasonable.\nAt that he based our probable requirements on what would have been\nsurfeit of encumbrance for himself.\n\n\"Empty your pockets, effendim!\" he ordered at last.  \"Six cartridges\neach for rifle, and six each for pistol must be all.  Your cartridges\nI know they are.  But my people are in extremity!\"\n\nWhen he rode away at last, sitting his horse in the fashion of a\nDon Cossack and shepherding Maga in front of him because she kept\nchecking her gray stallion for another look at Will, he left us no\nalternative than to take to the mountains swiftly unless we cared\nto starve.  We watched Monty's back disappear over a rise, with Rustum\nKhan close behind, and then Fred signed to one of the three Zeitoonli\nto lead on.\n\nAll three of the men Kagig had left with us were surly, mainly, no\ndoubt, because they disliked separation from their friends.  But\nthere was fear, too, expressed in their manner of riding close together,\nand in the fidgety way in which they watched the smoke of burning\nArmenian villages that smudged the sky to our left.\n\n\"If they try to bolt after Kagig and leave us in the lurch I'm going\nto waste exactly one cartridge as a warning,\" Fred announced.\n\"After that--!\"\n\n\"Probably Kagig 'ud skin them if they turned up without us,\"\nremarked Will.\n\nThere was something in that theory, for we learned later what Kagig's\nferocity could be when driven hard enough.  But from first to last\nthose men of Zeitoon never showed a symptom of treachery, although\ntheir resentment at having to turn their backs toward home appeared\nto deepen hourly.\n\nWith strange unreason they made no haste, whereas we were in a frenzy\nof impatience;  and when Fred sought to improve their temper by singing\nthe songs that had hitherto acted like charms on Kagig's whole command,\nthey turned in their saddles and cursed him for calling attention to us.\n\n\"Inch goozek?\" demanded one of them (What would you like?), and with\na gesture that made the blood run cold he suggested the choice between\nhanging and disembowelment.\n\nWill solved the speed problem by striving to push past them along\nthe narrow track;  and they were so determined to keep in front of\nus that within half an hour from the start our horses were sweating\nfreely.  Then we began to climb, dismounting presently to lead our\nhorses, and all notions of speed went the way of other vanity.\n\nSeveral times looking back toward our right hand we caught sight\nof Kagig's string threading its way over a rise, or passing like\na line of ants under the brow of a gravel bank.  But they were too\nfar away to discern which of the moving specks might be Monty, although\nKagig was now and then unmistakable, his air of authority growing\non him and distinguishing him as long as he kept in sight.\n\nWe saw nothing of the footprints in soft earth that Maga had read\nso offhandedly.  In fact we took another way, less cluttered up with\nroots and bushes, that led not straight, but persistently toward an\nup-towering crag like an eye-tooth.  Below it was thick forest, shaped\nlike a shovel beard, and the crag stuck above the beard like an old\nman's last tooth.\n\nBut mountains have a discouraging way of folding and refolding so\nthat the air-line from point to point bears no relation to the length\nof the trail.  The last kites were drooping lazily toward their perches\nfor the night when we drew near the edge of the forest at last, and\nwere suddenly brought to a halt by a challenge from overhead.  We\ncould see nobody.  Only a hoarse voice warned us that it was death\nto advance another yard, and our tired animals needed no persuasion\nto stand still.\n\nThere, under a protruding lock as it were of the beard, we waited\nin shadow while an invisible somebody, whose rifle scraped rather\nnoisily against a branch, eyed every inch of us at his leisure.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he demanded at last in Armenian, and one of our three\nmen enlightened him in long-drawn detail.\n\nThe explanation did not satisfy.  We were told to remain exactly\nwhere we were until somebody else was fetched.  After twenty minutes,\nwhen it was already pitch-dark, we heard the breaking of twigs, and\nlow voices as three or four men descended together among the trees.\nThen we were examined again from close quarters in the dark, and\nthere are few less agreeable sensations.  The goose-flesh rises and\nthe clammy cold sweat takes all the comfort out of waning courage.\n\nBut somebody among the shadowy tree-trunks at last seemed to think\nhe recognized familiar attitudes, and asked again who we might be.\nAnd, weary of explanations that only achieved delay our man lumped\nus all in one invoice and snarled irritably:\n\n\"These are Americans!\"\n\nThe famous \"Open sesame\" that unlocked Ali Baba's cave never worked\nswifter then.  Reckless of possible traps no less than five men flung\nthemselves out of Cimmerian gloom and seized us in welcoming arms.\nI was lifted from the saddle by a man six inches shorter than myself,\nwhose arms could have crushed me like an insect.\n\n\"We might have known Americans would bring us help!\" he panted in\nmy ear.  His breath came short not from effort, but excitement.\n\nFred was in like predicament.  I could just see his shadow struggling\nin the embrace of an enthusiastic host, and somewhere out of sight\nWill was answering in nasal indubitable Yankee the questions of three\nother men.\n\n\"This way!  Come this way!  Bring the horses, oh, Zeitoonli!  Americans!\nAmericans!  God heard us--there have come Americans!\"\n\nThreading this and that way among tree-trunks that to our unaccustomed\neyes were simply slightly denser blots on blackness, Will managed\nto get between Fred and me.\n\n\"We're all of us Yankees this trip!\" he whispered, and I knew he\nwas grinning, enjoying it hugely.  So often he had been taken for\nan Englishman because of partnership with us that he had almost ceased\nto mind;  but he spared himself none of the amusement to be drawn\nout of the new turn of affairs, nor us any of the chaff that we had\nnever spared him.\n\n\"Take my advice,\" he said, \"and try to act you're Yanks for all you've\ngot.  If you can make blind men believe it, you may get out of this\nwith whole skins!\"\n\nI expected the retort discourteous to that from Fred, who was between\nWill and me, shepherded like us by hard-breathing, unseen men.  But\nhe was much too subtly skilful in piercing the chain-mail of Will's\nhumor--even in that hour.\n\n\"Sure!\" he answered.  \"I guess any gosh-durned rube in these parts\n'll know without being told what neck o' the woods I hail from.\nSchenectady's my middle name!  I'm--\"\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" groaned Will.  \"We don't talk that way in the States.\nThe missionaries--\"\n\n\"I'm the guy who put the 'oh!' in Ohio!\" continued Fred.  \"I'm running\nmate to Colonel Cody, and I've ridden herd on half the cows in Hocuspocus\nCounty, Wis.!  I can sing The Star-Spangled Banner with my head under\nwater, and eat a chain of frankforts two links a minute!  I'm the\nriproaring original two-gun man from Tabascoville, and any gink who\ndoubts it has no time to say his prayers!\"\n\nThere were paragraphs more of it, delivered at uneven intervals between\ndeep gasps for breath as we made unsteady progress up-hill among\nroots and rocks left purposely for the confusion of an enemy.  At\nfirst it filled Will with despair that set me laughing at him.  Then\nWill threw seriousness to the winds and laughed too, so that the\nspell of impending evil, caused as much as anything by forced separation\nfrom Monty, was broken.\n\nBut it did better than put us in rising spirits.  It convinced the\nArmenians!  That foolish jargon, picked up from comic papers and\nthe penny dreadfuls, convince more firmly than any written proof\nthe products of the mission schools, whose one ambition was to be\nAmerican themselves, and whose one pathetic peak of humor was the\noccasional glimpse of United States slang dropped for their edification\nby missionary teachers!\n\n\"By jimminy!\" remarked an Armenian near me.\n\n\"Gosh-all-hemlocks!\" said another.\n\nThenceforward nothing undermined their faith in us.  Plenty of amused\nrepudiation was very soon forthcoming from another source, but it\npassed over their heads.  Fred and I, because we used fool expressions\nwithout relation to the context or proportion, were established as\nthe genuine article;  Will, perhaps a rather doubtful quantity with\nhis conservative grammar and quiet speech, was accepted for our sakes.\nThey took an arm on either side of us to help us up the hill, and\nin proof of heart-to-heart esteem shouted \"Oopsidaisy!\" when we stumbled\nin the pitchy dark.  When we were brought to a stand at last by a\nsnarled challenge and the click of rifles overhead, they answered\nwith the chorus of Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay, a classic that ought to have\ndied an unnatural death almost a quarter of a century before.\n\nSuddenly we smelt Standard oil, and a man emerged through a gap in\nancient masonry less than six feet away carrying a battered, cheap\n\"hurricane\" lantern whose cracked glass had been reenforced with\npatches of brown paper.  He was armed to the teeth--literally.  He\nhad a long knife in his mouth, a pistol in his left hand, and a rifle\nslung behind him, but after one long look at us, holding the lantern\nto each face in turn, he suddenly discarded all appearances of ferocity.\n\n\"You know about pistols?\" he demanded of me in English, because I\nwas nearest, and thrust his Mauser repeater under my nose.  \"Why\nwon't this one work?  I have tried it every way.\"\n\n\"Lordy!\" remarked Will.\n\n\"Lead on in!\" I suggested.  Then, remembering my new part, \"It'll\nhave to be some defect if one of us can't fix it!\"\n\nThe gap-guard purred approval and swung his lantern by way of invitation\nto follow him as he turned on a naked heel and led the way.  We entered\none at a time through a hole in the wall of what looked like the\ndungeon of an ancient castle, and followed him presently up the narrow\nstone steps leading to a trap-door in the floor above.  The trap-door\nwas made of odds and ends of planking held in place by weights.\nWhen he knocked on it with the muzzle of his rifle we could hear\nmen lifting things before they could open it.\n\nWhen a gap appeared overhead at last there was no blaze of light\nto make us blink, but a row of heads at each edge of the hole with\nnothing but another lantern somewhere in the gloom behind them.\nOne by one we went up and they made way for us, closing in each time\nto scan the next-comer's face;  and when we were all up they laid\nthe planks again, and piled heavy stones in place.  Then an old man\nlighted another lantern, using no match, although there was a box\nof them beside him on the floor, but transferring flame patiently\nwith a blade of dry grass.  Somebody else lit a torch of resinous\nwood that gave a good blaze but smoked abominably.\n\n\"What has become of our horses?\" demanded Fred, looking swiftly\nabout him.\n\nWe were in a great, dim stone-walled room whose roof showed a corner\nof star-lit sky in one place.  There were twenty men surrounding\nus, but no woman.  Two trade-blankets sewn together with string hanging\nover an opening in the wall at the far end of the room suggested,\nnevertheless, that the other sex might be within ear-shot.\n\n\"The horses?\" Fred demanded again, a bit peremptorily.\n\nOne of the men who had met us smirked and made apologetic motions\nwith his hands.\n\n\"They will be attended to, effendi--\"\n\n\"I know it!  I guarantee it!  By the ace of brute force, if a horse\nis missing--!  Arabaiji!\"\n\nOne of our three Zeitoonli stepped forward.\n\n\"Take the other two men, Arabaiji, and go down to the horses.  Groom\nthem.  Feed them.  If any one prevents you, return and tell me.\"\nThen he turned to our hosts.  \"Some natives of Somaliland once ate\nmy horse for supper, but I learned that lesson.  So did they!  I\ntrust I needn't be severe with you!\"\n\nThere was no furniture in the room, except a mat at one corner.\nThey were standing all about us, and perfectly able to murder us\nif so disposed, but none made any effort to restrain our Zeitoonli.\n\n\"Now we're three to their twenty!\" I whispered, and Will nodded.\nBut Fred carried matters with a high hand.\n\n\"Send a man down with them to show them where the horses are, please!\"\n\nThere seemed to be nobody in command, but evidently one man was least\nof all, for they all began at once to order him below, and he went,\ngrumbling.\n\n\"You see, effendi, we have no meat at all,\" said the man who had\nspoken first.\n\n\"But you don't look hungry,\" asserted Fred.\n\nThey were a ragged crowd, unshaven and not too clean, with the usual\nair of men whose only clothes are on their backs and have been there\nfor a week past.  All sorts of clothes they wore--odds and ends for\nthe most part, probably snatched and pulled on in the first moment\nof a night alarm.\n\n\"Not yet, effendi.  But we have no meat, and soon we shall have eaten\nall the grain.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Fred, \"if you need horse-meat, gosh durn you, take it\nfrom the Turks!\"\n\n\"Gosh durn you!\" grinned three or four men, nudging one another.\n\nThey were lost between a furtive habit born of hiding for dear life,\na desire to be extremely friendly, and a new suspicion of Fred's\nhigh hand.  Fred's next words added disconcertment.\n\n\"Where is Miss Vanderman?\" he demanded, suddenly.\n\nBefore any one had time to answer Will made a swift move to the wall,\nand took his stand where nobody could get behind him.  He did not\nproduce his pistol, but there was that in his eye that suggested\nit.  I followed suit, so that in the event of trouble we stood a\nfair chance of protecting Fred.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked three Armenians together.\n\n\"Did you never see men try to cover a secret before?\" Will whispered.\n\n\"Or give it away?\" I added.  Six of the men placed themselves between\nFred and the opening where the blankets hung, ostentatiously not\nlooking at the blankets.\n\n\"Have you an American lady with you?\" Fred asked, and as he spoke\nhe reached a hand behind him.  But it was not his pistol that he drew.\nHe carries his concertina slung to him by a strap with the care that\nsome men lavish on a camera.  He took it in both hands, and loosed\nthe catch.\n\n\"Have you an American lady named Miss Vanderman with you?\" he repeated.\n\n\"Effendi, we do not understand.\"\n\nHe repeated in Armenian, and then in Turkish, but they shook their\nheads.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said, \"I'll soon find out.  A mission-school pupil\nmight sing My Country, 'Tis of Thee or Suwannee River or Poor Blind\nJoe.  You know Poor Blind Joe, eh?  Sung it in school?  I thought\nso.  I'll bet you don't know this one.\"\n\nHe filled his impudent instrument with wind and forthwith the belly\nof that ancient castle rang to the strains of a tune no missionaries\nsing, although no doubt the missionary ladies are familiar with it\nyet from where the Arctic night shuts down on Behring Sea to the\nSolomon Islands and beyond--a song that achieved popularity by lacking\nnational significance, and won a war by imparting recklessness to\ntyphus camps.  I was certain then, and still dare bet to-day that\nthose ruined castle walls re-echoed for the first time that evening\nto the clamor of '--a hot time in the old town to-night!\"\n\nSeeing the point in a flash, we three roared the song together, and\nthen again, and then once more for interest, the Armenians eying\nus spell-bound, at a loss to explain the madness.  Then there began\nto be unexplained movements behind the blanket hanging;  and a minute\nlater a woman broke through--an unmistakable Armenian, still good-looking\nbut a little past the prime of life, and very obviously mentally\ndistressed.  She scarcely took notice of us, but poured forth a long\nflow of rhetoric interspersed with sobs for breath.  I could see\nFred chuckling as he listened.  All the facial warnings that a dozen\nmen could make at the woman from behind Fred's back could not check\nher from telling all she knew.\n\nNor were Will and I, who knew no Armenian, kept in doubt very long\nas to the nature of her trouble.  We heard another woman's voice,\nbehind two or three sets of curtains by the sound of it, that came\nrapidly nearer;  and there were sounds of scuffling.  Then we\nheard words.\n\n\"Please play that tune again, whoever you are!  Do you hear me?\nDo you understand?\"\n\n\"Boston!\" announced Will, diagnosing accents.\n\n\"You bet your life I understand!\" Fred shouted, and clanged through\nhalf a dozen bars again.\n\nThat seemed satisfactory to the owner of the voice.  The scuffling\nwas renewed, and in a moment she had burst through the crude curtains\nwith two women clinging to her, and stood there with her brown hair\nfalling on her shoulders and her dress all disarrayed but looking\nsimply serene in contrast to the women who tried to restrain her.\nThey tried once or twice to thrust her back through the curtain,\nalthough clearly determined to do her no injury;  but she held her\nground easily.  At a rough guess it was tennis and boating that had\ndone more for her muscles than ever strenuous housework did for the\nArmenians.\n\n\"Who are you?\" she asked, and Will laughed with delight.\n\n\"I reckon you'll be Miss Vanderman?' suggested Fred in outrageous\nYankee accent.  She stared hard at him.\n\n\"I am Miss Vanderman.  Who are you, please.\n\nI sat down on the great stone they had rolled over the trap, for\neven in that flickering, smoky light I could see that this young\nwoman was incarnate loveliness as well as health and strength.  Will\nwas our only ladies' man (for Fred is no more than random troubadour,\ndecamping before any love-affair gets serious).  The thought conjured\nvisions of Maga, and what she might do.  For about ten seconds my\nhead swam, and I could hardly keep my feet.\n\nWill left the opening bars of the overture to Fred, with rather the\nair of a man who lets a trout have line.  And Fred blundered\nin contentedly.\n\n\"I'll allow my name is Oakes--Fred Oakes,\" he said.\n\n\"Please explain!\"  She looked from one to the other of us.\n\n\"We three are American towerists, going the grand trip.\" (Remember,\na score of Armenians were listening.  Fred's intention was at least\nas much to continue their contentment as to extract humor from the\nsituation.)  \"You being reported missing we allowed to pick you up\nand run you in to Tarsus.  Air you agreeable?\"\n\nThe women were still clinging to her as if their whole future depended\non keeping her prisoner, yet without hurt.  She looked down at them\npathetically, and then at the men, who were showing no disposition\nto order her release.\n\n\"I don't understand in the least yet.  I find you bewildering.  Can\nyou contrive to let us talk for a few minutes alone?\"\n\n\"You bet your young life I can!\"\n\nFred stepped to the wall beside us, but we none of us drew pistol\nyet.  We had no right to presume we were not among friends.\n\n\"Thirty minutes interlude!\" he announced.  \"The man who stands in\nthis room one minute from now, or who comes back to the room without\nmy leave, is not my friend, and shall learn what that means!\"\n\nHe repeated the soft insinuation in Armenian, and then in Turkish\nbecause he knows that language best.  There is not an Armenian who\nhas not been compelled to learn Turkish for all official purposes,\nand unconsciously they gave obedience to the hated conquerors' tongue,\nrepressing the desire to argue that wells perennially in Armenian\nbreasts.  They had not been long enough enjoying stolen liberty to\novercome yet the full effects of Turkish rule.\n\n\"And oblige me by leaving that lady alone with us!\" Fred continued.\n\"Let those dames fall away!\"\n\nSomebody said something to the women.  Another Armenian remarked\nmore or less casually that we should be unable to escape from the\nroom in any case.  The others rolled the great stone from the trap\nand shoved the smaller stones aside, and then they all filed down\nthe stone stairs, leaving us alone--although by the trembling blankets\nit was easy to tell that the women had not gone far.  The last man\nwho went below handed the spluttering torch to Miss Vanderman, as\nif she might need it to defend herself, and she stood there shaking\nit to try and make it smoke less until the planks were back in place.\nShe was totally unconscious of it, but with the torch-light gleaming\non her hair and reflected in her blue eyes she looked like the spirit\nof old romance come forth to start a holy war.\n\n\"Now please explain!\" she begged, when I had pushed the last stone\nin place.  \"First, what kind of Americans can you possibly be?  Do\nyou all use such extraordinary accents, and such expressions?\"\n\n\"Don't I talk American to beat the band?\" objected Fred.  \"Sit down\non this rock a while, and I'll convince you.\"\n\nShe sat on the rock, and we gathered round her.  She was not more\nthan twenty-two or three, but as perfectly assured and fearless as\nonly a well-bred woman can be in the presence of unshaven men she\ndoes not know.  Fred would have continued the tomfoolery, but Will\noared in.\n\n\"I'm Will Yerkes, Miss Vanderman.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"I know Nurse Vanderman at the mission.\"\n\n\"Yes, she spoke of you.\"\n\n\"Fred Oakes here is--\"\n\n\"Is English as they make them, yes, I know!  Why the amazing efforts to--\"\n\n\"I stand abashed, like the leopard with the spots unchangeable!\"\nsaid Fred, and grinned most unashamedly.\n\n\"They're both English.\"\n\n\"Yes, I see, but why--\"\n\n\"It's only as good Americans that we three could hope to enter here\nalive.  They're death on all other sorts of non-Armenians now they've\ntaken to the woods.  We supposed you were here, and of course we\nhad to come and get you.\"\n\nShe nodded.  \"Of course.  But how did you know?\"\n\n\"That's a long story.  Tell us first why you're here, and why you're\na prisoner.\"\n\n\"I was going to the mission at Marash--to stay a year there and help,\nbefore returning to the States.  They warned me in Tarsus that the\ntrip might be dangerous, but I know how short-handed they are at\nMarash, and I wouldn't listen.  Besides, they picked the best men\nthey could find to bring me on the way, and I started.  I had a Turkish\npermit to travel--a teskere they call it--see, I have it here.  It\nwas perfectly ridiculous to think of my not going.\"\n\n\"Perfectly!\" Fred agreed.  \"Any young woman in your place would have\ncome away!\"\n\nShe laughed, and colored a trifle.  \"Women and men are equals in\nthe States, Mr. Oakes.\"\n\n\"And the Turk ought to know that!  I get you, Miss Vanderman!  I\nsee the point exactly!\"\n\n\"At any rate, I started.  And we slept at night in the houses of\nArmenians whom my guides knew, so that the journey wasn't bad at\nall.  Everything was going splendidly until we reached a sort of\ncrossroads--if you can call those goat-tracks roads without stretching\ntruth too far--and there three men came galloping toward us on blown\nhorses from the direction of Marash.  We could hardly get them to\nstop and tell us what the trouble was, they were in such a hurry,\nbut I set my horse across the path and we held them up.\"\n\n\"As any young lady would have done!\" Fred murmured.\n\n\"Never mind. I did it!  They told us, when they could get their breath\nand quit looking behind them like men afraid of ghosts, that the\nTurks in Marash--which by all accounts is a very fanatical place--had\nstarted to murder Armenians.  They yelled at me to turn and run.\n\n\"'Run where?' I asked them.  'The Turks won't murder me!'\n\n\"That seemed to make them think, and they and my six men all talked\ntogether in Armenian much too fast for me to understand a word of\nit.  Then they pointed to some smoke on the sky-line that they said\nwas from burning Armenian homes in Marash.\n\n\"s'Why didn't you take refuge in the mission?' I asked them.  And\nthey answered that it was because the mission grounds were already\nfull of refugees.\n\n\"Well, if that were true--and mind you, I didn't believe it--it was\na good reason why I should hurry there and help.  If the mission\nstaff was overworked before that they would be simply overwhelmed\nnow.  So I told them to turn round and come to Marash with me and\nmy six men.\"\n\n\"And what did they say?\" we demanded together.\n\n\"They laughed.  They said nothing at all to me.  Perhaps they thought\nI was mad.  They talked together for five minutes, and then without\nconsulting me they seized my bridle and galloped up a goat-path that\nled after a most interminable ride to this place.\"\n\n\"Where they hold you to ransom?\"\n\n\"Not at all.  They've been very kind to me.  I think that at the\nbottom of their thoughts there may be some idea of exchanging me\nfor some of their own women whom the Turks have made away with.\nBut a stronger motive than that is the determination to keep me safe\nand be able to produce me afterward in proof of their bona fides.\nThey've got me here as witness, for another thing.  And then, I've\nstarted a sort of hospital in this old keep.  There are literally\nhundreds of men and women hiding in these hills, and the women are\nbeginning to come to me for advice, and to talk with me.  I'm pretty\nnearly as useful here as I would be at Marash.\"\n\n\"And you're--let's see--nineteen-twenty--one--two--not more than\ntwenty-two,\" suggested Fred.\n\n\"Is intelligence governed by age and sex in England.\" she retorted,\nand Fred smiled in confession of a hit.\n\n\"Go on,\" said Will.  \"Tell us.\"\n\n\"There's nothing more to tell.  When I started to run toward\nthe--ah--music, the women tried to prevent me.  They knew Americans\nhad come, and they feared you might take me away.\"\n\n\"They were guessing good!\" grinned Will.\n\nShe shook her head, and the loosened coils of hair fell lower.  One\ncould hardly have blamed a man who had desired her in that lawless\nland and sought to carry her off.  The Armenian men must have been\ntemptation proof, or else there had been safety in numbers.\n\n\"I shall stay here.  How could I leave them?  The women need me.\nThere are babies--daily--almost hourly--here in these lean hills,\nand no organized help of any kind until I came.\"\n\n\"How long have you been here?\" I asked.\n\n\"Nearly two days.  Wait till I've been here a week and you'll see.\"\n\n\"We can't wait to see!\" Will answered.  \"We've a friend of our own\nin a tight place.  The best we can do is to rescue you--\"\n\n\"I don't need to be rescued!\"\n\n\"--to rescue you--take you back to Tarsus, where you'll be safe until\nthe trouble's over--and then hurry to the help of our own man.\"\n\n\"Who is your own man?  Tell me about him.\"\n\n\"He's a prince.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"No, really an earl--Earl of Montdidier.  White.  White all through\nto the wish-bone.  Whitest man I ever camped with.  He's the goods.\"\n\n\"If you'd said less I'd have skinned you for an ingrate!\" Fred\nannounced.       \"Monty is a man men love.\"\n\nMiss Vanderman nodded. \"Where is he?\"\n\n\"On the way to a place called Zeitoon,\" answered Will.\n\n\"He's a hostage, held by Armenians in the hope of putting pressure\non the Turks.  Kagig--the Armenians, that's to say--let us go to\nrescue you, knowing that he was sufficiently important for\ntheir purpose.\"\n\n\"And you left your friend to help me?\"\n\n\"Of course.  What do you suppose?\"\n\n\"And if I were to go with you to Tarsus, what then?\"\n\n\"He says we're to ride herd on the consulate and argue.\"\n\n\"Will you?\"\n\n\"Sure we'll argue.  We'll raise particular young hell.  Then back\nwe go to Zeitoon to join him!\"\n\n\"Would you have gone to Tarsus except on my account?\"\n\nWill hesitated.\n\n\"No.  I see.  Of course you wouldn't.  Well.  What do you take me\nfor?  You did not know me then.  You do now.  Do you think I'd consent\nto your leaving your fine friend in pawn while you dance attendance\non me?  Thank you kindly for your offer, but go back to him!  If\nyou don't I'll never speak to one of you again!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter Ten\n\"When I fire this Pistol--\"\n\n\nTHESE LITTLE ONES\n\nIf Life were what the liars say\nAnd failure called the tune\nMayhap the road to ruin then\nWere cluttered deep wi' broken men;\nWe'd all be seekers blindly led\nTo weave wi' worms among the dead,\nIf Life were what the liars say\nAnd failure called the tune.\n\nBut Life is Father of us all\n(Dear Father, if we knew!)\nAnd underneath eternal arms\nUphold. We'll mock the false alarms,\nAnd trample on the neck of pain,\nAnd laugh the dead alive again,\nFor Life is Father to us all,\nAnd thanks are overdue!\n\nIf Truth were what the learned say\nAnd envy called the tune\nMayhap 'twere trite what treason saith\nThat man is dust and ends in death;\nWe'd slay with proof of printed law\nWhatever was new that seers saw,\nIf Truth were what the learned say\nAnd envy called the tune.\n\nBut Truth is Brother of us all\n(Oh, Brother, if we knew!)\nUnspattered by the muddied lies\nThat pass for wisdom of the wise--\nCompassionate, alert, unbought,\nOf purity and presence wrought,--\nBig Brother that includes us all\nNor knows the name of Few!\n\nIf Love were what the harlots say\nAnd hunger called the tune\nMayhap we'd need conserve the joys\nWeighed grudgingly to girls and boys,\nAnd eat the angels trapped and sold\nBy shriven priests for stolen gold,\nIf Love were what the harlots say\nAnd hunger called the tune.\n\nBut Love is Mother of us all\n(Dear Mother, if we knew!)--\nSo wise that not a sparrow falls,\nNor friendless in the prison calls\nUncomforted or uncaressed.\nThere's magic milk at Mercy's breast,\nAnd little ones shall lead us all\nWhen Trite Love calls the tune!\n\n\nNaturally, being what we were, with our friend Monty held in durance\nby a chief of outlaws, we were perfectly ready to kidnap Miss Vanderman\nand ride off with her in case she should be inclined to delay\nproceedings.  It was also natural that we had not spoken of that\ncontingency, nor even considered it.\n\n\"We never dreamed of your refusing to come with us,\" said Will.\n\n\"We still don't dream of it!\" Fred asserted, and she turned her head\nvery swiftly to look at him with level brows.  Next she met my eyes.\nIf there was in her consciousness the slightest trace of doubt, or\nfear, or admission that her sex might be less responsible than ours,\nshe did not show it.  Rather in the blue eyes and the athletic poise\nof chin, and neck, and shoulders there was a dignity beyond ours.\n\nWill laughed.\n\n\"Don't let's be ridiculous,\" she said.  \"I shall do as I see fit.\"\n\nFred's neat beard has a trick of losing something of its trim when\nhe proposes to assert himself, and I recognized the symptoms.  But\nat the moment of that impasse the Armenians below us had decided\nthat self-assertion was their cue, and there came great noises as\nthey thundered with a short pole on the trap and made the stones\njump that held it down.\n\nAt that signal several women emerged from behind the hanging\nblankets--young and old women in various states of disarray--and stood\nin attitudes suggestive of aggression.  One did not get the idea that\nArmenians, men or women, were sheeplike pacifists.  They watched\nMiss Vanderman with the evident purpose of attacking us the moment\nshe appealed to them.\n\n\"If you don't roll the stones away I think there'll be trouble,\"\nshe said, and came and stood between Will and me.  Fred got behind\nme, and began to whisper.  I heard something or other about the trap,\nand supposed he was asking me to open it, although I failed to see\nwhy the request should be kept secret;  but the women forestalled\nme, and in a moment they had the stones shoved aside and the men\nwere emerging one by one through the opening.\n\nThen at last I got Fred's meaning.  There was a second of indecision\nduring which the Armenians consulted their women-folk, in two minds\nbetween snatching Miss Vanderman out of our reach or discovering\nfirst what our purpose might be.  I took advantage of it to slip\ndown the stone stairs behind them.\n\nThe opening in the castle wall was easy to find, for the star-lit\nsky looked luminous through the hole.  Once outside, however, the\ngloom of ancient trees and the castle's shadow seemed blacker than\nthe dungeon had been.  I groped about, and stumbled over loose stones\nfallen from the castle wall, until at last one of our own Zeitoonli\ndiscovered me and, thinking I might be a trouble-maker, tripped me\nup.  Cursing fervently from underneath his iron-hard carcass I made\nhim recognize me at last.  Then he offered me tobacco, unquestionably\nstolen from our pack, and sat down beside me on a rock while I recovered\nbreath.\n\nIt took longer to do that than he expected, for he had enjoyed the\nadvantage of surprise while hampered by no compunctions on the ground\nof moderation.  When the agony of windlessness was gone and I could\nquestion him he assured me that the horses were well enough, but\nthat he and his two companions were hungry.  Furthermore, he added,\nthe animals were very closely watched--so much so that the other\ntwo, Sombat and Noorian, were standing guard to watch the watchers.\n\n\"But I am sure they are fools,\" he added.\n\nThis man Arabaiji had been an excellent servant, but decidedly\nsupercilious toward the others from the time when he first came to\nus in the khan at Tarsus.  Regarding himself as intelligent, which\nhe was, he usually refused to concede that quality, or anything\nresembling it, to his companions.\n\n\"That is why I was looking for you when you hit me in the dark with\nthat club of a fist of yours,\" I answered.  \"I wanted to speak with\nyou alone because I know you are not a fool.\"\n\nHe felt so flattered that he promptly let his pipe go out.\n\n\"While Sombat and Noorian are keeping an eye on the horses, I want\nyou to watch for trouble up above here,\" I said.  \"In case the people\nof this place should seek to make us prisoner, then I want you to\ngallop, if you can get your horse, and run otherwise, to the nearest--\"\n\nHe checked me with a gesture and one word.\n\n\"Kagig!\"\n\n\"What about him?\" I demanded.\n\n\"If I were to bring Turks here, Kagig would never rest until my fingers\nwere pulled off one by one!\"\n\n\"If you were to bring Turks here, or appeal to Turks,\" said I, \"Kagig\nwould never get you.\"\n\n\"How not?\"\n\n\"Unless he should find your dead carcass after my friends and I had\nfinished with it!\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\nHe lighted his pipe again by way of reestablishing himself in his\nown esteem, and it glowed and crackled wetly in the dark beside me\nin response to the workings of his intelligence.\n\n\"In case of trouble up here, and our being held prisoner, go and\nfind other Armenians, and order them in Kagig's name to come and\nrescue us.\"\n\n\"Those who obey Kagig are with Kagig,\" he answered.\n\n\"Surely not all?\"\n\n\"All that Kagig could gather to him after eleven years!\"\n\n\"In that case go to Kagig, and tell him.\"\n\n\"Kagig would not come.  He holds Zeitoon.\"\n\n\"Are you a fool?\"\n\n\"Not I!  The other two are fools.\"\n\n\"Then do you understand that in case these people should make\nus prisoner--\"\n\nHe nodded.  \"They might.  They might propose to sell you to the\nTurks, perhaps against their own stolen women-folk.\"\n\n\"Then don't you see that if you were gone, and I told them you had\ngone to bring Kagig, they would let us go rather than face\nKagig's wrath?\"\n\n\"But Kagig would not come.\"\n\n\"I know that.  But how should they know it?\"\n\nI knew that he nodded again by the motion of the glowing tobacco\nin his pipe.  It glowed suddenly bright, as a new idea dawned on\nhim.  He was an honest fellow, and did not conceal the thought.\n\n\"Kagig would not send me back to you,\" he said.  \"He is short of\nmen at Zeitoon.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" said I.  \"In case of trouble up above here, but not\notherwise, will you do that?\"\n\n\"Gladly.  But give it me in writing, lest Kagig have me beaten for\nrunning from you without leave.\"\n\nThat was my turn to jump at a proposal.  I tore a sheet from my\nmemorandum book, and scribbled in the dark, knowing he could not\nread what I had written.\n\n\"This writing says that you did not run away until you had made quite\nsure we were in difficulties.  So, if you should run too soon, and\nwe should not be in difficulties after all, Kagig would learn that\nsooner or later.  What would Kagig do in that case?\"\n\n\"He would throw me over the bridge at Zeitoon--if he could catch\nme!  Nay!  I play no tricks.\"\n\n\"Good.  Then go and hide.  Hide within call.  Within an hour, or\nat most two hours we shall know how the land lies.  If all should\nbe well I will change that writing for another one, and send you\nto Kagig in any case.  No more words now--go and hide!\"\n\nHe put his pipe out with his thumb, and took two strides into a shadow,\nand was gone.  Then I went back through the gap in the dungeon wall,\nand stumbled to the stairs.  Apparently not missing me yet, they\nhad covered up the trap, and I had to hammer on it for admission.\nThey were not pleased when my head appeared through the hole, and\nthey realized that I had probably held communication with our men.\nI suppose Fred saw by my face that I had accomplished what I went\nfor, because he let out a laugh like a fox's bark that did nothing\ntoward lessening the tension.\n\nOn the other hand it was quite clear that during my absence Miss\nVanderman had not been idle.  Excepting the two men who had admitted\nme, every one was seated--she on the floor among the women, with\nher back to the wall, and the rest in a semicircle facing them.\nTwo of the women had their arms about her, affectionately, but not\nwithout a hint of who controlled the situation.\n\n\"What have you been doing?\" Fred demanded, and he laughed at Gloria\nVanderman with an air of triumph.\n\n\"Making preparations,\" I said, \"to take Miss Vanderman to Tarsus.\"\n\nI wish I could set down here a chart of the mixed emotions then\nexpressed on that young lady's face.  She did not look at Will,\nknowing perhaps that she already had him captive of her bow and spear.\nNeither did Will look at us, but sat tracing figures with a forefinger\nin the dust between his knees, wondering perhaps how to excuse or\nexplain, and getting no comfort.\n\nIf my guess was correct, Gloria Vanderman was about equally distracted\nbetween the alternative ignominy of submitting her free will to Armenians\nor else to us.  Compassion for the women in their predicament weighed\none way--knowledge that our friend Monty was in durance vile contingent\non her actions pulled heavily another Fred was frankly enjoying himself,\nwhich influenced her strongly toward the Armenian side, she being\nyoung and, doubtless the idol of a hundred heart-sick Americans,\ncontemptuous of forty-year-old bachelors.\n\n\"Of course we shall not let you go!\" one of the Armenians assured\nher in quite good English, and I began fumbling at the pistol in\nmy inner pocket, for if Arabaiji was to run to Zeitoon, then the\nsooner the better.  But it needed only that imputation of helplessness\nto tip the beam of Miss Gloria's judgment.\n\n\"You can attend to the sick ones.  You can play music for us all.\nDoubtless these other two have qualifications.\"\n\nI was too busy admiring Gloria to know what effect that announcement\nhad on Fred and Will.  She shook herself free from the women, and\nstood up, splendid in the flickering yellow light.  There was a sort\nof swift move by every one to be ready against contingencies, and\nI judged it the right moment to spring my own surprise.\n\n\"When I fire this pistol,\" I said, producing it, \"a man will start\nat once for Zeitoon to warn Kagig.  He has a note in his pocket written\nto Kagig.  Judge for yourselves how long it will take Kagig and his\nmen to reach this place!\"\n\nThe nearest man made a very well-judged spring at me and pinned my\nelbows from behind.  Another man knocked the pistol from my hand.\nThe women seized Gloria again.  But Fred was too quick--drew his\nown pistol, and fired at the roof.\n\n\"Twice, Fred!\" I shouted, and he fired again.\n\n\"There!\" said I.  \"Do what you like.  The messenger has gone!\"\n\nAnd then Gloria shook herself free a last time, and took command.\n\n\"Is that true?\" she demanded.\n\nI nodded.  \"The best of our three men was to start on his way the\nminute he heard the second shot.\"\n\nThen I was sure she was Boadicea reincarnate, whether the old-time\nBritish queen did or did not have blue eyes and brown hair.\n\n\"I will not have brave men brought back here on my account!  Kagig\nmust be a patriot!  He needs all his men!  I don't blame him for\nmaking a hostage of Lord Montdidier!  I would do the same myself!\"\n\nWill had evidently given her a pretty complete synopsis of our\nadventure while I was outside talking with Arabaiji.  It is always\na mystery to the British that Americans should hold themselves a\nrace apart and rally to each other as if the rest of the Anglo-Saxon\nrace were foreigners, but those two had obeyed the racial rule.\nThey understood each other--swiftly--a bar and a half ahead of\nthe tune.\n\n\"This old castle is no good!\" she went on, not raising her voice\nvery high, but making it ring with the wholesomeness of youth, and\nyouth's intolerance of limits.  \"The Turks could come to this place\nand burn it within a day if they chose!\"\n\n\"The Turks won't trouble.  They'll send their friends the Kurds instead,\"\nFred assured her.\n\n\"Ah-h-h-gh!\" growled the Armenians, but she waved them back to silence.\n\n\"How much food have you?  Almost none!  How much ammunition?\"\n\n\"Ah-h-h-h!\" they chorused in a very different tone of voice.\n\n\"D'you mean you've got cartridges here?\" Fred demanded.\n\n\"Fifty cases of cartridges for government Mauser rifles!\" bragged\nthe man who was nearest to Will.\n\n\"Gee!  Kagig 'ud give his eyes for them!\"  (Will devoted his eyes\nto the more poetic purpose of exchanging flashed encouragement\nwith Gloria.)\n\n\"Men, women and children--how many of you are there?\"\n\n\"Who knows?  Who has counted?  They keep coming.\"\n\n\"No, they don't.  You've set a guard to keep any more away for fear\nthe food won't last--I know you have!  Well--what does it matter\nhow many you are?  I say let us all go to Zeitoon and help Kagig!\"\n\n\"Oh, bravo!\" shouted Fred, but it was Will's praise that proved\nacceptable and made her smile.\n\n\"Second the motion!\"\n\nI added a word or two by way of make-weight, that did more as a matter\nof fact than her young ardor to convince those very skeptical men\nand women.  No doubt she broke up their determination to sit still,\nbut it was my words that set them on a course.\n\n\"Kagig will be angry when he comes.  He's a ruthless man,\" said I,\nand the Armenians, men as well as women, sought one another's eyes\nand nodded.\n\n\"Kagig must be more of a ruthless bird than we guessed!\" Will whispered.\n\nCounting women, there was less than a score of refugees in the room,\nand if we had only had them to convince, our work was pretty nearly\ndone.  There was the guard among the trees down-hill that we knew\nabout still to be converted, or perhaps coerced.  But just at the\nmoment when we felt we held the winning hand, there came a ladder\nthrust down through the hole in the corner of the roof, and a man\nwhom they all greeted as Ephraim began to climb down backward.  He\nwas so loaded with every imaginable kind of weapon that he made more\nnoise than a tinker's cart.\n\nNor was Ephraim the only new arrival.  Man after man came down backward\nafter him, each man cursed richly for treading on his predecessor's\nfingers--a seeming endless chain of men that did not cease when the\nroom was already uncomfortably overcrowded.  Some of these men wore\nclothes that suggested Russia, but the majority were in rags.  The\nladder swayed and creaked under them, and finally, at a word from\nEphraim, the last-comers sat on the upper rungs, bending the frail\nthing with their weight into a complaining loop.\n\nSeveral of the newcomers had torches, and their acrid smoke turned\nthe twice-breathed air of the place into evil-tasting fog.\n\nThree men put their faces close to Ephraim's and proceeded to enlighten\nhim as to what had passed.  He seemed to be recognized as some sort\nof chieftain, and carried himself with a commanding air, but so many\nmen talked at once, and all in Armenian, that we could not pick out\nmore than a word or two here and there.  Even Fred, with his gift\nof tongues, could hardly make head or tail of it.\n\nWe three pressed through the swarm and took our stand beside Gloria,\nnot hesitating to thrust the other women aside.  They dragged at their\nmen-folk to call attention to us, but the argument was too hot to\nbe missed, and the women clawed and screamed in vain.\n\n\"I believe we could get out!\" I shouted in Will's ear.  But he shook\nhis head.  At least six men were standing on the trap, and we could\nnot have driven them off it because there was no other space on the\nfloor that they could occupy.  So I turned to Fred.\n\n\"Couldn't we shake those ruffians off the ladder, and climb up it\nand escape?\" I shouted.  But Fred shook his head, and went on listening,\ntrying to follow the course of the dispute.\n\nAt last somebody with louder lungs than any other man made Ephraim\nunderstand that it was I who sent the messenger to Zeitoon.  Instantly\nthat solved the problem to his mind.  I should be hanged, and that\nwould be all about it.  He gesticulated.  The men swarmed down off\nthe ladder to the already overcrowded floor, and mistaking Will for\nme several men started to thrust him forward.  A face appeared through\nthe hole in the roof and its owner was sent running for a rope.\nI had not recovered my pistol, and my rifle was slung at my back\nwhere I could not possibly get at it for the crowd.  But Fred had\na Colt repeater handy in his hip-pocket and he promptly screwed the\nmuzzle of it into Ephraim's ear.  What he said to him I don't know,\nbut Ephraim's convictions underwent a change of base and he began\nto yell for silence.  The men who had seized Will let go of him just\nas the rope with a disgusting noose in the end was lowered through\nthe roof.  And then Ossa was imposed on Pelion.\n\nA new face appeared at the hole.  Not that we could see the face.\nWe could only see the form of a man who shook the bloody stump of\na forearm at us, and shrieked unintelligible things.  After thirty\nseconds even the men in the far corner were aware of him, and then\nthere was stony silence while he had his say.  He repeated his message\na dozen times, as if he had it by heart exactly, spitting foam out\nof his mouth and never ceasing to shake the butchered stump of an\narm.  At about the dozenth time he fainted and fell headlong down\nthe ladder bringing up on the shoulders of the men below.\n\n\"What does he say?\" I bellowed in Fred's car.  But Fred was forcing\nhis way closer to Gloria, to tell her.\n\n\"He says the Kurds are coming!  He says two regiments of Kurdish\ncavalry have been turned loose by the Turks with orders to 'rescue'\nArmenians.  They are on their way, riding by night for a wonder.\nThey cut both his hands off, but he got away by shamming dead.\n\nHe says they are cutting off the feet of people and bidding them\nwalk to Tarsus.  They are taking the women and girls for sale.  Old\nwomen and very little children they are making what they call sport\nwith.  Have you heard of Kurds?  Their ideas of sport are worse than\nthe Red-man's ever were.\"\n\nEvery tongue in the room broke loose.  In another second every man\nwas still.  They looked toward Ephraim.  He who could order a hanging\nso glibly should shoulder the new responsibility.\n\nBut Ephraim was not ready with a plan, and could not speak English.\nWild-eyed, he seized the lapel of my coat in trembling fingers, and\nwith a throat grown suddenly parched, crackled a question at me in\nArmenian.  I could have understood Volopuk easier.\n\n\"What does he say, Fred?\"\n\n\"He wants to know how soon Kagig can be here.\"\n\n\"Kagig!\" Ephraim echoed, clutching at my collar.  \"Yes, yes, yes!\nKagig!  Come--how soon?\"\n\n\"We shall be all right,\" said another man in English over on the\nfar side of the room.  His hoarse voice sounded like a bellow in\nthe silence.  \"Kagig will come presently.  Kagig will butcher the\nKurds.  Kagig will certainly save us.\"\n\n\"Kagig!\" Ephraim insisted.  \"Come----how soon?\"\n\nBut I knew Kagig would not come, that night or at any time, and Ephraim\nshook me in frenzied impatience for an answer.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Eleven\n\"That man's dose is death, and he dies unshriven!\"\n\n\n\"MALE AND FEMALE CREATED HE THEM\"\n\nThe ancient orders pass.  The fetters fall.\nAll-potent inspiration stirs dead peoples to new birth.\nAnd over bloodied fields a new, clear call\nRings kindlier on deadened ears of earth.\nMan--male--usurping--unwise overlord,\nIndoctrinated, flattered, by himself betrayed\nAnd all-betraying since with idiot word\nHe bade his woman bear and be afraid,\nAwakes to see delusion of the past\nUnmourned along with all injustice die,\nHimself by woman wisdom blessed at last\nAnd her unchallenged right the reason why.\n\n\nNow for a moment I became the unwilling vortex of that mob of anxious\nmen and women--I who by, my own confession knew Kagig, I who had\nsent Kagig a message, I who five minutes ago was on the verge of\nbeing hanged in the greasy noose that still swung above the ladder\nthrough the hole in the roof--I who therefore ought to be thoroughly\nplastic-minded and obedient to demands.\n\nThe place had become as evil smelling as the Black Hole of Calcutta.\nEverybody was sweating, and they shoved and milled murderously in\nthe effort to get near me and learn, each with his own ears from\nmy lips, just when Kagig might be expected.  Ephraim, their presumptive\nleader, got shuffled to the outside of the pack--the only silent\nman between the four walls, watchful for new opportunity.\n\nWith my clothing nearly torn off and cars in agony from bellowed\nquestions, the only remedy I could think of was to yell to Fred to\nstart up a tune on his concertina;  I had seen him change a crowd's\ntemper many a time in just that way.  But even supposing my advice\nhad been good, he could not get his arms free, and it was Gloria\nVanderman who saved that day.\n\nWhoever has tried to write down the quality that makes the college\ngirl, United States or English, what she is has failed, just as whoever\nhas tried to muzzle or discredit her has failed.  She is something\nnew that has happened to the world, not because of men and women\nand the priests and pundits, but in spite of them.  Part of the reason\ncan be given by him who knows history enough, and commands almost\nunlimited leisure and page;  but that would only be the uninteresting\npart that we could easily dispense with.  The college girl has happened\nto the world, as light did in Genesis 1:3.\n\nGloria Vanderman, with her back against the wall, struggled and\ncontrived to get her foot on Will's bent knee.  Another struggle\nsent her breast-high above the sea of sweating faces.  There was\nfitful light enough to see her by, because the man who held a pine\ntorch was privileged.  If there had not been hot sparks scattering\nfrom the thing doubtless they would have closed in on him and crushed\nit down, and out, but he had elbow-room, and accordingly Gloria's\nface glowed golden in its frame of disordered chestnut hair.  One\nheard her voice because it was clear, and sweet with reasonableness,\nso that it vibrated in an unobstructed orbit.\n\n\"Surely you are not cowards?\" she began, and they grew silent, because\nthat idea called for consideration.\n\n\"Kagig is a patriot.  Kagig is fighting for all Armenia.  Surely\nyou are not the men to let brave Kagig be tempted away from his post\nof danger at Zeitoon?  If I know you men and women you will hasten\nto meet Kagig, taking your food, and weapons, and children with you.\nYou will hurry--hurry--hurry to meet him--to meet him as near Zeitoon\nas possible, so as to turn him back to his post of duty!\"\n\nThen Ephraim saw his chance.  Some whisperer translated to him and\nhe owned a voice that was worth gold for political purposes.\n\nHe took up the tale in Armenian, working himself up into a splendid\nfervor, and so amplifying the argument that he could almost fairly\nclaim it as his own before he was half-done.  She had introduced\nthe light, but he exploited it, and he knew his nation--knew the\ntricks of speech most likely to spur them into action.\n\nWithin five minutes they were shoving the stones off the trap at\nimminent risk of anybody's legs, and the ladder bent groaning under\nthe weight of twice as many as it ought to bear, as half of them\nessayed the short cut over the roof.  A blast of sweet air through\nthe opened trap ejected most of the smoky ten-times-breathed stuff\nout with the climbers;  and as the room emptied and we wiped the\ngrimy sweat from our faces I heard Will talking to Gloria Vanderman\nin a new tongue--new, that is to say, to the old world.\n\n\"Good goods!  Stampeded 'em!  They'll vote for you for any office--your\npick!  If that guy Ephraim plans buttering the slide we'll\nset him on it--watch!\"\n\n\"You bet,\" she answered sentimentally.  \"I wasn't cheer leader for\nnothing.  Besides, I delivered the valedictory--say, what are we\nwaiting here for?\"\n\n\"Come on, then!\" I urged her.  \"We'll leave our mule-load behind\nin case they've eaten your horse.  Come with us to the stables and--\"\n\nBut she interrupted me.\n\n\"You men go down and get the horses.  Do what you can with the crowd.\nI'll get the women into something like order if that's possible,\nand we'll all meet wherever there's open ground and moonlight at\nthe foot of the hill.\"\n\n\"I'll come with you,\" Will proposed.  \"You'll need--\"\n\n\"No you won't!  The women are easy.  They've been taught to obey\norders!  It'll take all the wit you three men own between you to\nget the men in line!  Let's get busy!\"\n\nThe men had treated the hanging blankets with the respect the ancient\nJews accorded to the veil of the Holy of Holies.  (We learned afterward\nthat there was an Armenian man of the party who had followed a circus\none summer all across the States, and had brought that sensible\nprecaution home with him as rule number one for successful management\nof mixed assemblies.)  Gloria Vanderman made a run for the curtain\nand dived behind it.  We heard the women welcome her.\n\n\"Let's go!\" said Will.\n\nWill had ever been our ladies' man in all our wanderings, because\nwomen could never resist his unaffected comradeship.  Even among\nAmericans he was rare in his gift of according to women equality\nnot only of liberty, but of understanding and good sense, and it\nwent like wine to the heads of some we had met, so that Will was\nseldom without a sex-problem on his hands and ours.  But Will was\ntoo good a comrade to be surrendered to any woman lightly.\n\n\"Damn that chicken!\" murmured Fred by way of praying fervently, pausing\nin the breach in the wall to rub his shin.  \"Feel that bruise, will\nyou!  No young woman ever brought me luck yet!\"\n\n\"What are you waiting for?\" complained a voice from outer darkness.\n\"Come on, you rummies!\"\n\nFred sat down on the protruding stone that had injured his shin,\nand detained me with his arm across the opening.\n\n\"Mark my words!  In order that that young woman may be educated to\nconsider Will Yerkes a paragon of unimaginable virtues, we--you and\nI--are going to have to do what he calls 'hustle.'  We're going to\nsee speed, and we're going to sweat, trying to catch up.  There isn't\na scatterbrained adventure conceivable that we're not going to be\nforced into, nor an imaginable peril that we're not going to have\nto pull him out of.  We're going to be cursed for our trouble, and\nridiculed to make amusement for her majesty.  And at the end of it\nall we're going to be patronized for a couple of ignorant damned\nfools who don't know better than be bachelors.  What's worse, we're\ngoing to submit tamely.  What is infinitely worse, we're going to\nlike it!  There are times when I doubt the sanity of my whole sex!\"\n\n\"Have you guys taken root?\" demanded the familiar voice and we heard\nWill's returning footsteps.\n\n\"No, America.  But I have to sit down when my shin hurts and I'm\nseized with the gift of prophecy.\"\n\n\"Huh!  We'll find Miss Vanderman tired of waiting for us with the\nwomen.  Since when has a crack on the shin made a baby of you?  You\nused to be tough enough!\"\n\n\"D'you get the idea?\" chuckled Fred.  \"We're coming, Will, we're\ncoming.\"\n\nPerfectly unconsciously Will took the lead, and most outrageously\nhe drove us.  Not that his driving was not shrewd, for his usually\npractical and quick mind seemed to take on added brilliancy.  And\nsince we first joined partnership--he and Monty and Fred and I--we\nhad always been contented to follow the lead of whichever held it\nat the moment.  But there was new efficiency, and impatience of a\nbrand-new kind that would not rest until every man and animal had\nbeen rummaged in darkness out of that old ruin, and men, horses,\ncows, goats, bags of grain, and fifty cases of cartridges were driven\ndown through the forest like water forced through a sieve, and were\ngathered in the only open space discoverable.\n\nThere we cooled our heels, fearful and full of vague imaginings until\nMiss Vanderman should bring the women, not at all encouraged by shouts\nin the distance that well might be the exulting of plundering Kurds,\nnor by occasional rifle-shots that sounded continually nearer, nor\nby the angry crimson glow of burning roofs that lighted half\nthe horizon.\n\nWe waited an hour, Will objecting whenever either of us proposed\nto return and speed Miss Vanderman.\n\n\"Aw, what's the use?  D'you suppose she doesn't know we're waiting?\"\n\nAt last Fred proposed that Will himself go and investigate.  He went\nthrough the form of demurring, but yielded gracefully.\n\n\"The spirit,\" Fred chuckled, \"is weak, and the flesh is willing!\"\n\nWill handed his mule's reins to an Armenian and started alone up-hill\nthrough the pitch-dark forest;  and because the world is mixed of\nunexpectedness and grim jest in fairly equal proportions, five minutes\nafter he left us Gloria Vanderman came leading the women by\nanother path.\n\nTo avoid confusion with our part, and for sake of silence, she had\nled them a circuit, and except for the occasional wail of a child\nand a little low talking that blended like the hum of insects with\nthe night, they made very little noise.  The rear was brought up\nby the strongest women carrying the sick and wounded on litters that\nhad been improvised in a hurry, and like most things of\nthe sort were much too heavy.\n\n\"Your mule is ready,\" said I.  But she shook her head.\n\n\"You gentlemen must give your mules up to the sick and wounded.\nWe well ones can walk.\"\n\nI did not know how to answer her, although I knew she was wrong.\nThe way to organize a marching column is not to level down to the\nability of the weakest, although the pace of the weakest may have\nto be the measure of speed.  We, who had to protect the column and\nshepherd it, would need our mounts;  without them we should all be\nat the mercy of any enemy, with no corresponding gain to any one\nexcept the litter-bearers.  All the same, I did not care to take\nissue with that capable young woman then and there.  She would have\nput me in the wrong and left me speechless and indignant, after the\nfashion that is older than poor Shylock's tale.\n\nBut Fred is made of sterner stuff than I, and was never above amusing\nhimself at the expense of anybody's dignity.\n\n\"Will is the youngest,\" he answered.  \"Besides, he's keeping us all\nwaiting with his love-affairs!  He ought to be made to walk!\"\n\n\"His love-affairs?\"\n\n\"He went into the woods to see a woman,\" Fred answered imperturbably.\n\"Let him forfeit his mule.  Here he comes.  Did you find her, America?\"\n\nWill emerged out of gloom with a grin on his face.\n\n\"Just my luck!\" he said simply.  \"What are we waiting for?  I can\nhear the Kurds.  Let's start.\"\n\nAt that Gloria got excited.\n\n\"D'you mean you're willing to leave a woman behind alone in that\nforest?\" she demanded, and Will's jaw dropped.\n\nFred nudged my ribs.\n\n\"Come on!  We've given 'em a ground for their first quarrel.  They'll\nnever thank us if we wait a week.  Mount!  Walk--ride!\"\n\nWe sent our two Zeitoonli in advance to show the way.  True to his\nword, Arabaiji had left us, mule and all, and we missed him as we\nstrove to get the unwieldy column marshaled and moving in line.\nWe did not see Will and Gloria again that night, except when they\npassed between us, walking, arguing--Will explaining--we sitting\non our mules on either side of the track until the last of the swarm\ntailed by.  Then we brought up the rear together, to drive the stragglers\nand look out for pursuit.\n\n\"Not that I know what the devil we'll do if the Kurds get after us!\"\nsaid Fred.\n\n\"Let's hope they make for the castle to-night, and waste time plundering\nthat.\"\n\n\"Piffle!\" he answered.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because, you ass, if they get to the place and find if empty they'll\ndeduce, being less than idiots, that we're not far off and that we're\nat their mercy in the open!  Let's hope to God they funk attacking\nin the dark, and wait out of range of the walls until daylight.\nIn that case we've a chance.  Otherwise--I've still got six rifle\ncartridges, and four for my pistol.  How many have you?\"\n\n\"Six of each.\"\n\n\"Then you owe me one for my pistol.\"\n\nI passed it to him.\n\n\"So.  Now we're good for exactly twenty-two Kurds between us.  If\nwe're pursued I propose to give those two young lovers a chance by\nmaking every cartridge count from behind cover.\"\n\n\"They'd hear the shooting and--\"\n\n\"Not if we drop far enough behind.\"\n\n\"They'd hear shooting and Will, at any rate, would ride back.\"\n\n\"He couldn't!  He'd have to look after the girl and the column.\"\n\n\"All the same--Will's--\"\n\n\"I know he is.  Very well.  I'll arrange it another way.  You wait\nbehind here.\"\n\nSo I rode along slowly, and he spurred his horse to a trot.  But\nhe did not hold the trot long.  I could hear him objurgating, coaxing,\nencouraging, explaining, and the shrill voices of women answering,\nas he tried at one and the same time to pass the unfortunates in\nthe dark and to make them see the grim necessity for speed.  Soon\nI grew as busy as he, bullying litter-bearers and mothers burdened\nwith crying babies.  In times of massacre and war, survivors are\nnot necessarily those who enjoyed the best of it.  Nearly-drowned\nmen brought to life again would forego the process if the choice\nwere theirs, and there were nearly twenty women who would have preferred\ndeath to that night's march.  But I did not dare load my horse with\nbabies, since it would likely be needed before dawn for sterner work.\n\nIt was more than an hour before Fred loomed in sight again, standing\nbeside his horse in wait for me.  He, too, had resisted the temptation\nto relieve mothers of their living loads (not that they ever expected it).\n\n\"How did you manage?\" I asked, for I could tell by his air that the\nerrand had been successful.\n\n\"I lied to him.\"\n\n\"Of course.  What did you say?\"\n\n\"Said if the straggling got bad you and I might fall a long way behind\nand fire our pistols, so as to give the impression Kurds are in pursuit.\nThat would tickle up the rear-end to a run!\"\n\n\"And he believed that?\" Will knew as well as I Fred's not exactly\nsubtle way of maneuvering to get the post of greatest danger for himself.\n\n\"He'd have believed anything!  He's head-, heart-and heels-over-end\nin love with the girl, and she's as bad as he is.  They're talking\npolitical economy and international jurisprudence.  When I reached\n'em they'd just arrived at the conclusion that the United States\ncan save the world, maybe--maybe not, but nothing else can.  I was\ndecidedly de trop.  They're pretty to watch.  No, he hasn't kissed\nher yet--you could tell that even in the dark.  It's my belief he\nwon't for a long time;  America's way with women is beyond belief.\nThey're telling each other all they know, and like, and dislike,\nand believe, and hope.  It 'ud take a bullet to divide their destinies.\nI delivered my message, and they were so devilish polite you'd think\nI was the parson come to marry 'em.  They'd forgotten my very existence.\nWhen it dawned on 'em who I was they were so keen to be rid of me\nthey'd have agreed to anything at all.  So it was easy.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"No, it's bad.  Will's a friend of mine.  I hate to see him squandered\non a woman.  However, I did better than that.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\nAs I spoke there loomed out of the darkness just ahead of us eight\nmen surrounding something on the track, their rifles sticking up\nabove their shoulders.\n\n\"I've found eight men with rifles all alike that fit the ammunition\nin the boxes.  It's stolen Turkish government ammunition, by the\nway.  The rifles come from the same source.  The point is that a\nman caught with a stolen government rifle and ammunition in his\npossession would be tortured.  Incidentally the men seem game.\nTherefore, if we have to fight a rear-guard action we can reasonably\ncount on them.  Haide!\" he called to the eight men, and they picked\nup the case of cartridges, and resumed the march just ahead of us.\n\nFred lit his pipe contentedly, as he always is contented when he\ncan make satisfactory arrangements to sacrifice himself unselfishly\nand pretend to himself he is a cynic.  Whether because the armed\nguard of their own people put new courage in them, or because rifles\nat their rear made them more afraid, the stragglers gave less trouble\nfor the next few hours.  Perhaps they were growing more used to the\nmarch, and some of them were numb with anxiety, while not so weary\nyet that feet would not carry them forward.\n\nSomewhere in advance a man with a high tenor voice began to sing\na wild folk-song, of the sort that is common to all countries whose\nheritage is hope unstrangled.  He and others like him with love and\nmusic in their brave hearts sang the tortured column through its\nnight of agony, keeping alive faint hope that hell must have an end.\nDawn broke sweet and calm.  For it makes no matter if a nation writhes\nin agony, or man wreaks hate on man, the wind and the sky still whisper\nand smile;  and the scent of wild flowers is not canceled by the\nstench of tired humanity.\n\nFred knocked his pipe out and rode to the top of shoulder of rock\nbeside the track, beckoning to me to follow.  We could see our column,\nastonishingly long drawn, winding like a line of ants in and out\nand over, following the leaders in a dream because there seemed nothing\nelse to do or dream about.  Once I thought I caught sight of Will\non his horse, passing between trees, but I was not sure.  Fred turned\nhis horse about and looked in the direction we had come from.  Presently,\nhe nudged me.\n\n\"That smoke might be the castle we were in last night.  See--it's\nred underneath.  What'll you bet me Kurds don't show up in pursuit\nbefore the day's an hour old?\"\n\nThat was nothing to bet about, and that kind of dawn is not the hour\nfor roseate optimism.\n\n\"If they come,\" said I,  \"I hope I don't live to see what they'll\ndo to the women.\"\n\nFred met my eyes and laughed.\n\n\"That's all right,\" he said.  \"You ride on.  This rock commands the\ntrack.  I'll follow later when pursuit's called off.\"\n\n\"Ride on yourself!\" I answered, and he chuckled as he lighted his\npipe again.\n\nOne of the men had a kerosene can filled with odds and ends of personal\nbelongings.  I turned them out in a hollow of the rock, and sent\nhim to fill the can with drinking water at a spring.  Then Fred and\nI chose stations, and Fred went to vast pains lecturing every one\nof us on how to keep cover.  We had nothing to eat, and therefore\nno notion of putting up anything but a short fight.  Our best point\nwas the surprise that unexpected, organized resistance would be likely\nto produce on plundering Kurds.\n\nIt was pleasant enough where we lay, and reminded both of us of far\nless strenuous days.  The little animals that are always curious\nto the point of their undoing came out and investigated our tracks\nas soon as the noise of the stragglers had ceased.  The Armenians\ntook no notice of the wild life;  persecuted people seldom do, having\ntheir own hard case too much in mind;  but Fred knew the name of\nnearly every bird and animal that showed itself, and even ceased\nsmoking as his interest increased.\n\n\"Ever go fishing as a boy?\" he asked.\n\n\"Didn't I!\"\n\n\"Get up before daylight and escape from the house by the back way--\"\n\n\"Stealing bread and cheese from the pantry on the way out--\"\n\n\"And stopping where the grass was long near the watering place to\ndig worms--\"\n\n\"And unchain the dog with frantic efforts to keep him from barking--\"\n\n\"Yes, but the rascal always would do it--bark and wake everybody!\nLucky if nobody saw you as you slipped through the gate into the fields!\"\n\n\"Ah!  But then what a time the dog had--it was almost as good fun\nas the fishing to watch him scamper.  And how hungry he got--and\nhe ate more than his share of the bread and cheese, so that you'd\nhave had to go home early because of the aching void if it hadn't\nbeen for the cottage where they gave a fellow milk out of a brown dish.\"\n\n\"Yumm!  Didn't that country milk taste good!  Snff--snff--they were\nmornings just like this at home when I went fishing.  Cool and sweet\nand full of scent.  Snff--snff!\"\n\nWe sat still behind the ledge and let the air and scenery revive\nkind memories.  The only noise was what our horses made cropping\nthe grass in a hollow behind us, for the Armenians were well content\nto ruminate.  Most likely they would have fallen asleep if we had\nnot been there to keep an eye on them, for prolonged subjection to\ntoo much fear is soporific, so that tortured poor wretches sleep\non the tightened rack.\n\nI was very nearly asleep myself, having had practically none of it\nfor two nights in succession, and had taken to watching the horses\nto keep my mind busy, when the movement of my horse's ears struck\nme as peculiar.  Presently he ceased grazing and raised his head.\nI thought he was going to whinny, and turned to see Fred squinting\ndown his rifle at something that was not in the range of my vision.\n\n\"Here they come!\" he whispered.\n\nAs he spoke a Kurd stepped out from between the trees, and we could\nsee that he had tied his horse to a branch in the gloom behind him.\nHe had the long sleeves reaching nearly to the ground peculiar to\nhis race, and the unmistakable sheeny nose and cruel lips.  From\nthe rifle that he carried cavalierly over his shoulder hung a woman's\nundergarment, with a dark stain on it that looked suspiciously like\nblood.  My horse whinnied then, and his beast answered.  At that\nhe brought his rifle to the \"ready\" and nearly jumped out of his skin.\n\n\"I'm judge, jury, witness, prosecutor and executioner!\" Fred whispered.\n\"That man's dose is death, and he dies unshriven!\"\n\nThen he fired, and Fred could not miss at that range if he tried.\nThe Kurd clapped a hand to his throat and fell backward, and one\nof our Armenians ran before we could stop him to seize the tied horse,\nand any other plunder.  One of the things he brought back with him,\nbesides the horse and rifle and ammunition belt, was a woman's finger\nwith the ring not yet removed.  He said he found it in the\ncartridge pouch.\n\nIn proof that organized defense was the last thing they reckoned\non, nine more Kurds came galloping down the track pell-mell toward\nthe place where they had heard the solitary rifle-shot, doubtless\nsupposing their own man had come upon the quarry.  We fired too fast,\nfor the Armenians were not drilled men, but we dropped two horses\nand five Kurds, and the remaining four fled, with the riderless animals\nstampeding in their wake.\n\n\"What next?\"' said I, as Fred wiped out his rifle-barrel.\n\n\"They'll return in greater force.  We'd better change ground.  D'you\nnotice how this rock is covered by that other one a quarter of a\nmile to the right?  Higher ground, too, and the last place they'll\nlook--come on!\"\n\nThe man with the water-can spilled it all, for the sake of his medley\nof possessions, and I had to send him all the way back for more.\nBut we took up our new stand at last with the horses well hidden\nand enough to drink to last the day out, and then had to wait half\nan hour before any Kurds came back to the attack.\n\nThey came on the second time with infinite precaution, lurking among\nthe trees on the outskirts of the clearing and firing several random\nshots at our old position in the hope of drawing our fire.  Finally,\nthey emerged from the forest thirty strong and rushed our supposed\nhiding-place at full gallop.\n\nThey were not even out of pistol range.  Fred used the Mauser rifle\ntaken from the dead Kurd, and then we both emptied our pistols at\nthe fools, the Armenians meanwhile keeping up a savage independent\nfire so ragged and rapid that it might have been the battle of Waterloo.\n\nThe Kurds never knew whether or not we were another party or the\nfirst one.  They never discovered whether our former post was deserted\nor not.  We never knew how many of them we hit, for after about a\ndozen had tumbled out of the saddle the remainder galloped for their\nlives.  For minutes afterward we heard them crashing and pounding\naway in the distance to find their friends.\n\nOur loot consisted of two wounded prisoners and four good horses,\nin addition to rifles and cartridges.  We let the dead lie where\nthey were for a warning to other scoundrels, and we looked on while\nour Armenians searched the bodies for anything likely to be of slightest\nuse.  They found almost nothing originally Kurdish, but more Armenian\ntrinkets than would have stocked a traveling merchant's show-case,\nincluding necklaces and earrings.\n\nFred took the two prisoners aside and in Persian, which every Kurd\ncan understand and speak after a fashion, offered them their choice\nbetween telling the whole truth or being handed over to Armenians.\nAnd as there isn't a bloody rascal in the world but suspects his\nintended victims of worse hankerings than his own, they loosed their\ntongues and told more than the truth, adding whatever they thought\nlikely to please Fred.\n\n\"They say there were only about fifty of them in this raiding party\nto begin with, and several came to trouble before they met us.  Seems\nthere are Armenians hidden here and there who are able to give an\naccount of themselves.  Ten or twelve elected to stay near the castle\nwe were in last night.  They've burned it, but they have some captured\nwomen and propose to enjoy themselves.  Shall we ride back and break\nin on the party?\"\n\nHe meant what he said, but it was out of the question.  \"The party\nwe've just trounced will give the alarm,\" I objected.  \"We'd only\nride into a trap.  Besides, you've no proof these prisoners are not\nlying to you.\"\n\n\"They say their raiding party is the only one within thirty miles.\nThey rode ahead of the regiments to get first picking.\"\n\n\"We're none of us fit for anything but food and sleep,\" said I, and\nFred had to concede the point.\n\nFortunately the food problem was solved for the moment by the Kurds,\nwho had a sort of cheese with them whose awful taste deprived one\nof further appetite.  We ate, and tied our two wounded prisoners\non one horse;  and as we had nothing to treat their wounds with except\nwater they finished their trip in exquisite discomfort.  Surprise\nthat we should attend to their wounds at all, added to their despondency\nafter they had time to consider what it meant.  There was only one\nburden to their lamentation:\n\n\"What are you going to do with us?  We will tell what we know!  We\nwill name names!  We are your slaves!  We kiss feet!  Ask, and we\nwill answer!\"\n\nThey thought they were being kept alive for torture, and we let them\nkeep on thinking it.  Fred tied their horse to his own saddle and\ntowed them along, singing at the top of his lungs to keep the rest\nof us awake;  and for all his noise I fell asleep until he reached\nfor his concertina and, the humor of the situation dawning on him,\ncommenced a classic of his own composition, causing the morning to\nre-echo with irreverence, and making all of us except the prisoners\naware of the fact that life is not to be taken seriously, even in\nArmenia.  The prisoners intuitively guessed that the song had reference\nto ways and means they would rather have forgotten.\n\n\"Ow! My name it is 'orrible 'Enery 'Emms,\nAnd I 'ails from a 'ell of a 'ole!\nThe things I 'ave thought an' the deeds I 'ave did\nAre remarkable lawless an' better kep' hid,\nSo if Morgan you think of, an' Sharkey an' Kidd,\nForget 'em!  To name such beginners as them's\nAn insult, so shivver my soul!  Yow!\nIn every port o' the whole seven seas\nI 'ave two or three wives on the rates,\nFor I'm free wi' my fancy an' fly wi' my picks,\nAnd I've promised 'em plenty, an' given 'em nix,\nBut have left ev'ry one in a 'ell of a fix!\n'Ooever said Bluebeard was brother to me's\nEither jealous or misunderstates!\n\n\"Wow!  For awful atrocity, murder an' theft,\nFor battery, arson and hate,\nFrom breakin' the Sabbath to coveting cows,\nAn' false affidavits an' perjurin' vows,\nI'm adept at whatever the law disallows,\nAnd the gallowsmen gape at the noose that I left,\nFor I flit while the bally fools wait!\"\n\nFred kept us awake all right.  Like most of his original songs, that\none had sixty or seventy verses.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twelve\n\"America's way with a woman is beyond belief!\"\n\n\nCUI  BONO?\n\nDid caution keep the gates of Greece,\nYe saints of \"safety first!\"\nTwixt Thessaly and Locris when\nLeonidas' thousand men\nDied scornful of the proffered peace\nOf Xerxes the accurst?\nWatch ye have kept, ward ye have kept,\nBut watch and ward were vain\nIf love and gratitude have slept\nWhile ye stood guard for gain.\n\nOr ye, who count the niggard cost\nIn time and coin and gear\nOf succoring the under-dog,\nHow often have ye seen a hog,\nEstablishing his glutton boast,\nSurvive a famine year?\nFast ye have kept, feast ye have made;\nVain were the deeds and doles\nIf it was fear that ye obeyed\nTo save your coward souls.\n\nYe banish beauty to the stews\nFor lack of eyes that see,\nAnd stifle joy with deadly rote\nAs empty as the texts ye quote,\nThe while forgiveness ye refuse\nLest wrath dishonored be.\nGray are your days, drab are your ways,\nStrong are your fashioned bars,\nBut, ye who ask if service pays--\nWho polishes the stars?\n\n\nSpring in Armenia is almost as much like heaven as heaven itself\ncould be, if it were not for the unspeakable Turk, but his blight\nrests on everything.  I could have kept awake that morning without\nFred's irreverent music, simply for sake of the scenery, if its freshness\nhad been untainted.  But there hung a sickly, faint pall of smoke\nthat robbed the green landscape of all liveliness.  One breathed\nweariness instead of wine.\n\nWe could not possibly have lost the way, because our crawling column\nhad left a swath behind it of trampled grass and trodden crossing-places\nwhere the track wound and rewound in a game of hide-and-seek with\ntinkling streams.  But we began to wonder, nevertheless, why we caught\nup with nobody.\n\nIt was drawing on to ten in the morning, and I had dozed off for\nabout the dozenth time, with my horse in pretty much the same condition,\nwhen I heard Will's voice at last, and looked up.  He was standing\nalone on a ledge overlooking the track, but I could see the ends\nof rifles sticking up close by.  If we had been an enemy, we should\nhave stood small chance against him.\n\n\"Where are the rest of you?\" I asked, and he laughed!\n\n\"Women, kids and wounded all swore a pitched battle was raging behind\nthem.  Most of them wanted to turn back and lend a hand.  I thought\nyou guys mighty cruel to put all that scare into a crowd in their\ncondition--but I see--\"\n\n\"Guests, America!  My country's at peace with Turkey!  Where shall\nwe stow our guests?\"\n\n\"There's a village below here.\"\n\nHe jerked a thumb over his shoulder.  But behind him was the apex\nof a spur thrust out in midcurve of the mountainside, and one could\nnot see around that.  We had emerged out of the straggling outposts\nof the forest high above the plain, and to our right the whole panorama\nlay snoozing in haze.  The path by which we had turned our backs\non Monty and Kagig went winding away and away below, here and there\nan infinitesimal thin line of slightly lighter color, but more often\nsuggested by the contour of the hills.  Our Zeitoonli in their zeal\nto return to their leader had been evidently cutting corners.  If\nthe smudge of smoke to the right front overhung Marash, then we were\nprobably already nearer Zeitoon than when we and Kagig parted company.\n\n\"Come up and see for yourselves,\" said Will.\n\nFred passed the line that held his prisoners in tow to an Armenian,\nand we climbed up together on foot.  Around the corner of the spur,\nwithin fifty feet of where Will stood, was an almost sheer escarpment,\nand at the foot of that, a thousand feet below us, with ramparts\nof living rock on all four sides, crouched a little village fondled\nin the bosom of the mountains.\n\n\"They've piled down there and made 'emselves at home.  The place\nwas deserted, prob'ly because it 'ud be too easy to roll rocks down\ninto it.  But I can't make 'em listen.  Ours is a pretty chesty lot,\nwith guts, and our taking part with 'em has stiffened their courage.\nThey claim they're goin' to hold this rats' nest against all the\nTurks and Kurds in Asia Minor!\"\n\n\"That's where the rest of us are,\" said Will\n\n\"Where's Miss Vanderman?\"\n\n\"Asleep--down in the village.  The're all asleep.  You guys go down\nthere and sleep, too.  I'll follow, soon as I've posted these men\non watch.  That small square hut next the big one in the middle is\nours.  She's in the big one with a crowd of women.  Now don't make\na fool row and wake her!  Tie your horses in the shade where you\nsee the others standing in line;  there's a little corn for them,\nand a lot of hay that the owners left behind.\"\n\nSo we undertook not to wake the lady, and left Will there carefully\nchoosing places, in which the men fell fast asleep almost the minute\nhis back was turned.  Sleep was in the air that morning--not mere\nweariness of mind and limb that a man could overcome, but inexplicable\ncoma.  Whole armies are affected that way on occasion.  There was\na man once named Sennacherib.\n\n\"Sleepy hollow!\" said Fred, and as he spoke his horse pitched forward,\nalmost spilling him;  the rope that held the prisoners in tow was\nall that saved the lot of them from rolling down-hill.  Fred dismounted,\nand drove the horse in front of him with a slap on the rump, but\nthe beast was almost too sleepy to make the effort to descend.\n\nThere was no taint of gas or poison fumes.  The air tasted fresh\nexcept for the faint smoke, and the birds were all in full song.\nYet we all had to dismount, and to let the prisoners walk, too, because\nthe horses were too drowsy to be trusted.  The path that zigzagged\ndownward to the village was dangerous enough without added risk,\nand the eight Armenian riflemen refused point-blank to lead the way\nunless they might drive the animals ahead of them.\n\nEven so, neither we nor they were properly awake, when we reached\nthe village.  We tied up the horses in a sort of dream--fed them\nfrom instinct and habit--and made our way to the hut Will had pointed\nout like men who walked in sleep.\n\nNobody was keeping watch.  Nobody noticed our arrival.  Men and women\nwere sleeping in the streets and under the eaves of the little houses.\nNothing seemed awake but the stray dogs nosing at men's feet and\nhunting hopelessly among the bundles.\n\nThe little house Will had reserved for our use contained a stool\nand a string-cot.  On the stool was food--cheese and very dry bread;\nand because even in that waking dream we were conscious of hunger,\nwe ate a little of it.   Then we lay down on the floor and fell\nasleep--we, and the prisoners, and the eight Armenian riflemen.\nWithin a quarter of an hour Will followed us into the house, but\nwe knew nothing about that.  Then he, too, fell asleep, and until\ntwo or three hours after dark we were a village of the dead.\n\nTo this day there is no explaining it.  Certainly no human watch\nor ward saved us from destruction at the hands of roving enemies.\nI was awakened at last by a brilliant light, and the effort made\nby our two prisoners, still tied together, to crawl across my body.\nI threw them off me, and sat up, rubbing my eyes and wondering where\nI was.\n\nIn the door stood Kagig, with a lantern in his right hand thrust\nforward into the room.  His eyes were ablaze with excitement, and\nbetween black beard and mustache his teeth showed in a grin mixed\nof scorn and amusement.\n\nNext I beard Will's voice:  \"Jimminy!\" and Will sat up.  Then Fred\ngave tongue:\n\n\"That you, Kagig?  Where's Monty?  Where's Lord Montdidier?\"\n\nKagig strode into the room, set the lantern on the floor, struck\nthe remnants of the food from off the little stool, and sat down.\nI could see now that he was deathly tired.\n\n\"He is in Zeitoon,\" he answered.\n\nNoises from outside began then to assert themselves in demonstration\nthat the village was awake at last--also that the population had\nswollen while we slept.  I could hear the restless movement of more\nthan twice the number of horses we had had with us.\n\nKagig began to laugh--a sort of dry cackle that included wonder as\nwell as rebuke.  He threw both hands outward, palms upward, in a\ngesture that complemented the motion of shoulders shrugged up to\nhis ears.\n\n\"All around--high hills!  From every side from fifty places rocks\ncould have been rolled upon you!  So--and so you sleep!\"\n\n\"I set guards!\" Will exploded.\n\n\"Eleven guards I found--all together in one place--fast asleep!\"\n\nHe showed his splendid teeth and the palms of his hands again in\nactual enjoyment of the situation.  For the first time then I saw\nthere was wet blood on his goat-skin coat.\n\n\"Kagig--you're wounded!\"\n\nHe made a gesture of impatience.\n\n\"It is nothing--nothing.  My servant has attended to it.\"\n\nSo Kagig had a servant.  I felt glad of that.  It meant a rise from\nvagabondage to position among his people.\n\nOf all earthly attainments, the first and most desirable and last\nto let go of is an honest servant--unless it be a friend.  (But the\ndifference is not so distinct as it sounds.)\n\nA huge fear suddenly seized Fred Oakes.\n\n\"You said Monty is in Zeitoon--alive or dead?  Quick, man!  Answer!\"\n\n\"Should I leave Zeitoon,\" Kagig answered slowly, unless I left a\nbetter man in charge behind me?  He is alive in Zeitoon--alive--alive!\nHe is my brother!  He and I love one purpose with a strong love that\nshall conquer!  You speak to me of Lord what-is-it?  Hah!  To me\nforever he is Monty, my brother--my--\"\n\n\"Where's Miss Vanderman?\" I interrupted.\n\n\"Here!\" she said quietly, and I turned my head to discover her sitting\nbeside Will in the shadow cast by Kagig's lantern.  She must have\nentered ahead of Kagig or close behind him, unseen because of his\nbulk and the tricky light that he swung in his right hand.\n\nKagig went on as if he had not heard me.\n\n\"There is a castle--I think I told you?--perched on a crag in the\nforest beside Zeitoon.  My men have cut a passage to it through the\ntrees, for it had stood forgotten for God knows how long.  Later\nyou shall understand.  There came Arabaiji, riding a mule to death,\nsaying you and this lady are in danger of life at the hands of my\nnation.  I did not believe that, but Monty--he believed it.\"\n\n\"And I'll wager you found him a hot handful!\" laughed Fred.\n\"Not so hot.  Not so hot.  But very determined.  Later you shall\nunderstand.  He and I drove a bargain.\"\n\n\"Dammit!\" Fred rose to his feet.  \"D'you mean you used our predicament\nas a club to drive him with?\"\n\nKagig laughed dryly.\n\n\"Do you know your friend so little, and think so ill of me?  He named\nterms, and I agreed to them.  I took a hundred mounted men to find\nyou and bring you to Zeitoon, spreading them out like a fan, to scour\nthe country.  Some fell in with a thing the Turks call a hamidieh\nregiment;  that is a rabble of Kurds under the command of Tenekelis.\"\n\n\"What are they?\"\n\n\"Tenekelis?  The word means 'tin-plate men.'  We call them that because\nof the tin badges given them to wear in their head-dress.  In no\nother way do they resemble officers.  They are brigands favored by\nofficial recognition, that is all.  Their purpose is to pillage\nArmenians.  While you slept in this village, and your watchmen slept\nup above there, that whole rabble of bandits with their tin-plate\nofficers passed within half a mile, following along the track by\nwhich you came!  If you had been awake--and cooking--or singing--or\nmaking any sort of noise they must have heard you!  Instead, they\nturned down toward the plain a little short distance too soon--and\nmy men met them--and there was a skirmish--and I rallied my other\nmen, and attacked them suddenly.  We accounted for two of the tin-plate\nmen, and so many of the thing they call a regiment that the others\ntook to flight.  Jannam!  (My soul!)  But you are paragons of sleepers!\"\n\n\"Do you never sleep?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Shall a man keep watch over a nation, and sleep?\" he answered.\n\"Aye--here a little, there a little, I snatch sleep when I can.\nMy heart burns in me.  I shall sleep on my horse on the way back\nto Zeitoon, but the burning within will waken me by fits and starts.\"\n\nHe got up and stood very politely in front of Gloria Vanderman,\nremoving his cossack kalpak for the first time and holding it with\na peculiar suggestion of humility.\n\n\"You shall be put to no indignity at the hands of my people,\" he\nsaid.  \"They are not bad people, but they have suffered, and some\nhave been made afraid.  They would have kept you safe.  But now you\nshall have twenty men if you wish, and they shall deliver you safely\ninto Tarsus.  If you wish it, I will send one of these gentlemen\nwith you to keep you in countenance before my men;  they are foreigners\nto you, and no one could blame you for fearing them.  The gentleman\nwould not wish to go, but I would send him!\"\n\nShe shook her head, pretty merrily for a girl in her predicament.\n\n\"I was curious to meet you, Mr. Kagig, but that's nothing to the\nattraction that draws me now.  I must meet the other man--is it Monty\nyou all call him--or never know a moment's peace!\"\n\n\"You mean you will not go to Tarsus?\"\n\n\"Of course I won't!\"\n\n\"Of course!\" laughed Fred.  \"Any young woman--\"\n\n\"Of course?\" Kagig repeated the extravagant gesture of shrugged shoulders\nand up-turned palms.  \"Ah, well.  You are American.  I will not argue.\nWhat would be the use?\"\n\nHe turned his back on us and strode out with that air that not even\nthe great stage-actors can ever acquire, of becoming suddenly and\nutterly oblivious of present company in the consciousness of deeds\nthat need attention.  Generals of command, great captains of industry,\nand a few rare statesmen have it;  but the statesmen are most rare,\nbecause they are trained to pretend, and therefore unconvincing.\nThe generals and captains are detested for it by all who have never\nhumbled themselves to the point where they can think, and be unselfishly\nabsorbed.  Kagig stepped out of one zone of thought into the next,\nand shut the door behind him.\n\nA minute later we heard his voice uplifted in command, and the business\nof shepherding those women and children was taken out of our hands\nby a man who understood the business.  The intoxicating sounds that\narmed men make as they evolve formation out of chaos in the darkness\ncame in through open door and windows, and in another moment Kagig\nwas back again with a hand on each door-post.\n\n\"You have brought all those cartridges!\"\n\nHe thrust out both hands in front of him, and made the knuckles of\nevery finger crack like castanets.  In another second he was gone\nagain.  But we knew we were now forgiven all our sins of omission.\n\nSomewhere about midnight, with a nearly full moon rising in a golden\ndream above the rim of the ravine, we started.  And no wheeled vehicle\ncould have followed by the track we took.  It was no mean task for\nmen on foot, and our burdened animals had to be given time.  Whether\nor not Kagig slept, as he had said he would, on horse-back, he kept\nhimself and our prisoners out of sight somewhere in the van;  and\nthis time the rear was brought up by a squadron of ragged irregular\nhorse that would have made any old campaigner choke with joy to look\nat them.\n\nDrill those men knew very little of--only sufficient to make it possible\nto lead them.  No two men were dressed alike, and some were not even\narmed alike, although stolen Turkish government rifles far predominated.\nBut they wore unanimously that dare-devil air, not swaggering because\nthere is no need, that has been the key to most of the sublime surprises\nof all war.  The commander, whose men sit that way in the saddle\nand toss those jokes shoulder over shoulder down the line, dare tackle\nforlorn hopes that would seem sheer leap-year lunacy to the martinet\nwith twenty times their number.\n\n\"Who'd have thought it?\" said Fred.  \"We've all heard the Turk was\na first-class fighting man, but I'd rather command fifty of these,\nthan any five hundred Turks I ever saw.\n\nThere was no gainsaying that.  Whoever had seen armies with an\nunderstanding eye must have agreed.\n\n\"Turks don't hate Armenians for their faults,\" I answered.  \"From\nwhat I know of the Turk he likes sin, and prefers it cardinal.  If\nArmenians were mere degenerates, or murdering ruffians like the Kurds,\nthe Turk would like them.\"\n\nFred laughed.\n\n\"Then if a Turk liked me, you'd doubt my social fitness?\"\n\n\"Sure I would, if he liked you well enough to attract attention.\nThe fact that the Turk hates Armenians is the best advertisement\nArmenians have got.\"\n\nWe were entering the heart of savage hills that tossed themselves\nin ever increasing grandeur up toward the mist-draped crags of Kara\nDagh, following a trail that was mostly watercourse.  The simple\nsavagery of the mountains laid naked to view in the liquid golden\nlight stirred the Armenians behind us to the depths of thought;\nand theirs is a consciousness of warring history;  of dominion long\nsince taken from them, and debauched like pearls by swine;  of hope,\neternally upwelling, born of love of their trampled fatherland.\nThey began to sing, and the weft and woof of their songs were grief\nfor all those things and a cherished, secret promise that a limit\nhad been set to their nation's agony.\n\nIn his own way, with his chosen, unchaste instrument Fred is a musician\nof parts.  He can pick out the spirit of old songs, even when, as\nthen, he hears them for the first time, and make his concertina interpret\nthem to wood and wind and sky.  Indoors he is a mere accompanist,\nand in polite society his muse is dumb.  But in the open, given fair\nexcuse and the opportunity, he can make such music as compels men's\nears and binds their hearts with his in common understanding.\n\nBecause of Fred's concertina, quite without knowing it, those Armenians\nopened their hearts to us that night, so that when a day of testing\ncame they regarded us unconsciously as friends.  Taught by the atrocity\nof cruel centuries to mistrust even one another, they would surely\nhave doubted us otherwise, when crisis came.  Nobody knows better\nthan the Turk how to corrupt morality and friendship, and Armenia\nis honeycombed with the rust of mutual suspicion.  But real music\nis magic stuff.  No Turk knows any magic.\n\nAt dawn, twisting and zigzagging in among the ribs of rock-bound\nhills, we sighted the summit of Beirut Dagh all wreathed in jeweled\nmist.  Then the only life in sight except ourselves was eagles,\nnervously obsessed with goings-on on the horizon.  I counted as many\nas a dozen at one time, wheeling swiftly, and circling higher for\na wider view, but not one swooped to strike.\n\nOnce, as we turned into a track that they told us led to El Oghlu,\nwe saw on a hill to our left a small square building, gutted by fire.\nTwenty yards away from it, on top of the same round hill, strange\nfruit was hanging from a larger oak than any we had seen\nthereabouts--fruit that swung unseemly in the tainted wind.\n\n\"Turks!\" announced one of Kagig's men, riding up to brag to us.\n\"That square building is the guard-house for the zaptieh, put there\nby the government to keep check on robbers.  They are the worst robbers!\"\n\nThe man spoke English with the usual mission-school air suggestive\nof underdone pie.  As a rule they go to school at such great sacrifice,\nand then so limited for funds, that they have to get by heart three\ntimes the amount an ordinary, undriven youth can learn in the allotted\ntime.  But by heart they have it.  And like the pie they call to\nmind, only the surface of their talk is pale.  Because their heart\nis in the thing, they under-stand.\n\n\"By hanging Turkish police,\" said Fred, \"you only give the Turks\na good excuse for murdering your friends.\"\n\n\"Come!\" said the man of Zeitoon. \"See.\"\n\nHe led the way down a path between young trees to a clearing where\na swift stream gamboled in the sun.  Down at the end of it, where\nthe grass sloped gently upward toward the flanks of a great rock\nwas a little row of graves with a cross made of sticks at the head\nof each--clearly not Turkish graves.\n\n\"Three men--eleven women,\" our guide said simply.\n\n\"You mean that the Turkish police--\"\n\n\"There were fifteen on their way to Zeitoon.  One survived, and\nreached Zeitoon, and told.  Then he died, and we rode down to avenge\nthem all.  The Turks took the three men and beat them on the feet\nwith sticks until the soles of their feet swelled up and burst.\nThen they made them walk on their tortured feet.  Then they beat\nthem to death.  Shall I say what they did to the women?\"\n\n\"What did you do to the Turks?\" said I.\n\n\"Hanged them.  We are not animals--we simply, hanged them.\"\n\nSomewhere about noon we rode down a gorge into the village of El\nOghlu.  It was a miserable place, with a miserable, tiny kahveh in\nthe midst of it, and Kagig set that alight before our end of the\ncolumn came within a quarter of a mile of it.  We burned the rest\nof the village, for he sent back Ephraim to order no shelter left\nfor the regiments that would surely come and hunt us down.  But the\nbusiness took time, and we were farther than ever behind Kagig when\nthe last wooden roof began to cockle and crack in the heat.\n\nWill and Gloria were somewhere on in front, and Fred and I began\nto put on speed to try to overtake them.  But from the time of leaving\nthe burned village of El Oghlu there began to be a new impediment.\n\n\"We are not taking the shortest way,\" said Ephraim.  \"The shortest\nway is too narrow--good for one or two men in a hurry, but not for\nall of us.\"\n\nWe were gaining no speed by taking the easier road.  There began\nto be vultures in evidence, mostly half-gorged, flopping about from\none orgy to the next.  And out from among the rocks and bushes there\ncame fugitive Armenians--famished and wounded men and women, clinging\nto our stirrups and begging for a lift on the way to Zeitoon.  Zeitoon\nwas their one hope.  They were all headed that way.\n\nFred detached a dozen mounted men to linger behind on guard against\npursuit, and the rest of us overloaded our horses with women and\nchildren, giving up all hope of overtaking Gloria and Will, forgetting\nthat they had come first on the scene.  In my mind I imagined them\nriding side by side, Will with his easy cowboy seat, and Gloria looking\nlike a boy except for the chestnut hair.  But that imagination went\nthe way of other vanities.\n\nThere was neither pleasure nor advantage in striding slowly beside\nmy laboring horse, nor any hope of mounting him again myself.  So\nI walked ahead and, being now horseless, ceased to be mobbed by\nfugitives.  At the end of an hour I overtook two horses loaded with\nlittle children;  but there was no sign of Gloria and Will, and losing\nzest for the pursuit as the sun grew stronger I sat down by the ways-side\non a fallen tree.\n\nIt was then that I heard voices that I recognized.  The first was\na woman's.\n\n\"I'm simply crazy to know him.\"\n\nA man's, that I could not mistake even amid the roar of a city, answered\nher.\n\n\"You've a treat in store.  Monty is my idea of a regular he-man.\"\n\n\"Is he good-looking?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Stands and looks like a soldier.  I've seen a plainsman in\nWyoming who'd have matched him to a T all except the parted hair\nand the mustache.\"\n\n\"I like a mustache on a tall man.\"\n\n\"It suits Monty.  The first idea you get of him is strength--strength\nand gentleness;  and it grows on you as you know him better.  It's\nnot just muscles, nor yet will-power, but strength that makes your\nheart flutter, and you know for a moment how a woman must feel when\na fellow asks her to be his wife.  That's Monty.\"\n\nI got up and retraced a quarter of a mile, to wait for Fred where\nI could not accuse myself of \"listening in.\"\n\n\"Fred,\" I said, when he overtook me at last and we strode along side\nby side, \"you were right.  America's way with a woman is beyond belief!\"\n\nI told him what I had heard, and he thought a while.\n\n\"How about Maga Jhaere's way, when she and Will and the Vanderman\nmeet?\" he said at last, smiling grimly.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Thirteen\n\"'Take your squadron and go find him, Rustum Khan!'  And I, sahib,\nobeyed my lord bahadur's orders.\"\n\n\n\"TO-MORROW  WE  DIE\"\n\nAll that is cynical;  all that refuses\nTrust in an altruist aim;\nEvery specious plea that excuses\nGreed in necessity's name;\nStudied indifference;  scorn that amuses;\nCleverness, shifting the blame;\nSelfishness, pitying trust it abuses--\nTreason and these are the same.\nFinally, when the last lees ye shall turn from\n(E'en intellectuals flinch in the end!)\nAshes of loneliness then ye shall learn from--\nAll that's worth keeping's the faith of a friend.\n\n\nNever to be forgotten is that journey to Zeitoon.  We threaded toward\nthe heart of opal mountains along tracks that nothing on wheels--not\neven a wheel-barrow--could have followed.  Perpetually on our right\nthere kept appearing brilliant green patches of young rice, more\nfull of livid light than flawless emeralds.  And, as in all rice\ncountry, there were countless watercourses with frequently impracticable\nbanks along which fugitives felt their way miserably, too fearful\nof pursuit to risk following the bridle track.\n\nThere is a delusion current that fugitives go fast.  But it stands\nto reason they do not;  least of all, unarmed people burdened with\nchildren and odds and ends of hastily snatched household goods.\nWe found them hiding everywhere to sleep and rest lacerated feet,\nand there was not a mile of all that distance that did not add twenty\nor thirty stragglers to our column, risen at sight of us out of their\nlurking places.  We scared at least as many more into deeper hiding,\nwithout blame to them, for there was no reason why they should know\nus at a distance from official murderers.  Hamidieh regiments, the\nmilitia of that land, wear uniforms of their own choosing, which\nis mostly their ordinary clothes and weapons added.\n\nWith snow-crowned Beirut Dagh frowning down over us, and the track\ngrowing every minute less convenient for horse or man, word came\nfrom the rear that the hamidieh were truly on our trail.  Then we\nhad our first real taste of what Armenians could do against drilled\nTurks, and even before Fred and I could get in touch with Will and\nGloria we realized that whether or not we took part with them there\nwas going to be no stampede by the men-folk.\n\nNothing would persuade Gloria to go on to Zeitoon and announce our\ncoming.  Kagig came galloping back and found us four met together\nby a little horsetail waterfall.  He ordered her peremptorily to\nhurry and find Monty, but she simply ignored him.  In another moment\nhe was too bent on shepherding the ammunition cases to give her a\nfurther thought.\n\nMen began to gather around him, and he to issue orders.  They had\neither to kill him or obey.  He struck at them with a rawhide whip,\nand spurred his horse savagely at every little clump of men disposed\nto air their own views.\n\n\"You see,\" he laughed, \"unanimity is lacking!\"  Then his manner changed\nback to irritation.  \"In the name of God, effendim, what manner of\nsportmen are you?  Will not each of you take a dozen men and go and\ndestroy those cursed Turks?\"  (They call every man a Turk in that\nland who thinks and acts like one, be he Turk, Arab, Kurd or Circassian.)\n\nIt was all opposed to the consul's plan, and lawless by any reckoning.\nTo attack the troops of a country with which our own governments\nwere not at war was to put our heads in a noose in all likelihood.\nPerhaps if he had called us by any other name than \"sportmen\" we\nmight have seen it in that light, and have told him to protect us\naccording to contract.  But he used the right word and we jumped\nat the idea, although Gloria, who had no notions about international\ndiplomacy, was easily first with her hat in the ring.\n\n\"I'll lead some men!\" she shouted.  \"Who'll follow me?\"  Her voice\nrang clear with the virtue won on college playing fields.\n\n\"Nothing to it!\" Will insisted promptly.  \"Here, you, Kagig--I'll\nmake a bargain with you!\"\n\n\"Watch!\" Fred whispered.  \"Will is now going to sell two comrades\nin the market for his first love!  D'you blame him?  But it\nwon't work!\"\n\n\"Send Miss Vanderman to Zeitoon with an escort and we three--\"\n\n\"What did I tell you?\" Fred chuckled.\n\n\"--will fight for you all you like!\"\n\nBut Gloria had a dozen men already swarming to her, with never a\nsymptom of shame to be captained by a woman;  and others were showing\nsigns of inclination.  She turned her back on us, and I saw three\nmen hustle a fourth, who had both feet in bandages, until he gave\nher his rifle and bandolier.  She tossed him a laugh by way of\ncompensation, and he seemed content, although he had parted with\nmore than the equivalent of a fortune.\n\n\"That girl,\" said Kagig, from the vantage point of his great horse,\n\"is like the brave Zeitoonli wives!  They fight!  They can lead in\na pinch!  They are as good as men--better than men, for they think\nthey know less!\"\n\nFred swiftly gathered himself a company of his own, the older men\nelecting to follow his lead.  Gloria had the cream of the younger\nones--men who in an earlier age would have gone into battle wearing\na woman's glove or handkerchief--twenty or thirty youths blazing\nwith the fire of youth.  Will went hot-foot after her with most of\nthe English-speaking contingent from the mission schools.  Kagig\nhad the faithful few who had rallied to him from the first--the fighting\nmen of Zeitoon proper, including all the tough rear-guard who had\nsent the warning and remained faithfully in touch with the enemy\nuntil their chief should come.\n\nThat left for me the men who knew no English, and Ephraim was enough\nof a politician to see the advantage to himself of deserting Fred's\nstandard for mine;  for Fred could talk Armenian, and give his own\norders, but I needed an interpreter.  I welcomed him at the first\nexchange of compliments, but met him eye to eye a second later and\nbegan to doubt.\n\n\"I'm going to hold these men in reserve,\" I told him, \"until I know\nwhere they'll do most good.  You know this country?  Take high ground,\nthen, where we can overlook what's going on and get into the fight\nto best advantage.\"\n\n\"But the others will get the credit,\" he began to object.\n\n\"I'll ask Kagig for another interpreter.  Wait here.\"\n\nAt that he yielded the point and explained my orders to the men,\nwho began to obey them willingly enough.  But he went on talking\nto them rapidly as we diverged from the path the others had taken\nand ascended a trail that wild goats would have reveled in, along\nthe right flank of where fighting was likely to take place.  I did\nnot doubt he was establishing notions of his own importance, and\nwith some success.\n\nFiring commenced away in front and below us within ten minutes of\nthe start, but it was an hour before I could command the scene with\nfield-glasses, and ten minutes after that before I could make out\nthe positions of our people, although the enemy were soon evident--a\nlong, irregular, ragged-looking line of cavalry thrusting lances\ninto every hole that could possibly conceal an Armenian, and an almost\nequally irregular line of unmounted men in front of them, firing\nnot very cautiously nor accurately from under random cover.\n\nIt became pretty evident, after studying the positions for about\nfifteen minutes and sweeping every contour of the ground through\nglasses, that the enemy had no chance whatever of breaking through\nunless they could outflank Kagig's line.  I held such impregnable\nadvantage of height and cover and clear view that the men I had with\nme were ample to prevent the turning of our right wing.  Our left\nflank rested on the brawling Jihun River that wound in and out between\nthe rice fields and the rocky foot-hills.  There lay the weakness\nof our position, and more than once I caught sight of Kagig spurring\nhis horse from cover to cover to place his men.  Once I thought I\nrecognized Fred, too, over near the river-bank;  but of Will or of\nGloria I saw nothing.\n\nIt was obvious that if reserves were needed anywhere it would be\nover on that left flank by the fordable Jihun.  Ephraim saw that,\nand proceeded to preach it like gospel to the men before consulting\nme.  Then, arrogant in the consciousness of majority approval, he\ncame and advised me.\n\n\"Those--ah--hamidieh not coming this--ah--way.  We cross over\nto--ah--other side.  Then Kagig is being pleased with us.  I give\norders--yes?\"\n\nHe did not propose to wait for my consent, but I detained him with\na hand on his shoulder.  It would have taken us two hours to get\ninto position by the river-bank.\n\n\"Find out how many of the men can ride,\" I ordered.\n\nTaken by surprise he called out the inquiry without stopping to discover\nmy purpose first.  It transpired there were seventeen men who had\nbeen accustomed to horseback riding since their youth.  That would\nleave nine men for another purpose.  I separated sheep from goats,\nand made over the nine to Ephraim.\n\n\"You and these nine stay here,\" I ordered, \"and hold this flank until\nKagig makes a move.\" I did not doubt Kagig would fall back on Zeitoon\nas soon as he could do that with advantage.  Neither did I doubt\nEphraim's ability to spoil my whole plan if he should see fit.  Yet\nI had to depend on his powers as interpreter.\n\nThere are two ways of relieving a weak wing, and the obvious one\nof reenforcing it is not of necessity the best.  I could see through\nthe glasses a bowl of hollow grazing ground in which the dismounted\nKurds had left their horses;  and I could count only five men guarding\nthem.  Most of the horses seemed to be tied head to head by the reins,\nbut some were hobbled and grazing close together.\n\n\"Tell these seventeen men I have chosen that I propose to creep up\nto the enemy's horses and steal or else stampede them,\" I ordered.\n\nEphraim hesitated.  Glittering eyes betrayed fear to be left out\nof an adventure, disgust to see his own advice ignored, and yet that\nhe was alert to the advantage of being left with a lone command.\n\n\"But we should--ah--cross to the--ah--other side and--ah--help Kagig,\"\nhe objected.  Perhaps he hoped to build political influence on the\nbasis of his own account to Kagig afterward of how he had argued\nfor the saner course.\n\n\"Please explain what I have said--exactly!\"\n\nHe continued to hesitate.  I could see the Kurdish riflemen responding\nto orders from their rear and beginning to concentrate in the direction\nof our left wing.  Our center, where Gloria and Will were probably\nconcealed by rocks and foliage, poured a galling fire on them, and\nthey had to reform, and detach a considerable company to deal with\nthat;  but two-thirds of their number surged toward our left, and\nif my plan was to succeed almost the chief element was time.\n\n\"But Kagig will--\"\n\nOne of the men had a hide rope, very likely looted from the village\nwe had burned.  I took it from him and tied a running noose in the\nend.  Then I made the other end fast to the roots of a tree that\nhad been rain-washed until they projected naked over fifty feet of\nsheer rock.\n\n\"Now,\" I said, \"explain what I said, or I'll hang you in sight of\nboth sides!\"\n\nI wondered whether he would not turn the tables and hang me.  I knew\nI would not have been willing to lessen Kagig's chances by shooting\nany of them if they had decided to take Ephraim's part.  But the\npolitician in the man was uppermost and he did not force the issue.\n\n\"All right, effendi--oh, all right!\" he answered, trying to laugh\nthe matter off.\n\n\"Explain to them, then!\"\n\nI made him do it half a dozen times, for once we were on our way\nalong the precipitous sides of the hills the only control I should\nhave would be force of example, aided to some extent by the sort\nof primitive signals that pass muster even in a kindergarten.\nIf they should talk Turkish to me slowly I might understand a little\nhere and there, but to speak it myself was quite another matter;\nand in common with most of their countrymen, though they understood\nTurkish perfectly and all that went with it, they would rather eat\ndirt than foul their months with the language of the hated conqueror.\n\nBut, once explained, the plan was as obvious as the risk entailed,\nand they approved the one as swiftly as they despised the other.\nThe Kurds below were not oblivious to the risk of reprisals from\nthe hills, and we spent five minutes picking out the men posted to\nkeep watch, making careful note of their positions.  At the point\nwhere we decided to debouch on to the plain there were two sentries\ntaking matters fairly easy, and I told off four men to go on ahead\nand attend to those as silently as might be.\n\nThen we started--not close together, for the Kurds would certainly\nbe looking out for an attack from the hills in force, and would not\nbe expecting individuals--but one at a time, two Armenians leading,\nand the rest of them following me at intervals of more than fifty yards.\n\nAt the moment of starting I gave Ephraim another order, and within\ntwo hours owed my life and that of most of my men to his disobedience.\n\n\"You stay here with your handful, and don't budge except as Kagig\nmoves his line!  Few as you are, you can hold this flank safe if\nyou stay firm.\"\n\nHe stayed firm until the last of my seventeen had disappeared around\nthe corner of the cliff;  and five minutes later I caught sight of\nhim through the glasses, leading his following at top speed downward\nalong a spur toward the plain.  The Kurds on the lookout saw him\ntoo and, concentrating their attention on him, did not notice us\nwhen we dodged at long intervals in full sunlight across the face\nof a white rock.\n\nThere was little leading needed;  rather, restraining, and no means\nof doing it.  Instead of keeping the formation in which we started\noff, those in the rear began to overtake the men in front and, rather\nthan disobey the order to keep wide intervals,  to extend down the\nface of the hill, so that within fifteen minutes we were in wide-spaced\nskirmishing order.  Then, instead of keeping along the hills, as\nI had intended, until we were well to the rear of the Kurdish firing-line,\nthey turned half-left too soon, and headed in diagonal bee line toward\nthe horses, those who had begun by leading being last now, and the\nlast men first.  Being shorter-winded than the rest of them and more\ntired to begin with, that arrangement soon left me a long way in\nthe rear, dodging and crawling laboriously and stopping every now\nand then to watch the development of the battle.  There was little\nto see but the flash of rifles;  and they explained nothing more\nthan that the Kurds were forcing their way very close to our center\nand left wing.\n\nNot all the fighting had been done that day under organized leadership.\nI stumbled at one place and fell over the dead bodies of a Kurd and\nan Armenian, locked in a strangle-hold.  That Kurd must have been\nbold enough to go pillaging miles in advance of his friends, for\nthe two had been dead for hours.  But the mutual hatred had not died\noff their faces, and they lay side by side clutching each other's\nthroats as if passion had continued after death.\n\nThe sight of Ephraim and his party hurrying across their front toward\nKagig's weak left wing had evidently convinced the Kurds that no\nmore danger need be expected from their own left.  There can have\nbeen no other possible reason why we were unobserved, for the recklessness\nof my contingent grew as they advanced closer to the horses, and\nfrom the rear I saw them brain one outpost with a rock and rush in\nand knife another with as little regard for concealment as if these\ntwo had been the only Kurds within eagle's view.  Yet they were unseen\nby the enemy, and five minutes later we all gathered in the shelter\nof a semicircle of loose rocks, to regain wind for the final effort.\n\n\"Korkakma!\" I panted, using about ten per cent. of my Turkish vocabulary,\nand they laughed so loud that I cursed them for a bunch of fools.\nBut the man nearest me chose to illustrate his feeling for Turks\nfurther by taking the corner of his jacket between thumb and finger\nand going through the motions of squeezing off an insect--the last,\nmost expressive gesture of contempt.\n\nThe horses were within three hundred yards of us.  On rising ground\nbetween us and the Kurdish firing-line was a little group of Turkish\nofficers, and to our right beyond the horses was miscellaneous baggage\nunder the guard of Kurds, of whom more than half were wounded.  I\ncould see an obviously Greek doctor bandaging a man seated on an\nempty ammunition box.\n\nBut our chief danger was from the mounted scoundrels who were so\nbusy murdering women and children and wounded men half a mile away\nto the rear.  They had come along working the covert like hunters\nof vermin, driving lances into every possible lurking place and no\ndoubt skewering their own wounded on occasion, for which Armenians\nwould afterward be blamed.  We could hear them chorusing with glee\nwhenever a lance found a victim, or when a dozen of them gave chase\nto some panic-stricken woman in wild flight.  Through the glasses\nI could see two Turkish officers with them, in addition to their\nown nondescript \"tin-plate men\";  and if officers or men should get\nsight of us it was easy to imagine what our fate would be.\n\nThat thought, and knowledge that Gloria Vanderman and Will and Fred\nwere engaged in an almost equally desperate venture within a mile\nof me (evidenced by dozens of wild bullets screaming through the\nair) suggested the idea of taking a longer chance than any I had\nthought of yet.  A moment's consideration brought conviction that\nthe effort would be worth the risk.  Yet I had no way of communicating\nwith my men!\n\nI pointed to the Turkish officers clustered together watching the\neffort of their firing-line.  From where we lay to the horses would\nbe three hundred yards;  from the horses to those officers would\nbe about two hundred and fifty yards farther at an angle of something\nlike forty degrees.  Counting their orderlies and hangers-on we\noutnumbered that party by two to one;  and \"the fish starts stinking\nfrom the head\" as the proverb says.  With the head gone, the whole\nKurdish firing-line would begin to be useless.\n\nI tried my stammering Turkish, but the men were in no mood to be\npatient with efforts in that loathly tongue.  None of them knew a\nword in English.  I tried French--Italian--smattering Arabic--but\nthey only shook their heads, and began to think nervousness was driving\nme out of hand.  One of them laid a soothing hand on my shoulder,\nand repeated what sounded like a prayer.\n\nTo lose the confidence of one's men under such circumstances at that\nstage of the game was too much.  I grew really rattled, and at random,\nas a desperate man will I stammered off what I wanted to say in the\nforeign tongue that I knew best, regardless of the fact that Armenians\nare not black men, and that there is not even a trace of connection\nbetween their language and anything current in Africa.  Zanzibar\nand Armenia are as far apart as Australia and Japan, with about as\nmuch culture in common.\n\nTo my amazement a man answered in fluent Kiswahili!  He had traded\nfor skins in some barbarous district near the shore of Victoria Nyanza,\nand knew half a dozen Bantu languages.  In a minute after that we\nhad the plan well understood and truly laid;  and, what was better,\nthey had ceased to believe me a victim of nerves--a fact that gave\nme back the nerve that had been perilously close to vanishing.\n\nWe paid no more attention to the firing-line, nor to the mounted\nKurds who were drawing the coverts nearer and nearer to us.  It was\nunderstood that we were to sacrifice ourselves for our friends, and\ndo the utmost damage possible before being overwhelmed.  We shook\nhands solemnly.  Two or three men embraced each other.  The five\nwho by common consent were reckoned the best rifle shots lay down\nside by side with me among the rocks, and the remainder began crawling\nout one by one on their stomachs toward the horses, with instructions\nto take wide open order as quickly as possible, with the idea of\nmaking the Kurds believe our numbers were greater than they really were.\n\nWhen I judged they were half-way toward the horses we six opened\nfire on the Turkish officers.  And every single one of us missed!\nAt the sound of our volley the devoted horse-thieves rose to their\nfeet and rushed on the horse-guards, forgetting to fire on them from\nsheer excitement, and as a matter of fact one of them was shot dead\nby a horse-guard before the rest remembered they had deadly weapons\nof their own.\n\nI remedied the first outrageous error to a slight extent by killing\nthe Turkish colonel's orderly, missing the commander himself by almost\na yard.  My five men all missed with their second shots, and then\nit was too late to pull off the complete coup we had dared to hope\nfor.  The entire staff took cover, and started a veritable hail of\nfire with their repeating pistols, all aimed at us, and aimed as\nwildly as our own shots had been.\n\nMeanwhile the mounted Kurds at the rear had heard the firing and\nwere coming on full pelt, yelling like red Indians.  I could see,\nin the moment I snatched for a hurried glance in that direction,\nthat the purpose of cutting loose and stampeding the horses was being\naccomplished;  but even that comparatively simple task required time,\nand as the Kurds galloped nearer, the horses grew as nervous as the\nmen who sought to loose them.\n\nBut conjecture and all caution were useless to us six bent on attacking\nthe colonel and his staff.  We crawled out of cover and advanced,\nstopping to fire one or two shots and then scrambling closer, giving\naway our own paucity of numbers, but increasing the chance of doing\ndamage with each yard gained.  And our recklessness had the additional\nadvantage of making the staff reckless too.  The colonel kept in\nclose hiding, but the rest of them began dodging from place to place\nin an effort to outflank us from both sides, and I saw four of them\nbowled over within a minute.  Then the remainder lay low again, and\nwe resumed the offensive.\n\nThe next thing I remember was hearing a wild yell as our party seized\na horse apiece and galloped off in front of the oncoming Kurds--straight\ntoward Kagig's firing-line.  That, and the yelling of the horsemen\nin pursuit drew the attention of the riflemen attacking Kagig to\nthe fact that most of their horses were running loose and that there\nwas imminent danger to their own rear.  I only had time to get a\nglimpse of them breaking back, for the Turkish colonel got my range\nand sent a bullet ripping down the length of the back of my shooting\njacket.  That commenced a duel----he against me--each missing as\ndisgracefully as if we were both beginners at the game of life or\ndeath, and I at any rate too absorbed to be aware of anything but\nmy own plight and of oceans of unexplained noise to right and left.\nI knew there were galloping horses, and men yelling;  but knowledge\nthat the Turkish military rifle I was using must be wrongly sighted,\nand that my enemy had no such disadvantage, excluded every other\nthought.\n\nI had used about half the cartridges in my bandolier when a Kurd's\nlance struck me a glancing blow on the back of the head.  His horse\ncollapsed on top of me, as some thundering warrior I did not see\ngave the stupendous finishing stroke to rider and beast at once.\n\nThere followed a period of semi-consciousness filled with enormous\nclamor, and upheavings, and what might have been earthquakes for\nlack of any other reasonable explanation, for I felt myself being\ndragged and shaken to and fro.  Then, as the weight of the fallen\nhorse was rolled aside there surged a tide of blissful relief that\ncarried me over the border of oblivion.\n\nWhen I recovered my senses I was astride of Rustum Khan's mare, with\na leather thong around my shoulders and the Rajput's to keep me from\nfalling.  We were proceeding at an easy walk in front of a squadron\nof ragged-looking irregulars whom I did not recognize, toward the\ncenter of the position Kagig had held.  Kagig's men were no longer\nin hiding, but standing about in groups;  and presently I caught\nsight of Fred and Will and Kagig standing together, but not Gloria\nVanderman.  A cough immediately behind us made me turn my head.\nThe Turkish colonel, who had fought the ridiculously futile duel\nwith me, was coming along at the mare's tail with his hands tied\nbehind him and a noose about his neck made fast to one of the\nsaddle-rings.\n\n\"Much obliged, Rustum Khan!\" I said by way of letting him know I\nwas alive.  \"How did you get here?\"\n\n\"Ha, sahib!  Not going to die, then?  That is good!  I came because\nColonel Lord Montdidier sahib sent me with a squadron of these mountain\nhorsemen--fine horsemen they are--fit by the breath of Allah to draw\nsteel at a Rajput's back!\"\n\n\"He sent you to find me?\"\n\n\"Ha, sahib.  To rescue you alive if that were possible.\"\n\n\"How did he know where I was?\"\n\n\"An Armenian by name of Ephraim came and said you had gone over to\nthe Turks.  Certain men he had with him corroborated, but three of\nhis party kept silence.  My lord sahib answered 'I have hunted, and\ncamped, and fought beside that man--played and starved and feasted\nwith him.  No more than I myself would he go over to Turks.  He must\nhave seen an opportunity to make trouble behind the Turks' backs.\nTake your squadron and go find him, Rustum Khan!' And I, sahib, obeyed\nmy lord bahadur's orders.\"\n\n\"Where is Lord Montdidier now?\"\n\n\"Who knows, sahib.  Wherever the greatest need at the moment is.\"\n\n\"Tell me what has happened.\"\n\n\"You did well, sahib.  The loosing of the horses and the shooting\nbehind their backs put fear into the Kurds.  They ceased pressing\non our left wing.  And I--watching from behind cover on the right\nwing--snatched that moment to outflank them, so that they ran pell-mell.\nThen I saw the mounted Kurds charging up from the rear, and guessed\nat once where you were, sahib.  The Kurds were extended, and my men\nin close order, so I charged and had all the best of it, arriving\nby God's favor in the nick of time for you, sahib.  Then I took this\ncolonel prisoner.  Only once in my life have I seen a greater pile\nthan his of empty cartridge cases beside one man.  That was the pile\nbeside you, sahib!  How many men did you kill, and he kill?  And\nwho buried them?\"\n\n\"Where is Miss Vanderman?\" I asked, turning the subject.\n\n\"God knows!  What do I know of women?  Only I know this:  that there\nis a gipsy woman bred by Satan out of sin itself, who will make things\nhot for any second filly in this string!  Woe and a woman are one!\"\n\nNot caring to listen to the Indian's opinions of the other sex any\nmore than he would have welcomed mine about the ladies of his own\nland, I made out my injuries were worse than was the case, and groaned\na little, and grew silent.\n\nSo we rode without further conversation up to where Fred and Will\nwere standing with Kagig, and as I tumbled off into Fred's arms I\nwas greeted with a chorus of welcome that included Gloria's voice.\n\n\"That's what I call using your bean!\" she laughed, in the slangy\nway she had whenever Will had the chance to corrupt her Boston manners.\n\n\"It feels baked,\" I said.  \"I used it to stop a Kurd's lance with.\nHullo!   What's the matter with you?\"\n\n\"I stopped a bullet with my forearm!\"\n\nShe was sitting in a sort of improvised chair between two dwarfed\ntree-trunks, and if ever I saw a proud young woman that was she.\nShe wore the bloody bandage like a prize diploma.\n\n\"And I've seen your friend Monty, and he's better than the accounts\nof him!\"\n\nI glanced at Will, alert for a sign of jealousy.\n\n\"Monty is the one best bet!\" he said.  And his eyes were generous\nand level, as a man's who tells the whole truth.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Fourteen\n\"Rajput, I shall hang you if you make more trouble!\"\n\n\n\"LO,  THIS IS THE MAN--\"\n                  (Psalm 52)\n\nChoose, ye forefathers of to-morrow, choose!\nThese easy ways there be\nUncluttered by the wrongs each other bears,\nAnd warmly we shall walk who can not see\nHow thin some other fellow's garment wears,\nNor need to notice whose.\n\nChoose, ye stock-owners in to-morrow, choose!\nThe road these others tread\nIs littered deep with jetsam and the bones\nOf their dishonored dead.\nWhat altruism for defeat atones?\nHave ye not much to lose?\n\nChoose, ye inheritors of ages, choose!\nWhat owe ye to the past?\nThe burly men who Magna Charta wrung\nFrom tyranny entrenched would stand aghast\nTo see the ripples from that stone they flung,\nThey, too, had selfish views.\n\nChoose, ye investors in the future, choose!\nYe need pick cautious odds;\nTo-morrow's fruit is seeded down to-day,\nAnd unwise purpose like the unknown gods\nTempts on a wasteful way.\n\"Ware well what guide ye use!\n\nWe went and bivouacked by the brawling Jihun under a roof of thatch,\nwhose walls were represented by more or less upright wooden posts\nand debris;  for Kagig would not permit anything to stand even for\nan hour that Turks could come and fortify.  None of us believed that\nthe repulse of that handful of Kurdish plunderers and the capture\nof a Turkish colonel would be the end of hostilities--rather the\nbeginning.\n\nKagig, when Gloria asked him what he proposed to do with Rustum Khan's\nprisoner, smiled cynically and ordered him searched by two of the\nZeitoonli standing guard.  Rustum Khan was standing just out of low\near-shot absorbed in contemplation of the lie of the country.  I\nnoticed that Fred began to look nervous, but he did not say anything.\nWill was too busy fussing with Gloria's wound, making a new bandage\nfor it and going through the quite unnecessary motions of keeping\nup her spirits, to observe any other phenomena.  An Armenian woman\nnamed Anna, who had attached herself to Gloria because, she said,\nher husband and children had been killed and she might as well serve\nas weep, sat watching the two of them with quiet amusement.\n\nThe Turk offered no further objection than a shrug of his fatalist\nshoulders and a muttered remark about Ermenie and bandits.  Even\nwhen the mountaineers laughed at the chink of stolen money in all\nhis pockets he did not exhibit a trace of shame.  They shook him,\nand pawed him, and poured out gold in little heaps on the ground\n(out of the magnanimity of his official heart he had doubtless left\nall silver coin for his hamidieh to pouch);  but Kagig only had eyes\nfor the papers they pulled out of his inner pocket and tossed away.\nHe pounced on them.\n\n\"Hah!\" he laughed.  \"There!  Did I tell you?  These are his\norders--signed by a governor's secretary--countersigned by the governor\nhimself--to 'set forth with his troops and rescue Armenians in the\nZeitoon district.'  Rescue them!  Have you seen?  Did you observe\nhis noble rescue work?  Here--see the orders for yourselves!  Observe\nhow the Stamboulis propose to prove their innocence after the event!\"\n\nSince they were written in Turkish they were of no conceivable use\nto any one but Fred and Rustum Khan.  Fred glanced over them, and\nshouted to Rustum Khan to come and look.  That was a mistake, for\nit called the Rajput's attention to what had been happening to his\nprisoner.  He came striding toward us with his black beard bristling\nand eyes blazing with anger.\n\n\"Who searched him?\" he demanded.\n\n\"He was searched by my order,\" Kagig answered in the calm level voice\nthat in a man of such spirit was prophetic of explosion.\n\n\"Who gave thee leave to order him searched, Armenian?\"\n\n\"I left you his money,\" Kagig answered with biting scorn, pointing\nto the little heaps of gold coin on the ground.\n\nI had no means of knowing what peaks of friction had already been\nattained between the two, and it was not likely that I should instantly\nchoose sides against the man who within the hour had saved my life\nat peril of his own.  But Will saw matters in another light, and\nFred began humming through his nose.  Will left Gloria and walked\nstraight up to Rustum Khan.  He had managed to shave himself with\ncold Jihun water and some laundry soap, and his clean jaw suggested\nstandards set up and sworn to since ever they gave the name of Yankee\nto men possessed by certain high ideals.\n\n\"Kagig needs no leave from any one to order prisoners searched!\"\nhe said, shaping each word distinctly.\n\nRustum Khan spluttered, and kicked at a heap of coin.\n\n\"Perhaps you have bargained for your share of all loot?  I have heard\nthat in America men--\"\n\n'Rajput!\" said Kagig, looking down on him from slightly higher ground,\n\"I will hang you if you make more trouble!\"\n\nAt that I interfered.  I was not the only one in Rustum Khan's debt;\nit was likely his brilliant effort at the critical moment had saved\nour whole fighting line.  Besides, I saw the Turk grinning to himself\nwith satisfaction at the rift in our good will.\n\n\"Suppose we refer this dispute to Monty,\" I proposed, reasoning that\nif it should ever get as far as Monty, tempers would have died away\nmeanwhile.  Not that Monty could not have handled the problem, tempers\nand all.\n\n\"I refer no points of honor,\" growled the Rajput. \"I have been\ninsulted.\"\n\n\"Rot!\" exclaimed Fred, getting to his feet.  When his usually neat\nbeard has not been trimmed for a day or two he looks more truculent\nthan he really is.  \"I've been listening.  The insolence was on the\nother side.\"\n\n\"Do you deny Kagig's right to question prisoners?\" I asked, thinking\nI saw a way out of the mess.\n\n\"Can I not question him?\" Rustum Khan turned on me with a gesture\nthat made it clear he held me to no friendship on account of\nservice rendered.\n\nHe strode toward his prisoner, with heaven knows what notion in his\nhead, but Fred interposed himself.  The likeliest thing at that moment\nwas a blow by one or the other that would have banished any chance\nof a returning reign of reason.  Rustum Khan turned his back to the\nTurk and thrust out his chest toward Fred as if daring him to strike.\nEven the kites seemed to expect bloodshed and circled nearer.\n\nIt was Gloria who cut the Gordian knot.  It was her unwounded hand,\nnot Fred's, that touched the Rangar's breast.\n\n\"Rustum Khan,\" she said, \"I think better of you than to believe you\nwould take advantage of our ignorance.  You're a soldier.  We are\nonly civilians trying to help a tortured nation.  We know nothing\nof Rajput customs.  Won't you go to Lord Montdidier and tell him\nabout it, and ask him to decide?  We'll all obey Monty, you know.\"\n\nRustum Khan looked down at her bandaged wrist, and then into violet\neyes that were not in the least degree afraid of him but only looking\ndiligently for the honor he so boasted.\n\n\"Who can refuse a beautiful young woman?\" he said, beginning to melt.\nBut he refused to meet her eyes again, or even to acknowledge\nour existence.\n\n\"I give you the prisoner!\"  He made her a motion of arrogant extravagance\nwith his right hand as if performing the act of transfer.  Then he\nturned on his heel with a little simultaneous mock salute, and striding\nto his bay mare, mounted and rode away.\n\nKagig took over the prisoner at once without comment and began to\nquestion him under a tree twenty yards away, paying no attention\nto the riflemen who matched one another, laughing, for the plundered\nmoney. We four went back to the shelter of the thatch roof, for the\nplan was to remain behind with the company of Zeitoonli whom Kagig\nhad placed carefully at vantage points, and give stragglers a chance\nto save themselves before we resumed the journey to Zeitoon.\n\nNaturally enough, Rustum Khan and his fiery unreason was the subject\nwe discussed, and Fred laid law down as to how he should be dealt\nwith whenever the chance should come to bring him to book.  But Rustum\nKhan was a bagatelle compared to what was coming, if we had only\nknown it.  While we talked I saw Gregor Jhaere, the attaman of gipsies,\nride down the track on a brown mule and dismount within ten yards\nof Kagig.  He hobbled his mule, and went and sat close by Kagig and\nthe Turk, engaging in a three-cornered talk with them.  Kagig seemed\nto have expected him, for there was no sign of greeting or surprise.\n\nThere was nothing disturbing about Gregor's arrival on the scene;\nhe was evidently helping Kagig to cross-examine the Turk and check\nup facts.  Within their limits gipsies are about the best spies\nobtainable because of their ability to take advantage of credulity\nand their own immeasurable unbelief in protest or appearances.  It\nwas the individual who followed Gregor at a distance, and dismounted\nfrom a gray stallion quite a long way off in order not to draw attention\nto herself, who made my blood turn cold.  I caught sight of Maga Jhaere\nfirst because the others had their backs toward her.  Then the expression\nof my face brought Fred to his feet.  By that time Magi had vanished\nout of view unaware that any one had seen her, creeping like a\npantheress from rock to rock.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Fred demanded, sitting down again, ill-tempered\nwith himself for being startled.\n\n\"Maga Jhaere!\"\n\n\"How exciting!\" said Gloria.  \"I'm crazy to meet her.\"\n\nBut Will looked less excited and more anxious than I had ever seen\nhim, and we all three laughed.\n\n\"All right!\" he said.  \"I tell you it's no joke.  That woman believes\nshe's got her hooks in.\"\n\nWe tried to go on talking naturally, but lapsed into uncomfortable\nsilence as the minutes dragged by and no Maga put in her appearance.\nFred began humming through his nose again in that ridiculous way\nthat he thinks seems unconcerned, but that makes his best friends\nyearn to smite him hip and thigh.\n\n\"I guess you were mistaken,\" Will said at last, spreading out his\nshoulders with relief at the mere suggestion.  But I was facing the\ndirection of Zeitoon, as he was not, and again the expression of\nmy face betrayed the facts.\n\nThere were two large stones leaning together, with a small triangular\ngap between them, less than thirty feet from where we sat.  In that\ngap I could see a pair of eyes, and nothing else.  They had almost\nexactly the expression of a panther's that is stalking, not its quarry,\nbut its mortal foe.  In spite of having seen Maga approaching, I\nwould have believed them an animal's eyes, only that from experience\nI knew an animal's eyes betray fear and anger without reason, whereas\nthese blazed with the desperate reasoning that holds fear in contempt.\nPanthers can hate, be afraid, sweep fear aside with anger, and plan\npainstakingly for murderous attack;  but it is only behind human\neyes that one may recognize the murder--purpose based on argument.\n\n\"I see her,\" I said.  \"I suspect she's got a pistol, and--\"\n\nI had not known until that moment that the short hair was standing\nup the back of my head, but I felt it go down with a creepy cold\nchill as I spoke.  Then once more it rose.  Knowing she was seen\nand recognized, Maga got to her feet and stood on the larger of the\ntwo stones, looking down on us.  Her hands were on her hips, and\nI could see no weapon, but her lips moved in voiceless imprecation.\n\n\"Are you Maga Jhaere?\" asked Gloria, first of us all to recover some\nmeasure of self-command.\n\nMaga nodded.  She was barefooted, clothed only in bodice and leather\njacket and a rather short ochre-colored skirt that blew in the gaining\nwind and showed the outline of her lithe young figure.  Her long\nblack hair billowed and galloped in the wind behind her.\n\n\"I am Maga Jhaere,\" she said slowly, addressing Gloria.  \"Who\nare you?\"\n\n\"My name is Gloria Vanderman.\"\n\n\"And that man beside you--who is he?\"\n\nGloria did not answer.  Will looked more embarrassed than the devil\ncaught in daylight, and Fred recovered his mental equilibrium\nsufficiently to chuckle.\n\n\"Is he your husband?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then what you want with 'im?\"\n\nNo one said a word.  Only, Fred made a movement with his hand behind\nhim that Maga noticed and spurned with a toss of her chin.\n\n\"You coming to Zeitoon?\"\n\nGloria nodded.  Glancing over toward Kagig I saw that he was aware\nof Maga and was watching her out of the corner of his eye while he\ntalked with Gregor and the Turk.  They were both getting angry with\nthe Turk and using gestures suggestive of impending agony by way\nof emphasis.  The Turk was growing fidgety.\n\nMaga spread her arms out as if she were embracing all the universe\nand called it hers.\n\n\"Then--if you ar-re coming to Zeitoon--you choose first a 'usband.\nThere are--many 'usbands.  Some 'ave lost a wife--some 'ave sick\nwife--some not yet never 'ad no wife.  Plenty Armenians--also two\nother men there--but you let that one--Will--alone!  Choose a\n'usband--marry,'im--then you come to Zeitoon!  If you come without\na 'usband--I will keel you--do you understand?\"\n\n\"Now then, America!\" grinned Fred in a stage aside that Maga could\nhear as clearly as if it had been intended for her.  \"Let's see the\neagle scream for liberty!\"\n\n\"Eagle scream?\" said Maga, almost screaming herself.  \"What you know\nabout eagles?  You ol' fool!  That man Will is thinking you ar-re\n'is frien'.  You ar-re not 'is frien'!  Let 'im come with me, an'\nI will show 'im what ar-re eagles--what is freedom--what is\nknowledge--what is life!  I know.  You ol' fool, you not know!  You\nol' fool, you marry that woman--then you can bring 'er to Zeitoon an'\nshe is safe!  Otherwise--\"\n\nShe reached in the bosom of her blouse and drew out, not the\nmother-o'-pearl-plated pistol that I feared, but a knife with an\neighteen-inch blade of glittering steel.  Instantly Fred covered\nher with his own repeater, but she laughed in his face.\n\n\"You ol' fool, you ar-re afraid to shoot me!\"\n\nIf she meant that Fred would feel squeamish about shooting before\nshe hurled the knife, then she was certainly right.  But she knew\nbetter than to make one preliminary motion.  And Kagig knew better\nthan to permit further pleasantries.  I saw him whisper to Gregor,\nand the gipsy attaman started on hands and knees to creep round behind\nher.  But Maga's eyes were practised like those of all other wild\ncreatures in detecting movement behind her as well as in front.\nShe spat, and gave vent to a final ultimatum.\n\n\"You 'ave 'eard.  I said--you let that man Will Yerr-kees alone!\nAn' don't you dare come to Zeitoon without a 'usband!\"\n\nThen she turned and dodged Gregor, and ran for her gray stallion--mounted\nthe savage brute with a leap from six feet away, and rode like the\nwind toward the gut of the pass that shut off Zeitoon from our view.\nA minute later a shell from a small-bore cannon screamed overhead,\nand burst a hundred yards beyond us on a sheet of rock.\n\n\"Not bad for a ranging shot!\" said Fred, suddenly as self-possessed\nas if the world never held such a thing as an untamed woman.\n\n\"Observe, you sportmen all!\" Kagig exclaimed, getting to his feet.\n\"The Turkish nobility are proceeding to rescue poor Armenians.  Behold,\ntheir charity comes even from the cannon's mouth!  It is time to\ngo now, lest it overtake us!  No cannon can come in sight of Zeitoon.\nFollow me.\"\n\nWith his usual sudden oblivion of everything but the main objective\nKagig mounted and rode away, followed by Gregor in charge of the\nprisoner, and by a squadron or so of mounted Zeitoonli who attempted\nno formation but came cantering as each detachment realized that\ntheir leader was on the move.  We found ourselves last, without an\narmed man between us and the enemy, although without a doubt there\nwere still dozens of fugitive poor wretches who had not had the\ncourage or perhaps the strength to overtake us yet.\n\nKagig had had the forethought to leave comparatively fresh mules\nfor us to ride, and there was not any particular reason for hurry.\nWill went ahead, with Gloria and Anna beside him on one mule--Gloria\nlaughing him out of countenance because of his nervousness on her\naccount, but he insistent on the danger in case of repeated gun-fire.\nFred rode slowly beside me in the rear, for we still hoped to encourage\na few stray fugitives to come out of their hiding holes and follow\nus to safety.\n\nA second cannon shot, not nearly so well aimed as the first had been,\nwent screaming over toward our left and landed without bursting among\nlow bushes.  A third and a fourth followed it, and the last one did\nexplode.  That was plainly too much for some one who had dodged into\nhiding when the second shot fell;  we saw him come rushing out from\ncover like a lunatic, unconscious of direction and only intent on\nshielding the top of his head with his hands.\n\n\"Is the poor devil hurt?\" I said, wondering.  But Fred broke into\na roar of laughter; and he is not a heartless man--merely gifted\nmore than usual with the hunter's eye that recognizes sex and species\nof birds and animals at long range.  I can see farther than Fred\ncan, but at recognizing details swiftly I am a blind bat compared\nto him.\n\n\"The martyred biped!\" he laughed.  \"Peter Measel by the God\nof happenings!\"\n\nWe rode over toward him, and Peter it was, running with his eyes\nshut.  He screamed when we stopped him, and sobbed instead of talking\nwhen we pulled him in between our mules and offered him two stirrup\nleathers to hold.  He seemed to think that standing between the mules\nwould protect him from the artillery fire, and as we were not in\nany hurry we took advantage of that delusion to let him recover a\nmodicum of nerve.\n\nAnd the moment that began to happen he was the same sweet Peter Measel\nwith the same assurance of every other body's wickedness and his\nown divinity, only with something new in his young life to add poignancy.\n\n\"What were you doing there?\" demanded Fred, as we got him to towing\nalong between us at last.\n\n\"I was looking for her.\"\n\n\"For whom?\"\n\n\"For Maga Jhaere.\"\n\nFred allowed his ribs to shake in silent laughter that annoyed the\nmule, and we had to catch Measel all over again because the beast's\ncrude objections filled the martyred biped full of the desire to run.\n\n\"Somebody must save that girl!\" he panted.  \"And who else can do\nit?  Who else is there?\"\n\n\"There's only you!\" Fred agreed, choking down his mirth.\n\n\"I'm glad you agree with me.  At least you have that much blessedness,\nMr. Fred.  D'you know that girl was willing to be a murderess?  Yes!\nShe tried to murder Rustum Khan.  Rustum Khan ought to be hanged,\nfor he is a villain--a black villain!  But she must not have blood\non her hands--no, no!\"\n\n\"Why didn't she murder him?\" demanded Fred.  \"Qualms at the last moment?\"\n\n\"No.  I'm sorry to say no.  She has no God-likeness yet.  But that\nwill come.  She will repent.  I shall see to that.  It was I who\nprevented her, and she all but murdered me!  She would have murdered\nme, but Kagig held her wrist;  and to punish her he gave an order\nthat I should preach to her morning, afternoon, and evening--three\ntimes a day.  So I had my opportunity.  There was a guard of gipsy\nwomen set to see that she obeyed.\"\n\n\"Continue,\" said Fred.  \"What happened?\"\n\n\"She broke away, and came down to see the fighting.\"\n\n\"Why did you follow her?  Weren't you afraid?\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Fred, if you only knew!  Yet I felt impelled to find her.\nI could not trust her out of sight.\"\n\n\"Why not? She seems fairly well able to look after herself.\"\n\n\"Oh, I can not allow wickedness.  I must make it to cease!  It entered\nmy head that she intended to find Kagig!\"\n\n\"Well?  Why not?\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Fred--tell me!  You may know--you perhaps as well as any\none, for you are such an ungodly man!  What are her relations with\nKagig?  Does he--is he--is there wickedness between them?\"\n\n\"Dashed if I know.  She's a gipsy.  He's a fine half-savage.  Why\nshould it concern you?\"\n\n\"Oh, I could not endure it!  It would break my heart to believe it!\"\n\n\"Then why think about it?\"\n\n\"How can I help it?  I love her!  Oh, I love her, Mr. Fred!  I never\nloved a woman in all my life before.  It would break my heart if\nshe were to be betrayed into open sin by Kagig!  Oh, what shall I\ndo?  What shall I do?  I love her!  What shall I do?\"\n\n\"Do?\" said Fred, looking forward in imagination to new worlds of\nhumor, \"why--make love, if you love her!  Make hot love and strong!\"\n\n\"Will you help me, Mr. Fred?\" the biped stammered.  \"You see, she's\nrather wild--a little unconventional--and I've never made love even\nto a sempstress.  Will you help me?\"\n\n\"Certainly!\" Fred chuckled.  \"Certainly.  I'll guarantee to marry\nher to you if you'll dig up the courage.  Have you a ring?\"\n\nPeter Measel produced a near-gold ring with a smirk almost of\nrecklessness, a plain gold ring whose worn appearance called to mind\nthe finger taken from a dead Kurd's cartridge pouch.  It may be that\nMeasel bought it, but neither Fred nor I spoke to him again, for\nhalf an hour.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Fifteen\n\"Scenery to burst the heart!\"\n\n\nTHE  REBEL'S  HYMN\n\nThe seeds that swell within enwrapping mould,\nGray buds that color faintly in the northing sun,\nDeep roots that lengthen after winter's rest,\nThe flutter of year's youth in April's breast\nAs young leaves in the warming hour unfold--\nThese and my heart are one!\n\nGo dam the river-course with carted earth;\nOr bind with iron bands that riven stone\nThat century on century has slept\nUntil into its heart a tendril crept,\nAnd in the quiet majesty of birth\nNew nature broke into her own!\nOr bid the sun stand still!  Or fashion wings\nTo herd the heaven's stars and make them be\nSubservient to will and rule and whim!\nOr rein the winds, and still the ocean's hymn!\nMore surely ye shall manage all these things\nThan chain the Life in me!\n\nGreat mountains shedding the reluctant snow,\nVision of the finish of the thing begun,\nSpirit of the beauty of the torrent's song,\nUnconquerable peal of carillon,\nAnd secrets that in conquest overflow--\nThese and my heart are one!\n\n\nYet another night we were destined to spend on the Zeitoon road,\nfor we had not the heart to leave behind us the stragglers who balked\nfainting in the gut of the pass.  Some were long past the stage where\nanything less than threats could make impression on them, and only\nable to go forward in a dull dream at the best.  But there were numbers\nof both men and women unexpectedly capable of extremes of heroism,\nwho took the burden of misery upon themselves and exhibited high\nspirits based on no evident excuse.  Nothing could overwhelm those,\nnothing discourage them.\n\n\"To Zeitoon!\" somebody shouted, as if that were the very war-cry\nof the saints of God.  Then in a splendid bass voice he began to\nsing a hymn, and some women joined him.  So Fred Oakes fell to his\nold accustomed task, and played them marching accompaniments on his\nconcertina until his fingers ached and even he, the enthusiast, loathed\nthe thing's bray.  In one way and another a little of the pall of\nmisery was lifted.\n\nKagig sent us down bread and yoghourt at nightfall, so that those\nwho had lived thus far did not die of hunger.  Women brought the\nfood on their heads in earthen crocks--splendid, good-looking women\nwith fearless eyes, who bore the heavy loads as easily as their mountain\nmen-folk carried rifles.  They did not stay to gossip, for we had\nno news but the stale old story of murder and plunder;  and their\nnews was short and to the point.\n\n\"Come along to Zeitoon!\" was the burden of it, carried with a singsong\nlaugh.  \"Zeitoon is ready for anything!\"\n\nBefore we had finished eating, each two of them gathered up a poor\nwretch from our helpless crowd and strode away into the mountains\nwith a heavier load than that they brought.\n\n\"Come along to Zeitoon!\" they called back to us.  But even Fred's\nconcertina, and the hymns of the handful who were not yet utterly\nspent, failed to get them moving before dawn.\n\nWe did not spend the night unguarded, although no armed men lay between\nus and the enemy.  We could hear the Kurds shouting now and then,\nand once, when I climbed a high rock, I caught sight of the glow\nof their bivouac fires.  Imagination conjured up the shrieks of tortured\nvictims, for we had all seen enough of late to know what would happen\nto any luckless straggler they might have caught and brought to make\nsport by the fires.  But there was no imagination about the calls\nof Kagig's men, posted above us on invisible dark crags and ledges\nto guard against surprise.  We slept in comfortable consciousness\nthat a sleepless watch was being kept--until fleas came out of the\nground by battalions, divisions and army corps, making rest impossible.\n\nBut even the flea season was a matter of indifference to the hapless\nfolk who lay around us, and although we fussed and railed we could\nnot persuade them to go forward before dawn broke.  Then, though,\nthey struggled to their feet and started without argument.  But an\nhour after the start we reached the secret of the safety of Zeitoon,\nwithout which not even the valor of its defenders could have withstood\nthe overwhelming numbers of the Turks for all those scores of years;\nand there was new delay.\n\nThe gut of the pass rose toward Zeitoon at a sharp incline--a ramp\nof slippery wet clay, half a mile long, reaching across from buttress\nto buttress of the impregnable hills.  It was more than a ridden\nmule could do to keep its feet on the slope, and we had to dismount.\nIt was almost as much as we ourselves could do to make progress with\nthe aid of sticks, and we knew at last what Kagig had meant by his\nboast that nothing on wheels could approach his mountain home.  The\npoor wretches who had struggled so far with us simply gave up hope\nand sat down, proposing to die there.  The martyred biped copied\nthem, except that they were dry-eyed and he shed tears.  \"To think\nthat I should come to this--that I should come to this!\" he sobbed.\nYet the fool must have come down by that route, and have gone up\nthat way once.\n\nWe should have been in a quandary but for the sound of axes ringing\nin the mountain forest on our left--a dense dark growth of pine and\nother evergreens commencing about a hundred feet above the naked\nrock that formed the northerly side of the gorge.  Where there were\naxes at work there was in all likelihood a road that men could march\nalong, and our refugees sat down to let us do the prospecting.\n\n\"It would puzzle Napoleon to bring cannon over this approach, and\nthe Turks don't breed Napoleons nowadays!\" Fred shouted cheerily.\n\"Give me a hundred good men and I'll hold this pass forever!  Wait\nhere while I scout for a way round.\"\n\nHe tried first along the lower edge of the line of timber, encouraged\nby ringing axes, falling trees, and men shouting in the distance.\n\n\"It looks as if there once had been a road here,\" he shouted down\nto us, \"but nothing less than fire would clear it now, and everything\nis sopping wet.  I never saw such a tangle of roots and rocks.  A\ndog couldn't get thought!\"\n\nWill volunteered to cross to the right-hand side and hunt over there\nfor a practicable path.  Gloria stayed beside me, and I had my first\nopportunity to talk with her alone.  She was very pale from the effects\nof the wound in her wrist, which was painful enough to draw her young\nface and make her eyes burn feverishly.  Even so, one realized that\nas an old woman she would still be beautiful.\n\nI watched the eagles for a minute or two, wondering what to say to\nher, and she did not seem to object to silence, so that I forced\nan opening at last as clumsily as Peter Measel might have done it.\n\n\"What is it about Will that makes all women love him?\"  I asked her.\n\n\"Oh, do they all love him?\"\n\n\"Looks like it!\" said I.\n\nShe still wore the bandolier they had stripped from the man with\nthe bandaged feet, although Will had relieved her of the rifle's\nweight.  To the bottom of the bandolier she had tied the little bag\nof odds and ends without which few western women will venture a mile\nfrom home.  Opening that she produced a small round mirror about\ntwice the size of a dollar piece, and offered it to me with a smile\nthat disarmed the rebuke.\n\n\"Perhaps it's his looks,\" she suggested.\n\nI took the mirror and studied what I saw in it.  In spite of a cracking\nheadache due to that and the gaining sun (for I had lost my hat when\nthe Kurd rode me down with his lance) the episode of Rustum Khan\ncarrying me back out of death's door on his bay mare had not lingered\nin memory.  There had been too much else to think about.  Now for\nthe first time I realized how near that lance-point must have come\nto finishing the chapter for me.  I had washed in the Jihun when\nwe bivouacked, but had not shaved;  later on, my scalp had bled anew,\nso that in addition to unruly hair tousled and matted with dry blood\nI had a week-old beard to help make me look like a graveyard ghoul.\n\n\"I beg pardon!\" I said simply, handing her the mirror back.\n\nAt that she was seized with regret for the unkindness, and utterly\nforgot that I had blundered like a bullock into the sacred sanctuary\nof her newborn relationship to Will.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know which of you is best!\" she said, taking my hand\nwith her unbandaged one.  \"You are great unselfish splendid men.\nWill has told me all about you!  The way you have always stuck to\nyour friend Monty through thick and thin--and the way you are following\nhim now to help these tortured people--oh, I know what you are--Will\nhas told me, and I'm proud--\"\n\nThe embarrassment of being told that sort of thing by a young and\nvery lovely woman, when newly conscious of dirt and blood and\nhalf-inch-long red whiskers, was apparently not sufficient for the\nmirth of the exacting gods of those romantic hills.  There came\ninterruption in the form of a too-familiar voice.\n\n\"Oh, that's all right, you two!  Make the most of it!  Spoon all\nyou want to!  My girl's in the clutches of an outlaw!  Kiss her if\nyou want to--I won't mind!\"\n\nI dropped her hand as if it were hot lead.  As a matter of fact I\nhad hardly been conscious of holding it.\n\n\"Oh, no, don't mind me!\" continued the \"martyred biped\" in a tone\ncombining sarcasm, envy and impudence.\n\n\"Shall I kill him?\" I asked.\n\n\"No! no!\" she said. \"Don't be violent--don't--\"\n\nPeter Measel, whom we had inevitably utterly forgotten, was sitting\nup with his back propped against a stone and his legs stretched straight\nin front of him, enjoying the situation with all the curiosity of\nhis unchastened mind.  I hove a lump of clay at him, but missed,\nand the effort made my headache worse.\n\n\"If you think you can frighten me into silence you're mistaken!\"\nhe sneered, getting up and crawling behind the rock to protect himself.\nBut it needed more than a rock to hide him from the fury that took\nhold of me and sent me in pursuit in spite of Gloria's remonstrance.\n\nViewed as revenge my accomplishment was pitiful, for I had to chase\nthe poor specimen for several minutes, my headache growing worse\nat every stride, and he yelling for mercy like a cur-dog shown the\nwhip, while the Armenians--women and little children as well as\nmen--looked on with mild astonishment and Gloria objected volubly.\nHe took to the clay slope at last in hope that his light weight would\ngive him the advantage;  and there at last I caught him, and clapped\na big gob of clay in his mouth to stop his yelling.\n\nEven viewed as punishment the achievement did not amount to much.\nI kicked him down the clay slope, and he was still blubbering and\npicking dirt out of his teeth when Will shouted that he had found\na foot-track.\n\n\"Do you understand why you've been kicked?\" I demanded.\n\n\"Yes.  You're afraid I'll tell Mr. Yerkes!\"\n\n\"Oh, leave him!\" said Gloria.  \"I'm sorry you touched him.  Let's go!\"\n\n\"It was as much your fault as his, young woman!\" snarled the biped,\ngetting crabwise out of my reach.  \"You'll all be sorry for this before\nI'm through with you!\"\n\nI was sorry already, for I had had experience enough of the world\nto know that decency and manners are not taught to that sort of specimen\nin any other way than by letting him go the length of his disgraceful\ncourse.  Carking self-contempt must be trusted to do the business\nfor him in the end.  Gloria was right in the first instance.  I should\nhave let him alone.\n\nHowever, it was not possible to take his threat seriously, and more\nthan any man I ever met he seemed to possess the knack of falling\nout of mind.  One could forget him more swiftly than the birds forget\na false alarm.  I don't believe any of us thought of him again until\nthat night in Zeitoon.\n\nThe path Will had discovered was hardly a foot wide in places, and\nmules could only work their way along by rubbing hair off their flanks\nagainst the rock wall that rose nearly sheer on the right hand.\nFrom the point of view of an invading army it was no approach at all,\nfor one man with a rifle posted on any of the overhanging crags could\nhave held it against a thousand until relieved.  It was a mystery\nwhy Kagig, or some one else, had not left a man at the foot of the\nclay slope to tell us about this narrow causeway;  but doubtless\nKagig had plenty to think about.\n\nHe and most of his men had gone struggling up the clay slope, as\nwe could tell by the state of the going.  But they were old hands\nat it and knew the trick of the stuff.  We had all our work cut out\nto shepherd our poor stragglers along the track Will found, and even\nthe view of Zeitoon when we turned round the last bend and saw the\nplace jeweled in the morning mist did not do much to increase the speed.\n\nAs Kagig had once promised us, it was \"scenery to burst the heart!\"\nNot even the Himalayas have anything more ruggedly beautiful to show,\nglistening in mauve and gold and opal, and enormous to the eye because\nthe summits all look down from over blowing cloud-banks.\n\nThere were moss-grown lower slopes, and waterfalls plunging down\nwet ledges from the loins of rain-swept majesty;  pine trees looming\nblue through a soft gray fog, and winds whispering to them, weeping\nto them, moving the mist back and forth again;  shadows of clouds\nand eagles lower yet, moving silently on sunny slopes.  And up above\nit all was snow-dazzling, pure white, shading off into the cold blue\nof infinity.\n\nMen clad in goat-skin coats peered down at us from time to time from\ncrags that looked inaccessible, shouting now and then curt recognition\nbefore leaning again on a modern rifle to resume the ancient vigil\nof the mountaineer, which is beyond the understanding of the\nplains-man because it includes attention to all the falling water\nvoices, and the whispering of heights and deeps.\n\nWe came on Zeitoon suddenly, rising out of a gorge that was filled\nwith ice, or else a raging torrent, for six months of the year.\nOver against the place was a mountainside so exactly suggesting painted\nscenery that the senses refused to believe it real, until the roar\nand thunder of the Jihun tumbling among crags dinned into the ears\nthat it was merely wonderful, and not untrue.\n\nThe one approach from the southward--that gorge up which we trudged--was\noverlooked all along its length by a hundred inaccessible\nfastnesses from which it seemed a handful of riflemen could have\ndisputed that right of way forever.  The only other line of access\nthat we could see was by a wooden bridge flung from crag to crag\nthree hundred feet high across the Jihun;  and the bridge was overlooked\nby buildings and rocks from which a hail of lead could have been\nmade to sweep it at short range.\n\nZeitoon itself is a mountain, next neighbor to the Beirut Dagh, not\nas high, nor as inaccessible;  but high enough, and inaccessible\nenough to give further pause to its would-be conquerors.  Not in\nanything resembling even rows, but in lawless disorder from the base\nto the shoulder of the mountain, the stone and wooden houses go piling\nskyward, overlooking one another's roofs, and each with an unobstructed\nview of endless distances.  The picture was made infinitely lovely\nby wisps of blown mist, like hair-lines penciled in the violet air.\n\nDistances were all foreshortened in that atmosphere, and it was\nmid-afternoon before we came to a halt at last face to face with\nblank wall.  The track seemed to have been blocked by half the mountain\nsitting down across it.  We sat down to rest in the shadow of the\nshoulder of an overhanging rock, and after half an hour some one\nlooked down on us, and whistled shrilly.  Kagig with a rifle across\nhis knees looked down from a height of a hundred and fifty feet,\nand laughed like a man who sees the bitter humor of the end of shams.\n\n\"Welcome!\" he shouted between his hands.  And his voice came echoing\ndown at us from wall to wall of the gorge.  Five minutes later he\nsent a man to lead us around by a hidden track that led upward,\nsometimes through other houses, and very often over roofs, across\nridiculously tiny yards, and in between walls so closely set together\nthat a mule could only squeeze through by main force.\n\nWe stabled the mules in a shed the man showed us, and after that\nKagig received us four, and Anna, Gloria's self-constituted maid,\nin his own house.  It was bare of nearly everything but sheer\nnecessities, and he made no apology, for he had good taste, and\nperfect manners if you allowed for the grim necessity of being curt\nand the strain of long responsibility.\n\nA small bench took the place of a table in the main large room.\nThere was a fireplace with a wide stone chimney at one end, and some\nstools, and also folded skins intended to be sat on, and shiny places\non the wall where men in goat-skin coats had leaned their backs.\n\nTwo or three of the gipsy women were hanging about outside, and one\nof the gipsies who had been with him in the room in the khan at Tarsus\nappeared to be filling the position of servitor.  He brought us yoghourt\nin earthenware bowls--extremely cool and good it was;  and after\nwe had done I saw him carry down a huge mess more of it to the house\nbelow us, where many of the stragglers we had brought along were\nquartered by Kagig's order.\n\n\"Where's Monty?\" Fred demanded as soon as we entered the room.\n\n\"Presently!\" Kagig answered--rather irritably I thought.  He seemed\nto have adopted Monty as his own blood brother, and to resent all\nother claims on him.\n\nThe afternoon was short, for the shadow of the surrounding mountains\nshut us in.  Somebody lighted a fire in the great open chimney-place,\nand as we sat around that to revel in the warmth that rests tired\nlimbs better than sleep itself, Kagig strode out to attend to a million\nthings--as the expression of his face testified.\n\nThen in came Maga, through a window, with self-betrayal in manner\nand look of having been watching us ever since we entered.  She went\nup to Will, who was squatted on folded skins by the chimney corner,\nand stood beside him, claiming him without a word.  Her black hair\nhung down to her waist, and her bare feet, not cut or bruised like\nmost of those that walk the hills unshod, shone golden in the firelight.\nI looked about for Peter Measel, expecting a scene, but he had taken\nhimself off, perhaps in search of her.\n\nShe had eyes for nobody but Gloria, and no smile for any one.  Gloria\nstared back at her, fascinated.\n\n\"You married?\" she asked;  and Gloria shook her head.  \"You 'eard\nme, what I said back below there!\"\n\nGloria nodded.\n\n\"You sing?\"\n\n\"Sometimes.\"\n\n\"You dance?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.  I love it.\"\n\n\"Ah!  You shall sing--you shall dance--against me!  First you sing--then\nI sing.  Then you dance--then I dance--to-night--you understan'?\nIf I sing better as you sing--an' if I dance better as you dance--then\nI throw you over Zeitoon bridge, an' no one interfere!  But if you\nsing better as I sing--an' if you dance better as I dance--then you\nshall make a servant of me;  for I know you will be too big fool\nan' too chicken 'earted to keel me, as I would keel you!  You understan'?\"\n\nIt rather looked as if an issue would have to be forced there and\nthen, but at that minute Gregor entered, and drove her out with an\noath and terrific gesture, she not seeming particularly afraid of\nhim, but willing to wait for the better chance she foresaw was coming.\nGregor made no explanation or apology, but fastened down the leather\nwindow-curtain after her and threw more wood on the fire.\n\nThen back came Kagig.\n\n\"Where the devil's Monty?\" Fred demanded.\n\n\"Come!\" was the only answer.  And we all got up and followed him\nout into the chill night air, and down over three roofs to a long\nshed in which lights were burning.  All the houses--on every side\nof us were ahum with life, and small wonder, for Zeitoon was harboring\nthe refugees from all the district between there and Tarsus, to say\nnothing of fighting men who came in from the hills behind to lend\na hand.  But we were bent on seeing Monty at last, and had no patience\nfor other matters.\n\nHowever, it was only the prisoners he had led us out to see, and\nnothing more.\n\n\"Look, see!\" he said, opening the heavy wooden door of the shed as\nan armed sentry made way for him.  (Those armed men of Zeitoon did\nnot salute one another, but preserved a stoic attitude that included\nrecognition of the other fellow's right to independence, too.)  \"Look\nin there, and see, and tell me--do the Turks treat Armenian prisoners\nthat way?\"\n\nWe entered, and walked down the length of the dim interior, passing\nbetween dozens of prisoners lying comfortably enough on skins and\nblankets.  As far as one could judge, they had been fed well, and\nthey did not wear the look of neglect or ill-treatment.  At the end,\nin a little pen all by himself, was the colonel whom Rustum Khan\nhad made a present of to Gloria.\n\n\"What's the straw for?\" Fred demanded.\n\n\"Ask him!\" said Kagig.  \"He understands!  If there should be treachery\nthe straw will be set alight, and he shall know how pigs feel when\nthey are roasted alive!  Never fear--there will be no treachery!\"\n\nWe followed him back to his own house, he urging us to make good\nnote of the prisoners' condition, and to bear witness before the\nworld to it afterward.\n\n\"The world does not know the difference between Armenians and  Turks!\"\nhe complained again and again.\n\nOnce again we arranged ourselves about his open chimney-place, this\ntime with Kagig on a foot-stool in the midst of us.  Heat, weariness,\nand process of digestion were combining to make us drowsily comfortable,\nand I, for one, would have fallen asleep where I sat.  But at last\nthe long-awaited happened, and in came Monty striding like a Norman,\ndripping with dew, and clean from washing in the icy water of some\nmountain torrent.\n\n\"Oh, hello, Didums!\" Fred remarked, as if they had parted about an\nhour ago.  \"You long-legged rascal, you look as if you'd been having\nthe time of your life!\"\n\n\"I have!\" said Monty.  And after a short swift stare at him Fred\nlooked glum.  Those two men understood each other as the clapper\nunderstands the bell.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Sixteen\n\"What care I for my belly, sahib, if you break my heart?\"\n\n\n\"IT WAS VERY GOOD\"\n            (Genesis 1:31)\n\nI saw these shambles in my youth, and said\nThere is no God!  No Pitiful presides\nOver such obsequies as these.  The end\nAlike is darkness whether foe or friend,\nBeast, man or flower the event abides.\nThere is no heaven for the hopeful dead--\nNo better haven than forgetful sod\nThat smothers limbs and mouth and ears and eyes,\nAnd with those, love and permanence and strife\nAnd vanity and laughter that they thought was life,\nMaking mere compost of the one who dies.\nTo whose advantage?  Nay, there is no God!\nBut He, whose other name is Pitiful, was pleased\nBy melting gentleness whose measures broke\nThe ramps of ignorance and keeps of lust,\nTumbling alike folly and the fool to dust,\nTo teach me womanhood until there spoke\nStill voices inspiration had released,\nAnd I heard truly.  All the voices said:\nOut of departed yesterday is grown to-day;\nOut of to-day to-morrow surely breaks;\nOut of corruption the inspired awakes;\nOut of existence earth-clouds roll away\nAnd leave all living, for there are no dead!\n\n\nAfter we had made room for Monty before the fire and some one had\nhung his wet jacket up to dry, we volleyed questions at him faster\nthan he could answer.  He sat still and let us finish, with fingers\nlocked together over his crossed knee and, underneath the inevitable\ngood humor, a rather puzzled air of wishing above all things to\nunderstand our point of view.  Over and over again I have noticed\nthat trait, although he always tried to cover it under an air of\npolite indifference and easy tolerance that was as opaque to a careful\nobserver as Fred's attempts at cynicism.\n\nIn the end he answered the last question first.\n\n\"My agreement with Kagig?\"\n\n\"Yes, tell them!\" put in Kagig.  \"If I should, they would say I lied!\"\n\n\"It's nothing to speak of,\" said Monty offhandedly.  \"It dawned on\nour friend here that I have had experience in some of the arts of\nwar.  I proposed to him that if he would take a force and go to find\nyou, I would help him to the limit without further condition.\nThat's all.\"\n\n\"All, you ass?  Didums, I warned you at the time when you let them\nmake you privy councilor that you couldn't ever feel free again to\nkick over traces!  Dammit, man, you can be impeached by parliament!\"\n\n\"Quite so, Fred.  I propose that parliament shall have to do something\nat last about this state of affairs.\"\n\n\"You'll end up in an English jail, and God help you!--social position\ngone--milked of your last pound to foot the lawyers' bills--otherwise\nthey'll hang you!\"\n\n\"Let 'em hang me after I'm caught!  I've promised.  Remember what\nByron did for Greece?  I don't suppose his actual fighting amounted\nto very much, but he brought the case of Greece to the attention\nof the public.  Public opinion did the rest, badly, I admit, but\nbetter badly and late than never.  I'm in this scrimmage, Fred, until\nthe last bell rings and they hoist my number.\"\n\n\"Fine!\" exclaimed Gloria, jumping to her feet.  \"So am I in it to\na finish!\"\n\nMonty smiled at her with understanding and approval.\n\n\"Almost my first duty, Miss Vanderman,\" he said kindly, \"will be\nto arrange that you can not possibly come to harm or be prejudiced\nby any course the rest of us may decide on.\"\n\n\"Quite so!\" Will agreed with a grin, and Fred began chuckling like\na schoolboy at a show.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" she answered hotly.  \"I've come to harm already--see,\nI'm wounded--I've been fighting--I'm already prejudiced as you call\nit!  If you're an outlaw, so am I!\"\n\nShe flourished her bandaged wrist and looked like Joan of Arc about\nto summon men to sacrifice.  But the argument ready on her lips was\nchecked suddenly.  The night was without wind, yet the outer door\nburst open exactly as if a sudden hurricane had struck it, and Maga\nentered with a lantern in her hand.  She tried to kick the door shut\nagain, but it closed on Peter Measel who had followed breathlessly,\nand she turned and banged his head with the bottom of the lantern\nuntil the glass shattered to pieces.\n\n\"That fool!\" she shouted.  \"Oh, that fool!\"  Then she let him come\nin and close the door, giving him the broken lantern to hold, which\nhe did very meekly, rubbing the crown of his head with the other\nhand;  and she stood facing the lot of us with hands on her hips\nand a fine air of despising every one of us.  But I noticed that\nshe kept a cautious eye on Kagig, who in return paid very little\nattention to her.\n\n\"Fight?\" she exclaimed, pointing at Gloria.  \"What does she know\nabout fighting?  If she can fight,--let her fight me!  I stand ready--I\nwait for 'er!  Give 'er a knife, an' I will fight 'er with my\nbare 'ands!\"\n\nGloria turned pale and Will laid a hand on her shoulder, whispering\nsomething that brought the color back again.\n\n\"Maga!\"\n\nKagig said that one word in a level voice, but the effect was greater\nthan if he had pointed a pistol.  The fire died from her eyes and\nshe nodded at him simply.  Then her eyes blazed again, although she\nlooked away from Gloria toward a window.  The leather blind was tied\ndown at the corners by strips of twisted hide.\n\nShe began to jabber in the gipsy tongue--then changed her mind and\nspat it out in English for our joint benefit.\n\n\"All right.  She is nothing to do with me, that woman, and she shall\ncome to a rotten end, I know, an' that is enough.  But there is some\none listening!  Not a woman--not with spunk enough to be a woman!\nThat dirty horse-pond drinking unshaven black bastard Rustum Khan\nis outside listening!  You think 'e is busy at the fortifying?  Then\nI tell you, No, 'e is not!  'E is outside listening!\"\n\nThe surprising answer to that assertion was a heavy saber thrust\nbetween the window-frame and blind and descending on the thong. Next\nfollowed Rustum Khan's long boot.  Then came the man himself with\ndew all over his upbrushed beard, returning the saber to its scabbard\nwith an accompanying apologetic motion of the head.\n\n\"Aye, I was listening!\"  He spoke as one unashamed.  \"Umm Kulsum\"\n(that was his fancy name for Maga) \"spoke truth for once!  I came\nfrom the fortifying, where all is finished that can be done to-night.\nI have been the rounds.  I have inspected everything.  I report all\nwell.  On my way hither I saw Umm Kulsum, with that jackal trotting\nat her heel--he made a scornful gesture in the direction of Peter\nMeasel, who winced perceptibly, at which Fred Oakes chuckled and\nnudged me--\"and I followed Umm Kulsum, to observe what harm she might\nintend.\"\n\n\"Black pig!\" remarked Maga, but Rustum Khan merely turned his splendid\nback a trifle more toward her.  His color, allowing for the black beard,\nwas hardly darker than hers.\n\n\"Why should I not listen, since my heart is in the matter?  Lord\nsahib--Colonel sahib bahadur!--take back those words before it is\ntoo late!  Undo the promise made to this Armenian!  What is he to\nthee?  Set me instead of thee, sahib!  What am I?  I have no wives,\nno lands any longer since the money-lenders closed their clutches\non my eldest son, no hope, nor any fellowship with kings to lose!\nBut I can fight, as thou knowest!  Give me, sahib, to redeem thy\npromise, and go thou home to England!\"\n\n\"Sit down, Rustum Khan!\"\n\n\"But, sahib--\"\n\n\"Sit down!\" Monty repeated.\n\n\"I will not see thee sacrificed for this tribe of ragged people,\nColonel sahib!\"\n\nMonty rose to his feet slowly.  His face was an enigma.  The Rajput\nstood at attention facing him and they met each other's eyes--East\nfacing West--in such fashion that manhood seemed to fill the smoky\nroom.  Every one was silent.  Even Maga held her breath.  Monty strode\ntoward Rustum Khan; the Rajput was the first to speak.\n\n\"Colonel sahib, I spoke wise words!\"\n\nIt seemed to me that Monty looked very keenly at him before he answered.\n\n\"Have you had supper, Rustum Khan?  You look to me feverish from\noverwork and lack of food.\"\n\n\"What care I for my belly, sahib, if you break my heart?\" the Rajput\nanswered.  \"Shall I live to see Turks fling thy carcass to the birds?\nI have offered my own body in place of thine.  Am I without honor,\nthat my offer is refused?\"\n\nMonty answered that in the Rajput tongue, and it sounded like the\nbass notes of an organ.\n\n\"Brother mine, it is not the custom of my race to send substitutes\nto keep such promises.  That thou knowest, and none has reason to\nknow better.  If thy memories and honor urge thee to come the way\nI take, is there no room for two of us?\"\n\n\"Aye, sahib!\" said the Rajput huskily.  \"I said before, I am thy\nman.  I come.  I obey!\"\n\n\"Obey, do you?\" Monty laid both hands on the Rajput's shoulders,\nstruck him knee against knee without warning and pressed him down\ninto a squatting posture.  \"Then obey when I order you to sit!\"\n\nThe Rajput laughed up at him as suddenly sweet-tempered as a child.\n\n\"None other could have done that and not fought me for it!\" he said\nsimply.  \"None other would have had the strength!\" he added.\n\nMonty ignored the pleasantry and turned to Maga, so surprising that\nyoung woman--that she gasped.\n\n\"Bring him food at once, please!\"\n\n\"Me?  I?  I bring him food?  I feed that black--\"\n\n\"Yes!\" snapped Kagig suddenly.  \"You, Maga!\"\n\nMaga's and Kagig's eyes met, and again he had his way with her instantly.\nPeter Measel, standing over by the door, looked wistful and\nsighed noisily.\n\n\"Why should you obey him?\" he demanded, but Maga ignored him as she\npassed out, and Fred nudged me again.\n\n\"A miracle!\" he whispered.  \"Did you hear the martyred biped suggest\nrebellion to her?  He'll be offering to fight Kagig next!  Guess\nwhat is Kagig's hold over the girl--can you?\"\n\nBut a much greater miracle followed.  Rather than disobey Monty again;\nrather than seem to question his authority, or differ from his judgment\nin the least, Rustum Khan forebore presently from sending for his\nown stripling servant and actually accepted food from Maga's hands.\n\nAs a Mahammadan, he made in theory no caste distinctions.  But as\na Rajput be had fixed Hindu notions without knowing it, and almost\nhis chief care was lest his food should be defiled by the touch of\noutcasts, of whom he reckoned gipsies lowest, vilest and least\ncleansible.  Nevertheless he accepted curds that had been touched\nby gipsy fingers, and ate greedily, in confirmation of Monty's diagnosis;\nand after a few minutes he laid his head on a folded goat-skin in\nthe corner, and fell asleep.\n\nThen Monty sent a servant to his own quarters for some prized possession\nthat he mentioned in a whisper behind his hand.  None of us suspected\nwhat it might be until the man returned presently with a quart bottle\nof Scotch whisky.  Kagig himself got mugs down from a shelf three\ninches wide, and Monty poured libations.  Kagig, standing with legs\napart, drank his share of the strong stuff without waiting;  and\nthat brought out the chief surprise of the evening.\n\n\"Ah-h-h!\" he exclaimed, using the back of his hand to wipe mobile\nlips. \"Not since I drank in Tony's have I tasted that stuff!  The\ntaste makes me homesick for what never was my home, nor ever can be!\nTony's--ah!\"\n\n\"What Tony's?\" demanded Will, emerging from whispered interludes\nwith Gloria like a man coming out of a dream.\n\n\"Tony's down near the Battery.\"\n\n\"What--the Battery, New York--?\"\n\n\"Where else?  Tony was a friend of mine.  Tony lent me money when\nI landed in the States without a coin.  It was right that I should\ntake a last drink with Tony before I came away forever.\"\n\nFred reached into the corner for a lump of wood and set it down\nsuggestively before the fire.  Kagig accepted and sat down on it,\nstretching his legs out rather wearily.\n\n\"I noticed you've been remembering your English much better than\nat first,\" said Will.  \"Go on, man, tell us!\"\n\nKagig cleared his throat and warmed himself while his eyes seemed\nto search the flames for stories from a half-forgotten past.\n\n\"Weren't the States good enough for you?\" Will suggested, by way\nof starting him off.\n\n\"Good enough?  Ah!\"  He made all eight fingers crack like castanets.\n\"Much too good!  How could I live there safe and comfortable--eggs\nand bacon--clean shirt--good shoes--an apartment with a bath in it--easy\nwork--good pay--books to read--kindness--freedom--how could\nI accept all that, remembering my people in Armenia?\"\n\nHe ran his fingers through his hair, and stared in the fire\nagain--remembering America perhaps.\n\n\"There was a time when I forgot.  All young men forget for a while\nif you feed them well enough.  The sensation of having money in my\npocket and the right to spend it made me drunk.  I forgot Armenia.\nI took out what are called first papers.  I was very prosperous--very\ngrateful.\"\n\nHe lapsed into silence again, holding his head bowed between his\nhands.\n\n\"Why didn't you become a citizen?\" asked Will.\n\n\"Ah!  Many a time I thought of it.  I am citizen of no land--of no\nland!  I am outlaw here--outlaw in the States!  I slew a Turk.  They\nwould electrocute me in New York--for slaying the man who--have you\nheard me tell what happened to my mother, before my very eyes?\nWell--that man came to America, and I slew him!\"\n\n\"Why did you leave Armenia in the first place?\" asked Gloria, for\nhe seemed to need pricking along to prevent him from getting off\nthe track into a maze of silent memory.\n\n\"Why not?  I was lucky to get away!  That cursed Abdul Hamid had\nbeen rebuked by the powers of Europe for butchering Bulgars, so he\nturned on us Armenians in order to prove to himself that he could\ndo as he pleased in his own house.  I tell you, murder and rape in\nthose days were as common as flies at midsummer!  I escaped, and\nworked my passage in the stoke-hole of a little merchant steamer--they\nwere little ships in those days.  And when I reached America\nwithout money or friends they let me land because I had been told\nby the other sailors to say I was fleeing from religious persecution.\nThe very first day I found a friend in Tony.  I cleaned his windows,\nand the bar, and the spittoons;  and he lent me money to go where\nwork would be plentiful.  Those were the days when I forgot Armenia.\"\n\nHe began to forget our existence again, laying his face on his forearms\nand staring down at the floor between his feet.\n\n\"What brought it back to memory?\" asked Gloria.\n\n\"The Turk brought it back--Fiamil--who bought my mother from four\ndrunken soldiers, and ill-treated her before my eyes.  He came to\nthe Turkish consulate, not as consul but in some peculiar position;\nand by that time I was thriving as head-waiter and part-owner of\na New York restaurant.  Thither the fat beast came to eat daily.\nAnd so I met him, and recognized him.  He did not know me.\n\n\"Remember, I was young, and prosperous for the first time in all\nmy life.  You must not judge me by too up-right standards.  At first\nI argued with myself to let him alone.  He was nothing to me.  I\nno longer believed in God.  My mother was long dead, and Armenia\nno more my country.  My money was accumulating in a savings bank.\nI was proud of it, and I remember I saw visions of great restaurants\nin every city of America, all owned by me!  I did not like to take\nany step that should prevent that flow of money into the savings bank.\n\n\"But Fiamil inflamed my memory, and I saw him every day.  And at\nlast it dawned on me what his peculiar business in America must be.\nHe was back at his old games, buying women.  He was buying American\nyoung women to be shipped to Turkey, all under the seal of consular\nactivity.  One day, after he had had lunch and I had brought him\ncigarettes and coffee, he made a proposal.  And although I did not\ncare very deeply for the women of a free land who were willing to\nbe sold into Turkish harems, nevertheless, as I said, he inflamed\nmy memory.  A love of Armenia returned to me.  I remembered my people,\nI remembered my mother's shame, and my own shame.\n\n\"After a little reflection I agreed with Fiamil, and met him that\nnight in an up-stairs room at a place he frequented for his purposes.\nI locked the door, and we had some talk in there, until in the end\nhe remembered me and all the details of my mother's death.  After\nthat I killed him with a corkscrew and my ten fingers, there being\nno other weapon.  And I threw his body out of the window into the\ngutter, as my mother's body had been thrown, myself escaping from\nthe building by another way.\n\n\"Not knowing where to hide, I kept going--kept going;  and after\ntwo days I fell among sportmen--cow-punchers they called themselves,\nwho had come to New York with a circus, and the circus had gone broke.\nTo them I told some of my story, and they befriended me, taking me\nWest with them to cook their meals;  and for a year I traveled in\ncow camps.  In those days I remembered God as well as Armenia, and\nI used to pray by starlight.\n\n\"And Armenia kept calling--calling.  Fiamil had wakened in me too\nmany old memories.  But there was the money in the savings bank that\nI did not dare to draw for fear the police might learn my address,\nyet I had not the heart to leave behind.\n\n\"So I took a sportman into my confidence, and told him about my money,\nand why I wanted it.  He was not the foreman, but the man who took\nthe place of foreman when the real foreman was too drunk--the hungriest\nman of all, and so oftenest near the cook-fire.  When I had told him,\nhe took me to a township where a lawyer was, and the lawyer drew\nup a document, which I signed.\n\n\"Then the sportman--his name was Larry Atkins, I remember--took that\ndocument and went to draw the money on my behalf.  And that was the\nlast I saw of him.  Not that he was not sportman--all through.  He\ntold me in a letter afterward that the police arrested him, supposing\nhim to be me, but that he easily proved he was not me, and so got\naway with the money.  Enclosed in the package in which the letter\ncame were his diamond ring and a watch and chain, and he also sent\nme an order to deliver to me his horse and saddle.\n\n\"He explained he had tried to double my money by gambling, but had\nlost.  Therefore he now sent me all he had left, a fair exchange\nbeing no robbery.  Oh, he was certainly sportman!\n\n\"So I sold his watch and chain and the horse--but the diamond ring\nI kept--behold it!--see, on Maga's hand!--it was a real diamond that\na woman had given him;  and with the proceeds I came back to Armenia.\nIn Armenia I have ever since remained, with the exception of one\nor two little journeys in time of war, and one or two little temporary\nhidings, and a trip into Persia, and another into Russia to\nget ammunition.\n\n\"How have I lived?  Mostly by robbery!  I rob Turks and all friends\nof Turks, and such people as help make it possible for Turks as a\nnation to continue to exist!  I--we--I and my men--we steal a cartridge\nsooner than a piaster--a rifle sooner than a thousand roubles!  Outlaws\nmust live, and weapons are the chief means!  I am the brains and\nthe Eye of Zeitoon, but I have never been chieftain, and am not now.\nObserve my house--is it not empty?  I tell you, if it had not been\nfor my new friend Monty there would have been six or seven rival\nchieftains in Zeitoon to-night!  As it is, they sulk in their houses,\nthe others, because Monty has rallied all the fighting men to me!\nNow that Monty has come I think there will be unity forever in Zeitoon!\"\n\nHe turned toward Monty with a gesture of really magnificent approval.\nCaesar never declined a crown with greater dignity.\n\n\"You, my brother, have accomplished in a few days what I have failed\nto do in years!  That is because you are sportman!  Just as Larry\nAtkins was sportman!  He sent me all he had, and could not do more.\nI understood him.  Why did he do it?  Simply sportman--that is all!\nWhy do you do this?  Why do you throw your life into the hot cauldron\nof Zeitoon?  Because you are sportman!  And my people see, and\nunderstand.  They understand, as they have never understood me!\nI will tell you why they have never understood me.  This is why:\n\n\"I have always kept a little in reserve.  At one time money in a bank.\nAt another time money buried.  Sometimes a place to run and hide in.\nNow and then a plan for my own safety in case a defense should fail.\nNever have I given absolutely quite all, burning all my bridges.\nHad I been Larry Atkins I would not have gambled with the money of\na man who trusted me;  but, having lost the money, I would not have\nsent my diamond and the watch and chain!  Neither, if the horse and\nsaddle bad been within my reach would I have sent an order to deliver\nthose!  That is why Zeitoon has never altogether trusted me! Some,\nbut never all, until to-night!\n\n\"My brother--\"\n\nHe stood up, with the motions of a man who is stiff with weariness.\n\n\"I salute you!  You have taught me my needed lesson!\"\n\n\"I wonder!\" whispered Fred to me.  \"Remember Peter at the fireside?\nMethinks friend Kagig doth too much protest!  We'll see.  Nemesis\ncomes swiftly as a rule.\"\n\nI shoved Fred off his balance, rolled him over, and sat on him, because\ncynicism and iconoclasm are twin deities I neither worship nor respect.\nBut at times Fred Oakes is gifted with uncanny vision.  While he\nstruggled explosively to throw me off, the door began resounding\nto steady thumps, and at a sign from Kagig, Maga opened it.\n\nThere strode in nine Armenians, followed closely by one of the gipsies\nof Gregor Jhaere's party, who whispered to Maga through lips that\nhardly moved, and made signals to Kagig with a secretive hand like\na snake's head.  I got off Fred's stomach then, and when he had had\nhis revenge by emptying hot pipe ashes down my neck he sat close\nbeside me and translated what followed word for word.  It was all\nin Armenian, spoken in deadly earnest by hairy men on edge with anxiety\nand yet compelled to grudging patience by the presence of strangers\nand knowledge of the hour's necessity.\n\nWhen the gipsy had finished making signals to Kagig be sat down and\nseemed to take no further interest.  But a little later I caught\nsight of him by the dancing fire-light creeping along the wall, and\npresently he lay down with his head very close to Rustum Khan's.\nNothing points more clearly to the clarifying tension of that night\nthan the fact that Rustum Khan with his notions about gipsies could\ncompel himself to lie still with a gipsy's head within three inches\nof his own, and sham sleep while the gipsy whispered to him.  I was\nnot the only one who observed that marvel, although I did not know\nthat at the time.\n\nThe nine Armenians who had entered were evidently influential men.\nElders was the word that occurred as best describing them.  They\nwere smelly with rain and smoke and the close-kept sweat beneath\ntheir leather coats--all of them bearded--nearly all big men--and\nthey strode and stood with the air of being usually heard when they\nchose to voice opinion.  Kagig stood up to meet them, with his back\ntoward the fire--legs astraddle, and hands clasped behind him.\n\n\"Ephraim says,\" began the tallest of the nine, who had entered first\nand stood now nearest to Kagig and the firelight, \"that you will\nyourself be king of Armenia!\"\n\n\"Ephraim lies!\" said Kagig grimly.  \"He always does lie.  That man\ncan not tell truth!\"\n\nTwo of the others grunted, and nudged the first man, who made an\nexclamation of impatience and renewed the attack.\n\n\"But there is the Turk--the colonel whom your Indian friend took\nprisoner--he says--\"\n\n\"Pah!  What Turk tells the truth?\"\n\n\"He says that the Indian--what is his name?  Rustum Khan--was purposing\nto use him as prisoner-of-war, whereas in accordance with a private\nagreement made beforehand you were determined to make matters easy\nfor him.  He demands of us better treatment in fulfilment of promise.\nHe says that the army is coming to take Zeitoon, and to make you\ngovernor in the Sultan's name.  He offered us that argument thinking\nwe are your dupes.  He thought to--\"\n\n\"Dupes?\" snarled Kagig.  \"How long have ye dealt with Turks, and\nhow long with me, that ye take a Turk's word against mine?\"\n\n\"But the Turk thought we are your friends,\" put in a harsh-voiced\nman from the rear of the delegation.  \"Otherwise, how should he have\ntold us such a thing?\"\n\n\"If he had thought you were my friends,\" Kagig answered, \"he would\nnever have dared.  If you had been my friends, you would have taken\nhim and thrown him into Jihun River from the bridge!\"\n\n\"Yet he has said this thing,\" said a man who had not spoken yet.\n\n\"And none has heard you deny it, Kagig!\" added the man nearest the door.\n\n\"Then hear me now!\" Kagig shouted, on tiptoe with anger.  Then he\ncalmed himself and glanced about the room for a glimpse of eyes\nfriendly to himself.  \"Hear me now.  Those Turks--truly come to set\na governor over Zeitoon.  I forgot that the prisoner might understand\nEnglish. I talked with this friend of mine--he made a gesture toward\nMonty.  \"Perhaps that Turk overheard, he is cleverer than he looks.\nI had a plan, and I told it to my friend.  The Turk was near, I\nremember, eating the half of my dinner I gave him.\"\n\n\"Have you then a plan you never told to us?\" the first man asked\nsuspiciously.\n\n\"One plan?  A thousand!  Am I wind that I should babble into heedless\nears each thought that comes to me for testing?  First it was my\nplan to arouse all Armenia, and to overthrow the Turk.  Armenia failed\nme.  Then it was my plan to arouse Zeitoon, and to make a stand here\nto such good purpose that all Armenia would rally to us.  Bear me\nwitness whether Zeitoon trusted me or not?  How much backing have\nI had?  Some, yes;  but yours?\n\n\"So it was plain that if the Turks sent a great army, Zeitoon could\nonly hold out for a little while, because unanimity is lacking.\nAnd my spies report to me that a greater army is on the way than\never yet came to the rape of Armenia.  These handful of hamidieh\nthat ye think are all there is to be faced are but the outflung\nskirmishers.  It was plain to me that Zeitoon can not last.  So I\nmade a new plan, and kept it secret.\"\n\n\"Ah-h-h!  So that was the way you took us into confidence?  Always\nsecrets behind secrets, Kagig!  That is our complaint!\"\n\n\"Listen, ye who would rather suspect than give credit!\"  He used\none word in the Armenian.  \"It was my plan--my new plan, that seeing\nthe Turks insist on giving us a governor, and are able to overwhelm\nus if we refuse, then I would be that governor!\"\n\n\"Ah-h-h!  What did we say!  Unable to be king, you will be governor!\"\n\n\"I talked that over with my new friend, and he did not agree with\nme, but I prevailed.  Now hear my last word on this matter:  I will\nnot be governor of Zeitoon!  I will lead against this army that is\ncoming.  If you men prevent me, or disobey me, or speak against me,\nI will hang you--every one!  I will accept no reward, no office,\nno emolument, no title--nothing!  Either I die here, fighting for\nZeitoon, or I leave Zeitoon when the fighting is over, and leave\nit as I came to it--penniless!  I give now all that I have to give.\nI burn my bridges!  I take inviolable oath that I will not profit!\nAnd by the God who fed me in the wilderness, I name my price for\nthat and take my payment in advance!  I will be obeyed!  Out with\nyou!  Get out of here before I slay you all!  Go and tell Zeitoon\nwho is master here until the fight is lost or won!\"\n\nHe seized a great firebrand and charged at them, beating right and\nleft, and they backed away in front of him, protesting from under\nforearms raised to protect their faces.  He refused to hear a word\nfrom them, and drove, them back against the door.\n\nStrange to say, it was Rustum Khan who gave up all further pretense\nat sleeping and ran round to fling the door open--Rustum Khan who\ntook part with Kagig, and helped drive them out into the dark, and\nRustum Khan who stood astraddle in the doorway, growling after them\nin Persian--the only language he knew thoroughly that they likely\nunderstood:\n\n\"Bismillah!  Ye have heard a man talk!  Now show yourselves men,\nand obey him, or by the beard of God's prophet there shall be war\nwithin Zeitoon fiercer than that without!  Take counsel of your\nwomen-folk!  Ye--\"  (he used no drawing-room word to intimate their\nsex)--\"are too full of thoughts to think!\"\n\nThen he turned on Kagig, and held out a lean brown hand.  Kagig\nclasped it, and they met each other's eyes a moment.\n\n\"Am I sportman?\" Kagig asked ingenuously.\n\n\"Brother,\" said Rustum Khan, \"next after my colonel sahib I accept\nthee as a man fit to fight beside!\"\n\nWe were all standing.  A free-for-all fight had seemed too likely,\nand we had not known whether there were others outside waiting to\nreinforce the delegation.  Rustum Khan sought Monty's eyes.\n\n\"You have the news, sahib?\"\n\nKagig laughed sharply, and dismissed the past hour from his mind\nwith a short sweep of the hand.\n\n\"No.  Tell me,\" said Monty.\n\n\"The gipsy brought it.  A whole division of the Turkish regular army\nis on the march.  Their rear-guard camps to-night a day's march this\nside of Tarsus.  Dawn will find the main body within sight of us.\nHalf a brigade has hurried forward to reenforce the men we have just\nbeaten.  Are there any orders?\"\n\nFred's face fell, and my heart dropped into my boots.  A division\nis a horde of men to stand against.\n\n\"No,\" said Monty.  \"No orders yet.\"\n\n\"Then I will sleep again,\" said Rustum Khan, and suited action to\nthe word, laying his head on the same folded goat-skin he had used\nbefore and breathing deeply within the minute.\n\nNobody spoke.  Rustum Khan's first deep snore had not yet announced\nhis comment on the situation, and we all stood waiting for Kagig\nto say something.  But it was Peter Measel who spoke first.\n\n\"I will pray,\" he announced.  \"I saw that gipsy whispering to the\nIndian, and I know there is treachery intended!  O Lord--O righteous\nLord--forgive these people for their bloody and impudent plans!\nForgive them for plotting to shed blood!  Forgive them for arrogance,\nfor ambition, for taking Thy name in vain, for drinking strong drink,\nfor swearing, for vanity, and for all their other sins.  Forgive\nabove all the young woman of the party, who is not satisfied with\na wound already but looks forward with unwomanly zest to further\nfighting!  Forgive them for boasting and--\"\n\n\"Throw that fool out!\" barked Kagig suddenly.\n\n\"O Lord forgive--\"\n\nFred was nearest the door, and opened it.  Maga laughed aloud.  I\nwas nearest to Peter Measel, so it was I who took him by the neck\nand thrust him into outer darkness.  Kagig kicked the door shut\nafter him;  but even so we heard him for several minutes grinding\nout condemnatory prayers.\n\n\"Now sleep, sportmen all!\" said Kagig, blessing us with both hands.\n\"Sleep against the sport to-morrow!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter Seventeen\n\"I knew what to expect of the women!\"\n\n\n\"AND  DELILAH  SAID--\"\n\nAlways at fault is the fellow betrayed\n(Majorities murder to prove it!)\nAs Samson discovered, Delilah lies,\nThe stigma's stuck on by the cynical wise,\nAnd nothing can ever remove it.\nWe'll cast out Delilah and spit on her dead,\n(That revenge is remarkably human),\nAnd pity the victim of underhand tricks\nSo be that it's moral (the sexes don't mix);\nBut, oh, think what the cynical wise would have said\nIf Judas were only a woman!\n\n\nWe slept until Monty called us, two hours before dawn, although I\nwas conscious most of the night of stealthy men and women who stepped\nover me to get at Kagig and whisper to him.  His marvelous spy system\nwas working full blast, and he seemed to run no risks by letting\nthe spies report to any one but himself.  Fred, who slept more lightly\nthan I did, told me afterward that the women principally brought\nhim particulars of the workings of local politics;  the men detailed\nnews of the oncoming concrete enemy.\n\nThere was breakfast served by Maga in the dark--hot milk, and a\nstrange mess of eggs and meat.  For some reason no one thought of\nrelighting the fire, and although the ashes glowed we shivered until\nthe food put warmth in us.\n\nBy the light of the smoky lamp I thought that Monty wore a strangely\ndivided air, between gloom and exultation.  Fred had been wide awake\nand talking with him since long before first cock-crow and was obviously\nout of sorts, shaking his head at intervals and unwilling more than\nto poke at his food with a fork.  I crossed the room to sit beside\nthem, and came in for the tail end of the conversation.\n\n\"I might have known it, Didums, when I let you go on alone.  I'll\nnever forgive myself.  I had a premonition and disobeyed it.  You\npose as a cast-iron materialist with no more ambition than money\nenough to retrieve your damned estates, and all the while you're\nthe most romantic ass who ever wore out saddle-leather!  Found it,\nhave you?  Then God help us all!  I know what's coming!  You're about\nto 'vert back to Crusader days, and try to do damsilly deeds of\nchivalry without the war-horse or the suit of mail!\"\n\n\"No need for you to join me, Fred.  You take charge of the others\nand get them away to safety.\"\n\n\"Take charge of hornets!  I'd leave you, of course, like a shot!\nBut can you see Will Yerkes, for instance, riding off and leaving\nyou to play Don Quixote?  Damn you, Didums, can't you see--?\"\n\n\"Destiny, Fred. Manifest destiny.\"\n\n\"Can't you see crusading is dead as a dead horse?\"\n\n\"So am I, old man.  I'm no use but to do this very thing.  I can serve\nthese people.  If I'm killed, there'll be a howl in the papers.\nIf I'm taken, there'll be a row in parliament.\"\n\n\"You don't intend to be taken--I know you!\"\n\n\"Honest, Fred, I--\"\n\n\"Have I known you all these years to be fooled now?  Smelling rats\n'ud be subtle to it--I can feel the air bristling!  You mean to raise\nthe Montdidier banner and die under it, last of your race.  But you're\nnot last, you bally ass!\"\n\n\"Last in the direct line, Fred.\"\n\n\"Yes, but there's that rotter Charles ready to inherit!  If you're\nbent on suicide--\"\n\n\"I'm not.  You know I'm not.\"\n\n\"--you might have the decency to kill that miserable cousin first\nand bring the line to an end in common honor!  He'll survive you,\nand as sure as I sit here and swear at you, he'll bring the Montdidier\nname into worse disgrace than Judas Iscariot's!\"\n\n\"I've no intention of suicide, Fred. I assure you--\"\n\nBut Fred waved the argument aside contemptuously, and stood up to\ngather our attention.\n\n\"Listen!\"  He thrust forward his Van Dyke beard that valiantly strove\nto hide a chin like a piece of flint.  \"Monty has found the robbers'\nnest that used to belong to his infernal ancestors.  I charge any\nof you who count yourselves his friends to help me prevent him from\nbehaving like an idiot!\"\n\n\"That'll do, Fred!\" said Monty, pressing him back against the wall.\n\"The fact is,\" he twisted at his black mustache and eyed us each\nfor a second in turn, looking as handsome as the devil, \"that I have\nfound what I originally set out to look for.  It overlooks Zeitoon,\nhidden among trees.  I propose to use it.  As for quixotism--is\nthere any one here not willing to fight in the last ditch to help\nKagig and these Armenians?\"\n\n\"I'm with you!\" laughed Gloria, and she and Will had a scuffle over\nnear the fireplace.\n\n\"I knew what to expect of the women,\" said Monty rather bitterly.\n\"I'm speaking to Fred and the men!\"\n\n\"Where's Peter Measel?\" I asked.  But the others did not see\nthe connection.\n\n\"Come along,\" said Monty.  \"Seems to me we're wasting time,\" and\nhe strode out through the window on to the roof of the house\nbelow--usually the shortest way from point to point in Zeitoon.  Kagig\nfollowed him, and then Rustum Khan.  The stars were no longer shining\nin the pale sky overhead, but it was dark where we were because of\nthe mountains that shut out the dawn.  Fred came last, grumbling\nand stumbling, too disturbed to look where he was going.\n\n\"Fancy me acting Cassandra at my time of life and none to believe\nme!\" he muttered.  Then, louder:  \"I warn you all!  I know that\nfellow Monty.  If he comes out of this alive it'll be because we\nhaul him out by the hair!  Won't you listen?\"\n\nOutside the window I remembered the field-glasses I had laid down\nin a corner, and returned to get them.  In the room were Maga and\nthe woman Anna, who had appointed herself Gloria Vanderman's maid;\nthey were apparently about to sweep the floor and tidy the place,\nbut as I crossed the room an older gipsy woman entered by the door,\nand she and Maga promptly drove Anna out through the window after\nmy party.  Then the old woman came close to me, her beady bright\neyes fixed on mine, and went through the suggestive gipsy motions\nthat invite the crossing of a palm with silver.\n\nThere seemed at first no excuse for listening to her.  Every gipsy\nwill beg, whether there is need or not, and knowledge of their habits\ndid not make me less short-tempered;  besides I had no silver within\nreach, nor time to waste.\n\n\"Not now!\" I said, pushing her aside.\n\nBut Maga came to her rescue, and clutched my arm.\n\n\"See!\" she said, and took a Maria Theresa dollar from some hiding-place\nin her skirt.  \"I give silver for you.  So.\"  The old hag pouched\nthe coin with exactly the same avidity with which she would have\ntaken it from me.  \"Now she will make magic.  Then I see.  Then I\ntell you something.  You listen!\"\n\nIt began to dawn on me that I would better listen after all.  Every\nhuman is superstitious, whether or not he admits if to himself;\nbut the particular fraud of pretending to tell fortunes never did\nhappen to find the joint in my own armor.  It seemed likely these\ntwo women had some plan that included the preliminary deception of\nmyself, and the sooner I knew something about it the better.  So\nI sat down on Kagig's stool, to give them a better opinion of their\nadvantage over me, there being nothing like making the enemy too\nconfident.  Then I held out the palm of my hand for inspection and\ntried to look like a man pretending he does not believe in magic.\nWhatever Maga thought, the old hag was delighted.  She began to croak\nan incantation, shuffling first with one foot, then with the other,\nand finally with both together in a weird dance that almost shook\nher old frame apart.  Then she went through a pantomime of\nfinger-pointing, as if transferring from herself to Maga the gift\nof divining about me.\n\nPresently, standing a little to one side of me, with eyes on the\nold hag's and my hand held between her two, Maga began chanting in\nEnglish.  The fact that her voice was musical and low where the bag's\nhad been high-pitched and rasping heightened interest, if nothing else.\n\n\"You now four men,\" she began, with a little pause, and something\nlike a swallow between each sentence.  \"You all love one another\nver' much.  You all like Kagig.  Kagig is liking you.  But Turks\nare coming presently, and they keel Kagig--keel heem, you understan'?\nThat man Monty is also keel--keel dead.  That man Fred--I not know--I\nnot see.  You I see----you I see two ways.  First way, you marry\nthat woman Gloria--you go away--all well--all good.  Second way--you\nnot marry her.  Then you all die--dam' quick--Monty, Fred, Will,\nyou, Gloria, everybody--an' Zeitoon is all burn' up by bloody Turks!\"\n\nShe paused and looked at me sidewise under lowered eyelids.  I stared\nstraight in front of me, as if in the state of self-hypnotism that\nis the fortune-teller's happy hunting-ground.\n\n\"You understan'?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.  \"I think I see.  But how shall I marry Miss Gloria?\nSuppose she does not want me?\"\n\n\"You must!  Never mind what she want!  Listen!  This is only way\nto save your frien's and Zeitoon!  I am giving men--four--five--six\nmen.  They are seizing Gloria.  You go with them.  They take you\nsafe away.  Then Zeitoon is also safe, an' your frien's are also safe.\"\n\n\"Monty, too?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, then he is also safe.\"  But--I felt her hands tremble slightly\nas she said that.\n\n\"Do you mean I should leave him?\" I asked.\n\n\"You must!  You must!\"  She almost screamed at me, and shook my hand\nbetween her two palms as if by that means to drive the fact into\nmy consciousness.  The old hag had her eyes fixed on my right temple\nas if she would burn a hole there, and between them they were making\na better than amateur effort to control me by suggestion.  It seemed\nwise to help them deceive themselves.  Maga let go my hand gently,\nand began passing her ten fingers very softly through my hair, and\nthere are other men who will bear me witness that there exists sensation\nless appealing than when a pretty girt does that.\n\n\"You must!\" she said again more quietly.  \"That is the only way to\nsave Zeitoon.  God is angry.\"\n\n\"What do you know about God?\" I asked unguardedly, knowing well that\nwhatever their open pretenses, gipsies despise all religion except\ndiabolism.  They study creeds for the sake of plunder, just as hunters\nstudy the habits of the wild.\n\n\"Maybe nothing--maybe much!  Peter Measel, he say--\"\n\nShe paused, as if in doubt whether she was using the right argument.\nAnd in that moment I recalled what Rustum Khan had once said about\nher being no true gipsy.\n\n\"Go on,\" I urged her.  \"Peter Measel is an expert.  He's a high priest.\nHe knows it all.\"\n\n\"Peter Measel is saying,  God is ver' angry with Zeitoon and is sending\nto destroy such bloody people what plan fighting and rebellion.\"\n\n\"I'll think it over,\" I said, moving to get up.  But independent\nthinking was the last thing that Maga intended to permit me.\n\n\"No, no!  No, no, no!  You must dee-cide now--at once!  There is\nno time.  Now--now I give you five--six mens--now they seize that\nwoman Gloria--now you carry 'er away into the mountains--now you\nmake 'er yours--your own, you understan', so as she is ashamed to\ndeny it afterward--yes?--you see?\"\n\n\"Where are the men?\" I demanded.\n\n\"I fetch them quick!\"\n\nI could see the hilt of her knife, and the bulge of her repeating\npistol, but I could also feel the weight of my own loaded Colt against\nmy hip. I did not doubt I could escape before her men could arrive\non the scene, but that would have been to leave some secret only\npart uncovered.  There was obviously more behind this scheme than\nmet the ear.  It is my experience that if we throw fear to the winds,\nand are willing to wait in tight places for the necessary inspiration,\nthen we get it.\n\n\"Very well,\" I said.  \"I agree.  Bring your men.\"\n\n\"You wait.  I get 'em.\"\n\nI nodded, and she said something in the gipsy language to the old\nhag, who went out through the door in a hurry.  Alone with Maga I\nfelt less than half as safe as I had been.  She proceeded to make\nuse of every moment in the manner they say makes millionaires.\n\n\"Gloria, she is ver' nice girl!\"  She made a wonderful gesture of\nboth hands that limned in empty air the curves of her detested rival.\n\"You will love her.  By-and-by she love you--also ver' much.\"\n\nThe thought flashed through my head again that I ought to escape\nwhole while I had the chance;  but the answer to that was the certainty\nthat she would thence-forward be on guard against me without having\ngiven me any real information.  I was perfectly convinced there was\na deep plot underlying the foolishness she had proposed.  The fact\nthat she considered me so venial and so gullible was no proof that\nthe hidden purpose was not dangerous.  The mystery was how to seem\nto be fooled by her and yet get in touch with my friends.  Then\nsuddenly I recalled that she and the hag had been trying to use\nthe gipsy's black art.  Unless they can trick their victim into a\nmental condition in which innate superstition becomes uppermost,\nplayers of that dark game are helpless.\n\nYet gipsies are more superstitious than any one else.  Hanging to\nher neck by a skein of plaited horse-hair was the polished shell\nof a minute turtle--smaller than a dollar piece.\n\n\"Give me that,\" I said, \"for luck,\" and she jumped at the idea.\n\n\"Yes, yes--that is to bring you luck--ver' much luck!\"\n\nShe snatched it off and hung it around my neck, pushing the turtle-shell\ndown under my collar out of sight.\n\n\"That is love-token!\" she whispered.  \"Now she love you immediate'!\nNow you 'ave ver' much luck!\"\n\nThe last part of her prophecy was true.  The luck seemed to change.\nThat instant the key was given me to escape without making her my\nrelentless enemy, a voice that I would know among a million began\nshouting for me petulantly from somewhere half a dozen roofs away.\n\n\"What in hell's keeping you, man?  Here's Monty getting up a tourist\nparty to his damned ancestral nest and you're delaying the whole shebang!\nGood lord alive!  Have you fallen in love with a woman, or taken\nthe belly-ache, or fallen down a well, or gone to sleep again, or\nall of them, or what?\"\n\n\"Coming, Fred!\" I shouted.  \"Coming!\"\n\n\"You'd better!\"\n\nHe began playing cat-calls on his concertina--imitation bugle-calls,\nand fragments of serenades.  For a second Maga looked reckless--then\nsuspicious--then, as it began to dawn on her from studying my face\nthat I, too, was afraid of Fred, relieved.\n\n\"Does he know anything?\" I asked her.\n\n\"He?  That Fred?  No!  No, no, no!  An' you no tell 'im.  You 'ear\nme? You no tell 'im!  You go now--go to 'im, or else 'e is get\nsuspicious--understan'?  My men--they go an' get that woman.  When\nthey finish getting that woman, then I send for you an' you come\nquick--understan'?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"Listen!  If you tell your frien's--if you tell that Frrred, or those\nothers--then I not only keel you, but my men put out your eyes first\nan' then pull off your toes an' fingers--understan'?\"\n\nI shrugged my shoulders, suggesting an attempt to seem at ease.\n\n\"Besides--I warn you!  You tell Kagig anything against me an' Kagig\nis at once your enemy!\"\n\nI nodded, and tried to look afraid.  Perhaps the speculation that\nthe last boast started in my mind helped give me a look that\nconvinced her.\n\nFred began calling again.\n\n\"You go!\" she ordered imperiously, with a last effort to impress\nme with her mental predominance.  \"Go quickly!\"\n\nI made motions of hand and face as nearly suggestive of underhanded\ncunning as I could compass, and climbed out through the window without\nfurther invitation. Seeing me emerge, Fred beckoned from fifty yards\naway and turned his back.  Morning was just beginning to descend\ninto the valley, suddenly bright from having finished all the dawn\ndelays among the crags higher up; but there were deep shadows here\nand especially where one roof overhung another.\n\nJumping from roof to roof to follow Fred, I was suddenly brought\nup short by a figure in shadow that gesticulated wildly without\nspeaking.  It was below me, in a narrow, shallow runway between\ntwo houses, and I had been so impressed by my interview with Maga\nthat assassination was the first thought ready to mind.  I sprang\naside and tried to check myself, missed footing, and fell into the\nvery runway I had tried to avoid.\n\nA friend unmistakable, Anna--Gloria's self-constituted maid--ran\nout of the darkest shadow and kept me from scrambling to my feet.\n\n\"Wait!\" she whispered.  \"Don't be seen talking to me.  Listen!\"\n\nMy ankle pained considerably and I was out of breath.  I was willing\nenough to lie there.\n\n\"Maga has made a plot to betray Zeitoon!  She has been talking with\nthat Turkish colonel who was captured.  I don't know what the plot\nis, but I listened through a chink in the wall of the prison, and\nI heard him promise that she should have Will Yerkes!\"\n\n\"What else did you hear?\"\n\n\"Nothing else.  There was wind whistling, and the straw made a noise.\"\n\nAt that moment Fred chose to turn his head to see whether I was\nfollowing.  Not seeing me, he came back over the roofs, shouting\nto know what had happened.  I got to my feet but, although he hardly\nlooks the part, he is as active as a boy, and he had scrambled to\na higher roof that commanded a view of my runway before my twisted\nankle would permit me to escape.\n\n\"So that's it, eh?  A woman!\"\n\n\"Keep an eye on Miss Gloria!\"  I whispered to Anna, and she ducked\nand ran.\n\nIf I had had presence of mind I would have accepted the insinuation,\nand turned the joke on Fred.  Instead, I denied it hotly like a fool,\nand nothing could have fed the fires of his spirit of raillery\nmore surely.\n\n\"I've unearthed a plot,\" I began, limping along beside him.\n\n\"No, sir!  It was I who unearthed the two of you!\"\n\n\"See here, Fred--\"\n\n\"Look?  I'd be ashamed!  No, no--I wasn't looking!\"\n\n\"Fred, I'm serious!\"\n\n\"Entanglements with women are always serious!\"\n\n\"I tell you, that girl Maga--\"\n\n\"Two of 'em, eh?  Worser and worser!  You'll have Will jealous into\nthe bargain!\"\n\n\"Have it your own way, then!\" I said, savage with pain (and the reasons\nhe did not hesitate to assign to my strained ankle were simply\nscandalous).  \"I'll wait until I find a man with honest ears.\"\n\n\"Try Kagig!\" he advised me dryly.\n\nAnd Kagig I did try.  We came on him at our end of the bridge that\noverhung the Jihun River.  Our party were waiting on the far side,\nand Fred hurried over to join them.  Kagig was listening to the reports\nof a dozen men, and while I waited to get his ear I could see Fred\ntelling his great joke to the party.  It was easy to see that Gloria\nVanderman did not enjoy the joke;  nor did I blame her.  I did not\nblame her for sending word there and then to Anna that her services\nwould not be required any more.\n\nAs soon as Kagig saw me he dismissed the other men in various directions\nand made to start across the bridge.  I called to him to wait, and\nwalked beside him.\n\n\"I've uncovered a plot, Kagig,\" I began.  \"Maga Jhaere has been talking\nwith the Turkish prisoner.\"\n\n\"I know it.  I sent her to talk with him!\"\n\n\"She has bargained with him to betray Zeitoon!\"\n\nFor answer to that Kagig turned his head and stared sharply at me--then\nwent off into peals of diabolic laughter.  He had not a word\nto offer.  He simply utterly, absolutely, unqualifiedly disbelieved\nme--or else chose to have it appear so.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Eighteen\n\"Per terram et aquam.\"\n\n\nAND HE WHO WOULD SAVE HIS LIFE SHALL LOSE IT\n\nThe fed fools beat their brazen gong\nFor gods' ears dulled by blatant praise,\nAwonder why the scented fumes\nAnd surplices at evensong\nAvail not as in other days.\nShrunken and mean the spirit fails\nLike old snow falling from the crags\nAnd priest and pedagog compete\nWith nostrums for the age that ails,\nBut learn not why the spirit lags.\nTuneless and dull the loose lyre thrums\nIll-plucked by fingers strange to skill\nThat change and change the fever'd chords,\nBut still no inspiration comes\nThough priest and pundit labor still.\nLust-urged the clamoring clans denounce\nWhate'er their sires agreed was good,\nAnd swift on faith and fair return\nWith lies the feud-leaders pounce\nLest Truth deprive them of their food.\nDog eateth dog and none gives thanks;\nAll crave the fare, but grudge the price\nTheir nobler forbears proudly paid,\nThat now for moonstruck madness ranks--\nThe only true coin--Sacrifice!\n\n\nThe man who is a hero to himself perhaps exists, but the surface\nindications are no proof of it.  I don't pretend to be satisfied,\nand made no pretense at the time of being satisfied with my share\nin Maga's treachery.  But I claim that it was more than human nature\ncould have done, to endure the open disapproval of my friends, begun\nby Fred's half-earnest jest, and continued by my own indignation;\nand at the same time to induce them to take my warning seriously.\n\nWill avoided me, and walked with Gloria, who made no particular secret\nof her disgust.  Fred naturally enough kept the joke going, to save\nhimself from being tripped in his own net.  He had probably persuaded\nhimself by that time that the accusation was true, and therefore\nequally probably regretted having made it;  for he would have been\nthe last man in the world to give tongue about an offense that he\nreally believed a friend of his had committed.\n\nMonty, who believed from force of habit every single word Fred said,\nwalked beside me and was good enough to give me fatherly advice.\n\n\"Not the time, you know, to fool with women.  I don't pretend, of\ncourse, to any right to judge your private conduct, but--you can\nbe so awfully useful, you know, and all that kind of thing, when\nyou're paying strict attention.  Women distract a man.\"\n\nAll, things considered, I might have done worse than decide to say\nno more about the plot, but to keep my own eyes wide open.  (I was\nparticularly sore with Gloria, and derived much unwise consolation\nfrom considering stinging remarks I would make to her when the actual\ntruth should out.)\n\nMonty began making the best of my, in his eyes, damaged character\nby explaining the general dispositions he and Kagig had made for\nthe defense of Zeitoon.\n\n\"According to my view of it,\" he said, \"this bridge we've just crossed\nis the weakest point--or was.  I think we can hold that clay ramp\nyou came up yesterday against all comers.  But there's a way round\nthe back of this mountain that leads to the dismantled fort you see\non this side of the river.  That is the fort built by the Turkish\nsoldiers whom Kagig told us the women of Zeitoon threw one by one\nover the bridge.\"\n\nHe stopped (we had climbed about two hundred feet of a fairly steep\ntrack leading up the flank of Beirut Dagh) and let the others gather\naround us.\n\n\"You see, if the enemy can once establish a footing on this hill,\nthey'll then command the whole of Zeitoon opposite with rifle fire,\neven if they don't succeed in bringing artillery round the mountain.\"\n\nBetween us and Zeitoon there now lay a deep, sheer-sided gash, down\nat the bottom of which the Jihun brawled and boiled.  I did not envy\nany army faced with the task of crossing it, even supposing the bridge\nshould not be destroyed.  But they would not need to cross in order\nto make the town untenable.\n\n\"The Zeitoonli are, you might say, superstitious about that bridge,\"\nMonty went on.  \"They refuse as much as to consider making arrangements\nto blow it up in case of need.  Another remarkable thing is that\nthe women claim the bridge defense as their privilege.  That doesn't\nmatter.  They look like a crowd of last-ditch fighters, and we're\nawfully short of men.  But we're almost equally short of ammunition;\nand if it ever gets to the point where we're driven in so that we\nhave to hold that bridge, we shall be doling out cartridges one by\none to the best shots!  I have tried to persuade the women to leave\nthe bridge until there's need of defending it, and to lend us a\nhand elsewhere meanwhile;  but they've always held the bridge, and\nthey propose to do the same again.  Even Kagig can't shift them,\nalthough the women have been his chief supporters all along.\"\n\nFred interrupted, pointing toward a few acres of level land to our\nleft, below Zeitoon village but still considerably above the\nriver level.\n\n\"Is that Rustum Khan?\"\n\n\"He it is,\" said Kagig.  \"A devil of a man--a wonder of a devil--no\nfriend of mine, yet I shook hands with him and I salute him!  A genius!\nA cavalryman born.  Our people are not cavalrymen.  No place for\nhorses, this.  Yet, as you have seen, there are some of us who can\nride, and that Rustum Khan found many others--refugees from this\nand that place.  See how he drills them yonder--see!  It was the\ngift of God that so many horses fell into our hands.  Some of the\nrefugees brought horses along for food.  Instead, Rustum Khan took\nmen's corn away, to feed the hungry horses!\"\n\n\"We could never have held the place without Rustum Khan,\" said Monty.\n\"As it is we've a chance.  The last thing the Turks will expect from\nus is mounted tactics.  Allowing for plenty of spare horses, we shall\nhave two full squadrons--one under Rustum Khan, and one I'll lead\nmyself.  From all accounts they're bringing an awful number of men\nagainst us, and we expect them to try to force the clay ramp.  In\nthat case--but come and see.\"\n\nHe led on up-hill, and after a few minutes the well-worn track\ndisappeared, giving place to a newly cleared one.  Trees had been\ncut down roughly, leaving stumps in such irregular profusion that,\nthough horses could pass between them easily, no wheeled traffic\ncould have gone that way.  The undergrowth and the tree-trunks had\nbeen piled along either side, so that the new path was fenced in.\nIt was steep and crooked, every section of it commanded by some\nother section higher up, with plenty of crags and boulders that\nafforded even better cover than the trees.\n\n\"Discovered this the first day I got here,\" said Monty.  \"Asked\nabout bears, and a man offered to show me where a dozen of them lived.\nI was curious to see where a 'dozen bears could live in amity\ntogether--didn't believe a word of it.  We set out that afternoon,\nand didn't reach the top until midnight.  Worst climb I ever experienced.\nLost ourselves a hundred times.  Next day, however, Kagig agreed to let\nme have as many men as could be crowded together to work, and I took\na hundred and twenty.  Set them to cutting this trail and another\none.  They worked like beavers.  But come along and look.\"\n\n\"How about the bears?\" Fred demanded.  \"Did you get them?\"\n\n\"Smelt 'em.  Saw one--or saw his shadow, and heard him.  Followed\nhim up-hill by the smell, and so found the castle wall.  Haven't\nseen a bear since.\"\n\n\"Hssh!\" said Kagig, and sprang up-hill ahead of us to take the lead.\n\"There are guards above there, and they are true Zeitoonli--they\nwill shoot dam' quick!\"\n\nThey did not shoot, because we all lay in the shadow of a great\nrock as soon as we could see a ragged stone wall uplifted against\nthe purple sky, and Kagig whistled half a dozen times.  We plainly\nheard the snap of breech-blocks being tested.\n\n\"They are weary of talking fight!\" Kagig whispered.\n\nBut the sixth or seventh whistle was answered by a shout, and we\nbegan to climb again.  Close to the castle the tree-cutters had been\nable to follow the line of the original road fairly closely, and\nthere were places underfoot that actually seemed to have been paved.\nFinally we reached a steep ramp of cemented stone blocks, not one\nof which was out of place, and went up that toward an arch--clear,\nunmistakable, round Roman that had once been closed by a portcullis\nand an oak gate.  All of the woodwork had long ago disappeared, but\nthere was little the matter with the masonry.\n\nUnder the echoing arch we strode into a shadowy courtyard where the\nsun had not penetrated long enough to warm the stones.  In the midst\nof it a great stone keep stood as grim and almost as undecayed as\nwhen Crusaders last defended it.  That castle had never been built\nby Crusaders;  they had found it standing there, and had added to\nit, Norman on to Roman.\n\nThe courtyard was littered with weeds that Kagig's men had slashed\ndown, and here and there a tree had found root room and forced its\nway up between the rough-hewn paving stones.  Animals had laired\nin the place, and had left their smell there together with an air\nof wilderness.  But now a new-old smell, and new-old sounds were\nawakening the past.  There were horses again in the stables, whose\nroof formed the fighting-platform behind the rampart of the outer wall.\n\nMonty led the way to the old arched entrance of the keep, and pointed\nupward to a spot above the arch where some one had been scraping\nand scrubbing away the stains of time.  There, clean white now in\nthe midst of rusty stonework, was a carved device--shield-shaped--two\nships and two wheat-sheaves;  and underneath on a scroll the motto\nin Latin--Per terram et aquam--By land and sea--in token that the\nold Montdidiers held themselves willing to do duty on either element.\nThe same device and the same motto were on the gold signet ring on\nMonty's little finger.\n\n\"What's happening on top of the keep?\" demanded Will.\n\nFred laughed aloud.  We could not see up from inside, for at least\none of the stone floors remained intact.\n\n\"Can't you guess?\" demanded Fred.  \"Didn't I tell you the man has\n'verted to Crusader days?\"\n\nBut Monty explained.\n\n\"There's an old stone socket up there that used to hold the flag-pole.\nTwo or three fellows have been kind enough to haul a tree up there,\nand they're trimming it to fit.\"\n\n\"If we were wise we'd hang you to it, Didums, and save you from a\nlousy Turkish jail!\"\n\n\"Thank you, Fred,\" Monty answered.  \"There are capitulations still,\nI fancy.  No Turk can legally try me, or imprison me a minute.  I'm\nanswerable to the British consul.\"\n\n\"They're fine, legal-minded sticklers for the rules, the Turks are!\"\nFred retorted.\n\n\"But we've a net laid for the Turks!\" smiled Monty.\n\nFred shook his head.  Monty led the way toward stone steps, whose\ntreads bad been worn into smooth hollows centuries before by the\nfeet of men in armor.\n\nUp above on the outer rampart we could see Kagig's sentries outlined\nagainst the sky, protected against the chilly mountain air by\ngoat-skin outer garments and pointed goat-skin hats.  We mounted\nthe stone stair, holding to a baluster worn smooth by the rub of\ncountless forgotten hands, as perfect yet as on the day when the\nmasons pronounced it finished;  and emerged on to a wide stone floor\nabove the stables, guarded by a breast-high parapet pierced by slits\nfor archers.\n\nFrom below the breathing of the pines came up to us, peculiarly\naudible in spite of the Titan roar of Jihun River.  Immediately below\nus was a ledge of forest-covered rock, and beyond that we could see\nsheer down the tree-draped flank of Beirut Dagh to the foaming water.\nWe leaned our elbows on the parapet, and stared in silence all in\na row, stared at in turn by the more than half-suspicious sentries.\n\n\"How does it feel, old man\" asked Will at last, \"standing on ramparts\nwhere your ancestors once ruled the roost?\"\n\n\"Stranger than perhaps you think,\" Monty answered, not looking to\nright or left, or downward, but away out in front of him toward the\nsky-line on top of the opposite hills.\n\n\"I bet I know,\" said Will.  \"You hate to see the old order passing.\nYou'd like the old times back.\"\n\n\"You're wrong for once, America!\"  Monty turned his back on the\nparapet and the view, and with hands thrust deep down in his pockets\nsought for words that could explain a little of his inner man.  Fred\nhad perhaps seen that mood before, but none of the rest of us.\nUsually he would talk of anything except his feelings.  He felt the\ndifficulty now, and checked.\n\n\"How so?\" demanded Will.\n\n\"I've watched the old order passing.  I'm part of it.  I'm passing, too.\"\n\nGloria watched him with melting eyes.  Fred turned his back and went\nthrough the fruitless rigmarole of trying to appear indifferent,\ngoing to the usual length at last of humming through his nose.\n\n\"That's what I said.  You'd like these castle days back again.\"\n\n\"You're wrong, Will.  I pray they never may come back.  The place\nis an anachronism.  So am I!--useless for most modern purposes.\nYou'd have to tear castle or me so to pieces that we'd be unrecognizable.\nThe world is going forward, and I'm glad of it.  It shall have no\nhindrance at my hands.\"\n\n\"If men were all like you--\" began Gloria, but he checked her with\na frown.\n\n\"You can call this castle a robbers' nest, if you like.  It's easy\nto call names.  It stood for the best men knew in those days--protection\nof the countryside, such law and order as men understood, and the\nopen road.  It was built primarily to keep the roads safe.  There\nare lots of things in England and America to-day, Will, that your\ndescendants (being fools) will sneer at, just as it's the fashion\nto-day to sneer at relics of the past like this--and me!\"\n\n\"Who's sneering?  Not I!  Not we!\"\n\n\"This castle was built for the sake of the countryside.  I've a mind\nto see it end as it began--that's all.\"\n\n\"Aw--what's eating you, Monty?\"\n\n\"Shut up croaking, you old raven!\" grumbled Fred.\n\n\"Show us the view you promised.  This isn't it, for there isn't a\nTurk in sight.\"\n\nMonty knew better than mistake Fred's surliness for anything but\nfriendship in distress.  Without another word he led the way along\nthe parapet toward a ragged tower at the southern corner.  It had\nbeen built by Normans, evidently added to the earlier Roman wall.\n\n\"Now tell me if the old folk didn't know their business,\" said Monty.\n\"Very careful, all!  The steps inside are rough.  The roof has fallen\nin, and the ragged upper edge that's left probably accounts for the\ncastle remaining undetected from below all these years--looks like\nfangs of discolored rock.\"\n\nWe followed him through the doorless gap in the tower wall, and up\nbroken stone stairs littered with fragments of the fallen roof, until\nwe stood at last in a half-circle around the jagged rim, our feet\nwedged between rotten masonry, breasts against the saw-edge parapet,\nand heads on a level with the eagles.  From that dizzy height we\nhad a full view between the mountains, not only of the immediate\nenvirons of Zeitoon, but of most of the pass--up which we ourselves\nhad come, and of some of the open land beyond it.\n\n\"D'you see Turks now?\"\n\nMonty pointed, but there was no need.  Dense masses of men were\nbivouacked beyond the bottom of the wide clay ramp.  Through the\nglasses I could see artillery and supply wagons.  They were coming\nto make a thorough job of \"rescuing\" Zeitoon this time!  After a\nwhile I was able to make out the dark irregular line of Kagig's men,\nand here and there the lighter color of freshly dug entrenchments.\nNone of Zeitoon's defenders appeared to be thrown out beyond the\nclay ramp, but they evidently flanked it on the side of the pass\nthat was farthest from us.\n\n\"Now look this way, and you'll understand.\"\n\nMonty pointed to our right, and the significance of the voices we\nhad heard so close to us when Fred was searching for a path around\nthe clay on the morning of our arrival, was made plain instantly.\nDown from the ledge on which the castle stood to a point apparently\nwithin a few yards of the clay ramp there had been cut a winding\nswath through the forest, along which four horses abreast could be\nridden, or as many men marched.\n\n\"How did you do all that in time?\" demanded Will.  \"It looks like\none of those contractor's jobs in the States--put through while you\nwait and to hell with everything!\"\n\n\"It follows the old road,\" Monty answered.  \"There was too much\ncobble-paving for the trees to take hold, and most of what they had\nto cut was small stuff.  That accounts, too, for the freedom from\nstumps.  But, do you get the idea?  The trees between the end of\nthe cutting and the clay ramp are cut almost through--ready to fall,\nin fact.  I'm afraid of a wind.  If it blows, our screen may fall\ntoo soon!  But if the Turks try to storm the ramp, we'll draw them\non.  Then, hey--presto!  Down go the remaining trees, and into the\nmiddle of 'em rides our cavalry!\"\n\n\"What's the use of cavalry four abreast?\" demanded Fred, in no mood\nto be satisfied with anything.\n\n\"Rustum Khan is concentrating all his energy on teaching that one\nmaneuver,\" Monty answered.  \"We come--\"\n\n\"Thought it 'ud be 'we!'  Your place is at the rear, giving orders!\"\n\n\"We come down the track at top speed, and the impetus will carry\nus clear across the ramp.  Some of the horses'll go down, because\nthe slope is slippery.  But the remainder will front form squadron,\nand charge down hill in line.  Then watch!\"\n\n\"All right,\" Fred grumbled.  \"But how about you rear while all that's\ngoing on?  The Turk must have worked his way around Beirut Dagh on\nformer occasions--or how else could he ever have built and held that\ndismantled fort?  What's to stop him from doing it again?\"\n\n\"It's a fifteen-mile fight ahead of him,\" Monty answered, \"with\nriflemen posted at every vantage-point all the way--\"\n\n\"Who is in charge of the riflemen?\"\n\nKagig leaned back until he looked in danger of falling, and tapped\nhis breast significantly three times.\n\n\"I--I have picked the men who will command those riflemen and women!\"\n\n\"Well,\" Fred grumbled, \"what are your plans for us?\"\n\n\"For the last time, Fred, I want you, old man, to help me to persuade\nthese others to escape into the hills while there's still a chance,\nand I want you to go with them.\"\n\n\"I also!\" exclaimed Kagig.  \"I also desire that!\"\n\n\"Now you've got that off your chest, Didums, suppose you talk sense,\"\nsuggested Fred.  \"What are your plans?\"\n\nMonty recognized the unalterable, and set his face.\n\n\"You first, Miss Vanderman.  There's one way in which we can always\nuse a gentlewoman's services.\"\n\n\"Mayn't I fight?\" she begged, and we all laughed.\n\n\"'Fraid not.  No.  The women have cleared out several houses for\na hospital.  Please go and superintend.\"\n\n\"Damn!\" exclaimed Gloria, Boston fashion, not in the least under\nher breath.\n\n\"I am sending word,\" said Kagig, \"that they shall obey you or learn\nfrom me!\"\n\n\"The rest of us,\" Monty went on, \"will know better what to do when\nwe know what the Turk intends, but I expect to send all of you from\ntime to time to wherever the fighting is thickest.  Kagig, of course,\nwill please himself, and my orders are subject to his approval.\"\n\n\"I'll go, then,\" said Gloria.  \"Good-by!\"  And she kissed Will on\nthe mouth in full view of all of us, he blushing furiously, and Kagig\ncracking all his finger-joints.\n\n\"Go with her, Will!\" urged Monty, as she disappeared down the steps.\n\"Go and save yourself.  You're young.  I've notions of my own that\nI've inherited, and the world calls me a back number.  You go with\nMiss Vanderman!\"\n\nI seconded that motion.\n\n\"Go with her, Will!  I've warned you she's unsafe alone!  Go and\nprotect her!\"\n\nWill grinned, wholly without malice.\n\n\"Thanks!\" he said.  \"She's a back number, too.  So'm I!  If I left\nMonty in this pinch she'd never look at me, and I'd not ask her to!\nInherited notions about merit and all that kind of thing, don't you\nknow, by gosh!  No, sir!  She and I both sat into this game.  She\nand I both stay!  Wish Esau would open the ball, though.  I'm tired\nof talking.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter Nineteen\n\"Such drilling as they have had--such little drilling!\"\n\n\nICH DIEN\n\nIs honor out of fashion and the men she named\nFit only to be buried and defamed\nWho dared hold service was true nobleness\nAnd graced their service in a fitting dress?\nAre manners out of date because the scullions scoff\nAt whosoever shuns the common trough\nLiking dry bread better than the garbled stew\nNor praising greed because the style is new?\nLet go the ancient orders if so be their ways\nAre trespassing on decency these days.\nSo I go, rather than accept the trampled spoil\nOr gamble for what great men earned by toil.\nFor rather than trade honor for a mob's foul praise\nI'll keep full fealty to the ancient ways\nAnd, hoistinq my forebear's banner in the face of hell,\nWill die beneath it, knowing I die well!\n\n\nFifteen minutes after Gloria Vanderman left us I saw a banner go\njerkily mounting up the newly placed flag-pole on the keep.  A man\nblew a bugle hoarsely by way of a salute.  I raised my hat.  Monty\nraised his.  In a moment we were all standing bare-headed, and the\ngreat square piece of cloth caught the wind that whistled between\ntwo crags of Beirut Dagh.\n\nFred, our arch-iconoclast, stood uncovered longest.\n\n\"Who the devil made it for you?\" he inquired.\n\nStitched on the banner in colored cloth were the two wheat-sheaves\nand two ships of the Montdidiers, and a scroll stretched its length\nacross the bottom, with the motto doubtless, although in the wind\none could not read it.\n\n\"The women.  Good of 'em, what?  Miss Vanderman drew it on paper.\nThey cut it out, and sat up last night sewing it.\"\n\n\"I suppose you know that's filibustering, to fly your private banner\non foreign soil?\"\n\n\"They may call it what they please,\" said Monty.  \"I can't well fly\nthe flag of England, and Armenia has none yet.  Let's go below, Fred,\nand see if there's any news.\"\n\n\"Yes, there is news,\" said Kagig, leading the way down.  \"I did not\nsay it before the lady.  It is not good news.\"\n\n\"That's the only kind that won't keep.  Spit it out!\" said Will.\n\nKagig faced us on the stable roof, and his finger-joints cracked again.\n\n\"It is the worst!  They have sent Mahmoud Bey, against us. I would\nrather any six other Turks.  Mahmoud Bey is not a fool.  He is a\nyoung successful man, who looks to this campaign to bolster his ambition.\nHe is a ruthless brute!\"\n\n\"Which Turk isn't?\" asked Will.\n\n\"This one is most ruthless.  This Mahmoud is the one who in the\nmassacres of five years ago caused Armenian prisoners to have\nhorse-shoes nailed to their naked feet, in order, he said, that\nthey might march without hurt.  He will waste no time about\npreliminaries!\"\n\nKagig was entirely right.  Mahmoud Bey began the overture that very\ninstant with artillery fire directed at the hidden defenses flanking\nthe clay ramp.  Next we caught the stuttering chorus of his machine\nguns, and the intermittent answer of Kagig's riflemen.\n\n\"Now, effendim, one of you down to the defenses, please!  There is\nrisk my men may use too many cartridges.  Talk to them--restrain them.\nThey might listen to me, but--\"  His long fingers suggested unhappy\nfragments of past history.\n\n\"You, Fred!\" said Monty, and Fred hitched his concertina to a more\ncomfortable angle.\n\nFred was the obvious choice.  His gift of tongues would enable him\nbetter than any of us to persuade, and if need were, compel.  We\nhad left our rifles leaning by the wall at the castle entrance, and\nin his cartridge bag was my oil-can and rag-bag.  I asked him for\nthem, and he threw them to me rather clumsily.  Trying to catch\nthem I twisted for the second time the ankle I had hurt that morning.\nFred mounted and rode out through the echoing entrance without a\nbackward glance, and I sat down and pulled my boot off, for the agony\nwas almost unendurable.\n\n\"That settles your task for to-day,\" laughed Monty.  \"Help him back\nto the top of the tower, Will.  Keep me informed of everything you\nsee.  Will--you go with Kagig after you've helped him up there.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Will. \"Where's Kagig bound for?\"\n\n\"Round behind Beirut Dagh,\" Kagig announced grimly.  \"That's our\ndanger-point.  If the Turks force their way round the mountain--\"\nHe shrugged his expressive shoulders.  Only he of all of us seemed\nto view the situation seriously.  I think we others felt a thrill\nrather of sport than of danger.\n\nI might have been inclined to resent the inactivity assigned to me,\nonly that it gave me a better chance than I had hoped for of watching\nfor signs of Maga Jhaere's promised treachery.  Will helped me up\nand made the perch comfortable;  then he and Kagig rode away together.\nPresently Monty, too, mounted a mule, and rode out under the arch,\nand fifteen minutes later fifty men marched in by twos, laughing\nand joking, and went to saddling the horses in the semicircular stable\nbelow me.  After that all the world seemed to grow still for a while,\nexcept for the eagles, the distant rag-slitting rattle of rifle-fire,\nand the occasional bursting of a shell.  Most of the shells were\nfalling on the clay ramp, and seemed to be doing no harm whatever.\n\nAway in the distance down the pass, out of range of the fire of our\nmen, but also incapable of harm themselves until they should advance\ninto the open jaws below the clay ramp, I could see the Turks massing\nin that sort of dense formation that the Germans teach.  Even through\nthe glasses it was not possible to guess their numbers, because the\nangle of vision was narrow and cut off their flanks to right and\nleft;  but I sent word down to Monty that a frontal attack in force\nseemed to be already beginning.\n\nFor an hour after that, while the artillery fire increased but our\nrifle-fire seemed to dwindle under Fred's persuasive tongue, I watched\nMonty mustering reenforcements in the gorge below the town.  He\novercame some of the women's prejudice, for it was a force made up\nof men and women that he presently led away.  I was rather surprised\nto see Rustum Khan, after a talk with Monty, return to his squadron\nand remain inactive under cover of the hill;  that fire-eater was\nthe last man one would expect to remain willingly out of action.\nHowever, twenty minutes later, Rustum Khan appeared beside me, breathing\nrather hard.  He begged the glasses of me, and spent five minutes\nstudying the firing-line minutely before returning them.\n\n\"The lord sahib has more faith in these undrilled folk than I have!\"\nhe grumbled at last.  \"Observe:  he goes with that bullet-food of\nmen and women mixed, to hide them in reserve behind the narrow gut\nat the head of the ramp.  The Turks are fools, as Kagig said, and\ntheir general is also a fool, in spite of Kagig.  They propose to\nforce that ramp.  You see that by Frredd sahib's orders the firing\non our side has grown greatly less.  That is to draw the Turks on.\nSee!  It has drawn them!  They are coming!  The lord sahib will send\nfor Frredd sahib to take command of that reserve, to man the top\nof the ramp in case the Turks succeed in climbing too far up it.\nThen he himself will gallop back to take charge of my squadron below\nthere;  and I take charge of his squadron up here.  He and I are\ninterchangeable, I having drilled all the men in any case--such\ndrilling as they have had--such little, little drilling!\"\n\nThe Turks began their advance into the jaws of that defile with a\nconfidence that made my heart turn cold.  What did they know?  What\nwere they depending on in addition to their weight of numbers?\nMahmoud Bey had evidently hurried up almost his whole division, and\nwas driving them forward into our trap as if he knew he could swallow\ntrap and all.  Not even foolish generals act that way.  It needs\na madman.  Kagig had said nothing about Mahmoud being mad.\n\n\"Listen, Rustum Khan!\" I said.  \"Go with a message to Lord Montdidier.\nTell him the whole Turkish force is in motion and coming on as if\ntheir general knows something for certain that we don't know at all.\nTell him that I suspect treachery at our rear, and have good reason\nfor it!\"\n\nRustum Khan eyed me for a minute as if he would read the very middle\nof my heart.\n\n\"Can you ride?\" he asked.\n\n\"Of course,\" I answered.  \"It's only walking that I can't do.\"\n\n\"Then leave those glasses with me, and go yourself!\"\n\n\"Why won't you go?\" I asked.\n\n\"Because here are fifty men who would lack a leader in that case.\"\n\nThe answer was honest enough, yet I had my qualms about leaving the\npost Monty had assigned to me.  The thought that finally decided\nme was that I would have opportunity to gallop past the hospital,\ntwo hundred yards over the bridge on the Zeitoon side, and make sure\nthat Gloria was safe.\n\n\"Have you seen Maga Jhaere anywhere?\" I asked.\n\n\"No,\" said the Rajput, swearing under his breath at the mere mention\nof her name.\n\n\"Then help me down from here.  I'll go.\"\n\nHe muttered to himself, and I think he thought I was off to make\nlove to the woman;  but I was past caring about any one's opinion\non that score.  Five minutes later I was trotting a good horse slowly\ndown the upper, steeper portion of the track toward Zeitoon, swearing\nto myself, and dreading the smoother going where I should feel compelled\nto gallop whether my ankle hurt or not.  As a matter of fact I began\nto suspect a broken bone or ligament, for the agonizing pain increased\nand made me sit awkwardly on the horse, thus causing him to change\nhis pace at odd intervals and give me more pain yet. However, gallop\nI had to, and I reached the bridge going at top speed, only to be\nforced to rein in, chattering with agony, by a man on foot who raced\nto reach the bridge ahead of me, and made unmistakable signals of\nhaving an important message to deliver.\n\nHe proved to be from Kagig, with orders to say that every man at\nhis disposal was engaged by a very strong body of Turks who had spent\nthe night creeping up close to their first objective, and had rushed\nit with the bayonet shortly after dawn.\n\n\"Order the women to stand ready by the bridge!\" were the last words\n(the man had the whole by heart), and then there was a scribbled\nnote from Will by way of make-weight.\n\n\"This end of the action looks pretty serious to me.  We're badly\noutnumbered.  The men are fighting gamely, but--tell Gloria for God's\nsake to look out after herself!\"\n\nI could hear no firing from that direction, for the great bulk of\nBeirut Dagh shut it off.\n\n\"How far away is the fighting?\" I demanded.\n\n\"Oh, a long way yet.\"\n\nI motioned to him to return to Kagig, and sent my horse across the\nbridge, catching sight of Gloria outside the hospital directly after\nI had crossed it.  She waved her hand to me;  so, seeing she was\nsafe for the present, I let the message to her wait and started\ndown the valley toward Monty as fast as the horse could go.  I had\nmy work cut out to drive him into the din of firing, for it was\nevidently his first experience of bursting shells, and even at\nhalf-a-mile distance he reared and plunged, driving me nearly crazy\nwith pain.  I found Monty shepherding the reserves he had brought\ndown, watching through glasses from over the top of the spur that\nformed the left-hand wall of the gut of the pass.\n\n\"I left Rustum Khan in my place,\" I began, expecting to be damned\nat once for absenting without leave.\n\n\"Glad you came,\" he said, without turning his head.\n\nI gave him my message, he listening while he watched the pass and\nthe oncoming enemy.\n\n\"I tried to warn you of treachery this morning!\" I said hotly.  Pain\nand memory did nothing toward keeping down choler.  \"Where's Peter\nMeasel?  Seen him anywhere?  Where's Maga Jhaere?  Seen her, either?\nThose Turks are coming on into what they must know is a trap, with\nthe confidence that proves their leaders have special information!\nLook at them!  They can see this pass is lined, with our riflemen,\nyet on they come!  They must suspect we've a surprise in store--yet\nlook at them!\"\n\nThey were coming on line after line, although Fred had turned the\nammunition loose, and the rifle-fire of our well-hidden men was\nplaying havoc.  Monty seemed to me to look more puzzled than afraid.\nI went on telling him of the message Kagig had sent, and offered him\nWill's note, but he did not even look at it.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said suddenly.  \"Now I understand!  Yes, it's treachery.\nI beg your pardon for my thoughts this morning.\"\n\n\"Granted,\" said I, \"but what next?\"\n\n\"Look!\" he said simply.\n\nThere were two sudden developments.  What was left of the first\nadvancing company of Turks halted below the ramp, and with sublime\neffrontery, born no doubt of knowledge that we had no artillery,\nproceeded to dig themselves a shallow trench.  The Zeitoonli were\nmaking splendid shooting, but it was only a question of minutes until\nthe shelter would be high enough for crouching men.\n\nThe second disturbing factor was that in a long line extending up\nthe flank of the mountain, roughly parallel to the lower end of the\ntrack that Monty had caused to be cut from the castle, the trees\nwere coming down as if struck by a cyclone!  There must have been\nmore than a regiment armed with axes, cutting a swath through the\nforest to take our secret road in flank!\n\nThat meant two things clearly.  Some one had told Mahmoud of our\nplan to charge down from the height and surprise him, thus robbing\nus of all the benefit of unexpectedness;  and, when the charge should\ntake place, our men would have to ride down four abreast through\nambush.  And, if Mahmoud had merely intended placing a few men to\ntrap our horsemen, he would never have troubled to cut down the\nforest.  Plainly, he meant to destroy our mounted men at point-blank\nrange, and then march a large force up the horse-track, so turning\nthe tables on us.  Considering the overwhelming numbers he had at\nhis disposal, the game to me looked almost over.\n\nNot so, however, to Monty.  He glanced over his shoulder once at\nthe men and women waiting for his orders, and I saw the women begin\ninspiriting their men.  Then he turned on me.\n\n\"Now damn your ankle,\" he said.  \"Try to forget it!  Climb up there\nand tell Fred to choose a hundred men and bring them down himself\nto oppose the enemy in front if he comes over the top of that ditch.\nThen you gallop back and get word to Rustum Khan to bring both squadrons\ndown here.  Tell him to stay by Fred and hold his horses until the\nlast minute.  Then you get all the women you can persuade to follow\nyou, and man the castle walls!  Hurry, now--that's all!\"\n\nThere was a man holding my horse.  I tied the horse securely to a\ntree instead, and told the man to help me climb, little suspecting\nwhat a Samson I had happened on.  He laughed, seized me in his arms,\nand proceeded to carry me like a baby up the goat-track leading to\nthe hidden rifle-pits and trenches.  I persuaded him to let me get\nup on his shoulders, and in that way I had a view of most of what\nwas happening.\n\nMonty led his men and women at a run across the top of the ramp\nflanked by the full fire of the entrenched company below;  and his\naction was so unexpected that the Turks fired like beginners.  There\nwere not many bodies lying quiet, nor writhing either when the last\nwoman had disappeared among the trees on the far side.  Those that\ndid writhe were very swiftly caused to cease by volleys aimed at\nthem in obedience to officers' orders.  It began to look as if Gloria's\nhospital would not be over-worked.\n\nThe tables were now turned on the Turks, except in regard to numbers.\nIn the first place, as soon as Monty's command had penetrated downward\nthrough the trees parallel with the side of the ramp, he had the\nentrenched company in flank.  It did not seem to me that he left\nmore than ten or fifteen men to make that trench untenable, but the\nTurks were out of it within five minutes and in full retreat under\na hot fire from Fred's men.\n\nThen Monty pushed on to the far side of the castle road and held\nthe remaining fringe of trees in such fashion that the Turks could\nnot guess his exact whereabouts nor what number he had with him.\nCutting down trees in a hurry is one thing, but cutting them down\nin face of hidden rifle-fire is most decidedly another, especially\nwhen the axmen have been promised there will be no reprisals.\n\nThe tree-felling suddenly ceased, and there began a close-quarters\nbattle in the woods, in which numbers had less effect than knowledge\nof the ground and bravery.  The Turk is a brave enough fighter, but\nnot to be compared with mountain-Armenians fighting for their home,\nand it was easy to judge which held the upper hand.\n\nI found Fred smoking his pipe and enjoying himself hugely, with half\na dozen runners ready to carry word to whichever section of the\ndefenses seemed to him to need counsel.  He could see what Monty\nhad done, and was in great spirits in consequence.\n\n\"I've bagged two Turk officers to my own gun,\" he announced.  \"Murder\nsuits me to a T.\"\n\nI gave him the message.\n\n\"Piffle!\" he answered.  \"They can never take the ramp by frontal\nattack!  The right thing to do is hold the flanks, and wither 'em\nas they cone!\"\n\n\"Monty's orders!\" I said, \"and I've got to be going.\"\n\n\"Damn that fellow Didums!\" he grumbled.  \"All right.  But it's my\nbelief he's turning a classy little engagement into a bloody brawl!\nCut along!  I'll pick my hundred and climb down there.\"\n\nCutting along was not so easy.  My magnificent human mount was hit\nby a bullet--a stray one, probably, shot at a hazard at long range.\nHe fell and threw me head-long;  and the agony of that experience\npretty nearly rendered me unconscious.  However, he was not hit badly,\nand essayed to pick me up again.  I refused that, but he held on\nto me and, both of us being hurt in the leg on the same side, we\nstaggered together down the goat-track.\n\nDown below we found the horse plunging in a frenzy of fear, and\nhe nearly succeeded in breaking away from both of us, dragging us\nout into full view of the enemy, who volleyed us at long range.\nFortunately they made rotten shooting, and one ill-directed hail\nof lead screamed on the far side, causing the horse to plunge toward\nme.  The Armenian took me by the uninjured foot and flung me into\nthe saddle, and I left up-pass with a parting volley scattering all\naround, and both hands locked into the horse's mane.  He needed\nneither whip nor spur, but went for Zeitoon like the devil with his\ntail on fire.\n\nI suppose one never grows really used to pain, but from use it becomes\nendurable.  When Anna ran out to stop me by the great rock on which\nthe lowest Zeitoon houses stand, and seized me by the foot, partly\nto show deference, partly in token that she was suppliant, and also\npartly because she was utterly distracted, I was able to rein the\nhorse and listen to her without swearing.\n\n\"She is gone!\" she shouted.  \"Gone, I tell you!  Gloria is gone!\nSix men, they come and take her!  She is resisting, oh, so hard--and\nthey throw a sack over her--and she is gone, I tell you!  She is gone!\"\n\n\"Where is Maga?\"\n\n\"Gone, too!\"\n\n\"In which direction did they take Miss Gloria?\"\n\n\"I do not know!\"\n\nI rode on.  There were crowds of women near the bridge, all armed\nwith rifles, and I hurried toward them.\n\nBut they refused to believe that any one in Zeitoon would do such\na thing as kidnap Gloria, and while I waited for Anna to come and\nconvince them a man forced himself toward me through the crowd.\nHe was out of breath.  One arm was in a bloody bandage, but in the\nother hand he held a stained and crumpled letter.\n\nIt proved to be from Will, addressed to all or any of us.\n\n      \"Kagig is a wonder!\" it ran, \"He has put new life into these\n      men and we've thrashed the Turk soundly.  How's Gloria?  Kagig\n      says, 'Can you send us       reenforcements?'  If so we can follow\n      up and do some real damage.  Send 'em quick!  Make Gloria\n      keep cover!                WILL.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twenty\n\"So few against so many!  I see death, and I am not sorry!\"\n\n\nTHOU LAND OF THE GLAD HAND\n\nThou land of the Glad Hand, whose frequent boast\nIs of the hordes to whom thou playest host!\nWhose liberty is full!  whose standard high\nHas reached and taken stars from out the sky!\nWhose fair-faced women tread the streets unveiled,\nUnchallenged, unaffronted, unassailed!\nWhose little ones in park and meadow laugh,\nNor know what cost that precious cup they quaff,\nNor pay in stripes and bruises and regret\nTen times each total of a parent's debt!\nThou nation born in freedom--land of kings\nWhose laws protect the very feathered things,\nUplifting last and least to high estate\nThat none be overlooked--and none too great!\nIs all thy freedom good for thee alone?\nIs earth thy footstool?   Are the clouds thy throne?\nShall other peoples reach thy hand to take\nThat gladdens only thee for thine own sake?\n\n\nTo get word to Rustum Khan was simple enough, for he himself came\nriding down to get news.  The minute he learned what Monty wanted\nof him he turned his horse back up-hill at a steady lope, and I began\non the next item in the program.\n\nNor was that difficult.  The reading aloud of Will's letter, translated\nto them by Anna, convinced the women that their beloved bridge was\nin no immediate danger, and no less than three hundred of them marched\noff to reenforce Kagig's men behind Beirut Dagh.  I reckoned that\nby the time they reached the scene of action we would have a few\nmore than three thousand men and women in the field under arms--against\nMahmoud Bey's thirty thousand Turks!\n\nThere remained to scrape together as many as possible to man the\ncastle walls;  and what with wounded, and middle-aged women, and\nmen whose weapons did not fit the plundered Turkish ammunition, I\nhad more than a hundred volunteers in no time.  The only disturbing\nfeature about this new command of mine was that it contained more\nthan a sprinkling of the type of malcontents who had bearded Kagig\nin his den the night before.  Those looked like thoroughly excellent\nfighting men, if only they could have been persuaded to agree to\ntrust a common leader.\n\nNot one of them but knew a thousand times more of Zeitoon, and their\npeople, and the various needs of defense than, for instance, I did.\nYet they clustered about me for lack of confidence in one another,\nand shouted after the women who marched away advice to watch lest\nKagig betray them all.  Not for nothing had the unspeakable Turk\ninculcated theories of misrule all down the centuries!\n\nI led them up to the castle, they carrying with them food enough\nfor several days.  We passed Rustum Khan coming down with the horsemen,\nand I fell behind to have word with him.\n\n\"Which of these men shall I pick to command the rest?\" I asked him.\n\"You've more experience of them.\"\n\n\"Any that you choose will be pounced on by the rest as wolves devour\na sheep!\" the Rajput answered.\n\n\"Should I have them vote on it?\"\n\n\"They would elect you,\" he answered.\n\n\"I've got to be free to look for Miss Gloria.  She's\nkidnapped--disappeared utterly!\"\n\nRustum Khan swore under his breath, using a language that I knew\nno word of.\n\n\"A woman again, and more trouble!\" he said at last grimly.  \"Let\nlike cure like then!  Choose a woman herdsman!\" he grinned.  \"It\nmay be she will surprise them into obedience!\"\n\n\"I'll take your advice,\" said I, although I resented his insinuation\nthat they were a herd--so swiftly does command make partisans.\n\n\"The last thing you may take from me, sahib!\" he answered.\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"So few against so many!  I see death and I am not sorry.  Only may\nI die leading those good mountain-men of mine!\"\n\nIt was part and parcel of him to praise those he had drilled and\nscorn the others.  I shook hands and said nothing.  It did not seem\nmy place to contradict him.\n\n\"Let us hope these people are the gainers by our finish!\" he called\nover his shoulder, riding on after his command.  \"They are not at\nall bad people--only un-drilled, and a little too used to the ways\nof the Turk!  Good-by, sahib!\"\n\nWithin the castle gate I found a woman, whom they all addressed as\nMarie, very busy sorting out the bundles they had thrown against\nthe wall.  She was putting all the food together into a common fund,\nand as I entered she shouted to her own nominees among the other\nwomen to get their cooking pots and begin business.\n\nStill pondering Rustum Khan's advice, in the dark whether or not\nbe meant it seriously, I chose Marie Chandrian to take command.\nShe made no bones about it, but accepted with a great shrill laugh\nthat the rest of them seemed to recognize--and to respect for old\nacquaintance' sake.  She turned out to have her husband with her--an\nenormous, hairy man with a bull's voice who ought to have been in\none or other of the firing-lines but had probably held back in obedience\nto his better half.  She made him her orderly at once, and it was\nnot long before every soul in the castle had his or her place to hold.\n\nThen I mounted once more and rode at top speed down the new road\nthat Monty was defending, taking another horse this time, not so\ngood, but much less afraid of the din of battle.\n\nI found Monty scarcely fifty paces from the track, on the outside\nedge of the fringe of trees that the Turks had been unable to cut\ndown. There were numbers of wounded laid out on the track itself,\nwith none to carry them away;  and the Turks were keeping up a hot\nfire from behind the shelter of the felled trees and standing stumps.\nThe outside range was two hundred yards, and there were several platoons\nof the enemy who had crept up to within thirty or forty yards and\ncould not be dislodged.\n\nI pulled Monty backward, for he could not hear me, and he and I stood\nbehind two trees while I told him what I had done, shouting into\nhis ear.\n\n\"I've got to go and find Gloria!\" I said finally, and he frowned,\nand nodded.\n\n\"Go first and take a look at the ramp through the trees.  Tell me\nwhat's happening.\"\n\nSo I limped down to the end of the track and made my way cautiously\nthrough the lower fringe of trees that had been cut three-parts through\nin readiness for felling in a hurry.  Just as I got there the Turks\nbegan a new massed advance up the ramp, as if in direct proof of\nMonty's mental alertness.\n\nThe men posted on the opposite flank to where I was opened a terrific\nfire that would have made poor Kagig bite his lips in fear for the\nwaning ammunition.  Then Fred came into action with his hundred,\nthrowing them in line into the open along the top, where they lay\ndown to squander cartridges--squandering to some purpose, however,\nfor the Turkish lines checked and reeled.\n\nBut Mahmoud Bey had evidently given orders that this advance should\nbe pressed home, and the Turks came on, company after company, in\nsucceeding waves of men.  There were some in front with picks and\nshovels, making rough steps in the slippery clay;  and I groaned,\nhating to go and tell Monty that it was only a matter of minutes\nbefore the frontal attack must succeed and the pass be in enemy hands.\n\n\"Here goes Armenia's last chance!\" I thought;  and I waited to see\nthe beginning of the end before limping back to Monty.\n\nAnd it was well I did wait.  I had actually forgotten Rustum Khan\nand his two squadrons.  Nor would I ever have believed without seeing\nit that one lone man could so inspirit and control that number of\naliens whom he had only as much as drilled a time or two.  It said\nas much for the Zeitoonli as for Rustum Khan.  Without the very\nultimate of bravery, good faith, and intelligence on their part he\ncould never have come near attempting what he did.\n\nHe brought his two squadrons in line together suddenly over the brow\nof the ramp, galloped them forward between Fred's extended riflemen,\nand charged down-hill, the horses checking as they felt the slippery\nclay under foot and then, unable to pull up, careering head-long,\nurged by their riders into madder and madder speed, with Rustum Khan\non his beautiful bay mare several lengths in the lead.\n\nCavalry usually starts at a walk, then trots, and only gains its\ngreat momentum within a few yards of the enemy.  This cavalry started\nat top speed, and never lost it until it buried itself into the\nadvancing Turks as an avalanche bursts into a forest!  No human enemy\ncould ever have withstood that charge.  Many of the horses fell in\nthe first fifty yards, and none of these were able to regain their\nfeet in time to be of use.  Some of the riders were rolled on and\nkilled.  And some were slain by the half-dozen volleys the astonished\nTurks found time to greet them with.  But more than two-thirds of\nRustum Khan's men, armed with swords of every imaginable shape and\nweight, swept voiceless into an enemy that could not get out of their\nway;  and regiments in the rear that never felt the shock turned\nand bolted from the wrath in front of them.\n\nI climbed out to the edge of the trees, and yelled for Fred, waving\nboth arms and my hat and a branch.  He saw me at last, and brought\nhis hundred men down the ramp at a run.\n\n\"Join Monty,\" I shouted, \"and help him clear the woods.\"\n\nHe led his men into the trees like a pack of hounds in full cry,\nand I limped after them, arriving breathless in time to see the Turks\nin front of Monty in full retreat, fearful because the Rajput's\ncavalry had turned their flank.  Then Monty and Fred got their men\ntogether and swung them down into the pass to cover Rustum Khan's\nretreat when the charge should have spent itself.\n\nThe Rajput had managed to demoralize the Turkish infantry, but Mahmoud's\nguns were in the rear, far out of reach.  Bursting shells did more\ndestruction as he shepherded the squadrons back again than bullet,\nbayonet and slippery clay combined to do in the actual charge itself.\nMonty gave orders to throw down the fringe of trees and let them\nthrough to the castle road, so saving them from the total annihilation\nin store if they had essayed to scramble up the slippery ramp.  And\nthen Fred's men joined Monty's contingent, helping them fortify the\nnew line--deepening and reversing the trench the Turks had dug below\nthe ramp, and continuing that line along through the remaining edge\nof trees that still stood between the enemy and the castle road.\n\nBut by cutting down the fringe at the end of the road to let Rustum\nKhan through we had forfeited the last degree of secrecy.  If the\nTurks could come again and force the gut of the pass, nothing but\nthe hardest imaginable fighting could prevent them from swinging\nround at that point and making use of our handiwork.\n\n\"That castle has become a weakness, not a strength, Colonel sahib!\"\nsaid Rustum Khan, striding through the trees to where Monty and Fred\nand I were standing.  \"I have lost seven and thirty splendid men,\nand three and forty horses.  One more such charge, and--\"\n\n\"No, Rustum Khan.  Not again,\" Monty answered.\n\n\"What else?\" laughed the Rajput.  \"That castle divides our forces,\nmaking for weakness.  If only--\"\n\n\"We must turn it to advantage, then, Rustum Khan!\"\n\n\"Ah, sahib!  So speaks a soldier!  How then?\"\n\n\"Mahmoud knows by now that the trees are down,\" said I.  \"His watchers\nmust have seen them fall.  Some of the trees are lying outward toward\nthe ramp.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Monty.  \"His own inclination will lead him to use\nour new road, and we must see that he does exactly that.  The guns\nare making the ramp too hot just now for amusement, but let some\none--you, Fred--run a deep ditch across the top of the ramp;  and\nif we can hold them until dark we'll have connected ditches dug at\nintervals all the way down.\"\n\nLooking over the top of the trees I could just see the Montdidier\nstandard bellying in the wind.\n\n\"I'll bet you Mahmoud can see that, too!\" said I, drawing the others'\nattention to it.\n\n\"Let's hope so,\" Monty answered quietly.  \"Now, Rustum Khan, find\none of those brave horsemen of yours who is willing to be captured\nby the enemy and give some false information.  I want it well understood\nthat our only fear is of a night attack!\"\n\n\"You say, Colonel sahib, there will be no further use for cavalry?\"\n\n\"Not for a charge down that ramp, at any rate!\"\n\n\"Then send me!  My word will carry conviction. I can say that as\na Moslem I will fight no longer on the side of Christians.  They\nwill accept my information, and then hang me for having led a charge\ninto their infantry.  Send me, sahib!\"\n\nMonty shook his head.  Rustum Khan seemed inclined to insist, but\nthere came astonishing interruption.  Kagig appeared, with arms akimbo,\nin our midst.\n\n\"Oh, sportmen all!\" he laughed.  \"This day goes well!\"\n\n\"Thank God you're here!\" said Monty.  \"Now we can talk.\"\n\n\"That Will--what is his name?--Will Yerkees is a wonderful fighter!\"\nsaid Kagig, snapping his fingers and making the joints crack.\n\n\"He accuses you of that complaint,\" said I.\n\n\"Me?  No.  I am only enthusiast.  The road behind Beirut Dagh is\nrough and narrow.  The Turks had hard work, and less reason for\neagerness than we.  So we overcame them.  They have fallen back to\nwhere they were at dawn, and they are discouraged\"--he made his\nfinger-joints crack again--\"discouraged!  The women feel very confident.\nThe men feet exactly as the women do!  The Turks are preparing to\nbivouac where they lie.  They will attack no more to-day--I know them!\"\n\n\"Listen, Kagig!\"  Monty drew us all together with a gesture of both\nhands.  \"These Turks are too many for us, if we give them time.\nOur ammunition won't last, for one thing.  We must induce Mahmoud\nto attack to-night--coax him up this castle road, and catch him in\na trap.  It can be done.  It must be done!\"\n\n\"I know the right man to send to the Turk to tell him things!\" Kagig\nanswered slowly with relish.\n\n\"That is my business!\" growled Rustum Khan, but Kagig laughed at him.\n\n\"No Turk would believe a word you say--not one leetle word!\" he said,\nsnapping his fingers.  \"You are a good fighter.  I saw your charge\nfrom the castle tower;  it was very good.  But I will send an Armenian\non this errand.  Go on, Lord Monty;  I know the proper man.\"\n\n\"That's about the long and short of it,\" said Monty.  \"If we can\ninduce Mahmoud to attack to-night, we've a fair chance of hitting\nhim so hard that he'll withdraw and let us alone.  Otherwise--\"\n\nKagig's finger-joints cracked harder than ever as his quick mind\nreviewed the possibilities.\n\n\"Have you any idea what can have happened to Miss Vanderman?\" I\nasked him.\n\n\"Miss Vanderman?  No?  What?  Tell me!\"\n\nHe seemed astonished, and I told him slowly, lest he miss one grain\nof the enormity of Maga's crime.  But instead of appearing distressed\nhe shook his bands delightedly and rattled off a very volley of\ncracking knuckles.\n\n\"That is the idea!  We have Mahmoud caught!  I know Mahmoud!  I know\nhim!  The man I shall choose shall tell Mahmoud that Gloria Vanderman--the\nbeautiful American young lady, who is outlawed because of her\nfighting on behalf of Armenians--who--who could not possibly be claimed\nby the American consul, on account of being outlawed--is in the castle\nto-night and can be taken if he only will act quickly!  Oh, how his\neyes will glitter!  That Mahmoud--he buys women all the time!  A\nyoung--beautiful--athletic American girl--Mahmoud will sacrifice\nthree thousand men to capture her!\"\n\nMonty ground his teeth.  Fred turned his back, and filled his pipe.\nRustum Khan brushed his black beard upward with both hands.\n\n\"Suppose you go now and try to find Miss Vanderman,\" said Monty rather\ngrimly to me.  \"If you find her, hide her out of harm's way and\ncommunicate with Will!\"\n\nSo Fred helped me on the horse and I rode back to the castle, where\nI explained the details of the fighting below to the defenders, and\nthen rode on down to Zeitoon by the other road.  It was wearing along\ninto the afternoon, and I had no idea which way to take to look for\nGloria;  but I did have a notion that Maga Jhaere might be looking\nout for me.  There was a chance that she might have been in earnest\nin persuading me to elope, and that if I rode alone she might show\nherself--she or else Gloria's captors.\n\nFailing signs of Maga Jhaere or her men, I proposed to ride behind\nBeirut Dagh in search of Will, and to get his quick Yankee wit employed\non the situation.\n\nSo, instead of crossing the bridge into Zeitoon I guided my horse\naround the base of the mountain, riding slowly so as to ease the\npain in my foot and to give plenty of opportunity to any one lying\nin wait to waylay me.\n\nIt happened I guessed rightly.  The track swung sharp to the left\nafter a while, and passed up-hill through a gorge between two cliffs\ninto wilder country than any I had yet seen in Armenia.  From the\ntop of the cliff on the right-hand side a pebble was dropped and\nstruck the horse--then another--then a third one.  I thought it best\nto take no notice of that, although the horse made fuss enough.\n\nThe third pebble was followed by a shrill whistle, which I also decided\nto ignore, and continued to ride on toward where a clump of scrawny\nbushes marked the opening out of a narrow valley.  I heard the bushes\nrustle as I drew near them, and was not surprised to see Maga emerge,\nlooking hot, impatient and angry, although not less beautiful on\nthat account.\n\n\"Fool!\" she began on me.  \"Why you wait so long?  Another half-hour\nand it is too late altogether!  Come now!  Leave the horse.  Come quick!\"\n\nWondering what important difference half an hour should make, it\noccurred to me that Will was probably impatient long ago at receiving\nno news of Gloria.  If I judged Will rightly, he would be on his\nway to look for her.\n\n\"Come quick!\" commanded Maga.\n\n\"I can't climb that cliff,\" said I.  \"I've hurt my foot.\"\n\n\"I help you. Come!\"\n\nShe stepped up close beside me to help me down, but that instant\nit seemed to me that I heard more than one horse approaching.\n\n\"Quick!\" she commanded, for she heard them, too, and held out her\narms to help me.  \"Quick! I have two men to help you walk!\"\n\nI could have reached my pistol, but so could she have reached hers,\nand her hand and eye were quicker than forked lightning.  Besides,\nto shoot her would have been of doubtful benefit until Gloria's\nwhereabouts were first ascertained.  She put an arm round me to pull\nme from the saddle, and that settled it.  I fell on her with all\nmy weight, throwing her backward into the bushes, and kicking the\nhorse in the ribs with my uninjured foot.  The horse took fright\nas I intended, and went galloping off in the direction of the\napproaching sounds.\n\nI had not wrestled since I was a boy at school, and then never with\nsuch a spitting puzzle of live wires as Maga proved herself.  I had\nthe advantage of weight, but I had told her of my injured foot, and\nshe worked like a she-devil to damage it further, fighting at the\nsame time with left and right wrist alternately to reach pistol\nand knife.\n\nI let go one wrist, snatched the pistol out of her bosom and threw\nit far away.  But with the free and she reached her knife, and landed\nwith it into my ribs.  The pain of the stab sickened me;  but the\nknowledge that she had landed fooled her into relaxing her hold in\norder to jump clear.  So I got hold of both wrists again, and we\nrolled over and over among the bushes, she trying like an eel to wriggle\naway, and I doing my utmost to crush the strength out of her.  We\nwere interrupted by Will's voice, and by Will's strong arms dragging\nus apart.\n\n\"Catch her!\" I panted.  \"Hold her! Don't let her go!\"\n\n\"Never fear!\" he laughed.\n\n\"Her men have kidnapped Gloria!  Tie her hands!\"\n\nWill had two men with him, one of whom was leading my runaway horse.\nThey gazed open-eyed while Will tied Maga's wrists behind her back.\n\n\"Kagig--what will he say?\" one of them objected, but Will laughed.\n\n\"What you do with me?\" demanded Maga.\n\n\"Take you to Kagig, of course.  Where's Miss Vanderman?\"\n\nThen suddenly Maga's whole appearance changed.  The defiance vanished,\nleaving her as if by magic supple again, subtle, suppliant, conjuring\nback to memory the nights when she had danced and sung.  The fire\ndeparted from her eyes and they became wet jewels of humility with\nsoft love lights glowing in their depths.\n\n\"You do not want that woman!\" she said slowly, smiling at Will.\n\"You give 'er to this fool!\"  She glanced at my bleeding ribs, as\nif the blood were evidence of folly.  \"You take me, Will Yerkees!\nThen I teach you all things--all about people--all about land, and\nlove, and animals, and water, and the air--I teach you all!\"\n\nShe paused a moment, watching his face, judging the effect of words.\nHe stood waiting with a look of puzzled distress that betrayed regret\nfor her tied wrists, but accepted the necessity.  Perhaps she mistook\nthe chivalrous distress for tenderness.\n\n\"I 'ave tried to make that man Kagig king!  I 'ave tried, and tried!\nBut 'e is no good!  If 'e 'ad obeyed me, I would 'ave made 'im king\nof all Armenia! But 'e is as good as dead already, because Mahmoud\nthe Turk is come to finish 'im--so!\"  She spat conclusively.  \"So\nnow I make you king instead of 'im!  You let that Gloria Vanderman\ngo to this fool, an' I show you 'ow to make all Armenians follow\nyou an' overthrow the Turks, an' conquer, an' you be king!\"\n\nWill laughed.  \"Better stick to Kagig!  I'm going to take you to him!\"\n\n\"You take me to 'im?\"\n\nShe flashed again, swift as a snake to illustrate resentment.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then I tell 'im things about you, an' 'e believe me!\"\n\n\"Let's bargain,\" laughed Will.  \"Show me Miss Vanderman, alive and\nwell, and--\"\n\n\"Steady the Buffs!\" I warned him.  \"Gloria's not far away.  There\nwere pebbles dropped on my horse.  There may be a cave above this\ncliff--or something of the sort.\"\n\nWill nodded. \"--and I won't tell Kagig you made love to me!\"\nhe continued.\n\n\"Poof!  Pah!  Kagig, 'e know that long ago!\"\n\nWill turned to his two men and bade them tie the horses to a bush.\n\n\"How are the ribs?\" he asked me.\n\n\"Nothing serious,\" said I.\n\n\"Do you think you can watch her if I tie her feet?\"\n\n\"She's slippery and strong!  Better tie her to a tree as well!\"\n\nSo between them Will and the two men trussed her up like a chicken\nready for the market, making her bound ankles fast to the roots of\na bush.  Then he led the two men up the cliff-side, and Maga lay\nglaring at me as if she hoped hate could set me on fire, while I\nmade shift to stanch my wound.\n\nBut she changed her tactics almost before Will was out of sight beyond\na boulder, beginning to scream the same words over and over in the\ngipsy tongue and struggling to free her feet until I thought the\nthongs would either burst or strip the flesh from her.\n\nThe screams were answered by a shout from up above.  Then I heard\nWill shout, and some one fired a pistol.  There came a clatter of\nloose stones, and I got to my feet to be ready for action--not that\nmy hurts would have let me accomplish much.\n\nA second later I saw three of Gregor Jhaere's gipsies scurrying along\nthe cliff-side, turning at intervals to fire pistols at some one\nin pursuit.  So I joined in the fray with my Colt repeater, and\nflattered myself I did not do so badly.  The first two shots produced\nno other effect than to bring the runaways to a halt.  The next three\nshots brought all three men tumbling head over heels down the\ncliff-side, rolling and sliding and scattering the stones.\n\nOne fell near Maga's feet and lay there writhing.  The other two\ncame to a standstill in a hideous heap beside me, and I stooped to\nsee if I could recognize them.\n\nWhat happened after that was almost too quick for the senses to take\nin.  One of the gipsies came suddenly to life and seized me by the\nneck.  The other grasped my feet, and as I fell I saw the third man\nslash loose Maga's thongs and help her up.\n\nMy two assailants rolled me over on my back, and while one held me\nthe other aimed blows at my head with the butt of his empty pistol.\nOnce he hit me, and it felt like an explosion.  Twice by a miracle\nI dodged the blows, growing weaker, though, and hopeless.  He aimed\na fourth blow, taking his time about it and making sure of his aim,\nand I waited in the nearest approach to fatalistic calm I ever\nexperienced.\n\nIn a strange abstraction, in which every movement seemed to be\nslowed down into unbelievable leisureliness, I saw the butt of the\npistol begin to approach my eye--near--nearer.  Then suddenly I heard\na woman scream, and a shot ring out.\n\nInstead of the pistol butt the gipsy's brains splashed on my face,\nand the man collapsed on top of me.  Next I realized that Gloria\nVanderman was wiping my face with a cloth of some kind, holding a\nhot pistol in her other hand, while Will was standing laughing over\nme, and Maga Jhaere with the other gipsy had disappeared altogether.\n\n\"Did you shoot Maga?\" I mumbled.\n\n\"No,\" Will laughed.  \"I'd hate to shoot a woman who'd offered to\nmake me king!  She ought to be hung, though, for a horse-thief!\nShe and that other gipsy got away with the mounts!  Never mind--there\nare four of us to carry you, if Gloria lends a hand!\"\n\nBut I have no notion how they carried me.  All I remember is recovering\nconsciousness that evening in the castle, to discover myself copiously\nbandaged, and painfully stiff, but not so much of an invalid after all.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twenty-one\n\"Those who survive this night shall have brave memories!\"\n\n\nFRAGMENT\n\nOh, fear and hate shall have their spate\n(For both of the twain are one)\nAnd lust and greed devour the seed\nThat else had growth begun.\nFiercely the flow of death shall go\nAnd short the good man's shrift!\nAll hell's awake full toll to take,\nAnd passions hour is swift.\n\nBut there be cracks in evil's tracks\nWhere seed shall safe abide,\nAnd living rocks shall breast the shocks\nOf overflowing tide.\nCastle and wall and keep shall fall,\nProphet and plan shall fail,\nAnd they shall thank nor wit nor rank\nWho in the end prevail.\n\n\nLooking back after this lapse of time there seems little difference\nbetween the disordered dreams of unconsciousness and the actual\nwaking turmoil of that night. At first as I came slowly to my senses\nthere seemed only a sea of voices all about me, and a constant thumping,\nas of falling weights.\n\nThere were great pine torches set in the rusty old rings on the wall,\nand by their fitful light I saw that I lay on a cot in the castle keep.\nMonty, Fred, Will, Kagig and Rustum Khan were conversing at a table.\nGloria sat on an up-ended pine log near me.  A dozen Armenians,\nincluding the \"elders\" who had disagreed with Kagig, stood arguing\nrather noisily near the door.\n\n\"What is the thumping?\" I asked, and Gloria hurried to the cot-side.\nBut I managed to sit up, and after she had given me a drink I found\nthat my foot was still the most injured part of me.  It was swollen\nunbelievably, whereas my bandaged head felt little the worse for\nwear, and the knife-wound did not hurt much.\n\n\"They're bringing in wood,\" she answered.\n\n\"Why all that quantity?\"\n\nThe thumping was continuous, not unlike the noise good stevedores\nmake when loading against time.\n\n\"To burn the castle!\"\n\nAt that moment Rustum Khan left the table, and seeing me sitting\nup strode over.\n\n\"Good-by, sahib!\" he said, reaching out for my hand.\n\n\"The lord sahib has given me a post of honor and I go to hold it.\nThose who survive this night shall have brave memories!\"\n\nI got to my feet to shake hands with him, and I think he appreciated\nthe courtesy, for his stern eyes softened for a moment.  He saluted\nGloria rather perfunctorily as became his attitude toward women,\nand strode away to a point half-way between the door and Monty.\nThere he turned, facing the table.\n\n\"Lord sahib bahadur!\" he said sonorously.\n\nMonty got up and stood facing him.\n\n\"Salaam!\"\n\n\"Salaam, Rustum Khan!\" Monty answered, returning the salute, and\nthe others got to their feet in a hurry, and stood at attention.\n\nThen the Rajput faced about and went striding through the doorless\nopening into the black night--the last I was destined to see of\nhim alive.\n\n\"May we all prove as faithful and brave as that man!\" said Monty,\nsitting down again, and Kagig cracked his knuckles.\n\nGloria and I went over and sat at the table, and seeing me in a state\nto understand things Monty gave me a precis of the situation.\n\n\"We're making a great beacon of this castle,\" he said. \"Three hundred\nmen and women are piling in the felled logs and trees and\ndown-wood--everything that will burn.  We shall need light on the scene.\nRustum Khan has gone to hold the clay ramp and make sure the Turks\nturn up this castle road.  Fred is to hold the corner;  we've fortified\nthe Zeitoon side of the road, and Fred and his men are to make sure\nthe Turks don't spread out through the trees.  Kagig, Will and I,\nwith twenty-five very carefully picked men for each of us, wait for\nthe Turks at the bottom of the road and put up a feint of resistance.\nOur business will be to make it look as little like a trap and as\nmuch like a desperate defense as possible.  We hope to make it seem\nwe're caught napping and fighting in the last ditch.\"\n\n\"Last ditch is true enough!\" Fred commented cheerfully.  Fred was\nobviously in his best humor, faced by a situation that needed no\ncynicism to discolor it--full of fight and perfectly contented.\n\n\"Practically all of the rest of the men and women who are not watching\nthe enemy on the other side of Beirut Dagh,\" Monty went on, \"are\nhidden, or will be hidden in the timber on either side of the road.\nWe're hoping to God they'll have sense enough to keep silent until\nthe beacon is lighted.  You're to light the beacon, since you're\nrecovering so finely--you and Miss Vanderman.\"\n\n\"Yes, but when?\" said I.\n\n\"When the bugles blow.  We've got six bugles--\"\n\n\"Only two of them are cornets and one's a trombone,\" Fred put in.\n\n\"And when they all sound together, then set the castle alight and\nkill any one you see who isn't an Armenian!\"\n\n\"Or us!\" said Fred.  \"You're asked not to kill one of us!\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact,\" said Monty,  \"I rather expect to be near you\nby that time, because we don't want to give the signal until as many\nTurks as possible are caught in the road like rats.  At the signal\nwe dose the road at both ends;  Rustum Khan and Fred from the bottom\nend, and we at the top.\"\n\n\"Most of the murder,\" Fred explained cheerfully, \"will be done by\nthe women hidden in the trees on either flank.  As long as they don't\nshoot across the road and kill one another it'll be a picnic!\"\n\n\"How do you know the Turks will walk into the trap?\" I asked.\n\n\"Ten 'traitors,'\" said Monty, \"have let themselves get caught at\nintervals since noon.  One of Kagig's spies has got across to us\nwith news that Mahmoud means to finish the hash of Zeitoon to-night.\nHis men have been promised all the loot and all the women.\"\n\n\"Except one!\" Fred added with a glance at Gloria.\n\n\"Two!  Except two!\" remarked Kagig with a glance at the door.  We\nlooked, and held our breath.\n\nMaga Jhaere stood there, with a hand on the masonry on each side!\n\n\"You fool, Kagig, what you fill this castle full of wood for?\"\nshe demanded.\n\nKagig beckoned to her.\n\n\"To burn little traitoresses!\" he answered tenderly.  \"Come here!\"\n\nShe walked over to him, and he put his arm around her waist, looking\nup from his seat into her face as if studying it almost for the\nfirst time.  She began running her fingers through his hair.\n\n\"Is she not beautiful?\" he asked us naively.  Then, not waiting for\nan answer:  \"She is my wife, effendim.  You would not have me be\nrevengeful--not toward my wife, I think?\"\n\n\"Your wife?  Why didn't you tell us that before?\"\n\nGloria seemed the most surprised, as well as the most amused, although\nwe were all astonished.\n\n\"Not tell you before?  Oh--do you remember Abraham--in the Bible--yes?\nShe has been my best spy now and then.  As Kagig's wife what good\nwould she be?\"  Yet, had I not married her, I should have lost the\nservices of most of my best spies--Gregor Jhaere for one.  He is\nnot her father, no.  They call her their queen.  She is daughter\nof another gipsy and of an Armenian lady of very good family.  She\nhas always hoped to see me a monarch!\"\n\nHe laughed, and cracked his finger-joints.\n\n\"To make of me a monarch, and to reign beside me!  Ha-ha-ha!  I did\nthose gipsies a favor by marrying her, for she was something of a\nproblem to them, no gipsy being good enough in her eyes, and no busne\n(Gentile) caring for the honor until I saw and fell in love!  Oh,\nyes, I fell in love!  I, Kagig, the old adventurer, I fell in love!\"\n\nHe drew her down and kissed her as tenderly as if she were a little\nchild;  then rose to his feet.\n\n\"You forgive her, effendim?\" he asked.  \"You forgive her for my sake?\"\n\nNone answered him.  Perhaps he asked too much.\n\n\"Never mind me, then, effendim.  Not for my sake, but for the good\nwork she has so often done, and for the work she shall do--you\nforgive her?\"\n\nWe all looked toward Gloria.  It was her prerogative.  Gloria took\nMaga's left hand in her right.\n\n\"I don't blame you,\" she said, \"for coveting Will.  I've coveted\nhim myself!  But you needn't have let your men handle me so roughly!\"\n\n\"No?\" said Maga blandly.  \"Then why did you 'urt two of them so badly\nthat they run away?  Did not you shoot that other one?  So--I give\n'im to you.  I give you that Will Yerkees--\"\n\n\"Thanks!\" put in Will, but Maga ignored the interruption.\n\n\"--not because you are cleverer than me--or more beautiful.  You\nare uglee!  You can not dance, and as for fighting, I could keel\nyou with one 'and!  But because I like Kagig better after all!\"\n\nAt that Kagig suddenly dismissed all such trivialities as treachery\nand matrimony from his mind with one of his Napoleonic gestures.\n\n\"It is time, effendim, to be moving!\"  He led the way out without\nanother word, I limping along last and the Armenian \"elders\"\nfollowing me.\n\nIt was pitchy dark in the castle courtyard, and without the light\nfrom numerous kerosene lanterns it would not have been possible to\nfind the way between the heaped-up logs.  There was only a crooked,\nvery narrow passage left between the keep and the outer gate, and\nthey had long ago left off using the gate for the lumber, but were\nhoisting it over the wall with ropes.  One improvised derrick squealed\nin the darkness, and the logs came in by twos and tens and dozens.\nNo sooner were we out of the keep than women came and tossed in logs\nthrough the door and windows, until presently that building, too,\ncontained fuel enough to decompose the stone.  And over the whole\nof it, here, there and everywhere, men were pouring cans and cans\nof kerosene, while other men were setting dry tinder in\nstrategic places.\n\nThere was no moon that night.  Or if there was a moon, then the\ndark clouds hid it.  No doubt Mahmoud thought he had a night after\nhis own heart for the purpose of overwhelming our little force;\nfor how should he know that we were ready for the massed battalions\nforming to storm the gorge again.  At a little after eight o'clock\nMahmoud resumed the offensive with his artillery, and a messenger\nthat Monty sent down to watch returned and reported the shells all\nbursting wild, with Rustum Khan's men taking careful cover in the\nditches they had zigzagged down the whole face of the ramp.\n\nAn hour later the Turk's infantry was reported moving, and shortly\nbefore ten o'clock we heard the opening rattle of Rustum Khan's\nstinging defense.  There was intended to be no deception about that\npart of our arrangements;  nor was there.  The oncoming enemy was\nmet with a hail of destruction that checked and withered his ranks,\nand made the succeeding companies only too willing to turn at the\ncastle road instead of struggling straight forward.\n\nNor was the turn accomplished without further loss;  for our Zeitoonli,\nstill entrenched on the flank of the pass, loosed a murderous storm\nof lead through the dark that swept every inch of the open castle\nroad, and the turn became a shambles.\n\nBut Mahmoud had reckoned the cost and decided to pay it.  Company\nafter company poured up the gorge in the rear of the front ones,\nand turned with a roar up the road, butchered and bewildered, but\never adding to the total that gained shelter beyond the first turn\nin the road.\n\nThose, however, had to deal at once with Monty, Will and Kagig, who\nopened on them guerrilla warfare from behind trees--never opposing\nthem sufficiently to check them altogether, but leading them steadily\nforward into the two-mile trap.  From where I stood on the top of\nthe castle wall I could judge pretty accurately how the fight went;\nand I marveled at the skill of our men that they should retire up\nthe road so slowly, and make such a perfect impression of desperate\ndefense.  Gloria refused from the first to remain inactive beside\nme, but went through the trees down the line of the road, crossing\nat intervals from side to side, urging and begging our ambushed\npeople to be patient and reserve their fire until the chorus of bugles\nshould blow.\n\nAbout eleven o'clock a breathless messenger came to say that the\nTurks had renewed the attack on the other side of Beirut Dagh;  but\nI did not even send him on to Kagig.  If the attack was a feint,\nas was probable, intended to distract us from the main battle, then\nthere were men enough there to deal with it.  If, on the other hand,\nMahmoud had divided forces and sent a formidable number around the\nmountain, then our only chance was nevertheless to concentrate on\nour great effort, and defeat the nearest first.  There was not the\nslightest wisdom in sending down a message likely to distract Monty\nor Will or Kagig from their immediate task.\n\nThe women kept piling in the pine trees, until I thought the very\nweight of lumber might defeat our purpose by delaying the blaze too\nlong.  But Kagig had requisitioned every drop of kerosene in Zeitoon,\nand the stuff was splashed on with the recklessness that comes of\nthrowing parsimony to the winds.  Then I grew afraid lest they should\nfire the stuff too soon, or lest some stray spark from a man's pipe\nor an overturned lantern should do the work.  Every imaginable fear\npresented itself, because, having no active part in the fighting,\nI had nothing to distract me from self-criticism.  It became almost\na foregone conclusion after a while that the night's work was destined\nto be spoiled entirely by some oversight or stupidity of mine.\n\nThe battle down in the valley dinned and screamed like the end of\nthe world, although the Turks could not use their artillery for\nfear of slaughtering their own men.  I could hear Fred hotly engaged,\nholding the corner of the turn where the Turks were seeking in vain\nto widen it.  Probably the Turks supposed he was put there with a\nhundred men to defend the road, instead of to drive their thinned\nbattalions up it.\n\nIn the end it was an accident that set the bugles blowing, and probably\nthat accident saved our fortunes.  Monty shouted to a man to run\nand ask for news of the fighting below.  Mistaking the words in the\ndin, the messenger ran to the rock in the clearing on which the\nmusicians waited, and a minute later the first bars of the Marseillaise\nrang clearly through the trees.\n\nThe almost instant answer was a volley from each side of the road\nthat sounded like the explosion of the whole world.  And the Turks\nhardly half into the trap yet!  Monty and Will and Kagig brought\ntheir men back up the road at the double, as the only way to escape\nthe fire of our ambushed friends.  I was two minutes fumbling with\nmatches in the wind before I could light the kindling set ready in\nthe entrance arch;  and it was about three minutes more before the\nfirst long flame shot skyward and the beacon we had set began to\ndo its appointed work.\n\nThen, though, that castle proved to be a very Vesuvius, for the\ndraught poured in through the doorless arch and hurried the hot\nflames skyward to be mushroomed roaring against the belly of black\nclouds.  None of us knew then where Mahmoud was, nor that he had\ngiven the order that minute to his trapped battalions to halt, face\nthe trees on either side, and advance in either direction in order\nto widen their front.\n\nThe firing of the castle, for some mad reason of the sort that mothers\nevery catastrophe, caused them to disobey that order and, instead,\nto charge forward at the double.  In a moment the new fury (for it\nwas not panic, nor yet exactly the reverse) communicated itself all\nalong the road, and the regiments at the rear, in spite of the murderous\nfire from our ambush, yelled and milled to drive the men in front\nmore swiftly.\n\nThen Fred saw the castle flames, and led his men forward to plug\nup the lower end of the road.  Next Rustum Khan saw it, and advanced\nthree hundred down the ramp to hold the ditch at the bottom and prevent\nreserves from coming to the rescue.\n\nIt was then, so he told us afterward, that Fred realized who was\nthe person in authority who had sought to change the line of battle\nat the critical moment.  Mahmoud himself, surrounded by his staff,\nhad ridden forward to see what the true nature of the difficulty\nmight be, and had got caught in the trap when Fred closed it and\nRustum Khan cut off the flow of men!\n\nFred did his best by rapid fire to put an end to Mahmoud, staff and\nall.  But the light from the castle did not reach down in among the\ntrees, and when he told the nearest men who the target was that only\nmade the shooting wilder. Nor was Mahmoud a man without decision.\nRealizing that he was trapped, at any rate from behind, he galloped\nforward with his staff, scattering bewildered men to right and left\nof him, to find out whether the trap could not be forced from the\nupper end, knowing that there were plenty of men on the road already\nto account for any possible total we could bring against them, if\nonly they could be led forward and deployed.\n\nSo it came about that Mahmoud on a splendid war-horse, and five of\nhis mounted staff, arrived at the head of the oncoming column;  and\nKagig saw them in a moment when the flare from the castle roared\nlike a rocket hundreds of feet high and scattered all the shadows\non that section of the road.  Kagig passed the word along, but it\nwas Monty who devised the instant plan, and one of Will's men who\ncame running to find me.\n\nSo I forgot pain and disability in the excitement of having a part\nto play.  Gloria had found her way back to the castle, and it was\nshe who rallied all the men and women who had worked at piling fuel,\nand brought them to where I lay.  Then I begged her to get back\nsomewhere and hide, but she laughed at me.\n\nOur business was to burry down the road and plug it against Mahmoud\nand his men, while Kagig got behind him by sheer hand-to-hand fighting,\nand Monty and Will approached him from the flanks.  We had to be\ncautious about shooting, because of Kagig, for one thing, but for\nanother, Will had sent the message, \"Don't kill Mahmoud.\"  And that,\nof course, was obvious.  Mahmoud alive would be worth a thousand\nto us of any Mahmoud dead.\n\nGloria ran down the road beside me, and Will caught sight of her\nin the dancing light.  I heard him shout something in United States\nEnglish about women and hell-fire and burned fingers, but beyond\nthat it was not polite, and was intended for me as much as for Gloria,\nI did not get the gist of it.  Then the battle closed up around us,\nand we all fought hand to hand--women harder than the men--to close\nin on Mahmoud and drag him from his horse.\n\nThree times in the fitful dark and even more deceptive dancing light\nwe almost had him.  But the first time he fought free, and his\nwar-horse kicked a clear way for him for a few yards through the\nscrimmage.  Then Kagig closed in on him from the rear.  But three\nof the staff engaged Kagig alone, and twenty or thirty of Mahmoud's\ninfantry drove Kagig's men back on the still advancing column.  Kagig\nwent down, fighting and shouting like a Berserker, and Monty let\nMahmoud go to run to Kagig's rescue.\n\nMonty did not go alone, for his men leapt after him like hounds.\nBut he fought his way in the lead with a clubbed rifle, and stood\nover Kagig's body working the weapon like a flail.  That was all\nI saw of that encounter, for Mahmoud decided to attempt escape by\nthe upper way again, and it was I who captured him.  I landed on\nhim through the darkness with my clenched fist under the low hung\nangle of his jaw and, seizing his leg, threw him out of the saddle.\nThere Gloria helped me sit on him;  and the greater part of what\nwe had to do was to keep the women from tearing him to pieces.\n\nAt last Gloria and I, with a dozen of them, took Mahmoud up-hill\nand made him sit down in full firelight with his back against a\nrock.  He had nothing to say for himself, but stared at Gloria with\neyes that explained the whole philosophy of all the Turks;  and she,\nfor sake of the decency that was her birthright, went and stood on\nthe far side of the rock and kept the bulge of it between them.\n\nThen I sent for Kagig, and Monty, and Will;  And after they had seen\nto the barricading of the upper end of the road with fallen trees\nand a fairly wide ditch, Kagig and Will came, followed by half a\ndozen of the elders, who had been lending a stout hand during that\npart of the night's work.  Kagig was out of breath, but apparently\nnot hurt much.\n\nThey came so slowly that I wondered.  Gloria, who could see much\nfarther through the dark than I, gave a little scream and ran forward.\nI saw then by a sudden burst of flame from the castle that they were\ncarrying something heavy, and I guessed what it was although my heart\nrebelled against belief;  but I did not dare leave Mahmoud, who\nseemed inclined to take advantage of the first stray opportunity.\nI stuck my pistol into his ear and dared him to move hand or foot.\n\nGloria came back in tears, and took Mahmoud's cape and my jacket,\nand spread them on the ground.  On these they laid Monty very tenderly,\nKagig looking on with cracking finger-joints that I could hear quite\nplainly in spite of the awful rage of battle that thundered and\ncrashed and screamed among the woods.  It was as one sometimes hears\nthe ticking of a watch beneath the pillow in a nightmare.\n\nMonty was alive, but in spite of what Gloria could do the dark blood\nwas welling out from a sword gash on his right side, and we had not\na surgeon within miles of us.  From somewhere out of the darkness\nMaga appeared, bringing water, her face all black with the filth\nof fighting among trees, and her eyes on fire.\n\nMonty seemed to be listening to the noise of battle--Kagig to think\nof nothing but his loss.  He pointed at Mahmoud, who was eying Monty\ncuriously.\n\n\"See the prisoner!\" he said.  \"Ha!  I would give a hundred of him\na hundred times for Monty, my brother!\"\n\nMonty turned his head to see Mahmoud, and appeared partly satisfied.\n\n\"You hold the key,\" he said painfully.  \"Mahmoud will make terms.\nBut it will take time to stop the fighting.  You must send down\nreserves to Fred and Rustum Khan--that is where the strain is--you\nmust see that surely--the enemy from below will be trying to come\nforward, and those in the trap to return.  Fred and Rustum Khan are\nbearing all the brunt.  Relieve them!\"\n\nIt did not look good to me that Will should leave Gloria again;\nand Kagig must surely stay there to do the bargaining.  So I took\nMonty's hand to bid him good-by, and limped off through the dark\nto try to find men who would come with me to the shambles below.\nIt wag Kagig and Will together who overtook me, picked me off my\nfeet, and dragged me back, and Will went down alone, with a wave\nof the hand to Gloria, and a laugh that might have made the devil\nthink he liked it.\n\nThen began the conference, I holding a mere watching brief with a\npistol reasonably close to Mahmoud's ear.  And for a time, while\nMonty lived, the elders supported Kagig and insisted on the full\nconcession of his demands.  But Monty, with his head on Gloria's\nlap, died midway of the proceedings;  and after that the elders'\nsuspicion of Kagig reawoke, so that Mahmoud took courage and grew\nmore obstinate.  Kagig called them aside repeatedly to make them\nlisten to his views.\n\n\"You fools!\" he swore at them, cracking his knuckles and twisting\nat his beard alternately.  \"Do you not realize that Mahmoud is\nambitious!  Do you not understand that he must yield all, if you\ninsist!  Otherwise we hang him here to a tree in sight of the burning\ncastle and his own men!  No ambitious rascal is ever willing to\nbe hanged!  Insist!  Insist!\"\n\n\"Ah, Kagig!\" one of them answered.  \"Speak for yourself.  You would\nnot like to be hanged perhaps!  But we must concede him something,\nor how shall he satisfy ambition?  He must be able to go back with\nsomething to his credit in order to satisfy the politicians.\"\n\n\"Oh, my people!  Oh, my people!\" grumbled Kagig.  \"Can you never see?\"\n\nBut they went back to Mahmoud with a fresh proposal, milder than\nthe first;  and eventually, after yielding point by point, until\nKagig begged them kindly to blow his brains out and bury him with\nMonty, they reached a basis on which Mahmoud was willing to\ncapitulate--or to oblige them, as he expressed it.\n\nHe won his main point:  Zeitoon was to accept a Turkish governor.\nThey won theirs, that the governor was to bring no troops with him,\nbut to be contented with a body-guard of Zeitoonli.  For the rest:\nMahmoud was to go free, taking his wounded with him, but surrendering\nall the uninjured Turkish soldiers in the trap as hostages for the\nrelease of all Armenian prisoners taken anywhere between Tarsus and\nZeitoon.  It was agreed there were to be no subsequent reprisals\nby either side, and that hostages were not to be released until after\nMahmoud's army corps should have returned to whence it came.\n\nKagig wrote the terms in Turkish by the light of the holocaust in\nMonty's ancestral keep, and Mahmoud signed the paper in the presence\nof ten witnesses.  But whether he, or his brother Turks, have kept,\nfor instance, the last clause of the agreement, history can answer.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twenty-two\n\"God go with you to the States, effendim!\"\n\n\nARMENIA\n\nFirst of the Christian nations; the first of us all to feel\nThe fire of infidel hatred, the weight of the pagan heel;\nFaithfullest down the ages tending the light that burned,\nTortured and trodden therefore, spat on and slain and spurned;\nBranded for others' vices, robbed of your rightful fame,\nClinging to Truth in a truthless land in the name of the ancient Name;\nGenerous, courteous, gentle, patient under the yoke,\nDecent (hemmed in a harem land ye were ever a one-wife folk);\nRoyal and brave and ancient--haply an hour has struck\nWhen the new fad-fangled peoples shall weary of raking muck,\nAnd turning from coward counsels and loathing the parish lies,\nIn shame and sackcloth offer up the only sacrifice.\nThen thou who hast been neglected, who hast called o'er a world in vain\nTo the deaf deceitful traders' ears in tune to the voice of gain,\nThou Cinderella nation, starved that our appetites might live,\nWhen we come with a hand outstretched at last--accept it, and forgive!\n\n\nThe fighting lasted nearly until dawn, because of the difficulty\nof conveying Mahmoud's orders to the Turks, and Kagig's orders to\nour own tree-hidden firing-line.  But a little before sunrise the\nlast shot was fired, at about the time when most of the castle walls\nfell in and a huge shower of golden sparks shot upward to the paling\nsky.  The cease fire left all Zeitoon's defenders with scarcely a\nthousand rounds of rifle ammunition between them;  but Mahmoud did\nnot know that.\n\nAn hour after dawn Fred joined us.  He had the news of Monty's death\nalready, and said nothing, but pointed to something that his own\nmen bore along on a litter of branches.  A minute or two later they\nlaid Rustum Khan's corpse beside Monty's, and we threw one blanket\nover both of them.\n\nI don't remember that Fred spoke one word.  He and Monty had been\ncloser friends than any brothers I ever knew.  No doubt the awful\nstrain of the fighting at the corner of the woods had left Fred numb\nto some extent;  but he and Monty had never been demonstrative in\ntheir affection, and, as they had lived in almost silent understanding\nof each other, hidden very often for the benefit of strangers by\nkeen mutual criticism, so they parted, Fred not caring to make public\nwhat he thought, or knew, or felt.\n\nKagig, not being in favor with the elders, vanished, Maga following\nwith food for him in a leather bag, and we saw neither of them again\nuntil noon that day, by which time we ourselves had slept a little\nand eaten ravenously.  Then he came to us where we still sat by the\ngreat rock with Mahmoud under guard (for nobody would trust him to\nfulfil his agreement until all his troops had retired from the district,\nleaving behind them such ammunition and supplies as they had carried\nto the gorge below the ramp).\n\nWe had laid both bodies under the one blanket in the shade, and\nKagig pointed to them.\n\n\"I have found the place--the proper place, effendim!\" he said simply.\n\"Maga has made it fit.\"\n\nNot knowing what he meant by that last remark, we invited some big\nArmenians to come with us to carry our honored dead, and followed\nKagig one by one up a goat track (or a bear track, perhaps it was)\nthat wound past the crumbled and blackened castle wall and followed\nthe line of the mountain.  Here and there we could see that Kagig\nhad cleared it a little on his way back, and several times it was\nobvious that there had been a prepared, frequented track in\nancient days.\n\n\"It took time to find,\" said Kagig, glancing back, \"but I thought\nthere must be such a place near such a castle.\"\n\nPresently we emerged on a level ledge of rock, from a square hole\nin the midst of which a great slab had been levered away with the\naid of a pole that lay beside it.  All around the opening Maga had\nspread masses of wild flowers, and either she or Kagig had spread\nout on the rock the great banner with its ships and wheat-sheaves\nthat the women had made by night in Monty's honor.\n\nWe could read the motto plainly now--Per terram et aquam--By land\nand sea;  and Kagig pointed to some marks on the stone slab.  Moss\nhad grown in them and lichens, but he or else Maga had scraped them\nclean;  and there on the stone lay the same legend graven bold and\ndeep, as clear now as when the last crusader of the family was buried\nthere, lord knew how many centuries before.\n\nThe tomb was an enormous place--part cave, and partly hewn--twenty\nfeet by twenty by as many feet deep at the most conservative guess;\nand on four ledges, one on each side, not in their armor, but in\nthe rags of their robes of honor, lay the bones of four earlier\nMontdidiers--all big men, broad-shouldered and long of shin and thigh.\n\nWe did not need to go down into the tomb and break the peace of\ncenturies.  Under the very center of the opening was a raised table\nof hewn rock, part of the cavern floor, about eight feet by eight\nthat seemed to have been left there ready for the next man, or next\ntwo men when their time should come.\n\nDown on to that we lowered Monty's body carefully with leather ropes,\nand then Rustum Khan's beside him, Rustum Khan receiving Christian\nburial, as neither he nor his proud ancestors would have preferred.\nBut his line was as old as Monty's, and he died in the same cause\nand the selfsame battle, so we chose to do his body honor;  and if\nthe prayers that Fred remembered, and the other cheerfuller prayers\nthat Gloria knew, were an offense to the Rajput's lingering ghost,\nwe hoped he might forgive us because of friendship, and esteem, and\nthe homage we did to his valor in burying his body there.\n\nWe covered Monty's body with the banner the women had made, and\nRustum Khan's with flowers, for lack of a better shroud;  then\nlevered and shoved the great slab back until it rested snugly in\nthe grooves the old masons had once cut so accurately as to preserve\nthe bones beneath.\n\nThen, when Gloria had said the last prayer:\n\n\"What next, Kagig?\" Will demanded.\n\nKagig was going to answer, but thought better of it and strode away\nin the lead, we following.  He did not stop until we reached the\nopen and the smoking ruins of the castle walls.  When he stopped:\n\n\"Has any one seen Peter Measel?\" I asked.\n\n\"Forget him!\" growled Will.\n\n\"Why?\" demanded Maga.  \"Will you bury him in that same hole with\nthem two?\"\n\n\"Has any one seen him?\" I asked again, uncertain why I asked, but\ncurious and insistent.\n\n\"Sure!\" said Maga.  \"Yes.  Me I seen 'im.  I keel 'im--so--with a\nknife--las' night!  You not believe?\"\n\nWhether we believed or not, the news surprised us, and we waited\nin silence for an explanation.\n\n\"You not believe?  Why not?  That dog!  'E make of me a dam-fool!\n'E tell me about God.  'E say God is angry with Zeitoon, an' Kagig\nis as good as a dead man, an' I shall take advantage.  'E 'ope 'e\nmarry me.  I 'ope if Kagig die I marry Will Yerkees, but I agree\nwith Measel, making pretend, an' 'e run away to talk 'is fool secrets\nwith the Turks.  Then I make my own arrangements!  But Mahmoud is\nnot succeeding, and I like Kagig better after all.  An' then last\nnight in the darkness Peter Measel he is coming on a 'orse with\nMahmoud because Mahmoud is not trusting him out of sight.  An' I\nsee him, an' 'e see me, an' 'e call me, an' I go to 'im through all\nthe fighting, an' 'e get off the 'orse an' reach out 'is arms to me,\nan' I keel 'im with my knife--so!  An' now you know all about it!\"\n\n\"What next?\" Will demanded dryly.\n\n\"Next?\" said Kagig.  \"You effendim make your escape!  The Turks will\nsurely seek to be revenged on you.  I will show you a way across the\nmountains into Persia.\"\n\n\"And you?\" I asked.\n\n\"Into hiding!\" he answered grimly.  \"Maga--little Maga, she shall\ncome with me, and teach me more about the earth and sky and wind\nand water!  Perhaps at last some day she shall make me--no, never\na king, but a sportman.\"\n\n\"Come with us,\" said Will. \"Come to the States.\"\n\n\"No, no, effendi.  I know my people.  They are good folk.  They\nmistrust me now, and if I were to stay among them where they could\nsee me and accuse me, and where the Turks could make a peg of me\non which to hang mistrust, I should be a source of weakness to them.\nNevertheless, I am ever the Eye of Zeitoon!  I shall go into hiding,\nand watch!  There will come an hour again--infallibly--when the\nTurks will seek to blot out the last vestige of Armenia.  If I hide\nfaithfully, and watch well, by that time I shall be a legend among\nmy people, and when I appear again in their desperation they will\ntrust me.\"\n\nWill met Gloria's eyes in silence for a moment.\n\n\"I've a mind to stay with you, Kagig, and lend a hand,\" he said at last.\n\n\"Nay, nay, effendi!\"\n\n\"We can attach ourselves to some mission station, and be lots of use,\"\nGloria agreed.\n\n\"Use?\" said Kagig, cracking his fingers.  \"The missions have done\ngood work, but you can be of much more use--you two.  You have each\nother.  Go back to the blessed land you come from, and be happy together.\nBut pay the price of happiness!  You have seen.  Go back and tell!\"\n\n\"Tell about Armenian atrocities?\" said Will.  \"Why, man alive, the\npapers are full of them at regular intervals!\"\n\nKagig made a gesture of impatience.\n\n\"Aye!  All about what the Turks have done to us, and how much about\nus ourselves?  America believes that when a Turk merely frowns the\nArmenian lies down and holds his belly ready for the knife!  Who\nwould care to help such miserable-minded men and women?  But you\nhave seen otherwise.  You know the truth.  You have seen that Armenia\nis undermined by mutual suspicion cunningly implanted by the Turk.\nYou have also seen how we rally around one man or a handful whom\nwe know we dare trust!\"\n\n\"True enough!\" said Will.  \"I've wondered at it.\"\n\n\"Then go and tell America,\" Kagig almost snarled with blazing eyes,\n\"to come and help us!  To give us a handful of armed men to rally round!\nTell them we are men and women, not calves for the shambles!  Tell\nthem to reach us out but one finger of one hand for half a dozen\nyears, and watch us grow into a nation!  Preach it from the house-tops!\nTeach it!  Tell it to the sportmen of America that all we need is\na handful to rally round, and we will all be sportmen too!  Go and\ntell them--tell them!\"\n\n\"You bet we will!\" said Gloria.\n\n\"Then go!\" said Kagig.  \"Go by way of Persia, lest the Turks find\nways of stopping up your mouths.  Monty has died to help us.  I\nlive that I may help.  You go and tell the sportmen all.  Tell them\nwe show good sport in Zeitoon--in Armenia!  God go with you\nall, effendim!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Eye of Zeitoon, by Talbot Mundy\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE EYE OF ZEITOON ***\n\n***** This file should be named 5241.txt or 5241.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/2/4/5241/\n\nProduced by M.R.J.\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
