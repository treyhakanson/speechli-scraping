Shall\nthe throne of iniquity have fellowship with Thee, which frameth mischief by\na law?_\"\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nThese paragraphs, dignified by the revised edition of _Gallantry_ and\nspuriously designated An Introduction, are nothing more than a series of\nnotes and haphazard discoveries in preparation of a thesis. That thesis,\nif it is ever written, will bear a title something academically like _The\nPsychogenesis of a Poet; or Cabell the Masquerader_. For it is in this\nguise--sometimes self-declared, sometimes self-concealed, but always as the\npersistent visionary--that the author of some of the finest prose of our\nday has given us the key with which (to lapse into the jargon of verse) he\nhas unlocked his heart.\n\nOn the technical side alone, it is easy to establish Cabell's poetic\nstanding. There are, first of all, the quantity of original rhymes that\nare scattered through the dozen volumes which Cabell has latterly (and\nsignificantly) classified as Biography. Besides these interjections which\ndo duty as mottoes, chapter-headings, tailpieces, dedications, interludes\nand sometimes relevant songs, there is the volume of seventy-five\n\"adaptations\" in verse, _From the Hidden Way_, published in 1916. Here\nCabell, even in his most natural r\u00f4le, declines to show his face and amuses\nhimself with a new set of masks labelled Alessandro de Medici, Antoine\nRiczi, Nicolas de Caen, Theodore Passerat and other fabulous minnesingers\nwhose verses were created only in the mind of Cabell. It has pleased him to\nconfuse others besides the erudite reviewer of the _Boston Transcript_ by\nquoting the first lines of the non-existent originals in Latin, Italian,\nProven\u00e7al--thus making his skilful ballades, sestinas and the less medi\u00e6val\nnarratives part of a remarkably elaborate and altogether successful hoax.\n\nAnd, as this masquerade of obscure Parnassians betrayed its creator,\nCabell--impelled by some fantastic reticence--sought for more subtle\nmakeshifts to hide the poet. The unwritten thesis, plunging abruptly into\nthe realm of analytical psychology, will detail the steps Cabell has taken,\nas a result of early associative disappointments, to repress or at least\nto disguise, the poet in himself--and it will disclose how he has failed.\nIt will burrow through the latest of his works and exhume his half-buried\nexperiments in rhyme, assonance and polyphony. This part of the paper will\nexamine _Jurgen_ and call attention to the distorted sonnet printed as a\nprose soliloquy on page 97 of that exquisite and ironic volume. It will\npass to the subsequent _Figures of Earth_ and, after showing how the\ngreater gravity of this volume is accompanied by a greater profusion of\npoetry _per se_ it will unravel the scheme of Cabell's fifteen essays in\nwhat might be called contrapuntal prose. It will unscramble all the rhymes\nscreened in Manuel's monologue beginning on page 294, quote the metrical\ninnovations with rhymed vowels on page 60, tabulate the hexameters that\nleap from the solidly set paragraphs and rearrange the brilliant fooling\nthat opens the chapter \"Magic of the Image Makers.\" This last is in itself\nso felicitous a composite of verse and criticism--a passage incredibly\noverlooked by the most meticulous of Cabell's glossarians--that it deserves\na paper for itself. For here, set down prosaically as \"the unfinished Rune\nof the Blackbirds\" are four distinct parodies--including two insidious\nburlesques of Browning and Swinburne--on a theme which is familiar to us\nto-day in _les mots justes_ of Mother Goose. \"It is,\" explains Freydis,\nafter the thaumaturgists have finished, \"an experimental incantation in\nthat it is a bit of unfinished magic for which the proper words have not\nyet been found: but between now and a while they will be stumbled on, and\nthen this rune will live perpetually.\" And thus the poet, speaking through\nthe mouth-piece of Freydis, discourses on the power of words and, in one of\nCabell's most eloquent chapters, crystallizes that high mood, presenting\nthe case for poetry as it has been pleaded by few of her most fervid\nadvocates.\n\nHere the thesis will stop quoting and argue its main contention from\nanother angle. It will consider the author in a larger and less technical\nsense: disclosing his characters, his settings, his plots, even the entire\ngenealogical plan of his works, to be the design of a poet rather than a\nnovelist. The persons of Cabell's imagination move to no haphazard strains;\nthey create their own music. And, like a set of modulated _motifs_, they\ncombine to form a richer and more sonorous pattern. With its interrelation\nof figures and interweaving of themes, the Cabellian \"Biography\" assumes\nthe solidity and shapeliness of a fugue, a composition in which all the\nvoices speak with equal precision and recurring clarity.\n\nAnd what, the diagnostician may inquire, of the characters themselves? They\nare, it will be answered, motivated by pity and irony; the tolerant humor,\nthe sympathetic and not too distant regard of their Olympian designer\nagitate them so sensitively that we seldom see what strings are twitched.\nThese puppets seem to act of their own conviction--possibly because their\ndirector is careful not to have too many convictions of his own. It may\nhave been pointed out before this that there are no undeviating villains\nin his masques and, as many an indignant reviewer has expostulated, few\nuntarnished heroes. Cabell's, it will be perceived, is a frankly pagan\npoetry. It has no texts with which to discipline beauty; it lacks moral\nfervor; it pretends to no divinity of dogmatism. The image-maker is willing\nto let his creatures ape their living models by fluctuating between\nshifting conventions and contradictory ideals; he leaves to a more positive\nAuthor the dubious pleasure of drawing a daily line between vice and\nvirtue. If Cabell pleads at all, he pleads with us not to repudiate a\nVillon or a Marlowe while we are reviling the imperfect man in a perfect\npoet. \"What is man, that his welfare be considered?\" questions Cabell,\nparaphrasing Scripture, \"an ape who chatters to himself of kinship with the\narchangels while filthily he digs for groundnuts.... Yet do I perceive that\nthis same man is a maimed god.... He is under penalty condemned to compute\neternity with false weights and to estimate infinity with a yardstick--and\nhe very often does it.\"\n\nThis, the thesis will contend, is the only possible attitude to the mingled\napathy and abandon of existence--and it is, in fine, the poetic attitude.\nRomantic it is, without question, and I imagine Cabell would be the last\nto cavil at the implication. For, mocked by a contemptuous silence gnawing\nbeneath the howling energy of life, what else is there for the poet but the\nsearch for some miracle of belief, some assurance in a world of illimitable\nperplexities? It is the wish to attain this dream which is more real than\nreality that guides the entire Cabell _epos_--\"and it is this will that\nstirs in us to have the creatures of earth and the affairs of earth, not as\nthey are, but as 'they ought to be.'\"\n\nSuch a romantic vision, which concludes that glowing testament, _Beyond\nLife_, is the shining thread that binds the latest of Cabell's novels\nwith the earliest of his short stories. It is, in effect, one tale he is\ntelling, a tale in which Poictesme and the more local Lichfield are, for\nall their topographical dissimilarities, the same place, and all his people\ninterchangeable symbols of the changeless desires of men. Whether the\nallegory is told in the terms of _Gallantry_ with its perfumed lights, its\ndeliberate artifice and its technique of badinage, or presented in the\nmore high-flying mood of _Chivalry_ with its ready passions and readier\nrhetoric, it prefigures the subsequent pageant in which the victories might\nso easily be mistaken for defeats. In this procession, amid a singularly\nordered riot of color, the figure of man moves, none too confidently but\nwith stirring fortitude, to an unrealized end. Here, stumbling through the\nmazes of a code, in the habiliments of Ormskirk or de Soyecourt, he passes\nfrom the adventures of the mind (Kennaston in _The Cream of the Jest_,\nCharteris in _Beyond Life_) through the adventures of the flesh (_Jurgen_)\nto the darker adventures of the spirit (Manuel in _Figures of Earth_).\nEven this _Gallantry_, the most candidly superficial of Cabell's works, is\nalive with a vigor of imagination and irony. It is not without significance\nthat the motto on the new title-page is: \"Half in masquerade, playing the\ndrawing-room or garden comedy of life, these persons have upon them, not\nless than the landscape among the accidents of which they group themselves,\na certain light that we should seek for in vain upon anything real.\"\n\nThe genealogically inclined will be happy to discover that _Gallantry_,\nfor all its revulsion from reality, deals with the perpetuated life of\nManuel in a strangely altered _milieu_. The rest of us will be quicker to\ncomprehend how subtly this volume takes its peculiar place in its author's\nrecord of struggling dreams, how, beneath, a surface covered with political\nfinery and sentimental bric-\u00e0-brac, the quest goes on, stubbornly and often\nstupidly, in a forgotten world made suddenly animate and as real as our\nown.\n\nAnd this, the thesis will conclude, is because Cabell is not as much a\nmasquerader as he imagines himself to be. None but a visionary could wear\nso constantly upon his sleeve the desire \"to write perfectly of beautiful\nhappenings.\" None but the poet, shaken with the strength of his vision,\ncould cry to-day, \"It is only by preserving faith in human dreams that\nwe may, after all, perhaps some day make them come true.\" For poetry, to\nwhich all literature aspires, is not the shadow of reality but the image of\nperfection, the light of disembodied beauty toward which creation gropes.\nAnd that poetic consciousness is the key to the complex and half-concealed\nart of James Branch Cabell.\n\nLOUIS UNTERMEYER.\n\nNew York City,\n_April, 1922._\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n\nTHE EPISTLE DEDICATORY\n\nTHE PROLOGUE\n\nI SIMON'S HOUR\n\nII LOVE AT MARTINMAS\n\nIII THE CASUAL HONEYMOON\n\nIV THE RHYME TO PORRINGER\n\nV ACTORS ALL\n\nVI APRIL'S MESSAGE\n\nVII IN THE SECOND APRIL\n\nVIII HEART OF GOLD\n\nIX THE SCAPEGOATS\n\nX THE DUCAL AUDIENCE\n\nLOVE'S ALUMNI: THE AFTERPIECE\n\nTHE EPILOGUE\n\n\n\n\nTHE EPISTLE DEDICATORY\n\n_TO MRS. GRUNDY_\n\n\nMadam,--It is surely fitting that a book which harks back to the manners\nof the second George should have its dedication and its patron. And these\ncomedies claim naturally your protection, since it likewise appears\na custom of that era for the poet to dedicate his book to his most\ninfluential acquaintance and the one least likely to value it.\n\nIndeed, it is as proper that the plaudits of great persons be reserved for\ngreat performances as it is undeniable these\n\n      tiny pictures of that tiny time\n  Aim little at the lofty and sublime.\n\nYet cognoscenti still esteem it an error in the accomplished Shakespeare\nthat he introduced a game of billiards into his portrayal of Queen\nCleopatra's court; and the impropriety had been equal had I linked the\nextreme of any passion with an age and circle wherein abandonment to\nthe emotions was adjudged bucolic, nay, Madam, the Eumenides were very\nterrifying at Delphi, no doubt, but deck them with paint, patch, and\npanniers, send them howling among the _beau monde_ on the Pantiles, and\nthey are only figures of fun; nor may, in reason, the high woes of a second\nLear, or of a new Prometheus, be adequately lighted by the flambeaux of\nLouis Quinze.\n\nConceive, then, the overture begun, and fear not, if the action of the play\ndemand a lion, but that he shall be a beast of Peter Quince's picking. The\nladies shall not be frighted, for our chief comedians will enact modish\npeople of a time when gallantry prevailed.\n\nNow the essence of gallantry, I take it, was to accept the pleasures of\nlife leisurely and its inconveniences with a shrug. As requisites, a\ngallant person will, of course, be \"amorous, but not too constant, have\na pleasant voice, and possess a talent for love-letters.\" He will always\nbear in mind that in love-affairs success is less the Ultima Thule of\ndesire than its _coup de gr\u00e2ce_, and he will be careful never to admit the\nfact, especially to himself. He will value ceremony, but rather for its\ncomeliness than for its utility, as one esteeming the lily, say, to be a\nmore applaudable bulb than the onion. He will prink; and he will be at his\nbest after sunset. He will dare to acknowledge the shapeliness of a thief's\nleg, to contend that the commission of murder does not necessarily impair\nthe agreeableness of the assassin's conversation; and to insist that at\nbottom God is kindlier than the genteel would regard as rational. He will,\nin fine, sin on sufficient provocation, and repent within the moment,\nquite sincerely, and be not unconscionably surprised when he repeats the\nprogression: and he will consider the world with a smile of toleration, and\nhis own doings with a smile of honest amusement, and Heaven with a smile\nthat is not distrustful.\n\nThis particular attitude toward life may have its merits, but it is not\nconducive to meticulous morality; therefore, in advance, I warn you that my\n_Dramatis Person\u00e6_ will in their display of the cardinal virtues evince a\ncertain parsimony. Theirs were, in effect, not virtuous days. And the great\nman who knew these times _au fond_, and loved them, and wrote of them as no\nother man may ever hope to do, has said of these same times, with perfect\ntruth:\n\n\"Fiddles sing all through them; wax-lights, fine dresses, fine jokes,\nfine plate, fine equipages, glitter and sparkle: never was there such\na brilliant, jigging, smirking Vanity Fair. But wandering through that\ncity of the dead, that dreadfully selfish time, through those godless\nintrigues and feasts, through those crowds, pushing, and eager, and\nstruggling,--rouged, and lying, and fawning,--I have wanted some one to be\nfriends with. I have said, _Show me some good person about that Court; find\nme, among those selfish courtiers, those dissolute gay people, some one\nbeing that I can love and regard._\" And Thackeray confesses that, for all\nhis research, he could not find anybody living irreproachably, at this\nespecial period....\n\nWhere a giant fails one may in reason hesitate to essay. I present, then,\npeople who, as people normally do, accepted their times and made the best\nof them, since the most estimable needs conform a little to the custom of\nhis day, whether it be Caractacus painting himself sky-blue or Galileo on\nhis knees at Santa Maria. And accordingly, many of my comedians will lie\nwhen it seems advisable, and will not haggle over a misdemeanor when there\nis anything to be gained by it; at times their virtues will get them\nwhat they want, and at times their vices, and at other times they will\nbe neither punished nor rewarded; in fine, Madam, they will be just human\nbeings stumbling through illogical lives with precisely that lack of\ncommon-sense which so pre-eminently distinguishes all our neighbors from\nourselves.\n\nFor the life that moved in old Manuel of Poictesme finds hereinafter in his\ndescendants, in these later Allonbys and Bulmers and Heleighs and Floyers,\na new _milieu_ to conform and curb that life in externes rather than in\nessentials. What this life made of chivalrous conditions has elsewhere\nbeen recorded: with its renewal in gallant circumstances, the stage is\ndifferently furnished and lighted, the costumes are dissimilar; but the\ncomedy, I think, works toward the same _d\u00e9nouement_, and certainly the\nprotagonist remains unchanged. My protagonist is still the life of Manuel,\nas this life was perpetuated in his descendants; and my endeavor is (still)\nto show you what this life made (and omitted to make) of its tenancy of\nearth. 'Tis a drama enactable in any setting.\n\nYet the comedy of gallantry has its conventions. There must be quite\ninvaluable papers to be stolen and juggled with; an involuntary\nmarriage either threatened or consummated; elopements, highwaymen, and\ndespatch-boxes; and a continual indulgence in soliloquy and eavesdropping.\nEverybody must pretend to be somebody else, and young girls, in particular,\nmust go disguised as boys, amid much cut-and-thrust work, both ferric and\nverbal. For upon the whole, the comedy of gallantry tends to unfold itself\nin dialogue, and yet more dialogue, with just the notice of a change\nof scene or a brief stage direction inserted here and there. All these\nconventions, Madam, I observe.\n\nA word more: the progress of an author who alternates, in turn, between\nfact and his private fancies (like unequal crutches) cannot in reason be\nundisfigured by false steps. Therefore it is judicious to confess, Madam,\nthat more than once I have pieced the opulence of my subject with the\npoverty of my inventions. Indisputably, to thrust words into a dead man's\nmouth is in the ultimate as unpardonable as the axiomatic offence of\nstealing the pennies from his eyes; yet if I have sometimes erred in my\nsurmise at what Ormskirk or de Puysange or Louis de Soyecourt really said\nat certain moments of their lives, the misstep was due, Madam, less to\nmalevolence than to inability to replevin their superior utterance; and the\naccomplished shade of Garendon, at least, I have not travestied, unless it\nwere through some too prudent item of excision.\n\nRemains but to subscribe myself--in the approved formula of dedicators--as,\n\n  MADAM,\n\n    Your ladyship's most humble and most obedient servant,\n\n                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PROLOGUE\n\nSPOKEN BY LADY ALLONBY, WHO ENTERS IN A FLURRY\n\n\n    _The author bade we come_--Lud, I protest!--\n  _He bade me come_--and I forget the rest.\n  But 'tis no matter; he's an arrant fool\n  That ever bade a woman speak by rule.\n\n    Besides, his Prologue was, at best, dull stuff,\n  And of dull writing we have, sure, enough.\n  A book will do when you've a vacant minute,\n  But, la! who cares what is, and isn't, in it?\n\n    And since I'm but the Prologue of a book,\n  What I've omitted all will overlook,\n  And owe me for it, too, some gratitude,\n  Seeing in reason it cannot be good\n  Whose author has as much but now confessed,--\n  For, _Who'd excel when few can make a test\n  Betwixt indifferent writing and the best?_\n  He said but now.\n\n                           And I:--_La, why excel,\n  When mediocrity does quite as well?\n  'Tis women buy the books,--and read 'em, say,\n  What time a person nods, en n\u00e9glig\u00e9e,\n  And in default of gossip, cards, or dance,\n  Resolves t' incite a nap with some romance._\n\n  The fool replied in verse,--I think he said\n  'Twas verses the ingenious Dryden made,\n  And trust 'twill save me from entire disgrace\n  To cite 'em in his foolish Prologue's place.\n    _Yet, scattered here and there, I some behold,\n  Who can discern the tinsel from the gold;\n  To these he writes; and if by them allowed,\n  'Tis their prerogative to rule the crowd,\n  For he more fears, like, a presuming man,\n  Their votes who cannot judge, than theirs can._\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nSIMON'S HOUR\n\n\n_As Played at Stornoway Crag, March 25, 1750_\n\n\"_You're a woman--one to whom Heaven gave beauty, when it grafted roses on\na briar.

In fine, we begin toward the end of March, in\nthe year 1750, when Lady Allonby and her brother, Mr. Henry Heleigh, of\nTrevor's Folly, were the guests of Lord Rokesle, at Stornoway Crag, on Usk.\n\nAs any person of _ton_ could have informed you, Anastasia Allonby was the\nwidow (by his second marriage) of Lord Stephen Allonby, the Marquis of\nFalmouth's younger brother; and it was conceded by the most sedate that\nLord Stephen's widow, in consideration of her liberal jointure, possessed\ninordinate comeliness.\n\nShe was tall for a woman. Her hair, to-night unpowdered, had the color of\namber and something, too, of its glow; her eyes, though not profound, were\nlarge and in hue varied, as the light fell or her emotions shifted, through\na wide gamut of blue shades. But it was her mouth you remembered: the\nfulness and brevity of it, the deep indentation of its upper lip, the\ncurves of it and its vivid crimson--these roused you to wildish speculation\nas to its probable softness when Lady Allonby and Fate were beyond ordinary\nlenient. Pink was the color most favorable to her complexion, and this\nshe wore to-night; the gown was voluminous, with a profusion of lace, and\nafforded everybody an ample opportunity to appraise her neck and bosom.\nLady Allonby had no reason to be ashamed of either, and the last mode in\nthese matters was not prudish.\n\nTo such a person, enters Simon Orts, chaplain in ordinary to Lord Rokesle,\nand Vicar of Heriz Magna, one of Lord Rokesle's livings.\n\n\nI\n\n\"Now of a truth,\" said Simon Orts, \"that is curious--undeniably that is\ncurious.\"\n\nHe stayed at the door for a moment staring back into the ill-lit corridor.\nPresently he shut the door, and came forward toward the fireplace.\n\nLady Allonby, half-hidden in the depths of the big chair beside the\nchimney-piece, a book in her lap, looked up inquiringly. \"What is curious,\nMr. Orts?\"\n\nThe clergyman stood upon the hearth, warming his hands, and diffusing an\nodor of tobacco and stale alcohol. \"Faith, that damned rascal--I beg your\npardon, Anastasia; our life upon Usk is not conducive to a mincing nicety\nof speech. That rascal Punshon made some difficulty over admitting me; you\nmight have taken him for a sentinel, with Stornoway in a state of siege. He\nruffled me,--and I don't like it,\" Simon Orts said, reflectively, looking\ndown upon her. \"No, I don't like it. Where's your brother?\" he demanded on\na sudden.\n\n\"Harry and Lord Rokesle are at cards, I believe. And Mrs. Morfit has\nretired to her apartments with one of her usual headaches, so that I have\nbeen alone these two hours. You visit Stornoway somewhat late, Mr. Orts,\"\nAnastasia Allonby added, without any particular concealment of the fact\nthat she considered his doing so a nuisance.\n\nHe jerked his thumb ceilingward. \"The cloth is at any rascal's beck and\ncall. Old Holles, my Lord's man, is dying up yonder, and the whim seized\nhim to have a clergyman in. God knows why, for it appears to me that one\nknave might very easily make his way to hell without having another knave\nto help him. And Holles?--eh, well, from what I myself know of him, the\nrogue is triply damned.\" His mouth puckered as he set about unbuttoning his\nlong, rain-spattered cloak, which, with his big hat, he flung aside upon a\ntable. \"Gad!\" said Simon Orts, \"we are most of us damned on Usk; and that\nis why I don't like it--\" He struck his hand against his thigh. \"I don't\nlike it, Anastasia.\"\n\n\"You must pardon me,\" she languidly retorted, \"but I was never good at\nriddles.\"\n\nHe turned and glanced about the hall, debating. Lady Allonby meanwhile\nregarded him, as she might have looked at a frog or a hurtless snake. A\nsmall, slim, anxious man, she found him; always fidgeting, always placating\nsome one, but never without a covert sneer. The fellow was venomous; his\neyes only were honest, for even while his lips were about their wheedling,\nthese eyes flashed malice at you; and their shifting was so unremittent\nthat afterward you recalled them as an absolute shining which had not any\ncolor. On Usk and thereabouts they said it was the glare from within of his\ndamned soul, already at white heat; but they were a plain-spoken lot on\nUsk. To-night Simon Orts was all in black; and his hair, too, and his gross\neyebrows were black, and well-nigh to the cheek-bones of his clean-shaven\ncountenance the thick beard, showed black through the skin.\n\nNow he kept silence for a lengthy interval, his arms crossed on his breast,\ngnawing meanwhile at the fingernails of his left hand in an unattractive\nfashion he had of meditating. When words came it was in a torrent.\n\n\"I will read you my riddle, then. You are a widow, rich; as women go, you\nare not so unpleasant to look at as most of 'em. If it became a clergyman\nto dwell upon such matters, I would say that your fleshly habitation is\ntoo fine for its tenant, since I know you to be a good-for-nothing jilt.\nHowever, you are God's handiwork, and doubtless He had His reasons for\nconstructing you. My Lord is poor; last summer at Tunbridge you declined to\nmarry him. I am in his confidence, you observe. He took your decision in\nsilence--'ware Rokesle when he is quiet! Eh, I know the man,--'tisn't for\nnothing that these ten years past I have studied his whims, pampered his\nvanity, lied to him, toadied him! You admire my candor?--faith, yes, I\nam very candid. I am Rokesle's hanger-on; he took me out of the gutter,\nand in my fashion I am grateful. And you?--Anastasia, had you treated me\nmore equitably fifteen years ago, I would have gone to the stake for you,\nsinging; now I don't value you the flip of a farthing. But, for old time's\nsake, I warn you. You and your brother are Rokesle's guests--on Usk!\nHarry Heleigh [Footnote: Henry Heleigh, thirteenth Earl of Brudenel, who\nsucceeded his cousin the twelfth Earl in 1759, and lived to a great age.\nBavois, writing in 1797, calls him \"a very fine, strong old gentleman.\"]\ncan handle a sword, I grant you,--but you are on Usk! And Mrs. Morfit is\nhere to play propriety--propriety on Usk, God save the mark! And besides,\nRokesle can twist his sister about his little finger, as the phrase runs.\nAnd I find sentinels at the door! I don't like it, Anastasia. In his way\nRokesle loves you; more than that, you are an ideal match to retrieve his\nbattered fortunes; and the name of my worthy patron, I regret to say, is\nnot likely ever to embellish the Calendar of Saints.\"\n\nSimon Orts paused with a short laugh. The woman had risen to her feet,\nher eyes widening and a thought troubled, though her lips smiled\ncontemptuously.\n\n\"La, I should have comprehended that this late in the evening you would be\nin no condition to converse with ladies. Believe me, though, Mr. Orts, I\nwould be glad to credit your warning to officious friendliness, were it not\nthat the odor about your person compels me to attribute it to gin.\"\n\n\"Oh, I have been drinking,\" he conceded; \"I have been drinking with a\nmost commendable perseverance for these fifteen years. But at present I am\nfar from drunk.\" Simon Orts took a turn about the hall; in an instant he\nfaced her with an odd, almost tender smile, \"You adorable, empty-headed,\npink-and-white fool,\" said Simon Orts, \"what madness induced you to come to\nUsk? You know that Rokesle wants you; you know that you don't mean to marry\nhim. Then why come to Usk? Do you know who is king in this sea-washed scrap\nof earth?--Rokesle. German George reigns yonder in England, but here, in\nthe Isle of Usk, Vincent Floyer is king. And it is not precisely a convent\nthat he directs. The men of Usk, I gather, after ten years' experience in\nthe administering of spiritual consolation hereabouts\"--and his teeth made\ntheir appearance in honor of the jest,--\"are part fisherman, part smuggler,\npart pirate, and part devil. Since the last ingredient predominates, they\nhave no very unreasonable apprehension of hell, and would cheerfully invade\nit if Rokesle bade 'em do so. As I have pointed out, my worthy patron is\nsubject to the frailties of the flesh. Oh, I am candid, for if you report\nme to his Lordship I shall lie out of it. I have had practice enough to do\nit handsomely. But Rokesle--do you not know what Rokesle is--?\"\n\nThe Vicar of Heriz Magna would have gone on, but Lady Allonby had\ninterrupted, her cheeks flaming. \"Yes, yes,\" she cried;' \"I know him to\nbe a worthy gentleman. 'Tis true I could not find it in my heart to marry\nhim, yet I am proud to rank Lord Rokesle among my friends.\" She waved her\nhand toward the chimney-piece, where hung--and hangs to-day,--the sword of\nAluric Floyer, the founder of the house of Rokesle. \"Do you see that old\nsword, Mr. Orts? The man who wielded it long ago was a gallant gentleman\nand a stalwart captain. And my Lord, as he told me but on Thursday\nafternoon, hung it there that he might always have in mind the fact that\nhe bore the name of this man, and must bear it meritoriously. My Lord is\na gentleman. La, believe me, if you, too, were a gentleman, Mr. Orts, you\nwould understand! But a gentleman is not a talebearer; a gentleman does not\ndefame any person behind his back, far less the person to whom he owes his\ndaily bread.\"\n\n\"So he has been gulling you?\" said Simon Orts; then he added quite\ninconsequently: \"I had not thought anything you could say would hurt me. I\ndiscover I was wrong. Perhaps I am not a gentleman. Faith, no; I am only a\nshabby drunkard, a disgrace to my cloth, am I not, Anastasia? Accordingly,\nI fail to perceive what old Aluric Floyer has to do with the matter in\nhand. He was reasonably virtuous, I suppose; putting aside a disastrous\nappetite for fruit, so was Adam: but, viewing their descendants, I ruefully\nadmit that in each case the strain has deteriorated.\"\n\nThere was a brief silence; then Lady Allonby observed: \"Perhaps I was\ndiscourteous. I ask your forgiveness, Mr. Orts. And now, if you will pardon\nthe suggestion, I think you had better go to your dying parishioner.\"\n\nBut she had touched the man to the quick. \"I am a drunkard; who made me\nso? Who was it used to cuddle me with so many soft words and kisses--yes,\nkisses, my Lady!--till a wealthier man came a-wooing, and then flung me\naside like an old shoe?\"\n\nThis drenched her cheeks with crimson, \"I think we had better not refer to\nthat boy-and-girl affair. You cannot blame me for your debauched manner\nof living. I found before it was too late that I did not love you. I was\nonly a girl, and 'twas natural that at first I should be mistaken in my\nfancies.\"\n\nThe Vicar had caught her by each wrist. \"You don't understand, of course.\nYou never understood, for you have no more heart than one of those\npink-and-white bisque figures that you resemble. You don't love me, and\ntherefore I will go to the devil' may not be an all-rational deduction, but\n'tis very human logic. You don't understand that, do you, Anastasia? You\ndon't understand how when one is acutely miserable one remembers that at\nthe bottom of a wineglass--or even at the bottom of a tumbler of gin,--one\nmay come upon happiness, or at least upon acquiescence to whatever the\nniggling gods may send. You don't understand how one remembers, when the\ndesired woman is lost, that there are other women whose lips are equally\nred and whose hearts are tenderer and--yes, whose virtue is less exigent.\nNo; women never understand these things: and in any event, you would not\nunderstand, because you are only an adorable pink-and-white fool.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" she cried, struggling, \"How dare you? You insult me, you coward!\"\n\n\"Well, you can always comfort yourself with the reflection that it scarcely\nmatters what a sot like me may elect to say. And, since you understand me\nnow no more than formerly, Anastasia, I tell you that the lover turned\nadrift may well profit by the example of his predecessors. Other lovers\nhave been left forsaken, both in trousers and in ripped petticoats; and\nI have heard that when Chryseis was reft away from Agamemnon, the _cnax\nandr\u00f4n_ made himself tolerably comfortable with Briseis; and that, when\nTheseus sneaked off in the night, Ariadne, after having wept for a\ndecent period, managed in the ultimate to console herself with Theban\nBacchus,--which I suppose to be a courteous method of stating that the\ndaughter of Minos took to drink. So the forsaken lover has his choice of\nconsolation--in wine or in that dearer danger, woman. I have tried both,\nAnastasia. And I tell you--\"\n\nHe dropped her hands as though they had been embers. Lord Rokesle had come\nquietly into the hall.\n\n\"Why, what's this?\" Lord Rokesle demanded. \"Simon, you aren't making love\nto Lady Allonby, I hope? Fie, man! remember your cloth.\"\n\nSimon Orts wheeled--a different being, servile and cringing. \"Your Lordship\nis pleased to be pleasant. Indeed, though, I fear that your ears must\nburn, sir, for I was but now expatiating upon the manifold kindnesses your\nLordship has been so generous as to confer upon your unworthy friend. I was\nadmiring Lady Allonby's ruffle, sir,--Valenciennes, I take it, and very\nchoice.\"\n\nLord Rokesle laughed. \"So I am to thank you for blowing my trumpet, am I?\"\nsaid Lord Rokesle. \"Well, you are not a bad fellow, Simon, so long as you\nare sober. And now be off with you to Holles--the rascal is dying, they\ntell me. My luck, Simon! He made up a cravat better than any one in the\nkingdom.\"\n\n\"The ways of Providence are inscrutable,\" Simon Orts considered; \"and\nif Providence has in verity elected to chasten your Lordship, doubtless\nit shall be, as anciently in the case of Job the Patriarch, repaid by a\nrecompense, by a thousandfold recompense.\" And after a meaning glance\ntoward Lady Allonby,--a glance that said: \"I, too, have a tongue,\"--he was\nmounting the stairway to the upper corridor when Lord Rokesle called to\nhim.\n\n\"By my conscience! I forgot,\" said Lord Rokesle; \"don't leave Stornoway\nwithout seeing me again, I shall want you by and by.\"\n\n\nII\n\nLord Rokesle sat down upon the long, high-backed bench, beside the fire,\nand facing Lady Allonby's arm-chair.\n\nNeither he nor Lady Allonby spoke for a while.\n\nIn a sombre way Lord Rokesle was a handsome man, and to-night, in brown\nand gold, very stately. His bearing savored faintly of the hidalgo; indeed,\nhis mother was a foreign woman, cast ashore on Usk, from a wrecked Spanish\nvessel, and incontinently married by the despot of the island. For her,\nDeath had delayed his advent unmercifully; but her reason survived the\nmarriage by two years only, and there were those familiar with the late\nLord Rokesle's [Footnote: Born 1685, and accidentally killed by Sir\nPiers Sabiston in 1738; an accurate account of this notorious duellist,\nprofligate, charlatan, and playwright is given in Ireson's _Letters_.]\npeculiarities who considered that in this, at least, the crazed lady was\nfortunate. Among these gossips it was also esteemed a matter deserving\ncomment that in the shipwrecks not infrequent about Usk the women sometimes\nsurvived, but the men never.\n\nNow Lord Rokesle regarded Lady Allonby, the while that she displayed\nconspicuous interest in the play of the flames. But by and by, \"O\nvulgarity!\" said Lady Allonby. \"Pray endeavor to look a little more\ncheerful. Positively, you are glaring at me like one of those disagreeable\nbeggars one so often sees staring at bakery windows.\"\n\nHe smiled. \"Do you remember what the Frenchman wrote--_et pain ne voyent\nqu'aux fen\u00eatres?_ There is not an enormous difference between me and the\ntattered rascal of Chepe, for we both stare longingly at what we most\ndesire. And were I minded to hunt the simile to the foot of the letter,\nI would liken your coquetry to the intervening window-pane,--not easily\nbroken through, but very, very transparent, Anastasia.\"\n\n\"You are not overwhelmingly polite,\" she said, reflectively; \"but, then, I\nsuppose, living in the country is sure to damage a man's manners. Still, my\ndear Orson, you smack too much of the forest.\"\n\n\"Anastasia,\" said Lord Rokesle, bending toward her, \"will you always be\nthus cruel? Do you not understand that in this world you are the only thing\nI care for? You think me a boor; perhaps I am,--and yet it rests with you,\nmy Lady, to make me what you will. For I love you, Anastasia--\"\n\n\"Why, how delightful of you!\" said she, languidly.\n\n\"It is not a matter for jesting. I tell you that I love you.\" My Lord's\ncolor was rising.\n\nBut Lady Allonby yawned. \"Your honor's most devoted,\" she declared herself;\n\"still, you need not boast of your affection as if falling in love with me\nwere an uncommonly difficult achievement. That, too, is scarcely polite.\"\n\n\"For the tenth time I ask you will you marry me?\" said Lord Rokesle.\n\n\"Is't only the tenth time? Dear me, it seems like the thousandth. Of\ncourse, I couldn't think of it. Heavens, my Lord, how can you expect me to\nmarry a man who glares at me like that? Positively you look as ferocious as\nthe blackamoor in the tragedy,--the fellow who smothered his wife because\nshe misplaced a handkerchief, you remember.\"\n\nLord Rokesle had risen, and he paced the hall, as if fighting down\nresentment. \"I am no Othello,\" he said at last; \"though, indeed, I think\nthat the love I bear you is of a sort which rarely stirs our English blood.\n'Tis not for nothing I am half-Spaniard, I warn you, Anastasia, my love is\na consuming blaze that will not pause for considerations of policy nor even\nof honor. And you madden me, Anastasia! To-day you hear my protestations\nwith sighs and glances and faint denials; to-morrow you have only taunts\nfor me. Sometimes, I think, 'tis hatred rather than love I bear you.\nSometimes--\" He clutched at his breast with a wild gesture. \"I burn!\" he\nsaid. \"Woman, give me back a human heart in place of this flame you have\nkindled here, or I shall go mad! Last night I dreamed of hell, and of souls\ntoasted on burning forks and fed with sops of bale-fire,--and you were\nthere, Anastasia, where the flames leaped and curled like red-blazoned\nsnakes about the poor damned. And I, too, was there. And through eternity I\nheard you cry to God in vain, O dear, wonderful, golden-haired woman! and\nwe could see Him, somehow,--see Him, a great way off, with straight, white\nbrows that frowned upon you pitilessly. And I was glad. For I knew then\nthat I hated you. And even now, when I think I must go mad for love of you,\nI yet hate you with a fervor that shakes and thrills in every fibre of\nme. Oh, I burn, I burn!\" he cried, with the same frantic clutching at his\nbreast.\n\nLady Allonby had risen.\n\n\"Positively, I must ask you to open a window if you intend to continue in\nthis strain. D'ye mean to suffocate me, my Lord, with your flames and your\nblazes and your brimstone and so on? You breathe conflagrations, like a\ndevil in a pantomime. I had as soon converse with a piece of fireworks. So,\nif you'll pardon me, I will go to my brother.\"\n\nAt the sound of her high, crisp speech his frenzy fell from him like a\nmantle. \"And you let me kiss you yesterday! Oh, I know you struggled, but\nyou did not struggle very hard, did you, Anastasia?\"\n\n\"Why, what a notion!\" cried Lady Allonby; \"as if a person should bother\nseriously one way or the other about the antics of an amorous clodhopper!\nMeanwhile, I repeat, my Lord, I wish to go to my brother.\"\n\n\"Egad!\" Lord Rokesle retorted, \"that reminds me I have been notably remiss.\nI bear you a message from Harry. He had to-night a letter from Job Nangle,\nwho, it seems, has a purchaser for Trevor's Folly at last. The fellow is\nwith our excellent Nangle at Peniston Friars, and offers liberal terms if\nthe sale be instant. The chance was too promising to let slip, so Harry\nleft the island an hour ago. It happened by a rare chance that some of my\nfellows were on the point of setting out for the mainland,--and he knew\nthat he could safely entrust you to Mrs. Morfit's duennaship, he said.\"\n\n\"He should not have done so,\" Lady Allonby observed, as if in a contention\nof mind. \"He--I will go to Mrs. Morfit, then, to confess to her in\nfrankness that, after all these rockets and bonfires--\"\n\n\"Why, that's the unfortunate part of the whole affair,\" said Lord Rokesle.\n\"The same boat brought Sabina a letter which summoned her to the bedside\nof her husband, [Footnote: Archibald Morfit, M.P. for Salop, and in 1753\nelected Speaker, which office he declined on account of ill-health. He was\ncreated a baronet in 1758 through the Duke of Ormskirk's influence.] who,\nit appears, lies desperately ill at Kuyper Manor. It happened by a rare\nchance that some of my fellows were on the point of setting out for the\nmainland--from Heriz pier yonder, not from the end of the island whence\nHarry sailed,--so she and her maid embarked instanter. Of course, there was\nyour brother here to play propriety, she said. And by the oddest misfortune\nin the world,\" Lord Rokesle sighed, \"I forgot to tell her that Harry\nHeleigh had left Usk a half-hour earlier. My memory is lamentably\ntreacherous.\"\n\nBut Lady Allonby had dropped all affectation. \"You coward! You planned\nthis!\"\n\n\"Candidly, yes. Nangle is my agent as well as Harry's, you may remember.\nI have any quantity of his letters, and of course an equal number\nof Archibald's. So I spent the morning in my own apartments,\nAnastasia,--tracing letters against the window-pane, which was, I suppose,\na childish recreation, but then what would you have? As you very justly\nobserve, country life invariably coarsens a man's tastes; and accordingly,\nas you may now recall, I actually declined a game of _\u00e9cart\u00e9_ with you in\norder to indulge in these little forgeries. Decidedly, my dear, you must\ntrain your husband's imagination for superior flights--when you are Lady\nRokesle.\"\n\nShe was staring at him as though he had been a portent. \"I am alone,\" she\nsaid. \"Alone--in this place--with you! Alone! you devil!\"\n\n\"Your epithets increase in vigor. Just now I was only a clodhopper. Well,\nI can but repeat that it rests with you to make me what you will. Though,\nindeed, you are to all intent alone upon Usk, and upon Usk there are many\ndevils. There are ten of them on guard yonder, by the way, in case your\nbrother should return inopportunely, though that's scarcely probable.\nObedient devils, you observe, Anastasia,--devils who exert and check their\ndeviltry as I bid 'em, for they esteem me Lucifer's lieutenant. And I grant\nthe present situation is an outrage to propriety, yet the evil is not\nincurable. Lady Allonby may not, if she value her reputation, pass to-night\nat Stornoway; but here am I, all willingness, and upstairs is the parson.\nBelieve me, Anastasia, the most vinegarish prude could never object to Lady\nRokesle's spending to-night at Stornoway.\"\n\n\"Let me think, let me think!\" Lady Allonby said, and her hands plucked now\nat her hair, now at her dress. She appeared dazed. \"I can't think!\" she\nwailed on a sudden. \"I am afraid. I--O Vincent, Vincent, you cannot do\nthis thing! I trusted you, Vincent. I know I let you make love to me, and\nI relished having you make love to me. Women are like that. But I cannot\nmarry you, Vincent. There is a man, yonder in England, whom I love. He does\nnot care for me any more,--he is in love with my step-daughter. That is\nvery amusing, is it not, Vincent? Some day I may be his mother-in-law. Why\ndon't you laugh, Vincent? Come, let us both laugh--first at this and then\nat the jest you have just played on me. Do you know, for an instant, I\nbelieved you were in earnest? But Harry went to sleep over the cards,\ndidn't he? And Mrs. Morfit has gone to bed with one of her usual headaches?\nOf course; and you thought you would retaliate upon me for teasing you. You\nwere quite right, 'Twas an excellent jest. Now let us laugh at it. Laugh,\nVincent! Oh!\" she said now, more shrilly, \"for the love of God, laugh,\nlaugh!--or I shall go mad!\"\n\nBut Lord Rokesle was a man of ice, \"Matrimony is a serious matter,\nAnastasia; 'tis not becoming in those who are about to enter it to exhibit\nundue levity. I wonder what's keeping Simon?\"\n\n\"Simon Orts!\" she said, in a half-whisper. Then she came toward Lord\nRokesle, smiling. \"Why, of course, I teased you, Vincent, but there was\nnever any hard feeling, was there? And you really wish me to marry you?\nWell, we must see, Vincent. But, as you say, matrimony is a serious matter.\nD'ye know you say very sensible things, Vincent?--not at all like those\nsilly fops yonder in London. I dare say you and I would be very happy\ntogether. But you wouldn't have any respect for me if I married you on a\nsudden like this, would you? Of course not. So you will let me consider it.\nCome to me a month from now, say,--is that too long to wait? Well, I think\n'tis too long myself. Say a week, then. I must have my wedding-finery,\nyou comprehend. We women are such vain creatures--not big and brave and\nsensible like you men. See, for example, how much bigger your hand is\nthan mine--mine's quite lost in it, isn't it? So--since I am only a vain,\nchattering, helpless female thing,--you are going to indulge me and let me\ngo up to London for some new clothes, aren't you, Vincent? Of course you\nwill; and we will be married in a week. But you will let me go to London\nfirst, won't you?--away from this dreadful place, away--I didn't mean that.\nI suppose it is a very agreeable place when you get accustomed to it. And\n'tis only for clothes--Oh, I swear it is only for clothes, Vincent! And you\nsaid you would--yes, only a moment ago you distinctly said you would let me\ngo. 'Tis not as if I were not coming back--who said I would not come back?\nOf course I will. But you must give me time, Vincent dear,--you must, you\nmust, I tell you! O God!\" she sobbed, and flung from her the loathed hand\nshe was fondling, \"it's no use!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Lord Rokesle, rather sadly. \"I am not Samson, nor are you\nDelilah to cajole me. It's of no use, Anastasia. I would have preferred\nthat you came to me voluntarily, but since you cannot, I mean to take you\nunwilling. Simon,\" he called, loudly, \"does that rascal intend to spin out\nhis dying interminably? Charon's waiting, man.\"\n\nFrom above, \"Coming, my Lord,\" said Simon Orts.\n\n\nIII\n\nThe Vicar of Heriz Magna descended the stairway with deliberation. His\neyes twitched from the sobbing woman to Lord Rokesle, and then back again,\nin that furtive way Orts had of glancing about a room, without moving his\nhead; he seemed to lie in ambush under his gross brows; and whatever his\nthoughts may have been, he gave them no utterance.\n\n\"Simon,\" said Lord Rokesle, \"Lady Allonby is about to make me the happiest\nof men. Have you a prayer-book about you, Master Parson?--for here's a\nloving couple desirous of entering the blessed state of matrimony.\"\n\n\"The match is somewhat of the suddenest,\" said Simon Orts. \"But I have\nknown these impromptu marriages to turn out very happily--very happily,\nindeed.\" he repeated, rubbing his hands together, and smiling horribly. \"I\ngather that Mr. Heleigh will not grace the ceremony with his presence?\"\n\nThey understood each other, these two. Lord Rokesle grinned, and in a few\nwords told the ecclesiastic of the trick which had insured the absence of\nthe other guests; and Simon Orts also grinned, but respectfully,--the grin,\nof the true lackey wearing his master's emotions like his master's clothes,\nat second-hand.\n\n\"A very pretty stratagem,\" said Simon Orts; \"unconventional, I must\nconfess, but it is proverbially known that all's fair in love.\"\n\nAt this Lady Allonby came to him, catching his hand. \"There is only you,\nSimon. Oh, there is no hope in that lustful devil yonder. But you are not\nall base, Simon. You are a man,--ah, God! if I were a man I would rip out\nthat devil's heart--his defiled and infamous heart! I would trample upon\nit, I would feed it to dogs--!\" She paused. Her impotent fury was jerking\nat every muscle, was choking her. \"But I am only a woman. Simon, you used\nto love me. You cannot have forgotten, Simon. Oh, haven't you any pity on a\nwoman? Remember, Simon--remember how happy we were! Don't you remember how\nthe night-jars used to call to one another when we sat on moonlit evenings\nunder the elm-tree? And d'ye remember the cottage we planned, Simon?--where\nwe were going to live on bread and cheese and kisses? And how we quarrelled\nbecause I wanted to train vines over it? You said the rooms would be too\ndark. You said--oh, Simon, Simon! if only I had gone to live with you in\nthat little cottage we planned and never builded!\" Lady Allonby was at his\nfeet now. She fawned upon him in somewhat the manner of a spaniel expectant\nof a thrashing.\n\nThe Vicar of Heriz Magna dispassionately ran over the leaves of his\nprayer-book, till he had found the marriage service, and then closed the\nbook, his forefinger marking the place. Lord Rokesle stood apart, and with\na sly and meditative smile observed them.\n\n\"Your plea is a remarkable one,\" said Simon Orts. \"As I understand it, you\nappeal to me to meddle in your affairs on the ground that you once made\na fool of me. I think the obligation is largely optional. I remember\nquite clearly the incidents to which you refer; and it shames even an\nold sot like me to think that I was ever so utterly at the mercy of a\ngood-for-nothing jilt. I remember every vow you ever made to me, Anastasia,\nand I know they were all lies. I remember every kiss, every glance, every\ncaress--all lies, Anastasia! And gad! the only emotion it rouses in me is\nwonder as to why my worthy patron here should want to marry you. Of course\nyou are wealthy, but, personally, I would not have you for double the\nmoney. I must ask you to rise, Lady Rokesle.--Pardon me if I somewhat\nanticipate your title.\"\n\nLady Allonby stumbled to her feet. \"Is there no manhood in the world?\" she\nasked, with a puzzled voice. \"Has neither of you ever heard of manhood,\nthough but as distantly as men hear summer thunder? Had neither of you a\nwoman for a mother--a woman, as I am--or a father who was not--O God!--not\nas you are?\"\n\n\"These rhetorical passages,\" said Lord Rokesle, \"while very elegantly\nexpressed, are scarcely to the point. So you and Simon went a-philandering\nonce? Egad, that lends quite a touch of romance to the affair. But\ndespatch, Parson Simon,--your lady's for your betters now.\"\n\n\"Dearly beloved,--\" said Simon Orts.\n\n\"Simon, you are not all base. I am helpless, Simon, utterly helpless. There\nwas a Simon once would not have seen me weep. There was a Simon--\"\n\n\"--we are gathered together here in the sight of God--\"\n\n\"You cannot do it, Simon,--do I not know you to the marrow? Remember--not\nme--not the vain folly of my girlhood!--but do you remember the man you\nhave been, Simon Orts!\" Fiercely Lady Allonby caught him by the shoulder.\n\"For you do remember! You do remember, don't you, Simon?\"\n\nThe Vicar stared at her. \"The man I have been,\" said Simon Orts, \"yes!--the\nman I have been!\" Something clicked in his throat with sharp distinctness.\n\n\"Upon my word,\" said Lord Rokesle, yawning, \"this getting married appears\nto be an uncommonly tedious business.\"\n\nThen Simon Orts laid aside his prayer-book and said: \"I cannot do it, my\nLord. The woman's right.\"\n\nShe clapped her hands to her breast, and stood thus, reeling upon her\nfeet. You would have thought her in the crisis of some physical agony;\nimmediately she breathed again, deeply but with a flinching inhalation, as\nthough the contact of the air scorched her lungs, and, swaying, fell. It\nwas the Vicar who caught her as she fell.\n\n\"I entreat your pardon?\" said Lord Rokesle, and without study of Lady\nAllonby's condition. This was men's business now, and over it Rokesle's\nbrow began to pucker.\n\nSimon Orts bore Lady Allonby to the settie. He passed behind it to arrange\na cushion under her head, with an awkward, grudging tenderness; and then\nrose to face Lord Rokesle across the disordered pink fripperies.\n\n\"The woman's right, my Lord. There is such a thing as manhood. Manhood!\"\nSimon Orts repeated, with a sort of wonder; \"why, I might have boasted it\nonce. Then came this cuddling bitch to trick me into a fool's paradise--to\ntrick me into utter happiness, till Stephen Allonby, a marquis' son,\nclapped eyes on her and whistled,--and within the moment she had flung me\naside. May God forgive me, I forgot I was His servant then! I set out to go\nto the devil, but I went farther; for I went to you, Vincent Floyer. You\ngave me bread when I was starving,--but 'twas at a price. Ay, the price was\nthat I dance attendance on you, to aid and applaud your knaveries, to be\nyour pander, your lackey, your confederate,--that I puff out, in effect,\nthe last spark of manhood in my sot's body. Oh, I am indeed beholden to you\ntwo! to her for making me a sot, and to you for making me a lackey. But I\nwill save her from you, Vincent Floyer. Not for her sake\"--Orts looked down\nupon the prostrate woman and snarled. \"Christ, no! But I'll do it for the\nsake of the boy I have been, since I owe that boy some reparation. I have\nruined his nimble body, I have dulled the wits he gloried in, I have made\nhis name a foul thing that honesty spits out of her mouth; but, if God yet\nreigns in heaven, I cleanse that name to-night!\"\n\n\"Oh, bless me,\" Lord Rokesle observed; \"I begin to fear these heroics are\ncontagious. Possibly I, too, shall begin to rant in a moment. Meanwhile, as\nI understand it, you decline to perform the ceremony. I have had to warn\nyou before this, Simon, that you mustn't take too much gin when I am apt\nto need you. You are very pitifully drunk, man. So you defy me and my evil\ncourses! You defy me!\" Rokesle laughed, genially, for the notion amused\nhim. \"Wine is a mocker, Simon. But come, despatch, Parson Tosspot, and\nlet's have no more of these lofty sentiments.\"\n\n\"I cannot do it. I--O my Lord, my Lord! You wouldn't kill an unarmed man!\"\nSimon Orts whined, with a sudden alteration of tone; for Lord Rokesle had\ncomposedly drawn his sword, and its point was now not far from the Vicar's\nbreast.\n\n\"I trust that I shall not be compelled to. Egad, it is a very ludicrous\nbusiness when the bridegroom is forced to hold a sword to the parson's\nbosom all during the ceremony; but a ceremony we must have, Simon, for Lady\nAllonby's jointure is considerable. Otherwise--Harkee, my man, don't play\nthe fool! there are my fellows yonder, any one of whom would twist your\nneck at a word from me. And do you think I would boggle at a word? Gad,\nSimon, I believed you knew me better!\"\n\nThe Vicar of Heriz Magna kept silence for an instant; his eyes were\ntwitching about the hall, in that stealthy way of his. Finally, \"It is\nno use,\" said he. \"A poor knave cannot afford the luxury of honesty. My\nlife is not a valuable one, perhaps, but even vermin have an aversion to\ndeath. I resume my lackeyship, Lord Rokesle. Perhaps 'twas only the gin.\nPerhaps--In any event, I am once more at your service. And as guaranty of\nthis I warn you that you are exhibiting in the affair scant forethought.\nMr. Heleigh is but three miles distant. If he, by any chance, get wind of\nthis business, Denstroude will find a boat for him readily enough--ay, and\nmen, too, now that the Colonel is at feud with you. Many of your people\nvisit the mainland every night, and in their cups the inhabitants of Usk\nare not taciturn. An idle word spoken over an inn-table may bring an armed\ncompany thundering about your gates. You should have set sentinels, my\nLord.\"\n\n\"I have already done so,\" Rokesle said; \"there are ten of 'em yonder. Still\nthere is something in what you say. We will make this affair certain.\"\n\nLord Rokesle crossed the hall to the foot of the stairway and struck thrice\nupon the gong hanging there. Presently the door leading to the corridor was\nopened, and a man came into the hall.\n\n\"Punshon,\" said Lord Rokesle, \"have any boats left the island to-night?\"\n\n\"No, my Lord.\"\n\n\"You will see that none do. Also, no man is to leave Stornoway to-night,\neither for Heriz Magna or the mainland; and nobody is to enter Stornoway.\nDo you understand, Punshon?\"\n\n\"Yes, my Lord.\"\n\n\"If you will pardon me,\" said Simon Orts, with a grin, \"I have an\nappointment to-night. You'd not have me break faith with a lady?\"\n\n\"You are a lecherous rascal, Simon. But do as you are bid and I indulge\nyou. I am not afraid of your going to Harry Heleigh--after performing the\nceremony. Nay, my lad, for you are thereby _particeps criminis_. You will\npass Mr. Orts, Punshon, to the embraces of his whore. Nobody else.\"\n\nSimon Orts waved his hand toward Lady Allonby. \"'Twere only kindness to\nwarn Mr. Punshon there may be some disturbance shortly. A lamentation or\nso.\"\n\nAt this Lord Rokesle clapped him upon the shoulder and heartily laughed.\n\"That's the old Simon--always on the alert. Punshon, no one is to enter\nthis wing of the castle, on any pretext--no one, you understand. Whatever\nnoises you may hear, you will pay no attention. Now go.\"\n\nHe went toward Lady Allonby and took her hand. \"Come, Anastasia!\" said he.\n\"Hold, she has really swooned! Why, what the devil, Simon--!\"\n\nSimon Orts had flung the gong into the fire. \"She will be sounding that\nwhen she comes to,\" said Simon Orts. \"You don't want a rumpus fit to vex\nthe dead yonder in the Chapel.\" Simon Orts stood before the fire, turning\nthe leaves of his prayer-book. He seemed to have difficulty in finding\nagain the marriage service. You heard the outer door of the corridor\nclosing, heard chains dragged ponderously, the heavy falling of a bolt.\nOrts dropped the book and, springing into the arm-chair, wrested Aluric\nFloyer's sword from its fastening. \"Tricked, tricked!\" said Simon Orts.\n\"You were always a fool, Vincent Floyer.\"\n\nLord Rokesle blinked at him, as if dazzled by unexpected light. \"What d'ye\nmean?\"\n\n\"I have the honor to repeat--you are a fool, I did not know the place was\nguarded--you told me. I needed privacy; by your orders no one is to enter\nhere to-night. I needed a sword--you had it hanging here, ready for the\nfirst comer. Oh, beyond doubt, you are a fool, Vincent Floyer!\" Standing\nin the arm-chair, Simon Orts bowed fantastically, and then leaped to the\nground with the agility of an imp.\n\n\"You have tricked me neatly,\" Lord Rokesle conceded, and his tone did not\nlack honest admiration. \"By gad, I have even given them orders to pass\nyou--after you have murdered me! Exceedingly clever, Simon,--but one thing\nyou overlooked. You are very far from my match at fencing. So I shall\npresently kill you. And afterward, ceremony or no ceremony, the woman's\nmine.\"\n\n\"I am not convinced of that,\" the Vicar observed. \"'Tis true I am no\nswordsman; but there are behind my sword forces superior to any which\nskill might muster. The sword of your fathers fights against you, my\nLord--against you that are their disgrace. They loved honor and truth; you\nbetrayed honor, you knew not truth. They revered womanhood; you reverence\nnothing, and your life smirches your mother's memory. Ah, believe me,\nthey all fight against you! Can you not see them, my Lord?--yonder at my\nback?--old Aluric Floyer and all those honest gentlemen, whose blood now\nblushes in your body--ay, blushes to be confined in a vessel so ignoble!\nTheir armament fights against you, a host of gallant phantoms. And my\nhatred, too, fights against you--the cur's bitter hatred for the mastering\nhand it dares not bite. I dare now. You made me your pander, you slew my\nmanhood; in return, body and soul, I demolish you. Even my hatred for that\nwoman fights against you; she robbed me of my honor--is it not a tragical\nrevenge to save her honor, to hold it in my hand, mine, to dispose of as\nI elect,--and then fling it to her as a thing contemptible? Between you,\nyou have ruined me; but it is Simon's hour to-night. I shame you both, and\npast the reach of thought, for presently I shall take your life--in the\nhigh-tide of your iniquity, praise God!--and presently I shall give my life\nfor hers. Ah, I a fey, my Lord! You are a dead man, Vincent Floyer, for the\npowers of good and the powers of evil alike contend against you.\"\n\nHe spoke rather sadly than otherwise; and there was a vague trouble in Lord\nRokesle's face, though he shook his head impatiently. \"These are fine words\nto come from the dirtiest knave unhanged in England.\"\n\n\"Great ends may be attained by petty instruments, my Lord; a filthy turtle\nquenched the genius of \u00c6schylus, and they were only common soldiers who\nshed the blood that redeemed the world.\"\n\nLord Rokesle pished at this. Yet he was strangely unruffled. He saluted\nwith quietude, as equal to equal, and the two crossed blades.\n\nSimon Orts fought clumsily, but his encroachment was unwavering. From the\nfirst he pressed his opponent with a contained resolution. The Vicar was\nas a man fighting in a dream--with a drugged obstinacy, unswerving. Lord\nRokesle had wounded him in the arm, but Orts did not seem aware of this.\nHe crowded upon his master. Now there were little beads of sweat on Lord\nRokesle's brow, and his tongue protruded from his mouth, licking at it\nravenously. Step by step Lord Rokesle drew back; there was no withstanding\nthis dumb fanatic, who did not know when he was wounded, who scarcely\nparried attack.\n\n\"Even on earth you shall have a taste of hell,\" said Simon Orts. \"There is\nterror in your eyes, my worthy patron.\"\n\nLord Rokesle flung up his arms as the sword dug into his breast. \"I am\nafraid! I am afraid!\" he wailed. Then he coughed, and seemed with his\nstraining hands to push a great weight from him as the blood frothed about\nhis lips and nostrils. \"O Simon, I am afraid! Help me, Simon!\"\n\nOld custom spoke there. Followed silence, and presently the empty body\nsprawled upon the floor. Vincent Floyer had done with it.\n\n\nIV\n\nSimon Orts knelt, abstractedly wiping Aluric Floyer's sword upon the corner\nof a rug. It may be that he derived comfort from this manual employment\nwhich necessitated attention without demanding that it concentrate his\nmind; it may have enabled him to forget how solitary the place was, how\nviciously his garments rustled when he moved: the fact is certain that he\ncleaned the sword, over and over again.\n\nThen a scraping of silks made him wince. Turning, he found Lady Allonby\nhalf-erect upon the settle. She stared about her with a kind of Infantile\nwonder; her glance swept, over Lord Rokesle's body, without to all\nappearance finding it an object of remarkable interest. \"Is he dead?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Simon Orts; \"get up!\" His voice had a rasp; she might from his\ntone have been a refractory dog. But Lady Allonby obeyed him.\n\n\"We are in a devil of a mess,\" said Simon Orts; \"yet I see a way out of\nit--if you can keep your head. Can you?\"\n\n\"I am past fear,\" she said, dully. \"I drown, Simon, in a sea of feathers. I\ncan get no foothold, I clutch nothing that is steadfast, and I smother. I\nhave been like this in dreams. I am very tired, Simon.\"\n\nHe took her hand, collectedly appraising her pulse. He put his own hand\nupon her bared bosom, and felt the beat of her heart. \"No,\" said Simon\nOrts, \"you are not afraid. Now, listen: You lack time to drown in a sea of\nfeathers. You are upon Usk, among men who differ from beasts by being a\nthought more devilish, and from devils by being a little more bestial; it\nis my opinion that the earlier you get away the better. Punshon has orders\nto pass Simon Orts. Very well; put on this.\"\n\nHe caught up his long cloak and wrapped it about her. Lady Allonby stood\nrigid. But immediately he frowned and removed the garment from her\nshoulders.\n\n\"That won't do. Your skirts are too big. Take 'em off.\"\n\nSubmissively she did so, and presently stood before him in her\nunder-petticoat.\n\n\"You cut just now a very ludicrous figure, Anastasia. I dare assert that\nthe nobleman who formerly inhabited yonder carcass would still be its\ntenant if he had known how greatly the beauty he went mad for was beholden\nto the haberdasher and the mantua-maker, and quite possibly the chemist.\n_Persicos odi_, Anastasia; 'tis a humiliating reflection that the hair of a\ndead woman artfully disposed about a living head should have the power\nto set men squabbling, and murder be at times engendered in a paint-pot.\nHowever, wrap yourself in the cloak. Now turn up the collar,--so. Now pull\ndown the hatbrim. Um--a--pretty well. Chance favors us unblushingly. You\nmay thank your stars it is a rainy night and that I am a little man. You\ndetest little men, don't you? Yes, I remember.\" Simon Orts now gave his\norders, emphasizing each with a not over-clean forefinger. \"When I open\nthis door you will go out into the corridor. Punshon or one of the others\nwill be on guard at the farther end. Pay no attention to him. There is\nonly one light--on the left. Keep to the right, in the shadow. Stagger as\nyou go; if you can manage a hiccough, the imitation will be all the more\nlifelike. Punshon will expect something of the sort, and he will not\ntrouble you, for he knows that when I am fuddled I am quarrelsome. 'Tis a\ndiverting world, Anastasia, wherein, you now perceive, habitual drunkenness\nand an unbridled temper may sometimes prove commendable,--as they do\nto-night, when they aid persecuted innocence!\" Here Simon Orts gave an\nunpleasant laugh.\n\n\"But I do not understand--\"\n\n\"You understand very little except coquetry and the proper disposition\nof a ruffle. Yet this is simple. My horse is tied at the postern.\nMount--astride, mind. You know the way to the Vicarage, so does the horse;\nyou will find that posturing half-brother of mine at the Vicarage. Tell\nFrank what has happened. Tell him to row you to the mainland; tell him to\nconduct you to Colonel Denstroude's. Then you must shift for yourself; but\nDenstroude is a gentleman, and Denstroude would protect Beelzebub if he\ncame to him a fugitive from Vincent Floyer. Now do you understand?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lady Allonby, and seated herself before the fire,--\"yes, I\nunderstand. I am to slip away in the darkness and leave you here to answer\nfor Lord Rokesle's death--to those devils. La, do you really think me as\nbase as that?\"\n\nNow Simon Orts was kneeling at her side. The black cloak enveloped her from\nhead to foot, and the turned-up collar screened her sunny hair; in the\nshadow of the broad hatbrim you could see only her eyes, resplendent and\ndefiant, and in them the reflection of the vaulting flames. \"You would\nstay, Anastasia?\"\n\n\"I will not purchase my life at the cost of yours. I will be indebted to\nyou for nothing, Simon Orts.\"\n\nThe Vicar chuckled. \"Nor appeared Less than archangel ruined,\" he said.\n\"No, faith, not a whit less! We are much of a piece, Anastasia. Do you\nknow--if affairs had fallen out differently--I think I might have been a\nman and you a woman? As it is--\" Kneeling still, his glance devoured her.\n\"Yes, you would stay. And you comprehend what staying signifies. 'Tis\npride, your damnable pride, that moves you,--but I rejoice, for it proves\nyou a brave woman. Courage, at least, you possess, and this is the first\nvirtue I have discovered in you for a long while. However, there is no\nnecessity for your staying. The men of Usk will not hurt Simon Orts.\"\n\nShe was very eager to believe this. Lady Allonby had found the world a\npleasant place since her widowhood. \"They will not kill you? You swear it,\nSimon?\"\n\n\"Why, the man was their tyrant. They obeyed him--yes, through fear. I am\ntheir deliverer, Anastasia. But if they found a woman here--a woman not\nill-looking--\" Simon Orts snapped his fingers. \"Faith, I leave you to\nconjecture,\" said he.\n\nThey had both risen, he smiling, the woman in a turbulence of hope and\nterror. \"Swear to it, Simon!\"\n\n\"Anastasia, were affairs as you suppose them, I would have a curt while to\nlive. Were affairs as you suppose them, I would stand now at the threshold\nof eternity. And I swear to you, upon my soul's salvation, that I have\nnothing to fear. Nothing will ever hurt me any more.\"\n\n\"No, you would not dare to lie in the moment of death,\" she said, after\na considerable pause. \"I believe you. I will go. Good-bye, Simon.\" Lady\nAllonby went toward the door opening into the corridor, but turned there\nand came back to him. \"I shall never see you again. And, la, I think that\nI rather hate you than otherwise, for you remind me of things I would\nwillingly forget. But, Simon, I wish we had gone to live in that little\ncottage we planned, and quarrelled over, and never built! I think we would\nhave been happy.\"\n\nSimon Orts raised her hand to his lips. \"Yes,\" said he, \"we would have been\nhappy. I would have been by this a man doing a man's work in the world, and\nyou a matron, grizzling, perhaps, but rich in content, and in love opulent.\nAs it is, you have your flatterers, your gossip, and your cards; I have my\ngin. Good-bye, Anastasia.\"\n\n\"Simon, why have you done--this?\"\n\nThe Vicar of Heriz Magna flung out his hands in a gesture of impotence. \"I\ndare confess now that which even to myself I have never dared confess. I\nsuppose the truth of it is that I have loved you all my life.\"\n\n\"I am sorry. I am not worth it, Simon.\"\n\n\"No; you are immeasurably far from being worth it. But one does not justify\nthese fancies by mathematics. Good-bye, Anastasia.\"\n\n\nV\n\nHolding the door ajar, the Vicar of Heriz Magna heard a horse's hoofs slap\ntheir leisurely way down the hillside. Presently the sound died and he\nturned back into the hall.\n\n\"A brave woman, that! Oh, a trifling, shallow-hearted jilt, but a brave\ncreature!\n\n\"I had to lie to her. She would have stayed else. And perhaps it is true\nthat, in reality, I have loved her all my life,--or in any event, have\nhankered after the pink-and-white flesh of her as any gentleman might.\nPschutt! a pox on all lechery says the dying man,--since it is now\nnecessary to put that strapping yellow-haired trollop out of your mind,\nSimon Orts--yes, after all these years, to put her quite out of your mind.\nFaith, she might wheedle me now to her heart's content, and my pulse would\nnever budge; for I must devote what trivial time there is to hoping they\nwill kill me quickly. He was their god, that man!\"\n\nSimon Orts went toward the dead body, looking down into the distorted face.\n\"And I, too, loved him. Yes, such as he was, he was the only friend I\nhad. And I think he liked me,\" Simon Orts said aloud, with a touch of shy\npride. \"Yes, and you trusted me, didn't you, Vincent? Wait for me, then,\nmy Lord,--I shall not be long. And now I'll serve you faithfully. I had to\nplay the man's part, you know,--you mustn't grudge old Simon his one hour\nof manhood. You wouldn't, I think. And in any event, I shall be with you\npresently, and you can cuff me for it if you like--just as you used to do.\"\n\nHe covered the dead face with his handkerchief, but in the instant he drew\nit away. \"No, not this coarse cambric. You were too much of a fop, Vincent.\nI will use yours--the finest linen, my Lord. You see old Simon knows your\ntastes.\"\n\nHe drew himself erect exultantly.\n\n\"They will come at dawn to kill me; but I have had my hour. God, the man I\nmight have been! And now--well, perhaps He would not be offended if I said\na bit of a prayer for Vincent.\"\n\nSo the Vicar of Heriz Magna knelt beside the flesh that had been Lord\nRokesle, and there they found him in the morning.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nLOVE AT MARTINMAS\n_As Played at Tunbridge Wells, April 1, 1750_\n\n    \"_He to love an altar built\n  Of twelve vast French romances, neatly gilt.\n  There lay three garters, half a pair of gloves,\n  And all the trophies of his former loves;\n  With tender billet-doux he lights the pyre,\n  And breathes three amorous sighs to raise the fire;\n  Then prostrate falls, and begs with ardent eyes\n  Soon to obtain, and long possess the prize._\"\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6\n\nMR. ERWYN, a gentleman of the town, ceremonious and a\n    coxcomb, but a man of honor.\nLADY ALLONBY, a woman of fashion, and widow to\n    Lord Stephen Allonby.\nMISS ALLONBY, daughter to Lord Stephen by a former\n    marriage, of a considerable fortune in her own hands.\nFOOTMEN to Lady Allonby; and in the Proem FRANCIS\n    ORTS, commonly know as FRANCIS VANBINGHAM, a\n    dissolute play-actor.\n\n\nSCENE\n\nA drawing-room In Lady Allonby's villa at Tunbridge Wells.\n\n\nLOVE AT MARTINMAS\n\n\n_PROEM:--To be Filed for Reference Hereafter_\n\nLady Allonby followed in all respects the Vicar's instructions; and\nmidnight found her upon the pier of Bishops Onslow, Colonel Denstroude's\nbig and dilapidated country-residence. Frank Orts had assisted her from the\nrowboat without speaking; indeed, he had uttered scarcely a word, save to\nissue some necessary direction, since the woman first came to him at the\nVicarage with her news of the night's events. Now he composedly stepped\nback into the boat.\n\n\"You've only to go forward,\" said Frank Orts. \"I regret that for my own\npart I'm no longer an acceptable visitor here, since the Colonel and I\nfought last summer over one Molly Yates. Nay, I beseech you, put up your\npurse, my Lady.\"\n\n\"Then I can but render you my heartfelt thanks,\" replied Lady Allonby, \"and\nincessantly remember you in daily prayers for the two gallant men who have\nthis night saved a woman from great misery. Yet there is that in your voice\nwhich is curiously familiar, Mr. Orts, and I think that somewhere you and I\nhave met before this.\"\n\n\"Ay,\" he responded, \"you have squandered many a shilling on me here in\nEngland, where Francis Vanringham bellows and makes faces with the rest of\nthe Globe Company. On Usk, you understand, I'm still Frank Orts, just as I\nwas christened; but elsewhere the name of Vanringham was long ago esteemed\nmore apt to embellish and adorn the bill of a heroic play. Ay, you've been\npleased to applaud my grimaces behind the footlights, more than once; your\nmother-in-law, indeed, the revered Marchioness-Dowager of Falmouth, is\namong my staunchest patrons.\"\n\n\"Heavens! then we shall all again see one another at Tunbridge!\" said Lady\nAllonby, who was recovering her spirits; \"and I shall have a Heaven-sent\nopportunity, to confirm my protestations that I am not ungrateful. Mr.\nVanringham, I explicitly command you to open in _The Orphan_, since: as\nCastalio in that piece you are the most elegant and moving thing in the\nuniversal world.\" [Footnote: This was the opinion of others as well.\nThorsby (_Roscius Anglicanus_) says, \"Mr. Vanringham was good in tragedy,\nas well as in comedy, especially as Castalio in Otway's _Orphan_, and the\nmore famous Garrick came, in that part, far short of him.\" Vanringham was\nalso noted for his Valentine in _Love for Love_ and for his Beaugard in\n_The Soldier's Fortune_.]\n\n\"Your command shall be obeyed,\" said the actor. \"And meantime, my Lady,\nI bid you an _au revoir_, with many millions of regrets for the\ninconveniences to which you've been subjected this evening, Oho, we are\nlamentably rustic hereabout.\"\n\nAnd afterward as he rowed through the dark the man gave a grunt of\ndissatisfaction.\n\n\"I was too abrupt with her. But it vexes me to have Brother Simon butchered\nlike this.... These natural instincts are damnably inconvenient,--and\nexpensive, at times, Mr. Vanringham,--beside being ruinous to one's sense\nof humor, Mr. Vanringham. Why, to think that she alone should go scot-free!\nand of her ordering a stage-box within the hour of two men's destruction\non her account! Upon reflection, I admire the woman to the very tips of my\ntoes. Eh, well! I trust to have need of her gratitude before the month is\nup.\"\n\n\nI\n\nSince Colonel Denstroude proved a profane and dissolute and helpful person,\nLady Allonby was shortly re-established in her villa at Tunbridge Wells, on\nthe Sussex side, where she had resolved to find a breathing-space prior to\nthe full season in London. And thereupon she put all thoughts of Usk quite\nout of her mind: it had been an unhappy business, but it was over. In the\nmeanwhile her wardrobe needed replenishing now that spring was coming\nin; the company at the Wells was gay enough; and Lady Allonby had always\nsedulously avoided anything that was disagreeable.\n\nMr. Erwyn Lady Allonby was far from cataloguing under that head. Mr. George\nErwyn had been for years a major-general, at the very least, in Fashion's\narmy, and was concededly a connoisseur of all the elegancies.\n\nMr. Erwyn sighed as he ended his recital--half for pity of the misguided\nfolk who had afforded Tunbridge its latest scandal, half for relief that,\nin spite of many difficulties, the story had been set forth in discreet\nlanguage which veiled, without at all causing you to miss, the more\nunsavory details.\n\n\"And so,\" said he, \"poor Harry is run through the lungs, and Mrs.\nAnstruther has recovered her shape and is to be allowed a separate\nmaintenance.\"\n\n\"'Tis shocking!\" said Lady Allonby.\n\n\"'Tis incredible,\" said Mr. Erwyn, \"to my mind, at least, that the bonds of\nmatrimony should be slipped thus lightly. But the age is somewhat lax and\nthe world now views with complaisance the mad antics of half-grown lads and\nwenches who trip toward the altar as carelessly as if the partnership were\nfor a country-dance.\"\n\nLady Allonby stirred her tea and said nothing. Notoriously her marriage had\nbeen unhappy; and her two years of widowhood (dating from the unlamented\nseizure, brought on by an inherited tendency to apoplexy and French\nbrandy, which carried off Lord Stephen Allonby of Prestonwoode) had to all\nappearance never tempered her distrust of the matrimonial state. Certain it\nwas that she had refused many advantageous offers during this period, for\nher jointure was considerable, and, though in candid moments she confessed\nto thirty-three, her dearest friends could not question Lady Allonby's\ngood looks. She was used to say that she would never re-marry, because she\ndesired to devote herself to her step-daughter, but, as gossip had it at\nTunbridge, she was soon to be deprived of this subterfuge; for Miss Allonby\nhad reached her twentieth year, and was nowadays rarely seen in public save\nin the company of Mr. Erwyn, who, it was generally conceded, stood high in\nthe girl's favor and was desirous of rounding off his career as a leader of\nfashion with the approved comoedic _d\u00e9nouement_ of marriage with a young\nheiress.\n\nFor these reasons Lady Allonby heard with interest his feeling allusion to\nthe laxity of the age, and through a moment pondered thereon, for it seemed\nnow tolerably apparent that Mr. Erwyn had lingered, after the departure of\nher other guests, in order to make a disclosure which Tunbridge had for\nmany months expected.\n\n\"I had not thought,\" said she, at length, \"that you, of all men, would ever\ncast a serious eye toward marriage. Indeed, Mr. Erwyn, you have loved women\nso long that I must dispute your ability to love a woman--and your amours\nhave been a byword these twenty years.\"\n\n\"Dear lady,\" said Mr. Erwyn, \"surely you would not confound amour with\nlove? Believe me, the translation is inadequate. Amour is but the summer\nwave that lifts and glitters and laughs in the sunlight, and within the\ninstant disappears; but love is the unfathomed eternal sea itself. Or--to\nshift the metaphor--Amour is a general under whom youth must serve:\nCuriosity and Lustiness are his recruiting officers, and it is well to\nfight under his colors, for it is against Ennui that he marshals his\nforces. 'Tis a resplendent conflict, and young blood cannot but stir and\nexult as paradoxes, marching and countermarching at the command of their\ngay generalissimo, make way for one another in iridescent squadrons, while\nthrough the steady musketry of epigram one hears the clash of contending\nrepartees, or the cry of a wailing sonnet. But this lord of laughter may be\nserved by the young alone; and by and by each veteran--scarred, it may be,\nbut not maimed, dear lady--is well content to relinquish the glory and\nadventure of such colorful campaigns for some quiet inglenook, where, with\nlove to make a third, he prattles of past days and deeds with one that goes\nhand in hand with him toward the tomb.\"\n\nLady Allonby accorded this conceit the tribute of a sigh; then glanced,\nin the direction of four impassive footmen to make sure they were out of\nearshot.\n\n\"And so--?\" said she.\n\n\"Split me!\" said Mr. Erwyn, \"I thought you had noted it long ago.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" she observed, reflectively, \"I suppose it is quite time.\"\n\n\"I am not,\" said Mr. Erwyn, \"in the heyday of my youth, I grant you; but\nI am not for that reason necessarily unmoved by the attractions of an\nadvantageous person, a fine sensibility and all the graces.\"\n\nHe sipped his tea with an air of resentment; and Lady Allonby, in view of\nthe disparity of age which existed between Mr. Erwyn and her step-daughter,\nhad cause to feel that she had blundered into _gaucherie_; and to await\nwith contrition the proposal for her step-daughter's hand that the man was\n(at last) about to broach to her, as the head of the family.\n\n\"Who is she?\" said Lady Allonby, all friendly interest.\n\n\"An angel,\" said Mr. Erwyn, fencing.\n\n\"Beware,\" Lady Allonby exhorted, \"lest she prove a recording angel; a wife\nwho takes too deep an interest in your movements will scarcely suit you.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am assured,\" said Mr. Erwyn, smiling, \"that on Saturdays she will\nallow me the customary half-holiday.\"\n\nLady Allonby, rebuffed, sought consolation among the conserves.\n\n\"Yet, as postscript,\" said Mr. Erwyn, \"I do not desire a wife who will\ntake her morning chocolate with me and sup with Heaven knows whom. I have\nseen, too much of _mariage \u00e0 la mode_, and I come to her, if not with the\ntransports of an Amadis, at least with an entire affection and respect.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Lady Allonby, \"you love this woman?\"\n\n\"Very tenderly,\" said Mr. Erwyn; \"and, indeed, I would, for her sake, that\nthe errors of my past life were not so numerous, nor the frailty of my\naspiring resolutions rendered apparent--ah, so many times!--to a gaping\nand censorious world. For, as you are aware, I cannot offer her an untried\nheart; 'tis somewhat worn by many barterings. But I know that this heart\nbeats with accentuation in her presence; and when I come to her some day\nand clasp her in my arms, as I aspire to do, I trust that her lips may not\nturn away from mine and that she may be more glad because I am so near and\nthat her stainless heart may sound an echoing chime. For, with a great and\ntroubled adoration, I love her as I have loved no other woman; and this\nmuch, I submit, you cannot doubt.\"\n\n\"I?\" said Lady Allonby, with extreme innocence. \"La, how should I know?\"\n\n\"Unless you are blind,\" Mr. Erwyn observed--\"and I apprehend those spacious\nshining eyes to be more keen than the tongue of a dowager,--you must have\nseen of late that I have presumed to hope--to think--that she whom I love\nso tenderly might deign to be the affectionate, the condescending friend\nwho would assist me to retrieve the indiscretions of my youth--\"\n\nThe confusion of his utterance, his approach to positive agitation as he\nwaved his teaspoon, moved Lady Allonby. \"It is true,\" she said, \"that I\nhave not been wholly blind--\"\n\n\"Anastasia,\" said Mr. Erwyn, with yet more feeling, \"is not our friendship\nof an age to justify sincerity?\"\n\n\"Oh, bless me, you toad! but let us not talk of things that happened\nunder the Tudors. Well, I have not been unreasonably blind,--and I do not\nobject,--and I do not believe that Dorothy will prove obdurate.\"\n\n\"You render me the happiest of men,\" Mr. Erwyn stated, rapturously. \"You\nhave, then, already discussed this matter with Miss Allonby?\"\n\n\"Not precisely,\" said she, laughing; \"since I had thought it apparent to\nthe most timid lover that the first announcement came with best grace from\nhim.\"\n\n\"O' my conscience, then, I shall be a veritable Demosthenes,\" said Mr.\nErwyn, laughing likewise; \"and in common decency she will consent.\"\n\n\"Your conceit.\" said Lady Allonby, \"is appalling.\"\n\n\"'Tis beyond conception,\" Mr. Erwyn admitted; \"and I propose to try\nmarriage as a remedy. I have heard that nothing so takes down a man.\"\n\n\"Impertinent!\" cried Lady Allonby; \"now of whatever can the creature be\ntalking!\"\n\n\"I mean that, as your widowship well knows, marrying puts a man in his\nproper place. And that the outcome is salutary for proud, puffed-up fellows\nI would be the last to dispute. Indeed, I incline to dispute nothing, for I\nfind that perfect felicity is more potent than wine. I am now all pastoral\nraptures, and were it not for the footmen there, I do not know to what\nlengths I might go.\"\n\n\"In that event,\" Lady Allonby decided, \"I shall fetch Dorothy, that the\ncrown may be set upon your well-being. And previously I will dismiss the\nfootmen.\" She did so with a sign toward those lordly beings.\n\n\"Believe me,\" said Mr. Erwyn, \"'tis what I have long wished for. And\nwhen Miss Allonby honors me with her attention I shall, since my life's\nhappiness depends upon the issue, plead with all the eloquence of a\nstarveling barrister, big with the import of his first case. May I, indeed,\nrest assured that any triumph over her possible objections may be viewed\nwith not unfavorable eyes?\"\n\n\"O sir,\" said Lady Allonby, \"believe me, there is nothing I more earnestly\ndesire than that you may obtain all which is necessary for your welfare. I\nwill fetch Dorothy.\"\n\nThe largest footman but one removed Mr. Erwyn's cup.\n\n\nII\n\nMr. Erwyn, left alone, smiled at his own reflection in the mirror;\nrearranged his ruffles with a deft and shapely hand; consulted his watch;\nmade sure that the padding which enhanced the calves of his most notable\nlegs was all as it should be; seated himself and hummed a merry air, in\nmeditative wise; and was in such posture when the crimson hangings that\nshielded the hall-door quivered and broke into tumultuous waves and yielded\nup Miss Dorothy Allonby.\n\nBeing an heiress, Miss Allonby was by an ancient custom brevetted a great\nbeauty; and it is equitable to add that the sourest misogynist could hardly\nhave refused, pointblank, to countersign the commission. They said of\nDorothy Allonby that her eyes were as large as her bank account, and nearly\nas formidable as her tongue; and it is undeniable that on provocation there\nwas in her speech a tang of acidity, such (let us say) as renders a salad\nnone the less palatable. In a word, Miss Allonby pitied the limitations of\nmasculine humanity more readily than its amorous pangs, and cuddled her\nwomen friends as she did kittens, with a wary and candid apprehension of\ntheir power to scratch; and decision was her key-note; continually she knew\nto the quarter-width of a cobweb what she wanted, and invariably she got\nit.\n\nSuch was the person who, with a habitual emphasis which dowagers found\nhoydenish and all young men adorable, demanded without prelude:\n\n\"Heavens! What can it be, Mr. Erwyn, that has cast Mother into this\nunprecedented state of excitement?\"\n\n\"What, indeed?\" said he, and bowed above her proffered hand.\n\n\"For like a hurricane, she burst into my room and cried, 'Mr. Erwyn\nhas something of importance to declare to you--why did you put on that\ngown?--bless you, my child--' all in one eager breath; then kissed me, and\npowdered my nose, and despatched me to you without any explanation. And\nwhy?\" said Miss Allonby.\n\n\"Why, indeed?\" said Mr. Erwyn.\n\n\"It is very annoying,\" said she, decisively.\n\n\"Sending you to me?\" said Mr. Erwyn, a magnitude of reproach in his voice.\n\n\"That,\" said Miss Allonby, \"I can pardon--and easily. But I dislike all\nmysteries, and being termed a child, and being--\"\n\n\"Yes?\" said Mr. Erwyn.\n\n\"--and being powdered on the nose,\" said Miss Allonby, with firmness. She\nwent to the mirror, and, standing on the tips of her toes, peered anxiously\ninto its depths. She rubbed her nose, as if in disapproval, and frowned,\nperhaps involuntarily pursing up her lips,--which Mr. Erwyn intently\nregarded, and then wandered to the extreme end of the apartment, where he\nevinced a sudden interest in bric-\u00e0-brac.\n\n\"Is there any powder on my nose?\" said Miss Allonby.\n\n\"I fail to perceive any,\" said Mr. Erwyn.\n\n\"Come closer,\" said she.\n\n\"I dare not,\" said he.\n\nMiss Allonby wheeled about. \"Fie!\" she cried; \"one who has served against\nthe French, [Footnote: This was not absolutely so. Mr. Erwyn had, however,\nin an outburst of patriotism, embarked, as a sort of cabin passenger, with\nhis friend Sir John Morris, and possessed in consequence some claim to\nshare such honor as was won by the glorious fiasco of Dungeness.] and\nafraid of powder!\"\n\n\"It is not the powder that I fear.\"\n\n\"What, then?\" said she, in sinking to the divan beside the disordered\ntea-table.\n\n\"There are two of them,\" said Mr. Erwyn, \"and they are so red--\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" cried Miss Allonby, with heightened color.\n\n\"'Tis best to avoid temptation,\" said Mr. Erwyn, virtuously.\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" she assented, \"it is best to avoid having your ears boxed.\"\n\nMr. Erwyn sighed as if in the relinquishment of an empire. Miss Allonby\nmoved to the farther end of the divan.\n\n\"What was it,\" she demanded, \"that you had to tell me?\"\n\n\"'Tis a matter of some importance--\" said Mr. Erwyn.\n\n\"Heavens!\" said Miss Allonby, and absent-mindedly drew aside her skirts;\n\"one would think you about to make a declaration.\"\n\nMr. Erwyn sat down beside her, \"I have been known,\" said he, \"to do such\nthings.\"\n\nThe divan was strewn with cushions in the Oriental fashion. Miss Allonby,\nwith some adroitness, slipped one of them between her person and the\nlocality of her neighbor. \"Oh!\" said Miss Allonby.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, smiling over the dragon-embroidered barrier; \"I admit that\nI am even now shuddering upon the verge of matrimony.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" she marvelled, secure in her fortress. \"Have you selected an\naccomplice?\"\n\n\"Split me, yes!\" said Mr. Erwyn.\n\n\"And have I the honor of her acquaintance?\" said Miss Allonby.\n\n\"Provoking!\" said Mr. Erwyn; \"no woman knows her better.\"\n\nMiss Allonby smiled. \"Dear Mr. Erwyn,\" she stated, \"this is a disclosure I\nhave looked for these six months.\"\n\n\"Split me!\" said Mr. Erwyn.\n\n\"Heavens, yes!\" said she. \"You have been a rather dilatory lover--\"\n\n\"I am inexpressibly grieved, that I should have kept you waiting--\"\n\n\"--and in fact, I had frequently thought of reproaching you for your\ntardiness--\"\n\n\"Nay, in that case,\" said Mr. Erwyn, \"the matter could, no doubt, have been\nmore expeditiously arranged.\"\n\n\"--since your intentions have been quite apparent.\"\n\nMr. Erwyn removed the cushion. \"You do not, then, disapprove,\" said he, \"of\nmy intentions?\"\n\n\"Indeed, no,\" said Miss Allonby; \"I think you will make an excellent\nstep-father.\"\n\nThe cushion fell to the floor. Mr. Erwyn replaced it and smiled.\n\n\"And so,\" Miss Allonby continued, \"Mother, believing me in ignorance, has\ndeputed you to inform me of this most transparent secret? How strange is\nthe blindness of lovers! But I suppose,\" sighed Miss Allonby, \"we are all\nmuch alike.\"\n\n\"We?\" said Mr. Erwyn, softly.\n\n\"I meant--\" said Miss Allonby, flushing somewhat.\n\n\"Yes?\" said Mr. Erwyn. His voice sank to a pleading cadence. \"Dear child,\nam I not worthy of trust?\"\n\nThere was a microscopic pause.\n\n\"I am going to the Pantiles this afternoon,\" declared Miss Allonby, at\nlength, \"to feed the swans.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Mr. Erwyn, and with comprehension; \"surely, he, too, is rather\ntardy.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said she, \"then you know?\"\n\n\"I know,\" he announced, \"that there is a tasteful and secluded summer-house\nnear the Fountain of Neptune.\"\n\n\"I was never allowed,\" said Miss Allonby, unconvincingly, \"to go into\nsecluded summer-houses with any one; and, besides, the gardeners keep their\nbeer jugs there--under the biggest bench.\"\n\nMr. Erwyn beamed upon her paternally. \"I was not, till this, aware,\" said\nhe, \"that Captain Audaine was so much interested in ornithology. Yet what\nif, even when he is seated upon that biggest bench, your Captain does not\nutterly lose the head he is contributing to the _t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate_?\"\n\n\"Oh, but he will,\" said Miss Allonby, with confidence; then she\nreflectively added: \"I shall have again to be painfully surprised by his\ndeclaration, for, after all, it will only be his seventh.\"\n\n\"Doubtless,\" Mr. Erwyn considered, \"your astonishment will be extreme when\nyou rebuke him, there above hortensial beer jugs--\"\n\n\"And I shall be deeply grieved that he has so utterly misunderstood my\nfriendly interest in his welfare; and I shall be highly indignant after he\nhas--in effect, after he has--\"\n\n\"But not until afterward?\" said Mr. Erwyn, holding up a forefinger. \"Well,\nI have told you their redness is fatal to good resolutions.\"\n\n\"--after he has astounded me by his seventh avowal. And I shall behave\nin precisely the same manner the eighth time he recurs to the repugnant\nsubject.\"\n\n\"But the ninth time?\" said Mr. Erwyn.\n\n\"He has remarkably expressive eyes,\" Miss Allonby stated, \"and really,\nMr. Erwyn, it is the most lovable creature when it raves about my\nflint-heartedness and cutting its poor throat and murdering every man I\never nodded to!\"\n\n\"Ah, youth, youth!\" sighed Mr. Erwyn. \"Dear child, I pray you, do not\ntrifle with the happiness that is within your grasp! _Si jeunesse\nsavait_--the proverb is somewhat musty. But we who have attained the St.\nMartin's summer of our lives and have grown capable of but a calm and\ntempered affection at the utmost--we cannot but look wistfully upon the\nraptures and ignorance of youth, and we would warn you, were it possible,\nof the many dangers whereby you are encompassed. For Love is a deity that\nmust not be trifled with; his voice may chaunt the requiem of all which\nis bravest in our mingled natures, or sound a stave of such nobility as\nheartens us through life. He is kindly, but implacable; beneficent, a\nbestower of all gifts upon the faithful, a bestower of very terrible\ngifts upon those that flout him; and I who speak to you have seen my\nown contentment blighted, by just such flippant jesting with Love's\nomnipotence, before the edge of my first razor had been dulled. 'Tis true,\nI have lived since in indifferent comfort; yet it is but a dreary banquet\nwhere there is no platter laid for Love, and within the chambers of my\nheart--dust-gathering now, my dear!--he has gone unfed these fifteen years\nor more.\"\n\n\"Ah, goodness!\" sighed Miss Allonby, touched by the ardor of his speech.\n\"And so, you have loved Mother all of fifteen years?\"\n\n\"Nay, split me--!\" said Mr. Erwyn.\n\n\"Your servant, sir,\" said the voice of Lady Allonby; \"I trust you young\npeople have adjusted matters to your satisfaction?\"\n\n\nIII\n\n\"Dear madam,\" cried Miss Allonby, \"I am overjoyed!\" then kissed her\nstep-mother vigorously and left the room, casting in passage an arch glance\nat Mr. Erwyn.\n\n\"O vulgarity!\" said Lady Allonby, recovering her somewhat rumpled dignity,\n\"the sweet child is yet unpolished. But, I suppose, we may regard the\nmatter as settled?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Erwyn, \"I think, dear lady, we may with safety regard the\nmatter as settled.\"\n\n\"Dorothy is of an excitable nature,\" she observed, and seated herself upon\nthe divan; \"and you, dear Mr. Erwyn, who know women so thoroughly, will\noverlook the agitation of an artless girl placed in quite unaccustomed\ncircumstances. Nay, I myself was affected by my first declaration,\"'\n\n\"Doubtless,\" said Mr. Erwyn, and sank beside her. \"Lord Stephen was very\nmoving.\"\n\n\"I can assure you,\" said she, smiling, \"that he was not the first.\"\n\n\"I' gad,\" said he, \"I remember perfectly, in the old days, when you were\nbetrothed to that black-visaged young parson--\"\n\n\"Well, I do not remember anything of the sort,\" Lady Allonby stated; and\nshe flushed.\n\n\"You wore a blue gown,\" he said.\n\n\"Indeed?\" said she.\n\n\"And--\"\n\n\"La, if I did,\" said Lady Allonby, \"I have quite forgotten it, and it is\nnow your manifest duty to do likewise.\"\n\n\"Never in all these years,\" said Mr. Erwyn, sighing, \"have I been able to\nforget it.\"\n\n\"I was but a girl, and 'twas natural that at first I should be mistaken in\nmy fancies,\" Lady Allonby told him, precisely as she had told Simon Orts:\n\"and at all events, there is nothing less well-bred than a good memory. I\nwould decline to remain in the same room with one were it not that Dorothy\nhas deserted you in this strange fashion. Whither, pray, has she gone?\"\n\nMr. Erwyn smiled. \"Her tender heart,\" said Mr. Erwyn, \"is affected by the\npathetic and moving spectacle of the poor hungry swans, pining for their\nnative land and made a raree-show for visitors in the Pantiles; and she has\ngone to stay them with biscuits and to comfort them with cakes.\"\n\n\"Really!\" said Lady Allonby.\n\n\"And,\" Mr. Erwyn continued, \"to defend her from the possible ferocity\nof the gold-fish, Captain Audaine had obligingly afforded service as an\nescort.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Lady Allonby; then added, \"in the circumstances she might\npermissibly have broken the engagement.\"\n\n\n\"But there is no engagement,\" said Mr. Erwyn--\"as yet.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" said she.\n\n\"Harkee,\" said he; \"should he make a declaration this afternoon she will\nrefuse him.\"\n\n\"Why, but of course!\" Lady Allonby marveled.\n\n\"And the eighth time,\" said he.\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" said she; \"but at whatever are you hinting?\"\n\n\"Yet the ninth time--\"\n\n\"Well, what is it, you grinning monster?\"\n\nMr. Erwyn allowed himself a noiseless chuckle. \"After the ninth time,\" Mr.\nErwyn declared, \"there will be an engagement.\"\n\n\"Mr. Erwyn!\" cried Lady Allonby, with widened eyes, \"I had understood that\nDorothy looked favorably upon your suit.\"\n\n\"Anastasia!\" cried he; and then his finger-tips lightly caressed his brow.\n\"'Tis the first I had heard of it,\" said Mr. Erwyn.\n\n\"Surely--\" she began.\n\n\"Nay, but far more surely,\" said he, \"in consideration of the fact that,\nnot a half-hour since, you deigned to promise me your hand in marriage--\"\n\n\"O la now!\" cried Lady Allonby; and, recovering herself, smiled\ncourteously. \"'Tis the first I had heard of it,\" said she.\n\nThey stared at each other in wonderment. Then Lady Allonby burst into\nlaughter.\n\n\"D'ye mean--?\" said she.\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Mr. Erwyn, \"so unintentional was I of aspiring to Miss\nAllonby's affections that all my soul was set upon possessing the heart and\nperson of a lady, in my humble opinion, far more desirable.\"\n\n\"I had not dreamed--\" she commenced.\n\n\"Behold,\" said Mr. Erwyn, bitterly, \"how rightly is my presumption\npunished. For I, with a fop's audacity, had thought my love for you of\nsufficient moment to have been long since observed; and, strong in my\nconceit, had scorned a pleasing declaration made up of faint phrases and\nwhining ballad-endings. I spoke as my heart prompted me; but the heart has\nproven a poor counsellor, dear lady, and now am I rewarded. For you had\nnot even known of my passion, and that which my presumption had taken for\na reciprocal tenderness proves in the ultimate but a kindly aspiration to\nfurther my union with another.\"\n\n\"D'ye love me, toad?\" said Lady Allonby, and very softly.\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Mr. Erwyn, \"I have loved you all my life, first with a\nboyish inclination that I scarce knew was love, and, after your marriage\nwith an honorable man had severed us, as I thought, irrevocably, with such\nlore as an ingenuous person may bear a woman whom both circumstances and\nthe respect in which he holds her have placed beyond his reach,--a love\nthat might not be spoken, but of which I had considered you could never be\nignorant.\"\n\n\"Mr. Erwyn,\" said she, \"at least I have not been ignorant--\"\n\n\"They had each one of them some feature that reminded me of you. That was\nthe truth of it, a truth so patent that we will not discuss it. Instead,\ndear madam, do you for the moment grant a losing gamester the right to rail\nat adverse fate! for I shall trouble you no more. Since your widowhood I\nhave pursued you with attentions which, I now perceive, must at many times\nhave proven distasteful. But my adoration had blinded me; and I shall\ntrouble you no more. I have been too serious, I did not know that our\naffair was but a comedy of the eternal duel between man and woman; nor am\nI sorry, dear opponent, that you have conquered. For how valorously you\nfought! Eh, let it be! for you have triumphed in this duel, O puissant\nlady, and I yield the victor--a devoted and, it may be, a rather heavy\nheart; and I shall trouble you no more.\"\n\n\"Ah, sir,\" said Lady Allonby, \"you are aware that once--\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Mr. Erwyn, \"'twas the sand on which I builded. But I am\nwiser now, and I perceive that the feeling you entertain toward me is but\nthe pallid shadow of a youthful inclination. I shall not presume upon it.\nOh, I am somewhat proud, dear Anastasia; I have freely given you my heart,\nsuch as it is; and were you minded to accept it, even at the eleventh hour,\nthrough friendship or through pity only, I would refuse. For my love of you\nhas been the one pure and quite unselfish, emotion of my life, and I may\nnot barter it for an affection of lesser magnitude either in kind or in\ndegree. And so, farewell!\"\n\n\"Yet hold, dear sir--\" said Lady Allonby. \"Lord, but will you never let me\nhave the woman's privilege of talking!\"\n\n\"Nay, but I am, as ever, at your service,\" said Mr. Erwyn, and he paused in\ntransit for the door.\n\n\"--since, as this betokens--\"\n\n\"'Tis a tasteful handkerchief,\" said Mr. Erwyn--\"but somewhat moist!\"\n\n\"And--my eyes?\"\n\n\"Red,\" said Mr. Erwyn.\n\n\"I have been weeping, toad, with my head on the pin-cushion, and the maid\ntrying to tipsify me with brandy.\"\n\n\"Why?\" said Mr. Erwyn.\n\n\"I thought you were to marry Dorothy.\"\n\nMr. Erwyn resumed his seat. \"You objected?\" he said.\n\n\"I think, old monster,\" Lady Allonby replied, \"that I would entertain the\nsame objection to seeing any woman thus sacrificed--\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Mr. Erwyn.\n\n\"--except--\"\n\n\"Incomparable Anastasia!\" said Mr. Erwyn.\n\n\nIV\n\nAfterward these two sat long in the twilight, talking very little, and with\ntheir eyes rarely meeting, although their hands met frequently at quite\nirrelevant intervals. Just the graze of a butterfly to make it certain that\nthe other was there: but all the while they both regarded the tiny fire\nwhich had set each content of the room a-dancing in the companionable\ndarkness. For each, I take it, preferred to think of the other as being\nstill the na\u00efve young person each remembered; and the firelight made such\nthinking easier.\n\n\"D'ye remember--?\" was woven like a refrain through their placid duo....\n\nIt was, one estimates, their highest hour. Frivolous and trivial persons\nyou might have called them and have justified the accusation; but even to\nthe fop and the coquette was granted an hour wherein all human happenings\nseemed to be ordered by supernal wisdom lovingly. Very soon they would\nforget this hour; meanwhile there was a wonderful sense of dreams come\ntrue.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nTHE CASUAL HONEYMOON\n\n_As Played at Tunbridge Wells, April 1, 1750_\n\n\"_But this is the most cruel thing, to marry one does not know how, nor\nwhy, nor wherefore.--Gad, I never liked anybody less in my life.

The latter has been at pains to\nrecord the events of the afternoon and evening, so that I give you his own\naccount of them, though I abridge in consideration of his leisured style.\nPompous and verbose I grant the Captain, even in curtailment; but you are\nto remember these were the faults of his age, ingrained and defiant of\ndeletion; and should you elect to peruse his memoirs [Footnote: There\nappears to have been no American edition since that, in 1836, printed in\nPhiladelphia, \"for Thomas Wardle, No. 15 Minor Street.\" In England the\nmemoirs of Lord Garendon are to all appearance equally hard to come by,\nand seem to have been out of print since 1907.] you will find that I have\nconsiderately spared you a majority of the digressions to which the future\nEarl of Garendon was lamentably addicted.\n\nFor the purpose of my tale you are to view him as Tunbridge did at this\nparticular time: as a handsome and formal person, twenty-eight years old\nor thereabouts, of whom nobody knew anything quite definite--beyond the\ngenealogic inference to be drawn from a smatch of the brogue--save that\nafter a correspondence of gallantries, of some three weeks' duration, he\nwas the manifest slave of Miss Dorothy Allonby, and had already fought\nthree duels behind Ormerod House,--with Will Pratchet, Lord Humphrey Degge,\nand Sir Eugene Harrabie, respectively, each one of whom was a declared\nsuitor for her hand.\n\nAnd with this prelude I begin on my transcription.\n\n\nI\n\nMiss Allonby (says Captain Audaine) was that afternoon in a mighty cruel\nhumor. Though I had omitted no reasonable method to convince her of the\nimmensity of my passion, 'twas without the twitch of an eyelash she endured\nthe volley of my sighs and the fusillade of my respectful protestations;\nand candor compels me to admit that toward the end her silvery laughter\ndisrupted the periods of a most elegant and sensible peroration. And when\nthe affair was concluded, and for the seventh time I had implored her to\nmake me the happiest of men, the rogue merely observed: \"But I don't want\nto marry you. Why on earth should I?\"\n\n\"For the sake of peace,\" I replied, \"and in self-protection, since as long\nas you stay obdurate I shall continue to importune, and by and by I shall\npester you to death.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I think it more than probable,\" she returned; \"for you dog me\nlike a bailiff. I am cordially a-weary, Captain Audaine, of your incessant\npersecutions; and, after all, marrying you is perhaps the civilest way to\nbe rid of both them and you.\"\n\nBut by this I held each velvet-soft and tiny hand. \"Nay,\" I dissented; \"the\nsubject is somewhat too sacred for jest. I am no modish lover, dearest and\nbest of creatures, to regard marriage as the thrifty purchase of an estate,\nand the lady as so much bed-furniture thrown in with the mansion. I love\nyou with completeness: and give me leave to assure you, madam, with a\nfreedom which I think permissible on so serious an occasion that, even as\nbeautiful as you are, I could never be contented with your person without\nyour heart.\"\n\nShe sat with eyes downcast, all one blush. Miss Dorothy Allonby was in the\nbloom of nineteen, and shone with every charm peculiar to her sex. But I\nhave no mind to weary you with poetical rhodomontades till, as most lovers\ndo, I have proven her a paragon and myself an imbecile: it suffices to say\nthat her face, and shape, and mien, and wit, alike astounded and engaged\nall those who had the happiness to know her; and had long ago rendered her\nthe object of my entire adoration and the target of my daily rhapsodies.\nNow I viewed her with a dissension of the liveliest hopes and fears; for\nshe had hesitated, and had by this hesitation conceded my addresses to be\nnot irretrievably repugnant; and within the instant I knew that any life\nundevoted to her service and protection could be but a lingering disease.\n\nBut by and by, \"You shall have your answer this evening,\" she said, and so\nleft me.\n\nI fathomed the meaning of \"this evening\" well enough. For my adored Dorothy\nwas all romance, and by preference granted me rendezvous in the back\ngarden, where she would tantalize me nightly, from her balcony, after the\nexample of the Veronese lady in Shakespeare's spirited tragedy, which she\nprodigiously admired. As concerns myself, a reasonable liking for romance\nhad been of late somewhat tempered by the inclemency of the weather and\nthe obvious unfriendliness of the dog; but there is no resisting a lady's\ncommands; and clear or foul, you might at any twilight's death have found\nme under her window, where a host of lyric phrases asserted the devotion\nwhich a cold in the head confirmed.\n\nThis night was black as a coal-pit. Strolling beneath the casement, well\nwrapt in my cloak (for it drizzled), I meditated impartially upon the\nperfections of my dear mistress and the tyrannic despotism of love. Being\nthe source of our existence, 'tis not unreasonably, perhaps, that this\npassion assumes the proprietorship of our destinies and exacts of all\nmankind a common tribute. To-night, at least, I viewed the world as a brave\npavilion, lighted by the stars and swept by the clean winds of heaven,\nwherein we enacted varied r\u00f4les with God as audience; where, in turn, we\nstrutted or cringed about the stage, where, in turn, we were beset and\nrent by an infinity of passions; but where every man must play the part\nof lover. That passion alone, I said, is universal; it set wise Solomon\na-jigging in criminal byways, and sinewy Hercules himself was no stranger\nto its inquietudes and joys. And I cried aloud with the Roman, _Parce\nprecor!_ and afterward upon high Heaven to make me a little worthier of\nDorothy.\n\n\nII\n\nEngrossed in meditations such as these, I was fetched earthward by the\nclicking of a lock, and, turning, saw the door beneath her balcony unclose\nand afford egress to a slender and hooded figure. My amazement was\nconsiderable and my felicity beyond rhetoric.\n\n\"Dorothy--!\" I whispered.\n\n\"Come!\" was her response; and her finger-tips rested upon my arm the while\nthat she guided me toward the gateway opening into Jervis Lane. I followed\nwith a trepidation you may not easily conceive; nor was this diminished\nwhen I found awaiting us a post-chaise, into which my angel hastily\ntripped.\n\nI babbled I know not what inarticulate nonsense. But, \"Heavens!\" she\nretorted, \"d'ye mean to keep the parson waiting all night?\"\n\nThis was her answer, then. Well, 'twas more than I could have hoped for,\nthough to a man of any sensibility this summary disposal of our love-affair\ncould not but vaguely smack of the distasteful. Say what you will, every\ngentleman has about him somewhere a tincture of that venerable and artless\nage when wives were taken by capture and were retained by force; he\nprefers to have the lady hold off until the very last; and properly, her\ntongue must sound defiance long after melting eyes have signalled that the\ntraitorous heart of her, like an anatomical Tarpeia, is ready to betray the\ncitadel and yield the treasury of her charms.\n\nNevertheless, I stepped into the vehicle. The postilion was off in\na twinkling, as the saying is, over the roughest road in England.\nConversation was impossible, for Dorothy and I were jostling like two pills\nin a box; and as the first observation I attempted resulted in a badly\nbitten tongue, I prudently held my peace.\n\nThis endured for, perhaps, a quarter of an hour, at the end of which period\nthe post-chaise on a sudden stopped, and I assisted my companion to alight.\nBefore us was a villa of considerable dimension, and situate, so far as I\ncould immediately detect, in the midst of a vast and desolate moor; there\nwas no trace of human habitation within the radius of the eye; and the\nhouse itself presented not a glimpse of tenancy or illumination.\n\n\"O Lord, madam--\" I began.\n\n\"Hasten!\" spoke a voice from within the Parsonage. And Dorothy drew me\ntoward a side door, overhung with ivy, where, sure enough, a dim light\nburned, 'Twas but a solitary candle stuck upon a dresser at the remoter end\nof a large and low-ceiled apartment; and in this flickering obscurity we\nfound a tremulous parson in full canonicals, who had united our hands and\ngabbled half-way through the marriage service before I had the slightest\nnotion of what was befalling me.\n\nAnd such is the unreasonable disposition of mankind that the attainment\nof my most ardent desires aroused a feeling not altogether unakin to\nirritation. This skulking celerity, this hole-and-corner business, I\nthought, was in ill-accord with the respect due to a sacrament; and I could\nhave wished my marriage to have borne a less striking resemblance to the\nconference of three thieves in a cellar. But 'twas over in two twos. Within\nscantier time than it takes to tell of it, Francis and Dorothy were made\none, and I had turned to salute my wife.\n\nShe gave a shriek of intolerable anguish. \"Heavens!\" said she, \"I have\nmarried the wrong man!\"\n\n\nIII\n\nWithout delay I snatched up the guttering candle and held it to my wife's\ncountenance. You can conceive that 'twas with no pleasurable emotion\nI discovered I had inadvertently espoused the Dowager Marchioness of\nFalmouth, my adored Dorothy's grandmother; and in frankness I can't deny\nthat the lady seemed equally dissatisfied: words failed us; and the newly\nwedded couple stared at each other in silence.\n\n\"Captain Audaine,\" said she, at last, \"the situation is awkward.\"\n\n\"Sure, madam,\" I returned, \"and that is the precise thought which has just\noccurred to me.\"\n\n\"And I am of the opinion,\" she continued, \"that you owe me some sort of\nexplanation. For I had planned to elope with Mr. Vanringham--\"\n\n\"Do I understand your Ladyship to allude to Mr. Francis Vanringham, the\nplay-actor, at present the talk of Tunbridge?\"\n\nShe bowed a grave response.\n\n\"This is surprising news,\" said I. \"And grant me leave to tell you that a\nwoman of mature years, possessed of an abundant fortune and unassailable\ngentility, does not by ordinary sneak out of the kitchen door to meet a\nraddle-faced actor in the middle of the night. 'Tis, indeed, a circumstance\nto stagger human credulity. Oh, believe me, madam, for a virtuous woman the\nback garden is not a fitting approach to the altar, nor is a comedian an\nappropriate companion there at eleven o'clock in the evening.\"\n\n\"Hey, my fine fellow,\" says my wife, \"and what were you doing in the back\ngarden?\"\n\n\"Among all true lovers,\" I returned, \"it is an immemorial custom to prowl\nlike sentinels beneath the windows of the beauteous adored. And I,\nmadam, had the temerity to aspire toward an honorable union with your\ngranddaughter.\"\n\nShe wrung her withered hands. \"That any reputable woman should have\nnocturnal appointments with gentlemen in the back garden, and beguile her\nown grandmother into an odious marriage! I protest, Captain Audaine, the\ndegenerate world of to-day is no longer a suitable residence for a lady!\"\n\n\"Look you, sir, this is a cruel bad business,\" the Parson here put in.\nHe was pacing the apartment in an altercation of dubiety and amaze. \"Mr.\nVanringham will be vexed.\"\n\n\"You will pardon me,\" I retorted, \"if I lack pity to waste upon your Mr.\nVanringham. At present I devote all funds of compassion to my own affairs.\nAm I, indeed, to understand that this lady and I are legally married?\"\n\nHe rubbed his chin. \"By the Lord Harry,\" says he, \"'tis a case that lacks\nprecedents! But the coincidence of the Christian names is devilish awkward;\nthe service takes no cognizance of surnames; and I have merely united a\nFrancis and a Dorothy.\"\n\n\"O Lord, Mr. What-d'ye-call-um,\" said I, \"then there is but one remedy and\nthat is an immediate divorce.\"\n\nMy wife shrieked. \"Have you no sense of decency, Captain Audaine? Never has\nthere been a divorce in my family. And shall I be the first to drag that\nhonored name into a public court,--to have my reputation worried at the bar\nby a parcel of sniggering lawyers, while the town wits buzz about it like\nflies around carrion? I pray you, do not suggest any such hideous thing.\"\n\n\"Here's the other Francis,\" says the Parson, at this point. And it was,--a\nraffish, handsome, slender, red-haired fellow, somewhat suggestive of the\nroyal duke, yet rather more like a sneak-thief, and with a whiff somewhere\nof the dancing-master. At first glance you recognized in the actor a\npersonage, for he compelled the eye with a monstrous vividness of color and\ngesture. To-night he had missed his lady at their rendezvous, owing to my\npremature appearance, and had followed us post-haste.\n\n\"My Castalio!\" she screamed. \"My Beaugard!\" [Footnote: I never saw the\nrascal act, thank Heaven, since in that event, report assures me, I might\nconceivably have accredited him with the possession of some meritorious\nqualities, however trivial; but, it appears, these two above-mentioned\nr\u00f4les were the especial puppetry in which Mr. Vanringham was most\nsuccessful in wringing tears and laughter from the injudicious.--F.A.] She\nran to him, and with disjointed talk and quavering utterance disclosed the\npresent lamentable posture of affairs.\n\nAnd I found the tableau they presented singular. My wife had been a toast,\nthey tell me, in Queen Anne's time, and even now the lean and restless\ngentlewoman showed as the abandoned house of youth and wit and beauty, with\nhere and there a trace of the old occupancy; always her furtive eyes shone\nwith a cold and shifting glitter, as though a frightened imp peeped through\na mask of Hecuba; and in every movement there was an ineffable touch of\nsomething loosely hinged and fantastic. In a word, the Marchioness was\nnot unconscionably sane, and was known far and wide as a gallant woman\nresolutely oblivious to the batterings of time, and so avid of flattery\nthat she was ready to smile on any man who durst give the lie to her\nlooking-glass. Demented landlady of her heart, she would sublet that\nantiquated chamber to the first adventurer who came prepared to pay his\nscot in the false coin of compliment; and 'twas not difficult to comprehend\nhow this young Thespian had acquired its tenancy.\n\nBut now the face of Mr. Vanringham was attenuated by her revelations, and\nthe wried mouth of Mr. Vanringham suggested that the party be seated, in\norder to consider more at ease the unfortunate _contretemps_. Fresh lights\nwere kindled, as one and all were past fear of discovery by this; and we\nfour assembled about a table which occupied the centre of the apartment.\n\n\nIV\n\n\"The situation,\" Mr. Vanringham, began, \"may reasonably be described as\ndesperate. Here we sit, four ruined beings. For Dr. Quarmby has betrayed\nan unoffending couple into involuntary matrimony, an act of which his\nBishop can scarcely fail to take official notice; Captain Audaine and\nthe Marchioness are entrapped into a loveless marriage, than which there\nmayn't be a greater misery in life; and my own future, I needn't add, is\nirrevocably blighted by the loss of my respected Dorothy, without whom\ncontinued animation must necessarily be a hideous and hollow mockery. Yet\nthere occurs to me a panacea for these disasters.\"\n\n\"Then, indeed, Mr. Vanringham,\" said I, \"there is one of us who will be\nuncommonly glad to know the name of it.\"\n\nHe faced me with a kind of compassion in his wide-set brown eyes, \"You,\nsir, have caused a sweet and innocent lady to marry you against her\nwill--Oho, beyond doubt, your intentions were immaculate; but the outcome\nremains in its stark enormity, and the hand of an inquisitive child is not\nordinarily salved by its previous ignorance as to the corrosive properties\nof fire. You have betrayed confiding womanhood, an act abhorrent to\nall notions of gentility. There is but one conclusive proof of your\nrepentance.--Need I mention that I allude to self-destruction?\"\n\n\"O Lord, sir,\" I observed, \"suicide is a deadly sin, and I would not\nwillingly insult any gentlewoman by evincing so marked a desire for the\ndevil's company in preference to hers.\"\n\n\"Your argument is sophistry,\" he returned, \"since 'tis your death alone\nthat can endear you to your bride. Death is the ultimate and skilled\nassayer of alloyed humanity: and by his art our gross constituents--our\nfoibles, our pettinesses, nay, our very crimes--are precipitated into the\ncoffin, the while that his crucible sets free the volatile pure essence,\nand shows as undefiled by all life's accidents that part of divinity which\nharbors in the vilest bosom. This only is remembered: this only mounts,\nlike an ethereal spirit, to hallow the finished-with blunderer's renown,\nand reverently to enshrine his body's resting-place. Ah, no, Captain\nAudaine! death alone may canonize the husband. Once you're dead, your wife\nwill adore you; once you're dead, your wife and I have before us an open\nroad to connubial felicity, a road which, living, you sadly encumber; and\nonly when he has delivered your funeral oration may Dr. Quarmby be exempt\nfrom apprehension lest his part in your marriage ceremony bring about his\ndefrockment. I urge the greatest good for the greatest number, Captain;\nliving, you plunge all four of us into suffering; whereas the nobility of\nan immediate _felo-de-se_ will in common decency exalt your soul to Heaven\naccompanied and endorsed by the fervent prayers of three grateful hearts.\"\n\n\"And by the Lord Harry,\" says the Parson, \"while no clergyman extant has\na more cordial aversion to suicide, I cannot understand why a prolonged\nexistence should tempt you. You love Miss Dorothy Allonby, as all Tunbridge\nknows; and to a person of sensibility, what can be more awkward than\nto have thrust upon him grandfathership of the adored one? You must in\nthis position necessarily be exposed to the committal of a thousand\n_gaucheries_; and if you insist upon your irreligious project of procuring\na divorce, what, I ask, can be your standing with the lady? Can she smile\nupon the suit of an individual who has publicly cast aside the sworn love\nand obedience of the being to whom she owes her very existence? or will\nany clergyman in England participate in the union of a woman to her\nex-grandfather? Nay, believe me, sir, 'tis less the selfishness than the\nfolly of your clinging to this vale of tears which I deplore. And I protest\nthat this rope\"--he fished up a coil from the corner--\"appears to have\nbeen deposited here by a benign and all-seeing Providence to Suggest\nthe manifold advantages of hanging yourself as compared with the untidy\noperation of cutting one's throat.\"\n\n\"And conceive, sir,\" says my wife, \"what must be the universal grief\nfor the bridegroom so untimelily taken off in the primal crescence of\nhis honeymoon! Your funeral will be unparalleled both for sympathy and\nsplendor; all Tunbridge will attend in tears; and 'twill afford me a\nmelancholy but sincere pleasure to extend to you the hospitality of the\nAllonby mausoleum, which many connoisseurs have accounted the finest in the\nthree kingdoms.\"\n\n\"I must venture,\" said I, \"to terminate this very singular conversation.\nYou have, one and all, set forth the advantages of my immediate demise;\nyour logic is unassailable and has proven suicide my plain duty; and my\nrebuttal is confined to the statement that I will see every one of you\ndamned before I'll do it.\"\n\nMr. Francis Vanringham rose with a little bow. \"You have insulted both\nwomanhood and the Established Church by the spitting out of that ribald\noath; and me you have with equal levity wronged by the theft of my\naffianced bride. I am only a play-actor, but in inflicting an insult a\ngentleman must either lift his inferior to his own station or else forfeit\nhis gentility. I wear a sword, Captain Audaine. Heyho, will you grant me\nthe usual satisfaction?\"\n\n\"My fascinating comedian,\" said I, \"if 'tis a fight you are desirous of,\nI can assure you that in my present state I would cross swords with a\ncostermonger, or the devil, or the Archbishop of Canterbury, with equal\nimpartiality. But scarcely in the view of a lady, and, therefore, as you\nboast the greater influence in that quarter, will you kindly advise the\nwithdrawal of yonder unexpected addition to my family?\"\n\n\"There's an inner room,\" says he, pointing to the door behind me; and I\nheld it open as my wife swept through.\n\n\"You are the epitome of selfishness,\" she flung out, in passing; \"for had\nyou possessed an ounce of gallantry, you would long ago have freed me from\nthis odious marriage.\"\n\n\"Sure, madam,\" I returned, with a _cong\u00e9e_; \"and is it not rather a\ncompliment that I so willingly forfeit a superlunar bliss in order to\nretain the pleasure of your society?\"\n\nShe sniffed, and I closed the door; and within the moment the two men fell\nupon me, from the rear, and presently had me trussed like a fowl and bound\nwith that abominable Parson's coil of rope.\n\n\nV\n\n\"Believe me,\" says Mr. Vanringham, now seated upon the table and indolently\ndangling his heels,--the ecclesiastical monstrosity, having locked the\ndoor upon Mrs. Audaine, had occupied a chair and was composedly smoking\na churchwarden,--\"believe me, I lament the necessity of this uncouth\nproceeding. But heyho! man is a selfish animal. You take me, sir, my\naffection for yonder venerable lady does not keep me awake o' nights; yet\nis a rich marriage the only method to amend my threadbare fortunes, so that\nI cheerfully avail myself of her credulity. By God!\" cried he, with a quick\nraising of the voice, \"to-morrow I had been a landed gentleman but for you,\nyou blundering omadhaun! And is a shabby merry-andrew from the devil knows\nwhere to pop in and spoil the prettiest plot was ever hatched?\"\n\n'Twas like a flare of lightning, this sudden outburst of malignity; for\nyou saw in it, quintessentialized, the man's stark and venomous hatred of\na world which had ill-used him; and 'twas over with too as quickly as the\nlightning, yielding to the pleasantest smile imaginable. Meanwhile you are\nto picture me, and my emotions, as I lay beneath his oscillating toes,\nentirely helpless. \"'Twas not that I lacked the courage to fight you,\" he\ncontinues, \"nor the skill, either. But there is always the possibility\nthat by some awkward thrust or other you might deprive the stage of a\ndistinguished ornament; and as a sincere admirer of my genius, I must,\nin decency, avoid such risks. 'Twas necessary to me, of course, that you\nbe got out of this world speedily, since a further continuance of your\nblunderings would interfere with my plans for the future; having gone thus\nfar, I cannot reasonably be expected to cede my interest in the Marchioness\nand her estate. Accordingly I decide upon the handiest method and tip the\nwink to Quarmby here; the lady quits the apartment in order to afford us\nopportunity to settle our pretensions, with cutlery as arbiter; and she\nwill return to find your perforated carcass artistically displayed in\nyonder extremity of the room. Slain in an affair of honor, my dear Captain!\nThe disputed damsel will think none the worse of me, a man of demonstrated\nvalor and affection; Quarmby and I'll bury you in the cellar; and being\nfreed from her recent and unfortunate alliance, my esteemed Dorothy will\nseek consolation in the embraces of a more acceptable spouse. Confess, sir,\nis it not a scheme of Arcadian simplicity?\"\n\n'Twas the most extraordinary sensation to note the utterly urbane and\ncheerful countenance with which Mr. Vanringham disclosed the meditated\natrocity. This unprincipled young man was about to run me through with no\nmore compunction than a naturalist in the act of pinning a new beetle among\nhis collection may momentarily be aware of.\n\nThen my quickened faculties were stirred on a sudden, and for the first\ntime I opened my mouth. Whatever claim I had upon Vanringham, there was no\nneed to advance it now.\n\n\"You were about to say--?\" he queried.\n\n\"I was about to relieve a certain surplusage of emotion,\" I retorted, \"by\nobserving that I regret to find you, sir, a chattering, lean-witted fool--a\nvain and improvident fool!\"\n\n\"Harsh words, my Captain,\" says he, with lifted eyebrows.\n\n\"O Lord, sir, but not of an undeserved asperity!\" I returned, \"D'ye think\nthe Marchioness, her flighty head crammed with scraps of idiotic romance,\nwould elope without regard for the canons of romance? Not so; depend upon\nit, a letter was left upon her pin-cushion announcing her removal with\nyou, and in the most approved heroic style arraigning the obduracy of her\nunsympathetic grandchildren. D'ye think Gerald Allonby will not follow\nher? Sure, and he will; and the proof is,\" I added, \"that you may hear his\nhorses yonder on the heath, as I heard them some moments ago.\"\n\nVanringham leaped to the floor and stood thus, all tension. He raised\nclenched, quivering hands toward the ceiling. \"O King of Jesters!\" he\ncried, in horrid blasphemy; and then again, \"O King of Jesters!\"\n\nAnd by this time men were shouting without, and at the door there was a\nprodigious and augmenting hammering. And the Parson wrung his hands and\nbegan to shake like a dish of jelly in a thunder-storm.\n\n\"Captain Audaine,\" Mr. Vanringham resumed, with more tranquillity, \"you are\ncorrect. Clidamira and Parthenissa would never have fled into the night\nwithout leaving a note upon the pin-cushion. The folly I kindled in your\nwife's addled pate has proven my ruin. Remains to make the best of Hobson's\nchoice.\" He unlocked the door. \"Gentlemen, gentlemen!\" says he, with\ndeprecating hand, \"surely this disturbance is somewhat _outr\u00e9_, a trifle\nmisplaced, upon the threshold of a bridal-chamber?\"\n\nThen Gerald Allonby thrust into the room, followed by Lord Humphrey Degge,\n[Footnote: I must in this place entreat my reader's profound discredit of\nany aspersions I may rashly seem to cast upon this honest gentleman, whose\nfriendship I to-day esteem as invaluable; but I wrote, as always, _currente\ncalamo_, and the above was penned in an amorous misery, _sub Venire_, be\nit remembered; and in such cases a wrong bias is easily hung upon the\nmind.--F.A.] my abhorred rival for Dorothy's affection, and two attendants.\n\n\"My grandmother!\" shrieks Gerald. \"Villain, what have you done with my\ngrandmother?\"\n\n\"The query were more fitly put,\" Vanringham retorts, \"to the lady's\nhusband.\" And he waves his hand toward me.\n\nThereupon the new-comers unbound me with various exclamations of wonder.\n\"And now,\" I observed, \"I would suggest that you bestow upon Mr. Vanringham\nand yonder blot upon the Church of England the bonds from which I have been\nrecently manumitted, or, at the very least, keep a vigilant watch upon\nthose more than suspicious characters, the while that I narrate the\nsurprising events of this evening.\"\n\n\nVI\n\nSubsequently I made a clean breast of affairs to Gerald and Lord Humphrey\nDegge. They heard me with attentive, even sympathetic, countenances; but by\nand by the face of Lord Humphrey brightened as he saw a not unformidable\nrival thus jockeyed from the field; and when I had ended, Gerald rose and\nwith an oath struck his open palm upon the table.\n\n\"This is the most fortunate coincidence,\" he swears, \"that I have ever\nknown of. I come prepared to find my grandmother the wife of a beggarly\nplay-actor, and I discover that, to the contrary, she has contracted an\nalliance with a gentleman for whom I entertain sincere affection.\"\n\n\"Surely,\" I cried, aghast, \"you cannot deliberate acceptance of this\niniquitous and inadvertent match!\"\n\n\"What is your meaning, Captain Audaine?\" says the boy, sharply. \"What other\ncourse is possible?\"'\n\n\"O Lord!\" said I, \"after to-night's imbroglio I have nothing to observe\nconcerning the possibility of anything; but if this marriage prove a legal\none, I am most indissuadably resolved to rectify matters without delay in\nthe divorce court.\"\n\nNow Gerald's brows were uglily compressed. \"A divorce,\" said he, with an\nextreme of deliberation, \"means the airing of to-night's doings in the\nopen. I take it, 'tis the duty of a man of honor to preserve the reputation\nof his grandmother stainless; whether she be a housemaid or the Queen\nof Portugal, her frailties are equally entitled to endurance, her\neccentricities to toleration: can a gentleman, then, sanction any\nproceeding of a nature calculated to make his grandmother the\nlaughing-stock of England? The point is a nice one.\"\n\n\"For, conceive,\" said Lord Humphrey, with the most knavish grin I ever knew\na human countenance to pollute itself with, \"that the entire matter will be\nconvoyed by the short-hand writers to the public press, and after this will\nbe hawked about the streets; and that the venders will yell particulars of\nyour grandmother's folly under your very windows; and that you must hear\nthem in impotence, and that for some months the three kingdoms will hear of\nnothing else. Gad, I quite feel for you, my dear.\"\n\n\"I have fallen into a nest of madmen,\" I cried. \"You know, both of you, how\nprofoundly I adore Mr. Gerald's sister, the accomplished and bewitching\nMiss Allonby; and in any event, I demand of you, as rational beings, is\nit equitable that I be fettered for life to an old woman's apron-strings\nbecause a doctor of divinity is parsimonious of his candles?\"\n\nBut Gerald had drawn with a flourish. \"You have repudiated my kinswoman,\"\nsays he, \"and you cannot deny me the customary satisfaction. Harkee, my\nfine fellow, Dorothy will marry my friend Lord Humphrey if she will be\nadvised by me; or if she prefer it, she may marry the Man in the Iron Mask\nor the piper that played before Moses, so far as I am concerned: but as for\nyou, I hereby offer you your choice between quitting this apartment as my\ngrandfather or as a corpse.\"\n\n\"I won't fight you!\" I shouted. \"Keep the boy off, Degge!\" But when the\ninfuriate lad rushed upon me, I was forced, in self-protection, to draw,\nand after a brief engagement to knock his sword across the room.\n\n\"Gerald,\" I pleaded, \"for the love of reason, consider! I cannot fight you.\nHeaven knows this tragic farce hath robbed me of all pretension toward your\nsister, and that I am just now but little better than a madman; yet 'tis\nher blood which exhilarates your veins, and with such dear and precious\nfluid I cannot willingly imbrue my hands. Nay, you are no swordsman,\nlad,--keep off!\"\n\nAnd there I had blundered irretrievably.\n\n\"No swordsman! By God, I fling the words in your face, Frank Audaine! must\nI send the candlestick after them?\" And within the instant he had caught\nup his weapon and had hurled himself upon me, in an abandoned fury. I had\nnot moved. The boy spitted himself upon my sword and fell with a horrid\ngasping.\n\n\"You will bear me witness, Lord Humphrey,\" said I, \"that the quarrel was\nnot of my provokement.\"\n\nBut at this juncture the outer door reopened and Dorothy tripped into the\nroom, preceding Lady Allonby and Mr. George Erwyn. They had followed in the\nfamily coach to dissuade the Marchioness from her contemplated match by\nforce or by argument, as the cat might jump; and so it came about that my\ndear mistress and I stared at each other across her brother's lifeless\nbody.\n\nAnd 'twas in this poignant moment I first saw her truly. In a storm you\nhave doubtless had some utterly familiar scene leap from the darkness,\nunder the lash of lightning, and be for the instant made visible and\nstrange; and I beheld her with much that awful clarity. Formerly 'twas her\nbeauty had ensnared me, and this I now perceived to be a fortuitous and\nhappy medley of color and glow and curve, indeed, yet nothing more. 'Twas\nthe woman I loved, not her trappings; and her eyes were no more part of her\nthan were the jewels in her ears. But the sweet mirth of her, the brave\nheart, the clean soul, the girl herself, how good and generous and kind\nand tender,--'twas this that I now beheld, and knew that this, too, was\nlost;--and, in beholding, the little love of yesterday fled whimpering\nbefore the sacred passion which had possessed my being. And I began to\nlaugh.\n\n\"My dear,\" said I, \"'twas to-night that you promised me your answer, and\nto-night you observe in me alike your grandfather and your brother's\nmurderer.\"\n\n\nVII\n\nLady Allonby fell to wringing her hands, but Dorothy had knelt beside the\nprostrate form and was inspecting the ravages of my fratricidal sword. \"Oh,\nfy! fy!\" says she immediately, and wrinkles her saucy nose; \"had none of\nyou the sense to perceive that Gerald was tipsy? And as for the wound, 'tis\nonly a scratch here on the left shoulder. Get water, somebody.\" And her\ncommand being obeyed, she cleansed the hurt composedly and bandaged it with\nthe ruffle of her petticoat.\n\nMeanwhile we hulking men stood thick about her, fidgeting and foolishly\ngaping like a basket of fish; and presently a sibilance of relief went\nabout our circle as Gerald opened his eyes. \"Sister,\" says he, with a\nprofoundly tragic face, \"remember--remember that I perished to preserve the\nhonor of our family.\"\n\n\"To preserve a fiddlestick!\" said my adored Dorothy. And, rising, she\nconfronted me, a tinted statuette of decision. \"Now, Frank,\" says she, \"I\nwould like to know the meaning of this nonsense.\"\n\nAnd thereupon, for the second time, I recounted the dreadful and huddled\naction of the night.\n\nWhen I had ended, \"The first thing,\" says she, \"is to let Grandmother out\nof that room. And the second is to show me the Parson.\" This was done; the\nDowager entered in an extremity of sulkiness, and the Parson, on being\npointed out, lowered his eyes and intensified his complexion.\n\n\"As I anticipated,\" says my charmer, \"you are, one and all, a parcel of\ncredulous infants. 'Tis a parson, indeed, but merely the parson out of\nVanbrugh's _Relapse_; only last Friday, sir, we heartily commended your\nfine performance. Why, Frank, the man is one of the play-actors.\"\n\n\"I fancy,\" Mr. Vanringham here interpolates, \"that I owe the assembled\ncompany some modicum of explanation. 'Tis true that at the beginning of\nour friendship I had contemplated matrimony with our amiable Marchioness,\nbut, I confess, 'twas the lady's property rather than her person which was\nthe allure. And reflection dissuaded me; a legal union left me, a young\nand not unhandsome man, irrevocably fettered to an old woman; whereas a\nmock-marriage afforded an eternal option to compound the match--for a\nconsideration--with the lady's relatives, to whom, I had instinctively\ndivined, her alliance with me would prove distasteful. Accordingly I\nhad availed myself of my colleague's skill [Footnote: I witnessed this\nsame Quarmby's hanging in 1754, and for a burglary, I think, with an\nextraordinary relish.--F.A.] in the portrayal of clerical parts rather than\nresort to any parson whose authority was unrestricted by the footlights.\nAnd accordingly--\"\n\n\"And accordingly my marriage,\" I interrupted, \"is not binding?\"\n\n\"I can assure you,\" he replied, \"that you might trade your lawful right in\nthe lady for a twopenny whistle and not lose by the bargain.\"\n\n\"And what about my marriage?\" says the Marchioness--\"the marriage which was\nnever to be legalized?--'twas merely that you might sell me afterward, like\nso much mutton, was it, you jumping-jack--!\"\n\nBut I spare you her ensuing gloss upon this text.\n\nThe man heard her through, without a muscle twitching. \"It is more than\nprobable,\" he conceded, \"that I have merited each and every fate your\nLadyship is pleased to invoke. Indeed, I consider the extent of your\ndistresses to be equaled only by that of your vocabulary. Yet by ordinary\nthe heart of woman is not obdurate, and upon one lady here I have some\nclaim--\"\n\nDorothy had drawn away from him, with an odd and frightened cry. \"Not upon\nme, sir! I never saw you except across the footlights. You know I never saw\nyou except across the footlights, Mr. Vanringham!\"\n\nFixedly he regarded her, with a curious yet not unpleasing smile. \"I am\nthe more unfortunate,\" he said, at last. \"Nay, 'twas to Lady Allonby I\naddressed my appeal.\"\n\nThe person he named had been whispering with George Erwyn, but now she\nturned toward the actor. \"Heavens!\" said Lady Allonby, \"to think I should\nbe able to repay you this soon! La, of course, you are at liberty, Mr.\nVanringham, and we may treat the whole series of events as a frolic\nsuited to the day. For I am under obligations to you, and, besides, your\npunishment would breed a scandal, and, above all, anything is preferable to\nbeing talked about in the wrong way.\"\n\nHaving reasons of my own, I was elated by the upshot of this rather\nremarkable affair. Yet in justice to my own perspicacity, I must declare\nthat it occurred to me, at this very time, that Mr. Vanringham had proven\nhimself not entirely worthy of unlimited confidence, I reflected, however,\nthat I had my instructions, and that, if a bad king may prove a good\nhusband, a knave may surely carry a letter with fidelity, the more so if it\nbe to his interest to do it.\n\n\nVIII\n\nI rode back to Tunbridge in the coach, with Dorothy at my side and with\nGerald recumbent upon the front seat,--where, after ten minutes' driving\nthe boy very philanthropically fell asleep.\n\n\"And you have not,\" I immediately asserted--\"after all, you have not given\nme the answer which was to-night to decide whether I be of all mankind the\nmost fortunate or the most miserable. And 'tis nearing twelve.\"\n\n\"What choice have I?\" she murmured; \"after to-night is it not doubly\napparent that you need some one to take care of you? And, besides, this is\nyour eighth proposal, and the ninth I had always rather meant to accept,\nbecause I have been in love with you for two whole weeks.\"\n\nMy heart stood still. And shall I confess that for an instant my wits,\ntoo, paused to play the gourmet with my emotions? She sat beside me in the\ndarkness, you understand, waiting, mine to touch. And everywhere the world\nwas filled with beautiful, kind people, and overhead God smiled down upon\nHis world, and a careless seraph had left open the door of Heaven, so that\nquite a deal of its splendor flooded the world about us. And the snoring\nof Gerald was now inaudible because of a stately music which was playing\nsomewhere.\n\n\"Frank--!\" she breathed. And I noted that her voice was no less tender than\nher lips.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nTHE RHYME TO PORRINGER\n\n\n_As Played at Tunbridge Wells, April 2, 1750_\n\n    \"_Ye gods, why are not hearts first paired above,\n  But still some interfere in others' love,\n  Ere each for each by certain marks are known?\n  You mould them up in haste, and drop them down,\n  And while we seek what carelessly you sort,\n  You sit in state, and make our pains your sport._\"\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6\n\nCAPTAIN AUDAINE, an ingenious, well-accomplished gentleman.\nLORD HUMPHREY DEGGE, an airy young gentleman, loves Miss Allonby for her\nmoney.\nVANRINGHAM, emissary and confederate of Audaine.\nMISS ALLONBY, a young lady of wit and fortune.\n\nATTENDANTS to Lord Humphrey, Etc.\n\n\nSCENE\n\nTunbridge Wells, first in and about Lord Humphrey's lodgings, then shifting\nto a drawing-room in Lady Allonby's villa.\n\n\nTHE RHYME TO PORRINGER\n\n\nPROEM:--_Merely to Serve as Intermezzo_\n\nNext morning Captain Audaine was closeted with Mr. Vanringham in the\nlatter's apartments at the _Three Gudgeons_. I abridge the Captain's\nrelation of their interview, and merely tell you that it ended in the\nactor's looking up, with a puzzled face, from a certain document.\n\n\"You might have let me have a whiff of this,\" Mr. Vanringham began. \"You\nmight have breathed, say, a syllable or two last night--\"\n\n\"I had my instructions, sir, but yesterday,\" replied the Captain; \"and\nsurely, Mr. Vanringham, to have presumed last night upon my possession of\nthis paper, so far as to have demanded any favor of you, were unreasonable,\neven had it not savored of cowardice. For, as it has been very finely\nobserved, it is the nicest part of commerce in the world, that of doing and\nreceiving benefits. O Lord, sir! there are so many thousand circumstances,\nwith respect to time, person, and place, which either heighten or allay the\nvalue of the obligation--\"\n\n\"I take your point,\" said the other, with some haste, \"and concede that you\nare, beyond any reasonable doubt, in the right. Within the hour I am off.\"\n\n\"Then all is well,\" said Captain Audaine.\n\nBut he was wrong in this opinion, so wrong that I confute him by subjoining\nhis own account of what befell, somewhat later in the day.\n\n\nI\n\n'Twas hard upon ten in the evening (the Captain estimates) when I left\nLady Culcheth's, [Footnote: Sir Henry Muskerry's daughter, of whom I have\nalready spoken, and by common consent an estimable lady and a person of\nfine wit; but my infatuation for Lady Betty had by this time, after three\nnights with her, been puffed out; and this fortunate extinction, through\nthe affair of the broken snuffbox, had left me now entirely indifferent to\nall her raptures, panegyrics, and premeditated artlessnesses.--F. A.] and I\nprotest that at the time there was not a happier man in all Tunbridge than\nFrancis Audaine.\n\n\"You haven't the king?\" Miss Allonby was saying, as I made my adieus to the\ncompany. \"Then I play queen, knave, and ace, which gives me the game, Lord\nHumphrey.\"\n\nAnd afterward she shuffled the cards and flashed across the room a glance\nwhose brilliance shamed the tawdry candles about her, and, as you can\nreadily conceive, roused a prodigious trepidation in my adoring breast.\n\n\"Dorothy!--O Dorothy!\" I said over and over again when I had reached the\nstreet; and so went homeward with constant repetitions of her dear name.\n\nI suppose it was an idiotic piece of business; but you are to remember\nthat I loved her with an entire heart, and that, as yet, I could scarcely\nbelieve the confession of a reciprocal attachment, which I had wrung from\nher overnight, to the accompaniment of Gerald's snoring, had been other\nthan an unusually delectable and audacious dream upon the part of Frank\nAudaine.\n\nI found it, then, as I went homeward, a heady joy to ponder on her\nloveliness. Oh, the wonder of her voice, that is a love-song! cried my\nheart. Oh, the candid eyes of her, more beautiful than the June heavens,\nmore blue than the very bluest speedwell-flower! Oh, the tilt of her tiny\nchin, and the incredible gold of her hair, and the quite unbelievable\npink-and-white of her little flower-soft face! And, oh, the scrap of\ncrimson that is her mouth.\n\nIn a word, my pulses throbbed with a sort of divine insanity, and Frank\nAudaine was as much out of his senses as any madman now in Bedlam, and as\ndeliriously perturbed as any lover is by ordinary when he meditates upon\nthe object of his affections.\n\nBut there was other work than sonneting afoot that night, and shortly I\nset about it. Yet such was my felicity that I went to my nocturnal labors\nsinging. Yes, it rang in my ears, somehow, that silly old Scotch song, and\nunder my breath I hummed odd snatches of it as I went about the night's\nbusiness.\n\nSang I:\n\n    \"Ken ye the rhyme to porringer?\n  Ken ye the rhyme to porringer?\n  King James the Seventh had ae daughter,\n  And he gave her to an Oranger.\n\n    \"Ken ye how he requited him?\n  Ken ye how he requited him?\n  The dog has into England come,\n  And ta'en the crown in spite of him!\n\n    \"The rogue he salna keep it lang,\n  To budge we'll make him fain again;\n  We'll hang him high upon a tree,\n  And King James shall hae his ain again!\"\n\n\nII\n\nWell! matters went smoothly enough at the start. With a diamond Vanringham\ndexterously cut out a pane of glass, so that we had little difficulty in\nopening the window; and I climbed into a room black as a pocket, leaving\nhim without to act as a sentinel, since, so far as I could detect, the\nhouse was now untenanted.\n\nBut some twenty minutes later, when I had finally succeeded in forcing the\nescritoire I found in the back room upon the second story, I heard the\nstreet door unclose. And I had my candle extinguished in that self same\ninstant. You can conceive that 'twas with no pleasurable anticipation I\npeered into the hall, for I was fairly trapped. I saw some five or six men\nof an ugly aspect, who carried among them a burden, the nature of which I\ncould not determine in the uncertain light. But I heaved a sigh of relief\nas they bore their cargo past me, to the front room, (which opened on the\none I occupied), without apparent recognition of my presence.\n\n\"Now,\" thinks I, \"is the time for my departure.\" And having already\nselected the papers I had need of from the rifled desk, I was about to run\nfor it, when I heard a well-known voice.\n\n\"Rat the parson!\" it cried; \"he should have been here an hour ago. Here's\nthe door left open for him, endangering the whole venture, and whey-face\nhan't plucked up heart to come! Do some of you rogues fetch him without\ndelay; and do all of you meet me to-morrow at the _Mitre_, to be paid in\nfull for this business, before reporting to his Grace.\"\n\n\"Here,\" thinks I, \"is beyond doubt a romance.\" And as the men tumbled\ndown-stairs and into the street, I resolved to see the adventure through,\nby the light of those candles which were now burning in the next room.\n\nI waited for perhaps ten minutes, during which period I was aware of divers\nmovements near at hand; and, judging that in any case there was but one\nman's anger to be apprehended, I crept toward the intervening door and\nfound it luckily ajar.\n\nSo I peered through the crack into the adjoining room, and there, as I had\nanticipated, discovered Lord Humphrey Degge, whom I had last seen at Lady\nCulcheth's wrangling over a game of _\u00e9cart\u00e9_ with the fairest antagonist\nthe universe could afford.\n\nJust now my Lord was in a state of high emotion, and the cause of it was\nevident when I perceived his ruffians had borne into the house a swooning\nlady, whom merciful unconsciousness had rendered oblivious to her present\nsurroundings, and whose wrists his Lordship was vigorously slapping in the\nintervals between his frequent applications to her nostrils of a flask,\nwhich, as I more lately learned, contained sal volatile.\n\nHere was an unlucky turn, since I had no desire to announce my whereabouts,\nmy business in the house being of a sort that necessitated secrecy;\nwhereas, upon the other hand, I could not but misdoubt my Lord's intention\ntoward the unknown fair was of discreditable kinship, and such as a\ngentleman might not countenance with self-esteem.\n\nAccordingly I devoted the moments during which the lady was recovering\nfrom her swoon, to serious reflection concerning the course that I should\npreferably adopt. But now, Miss came to, and, as is the custom of all\nfemales similarly situated, rubbed her eyes and said, \"Where am I?\"\n\nAnd when she rose from the divan I saw that 'twas my adored Dorothy.\n\n\"In the presence of your infatuated slave,\" says my Lord. \"Ah, divine Miss\nAllonby--!\"\n\nBut being now aware of her deplorable circumstances, she began to weep,\nand, in spite of the amorous rhetoric with which his Lordship was prompt to\ncomfort her, rebuked him for unmanly conduct, with sublimity and fire, and\ndepicted the horrors of her present predicament in terms that were both\njust and elegant.\n\nFrom their disjointed talk I soon determined that, Lord Humphrey's suit\nbeing rejected by my angel, he had laid a trap for her (by bribing her\ncoachman, as I subsequently learned), and had so far succeeded in his\nnefarious scheme that she, on leaving Lady Culcheth's, had been driven\nto this house, in the conviction she rode homeward; and this course my\nLord endeavored to justify, with a certain eloquence, and attributed the\nirregularity of his behavior solely to the colossal vehemence of his\naffection.\n\nHis oratory, however, was of little avail, for Dorothy told him plainly\nthat she had rather hear the protestations of a toad than listen to his far\nmore nauseous flattery; and bade him at once restore her to her natural\nguardians.\n\n\"_Ma charmante_,\" said he, \"to-morrow your good step-mother may, if you\nwill, share with your husband the privilege of saluting Lady Humphrey\nDegge; but as for Miss Allonby, I question if in the future her dearest\nfriends are likely to see much of her.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" cries she.\n\n\"That the parson will be here directly,\" said he.\n\n\"Infamous!\" she observes; \"and is the world run mad, that these extempore\nweddings should be foisted upon every woman in the Allonby connection!\"\n\n\"Ah, but, my dear,\" he answered airily, \"'twas those two fiascos which\nbegot my notion, and yet hearten me. For in every approved romance the\nthird adventurer gets the victory; so that I am, I take it, predestinate to\nwin where Vanringham and Rokesle failed.\"\n\nShe did not chop logic with him, but instead retorted in a more primitive\nfashion by beginning to scream at the top of her voice.\n\nI doubt if any man of honor was ever placed under a more great embarrass.\nYonder was the object of my devotion, exposed to all the diabolical\nmachinations of a heartless villain; and here was I concealed in my Lord's\nbedroom, his desk broken open, and his papers in my pocket. To remain quiet\nwas impossible, since 'twas to expose her to a fate worse than death; yet\nto reveal myself was to confess Frank Audaine a thief, and to lose her\nperhaps beyond redemption.\n\nThen I thought of the mask which I had brought in case of emergency; and,\nclapping it on, resolved to brazen out the affair. Meanwhile I saw all\nnotions of gallantry turned topsy-turvy, for my Lord was laughing quietly,\nwhile my adored Dorothy called aloud upon the name of her Maker.\n\n\"The neighborhood is not unaccustomed to such sounds,\" said he, \"and I\nhardly think we need fear any interruption. I must tell you, my dear\ncreature, you have, by an evil chance, arrived in a most evil locality, for\nthis quarter of the town is the devil's own country, and he is scarcely\nlike to make you free of it.\"\n\n\"O Lord, sir!\" said I, and pushed the door wide open, \"surely you forget\nthat the devil is a gentleman?\"\n\n\nIII\n\nHad I dropped a hand-grenade into the apartment the astonishment of its\noccupants would not have been excessive. My Lord's face, as he clapped\nhis hand to his sword, was neither tranquil nor altogether agreeable to\ncontemplate; but as for Dorothy, she gave a frightened little cry, and ran\ntoward the masked intruder with a piteous confidence which wrung my heart.\n\n\"The devil!\" says my Lord.\n\n\"Not precisely,\" I amended, and bowed in my best manner, \"though 'tis\nundeniable I come to act as his representative.\"\n\n\"Oh, joy to your success!\" his Lordship sneered.\n\n\"Harkee, sir,\" said I, \"as you, with perfect justice, have stated, this is\nthe devil's stronghold, and hereabouts his will is paramount; and, as I\nhave had the honor to add, the devil is a gentleman. Sure, and as such, he\ncannot be expected to countenance your present behavior? Nay, never fear!\nLucifer, already up to the ears in the affairs of this mundane sphere,\nlacks leisure to express his disapproval in sulphuric person. He tenders\nhis apologies, sir, and sends in his stead your servant, with whose\ncapabilities he is indifferently acquainted.\"\n\n\"To drop this mummery,\" says Lord Humphrey, \"what are you doing in my\nlodgings?\"\n\n\"O Lord, sir!\" I responded, \"I came thither, I confess, without invitation.\nAnd with equal candor I will admit that my present need is of your\nLordship's banknotes and jewels, and such-like trifles, rather than--you\nforce me, sir, to say it,--rather than of your company.\"\n\nThus speaking, I drew and placed myself on guard, while my Lord gasped.\n\n\"You're the most impudent rogue,\" says he, after he had recovered himself a\nlittle, \"that I have had the privilege of meeting--\"\n\n\"Your Lordship is all kindness,\" I protested.\n\n\"--but your impudence is worth the price of whatever you may have pilfered.\nGo, my good man--or devil, if you so prefer to style yourself! Tell Lucifer\nthat he is well served; and obligingly return to the infernal regions\nwithout delay. For, as you have doubtless learned, Miss and I have many\nprivate matters to discuss. And, gad, Mr. Moloch, [Footnote: A deity of,\nI believe, Ammonitish origin. His traditional character as represented\nby our immortal Milton is both taking to the fancy and finely romantic;\nand is, I am informed, no less remarkable for many happy turns of speech\nthan for conformity throughout to the most famous legends of Talmudic\nfabrication.--F.A.] pleasant as is your conversation, you must acknowledge\nI can't allow evil spirits about the house without getting it an ill\nreputation. So pardon me if I exorcise you with this.\"\n\nHe spoke boldly, and, as he ended, tossed me a purse. I let it lie where it\nfell, for I had by no means ended my argument.\n\n\"Yet, sir,\" said I, \"my errand, which began with the acquisition of your\npins, studs and other jewelry, now reaches toward treasure far more\nprecious--\"\n\n\"Enough!\" he cried, impatiently, \"Begone! and do you render thanks--that my\npresent business is so urgent as to prevent my furnishing the rope which\nwill one day adorn your neck.\"\n\n\"That's as may be,\" quoth I; \"and, indeed, I doubt if I could abide\ndrowning, for 'tis a damp, unwholesome, and very permanent sort of death.\nBut my fixed purpose, to cut short all debate, is to escort Miss Allonby\nhomeward.\"\n\n\"Come,\" sneers my Lord,--\"come, Mr. Moloch, I have borne with your\ninsolence for a quarter of an hour--\"\n\n\"Twenty minutes,\" said I, after consulting my watch.\n\n\"--but I mean to put up with it no longer; and in consequence I take the\nboorish liberty of suggesting that this is none of your affair.\"\n\n\"Good sir,\" I conceded, \"your Lordship speaks with considerable justice,\nand we must leave the final decision to Miss here.\"\n\nI bowed toward her. In her face there was a curious bewilderment that\nmade me fear lest, for all my mask, for all my unnatural intonations, and\nfor all the room's half-light, my worshipped mistress had come near to\nrecognizing this caught thief.\n\n\"Miss Allonby,\" said I, in a falsetto voice which trembled, \"since I am\nunknown to you, may I trust you will permit me to present myself? My\nname--though, indeed, I have a multitude of names--is for the occasion\nFrederick Thomasson. With my father's appellation and estates I cannot\naccommodate you, for the reason that a mystery attaches to his identity.\nAs for my mother, let it suffice to say that she was a vivacious brunette\nof a large acquaintance, and generally known to the public as Black Moll\nO'Reilly. I began life as a pickpocket. Since then I have so far improved\nmy natural gifts that the police are flattering enough to value my person\nat several hundred pounds. My rank in society, as you perceive, is not\nexalted; yet, if my luck by any chance should fail, I do not question that\nI shall, upon some subsequent Friday, move in loftier circles than any\nnobleman who happens at the time to be on Tyburn Hill.--So much for my poor\nself. And since by this late hour Lady Allonby is beyond doubt beginning to\ngrow uneasy, let us have done with further exposition, and remember that\n'tis high time you selected an escort to her residence. May I implore that\nyou choose between the son of the Marquis of Venour and Black Molly's\nbastard?\"\n\nShe looked us over,--first one, then the other. More lately she laughed;\nand if I had never seen her before, I could have found it in my heart to\nlove her for the sweet insolence of her demeanor.\n\n\"After all,\" said my adored Dorothy, \"I prefer the rogue who when he goes\nabout his knaveries has at least the decency to wear a mask.\"\n\n\"That, my Lord,\" said I, \"is fairly conclusive; and so we will be\njourneying.\"\n\n\"Over my dead body!\" says he.\n\n\"Sure, and what's beneath the feet,\" I protested, \"is equally beneath\nconsideration.\"\n\nThe witticism stung him like a wasp, and, with an oath, he drew, as I was\nheartily glad to observe, for I cannot help thinking that when it comes to\nthe last pinch, and one gentleman is excessively annoyed by the existence\nof another, steel is your only arbiter, and charitable allowances for the\ndead make the one rational peroration. So we crossed blades; and, pursuing\nmy usual tactics, I began upon a flow of words, which course, as I have\nlearned by old experience, is apt to disconcert an adversary far more than\nany trick of the sword can do.\n\nI pressed him sorely, and he continued to give way, but clearly for\ntactical purposes, and without permitting the bright flash of steel that\nprotected him to swerve an instant from the proper line.\n\n\"Miss Allonby,\" said I, growing impatient, \"have you never seen a venomous\ninsect pinned to the wall? In that case, I pray you to attend more closely.\nFor one has only to parry--thus! And to thrust--in this fashion! And\nbehold, the thing is done!\"\n\nIn fact, having been run through the chest, my Lord was for the moment\naffixed to the panelling at the extreme end of the apartment, where he\nwrithed, much in the manner of a cockchafer which mischievous urchins have\npinned to a card,--his mien and his gesticulations, however, being rather\nmore suggestive of the torments of the damned, as they are so strikingly\ndepicted by the Italian Dante. [Footnote: I allude, of course, to the\nfamous Florentine, who excels no less in his detailed depictions of\ninfernal anguish than in his eloquent portrayal of the graduated and\nequitable emoluments of an eternal glorification.--F.A.] He tumbled in a\nheap, though, when I sheathed my sword and bowed toward my charmer.\n\n\"Miss Allonby,\" said I, \"thus quickly ends this evil quarter of an hour;\nand with, equal expedition, I think, should we be leaving this evil quarter\nof the town.\"\n\nShe had watched the combat with staring and frightened eyes. Now she had\ndrawn nearer, and she looked curiously at her over-presumptuous lover where\nhe had fallen.\n\n\"Have you killed him?\" she asked, in a hushed voice.\n\n\"O Lord, no!\" I protested. \"The life of a peer's son is too valuable a\nmatter; he will be little the worse for it in a week.\"\n\n\"The dog!\" cries she, overcome with pardonable indignation at the affront\nwhich the misguided nobleman had put upon her; and afterward, with a\nferocity the more astounding in an individual whose demeanor was by\nordinary of an aspect so amiable and so engaging, she said, \"Oh, the lewd\nthieving dog!\"\n\n\"My adorable Miss Allonby,\" said I, \"do not, I pray you, thus slander the\ncanine species! Meanwhile, permit me to remind you that 'tis inexpedient\nto loiter in these parts, for the parson will presently be at hand; and if\nit be to inter rather than to marry Lord Humphrey--well, after all, the\npeerage is a populous estate! But, either way, time presses.\"\n\n\"Come!\" said she, and took my arm; and together we went down-stairs and\ninto the street.\n\n\nIV\n\nOn the way homeward she spoke never a word. Vanringham had made a hasty\nflitting when my Lord's people arrived, so that we saw nothing of him. But\nwhen we had come safely to Lady Allonby's villa, Dorothy began to laugh.\n\n\"Captain Audaine,\" says she, in a wearied and scornful voice, \"I know that\nthe hour is very late, yet there are certain matters to be settled between\nas which will, I think, scarcely admit of delay. I pray you, then, grant me\nten minutes' conversation.\"\n\nShe had known me all along, you see. Trust the dullest woman to play\nOedipus when love sets the riddle. So there was nothing to do save clap my\nmask into my pocket and follow her, sheepishly enough, toward one of the\nsalons, where at Dorothy's solicitation a gaping footman made a light for\nus.\n\nShe left me there to kick my heels through a solitude of some moments'\nextent. But in a while my dear mistress came into the room, with her arms\nfull of trinkets and knick-knacks, which she flung upon a table.\n\n\"Here's your ring, Captain Audaine,\" says she, and drew it from her finger.\n\"I did not wear it long, did I? And here's the miniature you gave me, too.\nI used to kiss it every night, you know. And here's a flower you dropped at\nLady Pevensey's. I picked it up--oh, very secretly!--because you had worn\nit, you understand. And here's--\"\n\nBut at this point she fairly broke down; and she cast her round white arms\nabout the heap of trinkets, and strained them close to her, and bowed her\nimperious golden head above them in anguish.\n\n\"Oh, how I loved you--how I loved you!\" she sobbed. \"And all the while you\nwere only a common thief!\"\n\n\"Dorothy--!\" I pleaded.\n\n\"You shame me--you shame me past utterance!\" she cried, in a storm of\nmingled tears and laughter. \"Here's this bold Captain Audaine, who comes to\nTunbridge from nobody knows where, and wins a maid's love, and proves in\nthe end a beggarly house-breaker! Mr. Garrick might make a mirthful comedy\nof this, might he not?\" Then she rose to her feet very stiffly. \"Take your\ngifts, Mr. Thief,\" says she, pointing,--\"take them. And for God's sake let\nme not see you again!\"\n\nSo I was forced to make a clean breast of it.\n\n\"Dorothy,\" said I, \"ken ye the rhyme to porringer?\" But she only stared at\nme through unshed tears.\n\nPresently, though, I hummed over the old song:\n\n    \"Ken ye the rhyme to porringer?\n  Ken ye the rhyme to porringer?\n  King James the Seventh had ae daughter,\n  And he gave her to an Oranger.\n\n\"And the Oranger filched his crown,\" said I, \"and drove King James--God\nbless him!--out of his kingdom. This was a while and a half ago, my dear;\nbut Dutch William left the stolen crown to Anne, and Anne, in turn, left it\nto German George. So that now the Elector of Hanover reigns at St. James's,\nwhile the true King's son must skulk in France, with never a roof to\nshelter him. And there are certain gentlemen, Dorothy, who do not consider\nthat this is right.\"\n\n\"You are a Jacobite?\" said she. \"Well! and what have your politics to do\nwith the matter?\"\n\n\"Simply that Lord Humphrey is not of my way of thinking, my dearest dear.\nLord Humphrey--pah!--this Degge is Ormskirk's spy, I tell you! He followed\nVanringham to Tunbridge on account of our business. And to-day, when\nVanringham set out for Avignon, he was stopped a mile from the Wells by\nsome six of Lord Humphrey's fellows, disguised as highwaymen, and all his\npapers were stolen. Oho, but Lord Humphrey is a thrifty fellow: so when\nOrmskirk puts six bandits at his disposal he employs them in double infamy,\nto steal you as well as Vanringham's despatches. To-morrow they would have\nbeen in Ormskirk's hands. And then--\" I paused to allow myself a whistle.\n\nShe came a little toward me, in the prettiest possible glow of\nbewilderment, \"I do not understand,\" she murmured. \"Oh, Frank, Frank, for\nthe love of God, beware of trusting Vanringham in anything! And you are not\na thief, after all? Are you really not named Thomasson?\"\n\n\"I am most assuredly not Frederick Thomasson,\" said I, \"nor do I know if\nany such person exists, for I never heard the name before to-night. Yet, in\nspite of this, I am an unmitigated thief. Why, d'ye not understand? What\nVanringham carried was a petition from some two hundred Scotch and English\ngentlemen that our gracious Prince Charlie be pleased to come over and\ntake back his own from the Elector. 'Twas rebellion, flat rebellion, and\nthe very highest treason! Had Ormskirk seen the paper, within a month our\nheads had all been blackening over Temple Bar. So I stole it,--I, Francis\nAudaine, stole it in the King's cause, God bless him! 'Twas burglary, no\nless, but it saved two hundred lives, my own included; and I look to be a\ndeal older than I am before I regret the deed with any sincerity.\"\n\nAfterward I showed her the papers, and then burned them one by one over a\ncandle. She said nothing. So by and by I turned toward her with a little\nbow.\n\n\"Madam,\" said I, \"you have forced my secret from me. I know that your\nfamily is staunch on the Whig side; and yet, ere the thief goes, may he not\ntrust you will ne'er betray him?\"\n\nAnd now she came to me, all penitence and dimples.\n\n\"But it was you who said you were a thief,\" my dear mistress pointed out.\n\n\"O Lord, madam!\" said I, \"'twas very necessary that Degge should think me\nso. A house-breaker they would have only hanged, but a Jacobite they would\nhave hanged and quartered afterward.\"\n\n\"Ah, Frank, do not speak of such fearful matters, but forgive me\ninstantly!\" she wailed.\n\nAnd I was about to do so in what I considered the most agreeable and\nappropriate manner when the madcap broke away from me, and sprang upon a\nfootstool and waved her fan defiantly.\n\n\"Down with the Elector!\" she cried, in her high, sweet voice. \"Long live\nKing James!\"\n\nAnd then, with a most lovely wildness of mien, she began to sing:\n\n    \"Ken ye the rhyme to porringer?\n  Ken ye the rhyme to porringer?\n  King James the Seventh had ae daughter--\"\n\nuntil I interrupted her. For, \"Extraordinary creature!\" I pleaded, \"you\nwill rouse the house.\"\n\n\"I don't care! I intend to be a Jacobite if you are one!\"\n\n\"Eh, well,\" said I, \"Frank Audaine is not the man to coerce his wife in a\npolitical matter. Nevertheless, I know of a certain Jacobite who is not\nunlikely to have a bad time of it if by any chance Lord Humphrey recognized\nhim to-night. Nay, Miss, you may live to be a widow yet.\"\n\n\"But he didn't recognize you. And if he did\"--she snapped her\nfingers,--\"why, we'll fight him again, you and I. Won't we, my dear? For\nhe stole our secret, you know. And he stole me, too. Very pretty behavior,\nwasn't it?\" And here Miss, Allonby stamped the tiniest, the most\ninfinitesimal of red-heeled slippers.\n\n  \"The rogue he didna keep me lang,\n  To budge we made him fain again--\n\n\"that's you, Frank, and your great, long sword. And now:\n\n  \"We'll hang him high, upon a tree,\n  And King Frank shall hae his ain again!\"\n\nAfterward my adored Dorothy jumped from the footstool, and came toward me,\nlifting up the crimson trifle that she calls her mouth, \"So take your own,\nmy king,\" she breathed, with a wonderful gesture of surrender.\n\nAnd a gentleman could do no less.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nACTORS ALL\n\n\n_As Played at Tunbridge Wells, April 3, 1750_\n\n\"_I am thinking if some little, filching, inquisitive poet should get my\nstory, and represent it to the stage, what those ladies who are never\nprecise but at a play would say of me now,--that I were a confident, coming\npiece, I warrant, and they would damn the poor poet for libelling the\nsex._\"\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6\n\nDUKE OF ORMSKIRK.\n\nCOLONEL DENSTROUDE,  }\nSIR GRESLEY CARNE,   } Gentlemen of the town.\nMR.

LANGTON, secretary to Ormskirk.\n\nMISS ALLONBY, an heiress, loves Captain Audaine.\n\nLOTTRUM, maid to Miss Allonby.\n\nBENYON, MINCHIN, and OTHER SERVANTS to Ormskirk.\n\n\nSCENE\n\nTunbridge Wells, shifting from Ormskirk's lodgings at the _Mitre_ to\nVanringham's apartments in the _Three Gudgeons_.\n\n\n\n\nACTORS ALL\n\n\n_PROEM.--To Explain Why the Heroine of This Comedy Must Wear Her Best_\n\nI quit pilfering from the writings of Francis Audaine, since in the\nhappenings which now concern us he plays but a subsidiary part. The Captain\nhad an utter faith in decorum, and therefore it was, as he records, an\nearth-staggering shock when the following day, on the Pantiles, in full\nsight of the best company at the Wells, Captain Audaine was apprehended. He\nmet disaster like an old acquaintance, and hummed a scrap of song--\"_O, gin\nI were a bonny bird_,\"--and shrugged; but when Miss Allonby, with whom he\nhad been chatting, swayed and fell, the Captain caught her in his arms, and\nstanding thus, turned angrily upon the emissaries of the law.\n\n\"Look you, you rascals,\" said he, \"you have spoiled a lady's afternoon with\nyour foolish warrant!\"\n\nHe then relinquished the unconscious girl to her brother's keeping,\ntenderly kissed one insensate hand, and afterward strolled off to jail\n_en route_ for a perfunctory trial and a subsequent traffic with the\nexecutioner that Audaine did not care to think of.\n\nTunbridge buzzed like a fly-trap with the ensuing rumors. The Captain\nwas at the head of a most heinous Jacobitical uprising. The great Duke\nof Ormskirk was come hastily from London on the business. Highlanders\nwere swarming over the Border, ten thousand French troops had landed at\nPevensey, commanded by the Chevalier St. George in person, and twenty\nthousand friars and pilgrims from Coru\u00f1a had sailed for Milford Haven,\nunder the admiralty of young Henry Stuart. The King was locked in the\nTower; the King had been assassinated that morning by a Spanish monk, with\nhorse-pistols and a cast in his left eye; and the King and the Countess of\nYarmouth had escaped three days ago, in disguise, and were now on their way\nto Hanover.\n\nThese were the reports which went about Tunbridge, while Dorothy Allonby\nwept a little and presently called for cold water and a powder-puff, and\nafterward for a sedan chair.\n\n\nI\n\nMiss Allonby found my Lord Duke of Ormskirk deep in an infinity of papers.\nBut at her entrance he rose and with a sign dismissed his secretary.\n\nIt appears appropriate here to afford you some notion of Ormskirk's\nexterior. I pilfer from L\u00f6we's memoir of him, where Horace Calverley, who\nfirst saw Ormskirk at about this time, is quoted:\n\n\"His Grace was in blue-and-silver, which became him, though he is somewhat\nstomachy for such conspicuous colors. A handsome man, I would have said,\nhonest but not particularly intelligent.... Walpole, in a fit of spleen,\nonce called him 'a porcelain sphinx,' and the phrase sticks; but,\nindeed, there is more of the china-doll about him. He possesses the\nsame too-perfect complexion, his blue eyes have the same spick-and-span\nvacuity; and the fact that the right orb is a trifle larger than its fellow\ngives his countenance, in repose, much the same expression of placid\nastonishment.... Very plump, very sleepy-looking, immaculate as a cat, you\nwould never have accorded him a second glance: covert whisperings that the\nstout gentleman yonder is the great Duke of Ormskirk have, I think, taxed\nhuman belief more than once during these ten years past.\"\n\nThey said of Ormskirk that he manifested a certain excitement on the\nday after Culloden, when he had seventy-two prisoners shot _en masse_,\n[Footnote: But for all that, when, near Rossinish (see L\u00f6we), he captured\nFlora Macdonald and her ostensibly female companion, Ormskirk flatly\ndeclined to recognize Prince Charles. \"They may well call you the\nPretender, madam,\" he observed to \"Bettie Burke,\"--\"since as concerns my\nparty you are the most desirable Pretender we could possibly imagine.\" And\nthereupon he gave the Prince a pass out of Scotland.] but this was doubted;\nand in any event, such _battues_ being comparatively rare, he by ordinary\nappeared to regard the universe with a composed and feline indifference.\n\n\nII\n\n\"Child, child!\" Ormskirk began, and made a tiny gesture of deprecation, \"I\nperceive you are about to appeal to my better nature, and so I warn you in\nadvance that the idiotic business has worked me into a temper absolutely\nogreish.\"\n\n\"The Jacobite conspiracy, you mean?\" said Miss Allonby. \"Oh, I suppose\nso. I am not particularly interested in such matters, though; I came, you\nunderstand, for a warrant, or an order, or whatever you call it, for them\nto let Frank out of that horrid filthy gaol.\"\n\nThe Duke's face was gravely humorous as he gazed at her for a moment or two\nin silence, \"You know quite well,\" he said at last, \"that I can give you\nnothing of the sort.\"\n\nMiss Allonby said: \"Upon my word, I never heard of such nonsense! How else\nis he to take me to Lady Mackworth's ball to-night?\"\n\n\"It is deplorable,\" his Grace of Ormskirk conceded, \"that Captain Audaine\nshould be thus snatched from circles which he, no doubt, adorns. Still, I\nfear you must look for another escort; and frankly, child, if you will be\nadvised by me, you will permit us to follow out our present intentions and\ntake off his head--not a great deprivation when you consider he has so\nplainly demonstrated its contents to be of such inferior quality.\"\n\nShe had drawn close to him, with widening, pitiable eyes. \"You mean, then,\"\nshe demanded, \"that Frank's very life is in danger?\"\n\n\"This is unfair,\" the Duke complained. \"You are about to go into hysterics\nforthwith and thus bully me into letting the man escape. You are a minx.\nYou presume upon the fact that in the autumn I am to wed your kinswoman and\nbosom companion, and that my affection for her is widely known to go well\npast the frontier of common-sense; and also upon the fact that Marian will\ngive me the devil if I don't do exactly as you ask. I consider you to abuse\nyour power unconscionably, I consider you to be a second Delilah. However,\nsince you insist upon it, this Captain Audaine must, of course, be spared\nthe fate he very richly merits.\"\n\nMiss Allonby had seated herself beside a table and was pensively looking\nup at him. \"Naturally,\" she said, \"Marian and I, between us, will badger\nyou into saving Frank. I shall not worry, therefore, and I must trust to\nProvidence, I suppose, to arrange matters so that the poor boy will not\ncatch his death of cold in your leaky gaol yonder. And now I would like to\nbe informed of what he has been most unjustly accused.\"\n\n\"His crime,\" the Duke retorted, \"is the not unusual one of being a fool.\nOh, I am candid! All Jacobites are fools. We gave the Stuarts a fair trial,\nHeaven knows, and nobody but a fool would want them back.\"\n\n\"I am not here to discuss politics,\" a dignified Miss Allonby stated, \"but\nsimply to find out in what way Frank has been slandered.\"\n\nOrmskirk lifted one eyebrow. \"It is not altogether a matter of politics.\nRather, as I see it, it is a matter of common-sense. Under the Stuarts\nEngland was a prostitute among the nations, lackey in turn to Spain and\nFrance and Italy; under the Guelph the Three-per-cents. are to-day at par.\nThe question as to which is preferable thus resolves itself into a choice\nbetween common-sense and bedlamite folly. But, unhappily, you cannot argue\nwith a Jacobite: only four years ago Cumberland and Hawley and I rode from\nAberdeen to the Highlands and left all the intervening country bare as the\npalm of your hand; I forget how many Jacobites we killed, but evidently not\nenough to convince the others. Very well: we intend to have no more such\nnonsense, and we must settle this particular affair by the simple device\nof hanging or beheading every man-Jack concerned in it.\" He spoke without\nvehemence--rather regretfully than otherwise.\n\nMiss Allonby was patient, yet resolute to keep to the one really important\npoint. \"But what has Frank been accused of doing when it never even entered\nhis head?\"\n\n\"He has been conspiring,\" said the Duke, \"and with conspicuous clumsiness.\nIt appears, child, that it was their common idiocy which of late brought\ntogether some two hundred gentlemen in Lancashire. Being every one of them\nmost unmitigated fools, they desired that sot at Avignon to come over once\nmore and 'take back his own,' as the saying is. He would not stir without\ndefinite assurances. So these men drew up a petition pledging their all to\nthe Chevalier's cause and--God help us!--signed it. I protest,\" the Duke\nsighed, \"I cannot understand these people! A couple of penstrokes, you\nobserve, and there is your life at the mercy of chance, at the disposal of\na puff of wind or the first blunderer who stumbles on the paper.\"\n\n\"Doubtless that is entirely true,\" said Miss Allonby, \"but what about\nFrank?\"\n\nOrmskirk shrugged his shoulders and began to laugh. \"You are an\nincomparable actress, you rogue you. But let us be candid, for all that,\nsince as it happens Lord Humphrey is not the only person in my employ. What\noccurred last night I now partly know, and in part guess, Degge played a\nbold game, and your Captain gambled even more impudently,--only the stakes,\nas it to-day transpires, were of somewhat less importance than either of\nthem surmised. For years Mr. Vanringham has been a Jacobite emissary; now\nhe tires of it; and so he devoted the entire morning, yesterday to making a\ncopy of this absurd petition.\"\n\n\"I do not understand,\" said Miss Allonby; and in appearance, at least, she\nwas no whit disconcerted.\n\n\"He carried only the copy. You burned only the copy. Mr. Vanringham, it\ndevelops, knew well enough what that bungling Degge had been deputed to\ndo, and he preferred to treat directly with Lord Humphrey's principal. Mr.\nVanringham is an intelligent fellow. I dare make this assertion, because\nI am fresh from an interview with Mr. Vanringham,\" his Grace of Ormskirk\nended, and allowed himself a reminiscent chuckle.\n\nShe had risen. \"O ungenerous! this Vanringham has been bribed!\"\n\n\"I pray you,\" said the Duke, \"give vent to no such scandal. Vanringham's\nlife would not be worth a farthing if he had done such a thing, and he\nknows it. Nay, I have planned it more neatly. To-night Mr. Vanringham will\nbe arrested--merely on suspicion, mind you,--and all his papers will be\nbrought to me; and it is possible that among them we may find the petition.\nAnd it is possible that, somehow, when he is tried with the others, Mr.\nVanringham alone may be acquitted. And it is possible that an aunt--in\nWales, say,--may die about this time and leave him a legacy of some five\nthousand pounds. Oh, yes, all this is quite possible,\" said the Duke;\n\"but should we therefore shriek _Bribery_? For my own part, I esteem Mr.\nVanringham, as the one sensible man in the two hundred.\"\n\n\"He has turned King's evidence,\" she said, \"and his papers will be brought\nto you--\" Miss Allonby paused. \"All his papers!\" said Miss Allonby.\n\n\"And very curious they will prove, no doubt,\" said his Grace. \"So many\nlove-sick misses write to actors. I can assure you, child, I look\nforward with a deal of interest to my inspection of Mr. Vanringham's\ncorrespondence.\"\n\n\"Eh?--Oh, yes!\" Miss Allonby assented--\"all his papers! Yes, they should be\ndiverting, I must be going home though, to make ready for Lady Mackworth's\nball. And if I have nobody to dance with me, I shall know quite well whose\nfault it is. How soon will Frank be freed, you odious tyrant?\"\n\n\"My child, but in these matters we are all slaves to red tape! I can\npromise you, however, that your Captain will be released from prison before\nthis month is out, so you are not to worry.\"\n\n\nIII\n\nWhen she had left him the Duke sat for a while in meditation.\n\n\"That is an admirable girl, I would I could oblige her in the matter and\nlet this Audaine live. But such folly is out of the question. The man is\nthe heart of the conspiracy.\n\n\"No, Captain Audaine, I am afraid we must have that handsome head of yours,\nand set your spirit free before this month is out. And your head also, Mr.\nVanringham, when we are done with using your evidence. This affair must be\nthe last; hitherto we have tried leniency, and it has failed; now we will\ntry extermination. Not one of these men must escape.\n\n\"I shall have trouble with Marian, since the two girls are inseparable.\nYes, this Audaine will cause me some trouble with Marian. I heartily wish\nthe fellow had never been born.\"\n\nOrmskirk took a miniature from his pocket and sat thus in the dusk\nregarding it. It was the portrait of a young girl with hazel eyes and\nabundant hair the color of a dead oak-leaf. And now his sleepy face was\ncuriously moved.\n\n\"I shall have to lie to you. And you will believe me, for you are not\ndisastrously clever. But I wish it were not necessary, my dear. I wish it\nwere possible to make you understand that my concern is to save England\nrather than a twopenny captain. As it is, I shall lie to you, and you will\nbelieve. And Dorothy will get over it in time, as one gets over everything\nin time. But I wish it were not necessary, sweetheart.\n\n\"I wish.... I wish that I were not so happy when I think of you. I become\nso happy that I grow afraid. It is not right that anyone should be so\nhappy.\n\n\"Bah! I am probably falling into my dotage.\"\n\nOrmskirk struck upon the gong. \"And now, Mr. Langton, let us get back to\nbusiness.\"\n\n\nIV\n\nLater in the afternoon Miss Allonby demanded of her maid if Gerald Allonby\nwere within, and received a negative response. \"Nothing could be better,\"\nsaid Miss Allonby. \"You know that new suit of Master Gerald's, Lottrum--the\npink-and-silver? Very well; then you will do thus, and thus, and thus--\"\nAnd she poured forth a series of directions that astonished her maid not a\nlittle.\n\n\"Law you now!\" said Lottrum, \"whatever--?\"\n\n\"If you ask me any questions,\" said Dorothy, \"I will discharge you on the\nspot. And if you betray me, I shall probably kill you.\"\n\nLottrum said, \"O Gemini!\" and did as her mistress ordered.\n\nMiss Allonby made a handsome boy, and such was her one comfort. Her mirror\nshowed an epicene denizen of romance,--Rosalind or Bellario, a frail\nand lovely travesty of boyhood; but it is likely that the girl's heart\nshowed stark terror. Here was imminent no jaunt into Arden, but into the\ngross jaws of even bodily destruction. Here was probable dishonor, a\nguaranteeable death. She could fence well enough, thanks to many bouts with\nGerald; but when the foils were unbuttoned, there was a difference which\nthe girl could appreciate.\n\n\"In consequence,\" said Dorothy, \"I had better hurry before I am still more\nafraid.\"\n\n\nV\n\nSo there came that evening, after dusk, to Mr. Francis Vanringham's\napartments, at the _Three Gudgeons_, a young spark in pink-and-silver. He\nappeared startled at the sight of so much company, recovered his composure\nwith a gulp, and presented himself to the assembled gentlemen as Mr.\nOsric Allonby, unexpectedly summoned from Cambridge, and in search of\nhis brother, Squire Gerald. At his step-mother's villa they had imagined\nGerald might be spending the evening with Mr. Vanringham. Mr. Osric\nAllonby apologized for the intrusion; was their humble servant; and with a\nprofusion of _cong\u00e9es_ made as though to withdraw.\n\nMr. Vanringham lounged forward. The comedian had a vogue among the younger\nmen, since at all games of chance they found him untiring and tolerably\nhonest; and his apartments were, in effect, a gambling parlor.\n\nVanringham now took the boy's hand very genially. \"You have somewhat the\nlook of your sister,\" he observed, after a prolonged appraisal; \"though, in\nnature, 'tis not expected of us trousered folk to be so beautiful. And by\nyour leave, you'll not quit us thus unceremoniously, Master Osric. I am by\nway of being a friend of your brother's, and 'tis more than possible that\nhe may during the evening honor us with his presence. Will you not linger\nawhile on the off-chance?\" And Osric Allonby admitted he had no other\nengagements.\n\nHe was in due form made known to the three gentlemen--Colonel Denstroude,\n[Footnote: He and Vanringham had just been reconciled by Molly Yates'\nelopement with Tom Stoach, the Colonel's footman. Garendon has a curious\nanecdote concerning this lady, apropos of his notorious duel with\nDenstroude, in '61.] Mr. Babington-Herle, and Sir Gresley Carne--who sat\nover a bowl of punch. Sir Gresley was then permitted to conclude the\nnarrative which Mr. Allonby's entrance had interrupted: the evening\nprevious, being a little tipsy, Sir Gresley had strolled about Tunbridge in\nsearch of recreation and, with perhaps excessive playfulness, had slapped\na passer-by, broken the fellow's nose, and gouged both thumbs into the\nrascal's eyes. The young baronet conceded the introduction of these London\npastimes into the rural quiet of Tunbridge to have been an error in taste,\nespecially as the man proved upon inquiry to be a respectable haberdasher\nand the sole dependence of four children; and having thus unfortunately\nblinded the little tradesman, Sir Gresley wished to ask of the assembled\ncompany what in their opinion was a reasonable reparation. \"For I sincerely\nregret the entire affair,\" Sir Gresley concluded, \"and am desirous to\nfollow a course approvable by all men of honor.\"\n\n\"Heyho!\" said Mr. Vanringham, \"I'm afraid the rape of both eyes was a\ntrifle extreme; for by ordinary a haberdasher is neither a potato nor an\nArgus, and, remembering that, even the high frivolity of brandy-and-water\nshould have respected his limitations.\"\n\nThe hands of Mr. Allonby had screened his face during the recital, \"Oh, the\npoor man!\" he said, \"I cannot bear--\" And then, with swift alteration,\nhe tossed back his head, and laughed. \"Are we gentlemen to be denied all\namusement? Sir Gresley acted quite within his privilege, and in terming him\nsevere you have lied, Mr. Vanringham. I repeat, sir, you have lied!\"\n\nVanringham was on his feet within the instant, but Colonel Denstroude, who\nsat beside him, laid a heavy hand upon Vanringham's arm. \"'Oons, man,\" says\nthe Colonel, \"infanticide is a crime.\"\n\nThe actor shrugged his shoulders, \"Doubtless you are in the right, Mr.\nAllonby,\" he said; \"though, as you were of course going on to remark, you\nexpress yourself somewhat obscurely. Your meaning, I take it, is that I\nmayn't criticise the doings, of my guests? I stand corrected, and concede\nSir Gresley acted with commendable moderation, and that Cambridge is,\nbeyond question, the paramount expositor of morals and manners.\"\n\nThe lad stared about him: with a bewildered face. \"La, will he not fight me\nnow?\" he demanded of Colonel Denstroude,--\"now, after I have called him a\nliar?\"\n\n\"My dear,\" the Colonel retorted, \"he may possibly deprive you of your\nnursing-bottle, or he may even birch you, but he will most assuredly not\nfight you, so long as I have any say in the affair. I' cod, we are all\nfriends here, I hope. D'ye think Mr. Vanringham has so often enacted\nRichard III. that to strangle infants is habitual with him? Fight you,\nindeed! 'Sdeath and devils!\" roared the Colonel, \"I will cut the throat of\nany man who dares to speak of fighting in this amicable company! Gi'me some\nmore punch,\" said the Colonel.\n\nAnd thereupon in silence Mr. Allonby resumed his seat.\n\nNow, to relieve the somewhat awkward tension, Mr. Vanringham cried: \"So\nbeing neighborly again, let us think no more of the recent difference in\nopinion. Pay your damned haberdasher what you like, Gresley; or, rather,\nlet Osric here fix the remuneration. I confess to all and sundry,\" he\nadded, with a smile, \"that I daren't say another word in the matter.\nFrankly, I'm afraid of this youngster. He breathes fire like \u00c6tna.\"\n\n\"He is a lad of spirit,\" said Mr. Babington-Herle, with an extreme\nsobriety. \"He's a lad eshtrornary spirit. Let's have game hazard.\"\n\n\"Agreed, good sir,\" said Vanringham, \"and I warn you, you will find me a\ndaring antagonist. I had to-day an extraordinary--the usual prejudice,\nmy dear Herle, is, I believe, somewhat inclined to that pronunciation of\nthe word,--the most extraordinary windfall. I am rich, and I protest King\nCroesus himself sha'n't intimidate me to-night. Come!\" he cried, and he\ndrew from his pocket a plump purse and emptied its contents upon the table;\n\"come, lay your wager!\"\n\n\"Hell and furies,\" the Colonel groaned, \"there's that tomfool boy again!\nGi'me some more punch.\"\n\nFor Osric Allonby had risen to his feet and had swept the littered gold\nand notes toward him. He stood thus, his pink-tipped fingers caressing\nthe money, while his eyes fixed those of Mr. Vanringham. \"And the chief\npriests,\" observed Osric Allonby, \"took the silver pieces and said, 'It is\nnot lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of\nblood.' Are they, then, fit to be touched by gentlemen, Mr.--ah, but I\nforget your given name?\"\n\nVanringham, too, had risen, his face changed. \"My sponsors in baptism were\npleased to christen me Francis.\"\n\n\"I entreat your pardon,\" the boy drawled, \"but I have the oddest fancies.\nI had thought it was Judas.\" And so they stood, warily regarding each the\nother, very much as strange dogs are wont to do at meeting.\n\n\"Boy is drunk,\" Mr. Babington-Herle explained at large, \"and presents to\npitying eye of disinterested spectator most deplorable results incidental\nto combination of immaturity and brandy. As to money, now, in Suetonius--\"\nAnd he launched upon a hiccough-punctuated anecdote of Vespasian, which to\nrecord here is not convenient. \"And moral of it is,\" Mr. Babington-Herle\nperorated, \"that all money is always fine thing to have. _Non olet!_\nClassical scholar, by Jove! Now let's have game hazard.\"\n\nMeanwhile those two had stood like statues. Vanringham seemed\nhalf-frightened, half persuaded that this unaccountable boy spoke at\nrandom. Talk, either way, the actor knew, was dangerous....\n\n\"I ask your forgiveness, gentlemen,\" said Francis Vanringham, \"but I'm\nsuddenly ill. If you'll permit me to retire--\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said. Mr. Babington-Herle; \"late in evening, as it is. We\nwill go,--Colonel and old Carne and I will go kill watchman. Persevorate\nhim, by Jove,--like sieve.\"\n\n\"I thank you,\" said Mr. Vanringham, withdrawing up the stairway toward his\nbedroom. \"I thank you. Mr. Allonby,\" he called, in a firmer tone, \"you and\nI have had some words together and you were the aggressor. Oho, I think we\nmay pass it over. I think--\"\n\nBelow, the four gentlemen were unhooking their swords from the wall. Mr.\nAllonby now smiled with cherubic sweetness. \"I, too,\" said he, \"think that\nall our differences might be arranged by ten minutes' private talk.\" He\ncame back, came up the stairs. \"You had left your sword,\" he said to Mr.\nVanringham, \"but I fetched it, you see.\"\n\nVanringham stared, his lips working oddly. \"I am no Siegfried,\" said he,\n\"and ordinarily my bedfellow is not cold and--deplorable defect in such\ncapacity!--somewhat unsympathetic steel.\"\n\n\"But you forget,\" the boy urged, \"that the room is public. And see, the\nhilt is set with jewels. Ah, Mr. Vanringham, let us beware how we lead\nothers into temptation--\" The door closed behind them.\n\n\nVI\n\nSaid Mr. Babington-Herle, judicially, \"That's eshtrornary boy--most\neshtrornary boy, and precisely unlike brother.\"\n\n\"You must remember,\" the Colonel pointed out, \"that since his marriage\nGerald is a reformed man; he has quite given up punks and hazard, they say,\nfor beer and cattle-raising.\"\n\n\"Well, but it is a sad thing to have a spirited tall rogue turn pimp to\nballs and rams, and Mrs. Lascelles will be inconsolable,\" Sir Gresley\nconsidered.--\"Hey, what's that? Did you not hear a noise up-stairs?\"\n\n\"I do not think,\" said the Colonel, \"that Mallison finds her so.--Yes,\ni'cod! I suppose that tipsy boy has turned over a table.\"\n\n\"But you astound me,\" Sir Gresley interrupted. \"The constant Mallison, of\nall persons!\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, my dear, they assure me that he has made over to her the\nheart and lodgings until lately occupied by Mrs. Roydon--Oh, the devil!\"\ncried Colonel Denstroude, \"they are fighting above!\"\n\n\"Good for Frank!\" observed Mr. Babington-Herle. \"Hip-hip! Stick young\nrascal! Persevorate him, by Jove!\"\n\nBut the other men had run hastily up the stairway and were battering at\nthe door of Vanringham's chamber. \"Locked!\" said the Colonel. \"Oh, the\nunutterable cur! Open, open, I tell you, Vanringham! By God, I'll have your\nblood for this if you have hurt the boy!\"\n\n\"Break in the door!\" said a voice from below. The Colonel paused in his\nobjurgations, and found that the Duke of Ormskirk, followed by four\nattendants, had entered the hallway of the _Three Gudgeons_. \"Benyon,\" said\nthe Duke, more sharply, and wheeled upon his men, \"you have had my orders,\nI believe. Break in yonder door!\"\n\nThis was done. They found Mr. Francis Vanringham upon the hearthrug a\ntousled heap of flesh and finery, insensible, with his mouth gaping,\nin a great puddle of blood. To the rear of the room was a boy in\npink-and-silver, beside the writing-desk he had just got into with the\nco-operation of a poker. Hugged to his breast he held a brown despatch-box.\n\nOrmskirk strode toward the boy and with an inhalation paused. The Duke\nstood tense for a moment. Then silently he knelt beside the prostrate actor\nand inspected Vanringham's injury. \"You have killed him,\" the Duke said at\nlast.\n\n\"I think so,\" said the boy. \"But 'twas in fair fight.\"\n\nThe Duke rose. \"Benyon,\" he rapped out, \"do you and Minchin take this body\nto the room below. Let a surgeon be sent for. Bring word if he find any\nsign of life. Gentlemen, I must ask you to avoid the chamber. This is a\nstate matter. I am responsible for yonder person.\"\n\n\"Then your Grace is responsible for perfectly irresponsible young villain!\"\nsaid Mr. Babington-Herle. \"He's murderer Frank Vanringham, of poor dear\nFrank, like a brother to me, by Jove! Hang him high's Haman, your Grace,\nand then we'll have another bottle.\"\n\n\"Colonel Denstroude,\" said the Duke, \"I will ask you to assist your friend\nin retiring. The stairs are steep, and his conviviality, I fear, has by a\npint or so exceeded his capacity. And in fine--I wish you a good-evening,\ngentlemen.\"\n\n\nVII\n\nOrmskirk closed the door; then he turned, \"I lack words,\" the Duke said.\n\"Oh, believe me, speech fails before this spectacle. To find you, here,\nat this hour! To find you--my betrothed wife's kinswoman and life-long\nassociate,--here, in this garb! A slain man at your feet, his blood yet\nreeking upon that stolen sword! His papers--pardon me!\"\n\nOrmskirk sprang forward and caught the despatch-box from her grasp as she\nstrove to empty its contents into the fire. \"Pardon me,\" he repeated;\n\"you have unsexed yourself; do not add high treason to the list of your\nmisdemeanors. Mr. Vanringham's papers, as I have previously had the honor\nto inform you, are the state's property.\"\n\nShe stood with void and inefficient hands that groped vaguely. \"I could\ntrust no one,\" she said. \"I have fenced so often with Gerald. I was not\nafraid--at least, I was not very much afraid.. And 'twas so difficult to\ndraw him into a quarrel,--he wanted to live, because at last he had the\nmoney his dirty little soul had craved. Ah, I had sacrificed so many things\nto get these papers, my Lord Duke,--and now you rob me of them. You!\"\n\nThe Duke bent pitiless brows upon her. \"I rob you of them,\" he said,--\"ay,\nI am discourteous and I rob, but not for myself alone. For your confusion\ntells me that I hold here between my hands the salvation of England. Child,\nchild!\" he cried, in sudden tenderness, \"I trusted you to-day, and could\nyou not trust me? I promised you the life of the man you love. I promised\nyou--\" He broke off, as if in a rivalry of rage and horror. \"And you\nbetrayed me! You came hither, trousered and shameless, to save these\nhare-brained traitors! Well, but at worst your treachery has very happily\nreleased me from my promise to meddle in the fate of this Audaine. I shall\nnot lift a finger now. And I warn you that within the week your precious\nCaptain will have become the associate of seraphim.\"\n\nShe had heard him, with defiant eyes; her head was flung back and she\nlaughed. \"You thought I had come to destroy the Jacobite petition! Heavens,\nwhat had I to do with all such nonsense? You had promised me Frank's\npardon, and the other men I had never seen. Harkee, my Lord Duke, do all\nyou politicians jump so wildly in your guess work? Did you in truth believe\nthat the poor fool who lies dead below would have entrusted the paper which\nmeant life and wealth to the keeping of a flimsy despatch-box?\"\n\n\"Indeed, no,\" his Grace of Ormskirk replied, and appeared a thought\nabashed; \"I was certain it would be concealed somewhere about his person,\nand I have already given Benyon orders to search for it. Still, I confess\nthat for the moment your agitation misled me into believing these were\nthe important papers; and I admit, my dear creature, that unless you came\nhither prompted by a mad design somehow to destroy the incriminating\ndocuments and thereby to ensure your lover's life--why, otherwise, I\nrepeat, I am quite unable to divine your motive.\"\n\nShe was silent for a while. Presently, \"You told me this afternoon,\" she\nbegan, in a dull voice, \"that you anticipated much amusement from your\nperusal of Mr. Vanringham's correspondence. All his papers were to be\nseized, you said; and they all were to be brought to you, you said. And so\nmany love-sick misses write to actors, you said.\"\n\n\"As I recall the conversation,\" his Grace conceded, \"that which you have\nstated is quite true.\" He spoke with admirable languor, but his countenance\nwas vaguely troubled.\n\nAnd now the girl came to him and laid her finger-tips ever so lightly upon\nhis. \"Trust me,\" she pleaded. \"Give me again the trust I have not merited.\nAy, in spite of reason, my Lord Duke, restore to me these papers unread,\nthat I may destroy them. For otherwise, I swear to you that without gain\nto yourself--without gain, O God!--you wreck alike the happiness of an\ninnocent woman and of an honest gentleman. And otherwise--O infatuate!\" she\nwailed, and wrung impotent hands.\n\nBut Ormskirk shook his head. \"I cannot leap in the dark.\"\n\nShe found no comfort in his face, and presently lowered her eyes. He\nremained motionless. The girl went to the farther end of the apartment, and\nthen, her form straightening on a sudden, turned and came back toward him.\n\n\"I think God has some grudge against you,\" Dorothy said, without any\nemotion, \"and--hardens your heart, as of old He hardened Pharaoh's heart,\nto your own destruction. I have done my utmost to save you. My woman's\nmodesty I have put aside, and death and worse than death I have dared to\nencounter to-night,--ah, my Lord, I have walked through hell this night for\nyour sake and another's. And in the end 'tis yourself who rob me of what I\nhad so nearly gained. Beyond doubt God has some grudge against you. Take\nyour fate, then.\"\n\n\"_Integer vit\u00e6_--\" said the Duke of Ormskirk; and with more acerbity, \"Go\non!\" For momentarily she had paused.\n\n\"The man who lies dead below was loved by many women. God pity them! But\nwomen are not sensible like men, you know. And always the footlights made a\nhalo about him; and when you saw him as Castalio or Romeo, all beauty and\nlove and vigor and nobility, how was a woman to understand his splendor was\na sham, taken off with his wig, removed with his pinchbeck jewelry, and as\nfalse? No, they thought it native, poor wretches. Yet one of them at least,\nmy Lord--a young girl--found out her error before it was too late. The man\nwas a villain through and through. God grant he sups in hell to-night!\"\n\n\"Go on,\" said Ormskirk. But by this time he knew all that she had to tell.\n\n\"Afterward he demanded money of her. He had letters, you understand--mad,\nfoolish letters,--and these he offered to sell back to her at his own\nprice. And their publicity meant ruin. And, my Lord, we had so nearly saved\nthe money--pinching day by day, a little by a little, for his price was\nvery high, and it was necessary the sum be got in secrecy,--and that in the\nend they should be read by you--\" Her voice broke.\n\n\"Go on,\" said Ormskirk.\n\nBut her composure was shattered. \"I would have given my life to save her,\"\nthe girl babbled. \"Ah, you know that I have tried to save her. I was not\nvery much afraid. And it seemed the only way. So I came hither, my Lord, as\nyou see me, to get back the letters before you, too, had come.\"\n\n\"There is but one woman in the world,\" the Duke said, quietly, \"for whom\nyou would have done this thing. You and Marian were reared together. Always\nyou have been inseparable, always you have been to each other as sisters.\nIs this not what you are about to tell me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered.\n\n\"Well, you may spare yourself the pains of such unprofitable lying. That\nMarian Heleigh should have been guilty of a vulgar _liaison_ with, an actor\nis to me, who know her, unthinkable. No, madam! It was fear, not love,\nwhich drove you hither to-night, and now a baser terror urges you to screen\nyourself by vilifying her. The woman of whom you speak is yourself. The\nletters were written by you.\"\n\nShe raised one arm as though a physical blow impended. \"No, no!\" she cried.\n\n\"Madam,\" the Duke said, \"let us have done with these dexterities. I\nhave the vanity to believe I am not unreasonably obtuse--nor, I submit,\nunreasonably self-righteous. Love is a monstrous force, as irrational, I\nsometimes think, as the force of the thunderbolt; it appears neither to\nselect nor to eschew, but merely to strike; and it is not my duty to\nasperse or to commend its victims. You have loved unworthily. From the\nbottom of my heart I pity you, and I would that you had trusted me--had\ntrusted me enough--\" His voice was not quite steady. \"Ah, my dear,\" said\nOrmskirk, \"you should have confided all to me this afternoon. It hurts me\nthat you did not, for I am no Pharisee and--God knows!--my own past is not\nimmaculate. I would have understood, I think. Yet as it is, take back your\nletters, child,--nay, in Heaven's name, take them in pledge of an old man's\nlove for Dorothy Allonby.\"\n\nThe girl obeyed, turning them in her hands, the while that her eyes were\nriveted to Ormskirk's face. And in Aprilian fashion she began to smile\nthrough her tears. \"You are superb, my Lord Duke. You comprehend that\nMarian wrote these letters, and that if you read them--and I knew of\nit,--your pride would force you to break off the match, because your\nnotions as to what is befitting in a Duchess of Ormskirk are precise. But\nyou want Marian, you want her even more than I had feared. Therefore, you\ngive me all these letters, because you know that I will destroy them, and\nthus an inconvenient knowledge will be spared you. Oh, beyond doubt, you\nare superb.\"\n\n\"I give them to you,\" Ormskirk answered, \"because I have seen through your\ncowardly and clumsy lie, and have only pity for a thing so base as you. I\ngive them to you because to read one syllable of their contents would be to\nadmit I had some faith in your preposterous fabrication.\"\n\nBut she shook her head. \"Words, words, my Lord Duke! I understand you to\nthe marrow. And, in part, I think that I admire you.\"\n\nHe was angry now. \"Eh! for the love of God,\" cried the Duke of Ormskirk,\n\"let us burn the accursed things and have no more verbiage!\" He seized the\npapers and flung them into the fire.\n\nThen these two watched the papers consume to ashes, and stood a while\nin silence, the gaze of neither lifting higher than the andirons; and\npresently there was a tapping at the door.\n\n\"That will be Benyon,\" the Duke said, with careful modulations. \"Enter,\nman! What news is there of this Vanringham?\"\n\n\"He will recover, your Grace, though he has lost much blood. Mr. Vanringham\nhas regained consciousness and took occasion to whisper me your Grace would\nfind the needful papers in his escritoire, in the brown despatch-box.\"\n\n\"That is well,\" the Duke retorted, \"You may go, Benyon.\" And when the\ndoor had closed, he began, incuriously: \"Then you are not a murderess at\nleast, Miss Allonby. At least--\" He made a queer noise as he gazed, at the\ndespatch-box in his hand. \"The brown box!\" It fell to the floor. Ormskirk\ndrew near to her, staring, moving stiffly like a hinged toy, \"I must have\nthe truth,\" he said, without a trace of any human passion. This was the\nOrmskirk men had known in Scotland.\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered, \"they were the Jacobite papers. You burned them.\"\n\n\"I!\" said the Duke.\n\nPresently he said: \"Do you not understand what this farce has cost? Thanks\nto you, I have no iota of proof against these men. I cannot touch these\nrebels. O madam, I pray Heaven that you have not by this night's trickery\ndestroyed England!\"\n\n\"I did it to save the man I love,\" she proudly said.\n\n\"I had promised you his life.\"\n\n\"But would you have kept that promise?\"\n\n\"No,\" he answered, simply.\n\n\"Then are we quits, my Lord. You lied to me, and I to you. Oh, I know\nthat were I a man you would kill me within the moment. But you respect my\nwomanhood. Ah, goodness!\" the girl cried, shrilly, \"what very edifying\nrespect for womanhood have you, who burned those papers because you\nbelieved my dearest Marian had stooped to a painted mountebank!\"\n\n\"I burned them--yes, in the belief that I was saving you.\"\n\nShe laughed in his face. \"You never believed that,--not for an instant.\"\n\nBut by this time Ormskirk had regained his composure. \"The hour is somewhat\nlate, and the discussion--if you will pardon the suggestion,--not likely to\nbe profitable. The upshot of the whole matter is that I am now powerless to\nharm anybody--I submit the simile of the fangless snake,--and that Captain\nAudaine will have his release in the morning. Accordingly you will now\npermit me to wish you a pleasant night's rest. Benyon!\" he called, \"you\nwill escort Mr. Osric Allonby homeward. I remain to clear up this affair.\"\n\nHe held open the door for her, and, bowing, stood aside that she might\npass.\n\n\nVIII\n\nBut afterward the great Duke of Ormskirk continued for a long while\nmotionless and faintly smiling as he gazed into the fire. Tricked and\nignominiously defeated! Ay, but that was a trifle now, scarcely worthy of\nconsideration. The girl had hoodwinked him, had lied more skilfully than\nhe, yet in the fact that she had lied he found a prodigal atonement. Whigs\nand Jacobites might have their uses in the cosmic scheme, he reflected, as\nhouse-flies have, but what really mattered was that at Halvergate yonder\nMarian awaited his coming. And in place of statecraft he fell to thinking\nof two hazel eyes and of abundant hair the color of a dead oak-leaf.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nAPRIL'S MESSAGE\n\n\n_As Played at Halvergate House, April 9, 1750_\n\n    \"_You cannot love, nor pleasure take, nor give,\n  But life begin when 'tis too late to live.\n  On a tired courser you pursue delight,\n  Let slip your morning, and set out at night.\n  If you have lived, take thankfully the past;\n  Make, as you can, the sweet remembrance last.\n  If you have not enjoyed what youth could give,\n  But life sunk through you, like a leaky sieve._\"\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6\n\nDUKE OF ORMSKIKK.\n\nEARL OF BRUDENEL, father to Lady Marian Heleigh, who\nhas retired sometime into the country.\n\nLORD HUMPHREY DEGGE, a gamester, and Ormskirk's\nhireling.\n\nMR. LANGTON, secretary to Ormskirk.\n\nLADY MARIAN HELEIGH, betrothed to Ormskirk, a young,\nbeautiful girl of a mild and tender disposition.\n\n\nSCENE\n\nThe east terrace of Halvergate House.\n\n\n\n\nAPRIL'S MESSAGE\n\n\n_PROEM:--Apologia pro Auctore_\n\nIt occurs to me that we here assume intimacy with a man of unusual\nachievement, and therefore tread upon quaggy premises. Yet I do but avail\nmyself of to-day's privilege.... It is an odd thing that people will\nfacilely assent to Don Adriano's protestation against a certain travestying\nof Hector,--\"Sweet chucks, beat not the bones of the dead, for when he\nbreathed he was a man,\"--even while through the instant the tide of romance\nwill be setting quite otherwhither, with their condonation. For in all\nthe best approved romances the more sumptuous persons of antiquity are\nvery guilty of twaddle on at least one printed page in ten, and nobody\nremonstrates; and here is John Bulmer, too, lugged from the grave for your\ndelectation.\n\nI presume, however, to palliate the offence. The curious may find the gist\nof what I narrate concerning Ormskirk in Heinrich L\u00f6we's biography of the\nman, and will there discover that with established facts I have not made\nbold to juggle. Only when knowledge failed have I bridged the void with\nspeculation. Perhaps I have guessed wrongly: the feat is not unhuman, and\nin provision against detection therein I can only protest that this lack of\nomniscience was never due to malice; faithfully I have endeavored to deduce\nfrom the known the probable, and in nothing to misrepresent to you this big\nman of a little age, this trout among a school of minnows.\n\nTrout, mark you; I claim for Ormskirk no leviathan-ship. Rather I would\nremind you of a passage from somewhat anterior memoirs: \"The Emperor of\nLilliput is taller, by almost the breadth of my nail, than any of his\ncourt, which alone is enough to strike an awe into his beholders.\"\n\nThis, however, is not the place to expatiate on Ormskirk's extraordinary\ncareer; his rise from penury and obscurity, tempered indeed by gentle\nbirth, to the priviest secrets of his Majesty's council,--climbing\nthe peerage step by step, as though that institution had been a\ngarden-ladder,--may be read of in the history books.\n\n\"I collect titles as an entomologist does butterflies,\" he is recorded to\nhave said: \"and I find the gaudier ones the cheapest. My barony I got for\na very heinous piece of perjury, my earldom for not running away until the\nlatter end of a certain battle, my marquisate for hoodwinking a half-senile\nFrenchman, and my dukedom for fetching in a quack doctor when he was sore\nneeded by a lady whom the King at that time delighted to honor.\"\n\nIt was, you observe, a day of candors.\n\n\nI\n\nThe Duke of Ormskirk, then (one gleans from L\u00f6we's pages), dismissed from\nmind the Audaine conspiracy. It was a pity to miss the salutary effect of a\nfew political executions just then, but after all there was nothing to be\ndone about it. So the Duke turned to the one consolation offered by the\naffair, and set out for Halvergate House, the home of Marian Heleigh's\nfather. There one finds him, six days later, deep in a consultation with\nhis secretary, which in consideration of the unseasonable warmth was held\nupon the east terrace.\n\n\"Yes, I think we had better have the fellow hanged on the thirteenth,\" said\nOrmskirk, as he leisurely affixed his signature. \"The date seems eminently\nappropriate. Now the papers concerning the French treaty, if you please,\nMr. Langton.\"\n\nThe impassive-faced young man who sat opposite placed a despatch-box\nbetween them. \"These were sent down from London only last night, sir.\nMr. Morfit [Footnote: Perhaps the most adroit of all the many spies in\nOrmskirk's employment. It was this same Morfit who in 1756 accompanied\nDamiens into France as far as Calais; and see page 16.] has been somewhat\ndilatory.\"\n\n\"Eh, it scarcely matters. I looked them over in bed this morning and found\nthem quite correct, Mr. Langton, quite--Why, heyday!\" the Duke demanded,\n\"what's this? You have brought me the despatch-box from my dresser--not,\nas I distinctly told you, from the table by my bed. Nay, I have had quite\nenough of mistakes concerning despatch-boxes, Mr. Langton.\"\n\nMr. Langton stammered that the error was natural. Two despatch-boxes were\nin appearances so similar--\n\n\"Never make excuses, Mr. Langton. '_Qui s'excuse--_' You can complete the\nproverb, I suppose. Bring me Morfit's report this afternoon, then. Yes,\nthat appears to be all. You may go now, Mr. Langton. No, you may leave that\nbox, I think, since it is here. O man, man, a mistake isn't high treason!\nGo away, Mr. Langton! you annoy me.\"\n\nLeft alone, the Duke of Ormskirk sat for a while, tapping his fingers\nirresolutely against the open despatch-box. He frowned a little, for, with\nfair reason to believe Tom Langton his son, he found the boy too stolid,\ntoo unimaginative, to go far. It seemed to Ormskirk that none of his\nillegitimate children displayed any particular promise, and he sighed. Then\nhe took a paper from the despatch-box, and began to read.\n\nHe sat, as one had said, upon the east terrace of Halvergate House. Behind\nhim a tall yew-hedge shut off the sunlight from the table where he and\nTom Langton had earlier completed divers businesses; in front of him a\nbalustrade, ivy-covered, and set with flower-pots of stone, empty as yet,\nhalf screened the terraced gardens that sank to the artificial lake below.\n\nThe Duke could see only a vast expanse of sky and a stray bit of Halvergate\nprinting the horizon with turrets, all sober gray save where the two\nbig copper cupolas of the south fa\u00e7ade burned in the April sun; but by\nbending forward you glimpsed close-shaven lawns dotted with clipped trees\nand statues,--as though, he reflected, Glumdalclitch had left her toys\nscattered haphazard about a green blanket--and the white of the broad\nmarble stairway descending to the sunlit lake, and, at times, the flash\nof a swan's deliberate passage across the lake's surface. All white and\ngreen and blue the vista was, and of a monastic tranquillity, save for\nthe plashing of a fountain behind the yew-hedge and the grumblings of an\noccasional bee that lurched complainingly on some by-errand of the hive.\n\nPresently his Grace of Ormskirk replaced the papers in the despatch-box,\nand, leaning forward, sighed. \"_Non_ _sum qualis eram sub bon\u00e6 regno\nCynar\u00e6_,\" said his Grace of Ormskirk. He had a statesman-like partiality\nfor the fag-end of an alcaic.\n\nThen he lifted his head at the sound of a girl's voice. Somewhere rearward\nto the hedge the girl idly sang--an old song of Thomas Heywood's,--in a\nserene contralto, low-pitched and effortless, but very sweet. Smilingly the\nDuke beat time.\n\nSang the girl:\n\n  \"Pack clouds away, and welcome, day!\n  With night we banish sorrow:\n  Sweet air, blow soft; mount, lark, aloft,\n  To give my love good-morrow.\n  Wings from the wind to please her mind,\n  Notes from the lark I'll borrow:\n  Bird, prune thy wing; nightingale, sing,\n  To give my love good-morrow.\"\n\nAnd here the Duke chimed in with a sufficiently pleasing baritone:\n\n  \"To give my love good-morrow,\n  Notes from them all I'll borrow.\"\n\n\"O heavens!\" spoke the possessor of the contralto, \"I would have thought\nyou were far too busy sending people to gaol and arranging their execution,\nand so on, to have any time for music. I am going for a walk in the forest,\nJack.\" Considering for a moment, she added, \"You may come, too, if you\nlike.\"\n\nBut the concession was made so half-heartedly that in the instant the\nDuke of Ormskirk raised a dissenting hand. \"I would not annoy you for an\nemperor's ransom. Go in peace, my child.\"\n\nLady Marian Heleigh stood at an opening in the yew-hedge and regarded him\nfor a lengthy interval in silence. Slender, men called her, and women \"a\nbean pole.\" There was about her a great deal of the child and something of\nthe wood-nymph. She had abundant hair, the color of a dead oak-leaf, and\nher skin was clear, with a brown tinge. Her eyes puzzled you by being\nneither brown nor green consistently; no sooner had you convicted them of\nverdancy than they shifted to the hue of polished maple, and vice versa;\nbut they were too large for her face, which narrowed rather abruptly\nbeneath a broad, low forehead, and they flavored her aspect with the shrewd\ninnocence of a kitten. She was by ordinary grave; but, animated, her\ncountenance quickened with somewhat the glow of a brown diamond; then her\ngenerous eyes flashed and filmed like waters moving under starlight, then\nyou knew she was beautiful. All in all, you saw in Marian a woman designed\nto be petted, a Columbine rather than a Cleopatra; her lures would never\nshake the stability of a kingdom, but would inevitably gut its toy-shops;\nand her departure left you meditative less of high enterprises than of\nbuying something for her.\n\nNow Marian considered her betrothed, and seemed to come at last to a\nconclusion that skirted platitude. \"Jack, two people can be fond of each\nother without wanting to be together all the time. And I really am fond of\nyou, Jack.\"\n\n\"I would be a fool if I questioned the first statement,\" rejoined the Duke;\n\"and if I questioned the second, very miserable. Nevertheless, you go in\npursuit of strange gods, and I decline to follow.\"\n\nHer eyebrows interrogated him.\n\n\"You are going,\" the Duke continued, \"in pursuit of gods beside whom I\nesteem Zidonian Ashtoreth, and Chemosh, and Milcom, the abomination of\nthe Ammonites, to be commendable objects of worship. You will pardon my\npedantic display of learning, for my feelings are strong. You are going\nto sit in the woods. You will probably sit under a youngish tree, and its\nbranches will sway almost to the ground and make a green, sun-steeped tent\nabout you, as though you sat at the heart of an emerald. You will hear the\nkindly wood-gods go steathily about the forest, and you will know that they\nare watching you, but you will never see them. From behind every tree-bole\nthey will watch you; you feel it, but you never, never quite see them.\nPresently the sweet, warm odors of the place and its perpetual whispering\nand the illimitably idiotic boasting of the birds,--that any living\ncreature should be proud of having constructed one of their nasty little\nnests is a reflection to baffle understanding,--this hodge-podge of\nsensations, I say, will intoxicate you. Yes, it will thoroughly intoxicate\nyou, Marian, and you sit there quite still, in a sort of stupor, drugged\ninto the inebriate's magnanimity, firmly believing that the remainder of\nyour life will be throughout of finer texture,--earth-spurning, free from\nall pettiness, and at worst vexed only by the noblest sorrows. Bah!\" cried\nthe Duke; \"I have no patience with such nonsense! You will believe it to\nthe tiniest syllable, that wonderful lying message which April whispers to\nevery living creature that is young,--then you will return to me, a slim,\nstar-eyed M\u00e6nad, and will see that I am wrinkled. But do you go your ways,\nnone the less, for April is waiting for you yonder,--beautiful, mendacious,\nsplendid April. And I? Faith, April has no message for me, my dear.\"\n\nHe laughed, but with a touch of wistfulness; and the girl came to him,\nlaying her hand upon his arm, surprised into a sort of hesitant affection.\n\n\"How did you know, Jack? How did you, know that--things, invisible,\ngracious things, went about the spring woods? I never thought that you knew\nof them. You always seemed so sensible. I have reasoned it out, though,\"\nMarian went on, sagaciously wrinkled as to the brow. \"They are probably the\nheathen fauns and satyrs and such,--one feels somehow that they are all\nmen. Don't you, Jack? Well, when the elder gods were sent packing from\nOlympus there was naturally no employment left for these sylvan folk. So\nApril took them into her service. Each year she sends them about every\nforest on her errands: she sends them to make up daffodil-cups, for\ninstance, which I suppose is difficult, for evidently they make them out\nof sunshine; or to pencil the eyelids of the narcissi--narcissi are brazen\ncreatures, Jack, and use a deal of kohl; or to marshal the fleecy young\nclouds about the sky; or to whistle the birds up from the south. Oh, she\nkeeps them busy, does April! And 'tis true that if you be quite still you\ncan hear them tripping among the dead leaves; and they watch you--with\nvery bright, twinkling little eyes, I think,--but you never see them.\nAnd always, always there is that enormous whispering,--half-friendly,\nhalf-menacing,--as if the woods were trying to tell you something. 'Tis\nnot only the foliage rustling.... No, I have often thought it sounded like\nsome gigantic foreigner--some Titan probably,--trying in his own queer\nand outlandish language to tell you something very important, something\nthat means a deal to you, and to you in particular. Has not anybody ever\nunderstood him?\"\n\nHe smiled. \"And I, too, have dwelt in Arcadia,\" said his Grace of Ormskirk.\n\"Yes, I once heard April's message, Marian, for all my crow's-feet. But\nthat was a long while ago, and perhaps I have forgotten it. I cannot tell,\nmy dear. It is only from April in her own person that one hears this\nimmemorial message. And as for me? Eh, I go into the April woods, and I\nfind trees there of various sizes that pay no attention to me, and shrill,\ndingy little birds that deafen me, and it may be a gaudy flower or two,\nand, in any event, I find a vast quantity of sodden, decaying leaves to\nwarn me the place is no fitting haunt for a gentleman afflicted with\nrheumatism. So I come away, my dear.\"\n\nMarian looked him over for a moment. \"You are not really old,\" she said,\nwith rather conscious politeness. \"And you are wonderfully well-preserved.\nWhy, Jack, do you mind--not being foolish?\" she demanded, on a sudden.\n\nHe debated the matter. Then, \"Yes,\" the Duke of Ormskirk conceded, \"I\nsuppose I do, at the bottom of my heart, regret that lost folly. A part\nof me died, you understand, when it vanished, and it is not exhilarating\nto think of one's self as even partially dead. Once--I hardly know\"--he\nsought the phrase,--\"once this was a spacious and inexplicable world, with\na mystery up every lane and an adventure around each street-corner; a\nworld inhabited by most marvelous men and women,--some amiable, and some\ndetestable, but every one of them very interesting. And now I miss the\nwonder of it all. You will presently discover, my dear, that youth is only\nan ingenious prologue to whet one's appetite for a rather dull play. Eh, I\nam no pessimist,--one may still find satisfaction in the exercise of mind\nand body, in the pleasures of thought and taste and in other titillations\nof one's faculties. Dinner is good and sleep, too, is excellent. But we men\nand women tend, upon too close inspection, to appear rather paltry flies\nthat buzz and bustle aimlessly about, and breed perhaps, and eventually\ndie, and rot, and are swept away from this fragile window-pane of time that\nopens on eternity.\"\n\n\"If you are, indeed, the sort of person you describe,\" said Marian,\nreflectively, \"I do not at all blame April for having no communication with\nanyone possessed of such extremely unpleasant opinions. But for my own\npart, I shall never cease to wonder what it is that the woods whisper\nabout.\"\n\nAppraising her, he hazarded a cryptic question, \"Vase of delights, and have\nyou never--cared?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, I think so,\" she answered, readily enough. \"At least, I used\nto be very fond of Humphrey Degge,--that is the Marquis of Venour's place\nyonder, you know, just past the spur of the forest,--but he was only a\nyounger son, so of course Father wouldn't hear of it. That was rather\nfortunate, as Humphrey by and by went mad about Dorothy's blue eyes and\nfine shape,--I think her money had a deal to do with it, too, and in any\nevent, she will be fat as a pig at thirty,--and so we quarrelled. And I\nminded it--at first. And now--well, I scarcely know.\" Marian hesitated. \"He\nwas a handsome man, but that ridiculous cavalry moustache of his was so\nbristly--\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\" said the Duke.\n\n\"--that it disfigured him dreadfully,\" said she, with firmness. She had\ncolored.\n\nHis Grace of Ormskirk was moved to mirth. \"Child, child, you are so\ndeliciously young it appears a monstrous crime to marry you to an old\nfellow like me!\" He took her firm, soft hand in his. \"Are you quite sure\nyou can endure me, Marian?\"\n\n\"Why, but of course I want to marry you,\" she said, na\u00efvely surprised. \"How\nelse could I be Duchess of Ormskirk?\"\n\nAgain he chuckled. \"You are a worldly little wretch,\" he stated; \"but if\nyou want my title for a new toy, it is at your service. And now be off with\nyou,--you and your foolish woods, indeed!\"\n\nMarian went a slight distance and then turned about, troubled. \"I am really\nvery fond of you, Jack,\" she said, conscientiously.\n\n\"Be off with you!\" the Duke scolded. \"You should be ashamed of yourself to\npractice such flatteries and blandishments on a defenceless old gentleman.\nYou had best hurry, too, for if you don't I shall probably kiss you,\" he\nthreatened. \"I, also,\" he added, with point.\n\nShe blew him a kiss from her finger-tips and went away singing.\n\nSang Marian:\n\n    \"Blackbird and thrush, in every bush,\n  Stare, linnet, and cock-sparrow,\n  You pretty elves, amongst yourselves,\n  Sing my fair love good-morrow.\n  To give my love good-morrow,\n  Sing birds, in every furrow.\"\n\n\nII\n\nLeft to his own resources, the Duke of Ormskirk sat down beside the table\nand fell to making irrelevant marks upon a bit of paper. He hummed the air\nof Marian's song. There was a vague contention in his face. Once he put\nout his hand toward the open despatch-box, but immediately he sighed and\npushed, it farther from him. Presently he propped his chin upon both hands\nand stayed in the attitude for a long while, staring past the balustrade at\nthe clear, pale sky of April.\n\nThus Marian's father, the Earl of Brudenel, found Ormskirk. The Earl\nwas lean and gray, though only three years older than his prospective\nson-in-law, and had been Ormskirk's intimate since boyhood. Ormskirk had\nfor Lord Brudenel's society the liking that a successful person usually\npreserves for posturing in the gaze of his outrivalled school-fellows:\nBrudenel was an embodied and flattering commentary as to what a less able\nman might make of chances far more auspicious than Ormskirk ever enjoyed.\nAll failure the Earl's life had been; in London they had long ago forgotten\nhandsome Harry Heleigh and the composure with which he nightly shoved his\ndwindling patrimony across the gaming-table; about Halvergate men called\nhim \"the muddled Earl,\" and said of him that his heart died, with his young\nwife some eighteen years back. Now he vegetated in the home of his fathers,\ncontentedly, a veteran of life, retaining still a mild pride in his past\nvagaries; [Footnote: It was then well said of him by Claridge, \"It is\nLord Henry Heleigh's vanity to show that he is a man of pleasure as well\nas of business; and thus, in settlement, the expedition he displays\ntoward a fellow-gambler is equitably balanced by his tardiness toward\na too-credulous shoemaker.\"] and kindly time had armed him with the\nbenumbing, impenetrable indifference of the confessed failure. He was\nabstractedly courteous to servants, and he would not, you felt, have given\neven to an emperor his undivided attention. For the rest, the former\nwastrel had turned miser, and went noticeably shabby as a rule, but this\nmorning he was trimly clothed, for he was returning homeward from the\nquarter-sessions at Winstead.\n\n\"Dreamer!\" said the Earl. \"I do not wonder that you grow fat.\"\n\nThe Duke smiled up at him. \"Confound you, Harry!\" said he, \"I had just\noverreached myself into believing I had made what the world calls a mess\nof my career and was supremely happy. There are disturbing influences\nabroad to-day.\" He waved his hand toward the green-and-white gardens. \"Old\nfriend, you permit disreputable trespassers about Halvergate. 'See you not\nGoldy-locks there, in her yellow gown and green sleeves? the profane pipes,\nthe tinkling timbrels?' Spring is at her wiles yonder,--Spring, the liar,\nthe queen-cheat, Spring that tricks all men into happiness.\"\n\n\"'Fore Gad,\" the Earl capped his quotation, \"if the heathen man could stop\nhis ears with wax against the singing woman of the sea, then do you the\nlike with your fingers against the trollop of the forest.\"\n\n\"Faith, time seals them firmlier than wax. You and I may sit snug now with\nnever a quicker heart-beat for all her lures. Yet I seem to remember,--once\na long while ago when we old fellows were somewhat sprier,--I, too, seem to\nremember this Spring-magic.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" observed the Earl, seating himself ponderously, \"if you refer to\na certain inclination at that period of the year toward the likeliest wench\nin the neighborhood, so do I. 'Tis an obvious provision of nature, I take\nit, to secure the perpetuation of the species. Spring comes, and she sets\nus all a-mating--humanity, partridges, poultry, pigs, every blessed one of\nus she sets a-mating. Propagation, Jack--propagation is necessary, d'ye\nsee; because,\" the Earl conclusively demanded, \"what on earth would become\nof us if we didn't propagate?\"\n\n\"The argument is unanswerable,\" the Duke conceded. \"Yet I miss it,--this\nSpring magic that no longer sets the blood of us staid fellows a-fret.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said Lord Brudenel, \"do not. It got me into the deuce of a scrape\nmore than once.\"\n\n\"Yours is the sensible view, no doubt....Yet I miss it. Ah, it is not only\nthe wenches and the red lips of old years,--it is not only that at this\nseason lasses' hearts grow tender. There are some verses--\" The Duke\nquoted, with a half-guilty air:\n\n  \"Now I loiter, and dream to the branches swaying\n  In furtive conference,--high overhead--\n  Atingle with rumors that Winter is sped\n  And over his ruins a world goes Maying.\n\n  \"Somewhere--impressively,--people are saying\n  Intelligent things (which their grandmothers said),\n  While I loiter, and dream to the branches swaying\n  In furtive conference, high overhead.\"\n\n\"Verses!\" The Earl snorted. \"At your age!\"\n\n  \"Here the hand of April, unwashed from slaying\n  Earth's fallen tyrant--for Winter is dead,--\n  Uncloses anemones, staining them red:\n  And her daffodils guard me in squads,--displaying\n  Intrepid lances lest wisdom tread\n  Where I loiter and dream to the branches' swaying--\n\n\"Well, Harry, and to-day I cannot do so any longer. That is what I most\nmiss,--the ability to lie a-sprawl in the spring grass and dream out an\nuncharted world,--a dream so vivid that, beside it, reality grew tenuous,\nand the actual world became one of childhood's shrug-provoking bugbears\ndimly remembered.\"\n\n\"I do not understand poetry,\" the Earl apologetically observed. \"It appears\nto me unreasonable to advance a statement simply because it happens to\nrhyme with a statement you have previously made. And that is what all\nyou poets do. Why, this is very remarkable,\" said Lord Brudenel, with a\nchange of tone; \"yonder is young Humphrey Degge with Marian. I had thought\nhim in bed at Tunbridge. Did I not hear something of an affair with a\nhouse-breaker--?\"\n\nThen the Earl gave an exclamation, for in full view of them Lord Humphrey\nDegge was kissing Lord Brudenel's daughter.\n\n\"Oh, the devil!\" said the Earl. \"Oh, the insolent young ape!\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the Duke, restraining him; \"not particularly insolent, Harry.\nIf you will observe more closely you will see that Marian does not exactly\nobject to his caresses--quite the contrary, I would say, I told you that\nyou should not permit Spring about the premises.\"\n\nThe Earl wheeled in an extreme of astonishment. \"Come, come, sir! she is\nyour betrothed wife! Do you not intend to kill the fellow?\"\n\n\"My faith, why?\" said his Grace of Ormskirk, with a shrug. \"As for\nbetrothals, do you not see that she is already very happily paired?\"\n\nIn answer Brudenel raised his hands toward heaven, in just the contention\nof despair and rage appropriate to parental affection when an excellent\nmatch is imperilled by a chit's idiocy.\n\nMarian and Lord Humphrey Degge were mounting from the scrap of forest that\njuts from Pevis Hill, like a spur from a man's heel, between Agard Court\nand Halvergate. Their progress was not conspicuous for celerity. Now they\nhad attained to the tiny, elm-shadowed plateau beyond the yew-hedge,\nand there Marian paused. Two daffodils had fallen from the great\ngreen-and-yellow cluster in her left hand. Humphrey Degge lifted them,\nand then raised to his mouth the slender fingers that reached toward the\nflowers. The man's pallor, you would have said, was not altogether due to\nhis recent wound.\n\nShe stood looking up at him, smiling a little timidly, her teeth glinting\nthrough parted lips, her eyes star-fire, her cheeks blazoning gules in his\nhonor; she seemed not to breathe at all. A faint twinge woke in the Duke\nof Ormskirk's heart. Most women smiled upon him, but they smiled beneath\nfurtive eyes, sometimes beneath rapacious eyes, and many smiled with\nreddened lips which strove, uneasily, to provoke a rental; how long was it\nhe wondered, simply, since any woman had smiled as Marian smiled now, for\nhim?\n\n\"I think it is a dream,\" said Marian.\n\nFrom the vantage of the yew-hedge, \"I would to Heaven I could think so,\ntoo,\" observed her father.\n\n\nIII\n\nThe younger people had passed out of sight. But from the rear of the hedge\ncame to the Duke and Lord Brudenel, staring blankly at each other across\nthe paper-littered table, a sort of duet. First tenor, then contralto, then\ntenor again,--and so on, with many long intervals of silence, during which\nyou heard the plashing of the fountain, grown doubly audible, and, it might\nbe, the sharp, plaintive cry of a bird intensified by the stillness.\n\n\"I think it is a dream,\" said Marian....\n\n\"What eyes you have, Marian!\"\n\n\"But you have not kissed the littlest finger of all. See, it is quite stiff\nwith indignation.\"\n\n\"They are green, and brown, and yellow--O Marian, there are little gold\nspecks in them like those in _eau de Dantzig_! They are quite wonderful\neyes, Marian. And your hair is all streaky gold-and-brown. You should not\nhave two colors in your hair, Marian. Marian, did any one ever tell you\nthat you are very beautiful?\"\n\nSilence. \"Pee-weet!\" said a bird. \"Tweet?\"\n\nAnd Marian replied: \"I am devoted to Dorothy, of course, but I have never\nadmired her fashion of making advances to every man she meets. Yes, she\ndoes.\"\n\n\"Nay, 'twas only her money that lured me, to do her justice. It appeared so\nvery sensible to marry an heiress.... But how can any man be sensible so\nlong as he is haunted by the memory of your eyes? For see how bright they\nare,--see, here in the water. Two stars have fallen into the fountain,\nMarian.\"\n\n\"You are handsomer so. Your nose is too short, but here in the fountain you\nare quite handsome--\"\n\n\"Marian,--\"\n\n\"I wonder how many other women's fingers you have kissed--like that. Ah,\ndon't tell me, Humphrey! Humphrey, promise me that you will always lie to\nme when I ask you about those other women. Lie to me, my dear, and I will\nknow that you are lying and love you all the better for it.... You should\nnot have told me about Dorothy. How often did you kiss all of Dorothy's\nfinger-tips one by one, in just that foolish, dear way?\"\n\n\"But who was this Dorothy you speak of, Marian? I have forgotten. Oh,\nyes--we quarrelled--over some woman,--and I went away. I left you for a\nmere heiress, Marian. You! And five days, ago while I lay abed, wounded,\nthey told me that you, were to marry Ormskirk. I thought I would go mad....\nEh, I remember now. But what do these things matter? Is it not of far\ngreater importance that the sunlight turns your hair to pure topaz?\"\n\n\"Ah, my hair, my eyes! Is it these you care for? You would not love me,\nthen, if I were old and ugly?\"\n\n\"Eh,--I love you.\"\n\n\"Animal!\"\n\nThere was a longer silence now. \"Tweet!\" said a bird, pertly.\n\nThen Marian said, \"Let us go to my father.\"\n\n\"To tell him--?\"\n\n\"Why, that I love you, I suppose, and that I cannot marry Jack, not even\nto be a duchess. Oh, I did so much want to be a duchess! But when you came\nback to me yonder in the forest, somehow I stopped wanting anything more.\nSomething--I hardly know--something seemed to say, as you came striding\nthrough the dead leaves, laughing and so very pale,--something seemed to\nsay, 'You love him'--oh, quite audibly.\"\n\n\"Audibly! Why, the woods whispered it, the birds trilled it, screamed\nit, the very leaves underfoot crackled assent. Only they said, 'You love\nher--the girl yonder with glad, frightened eyes, Spring's daughter.' Oh, I\ntoo, heard it, Marian! 'Follow,' the birds sang, 'follow, follow, follow,\nfor yonder is the heart's desire!\"\n\nThe Duke of Ormskirk raised his head, his lips sketching a whistle. \"Ah!\nah!\" he muttered. \"Eureka! I have recaptured it--the message of April.\"\n\n\nIV\n\nWhen these two had gone the Duke flung out his hands in a comprehensive\ngesture of giving up the entire matter. \"Well,\" said he, \"you see how it\nis!\"\n\n\"I do,\" Lord Brudenel assented. \"And if you intend to sit patient under it,\nI, at least, wear a sword. Confound it, Jack, do you suppose I am going\nto have promiscuous young men dropping out of the skies and embracing my\ndaughter?\" The Earl became forceful in his language.\n\n\"Harry,--\" the Duke began.\n\n\"The fellow hasn't a penny--not a stick or a stiver to his name! He's only\na rascally, impudent younger son--and even Venour has nothing except Agard\nCourt yonder! That--that crow's nest!\" Lord Brudenel spluttered. \"They\nmooned about together a great deal a year ago, but I thought nothing of\nit; then he went away, and she never spoke of him again. Never spoke of\nhim--oh, the jade!\"\n\nThe Duke of Ormskirk considered the affair, a mild amusement waking in his\nplump face.\n\n\"Old friend,\" said he, at length, \"it is my opinion that we are perilously\nnear to being a couple of fools. We planned this marriage, you and I--dear,\ndear, we planned it when Marian was scarcely out of her cradle! But we\nfailed to take nature into the plot, Harry. It was sensible--Oh, granted!\nI obtained a suitable mistress for Ingilby and Bottreaux Towers, a\nmagnificent ornament for my coach and my opera-box; while you--your pardon,\nold friend, if I word it somewhat grossly,--you, in effect, obtained a\nwealthy and not uninfluential husband for your daughter. Nay, I think you\nare fond of me, but that is beside the mark; it was not Jack Bulmer who was\nto marry your daughter, but the Duke of Ormskirk. The thing was as logical\nas a sale of bullocks,--value for value. But now nature intervenes,\nand\"--he snapped his fingers,--\"eh, well, since she wants this Humphrey\nDegge, of course she must have him.\"\n\nLord Brudenel mentioned several penalties which he would voluntarily incur\nin case of any such preposterous marriage.\n\n\"Your style,\" the Duke regretfully observed, \"is somewhat more original\nthan your subject. You have a handsome daughter to barter, and you want\nyour price. The thing is far from uncommon. Yet you shall have your price,\nHarry. What estate do you demand of your son-in-law?\"\n\n\"What the devil are you driving at?\" said Lord Brudenel.\n\nComposedly the Duke of Ormskirk spread out his hands. \"You have, in effect,\nplaced Marian in the market,\" he said, \"and I offer to give Lord Humphrey\nDegge the money with which to purchase her.\"\n\n\"Tis evident,\" the Earl considered, \"that you are demented!\"\n\n\"Because I willingly part with money? But then I have a great deal of\nmoney. I have money, and I have power, and the King occasionally pats me\nupon the shoulder, and men call me 'your Grace,' instead of 'my Lord,' as\nthey do you. So I ought to be very happy, ought I not, Harry? Ah, yes,\nI ought to be entirely happy, because I have had everything, with the\nunimportant exception of the one thing I wanted.\"\n\nBut Lord Brudenel had drawn himself erect, stiffly. \"I am to understand,\nthen, from this farrago, that on account of the--um--a--incident we have\njust witnessed you decline to marry my daughter?\"\n\n\"I would sooner cut off my right hand,\" said the Duke, \"for I am fonder of\nMarian than I am of any other living creature.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well!\" the Earl conceded, sulkily. \"Umfraville wants her. He is\nonly a marquis, of course, but so far as money is concerned, I believe\nhe is a thought better off than you. I would have preferred you as a\nson-in-law, you understand, but since you withdraw--why, then, let it be\nUmfraville.\"\n\nNow the Duke looked up into his face for some while. \"You would do that!\nYou would sell Marian to Umfraville--[Footnote: \"Whose entrance blushing\nSatan did deny Lest hell be thought no better than a sty.\"] to a person who\nunites the continence of a partridge with the graces of a Berkshire hog--to\nthat lean whoremonger, to that disease-rotted goat! Because he has the\nmoney! Why, Harry, what a car you are!\"\n\nLord Brudenel bowed, \"My Lord Duke, you are to-day my guest. I apprehend\nyou will presently be leaving Halvergate, however, and as soon--as that\nregrettable event takes place, I shall see to it a friend wait upon you\nwith the length of my sword. Meanwhile I venture to reserve the privilege\nof managing my family affairs at my own discretion.\"\n\n\"I do not fight with hucksters,\" the Duke flung at him, \"and you are one.\nOh, you peddler! Can you not understand that I am trying to buy your\ndaughter's happiness?\"\n\n\"I intend that my daughter shall make a suitable match,\" replied the Earl,\nstubbornly, \"and she shall. If Marian is a sensible girl--and, barring\nto-day, I have always esteemed her such,--she will find happiness in\nobeying her father's mandates: otherwise--\" He waved the improbable\ncontingency aside.\n\n\"Sensible! Faith, can you not see, even now, that to be sensible is not the\nhighest wisdom? You and I are sensible as the world goes,--and in God's\nname, what good does it do us? Here we sit, two miserable and empty-veined\nold men squabbling across a deal-table, breaking up a friendship of\nthirty years. And yonder Marian and this Humphrey Degge--who are\nwithin a measurable distance of insanity, if their conversation be the\ntouchstone,--yet tread the pinnacles of some seventh heaven of happiness.\nApril has brought them love, Harry. Oh, I concede their love is folly! But\nit is all folly, Harry Heleigh. Purses, titles, blue ribbons, and the envy\nof our fellows are the toys which we struggle for, we sensible men; and in\nthe end we find them only toys, and, gaining them, we gain only weariness.\nAnd love, too, is a toy; but, gaining love, we gain, at least, a temporary\nhappiness. There is the difference, Harry Heleigh.\"\n\n\"Oh, have done with your, balderdash!\" said Lord Brudenel. He spoke\nirritably, for he knew his position to be guaranteed by common-sense, and\nhis slow wrath was kindling at opposition.\n\nHis Grace of Ormskirk rose to his feet, all tension. In the act his hand\nstruck against the open despatch-box; afterward, with a swift alteration\nof countenance, he overturned this box and scattered the contents about\nthe table. For a moment he seemed to forget Lord Brudenel; quite without\nwarning Ormskirk flared into rage.\n\n\"Harry Heleigh, Harry Heleigh!\" he cried, as he strode across the terrace,\nand caught Lord Brudenel roughly by the shoulder, \"are you not content to\ngo to your grave without killing another woman? Oh, you dotard miser!--you\nhaberdasher!--haven't I offered you money, an isn't money the only thing\nyou are now capable of caring for? Give the girl to Degge, you huckster!\"\n\nLord Brudenel broke from the Duke's grasp. Brudenel was asplutter with\nanger. \"I will see you damned first. You offer money,--I fling the money\nin your fat face. Look you, you have just insulted, me, and now you\noffer--money! Another insult. John Bulmer, I would not accept an affront\nlike this from an archangel. You are my guest, but I am only flesh and\nblood. I swear to you this is the most deliberate act of my life.\" Lord\nBrudenel struck him full upon the cheek.\n\n\"Pardon,\" said the Duke of Ormskirk. He stood rigid, his arms held stiff at\nhis sides, his hands clenched; the red mark showed plain against an ashy\ncountenance. \"Pardon me for a moment.\" Once or twice he opened and shut his\neyes like an automaton. \"And stop behaving so ridiculously. I cannot fight\nyou. I have other matters to attend to. We are wise, Harry,--you and I.\nWe know that love sometimes does not endure; sometimes it flares up\nat a girl's glance, quite suddenly, and afterward smoulders out into\nindifference or even into hatred. So, say we, let all sensible people marry\nfor money, for then in any event you get what you marry for,--a material\nbenefit, a tangible good, which does no vanish when the first squabble, or\nperhaps the first gray hair, arrives. That is sensible; but women, Harry,\nare not always sensible--\"\n\n\"Draw, you coward!\" Lord Brudenel snarled at him. The Earl had already\nlugged out his ineffectual dress sword, and would have been, as he stood on\nguard, a ludicrous figure had he not been rather terrible. His rage shook\nhim visibly, and his obstinate mouth twitched and snapped like that of a\nbeast cornered. All gray he was, and the sun glistened on his gray tye-wig\nas he waited. His eyes were coals.\n\nBut Ormskirk had regained composure. \"You know that I am not a coward,\" the\nDuke said, equably. \"I have proven it many times. Besides, you overlook two\ndetails. One is that I have no sword with me, I am quite unarmed. The other\ndetail is that only gentlemen fight duels, and just now we are hucksters,\nyou and I, chaffering over Marian's happiness. So I return to my\nbargaining. You will not sell Marian's happiness to me for money? Why,\nthen--remember, we are only hucksters, you and I,--I will purchase it by a\ndishonorable action. I will show you a woman's letters,--some letters I was\ngoing to burn romantically before I married--Instead, I wish you to read\nthem.\"\n\nHe pushed the papers lying upon the table toward Lord Brudenel. Afterward\nOrmskirk turned away and stood looking over the ivy-covered balustrade into\nthe gardens below. All white and green and blue the vista was, and of a\nmonastic tranquillity, save for the plashing of the fountain behind the\nyew-hedge. From the gardens at his feet irresolute gusts brought tepid\nwoodland odors. He heard the rustling of papers, heard Lord Brudenel's\nsword fall jangling to the ground. The Duke turned.\n\n\"And for twenty years I have been eating my heart out with longing for\nher,\" the Earl said. \"And--and I thought you were my friend, Jack.\"\n\n\"She was not your wife when I first knew her. But John Bulmer was a\npenniless nobody,--so they gave her to you, an earl's heir, those sensible\nparents of hers. I never saw her again, though--as you see,--she wrote to\nme sometimes. And her parents did the sensible thing; but I think they\nkilled her, Harry.\"\n\n\"Killed her?\" Lord Brudenel echoed, stupidly. Then on a sudden it was\nsingular to see the glare in his eyes puffed out like a candle. \"I killed\nher,\" he whispered; \"why, I killed Alison,--I!\" He began to laugh. \"Now\nthat is amusing, because she was the one thing in the world I ever loved.\nI remember that she used to shudder when I kissed her. I thought it was\nbecause she was only a brown and thin and timid child, who would be wiser\nin love's tricks by and by. Now I comprehend 'twas because every kiss was\ntorment to her, because every time I touched her 'twas torment. So she\ndied very slowly, did Alison,--and always I was at hand with my kisses, my\npet names, and my paddlings,--killing her, you observe, always urging her\ngraveward. Yes, and yet there is nothing in these letters to show how much\nshe must have loathed me!\" he said, in a mild sort of wonder. He appeared\nsenile now, the shrunken and calamitous shell of the man he had been within\nthe moment.\n\nThe Duke of Ormskirk put an arm about him. \"Old friend, old friend!\" said\nhe.\n\n\"Why did you not tell me?\" the Earl said. \"I loved you, Jack. I worshipped\nher. I would never willingly have seen you two unhappy.\"\n\n\"Her parents would have done as you planned to do,--they would have given\ntheir daughter to the next richest suitor. I was nobody then. So the wisdom\nof the aged slew us, Harry,--slew Alison utterly, and left me with a living\nbody, indeed, but with little more. I do not say that body has not amused\nitself. Yet I too, loved her, Harry Heleigh. And when I saw this new\nAlison--for Marian is her mother, face, heart, and soul,--why, some wraith\nof emotion stirred in me, some thrill, some not quite forgotten pulse. It\nseemed Alison come back from the grave. Love did not reawaken, for youth's\nfervor was gone out of me, yet presently I fell a-dreaming over my Madeira\non long winter evenings,--sedate and tranquil dreams of this new Alison\nflitting about Ingilby, making the splendid, desolate place into a home. Am\nold man's fancies, Harry,--fancies bred of my loneliness, for I am lonely\nnowadays. But my dreams, I find, were not sufficiently comprehensive; for\nthey did not anticipate April,--and nature,--and Lord Humphrey Degge. We\nmust yield to that triumvirate, we sensible old men. Nay, we are wise as\nthe world goes, but we have learned, you and I, that to be sensible is not\nthe highest wisdom. Marian is her mother in soul, heart, and feature. Don't\nlet the old tragedy be repeated, Harry. Let her have this Degge! Let Marian\nhave her chance of being happy, for a year or two....\"\n\nBut Lord Brudenel had paid very little attention. \"I suppose so,\" he said,\nwhen the Duke had ended. \"Oh, I suppose so. Jack, she was always kind and\npatient and gentle, you understand, but she used to shudder when I kissed\nher,\" he repeated, dully,--\"shudder, Jack.\" He sat staring at his sword\nlying there on the ground, as though it fascinated him.\n\n\"Ah, but,--old friend,\" the Duke cried, with his hand upon Lord Brudenel's\nshoulder, \"forgive me! It was the only way.\"\n\nLord Brudenel rose to his feet. \"Oh, yes! why, yes, I forgive you, if that\nis any particular comfort to you. It scarcely seems of any importance,\nthough. The one thing which really matters is that I loved her, and I\nkilled her. Oh, beyond doubt, I forgive you. But now that you have made my\nwhole past a hideous stench to me, and have proven the love I was so proud\nof--the one quite clean, quite unselfish thing in my life, I thought it,\nJack,--to have been only my lust vented on a defenceless woman,--why, just\nnow, I have not time to think of forgiveness. Yes, Marian may marry Degge\nif she cares to. And I am sorry I took her mother away from you. I would\nnot have done it if I had known.\"\n\nBrudenel started away drearily, but when he had gone a little distance\nturned back.\n\n\"And the point of it is,\" he said, with a smile, \"that I shall go on living\njust as if nothing had happened, and shall probably live for a long, long\ntime. My body is so confoundedly healthy. How the deuce did you have the\ncourage to go on living?\" he demanded, enviously. \"You loved her and you\nlost her. I'd have thought you would have killed yourself long ago.\"\n\nThe Duke shrugged. \"Yes, people do that in books. In books they have such\nstrong emotions--\"\n\nThen Ormskirk paused for a heart-beat, looking down into the gardens.\nWonderfully virginal it all seemed to Ormskirk, that small portion of\na world upon the brink of renaissance: a tessellation of clean colors,\nwhere the gravelled walkways were snow beneath the sun, and were in shadow\ntransmuted to dim violet tints; and for the rest, green ranging from the\nsober foliage of yew and box and ilex to the pale glow of young grass\nIn the full sunlight; all green, save where the lake shone, a sapphire\ngreen-girdled. Spring triumphed with a vaunting pageant. And in the\nforest, in the air, even in the unplumbed sea-depths, woke the mating\nimpulse,--irresistible, borne as it might seem on the slow-rising tide\nof grass that now rippled about the world. Everywhere they were mating;\neverywhere glances allured and mouth met mouth, while John Bulmer went\nalone without any mate or intimacy with anyone.\n\nEverywhere people were having emotions which Ormskirk envied. He had so few\nemotions nowadays. Even all this posturing and talk about Alison Heleigh in\nwhich he had just indulged began to savor somehow of play-acting. He had\nloved Alison, of course, and that which he had said was true enough--in\na way,--but, after all, he had over-colored it. There had been in his\nlife so many interesting matters, and so many other women too, that the\nloss of Alison could not be said to have blighted his existence quite\nsatisfactorily. No, John Bulmer had again been playing at the big emotions\nwhich he heard about and coveted, just as at this very moment John Bulmer\nwas playing at being sophisticated and _blas\u00e9_... with only poor old Harry\nfor audience....\n\n\"A great deal of me did die,\" the Duke heard this John Bulmer\nsaying,--\"all, I suppose, except my carcass, Harry. And it seemed hardly\nworth the trouble to butcher that also.\"\n\n\"No,\" Lord Brudenel conceded, \"I suppose not. I wonder, d'ye know, will\nanything ever again seem really worth the trouble of doing it?\"\n\nThe Duke of Ormskirk took his arm. \"Fy, Harry, bid the daws seek their food\nelsewhere, for a gentleman may not wear his heart upon his sleeve. Empires\ncrumble, and hearts break, and we are blessed or damned, as Fate elects;\nbut through it all we find comfort in the reflection that dinner is good,\nand sleep, too, is excellent. As for the future--eh, well, if it mean\nlittle to us, it means a deal to Alison's daughter. Let us go to them,\nHarry.\"\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nIN THE SECOND APRIL\n\n\n_As Played at Bellegarde, in the April of 1750_\n\n\"_This passion is in honest minds the strongest incentive that can move the\nsoul of man to laudable accomplishments. Is a man just? Let him fall in\nlove and grow generous. It immediately makes the good which is in him shine\nforth in new excellencies, and the ill vanish away without the pain of\ncontrition, but with a sudden amendment of heart._\"\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6\n\nDUKE OF ORMSKISK.\n\nDUC DE PUYSANGE, a true Frenchman, a pert, railing fribble, but at bottom a\nman of parts.\n\nMARQUIS DE SOYECOURT, a brisk, conceited rake, and distant cousin to de\nPuysange.\n\nCAZAIO, captain of brigands.\n\nDOM MICHEL FR\u00c9GOSE, a lewd, rascally friar.\n\nGUITON, steward to de Puysange.\n\nPAWSEY, Ormskirk's man.\n\nACHON, a knave.\n\nMICHAULT, another knave.\n\nDUCHESSE DE PUYSANGE.\n\nCLAIRE, sister to de Puysange, a woman of beauty and resolution, of a\nliteral humor.\n\nATTENDANTS, BRIGANDS, and DRAGOONS; and, in the Proem, LORD HUMPHREY DEGGE\nand LADY MARIAN HELEIGH.\n\n\nSCENE\n\nFirst at Dover, thence shifting to Bellegarde-en-Poictesme and the adjacent\ncountry.\n\n\n\n\nIN THE SECOND APRIL\n\n\n_PROEM:--More Properly an Apologue, and Treats of the Fallibility of Soap_\n\nThe Duke of Ormskirk left Halvergate on the following day, after\nparticipation in two dialogues, which I abridge.\n\nSaid the Duke to Lord Humphrey Degge:\n\n\"You have been favored, sir, vastly beyond your deserts. I acquiesce, since\nFate is proverbially a lady, and to dissent were in consequence ungallant.\nShortly I shall find you more employment, at Dover, whither I am now going\nto gull my old opponent and dear friend, Gaston de Puysange, in the matter\nof this new compact between France and England. I shall look for you at\nDover, then, in three days' time.\"\n\n\"And in vain, my Lord Duke,\" said the other.\n\nNow Ormskirk raised one eyebrow, after a fashion that he had.\n\n\"Because I love Marian,\" said Lord Humphrey, \"and because I mean to be less\nunworthy of Marian than I have been heretofore. So that I can no longer be\nyour spy. Besides, in nature I lack aptitude for the trade. Eh, my Lord\nDuke, have you already forgotten how I bungled the affair of Captain\nAudaine and his associates?\"\n\n\n\"But that was a maiden effort. And as I find--at alas! the cost of\ndecrepitude,--the one thing life teaches us is that many truisms are true.\n'Practice makes perfect' is one of them. And faith, when you come to my\nage, Lord Humphrey, you will not grumble at having to soil your hands\noccasionally in the cause of common-sense.\"\n\nThe younger man shook his head. \"A week ago you would have found me\namenable enough to reason, since I was then a sensible person, and to be of\nservice to his Grace of Ormskirk was very sensible,--just as to marry Miss\nAllonby, the young and beautiful heiress, was then the course pre-eminently\nsensible. All the while I loved Marian, you understand. But I clung to\ncommon-sense. Desperately I clung to common-sense. And yet--\" He flung out\nhis hands.\n\n\"Yes, there is by ordinary some plaguy _yet_,\" the Duke interpolated.\n\n\"There is,\" cried Lord Humphrey Degge, \"the swift and heart-grappling\nrecollection of the woman you gave up in the cause of common-sense,--roused\nby some melody she liked, or some shade of color she was wont to wear, or\nby hearing from other lips some turn of speech to which she was addicted.\nMy Lord Duke, that memory wakes on a sudden and clutches you by the throat,\nand it chokes you. And one swears that common-sense--\"\n\n\"One swears that common-sense may go to the devil,\" said his Grace of\nOrmskirk, \"whence I don't say it didn't emanate! And one swears that, after\nall, there is excellent stuff in you! Your idiotic conduct, sir, makes me\nfar happier than you know!\"\n\nAfter some ten paces he turned, with a smile. \"In the matter of soiling\none's hands--Personally I prefer them clean, sir, and particularly in the\ncase of Marian's husband. Had it been I, he must have stuck to prosaic\nsoap; with you in the r\u00f4le there is a difference. Faith, Lord Humphrey,\nthere is a decided difference, and if you be other than a monster of\ndepravity you will henceforth, I think, preserve your hands immaculate.\"\n\nTo Marian the Duke said a vast number of things, prompted by a complaisant\nthrill over the fact that, in view of the circumstances, his magnanimity\nmust to the unprejudiced appear profuse and his behavior tolerably heroic.\n\n\"These are very absurd phrases,\" Marian considered, \"since you will\nnever love anyone, I think--however much you may admire the color of her\neyes,--one-quarter so earnestly as you will always marvel at John Bulmer.\nOr perhaps you have only to wait a little, Jack, till in her time and\nseason the elect woman shall come to you, just as she comes to all\nmen,--and then, for once in your existence, you will be sincere.\"\n\n\"I go, provisionally, to seek this paragon at Dover,\" said his Grace of\nOrmskirk, and he lifted her fingers toward his smiling lips; \"but I shall\nbear in mind, my dear, even in Dover, that sincerity is a devilishly\nexpensive virtue.\"\n\n\nI\n\nIt was on the thirteenth day of April that they signed the Second Treaty of\nDover, which not only confirmed its predecessor of Aix-la-Chapelle, but in\naddition, with the brevity of lightning, demolished the last Stuarts' hope\nof any further aid from France. And the French ambassador subscribed the\nterms with a chuckle.\n\n\"For on this occasion, Jean,\" he observed, as he pushed the paper from him,\n\"I think that honors are fairly even. You obtain peace at home, and in\nIndia we obtain assistance for Dupleix; good, the benefit is quite mutual;\nand accordingly, my friend, I must still owe you one requiting for that\nBavarian business.\"\n\nOrmskirk was silent until he had the churchwarden which he had just ignited\naglow. \"That was the evening I had you robbed and beaten by footpads, was\nit not? Faith, Gaston, I think you should rather be obliged to me, since it\ntaught you never to carry important papers in your pocket when you go about\nyour affairs of gallantry.\"\n\n\"That beating with great sticks,\" the Duc de Puysange considered, \"was the\nheight of unnecessity.\"\n\nAnd the Duke of Ormskirk shrugged. \"A mere touch of verisimilitude, Gaston;\nfootpads invariably beat their victims. Besides, you had attempted to\nmurder me at Aix, you may remember.\"\n\nDe Puysange was horrified. \"My dear friend, when I set Villaneuve upon you\nit was with express orders only to run you through the shoulder. Figure to\nyourself: that abominable St. Severin had bribed your _chef_ to feed you\npowdered glass in a ragout! But I dissented. 'Jean and I have been the\ndearest enemies these ten years past,' I said. 'At every Court in Europe\nwe have lied to each other. If you kill him I shall beyond doubt presently\nperish of ennui.' So, that France might escape a blow so crushing as the\nloss of my services, St. Severin consented to disable you.\"\n\n\"Believe me, I appreciate your intervention,\" Ormskirk stated, with his\nusual sleepy smile; before this he had found amusement in the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of\nhis friend's self-approbation.\n\n\"Not so! Rather you are a monument of ingratitude,\" the other complained.\n\"You conceive, Villaneuve was in price exorbitant. I snap my fingers.\n'For a comrade so dear,' I remark, 'I gladly employ the most expensive of\nassassins.' Yet before the face of such magnanimity you grumble.\" The Duc\nde Puysange spread out his shapely hands. \"I murder you! My adored Jean, I\nhad as lief make love to my wife.\"\n\nOrmskirk struck his finger-tips upon the table. \"Faith, I knew there was\nsomething I intended to ask of you, I want you to get me a wife.\"\n\n\"In fact,\" de Puysange observed, \"warfare being now at an end, it is only\nnatural that you should resort to matrimony. I can assure you it is an\nadmirable substitute. But who is the lucky Miss, my little villain?\"\n\n\"Why, that is for you to settle,\" Ormskirk said. \"I had hoped you might\nknow of some suitable person.\"\n\n\"_Ma foi_, my friend, if I were arbiter and any wife would suit you, I\nwould cordially desire you to take mine, for when a woman so incessantly\nresembles an angel in conduct, her husband inevitably desires to see her\none in reality.\"\n\n\"You misinterpret me, Gaston. This is not a jest. I had always intended\nto marry as soon as I could spare the time, and now that this treaty is\ndisposed of, my opportunity has beyond doubt arrived. I am practically at\nleisure until the autumn. At latest, though, I must marry by August,\nin order to get the honeymoon off my hands before the convocation of\nParliament. For there will have to be a honeymoon, I suppose.\"\n\n\"It is customary,\" de Puysange said. He appeared to deliberate something\nentirely alien to this reply, however, and now sat silent for a matter\nof four seconds, his countenance profoundly grave. He was a hideous man,\n[Footnote: For a consideration of the vexed and delicate question whether\nor no Gaston de Puysange was grandson to King Charles the Second of\nEngland, the reader is referred to the third chapter of La Vrilli\u00e8re's _De\nPuysange et son temps_. The Duke's resemblance in person to that monarch\nwas undeniable.] with black beetling eyebrows, an enormous nose, and an\nunder-lip excessively full; his face had all the calculated ill-proportion\nof a gargoyle, an ugliness so consummate and merry that in ultimate effect\nit captivated.\n\nAt last de Puysange began: \"I think I follow you. It is quite proper that\nyou should marry. It is quite proper that a man who has done so much for\nEngland should leave descendants to perpetuate his name, and with perhaps\nsome portion of his ability--no, Jean, I do not flatter,--serve the England\nwhich is to his heart so dear. As a Frenchman I cannot but deplore that our\nnext generation may have to face another Ormskirk; as your friend who loves\nyou I say that this marriage will appropriately round a successful and\nhonorable and intelligent life. Eh, we are only men, you and I, and it is\nadvisable that all men should marry, since otherwise they might be so happy\nin this colorful world that getting to heaven would not particularly tempt\nthem. Thus is matrimony a bulwark of religion.\"\n\n\"You are growing scurrilous,\" Ormskirk complained, \"whereas I am in perfect\nearnest.\"\n\n\"I, too, speak to the foot of the letter, Jean, as you will soon learn. I\ncomprehend that you cannot with agreeability marry an Englishwoman. You are\ntoo much the personage. Possessing, as you notoriously possess, your pick\namong the women of gentle degree--for none of them would her guardians nor\nher good taste permit to refuse the great Duke of Ormskirk,--any choice\nmust therefore be a too robustious affrontment to all the others. If you\nselect a Howard, the Skirlaws have pepper in the nose; if a Beaufort, you\nlose Umfraville's support,--and so on. Hey, I know, my dear Jean; your\naffair with the Earl of Brudenel's daughter cost you seven seats in\nParliament, you may remember. How am I aware of this?--why, because I\nhabitually have your mail intercepted. You intercept mine, do you not?\nNaturally; you would be a very gross and intolerable scion of the pig if\nyou did otherwise. _Eh bien_, let us get on. You might, of course, play\nKing Cophetua, but I doubt if it would amuse you, since Penelophons are\nrare; it follows in logic that your wife must come from abroad. And whence?\nWithout question, from France, the land of adorable women. The thing is\nplainly demonstrated; and in France, my dear, I have to an eyelash the\nproper person for you.\"\n\n\"Then we may consider the affair as settled,\" Ormskirk replied, \"and should\nyou arrange to have the marriage take place upon the first of August,--if\npossible, a trifle earlier,--I would be trebly your debtor.\"\n\nDe Puysange retorted: \"Beyond doubt I can adjust these matters. And yet,\nmy dear Jean, I must submit that it is not quite the act of a gentleman to\nplunge into matrimony without even inquiring as to the dowry of your future\nbride.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" said Ormskirk, with a grimace; \"I had not thought of her\nportion. You must remember my attention is at present pre-empted by that\nidiotic Ferrers business. How much am I to marry, then, Gaston?\"\n\n\"I had in mind,\" said the other, \"my sister, the Demoiselle Claire de\nPuysange,--\"\n\nIt was a day of courtesy when the minor graces were paramount. Ormskirk\nrose and accorded de Puysange a salutation fitted to an emperor. \"I entreat\nyour pardon, sir, for any _gaucherie_ of which I may have been guilty, and\ndesire to extend to you my appreciation of the honor you have done me.\"\n\n\"It is sufficient, monsieur,\" de Puysange replied. And the two gravely\nbowed again.\n\nThen the Frenchman resumed, in conversational tones: \"I have but one\nunmarried sister,--already nineteen, beautiful as an angel (in the eyes, at\nleast, of fraternal affection), and undoubtedly as headstrong as any devil\nat present stoking the eternal fires below. You can conceive that the\ndisposal of such a person is a delicate matter. In Poictesme there is\nno suitable match, and upon the other hand I grievously apprehend her\npresentation at our Court, where, as Arouet de Voltaire once observed to\nme, the men are lured into matrimony by the memories of their past sins,\nand the women by the immunity it promises for future ones. In England,\nwhere custom will permit a woman to be both handsome and chaste, I estimate\nshe would be admirably ranged. Accordingly, my dear Jean, behold a fact\naccomplished. And now let us embrace, my brother!\"\n\nThis was done. The next day they settled the matter of dowry, jointure, the\nwidow's portion, and so on, and de Puysange returned to render his report\nat Marly. The wedding had been fixed by the Frenchman for St. Anne's day,\nand by Ormskirk, as an uncompromising churchman, for the twenty-sixth of\nthe following July.\n\n\nII\n\nThat evening the Duke of Ormskirk sat alone in his lodgings. His Grace\nwas very splendid in black-and-gold, wearing his two stars of the Garter\nand the Thistle, for there was that night a ball at Lady Sandwich's, and\nRoyalty was to embellish it. In consequence, Ormskirk meant to show his\nplump face there for a quarter of an hour; and the rooms would be too\nhot (he peevishly reflected), and the light would tire his eyes, and\nLaventhrope would button-hole him again about that appointment for\nLaventhrope's son, and the King would give vent to some especially\nfat-witted jest, and Ormskirk would apishly grin and applaud. And afterward\nhe would come home with a headache, and ghostly fiddles would vex him all\nnight long with their thin incessancy.\n\n\"Accordingly,\" the Duke decided, \"I shall not stir a step until eleven\no'clock. The King, in the ultimate, is only a tipsy, ignorant old German\ndebauchee, and I have half a mind to tell him so. Meantime, he can wait.\"\n\nThe Duke sat down to consider this curious lassitude, this indefinite\nvexation, which had possessed him.\n\n\"For I appear to have taken a sudden dislike to the universe. It is\nprobably my liver.\n\n\"In any event, I have come now to the end of my resources. For some\ntwenty-five years it has amused me to make a great man of John Bulmer. Now\nthat is done, and, like the Moorish fellow in the play, 'my occupation's\ngone.' I am at the very top of the ladder, and I find it the dreariest\nplace in the world. There is nothing left to scheme for, and, besides, I am\ntired.\n\n\"The tiniest nerve in my body, the innermost cell of my brain, is tired\nto-night.\n\n\"I wonder if getting married will divert me? I doubt it. Of course I ought\nto marry, but then it must be rather terrible to have a woman loitering\naround you for the rest of your life. She will probably expect me to talk\nto her; she will probably come into my rooms and sit there whenever the\ninclination prompts her,--in a sentence, she will probably worry me to\ndeath. Eh well!--that die is cast!\n\n\"'Beautiful as an angel, and headstrong as a devil.' And what's her\nname?--Oh, yes, Claire. That is a very silly name, and I suppose she is a\nvixenish little idiot. However, the alliance is a sensible one. De Puysange\nhas had it in mind for some six months, I think, but certainly I did not\nthink he knew of my affair with Marian. Well, but he affects omniscience,\nhe delights in every small chicane. He is rather droll. Yesterday he knew\nfrom the start that I was leading up to a proposal for his sister,--and yet\nthere we sat, two solemn fools, and played our tedious comedy to a finish.\n_Eh bien!_ as he says, it is necessary to keep one's hand in.\n\n\"'Beautiful as an angel, and headstrong as a devil'--Alison was not\nheadstrong.\"\n\nOrmskirk rose suddenly and approached an open window. It was a starless\nsight, temperately cool, with no air stirring. Below was a garden of some\nsort, and a flat roof which would be that of the stables, and beyond,\nabrupt as a painted scene, a black wall of houses stood against a\nsteel-colored, vacant sky, reaching precisely to the middle of the vista.\nOnly a solitary poplar, to the rear of the garden, qualified this sombre\nmonotony of right angles. Ormskirk saw the world as an ugly mechanical\ndrawing, fashioned for utility, meticulously outlined with a ruler. Yet\nthere was a scent of growing things to nudge the senses.\n\n\"No, Alison was different. And Alison has been dead near twenty years.\nAnd God help me! I no longer regret even Alison. I should have been more\ntruthful in talking with poor Harry Heleigh. But, as always, the temptation\nto be picturesque was irresistible. Besides, the truth is humiliating.\n\n\"The real tragedy of life is to learn that it is not really tragic. To\nlearn that the world is gross, that it lacks nobility, that to considerate\npersons it must be in effect quite unimportant,--here are commonplaces,\nsweepings from the tub of the immaturest cynic. But to learn that you\nyourself were thoughtfully constructed in harmony with the world you were\nto live in, that you yourself are incapable of any great passion--eh, this\nis an athletic blow to human vanity. Well! I acknowledge it. My love for\nAlison Pleydell was the one sincere thing in my life. And it is dead. I do\nnot think of her once a month. I do not regret her except when I am tipsy\nor bored or listening to music, and wish to fancy myself the picturesque\nvictim of a flint-hearted world. Which is a romantic lie; I move like a\nman of card-board in a card-board world. Certain faculties and tastes and\nmannerisms I undoubtedly possess, but if I have any personality at all,\nI am not aware of it; I am a mechanism that eats and sleeps and clumsily\nperambulates a ball that spins around a larger ball that revolves about\nanother, and so on, _ad infinitum_. Some day the mechanism will be broken.\nOr it will slowly wear out, perhaps. And then it will go to the dust-heap.\nAnd that will be the end of the great Duke of Ormskirk.\n\n\"John Bulmer did not think so. It is true that John Bulmer was a\nmagnanimous fool,--Upon the other hand, John Bulmer would never have stared\nout of an ugly window at an uglier landscape and have talked yet uglier\nnonsense to it. He would have been off post-haste after the young person\nwho is 'beautiful as an angel and headstrong as a devil.' And afterward he\nwould have been very happy or else very miserable. I begin to think that\nJohn Bulmer was more sensible than the great Duke of Ormskirk. I would--I\nwould that he were still alive.\"\n\nHis Grace slapped one palm against his thigh with unwonted vigor. \"Behold,\nwhat I am longing for! I am longing for John Bulmer.\"\n\nPresently he sounded the gong upon his desk. And presently he said: \"My\nadorable Pawsey, the great Duke of Ormskirk is now going to pay his\nrespects to George Guelph, King of Britain, France, and Ireland, defender\nof the faith. Duke of Brunswick and Lunenburg, and supreme head of the\nAnglican and Hibernian Church. And to-morrow Mr. John Bulmer will set forth\nupon a little journey into Poictesme. You will obligingly pack a valise.\nNo, I shall not require you,--for John Bulmer was entirely capable of\ndressing and shaving himself. So kindly go to the devil, Pawsey, and stop\nstaring at me.\"\n\nLater in the evening Pawsey, a thought mellowed by the ale of Dover,\ndeplored with tears the instability of a nation whose pilots were addicted\nto tippling.\n\n\"Drunk as David's sow!\" said Pawsey, \"and 'im in the hactual presence of\n'is Sacred Majesty!\"\n\n\nIII\n\nThus it came about that, five days later, arrived at Bellegarde Mr. John\nBulmer, kinsman and accredited emissary of the great Duke of Ormskirk.\nHe brought with him and in due course delivered a casket of jewels and a\nletter from the Duke to his betrothed. The diamonds were magnificent, and\nthe letter was a paragon of polite ardors.\n\nMr. Bulmer found the ch\u00e2teau in charge of a distant cousin to de Puysange,\nthe Marquis de Soyecourt; with whom were the Duchess, a gentle and\nbeautiful lady, her two children, and the Demoiselle Claire. The Duke\nhimself was still at Marly, with most of his people, but at Bellegarde\nmomentarily they looked for his return. Meanwhile de Soyecourt, an\nexquisite and sociable and immoral young gentleman of forty-one, was\nlonely, and protested that any civilized company was, in the oafish\nprovinces, a charity of celestial pre-arrangement. He would not hear of Mr.\nBulmer's leaving Bellegarde; and after a little protestation the latter\nproved persuadable.\n\n\"Mr. Bulmer,\" the Duke's letter of introduction informed the Marquis, \"is\nmy kinsman and may be regarded as discreet. The evanishment of his tiny\npatrimony, spirited away some years ago by divers over-friendly ladies,\nhath taught the man humility, and procured for me the privilege of paying\nfor his support: but I find him more valuable than his cost. He is\ntolerably honest, not too often tipsy, makes an excellent salad, and will\nconvey a letter or hold a door with fidelity and despatch. Employ his\nservices, monsieur, if you have need of them; I place him at your command.\"\n\nIn fine, they at Bellegarde judged Mr. Bulmer to rank somewhere between\nlackeyship and gentility, and treated him in accordance. It was an age of\nparasitism, and John Bulmer, if a parasite, was the Phormio of a very great\nman: when his patron expressed a desire Mr. Bulmer fulfilled it without\nboggling over inconvenient scruples, perhaps; and there was the worst that\ncould with equity be said of him. An impoverished gentleman must live\nsomehow, and, deuce take it! there must be rather pretty pickings among\nthe broken meats of an Ormskirk. To this effect de Soyecourt moralized one\nevening as the two sat over their wine.\n\nJohn Bulmer candidly assented. \"I live as best I may,\" he said. \"In a word\n'I am his Highness' dog at Kew--' But mark you, I do not complete the\nquotation, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Which ends, as I remember it, 'I pray you, sir, whose dog are you?' Well,\nMr. Bulmer, each of us wards his own kennel somewhere, whether it be in\na king's court or in a woman's heart, and it is necessary that he pay\nthe rent of it in such coin as the owner may demand. Beggars cannot be\nchoosers, Mr. Bulmer.\" The Marquis went away moodily, and John Bulmer\npoured out another glass.\n\n\"Were I Gaston, you would not kennel here, my friend. The Duchess has too\nmany claims to be admired,--for undoubtedly people do go about unchained\nwho can admire a blonde,--and always your eyes follow her. I noticed it a\nweek ago.\"\n\nAnd during this week Mr. Bulmer had seen a deal of Claire de Puysange, with\nresults that you will presently ascertain. It was natural she should desire\nto learn something of the man she was so soon to marry, and of whose\npersonality she was so ignorant; she had not even seen a picture of him, by\nexample. Was he handsome?\n\nJohn Bulmer believed him rather remarkably handsome, when you considered\nhow frequently his love-affairs had left disastrous souvenirs: yes, for a\nman in middle life so often patched up by quack doctors, Ormskirk looked\nwholesome enough, said Mr. Bulmer. He may have had his occult purposes,\nthis poor cousin, but of Ormskirk he undoubtedly spoke with engaging\ncandor. Here was no parasite cringingly praising his patron to the\nskies. The Duke's career was touched on, with its grimy passages no whit\nextenuated: before Dettingen Cousin Ormskirk had, it must be confessed,\ntaken a bribe from de Noailles, and in return had seen to it that the\nEnglish did not follow up their empty victory; and 'twas well known\nOrmskirk got his dukedom through the Countess of Yarmouth, to whom the\nKing could deny nothing. What were the Duke's relations with this liberal\nlady?--a shrug rendered Mr. Bulmer's avowal of ignorance tolerably\nexplicit. Then, too, Mr. Bulmer readily conceded, the Duke's atrocities\nafter Culloden were somewhat over-notorious for denial: all the prisoners\nwere shot out-of-hand; seventy-two of them were driven into an inn-yard\nand massacred _en masse_. Yes, there were women among them, but not over\na half-dozen children, at most. Mademoiselle was not to class his noble\npatron with Herod, understand,--only a few brats of no importance.\n\nIn fine, he told her all the highly colored tales that envy and malice and\nignorance had been able to concoct concerning the great Duke. Many of them\nJohn Bulmer knew to be false; nevertheless, he had a large mythology to\nchoose from, he picked his instances with care, he narrated them with gusto\nand discretion,--and in the end he got his reward.\n\nFor the girl rose, flame-faced, and burlesqued a courtesy in his direction.\n\"Monsieur Bulmer, I make you my compliments. You have very fully explained\nwhat manner of man is this to whom my brother has sold me.\"\n\n\"And wherefore do you accord me this sudden adulation?\" said John Bulmer.\n\n\"Because in France we have learned that lackeys are always powerful. Le Bel\nis here omnipotent, Monsieur Bulmer; but he is lackey to a satyr only; and\ntherefore, I felicitate you, monsieur, who are lackey to a fiend.\"\n\nJohn Bulmer looked rather grave. \"Civility is an inexpensive wear,\nmademoiselle, but it becomes everybody.\"\n\n\"Lackey!\" she flung over her shoulder, as she left him.\n\nJohn Bulmer began to whistle an air then popular across the Channel. Later\nhis melody was stilled.\n\n\"'Beautiful as an angel, and headstrong as a devil!'\" said John Bulmer.\n\"You have an eye, Gaston!\"\n\n\nIV\n\nThat evening came a letter from Gaston to de Soyecourt, which the latter\nread aloud at supper. Gossip of the court it was for the most part,\ngarrulous, and peppered with deductions of a caustic and diverting sort,\nbut containing no word of a return to Bellegarde, in this vocal rendering.\nFor in the reading one paragraph was elided.\n\n\"I arrive,\" the Duke had written, \"within three or at most four days after\nthis will be received. You are to breathe not a syllable of my coming, dear\nLouis, for I do not come alone. Achille Cazaio has intimidated Poictesme\nlong enough; I consider it is not desirable that a peer of France should be\nat the mercy of a chicken-thief, particularly when Fortune whispers, as the\nlady now does:\n\n    \"Viens punir le coupable;\n  Les oracles, les dieux, tout nous est favorable.\n\n\"Understand, in fine, that Madame de Pompadour has graciously obtained for\nme the loan of the dragoons of Entr\u00e9chat for an entire fortnight, so that I\nreturn not in submission, but, like C\u00e6sar and Coriolanus and other exiled\ncaptains of antiquity, at the head of a glorious army. We will harry the\nTaunenfels, we will hang the vile bandit more high than Haman of old, we\nwill, in a word, enjoy the supreme pleasure of the chase, enhanced by the\nknowledge we pursue a note-worthy quarry. Homicide is, after all, the most\nsatisfying recreation life affords us, since man alone knows how thoroughly\nman deserves to be slaughtered. A tiger, now, has his deficiencies,\nperhaps, viewed as a roommate; yet a tiger is at least acceptable to the\neye, a vision very pleasantly suggestive, we will say, of buttered toast;\nwhereas, our fellow-creatures, my dear Louis,--\" And in this strain de\nPuysange continued, with intolerably scandalous examples as parapets for\nhis argument.\n\nThat night de Soyecourt re-read this paragraph. \"So the Pompadour has\nkindly tendered him the loan of certain dragoons? She is very fond of\nGaston, is la petite \u00c9toiles, beyond doubt. And accordingly her dragoons\nare to garrison Bellegarde for a whole fortnight. Good, good!\" said the\nMarquis; \"I think that all goes well.\"\n\nHe sat for a long while, smiling, preoccupied with his imaginings, which\nwere far adrift in the future. Louis de Soyecourt was a subtle little man,\nfreakish and amiable, and, on a minute scale, handsome. He reminded people\nof a dissipated elf; his excesses were notorious, yet always he preserved\nthe face of an ecclesiastic and the eyes of an aging seraph; and bodily\nthere was as yet no trace of the corpulence which marred his later years.\n\nTo-night he slept soundly. His conscience was always, they say, to the very\nend of his long life, the conscience of a child, vulnerable by physical\npunishment, but by nothing else.\n\n\nV\n\nNext day John Bulmer rode through the Forest of Acaire, and sang as he\nwent. Yet he disapproved of the country.\n\n\"For I am of the opinion,\" John Bulmer meditated, \"that France just now is\ntoo much like a flower-garden situate upon the slope of a volcano. The eye\nis pleasantly titillated, but the ear catches eloquent rumblings. This is\nnot a very healthy country, I think. These shaggy-haired, dumb peasants\ntrouble me. I had thought France a nation of de Puysanges; I find it rather\na nation of beasts who are growing hungry. Presently they will begin\nto feed, and I am not at all certain as to the urbanity of their table\nmanners.\"\n\nHowever, it was no affair of his; so he put the matter out of mind, and as\nhe rode through the forest, carolled blithely. Trees were marshalled on\neach side with an effect of colonnades; everywhere there was a sniff of the\ncathedral, of a cheery cathedral all green and gold and full-bodied browns,\nwhere the industrious motes swam, like the fishes fairies angle for, in\nevery long and rigid shaft of sunlight,--or rather (John Bulmer decided),\nas though Time had just passed by with a broom, intent to garnish the least\nnook of Acaire against Spring's occupancy of it. Then there were tiny white\nbutterflies, frail as dream-stuff. There were anemones; and John Bulmer\nsighed at their insolent perfection. Theirs was a frank allure; in the\nsolemn forest they alone of growing things were wanton, for they coquetted\nwith the wind, and their pink was the pink of flesh.\n\nHe recollected that he was corpulent--and forty-five. \"And yet, praise\nHeaven,\" said John Bulmer, \"something stirs in this sleepy skull of mine.\"\n\nSang John Bulmer:\n\n  \"April wakes, and the gifts are good\n  Which April grants in this lonely wood\n  Mid the wistful sounds of a solitude,\n  Whose immemorial murmuring\n  Is the voice of Spring\n  And murmurs the burden of burgeoning.\n\n  \"April wakes, and her heart is high,\n  For the Bassarids and the Fauns are nigh,\n  And prosperous leaves lisp busily\n  Over flattered brakes, whence the breezes bring\n  Vext twittering\n  To swell the burden of burgeoning.\n\n  \"April wakes, and afield, astray,\n  She calls to whom at the end I say.\n  _Heart o' my Heart, I am thine alway_,--\n  And I follow, follow her carolling,\n  For I hear her sing\n  Above the burden of burgeoning.\n\n  \"April wakes;--it were good to live\n  (_Yet April passes_), though April give\n  No other gift for our pleasuring\n  Than the old, old burden of burgeoning--\"\n\nHe paused here. Not far ahead a woman's voice had given a sudden scream,\nfollowed by continuous calls for aid.\n\n\"Now, if I choose, will begin the first fytte of John Bulmer's adventures,\"\nhe meditated, leisurely. \"The woman is in some sort of trouble. If I go to\nher assistance I shall probably involve myself in a most unattractive mess,\nand eventually be arrested by the constable,--if they have any constables\nin this operatic domain, the which I doubt. I shall accordingly emulate the\nexample of the long-headed Levite, and sensibly pass by on the other side.\nHalt! I there recognize the voice of the Duke of Ormskirk. I came into this\ncountry to find John Bulmer; and John Bulmer would most certainly have\nspurred his gallant charger upon the craven who is just now molesting\nyonder female. In consequence, my gallant charger, we will at once proceed\nto confound the dastardly villain.\"\n\nHe came presently into an open glade, which the keen sunlight lit without\nobstruction. Obviously arranged, was his first appraisal of the tableau\nthere presented. A woman in blue half-knelt, half-lay, upon the young\ngrass, while a man, bending over, fettered her hands behind her back.\nA swarthy and exuberantly bearded fellow, attired in green-and-russet,\nstood beside them, displaying magnificent teeth in exactly the grin which\nhieratic art imputes to devils. Yet farther off a Dominican Friar sat upon\na stone and displayed rather more unctuous amusement. Three horses and a\nmule diversified the background. All in all, a thought larger than life, a\nshade too obviously posed, a sign-painter's notion of a heroic picture, was\nJohn Bulmer's verdict. From his holster he drew a pistol.\n\nThe lesser rascal rose from the prostrate woman. \"Finished, my captain,--\"\nhe began. Against the forest verdure he made an excellent mark. John Bulmer\nshot him neatly through the head.\n\nStartled by the detonation, the Friar and the man in green-and-russet\nwheeled about to find Mr. Bulmer, with his most heroical bearing,\nnegligently replacing the discharged pistol. The woman lay absolutely\nstill, face downward, in a clump of fern.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said John Bulmer, \"I lament that your sylvan diversions\nshould be thus interrupted by the fact that an elderly person like myself,\nquite old enough to know better, has seen fit to adopt the pursuit of\nknight-errantry. You need not trouble yourselves about your companion, for\nI have blown out most of the substance nature intended him to think with.\nOne of you, I regret to observe, is rendered immune by the garb of an order\nwhich I consider misguided, indeed, but with which I have no quarrel. With\nthe other I beg leave to request the honor of exchanging a few passes as\nthe recumbent lady's champion.\"\n\n\"Sacred blue!\" remarked the bearded man; \"you presume to oppose, then, of\nall persons, me! You fool, I am Achille Cazaio!\"\n\n\"I deplore the circumstance that I am not overwhelmed by the revelation,\"\nJohn Bulmer said, as he dismounted, \"and I entreat you to bear in mind,\nfriend Achille, that in Poictesme I am a stranger. And, unhappily, the\nnames of many estimable persons have not an international celebrity.\" Thus\nspeaking, he drew and placed himself on guard.\n\nWith a shrug the Friar turned and reseated himself upon the stone. He\nappeared a sensible man. But Cazaio flashed out a long sword and hurled\nhimself upon John Bulmer.\n\nCazaio thus obtained a butcherly thrust in the shoulder, \"Friend Achille,\"\nsaid John Bulmer, \"that was tolerably severe for a first hit. Does it\ncontent you?\"\n\nThe hairy man raged. \"Eh, my God!\" Cazaio shrieked, \"do you mock me, you\nmisbegotten one! Before you can give me such another I shall have settled\nyou outright. Already hell gapes for you. Fool, I am Achille Cazaio!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, you had mentioned that,\" said his opponent. \"And, in return,\nallow me to present Mr. John Bulmer, thoroughly enjoying himself for the\nfirst time in a quarter of a century, Angelo taught me this thrust. Can you\nparry it, friend Achille?\" Mr. Bulmer cut open the other's forehead.\n\n\"Well done!\" Cazaio grunted. He attacked with renewed fury, but now the\nblood was streaming down his face and into his eyes in such a manner that\nhe was momentarily compelled to carry his hand toward his countenance in\norder to wipe away the heavy trickle. John Bulmer lowered his point.\n\n\"Friend Achille, it is not reasonable I should continue our engagement to\nits d\u00e9nouement, since by that boastful parade of skill I have inadvertently\nturned you into a blind man. Can you not stanch your wound sufficiently to\nmake possible a renewal of our exercise on somewhat more equal terms?\"\n\n\"Not now,\" the other replied, breathing heavily,--\"not now, Monsieur\nBulmaire. You have conquered, and the woman is yours. Yet lend me my life\nfor a little till I may meet you more equitably. I will not fail you,--I\nswear it--I, Achille Cazaio.\"\n\n\"Why, God bless my soul!\" said John Bulmer, \"do you imagine that I am\nforming a collection of vagrant females? Permit me, pray, to assist you to\nyour horse. And if you would so far honor me as to accept the temporary\nloan of my handkerchief--\"\n\nSolicitously Mr. Bulmer bound up his opponent's head, and more lately aided\nhim to mount one of the grazing horses. Cazaio was moved to say:\n\n\"You are a gallant enemy, Monsieur Bulmaire. I shall have the pleasure of\ncutting your throat on Thursday next, if that date be convenient to you.\"\n\n\"Believe me,\" said John Bulmer, \"I am always at your disposal. Let this\nspot, then, be our rendezvous, since I am wofully ignorant concerning your\nlocal geography. And meantime, my friend, if I may be so bold, I would\nsuggest a little practice in parrying. You are of Boisrobert's school, I\nnote, and in attack undeniably brilliant, whereas your defence--unvarying\ndefect of Boisrobert's followers!--is lamentably weak.\"\n\n\"I perceive that monsieur is a connoisseur in these matters,\" said\nCazaio; \"I am the more highly honored. Till Thursday, then.\" And with an\ninclination of his bandaged head--and a furtive glance toward the insensate\nwoman,--he rode away singing.\n\nSang Achille Cazaio:\n\n  \"But, oh, the world is wide, dear lass,\n  That I must wander through,\n  And many a wind and tide, dear lass,\n  Must flow 'twixt me and you,\n  Ere love that may not be denied\n  Shall bring me back to you,\n  --Dear lass!\n  Shall bring me back to you.\"\n\nThus singing, he disappeared; meantime John Bulmer had turned toward the\nwoman. The Dominican sat upon the stone, placidly grinning.\n\n\"And now,\" said John Bulmer, \"we revert to the origin of all this\ntomfoolery,--who, true to every instinct of her sex, has caused as much\ntrouble as lay within her power and then fainted. A little water from\nthe brook, if you will be so good. Master Friar,--Hey!--why, you damned\nrascal!\"\n\nAs John Bulmer bent above the woman, the Friar had stabbed John Bulmer\nbetween the shoulders. The dagger broke like glass.\n\n\"Oh, the devil!\" said the churchman; \"what sort of a duellist is this who\nfights in a shirt of Milanese armor!\" He stood for a moment, silent, in\nsincere horror. \"I lack words,\" he said,--\"Oh, vile coward! I lack words to\narraign this hideous revelation! There is a code of honor that obtains all\nover the world, and any duellist who descends to secret armor is, as you\nare perfectly aware, guilty of supersticery. He is no fit associate for\ngentlemen, he is rather the appropriate companion of Korah, Dathan, and\nAbiram in their fiery pit. Faugh, you sneak-thief!\"\n\nJohn Bulmer was a thought abashed, and for an instant showed it. Then,\n\"Permit me,\" he equably replied, \"to point out that I did not come hither\nwith any belligerent intent. My undershirt, therefore, I was entitled to\nregard as a purely natural advantage,--as much so as would have been a\ngreater length of arm, which, you conceive, does not obligate a gentleman\nto cut off his fingers before he fights.\"\n\n\"I scent the casuist,\" said the Friar, shaking his head. \"Frankly, you had\nhoodwinked me: I was admiring you as a second Palmerin; and all the while\nyou were letting off those gasconades, adopting those heroic postures, and\nexhibiting such romantic magnanimity, you were actually as safe from poor\nCazaio as though you had been in Crim Tartary rather than Acaire!\"\n\n\"But the pose was magnificent,\" John Bulmer pleaded, \"and I have a leaning\nthat way when one loses nothing by it. Besides, I consider secret armor to\nbe no more than a rational precaution in any country where the clergy are\naddicted to casual assassination.\"\n\n\"It is human to err,\" the Friar replied, \"and Cazaio would have given me\na thousand crowns for your head. Believe me, the man is meditating some\nhorrible mischief against you, for otherwise he would not have been so\ndamnably polite.\"\n\n\"The information is distressing,\" said John Bulmer; and added, \"This Cazaio\nappears to be a personage?\"\n\n\"I retort,\" said the Friar, \"that your ignorance is even more remarkable\nthan my news. Achille Cazaio is the bugbear of all Poictesme, he is as\npowerful in these parts as ever old Manuel was.\"\n\n\"But I have never heard of this old Manuel either--\"\n\n\"In fact, your ignorance seems limitless. For any child could tell you that\nCazaio roosts in the Taunenfels yonder, with some hundreds of brigands in\nhis company. Poictesme is, in effect, his pocket-book, from which he takes\nwhatever he has need of, and the Duc de Puysange, our nominal lord, pays\nhim an annual tribute to respect Bellegarde.\"\n\n\"This appears to be an unusual country,\" quoth John Bulmer; \"where a\nbrigand rules, and the forests are infested by homicidal clergymen and\nharassed females. Which reminds me that I have been guilty of an act of\nungallantry,--and faith! while you and I have been chatting, the lady, with\na rare discretion, has peacefully come back to her senses.\"\n\n\"She has regained nothing very valuable,\" said the Friar, with a shrug,\n\"Alone in Acaire!\" But John Bulmer had assisted the woman to her feet,\nand had given a little cry at sight of her face, and now he stood quite\nmotionless, holding both her unfettered hands.\n\n\"You!\" he said. And when speech returned to him, after a lengthy interval,\nhe spoke with odd irrelevance. \"Now I appear to understand why God created\nme.\"\n\nHe was puzzled. For there had come to him, unheralded and simply, a sense\nof something infinitely greater than his mind could conceive; and analysis\nmight only pluck at it, impotently, as a wearied swimmer might pluck at the\nsides of a well. Ormskirk and Ormskirk's powers now somehow dwindled from\nthe zone of serious consideration, as did the radiant world, and even the\nwoman who stood before him; trifles, these: and his contentment spurned\nthe stars to know that, somehow, this woman and he were but a part, an\ninfinitesimal part, of a scheme which was ineffably vast and perfect....\nThat was the knowledge he sensed, unwordably, as he regarded this woman\nnow.\n\nShe was tall, just as tall as he. It was a blunt-witted devil who whispered\nJohn Bulmer that, inch paralleling inch, the woman is taller than the\nman and subtly renders him absurd; and that in a decade this woman would\nbe stout. There was no meaning now in any whispering save hers. John\nBulmer perceived, with a blurred thrill,--as if of memory, as if he were\nrecollecting something once familiar to him, a great while ago,--that the\ngirl was tall and deep-bosomed, and that her hair was dark, all crinkles,\nbut (he somehow knew) very soft to the touch. The full oval of her face had\nthroughout the rich tint of cream, so that he now understood the blowziness\nof pink cheeks; but her mouth was vivid. It was a mouth not wholly\ndeficient in attractions, he estimated. Her nose managed to be Roman\nwithout overdoing it. And her eyes, candid and appraising, he found to be\nthe color that blue is in Paradise; it was odd their lower lids should\nbe straight lines, so that when she laughed her eyes were converted into\nright-angled triangles; and it was still more odd that when you gazed into\nthem your reach of vision should be extended until you saw without effort\nfor miles and miles.\n\nAnd now for a longish while these eyes returned his scrutiny, without\nany trace of embarrassment; and whatever may have been the thoughts of\nMademoiselle de Puysange, she gave them no expression. But presently the\ngirl glanced down toward the dead man.\n\n\"It was you who killed him?\" she said. \"You!\"\n\n\"I had that privilege,\" John Bulmer admitted. \"And on Thursday afternoon,\nGod willing, I shall kill the other.\"\n\n\"You are kind, Monsieur Bulmer. And I am not ungrateful. And for that which\nhappened yesterday I entreat your pardon.\"\n\n\"I can pardon you for calling me a lackey, mademoiselle, only upon\ncondition that you permit me to be your lackey for the remainder of your\njaunt. Poictesme appears a somewhat too romantic country for unaccompanied\nwomen to traverse in any comfort.\"\n\n\"My thought to a comma,\" the Dominican put in,--\"unaccompanied ladies\ndo not ordinarily drop from the forest oaks like acorns. I said as much\nto Cazaio a half-hour ago. Look you, we two and Michault,--who formerly\nincited this carcass and, from what I know of him, is by this time\noccupying hell's hottest gridiron,--were riding peacefully toward\nBeaus\u00e9ant. Then this lady pops out of nowhere, and Cazaio promptly\nexpresses an extreme admiration for her person.\"\n\n\"The rest,\" John Bulmer said, \"I can imagine. Oh, believe me, I look\nforward to next Thursday!\"\n\n\"But for you,\" the girl said, \"I would now be the prisoner of that devil\nupon the Taunenfels! Three to one you fought,--and you conquered! I have\nmisjudged you, Monsieur Bulmer. I had thought you only an indolent old\ngentleman, not very brave,--because--\"\n\n\"Because otherwise I would not have been the devil's lackey?\" said John\nBulmer. \"Eh, mademoiselle, I have been inspecting the world for more years\nthan I care to confess; I have observed the king upon his throne, and the\ncaught thief upon his coffin in passage for the gallows: and I suspect\nthey both came thither through taking such employment as chance offered.\nMeanwhile, we waste daylight. You were journeying--?\"\n\n\"To Perdigon,\" Claire answered. She drew nearer to him and laid one\nhand upon his arm. \"You are a gallant man, Monsieur Bulmer. Surely you\nunderstand. Two weeks ago my brother affianced me to the Duke of Ormskirk.\nOrmskirk!--ah, I know he is your kinsman,--your patron,--but you yourself\ncould not deny that the world reeks with his infamy. And my own brother,\nmonsieur, had betrothed me to this perjurer, to that lewd rake, to that\ninhuman devil who slaughters defenceless prisoners, men, women, and\nchildren alike. Why, I had sooner marry the first beggar or the ugliest\nfiend in hell!\" the girl wailed, and she wrung her plump little hands in\ndesperation.\n\n\"Good, good!\" he cried, in his soul. \"It appears my eloquence of yesterday\nwas greater than I knew of!\"\n\nClaire resumed: \"But you cannot argue with Gaston--he merely shrugs. So I\ndecided to go over to Perdigon and marry G\u00e9rard des Roches. He has wanted\nto marry me for a long while, but Gaston said he was too poor. And, O\nMonsieur Bulmer, G\u00e9rard is so very, very stupid!--but he was the only\nperson available, and in any event,\" she concluded, with a sigh of\nresignation, \"he is preferable to that terrible Ormskirk.\"\n\nJohn Bulmer gazed on her considerately. \"'Beautiful as an angel, and\nheadstrong as a devil,'\" was his thought, \"You have an eye, Gaston!\"\nAloud John Bulmer said: \"Your remedy against your brother's tyranny,\nmademoiselle, is quite masterly, though perhaps a trifle Draconic. Yet if\non his return he find you already married, he undoubtedly cannot hand you\nover to this wicked Ormskirk. Marry, therefore, by all means,--but not with\nthis stupid G\u00e9rard.\"\n\n\"With whom, then?\" she wondered.\n\n\"Fate has planned it,\" he laughed; \"here are you and I, and yonder is the\nclergyman whom Madam Destiny has thoughtfully thrown in our way.\"\n\n\"Not you,\" she answered, gravely. \"I am too deeply in your debt, Monsieur\nBulmer, to think of marrying you.\"\n\n\"You refuse,\" he said, \"because you have known for some days past that I\nloved you. Yet it is really this fact which gives me my claim to become\nyour husband. You have need of a man to do you this little service. I know\nof at least one person whose happiness it would be to die if thereby he\nmight save you a toothache. This man you cannot deny--you have not the\nright to deny this man his single opportunity of serving you.\"\n\n\"I like you very much,\" she faltered; and then, with disheartening\nhastiness, \"Of course, I like you very much; but I am not in love with\nyou.\"\n\nHe shook his head at her, \"I would think the worse of your intellect if you\nwere. I adore you. Granted: but that constitutes no cut-throat mortgage.\nIt is merely a state of mind which I have somehow blundered into, and with\nwhich you have no concern. So I ask nothing of you save to marry me. You\nmay, if you like, look upon me as insane; it is the view toward which I\nmyself incline. However, mine is a domesticated mania and vexes no one save\nmyself; and even I derive no little amusement from its manifestations. Eh,\nMonsieur Jourdain may laugh at me for a puling lover!\" cried John Bulmer;\n\"but, heavens! if only he could see the unplumbed depths of ludicrousness I\ndiscover in my own soul! The mirth of Atlas could not do it justice.\"\n\nClaire meditated for a while, her eyes inscrutable and yet not unkindly.\n\"It shall be as you will,\" she said at last. \"Yes, certainly, I will marry\nyou.\"\n\n\"O Mother of God!\" said the Dominican, in profound disgust; \"I cannot marry\ntwo maniacs.\" But, in view of John Bulmer's sword and pistol, he went\nthrough the ceremony without further protest.\n\nAnd something embryonic in John Bulmer seemed to come, with the knave's\nbenediction, into flowerage. He saw, as if upon a sudden, how fine she was;\nall the gracious and friendly youth of her: and he deliberated, dizzily,\nthe awe of her spirited and alert eyes; why, the woman was afraid of him!\nThat sunny and vivid glade had become, to him, an island about which past\nhappenings lapped like a fretted sea. \"Dear me!\" he reflected, \"but I am\nreally in a very bad way indeed.\"\n\nNow Mistress Bulmer gazed shyly at her husband. \"We will go back to\nBellegarde,\" Claire began, \"and inform Louis de Soyecourt that I cannot\nmarry the Duke of Ormskirk, because I have already married you, Jean\nBulmer,--\"\n\n\"I would follow you,\" said John Bulmer, \"though hell yawned between us.\nI employ the particular expression as customary in all these cases of\nromantic infatuation.\"\n\n\"Yet I,\" the Friar observed, \"would, to the contrary, advise removal from\nPoictesme as soon as may be possible. For I warn you that if you return to\nBellegarde, Monsieur de Soyecourt will have you hanged.\"\n\n\"Reverend sir,\" John Bulmer replied, \"do you actually believe this\nconsideration would be to me of any moment?\"\n\nThe Friar inspected his countenance. By and by the Friar said: \"I\nemphatically do not. And to think that at the beginning of our\nacquaintanceship I took you for a sensible person!\" Afterward the Friar\nmounted his mule and left them.\n\nThen silently John Bulmer assisted his wife to the back of one of the\nhorses, and they turned eastward into the Forest of Acaire. Mr. Bulmer's\ncountenance was politely interested, and he chatted pleasantly of the\nforenoon's adventure. Claire told him something of her earlier memories\nof Cazaio. So the two returned to Bellegarde. Then Claire led the way\ntoward the western fa\u00e7ade, where her apartments were, and they came to a\npostern-door, very narrow and with a grating.\n\n\"Help me down,\" the girl said. Immediately this was done; Claire remained\nquite still. Her cheeks were smouldering and her left hand was lying inert\nin John Bulmer's broader palm.\n\n\"Wait here,\" she said, \"and let me go in first. Someone may be on watch.\nThere is perhaps danger--\"\n\n\"My dear,\" said John Bulmer, \"I perfectly comprehend you are about to enter\nthat postern, and close it in my face, and afterward hold discourse with me\nthrough that little wicket. I assent, because I love you so profoundly that\nI am capable not merely of tearing the world asunder like paper at your\ncommand, but even of leaving you if you bid me do so.\"\n\n\"Your suspicions,\" she replied, \"are prematurely marital. I am trying to\nprotect you, and you are the first to accuse me of underhand dealing! I\nwill prove to you how unjust are your notions.\" She entered the postern,\nclosed and bolted it, and appeared at the wicket.\n\n\"The Friar was intelligent,\" said Claire de Puysange, \"and beyond doubt\nthe most sensible thing you can do is to get out of Poictesme as soon as\npossible. You have been serviceable to me, and for that I thank you: but\nthe master of Bellegarde has the right of the low, the middle, and the high\njustice, and if my husband show his face at Bellegarde he will infallibly\nbe hanged. If you claim me in England, Ormskirk will have you knifed in\nsome dark alleyway, just as, you tell me, he disposed of Monsieur Traquair\nand Captain Dungelt. I am sorry, because I like you, even though you are\nfat.\"\n\n\"You bid me leave you?\" said John Bulmer. He was comfortably seated upon\nthe turf.\n\n\"For your own good,\" said she, \"I advise you to.\" And she closed the\nwicket.\n\n\"The acceptance of advice,\" said John Bulmer, \"is luckily optional. I shall\ntherefore go down into the village, purchase a lute, have supper, and I\nshall be here at sunrise to greet you with an aubade, according to the\nancient custom of Poictesme.\"\n\nThe wicket remained closed.\n\n\nVI\n\n\"I will go to Marly, inform Gaston of the entire matter, and then my wife\nis mine. I have tricked her neatly.\n\n\"I will do nothing of the sort. Gaston, can give me the woman's body only.\nI shall accordingly buy me a lute.\"\n\n\nVII\n\nAchille Cazaio on the Taunenfels did not sleep that night....\n\nThe two essays [Footnote: The twenty-first chapter of Du Maillot's _Hommes\nIllustres_; and the fifth of d'Avranches's _Anc\u00eatres de la R\u00e9volution_.\nL\u00f6we has an excellent digest of this data.] dealing with the man have\nscarcely touched his capabilities. His exploits in and about Paris and\nhis Gascon doings, while important enough in the outcome, are but the\ngesticulations of a puppet: the historian's real concern is with the hands\nthat manoeuvered above Cazaio; and whether or no Achille Cazaio organized\nthe riots in Toulouse and Guienne and B\u00e9arn is a question with which, at\nthis late day, there can be little profitable commerce.\n\nOne recommends this Cazaio rather to the spinners of romance: with his\nmorality--a trifle buccaneerish on occasion--once discreetly palliated,\nhistory affords few heroes more instantly taking to the fancy....One casts\na hankering eye toward this Cazaio's rumored parentage, his hopeless and\nlife-long adoration of Claire de Puysange, his dealings with d'Argenson and\nKing Louis le Bien-Aim\u00e9, the obscure and mischievous imbroglios in Spain,\nand finally his aggrandizement and his flame-lit death, as du Maillot,\nsay, records these happenings: and one finds therein the outline of an\nimpelling hero, and laments that our traffic must be with a stolid and less\nlivelily tinted Bulmer. And with a sigh one passes on toward the labor\nprearranged....\n\nTo-night Cazaio's desires were astir, and consciousness of his own power\nwas tempting him. He had never troubled Poictesme much: the Taunenfels were\naccessible on that side, and so long as he confined his depredations to\nthe frontier, the Duc de Puysange merely shrugged and rendered his annual\ntribute; it was not a great sum, and the Duke preferred to pay it rather\nthan forsake his international squabbles to quash a purely parochial\nnuisance like a bandit, who was, too, a kinsman....\n\nMeanwhile Cazaio had grown stronger than de Puysange knew. It was a time\nof disaffection: the more violent here and there were beginning to assert\nthat before hanging a superfluous peasant or two de Puysange ought to bore\nhimself with inquiries concerning the abstract justice of the action. For\neverywhere the irrational lower classes were grumbling about the very\nmiseries and maltreatments that had efficiently disposed of their fathers\nfor centuries: they seemed not to respect tradition: already they were\nposting placards in the Paris boulevards,--\"Shave the King for a monk, hang\nthe Pompadour, and break Machault on the wheel,\"--and already a boy of\ntwelve, one Joseph Guillotin, was running about the streets of Saintes\nyonder. So the commoners flocked to Cazaio in the Taunenfels until, little\nby little, he had gathered an army about him.\n\nAnd at Bellegarde, de Soyecourt had only a handful of men, Cazaio meditated\nto-night. And the woman was there,--the woman whose eyes were blue and\nincurious, whose face was always scornful.\n\nIn history they liken Achille Cazaio to Simon de Montfort, and the Gracchi,\nand other graspers at fruit as yet unripe; or, if the perfervid word of\nd'Avranches be accepted, you may regard him as \"_le Saint-Jean de la\nR\u00e9volution glorieuse_.\" But I think you may with more wisdom regard him as\na man of strong passions, any one of which, for the time being, possessed\nhim utterly.\n\nNow he struck his palm upon the table.\n\n\"I have never seen a woman one-half so beautiful, Dom Michel. I am more\nthan ever in love with her.\"\n\n\"In that event,\" the Friar considered, \"it is, of course, unfortunate she\nshould have a brand-new husband. Husbands are often thought much of when\nthey are a novelty.\"\n\n\"You bungled matters, you fat, mouse-hearted rascal. You could quite easily\nhave killed him.\"\n\nThe Dominican spread out his hands, and afterward reached for the bottle.\n\"Milanese armor!\" said Dom Michel Fr\u00e9gose. [Footnote: The same ecclesiastic\nwho more lately dubbed himself, with Mar\u00e9chal de Richelieu's encouragement,\nl'Abb\u00e9 de Trans, and was discreditably involved in the forgeries of Madame\nde St. Vincent.]\n\n\"Yet I am master of Poictesme,\" Cazaio thundered, \"I have ten men to de\nSoyecourt's one. Am I, then, lightly to be thwarted?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly you could take Bellegarde--and the woman along with the\ncastle,--if you decided they were worth the price of a little killing. I\nthink they are not worth it, I strongly advise you to have up a wench from\nthe village, to put out the light, and exercise your imagination.\"\n\nCazaio shook his head. \"No, Dom Michel, you churchmen live too lewdly to\nunderstand the tyranny of love.\"\n\n\"--Besides, there is that trifling matter of your understanding with de\nPuysange,--and, besides, de Puysange will be here in two days.\"\n\nCazaio snapped his fingers. \"He will arrive after the fair.\" Cazaio\nuncorked the ink-bottle with an august gesture.\n\n\"Write!\" said Achille Cazaio.\n\n\nVIII\n\nAs John Bulmer leisurely ascended from the village the birds were waking.\nWhether day were at hand or no was a matter of twittering debate overhead,\nbut in the west the stars were paling one by one, like candles puffed out\nby the pretentious little wind that was bustling about the turquoise cupola\nof heaven; and eastward Bellegarde showed stark, as though scissored from\na painting, against a sky of gray-and-rose. Here was a world of faint\nambiguity. Here was the exquisite tension of dawn, curiously a-chime with\nJohn Bulmer's mood, for just now he found the universe too beautiful to put\nany actual faith in its existence. He had strayed into Fa\u00ebry somehow--into\nAtlantis, or Avalon, or \"a wood near Athens,\"--into a land of opalescence\nand vapor and delicate color, that would vanish, bubble-like, at the\ndiscreet tap of Pawsey fetching in his shaving-water; meantime John\nBulmer's memory snatched at each loveliness, jealously, as a pug snatches\nbits of sugar.\n\nBeneath her window he paused and shifted his lute before him. Then he\nbegan to sing, exultant in the unreality of everything and of himself in\nparticular.\n\nSang John Bulmer,\n\n    \"Speed forth, my song, the sun's ambassador,\n  Lest in the east night prove the conqueror,\n  The day be slain, and darkness triumph,--for\n  The sun is single, but her eyes are twain.\n\n    \"And now the sunlight and the night contest\n  A doubtful battle, and day bides at best\n  Doubtful, until she waken. 'Tis attest\n  The sun is single.\n\n                  \"But her eyes are twain,--\n  And should the light of all the world delay,\n  And darkness prove victorious? Is it day\n  Now that the sun alone is risen?\n\n                                 \"Nay,\n  The sun is single, but her eyes are twain,--\n  Twain firmaments that mock with heavenlier hue\n  The heavens' less lordly and less gracious blue,\n  And lit with sunlier sunlight through and through,\n\n    \"The sun is single, but her eyes are twain,\n  And of fair things this side of Paradise\n  Fairest, of goodly things most goodly,\"\n\nHe paused here and smote a resonant and louder chord. His voice ascended in\ndulcet supplication.\n\n                                      \"Rise,\n  And succor the benighted world that cries,\n  _The sun is single, but her eyes are twain!_\"\n\n\"Eh--? So it is you, is it?\" Claire was peeping disdainfully from the\nwindow. Her throat was bare, and her dusky hair was a shade dishevelled,\nand in her meditative eyes he caught the flicker of her tardiest dream just\nas it vanished.\n\n\"It is I,\" John Bulmer confessed--\"come to awaken you according to the\nancient custom of Poictesme.\"\n\n\"I would much rather have had my sleep out,\" said she, resentfully. \"In\nperfect frankness, I find you and your ancient customs a nuisance.\"\n\n\"You lack romance, my wife.\"\n\n\"Oh--?\" She was a person of many cryptic exclamations, this bride of his.\nPresently she said: \"Indeed, Monsieur Bulmer, I entreat you to leave\nPoictesme. I have informed Louis of everything, and he is rather furious.\"\n\nJohn Bulmer said, \"Do you comprehend why I have not already played the\nemigrant?\"\n\nAfter a little pause, she answered, \"Yes.\"\n\n\"And for the same reason I can never leave you so long as this gross\nbody is at my disposal. You are about to tell me that if I remain here I\nshall probably be hanged on account of what happened yesterday. There are\ngrounds for my considering this outcome unlikely, but if I knew it to be\ninevitable--if I had but one hour's start of Jack Ketch,--I swear to you I\nwould not budge.\"\n\n\"I am heartily sorry,\" she replied, \"since if I had known you really cared\nfor me--so much--I would never have married you. Oh, it is impossible!\" the\ngirl laughed, with a trace of worriment. \"You had not laid eyes on me until\na week ago yesterday!\"\n\n\"My dear,\" John Bulmer answered, \"I am perhaps inadequately acquainted\nwith the etiquette of such matters, but I make bold to question if love is\nexclusively regulated by clock-ticks. Observe!\" he said, with a sort of\nfury: \"there is a mocking demon in me who twists my tongue into a jest even\nwhen I am most serious. I love you: and I dare not tell you so without\na grin. Then when you laugh at me I, too, can laugh, and the whole\ntransaction can be regarded as a parody. Oh, I am indeed a coward!\"\n\n\"You are nothing of the sort! You proved that yesterday.\"\n\n\"Yesterday I shot an unsuspecting man, and afterward fenced with\nanother--in a shirt of Milanese armor! Yes, I was astoundingly heroic\nyesterday, for the simple reason that all the while I knew myself to be as\nsafe as though I were snug at home snoring under an eider-down quilt. Yet,\nto do me justice, I am a shade less afraid of physical danger than of\nridicule.\"\n\nShe gave him a womanly answer. \"You are not ridiculous, and to wear armor\nwas very sensible of you.\"\n\n\"To the contrary, I am extremely ridiculous. For observe: I am an elderly\nman, quite old enough to be your father; I am fat--No, that is kind of you,\nbut I am not of pleasing portliness, I am just unpardonably fat; and, I\nbelieve, I am not possessed of any fatal beauty of feature such as would\nby ordinary impel young women to pursue me with unsolicited affection:\nand being all this, I presume to love you. To me, at least, that appears\nridiculous.\"\n\n\"Ah, do not laugh!\" she said. \"Do not laugh, Monsieur Bulmer!\"\n\nBut John Bulmer persisted in that curious laughter. \"Because,\" he presently\nstated, \"the whole affair is so very diverting.\"\n\n\"Believe me,\" Claire began, \"I am sorry that you care--so much. I--do not\nunderstand. I am sorry,--I am not sorry,\" the girl said, in a new tone, and\nyou saw her transfigured; \"I am glad! Do you comprehend?--I am glad!\" And\nthen she swiftly closed the window.\n\nJohn Bulmer observed. \"I am perhaps subject to hallucinations, for\notherwise the fact had been previously noted by geographers that heaven is\nimmediately adjacent to Poictesme.\"\n\n\nIX\n\nPresently the old flippancy came back to him, since an ancient custom is\nnot lightly broken; and John Bulmer smiled sleepily and shook his head.\n\"Here am I on my honeymoon, with my wife locked up in the ch\u00e2teau, and with\nme locked out of it. My position savors too much of George Dandin's to be\nquite acceptable. Let us set about rectifying matters.\"\n\nHe came to the great gate of the castle and found two sentries there. He\nthought this odd, but they recognized him as de Soyecourt's guest, and\nafter a whispered consultation admitted him. In the courtyard a lackey took\ncharge of Monsieur Bulmer, and he was conducted into the presence of the\nMarquis de Soyecourt. \"What the devil!\" thought John Bulmer, \"is Bellegarde\nin a state of siege?\"\n\nThe little Marquis sat beside the Duchesse de Puysange, to the rear of a\nlong table with a crimson cover. Their attitudes smacked vaguely of the\njudicial, and before them stood, guarded by four attendants, a ragged and\ndissolute looking fellow whom the Marquis was languidly considering.\n\n\"My dear man,\" de Soyecourt was saying as John Bulmer came into the room\n\"when you brought this extraordinary epistle to Bellegarde, you must\nhave been perfectly aware that thereby you were forfeiting your life.\nAccordingly, I am compelled to deny your absurd claims to the immunity of a\nherald, just as I would decline to receive a herald from the cockroaches.\"\n\n\"That is cowardly,\" the man said. \"I come as the representative of an\nhonorable enemy who desires to warn you before he strikes.\"\n\n\"You come as the representative of vermin,\" de Soyecourt retorted, \"and as\nsuch I receive you. You will therefore, permit me to wish you a pleasant\njourney into eternity. Why, hol\u00e0, madame! here is that vagabond guest of\nours returned to observation!\" The Marquis rose and stepped forward, all\nabeam. \"Mr. Bulmer, I can assure you that I was never more delighted to see\nanyone in my entire life.\"\n\n\"Pardon, monseigneur,\" one of the attendants here put in,--\"but what shall\nwe do with this Achon?\"\n\nThe Marquis slightly turned his head, his hand still grasping John\nBulmer's. \"Why, hang him, of course,\" he said. \"Did I forget to tell you?\nBut yes, take him out, and have him confessed by Fr\u00e8re Joseph, and hang him\nat once.\" The four men removed their prisoner.\n\n\"You find us in the act of dispensing justice,\" the Marquis continued, \"yet\nat Bellegarde we temper it with mercy, so that I shall ask no indiscreet\nquestions concerning your absence of last night.\"\n\n\"But I, monsieur,\" said John Bulmer, \"I, too, have come to demand justice.\"\n\n\"T\u00eate-bleu, Mr. Bulmer! and what can I have the joy of doing for you in\nthat respect?\"\n\n\"You can restore to me my wife.\"\n\nAnd now de Soyecourt cast a smile toward the Duchess, who appeared\ntroubled. \"Would you not have known this was an Englishman,\" he queried,\n\"by the avowed desire for the society of his own wife? They are a mad race.\nAnd indeed, Mr. Bulmer, I would very gladly restore to you this hitherto\nunheard-of spouse if but I were blest with her acquaintance. As it is--\" He\nwaved his hand.\n\n\"I married her only yesterday,\" said John Bulmer, \"and I have reason to\nbelieve that she is now within Bellegarde.\"\n\nHe saw the eyes of de Soyecourt slowly narrow. \"Jacques,\" said the Marquis,\n\"fetch me the pistol within that cabinet.\" The Marquis resumed his seat\nto the rear of the table, the weapon lying before him. \"You may go\nnow, Jacques; this gentleman and I are about to hold a little private\nconversation.\" Then, when the door had closed upon the lackey, de Soyecourt\nsaid, \"Pray draw up a chair within just ten feet of this table, monsieur,\nand oblige me with your wife's maiden name.\"\n\n\"She was formerly known,\" John Bulmer answered, \"as Mademoiselle Claire de\nPuysange.\"\n\nThe Duchess spoke for the first time. \"Oh, the poor man! Monsieur de\nSoyecourt, he is evidently insane.\"\n\n\"I do not know about that,\" the Marquis said, fretfully, \"but in any event\nI hope that no more people will come to Bellegarde upon missions which,\ncompel me to have them hanged. First there was this Achon, and now you, Mr.\nBulmer, come to annoy me.--Listen, monsieur,\" he went on, presently: \"last\nevening Mademoiselle de Puysange announced to the Duchess and me that her\nimpending match with the Duke of Ormskirk must necessarily be broken off,\nas she was already married. She had, she stated, encountered you and a\nclergyman yonder the forest, where, on the spur of the moment, you two had\nespoused each other; and was quite unable to inform us what had become of\nyou after the ceremony. You can conceive that, as a sensible man, I did not\ncredit a word of her story. But now, as I understand it, you corroborate\nthis moonstruck narrative?\"\n\nJohn Bulmer bowed his head. \"I have that honor, monsieur.\"\n\nDe Soyecourt sounded the gong beside him. \"In that event, it is uncommonly\nconvenient to have you in hand. Your return, to Bellegarde I regard\nas opportune, even though I am compelled to attribute it to insanity;\npersonally, I disapprove of this match with Milor Ormskirk, but as Gaston\nis bent upon it, you will understand that in reason my only course is to\nmake Claire a widow as soon as may be possible.\"\n\n\"It is intended, then,\" John Bulmer queried, \"that I am to follow Achon?\"\n\n\"I can but trust,\" said the Marquis, politely, \"that your course of life\nhas qualified you for a superior flight, since Achon's departing, I\napprehend, is not unakin to a descent.\"\n\n\"No!\" the Duchess cried, suddenly; \"Monsieur de Soyecourt, can you not\nsee the man is out of his senses? Let Claire be sent for. There is some\nmistake.\"\n\nDe Soyecourt shrugged. \"Yen know that I can refuse you nothing. Jacques,\"\nhe called, to the appearing lackey, \"request Mademoiselle de Puysange to\nhonor us, if it be convenient, with her presence. Nay, I pray you, do not\nrise, Mr. Bulmer; I am of a nervous disposition, startled by the least\nmovement, and my finger, as you may note, is immediately upon the trigger.\"\n\nSo they sat thus, John Bulmer beginning to feel rather foolish as time wore\non, though actually it was not a long while before Claire had appeared in\nthe doorway and had paused there. You saw a great wave of color flood her\ncountenance, then swiftly ebb. John Bulmer observed, with a thrill, that\nshe made no sound, but simply waited, composed and alert, to find out how\nmuch de Soyecourt knew before she spoke.\n\nThe little Marquis said, \"Claire, this gentleman informs us that you\nmarried him yesterday.\"\n\nTranquilly she inspected her claimant. \"I did not see Monsieur Bulmer at\nall yesterday, so far as I remember. Why, surely, Louis, you did not take\nmy nonsense of last night in earnest?\" she demanded, and gave a mellow\nripple of laughter. \"Yes, you actually believed it; you actually believed\nthat I walked into the forest and married the first man I met there, and\nthat this is he. As it happens I did not; so please let Monsieur Bulmer go\nat once, and put away that absurd pistol--at once, Louis, do you hear?\"\n\nThe Duchess shook her head. \"She is lying, Monsieur de Soyecourt, and\nundoubtedly this is the man.\"\n\nJohn Bulmer went to the girl and took her hand. \"You are trying to save me,\nI know. But need I warn you that the reward of Ananias was never a synonym\nfor felicity?\"\n\n\"Jean Bulmer! Jean Bulmer!\" the girl asked, and her voice was tender; \"why\ndid you return to Bellegarde, Jean Bulmer?\"\n\n\"I came,\" he answered, \"for the absurd reason that I cannot live without\nyou.\"\n\nThey stood thus for a while, both her hands clasped in his, \"I believe\nyou,\" she said at last, \"even though I do not understand at all, Jean\nBulmer.\" And then she wheeled upon the Marquis, \"Yes, yes!\" Claire\nsaid; \"the man is my husband. And I will not have him harmed. Do you\ncomprehend?--you shall not touch him, because you are not fit to touch him,\nLouis, and also because I do not wish it.\"\n\nDe Soyecourt looked toward the Duchess as if for advice. \"It is a nuisance,\nbut evidently she cannot marry Milor Ormskirk so long as Mr. Bulmer is\nalive. I suppose it would be better to hang him out-of-hand?\"\n\n\"Monsieur de Puysange would prefer it, I imagine,\" said the Duchess;\n\"nevertheless, it appears a great pity.\"\n\n\"In nature,\" the Marquis assented, \"we deplore the loss of Mr. Bulmer's\ncompany. Yet as matters stand--\"\n\n\"But they are in love with each other,\" the Duchess pointed out, with a\nsorry little laugh. \"Can you not see that, my friend?\"\n\n\"Hein?\" said the Marquis; \"why, then, it is doubly important that Mr.\nBulmer be hanged as soon as possible.\" He reached for the gong, but Claire\nhad begun to speak.\n\n\"I am not at all in love with him! You are of a profound imbecility,\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne. I think he is a detestable person, because he always looks at you\nas if he saw something extremely ridiculous, but was too polite to notice\nit. He is invariably making me suspect I have a smut on my nose. But in\nspite of that, I consider him a very pleasant old gentleman, and I will not\nhave him hanged!\" With which ultimatum she stamped her foot.\n\n\"Yes, madame,\" said the Marquis, critically; \"after all, she is in love\nwith him. That is unfortunate, is it not, for Milor Ormskirk,--and even for\nAchille Cazaio,\" he added, with a shrug.\n\n\"I fail to see,\" a dignified young lady stated, \"what Cazaio, at least, has\nto do with your galimatias.\"\n\n\"Simply that I received this morning a letter demanding you be surrendered\nto Cazaio,\" de Soyecourt answered as he sounded the gong. \"Otherwise, our\namiable friend of the Taunenfels announces he will attack Bellegarde. I,\nof course, hanged his herald and despatched messengers to Gaston, whom I\nlook for to-morrow. If Gaston indeed arrive to-morrow morning, Mr. Bulmer,\nI shall relinquish you to him; in other circumstances will be laid upon\nme the deplorable necessity of summoning a Protestant minister from\nManneville, and, after your spiritual affairs are put in order, of hanging\nyou--suppose we say at noon?\"\n\n\"The hour suits me,\" said John Bulmer, \"as well as another. But no better.\nAnd I warn you it will not suit the Duke of Ormskirk, either, whose\nrelative--whose very near relative--\" He posed for the astounding\nrevelation.\n\nBut little de Soyecourt had drawn closer to him. \"Mr. Bulmer, I have\nsomehow omitted to mention that two years ago I was at Aix-la-Chapelle,\nwhen the treaty was in progress, and there saw your great kinsman. I cut\nno particular figure at the convocation, and it is unlikely he recalls my\nfeatures; but I remember his quite clearly.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" said John Bulmer, courteously; \"it appears, then, that monsieur\nis a physiognomist?\"\n\n\"You flatter me,\" the Marquis returned. \"My skill in that science enabled\nme to deduce only the veriest truisms--such as that the man who for fifteen\nyears had beaten France, had hoodwinked France, would in France be not\noversafe could we conceive him fool enough to hazard a trip into this\ncountry.\"\n\n\"Especially alone?\" said John Bulmer.\n\n\"Especially,\" the Marquis assented, \"if he came alone. But, ma foi! I am\ndiscourteous. You were about to say--?\"\n\n\"That a comic subject declines to be set forth in tragic verse,\" John\nBulmer answered, \"and afterward to inquire the way to my dungeon.\"\n\n\nX\n\nBut John Bulmer escaped a dungeon after all; for at parting de Soyecourt\ngraciously offered to accept Mr. Bulmer's parole, which he gave willingly\nenough, and thereby obtained the liberty of a tiny enclosed garden, whence\na stairway led to his new apartment on the second floor of what had been\nknown as the Constable's Tower, since du Guesclin held it for six weeks\nagainst Sir Robert Knollys. This was a part of the ancient fortress in\nwhich, they say, Poictesme's most famous hero, Dom Manuel, dwelt and\nperformed such wonders, a long while before Bellegarde was remodeled by\nDuke Florian.\n\nThe garden, gravel-pathed, was a trim place, all green and white. It\ncontained four poplars, and in the center was a fountain, where three\nNereids contended with a brawny Triton for the possession of a turtle whose\nnostrils spurted water. A circle of attendant turtles, half-submerged, shot\ninferior jets from their gaping mouths. It was an odd, and not unhandsome\npiece, [Footnote: Designed by Simon Guillain. This fountain is still to be\nseen at Bellegarde, though the exuberancy of Revolutionary patriotism has\nbereft the Triton of his head and of the lifted arm.] and John Bulmer\ninspected it with appreciation, and then the garden, and having found all\nthings satisfactory, sat down and chuckled sleepily and waited.\n\n\"De Soyecourt has been aware of my identity throughout the entire week!\nFaith, then, I am a greater fool than even I suspected, since this fop of\nthe boulevards has been able to trick me so long. He has some card up his\nsleeve, too, has our good Marquis--Eh, well! Gaston comes to-morrow, and\nthenceforward all is plain sailing. Meantime I conjecture that the poor\ncaptive will presently have visitors.\"\n\nHe had dinner first, though, and at this meal gave an excellent account of\nhimself. Shortly afterward, as he sat over his coffee, little de Soyecourt\nunlocked the high and narrow gate which constituted the one entrance to the\ngarden, and sauntered forward, dapper and smiling.\n\n\"I entreat your pardon, Monsieur le Duc,\" de Soyecourt began, \"that I have\nnot visited you sooner. But in unsettled times, you comprehend, the master\nof a beleaguered fortress is kept busy. Cazaio, I now learn, means to\nattack to-morrow, and I have been fortifying against him. However, I attach\nno particular importance to the man's threats, as I have despatched three\ncouriers to Gaston, one of whom must in reason get to him; and in that\nevent Gaston should arrive early in the afternoon, accompanied by the\ndragoons of Entr\u00e9chat. And subsequently--eh bien! if Cazaio has stirred up\na hornets'-nest he has only himself to thank for it.\" The Marquis snapped\nhis fingers and hummed a merry air, being to all appearance in excellent\nspirits.\n\n\"That is well,\" said John Bulmer,--\"for, believe me, I shall be unfeignedly\nglad to see Gaston once more.\"\n\n\"Decidedly,\" said the Marquis, sniffing, \"they give my prisoners much\nbetter coffee than they deign to afford me, I shall make bold to ask you\nfor a cup of it, while we converse sensibly.\" He sat down opposite John\nBulmer. \"Oh, about Gaston,\" said the Marquis, as he added the sugar--\"it\nis deplorable that you will not see Gaston again, at least, not in this\nnaughty world of ours.\"\n\n\"I am the more grieved,\" said John Bulmer, gravely, \"for I love the man.\"\n\n\"It is necessary, you conceive, that I hang you, at latest, before twelve\no'clock to-morrow, since Gaston is a little too fond of you to fall in with\nmy plans. His premature arrival would in effect admit the bull of equity\ninto the china-shop of my intentions. And day-dreams are fragile stuff,\nMonsieur d'Ormskirk! Indeed, I am giving you this so brief reprieve only\nbecause I am, unwilling to have upon my conscience the reproach of hanging\nwithout due preparation a man whom of all politicians in the universe I\nmost unfeignedly like and respect. The Protestant minister has been sent\nfor, and will, I sincerely trust, be here at dawn. Otherwise--really, I am\ndesolated, Monsieur le Duc, but you surely comprehend that I cannot wait\nupon his leisure.\"\n\nJohn Bulmer cracked a filbert. \"So I am to die to-morrow? I do not presume\nto dictate, monsieur, but I would appreciate some explanation of your\nmotive.\"\n\n\"Which I freely render,\" the Marquis replied. \"When I recognized you a week\nago--as I did at first glance,--I was astounded. That you, the man in all\nthe world most cordially hated by Frenchmen, should venture into France\nquite unattended was a conception to confound belief. Still, here you were,\nand I comprehended that such an opportunity would not rap twice upon\nthe door. So I despatched a letter post-haste to Madame de Pompadour at\nMarly--\"\n\n\"I begin to comprehend,\" John Bulmer said. \"Old Tournehem's daughter\n[Footnote: Mr. Bulmer here refers to a venerable scandal. The Pompadour\nwas, in the eyes of the law, at least, the daughter of Fran\u00e7ois Poisson.]\nhates me as she hates no other man alive. Frankly, monsieur, the little\nstrumpet has some cause to,--may I trouble you for the nut-crackers? a\nthousand thanks,--since I have outwitted her more than once, both in\ndiplomacy and on the battle-field. With me out of the way, I comprehend\nthat France might attempt to renew the war, and our late treaty would be so\nmuch wasted paper. Yes, I comprehend that the woman would give a deal for\nme--But what the devil! France has no allies. She dare not provoke England\njust at present; she has no allies, monsieur, for I can assure you that\nPrussia is out of the game. Then what is the woman driving at?\"\n\n\"Far be it from me,\" said the Marquis, with becoming modesty, \"to meddle\nwith affairs of state. Nevertheless, madame is willing to purchase you--at\nany price.\"\n\nJohn Bulmer slapped his thigh, \"Kaunitz! behold the key. Eh, eh, I have\nit now; not long ago the Empress despatched a special ambassador to\nVersailles,--one Anton Wenzel Kaunitz, a man I never heard of. Why, this\nMoravian count is a genius of the first water. He will combine France and\nAustria, implacable enemies since the Great Cardinal's time. Ah, I have\nit now, monsieur,--Frederick of Prussia has published verses against the\nPompadour which she can never pardon--eh, against the Czaritza, too! Why,\nwhat a thing it is to be a poet! now Russia will join the league. And\nSweden, of course, because she wants Pomerania, which King Frederick\nclaims. Monsieur de Soyecourt, I protest it will be one of the prettiest\nmesses ever stirred up in history! And to think that I am to miss it all!\"\n\n\"I regret,\" de Soyecourt said, \"to deny you the pleasure of participation.\nIn sober verity I regret it. But unluckily, Monsieur d'Ormskirk, your\ndissolution is the sole security of my happiness; and in effect\"--he\nshrugged,--\"you comprehend my unfortunate position.\"\n\n\"One of the prettiest messes ever stirred up in all history!\" John Bulmer\nlamented; \"and I to miss it! The policy of centuries shrugged aside, and\nthe map of the world made over as lightly as if it were one of last year's\ngowns! Decidedly I shall never again cast reflections upon the woman in\npolitics, for this is superb. Why, this coup is worthy of me! And what is\nPetticoat the Second to give you, pray, for making all this possible?\"\n\n\"She will give me,\" the Marquis retorted, \"according to advices received\nfrom her yesterday, a lettre-de-cachet for Gaston de Puysange. Gaston is a\nman of ability, but he is also a man of unbridled tongue. He has expressed\nhis opinion concerning the Pompadour, to cite an instance, as freely as\never did the Comte de Maurepas. You know what happened to de Maurepas. Ah,\nyes, Gaston is undoubtedly a peer of France, but the Pompadour is queen\nof that kingdom. And in consequence--on the day that Madame de Pompadour\nlearns of your death,--Gaston goes to the Bastile.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" John Bulmer assented, \"since imprisonment in the Bastile is by\nordinary the reward of common-sense when manifested by a Frenchman. What\nthe devil, monsieur! The Duchess' uncle, Mar\u00e9chal de Richelieu, has been\nthere four times, and Gaston himself, if I am not mistaken, has sojourned\nthere twice. And neither is one whit the worse for it.\"\n\nThe Marquis sipped his coffee. \"The Bastile is not a very healthy place.\nBesides, I have a friend there,--a gaoler. He was formerly a chemist.\"\n\nJohn Bulmer elevated the right eyebrow. \"Poison?\"\n\n\"Dieu m'en garde!\" The Marquis was appalled. \"Nay, monsieur, merely an\nunforeseeable attack of heart-disease.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah!\" said John Bulmer, very slowly. He presently resumed: \"Afterward\nthe Duchesse de Puysange will be a widow. And already she is fond of you;\nbut unfortunately the Duchess--with every possible deference,--is a trifle\nprudish. I see it all now, quite plainly; and out of pure friendliness,\nI warn you that in my opinion the Duchess is hopelessly in love with her\nhusband.\"\n\n\"We should suspect no well bred lady of provincialism,\" returned the\nMarquis, \"and so I shall take my chance. Believe me, Monsieur le Duc, I\nprofoundly regret that you and Gaston must be sacrificed in order to afford\nme this same chance.\"\n\nBut John Bulmer was chuckling. \"My faith!\" he said, and softly chafed his\nhands together, \"how sincerely you will be horrified when your impetuous\nerror is discovered--just too late! You were merely endeavoring to serve\nyour beloved Gaston and the Duke of Ormskirk when you hanged the rascal\nwho had impudently stolen the woman intended to cement their friendship!\nThe Duke fell a victim to his own folly, and you acted precipitately,\nperhaps, but out of pure zeal. You will probably weep. Meanwhile your\nlettre-de-cachet is on the road, and presently Gaston, too, is trapped\nand murdered. You weep yet more tears--oh, vociferous tears!---and the\nDuchess succumbs to you because you were so devotedly attached to her\nformer husband. And England will sit snug while France reconquers Europe.\nMonsieur, I make you my compliments on one of the tidiest plots ever\nbrooded over.\"\n\n\"It rejoices me,\" the Marquis returned, \"that a conspirator of many years'\nstanding should commend my maiden effort.\" He rose. \"And now, Monsieur\nd'Ormskirk,\" he continued, with extended hand, \"matters being thus amicably\nadjusted, shall we say adieu?\"\n\nJohn Bulmer considered. \"Well,--no!\" said he, at last; \"I commend your\ncleverness, Monsieur de Soyecourt, but as concerns your hand I must confess\nto a distaste.\"\n\nThe Marquis smiled. \"Because at the bottom of your heart you despise me,\"\nhe said. \"Ah, believe me, monsieur, your contempt for de Soyecourt is less\ngreat than mine. And yet I have a weakness for him,--a weakness which\ninduces me to indulge all his desires.\"\n\nHe bowed with ceremony and left the garden.\n\n\nXI\n\nJohn Bulmer sat down to consider more at leisure these revelations. He\nforeread like a placard Jeanne d'\u00c9toiles' magnificent scheme: it would\nconvulse all Europe. England would remain supine, because Henry Pelham\ncould hardly hold the ministry together, even now; Newcastle was a fool;\nand Ormskirk would be dead. He would barter his soul for one hour of\nliberty, he thought. A riot, now,--ay, a riot in Paris, a blow from within,\nwould temporarily stupefy French enterprise and gain England time for\npreparation. And a riot could be arranged so easily! Meanwhile he was a\nprisoner, Pelham's hands were tied, and Newcastle was a fool, and the\nPompadour was disastrously remote from being a fool.\n\n\"It is possible to announce that I am the Duke of Ormskirk--and to what\nend? Faith, I had as well proclaim myself the Pope of Rome or the Cazique\nof Mexico: the jackanapes will effect to regard my confession as the device\nof a desperate man and will hang me just the same; and his infernal comedy\nwill go on without a hitch. Nay, I am fairly trapped, and Monsieur de\nSoyecourt holds the winning hand--Now that I think of it he even has, in\nMr. Bulmer's letter of introduction, my formally signed statement that I\nam not Ormskirk. It was tactful of the small rascal not to allude to that\ncrowning piece of stupidity: I appreciate his forbearance. But even so, to\nbe outwitted--and hanged---by a smirking Hop-o'-my-thumb!\n\n\"Oh, this is very annoying!\" said John Bulmer, in his impotence.\n\nHe sat down once more, sulkily, like an overfed cat, and began to read with\ndesperate attention: \"'Here may men understand that be of worship, that he\nwas never formed that at every time might stand, but sometimes he was put\nto the worse by evil fortune. And at sometimes the worse knight putteth\nthe better knight into rebuke.' Behold a niggardly salve rather than a\npanacea.\" He turned several pages. \"'And then said Sir Tristram to Sir\nLamorake, \"I require you if ye happen to meet with Sir Palomides--\"'\"\nStartled, John Bulmer glanced about the garden.\n\nIt turned on a sudden into the primal garden of Paradise. \"I came,\" she\nloftily explained, \"because I considered it my duty to apologize in person\nfor leading you into great danger. Our scouts tell us that already Cazaio\nis marshalling his men upon the Taunenfels.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" John Bulmer said, as he arose, and put away his book,\n\"Bellegarde is a strong place. And our good Marquis, whatever else he may\nbe, is neither a fool nor a coward.\"\n\nClaire shrugged. \"Cazaio has ten men to our one. Yet perhaps we can hold\nout till Gaston comes with his dragoons. And then--well, I have some\ninfluence with Gaston. He will not deny me,--ah, surely he will not deny me\nif I go down on my knees to him and wear my very prettiest gown. Nay, at\nbottom Gaston is kind, my friend, and he will spare you.\"\n\n\"To be your husband?\" said John Bulmer.\n\nTwice she faltered \"No.\" And then she cried, with a sudden flare of\nirritation: \"I do not love you! I cannot help that. Oh, you--you\nunutterable bully!\"\n\nGravely he shook his head at her.\n\n\"But indeed you are a bully. You are trying to bully me into caring for\nyou, and you know it. What else moved you to return to Bellegarde, and to\nsit here, a doomed man, tranquilly reading? Yes, but you were,--I happened\nto see you, through the key-hole in the gate. And why else should you be\ndoing that unless you were trying to bully me into admiring you?\"\n\n\"Because I adore you,\" said John Bulmer, taking affairs in order; \"and\nbecause in this noble and joyous history of the great conqueror and\nexcellent monarch, King Arthur, I find much diverting matter; and because,\nto be quite frank, Claire, I consider an existence without you neither\nalluring nor possible.\"\n\nShe had noticeably pinkened. \"Oh, monsieur,\" the girl cried, \"you are\nlaughing because you are afraid that I will laugh at what you are saying to\nme. Believe me, I have no desire to laugh. It frightens me, rather. I had\nthought that nowadays no man could behave with a foolishness so divine. I\nhad thought all such extravagancy perished with the Launcelot and Palomides\nof your book. And I had thought--that in any event, you had no earthly\nright to call me Claire.\"\n\n\"Superficially, the reproach is just,\" he assented, \"but what was the\nname your Palomides cried in battle, pray? Was it not _Ysoude!_ when his\nsearching sword had at last found the joints of his adversary's armor, or\nwhen the foe's helmet spouted blood? _Ysoude!_ when the line of adverse\nspears wavered and broke, and the Saracen was victor? Was it not _Ysoude!_\nhe murmured riding over alien hill and valley in pursuit of the Questing\nBeast?--'the glatisant beast'? Assuredly, he cried _Ysoude!_ and meantime\nLa Beale Ysoude sits snug in Cornwall with Tristram, who dons his armor\nonce in a while to roll Palomides in the sand _coram populo_. Still the\nname was sweet, and I protest the Saracen had a perfect right to mention it\nwhenever he felt so inclined.\"\n\n\"You jest at everything,\" she lamented--\"which is one of the many traits\nthat I dislike in you.\"\n\n\"Knowing your heart to be very tender,\" he submitted, \"I am endeavoring to\npresent as jovial and callous an appearance as may be possible--to you,\nwhom I love as Palomides loved Ysoude. Otherwise, you might be cruelly\nupset by your compassion and sympathy. Yet stay; is there not another\nsimilitude? Assuredly, for you love me much as Ysoude loved Palomides. What\nthe deuce is all this lamentation to you? You do not value it the beard of\nan onion,--while of course grieving that your friendship should have been\nso utterly misconstrued, and wrongly interpreted,--and--trusting that\nnothing you have said or done has misled me--Oh, but I know you women!\"\n\n\"Indeed, I sometimes wonder,\" she reflected, \"what sort of women you have\nbeen friends with hitherto? They must have been very patient of nonsense.\"\n\n\"Ah, do you think so?--At all events, you interrupt my peroration. For we\nhave fought, you and I, a--battle which is over, so far as I am concerned.\nAnd the other side has won. Well! Pompey was reckoned a very pretty fellow\nin his day, but he took to his heels at Pharsalia, for all that; and\nHannibal, I have heard, did not have matters entirely his own way at Zama.\nGood men have been beaten before this. So, without stopping to cry over\nspilt milk,--heyho!\" he interpolated, with a grimace, \"it was uncommonly\nsweet milk, though,--let's back to our tents and reckon up our wounds.\"\n\n\"I am decidedly of the opinion,\" she said, \"that for all your talk you\nwill find your heart unscratched.\" Irony bewildered Claire, though she\ninvariably recognized it, and gave it a polite smile.\n\nJohn Bulmer said: \"Faith, I do not intend to flatter your vanity by going\ninto a decline on the spot. For in perfect frankness, I find no mortal\nwounds anywhere. No, we have it on the best authority that, while many men\nhave died from time to time, and worms have eaten them, it was never for\nlove. I am inclined to agree with Rosalind: an aneurism may be fatal, but\na broken heart kills nobody. Lovers have died in divers manners since the\nantique world was made, but not the most luckless of them was slain by\nlove. Even Palomides, as my book informs me, went abroad with Launcelot and\nprobably died an old man here in France,--peaceably, in his bed, with the\nfamily physician in attendance, and every other circumstance becoming to\na genteel demise. And I dare assert that long before this he had learned\nto chuckle over his youthful follies, and had protested to his wife that\nLa Beale Ysoude squinted, or was freckled, or the like; and had insisted,\nlaughingly, that the best of us must sow our wild oats. And at the last it\nwas his wife who mixed his gruel and smoothed his pillow and sat up with\nhim at night; so that if he died thinking of Madame Palomides rather than\nof La Beale Ysoude, who shall blame him? Not I, for one,\" said John Bulmer,\nstoutly; \"If it was not heroic, it was at least respectable, and, above\nall, natural; and I expect some day to gasp out a similar valedictory. No,\nnot to-morrow at noon, I think: I shall probably get out of this, somehow.\nAnd when, in any event, I set about the process of dying, I may be thinking\nof you, O fair lost lady! and again I may not be thinking of you. Who can\nsay? A fly, for instance, may have lighted upon my nose and his tickling\nmay have distracted my ultimate thoughts. Meanwhile, I love you consumedly,\nand you do not care a snap of your fingers for me.\"\n\n\"I--I am sorry,\" she said, inadequately.\n\n\"You are the more gracious.\" And his face sank down into his hands, and\nClaire was forgotten, for he was remembering Alison Pleydell and that\nancient bankruptcy of his heart in youth, and this preposterous old John\nBulmer (he reflected) was simply revelling in pity for himself.\n\nA hand, feather-soft, fell upon, his shoulder, \"And who was your Ysoude,\nJean Bulmer?\"\n\n\"A woman who died twenty years ago,--a woman dead before you were born, my\ndear.\"\n\nClaire gave a little stifled moan, \"Oh--oh, I loathe her!\" she cried.\n\nBut when he raised his head Claire was gone.\n\n\nXII\n\nHe sat long in the twilight, now; rising insensibly about him. The garden\nhad become a grave, yet not unfriendly, place; the white straining Nereids\nwere taking on a tinge of violet, the verdure was of a deeper hue, that was\nall; and the fountain plashed unhurriedly, as though measuring a reasonable\ninterval (he whimsically imagined) between the asking of a riddle and its\nsolution given gratis by the asker.\n\nHe loved the woman; granted: but did not love rise the higher above a\ncorner-stone of delusion? And this he could never afford. He considered\nClaire to be not extravagantly clever, he could have improved upon her\nears (to cite one instance), which were rather clumsily modelled; her\nfinger-tips were a thought too thick, a shade too practical, and in fine\nshe was no more the most beautiful woman in the world than she was the\ntallest: and yet he loved her as certainly he had loved none of his recent\nmistresses. Even so, here was no infatuation, no roseate and kindly haze\nsurrounding a goddess, such as that which had by ordinary accompanied\nAlison Pleydell....\n\n\"I am grown older, perhaps. Perhaps it is merely that I am fashioned of\nbaser stuff than---say, Achille Cazaio or de Soyecourt. Or perhaps it\nis that this overmastering, all-engulfing love is a mere figment of the\npoet, an age-long superstition as zealously preserved as that of the\ninscrutability of women, by men who don't believe a syllable of the\nnonsense they are transmitting. Ysoude is dead; and I love my young\nFrench wife as thoroughly as Palomides did, with as great a passion as\nwas possible to either of us oldsters. Well! all life is a compromise; I\ncompromise with tradition by loving her unselfishly, by loving her with the\nvery best that remains in John Bulmer.\n\n\"And yet, I wish--\n\n\"True, I may be hanged at noon to-morrow, which would somewhat disconcert\nmy plan. I shall not bother about that. Always there remains the chance\nthat, somehow, Gaston may arrive in time: otherwise--why, otherwise I shall\nbe hanged, and as to what will happen afterward I decline to enter into any\ndiscussion even with myself. I have my belief, but it is bolstered by no\niota of knowledge. Faith, let us live this life as a gentleman should, and\nkeep our hands and our consciences as clean as may be possible, and for the\noutcome trust to God's common-sense. There are people who must divert Him\nvastly by their frantic efforts to keep out of hell. For my own part, I\nwould not think of wearing a pelisse in the Desert of Sahara merely because\nI happened to be sailing for Greenland during the ensuing week. I shall\ntrust to His common-sense.\n\n\"And yet, I wish--\n\n\"I wish Reinault would hurry with the supper-trays. I am growing very\nhungry.\"\n\n\nXIII\n\nThat night he was roused by a tapping at his door. \"Jean Bulmer, Jean\nBulmer! I have bribed Reinault. I have the keys. Come, and I will set you\nfree.\"\n\n\"Free to do what?\" said John Bulmer.\n\n\"To escape--to flee to your foggy England,\" said the voice without,--\"and\nto your hideous Englishwomen.\"\n\n\"Do you go with me?\" said John Bulmer.\n\n\"I do not.\" This was spoken from the turrets of decision.\n\n\"In that event,\" said John Bulmer, \"I shall return to my dreams, which I\ninfinitely prefer to the realities of a hollow existence. And, besides, now\none thinks of it, I have given my parole.\"\n\nAn infuriate voice came through the key-hole. \"You are undoubtedly a\nbully,\" it stated. \"I loathe you.\" Followed silence.\n\nPresently the voice said, \"Because if you really loved her you were no\nbetter than she was, and so I hate you both.\"\n\n\"'Beautiful as an angel, and headstrong as a devil,'\" was John Bulmer's\nmeditation. Afterward John Bulmer turned over and went back to sleep.\n\nFor after all, as he reflected, he had given his parole.\n\n\nXIV\n\nHe was awakened later by a shriek that was followed by a hubbub of tumult.\nJohn Bulmer sat erect in bed. He heard a medley of yelling, of musketry,\nand of crashes, like the dilapidation of falling battlements. He knew well\nenough what had happened. Cazaio and his men were making a night attack\nupon Bellegarde.\n\nJohn Bulmer arose and, having lighted two candles, dressed himself. He cast\naside the first cravat as a failure, knotted the second with scrupulous\nnicety, and afterward sat down, facing the door to his apartment, and\ntrimmed his finger nails. Outside was Pandemonium, and the little scrap of\nsky visible from his one window was now of a sullen red.\n\n\"It is very curious I do not suffer more acutely. As a matter of fact, I\nam not conscious of any particular feeling at all. I believe that most of\nus when we are confronted with a situation demanding high joy or agony\nfind ourselves devoid of emotion. They have evidently taken de Soyecourt\nby surprise. She is yonder in that hell outside and will inevitably be\ncaptured by its most lustful devil--or else be murdered. I am here like\na trapped rat, impotent, waiting to be killed, which Cazaio's men will\npresently attend to when they ransack the place and find me. And I feel\nnothing, absolutely nothing.\n\n\"By this she has probably fallen into Cazaio's power--\"\n\nAnd the man went mad. He dashed upon the locked door, and tore at it with\nsoft-white hands, so that presently they were all blood. He beat his face\nupon the door, cutting open his forehead.\n\nHe shook his bleeding hands toward heaven. \"In my time I have been cruel. I\nam less cruel than You! Let me go!\"\n\nThe door opened and she stood upon the threshold. His arms were about her\nand repeatedly he kissed her, mercilessly, with hard kisses, crushing her\nin his embrace.\n\n\"Jean, Jean!\" she sobbed, beneath his lips, and lay quite still in his\narms. He saw how white and tender a thing she was, and the fierce embrace\nrelaxed.\n\n\"You came to me!\" he said.\n\n\"Louis had forgotten you. They had all retreated to the Inner Tower.\n[Footnote: The inner ward, or ballium, which (according to Quinault) was\ndefended by ten towers, connected by an embattled stone wall about thirty\nfeet in height and eight feet thick, on the summit of which was a footway;\nnow demolished to make way for the famous gardens.] Cazaio cannot take\nthat, for he has no cannon. Louis can hold out there until Gaston comes\nwith help,\" Claire rapidly explained. \"But the thieves are burning\nBellegarde. I could bribe no man to set you free. They were afraid to\nventure.\"\n\n\"And you came,\" said John Bulmer--\"you left the tall safe Inner Tower to\ncome to me!\"\n\n\"I could not let you die, Jean Bulmer.\"\n\n\"Why, then I must live not unworthily the life which, you have given me. O\nGod!\" John Bulmer cried, \"what a pitiful creature was that great Duke of\nOrmskirk! Now make a man of me, O God!\"\n\n\"Listen, dear madman,\" she breathed; \"we cannot go out into Bellegarde.\nThey are everywhere--Cazaio's men. They are building huge fires about the\nInner Tower; but it is all stone, and I think Louis can hold out. But we,\nJean Bulmer, can only retreat to the roofing of this place. There is a\ntrap-door to admit you to the top, and there--there we can at least live\nuntil the dawn.\"\n\n\"I am unarmed,\" John Bulmer said; \"and weaponless, I cannot hold even a\ntrap-door against armed men.\"\n\n\"I have brought you weapons,\" Claire returned, and waved one hand toward\nthe outer passageway. \"Naturally I would not overlook that. There were many\ndead men on my way hither, and they had no need of weapons. I have a sword\nhere and two pistols.\"\n\n\"You are,\" said John Bulmer, with supreme conviction, \"the most wonderful\nwoman in the universe. By all means let us get to the top of this infernal\ntower and live there as long as we may find living possible. But first,\nwill you permit me to make myself a thought tidier? For in my recent\nagitation as to your whereabouts I have, I perceive, somewhat disordered\nboth my person and my apparel.\"\n\nClaire laughed a little sadly. \"You have been sincere for once in your\nexistence, and you are hideously ashamed, is it not? Ah, my friend, I would\nlike you so much better if you were not always playing at life, not always\nposing as if for your portrait.\"\n\n\"For my part,\" he returned, obscurely, from the rear of a wet towel, \"I\nfail to perceive any particular merit in dying with a dirty face. We are\nabout to deal with a most important and, it well may be, the final crisis\nof our lives. So let us do it with decency.\"\n\nAfterward John Bulmer changed his cravat, since the one he wore was soiled\nand crumpled and stained a little with his blood; and they went up the\nwinding stairway to the top of the Constable's Tower. These two passed\nthrough the trap-door into a moonlight which drenched the world; westward\nthe higher walls of the Hugonet Wing shut off that part of Bellegarde where\nmen were slaughtering one another, and turrets, black and untenanted, stood\nin strong relief against a sky of shifting crimson and gold. At their feet\nwas the tiny enclosed garden half-hidden by the poplar boughs. To the east\nthe Tower dropped sheer to the moat; and past that was the curve of the\nhighway leading to the main entrance of the ch\u00e2teau, and beyond this road\nyou saw Amneran and the moonlighted plains of the Duardenez, and one little\ntributary, a thread of pulsing silver, in passage to the great river which\nshowed as a smear of white, like a chalk-mark on the world's rim.\n\nJohn Bulmer closed the trap-door. They stood with clasped hands, eyes\nstraining toward the east, whence help must arrive if help came at all.\n\n\"No sign of Gaston,\" the girl said. \"We most die presently, Jean Bulmer.\"\n\n\"I am sorry,\" he said,--\"Oh, I am hideously sorry that we two must die.\"\n\n\"I am not afraid, Jean Bulmer. But life would be very sweet, with you.\"\n\n\"That was my thought, too.... I have always bungled this affair of living,\nyou conceive. I had considered the world a healthy and not intolerable\nprison, where each man must get through his day's work as best he might,\nsoiling his fingers as much as necessity demanded--but no more,--so that at\nthe end he might sleep soundly--or perhaps that he might go to heaven and\npluck eternally at a harp, or else to hell and burn eternally, just as\ndivines say we will. I never bothered about it, much, so long as there was\nmy day's work at hand, demanding performance. And in consequence I missed\nthe whole meaning of life.\"\n\n\"That is not so!\" Claire replied. \"No man has achieved more, as everybody\nknows.\"\n\nThis was an odd speech. But he answered, idly: \"Eh, I have done well\nenough as respectable persons judge these matters. And I went to church on\nSundays, and I paid my tithes. Trifles, these, sweetheart; for in every\nman, as I now see quite plainly, there is a god. And the god must judge,\nand the man himself must be the temple and the instrument of the god. It is\nvery simple, I see now. And whether he go to church or no is a matter of\ntrivial importance, so long as the man obeys the god who is within him.\"\nJohn Bulmer was silent, staring vaguely toward the blank horizon.\n\n\"And now that you have discovered this,\" she murmured, \"therefore you wish\nto live?\"\n\n\"Why, partly on account of that,\" he said, \"yet perhaps mostly on account\nof you.... But heyho!\" said John Bulmer; \"I am disfiguring my last hours\nby inflicting upon a lady my half-baked theology. Let us sit down, my\ndear, and talk of trifles till they find us. And then I will kill you,\nsweetheart, and afterward myself. Presently come dawn and death; and my\nheart, according to the ancient custom of Poictesme, is crying, '_Oy\nDieus! Oy Dieus, de l'alba tantost ve!_' But for all that, my mouth will\nresolutely discourse of the last Parisian flounces, or of your unfathomable\neyes, or of Monsieur de Voltaire's new tragedy of _Oreste_,--or, in fine,\nof any topic you may elect.\"\n\nHe smiled, with a twinging undercurrent of regret that not even in\nimpendent death did he find any stimulus to the heroical. But the girl had\ngiven a muffled cry.\n\n\"Look, Jean! Already they come for us.\"\n\nThrough the little garden a man was running, running frenziedly from\none wall to another when he found the place had no outlet save the gate\nthrough which he had scuttled. It was fat Guiton, the steward of the Duc de\nPuysange. Presently came Achille Cazaio with a wet sword, and harried the\nunarmed old man, wantonly driving him about the poplars, pricking him in\nthe quivering shoulders, but never killing him. All the while the steward\nscreamed with a monotonous shrill wailing.\n\nAfter a little he fell at Cazaio's feet, shrieking for mercy.\n\n\"Fool!\" said the latter, \"I am Achille Cazaio. I have no mercy in me.\"\n\nHe kicked the steward in the face two or three times, and Guiton, his\ncountenance all blood, black in the moonlight, embraced the brigand's\nand wept. Presently Cazaio slowly drove his sword into the back of the\nprostrate man, who shrieked, \"O Jesu!\" and began to cough and choke. Five\ntimes Cazaio spitted the writhing thing, and afterward was Guiton's soul\nreleased from the tortured body.\n\n\"Is it well, think you,\" said John Bulmer, \"that I should die without first\nkilling Achille Cazaio?\"\n\n\"No!\" the girl answered, fiercely.\n\nThen John Bulmer leaned upon the parapet of the Constable's Tower and\ncalled aloud, \"Friend Achille, your conduct disappoints me.\"\n\nThe man started, peered about, and presently stared upward. \"Monsieur\nBulmaire, to encounter you is indeed an unlooked-for pleasure. May I\ninquire wherein I have been so ill-fated as to offend?\"\n\n\"You have an engagement to fight me on Thursday afternoon, friend Achille,\nso that to all intent I hold a mortgage on your life. I submit that, in\nconsequence, you have no right to endanger that life by besieging castles\nand wasting the night in assassinations.\"\n\n\"There is something in what you say, Monsieur Bulmaire,\" the brigand\nreplied, \"and I very heartily apologize for not thinking of it earlier.\nBut in the way of business, you understand,--However, may I trust it will\nplease you to release me from this inconvenient obligation?\" Cazaio added,\nwith a smile. \"My men are waiting for me yonder, you comprehend.\"\n\n\"In fact,\" said John Bulmer, hospitably, \"up here the moonlight is as clear\nas day. We can settle our affair in five minutes.\"\n\n\"I come,\" said Cazaio, and plunged into the entrance to the Constable's\nTower.\n\n\"The pistol! quick!\" said Claire.\n\n\"And for what, pray?\" said John Bulmer.\n\n\"So that from behind, as he lifts the trap-door, I may shoot him through\nthe head. Do you stand in front as though to receive him. It will be quite\nsimple.\"\n\n\nXV\n\n\"My dear creature,\" said John Bulmer, \"I am now doubly persuaded that God\nentirely omitted what we term a sense of honor when He created the woman. I\nmean to kill this rapscallion, but I mean to kill him fairly.\" He unbolted\nthe trap-door and immediately Cazaio stood upon the roof, his sword drawn.\n\nAchille Cazaio stared at the tranquil woman, and now his countenance\nwas less that of a satyr than of a demon. \"At four in the morning!\nI congratulate you, Monsieur Bulmaire,\" he said,--\"Oh, decidedly, I\ncongratulate you.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said John Bulmer, sword in hand; \"yes, we were married\nyesterday.\"\n\nCazaio drew a pistol from his girdle and fired full in John Bulmer's face;\nbut the latter had fallen upon one knee, and the ball sped harmlessly above\nhim.\n\n\"You are very careless with fire-arms,\" John Bulmer lamented, \"Really,\nfriend Achille, if you are not more circumspect you will presently injure\nsomebody, and will forever afterward be consumed with unavailing regret and\ncompunctions. Now let us get down to our affair.\"\n\nThey crossed blades in the moonlight, Cazaio was in a disastrous condition;\nJohn Bulmer's tolerant acceptance of any meanness that a Cazaio might\nattempt, the vital shame of this new and baser failure before Claire's very\neyes, had made of Cazaio a crazed beast. He slobbered little flecks of\nfoam, clinging like hoar-frost to the tangled beard, and he breathed with\nshuddering inhalations, like a man in agony, the while that he charged\nwith redoubling thrusts. The Englishman appeared to be enjoying himself,\ndiscreetly; he chuckled as the other, cursing, shifted from tierce to\nquart, and he met the assault with a nice inevitableness. In all, each\nmovement had the comely precision of finely adjusted clockwork, though\nat times John Bulmer's face showed a spurt of amusement roused by the\nbrigand's extravagancy of gesture and Cazaio's contortions as he strove to\npass the line of steel that flickered cannily between his sword and John\nBulmer's portly bosom.\n\nThen John Bulmer, too, attacked. \"For Guiton!\" said he, as his point\nslipped into Cazaio's breast. John Bulmer recoiled and lodged another\nthrust in the brigand's throat. \"For attempting to assassinate me!\" His\nfoot stamped as his sword ran deep into Cazaio's belly. \"For insulting my\nwife by thinking of her obscenely! You are a dead man, friend Achille.\"\n\nCazaio had dropped his sword, reeling as if drunken against the western\nbattlement. \"My comfort,\" he said, hoarsely, while one hand tore at his\njetting throat--\"my comfort is that I could not perish slain by a braver\nenemy.\" He moaned and stumbled backward. Momentarily his knees gripped the\nlow embrasure. Then his feet flipped upward, convulsively, so that John\nBulmer saw the man's spurs glitter and twitch in the moonlight, and John\nBulmer heard a snapping and crackling and swishing among the poplars, and\nheard the heavy, unvibrant thud of Cazaio's body upon the turf.\n\n\"May he find more mercy than he has merited,\" said John Bulmer, \"for the\nman had excellent traits. Yes, in him the making of a very good swordsman\nwas spoiled by that abominable Boisrobert.\"\n\nBut Claire had caught him by the shoulder. \"Look, Jean!\"\n\nHe turned toward the Duardenez. A troop of horsemen was nearing. Now they\nswept about the curve in the highway and at their head was de Puysange,\nlaughing terribly. The dragoons went by like a tumult in a sick man's\ndream, and the Hugonet Wing had screened them.\n\n\"Then Bellegarde is relieved,\" said John Bulmer, \"and your life, at least,\nis saved.\"\n\nThe girl stormed. \"You--you abominable trickster! You would not be content\nwith the keys of heaven if you had not got them by outwitting somebody! Do\nyou fancy I had never seen the Duke of Ormskirk's portrait? Gaston sent me\none six months ago.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said John Bulmer, very quietly. He took up the discarded scabbard,\nand he sheathed his sword without speaking.\n\nPresently he said, \"You have been cognizant all along that I was the Duke\nof Ormskirk?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered, promptly.\n\n\"And you married me, knowing that I was--God save the mark!--the great Duke\nof Ormskirk? knowing that you made what we must grossly term a brilliant\nmatch?\"\n\n\"I married you because, in spite of Jean Bulmer, you had betrayed yourself\nto be a daring and a gallant gentleman,--and because, for a moment, I\nthought that I did not dislike the Duke of Ormskirk quite so much as I\nought to.\"\n\nHe digested this.\n\n\"O Jean Bulmer,\" the girl said, \"they tell me you were ever a fortunate\nman, but I consider you the unluckiest I know of. For always you are afraid\nto be yourself. Sometimes you forget, and are just you--and then, oh\u00e9! you\nremember, and are only a sulky, fat old gentleman who is not you at all,\nsomehow; so that at times I detest you, and at times I cannot thoroughly\ndetest you. So that I played out the comedy, Jean Bulmer. I meant in the\nend to tell Louis who you were, of course, and not let them hang you; but I\nnever quite trusted you; and I never knew whether I detested you or no, at\nbottom, until last night.\"\n\n\"Last night you left the safe Inner Tower to come to me--to save me at all\nhazards, or else to die with me--And for what reason, did you do this?\"\n\n\"You are bullying me!\" she wailed.\n\n\"And for what reason, did you do this?\" he repeated, without any change of\nintonation.\n\n\"Can you not guess?\" she asked. \"Oh, because I am a fool!\" she stated, very\nhappily, for his arms were about her.\n\n\"Eh, in that event--\" said the Duke of Ormskirk. \"Look!\" said he, with a\ndeeper thrill of speech, \"it is the dawn.\"\n\nThey turned hand in hand; and out of the east the sun came statelily, and a\nnew day was upon them.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nHEART OF GOLD\n\n\n_As Played at Paris, in the May of 1750_\n\n\"_Cette amoureuse ardeur qui dans les coeurs s'excite N'est point, comme\nl'on s\u00e7ait, un effet du merite; Le caprice y prend part, et, quand\nquelqu'un nous plaist, Souvent nous avons peine \u00e0 dire pourquoy c'est. Mais\non vois que l'amour se gouverne autrement._\"\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6\n\nDUC DE PUYSANGE, somewhat given to women, and now and then to\ngood-fellowship, but a man of excellent disposition.\n\nMARQUIS DE SOYECOURT, his cousin, and loves de Puysange's wife.\n\nDUKE OF ORMSKIRK.\n\nDUCHESSE DE PUYSANGE, a precise, but amiable and patient, woman.\n\nANTOINE, LACKEYS to de Puysange, Etc.\n\n\nSCENE\n\nParis, mostly within and about the H\u00f4tel de Puysange.\n\n\n\n\nHEART OF GOLD\n\n\nPROEM:--_Necessitated by a Change of Scene_\n\nYou are not to imagine that John Bulmer debated an exposure of de\nSoyecourt. \"Live and let live\" was the Englishman's axiom; the exuberant\nCazaio was dead, his men were either slain or dispersed, and the whole\ntangle of errors--with judicious reservations--had now been unravelled to\nGaston's satisfaction. And Claire de Puysange was now Duchess of Ormskirk.\nWhy, then, meddle with Destiny, who appeared, after all, to possess a\ncertain sense of equity?\n\nSo Ormskirk smiled as he presently went about Paris, on his own business,\nand when he and Louis de Soyecourt encountered each other their\nfriendliness was monstrous in its geniality.\n\nThey were now one and all in Paris, where Ormskirk's marriage had been\nagain, and more publicly, solemnized. De Puysange swore that his sister was\non this occasion the loveliest person affordable by the resources of the\nuniverse, but de Soyecourt backed another candidate; so that over their\nwine the two gentlemen presently fell into a dispute.\n\n\"Nay, but I protest to you she is the most beautiful woman in all Paris!\"\ncried the Marquis de Soyecourt, and kissed his finger-tips gallantly.\n\n\"My dear Louis,\" the Duc de Puysange retorted, \"her eyes are noticeable,\nperhaps; and I grant you,\" he added, slowly, \"that her husband is not often\ntroubled by--that which they notice.\"\n\n\"--And the cleverest!\"\n\n\"I have admitted she knows when to be silent. What more would you demand of\nany woman?\"\n\n\"And yet--\" The little Marquis waved a reproachful forefinger.\n\n\"Why, but,\" said the Duke, with utter comprehension, \"it is not for nothing\nthat our house traces from the great Jurgen--\"\n\nHe was in a genial midnight mood, and, on other subjects, inclined to be\ngarrulous; for the world, viewed through a slight haze, of vinous origin,\nseemed a pleasant place, and inspired a kindly desire to say diverting\nthings about the world's contents. He knew the Marquis to be patient,\nand even stolid, under a fusillade of epigram and paradox; in short, de\nPuysange knew the hour and the antagonist for midnight talk to be at hand.\nAnd a saturnalia of phrases whirled in his brain, demanding utterance.\n\nHe waved them aside. Certain inbred ideas are strangely tenacious of\nexistence, and it happened to be his wife they were discussing. It would\nnot be good form, de Puysange felt, for him to evince great interest in\nthis topic....\n\n\nI\n\n\"And yet,\" de Puysange queried, as he climbed democratically into a public\nhackney coach, \"why not? For my part, I see no good and sufficient reason\nfor discriminating against the only woman one has sworn to love and cherish\nand honor. It is true that several hundred people witnessed the promise,\nwith a perfect understanding of the jest, and that the keeping of this oath\ninvolves a certain breach of faith with society. Eh bien! let us, then,\ndeceive the world--and the flesh--and the devil! Let us snap our fingers at\nthis unholy trinity, and assert the right, when the whim takes us, to make\nunstinted love to our own wives!\"\n\nHe settled back in the _fiacre_ to deliberate. \"It is bourgeois? Bah! the\nword is the first refuge of the unskilful poseur! It is bourgeois to be\nborn, to breathe, to sleep, or eat; in which of the functions that consume\nthe greater part of my life do I differ from my grocer? Bourgeois! why,\nrightly considered, to be a human being at all is quite inordinately\nbourgeois! And it is very notably grocer-like to maintain a grave face and\ntwo establishments, to chuckle privily over the fragments of the seventh\ncommandment, to repent, upon detection, and afterward--ces b\u00eates-l\u00e0!--to\ndrink poison. Ma foi, I infinitely prefer the domestic coffee!\"\n\nThe Duc de Puysange laughed, and made as though to wave aside the crudities\nof life. \"All vice is bourgeois, and fornication in particular tends\nto become sordid, outworn, vieux jeu! In youth, I grant you, it is the\nunexpurgated that always happens. But at my age--misericorde!--the\nmen yawn, and les demoiselles--bah! les demoiselles have the souls of\naccountants! They buy and sell, as my grocer does. The satiation of carnal\ndesires is no longer a matter of splendid crimes and sorrows and kingdoms\nlost; it is a matter of business.\"\n\nThe harsh and swarthy face relaxed. With, a little sigh the Duc de Puysange\nhad closed his fevered eyes. About them were a multitude of tiny lines,\nand of this fact he was obscurely conscious, in a wearied fashion, when he\nagain looked out on the wellnigh deserted streets, now troubled by a hint\nof dawn. His eyes were old; they had seen much. Two workmen shambled by,\nchatting on their way to the day's work; in the attic yonder a drunken\nfellow sang, \"Ah, bouteille ma mie,\" he bellowed, \"pourquoi vous\nvuidez-vous?\"\n\nDe Puysange laughed. \"I suppose I have no conscience, but at least, I can\nlay claim to a certain fastidiousness. I am very wicked,\"--he smiled,\nwithout mirth or bitterness,--\"I have sinned notably as the world accounts\nit; indeed, I think, my repute is as abominable as that of any man living.\nAnd I am tired,--alas, I am damnably tired! I have found the seven deadly\nsins deadly, beyond, doubt, but only deadly dull and deadly commonplace. I\nhave perseveringly frisked in the high places of iniquity, I have junketed\nwith all evil gods, and the utmost they could pretend to offer any of their\nservitors was a spasm. I renounce them, as feeble-minded deities, I snap\nmy fingers, very much as did my progenitor, the great Jurgen, at all their\nover-rated mysteries.\"\n\nHis glance caught and clung for a moment to the paling splendor of the moon\nthat hung low in the vacant, dove-colored heavens. A faint pang, half-envy,\nhalf-regret, vexed the Duke with a dull twinge. \"I wish too that by living\ncontinently I could have done, once for all, with this faded pose and this\nidle making of phrases! Eheu! there is a certain proverb concerning pitch\nso cynical that I suspect it of being truthful. However,--we shall see.\"\n\nDe Puysange smiled. \"The most beautiful woman in all Paris? Ah, yes, she is\nquite that, is this grave silent female whose eyes are more fathomless and\ncold than oceans! And how cordially she despises me! Ma foi, I think that\nif her blood--which is, beyond doubt, of a pale-pink color,--be ever\nstirred, at all, it is with loathing of her husband. Well, life holds many\nsurprises for madame, now that I become quite as virtuous as she is. We\nwill arrange a very pleasant comedy of belated courtship; for are we not\nbidden to love one another? So be it,--I am henceforth the model p\u00e8re de\nfamille.\"\n\nNow the _fiacre_ clattered before the H\u00f4tel de Puysange.\n\nThe door was opened by a dull-eyed lackey, whom de Puysange greeted with\na smile, \"Bon jour, Antoine!\" cried the Duke; \"I trust that your wife and\ndoubtless very charming children have good health?\"\n\n\"Beyond question, monseigneur,\" the man answered, stolidly.\n\n\"That is excellent hearing,\" de Puysange said, \"and it rejoices me to be\nreassured of their welfare. For the happiness of others, Antoine, is\nvery dear to the heart of a father--and of a husband.\" The Duke chuckled\nseraphically as he passed down the hall. The man stared after him, and\nshrugged.\n\n\"Rather worse than usual,\" Antoine considered.\n\n\nII\n\nNext morning the Duchesse de Puysange received an immoderate armful of\nroses, with a fair copy of some execrable verses. De Puysange spent the\nafternoon, selecting bonbons and wholesome books,--\"for his fianc\u00e9e,\" he\ngravely informed the shopman.\n\nAt the Op\u00e9ra he never left her box; afterward, at the Comtesse de\nHauteville's, he created a furor by sitting out three dances in the\nconservatory with his wife. Mademoiselle Tiercelin had already received his\nregrets that he was spending that night at home.\n\n\nIII\n\nThe month wore on.\n\n\"It is the true honeymoon,\" said the Duke.\n\nIn that event he might easily have found a quieter place than Paris wherein\nto spend it. Police agents had of late been promised a premium for any\nsturdy beggar, whether male or female, they could secure to populate\nthe new plantation of Louisiana; and as the premium was large, genteel\nburgesses, and in particular the children of genteel burgesses, were\npresently disappearing in a fashion their families found annoying. Now,\nfrom nowhere, arose and spread the curious rumor that King Louis, somewhat\nthe worse for his diversions in the Parc-aux-Cerfs, daily restored his\nvigor by bathing in the blood of young children; and parents of the\nabsentees began to manifest a double dissatisfaction, for the deduction was\nobvious.\n\nThere were riots. In one of them Madame de Pompadour barely escaped with\nher life, [Footnote: This was on the afternoon of the famous ball given\nby the Pompadour in honor of the new Duchess of Ormskirk.] and the King\nhimself on his way to Compi\u00e8gne, was turned back at the Porte St. Antoine,\nand forced to make a d\u00e9tour rather than enter his own capital. After this\naffair de Puysange went straight to his brother-in-law.\n\n\"Jean,\" said he, \"for a newly married man you receive too much company. And\nafterward your visitors talk blasphemously in cabarets and shoot the King's\nmusketeers. I would appreciate an explanation.\"\n\nOrmskirk shrugged. \"Merely a makeshift, Gaston. Merely a device to gain\ntime wherein England may prepare against the alliance of France and\nAustria. Your secret treaty will never be signed as long as Paris is given\nover to rioters. Nay, the Empress may well hesitate to ally herself with\na king who thus clamantly cannot govern even his own realm. And meanwhile\nEngland will prepare herself. We will be ready to fight you in five years,\nbut we do not intend to be hurried about it.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" de Puysange assented;--\"yet you err in sending Cumberland to defend\nHanover. You will need a better man there.\"\n\nOrmskirk slapped his thigh. \"So you intercepted that last despatch, after\nall! And I could have sworn Candale was trustworthy!\"\n\n\"My adored Jean,\" replied de Puysange, \"he has been in my pay for six\nmonths! Console yourself with the reflection that you overbid us in\nNoumaria.\"\n\n\"Yes, but old Ludwig held out for more than the whole duchy is worth. We\npaid of course. We had to pay.\"\n\n\"And one of course congratulates you upon securing the quite essential\nsupport of that duchy. Still, Jean, if there were any accident--\" De\nPuysange was really unbelievably ugly when he smiled. \"For accidents do\noccur.... It is war, then?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" said Ormskirk, \"of course it is war. We are about to fly\nat each other's throats, with half of Europe to back each of us. We begin\nthe greatest game we have ever played. And we will manage it very badly, I\ndare say, since we are each of us just now besotted with adoration of our\nwives.\"\n\n\"At times,\" said de Puysange, with dignity, \"your galimatias are\ninsufferable. Now let us talk like reasonable beings. In regard to\nPomerania, you will readily understand that the interests of humanity--\"\n\n\nIV\n\nStill the suggestion haunted him. It would be a nuance too ridiculous, of\ncourse, to care seriously for one's wife, and yet H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Puysange\nwas undeniably a handsome woman. As they sat over the remains of their\ndinner,--_\u00e0 deux_, by the Duke's request,--she seemed to her husband quite\nincredibly beautiful. She exhaled the effects of a water-color in discreet\nand delicate tinctures. Lithe and fine and proud she was to the merest\nglance; yet patience, a thought conscious of itself, beaconed in her eyes,\nand she appeared, with urbanity, to regard life as, upon the whole, a\ncountrified performance. De Puysange liked that air; he liked the reticence\nof every glance and speech and gesture,--liked, above all, the thinnish\noval of her face and the staid splendor of her hair. Here was no vulgar\nyellow, no crass and hackneyed gold ... and yet there was a clarified and\ngauzier shade of gold ... the color of the moon by daylight, say.... Then,\nas the pleasures of digestion lapsed gently into the initial amenities of\nsleep, she spoke.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said she, \"will you be pleased to tell me the meaning of this\ncomedy?\"\n\n\"Madame,\" de Puysange answered, and raised his gloomy eyebrows, \"I do not\nentirely comprehend.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said she, \"believe me, I do not undervalue your perception. I have\nalways esteemed your cleverness, monsieur, however much\"--she paused for\na moment, a fluctuating smile upon her lips,--\"however much I may have\nregretted its manifestations. I am not clever, and to me cleverness has\nalways seemed to be an infinite incapacity for hard work; its results\nare usually a few sonnets, an undesirable wife, and a warning for one's\nacquaintances. In your case it is, of course, different; you have your\nstatesmanship to play with--\"\n\n\"And statesmen have no need of cleverness, you would imply, madame?\"\n\n\"I do not say that. In any event, you are the Duc de Puysange, and the\nweight of a great name stifles stupidity and cleverness without any\npartiality. With you, cleverness has taken the form of a tendency to\nintoxication, amours, and--amiability. I have acquiesced in this. But, for\nthe past month--\"\n\n\"The happiest period of my life!\" breathed the Duke.\n\n\"--you have been pleased to present me with flowers, bonbons, jewels, and\nwhat not. You have actually accorded your wife the courtesies you usually\npreserve for the ladies of the ballet. You have dogged my footsteps, you\nhave attempted to intrude into my bedroom, you have talked to me as--well,\nvery much as--\"\n\n\"Much as the others do?\" de Puysange queried, helpfully. \"Pardon me,\nmadame, but, in one's own husband, I had thought this very routine might\nsavor of originality.\"\n\nThe Duchess flushed, \"All the world knows, monsieur, that in your\nestimation what men have said to me, or I to them, has been for fifteen\nyears a matter of no moment! It is not due to you that I am still--\"\n\n\"A pearl,\" finished the Duke, gallantly,--then touched himself upon the\nchest,--\"cast before swine,\" he sighed.\n\nShe rose to her feet. \"Yes, cast before swine!\" she cried, with a quick\nlift of speech. She seemed very tall as she stood tapping her fingers upon\nthe table, irresolutely; but after an instant she laughed and spread out\nher fine hands in an impotent gesture. \"Ah, monsieur,\" she said, \"my father\nentrusted to your keeping a clean-minded girl! What have you made of her,\nGaston?\"\n\nA strange and profoundly unreasonable happiness swept through the Duke's\nsoul as she spoke his given name for the first time within his memory.\nSurely, the deep contralto voice had lingered over it?--half-tenderly,\nhalf-caressingly, one might think.\n\nThe Duke put aside his coffee-cup and, rising, took his wife's soft hands\nin his. \"What have I made of her? I have made of her, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, the one\nobject of all my desires.\"\n\nHer face flushed. \"Mountebank!\" she cried, and struggled to free herself;\n\"do you mistake me, then, for a raddle-faced actress in a barn? Ah, les\ndemoiselles have formed you, monsieur,--they have formed you well!\"\n\n\"Pardon!\" said the Duke. He released her hands, he swept back his hair with\na gesture of impatience. He turned from his wife, and strolled toward a\nwindow, where, for a little, he tapped upon the pane, his murky countenance\ntwitching oddly, as he stared into the quiet and sunlit street. \"Madame,\"\nhe began, in a level voice, \"I will tell you the meaning of the comedy. To\nme,--always, as you know, a creature of whims,--there came, a month ago, a\nnew whim which I thought attractive, unconventional, promising. It was to\nmake love to my own wife rather than to another man's. Ah, I grant you, it\nis incredible,\" he cried, when the Duchess raised her hand as though to\nspeak,--\"incredible, fantastic, and ungentlemanly! So be it; nevertheless,\nI have played out my r\u00f4le. I have been the model husband; I have put away\nwine and--les demoiselles; for it pleased me, in my petty insolence, to\npatronize, rather than to defy, the laws of God and man. Your perfection\nirritated me, madame; it pleased me to demonstrate how easy is this trick\nof treating the world as the antechamber of a future existence. It pleased\nme to have in my life one space, however short, over which neither the\nRecording Angel nor even you might draw a long countenance. It pleased me,\nin effect, to play out the comedy, smug-faced and immaculate,--for the\ntime. I concede that I have failed in my part. Hiss me from the stage,\nmadame; add one more insult to the already considerable list of those\naffronts which I have put upon you; one more will scarcely matter.\"\n\nShe faced him with set lips. \"So, monsieur, your boasted comedy amounts\nonly to this?\"\n\n\"I am not sure of its meaning, madame. I think that, perhaps, the swine,\nwallowing in the mire which they have neither strength nor will to leave,\nmay yet, at times, long--and long whole-heartedly--\" De Puysange snapped\nhis fingers. \"Peste!\" said he, \"let us now have done with this dreary\ncomedy! Beyond doubt de Soyecourt has much to answer for, in those idle\nwords which were its germ. Let us hiss both collaborators, madame.\"\n\n\"De Soyecourt!\" she marveled, with, a little start. \"Was it he who prompted\nyou to make love to me?\"\n\n\"Without intention,\" pleaded the Duke. \"He twitted me for my inability, as\nyour husband, to gain your affections; but I do not question his finest\nsensibilities would be outraged by our disastrous revival of Philemon and\nBaucis.\"\n\n\"Ah--!\" said she. She was smiling at some reflection or other.\n\nThere was a pause. The Duc de Puysange drummed upon the window-pane; the\nDuchess, still faintly smiling, trifled with the thin gold chain that hung\nabout her neck. Both knew their display of emotion to have been somewhat\nunmodern, not entirely _\u00e0 la mode_.\n\n\"Decidedly,\" spoke de Puysange, and turned toward her with a slight\ngrimace, \"I am no longer fit to play the lover; yet a little while, madame,\nand you must stir my gruel-posset, and arrange the pillows more comfortably\nabout the octogenarian.\"\n\n\"Ah, Gaston,\" she answered, and in protest raised her slender fingers, \"let\nus have no more heroics. We are not well fitted for them, you and I.\"\n\n\"So it would appear,\" the Duc de Puysange conceded, not without sulkiness.\n\n\"Let us be friends,\" she pleaded. \"Remember, it was fifteen years ago I\nmade the grave mistake of marrying a very charming man--\"\n\n\"Merci!\" cried the Duke.\n\n\"--and I did not know that I was thereby denying myself the pleasure of his\nacquaintance. I have learned too late that marrying a man is only the most\ncivil way of striking him from one's visiting-list.\" The Duchess hesitated.\n\"Frankly, Gaston, I do not regret the past month.\"\n\n\"It has been adorable!\" sighed the Duke.\n\n\"Yes,\" she admitted; \"except those awkward moments when you would insist on\nmaking love to me.\"\n\n\"But no, madame,\" cried he, \"it was precisely--\"\n\n\"O my husband, my husband!\" she interrupted, with a shrug of the shoulders;\n\"why, you do it so badly!\"\n\nThe Duc de Puysange took a short turn about the apartment. \"Yet I married\nyou,\" said he, \"at sixteen--out of a convent!\"\n\n\"Mon ami,\" she murmured, in apology, \"am I not to be frank with you? Would\nyou have only the connubial confidences?\"\n\n\"But I had no idea--\" he began.\n\n\"Why, Gaston, it bored me to the very verge of yawning in my lover's\ncountenance. I, too, had no idea but that it would bore you equally--\"\n\n\"Hein?\" said the Duke.\n\n\"--to hear what d'Humi\u00e8res--\"\n\n\"He squints!\" cried the Duc de Puysange.\n\n\"--or de Cr\u00e9quy--\"\n\n\"That red-haired ape!\" he muttered.\n\n\"--or d'Arlanges, or--or any of them, was pleased to say. In fact, it was\nmy duty to conceal from my husband anything which might involve him in\nduels. Now that we are friends, of course it is entirely different.\"\n\nThe Duchess smiled; the Duke walked up and down the room with the contained\nferocity of a caged tiger.\n\n\"In duels! in a whole series of duels! So these seducers besiege you\nin platoons. Ma foi, friendship is a good oculist! Already my vision\nimproves.\"\n\n\"Gaston!\" she cried. The Duchess rose and laid both hands upon his\nshoulders. \"Gaston--?\" she repeated.\n\nFor a heart-beat the Duc de Puysange looked into his wife's eyes; then he\nsadly smiled and shook his head. \"Madame,\" said the Duke, \"I do not doubt\nyou. Ah, believe me, I have comprehended, always, that in your keeping my\nhonor was quite safe--far more safe than in mine, as Heaven and most of the\nfiends well know. You have been a true and faithful wife to a worthless\nbrute who has not deserved it.\" He lifted her fingers to his lips. De\nPuysange stood very erect; his heels clicked together, and his voice was\nearnest. \"I thank you, madame, and I pray you to believe that I have never\ndoubted you. You are too perfect to err--Frankly, and between friends.\"\nadded the Duke, \"it was your cold perfection which frightened me. You are\nan icicle, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne.\"\n\nShe was silent for a moment. \"Ah!\" she said, and sighed; \"you think so?\"\n\n\"Once, then--?\" The Duc de Puysange seated himself beside his wife, and\ntook her hand.\n\n\"I--it was nothing.\" Her lashes fell, and dull color flushed through her\ncountenance.\n\n\"Between friends,\" the Duke suggested, \"there should be no reservations.\"\n\n\"But it is such a pitiably inartistic little history!\" the Duchess\nprotested. \"Eh bien, if you must have it! For I was a girl once,--an\ninnocent girl, as given as are most girls to long reveries and bright,\ncallow day-dreams. And there was a man--\"\n\n\"There always is,\" said the Duke, darkly.\n\n\"Why, he never even knew, mon ami!\" cried his wife, and laughed, and\nclapped her hands. \"He was much older than I; there were stories about\nhim--oh, a great many stories,--and one hears even in a convent--\" She\npaused with a reminiscent smile. \"And I used to wonder shyly what this\nvery fearful reprobate might be like. I thought of him with de Lauzun,\nand Dom Juan, and with the Duc de Grammont, and all those other scented,\nshimmering, magnificent libertines over whom les ing\u00e9nues--wonder; only, I\nthought of him, more often than of the others, I made little prayers for\nhim to the Virgin. And I procured a tiny miniature of him. And, when I came\nout of the convent, I met him at my father's house. [Footnote: She was of\nthe Aigullon family, and sister to d'Agenois, the first and very politic\nlover of Madame de la Tournelle, afterward mistress to Louis Quinze under\nthe title of Duchesse de Ch\u00e2teauroux. The later relations between the\nd'Aigullons and Madame du Barry are well-known.] And that was all.\"\n\n\"All?\" The Duc de Puysange had raised his swart eyebrows, and he slightly\nsmiled.\n\n\"All,\" she re-echoed, firmly. \"Oh, I assure you he was still too youthful\nto have any time to devote to young girls. He was courteous--no more. But I\nkept the picture,--ah, girls are so foolish, Gaston!\" The Duchess, with a\nlight laugh, drew upward the thin chain about her neck. At its end was a\nlittle heart-shaped locket of dull gold, with a diamond sunk deep in each\nside. She regarded the locket with a quaint sadness. \"It is a long while\nsince I have seen that miniature, for it has been sealed in here,\" said\nshe, \"ever since--since some one gave me the locket\"\n\nNow the Duc de Puysange took this trinket, still tepid and perfumed from\ncontact with her flesh. He turned it awkwardly in his hand, his eyes\nflashing volumes of wonderment and inquiry. Yet he did not appear jealous,\nnor excessively unhappy. \"And never,\" he demanded, some vital emotion\ncatching at his voice--\"never since then--?\"\n\n\"I never, of course, approved of him,\" she answered; and at this point de\nPuysange noted--so near as he could remember for the first time in his\nexistence,--the curve of her trailing lashes. Why but his wife had lovely\neyelashes, lashes so unusual that he drew nearer to observe them more at\nhis ease. \"Still,--I hardly know how to tell you--still, without him the\nworld was more quiet, less colorful; it held, appreciably, less to catch\nthe eye and ear. Eh, he had an air, Gaston; he was never an admirable man,\nbut, somehow, he was invariably the centre of the picture.\"\n\n\"And you have always--always you have cared for him?\" said the Duke,\ndrawing nearer and yet more near to her.\n\n\"Other men,\" she murmured, \"seem futile and of minor importance, after\nhim.\" The lashes lifted. They fell, promptly. \"So, I have always kept the\nheart, mon ami. And, yes, I have always loved him, I suppose.\"\n\nThe chain had moved and quivered in his hand. Was it man or woman who\ntrembled? wondered the Duc de Puysange. For a moment he stood immovable,\nevery nerve in his body tense. Surely, it was she who trembled? It seemed\nto him that this woman, whose cold perfection had galled him so long, now\nstood with downcast eyes, and blushed and trembled, too, like any rustic\nmaiden come shamefaced to her first tryst.\n\n\"H\u00e9l\u00e8ne--!\" he cried.\n\n\"But no, my story is too dull,\" she protested, and shrugged her shoulders,\nand disengaged herself--half-fearfully, it seemed to her husband. \"Even\nmore insipid than your comedy,\" she added, with a not unkindly smile. \"Do\nwe drive this afternoon?\"\n\n\"In effect, yes!\" cried the Duke. He paused and laughed--a low and gentle\nlaugh, pulsing with unutterable content. \"Since this afternoon, madame--\"\n\n\"Is cloudless?\" she queried.\n\n\"Nay, far more than that,\" de Puysange amended; \"it is refulgent.\"\n\n\nV\n\nWhat time the Duchess prepared her person for the drive the Duke walked\nin the garden of the H\u00f4tel de Puysange. Up and down a shady avenue of\nlime-trees he paced, and chuckled to himself, and smiled benignantly upon\nthe moss-incrusted statues,--a proceeding that was, beyond any reasonable\ndoubt, prompted by his happiness rather than by the artistic merits of\nthe postured images, since they constituted a formidable and broken-nosed\ncollection of the most cumbrous, the most incredible, and the most hideous\ninstances of sculpture the family of Puysange had been able to accumulate\nfor, as the phrase is, love or money. Amid these mute, gray travesties of\nantiquity and the tastes of his ancestors, the Duc de Puysange exulted.\n\n\"Ma foi, will life never learn to improve upon the extravagancies of\nromance? Why, it is the old story,--the hackneyed story of the husband and\nwife who fall in love with each other! Life is a very gross plagiarist. And\nshe--did she think I had forgotten how I gave her that little locket so\nlong ago? Eh, ma femme, so 'some one'--'some one' who cannot be alluded to\nwithout a pause and an adorable flush--presented you with your locket! Nay,\nlove is not always blind!\"\n\nThe Duke paused before a puff-jawed Triton, who wallowed in an arid basin\nand uplifted toward heaven what an indulgent observer might construe as a\nbroken conch-shell. \"Love! Mon Dieu, how are the superior fallen! I have\nnot the decency to conceal even from myself that I love my wife! I am\nshameless, I had as lief proclaim it from the house-tops. And a month\nago--tarare, the ignorant beast I was! Moreover, at that time I had not\npassed a month in her company,--eh bien, I defy Diogenes and Timon to come\nthrough such a testing with unscratched hearts. I love her. And she loves\nme!\"\n\nHe drew a deep breath, and he lifted his comely hands toward the pale\nspring sky, where the west wind was shepherding a sluggish flock of clouds.\n\"O sun, moon, and stars!\" de Puysange said, aloud: \"I call you to witness\nthat she loves me! Always she has loved me! O kindly little universe! O\nlittle kings, tricked out with garish crowns and sceptres, you are masters\nof your petty kingdoms, but I am master of her heart!\n\n\"I do not deserve it,\" he conceded, to a dilapidated faun, who, though his\nflute and the hands that held it had been missing for over a quarter of\na century, piped, on with unimpaired and fatuous mirth. \"Ah, heart of\ngold--demented trinket that you are, I have not merited that you should\nretain my likeness all these years! If I had my deserts--parbleu! let us\naccept such benefits as the gods provide, and not question the wisdom\nof their dispensations. What man of forty-three may dare to ask for his\ndeserts? No, we prefer instead the dealings of blind chance and all the\ngross injustices by which so many of us escape hanging\"....\n\n\nVI\n\n\"So madame has visitors? Eh bien, let us, then, behold these naughty\nvisitors, who would sever a husband from his wife!\"\n\nFrom within the Red Salon came a murmur of speech,--quiet, cordial,\ncolorless,--which showed very plainly that madame had visitors. As the Duc\nde Puysange reached out his hand to draw aside the porti\u00e8res, her voice was\nspeaking, courteously, but without vital interest.\n\n\"--and afterward,\" said she, \"weather permitting--\"\n\n\"Ah, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne!\" cried a voice that the Duke knew almost as well, \"how long am\nI to be held at arm's-length by these petty conventionalities? Is candor\nnever to be permitted?\"\n\nThe half-drawn porti\u00e8re trembled in the Duke's grasp. He could see, from\nwhere he stood, the inmates of the salon, though their backs were turned.\nThey were his wife and the Marquis de Soyecourt. The Marquis bent eagerly\ntoward the Duchesse de Puysange, who had risen as he spoke.\n\nFor a moment she stayed as motionless as her perplexed husband; then,\nwith a wearied sigh, the Duchess sank back into a _fauteuil_. \"You are at\nliberty to speak,\" she said, slowly, and with averted glance--\"what you\nchoose.\"\n\nThe porti\u00e8re fell; but between its folds the Duke still peered into the\nroom, where de Soyecourt had drawn nearer to the Duke's wife. \"There is\nso little to say,\" the Marquis murmured, \"beyond what my eyes have surely\nrevealed a great while ago--that I love you.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" the Duchess cried, with a swift intaking of the breath which was\nalmost a sob. \"Monsieur, I think you forget that you are speaking to the\nwife of your kinsman and your friend.\"\n\nThe Marquis threw out his hands in a gesture which was theatrical, though\nthe trouble that wrung his countenance seemed very real. He was, as one has\nsaid, a slight, fair man, with the face of an ecclesiastic and the eyes of\nan aging seraph. A dull pang shot through the Duke as he thought of the two\nyears' difference in their ages, and of his own tendency to embonpoint, and\nof the dismal features which calumniated him. Yonder porcelain fellow was\nin appearance so incredibly young!\n\n\"Do you consider,\" said the Marquis, \"that I do not know I act an\nabominable part? Honor, friendship and even decency!--ah, I regret their\nsacrifice, but love is greater than these petty things!\"\n\nThe Duchess sighed. \"For my part,\" she returned, \"I think differently.\nLove is, doubtless, very wonderful and beautiful, but I am sufficiently\nold-fashioned to hold honor yet dearer. Even--even if I loved you,\nmonsieur, there are certain promises, sworn before the altar, that I could\nnot forget.\" She looked up, candidly, into the flushed, handsome face of\nthe Marquis.\n\n\"Words!\" he cried, with vexed impatiency.\n\n\"An oath,\" she answered, sadly,--\"an oath that I may not break.\"\n\nThere was hunger in the Marquis' eyes, and his hands lifted. Their glances\nmet for a breathless moment, and his eyes were tender, and her eyes were\nresolute, but very, very compassionate.\n\n\"I love you!\" he said. He said no more than this, but none could doubt he\nspoke the truth.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" the Duchess replied, and the depths of her contralto voice were\nshaken like the sobbing of a violin, and her hands stole upward to her\nbosom, and clasped the gold heart, as she spoke,--\"monsieur, ever since I\nfirst knew you, many years ago, at my father's home, I have held you as my\nfriend. You were more kind to the girl, Monsieur de Soyecourt, than you\nhave been to the woman. Yet only since our stay in Poictesme yonder have\nI feared for the result of our friendship. I have tried to prevent this\nresult. I have failed.\" The Duchess lifted the gold heart to her lips, and\nher golden head bent over it. \"Monsieur, before God, if I had loved you\nwith my whole being,--if I had loved you all these years,--if the sight of\nyour face were to me to-day the one good thing life holds, and the mere\nsound of your voice had power to set my heart to beating--beating\"--she\npaused for a little, and then rose, with a sharp breath that shook her\nslender body visibly,--\"even then, my Louis, the answer would be the same;\nand that is,--go!\"\n\n\"H\u00e9l\u00e8ne--!\" he murmured; and his outstretched hands, which trembled, groped\ntoward her.\n\n\"Let us have no misunderstanding,\" she protested, more composedly; \"you\nhave my answer.\"\n\nDe Soyecourt did not, at mildest, lead an immaculate life. But by\nthe passion that now possessed him the tiny man seemed purified and\ntransfigured beyond masculinity. His face was ascetic in its reverence as\nhe waited there, with his head slightly bowed. \"I go,\" he said, at last, as\nif picking his way carefully among tumbling words; then bent over her hand,\nwhich, she made no effort to withdraw. \"Ah, my dear!\" cried the Marquis,\nstaring into her shy, uplifted eyes, \"I think I might have made you happy!\"\n\nHis arm brushed the elbow of the Duke as de Soyecourt left the salon. The\nMarquis seemed aware of nothing: the misery of both the men, as de Puysange\nreflected, was of a sort to be disturbed by nothing less noticeable than an\nearthquake.\n\n\nVII\n\n\"If I had loved you all these years,\" murmured the Duc de Puysange. His\ndull gaze wandered toward the admirable \"Herodias\" of Giorgione which hung\nthere in the corridor: the strained face of the woman, the accented muscles\nof her arms, the purple, bellying cloak which spread behind her, the livid\ncountenance of the dead man staring up from the salver,--all these he\nnoted, idly. It seemed strange that he should be appraising a painting at\nthis particular moment.\n\n\"Well, now I will make recompense,\" said the Duke.\n\n\nVIII\n\nHe came into the room, humming a tune of the boulevards; the crimson\nhangings swirled about him, the furniture swayed in aerial and thin-legged\nminuets. He sank into a chair before the great mirror, supported by frail\nlove-gods, who contended for its possession. He viewed therein his pale and\ngrotesque reflection, and he laughed lightly. \"Pardon, madame,\" he said,\n\"but my castles in the air are tumbling noisily about my ears. It is\ndifficult to think clearly amid the crashing of the battlements.\"\n\n\"I do not understand.\" The Duchess had lifted a rather grave and quite\nincurious face as he entered the salon.\n\n\"My life,\" laughed the Duc de Puysange, \"I assure you I am quite\nincorrigible. I have just committed another abominable action; and I cry\n_peccavi!_\" He smote himself upon the breast, and sighed portentously. \"I\naccuse myself of eavesdropping.\"\n\n\"What is your meaning?\" She had now risen to her feet.\n\n\"Nay, but I am requited,\" the Duke reassured her, and laughed with\ndiscreetly tempered bitterness. \"Figure to yourself, madame! I had\nplanned for us a life during which our new-born friendship was always to\nendure untarnished. Eh bien, man proposes! De Soyecourt is of a jealous\ndisposition; and here I sit, amid my fallen aircastles, like that tiresome\nMarius in his Carthaginian d\u00e9bris.\"\n\n\"De Soyecourt?\" she echoed, dully.\n\n\"Ah, my poor child!\" said the Duke and, rising, took her hand in a paternal\nfashion, \"did you think that, at this late day, the disease of matrimony\nwas still incurable? Nay, we progress, madame. You shall have grounds for a\nseparation--sufficient, unimpeachable grounds. You shall have your choice\nof desertion, infidelity, cruelty in the presence of witnesses--oh, I shall\nprove a yeritabie Gilles de Retz!\" He laughed, not unkindlily, at her\nbewilderment.\n\n\"You heard everything?\" she queried.\n\n\"I have already confessed,\" the Duke reminded her. \"And speaking as an\nunprejudiced observer, I would say the little man really loves you. So be\nit! You shall have your separation, you shall marry him in all honor and\nrespectability; and if everything goes well, you shall be a grand duchess\none of these days--Behold a fact accomplished!\" De Puysange snapped his\nfingers and made a pirouette; he began to hum, \"Songez de bonne \u00e0 suivre--\"\n\nThere was a little pause.\n\n\"You, in truth, desire to restore to me my freedom?\" she asked, in wonder,\nand drew near to him.\n\nThe Duc de Puysange seated himself, with a smile. \"Mon Dieu!\" he protested,\n\"who am I to keep lovers apart? As the first proof of our new-sworn\nfriendship, I hereby offer you any form of abuse or of maltreatment you may\nselect.\"\n\nShe drew yet nearer to him. Afterward, with a sigh as if of great\nhappiness, her arms clasped about his neck. \"Mountebank! do you, then, love\nme very much?\"\n\n\"I?\" The Duke raised his eyebrows. Yet, he reflected, there was really no\nespecial harm in drawing his cheek a trifle closer to hers, and he found\nthe contact to be that of cool velvet.\n\n\"You love me!\" she repeated, softly.\n\n\"It pains me to the heart,\" the Duke apologized--\"it pains me, pith and\ncore, to be guilty of this rudeness to a lady; but, after all, honesty is\na proverbially recommended virtue, and so I must unblushingly admit I do\nnothing of the sort.\"\n\n\"Gaston, why will you not confess to your new friend? Have I not pardoned\nother amorous follies?\" Her cheeks were warmer now, and softer than those\nof any other woman in the world.\n\n\"Eh, ma mie,\" cried the Duke, warningly, \"do not be unduly elated by little\nLouis' avowal! You are a very charming person, but--'_de gustibus_--'\"\n\n\"Gaston--!\" she murmured.\n\n\"Ah, what is one to do with such a woman!\" De Puysange put her from him,\nand he paced the room with quick, unequal strides.\n\n\"Yes, I love you with every nerve and fibre of my body--with every not\nunworthy thought and aspiration of my misguided soul! There you have the\nridiculous truth of it, the truth which makes me the laughing-stock of\nwell bred persons for all time. I adore you. I love you, I cherish you\nsufficiently to resign you to the man your heart has chosen. I--But pardon\nme,\"--and he swept a white hand over his brow, with a little, choking\nlaugh,--\"since I find this new emotion somewhat boisterous. It stifles one\nunused to it.\"\n\nShe faced him, inscrutably; but her eyes were deep wells of gladness.\n\"Monsieur,\" she said, \"yours is a noble affection. I will not palter with\nit, I accept your offer--\"\n\n\"Madame, you act with your usual wisdom,\" said the Duke.\n\n\"--Upon condition,\" she continued,--\"that you resume your position as\neavesdropper.\"\n\nThe Duke obeyed her pointing finger. When he had reached the porti\u00e8res,\nthe proud, black-visaged man looked back into the salon, wearily. She had\nseated herself in the _fauteuil_, where the Marquis de Soyecourt had bent\nover her and she had kissed the little gold locket. Her back was turned\ntoward, her husband; but their eyes met in the great mirror, supported by\nfrail love-gods, who contended for its possession.\n\n\"Comedy for comedy,\" she murmured. He wondered what purblind fool had\ncalled her eyes sea-cold?\n\n\"I do not understand,\" he said. \"You saw me all the while--Yes, but the\nlocket--?\" cried de Puysange.\n\n\"Open it!\" she answered, and her speech, too, was breathless.\n\nUnder his heel the Duc de Puysange ground the trinket. The long, thin chain\nclashed and caught about his foot; the face of his youth smiled from the\nfragment in his not quite steady hands. \"O heart' of gold! O heart of\ngold!\" he said, with, a strange meditative smile, now that his eyes lifted\ntoward the glad and glorious eyes of his wife; \"I am not worthy! Indeed, my\ndear, I am not worthy!\"\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nTHE SCAPEGOATS\n\n\n_As Played at Manneville, September 18, 1750_\n\n\"_L'on a choisi justement le temps que je parlois \u00e0 mon traiste de fils.\nSortons! Je veux aller querir la justice, et faire donner la question \u00e0\ntoute ma maison; \u00e0 servantes, \u00e0 valets, \u00e0 fils, \u00e0 fille, et \u00e0 moi aussi._\"\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6\n\nPRINCE DE GATINAIS, an old nobleman, who affects yesterday's fashion.\n\nLouis QUILLAN, formerly LOUIS DE SOYECOURT, son to the Prince, and newly\nbecome GRAND DUKE OF NOUMARIA.\n\nVANRINGHAM, valet to the Prince.\n\nNELCHEN THORN, daughter to Hans Thorn, landlord of the _Golden\nPomegranate_, and loves Louis Quillan.\n\nAnd In the Proem, DUKE OF OSMSKIRK.\n\n\nSCENE\n\nThe Dolphin Room of the _Golden Pomegranate_, an inn at\nManneville-en-Poictesme.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SCAPEGOATS\n\n\n_PROEM:-To Present Mr. Vanringham as Nuntius_\n\nHowever profoundly the Duc de Puysange now approved of the universe and of\nits management, it is not to be supposed that in consequence he intended\nto overlook de Soyecourt's perfidy. De Puysange bore his kinsman no\nmalice; indeed, he was sincerely fond of the Marquis, sympathized with\nhim at bottom, and heartily regretted that the excellence of poor Louis'\ntaste should be thus demonstrably counterbalanced by the frailty of his\nfriendship. Still, one cannot entirely disregard the conventions: Louis had\nbetrayed him, had before the eyes of de Puysange made love to de Puysange's\nwife. A duel was the inevitable consequence, though of course the Duke did\nnot intend to kill poor Louis, who might before long be very useful to\nFrench statesmanship. So the Duke sent Ormskirk to arrange a meeting.\n\nA floridly handsome man in black was descending the stairway of the H\u00f4tel\nde Soyecourt at the moment the Duke of Ormskirk stepped cheerily from his\ncoach. This person saluted the plump nobleman with due deference, and was\naccorded in return a little whistling sound of amazement.\n\n\"Mr. Vanringham, as I live--and in Paris! Man, will you hare-brained\nJacobites never have done with these idiotic intrigues? Nay, in sincerity,\nMr. Vanringham, this is annoying.\"\n\n\"My Lord Duke,\" said the other, \"I venture to suggest that you forget\nI dare no longer meddle with politics, in light of my recent mishap at\nTunbridge. Something of the truth leaked out, you comprehend--nothing\nprovable, thank God!--but while I lay abed Captain Audaine was calling\ndaily to inquire when would my wound be healed sufficiently for me to have\nmy throat cut. I found England unsalubrious, and vanished.\"\n\nOrmskirk nodded his approval. \"I have always esteemed your common-sense.\nNow, let us consider--yes, I might use you here in Paris, I believe. And\nthe work is light and safe,--a trifle of sedition, of stirring up a street\nriot or two.\"\n\nVanringham laughed. \"I might have recognized your hand in the late\ndisturbances, sir. As matters stand, I can only thank your Grace and regret\nthat I have earlier secured employment. I've been, since April, valet to\nthe old Prince de G\u00e2tinais, Monsieur de Soyecourt's father.\"\n\n\"Yet lackeyship smacks, however vaguely, of an honest livelihood. You\ndisappoint me, Mr. Vanringham.\"\n\n\"Nay, believe me, I yet pilfer a cuff-button or perhaps a jewel, when\noccasion offers, lest any of my talents rust. For we reside at Beaujolais\nyonder, my Lord Duke, where we live in retirement and give over our old\nage to curious chemistries. It suits me well enough. I find the air of\nBeaujolais excellent, my duties none too arduous, and the girls of the\ncountry-side neither hideous nor obdurate. Oho, I'm tolerably content at\nBeaujolais--the more for that 'tis expedient just now to go more softly\nthan ever Ahab did of old.\"\n\n\"Lest your late associates get wind of your whereabouts? In that I don't\nquestion your discretion, Mr. Vanringham. And out of pure friendliness I\nwarn you Paris is a very hotbed of hot-headed Jacobites who would derive\nunmerited pleasure from getting a knife into your ribs.\"\n\n\"Yet on an occasion of such importance--\" Vanringham began; then marvelled\nin reply to the Duke's look of courteous curiosity: \"You han't heard,\nsir, that my master's son is unexpectedly become the next Grand Duke of\nNoumaria!\"\n\n\"Zounds!\" said his Grace of Ormskirk, all alert, \"is old Ludwig dead\nat last? Why, then, the damned must be holding a notable carnival by\nthis, in honor of his arrival. Hey, but there was a merry rascal, a\nthorough-paced--\" He broke off short. He laughed. \"What the devil, man!\nMonsieur de Soyecourt is Ludwig's nephew, I grant you, on the maternal\nside, but Ludwig left a son. De Soyecourt remains de Soyecourt so long\nas Prince Rudolph lives,--and Prince Rudolph is to marry the Elector of\nBadenburg's daughter this autumn, so that we may presently look for any\nnumber of von Freistadts to perpetuate the older branch. Faith, you should\nstudy your _Genealogischer Hofkalender_ more closely, Mr. Vanringham.\"\n\n\"Oh, but very plainly your Grace has heard no word of the appalling tragedy\nthat hath made our little Louis a reigning monarch--\"\n\nWith gusto Francis Vanringham narrated the details of Duke Ludwig's last\nmad freak [Footnote: In his _Journal_ Horace Calverley gives a long and\ncurious account of the disastrous masque at Breschau of which he, then on\nthe Grand Tour, had the luck to be an eye-witness. His hints as to the part\nplayed in the affair by Kaunitz are now, of course, largely discredited by\nthe later confessions of de Puysange.] which, as the world knows, resulted\nin the death of both Ludwig and his son, as well as that of their five\ncompanions in the escapade,--with gusto, for in progress the soul of the\nformer actor warmed to his subject. But Ormskirk was sensibly displeased.\n\n\"Behold what is termed a pretty kettle of fish!\" said the Duke, in\nmeditation, when Vanringham had made an end. \"Plainly, Gaston cannot fight\nthe rascal, since Hop-o'-my-thumb is now, most vexatiously, transformed\ninto a quasi-Royal Personage, Assassination, I fear, is out of the\nquestion. So all our English plans will go to pot. A Frenchman will reign\nin Noumaria,--after we had not only bought old Ludwig, but had paid for\nhim, too! Why, I suppose he gave that damnable masquerade on the strength\nof having our money,--good English money, mark you, Mr. Vanringham, that we\nhave to squeeze out of honest tax-payers to bribe such, rascals with, only\nto have them, cheat us by cooking themselves to a crisp! This is annoying,\nMr. Vanringham.\"\n\n\"I don't entirely follow your Grace--\"\n\n\"It is not perhaps desirable you should. Yet I give you a key. It is\nprofoundly to be deplored that little Louis de Soyecourt, who cannot draw\na contented breath outside of his beloved Paris, should be forced to marry\nVictoria von Uhm, in his cousin's place,--yes, for Gaston will arrange\nthat, of course,--and afterward be exiled to a semi-barbarous Noumaria,\nwhere he must devote the rest of his existence to heading processions\nand reviewing troops, and signing proclamations and guzzling beer and\nsauerkraut. Nay, beyond doubt, Mr. Vanringham, this is deplorable. 'Tis an\nappalling condition of affairs: it reminds me of Ovid among the Goths, Mr.\nVanringham!\"\n\n\"I'm to understand, then--?\" the valet stammered.\n\n\"You are to understand that I am more deeply your debtor than I could\ndesire you to believe; that I am going to tell the Marquis de Soyecourt all\nwhich I have told you, though I must reword it for him, as eloquently as\nmay be possible; and that I even now feel myself to be Ciceronic.\" The Duke\nof Ormskirk passed on with a polite nod.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNext day they gossiped busily at Versailles over the sudden disappearance\nof Louis de Soyecourt. No more was heard of him for months. The mystery was\ndiscussed, and by the wits embroidered, and by the imaginative annotated,\nbut it was never solved until the following September.\n\n\nI\n\nFor it was in September that, upon the threshold of the _Golden\nPomegranate_, at Manneville in Poictesme, Monsieur Louis Quillan paused,\nand gave the contented little laugh which had of late become habitual with\nhim. \"We are en f\u00eate to-night, it appears. Has the King, then, by any\nchance dropped in to supper with us, Nelchen?\"\n\nSilently the girl bestowed a provisional pat upon one fold of the white\ntable-cloth and regarded the result with critical approval. All being\nin blameless order, she moved one of the candlesticks the width of a\nneedle. The table was now garnished to the last resource of the _Golden\nPomegranate_: the napery was snow, the glassware and the cutlery shone with\na frosty glitter, and the great bowl of crimson roses afforded the exact\nsplurge of vainglorious color and glow she had designed. Accordingly, being\nnow at leisure, Nelchen now came toward Monsieur Quillan, lifting her lips\nto his precisely as a child might have done.\n\n\"Not quite the King, my Louis. None the less I am sure that Monseigneur\nis an illustrious person. He arrived not two hours ago--\" She told how\nMonseigneur had come in a coach, very splendid; even his lackeys were\nresplendent. Monseigneur would stay overnight and would to-morrow push\non, to Beaus\u00e9ant. He had talked with her,--a kindly old gentleman, but so\nstately that all the while she had been the tiniest thought afraid of him.\nHe must be some exalted nobleman, Nelchen considered,--a marquis at the\nvery least.\n\nMeantime diminutive Louis Quillan had led her to the window-seat beneath\nthe corridor, and sat holding one plump trifle of a hand, the, while\nher speech fluttered bird-like from this topic to that; and be regarded\nNelchen Thorn with an abysmal content. The fates, he considered, had been\ncommendably generous to him.\n\nSo he leaned back from her a little, laughing gently, and marked what a\nquaint and eager child it was. He rejoiced that she was beautiful, and\ntriumphed still more to know that even if she had not been beautiful it\nwould have made slight difference to him. The soul of Nelchen was enough.\nYet, too, it was desirable this soul should be appropriately clad, that she\nshould have, for instance, these big and lustrous eyes,--plaintive eyes,\nsuch as a hamadryad would conceivably possess, since they were beyond doubt\nthe candid and appraising eyes of some woodland creature, and always seemed\nto find the world not precisely intimidating, perhaps, yet in the ultimate\na very curious place where one trod gingerly. Still, this Nelchen was a\npractical body, prone to laughter,--as in nature, any person would be whose\nmouth was all rotund and tiny scarlet curves. Why, it was, to a dimple,\nthe mouth which Fran\u00e7ois Boucher bestowed on his sleek goddesses! Louis\nQuillan was sorry for poor Boucher painting away yonder at a noisy garish\nVersailles, where he would never see that perfect mouth the artist had so\noften dreamed of. No, not in the sweet flesh at least; lips such as these\nwere unknown at Versailles....\n\nAnd but four months ago he had fancied himself to be in love with H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\nde Puysange, he remembered; and, by and large, he still considered H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\na delightful person. Yes, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne had made him quite happy last spring: and\nwhen they found she was with child, and their first plan failed, she had\nvery adroitly played out their comedy to win back Gaston in time to avoid\nscandal. Yes, you could not but admire H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, yet, even so....\n\n\"--and he asked me, oh, so many questions about you, Louis--\"\n\n\"About me?\" said Louis Quillan, blankly. He was all circumspection now.\n\n\"About my lover, you stupid person. Monseigneur assumed, somehow, that I\nwould have a lover or two. You perceive that he at least is not a stupid\nperson.\" And Nelchen tossed her head, with a touch of the provocative.\n\nLouis Quillan did what seemed advisable. \"--and, furthermore, your\nstupidity is no excuse for rumpling my hair,\" said Nelchen, by and by.\n\n\"Then you should not pout,\" replied Monsieur Quillan. \"Sanity is entirely\ntoo much to require of any man when you pout. Besides, your eyes are so\nbig and so bright they bewilder one. In common charity you ought to wear\nspectacles, Nelchen,--in sheer compassion toward mankind.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur, also, has wonderful eyes, Louis. They are like the\nstars,--very brilliant and cool and incurious, yet always looking at you as\nthough you were so insignificant that the mere fact of your presuming to\nexist at all was a trifle interesting.\"\n\n\"Like the stars!\" Louis Quillan had flung back the shutter. It was a\ntranquil evening in September, with no moon as yet, but with a great\nmultitude of lesser lights overhead. \"Incurious like the stars! They do\ndwarf one, rather. Yet just now I protest to you, infinitesimal man that I\nam, I half-believe le bon Dieu loves us so utterly that He has kindled all\nthose pretty tapers solely for our diversion. He wishes us to be happy,\nNelchen; and so He has given us the big, fruitful, sweet-smelling world\nto live in, and our astonishing human bodies to live in, with contented\nhearts, and with no more vain desires, no loneliness--Why, in a word, He\nhas given us each other. Oh, beyond doubt, He loves us, my Nelchen!\"\n\nFor a long while the girl was silent. Presently she spoke, half-hushed,\nlike one in the presence of sanctity. \"I am happy. For these three months I\nhave been more happy than I had thought was permissible on earth. And yet,\nLouis, you tell me that those stars are worlds perhaps like ours,--think of\nit, my dear, millions and millions of worlds like ours, and on each world\nperhaps a million of lovers like us! It is true that among them all no\nwoman loves as I do, for that would be impossible. Yet think of it, mon\nami, how inconsiderable a thing is the happiness of one man and of one\nwoman in this immensity! Why, we are less than nothing, you and I! Oh\u00e9, I\nam afraid, hideously afraid, Louis,--for we are such little folk and the\nuniverse is so big. And always the storms go about it, and its lightnings\nthrust at us, and the waters of it are clutching at our feet, and its laws\nare not to be changed--Oh, it is big and cruel, my dear, and we are adrift\nin it, we who are so little!\"\n\nHe again put forth his hand toward her. \"What a morbid child it is!\" said\nLouis Quillan. \"I can assure you I have resided in this same universe just\ntwice as long as you, and I find that upon the whole the establishment\nis very creditably conducted. There arrives, to be sure, an occasional\ntornado, or perhaps an earthquake, each with its incidental inconveniences.\nOn the other hand, there is every evening a lavishly arranged sunset, like\ngratis fireworks, and each morning (I am credibly informed) a sunrise of\nwhich poets and energetic people are pleased to speak highly; while every\nyear spring comes in, like a cosmical upholsterer, and refurnishes the\nentire place, and makes us glad to live. Nay, I protest to you, this is\nan excellent world, my Nelchen! and likewise I protest to you that in its\nhistory there was never a luckier nor a happier man than I.\"\n\nNelchen considered. \"Well,\" she generously conceded; \"perhaps, after all,\nthe stars are more like diamonds.\"\n\nLouis Quillan chuckled. \"And since when were you a connoisseur of diamonds,\nmy dear?\"\n\n\"Of course I have never actually seen any. I would like to, though--yes,\nLouis, what I would really like would be to have a bushelful or so of\ndiamonds, and to marry a duke--only the duke would have to be you, of\ncourse,--and to go to Court, and to have all the fine ladies very jealous\nof me, and for them to be very much in love with you, and for you not to\ncare a sou for them, of course, and for us both to see the King.\" Nelchen\npaused, quite out of breath after this ambitious career in the imaginative.\n\n\"To see the King, indeed!\" scoffed little Louis Quillan. \"Why, we would see\nonly a very disreputable pockmarked wornout lecher if we did.\"\n\n\"Still,\" she pointed out, \"I would like to see a king. Simply because I\nnever have done so before, you conceive.\"\n\n\"At times, my Nelchen, you are effeminate. Eve ate the apple for that\nidentical reason. Yet what you say is odd, because--do you know?--I once\nhad a friend who was by way of being a sort of king.\"\n\nNelchen gave a squeal of delight. \"And you never told me about him! I\nloathe you.\"\n\nLouis Quillan did what seemed advisable. \"--and, furthermore, your\nloathsomeness is no excuse for rumpling my hair,\" said Nelchen, by and by.\n\n\"But there is so little to tell. His father had married the Grand Duke\nof Noumaria's daughter,--over yonder between Silesia and Badenburg, you\nmay remember. And so last spring when the Grand Duke and the Prince were\nboth killed in that horrible fire, my friend quite unexpectedly became a\nking--oh, king of a mere celery-patch, but still a sort of king. Figure to\nyourself, Nelchen! they were going to make my poor friend marry the Elector\nof Badenburg's daughter,--and Victoria von Uhm has perfection stamped upon\nher face in all its odious immaculacy,--and force him to devote the rest\nof his existence to heading processions and reviewing troops, and signing\nproclamations, and guzzling beer and sauerkraut. Why, he would have been\nlike Ovid among the Goths, my Nelchen!\"\n\n\"But he could have worn such splendid uniforms!\" said Nelchen. \"And\ndiamonds!\"\n\n\"You mercenary wretch!\" said he. Louis Quillan then did what seemed\nadvisable; and presently he added, \"In any event, the horrified man ran\naway.\"\n\n\"That was silly of him,\" said Nelchen Thorn. \"But where did he run to?\"\n\nLouis Quillan considered. \"To Paradise,\" he at last decided. \"And there he\nfound a disengaged angel, who very imprudently lowered herself to the point\nof marrying him. And so he lived happily ever afterward. And so, till the\nday of his death, he preached the doctrine that silliness is the supreme\nwisdom.\"\n\n\"And he regretted nothing?\" Nelchen said, after a meditative while.\n\nLouis Quillan began to laugh. \"Oh, yes! at times he profoundly regretted\nVictoria von Uhm.\"\n\nThen Nelchen gave him a surprise, for the girl bent toward him and leaned\none hand upon each shoulder. \"Diamonds are not all, are they, Louis?\nI thank you, dear, for telling me of what means so much to you. I can\nunderstand, I think, because for a long while I have tried to know and care\nfor everything that concerns you.\"\n\nThe little man had risen to his feet. \"Nelchen--!\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Nelchen Thorn; \"Monseigneur is coming down to his supper.\"\n\n\nII\n\nIt was a person of conspicuous appearance, both by reason of his great\nheight and leanness as well as his extreme age, who now descended the\nstraight stairway leading from the corridor above. At Court they would have\ntold you that the Prince de G\u00e2tinais was a trifle insane, but he troubled\nthe Court very little, since he had spent the last twenty years, with brief\nintermissions, at his ch\u00e2teau near Beaujolais, where, as rumor buzzed\nit, he had fitted out a laboratory, and had devoted his old age to the\nstudy of chemistry. \"Between my flute and my retorts, my bees and my\nchocolate-creams,\" the Prince was wont to say, \"I manage to console myself\nfor the humiliating fact that even Death has forgotten my existence.\" For\nhe had a child's appetite for sweets, and was at this time past eighty,\nthough still well-nigh as active as Antoine de Soyecourt had ever been,\neven when--a good half-century ago--he had served, with distinction under\nLouis Quatorze.\n\nTo-night the Prince de G\u00e2tinais was all in steel-gray, of a metallic\nlustre, with prodigiously fine ruffles at his throat and wrists. You would\nhave found something spectral in the tall, gaunt old man, for his periwig\nwas heavily powdered, and his deep-wrinkled countenance was of an absolute\nwhite, save for the thin, faintly bluish lips and the inklike glitter of\nhis narrowing eyes, as he now regarded the couple waiting hand in hand\nbefore him, like children detected in mischief.\n\nLittle Louis Quillan had drawn an audible breath at first sight of the\nnewcomer. Monsieur Quillan did not speak, however, but merely waited.\n\n\"You have fattened,\" the Prince de G\u00e2tinais said, at last, \"I wish I could\nfatten. It is incredible that a man who eats pounds of sugar daily should\nyet remain a skeleton.\" His voice was guttural, and a peculiar slur\nran through his speech, caused by the loss of his upper front teeth at\nRamillies.\n\nLouis Quillan came of a stock not lightly abashed. \"I have fattened on a\nnew diet, monsieur,--on happiness. But, ma foi! I am discourteous. Permit\nme, my father, to present Mademoiselle Nelchen Thorn, who has so far\nhonored me as to consent to become my wife. 'Nelchen, I present to you my\nfather, the Prince de G\u00e2tinais.\"\n\n\"Oh--?\" observed Nelchen, midway in her courtesy.\n\nBut the Prince had taken her fingers and he kissed them quite as though\nthey had been the finger-tips of the all-powerful Pompadour at Versailles\nyonder. \"I salute the future Marquise de Soyecourt. You young people will\nsup with me, then?\"\n\n\"No, monseigneur, for I am to wait upon the table,\" said Nelchen, \"and\nFather is at Sig\u00e9an overnight, having the mare shod, and there is only\nLeon, and, oh, thank you very much indeed, monseigneur, but I had much\nrather wait on the table.\"\n\nThe Prince waved his hand. \"My valet, mademoiselle, is at your disposal.\nVanringham!\" he called.\n\nFrom the corridor above descended a tall red-headed fellow in black.\n\"Monseigneur--?\"\n\n\"Go!\" quickly said Louis de Soyecourt, while the Prince spoke with his\nvalet,--\"go, Nelchen, and make yourself even more beautiful if such a thing\nbe possible. He will never resist you, my dear--ah, no, that is out of\nnature.\"\n\n\"You will find more plates in the cupboard, Monsieur Vanringham,\" remarked\nNelchen, as she obediently tripped up the stairway, toward her room in the\nright wing. \"And the knives and forks are in the second drawer.\"\n\nSo Vanringham laid two covers in discreet silence; then bowed and withdrew\nby the side door that led to the kitchen. The Prince had seated himself\nbeside the open fire, where he yawned and now looked up with a smile.\n\n\"Well, Louis,\" said the Prince de G\u00e2tinais--\"so Monsieur de Puysange and I\nhave run you to earth at last. And I find you have determined to defy me,\neh?\"\n\n\nIII\n\n\"I trust there is no question of defiance,\" Louis de Soyecourt equably\nreturned. \"Yet I regret you should have been at pains to follow me, since I\nstill claim the privilege of living out my life in my own fashion.\"\n\n\"You claim a right which never existed, my little son. It is not demanded\nof any man that he be happy, whereas it is manifestly necessary for a\ngentleman to obey his God, his King, and his own conscience without\nswerving. If he also find time for happiness, well and good; otherwise, he\nmust be unhappy. But, above all, he must intrepidly play out his allotted\npart in the good God's scheme of things, and must with due humbleness\nrecognize that the happiness or the unhappiness of any man alive is a\ntrivial consideration as against the fulfilment of this scheme.\"\n\n\"You and Nelchen are much at one there,\" the Marquis lightly replied; \"yet,\nfor my part, I fancy that Providence is not particularly interested in who\nhappens to be the next Grand Duke of Noumaria.\"\n\nThe Prince struck with his hand upon the arm of his chair. \"You dare to\njest! Louis, your levity is incorrigible. France is beaten, discredited\namong nations, naked to her enemies. She lies here, between England and\nPrussia, as in a vise. God summons you, a Frenchman, to reign in Noumaria,\nand in addition affords you a chance to marry that weathercock of\nBadenburg's daughter. Ah, He never spoke more clearly, Louis. And you would\nreply with a shallow jest! Why, Badenburg and Noumaria just bridge that\nawkward space between France and Austria. Your accession would confirm the\nEmpress,--Gaston de Puysange has it in her own hand, yonder at Versailles!\nI tell you it is all planned that France and Austria will combine, Louis!\nThink of it,--our France on her feet again, mistress of Europe, and every\nwhit of it your doing, Louis,--ah, my boy, my boy, you cannot refuse!\"\n\nThus he ran on in a high, disordered voice, pleading, clutching at his son\nwith a strange new eagerness which now possessed the Prince de G\u00e2tinais.\nHe was remembering the France which he had known; not the ignoble, tawdry\nFrance of the moment, misruled by women, rakes, confessors, and valets, but\nthe France of his dead Sun King; and it seemed to Louis de Soyecourt that\nthe memory had brought back with it the youth of his father for an instant.\nJust for a heart-beat, the lank man towered erect, his cheeks pink, and\nevery muscle tense.\n\nThen Louis de Soyecourt shook his head. In England's interest, as he now\nknew, Ormskirk had played upon de Soyecourt's ignorance and his love of\npleasure, as an adept plays upon the strings of a violin; but de Soyecourt\nhad his reason, a gigantic reason, for harboring no grudge against the\nEnglishman.\n\n\"Frankly, my father, I would not give up Nelchen though all Europe depended\nupon it. I am a coward, perhaps; but I have my chance of happiness, and\nI mean to take it. So Cousin Otto is welcome to the duchy. I infinitely\nprefer Nelchen.\"\n\n\"Otto! a general in the Prussian army, Frederick's property, Frederick's\nidolater!\" The old Prince now passed from an apex of horror to his former\npleading tones. \"But, then, it is not necessary you give up Nelchen. Ah,\nno, a certain latitude is permissible in these matters, you understand. She\ncould be made a countess, a marquise,--anything you choose to demand, my\nLouis. And you could marry Princess Victoria just the same--\"\n\n\"Were you any other man, monsieur,\" said Louis de Soyecourt, \"I would,\nof course, challenge you. As it is, I can only ask you to respect my\nhelplessness. It is very actual helplessness, sir, for Nelchen has been\nbred in such uncourtly circles as to entertain the most provincial notions\nabout becoming anybody's whore.\"\n\nNow the Prince de G\u00e2tinais sank back into the chair. He seemed incredibly\nold now. \"You are right,\" he mumbled,--\"yes, you are right, Louis. I have\ntalked with her. With her that would be impossible. These bourgeois do not\nunderstand the claims of noble birth.\"\n\nThe younger man had touched him upon the shoulder. \"My father,--\" he began.\n\n\"Yes, I am your father,\" said the other, dully, \"and it is that which\npuzzles me. You are my own son, and yet you prefer your happiness to\nthe welfare of France, to the very preservation of France. Never in six\ncenturies has there been a de Soyecourt to do that. God and the King we\nserved ... six centuries ... and to-day my own son prefers an innkeeper's\ndaughter...\" His voice trailed and slurred like that of one speaking in his\nsleep, for he was an old man, and by this the flare of his excitement had\nquite burned out, and weariness clung about his senses like a drug. \"I will\ngo back to Beaujolais ... to my retorts and my bees ... and forget there\nwas never a de Soyecourt in six centuries, save my own son....\"\n\n\"My father!\" Louis de Soyecourt cried, and shook him gently. \"Ah, I dare\nsay you are right, in theory. But in practice I cannot give her up. Surely\nyou understand--why, they tell me there was never a more ardent lover than\nyou. They tell me--And you would actually have me relinquish Nelchen, even\nafter you have seen her! Yet remember, monsieur, I love her much as you\nloved my mother,--that mettlesome little princess whom you stole from the\nvery heart of her court.[Footnote: The curious may find further details of\nthe then Marquis de Soyecourt's abduction of the Princess Clotilda in the\nvoluminous pages of Hulot, under the year 1708.] Ah, I have heard tales of\nyou, you conceive. And Nelchen means as much to me as once my mother meant\nto you, remember--She means youth, and happiness, and a tiny space of\nlaughter before I, too, am worm's-meat, and means a proper appreciation of\nGod's love for us all, and means everything a man's mind clutches at when\nhe wakens from some forgotten dream that leaves him weeping with sheer\nadoration of its beauty. Ho, never was there a kinder father than you,\nmonsieur. You have spoiled me most atrociously, I concede; and after so\nmany years you cannot in decency whip about like this and deny me my very\nlife. Why, my father it is your little Louis who is pleading with you,--and\nyou have never denied me anything! See, now, how I presume upon your\nweakness. I am actually bullying you into submission--bullying you through\nyour love for me. Eh, we love greatly, we de Soyecourts, and give all for\nlove. Your own life attests that, monsieur. Now, then, let us recognize the\nfact we are de Soyecourts, you and I. Ah, my father,--\"\n\nThus he babbled on, for the sudden languor of the Prince had alarmed him,\nand Louis de Soyecourt, to afford him justice, loved his father with a\nheartier intensity than falls to the portion of most parents. To arouse the\nsemi-conscious man was his one thought. And now he got his reward, for the\nPrince de G\u00e2tinais opened his keen old eyes, a trifle dazedly, and drew a\ndeep breath which shook his large frail body through and through.\n\n\"Let us recognize that we are de Soyecourts, you and I,\" he repeated, in a\nnew voice. \"After all, I cannot drag you to Noumaria by the scruff of your\nneck like a truant school-boy. Yes, let us recognize the fact that we are\nde Soyecourts, you and I.\"\n\n\"Heh, in that event,\" said the Marquis, \"we must both fall upon our knees\nforthwith. For look, my father!\"\n\nNelchen Thorn was midway in her descent of the stairs. She wore her simple\nbest. All white it was, and yet the plump shoulders it displayed were not\nput to shame. Rather must April clouds and the snows of December retire\nabashed, as lamentably inefficient analogues, the Marquis meditated; and as\nshe paused starry-eyed and a thought afraid, it seemed to him improbable\nthat even the Prince de G\u00e2tinais could find it in his heart greatly to\nblame his son.\n\n\"I begin to suspect,\" said the Prince, \"that I am Jacob of old, and that\nyou are a very young cherub venturing out of Paradise through motives of\ncuriosity. Eh, my dear, let us see what entertainment we can afford you\nduring your visit to earth.\" He took her hand and led her to the table.\n\n\nIV\n\nVanringham served. Never was any one more blithe than the lean Prince de\nG\u00e2tinais. The latest gossip of Versailles was delivered, with discreet\nemendations; he laughed gayly; and he ate with an appetite. There was a\nblight among the cattle hereabouts? How deplorable! witchcraft, beyond\ndoubt. And Louis passed as a piano-tuner?--because there were no pianos in\nManneville. Excellent! he had always given Louis credit for a surpassing\ncleverness; now it was demonstrated. In fine, the Prince de G\u00e2tinais became\nso jovial that Nelchen was quite at ease, and Louis de Soyecourt became\nvaguely alarmed. He knew his father, and for the Prince to yield thus\nfacilely was incredible. Still, his father had seen Nelchen, had talked\nwith Nelchen....\n\nNow the Prince rose. \"Fresh glasses, Vanringham,\" he ordered; and then: \"I\ngive you a toast. Through desire of love and happiness, you young people\nhave stolen a march on me. Eh, I am not Sgarnarelle of the comedy!\ntherefore, I drink cheerfully to love and happiness, I consider Louis is\nnot in the right, but I know that he is wise, my daughter, as concerns his\nsoul's health, in clinging to you rather than to a tinsel crown. Of Fate\nI have demanded--like Sgarnarelle of the comedy,--prosaic equity and\ncommon-sense; of Fate he has in turn demanded happiness; and Fate will at\nher convenience decide between us. Meantime I drink to love and happiness,\nsince I, too, remember. I know better than to argue with Louis, you\nobserve, my Nelchen; we de Soyecourts are not lightly severed from any\nnotion we may have taken up. In consequence I drink to your love and\nhappiness!\"\n\nThey drank. \"To your love, my son,\" said the Prince de G\u00e2tinais,--\"to the\ntrue love of a de Soyecourt.\" And afterward he laughingly drank: \"To your\nhappiness, my daughter,--to your eternal happiness.\"\n\nNelchen sipped. The two men stood with drained glasses. Now on a sudden the\nPrince de G\u00e2tinais groaned and clutched his breast.\n\n\"I was always a glutton,\" he said, hoarsely. \"I should have been more\nmoderate--I am faint--\"\n\n\"Salts are the best thing in the world,\" said Nelchen, with fine readiness.\nShe was half-way up the stairs. \"A moment, monseigneur,--a moment, and I\nfetch salts.\" Nelchen Thorn had disappeared into her room.\n\n\nV\n\nThe Prince sat drumming upon the table with his long white fingers. He had\nwaved the Marquis and Vanringham aside. \"A passing weakness,--I am not\nadamant,\" he had said, half-peevishly.\n\n\"Then I prescribe another glass of this really excellent wine,\" laughed\nlittle Louis de Soyecourt. At heart he was not merry, and his own\nunreasoning nervousness irritated him, for it seemed to the Marquis,\nquite irrationally, that the atmosphere of the cheery room was, without\nforerunnership, become tense and expectant, and was now quiet with much the\nhush which precedes the bursting of a thunder-storm. And accordingly he\nlaughed.\n\n\"I prescribe another glass, monsieur,\" said he. \"Eh, that is the true\npanacea for faintness--for every ill. Come, we will drink to the most\nbeautiful woman in Poictesme--nay, I am too modest,--to the most beautiful\nwoman in France, in Europe, in the whole universe! _Feriam sidera_, my\nfather! and confound all mealy-mouthed reticence, for you have both seen\nher. Confess, am I not a lucky man? Come, Vanringham, too, shall drink. No\nglasses? Take Nelchen's, then. Come, you fortunate rascal, you shall drink\nto the bride from the bride's half-emptied glass. To the most beautiful\nwoman--Why, what the devil--?\"\n\nVanringham had blurted out an odd, unhuman sound. His extended hand shook\nand jerked, as if in irresolution, and presently struck the proffered\nglass from de Soyecourt's grasp. You heard the tiny crash, very audible in\nthe stillness, and afterward the irregular drumming of the old Prince's\nfinger-tips. He had not raised his head, had not moved.\n\nLouis de Soyecourt came to him, without speaking, and placed one hand under\nhis father's chin, and lifted the Prince's countenance, like a dead weight,\ntoward his own. Thus the two men regarded each the other. Their silence was\nrather horrible.\n\n\"It was not in vain that I dabbled with chemistry all these years,\" said\nthe guttural voice of the Prince de G\u00e2tinais, \"Yes, the child is dead by\nthis. Let us recognize the fact we are de Soyecourts, you and I.\"\n\nBut Louis de Soyecourt had flung aside the passive, wrinkled face, and\nthen, with a straining gesture, wiped the fingers that had touched it upon\nthe sleeve of his left arm. He turned to the stairway. His hand grasped the\nnewelpost and gripped it so firmly that he seemed less to walk than by one\ndespairing effort to lift an inert body to the first step. He ascended\nslowly, with a queer shamble, and disappeared into Nelchen's room.\n\n\nVI\n\n\"What next, monseigneur?\" said Vanringham, half-whispering.\n\n\"Why, next,\" said the Prince de G\u00e2tinais, \"I imagine that he will kill us\nboth. Meantime, as Louis says, the wine is really excellent. So you may\nrefill my glass, my man, and restore to me my vial of little tablets\"....\n\nHe was selecting a bonbon from the comfit-dish when his son returned into\nthe apartment. Very tenderly Louis de Soyecourt laid his burden upon a\nsettle, and then drew the older man toward it. You noted first how the\nthing lacked weight: a flower snapped from its stalk could hardly have\nseemed more fragile. The loosened hair strained toward the floor and\nseemed to have sucked all color from the thing to inform that thick hair's\ninsolent glory; the tint of Nelchen's lips was less sprightly, and for the\nsplendor of her eyes Death had substituted a conscientious copy in crayons:\notherwise there was no change; otherwise she seemed to lie there and muse\non something remote and curious, yet quite as she would have wished it to\nbe.\n\n\"See, my father,\" Louis de Soyecourt said, \"she was only a child,\nmore little even than I. Never in her brief life had she wronged any\none,--never, I believe, had she known an unkind thought. Always she\nlaughed, you understand--Oh, my father, is it not pitiable that Nelchen\nwill never laugh any more?\"\n\n\"I entreat of God to have mercy upon her soul,\" said the old Prince de\nG\u00e2tinais. \"I entreat of God that the soul of her murderer may dwell\neternally in the nethermost pit of hell.\"\n\n\"I would cry amen,\" Louis de Soyecourt said, \"if I could any longer believe\nin God.\"\n\nThe Prince turned toward him. \"And will you kill me now, Louis?\"\n\n\"I cannot,\" said the other. \"Is it not an excellent jest that I should\nbe your son and still be human? Yet as for your instrument, your cunning\nbutler--Come, Vanringham!\" he barked. \"We are unarmed. Come, tall man, for\nI who am well-nigh a dwarf now mean to kill you with my naked hands.\"\n\n\"Vanringham!\" The Prince leaped forward. \"Behind me, Vanringham!\" As the\nvalet ran to him the old Prince de G\u00e2tinais caught a knife from the table\nand buried it to the handle in Vanringham's breast. The lackey coughed,\nchoked, clutched his assassin by each shoulder; thus he stood with a\nbewildered face, shuddering visibly, every muscle twitching. Suddenly he\nshrieked, with an odd, gurgling noise, and his grip relaxed, and Francis\nVanringham seemed to crumple among his garments, so that he shrank rather\nthan fell to the floor. His hands stretched forward, his fingers spreading\nand for a moment writhing in agony, and then he lay quite still.\n\n\"You progress, my father,\" said Louis de Soyecourt, quietly. \"And what new\ninfamy may I now look for?\"\n\n\"A valet!\" said the Prince. \"You would have fought with him--a valet! He\ntopped you by six inches. And the man was desperate. Your life was in\ndanger. And your life is valuable.\"\n\n\"I have earlier perceived, my father, that you prize human life very\nhighly.\"\n\nThe Prince de G\u00e2tinais struck sharply upon the table. \"I prize the welfare\nof France. To secure this it is necessary that you and no other reign in\nNoumaria. But for the girl you would have yielded just now. So to the\nwelfare of France I sacrifice the knave at my feet, the child yonder, and\nmy own soul. Let us remember that we are de Soyecourts, you and I.\"\n\n\"Rather I see in you,\" began the younger man, \"a fiend. I see in you a far\nignobler Judas--\"\n\n\"And I see in you the savior of France. Nay, let us remember that we are de\nSoyecourts, you and I. And for six centuries it has always been our first\nduty to serve France. You behold only a man and a woman assassinated; I\nbehold thousands of men preserved from death, many thousands of women\nrescued from hunger and degradation. I have sinned, and grievously; ages of\ntorment may not purge my infamy; yet I swear it is well done!\"\n\n\"And I--?\" the little Marquis said.\n\n\"Why, your heart is slain, my son, for you loved this girl as I loved your\nmother, and now you can nevermore quite believe in the love God bears for\nus all; and my soul is damned irretrievably: but we are de Soyecourts, you\nand I, and accordingly we rejoice and drink to France, to the true love\nof a de Soyecourt! to France preserved! to France still mighty among her\npeers!\"\n\nLouis de Soyecourt stood quite motionless. Only his eyes roved toward his\nfather, then to the body that had been Nelchen's. He began to laugh as he\ncaught up his glass. \"You have conquered. What else have I to live for now?\nTo France, you devil!\"\n\n\"To France, my son!\" The glasses clinked. \"To the true love of a de\nSoyecourt!\"\n\nAnd immediately the Prince de G\u00e2tinais fell at his son's feet. \"You will go\ninto Noumaria?\"\n\n\"What does that matter now?\" the other wearily said. \"Yes, I suppose so.\nGet up, you devil!\"\n\nBut the Prince de G\u00e2tinais detained him, with hands like ice. \"Then we\npreserve France, you and I! We are both damned, I think, but it is worth\nwhile, Louis. In hell we may remember that it was well worth while. I have\nslain your very soul, my dear son, but that does not matter: France is\nsaved.\" The old man still knelt, looking upward. \"Yes, and you must forgive\nme, my son! For, see, I yield you what reparation I may. See, Louis,--I was\nchemist enough for two. Wine of my own vintage I have tasted, of the brave\nvintage which now revives all France. And I swear to you the child did not\nsuffer, Louis, not--not much. See, Louis! she did not suffer.\" A convulsion\ntore at and shook the aged body, and twitched awry the mouth that had\nsmiled so resolutely. Thus the Prince died.\n\nPresently Louis de Soyecourt knelt and caught up the wrinkled face between\nboth hands. \"My father--!\" said Louis de Soyecourt. Afterward he kissed\nthe dead lips tenderly. \"Teach me how to live, my father,\" said Louis de\nSoyecourt, \"for I begin to comprehend--in part I comprehend.\" Throughout\nthe moment Nelchen Thorn was forgotten: and to himself he too seemed to be\nfashioned of heroic stuff.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nTHE DUCAL AUDIENCE\n\n\n_As Played at Breschau, May 3, 1755_\n\n  \"_Venez, belle, venez,\n  Qu'on ne s\u00e7auroit tenir, et qui vous mutinez.\n  Void vostre galand! \u00e0 moi pour recompence\n  Vous pouvez faire une humble et douce reverence!\n  Adieu, l'evenement trompe un peu mes souhaits;\n  Mais tous les amoureux ne sont pas satisfaits._\"\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6\n\nGRAND DUKE OF NOUMARIA, formerly LOUIS DE SOYECOURT, tormented beyond\nmeasure with the impertinences of life.\nCOMTE DE CH\u00c2TEAUROUX, cousin to the Grand Duchess, and complies with\ncircumstance.\nA COACHMAN and two FOOTMEN.\n\nGRAND DUCHESS OF NOUMARIA, a capable woman.\nBARONESS VON ALTENBURG, a coquette.\n\n\nSCENE\n\nThe Palace Gardens at Breschau.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DUCAL AUDIENCE\n\n\n_PROEM:--In Default of the Hornpipe Customary to a Lengthy Interval between\nActs_\n\nLouis de Soyecourt fulfilled the promise made to the old Prince de\nG\u00e2tinais, so that presently went about Breschau, hailed by more or less\nenthusiastic plaudits, a fair and blue-eyed, fat little man, who smiled\nmechanically upon the multitude, and looked after the interests of France\nwearily, and (without much more ardor) gave over the remainder of his time\nto outrivalling his predecessor, unvenerable Ludwig von Freistadt, who\nuntil now had borne, among the eighteen grand dukes (largely of quite\ngrand-ducal morals) that had earlier governed in Noumaria, the palm for\nindolence and dissipation.\n\nAt moments, perhaps, the Grand Duke recollected the Louis Quillan who had\nspent three months in Manneville, but only, I think, as one recalls some\npleasurable acquaintance; Quillan had little resembled the Marquis de\nSoyecourt, rake, tippler and exquisite of Versailles, and in the Grand Duke\nyou would have found even less of Nelchen Thorn's betrothed. He was quite\ndead, was Quillan, for the man that Nelchen loved had died within the\nmoment of Nelchen's death. H\u00e9, the poor children! his Highness meditated.\nDead, both of them, both murdered four years since, slain in Poictesme\nyonder.... Eh bien, it was not necessary to engender melancholy.\n\nSo his Highness amused himself,--not very heartily, but at least to the\nlast resource of a flippant and unprudish age. Meantime his grumbling\nsubjects bored him, his duties bored him, his wife bored him, his\nmistresses bored him after the first night or two, and, above all, he most\nhideously bored himself. But I spare you a _chronique scandaleuse_ of Duke\nLouis' reign and come hastily to its termination, as more pertinent to the\nmatter I have now in hand.\n\nSuffice it, then, that he ruled in Noumaria five years; that he did what\nwas requisite by begetting children in lawful matrimony, and what was\nexpected of him by begetting some others otherwise; and that he stoutened\ndaily, and by and by decided that the young Baroness von Altenburg--not\nexcepting even her lovely and multifarious precursors,--was beyond doubt\npossessed of the brightest eyes in all history. Therefore did his Highness\nlay before the owner of these eyes a certain project, upon which the\nBaroness was in season moved to comment.\n\n\nI\n\n\"The idea,\" said the Baroness, \"is preposterous!\"\n\n\"Admirably put!\" cried the Grand Duke. \"We will execute it, then, the first\nthing in the morning.\"\n\n\"--and, besides, one could take only a portmanteau--\"\n\n\"And the capacity of a portmanteau is limited,\" his Highness agreed. \"Nay,\nI can assure you, after I had packed my coronet this evening there was\nhardly room for a change of linen. And I found it necessary to choose\nbetween the sceptre and a tooth-brush.\"\n\n\"Ah, Highness\" sighed the Baroness von Altenburg, \"will you never be\nserious? You plan to throw away a duchy, and in the act you jest like a\nschool-boy.\"\n\n\"Ma foi!\" retorted the Grand Duke, and looked out upon the moonlit gardens;\n\"as a loyal Noumarian, should I not rejoice at the good-fortune which is\nabout to befall my country? Nay, Amalia, morality demands my abdication,\"\nhe added, virtuously, \"and for this once morality and I are in complete\naccord.\"\n\nThe Baroness von Altenburg was not disposed to argue the singularity of any\nsuch agreement, the while that she considered Louis de Soyecourt's latest\nscheme.\n\nHe had, as prologue to its elucidation, conducted the Baroness into the\nsummer-house that his grandfather, good Duke Augustus, erected in the\nGardens of Breschau, close to the Fountain of the Naiads, and had en\nt\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate explained his notion. There were post-horses in Noumaria; there\nwas also an unobstructed road that led you to Vienna, and thence to the\nworld outside; and he proposed, in short, to quiet the grumbling of the\ndiscontented Noumarians by a second, and this time a final, vanishment from\noffice and the general eye. He submitted that the Baroness, as a patriot,\ncould not fail to weigh the inestimable benefit which would thus accrue to\nher native land.\n\nYet he stipulated that his exit from public life should be made in company\nwith the latest lady on whom he had bestowed his variable affections; and\nremembering this proviso, the Baroness, without exactly encouraging or\ndisencouraging his scheme, was at least not prone to insist on coupling him\nwith morality.\n\nShe contented herself with a truism. \"Indeed, your Highness, the example\nyou set your subjects is atrocious.\"\n\n\"And yet they complain!\" said the Grand Duke,--\"though I swear to you I\nhave always done the things I ought not to have done, and have left unread\nthe papers I have signed. What more, in reason, can one ask of a grand\nduke?\"\n\n\"You are indolent--\" remonstrated the lady.\n\n\"You--since we attempt the descriptive,\" said his Highness,--\"are\nadorable.\"\n\n\"--and that injures your popularity--\"\n\n\"Which, by the way, vanished with my waist.\"\n\n\"--and moreover you create scandals--\"\n\n\"'The woman tempted me,'\" quoted the Grand Duke; and added, reflectively,\n\"Amalia, it is very singular--\"\n\n\"Nay, I am afraid,\" the Baroness lamented, \"it is rather notoriously\nplural.\"\n\nBut the Grand Duke waved a dignified dissent, and continued, \"--that I\ncould never resist green eyes of a peculiar shade.\"\n\nThe Baroness, becoming vastly interested in the structure of her fan, went\non, with some severity, \"Your reputation--\"\n\n\"_De mortuis_--\" pleaded the Grand Duke.\n\n\"--is bad; and you go from bad to worse.\"\n\n\"By no means,\" said his Highness, \"since when I was nineteen--\"\n\n\"I will not believe it even of you!\" cried the Baroness von Altenburg.\n\n\"I assure you,\" his Highness protested, gravely, \"I was then a devil of a\nfellow! She was only twenty, and she, too, had big green eyes--\"\n\n\"And by this late period,\" said the lady, \"has in addition an infinity of\ngrandchildren.\"\n\n\"I happen to be barely forty!\" the Grand Duke said, with dignity.\n\n\"In which event the _Almanachen_ dating, say, from 1710--\"\n\n\"Are not unmarred by an occasional misprint. Truly I lament the ways of all\ntypographers, and I will explain the cause of their depravity, in Vienna.\"\n\n\"But I am not going to Vienna.\"\n\n\"'And Sapphira,'\" murmured his Highness, \"'fell down straightway at his\nfeet, and yielded up the ghost!' So beware, Amalia!\"\n\n\"I am not afraid, your Highness,--\"\n\n\"Nor in effect am I. Then we will let Europe frown and journalists\nmoralize, while we two gallop forward on the road that leads to Vienna and\nheaven?\"\n\n\"Or--\" the Baroness helpfully suggested.\n\n\"There is in this case no possible 'or.' Once out of Noumaria, we leave all\nthings behind save happiness.\"\n\n\"Among these trifles, your Highness, is a duchy.\"\n\n\"Hein?\" said the Grand Duke; \"what is it? A mere dot on the map, a pawn in\nthe game of politics. I give up the pawn and take--the queen.\"\n\n\"That is unwise,\" said the Baroness, with composure, \"and, besides, you are\nhurting my hand. Apropos of the queen--the Grand Duchess--\"\n\n\"Will heartily thank God for her deliverance. She will renounce me before\nthe world, and in secret almost worship me for my consideration.\"\n\n\"Yet a true woman,\" said the Baroness, oracularly, \"will follow a\nhusband--\"\n\n\"Till his wife makes her stop,\" said the little Grand Duke, his tone\nimplying that he knew whereof he spoke.\n\n\"--and if the Grand Duchess loved you--\"\n\n\"Oh, I think she would never mention it,\" said the Grand Duke, revolving in\nhis mind this novel idea. \"She has a great regard for appearances.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless--\"\n\n\"She will be Regent\"--and the Grand Duke chuckled. \"I can see her now,--St.\nElizabeth, with a dash of Boadicea. Noumaria will be a pantheon of the\nvirtues, and my children will be reared on moral aphorisms and rational\nfood, with me as a handy example of everything they should avoid. Deuce\ntake it, Amalia,\" he added, \"a father must in common decency furnish an\nexample to his children!\"\n\n\"Pray,\" asked the Baroness, \"do you owe it to your children, then, to take\nthis trip to Vienna--\"\n\n\"Ma foi!\" retorted the Grand Duke, \"I owe that to myself.\"\n\n\"--and thereby break the Grand Duchess' heart?\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" observed his Highness, \"you appear strangely deep in the\nconfidence of my wife.\"\n\nAgain the Baroness descended to aphorism. \"All women are alike, your\nHighness.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah! Well, I have heard,\" said the Grand Duke, \"that seven devils were\ncast out of Magdalene--\"\n\n\"Which means--?\"\n\n\"I have never heard of this being done to any other woman. Accordingly I\ndeduce that in all other women must remain--\"\n\n\"Beware, your Highness, of the crudeness of cynicism!\"\n\n\"I age,\" complained the Grand Duke, \"and one reaches years of indiscretion\nso early in the forties.\"\n\n\"You admit, then, discretion is desirable?\"\n\n\"I admit that,\" his Highness said, with firmness, \"of you alone.\"\n\n\"Am I, in truth,\" queried the Baroness, \"desirable?\" And in this patch of\nmoonlight she looked incredibly so.\n\n\"More than that,\" said the Grand Duke--\"you are dangerous. You are a menace\nto the peace of my Court. The young men make sonnets to your eyes, and the\nladies are ready to tear them out. You corrupt us, one and all. There is de\nCh\u00e2teauroux now--\"\n\n\"I assure you,\" protested the Baroness, \"Monsieur de Ch\u00e2teauroux is not the\nsort of person--\"\n\n\"But at twenty-five,\" the Grand Duke interrupted, \"one is invariably that\nsort of person.\"\n\n\"Phrases, your Highness!\"\n\n\"Phrases or not, it is decided. You shall make no more bad poets.\"\n\n\"You will,\" said the Baroness, \"put me to a vast expense for curl-papers.\"\n\n\"You shall ensnare no more admirers.\"\n\n\"My milliner will be inconsolable.\"\n\n\"In short, you must leave Noumaria--\"\n\n\"You condemn me to an exile's life of misery!\"\n\n\"Well, then, since misery loves company, I will go with you. For we should\nnever forget,\" his Highness added, with considerable kindliness, \"always\nto temper justice with mercy. So I have ordered a carriage to be ready at\ndawn.\"\n\nThe Baroness reflected; the plump little Grand Duke smiled. And he had\nreason, for there was about this slim white woman--whose eyes were colossal\nemeralds, and in show equivalently heatless, if not in effect,--so much\nof the _baroque_ that in meditation she appeared some prentice queen of\nFa\u00ebry dubious as to her incantations. Now, though, she had it--the mislaid\nabracadabra.\n\n\"I knew that I had some obstacle in mind--Thou shalt not commit adultery.\nNo, your Highness, I will not go.\"\n\n\"Remember Sapphira,\" said the Grand Duke, \"recall Herodias who fared\nhappily in all things, and by no means forget the portmanteau.\"\n\n\"I have not the least intention of going--\" the Baroness iterated, firmly.\n\n\"Nor would I ever suspect you of harboring such a thought. Still, a\nportmanteau, in case of an emergency--\"\n\n\"--although--\"\n\n\"Why, exactly.\"\n\n\"--although I am told the sunrise is very beautiful from the Gardens of\nBreschau.\"\n\n\"It is well worth seeing,\" agreed the Grand Duke, \"on certain\ndays--particularly on Thursdays. The gardeners make a specialty of them on\nThursdays.\"\n\n\"By a curious chance,\" the Baroness murmured, \"this is Wednesday.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said the Grand Duke, \"now you mention it, I believe it is.\"\n\n\"And I shall be here, on your Highness' recommendation, to see the\nsunrise--\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said the Grand Duke, \"to see the sunrise,--but with a\nportmanteau!\"\n\nThe Baroness was silent.\n\n\"With a portmanteau,\" entreated the Grand Duke. \"I am a connoisseur of\nportmanteaux. Say that I may see yours, Amalia.\"\n\nThe Baroness was silent.\n\n\"Say yes, Amalia. For to the student of etymology the very word\nportmanteau--\"\n\nThe Baroness bent toward him and said:\n\n\"I am sorry to inform your Highness that there is some one at the door of\nthe summer-house.\"\n\n\nII\n\nInasmuch as all Noumaria knew that its little Grand Duke, once closeted\nwith the lady whom he delighted to honor, did not love intrusions,\nand inasmuch as a discreet Court had learned, long ago, to regard\nthe summer-house as consecrate to his Highness and the Baroness von\nAltenburg,--for these reasons the Grand Duke was inclined to resent\ndisturbance of his privacy when he first peered out into the gardens.\n\nHis countenance was less severe when he turned again toward the Baroness,\nand it smacked more of bewilderment.\n\n\"It is only my wife,\" he said.\n\n\"And the Comte de Ch\u00e2teauroux,\" said the Baroness.\n\nThere is no denying that their voices were somewhat lowered. The chill and\nfrail beauty of the Grand Duchess was plainly visible from where they sat;\nto every sense a woman of snow, his Highness mentally decided, for her gown\nthis evening was white and the black hair powdered; all white she was, a\ncloud-tatter in the moonlight: yet with the Comte de Ch\u00e2teauroux as a foil,\nhis uniform of the Cuirassiers a big stir of glitter and color, she made an\nundeniably handsome picture; and it was, quite possibly, the Grand Duke's\n\u00e6sthetic taste which held him for the moment motionless.\n\n\"After all--\" he began, and rose.\n\n\"I am afraid that her Highness--\" the Baroness likewise commenced.\n\n\"She would be sure to,\" said the Grand Duke, and thereupon he sat down.\n\n\"I do not, however,\" said the Baroness, \"approve of eavesdropping.\"\n\n\"Oh, if you put it that way--\" agreed the Grand Duke, and he was rising\nonce more, when the voice of de Ch\u00e2teauroux stopped him.\n\n\"No, not at any cost!\" de Ch\u00e2teauroux; was saying; \"I cannot and I will not\ngive you up, Victoria!\"\n\n\"--though I have heard,\" said his Highness, \"that the moonlight is bad for\nthe eyes.\" Saying this, he seated himself composedly in the darkest corner\nof the summer-house.\n\n\"This is madness!\" the Grand Duchess said--\"sheer madness.\"\n\n\"Madness, if you will,\" de Ch\u00e2teauroux persisted, \"yet it is a madness too\npowerful and sweet to be withstood. Listen, Victoria,\"--and he waved his\nhand toward the palace, whence music, softened by the distance, came from\nthe lighted windows,--\"do you not remember? They used to play that air at\nStaarberg.\"\n\nThe Grand Duchess had averted her gaze from him. She did not speak.\n\nHe continued: \"Those were contented days, were they not, when we were boy\nand girl together? I have danced to that old-world tune so many times--with\nyou! And to-night, madame, it recalls a host of unforgettable things, for\nit brings back to memory the scent of that girl's hair, the soft cheek that\nsometimes brushed mine, the white shoulders which I so often had hungered\nto kiss, before I dared--\"\n\n\"Hein?\" muttered the Grand Duke.\n\n\"We are no longer boy and girl,\" the Grand Duchess said. \"All that lies\nbehind us. It was a dream--a foolish dream which we must forget.\"\n\n\"Can you in truth forget?\" de Ch\u00e2teauroux demanded,--\"can you forget it\nall, Victoria?--forget that night a Gnestadt, when you confessed you loved\nme? forget that day at Staarberg, when we were lost in the palace gardens?\"\n\n\"Mon Dieu, what a queer method!\" murmured the Grand Duke. \"The man makes\nlove by the almanac.\"\n\n\"Nay, dearest woman in the world,\" de Ch\u00e2teauroux went on, \"you loved me\nonce, and that you cannot have quite forgotten. We were happy then--very\nincredibly happy,--and now--\"\n\n\"Life,\" said the Grand Duchess, \"cannot always be happy.\"\n\n\"Ah, no, my dear! nor is it to be elated by truisms. But what a life is\nthis of mine,--a life of dreary days, filled with sick, vivid dreams of\nour youth that is hardly past as yet! And so many dreams, dear woman of my\nheart! in which the least remembered trifle brings back, as if in a flash,\nsome corner of the old castle and you as I saw you there,--laughing, or\ninsolent, or, it may be, tender. Ah, but you were not often tender! Just\nfor a moment I see you, and my blood leaps up in homage to my dear lady.\nThen instantly that second of actual vision is over, I am going prosaically\nabout the day's business, but I hunger more than ever--\"\n\n\"This,\" said the Grand Duke, \"is insanity.\"\n\n\"Yet I love better the dreams of the night,\" de Ch\u00e2teauroux went on; \"for\nthey are not made all of memories, sweetheart. Rather, they are romances\nwhich my love weaves out of multitudinous memories,--fantastic stories of\njust you and me that always end, if I be left to dream them out in comfort,\nvery happily. For there is in these dreams a woman who loves me, whose\nheart and body and soul are mine, and mine alone. Oh\u00e9, it is a wonderful\nvision while it lasts, though it be only in dreams that I am master of\nmy heart's desire, and though the waking be bitter...! Need it be just a\ndream, Victoria?\"\n\n\"Not but that he does it rather well, you know,\" whispered the Grand Duke\nto the Baroness von Altenburg, \"although the style is florid. Yet that last\nspeech was quite in my earlier and more rococo manner.\"\n\nThe Grand Duchess did not stir as de Ch\u00e2teauroux bent over her jewelled\nhand.\n\n\"Come! come now!\" he said. \"Let us not lose our only chance of happiness.\n'Come forth, O Galatea, and forget as thou comest, even as I already have\nforgot, the homeward way! Nay, choose with me to go a-shepherding--!'\"\n\n\"Oh, but to think of dragging in Theocritus!\" observed his Highness. \"Can\nthis be what they call seduction nowadays!\"\n\n\"I cannot,\" the Grand Duchess whispered, and her voice trembled. \"You know\nthat I cannot, dear.\"\n\n\"You will go!\" said de Ch\u00e2teauroux.\n\n\"My husband--\"\n\n\"A man who leaves you for each new caprice, who flaunts his mistresses in\nthe face of Europe.\"\n\n\"My children--\"\n\n\"Eh, mon Dieu! are they or aught else to stand in my way, now that I know\nyou love me!\"\n\n\"--it would be criminal--\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, but then you love me!\"\n\n\"--you act a dishonorable part, de Ch\u00e2teauroux,--\"\n\n\"That does not matter. You love me!\"\n\n\"I will never see you again,\" said the Grand Duchess, firmly. \"Go! I loathe\nyou, I loathe you, monsieur, even more than I loathe myself for having\nstooped to listen to you.\"\n\n\"You love me!\" said de Ch\u00e2teauroux, and took her in his arms.\n\nThen the Grand Duchess rested her head upon the shoulder of de Ch\u00e2teauroux,\nand breathed, \"God help me!--yes!\"\n\n\"Really,\" said the Grand Duke, \"I would never have thought it of Victoria.\nIt seems incredible for any woman of taste to be thus lured astray by\ncitations of the almanac and secondary Greek poets.\"\n\n\"You will come, then?\" the Count said.\n\nAnd the Grand Duchess answered, quietly, \"It shall be as you will.\"\n\nMore lately, while the Grand Duke and the Baroness craned their necks, and\nde Ch\u00e2teauroux bent, very slowly, over her upturned lips, the Grand\nDuchess struggled from him, saying, \"Hark, Philippe! for I heard some\none--something stirring--\"\n\n\"It was the wind, dear heart.\"\n\n\"Hasten!--I am afraid!--Oh, it is madness to wait here!\"\n\n\"At dawn, then,--in the gardens?\"\n\n\"Yes,--ah, yes, yes! But come, mon ami.\" And they disappeared in the\ndirection of the palace.\n\n\nIII\n\nThe Grand Duke looked dispassionately on their retreating figures;\ninquiringly on the Baroness; reprovingly on the moon, as though he rather\nsuspected it of having treated him with injustice.\n\n\"Ma foi,\" said his Highness, at length, \"I have never known such a passion\nfor sunrises. Shortly we shall have them announced as 'Patronized by the\nNobility.'\"\n\nThe Baroness said only, with an ellipsis, \"Her own cousin, too!\" [Footnote:\nBy courtesy rather than legally; Mademoiselle Berlin was, however,\nundoubtedly the Elector of Badenburg's sister, though on the wrong side of\nthe blanket; and to her (second) son by Louis Quinze his French Majesty\naccorded the title of Comte de Ch\u00e2teauroux.]\n\n\"Victoria,\" observed the Grand Duke, \"has always had the highest regard for\nher family; but in this she is going too far--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Baroness; \"as far as Vienna.\"\n\n\"--and I shall tell her that there are limits, Pardieu,\" the Grand Duke\nemphatically repeated, \"that there are limits.\"\n\n\"Whereupon, if I am not mistaken, she will reply that there\nare--baronesses.\"\n\n\"I shall then appeal to her better nature--\"\n\n\"You will find it,\" said the Baroness, \"strangely hard of hearing.\"\n\n\"--and afterward I shall have de Ch\u00e2teauroux arrested.\"\n\n\"On what grounds, your Highness?\"\n\n\"In fact,\" admitted the Grand Duke, \"we do not want a scandal\"\n\n\"It is no longer,\" the Baroness considered, \"altogether a question of what\nwe want.\"\n\n\"And, morbleu! there will be a horrible scandal--\"\n\n\"The public gazettes will thrive on it.\"\n\n\"--and trouble with her father, if not international complications--\"\n\n\"The armies of Noumaria and Badenburg have for years had nothing to do.\"\n\n\"--and later a divorce.\"\n\n\"The lawyers will call you blessed. In any event,\" the Baroness\nconscientiously added, \"your lawyers will. I am afraid that hers--\"\n\n\"Will scarcely be so courteous?\" the Grand Duke queried.\n\n\"It is not altogether impossible,\" the Baroness admitted, \"that in\npreparation of their briefs, they may light upon some other adjective.\"\n\n\"And, in short,\" his Highness summed it up, \"there will be the deuce to\npay.\"\n\n\"Oh, no! the piper,\" said the Baroness,--\"after long years of dancing. That\nis what moralists will be saying, I suspect.\"\n\nAnd this seemed so highly probable that the plump little Grand Duke\nfrowned, and lapsed into a most un-ducal sullenness.\n\n\"Your Highness,\" murmured the Baroness, \"I cannot express my feelings as to\nthis shocking revelation--\"\n\n\"Madame,\" said the Grand Duke, \"no more can I. At least, not in the\npresence of a lady.\"\n\n\"--But I have a plan--\"\n\n\"I,\" said the Grand Duke, \"have an infinity of plans; but de Ch\u00e2teauroux\nhas a carriage, and a superfluity of Bourbon blood; and Victoria has the\nobstinacy of a mule.\"\n\n\"--And my plan,\" said the Baroness, \"is a good one.\"\n\n\"It needs to be,\" said the Grand Duke.\n\nBut thereupon the Baroness von Altenburg unfolded to his Highness her\nscheme for preserving coherency in the reigning family of Noumaria, and the\nGrand Duke of that principality heard and marvelled.\n\n\"Amalia,\" he said, when she had ended, \"you should be prime-minister--\"\n\n\"Ah, your Highness,\" said the lady, \"you flatter me, for none of my sex has\never been sufficiently unmanly to make a good politician.\"\n\n\"--though, indeed,\" the Grand Duke reflected, \"what would a mere\nprime-minister do with lips like yours?\"\n\n\"He would set you an excellent example by admiring them from a distance. Do\nyou agree, then, to my plan?\"\n\n\"Why, ma foi, yes!\" said the Grand Duke, and he sighed. \"In the gardens at\ndawn.\"\n\n\"At dawn,\" said the Baroness, \"in the gardens.\"\n\n\nIV\n\nThat night the Grand Duke was somewhat impeded in falling asleep. He was\nseriously annoyed by the upsetment of his escape from the Noumarian exile,\nsince he felt that he had prodigally fulfilled his obligations, and in\nconsequence deserved a holiday; the duchy was committed past retreat to the\nFrench alliance, there were two legitimate children to reign after him, and\nbe the puppets of de Puysange and de Bernis, [Footnote: The Grand Duke,\nhowever, owed de Puysange some reparation for having begot a child upon the\nlatter's wife; and with de Bernis had not dissimilar ties, for the Marquis\nde Soyecourt had in Venice, in 1749, relinquished to him the beautiful nun\nof Muran, Maria Montepulci,--which lady de Bernis subsequently turned over\nto Giacomo Casanova, as is duly recorded in the latter's _M\u00e9moires_, under\nthe year 1753.] just as he had been. Truly, it was diverting, after a\ncandid appraisal of his own merits, to reflect that a dwarfish Louis de\nSoyecourt had succeeded where quite impeccable people like Bayard and du\nGuesclin had failed; by four years of scandalous living in Noumaria he\nhad confirmed the duchy to the French interest, had thereby secured the\nwavering friendship of Austria, and had, in effect, set France upon her\nfeet. Yes, the deed was notable, and he wanted his reward.\n\nTo be the forsaken husband, to play Sgarnarelle with all Europe as an\naudience, was, he considered, an entirely inadequate reward. That was out\nof the question, for, deuce take it! somebody had to be Regent while\nthe brats were growing up. And Victoria, as he had said, would make an\nadmirable Regent.\n\nHe was rather fond of his wife than otherwise. He appreciated the fact that\nshe never meddled with him, and he sincerely regretted she should have\ntaken a fancy to that good-for-nothing de Ch\u00e2teauroux. What qualms the poor\nwoman must be feeling at this very moment over the imminent loss of her\nvirtue! But love was a cruel and unreasonable lord.... There was Nelchen\nThorn, for instance.... He wondered would he have been happy with Nelchen?\nher hands were rather coarse about the finger-tips, as he remembered\nthem.... The hands of Amalia, though, were perfection....\n\nThen at last the body that had been Louis Quillan's fell asleep.\n\n\nV\n\nDiscontentedly the Grand Duke appraised the scene, and in the murky\ntwilight which heralded the day he found the world a cheerless place. The\nGardens of Breschau were deserted, save for a travelling carriage and\nits fretful horses, who stamped and snuffled within forty yards of the\nsummer-house.\n\n\"It appears,\" he said, \"that I am the first on the ground, and that de\nCh\u00e2teauroux is a dilatory lover. Young men degenerate.\"\n\nSaying this, he seated himself on a convenient bench, where de Ch\u00e2teauroux\nfound him a few minutes later, and promptly dropped a portmanteau at the\nducal feet.\n\n\"Monsieur le Comte,\" the Grand Duke said, \"this is an unforeseen pleasure.\"\n\n\"Your Highness!\" cried de Ch\u00e2teauroux, in astonishment.\n\n\"_Ludovicus_,\" said the Grand Duke, \"_Dei gratia Archi Dux Noumari\u00e6,\nPrinceps Gatinensis_, and so on.\" And de Ch\u00e2teauroux caressed his chin.\n\n\"I did not know,\" said the Grand Duke, \"that you were such an early riser.\nOr perhaps,\" he continued, \"you are late in retiring. Fy, fy, monsieur! you\nmust be more careful! You must not create a scandal in our little Court.\"\nHe shook his finger knowingly at Philippe de Ch\u00e2teauroux.\n\n\"Your Highness,--\" said the latter, and stammered into silence.\n\n\"You said that before,\" the Grand Duke leisurely observed.\n\n\"An affair of business--\"\n\n\"Ah! ah! ah!\" said the Grand Duke, casting his eye first toward the\nportmanteau and then toward the carriage, \"can it be that you are leaving\nNoumaria? We shall miss you, Comte.\"\n\n\"I was summoned very hastily, or I would have paid my respects to your\nHighness--\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said the Grand Duke, \"your departure is of a deplorable\nsuddenness--\"\n\n\"It is urgent, your Highness--\"\n\n\"--and yet,\" pursued the Grand Duke, \"travel is beneficial to young men.\"\n\n\"I shall not go far, your Highness--\"\n\n\"Nay, I would not for the world intrude upon your secrets, Comte--\"\n\n\"--But my estates, your Highness--\"\n\n\"--For young men will be young men, I know.\"\n\n\"--There is, your Highness, to be a sale of meadow land--\"\n\n\"Which you will find, I trust, untilled.\"\n\n\"--And my counsellor at law, your Highness, is imperative--\"\n\n\"At times,\" agreed the Grand Duke, \"the most subtle of counsellors is\nunreasonable. I trust, though, that she is handsome?\"\n\n\"Ah, your Highness--!\" cried de Ch\u00e2teauroux.\n\n\"And you have my blessing upon your culture of those meadow lands. Go in\npeace.\"\n\nThe Grand Duke was smiling on his wife's kinsman with extreme benevolence\nwhen the Baroness von Altenburg appeared in travelling costume and carrying\na portmanteau.\n\n\nVI\n\n\"Heydey!\" said the Grand Duke; \"it seems, that the legal representative of\nour good Baroness, also, is imperative.\"\n\n\"Your Highness!\" cried the Baroness, and she, too, dropped her burden.\n\n\"Every one,\" said the Grand Duke, \"appears to question my identity.\" And\nmeantime de Ch\u00e2teauroux turned from the one to the other in bewilderment.\n\n\"This,\" said the Grand Duke, after a pause, \"is painful. This is unworthy\nof you, de Ch\u00e2teauroux.\"\n\n\"Your Highness--!\" cried the Count.\n\n\"Again?\" said the Grand Duke, pettishly.\n\nThe Baroness applied her handkerchief to her eyes, and plaintively said,\n\"You do not understand, your Highness--\"\n\n\"I am afraid,\" said the Grand Duke, \"that I understand only too clearly.\"\n\n\"--and I confess I was here to meet Monsieur de Ch\u00e2teauroux--\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" cried the latter.\n\n\"Precisely,\" observed the Grand Duke, \"to compare portmanteaux; and you\nhad selected the interior of yonder carriage, no doubt, as an appropriate\nlocality.\"\n\n\"And I admit to your Highness--\"\n\n\"His Highness already knowing,\" the Grand Duke interpolated.\n\n\"--that we were about to elope.\"\n\n\"I can assure you--\" de Ch\u00e2teauroux began.\n\n\"Nay, I will take the lady's word for it,\" said the Grand Duke--\"though it\ngrieves me.\"\n\n\"We knew you--would never give your consent,\" murmured the Baroness, \"and\nwithout your consent I can not marry--\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" said the Grand Duke, \"I would never have given my consent to\nsuch fiddle-faddle.\"\n\n\"And we love each other.\"\n\n\"Fiddle-de-dee!\" said his Highness.\n\nBut de Ch\u00e2teauroux passed one hand over his brow. \"This,\" he said, \"is some\nhorrible mistake--\"\n\n\"It is,\" assented the Grand Duke, \"a mistake--and one of your making.\"\n\n\"--For I certainly did not expect the Baroness--\"\n\n\"To make a clean breast of it so readily?\" his Highness asked. \"Ah, but she\nis a lady of unusual candor.\"\n\n\"Indeed, your Highness--\" began de Ch\u00e2teauroux.\n\n\"Nay, Philippe,\" the Baroness entreated, \"confess to his Highness, as I\nhave done.\"\n\n\"Oh, but--!\" said de Ch\u00e2teauroux.\n\n\"I must beseech you to be silent,\" said the Grand Duke; \"you have already\nbrought scandal to our Court. Do not, I pray you, add profanity to the\ncatalogue of your offences. Why, I protest,\" he continued, \"even the Grand\nDuchess has heard of this imbroglio.\"\n\nIndeed, the Grand Duchess, hurrying from a pleached walkway, was already\nwithin a few feet of the trio, and appeared no little surprised to find in\nthis place her husband.\n\n\"I would not be surprised,\" said the Grand Duke, raising his eyes toward\nheaven, \"if by this time it were all over the palace.\"\n\n\nVII\n\nThen, as his wife waited, speechless, the Grand Duke gravely asked: \"You,\ntoo, have heard of this sad affair, Victoria? Ah, I perceive you have,\nand that you come in haste to prevent it,--even to pursue these misguided\nbeings, if necessary, as the fact that you come already dressed for the\njourney very eloquently shows. You are self-sacrificing, you possess a good\nheart, Victoria.\"\n\n\"I did not know--\" began the Grand Duchess.\n\n\"Until the last moment,\" the Grand Duke finished. \"Eh, I comprehend. But\nperhaps,\" he continued, hopefully, \"it is not yet too late to bring them to\ntheir senses.\"\n\nAnd turning toward the Baroness and de Ch\u00e2teauroux, he said:\n\n\"I may not hinder your departure if you two in truth are swayed by love,\nsince to control that passion is immeasurably beyond the prerogative\nof kings. Yet I beg you to reflect that the step you contemplate is\nirrevocable. Yes, and to you, madame, whom I have long viewed with a\npaternal affection--an emotion wholly justified by the age and rank for\nwhich it has pleased Heaven to preserve me,--to you in particular I would\naddress my plea. If with an entire heart you love Monsieur de Ch\u00e2teauroux,\nwhy, then--why, then, I concede that love is divine, and yonder carriage at\nyour disposal. But I beg you to reflect--\"\n\n\"Believe me,\" said the Baroness, \"we are heartily grateful for your\nHighness' magnanimity. We may, I deduce, depart with your permission?\"\n\n\"Oh, freely, if upon reflection--\"\n\n\"I can reflect only when I am sitting down,\" declared the Baroness. She\nhanded her portmanteau to de Ch\u00e2teauroux, and stepped into the carriage.\nAnd the Grand Duke noted that a coachman and two footmen had appeared, from\nnowhere in particular.\n\n\"To you, Monsieur le Comte,\" his Highness now began, with an Olympian\nfrown, \"I have naught to say. Under the cover of our hospitality you have\nendeavored to steal away the fairest ornament of our Court; I leave you\nto the pangs of conscience, if indeed you possess a conscience. But the\nBaroness is unsophisticated; she has been misled by your fallacious\narguments and specious pretence of affection. She has evidently been\nmisled,\" he said to the Grand Duchess, kindly, \"as any woman might be.\"\n\n\"As any woman might be!\" his wife very feebly echoed.\n\n\"And I shall therefore,\" continued the Grand Duke, \"do all within my power\nto dissuade her from this ruinous step. I shall appeal to her better\nnature, and not, I trust, in vain.\"\n\nHe advanced with dignity to the carriage, wherein the Baroness was seated.\n\"Amalia,\" he whispered, \"you are an admirable actress. 'O wonderful,\nwonderful, and most wonderful wonderful! and yet again wonderful, and after\nthat out of all whooping!\"\n\nThe Baroness smiled.\n\n\"And it is now time,\" said his Highness, \"for me to appeal to your better\nnature. I shall do so in a rather loud voice, for I have prepared a most\nvirtuous homily that I am unwilling the Grand Duchess should miss. You\nwill at its conclusion be overcome with an appropriate remorse, and will\nobligingly burst into tears, and throw yourself at my feet--pray remember\nthat the left is the gouty one,--and be forgiven. You will then be restored\nto favor, while de Ch\u00e2teauroux drives off alone and in disgrace. Your plan\nworks wonderfully.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" the Baroness doubtfully said, \"such was the plan.\"\n\n\"And a magnificent one,\" said the Grand Duke.\n\n\"But I have altered it, your Highness.\"\n\n\"And this alteration, Amalia--?\"\n\n\"Involves a trip to Vienna.\"\n\n\"Not yet, Amalia. We must wait.\"\n\n\"Oh, I could never endure delays,\" said the Baroness, \"and, since you\ncannot accompany me, I am going with Monsieur de Ch\u00e2teauroux.\"\n\nThe Grand Duke grasped the carriage door.\n\n\"Preposterous!\" he cried.\n\n\"But you have given your consent,\" the Baroness protested, \"and in the\npresence of the Grand Duchess.\"\n\n\"Which,\" said the Grand Duke, \"was part of our plan.\"\n\n\"Indeed, your Highness,\" said the Baroness, \"it was a most important part.\nYou must know,\" she continued, with some diffidence, \"that I have the\nmisfortune to love Monsieur de Ch\u00e2teauroux.\"\n\n\"Who is in love with Victoria.\"\n\n\"I have the effrontery to believe,\" said the Baroness, \"that he is, in\nreality, in love with me.\"\n\n\"Especially after hearing him last night,\" the Grand Duke suggested.\n\n\"That scene, your Highness, we had carefully rehearsed--oh, seven or eight\ntimes! Personally, I agreed with your Highness that the quotation from\nTheocritus was pedantic, but Philippe insisted on it, you conceive--\"\n\nThe Grand Duke gazed meditatively upon the Baroness, who had the grace to\nblush.\n\n\"Then it was,\" he asked, \"a comedy for my benefit?\"\n\n\"You would never have consented--\" she began. But the Grand Duke's\ncountenance, which was slowly altering to a greenish pallor, caused her to\npause.\n\n\"You will get over it in a week, Louis,\" she murmured, \"and you will find\nother--baronesses.\"\n\n\"Oh, very probably!\" said his Highness, and he noted with pleasure that he\nspoke quite as if it did not matter. \"Nevertheless, this was a despicable\ntrick to play upon the Grand Duchess.\"\n\n\"Yet I do not think the Grand Duchess will complain,\" said the Baroness von\nAltenburg.\n\nAnd it was as though a light broke on the Grand Duke. \"You planned all this\nbeforehand?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Why, precisely, your Highness.\"\n\n\"And de Ch\u00e2teauroux helped you?\"\n\n\"In effect, yes, your Highness.\"\n\n\"And the Grand Duchess knew?\"\n\n\"The Grand Duchess suggested it, your Highness, the moment that she knew\nyou thought of eloping.\"\n\n\"And I, who tricked Gaston--!\"\n\n\"Louis,\" said the Baroness von Altenburg, in a semi-whisper, \"your wife\nis one of those persons who cling to respectability like a tippler to his\nbottle. To her it is absolutely nothing how many women you may pursue--or\nconquer--so long as you remain here under her thumb, to be exhibited, in\nfair sobriety, upon the necessary public occasions. I pity you, my Louis.\"\nAnd she sighed with real compassion.\n\nHe took possession of one gloved hand. \"At the bottom of your heart,\" his\nHighness said, irrelevantly, \"you like me better than you do Monsieur de\nCh\u00e2teauroux.\"\n\n\"I find you the more entertaining company, to be sure--But what a woman\nmost wants is to be loved. If I touch Philippe's hand for, say, the\nmillionth part of a second longer than necessity compels, he treads for the\nremainder of the day above meteors; if yours--why, you at most admire my\nfingers. No doubt you are a connoisseur of fingers and such-like trifles;\nbut, then, a woman does not wish to be admired by a connoisseur so much as\nshe hungers to be adored by a maniac. And accordingly, I prefer my stupid\nPhilippe.\"\n\n\"You are wise,\" the Grand Duke estimated, \"I remember long ago ... in\nPoictesme yonder....\"\n\n\"I loathe her,\" the Bareness said, with emphasis. \"Nay, I am ignorant as to\nwho she was--but O my Louis! had you accorded me a tithe of the love you\nsquandered on that abominable dairymaid I would have followed you not only\nto Vienna--\"\n\nHe raised his hand, \"There are persons yonder in whom the proper emotions\nare innate; let us not shock them. No, I never loved you, I suppose; I\nmerely liked your way of talking, liked your big green eyes, liked your\nlithe young body.... H\u00e9, and I like you still, Amalia. So I shall not play\nthe twopenny despot. God be with you, my dear.\"\n\nHe had seen tears in those admirable eyes before he turned his back to her.\n\"Monsieur de Ch\u00e2teauroux,\" he called, \"I find the lady is adamant. I wish\nyou a pleasant journey.\" He held open the door of the carriage for de\nCh\u00e2teauroux to enter.\n\n\"You will forgive us, your Highness?\" asked the latter.\n\n\"You will forget?\" murmured the Baroness.\n\n\"I shall do both,\" said the Grand Duke. \"Bon voyage, mes enfants!\"\n\nAnd with a cracking of whips the carriage drove off.\n\n\"Victoria,\" said the plump little Grand Duke, in admiration, \"you are a\nremarkable woman. I think that I will walk for a while in the gardens, and\nmeditate upon the perfections of my wife.\"\n\n\nVIII\n\nHe strolled in the direction of the woods. As he reached the summit of\na slight incline he turned and looked toward the road that leads from\nBreschau to Vienna. A cloud of dust showed where the carriage had\ndisappeared.\n\n\"Ma foi!\" said his Highness; \"my wife has very fully proven her executive\nability. Beyond doubt, there is no person in Europe better qualified to\nrule Noumaria as Regent.\"\n\n\n\n\nLOVE'S ALUMNI: THE AFTERPIECE\n\n\n_As Played at Ingilby, October 6, 1755_\n\n\"_Though marriage be a lottery, in which there are a wondrous many blanks,\nyet there is one inestimable lot, in which the only heaven on earth is\nwritten.

GEORGE ERWYN, DUCHESS OF ORMSKIRK, DUCHESSE DE PUYSANGE, LADY HUMPHREY\nDEGGE, MRS. AUDAINE, and MRS. ERWYN.\n\n\nSCENE\n\nThe library, and afterward the dining-room, of Ormskirk's home at Ingilby,\nin Westmoreland.\n\n\n\n\nLOVE'S ALUMNI\n\n\n_PROEM:-Wherein a Prince Serves His People_\n\nThe Grand Duke did not return to breakfast nor to dinner, nor, in point of\nfact, to Noumaria. For the second occasion Louis de Soyecourt had vanished\nat the spiriting of boredom; and it is gratifying to record that his\nevasion passed without any train of turmoil.\n\nThe Grand Duchess seemed to disapprove of her bereavement, mildly, but only\nsaid, \"Well, after all--!\"\n\nShe saw to it that the ponds about the palace were dragged conscientiously,\nand held an interview with the Chief of Police, and more lately had herself\ndeclared Regent of Noumaria.\n\nShe proved a capable and popular ruler, who when she began to take lovers\nallowed none of them to meddle with politics: so all went well enough in\nNoumaria, and nobody evinced the least desire to hasten either the maturity\nof young Duke Anthony or the reappearance of his father.\n\n\nI\n\nMeantime had come to Ingilby, the Duke of Ormskirk's place in Westmoreland,\na smallish blue-eyed vagabond who requested audience with his Grace, and\npresently got it, for the Duke, since his retirement from public affairs,\n[Footnote: He returned to office during the following year, as is well\nknown, immediately before the attempted assassination of the French King,\nin the January of 1757.] had become approachable by almost any member of\nthe public.\n\nThe man came Into the library, smiling, \"I entreat your pardon, Monsieur\nle Duc,\" he began, \"that I have not visited you sooner. But in unsettled\ntimes, you comprehend, the master of a beleaguered fortress is kept busy.\nThis poor fortress of my body has been of late most resolutely besieged by\npoverty and hunger, the while that I have been tramping about Europe--in\nsearch of Gaston. Now, they tell me, he is here.\"\n\nThe travesty of their five-year-old interview at Bellegarde so tickled\nOrmskirk's fancy that he laughed heartily. \"Damiens,\" said Ormskirk, to the\nattendant lackey, \"go fetch me a Protestant minister from Manneville, and\nhave a gallows erected in one of the drawing-rooms. I intend to pay off an\nold score.\" Meantime he was shaking the little vagabond's hand, chuckling\nand a-beam with hospitality.\n\n\"Your Grace--!\" said Damiens, bewildered.\n\n\"Well, go, in any event,\" said Ormskirk. \"Oh, go anywhere, man!--to the\ndevil, for instance.\"\n\nHis eyes, followed the retreating lackey. \"As I suspect in the end you\nwill,\" Ormskirk said, inconsequently. \"Still, you are a very serviceable\nfellow, my good Damiens. I have need of you.\"\n\nAnd with a shrug he now began, \"Your Highness,--\"\n\n\"Praise God, no!\" observed the other, fervently.\n\nAnd Ormskirk nodded his comprehension. \"Monsieur de Soyecourt, then. Of\ncourse, we heard of your disappearance, I have been expecting something of\nthe sort for years. And,--frankly, politics are often a nuisance, as both\nGaston and myself will willingly attest,--especially,\" he added, with a\ngrimace, \"since war between France and England became inevitable through\nthe late happenings in India and Nova Scotia, and both our wives flatly\ndeclined to let either of us take part therein,--for fear we might catch\nour death of cold by sleeping in those draughty tents. Faith, you have\ndescended, sir, like an agreeable meteor, upon two of the most scandalously\nhenpecked husbands in all the universe. In fact, you will not find a\ngentleman at Ingilby--save Mr. Erwyn, perhaps--but is an abject slave to\nhis wife, and in consequence most abjectly content.\"\n\n\"You have guests, then?\" said de Soyecourt. \"_Ma foi_, it is unfortunate. I\nbut desired to confer with Gaston concerning the disposal of Beaujolais and\nmy other properties in France since I find that the sensation of hunger,\nwhile undoubtedly novel, is, when too long continued, apt to grow tiresome.\nI would not willingly intrude, however--\"\n\n\"Were it not for the fact that you are wealthy, and yet, so long as you\npreserve your incognito, and remain legally dead, you cannot touch a penny\nof your fortune! The situation is droll. We must arrange it. Meanwhile\nyou are my guest, and I can assure you that at Ingilby you will be to all\nMonsieur de Soyecourt, no more and no less. Now let us see what can be done\nabout clothing Monsieur de Soyecourt for dinner--\"\n\n\"But I could not consider--\" Monsieur de Soyecourt protested.\n\n\"I must venture to remind you,\" the Duke retorted, \"that dinner is almost\nready, and that Claire is the sort of housewife who would more readily\ncondone fratricide or arson than cold soup.\"\n\n\"It is odd,\" little de Soyecourt said, with complete irrelevance, \"that in\nthe end I should get aid of you and of Gaston. And it is odd you should be\nforgiving my bungling attempts at crime, so lightly--\"\n\nOrmskirk considered, a new gravity in his plump face. \"Faith, but we find\nit more salutary, in looking back, to consider some peccadilloes of our\nown. And we bear no malice, Gaston and I,--largely, I suppose, because\ncontentment is a great encourager of all the virtues. Then, too, we\nremember that to each of us, at the eleventh hour, and through no merit of\nhis own, was given the one thing worth while in life. We did not merit it;\nfew of us merit anything, for few of us are at bottom either very good or\nvery bad. Nay, my friend, for the most part we are blessed or damned as\nFate elects, and hence her favorites may not in reason contemn her victims.\nFor myself, I observe the king upon his throne and the thief upon his\ncoffin, in passage for the gallows; and I pilfer my phrase and I apply it\nto either spectacle: _There, but for the will of God, sits John Bulmer_. I\nmay not understand, I may not question; I can but accept. Now, then, let us\nprepare for dinner\" he ended, in quite another tone.\n\nDe Soyecourt yielded. He was shown to his rooms, and Ormskirk rang for\nDamiens, whom the Duke was sending into France to attend to a rather\nimportant assassination.\n\n\nII\n\nAt dinner Louis de Soyecourt made divers observations.\n\nFirst Gaston had embraced him. \"And the de G\u00e2tinais estates?--but beyond\nquestion, my dear Louis! Next week we return to France, and the affair is\neasily arranged. You may abdicate in due form, you need no longer skulk\nabout Europe disguised as a piano-tuner; it is all one to France, you\nconceive, whether you or your son reign in Noumaria. You should have come\nto me sooner. As for your having been in love with my wife, I could not\nwell quarrel with that, since the action would seriously reflect upon my\nown taste, who am still most hideously in love with her.\"\n\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne had stoutened. Monsieur de Soyecourt noted also that H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's gold\nhair was silvering now, as though Time had tangled cobwebs through it, and\nthat Gaston was profoundly unconscious of the fact. In Gaston's eyes she\nwas at the most seventeen. Well, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne had always been admirable in her\nmanagement of all, and it would be diverting to see that youngest child of\nhers.... Meanwhile it was diverting also to observe how conscientiously she\nwas exerting a good influence over Gaston: and de Soyecourt smiled to find\nthat she shook her head at Gaston's third glass, and that de Puysange did\nnot venture on a fourth. Victoria, to do her justice, had never meddled\nwith any of her husband's vices....\n\nAs for the Duchess of Ormskirk, Louis de Soyecourt had known from the\nbeginning--in comparative youthfulness,--that Claire would placidly order\nher portion of the world as she considered expedient, and that Ormskirk\nwould travesty her, and somewhat bewilder her, and that in the ultimate\nOrmskirk would obey her to the letter.\n\nCaptain Audaine Monsieur de Soyecourt considered at the start diverting,\nand in the end a pompous bore. Yet they assured him that Audaine was\ngetting on prodigiously in the House of Commons, [Footnote: The Captain's\npersonal quarrel with the Chevalier St. George and its remarkable upshot,\nat Antwerp, as well as the Captain's subsequent renunciation of Jacobitism,\nare best treated of in Garendon's own memoirs.]--as, _ma foi_! he would\nmost naturally do, since his _m\u00e9tier_ was simply to shout well-rounded\ncommon-places,--and the circumstance that he shouted would always attract\nattention, while the fact that he shouted platitudes would invariably\nprevent his giving offence. Lord Humphrey Degge was found a ruddy and\ncomely person, of no especial importance, but de Soyecourt avidly took note\nof Mr. Erwyn's waistcoat. Why, this man was a genius! Monsieur de Soyecourt\nat first glance decided. Staid, demure even, yet with a quiet prodigality\nof color and ornament, an inevitableness of cut--Oh, beyond doubt, this man\nwas a genius!\n\nAs for the ladies at Ingilby, they were adjudged to be handsome women,\none and all, but quite unattractive, since they evinced not any excessive\ninterest in Monsieur de Soyecourt. Here was no sniff of future conquest,\nnot one side-long glance, but merely three wives unblushingly addicted to\ntheir own husbands. _Eh bien_! these were droll customs!\n\nYet in the little man woke a vague suspicion, as he sat among these\ncontented folk, that, after all, they had perhaps attained to something\nvery precious of which his own life had been void, to a something of which\nhe could not even form a conception. Love, of course, he understood, with\nthoroughness; no man alive had loved more ardently and variously than\nLouis de Soyecourt. But what the devil! love was a temporary delusion, an\ningenious device of Nature's to bring about perpetuation of the species.\nIt was a pleasurable insanity which induced you to take part in a rather\npreposterously silly and undignified action: and once this action was\nperformed, the insanity, of course, gave way to mutual tolerance, or to\ndislike, or, more preferably, as de Soyecourt considered, to a courteous\noblivion of the past.\n\nAnd yet when this Audaine, to cite one instance only, had vented some\nparticularly egregious speech that exquisite wife of his would merely\nsmile, in a fond, half-musing way. She had twice her husband's wit, and\nwas cognizant of the fact, beyond doubt; to any list of his faults and\nweaknesses you could have compiled she indubitably might have added a dozen\nitems, familiar to herself alone: and with all this, it was clamant that\nshe preferred Audaine to any possible compendium of the manly virtues. Why,\nin comparison, she would have pished at a seraph!--after five years of his\ntwaddle, mark you. And H\u00e9l\u00e8ne seemed to be really not much more sensible\nabout Gaston....\n\nIt all was quite inexplicable. Yet Louis de Soyecourt could see that not\none of these folk was blind to his or her yoke-fellow's frailty, but that,\nbeside this something very precious to which they had attained, and\nhe had never attained, a man's foible, or a woman's defect, dwindled\ninto insignificance. Here, then, were people who, after five years'\nconsortment,--consciously defiant of time's corrosion, of the guttering-out\nof desire, of the gross and daily disillusions of a life in common,\nand even of the daily fret of all trivialities shared and diversely\nviewed,--who could yet smile and say: \"No, my companion is not quite the\nperfect being I had imagined. What does it matter? I am content. I would\nhave nothing changed.\"\n\nWell, but Victoria had not been like that. She let you go to the devil in\nyour own way, without meddling, but she irritated you all the while by\nholding herself to a mark. She had too many lofty Ideas about her own\nduties and principles,--much such uncompromising fancies as had led his\nfather to get rid of that little Nelchen.... No, there was no putting up\nwith these rigid virtues, day in and day out. These high-flown notions\nabout right and wrong upset your living, they fretted your luckless\nassociates.... These people here at Ingilby, by example, made no\npretensions to immaculacy; instead, they kept their gallant compromise\nwith imperfection; and they seemed happy enough....

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email\ncontact links and up to date contact information can be found at the\nFoundation's web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
