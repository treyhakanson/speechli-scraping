The Beggar And The Grail\n\n\n\n\nWHO WAS KING ARTHUR?\n\nKing Arthur, who held sway in Camelot with his Knights of the Round\nTable, was supposedly a king of Britain hundreds of years ago. Most of\nthe stories about him are probably not historically true, but there\nwas perhaps a real king named Arthur, or with a name very much like\nArthur, who ruled somewhere in the island of Britain about the sixth\ncentury.\n\nAmong the romantic spires and towers of Camelot, King Arthur held\ncourt with his queen, Guinevere. According to tradition, he received\nmortal wounds in battling with the invading Saxons, and was carried\nmagically to fairyland to be brought back to health and life.\nExcalibur was the name of King Arthur's sword--in fact, it was the\nname of two of his swords. One of these tremendous weapons Arthur\npulled from the stone in which it was imbedded, after all other\nknights had failed. This showed that Arthur was the proper king. The\nother Excalibur was given to Arthur by the Lady of the Lake--she\nreached her hand above the water, as told in the story, and gave the\nsword to the king. When Arthur was dying, he sent one of his Knights\nof the Round Table, Sir Bedivere, to throw the sword back into the\nlake from which he had received it.\n\nThe Knights of the Round Table were so called because they customarily\nsat about a huge marble table, circular in shape. Some say that\nthirteen knights could sit around that table; others say that as many\nas a hundred and fifty could find places there. There sat Sir Galahad,\nwho would one day see the Holy Grail. Sir Gawain was there, nephew of\nKing Arthur. Sir Percivale, too, was to see the Holy Grail. Sir\nLancelot--Lancelot of the Lake, who was raised by that same Lady of\nthe Lake who gave Arthur his sword--was the most famous of the Knights\nof the Round Table. He loved Queen Guinevere.\n\nAll the knights were sworn to uphold the laws of chivalry--to go to\nthe aid of anyone in distress, to protect women and children, to fight\nhonorably, to be pious and loyal to their king.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nAllan Finds A Champion\n\n\n\"I cannot carry your message, Sir Knight.\"\n\nQuiet-spoken was the lad, though his heart held a moment's fear as,\nscowling and menacing, the knight who sat so easily the large horse,\nflamed fury at his refusal.\n\n\"And why can you not? It is no idle play, boy, to flaunt Sir\nPellimore. Brave knights have found the truth of this at bitter cost.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, Sir Knight, you must needs find another message bearer.\nI am page to Sir Percival and he would deem it no service to him\nshould I bear a strange knights message.\"\n\n\"Then, by my faith, you shall learn your lesson. Since you are but a\nyouth it would prove but poor sport to thrust my sword through your\nworthless body. Yet shall I find Sir Percival and make him pay for the\nboorishness of his page. In the meantime, take you this.\"\n\nWith a sweep the speaker brought the flat side of his sword down. But,\nif perchance, he thought that the boy would await the blow he found\nsurprise for that worthy skillfully evaded the weapon's downward\nthrust.\n\nNow then was Sir Pellimore doubly wroth.\n\n\"Od's zounds, and you need a trouncing. And so shall I give it you,\nelse my dignity would not hold its place.\" Suiting action to word the\nknight reared his horse, prepared to bring the boy to earth.\n\nIt might hare gone ill with Allan but for the appearance at the turn\nof the road of another figure--also on horseback. The new knight\nperceiving trouble, rode forward.\n\n\"What do we see here?\" he questioned. \"Sir Knight, whose name I do not\nknow, it seems to me that you are in poor business to quarrel with so\nyouthful a foe. What say you?\"\n\n\"As to with whom I quarrel is no concern of anyone but myself. I can,\nhowever, to suit the purpose, change my foe. Such trouncing as I wish\nto give this lad I can easily give to you, Sir Knight, and you wish\nit?\"\n\n\"You can do no more than try. It may not be so easy as your boasting\nwould seeming indicate. Lad,\" and the newcomer turned to the boy, \"why\ndoes this arrogant knight wish you harm?\"\n\n\"He would have me carry a message, a challenge to Sir Kay, and that I\ncannot do, for even now I bear a message from Sir Percival, whose page\nI am but yesterday become. And I must hold true to my own lord and\nliege.\"\n\n\"True words and well spoken. And so for you, Sir Knight of the\narrogant tongue, I hope your weapon speaks equally well. Prepare you,\nsir.\"\n\nSir Pellimore laughed loudly and disdainfully.\n\n\"I call this great fortune which brings me battle with you, sir, who\nare unknown but who I hope, none the less, are a true and brave\nknight.\"\n\nThe next second the two horses crashed together. Sir Pellimore soon\nproved his skill. The Unknown, equally at ease, contented himself with\nmeeting onslaught after onslaught, parrying clever thrusts and wicked\nblows. So they battled for many an hour.\n\nAllan, the boy, with eyes glistening, waited to see the outcome of the\nbrave fight. The Unknown, his champion, perhaps would need his aid\nthrough some dire misfortune and he was prepared.\n\nNow the Unknown changed his method from one of defense to one of\noffense. But Sir Pellimore was none the less skillful. The third\ncharge of his foe he met so skillfully that both horses crashed to the\nground. On foot, the two men then fought--well and long. Until,\nthrough inadvertence, the Unknown's foot slipped and the next moment\nfound his shield splintered and sword broken.\n\n\"Now then, by my guardian saint, you are truly vanquished,\" Sir\nPellimore exclaimed exultantly. \"Say you so?\"\n\nBut the Unknown had already hurled himself, weaponless, upon the\nseeming victor and seizing him about the waist with mighty strength,\nhurled him to the ground. And even as the fallen knight, much shaken,\nprepared to arise, lo, Merlin the Wizard appeared and cast him into a\ndeep sleep.\n\n\"Sire,\" the Wizard declared, \"do you indeed run many dangers that thy\nstation should not warrant. And yet, I know not whether we, your loyal\nsubjects, would have it otherwise.\"\n\nNow Allan, the boy, realized he was in the presence of the great King.\nHe threw himself upon his knees.\n\n\"Rise lad,\" said King Arthur kindly. \"Sir Percival is indeed fortunate\nto have a page, who while so young, yet is so loyal. So shall we see\nyou again. Kind Merlin,\" and the King turned to the Wizard, \"awaken\nyou this sleeping knight whose only sin seems an undue amount of\nsurliness and arrogance, which his bravery and strength more than\noffset.\"\n\nNow Sir Pellimore rubbed his eyes. \"Where am I?\" he muttered drowsily.\nThen as realization came, he sprang to his feet.\n\n\"Know you then, Sir Pellimore,\" said Merlin, \"he with whom you fought\nis none other than Arthur, the King.\"\n\nThe knight stood motionless, dumbfounded. But only for a moment.\n\n\"If so, then am I prepared for such punishment as may come. But be it\nwhat it may, I can say this, that none with whom I fought has had more\nskill or has shown greater bravery and chivalry. And more than that\nnone can say.\"\n\nAnd the knight bowed low his head, humbly and yet with a touch of\npride.\n\n\"Thou art a brave knight, Sir Pellimore. And to us it seems, that\naside from a hasty temper, thou couldst well honor us by joining the\nKnights of the Round Table. What saith thou?\"\n\n\"That shall I gladly do. And here and now I pledge my loyalty to none\nother than Arthur, King of Britain, and to my fellow knights. And as\nfor you, boy, I say it now--that my harsh tongue and temper ill became\nthe true knight I claim to be.\"\n\n\"Brave words, Sir Pellimore,\" said the King. \"So let us back to the\ncastle. We see that Merlin is already ill at ease.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nAllan Goes Forth\n\n\nSo then the four, the good King, Sir Pellimore, Merlin the Wizard, and\nAllan, page to Sir Percival, came to the great castle of Britain's\nking.\n\nArthur led them into the great hall in which were placed many small\ntables and in the center of them all was one of exceeding size and\nround. Here was to be found a place for Sir Pellimore but though the\nKing searched long, few seats did he find which were not bespoken. Yet\nfinally he found one which did well for the new arrival.\n\n\"Here then shall you find your place at the Round Table, good knight,\"\nsaid the King. \"And we trust that you will bring renown and honor to\nyour fellowship, succor to those who are in need and that always will\nyou show true chivalry. And we doubt not but you will do all of\nthese.\"\n\nSir Pellimore bowed low his head nor did he make reply because within\nhim surged a great feeling of gratitude.\n\nThe King turned away and Merlin followed him to the upraised dais. So\nnow the two seated themselves and joined in earnest talk.\n\nAt the door, Allan had waited, for he would not depart until His\nMajesty had seated himself. A strange gladness was in the boy's heart,\nfor had not his King fought for him? Here in this court, he too would\nfind adventure. Sir Percival mayhap, some day, would dub him knight,\nshould he prove faithful and worthy. What greater glory could there be\nthan to fight for such a King and with such brave men?\n\n\"But I must be off,\" he suddenly bethought himself, \"else Sir Percival\nwill not be pleased.\" And therewith, he made great haste to depart.\n\n\"Aye, sire,\" Merlin was now speaking, \"my dream is indeed weighted\nwith importance. But by the same taken, it cannot be known until you\ncall your court together so that it may be heard by all.\"\n\n\"Then mean you, kind Merlin, that we must call not only those of the\nRound Table but all other knights and even pages and squires?\"\n\n\"Even so, sire. And yet, since Whitsunday is but a few days away, that\nshould be no hard matter. For the knights of your court, except Sir\nLauncelot and Sir Gawaine are here, prepared for such tourneys and\nfeasts fit to celebrate that day.\"\n\n\"So then shall it be. Even now our heralds shall announce that we\ncrave the attendance of all those who pledge loyalty to our court. For\nI know well that they must be of no mean import, these things we shall\nhear. We pray only that they shall be for our good fortune.\"\n\nThe Wizard, making no reply, bent low and kissed his King's hand. Then\nhe departed.\n\nCame now his herald whom the King had summoned.\n\n\"See to it that our court assembles this time tomorrow. Make far and\ndistant outcry so that all who are within ear may hear and so hurry to\nour call. And mark you this well. We would hare Sir Launcelot and our\nown nephew, Sir Gawaine, present even though they departed this early\nmorn for Cornwall. See you to it.\"\n\nSwiftly the herald made for the door to carry out the commands of his\nKing. But even as he reached it, Arthur called again to him.\n\n\"We have a fancy, good herald, we fain would have you follow. Ask then\nSir Percival to let us have the services of his page who seems a\nlikely youth and bid this youth go hence after the two absent knights,\nSir Gawaine and Sir Launcelot and give to them our message, beseeching\ntheir return. Tell not the boy it is we who have asked that he go.\"\n\n\"It shall be done as you will, sire,\" replied the herald. No surprise\ndid he show at the strangeness of the King's command for long had he\nbeen in his service and well he knew the King's strange fancies.\n\nSir Percival gave ready consent, when found. So when the boy had\nreturned from the errand forespoken, the herald announced that he must\nhasten after the two knights and bid them return.\n\n\"And by my faith, lad, you have but little time and you must speed\nwell. For tomorrow at this time is this conclave called, and the two\nknights are already many miles on their journey. Take you this horse\nand hasten.\"\n\nThen, as the eager youth, quick pulsed, made haste to obey, the herald\nadded in kindly voice: \"It would be well could you succeed, lad. For\nit is often true that through such missions, newcomers prove future\nworthiness for knighthood.\"\n\n\"I thank you greatly for your kindness,\" replied the boy. \"I can but\ntry to the uttermost. No rest shall I have until I meet with the two\nknights.\"\n\nSo now Allan sought out and bespoke his own lord.\n\n\"I wish you well, Allan,\" said Sir Percival. \"And say you to my\nfriends Launcelot and Gawaine should they prove reluctant that they\nwill favor their comrade, Sir Percival, if they would make haste and\nhurry their return. Stop not to pick quarrel nor to heed any call,\nurgent though it may seem. Prove my true page and worthy.\"\n\n\"I shall do my very best, my lord. And, this my first commission,\nshall prove successful even though to make it so, I perish.\"\n\nSwiftly now rode forth the boyish figure. Well, too, had Arthur\nchosen. Came a day when, than Allan, no braver, truer knight there\nwas. But of that anon.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nA Combat\n\n\n\"Good Launcelot, I trust that good fortune shall be with us and that\nour adventures be many and the knights we meet bold and brave.\"\n\n\"Of that, Gawaine, we need have no fear. For adventure ever follows\nwhere one seeks and often enough overtakes the seeker. Let us rather\nhope that we shall find Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadian, both of\nCornwall. For myself I would joust with Sir Tristram than whom braver\nand bolder knight does not live.\"\n\n\"And as for me,\" spoke Gawaine, \"my anxiety is to see Mark, the king\nof Cornwall, and tell him to his face that I deem him a scurvy hound\nsince he promised protection to Beatrice of Banisar as she passed\nthrough his lands and yet broke his promise and so holds her for\nransom.\"\n\n\"And there shall I help you, dear Gawaine. For bitterly shall Mark rue\nhis unknightly act. Shall I even wait for my event with Sir Tristram\nuntil your business is done.\"\n\n\"Aye, and gladly will Sir Tristram wait, I wot, if he deems it honor\nto meet with Sir Launcelot du Lake. For no knight there is who doth\nnot know of your prowess and repute, Sir Tristram least of all.\"\n\n\"Kind words, Gawaine, for which I thank you. Yet, if I mistake not,\nyonder, adventure seems to wait. And we but a little more than two\nscore miles from our gates.\"\n\nAhead of them and barring their way were ten knights. Launcelot and\nGawaine stopped not a moment their pace but rode boldly forward.\n\n\"And wherefor do you, strange Knights, dispute our passage?\" asked Sir\nGawaine.\n\n\"Safely may you both pass unless you be gentlemen of King Arthur's\ncourt,\" quote the leader who stepped forward to answer.\n\n\"And what if we be, Sir Knight?\" replied Sir Launcelot mildly.\n\n\"And if you be then must you battle to the uttermost. For we owe\nloyalty to King Ryence who is enemy of King Arthur. Therefore, are we\nhis enemies too, and enemies also of all of King Arthur's subjects.\nAnd thus, we flaunt our enmity. We here and now call King Arthur an\nupstart and if you be of his court you cannot do aught else but fight\nwith us.\"\n\n\"Keep you your words,\" said Sir Gawaine, \"until we have ceased our\nquarrel. Then if you will you may call Arthur any names. Prepare you.\"\n\nBoldly Sir Launcelot and Sir Gawaine charged upon the foe. Nor did the\nknights who met them know who these two were, else milder were their\ntone. Such was the valor of the two and such their strength that four\nmen were thrown from their horses in that first attack and of these\ntwo were grievously wounded.\n\nTogether and well they fought. Easily did they withstand the men of\nKing Ryence. Four men were slain by their might, through wondrous and\nfearful strokes, and four were sorely wounded. There lay the four\nagainst an oaken tree where they had been placed in a moment's lull.\nBut two knights were left to oppose Launcelot and Gawaine but these\ntwo were gallant men and worthy, the very best of all the ten.\n\nSo they fought again each with a single foe. Hard pressed were the two\nmen of King Ryence, yet stubbornly they would not give way. And as\neach side gave blow for blow, so each called \"for Arthur\" or \"for\nRyence,\" whichever the case might be. Many hours they fought until at\nlast Sir Launcelot by a powerful blow crashed both foe and foe's horse\nto the ground.\n\nAnd as the other would further combat, though exceedingly weak, Sir\nLauncelot, upraised lance in hand by a swift stroke smote sword from\nout of his weakened grasp.\n\n\"Thou art a brave knight, friend. And having fought so well, I ask no\nfurther penance but this, that you do now declare King Arthur no\nupstart. I care not for your enmity but I will abide no slander.\"\n\n\"So must I then declare, since you have proven better man than I,\"\ndeclared the conquered knight. \"And for your leniency I owe you\nthanks. Wherefore then to whom am I grateful? I pray your name?\"\n\n\"That I shall not tell until I hear your own,\" replied Launcelot.\n\n\"I am known as Ronald de Lile,\" the other replied in subdued tone.\n\n\"Truly and well have I heard of you as a brave knight,\" was the reply,\n\"and now I know it to be so. I am Sir Launcelot du Lake.\"\n\n\"Then indeed is honor mine and glory, too. For honor it is to succumb\nto Sir Launcelot.\"\n\nBut now both heard the voice of Gawaine. Weak had he grown, but weaker\nstill his foe. Gawaine had brought the other to earth at last with\nswift and mighty blow and such was the force of his stroke the fallen\nman could not rise although he made great ado so to do.\n\n\"So must I yield,\" this knight declared. \"Now will I admit Arthur no\nupstart, but though I die for it I do declare no greater king than\nRyence ever lived.\"\n\n\"By my faith, your words are but such as any knight must hold of his\nown sovereign prince. I cannot take offense at brave words, Sir\nKnight. Now, give me your name, for you are strong and worthy.\"\n\n\"I am Marvin, brother of him who fought with your comrade. And never\nhave we met bolder and greater knights.\"\n\n\"I am Gawaine and he who fought your brother is none other than\nLauncelot.\"\n\n\"Then truly have we met no mean foes,\" replied the other.\n\nConquered and conquerers now turned to make the wounded as comfortable\nas they well could be. After which, our two knights debated going on\ntheir journey or tarrying where they were until the morn.\n\n\"Let us wend our way until we find fit place for food and rest. There\ncan we tarry.\" So spoke Launcelot and the other agreed.\n\nThen they took leave of Sir Marvin and Sir Ronald and so on their way.\nNot many miles did they go however before they found suitable place.\nLate was the hour and weary and much in need of rest were the two\nknights. So they slept while, half his journey covered, Allan sped\nonward, making fast time because he was but light of weight and his\nhorse exceeding swift.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\nAllan Meets the Knights\n\n\nFrom the first day when Allan began to understand the tales of\nchivalry and knightly deeds, he fancied and longed for the day when he\nwould grow into manhood and by the same token into knighthood. Then\nwould he go unto King Arthur on some Pentecost and crave the boon of\nserving him. Mayhap, too, he would through brave and worthy deeds\ngain seat among those of the Round Table. So he would dream, this\nyouth with eager eyes, and his father, Sir Gaunt, soon came to know of\nhis son's fancies and was overly proud and pleased with them. For he\nhimself had, in his days, been a great and worthy knight, of many\nadventures and victor of many an onslaught. It pleased him that son of\nhis would follow in his footsteps.\n\nWhen Allan was fourteen, Sir Gaunt proceeded to Sir Percival who was\ngreat friend of his and bespoke for his son the place of page. And so\nto please Sir Gaunt and for friendship's sake, Sir Percival gave ready\nconsent. Therewith, he found the youth pleasing to the eye and of a\ngreat willingness to serve.\n\nSo must we return to Allan who is now on his way for many an hour. As\nhe made his way, he marveled that he should have had notice brought\nupon himself, for he was young and diffident and should by every token\nhave escaped attention in these his first days at court. How would his\nheart have grown tumultuous had he known that none other than Arthur\nhimself had made him choice. But that he was not to know for many a\nyear.\n\nNight came on and the boy traveled far. Yet gave he no thought to rest\nfor he knew that he could ill afford to tarry and that only with the\nbest of fortune could he overtake the two knights in time to make\nearly return. About him the woods were dark and mysterious. Owls\nhooted now and then and other sounds of the night there were, yet was\nthe boy so filled with urge of his mission that he found not time to\nthink of ghosts nor black magic.\n\nThen, as he turned the road he saw the dim shadow of a horse. Ghostly\nit seemed, until through closer view it proved flesh and blood. Lying\nclose by was a knight who seemed exceeding weak and sorely wounded.\n\nQuick from his horse came Allan and so made the strange knight be of\ngreater comfort.\n\nNow the knight spoke weakly.\n\n\"Grievously have I been dealt with by an outlaw band. This day was I\nto meet my two brothers Sir Ronald and Sir Marvin yet cannot proceed\nfor very weakness. Which way do you go, lad?\"\n\n\"I keep on my way to Cornwall,\" replied Allan.\n\n\"From yonder do my brothers journey and should you meet with them bid\nthem hasten here so that together we can go forth to find this outlaw\nband and it chastise.\"\n\n\"That shall I do. Sir Knight. It grieves me that I may not stay and\ngive you such aid as I may but so must I hasten that I cannot. Yet\nshall I stop at first abode and commission them to hurry here to you.\"\n\n\"For that I thank you, lad. And should time ever come when you my aid\nrequire, know then to call on Philip of Gile.\"\n\nSo Allan pressed forward. At early dawn he came upon Sir Ronald and\nSir Marvin who had found rest along the wayside. And when he found\nthat these were the two knights he gave them their brother's message.\n\n\"Then must we hasten thence, Ronald. And thank you, lad, for bringing\nus this message. Choose you and you can rest awhile and partake of\nsuch food that we have.\"\n\n\"Of food I will have, Sir Knights, for hunger calls most urgently. But\ntarry I cannot for I must find Sir Launcelot and Sir Gawaine. Mayhap\nyou have met with them?\"\n\n\"Of a truth can we say that we have met with them and suffered\nthereby. Yet do we hold proof as to their knightly valor and skill.\nThey have gone but a little way, for it was their purpose to find rest\nnearby. We doubt not you will find them at the first fair abode. In\nthe meantime must we hasten to our brother's aid and leave our wounded\ncomrades to such care as they may get.\"\n\nThe knights spoke truly, for Allan found upon inquiry that the two he\nsought were lodged close by. Boldly the boy called, now for Sir\nLauncelot, now for Sir Gawaine, but both were overtired and of a great\nweariness and it took many minutes before at last Sir Launcelot opened\nwide his eyes.\n\n\"And who are you, boy?\" for he knew him not.\n\n\"My name is Allan and I am page to Sir Percival.\"\n\n\"Come you with a message from Sir Percival? Does he need our help?\"\n\n\"Nay, sir. Rather do I come with a message from the court--the herald\nof which sent me urging you and Sir Gawaine to return before sundown\nfor a great conclave is to gather which the King himself has called.\"\n\n\"Awaken then, thou sleepy knight,\" Sir Launcelot called to his comrade\nwho had not stirred. \"It were pity that all this must be told to you\nagain.\"\n\nSir Gawaine now arose rubbing eyes still filled with sleep. To him\nAllan repeated his message.\n\n\"What say you, Gawaine? Shall we return?\"\n\n\"As for me,\" replied Sir Gawaine, \"I would say no. What matter if we\nare or are not present. Already we are late for our present journey's\npurpose. So say I, let us not return but rather ask this youth to\nbespeak for us the king's clemency.\"\n\n\"And I, too, am of the same mind, Gawaine. So lad,\" Sir Launcelot\nturned to the boy and spoke kindly, \"return you to court and give them\nour message. This errand on which we are at present bound holds urgent\nneed, else would we return at our King's behest.\"\n\nRueful and with a great gloom Allan saw his errand fail.\n\n\"Kind sirs, Sir Percival bid me bespeak for him as well, and ask you,\nas true comrades, to make certain to return. Furthermore, my knights,\nthis, my first mission would be unfortunate if it did not terminate\nsuccessfully. So I pray you that you return.\"\n\nLoud and long Sir Launcelot laughed and yet not unkindly while Sir\nGawaine placed hand upon the boy's shoulder approvingly.\n\n\"By my faith, Launcelot, we can do no more than return. That Percival\nspeaks counts for much, but this youth's honor is also at stake.\" The\nlight of laughter played in the speaker's eyes.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"let us return. It would be pity to send\nthis lad back after his long journey, without success. So then to our\nhorses and let us make haste. The hours are few and the miles many.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\nMerlin's Message\n\n\nNow as the sun, a flaming golden ball about which played the wondrous\nsofter colors of filmy clouds, began sinking in the western horizon,\nthe heralds announced everywhere that the time for assemblage had\ncome. Of those few who were not present, chiefest were Sir Launcelot\nand Sir Gawaine. And for these two the herald of King Arthur was\nsearching the road in vain.\n\n\"Think you, Sir Percival, these two will come?\" the herald, anxious of\ntone, inquired. \"Our King would have them present and I fancy not the\nmaking of excuse for their not appearing.\"\n\n\"It is hard telling, Sir Herald. Far had the page to go and he is\nyoung. Then too, it is a question whether should he meet with them,\nthese two have a mind to appear. For I know that their journey to\nCornwall is urgent.\"\n\nNow the knights entered and found place. Then followed the pages,\nsquires and after them such yeoman and varlets as could find room.\nAfter each had found his place, came King Arthur leading his queen.\nAnd as they entered, up rose the knights, their vassals, all that were\nwithin the hall and raised a mighty shout.\n\n\"St. George and Merrie England. Long live King Arthur. Long live Queen\nGuenever.\"\n\nThen turned the King toward his loyal subjects and though his lips\nwere seen to move, none heard him for the clamor. So King Arthur\nturned to seat his queen and then he himself sat down upon his throne,\nhigh on the dais.\n\nThen soon after even as bell tolled the hour, Arthur arose. No sign\nhad yet come of Launcelot and Gawaine. So now the herald slipped to\nthe door to cast again a hurried glance for perchance that they might\nbe within vision. And as he went noiselessly, so, too, a quiet fell\nthat the King's words might be heard. But now disturbing this quiet\ncame a great clattering. Arthur turned his eyes, frowning, at the\nsudden noise. Yet came a greater turmoil, approaching horse's hoofs\nwere heard and then into the great hall thundered the steeds carrying\nthe noble figures of Launcelot and Gawaine, followed but a pace behind\nby Allan the page.\n\nStraight to the dais they came, the two knights. Allan, however,\nturned, made hasty exit because he felt himself abashed to be observed\nby so many eyes. On foot he entered once again and found place far in\nthe rear where few could observe him.\n\nThe two knights now dismounted and knelt before their King.\n\n\"We pray your pardon for the lateness of our coming. Yet did we\nhasten and could not have come the sooner.\"\n\n\"That we feel is so, Sir Knights, for we know you well enough. Nor are\nwe wroth, since come you did. But where, pray, is the message bearer?\nTruly his speed was great to have reached you in time for your return.\nAnd if I mistake not,\" added the King with great shrewdness, \"neither\nyou, Gawaine, nor you Launcelot, were any too ready to return. How\nthen, did the lad urge you?\"\n\n\"You speak truly, sire,\" replied Gawaine. \"For our errand had need of\nurgent haste and we were both to give it up. Yet did the boy urge us\nand chiefest urge of all to us was where he claimed his own honor\ndemanded the success of his mission. Those were fine words, so did we\ntherefore return.\"\n\n\"Fine words, indeed. Where then is this page? Will you, Sir Herald,\nbring him forth?\"\n\nSo Allan came forward, red of face and hating such womanness that\nwould let him blush before all these great men. Knelt he before his\nKing.\n\n\"Thou art a good lad and will bear watching. Go thy way and remember\nthat the road ahead for those who wish to be knights of high nobility\nis steep and arduous but well worth the trials. Remember too, that\nthis day, Britain's King, said that some day thou wilt prove a worthy\nand brave knight.\"\n\nAnd as Allan with flaming cheeks and glorious pride went to his place\nfar in the rear of the hall the King turned to the assemblage.\n\n\"Merlin is here but departs from us tomorrow for many a day. He has\nhad a great dream which affects this court and us and which must be\ntold to all of you. So he has asked us to call you and this we have\ndone. Stand up now Merlin, wisest of men and truest of counselors.\nSpeak.\"\n\nUp rose Merlin and for wonder as to what his dream might be all held\ntheir breath.\n\n\"But the other night came Joseph of Armathea to me while I slept. And\nhe chided me that in all Britain so few of all the true and brave\nknights had thought to seek the wondrous Holy Grail which once was\npride of all England.\n\n\"And me thought I heard him say, 'Truly do I misdoubt the valor of\nthese knights who seek adventure and glory.'\n\n\"'Yet.' said I, 'doubt not their valor for can I give surety for it.\nFor Holy Grail, every varlet, let alone those of true blood, would\ngive his life and count it more than worthy.'\n\n\"'So shall it be!' replied Sir Joseph. 'For the Holy Grail will be\nfound. Whether knight or varlet shall the finder be, I will not say.\nBut this I tell you now. He who finds it shall be pure of heart and\nnoble beyond all men. From whence he cometh, who he is, I will not\nsay. Remember this, Merlin, brave and noble knights there are now in\nEngland, brave knights shall come, and some shall come as strangely as\nshall the Grail. Many deeds will be done that will bring truest of\nglory to England's name. And never again shall more noble or more\nworthy knights hold Britain's banner so high. For they who seek the\nHoly Grail must be worthy even of the search.'\n\n\"'Let your King beware that he listens well to all who come to his\ncourt on every Pentecost. And though they who search may not be\noverstrong, yet while they seek it they will find in themselves many\nmen's strength.'\n\n\"And then he left me. But even after he was gone I dreamt on. And I\nsay to you, oh men of England, go you forth and seek this Holy Grail,\nif within you, you know that you are pure of heart and noble. If you\nare not, go then and seek to be purified for that is possible. Only\none of you will find the Holy Grail, yet is there great glory in the\nsearch. May he who finds it and all the rest who search for it bring\ngreater fame and worthiness to this our land and to him who is our\nKing.\"\n\nNow Merlin turned to seat himself. But yet before he found his place\nevery man within the hall stood up prepared to make oath then and\nthere to begin the search. Only two kept still, nor did they move. One\nwas Sir Launcelot, the other the youth Allan.\n\nBut quick as they who upstood, Merlin spoke again. And though his\nvoice was low, yet was it heard throughout the hall.\n\n\"Pledge not yourself today, nor yet tomorrow. Go you hence, first. In\nyour innermost heart find answer to this question. Am I pure, am I\nworthy for the search? For that you must be before any pledge\nsuffices.\"\n\nSilent and thoughtful the men found each his seat. And when all had\nbeen seated, Arthur, King, arose.\n\n\"Wouldst that I felt myself worthy. Yet from this day shall I strive\nto the uttermost for the time when I shall feel that I am.\"\n\nAnd throughout the hall came answering vows: \"So shall we all.\" Within\nhis heart, Allan, the youth, felt a strange radiancy, as he too made\nthis vow, \"So shall I.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n\nYosalinde\n\n\nNow came Pentecost and brought with it to King Arthur's Tournament\nbrave knights from everywhere. Distant Normandy, the far shores of\nIreland, sent each the flower of its knighthood. Scotland's king was\nthere, the brave Cadoris, to answer the challenge of the King of\nNorthgalis who was also present. Ban, King of Northumberland, had\ncome. Sir Palomides came too, and it was he who was declared, by many\nto be the bravest and the most skillful of all of Britain's knights.\nYet there were equal number and more who held the same for both Sir\nLauncelot and for Sir Tristram. Sir Lauvecor, leading a hundred\nknights, came late, with the blessing of his father, who was none\nother than King of Ireland.\n\nA brave show they all made, these many knights seeking adventure, and\neach, as he so easily bestrode his steed, found it hard matter to find\ncomrade and friend, for the many who were there. Gay were the colors\neach knight wore and on some fortune had smiled, for these carried\ntoken of some fair lady. Of fair ladies there were many to watch the\ndeeds of skill and bravery and most beautiful of them all, was\nArthur's queen, Guenever.\n\nSir Launcelot and Sir Gawaine had found no need to journey to\nCornwall. For word had come that Sir Tristram had had a bitter quarrel\nwith King Mark and had left his court carrying that wicked King's\ncurse. Tristram had made final demand on the traitorous King to\nrelease the maiden Beatrice whom he was holding for ransom and this\nthe King had had no mind to do. Then had the bold knight himself made\nfor the door of the great dungeon and with hilt of sword knocked long\nand loud to summon the keeper. And when the door was opened this same\nkeeper could not withstay him, nor would he. Then had Tristram carried\nthe maiden to point of safety and so earned her gratitude. Nor would\nany knight of King Mark take issue with him for none felt the King's\ndeed to be knightly. And though the King made pretense of bearing no\nill will, yet did Sir Tristram leave Cornwall that same day.\n\nAnd Sir Gawaine knew not whether to be pleased or otherwise at the\nnews.\n\n\"I would have fancied making rescue of the Lady Beatrice myself. And\nfancied even more to have told King Mark the scurvy knave I deem him;\nyet I doubt not Sir Tristram did the deed well and since it leaves me\nfree to stay and have part in the jousting, I am not displeased.\"\n\n\"And methinks,\" added Sir Launcelot, \"Sir Tristram will make his way\nhither, for tournament such as this holds all alluring call.\"\n\nKing Arthur, together with Ban of Northumberland, and Sir Percival\nwere declared the judges for all but the last of the three days.\n\nNow then Sir Percival, finding a moment's brief respite, followed by\nhis page rode to the palace where sat his mother and two sisters.\nThere he found Sir Uwaine already in deep converse with Helene, who\nwas the older of the two maidens and whose knight he was.\n\n\"See you, son, there do be knights who find time to pay respect to us,\neven though our own are slower footed.\" So spoke the Lady Olande yet\ndid it jestingly and with no intent to hurt for she had great love for\nher son.\n\n\"And I doubt not, Uwaine does make up for any seeming lack of mine,\"\nreplied Sir Percival. \"If, mother mine, I were not made a judge, my\ntime would be more my own.\n\n\"But here, I must have lost what manners I have been taught. Mother,\nthis is Allan who is my page, and these, Allan, are my sisters Helene\nand Yosalinde. Allan is son of Sir Gaunt, whom you all know. Forgive\nmy not making you known before this, lad.\"\n\nPleasantly did the ladies greet him and so well that he found no\nembarrassment therewith. And so now Sir Percival turned and spoke in\nlow tones to his mother. Sir Uwaine and his lady walked away, claiming\nthat they must give greeting to certain high ladies. And therewith\nleft Allan, the boy, and Yosalinde, who was even younger than he, to\nthemselves.\n\nAllan strove to speak but found he could not and so sat on horse\nwaiting. The girl calmly watched him from her place, yet was there\nmischief in her eyes.\n\n\"If you would, you may dismount from your horse and find place hither.\nThere is room, as you see,\" she suggested.\n\nThe lad looked uncertain. Yet Sir Percival had already found place\nnext to his mother and was now in earnest converse. So he found he\ncould not do otherwise.\n\nNow Yosalinde laughed at what showed so plainly his unwillingness to\nsit beside her.\n\n\"I shall not bite you. See how harmless I am? No witch, I hope, you\nthink I am. For shame that youth, who would be brave knight, should\nfear a lady and in especial one so young as I.\"\n\n\"I fear you not,\" replied Allan hotly.\n\n\"Then perhaps you dislike me?\" the minx questioned innocently.\n\n\"Certes, no. How could I?\" the guileless youth replied.\n\n\"Then you do like me? Although I doubt I find any pride in that since\nI must need force the words from you.\"\n\nAt a loss now the lad could not answer. For the girl had better of him\nbecause of her quick tongue and he found she twisted his words and\nmeaning to suit her taste. Yet finally, she turned the talk and so\nAllan found himself telling her of his high hopes. So simply too,\nwithout boasting, he told her of the fine words of Arthur to him. And\nlast, because it had made its deep impress upon him, he spoke of\nMerlin's dream. And of this Yosalinde, now serious and wide eyed,\nquestioned him closely, and soon knew all that he did.\n\nSo now Percival uprose and made ready to return to his duties. So\ntherefore, too, did Allan, and found he now felt more at ease and\nwithout constraint of the girl.\n\n\"I _like_ you, Allan, and I say it though I should make it harder\nfor you to know, than it was for me. I give you my friendship and if\nit help you, take this ring and wear it. May it serve you in time of\nstress. And at all times consider it token of your lady.\"\n\nAnd then once again the laughing, teasing minx, she, added:\n\n\"Yet, after all, you are but a boy and I am no less a girl. Yet, let\nus make-believe, you a bold knight and I your lady. Mayhap it may be\ntrue some day.\"\n\nSo she was gone now to her mother leaving Allan with stirred feelings\nand somewhat in a dream, too. For Sir Percival had to call twice to\nhim before he mounted his own horse. And even as they both made their\nway, he turned his head back to see if he could perceive aught of this\nstrange girl. And thought he saw a waving hand but was not sure.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN\n\nThe Tournament\n\n\nOn the first of the three days of the tournament there were great\nfeats of wrestling and trials of archery. So too did yeomen prove\ntheir skill with mace and clubs. Foot races were many. And constant\nflow of ale and food so that none among the yeomen and even of the\nvarlets found aught to want. Many fools there were too and these\npleased all mightily.\n\nBut as the day advanced of all the yeomen but a half dozen remained\nfor the wrestling. And for each of these but one, there was high\nacclaim from those other yeomen who were there and from such knights\nas owed fealty to selfsame banner. And of the archers too, but very\nfew remained for last tests of skill.\n\nFor the one yeoman, who wore green tunic and red cap, there was none\nto cheer. A stranger, he kept silent and yet was equally skillful with\nthe best. He had entered himself for the archery prize and for the\nwrestling.\n\n\"Dost know this knave?\" asked King Arthur of Sir Percival.\n\n\"Only that he belongs not to any of us of the Round Table,\" replied\nPercival.\n\n\"Is he forsooth one of your men, worthy Ban?\"\n\n\"I would he were, Arthur, yet is he not.\"\n\nNow Sir Percival rode forward and divided these last six wrestlers\ninto teams. Yet did this man prove victor for he had a wondrous hold\nwhich none of the others knew. And when he had won, so turned he to\nwatch and join in the archery. And as he watched came there knaves to\nhim and mocked him.\n\n\"Faith though you wrestle well,\" one spoke, \"it doth not make you an\narcher. For here you find true archery than which none can do better.\"\n\n\"And I carry a club I would fain try on your thick skull,\" said\nanother who was even less gentle spoken.\n\n\"Of a good time, my friend, and you may,\" replied the lone knave.\n\n\"No such time befits the same as now,\" replied the first knave.\n\n\"If they will wait for my trial with bow and arrow I would be the last\nto keep you waiting.\" So spoke the stranger.\n\nSo then one of the knaves hurried away and received permission.\n\n\"Then furnish me a club,\" said the stranger.\n\n\"Here then is mine,\" offered the third knave.\n\nYet, forsooth, the club was but a sorry one and so the unknown would\nnot use it.\n\n\"Then show you a coward's heart,\" replied he who would strive with\nhim. And then the three rushed upon the stranger and would do him\nhurt.\n\nSo now came bearing down on the three none other than Allan who had\noverheard the parley.\n\n\"For shame, knaves. No true men would treat stranger so. He asks\nnothing more than is fair. Give him a club of his choosing.\"\n\n\"Of a faith, young master, this quarrel is none of yours, and warrants\nno interference. Leave this fellow to us, and we shall give him\nclubbing of his choosing.\" And the man who addressed the boy, though\nhe looked not straight at him, growled surlily.\n\n\"I shall give you a thrashing, fool, unless you do my bidding,\"\nreplied the boy, hotly.\n\nBut the three surly brutes moved uneasily. And then came Sir Percival\nforward.\n\n\"What have we here?\" he asked.\n\nSo Allan waited for the men to say. But they, now frightened, made no\nspoken word.\n\n\"These knaves would play foul tricks on this strange fellow. This one,\nwould strive with him and yet would not offer other club than this.\nAnd when the stranger asked to have one of his choice they called him\ncoward and would beat him.\"\n\n\"And I doubt not, fools, this club you offer will not stand one blow.\"\nSo Sir Percival brought it down on the first knave's head, and, lo,\nthough the blow was not a hard one, yet did the club break in two.\n\n\"So methought. Now go you Allan and get club that will do. And then\nwill you, stranger, give this villain a sound trouncing.\" And Sir\nPercival stayed so that the troublemakers did not depart.\n\nSo Allan brought a club which suited the stranger.\n\nNow did the two battle long and well. Both the stranger and he who\nfought with him were of great strength and each was exceeding quick.\n\nAs wood struck wood and each tried to get full blow upon the other, so\nturned all eyes upon the two. And except for glancing blows neither\ncould bring the other down. And though the sparks flew, yet each held\nhis club and was hardly hurt. So now they rested for a few moments.\n\nAnd while they waited, the stranger turned to Allan and spoke.\n\n\"I thank you for your brave upstanding of me, young master. And I hope\nsome day I may serve you equally well.\"\n\n\"You are a worthy man. Serve me now by trouncing the knave who battles\nwith you.\"\n\n\"I can but try, yet right skillful is the fellow.\"\n\nSo they turned to again. Yet this time the stranger fought the better.\nSoon the other was forced back, foot by foot. And even as the stranger\nseemed to have all the best of it, his foot seeming slipped, and he\nwent to his knees.\n\nFiercely the other came upon him. Yet as he came closer the stranger's\nclub moved swiftly. From out the seeming victor's hand flew his mighty\nclub and next second found him clubbed to the ground, senseless.\n\nNow the stranger sat himself down for he needed rest sorely. But only\nfor a little while and thereafter he turned to try his skill with bow\nand arrow. And though he had shown skill in all of the other feats he\nproved his mastery here. For he was wondrous expert in his archery.\n\n\"Here you, is fair target,\" he finally suggested after many trials.\nAnd went to distant tree and removed from bough upon it, all its\nleaves but one.\n\n\"Shoot you all at this. And if you bring it down I will call you\nskillful.\"\n\nBut only one would try for it. And he came close but missed.\n\nNow did the stranger raise his own bow. Nor did he seem to take aim\nbut let the arrow fly. And the arrow carried the twig and leaf with it\nto the ground.\n\n\"Of a truth,\" said King Arthur, \"a right worthy knave is that and I\nwould speak to him.\"\n\nSo they brought the stranger before the king.\n\n\"Thou hast done exceeding well, this day, fellow. Tell us then the\nbanner that you serve.\"\n\n\"That I cannot do. For, sire, such are my master's commands. Yet may\nI say no knight is more true and worthy.\"\n\n\"Then must we wait for your master's coming. Go thou hence and tell\nyour master he can be proud of thee. And take you this bag of gold\nbesides such other prizes as are yours.\" So as the knave stood there,\nthe King turned to Sir Dagonet, his jester, who was making himself\nheard.\n\n\"A fool speaks, sire. Yet claim I, like master like man. So then must\nthis fellow's master be right skillful to hold him. And since this\nmaster is not you, nor Sir Launcelot, then I pick him to be Sir\nTristram.\"\n\n\"Fool's reasoning, yet hath it much sense,\" said the King.\n\nNow the stranger left. But ere departing, he turned to Allan.\n\n\"I trust, young master, I shall see you again. As to who I am, know\nyou for your own keeping--fools ofttimes reason best of all.\"\n\nThe yeoman rode far into the forest. Then when he came to a lone\nhabitation he dismounted. A knight seated near the small window at the\nfurther wall greeted him as he entered.\n\n\"How did the day turn out? No doubt they trounced you well.\"\n\n\"No, master, no trouncing did I get. Instead, the good King spoke\npleasantly unto me, gave me this bag of gold, and commended me to my\nmaster. Furthermore, see you these prizes that are mine?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" the yeoman continued, not a bit grieved at the knight's banter,\n\"I even heard the King's fool remark that since the man was so good,\nthe master need must be. And then and there he hazarded a shrewd guess\nthat if this master were not the King, nor Sir Launcelot, then it must\nneed be you.\"\n\n\"Then truly am I in good company. Now then tell me what news is there\nof tomorrow?\"\n\n\"The King of Northgalis desires your aid. That I heard him say. Sir\nLauncelot is to joust for Cadoris as is Sir Palomides, and these two,\nof a truth, make it one-sided.\"\n\n\"Worthy Gouvernail, prove again my faith in you. Procure for me a\nshield, one that holds no insignia, so that I may enter the lists\nunbeknownst to any. I would not have them know I am Tristram, so that\nit may be my good fortune to joust with many knights who know me not.\"\n\n\"That, good master, is not hard. I know a place where I can obtain a\nblack shield, one that holds no other remembrance upon it. It should\nserve your purpose well.\"\n\n\"By my faith, did ever better knave serve master? Right proud of you\nam I, Gouvernail. And would that I too had bags of gold I could give\nyou for your loyal service.\"\n\n\"Nay, master, such service as I give I measure not by aught that you\ncan pay.\"\n\n\"That do I know full well, else had you left me long since, for little\nhave I paid,\" Sir Tristram answered, soft spoken and with great\naffection.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT\n\nSir Tristram's Prowess\n\n\nSo the next day Sir Tristram, carrying the black shield, went forth to\nenter the lists. And none knew him. The great conflict had already\nbegun when he arrived. He found himself a place among those knights\nwho jousted for Northgalis. And very soon all perceived that this\nknight with the black shield was skillful and strong. Well and lustily\ndid he battle and none could withstand him. Yet did he not meet with\nSir Launcelot nor with Sir Palomides, on this first day. Nor did any\nknow him, but all marveled at his worth and bravery.\n\nSo, as the day was done, this Unknown and his servant, Gouvernail,\nrode back into the forest. And none followed him for he was a brave\nknight and all respected him and his desire to stay unknown. Yet did\nthe judges declare the side of Northgalis victor and as for single\nknight, the most worthy was the Unknown. And he was called \"the Knight\nof the Black Shield.\"\n\nNow as the judges' duties were done, King Arthur showed how wroth he\nwas that strange knight had carried off such great honors.\n\n\"Yet do we hope tomorrow shall show other reckoning than this. For\ngood Launcelot shall be there and so shall we.\"\n\nOn the morn the heralds called forth the brave knights once again. And\nwith the call came the \"Knight of the Black Shield.\"\n\nSir Palomides was await for him, eager and alert, to be the first to\njoust. And so they, like great hounds, went at each other. And truly,\nSir Tristram found his foe a worthy one. Long did they joust without\neither besting the other until he of the black shield by great skill\nand fine force brought down a mighty blow and did smite Sir Palomides\nover his horse's croup. But now as the knight fell King Arthur was\nthere and he rode straight at the unknown knight shouting, \"Make thee\nready for me!\" Then the brave sovereign, with eager heart, rode\nstraight at him and as he came, his horse reared high. And such was\nthe King's strength he unhorsed Sir Tristram.\n\nNow, while the latter was on foot, rode full tilt upon him, Sir\nPalomides, and would have borne him down but that Sir Tristram was\naware of his coming, and so lightly stepping aside, he grasped the arm\nof the rider and pulled him from his horse. The two dashed against\neach other on foot and with their swords battled so well that kings\nand queens and knights and their ladies stood and beheld them. But\nfinally the Unknown smote his foe three mighty blows so that he fell\nupon the earth groveling. Then did they all truly wonder at his skill\nfor Sir Palomides was thought by many to be the most skillful knight\nin Britain.\n\nA knight now brought horse for Sir Tristram, for now, all knew that it\nmust be he. So too was horse brought for Sir Palomides. Great was the\nlatter's ire and he came at Sir Tristram again. Full force, he bore\nhis lance at the other. And so anew they fought. Yet Sir Tristram was\nthe better of the two and soon with great strength he got Sir\nPalomides by the neck with both hands and so pulled him clean out of\nhis saddle. Then in the presence of them all, and well they marveled\nat his deed, he rode ten paces carrying the other in this manner and\nlet him fall as he might.\n\nSir Tristram turned now again and saw King Arthur with naked sword\nready for him. The former halted not, but rode straight at the King\nwith his lance. But as he came, the King by wondrous blow sent his\nweapon flying and for a moment Sir Tristram was stunned. And as he sat\nthere upon his horse the King rained blows upon him and yet did the\nlatter draw forth his sword and assail the King so hard that he need\nmust give ground. Then were these two divided by the great throng. But\nSir Tristram, lion hearted, rode here and there and battled with all\nwho would. And of the knights who opposed him he was victor of eleven.\nAnd all present marveled at him, at his strength and at his great\ndeeds.\n\nYet had he not met Sir Launcelot, who elsewhere was meeting with all\nwho would strive with him. Not many, however, would joust with him for\nhe was known as the very bravest and most skillful. So as he sat there\nall at ease, there came the great acclaim for the Knight of the Black\nShield. Nor did Sir Launcelot know him to be Sir Tristram. But he got\nhis great lance and rushed toward the cry. When he saw this strange\nknight he called to him, \"Knight of the Black Shield, prepare for me.\"\n\nAnd then came such jousting as had never been seen. For each knight\nbowed low his head and came at the other like the wind. When they met\nit was very like thunder. Flashed lance on shields and armor so that\nsparks flew. And each would not give to the other one step but by\ngreat skill with shield did avoid the best of each other's blows.\n\nThen did Sir Tristram's lance break in two, and Sir Launcelot, through\nfurther ill fortune, wounded Sir Tristram in his left side. But\nnotwithstanding, the wounded knight brought forth his sword and rushed\ndaringly at the other with a force that Sir Launcelot could not\nwithstand, and gave him a fearful blow. Low in his saddle sagged Sir\nLauncelot, exceeding weak for many moments. Now Sir Tristram left him\nso and rode into the forest. And after him followed Gouvernail, his\nservant.\n\nSore wounded was Sir Tristram yet made he light of it. Sir Launcelot\non his part recovered soon and turned back to the tourney, and\nthereafter did wondrous deeds and stood off many knights, together and\nsingly.\n\nNow again was the day done and the tournament, too. And to Sir\nLauncelot was given full honor as victor of the field. But naught\nwould Sir Launcelot have of this. He rode forthwith to his King.\n\n\"Sire, it is not I but this knight with the Black Shield who has shown\nmost marvelous skill of all. And so I will not have these prizes for\nthey do not belong to me.\"\n\n\"Well spoken, Sir Launcelot and like thy true self,\" replied the King.\n\"So since this knight is gone, will you go forth with us within the\nfortnight in search for him. And unless we are in great error we shall\nfind this Knight of the Black Shield no more, no less, than Sir\nTristram.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINE\n\nThe Kitchen Boy\n\n\nAmong all those who came to the court of King Arthur at this Pentecost\nseeking hospitality, were two strangers in especial, who because of\nbeing meanly garbed and of a seeming awkwardness brought forth the\nmockery and jest of Sir Kay the Seneschal. Nor did Sir Kay mean harm\nthereby, for he was knight who held no villainy. Yet was his tongue\noverly sharp and too oft disposed to sting and mock.\n\nToo, the manner of their coming was strange. One was a youth of\nhandsome mien. Despite his ill garb, he seemed of right good worship.\nHim, our young page Allan found fallen in a swoon, very weak and near\nunto death, asprawl on the green about a mile from the castle.\nThinking that the man was but a villain, he would fain have called one\nof the men-at-arms to give him aid, but that something drew him to\ncloser view. And then the boy felt certain that this was no villain\nborn for his face bespoke gentle breeding. So he himself hastened for\nwater and by much use of it the man soon opened his eyes and found\nhimself. So he studied the lad as he helped him to greater ease but\neither through his great weakness or no desire he did not speak.\n\n\"Stranger,\" said Allan to the man, \"if there is aught that I can do\nfor you or if I can help you in any way I give you offer of service.\nMayhap of the many knights who are here, there is one whose aid you\nmay justly claim.\"\n\nThe stranger held answer for many moments, then he spoke.\n\n\"There are those here, lad, whose service I may well accept for they\nhold ties of blood to me. But I would not. Rather, if your patience\nwill bear with me, I would fain have your help so that I can appear in\nthe presence of the King this day. For so it is ordained and by\nappearing there I shall find some part of my row accomplished. On this\nholy day, I have boon to ask from your King.\"\n\n\"So shall I and right gladly lead you there. Good sir, my name is\nAllan. I am page to Sir Percival, and I would bespeak your name.\"\n\n\"I beg of thee, Allan, think not that I am churlish and yet must I\nwithhold my name. For it is part of the vow I have made. Nor,\nforsooth, am I therefore the less grateful.\"\n\n\"No offense take I, friend. So when you feel disposed I shall guide\nyour steps for audience with our good King.\"\n\nThe stranger, weak and spent, leaning mightily on his young friend\nmade his way to the great hall. And as we have recounted, though all\nwere struck by oddness and meanness of the stranger's clothes, yet\nonly Sir Kay made point to taunt him. Yet did he make no answer to\nthese taunts but waited with a great meekness for his turn before the\nKing. And that he should wait with such meekness was strange for he\nseemed to be a high born knight.\n\nThere were many who sought audience with the King and it was long\nbefore the stranger's turn came. Weak he still was, but he made no\ncomplaint, and when others would crowd before him so that they could\nspeak the sooner to King Arthur, he did not chide them but permitted\nit. At last Sir Launcelot came forward, for he had observed this and\nmade each of them find the place which was first theirs, so that the\nstranger's turn came as it should. Weak though he was he walked with a\ngreat firmness to the dais, and none there saw his poor clothes for\nthe fineness of him. The King turned to him and he nodded kindly.\n\n\"Speak, friend. In what way can we be of service to thee?\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said the stranger, \"I come to ask of thee three boons. One I\nask this day and on this day one year I shall come before you and\ncrave your favor for the other two.\"\n\n\"If the boon you ask, stranger, is aught we can grant, we shall do so\ncheerfully, for on this day we heed all prayers.\"\n\n\"I ask very little, sire. This and no more do I wish--that you give\nme food and drink for one year and that on this day a year hence I\nshall make my other two prayers.\"\n\n\"It is indeed little you ask. Food and drink we refuse none. It is\nhere. Yet while your petition might well beseem a knave, thou seemeth\nof right good worship, a likely youth, too, none fairer, and we would\nfain your prayer had been for horse and armor. Yet may you have your\nwish. Sir Kay,\" and the King turned to his Seneschal, \"see you to it\nthat this stranger finds his wish satisfied.\"\n\nSo the King turned to others present, for of those who sought audience\nthere were many. And so forgot all of the fair youth for many a day.\n\nSir Kay laughed mockingly at the unknown.\n\n\"Of a truth this is villain born. For only such would ask for food and\ndrink of the King. So therefore he shall find place in our kitchen. He\nshall help there, he shall have fat broth to satisfy himself and in a\nyear no hog shall be fatter. And we shall know him as the Kitchen\nBoy.\"\n\n\"Sir Kay,\" frowned Sir Launcelot, \"I pray you cease your mocking. It\nis not seemly. This stranger, whosoever he may be, has right to make\nwhatsoever request he wishes.\"\n\n\"Nay, Sir Launcelot, of a truth, as he is, so has he asked.\"\n\n\"Yet I like not your mocking,\" said Sir Launcelot as he looked\nfrowningly at Sir Kay, while next to him stood Sir Gawaine and Sir\nPercival, neither of whom could scarce contain himself.\n\n\"It is well, we know you, Sir Kay. Or, by our guardian saints we would\nmake you answer for your bitter tongue. But that we know it belies a\nheart of kindness we would long since have found quarrel with you.\" So\nspoke Sir Percival and Sir Gawaine nodded in assent.\n\n\"Stay not any quarrel for any seeming knowledge of me, kind friends,\"\nfrowned back Sir Kay.\n\nBut the two knights moved away. Sir Kay was of great shame. And so to\ncover it he turned to the stranger in great fury. \"Come then to your\nkennel, dog,\" he said.\n\nOut flashed the sword of Sir Gawaine. Yet did Sir Launcelot withhold\nhim.\n\n\"Sir, I beg you to do me honor of feasting with us this day?\"\n\n\"I thank you Sir Launcelot. Yet must I go with Sir Kay and do his\nbidding. There do be knights well worth their places at the Round\nTable. And I note right well that they set high example to those who\nare still but lads and who are to become knights in good time. So to\nyou all I give my thanks.\"\n\nThen followed the stranger after Sir Kay while the three knights and\nAllan watched him go and marveled at his meekness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TEN\n\nPentecost\n\n\nAnd so in turn came the second stranger before King Arthur. Poorly\nclothed, too, yet had his coat once been rich cloth of gold. Now it\nsat most crookedly upon him and was cut in many places so that it but\nbarely hung upon his shoulders.\n\n\"Sire,\" said the stranger, \"you are known everywhere as the noblest\nKing in the world. And for that reason I come to you to be made\nknight.\"\n\n\"Knights, good friend,\" replied the King, \"are not so easily made.\nSuch knights as we do appoint must first prove their worth. We know\nthee not, stranger, and know not the meaning of thy strange garb. For\ntruly, thou art a strange sight.\"\n\n\"I am Breunor le Noire and soon you will know that I am of good kin.\nThis coat I wear is token of vow made for vengeance. So, I found it on\nmy slain father and I seek his slayer. This day, oh King, I go forth\ncontent, if you make promise that should I perform knightly deed you\nwill dub me knight of yours.\"\n\n\"Go thou forth, then. We doubt not that thou wilt prove thy true valor\nand be worthy of knighthood. Yet proof must be there.\"\n\nOn this selfsame day, Breunor le Noire departed.\n\nNext morn, the King together with Sir Launcelot, Sir Percival, Sir\nGawaine, Sir Pellimore, Sir Gilbert, Sir Neil and Sir Dagonet, indeed\na right goodly party, prepared to depart. Nor did they purpose to\nreturn until they met with Sir Tristram, for King Arthur was of great\ndesire to have this good knight as one of the Round Table.\n\nNow as these, the flower of King Arthur's court, were waiting for Sir\nDagonet who was to be with them and who had delayed, Sir Launcelot saw\nAllan the boy watching them from the side. Saw too, the great wish in\nthe lad's eyes. Nor did Allan see himself observed for Sir Launcelot\nwas not then with the others.\n\nA thought came to this fine spirited knight and it brought great and\nsmiling good humor to his lips. He rode to Sir Percival's side and the\ntwo whispered for many moments. Then did the two speak to the King and\nhe laughed, but did not turn to gaze at the boy. Sir Gawaine now\njoined in the whispering. Then did all four laugh with great\nmerriment. So Sir Pellimore and the other knights inquired the cause\nfor the merriment and, being told, laughed too. Kindly was the\nlaughter, strong men these who could yet be gentle. Sir Launcelot now\nturned and rode hard at the boy.\n\n\"And wherefore, lad,\" and dark was his frown and greatly wroth he\nseemed, \"do you stand here watching? Rude staring yours and no fit\nhomage to pay your betters. Perchance, we may all be displeased, the\nKing, Sir Percival, and all of us.\"\n\nNow the lad's eyes clouded. To have displeased these knights, the\ngreatest men in all the world, for so he thought them. Then and there\nhe wished he could die. Woe had the knight's words brought to him.\n\n\"Indeed, and I meant no disrespect, Sir Launcelot. Indeed--\" and said\nno more for he knew he would weep if he spoke further. So he saw not\nthe dancing laughter in the knight's eye, nor the wide grins on the\nfaces of the others.\n\n\"Yet we must punish thee, lad. So then prepare you to accompany us.\nGet your horse at once. Nor will we listen to any prayer you may make\nfor not going because of your youth.\"\n\nAgape, Allan turned to look at him. For he knew he could not have\nheard aright. But now, as he looked, he saw that Sir Launcelot was\nlaughing and then as he turned wondering, he saw his own lord and the\nKing and the other knights watching him with great glee.\n\n\"You mean then, that I--I--may go with all of you!\"\n\nAnd then so that there would be no chance of its being otherwise, he\nrushed in mad haste to get his horse. Joy was the wings which made his\nfeet fly. He came back in quick time, a bit uncertain, riding forward\nslowly, diffidently, and stopped a little way from them, awaiting\nword. Then did Sir Launcelot ride to him and place kindly arm about\nthe youth and bring him among them all.\n\nNow Sir Dagonet was with them and they rode forth.\n\nWith the equipage came the hounds, for the first day of their journey\nwas to be given over to hunting. There came also the master of the\nhounds who was to return with them at the close of the hunt.\n\nNone other than the great Launcelot rode with Allan and none sat\nstraighter and more at ease in his saddle than the boy as they passed\nthe Queen, the Lady Olande, her two daughters and many other ladies of\nthe realm. Nor did the boy see any other than the minx Yosalinde. But\nshe--she did not seem to find him among the knights, yet he wondered\nhow she could help but see him. He would have liked to call to her,\n\"See, here am I among all these brave knights.\" Instead he rode past\nvery erect. If she would not see him, what matter, since, he was\nthere, one of the company.\n\nThen, of a sudden, she smiled straight at him. So that for him was the\nfull glory of the world. And we doubt not, for that smile he would\nhave fought the bravest knight in all the world and found man's\nstrength therein.\n\nNow the company found itself in the woods and many hours journey away.\nSo they rode hard for they liked not to tarry on the road.\n\nLong after midday, King Arthur and his men spread out for the hunt.\nThe forest in which they now found themselves held game and wild\nanimals in plenty. Soon thereafter did the hounds give tongue for they\nhad found the scent. No mean prey had they found though, for the\nquarry gave them a long race. Close behind the hounds came King Arthur\nand almost as close, Sir Percival and Sir Launcelot.\n\nNow, at last, the stag, a noble animal with wondrous horns, lithe body\nand beautifully shaped limbs was at bay. Straight and true, at its\nthroat, flew the leader of the pack, and sank its teeth deep into it,\nwhile above the King blew loud and long the death note of the chase.\nNo need for other hounds nor for weapons of the men.\n\nDark had stolen over the forest when the men with huge appetites came\nto sup. Juicy venison steak was there, so was the wild duck and the\npheasant in plenty. To the full they ate as did the few men at arms\nthat were with them.\n\nYet none stayed awake long thereafter. It had been an arduous day.\nAllan alone was wide-awake; his eyes would not close. And he knew of a\ncertainty that he was the most fortunate lad in all the world. When he\nshould become a man, he would be--well, he was not certain whether he\nwould be like unto the King, Sir Percival or Sir Launcelot. Yes, he\ndid know, he would be like them all. Now there came mixed thoughts of\na maid who waved her hand and smiled at him. And he felt of a\nprecious ring upon his finger.\n\nSo now his eyes closed; he found himself seeking the Holy Grail. And\nduring all of the night dreamed that he had found it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\n\nAllan Meets a Stranger\n\n\nThe noble cortege, after the first day's hunt, continued on its\njourney.\n\nIt had reached Leek, in Stafford on the morn of the fifth day ere word\ncame of Sir Tristram. Here, was heard from some, Sir Tristram was then\non way to Scotland, and from still others, that he was bound for\nKinkenadon in Wales.\n\n\"By my faith,\" spoke Sir Gawaine, \"there are none that are more ready\nto testify to Sir Tristram's greatness and ability, too. Yet still,\nhave I many doubts as to his being both on way to Scotland and to\nWales as well.\"\n\n\"If it were left to me,\" said Sir Dagonet, \"I would hie me to Ireland.\nA likely spot to find him, say I. For there are none who have said\nthat they know of the good knight's journey thitherward.\"\n\n\"We, for ourselves, think it best,\" the king interrupted, \"to tarry\nhere this day. Our comrade, Pellimore, expresses great desire to have\nus partake of his hospitality and we are fain, so to do. What say\nyou?\"\n\n\"It were wisdom to do so, methinks,\" agreed Sir Percival. \"Tomorrow\nwe may find here some further news of Sir Tristram's way.\"\n\n\"Aye, sir knights,\" added Sir Launcelot, \"for we need must know\nwhether we continue our travel north or west from this point.\"\n\nSo all of them were housed within the castle walls. And Sir Pellimore\nspread bounteous feast before his guests at midday for he held it high\nhonor to be host to such as these.\n\nNow, as the repast had been completed, Allan grew restless. He was of\na mind to ride forth and so craved permission from Sir Percival who\ngave ready consent.\n\nForth he went and rode for many an hour. And then, since the day had\ngreat heat, he found himself turn drowsy. Thereupon finding a\npleasant, shaded spot, he quickly made a couch of cedar boughs and\nsoon was fast asleep.\n\nIt seemed to the boy he had slept but few moments when his eyes opened\nwide with the certainty that other eyes were directed upon him. Nor\nwas this mere fancy nor dream. Near him sat a monk, and from under the\nblack hood the face that peered forth at him was gaunt, cadaverous,\nwith eyes that seemed to burn straight through the lad. But for the\neyes, this figure could well have been carven, so still and immovable\ndid it sit there and gaze at the youth. Nor did the monk speak far\nmany minutes even though he must have known that the boy was awake and\nwatching him.\n\nThe sun now hung low in the sky. Allan knew that he must have been\nasleep for at least two hours. He knew, too, that he should rise and\nreturn to the castle, since the hour was already late and his time\noverspent. Yet did the monk's eyes hold him to the spot. Nor was the\nthing that held him there fear; rather could it be described as the\nfeeling one has before a devout, sacred and holy presence. Despite the\nholy man's unworthy aspect he inspired no fear in the lad.\n\n\"Allan, boy,\" and the lad wondered that the monk knew him by name,\n\"two things I know have been chief in your thoughts these days.\" Kindly\nwas the monk's tone. \"What then are these two things?\"\n\nNo thought had the boy of the oddness of the monk's words, nor of his\nquestions. Nor of the fact that the monk seemed to be there present.\nSomehow, the whole of it took on some great purport. Allan stopped\nnot to wonder, which the two things the monk mentioned were uppermost\nin his mind but straightway made reply.\n\n\"Strange monk, I think and dream of the Holy Grail. And think too of\nYosalinde, sister to my Lord Percival. And of naught else so much. But\npray you, holy father, who are you?\n\n\"Truth, lad. As to who I am or as to where I come, know you this. I\ncome to you from that same place as do all dreams.\n\n\"Aye lad. Dreaming and fancying shall ever be yours. These son, shall\nbring you the visions of tomorrow and many another day.\n\n\"I have come to tell you this, lad. But two years or more and you\nshall start in earnest on your search for the Grail. And whether you\nfind the same, I shall not and cannot say, for the finding depends on\nyou. The way shall be hard, youth of many dreams, though you will have\nhelp and guidance, too. But the great inspiration for it all shall\ncome to you from the second of these, your two big thoughts.\n\n\"I sought you many a day, lad. Merlin has sounded the message for me\nto all the knights of Britain. Once before, years ago, I came to find\nthe likely seeker for the Grail and thought that I had found him. Yet\ndid the crucible's test find some alloy and so I had need to come\nagain.\n\n\"Then,\" said Allan but barely comprehending, \"you are none other than\nSir Joseph of Armathea.\"\n\n\"Lad, it matters not as to who and what I am. It is of you, we are now\nconcerned. Dear, dear, lad, they shall name you again and the name\nwhich shall be yours shall ever after be symbolic with the very best\nthat manhood holds.\"\n\n\"Go your way, now. For I must speak with many more this day ere I\nreturn. A knight comes but now, with whom I must hold counsel. And I\nwould fain speak to him, alone.\"\n\n\"True, father, I had best go. For Sir Percival will think me\nthoughtless, if not worse. As to what you have said, I can do but that\nbest which is in me and ever seek to make that best better. And so, I\nask your blessing.\"\n\nThe boy knelt. The monk, lean, black cowled, eyes glowing with a light\nthat held the supernatural, placed hand upon the boy's head and gave\nhim blessing. So then the boy mounted horse and was away.\n\nHe rode hard for he held great anxiety to return quickly. And all the\ntime he rode he thought of the things the strange monk had told him,\nSome of it, he did not altogether understand. That was because of his\nyouthfulness. It was to come back to him when many months had passed.\nThis however, he knew, he was destined to make search for the Holy\nGrail. For so, the holy man had ordained.\n\nSir Percival, a bit anxious, was waiting for the lad when he returned.\n\n\"I went far and then fell asleep,\" Allan explained. \"Nor did I awaken\nuntil the sun hung low.\" He did not speak of the meeting with the\nmonk.\n\n\"It is well you are back, lad. For I was fast growing worried over the\nlateness of your return. Turn in then. I wot not, but that food will\nbe found for you on which you can sup. Sir Launcelot went forth some\nhours ago. I fancy he went in search of you, though he would not admit\nthis to be the purpose of his departure.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWELVE\n\nThe Stranger and Sir Launcelot\n\n\nLet us then turn to Sir Launcelot now making his way along the road\nover which Allan had been seen to depart. Though the knight had\ndenied that he purposed to seek the lad, yet had his horse taken that\nway. A growing fondness for the boy which he had not made too obvious,\nfor it was not his wont to show too easily his feelings. Display or\nshow of emotion ever embarrassed him. He had noted the long absence of\nAllan and so had mounted his horse intent to all appearance on a short\ncanter.\n\nHalf way to where Allan had made his couch, the road over which he had\nridden branched right and left and some miles down came together\nagain. Now when Allan returned he took the road to his right having\nridden the other way earlier in the day. Sir Launcelot made for the\nroad to the right of him and so missed the boy returning.\n\nHe found himself at the place at which the boy had slept. He\ndismounted to observe more closely. Then he beheld the holy man as he\nstepped from the shadows.\n\n\"Good day to you, holy father,\" the knight greeted him.\n\n\"God's blessing stay with thee, son. I have been expecting thee.\"\n\n\"Nay, father, not me. Other knight, mayhap. For I knew not myself I\nwould be here.\"\n\n\"Yet did I know, Sir Launcelot. You came here to seek the youth Allan\nand knew not that you came in obedience to greater will than your own.\nAnd having come, you must, prithee, listen to the things that must be\ntold you.\"\n\n\"Launcelot,\" and the monk spoke sternly and yet with great sadness,\n\"as measured by men thou art the bravest knight in Christendom.\nChivalrous, strong, yet gentle and ever ready to succor the weak and\ndistressed. Your name shall be emblazoned as symbolic of chivalry.\"\nThe strange man paused for a time.\n\n\"I speak now of the Holy Grail,\" he resumed. \"Who would be better\nfitted to seek and find the Holy Grail? Are there any who hold greater\ndesire to find the same? And who seeks to make himself more worthy?\"\n\n\"And yet, though you seek until Judgment Day you will never find it.\nIn the innermost soul of you, you know it to be so. The pity of it.\"\n\n\"Strange monk,\" and a dull red mantled the knight's cheeks, \"those are\nbold words you speak. None but Launcelot himself can tell the things\nhe may or may not do. And since I am not in search of father\nconfessor, nor since I sought not this meeting, I pray thee offer not\nyour counsel nor advice.\"\n\n\"The truth, then, sears, sir knight!\" Now the monk's eyes flashed.\nStraight and tall he stood and his lean figure held so much of that\nwhich was not earthly, that even the mighty Launcelot was daunted.\n\n\"Who then has more right or reason to tell you of these things. It is\nI who first picked you, long since, as likely finder of the Holy\nGrail. And when I found you slipping ever so little, and well you know\nwherein you have failed me, I sent Merlin to all of you. For since he\non whom I had built my faith could not measure to the test I had\nstrong need to find someone else.\n\n\"For Britain must hold the Grail. Somewhere in it, there must be the\nman who measures up to the test, high though it be.\"\n\n\"Son, son, the things you could have done. The fineness of you,\ncoarsened by the temptations you have met and not overcome. The joy\nyou have found in things that are sordid and count for so little.\"\n\nLow hung the knight's head, His anger had left him now. In its stead\nwas a deep humility.\n\n\"Father, you bare my soul. And yet have I striven. High did I hold\nthe ideals which first inspired me, I have overcome much, have tried\nto keep to the high set purpose. Yet I am but common clay, after all.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay son. I would all men held half thy nobility. Only,\" and now\nthe monk's tone was again kindly, \"there are some we weigh on much\nfiner scales than others. We ask more of them, seek more from them.\nForgive less, too. Perhaps we are wrong to desire so much from any\nmortal soul. Yet have we faith,--we believe.\"\n\n\"I find no complaint, holy father, in the measure you have set for me.\nFor I saw the things, I had the vision to see them. Saw too, the\nthings that were wrong even as I did these things.\"\n\n\"Yet, my son, a great task shall be yours. Now of the boy Allan.\" The\nmonk paused.\n\n\"What of him, father? A fine lad is he. So young, yet is he too, to be\nburdened with great responsibilities? I pray thee, let him keep his\nyouth.\"\n\n\"Launcelot, my son, when will you grow to thy true self? For there\nlies your failure. You who took your responsibilities as burdens, when\nyou should have found great joy in that they were yours. Yet, now\nlisten to me as to this boy Allan. I have seen him this day, have\nspoken to him of the Holy Grail. A dreaming youth, yet is he fired by\nfine inspiration and great ideals. He is ordained to seek it. That\nholds no strangeness for there are many such. As to whether he finds\nit or not is dependent upon him, as it was once upon yourself. And\nsince you cannot find it, seek it as you will, I charge you with\nhelping him keep clean souled. Should he do so, ere many years will\npass, he may find it. For you, there will be the joy, the glory of\nservice, of having helped. Without your help, success for him will be\nso much less likely. Will you help him Launcelot? Think well before\nyou make reply.\"\n\nNot at once did Sir Launcelot answer. Yet it was the best within him\nthat did give final utterance.\n\n\"I promise you father, that such help as I can give the lad I shall.\nMuch have I learned. And with these things that I have learned he\nshall be guided. No bitterness mine. Since I am not to be the finder\nof the Holy Grail, I pledge you now my aid to Allan.\"\n\n\"Launcelot, so little fails you for that needed greatness. None have\nI loved so much. If you have sinned you have been great and glorious\neven in the sinning.\n\n\"Never have you been finer than now. Allan will need your help, your\nstrength. There shall be a maid too, to help him. The threads have\nalso been woven for that now. When the time shall come, you will call\nthis lad Galahad, the Chaste. Treat him ever as your son, Launcelot.\"\n\n\"Son and comrade, too, he shall be for me. Father, I thank you.\"\n\n\"So then I go, son. I could not love you more were you less a mortal\nsinner.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\n\nThe Party Divides\n\n\nWhen the morning came there was great indecision as to the further\nway, for no new information had come of Sir Tristram. Sir Gawaine now\nspoke for going north to Scotland. So too, was Sir Pellimore minded\nand Sir Gilbert as well. But Sir Percival spoke for Wales and so did\nSir Neil.\n\n\"As for me,\" said Sir Dagonet, \"I pick Wales, since Kinkenadon is the\nnearer to Ireland. My fool's head still fancies that we shall have\nneed to turn there ere we shall find this errant knight.\"\n\nNeither the King nor Sir Launcelot up to this time had expressed a\nchoice. But now the King vouchsafed a plan.\n\n\"It seems to us good plan for our party to divide. Some of us to go\nnorth, some west. You Launcelot could well go with one party and we\nwith the other. What say you friends?\"\n\nThat plan suited them all. So then the King went with Sir Gawaine, Sir\nPellimore, and Sir Gilbert, while Sir Launcelot accompanied Sir\nPercival, Sir Neil, Sir Dagonet and Allan. With each party, too, went\nthree men-at-arms.\n\nOur way shall be with Sir Percival.\n\nAt the end of the first half day they found themselves near the\ncrossroads of Nantwich.\n\n\"We must soon find place for food,\" remarked Sir Percival and lustily\nthey all agreed.\n\n\"See you castle beyond yonder crossroads?\" questioned Sir Neil, \"Sir\nManstor lives there with his three brothers. Right skillful knights\nare these but woe the lone stranger who passes by. For these are\nvillainous four.\"\n\n\"Right bitterly do you speak of them, Neil,\" remarked Sir Launcelot.\n\"And why?\"\n\n\"I pray fortune to permit me to meet with this Manstor. I stopped\nthere for food one day. Then did this knight, his brothers by his\nside, demand the bag of gold I carried with me. Nor would single one\namong them battle with me. It would have fared ill with me but for two\nknights who passing by, came to my aid.\"\n\n\"Our vow,\" said Sir Launcelot thoughtfully, \"is to find Sir Tristram.\nYet can I see no harm in straying from our way an hour or two, can\nyou, Percival?\"\n\n\"Not if there is promise of such entertainment as this,\" was the\nreply.\n\n\"These knights,\" interrupted Sir Neil, \"have stomach for neither joust\nnor other encounter when the odds are not with them. Nor will they\nventure to impede our way unless we number less than they.\"\n\n\"If greater or equal number withholds them,\" said Sir Dagonet. \"I\nwould favor them and withdraw. Then would there be one less doughty\nsword.\"\n\n\"Aye, Dagonet, we know your unselfish spirit,\" said Sir Neil and\nlaughed.\n\n\"The knight does not live who has bested me, nevertheless,\" replied\nthe jester, with pretended heat.\n\n\"The knight does not live who has had the chance,\" said Sir Percival.\n\"Yet we love you none the less, brother.\"\n\nSaid now Sir Launcelot: \"One of us could ride ahead. And, perchance,\nthese scheming knights will think that easy prey comes and so strive\nto impede the way. Then when they bear down upon him we can appear and\ngive them such entertainment as they have not had in many a day.\"\n\nNow one of the men-at-arms came forward.\n\n\"And if you will, masters, yonder cruel knight is cruel master as\nwell. And he holds my own brother within his prison walls for small\ncause. So I pray you, masters, succor him.\"\n\n\"Of a surety, Wonkin,\" said Sir Percival, \"we shall make every effort\nto set your brother free. Neil and I shall go forward and so find\nourselves seemingly enmeshed by them. Then will you, at proper time,\nLauncelot, come forward. And if Dagonet so wishes, he can protect our\nrear.\"\n\nThe two knights then hurried on. They had not far to go to the turn of\nthe road and there the four knights within the castle grounds, seeing\nthem, stood watching for a moment or so. Then each mounted his horse\nand in armor, rode forth from within the walls.\n\n\"We are knights on way to Wales,\" said Sir Percival in mild tone. \"We\nseek food for our midday meal.\"\n\n\"Food we will give you right gladly,\" replied the oldest of the four.\n\"But ask in payment such gold as you may have.\"\n\n\"That would be poor bargain,\" replied Sir Percival, still mild spoken.\n\"We had liefer go our way to place which seeks not such high pay.\"\n\n\"That may you well do, strangers, yet must you still leave your gold\nbehind. For we have great need of it.\"\n\n\"Yet no greater need for it than have we. Come, comrade, we must be on\nour way.\" So spoke Sir Percival to Sir Neil. And now the robber\nknights were certain that these were but timid men. So out came their\nswords as they rode at the two. But they found them ready and\nwatchful. And though the odds were two to one, it was not hard matter\nto hold the robbers off until Sir Launcelot came charging into the\nmelee.\n\nAs the four robbers turned to the newcomer and beheld his shield and\narmor, they knew that it was Launcelot. And knew too that this was\ntrap set for them. Thereupon did Sir Manstor withdraw for the moment\nfrom the struggle and blow horn he carried--two long and one short\nnote.\n\nOne of the brothers had already been unhorsed and most grievously\nwounded. Sir Manstor now came back to the aid of his brothers and of\nthem all he was most skillful. So Sir Launcelot turned to him and him,\nthe robber knight found more than a match.\n\nBut from within the walls came forty and more men at arms, some with\nbow and arrow and others with club and mace. And with them, two other\nknights.\n\nWhen Sir Launcelot saw these, he called to his comrades. \"Hard at\nthem, hard.\"\n\nFor he had in mind to down these three before the others came.\n\nThen did the three, that is, Launcelot, Percival and Neil with\nwondrous strength of arm, each by mighty blow, bring rider to the\nground. And Sir Manstor was dead because of the fearful blow of Sir\nLauncelot. The other two were asprawl on the ground and but barely\nmoving.\n\n\"I call this right skillfully done,\" said Sir Dagonet who now came\ntoward them. He had watched but had not joined in the struggle.\n\nNow, Wonkin and the two men at arms were there and so was Allan.\n\n\"Will you, good men, try out your bows on these hinds who are coming\nthitherward?\" said Sir Percival.\n\nStraightway then there flew three well aimed arrows. Then others flew\nand now answering arrows from the oncomers. But these did not harm\nfor Wonkin and the other two stood under cover of trees and so were\nnot easy targets.\n\nTwice more they let their arrows fly and five men of the forty had\nbeen stopped.\n\nNow as the others came at them with clubs and mace, Sir Launcelot\ncommanded Wonkin and the other two to withdraw a hundred pace and from\nthere continue to let their arrows fly. And this was great wisdom for\nelse the three could not have long withstood the large number.\n\nSo now the knights with their great lances fought off the villains and\nthe two knights who were with them. Very few who came within the reach\nof the long weapons escaped. And from their place the three men at\narms shot arrow after arrow into the attackers.\n\nThree of the knaves had hold of Sir Percival's horse and thereupon\nothers swarmed upon him and what with the blows of their maces and\nclubs, he was in sorry plight. Nor could Sir Launcelot turn to help\nhim for he was in great conflict with the two knights and a large\nnumber of them on foot and Sir Neil equally so. As for Allan he had\nalready ridden down two of the attackers and had brought his weapon\nwhich was cross between sword and dagger down upon their skulls. Now\nas he turned he saw the plight of his lord. So did Sir Dagonet, who\nthough timid had up to then made some ado to help. Whereupon both sped\nhard to Sir Percival's aid. And so skillful was the boy that he hewed\ndown several of the knaves and Sir Dagonet too, soon found that others\nof Sir Percival's attackers were turning their attention to him. All\nof which gave needed time for Sir Percival to escape from his\ndifficulty, draw sword and begin anew.\n\nNow Sir Launcelot brought down the two knights and the others like\nwolves stood off snarling at him, yet out of reach. Sir Neil too was\nfreer.\n\nThere were but ten of the attackers now. The others were either strewn\nabout the ground or were making their escape. And of these ten, two\neven then were brought down by the arrows of Wonkin and his two\ncomrades.\n\nWhereupon the last of the attackers turned and made haste to fly, the\nthree archers in close pursuit.\n\n\"These hinds would fair have overswarmed me had not the boy and\nDagonet come to my aid,\" remarked Sir Percival as he lifted his helmet\nfrom his head.\n\n\"How then, Allan, did you like the affray?\" inquired Sir Launcelot.\n\n\"Greatly,\" replied the lad. \"But I had wish I carried a lance instead\nof this, which is neither dagger nor sword.\"\n\n\"Right soon, shall these be yours as well, lad. Yet now we have earned\nsuch food as we may find within the castle. And I wot not,\" added Sir\nPercival, \"many prisoners, too, who will be glad of freedom.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\n\nKing Mark's Foul Plan\n\n\nSir Neil and Sir Dagonet now loudly summoned the castle servants\nbefore them but there were none to answer. So they prepared\nkitchenward where they found the wretches in great affright not\nknowing what dire fate was to befall them. Yet they, when assured that\nnaught was intended against them, eagerly hastened to obey the\ncommands of the good knights to prepare a sumptuous meal.\n\nSir Launcelot, Sir Percival and the other knights made, their way to\nthe dungeon. And truly they found a sad sight there. Though a large\nplace, yet was it overly crowded. In one place they found six knights,\nan unhappy six, three of whom had been imprisoned for many months, two\nhad been made captives within the fortnight and one had joined this\njoyless group but two days before.\n\n\"Aye,\" one of the first three explained to them, \"it is through God's\nmercy that we still live. There were three others with us, two of whom\nwere already here when this dire misfortune befell us and one who came\nsome weeks later. These three could not survive the foulness of this\nhole.\"\n\nBut now Sir Percival was seen to speak to the lone knight, the one who\nhad been made prisoner last of all. A melancholy figure, he did not\nseem to realize that release had come with the advent of these\nknights. In fact, through all the hubbub he seemed to have been lost\nwithin himself. No doubt, they were bitter thoughts that possessed him\nand at such times one is verily unmindful of things about him. Nor did\nthis knight seem mindful of the words spoken by Sir Percival for he\nmade no answer and lost none of his brooding air.\n\nYet, of a sudden, he seemed to awaken. For Sir Percival who had not\nbeen able to place him at first, had at last realized who the stranger\nwas.\n\n\"Who are you?\" the other questioned in turn rubbing his eyes. \"And\nthese other knights? But then, I know you all. How came you here, Sir\nPercival?\"\n\nWhen he was told, some of his dejection left him.\n\n\"Mine was truly a great unhappiness. These four robber knights did\nbeset me. And when I was overcome they demanded great ransom which I\nhad no means wherewith to satisfy. Then, when I heard the tale of how\nlong these fellow prisoners had been here I was greatly discouraged as\nto carrying out my intent to prove to King Arthur my worthiness for\nknighthood.\"\n\nIn the meanwhile, Sir Launcelot and Allan had made their way to where\nthe imprisoned yeomen and hinds had been kept. Here there were more\nthan fifty and a sad sight they were. It brought a great gulp of pity\ninto Allan's throat and unbidden tears came to his eyes. Sir Launcelot\ntoo was moved. Some of the prisoners were so weak they could hardly\nmove. Wonkin had found his brother almost at once and theirs was a\nhappy meeting.\n\n\"Go you up, good Allan, and order that food be brought for these\nwretches. And see to it that there is plenty of it.\"\n\nAllan gladly went and repeated Sir Launcelot's orders which the\nservants made great haste to obey.\n\nSo that all within the castle, fared well that day. And when Sir\nLauncelot and his party were ready to continue their journey the next\nmorning, there was with them Breunor le Noire and an added number of\nyeomen picked from the men who had been prisoners.\n\nJust before departure, Sir Percival went to the two brothers of Sir\nManstor who still were living, the other had not lived an hour.\n\n\"Sir Knights, we leave you now. Take you heed from this day's\nhappenings that such outlawry as yours brings just punishment.\nRemember, too, that King Arthur and all his knights will be ever\nwatchful that you conduct yourself in knightly ways. Woe betide you,\nif you do not.\"\n\nThe knights made no reply. Grievously wounded, with their brothers\ndead, they were in no mood for words. Yet must the truth of Sir\nPercival's words have been in their minds.\n\nOnward now went Sir Launcelot's party. Through that and the next day\nthey made their way and were well in Cornwall without further untoward\nhappening. Everywhere, the party made inquiries as to the whereabouts\nof Sir Tristram and from such news as they were able to gather they\nfelt assured that they had taken the right way and that King Arthur\nand the men with him were on a false trail.\n\nIt was on this day that they met with two knights who made them\nfriendly greetings and finding out the purpose of their journey\npretended not to know the whereabouts of Sir Tristram. Nor would they\nstay for any length of time giving as reason therefore great need of\nurgency on their part. Yet when these two knights had but gone a\nlittle way they turned, in great haste along another road. The end of\nthe day found them in the presence of King Mark of Cornwall who had no\ngreat love for King Arthur nor for any of his knights and who would do\nany or all of them great harm could he do so without discovery.\n\n\"Who then is this party?\" inquired the King after listening.\n\n\"They number but few,\" replied one of the knights. \"Sir Launcelot, Sir\nPercival, Sir Neil, and one other, and that fool who is jester to\nArthur. A boy is there too and fifteen men-at-arms.\"\n\n\"You speak truly,\" replied the king, \"as to their being few in number\nbut I would that two of these few, were not Launcelot and Percival.\nYet even with these two we should be able to overcome them. And in\nthat way I shall find some recompense for the many slights and haughty\noverbearingness of Arthur and his men.\" As he so spoke, King Mark's\nface plainly showed its cruelty and craft.\n\n\"Will you, good Bruyan, call Sir Bertram and Sir Pendore to me? And be\nsure to return for we must be speedy should we decide that it is wise\nfor us to take any step for their discomforture.\"\n\nNow as Bruyan returned with the two aforementioned, there also came\ninto the room a yeoman who served Sir Pendore. But of him neither the\nking nor any of the knights took notice but instead immediately began\ndiscussion as to the wisdom of waylaying these knights of King Arthur\nwho were now in Cornwall.\n\nWhether King Mark knew this to be so or not, yet of all his court,\nthere were no two who had more reason to hate Sir Launcelot than Sir\nBertram and Sir Pendore. For Sir Launcelot had come upon them once\nwhen they were in the midst of tormenting two holy men having first\ntaken from them a paltry purse which these two monks were carrying for\nworthy purpose. Then when Sir Launcelot had asked that they desist and\nreturn the holy men's purse they had replied with foul tongue and had\nmade for him. Soon, however, they found that this single knight was\nmaster of them both and would they then have complied with his\nrequests. However, Sir Launcelot who was ever slow to anger was now in\ngreat rage and he had taken them to the castle grounds of Sir Gawaine\nand there, before a large number he told of what had happened. And\nwhile fair ladies laughed at them and while men looked at them as they\nwould at hinds, Sir Launcelot had taken the flat of his sword and had\nbrought it down on both. Then he had asked two yeomen to club them\nfrom the castle grounds since they were unfit to be in the company of\nknights. This the yeomen had done right lustily.\n\nNeither Sir Pendore nor Sir Bertram had ever made mention of this\nevent. But there was no one in all of Britain whom they so fully hated\nas Sir Launcelot. Now, there seemed likely chance for revenge.\n\n\"How many men can you muster?\" asked Sir Bertram, speaking not over\nanxiously yet with meaning looked at Sir Pendore.\n\n\"Seven score or more\" replied the king of Cornwall.\n\n\"I would have more,\" replied Sir Pendore. \"What with Percival and\nLauncelot and this Neil whom I know not, one must make it more than\ncertain.\"\n\nIt was at this point that the yeoman who was busily at work over the\nweapons, cleaning them and putting them into perfect condition, as\nnone other in Cornwall could do, had become interested. Sir Percival?\n\nIt was this Sir Percival, knight of the Round Table, who had saved the\nfather of this yeoman from the deadly mace of one of his men in one of\nmany melees. It was but a small thing to the knight, long forgotten no\ndoubt, but to Walker, the son of the man who was saved, it meant that\nhe was in debt to this knight. So now he listened, interested. Then\ntoo, he had no great love for his master who was never kindly and he\nhad decided long ago that he would find a new master when the\nopportunity offered.\n\n\"I shall find more men, if I can,\" Mark offered in reply to Sir\nPendore's suggestion. Nor did it seem strange to him that the knight\nshould think that odds of seven to one were not enough.\n\n\"Where are these knights?\" asked Sir Bertram.\n\nSir Bruyan told him, the yeoman listening all the while.\n\n\"Let us then be off within thrice this hour,\" Mark concluded. \"Get\nyou as many men ready as you can,\" he said to Sir Bertram and to Sir\nPendore who were his chiefs.\n\nWalker, the yeoman, soon had completed his work. Thereupon he made his\nway into the forest to find him, who was best friend of his, to get\nadvice as to what to do.\n\nHe, whom he sought, was none other than our old friend Gouvernail,\nwho, of course, was not far from Sir Tristram, his master.\n\nThough he had long since severed fealty to King Mark, Sir Tristram had\nreturned near unto the court because of the love he bore one of the\ndamsels who was in it. It was Walker who had carried the messages\nGouvernail had brought from his master to this same lady.\n\nWalker soon came to the hiding place of his friend.\n\n\"What ho?\" asked Gouvernail. \"What brings you here at this unseemly\nhour?\"\n\n\"I need your advice,\" replied Walker. \"My poor head carries too great\na muddle.\"\n\n\"You come to one who can offer but poor solace there,\" replied\nGouvernail. \"If it were trusty arm, good club or something belike, you\ncould well come to me. But speak, what troubles you?\"\n\nSo Walker told him. Except that at first he made no mention of names.\n\n\"Keep you from it,\" advised Gouvernail. \"It is the business of your\nbetters and not of your meddling.\"\n\n\"Yet had Sir Percival done this thing for my father, and if he would,\nhe could have thought the same,--that it was not his affair but an\naffair of hind or yeoman.\"\n\n\"Is this Percival, he who is of King Arthur's court?\" asked\nGouvernail.\n\n\"Aye,\" replied Walker, nodding his head. \"Do you know him?\"\n\n\"Somewhat. Who else is there?\" he further questioned, now interested.\n\n\"Sir Launcelot, Sir Neil and some others.\"\n\n\"Did they speak of a boy being there?\"\n\n\"I do not remember. Yet I seem to recall that they did,\" replied\nWalker.\n\n\"I will help you. Come,\" and Gouvernail took his friend but a little\nway to where Sir Tristram was lodging.\n\nSir Tristram seated himself and listened to the two. He understood at\nonce.\n\n\"When did King Mark say that he would start with his men?\" he asked\nWalker.\n\n\"In three hours, Sir Knight,\" the man answered.\n\n\"Good. Let us be off. Good Gouvernail, get you my mail ready for I\nwould don it.\"\n\nWithin the half hour Sir Tristram with the two yeomen were on their\nway to meet Sir Percival and Sir Launcelot. So, strangely, they who\nsought him, were to find him come among them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\n\nThe Weasel's Nest\n\n\n\"Greeting, good knights,\" he announced. \"I am Sir Tristram.\"\n\nNothing could have thrown Sir Launcelot's party into greater\nastonishment. And yet no news could have been pleasanter.\n\n\"Right glad are we to see you, Sir Tristram, since we have sought you\nfor a great number of days. I am Sir Launcelot. Here is Sir\nPercival.\" And so this knight announced them all.\n\nThe two knights, Sir Tristram on the one hand, Sir Launcelot, on the\nother, observed each other. Each of them found much to like in the\nother. Then and there was the beginning of a friendship that was to\nlast until the day of Sir Tristram's death.\n\nAfter the first few moments, had passed, Sir Tristram came to the\nreason for his coming among them.\n\nThat the danger was grave, they knew at once. King Mark was cruel and\ncrafty. He would not venture this attempt unless he were certain that\nhe had great numbers behind him.\n\n\"My thought seems to be to retire to the nearest castle and there\ndefend ourselves as best we can,\" said Sir Percival.\n\n\"A right kindly thing, this of yours, Sir Tristram, to bring us this\nnews. And if we come out of this, I hope that I shall be able to find\nyou at any place you bespeak,\" Sir Launcelot remarked.\n\n\"The kindness is on the part of this man here.\" And Sir Tristram told\nthem of Walker. \"Need I say that I stay with you and share in your\nfortune such as it is. It should offer great sport and I would not\nmiss it, if I could.\"\n\nSir Launcelot nodded his head nor did he make any further demur.\n\n\"And you two?\" he now asked of Gouvernail and Walker.\n\n\"Oh, I,\" replied Sir Gouvernail, \"I find my place where my master is.\"\n\n\"And I?\" added Walker. \"I owe something to Sir Percival and so I too\nwill stay.\"\n\n\"Well then, perhaps we may keep them off, though not so easily,\" said\nSir Neil.\n\n\"We can but try,\" added Sir Launcelot.\n\nBut now Sir Dagonet, jester and fool, made his way forward.\n\n\"Spoke you of finding castle?\" he asked of Sir Percival.\n\nSir Percival nodded his head.\n\n\"Good man,\" Sir Dagonet spoke now to Walker. \"Did this weasel king say\naught as to the number of men he would send against us?\"\n\n\"Only, master, that when he mentioned that he would send one hundred\nor more and with them twenty knights, one there, thought that number\nnot enough and advised that the king add to it. Which the king said he\nwould do.\"\n\n\"The more the better,\" said Sir Dagonet.\n\n\"A strange wish,\" said Sir Neil. \"But then you are fool and that wish\nbelongs to a fool.\"\n\n\"Yet not such a great fool after all,\" spoke up Sir Launcelot. \"Truly\nDagonet, I often wonder at you. For here is what is in Dagonet's mind.\nSince the weasel comes after us and leaves his home empty, why not go\nto the home of the weasel?\"\n\nSuch a laugh now went up. For all of these knights saw that this would\nbe a deed that would ring throughout Britain and if successful, make\nMark the laughing stock of the land.\n\nBut after the laughter, Sir Tristram spoke, \"I ask a strange thing,\ngood knights, and hope it will receive favor in your eyes. King Mark\nhas been a strange uncle to me. He has treated me scurvily oft enough.\nYet when, if we come through this event as we hope, I would that you\nhold no further ill will against him. Understand me well. I ask for\nnaught, if any among us are hurt at his hand, for then he deserves all\nthat comes to him. But if we come through so that all can laugh at\nhim, then I ask you to forget the ill will for which he gives you such\ngood cause. For after all, he is blood kin of mine, a sorry thing, yet\nwhich I cannot forget.\" And now the knight waited answer.\n\nNow all the knights turned to Sir Tristram and there was something\nabout him that made them nod their heads in assent.\n\n\"Then do we promise this thing, you ask,\" said Percival. \"So now let\nus go to the weasel's nest.\"\n\nIn great humor and with many jests the men made their way to the road\nupon which the two knights of King Mark had made their return. And so\nwe find that as the crafty king was making his way forward to the\nattack, believing that it would be an overpowering surprise, and\nalready counting the fruits of victory, his intended victims were\nslipping through his clutches and making their way into the last of\nall places he could imagine.\n\nNow on their way, Sir Percival called the two yeomen, Gouvernail and\nWalker to him. And though he did not remember the event that Walker\nnarrated yet was he glad he had followed a kindly thought. And Allan\ntoo, realized that bread cast upon the water often returns.\n\n\"Need you a good yeoman?\" ventured Walker hopefully.\n\n\"If you are half as good as your friend here, then indeed have I need\nfor you,\" was Sir Percival's reply.\n\n\"I count him my better, Sir Knight,\" replied Gouvernail.\n\n\"This fool would overpraise me and lead you to expect overmuch,\" said\nWalker. \"I will do my best if you will but try me.\"\n\n\"That I shall,\" replied the knight. And thereupon the two, Gouvernail\nand Walker, fell back a little way and came to Allan who was glad of a\nchance to talk to Gouvernail. And as they rode forward the boy\nlistened to some of the tales and some of the doings of Sir Tristram.\n\nNow in the front there rode, the two, Sir Tristram and Sir Launcelot\nand with them Sir Dagonet.\n\n\"Truly, I often wonder, good Dagonet, wherefore they call you a fool,\"\nspoke Sir Launcelot. \"Here comes this thought of yours that could come\nonly from the wisest man or the greatest fool. Often, I wonder which\nyou are.\"\n\n\"Yet good Launcelot, since I am I, I know which of these I am. What\nsooth, what matters it, which you and all of these,\" and Sir Dagonet\npointed to the others with them, \"which you think me? If it pleases\nall of you, it pleases me to be a fool. Howsoever, it is ill wind\nthat does not blow some good and here we have Sir Tristram who is not\nin Ireland though I had reason for believing him there.\"\n\n\"Faith, friend, and I had but decided that I would journey henceward\nwithin two days,\" replied Sir Tristram wonderingly.\n\n\"See you then, Launcelot. I made but a fool's guess. Had I been a\nwise man I would not have been two days ahead of Sir Tristram.\"\n\nNow Sir Tristram who knew the way advised silence. For they were\nnearing the great castle walls. When they came thereto they found the\ngates closed and the drawbridge up.\n\nThen did Sir Tristram make call to those within. And these mistaking\nthis for the party that had gone therefrom hastened to obey and\nlowered the drawbridge and unlocked the gates. And then found\nthemselves facing strange knights, a strange party. And of all of them\nthey only recognized Sir Tristram.\n\nThen would they have made great ado to close the gates but it was too\nlate.\n\n\"Tell you all within these gates, that we shall treat none harshly\nexcept those who would make trouble.\"\n\nSo when Sir Percival's party was safely esconced, Sir Tristram left\nthem for a few moments. A few moments that lasted into the half hour.\nFor he went to see his lady love who was even then with the queen.\n\nNor did the queen treat him as harshly as she might have. Perhaps\nthis was because she felt that they were safe as long as this nephew\nwas with these intruders. Or perhaps she had not favored the ill\ntreatment by her royal spouse of so brave a knight.\n\nAnd if King Mark and his men had been surprised to find the bird\nflown, imagine then what must have been their thoughts when they\nreturned and found that they could not enter their own gates. That the\nbird was there and was shouting defiance at them. And worse yet, that\nin these shouts of defiance there was laughter and taunt and jest at\ntheir expense.\n\n\"What now?\" asked the cruel and crafty king.\n\nNor could one of his men tell him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\n\nTo The Rescue\n\n\n\"Methinks,\" said King Arthur on the fourth day of their journey into\nScotland \"that we will not find this Sir Tristram. What say you\nGawaine?\"\n\n\"Only that I cannot find it in me to do aught but agree with you,\" the\nlatter made reply. \"And I advise that we return, for had Tristram made\nhis journey hitherward we should long ago have had inkling of it.\"\n\n\"So then, we return today, friends,\" Arthur announced to his knights.\n\"We have it in us to hope that Percival and Launcelot have had better\nfortune than we.\"\n\nAnd none loath, the party joyously made preparations for return. It\nhad been an eventless search for the brave knight, Tristram, and these\nmen hated inactivity.\n\n\"What say you, to sending someone of us to Cadoris announcing that we\nshall pay him a visit of not more than a day?\" So queried the king.\n\n\"If there is promise of joust and adventure there,\" said Pellimore. \"I\nfor one can see no harm therein. What matters a day more or less?\"\n\nThe other knights agreed with Pellimore and as Gawaine pointed out, it\nwas not more than but few leagues from their returnward way.\n\nSo the party having first sent Sir Gilbert before them to herald their\napproach arrived at the court of Cadoris, king of Scotland. And never\nwas king or knights more royally received than was Arthur and his men.\nOf a truth, there was warm affection for Arthur, and Cadoris and his\nknights, though they held great rivalry, for the Knights of the Round\nTable had ever proven honest and worthy opponents.\n\nThe stay of the day stretched into the fourth day and not one of King\nArthur's party had thought of returning. Jousts were there, much\nhunting and activity, enough to suit the most exacting. Howsoever,\nArthur announced on the fifth day that they could stay but another\nday.\n\n\"Of a truth, am I downright sorry that you must depart. For highly\nhave I been honored by your visit, and as greatly have I enjoyed it.\"\nWarm spoken was Cadoris.\n\n\"And we shall remember your hospitality for many a day,\" replied\nArthur. \"If we but make you half as much at home when you visit us,\ngood Cadoris, we shall feel that we have accomplished much. Is it not\nso, friends?\"\n\n\"Truly,\" assented King Arthur's knights. \"And I would, your Majesty,\nthat you make that visit right soon,\" added Gawaine.\n\n\"That we surely will,\" replied Cadoris heartily.\n\nSo King Arthur and his men made their preparations having been much\ncheered by their stay. And they had turned to their last meal which\nwas a sumptuous one and were greatly enjoying it when a servant of\nKing Cadoris came into the great dining hall and whispered into the\near of Sir Donald, one of the bravest knights in the kingdom of\nScotland. He in turn, whispered the news to the king.\n\n\"There are two riders without, Arthur, who want word with you,\" the\nScottish King announced. \"Shall I ask them to wait until we finish\nthis meal? It were pity to disturb you now and I doubt not their\nmessage may wait.\"\n\n\"That may well be so, good friend. Yet, if it disturbs you not, I\nshall ask Gawaine here to see these men and find out what message they\nbear.\"\n\nCadoris nodded his head in assent and Gawaine thereupon hastened\noutside the dining hall.\n\nIt was none other than Allan he saw. Allan with Breunor le Noire.\nGreat was his surprise at seeing them and greater still, at their\naccount of what had occurred. And when he heard how Launcelot and\nPercival and the others, together with Sir Tristram were holding the\nvery castle of King Mark, he shook with a great laughter. So loud was\nthis that the kings and the knights at the dining table heard it and\nwondering greatly, hurried out to find the cause for it. Forgot their\nfood for the time being in their curiosity.\n\nThe king of Britain was no less surprised to see Allan and this\nstranger whom he but faintly recalled. And to him, to Cadoris, and the\nassembled knights, the two had to recount again what had occurred. And\nwhen the full gist of it came home, Arthur brought down a heavy hand\non the shoulder of Cadoris who was shaking with laughter and himself\nfell into a seat nearby for very faintness at his own mirth. While\nabout him there was great boisterousness and loud guffaws. A yeoman\nwho had listened eagerly to the account hurried without and himself\nrecounted to the men there what had happened at the court of King\nMark. So that there were great shouts, much merriment.\n\n\"To think,\" said King Arthur, \"a bare few took King Mark's own\ncastle. I marvel at their impudence and yet it is but what could be\nexpected from such as they.\"\n\n\"As for me,\" said Gawaine, \"I would give all I have to have been\nthere. And all I ever expect to have, to have been near Mark when he\nrealized what had happened.\"\n\n\"Yet,\" said Arthur now grown serious, \"let us hear what Allan and this\nother brave youth are here for. They did not come this great distance\nto tell us of their impudence. That, I'll swear.\"\n\n\"Nay, sire,\" said Allan, who was spokesman because of greater\nacquaintance with those assembled. \"Sir Percival and Sir Launcelot\nsent Breunor le Noire to you and me with him for aid. For King Mark,\nfurious at the sorry figure he makes has sworn vengeance and has laid\nsiege to those within his castle. Sir Launcelot sent us with this\nmessage. That while they could perhaps make their escape yet they\nthought that you would wish to come to their aid so that they need not\nrun from King Mark. For they wish to see that king, to look at him.\nHalf the jest they have played lies in that.\"\n\n\"That we will do, of course,\" replied Arthur. \"And though we must\nfirst return home to gather our men, yet we will do so quickly and\nhurry just as quickly to the court of Cornwall. For we too, would like\nto see Mark, and though we envy your party its good fortune, yet can\nwe share in the jest. Say you not so, friends?\n\n\"Aye, sire, that we do. Yet haste is indeed necessary.\" So spoke both\nPellimore and Gawaine.\n\n\"Methinks, it would be a right friendly act on your part, Arthur,\nshould you allow me and my men to accompany you. So then there will\nbe no need for you to first return home and thereby save time. For I\ntoo,\" added Cadoris, \"would like to call on Mark at this time.\"\n\n\"Come then,\" said King Arthur. \"It would not be in us to refuse you.\nLet us return to finish our food and both of you, we doubt not must be\nright hungry by now.\"\n\nSo all of them returned to the dining hall. And Gawaine found room\nnext to him for Allan and Breunor le Noire.\n\n\"How long Allan, is it since you left them?\" he asked.\n\n\"This is our third day,\" was the boy's reply.\n\n\"How did you escape the besiegers?\" Arthur, who with the rest was\nlistening now inquired.\n\n\"It was done at night, sire. We two climbed over the wall. Two yeomen\nhelped us over. One of King Mark's men saw us and at first mistook us\nfor men from his own camp. Him, Breunor le Noire, gave little time\nfor outcry. We gagged and bound him and then Walker and Gouvernail\nclimbed back for a long rope and lifted him over on the castle side.\nFor we had no wish to have King Mark's men find him and suspect that\nsome of those within had gone for aid.\"\n\nNow the meal was over. Within another hour King Cadoris had gathered\nfive hundred of his men. King Mark and his men would never have\nstomach for affray. When the afternoon's sun was in the low western\nsky, the rescuing party was well on its way.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\n\nIn King Mark's Castle\n\n\nSo we return to the doughty few who are behind the walls of the great\ncastle.\n\n\"We shall wear out these impudent knaves,\" King Mark had said after\nthe first great surprise. \"Surely they cannot expect to hold out for\nany great length of time.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" had agreed the ever present Pendore and Bertram. \"And when\nthey are overcome,\" Sir Pendore had added darkly, \"then shall we find\nour day has come. For Launcelot shall surely suffer.\"\n\nBut the days went and the besiegers found a far greater and more\nstubborn resistance than they had expected. Their losses were many,\ndue to the skillful archery of the few within. King Mark's castle was\nof the kind that could only be assailed at two points which was in\nitself great help to the besieged.\n\nIf, perchance, the men of King Mark had had greater stomach for the\nattack, things might have gone ill with those within. But there were\nmany of the men of this king who favored but little the quarrel with\nthe besieged, counting it, in their own hearts, a scurvy action on the\npart of Cornwall's king. And men fight poorly who have such thoughts.\n\nNot that all was well with those within. On this, the eighth day of\ntheir occupancy of the castle, the men were a haggard lot. Little\nsleep had they. Some of them had been wounded, wonder it was that\nthese were so few and that none were dead. Sir Neil was lost to them\nfor the time, Wonkin, too had fought heroically but had fallen, sorely\nwounded in an attack. Three others had been hurt, and for every man\nwho fell, there grew the greater burden on those who were left.\nConstant watch, constant need for being present to repel the attackers\nhad left the mark of weariness on Sir Launcelot, Sir Tristram and Sir\nPercival. Yet these three were a host in themselves as they, with\nGouvernail and Walker, set an inspiring example to the rest.\n\n\"Faith,\" said Sir Percival at this moment, \"I cannot say that I would\nnot welcome the arrival of Arthur and our men.\"\n\n\"I had never thought sleep so great a luxury,\" rejoined Sir Tristram.\n\n\"Nor I,\" added Sir Launcelot. \"However, do you both take such little\nof that now as those knaves who are on the outside permit.\"\n\nBut this neither of the two had in mind to do. Yet Sir Launcelot\ninsisted and only had his way when he promised that he would also take\ntime for sleep after them.\n\nThey had, so it seemed to them, but barely fallen asleep, when there\nwas great outcry from both within and without the gates. The men of\nKing Mark had evidently decided on a determined attack with full\nintention to overcome the stubborn few. In a great mass they came and\nthough many fell and every arrow told yet were they not to be denied.\nAnd as they came close to the walls King Mark's men opened wide their\nranks and a score of men were seen carrying a bridge to throw over in\nplace of the drawbridge which they could not reach.\n\n\"Now has it grown right serious,\" said Sir Launcelot.\n\n\"Will you Percival hold these walls while Tristram, I, Gouvernail and\nWalker, make every effort to see that the bridge does not stay.\"\n\nThere was no time for further words. The four quickly made for the\ngates. They opened and closed them quickly. Each held a stave that\nseemed not unlike a young tree, of which a number were inside the\ngates.\n\n\"Let them place the bridge first,\" said Sir Launcelot.\n\nUpon them a hail of arrows fell but none were hurt. Gouvernail and\nWalker were protected for the time in both coats and helmets of steel\nwhich Sir Tristram had made them wear.\n\nNow the men of King Mark had thrown the bridge over the embankment.\nBut as the first of them rushed upon it the thick staves of the four\nmen did their work well. Mighty work it was but it was question\nwhether there were four men in all of England who had greater strength\nthan these. And so as the men came rushing over, the bridge seemed\nmoving with them.\n\nA great outcry came from them. The new made bridge, moving slowly at\nfirst, now cleared its support, and fell into the depths below\ncarrying twenty men with it. Some managed to get back to safety, some,\nalmost as unfortunate as those who had fallen with the bridge, made\ntheir way to the castleside. These Sir Tristram and Sir Launcelot and\nthe two yeomen easily overcame.\n\nFrom the walls a hail of arrows, stones and javelins were sent on the\nattackers. The four outside the walls, their work accomplished,\nreturned within. But King Mark and his two lieutenants, of whom one\nhad been on the bridge, were now not the less determined to carry the\nwalls.\n\nThe besiegers at the furthermost points were seen to clamber over the\nwalls. They were battering at the gates at which Sir Tristram, Sir\nLauncelot and a number of the men had taken their stand.\n\nThings indeed looked dark for those within. Sir Percival, for one, had\nbeen grievously wounded in the last affray.\n\nBut the gates made to withstand against attack held well.\n\nYet it was now a mere question of time. This, both those within and\nwithout fully realized.\n\n\"Unless our two messengers find King Arthur,\" said Sir Tristram calmly\nand unhurriedly, \"it matters but little whether we fight our way out\nnow or later. Is it not so?\"\n\n\"I have faith in the coming of the king,\" said Sir Launcelot. \"For\nthe boy Allan, I know to be tireless in the performance of such duty.\nAnd if I mistake not the other will try his utmost too, for he seeks\nto be dubbed a knight by our king.\"\n\nSo now down at the gates, now on the walls, sending death and\ndestruction upon the attackers the two knights held their own,\nfighting hopefully, unyieldingly, hour after hour.\n\nThere was a cry of joy now, of exultation from Gouvernail. For his\neagle eye espied in the distance a horse and rider, then other horses\nand other riders.\n\nThe faint notes of the slughorn came to their ears. The men on the\noutside ceased their attack for the moment watching wonderingly, not\nguessing as yet what all this meant.\n\nFrom his bed of pain, not far off, Sir Percival called to the two\nknights.\n\n\"Is it Arthur who comes?\"\n\n\"Methinks so. Yet it seems I see the banners of Scotland. Whether it\nis men of Cadoris or of Arthur, of what matter?\"\n\n\"Aye, Launcelot, Scotland is there. But yonder figure is Arthur.\" So\nspoke Tristram.\n\n\"There too, is Gawaine and Pellimore. And there the boy, Allan. See\nyou him?\"\n\nSir Tristram nodded assent.\n\nNow Mark and his men gathered close together. The king and Sir Pendore\nand Sir Bertram were in close converse.\n\nUp to the walls came the rescuing party. King Arthur in front\nfrowning, mighty, a majestic figure who seemed to breathe fire and\nfury.\n\n\"What does this mean, Mark? What scurvy trick have you now tried?\"\n\n\"I found these men within holding my own castle when I returned from a\nshort journey. What else could I do but try to oust them?\"\n\n\"I know better. If any harm, if but one of my knights is hurt, I shall\nmake you pay right fully.\"\n\nNow the gates opened wide. There stood Sir Launcelot, and Sir\nTristram, both supporting Sir Percival. Into the castle rode King\nArthur and King Cadoris.\n\n\"Have you been hurt? Who else is wounded? Are any dead?\" These were\nthe questions of the king.\n\nSo Sir Launcelot told him. And now when the king found that none were\ndead and he realized how many men Mark had lost, good humor again came\nto him. His eyes twinkled merrily.\n\n\"Shall we hang this scurvy king?\" he asked.\n\n\"If you will, sire,\" said Sir Tristram. \"I fancy he has suffered much\nby now. And since he is uncle of mine I beg of you treat him more\ngently than he deserves. Let us rather laugh at him. True, there are\nsome of us who have been wounded, but none fatally.\"\n\n\"And after all,\" said Sir Percival, \"see how _much_ we can\nlaugh?\"\n\nSir Launcelot too nodded in agreement.\n\n\"In truth,\" King Arthur agreed, \"I have found no fancy to act as\nhangman to him. For knave and villain though he is, yet is he still a\nking. What say you Cadoris?\"\n\n\"It is no brew of mine, good Arthur. Yet were I he and you had such\ngood cause to laugh at me, I wonder if I would not rather hang.\"\n\nSo King Arthur turned to King Mark. Laughter was in his eye, mocking\nlaughter. About him the others gathered and these, too, seemed\nlaughing at him.\n\n\"I offer you advice, Mark, which so it seems to me, you would do well\nto heed. Keep not your doors so wide open hereafter. Knaves like these\nare too apt to accept such hospitality. And, good Mark, when next you\ngo a hunting, I fancy, you had best hunt at home. It is safer and for\none thing you are sure to have it. 'Tis a sad state for you to find\nthese men making themselves at home while you are away on so peaceful\na mission. 'Tis a sad pity and should not be permitted.\"\n\n\"Tis sad,'tis sad,\" said the men about King Arthur.\n\nKing Mark scowled in fury. And somehow, it seemed, he scowled most at\nhis own nephew, Tristram.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN\n\nThe Kitchen Boy Again\n\n\nNow King Arthur, his knights and all of his men were home once again.\nHere they found great good humor at their account of the adventure at\nthe castle of King Mark.\n\nTristram came with them. For many years thereafter he served under\nKing Arthur. Honor and glory he brought to the court of the King and\nArthur held him in high esteem as well he might. Between Launcelot and\nTristram there grew a great friendship. Each of them believed the\nother to be the greatest knight in Christendom.\n\nAnd Allan, too. Now he was a year older. The urge to go forth, strong\nwithin him, had grown that day a year earlier, when the strange monk\nhad met him in the forest and told him the things he might do. Youth\nthough he still was, not yet sixteen, he had learnt much. Sir\nLauncelot and Sir Tristram, too, had spent much time with him--could\nthere have been better teachers? Gouvernail and Walker, as well,\ntaught him to make the best use of such strength as he had. So that by\nnow he was the equal of many knights, better, too, though none of his\nteachers would let him know that, and he, secure in his own modesty,\nunknowing of his great prowess.\n\nThe year, too, had brought Sir Kay's kitchen boy once again before the\nKing. Him, Allan had learned to know. Although his friend had never\nadmitted that he was better than his position warranted, Allan was\ncertain of it. When Pentecost had come again he was curious as to what\nother boons were to be asked of the king by this kitchen boy.\n\nBut the day found him away--sent to the castle of Sir Percival, which\nwas a half day's journey. Yet was he not altogether disappointed, for\nat that castle was Yosalinde, Sir Percival's sister.\n\nAgain there were many who sought the favor of the King on this day.\nThere, too, were many knights present and among these were Sir\nGawaine, Sir Percival and Sir Launcelot, the three who had been there\nthe year before.\n\n\"And so, sire,\" the kitchen boy said, when the king turned to him, \"I\nhave done my work as best I could. Now I crave my two boons.\"\n\n\"These shall be yours, if we have it in us to grant you item. What are\nthese boons you ask?\"\n\n\"That I be made a knight by Sir Launcelot. Him and him only do I wish\nto dub me with knighthood. And that furthermore you permit me to take\nup the first adventure which may need knight to carry same.\"\n\n\"So shall it be. We pray you, however, that you give your name.\"\n\n\"That will I do, sire, after Sir Launcelot had jousted with me, if he\nthen finds me worthy of knighthood.\"\n\n\"Of a sooth,\" said Sir Kay, \"you ask not much. That so brave a knight\nshould joust with a kitchen boy is fit cause for merriment.\" Loud was\nthat knight's laughter but none joined with him.\n\n\"Mayhap,\" said the strange youth, \"it will be your pleasure to joust\nfirst with me.\"\n\nUncertain seemed Sir Kay for a few moments.\n\n\"I promise you, Sir Kay, mine is gentle blood, and you may well combat\nwith me,\" the kitchen boy added mildly.\n\nThen did the two straightway prepare, horse and armor having been\nobtained for the younger man.\n\nNot long did they battle however, for the kitchen boy proved Sir Kay's\nmaster right quickly. Whereupon, Sir Kay becoming furious, made great\nado to wound his opponent. But could not do so; instead, the other\nbrought him down with fearful stroke which crushed through helmet and\nall.\n\n\"If you please, now, Sir Launcelot, to joust with me, I shall find it\ngreat honor.\" So spoke the youth to the knight.\n\nThen there was such a battle as none had seen in many months. Neither\nof these two brought to play his full, strength, yet right cleverly,\neach struck, counterstruck and brought his skill to play. Much\nmarveled the knight at the youth.\n\nThen finally, Sir Launcelot said.\n\n\"Your quarrel and mine, youth, is not so sore, we may not leave off.\"\n\n\"Truly, that is truth,\" replied the lad. \"But it does me good to feel\nyour might.\"\n\n\"So tell me your name, that I may dub you knight. Right gladly will I\ndo so.\"\n\n\"My name,\" said the other, \"is Gareth. I am brother to Gawaine. I made\nvow to prove myself worthy of knighthood by finding myself able to\nundergo the mean tasks as well as the noble ones.\"\n\nSo Sir Gawaine came forward wonderingly, to see this brother whom he\nhad not seen since he was a babe.\n\nHe made him fond embrace. \"Right proud of you am I brother. Proud too,\nthat it is Launcelot, whose knight you shall be.\"\n\nThen Sir Gareth became knight. And as they made their way again into\nthe great hall, the King beckoned to Sir Gareth.\n\n\"Are you still of a mind to take on yourself the first adventure that\ncometh. For here is one that promises a lengthy time in its\nfulfillment.\"\n\nBefore the new knight could make answer, Sir Gawaine spoke.\n\n\"This sire, is Gareth, my youngest brother. Worthy of knighthood has\nhe proven so far as strength and skill go.\"\n\n\"Then are we right proud to have you among us, nephew. And we pray\nthat you will add lustre to your honored name and to the Round Table\nas well.\"\n\n\"That, I warrant, he will,\" vouchsafed Sir Launcelot. \"Perchance, it\nseemeth a wise thing to have Sir Kay feed all our knights in prospect\nthe same fat broth he has furnished Gareth.\"\n\n\"As to the adventure,\" the King returned. \"There came but a little\nwhile ago a maiden, Linet, by name, who craves that we send a knight\nto succor her sister, the fair Dame Lyoness who is besieged in her\ncastle by the Knight of the Red Lawns.\"\n\n\"Good herald,\" the King continued, \"bring you the lady, Linet before\nus.\"\n\nInto the great hall came a maiden fair. To her the king addressed\nhimself.\n\n\"My Lady Linet, and it please you, pray tell us of what manner of\nsiege this knight holds against your sister. If to you it seems of\navail, we shall be glad to send a goodly number of our knights and\nyeomen, too, to raise this siege.\"\n\n\"Nay sire, that I deem not necessary. Only, since I have heard that\nthe knights of the Round Table are the bravest and best in all\nBritain, I have come to you that you send one of these to battle with\nthe Knight of the Red Lawns. A stout knight is he, many have come to\nrescue the fair lady who is my sister but the way is perilous and he\nhath seven men's strength. So that I pray you to send the best and\nbravest knight who is here.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"My Lady, I Am Your Loyal Knight\"]\n\n\"We would gladly heed your request, good lady. Nor do we care what\nmanner of knight this is, if Sir Launcelot or Sir Tristram or any one\nof ten or twelve more were to go to your fair sister's rescue. But we\nhave made promise that the next adventure, which this is, was to be\ntaken up by Sir Gareth and unless he forego this, there is naught else\nleft for us to do. What say you, Gareth?\"\n\n\"I beg you, sire, that you permit me to carry out this adventure. I\nshall do my utmost to bring it to successful conclusion.\" So did\nGareth reply.\n\n\"And I for one, sire, doubt not, that if the adventure can be carried\nout successfully, he will do so. For he is as brave and stout a knight\nas is among us,\" added Sir Launcelot.\n\n\"Yet is he so young,\" said the maiden as she sighed. \"I doubt that any\nof you know how powerful is the knight he must oppose.\"\n\n\"Yet will he go,\" Arthur now decided. \"Make you your plans Gareth. The\nway seems long and I doubt not, you will be disposed to continue on\nadventure's course, if this should be carried to successful\nconclusion.\"\n\nNow the maiden left the great hall. Sir Gareth joined Sir Launcelot,\nSir Percival and his brother. As he did so, there came to him, Breunor\nle Noire.\n\n\"I pray you to favor me, good Sir Gareth by permitting me to go with\nyou and gather for myself such adventure as I may.\"\n\nSir Gareth pondered for a moment, then made reply.\n\n\"I had a mind to ask a boon of Sir Percival yet I can see no reason\nwhy it would interfere with your going.\"\n\n\"It is this, Sir Percival. I know how much your page Allan craves for\nsome adventurous journey before he also becomes knight. Be so kind,\ntherefore, and permit him to go with me.\"\n\n\"Truly, it will be Youth seeking adventure. For each of you is indeed\nyouthful.\" So spoke Sir Gawaine, while Sir Percival thought before\nmaking reply.\n\n\"What say you, Launcelot?\" he finally asked.\n\n\"It cannot harm the lad to go with others than ourselves for then he\nwill receive opportunity to test himself. I would say that you permit\nhim, if he wishes it.\"\n\n\"Then may he go,\" said Sir Percival. \"Except that I would wish that\none of my yeomen, whose name is Walker, go with you. You will find him\nuseful and a willing knave.\"\n\n\"For that I thank you,\" replied Gareth. \"Tomorrow, my friend,\" and he\nturned to Breunor, \"we begin our journey.\"\n\n\"I shall be ready,\" replied Breunor le Noire.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINETEEN\n\nOn Adventure's Way\n\n\nNow, as the knights separated, Sir Launcelot, who had donned but part\nof his armor, called Sir Gareth.\n\n\"I would a word with you, Gareth. I pray you to spare me the time.\"\n\n\"Right gladly,\" said Gareth and seated himself beside the other. Sir\nPercival, who had a mind to return to them, on seeing them so seated,\nswerved his horse and passed by them. Nor did they see him.\n\n\"See you this sword and shield. Take you these and use them well. They\nare good weapons and you will find the answering well to urge and\nparry.\n\n\"Yet it is something of far more urge than this that I would speak to\nyou about. I am right glad that you are to have Allan with you. I hope\nhe will find much adventure and many experiences. Listen well to\nthis.\"\n\nThen did Sir Launcelot tell of the message that had been given both to\nhim and the boy. Told also of the need for Allan to stay the fine and\ndevout lad he was.\n\n\"You can help, too. I made promise to Sir Joseph of Armathea that I\nwould do what I can. Since you are knight dubbed by me, I pray you to\nhelp me.\"\n\n\"That shall I do right gladly, for I like the youth and his kindly\nways. I give you my promise to give him by such example as I may set\nand in other ways the meaning of knighthood worthy of the search for\nthe Holy Grail.\"\n\n\"I wish you good fortune, Gareth, and that you overcome this knight of\nthe Red Lawns. If you should need aid at any time, I promise I will\ncome if I get word, no matter how distant you may be.\"\n\n\"I know that,\" said Gareth soberly. So then they sat for many moments\neach thinking of many things. Until at last it was time for them to\nseparate.\n\nAllan had returned a little while before. He had already heard who the\nkitchen boy was and how he had been dubbed knight by Sir Launcelot. It\nhad been a day of events for him, too. Walker, who had made the\njourney with him had talked with him of many things.\n\n\"This world is large,\" Walker had said.\n\n\"Soon,\" Allan had said, \"I shall go forth and find out for myself just\nhow large it is.\"\n\n\"Aye, lad,\" was Walker's reply, \"if you travel all the years you live\nI doubt if you could see half of it. Far to the southeast is Rome and\nthere are many lands one must pass before he reaches there. And to the\nnortheast live the Norse and the Dane and other tribes equally wild\nand fierce. Then there are many seas, which I have heard tell are\nbigger than the sea of Cornwall, which I know well. And west of us,\nthere is Ireland and beyond that the world ends.\"\n\n\"Yet shall I go and see what I can. For, if need be I must go to the\nvery ends of the world and I doubt not it will be right soon.\"\n\n\"Why, young master?\" asked Walker, struck by the seriousness of the\nboy's tone.\n\nBut Allan answered not. Nor did the man press his question but watched\nthe lad as he rode on and dreamed.\n\nSo they came to the castle. There Yosalinde was awaiting him. Yet\nafter the first greeting, the girl, whose usual contagion of high and\ngay spirits carried the youth, who was inclined to be more sober\nminded, along with her, fell into a brown study. Nor would she listen\nor attend to his attempts to bring her forth into lighter mood. So the\nboy, a little vexed and nettled, withdrew feeling hurt and gloomy.\n\nBut all this was soon swept aside. For Yosalinde came to him and in\nher eyes was a great light.\n\n\"Listen to me, Allan. I had mind made up at first that I would not\ntell you but have decided otherwise. I too, have dreamed of the Holy\nGrail. Does it not seem strange that I, a girl, should so do?\"\n\nThe boy nodded but remained quiet waiting for her to continue.\n\n\"You and I are to soon part, Allan. I am to go to a convent where I\ncan bring my mind altogether to the spiritual. I dreamed that when I\nbecame worthy I was to help you right well in the finding of it. A\nspirit will come to me which will guide us both. Think, Allan, if the\ndream is true, I am to help you and you are to find the Grail.\"\n\n\"So the strange monk told me, Yosalinde. He spoke of one who was to\nhelp me and she of whom he spoke, I could not take to be other than\nyou. You and one other and unless I mistake not that other is Sir\nLauncelot. But it hurts, this thought that you and I will not see each\nother for the long time you are in the convent.\"\n\n\"But, dear Allan, there is always that time beyond that. It is\nwonderful to look forward to that, is it not?\"\n\nThe boy nodded in assent, a little slowly, as if he were realizing\nthat it was so. He looked at the girl now and the feeling grew that\nYosalinde was to be the one who would lead him onward. Even now, her\nfine spirit was helping him to cross the first of the pitfalls. The\nwish for the girl was the first rung on the high ladder of worthiness.\n\nIn the late afternoon the boy returned to the court. Of a truth he had\nalmost forgotten that this was the day for the kitchen boy to come\nforth. Nor did he, what with thinking of Yosalinde and his mission\nthat must soon be, remember it until he had almost returned.\n\n\"Come Walker, let us make haste, for I would know the news.\"\n\nSo they hurried and had not been inside the gates many moments before\nAllan had found out. But it was only when he came to Sir Launcelot\nthat he heard the other news that he could go forth with the other two\non adventure's way.\n\nHe was glad that he could go with these two who were also young for he\ncould himself adventure so much the more readily. He would have been\nabashed to do so with knights such as his own lord or Sir Launcelot\nand Sir Gawaine.\n\nSir Launcelot found the boy soon after.\n\n\"When you return, and I think it will not be for more than a year,\nmayhap, two, the King will dub you knight, so I think. Remember Allan,\nto be worthy for the things ahead and remember, too, that I am at beck\nand call, if you need me, if so be you can find me.\n\n\"This journey will be the great test. I pray that you return and prove\nwhat I think you will be. Sir Percival, I understand has armor, sword,\nlance and spear for you. I shall furnish you with shield. So go you\nyour way and remember that there are few knights who will be found\nstouter or more skillful than Gareth.\"\n\nAllan found Gareth soon thereafter and thanked him for letting him go\nwith him. Then did the three, Sir Gareth, Breunor le Noire and Allan\nplan for many things. The blood of youth raced in their veins even as\nthey planned. Many things would they do. Britain would hear of these\nthree, so they hoped.\n\nA goodly trio, of a truth, they made as they rode forth the next day,\nthe maid Linet with them, and only Walker following behind. Three most\nworshipful knights watched them as they made their way down the long\nroad and disappeared from view.\n\nPerhaps, too, it was only chance that led them again past the castle\nof Sir Percival. There Allan made point to enter the same promising to\ncatch up with the others as they continued on their way. Nor could he\nstay more than but a few moments but in those few moments he had told\nall to Yosalinde. She, too, watched him, as he hastened to join the\nothers.\n\nLong before he returned she had entered the convent in accordance with\nthe plan of her mother and brother. Yet, in the heart of each of them\nwas only the thought of the future, their hopes were in the far away.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY\n\nGareth Battles Sir Brian\n\n\nBrave and adventurous were the days that followed. Many days they\njourneyed to the north. Eager was Sir Gareth to reach the castle of\nthe fair Dame Lyoness and to take issue with the Knight of the Red\nLawns, her oppressor.\n\n\"Yet, good knight,\" said the fair Lady Linet. \"Not an easy road will\nyou find it. There do be many brave knights you will find on this road\nwho will seek to joust with you. Many brave knights who seek\nadventure as do you.\"\n\n\"If it were not so, then would the way be long indeed. May such\nadventure come right soon, we shall welcome it.\" So spoke Gareth and\nhis two friends echoed his words.\n\nYet it was not until the second day that their wish was fulfilled. For\nas they rode forward there came a man in great haste toward them. He\nfurther increased his pace and gave a glad cry of relief.\n\nSaid Allan, who was foremost, \"What ails you. Why your haste?\"\n\n\"I have just escaped from some thieves who have entrapped my master.\nThey number six and fierce and sturdy did they seem. I beseech your\naid, good masters, for my master is a brave knight who has suffered\nmisfortune.\"\n\nSo then did the three, undecided for the moment, look to each other.\nUntil Breunor le Noire exclaimed.\n\n\"Let us to this knight's aid at once.\" The same thought being in the\nmind of the other two, they begged the Lady Linet to await them and\nhurried forward to this, their first adventure.\n\nBut the man who came to them, unknowingly, had misled them. For the\noutlaws numbered more than six as they soon found out. So that when\nthey came to the dell in which the thieves were lodged, the three of\nthem together with Walker, there came forth to oppose them over a\ndozen ruffians, each carrying either club or mace or spear.\n\nNow did the three give proof of their mettle. Walker, too, wielded a\nmighty mace that spelled sure death on any of the thieves whom it\nreached.\n\nRight skillfully, as if they were veterans, did they hold their place.\nRight well, they withstood the onslaught of the outlaws and even\npressed them back in defense.\n\nA number of the foe had fallen and others uncertain made as if to\nflee. But they could not go far, for the conquerers, mounted, overtook\nthem. So that there was nothing left for them to do but to turn with\ntheir backs to a nearby wall and make a last stand.\n\nNow there were but four of these ruffians left and these threw their\narms from them and pleaded mercy. And our youths took heed of their\nplea and permitted them to escape.\n\nThey made rescue of the imprisoned knight who marveled much, after his\nfirst expression of gratitude, how so youthful a trio could have\novercome the large number of outlaws. Then did he give further proof\nof his appreciation in that he begged of them that they make his home\ntheir abode for that night and he promised them food in plenty and\ngoodly lodging.\n\nThough they were of mind to accept they first besought the wishes of\nthe Lady Linet and she, they found, was not opposed thereto. Right\nwell did they sup then and made themselves find comfort before the\ngreat fire which blazed merrily. As the night went by, they talked of\nmany things and found their host full of tales of days gone by.\n\nThe next morn found them on their way again. Many days they journeyed.\nOther adventures befell them and in each they accredited themselves\nright well.\n\nOn one of these days, Breunor le Noire who had speeded ahead so that\nhe was an hour's journey before them had a sad adventure. For as he\nrode there came toward him an equipage which held many knights and the\nleader of these was none other than Sir Brian de les Isles.\n\nSo as Sir Brian saw him he rode toward him.\n\n\"Of what fellowship are you, youth?\"\n\n\"Of King Arthur's court and it is King Arthur himself who will soon\nmake me his own knight.\"\n\n\"Ill will do I owe this king of yours and all who hold lealty to him.\nTherefor will I imprison you.\"\n\nBut this they found not quite so easy. Well did the youth oppose them,\nand many of them suffered thereby. Until there were those among them\nwho were ready to believe that this was no youth in life but fiend\ninstead.\n\nYet did he at last succumb because their number was so many. And then\ndid Sir Brian cast him into a prison where Breunor found as many as\nthirty knights who were prisoners of Sir Brian, some of these were\nknights of the Round Table.\n\nSoon Gareth and Allan speeded their way to overtake Breunor le Noire\nof whose absence they began to wonder. Nor did they find trace of him\nanywhere. Until Allan suggested that they return to the large castle\nwhich they had passed, where trace of their comrade might be.\n\nSo then did Sir Gareth come to the castle gates; Allan with him. To\nhis beckoning there came forth one of Sir Brian's henchmen.\n\n\"Tell your master, Sir Gareth waits outside the gates and would\nbespeak him.\"\n\nBut when Sir Brian was given the message, he did not deign to answer\nin person, instead, he sent one of his knights in answer to the call.\n\n\"Sir Knight,\" addressed Sir Gareth, \"I seek the master of this castle.\nAre you he?\"\n\n\"Nay, but then Sir Brian deems it not fit for him to answer all calls.\nSuch business as you may have, I doubt not, I may quickly dispose with\nand so not keep you from your journey.\"\n\n\"I seek a youth, companion of ours, who had strayed from us and who\nmayhap, has met with foul adventure. His name is Breunor le Noire. Do\nyou or the knight who is your master here know aught of him?\" So spoke\nSir Gareth disdaining the insolence in the tone of the other.\n\n\"It may be that we do. Wait you here, while I make return to the\ncastle to find the answer for you.\"\n\nTherewith the knight left them to stand in front of the castle gates\nand made his own way back to the house.\n\n\"He is an ill bred knave,\" said Allan hotly. \"To think that such as he\nholds knighthood.\"\n\n\"Knighthood,\" said the ex-kitchen boy, \"is merely a cloak. And I find,\nAllan, that it is a garment that is only seemly when he who dons it\nwears it well. Yet this is no time for anger. Of what matter that this\nknight is ill bred. If there is any quarrel I shall seek it with his\nmaster.\"\n\n\"Think you that they know of his whereabouts?\" asked Allan. \"I liked\nnot the manner in which he made answer.\"\n\n\"Nor I. But I doubt not we shall know more surely within the next few\nmoments.\"\n\nNor did the two have long to wait. For there came from the castle\nanother who seemed to be the high lord. In armor and shield, carrying\nlance and riding a great black horse, he stood out from among the\nknights who followed him.\n\nWhen he came to the gates they were opened wide for him. Then as he\nsaw Sir Gareth and the boy, he made them a sweeping courtesy.\n\n\"Forgive our boorishness, Sir Gareth. Pray to enter our humble\nlodging. Are you then Prince of Orkney?\"\n\n\"I am so known,\" replied the young knight. \"Yet I seek to be known as\nGareth, Knight of the Round Table. I know not your name, Sir Knight,\nbut I find your courtesy welcome.\"\n\nBut now Allan had noted how the knight's manner had changed. No longer\ndid he seem kindly; instead a dark scowl frowned his face.\n\n\"I am Sir Brian de les Isles,\" was the answer. But the voice was no\nlonger a voice that welcomed, instead it was menacing and stern.\n\nBut Sir Gareth seemed to take no note of this. \"I seek, Sir Brian, to\nfind a youth who accompanied us. His name is Breunor le Noire, and he\nseemed to have met with foul adventure.\"\n\n\"Not foul, Sir Gareth, but only such as is meet for all of King\nArthur's henchmen.\"\n\n\"Then, I take it, you know of him and of his whereabouts,\" said Sir\nGareth. Still was his manner mild, yet forked lightning seemed to\nflash from his eyes.\n\n\"That we do,\" replied the other. \"He is indeed in safe keeping, such\nkeeping being no other than ours.\"\n\n\"I must trouble you, Sir Knight, to make return of him to us.\"\n\n\"And if I will not?\" questioned Sir Brian. Insolence was in his tone,\na sneering smile was on his lips.\n\n\"I take it, if you will not release him you will fight me as would any\nhonorable knight.\"\n\n\"That will I. Right gladly and to the uttermost, Sir Gareth. For all\nknights of the Round Table, I am sworn foe.\"\n\nThen there began a battle such as there was seldom seen. Confidence\nwas in Sir Brian's every move, and truly it would seem that this young\nknight, still unknown in the field of chivalry, was but a poor\nadversary to one of the best known of England's knights.\n\nBut if Sir Gareth was young, if he was but little known, yet the skill\nat which Sir Launcelot had marveled, stood him in good stead. This,\nSir Brian soon realized. As steel met steel, the older knight knew\nthat his adversary was no mean one.\n\nSo they battled for a time, neither of them gaining advantage over the\nother. Great strength was Sir Brian's, but it was matched by skill and\nquickness of thrust and parry.\n\nAllan, a lone figure, the only one of the group assembled to stand for\nSir Gareth, watched the struggle with bated breath. This boy who had\nseen men like Sir Launcelot, Sir Tristram, Sir Percival and others of\nalmost equal repute, found his friend no less able and bold. Clenched\nwere his hands, tense the boyish figure, as with heart and soul afire\nhe watched the two knights.\n\nBut soon it became evident that unless untoward happening occurred the\noutcome of the brave fight was but a matter of time. Slowly, yet\nsurely Sir Brian gave ground. Slowly but surely Sir Gareth pressed\nhim. All the cunning of his foe availed him naught. To the last Sir\nBrian fought bitterly, silently. His heart held bitterness over the\nprobable outcome, over the youthfulness of the victor to be.\n\nNow as he parried a bold stroke of the other, for each of them had\nturned to swords long before, there came a flash of steel and Sir\nBrian felt a great nausea overcome him. Then he knew nothing more for\na long time.\n\nHe came to later. Eager hands were ministering to him. Feebly he\nturned, not knowing for the moment why all of this should be. Then his\neyes beheld the victor and the boy next to him and he realized what\nhad taken place.\n\n\"Sir Gareth,\" he murmured, as his knights moved aside in response to\nthe weak gesture of his hand, \"yours are a victor's spoils. Well have\nyou fought and won.\"\n\n\"Sir Brian,\" the other replied, \"I seek but Breunor le Noire and the\nrelease of such knights as you may hold who owe lealty to king Arthur.\nYou are a brave knight, would that your cause were worthy you.\"\n\nNow Sir Brian called one of his knights to him. The latter followed by\nSir Gareth and Allan made their way to the dungeon of the castle.\nThere they found their companion, there too, they found the other\nknights of the Round Table who had been made prisoners by those within\nthe castle. Great was their joy at release and warmly they thanked\ntheir fellow knight.\n\nAnd now there came a knight to them and told of how well Breunor had\nfought and what difficulty they had had to make him prisoner.\n\n\"If this youth fights but half as well as do the two we have seen, you\ndo indeed make a formidable trio.\"\n\nThen the three rejoined the Lady Linet and the next morn they were\nwell on their way.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\n\nKnight of the Red Lawns\n\n\nEvents followed swiftly thereafter for their journey toward the castle\nof the Dame Lyoness was not made on easy road. Yet through all these,\ngood fortune stayed with them and so at least they were within a day's\njourney of their destination.\n\nWord had come to the Red Knight of the Red Lawns of the coming of Sir\nGareth. Word too had come to him of the brave deeds of this knight and\nhis two companions. Yet did the Red Knight find naught in it all but\ncause for great merriment.\n\n\"Truly will their courage ooze from them when they behold those many\nknights hanging from yonder oaks, knights who thought to battle with\nme and so rescue the Dame Lyoness. Nor did I blame them overmuch, for\nit is well worth hanging for, perchance to win a smile from so fair a\nlady. Would that I could be so fortunate.\"\n\nSo said the Red Knight and sighed. No crueler knight there was in all\nof Christendom yet was he gentle minded in his love for his fair lady.\nAnd though he would not free her of his presence and though he held\nher closely besieged within the castle, yet had he no desire that harm\nshould come to her.\n\nNow he again made his way to her castle wall where his herald did blow\nhis slughorn and announce that the Red Knight of the Red Lawns\nbesought the light of the lady's countenance and also word with her.\n\nAfter a due wait there came forth on a balcony within the wall a lady\nwho was indeed beautiful. Straight she held herself, straight and\ndirect her look. Soft brown hair, and her eyes shaded from a dark to\nlighter brown as they flashed her moods.\n\nFine was her face, a face of true nobility and gentleness.\n\nAnd as the Red Knight beheld her, his voice grew gentle, his words\nstrangely softspoken.\n\n\"My lady, I am your loyal knight. I pray you to listen to me as I\npledge again my loyalty and homage.\"\n\nThere was scorn in the lady's voice, as she cast a withering look upon\nthe knight.\n\n\"Soft are your words, Sir Knight. Yet if I do not do the cat a great\ninjustice it is the same softness as is hers when she spies her prey.\nFor yonder I have proof of such knighthood as is yours.\" And Dame\nLyoness pointed to the dead knights hanging from the trees.\n\n\"Aye,\" replied the Red Knight, \"and I would go further, I would tear\nsuch as would deign to keep me from you, limb from limb. Yet, gentle\nlady, have I ever shown you proper courtesy and respect as you may\nwell testify. What, I pray you, keeps me from entering this castle now\nand taking you by force, if need be?\"\n\n\"My lord,\" answered Dame Lyoness simply, \"that moment you enter these\ngates I shall drink this brew. A brew that will quickly dispose of all\nthe misery that this earth holds for me. Then will you be able to\nclaim my dead body but naught else. If hope were not mine, if I did\nnot feel certain that some brave knight would come here from King\nArthur's court to rescue me from your unwelcome presence, a knight\nsent here at the beseeching of my sister Linet, I would long ago have\ndrunk this poison and so rid the world of one who has brought naught\nbut misery to many brave knights.\"\n\n[Illustration: He Knocked With The Hilt Of His Sword]\n\n\"Lady,\" the Red Knight rejoined, \"I hear that such a knight is now on\nhis way. Yet have you overmuch faith in him or mayhap I have given you\npoor proof of my own skill and strength. If he should come, if his\nblood does not turn to water, think you he will win from the Red\nKnight?\"\n\n\"Yet do I so hope. I pray that he has greater skill and strength than\nyours. And I shall dare hope.\"\n\nThen did the lady turn and make her way within, giving the knight no\nfurther glance. Ruefully he turned away, and so woeful a figure that\nfew would have known him for the brave and commanding Red Knight of\nthe Red Lawns.\n\nThere came the Lady Linet first of all our party of five. She it was\nwho entered the gates of the castle of Dame Lyoness unmolested. So had\nit been arranged. There she recounted of Sir Gareth and of the others,\ntoo. She told of the knight's bravery and how he had overcome Sir\nBrian de les Isles, and of all their other adventures. Told too, of\nwho Sir Gareth was, and how gentle and how eager he was to take up her\ngauntlet. Until Dame Lyoness' eyes grew large and their shade dark\nbrown. For she was overly pleased at the description of her champion.\n\n\"Yet must he be of the strongest and most skillful,\" she said\nfearfully, \"to overcome this cruel knight. For the Red Knight is far\nsuperior to even Sir Brian.\"\n\n\"Dear Sister,\" replied Linet, \"I have faith in this youthful knight.\nNaught has he found too difficult as yet and I do not fear the Red\nKnight whom he meets tomorrow.\"\n\nSo the next morning, Sir Gareth arrived. Awaited him the Red Knight of\nthe Red Lawns who had been advised of his nearness.\n\nAs the lady's champion turned with the road, Allan, Breunor and Walker\nwith him, there rode forward to meet him, the knight he was to do\nbattle with.\n\n\"What brings you here?\" asked the Red Knight, though he knew full\nwell.\n\n\"I come to the rescue of Dame Lyoness, who, it seems, is besieged by\nsome unworthy knight who finds it worthy him to war on women.\"\n\n\"I am the Red Knight,\" the other replied without parley. \"See you, my\nfair knight, yonder trees. See you the things that hang therefrom.\nThey are the bodies of such other fools who have come here to teach me\nwhat I may or may not do.\"\n\n\"That, too,\" replied Sir Gareth, \"makes me but doubly certain that\nknighthood is not the garment you should wear. I shall do battle with\nyou, Sir Knight, so soon as you don armor. Meantime I await your\npleasure.\"\n\nThen did the three ride toward the castle. And as they neared it there\ncame to the open window both the Lady Linet and the Dame Lyoness. Low\ndid the latter courtesy to them all, but chiefest to Sir Gareth. Long\ndid these two gaze at each other and in that gaze love was in the\ndawning.\n\nNow, the Red Knight came forward. For a few moments each watched the\nother, their horses stepping now this way, now that. Then of a sudden,\nthey made at each other, with all their might. And well it was that\nshields were there to meet the blows. For such was their force that\nbreast plates, horsegirths and cruppers burst. Both knights were sent\nto earth, Sir Gareth holding the reins of his bridle still in his\nhands. Sore stunned was each for many minutes. Wonder it was that neck\nof either was not broken.\n\nNow the two left their horses and with shields in front they battled\nwith their swords. And they fought until midday and until they both\nlacked wind. So that each was forced to take rest.\n\nFrom their window, the two ladies watched the affray. Both of them\nprayed that harm should not come to their champion.\n\nBut the Red Knight watching them and seeing how in especial Dame\nLyoness was interested, conceived a new idea.\n\n\"I fancy that when I overcome this knight and prepare to hang him,\nyonder good lady will give herself to me to save him. For she seems\nto care overmuch for him and greatly do I wish I were in his place.\nYet must she be the lady of the Red Knight.\" So he mused.\n\nThey fought all of the afternoon. Now one would grovel in the earth,\nthe other too weak to carry the battle to successful conclusion, now\nthe second would grow equally weak.\n\nThen did they rest again and Breunor and Allan brought water for Sir\nGareth so that he could drink and bathe his face. They rested for a\nhalf hour and then battled once again.\n\nNow the younger knight seemed weaker. The Red Knight pressed him hard\nas he saw this. Things began to look dark for the lady's champion.\n\nShe, too, saw this. And coming far to the edge of the balcony she\ncalled out.\n\n\"Sir Gareth, I pray for your success.\" And as he looked toward her\nthere was a great, eager light on her countenance. It gave to him\nrenewed strength, renewed faith. As if he had ten men's strength. And\nso he turned on the Red Knight and the other could not withstay him.\nFearfully he struck him, such a fearful blow that the Red Knight never\nmoved again. Yet even as his foe succumbed, the victor slowly\ncrumbled to the ground, spent and so weak that for a few seconds\nAllan, Breunor le Noire and the two ladies who had hurried to him,\nthought he was dead.\n\nIn a few moments however the young knight opened his eyes. Then,\nbeholding the gentle face of Dame Lyoness, he closed them again, well\ncontent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\n\nSir Galahad\n\n\nOf the things that befell Sir Gareth, of how he wedded the good Dame\nLyoness and of how he gave right seemly proof of his worship, this\nstory will not detail. Nor can we go on the byway that deals with the\ndeeds of Breunor le Noire who was made a knight of the Round Table by\nKing Arthur soon thereafter and who then avenged the cowardly slaying\nof his father by the unknown and false knight.\n\nFor our tale must hold its course hereafter. The boy Allan had grown\nwith the two years that had passed since the adventure of the Red\nKnight of the Red Lawns. He had not returned to the court of King\nArthur, instead he and Walker had set out on journey of adventure. No\nhit and miss journey this, instead it followed a call that the boy had\nhad, a call which he knew meant that the time had come for him to\nbegin seeking the Holy Grail.\n\nThe two years had been eventful ones for Allan. All over England had\nhe found his way, he and Walker. Adventures were many and everywhere\nthis youth through kindly deeds and brave actions left good repute\nbehind him.\n\nSo at the period which our narrative now covers there had grown from a\nwhispering into a more or less certainty and belief that a man had\ncome who would find the Holy Grail again for Britain and so add honor\nand fame to England. And therewith there was great wonderment as to\nwhether the finder would be of the court of Northgalis, or of\nNorthumberland, or of Cornwall, or of Arthur's court.\n\nPentecost was but a few days away. Now on this day the good King\nArthur with Launcelot, Percival and Merlin, the wizard, made the round\nof the sieges or seats of the Round Table, each of which held a name,\nfor on this Pentecost to come, there were to be many new knights made\nand place must be found for them.\n\nSo then here and there the places were assigned. Now they came to the\nlast of the places.\n\n\"What new knight shall be placed here?\" asked the King. \"It seems to\nus that this place his been empty this long time.\"\n\n\"This,\" answered Merlin, \"is the Siege Perilous. Here no one shall sit\nuntil four hundred and fifty four years after the passion of the\nLord.\"\n\nNow then Sir Launcelot make quick reckoning.\n\n\"In the name of God,\" he made haste to say, \"then should this siege be\nfilled on this Pentecost day that comes.\"\n\n\"That I doubt not,\" replied Merlin, \"And no one else but the rightful\noccupant may fill it for he that is so hardy as to try it, he will be\ndestroyed.\"\n\nSo Pentecost day came. And all but Merlin wondered as to who the\nnewcomer, who would fill this seat could be.\n\nEarly day found the new knights already seated. Early day, too, found\nAllan, once again, after the many months away from the court,\nreturned. This was home to him--and close to three years had passed\nsince he had been there. He had learned much, he had searched thus far\nin vain for the Holy Grail. Yet not altogether in vain, for he felt\nwithin him that he was closer to his quest with the passing of each\nday. The boy, now in young manhood, had indeed developed well. Broad\nshouldered, slim-waisted, supple limbed, he gave little indication of\nhis strength, yet Walker riding close beside him, had watched him, had\ntrained him and had with great pride, noted his skill with lance,\nsword and spear. Well he knew that this youth would soon be second to\nnone in ability to cope with foe or in friendly jousting as might\nbefall in tournament or elsewhere.\n\n[Illustration: A Solitary Horseman]\n\nNow on this Pentecost day, Allan had returned because it was wont that\nhe should do so and also because desire urged him thence. So then he\nentered the great hall and because all of King Arthur's court were\nwithin, none there were who knew him.\n\nAnd once he found himself within, only Merlin the Wizard knew who he\nwas. The others knew him not, not even Sir Percival nor Sir Launcelot.\nSo Merlin came forward and greeted him.\n\n\"They do not yet know you lad, for greatly have you changed with these\nfew years. Almost grown to full manhood and of a truth full well and\nready for the further conduct of your mission. Come you with me for\nyour seat is saved.\"\n\n\"Nay, sir, I hold no seat for I am as yet no knight, though hopeful,\"\nreplied the lad.\n\n\"Yet is your place here, lad. So come.\"\n\nAnd herewith the lad had need to follow. While all about, the knights\nand others watched them both.\n\nSo now as they came to the Siege Perilous, Merlin stopped and motioned\nAllan toward it. Yet the boy hesitated and turned his eyes to his\nking, whose eyes searched both the Wizard and the boy.\n\nThereupon Merlin turned to them all.\n\n\"Here is Galahad, he who shall achieve the Grail. And proof of it is\nin this that he shall sit in the Siege Perilous and no harm shall come\nto him therewith. Sit you down, lad.\"\n\nSo Allan sat down in the place assigned. There seemed to play about\nhim and the seat a strange light. Well be seemed to fit therein.\n\n\"Oh, King,\" went on Merlin. \"Some years since, there came a stranger\nto this youth and also to one other here. There and then he declared\nthat the finding of the Grail was made possible. That the finder was\nto be known as Galahad the Chaste. Pure and upright must the seeker be\nand up to now there is none other among you who so well fills this\nrequirement. He who left here as Allan, page to Sir Percival,\nreturns, fitted and grown to the task. He shall henceward be known as\nGalahad. And it please you sire, make you him a knight of the Round\nTable. So that if he do find the Grail, honor and glory shall be with\nyou, too.\"\n\nWondered the boy yet, but at word from the king he came forward and\nknelt.\n\n\"We dub you knight, Allan. You shall be known as Sir Galahad. Fruitful\nmay your mission be. We know that knighthood shall not suffer through\nyou.\"\n\nA little apart, Sir Launcelot watched the boy. And though the newly\nmade knight knew it not, the former had watched him through the many\ndays he had been away from the court, had never been very far, yet\nnever so near that the young adventurer knew it. Most keen and\nwatchful had he been to see that the lad kept on the clean road ahead.\nAnd of a truth he had noted, with a restful content, that such was the\nboy's inclination and desires. Yet he kept apart even as he watched\nand in all the years had not come face to face with the boy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-THREE\n\nThe Beginning of the Quest\n\n\nA week and a day Sir Galahad stayed at the court. Nor was he there\nmany hours before he found that Yosalinde was not home as yet but\nwould be within the month. Yet he would not stay, for after long and\nserious converse with both Merlin and Sir Launcelot, he followed the\ngreat urge to go forward. For he felt the call now greater, more\ninsistent. Yet did he somewhat fret since this urge, this call seemed\nto lead him nowhere, seemed only to beckon that he go.\n\n\"Fret not, lad, perhaps many a year shall you wander before you find\nthe Grail. Many places shall you go. Yet let not your way ever be\nimpatient.\" So spoke the Wizard.\n\n\"I go to Normandy soon, Merlin.\"\n\n\"You shall find me there,\" now spoke Sir Launcelot, \"for I too go\nhither to seek adventure. I pray that we meet, Galahad and that\ntogether we have many eventful days. Though full well do I know your\nway in great part, must be alone.\"\n\n\"That it must be,\" Merlin advised.\n\nAnd so the next day and the next he stayed. From everyone and\neverywhere great favor was his. King Arthur, too, held much converse\nwith him and he remembered the first days the lad had come to court\nand how he had ordered the herald to send him forth for Sir Launcelot\nand Gawaine.\n\nBut the day came at last when he and Walker adventured forth. And the\nnew knight carried no shield for one was awaiting him, a shield that\ncarried a great cross to signify his seeking. This he was to find at\nthe convent near Carboneck. So Merlin had advised him.\n\nTwo days of journey passed without ontoward event but on the third day\nthere came to him a yeoman in great woe.\n\n\"What grieves you, friend?\" asked Walker while Sir Galahad waited.\n\n\"Great are my troubles for my master will surely flay me until I die.\nI was bringing him his best horse from the castle when a knight\nstopped me. Though I told him that the horse was my master's and how\nmuch store he set by it yet did he take the same from me. When I\nprotested as best I might, he brought his sword upon me and it was\nfortune that I was not slain.\"\n\n\"Know you the knight?\" asked Sir Galahad kindly.\n\n\"Nay, Sir, except that he told me he needed the horse at Calomet.\"\n\n\"I shall go hither. It is but a short journey and you may come with\nme. For it does not seem a knightly act, this taking of your master's\nhorse and it needs explaining.\"\n\n\"I thank you master. For little value though my life may be, I value\nit nevertheless,\" replied the yeoman.\n\nSo they went on to Calomet. And when they arrived there the yeoman\nmost fortunately espied his master's horse.\n\n\"Yonder, Sir Knight, is the horse,\" and he pointed excitedly.\n\nThere stood a white horse, truly a beast well worth owning. A\nbeautiful head, a great body that showed strength and grace, set well\non strong, shapely limbs. A head which its owner held right\nfearlessly, yet the eyes of the beast were soft and kindly and\nindicated that he could be ridden by child or woman.\n\n\"A good beast and well worth fighting for, if need be,\" said Walker.\n\n\"Yet more worthy the fight, if there is need of one, the fact that\nthis knight we are to meet is so unfair,\" replied Sir Galahad.\n\nSo now they came to the house. Walker and the yeoman dismounted and\nwent up to the horse, which had been tied but temporarily and was\nawaiting its rider.\n\nAnd as they stood there, there came from within the house a knight who\nhad espied them.\n\n\"What wish you, knaves?\" he asked, scowling.\n\n\"It is my master who wishes your presence,\" replied Walker.\n\n\"He shall have his wish satisfied,\" the knight made reply, turning to\nGalahad, who was a little further away.\n\n\"Do you wish word with me, Sir Knight?\" he asked.\n\n\"I seek him who claims to be the owner of this horse,\" replied Sir\nGalahad.\n\n\"Then you have found him for he is no other than I,\" was the answer.\n\n\"Yet how can he be yours, Sir Knight, if this yeoman claims it is his\nmaster's horse?\" Sir Galahad questioned.\n\n\"I have made you answer to question that should concern you but\nlittle. What ado wish you to make of it?\"\n\n\"Only that the horse goes to this yeoman so that he can bring him to\nhis rightful owner.\"\n\nThe other laughed aloud.\n\n\"I wot, strange knight, I wonder well how you can do this thing when I\nam here to say you nay. And when my sword is even more severe in\nkeeping you from boastful attempt.\"\n\nAnd then without further parley the knight brought his sword to play.\nBut sorry adventure this for him and Sir Galahad though still without\nshield brought him right quickly to earth. A sorry match was he for\nthe young knight, so ill matched that Walker smiled in glee at his\nefforts.\n\nThe knight now held his peace as Sir Galahad told the yeoman to take\nhis master's horse and go hence. But he scowled and as Sir Galahad\nturned to go he bespoke him.\n\n\"Sir Knight, I shall not forget your meddling in what was of no\nconcern to you. And the day may come when you will regret this deed.\"\n\n[Illustration: Sir Galahad In The Forest]\n\n\"True, Sir Knight,\" replied Sir Galahad. \"I shall have need to make\nassurance that my horse is secured so that he may not be stolen.\" And\nlaughing and full at ease he left the beaten knight to his surly\nthoughts.\n\nYet as he went the strange yeoman followed him. So that Sir Galahad\nturned to him somewhat in amaze.\n\n\"I thought that your way was opposite.\"\n\n\"My way, Sir Knight, goes only to yonder turn. Yet before I leave I\nmake you gift of this horse. He is yours. That was not a true tale as\nto who owned this horse. For its true owner is none other than you and\nmy story such as to test you and find answer to whether you would help\nthose who are in trouble, though the trouble owner be lowly born. The\nhorse is sent by friend of yours whose name is not to be related. I\nwish you well, Sir Knight.\"\n\nMuch overcome was Sir Galahad at the princely gift, for the horse had\nimpressed him much.\n\n\"Tell you this unknown friend of mine, that I value this gift as\nnaught else. Tell you too, that I name him the Seeker, in full honor\nof my quest.\"\n\nSo then the strange yeoman departed whilst the knight and his faithful\nman went on their way.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\n\nIn Normandy\n\n\nOf the travels of Sir Galahad, of how he journeyed through many lands\nand new scenes, there is much to be told. Ever with him, went his\nfaithful man, Walker, who served him well and loyally.\n\nEager was the young knight to reach Normandy of which he had heard\nmuch. So he sailed away and since many rumors held the Grail to be\nthere he hoped to find it.\n\nIn Normandy, a strange land, he met with much adventure, many knights\nbrave and true, and some who were not. But no sign of the Grail was\nthere to be had.\n\nOn his white horse, the Seeker, he made his way southward, finding\nlodging where he could.\n\nIt was so, in the first month of his travels, that he came to the\ncastle of one of the best of Normandy's knights. Of him, Sir Launcelot\nhad spoken highly; he held him in great esteem, and so had counseled\nthe youthful knight to make it his purpose to visit him when there.\n\nSir Guilbert gave him friendly greeting. Many had been his visits to\nEngland, well he knew Sir Launcelot and Sir Percival and the great\nKing himself. Sir Galahad found his stay a pleasant one; there were\nfriendly jousts in which he met some of Normandy's worshipful knights.\nIn all of these he was victor.\n\nSir Guilbert had full praise for the young knight. There was son of\nhis, a youth of seventeen, who also admired the newcomer, even as\nAllan the boy had admired Sir Launcelot. When his visitor's stay was\ndrawing to a close, Sir Guilbert spoke of this.\n\n\"My son Charles, Sir Galahad, has taken great fancy to you and wishful\nam I that you could find it in your plans to take him as page. He is a\nquiet lad, sturdy and obedient, you will find. And following wish of\nhis mother, he knows your English tongue well, for she is Englishborn.\nHe has made study of Latin too, it seemed for a time that he would\nturn to priesthood. But that will not be, and I cannot say that it\nfinds me regretful. I would have him a true knight, had I my way.\"\n\n\"Your wish, Sir Guilbert, may well be served. But if I may, I should\nlike first to speak to the lad, before I make answer.\"\n\n\"Faith, and you may. For we should want the lad to satisfy you and\nmerit your friendship. I shall see to it that you have the chance to\nspeak with him. It were better, that he know not the reason for your\nquestioning. Is it not so?\"\n\n\"It would be best, Sir Guilbert,\" Sir Galahad replied.\n\nThen the two talked of other things and the young knight questioned\nhis friend as to the likely whereabouts of the Holy Grail.\n\n\"Many rumors have I heard, Sir Galahad. But never actual trace.\nUnderstand you well, my friend. Knights from every land seek this\nGrail and I would wish that it were Norman who found it. But if it\ncannot be one from my own land, I would it were one from your country.\nI fear me, it shall not be easy search, it may lead you far.\"\n\n\"I am well prepared for that,\" replied the Seeker. \"If it were easy to\nfind, the glory would be so much the less. I can but hope that I shall\nhave the vision to see it when it is near me.\"\n\n\"I wish you well,\" Sir Guilbert made answer. \"Now let us repair to the\ndining hall for the meal waits.\"\n\nIt was after they had eaten that Sir Galahad found the opportunity to\nhold speech with the youth, Charles.\n\nHe found the lad to be all that his father had said of him.\n\n\"What have you wish for, Charles?\" he said.\n\n\"I should like to journey far and to many places,\" the boy replied.\n\"There is much to see and I envy the many who have traveled to foreign\nlands.\"\n\n\"How then, if you could, would you travel?\"\n\n\"As a true Norman knight serving God and the Church against all\ninfidels.\"\n\n\"Well spoken, lad. But it needs many years and one must learn much to\nbe a good knight. It is not easy work.\"\n\n\"I know that, Sir Galahad. But I shall not count the years for I am\nstill young.\"\n\nMore questions the knight asked the lad and he made eager though\nrespectful answer. It was apparent that he had thought of it for many\na day. But Sir Galahad said never a word to him of the reason for his\nquestions and left the lad without knowledge of his purpose.\n\nBut the next day he spoke to Sir Guilbert and gave him answer.\n\n\"I should like the youth as my page. He is the kind I could well use.\nAnd I promise you that he shall come back to you so that neither you\nnor his mother shall have reason to be other than proud of him. He\nwill be of great help to me when I reach Rome for I purpose to journey\nthere, I know naught of the tongue.\"\n\n\"Have you told the lad, as yet?\" the father asked.\n\n\"I thought it best that either you or your lady speak first with him\nand then will I.\"\n\n\"That is a gracious deed on your part, my knight. And if it bears\nfruit or not, I shall indeed be in your debt.\"\n\n\"Not so, Sir Guilbert. For the boy will but have such chance as I was\ngiven by Sir Percival when I was even younger than he.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE\n\nSir Galahad Offers Help\n\n\nIt was but a week and a day later that Sir Galahad proceeded further.\nWith him was the faithful Walker who was overly pleased to be on his\nway and also Charles, the young son of Sir Guilbert. Eager was the lad\nand highly pleased to go forth with the brave knight.\n\nSir Galahad had had hopes of meeting Sir Launcelot who had planned to\nbe in Normandy, and Merlin as well. But he would wait no longer, he\nwas in no mood to tarry now.\n\nThere came a day of storm, fierce was the rain and sleet and the wind\nso strong that the knight, and his party found it arduous task to keep\nthe road. Sir Galahad decided to stop and seek shelter at the first\nrefuge that they should find.\n\nA little later they came to an old but magnificent castle and in\nanswer to the summons of Walker, an ancient man appeared.\n\n\"What will you?\" the old man quavered.\n\n\"My master seeks shelter until the storm passes. He is a worshipful\nknight. Go you to your master with his request.\"\n\nThe man hobbled within the castle. Soon he returned.\n\n\"There is no master here but my mistress bids me welcome the\nworshipful knight and beseech his entrance.\"\n\nSo they went within and the old man threw logs on the open fire which\nblazed right merrily. Sir Galahad and the two with him made themselves\ncomfortable. Soon food and drink was brought to them of which they\npartook with good grace.\n\nThe storm did not subside and night came on.\n\n\"Old man,\" Sir Galahad said to the ancient servitor. \"Pay you my\nrespects to the lady whose hospitality we enjoy and ask that she grace\nus with her presence. Tell her that it is Sir Galahad, Knight of the\nRound Table, who seeks it.\"\n\nThere came a long wait which left the three a wondering. Then there\ncame forth a lady who was followed by the ancient servitor. Stately\nshe was and of noble bearing. Yet it could be seen that she was\nfearful and disturbed.\n\n\"My lord wished my presence?\" she asked and her tone was tremulous.\n\n\"I owe you apology for this disturbance,\" the knight said courteously.\n\"But we also owe you thanks for your gracious hospitality. There seems\nneed that we disturb you further since the storm stays and we cannot\nproceed as we would. May we find lodging within your walls?\"\n\nThe lady looked fearfully about.\n\n\"I cannot deny you. Truly it is no night to be outdoors. Stay then\nand welcome.\"\n\nMorning found the storm in no wise abated. The lady of the castle did\nnot appear at the morning meal. But the old man was there to serve\nthem. He too, seemed much disturbed and made as if to have speech with\nSir Galahad, once or twice.\n\n\"What troubles your pate, old man?\" Walker finally asked him.\n\n\"These are dark days for the house of Sanscourt,\" the latter replied\nand crossed himself.\n\n\"Perhaps, good man, it may be within us to lighten them,\" Sir Galahad\nsaid kindly, \"If we can, it may repay in part for your mistress'\nhospitality.\"\n\n\"Would that my lady could find it in her to confide in you. For you\nseem right friendly, my lord.\"\n\n\"Beseech you her. Tell her that Sir Galahad offers his services if she\nhas need of them.\"\n\nThe man soon returned.\n\n\"My lady thanks you kindly for your offer and she will see you soon,\"\nhe said.\n\nThe Knight waited but a few moments when his hostess came into the\nroom.\n\n\"You are gracious, Sir Galahad. I doubt whether there can be any help\nfor me. Yet I shall tell you my story for there still may be hope for\nso wretched a person as myself.\"\n\n\"My lady, it is the duty of all true knights to be of help to those in\ndistress. Wherefore, I hold but to my knightly vow, in my promise of\nservice to you.\"\n\nThe Lady Jeanne made no answer, seemingly she had not heard him. Sir\nGalahad watched her, saw her look which seemed afar, saw the dark rims\naround her eyes. They spoke of many hours of weeping.\n\nNow she turned to him.\n\n\"I think, my lord, this storm that seems as if it will not cease has\nbeen sent by God. Strange though it may seem it brings me hope, dim\nthough that hope may be, yet I treasure it. Little reason for hope\nhave I had.\n\n\"Think me not rude, Sir Galahad, and think not that I question your\nvalor or skill. But this is task for no lone knight, for my enemy is\nstrong and powerful. I may be selfish too, in that I draw you into my\ntroubles but I am like one who drowning, must need snatch at a straw.\nAnd many knights would hesitate long to offer service where the cause\nis as hopeless as mine seemingly is. Nor will I blame you or hold you,\nif after my story is done, you find no way in which you can help me.\n\n\"Listen then and you will see why I count this storm as sign of hope\nsent to me.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SIX\n\nLady Jeanne's Story\n\n\nTwo years will it be next month when the Duke of Gascony with fifty\nknights went forth on a quest that would take them to far Eastern\nlands. Of these fifty, Sir Vilard, my husband, was one.\n\n\"He left with me, my son Ambrose, my daughter Helene and two\nservitors, old men who could not go with him. It was in a good and\nholy cause so I had no tears for him to see. Rather did I bid him\nGodspeed and a safe and quick return.\n\n\"You see me alone now. Two years, and I have neither son, nor\ndaughter, nor husband. Did I know they were dead, bitter would be my\nwoe yet would I count God's mercies many, His ways strange, but not\nfor any mortal to question. But I do not know that. They would have me\nbelieve my husband dead. Ambrose went forth one day and I have had no\nword of him since then. And my daughter is lodged within prison walls\nwaiting the whim of Sir Dolphus who holds her in his power.\n\n\"They tell me that my husband perished with the Duke and all but three\nof the knights that went forth with him. And that before he died he\nsent word that it was his wish that I permit Sir Dolphus to marry our\ndaughter. Yet do I know that Sir Dolphus is already lawfully wedded to\na wife whom he would discard. Knowing my husband as I do, I could not\nbelieve such to be his message. So I withstood the pleadings of this\nknight until his pleadings turned to bitter threats.\n\n\"He would make himself Duke of Gascony. And when I would not listen to\nhim, his pleadings or threats, he came here one day with two other\nknights and professed to abide by such decision as I had made. They\ndined with us. Ambrose, my son, was away that day.\n\n\"Enough to say that they stole my daughter from me. This old man you\nsee and the other, Albert, were clubbed to earth, the one to death. I\ntried so hard to resist them but my hand was weak.\n\n\"When Ambrose returned, I could not keep him. He went forth to rescue\nhis sister. Poor lad, I have had no word from him since then. Is he\ndead? Did they kill him? I have sent for word, have begged that they\ntell me what fate has befallen him but they profess not to know.\n\n\"I have heard that the Church will not sanction his marriage to\nHelene. Nor will it permit Sir Dolphus to annul the marriage with his\nwife. A good priest also tells me that Sir Dolphus has set his black\nheart upon marrying my poor Helene so that he can then lawfully own\nall this land and estate that belongs to us. It will be small matter\nto rid himself of me and I fain would not wish to live were it not\nthat I still have hope.\n\n\"My lord, I have hoped so much. Until my very hope turned black for\nnever was there any one so helpless against the power of this wicked\nman. I dread the coming of each day and yet mixed with my dread there\nstill is ever present that one small hope which will not be killed.\n\n\"I think I would have died but for this small hope,\" she added\nwistfully. She paused now and seemed lost in the dark thoughts that\npossessed her.\n\n\"All of them gone. Not one of them to remain with me.\"\n\n\"Sir Galahad,\" she turned to him. \"It is not a pretty story. I seem to\nbe encompassed with tragedy. I would not include you in my woes, you\nhave other missions, other work ahead. And though you have the valor\nand strength of ten, it would count for so little.\"\n\n\"My lady,\" the knight replied. \"What use would such valor be, if I had\nit, if I did not but use it for its full worth? Could I be a true\nknight and not heed the call your sorrow brings? I can but try to help\nyou. And that, I swear, I will.\"\n\nA light shone in the lady's eye. \"I was not wrong to hope. Even now I\nfeel that succor must come. Your words, dear knight, give me strength.\nSurely then, the storm has brought me some ray of that hope I speak\nof.\"\n\n\"I shall devise some plan,\" Sir Galahad said, \"wherein we can make\nrescue of your daughter, and find out the fate of your son.\"\n\nThe Knight's thoughts were deep for many minutes. \"Did this Sir\nDolphus say where your husband met his death?\"\n\n\"Near Lombardy,\" she replied.\n\n\"If I succeed here, my lady, I shall continue my way to Rome. From\nthere I shall journey north and seek news of your husband. It may be\nthat he is not dead. Dead or alive, you at least will know.\n\n\"Tomorrow, if the day clears, we shall turn to the work before us. It\nseems a hard task but as I have said, we can but try. In the meantime,\nmy Lady Jeanne, have courage and keep your patience.\"\n\nSo Galahad left her. But Walker stayed.\n\n\"Lady, I would but add my humble word of cheer. In all of England, of\nall the Knights of the Round Table, there is none who equals my master\nin skill and bravery. I tell you this so that you may know how worthy\nyour champion is. Would that he had but one other with him and I\nwould not care what odds were against him.\"\n\n\"And who, my man, is that other?\"\n\n\"Sir Launcelot,\" Walker made reply.\n\n\"I thank you for telling me of Sir Galahad. It adds to the hope I have\nand the courage he bids me possess.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN\n\nSir Launcelot Arrives\n\n\nThe day dawned bright and clear. But it brought to Sir Galahad no plan\nfor the rescue of the daughter of his hostess.\n\nMy lady came down to the breakfast table greatly cheered, as was plain\nto be seen. Sir Galahad had not the heart to tell her that as yet he\nhad found no way for the rescue of her daughter. Instead he said.\n\n\"It seems to me that there is one thing I can but do. I shall seek\nthis knight's castle and wait for such event there as may befall. Luck\nmay come my way. But I promise you this, my lady, I shall make no rash\nor fruitless attempt at rescue. Rash acts may well come after the\nrescue of your daughter, not before.\"\n\nThe Lady Jeanne agreed. So then immediately after the meal Walker, and\nthe page Charles prepared the things they would need for the journey.\n\n\"I go forth to prepare the horses, young master. Will you see to these\nthings here?\" So spoke Walker and when Charles agreed he hurried\noutdoors.\n\n[Illustration: Suddenly They Made For Each Other]\n\nHardly had he reached there, however, when he saw two horsemen coming\ntoward him. His trained eye easily recognized them. One could be no\nother than Sir Launcelot. Only he sat his horse so. And the rider with\nhim was Gouvernail, he who had been squire to Sir Tristram until that\nbrave knight had died and who now was in the service of Sir Launcelot.\n\n\"By my faith,\" spoke out Walker to the empty air. He rubbed his eyes.\nYes, it was they.\n\n\"A wish come true,\" was all he could think of. And then he danced\nfirst on one foot, then on the other, uncertain whether to rush to\nmeet the advancing horsemen or to run inside and advise his master.\nHis uncertainty ended only when he was indoors again.\n\n\"Master, master, come you here,\" he called. \"See who comes,\" he\nshouted gleefully.\n\nSir Galahad came toward him. But not as quick as the eager, youthful\nCharles. After them all, came the Lady Jeanne.\n\n\"It is Launcelot, by my faith,\" Sir Galahad shouted gleefully. \"He was\nto meet me in Normandy and has followed close on my heels. What luck!\"\nAnd he waved to the approaching knight who returned the salute and\nincreased his speed.\n\nThe Lady Jeanne turned questioning eyes to the squire, who nodded\nhappily.\n\n\"My lady,\" Sir Galahad turned to her. \"Now you may well have hope and\nfaith. And well may you give us your blessing for we shall bring your\ndaughter to you, have no fear.\"\n\nSo spoke the knight whose faith in Sir Launcelot's prowess was most\nprofound.\n\nNow the approaching knight came up to them.\n\n\"Good Allan,\" he said still calling his friend by the name of his\nboyhood. \"I have traveled through a day of storm to catch up with you.\nUntil I am sure that this knave here is prepared to seek a master who\nwould be saner and more considerate.\"\n\n\"Not so,\" replied Gouvernail, \"for I was no less the anxious.\"\n\n\"You come in good time, dear friend. For never were you more needed.\nThere is work ahead for us, serious work. This lady here needs our\nhelp. She is sore distressed. But let her meet you.\"\n\nSo the Lady Jeanne met Sir Launcelot. And once again the tale of her\nplight was revealed. And even as Sir Launcelot listened, the plan of\nwhat to do came to Sir Galahad. But he kept his tongue until his\nfriend was fully informed and had in turn had time to question their\nhostess.\n\nCharles stood close to his master, whose arm encircled him as if it\nwould include him in all of it. A little in the background stood the\ntwo squires who were close friends and old comrades. Gouvernail's\ninterest was keen.\n\nSo when the tale was done, Sir Galahad turned to his friend and said\n\"Know you perchance where Merlin is?\"\n\n\"We left him behind us. His old bones could not risk yesterday's\nstorm. But he promised me that he would follow when it cleared and so\nhe is but a day behind. But have you a plan, Allan?\"\n\n\"It has but just come to me--this possible plan. It may be that he can\nbe emissary from Arthur to the Duke of Gascony for such purpose as may\nbe devised. And we go with him as knights. We _know not_, of\ncourse, that a pretender sits where the Duke of Gascony should. And I\nfancy that this Dolphus will be right well pleased to welcome us and\nif we seemingly appear not too scrupulous ourselves we can worm the\nstory from him and act thereon.\"\n\n\"It can be done, if the plan is well thought out. Only dear lad, I\ndoubt whether thy face will not count against you in any pretended\nvillainy. Think you not so, madame?\"\n\nThe Lady Jeanne smiled. It was strange to see her smile but it gave\nproof that she was lighter hearted.\n\n\"I think that Sir Dolphus is not the kind to think that there are any\nwho hold aught but villianous thoughts,\" she replied.\n\n\"So then, we must need delay until Merlin comes.\"\n\n\"Think you the king will be provoked at our use of him and his court?\"\nSir Galahad asked.\n\n\"Aye, that I do. Provoked that he was not with us to share in the\nadventure.\" Launcelot laughingly replied.\n\n\"Lady,\" Sir Launcelot addressed her in a moment's pause. \"You had\nlittle need to worry when this knight became your champion. He is\noverly modest. Gladly shall I help him.\"\n\n\"God is good,\" the Lady Jeanne replied brokenly. \"And He has placed me\nand my troubles in godly hands.\" And then she wept. And it seemed as\nif like a spring freshet, her thoughts, soul, and heart, were cleared\nand cleansed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT\n\nA Rescue\n\n\n\"I seek speech with him who is Duke of Gascony. I bring him a message\nfrom Arthur, King of England.\" So spoke Merlin as he stood at the\nentrance of the great and splendid castle of the ruler of Gascony.\n\nBy his side were the two knights, Galahad and Launcelot. The page\nCharles stood close by and somewhat behind them were the two squires,\nWalker and Gouvernail.\n\n\"From England's king?\" the Gascon knight questioned. And made as if\nhe would further satisfy his curiosity. But changed his mind.\n\n\"I pray you wait, good sir, until I tell my lord, your message.\" So\nthen he went within the great hall.\n\n\"A rash adventure, say I,\" and Merlin shook his head dolefully.\n\n\"You were ever a croaker, good Merlin,\" replied Sir Launcelot. \"See\nnot the thing so dolefully, I pray you.\"\n\n\"And think of the worth of what we accomplish,\" added Sir Galahad.\n\"Here now comes the Gascon with his answer, I see. Let us listen to\nwhat he says.\"\n\n\"We bid you welcome to Gascony and pray you to come within. My master\nsends his greetings and awaits you.\"\n\nThey followed then their guide and so came within the great hall of\nstate where Sir Dolphus awaited them.\n\n\"Come you from England?\" he asked.\n\n\"That we do,\" replied Merlin, \"and carry a message for the Duke.\"\n\n\"There is no Duke of Gascony. He is dead. But I, by the will of all\nthe nobles of the land, rule in place. If you have message from\nEngland's king honor is mine to receive it.\"\n\n\"That message will I deliver right gladly. My king has long desired to\ncome to Gascony and to other countries in France. So has he sent me\nforth to find first, how welcome will his visit be, second, as you may\nwell understand, that such country as may come within his plans may\nworthy be his presence. For England's king must hold his honor and\nhis presence at their royal worth.\n\n\"So come I to this brave land the which my king has heard well spoken\nand which he holds in high esteem. I find it sad news that he who\nreigned is dead, yet Gascony cannot suffer if you, most worshipful\nsir, rule instead.\"\n\nNow did the crafty Dolphus find himself quick to see the worth to him\nof such a visit from the great king of England who was held in high\nesteem everywhere. If Arthur were to visit him then could none\nquestion his pretense to the throne. Too, were such visit soon, there\nwould be need for him to be declared Duke of Gascony at once, so that\nArthur could be met in royal state.\n\n\"Gascony, good sir, would welcome your king. And count it honor to\nreceive him with all the honors due so great a name. When does your\nmaster plan to come?\"\n\n\"Shortly, sir, after I make my return to England and make report. For\nhe hopes also to visit Rome and pay homage to His Holiness, the Pope.\"\n\nWhen he heard this, Sir Dolphus urged the emissaries of England's king\nto tarry awhile in Gascony.\n\n\"So that, kind sirs, you find our friendship for your master, such as\nmay befit his visit to us. Greatly do we desire him to come and we\nwould wish your report to be a kindly one. So find you welcome here.\nWe shall eat, drink and be merry.\"\n\nSo the party made itself at home. Sir Dolphus soon took great fancy to\nSir Launcelot who proved a merry soul and the two spent many hours\ntogether.\n\n\"I would count it fortunate, Sir Launcelot, were you knight of this\ncourt. For I need friends such as you.\"\n\n\"Rather, I fancy, is the need otherwise. For the Duke of Gascony's\nfriendship is no small thing and many there are who would hold it high\nhonor. Of friends, you should have many.\" So the knight made\nflattering answer.\n\n\"Aye, but you know not. There are those who would believe that the\ndead duke lives and who though silent, yet are sullen over my rightful\nclaim to take his place. And I find the Church of little help to me.\nThough I have offered it many gifts, and promised it great riches, yet\nwill it oppose my will.\"\n\n\"Does the Church object to you as Duke?\" Sir Launcelot questioned. \"I\nsee not why.\"\n\n\"Nay, 'tis not as Duke but in other matters.\"\n\nCaution seemed to overcome Sir Dolphus for many minutes. But he had\ngreat desire to confide in this friendly knight whose good will he\nwished.\n\n\"Art thou married, Sir Launcelot?\" he asked.\n\n\"A strange question, my friend. Yet do I find my happiness in the\nsingle blessedness which is at present mine.\"\n\n\"Yet is marriage a most convenient thing sometime. 'Twould be for me\nat present.\"\n\n\"Say you, _'twould be?_ Yet, if I mistake not, have I heard that\nthat blessed state is already yours. Though no sign have I seen as\nyet, of the Lady Dolphus.\n\n\"Aye, friend, married am I, worse the pity. And when I ask the Church\nto annul this unhappy state, and give it many gifts, still does it\nturn stubborn over such a little thing.\"\n\n\"What harm therein, my friend? Since that the lady is not with you?\"\nFriendly was Sir Launcelot's tone and right sympathetic.\n\n\"Aye, there I come back to what I have said--about marriage being most\nconvenient at times. For would they annul the marriage I could then\nmarry again, one who owns vast estate. And that would make me all\npowerful in Gascony.\"\n\nSuch laughter as shook the frame of Sir Launcelot. Nor was it\nunkindly.\n\n\"A great rogue you,\" he spoke pleasantly. \"Off with the old and on\nwith the new. Is it not so? And I fancy the new is also right young or\nI am greatly mistaken? Eh?\"\n\nGreat was Sir Launcelot's hilarity. Nor did the other take offense\nthereat.\n\n\"I care little as to her youth or not. But I do care for the estate\nthat goes with her,\" replied Sir Dolphus.\n\n\"She must like you greatly, to be willing?\"\n\n\"Hardly could I say, she's that. But that would be small matter if I\ncould but get the Church to sanction the deed. Yet have I hope that\nif I could get your king's goodwill, he could persuade the Pope on his\nvisit to Rome. And there, good friend, you could help me greatly and\nwell would I repay such kindness.\"\n\nNot once did Sir Launcelot permit the hot temper within him to be\nunloosed. Played he so well with the wicked knight that it was but a\nfew days thereafter Sir Dolphus invited him to visit with him the\nyoung damsel who was kept within prison walls. Never once did the\nknight demur or permit the other to think that he did not sympathize\nand agree with his plans.\n\nAs they walked away from the prison door, he turned to the other.\n\"Strange that she should be all alone. Has she no one who would make\nyou trouble?\"\n\n\"Her father went forth with the Duke and others among us to the land\nof the infidels. On our way back, in Lombardy, our small force was\novercome by disaster. But three of us escaped, I know not what\nhappened to the others. Then it was, I decided to possess the land of\nthe Sanscourt and told the Lady Jeanne that her husband wished and\ncommanded that her daughter Helene marry me. But she would have none\nof this. So that I had to steal the damsel. And when her brother came\nhere to rescue her, we overcame the helpless youth. He would not have\nlived had I my way, but the others would not permit that and so we\nhave him safely lodged in the dungeon below and I fancy he will not\nabuse our hospitality for long.\"\n\nThat night Sir Launcelot spoke to the others and told what he had\nheard. Great was his rage, which he had curbed so well when in the\npresence of the other.\n\n\"I would,\" Merlin spoke in great gloom, \"that we were well out of\nthis.\"\n\n\"We can be well out of it when the youth and girl are also safely\nout,\" Sir Galahad replied and there was a stern look in his eye.\n\"Tomorrow we shall find the dungeon place. Then will we act quickly.\nBut also we must see to it that this false knight receives his just\ndeserts. Is it not so, Launcelot?\"\n\n\"Tomorrow, it shall be,\" the other replied. \"And I myself, shall deal\nwith this Sir Dolphus, for I have had to listen to his foulness\nwithout demur.\"\n\nSo they planned. And the next day, Sir Galahad professed a great\ndesire to see the whole of the castle. And so was shown in due course\nthe great dungeon and saw there, the weak and spent lad, Ambrose.\n\nThat night, Sir Dolphus and Sir Launcelot went by themselves to the\nchamber of the former to make merry. And there, Sir Dolphus who\ncounted the other's sympathy as beyond doubt, told more of his knavish\nplots. Until the listener sick with listening turned to him in the\nquiet and secrecy of the great chamber and said in stern tones.\n\n\"Sir Dolphus, I would advise you to pray now. For you die in three\nminutes!\"\n\nNor did the other mistake the voice, the tone. Nor even make pretense\nto misunderstand. Instead he made as if to raise a great shout. But\nfound the other's mighty hand closed over his foul mouth so that his\ncall for aid was unuttered. And the hand remained there--even as the\nowner forced him to his knees with no great effort.\n\n\"Pray, if you will. Your time is almost gone.\"\n\nBut the wretch groaned and squirmed and tried to escape the hold that\nheld viselike over him.\n\nIt was five minutes later that Sir Launcelot left the room. There was\na grim, fixed look on his face that few had ever seen before.\n\nHe joined the others. And then while [he] and Gouvernail went to the\nprison chamber of the damsel, Helene, and rescued her with little\neffort, Sir Galahad went down to the dungeon door and there overcame\nthe guard with ease and opened the door wide with the keys obtained.\nAnd Walker carried the weak lad to the entrance door and so they\njoined the others.\n\nSo then Sir Galahad and Sir Launcelot with the two squires went for\nand obtained their horses, without suspicion. With the two they had\nrescued, the whole party rode forth from the castle. And but for the\noutcry of the guards at the gate which they forced them to open wide,\nthey had no one to cope with.\n\nForth they road swiftly, Merlin carrying the young girl and Charles\nsupporting the boy, leaving the others free to ride behind and meet\nsuch pursuers as might come.\n\nBut none pursued.\n\n\"I think they will find a task on hand to care for the other prisoners\nthe open dungeon door unloosed,\" Sir Galahad said.\n\n\"And with the wonder over Sir Dolphus,\" Sir Launcelot added and his\nlook was far away.\n\nA day later found them at the castle of Sanscourt. Happy was my Lady\nJeanne over the return of her dear children and grateful, too. It did\nnot take long for them to prepare to go forth to England with Sir\nLauncelot and Merlin.\n\nSo they bade each the other goodbye. And as they went forth, Sir\nGalahad watching them go, said to the Lady Jeanne,\n\n\"Still hope, my lady. For I shall bring or send you word of Sir\nVilard, good or bad.\"\n\n\"I shall never cease to hope, Sir Galahad. And I shall pray for you,\neach day until you return.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-NINE\n\nFacing the East\n\n\nSo then the trio turned toward the East seeking but never finding that\nall elusive Grail which seemed ever ahead of them. Strange lands they\npassed through and it left them with wonderment at the bigness of the\nworld in which they lived.\n\nFor Sir Galahad and for the boy Charles, each day brought the wonder\nof new things to see. For Walker, the Squire, though he would not make\nconfession to his master, there grew the wish to see again the\npleasant green of England's shore. None of the wonders of these\nstrange lands held allure for him, since they but proved England's\ngreater worth.\n\nBut when twitted by his master he would make no confession of his\nhome-sickness.\n\n\"Nay master. I am a man and would hold it weak whimsy to let yearning\nfor my home land encompass me. I go where you will and soon enough\nwill I make return to our home shores.\"\n\nAnd the Grail, Symbol of Honor, of Faith, of Service and of Piety! No\nnearer to the finding did the young knight appear to be. Even so, the\nzest for it, the need for finding it stayed ever with him.\n\nSo he reached Rome and stayed in it for many days. Many strangers\nwere there from many lands but few who knew of the Holy Grail. And\nnone who could tell him where it could be found.\n\n\"I would seek, were I you, in the Holy Land,\" said one pious man.\nWhile still another thought so holy a thing would never be permitted\nto go so far as England and that the knight's search was fruitless.\n\nFrom Rome Sir Galahad went north to Lombardy in search of news of Sir\nVilard. Long was his search here but not hopeless. Nor need we make\nrecord of how at last he found that the Gascon was not dead but\nimprisoned with some of the other knights of that ill fated group. And\nwhen ransom was agreed to he returned to Rome and sent a message to\nSir Launcelot by a friendly English knight to find the Lady Jeanne and\nhave sent to him the ransom desired.\n\nMonths passed. Then came Ambrose and with him the gold for the freedom\nof his father and his companions. So that they were free. Only then\ndid Sir Galahad go on.\n\nHe reached the Holy Land in company with others, men who came there to\npay reverence, men who came to repent of many sins, men who ever\nrestless must journey everywhere. And on the way he had gained the\nfriendship of an old priest whose journey he had made somewhat the\nlighter by such help as youth may offer old age.\n\nThe priest had been greatly interested in the mission of the knight.\nMany were his questions, of where Sir Galahad had traveled, how far he\npurposed to journey in his search.\n\n\"My journeys shall not cease, good father, until I have found the\nGrail. For so have I set my whole life that I may find it. And time\ncounts not. Though I wish it could be found right soon for then may I\nturn my face to England.\" Since Sir Galahad had spoken of Yosalinde,\nthe priest understood.\n\n\"What then, Sir Knight, makes you think you will find the Grail in far\nlands?\" the priest asked.\n\n\"It must need be so, since were it nearer home it would have been\nfound long since.\"\n\nTo which the priest made no answer.\n\nDays later, when they were gathered about again he told the story of\nElam, the son of Anner, who had a great desire to gain wisdom and\nknowledge.\n\n\"So then, young friends, he started out to learn from all the founts\nof wisdom. Far he traveled and much he learned.\"\n\nAnd then the reverend man gave long account of the places to which\nElam had gone and the things he had learned. It was a tale of many\nyears and it took time in the telling.\n\n\"Then when he had learned much of the wisdom of the then world and had\ngained in knowledge, he returned home. And when he was there but a few\ndays, lo, he found that yet had his father Anner, greater knowledge\nthan he and wisdom more profound. And he knew this now, returned home\nfrom all his sojournings. Nor would he have known this unless he had\ntraveled far, for my sons, it was in this way that he gained the\nvision to see. Of a truth, it was then that he knew that his father\nwas wisest of men and well could he learn from him.\"\n\n\"I have not heard of this man Elam, before,\" Sir Galahad said. \"Yet\nhad he great need to travel, if he gained this vision to see.\"\n\n\"True and well spoken, Sir Knight,\" replied the priest and watched him\nkeenly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY\n\nHomeward\n\n\nStill further did Sir Galahad have a mind to travel but he found from\nlearned men that to go further East was to travel into uncertainties\nwhich few had ventured before him. Nor would he have paused even\nthen, were it not that he realized well that little likelihood was\nthere for the Lost Grail to be found in the far East.\n\nSo he turned his face west again. Slowly he made his way home. There\nwere days now, he misdoubted the success of his search and he\nquestioned his own worthiness.\n\nAfter months and months of travel he reached France once again. When\nhe came to Gascony he found the rightful ruler on the throne and the\nhouse of Sanscourt, well and happy. Great was the welcome given the\nknight by the happy family and a great feast was held for them. The\nLady Jeanne was radiant with the happiness which had returned after\nseeming desertion.\n\n\"We owe you much, Sir Galahad,\" said Sir Vilard, \"so very much that it\nis beyond repayment.\"\n\n\"Mine and Sir Launcelot's was the joy of service, my lord. That you\nmust well understand.\"\n\nWhen they reached Normandy, Charles was given a happy reception. He\nhad grown, and had profited well by his travels and service to Sir\nGalahad whom he would not leave now. For he hoped to be made a knight\nby him. In Normandy, Sir Galahad stayed for more than a month. He had\nacquired great fame because of his travels and deeds yet did he find\nsmall pleasure in this for the great purpose of his journeys had\nfailed.\n\nIt was on a day just before he was to return to England. He had\nmounted the Seeker and without companion had gone forth for the\nmorning. His thoughts were of the Grail, of his great wish to find it,\nand ever with his thoughts the wish to prove to Yosalinde that it was\nin him to find it. Well he knew that she would understand his desire\neven though he could not bring to her the fulfillment of that desire.\n\n\"Yet who am I to find myself disheartened. I must not question, keep\never seeking.\" So he thought to himself and gave no heed to where the\nSeeker carried him.\n\nNor did it seem strange to the knight that he found himself in a\nnarrow path of the woods and before him the strange monk who had first\ngiven him urge to seek the Holy Grail.\n\n\"I greet you, holy father. Nor can I say to you that I have yet proven\nworthy of the finding of that which I have long sought.\"\n\n\"Yet have you traveled far, my son. Is it not so?\"\n\n\"Far and to many lands, holy sir. But nowhere have I found that which\nbrought me nearer to it.\"\n\n\"Too, I know how worthy of the finding you are. Well have you kept\nyour purpose high, knightly have your deeds been?\"\n\n\"Holy father, I have but tried. Ever have I kept your words before me.\nAnd deem it all worth the while, even though it end with my not\nfinding the Grail. For, father, this will I always say, that joy has\nthere been in the seeking.\"\n\n\"Think you then, my son, you will not find it?\" the monk asked.\n\n\"I know not, father. Think me not grown tired of the search. Think not\nthat I complain that the search is long or arduous. I shall go on\nseeking where the call may lead me. And ever seek to be worthy of\nfinding it. He who decides all things shall decide as to that. Nor\nwill He find me ever questioning. For this I have found. God is good\nand His ways are ever for the best.\"\n\n\"Glad am I to hear that the search goes on. My blessing goes with you.\nWell have I kept the count of all the days of your journeyings and\ngreat is my pride in you. So son, seek on for who can tell what the\nmorrow brings.\"\n\nThen the holy man left him. Yet Sir Galahad did not go until long\nafter sundown. And when he did, doubled was the strength of his\npurpose.\n\nAnd on the morrow he was on his way to England.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-ONE\n\nThe Beggar And The Grail\n\n\nEngland to Charles, was indeed strange but so much had Walker spoken\nthereof that he looked forward to seeing it as if it were his native\nland. The joy of Walker at its nearness, though he tried to hide it\nunder pretended calm was yet a thing quite obvious to Sir Galahad and\nthe boy and much did it amuse them.\n\n\"Of all the fair lands we have passed through, have you yet found none\nthat pleased you more, good Walker?\" the knight asked him.\n\n\"There is but one heaven, my master and there is but one England,\"\nreplied Walker.\n\n\"Then must I confess my sorrow at keeping you this long time from\nheaven,\" said his master with mock regret.\n\n\"Nay, master, one can only know heaven when one has seen all the other\nplaces. Too, I care not even for England when my master is not there.\"\n\n\"Kind words, good Walker. And spoke I ten times as kindly, yet could I\nnot do justice to how much you have counted and how well. Will I say\nthis, that I find it sweet to know that we are so near to England's\nshores and that it is but a few days when we shall again find\nourselves at home. I would see all our friends, the good king, Sir\nPercival, Sir Gareth, Sir Launcelot and the others. This wind that\nfills these sails cannot blow too strong for me.\"\n\nWell did the wind hold yet did it seem as if the next days were over\nlong. At last they were but a half day from the great castle of King\nArthur.\n\nNow as they rode, adventure there had been none since they had left\nNormandy, they were stopped by a strange beggar who sought alms. Sick\ndid he seem, ragged and wretched, and as if life could hold but little\nfor him. It was the selfsame beggar they had passed when they started\non their journey.\n\n\"Good master, I starve. Charity I seek.\"\n\nNow though, Sir Galahad was impatient to reach the castle, yet did he\nstop for the poor wretch drew his pity.\n\n\"What will you, my man?\"\n\n\"Food, if you have it, Sir Knight. Such help as you can give so low a\nthing as me.\"\n\nSo then without further ado, he bade Walker feed the knave, which the\nlatter did, grumbling at the delay the same must cause. Then, the\nknight spoke kindly again to the beggar and gave him some silver.\n\n\"Master,\" the beggar said. \"The Lord will bless you, for you found\ntime for so wretched a soul as me. Far have you traveled, many of high\ndegree have found it honor to hold speech with you. So great a knight\nas you and yet have you had time for the beggar on the road.\n\n\"Honor have you shown, Faith have you ever had. Service have you\nrendered. This day you prove that you have Piety and Charity. So then\nfor your food and for your silver and your kind words and the spirit\nbehind it all, I pay you now. Here, then is the Grail. Long sought in\nmany lands, in many places, yet was it always near at home.\"\n\n\"The Grail? Here, where I never thought to see it. And a beggar to\npossess it. Aye, even the lowliest possesses riches.\"\n\nMixed were the knight's emotions nor could he voice the thoughts and\nthe feelings within him. While nearby the two with him watched it all\nin awed silence.\n\n\"Aye, Sir Galahad. Think not that your search in far lands was\nfruitless. Rather was it the caldron in which your worth was seasoned.\nYet will this fact ever remain--that one need not travel far to find\nHonor, Faith, Service and Piety. For these are ever near.\"\n\n\"I am like Elam who went everywhere and found that what he sought was\nnear at home.\"\n\n\"True, good knight. This day shall be a great day for England, for\nthrough the worth of one of its knights, the Grail stays here. Go you\nthen, for word will already be at the Round Table that Sir Galahad\ncomes with the Grail.\"\n\n\"Strange man, I know not what to say. Dear is the possession of this\nprecious vessel to me. Long have I sought it. And to find it to have\nbeen so near at home stirs mixed and wondrous feelings within me. So I\ncan but go and if I fail to say the thing I should, forgive me.\"\n\nThe knight, Charles and Walker as well, found themselves kneeling to\nreceive the benediction of this strange man who was both beggar and\nholy man. And when they looked up again he was gone.\n\n\"Thought I,\" said Walker, \"that that day, my master found this Grail\nthere would be great doings, that there would be great combats.\nInstead of which a seeming beggar has it to give us. Verily, it is far\nbeyond me.\"\n\nAnd the good squire scratched his head in great puzzlement.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-TWO\n\nConclusion\n\n\nWe find our story now near ended. We can well see the great welcome\ngiven the still youthful knight as he entered the great hall. There\nwas King Arthur in high good humor. About him stood many of the\nknights of the Round Table, and among them Sir Galahad saw his many\nfriends. And as the young knight stood there there came to him the\nmemory of that first day and the wondrous hope he had had now come\ntrue.\n\nIn all the hall none was so happy as that brave and noble hearted\nknight, Sir Launcelot. Well pleased he was. Merlin was there, also\nwell content. And there, when they sat down to the great feast spread\nout for them, Sir Galahad told the story of his search or the Grail. A\nlong tale it was for they would hear it all. To it they listened in\nsilence, without interruption, until he had done.\n\nThough he showed it not, the young knight was eager to be free of all\nthese friends. For he had great desire to hasten to the home of Sir\nPercival. He knew from what Sir Percival told him, Yosalinde would he\nthere. Yet could he not leave until the late afternoon.\n\nSwiftly did the Seeker take him there. Eagerly he sought the sight of\nthe castle as if in seeing that, he would also see this damsel who had\nhelped so much to give him the great purpose of his search. But it was\nnot until he had entered within, that he saw her.\n\nSo we draw the curtain and leave you to suppose the joy and the\ngladness of this welcome. And though to each the finding of the Holy\nGrail was of high importance yet they spoke not of that but of other\nthings for many an hour until the sun had gone down and darkness had\ncome.\n\nWonderful was the picture Sir Galahad had carried of his lady, yet he\nfound the real presence far dearer. Of the things they talked, one was\nthe future and what it meant to both of them.\n\nWe leave them then. High the moon shines, the stars are everywhere. It\nis a wonderful night, soft the gentle breeze. Such a night as each\nhad pictured for their first meeting.\n\nCharles, the Norman lad, had his wish come true in good time, when Sir\nGalahad made him a knight. Then the new knight made his way back to\nNormandy. It was his children's children who made their way in later\ndays to England and settled there.\n\nThe deeds of the brave knights of the Round Table continued great and\nglorious. Sir Galahad, Sir Launcelot, Sir Percival and the others\nupheld the honor of King Arthur's court. And never did Sir Galahad\nlower the banner of his great house.\n\nHonor, Faith, Service and Piety.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's In the Court of King Arthur, by Samuel Lowe\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK IN THE COURT OF KING ARTHUR ***\n\n***** This file should be named 6582.txt or 6582.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/6/5/8/6582/\n\nProduced by Alan Millar and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
