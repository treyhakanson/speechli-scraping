The one-act play in particular,\nchiefly represented in this volume, appears to be taking the\nplace of that rather squeezed sponge, the short story, in the\nfavor of the reading public. Of course, this tendency has its\nreaction in schoolrooms. One even hears of high-school classes\nwhich attempt to keep up with the entire output of such dramas in\nEnglish readings. If this is not merely an apologue, it is\ncertainly a horrible example. The bulk of current drama, as of\npublished matter generally, is not worthy the time of the English\nclass. Only what is measurably of rank, in truth and fineness,\nwith the literature which has endured from past times can be\ndefended for use there. And we have too much that is both well\nfitted to young people's keen interest and enjoyment, and\nbeautifully worthy as well, for time to be wasted upon the third-\nand fourth-rate.\n\nObviously, much of the best in modern play-writing has not been\nincluded in this volume. Because of copyright complications the\nworks of Mr. Masefield, Mr. Shaw, Mr. Drinkwater, and Sir James\nBarrie are not here represented. The plays by these writers that\nseem best fitted to use by teachers and pupils in high schools,\ntogether with a large number of other dramas for this purpose,\nare listed and annotated at the back of the book. Suggestions as\nto desirable inclusions and omissions will be welcomed by the\neditor and the publishers.\n\nFollowing in their own way the lead of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Libre in Paris\nand the Freie B\u00fchne in Germany, and of the Independent and the\nRepertory theatres in Great Britain, numerous \"little theatres\"\nand drama associations in this country are giving impulsion and\ndirection to the movement for finer drama and more excellent\npresentation. The Harvard dramatic societies, the Morningside\nPlayers at Columbia, Mr. Alex Drummond's Community Theatre at the\nState Fair in Ithaca, the Little Country Theatre at Fargo, South\nDakota, and similar groups at the University of California and\nelsewhere, illustrate the leadership of the colleges. In many\nhigh schools, as at South Bend, Indiana, more or less complete\nLittle Theatres are active. The Chicago Little Theatre, the\nWisconsin Dramatic Society, the Provincetown Players, the\nNeighborhood Playhouse, in New York, and others of that ilk, are\nwell known and influential. They are extending the tradition of\nthe best European theatres in their attempts to cultivate\nexcellent and individual expression in drama. They realize that\nplays must be tested by actual performance,--though not\nnecessarily by the unnatural demands of success in competition\nwith Broadway revues and farce-melodramas,--and thus developed\ntoward a genuine artistic embodiment of the vast and varied life,\nthe manifold and deep idealism of this country.\n\n\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\n\nFor their courteous and generous cooperation the editor is\ngreatly indebted to the authors and publishers of all the plays\nincluded. He is equally grateful to other dramatists who were\npersonally as cordial in intention but quite impotent to grant\ncopyright privileges. In addition, he has received most friendly\nand cordial criticism from friends and friendly strangers to whom\nhe appealed--among others, from Mr. Harold Brighouse; Mr.\nTheodore Hinckley, editor of \"Drama\"; Mr. Clarence Stratton, now\nDirector of English at Cleveland, and author of a forthcoming\nbook on the Little Theatre in this country; Mr. Allan Monkhouse,\nauthor of \"Mary Broome\" and \"War Plays\"; Professor Allan Abbot,\nof Teachers College, Columbia University; Mr. Frank G. Thompkins,\nof Central High School, Detroit; Mrs. Mary Austin; Professor Earl\nB. Pence, of De Pauw University; Professor Brander Matthews; and\nMrs. Alice Chapin. Indebtedness to many lists is obvious,\nparticularly to that of the Drama League and the National Council\nof Teachers of English, and that of Professor Pence in the\n\"Illinois Bulletin.\"\n\n\"Ile\" is reprinted by special arrangement with the author and\nwith Boni and Liveright, publishers, New York. \"Ile\" is reprinted\nfrom the volume \"The Moon of The Caribbees\" and six other plays\nof the sea, which volume is one of the series of plays by Mr.\nO'Neill, the series including \"Beyond the Horizon,\" a drama in\nfour acts, \"The Straw,\" a play in three acts and five scenes,\n\"Gold,\" a play in four acts and \"Chris\" a play in four acts.\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION: ON THE READING OF PLAYS\n\n\nThe elder Dumas, who wrote many successful plays, as well as the\nfamous romances, said that all he needed for constructing a drama\nwas \"four boards, two actors, and a passion.\" What he meant by\npassion has been defined by a later French writer, Ferdinand\nBruneti\u00e8re, as a conflict of wills. The Philosopher of Butterbiggens,\nwhom you will meet early in this book, points out that \"what you\nare all the time wanting\" is \"your own way.\" When two strong\ndesires conflict and we wonder which is coming out ahead, we say\nthat the situation is dramatic. This clash is clearly defined in\nany effective play, from the crude melodrama in which the forces\nare hero and villain with pistols, to such subtle conflicts,\nbased on a man's misunderstanding of even his own motives and\npurposes, as in Mr. Middleton's \"Tides.\"\n\nIn comedy, and even in farce, struggle is clearly present. Here\nour sympathy is with people who engage in a not impossible\ncombat--against rather obvious villains who can be unmasked, or\nagainst such public opinion or popular conventions as can be\noverset. The hold of an absurd bit of gossip upon stupid people\nis firm enough in \"Spreading the News\"; but fortunately it must\nyield to facts at last. The Queen and the Knave of Hearts are\nsufficiently clever, with the aid of the superb cookery of the\nKnave's wife, to do away with an ancient and solemnly reverenced\nlaw of Pompdebile's court. So, too, the force of ancient loyalty\nand enthusiasm almost works a miracle in the invalid veteran of\n\"Gettysburg.\" And we feel sure that the uncanny powers of the\nBeggar will be no less successful in overturning the power of the\nKing in Mr. Parkhurst's play.\n\nAgain, in comedies as in mathematics, the problem is often solved\nby substitution. The soldier in Mr. Galsworthy's \"The Sun\" is\nable to find a satisfactory and apparently happy ending without\nachieving what he originally set out to gain. And the same is\ntrue of Jock in Mr. Brighouse's \"Lonesome-Like.\" Or the play\nwhich does not end as the chief character wishes may still prove\nnot too serious because, as in \"Fame and the Poet,\" the situation\nis merely inconvenient and absurd rather than tragic. Now and\nthen it is next to impossible to tell whether the ending is\ntragic or not; in the \"Land of Heart's Desire\" we must first\ndecide whether our sympathies are more with Shawn Bruin and with\nMaire's love for him, or with her keen desire to go\n\n  To where the woods, the stars, and the white streams\n  Are holding a continual festival.\n\nIt is natural for us to desire a happy ending in stories, as we\ndesire satisfying solutions of the problems in our own lives. And\nwhenever the forces at work are such as make it true and possible,\nnaturally this is the best ending for a story or a play. But where\npowerful and terrible influences have to be combated, only a poor\ndramatist will make use of mere chance, or compel his characters\nto do what such people really would not do, to bring about a\nfactitious \"happy ending.\" With the relentless, mighty arms of\nEngland engaged in hunting the defeated Highlanders after the\nBattle of Culloden, a play like \"Campbell of Kilmhor,\" in which we\nsympathize with the ill-fated Stewarts, cannot end happily. If\nthey had yielded under pressure and betrayed their comrades, we\nmight have pitied them, but we could not admire their action, and\nthere would have been no strong conclusion. In \"Riders to the\nSea,\" where the characters are compelled by bitter poverty to face\nthe relentless forces of storm and sea, and in \"The Biding to\nLithend,\" we expect a tragic end almost from the first lines of\nthe play. We recognize this same dramatic tensity of hopeless\nconflict in many stories as well as plays; it is most powerful in\nthree or four novels by George Eliot, George Meredith, and Thomas\nHardy.\n\nOne of the best ways to understand these as real stage plays is\nthrough some sort of dramatization. This does not mean, however,\nthat they need be produced with elaborate scenery and costumes,\nmemorizing, and rehearsal; often the best understanding may be\nsecured by quite informal reading in the class, with perhaps a hat\nand cloak and a lath sword or two for properties. With simply a\nclear space in the classroom for a stage, you and your\nimaginations can give all the performance necessary for realizing\nthese plays very well indeed. But, of course, you must clearly\nunderstand the lines and the play as a whole before you try to\ntake a part, so that you can read simply and naturally, as you\nthink the people in the story probably spoke. Some questions for\ndiscussion in the appendix may help you in talking the plays over\nin class or in reading them for yourself before you try to take a\npart. You will find it sometimes helps, also, to make a diagram or\na colored sketch of the scene as the author describes it, or even\na small model of the stage for a \"dramatic museum\" for your\nschool. If you have not tried this, you do not know how much it\nhelps in seeing plays of other times, like Shakespeare's or\nMoli\u00e8re's; and it is useful also for modern dramas. Such small\nstages can be used for puppet theatres as well. \"The Knave of\nHearts\" is intended as a marionette play, and other\ndramas--Maeterlinck's and even Shakespeare's--have been given in\nthis way with very interesting effects.\n\nIf you bring these plays to a performance for others outside your\nown class, you will find that the simplest and least pretentious\nsettings are generally most effective. The Irish players, as Mr.\nYeats tells us, \"have made scenery, indeed, but scenery that is\nlittle more than a suggestion--a pattern with recurring boughs and\nleaves of gold for a wood, a great green curtain, with a red\nstencil upon it to carry the eye upward, for a palace.\" Mr. John\nMerrill of the Francis Parker School describes the quite excellent\nresults secured with a dark curtain in a semicircle--a\ncyclorama--for background, and with colored lights.[1] Such a\nstaging leaves the attention free to follow the lines, and the\nimagination to picture whatever the play suggests as the place of\nthe action.\n\n[Footnote 1: John Merrill: \"Drama and the School,\" in _Drama_,\nNovember, 1919.]\n\n\n\n\nTHE PHILOSOPHER OF BUTTERBIGGENS[1]\n\nHarold Chapin\n\n[Footnote 1: Included by special permission of Mrs. Alice Chapin.\nPermission to present this play must be secured from Samuel\nFrench, 28 West 38th Street, New York City, who controls all\nacting rights, etc., in this country.]\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nDAVID PIRNIE LIZZIE, his daughter\nJOHN BELL, his son-in-law\nALEXANDER, John's little son\n\nSCENE: JOHN BELL'S _tenement at Butterbiggens. It consists of the\nvery usual \"two rooms, kitchen, and bath,\" a concealed bed in the\nparlor and another in the kitchen enabling him to house his\nfamily--consisting of himself, his wife, his little son, and his\naged father-in-law--therein. The kitchen-and-living-room is a\ngood-sized square room. The right wall (our right as we look at\nit) is occupied by a huge built-in dresser, sink, and coal bunker,\nthe left wall by a high-manteled, ovened, and boilered fireplace,\nthe recess on either side of which contains a low painted\ncupboard. Over the far cupboard hangs a picture of a ship, but\nover the near one is a small square window. The far wall has two\nlarge doors in it, that on the right leading to the lobby, and\nthat on the left appertaining to the old father-in-law's concealed\nbed. The walls are distempered a brickish red. The ceiling once\nwas white. The floor is covered with bright linoleum and a couple\nof rag rugs--one before the fire--a large one--and a smaller one\nbefore the door of the concealed bed._\n\n_A deal table is just to right of centre. A long flexible\ngas-bracket depends from the ceiling above it. Another\nmany-jointed gas-bracket projects from the middle of the high\nmantelpiece, its flame turned down towards the stove. There are\nwooden chairs at the table, above, below, and to left of it. A\nhigh-backed easy chair is above the fire, a kitchen elbow-chair\nbelow it._\n\n_The kitchen is very tidy. A newspaper newly fallen to the rug\nbefore the fire and another--an evening one--spread flat on the\ntable are (besides a child's mug and plate, also on the table)\nthe only things not stowed in their prescribed places. It is\nevening--the light beyond the little square window being the gray\ndimness of a long Northern twilight which slowly deepens during\nthe play. When the curtain rises it is still light enough in the\nroom for a man to read if the print be not too faint and his eyes\nbe good. The warm light of the fire leaps and flickers through\nthe gray, showing up with exceptional clearness the deep-lined\nface of old DAVID PIRNIE, who is discovered half-risen from his\narmchair above the fire, standing on the hearth-rug, his body\nbent and his hand on the chair arm. He is a little, feeble old\nman with a well-shaped head and weather-beaten face, set off by a\ngrizzled beard and whiskers, wiry and vigorous, in curious\ncontrast to the wreath of snowy hair that encircles his head. His\nupper lip is shaven. He wears an old suit--the unbuttoned\nwaistcoat of which shows an old flannel shirt. His slippers are\nlow at the heel and his socks loose at the ankles._\n\n_The old man's eyes are fixed appealingly on those of his\ndaughter, who stands in the half-open door, her grasp on the\nhandle, meeting his look squarely--a straight-browed,\nblack-haired, determined young woman of six or seven and twenty.\nHer husband_, JOHN, _seated at the table in his shirt-sleeves with\nhis head in his hands, reads hard at the paper and tries to look\nunconcerned._\n\n\nDAVID. Aw--but, Lizzie--\n\nLIZZIE (_with splendid firmness_). It's nae use, feyther. I'm no'\ngaein' to gie in to the wean. Ye've been tellin' yer stories to\nhim nicht after nicht for dear knows how long, and he's gettin'\nto expect them.\n\nDAVID. Why should he no' expect them?\n\nLIZZIE. It disna do for weans to count on things so. He's layin'\nup a sad disappointment for himself yin o' these days.\n\nDAVID. He's gettin' a sad disappointment the noo. Och, come on,\nLizzie. I'm no' gaein' to dee just yet, an' ye can break him off\ngradually when I begin to look like to.\n\nLIZZIE. Who's talkin' o' yer deein', feyther?\n\nDAVID. Ye were speakin' o' the disappointment he was layin' up\nfor himself if he got to count on me--\n\nLIZZIE. I wasna thinkin' o' yer deein', feyther--only--it's no\nguid for a bairn--\n\nDAVID. Where's the harm in my giein' him a bit story before he\ngangs tae his bed?\n\nLIZZIE. I'm no sayin' there's ony harm in it this yinst, feyther;\nbut it's no richt to gae on nicht after nicht wi' never a break--\n\nDAVID. Whit wey is it no richt if there's nae harm in it?\n\nLIZZIE. It's giein' in to the wean.\n\nDAVID. Whit wey should ye no' gie in to him if there's nae harm\nin it?\n\nLIZZIE (_keeping her patience with difficulty_). Because it gets\nhim into the habit.\n\nDAVID. But why should he no' get into the habit if there's nae\nharm in it?\n\n(_John at the table chuckles. Lizzie gives him a look, but he\nmeets it not._)\n\nLIZZIE. Really, feyther, ye micht be a wean yerself, ye're that\npersistent.\n\nDAVID. No, Lizzie, I'm no' persistent, I'm reasoning wi' ye. Ye\nsaid there was nae harm in my tellin' him a bit story, an' now ye\nsay I'm not to because it'll get him into the habit; an' what I'm\naskin' ye is, where's the harm o' his gettin' into the habit if\nthere's nae harm in it?\n\nLIZZIE. Oh, aye; ye can be gey clever, twistin' the words in my\nmouth, feyther; but richt is richt, an' wrang's wrang, for all\nyer cleverness.\n\nDAVID (_earnestly_). I'm no bein' clever ava, Lizzie,--no' the\nnoo,--I'm just tryin' to make ye see that, if ye admit there's\nnae harm in a thing, ye canna say there's ony harm in it, an'\n(_pathetically_) I'm wantin' to tell wee Alexander a bit story\nbefore he gangs to his bed.\n\nJOHN (_aside to her_). Och, wumman--\n\nLIZZIE. T'ts, John; ye'd gie in tae onybody if they were just\npersistent enough.\n\nJOHN. He's an auld man.\n\nLIZZIE (_really exasperated_). I ken fine he's an auld man, John,\nand ye're a young yin, an' Alexander's gaein' to be anither, an'\nI'm a lone wumman among the lot o' ye, but I'm no' gaein' to gie\nin to--\n\nJOHN (_bringing a fresh mind to bear upon the argument_). Efter a',\nLizzie, there's nae harm--\n\nLIZZIE (_almost with a scream of anger_). Och, now you've stairted,\nhave you? Harm. Harm. Harm. You're talkin' about harm, and I'm\ntalking about richt an' wrang. You'd see your son grow up a\ndrunken keelie, an' mebbe a thief an' a murderer, so long as you\ncould say there was nae harm in it.\n\nDAVID (_expostulating with some cause_). But I cudna say there was\nnae harm in that, Lizzie, an' I wudna. Only when there's nae\nharm--\n\nLIZZIE. Och. (_Exits, calling off to the cause of the trouble._)\nAre ye in yer bed yet, Alexander?\n\n(_Shuts door with a click._)\n\nDAVID (_standing on hearth-rug and shaking his head more in sorrow\nthan in anger_). She's no reasonable, ye ken, John; she disna\nargue fair. I'm no complaining o' her mither, but it's a wee\nthing hard that the only twa women I've known to be really chatty\nan' argumentative with should ha' been just like that. An' me\nthat fond o' women's society.\n\n(_He lowers himself into his chair._)\n\nJOHN. They're all like it.\n\nDAVID (_judiciously_). I wudna go sae far as to say that, John. Ye\nsee, I've only kent they twa to study carefully--an' it's no fair\nto judge the whole sex by just the twa examples, an' it\nwere--(_Running on_) But it's gey hard, an' I was wantin' to tell\nwee Alexander a special fine story the nicht. (_Removes glasses\nand blinks his eyes._) Aweel.\n\nJOHN (_comforting_). Mebbe the morn--\n\nDAVID. If it's no richt the nicht, it'll no be richt the morn's\nnicht.\n\nJOHN. Ye canna say that, feyther. It wasna wrang last nicht.\n\nDAVID (_bitterly_). Mebbe it was, an' Lizzie had no' foun' it out.\n\nJOHN. Aw, noo, feyther, dinna get saurcastic.\n\nDAVID (_between anger and tears, weakly_). I canna help it. I'm\nblack affrontit. I was wantin' to tell wee Alexander a special\nfine story the nicht, an' now here's Lizzie wi' her richt's richt\nan' wrang's wrang--Och, there's nae reason in the women.\n\nJOHN. We has to gie in to them though.\n\nDAVID. Aye. That's why.\n\n(_There is a pause. The old man picks up his paper again and\nsettles his glasses on his nose. JOHN rises, and with a spill\nfrom the mantelpiece lights the gas there, which he then bends to\nthrow the light to the old man's advantage._)\n\nDAVID. Thank ye, John. Do ye hear him?\n\nJOHN (_erect on hearth-rug_). Who?\n\nDAVID. Wee Alexander.\n\nJOHN. No.\n\nDAVID. Greetin' his heart out.\n\nJOHN. Och, he's no greetin'. Lizzie's wi' him.\n\nDAVID. I ken fine Lizzie's wi' him, but he's greetin' for a' her.\nHe was wantin' to hear yon story o' the kelpies up to Cross Hill\nwi' the tram--(_Breaking his mood impatiently_) Och.\n\nJOHN (_crossing to table and lighting up there_). It's gettin' dark\ngey early. We'll shin be haein' tea by the gas.\n\nDAVID (_rustling his paper_). Aye--(_Suddenly_) There never was a\nfemale philosopher, ye ken, John.\n\nJOHN. Was there no'?\n\nDAVID. No. (_Angrily, in a gust_) An'there never will be! (_Then\nmore calmly_) An' yet there's an' awful lot o' philosophy about\nwomen, John.\n\nJOHN. Aye?\n\nDAVID. Och, aye. They're that unreasonable, an' yet ye canna\nreason them down; an' they're that weak, an' yet ye canna make\nthem gie in tae ye. Of course, ye'll say ye canna reason doon a\nstane, or make a clod o' earth gie in tae ye.\n\nJOHN. Will I?\n\nDAVID. Aye. An' ye'll be richt. But then I'll tell ye a stane\nwill na answer ye back, an' a clod of earth will na try to\nwithstand ye, so how can ye argue them down?\n\nJOHN (_convinced_). Ye canna.\n\nDAVID. Richt! Ye canna! But a wumman _will_ answer ye back, an'\nshe _will_ stand against ye, an' _yet_ ye canna argue her down\nthough ye have strength an' reason on your side an' she's talkin'\nnaething but blether about richt's richt an' wrang's wrang, an'\nsendin' a poor bairn off t' his bed i' the yin room an' leavin'\nher auld feyther all alone by the fire in anither an'--ye\nken--Philosophy--\n\n(_He ceases to speak and wipes his glasses again. JOHN, intensely\ntroubled, tiptoes up to the door and opens it a foot. The wails\nof ALEXANDER can be heard muffled by a farther door. JOHN calls\noff._)\n\nJOHN. Lizzie.\n\n(_Lizzie immediately comes into sight outside the door with a\n\"Shsh.\"_)\n\nJOHN. Yer feyther's greetin'.\n\nLIZZIE (_with a touch of exasperation_). Och, I'm no heedin'!\nThere's another wean in there greetin' too, an' I'm no heedin'\nhim neither, an' he's greetin' twicet as loud as the auld yin.\n\nJOHN (_shocked_). Ye're heartless, wumman.\n\nLIZZIE (_with patience_). No, I'm no' heartless, John; but there's\ntoo much heart in this family, an' someone's got to use their\nheid.\n\n(DAVID _cranes round the side of his chair to catch what they\nare saying. She stops and comes to him kindly but with womanly\nfirmness._)\n\nLIZZIE. I'm vexed ye should be disappointed, feyther, but ye see,\ndon't ye--\n\n(_A singularly piercing wail from ALEXANDER goes up. LIZZIE rushes\nto silence him._)\n\nLIZZIE. Mercy! The neighbors will think we're murderin' him.\n\n(_The door closes behind her._)\n\nDAVID (_nodding for a space as he revolves the woman's attitude_).\nYe hear that, John?\n\nJOHN. Whit?\n\nDAVID (_with quiet irony_). She's vexed I should be disappointed.\nThe wumman thinks she's richt! Women always think they're\nricht--mebbe it's that that makes them that obstinate. (_With the\nghost of a twinkle_) She's feart o' the neighbors, though.\n\nJOHN (_stolidly_). A' women are feart o' the neighbors.\n\nDAVID (_reverting_). Puir wee man. I telt ye he was greetin', John.\nHe's disappointed fine. (_Pondering_) D' ye ken whit I'm thinkin',\nJohn?\n\nJOHN. Whit?\n\nDAVID. I'm thinkin' he's too young to get his ain way, an' I'm\ntoo auld, an' it's a fine thocht!\n\nJOHN. Aye?\n\nDAVID. Aye. I never thocht of it before, but that's what it is.\nHe's no' come to it yet, an' I'm past it. (_Suddenly_) What's the\nmost important thing in life, John?\n\n(JOHN _opens his mouth--and shuts it again unused._)\n\nDAVID. Ye ken perfectly well. What is it ye're wantin' a' the\ntime?\n\nJOHN. Different things.\n\nDAVID (_satisfied_). Aye--different things! But ye want them a', do\nye no'?\n\nJOHN. Aye.\n\nDAVID. If ye had yer ain way ye'd hae them a', eh?\n\nJOHN. I wud that.\n\nDAVID (_triumphant_). Then is that no' what ye want: yer ain way?\n\nJOHN (_enlightened_). Losh!\n\nDAVID (_warming to it_). That's what life is, John--gettin' yer ain\nway. First ye're born, an' ye canna dae anything but cry; but\nGod's given yer mither ears an' ye get yer way by just cryin' for\nit. (_Hastily, anticipating criticism_) I ken that's no exactly in\nkeeping with what I've been saying aboot Alexander--but a\nnew-born bairnie's an awfu' delicate thing, an' the Lord gets it\npast its infancy by a dispensation of Providence very unsettling\nto oor poor human understandings. Ye'll notice the weans cease\ngettin' their wey by juist greetin' for it as shin as they're old\nenough to seek it otherwise.\n\nJOHN. The habit hangs on to them whiles.\n\nDAVID. It does that. (_With a twinkle_) An' mebbe, if God's gi'en\nyer neighbors ears an' ye live close, ye'll get yer wey by a\ndispensation o' Providence a while longer. But there's things\nye'll hae to do for yerself gin ye want to--an' ye will. Ye'll\nwant to hold oot yer hand, an' ye will hold oot yer hand; an' ye\n'll want to stand up and walk, and ye _will_ stand up and\nwalk; an' ye'll want to dae as ye please, and ye _will_ dae\nas ye please; and then ye are practised an' lernt in the art of\ngettin' yer ain way--and ye're a man!\n\nJOHN. Man, feyther--ye're wonderful!\n\nDAVID (_complacently_). I'm a philosopher, John. But it goes on\nmebbe.\n\nJOHN. Aye?\n\nDavid. Aye: mebbe ye think ye'd like to make ither folk mind ye\nan' yer way, an' ye try, an' if it comes off ye're a big man an'\nmebbe the master o' a vessel wi' three men an' a boy under ye, as\nI was, John. (_Dropping into the minor_) An then ye come doon the\nhill.\n\nJOHN (_apprehensively_). Doon the hill?\n\nDAVID. Aye--doon to mebbe wantin' to tell a wean a bit story\nbefore he gangs tae his bed, an' ye canna dae even that. An' then\na while more an' ye want to get to yer feet an' walk, and ye\ncanna; an' a while more an' ye want to lift up yer hand, an' ye\ncanna--an' in a while more ye're just forgotten an' done wi'.\n\nJOHN. Aw, feyther!\n\nDAVID. Dinna look sae troubled, John. I'm no' afraid to dee when\nmy time comes. It's these hints that I'm done wi' before I'm dead\nthat I dinna like.\n\nJOHN. What'n hints?\n\nDAVID. Well--Lizzie an' her richt's richt and wrang's wrang when\nI think o' tellin' wee Alexander a bit story before he gangs tae\nhis bed.\n\nJOHN (_gently_). Ye are a wee thing persistent, feyther.\n\nDAVID. No, I'm no' persistent, John. I've gied in. I'm a\nphilosopher, John, an' a philosopher kens when he's done wi'.\n\nJOHN. Aw, feyther!\n\nDAVID (_getting lower and lower_). It's gey interesting,\nphilosophy, John, an' the only philosophy worth thinkin' about is\nthe philosophy of growing old--because that's what we're a' doing,\na' living things. There's nae philosophy in a stane, John; he's\njuist a stane, an' in a hundred years he'll be juist a stane\nstill--unless he's broken up, an' then he'll be juist not a\nstane, but he'll no' ken what's happened to him, because he didna\nbreak up gradual and first lose his boat an' then his hoose, an'\nthen hae his wee grandson taken away when he was for tellin' him\na bit story before he gangs tae his bed.--It's yon losing yer\ngrip bit by bit and kennin' that yer losin' it that makes a\nphilosopher, John.\n\nJOHN. If I kennt what ye meant by philosophy, feyther, I'd be\nbetter able to follow ye.\n\n(LIZZIE _enters quietly and closes door after her._)\n\nJOHN. Is he asleep?\n\nLIZZIE. No, he's no' asleep, but I've shut both doors, and the\nneighbors canna hear him.\n\nJOHN. Aw, Lizzie--\n\nLIZZIE (_sharply_). John--\n\nDAVID. Whit was I tellin' ye, John, about weans gettin' their ain\nway if the neighbors had ears an' they lived close? Was I no'\nricht?\n\nLIZZIE (_answering for JOHN with some acerbity_). Aye, ye were\nricht, feyther, nae doot; but we dinna live that close here, an'\nthe neighbors canna hear him at the back o' the hoose.\n\nDAVID. Mebbe that's why ye changed Alexander into the parlor an'\ngied me the bed in here when it began to get cold---\n\nLIZZIE (_hurt_). Aw, no, feyther; I brought ye in here to be\nwarmer--\n\nDAVID (_placably_). I believe ye, wumman--(_with a faint\ntwinkle_)--but it's turned oot luckily, has it no'?\n\n(_DAVID waits for a reply but gets none. LIZZIE fetches needlework\nfrom the dresser drawer and sits above table. DAVID'S face and\nvoice take on a more thoughtful tone._)\n\nDAVID (_musing_). Puir wee man! If he was in here you'd no' be\nletting him greet his heart oot where onybody could hear him. Wud\nye?\n\nLIZZIE (_calmly_). Mebbe I'd no'.\n\nJOHN. Ye ken fine ye'd no', wumman.\n\nLIZZIE. John, thread my needle an' dinna take feyther's part\nagainst me.\n\nJOHN (_surprised_). I'm no'.\n\nLIZZIE. No, I ken ye're no meanin' to, but you men are that\nthrang--\n\n(_She is interrupted by a loud squall from_ DAVID, _which he\nmaintains, eyes shut, chair-arms gripped, and mouth open, for\nnearly half a minute, before he cuts it off abruptly and looks at\nthe startled couple at the table._)\n\nLIZZIE. Mercy, feyther, whit's wrang wi' ye?\n\nDAVID (_collectedly_). There's naethin' wrang wi' me, Lizzie,\nexcept that I'm wantin' to tell wee Alexander a bit story--\n\nLIZZIE (_firmly but very kindly_). But ye're no' goin' to--\n\n(_She breaks off in alarm as her father opens his mouth\npreparatory to another yell, which however he postpones to speak\nto_ JOHN.)\n\nDAVID. Ye mind whit I was saying aboot the dispensation o'\nProvidence to help weans till they could try for theirselves,\nJohn?\n\nJOHN. Aye.\n\nDAVID. Did it no' occur to ye then that there ought to be some\nsort of dispensation to look after the auld yins who were past\nit?\n\nJOHN. No.\n\nDAVID. Aweel--it didna occur to me at the time--(_and he lets off\nanother prolonged wail_).\n\nLIZZIE (_going to him_). Shsh! Feyther! The neighbors will hear\nye!!!\n\nDAVID (_desisting as before_). I ken fine; _I'm_ no' at the\nback of the hoose. (_Shorter wail._)\n\nLIZZIE (_almost in tears_). They'll be coming to ask.\n\nDAVID. Let them. They'll no'ask _me_. (_Squall._)\n\nLIZZIE. Feyther--ye're no'behaving well. John--\n\nJOHN. Aye?\n\nLIZZIE (_helplessly_). Naething--feyther, stop it. They'll think\nye're clean daft.\n\nDAVID (_ceasing to howl and speaking with gravity_). I ken it fine,\nLizzie; an' it's no easy for a man who has been respeckit an'\nlookit up to a' his life to be thought daft at eighty-three; but\nthe most important thing in life is to get yer ain way. (_Resumes\nwailing._)\n\nLIZZIE (_puzzled, to_ JOHN). Whit's that?\n\nJOHN. It's his philosophy that he was talking aboot.\n\nDAVID (_firmly_). An' I'm gaein' to tell wee Alexander yon bit\nstory, tho' they think me daft for it.\n\nLIZZIE. But it's no' for his ain guid, feyther. I've telt ye so,\nbut ye wudna listen.\n\nDAVID. I wudna listen, wumman! It was you wudna listen to me when\nI axed ye whit harm--(_Chuckles.--Checking himself_) No! I'm no\ngaein' to hae that ower again. I've gied up arguing wi' women.\nI'm juist gaein' tae greet loud an' sair till wee Alexander's\nbrought in here to hae his bit story; an' if the neighbors--(_Loud\nsquall._)\n\nLIZZIE (_aside to_ JOHN). He's fair daft!\n\nJOHN (_aghast_). Ye'd no send him to--\n\nLIZZIE (_reproachfully_). John!\n\n(_A louder squall from the old man._)\n\nLIZZIE (_beating her hands together distractedly_). He'll be\n--We'll--He'll--Och!!! (_Resigned and beaten_) John, go and bring\nwee Alexander in here.\n\n(JOHN _is off like a shot. The opening of the door of the other\nroom can be told by the burst of_ ALEXANDER'S _voice. The old man's\nwails have stopped the second his daughter capitulated. JOHN\nreturns with_ ALEXANDER _and bears him to his grandfather's waiting\nknee. The boy's tears and howls have ceased and he is smiling\ntriumphantly. He is of course in his night-shirt and a blanket,\nwhich Grandpa wraps round him, turning toward the fire._)\n\nLIZZIE (_looking on with many nods of the head and smacks of the\nlips_). There you are! That's the kind o' boy he is. Greet his\nheart oot for a thing an' stop the moment he gets it.\n\nDAVID. Dae ye expect him to gae on after he's got it? Ah, but,\nAlexander, ye didna get it yer lane this time; it took the twa o'\nus. An' hard work it was for the Auld Yin! Man! (_Playing\nhoarse_)\n\nI doot I've enough voice left for a--(_Bursting out very loud\nand making the boy laugh._) Aweel!

FALLON\nJACK SMIT\nSHAWN EARLY\nTIM CASEY\nJAMES RYAN\nMRS. TARPEY\nMRS. TULLY\nJOE MULDOON, a policeman\nA REMOVABLE MAGISTRATE\n\nSCENE: _The outskirts of a Fair. An Apple Stall._ MRS. TARPEY\n_sitting at it._ MAGISTRATE _and_ POLICEMAN _enter._\n\n\nMAGISTRATE. So that is the Fair Green. Cattle and sheep and mud.\nNo system. What a repulsive sight!\n\nPOLICEMAN. That is so, indeed.\n\nMAGISTRATE. I suppose there is a good deal of disorder in this\nplace?\n\nPOLICEMAN. There is.\n\nMAGISTRATE. Common assault?\n\nPOLICEMAN. It's common enough.\n\nMAGISTRATE. Agrarian crime, no doubt?\n\nPOLICEMAN. That is so.\n\nMAGISTRATE. Boycotting? Maiming of cattle? Firing into houses?\n\nPOLICEMAN. There was one time, and there might be again.\n\nMAGISTRATE. That is bad. Does it go any farther than that?\n\nPOLICEMAN. Far enough, indeed.\n\nMAGISTRATE. Homicide, then! This district has been shamefully\nneglected! I will change all that. When I was in the Andaman\nIslands, my system never failed. Yes, yes, I will change all\nthat. What has that woman on her stall?\n\nPOLICEMAN. Apples mostly--and sweets.\n\nMAGISTRATE. Just see if there are any unlicensed goods\nunderneath--spirits or the like. We had evasions of the salt tax\nin the Andaman Islands.\n\nPOLICEMAN (_sniffing cautiously and upsetting a heap of apples_). I\nsee no spirits here--or salt.\n\nMAGISTRATE (_to_ MRS. TARPEY). Do you know this town well, my good\nwoman?\n\nMRS. TARPEY (_holding out some apples_). A penny the half-dozen,\nyour honor.\n\nPOLICEMAN (_shouting_). The gentleman is asking do you know the\ntown! He's the new magistrate!\n\nMRS. TARPEY (_rising and ducking_). Do I know the town? I do, to be\nsure.\n\nMAGISTRATE (_shouting_). What is its chief business?\n\nMRS, TARPEY. Business, is it? What business would the people here\nhave but to be minding one another's business?\n\nMAGISTRATE. I mean what trade have they?\n\nMRS. TARPEY. Not a trade. No trade at all but to be talking.\n\nMAGISTRATE. I shall learn nothing here.\n\n(JAMES RYAN _comes in, pipe in mouth. Seeing MAGISTRATE, he\nretreats quickly, taking pipe from mouth._)\n\nMAGISTRATE. The smoke from that man's pipe had a greenish look;\nhe may be growing unlicensed tobacco at home. I wish I had\nbrought my telescope to this district. Come to the post-office; I\nwill telegraph for it. I found it very useful in the Andaman\nIslands.\n\n(MAGISTRATE _and_ POLICEMAN _go out left._)\n\nMRS. TARPEY. Bad luck to Jo Muldoon, knocking my apples this way\nand that way. (_Begins arranging them._) Showing off he was to the\nnew magistrate.\n\n(_Enter_ BARTLEY FALLON _and_ MRS. FALLON.)\n\nBARTLEY. Indeed it's a poor country and a scarce country to be\nliving in. But I'm thinking if I went to America it's long ago\nthe day I'd be dead!\n\nMRS. FALLON. So you might, indeed.\n\n(_She puts her basket on a barrel and begins putting parcels in\nit, taking them from under her cloak._)\n\nBARTLEY. And it's a great expense for a poor man to be buried in\nAmerica.\n\nMRS. FALLON. Never fear, Bartley Fallon, but I'll give you a good\nburying the day you'll die.\n\nBARTLEY. Maybe it's yourself will be buried in the graveyard of\nCloonmara before me, Mary Fallon, and I myself that will be dying\nunbeknownst some night, and no one a-near me. And the cat itself\nmay be gone straying through the country, and the mice squealing\nover the quilt.\n\nMRS. FALLON. Leave off talking of dying. It might be twenty years\nyou'll be living yet.\n\nBARTLEY (_with a deep sigh_). I'm thinking if I'll be living at the\nend of twenty years, it's a very old man I'll be then!\n\nMRS. TARPEY (_turns and sees them_). Good-morrow, Bartley Fallon;\ngood-morrow, Mrs. Fallon. Well, Bartley, you'll find no cause for\ncomplaining to-day; they are all saying it was a good fair.\n\nBARTLEY (_raising his voice_). It was not a good fair, Mrs. Tarpey.\nIt was a scattered sort of a fair. If we didn't expect more, we\ngot less. That's the way with me always: whatever I have to sell\ngoes down and whatever I have to buy goes up. If there's ever any\nmisfortune coming to this world, it's on myself it pitches, like\na flock of crows on seed potatoes.\n\nMRS. FALLON. Leave off talking of misfortunes, and listen to Jack\nSmith that is coming the way, and he singing.\n\n(_Voice of JACK SMITH heard singing_)\n\n  I thought, my first love,\n    There'd be but one house between you and me.\n  And I thought I would find\n    Yourself coaxing my child on your knee.\n  Over the tide\n    I would leap with the leap of a swan.\n  Till I came to the side\n    Of the wife of the red-haired man!\n\n(JACK SMITH _comes in; he is a red-haired man, and is carrying a\nhayfork._)\n\nMRS. TARPEY. That should be a good song if I had my hearing.\n\nMRS. FALLON (_shouting_). It's \"The Red-haired Man's Wife.\"\n\nMRS. TARPEY. I know it well. That's the song that has a skin on\nit!\n\n(_She turns her back to them and goes on arranging her apples._)\n\nMRS. FALLON. Where's herself, Jack Smith?\n\nJACK SMITH. She was delayed with her washing; bleaching the\nclothes on the hedge she is, and she daren't leave them, with all\nthe tinkers that do be passing to the fair. It isn't to the fair\nI came myself, but up to the Five-Acre Meadow I'm going, where I\nhave a contract for the hay. We'll get a share of it into tramps\nto-day.\n\n(_He lays down hayfork and lights his pipe._)\n\nBARTLEY. You will not get it into tramps to-day. The rain will be\ndown on it by evening, and on myself too. It's seldom I ever\nstarted on a journey but the rain would come down on me before\nI'd find any place of shelter.\n\nJACK SMITH. If it didn't itself, Bartley, it is my belief you\nwould carry a leaky pail on your head in place of a hat, the way\nyou'd not be without some cause of complaining.\n\n(_A voice heard: \"Go on, now, go on out o' that. Go on, I say.\"_)\n\nJACK SMITH. Look at that young mare of Pat Ryan's that is backing\ninto Shaughnessy's bullocks with the dint of the crowd! Don't be\ndaunted, Pat, I'll give you a hand with her. (_He goes out,\nleaving his hayfork._)\n\nMRS. FALLON. It's time for ourselves to be going home. I have all\nI bought put in the basket. Look at there, Jack Smith's hayfork\nhe left after him! He'll be wanting it. (_Calls_) Jack Smith! Jack\nSmith!--He's gone through the crowd; hurry after him, Bartley,\nhe'll be wanting it.\n\nBARTLEY. I'll do that. This is no safe place to be leaving it.\n(_He takes up fork awkwardly and upsets the basket._) Look at that\nnow! If there is any basket in the fair upset, it must be our own\nbasket! (_He goes out to right._)\n\nMRS. FALLON. Get out of that! It is your own fault, it is. Talk\nof misfortunes and misfortunes will come. Glory be! Look at my\nnew egg-cups rolling in every part--and my two pound of sugar\nwith the paper broke--\n\nMRS. TARPEY (_turning from stall_). God help us, Mrs. Fallon, what\nhappened your basket?\n\nMRS. FALLON. It's himself that knocked it down, bad manners to\nhim. (_Putting things up_) My grand sugar that's destroyed, and\nhe'll not drink his tea without it. I had best go back to the\nshop for more, much good may it do him!\n\n(_Enter_ TIM CASEY.)\n\nTIM CASEY. Where is Bartley Fallon, Mrs. Fallon? I want a word\nwith him before he'll leave the fair. I was afraid he might have\ngone home by this, for he's a temperate man.\n\nMRS. FALLON. I wish he did go home! It'd be best for me if he\nwent home straight from the fair green, or if he never came with\nme at all! Where is he, is it? He's gone up the road (_jerks\nelbow_) following Jack Smith with a hayfork.\n\n(_She goes out to left._)\n\nTIM CASEY. Following Jack Smith with a hayfork! Did ever anyone\nhear the like of that. (_Shouts_) Did you hear that news, Mrs.\nTarpey?\n\nMRS. TARPEY. I heard no news at all.\n\nTIM CASEY. Some dispute I suppose it was that rose between Jack\nSmith and Bartley Fallon, and it seems Jack made off, and Bartley\nis following him with a hayfork!\n\nMRS. TARPEY. Is he now? Well, that was quick work! It's not ten\nminutes since the two of them were here, Bartley going home and\nJack going to the Five-Acre Meadow; and I had my apples to settle\nup, that Jo Muldoon of the police had scattered, and when I\nlooked round again Jack Smith was gone, and Bartley Fallon was\ngone, and Mrs. Fallon's basket upset, and all in it strewed upon\nthe ground--the tea here--the two pound of sugar there--the\negg-cups there. Look, now, what a great hardship the deafness\nputs upon me, that I didn't hear the commincement of the fight!\nWait till I tell James Ryan that I see below; he is a neighbor of\nBartley's; it would be a pity if he wouldn't hear the news!\n\n(_She goes out. Enter_ SHAWN EARLY _and_ MRS. TULLY.)\n\nTIM CASEY. Listen, Shawn Early! Listen, Mrs. Tully, to the news!\nJack Smith and Bartley Fallon had a falling out, and Jack knocked\nMrs. Fallon's basket into the road, and Bartley made an attack on\nhim with a hayfork, and away with Jack, and Bartley after him.\nLook at the sugar here yet on the road!\n\nSHAWN EARLY. Do you tell me so? Well, that's a queer thing, and\nBartley Fallen so quiet a man!\n\nMRS. TULLY. I wouldn't wonder at all. I would never think well of\na man that would have that sort of a moldering look. It's likely\nhe has overtaken Jack by this.\n\n(_Enter_ JAMES RYAN _and_ MRS. TARPEY.)\n\nJAMES RYAN. That is great news Mrs. Tarpey was telling me! I\nsuppose that's what brought the police and the magistrate up this\nway. I was wondering to see them in it a while ago.\n\nSHAWN EARLY. The police after them? Bartley Fallen must have\ninjured Jack so. They wouldn't meddle in a fight that was only\nfor show!\n\nMRS. TULLY. Why wouldn't he injure him? There was many a man\nkilled with no more of a weapon than a hayfork.\n\nJAMES RYAN. Wait till I run north as far as Kelly's bar to spread\nthe news!\n\n(_He goes out._)\n\nTIM CASEY. I'll go tell Jack Smith's first cousin that is\nstanding there south of the church after selling his lambs.\n\n(_Goes out._)\n\nMRS. TULLY. I'll go telling a few of the neighbors I see beyond\nto the west.\n\n(_Goes out._)\n\nSHAWN EARLY. I'll give word of it beyond at the east of the\ngreen.\n\n(_Is going out when MRS. TARPEY seizes hold of him._)\n\nMRS. TARPEY. Stop a minute, Shawn Early, and tell me did you see\nred Jack Smith's wife, Kitty Keary, in any place?\n\nSHAWN EARLY. I did. At her own house she was, drying clothes on\nthe hedge as I passed.\n\nMRS. TARPEY. What did you say she was doing?\n\nSHAWN EARLY (_breaking away_). Laying out a sheet on the hedge.\n\n(_He goes._)\n\nMRS. TARPEY. Laying out a sheet for the dead! The Lord have mercy\non us! Jack Smith dead, and his wife laying out a sheet for his\nburying! (_Calls out_) Why didn't you tell me that before, Shawn\nEarly? Isn't the deafness the great hardship? Half the world\nmight be dead without me knowing of it or getting word of it at\nall! (_She sits down and rocks herself._) O my poor Jack Smith! To\nbe going to his work so nice and so hearty, and to be left\nstretched on the ground in the full light of the day!\n\n(_Enter_ TIM CASEY.)\n\nTIM CASEY. What is it, Mrs. Tarpey? What happened since?\n\nMRS. TARPEY. O my poor Jack Smith!\n\nTIM CASEY. Did Bartley overtake him?\n\nMRS. TARPEY. O the poor man!\n\nTIM CASEY. Is it killed he is?\n\nMRS. TARPEY. Stretched in the Five-Acre Meadow!\n\nTIM CASEY. The Lord have mercy on us! Is that a fact?\n\nMRS. TARPEY. Without the rites of the Church or a ha'porth!\n\nTIM CASEY. Who was telling you?\n\nMRS. TARPEY. And the wife laying out a sheet for his corpse.\n(_Sits up and wipes her eyes._) I suppose they'll wake him the same\nas another?\n\n(_Enter_ MRS. TULLY, SHAWN EARLY, _and_ JAMES RYAN.)\n\nMRS. TULLY. There is great talk about this work in every quarter\nof the fair.\n\nMRS. TARPEY. Ochone! cold and dead. And myself maybe the last he\nwas speaking to!\n\nJAMES RYAN. The Lord save us! Is it dead he is?\n\nTIM CASEY. Dead surely, and the wife getting provision for the\nwake.\n\nSHAWN EARLY. Well, now, hadn't Bartley Fallon great venom in him?\n\nMRS. TULLY. You may be sure he had some cause. Why would he have\nmade an end of him if he had not? (_To MRS. TARPEY, raising her\nvoice_) What was it rose the dispute at all, Mrs. Tarpey?\n\nMRS. TARPEY. Not a one of me knows. The last I saw of them, Jack\nSmith was standing there, and Bartley Fallon was standing there,\nquiet and easy, and he listening to \"The Red-haired Man's Wife.\"\n\nMRS. TULLY. Do you hear that, Tim Casey? Do you hear that, Shawn\nEarly and James Ryan? Bartley Fallon was here this morning\nlistening to red Jack Smith's wife, Kitty Keary that was!\nListening to her and whispering with her! It was she started the\nfight so!\n\nSHAWN EARLY. She must have followed him from her own house. It is\nlikely some person roused him.\n\nTIM CASEY. I never knew, before, Bartley Fallon was great with\nJack Smith's wife.\n\nMRS. TULLY. How would you know it? Sure it's not in the streets\nthey would be calling it. If Mrs. Fallon didn't know of it, and\nif I that have the next house to them didn't know of it, and if\nJack Smith himself didn't know of it, it is not likely you would\nknow of it, Tim Casey.\n\nSHAWN EARLY. Let Bartley Fallon take charge of her from this out\nso, and let him provide for her. It is little pity she will get\nfrom any person in this parish.\n\nTIM CASEY. How can he take charge of her? Sure he has a wife of\nhis own. Sure you don't think he'd turn souper and marry her in a\nProtestant church?\n\nJAMES RYAN. It would be easy for him to marry her if he brought\nher to America.\n\nSHAWN EARLY. With or without Kitty Keary, believe me, it is for\nAmerica he's making at this minute. I saw the new magistrate and\nJo Muldoon of the police going into the post-office as I came\nup--there was hurry on them--you may be sure it was to telegraph\nthey went, the way he'll be stopped in the docks at Queenstown!\n\nMRS. TULLY. It's likely Kitty Keary is gone with him, and not\nminding a sheet or a wake at all. The poor man, to be deserted by\nhis own wife, and the breath hardly gone out yet from his body\nthat is lying bloody in the field!\n\n(_Enter_ MRS. FALLON.)\n\nMRS. FALLON. What is it the whole of the town is talking about?\nAnd what is it you yourselves are talking about? Is it about my\nman Bartley Fallon you are talking? Is it lies about him you are\ntelling, saying that he went killing Jack Smith? My grief that\never he came into this place at all!\n\nJAMES RYAN. Be easy now, Mrs. Fallon. Sure there is no one at all\nin the whole fair but is sorry for you!\n\nMRS. FALLON. Sorry for me, is it? Why would anyone be sorry for\nme? Let you be sorry for yourselves, and that there may be shame\non you forever and at the day of judgment, for the words you are\nsaying and the lies you are telling to take away the character of\nmy poor man, and to take the good name off of him, and to drive\nhim to destruction! That is what you are doing!\n\nSHAWN EARLY. Take comfort now, Mrs. Fallon. The police are not so\nsmart as they think. Sure he might give them the slip yet, the\nsame as Lynchehaun.\n\nMRS. TULLY. If they do get him, and if they do put a rope around\nhis neck, there is no one can say he does not deserve it!\n\nMRS. FALLON. Is that what you are saying, Bridget Tully, and is\nthat what you think? I tell you it's too much talk you have,\nmaking yourself out to be such a great one, and to be running\ndown every respectable person! A rope, is it? It isn't much of a\nrope was needed to tie up your own furniture the day you came\ninto Martin Tully's house, and you never bringing as much as a\nblanket, or a penny, or a suit of clothes with you, and I myself\nbringing seventy pounds and two feather beds. And now you are\nstiffer than a woman would have a hundred pounds! It is too much\ntalk the whole of you have. A rope is it? I tell you the whole of\nthis town is full of liars and schemers that would hang you up\nfor half a glass of whiskey (_turning to go_). People they are you\nwouldn't believe as much as daylight from, without you'd get up\nto have a look at it yourself. Killing Jack Smith indeed! Where\nare you at all, Bartley, till I bring you out of this? My nice\nquiet little man! My decent comrade! He that is as kind and as\nharmless as an innocent beast of the field! He'll be doing no\nharm at all if he'll shed the blood of some of you after this\nday's work! That much would be no harm at all. (_Calls out_)\nBartley! Bartley Fallen! Where are you? (_Going out_) Did anyone\nsee Bartley Fallon?\n\n(_All turn to look after her._)\n\nJAMES RYAN. It is hard for her to believe any such a thing, God\nhelp her!\n\n(_Enter BARTLEY FALLON from right, carrying hayfork._)\n\nBARTLEY. It is what I often said to myself, if there is ever any\nmisfortune coming to this world it is on myself it is sure to\ncome!\n\n(_All turn round and face him._)\n\nBARTLEY. To be going about with this fork and to find no one to\ntake it, and no place to leave it down, and I wanting to be gone\nout of this--Is that you, Shawn Early?\n\n(_Holds out fork._) It's well I met you. You have no call to be\nleaving the fair for a while the way I have, and how can I go\ntill I'm rid of this fork? Will you take it and keep it until\nsuch time as Jack Smith--\n\nSHAWN EARLY (_backing_). I will not take it, Bartley Fallon, I'm\nvery thankful to you!\n\nBARTLEY (_turning to apple stall_). Look at it now, Mrs. Tarpey, it\nwas here I got it; let me thrust it in under the stall. It will\nlie there safe enough, and no one will take notice of it until\nsuch time as Jack Smith--\n\nMRS. TARPEY. Take your fork out of that! Is it to put trouble on\nme and to destroy me you want? putting it there for the police to\nbe rooting it out maybe.\n\n(_Thrusts him back._)\n\nBARTLEY. That is a very unneighborly thing for you to do, Mrs.\nTarpey. Hadn't I enough care on me with that fork before this,\nrunning up and down with it like the swinging of a clock, and\nafeard to lay it down in any place! I wish I'd never touched it\nor meddled with it at all!\n\nJAMES RYAN. It is a pity, indeed, you ever did.\n\nBARTLEY. Will you yourself take it, James Ryan? You were always a\nneighborly man.\n\nJAMES RYAN (_backing_). There is many a thing I would do for you,\nBartley Fallon, but I won't do that!\n\nSHAWN EARLY. I tell you there is no man will give you any help or\nany encouragement for this day's work. If it was something\nagrarian now--\n\nBARTLEY. If no one at all will take it, maybe it's best to give\nit up to the police.\n\nTIM CASEY. There'd be a welcome for it with them surely!\n\n(_Laughter._)\n\nMRS. TULLY. And it is to the police Kitty Keary herself will be\nbrought.\n\nMRS. TARPEY (_rocking to and fro_). I wonder now who will take the\nexpense of the wake for poor Jack Smith?\n\nBARTLEY. The wake for Jack Smith!\n\nTIM CASEY. Why wouldn't he get a wake as well as another? Would\nyou begrudge him that much?\n\nBARTLEY. Red Jack Smith dead! Who was telling you?\n\nSHAWN EARLY. The whole town knows of it by this.\n\nBARTLEY. Do they say what way did he die?\n\nJAMES RYAN. You don't know that yourself, I suppose, Bartley\nFallon? You don't know he was followed and that he was laid dead\nwith the stab of a hayfork?\n\nBARTLEY. The stab of a hayfork!\n\nSHAWN EARLY. You don't know, I suppose, that the body was found\nin the Five-Acre Meadow?\n\nBARTLEY. The Five-Acre Meadow!\n\nTIM CASEY. It is likely you don't know that the police are after\nthe man that did it?\n\nBARTLEY. The man that did it!\n\nMRS. TULLY. You don't know, maybe, that he was made away with for\nthe sake of Kitty Keary, his wife?\n\nBARTLEY. Kitty Keary, his wife! (_Sits down bewildered._)\n\nMRS. TULLY. And what have you to say now, Bartley Fallon?\n\nBARTLEY (_crossing himself_). I to bring that fork here, and to\nfind that news before me! It is much if I can ever stir from this\nplace at all, or reach as far as the road!\n\nTIM CASEY. Look, boys, at the new magistrate, and Jo Muldoon\nalong with him! It's best for us to quit this.\n\nSHAWN EARLY. That is so. It is best not to be mixed in this\nbusiness at all.\n\nJAMES RYAN. Bad as he is, I wouldn't like to be an informer\nagainst any man.\n\n(_All hurry away except_ MRS. TARPEY, _who remains behind her stall.\nEnter_ MAGISTRATE _and_ POLICEMAN.)\n\nMAGISTRATE. I knew the district was in a bad state, but I did not\nexpect to be confronted with a murder at the first fair I came\nto.\n\nPOLICEMAN. I am sure you did not, indeed.\n\nMAGISTRATE. It was well I had not gone home. I caught a few words\nhere and there that roused my suspicions.\n\nPOLICEMAN. So they would, too.\n\nMAGISTRATE. You heard the same story from everyone you asked?\n\nPOLICEMAN. The same story--or if it was not altogether the same,\nanyway it was no less than the first story.\n\nMAGISTRATE. What is that man doing? He is sitting alone with a\nhayfork. He has a guilty look. The murder was done with a\nhayfork!\n\nPOLICEMAN (_in a whisper_). That's the very man they say did the\nact, Bartley Fallon himself!\n\nMAGISTRATE. He must have found escape difficult--he is trying to\nbrazen it out. A convict in the Andaman Islands tried the same\ngame, but he could not escape my system! Stand aside--Don't go\nfar--Have the handcuffs ready. (_He walks up to BARTLEY, folds his\narms, and stands before him._) Here, my man, do you know anything\nof John Smith?\n\nBARTLEY. Of John Smith! Who is he, now?\n\nPOLICEMAN. Jack Smith, sir--Red Jack Smith!\n\nMAGISTRATE (_coming a step nearer and tapping him on the\nshoulder_). Where is Jack Smith?\n\nBARTLEY (_with a deep sigh, and shaking his head slowly_). Where is\nhe, indeed?\n\nMAGISTRATE. What have you to tell?\n\nBARTLEY. It is where he was this morning, standing in this spot,\nsinging his share of songs--no, but lighting his pipe--scraping a\nmatch on the sole of his shoe--\n\nMAGISTRATE. I ask you, for the third time, where is he?\n\nBARTLEY. I wouldn't like to say that. It is a great mystery, and\nit is hard to say of any man, did he earn hatred or love.\n\nMAGISTRATE. Tell me all you know.\n\nBARTLEY. All that I know--Well, there are the three estates;\nthere is Limbo, and there is Purgatory, and there is--\n\nMAGISTRATE. Nonsense! This is trifling! Get to the point.\n\nBARTLEY. Maybe you don't hold with the clergy so? That is the\nteaching of the clergy. Maybe you hold with the old people. It is\nwhat they do be saying, that the shadow goes wandering, and the\nsoul is tired, and the body is taking a rest--The shadow! (_Starts\nup._) I was nearly sure I saw Jack Smith not ten minutes ago at\nthe corner of the forge, and I lost him again--Was it his ghost I\nsaw, do you think?\n\nMAGISTRATE (_to_ POLICEMAN). Conscience-struck! He will confess all\nnow!\n\nBARTLEY. His ghost to come before me! It is likely it was on\naccount of the fork! I to have it and he to have no way to defend\nhimself the time he met with his death!\n\nMAGISTRATE (_to_ POLICEMAN). I must note down his words. (_Takes out\nnotebook. To_ BARTLEY) I warn you that your words are being noted.\n\nBARTLEY. If I had ha' run faster in the beginning, this terror\nwould not be on me at the latter end! Maybe he will cast it up\nagainst me at the day of judgment--I wouldn't wonder at all at\nthat.\n\nMAGISTRATE (_writing_). At the day of judgment--\n\nBARTLEY. It was soon for his ghost to appear to me--is it coming\nafter me always by day it will be, and stripping the clothes off\nin the nighttime?--I wouldn't wonder at all at that, being as I\nam an unfortunate man!\n\nMAGISTRATE (_sternly_). Tell me this truly. What was the motive of\nthis crime?\n\nBARTLEY. The motive, is it?\n\nMAGISTRATE. Yes, the motive; the cause.\n\nBARTLEY. I'd sooner not say that.\n\nMAGISTRATE. You'd better tell me truly. Was it money?\n\nBARTLEY. Not at all! What did poor Jack Smith ever have in his\npockets unless it might be his hands that would be in them?\n\nMAGISTRATE. Any dispute about land?\n\nBARTLEY (_indignantly_). Not at all! He never was a grabber or\ngrabbed from anyone!\n\nMAGISTRATE. You will find it better for you if you tell me at\nonce.\n\nBARTLEY. I tell you I wouldn't for the whole world wish to say\nwhat it was--it is a thing I would not like to be talking about.\n\nMAGISTRATE. There is no use in hiding it. It will be discovered\nin the end.\n\nBARTLEY. Well, I suppose it will, seeing that mostly everybody\nknows it before. Whisper here now. I will tell no lie; where\nwould be the use? (_Puts his hand to his mouth and MAGISTRATE\nstoops._) Don't be putting the blame on the parish, for such a\nthing was never done in the parish before--it was done for the\nsake of Kitty Keary, Jack Smith's wife.\n\nMAGISTRATE (_to_ POLICEMAN). Put on the handcuffs. We have been\nsaved some trouble. I knew he would confess if taken in the right\nway.\n\n(POLICEMAN _puts on handcuffs._)\n\nBARTLEY. Handcuffs now! Glory be! I always said, if there was\never any misfortune coming to this place it was on myself it\nwould fall. I to be in handcuffs! There's no wonder at all in\nthat.\n\n(_Enter MRS. FALLON, followed by the rest. She is looking back at\nthem as she speaks._)\n\nMRS. FALLON. Telling lies the whole of the people of this town\nare; telling lies, telling lies as fast as a dog will trot!\nSpeaking against my poor respectable man! Saying he made an end\nof Jack Smith! My decent comrade! There is no better man and no\nkinder man in the whole of the five parishes! It's little\nannoyance he ever gave to anyone! (_Turns and sees him._) What in\nthe earthly world do I see before me? Bartley Fallon in charge of\nthe police! Handcuffs on him! O Bartley, Bartley, what did you do\nat all at all?\n\nBAHTLEY. O Mary, there has a great misfortune come upon me! It is\nwhat I always said, that if there is ever any misfortune--\n\nMRS. FALLON. What did he do at all, or is it bewitched I am?\n\nMAGISTRATE. This man has been arrested on a charge of murder.\n\nMRS. FALLON. Whose charge is that? Don't believe them! They are\nall liars in this place! Give me back my man!\n\nMAGISTRATE. It is natural you should take his part, but you have\nno cause of complaint against your neighbors. He has been\narrested for the murder of John Smith, on his own confession.\n\nMRS. FALLON. The saints of heaven protect us! And what did he\nwant killing Jack Smith?\n\nMAGISTRATE. It is best you should know all. He did it on account\nof a love-affair with the murdered man's wife.\n\nMRS. FALLON (_sitting down_). With Jack Smith's wife! With Kitty\nKeary!--Ochone, the traitor!\n\nTHE CROWD. A great shame, indeed. He is a traitor, indeed.\n\nMRS. TULLY. To America he was bringing her, Mrs. Fallon.\n\nBAETLEY. What are you saying, Mary? I tell you--\n\nMRS. FALLON. Don't say a word! I won't listen to any word you'll\nsay! (_Stops her ears._) Oh, isn't he the treacherous villain?\nOhone go deo!\n\nBARTLEY. Be quiet till I speak! Listen to what I say!\n\nMRS. FALLON. Sitting beside me on the ass car coming to the town,\nso quiet and so respectable, and treachery like that in his\nheart!\n\nBARTLEY. Is it your wits you have lost, or is it I myself that\nhave lost my wits?\n\nMRS. FALLON. And it's hard I earned you, slaving, slaving--and\nyou grumbling, and sighing, and coughing, and discontented, and\nthe priest wore out anointing you, with all the times you\nthreatened to die!\n\nBARTLEY. Let you be quiet till I tell you!\n\nMRS. FALLON. You to bring such a disgrace into the parish. A\nthing that was never heard of before!\n\nBARTLEY. Will you shut your mouth and hear me speaking?\n\nMRS. FALLON. And if it was for any sort of a fine handsome woman,\nbut for a little fistful of a woman like Kitty Keary, that's not\nfour feet high hardly, and not three teeth in her head unless she\ngot new ones! May God reward you, Bartley Fallon, for the black\ntreachery in your heart and the wickedness in your mind, and the\nred blood of poor Jack Smith that is wet upon your hand!\n\n(_Voice of JACK SMITH heard singing_)\n\n  The sea shall be dry,\n    The earth under mourning and ban!\n  Then loud shall he cry\n    For the wife of the red-haired man!\n\nBARTLEY. It's Jack Smith's voice--I never knew a ghost to sing\nbefore. It is after myself and the fork he is coming! (_Goes back.\nEnter_ JACK SMITH.) Let one of you give him the fork and I will be\nclear of him now and for eternity!\n\nMRS. TARPEY. The Lord have mercy on us! Red Jack Smith! The man\nthat was going to be waked!\n\nJAMES RYAN. Is it back from the grave you are come?\n\nSHAWN EARLY. Is it alive you are, or is it dead you are?\n\nTIM CASEY. Is it yourself at all that's in it?\n\nMRS. TULLY. Is it letting on you were to be dead?\n\nMRS. FALLON. Dead or alive, let you stop Kitty Keary, your wife,\nfrom bringing my man away with her to America!\n\nJACK SMITH. It is what I think, the wits are gone astray on the\nwhole of you. What would my wife want bringing Bartley Fallon to\nAmerica?\n\nMRS. FALLON. To leave yourself, and to get quit of you she wants,\nJack Smith, and to bring him away from myself. That's what the\ntwo of them had settled together.\n\nJACK SMITH. I'll break the head of any man that says that! Who is\nit says it? (_To_ TIM CASEY) Was it you said it? (_To_ SHAWN EARLY)\nWas it you?\n\nALL TOGETHER (_backing and shaking their heads_). It wasn't I said\nit!\n\nJACK SMITH. Tell me the name of any man that said it!\n\nALL TOGETHEB (_pointing to_ BARTLEY). It was _him_ that said\nit!\n\nJACK SMITH. Let me at him till I break his head!\n\n(BARTLEY _backs in terror. Neighbors hold_ JACK SMITH _back._)\n\nJACK SMITH (_trying to free himself_). Let me at him! Isn't he the\npleasant sort of a scarecrow for any woman to be crossing the\nocean with! It's back from the docks of New York he'd be turned\n(_trying to rush at him again_), with a lie in his mouth and\ntreachery in his heart, and another man's wife by his side, and\nhe passing her off as his own! Let me at him, can't you?\n\n(_Makes another rush, but is held back._)\n\nMAGISTRATE (_pointing to_ JACK SMITH). Policeman, put the handcuffs\non this man. I see it all now. A case of false impersonation, a\nconspiracy to defeat the ends of justice. There was a case in the\nAndaman Islands, a murderer of the Mopsa tribe, a religious\nenthusiast--\n\nPOLICEMAN. So he might be, too.\n\nMAGISTRATE. We must take both these men to the scene of the\nmurder. We must confront them with the body of the real Jack\nSmith.\n\nJACK SMITH. I'll break the head of any man that will find my dead\nbody!\n\nMAGISTRATE. I'll call more help from the barracks.\n\n(_Blows POLICEMAN'S whistle._)\n\nBARTLEY. It is what I am thinking, if myself and Jack Smith are\nput together in the one cell for the night, the handcuffs will be\ntaken off him, and his hands will be free, and murder will be\ndone that time surely!\n\nMAGISTRATE. Come on!\n\n(_They turn to the right._)\n\n                        [CURTAIN]\n\n\n\n\nTHE BEGGAR AND THE KING[1]\n\nWinthrop Parkhurst\n\n[Footnote 1: Reprinted from Drama, No. 33, February, 1919, by\npermission of Mr. Parkhurst and the editors of Drama.\nCopyrighted, 1918, as a dramatic composition, by Winthrop\nParkhurst.

The windows of the palace are open, and from a\ndistance there comes the sound of a man's voice crying for bread._\nTHE KING _sits in a golden chair. A golden crown is on his head,\nand he holds in his hand a sceptre which is also of gold. A_\nSERVANT _stands by his side, fanning him with an enormous fan of\npeacock feathers._\n\n\nTHE BEGGAR (_outside_). Bread. Bread. Bread. Give me some bread.\n\nTHE KING (_languidly_). Who is that crying in the street for bread?\n\nTHE SERVANT (_fanning_). O king, it is a beggar.\n\nTHE KING. Why does he cry for bread?\n\nTHE SERVANT. O king, he cries for bread in order that he may fill\nhis belly.\n\nTHE KING. I do not like the sound of his voice. It annoys me very\nmuch. Send him away.\n\nTHE SERVANT (_bowing_). O king, he _has_ been sent away.\n\nTHE KING. If that is so, then why do I hear his voice?\n\nTHE SERVANT. O king, he has been sent away many times, yet each\ntime that he is sent away he returns again, crying louder than he\ndid before.\n\nTHE KING. He is very unwise to annoy me on such a warm day. He\nmust be punished for his impudence. Use the lash on him.\n\nTHE SERVANT. O king, it has been done.\n\nTHE KING. Then bring out the spears.\n\nTHE SEBVANT. O king, the guards have already bloodied their\nswords many times driving him away from the palace gates. But it\nis of no avail.\n\nTHE KING. Then bind him and gag him if necessary. If need be cut\nout his tongue. I do not like the sound of the fellow's voice. It\nannoys me very much.\n\nTHE SERVANT. O king, thy orders were obeyed even yesterday.\n\nTHE KING (_frowning_). No. That cannot be. A beggar cannot cry for\nbread who has no tongue.\n\nTHE SERVANT. Behold he can--if he has grown another.\n\nTHE KING. What! Why, men are not given more than one tongue in a\nlifetime. To have more than one tongue is treason.\n\nTHE SERVANT. If it is treason to have more than one tongue, O\nking, then is this beggar surely guilty of treason.\n\nTHE KING (_pompously_). The punishment for treason is death. See to\nit that the fellow is slain. And do not fan me so languidly. I am\nvery warm.\n\nTHE SERVANT (_fanning more rapidly_). Behold, O great and\nillustrious king, all thy commands were obeyed even yesterday.\n\nTHE KING. How! Do not jest with thy king.\n\nTHE SERVANT. If I jest, then there is truth in a jest. Even\nyesterday, O king, as I have told thee, the beggar which thou now\nhearest crying aloud in the street was slain by thy soldiers with\na sword.\n\nTHE KING. Do ghosts eat bread? Forsooth, men who have been slain\nwith a sword do not go about in the streets crying for a piece of\nbread.\n\nTHE SERVANT. Forsooth, they do if they are fashioned as this\nbeggar.\n\nTHE KING. Why, he is but a man. Surely he cannot have more than\none life in a lifetime.\n\nTHE SERVANT. Listen to a tale, O king, which happened yesterday.\n\nTHE KING. I am listening.\n\nTHE SERVANT. Thy soldiers smote this beggar for crying aloud in\nthe streets for bread, but his wounds are already healed. They\ncut out his tongue, but he immediately grew another. They slew\nhim, yet he is now alive.\n\nTHE KING. Ah! that is a tale which I cannot understand at all.\n\nTHE SERVANT. O king, it may be well.\n\nTHE KING. I cannot understand what thou sayest, either.\n\nTHE SERVANT. O king, that may be well also.\n\nTHE KING. Thou art speaking now in riddles. I do not like\nriddles. They confuse my brain.\n\nTHE SERVANT. Behold, O king, if I speak in riddles it is because\na riddle has come to pass.\n\n(THE BEGGAR'S _voice suddenly cries out loudly._)\n\nTHE BEGGAR (_outside_). Bread. Bread. Give me some bread.\n\nTHE KING. Ah! He is crying out again. His voice seems to me\nlouder than it was before.\n\nTHE SERVANT. Hunger is as food to the lungs, O king.\n\nTHE KING. His lungs I will wager are well fed. Ha, ha!\n\nTHE SERVANT. But alas! his stomach is quite empty.\n\nTHE KING. That is not my business.\n\nTHE SERVANT. Should I not perhaps fling him a crust from the\nwindow?\n\nTHE KING. No! To feed a beggar is always foolish. Every crumb\nthat is given to a beggar is an evil seed from which springs\nanother fellow like him.\n\nTHE BEGGAR (_outside_). Bread. Bread. Give me some bread.\n\nTHE SERVANT. He seems very hungry, O king.\n\nTHE KING. Yes. So I should judge.\n\nTHE SERVANT. If thou wilt not let me fling, him a piece of bread\nthine ears must pay the debts of thy hand.\n\nTHE KING. A king can have no debts.\n\nTHE SERVANT. That is true, O king. Even so, the noise of this\nfellow's begging must annoy thee greatly.\n\nTHE KING. It does.\n\nTHE SERVANT. Doubtless he craves only a small crust from thy\ntable and he would be content.\n\nTHE KING. Yea, doubtless he craves only to be a king and he would\nbe very happy indeed.\n\nTHE SERVANT. Do not be hard, O king. Thou art ever wise and just.\nThis fellow is exceedingly hungry. Dost thou not command me to\nfling him just one small crust from the window?\n\nTHE KING. My commands I have already given thee. See that the\nbeggar is driven away.\n\nTHE SERVANT. But alas! O king, if he is driven away he will\nreturn again even as he did before.\n\nTHE KING. Then see to it that he is slain. I cannot be annoyed\nwith the sound of his voice.\n\nTHE SERVANT. But alas! O great and illustrious king, if he is\nslain he will come to life again even as he did before.\n\nTHE KING. Ah! that is true. But his voice troubles me. I do not\nlike to hear it.\n\nTHE SERVANT. His lungs are fattened with hunger. Of a truth they\nare quite strong.\n\nTHE KING. Well, propose a remedy to weaken them.\n\nTHE SERVANT. A remedy, O king?\n\n(_He stops fanning._)\n\nTHE KING. That is what I said. A remedy--and do not stop fanning\nme. I am exceedingly warm.\n\nTHE SERVANT (_fanning vigorously_). A crust of bread, O king,\ndropped from yonder window--forsooth that might prove a remedy.\n\nTHE KING (_angrily_). I have said I will not give him a crust of\nbread. If I gave him a crust to-day he would be just as hungry\nagain to-morrow, and my troubles would be as great as before.\n\nTHE SERVANT. That is true, O king. Thy mind is surely filled with\ngreat learning.\n\nTHE KING. Therefore, some other remedy must be found.\n\nTHE SERVANT. O king, the words of thy illustrious mouth are as\nvery meat-balls of wisdom.\n\nTHE KING (_musing_). Now let me consider. Thou sayest he does not\nsuffer pain--\n\nTHE SERVANT. Therefore he cannot be tortured.\n\nTHE KING. And he will not die--\n\nTHE SERVANT. Therefore it is useless to kill him.\n\nTHE KING. Now let me consider. I must think of some other way.\n\nTHE SERVANT. Perhaps a small crust of bread, O king--\n\nTHE KING. Ha! I have it. I have it. I myself will order him to\nstop.\n\nTHE SERVANT (_horrified_). O king!\n\nTHE KING. Send the beggar here.\n\nTHE SERVANT. O king!\n\nTHE KING. Ha! I rather fancy the fellow will stop his noise when\nthe king commands him to. Ha, ha, ha!\n\nTHE SERVANT. O king, thou wilt not have a beggar brought into thy\nroyal chamber!\n\nTHE KING (_pleased with his idea_). Yea. Go outside and tell this\nfellow that the king desires his presence.\n\nTHE SERVANT. O great and illustrious king, thou wilt surely not\ndo this thing. Thou wilt surely not soil thy royal eyes by\nlooking on such a filthy creature. Thou wilt surely not\ncontaminate thy lips by speaking to a common beggar who cries\naloud in the streets for bread.\n\nTHE KING. My ears have been soiled too much already. Therefore go\nnow and do as I have commanded thee.\n\nTHE SERVANT. O great and illustrious king, thou wilt surely not--\n\nTHE KING (_roaring at him_). I said, Go! (THE SERVANT, _abashed,\ngoes out._) Forsooth, I fancy the fellow will stop his bawling\nwhen I order him to. Forsooth, I fancy he will be pretty well\nfrightened when he hears that the king desires his presence. Ha,\nha, ha, ha!\n\nTHE SERVANT (_returning_). O king, here is the beggar.\n\n(_A shambling creature hung in filthy rags follows_ THE SERVANT\n_slowly into the royal chamber._)\n\nTHE KING. Ha! A magnificent sight, to be sure. Art thou the\nbeggar who has been crying aloud in the streets for bread?\n\nTHE BEGGAR (_in a faint voice, after a slight pause_). Art thou the\nking?\n\nTHE KING. I am the king.\n\nTHE SERVANT (_aside to_ THE BEGGAR). It is not proper for a beggar\nto ask a question of a king. Speak only as thou art spoken to.\n\nTHE KING (_to_ THE SERVANT). Do thou likewise. (_To_ THE BEGGAR) I\nhave ordered thee here to speak to thee concerning a very grave\nmatter. Thou art the beggar, I understand, who often cries aloud\nin the streets for bread. Now, the complaint of thy voice annoys\nme greatly. Therefore, do not beg any more.\n\nTHE BEGGAR (_faintly_). I--I do not understand.\n\nTHE KING. I said, do not beg any more.\n\nTHE BEGGAR. I--I do not understand.\n\nTHE SERVANT (_aside to_ THE BEGGAR). The king has commanded thee\nnot to beg for bread any more. The noise of thy voice is as\ngarbage in his ears.\n\nTHE KING (_to_ THE SERVANT). Ha! An excellent flower of speech. Pin\nit in thy buttonhole. (_To_ THE BEGGAR) Thine ears, I see, are in\nneed of a bath even more than thy body. I said, _Do not beg any\nmore._\n\nTHE BEGGAR. I--I do not understand.\n\nTHE KING (_making a trumpet of his hands and shouting_). _DO NOT\nBEG ANY MORE._\n\nTHE BEGGAR. I--I do not understand.\n\nTHE KING. Heavens! He is deafer than a stone wall.\n\nTHE SERVANT. O king, he cannot be deaf, for he understood me\nquite easily when I spoke to him in the street.\n\nTHE KING (_to_ THE BEGGAR). Art thou deaf? Canst thou hear what I\nam saying to thee now?\n\nTHE BEGGAR. Alas! I can hear every word perfectly.\n\nTHE KING. Fft! The impudence. Thy tongue shall be cut out for\nthis.\n\nTHE SERVANT. O king, to cut out his tongue is useless, for he\nwill grow another.\n\nTHE KING. No matter. It shall be cut out anyway. (_To_ THE BEGGAR)\nI have ordered thee not to beg any more in the streets. What\nmeanest thou by saying thou dost not understand?\n\nTHE BEGGAR. The words of thy mouth I can hear perfectly. But\ntheir noise is only a foolish tinkling in my ears.\n\nTHE KING. Fft! Only a--! A lash will tinkle thy hide for thee if\nthou dost not cure thy tongue of impudence. I, thy king, have\nordered thee not to beg any more in the streets for bread.\nSignify, therefore, that thou wilt obey the orders of thy king by\nquickly touching thy forehead thrice to the floor.\n\nTHE BEGGAR. That is impossible.\n\nTHE SERVANT (_aside to_ THE BEGGAR). Come. It is not safe to tempt\nthe patience of the king too long. His patience is truly great,\nbut he loses it most wondrous quickly.\n\nTHE KING. Come, now: I have ordered thee to touch thy forehead to\nthe floor.\n\nTHE SERVANT (_nudging him_). And quickly.\n\nTHE BEGGAR. Wherefore should I touch my forehead to the floor?\n\nTHE KING. In order to seal thy promise to thy king.\n\nTHE BEGGAR. But I have made no promise. Neither have I any king.\n\nTHE KING. Ho! He has made no promise. Neither has he any king.\nHa, ha, ha. I have commanded thee not to beg any more, for the\nsound of thy voice is grievous unto my ears. Touch thy forehead\nnow to the floor, as I have commanded thee, and thou shall go\nfrom this palace a free man. Refuse, and thou wilt be sorry\nbefore an hour that thy father ever came within twenty paces of\nthy mother.\n\nTHE BEGGAR. I have ever lamented that he did. For to be born into\nthis world a beggar is a more unhappy thing than any that I\nknow--unless it is to be born a king.\n\nTHE KING. Fft! Thy tongue of a truth is too lively for thy\nhealth. Come, now, touch thy forehead thrice to the floor and\npromise solemnly that thou wilt never beg in the streets again.\nAnd hurry!\n\nTHE SERVANT (_aside_). It is wise to do as thy king commands thee.\nHis patience is near an end.\n\nTHE KING. Do not be afraid to soil the floor with thy forehead. I\nwill graciously forgive thee for that.\n\n(THE BEGGAR _stands motionless._)\n\nTHE SERVANT. I said, it is not wise to keep the king waiting.\n\n(THE BEGGAR _does not move._)\n\nTHE KING. Well? (_A pause._) _Well?_ (_In a rage_) _WELL?_\n\nTHE BEGGAR. O king, thou hast commanded me not to beg in the\nstreets for bread, for the noise of my voice offends thee. Now\ntherefore do I likewise command thee to remove thy crown from thy\nforehead and throw it from yonder window into the street. For\nwhen thou hast thrown thy crown into the street, then will I no\nlonger be obliged to beg.\n\nTHE KING. Fft! _Thou_ commandest _me!_ _Thou_, a\nbeggar from the streets, commandest _me_, a king, to remove\nmy crown from my forehead and throw it from yonder window into\nthe street!\n\nTHE BEGGAR. That is what I said.\n\nTHE KING. Why, dost thou not know I can have thee slain for such\nwords?\n\nTHE BEGGAR. No. Thou canst not have me slain. The spears of thy\nsoldiers are as straws against my body.\n\nTHE KING. Ha! We shall see if they are. We shall see!\n\nTHE SERVANT. O king, it is indeed true. It is even as he has told\nthee.\n\nTHE BEGGAR. I have required thee to remove thy crown from thy\nforehead. If so be thou wilt throw it from yonder window into the\nstreet, my voice will cease to annoy thee any more. But if thou\nrefuse, then thou wilt wish thou hadst never had any crown at\nall. For thy days will be filled with a terrible boding and thy\nnights will be full of horrors, even as a ship is full of rats.\n\nTHE KING. Why, this is insolence. This is treason!\n\nTHE BEGGAR. Wilt thou throw thy crown from yonder window?\n\nTHE KING. Why, this is high treason!\n\nTHE BEGGAR. I ask thee, wilt thou throw thy crown from yonder\nwindow?\n\nTHE SERVANT (_aside to_ THE KING). Perhaps it were wise to humor\nhim, O king. After thou hast thrown thy crown away I can go\noutside and bring it to thee again.\n\nTHE BEGGAR. Well? Well? (_He points to the window._) Well?\n\nTHE KING. No! I will not throw my crown from that window--no, nor\nfrom any other window. What! Shall I obey the orders of a beggar?\nNever!\n\nTHE BEGGAR (_preparing to leave_). Truly, that is spoken like a\nking. Thou art a king, so thou wouldst prefer to lose thy head\nthan that silly circle of gold that so foolishly sits upon it.\nBut it is well. Thou art a king. Thou couldst not prefer\notherwise. (_He walks calmly toward the door._)\n\nTHE KING (_to_ THE SERVANT). Stop him! Seize him! Does he think to\nget off so easily with his impudence!\n\nTHE BEGGAR (_coolly_). One of thy servants cannot stop me. Neither\ncan ten thousand of them do me any harm. I am stronger than a\nmountain. I am stronger than the sea!\n\nTHE KING. Ha! We will see about that, we will see about that. (_To_\nTHE SERVANT) Hold him, I say. Call the guards. He shall be put in\nchains.\n\nTHE BEGGAR. My strength is greater than a mountain and my words\nare more fearful than a hurricane. This servant of thine cannot\neven touch me. With one breath of my mouth I can blow over this\nwhole palace.\n\nTHE KING. Dost thou hear the impudence he is offering me? Why\ndost thou not seize him? What is the matter with thee? Why dost\nthou not call the guards?\n\nTHE BEGGAR. I will not harm thee now. I will only cry aloud in\nthe streets for bread wherewith to fill my belly. But one day I\nwill not be so kind to thee. On that day my mouth will be filled\nwith a rushing wind and my arms will become as strong as steel\nrods, and I will blow over this palace, and all the bones in thy\nfoolish body I will snap between my fingers. I will beat upon a\nlarge drum and thy head will be my drumstick. I will not do these\nthings now. But one day I will do them. Therefore, when my voice\nsounds again in thine ears, begging for bread, remember what I\nhave told thee. Remember, O king, and be afraid!\n\n(_He walks out. THE SERVANT, struck dumb, stares after him. THE\nKING sits in his chair, dazed._)\n\nTHE KING (_suddenly collecting his wits_). After him! After him! He\nmust not be allowed to escape! After him!\n\nTHE SERVANT (_faltering_). O king--I cannot seem to move.\n\nTHE KING. Quick, then. Call the guards. He must be caught and put\nin chains. Quick, I say. Call the guards!\n\nTHE SERVANT. O king--I cannot seem to call them.\n\nTHE KING. How! Art thou dumb? Ah!\n\n(THE BEGGAR'S _voice is heard outside._)\n\nTHE BEGGAR. Bread. Bread. Give me some bread.\n\nTHE KING. Ah. (_He turns toward the window, half-frightened, and\nthen, almost instinctively, raises his hands toward his crown,\nand seems on the point of tossing it out the window. But with an\noath he replaces it and presses it firmly on his head._) How! Am I\nafraid of a beggar!\n\nTHE BEGGAR (_continuing outside_). Bread. Bread. Give me some\nbread.\n\nTHE KING (_with terrible anger_). Close that window!\n\n(THE SERVANT _stands stupent, and the voice of THE BEGGAR grows\nlouder as the curtain falls._)\n\n\n\n\nTIDES[1]\n\nGeorge Middleton\n\n[Footnote 1: Reprinted by permission of the author and of Messrs.\nHenry Holt and Company, the publishers, from the volume, _Masks\nand Other One-Act Plays_ (1920).]\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nWILLIAM WHITE, a famous Internationalist\nHILDA, his wife\nWALLACE, their son\n\nSCENE: _At the Whites'; spring, 1917. A simply furnished study.\nThe walls are lined with bookshelves, indicating, by their\nimprovised quality, that they have been increased as occasion\ndemanded. On these are stacked, in addition to the books\nthemselves, many files of papers, magazines, and \"reports.\" The\nlarge work-table, upon which rests a double student lamp and a\ntelephone, is conspicuous. A leather couch with pillows is\nopposite, pointing toward a doorway which leads into the\nliving-room. There is also a doorway in back, which apparently\nopens on the hallway beyond. The room is comfortable in spite of\nits general disorder: it is essentially the workshop of a busy\nman of public affairs. The strong sunlight of a spring day comes\nin through the window, flooding the table._\n\nWILLIAM WHITE _is standing by the window, smoking a pipe. He is\nabout fifty, of striking appearance: the visual incarnation of\nthe popular conception of a leader of men. There is authority and\nstrength in the lines of his face; his whole personality is\ncommanding; his voice has all the modulations of a well-trained\norator; his gestures are sweeping--for, even in private\nconversation, he is habitually conscious of an audience.\nOtherwise, he is simple and engaging, with some indication of his\nhumble origin._\n\n_On the sofa opposite, with a letter in her hand,_ HILDA WHITE, _his\nwife, is seated. She is somewhat younger in fact, though in\nappearance she is as one who has been worn a bit by the struggle\nof many years. Her manner contrasts with her husband's: her\ninheritance of delicate refinement is ever present in her soft\nvoice and gentle gesture. Yet she, too, suggests strength--the\nsort which will endure all for a fixed intention._\n\n_It is obvious throughout that she and her husband have been happy\ncomrades in their life together, and that a deep fundamental bond\nhas united them in spite of the different social spheres from\nwhich each has sprung._\n\n\nWHITE (_seeing she has paused_). Go on, dear; go on. Let's hear all\nof it.\n\nHILDA. Oh, what's the use, Will? You know how differently he\nfeels about the war.\n\nWHITE (_with quiet sarcasm_). But it's been so many years since\nyour respectable brother has honored me even with the slightest\nallusion--\n\nHILDA. If you care for what he says--(_continuing to read the\nletter_)--\"Remember, Hilda, you are an American. I don't suppose\nyour husband considers that an honor; but I do.\"\n\nWHITE (_interrupting_). And what kind of an American has he been in\ntimes of peace? He's wrung forty per cent profit out of his\nfactory and fought every effort of the workers to organize. Ah,\nthese smug hypocrites!\n\nHILDA (_reading_). \"His violent opposition to America going in has\nbeen disgrace enough--\"\n\nWHITE. But his war profits were all right. Oh, yes.\n\nHILDA. Let me finish, dear, since you want it. (_Reading_) \"--been\ndisgrace enough. But now that we're in, I'm writing in the faint\nhope, if you are not too much under his influence, that you will\npersuade him to keep his mouth shut. This country will tolerate\nno difference of opinion now. You radicals had better get on\nboard the band wagon. It's prison or acceptance.\" (_She stops\nreading._) He's right, dear. There will be nothing more\nintolerant than a so-called democracy at war.\n\nWHITE. By God! It's superb! Silence for twenty years and now he\nwrites his poor misguided sister for fear she will be further\ndisgraced by her radical husband.\n\nHILDA. We mustn't descend to his bitterness.\n\nWHITE. No: I suppose I should resuscitate the forgotten doctrine\nof forgiving my enemies.\n\nHILDA. He's not your enemy; he merely looks at it all\ndifferently.\n\nWHITE. I was thinking of his calm contempt for me these twenty\nyears--ever since you married me--\"out of your class,\" as he\ncalled it.\n\nHILDA. Oh, hush, Will. I've been so happy with you I can bear him\nno ill will. Besides, doesn't his attitude seem natural? You\nmustn't forget that no man in this country has fought his class\nmore than you. That hurts--especially coming from an _acquired_\nrelative.\n\nWHITE. Yes; that aggravates the offense. And I'll tell you\nsomething you may not know. (_Bitterly_) Whenever I've spoken\nagainst privilege and wealth it's been his pudgy, comfortable\nface I've shaken my fist at. He's been so damned comfortable all\nhis life.\n\nHILDA. (_She looks at him in surprise._) Why, Will, you surely\ndon't envy him his comfort, do you? I can't make you out. What's\ncome over you these last weeks? You've always been above such\npersonal bitterness; even when you were most condemned and\nridiculed. If it were anybody but you I'd think you had done\nsomething you were ashamed of.\n\nWHITE. What do you mean?\n\nHILDA. Haven't you sometimes noticed that is what bitterness to\nanother means: a failure within oneself? (_He goes over to chair\nand sits without answering._) I can think of you beaten by outside\nthings--that sort of failure we all meet; but somehow I can never\nthink of you failing yourself. You've been so brave and\nself-reliant: you've fought so hard for the truth.\n\nWHITE (_tapping letter_). But he thinks he knows the truth, too.\n\nHILDA. He's also an intense nature.\n\nWHITE (_thoughtfully after a pause_). Yet there is _some_\ntruth in what he says.\n\nHILDA (_smiling_). But you didn't like it--coming from him?\n\nWHITE. It will be different with you and me now that America's\ngone in.\n\nHILDA. Yes. It will be harder for us here; for hate is always\nfarthest from the trenches. But you and I are not the sort who\nwould compromise to escape the persecution which is the resource\nof the non-combatant.\n\n(_The phone rings: he looks at his watch._)\n\nWHITE. That's for me.\n\nHILDA. Let me. (_She goes._) It may be Wallace. (_At phone_) Yes:\nthis is 116 Chelsea. Long Distance? (_He starts as she says to\nhim_) It must be our boy. (_At phone_) Who? Oh--Mr. William White?\nYes: he'll be here. (_She hangs up receiver._) She'll ring when she\ngets the connection through.\n\nWHITE (_turning away_). It takes so long these days.\n\nHILDA. Funny he didn't ask for me.\n\nWHITE. What made you think it was Wallace?\n\nHILDA. I took it for granted. He must be having a hard time at\ncollege with all the boys full of war fever.\n\nWHITE. And a father with my record.\n\nHILDA. He should be proud of the example. He has more than other\nboys to cling to these days when everybody is losing his head as\nthe band plays and the flag is waved. He won't be carried away by\nit. He'll remember all we taught him. Ah, Will, when I think we\nnow have conscription--as they have in Germany--I thank God every\nnight our boy is too young for the draft.\n\nWHITE. But when his time comes what will he do?\n\nHILDA (_calmly_). He will do it with courage.\n\nWHITE (_referring to her brother's letter_). Either prison or\nacceptance!\n\nHILDA. I would rather have my son in prison than have him do what\nhe felt was wrong. Wouldn't you?\n\nWHITE (_evasively_). We won't have to face that problem for two\nyears.\n\nHILDA. And when it comes--if he falters--I'll give him these\nnotes of that wonderful speech you made at the International\nConference in 1910. (_Picking it up_) I was looking through it only\nthis morning.\n\nWHITE (_troubled_). Oh, that speech.\n\nHILDA (_glancing through it with enthusiasm_). \"All wars are\nimperialistic in origin. Do away with overseas investments, trade\nroutes, private control of ammunition factories, secret\ndiplomacy--\"\n\nWHITE. Don't you see that's all dead wood?\n\nHILDA (_not heeding him_). This part gave me new strength when I\nthought of Wallace. (_Reading with eloquence_) \"War will stop when\nyoung men put Internationalism above Nationality, the law of God\nabove the dictates of statesmen, the law of love above the law of\nhate, the law of self-sacrifice above the law of profit. There\nmust be no boundaries in man's thought. Let the young men of the\nworld once throw down their arms, let them once refuse to point\ntheir guns at human hearts, and all the boundaries of the world\nwill melt away and peace will find a resting-place in the hearts\nof men!\"\n\nWHITE (_taking it from her_). And I made you believe it! What silly\nprophets we radicals were. (_He tears it up._) Mere scraps of\npaper, dear; scraps of paper, now.\n\nHILDA. But it was the truth; it still is the truth.\n\nWHITE. Hilda, there's something I want to talk over very, very\nseriously with you. I've been putting it off.\n\nHILDA. Yes, dear? (_The outer door is heard to bang._) Listen:\nwasn't that the front door?\n\nWHITE. Perhaps it's the maid?\n\nHILDA (_a bit nervously_). No: she's upstairs. No one rang. Please\nsee.\n\nWHITE (_smiling_). Now don't worry! It can't possibly be the Secret\nService.\n\nHILDA. One never knows in war times what to expect. I sometimes\nfeel I am in a foreign country.\n\n(WHITE _goes slowly to the door in back and opens it._ WALLACE,\n_their son, with valise in hand, is standing there, as if he had\nhesitated to enter._\n\n_He is a fine clean-cut young fellow, with his father's physical\nendowment and his mother's spiritual intensity. The essential\nnote he strikes is that of honesty. It is apparent he is under\nthe pressure of a momentous decision which has brought him\nunexpectedly home from college._)\n\nWHITE. Wallace!\n\nWALLACE (_shaking hands_). Hello, Dad!\n\nHILDA. Wallace! My boy!\n\n(WALLACE _drops valise and goes to his mother's arms._)\n\nWALLACE (_with deep feeling_). Mother!\n\nWHITE (_after a pause_). Well, boy; this is unexpected. We were\njust talking of you.\n\nWALLACE. Were you?\n\nHILDA. I'm so glad to see you, so glad.\n\nWALLACE. Yes--yes--but--\n\nWHITE. There's nothing the matter?\n\nHILDA. You've had trouble at college?\n\nWALLACE. Not exactly. But I couldn't stand it there. I've\nleft--for good.\n\nWHITE. I was sure that would happen.\n\nHILDA. Tell us. You know we'll understand.\n\nWALLACE. Dad, if you don't mind, I'd like to talk it over with\nmother first.\n\nWHITE. Of course, old fellow, that's right. She'll stand by you\njust as she's always stood by me--all these years. (_He kisses\nher._) I--I--\n\n(_He smooths her hair gently, looking into her eyes as she smiles\nup at him._)\n\nWe mustn't let this war hurt all we've had together--you and I--\n\nHILDA (_smiling and turning towards her son_). And Wallace.\n\nWHITE. And Wallace. Yes. (WALLACE _looks away guiltily._) Let me\nknow when the phone comes.\n\n(_He goes out hastily. She closes the door after him and then\ncomes to WALLACE, who has sat down, indicating he is troubled._)\n\nHILDA. They made it hard for you at college?\n\nWALLACE. I don't know how to tell you.\n\nHILDA. I understand. The flag waving, the patriotic speeches, the\nbillboards advertising the glory of war, the call of adventure\noffered to youth, the pressure of your friends--all made it hard\nfor you to be called a slacker.\n\nWALLACE, No, mother. I wasn't afraid of what they could call me.\nThat was easy.\n\nHILDA (_proudly_). You are your father's son!\n\nWALLACE. Mother, I can't stand the thought of killing, you know\nthat. And I couldn't forget all you've told me. That's why I've\nhad to think this out all these months alone; why I've hesitated\nlonger than most fellows. The only thing I was really afraid of\nwas being wrong. But now I know I'm right and I'm going clean\nthrough to the limit.\n\nHILDA. As your father said, I 'll stand by you--whatever it\nis--if only you feel it's right.\n\nWALLACE. Will you? Will you, mother? No matter what happens? (_She\nnods._) I knew you would. (_Taking her hand_) Then, mother, listen.\nI've volunteered.\n\nHILDA (_shocked_). Volunteered!\n\nWALLACE. Yes. I leave for training-camp to-night.\n\nHILDA. To-night?\n\nWALLACE. Yes, mother. Once I made up my mind, I couldn't wait to\nbe drafted. I wanted to offer myself. I didn't want to be made to\ngo.\n\nHILDA (_hardly grasping it_). But you are too young.\n\nWALLACE. I lied about my age. You and father can stop me if you\ntell the truth. That's why I've come back. I want you to promise\nyou won't tell.\n\nHILDA. _You_ ask me to aid you in what I don't believe?\nWALLACE. But you said you'd stick by me if _I_ thought it\nwas right.\n\nHILDA. But--\n\nWALLACE (_with fervor_). And I tell you, mother, I do feel it was\nright for America to go in. I see now we ought to have declared\nwar when they crushed Belgium. Yes; we ought to have gone in when\nthe Lusitania was sunk. But we've been patient. The President\ntried to keep us out of it until we _had_ to go in to save\nour self-respect. We had to go in to show we were men of honor,\nnot pussy-cats. We had to go in to show the world the Stars and\nStripes wasn't a dish-rag on which the Germans could dry their\nbloody hands!\n\nHILDA (_gazing at him incredulously_). You hate them as much as\nthat?\n\nWALLACE. Hate? No, mother, no. (_As if questioning himself_) I\nreally haven't any hate for the German _people_. People are\njust people everywhere, I suppose, and they're tricked and fooled\nby their rotten government, as the President says.\n\nHILDA. Then why fight them?\n\nWALLACE. Because they're standing back of their government, doing\nwhat it says. And they've got to be licked to show them what kind\nof a government they have.\n\nHILDA. At least you have no hate in your heart--that's something.\n\nWALLACE. Oh, yes, I have, mother. But it isn't for the poor\ndevils I've got to shoot. It's for the stay-at-home fellow here\nin America who sits in a comfortable armchair, who applauds\npatriotic sentiment, cheers the flag, and does nothing for his\ncountry but hate and hate--while we fight for him. That's the\nfellow I'll hate all right when I sit in the trenches. And that's\nwhy I couldn't look myself in the face if I stayed out a day\nlonger; why I've got to go in; why I'm going to die if I must,\nbecause _everybody_ ought to be willing to die for what he\nbelieves.\n\nHILDA. You are my son, _too_! For I would willingly have\ndied if it could have kept us out of this war.\n\nWALLACE. Yes. I am your son, too. And that's why you wouldn't\nrespect me if I didn't go through.\n\nHILDA. No. I wouldn't have respected you. But--but--(_She breaks\na bit, then controls herself._) You are quite sure you're doing\nwhat's right?\n\nWALLACE (_tenderly_). Would I have been willing to hurt you like\nthis?\n\nHILDA (_holding him close to her_). My boy; my boy!\n\nWALLACE. It'll be all right, mother.\n\nHILDA. Ah, yes. It will be all right. Nothing matters in time:\nit's only the moments that hurt.\n\nWALLACE (_after a pause_). Then you won't tell my real age, or\ninterfere?\n\nHILDA. I respect your right to decide your own life.\n\nWALLACE (_joyed_). Mother!\n\nHILDA. I respect your dedication; your willingness to sacrifice\nfor your beliefs. Why, Wallace, it would be a crime for me to\nstand in your way--even with my mother's love. (_He kisses her._)\nDo it all as cleanly as you can. I'll hope and pray that you'll\ncome back to me. (_Half breaking down and taking him in her arms_).\nOh, my boy; my boy. Let me hold you. You'll never know how hard\nit is for a mother.\n\nWALLACE (_gently_). But other mothers send their boys.\n\nHILDA. Most of them believe in what their sons are fighting for.\nMothers have got to believe in it; or else how could they stand\nthe thought of bayonets stuck into the bodies they brought forth\nin their own blood? (_There is a pause till she controls herself._)\nI'll help you get your things together.\n\nWALLACE. And father?\n\nHILDA. He will be angry.\n\nWALLACE. But you will make him understand?\n\nHILDA. I'll try. Yet you must be patient with him if he doesn't\nunderstand. Don't ever forget his long fight against all kinds of\nPrussianism when you hear him reviled by those who have always\nhated his radicalism and who, now, under the guise of patriotism,\nare trying to render him useless for further attacks on them\nafter the war. He's been persecuted so by them--even back in the\ndays when our press was praising Germany and our distinguished\ncitizens were dining at the Emperor's table. Don't forget all\nthis, my boy. These days are hard for him--and me--harder perhaps\nthan for you who go out to die in glory and praise. There are no\nflags for us, no music that stirs, no applause; but we too suffer\nin silence for what we believe. And it is only the strongest who\ncan survive.--Now call your father.\n\nWALLACE (_goes to door_). Dad! (_He leaves door open and turns to\nhis mother._) I'll be getting my things together. (_There is a\npause._ WHITE _enters._) Dad, mother has something to ask you. (_He\nlooks from father to mother._) Thanks, little mother.\n\n(_He kisses her and goes out, taking the valise. His father and\nmother stand facing each other._)\n\nHILDA. Wallace has volunteered. (_He looks at her keenly._) He has\nlied about his age. He wants us to let him go.\n\nWHITE. Volunteered?\n\nHILDA. Yes; he leaves to-night.\n\nWHITE (_after a pause_). And what have you told him?\n\nHILDA. That he must go.\n\nWHITE. You can say that?\n\nHILDA. It is the way he sees it.\n\nWHITE (_going to her sympathetically_). Hilda.\n\nHILDA (_looking up at him tenderly_). O Will, do you remember when\nhe was born? (_He soothes her._) And all we nursed him through\nafterwards; and all we taught him; all we tried to show him about\nwar. (_With a shrug of her shoulders_) None of it has mattered.\n\nWHITE. War is stronger than all that.\n\nHILDA. So we mustn't blame him. You won't blame him?\n\nWHITE. He fears I will?\n\nHILDA. He has always feared you a little, though he loves you\ndeeply. You mustn't oppose him, dear. You won't?\n\nWHITE (_wearily_). Is there any use opposing anybody or anything\nthese days?\n\nHILDA. We must wait till the storm passes.\n\nWHITE. That's never been my way.\n\nHILDA. No. You've fought all your life. But now we must sit\nsilent together and wait; wait for our boy to come back. Will,\nthink of it; we are going to have a boy \"over there,\" too.\n\nWHITE. Hilda, hasn't it ever struck you that we may have been all\nwrong? (_She looks at him, as she holds his hand._) What could\nthese frail hands do? How could we poor little King Canutes halt\nthis tide that has swept over the world? Isn't it better, after\nall, that men should fight themselves out; bring such desolation\nupon themselves that they will be forced to see the futility of\nwar? May it not become so terrible that men--the workers, I\nmean--will throw down their worn-out weapons of their own accord?\nWon't permanent peace come through bitter experience rather than\ntalk--talk--talk?\n\nHILDA (_touching the torn pages of his speech and smiling_). Here\nis your answer to your own question.\n\nWHITE. Oh, that was all theory. We're in now. You say yourself we\ncan't oppose it. Isn't it better if we try to direct the current\nto our own ends rather than sink by trying to swim against it?\n\nHILDA. Oh, yes; it would be easier for one who _could_\ncompromise.\n\nWHITE. But haven't we radicals been too intolerant of compromise?\n\nHILDA. That has been _your_ strength. And it is your\nstrength I'm relying on now that Wallace--Shall I call him?\n\nWHITE (_significantly_). No; wait.\n\nHILDA (_apprehensive at his turn_). Oh, yes. Before he came you\nsaid there was something--(_The phone rings. They both look at\nit._) That's for you.\n\nWHITE (_not moving_). Yes.\n\nHILDA _hardly believing his attititde_). Is--is it private?\n\nWHITE. No. Perhaps it will be easier this way. (_He hesitates,\nthen goes to phone as she stands expectant._) Yes. Yes. Long\nDistance? Washington? (_Her lips repeat the word._) Yes. This is\nWilliam White. Hello. Yes. Is this the Secretary speaking? Oh, I\nappreciate the honor of having you confirm it personally. Senator\nBough is chairman? At his request? Ah, yes; war makes strange\nbedfellows. Yes. The passport and credentials? Oh, I'll be ready.\nYes. Good-bye.\n\n(_He hangs up the receiver and looks at her._)\n\nHILDA. You, too!\n\nWHITE. I've been trying to tell you these last weeks; but I\ncouldn't somehow.\n\nHILDA. You were ashamed?\n\nWHITE. No, dear; only I knew it would hurt you.\n\nHILDA. I'm not thinking of myself but of you. You are going to be\npart of this war?\n\nWHITE. I'm going to do what I can to help finish it.\n\nHILDA. By compromising with the beliefs of a lifetime?\n\nWHITE. No, dear; not that. I've accepted the appointment on this\ncommission because I'm going to accept facts.\n\nHILDA. Have the facts of war changed, or is it you?\n\nWHITE. Neither has changed; but I'm going to act differently. I'm\ngoing to be part of it. Yes. I'm going to help direct the\ncurrent.\n\nHILDA. I can't believe what I am hearing. Is it you, William\nWhite, speaking? You who, for twenty years, have stood against\nall war!\n\nWHITE. Yes.\n\nHILDA. And now, when the test comes, you are going to lend\nyourself to it! You of all men!\n\nWHITE. Hilda, dear; I didn't expect you to accept it easily; but\nI think I can make you see if you will let me.\n\nHILDA (_poignantly_). If I will let you! Why, Will, I must\nunderstand; I must.\n\nWHITE. Perhaps it will be difficult at first--with your\nstandards.\n\nHILDA. But my standards were yours, Will. You gave them to me.\nYou taught me. You took a young girl who loved you. You showed\nher the truth, and she followed you and has followed you gladly\nthrough hard years of struggle and poverty because of those\nideals. And now you talk of my standards! Will, don't you see, I\nmust understand?\n\nWHITE. Dear, standards are relative things; they differ with\ncircumstance.\n\nHILDA. Have your ideals only been old clothes you change to suit\nthe weather?\n\nWHITE. It's the end we must keep in mind. I haven't changed or\ncompromised one bit in that. I'm working in changed conditions,\nthat's all; working with all my heart to do away with all war.\n\nHILDA. By fighting one?\n\nWHITE (_with eloquence_). Yes. Because it is necessary. I've come\nto see we can't argue war out of the world with words. We've got\nto beat it out of the world. It can't be done with our hands\nlifted up in prayer; it can only be done with iron hands crushing\nit down. War is the mood of the world. Well, I'm going to fight\nin my fashion. And when it is over, I'm going to keep on\nfighting; for the next war will be greater than this. It will be\neconomic revolution. It will be the war of capital and labor. And\nI mean to be ready.\n\nHILDA (_listening incredulously_). And to get ready you are willing\nto link arms now with Senator Bough--a man you once called the\nlackey of Wall Street--a man who has always opposed every\ndemocratic principle.\n\nWHITE. Yes. Don't you see the Government is beginning to realize\nit can't do without us? Don't you see my appointment is an\nacknowledgment of the rising tide of radicalism in the world?\nDon't you see, with the prestige that will come to me from this\nappointment, I will have greater power after the war; power to\nbring about the realization of all our dreams; power to\ndemand--even at the Peace table itself, perhaps--that all wars\nmust end?\n\nHILDA. Do you actually believe you will have any power with your\n_own_ people when you have compromised them for a temporary\nexpediency?\n\nWHITE (_with a gesture_). The leader must be wiser than the people\nwho follow.\n\nHILDA. So, contempt for your people is the first thing your new\npower has brought you! (_He makes a gesture of denial._) You feel\nyou are above them--not of them. Do you believe for a moment that\nSenator Bough has anything but contempt for you, too?\n\nWHITE (_confidently_). He needs me.\n\nHILDA. Needs you? Don't you understand why he had you appointed\non that committee? He wanted to get you out of the way.\n\nWHITE. Isn't that an acknowledgment of my power?\n\nHILDA. Yes. You're a great asset now. You're a \"reformed\"\nradical. Why, Will, he'll use you in the capitals of Europe to\nadvertise his liberalism; just as the prohibitionist exhibits a\nreformed drunkard.\n\nWHITE. And I tell you, Hilda, after the war I shall be stronger\nthan he is, stronger than any of them.\n\nHILDA. No man is strong unless he does what he feels is right.\nNo, no, Will; you've convicted yourself with your own eloquence.\nYou've wanted to do this for some reason. But it isn't the one\nyou've told me. No; no.\n\nWHITE (_angrily_). You doubt my sincerity?\n\nHILDA. No; only the way you have read yourself.\n\nWHITE. Well, if you think I've tried to make it easy for myself\nyou are mistaken. Is it easy to pull out of the rut and habit of\nyears? Easy to know my friends will jeer and say I've sold out?\nEasy to have you misunderstand? (_Goes to her._) Hilda, I'm doing\nthis for their good. I'm doing it--just as Wallace is--because I\nfeel it's right.\n\nHILDA. No; you shouldn't say that. You are not doing this for the\nsame reason Wallace is. He believes in this war. He has accepted\nit all simply without a question. If you had seen the look in his\neyes, you would have known he was a dedicated spirit; there was\nno shadow, no doubt; it was pure flame. But you! You believe\ndifferently! You can't hush the mind that for twenty years has\nthought no war ever could henceforth be justified. You can't give\nyourself to this war without tricking yourself with phrases. You\nsee power in it and profit for yourself. (_He protests._) That's\nyour own confession. You are only doing what is expedient--not\nwhat is right. Oh, Will, don't compare your motives with those of\nour son. I sent him forth, without a word of protest, because he\nwishes to die for his own ideals: you are killing your own ideals\nfor the ideals of others! (_She turns away._) Oh, Will, that's what\nhurts. If you were only like him, I--I could stand it.\n\nWHITE (_quietly, after a pause_). I can't be angry at you--even\nwhen you say such things. You've been too much a part of my life,\nand work, and I love you, Hilda. You know that, don't you, dear?\n(_He sits beside her and takes her hand._) I knew it would be\ndifficult to make you understand. Only once have I lacked\ncourage, and that was when I felt myself being drawn into this\nand they offered me the appointment. For then I saw I must tell\nyou. You know I never have wanted to cause you pain. But when you\nasked me to let Wallace go, I thought you would understand my\ngoing, too.--Oh, perhaps our motives are different; he is young;\nwar has caught his imagination; but, I, too, see a duty, a way to\naccomplish my ideals.\n\nHILDA. Let's leave ideals out of this now. It's like bitter\nenemies praying to the same God as they kill each other.\n\nWHITE. Yes. War is full of ironies. I see that: Wallace can't.\nIt's so full of mixed motives, good and bad. Yes. I'll grant all\nthat. Only, America has gone in. The whole tide was against us,\ndear. It is sweeping over the world: a brown tide of khaki\nsweeping everything before it. All my life I've fought against\nthe current. (_Wearily_) And now that I've gone in, too, my arms\nseem less tired. Yes; and except for the pain I've caused you,\nI've never in all my life felt so--so happy.\n\n(_Then she understands. She slowly turns to him, with tenderness\nin her eyes._)\n\nHILDA. Oh, now, Will, I do understand. Now I see the real reason\nfor what you've done.\n\nWHITE (_defensively_). I've given the real reason.\n\nHILDA (_her heart going out to him_). You poor tired man. My dear\none. Forgive me if I made it difficult for you, if I said cruel\nwords. I ought to have guessed; ought to have seen what life has\ndone to you. (_He looks up, not understanding her words_). Those\nhands of yours first dug a living out of the ground. Then they\nbuilt houses and grew strong because you were a workman--a man of\nthe people. You saw injustice, and all your life you fought\nagainst those who had the power to inflict it: the press; the\ncomfortable respectables, like my brother; and even those of your\nown group who opposed you--you fought them all. And they look at\nyou as an outsider, an alien in your own country. O Will, I know\nhow hard it has been for you to be always on the defensive,\nagainst the majority. It is hard to live alone, away from the\nherd. It does tire one to the bone and make one envious of the\ncomfort and security they find by being together.\n\nWHITE. Yes--but--\n\nHILDA. Now the war comes and with it a chance to get back; to be\npart of the majority; to be welcomed with open arms by those who\nhave fought you; to go back with honor and praise. And, yes, to\nhave the warmth and comfort of the crowd. That's the real reason\nyou're going in. You're tired and worn out with the fight. I\nknow. I understand now.\n\nWHITE (_earnestly_). If I thought it was that, I'd kill myself.\n\nHILDA. There's been enough killing already. I have to understand\nit somehow to accept it at all.\n\n(_He stares at her, wondering at her words. She smiles. He goes to\na chair and sits down, gazing before him. The music of Over There\nis now heard outside in the street, approaching nearer and\nnearer. It is a military band. WALLACE excitedly rushes in\ndressed in khaki._)\n\nWALLACE. Mother, mother. The boys are coming down the street.\n(_Sees father._) Dad! Mother has told you?\n\nHILDA (_calmly_). Yes; I've told him.\n\nWALLACE. And you're going to let me go, Dad?\n\nHILDA. Yes.\n\nWALLACE. Oh, thanks, Dad (_grasping his hand_).\n\nI knew mother would make you see. (_Music nearer._) Listen! Isn't\nthat a great tune? Lifts you up on your feet and carries you over\nthere. Gee, it just gets into a fellow and makes him want to run\nfor his gun and charge over the top. (_He goes to balcony._) Look!\nThey're nearing here; all ready to sail with the morning tide.\nThey've got their helmets on. You can't see the end of them\ncoming down the avenue. Oh, thank God, I'm going to be one of\nthem soon. Thank God! I'm going to fight for Uncle Sam and the\nStars and Stripes. (_Calls off_) Hurrah! (_To them_) Oh, I wish I had\na flag. Why haven't we got a flag here?--Hurrah!!\n\n(_As he goes out on the balcony the music plays louder. HILDA has\ngone to WHITE during this, and stands behind him, with her arms\ndown his arms, as he sits there, gazing before him._)\n\nHILDA (_fervently_). Oh, Will, if I could only feel it as he does!!\n\n(_The music begins to trail off as WHITE tenderly takes hold of\nher hands._)\n\n                        [CURTAIN]\n\n\n\n\nILE\n\nEugene O'Neill\n\n\nSCENE: CAPTAIN KEENEY'S cabin on board the steam whaling ship\nAtlantic Queen--a small, square compartment, about eight feet\nhigh, with a skylight in the centre looking out on the poop deck.\nOn the left (_the stern of the ship_) a long bench with rough\ncushions is built in against the wall. In front of the bench, a\ntable. Over the bench, several curtained portholes.\n\nIn the rear, left, a door leading to the captain's\nsleeping-quarters. To the right of the door a small organ,\nlooking as if it were brand-new, is placed against the wall.\n\nOn the right, to the rear, a marble-topped, sideboard. On the\nsideboard, a woman's sewing-basket. Farther forward, a doorway\nleading to the companion way, and past the officers' quarters to\nthe main deck.\n\nIn the centre of the room, a stove. From the middle of the\nceiling a hanging lamp is suspended. The walls of the cabin are\npainted white.\n\nThere is no rolling of the ship, and the light which comes\nthrough the skylight is sickly and faint, indicating one of those\ngray days of calm when ocean and sky are alike dead. The silence\nis unbroken except for the measured tread of someone walking up\nand down on the poop deck overhead.\n\nIt is nearing two bells--one o'clock--in the afternoon of a day\nin the year 1895.\n\nAt the rise of the curtain there is a moment of intense silence.\nThen the STEWARD enters and commences to clear the table of the\nfew dishes which still remain on it after the CAPTAIN'S dinner.\nHe is an old, grizzled man dressed in dungaree pants, a sweater,\nand a woolen cap with ear-flaps. His manner is sullen and angry.\nHe stops stacking up the plates and casts a quick glance upward\nat the skylight; then tiptoes over to the closed door in rear and\nlistens with his ear pressed to the crack. What he hears makes\nhis face darken and he mutters a furious curse. There is a noise\nfrom the doorway on the right, and he darts back to the table.\n\nBEN enters. He is an over-grown, gawky boy with a long, pinched\nface. He is dressed in sweater, fur cap, etc. His teeth are\nchattering with the cold and he hurries to the stove, where he\nstands for a moment shivering, blowing on his hands, slapping\nthem against his sides, on the verge of crying.\n\nTHE STEWARD (_in relieved tones--seeing who it is_). Oh, 'tis you,\nis it? What're ye shiverin' 'bout? Stay by the stove where ye\nbelong and ye'll find no need of chatterin'.\n\nBEN. It's c-c-old. (_Trying to control his chattering\nteeth--derisively_) Who d' ye think it were--the Old Man?\n\nTHE STEWARD. (_He makes a threatening move--BEN shrinks away._)\nNone o' your lip, young un, or I'll learn ye. (_More kindly_) Where\nwas it ye've been all o' the time--the fo'c's'le?\n\nBEN. Yes.\n\nTHE STEWARD. Let the Old Man see ye up for'ard monkey-shinin'\nwith the handstand ye'll get a hidin' ye'll not forget in a\nhurry.\n\nBEN. Aw, he don't see nothin'. (_A trace of awe in his tones--he\nglances upward._) He just walks up and down like he didn't notice\nnobody--and stares at the ice to the no'th'ard.\n\nTHE STEWARD (_the same tone of awe creeping into his voice_). He's\nalways starin' at the ice. (_In a sudden rage, shaking his fist at\nthe skylight_) Ice, ice, ice! Damn him and damn the ice! Holdin'\nus in for nigh on a year--nothin' to see but ice--stuck in it\nlike a fly in molasses!\n\nBEN (_apprehensively_). Ssshh! He'll hear ye.\n\nTHE STEWARD (_raging_). Aye, damn him, and damn the Arctic seas,\nand damn this stinkin' whalin' ship of his, and damn me for a\nfool to ever ship on it! (_Subsiding, as if realizing the\nuselessness of this outburst--shaking his head--slowly, with deep\nconviction_) He's a hard man--as hard a man as ever sailed the\nseas.\n\nBEN (_solemnly_). Aye.\n\nTHE STEWARD. The two years we all signed up for are done this\nday. Blessed Christ! Two years o' this dog's life, and no luck in\nthe fishin', and the hands half starved with the food runnin'\nlow, rotten as it is; and not a sign of him turnin' back for\nhome! (_Bitterly_) Home! I begin to doubt if ever I'll set foot on\nland again. (_Excitedly_) What is it he thinks he's goin' to do?\nKeep us all up here after our time is worked out till the last\nman of us is starved to death or frozen? We've grub enough hardly\nto last out the voyage back if we started now. What are the men\ngoin' to do 'bout it? Did ye hear any talk in the fo'c's'le?\n\nBEN (_going over to him--in a half-whisper_). They said if he don't\nput back south for home to-day they're goin' to mutiny.\n\nTHE STEWARD (_with grim satisfaction_). Mutiny? Aye, 'tis the only\nthing they can do; and serve him right after the manner he's\ntreated them--'s if they weren't no better nor dogs.\n\nBEN. The ice is all broke up to s'uth'rd. They's clear water's\nfar's you can see. He ain't got no excuse for not turnin' back\nfor home, the men says.\n\nTHE STEWARD (_bitterly_). He won't look nowheres but no'th'rd where\nthey's only the ice to see. He don't want to see no clear water.\nAll he thinks on is gittin' the ile--'s if it was our fault he\nain't had good luck with the whales. (_Shaking his head_) I think\nthe man's mighty nigh losin' his senses.\n\nBEN (_awed_). D' you really think he's crazy?\n\nTHE STEWARD. Aye, it's the punishment o' God on him. Did ye hear\never of a man who wasn't crazy do the things he does? (_Pointing\nto the door in rear_) Who but a man that's mad would take his\nwoman--and as sweet a woman as ever was--on a stinkin' whalin'\nship to the Arctic seas to be locked in by the rotten ice for\nnigh on a year, and maybe lose her senses forever--for it's sure\nshe'll never be the same again.\n\nBEN (_sadly_). She useter be awful nice to me before--(_his eyes\ngrow wide and frightened_) she got--like she is.\n\nTHE STEWARD. Aye, she was good to all of us. 'T would have been\nhell on board without her; for he's a hard man--a hard, hard\nman--a driver if there ever was one. (_With a grim laugh_) I hope\nhe's satisfied now--drivin' her on till she's near lost her mind.\nAnd who could blame her? 'T is a God's wonder we're not a ship\nfull of crazed people--with the damned ice all the time, and the\nquiet so thick you're afraid to hear your own voice.\n\nBEN (_with a frightened glance toward the door on right_). She\ndon't never speak to me no more--jest looks at me's if she didn't\nknow me.\n\nTHE STEWARD. She don't know no one--but him. She talks to\nhim--when she does talk--right enough.\n\nBEN. She does nothin' all day long now but sit and sew--and then\nshe cries to herself without makin' no noise. I've seen her.\n\nTHE STEWARD. Aye, I could hear her through the door a while back.\n\nBEN (_tiptoes over to the door and listens_). She's cryin' now.\n\nTHE STEWARD (_furiously--shaking his fist_). God send his soul to\nhell for the devil he is!\n\n(_There is the noise of someone coming slowly down the\ncompanionway stairs._ THE STEWARD _hurries to his stacked-up\ndishes. He is so nervous from fright that he knocks off the top\none, which falls and breaks on the floor. He stands aghast,\ntrembling with dread. BEN is violently rubbing off the organ with\na piece of cloth which he has snatched from his pocket_, CAPTAIN\nKEENEY _appears in the doorway on right and comes into the cabin,\nremoving his fur cap as he does so. He is a man of about forty,\naround five-ten in height, but looking much shorter on account of\nthe enormous proportions of his shoulders and chest. His face is\nmassive and deeply lined, with gray-blue eyes of a bleak\nhardness, and a tightly clenched, thin-lipped mouth. His thick\nhair is long and gray. He is dressed in a heavy blue jacket and\nblue pants stuffed into his sea-boots._\n\n_He is followed into the cabin by the_ SECOND MATE, _a rangy\nsix-footer with a lean, weatherbeaten face._ The MATE _is dressed\nabout the same as the captain. He is a man of thirty or so._)\n\nKEENEY. (_Comes toward the_ STEWARD--_with a stern look on his\nface. The_ STEWARD _is visibly frightened and the stack of dishes\nrattles in his trembling hands._ KEENEY _draws back his fist and\nthe_ STEWARD _shrinks away. The fist is gradually lowered and_\nKEENEY _speaks slowly._) 'T would be like hitting a worm. It Is\nnigh on two bells, Mr. Steward, and this truck not cleared yet.\n\nTHE STEWARD (_stammering_). Y-y-yes, sir.\n\nKEENEY. Instead of doin' your rightful work ye've been below here\ngossipin' old woman's talk with that boy. (_To_ BEN _fiercely_) Get\nout o' this, you! Clean up the chartroom. (BEN _darts past the_\nMATE _to the open doorway._) Pick up that dish, Mr. Steward!\n\nTHE STEWARD (_doing so with difficulty_). Yes, sir.\n\nKEENEY. The next dish you break, Mr. Steward, you take a bath in\nthe Bering Sea at the end of a rope.\n\nTHE STEWARD (_tremblingly_). Yes, sir.\n\n(_He hurries out. The_ SECOND MATE _walks slowly over to the_\nCAPTAIN.)\n\nMATE. I warn't 'specially anxious the man at the wheel should\ncatch what I wanted to say to you, sir. That's why I asked you to\ncome below.\n\nKEENEY (_impatiently_). Speak your say, Mr. Slocum.\n\nMATE (_unconsciously lowering his voice_). I'm afeard there'll be\ntrouble with the hands by the look o' things. They'll likely turn\nugly, every blessed one o' them, if you don't put back. The two\nyears they signed up for is up to-day.\n\nKEENEY. And d'you think you're tellin' me somethin' new, Mr.\nSlocum? I've felt it in the air this long time past. D'you think\nI've not seen their ugly looks and the grudgin' way they worked?\n\n(_The door in rear is opened and_ MRS. KEENEY _stands in the\ndoorway. She is a slight, sweet-faced little woman primly dressed\nin black. Her eyes are red from weeping and her face drawn and\npale. She takes in the cabin with a frightened glance and stands\nas if fixed to the spot by some nameless dread, clasping and\nunclasping her hands nervously. The two men turn and look at\nher._)\n\nKEENEY (_with rough tenderness_). Well, Annie?\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_as if awakening from a dream_). David, I--(_She is\nsilent. The_ MATE _starts for the doorway._)\n\nKEENEY (_turning to him--sharply_). Wait!\n\nMATE. Yes, sir.\n\nKEENEY. D'you want anything, Annie?\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_after a pause, during which she seems to be\nendeavoring to collect her thoughts_). I thought maybe--I'd go up\non deck, David, to get a breath of fresh air.\n\n(_She stand's humbly awaiting his permission. He and the_ MATE\n_exchange a significant glance._)\n\nKEENEY. It's too cold, Annie. You'd best stay below to-day.\nThere's nothing to look at on deck--but ice.\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_monotonously_). I know--ice, ice, ice! But there's\nnothing to see down here but these walls.\n\n(_She makes a gesture of loathing._)\n\nKEENEY. You can play the organ, Annie.\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_dully_). I hate the organ. It puts me in mind of\nhome.\n\nKEENEY (_a touch of resentment in his voice_). I got it jest for\nyou.\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_dully_). I know. (_She turns away from them and walks\nslowly to the bench on left. She lifts up one of the curtains and\nlooks through a porthole; then utters an exclamation of joy._) Ah,\nwater! Clear water! As far as I can see! How good it looks after\nall these months of ice! (_She turns round to them, her face\ntransfigured with joy._) Ah, now I must go upon deck and look at\nit, David.\n\nKEENEY (_frowning_). Best not to-day, Annie. Best wait for a day\nwhen the sun shines.\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_desperately_). But the sun never shines in this\nterrible place.\n\nKEENEY (_a tone of command in his voice_). Best not to-day, Annie.\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_crumbling before this command--abjectly_). Very well,\nDavid.\n\n(_She stands there staring straight before her as if in a daze.\nThe two men look at her uneasily._)\n\nKEENEY (_sharply_). Annie!\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_dully_). Yes, David.\n\nKEENEY. Me and Mr. Slocum has business to talk about--ship's\nbusiness.\n\nMRS. KEENEY. Very well, David.\n\n(_She goes slowly out, rear, and leaves the door three quarters\nshut behind her._)\n\nKEENEY. Best not have her on deck if they's goin' to be any\ntrouble.\n\nMATE. Yes, sir.\n\nKEENEY. And trouble they's goin' to be. I feel it in my bones.\n\n(_Takes a revolver from the pocket of his coat and examines it._)\n\nGot yourn?\n\nMATE. Yes, sir.\n\nKEENEY. Not that we'll have to use 'em--not if I know their breed\nof dog--jest to frighten 'em up a bit. (_Grimly_) I ain't never\nbeen forced to use one yit; and trouble I've had by land and by\nsea's long as I kin remember, and will have till my dyin' day, I\nreckon.\n\nMATE (_hesitatingly_). Then you ain't goin'--to turn back?\n\nKEENEY. Turn back! Mr. Slocum, did you ever hear o' me pointin'\ns'uth for home with only a measly four hundred barrel of ile in\nthe hold?\n\nMATE (_hastily_). No, sir--but the grub's gittin' low.\n\nKEENEY. They's enough to last a long time yit, if they're careful\nwith it; and they's plenty o' water.\n\nMATE. They say it's not fit to eat--what's left; and the two\nyears they signed on fur is up to-day. They might make trouble\nfor you in the courts when we git home.\n\nKEENEY. To hell with 'em! Let them make what law trouble they\nkin. I don't give a damn 'bout the money. I've got to git the\nile! (_Glancing sharply at the_ MATE) You ain't turnin' no damned\nsea lawyer, be you, Mr. Slocum?\n\nMATE (_flushing_). Not by a hell of a sight, sir.\n\nKEENEY. What do the fools want to go home fur now? Their share o'\nthe four hundred barrel wouldn't keep 'em in chewin' terbacco.\n\nMATE (_slowly_). They wants to git back to their folks an' things,\nI s'pose.\n\nKEENEY (_looking at him searchingly_). 'N' you want to turn back,\ntoo. (THE MATE _looks down confusedly before his sharp gaze._)\nDon't lie, Mr. Slocum. It's writ down plain in your eyes. (_With\ngrim sarcasm_) I hope, Mr. Slocum, you ain't agoin' to jine the\nmen agin me.\n\nMATE (_indignantly_). That ain't fair, sir, to say sich things.\n\nKEENEY (_with satisfaction_). I warn't much afeard o' that, Tom.\nYou been with me nigh on ten year and I've learned ye whalin'. No\nman kin say I ain't a good master, if I be a hard one.\n\nMATE. I warn't thinkin' of myself, sir--'bout turnin' home, I\nmean. (_Desperately_) But Mrs. Keeney, sir--seems like she ain't\njest satisfied up here, ailin' like--what with the cold an' bad\nluck an' the ice an' all.\n\nKEENEY (_his face clouding--rebukingly but not severely_). That's\nmy business, Mr. Slocum. I'll thank you to steer a clear course o'\nthat. (_A pause._) The ice'll break up soon to no'th'rd. I could\nsee it startin' to-day. And when it goes and we git some sun,\nAnnie'll perk up. (_Another pause--then he bursts forth_) It ain't\nthe damned money what's keepin' me up in the Northern seas, Tom.\nBut I can't go back to Homeport with a measly four hundred barrel\nof ile. I'd die fust. I ain't never come back home in all my days\nwithout a full ship. Ain't that truth?\n\nMATE. Yes, sir; but this voyage you been ice-bound, an'--\n\nKEENEY (_scornfully_). And d' you s'pose any of 'em would believe\nthat--any o' them skippers I've beaten voyage after voyage? Can't\nyou hear 'em laughin' and sneerin'--Tibbots 'n' Harris 'n' Simms\nand the rest--and all o' Homeport makin' fun o' me? \"Dave Keeney\nwhat boasts he's the best whalin' skipper out o' Homeport comin'\nback with a measly four hundred barrel of ile?\" (_The thought of\nthis drives him into a frenzy, and he smashes his fist down on\nthe marble top of the sideboard._) Hell! I got to git the ile, I\ntell you. How could I figger on this ice? It's never been so bad\nbefore in the thirty year I been a-comin' here. And now it's\nbreakin'up. In a couple o'days it'll be all gone. And they's\nwhale here, plenty of 'em. I know they is and I ain't never gone\nwrong yit. I got to git the ile! I got to git it in spite of all\nhell, and by God, I ain't a-goin' home till I do git it!\n\n(_There is the sound of subdued sobbing from the door in rear. The\ntwo men stand silent for a moment, listening. Then_ KEENEY _goes\nover to the door and looks in. He hesitates for a moment as if he\nwere going to enter--then closes the door softly._ JOE, _the\nharpooner, an enormous six-footer with a battered, ugly face,\nenters from right and stands waiting for the captain to notice\nhim._)\n\nKEENEY (_turning and seeing him_). Don't be standin' there like a\ngawk, Harpooner. Speak up!\n\nJOE (_confusedly_). We want--the men, sir--they want send a\ndepitation aft to have a word with you.\n\nKEENEY (_furiously_). Tell 'em to go to--(_checks himself and\ncontinues grimly_) Tell'em to come. I'll see'em.\n\nJOE. Aye, aye, sir.\n\n(_He goes out._)\n\nKEENEY (_with a grim smile_). Here it comes, the trouble you spoke\nof, Mr. Slocum, and we'll make short shift of it. It's better to\ncrush such things at the start than let them make headway.\n\nMATE (_worriedly_). Shall I wake up the First and Fourth, sir? We\nmight need their help.\n\nKEENEY. No, let them sleep. I'm well able to handle this alone,\nMr. Slocum.\n\n(_There is the shuffling of footsteps from outside and five of the\ncrew crowd into the cabin, led by_ JOE. _All are dressed\nalike--sweaters, sea-boots, etc. They glance uneasily at the_\nCAPTAIN, _twirling their fur caps in their hands._)\n\nKEENEY (_after a pause_). Well? Who's to speak fur ye?\n\nJOE (_stepping forward with an air of bravado_). I be.\n\nKEENEY (_eyeing him up and down coldly_). So you be. Then speak\nyour say and be quick about it.\n\nJOE (_trying not to wilt before the CAPTAIN'S glance and avoiding\nhis eyes_). The time we signed up for is done to-day.\n\nKEENEY (_icily_). You're tellin' me nothin' I don't know.\n\nJOE. You ain't p'intin' fur home yit, far's we kin see.\n\nKEENEY. No, and I ain't agoin' to till this ship is full of ile.\n\nJOE. You can't go no further no'the with the ice afore ye.\n\nKEENEY. The ice is breaking up.\n\nJOB (_after a slight pause during which the others mumble angrily\nto one another_). The grub we're gittin' now is rotten.\n\nKEENEY. It's good enough fur ye. Better men than ye are have\neaten worse.\n\n(_There is a chorus of angry exclamations from the crowd._)\n\nJOE (_encouraged by this support_). We ain'ta-goin' to work no more\n'less you puts back fur home.\n\nKEENEY (_fiercely_). You ain't, ain't you?\n\nJOE. No; and the law courts 'll say we was right.\n\nKEENEY. To hell with your law courts! We're at sea now and I'm\nthe law on this ship. (_Edging up toward the harpooner._) And every\nmother's son of you what don't obey orders goes in irons.\n\n(_There are more angry exclamations from the crew._ MRS. KEENEY\n_appears in the doorway in rear and looks on with startled eyes.\nNone of the men notices her._)\n\nJOE (_with bravado_). Then we're a-goin' to mutiny and take the\nold hooker home ourselves. Ain't we, boys?\n\n(_As he turns his head to look at the others_, KEENEY'S _fist\nshoots out to the side of his jaw._ JOE _goes down in a heap and\nlies there._ MRS. KEENEY _gives a shriek and hides her face in\nher hands. The men pull out their sheath knives and start a rush,\nbut stop when they find themselves confronted by the revolvers\nof_ KEENEY _and the_ MATE.)\n\nKEENEY (_his eyes and voice snapping_). Hold still! (_The men\nstand huddled together in a sullen silence._ KEENEY'S _voice is\nfull of mockery._) You've found out it ain't safe to mutiny on\nthis ship, ain't you? And now git for'ard where ye belong, and\n(_he gives_ JOE'S _body a contemptuous kick_) drag him with you.\nAnd remember, the first man of ye I see shirkin' I'll shoot dead\nas sure as there's a sea under us, and you can tell the rest the\nsame. Git for'ard now! Quick! (_The men leave in cowed silence,\ncarrying_ JOE _with them._ KEENEY _turns to the_ MATE _with a\nshort laugh and puts his revolver back in his pocket._) Best get\nup on deck, Mr. Slocum, and see to it they don't try none of\ntheir skulkin' tricks. We'll have to keep an eye peeled from now\non. I know 'em.\n\nMATE. Yes, sir.\n\n(_He goes out, right._ KEENEY _hears his wife's hysterical\nweeping and turns around in surprise--then walks slowly to her\nside._)\n\nKEENEY (_putting an arm around her shoulder--with gruff\ntenderness_). There, there, Annie. Don't be afeard. It's all past\nand gone.\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_shrinking away from, him_). Oh, I can't bear it! I\ncan't bear it any longer!\n\nKEENEY (_gently_). Can't bear what, Annie?\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_hysterically_). All this horrible brutality, and\nthese brutes of men, and this terrible ship, and this prison cell\nof a room, and the ice all around, and the silence.\n\n(_After this outburst she calms down and wipes her eyes with her\nhandkerchief._)\n\nKEENEY (_after a pause during which he looks down at her with a\npuzzled frown_). Remember, I warn't hankerin' to have you come on\nthis voyage, Annie.\n\nMRS. KEENEY. I wanted to be with you, David, don't you see? I\ndidn't want to wait back there in the house all alone as I've\nbeen doing these last six years since we were married--waiting,\nand watching, and fearing--with nothing to keep my mind\noccupied--not able to go back teaching school on account of being\nDave Keeney's wife. I used to dream of sailing on the great,\nwide, glorious ocean. I wanted to be by your side in the danger\nand vigorous life of it all. I wanted to see you the hero they\nmake you out to be in Homeport. And instead--(_her voice grows\ntremulous_) all I find is ice--and cold--and brutality!\n\n(_Her voice breaks._)\n\nKEENEY. I warned you what it'd be, Annie. \"Whalin' ain't no\nladies' tea party,\" I says to you, \"and you better stay to home\nwhere you've got all your woman's comforts.\" (_Shaking his head_)\nBut you was so set on it.\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_wearily_). Oh, I know it isn't your fault, David. You\nsee, I didn't believe you. I guess I was dreaming about the old\nVikings in the story-books and I thought you were one of them.\n\nKEENEY (_protestingly_). I done my best to make it as cozy and\ncomfortable as could be. (MRS. KEENEY _looks around her in wild\nscorn._) I even sent to the city for that organ for ye, thinkin'\nit might be soothin' to ye to be playin' it times when they was\ncalms and things was dull like.\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_wearily_). Yes, you were very kind, David. I know\nthat. (_She goes to left and lifts the curtains from the porthole\nand looks out--then suddenly bursts forth._) I won't stand it--I\ncan't stand it--pent up by these walls like a prisoner. (_She runs\nover to him and throws her arms around him, weeping. He puts his\narm protectingly over her shoulders._) Take me away from here,\nDavid! If I don't get away from here, out of this terrible ship,\nI'll go mad! Take me home, David! I can't think any more. I feel\nas if the cold and the silence were crushing down on my brain.\nI'm afraid. Take me home!\n\nKEENEY (_holds her at arm's length and looks at her face\nanxiously_). Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't yourself. You got\nfever. Your eyes look so strange like. I ain't never seen you\nlook this way before.\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_laughing hysterically_). It's the ice and the cold\nand the silence--they'd make anyone look strange.\n\nKEENEY (_soothingly_). In a month or two, with good luck, three at\nthe most, I'll have her filled with ile and then we'll give her\neverything she'll stand and p'int for home.\n\nMRS. KEENEY. But we can't wait for that--I can't wait. I want to\nget home. And the men won't wait. They want to get home. It's\ncruel, it's brutal for you to keep them. You must sail back.\nYou've got no excuse. There's clear water to the south now. If\nyou've a heart at all, you've got to turn back.\n\nKEENEY (_harshly_). I can't, Annie.\n\nMRS. KEENEY. Why can't you?\n\nKEENEY. A woman couldn't rightly understand my reason.\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_wildly_). Because it's a stupid, stubborn reason. Oh,\nI heard you talking with the second mate. You're afraid the other\ncaptains will sneer at you because you didn't come back with a\nfull ship. You want to live up to our silly reputation even if\nyou do have to beat and starve men and drive me mad to do it.\n\nKEENEY (_his jaw set stubbornly_). It ain't that, Annie. Them\nskippers would never dare sneer to my face. It ain't so much what\nanyone'd say--but--(_He hesitates, struggling to express his\nmeaning._) You see--I've always done it--since my first voyage as\nskipper. I always come back--with a full ship--and--it don't seem\nright not to--somehow. I been always first whalin' skipper out o'\nHomeport, and--Don't you see my meanin', Annie? (_He glances at\nher. She is not looking at him but staring dully in front of her,\nnot hearing a word he is saying._) Annie! (_She comes to herself\nwith a start._) Best turn in, Annie, there's a good woman. You\nain't well.\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_resisting his attempts to guide her to the door in\nrear_). David! Won't you please turn back?\n\nKEENEY (_gently_). I can't, Annie--not yet awhile. You don't see my\nmeanin'. I got to git the ile.\n\nMRS. KEENEY. It'd be different if you needed the money, but you\ndon't. You've got more than plenty.\n\nKEENEY (_impatiently_). It ain't the money I'm thinkin' of. D'you\nthink I'm as mean as that?\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_dully_). No--I don't know--I can't\nunderstand--(_Intensely_) Oh, I want to be home in the old house\nonce more and see my own kitchen again, and hear a woman's voice\ntalking to me and be able to talk to her. Two years! It seems so\nlong ago--as if I'd been dead and could never go back.\n\nKEENEY (_worried by her strange tone and the far-away look in her\neyes_). Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't well.\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_not appearing to hear him_). I used to be lonely when\nyou were away. I used to think Homeport was a stupid, monotonous\nplace. Then I used to go down on the beach, especially when it\nwas windy and the breakers were rolling in, and I'd dream of the\nfine free life you must be leading. (_She gives a laugh which is\nhalf a sob._) I used to love the sea then. (_She pauses; then\ncontinues with slow intensity._) But now--I don't ever want to see\nthe sea again.\n\nKEENEY (_thinking to humor her_). 'Tis no fit place for a woman,\nthat's sure. I was a fool to bring ye.\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_after a pause--passing her hand over her eyes with a\ngesture of pathetic weariness_). How long would it take us to\nreach home--if we started now?\n\nKEENEY (_frowning_). 'Bout two months, I reckon, Annie, with fair\nluck.\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_counts on her fingers--then murmurs with a rapt\nsmile_). That would be August, the latter part of August, wouldn't\nit? It was on the twenty-fifth of August we were married, David,\nwasn't it?\n\nKEENEY (_trying to conceal the fact that her memories have moved\nhim--gruffly_). Don't you remember?\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_vaguely--again passes her hand over her eyes_). My\nmemory is leaving me--up here in the ice. It was so long ago. (_A\npause--then she smiles dreamily._) It's June now. The lilacs will\nbe all in bloom in the front yard--and the climbing roses on the\ntrellis to the side of the house--they're budding.\n\n(_She suddenly covers her face with her hands and commences to\nsob._)\n\nKEENEY (_disturbed_). Go in and rest, Annie. You're all wore out\ncryin' over what can't be helped.\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_suddenly throwing her arms around his neck and\nclinging to him_). You love me, don't you, David?\n\nKEENEY (_in amazed embarrassment at this outburst_) Love you? Why\nd'you ask me such a question, Annie?\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_shaking him--fiercely_). But you do, don't you,\nDavid? Tell me!\n\nKEENEY. I'm your husband, Annie, and you're my wife. Could there\nbe aught but love between us after all these years?\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_shaking him again--still more fiercely_). Then you do\nlove me. Say it!\n\nKEENEY (_simply_). I do, Annie.\n\nMRS. KEENEY. (_Gives a sigh of relief--her hands drop to her\nsides._ KEENEY _regards her anxiously. She passes her hand across\nher eyes and murmurs half to herself._) I sometimes think if we\ncould only have had a child. (KEENEY _turns away from her, deeply\nmoved. She grabs his arm and turns him around to face\nher--intensely._) And I've always been a good wife to you,\nhaven't I, David?\n\nKEENEY (_his voice betraying his emotion_). No man ever had a\nbetter, Annie.\n\nMRS. KEENEY. And I've never asked for much from you, have I,\nDavid? Have I?\n\nKEENEY. You know you could have all I got the power to give ye,\nAnnie.\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_wildly_). Then do this, this once, for my sake, for\nGod's sake--take me home! It's killing me, this life--the\nbrutality and cold and horror of it. I'm going mad. I can feel\nthe threat in the air. I can hear the silence threatening me--day\nafter gray day and every day the same. I can't bear it.\n(_Sobbing._) I'll go mad, I know I will. Take me home, David, if\nyou love me as you say. I'm afraid. For the love of God, take me\nhome!\n\n(_She throws her arms around him, weeping against his shoulder.\nHis face betrays the tremendous struggle going on within him. He\nholds her out at arm's length, his expression softening. For a\nmoment his shoulders sag, he becomes old, his iron spirit weakens\nas he looks at her tear-stained face._)\n\nKEENEY (_dragging out the words with an effort_). I'll do it,\nAnnie--for your sake--if you say it's needful for ye.\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_with wild joy--kissing him_). God bless you for that,\nDavid!\n\n(_He turns away from her silently and walks toward the\ncompanionway. Just at that moment there is a clatter of footsteps\non the stairs and the_ SECOND MATE _enters the cabin._)\n\nMATE (_excitedly_). The ice is breakin' up to no'th'rd, sir.\nThere's a clear passage through the floe, and clear water beyond,\nthe lookout says.\n\n(KEENEY _straightens himself like a man coming out of a trance._\nMRS. KEENEY _looks at the_ MATE _with terrified eyes._)\n\nKEENEY (_dazedly--trying to collect his thoughts_). A clear\npassage? To no'th'rd?\n\nMATE. Yes, sir.\n\nKEENEY (_his voice suddenly grim with determination_). Then get her\nready and we'll drive her through.\n\nMATE. Aye, aye, sir.\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_appealingly_). David!\n\nKEENEY (_not heeding her_). Will the men turn to willin' or must we\ndrag 'em out?\n\nMATE. They 'll turn to willin' enough. You put the fear o' God\ninto 'em, sir. They're meek as lambs.\n\nKEENEY. Then drive 'em--both watches. (_With grim determination_)\nThey's whale t' other side o' this floe and we're going to git\n'em.\n\nMATE. Aye, aye, sir.\n\n(_He goes out hurriedly. A moment later there is the sound of\nscuffing feet from the deck outside and the_ MATE'S _voice shouting\norders._)\n\nKEENEY (_speaking aloud to himself--derisively_). And I was a-goin'\nhome like a yaller dog!\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_imploringly_). David!\n\nKEENEY (_sternly_). Woman, you ain't a-doin' right when you meddle\nin men's business and weaken 'em. You can't know my feelin's. I\ngot to prove a man to be a good husband for ye to take pride in.\nI got to git the ile, I tell ye.\n\nMRS. KEENEY (_supplicatingly_). David! Aren't you going home?\n\nKEENEY (_ignoring this question--commandingly_). You ain't well. Go\nand lay down a mite. (_He starts for the door._) I got to git on\ndeck.\n\n(_He goes out. She cries after him in anguish, \"David!\" A pause.\nShe passes her hand across her eyes--then commences to laugh\nhysterically and goes to the organ. She sits down and starts to\nplay wildly an old hymn._ KEENEY _re\u00ebnters from the doorway to the\ndeck and stands looking at her angrily. He comes over and grabs\nher roughly by the shoulder._)\n\nKEENEY. Woman, what foolish mockin' is this? (_She laughs wildly,\nand he starts back from her in alarm._) Annie! What is it? (_She\ndoesn't answer him._ KEENEY'S _voice trembles._) Don't you know me,\nAnnie?\n\n(_He puts both hands on her shoulders and turns her around so that\nhe can look into her eyes. She stares up at him with a stupid\nexpression, a vague smile on her lips. He stumbles away from her,\nand she commences softly to play the organ again._)\n\nKEENEY (_swallowing hard--in a hoarse whisper, as if he had\ndifficulty in speaking_). You said--you was agoin' mad--God!\n\n(_A long wail is heard from the deck above: \"Ah bl-o-o-o-ow!\" A\nmoment later the_ MATE'S _face appears through the skylight. He\ncannot see_ MRS. KEENEY.)\n\nMATE (_in great excitement_). Whales, sir--a whole school of\n'em--off the starb'd quarter 'bout five mile away--big ones!\n\nKEENEY (_galvanized into action_). Are you lowerin' the boats?\n\nMATE. Yes, sir.\n\nKEENEY (_with grim decision_). I'm a-comin' with ye.\n\nMATE. Aye, aye, sir. (_Jubilantly_) You'll git the ile now right\nenough, sir.\n\n(_His head is withdrawn and he can be heard shouting orders._)\n\nKEENEY (_turning to his wife_). Annie! Did you hear him? I'll git\nthe ile. (_She doesn't answer or seem to know he is there. He\ngives a hard laugh, which is almost a groan._) I know you're\nfoolin' me, Annie. You ain't out of your mind--(_anxiously_) be\nyou? I'll git the ile now right enough--jest a little while\nlonger, Annie--then we'll turn hom'ard. I can't turn back now,\nyou see that, don't ye? I've got to git the ile. (_In sudden\nterror_) Answer me! You ain't mad, be you?\n\n(_She keeps on playing the organ, but makes no reply. The_ MATE'S\n_face appears again through the skylight._)\n\nMATE. All ready, sir.\n\n(KEENEY _turns his back on his wife and strides to the doorway,\nwhere he stands for a moment and looks back at her in anguish,\nfighting to control his feelings._)\n\nMATE. Comin', sir?\n\nKEENEY (_his face suddenly grown hard with determination_). Aye.\n\n(_He turns abruptly and goes out._ MRS. KEENEY _does not appear to\nnotice his departure. Her whole attention seems centred in the\norgan. She sits with half-closed eyes, her body swaying a little\nfrom side to side to the rhythm of the hymn. Her fingers move\nfaster and faster and she is playing wildly and discordantly as\nthe Curtain falls._)\n\n\n\n\nCAMPBELL OF KILMHOR[1]\n\nJ.A.

The old woman\nis seated on a low stool beside the peat fire in the centre of\nthe floor._\n\n_The room is scantily furnished and the women are poorly clad.\nMORAG is barefooted. At the back is the door that leads to the\noutside. On the left of the door is a small window. On the right\nside of the room there is a door that opens into a barn. MORAG\nstands for a moment at the window, looking out._\n\n\nMORAG. It is the wild night outside.\n\nMARY STEWART. Is the snow still coming down?\n\nMORAG. It is that, then--dancing and swirling with the wind too,\nand never stopping at all. Aye, and so black I cannot see the\nother side of the road.\n\nMARY STEWART. That is good.\n\n(MORAG _moves across the floor and stops irresolutely. She is\nrestless, expectant._)\n\nMORAG. Will I be putting the light in the window?\n\nMARY STEWART. Why should you be doing that? You have not heard\nhis call (_turns eagerly_), have you?\n\nMORAG (_with sign of head_). No, but the light in the window would\nshow him all is well.\n\nMARY STEWART. It would not, then! The light was to be put there\n_after_ we had heard the signal.\n\nMORAG. But on a night like this he may have been calling for long\nand we never hear him.\n\nMARY STEWART. Do not be so anxious, Morag. Keep to what he says.\nPut more peat on the fire now and sit down.\n\nMORAG (_with increasing excitement_). I canna, I canna! There is\nthat in me that tells me something is going to befall us this\nnight. Oh, that wind! Hear to it, sobbing round the house as if\nit brought some poor lost soul up to the door, and we refusing it\nshelter.\n\nMARY STEWART. Do not be fretting yourself like that. Do as I bid\nyou. Put more peats to the fire.\n\nMORAG (_at the wicker peat-basket_). Never since I.... What was\nthat?\n\n(_Both listen for a moment._)\n\nMARY STEWART. It was just the wind; it is rising more. A sore\nnight for them that are out in the heather.\n\n(MORAG _puts peat on the fire without speaking._)\n\nMARY STEWART. Did you notice were there many people going by\nto-day?\n\nMORAG. No. After daybreak the redcoats came by from Struan; and\nthere was no more till nine, when an old man like the Catechist\nfrom Killichonan passed. At four o'clock, just when the dark was\nfalling, a horseman with a lad holding to the stirrup, and\nrunning fast, went by towards Rannoch.\n\nMARY STEWART. But no more redcoats?\n\nMORAG (_shaking her head_). The road has been as quiet as the\nhills, and they as quiet as the grave. Do you think will he come?\n\nMARY STEWART. Is it you think I have the gift, girl, that you ask\nme that? All I know is that it is five days since he was here for\nmeat and drink for himself and for the others--five days and five\nnights, mind you; and little enough he took away; and those in\nhiding no' used to such sore lying, I'll be thinking. He must try\nto get through to-night. But that quietness, with no one to be\nseen from daylight till dark, I do not like it, Morag. They must\nknow something. They must be watching.\n\n(_A sound is heard by both women. They stand listening._)\n\nMARY STEWART. Haste you with the light, Morag.\n\nMORAG. But it came from the back of the house--from the hillside.\n\nMARY STEWART. Do as I tell you. The other side may be watched.\n\n(_A candle is lit and placed in the window. Girl goes hurrying to\nthe door._)\n\nMARY STEWART. Stop, stop! Would you be opening the door with a\nlight like that shining from the house? A man would be seen\nagainst it in the doorway for a mile. And who knows what eyes may\nbe watching? Put out the light now and cover the fire.\n\n(_Room is reduced to semi-darkness, and the door unbarred. Someone\nenters._)\n\nMORAG. You are cold, Dugald!\n\n(STEWART, _very exhausted, signs assent._)\n\nMORAG. And wet, oh, wet through and through!\n\nSTEWART. Erricht Brig was guarded, well guarded. I had to win\nacross the water.\n\n(_The old woman has now relit candle and taken away plaid from\nfire._)\n\nMARY STEWART. Erricht Brig--then--\n\nSTEWART (_nods_). Yes--in a corrie, on the far side of Dearig,\nhalf-way up.\n\nMARY STEWART. Himself is there then?\n\nSTEWART. Aye, and Keppoch as well, and another and a greater is\nwith them.\n\nMARY STEWART. Wheest! (_Glances at_ MORAG.)\n\nSTEWART. Mother, is it that you can--\n\nMARY STEWART. Yes, yes, Morag will bring out the food for ye to\ncarry back. It is under the hay in the barn, well hid. Morag will\nbring it.--Go, Morag, and bring it.\n\n(MORAG _enters other room or barn which opens on right._)\n\nSTEWART. Mother, I wonder at ye; Morag would never tell--never.\n\nMARY STEWART. Morag is only a lass yet. She has never been tried.\nAnd who knows what she might be made to tell.\n\nSTEWART. Well, well, it is no matter, for I was telling you where\nI left them, but not where I am to _find_ them.\n\nMARY STEWART. They are not where you said now?\n\nSTEWART. No; they left the corrie last night, and I am to find\nthem (_whispers_) in a quiet part on Rannoch moor.\n\nMARY STEWART. It is as well for a young lass not to be knowing.\nDo not tell her.\n\n(_He sits down at table; the old woman ministers to his wants._)\n\nSTEWART. A fire is a merry thing on a night like this; and a roof\nover the head is a great comfort.\n\nMARY STEWART. Ye'll no' can stop the night?\n\nSTEWART. No. I must be many a mile from here before the day\nbreaks on Ben Dearig.\n\n(MORAG _re\u00ebnters._)\n\nMORAG. It was hard to get through, Dugald?\n\nSTEWART. You may say that. I came down Erricht for three miles,\nand then when I reached low country I had to take to walking in\nthe burns because of the snow that shows a man's steps and tells\nwho he is to them that can read; and there's plenty can do that\nabroad, God knows.\n\nMORAG. But none spied ye?\n\nSTEWART. Who can tell? Before dark came, from far up on the\nslopes of Dearig I saw soldiers about; and away towards the\nRannoch Moor they were scattered all over the country like black\nflies on a white sheet. A wild cat or anything that couldna fly\ncould never have got through. And men at every brig and ford and\npass! I had to strike away up across the slopes again; and even\nso as I turned round the bend beyond Kilrain I ran straight into\na sentry sheltering behind a great rock. But after that it was\neasy going.\n\nMORAG. How could that be?\n\nSTEWART. Well, you see I took the boots off him, and then I had\nno need to mind who might see my steps in the snow.\n\nMORAG. You took the boots off him!\n\nSTEWART (_laughing_). I did that same. Does that puzzle your bonny\nhead? How does a lad take the boots off a redcoat? Find out the\nanswer, my lass, while I will be finishing my meat.\n\nMORAG. Maybe he was asleep?\n\nSTEWART. Asleep! Asleep! Well, well, he sleeps sound enough now,\nwith the ten toes of him pointed to the sky.\n\n(_The old woman has taken up dirk from table. She puts it down\nagain._ MORAG _sees the action and pushes dirk away so that it\nrolls off the table and drops to the floor. She hides her face in\nher hands._)\n\nMARY STEWART. Morag, bring in the kebbuck o' cheese. Now that all\nis well and safe it is we that will look after his comfort\nto-night. (MORAG _goes into barn._)--I mind well her mother saying\nto me--it was one day in the black winter that she died, when the\nfrost took the land in its grip and the birds fell stiff from the\ntrees, and the deer came down and put their noses to the door--I\nmind well her saying just before she died--\n\n(_Loud knocking at the door._)\n\nA VOICE. In the King's name!\n\n(_Both rise._)\n\nMARY STEWART. The hay in the barn, quick, my son.\n\n(_Knocking continues._)\n\nA VOICE. Open in the King's name!\n\n(STEWART _snatches up such articles as would reveal his presence\nand hurries into barn. He overlooks dirk on floor. The old woman\ngoes towards door._)\n\nMARY STEWART. Who is there? What do you want?\n\nA VOICE. Open, open.\n\n(MARY STEWART _opens door and_ CAMPBELL OF KILMHOR _follows_ CAPTAIN\nSANDEMAN _into the house. Behind_ KILMHOR _comes a man carrying a\nleather wallet_, JAMES MACKENZIE, _his clerk. The rear is brought\nup by soldiers carrying arms._)\n\nSANDEMAN. Ha, the bird has flown.\n\nCAMPBELL (_who has struck dirk with his foot and picked it up_).\nBut the nest is warm; look at this.\n\nSANDEMAN. It seems as if we had disturbed him at supper. Search\nthe house, men.\n\nMARY STEWART. I'm just a lonely old woman. You have been\nmisguided. I was getting through my supper.\n\nCAMPBELL (_holding up dirk_). And this was your toothpick, eh? Na!\nNa! We ken whaur we are, and wha we want, and by Cruachan, I\nthink we've got him.\n\n(_Sounds are heard from barn, and soldiers return with MORAG. She\nhas stayed in hiding from fear, and she still holds the cheese in\nher hands._)\n\nSANDEMAN. What have we here?\n\nCAMPBELL. A lass!\n\nMARY STEWART. It's just my dead brother's daughter. She was\ngetting me the cheese, as you can see.\n\nCAMPBELL. On, men, again: the other turtle doo will no' be far\naway. (_Banteringly to the old woman_) Tut, tut, Mistress Stewart,\nand do ye have her wait upon ye while your leddyship dines alane!\nA grand way to treat your dead brother's daughter; fie, fie, upon\nye!\n\n(_Soldiers reappear with_ STEWART, _whose arms are pinioned._)\n\nCAMPBELL. Did I no' tell ye! And this, Mrs. Stewart, will be your\ndead sister's son, I'm thinking; or aiblins your leddyship's\nbutler! Weel, woman, I'll tell ye this: Pharaoh spared ae butler,\nbut Erchie Campbell will no' spare anither. Na! na! Pharaoh's\ncase is no' to be taken as forming ony preceedent. And so if he\ndoesna answer certain questions we have to speir at him, before\nmorning he'll hang as high as Haman.\n\n(STEWART _is placed before the table at which_ CAMPBELL _has seated\nhimself. Two soldiers guard_ STEWART. _Another is behind_ CAMPBELL'S\n_chair and another is by the door. The clerk_, MACKENZIE, _is seated\nat up corner of table._ SANDEMAN _stands by the fire._)\n\nCAMPBELL (_to STEWART_). Weel, sir, it is within the cognizance of\nthe law that you have knowledge and information of the place of\nharbor and concealment used by certain persons who are in a state\nof proscription. Furthermore, it is known that four days ago\ncertain other proscribed persons did join with these, and that\nthey are banded together in an endeavor to secure the escape from\nthese dominions of His Majesty, King George, of certain persons\nwho by their crimes and treasons lie open to the capital charge.\nWhat say ye?\n\n(STEWART _makes no reply._)\n\nCAMPBELL. Ye admit this then?\n\n(STEWART _as before._)\n\nCAMPBELL. Come, come, my lad. Ye stand in great jeopardy. Great\naffairs of state lie behind this which are beyond your simple\nunderstanding. Speak up and it will be the better for ye.\n\n(STEWART _silent as before._)\n\nCAMPBELL. Look you. I'll be frank with you. No harm will befall\nyou this night--and I wish all in this house to note my words--no\nharm will befall you this night if you supply the information\nrequired.\n\n(STEWART _as before._)\n\nCAMPBELL (_with sudden passion_). Sandeman, put your sword to the\ncarcass o' this muckle ass and see will it louse his tongue.\n\nSTEWART. It may be as well then, Mr. Campbell, that I should say\na word to save your breath. It is this: Till you talk Rannoch\nLoch to the top of Schiehallion, ye'll no' talk me into a yea or\nnay.\n\nCAMPBELL (_quietly_). Say ye so? Noo, I widna be so very sure if I\nwere you. I've had a lairge experience o' life, and speaking out\nof it I would say that only fools and the dead never change their\nminds.\n\nSTEWART (_quietly too_). Then you'll be adding to your experience\nto-night, Mr. Campbell, and you'll have something to put on to\nthe other side of it.\n\nCAMPBELL (_tapping his snuff-box_). Very possibly, young sir, but\nwhat I would present for your consideration is this: While ye may\nbe prepared to keep your mouth shut under the condition of a\nfool, are ye equally prepared to do so in the condition of a dead\nman?\n\n(CAMPBELL _waits expectantly._ STEWART _silent as before._)\n\nCAMPBELL. Tut, tut, now, if it's afraid ye are, my lad, with my\nhand on my heart and on my word as a gentleman--\n\nSTEWART. Afraid!\n\n(_He spits in contempt towards_ CAMPBELL.)\n\nCAMPBELL (_enraged_). Ye damned stubborn Hieland stot. (_To_\nSANDEMAN) Have him taken out. We'll get it another way.\n\n(CAMPBELL _rises._ STEWART _is moved into barn by soldiers._)\n\nCAMPBELL (_walking_). Some puling eediots, Sandeman, would applaud\nthis contumacy and call it constancy. Constancy! Now, I've had a\nlairge experience o' life, and I never saw yet a sensible man\ninsensible to the touch of yellow metal. If there may be such a\nman, it is demonstrable that he is no sensible man. Fideelity!\nquotha, it's sheer obstinacy. They just see that ye want\nsomething oot o' them, and they're so damned selfish and thrawn\nthey winna pairt. And with the natural inabeelity o' their brains\nto hold mair than one idea at a time they canna see that in\nreturn you could put something into their palms far more\nprofitable. (_Sits again at table._) Aweel, bring Mistress Stewart\nup.\n\n(_Old woman is placed before him where son had been._)\n\nCAMPBELL (_more ingratiatingly_). Weel noo, Mistress Stewart, good\nwoman, this is a sair predeecament for ye to be in. I would jist\ncounsel ye to be candid. Doubtless yer mind is a' in a swirl. Ye\nkenna what way to turn. Maybe ye are like the Psalmist and say:\n\"I lookit this way and that, and there was no man to peety me, or\nto have compassion upon my fatherless children.\" But, see now, ye\nwould be wrong; and, if ye tell me a' ye ken, I'll stand freends\nwi' ye. Put your trust in Erchie Campbell.\n\nMARY STEWART. I trust no Campbell.\n\nCAMPBELL. Weel, weel noo, I'm no' jist that set up wi' them\nmyself. There's but ae Campbell that I care muckle aboot, after\na'. But, good wife, it's no' the Campbells we're trying the noo;\nso as time presses we'll jist \"_birze yont_,\" as they say\nthemselves. Noo then, speak up.\n\n(MARY STEWART _is silent._)\n\nCAMPBELL (_beginning grimly and passing through astonishment,\nexpostulation, and a feigned contempt for mother and pity for\nson, to a pretence of sadness which, except at the end, makes his\nwords come haltingly_). Ah! ye also. I suppose ye understand,\nwoman, how it will go wi' your son? (_To his clerk_) Here's a fine\nmother for ye, James! Would you believe it? She kens what would\nsave her son--the very babe she nursed at her breast; but will\nshe save him? Na! na! Sir, he may look after himself! A mother, a\nmother! Ha! ha!\n\n(CAMPBELL _laughs._ MACKENZIE _titters foolishly._ CAMPBELL _pauses to\nwatch effect of his words._)\n\nAye, you would think, James, that she would remember the time\nwhen he was but little and afraid of all the terrors that walk in\ndarkness, and how he looked up to her as to a tower of safety,\nand would run to her with outstretched hands, hiding his face\nfrom his fear, in her gown. The darkness! It is the dark night\nand a long journey before him now.\n\n(_He pauses again._)\n\nYou would think, James, that she would mind how she happit him\nfrom the cold of winter and sheltered him from the summer heats,\nand, when he began to find his footing, how she had an eye on a'\nthe beasts of the field and on the water and the fire that were\nbecome her enemies--And to what purpose all this care?--tell me\nthat, my man, to what good, if she is to leave him at the last to\ndangle from a tree at the end of a hempen rope--to see his flesh\ngiven to be meat for the fowls of the air--her son, her little\nson!\n\nMARY STEWAET. My son is guilty of no crime!\n\nCAMPBELL. Is he no'! Weel, mistress, as ye'll no' take my word\nfor it, maybe ye'll list to Mr. Mackenzie here. What say ye,\nJames?\n\nMACKENZIE. He is guilty of aiding and abetting in the concealment\nof proscribed persons; likewise with being found in the\npossession of arms, contrary to statute, both very heinous\ncrimes.\n\nCAMPBELL. Very well said, James! Forby, between ourselves, Mrs.\nStewart, the young man in my opeenion is guilty of another crime\n(_snuffs_)--he is guilty of the heinous crime of not knowing on\nwhich side his bread is buttered.--Come now--\n\nMARY STEWART. Ye durst not lay a finger on the lad, ye durst not\nhang him.\n\nMACKENZIE. And why should the gentleman not hang him if it\npleesure him?\n\n(CAMPBELL _taps snuff-box and takes pinch._)\n\nMARY STEWART (_with intensity_). Campbell of Kilmhor, lay but one\nfinger on Dugald Stewart and the weight of Ben Cruachan will be\nlight to the weight that will be laid on your soul. I will lay\nthe curse of the seven rings upon your life: I will call up the\nfires of Ephron, the blue and the green and the gray fires, for\nthe destruction of your soul: I will curse you in your homestead\nand in the wife it shelters and in the children that will never\nbear your name. Yea, and ye shall be cursed.\n\nCAMPBELL. (_Startled--betrays agitation--the snuff is spilled from\nhis trembling hand._) Hoot toot, woman! ye're, ye're--(_Angrily_) Ye\nauld beldame, to say such things to me! I'll have ye first\nwhippet and syne droont for a witch. Damn thae stubborn and\nsupersteetious cattle! (_To_ SANDEMAN) We should have come in here\nbefore him and listened in the barn, Sandeman!\n\nSANDEMAN. Ah, listen behind the door you mean! Now I never\nthought of that!\n\nCAMPBELL. Did ye not! Humph! Well, no doubt there are a good many\nthings in the universe that yet wait for your thought upon them.\nWhat would be your objections, now?\n\nSANDEMAN. There are two objections, Kilmhor, that you would\nunderstand.\n\nCAMPBELL. Name them.\n\nSANDEMAN. Well, in the first place, we have not wings like crows\nto fly--and the footsteps on the snow--Second point--the woman\nwould have told him we were there.\n\nCAMPBELL. Not if I told her I had power to clap her in Inverness\njail.\n\nMARY STEWART (_in contempt_). Yes, even if ye had told me ye had\npower to clap me in hell, Mr. Campbell.\n\nCAMPBELL. Lift me that screeching Jezebel oot o' here; Sandeman,\nwe'll mak' a quick finish o' this. (_Soldiers take her towards\nbarn._) No, not there; pitch the old girzie into the snow.\n\nMARY STEWART. Ye'll never find him, Campbell, never, never!\n\nCAMPBELL (_enraged_). Find him! Aye, by God I'll find him, if I\nhave to keek under every stone on the mountains from the Boar of\nBadenoch to the Sow of Athole. (_Old woman and soldiers go\noutside._) And now, Captain Sandeman, you an' me must have a word\nor two. I noted your objection to listening ahint doors and so\non. Now, I make a' necessary allowances for youth and the grand\nand magneeficent ideas commonly held, for a little while, in that\nperiod. I had them myself. But, man, gin ye had trod the floor of\nthe Parliament Hoose in Edinburry as long as I did, wi' a pair o'\nthin hands at the bottom o' toom pockets, ye'd ha'e shed your\nfine notions, as I did. Noo, fine pernickety noansense will no'\ndo in this business--\n\nSANDEMAN. Sir!\n\nCAMPBELL. Softly, softly, Captain Sandeman, and hear till what I\nhave to say. I have noticed with regret several things in your\nremarks and bearing which are displeasing to me. I would say just\none word in your ear; it is this. These things, Sandeman, are not\nconducive to advancement in His Majesty's service.\n\nSANDEMAN. Kilmhor, I am a soldier, and if I speak out my mind,\nyou must pardon me if my words are blunt. I do not like this\nwork, but I loathe your methods.\n\nCAMPBELL. Mislike the methods you may, but the work ye must do!\nMethods are my business. Let me tell you the true position. In ae\nword it is no more and no less than this. You and me are baith\nhere to carry out the proveesions of the Act for the Pacification\nof the Highlands. That means the cleaning up of a very big mess,\nSandeman, a very big mess. Now, what is your special office in\nthis work? I'll tell ye, man; you and your men are just beesoms\nin the hands of the law-officers of the Crown. In this district,\nI order and ye soop! (_He indicates door of barn._) Now soop,\nCaptain Sandeman.\n\nSANDEMAN (_in some agitation_). What is your purpose? What are you\nafter? I would give something to see into your mind.\n\nCAMPBELL. Ne'er fash aboot my mind: what has a soldier to do with\nony mental operations? It's His Grace's orders that concern you.\nOot wi' your man and set him up against the wa'.\n\nSANDEMAN. Kilmhor, it is murder--murder, Kilmhor!\n\nCAMPBELL. Hoots, awa', man, it's a thing o' nae special\nsignificance.\n\nSANDEMAN. I must ask you for a warrant.\n\nCAMPBELL. Quick then: Mackenzie will bring it out to you.\n\n(CLERK _begins writing._ SANDEMAN _and soldiers lead_ STEWART\n_outside_, CAMPBELL _sits till they are out._ CLERK _finishes_,\nCAMPBELL _signs warrant--and former goes._ CAMPBELL _is alone,\nsave for_ MORAG CAMERON, _who is sitting huddled up on stool by\nfire, and is unnoticed by_ CAMPBELL.)\n\nCAMPBELL (_as one speaking his thoughts aloud_). I've been beaten\nfor a' that. A strange thing, noo. Beforehand I would ha'e said\nnaething could be easier. And yet--and yet--there it is!... It\nwould have been a grand stroke for me.... Cluny--Keppoch--Lochiel,\nand maybe ... maybe--Hell! when I think of it! Just a whispered\nword--a mere pointed finger would ha'e telled a'. But no! their\nvisions, their dreams beat me. \"You'll be adding to your\nexperience to-night, Mr. Campbell, and have something to put to\nthe other side of it,\" says he; aye, and by God I have added\nsomething to it, and it is a thing I like but little--that a\ndream can be stronger than a strong man armed.--Here come I,\nArchibald Campbell of Kilmhor, invested with authority as\nlaw-officer of the Crown, bearing in my hand the power of life\nand death, fire and the sword, backed up by the visible authority\nof armed men, and yet I am powerless before the dreams of an old\nwoman and a half-grown lad--soldiers and horses and the gallows\nand yellow gold are less than the wind blowing in their\nfaces.--It is a strange thing that: it is a thing I do not\nunderstand.--It is a thing fit to sicken a man against the notion\nthat there are probabeelities on this earth.--have been beaten\nfor a' that. Aye, the pair o' them have beat me--though it's a\nmatter of seconds till one of them be dead.\n\nMORAG (_starting into upright position and staring at him; her\nvoice is like an echo to his_). Dead!\n\nCAMPBELL (_turning hastily_). What is that!\n\nMORAG. Is he dead?\n\nCAMPBELL (_grimly_). Not yet, but if ye'll look through this window\n(_he indicates window_) presently, ye'll see him gotten ready for\ndeath.\n\n(_He begins to collect articles of personal property, hat, etc._)\n\nMORAG. I will tell you.\n\nCAMPBELL (_astounded_). What!\n\nMORAG. I will tell you all you are seeking to know.\n\nCAMPBELL (_quietly_). Good God, and to think, to think I was on the\nvery act--in the very act of--tell me--tell me at once.\n\nMORAG. You will promise that he will not be hanged?\n\nCAMPBELL. He will not. I swear it.\n\nMORAG. You will give him back to me?\n\nCAMPBELL. I will give him back unhung.\n\nMORAG. Then (CAMPBELL _comes near_), in a corrie half-way up the\nfar side of Dearig--God save me!\n\nCAMPBELL. Dished after a'. I've clean dished them! Loard, Loard!\nonce more I can believe in the rationality of Thy world. (_Gathers\nup again his cloak, hat, etc._) And to think--to think--I was on\nthe very act of going away like a beaten dog!\n\nMORAG. He is safe from hanging now?\n\nCAMPBELL (_chuckles and looks out at window before replying, and\nis at door when he speaks_). Very near it, very near it. Listen!\n\n(_He holds up his hand--a volley of musketry is heard. KILMHOR\ngoes out, closing the door behind him. After a short interval of\nsilence the old woman enters and advances a few steps._)\n\nMARY STEWART. Did you hear, Morag Cameron, did you hear?\n\n(_The girl is sobbing, her head on her arms._)\n\nMARY STEWART. Och! be quiet now; I would be listening till the\nlast sound of it passes into the great hills and over all the\nwide world.--It is fitting for you to be crying, a child that\ncannot understand; but water shall never wet eye of mine for\nDugald Stewart. Last night I was but the mother of a lad that\nherded sheep on the Athole hills: this morn it is I that am the\nmother of a man who is among the great ones of the earth. All\nover the land they will be telling of Dugald Stewart. Mothers\nwill teach their children to be men by him. High will his name be\nwith the teller of fine tales.--The great men came, they came in\ntheir pride, terrible like the storm they were, and cunning with\nwords of guile were they. Death was with them.... He was but a\nlad, a young lad, with great length of days before him, and the\ngrandeur of the world. But he put it all from him. \"Speak,\" said\nthey, \"speak, and life and great riches will be for yourself.\"\nBut he said no word at all! Loud was the swelling of their wrath!\nLet the heart of you rejoice, Morag Cameron, for the snow is red\nwith his blood. There are things greater than death. Let them\nthat are children shed the tears.\n\n(_She comes forward and lays her hand on the girl's shoulder._)\n\nMARY STEWART. Let us go and lift him into the house, and not be\nleaving him lie out there alone.\n\n                        [CURTAIN]\n\n\n\n\nTHE SUN[1]\n\nJohn Glasworthy\n\n\nSCENE: A GIRL sits crouched over her knees on a stile close to a\nriver. A MAN with a silver badge stands beside her clutching the\nworn top plank. THE GIRL'S level brows are drawn together; her\neyes see her memories. THE MAN'S eyes see THE GIRL; he has a\ndark, twisted face. The bright sun shines; the quiet river flows;\nthe cuckoo is calling; the mayflower is in bloom along the hedge\nthat ends in the stile on the towing-path.\n\n[Footnote 1: From _Scribner's Magazine_, May, 1919.\nCopyright by Charles Scribner's Sons; included by special\npermission of the writer and publishers.]\n\nTHE GIRL. God knows what 'e'll say, Jim.\n\nTHE MAN. Let 'im. 'E's come too late, that's all.\n\nTHE GIRL. He couldn't come before. I'm frightened. 'E was fond o'\nme.\n\nTHE MAN. And aren't I fond of you? My Gawd!\n\nTHE GIRL. I ought to 'a' waited, Jim; with 'im in the fightin'.\n\nTHE MAN (_passionately_). And what about me? Aren't I been in the\nfightin'--earned all I could get?\n\nTHE GIRL (_touching him_). Ah!\n\nTHE MAN. Did you--\n\n(_He cannot speak the words._)\n\nTHE GIRL. Not like you, Jim--not like you.\n\nTHE MAN. 'Ave a spirit, then.\n\nTHE GIRL. I promised 'im.\n\nTHE MAN. One man's luck'a another's poison. I've seen it.\n\nTHE GIRL. I ought to 'a' waited. I never thought 'e'd come back\nfrom the fightin'.\n\nTHE MAN (_grimly_). Maybe 'e'd better not 'ave.\n\nTHE GIRL (_looking back along the tow-path_). What'll 'e be like, I\nwonder?\n\nTHE MAN (_gripping her shoulder_). Daise, don't you never go back\non me, or I should kill you, and 'im too.\n\n(THE GIRL _looks at him, shivers, and puts her lips to his._)\n\nTHE GIRL. I never could.\n\nTHE MAN. Will you run for it? 'E'd never find us.\n\n(THE GIRL _shakes her head._)\n\nTHE MAN (_dully_). What's the good o' stayin'? The world's wide.\n\nTHE GIRL. I'd rather have it off me mind, with him 'ome.\n\nTHE MAN (_clenching his hands_). It's temptin' Providence.\n\nTHE GIRL. What's the time, Jim?\n\nTHE MAN (_glancing at the sun_). 'Alf past four.\n\nTHE GIRL (_looking along the towing-path_). 'E said four o'clock.\nJim, you better go.\n\nTHE MAN. Not I. _I've_ not got the wind up. I've seen as\nmuch of hell as he has, any day. What like is he?\n\nTHE GIRL (_dully_). I dunno, just. I've not seen 'im these three\nyears. I dunno no more, since I've known you.\n\nTHE MAN. Big, or little chap?\n\nTHE GIRL. 'Bout your size. Oh! Jim, go along!\n\nTHE MAN. No fear! What's a blighter like that to old Fritz's\nshells? We didn't shift when they was comin'. If you'll go, I'll\ngo; not else.\n\n(_Again she shakes her head._)\n\nTHE GIRL. Jim, do you love me true? (_For answer_, THE MAN _takes\nher avidly in his arms._) I ain't ashamed--I ain't ashamed. If 'e\ncould see me 'eart.\n\nTHE MAN. Daise! If I'd known you out there I never could 'a'\nstuck it. They'd 'a' got me for a deserter. That's 'ow I love\nyou!\n\nTHE GIRL. Jim, don't lift your 'and to 'im. Promise!\n\nTHE MAN. That's according.\n\nTHE GIRL. Promise!\n\nTHE MAN. If 'e keeps quiet, I won't. But I'm not accountable--not\nalways, I tell you straight--not since I've been through that.\n\nTHE GIRL (_with a shiver_). Nor p'r'aps 'e isn't.\n\nTHE MAN. Like as not. It takes the lynchpins out, I tell you.\n\nTHE GIRL. God 'elp us!\n\nTHE MAN (_grimly_). Ah! We said that a bit too often. What we want,\nwe take, now; there's no one to give it us, and there's no\nfear'll stop us; we seen the bottom o' things.\n\nTHE GIRL. P'r'aps 'e'll say that too.\n\nTHE MAN. Then it'll be 'im or me.\n\nTHE GIRL. I'm frightened.\n\nTHE MAN (_tenderly_). No, Daise, no! (_He takes out a knife._) The\nriver's 'andy. One more or less. 'E shan't 'arm you; nor me\nneither.\n\nTHE GIRL (_seizing his hand_). Oh! no! Give it to me, Jim!\n\nTHE MAN (_smiling_). No fear! (_He puts it away._) Shan't 'ave no\nneed for it, like as not. All right, little Daise; you can't be\nexpected to see things like what we do. What's a life, anyway?\nI've seen a thousand taken in five minutes. I've seen dead men on\nthe wires like flies on a fly-paper; I've been as good as dead\nmeself an 'undred times. I've killed a dozen men. It's nothin'.\n'E's safe, if 'e don't get my blood up. If 'e does, nobody's\nsafe; not 'im, nor anybody else; not even you. I'm speakin'\nsober.\n\nTHE GIRL (_softly_). Jim, you won't go fightin', wi' the sun out\nand the birds all callin'?\n\nTHE MAN. That depends on 'im. I'm not lookin' for it. Daise, I\nlove you. I love your eyes. I love your hair. I love you.\n\nTHE GIRL. And I love you, Jim. I don't want nothin' more than you\nin the whole world.\n\nTHE MAN. Amen to that, my dear. Kiss me close!\n\n(_The sound of a voice singing breaks in on their embrace._ THE\nGIRL _starts from his arms and looks behind her along the\ntowing-path._ THE MAN _draws back against the hedge, fingering his\nside, where the knife is hidden. The song comes nearer._)\n\n  I'll be right there to-night\n  Where the fields are snowy white;\n  Banjos ringin', darkies singin'--\n  All the world seems bright.\n\nTHE GIRL. It's 'im!\n\nTHE MAN. Don't get the wind up, Daise. I'm here!\n\n(_The singing stops. A man's voice says: Christ! It's Daise; it's\nlittle Daise 'erself_! THE GIRL _stands rigid.

Daise! Hallo, old pretty girl!\n\n(THE GIRL _does not move, barring the way, as it were._)\n\nTHE GIRL. Hallo, Jack! (_Softly_) I got things to tell you.\n\nSOLDIER. What sort o' things, this lovely day? Why, I got things\nthat'd take me years to tell. 'Ave you missed me, Daise?\n\nTHE GIRL. You been so long.\n\nSOLDIER. So I 'ave. My Gawd! It's a way they 'ave in the Army. I\nsaid when I got out of it I'd laugh. Like as the sun itself I\nused to think of you, Daise, when the crumps was comin' over, and\nthe wind was up. D' you remember that last night in the wood?\n\"Come back, and marry me quick, Jack!\" Well, 'ere I am--got me\npass to 'eaven. No more fightin', an' trampin,' no more sleepin\"\nrough. We can get married now, Daise. We can live soft an' 'appy.\nGive us a kiss, old pretty.\n\nTHE GIRL (_drawing back_). No.\n\nSOLDIER (_blankly_). Why not?\n\n(THE MAN, _with a swift movement, steps along the hedge to_ THE\nGIRL'S _side._)\n\nTHE MAN. That's why, soldier.\n\nSOLDIER (_leaping over the stile_). 'Oo are you, Pompey? The sun\ndon't shine in your inside, do it? 'Oo is 'e, Daise?\n\nTHE GIRL. My man.\n\nSOLDIER. Your--man! Lummy! \"Taffy was a Welshman, Taffy was a\nthief\"! Well, soldier? So you've been through it, too. I'm\nlaughin' this mornin', as luck will 'ave it. Ah! I can see your\nknife.\n\nTHE MAN (_who has half drawn his knife_). Don't laugh at _me_,\nI tell you.\n\nSOLDIER. Not at you, soldier, not at you. (_He looks from one to\nthe other._) I'm laughin' at things in general. Where did you get\nit, soldier?\n\nTHE MAN (_watchfully_). Through the lung.\n\nSOLDIER. Think o' that! An' I never was touched. Four years an'\nnever was touched. An' so you've come an' took my girl. Nothin'\ndoin'! Ha! (_Again he looks from one to the other--then away._)\nWell! The world's before me. (_He laughs._) I'll give you Daise for\na lung protector.\n\nTHE MAN (_fiercely_). You won't. I've took her.\n\nSOLDIER. That's all right, then. You keep 'er. I've got a laugh\nin me you can't put out, black as you are! Good-bye, little Daise!\n\n(THE GIRL _makes a movement toward him._)\n\nTHE MAN. Don't touch 'im!\n\n(THE GIRL _stands hesitating, and suddenly bursts into tears._)\n\nSOLDIER. Look 'ere, soldier; shake 'ands! I don't want to see a\ngirl cry, this day of all, with the sun shinin'. I seen too much\no' sorrer. You an' me've been at the back of it. We've 'ad our\nwhack. Shake!\n\nTHE MAN. Who are you kiddin'?

There's nothin'\nfor it but a laugh. You an' me know that. Laugh, soldier!\n\nTHE MAN. You blarsted--\n\n(THE GIRL _springs to him and stops his mouth._)\n\nSOLDIER. It's no use, soldier. I can't do it. I said I'd laugh\nto-day, and laugh I will. I've come through that, an' all the\nstink of it; I've come through sorrer. Never again! Cheer-o,\nmate!

He\ncarries a cap with a long, red feather._)\n\nTHE MANAGER (_bowing deeply_). Ladies and gentlemen, you are about\nto hear the truth of an old legend that has persisted wrongly\nthrough the ages, the truth that, until now, has been hid behind\nthe embroidered curtain of a rhyme, about the Knave of Hearts,\nwho was no knave but a very hero indeed. The truth, you will\nagree with me, gentlemen and most honored ladies, is rare! It is\nonly the quiet, unimpassioned things of nature that seem what\nthey are. Clouds rolled in massy radiance against the blue, pines\nshadowed deep and darkly green, mirrored in still waters, the\ncontemplative mystery of the hills--these things which exist,\nabsorbed but in their own existence--these are the perfect\nchalices of truth.\n\nBut we, gentlemen and thrice-honored ladies, flounder about in a\ntangled net of prejudice, of intrigue. We are blinded by\nconventions, we are crushed by misunderstanding, we are\ndistracted by violence, we are deceived by hypocrisy, until only\ntoo often villains receive the rewards of nobility and the truly\ngreat-hearted are suspected, distrusted, and maligned.\n\nAnd so, ladies and gentlemen, for the sake of justice and also, I\ndare to hope, for your approval, I have taken my puppets down\nfrom their dusty shelves. I have polished their faces, brushed\ntheir clothes, and strung them on wires, so that they may enact\nfor you this history.\n\n(_He parts the curtains, revealing two_ PASTRY COOKS _in flaring\nwhite caps and spotless aprons leaning over in stiff profile,\ntheir wooden spoons, three feet long, pointing rigidly to the\nceiling. They are in one of the kitchens of_ POMPDEBILE THE\nEIGHTH, KING OF HEARTS. _It is a pleasant kitchen, with a row of\nlittle dormer windows and a huge stove, adorned with the crest of_\nPOMPDEBILE--_a heart rampant, on a gold shield._)\n\nTHE MANAGER. You see here, ladies and gentlemen, two pastry cooks\nbelonging to the royal household of Pompdebile the Eighth--Blue\nHose and Yellow Hose, by name. At a signal from me they will\nspring to action, and as they have been made with astonishing\ncleverness, they will bear every semblance of life. Happily,\nhowever, you need have no fear that, should they please you, the\nexulting wine of your appreciation may go to their heads--their\nheads being but things of wire and wood; and happily, too, as\nthey are but wood and wire, they will be spared the shame and\nhumiliation that would otherwise be theirs should they fail to\nmeet with your approval.\n\nThe play, most honored ladies and gentlemen, will now begin.\n\n(_He claps his hands. Instantly the two_ PASTRY COOKS _come to life._\nTHE MANAGER _bows himself off the stage._)\n\nBLUE HOSE. Is everything ready for this great event?\n\nYELLOW HOSE. Everything. The fire blazing in the stove, the\nPages, dressed in their best, waiting in the pantry with their\nvarious jars full of the finest butter, the sweetest sugar, the\nhottest pepper, the richest milk, the--\n\nBLUE HOSE. Yes, yes, no doubt. (_Thoughtfully_) It is a great\nresponsibility, this that they have put on our shoulders.\n\nYELLOW HOSE. Ah, yes. I have never felt more important.\n\nBLUE HOSE. Nor I more uncomfortable.\n\nYELLOW HOSE. Even on the day, or rather the night, when I awoke\nand found myself famous--I refer to the time when I laid before\nan astonished world my creation, \"Humming birds' hearts souffle,\nau vin blanc\"--I did not feel more important. It is a pleasing\nsensation!\n\nBLUE HOSE. I like it not at all. It makes me dizzy, this eminence\non which they have placed us. The Lady Violetta is slim and fair.\nShe does not, in my opinion, look like the kind of person who is\ncapable of making good pastry. I have discovered through long\nexperience that it is the heaviest women who make the lightest\npastry, and _vice versa._ Well, then, suppose that she does\nnot pass this examination--suppose that her pastry is lumpy,\nwhite like the skin of a boiled fowl.\n\nYELLOW HOSE. Then, according to the law of the Kingdom of Hearts,\nwe must condemn it, and the Lady Violetta cannot become the bride\nof Pompdebile. Back to her native land she will be sent, riding a\nmule.\n\nBLUE HOSE. And she is so pretty, so exquisite! What a law! What\nan outrageous law!\n\nYELLOW HOSE. Outrageous law! How dare you! There is nothing so\nnecessary to the welfare of the nation as our art. Good cooks\nmake good tempers, don't they? Must not the queen set an example\nfor the other women to follow? Did not our fathers and our\ngrandfathers before us judge the dishes of the previous queens of\nhearts?\n\nBLUE HOSE. I wish I were mixing the rolls for to-morrow's\nbreakfast.\n\nYELLOW HOSE. Bah! You are fit for nothing else. The affairs of\nstate are beyond you.\n\n(_Distant sound of trumpets._)\n\nBLUE HOSE (_nervously_). What's that?\n\nYELLOW HOSE. The King is approaching! The ceremonies are about to\ncommence!\n\nBLUE HOSE. Is everything ready?\n\nYELLOW HOSE. I told you that everything was ready. Stand still;\nyou are as white as a stalk of celery.\n\nBLUE HOSE (_counting on his fingers_). Apples, lemons, peaches,\njam--Jam! Did you forget jam?\n\nYELLOW HOSE. Zounds, I did!\n\nBLUE HOSE (_wailing_). We are lost!\n\nYELLOW HOSE. She may not call for it.\n\n(_Both stand very erect and make a desperate effort to appear\ncalm._)\n\nBLUE HOSE (_very nervous_). Which door? Which door?\n\nYELLOW HOSE. The big one, idiot. Be still!\n\n(_The sound of trumpets increases, and cries of \"Make way for the\nKing.\" Two_ HERALDS _come in and stand on either side of the door.\nThe_ KING OF HEARTS _enters, followed by ladies and gentlemen of\nthe court._ POMPDEBILE _is in full regalia, and very imposing\nindeed with his red robe bordered with ermine, his crown and\nsceptre. After him comes the_ CHANCELLOR, _an old man with a short,\nwhite beard. The_ KING _strides in a particularly kingly fashion,\npointing his toes in the air at every step, toward his throne,\nand sits down. The_ KNAVE _walks behind him slowly. He has a sharp,\npale face._)\n\nPOMPDEBILE (_impressively_). Lords and ladies of the court, this is\nan important moment in the history of our reign. The Lady\nVioletta, whom you love and respect--that is, I mean to say, whom\nthe ladies love and the lords--er--respect, is about to prove\nwhether or not she be fitted to hold the exalted position of\nQueen of Hearts, according to the law, made a thousand years ago\nby Pompdebile the Great, and steadily followed ever since. She\nwill prepare with her own delicate, white hands a dish of pastry.\nThis will be judged by the two finest pastry cooks in the land.\n\n(BLUE HOSE _and_ YELLOW HOSE _bow deeply._)\n\nIf their verdict be favorable, she shall ride through the streets\nof the city on a white palfrey, garlanded with flowers. She will\nbe crowned, the populace will cheer her, and she will reign by\nour side, attending to the domestic affairs of the realm, while\nwe give our time to weightier matters. This of course you all\nunderstand is a time of great anxiety for the Lady Violetta. She\nwill appear worried--(_To_ CHANCELLOR) The palfrey is in readiness,\nwe suppose.\n\nCHANCELLOR. It is, Your Majesty.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Garlanded with flowers?\n\nCHANCELLOR. With roses, Your Majesty.\n\nKNAVE (_bowing_). The Lady Violetta prefers violets, Your Majesty.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Let there be a few violets put in with the\nroses--er--We are ready for the ceremony to commence. We confess\nto a slight nervousness unbecoming to one of our station. The\nLady Violetta, though trying at times, we have found--er--shall\nwe say--er--satisfying?\n\nKNAVE (_bowing_). Intoxicating, Your Majesty?\n\nCHANCELLOR (_shortly_). His Majesty means nothing of the sort.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. No, of course not--er--The mule--Is that--did you--?\n\nCHANCELLOR (_in a grieved tone_). This is hardly necessary. Have I\never neglected or forgotten any of your commands, Your Majesty?\n\nPOMPDEBILE. You have, often. However, don't be insulted. It takes\na great deal of our time and it is most uninteresting.\n\nCHANCELLOR (_indignantly_). I resign, Your Majesty.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Your thirty-seventh resignation will be accepted\nto-morrow. Just now it is our wish to begin at once. The anxiety\nthat no doubt gathered in the breast of each of the seven\nsuccessive Pompdebiles before us seems to have concentrated in\nours. Already the people are clamoring at the gates of the palace\nto know the decision. Begin. Let the Pages be summoned.\n\nKNAVE (_bowing_). Beg pardon, Your Majesty; before summoning the\nPages, should not the Lady Violetta be here?\n\nPOMPDEBILE. She should, and is, we presume, on the other side of\nthat door--waiting breathlessly.\n\n(THE KNAVE _quietly opens the door and closes it._)\n\nKNAVE (_bowing_). She is not, Your Majesty, on the other side of\nthat door waiting breathlessly. In fact, to speak plainly, she is\nnot on the other side of that door at all.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Can that be true? Where are her ladies?\n\nKNAVE. They are all there, Your Majesty.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Summon one of them.\n\n(THE KNAVE _goes out, shutting the door. He returns, following_\nURSULA, _who, very much frightened, throws herself at the_ KING'S\n_feet._)\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Where is your mistress?\n\nURSULA. She has gone, Your Majesty.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Gone! Where has she gone?\n\nURSULA. I do not know, Your Majesty. She was with us a while ago,\nwaiting there, as you commanded.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Yes, and then--speak.\n\nURSULA. Then she started out and forbade us to go with her.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. The thought of possible divorce from us was more than\nshe could bear. Did she say anything before she left?\n\nURSULA (_trembling_). Yes, Your Majesty.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. What was it? She may have gone to self-destruction.\nWhat was it?\n\nURSULA. She said--\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Speak, woman, speak.\n\nURSULA. She said that Your Majesty--\n\nPOMPDEBILE. A farewell message! Go on.\n\nURSULA (_gasping_). That Your Majesty was \"pokey\" and that she\ndidn't intend to stay there any longer.\n\nPOMPDEBILE (_roaring_). _Pokey!!_\n\nURSULA. Yes, Your Majesty, and she bade me call her when you\ncame, but we can't find her, Your Majesty.\n\n(_The_ PASTRY COOKS _whisper._ URSULA _is in tears._)\n\nCHANCELLOR. This should not be countenanced, Your Majesty. The\nword \"pokey\" cannot be found in the dictionary. It is the most\nflagrant disrespect to use a word that is not in the dictionary\nin connection with a king.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. We are quite aware of that, Chancellor, and although\nwe may appear calm on the surface, inwardly we are swelling,\n_swelling_, with rage and indignation.\n\nKNAVE (_looking out the window_). I see the Lady Violetta in the\ngarden. (_He goes to the door and holds it open, bowing._) The Lady\nVioletta is at the door, Your Majesty.\n\n(_Enter the_ LADY VIOLETTA, _her purple train over her arm. She has\nbeen running._)\n\nVIOLETTA. Am I late? I just remembered and came as fast as I\ncould. I bumped into a sentry and he fell down. I didn't. That's\nstrange, isn't it? I suppose it's because he stands in one\nposition so long he--Why, Pompy dear, what's the matter? Oh, oh!\n(_Walking closer_) Your feelings are hurt!\n\nPOMPDEBILE. _Don't_ call us Pompy. It doesn't seem to matter\nto you whether you are divorced or not.\n\nVIOLETTA (_anxiously_). Is that why your feelings are hurt?\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Our feelings are not hurt, not at all.\n\nVIOLETTA. Oh, yes, they are, Pompdebile dear. I know, because\nthey are connected with your eyebrows. When your feelings go\ndown, up go your eyebrows, and when your feelings go up, they go\ndown--always.\n\nPOMPDEBILE (_severely_). Where have you been?\n\nVIOLETTA. I, just now?\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Just now, when you should have been outside that door\nwaiting _breathlessly._\n\nVIOLETTA. I was in the garden. Really, Pompy, you couldn't expect\nme to stay all day in that ridiculous pantry; and as for being\nbreathless, it's quite impossible to be it unless one has been\njumping or something.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. What were you doing in the garden?\n\nVIOLETTA (_laughing_). Oh, it was too funny. I must tell you. I\nfound a goat there who had a beard just like the Chancellor's--really\nit was quite remarkable, the resemblance--in other ways too. I\ntook him by the horns and I looked deep into his eyes, and I\nsaid, \"Chancellor, if you try to influence Pompy--\"\n\nPOMPDEBILE (_shouting_). Don't call us Pompy.\n\nVIOLETTA. Excuse me, Pomp--\n\n(_Checking herself._)\n\nKNAVE. And yet I think I remember hearing of an emperor, a great\nemperor, named Pompey.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. We know him not. Begin at once; the people are\nclamoring at the gates. Bring the ingredients.\n\n(_The_ PASTRY COOKS _open the door, and, single file, six little\nboys march in, bearing large jars labeled butter, salt, flour,\npepper, cinnamon, and milk. The_ COOKS _place a table and a large\nbowl and a pan in front of the_ LADY VIOLETTA _and give her a\nspoon. The six little boys stand three on each side._)\n\nVIOLETTA. Oh, what darling little ingredients. May I have an\napron, please?\n\n(URSULA _puts a silk apron, embroidered with red hearts, on the_\nLADY VIOLETTA.)\n\nBLUE HOSE. We were unable to find a little boy to carry the\npepper, My Lady. They all _would_ sneeze in such a disturbing\nway.\n\nVIOLETTA. This is a perfectly controlled little boy. He hasn't\nsneezed once.\n\nYELLOW HOSE. That, if it please Your Ladyship, is not a little\nboy.\n\nVIOLETTA. Oh! How nice! Perhaps she will help me.\n\nCHANCELLOR (_severely_). You are allowed no help, Lady Violetta.\n\nVIOLETTA. Oh, Chancellor, how cruel of you. (_She takes up the\nspoon, bowing._) Your Majesty, Lords and Ladies of the court, I\npropose to make (_impressively_) raspberry tarts.\n\nBLUE HOSE. Heaven be kind to us!\n\nYELLOW HOSE (_suddenly agitated_). Your Majesty, I implore your\nforgiveness. There is no raspberry jam in the palace.\n\nPOMPDEBILE What! Who is responsible for this carelessness?\n\nBLUE HOSE. I gave the order to the grocer, but it didn't come.\n(_Aside_) I knew something like this would happen. I knew it.\n\nVIOLETTA (_untying her apron_). Then, Pompdebile, I'm very\nsorry--we shall have to postpone it.\n\nCHANCELLOR. If I may be allowed to suggest, Lady Violetta can\nprepare something else.\n\nKNAVE. The law distinctly says that the Queen-elect has the\nprivilege of choosing the dish which she prefers to prepare.\n\nVIOLETTA. Dear Pompdebile, let's give it up. It's such a silly\nlaw! Why should a great splendid ruler like you follow it just\nbecause one of your ancestors, who wasn't half as nice as you\nare, or one bit wiser, said to do it? Dearest Pompdebile, please.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. We are inclined to think that there may be something\nin what the Lady Violetta says.\n\nCHANCELLOR. I can no longer remain silent. It is due to that\nbrilliant law of Pompdebile the First, justly called the Great,\nthat all members of our male sex are well fed, and, as a natural\nconsequence, happy.\n\nKNAVE. The happiness of a set of moles who never knew the\nsunlight.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. If we made an effort, we could think of a new\nlaw--just as wise. It only requires effort.\n\nCHANCELLOR. But the constitution. We can't touch the\nconstitution.\n\nPOMPDEBILE (_starting up_). We shall destroy the constitution!\n\nCHANCELLOR. The people are clamoring at the gates!\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Oh, I forgot them. No, it has been carried too far.\nWe shall have to go on. Proceed.\n\nVIOLETTA. Without the raspberry jam?\n\nPOMPDEBILE (_to_ KNAVE). Go you, and procure some. I will give a\nhundred golden guineas for it.\n\n(_The little boy who holds the cinnamon pot comes forward._)\n\nBOY. Please, Your Majesty, I have some.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. You! Where?\n\nBOY. In my pocket. If someone would please hold my cinnamon\njar--I could get it.\n\n(UBSULA _takes it. The boy struggles with his pocket and finally,\ntriumphantly, pulls out a small jar._)\n\nThere!\n\nVIOLETTA. How clever of you! Do you always do that?\n\nBOY. What--eat raspberry jam?\n\nVIOLETTA. No, supply the exact article needed from your pocket.\n\nBOY. I eat it for my lunch. Please give me the hundred guineas.\n\nVIOLETTA. Oh, yes--Chancellor--if I may trouble you.\n\n(_Holding out her hand._)\n\nCHANCELLOR. Your Majesty, this is an outrage! Are you going to\nallow this?\n\nPOMPDEBILE (_sadly_). Yes, Chancellor. We have such an impulsive\nnature!\n\n(_The_ LADY VIOLETTA _receives the money._)\n\nVIOLETTA. Thank you. (_She gives it to the boy._) Now we are ready\nto begin. Milk, please. (_The boy who holds the milk jar comes\nforward and kneels._) I take some of this milk and beat it well.\n\nYELLOW HOSE (_in a whisper_). _Beat_ it--milk!\n\nVIOLETTA. Then I put in two tablespoonfuls of salt, taking great\ncare that it falls exactly in the middle of the bowl. (_To the\nlittle boy_) Thank you, dear. Now the flour, no, the pepper, and\nthen--one pound of butter. I hope that it is good butter, or the\nwhole thing will be quite spoiled.\n\nBLUE HOSE. This is the most astonishing thing I have ever\nwitnessed.\n\nYELLOW HOSE. I don't understand it.\n\nVIOLETTA (_stirring_). I find that the butter is _not_ very\ngood. It makes a great difference. I shall have to use more\npepper to counteract it. That's better. (_She pours in pepper. The\nboy with the pepper pot sneezes violently._) Oh, oh, dear! Lend\nhim your handkerchief, Chancellor. Knave, will you? (YELLOW HOSE\n_silences the boy's sneezes with the_ KNAVE'S _handkerchief._) I\nthink that they are going to turn out very well. Aren't you glad,\nChancellor? You shall have one if you will be glad and smile\nnicely--a little brown tart with raspberry jam in the middle. Now\nfor a dash of vinegar.\n\nCOOKS (_in horror_). Vinegar! Great Goslings! Vinegar!\n\nVIOLETTA (_stops stirring_). Vinegar will make them crumbly. Do you\nlike them crumbly, Pompdebile, darling? They are really for you,\nyou know, since I am trying, by this example, to show all the\nwives how to please all the husbands.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Remember that they are to go in the museum with the\ntests of the previous Queens.\n\nVIOLETTA (_thoughtfully_). Oh, yes, I had forgotten that. Under the\ncircumstances, I shall omit the vinegar. We don't want them too\ncrumbly. They would fall about and catch the dust so frightfully.\nThe museum-keeper would never forgive me in years to come. Now I\ndip them by the spoonful on this pan; fill them with the nice\nlittle boy's raspberry jam--I'm sorry I have to use it all, but\nyou may lick the spoon--put them in the oven, slam the door. Now,\nmy Lord Pompy, the fire will do the rest.\n\n(_She curtsies before the_ KING.)\n\nPOMPDEBILE. It gave us great pleasure to see the ease with which\nyou performed your task. You must have been practising for weeks.\nThis relieves, somewhat, the anxiety under which we have been\nsuffering and makes us think that we would enjoy a game of\ncheckers once more. How long a time will it take for your\ncreation to be thoroughly done, so that it may be tested?\n\nVIOLETTA (_considering_). About twenty minutes, Pompy.\n\nPOMPDEBILE (_to_ HERALD). Inform the people. Come, we will retire.\n(_To_ KNAVE) Let no one enter until the Lady Violetta commands.\n\n(_All exit, left, except the_ KNAVE. _He stands in deep thought, his\nchin in hand--then exits slowly, right. The room is empty. The\ncuckoo clock strikes. Presently both right and left doors open\nstealthily. Enter_ LADY VIOLETTA _at one door, the_ KNAVE _at the\nother, backward, looking down the passage. They turn suddenly and\nsee each other._)\n\nVIOLETTA (_tearfully_). O Knave, I can't cook! Anything--anything\nat all, not even a baked potato.\n\nKNAVE. So I rather concluded, My Lady, a few minutes ago.\n\nVIOLETTA (_pleadingly_). Don't you think it might just happen that\nthey turned out all right? (_Whispering_) Take them out of the\noven. Let's look.\n\nKNAVE. That's what I intended to do before you came in. It's\npossible that a miracle has occurred.\n\n(_He tries the door of the oven._)\n\nVIOLETTA. Look out; it's hot. Here, take my handkerchief.\n\nKNAVE. The gods forbid, My Lady.\n\n(_He takes his hat, and, folding it, opens the door and brings out\nthe pan, which he puts on the table softly._)\n\nVIOLETTA (_with a look of horror_) How queer! They've melted or\nsomething. See, they are quite soft and runny. Do you think that\nthey will be good for anything, Knave?\n\nKNAVE. For paste, My Lady, perhaps.\n\nVIOLETTA. Oh, dear. Isn't it dreadful!\n\nKNAVE. It is.\n\nVIOLETTA (_beginning to cry_). I don't want to be banished,\nespecially on a mule--\n\nKNAVE. Don't cry, My Lady. It's very--upsetting.\n\nVIOLETTA. I would make a delightful queen. The f\u00eates that I would\ngive--under the starlight, with soft music stealing from the\nshadows, f\u00eates all perfume and deep mystery, where the young--like\nyou and me, Knave--would find the glowing flowers of youth ready\nto be gathered in all their dewy freshness!\n\nKNAVE. Ah!\n\nVIOLETTA. Those stupid tarts! And wouldn't I make a pretty\npicture riding on the white palfrey, garlanded with flowers,\nfollowed by the cheers of the populace--Long live Queen Violetta,\nlong live Queen Violetta! Those _abominable_ tarts!\n\nKNAVE. I'm afraid that Her Ladyship is vain.\n\nVIOLETTA. I am indeed. Isn't it fortunate?\n\nKNAVE. Fortunate?\n\nVIOLETTA. Well, I mean it would be fortunate if I were going to\nbe queen. They get so much flattery. The queens who don't adore\nit as I do must be bored to death. Poor things! I'm never so\nhappy as when I am being flattered. It makes me feel all warm and\npurry. That is another reason why I feel sure I was _made_\nto be a queen.\n\nKNAVE (_looking ruefully at the pan_). You will never be queen, My\nLady, unless we can think of something quickly, some plan--\n\nVIOLETTA. Oh, yes, dear Knave, please think of a plan at once.\nBanished people, I suppose, have to comb their own hair, put on\ntheir shoes, and button themselves up the back. I have never\nperformed these estimable and worthy tasks, Knave. I don't know\nhow; I don't even know how to scent my bath. I haven't the least\nidea what makes it smell deliciously of violets. I only know that\nit always _does_ smell deliciously of violets because I wish\nit that way. I should be miserable; save me, Knave, please.\n\nKNAVE. My mind is unhappily a blank, Your Majesty.\n\nVIOLETTA. It's very unjust. Indeed, it's unjust! No other queen\nin the world has to understand cooking; even the Queen of Spades\ndoesn't. Why should the Queen of Hearts, of all people!\n\nKNAVE. Perhaps it is because--I have heard a proverb: \"The way to\nthe heart is through the--\"\n\nVIOLETTA (_angrily, stamping her foot_). Don't repeat that hateful\nproverb! Nothing can make me more angry. I feel like crying when\nI hear it, too. Now see, I'm crying. You made me.\n\nKNAVE. Why does that proverb make you cry, My Lady?\n\nVIOLETTA. Oh, because it is such a stupid proverb and so silly,\nbecause it's true in most cases, and because--I don't know why.\n\nKNAVE. We are a set of moles here. One might also say that we are\na set of mules. How can moles or mules either be expected to\nunderstand the point of view of a Bird of Paradise when she--\n\nVIOLETTA. Bird of Paradise! Do you mean me?\n\nKNAVE (_bowing_). I do, My Lady, figuratively speaking.\n\nVIOLETTA (_drying her eyes_). How very pretty of you! Do you know,\nI think that you would make a splendid chancellor.\n\nKNAVE. Her Ladyship is vain, as I remarked before.\n\nVIOLETTA (_coldly_). As I remarked before, how fortunate. Have you\nanything to suggest--a plan?\n\nKNAVE. If only there were time my wife could teach you. Her\nfigure is squat, round, her nose is clumsy, and her eyes stumble\nover it; but her cooking, ah--(_He blows a kiss_) it is a thing to\ndream about. She cooks as naturally as the angels sing. The\ndelicate flavors of her concoctions float over the palate like\nthe perfumes of a thousand flowers. True, her temper, it is\nanything but sweet--However, I am conceded by many to be the most\nhappily married man in the kingdom.\n\nVIOLETTA (_sadly_). Yes. That's all they care about here. One may\nbe, oh, so cheerful and kind and nice in every other way, but if\none can't cook nobody loves one at all.\n\nKNAVE. Beasts! My higher nature cries out at them for holding\nsuch views. Fools! Swine! But my lower nature whispers that\nperhaps after all they are not far from right, and as my lower\nnature is the only one that ever gets any encouragement--\n\nVIOLETTA. Then you think that there is nothing to be done--I\nshall have to be banished?\n\nKNAVE. I'm afraid--Wait, I have an idea! (_Excitedly_) Dulcinea, my\nwife--her name is Dulcinea--made known to me this morning, very\nforcibly--Yes, I remember, I'm sure--Yes, she was going to bake\nthis very morning some raspberry tarts--a dish in which she\nparticularly excels--If I could only procure some of them and\nbring them here!\n\nVIOLETTA. Oh, Knave, dearest, sweetest Knave, could you, I mean,\nwould you? Is there time? The court will return.\n\n(_They tiptoe to the door and listen stealthily._)\n\nKNAVE. I shall run as fast as I can. Don't let anyone come in\nuntil I get back, if you can help it.\n\n(_He jumps on the table, ready to go out the window._)\n\nVIOLETTA. Oh, Knave, how clever of you to think of it. It is the\ncustom for the King to grant a boon to the Queen at her\ncoronation. I shall ask that you be made Chancellor.\n\nKNAVE (_turning back_). Oh, please don't, My Lady, I implore you.\n\nVIOLETTA. Why not?\n\nKNAVE. It would give me social position, My Lady, and that I\nwould rather die than possess. Oh, how we argue about that, my\nwife and I! Dulcinea wishes to climb, and the higher she climbs,\nthe less she cooks. Should you have me made Chancellor, she would\nnever wield a spoon again.\n\nVIOLETTA (_pursing her lips_). But it doesn't seem fair, exactly.\nThink of how much I shall be indebted to her. If she enjoys\nsocial position, I might as well give her some. We have lots and\nlots of it lying around.\n\nKNAVE. She wouldn't, My Lady, she wouldn't enjoy it. Dulcinea is\na true genius, you understand, and the happiness of a genius lies\nsolely in using his gift. If she didn't cook she would be\nmiserable, although she might not be aware of it, I'm perfectly\nsure.\n\nVIOLETTA. Then I shall take all social position away from you.\nYou shall rank below the scullery maids. Do you like that better?\nHurry, please.\n\nKNAVE. Thank you, My Lady; it will suit me perfectly.\n\n(_He goes out with the tarts._ VIOLETTA _listens anxiously for a\nminute; then she takes her skirt between the tips of her fingers\nand practises in pantomime her anticipated ride on the palfrey.\nShe bows, smiles, kisses her hand, until suddenly she remembers\nthe mule standing outside the gates of the palace. That thought\nsaddens her, so she curls up in_ POMPDEBILE'S _throne and cries\nsoftly, wiping away her tears with a lace handkerchief. There is\na knock. She flies to the door and holds it shut._)\n\nVIOLETTA (_breathlessly_). Who is there?\n\nCHANCELLOR. It is I, Lady Violetta. The King wishes to return.\n\nVIOLETTA (_alarmed_). Return! Does he? But the tarts are not done.\nThey are not done at all!\n\nCHANCELLOR. You said they would be ready in twenty minutes. His\nMajesty is impatient.\n\nVIOLETTA. Did you play a game of checkers with him, Chancellor?\n\nCHANCELLOR. Yes.\n\nVIOLETTA. And did you beat him?\n\nCHANCELLOR (_shortly_). I did not.\n\nVIOLETTA (_laughing_). How sweet of you! Would you mind doing it\nagain just for me? Or would it be too great a strain on you to\nkeep from beating him twice in succession?\n\nCHANCELLOR. I shall tell the King that you refuse admission.\n\n(VIOLETTA _runs to the window to see if the_ KNAVE _is in sight. The_\nCHANCELLOR _returns and knocks._)\n\nCHANCELLOR. The King wishes to come in.\n\nVIOLETTA. But the checkers!\n\nCHANCELLOR. The Knights of the Checker Board have taken them\naway.\n\nVIOLETTA. But the tarts aren't done, really.\n\nCHANCELLOR. You said twenty minutes.\n\nVIOLETTA. No, I didn't--at least, I said twenty minutes for them\nto get good and warm and another twenty minutes for them to\nbecome brown. That makes forty--don't you remember?\n\nCHANCELLOR. I shall carry your message to His Majesty.\n\n(VIOLETTA _again runs to the window and peers anxiously up the\nroad._)\n\nCHANCELLOR (_knocking loudly_). The King commands you to open the\ndoor.\n\nVIOLETTA. Commands! Tell him--Is he there--with you?\n\nCHANCELLOR. His Majesty is at the door.\n\nVIOLETTA. Pompy, I think you are rude, very rude indeed. I don't\nsee how you can be so rude--to command me, your own Violetta who\nloves you so. (_She again looks in vain for the_ KNAVE.) Oh, dear!\n(_Wringing her hands_) Where can he be!\n\nPOMPDEBILE (_outside_). This is nonsense. Don't you see how worried\nwe are? It is a compliment to you--\n\nVIOLETTA. Well, come in; I don't care--only I'm sure they are not\nfinished.\n\n(_She opens the door for the_ KING, the CHANCELLOR, _and the two_\nPASTRY COOKS. _The_ KING _walks to his throne. He finds_ LADY\nVIOLETTA'S _lace handkerchief on it._)\n\nPOMPDEBILE (_holding up handkerchief_). What is this?\n\nVIOLETTA. Oh, that's my handkerchief.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. It is very damp. Can it be that you are anxious, that\nyou are afraid?\n\nVIOLETTA. How silly, Pompy. I washed my hands, as one always does\nafter cooking; (_to the_ PASTRY COOKS) doesn't one? But there was\nno towel, so I used my handkerchief instead of my petticoat,\nwhich is made of chiffon and is very perishable.\n\nCHANCELLOR. Is the Lady Violetta ready to produce her work?\n\nVIOLETTA. I don't understand what you mean by work, Chancellor.\nOh, the tarts! (_Nervously_) They were quite simple--quite simple\nto make--no work at all--A little imagination is all one needs\nfor such things, just imagination. You agree with me, don't you,\nPompy, that imagination will work wonders--will do almost\nanything, in fact? I remember--\n\nPOMPDEBILE. The Pastry Cooks will remove the tarts from the oven.\n\nVIOLETTA. Oh, _no_, Pompy! They are not finished or cooked,\nor whatever one calls it. They are not. The last five minutes is\nof the greatest importance. Please don't let them touch them!\n_Please_--\n\nPOMPDEBILE. There, there, my dear Violetta, calm yourself. If you\nwish, they will put them back again. There can be no harm in\nlooking at them. Come, I will hold your hand.\n\nVIOLETTA. That will help a great deal, Pompy, your holding my\nhand.\n\n(_She scrambles up on the throne beside the_ KING.)\n\nCHANCELLOR (_in horror_). On the throne, Your Majesty?\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Of course not, Chancellor. We regret that you are not\nyet entitled to sit on the throne, my dear. In a little while--\n\nVIOLETTA (_coming down_). Oh, I see. May I sit here, Chancellor, in\nthis seemingly humble position at his feet? Of course, I can't\n_really_ be humble when he is holding my hand and enjoying\nit so much.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Violetta! (_To the_ PASTRY COOKS) Sample the tarts.\nThis suspense is unbearable!\n\n(_The_ KING'S _voice is husky with excitement. The two_ PASTRY COOKS,\n_after bowing with great ceremony to the_ KING, _to each other, to\nthe_ CHANCELLOR--_for this is the most important moment of their\nlives by far--walk to the oven door and open it, impressively.\nThey fall back in astonishment so great that they lose their\nbalance, but they quickly scramble to their feet again_).\n\nYELLOW HOSE. Your Majesty, there are no tarts there!\n\nBLUE HOSE. Your Majesty, the tarts have gone!\n\nVIOLETTA (_clasping her hands_). Gone! Oh, where could they have\ngone?\n\nPOMPDEBILB (_coming down from throne_). That is impossible.\n\nPASTRY COOKS (_greatly excited_). You see, you see, the oven is\nempty as a drum.\n\nPOMPDEBILE (_to_ VIOLETTA). Did you go out of this room?\n\nVIOLETTA (_wailing_). Only for a few minutes, Pompy, to powder my\nnose before the mirror in the pantry. (_To_ PASTRY COOKS) When one\ncooks one becomes so disheveled, doesn't one? But if I had\nthought for one little minute--\n\nPOMPDEBILE (_interrupting_). The tarts have been stolen!\n\nVIOLETTA (_with a shriek, throwing herself on a chair_). Stolen!\nOh, I shall faint; help me. Oh, oh, to think that any one would\ntake my delicious little, my dear little tarts. My salts. Oh! Oh!\n\n(PASTRY COOKS _run to the door and call._)\n\nYELLOW HOSE. Salts! Bring the Lady Violetta's salts.\n\nBLUE HOSE. The Lady Violetta has fainted!\n\n(URSULA _enters hurriedly bearing a smelling-bottle._)\n\nURSULA. Here, here--What has happened? Oh, My Lady, my sweet\nmistress!\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Some wretch has stolen the tarts.\n\n(LADY VIOLETTA _moans._)\n\nURSULA. Bring some water. I will take off her headdress and bathe\nher forehead.\n\nVIOLETTA (_sitting up_). I feel better now. Where am I? What is the\nmatter? I remember. Oh, my poor tarts!\n\n(_She buries her face in her hands._)\n\nCHANCELLOR (_suspiciously_). Your Majesty, this is very strange.\n\nURSULA (_excitedly_). I know, Your Majesty. It was the Knave. One\nof the Queen's women, who was walking in the garden, saw the\nKnave jump out of this window with a tray in his hand. It was the\nKnave.\n\nVIOLETTA. Oh, I don't think it was he. I don't, really.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. The scoundrel. Of course it was he. We shall banish\nhim for this or have him _beheaded._\n\nCHANCELLOR. It should have been done long ago, Your Majesty.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. You are right.\n\nCHANCELLOR. Your Majesty will never listen to me.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. We _do_ listen to you. Be quiet.\n\nVIOLETTA. What are you going to do, Pompy, dear?\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Herald, issue a proclamation at once. Let it be known\nall over the Kingdom that I desire that the Knave be brought here\ndead or alive. Send the royal detectives and policemen in every\ndirection.\n\nCHANCELLOR. Excellent; just what I should have advised had Your\nMajesty listened to me.\n\nPOMPDEBILE (_in a rage_). Be quiet. (_Exit_ HERALD.) I never have a\nbrilliant thought but you claim it. It is insufferable!\n\n(_The_ HERALDS _can be heard in the distance._)\n\nCHANCELLOR. I resign.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Good. We accept your thirty-eighth resignation at\nonce.\n\nCHANCELLOR. You did me the honor to appoint me as your\nChancellor, Your Majesty, yet never, never do you give me an\nopportunity to chancel. That is my only grievance. You must\nadmit, Your Majesty, that as your advisers advise you, as your\ndressers dress you, as your hunters hunt, as your bakers bake,\nyour Chancellor should be allowed to chancel. However, I will be\njust--as I have been with you so long; before I leave you, I will\ngive you a month's notice.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. That isn't necessary.\n\nCHANCELLOR (_referring to the constitution hanging at his belt_).\nIt's in the constitution.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Be quiet.\n\nVIOLETTA. Well, I think as things have turned out so--so\nunfortunately, I shall change my gown. (_To_ URSULA) Put out my\ncloth of silver with the moonstones. It is always a relief to\nchange one's gown. May I have my handkerchief, Pompy? Rather a\npretty one, isn't it, Pompy? Of course you don't object to my\ncalling you Pompy now. When I'm in trouble it's a comfort, like\nholding your hand.\n\nPOMPDEBILE (_magnanimously_). You may hold our hand too, Violetta.\n\nVIOLETTA (_fervently_). Oh, how good you are, how sympathetic! But\nyou see it's impossible just now, as I have to change my\ngown--unless you will come with me while I change.\n\nCHANCELLOR (_in a voice charged with inexpressible horror_). Your\nMajesty!\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Be quiet! You have been discharged! (_He starts to\ndescend, when a_ HERALD _bursts through the door in a state of\ngreat excitement. He kneels before_ POMPDEBILE.)\n\nHERALD. We have found him; we have found him, Your Majesty. In\nfact,_I_ found him all by myself! He was sitting under the\nshrubbery eating a tart. I stumbled over one of his legs and\nfell. \"How easy it is to send man and all his pride into the\ndust,\" he said, and then--I saw him!\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Eating a tart! Eating a tart, did you say? The\nscoundrel! Bring him here immediately.\n\n(_The_ HERALD _rushes out and returns with the_ KNAVE, _followed\nby the six little_ PAGES. _The_ KNAVE _carries a tray of tarts in\nhis hand._)\n\nPOMPDEBILE (_almost speechless with rage_). How dare\nyou--you--you--\n\nKNAVE (_bowing_). Knave, Your Majesty.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. You Knave, you shall be punished for this.\n\nCHANCELLOR. Behead him, Your Majesty.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Yes, behead him at once.\n\nVIOLETTA. Oh, no, Pompy, not that! It is not severe enough.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Not severe enough, to cut off a man's head! Really,\nVioletta--\n\nVIOLETTA. No, because, you see, when one has been beheaded, one's\nconsciousness that one has been beheaded comes off too. It is\ninevitable. And then, what does it matter, when one doesn't know?\nLet us think of something really cruel--really fiendish. I have\nit--deprive him of social position for the rest of his life--force\nhim to remain a mere knave, forever.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. You are right.\n\nKNAVE. Terrible as this punishment is, I admit that I deserve it,\nYour Majesty.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. What prompted you to commit this dastardly crime?\n\nKNAVE. All my life I have had a craving for tarts of any kind.\nThere is something in my nature that demands tarts--something in\nmy constitution that cries out for them--and I obey my\nconstitution as rigidly as does the Chancellor seek to obey his.\nI was in the garden reading, as is my habit, when a delicate odor\nfloated to my nostrils, a persuasive odor, a seductive, light\nbrown, flaky odor, an odor so enticing, so suggestive of tarts\nfit for the gods--- that I could stand it no longer. It was\nstronger than I. With one gesture I threw reputation, my chances\nfor future happiness, to the winds, and leaped through the\nwindow. The odor led me to the oven; I seized a tart, and, eating\nit, experienced the one perfect moment of my existence. After\nhaving eaten that one tart, my craving for other tarts has\ndisappeared. I shall live with the memory of that first tart\nbefore me forever, or die content, having tasted true perfection.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. M-m-m, how extraordinary! Let him be beaten fifteen\nstrokes on the back. Now, Pastry Cooks to the Royal Household, we\nawait your decision!\n\n(_The_ COOKS _bow as before; then each selects a tart from the\ntray on the table, lifts it high, then puts it in his mouth. An\nexpression of absolute ecstasy and beatitude comes over their\nfaces. They clasp hands, then fall on each other's necks,\nweeping._)\n\nPOMPDEBILE (_impatiently_). What on earth is the matter?\n\nYELLOW HOSE. Excuse our emotion. It is because we have at last\nencountered a true genius, a great master, or rather mistress, of\nour art.\n\n(_They bow to_ VIOLETTA.)\n\nPOMPDEBILE. They are good, then?\n\nBLUE HOSE (_his eyes to heaven_). Good! They are angelic!\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Give one of the tarts to us. We would sample it.\n\n(_The_ PASTRY COOKS _hand the tray to the KING, who selects a\ntart and eats it._)\n\nPOMPDEBILE (_to_ VIOLETTA). My dear, they are marvels! marvels!\n(_He comes down from the throne and leads_ VIOLETTA _up to the\ndais._) Your throne, my dear.\n\nVIOLETTA (_sitting down, with a sigh_). I'm glad it's such a\ncomfortable one.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Knave, we forgive your offense. The temptation was\nvery great. There are things that mere human nature cannot be\nexpected to resist. Another tart, Cooks, and yet another!\n\nCHANCELLOR. But, Your Majesty, don't eat them all. They must go\nto the museum with the dishes of the previous Queens of Hearts.\n\nYELLOW HOSE. A museum--those tarts! As well lock a rose in a\nmoney-box!\n\nCHANCELLOR. But the constitution commands it. How else can we\ncommemorate, for future generations, this event?\n\nKNAVE. An Your Majesty, please, I will commemorate it in a rhyme.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. How can a mere rhyme serve to keep this affair in the\nminds of the people?\n\nKNAVE. It is the only way to keep it in the minds of the people.\nNo event is truly deathless unless its monument be built in\nrhyme. Consider that fall which, though insignificant in itself,\nbecame the most famous of all history, because someone happened\nto put it into rhyme. The crash of it sounded through centuries\nand will vibrate for generations to come.\n\nVIOLETTA. You mean the fall of the Holy Roman Empire?\n\nKNAVE. No, Madam, I refer to the fall of Humpty Dumpty.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Well, make your rhyme. In the meantime let us\ncelebrate. You may all have one tart. (_The_ PASTRY COOKS _pass\nthe tarts. To_ VIOLETTA) Are you willing, dear, to ride the white\npalfrey garlanded with flowers through the streets of the city?\n\nVIOLETTA. Willing! I have been practising for days!\n\nPOMPDEBILE. The people, I suppose, are still clamoring at the\ngates.\n\nVIOLETTA. Oh, yes, they must clamor. I _want_ them to. Herald,\ntell them that to every man I shall toss a flower, to every woman\na shining gold piece, but to the babies I shall throw only\nkisses, thousands of them, like little winged birds. Kisses and\ngold and roses! They will surely love me then!\n\nCHANCELLOR. Your Majesty, I protest. Of what possible use to the\npeople--?\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Be quiet. The Queen may scatter what she pleases.\n\nKNAVE. My rhyme is ready, Your Majesty.\n\nPOMPDEBILE. Repeat it.\n\nKNAVE.\n\n  The Queen of Hearts\n  She made some tarts\n  All on a summer's day.\n  The Knave of Hearts\n  He stole those tarts\n  And took them quite away.\n\n  The King of Hearts\n  Called for those tarts\n  And beat the Knave full sore.\n  The Knave of Hearts\n  Brought back the tarts\n  And vowed he'd sin no more.\n\nVIOLETTA (_earnestly_). My dear Knave, how wonderful of you! You\nshall be Poet Laureate. A Poet Laureate has no social position,\nhas he?\n\nKNAVE. It depends, Your Majesty, upon whether or not he chooses\nto be more laureate than poet.\n\nVIOLETTA (_rising, her eyes closed in ecstasy_). _Your\nMajesty!_ Those words go to my head--like wine!\n\nKNAVE. Long live Pompdebile the Eighth, and Queen Violetta!\n\n(_The trumpets sound._)\n\nHERALDS. Make way for Pompdebile the Eighth, and Queen Violetta!\n\nVIOLETTA (_excitedly_). _Vee_-oletta, please!\n\nHERALDS. Make way for Pompdebile the Eighth, and Queen\n_Vee_-oletta--\n\n(_The_ KING _and_ QUEEN _show themselves at the door--and the people\ncan be heard clamoring outside._)\n\n                        [CURTAIN]\n\n\n\n\nFAME AND THE POET[1]\n\nLord Dunsany\n\n[Footnote 1: Reprinted from the _Atlantic Monthly_ for June,\n1919, by special permission of Lord Dunsany and the editors of\nthe _Atlantic Monthly._]\n\nSCENE: The Poet's rooms in London. Windows in back. A high screen\nin a corner.\n\nTIME: February 30th.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nHARRY DE REVES.--A Poet.\n\n(_This name, though of course of French origin, has become\nanglicized and is pronounced_ DE REEVES.)\n\nDICK PRATTLE.--A Lieutenant-Major of the Royal Horse Marines.\n\nFAME.\n\n\n(_The_ POET _is sitting at a table, writing. Enter_ DICK PRATTLE.)\n\nPRATTLE. Hullo, Harry.\n\nDE REVES. Hullo, Dick. Good Lord, where are you from?\n\nPRATTLE (_casually_). The ends of the Earth.\n\nDE REVES. Well, I'm damned!\n\nPRATTLE. Thought I'd drop in and see how you were getting on.\n\nDE REVES. Well, that's splendid. What are you doing in London?\n\nPRATTLE. Well, I wanted to see if I could get one or two decent\nties to wear,--you can get nothing out there,--then I thought\nI'd have a look and see how London was getting on.\n\nDE REVES. Splendid! How's everybody?\n\nPRATTLE. All going strong.\n\nDE REVES. That's good.\n\nPRATTLE. (_seeing paper and ink_). But what are you doing?\n\nDE REVES. Writing.\n\nPRATTLE. Writing? I didn't know you wrote.\n\nDE REVES. Yes, I've taken to it rather.\n\nPRATTLE. I say--writing's no good. What do you write?\n\nDE REVES. Oh, poetry.\n\nPRATTLE. Poetry? Good Lord!\n\nDE REVES. Yes, that sort of thing, you know.\n\nPRATTLE. Good Lord! Do you make any money by it?\n\nDE REVES. No. Hardly any.\n\nPRATTLE. I say--why don't you chuck it?\n\nDE REVES. Oh, I don't know. Some people seem to like my stuff,\nrather. That's why I go on.\n\nPRATTLE. I'd chuck it if there's no money in it.\n\nDE REVES. Ah, but then it's hardly in your line, is it? You'd\nhardly approve of poetry if there _was_ money in it.\n\nPRATTLE. Oh, I don't say that. If I could make as much by poetry\nas I can by betting I don't say I wouldn't try the poetry touch,\nonly--\n\nDE REVES. Only what?\n\nPRATTLE. Oh, I don't know. Only there seems more sense in\nbetting, somehow.\n\nDE REVES. Well, yes. I suppose it's easier to tell what an\nearthly horse is going to do, than to tell what Pegasus--\n\nPRATTLE. What's Pegasus?\n\nDE REVES. Oh, the winged horse of poets.\n\nPRATTLE. I say! You don't believe in a winged horse, do you?\n\nDE REVES. In our trade we believe in all fabulous things. They\nall represent some large truth to turn us. An emblem like Pegasus\nis as real a thing to a poet as a Derby winner would be to you.\n\nPRATTLE. I say. (_Give me a cigarette. Thanks._) What? Then you'd\nbelieve in nymphs and fauns, and Pan, and all those kind of\nbirds?\n\nDE REVES. Yes. Yes. In all of them.\n\nPRATTLE. Good Lord!\n\nDE REVES. You believe in the Lord Mayor of London, don't you?\n\nPRATTLE. Yes, of course; but what has--\n\nDE REVES. Four million people or so made him Lord Mayor, didn't\nthey? And he represents to them the wealth and dignity and\ntradition of--\n\nPRATTLE. Yes; but, I say, what has all this--\n\nDE REVES. Well, he stands for an idea to them, and they made him\nLord Mayor, and so he is one....\n\nPRATTLE. Well, of course he is.\n\nDE REVES. In the same way Pan has been made what he is by\nmillions; by millions to whom he represents world-old traditions.\n\nPRATTLE. (_rising from his chair and stepping backwards, laughing\nand looking at the POET in a kind of assumed wonder_). I say.... I\nsay.... You old heathen ... but Good Lord....\n\n(_He bumps into the high screen behind, pushing it back a little._)\n\nDE REVES. Look out! Look out!\n\nPRATTLE. What? What's the matter?\n\nDE REVES. The screen!\n\nPRATTLE. Oh, sorry, yes. I'll put it right.\n\n(_He is about to go round behind it._)\n\nDE REVES. No, don't go round there.\n\nPRATTLE. What? Why not?\n\nDE REVES. Oh, you wouldn't understand.\n\nPRATTLE. Wouldn't understand? Why, what have you got?\n\nDE REVES. Oh, one of those things.... You wouldn't understand.\n\nPRATTLE. Of course I'd understand. Let's have a look. (_The_ POET\n_walks toward_ PRATTLE _and the screen. He protests no further._\nPRATTLE _looks round the corner of the screen._) An altar.\n\nDE REVES. (_removing the screen altogether_). That is all. What do\nyou make of it?\n\n(_An altar of Greek design, shaped like a pedestal, is revealed.\nPapers litter the floor all about it._)\n\nPRATTLE. I say--you always were an untidy devil.\n\nDE REVES. Well, what do you make of it?\n\nPRATTLE. It reminds me of your room at Eton.\n\nDE REVES. My room at Eton?\n\nPRATTLE. Yes, you always had papers all over your floor.\n\nDE REVES. Oh, yes--\n\nPRATTLE. And what are these?\n\nDE REVES. All these are poems; and this is my altar to Fame.\n\nPRATTLE. To Fame?\n\nDE REVES. The same that Homer knew.\n\nPRATTLE. Good Lord!\n\nDE REVES. Keats never saw her. Shelley died too young. She came\nlate at the best of times, now scarcely ever.\n\nPRATTLE. But, my dear fellow, you don't mean that you think there\nreally is such a person?\n\nDE REVES. I offer all my songs to her.\n\nPRATTLE. But you don't mean you think you could actually\n_see_ Fame?\n\nDE REVES. We poets personify abstract things, and not poets only\nbut sculptors and painters too. All the great things of the world\nare those abstract things.\n\nPRATTLE. But what I mean is they're not really there, like you or\nme.\n\nDE REVES. To us these things are more real than men, they outlive\ngenerations, they watch the passing of Kingdoms: we go by them\nlike dust; they are still here, unmoved, unsmiling.\n\nPRATTLE. But, but, you can't think that you could _see_\nFame, you don't expect to _see_ it.\n\nDE REVES. Not to me. Never to me. She of the golden trumpet and\nGreek dress will never appear to me.... We all have our dreams.\n\nPRATTLE. I say--what have you been doing all day?\n\nDE REVES. I? Oh, only writing a sonnet.\n\nPRATTLE. Is it a long one?\n\nDE REVES. Not very.\n\nPRATTLE. About how long is it?\n\nDE REVES. About fourteen lines.\n\nPRATTLE (_impressively_). I tell you what it is.\n\nDE REVES. Yes?\n\nPRATTLE. I tell you what. You've been overworking yourself. I\nonce got like that on board the Sandhurst, working for the\npassing-out exam. I got so bad that I could have seen anything.\n\nDE REVES. Seen anything?\n\nPRATTLE. Lord, yes: horned pigs, snakes with wings, anything, one\nof your winged horses even. They gave me some stuff called\nbromide for it. You take a rest.\n\nDE REVES. But my dear fellow, you don't understand at all. I\nmerely said that abstract things are to a poet as near and real\nand visible as one of your bookmakers or barmaids.\n\nPRATTLE. I know. You take a rest.\n\nDE REVES. Well, perhaps I will. I'd come with you to that musical\ncomedy you're going to see, only I'm a bit tired after writing\nthis; it's a tedious job. I'll come another night.\n\nPRATTLE. How do you know I'm going to see a musical comedy?\n\nDE REVES. Well, where would you go? _Hamlet's_ on at the\nLord Chamberlain's. You're not going there.\n\nPBATTLE. Do I look like it?\n\nDE REVES. No.\n\nPRATTLE. Well, you're quite right. I'm going to see \"The Girl\nfrom Bedlam.\" So long. I must push off now. It's getting late.\nYou take a rest. Don't add another line to that sonnet;\nfourteen's quite enough. You take a rest. Don't have any dinner\nto-night, just rest. I was like that once myself. So long.\n\nDE REVES. So long.\n\n(_Exit_ PRATTLE. DE REVES _returns to his table and sits down._)\n\nGood old Dick. He's the same as ever. Lord, how time passes.\n\n(_He takes his pen and his sonnet and makes a few alterations._)\n\nWell, that's finished. I can't do any more to it.\n\n(_He rises and goes to the screen; he draws back part of it and\ngoes up to the altar. He is about to place his sonnet reverently\nat the foot of the altar amongst his other verses._)\n\nNo, I will not put it there. This one is worthy of the altar.\n\n(_He places the sonnet upon the altar itself._)\n\nIf that sonnet does not give me Fame, nothing that I have done\nbefore will give it to me, nothing that I ever will do.\n\n(_He replaces the screen and returns to his chair at the table.\nTwilight is coming on. He sits with his elbow on the table, his\nhead on his hand, or however the actor pleases._)\n\nWell, well. Fancy seeing Dick again. Well, Dick enjoys his life,\nso he's no fool. What was that he said? \"There's no money in\npoetry. You'd better chuck it.\" Ten years' work and what have I\nto show for it? The admiration of men who care for poetry, and\nhow many of _them_ are there? There's a bigger demand for\nsmoked glasses to look at eclipses of the sun. Why should Fame\ncome to me? Haven't I given up my days for her? That is enough to\nkeep her away. I am a poet; that is enough reason for her to\nslight me. Proud and aloof and cold as marble, what does Fame\ncare for us? Yes, Dick is right. It's a poor game chasing\nillusions, hunting the intangible, pursuing dreams. Dreams? Why,\nwe are ourselves dreams. (_He leans back in his chair._)\n\n                       We are such stuff\n  As dreams are made on, and our little life\n  Is rounded with a sleep.\n\n(_He is silent for a while. Suddenly he lifts his head_)\n\nMy room at Eton, Dick said. An untidy mess.\n\n(_As he lifts his head and says these words, twilight gives place\nto broad daylight, merely as a hint that the author of the play\nmay have been mistaken, and the whole thing may have been no more\nthan a poet's dream._)\n\nSo it was, and it's an untidy mess there (_looking at screen_) too.\nDick's right. I'll tidy it up. I'll burn the whole damned heap.\n(_He advances impetuously toward the screen_) Every damned poem\nthat I was ever fool enough to waste my time on.\n\n(_He pushes back the screen._ FAME _in a Greek dress with a long\ngolden trumpet in her hand is seen standing motionless on the\naltar like a marble goddess._)\n\nSo ... you have come!\n\n(_For a while he stands thunderstruck. Then he approaches the\naltar._)\n\nDivine fair lady, you have come.\n\n(_He holds up his hands to her and leads her down from the altar\nand into the centre of the stage. At whatever moment the actor\nfinds it most convenient, he repossesses himself of the sonnet\nthat he had placed on the altar. He now offers it to_ FAME.)\n\nThis is my sonnet. Is it well done?\n\n(FAME _takes it, reads it in silence, while the_ POET _watches her\nrapturously._)\n\nFAME. You're a bit of all right.\n\nDE REVES. What?\n\nFAME. Some poet.\n\nDE REVES. I--I--scarcely ... understand.\n\nFAME. You're IT.\n\nDE REVES. But ... it is not possible ... are you she that knew Homer?\n\nFAME. Homer? Lord, yes. Blind old bat, 'e couldn't see a yard.\n\nDE REVES. O Heavens!\n\n(FAME _walks beautifully to the window. She opens it and puts her\nhead out._)\n\nFAME (_in a voice with which a woman in an upper story would cry\nfor help if the house was well alight_). Hi! Hi! Boys! Hi! Say,\nfolks! Hi!\n\n(_The murmur of a gathering crowd is heard._ FAME _blows her\ntrumpet._)\n\nFAME. Hi, he's a poet. (_Quickly, over her shoulder._) What's your\nname?\n\nDE REVES. De Reves.\n\nFAME. His name's de Reves.\n\nDE REVES. Harry de Reves.\n\nFAME. His pals call him Harry.\n\nTHE CROWD. Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!\n\nFAME. Say, what's your favourite color?\n\nDE REVES. I ... I ... I don't quite understand.\n\nFAME. Well, which do you like best, green or blue?\n\nDE REVES. Oh--er--blue. (_She blows her trumpet out of the\nwindow._) No--er--I think green.\n\nFAME. Green is his favourite colour.\n\nTHE CROWD. Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!\n\nFAME. 'Ere, tell us something. They want to know all about yer.\n\nDE REVES; Wouldn't you perhaps ... would they care to hear my\nsonnet, if you would--er....\n\nFAME (_picking up quill_). Here, what's this?\n\nDE REVES. Oh, that's my pen.\n\nFAME (_after another blast on her trumpet_). He writes with a\nquill. (_Cheers from_ THE CROWD.)\n\nFAME (_going to a cupboard_). Here, what have you got in here?\n\nDE REVES. Oh ... er ... those are my breakfast things.\n\nFAME (_finding a dirty plate_). What have yer had on this one?\n\nDE REVES (_mournfully_). Oh, eggs and bacon.\n\nFAME (_at the window_). He has eggs and bacon for breakfast.\n\nTHE CROWD. Hip hip hip _hooray!_ Hip hip hip _hooray!_\nHip hip hip _hooray!_\n\nFAME. Hi, and what's this?\n\nDE REVES (_miserably_). Oh, a golf stick.\n\nFAME. He's a man's man! He's a virile man! He's a manly man!\n\n(_Wild cheers from_ THE CROWD, _this time only from women's voices._)\n\nDE REVES. Oh, this is terrible. This is terrible. This is\nterrible.\n\n(FAME _gives another peal on her horn. She is about to speak._)\n\nDE REVES (_solemnly and mournfully_). One moment, one moment....\n\nFAME. Well, out with it.\n\nDE REVES. For ten years, divine lady, I have worshipped you,\noffering all my songs ... I find ... I find I am not worthy....\n\nFAME. Oh, you're all right.\n\nDE REVES. No, no, I am not worthy. It cannot be. It cannot\npossibly be. Others deserve you more. I must say it! _I cannot\npossibly love you._ Others are worthy. You will find others.\nBut I, no, no, no. It cannot be. It cannot be. Oh, pardon me, but\nit _must_ not.\n\n(_Meanwhile_ FAME _has been lighting one of his cigarettes. She sits\nin a comfortable chair, leans right back, and puts her feet right\nup on the table amongst the poet's papers._)\n\nOh, I fear I offend you. But--it cannot be.\n\nFAME. Oh, that's all right, old bird; no offence. I ain't going\nto leave you.\n\nDE REVES. But--but--but--I do not understand.\n\nFAME. I've come to stay, I have.\n\n(_She blows a puff of smoke through her trumpet._)\n\n                        [CURTAIN]\n\n\n\n\nTHE CAPTAIN OF THE GATE[1]\n\nBeulah Marie Dix\n\n\nSCENE: In the cheerless hour before the dawn of a wet spring\nmorning five gentlemen-troopers of the broken Royalist army,\nfagged and outworn with three long days of siege, are holding,\nwith what strength and courage are left them, the Gatehouse of\nthe Bridge of Cashala, which is the key to the road that leads\ninto Connaught. The upper chamber of the Gatehouse, in which they\nmake their stand, is a narrow, dim-lit apartment, built of stone.\nAt one side is a small fireplace, and beside it a narrow, barred\ndoor, which leads to the stairhead. At the end of the room,\ngained by a single raised step, are three slit-like windows,\nbreast-high, designed, as now used, for defense in time of war.\nThe room is meagrely furnished, with a table on which are\npowder-flask, touch-box, etc., for charging guns, a stool or two,\nand an open keg of powder. The whole look of the place, bare and\nmartial, but depressed, bespeaks a losing fight. On the hearth\nthe ashes of a fire are white, and on the chimneypiece a brace of\ncandles are guttering out.\n\nThe five men who hold the Gatehouse wear much soiled and torn\nmilitary dress. They are pale, powder-begrimed, sunken-eyed, with\nevery mark of weariness of body and soul. Their leader, JOHN\nTALBOT, is standing at one of the shot-windows, with piece\npresented, looking forth. He is in his mid-twenties, of\nNorman-Irish blood, and distinctly of a finer, more nervous type\nthan his companions. He has been wounded, and bears his left hand\nwrapped in a bloody rag. DICK FENTON, a typical, careless young\nEnglish swashbuckler, sits by the table, charging a musket, and\nsinging beneath his breath as he does so. He, too, has been\nwounded, and bears a bandage about his knee. Upon the floor (_at\nright_) KIT NEWCOMBE lies in the sleep of utter exhaustion. He is\nan English lad, in his teens, a mere tired, haggard child, with\nhis head rudely bandaged. On a stool by the hearth sits MYLES\nBUTLER, a man of JOHN TALBOT'S own years, but a slower, heavier,\nalmost sullen type. Beside him kneels PHELIMY DRISCOLL, a\nnervous, dark Irish lad, of one and twenty. He is resting his\ninjured arm across BUTLER'S knee, and BUTLER is roughly bandaging\nthe hurt.\n\nFor a moment there is a weary, heavy silence, in which the words\nof the song which FENTON sings are audible. It is the doleful old\nstrain of \"the hanging-tune.\"\n\n[Footnote 1: Included by permission of the author and of Messrs.\nHenry Holt and Company, the publishers, from the volume\n_Allison's Lad and Other Martial Interludes._ (1910).]\n\nFENTON (_singing_).\n\nFortune, my foe, why dost thou frown on me,\nAnd will thy favors never greater be?\nWilt thou, I say, forever breed me pain,\nAnd wilt thou not restore my joys again?\n\nBUTLER (_shifting_ DRISCOLL'S _arm, none too tenderly_). More to the\nlight!\n\nDRISCOLL (_catching breath with pain_). Ah! Softly, Myles!\n\nJOHN TALBOT (_leaning forward tensely_). Ah!\n\nFENTON. Jack! Jack Talbot! What is it that you see?\n\nJOHN TALBOT (_with the anger of a man whose nerves are strained\nalmost beyond endurance_). What should I see but Cromwell's\nwatch-fires along the boreen? What else should I see, and the\nnight as black as the mouth of hell? What else should I see, and\na pest choke your throat with your fool's questions, Dick Fenton!\n\n(_Resumes his watch._)\n\nFENTON (_as who should say: \"I thank you!\"_). God 'a'\nmercy--_Captain_ Talbot!\n\n(_Resumes his singing._)\n\nDRISCOLL. God's love! I bade ye have a care, Myles Butler.\n\nBUTLEK (_tying the last bandage_). It's a stout heart you have in\nyou, Phelimy Driscoll--you to be crying out for a scratch. It's\nbetter you would have been, you and the like of you, to be\nstopping at home with your mother.\n\n(_Rises and takes up his musket from the corner by the fireplace._)\n\nDRISCOLL. You--you dare--you call me--coward? Ye black liar! I'll\nlesson ye! I'll--\n\n(_Tries to rise, but in the effort sways weakly forward and rests\nwith his head upon the stool which_ BUTLER _has quitted._)\n\nBUTLER. A'Heaven's name, ha' done with that hanging tune! Ha'\ndone, Dick Fenton! We're not yet at the gallows' foot.\n\n(_Joins_ JOHN TALBOT _at the shot-windows._)\n\nFENTON. Nay, Myles, for us 'tis like to be nothing half so merry\nas the gallows.\n\nBUTLER. Hold your fool's tongue!\n\nNEWCOMBE (_crying out in his sleep_). Oh! Oh!\n\nJOHN TALBOT. What was that?\n\nFENTON. 'Twas naught but young Newcombe that cried out in the\nclutch of a nightmare.\n\nBUTLER. 'Tis time Kit Newcombe rose and stood his watch.\n\nJOHN TALBOT (_leaving the window_). Nay, 'tis only a boy. Let him\nsleep while he can! Let him sleep!\n\nBUTLER. Turn and turn at the watch, 'tis but fair. Stir yonder\nsluggard awake, Dick!\n\nFENTON. Aye. (_Starts to rise._)\n\nJOHN TALBOT. Who gives commands here? Sit you down, Fenton! To\nyour place, Myles Butler!\n\nBUTLER. Captain of the Gate! D'ye mark the high tone of him,\nDick?\n\nJOHN TALBOT (_tying a fresh bandage about his hand_). You're out\nthere, Myles. There is but one Captain of the Gate of\nConnaught--he who set me here--my cousin, Hugh Talbot.\n\nBUTLER (_muttering_). Aye, and it's a deal you'll need to be\ngrowing, ere you fill Hugh Talbot's shoes.\n\nJOHN TALBOT. And that's a true word! But 'twas Hugh Talbot's will\nthat I should command, here at the Bridge of Cashala. And as long\nas breath is in me I--\n\nDRISCOLL (_raising his head heavily_). Water! Water! Myles! Dick!\nWill ye give me to drink, lads? Jack Talbot! I'm choked wi'\nthirst.\n\nJOHN TALBOT. There's never a drop of water left us, Phelimy, lad.\n\nFENTON. Owen Bourke drained the last of it, God rest him!\n\nBUTLER. 'Tis likely our clever new Captain of the Gate will hit\non some shift to fill our empty casks.\n\n(DRISCOLL _rises heavily._)\n\nJOHN TALBOT. Not the new Captain of the Gate. The old Captain of\nthe Gate--Hugh Talbot. He'll be here this day--this hour, maybe.\n\nFENTON. That tale grows something old, Jack Talbot.\n\nJOHN TALBOT. He swore he'd bring us succor. He--\n\n(DRISCOLL _tries to unbar the exit door._)\n\nDriscoll! Are you gone mad? Stand you back from that door!\n\n(_Thrusts_ DRISCOLL _from the door._)\n\nDRISCOLL (_half delirious_). Let me forth! The spring--'tis just\nbelow--there on the river-bank! Let me slip down to it--but a\nmoment--and drink!\n\nJOHN TALBOT. Cromwell's soldiers hold the spring.\n\nDRISCOLL. I care not! Let me forth and drink! Let me forth!\n\nJOHN TALBOT. 'T would be to your death.\n\nBUTLER. And what will he get but his death if he stay here,\nCaptain Talbot?\n\nDRISCOLL (_struggling with_ JOHN TALBOT). I'm choked! I'm choked, I\ntell ye! Let me go, Jack Talbot! Let me go!\n\nNEWCOMBE (_still half-asleep, rises to his knees, with a terrible\ncry, and his groping hands upthrust to guard his head_). God's\npity! No! no! no!\n\nDRISCOLL (_shocked into sanity, staggers back, crossing himself_).\nGod shield us!\n\nBUTLER. Silence that whelp!\n\nFENTON. Clear to the rebel camp they'll hear him!\n\nJOHN TALBOT (_catching_ NEWCOMBE _by the shoulder_). Newcombe! Kit\nNewcombe!\n\nNEWCOMBE. Ah, God! Keep them from me! Keep them from me!\n\nJOHN TALBOT. Ha' done! Ha' done!\n\nNEWCOMBE. Not that! Not the butt of the muskets! Not that! Not\nthat!\n\nJOHN TALBOT (_stifling_ NEWCOMBE'S _outcry with a hand upon his\nmouth_). Wake! You're dreaming!\n\nDRISCOLL. 'Tis ill luck! 'Tis ill luck comes of such dreaming!\n\nNEWCOMBE. Drogheda! I dreamed I was at Drogheda, where my\nbrother--my brother--they beat out his brains--Cromwell's\nmen--with their clubbed muskets--they--\n\n(_Clings shuddering to_ JOHN TALBOT.)\n\nFENTON. English officers that serve amongst the Irish--'t is thus\nthat Cromwell uses them!\n\nBUTLER. English officers--aye, like ourselves!\n\nJOHN TALBOT. Be quiet, Kit! You're far from Drogheda--here at\nthe Bridge of Cashala.\n\nBUTLER. Aye, safe in Cashala Gatehouse, with five hundred of\nCromwell's men sitting down before it.\n\nJOHN TALBOT. Keep your watch, Butler!\n\nNEWCOMBE. You give orders? You still command, Jack? Where's\nCaptain Talbot, then?\n\n(_Snatches up his sword and rises._)\n\nBUTLER (_quitting the window_). Aye, where _is_ Captain\nTalbot?\n\nJOHN TALBOT. You say--\n\nFENTON (_rising_). We all say it.\n\nJOHN TALBOT. Even thou, Dick?\n\nDRISCOLL. He does not come! Hugh Talbot does not come!\n\nFENTON. He bade us hold the bridge one day. We've held it three\ndays now.\n\nBUTLER. And where is Hugh Talbot with the aid he promised?\n\nJOHN TALBOT. He promised. He has never broken faith. He will\nbring us aid.\n\nFENTON. Aye, if he be living!\n\nDRISCOLL. Living? You mean that he--Och, he's dead! Hugh Talbot's\ndead! And we're destroyed! We're destroyed!\n\nNEWCOMBE (_cowering_). The butt of the muskets!\n\nFENTON. God!\n\n(_Deliberately_ BUTLER _lays down his musket._)\n\nJOHN TALBOT. Take up your piece!\n\nBUTLER. Renounce me if I do!\n\nFENTON. I stand with you, Myles Butler. Make terms for us, John\nTalbot, or, on my soul, we'll make them for ourselves.\n\nJOHN TALBOT. Surrender?\n\nNEWCOMBE. Will Cromwell spare us, an we yield ourselves now? Will\nhe spare us? Will he--\n\nFENTON. 'Tis our one chance.\n\nNEWCOMBE. Give me that white rag!\n\n(_Crosses and snatches a bandage from chimneypiece._)\n\nFENTON (_drawing his ramrod_). Here's a staff!\n\n(_Together FENTON and NEWCOMBE make ready a flag of truce._)\n\nJOHN TALBOT (_struggling with_ BUTLER _and_ DRISCOLL). A black curse\non you!\n\nBUTLER. We'll not be butchered like oxen in the shambles!\n\nJOHN TALBOT. Your oaths!\n\nBUTLER. We'll not fight longer to be knocked on the head at the\nlast.\n\nNEWCOMBE. No! No! Not that! Out with the flag, Dick!\n\nFENTON. A light here at the grating!\n\n(NEWCOMBE _turns to take a candle, obedient to_ FENTON'S _order. At\nthat moment, close at hand, a bugle sounds._)\n\nJOHN TALBOT. Hark!\n\nDRISCOLL. The bugle! They're upon us!\n\nBUTLER (_releasing his hold on_ JOHN TALBOT). What was that?\n\nJOHN TALBOT. You swore to hold the bridge.\n\nBUTLER. Swore to hold it one day. We've held it three days now.\n\nFENTON. And the half of us are slain.\n\nNEWCOMBE. And we've no water--and no food!\n\nJOHN TALBOT (_pointing to the powder-keg_). We have powder in\nplenty.\n\nDRISCOLL. We can't drink powder. Ah, for God's love, be swift,\nDick Fenton! Be swift!\n\nJOHN TALBOT. You shall not show that white flag!\n\n(_Starts toward_ FENTON, _hand on sword._)\n\nBUTLER (_pinioning_ JOHN TALBOT). God's death! We shall! Help me\nhere, Phelimy!\n\nJOHN TALBOT. A summons to parley. What see you, Fenton?\n\nFENTON (_at the shot-window_). Torches coming from the boreen, and\na white flag beneath them. I can see the faces. (_With a cry_)\nLook, Jack! A'God's name! Look!\n\n(JOHN TALBOT _springs to the window._)\n\nDRISCOLL. What is it you're seeing?\n\nFENTON. It _is_--\n\nJOHN TALBOT (_turning from the window_). 'Tis Hugh Talbot comes!\n'Tis the Captain of the Gate!\n\nBUTLER. With them? A prisoner?\n\nJOHN TALBOT. No, no! No prisoner! He wears his sword.\n\n(BUTLER _snatches up his piece and resumes watch._)\n\nFENTON. Then he'll have made terms with them! Terms!\n\nNEWCOMBE (_embracing_ DRISCOLL). Terms for us! Terms for us!\n\nJOHN TALBOT. I told ye truth. He has come. Hugh Talbot has come.\n\n(_Goes to door._)\n\nHUGH TALBOT (_speaks outside_). Open! I come alone, and in peace.\nOpen unto me!\n\nJOHN TALBOT. Who goes there?\n\nHUGH TALBOT (_outside_). The Captain of the Gate!\n\n(JOHN TALBOT _unbars the door, and bars it again upon the entrance\nof_ HUGH TALBOT. _The latter comes slowly into the room. He is a\nman in his late thirties, a tall, martial figure, clad in\nmuch-worn velvet and leather, with sword at side. The five salute\nhim as he enters._)\n\nHUGH TALBOT (_halts and for a moment surveys his followers_). Well,\nlads?\n\n(_The five stand trembling on the edge of a nervous break, unable\nfor the moment to speak._)\n\nNEWCOMBE. We thought--we thought--that you--that you--\n\n(_Breaks into childish sobbing._)\n\nFENTON. What terms will they grant us, sir?\n\nJOHN TALBOT. Sir, we have held the bridge.\n\nHUGH TALBOT. You five--\n\nJOHN TALBOT. Bourke is dead, sir, and Tregarris, and Langdale,\nand--and James Talbot, my brother.\n\nDRISCOLL. And we've had no water, sir, these many hours.\n\nHUGH TALBOT. So! You're wounded, Phelimy.\n\nDRISCOLL. 'Tis not worth heeding, sir.\n\nHUGH TALBOT. Kit! Kit! (_At the voice_ NEWCOMBE _pulls himself\ntogether._) A light here! Dick, you've your pouch under your hand?\n\nFENTON. 'Tis here, sir.\n\n(_Offers his tobacco pouch._)\n\nHUGH TALBOT (_filling his pipe_). Leave the window, Myles! They've\npromised us a half hour's truce--and Cromwell's a man of his\nword.\n\nNEWCOMBE (_bringing a lighted candle_). He'll let us pass free now,\nsir, will he not?\n\nHUGH TALBOT (_lighting his pipe at the candle_). You're not afraid,\nKit?\n\nNEWCOMBE. I? Faith, no, sir. No! Not now!\n\nHUGH TALBOT. Sit ye down, Phelimy, lad! You look dead on your\nfeet. Give me to see that arm! (_As_ HUGH TALBOT _starts toward_\nDRISCOLL, _his eye falls on the open keg of powder. He draws back\nhastily, covering his lighted pipe._) Jack Talbot! Who taught ye\nto leave your powder uncovered, where lighted match was laid?\n\nBUTLER. My blame, sir.\n\n(_Covers the keg._)\n\nJOHN TALBOT. We opened the keg, and then--\n\nFENTON. Truth, we did not cover it again, being somewhat pressed\nfor time.\n\n(_The five laugh, half hysterically._)\n\nHUGH TALBOT (_sitting by fire_). And you never thought, maybe, that\nin that keg there was powder enough to blow the bridge of Cashala\nto hell?\n\nJOHN TALBOT. It seemed a matter of small moment, sir.\n\nHUGH TALBOT. Small moment! Powder enough, put case ye set it\nthere, at the stairhead--d'ye follow me?--powder enough to make\nan end of Cashala Bridge for all time--aye, and of all within the\nGatehouse. You never thought on that, eh?\n\nJOHN TALBOT. We had so much to think on, sir.\n\nHUGH TALBOT. I did suspect as much. So I came hither to recall\nthe powder to your minds.\n\nDRISCOLL. We thought--(BUTLER _motions him to be silent._) We\nthought maybe you would not be coming at all, sir. Maybe you\nwould be dead.\n\nHUGH TALBOT. Well? What an if I had been dead? You had your\norders. You did not dream of giving up the Bridge of Cashala--eh,\nMyles Butler?\n\nBUTLER (_after a moment_). No, sir.\n\nHUGH TALBOT. Nor you, Dick Fenton?\n\nFENTON. Sir, I--No!\n\nHUGH TALBOT (_smoking throughout_). Good lads! The wise heads were\nsaying I was a stark fool to set you here at Cashala. But I said:\nI can be trusting the young riders that are learning their\nlessons in war from me. I'll be safe putting my honor into their\nhands. And I was right, wasn't I, Phelimy Driscoll?\n\nDRISCOLL. Give us the chance, sir, and we'll be holding Cashala,\neven against the devil himself!\n\nFENTON. Aye, well said!\n\nHUGH TALBOT. Sure,'tis a passing good substitute for the devil\nsits yonder in Cromwell's tent.\n\nNEWCOMBE (_with a shudder_). Cromwell!\n\nHUGH TALBOT. Aye, he was slaying your brother at Drogheda, Kit,\nand a fine, gallant lad your brother was. And I'm thinking you're\nlike him, Kit. Else I shouldn't be trusting you here at Cashala.\n\nNEWCOMBE. I--I--Will they let us keep our swords?\n\nHUGH TALBOT. Well, it's with yourselves it lies, whether you'll\nkeep them or not.\n\nFENTON. He means--we mean--on what terms, sir, do we surrender?\n\nHUGH TALBOT. Surrender? Terms?\n\nJOHN TALBOT. We thought, sir, from your coming under their white\nflag--perhaps you had made terms for us.\n\nHUGH TALBOT. How could I make terms?\n\nNEWCOMBE. Captain!\n\n(_At a look from_ HUGH TALBOT _he becomes silent, fighting for\nself-control._)\n\nHUGH TALBOT. How could I make terms that you would hear to?\nCashala Bridge is the gate of Connaught.\n\nJOHN TALBOT. Yes.\n\nHUGH TALBOT. Give Cromwell Cashala Bridge, and he'll be on the\nheels of our women and our little ones. At what price would ye be\nselling their safety?\n\nDRISCOLL. Cromwell--when he takes us--when he takes us--\n\nNEWCOMBE. He'll knock us on the head!\n\nHUGH TALBOT. Yes. At the last. Your five lives against our\npeople's safety. You'd not give up the bridge?\n\nJOHN TALBOT. Five? Our five? But you--you are the sixth.\n\nFENTON. You stay with us, Captain. And then we'll fight--you'll\nsee how we shall fight.\n\nHUGH TALBOT. I shall be seeing you fight, perhaps, but I cannot\nstay now at Cashala.\n\n(_Rises._)\n\nDRISCOLL. Ye won't be staying with us?\n\nBUTLER (_laughing harshly_). Now, on my soul! Is this your faith,\nHugh Talbot? One liar I've followed, Charles Stuart, the son of a\nliar, and now a second liar--\n\nJOHN TALBOT (_catching BUTLER'S throat_). A plague choke you!\n\nHUGH TALBOT (_stepping between_ JOHN TALBOT _and_ BUTLER). Ha' done,\nJack! Ha' done! What more, Myles Butler?\n\nBUTLER. Tell us whither you go, when you turn your back on us\nthat shall die at Cashala--you that come walking under the rebel\nflag--that swore to bring us aid--and have not brought it! Tell\nus whither you go now!\n\nHUGH TALBOT. Well, I'm a shade doubtful, Myles, my lad, though\nhopeful of the best.\n\nBUTLER. 'Tis to Cromwell you go--you that have made your peace\nwith him--that have sold us--\n\nDRISCOLL. Captain! A' God's name, what is it that you're meaning?\n\nHUGH TALBOT. I mean that you shall hold the Bridge of\nCashala--whatever happen to you--whatever happen to me--\n\nFENTON. To you? Captain Talbot!\n\nHUGH TALBOT. I am going unto Cromwell--as you said, Myles. I gave\nmy promise.\n\nDRISCOLL. Your promise?\n\nJOHN TALBOT. We--have been very blind. So--they made you\nprisoner?\n\nHUGH TALBOT. Aye, Jack. When I tried to cut my way through to\nbring you aid. And they granted me this half hour on my parole to\ncome unto you.\n\nJOHN TALBOT. To come--\n\nHUGH TALBOT. To counsel you to surrender. And I have given you\ncounsel. Hold the bridge! Hold it! Whatever they do!\n\nDRISCOLL. Captain! Captain Talbot! God of Heaven! If you go\nback--'tis killed you'll be among them!\n\nHUGH TALBOT. A little sooner than you lads? Aye, true!\n\nFENTON.

(_In bad weather, these\npresumably may be closed by big double doors, which stand open\nnow--swung back outward beyond sight._) Thus the nearer opening is\nthe proscenium arch of the scene, under which the spectator looks\nthrough the shed to the background--a grassy yard, a road with\ngreat trunks of soaring elms, and the glimpse of a green\nhillside. The ceiling runs up into a gable with large beams.\n\nOn the right, at back, a door opens into the shed from the house\nkitchen. Opposite it, a door leads from the shed into the barn.\nIn the foreground, against the right wall, is a work-bench. On\nthis are tools, a long, narrow, wooden box, and a small\noil-stove, with steaming kettle upon it.\n\nAgainst the left wall, what remains of the year's wood supply is\nstacked, the uneven ridges sloping to a jumble of stovewood and\nkindlings mixed with small chips of the floor, which is piled\ndeep with mounds of crumbling bark, chips and wood-dust.\n\nNot far from this mounded pile, at right centre of the scene,\nstands a wooden armchair, in which LINK TADBOURNE, in his\nshirt-sleeves, sits drowsing. Silhouetted by the sunlight beyond,\nhis sharp-drawn profile is that of an old man, with white hair\ncropped close, and gray moustache of a faded black hue at the\nouter edges. Between his knees is a stout thong of wood, whittled\nround by the drawshave which his sleeping hand still holds in his\nlap. Against the side of his chair rests a thick wooden yoke and\ncollar. Near him is a chopping-block.\n\nIn the woodshed there is no sound or motion except the hum and\nfloating steam from the tea-kettle. Presently the old man murmurs\nin his sleep, clenching his hand. Slowly the hand relaxes again.\n\nFrom the door, right, comes POLLY--a sweet-faced girl of\nseventeen, quietly mature for her age. She is dressed simply. In\none hand she carries a man's wide-brimmed felt hat, over the\nother arm a blue coat. These she brings toward LINK. Seeing him\nasleep, she begins to tiptoe, lays the coat and hat on the\nchopping-block, goes to the bench, and trims the wick of the\noil-stove, under the kettle. Then she returns and stands near\nLINK, surveying the shed.\n\nOn closer scrutiny, the jumbled woodpile has evidently a certain\norder in its chaos; some of the splittings have been piled in\nirregular ridges; in places, the deep layer of wood-dust and\nchips has been scooped, and the little mounds slope and rise like\nminiature valleys and hills. [2]\n\nTaking up a hoe, POLLY--with careful steps--moves among the\nhollows, placing and arranging sticks of kindling, scraping and\nsmoothing the little mounds with the hoe. As she does so, from\nfar away, a bugle sounds.\n\n[Footnote 1: Copyright, 1912, by Percy Mackaye.

FRANK ALLEYNE, A curate\nSAM HORROCKS, A young man\n\nTHE SCENE _represents the interior of a cottage in a Lancashire\nvillage. Through the window at the back the gray row of cottages\nopposite is just visible. The outside door is next to the window.\nDoor left. As regards furniture the room is very bare. The\nsuggestion is not of an empty room, but a stripped room. For\nexample, there are several square patches where the distemper of\nthe walls is of a darker shade than the rest, indicating the\nplaces once occupied by pictures. There is an uncovered deal\nthe left wall is a dresser and a plate-rack above it containing a\nfew pots. The dresser has also one or two utensils upon it. A\nblackened kettle rests on the top of the cooking-range, but the\nroom contains only the barest necessities. The floor is\nuncarpeted. There are no window curtains, but a yard of cheap\nmuslin is fastened across the window, not coming, however, high\nenough to prevent a passer-by from looking in, should he wish to\ndo so. On the floor, near the fire, is a battered black tin\ntrunk, the lid of which is raised. On a peg behind the door left\nis a black silk skirt and bodice and an old-fashioned beaded\nbonnet. The time is afternoon. As the curtain rises the room is\nempty. Immediately, however, the door left opens and SARAH\nORMEROD, an old woman, enters, carrying clumsily in her arms a\ncouple of pink flannelette nightdresses, folded neatly. Her black\nstuff dress is well worn, and her wedding-ring is her only\nornament. She wears elastic-sided boots, and her rather short\nskirt shows a pair of gray worsted stockings. A small plaid shawl\ncovers her shoulders. SARAH crosses and puts the nightdresses on\nthe table, surveying the trunk ruefully. There is a knock at the\noutside door and she looks up._\n\n\nSARAH. Who's theer?\n\nEMMA (_without_). It's me, Mrs. Ormerod, Emma Brierley.\n\nSARAH. Eh, coom in, Emma, lass.\n\n(_Enter_ EMMA BRIERLEY. _She is a young weaver, and, having just\nleft her work, she wears a dark skirt, a blouse of some\nindeterminate blue-gray shade made of cotton, and a large shawl\nover her head and shoulders in place of a jacket and hat. A\ncolored cotton apron covers her skirt below the waist, and the\nshort skirt displays stout stockings similar to Sarah's. She\nwears clogs, and the clothes--except the shawl--are covered with\nends of cotton and cotton-wool fluff. Even her hair has not\nescaped. A pair of scissors hangs by a cord from her waist._)\n\nSARAH. Tha's kindly welcoom. It's good o' thee to think o'\ncoomin' to see an ould woman like me.\n\nEMMA (_by door_). Nought o' th' sort, Mrs. Ormerod. Th' mill's just\nloosed and A thowt A'd step in as A were passin' and see 'ow tha\nwas feeling like.\n\nSARAH (_crossing to box_). Oh, nicely, nicely, thankee. It's\nonly my 'ands as is gone paralytic, tha knaws, an' a weaver's no\nmanner o' good to nobody without th' use o' 'er'ands. A'm all\nreeght in masel'. That's worst of it.\n\nEMMA. Well, while A'm 'ere, Mrs. Ormerod, is theer nought as A\ncan do for thee?\n\nSARAH. A dunno as theer is, thankee, Emma.\n\nEMMA (_taking her shawl off, looking round and hanging it on a\npeg in the door_). Well, A knaws better. What wert doin' when\nA coom in? Packin' yon box?\n\nSARAH. Aye. Tha sees theer's a two three things as A canna bear\nthowt o' parting from. A don't reeghtly knaw if they'll let me\ntak' 'em into workus wi' me, but A canna have 'em sold wi' rest\nof stuff.\n\nEMMA (_crosses below SARAH to box, going on her knees_). Let me\nhelp yo'.\n\nSARAH. Tha's a good lass, Emma. A'd tak' it kindly of thee.\n\nEMMA. They'd do wi' packin' a bit closer. A dunno as they'd carry\nsafe that road.\n\nSARAH. A know. It's my 'ands, tha sees, as mak's it difficult for\nme.\n\n(_Sits on chair._)\n\nEMMA. Aye. A'll soon settle 'em a bit tighter.\n\n(_Lifts all out, buries her arms in the box, and rearranges its\ncontents._)\n\nSARAH. But what's 'appened to thy looms, lass? They'll not weave\nby 'emselves while thee's 'ere, tha knows.\n\nEMMA (_looking round_). Eh, looms is all reeght. Factory's stopped.\nIt's Saturday afternoon.\n\nSARAH. So 't is. A'd clean forgot. A do forget time o' th' week\nsittin' 'ere day arter day wi' nought to do.\n\nEMMA. So that's all reeght. Tha's no need to worry about me.\nTha's got trouble enough of thy own.\n\n(_Resuming at the box_)\n\nSARAH. Aye, th' art reeght theer, lass. Theer's none on us likes\nto think o' goin' to workus when we're ould.\n\nEMMA. 'Appen it'll be all reeght after all. Parson's coomin' to\nsee thee.\n\nSARAH. Aye, A knaw 'e is. A dunno, but A'm in 'opes 'e'll do\nsummat for me. Tha can't never tell what them folks can do.\n\nEMMA (_kneeling up_). Tha keep thy pecker oop, Mrs. Ormerod. That's\nwhat my moother says to me when A tould 'er A were coomin' in to\nthee. Keep 'er pecker oop, she says. It's not as if she'd been\nlazy or a wastrel, she says; Sal Ormerod's bin a 'ard worker in\n'er day, she says. It's not as if it were thy fault. Tha can't\n'elp tha 'ands goin' paralytic.\n\n(_She continues rummaging in the trunk while speaking._)\n\nSARAH. Naw. It's not my fault. God knaws A'm game enough for\nwork, ould as A am. A allays knawed as A'd 'ave to work for my\nliving all th' days o' my life. A never was a savin' sort.\n\nEMMA. Theer's nowt against thee for that. Theer's soom as can be\ncareful o' theer brass an' soom as can't. It's not a virtue, it's\na gift. That's what my moother allays says.\n\n(_Resumes packing._)\n\nSARAH. She's reeght an' all. We never 'ad the gift o' savin', my\nman and me. An' when Tom Ormerod took an' died, the club money as\nA drew all went on 'is funeral an' 'is gravestone. A warn't goin'\nto 'ave it said as 'e warn't buried proper.\n\nEMMA. It were a beautiful funeral, Mrs. Ormerod.\n\nSARAH. Aye.\n\nEMMA. A will say that, beautiful it were. A never seen a better,\nan' A goes to all as A can. (_Rises._) A dotes on buryin's. Are\nthese the next?\n\n(_Crosses before table for nightdresses, takes the nightdresses\nand resumes packing._)\n\nSARAH. Aye\n\n(_Emma puts them in and rests on her knees listening to Sarah's\nnext speech._)\n\nSARAH (_pause_). A've been a 'ouseproud woman all my life, Emma,\nan' A've took pride in 'avin' my bits o' sticks as good as\nanother's. Even th' manager's missus oop to factory 'ouse theer,\nshe never 'ad a better show o' furniture nor me, though A says it\nas shouldn't. An' it tak's brass to keep a decent 'ouse over your\nyead. An' we allays 'ad our full week's 'ollydayin' at Blackpool\nreg'lar at Wakes time. Us didn't 'ave no childer o' our own to\nspend it on, an' us spent it on ourselves. A allays 'ad a plenty\no' good food in th' 'ouse an' never stinted nobody, an' Tom 'e\nliked 'is beer an' 'is baccy. 'E were a pigeon-fancier, too, in\n'is day, were my Tom, an' pigeon-fancying runs away wi' a mint o'\nmoney. No. Soom'ow theer never was no brass to put in th' bank.\nWe was allays spent oop coom wages neeght.\n\nEMMA. A knaw, Mrs. Ormerod. May be A'm young, but A knaw 'ow 't\nis. We works cruel 'ard in th' mill, an' when us plays, us plays\nas 'ard too (_pause_), an' small blame to us either. It's our\n_own_ we're spendin'.\n\nSARAH. Aye. It's a 'ard life, the factory 'and's. A can mind me\nmany an' many's the time when th' warnin' bell went on th'\nfactory lodge at ha'f past five of a winter's mornin' as A've\ncraved for another ha'f hour in my bed, but Tom 'e got me oop an'\nwe was never after six passin' through factory gates all th'\nyears we were wed. There's not many as can say they were never\nlate. \"Work or clem,\" that were what Tom allays tould me th' ould\nbell were sayin'. An' 'e were reeght, Emma. \"Work or clem\" is\nGod's truth. (EMMA'S _head in box._) An' now th' time's coom when A\ncan't work no more. But Parson's a good man, 'e'll mak' it all\nreeght. (EMMA'S _head appears._) Eh, it were good o' thee to coom\nin, lass. A bit o' coompany do mak' a world o' difference. A'm\ntwice as cheerful as A were.\n\nEMMA. A'm glad to 'ear tha say so, Mrs. Ormerod. (_Rises from the\nbox._) Is theer owt else?\n\nSARAH. A were thinkin' A'd like to tak' my black silk as A've\nworn o' Sundays this many a year, but A canna think it's reeght\nthing for workus.\n\nEMMA. Oh, thee tak' it, Mrs. Ormerod.\n\nSARAH. A'd dearly love to. Tha sees A'm noan in debt, nobbut what\nchairs an table 'ull payfor, and A doan't like thowt o' leaving\nowt as A'm greatly fond of.\n\nEMMA. Yo doan't, Mrs. Ormerod. Thee tak' it. Wheer is it? A'll\nput un in. Theer's lots o'room on top. A'll see un's noan\ncrushed.\n\nSARAH. It's hanging theer behind door. (EMMA _crosses back to\ndoor, gets clothes._) A got un out to show Parson. A thowt A'd ask\nun if it were proper to tak' it if A've to go. My best bonnet's\nwith it, an' all.\n\n(EMMA _goes below table, takes the frock and bonnet, folds it on\nthe table, and packs it._)\n\nEMMA. A'll put un in.\n\nSARAH. A'm being a lot o' trouble to thee, lass.\n\nEMMA. That's nowt; neighbors mun be neighborly.\n\n(_Gets bonnet from table and packs it._)\n\nSARAH (_after a pause, looking round_). Place doan't look much, an'\nthat's a fact. Th' furniture's bin goin' bit by bit, and theer\nain't much left to part wi' now.\n\nEMMA. Never mind; it 'ull be all reeght now Parson's takken thee\noop.\n\nSARAH. A'm hopin' so. A _am_ hopin' so. A never could abide\nth' thowt o' th' workus--me as 'as bin an 'ard-workin' woman. A\ncouldn't fancy sleepin' in a strange bed wi' strange folk round\nme, an' when th' Matron said, \"Do that,\" A'd 'ave to do it, an'\nwhen she said, \"Go theer,\" A'd 'ave to a' gone wheer she tould\nme--me as 'as allays 'eld my yead 'igh an' gone the way A pleased\nmasel'. Eh, it's a terrible thowt, the workus.\n\nEMMA (_rising_). Now tha's sure that's all?\n\nSARAH (_after a pause, considers_). Eh, if A havna forgot my\nneeghtcaps. (_Rises, moves centre and stops._) A suppose they'll\nlet me wear un in yonder. A doan't reeghtly think as A'd get my\nrest proper wi'out my neeghtcaps.\n\nEMMA. Oh, they'll let thee wear un all reeght.\n\nSARAH (_as she goes_). A'll go an' get un. (_Exit right, returning\npresently with the white nightcaps._) That's all now.\n\n(_Gives them to_ EMMA _who meets her at centre._)\n\nEMMA (_putting them in_). Yo' never 'ad no childer, did yo', Mrs.\nOrmerod?\n\nSARAH. No, Emma, no--maybe that's as broad as's long. (_Sits above\nfire._) Yo' never knaw 'ow they go. Soom on 'em turn again yo'\nwhen they're growed, or they get wed themselves an' forget all as\nyo' 've done for 'em, like a many A could name, and they're\nallays a worrit to yo' when they're young.\n\nEMMA. A'm gettin' wed masel' soon, Mrs. Ormerod.\n\nSARAH. Are yo', now, Emma? Well, tha art not one o' them\ngraceless good-for-nowts. Tha'll never forget thy moother, A\nknaw, nor what she's done for thee. Who's tha keepin' coompany\nwith?\n\nEMMA. It's Joe Hindle as goes wi' me, Mrs. Ormerod.\n\nSARAH. 'Indle, 'Indle? What, not son to Robert 'Indle, 'im as\nused to be overlooker in th' factory till 'e went to foreign\nparts to learn them Roossians 'ow to weave?\n\nEMMA. Aye, that's 'im.\n\nSARAH. Well, A dunno aught about th' lad. 'Is faither were a fine\nman. A minds 'im well. But A'll tell thee this, Emma, an' A'll\ntell it thee to thy faice, 'e's doin' well for 'isself, is young\nJoe 'Indle.\n\nEMMA. Thankee, Mrs. Ormerod.\n\nSARAH. Gettin' wed! Think o' that. Why, it seems as 't were only\nt'other day as tha was runnin' about in short frocks, an' now\ntha's growed up and gettin' thasel' wed! Time do run on. Sithee,\nEmma, tha's a good lass, A've gotten an ould teapot in yonder\n(_indicating her bedroom_) as my moother give me when A was wed. A\nweren't for packing it in box because o' risk o' breaking it. A\nwere going to carry it in my 'and. A'd a mind to keep it till A\ndied, but A reckon A'll 'ave no use for it in workus.\n\nEMMA. Tha's not gone theer yet.\n\nSARAH. Never mind that. (_Slowly rises._) A'm going to give it\nthee, lass, for a weddin' gift. Tha'll tak' care of it, A knaw,\nand when thy eye catches it, 'appen tha'll spare me a thowt.\n\nEMMA. Oh, no, Mrs. Ormerod, A couldn't think o' takkin' it.\n\nSARAH. Art too proud to tak' a gift from me?\n\nEMMA. No. Tha knaws A'm not.\n\nSARAH. Then hold thy hush. A'll be back in a minute. Happen A'd\nbest tidy masel' up too against Parson cooms.\n\nEMMA. Can A help thee, Mrs. Ormerod?\n\nSARAH. No, lass, no. A can do a bit for masel'. My 'ands isn't\nthat bad; A canna weave wi' 'em, but A can do all as A need do.\n\nEMMA. Well, A'll do box up.\n\n(_Crosses to table right and gets cord._)\n\nSARAH. Aye.\n\nEMMA. All reeght.\n\n(_Exit_ SARAH. _A man's face appears outside at the window. He\nsurveys the room, and then the face vanishes as he knocks at the\ndoor._)\n\nWho's theer?\n\nSAM (_without_). It's me, Sam Horrocks. (_EMMA crosses left and\nopens door._) May A coom in?\n\nEMMA. What dost want?\n\nSAM (_on the doorstep_). A want a word wi' thee, Emma Brierley. A\nfollowed thee oop from factory and A've bin waitin' out theer\ntill A'm tired o' waitin'.\n\nEMMA. Well, tha'd better coom in. A 'aven't time to talk wi' thee\nat door.\n\n(EMMA _lets him in, closes door, and, leaving him standing in the\nmiddle of the room, resumes work on her knees at the box._ SAM\nHORROCKS _is a hulking young man of a rather vacant expression. He\nis dressed in mechanic's blue dungarees. His face is oily and his\nclothes stained. He wears boots, not clogs. He mechanically takes\na ball of oily black cotton-waste from his right pocket when in\nconversational difficulties and wipes his hands upon it. He has a\nred muffler round his neck without collar, and his shock affair\nhair is surmounted by a greasy black cap, which covers perhaps\none tenth of it._)\n\nSAM (_after watching_ EMMA's _back for a moment_). Wheer's Mrs.\nOrmerod?\n\nEMMA (_without looking up_). What's that to do wi' thee?\n\nSAM (_apologetically_). A were only askin'. Tha needn't be short\nwi' a chap.\n\nEMMA. She's in scullery washin' 'er, if tha wants to knaw.\n\nSAM. Oh!\n\nEMMA (_looking at him over her shoulder after a slight pause_).\nDoan't tha tak' thy cap off in 'ouse, Sam Horrocks?\n\nSAM. Naw.\n\nEMMA. Well, tha can tak' it off in this 'ouse or get t' t'other\nside o' door.\n\nSAM. (_Takes off his cap and stuffs it in his left pocket after\ntrying his right and finding the ball of waste in it._) Yes, Emma.\n\n(EMMA _resumes work with her back towards him and waits for him to\nspeak. But he is not ready yet._)\n\nEMMA. Well, what dost want?\n\nSAM. Nought.--Eh, but tha art a gradely wench.\n\nEMMA. What's that to do wi' thee?\n\nSAM. Nought.\n\nEMMA. Then just tha mind thy own business, an' doan't pass\ncompliments behind folks' backs.\n\nSAM. A didn't mean no 'arm.\n\nEMMA. Well?\n\nSAM. It's a fine day, isn't it? For th' time o' th' year?\n\nEMMA. Aye.\n\nSAM. A very fine day.\n\nEMMA. Aye.\n\nSAM (_desperately_). It's a damned fine day.\n\nEMMA. Aye.\n\nSAM (_after a moment_). Dost know my 'ouse, Emma?\n\nEMMA. Aye.\n\nSAM. Wert ever in it?\n\nEMMA. Not sin' tha moother died.\n\nSAM. Naw. A suppose not. Not sin' ma moother died. She were a\nfine woman, ma moother, for all she were bed-ridden.\n\nEMMA. She were better than 'er son, though that's not saying much\nneither.\n\nSAM. Naw, but tha does mind ma 'ouse, Emma, as it were when she\nwere alive?\n\nEMMA. Aye.\n\nSAM. A 've done a bit at it sin' them days. Got a new quilt on\nbed from Co-op. Red un, it is, wi' blue stripes down 'er.\n\nEMMA. Aye.\n\nSAM. Well, Emma?\n\nEMMA (_over her shoulder_). Well, what? What's thy 'ouse an' thy\nquilt to do wi' me?\n\nSAM. Oh, nought.--Tha doesn't 'elp a feller much, neither.\n\nEMMA. (_Rises and faces him. SAM is behind corner table and backs\na little before her._) What's tha gettin' at, Sam Horrocks? Tha's\ngot a tongue in thy faice, hasn't tha?\n\nSAM. A suppose so. A doan't use it much though.\n\nEMMA. No. Tha's not much better than a tongue-tied idiot, Sam\nHorrocks, allays mooning about in th' engine-house in daytime an'\nsulkin' at 'ome neeghttime.\n\nSAM. Aye, A'm lonely sin' ma moother died. She did 'ave a way wi'\n'er, ma moother. Th' 'ould plaice 'as not bin t' same to me sin'\nshe went. Daytime, tha knaws, A'm all reeght. Tha sees, them\nengines, them an' me's pals. They talks to me an' A understands\ntheir ways. A doan't some'ow seem to understand th' ways o' folks\nlike as A does th' ways o' them engines.\n\nEMMA. Tha doesn't try. T' other lads goes rattin' or\ndog-feeghtin' on a Sunday or to a football match of a Saturday\nafternoon. Tha stays moonin' about th' 'ouse. Tha's not likely to\nunderstand folks. Tha's not sociable.\n\nSAM. Naw. That's reeght enough. A nobbut get laughed at when A\ntries to be sociable an' stand my corner down at th' pub wi' th'\nrest o' th' lads. It's no use ma tryin' to soop ale; A can't\ncarry th' drink like t' others. A knaws A've ways o' ma own.\n\nEMMA. Tha has that.\n\nSAM. A'm terrible lonesome, Emma. That theer 'ouse o' mine, it do\nwant a wench about th' plaice. Th' engines is all reeght for\ndays, but th' neeghts is that lonesome-like tha wouldn't believe.\n\nEMMA. Tha's only thasel' to blame. It's nought to do wi' me,\nchoosehow.\n\nSAM. Naw? A'd--A'd 'oped as 'ow it might 'ave, Emma.\n\nEMMA (_approaching threateningly_). Sam Horrocks, if tha doan't\ntell me proper what tha means A 'll give tha such a slap in th'\nmouth.\n\nSAM (_backing before her_). Tha does fluster a feller, Emma. Just\nlike ma moother.\n\nEMMA. A wish A 'ad bin. A'd 'ave knocked some sense into thy\nsilly yead.\n\nSAM (_suddenly and clumsily kneels above chair left of table_).\nWilt tha 'ave me, Emma? A mak' good money in th'engine-house.\n\nEMMA. Get oop, tha great fool. If tha didn't keep thasel' so\nclose wi' tha moonin' about in th' engine-'ouse an' never\nspeakin' a word to nobody, tha'd knaw A were keepin' coompany wi'\nJoe Hindle.\n\nSAM (_scrambling up_). Is that a fact, Emma?\n\nEMMA. Of course it's a fact. Banns 'ull be oop come Sunday\nfortneeght. We've not 'idden it neither. It's just like the great\nblind idiot that tha art not to 'a' seen it long enough sin'.\n\nSAM. A wer'n't aware. By gum, A 'ad so 'oped as tha'd 'ave me,\nEmma.\n\nEMMA (_a little more softly_). A'm sorry if A've 'urt thee, Sam.\n\nSAM. Aye. It were ma fault. Eh, well, A think mebbe A'd best be\ngoin'.\n\nEMMA (_lifts box to left_). Aye. Parson's coomin' to see Mrs.\nOrmerod in a minute.\n\nSAM (_with pride_). A knaw all about that, anyhow.\n\nEMMA. She'm in a bad way. A dunno masel' as Parson can do much\nfor 'er.\n\nSAM. It's 'ard lines on an ould un. Well, yo' 'll not want\nme'ere. A 'll be movin' on. (_Getting his cap out_) No offense,\nEmma, A 'ope. A'd 'ave asked thee first if A'd knawn as 'e were\nafter thee. A've bin tryin' for long enough.\n\nEMMA. No. Theer's no offense, Sam. Tha's a good lad if tha art a\nfool, an' mebbe tha's not to blame for that. Good-bye.\n\nSAM. Good-bye, Emma. An'--An' A 'ope 'e'll mak' thee 'appy. A'd\ndearly like to coom to th' weddin' an' shake 'is 'and.\n\n(MRS. ORMEROD _heard off right._)\n\nEMMA. A'll see tha's asked. Theer's Mrs. Ormerod stirrin'. Tha'd\nbest be gettin'.\n\nSAM. All reeght. Good-bye, Emma.\n\nEMMA. Good-bye, Sam.\n\n(_Exit_ SAM _left centre._ MRS. ORMEROD _comes from the inside door.\nShe has a small blue teapot in her hand._)\n\nSARAH. Was anybody 'ere, Emma? A thowt A yeard someun talkin',\nonly my yearin' isn't what it used to be, an' A warn't sure.\n\nEMMA. It were Sam Horrocks, Mrs. Ormerod.\n\nSARAH. Yon lad of ould Sal Horrocks as died last year? 'Im as\nisn't reeght in 'is yead?\n\nEMMA. Aye. 'E's bin askin' me to wed 'im.\n\nSARAH (_incensed_). In my 'ouse? Theer's imperence for thee, an'\ntha promised to another lad, an' all. A'd 'ave set about 'im wi'\na stick, Emma.\n\nEMMA. 'E didn't knaw about Joe. It made me feel cruel like to\n'ave to tell 'im.\n\nSARAH. 'E'll get ower it. Soom lass 'll tak' 'im.\n\nEMMA. A suppose so.\n\nSARAH (_coming down, putting the teapot in EMMA'S hands_). Well,\ntheer's teapot.\n\nEMMA (_meets SARAH right centre, examining teapot_). It's\nbeautiful. Beautiful, it is, Mrs. Ormerod.\n\nSARAH. Aye, it's a bit o' real china is that. Tha'll tak' care\non't, lass, won't thee?\n\nEMMA. A will an' all.\n\nSARAH. Aye. A knaw it's safe wi' thee. Mebbe safer than it would\nbe in workus. A can't think well on yon plaice. A goa cold all\nower at thowt of it.\n\n(_A knock at the door._)\n\nEMMA. That'll be Parson.\n\nSARAH (_crosses left, smoothing her hair_). Goa an' look through\nwindow first, an' see who 't is.\n\nEMMA (_puts teapot on table; looking through window_). It is not\nth' ould Parson. It's one o' them young curate chaps.\n\nSARAH. Well, coom away from window an' sit thee down. It won't do\nto seem too eager. Let un knock again if it's not th' ould\nParson.\n\n(EMMA _leaves the window and goes to right of table. The knock is\nrepeated._)\n\nSARAH (_raising her voice_). Coom in so who tha art. Door's on\nlatch.\n\n(_Enter the_ REV. FRANK ALLEYNE. _He is a young curate, a\nLondoner and an Oxford man, by association, training, and taste\ntotally unfitted for a Lancashire curacy, in which he is,\nunfortunately, no exception._)\n\nALLEYNE. Good afternoon, Mrs. Ormerod.\n\nSARAH. Good day to thee.\n\nALLEYNE. I'm sorry to say Mr. Blundell has had to go to a\nmissionary meeting, but he asked me to come and see you in his\nstead.\n\nSARAH. Tha's welcoom, lad. Sit thee doon.\n\n(EMMA _comes below table left. Dusts a chair, which doesn't need\nit, with her apron._ ALLEYNE _raises a deprecatory hand._ SARAH'S\n_familiarity, as it seems to him, offends him. He looks sourly at_\nEMMA _and markedly ignores her._)\n\nALLEYNE. Thank you; no, I won't sit; I cannot stay long.\n\nSARAH. Just as tha likes. It's all same to me.\n\n(EMMA _stays by right of table._)\n\nALLEYNE. How is it with you, Mrs. Ormerod?\n\nSARAH. It might be worse. A've lost th' use o' my 'ands, and\nthey're takin' me to workus, but A'm not dead yet, and that's\nsummat to be thankul for.\n\nALLEYNE. Oh, yes, yes, Mrs. Ormerod. The--er--message I am to\ndeliver is, I fear, not quite what Mr. Blundell led you to hope\nfor. His efforts on your behalf have--er--- unfortunately failed.\nHe finds himself obliged to give up all hope of aiding you to a\nlivelihood. In fact--er--I understand that the arrangements made\nfor your removal to the workhouse this afternoon must be carried\nout. It seems there is no alternative. I am grieved to be the\nbearer of bad tidings, but I am sure you will find a comfortable\nhome awaiting you, Mrs.--er--Ormerod.\n\nSARAH. 'Appen A shall an' 'appen A shan't. Theer's no tellin' 'ow\nyou'll favor a thing till you've tried it.\n\nALLEYNE. You must resign yourself to the will of Providence. The\nconsolations of religion are always with us. Shall I pray with\nyou?\n\nSARAH. A never were much at prayin' when A were well off, an' A\ndoubt the Lord ud tak' it kind o' selfish o' me if A coom cryin'\nto 'im now A'm 'urt.\n\nALLEYNE. He will understand. Can I do nothing for you?\n\nSARAH. A dunno as tha can, thankin' thee all same.\n\nALLEYNE. I am privileged with Mr. Blundell's permission to bring\na little gift to you, Mrs. Ormerod. (_Feeling in his coattails\nand bringing out a Testament._) Allow me to present you with this\nTestament, and may it help you to bear your Cross with resignation.\n(_He hands her the Testament._ SARAH _does not raise her hands,\nand it drops on her lap._ ALLEYNE _takes it again and puts it on\nthe table._) Ah, yes, of course--your poor hands--I understand.\n\nSARAH. Thankee kindly. Readin' don't coom easy to me, an' my eyes\naren't what they were, but A'll mak' most of it.\n\nALLEYNE. You will never read that in vain. And now, dear sister,\nI must go. I will pray for strength for you. All will be well.\nGood day.\n\nSARAH. Good day to thee.\n\n(_Exit_ ALLEYNE.)\n\nEMMA. Tha doesn't look so pleased wi' tha gift, Mrs. Ormerod.\n\nSARAH. It's not square thing of th' ould Parson, Emma. 'E should\n'a' coom an' tould me 'isself. Looks like 'e were feart to do it.\nA never could abide them curate lads. We doan't want no grand\nLunnon gentlemen down 'ere. 'E doan't understand us no more than\nwe understand 'im. 'E means all reeght, poor lad. Sithee, Emma,\nA've bin a church-goin' woman all my days. A was browt oop to\nchurch, an' many's th' bit o' brass they've 'ad out o' me in my\ntime. An' in th' end they send me a fine curate with a tuppenny\nTestament. That's all th' good yo' get out o' they folks.\n\nEMMA. We'm chapel to our 'ouse, an' 'e didn't forget to let me\nsee 'e knaw'd it, but A doan't say as it's ony different wi'\nchapels, neither. They get what they can outer yo', but yo'\nmustn't look for nothin' back, when th' pinch cooms. (_Clock\noutside strikes three._) Sakes alive, theer's clock goin' three.\nMy dinner 'ull be nice an' cold.\n\nSARAH. Eh, what's that, lass? Dost mean to tell me tha's bin\nclemmin' all this time?\n\nEMMA. A coom 'ere straight from factory.\n\nSARAH. Then tha doesn't move till tha's 'ad summat to eat.\n\nEMMA. My dinner's ready for me at whoam, Mrs. Ormerod.\n\nSARAH. Then just look sharp an' get it, tha silly lass. Tha 's no\nreeght to go wi'out thy baggin'.\n\nEMMA (_putting her shawl on_). All reeght. A'm off.\n\n(_Picks up teapot._)\n\nSARAH. Tha's bin a world o' coomfort to me, Emma. It'll be 'arder\nto bear when tha's gone. Th' thowt's too much for me. Eh, lass,\nA'm feart o' yon great gaunt building wi' th' drear windows.\n\nEMMA. 'Appen ma moother 'ull coom in. Tha'll do wi' a bit o'\ncoompany. A 'll ask her to coom an' fetch thee a coop o' tea\nbye-an'-bye.\n\n(_A knock at the door._)\n\nSARAH. Who's theer?\n\nSAM (_without_). It's only me, Mrs. Ormerod.\n\nEMMA. A do declare it's that Sam Horrocks again.\n\nSARAH. Sam Horrocks! What can th'lad be after now? (_Calling_) Hast\ntha wiped thy boots on scraper?\n\nSAM. Yes, Mrs. Ormerod.\n\nSARAH. Coom in then. (EMMA _in left corner. Enter_ SAM.) Tak' thy\ncap off.\n\nSAM. Yes, Mrs. Ormerod.\n\nSARAH. What dost want?\n\nSAM. A've soom business 'ere. A thowt A'd find thee by thysel'.\nA'll coom again (_bolting nervously for the door_).\n\nSARAH. Let that door be. Dost say tha's got business 'ere?\n\nSAM. Aye, wi' thee. A'd like a word wi' thee private.\n\n(EMMA _moves to open door._)\n\nSARAH. All reeght. Emma's just goin' to 'er dinner.\n\nEMMA (_speaking through door_). A'll ask my moother to step hi\nlater on, Mrs. Ormerod, and thank thee very much for th' teapot.\n\nSARAH. A'll be thankful if she'll coom. (_Exit_ EMMA _with teapot._)\nNow, Sam Horrocks, what's the matter wi' thee?\n\nSAM (_dropping the cotton-waste he is fumbling with and picking it\nup_). It's a fine day for th' time o' th' year.\n\nSARAH. Didst want to see me private to tell me that, lad?\n\nSAM. Naw, not exactly.\n\nSARAH. Well, what is it then? Coom, lad, A'm waitin' on thee. Art\ntongue-tied? Can't tha quit mawlin' yon bit o' waste an' tell me\nwhat 'tis tha wants?\n\nSAM (_desperately_). Mebbe it'll not be so fine in th' mornin'.\n\nSARAH. A'll tell thee what A'd do to thee if A 'ad the use o' my\n'ands, my lad. A'd coom aside thee and A'd box thy ears. If tha's\ngot business wi' me, tha'd best state it sharp or A 'll be\nshowin' thee the shape o' my door.\n\nSAM. Tha do fluster a feller so as A doan't knaw wheer A am. A've\nnot been nagged like that theer sin' my ould moother died.\n\nSARAH. A've 'eerd folk say Sal Horrocks were a slick un wi' 'er\ntongue.\n\nSAM (_admiringly_). She were that. Rare talker she were. She'd lie\ntheer in 'er bed all day as it might be in yon corner, an' call\nme all th' names she could put her tongue to, till A couldn't\ntell ma reeght 'and from ma left. (_Still reminiscent._) Wonnerful\nsperrit, she 'ad, considerin' she were bed-ridden so long. She\nwere only a little un an' cripple an' all, but by gum, she could\nsling it at a feller if 'er tea weren't brewed to 'er taste.\nTalk! She'd talk a donkey's yead off, she would.\n\nSARAH (_on her mettle_). An' A'll talk thy silly yead off an' all\nif tha doan't get sharp to tellin' me what tha wants after in my\n'ouse, tha great mazed idiot.\n\nSAM. Eh, but she were a rare un.\n\nSARAH. The lad's daft aboot his moother.\n\nSAM (_detachedly, looking at window; pause_). Wunnerful breeght the\nsky is, to-day.\n\nSARAH. Tha great 'ulkin' fool. A'd tak' a broomstick to thee\nif--if A'd the use o' my 'ands.\n\nSAM. Now, if that isn't just what ma moother used to say.\n\nSARAH. Dang thy moother. An' A doan't mean no disrepect to 'er\nneither. She's bin in 'er grave this year an' more, poor woman.\n\nSAM. A canna 'elp thinkin' to 'er all same. Eh, but she were\nwunnerful.\n\nSARAH. An' A'd be wunnerful too. A'd talk to thee. A'd call thee\nif A were thy moother an' A'd to live aside o' thee neeght an'\nday.\n\nSAM (_eagerly_). Eh, by gum, but A wish tha would.\n\nSARAH. Would what?\n\nSAM. Would coom an' live along wi' me.\n\nSARAH. Tha great fool, what does mean? Art askin' me to wed thee?\n\nSAM. A didn't mean to offend thee, Mrs. Ormerod. A'm sorry A\nspoke. A allays do wrong thing. But A did so 'ope as tha might\ncoom. Tha sees A got used to moother. A got used to 'earin' 'er\ncuss me. A got used to doin' for 'er an' A've nought to do in th'\nevenings now. It's terrible lonesome in th' neeghttime. An' when\nnotion coom to me, A thowt as A'd mention un to thee casual.\n\nSARAH. Dost mean it, Sam Horrocks? Dost tha know what tha's\nsayin', or is tha foolin' me?\n\nSAM. O' course A mean it. Tha sees A'm not a marryin' sort. Th'\nlasses won't look at me. A'm silly Sam to them, A knaws it. A've\na slate loose; A shan't never get wed. A thowt A'd mebbe a chance\nwi' yon lass as were 'ere wi' thee, but hoo towld me A were too\nlate. A allays were slow. A left askin' too long an' A 've missed\n'er. A gets good money, Mrs. Ormerod, but A canna talk to a young\nwench. They mak's me go 'ot and cowld all over. An' when curate\ntowld me as tha was to go to workus, A thowt A'd a chance wi'\nthee. A knaw'd it weren't a big chance, because my plaice ain't\nmuch cop after what tha's bin used to 'ere. A've got no fine\nfixin's nor big chairs an' things like as tha used to 'ave. Eh,\nbut A would 'ave loved to do for thee as A used to do for ma\nmoother, an' when A yeerd thee talkin' now an' callin' me a fool\nan' th' rest, by gum, A just yearned to 'ave thee for allays.\nTha'd fill 'er plaice wunnerful well. A'd just a' loved to adopt\nthee.\n\nSARAH. To adopt me?\n\nSAM. Ay, for a moother. A'm sorry tha can't see thy way to let\nme. A didn't mean no offence (_turning to the door_).\n\nSARAH. 'Ere, lad, tha tell me this. If A'd said tha might tak' me\nfor thy moother, what wouldst ha' done?\n\nSAM. Why, kissed thee, an' takken thee oop in ma arms whoam to\nthy bed. It's standin' ready in yonder wi' clean sheets an' all,\nan' a new quilt from Co-op. A 'opes you'll pardon th' liberty o'\nmentioning it.\n\nSARAH. A new quilt, Sam? What's color?\n\nSAM. Red, wi' blue stripes down 'er.\n\nSARAH. A'm not a light weight, tha knows.\n\nSAM. A'd carry thee easy--\"Strong in th' arm and weak in th'\nyead.\" It's an ould sayin', but it's a good un, an' it fits.\n\nSARAH. Wilt tha try, Sam Horrocks? God bless thee, wilt tha try,\nlad?\n\nSAM. Dost mean it, Mrs. Ormerod? Dost mean tha'll coom? Tha's not\ncoddin' a feller, art tha?\n\nSARAH. No, A'm not coddin'. Kiss me, Sam, my son.\n\n(_He kisses her and lifts her in his arms._)\n\nSAM. By gum, but that were good. A'll coom back fur thy box.\n\nSABAH. Carry me careful, tha great luny. A'm not a sack o' flour.\n\nSAM. Eh, but A likes to year thee talk. Yon was real mootherly,\nit were.\n\n(_Exit through door, carrying her._)\n\n[CURTAIN _at clink of latch_]\n\n\n\n\nRIDERS TO THE SEA[1]\n\nJ.M. Synge\n\n[Footnote 1: Included by permission of Messrs. John W. Luce and\nCompany.]\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nMAURYA, an old woman\nBARTLEY, her son\nCATHLEEN, her daughter\nNORA, a younger daughter\nMEN AND WOMEN\n\nSCENE: _An island off the West of Ireland. Cottage kitchen, with\nnets, oilskins, spinning-wheel, some new boards standing by the\nwall, etc._ CATHLEEN, _a girl of about twenty, finishes kneading\ncake, and puts it down in the pot-oven by the fire; then wipes\nher hands, and begins to spin at the wheel._ NORA, _a young girl,\nputs her head in at the door._\n\n\nNORA (_in a low voice_). Where is she?\n\nCATHLEEN. She's lying down, God help her, and maybe sleeping, if\nshe's able.\n\n(NORA _comes in softly, and takes a bundle from under her shawl._)\n\nCATHLEEN (_spinning the wheel rapidly_). What is it you have?\n\nNOBA. The young priest is after bringing them. It's a shirt and a\nplain stocking were got off a drowned man in Donegal.\n\n(CATHLEEN _stops her wheel with a sudden movement, and leans out\nto listen._)\n\nNORA. We're to find out if it's Michael's they are; some time\nherself will be down looking by the sea.\n\nCATHLEEN. How would they be Michael's, Nora? How would he go the\nlength of that way to the far north?\n\nNORA. The young priest says he's known the like of it. \"If it's\nMichael's they are,\" says he, \"you can tell herself he's got a\nclean burial by the grace of God, and if they're not his, let no\none say a word about them, for she'll be getting her death,\" says\nhe, \"with crying and lamenting.\"\n\n(_The door which_ NORA _half closed is blown open by a gust of\nwind._)\n\nCATHLEEN (_looking out anxiously_). Did you ask him would he stop\nBartley going this day with the horses to the Galway fair?\n\nNORA. \"I won't stop him,\" says he, \"but let you not be afraid.\nHerself does be saying prayers half through the night, and the\nAlmighty God won't leave her destitute,\" says he, \"with no son\nliving.\"\n\nCATHLEEN. Is the sea bad by the white rocks, Nora?\n\nNORA. Middling bad, God help us. There's a great roaring in the\nwest, and it's worse it'll be getting when the tide's turned to\nthe wind.\n\n(_She goes over to the table with the bundle._)\n\nShall I open it now?\n\nCATHLEEN. Maybe she'd wake up on us, and come in before we'd\ndone. (_Coming to the table_) It's a long time we'll be, and the\ntwo of us crying.\n\nNORA (_goes to the inner door and listens_). She's moving about on\nthe bed. She'll be coming in a minute.\n\nCATHLEEN. Give me the ladder, and I'll put them up in the\nturf-loft, the way she won't know of them at all, and maybe when\nthe tide turns she'll be going down to see would he be floating\nfrom the east.\n\n(_They put the ladder against the gable of the chimney_; CATHLEEN\n_goes up a few steps and hides the bundle in the turf-loft. MAURYA\ncomes from the inner room._)\n\nMAURYA (_looking up at CATHLEEN and speaking querulously_). Isn't\nit turf enough you have for this day and evening?\n\nCATHLEEN. There's a cake baking at the fire for a short space\n(_throwing down the turf_) and Bartley will want it when the tide\nturns if he goes to Connemara.\n\n(NORA _picks up the turf and puts it round the pot-oven._)\n\nMAURYA (_sitting down on a stool at the fire_). He won't go this\nday with the wind rising from the south and west. He won't go\nthis day, for the young priest will stop him surely.\n\nNORA. He'll not stop him, mother, and I heard Eamon Simon and\nStephen Pheety and Colum Shawn saying he would go.\n\nMAURYA. Where is he itself?\n\nNORA. He went down to see would there be another boat sailing in\nthe week, and I'm thinking it won't be long till he's here now,\nfor the tide's turning at the green head, and the hooker's\ntacking from the east.\n\nCATHLEEN. I hear someone passing the big stones.\n\nNORA (_looking out_). He's coming now, and he in a hurry.\n\nBARTLEY (_comes in and looks round the room; speaking sadly and\nquietly_). Where is the bit of new rope, Cathleen, was bought in\nConnemara?\n\nCATHLEEN (_coming down_). Give it to him, Nora; it's on a nail by\nthe white boards. I hung it up this morning, for the pig with the\nblack feet was eating it.\n\nNORA (_giving him a rope_). Is that it, Bartley?\n\nMAURYA. You'd do right to leave that rope, Bartley, hanging by\nthe boards. (BARTLEY _takes the rope._) It will be wanting in this\nplace, I'm telling you, if Michael is washed up to-morrow\nmorning, or the next morning, or any morning in the week, for\nit's a deep grave we'll make him by the grace of God.\n\nBARTLEY (_beginning to work with the rope_). I've no halter the way\nI can ride down on the mare, and I must go now quickly. This is\nthe one boat going for two weeks or beyond it, and the fair will\nbe a good fair for horses, I heard them saying below.\n\nMAURYA. It's a hard thing they'll be saying below if the body is\nwashed up and there's no man in it to make the coffin, and I\nafter giving a big price for the finest white boards you'd find\nin Connemara.\n\n(_She looks round at the boards._)\n\nBARTLEY. How would it be washed up, and we after looking each day\nfor nine days, and a strong wind blowing a while back from the\nwest and south?\n\nMAURYA. If it wasn't found itself, that wind is raising the sea,\nand there was a star up against the moon, and it rising in the\nnight. If it was a hundred horses, or a thousand horses you had\nitself, what is the price of a thousand horses against a son\nwhere there is one son only?\n\nBARTLEY (_working at the halter, to_ CATHLEEN). Let you go down\neach day, and see the sheep aren't jumping in on the rye, and if\nthe jobber comes you can sell the pig with the black feet if\nthere is a good price going.\n\nMAURYA. How would the like of her get a good price for a pig?\n\nBARTLEY (_to_ CATHLEEN). If the west wind holds with the last bit\nof the moon let you and Nora get up weed enough for another cock\nfor the kelp. It's hard set we'll be from this day with no one in\nit but one man to work.\n\nMAURYA. It's hard set we'll be surely the day you're drownd'd\nwith the rest. What way will I live and the girls with me, and I\nan old woman looking for the grave?\n\n(BARTLEY _lays down the halter, takes off his old coat, and puts\non a newer one of the same flannel._)\n\nBARTLEY (_to_ NORA). Is she coming to the pier?\n\nNORA (_looking out_). She's passing the green head and letting fall\nher sails.\n\nBARTLEY (_getting his purse and tobacco_). I'll have half an hour\nto go down, and you'll see me coming again in two days, or in\nthree days, or maybe in four days if the wind is bad.\n\nMAURYA (_turning round to the fire, and putting her shawl over her\nhead_). Isn't it a hard and cruel man won't hear a word from an\nold woman, and she holding him from the sea?\n\nCATHLEEN. It's the life of a young man to be going on the sea,\nand who would listen to an old woman with one thing and she\nsaying it over?\n\nBARTLEY (_taking the halter_). I must go now quickly. I'll ride\ndown on the red mare, and the gray pony'll run behind me. The\nblessing of God on you.\n\n(_He goes out._)\n\nMAURYA (_crying out as he is in the door_). He's gone now, God\nspare us, and we'll not see him again. He's gone now, and when\nthe black night is falling I'll have no son left me in the world.\n\nCATHLEEN. Why wouldn't you give him your blessing and he looking\nround in the door? Isn't it sorrow enough is on everyone in this\nhouse without your sending him out with an unlucky word behind\nhim, and a hard word in his ear?\n\n(MAURYA _takes up the tongs and begins raking the fire aimlessly\nwithout looking round._)\n\nNORA (_turning towards her_). You're taking away the turf from the\ncake.\n\nCATHLEEN (_crying out_). The Son of God forgive us, Nora, we're\nafter forgetting his bit of bread.\n\n(_She comes over to the fire._)\n\nNORA. And it's destroyed he'll be going till dark night, and he\nafter eating nothing since the sun went up.\n\nCATHLEEN (_turning the cake out of the oven_). It's destroyed he'll\nbe, surely. There's no sense left on any person in a house where\nan old woman will be talking for ever.\n\n(MAURYA _sways herself on her stool._)\n\nCATHLEEN (_cutting off some of the bread and rolling it in a\ncloth, to_ MAURYA). Let you go down now to the spring well and\ngive him this and he passing. You'll see him then and the dark\nword will be broken, and you can say, \"God speed you,\" the way\nhe'll be easy in his mind.\n\nMAURYA (_taking the bread_). Will I be in it as soon as himself?\n\nCATHLEEN. If you go now quickly.\n\nMAURYA (_standing up unsteadily_). It's hard set I am to walk.\n\nCATHLEEN (_looking at her anxiously_). Give her the stick, Nora, or\nmaybe she'll slip on the big stones.\n\nNORA. What stick?\n\nCATHLEEN. The stick Michael brought from Connemara.\n\nMAURYA (_taking a stick NORA gives her_). In the big world the old\npeople do be leaving things after them for their sons and\nchildren, but in this place it is the young men do be leaving\nthings behind for them that do be old.\n\n(_She goes out slowly. NORA goes over to the ladder._)\n\nCATHLEEN. Wait, Nora, maybe she'd turn back quickly. She's that\nsorry, God help her, you wouldn't know the thing she'd do.\n\nNORA. Is she gone round by the bush?\n\nCATHLEEN (_looking out_). She's gone now. Throw it down quickly,\nfor the Lord knows when she'll be out of it again.\n\nNORA (_getting the bundle from the loft_). The young priest said\nhe'd be passing to-morrow, and we might go down and speak to him\nbelow if it's Michael's they are surely.\n\nCATHLEEN (_taking the bundle_). Did he say what way they were\nfound?\n\nNORA (_coming down_). \"There were two men,\" says he, \"and they\nrowing round with poteen before the cocks crowed, and the oar of\none of them caught the body, and they passing the black cliffs of\nthe north.\"\n\nCATHLEEN (_trying to open the bundle_). Give me a knife, Nora; the\nstring's perished with the salt water, and there's a black knot\non it you wouldn't loosen in a week.\n\nNORA (_giving her a knife_). I've heard tell it was a long way to\nDonegal.\n\nCATHLEEN (_cutting the string_). It is surely. There was a man in\nhere a while ago--the man sold us that knife--and he said if you\nset off walking from the rocks beyond, it would be seven days\nyou'd be in Donegal.\n\nNORA. And what time would a man take, and he floating?\n\n(CATHLEEN _opens the bundle and takes out a bit of a stocking.\nThey look at them eagerly._)\n\nCATHLEEN (_in a low voice_). The Lord spare us, Nora! Isn't it a\nqueer hard thing to say if it's his they are surely?\n\nNORA. I'll get his shirt off the hook the way we can put the one\nflannel on the other. (_She looks through some clothes hanging in\nthe corner_) It's not with them, Cathleen, and where will it be?\n\nCATHLEEN. I'm thinking Bartley put it on him in the morning, for\nhis own shirt was heavy with the salt in it. (_Pointing to the\ncorner_) There's a bit of a sleeve was of the same stuff. Give me\nthat and it will do.\n\n(NORA _brings it to her and they compare the flannel._)\n\nCATHLEEN. It's the same stuff, Nora; but if it is itself, aren't\nthere great rolls of it in the shops of Galway, and isn't it many\nanother man may have a shirt of it as well as Michael himself?\n\nNORA (_who has taken up the stocking and counted the stitches,\ncrying out_) It's Michael, Cathleen, it's Michael; God spare his\nsoul and what will herself say when she hears this story, and\nBartley on the sea?\n\nCATHLEEN (_taking the stocking_). It's a plain stocking.\n\nNORA. It's the second one of the third pair I knitted, and I put\nup three score stitches, and I dropped four of them.\n\nCATHLEEN (_counts the stitches_). It's that number is in it.\n(_Crying out_) Ah, Nora, isn't it a bitter thing to think of him\nfloating that way to the far north, and no one to keen him but\nthe black hags that do be flying on the sea?\n\nNORA (_swinging herself round, and throwing out her arms on the\nclothes_). And isn't it a pitiful thing when there is nothing left\nof a man who was a great rower and fisher, but a bit of an old\nshirt and a plain stocking?\n\nCATHLEEN (_after an instant_). Tell me is herself coming, Nora? I\nhear a little sound on the path.\n\nNORA (_looking out_). She is, Cathleen. She's coming up to the\ndoor.\n\nCATHLEEN. Put these things away before she'll come in. Maybe it's\neasier she'll be after giving her blessing to Bartley, and we\nwon't let on we've heard anything the time he's on the sea.\n\nNORA (_helping CATHLEEN to close the bundle_). We'll put them here\nin the corner.\n\n(_They put them into a hole in the chimney corner. CATHLEEN goes\nback to the spinning wheel._)\n\nNORA. Will she see it was crying I was?\n\nCATHLEEN. Keep your back to the door the way the light'll not be\non you.\n\n(NORA _sits down at the chimney corner, with her back to the door._\nMAURYA _comes in very slowly, without looking at the girls, and\ngoes over to her stool at the other side of the fire. The cloth\nwith the bread is still in her hand. The girls look at each\nother, and_ NORA _points to the bundle of bread._)\n\nCATHLEEN (_offer spinning for a moment_), You didn't give him his\nbit of bread?\n\n(MAURYA _begins to keen softly, without turning round._)\n\nCATHLEEN. Did you see him riding down?\n\n(MAURYA _goes on keening._)\n\nCATHLEEN (_a little impatiently_). God forgive you; isn't it a\nbetter thing to raise your voice and tell what you seen, than to\nbe making lamentation for a thing that's done? Did you see\nBartley, I'm saying to you.\n\nMAURYA (_with a weak voice_). My heart's broken from this day.\n\nCATHLEEN (_as before_). Did you see Bartley?\n\nMAURYA. I seen the fearfulest thing.\n\nCATHLEEN (_leaves her wheel and looks out_). God forgive you; he's\nriding the mare now over the green head, and the gray pony behind\nhim.\n\nMAURYA (_starts, so that her shawl falls back from her head and\nshows her white tossed hair; with a frightened voice_). The gray\npony behind him.\n\nCATHLEEN (_coming to the fire_). What is it ails you, at all?\n\nMAURYA (_speaking very slowly_). I've seen the fearfulest thing any\nperson has seen, since the day Bride Dara seen the dead man with\nthe child in his arms.\n\nCATHLEEN AND NORA. Uah.\n\n(_They crouch down in front of the old woman at the fire._)\n\nNORA. Tell us what it is you seen.\n\nMAURYA. I went down to the spring-well, and I stood there saying\na prayer to myself. Then Bartley came along, and he riding on the\nred mare with the gray pony behind him. (_She puts up her hands,\nas if to hide something from her eyes._) The Son of God spare us,\nNora!\n\nCATHLEEN. What is it you seen?\n\nMAURYA. I seen Michael himself.\n\nCATHLEEN (_speaking softly_). You did not, mother; it wasn't\nMichael you seen, for his body is after being found in the far\nnorth, and he's got a clean burial by the grace of God.\n\nMAURYA (_a little defiantly_). I'm after seeing him this day, and\nhe riding and galloping. Bartley came first on the red mare; and\nI tried to say \"God speed you,\" but something choked the words in\nmy throat. He went by quickly; and, \"The blessing of God on you,\"\nsays he, and I could say nothing. I looked up then, and I crying,\nat the gray pony, and there was Michael upon it--with fine\nclothes on him, and new shoes on his feet.\n\nCATHLEEN (_begins to keen_). It's destroyed we are from this day.\nIt's destroyed, surely.\n\nNORA. Didn't the young priest say the Almighty God wouldn't leave\nher destitute with no son living?\n\nMAUKYA (_in a low voice, but clearly_). It's little the like of him\nknows of the sea.... Bartley will be lost now, and let you call\nin Eamon and make me a good coffin out of the white boards, for I\nwon't live after them. I've had a husband, and a husband's\nfather, and six sons in this house--six fine men, though it was a\nhard birth I had with every one of them and they coming to the\nworld--and some of them were found and some of them were not\nfound, but they're gone now, the lot of them.... There were\nStephen, and Shawn, were lost in the great wind, and found after\nin the Bay of Gregory of the Golden Mouth, and carried up the two\nof them on the one plank, and in by that door.\n\n(_She pauses for a moment, the girls start as if they heard\nsomething through the door that is half-open behind them._)\n\nNORA (_in a whisper_). Did you hear that, Cathleen? Did you hear a\nnoise in the northeast?\n\nCATHLEEN (_in a whisper_). There's someone after crying out by the\nseashore.\n\nMAURYA (_continues without hearing anything_). There was Sheamus\nand his father, and his own father again, were lost in a dark\nnight, and not a stick or sign was seen of them when the sun went\nup. There was Patch after was drowned out of a curagh that turned\nover. I was sitting here with Bartley, and he a baby, lying on my\ntwo knees, and I seen two women, and three women, and four women\ncoming in, and they crossing themselves, and not saying a word. I\nlooked out then, and there were men coming after them, and they\nholding a thing in the half of a red sail, and water dripping out\nof it--it was a dry day, Nora--and leaving a track to the door.\n\n(_She pauses again with her hand stretched out towards the door.\nIt opens softly and old women begin to come in, crossing\nthemselves on the threshold, and kneeling down in front of the\nstage with red petticoats over their heads._)\n\nMAURYA (_half in a dream, to Cathleen_). Is it Patch, or Michael,\nor what is it at all?\n\nCATHLEEN. Michael is after being found in the far north, and when\nhe is found there how could he be here in this place?\n\nMAURYA. There does be a power of young men floating round in the\nsea, and what way would they know if it was Michael they had, or\nanother man like him, for when a man is nine days in the sea, and\nthe wind blowing, it's hard set his own mother would be to say\nwhat man was it.\n\nCATHLEEN. It's Michael, God spare him, for they're after sending\nus a bit of his clothes from the far north.\n\n(_She reaches out and hands MAURYA the clothes that belonged to_\nMICHAEL. MAURYA _stands up slowly, and takes them in her hands._\nNORA _looks out._)\n\nNORA. They're carrying a thing among them and there's water\ndripping out of it and leaving a track by the big stones.\n\nCATHLEEN (_in a whisper to the women who have come in_). Is it\nBartley it is?\n\nONE OF THE WOMEN. It is surely, God rest his soul.\n\n(_Two younger women come in and pull out the table. Then men carry\nin the body of_ BARTLEY, _laid on a plank, with a bit of a sail\nover it, and lay it on the table._)\n\nCATHLEEN (_to the women, as they are doing so_). What way was he\ndrowned?\n\nONE OF THE WOMEN. The gray pony knocked him into the sea, and he\nwas washed out where there is a great surf on the white rocks.\n\n(MAURYA _has gone over and knelt down at the head of the table.\nThe women are keening softly and swaying themselves with a slow\nmovement._ CATHLEEN _and_ NORA _kneel at the other end of the table.\nThe men kneel near the door._)\n\nMAURYA (_raising her head and speaking as if she did not see the\npeople around her_). They're all gone now, and there isn't\nanything more the sea can do to me.... I'll have no call now to\nbe up crying and praying when the wind breaks from the south, and\nyou can hear the surf is in the east, and the surf is in the\nwest, making a great stir with the two noises, and they hitting\none on the other. I'll have no call now to be going down and\ngetting Holy Water in the dark nights after Samhain, and I won't\ncare what way the sea is when the other women will be keening.\n(_To_ NORA) Give me the Holy Water, Nora; there's a small sup still\non the dresser.\n\n(NORA _gives it to her._)\n\nMAURYA (_drops_ MICHAEL'S _clothes across_ BARTLEY'S _feet, and\nsprinkles the Holy Water over him_). It isn't that I haven't\nprayed for you, BARTLEY, to the Almighty God. It isn't that I\nhaven't said prayers in the dark night till you wouldn't know\nwhat I'd be saying; but it's a great rest I'll have now, and it's\ntime surely. It's a great rest I'll have now, and great sleeping\nin the long nights after Samhain, if it's only a bit of wet flour\nwe do have to eat, and maybe a fish that would be stinking.\n\n(_She kneels down again, crossing herself, and saying prayers\nunder her breath._)\n\nCATHLEEN (_to an old man_). Maybe yourself and Eamon would make a\ncoffin when the sun rises. We have fine white boards herself\nbought, God help her, thinking Michael would be found, and I have\na new cake you can eat while you'll be working.\n\nTHE OLD MAN (_looking at the boards_). Are there nails with them?\n\nCATHLEEN. There are not, Colum; we didn't think of the nails.\n\nANOTHER MAN. It's a great wonder she wouldn't think of the nails,\nand all the coffins she's seen made already.\n\nCATHLEEN. It's getting old she is, and broken.\n\n(MAURYA _stands up again very slowly and spreads out the pieces of_\nMICHAEL'S _clothes beside the body, sprinkling them with the last\nof the Holy Water._)\n\nNORA (_in a whisper to_ CATHLEEN). She's quiet now and easy; but\nthe day Michael was drowned you could hear her crying out from\nthis to the spring-well. It's fonder she was of Michael, and\nwould anyone have thought that?\n\nCATHLEEN (_slowly and clearly_). An old woman will be soon tired\nwith anything she will do, and isn't it nine days herself is\nafter crying and keening, and making great sorrow in the house?\n\nMAURYA (_puts the empty cup mouth downwards on the table, and lays\nher hands together on_ BARTLEY'S _feet_). They're all together this\ntime, and the end is come. May the Almighty God have mercy on\nBartley's soul, and on Michael's soul, and on the souls of\nSheamus and Patch, and Stephen and Shawn (_bending her head_); and\nmay He have mercy on my soul, Nora, and on the soul of everyone\nis left living in the world.\n\n(_She pauses, and the keen rises a little more loudly from the\nwomen, then sinks away._)\n\nMAURYA (_continuing_). Michael has a clean burial in the far north,\nby the grace of the Almighty God. Bartley will have a fine coffin\nout of the white boards, and a deep grave surely. What more can\nwe want than that? No man at all can be living for ever, and we\nmust be satisfied.\n\n(_She kneels down again, and the curtain falls slowly_).\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAND OF HEART'S DESIRE[1]\n\nWilliam Butler Yeats\n\n[Footnote 1: Reprinted by arrangement with Mr. Yeats and the\nMacmillan Company, New York, publishers of Mr. Yeats's Collected\nWorks (1912).]\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nMAURTEEN BRUIN\nBRIDGET BRUIN, his wife\nSHAWN BRUIN, their son\nMAIRE BRUIN, wife of Shawn\nFATHER HART\nA FAERY CHILD\n\nSCENE: _In the Barony of Kilmacowan, in the county of Sligo, at a\nremote time._\n\nSETTING: _a room with a hearth on the floor in the middle of a\ndeep alcove on the right. There are benches in the alcove, and a\ntable; a crucifix on the wall. The alcove is full of a glow of\nlight from the fire. There is an open door facing the audience,\nto the left, and to the left of this a bench. Through the door\none can see the forest. It is night, but the moon or a late\nsunset glimmers through the trees, and carries the eye far off\ninto a vague, mysterious world. MAURTEEN BRUIN, SHAWN BRUIN, and\nBRIDGET BRUIN sit in the alcove at the table, or about the fire.\nThey are dressed in the costume of some remote time, and near\nthem sits an old priest, FATHER HART, in the garb of a friar.\nThere is food and drink upon the table. MAIRE BRUIN stands by the\ndoor, reading a yellow manuscript. If she looks up, she can see\nthrough the door into the wood._\n\n\n                        BRIDGET BRUIN\n  Because I bade her go and feed the calves,\n  She took that old book down out of the thatch\n  And has been doubled over it all day.\n  We should be deafened by her groans and moans\n  Had she to work as some do, Father Hart,\n  Get up at dawn like me, and mend and scour;\n  Or ride abroad in the boisterous night like you,\n  The pyx and blessed bread under your arm.\n\n                        SHAWN BRUIN\n  You are too cross.\n\n                        BRIDGET BRUIN\n                        The young side with the young.\n\n                        MAURTEEN BRUIN\n  She quarrels with my wife a bit at times,\n  And is too deep just now in the old book!\n  But do not blame her greatly; she will grow\n  As quiet as a puff-ball in a tree\n  When but the moons of marriage dawn and die\n  For half a score of times.\n\n                        FATHER HART\n                                Their hearts are wild\n  As be the hearts of birds, till children come.\n\n                        BRIDGET BRUIN\n  She would not mind the griddle, milk the cow,\n  Or even lay the knives and spread the cloth.\n\n                        FATHER HART\n  I never saw her read a book before;\n  What may it be?\n\n                        MAURTEEN BRUIN\n                      I do not rightly know;\n  It has been in the thatch for fifty years.\n  My father told me my grandfather wrote it,\n  Killed a red heifer and bound it with the hide.\n  But draw your chair this way--supper is spread;\n  And little good he got out of the book,\n  Because it filled his house with roaming bards,\n  And roaming ballad-makers and the like,\n  And wasted all his goods.--Here is the wine:\n  The griddle bread's beside you, Father Hart.\n  Colleen, what have you got there in the book\n  That you must leave the bread to cool? Had I,\n  Or had my father, read or written books\n  There were no stocking stuffed with golden guineas\n  To come, when I am dead, to Shawn and you.\n\n                        FATHER HART\n  You should not fill your head with foolish dreams.\n  What are you reading?\n\n                        MARIE BRUIN\n                           How a Princess Edane,\n  A daughter of a King of Ireland, heard\n  A voice singing on a May Eve like this,\n  And followed, half awake and half asleep,\n  Until she came into the Land of Fa\u00ebry,\n  Where nobody gets old and godly and grave,\n  Where nobody gets old and crafty and wise,\n  Where nobody gets old and bitter of tongue;\n  And she is still there, busied with a dance,\n  Deep in the dewy shadow of a wood,\n  Or where stars walk upon a mountain-top.\n\n                        MAURTEEN BRUIN\n  Persuade the colleen to put by the book:\n  My grandfather would mutter just such things,\n  And he was no judge of a dog or horse,\n  And any idle boy could blarney him:\n  Just speak your mind.\n\n                        FATHER HART\n                          Put it away, my colleen.\n  God spreads the heavens above us like great wings,\n  And gives a little round of deeds and days,\n  And then come the wrecked angels and set snares,\n  And bait them with light hopes and heavy dreams,\n  Until the heart is puffed with pride and goes,\n  Half shuddering and half joyous, from God's peace:\n  And it was some wrecked angel, blind from tears,\n  Who flattered Edane's heart with merry words.\n  My colleen, I have seen some other girls\n  Restless and ill at ease, but years went by\n  And they grew like their neighbours and were glad\n  In minding children, working at the churn,\n  And gossiping of weddings and of wakes;\n  For life moves out of a red flare of dreams\n  Into a common light of common hours,\n  Until old age bring the red flare again.\n\n                        MAURTEEN BRUIN\n  That's true--but she's too young to know it's true.\n\n                        BRIDGET BRUIN\n  She's old enough to know that it is wrong\n  To mope and idle.\n\n                        SHAWN BRUIN\n                      I've little blame for her;\n  And mother's tongue were harder still to bear,\n  But for her fancies: this is May Eve too,\n  When the good people post about the world,\n  And surely one may think of them to-night.\n  Maire, have you the primroses to fling\n  Before the door to make a golden path\n  For them to bring good luck into the house?\n  Remember, they may steal new-married brides\n  After the fall of twilight on May Eve.\n\n    (MAIRE BRUIN _goes over to the window and takes flowers\n      from the bowl and strews them outside the door._)\n\n                        FATHER HART\n  You do well, daughter, because God permits\n  Great power to the good people on May Eve.\n\n                        SHAWN BRUIN\n  They can work all their will with primroses;\n  Change them to golden

In one place a\npanel slid aside shews a shut bed._\n\n_In front of the panelling are two long benches with a carved\nhigh-seat between them. Across the end of the hall are similar\npanellings and the seats, with corresponding tables, of the\nwomen's dais; behind these and in the gable wall is a high narrow\ndoor with a rounded top._\n\n_A timber roof slopes down to the side wall and is upheld by\ncross-beams and two rows of tall pillars which make a rather\nnarrow nave of the centre of the hall. One of these rows runs\nparallel to the side wall, the pair of pillars before the\nhigh-seat being carved and ended with images; of the other row\nonly two pillars are visible at the extreme right._\n\n_Within this nave is the space for the hearths; but the only\nhearth visible is the one near the women's dais. In the roof\nabove it there is a louvre: the fire glows and no smoke rises.\nThe hall is lit everywhere by the firelight._\n\n_The rafters over the women's dais carry a floor at the level of\nthe side walls, forming an open loft which is reached by a wide\nladder fixed against the wall: a bed is seen in this loft. Low in\nthe roof at intervals are shuttered casements, one being above\nthe loft: all the shutters are closed.

What forces favor these desires,\nand what oppose them--for instance, David Pirnie's determination\nto tell wee Alexander a bit story, in _The Philosopher of\nButterbiggens_? Can you always put any one character altogether\non one side? Or does his own weakness or carelessness or\nstupidity, for example, sometimes work against his getting what\nhe wants, so that he is, in part, _not_ on his own side, but\nagainst it, as Brutus is in _Julius Caesar_? Are there other\nforces in the play besides the people--storm or accident or fate?\nWith what side or what character are you in sympathy? Is this\nconstant throughout the play, or do you feel a change at some\npoint in it? Does the author sympathize with any special\ncharacter? Does he have a prejudice against any one of them? For\nexample, in _Campbell of Kilmhor_, where is your sympathy? Where\nis the author's, apparently?\n\n\n2. _The Beginning and the End._\n\nWhat events important to this play occurred before the curtain\nrises? Why does the author begin just here, and not earlier or\nlater? How does he contrive to let you know these important\nthings without coming before the curtain to announce them\nhimself, or having two servants dusting the furniture and telling\nthem to each other?\n\nWhat happens _after_ the curtain falls? Can you go on picturing\nthese events? Are any of them important to the story--for\ninstance, in _The Beggar and the King_? Why did the author stop\nbefore telling us these things?\n\nDoes the ending satisfy you? Even if you do not find it happy and\nenjoyable, does it seem the natural and perhaps the inevitable\nresult of the forces at work--in _Riders to the Sea_ and\n_Campbell of Kilmhor_, for instance? Or has the author interfered\nto make characters do what they would not naturally do, or used\nchance and coincidence, like the accidentally discovered will or\nthe long-lost relative in melodramas, to bring about a result he\nprefers--a \"happy ending,\" or a clap-trap surprise, or a supposed\nproof of some theory about politics or morals?\n\nDoes the interest mount steadily from beginning to end, or does\nit droop and fail somewhere? You may find it interesting to try\ndrawing the diagram of interest for a play, as suggested in\nchapter X of Dr. Brander Matthews's _Study of the Drama_, and\naccounting for the drop in interest, if you find any.\n\n\n3. _The Playwright's Purpose._\n\nWhat was the author trying to do in writing the play? It may have\nbeen:--\n\nMerely to tell a good story To paint a picture of life in the\nArran Islands or in old France or in a modern industrial town To\nshow us character and its development, as in novels like\nThackeray's and Eliot's (Of course, brief plays like these cannot\nshow development of character, but only critical points in such\ndevelopment--the result of forces perhaps long at work, or the\nawakening of new ideas and other determinants of character.) To\nportray a social situation, such as the relation between workmen\nand employers, or between men and women To show the inevitable\neffects of action and motive, as of the determined loyalty of\nDugald Stewart and his mother, or the battle of fisher-folk or\nweavers with grinding poverty.\n\nOf course, no play will probably do any one of these things\nexclusively, but usually each is concerned most with some one\npurpose.\n\nWhat effect has the play on you? Even if its tragedy is painful\nor its account of human character makes you uncomfortable, is it\ngood for you to realize these things, or merely uselessly\nunpleasant? Is the play stupidly and falsely cheering because it\npresents untrue \"happy endings\" or other distortions of things as\nthey are? Do you think the play has merely temporary, or genuine\nand permanent, appeal?\n\n\n\n\nNOTES ON THE DRAMAS AND THE DRAMATISTS\n\n\n_Harold Chapin_: THE PHILOSOPHER OF BUTTERBIGGENS\n\nHarold Chapin, as we learn from _Soldier and Dramatist_ (Lane,\n1917), was an American both by ancestry and nativity. But he\nlived the greater part of his life in England, and died for\nEngland at Loos in April, 1915. His activity was always\nassociated with the stage. When he was but seven years old he\nplayed the little Marcius to his mother's Volumnia at the\nShakespeare Festival, at Stratford-on-Avon in 1893. In 1911 he\nproduced Mr. Harold Brighouse's _Lonesome-Like_ and several of\nhis own short plays at the Glasgow Repertory Theatre. For several\nyears before the war he was Mr. Granville Barker's stage manager,\nand helped him to produce the beautiful Shakespearean plays at\nthe Savoy Theatre in London.\n\nOf Chapin's own dramas, _The New Morality_ and _Art and\nOpportunity_ have been given recently in New York and in London,\nand several of the one-act plays at a memorial performance in\nLondon in 1916, in matin\u00e9e at the Punch and Judy Theatre, and\nbefore the Drama League in New York in March and April, 1921. Of\nthe shorter plays, mentioned in the bibliographies following\nthese notes, _It's the Poor that 'elps the Poor, The Dumb and\nthe Blind, and The Philosopher of Butterbiggens_ have been\ngiven the highest praise by such critics as Mr. William Archer,\nwho wrote, \"No English-speaking man of more unquestionable genius\nhas been lost to the world in this world-frenzy.\" These true and\nhonest dramas represent the English Repertory theatres at their\nbest in this brief form, and give promise of the great and\npermanently interesting \"human comedy\" which Chapin might have\ncompleted had his life not been sacrificed. In spite of the\nsimplicity and lightness of the little play here given, there is\nmore shrewd philosophy in old David Pirnie, and more real\nhumanity in his family, than is to be found portrayed in many\npretentious social dramas and difficult psychological novels. It\nis admirable on the stage, as was shown by the Provincetown\nPlayers last winter. In the memorial performance for Harold\nChapin in London, the author's little son appeared in the part of\nwee Alexander.\n\n\"Butterbiggens,\" Mrs. Alice Chapin, the dramatist's mother,\nreplied to an inquiry as to \"what Butterbiggens is or are,\" \"is,\nare, and always will be a suburb of Glasgow.\"\n\nThere is little difficulty with the modified Scots dialect in\nthis play if one remembers that _ae_ generally takes the place of\nsuch sounds as _e_ in _tea_, _o_ in _so_, _a_ in _have_, and so\non, and that _a'_ means _all_. A _wean_ is a small _bairn_,\n_yinst_ is _once_, _ava_ is _at all_, and _thrang_ is \"thick\" or\nintimate.\n\n_Distempered_ means calcimined, or painted in water-dissolved\ncolor on the plaster.\n\n\n_Lady Gregory_: SPREADING THE NEWS\n\nIn her notes on the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, which she was most\ninfluential in building up, Lady Augusta Gregory says that it was\nthe desire of the players and writers who worked there to\nestablish an Irish drama which should have a \"firm base in\nreality and an apex of beauty.\" This phrase, which admirably\nexpresses the best in the play-making going on to-day, finds most\nadequate illustration in the work of Synge, of Yeats, and of Lady\nGregory herself. The basis in reality of such jolly and robust\ncomedies as her _Seven Irish Plays_ and _New Irish Comedies_ is\nclearly discernible. They are in the tradition of the best early\nEnglish comedy, from the miracle plays onward; of Hans Sachs's\n_Shrovetide Plays_, and of Moli\u00e8re's dramatizations of medieaval\n_fabliaux_, as in _The Physician in Spite of Himself_. Lady\nGregory describes in her notes on _Spreading the News_ how the\nplay grew out of an idea of picturing tragic consequences from\nidle rumor and defamation of character. It is certainly not to be\nregretted that she allowed \"laughter to have its way with the\nlittle play,\" and gave Bartley Fallon a share of glory from the\nwoeful day to illuminate dull, older years.\n\nThe inhabitants of this same village of Cloon appear as old\nfriends in other of Lady Gregory's plays, with, as usual, nothing\nto do but mind one another's business. In _The Jackdaw_ another\nabsurd rumor is fanned into full blaze by greed; upon _Hyacinth\nHalvey_ works the potent and embarrassing influence of too good a\nreputation. Still other plays attain a notable height of\nbeauty--notably _The Rising of the Moon_ and _The Traveling Man_.\n_The Gaol Gate_ tells a story similar to that of _Campbell of\nKilmhor_, with genuinely tragic effect. She has written, besides,\ntwo volumes of Irish folk-history, _Gods and Fighting Men_ and\n_Cuchulain of Muirthemne_, which Mr. Yeats calls masterpieces of\nprose which one \"can weigh with Malory and feel no discontent at\nthe tally.\"[1] A writer who has produced such range and beauty of\nworks, from very human, characteristic comedy and farce to fine,\npoignant tragedy, besides writing excellent stories and\ncontributing largely to an important experimental theatre, is\nsecure of her share of fame.\n\nThe \"Removable Magistrate\" is apparently one appointed by British\nofficialdom; this one, having just come from the Bay of Bengal,\nis going to fit upon the natives of Cloon methods which may have\nworked in a rather different district.\n\nThe song \"with a skin on it,\" which Bartley sings, is given in\nLady Gregory's _Seven Short Plays_ (Putnam, 1909).\n\n[Footnote 1: Appendix to _The Poetical Works of William B.\nYeats_, volume II, (Macmillan, 1912).]\n\n\n_Winthrop Parkhurst_: THE BEGGAR AND THE KING\n\n_The Beggar and the King_ looks at first like a pleasant\nabsurdity; it is in reality valuable as a short history of the\nostrich method of dealing with realities. The beggar, of course,\ncontinues to cry aloud after his tongue, and even his head, have\nbeen removed, because there are so many millions of him. Again\nand again, in the course of history, he has gathered desperate\ncourage to defy authority that is blind and evil. Always at last,\nas in the French and the Russian revolutions and in the more\nrecent European revolts, he succeeds in wresting the power from\nthose in autocratic authority. And yet, just as of old, not only\nkings, but all others who attempt dictatorship and the playing of\nprovidence, try the simple tactics of the ostrich; they close the\nwindow, or their eyes and ears, as a sufficient answer to\nrebellion. Appreciating the futility of these methods, we have no\ndifficulty in continuing the drama ourselves beyond the fall of\nthe curtain.\n\nMr. Winthrop Parkhurst, by birth a New Yorker, according to a\nfamily tradition is a descendant on his mother's side of John\nHuss, the Bohemian reformer and martyr, and on his father's of\nthe executioner of Charles I of England. His writings include\n_Maracca_, a Biblical one-act play, and several short satirical\nsketches.\n\n\n_George Middleton_: TIDES\n\nMr. George Middleton generally pictures in his dramas problems\nwhich are not easy to solve. And he does not try to give\nready-made solutions. He merely shows us how various people have\ntried to work these problems; and his dramas are like real life\nbecause the attempts at solutions fail as often as they succeed.\nCertain of the problems Mr. Middleton presents are such as\nhigh-school students meet and can well consider; several of these\nplays appear in the lists following. _Tides_ is about a man who\nhas supported an unpopular theory. Nothing is said about whether\nhis ideal is right or wrong, but it is clear that he has held to\nit in perfect sincerity of belief and has been quite unmoved by\nthe bitterest persecution. But when he is offered honor and\nflattering respect, though he does not really change his belief\nand adherence, he compromises and partially surrenders his ideal.\nThe fable is similar to that of Ibsen's _The League of Youth_,\nbut the telling here is straighter and clearer. William White's\nself-deception is made evident to him and to us by his honest and\ncourageous wife, who tells him frankly of it. \"Haven't you\nsometimes noticed that is what bitterness to another means: a\nfailure within oneself?\" she comments wisely. An effective\ncontrast is furnished by the son, who has altogether and honestly\nabandoned his father's theories in the face of new realities as\nhe sees them.\n\n\n_Eugene O'Neill_: ILE\n\nEugene O'Neill, American seaman, laborer, newspaperman, and\ndramatist, has been associated for several years with the\nProvincetown Players. This group, including Mrs. Glaspell and\nother playwrights of importance, gather in Provincetown, on Cape\nCod, during the summer, and in winter present significant foreign\nand native plays in a converted stable on Macdougall Street in\nNew York, where may be seen the ring to which Pegasus was once\ntethered! In 1919 Mr. O'Neill received the Pulitzer Prize for the\nmost important American play of the year.\n\nMr. O'Neill has had experience of the sea, like the great\nEnglishmen, Mr. Masefield and Mr. Joseph Conrad. He knows the\ninterminable whaling voyages, as described in Melville's _Moby_\n_Dick_ and the first chapter of _Typee_--best of all in Bullen's\n_Cruise of the Cachalot_. Out of this experience of hard life and\nharder men he has written many poignant and terrible dramas--perhaps\nthe greatest this story of the skipper's wife who insisted on\nmaking the voyage with her husband and is worn to the edge of\ninsanity by months of ice-bound solitude. The motive of Captain\nKeeney is like that which caused Skipper Ireson to leave his\nfellow townsmen to sink in Chaleur Bay. Against his iron\ndetermination his wife's piteous pleading and evident suffering\nare more potent than the mutinying hands; whether she can avail\nto turn him home \"with a measly four hundred barrel of ile\" is\nthe problem of the play.\n\n\n_J.A. Ferguson_: CAMPBELL OF KILMHOR\n\nThis tragic story of the war and hatred in Scotland belongs in\nthe series of attempts made by Charles Edward Stuart and his\nfather to regain the throne lost by James II in 1688. \"The Young\nPretender's\" vigorous campaign in 1745, carried far into England,\nmight easily have succeeded but for the quarrels and disaffection\nof the Highland chiefs who supported him. His failure was\ncompleted at the bloody battle of Culloden, or Drumossie Moor, in\n1746, celebrated in Scottish story and song of lamentation.\nScott's hero Waverley went into the highland country shortly\nafter these uprisings, and David Balfour, in _Kidnapped_, had\nnumerous adventures in crossing it with Allan Breck Stewart, who\nwas in the service of his kinsmen, the exiled Stuarts. The hatred\nof Campbells and Stuarts, of Lowlander and Highlander, Loyalist\nand Jacobite, is intense throughout the record of those days.\n\nThe young Scot and his stanch and proudly tearless mother are, of\ncourse, the heroic characters in the play. We have a hint that\nCharles Edward Stuart himself is with the band whom the young man\nprotects so loyally. It may seem strange that the drama is named,\nnot for him, but for the crafty and pitiless executioner of the\nking's justice. But he is after all the most interesting\ncharacter in the piece, with his Biblical references in broad\nLowland Scots (we may suppose that the Stewarts speak Gaelic\namong themselves), his superstition, his remorseless cruelty. We\nshould like to see how he takes the discovery that, perhaps for\nthe first time, he has been baffled in his career of unscrupulous\nand bloody deeds!\n\nThis play represents the most successful work of the Glasgow\nRepertory Theatre in 1914. The author has written no others which\nhave been published, though he is credited with a good story or\ntwo. It may be hoped that he will write other dramas as excellent\nas this one. He has put into very brief and effective form here\nthe spirit and idea of a most intense period of merciless\nconflict.\n\nA _kebbuck_ is a cheese; _keek_ means peek; _toom_, empty; a\n_besom_, a broom; and _soop_, sweep.\n\n\n_John Galsworthy_: THE SUN\n\nAccording to Professor Lewisohn and other critics Mr. Galsworthy\nis without question the foremost English dramatist to-day.\nWithout arguing or attempting to offer solutions, he gives the\nmost searching presentation of problems which we have to face and\nsomehow settle. In _Strife_, after a furious contest and bitter\nhardships, the strike is settled by a compromise which the\nleaders of both sides count as failure. Things are much as they\nwere at the start; the difficulty is no nearer solution. In\n_Justice_, \"society stamps out a human life not without its fair\npossibilities--for eighty-one pounds,\" because obviously clear\nand guilty infraction of law cannot go unavenged. Justice is not\ncondemned by the facts shown in this play, nor is its working\nextolled. In _The Mob_, the patrioteering element destroys a man\nwho proclaims the injustice of a small and greedy war of\nconquest. In _The Pigeon_, brilliant debate is held, but no\nconclusion reached, as to what we should do with derelict and\nwasted lives, with men who do not fit into the scheme of success\nand society.\n\nIn his sketches and stories Mr. Galsworthy presents these same\nproblems, and again without attempted conclusions. _The\nFreelands_ particularly is a most dramatic novel of conditions\nand results similar to those in some of the dramas mentioned\nabove. Many of his sketches and essays also--for example, \"My\nDistant Relative\" in _The Inn of Tranquillity_ and \"Comfort\" in\n_A Commentary_--are of biting and almost cynical irony in viewing\nproposed and present solutions of problems; but none suggest\npanaceas. They merely make us think soberly of the size of our\nproblems and their immense complexity, move us to go out to look\nfor more information and to examine carefully our most solid\ninstitutions as well as suggested alterations in them.\n\nA large part of Mr. Galsworthy's time and thought, both during\nthe war and since, has been given to the problem of some measure\nof justice to soldiers, and particularly to wounded and broken\nsoldiers. In _A Sheaf_ and _Another Sheaf_ appear various papers\npresenting sharply the conditions of suffering and neglect that\nactually exist. _The Sun_ is a brief sketch of after-war\ndays,--this time of a wounded man who has gained an advantage\nover one who escaped injury,--and of joy in deliverance from the\nhell of war--a joy so profound and luminous that the released\nsoldier cannot let a sharp mischance and disappointment mar his\nhappiness. The whole piece is in the key of Captain Bassoon's\nverses after the Armistice:--\n\n  \"Every one suddenly burst out singing.\"\n\nThe other two think the happy soldier mad. We are left wondering\nwhat the reaction will be from this height of joyful release to\nthe harsh and sombre conditions of workingmen's life after the\npeace.\n\nThe _silver badge_ represents a discharge for wounds. _Crumps_\nare, of course, shells.\n\n\n_Louise Sounders_: THE KNAVE OF HEARTS\n\n_The Knave of Hearts_ is one of the happy tradition of\npuppet-plays, which come down in unbroken line from the most\nancient history, through the illustrious Dr. Faustus and Mr.\nPunch, to new and even greater favor and fame to-day. For just as\nthe ancient puppet-shows of Italy and England seemed to be losing\nground before the moving-picture invasion, they have been\nheroically rescued by Mr. Tony Sarg,--whose performance of\nThackeray's _The Rose and the Ring_ is perfectly absurd and\ncaptivating,--and by other excellent artists.\n\nPuppet-shows are delightful because they are easily made and\nquite convincing. Very good ones have been improvised even by\ntiny children, with a pasteboard suit-box opening to the front, a\nslit at the top to let down paper-doll actors on a thread, a bit\nof scenery, outdoors or in, drawn as background, and a showman to\ntalk for all the characters. Still better puppets are doll heads\nand arms of various sorts, dressed in flowing robes and provided\nwith holes for two fingers and a thumb of the operator, who moves\nthem from below. They can be made to dance and antic as you like\non a stage above the showman's head, as Punch and Judy have\nalways done. The more elaborate marionettes are worked with\nstrings from above, so that they can open and close their mouths\nand otherwise act most realistically; these are, of course, more\ndifficult, but quite possible to make. In such simple theatres,\nGoethe and Robert Louis Stevenson and many other famous people\nplayed themselves endless stories. If you want to pursue this\nidea further, a list of references below gives you opportunity\nfor all the information you like about marionettes and puppets.\n\n_The Knave of Hearts_ is charming, either as a puppet-play or, as\na class in junior high school gave it recently, a \"legitimate\ndrama.\" The remarks of the manager are all the funnier when\napplied to real characters. The play explains clearly the reasons\nfor the strange behavior of a respectable nursery character. It\nis to be published soon in a book of its own with illustrations\nby Mr. Maxfield Parrish (Scribner's). The author has written\nother plays and stories, some of which you may have seen in _St.\nNicholas_, and also a pleasant operetta, with music by Alice\nTerhune--_The Woodland_ _Princess_, listed in the bibliography\nfollowing. She is also an actress with the New York Comedy Club,\nan excellent amateur organization.\n\nPompdebile's coat of arms, with a heart rampant (i.e., standing\non its hind legs, however that may be accomplished), reminds one\nof the arms suggested for the old clergyman-scholar, Mr.\nCasaubon, in George Eliot's _Middlemarch_--\"three cuttlefish\nsable and a commentator rampant.\"\n\n\n_Lord Dunsany_: FAME AND THE POET\n\nLord Dunsany (Edward Moreton Max Plunkett), the eighteenth baron\nof his name, is the author of a number of stories and plays unique\nin their type of clever imaginativeness. Besides the inimitable\nFive Plays and other dramas listed in the bibliography, his best\nwritings are to be found in _Fifty-One Tales_, which includes \"The\nHen,\" \"Death and Odysseus,\" \"The True Story of the Hare and the\nTortoise,\" and other highly entertaining matters. _Fame and the\nPoet_, originally published in the _Atlantic_, has been recently\nproduced with good effect by the Harvard Dramatic Club. Fame's\nstartling revelation to her faithful worshiper of her real nature\nand attributes is naturally most distressing--even more so,\nperhaps, than the rendezvous which this same goddess appointed\nanother poet, in the _Fifty-One Tales_: \"In the cemetery back of\nthe workhouse, after a hundred years.\"\n\nLord Dunsany was a captain in the First Royal Iniskilling\nFusileers--a regiment mentioned in Sheridan's _Saint Patrick's\nDay_--and saw service in Syria and the Near East as well as on\nthe western front. He was wounded on April 25, 1916, in Flanders.\nSince the war he has visited the United States and seen a\nperformance of his _Tents of the Arabs_ at the Neighborhood\nPlayhouse, New York City.\n\n\n_Beulah Marie Dix_: THE CAPTAIN OF THE GATE\n\nMiss Dix is author of several plays--in addition to those from\n_Allison's Lad_ included in the play-list, of _Across the\nBorder_, and, with the late Evelyn Greenleaf Sutherland, of the\nfrequently acted _Rose of Plymouth Town_. She has also written\nseveral favorite historical stories, including _Merrylips. The\nCaptain of the Gate_ is a tragedy of Cromwell's ruthless\ndevastation of Ireland. The determined and heroic captain\nsurrenders, to face an ignominious death, to keep his word and\nensure delaying the advance of the enemy upon an unprepared\ncountryside, and his courage inspires exhausted and failing men\nto like heroism. This is an effective piece of dramatic\npresentation.\n\n\n_Percy Mackaye_: GETTYSBURG\n\nMr. Percy Mackaye has been most active in the movement for a\ncommunity theatre in the United States and for the revival of\npageantry. He contends rightly that this development might be one\nof the strongest possible influences for true Americanism, and\nhis dramatic work has all been directed toward such a theatre.\nMost notable are his pageants and masques, particularly _Caliban\nby the Yellow Sands_, for the Shakespeare Tercentenary; his play\n_The Scarecrow_, a lively dramatization of Hawthorne's\n_Feathertop_; his opera _Rip van Winkle_, for which Reginald De\nKoven composed music; and _The Canterbury Pilgrims_, in which the\nWife of Bath is the heroine of further robustious adventures. Mr.\nMackaye is also translator, with Professor Tablock, of the\n_Modern Reader's Chaucer_. The little sketch presented here is\ntaken from a volume of _Yankee Fantasies_, in which various\nobservations of past and present New England life are recorded.\nStephen Crane's _The Red Badge of Courage_, a powerful story of\nthe Civil War, is a most excellent help to realizing what the boy\nLige really endured in those days of battle.\n\nMr. Mackaye has adopted here a regularly rhythmic verse without\nthe conventional capital letters at the beginnings of lines\n--perhaps to typify the simple homeliness of the talk.\n\n\n_Harold Brighouse_: LONESOME-LIKE\n\nMr. Brighouse has been best represented in this country by an\nexcellent comedy, _Hobson's Choice_, which was widely played and\nwas printed in the Drama League series of plays (1906). His other\nbest-known work here is the present play, and _The Price of Coal_\n(1909), a picturing of the hard life of miners' wives and their\nSpartan firmness in expectation of fatal accidents. He has\nproduced and published a number of other plays, among them those\nlisted in the bibliography. Mr. Brighouse represents in this\nvolume the work of the English Repertory theatres, which parallel\nthe Abbey Theatre in Dublin, the Glasgow Repertory Theatre, and\nvarious European stage-societies. That at Manchester, with which\nhe has been associated, is directed by Miss Isabel Horniman, has\nseen beautiful stage-settings designed by Mr. Robert Burne-Jones,\nand counts among its dramatists such well-known men as Messrs.\nAllan Monkhouse, author of _Mary Broome_, a sombre and powerful\ntragedy; Stanley Houghton, and Gilbert Cannan. The Liverpool\nTheatre has become even more famous through the dramatic work of\nMr. John Drinkwater. The Little Theatre movement in this country,\nour Drama League, and the various dramatic societies in our\ncolleges and cities are our nearest parallel to these repertory\ntheatres.\n\n_Lonesome-Like_, Mr. Brighouse's most effective short play, is\nwritten in a modified Lancashire dialect, the speech of the\nvillage weavers and spinners. Many of the words are English of\nElizabethan days and earlier, derived mostly from Anglo-Saxon.\n\n_Gradely_ (graithly) means willingly, meekly or decently; _clem_\nmeans starve; _sithee_ is see you or look you; _clogs_ are shoes\nwith wooden soles and leather uppers, and _dungarees_, garments\nof coarse cotton cloth rather like overalls. _A_ is used\nthroughout for _I_.\n\nAs in many English stories, an extreme and painful dread of the\n_workus_, or poorhouse, provides a strong motive force.\n\n\n_John Millington Synge_: RIDERS TO THE SEA\n\nThe work of the Irish Renaissance in the Abbey Theatre in Dublin\nreached its most powerful and tragic height in this tragedy,\nwhich Mr. Yeats compared to the Antigone and (Edipus of\nSophocles). Synge at first wandered about Europe, poetizing; it\nwas Yeats who brought him back to study and embody in genuine\nliterature the poetry of life among his own people. On the bleak\nArran Islands he lived in a fisherman's cottage, and through the\nfloor of his room heard the dialect which he presents in simple\nand poignant beauty in this drama of hopeless struggle. The\n\"second sight\"--called \"the gift\" in _Campbell of Kilmhor_, and\nan incident also in _The Riding to Lithend_--was a sort of\nprophetic vision altogether credited among Celtic peoples, as\namong those of Scott's _Lady of the Lake_. When the mother sees\nthe \"riders to the sea,\"--her drowned son and her living son\nriding together,--she feels convinced that he must soon die. The\nsharp cries of her grief and, above all, the peace of her\nresignation at the end, after all hope is gone, make this, as a\nwriter in the _Manchester Guardian_ is quoted as calling it, \"the\ntragic masterpiece of our language in our time; wherever it has\nbeen in Europe, from Galway to Prague, it has made the word\ntragedy mean something more profoundly stirring and cleansing to\nthe spirit than it did.\"\n\nThe speech of the people is not difficult to understand when you\nmaster a few of its peculiarities. One is the omission of words\nwe generally include, as in, \"Isn't it a hard and cruel man (who)\nwon't hear....\" Another is the common form \"It was crying I was.\"\nA few phrases, like _what way_ for how, _the way_ for so that,\n_in it_ for here or near, and _itself_ for even, or with no\nparticular meaning, as \"Where is he itself?\" The meanings of\nother words will be easily untangled.\n\n\n_William Butler Yeats_: THE LAND OF HEART'S DESIRE\n\nMr. Yeats's best poetic dramas, and particularly this one,\nrepresent beyond question that \"apex of beauty\" to which Lady\nGregory spoke of the Abbey Theatre dramatists as aspiring. This\nplay is not founded on any particular Irish folk-tale. It is\nfilled with the half-dread, half-envy with which the tellers of\nIrish legends seem to regard the fate of mortals bewitched by the\nLeprechaun or Good People. It is rich, too, with the music of\nbeautiful words, without which, Mr. Yeats contends no play can be\n\"of a great kind.\" He says too, \"There is no poem so great that a\nfine speaker cannot make it greater, or that a bad ear cannot\nmake it nothing.\"\n\nMr. Yeats has written broad comedy like Synge's _Shadow of the\nGlen_ and Lady Gregory's _Irish Comedies_; his _Pot of Broth_ is\na most clever retelling of an old, comical tale. But it is by his\nmystical and poetical plays that he would be judged as playwright\nand poet--particularly _Deirdre_, which should be compared with\nSynge's _Deirdre of the Sorrows_; _The Unicorn of the Stars_,\nwritten in collaboration with Lady Gregory; _Cathleen Ni\nHoolihan_, a dramatization of the spirit of Ireland; _The King's\nThreshold_, a high glorification of the poet's art, with a fable,\nbased on an ancient Celtic rite, of the hunger strike; and _The\nLand of Heart's Desire_, most beautifully perfect of all.\n\n\n_Gordon Bottomley_: THE RIDING TO LITHEND\n\n\"_The Riding to Lithend_ is an Icelandic play taken out of the\nnoblest of the Sagas,\" wrote Mr. Lascelles Abercrombie in his\nreview of the published drama in 1909. \"[It] is a fight, one of\nthe greatest fights in legend.... The subject is stirring, and\nMr. Bottomley takes it into a very high region of poetry, giving\nit a purport beyond that of the original teller of the tale....\n[The play] is not a representation of life; it is a symbol of\nlife. In it life is entirely fermented into rhythm, by which we\nmean not only rhythm of words, but rhythm of outline also; the\nbeauty and impressiveness of the play do not depend only on the\nsubject, the diction, and the metre, but on the fact that it has\ndistinct and most evident form, in the musician's sense of the\nword. It is one of those plays that reach the artist's ideal\ncondition of music, in fact.\"\n\nThis is high praise; but who, after studying the play, will doubt\nthat it is deserved? The powerfully moving events of the story\nindeed lead up to the climax in a forthright and exciting manner.\nThe terror of the house-women and the thrall, the fearful love of\nGunnar's mother Rannveig, and the caution of Kolskegg his\nbrother, who \"sailed long ago and far away from us\" in obedience\nto the doom or sentence of the Thing--all these bring out sharply\nthe quite reckless daring of Gunnar himself, who braves the\ndecree. A mysterious and epic touch is added by the three ancient\nhags-evidently of these minor Norns who watch over individual\ndestinies and announce the irrevocable doom of the gods. It was\nHallgerd who broke their thread, representing, of course,\nGunnar's span of life.\n\nThe centre of interest, as well as the spring of the action, is\nclearly Hallgerd, descendant of Sigurd Fafnirsbane and of\nBrynhild--\n\n  ... a hazardous desirable thing,\n  A warm unsounded peril, a flashing mischief,\n  A divine malice, a disquieting voice.\n\nShe, and not any superstitious belief in \"second-sight\" and death\ndecreed, is the cause of Gunnar's remaining outlawed. She\nwrangles about the headdress, not because she particularly wants\nit, but to send her husband on a perilous mission to secure it.\nShe says openly that she has \"set men at him to show forth his\nmight ... planned thefts and breakings of his word\" to stir him\nto battle. Mr. Abercrombie believes that \"She loves her husband\nGunnar, but she refuses to give him any help in his last fight,\nin order that she may see him fight better and fiercer.\" We\nshould, then, have to suppose that her amazing speech at his\ndeath--\n\n  O clear sweet laughter of my heart, flow out!\n  It is so mighty and beautiful and blithe\n  To watch a man dying--to hover and watch--\n\nis not for the blow Gunnar had given her when she \"planned thefts\nand breakings of his word,\" but is rather, as the lines\npowerfully indicate, the exultation of a descendant of the\nValkyrie watching above the battlefields.\n\nReally poetical plays--plays which are both poetic and strongly\ndramatic--are indeed exceedingly rare. Mr. Bottomley is one of\nthe few who have produced such drama in English. For many years\nhe printed his work privately, in beautiful editions for his\nfriends; but of late several of the plays have been made\navailable--_King Lear's Wife in Georgian Poetry_, 1913-15, and in\na volume of the same title, including _Midsummer Eve_ and _The\nRiding to Lithend_, published in London last year.\n\nThose who want more stories of this sort will find them in\n_Thorgils_ and other Icelandic stories modernized by Mr. Hewlett;\nin the _Burnt Njal_, translated by Sir George Dasent, from which\nthis story itself springs; and in the translations by Eirikr\nMagnusson and William Morris, the _Saga Library_--particularly\nthe stories of the Volsungs and Nibelungs, and of Grettir the\nStrong.\n\n\n_louvre_--a smoke-hole in the roof\n\n_thrall_--a captive or serf\n\n_bill_--a battle-ax\n\n_second sight_--prophetic vision, as in _Riders to the Sea_ and\n_Campbell of Kilmhor_\n\n_fetch_--one's double; seeing it is supposed to be a sign that\none is _fey_ or fated to die\n\n_wimpled_--\"clouted up,\" as Hallgerd expresses it, in a headdress\nrather like a nun's. A widow, apparently, might wear her hair\nuncovered\n\n_byre_--cow-barn\n\n_midden_--manure\n\n_quean_--in Middle-English, a jade; in Scotch, a healthy lass;\nthe history of this word and of _queen_, which come from the same\nroot, is strange and interesting\n\n_ambry_--press\n\n_Romeborg_--Rome; _Mickligarth_--Constantinople (Viking names)\n\n_Athcliath_--evidently an Irish port\n\n_mumpers_--beggars\n\n_Markfleet_--a _fleet_ in an inlet of the sea\n\n_mote or gemote_--a formal assembly for making laws\n\n_thing_--assembly for judgment, or parliament; this is an early\nIcelandic meaning of the word _thing_\n\n\n\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY OF PLAYS FOR READING IN HIGH SCHOOLS\n\n\n+Thomas Bailey Aldrich+\n\nMERCEDES: A tragic story of the inextinguishable hatreds and\nreprisals of the French invasion of Spain in 1810, and of a\nwoman's terrible heroism.\n\nIn _Collected Works_, Houghton Mifflin.\n\nPAULINE PAVLOVNA: Cleverly executed, slight plot in dialogue,\nwherein the character of the hero is sharply revealed;\nreminiscent of Browning's _In a Balcony_, though with a quite\ndifferent scheme.\n\n_Ibid._\n\n\n+Mary Austin+\n\nTHE ARROW-MAKER: The tragedy of a noble medicine-woman of a tribe\nof California Indians, and of a weak and selfish chief.\n\nDuffield.\n\n\n+Granville Barker+\n\nRococo: In which we discover a clergyman and his relatives in\nphysical altercation over a rococo vase, and follow their dispute\nto a determinative conclusion.\n\nSidgwick and Jackson, London.\n\nVOTE BY BALLOT: A drama of English elections and the forces\ninvolved.\n\nSidgwick and Jackson.\n\nTHE VOYSEY INHERITANCE: The inheritance is a dishonored name and\na dishonest business.\n\nIn _Three Plays_, Sidgwick and Jackson.\n\n\n+Granville Barker and Dion Calthorpe+\n\nHARLEQUINADE: Its development from the days of Persephone, Momus,\nand Charon is displayed and explained by Alice and her uncle.\n\nSidgwick and Jackson.\n\n\n+James Barrie+\n\nTHE ADMIRABLE CRICHTON: In the struggle for existence on a desert\nisland, the family butler provides the brains and safety for an\nEnglish family; the party is then rescued, and returns to the\nimpeccable conventions of London.\n\nScribner's, New York; Hodder and Stoughton, London.\n\nALICE SIT-BY-THE FIRE: A mother with keen insight and a\ndelightful sense of humor has to deal with a serious attack of\nromantic imagination in her very young daughter, who feels\nresponsible for the conduct of the family.\n\nScribner's; Hodder and Stoughton.\n\nTHE OLD LADY SHOWS HER MEDALS: Mrs. Dowie, a charwoman who has\nresorted to desperate remedies in order to have some part in the\nwar, goes through an agonizing crisis of exposure, into real joy\nand sharp sorrow.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
