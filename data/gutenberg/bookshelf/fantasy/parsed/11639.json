Most of the matter strictly appropriate to a Preface you\nmay find, if you so elect, in the Foreword addressed to Sinclair Lewis.\nAnd, in fact, after writing two prefaces to this \"Figures of\nEarth\"--first, in this epistle to Lewis, and, secondly, in the remarks[1]\naffixed to the illustrated edition,--I had thought this volume could\nvery well continue to survive as long as its deficiencies permit,\nwithout the confection of a third preface, until I began a little more\ncarefully to consider this romance, in the seventh year of its\nexistence.\n\n[Footnote 1: Omitted in this edition since it was not possible to include\nall of Frank C. Pap\u00e9's magnificent illustrations.--THE PUBLISHER]\n\nBut now, now, the deficiency which I note in chief (like the superior\nofficer of a disastrously wrecked crew) lies in the fact that what I had\nmeant to be the main \"point\" of \"Figures of Earth,\" while explicitly\nenough stated in the book, remains for every practical end\nindiscernible.... For I have written many books during the last quarter\nof a century. Yet this is the only one of them which began at one\nplainly recognizable instant with one plainly recognizable imagining. It\nis the only book by me which ever, virtually, came into being, with its\ngoal set, and with its theme and its contents more or less\npre-determined throughout, between two ticks of the clock.\n\nEgotism here becomes rather unavoidable. At Dumbarton Grange the library\nin which I wrote for some twelve years was lighted by three windows set\nside by side and opening outward. It was in the instant of unclosing one\nof these windows, on a fine afternoon in the spring of 1919, to speak\nwith a woman and a child who were then returning to the house (with the\nday's batch of mail from the post office), that, for no reason at all, I\nreflected it would be, upon every personal ground, regrettable if, as\nthe moving window unclosed, that especial woman and that particular\nchild proved to be figures in the glass, and the window opened upon\nnothingness. For that, I believed, was about to happen. There would be,\nI knew, revealed beyond that moving window, when it had opened all the\nway, not absolute darkness, but a gray nothingness, rather sweetly\nscented.... Well! there was not. I once more enjoyed the quite familiar\nexperience of being mistaken. It is gratifying to record that nothing\nwhatever came of that panic surmise, of that second-long nightmare--of\nthat brief but over-tropical flowering, for all I know, of\nindigestion,--save, ultimately, the 80,000 words or so of this book.\n\nFor I was already planning, vaguely, to begin on, later in that year,\n\"the book about Manuel.\" And now I had the germ of it,--in the instant\nwhen Dom Manuel opens the over-familiar window, in his own home, to see\nhis wife and child, his lands, and all the Poictesme of which he was at\nonce the master and the main glory, presented as bright, shallow, very\nfondly loved illusions in the protective glass of Ageus. I knew that the\nfantastic thing which had not happened to me,--nor, I hope, to\nanybody,--was precisely the thing, and the most important thing, which\nhad happened to the gray Count of Poictesme.\n\nSo I made that evening a memorandum of that historical circumstance; and\nfor some months this book existed only in the form of that memorandum.\nThen, through, as it were, this wholly isolated window, I began to grope\nat \"the book about Manuel,\"--of whom I had hitherto learned only, from\nmy other romances, who were his children, and who had been the sole\nwitness of Dom Manuel's death, inasmuch as I had read about that also,\nwith some interest, in the fourth chapter of \"Jurgen\"; and from the\nunclosing of this window I developed \"Figures of Earth,\" for the most\npart toward, necessarily, anterior events. For it seemed to me--as it\nstill seems,--that the opening of this particular magic casement, upon\nan outlook rather more perilous than the bright foam of fairy seas, was\nalike the climax and the main \"point\" of my book.\n\nYet this fact, I am resignedly sure, as I nowadays appraise this\nseven-year-old romance, could not ever be detected by any reader of\n\"Figures of Earth,\" In consequence, it has seemed well here to confess\nat some length the original conception of this volume, without at all\ngoing into the value of that conception, nor into, heaven knows, how\nthis conception came so successfully to be obscured.\n\n\nSo I began \"the book about Manuel\" that summer,--in 1919, upon the back\nporch of our cottage at the Rockbridge Alum Springs, whence, as I recall\nit, one could always, just as Manuel did upon Upper Morven, regard the\nchanging green and purple of the mountains and the tall clouds trailing\nnorthward, and could observe that the things one viewed were all\ngigantic and lovely and seemed not to be very greatly bothering about\nhumankind. I suppose, though, that, in point of fact, it occasionally\nrained. In any case, upon that same porch, as it happened, this book was\nfinished in the summer of 1920.\n\nAnd the notes made at this time as to \"Figures of Earth\" show much that\nnowadays is wholly incomprehensible. There was once an Olrun in the\nbook; and I can recall clearly enough how her part in the story was\nabsorbed by two of the other characters,--by Suskind and by Alianora.\nFreydis, it appears, was originally called Hlif. Miramon at one stage of\nthe book's being, I find with real surprise, was married _en secondes\nnoces_ to Math. Othmar has lost that prominence which once was his. And\nit seems, too, there once figured in Manuel's heart affairs a\nBel-Imperia, who, so near as I can deduce from my notes, was a lady in a\ntapestry. Someone unstitched her, to, I imagine, her destruction,\nalthough I suspect that a few skeins of this quite forgotten Bel-Imperia\nendure in the Radegonde of another tale.\n\nNor can I make anything whatever of my notes about Guivret (who seems to\nhave been in no way connected with Guivric the Sage), nor about Biduz,\nnor about the Anti-Pope,--even though, to be sure, one mention of this\nheresiarch yet survives in the present book. I am wholly baffled to\nread, in my own penciling, such proposed chapter headings as \"The\nJealousy of Niafer\" and \"How Sclaug Loosed the Dead,\"--which latter is\nwith added incomprehensibility annotated \"(?Phorgemon).\" And \"The Spirit\nWho Had Half of Everything\" seems to have been exorcised pretty\nthoroughly.... No; I find the most of my old notes as to this book\nmerely bewildering; and I find, too, something of pathos in these\nembryons of unborn dreams which, for one cause or another, were\nobliterated and have been utterly forgotten by their creator, very much\nas in this book vexed Miramon Lluagor twists off the head of a not quite\nsatisfactory, whimpering design, and drops the valueless fragments into\nhis waste-basket.... But I do know that the entire book developed,\nhowsoever helterskelter, and after fumbling in no matter how many blind\nalleys, from that first memorandum about the troubling window of Ageus.\nAll leads toward--and through--that window.\n\n\nThe book, then, was published in the February of 1921. I need not here\ndeal with its semi-serial appearance in the guise of short stories:\nthese details are recorded elsewhere. But I confess with appropriate\nhumility that the reception of \"Figures of Earth\" by the public was, as\nI have written in another place, a depressing business. This romance, at\nthat time, through one extraneous reason and another, disappointed\nwell-nigh everybody, for all that it has since become, so near as I can\njudge, the best liked of my books, especially among women. It seems,\nindeed, a fact sufficiently edifying that, in appraising the two\nlegendary heroes of Poictesme, the sex of whom Jurgen esteemed himself a\nconnoisseur, should, almost unanimously, prefer Manuel.\n\nFor the rest,--since, as you may remember, this is the third preface\nwhich I have written for this book,--I can but repeat more or less what\nI have conceded elsewhere. This \"Figures of Earth\" appeared immediately\nfollowing, and during the temporary sequestration of, \"Jurgen.\" The fact\nwas forthwith, quite unreticently, discovered that in \"Figures of Earth\"\nI had not succeeded in my attempt to rewrite its predecessor: and this\ncrass failure, so open, so flagrant, and so undeniable, caused what I\ncan only describe as the instant and overwhelming and universal triumph\nof \"Figures of Earth\" to be precisely what did not occur. In 1921\nComstockery still surged, of course, in full cry against the imprisoned\npawnbroker and the crimes of his author, both literary and personal; and\nthe, after all, tolerably large portion of the reading public who were\nnot disgusted by Jurgen's lechery were now, so near as I could gather,\nenraged by Manuel's lack of it.\n\nIt followed that--among the futile persons who use serious, long words\nin talking about mere books,--aggrieved reproof of my auctorial\nmalversations, upon the one ground or the other, became in 1921\nbiloquial and pandemic. Not many other volumes, I believe, have been\nburlesqued and cried down in the public prints by their own\ndedicatees.... But from the cicatrix of that healed wound I turn away. I\npreserve a forgiving silence, comparable to that of Hermione in the\nfifth act of \"A Winter's Tale\": I resolve that whenever I mention the\nnames of Louis Untermeyer and H.L. Mencken it shall be in some\nconnection more pleasant, and that here I will not mention them at all.\n\nMeanwhile the fifteen or so experiments in contrapuntal prose were, in\nparticular, uncharted passages from which I stayed unique in deriving\npleasure where others found bewilderment and no tongue-tied irritation:\nbut, in general, and above every misdemeanor else, the book exasperated\neverybody by not being a more successfully managed re-hashing of the\nthen notorious \"Jurgen.\"\n\nSince 1921, and since the rehabilitation of \"Jurgen,\" the notion has\nuprisen, gradually, among the more bold and speculative thinkers, that\nperhaps I was not, after all, in this \"Figures of Earth\" attempting to\nrewrite \"Jurgen\": and Manuel has made his own friend.\n\nJames Branch Cabell\n\nRichmond-in-Virginia\n\n30 April 1927\n\n\n\n\nA FOREWORD\n\n\"Amoto quoeramus seria ludo\"\n\n\n\nTo\n\nSINCLAIR LEWIS\n\n\n\nMY DEAR LEWIS:\n\n\nTo you (whom I take to be as familiar with the Manuelian cycle of\nromance as is any person now alive) it has for some while appeared, I\nknow, a not uncurious circumstance that in the _Key to the Popular Tales\nof Poictesme_ there should have been included so little directly\nrelative to Manuel himself. No reader of the _Popular Tales_ (as I\nrecall your saying at the Alum when we talked over, among so many other\nmatters, this monumental book) can fail to note that always Dom Manuel\nlooms obscurely in the background, somewhat as do King Arthur and\nwhite-bearded Charlemagne in their several cycles, dispensing justice\nand bestowing rewards, and generally arranging the future, for the\nsurvivors of the outcome of stories which more intimately concern\nthemselves with Anavalt and Coth and Holden, and with Kerin and Ninzian\nand Gonfal and Donander, and with Miramon (in his r\u00f4le of Manuel's\nseneschal), or even with Sclaug and Thragnar, than with the liege-lord\nof Poictesme. Except in the old sixteenth-century chapbook (unknown to\nyou, I believe, and never reprinted since 1822, and not ever modernized\ninto any cognizable spelling), there seems to have been nowhere an\nEnglish rendering of the legends in which Dom Manuel is really the main\nfigure.\n\nWell, this book attempts to supply that desideratum, and is, so far as\nthe writer is aware, the one fairly complete epitome in modern English\nof the Manuelian historiography not included by Lewistam which has yet\nbeen prepared.\n\nIt is obvious, of course, that in a single volume of this bulk there\ncould not be included more than a selection from the great body of myths\nwhich, we may assume, have accumulated gradually round the mighty though\nshadowy figure of Manuel the Redeemer. Instead, my aim has been to make\nchoice of such stories and traditions as seemed most fit to be cast into\nthe shape of a connected narrative and regular sequence of events; to\nlend to all that wholesome, edifying and optimistic tone which in\nreading-matter is so generally preferable to mere intelligence; and\nmeanwhile to preserve as much of the quaint style of the gestes as is\nconsistent with clearness. Then, too, in the original mediaeval\nromances, both in their prose and metrical form, there are occasional\nallusions to natural processes which make these stories unfit to be\nplaced in the hands of American readers, who, as a body, attest their\nrespectability by insisting that their parents were guilty of\nunmentionable conduct; and such passages of course necessitate\nconsiderable editing.\n\n\nII\n\n\nNo schoolboy (and far less the scholastic chronicler of those last final\nupshots for whose furtherance \"Hannibal invaded Rome and Erasmus wrote\nin Oxford cloisters\") needs nowadays to be told that the Manuel of these\nlegends is to all intents a fictitious person. That in the earlier half\nof the thirteenth century there was ruling over the Poictoumois a\npowerful chieftain named Manuel, nobody has of late disputed seriously.\nBut the events of the actual human existence of this Lord of\nPoictesme--very much as the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa has been\nidentified with the wood-demon Barbatos, and the prophet Elijah, \"caught\nup into the chariot of the Vedic Vayu,\" has become one with the Slavonic\nPerun,--have been inextricably blended with the legends of the Dirghic\nManu-Elul, Lord of August.\n\nThus, even the irregularity in Manuel's eyes is taken by Vanderhoffen,\nin his _Tudor Tales_, to be a myth connecting Manuel with the Vedic\nRudra and the Russian Magarko and the Servian Vii,--\"and every\nbeneficent storm-god represented with his eye perpetually winking (like\nsheet lightning), lest his concentrated look (the thunderbolt) should\nreduce the universe to ashes.... His watery parentage, and the\nstorm-god's relationship with a swan-maiden of the Apsarasas (typifying\nthe mists and clouds), and with Freydis the fire queen, are equally\nobvious: whereas Niafer is plainly a variant of Nephthys, Lady of the\nHouse, whose personality Dr. Budge sums up as 'the goddess of the death\nwhich is not eternal,' or Nerthus, the Subterranean Earth, which the\nwarm rainstorm quickens to life and fertility.\"\n\nAll this seems dull enough to be plausible. Yet no less an authority\nthan Charles Garnier has replied, in rather indignant rebuttal: \"Qu'ont\n\u00e9t\u00e8 en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 Manuel et Siegfried, Achille et Rustem? Par quels\nexploits ont-ils m\u00e9rit\u00e9 l'\u00e9ternelle admiration que leur ont vou\u00e9e les\nhommes de leur race? Nul ne r\u00e9pondra jamais \u00e0 ces questions.... Mais\nPoictesme croit \u00e0 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de cette figure que ses romans ont faite si\nbelle, car le pays n'a pas d'autre histoire. Cette figure du Comte\nManuel est r\u00e9elle d'ailleurs, car elle est l'image purifi\u00e9e de la race\nqui l'a produite, et, si on peut s'exprimer ainsi, l'incarnation de son\ng\u00e9nie.\"\n\n--Which is quite just, and, when you come to think it over, proves Dom\nManuel to be nowadays, for practical purposes, at least as real as Dr.\nPaul Vanderhoffen.\n\n\nIII\n\n\nBetween the two main epic cycles of Poictesme, as embodied in _Les\nGestes de Manuel_ and _La Haulte Histoire de Jurgen_, more or less\ncomparison is inevitable. And Codman, I believe, has put the gist of the\nmatter succinctly enough.\n\nSays Codman: \"The Gestes are mundane stories, the History is a cosmic\naffair, in that, where Manuel faces the world, Jurgen considers the\nuniverse.... Dom Manuel is the Achilles of Poictesme, as Jurgen is its\nUlysses.\"\n\nAnd, roughly, the distinction serves. Yet minute consideration\ndiscovers, I think, in these two sets of legends a more profound, if\nsubtler, difference, in the handling of the protagonist: with Jurgen all\nof the physical and mental man is rendered as a matter of course;\nwhereas in dealing with Manuel there is, always, I believe, a certain\nperceptible and strange, if not inexplicable, aloofness. Manuel did thus\nand thus, Manuel said so and so, these legends recount: yes, but never\nanywhere have I detected any firm assertion as to Manuel's thoughts and\nemotions, nor any peep into the workings of this hero's mind. He is\n\"done\" from the outside, always at arm's length. It is not merely that\nManuel's nature is tinctured with the cool unhumanness of his father the\nwater-demon: rather, these old poets of Poictesme would seem, whether of\nintention or no, to have dealt with their national hero as a person,\nhowsoever admirable in many of his exploits, whom they have never been\nable altogether to love, or entirely to sympathize with, or to view\nquite without distrust.\n\nThere are several ways of accounting for this fact,--ranging from the\nhurtful as well as beneficent aspect of the storm-god, to the natural\ninability of a poet to understand a man who succeeds in everything: but\nthe fact is, after all, of no present importance save that it may well\nhave prompted Lewistam to scamp his dealings with this always somewhat\nambiguous Manuel, and so to omit the hereinafter included legends, as\nunsuited to the clearer and sunnier atmosphere of the _Popular Tales_.\n\nFor my part, I am quite content, in this Comedy of Appearances, to\nfollow the old romancers' lead. \"Such and such things were said and done\nby our great Manuel,\" they say to us, in effect: \"such and such were the\nappearances, and do you make what you can of them.\"\n\nI say that, too, with the addition that in real life, also, such is the\nfashion in which we are compelled to deal with all happenings and with\nall our fellows, whether they wear or lack the gaudy name of heroism.\n\n\nDumbarton Grange\n\nOctober, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nPART ONE\n\n\nTHE BOOK OF CREDIT\n\n\nTO\n\nWILSON FOLLETT\n\n\n\nThen _answered the Magician dredefully: Manuel, Manuel, now I shall\nshewe unto thee many bokes of_ Nygromancy, _and howe thou shalt cum by\nit lyghtly and knowe the practyse therein. And, moreouer, I shall shewe\nand informe you so that thou shall have thy Desyre, whereby my thynke it\nis a great Gyfte for so lytyll a doynge_.\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nHow Manuel Left the Mire\n\n\nThey of Poictesme narrate that in the old days when miracles were as\ncommon as fruit pies, young Manuel was a swineherd, living modestly in\nattendance upon the miller's pigs. They tell also that Manuel was\ncontent enough: he knew not of the fate which was reserved for him.\n\nMeanwhile in all the environs of Rathgor, and in the thatched villages\nof Lower Targamon, he was well liked: and when the young people gathered\nin the evening to drink brandy and eat nuts and gingerbread, nobody\ndanced more merrily than Squinting Manuel. He had a quiet way with the\ngirls, and with the men a way of solemn, blinking simplicity which\ncaused the more hasty in judgment to consider him a fool. Then, too,\nyoung Manuel was very often detected smiling sleepily over nothing, and\nhis gravest care in life appeared to be that figure which Manuel had\nmade out of marsh clay from the pool of Haranton.\n\nThis figure he was continually reshaping and realtering. The figure\nstood upon the margin of the pool; and near by were two stones overgrown\nwith moss, and supporting a cross of old worm-eaten wood, which\ncommemorated what had been done there.\n\nOne day, toward autumn, as Manuel was sitting in this place, and looking\ninto the deep still water, a stranger came, and he wore a fierce long\nsword that interfered deplorably with his walking.\n\n\"Now I wonder what it is you find in that dark pool to keep you staring\nso?\" the stranger asked, first of all.\n\n\"I do not very certainly know,\" replied Manuel \"but mistily I seem to\nsee drowned there the loves and the desires and the adventures I had\nwhen I wore another body than this. For the water of Haranton, I must\ntell you, is not like the water of other fountains, and curious dreams\nengender in this pool.\"\n\n\"I speak no ill against oneirologya, although broad noon is hardly the\nbest time for its practise,\" declared the snub-nosed stranger. \"But what\nis that thing?\" he asked, pointing.\n\n\"It is the figure of a man, which I have modeled and re-modeled, sir,\nbut cannot seem to get exactly to my liking. So it is necessary that I\nkeep laboring at it until the figure is to my thinking and my desire.\"\n\n\"But, Manuel, what need is there for you to model it at all?\"\n\n\"Because my mother, sir, was always very anxious for me to make a figure\nin the world, and when she lay a-dying I promised her that I would do\nso, and then she put a geas upon me to do it.\"\n\n\"Ah, to be sure! but are you certain it was this kind of figure she\nmeant?\"\n\n\"Yes, for I have often heard her say that, when I grew up, she wanted me\nto make myself a splendid and admirable young man in every respect. So\nit is necessary that I make the figure of a young man, for my mother was\nnot of these parts, but a woman of Ath Cliath, and so she put a geas\nupon me--\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, you had mentioned this geas, and I am wondering what sort of\na something is this geas.\"\n\n\"It is what you might call a bond or an obligation, sir, only it is of\nthe particularly strong and unreasonable and affirmative and secret sort\nwhich the Virbolg use.\"\n\nThe stranger now looked from the figure to Manuel, and the stranger\ndeliberated the question (which later was to puzzle so many people) if\nany human being could be as simple as Manuel appeared. Manuel at twenty\nwas not yet the burly giant he became. But already he was a gigantic and\nflorid person, so tall that the heads of few men reached to his\nshoulder; a person of handsome exterior, high featured and blond, having\na narrow small head, and vivid light blue eyes, and the chest of a\nstallion; a person whose left eyebrow had an odd oblique droop, so that\nthe stupendous boy at his simplest appeared to be winking the\ninformation that he was in jest.\n\nAll in all, the stranger found this young swineherd ambiguous; and there\nwas another curious thing too which the stranger noticed about Manuel.\n\n\"Is it on account of this geas,\" asked the stranger, \"that a great lock\nhas been sheared away from your yellow hair?\"\n\nIn an instant Manuel's face became dark and wary. \"No,\" he said, \"that\nhas nothing to do with my geas, and we must not talk about that\"\n\n\"Now you are a queer lad to be having such an obligation upon your head,\nand to be having well-nigh half the hair cut away from your head, and to\nbe having inside your head such notions. And while small harm has ever\ncome from humoring one's mother, yet I wonder at you, Manuel, that you\nshould sit here sleeping in the sunlight among your pigs, and be giving\nyour young time to improbable sculpture and stagnant water, when there\nis such a fine adventure awaiting you, and when the Norns are\nforetelling such high things about you as they spin the thread of your\nliving.\"\n\n\"Hah, glory be to God, friend, but what is this adventure?\"\n\n\"The adventure is that the Count of Arnaye's daughter yonder has been\ncarried off by a magician, and that the high Count Demetrios offers much\nwealth and broad lands, and his daughter's hand in marriage, too, to the\nlad that will fetch back this lovely girl.\"\n\n\"I have heard talk of this in the kitchen of Arnaye, where I sometimes\nsell them a pig. But what are such matters to a swineherd?\"\n\n\"My lad, you are to-day a swineherd drowsing in the sun, as yesterday\nyou were a baby squalling in the cradle, but to-morrow you will be\nneither of these if there by any truth whatever in the talking of the\nNorns as they gossip at the foot of their ash-tree beside the door of\nthe Sylan's House.\"\n\nManuel appeared to accept the inevitable. He bowed his brightly colored\nhigh head, saying gravely: \"All honor be to Urdhr and Verdandi and\nSkuld! If I am decreed to be the champion that is to rescue the Count of\nArnaye's daughter, it is ill arguing with the Norns. Come, tell me now,\nhow do you call this doomed magician, and how does one get to him to\nsever his wicked head from his foul body?\"\n\n\"Men speak of him as Miramon Lluagor, lord of the nine kinds of sleep\nand prince of the seven madnesses. He lives in mythic splendor at the\ntop of the gray mountain called Vraidex, where he contrives all manner\nof illusions, and, in particular, designs the dreams of men.\"\n\n\"Yes, in the kitchen of Arnaye, also, such was the report concerning\nthis Miramon: and not a person in the kitchen denied that this Miramon\nis an ugly customer.\"\n\n\"He is the most subtle of magicians. None can withstand him, and nobody\ncan pass the terrible serpentine designs which Miramon has set to guard\nthe gray scarps of Vraidex, unless one carries the more terrible sword\nFlamberge, which I have here in its blue scabbard.\"\n\n\"Why, then, it is you who must rescue the Count's daughter.\"\n\n\"No, that would not do at all: for there is in the life of a champion\ntoo much of turmoil and of buffetings and murderings to suit me, who am\na peace-loving person. Besides, to the champion who rescues the Lady\nGis\u00e8le will be given her hand in marriage, and as I have a wife, I know\nthat to have two wives would lead to twice too much dissension to suit\nme, who am a peace-loving person. So I think it is you who had better\ntake the sword and the adventure.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Manuel said, \"much wealth and broad lands and a lovely wife are\nfiner things to ward than a parcel of pigs.\"\n\nSo Manuel girded on the charmed scabbard, and with the charmed sword he\nsadly demolished the clay figure he could not get quite right. Then\nManuel sheathed Flamberge, and Manuel cried farewell to the pigs.\n\n\"I shall not ever return to you, my pigs, because, at worst, to die\nvalorously is better than to sleep out one's youth in the sun. A man has\nbut one life. It is his all. Therefore I now depart from you, my pigs,\nto win me a fine wife and much wealth and leisure wherein to discharge\nmy geas. And when my geas is lifted I shall not come back to you, my\npigs, but I shall travel everywhither, and into the last limits of\nearth, so that I may see the ends of this world and may judge them while\nmy life endures. For after that, they say, I judge not, but am judged:\nand a man whose life has gone out of him, my pigs, is not even good\nbacon.\"\n\n\"So much rhetoric for the pigs,\" says the stranger, \"is well enough, and\nlikely to please them. But come, is there not some girl or another to\nwhom you should be saying good-bye with other things than words?\"\n\n\"No, at first I thought I would also bid farewell to Suskind, who is\nsometimes friendly with me in the twilight wood, but upon reflection it\nseems better not to. For Suskind would probably weep, and exact promises\nof eternal fidelity, and otherwise dampen the ardor with which I look\ntoward to-morrow and the winning of the wealthy Count of Arnaye's lovely\ndaughter.\"\n\n\"Now, to be sure, you are a queer cool candid fellow, you young Manuel,\nwho will go far, whether for good or evil!\"\n\n\"I do not know about good or evil. But I am Manuel, and I shall follow\nafter my own thinking and my own desires.\"\n\n\"And certainly it is no less queer you should be saying that: for, as\neverybody knows, that used to be the favorite byword of your namesake\nthe famous Count Manuel who is so newly dead in Poictesme yonder.\"\n\nAt that the young swineherd nodded, gravely. \"I must accept the omen,\nsir. For, as I interpret it, my great namesake has courteously made way\nfor me, in order that I may go far beyond him.\"\n\nThen Manuel cried farewell and thanks to the mild-mannered, snub-nosed\nstranger, and Manuel left the miller's pigs to their own devices by the\npool of Haranton, and Manuel marched away in his rags to meet a fate\nthat was long talked about.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nNiafer\n\n\nThe first thing of all that Manuel did, was to fill a knapsack with\nsimple and nutritious food, and then he went to the gray mountain called\nVraidex, upon the remote and cloud-wrapped summit of which dread Miramon\nLluagor dwelt, in a doubtful palace wherein the lord of the nine sleeps\ncontrived illusions and designed the dreams of men. When Manuel had\npassed under some very old maple-trees, and was beginning the ascent, he\nfound a smallish, flat-faced, dark-haired boy going up before him.\n\n\"Hail, snip,\" says Manuel, \"and whatever are you doing in this perilous\nplace?\"\n\n\"Why, I am going,\" the dark-haired boy replied, \"to find out how the\nLady Gis\u00e8le d'Arnaye is faring on the tall top of this mountain.\"\n\n\"Oho, then we will undertake this adventure together, for that is my\nerrand too. And when the adventure is fulfilled, we will fight together,\nand the survivor will have the wealth and broad lands and the Count's\ndaughter to sit on his knee. What do they call you, friend?\"\n\n\"I am called Niafer. But I believe that the Lady Gis\u00e8le is already\nmarried, to Miramon Lluagor. At least, I sincerely hope she is married\nto this great magician, for otherwise it would not be respectable for\nher to be living with him at the top of this gray mountain.\"\n\n\"Fluff and puff! what does that matter?\" says Manuel. \"There is no law\nagainst a widow's remarrying forthwith: and widows are quickly made by\nany champion about whom the wise Norns are already talking. But I must\nnot tell you about that, Niafer, because I do not wish to appear\nboastful. So I must simply say to you, Niafer, that I am called Manuel,\nand have no other title as yet, being not yet even a baron.\"\n\n\"Come now,\" says Niafer, \"but you are rather sure of yourself for a\nyoung boy!\"\n\n\"Why, of what may I be sure in this shifting world if not of myself?\"\n\n\"Our elders, Manuel, declare that such self-conceit is a fault, and our\nelders, they say, are wiser than we.\"\n\n\"Our elders, Niafer, have long had the management of this world's\naffairs, and you can see for yourself what they have made of these\naffairs. What sort of a world is it, I ask you, in which time peculates\nthe gold from hair and the crimson from all lips, and the north wind\ncarries away the glow and glory and contentment of October, and a\ndriveling old magician steals a lovely girl? Why, such maraudings are\nout of reason, and show plainly that our elders have no notion how to\nmanage things.\"\n\n\"Eh, Manuel, and will you re-model the world?\"\n\n\"Who knows?\" says Manuel, in the high pride of his youth. \"At all\nevents, I do not mean to leave it unaltered.\"\n\nThen Niafer, a more prosaic person, gave him a long look compounded\nequally of admiration and pity, but Niafer did not dispute the matter.\nInstead, these two pledged constant fealty until they should have\nrescued Madame Gis\u00e8le.\n\n\"Then we will fight for her,\" says Manuel, again.\n\n\"First, Manuel, let me see her face, and then let me see her state of\nmind, and afterward I will see about fighting you. Meanwhile, this is a\nvery tall mountain, and the climbing of it will require all the breath\nwhich we are wasting here.\"\n\nSo the two began the ascent of Vraidex, by the winding road upon which\nthe dreams traveled when they were sent down to men by the lord of the\nseven madnesses. All gray rock was the way at first. But they soon\nreached the gnawed bones of those who had ascended before them,\nscattered about a small plain that was overgrown with ironweed: and\nthrough and over the tall purple blossoms came to destroy the boys the\nSerpent of the East, a very dreadful design with which Miramon afflicted\nthe sleep of Lithuanians and Tartars. The snake rode on a black horse, a\nblack falcon perched on his head, and a black hound followed him. The\nhorse stumbled, the falcon clamored, the hound howled.\n\nThen said the snake: \"My steed, why do you stumble? my hound, why do you\nhowl? and, my falcon, why do you clamor? For these three doings foresay\nsome ill to me.\"\n\n\"Oh, a great ill!\" replies Manuel, with his charmed sword already half\nout of the scabbard.\n\nBut Niafer cried: \"An endless ill is foresaid by these doings. For I\nhave been to the Island of the Oaks: and under the twelfth oak was a\ncopper casket, and in the casket was a purple duck, and in the duck was\nan egg: and in the egg, O Norka, was and is your death.\"\n\n\"It is true that my death is in such an egg,\" said the Serpent of the\nEast, \"but nobody will ever find that egg, and therefore I am resistless\nand immortal.\"\n\n\"To the contrary, the egg, as you can perceive, is in my hand; and when\nI break this egg you will die, and it is smaller worms than you that\nwill be thanking me for their supper this night.\"\n\nThe serpent looked at the poised egg, and he trembled and writhed so\nthat his black scales scattered everywhither scintillations of reflected\nsunlight. He cried, \"Give me the egg, and I will permit you two to\nascend unmolested, to a more terrible destruction.\"\n\nNiafer was not eager to do this, but Manuel thought it best, and so at\nlast Niafer consented to the bargain, for the sake of the serpent's\nchildren. Then the two lads went upward, while the serpent bandaged the\neyes of his horse and of his hound, and hooded his falcon, and crept\ngingerly away to hide the egg in an unmentionable place.\n\n\"But how in the devil,\" says Manuel, \"did you manage to come by that\ninvaluable egg?\"\n\n\"It is a quite ordinary duck egg, Manuel. But the Serpent of the East\nhas no way of discovering the fact unless he breaks the egg: and that is\nthe one thing the serpent will never do, because he thinks it is the\nmagic egg which contains his death.\"\n\n\"Come, Niafer, you are not handsome to look at, but you are far cleverer\nthan I thought you!\"\n\nNow, as Manuel clapped Niafer on the shoulder, the forest beside the\nroadway was agitated, and the underbrush crackled, and the tall\nbeech-trees crashed and snapped and tumbled helter-skelter. The crust of\nthe earth was thus broken through by the Serpent of the North. Only the\nhead and throat of this design of Miramon's was lifted from the jumbled\ntrees, for it was requisite of course that the serpent's lower coils\nshould never loose their grip upon the foundations of Norroway. All of\nthe design that showed was overgrown with seaweed and barnacles.\n\n\"It is the will of Miramon Lluagor that I forthwith demolish you both,\"\nsays this serpent, yawning with a mouth like a fanged cave.\n\nOnce more young Manuel had reached for his charmed sword Flamberge, but\nit was Niafer who spoke.\n\n\"No, for before you can destroy me,\" says Niafer, \"I shall have cast\nthis bridle over your head.\"\n\n\"What sort of bridle is that?\" inquired the great snake scornfully.\n\n\"And are those goggling flaming eyes not big enough and bright enough to\nsee that this is the soft bridle called Gleipnir, which is made of the\nbreath of fish and of the spittle of birds and of the footfall of a\ncat?\"\n\n\"Now, although certainly such a bridle was foretold,\" the snake\nconceded, a little uneasily, \"how can I make sure that you speak the\ntruth when you say this particular bridle is Gleipnir?\"\n\n\"Why, in this way: I will cast the bridle over your head, and then you\nwill see for yourself that the old prophecy will be fulfilled, and that\nall power and all life will go out of you, and that the Northmen will\ndream no more.\"\n\n\"No, do you keep that thing away from me, you little fool! No, no: we\nwill not test your truthfulness in that way. Instead, do you two\ncontinue your ascent, to a more terrible destruction, and to face\nbarbaric dooms coming from the West. And do you give me the bridle to\ndemolish in place of you. And then, if I live forever I shall know that\nthis is indeed Gleipnir, and that you have spoken the truth.\"\n\nSo Niafer consented to this testing of his veracity, rather than permit\nthis snake to die, and the foundations of Norroway (in which kingdom,\nNiafer confessed, he had an aunt then living) thus to be dissolved by\nthe loosening of the dying serpent's grip upon Middlegarth. The bridle\nwas yielded, and Niafer and Manuel went upward.\n\nManuel asked, \"Snip, was that in truth the bridle called Gleipnir?\"\n\n\"No, Manuel, it is an ordinary bridle. But this Serpent of the North has\nno way of discovering this fact except by fitting the bridle over his\nhead: and this one thing the serpent will never do, because he knows\nthat then, if my bridle proved to be Gleipnir, all power and all life\nwould go out of him.\"\n\n\"O subtle, ugly little snip!\" says Manuel: and again he patted Niafer on\nthe shoulder. Then Manuel spoke very highly in praise of cleverness, and\nsaid that, for one, he had never objected to it in its place.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nAscent of Vraidex\n\n\nNow it was evening, and the two sought shelter in a queer windmill by\nthe roadside, finding there a small wrinkled old man in a patched coat.\nHe gave them lodgings for the night, and honest bread and cheese, but\nfor his own supper he took frogs out of his bosom, and roasted these in\nthe coals.\n\nThen the two boys sat in the doorway, and watched that night's dreams\ngoing down from Vraidex to their allotted work in the world of visionary\nmen, to whom these dreams were passing in the form of incredible white\nvapors. Sitting thus, the lads fell to talking of this and the other,\nand Manuel found that Niafer was a pagan of the old faith: and this,\nsaid Manuel, was an excellent thing.\n\n\"For, when we have achieved our adventure,\" says Manuel, \"and must fight\nagainst each other for the Count's daughter, I shall certainly kill you,\ndear Niafer. Now if you were a Christian, and died thus unholily in\ntrying to murder me, you would have to go thereafter to the unquenchable\nflames of purgatory or to even hotter flames: but among the pagans all\nthat die valiantly in battle go straight to the pagan paradise. Yes,\nyes, your abominable religion is a great comfort to me.\"\n\n\"It is a comfort to me also, Manuel. But, as a Christian, you ought not\never to have any kind words for heathenry.\"\n\n\"Ah, but,\" says Manuel, \"while my mother Dorothy of the White Arms was\nthe most zealous sort of Christian, my father, you must know, was not a\ncommunicant.\"\n\n\"Who was your father, Manuel?\"\n\n\"No less a person than the Swimmer, Oriander, who is in turn the son of\nMimir.\"\n\n\"Ah, to be sure! and who is Mimir?\"\n\n\"Well, Niafer, that is a thing not very generally known, but he is famed\nfor his wise head.\"\n\n\"And, Manuel, who, while we speak of it, is Oriander?\"\n\nSaid Manuel:\n\n\"Oh, out of the void and the darkness that is peopled by Mimir's brood,\nfrom the ultimate silent fastness of the desolate deep-sea gloom, and\nthe peace of that ageless gloom, blind Oriander came, from Mimir, to be\nat war with the sea and to jeer at the sea's desire. When tempests are\nseething and roaring from the Aesir's inverted bowl all seamen have\nheard his shouting and the cry that his mirth sends up: when the rim of\nthe sea tilts up, and the world's roof wavers down, his face gleams\nwhite where distraught waves smite the Swimmer they may not tire. No\neyes were allotted this Swimmer, but in blindness, with ceaseless jeers,\nhe battles till time be done with, and the love-songs of earth be sung,\nand the very last dirge be sung, and a baffled and outworn sea\nbegrudgingly own Oriander alone may mock at the might of its ire.\"\n\n\"Truly, Manuel, that sounds like a parent to be proud of, and not at all\nlike a church-going parent, and of course his blindness would account\nfor that squint of yours. Yes, certainly it would. So do you tell me\nabout this blind Oriander, and how he came to meet your mother Dorothy\nof the White Arms, as I suppose he did somewhere or other.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" says Manuel, \"for Oriander never leaves off swimming, and so\nhe must stay always in the water. So he never actually met my mother,\nand she married Emmerick, who was my nominal father. But such and such\nthings happened.\"\n\nThen Manuel told Niafer all about the circumstances of Manuel's birth in\na cave, and about the circumstances of Manuel's upbringing in and near\nRathgor and the two boys talked on and on, while the unborn dreams went\ndrifting by outside; and within the small wrinkled old man sat listening\nwith a very doubtful smile, and saying never a word.\n\n\"And why is your hair cut so queerly, Manuel?\"\n\n\"That, Niafer, we need not talk about, in part because it is not going\nto be cut that way any longer, and in part because it is time for bed.\"\n\nThe next morning Manuel and Niafer paid the ancient price which their\nhost required. They left him cobbling shoes, and, still ascending,\nencountered no more bones, for nobody else had climbed so high. They\npresently came to a bridge whereon were eight spears, and the bridge was\nguarded by the Serpent of the West. This snake was striped with blue and\ngold, and wore on his head a great cap of humming-birds' feathers.\n\nManuel half drew his sword to attack this serpentine design, with which\nMiramon Lluagor made sleeping terrible for the red tribes that hunt and\nfish behind the Hesperides. But Manuel looked at Niafer.\n\nAnd Niafer displayed a drolly marked small turtle, saying, \"Maskanako,\ndo you not recognize Tulapin, the turtle that never lies?\"\n\nThe serpent howled, as though a thousand dogs had been kicked\nsimultaneously, and the serpent fled.\n\n\"Why, snip, did he do that?\" asked Manuel, smiling sleepily and gravely,\nas for the third time he found that his charmed sword Flamberge was\nunneeded.\n\n\"Truly, Manuel, nobody knows why this serpent dreads the turtle: but our\nconcern is less with the cause than with the effect. Meanwhile, those\neight spears are not to be touched on any account.\"\n\n\"Is what you have a quite ordinary turtle?\" asked Manuel, meekly.\n\nNiafer said: \"Of course it is. Where would I be getting extraordinary\nturtles?\"\n\n\"I had not previously considered that problem,\" replied Manuel, \"but the\nquestion is certainly unanswerable.\"\n\nThey then sat down to lunch, and found the bread and cheese they had\npurchased from the little old man that morning was turned to lumps of\nsilver and virgin gold in Manuel's knapsack. \"This is very disgusting,\"\nsaid Manuel, \"and I do not wonder my back was near breaking.\" He flung\naway the treasure, and they lunched frugally on blackberries.\n\nFrom among the entangled blackberry bushes came the glowing Serpent of\nthe South, who was the smallest and loveliest and most poisonous of\nMiramon's designs. With this snake Niafer dealt curiously. Niafer\nemployed three articles in the transaction: two of these things are not\nto be talked about, but the third was a little figure carved in\nhazel-wood.\n\n\"Certainly you are very clever,\" said Manuel, when they had passed this\nserpent. \"Still, your employment of those first two articles was\nunprecedented, and your disposal of the carved figure absolutely\nembarrassed me.\"\n\n\"Before such danger as confronted us, Manuel, it does not pay to be\nsqueamish,\" replied Niafer, \"and my exorcism was good Dirgham.\"\n\nAnd many other adventures and perils they encountered, such as if all\nwere told would make a long and most improbable history. But they had\nclear favorable weather, and they won through each pinch, by one or\nanother fraud which Niafer evolved the instant that gullery was needed.\nManuel was loud in his praises of the surprising cleverness of his\nflat-faced dark comrade, and protested that hourly he loved Niafer more\nand more: and Manuel said too that he was beginning to think more and\nmore distastefully of the time when Niafer and Manuel would have to\nfight for the Count of Arnaye's daughter until one of them had killed\nthe other.\n\nMeanwhile the sword Flamberge stayed in its curious blue scabbard.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nIn the Doubtful Palace\n\n\nSo Manuel and Niafer came unhurt to the top of the gray mountain called\nVraidex, and to the doubtful palace of Miramon Lluagor. Gongs, slowly\nstruck, were sounding as if in languid dispute among themselves, when\nthe two lads came across a small level plain where grass was\ninterspersed with white clover. Here and there stood wicked looking\ndwarf trees with violet and yellow foliage. The doubtful palace before\nthe circumspectly advancing boys appeared to be constructed of black and\ngold lacquer, and it was decorated with the figures of butterflies and\ntortoises and swans.\n\nThis day being a Thursday, Manuel and Niafer entered unchallenged\nthrough gates of horn and ivory; and came into a red corridor in which\nfive gray beasts, like large hairless cats, were casting dice. These\nanimals grinned, and licked their lips, as the boys passed deeper into\nthe doubtful palace.\n\nIn the centre of the palace Miramon had set like a tower one of the\ntusks of Behemoth: the tusk was hollowed out into five large rooms, and\nin the inmost room, under a canopy with green tassels, they found the\nmagician.\n\n\"Come forth, and die now, Miramon Lluagor!\" shouts Manuel, brandishing\nhis sword, for which, at last, employment was promised here.\n\nThe magician drew closer about him his old threadbare dressing-gown, and\nhe desisted from his enchantments, and he put aside a small unfinished\ndesign, which scuttled into the fireplace, whimpering. And Manuel\nperceived that the dreadful prince of the seven madnesses had the\nappearance of the mild-mannered stranger who had given Manuel the\ncharmed sword.\n\n\"Ah, yes, it was good of you to come so soon,\" says Miramon Lluagor,\nrearing back his head, and narrowing his gentle and sombre eyes, as the\nmagician looked at them down the sides of what little nose he had. \"Yes,\nand your young friend, too, is very welcome. But you boys must be quite\nworn out, after toiling up this mountain, so do you sit down and have a\ncup of wine before I surrender my dear wife.\"\n\nSays Manuel, sternly, \"But what is the meaning of all this?\"\n\n\"The meaning and the upshot, clearly,\" replied the magician, \"is that,\nsince you have the charmed sword Flamberge, and since the wearer of\nFlamberge is irresistible, it would be nonsense for me to oppose you.\"\n\n\"But, Miramon, it was you who gave me the sword!\"\n\nMiramon rubbed his droll little nose for a while, before speaking. \"And\nhow else was I to get conquered? For, I must tell you, Manuel, it is a\nlaw of the L\u00e9shy that a magician cannot surrender his prey unless the\nmagician be conquered. I must tell you, too, that when I carried off\nGis\u00e8le I acted, as I by and by discovered, rather injudiciously.\"\n\n\"Now, by holy Paul and Pollux! I do not understand this at all,\nMiramon.\"\n\n\"Why, Manuel, you must know she was a very charming girl, and in\nappearance just the type that I had always fancied for a wife. But\nperhaps it is not wise to be guided entirely by appearances. For I find\nnow that she has a strong will in her white bosom, and a tireless tongue\nin her glittering head, and I do not equally admire all four of these\npossessions.\"\n\n\"Still, Miramon, if only a few months back your love was so great as to\nlead you into abducting her--\"\n\nThe prince of the seven madnesses said gravely:\n\n\"Love, as I think, is an instant's fusing of shadow and substance. They\nthat aspire to possess love utterly, fall into folly. This is forbidden:\nyou cannot. The lover, beholding that fusing move as a golden-hued\ngoddess, accessible, kindly and priceless, wooes and ill-fatedly wins\nall the substance. The golden-hued shadow dims in the dawn of his\nmarried life, dulled with content, and the shadow vanishes. So there\nremains, for the puzzled husband's embracing, flesh which is fair and\ndear, no doubt, yet is flesh such as his; and talking and talking and\ntalking; and kisses in all ways desirable. Love, of a sort, too remains,\nbut hardly the love that was yesterday's.\"\n\nNow the unfinished design came out of the fireplace, and climbed up\nMiramon's leg, still faintly whimpering. He looked at it meditatively,\nthen twisted off the creature's head and dropped the fragments into his\nwaste-basket.\n\nMiramon sighed. He said:\n\n\"This is the cry of all husbands that now are or may be\nhereafter,--'What has become of the girl that I married? and how should\nI rightly deal with this woman whom somehow time has involved in my\ndoings? Love, of a sort, now I have for her, but not the love that was\nyesterday's--'\"\n\nWhile Miramon spoke thus, the two lads were looking at each other\nblankly: for they were young, and their understanding of this matter was\nas yet withheld.\n\nThen said Miramon:\n\n\"Yes, he is wiser that shelters his longing from any such surfeit. Yes,\nhe is wiser that knows the shadow makes lovely the substance, wisely\nregarding the ways of that irresponsible shadow which, if you grasp at\nit, flees, and, when you avoid it, will follow, gilding all life with\nits glory, and keeping always one woman young and most fair and most\nwise, and unwon; and keeping you always never contented, but armed with\na self-respect that no husband manages quite to retain in the face of\nbeing contented. No, for love is an instant's fusing of shadow and\nsubstance, fused for that instant only, whereafter the lover may harvest\npleasure from either alone, but hardly from these two united.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Manuel conceded, \"all this may be true; but I never quite\nunderstood hexameters, and so I could not ever see the good of talking\nin them.\"\n\n\"I always do that, Manuel, when I am deeply affected. It is, I suppose,\nthe poetry in my nature welling to the surface the moment that\ninhibitions are removed, for when I think about the impending severance\nfrom my dear wife I more or less lose control of myself--You see, she\ntakes an active interest in my work, and that does not do with a\ncreative artist in any line. Oh, dear me, no, not for a moment!\" says\nMiramon, forlornly.\n\n\"But how can that be?\" Niafer asked him.\n\n\"As all persons know, I design the dreams of men. Now Gis\u00e8le asserts\nthat people have enough trouble in real life, without having to go to\nsleep to look for it--\"\n\n\"Certainly that is true,\" says Niafer.\n\n\"So she permits me only to design bright optimistic dreams and edifying\ndreams and glad dreams. She says you must give tired persons what they\nmost need; and is emphatic about the importance of everybody's sleeping\nin a wholesome atmosphere. So I have not been permitted to design a fine\nnightmare or a creditable terror--nothing morbid or blood-freezing, no\nsea-serpents or krakens or hippogriffs, nor anything that gives me a\nreally free hand,--for months and months: and my art suffers. Then, as\nfor other dreams, of a more roguish nature--\"\n\n\"What sort of dreams can you be talking about, I wonder, Miramon?\"\n\nThe magician described what he meant. \"Such dreams also she has quite\nforbidden,\" he added, with a sigh.\n\n\"I see,\" said Manuel: \"and now I think of it, it is true that I have not\nhad a dream of that sort for quite a while.\"\n\n\"No man anywhere is allowed to have that sort of dream in these\ndegenerate nights, no man anywhere in the whole world. And here again my\nart suffers, for my designs in this line were always especially vivid\nand effective, and pleased the most rigid. Then, too, Gis\u00e8le is always\ndoing and telling me things for my own good--In fine, my lads, my wife\ntakes such a flattering interest in all my concerns that the one way out\nfor any peace-loving magician was to contrive her rescue from my\nclutches,\" said Miramon, fretfully.\n\n\"It is difficult to explain to you, Manuel, just now, but after you have\nbeen married to Gis\u00e8le for a while you will comprehend without any\nexplaining.\"\n\n\"Now, Miramon, I marvel to see a great magician controlled by a woman\nwho is in his power, and who can, after all, do nothing but talk.\"\n\nMiramon for some while considered Manuel, rather helplessly. \"Unmarried\nmen do wonder about that,\" said Miramon. \"At all events, I will summon\nher, and you can explain how you have conquered me, and then you can\ntake her away and marry her yourself, and Heaven help you!\"\n\n\"But shall I explain that it was you who gave me the resistless sword?\"\n\n\"No, Manuel: no, you should be candid within more rational limits. For\nyou are now a famous champion, that has crowned with victory a righteous\ncause for which many stalwart knights and gallant gentlemen have made\nthe supreme sacrifice, because they knew that in the end the right must\nconquer. Your success thus represents the working out of a great moral\nprinciple, and to explain the practical minutiae of these august\nprocesses is not always quite respectable. Besides, if Gis\u00e8le thought I\nwished to get rid of her she would most certainly resort to comments of\nwhich I prefer not to think.\"\n\nBut now into the room came the magician's wife, Gis\u00e8le.\n\n\"She is, certainly, rather pretty,\" said Niafer, to Manuel.\n\nSaid Manuel, rapturously: \"She is the finest and loveliest creature that\nI have ever seen. Beholding her unequalled beauty, I know that here are\nall the dreams of yesterday fulfilled. I recollect, too, my songs of\nyesterday, which I was used to sing to my pigs, about my love for a far\nprincess who was 'white as a lily, more red than roses, and resplendent\nas rubies of the Orient,' for here I find my old songs to be applicable,\nif rather inadequate. And by this shabby villain's failure to appreciate\nthe unequalled beauty of his victim I am amazed.\"\n\n\"As to that, I have my suspicions,\" Niafer replied. \"And now she is\nabout to speak I believe she will justify these suspicions, for Madame\nGis\u00e8le is in no placid frame of mind.\"\n\n\"What is this nonsense,\" says the proud shining lady, to Miramon\nLluagor, \"that I hear about your having been conquered?\"\n\n\"Alas, my love, it is perfectly true. This champion has, in some\ninexplicable way, come by the magic weapon Flamberge which is the one\nweapon wherewith I can be conquered. So I have yielded to him, and he is\nabout, I think, to sever my head from my body.\"\n\nThe beautiful girl was indignant, because she had recognized that,\nmagician or no, there is small difference in husbands after the first\nmonth or two; and with Miramon tolerably well trained, she had no\nintention of changing him for another husband. Therefore Gis\u00e8le\ninquired, \"And what about me?\" in a tone that foreboded turmoil.\n\nThe magician rubbed his hands, uncomfortably. \"My dear, I am of course\nquite powerless before Flamberge. Inasmuch as your rescue appears to\nhave been effected in accordance with every rule in these matters, and\nthe victorious champion is resolute to requite my evil-doing and to\nrestore you to your grieving parents, I am afraid there is nothing I can\nwell do about it.\"\n\n\"Do you look me in the eye, Miramon Lluagor!\" says the Lady Gis\u00e8le. The\ndreadful prince of the seven madnesses obeyed her, with a placating\nsmile. \"Yes, you have been up to something,\" she said, \"And Heaven only\nknows what, though of course it does not really matter.\"\n\nMadame Gis\u00e8le then looked at Manuel \"So you are the champion that has\ncome to rescue me!\" she said, unhastily, as her big sapphire eyes\nappraised him over her great fan of gaily colored feathers, and as\nManuel somehow began to fidget.\n\nGis\u00e8le looked last of all at Niafer. \"I must say you have been long\nenough in coming,\" observed Gis\u00e8le.\n\n\"It took me two days, madame, to find and catch a turtle,\" Niafer\nreplied, \"and that delayed me.\"\n\n\"Oh, you have always some tale or other, trust you for that, but it is\nbetter late than never. Come, Niafer, and do you know anything about\nthis gawky, ragtag, yellow-haired young champion?\"\n\n\"Yes, madame, he formerly lived in attendance upon the miller's pigs,\ndown Rathgor way, and I have seen him hanging about the kitchen at\nArnaye.\"\n\nGis\u00e8le turned now toward the magician, with her thin gold chains and the\ninnumerable brilliancies of her jewels flashing no more brightly than\nflashed the sapphire of her eyes. \"There!\" she said, terribly: \"and you\nwere going to surrender me to a swineherd, with half the hair chopped\nfrom his head, and with the shirt sticking out of both his ragged\nelbows!\"\n\n\"My dearest, irrespective of tonsorial tastes, and disregarding all\nsartorial niceties, and swineherd or not, he holds the magic sword\nFlamberge, before which all my powers are nothing.\"\n\n\"But that is easily settled. Have men no sense whatever! Boy, do you\ngive me that sword, before you hurt yourself fiddling with it, and let\nus have an end of this nonsense.\"\n\nThus the proud lady spoke, and for a while the victorious champion\nregarded her with very youthful looking, hurt eyes. But he was not\nrouted.\n\n\"Madame Gis\u00e8le,\" replied Manuel, \"gawky and poorly clad and young as I\nmay be, so long as I retain this sword I am master of you all and of the\nfuture too. Yielding it, I yield everything my elders have taught me to\nprize, for my grave elders have taught me that much wealth and broad\nlands and a lovely wife are finer things to ward than a parcel of pigs.\nSo, if I yield at all, I must first bargain and get my price for\nyielding.\"\n\nHe turned now from Gis\u00e8le to Niafer. \"Dear snip,\" said Manuel, \"you too\nmust have your say in my bargaining, because from the first it has been\nyour cleverness that has saved us, and has brought us two so high. For\nsee, at last I have drawn Flamberge, and I stand at last at the doubtful\nsummit of Vraidex, and I am master of the hour and of the future. I have\nbut to sever the wicked head of this doomed magician from his foul body,\nand that will be the end of him--\"\n\n\"No, no,\" says Miramon, soothingly, \"I shall merely be turned into\nsomething else, which perhaps we had better not discuss. But it will not\ninconvenience me in the least, so do you not hold back out of mistaken\nkindness to me, but instead do you smite, and take your well-earned\nreward.\"\n\n\"Either way,\" submitted Manuel, \"I have but to strike, and I acquire\nmuch wealth and sleek farming-lands and a lovely wife, and the swineherd\nbecomes a great nobleman. But it is you, Niafer, who have won all these\nthings for me with your cleverness, and to me it seems that these\nwonderful rewards are less wonderful than my dear comrade.\"\n\n\"But you too are very wonderful,\" said Niafer, loyally.\n\nSays Manuel, smiling sadly: \"I am not so wonderful but that in the hour\nof my triumph I am frightened by my own littleness. Look you, Niafer, I\nhad thought I would be changed when I had become a famous champion, but\nfor all that I stand posturing here with this long sword, and am master\nof the hour and of the future, I remain the boy that last Thursday was\ntending pigs. I was not afraid of the terrors which beset me on my way\nto rescue the Count's daughter, but of the Count's daughter herself I am\nhorribly afraid. Not for worlds would I be left alone with her. No, such\nfine and terrific ladies are not for swineherds, and it is another sort\nof wife that I desire.\"\n\n\"Whom then do you desire for a wife,\" says Niafer, \"if not the loveliest\nand the wealthiest lady in all Rathgor and Lower Targamon?\"\n\n\"Why, I desire the cleverest and dearest and most wonderful creature in\nall the world,\" says Manuel,--\"whom I recollect seeing some six weeks\nago when I was in the kitchen at Arnaye.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah! it might be arranged, then. But who is this marvelous woman?\"\n\nManuel said, \"You are that woman, Niafer.\"\n\nNiafer replied nothing, but Niafer smiled. Niafer raised one shoulder a\nlittle, rubbing it against Manuel's broad chest, but Niafer still kept\nsilence. So the two young people regarded each other for a while, not\nspeaking, and to every appearance not valuing Miramon Lluagor and his\nencompassing enchantments at a straw's worth, nor valuing anything save\neach other.\n\n\"All things are changed for me,\" says Manuel, presently, in a hushed\nvoice, \"and for the rest of time I live in a world wherein Niafer\ndiffers from all other persons.\"\n\n\"My dearest,\" Niafer replied, \"there is no sparkling queen nor polished\nprincess anywhere but the woman's heart in her would be jumping with joy\nto have you looking at her twice, and I am only a servant girl!\"\n\n\"But certainly,\" said the rasping voice of Gis\u00e8le, \"Niafer is my\nsuitably disguised heathen waiting-woman, to whom my husband sent a\ndream some while ago, with instructions to join me here, so that I might\nhave somebody to look after my things. So, Niafer, since you were\nfetched to wait on me, do you stop pawing at that young pig-tender, and\ntell me what is this I hear about your remarkable cleverness!\"\n\nInstead, it was Manuel who proudly told of the shrewd devices through\nwhich Niafer had passed the serpents and the other terrors of sleep. And\nthe while that the tall boy was boasting, Miramon Lluagor smiled, and\nGis\u00e8le looked very hard at Niafer: for Miramon and his wife both knew\nthat the cleverness of Niafer was as far to seek as her good looks, and\nthat the dream which Miramon had sent had carefully instructed Niafer as\nto these devices.\n\n\"Therefore, Madame Gis\u00e8le,\" says Manuel, in conclusion, \"I will give you\nFlamberge, and Miramon and Vraidex, and all the rest of earth to boot,\nin exchange for the most wonderful and clever woman in the world.\"\n\nAnd with a flourish, Manuel handed over the charmed sword Flamberge to\nthe Count's lovely daughter, and he took the hand of the swart,\nflat-faced servant girl.\n\n\"Come now,\" says Miramon, in a sad flurry, \"this is an imposing\nperformance. I need not say it arouses in me the most delightful sort of\nsurprise and all other appropriate emotions. But as touches your own\ninterests, Manuel, do you think your behavior is quite sensible?\"\n\nTall Manuel looked down upon him with a sort of scornful pity. \"Yes,\nMiramon: for I am Manuel, and I follow after my own thinking and my own\ndesire. Of course it is very fine of me to be renouncing so much wealth\nand power for the sake of my wonderful dear Niafer: but she is worth the\nsacrifice, and, besides, she is witnessing all this magnanimity, and\ncannot well fail to be impressed.\"\n\nNiafer was of course reflecting: \"This is very foolish and dear of him,\nand I shall be compelled, in mere decency, to pretend to corresponding\nlunacies for the first month or so of our marriage. After that, I hope,\nwe will settle down to some more reasonable way of living.\"\n\nMeanwhile she regarded Manuel fondly, and quite as though she considered\nhim to be displaying unusual intelligence.\n\nBut Gis\u00e8le and Miramon were looking at each other, and wondering: \"What\ncan the long-legged boy see in this stupid and plain-featured girl who\nis years older than he? or she in the young swaggering ragged fool? And\nhow much wiser and happier is our marriage than, in any event, the\naverage marriage!\"\n\nAnd Miramon, for one, was so deeply moved by the staggering thought\nwhich holds together so many couples in the teeth of human nature that\nhe patted his wife's hand. Then he sighed. \"Love has conquered my\ndesigns,\" said Miramon, oracularly, \"and the secret of a contented\nmarriage, after all, is to pay particular attention to the wives of\neverybody else.\"\n\nGis\u00e8le exhorted him not to be a fool, but she spoke without acerbity,\nand, speaking, she squeezed his hand. She understood this potent\nmagician better than she intended ever to permit him to suspect.\n\nWhereafter Miramon wiped the heavenly bodies from the firmament, and set\na miraculous rainbow there, and under its arch was enacted for the\nswineherd and the servant girl such a betrothal masque of fantasies and\nillusions as gave full scope to the art of Miramon, and delighted\neverybody, but delighted Miramon in particular. The dragon that guards\nhidden treasure made sport for them, the naiads danced, and cherubim\nfluttered about singing very sweetly and asking droll conundrums. Then\nthey feasted, with unearthly servitors to attend them, and did all else\nappropriate to an affiancing of deities. And when these junketings were\nover, Manuel said that, since it seemed he was not to be a wealthy\nnobleman after all, he and Niafer must be getting, first to the nearest\npriest's and then back to the pigs.\n\n\"I am not so sure that you can manage it,\" said Miramon, \"for, while the\nascent of Vraidex is incommoded by serpents, the quitting of Vraidex is\nvery apt to be hindered by death and fate. For I must tell you I have a\nrather arbitrary half-brother, who is one of those dreadful Realists,\nwithout a scrap of aesthetic feeling, and there is no controlling him.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Manuel considered, \"one cannot live forever among dreams, and\ndeath and fate must be encountered by all men. So we can but try.\"\n\nNow for a while the sombre eyes of Miramon Lluagor appraised them. He,\nwho was lord of the nine sleeps and prince of the seven madnesses, now\ngave a little sigh; for he knew that these young people were enviable\nand, in the outcome, were unimportant.\n\nSo Miramon said, \"Then do you go your way, and if you do not encounter\nthe author and destroyer of us all it will be well for you, and if you\ndo encounter him that too will be well in that it is his wish.\"\n\n\"I neither seek nor avoid him,\" Manuel replied. \"I only know that I must\nfollow after my own thinking, and after a desire which is not to be\nsatisfied with dreams, even though they be\"--the boy appeared to search\nfor a comparison, then, smiling, said,--\"as resplendent as rubies of the\nOrient.\"\n\nThereafter Manuel bid farewell to Miramon and Miramon's fine wife, and\nManuel descended from marvelous Vraidex with his plain-featured Niafer,\nquite contentedly. For happiness went with them, if for no great way.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nThe Eternal Ambuscade\n\n\nManuel and Niafer came down from Vraidex without hindrance. There was no\nhappier nor more devoted lover anywhere than young Manuel.\n\n\"For we will be married out of hand, dear snip,\" he says, \"and you will\nhelp me to discharge my geas, and afterward we will travel everywhither\nand into the last limits of earth, so that we may see the ends of this\nworld and may judge them.\"\n\n\"Perhaps we had better wait until next spring, when the roads will be\nbetter, Manuel, but certainly we will be married out of hand.\"\n\nIn earnest of this, Niafer permitted Manuel to kiss her again, and young\nManuel said, for the twenty-second time, \"There is nowhere any happiness\nlike my happiness, nor any love like my love.\"\n\nThus speaking, and thus disporting themselves, they came leisurely to\nthe base of the gray mountain and to the old maple-trees, under which\nthey found two persons waiting. One was a tall man mounted on a white\nhorse, and leading a riderless black horse. His hat was pulled down\nabout his head so that his face could not be clearly seen.\n\nNow the companion that was with him had the appearance of a bare-headed\nyoungster, with dark red hair, and his face too was hidden as he sat by\nthe roadway trimming his long finger-nails with a small green-handled\nknife.\n\n\"Hail, friends,\" said Manuel, \"and for whom are you waiting here?\"\n\n\"I wait for one to ride on this black horse of mine,\" replied the\nmounted stranger. \"It was decreed that the first person who passed this\nway must be his rider, but you two come abreast. So do you choose\nbetween you which one rides.\"\n\n\"Well, but it is a fine steed surely,\" Manuel said, \"and a steed fit for\nCharlemagne or Hector or any of the famous champions of the old time.\"\n\n\"Each one of them has ridden upon this black horse of mine,\" replied the\nstranger.\n\nNiafer said, \"I am frightened.\" And above them a furtive wind began to\nrustle in the torn, discolored maple-leaves.\n\n\"--For it is a fine steed and an old steed,\" the stranger went on, \"and\na tireless steed that bears all away. It has the fault, some say, that\nits riders do not return, but there is no pleasing everybody.\"\n\n\"Friend,\" Manuel said, in a changed voice, \"who are you, and what is\nyour name?\"\n\n\"I am half-brother to Miramon Lluagor, lord of the nine sleeps, but I am\nlord of another kind of sleeping; and as for my name, it is the name\nthat is in your thoughts and the name which most troubles you, and the\nname which you think about most often.\"\n\nThere was silence. Manuel worked his lips foolishly. \"I wish we had not\nwalked abreast,\" he said. \"I wish we had remained among the bright\ndreams.\"\n\n\"All persons voice some regret or another at meeting me. And it does not\never matter.\"\n\n\"But if there were no choosing in the affair, I could make\nshift to endure it, either way. Now one of us, you tell me, must depart\nwith you. If I say, 'Let Niafer be that one,' I must always recall that\nsaying with self-loathing.\"\n\n\"But I too say it!\" Niafer was petting him and trembling.\n\n\"Besides,\" observed the rider of the white horse, \"you have a choice of\nsayings.\"\n\n\"The other saying,\" Manuel replied, \"I cannot utter. Yet I wish I were\nnot forced to confess this. It sounds badly. At all events, I love\nNiafer better than I love any other person, but I do not value Niafer's\nlife more highly than I value my own life, and it would be nonsense to\nsay so. No; my life is very necessary to me, and there is a geas upon me\nto make a figure in this world before I leave it.\"\n\n\"My dearest,\" says Niafer, \"you have chosen wisely.\"\n\nThe veiled horseman said nothing at all. But he took off his hat, and\nthe beholders shuddered. The kinship to Miramon was apparent, you could\nsee the resemblance, but they had never seen in Miramon Lluagor's face\nwhat they saw here.\n\nThen Niafer bade farewell to Manuel with pitiable whispered words. They\nkissed. For an instant Manuel stood motionless. He queerly moved his\nmouth, as though it were stiff and he were trying to make it more\nsupple. Thereafter Manuel, very sick and desperate looking, did what was\nrequisite. So Niafer went away with Grandfather Death, in Manuel's\nstead.\n\n\"My heart cracks in me now,\" says Manuel, forlornly considering his\nhands, \"but better she than I. Still, this is a poor beginning in life,\nfor yesterday great wealth and to-day great love was within my reach,\nand now I have lost both.\"\n\n\"But you did not go the right way about to win success in anything,\"\nsays the remaining stranger.\n\nAnd now this other stranger arose from the trimming of his long\nfingernails; and you could see this was a tall, lean youngster (though\nnot so tall as Manuel, and nothing like so stalwart), with ruddy cheeks,\nwide-set brown eyes, and crinkling, rather dark red hair.\n\nThen Manuel rubbed his wet hands as clean as might be, and this boy\nwalked on a little way with Manuel, talking of that which had been and\nof some things which were to be. And Manuel said, \"Now assuredly,\nHorvendile, since that is your name, such talking is insane talking, and\nno comfort whatever to me in my grief at losing Niafer.\"\n\n\"This is but the beginning of your losses, Manuel, for I think that a\nlittle by a little you will lose everything which is desirable, until\nyou shall have remaining at the last only a satiation, and a weariness,\nand an uneasy loathing of all that the human wisdom of your elders shall\nhave induced you to procure.\"\n\n\"But, Horvendile, can anybody foretell the future? Or can it be that\nMiramon spoke seriously in saying that fate also was enleagued to forbid\nthe leaving of this mountain?\"\n\n\"No, Manuel, I do not say that I am fate nor any of the L\u00e9shy, but\nrather it seems to me that I am insane. So perhaps the less attention\nyou pay to my talking, the better. For I must tell you that this wasted\ncountry side, this mountain, this road, and these old maples, and that\nrock yonder, appear to me to be things I have imagined, and that you,\nand the Niafer whom you have just disposed of so untidily, and Miramon\nand his fair shrew, and all of you, appear to me to be persons I have\nimagined; and all the living in this world appears to me to be only a\nnotion of mine.\"\n\n\"Why, then, certainly I would say, or rather, I would think it\nunnecessary to say, that you are insane.\"\n\n\"You speak without hesitation, and it is through your ability to settle\nsuch whimseys out of hand that you will yet win, it may be, to success.\"\n\n\"Yes, but,\" asked Manuel, slowly, \"what is success?\"\n\n\"In your deep mind, I think, that question is already answered.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly I have my notion, but it was about your notion I was\nasking.\"\n\nHorvendile looked grave, and yet whimsical too. \"Why, I have heard\nsomewhere,\" says he, \"that at its uttermost this success is but the\nstrivings of an ape reft of his tail, and grown rusty at climbing, who\nyet feels himself to be a symbol and the frail representative of\nOmnipotence in a place that is not home.\"\n\nManuel appeared to reserve judgment. \"How does the successful ape employ\nhimself, in these not quite friendly places?\"\n\n\"He strives blunderingly, from mystery to mystery, with pathetic\nmakeshifts, not understanding anything, greedy in all desires, and\nhoneycombed with poltroonery, and yet ready to give all, and to die\nfighting for the sake of that undemonstrable idea, about his being\nHeaven's vicar and heir.\"\n\nManuel shook his small bright head. \"You use too many long words. But so\nfar I can understand you, that is not the sort of success I want. No, I\nam Manuel, and I must follow after my own thinking and my own desire,\nwithout considering other people and their notions of success.\"\n\n\"As for denying yourself consideration for other people, I am of the\nopinion, after witnessing your recent disposal of your sweetheart, that\nyou are already tolerably expert in that sort of abnegation.\"\n\n\"Hah, but you do not know what is seething here,\" replied Manuel,\nsmiting his broad chest. \"And I shall not tell you of it, Horvendile,\nsince you are not fate nor any of the L\u00e9shy, to give me my desire.\"\n\n\"What would be your desire?\"\n\n\"My wish would be for me always to obtain whatever I may wish for. Yes,\nHorvendile, I have often wondered why, in the old legends, when three\nwishes were being offered, nobody ever made that sensible and economical\nwish the first of all.\"\n\n\"What need is there to trouble the L\u00e9shy about that foolish wish when it\nis always possible, at a paid price, to obtain whatever one desires? You\nhave but to go about it in this way.\" And Horvendile told Manuel a queer\nand dangerous thing. Then Horvendile said sadly: \"So much knowledge I\ncan deny nobody at Michaelmas. But I must tell you the price also, and\nit is that with the achieving of each desire you will perceive its\nworth.\"\n\nThus speaking, Horvendile parted the thicket beside the roadway. A\nbeautiful dusk-colored woman waited there, in a green-blue robe, and on\nher head was a blue coronet surmounted with green feathers: she carried\na vase. Horvendile stepped forward, and the thicket closed behind him,\nconcealing Horvendile and this woman.\n\nManuel, looking puzzled, went on a little way, and when he was assured\nof being alone he flung himself face downward and wept. The reason of\nthis was, they relate, that young Manuel had loved Niafer as he could\nlove nobody else. Then he arose, and went toward the pool of Haranton,\non his way homeward, after having failed in everything.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nEconomics of Math\n\n\nWhat forthwith happened at the pool of Haranton is not nicely adapted to\nexact description, but it was sufficiently curious to give Manuel's\nthoughts a new turn, although it did not seem, even so, to make them\nhappy thoughts. Certainly it was not with any appearance of merriment\nthat Manuel returned to his half-sister Math, who was the miller's wife.\n\n\"And wherever have you been all this week?\" says Math, \"with the pigs\nrooting all over creation, and with that man of mine forever flinging\nyour worthlessness in my face, and with that red-haired Suskind coming\nout of the twilight a-seeking after you every evening and pestering me\nwith her soft lamentations? And for the matter of that, whatever are you\nglooming over?\"\n\n\"I have cause, and cause to spare.\"\n\nManuel told her of his adventures upon Vraidex, and Math said that\nshowed what came of neglecting his proper business, which was attendance\non her husband's pigs. Manuel then told her of what had just befallen by\nthe pool of Haranton.\n\nMath nodded. \"Take shame to yourself, young rascal with your Niafer\nhardly settled down in paradise, and with your Suskind wailing for you\nin the twilight! But that would be Alianora the Unattainable Princess.\nThus she comes across the Bay of Biscay, traveling from the far land of\nProvence, in, they say, the appearance of a swan: and thus she bathes in\nthe pool wherein strange dreams engender: and thus she slips into the\nrobe of the Apsarasas when it is high time to be leaving such impudent\nknaves as you have proved yourself to be.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes! a shift made all of shining white feathers, Sister. Here is a\nfeather that was broken from it as I clutched at her.\"\n\nMath turned the feather in her hand. \"Now to be sure! and did you ever\nsee the like of it! Still, a broken feather is no good to anybody, and,\nas I have told you any number of times, I cannot have trash littering up\nmy kitchen.\"\n\nSo Math dropped this shining white feather into the fire, on which she\nwas warming over a pot of soup for Manuel's dinner, and they watched\nthis feather burn.\n\nManuel says, sighing, \"Even so my days consume, and my youth goes out of\nme, in a land wherein Suskind whispers of uncomfortable things, and\nwherein there are no maids so clever and dear as Niafer, nor so lovely\nas Alianora.\"\n\nMath said: \"I never held with speaking ill of the dead. So may luck and\nfair words go with your Niafer in her pagan paradise. Of your Suskind\ntoo\"--Math crossed herself,--\"the less said, the better. But as for your\nAlianora, no really nice girl would be flying in the face of heaven and\nshowing her ankles to five nations, and bathing, on a Monday too, in\nplaces where almost anybody might come along. It is not proper, but I\nwonder at her parents.\"\n\n\"But, Sister, she is a princess!\"\n\n\"Just so: therefore I burned the feather, because it is not wholesome\nfor persons of our station in life to be robbing princesses of anything,\nthough it be only of a feather.\"\n\n\"Sister, that is the truth! It is not right to rob anybody of anything,\nand this would appear to make another bond upon me and another\nobligation to be discharged, because in taking that feather I have taken\nwhat did not belong to me.\"\n\n\"Boy, do not think you are fooling me, for when your face gets that look\non it, I know you are considering some nonsense over and above the\nnonsense you are talking. However, from your description of the affair,\nI do not doubt that gallivanting, stark-naked princess thought you were\nfor taking what did not belong to you. Therefore I burned the feather,\nlest it be recognized and bring you to the gallows or to a worse place.\nSo why did you not scrape your feet before coming into my clean kitchen?\nand how many times do you expect me to speak to you about that?\"\n\nManuel said nothing. But he seemed to meditate over something that\npuzzled him. In the upshot he went into the miller's chicken-yard, and\ncaught a goose, and plucked from its wing a feather.\n\nThen Manuel put on his Sunday clothes.\n\n\"Far too good for you to be traveling in,\" said Math.\n\nManuel looked down at his half-sister, and once or twice he blinked\nthose shining strange eyes of his. \"Sister, if I had been properly\ndressed when I was master of the doubtful palace, the Lady Gis\u00e8le would\nhave taken me quite seriously. I have been thinking about her\nobservations as to my elbows.\"\n\n\"The coat does not make the man,\" replied Math piously.\n\n\"It is your belief in any such saying that has made a miller's wife of\nyou, and will keep you a miller's wife until the end of time. Now I\nlearned better from my misadventures upon Vraidex, and from my talking\nwith that insane Horvendile about the things which have been and some\nthings which are to be.\"\n\nMath, who was a wise woman, said queerly, \"I perceive that you are\nletting your hair grow.\"\n\nManuel said, \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Boy, fast and loose is a mischancy game to play.\"\n\n\"And being born, also, is a most hazardous speculation, Sister, yet we\nperforce risk all upon that cast.\"\n\n\"Now you talk stuff and nonsense--\"\n\n\"Yes, Sister; but I begin to suspect that the right sort of stuff and\nnonsense is not unremunerative. I may be wrong, but I shall afford my\nnotion a testing.\"\n\n\"And after what shiftless idiocy will you be chasing now, to neglect\nyour work?\"\n\n\"Why, as always, Sister, I must follow my own thinking and my own\ndesire,\" says Manuel, lordlily, \"and both of these are for a flight\nabove pigs.\"\n\nThereafter Manuel kissed Math, and, again without taking leave of\nSuskind in the twilight, or of anyone else, he set forth for the far\nland of Provence.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nThe Crown of Wisdom\n\n\nSo did it come about that as King Helmas rode a-hunting in Nevet under\nthe Hunter's Moon he came upon a gigantic and florid young fellow, who\nwas very decently clad in black, and had a queer droop to his left eye,\nand who appeared to be wandering at adventure in the autumn woods: and\nthe King remembered what had been foretold.\n\nSays King Helmas to Manuel the swineherd, \"What is that I see in your\npocket wrapped in red silk?\"\n\n\"It is a feather, King, wrapped in a bit of my sister's best petticoat\"\n\n\"Now, glory be to your dark magics, friend, and at what price will you\nsell me that feather?\"\n\n\"But a feather is no use to anybody, King, for, as you see, it is a\nquite ordinary feather?\"\n\n\"Come, come!\" the King says, shrewdly, \"do people anywhere wrap ordinary\nfeathers in red silk? Friend, do not think to deceive King Helmas of\nAlbania, or it will be worse for you. I perfectly recognize that shining\nwhite feather as the feather which was moulted in this forest by the\nZhar-Ptitza Bird, in the old time before my grandfathers came into this\ncountry. For it was foretold that such a young sorcerer as you would\nbring to me, who have long been the silliest King that ever reigned over\nthe Peohtes, this feather which confers upon its owner perfect wisdom:\nand for you to dispute the prophecy would be blasphemous.\"\n\n\"I do not dispute your silliness, King Helmas, nor do I dispute\nanybody's prophecies in a world wherein nothing is certain.\"\n\n\"One thing at least is certain,\" remarked King Helmas, frowning uglily,\n\"and it is that among the Peohtes all persons who dispute our prophecies\nare burned at the stake.\"\n\nManuel shivered slightly, and said: \"It seems to me a quite ordinary\nfeather: but your prophets--most deservedly, no doubt,--are in higher\nrepute for wisdom than I am, and burning is a discomfortable death. So I\nrecall what a madman told me, and, since you are assured that this is\nthe Zhar-Ptitza's feather, I will sell it to you for ten sequins.\"\n\nKing Helmas shook a disapproving face. \"That will not do at all, and\nyour price is out of reason, because it was foretold that for this\nfeather you would ask ten thousand sequins.\"\n\n\"Well, I am particularly desirous not to appear irreligious now that I\nhave become a young sorcerer. So you may have the feather at your own\nprice, rather than let the prophecies remain unfulfilled.\"\n\nThen Manuel rode pillion with a king who was unwilling to let Manuel out\nof his sight, and they went thus to the castle called Brunbelois. They\ncame to two doors with pointed arches, set side by side, the smaller\nbeing for foot passengers, and the other for horsemen. Above was an\nequestrian statue in a niche, and a great painted window with traceries\nof hearts and thistles.\n\nThey entered the larger door, and that afternoon twelve heralds, in\nbright red tabards that were embroidered with golden thistles, rode out\nof this door, to proclaim the fulfilment of the prophecy as to the\nZhar-Ptitza's feather, and that afternoon the priests of the Peohtes\ngave thanks in all their curious underground temples. The common people,\nwho had for the last score of years taken shame to themselves for living\nunder such a foolish king, embraced one another, and danced, and sang\npatriotic songs at every street-corner: the Lower Council met, and voted\nthat, out of deference of his majesty, All Fools' Day should be stricken\nfrom the calendar: and Queen Pressina (one of the water folk) declared\nthere were two ways of looking at everything, the while that she burned\na quantity of private papers. Then at night were fireworks, the King\nmade a speech, and to Manuel was delivered in wheel-barrows the sum of\nten thousand sequins.\n\nThereafter Manuel abode for a month at the court of King Helmas, noting\nwhatever to this side and to that side seemed most notable. Manuel was\nwell liked by the nobility, and when the barons and the fine ladies\nassembled in the evening for pavanes and branles and pazzamenos nobody\ndanced more statelily than Messire Manuel. He had a quiet way with the\nladies, and with the barons a way of simplicity which was vastly admired\nin a sorcerer so potent that his magic had secured the long sought\nZhar-Ptitza's feather. \"But the most learned,\" as King Helmas justly\nsaid, \"are always the most modest.\"\n\nHelmas now wore the feather from the wing of the miller's goose affixed\nto the front of Helmas' second best crown, because that was the one he\nused to give judgments in. And when it was noised abroad that King\nHelmas had the Zhar-Ptitza's feather, the Peohtes came gladly to be\njudged, and the neighboring kings began to submit to him their more\ndifficult cases, and all his judgings were received with reverence,\nbecause everybody knew that King Helmas' wisdom was now infallible, and\nthat to criticize his verdict as to anything was merely to expose your\nown stupidity.\n\nAnd now that doubt of himself had gone out of his mind, Helmas lived\nuntroubled, and his digestion improved, and his loving-kindness was\ninfinite, because he could not be angry with the pitiable creatures\nhaled before him, when he considered how little able they were to\ndistinguish between wisdom and unwisdom where Helmas was omniscient: and\nall his doings were merciful and just, and his people praised him. Even\nthe Queen conceded that, once you were accustomed to his ways, and\nexercised some firmness about being made a doormat of, and had it\nunderstood once for all that meals could not be kept waiting for him,\nshe supposed there might be women worse off.\n\nAnd Manuel got clay and modeled the figure of a young man which had the\nfeatures and the wise look of King Helmas.\n\n\"I can see the resemblance,\" the King said, \"but it does not half do me\njustice, and, besides, why have you made a young whipper-snapper of me,\nand mixed up my appearance with your appearance?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" said Manuel, \"but I suppose it is because of a geas\nwhich is upon me to make myself a splendid and admirable young man in\nevery respect, and not an old man.\"\n\n\"And does the sculpture satisfy you?\" asks the King, smiling wisely.\n\n\"No, I like this figure well enough, now it is done, but it is not, I\nsomehow know, the figure I desire to make. No, I must follow after my\nown thinking and my own desire, and wisdom is not requisite to me.\"\n\n\"You artists!\" said the King, as people always say that \"Now I would\nconsider that, for all the might of your sorceries, wisdom is rather\nclamantly requisite to you, Messire Manuel, who inform me you must soon\nbe riding hence to find elsewhere the needful look for your figure. For\nthus to be riding about this world of men, in search of a shade of\nexpression, and without even being certain of what look you are looking\nfor, does not appear to me to be good sense.\"\n\nBut young Manuel replied sturdily:\n\n\"I ride to encounter what life has in store for me, who am made certain\nof this at least, that all high harvests which life withholds for me\nspring from a seed which I sow--and reap. For my geas is potent, and,\nlate or soon, I serve my geas, and take my doom as the pay well-earned\nthat is given as pay to me, for the figure I make in this world of men.\n\n\"This figure, foreseen and yet hidden away from me, glimpsed from afar\nin the light of a dream,--will I love it, once more, or will loathing\nawake in me after its visage is plainlier seen? No matter: as fate says,\nso say I, who serve my geas, and gain in time such payment, at worst, as\nis honestly due to me, for the figure I make in this world of men.\n\n\"To its shaping I consecrate youth that is strong in me, ardently\nyielding youth's last least gift, who know that all grace which the gods\nhave allotted me avails me in naught if it fails me in this. For all\nthat a man has, that must I bring to the image I shape, that my making\nmay live when time unmakes me and death dissevers me from the figure I\nmake in this world of men.\"\n\nTo this the King rather drily replied: \"There is something in what you\nsay. But that something is, I can assure you, not wisdom.\"\n\nSo everyone was satisfied in Albania except Manuel, who declared that he\nwas pleased but not contented by the image he had made in the likeness\nof King Helmas.\n\n\"Besides,\" they told him, \"you look as though your mind were troubling\nyou about something.\"\n\n\"In fact, I am puzzled to see a foolish person made wise in all his\ndeeds and speeches by this wisdom being expected of him.\"\n\n\"But that is a cause for rejoicing, and for applauding the might of your\nsorceries, Messire Manuel, whereas you are plainly thinking of vexatious\nmatters.\"\n\nManuel replied, \"I think that it is not right to rob anybody of\nanything, and I reflect that wisdom weighs exactly the weight of a\nfeather.\"\n\nThen Manuel went into King Helmas' chickenyard, and caught a goose, and\nplucked from its wing a feather. Manuel went glitteringly now, in\nbrocaded hose, and with gold spurs on his heels: the figure which he had\nmade in the likeness of King Helmas was packed in an expensive knapsack\nof ornamented leather, and tall shining Manuel rode on a tall dappled\nhorse when he departed southward, for Manuel nowadays had money to\nspare.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nThe Halo of Holiness\n\n\nNow Manuel takes ship across the fretful Bay of Biscay, traveling always\ntoward Provence and Alianora, whom people called the Unattainable\nPrincess. Oriander the Swimmer followed this ship, they say, but he\nattempted to do Manuel no hurt, at least not for that turn.\n\nSo Manuel of the high head comes into the country of wicked King\nFerdinand; and, toward All-Hallows, they bring a stupendous florid young\nman to the King in the torture-chamber. King Ferdinand was not idle at\nthe moment, and he looked up good-temperedly enough from his employment:\nbut almost instantly his merry face was overcast.\n\n\"Dear me!\" says Ferdinand, as he dropped his white hot pincers\nsizzlingly into a jar of water, \"and I had hoped you would not be\nbothering me for a good ten years!\"\n\n\"Now if I bother you at all it is against my will,\" declared Manuel,\nvery politely, \"nor do I willingly intrude upon you here, for, without\ncriticizing anybody's domestic arrangements, there are one or two things\nthat I do not fancy the looks of in this torture-chamber.\"\n\n\"That is as it may be. In the mean time, what is that I see in your\npocket wrapped in red silk?\"\n\n\"It is a feather, King, wrapped in a bit of my sister's best petticoat.\"\n\nThen Ferdinand sighed, and he arose from his interesting experiments\nwith what was left of the Marquess de Henestrosa, to whom the King had\ntaken a sudden dislike that morning.\n\n\"Tut, tut!\" said Ferdinand: \"yet, after all, I have had a brave time of\nit, with my enormities and my iniquities, and it is not as though there\nwere nothing to look back on! So at what price will you sell me that\nfeather?\"\n\n\"But surely a feather is no use to anybody, King, for does it not seem\nto you a quite ordinary feather?\"\n\n\"Come!\" says King Ferdinand, as he washed his hands, \"do people anywhere\nwrap ordinary feathers in red silk? You squinting rascal, do not think\nto swindle me out of eternal bliss by any such foolish talk! I perfectly\nrecognize that feather as the feather which Milcah plucked from the left\npinion of the Archangel Oriphiel when the sons of God were on more\nintricate and scandalous terms with the daughters of men than are\npermitted nowadays.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" replied Manuel, \"you may be right in a world wherein\nnothing is certain. At all events, I have deduced, from one to two\nthings in this torture-chamber, that it is better not to argue with King\nFerdinand.\"\n\n\"How can I help being right, when it was foretold long ago that such a\ndivine emissary as you would bring this very holy relic to turn me from\nmy sins and make a saint of me?\" says Ferdinand, peevishly.\n\n\"It appears to me a quite ordinary feather, King: but I recall what a\nmadman told me, and I do not dispute that your prophets are wiser than\nI, for I have been a divine emissary for only a short while.\"\n\n\"Do you name your price for this feather, then!\"\n\n\"I think it would be more respectful, sir, to refer you to the prophets,\nfor I find them generous and big-hearted creatures.\"\n\nFerdinand nodded his approval. \"That is very piously spoken, because it\nwas prophesied that this relic would be given me for no price at all by\na great nobleman. So I must forthwith write out for you a count's\ncommission, I suppose, and must write out your grants to fertile lands\nand a stout castle or two, and must date your title to these things from\nyesterday.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Manuel, \"it would not look well for you to be\nneglecting due respect to such a famous prophecy, with that bottle of\nink at your elbow.\"\n\nSo King Ferdinand sent for the Count of Poictesme, and explained to him\nas between old friends how the matter stood, and that afternoon the high\nCount was confessed and decapitated. Poictesme being now a vacant fief,\nKing Ferdinand ennobled Manuel, and made him Count of Poictesme.\n\nIt was true that all Poictesme was then held by the Northmen, under Duke\nAsmund, who denied King Ferdinand's authority with contempt, and\ndefeated him in battle with annoying persistence: so that Manuel for the\npresent acquired nothing but the sonorous title.\n\n\"Some terrible calamity, however,\" as King Ferdinand pointed out, \"is\nsure to befall Asmund and his iniquitous followers before very long, so\nwe need not bother about them.\"\n\n\"But how may I be certain of that, sir?\" Manuel asked.\n\n\"Count, I am surprised at such scepticism! Is it not very explicitly\nstated in Holy Writ that though the wicked may flourish for a while they\nare presently felled like green bay-trees?\"\n\n\"Yes, to be sure! So there is no doubt that your soldiers will soon\nconquer Duke Asmund.\"\n\n\"But I must not send any soldiers to fight against him, now that I am a\nsaint, for that would not look well. It would have an irreligious\nappearance of prompting Heaven.\"\n\n\"Still, King, you are sending soldiers against the Moors--\"\n\n\"Ah, but it is not your lands, Count, but my city of Ubeda, which the\nMoors are attacking, and to attack a saint, as you must undoubtedly\nunderstand, is a dangerous heresy which it is my duty to put down.\"\n\n\"Yes, to be sure! Well, well!\" says Manuel, \"at any rate, to be a count\nis something, and it is better to ward a fine name than a parcel of\npigs, though it appears the pigs are the more nourishing.\"\n\nIn the mean while the King's heralds rode everywhither in fluted armor,\nto proclaim the fulfilment of the old prophecy as to the Archangel\nOriphiel's feather. Never before was there such a hubbub in those parts,\nfor the bells of all the churches sounded all day, and all the people\nran about praying at the top of their voices, and forgiving their\nrelatives, and kissing the girls, and blowing whistles and ringing\ncowbells, because the city now harbored a relic so holy that the vilest\nsinner had but to touch it to be purified of iniquity.\n\nAnd that day King Ferdinand dismissed the evil companions with whom he\nhad so long rioted in every manner of wickedness, and Ferdinand lived\nhenceforward as became a saint. He builded two churches a year, and\nfared edifyingly on roots and herbs; he washed the feet of three\nindigent persons daily, and went in sackcloth; whenever he burned\nheretics he fetched and piled up the wood himself, so as to\ninconvenience nobody; and he made prioresses and abbesses of his more\nintimate and personal associates of yesterday, because he knew that\npeople are made holy by contact with holiness, and that sainthood is\nretroactive.\n\nThereafter Count Manuel abode for a month at the court of King\nFerdinand, noting whatever to this side and to that side seemed most\nnotable. Manuel was generally liked by the elect, and in the evening\nwhen the court assembled for family-prayers nobody was more devout than\nthe Count of Poictesme. He had a quiet way with the abbesses and\nprioresses, and with the anchorites and bishops a way of simplicity\nwhich was vastly admired in a divine emissary. \"But the particular favor\nof Heaven,\" as King Ferdinand pointed out, \"is always reserved for\nmodest persons.\"\n\nThe feather from the wing of Helmas' goose King Ferdinand had caused to\nbe affixed to the unassuming skullcap with a halo of gold wire which\nFerdinand now wore in the place of a vainglorious earthly crown; so that\nperpetual contiguity with this relic might keep him in augmenting\nsanctity. And now that doubt of himself had gone out of his mind,\nFerdinand lived untroubled, and his digestion improved on his light diet\nof roots and herbs, and his loving-kindness was infinite, because he\ncould not now be angry with the pitiable creatures haled before him,\nwhen he considered what lengthy and ingenious torments awaited every one\nof them, either in hell or purgatory, while Ferdinand would be playing a\ngold harp in heaven.\n\nSo Ferdinand dealt tenderly and generously with all. Half of his subjects\nsaid that simply showed you: and the rest of them assented that indeed\nyou might well say that, and they had often thought of it, and had wished\nthat young people would take profit by considering such things more\nseriously.\n\nAnd Manuel got clay and modeled a figure which had the features and the\nholy look of King Ferdinand.\n\n\"Yes, this young fellow you have made of mud is something like me,\" the\nKing conceded, \"although clay of course cannot do justice to the fine\nred cheeks and nose I used to have in the unregenerate days when I\nthought about such vanities, and, besides, it is rather more like you.\nStill, Count, the thing has feeling, it is wholesome, it is refreshingly\nfree from these modern morbid considerations of anatomy, and it does you\ncredit.\"\n\n\"No, King, I like this figure well enough, now that it is done, but it\nis not, I somehow know, the figure I desire to make. No, I must follow\nafter my own thinking and my own desires, and I do not need holiness.\"\n\n\"You artists!\" the King said. \"But there is more than mud upon your\nmind.\"\n\n\"In fact, I am puzzled, King, to see you made a saint of by its being\nexpected of you.\"\n\n\"But, Count, that ought to grieve nobody, so long as I do not complain,\nand it is of something graver you are thinking.\"\n\n\"I think, sir, that it is not right to rob anybody of anything, and I\nreflect that absolute righteousness is a fine feather in one's cap.\"\n\nThen Manuel went into the chicken-yard behind the red-roofed palace of\nKing Ferdinand, and caught a goose, and plucked from its wing a feather.\nThereafter the florid young Count of Poictesme rode east, on a tall\ndappled horse, and a retinue of six lackeys in silver and black liveries\ncame cantering after him, and the two foremost lackeys carried in\nknapsacks, marked with a gold coronet, the images which Dom Manuel had\nmade. A third lackey carried Dom Manuel's shield, upon which were\nemblazoned the arms of Poictesme. The black shield displayed a silver\nstallion which was rampant in every member and was bridled with gold,\nbut the ancient arms had been given a new motto.\n\n\"What means this Greek?\" Dom Manuel had asked.\n\n\"_Mundus decipit_, Count,\" they told him, \"is the old pious motto of\nPoictesme: it signifies that the affairs of this world are a vain\nfleeting show, and that terrestrial appearances are nowhere of any\nparticular importance.\"\n\n\"Then your motto is green inexperience,\" said Manuel, \"and for me to\nbear it would be black ingratitude.\"\n\nSo the writing had been changed in accordance with his instructions, and\nit now read _Mundus vult decipi_.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nThe Feather of Love\n\n\nIn such estate it was that Count Manuel came, on Christmas morning, just\ntwo days after Manuel was twenty-one, into Provence. This land, reputed\nsorcerous, in no way displayed to him any unusual features, though it\nwas noticeable that the King's marmoreal palace was fenced with silver\npikes whereon were set the embalmed heads of young men who had wooed the\nPrincess Alianora unsuccessfully. Manuel's lackeys did not at first like\nthe looks of these heads, and said they were unsuitable for Christmas\ndecorations: but Dom Manuel explained that at this season of general\nmerriment this palisade also was mirth-provoking because (the weather\nbeing such as was virtually unprecedented in these parts) a light snow\nhad fallen during the night, so that each head seemed to wear a\nnightcap.\n\nThey bring Manuel to Raymond B\u00e9renger, Count of Provence and King of\nAries, who was holding the Christmas feast in his warm hall. Raymond sat\non a fine throne of carved white ivory and gold, beneath a purple\ncanopy. And beside him, upon just such another throne, not quite so\nhigh, sat Raymond's daughter, Alianora the Unattainable Princess, in a\nrobe of watered silk which was of seven colors and was lined with the\ndark fur of barbiolets. In her crown were chrysolites and amethysts: it\nwas a wonder to note how brightly they shone, but they were not so\nbright as Alianora's eyes.\n\nShe stared as Manuel of the high head came through the hall, wherein the\nbarons were seated according to their degrees. She had, they say, four\nreasons for remembering the impudent, huge, squinting, yellow-haired\nyoung fellow whom she had encountered at the pool of Haranton. She\nblushed, and spoke with her father in the whistling and hissing language\nwhich the Apsarasas use among themselves: and her father laughed long\nand loud.\n\nSays Raymond B\u00e9renger: \"Things might have fallen out much worse. Come\ntell me now, Count of Poictesme, what is that I see in your breast\npocket wrapped in red silk?\"\n\n\"It is a feather, King,\" replied Manuel, a little wearily, \"wrapped in a\nbit of my sister's best petticoat.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay,\" says Raymond B\u00e9renger, with a grin that was becoming even more\nbenevolent, \"and I need not ask what price you come expecting for that\nfeather. None the less, you are an excellently spoken-of young wizard of\nnoble condition, who have slain no doubt a reasonable number of giants\nand dragons, and who have certainly turned kings from folly and\nwickedness. For such fine rumors speed before the man who has fine deeds\nbehind him that you do not come into my realm as a stranger: and, I\nrepeat, things might have fallen out much worse.\"\n\n\"Now listen, all ye that hold Christmas here!\" cried Manuel \"A while\nback I robbed this Princess of a feather, and the thought of it lay in\nmy mind more heavy than a feather, because I had taken what did not\nbelong to me. So a bond was on me, and I set out toward Provence to\nrestore to her a feather. And such happenings befell me by the way that\nat Michaelmas I brought wisdom into one realm, and at All-Hallows I\nbrought piety into another realm. Now what I may be bringing into this\nrealm of yours at Heaven's most holy season, Heaven only knows. To the\neye it may seem a quite ordinary feather. Yet life in the wide world, I\nfind, is a queerer thing than ever any swineherd dreamed of in his\nwattled hut, and people everywhere are nourished by their beliefs, in a\nway that the meat of pigs can nourish nobody.\"\n\nRaymond B\u00e9renger said, with a wise nod: \"I perceive what is in your\nheart, and I see likewise what is in your pocket. So why do you tell me\nwhat everybody knows? Everybody knows that the robe of the Apsarasas,\nwhich is the peculiar treasure of Provence, has been ruined by the loss\nof a feather, so that my daughter can no longer go abroad in the\nappearance of a swan, because the robe is not able to work any more\nwonders until that feather in your pocket has been sewed back into the\nrobe with the old incantation.\"\n\n\"Now, but indeed does everybody know that!\" says Manuel.\n\n\"--Everybody knows, too, that my daughter has pined away with fretting\nafter her lost ways of outdoor exercise, and the healthful changes of\nair which she used to be having. And finally, everybody knows that, at\nmy daughter's very sensible suggestion, I have offered my daughter's\nhand in marriage to him who would restore that feather, and death to\nevery impudent young fellow who dared enter here without it, as my\npalace fence attests.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" says Manuel, smiling, \"but seemingly it is no wholesome\nadventure which has come to me unsought!\"\n\n\"--So, as you tell me, you came into Provence: and, as there is no need\nto tell me, I hope, who have still two eyes in my head, you have\nachieved the adventure. And why do you keep telling me about matters\nwith which I am as well acquainted as you are?\"\n\n\"But, King of Arles, how do you know that this is not an ordinary\nfeather?\"\n\n\"Count of Poictesme, do people anywhere--?\"\n\n\"Oh, spare me that vile bit of worldly logic, sir, and I will concede\nwhatever you desire!\"\n\n\"Then do you stop talking such nonsense, and do you stop telling me\nabout things that everybody knows, and do you give my daughter her\nfeather!\"\n\nManuel ascends the white throne of Alianora. \"Queer things have befallen\nme,\" said Manuel, \"but nothing more strange than this can ever happen,\nthan that I should be standing here with you, and holding this small\nhand in mine. You are not perhaps quite so beautiful nor so clever as\nNiafer. Nevertheless, you are the Unattainable Princess, whose\nloveliness recalled me from vain grieving after Niafer, within a\nhalf-hour of Niafer's loss. Yes, you are she whose beauty kindled a\ndream and a dissatisfaction in the heart of a swineherd, to lead him\nforth into the wide world, and through the puzzling ways of the wide\nworld, and into its high places: so that at the last the swineherd is\nstanding--a-glitter in satin and gold and in rich furs,--here at the\nsummit of a throne; and at the last the hand of the Unattainable\nPrincess is in his hand, and in his heart is misery.\"\n\nThe Princess said, \"I do not know anything about this Niafer, who was\nprobably no better than she should have been, nor do I know of any\nconceivable reason for your being miserable.\"\n\n\"Why, is it not the truth,\" asks Manuel of Alianora, speaking not very\nsteadily, \"that you are to marry the man who restores the feather of\nwhich you were robbed at the pool of Haranton? and can marry none\nother?\"\n\n\"It is the truth,\" she answered, in a small frightened lovely voice,\n\"and I no longer grieve that it is the truth, and I think it a most\nimpolite reason for your being miserable.\"\n\nManuel laughed without ardor. \"See how we live and learn! I recall now\nthe droll credulity of a lad who watched a shining feather burned, while\nhe sat within arm's reach thinking about cabbage soup, because his grave\nelders assured him that a feather could never be of any use to anybody.\nAnd that, too, after he had seen what uses may be made of an old bridle\nor of a duck egg or of anything! Well, but all water that is past the\ndam must go its way, even though it be a flood of tears--\"\n\nHere Manuel gently shrugged broad shoulders. He took out of his pocket\nthe feather he had plucked from the wing of Ferdinand's goose.\n\nHe said: \"A feather I took from you in the red autumn woods, and a\nfeather I now restore to you, my Princess, in this white palace of\nyours, not asking any reward, and not claiming to be remembered by you\nin the gray years to come, but striving to leave no obligation\nundischarged and no debt unpaid. And whether in this world wherein\nnothing is certain, one feather is better than another feather, I do not\nknow. It well may come about that I must straightway take a foul doom\nfrom fair lips, and that presently my head will be drying on a silver\npike. Even so, one never knows: and I have learned that it is well to\nput all doubt of oneself quite out of mind.\"\n\nHe gave her the feather he had plucked from the third goose, and the\ntrumpets sounded as a token that the quest of Alianora's feather had\nbeen fulfilled, and all the courtiers shouted in honor of Count Manuel.\n\nAlianora looked at what was in her hand, and saw it was a goose-feather,\nin nothing resembling the feather which, when she had fled in maidenly\nembarrassment from Manuel's over-friendly advances, she had plucked from\nthe robe of the Apsarasas, and had dropped at Manuel's feet, in order\nthat her father might be forced to proclaim this quest, and the winning\nof it might be predetermined.\n\nThen Alianora looked at Manuel. Now before her the queer unequal eyes of\nthis big young man were bright and steadfast as altar candles. His chin\nwas well up, and it seemed to her that this fine young fellow expected\nher to declare the truth, when the truth would be his death-sentence.\nShe had no patience with his nonsense.\n\nSays Alianora, with that lovely tranquil smile of hers: \"Count Manuel\nhas fulfilled the quest. He has restored to me the feather from the robe\nof the Apsarasas. I recognize it perfectly.\"\n\n\"Why, to be sure,\" says Raymond B\u00e9renger. \"Still, do you get your needle\nand the recipe for the old incantation, and the robe too, and make it\nplain to all my barons that the power of the robe is returned to it, by\nflying about the hall a little in the appearance of a swan. For it is\nbetter to conduct these affairs in due order and without any suspicion\nof irregularity.\"\n\nNow matters looked ticklish for Dom Manuel, since he and Alianora knew\nthat the robe had been spoiled, and that the addition of any number of\ngoose-feathers was not going to turn Alianora into a swan. Yet the boy's\nhandsome and high-colored face stayed courteously attentive to the\nwishes of his host, and did not change.\n\nBut Alianora said indignantly: \"My father, I am surprised at you! Have\nyou no sense of decency at all? You ought to know it is not becoming for\nan engaged girl to be flying about Provence in the appearance of a swan,\nfar less among a parcel of men who have been drinking all morning. It is\nthe sort of thing that leads to a girl's being talked about.\"\n\n\"Now, that is true, my dear,\" said Raymond B\u00e9renger, abashed, \"and the\nsentiment does you credit. So perhaps I had better suggest something\nelse--\"\n\n\"Indeed, my father, I see exactly what you would be suggesting. And I\nbelieve you are right.\"\n\n\"I am not infallible, my dear: but still--\"\n\n\"Yes, you are perfectly right: it is not well for any married woman to\nbe known to possess any such robe. There is no telling, just as you say,\nwhat people would be whispering about her, nor what disgraceful tricks\nshe would get the credit of playing on her husband.\"\n\n\"My daughter, I was only about to tell you--\"\n\n\"Yes, and you put it quite unanswerably. For you, who have the name of\nbeing the wisest Count that ever reigned in Provence, and the shrewdest\nKing that Arles has ever had, know perfectly well how people talk, and\nhow eager people are to talk, and to place the very worst construction\non everything: and you know, too, that husbands do not like such talk.\nCertainly I had not thought of these things, my father, but I believe\nthat you are right.\"\n\nRaymond B\u00e9renger stroked his thick short beard, and said: \"Now truly, my\ndaughter, whether or not I be wise and shrewd--though, as you say, of\ncourse there have been persons kind enough to consider--and in petitions\ntoo--However, be that as it may, and putting aside the fact that\neverybody likes to be appreciated, I must confess I can imagine no gift\nwhich would at this high season be more acceptable to any husband than\nthe ashes of that robe.\"\n\n\"This is a saying,\" Alianora here declares, \"well worthy of Raymond\nB\u00e9renger: and I have often wondered at your striking way of putting\nthings.\"\n\n\"That, too, is a gift,\" the King-Count said, with proper modesty, \"which\nto some persons is given, and to others not: so I deserve no credit for\nit. But, as I was saying when you interrupted me, my dear, it is well\nfor youth to have its fling, because (as I have often thought) we are\nyoung only once: and so I have not ever criticized your jauntings in far\nlands. But a husband is another pair of sandals. A husband does not like\nto have his wife flying about the tree tops and the tall lonely\nmountains and the low long marshes, with nobody to keep an eye on her,\nand that is the truth of it. So, were I in your place, and wise enough\nto listen to the old father who loves you, and who is wiser than you, my\ndear--why, now that you are about to marry, I repeat to you with all\npossible earnestness, my darling, I would destroy this feather and this\nrobe in one red fire, if only Count Manuel will agree to it. For it is\nhe who now has power over all your possessions, and not I.\"\n\n\"Count Manuel,\" says Alianora, with that lovely tranquil smile of hers,\n\"you perceive that my father is insistent, and it is my duty to be\nguided by him. I do not deny that, upon my father's advice, I am asking\nyou to let perish a strong magic which many persons would value above a\nwoman's pleading. But I know now\"--her eyes met his, and to any young\nman anywhere with a heart moving in him, that which Manuel could see in\nthe bright frightened eyes of Alianora could not but be a joy well-nigh\nintolerable,--\"but I know now that you, who are to be my husband, and\nwho have brought wisdom into one kingdom, and piety into another, have\nbrought love into the third kingdom: and I perceive that this third\nmagic is a stronger and a nobler magic than that of the Apsarasas. And\nit seems to me that you and I would do well to dispense with anything\nwhich is second rate.\"\n\n\"I am of the opinion that you are a singularly intelligent young woman,\"\nsays Manuel, \"and I am of the belief that it is far too early for me to\nbe crossing my wife's wishes, in a world wherein all men are nourished\nby their beliefs.\"\n\nAll being agreed, the Yule-log was stirred up into a blaze, which was\nduly fed with the goose-feather and the robe of the Apsarasas.\nThereafter the trumpets sounded a fanfare, to proclaim that Raymond\nB\u00e9renger's collops were cooked and peppered, his wine casks broached,\nand his puddings steaming. Then the former swineherd went in to share\nhis Christmas dinner with the King-Count's daughter, Alianora, whom\npeople everywhere had called the Unattainable Princess.\n\nAnd they relate that while Alianora and Manuel sat cosily in the hood of\nthe fireplace and cracked walnuts, and in the pauses of their talking\nnoted how the snow was drifting by the windows, the ghost of Niafer went\nrestlessly about green fields beneath an ever radiant sky in the\nparadise of the pagans. When the kindly great-browed warders asked her\nwhat it was she was seeking, the troubled spirit could not tell them,\nfor Niafer had tasted Lethe, and had forgotten Dom Manuel. Only her love\nfor him had not been forgotten, because that love had become a part of\nher, and so lived on as a blind longing and as a desire which did not\nknow its aim. And they relate also that in Suskind's low red-pillared\npalace Suskind waited with an old thought for company.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nPART TWO\n\n\nTHE BOOK OF SPENDING\n\n\nTO\n\nLOUIS UNTERMEYER\n\n\n\nOften _tymes herde Manuel tell of the fayrness of this Queene of _Furies\n_and_ Gobblins _and_ Hydraes, _insomuch that he was enamoured of hyr,\nthough he neuer sawe hyr: then by this Connynge made he a Hole in the\nfyer, and went ouer to hyr, and when he had spoke with hyr, he shewed\nhyr his mynde._\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nAlianora\n\n\nThey of Poictesme narrate that after dinner King Raymond sent messengers\nto his wife, who was spending that Christmas with their daughter, Queen\nMeregrett of France, to bid Dame Beatrice return as soon as might be\nconvenient, so that they might marry off their daughter Alianora to the\nfamous Count Manuel. They tell also how the holiday season passed with\nevery manner of festivity, and how Dom Manuel got on splendidly with his\nPrincess, and how it appeared to onlookers that for both of them, even\nfor the vaguely condescending boy, love-making proved a very marvelous\nand dear pursuit.\n\nDom Manuel confessed, in reply to jealous questionings, that he did not\nthink Alianora quite so beautiful nor so clever as Niafer had been, but\nthis, as Manuel pointed out, was hardly a matter which could be\nremedied. At all events, the Princess was a fine-looking and intelligent\ngirl, as Dom Manuel freely conceded to her: and the magic of the\nApsarasas, in which she was instructing him, Dom Manuel declared to be\nvery interesting if you cared for that sort of thing.\n\nThe Princess humbly admitted, in reply, that of course her magic did not\ncompare with his, since hers was powerful only over the bodies of men\nand beasts, whereas Dom Manuel's magic had so notably controlled the\nhearts and minds of kings. Still, as Alianora pointed out, she could\nblight corn and cattle, and raise tempests very handily, and, given\ntime, could smite an enemy with almost any physical malady you selected.\nShe could not kill outright, to be sure, but even so, these lesser\nmischiefs were not despicable accomplishments in a young girl. Anyhow,\nshe said in peroration, it was atrocious to discourage her by laughing\nat the best she could do.\n\n\"Ah, but come now, my dear,\" says Manuel, \"I was only teasing. I really\nthink your work most promising. You have but to continue. Practise, that\nis the thing, they say, in all the arts.\"\n\n\"Yes, and with you to help me--\"\n\n\"No, I have graver matters to attend to than devil-mongering,\" says\nManuel, \"and a bond to lift from myself before I can lay miseries on\nothers.\"\n\nFor because of the geas that was on him to make a figure in the world,\nDom Manuel had unpacked his two images, and after vexedly considering\nthem, he had fallen again to modeling in clay, and had made a third\nimage. This image also was in the likeness of a young man, but it had\nthe fine proud features and the loving look of Alianora.\n\nManuel confessed to being fairly well pleased with this figure, but even\nso, he did not quite recognize in it the figure he desired to make, and\ntherefore, he said, he deduced that love was not the thing which was\nessential to him.\n\nAlianora did not like the image at all.\n\n\"To have made an image of me,\" she considered, \"would have been a very\npretty compliment. But when it comes to pulling about my features, as if\nthey did not satisfy you, and mixing them up with your features, until\nyou have made the appearance of a young man that looks like both of us,\nit is not a compliment. Instead, it is the next thing but one to\negotism.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, now I think of it, I am an egotist. At all events, I am\nManuel.\"\n\n\"Nor, dearest,\" says she, \"is it quite befitting that you, who are now\nbetrothed to a princess, and who are going to be Lord of Provence and\nKing of Arles, as soon as I can get rid of Father, should be always\nmessing with wet mud.\"\n\n\"I know that very well,\" Manuel replied, \"but, none the less, a geas is\non me to honor my mother's wishes, and to make an admirable and\nsignificant figure in the world. Apart from that, though, Alianora, I\nrepeat to you, this scheme of yours, about poisoning your father as soon\nas we are married, appears to me for various reasons ill-advised. I am\nin no haste to be King of Arles, and, in fact, I am not sure that I wish\nto be king at all, because my geas is more important.\"\n\n\"Sweetheart, I love you very much, but my love does not blind me to the\nfact that, no matter, what your talents at sorcery, you are in everyday\nmatters a hopelessly unpractical person. Do you leave this affair to me,\nand I will manage it with every regard to appearances.\"\n\n\"Ah, and does one have to preserve appearances even in such matters as\nparricide?\"\n\n\"But certainly it looks much better for Father to be supposed to die of\nindigestion. People would be suspecting all sorts of evil of the poor\ndear if it were known that his own daughter could not put up with him.\nIn any event, sweetheart, I am resolved that, since very luckily Father\nhas no sons, you shall be King of Arles before this new year is out.\"\n\n\"No, I am Manuel: and it means more to me to be Manuel than to be King\nof Arles, and Count of Provence, and seneschal of Aix and Brignoles and\nGrasse and Massilia and Draguignan and so on.\"\n\n\"Oh, you are breaking my heart with this neglect of your true interests!\nAnd it is all the doing of these three vile images, which you value more\nthan the old throne of Boson and Rothbold, and oceans more than you do\nme!\"\n\n\"Come, I did not say that.\"\n\n\"Yes, and you think, too, a deal more about that dead heathen servant\ngirl than you do about me, who am a princess and the heir to a kingdom.\"\n\nManuel looked at Alianora for a considerable while, before speaking. \"My\ndear, you are, as I have always told you, an unusually fine looking and\nintelligent girl. And yes, you are a princess, of course, though you are\nno longer the Unattainable Princess: that makes a difference\ncertainly--But, over and above all this, there was never anybody like\nNiafer, and it would be nonsense to pretend otherwise.\"\n\nThe Princess said: \"I wonder at myself. You are schooled in strange\nsorceries unknown to the Apsarasas, there is no questioning that, after\nthe miracles you wrought with Helmas and Ferdinand: even so, I too have\na neat hand at magic, and it is not right for you to be treating me as\nthough I were the dirt under your feet. And I endure it! It is that\nwhich puzzles me, it makes me wonder at myself, and my sole comfort is\nthat, at any rate, this wonderful Niafer of yours is dead and done\nwith.\"\n\nManuel sighed. \"Yes, Niafer is dead, and these images also are dead\nthings, and both these facts continually trouble me. Nothing can be done\nabout Niafer, I suppose, but if only I could give some animation to\nthese images I think the geas upon me would be satisfied.\"\n\n\"Such a desire is blasphemous, Manuel, for the Eternal Father did no\nmore than that with His primal sculptures in Eden.\"\n\nDom Manuel blinked his vivid blue eyes as if in consideration. \"Well,\nbut,\" he said, gravely, \"but if I am a child of God it is only natural,\nI think, that I should inherit the tastes and habits of my Father. No,\nit is not blasphemous, I think, to desire to make an animated and lively\nfigure, somewhat more admirable and significant than that of the average\nman. No, I think not. Anyhow, blasphemous or not, that is my need, and I\nmust follow after my own thinking and my own desire.\"\n\n\"If that desire were satisfied,\" asks Alianora, rather queerly, \"would\nyou be content to settle down to some such rational method of living as\nbecomes a reputable sorcerer and king?\"\n\n\"I think so, for a king has no master, and he is at liberty to travel\neverywhither, and to see the ends of this world and judge them. Yes, I\nthink so, in a world wherein nothing is certain.\"\n\n\"If I but half way believed that, I would endeavor to obtain Schamir.\"\n\n\"And what in the devil is this Schamir?\"\n\n\"A slip of the tongue,\" replied Alianora, smiling. \"No, I shall have\nnothing to do with your idiotic mud figures, and I shall tell you\nnothing further.\"\n\n\"Come now, pettikins!\" says Manuel. And he began coaxing the Princess of\nProvence with just such cajoleries as the big handsome boy had formerly\nexercised against the peasant girls of Rathgor.\n\n\"Schamir,\" said Alianora, at last, \"is set in a signet ring which is\nvery well known in the country on the other side of the fire. Schamir\nhas the appearance of a black pebble; and if, after performing the proper\nceremonies, you were to touch one of these figures with it the figure\nwould become animated.\"\n\n\"Well, but,\" says Manuel, \"the difficulty is that if I attempt to pass\nthrough the fire in order to reach the country behind it, I shall be\nburned to a cinder, and so I have no way of obtaining this talisman.\"\n\n\"In order to obtain it,\" Alianora told him, \"one must hard-boil an egg\nfrom the falcon's nest, then replace it in the nest, and secrete oneself\nnear by with a crossbow, under a red and white umbrella, until the\nmother bird, finding one of her eggs resists all her endeavors to infuse\nwarmth into it, flies off, and plunges into the nearest fire, and\nreturns with this ring in her beak. With Schamir she will touch the\nboiled egg, and so restore the egg to its former condition. At that\nmoment she must be shot, and the ring must be secured, before the falcon\ncan return the talisman to its owner. I mean, to its dreadful owner, who\nis\"--here Alianora made an incomprehensible sign,--\"who is Queen Freydis\nof Audela.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Manuel, \"what is the good of my knowing this in the dead of\nwinter! It will be months before the falcons are nesting again.\"\n\n\"Manuel, Manuel, there is no understanding you! Do you not see how badly\nit looks for a grown man, and far more for a famed champion and a potent\nsorcerer, to be pouting and scowling and kicking your heels about like\nthat, and having no patience at all?\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose it does look badly, but I am Manuel, and I follow--\"\n\n\"Oh, spare me that,\" cried Alianora, \"or else, no matter how much I may\nlove you, dearest, I shall box your jaws!\"\n\n\"None the less, what I was going to say is true,\" declared Manuel, \"and\nif only you would believe it, matters would go more smoothly between\nus.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nMagic of the Apsarasas\n\n\nNow the tale tells how, to humor Alianora, Count Manuel applied himself\nto the magic of the Apsarasas. He went with the Princess to a high\nsecret place, and Alianora, crying sweetly, in the famous old fashion,\n\"Torolix, Ciccabau, Tio, Tio, Torolililix!\" performed the proper\nincantations, and forthwith birds came multitudinously from all quarters\nof the sky, in a descending flood of color and flapping and whistling\nand screeching.\n\nThe peacock screamed, \"With what measure thou judgest others, thou shalt\nthyself be judged.\"\n\nSang the nightingale, \"Contentment is the greatest happiness.\"\n\nThe turtle-dove called, \"It were better for some created things that\nthey had never been created.\"\n\nThe peewit chirped, \"He that hath no mercy for others, shall find none\nfor himself.\"\n\nThe stork said huskily, \"The fashion of this world passeth away.\"\n\nAnd the wail of the eagle was, \"Howsoever long life may be, yet its\ninevitable term is death.\"\n\n\"Now that is virtually what I said,\" declared the stork, \"and you are a\nbold-faced and bald-headed plagiarist.\"\n\n\"And you,\" replied the eagle, clutching the stork's throat, \"are a dead\nbird that will deliver no more babies.\"\n\nBut Dom Manuel tugged at the eagle's wing, and asked him if he really\nmeant that to hold good before this Court of the Birds. And when the\ninfuriated eagle opened his cruel beak, and held up one murderous claw,\nto make solemn oath that indeed he did mean it, and would show them too,\nthe stork very intelligently flew away.\n\n\"I shall not ever forget your kindness, Count Manuel,\" cried the stork,\n\"and do you remember that the customary three wishes are always yours\nfor the asking.\"\n\n\"And I too am grateful,\" said the abashed eagle,--\"yes, upon the whole,\nI am grateful, for if I had killed that long-legged pest it would have\nbeen in contempt of the court, and they would have set me to hatching\nred cockatrices. Still, his reproach was not unfounded, and I must think\nup a new cry.\"\n\nSo the eagle perched on a rock, and said tentatively, \"There is such a\nthing as being too proud to fight.\" He shook his bald head disgustedly,\nand tried, \"The only enduring peace is a peace without victory,\" but\nthat did not seem to content him either. Afterward he cried out, \"All\npersons who oppose me have pygmy minds,\" and \"If everybody does not do\nexactly as I order, the heart of the world will be broken\": and many\nother foolish things he repeated, and shook his head over, for none of\nthese axioms pleased the eagle, and he no longer admired the pedagogue\nwho had invented them.\n\nSo in his worried quest for a saying sufficiently orotund and\nmeaningless to content his ethics, and to be hailed with convenience as\na great moral principle, the eagle forgot all about Count Manuel: but\nthe stork did not forget, because in the eyes of the stork the life of\nthe stork is valuable.\n\nThe other birds uttered various such sentiments as have been recorded,\nand all these, they told Manuel, were accredited sorceries. The big\nyellow-haired boy did not dispute it, he rarely disputed anything: but\nthe droop to that curious left eye of his was accentuated, and he\nadmitted to Alianora that he wondered if such faint-hearted smug little\ntruths were indeed the height of wisdom, outside of religion and public\nspeaking. Then he asked which was the wisest of the birds, and they told\nhim the Zhar-Ptitza, whom others called the Fire-Bird.\n\nManuel induced Alianora to summon the Zhar-Ptitza, who is the oldest and\nthe most learned of all living creatures, although he has thus far\nlearned nothing assuredly except that appearances have to be kept up.\nThe Zhar-Ptitza came, crying wearily, \"Fine feathers make fine birds.\"\nYou heard him from afar.\n\nThe Zhar-Ptitza himself had every reason to get comfort out of this\naxiom, for his plumage was everywhere the most brilliant purple, except\nthat his neck feathers were the color of new gold, and his tail was blue\nwith somewhat longer red feathers intermingled. His throat was wattled\ngorgeously, and his head was tufted, and he seemed a trifle larger than\nthe eagle. The Fire-Bird brought with him his nest of cassia and sprigs\nof incense, and this he put down upon the lichened rocks, and he sat in\nit while he talked with Manuel.\n\nThe frivolous question that Manuel raised as to his clay figures, the\nZhar-Ptitza considered a very human bit of nonsense: and the wise\ncreature said he felt forced to point out that no intelligent bird would\never dream of making images.\n\n[Illustration: HE WAS DRYING OUT IN THE SUN]\n\n\"But, sir,\" said Manuel, \"I do not wish to burden this world with any\nmore lifeless images. Instead, I wish to make in this world an animated\nfigure, very much as, they say, a god did once upon a time--\"\n\n\"Come, you should not try to put too much responsibility upon Jahveh,\"\nprotested the Zhar-Ptitza, tolerantly, \"for Jahveh made only one man,\nand did not ever do it again. I remember the making of that first man\nvery clearly, for I was created the morning before, with instructions to\nfly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven, so I saw the whole\naffair. Yes, Jahveh did create the first man on the sixth day. And I\nvoiced no criticism. For of course after working continuously for nearly\na whole week, and making so many really important things, no creative\nartist should be blamed for not being in his happiest vein on the sixth\nday.\"\n\n\"And did you happen to notice, sir,\" asks Manuel, hopefully, \"by what\nmethod animation was given to Adam?\"\n\n\"No, he was drying out in the sun when I first saw him, with Gabriel\nsitting at his feet, playing on a flageolet: and naturally I did not pay\nany particular attention to such foolishness.\"\n\n\"Well, well, I do not assert that the making of men is the highest form\nof art, yet, none the less, a geas is upon me to make myself a very\nsplendid and admirable young man.\"\n\n\"But why should you be wasting your small portion of breath and\nstrength? To what permanent use could one put a human being even if the\ncreature were virtuous and handsome to look at? Ah, Manuel, you have not\nseen them pass, as I have seen them pass in swarms, with their wars and\ntheir reforms and their great causes, and leaving nothing but their\nbones behind them.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, to you, at your age, who were old when Nineveh was planned,\nit must seem strange; and I do not know why my mother desired that I\nshould make myself a splendid and admirable young man. But the geas is\nupon me.\"\n\nThe Zhar-Ptitza sighed. \"Certainly these feminine whims are not easily\nexplained. Yet your people have some way of making brand-new men and\nwomen of all kinds. I am sure of this, for otherwise the race would have\nbeen extinct a great while since at the rate they kill one another. And\nperhaps they do adhere to Jahveh's method, and make fresh human beings\nout of earth, for, now I think of it, I have seen the small, recently\ncompleted ones, who looked exactly like red clay.\"\n\n\"It is undeniable that babies do have something of that look,\" assented\nManuel. \"So then, at least, you think I may be working in the proper\nmedium?\"\n\n\"It seems plausible, because I am certain your people are not\nintelligent enough to lay eggs, nor could, of course, such an impatient\nrace succeed in getting eggs hatched. At all events, they have\nundoubtedly contrived some method or other, and you might find out from\nthe least foolish of them about that method.\"\n\n\"Who, then, is the least foolish of mankind?\"\n\n\"Probably King Helmas of Albania, for it was prophesied by me a great\nwhile ago that he would become the wisest of men if ever he could come\nby one of my shining white feathers, and I hear it reported he has done\nso.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Manuel, dubiously, \"I must tell you in confidence that\nthe feather King Helmas has is not yours, but was plucked from the wing\nof an ordinary goose.\"\n\n\"Does that matter?\" asked the Zhar-Ptitza. \"I never prophesied, of\ncourse, that he actually would find one of my shining white feathers,\nbecause all my feathers are red and gold and purple.\"\n\n\"But how can there be any magic in a goose-feather?\"\n\n\"There is this magic, that, possessing it, King Helmas has faith in, and\nhas stopped bothering about, himself.\"\n\n\"Is not to bother about yourself the highest wisdom?\"\n\n\"Oh, no! Oh, dear me, no! I merely said it is the highest of which man\nis capable.\"\n\n\"But the sages and philosophers, sir, that had such fame in the old\ntime, and made the maxims for you birds! Why, did King Solomon, for\nexample, rise no higher than that?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, to be sure!\" said the Zhar-Ptitza, sighing again, \"now that\nwas a sad error. The poor fellow was endowed with, just as an\nexperiment, considerable wisdom. And it caused him to perceive that a\nman attains to actual contentment only when he is drunk or when he is\nengaged in occupations not very decorously described. So\nSulieman-ben-Daoud gave over all the rest of his time to riotous living\nand to co-educational enterprises. It was logic, but it led to a most\nexpensive seraglio and to a very unbecoming appearance, and virtually\nwrecked the man's health. Yes, that was the upshot of one of you being\nendowed with actual wisdom, just as an experiment, to see what would\ncome of it: so the experiment, of course, has never been repeated. But\nof living persons, I dare assert that you will find King Helmas\nappreciably freed from a thousand general delusions by his one delusion\nabout himself.\"\n\n\"Very well, then,\" says Manuel. \"I suspect a wilful paradox and a forced\ncynicism in much of what you have said, but I shall consult with King\nHelmas about human life and about the figure I have to make in the\nworld.\"\n\nSo they bid each other farewell, and the Zhar-Ptitza picked up his nest\nof cassia and sprigs of incense, and flew away with it: and as he rose\nin the air the Zhar-Ptitza cried, \"Fine feathers make fine birds.\"\n\n\"But that is not the true proverb, sir,\" Manuel called up toward the\nresplendent creature, \"and such perversions too, they tell me, are a\nmark of would-be cleverness.\"\n\n\"So it may seem to you now, my lad, but time is a very transforming\nfairy. Therefore do you wait until you are older,\" the bird replied,\nfrom on high, \"and then you will know better than to doubt my cry or to\nrepeat it.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nIce and Iron\n\n\nThen came from oversea the Bishops of Ely and Lincoln, the prior of\nHurle, and the Master of the Temple, asking that King Raymond send one\nof his daughters, with a suitable dowry, to be the King of England's\nwife. \"Very willingly,\" says Raymond B\u00e9renger; and told them they could\nhave his third daughter Sancha, with a thousand marks.\n\n\"But, Father,\" said Alianora, \"Sancha is nothing but a child. A fine\nqueen she would make!\"\n\n\"Still, my dear,\" replied King Raymond, \"you are already bespoke.\"\n\n\"I was not thinking about myself. I was thinking about Sancha's true\nwelfare.\"\n\n\"Of course you were, my dear, and everybody knows the sisterly love you\nhave for her.\"\n\n\"The pert little mess is spoilt enough as it is, Heaven knows. And if\nthings came to the pass that I had to stand up whenever Sancha came into\nthe room, and to sit on a footstool while she lolled back in a chair the\nway Meregrett does, it would be the child's ruin.\"\n\nRaymond B\u00e9renger said: \"Now certainly it will be hard on you to have two\nsisters that are queens, and with perhaps little Beatrice also marrying\nsome king or another when her time comes, and you staying only a\ncountess, who are the best-looking of the lot.\"\n\n\"My father, I see what you would be at!\" cried Alianora, aghast. \"You\nthink it is my duty to overcome my private inclinations, and to marry\nthe King of England for ruthless and urgent political reasons!\"\n\n\"I only said, my darling--\"\n\n\"--For you have seen at once that I owe this great sacrifice to the\nfuture welfare of our beloved Provence. You have noted, with that\nkeenness which nothing escapes, that with the aid of your wisdom and\nadvice I would know very well how to manage this high King that is the\nmaster of no pocket handkerchief place like Provence but of England and\nof Ireland too.\"\n\n\"Also, by rights, of Aquitaine and Anjou and Normandy, my precious.\nStill, I merely observed--\"\n\n\"Oh, but believe me, I am not arguing with you, my dear father, for I\nknow that you are much wiser than I,\" says Alianora, bravely wiping away\nbig tears from her lovely eyes.\n\n\"Have it your own way, then,\" replied Raymond B\u00e9renger, with outspread\nhands. \"But what is to be done about you and Count Manuel here?\"\n\nThe King looked toward the tapestry of Jephthah's sacrifice, beside\nwhich Manuel sat, just then re-altering the figure of the young man with\nthe loving look of Alianora that Manuel had made because of the urgency\nof his geas, and could not seem to get exactly right.\n\n\"I am sure, Father, that Manuel also will be self-sacrificing and\nmagnanimous and sensible about it.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes! but what is to happen afterward? For anyone can see that you\nand this squinting long-legged lad are fathoms deep in love with each\nother.\"\n\n\"I think that after I am married, Father, you or King Ferdinand or King\nHelmas can send Count Manuel into England on some embassy, and I am sure\nthat he and I will always be true and dear friends without affording any\nhandle to gossip.\"\n\n\"Oho!\" King Raymond said, \"I perceive your drift, and it is toward a\nharbor that is the King of England's affair, and not mine. My part is to\ngo away now, so that you two may settle the details of that\nambassadorship in which Dom Manuel is to be the vicar of so many kings.\"\n\nRaymond B\u00e9renger took up his sceptre and departed, and the Princess\nturned to where Manuel was pottering with the three images he had made\nin the likeness of Helmas and Ferdinand and Alianora. \"You see, now,\nManuel dearest, I am heart-broken, but for the realm's sake I must marry\nthe King of England.\"\n\nManuel looked up from his work. \"Yes, I heard. I am sorry, and I never\nunderstood politics, but I suppose it cannot be helped. So would you\nmind standing a little more to the left? You are in the light now, and\nthat prevents my seeing clearly what I am doing here to this upper lip.\"\n\n\"And how can you be messing with that wet mud when my heart is\nbreaking!\"\n\n\"Because a geas is upon me to make these images. No, I am sure I do not\nknow why my mother desired it. But everything which is fated must be\nendured, just as we must now endure the obligation that is upon you to\nmarry the high King of England.\"\n\n\"My being married need not matter very much, after I am Queen, for\npeople declare this King is a poor spindling creature, and, as I was\nsaying, you can come presently into England.\"\n\nManuel looked at her for a moment or two. She colored. He, sitting at\nthe feet of weeping Jephthah, smiled. \"Well,\" said Manuel, \"I will come\ninto England when you send me a goose-feather. So the affair is arranged.\"\n\n\"Oh, you are all ice and iron!\" she said, \"and you care for nothing\nexcept your wet mud images, and I detest you!\"\n\n\"My dearest,\" Manuel answered placidly, \"the trouble is that each of us\ndesires one particular thing over and above other things. Your desire is\nfor power and a great name and for a king who will be at once your\nmouthpiece, your lackey and your lover. Now, candidly, I cannot spare\nthe time to be any of these things, because my desire is different from\nyour desire, but is equally strong. Also, it seems to me, as I become\nolder, and see more of men and of men's ways, that most people have no\nespecial desire but only preferences. In a world of such wishy-washy\nfolk you and I cannot hope to escape being aspersed with comparisons to\nice and iron, but it does not become us to be flinging these venerable\nsimiles in each other's faces.\"\n\nShe kept silence a while. She laughed uneasily. \"I so often wonder about\nyou, Manuel, as to whether inside the big, high-colored, squinting,\nsolemn husk is living a very wise person or a very unmitigated fool.\"\n\n\"I perceive there is something else which we have in common, for I, too,\noften wonder about that.\"\n\n\"It is settled, then?\"\n\n\"It is settled that, instead of ruling little Arles, you are to be Queen\nof England, and Lady of Ireland, and Duchess of Normandy and Aquitaine,\nand Countess of Anjou; that our token is to be a goose-feather; and\nthat, I diffidently repeat, you are to get out of my light and interfere\nno longer with the discharge of my geas.\"\n\n\"And what will you do?\"\n\n\"I must, as always, follow after my own thinking--\"\n\n\"If you complete the sentence I shall undoubtedly scream.\"\n\nManuel laughed good-humoredly. \"I suppose I do say it rather often, but\nthen it is true, and the great trouble between us, Alianora, is that you\ndo not perceive its truth.\"\n\nShe said, \"And I suppose you will now be stalking off to some woman or\nanother for consolation?\"\n\n\"No, the consolation I desire is not to be found in petticoats. No,\nfirst of all, I shall go to King Helmas. For my images stay obstinately\nlifeless, and there is something lacking to each of them, and none is\nthe figure I desire to make in this world. Now I do not know what can be\ndone about it, but the Zhar-Ptitza informs me that King Helmas, since\nall doubt of himself has been put out of mind, can aid me if any man\ncan.\"\n\n\"Then we must say good-bye, though not for a long while, I hope.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Manuel said, \"this is good-bye, and to a part of my living it is\nan eternal good-bye.\"\n\nDom Manuel left his images where the old Hebrew captain appeared to\nregard them with violent dumb anguish, and Manuel took both of the\ngirl's lovely little hands, and he stood thus for a while looking down\nat the Princess.\n\nSaid Manuel, very sadly:\n\n\"I cry the elegy of such notions as are possible to boys alone.\n'Surely,' I said, 'the informing and all-perfect soul shines through and\nis revealed in this beautiful body.' So my worship began for you, whose\nviolet eyes retain at all times their chill brittle shining, and do not\nsoften, but have been to me always as those eyes which, they say, a\ngoddess turns toward ruined lovers who cry the elegy of hope and\ncontentment, with lips burned bloodless by the searing of passions which\nshe, immortal, may neither feel nor comprehend. Even so do you, dear\nAlianora, who are not divine, look toward me, quite unmoved by anything\nexcept incurious wonder, the while that I cry my elegy.\n\n\"I, for love, and for the glamour of bright beguiling dreams that hover\nand delude and allure all lovers, could never until to-day behold\nclearly what person I was pestering with my notions. I, being blind,\ncould not perceive your blindness which blindly strove to understand me,\nand which hungered for understanding, as I for love. Thus our kisses\nveiled, at most, the foiled endeavorings of flesh that willingly would\nenter into the soul's high places, but is not able. Now, the game being\nover, what is the issue and end of it time must attest. At least we\nshould each sorrow a little for what we have lost in this gaming,--you\nfor a lover, and I for love.\n\n\"No, but it is not love which lies here expiring, now we part friendlily\nat the deathbed of that emotion which yesterday we shared. This emotion\nalso was not divine; and so might not outlive the gainless months\nwherein, like one fishing for pearls in a millpond, I have toiled to\nevoke from your heart more than Heaven placed in this heart, wherein\nlies no love. Now the crying is stilled that was the crying of\nloneliness to its unfound mate: already dust is gathering light and gray\nupon the unmoving lips. Therefore let us bury our dead, and having\nplaced the body in the tomb, let us honestly inscribe above this\nfragile, flower-like perished emotion, 'Here lieth lust, not love.'\"\n\nNow Alianora pouted. \"You use such very ugly words, sweetheart: and you\nare talking unreasonably, too, for I am sure I am just as sorry about it\nas you are--\"\n\nManuel gave her that slow sleepy smile which was Manuel. \"Just,\" he\nsaid,--\"and it is that which humiliates. Yes, you and I are second-rate\npersons, Alianora, and we have found each other out. It is a pity. But\nwe will always keep our secret from the rest of the world, and our\nsecret will always be a bond between us.\"\n\nHe kissed the Princess, very tenderly, and so left her.\n\nThen Manuel of the high head departed from Aries, with his lackeys and\nhis images, riding in full estate, and displaying to the spring sunlight\nthe rearing silver stallion upon his shield and the _motto Mundus vult\ndecipi_. Alianora, watching from the castle window, wept copiously,\nbecause the poor Princess had the misfortune to be really in love with\nDom Manuel. But there was no doing anything with his obstinacy and his\nincomprehensible notions, Alianora had found, and so she set about\ndisposing of herself and of the future through more plastic means. Her\nmethods were altered perforce, but her aim remained unchanged: and she\nstill intended to get everything she desired (which included Manuel) as\nsoon as she and the King of England had settled down to some sensible\nway of living.\n\nIt worried this young pretty girl to consult her mirror, and to foreknow\nthat the King of England would probably be in love with her for months\nand months: but then, as she philosophically reflected, all women have\nto submit to being annoyed by the romanticism of men. So she dried her\nbig bright eyes, and sent for dressmakers.\n\nShe ordered two robes each of five ells, the one to be of green and\nlined with either cendal or sarcenet, and the other to be of brunet\nstuff. She selected the cloth for a pair of purple sandals, and for four\npairs of boots, to be embroidered in circles around the ankles, and she\nselected also nine very becoming chaplets made of gold filigree and\nclusters of precious stones. And so she managed to get through the\nmorning, and to put Manuel out of mind, for that while, but not for\nlong.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nWhat Helmas Directed\n\n\nNow the Count of Poictesme departs from Provence, with his lackeys\ncarrying his images, and early in April he comes to Helmas the\nDeep-Minded. The wise King was then playing with his small daughter\nM\u00e9lusine (who later dethroned and imprisoned him), but he sent the child\naway with a kiss, and he attentively heard Dom Manuel through.\n\nKing Helmas looked at the images, prodded them with a shriveled\nforefinger, and cleared his throat; and then said nothing, because,\nafter all, Dom Manuel was Count of Poictesme.\n\n\"What is needed?\" said Manuel.\n\n\"They are not true to life,\" replied Helmas--\"particularly this one\nwhich has the look of me.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know that: but who can give life to my images?\"\n\nKing Helmas pushed back his second best crown, wherein was set the\nfeather from the wing of the miller's goose, and he scratched his\nforehead. He said, \"There is a power over all figures of earth and a\nqueen whose will is neither to loose nor to bind.\" Helmas turned toward\na thick book, wherein was magic.\n\n\"Yes, _queen_ is the same as _cwen_. Therefore Queen Freydis of Audela\nmight help you.\"\n\n\"Yes, for it is she that owns Schamir. But the falcons are not nesting\nnow, and how can I go to Freydis, that woman of strange deeds?\"\n\n\"Oh, people nowadays no longer use falcons; and of course nobody can go\nto Freydis uninvited. Still, it can be managed that Freydis will come to\nyou when the moon is void and powerless, and when this and that has been\narranged.\"\n\nThereafter Helmas the Deep-Minded told Count Manuel what was requisite.\n\"So you will need such and such things,\" says King Helmas, \"but, above\nall, do not forget the ointment.\"\n\nCount Manuel went alone into Poictesme, which was his fief if only he\ncould get it. He came secretly to Upper Morven, that place of horrible\nfame. Near the ten-colored stone, whereon men had sacrificed to Vel-Tyno\nin time's youth, he builded an enclosure of peeled willow wands, and\nspread butter upon them, and tied them with knots of yellow ribbons, as\nHelmas had directed. Manuel arranged all matters within the enclosure as\nHelmas had directed. There Manuel waited, on the last night in April,\nregarding the full moon.\n\nIn a while you saw the shadowings on the moon's radiancy begin to waver\nand move: later they passed from the moon's face like little clouds, and\nthe moon was naked of markings. This was a token that the Moon-Children\nhad gone to the well from which once a month they fetch water, and that\nfor an hour the moon would be void and powerless. With this and that\nceremony Count Manuel kindled such a fire upon the old altar of Vel-Tyno\nas Helmas had directed.\n\nManuel cried aloud: \"Now be propitious, infernal, terrestrial and\ncelestial Bombo! Lady of highways, patroness of crossroads, thou who\nbearest the light! Thou who dost labor always in obscurity, thou enemy of\nthe day, thou friend and companion of darkness! Thou rejoicing in the\nbarking of dogs and in shed blood, thus do I honor thee.\"\n\nManuel did as Helmas had directed, and for an instant the screamings\nwere pitiable, but the fire ended these speedily.\n\nThen Manuel cried, again: \"O thou who wanderest amid shadows and over\ntombs, and dost tether even the strong sea! O whimsical sister of the\nblighting sun, and fickle mistress of old death! O Gorgo, Mormo, lady of\na thousand forms and qualities! now view with a propitious eye my\nsacrifice!\"\n\nThus Manuel spoke, and steadily the fire upon the altar grew larger and\nbrighter as he nourished it repugnantly.\n\nWhen the fire was the height of a warrior, and queer things were\nhappening to this side and to that side, Count Manuel spoke the ordered\nwords: and of a sudden the flames' colors were altered, so that green\nshimmerings showed in the fire, as though salt were burning there.\nManuel waited. This greenness shifted and writhed and increased in the\nheart of the fire, and out of the fire oozed a green serpent, the body\nof which was well--nigh as thick as a man's body.\n\nThis portent came toward Count Manuel horribly. He, who was familiar\nwith serpents, now grasped this monster's throat, and to the touch its\nscales were like very cold glass.\n\nThe great snake shifted so resistlessly that Manuel was forced back\ntoward the fire and toward a doom more dreadful than burning: and the\nfirelight was in the snake's contemptuous wise eyes. Manuel was of\nstalwart person, but his strength availed him nothing until he began to\nrecite aloud, as Helmas had directed, the multiplication tables: Freydis\ncould not withstand mathematics.\n\nSo when Manuel had come to two times eleven the tall fire guttered as\nthough it bended under the passing of a strong wind: then the flames\nburned high, and Manuel could see that he was grasping the throat of a\nmonstrous pig. He, who was familiar with pigs, could see that this was a\nblack pig, caked with dried curds of the Milky Way; its flesh was chill\nto the touch, like dead flesh; and it had long tusks, which possessed\nlife of their own, and groped and writhed toward Manuel like fat white\nworms.\n\nThen Manuel said, as Helmas had directed: \"Solomon's provision for one\nday was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,\nten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep,\nbeside harts, and roebucks, and fallow deer, and fatted fowl. But Elijah\nthe Tishbite was fed by ravens that brought him bread and flesh.\"\n\nAgain the tall flames guttered. Now Manuel was grasping a thick heatless\nslab of crystal, like a mirror, wherein he could see himself quite\nclearly. Just as he really was, he, who was not familiar with such\nmirrors, could see Count Manuel, housed in a little wet dirt with old\ninveterate stars adrift about him everywhither; and the spectacle was\nenough to frighten anybody.\n\nSo Manuel said: \"The elephant is the largest of all animals, and in\nintelligence approaches the nearest to man. Its nostril is elongated,\nand answers to the purpose of a hand. Its toes are undivided, and it\nlives two hundred years. Africa breeds elephants, but India produces the\nlargest.\"\n\nThe mirror now had melted into a dark warm fluid which oozed between his\nfingers, dripping to the ground. But Manuel held tightly to what\nremained between his palms, and he felt, they say, that in the fluid was\nstruggling something small and soft and living, as though he held a tiny\nminnow.\n\nSaid Manuel, \"A straight line is the shortest distance between two\npoints.\"\n\nOf a sudden the fire became an ordinary fire, and the witches of Amneran\nscreamed, and Morven was emptied of sorcery, and Count Manuel was\ngrasping the warm soft throat of a woman. Instantly he had her within\nthe enclosure of peeled willow wands that had been spread with butter\nand tied with knots of yellow ribbon, because into such an enclosure the\npower and the dominion of Freydis could never enter.\n\nAll these things Manuel did precisely as King Helmas had directed.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\nThey Duel on Morven\n\n\nSo by the light of the seven candles Dom Manuel first saw Queen Freydis\nin her own shape, and in the appearance which she wore in her own\ncountry. What Manuel thought there was never any telling: but every\nother man who saw Queen Freydis in this appearance declared that\ninstantly all his past life became a drugged prelude to the moment\nwherein he stood face to face with Freydis, the high Queen of Audela.\n\nFreydis showed now as the most lovely of womankind. She had black\nplaited hair, and folds of crimson silk were over her white flesh, and\nover her shoulders was a black cloak embroidered with little gold stars\nand ink-horns, and she wore sandals of gilded bronze. But in her face\nwas such loveliness as may not be told.\n\nNow Freydis went from one side of the place to the other side, and saw\nthe magics that protected the enclosure. \"Certainly, you have me fast,\"\nthe high Queen said. \"What is it you want of me?\"\n\nManuel showed her the three images which he had made, set there arow. \"I\nneed your aid with these.\"\n\nQueen Freydis looked at them, and Freydis smiled. \"These frozen\nabortions are painstakingly made. What more can anybody demand?\"\n\nDom Manuel told her that he desired to make an animated and lively\nfigure.\n\nWhereupon she laughed, merrily and sweetly and scornfully, and replied\nthat never would she give such aid.\n\n\"Very well, then,\" said Manuel, \"I have ready the means to compel you.\"\nHe showed this lovely woman the instruments of her torture. His handsome\nyoung face was very grave, as though already his heart were troubled. He\nthrust her hand into the cruel vise which was prepared. \"Now, sorceress,\nwhom all men dread save me, you shall tell me the Tuyla incantation as\nthe reward of my endeavors, or else a little by a little I shall destroy\nthe hand that has wrought so many mischiefs.\"\n\nFreydis in the light of the seven candles showed pale as milk. She said:\n\"I am frail and human in this place, and have no power beyond the power\nof every woman, and no strength at all. Nevertheless, I will tell you\nnothing.\"\n\nManuel set his hand to the lever, ready to loose destruction. \"To tell\nme what I desire you to tell me will do you no hurt--\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Freydis: \"but I am not going to take orders from you or\nany man breathing.\"\n\n\"--And for defying me you will suffer very terribly--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Freydis. \"And much you will care!\" she said,\nreproachfully.\n\n\"--Therefore I think that you are acting foolishly.\"\n\nFreydis said: \"You make a human woman of me, and then expect me to act\nupon reason. It is you who are behaving foolishly.\"\n\nCount Manuel meditated, for this beyond doubt sounded sensible. From\nthe look of his handsome young face, his heart was now exceedingly\ntroubled. Queen Freydis breathed more freely, and began to smile, with\nthe wisdom of women, which is not super-human, but is ruthless.\n\n\"The hand would be quite ruined, too,\" said Manuel, looking at it more\ncarefully. Upon the middle finger was a copper ring, in which was set a\nlargish black stone: this was Schamir. But Manuel looked only at the\nhand.\n\nHe touched it. \"Your hand, Queen Freydis, whatever mischief it may have\nexecuted, is soft as velvet. It is colored like rose-petals, but it\nsmells more sweet than they. No, certainly, my images are not worth the\nruining of such a hand.\"\n\nThen Manuel released her, sighing. \"My geas must stay upon me, and my\nimages must wait,\" says Manuel.\n\n\"Why, do you really like my hands?\" asked Freydis, regarding them\ncritically.\n\nManuel said: \"Ah, fair sweet enemy, do not mock at me! All is in\nreadiness to compel you to do my will. Had you preserved some ugly shape\nI would have conquered you. But against the shape which you now wear I\ncannot contend. Dragons and warlocks and chimaeras and such nameless\nmonsters as I perceive to be crowding about this enclosure of buttered\nwillow wands I do not fear at all, but I cannot fight against the\nappearance which you now wear.\"\n\n\"Why, do you really like my natural appearance?\" Freydis said,\nincredibly surprised. \"It is a comfort, of course, to slip into it\noccasionally, but I had never really thought much about it one way or\nthe other--\"\n\nShe went to the great mirror which had been set ready as Helmas\ndirected, \"I never liked my hair in these severe big plaits, either. As\nfor those monsters yonder, they are my people, who are coming out of the\nfire to rescue me, in some of the forgotten shapes, as spoorns and trows\nand calcars, and other terrors of antiquity. But they cannot get into\nthis enclosure of buttered willow wands, poor dears, on account of your\nmagickings. How foolish they look--do they not?--leering and capering\nand gnashing their teeth, with no superstitious persons anywhere to pay\nattention to them.\"\n\nThe Queen paused: she coughed delicately. \"But you were talking some\nnonsense or other about my natural appearance not being bad looking. Now\nmost men prefer blondes, and, besides, you are not really listening to\nme, and that is not polite.\"\n\n\"It is so difficult to talk collectedly,\" said Manuel, \"with your\nappalling servitors leering and capering and gnashing double sets of\nteeth all over Upper Morven--\"\n\nShe saw the justice of this. She went now to that doorway through which,\nunless a man lifted her over the threshold, she might not pass, on\naccount of the tonthecs and the spaks and the horseshoes.\n\nShe cried, in a high sweet voice: \"A penny, a penny, twopence, a penny\nand a half, and a half-penny! Now do you go away, all of you, for the\nwisdom of Helmas is too strong for us. There is no way for you to get\ninto, nor for me to get out of, this place of buttered willow wands,\nuntil I have deluded and circumvented this pestiferous, squinting young\nmortal. Go down into Bellegarde and spill the blood of Northmen, or\nraise a hailstorm, or amuse yourselves in one way or another way.\nAnyhow, do you take no thought for me, who am for the while a human\nwoman: for my adversary is a mortal man, and in that duel never yet has\nthe man conquered.\"\n\nShe turned to Manuel. She said:\n\n\"The land of Audela is my kingdom. But you embraced my penalties, you\nhave made a human woman of me. So do I tread with wraiths, for my lost\nrealm alone is real. Here all is but a restless contention of shadows\nwhich pass presently; here all that is visible and all the colors known\nto men are shadows dimming the true colors; here time and death, the\ndarkest shadows known to men, delude you with false seemings: for all\nsuch things as men hold incontestable, because they are apparent to\nsight and sense, are a weariful drifting of fogs that veil the world\nwhich is no longer mine. So in this twilit world of yours do we of\nAudela appear to be but men and women.\"\n\n\"I would that such women appeared more often,\" said Manuel.\n\n\"The land of Audela is my kingdom, where I am Queen of all that lies\nbehind this veil of human sight and sense. This veil may not ever be\nlifted; but very often the veil is pierced, and noting the broken place,\nmen call it fire. Through these torn places men may glimpse the world\nthat is real: and this glimpse dazzles their dimmed eyes and weakling\nforces, and this glimpse mocks at their lean might Through these rent\nplaces, when the opening is made large enough, a few men here and there,\nnot quite so witless as their fellows, know how to summon us of Audela\nwhen for an hour the moon is void and powerless: we come for an old\nreason: and we come as men and women.\"\n\n\"Ah, but you do not speak with the voices of men and women,\" Manuel\nreplied, \"for your voice is music.\"\n\n\"The land of Audela is my kingdom, and very often, just for the sport's\nsake, do I and my servitors go secretly among you. As human beings we\nblunder about your darkened shadow world, bound by the laws of sight and\nsense, but keeping always in our hearts the secrets of Audela and the\nsecret of our manner of returning thither. Sometimes, too, for the\nsport's sake, we imprison in earthen figures a spark of the true life of\nAudela: and then you little persons, that have no authentic life, but\nonly the flickering of a vexed shadow to sustain you in brief\nfretfulness, say it is very pretty; and you negligently applaud us as\nthe most trivial of men and women.\"\n\n\"No; we applaud you as the most beautiful,\" says Manuel.\n\n\"Come now, Count Manuel, and do you have done with your silly\nflatterings, which will never wheedle anything out of me! So you have\ntrapped Queen Freydis in mortal flesh. Therefore I must abide in the\nbody of a human woman, and be subject to your whims, and to your\nbeautiful big muscles, you think, until I lend a spark of Audela's true\nlife to your ridiculous images. But I will show you better, for I will\nnever give in to you nor to any man breathing.\"\n\nIn silence Count Manuel regarded the delightful shaping and the clear\nburning colors of this woman's face. He said, as if in sadness: \"The\nimages no longer matter. It is better to leave them as they are.\"\n\n\"That is very foolish talk,\" Queen Freydis answered, promptly, \"for they\nneed my aid if ever any images did. Not that, however, I intend to touch\nthem.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I forbid you to touch them, fair enemy. For were the images\nmade as animated and lively as I wish them to be, I would be looking at\nthem always, and not caring for any woman: and no woman anywhere would\nhave the power to move me as your beauty moves me now, and I would not\nbe valuing you the worth of an old onion.\"\n\n\"That is not the truth,\" says Freydis, angrily, \"for the man who is\nsatisfied with the figure he has made is as great a fool about women as\nany other man. And who are you to be forbidding me anything?\"\n\n\"I would have you remember,\" said Manuel, very masterfully, \"that they\nare my images, to do with as I wish. Also I would have you remember\nthat, whatever you may pretend to be in Audela, here I am stronger than\nyou.\"\n\nNow the proud woman laughed. Defiantly she touched the nearest image,\nwith formal ancient gestures, and you could see the black stone Schamir\ntaking on the colors of an opal. Under her touch the clay image which\nhad the look of Alianora shivered, and drew sobbing breath. The image\nrose, a living creature that was far more beautiful than human kind, and\nit regarded Manuel scornfully. Then it passed limping from the\nenclosure: and Manuel sighed.\n\n\"That is a strong magic,\" said Manuel: \"and this is almost exactly the\nadmirable and significant figure that I desired to make in the world.\nBut, as I now perceive too late, I fashioned the legs of this figure\nunevenly, and the joy I have in its life is less than the shame that I\ntake from its limping.\"\n\n\"Such magic is a trifle,\" Freydis replied, \"although it is the only\nmagic I can perform in an enclosure of buttered willow wands. Now, then,\nyou see for yourself that I am not going to take orders from you. So the\nfigure you have made, will you or nil you, must limp about in all men's\nsight, for not more than a few centuries, to be sure, but long enough to\nprove that I am not going to be dictated to.\"\n\n\"I do not greatly care, O fairest and most shrewd of enemies. A half-hour\nsince, it seemed to me an important matter to wrest from you this secret\nof giving life to images. Now I have seen the miracle; I know that for\nthe man who has your favor it is possible to become as a god, creating\nlife, and creating lovelier living beings than any god creates, and\nbeings which live longer, too: and even so, it is not of these things\nthat I am really thinking, but only of your eyes.\"\n\n\"Why, do you like my eyes!\" says Freydis,--\"you, who if once you could\nmake living images would never be caring about any woman any more?\"\n\nBut Manuel told her wherein her eyes were different from the eyes of any\nother person, and more dangerous, and she listened, willingly enough,\nfor Freydis was not a human woman. Thereafter it appeared that a\ngrieving and a great trouble of mind had come upon Manuel because of the\nloveliness of Freydis, for he made this complaint:\n\n\"There is much loss in the world, where men war ceaselessly with sorrow,\nand time like a strong thief strips all men of all they prize. Yet when\nthe emperor is beaten in battle and his broad lands are lost, he,\nshrugging, says, 'In the next battle I may conquer.' And when the\nbearded merchant's ship is lost at sea, he says, 'The next voyage,\nbelike, will be prosperous.' Even when the life of an old beggar departs\nfrom him in a ditch, he says, 'I trust to be to-morrow a glad young\nseraph in paradise.' Thus hope serves as a cordial for every hurt: but\nfor him who had beheld the loveliness of Freydis there is no hope at\nall.\n\n\"For, in comparison with that alien clear beauty, there is no beauty in\nthis world. He that has beheld the loveliness of Freydis must go\nhenceforward as a hungry person, because of troubling memories: and his\nfellows deride him enviously. All the world is fretted by his folly,\nknowing that his faith in the world's might is no longer firm-set, and\nthat he aspires to what is beyond the world's giving. In his heart he\nbelittles the strong stupid lords of earth; and they, being strong, plan\nvengeance, the while that in a corner he makes images to commemorate\nwhat is lost: and so for him who has beheld the loveliness of Freydis\nthere is no hope at all.\n\n\"He that has willed to look upon Queen Freydis does not dread to consort\nwith serpents nor with swine; he faces the mirror wherein a man beholds\nhimself without self-deceiving; he views the blood that drips from his\nsoiled hands, and knows that this, too, was needed: yet these endurings\npurchase but one hour. The hour passes, and therewith passes also\nFreydis, the high Queen. Only the memory of her hour remains, like a\ncruel gadfly, for which the crazed beholder of Queen Freydis must build\na lodging in his images, madly endeavoring to commingle memories with\nwet mud: and so for him who has beheld the loveliness of Freydis there\nis no hope at all.\"\n\nFreydis heard him through, considerately. \"But I wonder to how many\nother women you have talked such nonsense about beauty and despair and\neternity,\" said Freydis, \"and they very probably liking to hear it, the\npoor fools! And I wonder how you can expect me to believe you, when you\npretend to think me all these fine things, and still keep me penned in\nthis enclosure like an old vicious cow.\"\n\n\"No, that is not the way it is any longer. For now the figure that I\nhave made in the world, and all else that is in the world, and all that\nis anywhere without this enclosure of buttered willow wands, mean\nnothing to me, and there is no meaning in anything save in the\nloveliness of Freydis.\"\n\nDom Manuel went to the door of the enclosure then to the windows,\nsweeping away the gilded tonthecs and the shining spaks, and removing\nfrom the copper nails the horseshoes that had been cast by Mohammed's\nmare and Hrimfaxi and Balaam's ass and Pegasus. \"You were within my\npower. Now I destroy that power, and therewith myself. Now is the place\nunguarded, and all your servitors are free to enter, and all your\nterrors are untrammeled, to be loosed against me, who have no longer\nanything to dread. For I love you with such mortal love as values\nnothing else beside its desire, and you care nothing for me.\"\n\nAfter a little while of looking she sighed, and said uneasily: \"It is\nthe foolish deed of a true lover. And, really, I do like you, rather.\nBut, Manuel, I do not know what to do next! Never at any time has this\nthing happened before, so that all my garnered wisdom is of no use\nwhatever. Nobody anywhere has ever dared to snap his fingers at the fell\npower of Freydis as you are doing, far less has anybody ever dared to be\nmaking eyes at her. Besides, I do not wish to consume you with\nlightnings, and to smite you with insanity appears so unnecessary.\"\n\n\"I love you,\" Manuel said, \"and your heart is hard, and your beauty is\nbeyond the thinking of man, and your will is neither to loose nor to\nbind. In a predicament so unexampled, how can it at all matter to me\nwhatever you may elect to do?\"\n\n\"Then certainly I shall not waste any of my fine terrors on you!\" said\nFreydis, with a vexed tossing of her head. \"Nor have I any more time to\nwaste upon you either, for presently the Moon-Children will be coming\nback to their places: and before the hour is out wherein the moon stays\nvoid and powerless I must return to my own kingdom, whither you may not\nfollow, to provoke me with any more of your nonsense. And then you will\nbe properly sorry, I dare say, for you will De remembering me always,\nand there will be only human women to divert you, and they are poor\ncreatures.\"\n\nFreydis went again to the mirror, and she meditated there. \"Yes, you\nwill be remembering me with my hair in these awful plaits, and that is a\npity, but still you will remember me always. And when you make images\nthey will be images of me. No, but I cannot have you making any more\noutrageous parodies like astonished corpses, and people everywhere\nlaughing at Queen Freydis!\"\n\nShe took up the magical pen, laid ready as Helmas had directed, and she\nwrote with this gryphon's feather. \"So here is the recipe for the Tuyla\nincantation with which to give life to your images. It may comfort you a\nlittle to perform that silly magic. It, anyhow, will prevent such\ngood-for-nothing minxes as may have no more intelligence than to take\nyou seriously, from putting on too many airs and graces around the\nimages which you will make of me with my hair done so very\nunbecomingly.\"\n\n\"Nothing can ever comfort me, fair enemy, when you have gone away,\" said\nManuel.\n\nBut he took the parchment.\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\n\nBandages for the Victor\n\n\nThey came out of the enclosure, to the old altar of Vel-Tyno, while the\nmoon was still void and powerless. The servitors of Freydis were\nthronging swiftly toward Upper Morven, after a pleasant hour of ravening\nand ramping about Poictesme. As spoorns and trows and calcars and as\nother long forgotten shapes they came, without any noise, so that Upper\nMorven was like the disordered mind of a wretch that is dying in fever:\nand to this side and to that side the witches of Amneran sat nodding in\napproval of what they saw.\n\nThus, one by one, the forgotten shapes came to the fire, and cried, \"A\npenny, a penny, twopence, a penny and a half, and a halfpenny!\" as each\nentered into the fire which was the gateway to their home.\n\n\"Farewell!\" said Freydis: and as she spoke she sighed.\n\n\"Not thus must be our parting,\" Manuel says. \"For do you listen now,\nQueen Freydis! it was Helmas the Deep-Minded who told me what was\nrequisite. '_Queen_ is the same as _cwen_, which means a woman, no more\nnor less,' said the wise King. 'You have but to remember that.'\"\n\nShe took his meaning. Freydis cried out, angrily: \"Then all the\nfoolishness you have been talking about my looks and your love for me\nwas pre-arranged! And you have cheated me out of the old Tuyla mystery\nby putting on the appearance of loving me, and by pestering me with such\nnonsense as a plowman trades against the heart of a milkmaid! Now,\ncertainly, I shall reward your candor in a fashion that will be\nwhispered about for a long while.\"\n\nWith that, Queen Freydis set about a devastating magic.\n\n\"All, all was pre-arranged save one thing,\" said Manuel, with a yapping\nlaugh, and not even looking at the commencing terrors. He thrust into\nthe fire the parchment which Freydis had given him. \"Yes, all was\npre-arranged except that Helmas did not purge me of that which will not\naccept the hire of any lying to you. So the Deep-Minded's wisdom comes,\nat the last pinch, to naught.\"\n\nNow Freydis for an instant waved back two-thirds of an appalling\nmonster, which was as yet incompletely evoked for Dom Manuel's\ndestruction, and Freydis cried impatiently, \"But have you no sense\nwhatever! for you are burning your hand.\"\n\nAnd indeed the boy had already withdrawn his hand with a grimace, for in\nthe ardor of executing his noble gesture, as Queen Freydis saw, he had\nnot estimated how hot her fires were.\n\n\"It is but a little hurt to me who have taken a great hurt,\" says\nManuel, sullenly. \"For I had thought to lie, and in my mouth the lie\nturned to a truth. At least, I do not profit by my false-dealing, and I\nwave you farewell with empty hands burned clean of theft.\"\n\nThen she who was a human woman said, \"But you have burned your hand!\"\n\n\"It does not matter: I have ointments yonder. Make haste, Queen Freydis,\nfor the hour passes wherein the moon is void and powerless.\"\n\n\"There is time.\" She brought out water from the enclosure, and swiftly\nbathed Dom Manuel's hand.\n\nFrom the fire now came a whispering, \"Make haste, Queen Freydis! make\nhaste, dear Fairy mistress!\"\n\n\"There is time,\" said Freydis, \"and do you stop flurrying me!\" She\nbrought from the enclosure a pot of ointment, and she dressed Manuel's\nhand.\n\n\"Borram, borram, Leanhaun shee!\" the fire crackled. \"Now the hour ends.\"\n\nThen Freydis sprang from Manuel, toward the flames beyond which she was\nqueen of ancient mysteries, and beyond which her will was neither to\nloose nor to bind. And she cried hastily, \"A penny, a penny, twopence--\"\n\nBut just for a moment she looked back at Morven, and at the man who\nwaited upon Morven alone and hurt. In his firelit eyes she saw love out\nof measure and without hope. And in the breast of Freydis moved the\nheart of a human woman.\n\n\"I cannot help it,\" she said, as the hour passed. \"Somebody has to\nbandage it, and men have no sense in these matters.\"\n\nWhereon the fire roared angrily, and leaped, and fell dead, for the\nMoon-Children Bil and Hjuki had returned from the well which is called\nByrgir, and the moon was no longer void and powerless.\n\n\"So, does that feel more comfortable?\" said Freydis. She knew that\nwithin this moment age and sorrow and death had somewhere laid\ninevitable ambuscades, from which to assail her by and by, for she was\nmortal after the sacred fire's extinction, and she meant to make the\nbest of it.\n\nFor a while Count Manuel did not speak. Then he said, in a shaking\nvoice: \"O woman dear and lovely and credulous and compassionate, it is\nyou and you alone that I must be loving eternally with such tenderness\nas is denied to proud and lonely queens on their tall thrones! And it is\nyou that I must be serving always with such a love as may not be given\nto the figure that any man makes in this world! And though all life may\nbe a dusty waste of endless striving, and though the ways of men may\nalways be the ways of folly, yet are these ways our ways henceforward,\nand not hopeless ways, for you and I will tread them together.\"\n\n\"Now certainly there is in Audela no such moonstruck nonsense to be\nhearing, nor any such quick-footed hour of foolishness to be living\nthrough,\" Freydis replied, \"as here to-night has robbed me of my\nkingdom.\"\n\n\"Love will repay,\" said Manuel, as is the easy fashion of men.\n\nAnd Freydis, a human woman now in all things, laughed low and softly in\nthe darkness. \"Repay me thus, my dearest: no matter how much I may coax\nyou in the doubtful time to come, do you not ever tell me how you\nhappened to have the bandages and the pot of ointment set ready by the\nmirror. For it is bad for a human woman ever to be seeing through the\ndevices of wise kings, and far worse for her to be seeing through the\nheroic antics of her husband.\"\n\nMeanwhile in Arles young Alianora had arranged her own match with more\ncircumspection. The English, who at first demanded twenty thousand marks\nas her jointure, had after interminable bargaining agreed to accept her\nwith three thousand: and she was to be dowered with Plymouth and Exeter\nand Tiverton and Torquay and Brixham, and with the tin mines of\nDevonshire and Cornwall. In everything except the husband involved, she\nwas marrying excellently, and so all Arles that night was ornamented\nwith flags and banners and chaplets and bright hangings and flaring\nlamps and torches, and throughout Provence there was festivity of every\nsort, and the Princess had great honor and applause.\n\nBut in the darkness of Upper Morven they had happiness, no matter for\nhow brief a while.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nPART THREE\n\n\nTHE BOOK OF CAST ACCOUNTS\n\n\nTO\n\nH.L. MENCKEN\n\n\n\nConsider, _faire Miserie, (quoth Manuel) that it lyes not in mans power\nto place his loue where he list, being the worke of an high Deity._ A\nBirde was neuer seen in Pontus, _nor true loue in a fleeting mynde:\nneuer shall remoue the affection of my Hearte, which in nature\nresembleth the stone_ Abiston.\n\n\n\nXVI\n\n\nFreydis\n\n\nThey of Poictesme narrate how Queen Freydis and Count Manuel lived\ntogether amicably upon Upper Morven. They tell also how the iniquitous\nusurper, Duke Asmund, at this time held Bellegarde close at hand, but\nthat his Northmen kept away from Upper Morven, on account of the\nsupernatural beings you were always apt to encounter thereabouts, so\nthat Manuel and Freydis had, at first, no human company.\n\n\"Between now and a while,\" said Freydis, \"you must be capturing\nBellegarde and cutting off Duke Asmund's ugly head, because by right and\nby King Ferdinand's own handwriting all Poictesme belongs to you.\"\n\n\"Well, we will let that wait a bit,\" says Manuel, \"for I do not so\nheartily wish to be tied down with parchments in a count's gilded seat\nas I do to travel everywhither and see the ends of this world and judge\nthem. At all events, dear Freydis, I am content enough for the present,\nin this little home of ours, and public affairs can wait.\"\n\n\"Still, something ought to be done about it,\" said Freydis. And, since\nManuel displayed an obstinate prejudice against any lethal plague, she\nput the puckerel curse upon Asmund, by which he was afflicted with all\nsmall bodily ills that can intervene between corns and dandruff.\n\nOn Upper Morven Freydis had reared by enchantment a modest home, that\nwas builded of jasper and porphyry and yellow and violet breccia.\nInside, the stone walls were everywhere covered with significant\ntraceries in low relief, and were incrusted at intervals with disks and\ntesserae of turquoise-colored porcelain. The flooring, of course, was of\nzinc, as a defence against the unfriendly Alfs, who are at perpetual war\nwith Audela, and, moreover, there was a palisade, enclosing all, of\npeeled willow wands, not buttered but oiled, and fastened with unknotted\nribbons.\n\nEverything was very simple and homelike, and here the servitors of\nFreydis attended them when there was need. The fallen Queen was not a\ngray witch--not in appearance certainly, but in her endowments, which\nwere not limited as are the powers of black witches and white witches.\nShe instructed Dom Manuel in the magic of Audela, and she and Manuel had\ngreat times together that spring and summer, evoking ancient dis-crowned\ngods and droll monsters and instructive ghosts to entertain them in the\npauses between other pleasures.\n\nThey heard no more, for that turn, of the clay figure to which they had\ngiven life, save for the news brought, by a bogglebo, that as the\nlimping gay young fellow went down from Morven the reputable citizenry\neverywhere were horrified because he went as he was created,\nstark-naked, and this was not considered respectable. So a large\ntumble-bug came from the west, out of the quagmires of Philistia and\nfollowed after the animated figure, yelping and spluttering, \"Morals,\nnot art!\" And for that while, the figure went out of Manuel's saga, thus\nmalodorously accompanied.\n\n\"But we will make a much finer figure,\" says Freydis, \"so it does not\nmatter.\"\n\n\"Yes, by and by,\" says Manuel, \"but we will let that wait a bit.\"\n\n\"You are always saying that nowadays!\"\n\n\"Ah, but, my dear, it is so very pleasant to rest here doing nothing\nserious for a little while, now that my geas is discharged. Presently of\ncourse we must be travelling everywhither, and when we have seen the\nends of this world, and have judged them, I shall have time, and greater\nknowledge too, to give to this image making--\"\n\n\"It is not from any remote strange places, dear Manuel, but from his own\nland that a man must get the earth for this image making--\"\n\n\"Well, be that as it may, your kisses are to me far more delicious than\nyour magic.\"\n\n\"I love to hear you say that, my dearest, but still--\"\n\n\"No, not at all, for you are really much nicer when you are cuddling so,\nthan when you are running about the world pretending to be pigs and\nsnakes and fireworks, and murdering people with your extravagant\nsorceries.\"\n\nSaying this, he kissed her, and thus stilled her protests, for in these\namiable times Queen Freydis also was at bottom less interested in magic\nthan in kisses. Indeed, there was never any sorceress more loving and\ntender than Freydis, now that she had become a human woman.\n\nIf ever she was irritable it was only when Manuel confessed, in reply to\njealous questionings, that he did not find her quite so beautiful nor so\nclever as Niafer had been: but this, as Manuel pointed out, could not be\nhelped. For there had never been anybody like Niafer, and it would be\nnonsense to say otherwise.\n\nIt is possible that Dom Manuel believed this. The rather homely, not\nintelligent, and in no respect bedazzling servant girl may well have\nbeen--in the inexplicable way these things fell out,--the woman whom\nManuel's heart had chosen, and who therefore in his eyes for the rest of\ntime must differ from all other persons. Certainly no unastigmatic judge\nwould have decreed this swarthy Niafer fit, as the phrase is, to hold a\ncandle either to Freydis or Alianora: whereas Manuel did not conceal,\neven from these royal ladies themselves, his personal if unique\nevaluations.\n\nTo the other side, some say that ladies who are used to hourly\nadmiration cannot endure the passing of a man who seems to admire not\nquite wholeheartedly. He who does not admire at all is obviously a fool,\nand not worth bothering about. But to him who admits, \"You are well\nenough,\" and makes as though to pass on, there is a mystery attached:\nand the one way to solve it is to pursue this irritating fellow. Some\n(reasoning thus) assert that squinting Manuel was aware of this axiom,\nand that he respected it in all his dealings with Freydis and Alianora.\nEither way, these theorists did not ever get any verbal buttressing from\nDom Manuel. Niafer dead and lost to him, he, without flaunting any\nunexampled ardors, fell to loving Alianora: and now that Freydis had put\noff immortality for his kisses, the tall boy had, again, somewhat the\nair of consenting to accept this woman's sacrifice, and her loveliness\nand all her power and wisdom, as being upon the whole the handiest\navailable substitute for Niafer's sparse charms.\n\nYet others declare, more simply, that Dom Manuel was so constituted as\nto value more cheaply every desire after he had attained it. And these\nsay he noted that--again in the inexplicable way these things fall\nout,--now Manuel possessed the unearthly Queen she had become, precisely\nas Alianora had become, a not extraordinary person, who in all commerce\nwith her lover dealt as such.\n\n\"But do you really love me, O man of all men?\" Freydis would say, \"and,\nthis damned Niafer apart, do you love me a little more than you love any\nother woman?\"\n\n\"Why, are there any other women?\" says Manuel, in fine surprise. \"Oh, to\nbe sure, I suppose there are, but I had forgotten about them. I have not\nheard or seen or thought of those petticoated creatures since my dear\nFreydis came.\"\n\nThe sorceress purred at this sort of talk, and she rested her head where\nthere seemed a place especially made for it. \"I wish I could believe\nyour words, king of my heart. I have to strive so hard, nowadays, to\ngoad you into saying these idiotic suitable dear things: and even when\nat last you do say them your voice is light and high, and makes them\nsound as though you were joking.\"\n\nHe kissed the thick coil of hair which lay fragrant against his lips.\n\"Do you know, in spite of my joking, I do love you a great deal?\"\n\n\"I would practise saying that over to myself,\" observed Freydis\ncritically. \"You should let your voice break a little after the first\nthree words.\"\n\n\"I speak as I feel. I love you, Freydis, and I tell you so.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you are no longer a perpetual nuisance about it.\"\n\n\"Alas, my dear, you are no longer the unattainable Queen of the country\non the other side of the fire, and that makes a difference, certainly.\nIt is equally certain that I love you over and above all living women.\"\n\n\"Ah, but, my dearest, who loves you more than any human tongue can\ntell?\"\n\n\"A peculiarly obstinate and lovely imbecile,\" says Manuel; and he did\nthat which seemed suitable.\n\nLater Freydis sighed luxuriously. \"That saves you the trouble of\ntalking, does it not? And you talked so madly and handsomely that first\nnight, when you wanted to get around me on account of the image, but now\nyou do not make me any pretty speeches at all.\"\n\n\"Oh, heavens!\" said Manuel, \"but I am embracing a monomaniac. Dear\nFreydis, whatever I might say would be perforce the same old words that\nhave been whispered by millions of men to many more millions of women,\nand my love for you is a quite unparalleled thing which ought not to be\ntravestied by any such shopworn apparel.\"\n\n\"Now again you must be putting me off with solemn joking in that light\nhigh voice, and there is no faithfulness in that voice, and its talking\ntroubles me.\"\n\n\"I speak as I feel. I love you, Freydis, and I tell you so, but I cannot\nbe telling it over and over again every quarter of the hour.\"\n\n\"Oh, but very certainly this big squinting boy is the most unloquacious\nand the most stubborn brute that ever lived!\"\n\n\"And would you have me otherwise?\"\n\n\"No, that is the queer part of it. But it is a grief to me to wonder if\nyou foresaw as much.\"\n\n\"I!\" says Manuel, jovially. \"But what would I be doing with any such\nfinespun policies? My dear, until you comprehend I am the most frank and\ndownright creature that ever lived you do not begin to appreciate me.\"\n\n\"I know you are, big boy. But still, I wonder,\" Freydis said, \"and the\nwondering is a thin little far-off grief.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\n\nMagic of the Image-Makers\n\n\nIt was presently noised abroad that Queen Freydis of Audela had become a\nhuman woman; and thereafter certain enchanters came to Upper Morven, to\nseek her counsel and her favor and the aid of Schamir. These were the\nenchanters, Manuel was told, who made images, to which they now and then\ncontrived--nobody seemed to know quite how, and least of all did the\nthaumaturgists themselves,--to impart life.\n\nOnce Manuel went with Freydis into a dark place where some of these\nmagic-workers were at labor. By the light of a charcoal fire, clay\nimages were ruddily discernible; before these the enchanters moved\nunhumanly clad, and doing things which, mercifully perhaps, were veiled\nfrom Manuel by the peculiarly perfumed obscurity.\n\nAs Manuel entered the gallery one of the magic-workers was chaunting\nshrilly in the darkness below. \"It is the unfinished Rune of the\nBlackbirds,\" says Freydis, in a whisper.\n\nBelow them the troubled wailing continued:\n\n\"--Crammed and squeezed, so entombed (on some wager I hazard), in spite\nof scared squawking and mutter, after the fashion that lean-faced Rajah\ndealt with trapped heroes, once, in Calcutta. Dared you break the crust\nand bullyrag 'em--hot, fierce and angry, what wide beaks buzz plain\nSaxon as ever spoke Witenagemot! Yet, singing, they sing as no white\nbird does (where none rears phoenix) as near perfection as nature gets,\nor, if scowls bar platitude, notes for which there is no rejection in\nbanks whose coinage--oh, neat!--is gratitude.\"\n\nSaid, in the darkness, another enchanter:\n\n\"But far from their choiring the high King sat, in a gold-faced vest and\na gold-laced hat, counting heaped monies, and dreaming of more francs\nand sequins and Louis d'or. Meanwhile the Queen on that fateful night,\nthough avowing her lack of all appetite, was still at table, where,\nrumor said, she was smearing her seventh slice of bread (thus each\nturgescible rumor thrives at court) with gold from the royal hives.\nThrough the slumberous pare, under arching trees, to her labors went\nsinging the maid D\u00e9nise--\"\n\nA third broke in here, saying:\n\n\"And she sang of how subtle and bitter and bright was a beast brought\nforth, that was clad with the splendor and light of the cold fair ends\nof the north, like a fleshly blossom more white than augmenting tempests\nthat go, with thunder for weapon, to ravage the strait waste fastness of\nsnow. She sang how that all men on earth said, whether its mistress at\nmorn went forth or waited till night,--whether she strove through the\nfoam and wreckage of shallow and firth, or couched in glad fields of\ncorn, or fled from all human delight,--that thither it likewise would\nroam.\"\n\nNow a fourth began:\n\n\"Thus sang D\u00e9nise, what while the siccant sheets and coverlets that\npillowed kingly dreams, with curious undergarbs of royalty, she neatly\nranged: and dreamed not of that doom which waited, yet unborn, to strike\nmen dumb with perfect awe. As when the seventh wave poises, and sunlight\ncleaves it through and through with gold, as though to gild oncoming\ndeath for him that sees foredoomed--and, gasping, sees death high and\nsplendid!--while the tall wave bears down, and its shattering makes an\nend of him: thus poised the sable bird while one might count one, two,\nand three, and four, and five, and six, but hardly seven--\"\n\nSo they continued; but Manuel listened to no more. \"What is the meaning\nof all this?\" he asked, of Freydis.\n\n\"It is an experimental incantation,\" she replied, \"in that it is a bit\nof unfinished magic for which the proper words have not yet been found:\nbut between now and a while they will be stumbled on, and then this rune\nwill live perpetually, surviving all those rhymes that are infected with\nthought and intelligent meanings such as are repugnant to human nature.\"\n\n\"Are words, then, so important and enduring?\"\n\n\"Why, Manuel, I am surprised at you! In what else, pray, does man differ\nfrom the other animals except in that he is used by words?\"\n\n\"Now I would have said that words are used by men.\"\n\n\"There is give and take, of course, but in the main man is more\nsubservient to words than they are to him. Why, do you but think of such\nterrible words as religion and duty and love, and patriotism and art,\nand honor and common-sense, and of what these tyrannizing words do to\nand make of people!\"\n\n\"No, that is chop-logic: for words are only transitory noises, whereas\nman is the child of God, and has an immortal spirit.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, my dearest, I know you believe that, and I think it is\ndelightfully quaint and sweet of you. But, as I was saying, a man has\nonly the body of an animal to get experiences in, and the brain of an\nanimal to think them over with, so that the thoughts and opinions of the\npoor dear must remain always those of a more or less intelligent animal.\nBut his words are very often magic, as you will comprehend by and by when\nI have made you the greatest of image-makers.\"\n\n\"Well, well, but we can let that wait a bit,\" said Manuel.\n\nAnd thereafter Manuel talked with Freydis, confessing that the\nappearance of these magic-workers troubled Manuel. He had thought it, he\nsaid, an admirable thing to make images that lived, until he saw and\nconsidered the appearance of these habitual makers of images. They were\nan ugly and rickety, short-tempered tribe, said Manuel: they were\nshiftless, spiteful, untruthful, and in everyday affairs not far from\nimbecile: they plainly despised all persons who could not make images,\nand they apparently detested all those who could. With Manuel they were\nparticularly high and mighty, assuring him that he was only a prosperous\nand affected pseudo-magician, and that the harm done by the self-styled\nthaumaturgist was apt to be very great indeed. What sort of models,\nthen, were these insane, mud-moulding solitary wasps for a tall lad to\nfollow after? And if Manuel acquired their arts (he asked in\nconclusion), would he acquire their traits?\n\n\"The answer is perhaps no, and not impossibly yes,\" replied Freydis.\n\"For by the ancient Tuyla mystery they extract that which is best in\nthem to inform their images, and this is apt to leave them empty of\nvirtue. But I would have you consider that their best endures, whereas\nthat which is best in other persons is obliterated on some battle-field\nor mattress or gallows That is why I have been thinking that this\nafternoon--\"\n\n\"No, we will let that wait a bit, for I must turn this over in my mind,\"\nsaid Manuel, \"and my mature opinion about this matter must be expressed\nlater.\"\n\nBut while his thoughts were on the affair his fingers made him droll\nsmall images of ten of the image-makers, which he set aside unquickened.\nFreydis smiled at these caricatures, and asked when Manuel would give\nthem life.\n\n\"Oh, in due time,\" he said, \"and then their antics may be diverting. But\nI perceive that this old Tuyla magic is practised at great price and\ndanger, so that I am in no hurry to practise any more of it. I prefer to\nenjoy that which is dearer and better.\"\n\n\"And what can be dearer and better?\"\n\n\"Youth,\" Manuel answered, \"and you.\"\n\nQueen Freydis was now a human woman in all things, so this reply\ndelighted her hearing if not her reason. \"Do these two possessions\ncontent you, king of my heart?\" she asked him very fondly.\n\n\"No,\" Manuel said, gazing out across Morven at the cloud-dappled ridges\nof the Taunenfels, \"nor do I look ever to be contented in this world of\nmen.\"\n\n\"Indeed the run of men are poor thin-minded creatures, Manuel--\"\n\nHe answered, moodily:\n\n\"But I cannot put aside the thought that these men ought to be my\nfellows and my intimates. Instead, I who am a famed champion go daily in\ndistrust, almost in fear, of these incomprehensible and shatter-pated\nbeings. To every side there is a feeble madness over-busy about\nlong-faced nonsense from which I recoil, who must conceal this shrinking\nalways. There is no hour in my life but I go armored in reserve and in\nsmall lies, and in my armor I am lonely. Freydis, you protest deep love\nfor this well-armored Manuel, but what wisdom will reveal to you, or to\nme either, just what is Manuel? Oh, but I am puzzled by the impermanence\nand the loneliness and the impotence of this Manuel! Dear Freydis, do\nnot love my body nor my manner of speaking, nor any of the ways that I\nhave in the flesh, for all these transiencies are mortgaged to the\nworms. And that thought also is a grief--\"\n\n\"Let us not speak of these things! Let us not think of anything that is\nhorrid, but only of each other!\"\n\n\"But I cannot put aside the thought that I, who for the while exist in\nthis mortgaged body, cannot ever get out to you. Freydis, there is no\nway in which two persons may meet in this world of men: we can but\nexchange, from afar, despairing friendly signals, in the sure knowledge\nthey will be misinterpreted. So do we pass, each coming out of a strange\nwoman's womb, each parodied by the flesh of his parents, each passing\nfutilely, with incommunicative gestures, toward the womb of a strange\ngrave: and in this jostling we find no comradeship. No soul may travel\nupon a bridge of words. Indeed there is no word for my foiled huge\ndesire to love and to be loved, just as there is no word for the big,\nthe not quite comprehended thought which is moving in me at this moment.\nBut that thought also is a grief--\"\n\nManuel was still looking at the changing green and purple of the\nmountains and at the tall clouds trailing northward. The things that he\nviewed yonder were all gigantic and lovely, and they seemed not to be\nvery greatly bothering about humankind.\n\nThen Freydis said: \"Let us not think too much, dear, in our youth. It is\nsuch a waste of the glad time, and of the youth that will not ever be\nreturning--\"\n\n\"But I cannot put aside the thought that it will never be the true\nManuel whom you will love or even know of, nor can I dismiss the\nknowledge that these human senses, through which alone we may obtain any\nknowledge of each other, are lying messengers. What can I ever be to you\nexcept flesh and a voice? Nor is this the root of my sorrowing, dear\nFreydis. For I know that my distrust of all living creatures--oh, even\nof you, dear Freydis, when I draw you closest,--must always be as a wall\nbetween us, a low, lasting, firm-set wall which we can never pull down.\nAnd I know that I am not really a famed champion, but only a forlorn and\nlonely inmate of the doubtful castle of my body; and that I, who know\nnot truly what I am, must die in this same doubt and loneliness, behind\nthe strong defences of posturing and bluntness and jovial laughter which\nI have raised for my protecting. And that thought also is a grief.\"\n\nNow Manuel was as Freydis had not ever seen him. She wondered at him,\nshe was perturbed by this fine lad's incomprehensible dreariness, with\nsoft red willing lips so near: and her dark eyes were bent upon him with\na beautiful and tender yearning which may not be told.\n\n\"I do not understand you, my dearest,\" said she, who was no longer the\nhigh Queen of Audela, but a mortal woman. \"It is true that all the world\nabout us is a false seeming, but you and I are real and utterly united,\nfor we have no concealments from each other. I am sure that no two\npeople could be happier than we are, nor better suited. And certainly\nsuch morbid notions are not like you, who, as you said yourself, only\nthe other day, are naturally so frank and downright.\"\n\nNow Manuel's thoughts came back from the clouds and the green and purple\nof the mountains. He looked at her very gravely for an instant or two.\nHe laughed morosely. He said, \"There!\"\n\n\"But, dearest, you are strange and not yourself--\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" says Manuel, kissing her, \"for the moment I had forgotten to\nbe frank and downright, and all else which you expect of me. Now I am my\nold candid, jovial, blunt self again, and I shall not worry you with\nsuch silly notions any more. No, I am Manuel: I follow after my own\nthinking and my own desire; and if to do that begets loneliness I must\nendure it\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\n\nManuel Chooses\n\n\n\"But I cannot understand,\" said Freydis, on a fine day in September,\n\"how it is that, now the power of Schamir is in your control, and you\nhave the secret of giving life to your images, you do not care to use\neither the secret or the talisman. For you make no more images, you are\nalways saying, 'No, we will let that wait a bit,' and you do not even\nquicken the ten caricatures of the image-makers which you have already\nmodeled.\"\n\n\"Life will be given to these in due time,\" said Manuel, \"but that time\nis not yet come. Meanwhile, I avoid practise of the old Tuyla mystery\nfor the sufficing reason that I have seen the result it has on the\npractitioner. A geas was upon me to make a figure in the world, and so I\nmodeled and loaned life to such a splendid gay young champion as was to\nmy thinking and my desire. Thus my geas, I take it, is discharged, and a\nthing done has an end. Heaven may now excel me by creating a larger\nnumber of living figures than I, but pre-eminence in this matter is not\na question of arithmetic--\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, my squinting boy has all the virtues, including that of\nmodesty!\"\n\n\"Well, but I have seen my notion embodied, seen it take breath, seen it\ndepart from Morven in all respects, except for a little limping--which,\ndo you know, I thought rather graceful?--in well-nigh all respects, I\nrepeat, quite indistinguishable from the embodied notions of that master\ncraftsman whom some call Ptha, and others Jahveh, and others Abraxas,\nand yet others Koshchei the Deathless. In fine, I have made a figure\nmore admirable and significant than is the run of men, and I rest upon\nmy laurels.\"\n\n\"You have created a living being somewhat above the average, that is\ntrue: but then every woman who has a fine baby does just as much--\"\n\n\"The principle is not the same,\" said Manuel, with dignity.\n\n\"And why not, please, big boy?\"\n\n\"For one thing, my image was an original and unaided production, whereas\na baby, I am told, is the result of more or less hasty collaboration.\nThen, too a baby is largely chance work, in that its nature cannot be\nexactly foreplanned and pre-determined by its makers, who, in the glow\nof artistic creation, must, I imagine, very often fail to follow the\nbest aesthetic canons.\"\n\n\"As for that, nobody who makes new and unexampled things can make them\nexactly to the maker's will. Even your image limped, you remember--\"\n\n\"Ah, but so gracefully!\"\n\n\"--No, Manuel, it is only those necromancers who evoke the dead, and bid\nthe dead return to the warm flesh, that can be certain as to the results\nof their sorcery. For these alone of magic-workers know in advance what\nthey are making.\"\n\n\"Ah, this is news! So you think it is possible to evoke the dead in some\nmore tangible form than that of an instructive ghost? You think it\npossible for a dead girl--or, as to that matter, for a dead boy, or a\ndefunct archbishop, or a deceased ragpicker,--to be fetched back to live\nagain in the warm flesh?\"\n\n\"All things are possible, Manuel, at a price.\"\n\nSaid Manuel:\n\n\"What price would be sufficient to re-purchase the rich spoils of Death?\nand whence might any bribe be fetched? For all the glowing wealth and\nbeauty of this big round world must show as a new-minted farthing beside\nhis treasure chests, as one slight shining unimportant coin which--even\nthis also!--belongs to earth, but has been overlooked by him as yet.\nPresently this hour, and whatever is strutting through this hour, is\nadded to the heaped crypts wherein lie all that was worthiest in the old\ntime.\n\n\"Now there is garnered such might and loveliness and wisdom as human\nthinking cannot conceive of. An emperor is made much of here when he has\nconquered some part of the world, but Death makes nothing of a world of\nemperors: and in Death's crowded store-rooms nobody bothers to estimate\nwithin a thousand thousand of how many emperors, and tzars and popes and\npharaohs and sultans, that in their day were adored as omnipotent, are\nthere assembled pellmell, along with all that was worthiest in the old\ntime.\n\n\"As touches loveliness, not even Helen's beauty is distinguishable among\nthose multitudinous millions of resplendent queens whom one finds\nyonder. Here are many pretty women, here above all is Freydis, so I do\nnot complain. But yonder is deep-bosomed Semiramis, and fair-tressed\nGuenevere, and Magdalene that loved Christ, and Europa, the bull's\nlaughing bride, and Lilith, whose hot kiss made Satan ardent, and a many\nother ladies by whose dear beauty's might were shaped the songs which\ncause us to remember all that was worthiest in the old time.\n\n\"As wisdom goes, here we have prudent men of business able to add two\nand two together, and justice may be out of hand distinguished from\ninjustice by an impanelment of the nearest twelve fools. Here we have\nmany Helmases a-cackling wisely under a goose-feather. But yonder are\nCato and Nestor and Merlin and Socrates, Abelard sits with Aristotle\nthere, and the seven sages confer with the major prophets, and yonder is\nall that was worthiest in the old time.\n\n\"All, all, are put away in Death's heaped store-rooms, so safely put\naway that opulent Death may well grin scornfully at Life: for everything\nbelongs to Death, and Life is only a mendicant scratching at his sores\nso long as Death permits it. No, Freydis, there can be no bribing Death!\nFor what bribe anywhere has Life to offer which Death has not already\nlying disregarded in a thousand dusty coffers along with all that was\nworthiest in the old time?\"\n\nFreydis replied: \"One thing alone. Yes, Manuel, there is one thing only\nwhich all Death's ravishings have never taken from Life, and which has\nnot ever entered into Death's keeping. It is through weighing this fact,\nand through doing what else is requisite, that the very bold may bring\nback the dead to live again in the warm flesh.\"\n\n\"Well, but I have heard the histories of presumptuous men who attempted\nto perform such miracles, and all these persons sooner or later came to\nmisery.\"\n\n\"Why, to be sure! to whom else would you have them coming?\" said\nFreydis. And she explained the way it was.\n\nManuel put many questions. All that evening he was thoughtful, and he\nwas unusually tender with Freydis. And that night, when Freydis slept,\nDom Manuel kissed her very lightly, then blinked his eyes, and for a\nmoment covered them with his hand. Standing thus, the tall boy queerly\nmoving his mouth, as though it were stiff and he were trying to make it\nmore supple.\n\nThen he armed himself. He took up the black shield upon which was\npainted a silver stallion. He crept out of their modest magic home and\nwent down into Bellegarde, where he stole him a horse, from the stables\nof Duke Asmund.\n\nAnd that night, and all the next day, Dom Manuel rode beyond Aigremont\nand Naimes, journeying away from Morven, and away from the house of\njasper and porphyry and violet and yellow breccia, and away from\nFreydis, who had put off immortality for his kisses. He travelled\nnorthward, toward the high woods of Dun Vlechlan, where the leaves were\naglow with the funereal flames of autumn: for the summer wherein Dom\nManuel and Freydis had been happy together was now as dead as that\nestranged queer time which he had shared with Alianora.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\n\nThe Head of Misery\n\n\nWhen Manuel had reached the outskirts of the forest he encountered there\na knight in vermilion armor, with a woman's sleeve wreathed about his\nhelmet: and, first of all, this knight demanded who was Manuel's lady\nlove.\n\n\"I have no living love,\" said Manuel, \"except the woman whom I am\nleaving without ceremony, because it seems the only way to avoiding\nargument.\"\n\n\"But that is unchivalrous, and does not look well.\"\n\n\"Very probably you are right, but I am not chivalrous. I am Manuel. I\nfollow after my own thinking, and an obligation is upon me pointing\ntoward prompt employment of the knowledge I have gained from this\nwoman.\"\n\n\"You are a rascally betrayer of women, then, and an unmanly scoundrel.\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose so, for I betrayed another woman, in that I permitted\nand indeed assisted her to die in my stead; and so brought yet another\nbond upon myself, and an obligation which is drawing me from a homelike\nplace and from soft arms wherein I was content enough,\" says Manuel,\nsighing.\n\nBut the chivalrous adventurer in red armor was disgusted. \"Oh, you tall\nsquinting villain knight of the silver stallion, I wonder from whose\ncourt you can be coming, where they teach no better behavior than\nwoman-killing, and I wonder what foul new knavery you can be planning\nhere.\"\n\n\"Why, I was last in residence at Raymond B\u00e9renger's court,\" says Manuel:\n\"and since you are bent on knowing about my private affairs, I come to\nthis forest in search of B\u00e9da, or Kruchina, or whatever you call the\nMisery of earth in these parts.\"\n\n\"Aha, and are you one of Raymond B\u00e9renger's friends?\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose so,\" says Manuel, blinking,--\"yes, I suppose so, since I\nhave prevented his being poisoned.\"\n\n\"This is good hearing, for I have always been one of Raymond B\u00e9renger's\nenemies, and all such of his friends as I have encountered I have\nslain.\"\n\n\"Doubtless you have your reasons\", said Manuel, and would have ridden\nby.\n\nBut the other cried furiously, \"Turn, you tall fool! Turn, cowardly\nbetrayer of women!\"\n\nHe came upon Manuel like a whirlwind, and Manuel had no choice in the\nmatter. So they fought, and presently Manuel brought the vermilion\nknight to the ground, and, dismounting, killed him. It was noticeable\nthat from the death-wound came no blood, but only a flowing of very fine\nblack sand, out of which scrambled and hastily scampered away a small\nvermilion-colored mouse.\n\nThen Manuel said, \"I think that this must be the peculiarly irrational\npart of the forest, to which I was directed, and I wonder what may have\nbeen this scarlet squabbler's grievance against King Raymond B\u00e9renger?\"\n\nNobody answered, so Manuel remounted, and rode on.\n\nCount Manuel skirted the Wolflake, and came to a hut, painted gray, that\nstood clear of the ground, upon the bones of four great birds' feet.\nUpon the four corners of the hunt were carved severally the figures of a\nlion, a dragon, a cockatrice and an adder, to proclaim the miseries of\ncarnal and intellectual sin, and of pride, and of death.\n\nHere Manuel tethered his horse to a holm-oak. He raised both arms,\nfacing the East.\n\n\"Do you now speed me!\" cried Manuel, \"ye thirty Barami! O all ye powers\nof accumulated merit, O most high masters of Almsgiving, of Morality, of\nRelinquishment, of Wisdom, of Fortitude, of Patience, of Truth, of\nDetermination, of Charity, and of Equanimity! do all you aid me in my\nencounter with the Misery of earth!\"\n\nHe piously crossed himself, and went into the hut. Inside, the walls\nwere adorned with very old-looking frescoes that were equally innocent\nof perspective and reticence: the floor was of tessellated bronze. In\neach corner Manuel found, set upright, a many-storied umbrella of the\nkind used for sacred purposes in the East: each of these had a silver\nhandle, and was worked in nine colors. But most important of all, so\nManuel had been told, was the pumpkin which stood opposite to the\ndoorway.\n\nManuel kindled a fire, and prepared the proper kind of soup: and at\nsunset he went to the window of the hut, and cried out three times that\nsupper was ready.\n\nOne answered him, \"I am coming.\"\n\nManuel waited. There was now no sound in the forest: even the few birds\nnot yet gone south, that had been chirping of the day's adventures, were\nhushed on a sudden, and the breeze died in the tree-tops. Inside the hut\nManuel lighted his four candles, and he disposed of one under each\numbrella in the prescribed manner. His footsteps on the bronze flooring,\nand the rustling of his garments as he went about the hut doing what was\nrequisite, were surprisingly sharp and distinct noises in a vast silence\nand in an illimitable loneliness.\n\nThen said a thin little voice, \"Manuel, open the door!\"\n\nManuel obeyed, and you could see nobody anywhere in the forest's dusk.\nThe twilit brown and yellow trees were still as paintings. His horse\nstood tethered and quite motionless, except that it was shivering.\n\nOne spoke at his feet. \"Manuel, lift me over the threshold!\"\n\nDom Manuel, recoiling, looked downward, and in the patch of candlelight\nbetween the shadows of his legs you could see a human head. He raised\nthe head, and carried it into the hut. He could now perceive that the\nhead was made of white clay, and could deduce that the Misery of earth,\nwhom some call B\u00e9da, and others Kruchina, had come to him.\n\n\"Now, Manuel,\" says Misery, \"do you give me my supper.\"\n\nSo Manuel set the head upon the table, and put a platter of soup before\nthe head, and fed the soup to Misery with a gold spoon.\n\nWhen the head had supped, it bade Manuel place it in the little bamboo\ncradle, and told Manuel to put out the lights. Many persons would not\nhave fancied being alone in the dark with Misery, but Manuel obeyed. He\nknelt to begin his nightly prayer, but at once that happened which\ninduced him to desist. So without his usual divine invocation, Dom\nManuel lay down upon the bronze floor of the hut, beneath one of the\ntall umbrellas, and he rolled up his russet cloak for a pillow.\nPresently the head was snoring, and then Manuel too went to sleep. He\nsaid, later, that he dreamed of Niafer.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\n\nThe Month of Years\n\n\nIn the morning, after doing the head's extraordinary bidding, Manuel\nwent to feed his horse, and found tethered to the holm-oak the steed's\nskeleton picked clean. \"I grieve at this,\" said Manuel, \"but I consider\nit wiser to make no complaint.\" Indeed, there was nobody to complain to,\nfor Misery, after having been again lifted over the threshold, had\ndeparted to put in a day's labor with the plague in the north.\n\nThereafter Manuel abode in this peculiarly irrational part of the\nforest, serving Misery for, as men in cheerier places were estimating\nthe time, a month and a day. Of these services it is better not to\nspeak. But the head was pleased by Manuel's services, because Misery\nloves company: and the two used to have long friendly talks together\nwhen Manuel's services and Misery's work for that day were over.\n\n\"And how came you, sir, to be thus housed in a trunkless head?\" asked\nManuel, one time.\n\n\"Why, when Jahveh created man on the morning of the sixth day, he set\nabout fashioning me that afternoon from the clay which was left over.\nBut he was interrupted by the coming of the Sabbath, for Jahveh was in\nthose days, of course, a very orthodox Jew. So I was left incomplete,\nand must remain so always.\"\n\n\"I deduce that you, then, sir, are Heaven's last crowning work, and the\nfinal finishing touch to creation.\"\n\n\"So the pessimists tell me,\" the clay head assented, with a yawn. \"But I\nhave had a hard day of it, what with the pestilence in Glathion, and\nwars between the Emperor and the Milanese, and all those October colds,\nso we will talk no more philosophy.\"\n\nThus Manuel served the head of Misery, for a month of days and a day. It\nwas a noticeable peculiarity of this part of the forest--a peculiarity\nwell known to everybody, though not quite unanimously explained by the\nlearned,--that each day which one spent therein passed as a year, so\nthat Dom Manuel in appearance now aged rapidly. This was unfortunate,\nespecially when his teeth began to fail him, because there were no\ndentists handy, but his interest in the other Plagues which visited this\nforest left Manuel little time wherein to think about private worries.\nFor B\u00e9da was visited by many of his kindred, such as Mitlan and Kali and\nThragnar and Pwyll and Apepi and other evil principles, who were\nperpetually coming to the gray hut for family reunions, and to rehearse\nall but one of the two hundred and forty thousand spells of the Capuas.\nAnd it was at this time that Manuel got his first glimpse of Sclaug,\nwith whom he had such famous troubles later.\n\nSo sped the month of days that passed as years. Little is known as to\nwhat happened in the gray hut, but that perhaps is a good thing. Dom\nManuel never talked about it. This much is known, that all day the clay\nhead would be roving about the world, carrying envious reports, and\ndevouring kingdoms, and stirring up patriotism and reform, and\nwhispering malefic counsel, and bringing hurt and sorrow and despair and\nevil of every kind to men; and that in the evening, when at sunset\nPhobetor took over this lamentable work, B\u00e9da would return contentedly\nto Dun Vlechlan, for Manuel's services and a well-earned night's rest.\nOn most evenings there was unspeakable company, but none of these stayed\novernight. And after each night passed alone with Misery, the morning\nwould find Manuel older looking.\n\n\"I wonder, sir, at your callousness, and at the cheery way in which you\ngo about your dreadful business,\" said Manuel, once, after he had just\ncleansed the dripping jaws.\n\n\"Ah, but since I am all head and no heart, therefore I cannot well pity\nthe human beings whom I pursue as a matter of allotted duty.\"\n\n\"That seems plausible,\" says Manuel, \"and I perceive that if appearances\nare to be trusted you are not personally to blame. Still, I cannot but\nwonder why the world of men should thus be given over to Misery if\nKoshchei the Deathless, who made all things as they are, has any care\nfor men.\"\n\n\"As to what goes on overhead, Manuel, you must inquire of others. There\nare persons in charge, I know, but they have never yet permitted Misery\nto enter into their high places, for I am not popular with them, and\nthat is the truth.\"\n\n\"I can understand that, but nevertheless I wonder why Misery should have\nbeen created to feed upon mankind.\"\n\n\"Probably the cows and sheep and chickens in your barnyards, and the\npartridges and rabbits in your snares, and even the gasping fish upon\nyour hook, find time to wonder in the same way about you, Dom Manuel.\"\n\n\"Ah, but man is the higher form of life--\"\n\n\"Granting that remarkable assumption, and is any man above Misery? So\nyou see it is logical I should feed on you.\"\n\n\"Still, I believe that the Misery of earth was devised as a trial and a\ntesting to fit us for some nobler and eternal life hereafter.\"\n\n\"Why in this world should you think that?\" the head inquired, with real\ninterest.\n\n\"Because I have an immortal spirit, sir, and--\"\n\n\"Dear me, but all this is very remarkable. Where is it, Manuel?\"\n\n\"It is inside me somewhere, sir.\"\n\n\"Come, then, let us have it out, for I am curious to see it.\"\n\n\"No, it cannot get out exactly, sir, until I am dead.\"\n\n\"But what use will it be to you then?\" said Misery: \"and how can you,\nwho have not ever been dead, be certain as to what happens when one is\ndead?\"\n\n\"Well, I have always heard so, sir.\"\n\nThe head shook itself dubiously. \"Now from whom of the L\u00e9shy, I wonder,\ncan you have been hearing such fantastic stories? I am afraid somebody\nhas been making fun of you, Manuel.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, sir, this is a tenet held by the wisest and most admirable of\nmen.\"\n\n\"I see: it was some other man who told you all these drolleries about\nthe eternal importance of mankind,\" the head observed, with an\nunaccountable slackening of interest. \"I see: and again, you may notice\nthat the cows and the sheep and the chickens, also, resent extinction\nstrenuously.\"\n\n\"But these are creatures of the earth, sir, whereas there is about at\nany rate some persons a whiff of divinity. Come now, do you not find it\nso?\"\n\nThe head looked graver. \"Yes, Manuel, most young people have in them a\nspark which is divine, but it is living that snuffs this out of all of\nyou, by and large, without bothering Grandfather Death to unpeel spirits\nlike bananas. No, the most of you go with very little spirit, if any,\ninto the grave, and assuredly with not enough spirit to last you\nforever. No, Manuel, no, I never quarrel with religion, because it is\nalmost the strongest ally I have, but these religious notions rather\ndisgust me sometimes, for if men were immortal then Misery would be\nimmortal, and I could never survive that.\"\n\n\"Now you are talking nonsense, sir,\" said Manuel, stoutly, \"and of all\nsorts of nonsense cynical nonsense is the worst.\"\n\n\"By no means,\" replied the head, \"since, plainly, it is far worse\nnonsense to assert that omnipotence would insanely elect to pass\neternity with you humans. No, Manuel, I am afraid that your queer\ntheory, about your being stuffed inside with permanent material and so\non, does not very plausibly account for either your existence or mine,\nand that we both stay riddles without answers.\"\n\n\"Still, sir,\" said Manuel, \"inasmuch as there is one thing only which\nall death's ravishings have never taken from life, and that thing is the\nMisery of earth--\"\n\n\"Your premiss is indisputable, but what do you deduce from this?\"\n\nManuel smiled slowly and sleepily. \"I deduce, sir, that you, also, who\nhave not ever been dead, cannot possibly be certain as to what happens\nwhen one is dead. And so I shall stick to my own opinion about the life\nto come.\"\n\n\"But your opinion is absurd, on the face of it.\"\n\n\"That may very well be, sir, but it is much more comfortable to live\nwith than is your opinion, and living is my occupation just now. Dying I\nshall attend to in its due turn, and, of the two, my opinion is the more\npleasant to die with. Thereafter, if your opinion be right, I shall\nnever even know that my opinion was wrong: so that I have everything to\ngain, in the way of pleasurable anticipations anyhow, and I have nothing\nwhatever to lose, by clinging to the foolish fond old faith which my\nfathers had before me,\" said Manuel, as sturdily as ever.\n\n\"Yes, but how in this world--?\"\n\n\"Ah, sir,\" says Manuel, still smiling, \"in this world men are nourished\nby their beliefs; and it well may be that, yonder also, their sustenance\nis the same.\"\n\nBut at this moment came Reeri (a little crimson naked man, having the\nhead of a monkey) with his cock in one hand and his gnarled club in the\nother. Necessarily the Blood Demon's arrival put an end to their\ntalking, for that turn.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\n\nTouching Repayment\n\n\nSo Count Manuel's youth went out of him as he became more and more\nintimate with Misery, and an attachment sprang up between them, and the\ntwo took counsel as to all Manuel's affairs. They often talked of the\nroyal ladies whom Manuel had loved and loved no longer.\n\n\"For at one time,\" Manuel admitted, \"I certainly fancied myself in love\nwith the Princess Alianora, and at another time I was in love with Queen\nFreydis. And even now I like them well enough, but neither of these\nroyal ladies could make me forget the slave girl Niafer whom I loved on\nVraidex. Besides, the Princess and the Queen were fond of having their\nown way about everything, and they were bent on hampering me with power\nand wealth and lofty station and such other obstacles to the following\nof my own thinking and my own desires. I could not endure the eternal\narguing this led to, which was always reminding me, by contrast, of the\nquiet dear ways of Niafer and of the delight I had in the ways of\nNiafer. So it seemed best for everyone concerned for me to break off\nwith Freydis and Alianora.\"\n\n\"As for these women,\" the head estimated, \"you may be for some reasons\nwell rid of them. Yet this Alianora has fine eyes and certain powers.\"\n\n\"She is a princess of the Apsarasas,\" Manuel replied, \"and therefore she\nhas power over the butterflies and the birds and the bats, and over all\ncreatures of the air. I know, because she has disclosed to me some of\nthe secrets of the Apsarasas. But over her own tongue and temper the\nPrincess Alianora has no power and no control whatever, and if I had\nmarried her she would have eventually pestered me into being a king, and\ngiving my life over to politics and the dominion of men.\"\n\n\"This Freydis, too, has beautiful black hair--and certain powers--\"\n\n\"She was once Queen of Audela, and therefore she retains power over all\nfigures of earth. I know, because she has disclosed to me some of the\nsecrets of Audela. But the worst enemy of Freydis also goes in red, and\nis housed by the little white teeth of Freydis, for it was this enemy\nthat betrayed her: and if I had married her she would have coaxed me, by\nand by, into becoming a great maker of images, and giving my life over\nto such arts.\"\n\nMisery said: \"You have had love from these women, you have gained power\nand knowledge from these women. Therefore you leave them, to run after\nsome other woman who can give you no power and knowledge, but only a\nvast deal of trouble. It is not heroic, Manuel, but it is human, and\nyour reasoning is well fitted to your time of life.\"\n\n\"It is true that I am young as yet, sir--\"\n\n\"No, not so very young, for my society is maturing you, and already you\nare foreplanning and talking the follies of a man in middle life.\"\n\n\"No matter what my age may come to be, sir, I shall always remember that\nwhen I first set up as a champion, and was newly come from living\nmodestly in attendance upon the miller's pigs, I loved the slave girl\nNiafer. She died. I did not die. Instead, I relinquished Niafer to\nGrandfather Death, and at that price I preserved my own life and\nprocured a recipe through which I have prospered unbelievably, so that I\nam today a nobleman with fine clothes and lackeys, and with meadow-lands\nand castles of my own, if only I could obtain them. So I no longer go\nragged at the elbows, and royal ladies look upon me favorably, and I\nfind them well enough. But the joy I took in Niafer is not to be found\nin any of these things.\"\n\n\"That too is an old human story,\" the head said, \"and yours is a\ndelusion that comes to most men in middle life. However, for a month of\nyears you have served me faithfully, except for twice having failed to\nput enough venom in my soup, and for having forgotten to fetch in any\nice that evening the Old Black One was here. Still, nobody is perfect;\nyour time of service is out; and I must repay you as need is. Will you\nhave happiness, then, and an eternal severance between you and me?\"\n\n\"I have seen but one happy person,\" Manuel replied. \"He sat in a dry\nditch, displaying vacant glittering eyes, and straws were tangled in his\nhair, but Tom o' Bedlam was quite happy. No, it is not happiness I\ndesire.\"\n\nThe head repeated: \"You have served me. I repay, as need is, with the\npayment you demand. What is it you demand?\"\n\nDom Manuel said, \"I demand that Niafer who was a slave girl, and is now\na ghost in her pagan paradise.\"\n\n\"Do you think, then, that to recall the dead is possible?\"\n\n\"You are cunning, sir, but I remember what Freydis told me. Will you\nswear that Misery cannot bring back the dead?\"\n\n\"Very willingly I will swear to it, upon all the most authentic relics\nin Christendom.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, but will you rest one of your cold hard pointed ears\nagainst\"--here Manuel whispered what he did not care to name\naloud,--\"the while that you swear to it.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" Misery answered, sullenly: \"since every troubled ghost\nthat ever gibbered and clanked chains would rise confronting me if I\nmade such an oath. Yes, Manuel, I am able to bring back the dead, but\nprudence forces me to lie about my power, because to exercise that power\nto the full would be well-nigh as ruinous as the breaking of that\npumpkin. For there is only one way to bring back the dead in flesh, and\nif I follow that way I shall lose my head as all the others have done.\"\n\n\"What is that to a lover?\" says Manuel.\n\nThe head sighed, and bit at its white lips. \"An oath is an oath to the\nL\u00e9shy. Therefore do you, who are human, now make profitable use of the\nknowledge and of the power you get from those other women by breaking\noaths! And as you have served me, so will I serve you.\"\n\nManuel called black eagles to him, in the manner the Princess Alianora\nhad taught, and he sent them into all parts of the world for every sort\nof white earth. They obeyed the magic of the Apsarasas, and from Britain\nthey brought Dom Manuel the earth called leucargillon, and they brought\nglisomarga from Enisgarth, and eglecopala from the Gallic provinces, and\nargentaria from Lacre Kai, and white earth of every description from all\nparts of the world.\n\nManuel made from this earth, as Queen Freydis had taught him how to do,\nthe body of a woman. He fashioned the body peculiarly, in accordance\nwith the old Tuyla mystery, and the body was as perfect as Manuel could\nmake it, in all ways save that it had no head.\n\nThen Manuel sent a gold-crested wren into Provence: it entered through\nan upper window of the King's marmoreal palace, and went into the\nPrincess Alianora's chamber, and fetched hence a handkerchief figured\nwith yellow mulberries and wet with the tears which Alianora had shed in\nher grieving for Manuel. And Dom Manuel sent also a falcon, which\nreturned to him with Queen Freydis' handkerchief. That was figured with\nwhite fleurs-de-lis, and that too was drenched with tears.\n\nWhereupon, all being in readiness, Misery smiled craftily, and said:\n\n\"In the time that is passed I have overthrown high kings and prophets,\nand sorcerers also, as when Misery half carelessly made sport of\nMithridates and of Merlin and of Moses, in ways that ballad-singers\nstill delight to tell of. But with you, Dom Manuel, I shall deal\notherwise, and I shall disconcert you by and by in a more quiet fashion.\nHoh, I must grapple carefully with your love for Niafer, as with an\nantagonist who is not scrupulous, nor very sensible, but who is\nexceedingly strong. For observe: you obstinately desire this perished\nheathen woman, who in life, it well may be, was nothing remarkable.\nTherefore you have sought Misery, you have dwelt for a month of years\nwith terror, you have surrendered youth, you are planning to defy death,\nyou are intent to rob the deep grave and to despoil paradise. Truly your\nlove is great.\"\n\nManuel said only, \"An obligation is upon me, for the life of Niafer was\ngiven to preserve my life.\"\n\n\"Now I, whom some call B\u00e9da, and others Kruchina, and whom for the\npresent your love has conquered--I it is, alone, who can obtain for you\nthis woman, because in the long run I overcome all things and persons.\nLife is my province, and the birth cry of every infant is an oath of\nallegiance to me. Thus I am overlord where all serve willy-nilly except\nyou, who have served of your own will. And as you have served me, so\nmust I serve you.\"\n\nManuel said, \"That is well\"\n\n\"It is not so well as you think, for when you have this Niafer I shall\nreturn to you in the appearance of a light formless cloud, and I shall\nrise about you, not suddenly but a little by a little. So shall you see\nthrough me the woman for love of whom your living was once made\nhigh-hearted and fearless, and for whose sake death was derided, and\nparadise was ransacked: and you will ask forlornly, 'Was it for this?'\nThroughout the orderly, busied, unimportant hours that stretch between\nyour dressing for the day and your undressing for the night, you will be\nasking this question secretly in your heart, while I pass everywhither\nwith you in the appearance of a light formless cloud, and whisper to you\nsecretly.\"\n\n\"And what will you whisper to me?\"\n\n\"Not anything which you will care to repeat to anybody anywhere. Oh, you\nwill be able to endure it, and you will be content, as human contentment\ngoes, and my triumph will not be public. But, none the less, I shall\nhave overthrown my present conqueror, and I shall have brought low the\nlove which terror and death did not affright, and which the laws of\nearth could not control; and I, whom some call B\u00e9da, and others\nKruchina, will very terribly attest that the ghost of outlived and\nconquered misery is common-sense.\"\n\n\"That is to-morrow's affair,\" replied Dom Manuel \"To-day there is an\nobligation upon me, and my dealings are with to-day.\"\n\nThen Manuel bound the clay head of Misery in the two handkerchiefs which\nwere wet with the tears of Alianora and of Freydis. When the cock had\ncrowed three times, Dom Manuel unbound the head, and it was only a\nshapeless mass of white clay, because of the tears of Freydis and\nAlianora.\n\nManuel modeled in this clay, to the best of his ability, the head of\nNiafer, as he remembered her when they had loved each other upon\nVraidex: and after the white head was finished he fitted it to the body\nwhich he had made from the other kinds of white earth. Dom Manuel robed\nthis body in brown drugget such as Niafer had been used to wear in and\nabout the kitchen at Arnaye, and he did the other things that were\nrequisite, for this was the day of All Saints when nothing sacred ought\nto be neglected.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\nXXII\n\n\nReturn of Niafer\n\n\nNow the tale tells how Dom Manuel sat at the feet of the image and\nplayed upon a flageolet. There was wizardry in the music, Dom Manuel\nsaid afterward, for he declared that it evoked in him a vision and a\nrestless dreaming that followed after Misery.\n\nSo this dreaming showed that when Misery was dispossessed of the earth\nhe entered (because Misery is unchristian) into the paradise of the\npagans, where Niafer, dead now for something over a year, went\nrestlessly in bliss: and Misery came shortly afterward to Niafer, and\ntalked with her in a thin little voice. She listened willingly to this\ntalk of Manuel and of the adventures which Niafer had shared with\nManuel: and now that she remembered Manuel, and his clear young face and\nbright unequal eyes and his strong arms, she could no longer be even\nmoderately content in the paradise of the pagans.\n\nThereafter Misery went about the heathens' paradise in the appearance of\na light formless cloud. And the fields of this paradise seemed less\ngreen, the air became less pure and balmy, and the sky less radiant, and\nthe waters of the paradisal river Eridanus grew muddy. The poets became\ntired of hearing one another recite, the heroes lost delight in their\nwrestling and chariot racing and in their exercises with the spear and\nthe bow. \"How can anybody expect us to waste eternity with recreations\nwhich are only fitted to waste time?\" they demanded.\n\nAnd the lovely ladies began to find the handsome lovers with whom they\nwandered hand in hand through never-fading groves of myrtle, and with\nwhom they were forever reunited, rather tedious companions.\n\n\"I love you,\" said the lovers.\n\n\"You have been telling me that for twelve centuries,\" replied the\nladies, yawning, \"and too much of anything is enough.\"\n\n\"Upon my body, I think so too,\" declared the lovers. \"I said it only out\nof politeness and force of habit, and I can assure you I am as tired of\nthis lackadaisical idiocy as you are.\"\n\nSo everything was at sixes and sevens in this paradise: and when the\nmischief-maker was detected, the blessed held a meeting, for it was now\nthe day of All Souls, on which the dead have privilege.\n\n\"We must preserve appearances,\" said these dead pagans, \"and can have\nonly happy-looking persons hereabouts, for otherwise our paradise will\nget a poor name, and the religion of our fathers will fall into\ndisrepute.\"\n\nThen they thrust Misery, and Niafer also, out of the pagan paradise,\nbecause Misery clung to Niafer in the appearance of a light formless\ncloud, and there was no separating the two.\n\nThese two turned earthward together, and came to the river of sweat\ncalled Rigjon. Niafer said to the fiery angel Sandalfon that guards the\nbridge there, \"The Misery of earth is with me.\"\n\nSandalfon saw that this was so, and answered, \"My fires cannot consume\nthe Misery of earth.\"\n\nThey came to Hadarniel, the noisy angel whose, whispering is the\nthunder. Niafer said, \"The Misery of earth is with me.\"\n\nHadarniel replied, \"Before the Misery of earth I am silent.\"\n\nThey came to Kemuel and his twelve thousand angels of destruction that\nguard the outermost gateway. Niafer said, \"The Misery of earth is with\nme.\"\n\nKemuel answered, \"I ruin and make an end of all things else, but for the\nMisery of earth I have contrived no ending.\"\n\nSo Misery and Niafer passed all the warders of this paradise: and in a\ndim country on the world's rim the blended spirit of Misery and the\nghost of Niafer rose through a hole in the ground, like an imponderable\nvapor. They dissevered each from the other in a gray place overgrown\nwith poplars, and Misery cried farewell to Niafer.\n\n\"And very heartily do I thank you for your kindness, now that we part,\nand now that, it may be, I shall not ever see you again,\" said Niafer,\npolitely.\n\nMisery replied:\n\n\"Take no fear for not seeing me again, now that you are about once more\nto become human. Certainly, Niafer, I must leave you for a little while,\nbut certainly I shall return. There will first be for you much kissing\nand soft laughter, and the quiet happy ordering of your home, and the\nheart-shaking wonder of the child who is neither you nor Manuel, but\nboth of you, and whose life was not ever seen before on earth: and life\nwill burgeon with white miracles, and every blossom you will take to be\neternal. Laughing, you will say of sorrow, 'What is it?' And I, whom\nsome call B\u00e9da, and others call Kruchina, shall be monstrously amused by\nthis.\n\n\"Then your seeing will have my help, and you will observe that Manuel is\nvery much like other persons. He will be used to having you about, and\nyou him, and that will be the sorry bond between you. The children that\nhave reft their flesh from your flesh ruthlessly, and that have derived\ntheir living from your glad anguish, each day will, be appearing a\nlittle less intimately yours, until these children find their mates.\nThereafter you will be a tolerated intruder into these children's daily\nliving, and nobody anywhere will do more than condone your coming: you\nwill weep secretly: and I, whom some call B\u00e9da, and others call\nKruchina, shall be monstrously amused by this.\n\n\"Then I shall certainly return to you, when your tears are dried, and\nwhen you no longer believe what young Niafer once believed; and when,\nremembering young Niafer's desires and her intentions as to the disposal\nof her life, you will shrug withered shoulders. To go on living will\nremain desirable. The dilapidations of life will no longer move you\ndeeply. Shrugging, you will say of sorrow, 'What is it?' for you will\nknow grief also to be impermanent. And your inability to be quite\nmiserable any more will assure you that your goings are attended by the\nghost of outlived and conquered misery: and I, whom some call B\u00e9da, and\nothers call Kruchina, shall be monstrously amused by this.\"\n\nSaid Niafer, impatiently, \"Do you intend to keep me here forever under\nthese dark twinkling trees, with your thin little talking, while Manuel\nstays unhappy through his want of me?\"\n\nAnd Misery answered nothing as he departed from Niafer, for a season.\n\nSuch were the happenings in the vision witnessed by Dom Manuel (as Dom\nManuel afterward declared) while he sat playing upon the flageolet.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\nManuel Gets His Desire\n\n\nNow the tale tells that all this while, near the gray hut in Dun\nVlechlan, the earthen image of Niafer lay drying out in the November\nsun; and that gray Dom Manuel--no longer the florid boy who had come\ninto Dun Vlechlan,--sat at the feet of the image, and played upon a\nflageolet the air which Suskind had taught him, and with which he had\nbeen used to call young Suskind from her twilit places when Manuel was a\npeasant tending swine. Now Manuel was an aging nobleman, and Niafer was\nnow a homeless ghost, but the tune had power over them, none the less,\nfor its burden was young love and the high-hearted time of youth; so\nthat the melody which once had summoned Suskind from her low\nred-pillared palace in the doubtful twilight, now summoned Niafer\nresistlessly from paradise, as Manuel thriftily made use of the odds and\nends which he had learned from three women to win him a fourth woman.\n\nThe spirit of Niafer entered at the mouth of the image. Instantly the\nhead sneezed, and said, \"I am unhappy.\" But Manuel kept on playing. The\nspirit descended further, bringing life to the lungs and the belly, so\nthat the image then cried, \"I am hungry.\" But Manuel kept on playing. So\nthe soul was drawn further and further, until Manuel saw that the white\nimage had taken on the colors of flesh, and was moving its toes in time\nto his playing; and so knew that the entire body was informed with life.\n\nHe cast down the flageolet, and touched the breast of the image with the\nancient formal gestures of the old Tuyla mystery, and he sealed the\nmouth of the image with a kiss, so that the spirit of Niafer was\nimprisoned in the image which Manuel had made. Under his lips the lips\nwhich had been Misery's cried, \"I love.\" And Niafer rose, a living girl\njust such as Manuel had remembered for more than a whole year: but with\nthat kiss all memories of paradise and all the traits of angelhood\ndeparted from her.\n\n\"Well, well, dear snip,\" said Manuel, the first thing of all, \"now it is\ncertainly a comfort to have you back again.\"\n\nNiafer, even in the rapture of her happiness, found this an\nunimpassioned greeting from one who had gone to unusual lengths to\nrecover her companionship. Staring, she saw that Manuel had all the\nmarks of a man in middle life, and spoke as became appearances. For it\nwas at the price of his youth that Manuel had recovered the woman whom\nhis youth desired: and Misery had subtly evened matters by awarding an\naging man the woman for whose sake a lad had fearlessly served Misery.\nThere was no longer any such lad, for the conquered had destroyed the\nconqueror.\n\nThen, after a moment's consideration of this tall gray stranger, Niafer\nalso looked graver and older. Niafer asked for a mirror: and Manuel had\nnone.\n\n\"Now but certainly I must know at once just how faithfully you have\nremembered me,\" says Niafer.\n\nHe led the way into the naked and desolate November forest, and they\ncame to the steel-colored Wolflake hard by the gray hut: and Niafer\nfound she was limping, for Manuel had not got her legs quite right, so\nthat for the rest of her second life she was lame. Then Niafer gazed for\na minute, or it might be for two minutes, at her reflection in the deep\ncold waters of the Wolflake.\n\n\"Is this as near as you have come to remembering me, my dearest!\" she\nsaid, dejectedly, as she looked down at Manuel's notion of her face. For\nthe appearance which Niafer now wore she found to be very little like\nthat which Niafer remembered as having been hers, in days wherein she\nhad been tolerably familiar with the Lady Gis\u00e8le's mirrors; and it was a\ngrief to Niafer to see how utterly the dearest dead go out of mind in no\nlong while.\n\n\"I have forgotten not one line or curve of your features,\" says Manuel,\nstoutly, \"in all these months, nor in any of these last days that have\npassed as years. And when my love spurred me to make your image, Niafer,\nmy love loaned me unwonted cunning. Even by ordinary, they tell me, I\nhave some skill at making images: and while not for a moment would I\nseem to boast of that skill, and not for worlds would I annoy you by\nrepeating any of the complimentary things which have been said about my\nimages,--by persons somewhat more appreciative, my dear, of the toil and\ncare that goes to work of this sort,--I certainly think that in this\ninstance nobody has fair reason to complain.\"\n\nShe looked at his face now: and she noted what the month of living with\nB\u00e9da, with whom a day is as a year, had done to the boy's face which she\nremembered. Count Manuel's face was of remodeled stuff: youth had gone\nout of it, and the month of years had etched wrinkles in it, success had\nhardened and caution had pinched and self-complacency had kissed it. And\nNiafer sighed again, as they sat reunited under leafless trees by the\nsteel-colored Wolflake.\n\n\"There is no circumventing time and death, then, after all,\" said\nNiafer, \"for neither of us is now the person that ascended Vraidex. No\nmatter: I love you, Manuel, and I am content with what remains of you:\nand if the body you have given me is to your will it is to my will.\"\n\nBut now three rascally tall ragged fellows, each blind in one eye, and\neach having a thin peaked beard, came into the opening before the gray\nhut, trampling the dead leaves there as they shouted for Mimir. \"Come\nout!\" they cried: \"come out, you miserable Mirmir, and face those three\nwhom you have wronged!\"\n\nDom Manuel rose from the bank of the Wolflake, and went toward the\nshouters. \"There is no Mimir,\" he told them, \"in Dun Vlechlan, or not at\nleast in this peculiarly irrational part of the forest.\"\n\n\"You lie,\" they said, \"for even though you have hitched a body to your\nhead we recognize you.\" They looked at Niafer, and all three laughed\ncruelly. \"Was it for this hunched, draggled, mud-faced wench that you\nleft us, you squinting old villain? And have you so soon forgotten the\nvintner's parlor at Neogr\u00e9ant, and what you did with the gold plates?\"\n\n\"No, I have not forgotten these things, for I never knew anything about\nthem,\" said Manuel.\n\nSaid one of the knaves, twirling fiercely his moustachios: \"Hah,\nshameless Mimir, do you look at me, who have known you and your blind\nson Oriander, too, to be unblushing knaves for these nine centuries!\nNow, I suppose, you will be denying the affair of the squirrel also?\"\n\n\"Oh, be off with your nonsense!\" says Manuel, \"for I have not yet had\ntwenty-two years of living, and I never saw you before, and I hope never\nto see you again.\"\n\nBut they all set upon him with cutlasses, so there was nothing remaining\nsave to have out his sword and fight. And when each of these one-eyed\npersons had vanished curiously under his death-wound, Manuel told Niafer\nit was a comfort to find that the month of years had left him a fair\nswordsman for all that his youth was gone; and that he thought they had\nbetter be leaving this part of the high woods of Dun Vlechlan, wherein\nunaccountable things took place, and all persons behaved unreasonably.\n\n\"Were these wood-spirits unreasonable,\" asks Niafer, \"in saying that the\ncountenance and the body you have given me are ugly?\"\n\n\"My dear,\" replied Manuel, \"it was their saying that which made me try\nto avoid the conflict, because it does not look well, not even in\ndealing with demons, to injure the insane.\"\n\n\"Manuel, and can it be you who are considering appearances?\"\n\nDom Manuel said gravely: \"My dealings with Misery and with Misery's\nkindred have taught me many things which I shall never forget nor very\nwillingly talk about. One of these teachings, though, is that in most\naffairs there is a middle road on which there is little traffic and\ncomparatively easy going. I must tell you that the company I have been\nin required a great deal of humoring, for of course it is not safe to\ntrifle with any evil principle. No, no, one need not absolutely and\nopenly defy convention, I perceive, in order to follow after one's own\nthinking,\" says Manuel, shrewdly, and waggling a gray beard.\n\n\"I am so glad you have learned that at last! At least, I suppose, I am\nglad,\" said Niafer, a little wistfully, as she recalled young Manuel of\nthe high head.\n\n\"But, as I was saying, I now estimate that these tattered persons who\nwould have prevented my leaving, as well as the red fellow that would\nhave hindered my entering, this peculiarly irrational part of the\nforest, were spiritual intruders into Misery's domain whom Misery had\ndriven out of their wits. No, Niafer, I voice no criticism, because with\nus two this Misery of earth, whom some call B\u00e9da, and others Kruchina,\nhas dealt very handsomely. It troubles me to suspect that he was also\ncalled Mimir; but of this we need not speak, because a thing done has an\nend, even a killed grandfather. Nevertheless, I think that Dun Vlechlan\nis unwholesome, and I am of the opinion that you and I will be more\ncomfortable elsewhere.\"\n\n\"But must we go back to looking after pigs, dear Manuel, or are you now\ntoo old for that?\"\n\nDom Manuel smiled, and you saw that he retained at least his former\nlordliness. \"No, now that every obligation is lifted, and we are\nreunited, dear snip, I can at last go traveling everywhither, so that I\nmay see the ends of this world and judge them. And we will do whatever\nelse we choose, for, as I must tell you, I am now a nobleman with\nlackeys and meadowlands and castles of my own, if only I could obtain\npossession of them.\"\n\n\"This is excellent hearing,\" said Niafer, \"and much better than\npig-stealing, and I am glad that the world has had sense enough to\nappreciate you, Manuel, and you it. And we will have rubies in my\ncoronet, because I always fancied them. Now do you tell me how it all\nhappened, and what I am to be called countess of. And we will talk about\nthat traveling later, for I have already traveled a great distance\ntoday, but we must certainly have rubies.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\n\nThree Women\n\n\nSo Manuel put on his armor, and with Manuel telling as much as he\nthought wise of the adventures which he had encountered while Niafer was\ndead, they left this peculiarly irrational part of the forest, and fared\nout of the ruined November woods; and presently, in those barren fields\nthat descend toward the sand dunes of Quentavic, came face to face with\nQueen Freydis and the Princess Alianora, where these two royal ladies\nand many other fine people rode toward the coast.\n\nAlianora went magnificently this morning, on a white horse, and wearing\na kirtle of changeable green like the sea's green in sunlight: her\ngolden hair was bound with a gold frontlet wherein were emeralds.\nFreydis, dark and stately, was in crimson embroidered with small gold\nstars and ink-horns: a hooded falcon sat on her gloved wrist.\n\nNow Freydis and Alianora stared at the swarthy, flat-faced, limping\npeasant girl in brown drugget that was with Count Manuel. Then Alianora\nstared at Freydis.\n\n\"Is it for this dingy cripple,\" says Alianora, with her proud fine face\nall wonder, \"that Dom Manuel has forsaken us and has put off his youth?\nWhy, the girl is out and out ugly!\"\n\n\"Our case is none the better for that,\" replied Freydis, the wise Queen,\nwhose gazing rested not upon Niafer but on Manuel.\n\n\"Who are those disreputable looking, bold-faced creatures that are\nmaking eyes at you?\" says Niafer.\n\nAnd Manuel, marveling to meet these two sorceresses together, replied,\nas he civilly saluted them from a little distance, \"Two royal ladies,\nwho would be well enough were it not for their fondness for having their\nown way.\"\n\n\"And I suppose you think them handsome!\"\n\n\"Yes, Niafer, I find them very beautiful. But after looking at them with\naesthetic pleasure, my gaze returns adoringly to the face I have created\nas I willed, and to the quiet love of my youth, and I have no occasion\nto be thinking of queens and princesses. Instead, I give thanks in my\nheart that I am faring contentedly toward the nearest priest with the\none woman in the world who to my finding is desirable and lovely.\"\n\n\"It is very sweet of you to say that, Manuel, and I am sure I hope you\nare telling the truth, but my faith would be greater if you had not\nrattled it off so glibly.\"\n\nThen Alianora said: \"Greetings, and for the while farewell, to you,\nCount Manuel! For all we ride to Quentavic, and thence I am passing over\ninto England to marry the King of that island.\"\n\n\"Now, but there is a lucky monarch for you!\" says Manuel, politely. He\nlooked at Freydis, who had put off immortality for his kisses, and whom\nhe had deserted to follow after his own thinking: these re-encounters\nare always awkward, and Dom Manuel fidgeted a little. He asked her, \"And\ndo you also go into England?\"\n\nShe told him very quietly, no, that she was only going to the coast, to\nconsult with three or four of the water-demons about enchanting one of\nthe Red Islands, and about making her home there. She had virtually\ndecided, she told him, to put a spell upon Sargyll, as it seemed the\nmost desirable of these islands from what she could hear, but she must\nfirst see the place. Queen Freydis looked at him with rather\nembarrassing intentness all the while, but she spoke quite calmly.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" Dom Manuel said, cordially, \"I dare say you will be very\ncomfortable there, and I am sure I hope so. But I did not know that you\ntwo ladies were acquainted.\"\n\n\"Indeed, our affairs are not your affairs,\" says Freydis, \"any longer.\nAnd what does it matter, on this November day which has a thin sunlight\nand no heat at all in it? No, that girl yonder has to-day. But Alianora\nand I had each her yesterday; and it may be the one or it may be the\nother of us three who will have to-morrow, and it may be also that the\ndisposal of that to-morrow will be remarkable.\"\n\n\"Very certainly,\" declared Alianora, with that slow, lovely, tranquil\nsmile of hers, \"I shall have my portion of to-morrow. I would have made\nyou a king, and by and by the most powerful of all kings, but you\nfollowed after your own thinking, and cared more for messing in wet mud\nthan for a throne. Still, this nonsense of yours has converted you into\na rather distinguished looking old gentleman, so when I need you I shall\nsummon you, with the token that we know of, Dom Manuel, and then do you\ncome post-haste!\"\n\nFreydis said: \"I would have made you the greatest of image-makers; but\nyou followed after your own thinking, and instead of creating new and\ngod-like beings you preferred to resurrect a dead servant girl.\nNevertheless, do I bid you beware of the one living image you made, for\nit still lives and it alone you cannot ever shut out from your barred\nheart, Dom Manuel: and nevertheless, do I bid you come to me, Dom Manuel,\nwhen you need me.\"\n\nManuel replied, \"I shall always obey both of you.\" Niafer throughout\nthis while said nothing at all. But she had her private thoughts, to the\neffect that neither of these high-and-mighty trollops was in reality the\nperson whom henceforward Dom Manuel was going to obey.\n\nSo the horns sounded. The gay cavalcade rode on, toward Quentavic. And\nas they went young Osmund Heleigh (Lord Brudenel's son) asked for the\ngallant King of Navarre, \"But who, sire, was that time-battered gray\nvagabond, with the tarnished silver stallion upon his shield and the\nmud-colored cripple at his side, that our Queens should be stopping for\nany conference with him?\"\n\nKing Thibaut said it was the famous Dom Manuel of Poictesme, who had put\naway his youth for the sake of the girl that was with him.\n\n\"Then is the old man a fool on every count,\" declared Messire Heleigh,\nsighing, \"for I have heard of his earlier antics in Provence, and no\nlovelier lady breathes than Dame Alianora.\"\n\n\"I consider Queen Freydis to be the handsomer of the two,\" replied\nThibaut, \"but certainly there is no comparing either of these\ninestimable ladies with Dom Manuel's swarthy drab.\"\n\n\"She is perhaps some witch whose magic is more terrible than their\nmagic, and has besotted this ruined champion?\"\n\n\"It is either enchantment or idiocy, unless indeed it be something far\nhigher than either.\" King Thibaut looked grave, then shrugged. \"Oy\nDieus! even so, Queen Freydis is the more to my taste.\"\n\nThus speaking, the young King spurred his bay horse toward Queen Freydis\n(from whom he got his ruin a little later), and all Alianora's retinue\nwent westward, very royally, while Manuel and Niafer trudged east. Much\ncolor and much laughter went one way, but the other way went\ncontentment, for that while.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nPART FOUR\n\n\nTHE BOOK OF SURCHARGE\n\n\nTO\n\nHUGH WALPOLE\n\n\n\n\nSoe _Manuel made all the Goddes that we call_ mamettes _and_ ydolles,\n_that were sett ouer the Subiection of his lyfe tyme: and euery of the\ngoddes that Manuel wolde carue toilesomelie hadde in hys Bodie a\nBlemmishe; and in the mydle of the godes made he one god of the\nPhilistines._\n\n\n\nXXV\n\n\nAffairs in Poictesme\n\n\nThey of Poictesme narrate how Manuel and Niafer traveled east a little\nway and then turned toward the warm South; and how they found a priest\nto marry them, and how Manuel confiscated two horses. They tell also how\nManuel victoriously encountered a rather terrible dragon at La Fl\u00e8che,\nand near Orthez had trouble with a Groach, whom he conquered and\nimprisoned in a leather bottle, but they say that otherwise the journey\nwas uneventful.\n\n\"And now that every obligation is lifted, and we are reunited, my dear\nNiafer,\" says Manuel, as they sat resting after his fight with the\ndragon, \"we will, I repeat, be traveling every whither, so that we may\nsee the ends of this world and may judge them.\"\n\n\"Dearest,\" replied Niafer, \"I have been thinking about that, and I am\nsure it would be delightful, if only people were not so perfectly\nhorrid.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, dear snip?\"\n\n\"You see, Manuel, now that you have fetched me back from paradise,\npeople will be saying you ought to give me, in exchange for the abodes\nof bliss from which I have been summoned, at least a fairly comfortable\nand permanent terrestrial residence. Yes, dearest, you know what people\nare, and the evil-minded will be only too delighted to be saying\neverywhere that you are neglecting an obvious duty if you go wandering\noff to see and judge the ends of this world, with which, after all, you\nhave really no especial concern.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, and if they do?\" says Manuel, shrugging lordily. \"There is no\nhurt in talking.\"\n\n\"Yes, Manuel, but such shiftless wandering, into uncomfortable places\nthat nobody ever heard of, would have that appearance. Now there is\nnothing I would more thoroughly enjoy then to go traveling about at\nadventure with you, and to be a countess means nothing whatever to me. I\nam sure I do not in the least care to live in a palace of my own, and be\nbothered with fine clothes and the responsibility of looking after my\nrubies, and with servants and parties every day. But you see, darling, I\nsimply could not bear to have people thinking ill of my dear husband,\nand so, rather than have that happen, I am willing to put up with these\nthings.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" says Manuel, and he began pulling vexedly at his little gray\nbeard, \"and does one obligation beget another as fast as this! Now\nwhatever would you have me do?\"\n\n\"Obviously, you must get troops from King Ferdinand, and drive that\nawful Asmund out of Poictesme.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" says Manuel, \"but what a simple matter you make of it! Shall\nI attend to it this afternoon?\"\n\n\"Now, Manuel, you speak without thinking, for you could not possibly\nre-conquer all Poictesme this afternoon--.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" says Manuel.\n\n\"No, not single-handed, my darling. You would first have to get troops\nto help you, both horse and foot.\"\n\n\"My dearest, I only meant--\"\n\n\"--Even then, it will probably take quite a while to kill off all the\nNorthmen.\"\n\n\"Niafer, will you let me explain--\"\n\n\"--Besides, you are miles away from Poictesme. You could not even manage\nto get there this afternoon.\"\n\nManuel put his hand over her mouth. \"Niafer, when I spoke of subjugating\nPoictesme this afternoon I was attempting a mild joke. I will never any\nmore attempt light irony in your presence, for I perceive that you do\nnot appreciate my humor. Meanwhile I repeat to you, No, no, a thousand\ntimes, no! To be called Count of Poictesme sounds well, it strokes the\nhearing: but I will not be set to root and vegetate in a few hundred\nspadefuls of dirt. No, for I have but one lifetime here, and in that\nlifetime I mean to see this world and all the ends of this world, that I\nmay judge them. And I,\" he concluded, decisively, \"am Manuel, who follow\nafter my own thinking and my own desire.\"\n\nNiafer began to weep. \"I simply cannot bear to think of what people will\nsay of you.\"\n\n\"Come, come, my dear,\" says Manuel, \"this is preposterous.\"\n\nNiafer wept.\n\n\"You will only end by making yourself ill!\" says Manuel.\n\nNiafer continued to weep.\n\n\"My mind is quite made up,\" says Manuel, \"so what, in God's name, is the\ngood of this?\"\n\nNiafer now wept more and more broken-heartedly. And the big champion sat\nlooking at her, and his broad shoulders relaxed. He viciously kicked at\nthe heavy glistening green head of the dragon, still bleeding uglily\nthere at his feet, but that did no good whatever. The dragon-queller was\nbeaten. He could do nothing against such moisture, his resolution was\ndampened and his independence was washed away by this salt flood. And\nthey say too that, now his youth was gone, Dom Manuel began to think of\nquietness and of soft living more resignedly than he acknowledged.\n\n\"Very well, then,\" Manuel says, by and by, \"let us cross the Loir, and\nride south to look for our infernal coronet with the rubies in it, and\nfor your servants, and for some of your palaces.\"\n\nSo in the Christmas holidays they bring a tall burly squinting\ngray-haired warrior to King Ferdinand, in a lemon grove behind the royal\npalace. Here the sainted King, duly equipped with his halo and his\ngoose-feather, was used to perform the lesser miracles on Wednesdays and\nSaturdays.\n\nThe King was delighted by the change in Manuel's looks, and said that\nexperience and maturity were fine things to be suggested by the\nappearance of a nobleman in Manuel's position. But, a pest! as for\ngiving him any troops with which to conquer Poictesme, that was quite\nanother matter. The King needed his own soldiers for his own ends, which\nnecessitated the immediate capture of Cordova. Meanwhile here were the\nPrince de G\u00e2tinais and the Marquess di Paz, who also had come with this\ninsane request, the one for soldiers to help him against the\nPhilistines, and the other against the Catalans.\n\n\"Everybody to whom I ever granted a fief seems to need troops nowadays,\"\nthe King grumbled, \"and if any one of you had any judgment whatever you\nwould have retained your lands once they were given you.\"\n\n\"Our deficiencies, sire,\" says the young Prince de G\u00e2tinais, with\nconsiderable spirit, \"have not been altogether in judgment, but rather\nin the support afforded us by our liege-lord.\"\n\nThis was perfectly true; but inasmuch as such blunt truths are not\nusually flung at a king and a saint, now Ferdinand's thin brows went up.\n\n\"Do you think so?\" said the King. \"We must see about it. What is that,\nfor example?\"\n\nHe pointed to the pool by which the lemon-trees were watered, and the\nPrince glanced at the yellow object afloat in this pool. \"Sire,\" said de\nG\u00e2tinais, \"it is a lemon which has fallen from one of the trees.\"\n\n\"So you judge it to be a lemon. And what do you make of it, di Paz?\" the\nKing inquired.\n\nThe Marquess was a statesman who took few chances. He walked to the edge\nof the pool, and looked at the thing before committing himself: and he\ncame back smiling. \"Ah, sire, you have indeed contrived a cunning sermon\nagainst hasty judgment, for, while the tree is a lemon-tree, the thing\nthat floats beneath it is an orange.\"\n\n\"So you, Marquess, judge it to be an orange. And what do you make of it,\nCount of Poictesme?\" the King asks now.\n\nIf di Paz took few chances, Manuel took none at all. He waded into the\npool, and fetched out the thing which floated there. \"King,\" says big\nDom Manuel, sagely blinking his bright pale eyes, \"it is the half of an\norange.\"\n\nSaid the King: \"Here is a man who is not lightly deceived by the vain\nshows of this world, and who values truth more than dry shoes. Count\nManuel, you shall have your troops, and you others must wait until you\nhave acquired Count Manuel's powers of judgment, which, let me tell you,\nare more valuable than any fief I have to give.\"\n\nSo when the spring had opened, Manuel went into Poictesme at the head of\na very creditable army, and Dom Manuel summoned Duke Asmund to surrender\nall that country. Asmund, who was habitually peevish under the puckerel\ncurse, refused with opprobrious epithets, and the fighting began.\n\nManuel had, of course, no knowledge of generalship, but King Ferdinand\nsent the Conde de Tohil Vaca as Manuel's lieutenant. Manuel now figured\nimposingly in jeweled armor, and the sight of his shield bearing the\nrampant stallion and the motto _Mundus vult decipi_ became in battle a\nsignal for the more prudent among his adversaries to distinguish\nthemselves in some other part of the conflict. It was whispered by\nbackbiters that in counsel and in public discourse Dom Manuel sonorously\nrepeated the orders and opinions provided by Tohil Vaca: either way, the\nofficial utterances of the Count of Poictesme roused everywhere the\nkindly feeling which one reserves for old friends, so that no harm was\ndone.\n\nTo the contrary, Dom Manuel now developed an invaluable gift for public\nspeaking, and in every place which he conquered and occupied he made\npowerful addresses to the surviving inhabitants before he had them\nhanged, exhorting all right-thinking persons to crush the military\nautocracy of Asmund. Besides, as Manuel pointed out, this was a struggle\nsuch as the world had never known, in that it was a war to end war\nforever, and to ensure eternal peace for everybody's children. Never, as\nhe put it forcefully, had men fought for a more glorious cause. And so\non and go on, said he, and these uplifting thoughts had a fine effect\nupon everyone.\n\n\"How wonderfully you speak!\" Dame Niafer would say admiringly.\n\nAnd Manuel would look at her queerly, and reply: \"I am earning your\nhome, my dear, and your servants' wages, and some day these verbal\njewels will be perpetuated in a real coronet. For I perceive that a\nformer acquaintance of mine was right in pointing out the difference\nbetween men and the other animals.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, indeed!\" said Niafer, very gravely, and not attaching any\nparticular meaning to it, but generally gathering that she and Manuel\nwere talking about something edifying and pious. For Niafer was now a\ndevout Christian, as became a Countess of Poictesme, and nobody anywhere\nentertained a more sincere reverence for solemn noises.\n\n\"For instance,\" Dame Niafer continued, \"they tell me that these lovely\nspeeches of yours have produced such an effect upon the Philistines\nyonder that their Queen Stultitia has proffered an alliance, and has\npromised to send you light cavalry and battering-rams.\"\n\n\"It is true she has promised to send them, but she has not done so.\"\n\n\"None the less, Manuel, you will find that the moral effect of her\napprobation will be invaluable; and, as I so often think, that is the\nmain thing after all--\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" says Manuel, impatiently, \"we have plenty of moral\napprobation and fine speaking here, and in the South we have a saint to\nwork miracles for us, but it is Asmund who has that army of splendid\nreprobates, and they do not value morality and rhetoric the worth of an\nold finger-nail.\"\n\nSo the fighting continued throughout that spring, and in Poictesme it\nall seemed very important and unexampled, just as wars usually appear to\nthe people that are engaged in them. Thousands of men were slain, to the\nregret of their mothers and sweethearts, and very often of their wives.\nAnd there was the ordinary amount of unparalleled military atrocities\nand perfidies and ravishments and burnings and so on, and the endurers\ntook their agonies so seriously that it is droll to think of how\nunimportant it all was in the outcome.\n\nFor this especial carnage was of supreme and world-wide significance so\nlong ago that it is now not worth the pains involved to rephrase for\ninattentive hearing the combat of the knights at Perdigon--out of which\ncame alive only Guivric and Coth and Anavalt and Gonfal,--or to speak of\nthe once famous battle of the tinkers, or to retell how the inflexible\nsyndics of Montors were imprisoned in a cage and slain by mistake. It no\nlonger really matters to any living person how the Northmen burned the\nbridge of boats at Manneville; nor how Asmund trod upon a burned-through\nbeam at the disastrous siege of \u00c9vre, and so fell thirty feet into the\nmidst of his enemies and broke his leg, but dealt so valorously that he\ngot safe away; nor how at Lisuarte unarmored peasants beat off Manuel's\nfollowers with scythes and pitchforks and clubs.\n\nTime has washed out the significance of these old heroisms as the color\nis washed from flimsy cloths; so that chroniclers act wisely when they\nwave aside, with undipped pens, the episode of the brave Siennese and\ntheir green poison at Bellegarde, and the doings of the Anti-Pope there,\nand grudge the paper needful to record the remarkable method by which\ngaunt Tohil Vaca levied a tax of a livre on every chimney in Poictesme.\n\nIt is not even possible, nowadays, to put warm interest in those once\nnotable pots of blazing sulphur and fat and quicklime that were emptied\nover the walls of Storisende, to the discomfort of Manuel's men. For\nalthough this was a very heroic war, with a parade of every sort of high\nmoral principle, and with the most sonorous language employed upon both\nsides, it somehow failed to bring about either the reformation or the\nruin, of humankind: and after the conclusion of the murdering and\ngeneral breakage, the world went on pretty much as it has done after all\nother wars, with a vague notion that a deal of time and effort had been\nunprofitably invested, and a conviction that it would be inglorious to\nsay so.\n\nTherefore it suffices to report that there was much killing and misery\neverywhere, and that in June, upon Corpus Christi day, the Conde de\nTohil Vaca was taken, and murdered, with rather horrible jocosity which\nused unusually a heated poker, and Manuel's forces were defeated and\nscattered.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nXXVI\n\n\nDeals with the Stork\n\n\nNow Manuel, driven out of Poictesme, went with his wife to Novogath,\nwhich had been for some seven years the capital of Philistia. Queen\nStultitia, the sixtieth of that name to rule, received them friendlily.\nShe talked alone with Manuel for a lengthy while, in a room that was\nwalled with glazed tiles of faience and had its ceiling incrusted with\nmoral axioms, everywhere affixed thereto in a light lettering of tin, so\nas to permit of these axioms being readily changed. Stultitia sat at a\nbronze reading-desk: she wore rose-colored spectacles, and at her feet\ndozed, for the while, her favorite plaything, a blind, small, very fat\nwhite bitch called Luck.\n\nThe Queen still thought that an alliance could be arranged against Duke\nAsmund as soon as public sentiment could be fomented in Philistia, but\nthis would take time. \"Have patience, my friend!\" she said, and that was\neasy saying for a prosperous great lady sitting comfortably crowned and\nspectacled in her own palace, under her own chimneys and skylights and\ncampaniles and domes and towers and battlements.\n\nBut in the mean while Manuel and Niafer had not so much as a cowshed\nwherein to exercise this recommended virtue. So Manuel made inquiries,\nand learned that Queen Freydis had taken up her abode on Sargyll, most\nremote of the Red Islands.\n\n\"We will go to Freydis,\" he told Niafer.\n\n\"But, surely, not after the way that minx probably believes you treated\nher?\" said Niafer.\n\nManuel smiled the sleepy smile that was Manuel. \"I know Freydis better\nthan you know her, my dear.\"\n\n\"Yes, but can you depend upon her?\"\n\n\"I can depend upon myself, and that is more important.\"\n\n\"But, Manuel, you have another dear friend in England; and in England,\nalthough the Lord knows I never want to lay eyes on her, we might at\nleast be comfortable--\"\n\nManuel shook his head: \"I am very fond of Alianora, because she\nresembles me as closely as it is possible for a woman to resemble a man.\nThat makes two excellent reasons--one for each of us, snip,--why we had\nbetter not go into England.\"\n\nSo, in their homeless condition, they resolved to set out for\nSargyll,--\"to visit that other dear friend of yours,\" as Niafer put it,\nin tones more eloquent than Manuel seemed quite to relish.\n\nDame Niafer, though, now began to complain that Manuel was neglecting\nher for all this statecraft and fighting and speech-making and private\nconference with fine ladies; and she began to talk again about what a\npity it was that she and Manuel would probably never have any children\nto be company for Niafer. Niafer complained rather often nowadays, about\ndetails which are here irrelevant: and she was used to lament with every\nappearance of sincerity that, in making the clay figure for Niafer to\nlive in, Manuel should have been so largely guided by the elsewhere\nestimable qualities of innocence and imagination. It frequently put her,\nshe said, to great inconvenience.\n\nNow Manuel had been inquiring about this and that and the other since\nhis arrival in Novogath, and so Manuel to-day replied with lordly\nassurance. \"Yes, yes, a baby or two!\" says Manuel. \"I think myself that\nwould be an excellent idea, while we are waiting for Queen Stultitia to\nmake up her subjects' minds, and have nothing else in particular to\ndo--\"\n\n\"But, Manuel, you know perfectly well--\"\n\n\"--And I am sufficiently versed in the magic of the Apsarasas to be able\nto summon the stork, who by rare good luck is already indebted to me--\"\n\n\"What has the stork to do with this?\"\n\n\"Why, it is he who must bring the babies to be company for you.\"\n\n\"But, Manuel,\" said Niafer, dubiously, \"I do not believe that the people\nof Rathgor, or of Poictesme either, get their babies from the stork.\"\n\n\"Doubtless, like every country, they have their quaint local customs. We\nhave no concern, however with these provincialities just now, for we are\nin Philistia. Besides, as you cannot well have forgotten, our main\ndependence is upon the half-promised alliance with Queen Stultitia, who\nis, as far as I can foresee, my darling, the only monarch anywhere\nlikely to support us.\"\n\n\"But what has Queen Stultitia to do with my having a baby?\"\n\n\"Everything, dear snip. You must surely understand it is most important\nfor one in my position to avoid in any way offending the sensibilities\nof the Philistines.\"\n\n\"Still, Manuel, the Philistines themselves have babies, and I do not see\nhow they could have conceivably objected to my having at any rate a very\nsmall one if only you had made me right--\"\n\n\"Not at all! nobody objects to the baby in itself, now that you are a\nmarried woman. The point is that the babies of the Philistines are\nbrought to them by the stork; and that even an allusion to the\npossibility of misguided persons obtaining a baby in any other way these\nPhilistines consider to be offensive and lewd and lascivious and\nobscene.\"\n\n\"Why, how droll of them! But are you sure of that, Manuel!\"\n\n\"All their best-thought-of and most popular writers, my dear, are\nunanimous upon the point; and their Seranim have passed any number of\nlaws, their oil-merchants have founded a guild, especially to prosecute\nsuch references. No, there is, to be sure, a dwindling sect which favors\nputting up with what babies you may find in the cabbage patch, but all\nreally self-respecting people when in need of offspring arrange to be\nvisited by the stork.\"\n\n\"It is certainly a remarkable custom, but it sounds convenient if you\ncan manage it,\" said Niafer. \"What I want is the baby, though, and of\ncourse we must try to get the baby in the manner of the Philistines, if\nyou know that manner, for I am sure I have no wish to offend anybody.\"\n\nSo Manuel prepared to get a baby in the manner preferred by the\nPhilistines. He performed the suitable incantation, putting this and\nthat together in the manner formerly employed by the Thessalian witches\nand sorcerers, and he cried aloud a very ancient if indecent charm from\nthe old Latin, saying, as Queen Stultitia had told him to say, without\nany mock-modest mincing of words:\n\n    Dictum est antiqua sandalio mulier habitavit,\n  Quae multos pueros habuit tum ut potuit nullum\n  Quod faciundum erat cognoscere. Sic Domina Anser._\n\nThen Manuel took from his breast-pocket a piece of blue chalk and five\ncurious objects something like small black stars. With the chalk he drew\nupon the floor two parallel straight lines. Manuel walked on one of\nthese chalk lines very carefully, then beckoned Niafer to him. Standing\nthere, he put his arms about her and kissed her. Then he placed the five\nblack stars in a row,--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n--and went over to the next line.\n\nThe stork having been thus properly summoned, Manuel recalled to the\nbird the three wishes which had been promised when Manuel saved the\nstork's life: and Manuel said that for each wish he would take a son\nfetched to him by the stork in the manner of the Philistines.\n\nThe stork thought it could be arranged. \"Not this morning, though, as\nyou suggest, for, indebted as I am to you, Dom Manuel, I am also a very\nbusy bird. No, I have any number of orders that were put in months\nbefore yours, and I must follow system in my business, for you have no\nnotion what elaborate and exact accounts are frequently required by the\nmarried men that receive invoices from me.\"\n\n\"Come now,\" says Manuel, \"do you be accommodating, remembering how I\nonce saved your life from the eagle, and my wife and I will order all\nour babies now, and spare you the trouble of keeping any accounts\nwhatever, so far as we are concerned.\"\n\n\"Oh, if you care to deal with such wholesale irregularity, and have no\nmore consideration than to keep casting old debts in my bill, I might\nstretch a point in order to be rid of you,\" the stork said, sighing.\n\n\"Now, but surely,\" Manuel considered, \"you might be a little more\ncheerful about this matter.\"\n\n\"And why should I, of all the birds that go about the heavens, be\ncheerful?\"\n\n\"Well, somehow one expects a reasonable gaiety in you who bring hilarity\nand teething-rings into so many households--\"\n\nThe stork answered:\n\n\"I bring the children, stainless and dear and helpless, and therewith I,\nthey say, bring joy. Now of the joy I bring to the mother let none\nspeak, for miracles are not neatly to be caged in sentences, nor is\ntruth always expedient. To the father I bring the sight of his own life,\nby him so insecurely held, renewed and strengthened in a tenement not\nyet impaired by time and folly: he is no more disposed to belittle\nhimself here than elsewhere; and it is himself that he cuddles in this\nsmall, soft, incomprehensible and unsoiled incarnation. For, as I bring\nthe children, they have no evil in them and no cowardice and no guile.\n\n\"I bring the children, stainless and dear and helpless, when later I\nreturn, to those that yesterday were children. And in all ways time has\nmarred, and living has defaced, and prudence has maimed, until I grieve\nto entrust that which I bring to what remains of that which yesterday I\nbrought. In the old days children were sacrificed to a brazen burning\ngod, but time affects more subtile hecatombs: for Moloch slew outright.\nYes, Moloch, being divine, killed as the dog kills, furiously, but time\nis that transfigured cat, an ironist. So living mars and defaces and\nmaims, and living appears wantonly to soil and to degrade its prey\nbefore destroying it.\n\n\"I bring the children, stainless and dear and helpless, and I leave them\nto endure that which is fated. Daily I bring into this world the beauty\nand innocence and high-heartedness and faith of children: but life has\nno employment, or else life has no sustenance, for these fine things\nwhich I bring daily, for always I, returning, find the human usages of\nliving have extinguished these excellences in those who yesterday were\nchildren, and that these virtues exist in no aged person. And I would\nthat Jahveh had created me an eagle or a vulture or some other hateful\nbird of prey that furthers a less grievous slaying and a more\nintelligible wasting than I further.\"\n\nTo this, Dom Manuel replied, in that grave and matter-of-fact way of\nhis: \"Now certainly I can see how your vocation may seem, in a manner of\nspeaking, a poor investment; but, after all, your business is none of my\nbusiness, so I shall not presume to criticize it. Instead, let us avoid\nthese lofty generalities, and to you tell me when I may look for those\nthree sons of mine.\"\n\nThen they talked over this matter of getting babies, Manuel walking on\nthe chalk line all the while, and Manuel found he could have, if he\npreferred it so, three girls in place of one of the boys, since the\ndemand for sons was thrice that for daughters. To Niafer it was at once\napparent that to obtain five babies in place of three was a clear\nbargain. Manuel said he did not want any daughters, they were too much\nof a responsibility, and he did not intend to be bothered with them. He\nwas very firm and lordly about it. Then Niafer spoke again, and when she\nhad ended, Manuel wished for two boys and three girls. Thereafter the\nstork subscribed five promissory notes, and they executed all the other\nrequisite formalities.\n\n[Illustration: \"SUMMONS THE STORK\"]\n\nThe stork said that by a little management he could let them have one of\nthe children within a day or so. \"But how long have you two been\nmarried?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, ever so long,\" said Manuel, with a faint sigh.\n\n\"Why, no, my dearest,\" said Niafer, \"we have been married only seven\nmonths.\"\n\n\"In that event,\" declared the stork, \"you had better wait until month\nafter next, for it is not the fashion among my patrons to have me\nvisiting them quite so early.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Manuel, \"we wish to do everything in conformance to the\npreferences of Philistia, even to the extent of following such\nincomprehensible fashions.\" So he arranged to have the promised baby\ndelivered at Sargyll, which, he told the stork, would be their address\nfor the remainder of the summer.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\nXXVII\n\n\nThey Come to Sargyll\n\n\nThen Manuel and Niafer put out to sea, and after two days' voyaging they\ncame to Sargyll and to the hospitality of Queen Freydis. Freydis was\nmuch talked about at that time on account of the way in which King\nThibaut had come to his ruin through her, and on account of her equally\nfatal dealings with the Duke of Istria and the Prince of Camwy and three\nor four other lords. So the ship-captains whom Dom Manuel first\napproached preferred not to venture among the Red Islands. Then the\nJewish master of a trading vessel--a lean man called Ahasuerus--said,\n\"Who forbids it?\" and carried them uneventfully from Novogath to\nSargyll. They narrate how Oriander the Swimmer followed after the yellow\nship, but he attempted no hurt against Manuel, at least not for that\nturn.\n\nThus Manuel came again to Freydis. He had his first private talk with\nher in a room that was hung with black and gold brocade. White mats lay\nupon the ground, and placed irregularly about the room were large brass\nvases filled with lotus blossoms. Here Freydis sat on a three-legged\nstool, in conference with a panther. From the ceiling hung rigid blue\nand orange and reddish-brown serpents, all dead and embalmed; and in the\nmiddle of the ceiling was painted a face which was not quite human,\nlooking downward, with evil eyes half closed, and with its mouth half\nopen in discomfortable laughter.\n\nFreydis was clad in scarlet completely, and, as has been said, a golden\npanther was talking to her when Dom Manuel came in. She at once\ndismissed the beast, which smiled amicably at Dom Manuel, and then\narched high its back in the manner of all the cat tribe, and so\nflattened out into a thin transparent goldness, and, flickering,\nvanished upward as a flame leaves a lampwick.\n\n\"Well, well, you bade me come to you, dear friend, when I had need of\nyou,\" says Manuel, very cordially shaking hands, \"and nobody's need\ncould be more great than mine.\"\n\n\"Different people have different needs,\" Freydis replied, rather\ngravely, \"but all passes in this world.\"\n\n\"Friendship, however, does not pass, I hope.\"\n\nShe answered slowly: \"It is we who pass, so that the young Manuel whom I\nloved in a summer that is gone, is nowadays as perished as that summer's\ngay leaves. What, grizzled fighting-man, have you to do with that young\nManuel who had comeliness and youth and courage, but no human pity and\nno constant love? and why should I be harboring his lighthearted\nmischiefs against you? Ah, no, gray Manuel, you are quite certain no\nwoman would do that; and people say you are shrewd. So I bid you very\nwelcome to Sargyll, where my will is the only law.\"\n\n\"You at least have not changed,\" Dom Manuel replied, with utter truth,\n\"for you appear today, if anything, more fair and young than you were\nthat first night upon Morven when I evoked you from tall flames to lend\nlife to the image I had made. Well, that seems now a lengthy while ago,\nand I make no more images.\"\n\n\"Your wife would be considering it a waste of time,\" Queen Freydis\nestimated.\n\n\"No, that is not quite the way it is. For Niafer is the dearest and most\ndutiful of women, and she never crosses my wishes in anything.\"\n\nFreydis now smiled a little, for she saw that Manuel believed he was\nspeaking veraciously. \"At all events,\" said Freydis, \"it is a queer\nthing surely that in the month which is to come the stork will be\nfetching your second child to a woman resting under my roof and in my\ngolden bed. Yes, Thurinel has just been telling me of your plan, and it\nis a queer thing. Yet it is a far queerer thing that your first child,\nwhom no stork fetched nor had any say in shaping, but whom you made of\nclay to the will of your proud youth and in your proud youth's likeness,\nshould be limping about the world somewhere in the appearance of a\nstrapping tall young fellow, and that you should know nothing about his\ndoings.\"\n\n\"Ah! what have you heard? and what do you know about him, Freydis?\"\n\n\"I suspicion many things, gray Manuel, by virtue of my dabblings in that\ngray art which makes neither for good nor evil.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Manuel, practically, \"but what do you know?\"\n\nShe took his hand again. \"I know that in Sargyll, where my will is the\nonly law, you are welcome, false friend and very faithless lover.\"\n\nHe could get no more out of her, as they stood there under the painted\nface which looked down upon them with discomfortable laughter.\n\nSo Manuel and Niafer remained at Sargyll until the baby should be\ndelivered. King Ferdinand, then in the midst of another campaign against\nthe Moors, could do nothing for his vassal just now. But glittering\nmessengers came from Raymond B\u00e9renger, and from King Helmas, and from\nQueen Stultitia, each to discuss this and that possible alliance and aid\nby and by. Everybody was very friendly if rather vague. But Manuel for\nthe present considered only Niafer and the baby that was to come, and he\nlet statecraft bide.\n\nThen two other ships, that were laden with Duke Asmund's men, came also,\nin an attempt to capture Manuel: so Freydis despatched a sending which\ncaused these soldiers to run about the decks howling like wolves, and to\nfling away their swords and winged helmets, and to fight one against the\nother with hands and teeth until all were slain.\n\nThe month passed thus uneventfully. And Niafer and Freydis became the\nbest and most intimate of friends, and their cordiality to each other\ncould not but have appeared to the discerning rather ominous.\n\n\"She seems to be a very good-hearted sort of a person,\" Niafer conceded,\nin matrimonial privacy, \"though certainly she is rather queer. Why,\nManuel, she showed me this afternoon ten of the drollest figures to\nwhich--but, no, you would never guess it in the world,--to which she is\ngoing to give life some day, just as you did to me when you got my looks\nand legs and pretty much everything else all wrong.\"\n\n\"When does she mean to quicken them?\" Dom Manuel asked: and he added,\n\"Not that I did, dear snip, but I shall not argue about it.\"\n\n\"Why, that is the droll part of it, and I can quite understand your\nunwillingness to admit how little you had remembered about me. When the\nman who made them has been properly rewarded, she said, with, Manuel,\nthe most appalling expression you ever saw.\"\n\n\"What were these images like?\" asked Dom Manuel.\n\nNiafer described them: she described them unsympathetically, but there\nwas no doubt they were the images which Manuel had left unquickened upon\nUpper Morven.\n\nManuel nodded, smiled, and said: \"So the man who made these images is to\nbe properly rewarded! Well, that is encouraging, for true merit should\nalways be rewarded.\"\n\n\"But, Manuel, if you had seen her look! and seen what horrible misshapen\ncreatures they were--!\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Manuel, stoutly: \"you are a dear snip, but that does\nnot make you a competent critic of either physiognomy or sculpture.\"\n\nSo he laughed the matter aside; and this, as it happened, was the last\nthat Dom Manuel heard of the ten images which he had made upon Upper\nMorven. But they of Poictesme declared that Queen Freydis did give life\nto these figures, each at a certain hour, and that her wizardry set them\nto live as men among mankind, with no very happy results, because these\nimages differed from naturally begotten persons by having inside them a\nspark of the life of Audela.\n\nThus Manuel and his wife came uneventfully to August; all the while\nthere was never a more decorous or more thoughtful hostess than Queen\nFreydis; and nobody would have suspected that sorcery underlay the\nrunning of her household. It was only through Dom Manuel's happening to\narise very early one morning, at the call of nature, that he chanced to\nbe passing through the hall when, at the moment of sunrise, the\nnight-porter turned into an orange-colored rat, and crept into the\nwainscoting: and Manuel of course said nothing about this to anybody,\nbecause it was none of his affair.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\nXXVIII\n\n\nHow Melicent Was Welcomed\n\n\nSo the month passed prosperously and uneventfully, while the servitors\nof Queen Freydis behaved in every respect as if they were human beings:\nand at the end of the month the stork came.\n\nManuel and Niafer, it happened, were fishing on the river bank rather\nlate that evening, when they saw the great bird approaching, high\noverhead, all glistening white in the sunset, except for his thin\nscarlet legs and the blue shadowings in the hollows of his wings. From\nhis beak depended a largish bundle, in pale blue wrappings, so that at a\nglance they knew the stork was bringing a girl.\n\nStatelily the bird lighted on the window sill, as though he were quite\nfamiliar with this way of entering Manuel's bedroom, and the bird went\nin, carrying the child. This was a high and happy moment for the fond\nparents as they watched him, and they kissed each other rather solemnly.\n\nThen Niafer left Manuel to get together the fishing tackle, and she\nhastened into the house to return to the stork the first of his\npromissory notes in exchange for the baby. And as Manuel was winding up\nthe lines, Queen Freydis came to him, for she too had seen the stork's\napproach; and was, she said, with a grave smile, well pleased that the\naffair was settled.\n\n\"For now the stork has come, yet others may come,\" says Freydis, \"and we\nshall celebrate the happy event with a gay feast this night in honor of\nyour child.\"\n\n\"That is very kind and characteristic of you,\" said Manuel, \"but I\nsuppose you will be wanting me to make a speech, and I am quite\nunprepared.\"\n\n\"No, we will have none of your high-minded and devastating speeches at\nour banquet. No, for your place is with your wife. No, Manuel, you are\nnot bidden to this feast, for all that it is to do honor to your child.\nNo, no, gray Manuel, you must remain upstairs this evening and\nthroughout the night, because this feast is for them that serve me: and\nyou do not serve me any longer, and the ways of them that serve me are\nnot your ways.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" says Manuel, \"so there is sorcery afoot! Yes, Freydis, I have\nquite given over that sort of thing. And while not for a moment would I\nseem to be criticizing anybody, I hope before long to see you settling\ndown, with some fine solid fellow, and forsaking these empty frivolities\nfor the higher and real pleasures of life.\"\n\n\"And what are these delights, gray Manuel?\"\n\n\"The joy that is in the sight of your children playing happily about\nyour hearth, and developing into honorable men and gracious women, and\nbringing their children in turn to cluster about your tired old knees,\nas the winter evenings draw in, and in the cosy fire-light you smile\nacross the curly heads of these children's children at the dear wrinkled\nwhite-haired face of your beloved and time-tested helpmate, and are\nsatisfied, all in all, with your life, and know that, by and large,\nHeaven has been rather undeservedly kind to you,\" says Manuel, sighing.\n\"Yes, Freydis, yes, you may believe me that such are the real joys of\nlife; and that such pleasures are more profitably pursued than are the\nidle gaieties of sorcery and witchcraft, which indeed at our age, if you\nwill permit me to speak thus frankly, dear friend, are hardly\ndignified.\"\n\nFreydis shook her proud dark head. Her smiling was grim.\n\n\"Decidedly, I shall not ever understand you. Doddering patriarch, do you\nnot comprehend you are already discoursing about a score or two of\ngrandchildren on the ground of having a five-minute-old daughter, whom\nyou have not yet seen? Nor is that child's future, it may be, yours to\nsettle--But go to your wife, for this is Niafer's man who is talking,\nand not mine. Go up, Methuselah, and behold the new life which you have\ncreated and cannot control!\"\n\nManuel went to Niafer, and found her sewing. \"My dear, this will not do\nat all, for you ought to be in bed with the newborn child, as is the\ncustom with the mothers of Philistia.\"\n\n\"What nonsense!\" says Niafer, \"when I have to be changing every one of\nthe pink bows on Melicent's caps for blue bows.\"\n\n\"Still, Niafer, it is eminently necessary for us to be placating the\nPhilistines in all respects, in this delicate matter of your having a\nbaby.\"\n\nNiafer grumbled, but obeyed. She presently lay in the golden bed of\nFreydis: then Manuel duly looked at the contents of the small heaving\nbundle at Niafer's side: and whether or no he scaled the conventional\npeaks of emotion was nobody's concern save Manuel's. He began, in any\nevent, to talk in the vein which fathers ordinarily feel such high\noccasions to demand. But Niafer, who was never romantic nowadays, merely\nsaid that, anyhow, it was a blessing it was all over, and that she\nhoped, now, they would soon be leaving Sargyll.\n\n\"But Freydis is so kind, my dear,\" said Manuel, \"and so fond of you!\"\n\n\"I never in my life,\" declared Niafer, \"knew anybody to go off so\nterribly in their looks as that two-faced cat has done since the first\ntime I saw her prancing on her tall horse and rolling her snake eyes at\nyou. As for being fond of me, I trust her exactly as far as I can see\nher.\"\n\n\"Yet, Niafer, I have heard you declare, time and again--\"\n\n\"But if you did, Manuel, one has to be civil.\"\n\nManuel shrugged, discreetly. \"You women!\" he observed, discreetly.\n\n\"--As if it were not as plain as the nose on her face--and I do not\nsuppose that even you, Manuel, will be contending she has a really good\nnose,--that the woman is simply itching to make a fool of you, and to\nhave everybody laughing at you, again! Manuel, I declare I have no\npatience with you when you keep arguing about such unarguable facts!\"\n\nManuel, exercising augmented discretion, now said nothing whatever.\n\n\"--And you may talk yourself black in the face, Manuel, but nevertheless\nI am going to name the child Melicent, after my own mother, as soon as a\npriest can be fetched from the mainland to christen her. No, Manuel, it\nis all very well for your dear friend to call herself a gray witch, but\nI do not notice any priests coming to this house unless they are\nespecially sent for, and I draw my own conclusions.\"\n\n\"Well, well, let us not argue about it, my dear.\"\n\n\"Yes, but who started all this arguing and fault-finding, I would like\nto know!\"\n\n\"Why, to be sure I did. But I spoke without thinking. I was wrong. I\nadmit it. So do not excite yourself, dear snip.\"\n\n\"--And as if I could help the child's not being a boy!\"\n\n\"But I never said--\"\n\n\"No, but you keep thinking it, and sulking is the one thing I cannot\nstand. No, Manuel, no, I do not complain, but I do think that, after all\nI have been through with, sleeping around in tents, and running away\nfrom Northmen, and never having a moment's comfort, after I had\nnaturally figured on being a real countess--\" Niafer whimpered sleepily.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" says Manuel, stroking her soft crinkly hair.\n\n\"--And with that silky hell-cat watching me all the time,--and looking\nten years younger than I do, now that you have got my face and legs all\nwrong,--and planning I do not know what--\"\n\n\"Yes, to be sure,\" says Manuel, soothingly: \"you are quite right, my\ndear.\"\n\nSo a silence fell, and presently Niafer slept. Manuel sat with hunched\nshoulders, watching the wife he had fetched back from paradise at the\nprice of his youth. His face was grave, his lips were puckered and\nprotruded. He smiled by and by, and he shook his head. He sighed, not as\none who is grieved, but like a man perplexed and a little weary.\n\nNow some while after Niafer was asleep, and when the night was fairly\nadvanced, you could hear a whizzing and a snorting in the air. Manuel\nwent to the window, and lifted the scarlet curtain figured with ramping\ngold dragons, and he looked out, to find a vast number of tiny bluish\nlights skipping about confusedly and agilely in the darkness, like\nshining fleas. These approached the river bank, and gathered there. Then\nthe assembled lights began to come toward the house. You could now see\nthese lights were carried by dwarfs who had the eyes of owls and the\nlong beaks of storks. These dwarfs were jumping and dancing about\nFreydis like an insane body-guard.\n\nFreydis walked among them very remarkably attired. Upon her head shone\nthe uraeus crown, and she carried a long rod of cedar-wood topped with\nan apple carved in bluestone, and at her side came the appearance of a\ntall young man.\n\nSo they all approached the house, and the young man looked up fixedly at\nthe unlighted window, as though he were looking at Manuel. The young man\nsmiled: his teeth gleamed in the blue glare. Then the whole company\nentered the house, and from Manuel's station at the window you could see\nno more, but you could hear small prancing hoof-beats downstairs and the\nclattering of plates and much whinnying laughter. Manuel was plucking\nirresolutely at his grizzled short beard, for there was no doubt as to\nthe strapping tall young fellow.\n\nPresently you could hear music: it was the ravishing Nis air, which\ncharms the mind into sweet confusion and oblivion, and Manuel did not\nmake any apparent attempt to withstand its wooing. He hastily undressed,\nknelt for a decorous interval, and climbed vexedly into bed.\n\n\n\nXXIX\n\n\nSesphra of the Dreams\n\n\nIn the morning Dom Manuel arose early, and left Niafer still sleeping\nwith the baby. Manuel came down through the lower hall, where the table\nwas as the revelers had left it. In the middle of the disordered room\nstood a huge copper vessel half full of liquor, and beside it was a\ndrinking-horn of gold. Manuel paused here, and drank of the sweet\nheather-wine as though he had need to hearten himself.\n\nHe went out into the bright windy morning, and as he crossed the fields\nhe came up behind a red cow who was sitting upon her haunches, intently\nreading a largish book bound in green leather, but at sight of Manuel\nshe hastily put aside the volume, and began eating grass. Manuel went\non, without comment, toward the river bank, to meet the image which he\nhad made of clay, and to which through unholy arts he had given life.\n\nThe thing came up out of the glistening ripples of brown water, and the\nthing embraced Manuel and kissed him. \"I am pagan,\" the thing said, in a\nsweet mournful voice, \"and therefore I might not come to you until your\nlove was given to the unchristened. For I was not ever christened, and\nso my true name is not known to anybody. But in the far lands where I am\nworshipped as a god I am called Sesphra of the Dreams.\"\n\n\"I did not give you any name,\" said Manuel; and then he said: \"Sesphra,\nyou that have the appearance of Alianora and of my youth! Sesphra, how\nbeautiful you are!\"\n\n\"Is that why you are trembling, Manuel?\"\n\n\"I tremble because the depths of my being have been shaken. Since youth\nwent out of me, in the high woods of Dun Vlechlan, I have lived through\ndays made up of small frettings and little pleasures and only half\nearnest desires, which moved about upon the surface of my being like\nminnows in the shoals of a still lake. But now that I have seen and\nheard you, Sesphra of the Dreams, and your lips have touched my lips, a\npassion moves in me that possesses all of me, and I am frightened.\"\n\n\"It is the passion which informs those who make images. It is the master\nyou denied, poor foolish Manuel, and the master who will take no\ndenial.\"\n\n\"Sesphra, what is your will with me?\"\n\n\"It is my will that you and I go hence on a long journey, into the far\nlands where I am worshipped as a god. For I love you, my creator, who\ngave life to me, and you love me more than aught else, and it is not\nright that we be parted.\"\n\n\"I cannot go on any journey, just now, for I have my lands and castles\nto regain, and my wife and my newborn child to protect.\"\n\nSesphra began to smile adorably: you saw that his teeth were strangely\nwhite and very strong. \"What are these things to me or you, or to anyone\nthat makes images? We follow after our own thinking and our own\ndesires.\"\n\n\"I lived thus once upon a time,\" said Manuel, sighing, \"but nowadays\nthere is a bond upon me to provide for my wife, and for my child too,\nand I have not much leisure left for anything else.\"\n\nThen Sesphra began to speak adorably, as he walked on the river bank,\nwith one arm about Dom Manuel. Always Sesphra limped as he walked. A\nstiff and obdurate wind was ruffling the broad brown shining water, and\nas they walked, this wind buffeted them, and tore at their clothing.\nManuel clung to his hat with one hand, and with the other held to lame\nSesphra of the Dreams. Sesphra talked of matters not to be recorded.\n\n\"That is a handsome ring you have there,\" says Sesphra, by and by.\n\n\"It is the ring my wife gave me when we were married,\" Manuel replied.\n\n\"Then you must give it to me, dear Manuel.\"\n\n\"No, no, I cannot part with it.\"\n\n\"But it is beautiful, and I want it,\" Sesphra said. So Manuel gave him\nthe ring.\n\nNow Sesphra began again to talk of matters not to be recorded.\n\n\"Sesphra of the Dreams,\" says Manuel, presently, \"you are bewitching me,\nfor when I listen to you I see that Manuel's imperilled lands make such\na part of earth as one grain of sand contributes to the long narrow\nbeach we are treading. I see my fond wife Niafer as a plain-featured and\ndull woman, not in any way remarkable among the millions of such women\nas are at this moment preparing breakfast or fretting over other small\ntasks. I see my newborn child as a mewing lump of flesh. And I see\nSesphra whom I made so strong and strange and beautiful, and it is as if\nin a half daze I hear that obdurate wind commingled with the sweet voice\nof Sesphra while you are talking of matters which it is not safe to talk\nabout.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is the way it is, Manuel, and the way it should be, and the\nway it always will be as long as life is spared to you, now. So let us\ngo into the house, and write droll letters to King Helmas and Raymond\nB\u00e9renger and Queen Stultitia, in reply to the fine offers they have been\nmaking you.\"\n\nThey came back into the empty banquet-hall. This place was paved with\nmother of pearl and copper; six porphyry columns supported the\nmusicians' gallery. To the other end were two alabaster urns upon green\npedestals that were covered with golden writing in the old Dirgham.\n\nHere Manuel cleared away the embossed silver plates from one corner of\nthe table. He took pen and ink, and Sesphra told him what to write.\n\nSesphra sat with arms folded, and as he dictated he looked up at the\nceiling. This ceiling was of mosaic work, showing four winged creatures\nthat veiled their faces with crimson and orange-tawny wings; suspended\nfrom this ceiling by bronze chains hung ostrich eggs, bronze lamps and\nglobes of crystal.\n\n\"But these are very insulting replies,\" observed Dom Manuel, when he had\nfinished writing, \"and they will make their recipients furious. These\nprinces, Sesphra, are my good friends, and they are powerful friends,\nupon whose favor I am dependent.\"\n\n\"Yes, but how beautiful these replies are worded! See now, dear Manuel,\nhow divertingly you have described King Helmas' hideous nose in your\nletter to King Helmas, and how trenchant is that paragraph about the\nscales of his mermaid wife--\"\n\n\"I admit that passage is rather droll--\"\n\n\"--And in your letter to the pious Queen Stultitia that which you say\nabout the absurdities of religion, here, and the fun you make of her\nspectacles, are masterpieces of paradox and of very exquisite prose--\"\n\n\"Those bits, to be sure, are quite neatly put--\"\n\n\"--So I must see to it that these replies are sent, to make people\nadmire you everywhere.\"\n\n\"Yet, Sesphra, all these princes are my friends, and their goodwill is\nnecessary to me--\"\n\n\"No, Manuel. For you and I will not bother about these stupid princes\nany more, nor will you need any friends except me; for we will go to\nthis and that remote strange place, and our manner of living will be\nsuch and such, and we will do so and so, and we will travel everywhither\nand see the ends of this world and judge them. And we will not ever be\nparted until you die.\"\n\n\"What will you do then, dear Sesphra?\" Manuel asks him fondly.\n\n\"I shall survive you, as all gods outlive their creators. And I must\ndepute the building of your monument to men of feeble minds which have\nbeen properly impaired by futile studies and senility. That is the way\nin which all gods are doomed to deal with their creators: but that need\nnot trouble us as yet.\"\n\n\"No,\" Manuel said, \"I cannot go with you. For in my heart is enkindling\nsuch love of you as frightens me.\"\n\n\"It is through love men win to happiness, poor lonely Manuel.\"\n\nNow when Manuel answered Sesphra there was in Manuel's face trouble and\nbewilderment. And Manuel said:\n\n\"Under your dear bewitchments, Sesphra, I confess that through love men\nwin to sick disgust and self-despising, and for that reason I will not\nlove any more. Now breathlessly the tall lads run to clutch at stars,\nabove the brink of a drab quagmire, and presently time trips them--Oh,\nSesphra, wicked Sesphra of the Dreams, you have laid upon me a magic so\nstrong that, horrified, I hear the truth come babbling from long-guarded\nlips which no longer obey me, because of your dear bewitchments.\n\n\"Look you, adorable and all-masterful Sesphra, I have followed noble\nloves. I aspired to the Unattainable Princess, and thereafter to the\nunattainable Queen of a race that is more fine and potent than our race,\nand afterward I would have no less a love than an unattainable angel in\nparadise. Hah, I must be fit mate for that which is above me, was my\ncrying in the old days; and such were the indomitable desires that one\nby one have made my living wonderful with dear bewitchments.\n\n\"The devil of it was that these proud aims did not stay unattained!\nInstead, I was cursed by getting my will, and always my reward was\nnothing marvelous and rare, but that quite ordinary figure of earth, a\nhuman woman. And always in some dripping dawn I have turned with\nabhorrence from myself and from the sated folly that had hankered for\nsuch prizes, which, when possessed, showed as not wonderful in anything,\nand which possession left likable enough, but stripped of dear\nbewitchments.\n\n\"No, Sesphra, no: men are so made that they must desire to mate with\nsome woman or another, and they are furthermore so made that to mate\nwith a woman does not content their desire. And in this gaming there is\nno gain, because the end of loving, for everybody except those lucky\npersons whose love is not requited, must always be a sick disgust and a\nself-despising, which the wise will conduct in silence, and not talk\nabout as I am talking now under your dear bewitchments.\"\n\nThen Sesphra smiled a little, saying, \"And yet, poor Manuel, there is,\nthey tell me, no more uxorious husband anywhere.\"\n\n\"I am used to her,\" Manuel replied, forlornly, \"and I suppose that if\nshe were taken away from me again I would again be attempting to fetch\nher back. And I do not like to hurt the poor foolish heart of her by\ngoing against her foolish notions. Besides, I am a little afraid of her,\nbecause she is always able to make me uncomfortable. And above all, of\ncourse, the hero of a famous love-affair, such as ours has become, with\nthose damned poets everywhere making rhymes about my fidelity and\ndevotion, has to preserve appearances. So I get through each day,\nsomehow, by never listening very attentively to the interminable things\nshe tells me about. But I often wonder, as I am sure all husbands\nwonder, why Heaven ever made a creature so tedious and so unreasonably\ndull of wit and so opinionated. And when I think that for the rest of\ntime this creature is to be my companion I usually go out and kill\nsomebody. Then I come back, because she knows the way I like my toast.\"\n\n\"Instead, dear Manuel, you must go away from this woman who does not\nunderstand you--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Manuel said, with grave conviction, \"that is exactly the\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"--And you must go with me who understand you all through. And we will\ntravel everywhither, so that we may see the ends of this world and judge\nthem.\"\n\n\"You tempt me, Sesphra, with an old undying desire, and you have laid\nstrong enchantments on me, but, no, I cannot go with you.\"\n\nThe hand of Sesphra closed upon the hand of Manuel caressingly.\n\nManuel said: \"I will go with you. But what will become of the woman and\nthe child whom I leave behind me unfriended?\"\n\n\"That is true. There will be nobody to look out for them, and they will\nperish miserably. That is not important, but perhaps upon the whole it\nwould be better for you to kill them before we depart from Sargyll.\"\n\n\"Very well, then,\" says Manuel, \"I will do that, but you must come up\ninto the room with me, for I cannot bear to lose sight of you.\"\n\nNow Sesphra smiled more unrestrainedly, and his teeth gleamed. \"I shall\nnot ever leave you now until you die.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nXXX\n\n\nFarewell to Freydis\n\n\nThey went upstairs together, into the room with scarlet hangings, and to\nthe golden bed where, with seven sorts of fruit properly arranged at the\nbedside, Dom Manuel's wife Niafer lay asleep. Manuel drew his dagger.\nNiafer turned in her sleep, so that she seemed to offer her round small\nthroat to the raised knife. You saw now that on the other side of the\ngolden bed sat Queen Freydis, making a rich glow of color there, and in\nher lap was the newborn naked child.\n\nFreydis rose, holding the child to her breast, and smiling. A devil\nmight smile thus upon contriving some new torment for lost souls, but a\nfair woman's face should not be so cruel. Then this evil joy passed from\nthe face of Freydis. She dipped her fingers into the bowl of water with\nwhich she had been bathing the child, and with her finger-tips she made\nupon the child's forehead the sign of a cross.\n\nSaid Freydis, \"Melicent, I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and\nof the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\"\n\nSesphra passed wildly toward the fireplace, crying, \"A penny, a penny,\ntwopence, a penny and a half, and a halfpenny!\" At his call the fire\nshot forth tall flames, and Sesphra entered these flames as a man goes\nbetween parted curtains, and instantly the fire collapsed and was as it\nhad been. Already the hands of Freydis were moving deftly in the Sleep\nCharm, so that Niafer did not move. Freydis to-day was resplendently\nrobed in flame-colored silk, and about her dark hair was a circlet of\nburnished copper.\n\nManuel had dropped his dagger so that the point of it pierced the floor,\nand the weapon stood erect and quivering. But Manuel was shaken for a\nmoment more horribly than shook the dagger: you would have said he was\nconvulsed with horror and self-loathing. So for an instant he waited,\nlooking at Dame Niafer, who slept untroubled, and at fiery-colored\nFreydis, who was smiling rather queerly: and then the old composure came\nback to Manuel.\n\n\"Breaker of all oaths,\" says Freydis, \"I must tell you that this Sesphra\nis pagan, and cannot thrive except among those whose love is given to\nthe unchristened. Thus he might not come to Sargyll until the arrival of\nthis little heathen whom I have just made Christian. Now we have only\nChristian terrors here; and again your fate is in my hands.\"\n\nDom Manuel looked grave. \"Freydis,\" he said, \"you have rescued me from\nvery unbecoming conduct. A moment more and I would have slain my wife\nand child because of this Sesphra's resistless magic.\"\n\nSays Freydis, still smiling a queer secret smile: \"Indeed, there is no\ntelling into what folly and misery Sesphra would not have led you. For\nyou fashioned his legs unevenly, and he has not ever pardoned you his\nlameness.\"\n\n\"The thing is a devil,\" Manuel said. \"And this is the figure I desired\nto make, this is the child of my long dreams and labors! This is the\ncreature I designed to be more admirable and significant than the drab\nmen I found in streets and lanes and palaces! Certainly, I have loosed\namong mankind a blighting misery which I cannot control at all.\"\n\n\"The thing is you as you were once, gray Manuel. You had comeliness and\nwit and youth and courage, and these you gave the image, shaping it\nboldly to your proud youth's will and in your proud youth's likeness.\nBut human pity and any constant love you did not then have to give,\neither to your fellows or to the fine figure you made, nor, very\ncertainly, to me. So you amused yourself by making Sesphra and by making\nme that which we are to-day.\"\n\nNow again showed subtly evil thoughts in the face of this shrewd flaming\nwoman who had so recently brought about the destruction of King Thibaut,\nand of the Duke of Istria, and of those other enamored lords. And Dom\nManuel began to regard her more intently.\n\nIn Manuel's sandals the average person would have reflected, long before\nthis, that Manuel and his wife and child were in this sorcerous place at\nthe mercy of the whims and the unwholesome servitors of this not very\ndependable looking witch-woman. The average person would have\nrecollected distastefully that unusual panther and that discomfortable\nnight-porter and the madness which had smitten Duke Asmund's men, and\nthe clattering vicious little hoofs of the shrill dwarfs; and to the\naverage person this room would have seemed a desirable place to be many\nleagues away from.\n\nBut candid blunt Dom Manuel said, with jovial laughter: \"You speak as if\nyou had not grown more adorable every day, dear Freydis, and as though I\nwould not be vastly flattered to think I had any part in the\nimprovement. You should not fish thus unblushingly for compliments.\"\n\nThe sombre glitterings that were her eyes had narrowed, and she was\nlooking at his hands. Then Freydis said: \"There are pin-points of sweat\nupon the back of your hands, gray Manuel, and so alone do I know that\nyou are badly frightened. Yes, you are rather wonderful, even now.\"\n\n\"I am not unduly frightened, but I am naturally upset by what has just\nhappened. Anybody would be. For I do not know what I must anticipate in\nthe future, and I wish that I had never meddled in this mischancy\nbusiness of creating things I cannot manage.\"\n\nQueen Freydis moved in shimmering splendor toward the fireplace. She\npaused there, considerately looking down at the small contention of\nflames. \"Did you not, though, again create much misery when for your\npleasure you gave life to this girl child? Certainly you must know that\nthere will be in her life--if life indeed be long spared to her,\" said\nFreydis, reflectively,--\"far less of joy than of sorrow, for that is the\nway it is with the life of everybody. But all this likewise is out of\nyour hands. In Sesphra and in the child and in me you have lightly\ncreated that which you cannot control. No, it is I who control the\noutcome.\"\n\nNow a golden panther came quite noiselessly into the room, and sat to\nthe right of Freydis, and looked at Dom Manuel.\n\n\"Why, to be sure,\" says Manuel, heartily, \"and I am sure, too, that\nnobody is better qualified to handle it. Come now, Freydis, just as you\nsay, this is a serious situation, and something really ought to be done\nabout this situation. Come now, dear friend, in what way can we take\nback the life we gave this lovely fiend?\"\n\n\"And would I be wanting to kill my husband?\" Queen Freydis asked, and\nshe smiled wonderfully. \"Why, but yes, this fair lame child of yours is\nmy husband to-day,--poor, frightened, fidgeting gray Manuel,--and I love\nhim, for Sesphra is all that you were when I loved you, Manuel, and when\nyou condescended to take your pleasure of me.\"\n\nNow an orange-colored rat came into the room, and sat down upon the\nhearth to the left hand of Freydis, and looked at Dom Manuel. And the\nrat was is large as the panther.\n\nThen Freydis said: \"No, Manuel, Sesphra must live for a great while,\nlong after you have been turned to graveyard dust: and he will limp\nabout wherever pagans are to be found, and he will always win much love\nfrom the high-hearted pagans because of his comeliness and because of\nhis unfading jaunty youth. And whether he will do any good anywhere is\ndoubtful, but it is certain he will do harm, and it is equally certain\nthat already he weighs my happiness as carelessly as you once weighed\nit.\"\n\nNow came into the room another creature, such as no madman has ever seen\nor imagined, and it lay down at the feet of Freydis, and it looked at\nDom Manuel. Couched thus, this creature yawned and disclosed\nunreassuring teeth.\n\n\"Well, Freydis,\" says Dom Manuel, handsomely, \"but, to be sure, what you\ntell me puts a new complexion upon matters, and not for worlds would I\nbe coming between husband and wife--\"\n\nQueen Freydis looked up from the flames, toward Dom Manuel, very sadly.\nFreydis shrugged, flinging out her hands above the heads of the accursed\nbeasts. \"And at the last I cannot do that, either. So do you two dreary,\nunimportant, well-mated people remain undestroyed, now that I go to seek\nmy husband, and now I endeavor to win my pardon for not letting him\ntorment you. Eh, I was tempted, gray Manuel, to let my masterful fine\nhusband have his pleasure of you, and of this lean ugly hobbling\ncreature and her brat, too, as formerly you had your pleasure of me. But\nwomen are so queerly fashioned that at the last I cannot, quite, consent\nto harm this gray, staid, tedious fellow, nor any of his chattels. For\nall passes in this world save one thing only: and though the young\nManuel whom I loved in a summer that is gone, be nowadays as perished as\nthat summer's gay leaves, it is certain a woman's folly does not ever\nperish.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I did not merit that you should care for me,\" says Manuel,\nrather unhappily. \"But I have always been, and always shall be sincerely\nfond of you, Freydis, and for that reason I rejoice to deduce that you\nare not, now, going to do anything violent and irreparable and such as\nyour better nature would afterward regret.\"\n\n\"I loved you once,\" she said, \"and now I am assured the core of you was\nalways a cold and hard and colorless and very common pebble. But it does\nnot matter now that I am a mortal woman. Either way, you have again made\nuse of me. I have afforded you shelter when you were homeless. And now\nagain you will be getting your desire.\"\n\nQueen Freydis went to the window, and lifted the scarlet curtain figured\nwith ramping gold dragons; but the couching beasts stayed by the hearth,\nand they continued to look at Dom Manuel.\n\n\"Yes, now again, gray Manuel, you will be getting your desire. That ship\nwhich shows at the river bend, with serpents and castles painted on its\nbrown sails, is Miramon Lluagor's ship, which he has sent to fetch you\nfrom Sargyll: and the last day of your days of exile is now over. For\nMiramon is constrained by one who is above us all; therefore Miramon\ncomes gladly and very potently to assist you. And I--who have served\nyour turn!--I may now depart, to look for Sesphra, and for my pardon if\nI can get it.\"\n\n\"But whither do you go, dear Freydis?\" Dom Manuel spoke as though he\nagain felt quite fond of her.\n\n\"What does that matter,\" she answered, looking long and long at him,\n\"now that Count Manuel has no further need of me?\" Then Freydis looked\nat Niafer, lying there in a charmed sleep. \"I neither love nor entirely\nhate you, ugly and lame and lean and fretful Niafer, but assuredly I do\nnot envy you. You are welcome to your fidgeting gray husband. My husband\nis a ruthless god. My husband does not grow old and tender-hearted and\nsubservient to me, and he never will.\" Thereafter Freydis bent downward,\nand Freydis kissed the child she had christened. \"Some day you will be a\nwoman, Melicent, and then you will be loving some man or another man. I\ncould hope that you will then love the man who will make you happy, but\nthat sort of man has not yet been found.\"\n\nDom Manuel came to her, not heeding the accursed beasts at all, and he\ntook both the hands of Freydis in his hands. \"My dear, and do you think\nI am a happy man?\"\n\nShe looked up at him: when she answered, her voice trembled. \"I made you\nhappy, Manuel. I would have made you happy always.\"\n\n\"I wonder if you would have? Ah, well, at all events, the obligation was\nupon me. At no time in a man's life, I find, is there lacking some\nobligation or another: and we must meet each as we best can, not hoping\nto succeed, just aiming not to fall short too far. No, it is not a merry\npursuit. And it is a ruining pursuit!\"\n\nShe said, \"I had not thought ever to be sorry for you--Why should I\ngrieve for you, gray traitor?\"\n\nHarshly he answered: \"Oho, I am not proud of what I have made of my\nlife, and of your life, and of the life of that woman yonder, but do you\nthink I will be whining about it! No, Freydis: the boy that loved and\ndeserted you is here,\"--he beat upon his breast,--\"locked in, imprisoned\nwhile time lasts, dying very lonelily. Well, I am a shrewd gaoler: he\nshall not get out. No, even at the last, dear Freydis, there is the bond\nof silence.\"\n\nShe said, impotently, \"I am sorry--Even at the last you contrive for me\na new sorrow--\"\n\nFor a moment they stood looking at each other, and she remembered\nthereafter his sad and quizzical smiling. These two had nothing more to\nshare in speech or deed.\n\nThen Freydis went away, and the accursed beasts and her castle too went\nwith her, as smoke passes. Manuel was thus left standing out of doors in\na reaped field, alone with his wife and child while Miramon's ship came\nabout. Niafer slept. But now the child awoke to regard the world into\nwhich she had been summoned willy-nilly, and the child began to whimper.\n\nDom Manuel patted this intimidating small creature gingerly, with a\nstrong comely hand from which his wedding ring was missing. That would\nrequire explanations.\n\nIt therefore seems not improbable that he gave over this brief period of\nwaiting, in a reaped field, to wondering just how much about the past he\nmight judiciously tell his wife when she awoke to question him, because\nin the old days that was a problem which no considerate husband failed\nto weigh with care.\n\n\n\nXXXI\n\n\nStatecraft\n\n\nNow from the ship's gangway came seven trumpeters dressed in glistening\nplaids: each led with a silver chain a grayhound, and each of the seven\nhounds carried in his mouth an apple of gold. After these followed three\nharp-players and three clergymen and three jesters, all bearing crested\nstaves and wearing chaplets of roses. Then Miramon Lluagor, lord of the\nnine sleeps and prince of the seven madnesses, comes ashore. An\nincredible company followed. But with him came his wife Gis\u00e8le and their\nlittle child Demetrios, thus named for the old Count of Arnaye: and it\nwas this boy that, they say, when yet in swaddling-bands, was appointed\nto be the slayer of his own father, wise Miramon Lluagor.\n\nDame Niafer was wakened, and the two women went apart to compare and\ndiscuss their babies. They put the children in one cradle. A great while\nafterward were these two again to lie together thus, and from this\nmating was the girl to get long sorrow, and the boy his death.\n\nMeanwhile the snub-nosed lord of the nine sleeps and the squinting Count\nof Poictesme sat down upon the river bank to talk about more serious\nmatters than croup and teething. The sun was high by this time, so Kan\nand Muluc and Ix and Cauac came in haste from the corners of the world,\nand held up a blue canopy to shelter the conferring between their master\nand Dom Manuel.\n\n\"What is this,\" said Miramon Lluagor to Dom Manuel, first of all, \"that\nI hear of your alliance with Philistia, and of your dickerings with a\npeople who say that my finest designs are nothing but indigestion?\"\n\n\"I have lost Poictesme,\" says Manuel, \"and the Philistines offer to\nsupport me in my pretensions.\"\n\n\"But that will never do! I who design all dreams can never consent to\nthat, and no Philistine must ever enter Poictesme. Why did you not come\nto me for help at the beginning, instead of wasting time upon kings and\nqueens?\" demands the magician, fretfully. \"And are you not ashamed to be\nmaking any alliance with Philistia, remembering how you used to follow\nafter your own thinking and your own desire?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Manuel replies, \"I have had as yet nothing save fair words from\nPhilistia, and no alliance is concluded.\"\n\n\"That is more than well. Only, let us be orderly about this. Imprimis,\nyou desire Poictesme--\"\n\n\"No, not in particular, but appearances have to be preserved, and my\nwife thinks it would look better for me to redeem this country from the\noppression of the heathen Northmen, and so provide her with a suitable\nhome.\"\n\n\"Item, then I must obtain this country for you, because there is no\nsense in withstanding our wives in such matters.\"\n\n\"I rejoice at your decision--\"\n\n\"Between ourselves, Manuel, I fancy you now begin to understand the\nreasons which prompted me to bring you the magic sword Flamberge at the\nbeginning of our acquaintance, and have learned who it is that wears the\nbreeches in most marriages.\"\n\n\"No, that is not the way it is at all, Miramon, for my wife is the\ndearest and most dutiful of women, and never crosses my wishes in\nanything.\"\n\nMiramon nodded his approval. \"You are quite right, for somebody might be\noverhearing us. So, let us get on, and do you stop interrupting me.\nItem, you must hold Poictesme, and your heirs forever after must hold\nPoictesme, not in fee but by feudal tenure. Item, you shall hold these\nlands, not under any saint like Ferdinand, but under a quite different\nsort of liege-lord.\"\n\n\"I can see no objection to your terms, thus far. But who is to be my\noverlord?\"\n\n\"A person whom you may remember,\" replied Miramon, and he beckoned\ntoward the rainbow throng of his followers.\n\nOne of them at this signal came forward. He was a tall lean youngster,\nwith ruddy cheeks, wide-set brown eyes, and a smallish head covered with\ncrisp, tightly-curling dark red hair: and Manuel recognized him at once,\nbecause Manuel had every reason to remember the queer talk he had held\nwith this Horvendile just after Niafer had ridden away with Miramon's\ndreadful half-brother.\n\n\"But do you not think that this Horvendile is insane?\" Dom Manuel asked\nthe magician, privately.\n\n\"I confess he very often has that appearance.\"\n\n\"Then why do you make him my overlord?\"\n\n\"I have my reasons, you may depend upon it, and if I do not talk about\nthem you may be sure that for this reticence also I have my reasons.\"\n\n\"But is this Horvendile, then, one of the L\u00e9shy? Is he the Horvendile\nwhose great-toe is the morning star?\"\n\n\"I may tell you that it was he who summoned me to help you in distress,\nof which I had not heard upon Vraidex, but why should I tell you any\nmore, Dom Manuel? Come, is it not enough that am offering you a province\nand comparatively tranquil terms of living with your wife, that you must\nhave all my old secrets to boot?\"\n\n\"You are right,\" says Manuel, \"and prospective benefactors must be\nhumored.\" So he rested content with his ignorance, nor did he ever find\nout about Horvendile, though later Manuel must have had horrible\nsuspicions.\n\nMeanwhile, Dom Manuel affably shook hands with the red-headed boy, and\nspoke of their first meeting. \"And I believe you were not talking utter\nfoolishness after all, my lad,\" says Manuel, laughing, \"for I have\nlearned that the strange and dangerous thing which you told me is very\noften true.\"\n\n\"Why, how should I know,\" quiet Horvendile replied, \"when I am talking\nfoolishness and when not?\"\n\nManuel said: \"Still, I can understand your talking only in part. Well,\nbut it is not right for us to understand our overlords, and, madman or\nnot, I prefer you to Queen Stultitia and her preposterous rose-colored\nspectacles. So let us proceed in due form, and draw up the articles of\nour agreement.\"\n\nThis was done, and they formally subscribed the terms under which Dom\nManuel and the descendants of Dom Manuel were to hold Poictesme\nperpetually in fief to Horvendile. It was the most secret sort of\ncompact, and to divulge its ten stipulations would even now be most\ndisastrous. So the terms of this compact were not ever made public. Thus\nall men stayed at no larger liberty to criticize its provisos than his\ncircumstances had granted to Dom Manuel, upon whom marrying had put the\nobligation to provide, in one way or another way, for his wife and\nchild.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\nXXXII\n\n\nThe Redemption of Poictesme\n\n\nWhen then these matters were concluded, and the future of Poictesme had\nbeen arranged in every detail, then Miramon Lluagor's wife told him that\nlong words and ink-bottles and red seals were well enough for men to\nplay with, but that it was high time something sensible was done in this\nmatter, unless they expected Niafer to bring up the baby in a ditch.\n\nThe magician said, \"Yes, my darling, you are quite right, and I will see\nto it the first thing after dinner.\"\n\nHe then said to Dom Manuel, \"Now Horvendile informs me that you were\nduly born in a cave at about the time of the winter solstice, of a\nvirgin mother and of a father who was not human.\"\n\nManuel replied, \"Certainly that is true. But why do you now stir up\nthese awkward old stories?\"\n\n\"You have duly wandered from place to place, bringing wisdom and\nholiness to men--\"\n\n\"That also is generally known.\"\n\n\"You have duly performed miracles, such as reviving dead persons and so\non--\"\n\n\"That too is undeniable.\"\n\n\"You have duly sojourned with evil in a desert place, and have there\nbeen tempted to despair and blaspheme and to commit other iniquities.\"\n\n\"Yes, something of the sort did occur in Dun Vlechlan.\"\n\n\"And, as I well know, you have by your conduct of affairs upon Vraidex\nduly disconcerted me, who am the power of darkness--\"\n\n\"Ah! ah! you, Miramon, are then the power of darkness!\"\n\n\"I control all dreams and madnesses, Dom Manuel; and these are the main\npowers of darkness.\"\n\nManuel seemed dubious, but he only said: \"Well, let us get on! It is\ntrue that all these things have happened to me, somehow.\"\n\nThe magician looked at the tall warrior for a while, and in the dark\nsoft eyes of Miramon Lluagor was a queer sort of compassion. Miramon\nsaid, \"Yes, Manuel, these portents have marked your living thus far,\njust as they formerly distinguished the beginnings of Mithras and of\nHuitzilopochtli and of Tammouz and of Heracles--\"\n\n\"Yes, but what does it matter if these accidents did happen to me,\nMiramon?\"\n\n\"--As they happened to Gautama and to Dionysos and to Krishna and to all\nother reputable Redeemers,\" Miramon continued.\n\n\"Well, well, all this is granted. But what, pray, am I to deduce from\nall this?\"\n\nMiramon told him.\n\nDom Manuel, at the end of Miramon's speaking, looked peculiarly solemn,\nand Manuel said: \"I had thought the transformation surprising enough\nwhen King Ferdinand was turned into a saint, but this tops all! Either\nway, Miramon, you point out an obligation so tremendous that the less\nsaid about it, the wiser; and the sooner this obligation is discharged\nand the ritual fulfilled, the more comfortable it will be for\neverybody.\"\n\nSo Manuel went away with Miramon Lluagor into a secret place, and there\nDom Manuel submitted to that which was requisite, and what happened is\nnot certainly known. But this much is known, that Manuel suffered, and\nafterward passed three days in an underground place, and came forth on\nthe third day.\n\nThen Miramon said: \"All this being duly performed and well rid of, we do\nnot now violate any messianic etiquette if we forthwith set about the\nredemption of Poictesme. Now then, would you prefer to redeem with the\nforces of good or with the forces of evil?\"\n\n\"Not with the forces of evil,\" said Manuel, \"for I saw many of these in\nthe high woods of Dun Vlechlan, and I do not fancy them as allies. But\nare good and evil all one to you of the L\u00e9shy?\"\n\n\"Why should we tell you, Manuel?\" says the magician.\n\n\"That, Miramon, is a musty reply.\"\n\n\"It is not a reply, it is a question. And the question has become musty\nbecause it has been handled so often, and no man has ever been able to\ndispose of it.\"\n\nManuel gave it up, and shrugged. \"Well, let us conquer as we may, so\nthat God be on our side.\"\n\nMiramon replied: \"Never fear! He shall be, in every shape and\nattribute.\"\n\nSo Miramon did what was requisite, and from the garrets and dustheaps of\nVraidex came strong allies. For, to begin with, Miramon dealt unusually\nwith a little fish, and as a result of these dealings came to them,\nduring the afternoon of the last Thursday in September, as they stood on\nthe seashore north of Manneville, a darkly colored champion clad in\nyellow. He had four hands, in which he carried a club, a shell, a lotus\nand a discus; and he rode upon a stallion whose hide glittered like new\nsilver.\n\nManuel said, \"This is a good omen, that the stallion of Poictesme should\nhave aid brought to it by yet another silver stallion.\"\n\n\"Let us not speak of this bright stallion,\" Miramon hastily replied,\n\"for until this Yuga is over he has no name. But when the minds of all\nmen are made clear as crystal then a christening will be appointed for\nthis stallion, and his name will be Kalki, and by the rider upon this\nstallion Antan will be redeemed.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Manuel said, \"that seems fair enough. Meanwhile, with this dusky\ngentleman's assistance, I gather, we are to redeem Poictesme.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Dom Manuel, he is but the first of our Redeemers, for there is\nnothing like the decimal system, and you will remember it was in our\ntreaty that in Poictesme all things are to go by tens forever.\"\n\nThereafter Miramon did what was requisite with some acorns, and the\nsplutterings were answered by low thunder. So came a second champion to\naid them. This was a pleasant looking young fellow with an astonishingly\nred beard: he had a basket slung over his shoulder, and he carried a\nbright hammer. He rode in a chariot drawn by four goats.\n\n\"Come, this is certainly a fine stalwart fighting-man,\" says Manuel,\n\"and to-day is a lucky day for me, and for this ruddy gentleman also, I\nhope.\"\n\n\"To-day is always his day,\" Miramon replied, \"and do you stop\ninterrupting me in my incantations, and hand me that flute.\"\n\nSo Manuel stayed as silent as that brace of monstrous allies while\nMiramon did yet another curious thing with a flute and a palm-branch.\nThereafter came an amber-colored champion clad in dark green, and\ncarrying a club and a noose for the souls of the dead. He rode upon a\nbuffalo, and with him came an owl and a pigeon.\n\n\"I think--\" said Manuel.\n\n\"You do not!\" said Miramon. \"You only talk and fidget, because you are\nupset by the appearance of your allies; and such talking and fidgeting\nis very disturbing to an artist who is striving to reanimate the past.\"\n\nThus speaking, Miramon turned indignantly to another evocation. It\nsummoned a champion in a luminous chariot drawn by scarlet mares. He was\ngolden-haired, with ruddy limbs, and was armed with a bow and arrows: he\ntoo was silent, but he laughed, and you saw that he had several tongues.\nAfter him came a young shining man who rode on a boar with golden\nbristles and bloodied hoofs: this warrior carried a naked sword, and on\nhis back, folded up like a cloth, was a ship to contain the gods and all\nliving creatures. And the sixth Redeemer was a tall shadow-colored\nperson with two long gray plumes affixed to his shaven head: he carried\na sceptre and a thing which, Miramon said, was called an ankh, and the\nbeast he rode on was surprising to observe, for it had the body of a\nbeetle, with human arms, and the head of a ram, and the four feet of a\nlion.\n\n\"Come,\" Manuel said, \"but I have never seen just such a steed as that.\"\n\n\"No,\" Miramon replied, \"nor has anybody else, for this is the Hidden\nOne. But do you stop your eternal talking, and pass me the salt and that\nyoung crocodile.\"\n\nWith these two articles Miramon dealt so as to evoke a seventh ally.\nSerpents were about the throat and arms of this champion, and he wore a\nnecklace of human skulls: his long black hair was plaited remarkably;\nhis throat was blue, his body all a livid white except where it was\nsmeared with ashes. He rode upon the back of a beautiful white bull.\nNext, riding on a dappled stag, came one appareled in vivid stripes of\nyellow and red and blue and green: his face was dark as a raincloud, he\nhad one large round eye, white tusks protruded from his lips, and he\ncarried a gaily painted urn. His unspeakable attendants leaped like\nfrogs. The jolliest looking of all the warriors came thereafter, with a\ndwarfish body and very short legs; he had a huge black-bearded head, a\nflat nose, and his tongue hung from his mouth and waggled as he moved.\nHe wore a belt and a necklace, and nothing else whatever except the\nplumes of the hawk arranged as a head-dress: and he rode upon a great\nsleek tortoise-shell cat.\n\nNow when these unusual appearing allies stood silently aligned before\nthem on the seashore, Dom Manuel said, with a polite bow toward this\nappalling host, that he hardly thought Duke Asmund would be able to\nwithstand such Redeemers. But Miramon repeated that there was nothing\nlike the decimal system.\n\n\"That half-brother of mine, who is lord of the tenth kind of sleeping,\nwould nicely round off this dizain,\" says Miramon, scratching his chin,\n\"if only he had not such a commonplace, black-and-white appearance,\napart from being one of those dreadful Realists, without a scrap of\naesthetic feeling--No, I like color, and we will levy now upon the\nWest!\"\n\nSo Miramon dealt next with a little ball of bright feathers. Then a last\nhelper came to them, riding on a jaguar, and carrying a large drum and a\nflute from which his music issued in the shape of flames. This champion\nwas quite black, but he was striped with blue paint, and golden feathers\ngrew all over his left leg. He wore a red coronet in the shape of a\nrose, a short skirt of green paper, and white sandals; and he carried a\nred shield that had in its centre a white flower with the four petals\nplaced crosswise. Such was he who made up the tenth.\n\nNow when this terrible dizain was completed the lord of the seven\nmadnesses laid fire to a wisp of straw, and he cast it to the winds,\nsaying that thus should the anger of Miramon Lluagor pass over the land.\nThen he turned to these dreadful ten whom he had revivified from the\ndustheaps and garrets of Vraidex, and it became apparent that Miramon\nwas deeply moved.\n\nSaid Miramon:\n\n\"You, whom I made for man's worship when earth was younger and fairer,\nhearken, and learn why I breathe new life into husks from my\nscrap-heaps! Gods of old days, discrowned, disjected, and treated as\nrubbish, hark to the latest way of the folk whose fathers you succored!\nThey have discarded you utterly. Such as remember deride you, saying:\n\n\"'The brawling old lords that our grandfathers honored have perished, if\nthey indeed were ever more than some curious notions bred of our\ngrandfathers' questing, that looked to find God in each rainstorm coming\nto nourish their barley, and God in the heat-bringing sun, and God in\nthe earth which gave life. Even so was each hour of their living touched\nwith odd notions of God and with lunacies as to God's kindness. We are\nmore sensible people, for we understand all about the freaks of the wind\nand the weather, and find them in no way astounding. As for whatever\ngods may exist, they are civil, in that they let us alone in our\nlifetime; and so we return their politeness, knowing that what we are\ndoing on earth is important enough to need undivided attention.'\n\n\"Such are the folk that deride you, such are the folk that ignore the\ngods whom Miramon fashioned, such are the folk whom to-day I permit you\nfreely to deal with after the manner of gods. Do you now make the most\nof your chance, and devastate all Poictesme in time for an earlyish\nsupper!\"\n\nThe faces of these ten became angry, and they shouted, \"Blaerde Shay\nAlphenio Kasbue Gorfons Albuifrio!\"\n\nAll ten went up together from the sea, traveling more swiftly than men\ntravel, and what afterward happened in Poictesme was for a long while a\nstory very fearful to hear and heard everywhere.\n\nManuel did not witness any of the tale's making as he waited alone on\nthe seashore. But the land was sick, and its nausea heaved under\nManuel's wounded feet, and he saw that the pale, gurgling, glistening\nsea appeared to crawl away from Poictesme slimily. And at Bellegarde and\nNaimes and Storisende and Lisuarte, and in all the strongly fortified\ninland places, Asmund's tall fighting-men beheld one or another of the\nangry faces which came up from the sea, and many died swiftly, as must\nalways happen when anybody revives discarded dreams, nor did any of the\nNorthmen die in a shape recognizable as human.\n\nWhen the news was brought to Dom Manuel that his redemption of Poictesme\nwas completed, then Dom Manuel unarmed, and made himself presentable in\na tunic of white damask and a girdle adorned with garnets and sapphires.\nHe slipped over his left shoulder a baldric set with diamonds and\nemeralds, to sustain the unbloodied sword with which he had conquered\nhere as upon Vraidex. Over all he put on a crimson mantle. Then the\nformer swineherd concealed his hands, not yet quite healed, with white\ngloves, of which the one was adorned with a ruby, and the other was a\nsapphire; and, sighing, Manuel the Redeemer (as he was called\nthereafter) entered into his kingdom, and they of Poictesme received him\nfar more gladly than he them.\n\nThus did Dom Manuel enter into the imprisonment of his own castle and\ninto the bonds of high estate, from which he might not easily get free\nto go a-traveling everywhither, and see the ends of this world and judge\nthem. And they say that in her low red-pillared palace Suskind smiled\ncontentedly and made ready for the future.\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nPART FIVE.\n\n\nTHE BOOK OF SETTLEMENT\n\n\nTO\n\nJOSEPH HERGESHEIMER\n\n\n\nThus _Manuel reigned in vertue and honoure with that noble Ladye his\nwyfe: and he was beloued and dradde of high and lowe degree, for he dyde\nryghte and iustice_ according to the auncient Manner, _kepynge hys land\nin dignitie and goode Appearance, and hauynge the highest place in hys\ntyme._\n\n\n\nXXXIII\n\n\nNow Manuel Prospers\n\n\nThey of Poictesme narrate fine tales as to the deeds that Manuel the\nRedeemer performed and incited in the days of his reign. They tell also\nmany things that seem improbable, and therefore are not included in this\nbook: for the old songs and tales incline to make of Count Manuel's\nheydey a rare golden age.\n\nSo many glorious exploits are, indeed, accredited to Manuel and to the\nwarriors whom he gathered round him in his famous Fellowship of the\nSilver Stallion,--and among whom, Holden and courteous Anavalt and Coth\nthe Alderman and Gonfal and Donander had the pre-eminence, where all\nwere hardy,--that it is very difficult to understand how so brief a\nwhile could have continued so many doings. But the tale-tellers of\nPoictesme have been long used to say of a fine action,--not falsely, but\nmisleadingly,--\"Thus it was in Count Manuel's time,\" and the tribute by\nand by has been accepted as a dating. So has chronology been hacked to\nmake loftier his fame, and the glory of Dom Manuel has been a magnet\nthat has drawn to itself the magnanimities of other days and years.\n\nBut there is no need here to speak of these legends, about the deeds\nwhich were performed by the Fellowship of the Silver Stallion, because\nthese stories are recorded elsewhere. Some may be true, the others are\ncertainly not true; but it is indisputable that Count Manuel grew\nsteadily in power and wealth and proud repute. Miramon Lluagor still\nserved him, half-amusedly, as Dom Manuel's seneschal; kings now were\nManuel's co-partners; and the former swineherd had somehow become the\nfair and trusty cousin of emperors. And Madame Niafer, the great Count's\nwife, was everywhere stated, without any contradiction from her, to be\ndaughter to the late Soldan of Barbary.\n\nGuivric the Sage illuminated the tree which showed the glorious descent\nof Dame Niafer from Kaiumarth, the first of all kings, and the first to\nteach men to build houses: and this tree hung in the main hall of\nStorisende. \"For even if some errors may have crept in here and there,\"\nsaid Dame Niafer, \"it looks very well.\"\n\n\"But, my dear,\" said Manuel, \"your father was not the Soldan of Barbary:\ninstead, he was the second groom at Arnaye, and all this lineage is a\npreposterous fabrication.\"\n\n\"I said just now that some errors may have crept in here and there,\"\nassented Dame Niafer, composedly, \"but the point is, that the thing\nreally looks very well, and I do not suppose that even you deny that.\"\n\n\"No, I do not deny that this glowing mendacity adds to the hall's\nappearance.\"\n\n\"So now, you see for yourself!\" said Niafer, triumphantly. And after\nthat her new ancestry was never questioned.\n\nAnd in the meanwhile Dom Manuel had sent messengers over land and sea to\nhis half-sister Math at Rathgor, bidding her sell the mill for what it\nwould fetch. She obeyed, and brought to Manuel's court her husband and\ntheir two boys, the younger of whom rose later to be Pope of Rome.\nManuel gave the miller the vacant fief of Montors; and thereafter you\ncould nowhere have found a statelier fine lady than the Countess\nMatthiette de Montors. She was still used to speak continually of what\nwas becoming to people of our station in life, but it was with a large\ndifference; and she got on with Niafer as well as could be expected, but\nno better.\n\nAnd early in the summer of the first year of Manuel's reign (just after\nDom Manuel fetched to Storisende the Sigel of Scoteia, as the spoils of\nhis famous fight with Oriander the Swimmer), the stork brought to Niafer\nthe first of the promised boys. For the looks of the thing, this child\nwas named, not after the father whom Manuel had just killed, but after\nthe Emmerick who was Manuel's nominal father: and it was this Emmerick\nthat afterward reigned long and notably in Poictesme.\n\nSo matters went prosperously with Dom Manuel, and there was nothing to\ntrouble his peace of mind, unless it were some feeling of responsibility\nfor the cult of Sesphra, whose worship was now increasing everywhere\namong the nations. In Philistia, in particular, Sesphra was now\nworshipped openly in the legislative halls and churches, and all other\nreligion, and all decency, was smothered under the rituals of Sesphra.\nEverywhere to the west and north his followers were delivering windy\ndiscourses and performing mad antics, and great hurt came of it all by\nand by. But if this secretly troubled Dom Manuel; the Count, here as\nelsewhere, exercised to good effect his invaluable gift for holding his\ntongue.\n\nNor did he ever speak of Freydis either, though it is recorded that when\nnews came of the end which she had made in Teamhair under the oppression\nof the Druids and the satirists, Dom Manuel went silently into the Room\nof Ageus, and was not seen any more that day. That in such solitude he\nwept is improbable, for his hard vivid eyes had forgotten this way of\nexercise, but it is highly probable that he remembered many things, and\nfound not all of them to his credit.\n\nSo matters went prosperously with gray Manuel; he had lofty palaces and\nfair woods and pastures and ease and content, and whensoever he went\ninto battle attended by his nine lords of the Silver Stallion, his\nadversaries perished; he was esteemed everywhere the most lucky and the\nleast scrupulous rogue alive: to crown all which the stork brought by\nand by to Storisende the second girl, whom they named Dorothy, for\nManuel's mother. And about this time too, came a young poet from England\n(Ribaut they called him, and he met an evil end at Coventry not long\nthereafter), bringing to Dom Manuel, where the high Count sat at supper,\na goose-feather.\n\nThe Count smiled, and he twirled the thing between his fingers, and he\nmeditated. He shrugged, and said: \"Needs must. But for her ready wit, my\nhead would have been set to dry on a silver pike. I cannot well ignore\nthat obligation, if she, as it now seems, does not intend to ignore it.\"\n\nThen he told Niafer he must go into England.\n\nNiafer looked up from the marmalade with which she was finishing off her\nsupper, to ask placidly, \"And what does that dear yellow-haired friend\nof yours want with you now?\"\n\n\"My dear, if I knew the answer to that question it would not be\nnecessary for me to travel oversea.\"\n\n\"It is easy enough to guess, though,\" Dame Niafer said darkly, although,\nin point of fact, she too was wondering why Alianora should have sent\nfor Manuel; \"and I can quite understand how in your sandals you prefer\nnot to have people know about such doings, and laughing at you\neverywhere, again.\"\n\nDom Manuel did not reply; but he sighed.\n\n\"--And if any importance whatever were attached to my opinion in this\nhouse I might be saying a few things; but, as it is, it is much more\nagreeable, all around, to let you go your own hard-headed way and find\nout by experience that what I say is true. So now, Manuel, if you do not\nmind, I think we had better be talking about something else a little\nmore pleasant.\"\n\nDom Manuel still did not say anything. The time, as has been noted, was\njust after supper, and as the high Count and his wife sat over the\nremnants of this meal, a minstrel was making music for them.\n\n\"You are not very cheerful company, I must say,\" Niafer observed, in a\nwhile, \"although I do not for a moment doubt your yellow-haired friend\nwill find you gay enough--\"\n\n\"No, Niafer, I am not happy to-night.\"\n\n\"Yes, and whose fault is it? I told you not to take two helpings of that\nbeef.\"\n\n\"No, no, dear snip, it is not indigestion, but rather it is that music,\nwhich is plaguing me.\"\n\n\"Now, Manuel, how can music bother anybody! I am sure the boy plays his\nviolin very nicely indeed, especially when you consider his age.\"\n\nSaid Manuel:\n\n\"Yes, but the long low sobbing of the violin, troubling as the vague\nthoughts begotten by that season wherein summer is not yet perished from\nthe earth, but lingers wanly in the tattered shrines of summer, speaks\nof what was and of what might have been. A blind desire, the same which\non warm moonlit nights was used to shake like fever in the veins of a\nboy whom I remember, is futilely plaguing a gray fellow with the gray\nwraiths of innumerable old griefs and with small stinging memories of\nlong-dead delights. Such thirsting breeds no good for staid and aging\nmen, but my lips are athirst for lips whose loveliness no longer exists\nin flesh, and I thirst for a dead time and its dead fervors to be\nreviving, so that young Manuel may love again.\n\n\"To-night now surely somewhere, while this music sets uncertain and\nprobing fingers to healed wounds, an aging woman, in everything a\nstranger to me, is troubled just thus futilely, and she too remembers\nwhat she half forgets. 'We that of old were one, and shuddered heart to\nheart, with our young lips and our souls too made indivisible,'--thus\nshe is thinking, as I think--'has life dealt candidly in leaving us to\npotter with half measures and to make nothing of severed lives that\nshrivel far apart?' Yes, she to-night is sad as I, it well may be; but I\ncannot rest certain of this, because there is in young love a glory so\nbedazzling as to prevent the lover from seeing clearly his\nco-worshipper, and therefore in that dear time when we served love\ntogether I learned no more of her than she of me.\n\n\"Of all my failures this is bitterest to bear, that out of so much\ngrieving and aspiring I have gained no assured knowledge of the woman\nherself, but must perforce become lachrymose over such perished tinsels\nas her quivering red lips and shining hair! Of youth and love is there\nno more, then, to be won than virginal breasts and a small white belly\nyielded to the will of the lover, and brief drunkenness, and afterward\nsuch puzzled yearning as now dies into acquiescence, very much as the\nlong low sobbing of that violin yonder dies into stillness now the song\nis done?\"\n\nSo it was that gray Manuel talked in a half voice, sitting there\nresplendently robed in gold and crimson, and twiddling between his\nfingers a goose-feather.\n\n\"Yes,\" Niafer said, presently, \"but, for my part, I think he plays very\nnicely indeed.\"\n\nManuel gave an abrupt slight jerking of the head. Dom Manuel laughed.\n\"Dear snip,\" said he, \"come, honestly now, what have you been meditating\nabout while I talked nonsense?\"\n\n\"Why, I was thinking I must remember to look over your flannels the\nfirst thing to-morrow, Manuel, for everybody knows what that damp\nEnglish climate is in autumn--\"\n\n\"My dearest,\" Manuel said, with grave conviction, \"you are the archetype\nand flawless model of all wives.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\nXXXIV\n\n\nFarewell to Alianora\n\n\nNow Dom Manuel takes ship and goes into England: and for what happened\nthere we have no authority save the account which Dom Manuel rendered on\nhis return to his wife.\n\nThus said Dom Manuel:\n\nHe went straight to Woodstock, where the King and Queen then were. At\nWoodstock Dom Manuel was handsomely received, and there he passed the\nmonth of September--\n\n(_\"Why need you stay so long, though?\" Dame Niafer inquired.\n\n\"Well,\" Manuel explained, \"one thing led to another, as it were.\"\n\n\"H'm!\" Niafer remarked._)\n\nHe had presently a private talk with the Queen. How was she dressed? As\nnear as Manuel recalled, she wore a green mantle fastened in front with\na square fermoir of gems and wrought gold; under it, a close fitting\ngown of gold-diapered brocade, with tight sleeves so long that they half\ncovered her hands, something like mitts. Her crown was of floriated\ntrefoils surmounting a band of rubies. Of course, though, they might\nhave been only garnets--\n\n(_\"And where was it that she dressed up in all this finery to talk with\nyou in private?\"\n\n\"Why, at Woodstock, naturally.\"\n\n\"I know it was at Woodstock, but whereabouts at Woodstock?\"\n\n\"It was by a window, my dear, by a window with panes of white glass and\nwooden lattices and a pent covered with lead.\"\n\n\"Your account is very circumstantial, but where was the window?\"\n\n\"Oh, now I understand you! It was in a room.\"\n\n\"What sort of room?\"\n\n\"Well, the walls were covered with gay frescoes from Saxon history; the\nfireplace was covered with very handsomely carved stone dragons; and the\nfloor was covered with new rushes. Indeed, the Queen has one of the\nneatest bedrooms I have ever seen.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" said Niafer: \"and what did you talk about during the time\nthat you spent in your dear friend's bedroom?\"_)\n\nWell, he found all going well with Queen Alianora (Dom Manuel continued)\nexcept that she had not yet provided an heir for the English throne, and\nit was this alone which was troubling her. It was on account of this\nthat she had sent for Count Manuel.\n\n\"It is considered not to look at all well, after three years of\nmarriage,\" the Queen told him, \"and people are beginning to say a number\nof unkind things.\"\n\n\"It is the common fate of queens,\" Dom Manuel replies, \"to be exposed to\nthe criticism of envious persons.\"\n\n\"No, do not be brilliant and aphoristic, Manuel, for I want you to help\nme more practically in this matter.\"\n\n\"Very willingly will I help you if I can. But how can I?\"\n\n\"Why, you must assist me in getting a baby,--a boy baby, of course.\"\n\n\"I am willing to do all that I can, because certainly it does not look\nwell for you to have no son to be King of England. But how can I, of all\npersons, help you in this affair?\"\n\n\"Now, Manuel, after getting three children you surely ought to know what\nis necessary!\"\n\nDom Manuel shook a gray head. \"My children came from a source which is\nexhausted.\"\n\n\"That would be deplorable news if I believed it, but I am sure that if\nyou will let me take matters in hand I can convince you to the\ncontrary--\"\n\n\"Well, I am open to conviction.\"\n\n\"--Although I scarcely know how to begin, because I know that you will\nthink this hard on you--\"\n\nHe took her hand. Dom Manuel admitted to Niafer without reserve that\nhere he took the Queen's hand, saying: \"Do not play with me any longer,\nAlianora, for you must see plainly that I am now eager to serve you. So\ndo not be embarrassed, but come to the point, and I will do what I can.\"\n\n\"Why, Manuel, both you and I know perfectly well that, even with your\nDorothy ordered, you still hold the stork's note for another girl and\nanother boy, to be supplied upon demand, after the manner of the\nPhilistines.\"\n\n\"No, not upon demand, for the first note has nine months to run, and the\nother falls due even later. But what has that to do with it?\"\n\n\"Now, Manuel, truly I hate to ask this of you, but my need is desperate,\nwith all this criticizing and gossip. So for old time's sake, and for\nthe sake of the life I gave you as a Christmas present, through telling\nmy dear father an out-and-out story, you must let me have that first\npromissory note, and you must direct the stork to bring the boy baby to\nme in England, and not to your wife in Poictesme.\"\n\nSo that was what Dame Alianora had wanted.\n\n(_\"I knew that all along\" observed Dame Niafer,--untruthfully, but\nadhering to her general theory that it was better to appear omniscient\nin dealing with one's husband._)\n\nWell, Dom Manuel was grieved by the notion of being parted from his\nchild prior to its birth, but he was moved alike by his former fondness\nfor Alianora, and by his indebtedness to her, and by the obligation that\nwas on him to provide as handsomely as possible for his son. Nobody\ncould dispute that as King of England, the boy's station in life would\nbe immeasurably above the rank of the Count of Poictesme's younger\nbrother. So Manuel made a complaint as to his grief and as to Niafer's\ngrief at thus prematurely losing their loved son--\n\n(_\"Shall I repeat what I said, my dear?\"\n\n\"No, Manuel, I never understand you when you are trying to be highflown\nand impressive.\"_)\n\nWell, then, Dom Manuel made a very beautiful complaint, but in the\noutcome Dom Manuel consented to this sacrifice.\n\nHe would not consent, though, to remain in England, as Alianora wanted\nhim to do.\n\n\"No,\" he said, nobly, \"it would not look at all well for you to be\ntaking me as your lover, and breaking your marriage-vows to love nobody\nbut the King. No, Alianora, I will help you to get the baby you need,\ninasmuch as I am indebted to you for my life and have two babies to\nspare, but I am not willing to have anything to do with the breaking of\nyour marriage-vows, because it is a crime which is forbidden by the Holy\nScriptures, and of which Niafer would certainly hear sooner or later.\"\n\n(_\"Oh, Manuel, you did not say that!\"\n\n\"My dear, those were my exact words. And why not?\"\n\n\"That was putting it sensibly of course, but it would have sounded much\nbetter if you had expressed yourself entirely upon moral grounds. It is\nmost important, Manuel, as I am sure I have told you over and over\nagain, for people in our position to show a proper respect for morality\nand religion and things of that sort whenever they come up in the\nconversation; but there is no teaching you anything except by bitter\nexperience, which I sincerely hope may be spared you, and one might as\nwell be arguing with a brick wall, and so you may go on\"_)\n\nWell, the Queen wept and coaxed, but Manuel was firm. So Manuel spent\nthat night in the Queen's room, performing the needful incantations, and\narranging matters with the stork, and then Dom Manuel returned home. And\nthat--well, really that was all.\n\nSuch was the account which Dom Manuel rendered his wife. \"And upon the\nwhole, Niafer, I consider it a very creditable stroke of business, for\nas King of England the child will enjoy advantages which we could never\nhave afforded him.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Niafer, \"and what does that dear friend of yours look like\nnowadays?\"\n\n\"--Besides, should the boy turn out badly our grief will be considerably\nlessened by the circumstance that, through never seeing this son of\nours, our affection for him will never be inconveniently great.\"\n\n\"There is something in that, for already I can see that Emmerick\ninherits his father's obstinacy, and it naturally worries me, but what\ndoes the woman look like nowadays?\"\n\n\"--Then, even more important than these considerations--.\"\n\n\"Nothing is more important, Manuel, in this very curious sounding\naffair, than the way that woman looks nowadays.\"\n\n\"Ah, my dear,\" says Manuel, diplomatically, \"I did not like to speak of\nthat, I confess, for you know these blondes go off in their appearance\nso quickly--\"\n\n\"Of course they do, but still--\"\n\n\"--And it not being her fault, after all, I did not like to tell you\nabout Dame Alianora's looking so many years older than you do, since\nyour being a brunette gives you an unfair advantage to begin with.\"\n\n\"Ah, it is not that,\" said Niafer, still rather grim-visaged, but\nobviously mollified. \"It is the life she is leading, with her witchcraft\nand her familiar spirits and that continual entertaining and excitement,\nand everybody tells me she has already taken to dyeing her hair.\"\n\n\"Oh, it had plainly had something done to it,\" says Manuel, lightly.\n\"But it is a queen's duty to preserve such remnants of good looks as she\npossesses.\"\n\n\"So there, you see!\" said Niafer, quite comfortable again in her mind\nwhen she noted the careless way in which Dom Manuel spoke of the Queen.\n\nA year or two earlier Dame Niafer would perhaps have been moved to\njealousy: now her only concern was that Manuel might possibly be led to\nmake a fool of himself and to upset their manner of living. With every\ncontented wife her husband's general foolishness is an axiom, and\nprudent philosophers do not distinguish here between cause and effect.\n\nAs for Alianora's wanting to take Manuel as a lover, Dame Niafer found\nthe idea mildly amusing, and very nicely indicative of those washed-out,\nyellow-haired women's intelligence. To be harboring romantic notions\nabout Manuel seemed to Manuel's wife so fantastically out of reason that\nshe half wished the poor creature could without scandal be afforded a\nchance to find out for herself all about Manuel's thousand and one\nfinicky ways and what he was in general to live with.\n\nThat being impossible, Niafer put the crazy woman out of mind, and began\nto tell Manuel about what had happened, and not for the first time\neither, while he was away, and about just how much more she was going to\nstand from Sister Math, and about the advantages of a perfectly plain\nunderstanding for everybody concerned. And with Niafer that was the end\nof Count Manuel's discharging of his obligation to Alianora.\n\nOf course there were gossips who said this, that and the other. Some\nasserted that Manuel's tale in itself contained elements of\nimprobability: others declared that Queen Alianora, who was far deeplier\nversed in the magic of the Apsarasas than was Dom Manuel, could just as\nwell have summoned the stork without his assistance. It was true the\nstork was under no especial obligations to Alianora: even so, said these\ngossips, it would have looked far better, and a queen could not be too\nparticular, and it simply showed you about these foreign Southern women;\nand although they of course wished to misjudge no one, there was no\nsense in pretending to ignore what everybody practically knew to be a\nfact, and was talking about everywhere, and some day you would see for\nyourself.\n\nBut after all, Dom Manuel and the Queen were the only persons qualified\nto speak of these matters with authority, and this was Dom Manuel's\naccount of them. For the rest, he was sustained against tittle-tattle by\nthe knowledge that he had performed a charitable deed in England, for\nthe Queen's popularity was enhanced, and all the English, but\nparticularly their King, were delighted, by the fine son which the stork\nduly brought to Alianora the following June.\n\nManuel never saw this boy, who afterward ruled over England and was a\nhighly thought-of warrior, nor did Dom Manuel ever see Queen Alianora\nany more. So Alianora goes out of the story, to bring long years of\nmisery and ruining wars upon the English, and to Dom Manuel no more\nbeguilements. For they say Dom Manuel could never resist her, because of\nthat underlying poverty in the correct emotions which, as some say, Dom\nManuel shared with her, and which they hid from all the world except\neach other.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nXXXV\n\n\nThe Troubling Window\n\n\nIt seemed, in a word, that trouble had forgotten Count Manuel. None the\nless, Dom Manuel opened a window, at his fine home at Storisende, on a\nfine, sunlit, warmish morning (for this was the last day of April) to\nconfront an outlook more perturbing than his hard vivid eyes had yet\nlighted on.\n\nSo he regarded it for a while. Considerately Dom Manuel now made\nexperiments with three windows in this Room of Ageus, and found how, in\nso far as one's senses could be trusted, the matter stood. Thereafter,\nas became an intelligent person, he went back to his writing-table, and\nset about signing the requisitions and warrants and other papers which\nRuric the clerk had left there.\n\nYet all the while Dom Manuel's gaze kept lifting to the windows. There\nwere three of them, set side by side, each facing south. They were of\nthick clear glass, of a sort whose manufacture is a lost art, for these\nwindows had been among the spoils brought back by Duke Asmund from\nnefarious raidings of Philistia, in which country these windows had once\nbeen a part of the temple of Ageus, an immemorial god of the\nPhilistines. For this reason the room was called the Room of Ageus.\n\nThrough these windows Count Manuel could see familiar fields, the long\navenue of poplars and the rising hills beyond. All was as it had been\nyesterday, and as all had been since, nearly three years ago, Count\nManuel first entered Storisende. All was precisely as it had been,\nexcept, to be sure, that until yesterday Dom Manuel's table had stood by\nthe farthest window. He could not remember that until to-day this window\nhad ever been opened, because since his youth had gone out of him Count\nManuel was becoming more and more susceptible to draughts.\n\n\"It is certainly very curious,\" Dom Manuel said, aloud, when he had\nfinished with his papers.\n\nHe was again approaching the very curious window when his daughter\nMelicent, now nearly three years old, came noisily, and in an\nappallingly soiled condition, to molest him. She had bright beauty\nlater, but at three she was one of those children whom human powers\ncannot keep clean for longer than three minutes.\n\nDom Manuel kept for her especial delectation a small flat paddle on his\nwriting-table, and this he now caught up.\n\n\"Out of the room with you, little pest!\" he blustered, \"for I am busy.\"\n\nSo the child, as was her custom, ran back into the hallway, and stood\nthere, no longer in the room, but with one small foot thrust beyond the\ndoorsill, while she laughed up at her big father, and derisively stuck\nout a tiny curved red tongue at the famed overlord of Poictesme. Then\nDom Manuel, as was his custom, got down upon the floor to slap with his\npaddle at the intruding foot, and Melicent squealed with delight, and\npulled back her foot in time to dodge the paddle, and thrust out her\nother foot beyond the sill, and tried to withdraw that too before it was\nspanked.\n\nSo it was they gave over a quarter of an hour to rioting, and so it was\nthat grave young Ruric found them. Count Manuel rather sheepishly arose\nfrom the floor, and dusted himself, and sent Melicent into the buttery\nfor some sugar cakes. He told Ruric what were the most favorable terms\nhe could offer the burgesses of Narenta, and he gave Ruric the signed\nrequisitions.\n\nPresently, when Ruric had gone, Dom Manuel went again to the farthest\nwindow, opened it, and looked out once more. He shook his head, as one\nwho gives up a riddle. He armed himself, and rode over to Perdigon,\nwhither sainted King Ferdinand had come to consult with Manuel about\ncontriving the assassination of the Moorish general, Al-Mota-wakkil.\nThis matter Dom Manuel deputed to Guivric the Sage; and so was rid of\nit.\n\nIn addition, Count Manuel had on hand that afternoon an appeal to the\njudgment of God, over some rather valuable farming lands; but it was\nremarked by the spectators that he botched the unhorsing and severe\nwounding of Earl Ladinas, and conducted it rather as though Dom Manuel's\nheart were not in the day's business. Indeed, he had reason, for while\nsupernal mysteries were well enough if one were still a hare-brained\nlad, or even if one set out in due form to seek them, to find such\nmysteries obtruding themselves unsought into the home-life of a\nwell-thought-of nobleman was discomposing, and to have the windows of\nhis own house playing tricks on him seemed hardly respectable.\n\nAll that month, too, some memory appeared to trouble Dom Manuel, in the\nback of his mind, while the lords of the Silver Stallion were busied in\nthe pursuit of Othmar and Othmar's brigands in the Taunenfels: and as\nsoon as Dom Manuel had captured and hanged the last squad of these\nknaves, Dom Manuel rode home and looked out of the window, to find\nmatters unchanged.\n\nDom Manuel meditated. He sounded the gong for Ruric. Dom Manuel talked\nwith the clerk about this and that. Presently Dom Manuel said: \"But one\nstifles here. Open that window.\"\n\nThe clerk obeyed. Manuel at the writing-table watched him intently. But\nin opening the window the clerk had of necessity stood with his back\ntoward Count Manuel, and when Ruric turned, the dark young face of Ruric\nwas impassive.\n\nDom Manuel, playing with the jeweled chain of office about his neck,\nconsidered Ruric's face. Then Manuel said: \"That is all. You may go.\"\n\nBut Count Manuel's face was troubled, and for the rest of this day he\nkept an eye on Ruric the young clerk. In the afternoon it was noticeable\nthat this Ruric went often, on one pretext and another, into the Room of\nAgeus when nobody else was there. The next afternoon, in broad daylight,\nManuel detected Ruric carrying into the Room of Ageus, of all things, a\nlantern. The Count waited a while, then went into the room through its\none door. The room was empty. Count Manuel sat down and drummed with his\nfingers upon the top of his writing-table.\n\nAfter a while the third window was opened. Ruric the clerk climbed over\nthe sill. He blew out his lantern.\n\n\"You are braver than I,\" Count Manuel said, \"it may be. It is certain\nyou are younger. Once, Ruric, I would not have lured any dark and\nprim-voiced young fellow into attempting this adventure, but would have\nessayed it myself post-haste. Well, but I have other duties now, and\nappearances to keep up: and people would talk if they saw a\nwell-thought-of nobleman well settled in life climbing out of his own\nwindows, and there is simply no telling what my wife would think of it\"\n\nThe clerk had turned, startled, dropping his lantern with a small crash.\nHis hands went jerkily to his smooth chin, clutching it. His face was\nwhite as a leper's face, and his eyes now were wild and glittering, and\nhis head was drawn low between his black-clad shoulders, so that he\nseemed a hunchback as he confronted his master. Another queer thing\nManuel could notice, and it was that a great lock had been sheared away\nfrom the left side of Ruric's black hair.\n\n\"What have you learned,\" says Manuel, \"out yonder?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you,\" replied Ruric, laughing sillily, \"but in place of\nit, I will tell you a tale. Yes, yes, Count Manuel, I will tell you a\nmerry story of how a great while ago our common grandmother Eve was\nwashing her children one day near Eden when God called to her. She hid\naway the children that she had not finished washing: and when the good\nGod asked her if all her children were there, with their meek little\nheads against His knees, to say their prayers to Him, she answered, Yes.\nSo God told her that what she had tried to hide from God should be\nhidden from men: and He took away the unwashed children, and made a\nplace for them where everything stays young, and where there is neither\ngood nor evil, because these children are unstained by human sin and\nunredeemed by Christ's dear blood.\"\n\nThe Count said, frowning: \"What drunken nonsense are you talking at\nbroad noon? It is not any foolish tatter of legend that I am requiring\nof you, my boy, but civil information as to what is to be encountered\nout yonder.\"\n\n\"All freedom and all delight,\" young Ruric told him wildly, \"and all\nhorror and all rebellion.\"\n\nThen he talked for a while. When Ruric had ended this talking, Count\nManuel laughed scornfully, and spoke as became a well-thought-of\nnobleman.\n\nRuric whipped out a knife, and attacked his master, crying, \"I follow\nafter my own thinking and my own desires, you old, smug, squinting\nhypocrite!\"\n\nSo Count Manuel caught Ruric by the throat, and with naked hands Dom\nManuel strangled the young clerk.\n\n\"Now I have ridded the world of much poison, I think,\" Dom Manuel said,\naloud, when Ruric lay dead at Manuel's feet. \"In any event, I cannot\nhave that sort of talking about my house. Yet I wish I had not trapped\nthe boy into attempting this adventure, which by rights was my\nadventure. I did not always avoid adventures.\"\n\nHe summoned two to take away the body, and then Manuel went to his\nbedroom, and was clothed by his lackeys in a tunic of purple silk, and a\ncoronet was placed on his gray head, and the trumpets sounded as Count\nManuel sat down to supper. Pages in ermine served him, bringing Manuel's\nfood upon gold dishes, and pouring red wine and white from golden\nbeakers into Manuel's gold cup. Skilled music-men played upon viols and\nharps and flutes while the high Count of Poictesme ate richly seasoned\nfood and talked sedately with his wife.\n\nThey had not fared thus when Manuel had just come from herding swine,\nand Niafer was a servant trudging on her mistress' errands, and when\nthese two had eaten very gratefully the Portune's bread and cheese. They\nhad not any need to be heartened with rare wines when they endured so\nmany perils upon Vraidex and in Dun Vlechlan because of their love for\neach other. For these two had once loved marvelously. Now minstrels\neverywhere made songs about their all-conquering love, which had derided\ndeath; and nobody denied that, even now, these two got on together\namicably.\n\nBut to-night Dame Niafer was fretted, because the pastry-cook was young\nRuric's cousin, and was, she feared, as likely as not to fling off in a\nhuff on account of Dom Manuel's having strangled the clerk.\n\n\"Well, then do you raise the fellow's wages,\" said Count Manuel.\n\n\"That is easily said, and is exactly like a man. Why, Manuel, you surely\nknow that then the meat-cook, and the butler, too, would be demanding\nmore, and that there would be no end to it.\"\n\n\"But, my dear, the boy was talking mad blasphemy, and was for cutting my\nthroat with a great horn-handled knife.\"\n\n\"Of course that was very wrong of him,\" said Dame Niafer, comfortably,\n\"and not for an instant, Manuel, am I defending his conduct, as I trust\nyou quite understand. But even so, if you had stopped for a moment to\nthink how hard it is to replace a servant nowadays, and how unreliable\nis the best of them, I believe you would have seen how completely we are\nat their mercy.\"\n\nThen she told him all about her second waiting-woman, while Manuel said,\n\"Yes,\" and \"I never heard the like,\" and \"You were perfectly right, my\ndear,\" and so on, and all the while appeared to be thinking about\nsomething else in the back of his mind.\n\n\n\nXXXVI\n\n\nExcursions from Content\n\n\nThereafter Count Manuel could not long remain away from the window\nthrough which Ruric had climbed with a lantern, and through which Ruric\nhad returned insanely blaspheming against law and order.\n\nThe outlook from this window was somewhat curious. Through the two other\nwindows of Ageus, set side by side with this one, and in appearance\nsimilar to it in all respects, the view remained always unchanged, and\njust such as it was from the third window so long as you looked through\nthe thick clear glass. But when the third window of Ageus was opened,\nall the sunlit summer world that you had seen through the thick clear\nglass was gone quite away, and you looked out into a limitless gray\ntwilight wherein not anything was certainly discernible, and the air\nsmelt of spring. It was a curious experience for Count Manuel, thus to\nregard through the clear glass his prospering domains and all the\nrewards of his famous endeavors, and then find them vanished as soon as\nthe third window was opened. It was curious, and very interesting; but\nsuch occurrences make people dubious about things in which, as everybody\nknows, it is wisdom's part to believe implicitly.\n\nNow the second day\nafter Ruric had died, the season now being June, Count Manuel stood at\nthe three windows, and saw in the avenue of poplars his wife, Dame\nNiafer, walking hand in hand with little Melicent. Niafer, despite her\nlameness, was a fine figure of a woman, so long as he viewed Niafer\nthrough the closed window of Ageus. Dom Manuel looked contentedly enough\nupon the wife who was the reward of his toil and suffering in Dun\nVlechlan, and the child who was the reward of his amiability and\nshrewdness in dealing with the stork, all seemed well so long as he\nregarded them through the closed third window.\n\nHis hand trembled somewhat as he now opened this window, to face gray\nsweetly-scented nothingness. But in the window glass, you saw, the\nappearance of his flourishing gardens remained unchanged: and in the\nhalf of the window to the right hand were quivering poplars, and Niafer\nand little Melicent were smiling at him, and the child was kissing her\nhand to him. All about this swinging half of the window was nothingness;\nhe, leaning out, and partly closing this half of the window, could see\nthat behind the amiable picture was nothingness: it was only in the old\nglass of Ageus that his wife and child appeared to live and move.\n\nDom Manuel laughed, shortly. \"Hah, then,\" says he, \"that tedious dear\nnagging woman and that priceless snub-nosed brat may not be real. They\nmay be merely happy and prosaic imaginings, hiding the night which alone\nis real. To consider this possibility is troubling. It makes for even\ngreater loneliness. None the less, I know that I am real, and certainly\nthe grayness before me is real. Well, no matter what befell Ruric\nyonder, it must be that in this grayness there is some other being who\nis real and dissatisfied. I must go to seek this being, for here I\nbecome as a drugged person among sedate and comfortable dreams which are\nmade doubly weariful by my old master's whispering of that knowledge\nwhich was my father's father's.\"\n\nThen in the gray dusk was revealed a face that was not human, and the\nround toothless mouth of it spoke feebly, saying, \"I am Lubrican, and I\ncome to guide you if you dare follow.\"\n\n\"I have always thought that 'dare' was a quaint word,\" says Manuel, with\nthe lordly swagger which he kept for company.\n\nSo he climbed out of the third window of Ageus. When later he climbed\nback, a lock had been sheared from the side of his gray head.\n\nNow the tale tells that thereafter Dom Manuel was changed, and his\nattendants gossiped about it. Dame Niafer also was moved to mild\nwonderment over the change in him, but did not think it very important,\nbecause there is never any accounting for what a husband will do.\nBesides, there were other matters to consider, for at this time\nEasterlings came up from Piaja (which they had sacked) into the\nterritories of King Theodoret, and besieged Megaris, and the harried\nKing had sent messengers to Dom Manuel.\n\n\"But this is none of my affair,\" said Manuel, \"and I begin to tire of\nwarfare, and of catching cold by sleeping on hard-won battle-fields.\"\n\n\"You would not take cold, as I have told you any number of times,\"\ndeclared Niafer, \"if you would eat more green vegetables instead of\nstuffing yourself with meat, and did not insist on overheating yourself\nat the fighting. Still, you had better go.\"\n\n\"My dear, I shall do nothing of the sort.\"\n\n\"Yes, you had better go, for these Easterlings are notorious pagans--\"\n\n\"Now other persons have been pagans once upon a time, dear snip--\"\n\n\"A great many things are much worse, Manuel,\" says Niafer, with that\ndark implication before which Dom Manuel always fidgeted, because there\nwas no telling what it might mean. \"Yes, these Easterlings are quite\nnotorious pagans, and King Theodoret has at least the grace to call\nhimself a Christian, and, besides, it will give me a chance to get your\nrooms turned out and thoroughly cleaned.\"\n\nSo Manuel, as was his custom, did what Niafer thought best. Manuel\nsummoned his vassals, and brought together his nine lords of the\nFellowship of the Silver Stallion, and, without making any stir with\nhorns and clarions, came so swiftly and secretly under cover of night\nupon the heathen Easterlings that never was seen such slaughter and\nsorrow and destruction as Dom Manuel wrought upon those tall pagans\nbefore he sat down to breakfast.\n\nHe attacked from Sannazaro. The survivors therefore fled, having no\nchoice, through the fields east of Megaris. Manuel followed, and slew\nthem in the open.\n\nThe realm was thus rescued from dire peril, and Manuel was detained for\na while in Megaris, by the ensuing banquets and religious services and\nthe executions of the prisoners and the nonsense of the King's sister.\nFor this romantic and very pretty girl had set King Theodoret to\npestering Manuel with magniloquent offers of what Theodoret would do and\ngive if only the rescuer of Megaris would put aside his ugly crippled\nwife and marry the King's lovely sister.\n\nManuel laughed at him. Some say that Manuel and the King's sister\ndispensed with marriage: others accuse Dom Manuel of exhibiting a\ncontinence not very well suited to his exalted estate. It is certain, in\nany event, that he by and by returned into Poictesme, with a cold in his\nhead to be sure, but with fresh glory and much plunder and two new fiefs\nto his credit: and at Storisende Dom Manuel found that his rooms had\nbeen thoroughly cleaned and set in such perfect order that he could lay\nhands upon none of his belongings, and that the pastry-cook had left.\n\n\"It simply shows you!\" says Dame Niafer, \"and all I have to say is that\nnow I hope you are satisfied.\"\n\nManuel laughed without merriment. \"Everything is in a conspiracy to\nsatisfy me in these sleek times, and it is that which chiefly plagues\nme.\"\n\nHe chucked Niafer under the chin, and told her she should be thinking of\nwhat a famous husband she had nowadays, instead of bothering about\npastry-cooks. Then he fell to asking little Melicent about how much she\nhad missed Father while Father was away, and he dutifully kissed the two\nother children, and he duly admired the additions to Emmerick's\nvocabulary during Father's absence. And afterward he went alone into the\nRoom of Ageus.\n\nThereafter he was used to spend more and more hours in the Room of\nAgeus, and the change in Count Manuel was more and more talked about.\nAnd the summer passed: and whether or no Count Manuel had, as some\ndeclared, contracted unholy alliances, there was no denying that all\nprospered with Count Manuel, and he was everywhere esteemed the most\nlucky and the least scrupulous rogue alive. But, very certainly, he was\nchanged.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVII\n\n\nOpinions of Hinzelmann\n\n\nNow the tale tells that on Michaelmas morning little Melicent, being in\na quiet mood that time, sat with her doll in the tall chair by the third\nwindow of Ageus while her father wrote at his big table. He was pausing\nbetween phrases to think and to bite at his thumb-nail, and he was so\nintent upon this letter to Pope Innocent that he did not notice the slow\nopening of the third window: and Melicent had been in conference with\nthe queer small boy for some while before Dom Manuel looked up\nabstractedly toward them. Then Manuel seemed perturbed, and he called\nMelicent to him, and she obediently scrambled into her father's lap.\n\nThere was silence in the Room of Ageus. The queer small boy sat leaning\nback in the chair which little Melicent had just left. He sat with his\nlegs crossed, and with his gloved hands clasping his right knee, as he\nlooked appraisingly at Melicent. He displayed a beautiful sad face, with\ncurled yellow hair hanging about his shoulders, and he was dressed in a\nvermilion silk coat: at his left side, worn like a sword, was a vast\npair of shears. He wore also a pointed hat of four interblended colors,\nand his leather gloves were figured with pearls.\n\n\"She will be a woman by and by,\" the strange boy said, with a soft and\ndelicate voice, \"and then she too will be coming to us, and we will\nprovide fine sorrows for her.\"\n\n\"No, Hinzelmann,\" Count Manuel replied, as he stroked the round\nstraw-colored head of little Melicent. \"This is the child of Niafer. She\ncomes of a race that has no time to be peering out of dubious windows.\"\n\n\"It is your child too, Count Manuel. Therefore she too, between now and\nher burial, will be wanting to be made free of my sister Suskind's\nkingdom, as you have been made free of it, at a price. Oh, very\ncertainly you have paid little as yet save the one lock of your gray\nhair, but in time you will pay the other price which Suskind demands. I\nknow, for it is I who collect my sister Suskind's revenues, and when the\nproper hour arrives, believe me, Count Manuel, I shall not be asking\nyour leave, nor is there any price which you, I think, will not be\npaying willingly.\"\n\n\"That is probable. For Suskind is wise and strange, and the grave beauty\nof her youth is the fulfilment of an old hope. Life had become a tedious\nmatter of much money and much bloodshed, but she has restored to me the\ngold and crimson of dawn.\"\n\n\"So, do you very greatly love my sister Suskind?\" says Hinzelmann,\nsmiling rather sadly.\n\n\"She is my heart's delight, and the desire of my desire. It was she for\nwhom, unwittingly, I had been longing always, since I first went away\nfrom Suskind, to climb upon the gray heights of Vraidex in my long\npursuit of much wealth and fame. I had seen my wishes fulfilled, and my\ndreams accomplished; all the godlike discontents which ennobled my youth\nhad died painlessly in cushioned places. And living had come to be a\nhabit of doing what little persons expected, and youth was gone out of\nme, and I, that used to follow with a high head after my own thinking\nand my own desires, could not any longer very greatly care for anything.\nNow I am changed: for Suskind has made me free once more of the Country\nof the Young and of the ageless self-tormenting youth of the gray depths\nwhich maddened Ruric, but did not madden me.\"\n\n\"Look you, Count Manuel, but that penniless young nobody, Ruric the\nclerk, was not trapped as you are trapped. For from the faith of others\nthere is no escape upon this side of the window. World-famous Manuel the\nRedeemer has in this place his luck and prosperity to maintain until the\norderings of unimaginative gods have quite destroyed the Manuel that\nonce followed after his own thinking. For even the high gods here note\nwith approval that you have become the sort of person in whom the gods\nput confidence, and so they favor you unscrupulously. Here all is\npre-arranged for you by the thinking of others. Here there is no escape\nfor you from acquiring a little more wealth to-day, a little more\nmeadowland to-morrow, with daily a little more applause and honor and\nenvy from your fellows, along with always slowly increasing wrinkles and\ndulling wits and an augmenting paunch, and with the smug approval of\neverybody upon earth and in heaven. That is the reward of those persons\nwhom you humorously call successful persons.\"\n\nDom Manuel answered very slowly, and to little Melicent it seemed that\nFather's voice was sad.\n\nSaid Manuel: \"Certainly, I think there is no escape for me upon this\nside of the window of Ageus. A bond was put upon me to make a figure in\nthis world, and I discharged that obligation. Then came another and yet\nanother obligation to be discharged. And now has come upon me a geas\nwhich is not to be lifted either by toils or by miracles. It is the geas\nwhich is laid on every person, and the life of every man is as my life,\nwith no moment free from some bond or another. Heh, youth vaunts\nwindily, but in the end nobody can follow after his own thinking and his\nown desire. At every turn he is confronted by that which is expected,\nand obligation follows obligation, and in the long run no champion can\nbe stronger than everybody. So we succumb to this world's terrible\nunreason, willy-nilly, and Helmas has been made wise, and Ferdinand has\nbeen made saintly, and I have been made successful, by that which was\nexpected of us, and by that which none of us had ever any real chance to\nresist in a world wherein all men are nourished by their beliefs.\"\n\n\"And does not success content you?\"\n\n\"Ah, but,\" asked Manuel slowly, just as he had once asked Horvendile in\nManuel's lost youth, \"what is success? They tell me I have succeeded\nmarvelously in all things, rising from low beginnings, to become the\nmost lucky and the least scrupulous rogue alive: yet, hearing men's\napplause, I sometimes wonder, for I know that a smaller-hearted creature\nand a creature poorer in spirit is posturing in Count Manuel's high\ncushioned places than used to go afield with the miller's pigs.\"\n\n\"Why, yes, Count Manuel, you have made endurable terms with this world\nby succumbing to its foolishness: but do you take comfort, for that is\nthe one way open to anybody who has not rightly seen and judged the ends\nof this world. At worst, you have had all your desires, and you have\nmade a very notable figure in Count Manuel's envied station.\"\n\n\"But I starve there, Hinzelmann, I dry away into stone, and this envied\nliving is reshaping me into a complacent idol for fools to honor, and\nthe approval of fools is converting the heart and wits of me into the\nstony heart and wits of an idol. And I look back upon my breathless old\nendeavors, and I wonder drearily, 'Was it for this?'\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Hinzelmann said: and he shrugged, without ever putting off that\nsad smile of his. \"Yes, yes, all this is only another way of saying that\nB\u00e9da has kept his word. But no man gets rid of Misery, Count Manuel,\nexcept at a price.\"\n\nThey stayed silent for a while. Count Manuel stroked the round\nstraw-colored head of little Melicent. Hinzelmann played with the small\ncross which hung at Hinzelmann's neck. This cross appeared to be woven\nof plaited strings, but when Hinzelmann shook the cross it jingled like\na bell.\n\n\"Yet, none the less,\" says Hinzelmann, \"here you remain. No, certainly,\nI cannot understand you, Count Manuel. As a drunkard goes back to the\ndestroying cask, so do you continue to return to your fine home at\nStorisende and to the incessant whispering of your father's father, for\nall that you have but to remain in Suskind's low red-pillared palace to\nbe forever rid of that whisper and of this dreary satiating of human\ndesires.\"\n\n\"I shall of course make my permanent quarters there by and by,\" Count\nManuel said, \"but not just yet. It would not be quite fair to my wife\nfor me to be leaving Storisende just now, when we are getting in the\ncrops, and when everything is more or less upset already--\"\n\n\"I perceive you are still inventing excuses, Count Manuel, to put off\nyielding entire allegiance to my sister.\"\n\n\"No, it is not that, not that at all! It is only the upset condition of\nthings, just now, and, besides, Hinzelmann, the stork is to bring us the\nlast girl child the latter part of next week. We are to call her\nEttarre, and I would like to have a sight of her, of course--In fact, I\nam compelled to stay through mere civility, inasmuch as the Queen of\nPhilistia is sending the very famous St. Holmendis especially to\nchristen this baby. And it would be, Hinzelmann, the height of rudeness\nfor me to be leaving home, just now, as though I wanted to avoid his\nvisit--\"\n\nHinzelmann still smiled rather sadly. \"Last month you could not come to\nus because your wife was just then outworn with standing in the hot\nkitchen and stewing jams and marmalades. Dom Manuel, will you come when\nthe baby is delivered and this Saint has been attended to and all the\ncrops are in?\"\n\n\"Well, but Hinzelmann, within a week or two we shall be brewing this\nyear's ale, and I have always more or less seen to that--\"\n\nStill Hinzelmann smiled sadly. He pointed with his small gloved hand\ntoward Melicent. \"And what about your other enslavement, to this child\nhere?\"\n\n\"Why, certainly, Hinzelmann, the brat does need a father to look out for\nher, so long as she is the merest baby. And naturally, I have been\nthinking about that of late, rather seriously--\"\n\nHinzelmann spoke with deliberation. \"She is very nearly the most stupid\nand the most unattractive child I have ever seen. And I, you must\nremember, am blood brother to Cain and Seth as well as to Suskind.\"\n\nBut Dom Manuel was not provoked. \"As if I did not know the child is in\nno way remarkable! No, my good Hinzelmann, you that serve Suskind have\nshown me strange dear things, but nothing more strange and dear than a\nthing which I discovered for myself. For I am that Manuel whom men call\nthe Redeemer of Poictesme, and my deeds will be the themes of harpers\nwhose grandparents are not yet born; I have known love and war and all\nmanner of adventure: but all the sighings and hushed laughter of\nyesterday, and all the trumpet-blowing and shouting, and all that I have\nwitnessed of the unreticent fond human ways of great persons who for the\nwhile have put aside their state, and all the good that in my day I may\nhave done, and all the evil that I have certainly destroyed,--all this\nseems trivial as set against the producing of this tousled brat. No, to\nbe sure, she is backward as compared with Emmerick, or even Dorothy, and\nshe is not, as you say, an at all remarkable child, though very often, I\ncan assure you, she does things that would astonish you. Now, for\ninstance--\"\n\n\"Spare me!\" said Hinzelmann.\n\n\"Well, but it really was very clever of her,\" Dom Manuel stipulated,\nwith disappointment. \"However, I was going to say that I, who have\nharried pagandom, and capped jests with kings, and am now setting terms\nfor the Holy Father, have come to regard the doings of this ill-bred,\nselfish, ugly, little imp as more important than my doings. And I cannot\nresolve to leave her, just yet. So, Hinzelmann, my friend, I think I\nwill not thoroughly commit myself, just yet. But after Christmas we will\nsee about it.\"\n\n\"And I will tell you the two reasons of this shilly-shallying, Count\nManuel. One reason is that you are human, and the other reason is that\nin your head there are gray hairs.\"\n\n\"What, can it be,\" said the big warrior, forlornly, \"that I who have not\nyet had twenty-six years of living am past my prime, and that already\nlife is going out of me?\"\n\n\"You must remember the price you paid to win back Dame Niafer from\nparadise. As truth, and not the almanac, must estimate these things you\nare now nearer fifty-six.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Manuel said, stoutly, \"I do not regret it, and for Niafer's sake\nI am willing to become a hundred and six. But certainly it is hard to\nthink of myself as an old fellow on the brink of the scrap-pile.\"\n\n\"Oho, you are not yet so old, Count Manuel, but that Suskind's power is\ngreater than the power of the child: and besides, there is a way to\nbreak the power of the child. Death has merely scratched small wrinkles,\nvery lightly, with one talon, to mark you as his by and by. That is all\nas yet: and so the power of my high sister Suskind endures over you, who\nwere once used to follow after your own thinking and your own desire,\nfor there remains in you a leaven even to-day. Yes, yes, though you deny\nher to-day, you will be entreating her to-morrow, and then it may be she\nwill punish you. Either way, I must be going now, since you are\nobstinate, for it is at this time I run about the September world\ncollecting my sister's revenues, and her debtors are very numerous.\"\n\nAnd with that the boy, still smiling gravely, slipped out of the third\nwindow into the gray sweet-smelling dusk, and little Melicent said,\n\"But, Father, why did that queer sad boy want me to be climbing out of\nthe window with him?\"\n\n\"So that he might be kind to you, my dear, as he estimates kindness.\"\n\n\"But why did the sad boy want a piece of my hair?\" asked Melicent; \"and\nwhy did he cut it off with his big shiny shears, while you were writing,\nand he was playing with me?\"\n\n\"It was to pay a price,\" says Manuel.\n\nHe knew now that the Alf charm was laid on his loved child, and that\nthis was the price of his junketings. He knew also that Suskind would\nnever remit this price.\n\nThen Melicent demanded, \"And what makes your face so white?\"\n\n\"It must be pale with hunger, child: so I think that you and I had\nbetter be getting to our dinner.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nXXXVIII\n\n\nFarewell to Suskind\n\n\nBut after dinner Dom Manuel came alone into the Room of Ageus, and\nequipped himself as the need was, and he climbed out of the charmed\nwindow for the last time. His final visit to the depths was horrible,\nthey say, and they relate that of all the deeds of Dom Manuel's crowded\nlifetime the thing that he did on this day was the most grim. But he won\nthrough all, by virtue of his equipment and his fixed heart. So when Dom\nManuel returned he clasped in his left hand a lock of fine straw-colored\nhair, and on both his hands was blood let from no human veins.\n\nHe looked back for the last time into the gray depths. A crowned girl\nrose beside him noiselessly, all white and red, and she clasped her\nbloodied lovely arms about him, and she drew him to her hacked young\nbreasts, and she kissed him for the last time. Then her arms were loosed\nfrom about Dom Manuel, and she fell away from him, and was swallowed by\nthe gray sweet-scented depths.\n\n\"And so farewell to you, Queen Suskind,\" says Count Manuel. \"You who\nwere not human, but knew only the truth of things, could never\nunderstand our foolish human notions. Otherwise you would never have\ndemanded the one price I may not pay.\"\n\n\"Weep, weep for Suskind!\" then said Lubrican, wailing feebly in the gray\nand April-scented dusk; \"for it was she alone who knew the secret of\npreserving that dissatisfaction which is divine where all else falls\naway with age into the acquiescence of beasts.\"\n\n\"Why, yes, but unhappiness is not the true desire of man,\" says Manuel.\n\"I know, for I have had both happiness and unhappiness, and neither\ncontented me.\"\n\n\"Weep, weep for Suskind!\" then cried the soft and delicate voice of\nHinzelmann: \"for it was she that would have loved you, Manuel, with that\nlove of which youth dreams, and which exists nowhere upon your side of\nthe window, where all kissed women turn to stupid figures of warm earth,\nand all love falls away with age into the acquiescence of beasts.\"\n\n\"Oh, it is very true,\" says Manuel, \"that all my life henceforward will\nbe a wearying business because of long desires for Suskind's love and\nSuskind's lips and the grave beauty of her youth, and for all the\nhigh-hearted dissatisfactions of youth. But the Alf charm is lifted from\nthe head of my child, and Melicent will live as Niafer lives, and it\nwill be better for all of us, and I am content.\"\n\nFrom below came many voices wailing confusedly. \"We weep for Suskind.\nSuskind is slain with the one weapon that might slay her: and all we\nweep for Suskind, who was the fairest and the wisest and the most\nunreasonable of queens. Let all the Hidden Children weep for Suskind,\nwhose heart and life was April, and who plotted courageously against the\norderings of unimaginative gods, and who has been butchered to preserve\nthe hair of a quite ordinary child.\"\n\nThen said the Count of Poictesme: \"And that young Manuel who was in his\nday a wilful champion, and who fretted under ordered wrongs, and who\nwent everywhither with a high head a-boasting that he followed after his\nown thinking and his own desire,--why, that young fellow also is now\nsilenced and dead. For the well-thought-of Count of Poictesme must be as\nthe will and the faith and as the need of others may dictate: and there\nis no help for it, and no escape, and our old appearances must be\npreserved upon this side of the window in order that we may all stay\nsane.\"\n\n\"We weep, and with long weeping raise the dirge for Suskind--!\"\n\n\"But I, who do not weep,--I raise the dirge for Manuel. For I must\nhenceforward be reasonable in all things, and I shall never be quite\ndiscontented any more: and I must feed and sleep as the beasts do, and\nit may be that I shall even fall to thinking complacently about my death\nand glorious resurrection. Yes, yes, all this is certain, and I may not\never go a-traveling everywhither to see the ends of this world and judge\nthem: and the desire to do so no longer moves in me, for there is a\ncloud about my goings, and there is a whispering which follows me, and I\ntoo fall away into the acquiescence of beasts. Meanwhile no hair of the\nchild's head has been injured, and I am content.\"\n\n\"Let all the Hidden Children, and all else that lives except the tall\ngray son of Oriander, whose blood is harsh sea-water, weep for Suskind!\nSuskind is dead, that was unstained by human sin and unredeemed by\nChrist's dear blood, and youth has perished from the world. Oh, let us\nweep, for all the world grows chill and gray as Oriander's son.\"\n\n\"And Oriander too is dead, as I well know that slew him in my hour. Now\nmy hour passes; and I pass with it, to make way for the needs of my\nchildren, as he perforce made way for me. And in time these children,\nand their children after them, pass thus, and always age must be in one\nmode or another slain by youth. Now why this should be so, I cannot\nguess, nor do I see that much good comes of it, nor do I find that in\nmyself which warrants any confidences from the most high controlling\ngods. But I am certain that no hair of the child's head has been\ninjured; and I am certain that I am content.\"\n\nThus speaking, the old fellow closed the window.\n\nAnd within the moment little Melicent came to molest him, and she was\nunusually dirty and disheveled, for she had been rolling on the terrace\npavement, and had broken half the fastenings from her clothing: and Dom\nManuel wiped her nose rather forlornly. Of a sudden he laughed and\nkissed her. And Count Manuel said he must send for masons to wall up the\nthird window of Ageus, so that it might not ever be opened any more in\nCount Manuel's day for him to breathe through it the dim sweet-scented\nair of spring.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nXXXIX\n\n\nThe Passing of Manuel\n\n\nThen as Dom Manuel turned from the window of Ageus, it seemed that young\nHorvendile had opened the door yonder, and after an instant's pensive\nstaring at Dom Manuel, had gone away. This happened, if it happened at\nall, so furtively and quickly that Count Manuel could not be sure of it:\nbut he could entertain no doubt as to the other person who was\nconfronting him. There was not any telling how this lean stranger had\ncome into the private apartments of the Count of Poictesme, nor was\nthere any need for Manuel to wonder over the management of this\nintrusion, for the new arrival was not, after all, an entire stranger to\nDom Manuel.\n\nSo Manuel said nothing, as he stood there stroking the round\nstraw-colored head of little Melicent. The stranger waited, equally\nsilent. There was no noise at all in the room until afar off a dog began\nto howl.\n\n\"Yes, certainly,\" Dom Manuel said, \"I might have known that my life was\nbound up with the life of Suskind, since my desire of her is the one\ndesire which I have put aside unsatisfied. O rider of the white horse,\nyou are very welcome.\"\n\nThe other replied: \"Why should you think that I know anything about this\nSuskind or that we of the L\u00e9shy keep any account of your doings? No\nmatter what you may elect to think, however, it was decreed that the\nfirst person I found here should ride hence on my black horse. But you\nand the child stand abreast. So you must choose again, Dom Manuel,\nwhether it be you or another who rides on my black horse.\"\n\nThen Manuel bent down, and he kissed little Melicent. \"Go to your\nmother, dear, and tell her--\" He paused here. He queerly moved his\nmouth, as though it were stiff and he were trying to make it more\nsupple.\n\nSays Melicent, \"But what am I to tell her, Father?\"\n\n\"Oh, a very funny thing, my darling. You are to tell Mother that Father\nhas always loved her over and above all else, and that she is always to\nremember that and--why, that in consequence she is to give you some\nginger cakes,\" says Manuel, smiling.\n\nSo the child ran happily away, without once looking back, and Manuel\nclosed the door behind her, and he was now quite alone with his lean\nvisitor.\n\n\"Come,\" says the stranger, \"so you have plucked up some heart after all!\nYet it is of no avail to posture with me, who know you to be spurred to\nthis by vanity rather than by devotion. Oh, very probably you are as\nfond of the child as is requisite, and of your other children too, but\nyou must admit that after you have played with any one of them for a\nquarter of an hour you become most heartily tired of the small squirming\npest.\"\n\nManuel intently regarded him, and squinting Manuel smiled sleepily. \"No;\nI love all my children with the customary paternal infatuation.\"\n\n\"Also you must have your gesture by sending at the last a lying message\nto your wife, to comfort the poor soul against to-morrow and the day\nafter. You are--magnanimously, you like to think,--according her this\nparting falsehood, half in contemptuous kindness and half in relief,\nbecause at last you are now getting rid of a complacent and\nmuddle-headed fool of whom, also, you are most heartily tired.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" says Manuel, still smiling; \"to my partial eyes dear Niafer\nremains the most clever and beautiful of women, and my delight in her\nhas not ever wavered. But wherever do you get these curious notions?\"\n\n\"Ah, I have been with so many husbands at the last, Count Manuel.\"\n\nAnd Manuel shrugged. \"What fearful indiscretions you suggest! No,\nfriend, that sort of thing has an ill sound, and they should have\nremembered that even at the last there is the bond of silence.\"\n\n\"Come, come, Count Manuel, you are a queer cool fellow, and you have\nworn these masks and attitudes with tolerable success, as your world\ngoes. But you are now bound for a diversely ordered world, a world in\nwhich your handsome wrappings are not to the purpose.\"\n\n\"Well, I do not know how that may be,\" replies Count Manuel, \"but at all\nevents there is a decency in these things and an indecency, and I shall\nnever of my own free will expose the naked soul of Manuel to anybody.\nNo, it would be no pleasant spectacle, I think: certainly, I have never\nlooked at it, nor did I mean to. Perhaps, as you assert, some power\nwhich is stronger than I may some day tear all masks aside: but this\nwill not be my fault, and I shall even then reserve the right to\nconsider that stripping as a rather vulgar bit of tyranny. Meanwhile I\nmust, of necessity, adhere to my own sense of decorum, and not to that\nof anybody else, not even to the wide experience of one\"--Count Manuel\nbowed,--\"who is, in a manner of speaking, my guest.\"\n\n\"Oh, as always, you posture very tolerably, and men in general will\nacclaim you as successful in your life. But do you look back! For the\nhour has come, Count Manuel, for you to confess, as all persons confess\nat my arrival, that you have faltered between one desire and another,\nnot ever knowing truly what you desired, and not ever being content with\nany desire when it was accomplished.\"\n\n\"Softly, friend! For I am forced to gather from your wild way of talking\nthat you of the L\u00e9shy indeed do not keep any record of our human\ndoings.\"\n\nThe stranger raised what he had of eyebrows. \"But how can we,\" he\ninquired, \"when we have so many matters of real importance to look\nafter?\"\n\nCandid blunt Dom Manuel answered without any anger, speaking even\njovially, but in all maintaining the dignity of a high prince assured of\nhis own worth.\n\n\"That excuses, then, your nonsensical remarks. I must make bold to\ninform you that everybody tells me I have very positive achievements to\nlook back upon. I do not care to boast, you understand, and to be forced\ninto self-praise is abhorrent to me. Yet truthfulness is all important\nat this solemn hour, and anyone hereabouts can tell you it was I who\nclimbed gray Vraidex, and dealt so hardily with the serpents and other\nhorrific protectors of Miramon Lluagor that I destroyed most of them and\nput the others to flight. Thereafter men narrate how I made my own terms\nwith the terrified magician, according him his forfeited life in\nexchange for a promise to live henceforward more respectfully and to\nserve under me in the war which I was already planning against the\nNorthmen. Yes, and men praise me, too, because I managed to accomplish\nall these things while I was hampered by having to look out for and\nprotect a woman.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said the lean stranger, \"I know you somehow got the better of\nthat romantic visionary half-brother of mine, and made a warrior out of\nhim: and I admit this was rather remarkable. But what does it matter\nnow?\"\n\n\"Then they will tell you it was I that wisely reasoned with King Helmas\nuntil I turned him from folly, and I that with holy arguments converted\nKing Ferdinand from his wickedness. I restored the magic to the robe of\nthe Apsarasas when but for me its magic would have been lost\nirrevocably. I conquered Freydis, that woman of strange deeds, and\nsingle-handed I fought against her spoorns and calcars and other terrors\nof antiquity, slaying, to be accurate, seven hundred and eighty-two of\nthem. I also conquered the Misery of earth, whom some called B\u00e9da, and\nothers Kruchina, and yet others Mimir, after a very notable battle which\nwe fought with enchanted swords for a whole month without ever pausing\nfor rest. I went intrepidly into the paradise of the heathen, and routed\nall its terrific warders, and so fetched hence the woman whom I desired.\nThus, friend, did I repurchase that heroic and unchanging love which\nexists between my wife and me.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the stranger, \"Why, that too is very remarkable. But what\ndoes it matter now?\"\n\n\"--For it is of common report among men that nothing has ever been able\nto withstand Dom Manuel. Thus it was natural enough, men say, that, when\nthe lewd and evil god whom nowadays so many adore as Sesphra of the\nDreams was for establishing his power by making an alliance with me, I\nshould have driven him howling and terrified into the heart of a great\nfire. For myself, I say nothing; but when the very gods run away from a\nchampion there is some adequate reason: and of this exploit, and of all\nthese exploits, and of many other exploits, equally incredible and\nequally well vouched for, all person hereabouts will tell you. As to the\nprodigies of valor which I performed in redeeming Poictesme from the\noppression of the Northmen, you will find documentary evidence in those\nthree epic poems, just to your left there, which commemorate my feats in\nthis campaign--\"\n\n\"Nobody disputes this campaign also may have been remarkable, and\ncertainly I do not dispute it: for I cannot see that these doings matter\na button's worth in my business with you, and, besides, I never argue.\"\n\n\"And no more do I! because I abhor vainglory, and I know these affairs\nare now a part of established history. No, friend, you cannot destroy my\ncredit in this world, whereas in the world for which I am bound, you\ntell me, they make no account of our doings. So, whether or not I did\nthese things, I shall always retain, in this world and in the next, the\ncredit for them, without any need to resort to distasteful boasting. And\nthat, as I was going on to explain, is precisely why I do not find it\nnecessary to tell you about these matters, or even to allude to them.\"\n\n\"Oh, doubtless, it is something to have excelled all your fellows in so\nmany ways,\" the stranger conceded, with a sort of grudging respect:\n\"but, I repeat, what does it matter now?\"\n\n\"And, if you will pardon my habitual frankness, friend, that query with\nso constant repetition becomes a trifle monotonous. No, it does not\ndishearten me, I am past that. No, I once opened a window, the more\nclearly to appraise the most dear rewards of my endeavors--That moment\nwas my life, that single quiet moment summed up all my living,\nand\"--here Manuel smiled gravely,--\"still without boasting, friend, I\nmust tell you that in this moment all doubt as to my attested worth went\nout of me, who had redeemed a kingdom, and begotten a king, and created\na god. So you waste time, my friend, in trying to convince me of all\nhuman life's failure and unimportance, for I am not in sympathy with\nthis modern morbid pessimistic way of talking. It has a very ill sound,\nand nothing whatever is to be gained by it.\"\n\nThe other answered shrewdly: \"Yes, you speak well, and you posture\nhandsomely, in every respect save one. For you call me 'friend.' Hah,\nManuel, from behind the squinting mask a sick and satiated and\ndisappointed being spoke there, howsoever resolutely you keep up\nappearances.\"\n\n\"There spoke mere courtesy, Grandfather Death,\" says Manuel, now openly\nlaughing, \"and for the rest, if you again will pardon frankness, it is\nless with the contents of my heart than with its continued motion that\nyou have any proper concern.\"\n\n\"Truly it is no affair of mine, Count Manuel, nor do any of your doings\nmatter to me. Therefore let us be going now, unless--O most unusual man,\nwho at the last assert your life to have been a successful and important\nbusiness,--unless you now desire some time wherein to bid farewell to\nyour loved wife and worshipped children and to all your other fine\nworks.\"\n\nDom Manuel shrugged broad shoulders. \"And to what end? No, I am Manuel.\nI have lived in the loneliness which is common to all men, but the\ndifference is that I have known it. Now it is necessary for me, as it is\nnecessary for all men, to die in this same loneliness, and I know that\nthere is no help for it.\"\n\n\"Once, Manuel, you feared to travel with me, and you bid Niafer mount in\nyour stead on my black horse, saying, 'Better she than I.'\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, what curious things we do when we are boys! Well, I am wiser\nnow, for since then I have achieved all that I desired, save only to see\nthe ends of this world and to judge them, and I would have achieved that\ntoo, perhaps, if only I had desired it a little more heartily. Yes, yes,\nI tell you frankly, I have grown so used to getting my desire that I\nbelieve, even now, if I desired you to go hence alone you also would\nobey me.\"\n\nGrandfather Death smiled thinly. \"I reserve my own opinion. But take it\nwhat you say is true,--and do you desire me to go hence alone?\"\n\n\"No,\" says Manuel, very quietly.\n\nThereupon Dom Manuel passed to the western window, and he stood there,\nlooking out over broad rolling uplands. He viewed a noble country, good\nto live in, rich with grain and metal, embowered with tall forests, and\nwatered by pleasant streams. Walled cities it had, and castles crowned\nits eminences. Very far beneath Dom Manuel the leaded roofs of his\nfortresses glittered in the sunset, for Storisende guarded the loftiest\npart of all inhabited Poictesme. He overlooked, directly, the turrets or\nRanec and of Asch; to the south was N\u00e9rac; northward showed Perdigon:\nand the prince of no country owned any finer castles than were these\nfour, in which lived Manuel's servants.\n\n\"It is strange,\" says Dom Manuel, \"to think that everything I am seeing\nwas mine a moment since, and it is queer too to think of what a famous\nfellow was this Manuel the Redeemer, and of the fine things he did, and\nit is appalling to wonder if all the other applauded heroes of mankind\nare like him. Oh, certainly, Count Manuel's achievements were notable\nand such as were not known anywhere before, and men will talk of them\nfor a long while. Yet, looking back,--now that this famed Count of\nPoictesme means less to me,--why, I seem to see only the strivings of an\nape reft of his tail, and grown rusty at climbing, who has reeled\nblunderingly from mystery to mystery, with pathetic makeshifts, not\nunderstanding anything, greedy in all desires, and always honeycombed\nwith poltroonery. So in a secret place his youth was put away in\nexchange for a prize that was hardly worth the having; and the fine geas\nwhich his mother laid upon him was exchanged for the common geas of what\nseems expected.\"\n\n\"Such notions,\" replied Grandfather Death, \"are entertained by many of\nyou humans in the light-headed time of youth. Then common-sense arises\nlike a light formless cloud about your goings, and you half forget these\nnotions. Then I bring darkness.\"\n\n\"In that quiet dark, my friend, it may be I shall again become the\nManuel whom I remember, and I may get back again my own undemonstrable\nideas, in place of the ideas of other persons, to entertain me in that\ndarkness. So let us be going thither.\"\n\n\"Very willingly,\" said Grandfather Death; and he started toward the\ndoor.\n\n\"Now, pardon me,\" says Manuel, \"but in Poictesme the Count of Poictesme\ngoes first in any company. It may seem to you an affair of no\nimportance, but nowadays I concede the strength as well as the\nfoolishness of my accustomed habits, and all my life long I have gone\nfirst. So do you ride a little way behind me, friend, and carry this\nshroud and napkin, till I have need of them.\"\n\nThen the Count armed and departed from Storisende, riding on the black\nhorse, in jeweled armor, and carrying before him his black shield upon\nwhich was emblazoned the silver stallion of Poictesme and the motto\n_Mundus vult decipi._ Behind him was Grandfather Death on the white\nhorse, carrying the Count's grave-clothes in a neat bundle. They rode\ntoward the sunset, and against the yellow sunset each figure showed jet\nblack.\n\nAnd thereafter Count Manuel was seen no more in Poictesme, nor did\nanyone ever know certainly whither he journeyed. There was a lad called\nJurgen, the son of Coth of the Rocks, who came to Storisende in a frenzy\nof terror, very early the next morning, with a horrific tale of\nincredible events witnessed upon Upper Morven: but the child's tale was\nnot heeded, because everybody knew that Count Manuel was unconquerable,\nand--having everything which men desire,--would never be leaving all\nthese amenities of his own will, and certainly would never be taking\npart in any such dubious doings. Therefore little Jurgen was spanked,\nalike for staying out all night and for his wild lying: and they of\nPoictesme awaited the return of their great Dom Manuel; and not for a\nlong while did they suspect that Manuel had departed homeward, after\nhaving succeeded in everything. Nor for a long while was the whole of\nlittle Jurgen's story made public.\n\n\n\n\nXL\n\n\nColophon: Da Capo\n\n\nNow Some of Poictesme--but not all they of Poictesme, because the pious\ndeny this portion of the tale, and speak of an ascension,--some narrate\nthat after the appalling eucharist which young Jurgen witnessed upon\nUpper Morven, the Redeemer of Poictesme rode on a far and troubling\njourney with Grandfather Death, until the two had passed the sunset, and\nhad come to the dark stream of Lethe.\n\n\"Now we must ford these shadowy waters,\" said Grandfather Death, \"in\npart because your destiny is on the other side, and in part because by\nthe contact of these waters all your memories will be washed away from\nyou. And that is requisite to your destiny.\"\n\n\"But what is my destiny?\"\n\n\"It is that of all loving creatures, Count Manuel. If you have been\nyourself you cannot reasonably be punished, but if you have been\nsomebody else you will find that this is not permitted.\"\n\n\"That is a dark saying, only too well suited to this doubtful place, and\nI do not understand you.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Grandfather Death, \"but that does not matter.\"\n\nThen the black horse and the white horse entered the water: and they\npassed over, and the swine of Eubouleus were waiting for them, but these\nwere not yet untethered.\n\nSo in the moment which remained Dom Manuel looked backward and downward,\nand he saw that Grandfather Death had spoken truly. For all the memories\nof Manuel's life had been washed away from him, so that these memories\nwere left adrift and submerged in the shadowy waters of Lethe. Drowned\nthere was the wise countenance of Helmas, and the face of St. Ferdinand\nwith a tarnished halo about it, and the puzzled features of Horvendile;\nand glowing birds and glistening images and the shimmering designs of\nMiramon thronged there confusedly, and among them went with moving jaws\na head of sleek white clay. The golden loveliness of Alianora, and the\ndark splendor of Freydis and, derisively, the immortal young smile of\nSesphra, showed each for a moment, and was gone. Then Niafer's eyes\ndisplayed their mildly wondering disapproval for the last time, and the\nsmall faces of children that in the end were hers and not Manuel's\npassed with her: and the shine of armor, and a tossing heave of jaunty\nbanners, and gleaming castle turrets, and all the brilliancies and\ncolors that Manuel had known and loved anywhere, save only the clear red\nand white of Suskind's face, seemed to be passing incoherently through\nthe still waters, like bright broken wreckage which an undercurrent was\nsweeping away.\n\nAnd Manuel sighed, almost as if in relief. \"So this,\" he said, \"this is\nthe preposterous end of him who was everywhere esteemed the most lucky\nand the least scrupulous rogue of his day!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" replied Grandfather Death, as slowly he untethered one by\none the swine of Eubouleus. \"Yes, it is indeed the end, since all your\nlife is passing away there, to be beheld by your old eyes alone, for the\nlast time. Thus I see nothing there but ordinary water, and I wonder\nwhat it is you find in that dark pool to keep you staring so.\"\n\n\"I do not very certainly know,\" said Manuel, \"but, a little more and\nmore mistily now, I seem to see drowned there all the loves and the\ndesires and the adventures I had when I wore another body than this\ndilapidated gray body I now wear. And yet it is a deceiving water, for\nthere, where it should reflect the remnants of the old fellow that is I,\nit shows, instead, the face of a young boy who is used to following\nafter his own thinking and his own desires.\"\n\n\"Certainly it is queer you should be saying that; for that, as everybody\nknows, was the favorite by-word of your namesake the famous Count Manuel\nwho is so newly dead in Poictesme yonder.... But what is that thing?\"\n\nManuel raised from looking at the water just the handsome and florid\nyoung face which Manuel had seen reflected in the water. As his memories\nvanished, the tall boy incuriously wondered who might be the snub-nosed\nstranger that was waiting there with the miller's pigs, and was\npointing, as if in mild surprise, toward the two stones overgrown with\nmoss and supporting a cross of old worm-eaten wood. For the stranger\npointed at the unfinished, unsatisfying image which stood beside the\npool of Haranton, wherein, they say, strange dreams engender....\n\n\"What is that thing?\" the stranger was asking, yet again....\n\n\"It is the figure of a man,\" said Manuel, \"which I have modeled and\nremodeled, and cannot get exactly to my liking. So it is necessary that\nI keep laboring at it, until the figure is to my thinking and my\ndesire.\" Thus it was in the old days.\n\n\nEXPLICIT\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FIGURES OF EARTH***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 11639-8.txt or 11639-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/1/1/6/3/11639\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\nhttp://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06\n\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n"}
