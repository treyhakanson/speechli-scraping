II\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS:\n\n\n\n\nBOOK X\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. How Sir Tristram jousted, and smote down King Arthur, because\nhe told him not the cause why he bare that shield.\n\n\nAND if so be ye can descrive what ye bear, ye are worthy to bear the\narms. As for that, said Sir Tristram, I will answer you; this shield was\ngiven me, not desired, of Queen Morgan le Fay; and as for me, I can not\ndescrive these arms, for it is no point of my charge, and yet I trust to\nGod to bear them with worship. Truly, said King Arthur, ye ought not to\nbear none arms but if ye wist what ye bear: but I pray you tell me your\nname. To what intent? said Sir Tristram. For I would wit, said Arthur.\nSir, ye shall not wit as at this time. Then shall ye and I do battle\ntogether, said King Arthur. Why, said Sir Tristram, will ye do battle\nwith me but if I tell you my name? and that little needeth you an ye\nwere a man of worship, for ye have seen me this day have had great\ntravail, and therefore ye are a villainous knight to ask battle of me,\nconsidering my great travail; howbeit I will not fail you, and have ye\nno doubt that I fear not you; though you think you have me at a great\nadvantage yet shall I right well endure you. And there withal King\nArthur dressed his shield and his spear, and Sir Tristram against him,\nand they came so eagerly together. And there King Arthur brake his spear\nall to pieces upon Sir Tristram's shield. But Sir Tristram hit Arthur\nagain, that horse and man fell to the earth. And there was King Arthur\nwounded on the left side, a great wound and a perilous.\n\nThen when Sir Uwaine saw his lord Arthur lie on the ground sore wounded,\nhe was passing heavy. And then he dressed his shield and his spear, and\ncried aloud unto Sir Tristram and said: Knight, defend thee. So they\ncame together as thunder, and Sir Uwaine brised his spear all to pieces\nupon Sir Tristram's shield, and Sir Tristram smote him harder and sorer,\nwith such a might that he bare him clean out of his saddle to the earth.\nWith that Sir Tristram turned about and said: Fair knights, I had no\nneed to joust with you, for I have had enough to do this day. Then arose\nArthur and went to Sir Uwaine, and said to Sir Tristram: We have as we\nhave deserved, for through our orgulyt\u00e9 we demanded battle of you,\nand yet we knew not your name. Nevertheless, by Saint Cross, said Sir\nUwaine, he is a strong knight at mine advice as any is now living.\n\nThen Sir Tristram departed, and in every place he asked and demanded\nafter Sir Launcelot, but in no place he could not hear of him whether he\nwere dead or alive; wherefore Sir Tristram made great dole and sorrow.\nSo Sir Tristram rode by a forest, and then was he ware of a fair tower\nby a marsh on that one side, and on that other side a fair meadow. And\nthere he saw ten knights fighting together. And ever the nearer he came\nhe saw how there was but one knight did battle against nine knights,\nand that one did so marvellously that Sir Tristram had great wonder\nthat ever one knight might do so great deeds of arms. And then within a\nlittle while he had slain half their horses and unhorsed them, and their\nhorses ran in the fields and forest. Then Sir Tristram had so great pity\nof that one knight that endured so great pain, and ever he thought it\nshould be Sir Palomides, by his shield. And so he rode unto the knights\nand cried unto them, and bade them cease of their battle, for they did\nthemselves great shame so many knights to fight with one. Then answered\nthe master of those knights, his name was called Breuse Saunce Pit\u00e9,\nthat was at that time the most mischievoust knight living, and said\nthus: Sir knight, what have ye ado with us to meddle? and therefore,\nan ye be wise, depart on your way as ye came, for this knight shall not\nescape us. That were pity, said Sir Tristram, that so good a knight\nas he is should be slain so cowardly; and therefore I warn you I will\nsuccour him with all my puissance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. How Sir Tristram saved Sir Palomides' life, and how they\npromised to fight together within a fortnight.\n\n\nSo Sir Tristram alighted off his horse because they were on foot, that\nthey should not slay his horse, and then dressed his shield, with his\nsword in his hand, and he smote on the right hand and on the left hand\npassing sore, that well-nigh at every stroke he struck down a knight.\nAnd when they espied his strokes they fled all with Breuse Saunce Pit\u00e9\nunto the tower, and Sir Tristram followed fast after with his sword in\nhis hand, but they escaped into the tower, and shut Sir Tristram without\nthe gate. And when Sir Tristram saw this he returned aback unto Sir\nPalomides, and found him sitting under a tree sore wounded. Ah,\nfair knight, said Sir Tristram, well be ye found. Gramercy, said Sir\nPalomides, of your great goodness, for ye have rescued me of my life,\nand saved me from my death. What is your name? said Sir Tristram. He\nsaid: My name is Sir Palomides. O Jesu, said Sir Tristram, thou hast a\nfair grace of me this day that I should rescue thee, and thou art the\nman in the world that I most hate; but now make thee ready, for I will\ndo battle with thee. What is your name? said Sir Palomides. My name is\nSir Tristram, your mortal enemy. It may be so, said Sir Palomides; but\nye have done over much for me this day that I should fight with you; for\ninasmuch as ye have saved my life it will be no worship for you to have\nado with me, for ye are fresh and I am wounded sore, and therefore, an\nye will needs have ado with me, assign me a day and then I shall meet\nwith you without fail. Ye say well, said Sir Tristram, now I assign you\nto meet me in the meadow by the river of Camelot, where Merlin set the\nperon. So they were agreed.\n\nThen Sir Tristram asked Sir Palomides why the ten knights did battle\nwith him. For this cause, said Sir Palomides; as I rode upon mine\nadventures in a forest here beside I espied where lay a dead knight, and\na lady weeping beside him. And when I saw her making such dole, I asked\nher who slew her lord. Sir, she said, the falsest knight of the world\nnow living, and he is the most villain that ever man heard speak of and\nhis name is Sir Breuse Saunce Pit\u00e9. Then for pity I made the damosel to\nleap on her palfrey, and I promised her to be her warrant, and to help\nher to inter her lord. And so, suddenly, as I came riding by this tower,\nthere came out Sir Breuse Saunce Pit\u00e9, and suddenly he struck me from\nmy horse. And then or I might recover my horse this Sir Breuse slew the\ndamosel. And so I took my horse again, and I was sore ashamed, and so\nbegan the medley betwixt us: and this is the cause wherefore we did this\nbattle. Well, said Sir Tristram, now I understand the manner of your\nbattle, but in any wise have remembrance of your promise that ye have\nmade with me to do battle with me this day fortnight. I shall not fail\nyou, said Sir Palomides. Well, said Sir Tristram, as at this time I will\nnot fail you till that ye be out of the danger of your enemies.\n\nSo they mounted upon their horses, and rode together unto that forest,\nand there they found a fair well, with clear water bubbling. Fair sir,\nsaid Sir Tristram, to drink of that water have I courage; and then they\nalighted off their horses. And then were they ware by them where stood a\ngreat horse tied to a tree, and ever he neighed. And then were they ware\nof a fair knight armed, under a tree, lacking no piece of harness, save\nhis helm lay under his head. By the good lord, said Sir Tristram, yonder\nlieth a well-faring knight; what is best to do? Awake him, said Sir\nPalomides. So Sir Tristram awaked him with the butt of his spear. And\nso the knight rose up hastily and put his helm upon his head, and gat a\ngreat spear in his hand; and without any more words he hurled unto Sir\nTristram, and smote him clean from his saddle to the earth, and hurt him\non the left side, that Sir Tristram lay in great peril. Then he walloped\nfarther, and fetched his course, and came hurling upon Sir Palomides,\nand there he struck him a part through the body, that he fell from his\nhorse to the earth. And then this strange knight left them there,\nand took his way through the forest. With this Sir Palomides and Sir\nTristram were on foot, and gat their horses again, and either asked\ncounsel of other, what was best to do. By my head, said Sir Tristram, I\nwill follow this strong knight that thus hath shamed us. Well, said Sir\nPalomides, and I will repose me hereby with a friend of mine. Beware,\nsaid Sir Tristram unto Palomides, that ye fail not that day that ye have\nset with me to do battle, for, as I deem, ye will not hold your day, for\nI am much bigger than ye. As for that, said Sir Palomides, be it as it\nbe may, for I fear you not, for an I be not sick nor prisoner, I will\nnot fail you; but I have cause to have more doubt of you that ye will\nnot meet with me, for ye ride after yonder strong knight. And if ye meet\nwith him it is an hard adventure an ever ye escape his hands. Right\nso Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides departed, and either took their ways\ndiverse.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. How Sir Tristram sought a strong knight that had smitten him down, and\nmany other knights of the Round Table.\n\n\nAND so Sir Tristram rode long after this strong knight. And at the last\nhe saw where lay a lady overthwart a dead knight. Fair lady, said Sir\nTristram, who hath slain your lord? Sir, she said, here came a knight\nriding, as my lord and I rested us here, and asked him of whence he was,\nand my lord said of Arthur's court. Therefore, said the strong knight,\nI will joust with thee, for I hate all these that be of Arthur's court.\nAnd my lord that lieth here dead amounted upon his horse, and the strong\nknight and my lord encountered together, and there he smote my lord\nthroughout with his spear, and thus he hath brought me in great woe and\ndamage. That me repenteth, said Sir Tristram, of your great anger; an\nit please you tell me your husband's name. Sir, said she, his name\nwas Galardoun, that would have proved a good knight. So departed Sir\nTristram from that dolorous lady, and had much evil lodging. Then on the\nthird day Sir Tristram met with Sir Gawaine and with Sir Bleoberis in a\nforest at a lodge, and either were sore wounded. Then Sir Tristram asked\nSir Gawaine and Sir Bleoberis if they met with such a knight, with such\na cognisance, with a covered shield. Fair sir, said these knights, such\na knight met with us to our great damage. And first he smote down my\nfellow, Sir Bleoberis, and sore wounded him because he bade me I should\nnot have ado with him, for why he was overstrong for me. That strong\nknight took his words at scorn, and said he said it for mockery. And\nthen they rode together, and so he hurt my fellow. And when he had done\nso I might not for shame but I must joust with him. And at the first\ncourse he smote me down and my horse to the earth. And there he had\nalmost slain me, and from us he took his horse and departed, and in an\nevil time we met with him. Fair knights, said Sir Tristram, so he met\nwith me, and with another knight that hight Palomides, and he smote us\nboth down with one spear, and hurt us right sore. By my faith, said Sir\nGawaine, by my counsel ye shall let him pass and seek him no further;\nfor at the next feast of the Round Table, upon pain of my head ye shall\nfind him there. By my faith, said Sir Tristram, I shall never rest till\nthat I find him. And then Sir Gawaine asked him his name. Then he said:\nMy name is Sir Tristram. And so either told other their names, and then\ndeparted Sir Tristram and rode his way.\n\nAnd by fortune in a meadow Sir Tristram met with Sir Kay, the Seneschal,\nand Sir Dinadan. What tidings with you, said Sir Tristram, with you\nknights? Not good, said these knights. Why so? said Sir Tristram; I pray\nyou tell me, for I ride to seek a knight. What cognisance beareth he?\nsaid Sir Kay. He beareth, said Sir Tristram, a covered shield close with\ncloth. By my head, said Sir Kay, that is the same knight that met with\nus, for this night we were lodged within a widow's house, and there was\nthat knight lodged; and when he wist we were of Arthur's court he spoke\ngreat villainy by the king, and specially by the Queen Guenever, and\nthen on the morn was waged battle with him for that cause. And at the\nfirst recounter, said Sir Kay, he smote me down from my horse and hurt\nme passing sore; and when my fellow, Sir Dinadan, saw me smitten\ndown and hurt he would not revenge me, but fled from me; and thus he\ndeparted. And then Sir Tristram asked them their names, and so either\ntold other their names. And so Sir Tristram departed from Sir Kay, and\nfrom Sir Dinadan, and so he passed through a great forest into a plain,\ntill he was ware of a priory, and there he reposed him with a good man\nsix days.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. How Sir Tristram smote down Sir Sagramore le Desirous and\nSir Dodinas le Savage.\n\n\nAND then he sent his man that hight Gouvernail, and commanded him to go\nto a city thereby to fetch him new harness; for it was long time afore\nthat that Sir Tristram had been refreshed, his harness was brised and\nbroken. And when Gouvernail, his servant, was come with his apparel, he\ntook his leave at the widow, and mounted upon his horse, and rode his\nway early on the morn. And by sudden adventure Sir Tristram met with\nSir Sagramore le Desirous, and with Sir Dodinas le Savage. And these two\nknights met with Sir Tristram and questioned with him, and asked him if\nhe would joust with them. Fair knights, said Sir Tristram, with a good\nwill I would joust with you, but I have promised at a day set, near\nhand, to do battle with a strong knight; and therefore I am loath to\nhave ado with you, for an it misfortuned me here to be hurt I should not\nbe able to do my battle which I promised. As for that, said Sagramore,\nmaugre your head, ye shall joust with us or ye pass from us. Well, said\nSir Tristram, if ye enforce me thereto I must do what I may. And then\nthey dressed their shields, and came running together with great ire.\nBut through Sir Tristram's great force he struck Sir Sagramore from\nhis horse. Then he hurled his horse farther, and said to Sir Dodinas:\nKnight, make thee ready; and so through fine force Sir Tristram struck\nDodinas from his horse. And when he saw them lie on the earth he took\nhis bridle, and rode forth on his way, and his man Gouvernail with him.\n\nAnon as Sir Tristram was passed, Sir Sagramore and Sir Dodinas gat again\ntheir horses, and mounted up lightly and followed after Sir Tristram.\nAnd when Sir Tristram saw them come so fast after him he returned with\nhis horse to them, and asked them what they would. It is not long ago\nsithen I smote you to the earth at your own request and desire: I would\nhave ridden by you, but ye would not suffer me, and now meseemeth ye\nwould do more battle with me. That is truth, said Sir Sagramore and Sir\nDodinas, for we will be revenged of the despite ye have done to us. Fair\nknights, said Sir Tristram, that shall little need you, for all that\nI did to you ye caused it; wherefore I require you of your knighthood\nleave me as at this time, for I am sure an I do battle with you I shall\nnot escape without great hurts, and as I suppose ye shall not escape all\nlotless. And this is the cause why I am so loath to have ado with you;\nfor I must fight within these three days with a good knight, and as\nvaliant as any is now living, and if I be hurt I shall not be able to do\nbattle with him. What knight is that, said Sir Sagramore, that ye shall\nfight withal? Sirs, said he, it is a good knight called Sir Palomides.\nBy my head, said Sir Sagramore and Sir Dodinas, ye have cause to dread\nhim, for ye shall find him a passing good knight, and a valiant. And\nbecause ye shall have ado with him we will forbear you as at this time,\nand else ye should not escape us lightly. But, fair knight, said Sir\nSagramore, tell us your name. Sir, said he, my name is Sir Tristram de\nLiones. Ah, said Sagramore and Sir Dodinas, well be ye found, for much\nworship have we heard of you. And then either took leave of other, and\ndeparted on their way.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. How Sir Tristram met at the peron with Sir Launcelot, and how\nthey fought together unknown.\n\n\nTHEN departed Sir Tristram and rode straight unto Camelot, to the peron\nthat Merlin had made to-fore, where Sir Lanceor, that was the king's son\nof Ireland, was slain by the hands of Balin. And in that same place was\nthe fair lady Colombe slain, that was love unto Sir Lanceor; for after\nhe was dead she took his sword and thrust it through her body. And by\nthe craft of Merlin he made to inter this knight, Lanceor, and his lady,\nColombe, under one stone. And at that time Merlin prophesied that in\nthat same place should fight two the best knights that ever were in\nArthur's days, and the best lovers. So when Sir Tristram came to the\ntomb where Lanceor and his lady were buried he looked about him after\nSir Palomides. Then was he ware of a seemly knight came riding against\nhim all in white, with a covered shield. When he came nigh Sir Tristram\nhe said on high: Ye be welcome, sir knight, and well and truly have ye\nholden your promise. And then they dressed their shields and spears,\nand came together with all their might of their horses; and they met so\nfiercely that both their horses and knights fell to the earth, and as\nfast as they might avoided their horses, and put their shields afore\nthem; and they struck together with bright swords, as men that were of\nmight, and either wounded other wonderly sore, that the blood ran out\nupon the grass. And thus they fought the space of four hours, that never\none would speak to other one word, and of their harness they had hewn\noff many pieces. O Lord Jesu, said Gouvernail, I marvel greatly of\nthe strokes my master hath given to your master. By my head, said Sir\nLauncelot's servant, your master hath not given so many but your master\nhas received as many or more. O Jesu, said Gouvernail, it is too much\nfor Sir Palomides to suffer or Sir Launcelot, and yet pity it were that\neither of these good knights should destroy other's blood. So they\nstood and wept both, and made great dole when they saw the bright swords\nover-covered with blood of their bodies.\n\nThen at the last spake Sir Launcelot and said: Knight, thou fightest\nwonderly well as ever I saw knight, therefore, an it please you, tell me\nyour name. Sir, said Sir Tristram, that is me loath to tell any man my\nname. Truly, said Sir Launcelot, an I were required I was never loath to\ntell my name. It is well said, said Sir Tristram, then I require you\nto tell me your name? Fair knight, he said, my name is Sir Launcelot du\nLake. Alas, said Sir Tristram, what have I done! for ye are the man in\nthe world that I love best. Fair knight, said Sir Launcelot, tell me\nyour name? Truly, said he, my name is Sir Tristram de Liones. O Jesu,\nsaid Sir Launcelot, what adventure is befallen me! And therewith Sir\nLauncelot kneeled down and yielded him up his sword. And therewith Sir\nTristram kneeled adown, and yielded him up his sword. And so either gave\nother the degree. And then they both forthwithal went to the stone, and\nset them down upon it, and took off their helms to cool them, and either\nkissed other an hundred times. And then anon after they took off their\nhelms and rode to Camelot. And there they met with Sir Gawaine and with\nSir Gaheris that had made promise to Arthur never to come again to the\ncourt till they had brought Sir Tristram with them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. How Sir Launcelot brought Sir Tristram to the court, and\nof the great joy that the king and other made for the coming of Sir\nTristram.\n\n\nRETURN again, said Sir Launcelot, for your quest is done, for I have\nmet with Sir Tristram: lo, here is his own person! Then was Sir Gawaine\nglad, and said to Sir Tristram: Ye are welcome, for now have ye eased\nme greatly of my labour. For what cause, said Sir Gawaine, came ye\ninto this court? Fair sir, said Sir Tristram, I came into this country\nbecause of Sir Palomides; for he and I had assigned at this day to have\ndone battle together at the peron, and I marvel I hear not of him. And\nthus by adventure my lord, Sir Launcelot, and I met together. With this\ncame King Arthur, and when he wist that there was Sir Tristram, then he\nran unto him and took him by the hand and said: Sir Tristram, ye are as\nwelcome as any knight that ever came to this court. And when the king\nhad heard how Sir Launcelot and he had foughten, and either had wounded\nother wonderly sore, then the king made great dole. Then Sir Tristram\ntold the king how he came thither for to have had ado with Sir\nPalomides. And then he told the king how he had rescued him from the\nnine knights and Breuse Saunce Pit\u00e9; and how he found a knight lying by\na well, and that knight smote down Sir Palomides and me, but his shield\nwas covered with a cloth. So Sir Palomides left me, and I followed after\nthat knight; and in many places I found where he had slain knights, and\nforjousted many. By my head, said Sir Gawaine, that same knight smote\nme down and Sir Bleoberis, and hurt us sore both, he with the covered\nshield. Ah, said Sir Kay, that knight smote me adown and hurt me passing\nsore, and fain would I have known him, but I might not. Jesu, mercy,\nsaid Arthur, what knight was that with the covered shield? I know not,\nsaid Sir Tristram; and so said they all. Now, said King Arthur, then wot\nI, for it is Sir Launcelot. Then they all looked upon Sir Launcelot and\nsaid: Ye have beguiled us with your covered shield. It is not the first\ntime, said Arthur, he hath done so. My lord, said Sir Launcelot, truly\nwit ye well I was the same knight that bare the covered shield; and\nbecause I would not be known that I was of your court I said no worship\nof your house. That is truth, said Sir Gawaine, Sir Kay, and Sir\nBleoberis.\n\nThen King Arthur took Sir Tristram by the hand and went to the Table\nRound. Then came Queen Guenever and many ladies with her, and all the\nladies said at one voice: Welcome, Sir Tristram! Welcome, said the\ndamosels. Welcome, said knights. Welcome, said Arthur, for one of\nthe best knights, and the gentlest of the world, and the man of most\nworship; for of all manner of hunting thou bearest the prize, and of\nall measures of blowing thou art the beginning, and of all the terms of\nhunting and hawking ye are the beginner, of all instruments of music ye\nare the best; therefore, gentle knight, said Arthur, ye are welcome to\nthis court. And also, I pray you, said Arthur, grant me a boon. It shall\nbe at your commandment, said Tristram. Well, said Arthur, I will desire\nof you that ye will abide in my court. Sir, said Sir Tristram, thereto\nis me loath, for I have ado in many countries. Not so, said Arthur, ye\nhave promised it me, ye may not say nay. Sir, said Sir Tristram, I will\nas ye will. Then went Arthur unto the sieges about the Round Table, and\nlooked in every siege the which were void that lacked knights. And then\nthe king saw in the siege of Marhaus letters that said: This is the\nsiege of the noble knight, Sir Tristram. And then Arthur made Sir\nTristram Knight of the Table Round, with great nobley and great feast\nas might be thought. For Sir Marhaus was slain afore by the hands of Sir\nTristram in an island; and that was well known at that time in the court\nof Arthur, for this Marhaus was a worthy knight. And for evil deeds that\nhe did unto the country of Cornwall Sir Tristram and he fought. And they\nfought so long, tracing and traversing, till they fell bleeding to\nthe earth; for they were so sore wounded that they might not stand for\nbleeding. And Sir Tristram by fortune recovered, and Sir Marhaus died\nthrough the stroke on the head. So leave we of Sir Tristram and speak we\nof King Mark.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. How for the despite of Sir Tristram King Mark came with two\nknights into England, and how he slew one of the knights.\n\n\nTHEN King Mark had great despite of the renown of Sir Tristram, and then\nhe chased him out of Cornwall: yet was he nephew unto King Mark, but\nhe had great suspicion unto Sir Tristram because of his queen, La Beale\nIsoud; for him seemed that there was too much love between them both. So\nwhen Sir Tristram departed out of Cornwall into England King Mark heard\nof the great prowess that Sir Tristram did there, the which grieved\nhim sore. So he sent on his part men to espy what deeds he did. And the\nqueen sent privily on her part spies to know what deeds he had done, for\ngreat love was between them twain. So when the messengers were come home\nthey told the truth as they had heard, that he passed all other knights\nbut if it were Sir Launcelot. Then King Mark was right heavy of these\ntidings, and as glad was La Beale Isoud. Then in great despite he took\nwith him two good knights and two squires, and disguised himself, and\ntook his way into England, to the intent for to slay Sir Tristram. And\none of these two knights hight Bersules, and the other knight was called\nAmant. So as they rode King Mark asked a knight that he met, where he\nshould find King Arthur. He said: At Camelot. Also he asked that knight\nafter Sir Tristram, whether he heard of him in the court of King Arthur.\nWit you well, said that knight, ye shall find Sir Tristram there for a\nman of as great worship as is now living; for through his prowess he won\nthe tournament of the Castle of Maidens that standeth by the Hard Rock.\nAnd sithen he hath won with his own hands thirty knights that were men\nof great honour. And the last battle that ever he did he fought with\nSir Launcelot; and that was a marvellous battle. And not by force Sir\nLauncelot brought Sir Tristram to the court, and of him King Arthur made\npassing great joy, and so made him Knight of the Table Round; and his\nseat was where the good knight's, Sir Marhaus, seat was. Then was King\nMark passing sorry when he heard of the honour of Sir Tristram; and so\nthey departed.\n\nThen said King Mark unto his two knights: Now will I tell you my\ncounsel: ye are the men that I trust most to alive, and I will that ye\nwit my coming hither is to this intent, for to destroy Sir Tristram by\nwiles or by treason; and it shall be hard if ever he escape our hands.\nAlas, said Sir Bersules, what mean you? for ye be set in such a way ye\nare disposed shamefully; for Sir Tristram is the knight of most worship\nthat we know living, and therefore I warn you plainly I will never\nconsent to do him to the death; and therefore I will yield my service,\nand forsake you. When King Mark heard him say so, suddenly he drew his\nsword and said: Ah, traitor; and smote Sir Bersules on the head, that\nthe sword went to his teeth. When Amant, the knight, saw him do that\nvillainous deed, and his squires, they said it was foul done, and\nmischievously: Wherefore we will do thee no more service, and wit ye\nwell, we will appeach thee of treason afore Arthur. Then was King Mark\nwonderly wroth and would have slain Amant; but he and the two squires\nheld them together, and set nought by his malice. When King Mark saw he\nmight not be revenged on them, he said thus unto the knight, Amant: Wit\nthou well, an thou appeach me of treason I shall thereof defend me afore\nKing Arthur; but I require thee that thou tell not my name, that I am\nKing Mark, whatsomever come of me. As for that, said Sir Amant, I will\nnot discover your name; and so they departed, and Amant and his fellows\ntook the body of Bersules and buried it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. How King Mark came to a fountain where he found Sir\nLamorak complaining for the love of King Lot's wife.\n\n\nTHEN King Mark rode till he came to a fountain, and there he rested him,\nand stood in a doubt whether he would ride to Arthur's court or none, or\nreturn again to his country. And as he thus rested him by that fountain\nthere came by him a knight well armed on horseback; and he alighted,\nand tied his horse until a tree, and set him down by the brink of\nthe fountain; and there he made great languor and dole, and made the\ndolefullest complaint of love that ever man heard; and all this\nwhile was he not ware of King Mark. And this was a great part of his\ncomplaint: he cried and wept, saying: O fair Queen of Orkney, King Lot's\nwife, and mother of Sir Gawaine, and to Sir Gaheris, and mother to many\nother, for thy love I am in great pains. Then King Mark arose and went\nnear him and said: Fair knight, ye have made a piteous complaint. Truly,\nsaid the knight, it is an hundred part more ruefuller than my heart can\nutter. I require you, said King Mark, tell me your name. Sir, said he,\nas for my name I will not hide it from no knight that beareth a shield,\nand my name is Sir Lamorak de Galis. But when Sir Lamorak heard King\nMark speak, then wist he well by his speech that he was a Cornish\nknight. Sir, said Sir Lamorak, I understand by your tongue ye be of\nCornwall, wherein there dwelleth the shamefullest king that is now\nliving, for he is a great enemy to all good knights; and that proveth\nwell, for he hath chased out of that country Sir Tristram, that is the\nworshipfullest knight that now is living, and all knights speak of him\nworship; and for jealousness of his queen he hath chased him out of\nhis country. It is pity, said Sir Lamorak, that ever any such false\nknight-coward as King Mark is, should be matched with such a fair lady\nand good as La Beale Isoud is, for all the world of him speaketh shame,\nand of her worship that any queen may have. I have not ado in this\nmatter, said King Mark, neither nought will I speak thereof. Well said,\nsaid Sir Lamorak. Sir, can ye tell me any tidings? I can tell you, said\nSir Lamorak, that there shall be a great tournament in haste beside\nCamelot, at the Castle of Jagent; and the King with the Hundred Knights\nand the King of Ireland, as I suppose, make that tournament.\n\nThen there came a knight that was called Sir Dinadan, and saluted\nthem both. And when he wist that King Mark was a knight of Cornwall he\nreproved him for the love of King Mark a thousand fold more than did\nSir Lamorak. Then he proffered to joust with King Mark. And he was full\nloath thereto, but Sir Dinadan edged him so, that he jousted with Sir\nLamorak. And Sir Lamorak smote King Mark so sore that he bare him on\nhis spear end over his horse's tail. And then King Mark arose again,\nand followed after Sir Lamorak. But Sir Dinadan would not joust with\nSir Lamorak, but he told King Mark that Sir Lamorak was Sir Kay, the\nSeneschal. That is not so, said King Mark, for he is much bigger than\nSir Kay; and so he followed and overtook him, and bade him abide. What\nwill you do? said Sir Lamorak. Sir, he said, I will fight with a sword,\nfor ye have shamed me with a spear; and therewith they dashed together\nwith swords, and Sir Lamorak suffered him and forbare him. And King Mark\nwas passing hasty, and smote thick strokes. Sir Lamorak saw he would not\nstint, and waxed somewhat wroth, and doubled his strokes, for he was one\nof the noblest knights of the world; and he beat him so on the helm that\nhis head hung nigh on the saddle bow. When Sir Lamorak saw him fare so,\nhe said: Sir knight, what cheer? meseemeth you have nigh your fill of\nfighting, it were pity to do you any more harm, for ye are but a mean\nknight, therefore I give you leave to go where ye list. Gramercy, said\nKing Mark, for ye and I be not matches.\n\nThen Sir Dinadan mocked King Mark and said: Ye are not able to match a\ngood knight. As for that, said King Mark, at the first time I jousted\nwith this knight ye refused him. Think ye that it is a shame to me? said\nSir Dinadan: nay, sir, it is ever worship to a knight to refuse that\nthing that he may not attain, there fore your worship had been much more\nto have refused him as I did; for I warn you plainly he is able to\nbeat such five as ye and I be; for ye knights of Cornwall are no men of\nworship as other knights are. And because ye are no men of worship\nye hate all men of worship, for never was bred in your country such a\nknight as is Sir Tristram.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. How King Mark, Sir Lamorak, and Sir Dinadan came to a\ncastle, and how King Mark was known there.\n\n\nTHEN they rode forth all together, King Mark, Sir Lamorak, and Sir\nDinadan, till that they came to a bridge, and at the end thereof stood a\nfair tower. Then saw they a knight on horseback well armed, brandishing\na spear, crying and proffering himself to joust. Now, said Sir Dinadan\nunto King Mark, yonder are two brethren, that one hight Alein, and the\nother hight Trian, that will joust with any that passeth this passage.\nNow proffer yourself, said Dinadan to King Mark, for ever ye be laid\nto the earth. Then King Mark was ashamed, and therewith he feutred his\nspear, and hurtled to Sir Trian, and either brake their spears all to\npieces, and passed through anon. Then Sir Trian sent King Mark another\nspear to joust more; but in no wise he would not joust no more. Then\nthey came to the castle all three knights, and prayed the lord of the\ncastle of harbour. Ye are right welcome, said the knights of the castle,\nfor the love of the lord of this castle, the which hight Sir Tor le Fise\nAries. And then they came into a fair court well repaired, and they\nhad passing good cheer, till the lieutenant of this castle, that hight\nBerluse, espied King Mark of Cornwall. Then said Berluse: Sir knight, I\nknow you better than you ween, for ye are King Mark that slew my father\nafore mine own eyen; and me had ye slain had I not escaped into a wood;\nbut wit ye well, for the love of my lord of this castle I will neither\nhurt you nor harm you, nor none of your fellowship. But wit ye well,\nwhen ye are past this lodging I shall hurt you an I may, for ye slew my\nfather traitorly. But first for the love of my lord, Sir Tor, and for\nthe love of Sir Lamorak, the honourable knight that here is lodged, ye\nshall have none ill lodging; for it is pity that ever ye should be in\nthe company of good knights; for ye are the most villainous knight or\nking that is now known alive, for ye are a destroyer of good knights,\nand all that ye do is but treason.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. How Sir Berluse met with King Mark, and how Sir Dinadan took\nhis part.\n\n\nTHEN was King Mark sore ashamed, and said but little again. But when Sir\nLamorak and Sir Dinadan wist that he was King Mark they were sorry of\nhis fellowship. So after supper they went to lodging. So on the morn\nthey arose early, and King Mark and Sir Dinadan rode together; and\nthree mile from their lodging there met with them three knights, and Sir\nBerluse was one, and that other his two cousins. Sir Berluse saw King\nMark, and then he cried on high: Traitor, keep thee from me for wit thou\nwell that I am Berluse. Sir knight, said Sir Dinadan, I counsel you to\nleave off at this time, for he is riding to King Arthur; and because I\nhave promised to conduct him to my lord King Arthur needs must I take\na part with him; howbeit I love not his condition, and fain I would be\nfrom him. Well, Dinadan, said Sir Berluse, me repenteth that ye will\ntake part with him, but now do your best. And then he hurtled to King\nMark, and smote him sore upon the shield, that he bare him clean out of\nhis saddle to the earth. That saw Sir Dinadan, and he feutred his spear,\nand ran to one of Berluse's fellows, and smote him down off his saddle.\nThen Dinadan turned his horse, and smote the third knight in the same\nwise to the earth, for Sir Dinadan was a good knight on horseback;\nand there began a great battle, for Berluse and his fellows held them\ntogether strongly on foot. And so through the great force of Sir Dinadan\nKing Mark had Berluse to the earth, and his two fellows fled; and had\nnot been Sir Dinadan King Mark would have slain him. And so Sir Dinadan\nrescued him of his life, for King Mark was but a murderer. And then they\ntook their horses and departed and left Sir Berluse there sore wounded.\n\nThen King Mark and Sir Dinadan rode forth a four leagues English, till\nthat they came to a bridge where hoved a knight on horseback, armed and\nready to joust. Lo, said Sir Dinadan unto King Mark, yonder hoveth a\nknight that will joust, for there shall none pass this bridge but he\nmust joust with that knight. It is well, said King Mark, for this jousts\nfalleth with thee. Sir Dinadan knew the knight well that he was a noble\nknight, and fain he would have jousted, but he had had liefer King Mark\nhad jousted with him, but by no mean King Mark would not joust. Then Sir\nDinadan might not refuse him in no manner. And then either dressed their\nspears and their shields, and smote together, so that through fine force\nSir Dinadan was smitten to the earth; and lightly he rose up and gat\nhis horse, and required that knight to do battle with swords. And he\nanswered and said: Fair knight, as at this time I may not have ado\nwith you no more, for the custom of this passage is such. Then was Sir\nDinadan passing wroth that he might not be revenged of that knight; and\nso he departed, and in no wise would that knight tell his name. But ever\nSir Dinadan thought he should know him by his shield that it should be\nSir Tor.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. How King Mark mocked Sir Dinadan, and how they met with six\nknights of the Round Table.\n\n\nSo as they rode by the way King Mark then began to mock Sir Dinadan, and\nsaid: I weened you knights of the Table Round might not in no wise find\ntheir matches. Ye say well, said Sir Dinadan; as for you, on my life I\ncall you none of the best knights; but sith ye have such a despite at me\nI require you to joust with me to prove my strength. Not so, said King\nMark, for I will not have ado with you in no manner; but I require you\nof one thing, that when ye come to Arthur's court discover not my name,\nfor I am there so hated. It is shame to you, said Sir Dinadan, that ye\ngovern you so shamefully; for I see by you ye are full of cowardice,\nand ye are a murderer, and that is the greatest shame that a knight may\nhave; for never a knight being a murderer hath worship, nor never\nshall have; for I saw but late through my force ye would have slain\nSir Berluse, a better knight than ye, or ever ye shall be, and more of\nprowess. Thus they rode forth talking till they came to a fair place,\nwhere stood a knight, and prayed them to take their lodging with him.\nSo at the request of that knight they reposed them there, and made them\nwell at ease, and had great cheer. For all errant-knights were welcome\nto him, and specially all those of Arthur's court. Then Sir Dinadan\ndemanded his host what was the knight's name that kept the bridge. For\nwhat cause ask you it? said the host. For it is not long ago, said\nSir Dinadan, sithen he gave me a fall. Ah, fair knight, said his host,\nthereof have ye no marvel, for he is a passing good knight, and his name\nis Sir Tor, the son of Aries le Vaysher. Ah, said Sir Dinadan, was that\nSir Tor? for truly so ever me thought.\n\nRight as they stood thus talking together they saw come riding to them\nover a plain six knights of the court of King Arthur, well armed at all\npoints. And there by their shields Sir Dinadan knew them well. The first\nwas the good knight Sir Uwaine, the son of King Uriens, the second was\nthe noble knight Sir Brandiles, the third was Ozana le Cure Hardy, the\nfourth was Uwaine les Aventurous, the fifth was Sir Agravaine, the sixth\nSir Mordred, brother to Sir Gawaine. When Sir Dinadan had seen these six\nknights he thought in himself he would bring King Mark by some wile to\njoust with one of them. And anon they took their horses and ran after\nthese knights well a three mile English. Then was King Mark ware where\nthey sat all six about a well, and ate and drank such meats as they had,\nand their horses walking and some tied, and their shields hung in divers\nplaces about them. Lo, said Sir Dinadan, yonder are knights-errant that\nwill joust with us. God forbid, said King Mark, for they be six and we\nbut two. As for that, said Sir Dinadan, let us not spare, for I will\nassay the foremost; and therewith he made him ready. When King Mark\nsaw him do so, as fast as Sir Dinadan rode toward them, King Mark rode\nfroward them with all his menial meiny. So when Sir Dinadan saw King\nMark was gone, he set the spear out of the rest, and threw his shield\nupon his back, and came, riding to the fellowship of the Table Round.\nAnd anon Sir Uwaine knew Sir Dinadan, and welcomed him, and so did all\nhis fellowship.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. How the six knights sent Sir Dagonet to joust with King\nMark, and how King Mark refused him.\n\n\nAND then they asked him of his adventures, and whether he had seen Sir\nTristram or Sir Launcelot. So God me help, said Sir Dinadan, I saw none\nof them sithen I departed from Camelot. What knight is that, said Sir\nBrandiles, that so suddenly departed from you, and rode over yonder\nfield? Sir, said he, it was a knight of Cornwall, and the most horrible\ncoward that ever bestrode horse. What is his name? said all these\nknights. I wot not, said Sir Dinadan. So when they had reposed them, and\nspoken together, they took their horses and rode to a castle where\ndwelt an old knight that made all knights-errant good cheer. Then in\nthe meanwhile that they were talking came into the castle Sir Griflet le\nFise de Dieu, and there was he welcome; and they all asked him whether\nhe had seen Sir Launcelot or Sir Tristram. Sirs, he answered, I saw him\nnot sithen he departed from Camelot. So as Sir Dinadan walked and\nbeheld the castle, thereby in a chamber he espied King Mark, and then he\nrebuked him, and asked him why he departed so. Sir, said he, for I durst\nnot abide because they were so many. But how escaped ye? said King Mark.\nSir, said Sir Dinadan, they were better friends than I weened they had\nbeen. Who is captain of that fellowship? said the king. Then for to fear\nhim Sir Dinadan said that it was Sir Launcelot. O Jesu, said the king,\nmight I know Sir Launcelot by his shield? Yea, said Dinadan, for he\nbeareth a shield of silver and black bends. All this he said to fear the\nking, for Sir Launcelot was not in his fellowship. Now I pray you, said\nKing Mark, that ye will ride in my fellowship. That is me loath to do,\nsaid Sir Dinadan, because ye forsook my fellowship.\n\nRight so Sir Dinadan went from King Mark, and went to his own\nfellowship; and so they mounted upon their horses, and rode on their\nways, and talked of the Cornish knight, for Dinadan told them that he\nwas in the castle where they were lodged. It is well said, said Sir\nGriflet, for here have I brought Sir Dagonet, King Arthur's fool, that\nis the best fellow and the merriest in the world. Will ye do well? said\nSir Dinadan: I have told the Cornish knight that here is Sir Launcelot,\nand the Cornish knight asked me what shield he bare. Truly, I told him\nthat he bare the same shield that Sir Mordred beareth. Will ye do well?\nsaid Sir Mordred; I am hurt and may not well bear my shield nor harness,\nand therefore put my shield and my harness upon Sir Dagonet, and let him\nset upon the Cornish knight. That shall be done, said Sir Dagonet, by\nmy faith. Then anon was Dagonet armed him in Mordred's harness and his\nshield, and he was set on a great horse, and a spear in his hand. Now,\nsaid Dagonet, shew me the knight, and I trow I shall bear him down. So\nall these knights rode to a woodside, and abode till King Mark came by\nthe way. Then they put forth Sir Dagonet, and he came on all the while\nhis horse might run, straight upon King Mark. And when he came nigh King\nMark, he cried as he were wood, and said: Keep thee, knight of Cornwall,\nfor I will slay thee. Anon, as King Mark beheld his shield, he said\nto himself: Yonder is Sir Launcelot; alas, now am I destroyed; and\ntherewithal he made his horse to run as fast as it might through thick\nand thin. And ever Sir Dagonet followed after King Mark, crying and\nrating him as a wood man, through a great forest. When Sir Uwaine and\nSir Brandiles saw Dagonet so chase King Mark, they laughed all as they\nwere wood. And then they took their horses, and rode after to see how\nSir Dagonet sped, for they would not for no good that Sir Dagonet were\nshent, for King Arthur loved him passing well, and made him knight with\nhis own hands. And at every tournament he began to make King Arthur to\nlaugh. Then the knights rode here and there, crying and chasing after\nKing Mark, that all the forest rang of the noise.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. How Sir Palomides by adventure met King Mark flying, and\nhow he overthrew Dagonet and other knights.\n\n\nSO King Mark rode by fortune by a well, in the way where stood a\nknight-errant on horseback, armed at all points, with a great spear\nin his hand. And when he saw King Mark coming flying he said: Knight,\nreturn again for shame and stand with me, and I shall be thy warrant.\nAh, fair knight, said King Mark, let me pass, for yonder cometh after\nme the best knight of the world, with the black bended shield. Fie, for\nshame, said the knight, he is none of the worthy knights, and if he were\nSir Launcelot or Sir Tristram I should not doubt to meet the better of\nthem both. When King Mark heard him say that word, he turned his horse\nand abode by him. And then that strong knight bare a spear to Dagonet,\nand smote him so sore that he bare him over his horse's tail, and nigh\nhe had broken his neck. And anon after him came Sir Brandiles, and when\nhe saw Dagonet have that fall he was passing wroth, and cried: Keep\nthee, knight, and so they hurtled together wonder sore. But the knight\nsmote Sir Brandiles so sore that he went to the earth, horse and man.\nSir Uwaine came after and saw all this. Jesu, said he, yonder is a\nstrong knight. And then they feutred their spears, and this knight came\nso eagerly that he smote down Sir Uwaine. Then came Ozana with the hardy\nheart, and he was smitten down. Now, said Sir Griflet, by my counsel\nlet us send to yonder errant-knight, and wit whether he be of Arthur's\ncourt, for as I deem it is Sir Lamorak de Galis. So they sent unto him,\nand prayed the strange knight to tell his name, and whether he were of\nArthur's court or not. As for my name they shall not wit, but tell them\nI am a knight-errant as they are, and let them wit that I am no knight\nof King Arthur's court; and so the squire rode again unto them and told\nthem his answer of him. By my head, said Sir Agravaine, he is one of the\nstrongest knights that ever I saw, for he hath overthrown three\nnoble knights, and needs we must encounter with him for shame. So Sir\nAgravaine feutred his spear, and that other was ready, and smote him\ndown over his horse to the earth. And in the same wise he smote Sir\nUwaine les Avoutres and also Sir Griflet. Then had he served them all\nbut Sir Dinadan, for he was behind, and Sir Mordred was unarmed, and\nDagonet had his harness.\n\nSo when this was done, this strong knight rode on his way a soft pace,\nand King Mark rode after him, praising him mickle; but he would answer\nno words, but sighed wonderly sore, hanging down his head, taking no\nheed to his words. Thus they rode well a three mile English, and then\nthis knight called to him a varlet, and bade him ride until yonder fair\nmanor, and recommend me to the lady of that castle and place, and pray\nher to send me refreshing of good meats and drinks. And if she ask thee\nwhat I am, tell her that I am the knight that followeth the glatisant\nbeast: that is in English to say the questing beast; for that beast\nwheresomever he yede he quested in the belly with such a noise as it had\nbeen a thirty couple of hounds. Then the varlet went his way and came to\nthe manor, and saluted the lady, and told her from whence he came.\nAnd when she understood that he came from the knight that followed the\nquesting beast: O sweet Lord Jesu, she said, when shall I see that noble\nknight, my dear son Palomides? Alas, will he not abide with me? and\ntherewith she swooned and wept, and made passing great dole. And then\nalso soon as she might she gave the varlet all that he asked. And the\nvarlet returned unto Sir Palomides, for he was a varlet of King Mark.\nAnd as soon as he came, he told the knight's name was Sir Palomides. I\nam well pleased, said King Mark, but hold thee still and say nothing.\nThen they alighted and set them down and reposed them a while. Anon\nwithal King Mark fell asleep. When Sir Palomides saw him sound asleep he\ntook his horse and rode his way, and said to them: I will not be in the\ncompany of a sleeping knight. And so he rode forth a great pace.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. How King Mark and Sir Dinadan heard Sir Palomides making\ngreat sorrow and mourning for La Beale Isoud.\n\n\nNOW turn we unto Sir Dinadan, that found these seven knights passing\nheavy. And when he wist how that they sped, as heavy was he. My lord\nUwaine, said Dinadan, I dare lay my head it is Sir Lamorak de Galis. I\npromise you all I shall find him an he may be found in this country. And\nso Sir Dinadan rode after this knight; and so did King Mark, that sought\nhim through the forest. So as King Mark rode after Sir Palomides he\nheard the noise of a man that made great dole. Then King Mark rode\nas nigh that noise as he might and as he durst. Then was he ware of a\nknight that was descended off his horse, and had put off his helm, and\nthere he made a piteous complaint and a dolorous, of love.\n\nNow leave we that, and talk we of Sir Dinadan, that rode to seek Sir\nPalomides. And as he came within a forest he met with a knight, a chaser\nof a deer. Sir, said Sir Dinadan, met ye with a knight with a shield of\nsilver and lions' heads? Yea, fair knight, said the other, with such a\nknight met I with but a while agone, and straight yonder way he yede.\nGramercy, said Sir Dinadan, for might I find the track of his horse I\nshould not fail to find that knight. Right so as Sir Dinadan rode in the\neven late he heard a doleful noise as it were of a man. Then Sir Dinadan\nrode toward that noise; and when he came nigh that noise he alighted off\nhis horse, and went near him on foot. Then was he ware of a knight that\nstood under a tree, and his horse tied by him, and the helm off his\nhead; and ever that knight made a doleful complaint as ever made\nknight. And always he made his complaint of La Beale Isoud, the Queen of\nCornwall, and said: Ah, fair lady, why love I thee! for thou art fairest\nof all other, and yet showest thou never love to me, nor bounty. Alas,\nyet must I love thee. And I may not blame thee, fair lady, for mine eyes\nbe cause of this sorrow. And yet to love thee I am but a fool, for the\nbest knight of the world loveth thee, and ye him again, that is Sir\nTristram de Liones. And the falsest king and knight is your husband, and\nthe most coward and full of treason, is your lord, King Mark. Alas, that\never so fair a lady and peerless of all other should be matched with the\nmost villainous knight of the world. All this language heard King Mark,\nwhat Sir Palomides said by him; wherefore he was adread when he saw Sir\nDinadan, lest he espied him, that he would tell Sir Palomides that he\nwas King Mark; and therefore he withdrew him, and took his horse and\nrode to his men, where he commanded them to abide. And so he rode as\nfast as he might unto Camelot; and the same day he found there Amant,\nthe knight, ready that afore Arthur had appealed him of treason; and so,\nlightly the king commanded them to do battle. And by misadventure King\nMark smote Amant through the body. And yet was Amant in the righteous\nquarrel. And right so he took his horse and departed from the court for\ndread of Sir Dinadan, that he would tell Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides\nwhat he was. Then were there maidens that La Beale Isoud had sent to Sir\nTristram, that knew Sir Amant well.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. How King Mark had slain Sir Amant wrongfully to-fore King\nArthur, and Sir Launcelot fetched King Mark to King Arthur.\n\n\nTHEN by the license of King Arthur they went to him and spake with him;\nfor while the truncheon of the spear stuck in his body he spake: Ah,\nfair damosels, said Amant, recommend me unto La Beale Isoud, and tell\nher that I am slain for the love of her and of Sir Tristram. And there\nhe told the damosels how cowardly King Mark had slain him, and Sir\nBersules, his fellow. And for that deed I appealed him of treason, and\nhere am I slain in a righteous quarrel; and all was because Sir Bersules\nand I would not consent by treason to slay the noble knight, Sir\nTristram. Then the two maidens cried aloud that all the court might\nhear it, and said: O sweet Lord Jesu, that knowest all hid things, why\nsufferest Thou so false a traitor to vanquish and slay a true knight\nthat fought in a righteous quarrel? Then anon it was sprung to the king,\nand the queen, and to all the lords, that it was King Mark that had\nslain Sir Amant, and Sir Bersules afore hand; wherefore they did their\nbattle. Then was King Arthur wroth out of measure, and so were all the\nother knights. But when Sir Tristram knew all the matter he made great\ndole and sorrow out of measure, and wept for sorrow for the loss of the\nnoble knights, Sir Bersules and of Sir Amant.\n\nWhen Sir Launcelot espied Sir Tristram weep he went hastily to King\nArthur, and said: Sir, I pray you give me leave to return again to\nyonder false king and knight. I pray you, said King Arthur, fetch\nhim again, but I would not that ye slew him, for my worship. Then Sir\nLauncelot armed him in all haste, and mounted upon a great horse, and\ntook a spear in his hand and rode after King Mark. And from thence\na three mile English Sir Launcelot over took him, and bade him: Turn\nrecreant king and knight, for whether thou wilt or not thou shalt go\nwith me to King Arthur's court. King Mark returned and looked upon Sir\nLauncelot, and said: Fair sir, what is your name? Wit thou well, said\nhe, my name is Sir Launcelot, and therefore defend thee. And when King\nMark wist that it was Sir Launcelot, and came so fast upon him with\na spear, he cried then aloud: I yield me to thee, Sir Launcelot,\nhonourable knight. But Sir Launcelot would not hear him, but came fast\nupon him. King Mark saw that, and made no defence, but tumbled adown out\nof his saddle to the earth as a sack, and there he lay still, and cried\nSir Launcelot mercy. Arise, recreant knight and king. I will not fight,\nsaid King Mark, but whither that ye will I will go with you. Alas, alas,\nsaid Sir Launcelot, that I may not give thee one buffet for the love of\nSir Tristram and of La Beale Isoud, and for the two knights that thou\nhast slain traitorly. And so he mounted upon his horse and brought him\nto King Arthur; and there King Mark alighted in that same place, and\nthrew his helm from him upon the earth, and his sword, and fell flat to\nthe earth of King Arthur's feet, and put him in his grace and mercy. So\nGod me help, said Arthur, ye are welcome in a manner, and in a manner\nye are not welcome. In this manner ye are welcome, that ye come hither\nmaugre thy head, as I suppose. That is truth, said King Mark, and else I\nhad not been here, for my lord, Sir Launcelot, brought me hither through\nhis fine force, and to him am I yolden to as recreant. Well, said\nArthur, ye understand ye ought to do me service, homage, and fealty.\nAnd never would ye do me none, but ever ye have been against me, and\na destroyer of my knights; now, how will ye acquit you? Sir, said King\nMark, right as your lordship will require me, unto my power, I will make\na large amends. For he was a fair speaker, and false thereunder. Then\nfor great pleasure of Sir Tristram, to make them twain accorded, the\nking withheld King Mark as at that time, and made a broken love-day\nbetween them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. How Sir Dinadan told Sir Palomides of the battle between\nSir Launcelot and Sir Tristam.\n\n\nNOW turn we again unto Sir Palomides, how Sir Dinadan comforted him in\nall that he might, from his great sorrow. What knight are ye? said Sir\nPalomides. Sir, I am a knight-errant as ye be, that hath sought you long\nby your shield. Here is my shield, said Sir Palomides, wit ye well, an\nye will ought, therewith I will defend it. Nay, said Sir Dinadan, I will\nnot have ado with you but in good manner. And if ye will, ye shall find\nme soon ready. Sir, said Sir Dinadan, whitherward ride you this way? By\nmy head, said Sir Palomides, I wot not, but as fortune leadeth me. Heard\nye or saw ye ought of Sir Tristram? So God me help, of Sir Tristram\nI both heard and saw, and not for then we loved not inwardly well\ntogether, yet at my mischief Sir Tristram rescued me from my death; and\nyet, or he and I departed, by both our assents we assigned a day that we\nshould have met at the stony grave that Merlin set beside Camelot,\nand there to have done battle together; howbeit I was letted, said Sir\nPalomides, that I might not hold my day, the which grieveth me sore; but\nI have a large excuse. For I was prisoner with a lord, and many other\nmore, and that shall Sir Tristram right well understand, that I brake\nit not of fear of cowardice. And then Sir Palomides told Sir Dinadan the\nsame day that they should have met. So God me help, said Sir Dinadan,\nthat same day met Sir Launcelot and Sir Tristram at the same grave of\nstone. And there was the most mightiest battle that ever was seen in\nthis land betwixt two knights, for they fought more than two hours. And\nthere they both bled so much blood that all men marvelled that ever they\nmight endure it. And so at the last, by both their assents, they were\nmade friends and sworn-brethren for ever, and no man can judge the\nbetter knight. And now is Sir Tristram made a knight of the Round Table,\nand he sitteth in the siege of the noble knight, Sir Marhaus. By my\nhead, said Sir Palomides, Sir Tristram is far bigger than Sir Launcelot,\nand the hardier knight. Have ye assayed them both? said Sir Dinadan.\nI have seen Sir Tristram fight, said Sir Palomides, but never Sir\nLauncelot to my witting. But at the fountain where Sir Launcelot lay\nasleep, there with one spear he smote down Sir Tristram and me, said\nPalomides, but at that time they knew not either other. Fair knight,\nsaid Sir Dinadan, as for Sir Launcelot and Sir Tristram let them be, for\nthe worst of them will not be lightly matched of no knights that I know\nliving. No, said Sir Palomides, God defend, but an I had a quarrel to\nthe better of them both I would with as good a will fight with him as\nwith you. Sir, I require you tell me your name, and in good faith I\nshall hold you company till that we come to Camelot; and there shall ye\nhave great worship now at this great tournament; for there shall be\nthe Queen Guenever, and La Beale Isoud of Cornwall. Wit you well, sir\nknight, for the love of La Beale Isoud I will be there, and else not,\nbut I will not have ado in King Arthur's court. Sir, said Dinadan, I\nshall ride with you and do you service, so you will tell me your name.\nSir, ye shall understand my name is Sir Palomides, brother to Safere,\nthe good and noble knight. And Sir Segwarides and I, we be Saracens\nborn, of father and mother. Sir, said Sir Dinadan, I thank you much for\nthe telling of your name. For I am glad of that I know your name, and\nI promise you by the faith of my body, ye shall not be hurt by me by my\nwill, but rather be advanced. And thereto will I help you with all my\npower, I promise you, doubt ye not. And certainly on my life ye shall\nwin great worship in the court of King Arthur, and be right welcome. So\nthen they dressed on their helms and put on their shields, and mounted\nupon their horses, and took the broad way towards Camelot. And then were\nthey ware of a castle that was fair and rich, and also passing strong as\nany was within this realm.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. How Sir Lamorak jousted with divers knights of the castle\nwherein was Morgan le Fay.\n\n\nSIR PALOMIDES, said Dinadan, here is a castle that I know well, and\ntherein dwelleth Queen Morgan le Fay, King Arthur's sister; and King\nArthur gave her this castle, the which he hath repented him sithen a\nthousand times, for sithen King Arthur and she have been at debate and\nstrife; but this castle could he never get nor win of her by no manner\nof engine; and ever as she might she made war on King Arthur. And all\ndangerous knights she withholdeth with her, for to destroy all these\nknights that King Arthur loveth. And there shall no knight pass this way\nbut he must joust with one knight, or with two, or with three. And if it\nhap that King Arthur's knight be beaten, he shall lose his horse and his\nharness and all that he hath, and hard, if that he escape, but that he\nshall be prisoner. So God me help, said Palomides, this is a shameful\ncustom, and a villainous usance for a queen to use, and namely to make\nsuch war upon her own lord, that is called the Flower of Chivalry that\nis christian or heathen; and with all my heart I would destroy that\nshameful custom. And I will that all the world wit she shall have no\nservice of me. And if she send out any knights, as I suppose she will,\nfor to joust, they shall have both their hands full. And I shall not\nfail you, said Sir Dinadan, unto my puissance, upon my life.\n\nSo as they stood on horseback afore the castle, there came a knight with\na red shield, and two squires after him; and he came straight unto\nSir Palomides, the good knight, and said to him: Fair and gentle\nknight-errant, I require thee for the love thou owest unto knighthood,\nthat ye will not have ado here with these men of this castle; for this\nwas Sir Lamorak that thus said. For I came hither to seek this deed, and\nit is my request; and therefore I beseech you, knight, let me deal, and\nif I be beaten revenge me. In the name of God, said Palomides, let\nsee how ye will speed, and we shall behold you. Then anon came forth a\nknight of the castle, and proffered to joust with the Knight with the\nRed Shield. Anon they encountered together, and he with the red shield\nsmote him so hard that he bare him over to the earth. Therewith anon\ncame another knight of the castle, and he was smitten so sore that\nhe avoided his saddle. And forthwithal came the third knight, and\nthe Knight with the Red Shield smote him to the earth. Then came Sir\nPalomides, and besought him that he might help him to joust. Fair\nknight, said he unto him, suffer me as at this time to have my will, for\nan they were twenty knights I shall not doubt them. And ever there were\nupon the walls of the castle many lords and ladies that cried and said:\nWell have ye jousted, Knight with the Red Shield. But as soon as the\nknight had smitten them down, his squire took their horses, and avoided\ntheir saddles and bridles of the horses, and turned them into the\nforest, and made the knights to be kept to the end of the jousts. Right\nso came out of the castle the fourth knight, and freshly proffered to\njoust with the Knight with the Red Shield: and he was ready, and he\nsmote him so hard that horse and man fell to the earth, and the knight's\nback brake with the fall, and his neck also. O Jesu, said Sir Palomides,\nthat yonder is a passing good knight, and the best jouster that ever\nI saw. By my head, said Sir Dinadan, he is as good as ever was Sir\nLauncelot or Sir Tristram, what knight somever he be.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. How Sir Palomides would have jousted for Sir Lamorak with\nthe knights of the castle.\n\n\nTHEN forthwithal came a knight out of the castle, with a shield bended\nwith black and with white. And anon the Knight with the Red Shield and\nhe encountered so hard that he smote the knight of the castle through\nthe bended shield and through the body, and brake the horse's back. Fair\nknight, said Sir Palomides, ye have overmuch on hand, therefore I pray\nyou let me joust, for ye had need to be reposed. Why sir, said the\nknight, seem ye that I am weak and feeble? and sir, methinketh ye\nproffer me wrong, and to me shame, when I do well enough. I tell you now\nas I told you erst; for an they were twenty knights I shall beat them,\nand if I be beaten or slain then may ye revenge me. And if ye think that\nI be weary, and ye have an appetite to joust with me, I shall find you\njousting enough. Sir, said Palomides, I said it not because I would\njoust with you, but meseemeth that ye have overmuch on hand. And\ntherefore, an ye were gentle, said the Knight with the Red Shield, ye\nshould not proffer me shame; therefore I require you to joust with me,\nand ye shall find that I am not weary. Sith ye require me, said Sir\nPalomides, take keep to yourself. Then they two knights came together as\nfast as their horses might run, and the knight smote Sir Palomides sore\non the shield that the spear went into his side a great wound, and a\nperilous. And therewithal Sir Palomides avoided his saddle. And that\nknight turned unto Sir Dinadan; and when he saw him coming he cried\naloud, and said: Sir, I will not have ado with you; but for that he let\nit not, but came straight upon him. So Sir Dinadan for shame put forth\nhis spear and all to-shivered it upon the knight. But he smote Sir\nDinadan again so hard that he smote him clean from his saddle; but their\nhorses he would not suffer his squires to meddle with, and because they\nwere knights-errant.\n\nThen he dressed him again to the castle, and jousted with seven knights\nmore, and there was none of them might withstand him, but he bare him to\nthe earth. And of these twelve knights he slew in plain jousts four.\nAnd the eight knights he made them to swear on the cross of a sword that\nthey should never use the evil customs of the castle. And when he had\nmade them to swear that oath he let them pass. And ever stood the lords\nand the ladies on the castle walls crying and saying: Knight with the\nRed Shield, ye have marvellously well done as ever we saw knight do. And\ntherewith came a knight out of the castle unarmed, and said: Knight with\nthe Red Shield, overmuch damage hast thou done to us this day, therefore\nreturn whither thou wilt, for here are no more will have ado with thee;\nfor we repent sore that ever thou camest here, for by thee is fordone\nthe old custom of this castle. And with that word he turned again into\nthe castle, and shut the gates. Then the Knight with the Red Shield\nturned and called his squires, and so passed forth on his way, and rode\na great pace.\n\nAnd when he was past Sir Palomides went to Sir Dinadan, and said: I had\nnever such a shame of one knight that ever I met; and therefore I cast\nme to ride after him, and to be revenged with my sword, for a-horseback\nI deem I shall get no worship of him. Sir Palomides, said Dinadan, ye\nshall not meddle with him by my counsel, for ye shall get no worship of\nhim; and for this cause, ye have seen him this day have had overmuch to\ndo, and overmuch travailed. By almighty Jesu, said Palomides, I shall\nnever be at ease till that I have had ado with him. Sir, said Dinadan, I\nshall give you my beholding. Well, said Palomides, then shall ye see how\nwe shall redress our mights. So they took their horses of their varlets,\nand rode after the Knight with the Red Shield; and down in a valley\nbeside a fountain they were ware where he was alighted to repose him,\nand had done off his helm for to drink at the well.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. How Sir Lamorak jousted with Sir Palomides, and hurt him\ngrievously.\n\n\nTHEN Palomides rode fast till he came nigh him. And then he said:\nKnight, remember ye of the shame ye did to me right now at the castle,\ntherefore dress thee, for I will have ado with thee. Fair knight, said\nhe to Palomides, of me ye win no worship, for ye have seen this day that\nI have been travailed sore. As for that, said Palomides, I will not let,\nfor wit ye well I will be revenged. Well, said the knight, I may happen\nto endure you. And therewithal he mounted upon his horse, and took a\ngreat spear in his hand ready for to joust. Nay, said Palomides, I will\nnot joust, for I am sure at jousting I get no prize. Fair knight,\nsaid that knight, it would beseem a knight to joust and to fight on\nhorseback. Ye shall see what I will do, said Palomides. And therewith he\nalighted down upon foot, and dressed his shield afore him and pulled out\nhis sword. Then the Knight with the Red Shield descended down from his\nhorse, and dressed his shield afore him, and so he drew out his sword.\nAnd then they came together a soft pace, and wonderly they lashed\ntogether passing thick the mountenance of an hour or ever they breathed.\nThen they traced and traversed, and waxed wonderly wroth, and either\nbehight other death; they hewed so fast with their swords that they cut\nin down half their swords and mails, that the bare flesh in some place\nstood above their harness. And when Sir Palomides beheld his fellow's\nsword over-hylled with his blood it grieved him sore: some while\nthey foined, some while they struck as wild men. But at the last Sir\nPalomides waxed faint, because of his first wound that he had at the\ncastle with a spear, for that wound grieved him wonderly sore. Fair\nknight, said Palomides, meseemeth we have assayed either other passing\nsore, and if it may please thee, I require thee of thy knighthood tell\nme thy name. Sir, said the knight to Palomides, that is me loath to\ndo, for thou hast done me wrong and no knighthood to proffer me battle,\nconsidering my great travail, but an thou wilt tell me thy name I will\ntell thee mine. Sir, said he, wit thou well my name is Palomides. Ah,\nsir, ye shall understand my name is Sir Lamorak de Galis, son and heir\nunto the good knight and king, King Pellinore, and Sir Tor, the good\nknight, is my half brother. When Sir Palomides heard him say so he\nkneeled down and asked mercy, For outrageously have I done to you this\nday; considering the great deeds of arms I have seen you do, shamefully\nand unknightly I have required you to do battle. Ah, Sir Palomides,\nsaid Sir Lamorak, overmuch have ye done and said to me. And therewith\nhe embraced him with his both hands, and said: Palomides, the worthy\nknight, in all this land is no better than ye, nor more of prowess, and\nme repenteth sore that we should fight together. So it doth not me, said\nSir Palomides, and yet am I sorer wounded than ye be; but as for that I\nshall soon thereof be whole. But certainly I would not for the fairest\ncastle in this land, but if thou and I had met, for I shall love you the\ndays of my life afore all other knights except my brother, Sir Safere.\nI say the same, said Sir Lamorak, except my brother, Sir Tor. Then came\nSir Dinadan, and he made great joy of Sir Lamorak. Then their squires\ndressed both their shields and their harness, and stopped their wounds.\nAnd thereby at a priory they rested them all night.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. How it was told Sir Launcelot that Dagonet chased King Mark,\nand how a knight overthrew him and six knights.\n\n\nNow turn we again. When Sir Ganis and Sir Brandiles with his fellows\ncame to the court of King Arthur they told the king, Sir Launcelot, and\nSir Tristram, how Sir Dagonet, the fool, chased King Mark through the\nforest, and how the strong knight smote them down all seven with one\nspear. There was great laughing and japing at King Mark and at Sir\nDagonet. But all these knights could not tell what knight it was that\nrescued King Mark. Then they asked King Mark if that he knew him, and\nhe answered and said: He named himself the Knight that followed the\nQuesting Beast, and on that name he sent one of my varlets to a place\nwhere was his mother; and when she heard from whence he came she made\npassing great dole, and discovered to my varlet his name, and said: Oh,\nmy dear son, Sir Palomides, why wilt thou not see me? And therefore,\nsir, said King Mark, it is to understand his name is Sir Palomides, a\nnoble knight. Then were all these seven knights glad that they knew his\nname.\n\nNow turn we again, for on the morn they took their horses, both Sir\nLamorak, Palomides, and Dinadan, with their squires and varlets, till\nthey saw a fair castle that stood on a mountain well closed, and thither\nthey rode, and there they found a knight that hight Galahalt, that was\nlord of that castle, and there they had great cheer and were well eased.\nSir Dinadan, said Sir Lamorak, what will ye do? Oh sir, said Dinadan,\nI will to-morrow to the court of King Arthur. By my head, said Sir\nPalomides, I will not ride these three days, for I am sore hurt, and\nmuch have I bled, and therefore I will repose me here. Truly, said Sir\nLamorak, and I will abide here with you; and when ye ride, then will\nI ride, unless that ye tarry over long; then will I take my horse.\nTherefore I pray you, Sir Dinadan, abide and ride with us. Faithfully,\nsaid Dinadan, I will not abide, for I have such a talent to see Sir\nTristram that I may not abide long from him. Ah, Dinadan, said Sir\nPalomides, now do I understand that ye love my mortal enemy, and\ntherefore how should I trust you. Well, said Dinadan, I love my lord Sir\nTristram, above all other, and him will I serve and do honour. So shall\nI, said Sir Lamorak, in all that may lie in my power.\n\nSo on the morn Sir Dinadan rode unto the court of King Arthur; and by\nthe way as he rode he saw where stood an errant knight, and made him\nready for to joust. Not so, said Dinadan, for I have no will to joust.\nWith me shall ye joust, said the knight, or that ye pass this way.\nWhether ask ye jousts, by love or by hate? The knight answered: Wit ye\nwell I ask it for love, and not for hate. It may well be so, said Sir\nDinadan, but ye proffer me hard love when ye will joust with me with a\nsharp spear. But, fair knight, said Sir Dinadan, sith ye will joust with\nme, meet with me in the court of King Arthur, and there shall I joust\nwith you. Well, said the knight, sith ye will not joust with me, I pray\nyou tell me your name. Sir knight, said he, my name is Sir Dinadan. Ah,\nsaid the knight, full well know I you for a good knight and a gentle,\nand wit you well I love you heartily. Then shall there be no jousts,\nsaid Dinadan, betwixt us. So they departed. And the same day he came to\nCamelot, where lay King Arthur. And there he saluted the king and the\nqueen, Sir Launcelot, and Sir Tristram; and all the court was glad of\nSir Dinadan, for he was gentle, wise, and courteous, and a good knight.\nAnd in especial, the valiant knight Sir Tristram loved Sir Dinadan\npassing well above all other knights save Sir Launcelot.\n\nThen the king asked Sir Dinadan what adventures he had seen. Sir, said\nDinadan, I have seen many adventures, and of some King Mark knoweth,\nbut not all. Then the king hearkened Sir Dinadan, how he told that Sir\nPalomides and he were afore the castle of Morgan le Fay, and how\nSir Lamorak took the jousts afore them, and how he forjousted twelve\nknights, and of them four he slew, and how after he smote down Sir\nPalomides and me both. I may not believe that, said the king, for\nSir Palomides is a passing good knight. That is very truth, said Sir\nDinadan, but yet I saw him better proved, hand for hand. And then he\ntold the king all that battle, and how Sir Palomides was more weaker,\nand more hurt, and more lost of his blood. And without doubt, said Sir\nDinadan, had the battle longer lasted, Palomides had been slain. O Jesu,\nsaid King Arthur, this is to me a great marvel. Sir, said Tristram,\nmarvel ye nothing thereof, for at mine advice there is not a valianter\nknight in the world living, for I know his might. And now I will say\nyou, I was never so weary of knight but if it were Sir Launcelot. And\nthere is no knight in the world except Sir Launcelot that did so well\nas Sir Lamorak. So God me help, said the king, I would that knight, Sir\nLamorak, came to this Court. Sir, said Dinadan, he will be here in short\nspace, and Sir Palomides both, but I fear that Palomides may not yet\ntravel.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. How King Arthur let do cry a jousts, and how Sir Lamorak\ncame in, and overthrew Sir Gawaine and many other.\n\n\nTHEN within three days after the king let make a jousting at a priory.\nAnd there made them ready many knights of the Round Table, for Sir\nGawaine and his brethren made them ready to joust; but Tristram,\nLauncelot, nor Dinadan, would not joust, but suffered Sir Gawaine, for\nthe love of King Arthur, with his brethren, to win the gree if they\nmight. Then on the morn they apparelled them to joust, Sir Gawaine and\nhis four brethren, and did there great deeds of arms. And Sir Ector de\nMaris did marvellously well, but Sir Gawaine passed all that fellowship;\nwherefore King Arthur and all the knights gave Sir Gawaine the honour at\nthe beginning.\n\nRight so King Arthur was ware of a knight and two squires, the which\ncame out of a forest side, with a shield covered with leather, and then\nhe came slyly and hurtled here and there, and anon with one spear he had\nsmitten down two knights of the Round Table. Then with his hurtling he\nlost the covering of his shield, then was the king and all other ware\nthat he bare a red shield. O Jesu, said King Arthur, see where rideth\na stout knight, he with the red shield. And there was noise and crying\nBeware the Knight with the Red Shield. So within a little while he had\noverthrown three brethren of Sir Gawaine's. So God me help, said King\nArthur, meseemeth yonder is the best jouster that ever I saw. With that\nhe saw him encounter with Sir Gawaine, and he smote him down with so\ngreat force that he made his horse to avoid his saddle. How now, said\nthe king, Sir Gawaine hath a fall; well were me an I knew what knight he\nwere with the red shield. I know him well, said Dinadan, but as at\nthis time ye shall not know his name. By my head, said Sir Tristram, he\njousted better than Sir Palomides, and if ye list to know his name, wit\nye well his name is Sir Lamorak de Galis.\n\nAs they stood thus talking, Sir Gawaine and he encountered together\nagain, and there he smote Sir Gawaine from his horse, and bruised him\nsore. And in the sight of King Arthur he smote down twenty knights,\nbeside Sir Gawaine and his brethren. And so clearly was the prize\ngiven him as a knight peerless. Then slyly and marvellously Sir Lamorak\nwithdrew him from all the fellowship into the forest side. All this\nespied King Arthur, for his eye went never from him. Then the king, Sir\nLauncelot, Sir Tristram, and Sir Dinadan, took their hackneys, and rode\nstraight after the good knight, Sir Lamorak de Galis, and there found\nhim. And thus said the king: Ah, fair knight, well be ye found. When he\nsaw the king he put off his helm and saluted him, and when he saw Sir\nTristram he alighted down off his horse and ran to him to take him by\nthe thighs, but Sir Tristram would not suffer him, but he alighted\nor that he came, and either took other in arms, and made great joy of\nother. The king was glad, and also was all the fellowship of the Round\nTable, except Sir Gawaine and his brethren. And when they wist that he\nwas Sir Lamorak, they had great despite at him, and were wonderly wroth\nwith him that he had put him to dishonour that day.\n\nThen Gawaine called privily in council all his brethren, and to them\nsaid thus: Fair brethren, here may ye see, whom that we hate King\nArthur loveth, and whom that we love he hateth. And wit ye well, my fair\nbrethren, that this Sir Lamorak will never love us, because we slew his\nfather, King Pellinore, for we deemed that he slew our father, King of\nOrkney. And for the despite of Pellinore, Sir Lamorak did us a shame\nto our mother, therefore I will be revenged. Sir, said Sir Gawaine's\nbrethren, let see how ye will or may be revenged, and ye shall find us\nready. Well, said Gawaine, hold you still and we shall espy our time.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. How King Arthur made King Mark to be accorded with Sir\nTristram, and how they departed toward Cornwall.\n\n\nNOW pass we our matter, and leave we Sir Gawaine, and speak of King\nArthur, that on a day said unto King Mark: Sir, I pray you give me\na gift that I shall ask you. Sir, said King Mark, I will give you\nwhatsomever ye desire an it be in my power. Sir, gramercy, said Arthur.\nThis I will ask you, that ye will be good lord unto Sir Tristram, for\nhe is a man of great honour; and that ye will take him with you into\nCornwall, and let him see his friends, and there cherish him for my\nsake. Sir, said King Mark, I promise you by the faith of my body, and\nby the faith that I owe to God and to you, I shall worship him for your\nsake in all that I can or may. Sir, said Arthur, and I will forgive you\nall the evil will that ever I ought you, an so be that you swear that\nupon a book before me. With a good will, said King Mark; and so he there\nsware upon a book afore him and all his knights, and therewith King Mark\nand Sir Tristram took either other by the hands hard knit together. But\nfor all this King Mark thought falsely, as it proved after, for he put\nSir Tristram in prison, and cowardly would have slain him.\n\nThen soon after King Mark took his leave to ride into Cornwall, and Sir\nTristram made him ready to ride with him, whereof the most part of the\nRound Table were wroth and heavy, and in especial Sir Launcelot, and Sir\nLamorak, and Sir Dinadan, were wroth out of measure For well they wist\nKing Mark would slay or destroy Sir Tristram. Alas, said Dinadan, that\nmy lord, Sir Tristram, shall depart. And Sir Tristram took such sorrow\nthat he was amazed like a fool. Alas, said Sir Launcelot unto King\nArthur, what have ye done, for ye shall lose the most man of worship\nthat ever came into your court. It was his own desire, said Arthur, and\ntherefore I might not do withal, for I have done all that I can and made\nthem at accord. Accord, said Sir Launcelot, fie upon that accord, for ye\nshall hear that he shall slay Sir Tristram, or put him in a prison, for\nhe is the most coward and the villainest king and knight that is now\nliving.\n\nAnd therewith Sir Launcelot departed, and came to King Mark, and said to\nhim thus: Sir king, wit thou well the good knight Sir Tristram shall go\nwith thee. Beware, I rede thee, of treason, for an thou mischief that\nknight by any manner of falsehood or treason, by the faith I owe to God\nand to the order of knighthood, I shall slay thee with mine own hands.\nSir Launcelot, said the king, overmuch have ye said to me, and I have\nsworn and said over largely afore King Arthur in hearing of all his\nknights, that I shall not slay nor betray him. It were to me overmuch\nshame to break my promise. Ye say well, said Sir Launcelot, but ye\nare called so false and full of treason that no man may believe you.\nForsooth it is known well wherefore ye came into this country, and for\nnone other cause but for to slay Sir Tristram. So with great dole King\nMark and Sir Tristram rode together, for it was by Sir Tristram's will\nand his means to go with King Mark, and all was for the intent to see La\nBeale Isoud, for without the sight of her Sir Tristram might not endure.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII. How Sir Percivale was made knight of King Arthur, and how\na dumb maid spake, and brought him to the Round Table.\n\n\nNOW turn we again unto Sir Lamorak, and speak we of his brethren, Sir\nTor, which was King Pellinore's first son and begotten of Aryes, wife\nof the cowherd, for he was a bastard; and Sir Aglovale was his first son\nbegotten in wedlock; Sir Lamorak, Dornar, Percivale, these were his sons\ntoo in wedlock. So when King Mark and Sir Tristram were departed from\nthe court there was made great dole and sorrow for the departing of Sir\nTristram. Then the king and his knights made no manner of joys eight\ndays after. And at the eight days' end there came to the court a knight\nwith a young squire with him. And when this knight was unarmed, he went\nto the king and required him to make the young squire a knight. Of what\nlineage is he come? said King Arthur. Sir, said the knight, he is the\nson of King Pellinore, that did you some time good service, and he is a\nbrother unto Sir Lamorak de Galis, the good knight. Well, said the king,\nfor what cause desire ye that of me that I should make him knight? Wit\nyou well, my lord the king, that this young squire is brother to me\nas well as to Sir Lamorak, and my name is Aglavale. Sir Aglavale, said\nArthur, for the love of Sir Lamorak, and for his father's love, he shall\nbe made knight to-morrow. Now tell me, said Arthur, what is his name?\nSir, said the knight, his name is Percivale de Galis. So on the morn\nthe king made him knight in Camelot. But the king and all the knights\nthought it would be long or that he proved a good knight.\n\nThen at the dinner, when the king was set at the table, and every knight\nafter he was of prowess, the king commanded him to be set among mean\nknights; and so was Sir Percivale set as the king commanded. Then was\nthere a maiden in the queen's court that was come of high blood, and she\nwas dumb and never spake word. Right so she came straight into the hall,\nand went unto Sir Percivale, and took him by the hand and said aloud,\nthat the king and all the knights might hear it: Arise, Sir Percivale,\nthe noble knight and God's knight, and go with me; and so he did. And\nthere she brought him to the right side of the Siege Perilous, and said,\nFair knight, take here thy siege, for that siege appertaineth to thee\nand to none other. Right so she departed and asked a priest. And as she\nwas confessed and houselled then she died. Then the king and all the\ncourt made great joy of Sir Percivale.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV. How Sir Lamorak visited King Lot's wife, and how Sir\nGaheris slew her which was his own mother.\n\n\nNOW turn we unto Sir Lamorak, that much was there praised. Then, by the\nmean of Sir Gawaine and his brethren, they sent for their mother there\nbesides, fast by a castle beside Camelot; and all was to that intent\nto slay Sir Lamorak. The Queen of Orkney was there but a while, but Sir\nLamorak wist of their being, and was full fain; and for to make an end\nof this matter, he sent unto her, and there betwixt them was a night\nassigned that Sir Lamorak should come to her. Thereof was ware Sir\nGaheris, and there he rode afore the same night, and waited upon Sir\nLamorak, and then he saw where he came all armed. And where Sir Lamorak\nalighted he tied his horse to a privy postern, and so he went into a\nparlour and unarmed him; and then he went unto the queen's bed, and she\nmade of him passing great joy, and he of her again, for either loved\nother passing sore. So when the knight, Sir Gaheris, saw his time, he\ncame to their bedside all armed, with his sword naked, and suddenly gat\nhis mother by the hair and struck off her head.\n\nWhen Sir Lamorak saw the blood dash upon him all hot, the which he loved\npassing well, wit you well he was sore abashed and dismayed of that\ndolorous knight. And therewithal, Sir Lamorak leapt out of the bed in\nhis shirt as a knight dismayed, saying thus: Ah, Sir Gaheris, knight\nof the Table Round, foul and evil have ye done, and to you great shame.\nAlas, why have ye slain your mother that bare you? with more right\nye should have slain me. The offence hast thou done, said Gaheris,\nnotwithstanding a man is born to offer his service; but yet shouldst\nthou beware with whom thou meddlest, for thou hast put me and my\nbrethren to a shame, and thy father slew our father; and thou to lie by\nour mother is too much shame for us to suffer. And as for thy father,\nKing Pellinore my brother Sir Gawaine and I slew him. Ye did him the\nmore wrong, said Sir Lamorak, for my father slew not your father, it\nwas Balin le Savage: and as yet my father's death is not revenged. Leave\nthose words, said Sir Gaheris, for an thou speak feloniously I will slay\nthee. But because thou art naked I am ashamed to slay thee. But wit thou\nwell, in what place I may get thee I shall slay thee; and now my mother\nis quit of thee; and withdraw thee and take thine armour, that thou were\ngone. Sir Lamorak saw there was none other bote, but fast armed him, and\ntook his horse and rode his way making great sorrow. But for the shame\nand dolour he would not ride to King Arthur's court, but rode another\nway.\n\nBut when it was known that Gaheris had slain his mother the king was\npassing wroth, and commanded him to go out of his court. Wit ye well Sir\nGawaine was wroth that Gaheris had slain his mother and let Sir Lamorak\nescape. And for this matter was the king passing wroth, and so was Sir\nLauncelot, and many other knights. Sir, said Sir Launcelot, here is a\ngreat mischief befallen by felony, and by forecast treason, that your\nsister is thus shamefully slain. And I dare say that it was wrought by\ntreason, and I dare say ye shall lose that good knight, Sir Lamorak the\nwhich is great pity. I wot well and am sure, an Sir Tristram wist it,\nhe would never more come within your court, the which should grieve you\nmuch more and all your knights. God defend, said the noble King Arthur,\nthat I should lose Sir Lamorak or Sir Tristram, for then twain of my\nchief knights of the Table Round were gone. Sir, said Sir Launcelot, I\nam sure ye shall lose Sir Lamorak, for Sir Gawaine and his brethren will\nslay him by one mean or other; for they among them have concluded and\nsworn to slay him an ever they may see their time. That shall I let,\nsaid Arthur.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV. How Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred met with a knight\nfleeing, and how they both were overthrown, and of Sir Dinadan.\n\n\nNOW leave we of Sir Lamorak, and speak of Sir Gawaine's brethren,\nand specially of Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred. As they rode on their\nadventures they met with a knight fleeing, sore wounded; and they asked\nhim what tidings. Fair knights, said he, here cometh a knight after\nme that will slay me. With that came Sir Dinadan riding to them by\nadventure, but he would promise them no help. But Sir Agravaine and\nSir Mordred promised him to rescue him. Therewithal came that knight\nstraight unto them, and anon he proffered to joust. That saw Sir Mordred\nand rode to him, but he struck Mordred over his horse's tail. That saw\nSir Agravaine, and straight he rode toward that knight, and right so as\nhe served Mordred so he served Agravaine, and said to them: Sirs, wit ye\nwell both that I am Breuse Saunce Pit\u00e9, that hath done this to you. And\nyet he rode over Agravaine five or six times. When Dinadan saw this, he\nmust needs joust with him for shame. And so Dinadan and he encountered\ntogether, that with pure strength Sir Dinadan smote him over his horse's\ntail Then he took his horse and fled, for he was on foot one of the\nvaliantest knights in Arthur's days, and a great destroyer of all good\nknights.\n\nThen rode Sir Dinadan unto Sir Mordred and unto Sir Agravaine. Sir\nknight, said they all, well have ye done, and well have ye revenged us,\nwherefore we pray you tell us your name. Fair sirs, ye ought to know my\nname, the which is called Sir Dinadan. When they understood that it was\nDinadan they were more wroth than they were before, for they hated him\nout of measure because of Sir Lamorak. For Dinadan had such a custom\nthat he loved all good knights that were valiant, and he hated all those\nthat were destroyers of good knights. And there were none that hated\nDinadan but those that ever were called murderers. Then spake the hurt\nknight that Breuse Saunce Pit\u00e9 had chased, his name was Dalan, and\nsaid: If thou be Dinadan thou slewest my father. It may well be so, said\nDinadan, but then it was in my defence and at his request. By my head,\nsaid Dalan, thou shalt die therefore, and therewith he dressed his spear\nand his shield. And to make the shorter tale, Sir Dinadan smote him down\noff his horse, that his neck was nigh broken. And in the same wise he\nsmote Sir Mordred and Sir Agravaine. And after, in the quest of the\nSangreal, cowardly and feloniously they slew Dinadan, the which was\ngreat damage, for he was a great bourder and a passing good knight.\n\nAnd so Sir Dinadan rode to a castle that hight Beale-Valet. And there he\nfound Sir Palomides that was not yet whole of the wound that Sir Lamorak\ngave him. And there Dinadan told Palomides all the tidings that he heard\nand saw of Sir Tristram, and how he was gone with King Mark, and with\nhim he hath all his will and desire. Therewith Sir Palomides waxed\nwroth, for he loved La Beale Isoud. And then he wist well that Sir\nTristram enjoyed her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI. How King Arthur, the Queen, and Launcelot received letters\nout of Cornwall, and of the answer again.\n\n\nNOW leave we Sir Palomides and Sir Dinadan in the Castle of Beale-Valet,\nand turn we again unto King Arthur. There came a knight out of Cornwall,\nhis name was Fergus, a fellow of the Round Table. And there he told\nthe king and Sir Launcelot good tidings of Sir Tristram, and there were\nbrought goodly letters, and how he left him in the castle of Tintagil.\nThen came the damosel that brought goodly letters unto King Arthur and\nunto Sir Launcelot, and there she had passing good cheer of the king,\nand of the Queen Guenever, and of Sir Launcelot. Then they wrote goodly\nletters again. But Sir Launcelot bade ever Sir Tristram beware of King\nMark, for ever he called him in his letters King Fox, as who saith, he\nfareth all with wiles and treason. Whereof Sir Tristram in his heart\nthanked Sir Launcelot. Then the damosel went unto La Beale Isoud, and\nbare her letters from the king and from Sir Launcelot, whereof she was\nin passing great joy. Fair damosel, said La Beale Isoud, how fareth\nmy Lord Arthur, and the Queen Guenever, and the noble knight, Sir\nLauncelot? She answered, and to make short tale: Much the better that\nye and Sir Tristram be in joy. God reward them, said La Beale Isoud, for\nSir Tristram suffereth great pain for me, and I for him.\n\nSo the damosel departed, and brought letters to King Mark. And when he\nhad read them, and understood them, he was wroth with Sir Tristram, for\nhe deemed that he had sent the damosel unto King Arthur. For Arthur and\nLauncelot in a manner threated King Mark. And as King Mark read these\nletters he deemed treason by Sir Tristram. Damosel, said King Mark, will\nye ride again and bear letters from me unto King Arthur? Sir, she said,\nI will be at your commandment to ride when ye will. Ye say well, said\nthe king; come again, said the king, to-morn, and fetch your letters.\nThen she departed and told them how she should ride again with letters\nunto Arthur. Then we pray you, said La Beale Isoud and Sir Tristram,\nthat when ye have received your letters, that ye would come by us that\nwe may see the privity of your letters. All that I may do, madam, ye wot\nwell I must do for Sir Tristram, for I have been long his own maiden.\n\nSo on the morn the damosel went to King Mark to have had his letters and\nto depart. I am not avised, said King Mark, as at this time to send my\nletters. Then privily and secretly he sent letters unto King Arthur, and\nunto Queen Guenever, and unto Sir Launcelot. So the varlet departed, and\nfound the king and the queen in Wales, at Carlion. And as the king and\nthe queen were at mass the varlet came with the letters. And when mass\nwas done the king and the queen opened the letters privily by themself.\nAnd the beginning of the king's letters spake wonderly short unto King\nArthur, and bade him entermete with himself and with his wife, and of\nhis knights; for he was able enough to rule and keep his wife.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII. How Sir Launcelot was wroth with the letter that he\nreceived from King Mark, and of Dinadan which made a lay of King Mark.\n\n\nWHEN King Arthur understood the letter, he mused of many things, and\nthought on his sister's words, Queen Morgan le Fay, that she had said\nbetwixt Queen Guenever and Sir Launcelot. And in this thought he studied\na great while. Then he bethought him again how his sister was his own\nenemy, and that she hated the queen and Sir Launcelot, and so he put all\nthat out of his thought. Then King Arthur read the letter again, and\nthe latter clause said that King Mark took Sir Tristram for his mortal\nenemy; wherefore he put Arthur out of doubt he would be revenged of\nSir Tristram. Then was King Arthur wroth with King Mark. And when\nQueen Guenever read her letter and understood it, she was wroth out of\nmeasure, for the letter spake shame by her and by Sir Launcelot. And\nso privily she sent the letter unto Sir Launcelot. And when he wist the\nintent of the letter he was so wroth that he laid him down on his bed to\nsleep, whereof Sir Dinadan was ware, for it was his manner to be privy\nwith all good knights. And as Sir Launcelot slept he stole the letter\nout of his hand, and read it word by word. And then he made great sorrow\nfor anger. And so Sir Launcelot awaked, and went to a window, and read\nthe letter again, the which made him angry.\n\nSir, said Dinadan, wherefore be ye angry? discover your heart to me:\nforsooth ye wot well I owe you good will, howbeit I am a poor knight\nand a servitor unto you and to all good knights. For though I be not of\nworship myself I love all those that be of worship. It is truth, said\nSir Launcelot, ye are a trusty knight, and for great trust I will shew\nyou my counsel. And when Dinadan understood all, he said: This is my\ncounsel: set you right nought by these threats, for King Mark is so\nvillainous, that by fair speech shall never man get of him. But ye shall\nsee what I shall do; I will make a lay for him, and when it is made I\nshall make an harper to sing it afore him. So anon he went and made\nit, and taught it an harper that hight Eliot. And when he could it, he\ntaught it to many harpers. And so by the will of Sir Launcelot, and of\nArthur, the harpers went straight into Wales, and into Cornwall, to sing\nthe lay that Sir Dinadan made by King Mark, the which was the worst lay\nthat ever harper sang with harp or with any other instruments.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII. How Sir Tristram was hurt, and of a war made to King\nMark; and of Sir Tristram how he promised to rescue him.\n\n\nNOW turn we again unto Sir Tristram and to King Mark. As Sir Tristram\nwas at jousts and at tournament it fortuned he was sore hurt both with\na spear and with a sword, but yet he won always the degree. And for\nto repose him he went to a good knight that dwelled in Cornwall, in a\ncastle, whose name was Sir Dinas le Seneschal. Then by misfortune there\ncame out of Sessoin a great number of men of arms, and an hideous host,\nand they entered nigh the Castle of Tintagil; and their captain's name\nwas Elias, a good man of arms. When King Mark understood his enemies\nwere entered into his land he made great dole and sorrow, for in no wise\nby his will King Mark would not send for Sir Tristram, for he hated him\ndeadly.\n\nSo when his council was come they devised and cast many perils of the\nstrength of their enemies. And then they concluded all at once, and said\nthus unto King Mark: Sir, wit ye well ye must send for Sir Tristram, the\ngood knight, or else they will never be overcome. For by Sir Tristram\nthey must be foughten withal, or else we row against the stream. Well,\nsaid King Mark, I will do by your counsel; but yet he was full loath\nthereto, but need constrained him to send for him. Then was he sent for\nin all haste that might be, that he should come to King Mark. And when\nhe understood that King Mark had sent for him, he mounted upon a soft\nambler and rode to King Mark. And when he was come the king said thus:\nFair nephew Sir Tristram, this is all. Here be come our enemies of\nSessoin, that are here nigh hand, and without tarrying they must be\nmet with shortly, or else they will destroy this country. Sir, said Sir\nTristram, wit ye well all my power is at your commandment. And wit ye\nwell, sir, these eight days I may bear none arms, for my wounds be not\nyet whole. And by that day I shall do what I may. Ye say well, said King\nMark; then go ye again and repose you and make you fresh, and I shall go\nand meet the Sessoins with all my power.\n\nSo the king departed unto Tintagil, and Sir Tristram went to repose him.\nAnd the king made a great host and departed them in three; the first\npart led Sir Dinas the Seneschal, and Sir Andred led the second part,\nand Sir Argius led the third part; and he was of the blood of King Mark.\nAnd the Sessoins had three great battles, and many good men of arms. And\nso King Mark by the advice of his knights issued out of the Castle of\nTintagil upon his enemies. And Dinas, the good knight, rode out afore,\nand slew two knights with his own hands, and then began the battles. And\nthere was marvellous breaking of spears and smiting of swords, and slew\ndown many good knights. And ever was Sir Dinas the Seneschal the best\nof King Mark's party. And thus the battle endured long with great\nmortality. But at the last King Mark and Sir Dinas, were they never so\nloath, they withdrew them to the Castle of Tintagil with great slaughter\nof people; and the Sessoins followed on fast, that ten of them were put\nwithin the gates and four slain with the portcullis.\n\nThen King Mark sent for Sir Tristram by a varlet, that told him all the\nmortality. Then he sent the varlet again, and bade him: Tell King Mark\nthat I will come as soon as I am whole, for erst I may do him no good.\nThen King Mark had his answer. Therewith came Elias and bade the king\nyield up the castle: For ye may not hold it no while. Sir Elias, said\nthe king, so will I yield up the castle if I be not soon rescued. Anon\nKing Mark sent again for rescue to Sir Tristram. By then Sir Tristram\nwas whole, and he had gotten him ten good knights of Arthur's; and with\nthem he rode unto Tintagil. And when he saw the great host of Sessoins\nhe marvelled wonder greatly. And then Sir Tristram rode by the woods and\nby the ditches as secretly as he might, till he came nigh the gates. And\nthere dressed a knight to him when he saw that Sir Tristram would enter;\nand Sir Tristram smote him down dead, and so he served three more. And\neverych of these ten knights slew a man of arms. So Sir Tristram entered\ninto the Castle of Tintagil. And when King Mark wist that Sir Tristram\nwas come he was glad of his coming, and so was all the fellowship, and\nof him they made great joy.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX. How Sir Tristram overcame the battle, and how Elias\ndesired a man to fight body for body.\n\n\nSO on the morn Elias the captain came, and bade King Mark: Come out and\ndo battle; for now the good knight Sir Tristram is entered it will\nbe shame to thee, said Elias, for to keep thy walls. When King Mark\nunderstood this he was wroth and said no word, but went unto Sir\nTristram and asked him his counsel. Sir, said Sir Tristram, will ye that\nI give him his answer? I will well, said King Mark. Then Sir Tristram\nsaid thus to the messenger: Bear thy lord word from the king and me,\nthat we will do battle with him to-morn in the plain field. What is\nyour name? said the messenger. Wit thou well my name is Sir Tristram de\nLiones. Therewithal the messenger departed and told his lord Elias all\nthat he had heard. Sir, said Sir Tristram unto King Mark, I pray you\ngive me leave to have the rule of the battle. I pray you take the rule,\nsaid King Mark. Then Sir Tristram let devise the battle in what manner\nthat it should be. He let depart his host in six parties, and ordained\nSir Dinas the Seneschal to have the foreward, and other knights to rule\nthe remnant. And the same night Sir Tristram burnt all the Sessoins'\nships unto the cold water. Anon, as Elias wist that, he said it was of\nSir Tristram's doing: For he casteth that we shall never escape,\nmother son of us. Therefore, fair fellows, fight freely to-morrow, and\nmiscomfort you nought; for any knight, though he be the best knight in\nthe world, he may not have ado with us all.\n\nThen they ordained their battle in four parties, wonderly well\napparelled and garnished with men of arms. Thus they within issued, and\nthey without set freely upon them; and there Sir Dinas did great deeds\nof arms. Not for then Sir Dinas and his fellowship were put to the\nworse. With that came Sir Tristram and slew two knights with one spear;\nthen he slew on the right hand and on the left hand, that men marvelled\nthat ever he might do such deeds of arms. And then he might see sometime\nthe battle was driven a bow-draught from the castle, and sometime it was\nat the gates of the castle. Then came Elias the captain rushing here and\nthere, and hit King Mark so sore upon the helm that he made him to\navoid the saddle. And then Sir Dinas gat King Mark again to horseback.\nTherewithal came in Sir Tristram like a lion, and there he met with\nElias, and he smote him so sore upon the helm that he avoided his\nsaddle. And thus they fought till it was night, and for great slaughter\nand for wounded people everych party drew to their rest.\n\nAnd when King Mark was come within the Castle of Tintagil he lacked of\nhis knights an hundred, and they without lacked two hundred; and they\nsearched the wounded men on both parties. And then they went to council;\nand wit you well either party were loath to fight more, so that either\nmight escape with their worship. When Elias the captain understood the\ndeath of his men he made great dole; and when he wist that they were\nloath to go to battle again he was wroth out of measure. Then Elias sent\nword unto King Mark, in great despite, whether he would find a knight\nthat would fight for him body for body. And if that he might slay King\nMark's knight, he to have the truage of Cornwall yearly. And if that his\nknight slay mine, I fully release my claim forever. Then the messenger\ndeparted unto King Mark, and told him how that his lord Elias had sent\nhim word to find a knight to do battle with him body for body. When King\nMark understood the messenger, he bade him abide and he should have his\nanswer. Then called he all the baronage together to wit what was the\nbest counsel. They said all at once: To fight in a field we have no\nlust, for had not been Sir Tristram's prowess it had been likely that we\nnever should have escaped; and therefore, sir, as we deem, it were well\ndone to find a knight that would do battle with him, for he knightly\nproffereth.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX. How Sir Elias and Sir Tristram fought together for the\ntruage, and how Sir Tristram slew Elias in the field.\n\n\nNOT for then when all this was said, they could find no knight that\nwould do battle with him. Sir king, said they all, here is no knight\nthat dare fight with Elias. Alas, said King Mark, then am I utterly\nashamed and utterly destroyed, unless that my nephew Sir Tristram will\ntake the battle upon him. Wit you well, they said all, he had yesterday\novermuch on hand, and he is weary for travail, and sore wounded. Where\nis he? said King Mark. Sir, said they, he is in his bed to repose him.\nAlas, said King Mark, but I have the succour of my nephew Sir Tristram,\nI am utterly destroyed for ever.\n\nTherewith one went to Sir Tristram where he lay, and told him what King\nMark had said. And therewith Sir Tristram arose lightly, and put on him\na long gown, and came afore the king and all the lords. And when he saw\nthem all so dismayed he asked the king and the lords what tidings were\nwith them. Never worse, said the king. And therewith he told him all,\nhow he had word of Elias to find a knight to fight for the truage of\nCornwall, and none can I find. And as for you, said the king and all the\nlords, we may ask no more of you for shame; for through your hardiness\nyesterday ye saved all our lives. Sir, said Sir Tristram, now I\nunderstand ye would have my succour, reason would that I should do all\nthat lieth in my power to do, saving my worship and my life, howbeit I\nam sore bruised and hurt. And sithen Sir Elias proffereth so largely,\nI shall fight with him, or else I will be slain in the field, or else\nI will deliver Cornwall from the old truage. And therefore lightly call\nhis messenger and he shall be answered, for as yet my wounds be green,\nand they will be sorer a seven night after than they be now; and\ntherefore he shall have his answer that I will do battle to-morn with\nhim.\n\nThen was the messenger departed brought before King Mark. Hark, my\nfellow, said Sir Tristram, go fast unto thy lord, and bid him make true\nassurance on his part for the truage, as the king here shall make on\nhis part; and then tell thy lord, Sir Elias, that I, Sir Tristram, King\nArthur's knight, and knight of the Table Round, will as to-morn meet\nwith thy lord on horseback, to do battle as long as my horse may endure,\nand after that to do battle with him on foot to the utterance. The\nmessenger beheld Sir Tristram from the top to the toe; and therewithal\nhe departed and came to his lord, and told him how he was answered of\nSir Tristram. And therewithal was made hostage on both parties, and made\nit as sure as it might be, that whether party had the victory, so to\nend. And then were both hosts assembled on both parts of the field,\nwithout the Castle of Tintagil, and there was none but Sir Tristram and\nSir Elias armed.\n\nSo when the appointment was made, they departed in-sunder, and they\ncame together with all the might that their horses might run. And either\nknight smote other so hard that both horses and knights went to the\nearth. Not for then they both lightly arose and dressed their shields\non their shoulders, with naked swords in their hands, and they dashed\ntogether that it seemed a flaming fire about them. Thus they traced, and\ntraversed, and hewed on helms and hauberks, and cut away many cantels\nof their shields, and either wounded other passing sore, so that the\nhot blood fell freshly upon the earth. And by then they had foughten the\nmountenance of an hour Sir Tristram waxed faint and for-bled, and gave\nsore aback. That saw Sir Elias, and followed fiercely upon him, and\nwounded him in many places. And ever Sir Tristram traced and traversed,\nand went froward him here and there, and covered him with his shield as\nhe might all weakly, that all men said he was overcome; for Sir Elias\nhad given him twenty strokes against one.\n\nThen was there laughing of the Sessoins' party, and great dole on King\nMark's party. Alas, said the king, we are ashamed and destroyed all for\never: for as the book saith, Sir Tristram was never so matched, but if\nit were Sir Launcelot. Thus as they stood and beheld both parties, that\none party laughing and the other party weeping, Sir Tristram remembered\nhim of his lady, La Beale Isoud, that looked upon him, and how he was\nlikely never to come in her presence. Then he pulled up his shield that\nerst hung full low. And then he dressed up his shield unto Elias, and\ngave him many sad strokes, twenty against one, and all to-brake his\nshield and his hauberk, that the hot blood ran down to the earth. Then\nbegan King Mark to laugh, and all Cornish men, and that other party to\nweep. And ever Sir Tristram said to Sir Elias: Yield thee.\n\nThen when Sir Tristram saw him so staggering on the ground, he said: Sir\nElias, I am right sorry for thee, for thou art a passing good knight as\never I met withal, except Sir Launcelot. Therewithal Sir Elias fell to\nthe earth, and there died. What shall I do, said Sir Tristram unto King\nMark, for this battle is at an end? Then they of Elias' party departed,\nand King Mark took of them many prisoners, to redress the harms and the\nscathes that he had of them; and the remnant he sent into their country\nto borrow out their fellows. Then was Sir Tristram searched and well\nhealed. Yet for all this King Mark would fain have slain Sir Tristram.\nBut for all that ever Sir Tristram saw or heard by King Mark, yet would\nhe never beware of his treason, but ever he would be thereas La Beale\nIsoud was.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI. How at a great feast that King Mark made an harper came\nand sang the lay that Dinadan had made.\n\n\nNOW will we pass of this matter, and speak we of the harpers that Sir\nLauncelot and Sir Dinadan had sent into Cornwall. And at the great\nfeast that King Mark made for joy that the Sessoins were put out of his\ncountry, then came Eliot the harper with the lay that Dinadan had made\nand secretly brought it unto Sir Tristram, and told him the lay that\nDinadan had made by King Mark. And when Sir Tristram heard it, he said:\nO Lord Jesu, that Dinadan can make wonderly well and ill, thereas it\nshall be. Sir, said Eliot, dare I sing this song afore King Mark? Yea,\non my peril, said Sir Tristram, for I shall be thy warrant. Then at the\nmeat came in Eliot the harper, and because he was a curious harper men\nheard him sing the same lay that Dinadan had made, the which spake the\nmost villainy by King Mark of his treason that ever man heard.\n\nWhen the harper had sung his song to the end King Mark was wonderly\nwroth, and said: Thou harper, how durst thou be so bold on thy head to\nsing this song afore me. Sir, said Eliot, wit you well I am a minstrel,\nand I must do as I am commanded of these lords that I bear the arms of.\nAnd sir, wit ye well that Sir Dinadan, a knight of the Table Round, made\nthis song, and made me to sing it afore you. Thou sayest well, said King\nMark, and because thou art a minstrel thou shalt go quit, but I charge\nthee hie thee fast out of my sight. So the harper departed and went to\nSir Tristram, and told him how he had sped. Then Sir Tristram let make\nletters as goodly as he could to Launcelot and to Sir Dinadan. And so he\nlet conduct the harper out of the country. But to say that King Mark was\nwonderly wroth, he was, for he deemed that the lay that was sung afore\nhim was made by Sir Tristram's counsel, wherefore he thought to slay him\nand all his well-willers in that country.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII. How King Mark slew by treason his brother Boudwin, for\ngood service that he had done to him.\n\n\nNOW turn we to another matter that fell between King Mark and his\nbrother, that was called the good Prince Boudwin, that all the people\nof the country loved passing well. So it befell on a time that the\nmiscreant Saracens landed in the country of Cornwall soon after these\nSessoins were gone. And then the good Prince Boudwin, at the landing,\nhe raised the country privily and hastily. And or it were day he let put\nwildfire in three of his own ships, and suddenly he pulled up the sail,\nand with the wind he made those ships to be driven among the navy of the\nSaracens. And to make short tale, those three ships set on fire all the\nships, that none were saved. And at point of the day the good Prince\nBoudwin with all his fellowship set on the miscreants with shouts and\ncries, and slew to the number of forty thousand, and left none alive.\n\nWhen King Mark wist this he was wonderly wroth that his brother should\nwin such worship. And because this prince was better beloved than he\nin all that country, and that also Boudwin loved well Sir Tristram,\ntherefore he thought to slay him. And thus, hastily, as a man out of\nhis wit, he sent for Prince Boudwin and Anglides his wife, and bade them\nbring their young son with them, that he might see him. All this he did\nto the intent to slay the child as well as his father, for he was the\nfalsest traitor that ever was born. Alas, for his goodness and for his\ngood deeds this gentle Prince Boudwin was slain. So when he came with\nhis wife Anglides, the king made them fair semblant till they had dined.\nAnd when they had dined King Mark sent for his brother and said thus:\nBrother, how sped you when the miscreants arrived by you? meseemeth it\nhad been your part to have sent me word, that I might have been at that\njourney, for it had been reason that I had had the honour and not you.\nSir, said the Prince Boudwin, it was so that an I had tarried till\nthat I had sent for you those miscreants had destroyed my country. Thou\nliest, false traitor, said King Mark, for thou art ever about for to\nwin worship from me, and put me to dishonour, and thou cherishest that\nI hate. And therewith he struck him to the heart with a dagger, that\nhe never after spake word. Then the Lady Anglides made great dole, and\nswooned, for she saw her lord slain afore her face. Then was there no\nmore to do but Prince Boudwin was despoiled and brought to burial. But\nAnglides privily gat her husband's doublet and his shirt, and that she\nkept secretly.\n\nThen was there much sorrow and crying, and great dole made Sir Tristram,\nSir Dinas, Sir Fergus, and so did all knights that were there; for that\nprince was passingly well beloved. So La Beale Isoud sent unto Anglides,\nthe Prince Boudwin's wife, and bade her avoid lightly or else her young\nson, Alisander le Orphelin, should be slain When she heard this, she\ntook her horse and her child; and rode with such poor men as durst ride\nwith her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII. How Anglides, Boudwin's wife, escaped with her young\nson, Alisander le Orphelin, and came to the Castle of Arundel.\n\n\nNOTWITHSTANDING, when King Mark had done this deed, yet he thought to do\nmore vengeance; and with his sword in his hand, he sought from chamber\nto chamber, to seek Anglides and her young son. And when she was missed\nhe called a good knight that hight Sadok, and charged him by pain of\ndeath to fetch Anglides again and her young son. So Sir Sadok departed\nand rode after Anglides. And within ten mile he overtook her, and bade\nher turn again and ride with him to King Mark. Alas, fair knight,\nshe said, what shall ye win by my son's death or by mine? I have had\novermuch harm and too great a loss. Madam, said Sadok, of your loss\nis dole and pity; but madam, said Sadok, would ye depart out of this\ncountry with your son, and keep him till he be of age, that he may\nrevenge his father's death, then would I suffer you to depart from me,\nso you promise me to revenge the death of Prince Boudwin. Ah, gentle\nknight, Jesu thank thee, and if ever my son, Alisander le Orphelin, live\nto be a knight, he shall have his father's doublet and his shirt with\nthe bloody marks, and I shall give him such a charge that he shall\nremember it while he liveth. And therewithal Sadok departed from her,\nand either betook other to God. And when Sadok came to King Mark he told\nhim faithfully that he had drowned young Alisander her son; and thereof\nKing Mark was full glad.\n\nNow turn we unto Anglides, that rode both night and day by adventure out\nof Cornwall, and little and in few places she rested; but ever she drew\nsouthward to the seaside, till by fortune she came to a castle that\nis called Magouns, and now it is called Arundel, in Sussex. And the\nConstable of the castle welcomed her, and said she was welcome to her\nown castle; and there was Anglides worshipfully received, for the\nConstable's wife was nigh her cousin, and the Constable's name was\nBellangere; and that same Constable told Anglides that the same castle\nwas hers by right inheritance. Thus Anglides endured years and winters,\ntill Alisander was big and strong; there was none so wight in all that\ncountry, neither there was none that might do no manner of mastery afore\nhim.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV. How Anglides gave the bloody doublet to Alisander, her\nson, the same day that he was made knight, and the charge withal.\n\n\nTHEN upon a day Bellangere the Constable came to Anglides and said:\nMadam, it were time my lord Alisander were made knight, for he is a\npassing strong young man. Sir, said she, I would he were made knight;\nbut then must I give him the most charge that ever sinful mother gave to\nher child. Do as ye list, said Bellangere, and I shall give him warning\nthat he shall be made knight. Now it will be well done that he may be\nmade knight at our Lady Day in Lent. Be it so, said Anglides, and I pray\nyou make ready therefore. So came the Constable to Alisander, and told\nhim that he should at our Lady Day in Lent be made knight. I thank God,\nsaid Alisander; these are the best tidings that ever came to me. Then\nthe Constable ordained twenty of the greatest gentlemen's sons, and the\nbest born men of the country, that should be made knights that same day\nthat Alisander was made knight. So on the same day that Alisander and\nhis twenty fellows were made knights, at the offering of the mass there\ncame Anglides unto her son and said thus: O fair sweet son, I charge\nthee upon my blessing, and of the high order of chivalry that thou\ntakest here this day, that thou understand what I shall say and charge\nthee withal. Therewithal she pulled out a bloody doublet and a bloody\nshirt, that were be-bled with old blood. When Alisander saw this he\nstert aback and waxed pale, and said: Fair mother, what may this mean?\nI shall tell thee, fair son: this was thine own father's doublet and\nshirt, that he wore upon him that same day that he was slain. And there\nshe told him why and wherefore, and how for his goodness King Mark slew\nhim with his dagger afore mine own eyen. And therefore this shall be\nyour charge that I shall give thee.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV. How it was told to King Mark of Sir Alisander, and how he\nwould have slain Sir Sadok for saving his life.\n\n\nNOW I require thee, and charge thee upon my blessing, and upon the high\norder of knighthood, that thou be revenged upon King Mark for the death\nof thy father. And therewithal she swooned. Then Alisander leapt to\nhis mother, and took her up in his arms, and said: Fair mother, ye have\ngiven me a great charge, and here I promise you I shall be avenged upon\nKing Mark when that I may; and that I promise to God and to you. So\nthis feast was ended, and the Constable, by the advice of Anglides, let\npurvey that Alisander was well horsed and harnessed. Then he jousted\nwith his twenty fellows that were made knights with him, but for to make\na short tale, he overthrew all those twenty, that none might withstand\nhim a buffet.\n\nThen one of those knights departed unto King Mark, and told him all, how\nAlisander was made knight, and all the charge that his mother gave him,\nas ye have heard afore time. Alas, false treason, said King Mark, I\nweened that young traitor had been dead. Alas, whom may I trust? And\ntherewithal King Mark took a sword in his hand; and sought Sir Sadok\nfrom chamber to chamber to slay him. When Sir Sadok saw King Mark come\nwith his sword in his hand he said thus: Beware, King Mark, and come not\nnigh me; for wit thou well that I saved Alisander his life, of which I\nnever repent me, for thou falsely and cowardly slew his father Boudwin,\ntraitorly for his good deeds; wherefore I pray Almighty Jesu send\nAlisander might and strength to be revenged upon thee. And now beware\nKing Mark of young Alisander, for he is made a knight. Alas, said King\nMark, that ever I should hear a traitor say so afore me. And therewith\nfour knights of King Mark's drew their swords to slay Sir Sadok, but\nanon Sir Sadok slew them all in King Mark's presence. And then Sir Sadok\npassed forth into his chamber, and took his horse and his harness, and\nrode on his way a good pace. For there was neither Sir Tristram, neither\nSir Dinas, nor Sir Fergus, that would Sir Sadok any evil will. Then was\nKing Mark wroth, and thought to destroy Sir Alisander and Sir Sadok that\nhad saved him; for King Mark dreaded and hated Alisander most of any man\nliving.\n\nWhen Sir Tristram understood that Alisander was made knight, anon\nforthwithal he sent him a letter, praying him and charging him that he\nwould draw him to the court of King Arthur, and that he put him in\nthe rule and in the hands of Sir Launcelot. So this letter was sent to\nAlisander from his cousin, Sir Tristram. And at that time he thought to\ndo after his commandment. Then King Mark called a knight that brought\nhim the tidings from Alisander, and bade him abide still in that\ncountry. Sir, said that knight, so must I do, for in my own country I\ndare not come. No force, said King Mark, I shall give thee here double\nas much lands as ever thou hadst of thine own. But within short space\nSir Sadok met with that false knight, and slew him. Then was King Mark\nwood wroth out of measure. Then he sent unto Queen Morgan le Fay, and\nto the Queen of North-galis, praying them in his letters that they two\nsorceresses would set all the country in fire with ladies that were\nenchantresses, and by such that were dangerous knights, as Malgrin,\nBreuse Saunce Pit\u00e9, that by no mean Alisander le Orphelin should escape,\nbut either he should be taken or slain. This ordinance made King Mark\nfor to destroy Alisander.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI. How Sir Alisander won the prize at a tournament, and of\nMorgan le Fay: and how he fought with Sir Malgrin, and slew him.\n\n\nNOW turn we again unto Sir Alisander, that at his departing his mother\ntook with him his father's bloody shirt. So that he bare with him always\ntill his death day, in tokening to think of his father's death. So was\nAlisander purposed to ride to London, by the counsel of Sir Tristram,\nto Sir Launcelot. And by fortune he went by the seaside, and rode wrong.\nAnd there he won at a tournament the gree that King Carados made. And\nthere he smote down King Carados and twenty of his knights, and also Sir\nSafere, a good knight that was Sir Palomides' brother, the good knight.\nAll this saw a damosel, and saw the best knight joust that ever she saw.\nAnd ever as he smote down knights he made them to swear to wear none\nharness in a twelvemonth and a day. This is well said, said Morgan\nle Fay, this is the knight that I would fain see. And so she took\nher palfrey, and rode a great while, and then she rested her in her\npavilion. So there came four knights, two were armed, and two were\nunarmed, and they told Morgan le Fay their names: the first was Elias\nde Gomeret, the second was Cari de Gomeret, those were armed; that other\ntwain were of Camiliard, cousins unto Queen Guenever, and that one hight\nGuy, and that other hight Garaunt, those were unarmed. There these four\nknights told Morgan le Fay how a young knight had smitten them down\nbefore a castle For the maiden of that castle said that he was but late\nmade knight, and young. But as we suppose, but if it were Sir Tristram,\nor Sir Launcelot, or Sir Lamorak, the good knight, there is none that\nmight sit him a buffet with a spear. Well, said Morgan le Fay, I shall\nmeet that knight or it be long time, an he dwell in that country.\n\nSo turn we to the damosel of the castle, that when Alisander le Orphelin\nhad forjousted the four knights, she called him to her, and said thus:\nSir knight, wilt thou for my sake joust and fight with a knight, for my\nsake, of this country, that is and hath been long time an evil neighbour\nto me? His name is Malgrin, and he will not suffer me to be married\nin no manner wise for all that I can do, or any knight for my sake.\nDamosel, said Alisander, an he come whiles I am here I will fight with\nhim, and my poor body for your sake I will jeopard. And therewithal she\nsent for him, for he was at her commandment. And when either had a sight\nof other, they made them ready for to joust, and they came together\neagerly, and Malgrin brised his spear upon Alisander, and Alisander\nsmote him again so hard that he bare him quite from his saddle to the\nearth. But this Malgrin arose lightly, and dressed his shield and drew\nhis sword, and bade him alight, saying: Though thou have the better of\nme on horseback, thou shalt find that I shall endure like a knight on\nfoot. It is well said, said Alisander; and so lightly he avoided his\nhorse and betook him to his varlet. And then they rushed together like\ntwo boars, and laid on their helms and shields long time, by the space\nof three hours, that never man could say which was the better knight.\n\nAnd in the meanwhile came Morgan le Fay to the damosel of the castle,\nand they beheld the battle. But this Malgrin was an old roted knight,\nand he was called one of the dangerous knights of the world to do battle\non foot, but on horseback there were many better. And ever this Malgrin\nawaited to slay Alisander, and so wounded him wonderly sore, that it\nwas marvel that ever he might stand, for he had bled so much blood; for\nAlisander fought wildly, and not wittily. And that other was a felonious\nknight, and awaited him, and smote him sore. And sometime they rushed\ntogether with their shields, like two boars or rams, and fell grovelling\nboth to the earth. Now knight, said Malgrin, hold thy hand a while, and\ntell me what thou art. I will not, said Alisander, but if me list: but\ntell me thy name, and why thou keepest this country, or else thou shalt\ndie of my hands. Wit thou well, said Malgrin, that for this maiden's\nlove, of this castle, I have slain ten good knights by mishap; and by\noutrage and orgulit\u00e9 of myself I have slain ten other knights. So God me\nhelp, said Alisander, this is the foulest confession that ever I heard\nknight make, nor never heard I speak of other men of such a shameful\nconfession; wherefore it were great pity and great shame unto me that\nI should let thee live any longer; therefore keep thee as well as ever\nthou mayest, for as I am true knight, either thou shalt slay me or else\nI shall slay thee, I promise thee faithfully.\n\nThen they lashed together fiercely, and at the last Alisander smote\nMalgrin to the earth. And then he raced off his helm, and smote off his\nhead lightly. And when he had done and ended this battle, anon he called\nto him his varlet, the which brought him his horse. And then he, weening\nto be strong enough, would have mounted. And so she laid Sir Alisander\nin an horse litter, and led him into the castle, for he had no foot nor\nmight to stand upon the earth; for he had sixteen great wounds, and in\nespecial one of them was like to be his death.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII. How Queen Morgan le Fay had Alisander in her castle, and\nhow she healed his wounds.\n\n\nTHEN Queen Morgan le Fay searched his wounds, and gave such an ointment\nunto him that he should have died. And on the morn when she came to him\nhe complained him sore; and then she put other ointments upon him, and\nthen he was out of his pain. Then came the damosel of the castle, and\nsaid unto Morgan le Fay: I pray you help me that this knight might wed\nme, for he hath won me with his hands. Ye shall see, said Morgan le Fay,\nwhat I shall say. Then Morgan le Fay went unto Alisander, and bade in\nanywise that he should refuse this lady, an she desire to wed you, for\nshe is not for you. So the damosel came and desired of him marriage.\nDamosel, said Orphelin, I thank you, but as yet I cast me not to marry\nin this country. Sir, she said, sithen ye will not marry me, I pray you\ninsomuch as ye have won me, that ye will give me to a knight of this\ncountry that hath been my friend, and loved me many years. With all my\nheart, said Alisander, I will assent thereto. Then was the knight sent\nfor, his name was Gerine le Grose. And anon he made them handfast, and\nwedded them.\n\nThen came Queen Morgan le Fay to Alisander, and bade him arise, and put\nhim in an horse litter, and gave him such a drink that in three days and\nthree nights he waked never, but slept; and so she brought him to her\nown castle that at that time was called La Beale Regard. Then Morgan\nle Fay came to Alisander, and asked him if he would fain be whole. Who\nwould be sick, said Alisander, an he might be whole? Well, said Morgan\nle Fay, then shall ye promise me by your knighthood that this day\ntwelvemonth and a day ye shall not pass the compass of this castle, and\nwithout doubt ye shall lightly be whole. I assent, said Sir Alisander.\nAnd there he made her a promise: then was he soon whole. And when\nAlisander was whole, then he repented him of his oath, for he might\nnot be revenged upon King Mark. Right so there came a damosel that was\ncousin to the Earl of Pase, and she was cousin to Morgan le Fay. And\nby right that castle of La Beale Regard should have been hers by\ntrue inheritance. So this damosel entered into this castle where lay\nAlisander, and there she found him upon his bed, passing heavy and all\nsad.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII. How Alisander was delivered from Queen Morgan le Fay by\nthe means of a damosel.\n\n\nSIR knight, said the damosel, an ye would be merry I could tell you good\ntidings. Well were me, said Alisander, an I might hear of good tidings,\nfor now I stand as a prisoner by my promise. Sir, she said, wit you well\nthat ye be a prisoner, and worse than ye ween; for my lady, my cousin\nQueen Morgan le Fay, keepeth you here for none other intent but for\nto do her pleasure with you when it liketh her. O Jesu defend me, said\nAlisander, from such pleasure; for I had liefer cut away my hangers than\nI would do her such pleasure. As Jesu help me, said the damosel, an ye\nwould love me and be ruled by me, I shall make your deliverance with\nyour worship. Tell me, said Alisander, by what means, and ye shall have\nmy love. Fair knight, said she, this castle of right ought to be mine,\nand I have an uncle the which is a mighty earl, he is Earl of Pase, and\nof all folks he hateth most Morgan le Fay; and I shall send unto him and\npray him for my sake to destroy this castle for the evil customs that be\nused therein; and then will he come and set wild-fire on every part of\nthe castle, and I shall get you out at a privy postern, and there\nshall ye have your horse and your harness. Ye say well, damosel, said\nAlisander. And then she said: Ye may keep the room of this castle this\ntwelvemonth and a day, then break ye not your oath. Truly, fair damosel,\nsaid Alisander, ye say sooth. And then he kissed her, and did to her\npleasaunce as it pleased them both at times and leisures.\n\nSo anon she sent unto her uncle and bade him come and destroy that\ncastle, for as the book saith, he would have destroyed that castle afore\ntime had not that damosel been. When the earl understood her letters he\nsent her word again that on such a day he would come and destroy\nthat castle. So when that day came she showed Alisander a postern\nwherethrough he should flee into a garden, and there he should find his\narmour and his horse. When the day came that was set, thither came the\nEarl of Pase with four hundred knights, and set on fire all the parts of\nthe castle, that or they ceased they left not a stone standing. And all\nthis while that the fire was in the castle he abode in the garden. And\nwhen the fire was done he let make a cry that he would keep that piece\nof earth thereas the castle of La Beale Regard was a twelvemonth and a\nday, from all manner knights that would come.\n\nSo it happed there was a duke that hight Ansirus, and he was of the kin\nof Sir Launcelot. And this knight was a great pilgrim, for every third\nyear he would be at Jerusalem. And because he used all his life to go in\npilgrimage men called him Duke Ansirus the Pilgrim. And this duke had a\ndaughter that hight Alice, that was a passing fair woman, and because of\nher father she was called Alice la Beale Pilgrim. And anon as she heard\nof this cry she went unto Arthur's court, and said openly in hearing\nof many knights, that what knight may overcome that knight that keepeth\nthat piece of earth shall have me and all my lands.\n\nWhen the knights of the Round Table heard her say thus many were glad,\nfor she was passing fair and of great rents. Right so she let cry in\ncastles and towns as fast on her side as Alisander did on his side.\nThen she dressed her pavilion straight by the piece of the earth that\nAlisander kept. So she was not so soon there but there came a knight\nof Arthur's court that hight Sagramore le Desirous, and he proffered to\njoust with Alisander; and they encountered, and Sagramore le Desirous\nbrised his spear upon Sir Alisander, but Sir Alisander smote him so hard\nthat he avoided his saddle. And when La Beale Alice saw him joust so\nwell, she thought him a passing goodly knight on horseback. And then\nshe leapt out of her pavilion, and took Sir Alisander by the bridle, and\nthus she said: Fair knight, I require thee of thy knighthood show me thy\nvisage. I dare well, said Alisander, show my visage. And then he put off\nhis helm; and she saw his visage, she said: O sweet Jesu, thee I must\nlove, and never other. Then show me your visage, said he.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX. How Alisander met with Alice la Beale Pilgrim, and how he\njousted with two knights; and after of him and of Sir Mordred.\n\n\nThen she unwimpled her visage. And when he saw her he said: Here have I\nfound my love and my lady. Truly, fair lady, said he, I promise you\nto be your knight, and none other that beareth the life. Now, gentle\nknight, said she, tell me your name. My name is, said he, Alisander le\nOrphelin. Now, damosel, tell me your name, said he. My name is, said\nshe, Alice la Beale Pilgrim. And when we be more at our heart's ease,\nboth ye and I shall tell other of what blood we be come. So there was\ngreat love betwixt them. And as they thus talked there came a knight\nthat hight Harsouse le Berbuse, and asked part of Sir Alisander's\nspears. Then Sir Alisander encountered with him, and at the first Sir\nAlisander smote him over his horse's croup. And then there came another\nknight that hight Sir Hewgon, and Sir Alisander smote him down as he\ndid that other. Then Sir Hewgon proffered to do battle on foot. Sir\nAlisander overcame him with three strokes, and there would have slain\nhim had he not yielded him. So then Alisander made both those knights to\nswear to wear none armour in a twelvemonth and a day.\n\nThen Sir Alisander alighted down, and went to rest him and repose him.\nThen the damosel that helped Sir Alisander out of the castle, in her\nplay told Alice all together how he was prisoner in the castle of La\nBeale Regard, and there she told her how she got him out of prison. Sir,\nsaid Alice la Beale Pilgrim, meseemeth ye are much beholding to this\nmaiden. That is truth, said Sir Alisander. And there Alice told him of\nwhat blood she was come. Sir, wit ye well, she said, that I am of the\nblood of King Ban, that was father unto Sir Launcelot. Y-wis, fair lady,\nsaid Alisander, my mother told me that my father was brother unto a\nking, and I nigh cousin unto Sir Tristram.\n\nThen this while came there three knights, that one hight Vains, and\nthe other hight Harvis de les Marches, and the third hight Perin de la\nMontaine. And with one spear Sir Alisander smote them down all three,\nand gave them such falls that they had no list to fight upon foot. So he\nmade them to swear to wear none arms in a twelvemonth. So when they were\ndeparted Sir Alisander beheld his lady Alice on horseback as he stood\nin her pavilion. And then was he so enamoured upon her that he wist not\nwhether he were on horseback or on foot.\n\nRight so came the false knight Sir Mordred, and saw Sir Alisander was\nassotted upon his lady; and therewithal he took his horse by the bridle,\nand led him here and there, and had cast to have led him out of that\nplace to have shamed him. When the damosel that helped him out of that\ncastle saw how shamefully he was led, anon she let arm her, and set a\nshield upon her shoulder; and therewith she mounted upon his horse, and\ngat a naked sword in her hand, and she thrust unto Alisander with all\nher might, and she gave him such a buffet that he thought the fire flew\nout of his eyen. And when Alisander felt that stroke he looked about\nhim, and drew his sword And when she saw that, she fled, and so did\nMordred into the forest, and the damosel fled into the pavilion. So when\nAlisander understood himself how the false knight would have shamed him\nhad not the damosel been then was he wroth with himself that Sir Mordred\nwas so escaped his hands. But then Sir Alisander and Alice had good game\nat the damosel, how sadly she hit him upon the helm.\n\nThen Sir Alisander jousted thus day by day, and on foot he did many\nbattles with many knights of King Arthur's court, and with many knights\nstrangers. Therefore to tell all the battles that he did it were\novermuch to rehearse, for every day within that twelvemonth he had ado\nwith one knight or with other, and some day he had ado with three or\nwith four; and there was never knight that put him to the worse. And at\nthe twelvemonth's end he departed with his lady, Alice la Beale Pilgrim.\nAnd the damosel would never go from him, and so they went into their\ncountry of Benoye, and lived there in great joy.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL. How Sir Galahalt did do cry a jousts in Surluse, and Queen\nGuenever's knights should joust against all that would come.\n\n\nBUT as the book saith, King Mark would never stint till he had slain him\nby treason. And by Alice he gat a child that hight Bellengerus le Beuse.\nAnd by good fortune he came to the court of King Arthur, and proved a\npassing good knight; and he revenged his father's death, for the false\nKing Mark slew both Sir Tristram and Alisander falsely and feloniously.\nAnd it happed so that Alisander had never grace nor fortune to come to\nKing Arthur's court. For an he had come to Sir Launcelot, all knights\nsaid that knew him, he was one of the strongest knights that was in\nArthur's days, and great dole was made for him. So let we of him pass,\nand turn we to another tale.\n\nSo it befell that Sir Galahalt, the haut prince, was lord of the country\nof Surluse, whereof came many good knights. And this noble prince was a\npassing good man of arms, and ever he held a noble fellowship together.\nAnd then he came to Arthur's court and told him his intent, how this was\nhis will, how he would let cry a jousts in the country of Surluse, the\nwhich country was within the lands of King Arthur, and there he asked\nleave to let cry a jousts. I will give you leave, said King Arthur; but\nwit thou well, said King Arthur, I may not be there. Sir, said Queen\nGuenever, please it you to give me leave to be at that jousts. With\nright good will, said Arthur; for Sir Galahalt, the haut prince, shall\nhave you in governance. Sir, said Galahalt, I will as ye will. Sir,\nthen the queen, I will take with me [Sir Launcelot] and such knights as\nplease me best. Do as ye list, said King Arthur. So anon she commanded\nSir Launcelot to make him ready with such knights as he thought best.\n\nSo in every good town and castle of this land was made a cry, that in\nthe country of Surluse Sir Galahalt should make a joust that should last\neight days, and how the haut prince, with the help of Queen Guenever's\nknights, should joust against all manner of men that would come. When\nthis cry was known, kings and princes, dukes and earls, barons and\nnoble knights, made them ready to be at that jousts. And at the day of\njousting there came in Sir Dinadan disguised, and did many great deeds\nof arms.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI. How Sir Launcelot fought in the tournament, and how Sir\nPalomides did arms there for a damosel.\n\n\nTHEN at the request of Queen Guenever and of King Bagdemagus Sir\nLauncelot came into the range, but he was disguised, and that was the\ncause that few folk knew him; and there met with him Sir Ector de Maris,\nhis own brother, and either brake their spears upon other to their\nhands. And then either gat another spear. And then Sir Launcelot smote\ndown Sir Ector de Maris, his own brother. That saw Sir Bleoberis, and\nhe smote Sir Launcelot such a buffet upon the helm that he wist not well\nwhere he was. Then Sir Launcelot was wrothy and smote Sir Bleoberis so\nsore upon the helm that his head bowed down backward. And he smote\neft another buffet, that he avoided his saddle; and so he rode by, and\nthrust forth to the thickest. When the King of Northgalis saw Sir Ector\nand Bleoberis lie on the ground then was he wroth, for they came on\nhis party against them of Surluse. So the King of Northgalis ran to\nSir Launcelot, and brake a spear upon him all to pieces. Therewith Sir\nLauncelot overtook the King of Northgalis, and smote him such a buffet\non the helm with his sword that he made him to avoid his horse; and anon\nthe king was horsed again. So both the King Bagdemagus' and the King of\nNorth-galis' party hurled to other; and then began a strong medley, but\nthey of Northgalis were far bigger.\n\nWhen Sir Launcelot saw his party go to the worst he thrang into the\nthickest press with a sword in his hand; and there he smote down on the\nright hand and on the left hand, and pulled down knights and raced off\ntheir helms, that all men had wonder that ever one knight might do such\ndeeds of arms. When Sir Meliagaunce, that was son unto King Bagdemagus,\nsaw how Sir Launcelot fared he marvelled greatly. And when he understood\nthat it was he, he wist well that he was disguised for his sake. Then\nSir Meliagaunce prayed a knight to slay Sir Launcelot's horse, either\nwith sword or with spear. At that time King Bagdemagus met with a knight\nthat hight Sauseise, a good knight, to whom he said: Now fair Sauseise,\nencounter with my son Meliagaunce and give him large payment, for I\nwould he were well beaten of thy hands, that he might depart out of\nthis field. And then Sir Sauseise encountered with Sir Meliagaunce,\nand either smote other down. And then they fought on foot, and there\nSauseise had won Sir Meliagaunce, had there not come rescues. So then\nthe haut prince blew to lodging, and every knight unarmed him and went\nto the great feast.\n\nThen in the meanwhile there came a damosel to the haut prince, and\ncomplained that there was a knight that hight Goneries that withheld her\nall her lands. Then the knight was there present, and cast his glove to\nher or to any that would fight in her name. So the damosel took up the\nglove all heavily for default of a champion. Then there came a varlet to\nher and said: Damosel, will ye do after me? Full fain, said the damosel.\nThen go you unto such a knight that lieth here beside in an hermitage,\nand that followeth the Questing Beast, and pray him to take the battle\nupon him, and anon I wot well he will grant you.\n\nSo anon she took her palfrey, and within a while she found that knight,\nthat was Sir Palomides. And when she required him he armed him and rode\nwith her, and made her to go to the haut prince, and to ask leave for\nher knight to do battle. I will well, said the haut prince. Then the\nknights were ready in the field to joust on horseback; and either gat a\nspear in their hands, and met so fiercely together that their spears\nall to-shivered. Then they flang out swords, and Sir Palomides smote Sir\nGoneries down to the earth. And then he raced off his helm and smote off\nhis head. Then they went to supper, and the damosel loved Palomides\nas paramour, but the book saith she was of his kin. So then Palomides\ndisguised himself in this manner, in his shield he bare the Questing\nBeast, and in all his trappings. And when he was thus ready, he sent to\nthe haut prince to give him leave to joust with other knights, but he\nwas adoubted of Sir Launcelot. The haut prince sent him word again that\nhe should be welcome, and that Sir Launcelot should not joust with him.\nThen Sir Galahalt, the haut prince, let cry what knight somever he were\nthat smote down Sir Palomides should have his damosel to himself.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII. How Sir Galahalt and Palomides fought together, and of Sir\nDinadan and Sir Galahalt.\n\n\nHERE beginneth the second day. Anon as Sir Palomides came into the\nfield, Sir Galahalt, the haut prince, was at the range end, and met with\nSir Palomides, and he with him, with great spears. And then they came so\nhard together that their spears all to-shivered, but Sir Galahalt smote\nhim so hard that he bare him backward over his horse, but yet he lost\nnot his stirrups. Then they drew their swords and lashed together many\nsad strokes, that many worshipful knights left their business to behold\nthem. But at the last Sir Galahalt, the haut prince, smote a stroke of\nmight unto Palomides, sore upon the helm; but the helm was so hard that\nthe sword might not bite, but slipped and smote off the head of the\nhorse of Sir Palomides. When the haut prince wist and saw the good\nknight fall unto the earth he was ashamed of that stroke. And therewith\nhe alighted down off his own horse, and prayed the good knight,\nPalomides, to take that horse of his gift, and to forgive him that deed.\nSir, said Palomides, I thank you of your great goodness, for ever of a\nman of worship a knight shall never have disworship; and so he mounted\nupon that horse, and the haut prince had another anon. Now, said the\nhaut prince, I release to you that maiden, for ye have won her. Ah, said\nPalomides, the damosel and I be at your commandment.\n\nSo they departed, and Sir Galahalt did great deeds of arms. And right so\ncame Dinadan and encountered with Sir Galahalt, and either came to other\nso fast with their spears that their spears brake to their hands. But\nDinadan had weened the haut prince had been more weary than he was. And\nthen he smote many sad strokes at the haut prince; but when Dinadan saw\nhe might not get him to the earth he said: My lord, I pray you leave me,\nand take another. The haut prince knew not Dinadan, and left goodly for\nhis fair words. And so they departed; but soon there came another and\ntold the haut prince that it was Dinadan. Forsooth, said the prince,\ntherefore am I heavy that he is so escaped from me, for with his mocks\nand japes now shall I never have done with him. And then Galahalt rode\nfast after him, and bade him: Abide, Dinadan, for King Arthur's sake.\nNay, said Dinadan, so God me help, we meet no more together this day.\nThen in that wrath the haut prince met with Meliagaunce, and he smote\nhim in the throat that an he had fallen his neck had broken; and with\nthe same spear he smote down another knight. Then came in they of\nNorthgalis and many strangers, and were like to have put them of Surluse\nto the worse, for Sir Galahalt, the haut prince, had ever much in hand.\nSo there came the good knight, Semound the Valiant, with forty knights,\nand he beat them all aback. Then the Queen Guenever and Sir Launcelot\nlet blow to lodging, and every knight unarmed him, and dressed him to\nthe feast.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII. How Sir Archade appealed Sir Palomides of treason, and\nhow Sir Palomides slew him.\n\n\nWHEN Palomides was unarmed he asked lodging for himself and the damosel.\nAnon the haut prince commanded them to lodging. And he was not so\nsoon in his lodging but there came a knight that hight Archade, he\nwas brother unto Goneries that Palomides slew afore in the damosel's\nquarrel. And this knight, Archade, called Sir Palomides traitor, and\nappealed him for the death of his brother. By the leave of the\nhaut prince, said Palomides, I shall answer thee. When Sir Galahalt\nunderstood their quarrel he bade them go to dinner: And as soon as ye\nhave dined look that either knight be ready in the field. So when they\nhad dined they were armed both, and took their horses, and the queen,\nand the prince, and Sir Launcelot, were set to behold them; and so they\nlet run their horses, and there Sir Palomides bare Archade on his spear\nover his horse's tail. And then Palomides alighted and drew his sword,\nbut Sir Archade might not arise; and there Sir Palomides raced off his\nhelm, and smote off his head. Then the haut prince and Queen Guenever\nwent unto supper. Then King Bagdemagus sent away his son Meliagaunce\nbecause Sir Launcelot should not meet with him, for he hated Sir\nLauncelot, and that knew he not.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV. Of the third day, and how Sir Palomides jousted with Sir\nLamorak, and other things.\n\n\nNOW beginneth the third day of jousting; and at that day King Bagdemagus\nmade him ready; and there came against him King Marsil, that had in gift\nan island of Sir Galahalt the haut prince; and this island had the\nname Pomitain. Then it befell that King Bagdemagus and King Marsil of\nPomitain met together with spears, and King Marsil had such a buffet\nthat he fell over his horse's croup. Then came there in a knight of King\nMarsil to revenge his lord, and King Bagdemagus smote him down, horse\nand man, to the earth. So there came an earl that hight Arrouse, and Sir\nBreuse, and an hundred knights with them of Pomitain, and the King of\nNorthgalis was with them; and all these were against them of Surluse.\nAnd then there began great battle, and many knights were cast under\nhorses' feet. And ever King Bagdemagus did best, for he first began, and\never he held on. Gaheris, Gawaine's brother, smote ever at the face of\nKing Bagdemagus; and at the last King Bagdemagus hurtled down Gaheris,\nhorse and man.\n\nThen by adventure Sir Palomides, the good knight, met with Sir Blamore\nde Ganis, Sir Bleoberis' brother. And either smote other with great\nspears, that both their horses and knights fell to the earth. But Sir\nBlamore had such a fall that he had almost broken his neck, for the\nblood brast out at nose, mouth, and his ears, but at the last he\nrecovered well by good surgeons. Then there came in the Duke Chaleins of\nClarance; and in his governance there came a knight that hight Elis la\nNoire; and there encountered with him King Bagdemagus, and he smote Elis\nthat he made him to avoid his saddle. So the Duke Chaleins of Clarance\ndid there great deeds of arms, and of so late as he came in the\nthird day there was no man did so well except King Bagdemagus and Sir\nPalomides, that the prize was given that day to King Bagdemagus. And\nthen they blew unto lodging, and unarmed them, and went to the feast.\nRight so came Dinadan, and mocked and japed with King Bagdemagus that\nall knights laughed at him, for he was a fine japer, and well loving all\ngood knights.\n\nSo anon as they had dined there came a varlet bearing four spears on his\nback; and he came to Palomides, and said thus: Here is a knight by hath\nsent you the choice of four spears, and requireth you for your lady's\nsake to take that one half of these spears, and joust with him in the\nfield. Tell him, said Palomides, I will not fail him. When Sir Galahalt\nwist of this, he bade Palomides make him ready. So the Queen Guenever,\nthe haut prince, and Sir Launcelot, they were set upon scaffolds to give\nthe judgment of these two knights. Then Sir Palomides and the strange\nknight ran so eagerly together that their spears brake to their hands.\nAnon withal either of them took a great spear in his hand and all\nto-shivered them in pieces. And then either took a greater spear, and\nthen the knight smote down Sir Palomides, horse and man, to the earth.\nAnd as he would have passed over him the strange knight's horse stumbled\nand fell down upon Palomides. Then they drew their swords and lashed\ntogether wonderly sore a great while.\n\nThen the haut prince and Sir Launcelot said they saw never two knights\nfight better than they did; but ever the strange knight doubled his\nstrokes, and put Palomides aback; therewithal the haut prince cried: Ho:\nand then they went to lodging. And when they were unarmed they knew it\nwas the noble knight Sir Lamorak. When Sir Launcelot knew that it was\nSir Lamorak he made much of him, for above all earthly men he loved him\nbest except Sir Tristram. Then Queen Guenever commended him, and so did\nall other good knights make much of him, except Sir Gawaine's brethren.\nThen Queen Guenever said unto Sir Launcelot: Sir, I require you that\nan ye joust any more, that ye joust with none of the blood of my lord\nArthur. So he promised he would not as at that time.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV. Of the fourth day, and of many great feats of arms.\n\n\nHERE beginneth the fourth day. Then came into the field the King with\nthe Hundred Knights, and all they of Northgalis, and the Duke Chaleins\nof Clarance, and King Marsil of Pomitain, and there came Safere,\nPalomides' brother, and there he told him tidings of his mother. And his\nname was called the Earl, and so he appealed him afore King Arthur: For\nhe made war upon our father and mother, and there I slew him in plain\nbattle. So they went into the field, and the damosel with them; and\nthere came to encounter again them Sir Bleoberis de Ganis, and Sir Ector\nde Maris. Sir Palomides encountered with Sir Bleoberis, and either smote\nother down. And in the same wise did Sir Safere and Sir Ector, and\nthe two couples did battle on foot. Then came in Sir Lamorak, and he\nencountered with the King with the Hundred Knights, and smote him\nquite over his horse's tail. And in the same wise he served the King of\nNorthgalis, and also he smote down King Marsil. And so or ever he stint\nhe smote down with his spear and with his sword thirty knights. When\nDuke Chaleins saw Lamorak do so great prowess he would not meddle with\nhim for shame; and then he charged all his knights in pain of death that\nnone of you touch him; for it were shame to all good knights an that\nknight were shamed.\n\nThen the two kings gathered them together, and all they set upon Sir\nLamorak; and he failed them not, but rushed here and there, smiting on\nthe right hand and on the left, and raced off many helms, so that the\nhaut prince and Queen Guenever said they saw never knight do such deeds\nof arms on horseback. Alas, said Launcelot to King Bagdemagus, I\nwill arm me and help Sir Lamorak. And I will ride with you, said King\nBagdemagus. And when they two were horsed they came to Sir Lamorak that\nstood among thirty knights; and well was him that might reach him a\nbuffet, and ever he smote again mightily. Then came there into the press\nSir Launcelot, and he threw down Sir Mador de la Porte. And with the\ntruncheon of that spear he threw down many knights. And King Bagdemagus\nsmote on the left hand and on the right hand marvellously well. And then\nthe three kings fled aback. Therewithal then Sir Galahalt let blow to\nlodging, and all the heralds gave Sir Lamorak the prize. And all this\nwhile fought Palomides, Sir Bleoberis, Sir Safere, Sir Ector on foot;\nnever were there four knights evener matched. And then they were\ndeparted, and had unto their lodging, and unarmed them, and so they went\nto the great feast.\n\nBut when Sir Lamorak was come into the court Queen Guenever took him in\nher arms and said: Sir, well have ye done this day. Then came the haut\nprince, and he made of him great joy, and so did Dinadan, for he wept\nfor joy; but the joy that Sir Launcelot made of Sir Lamorak there might\nno man tell. Then they went unto rest, and on the morn the haut prince\nlet blow unto the field.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI. Of the Fifth day, and how Sir Lamorak behaved him.\n\n\nHERE beginneth the fifth day. So it befell that Sir Palomides came in\nthe morntide, and proffered to joust thereas King Arthur was in a castle\nthere besides Surluse; and there encountered with him a worshipful duke,\nand there Sir Palomides smote him over his horse's croup. And this duke\nwas uncle unto King Arthur. Then Sir Elise's son rode unto Palomides,\nand Palomides served Elise in the same wise. When Sir Uwaine saw this\nhe was wroth. Then he took his horse and encountered with Sir Palomides,\nand Palomides smote him so hard that he went to the earth, horse and\nman. And for to make a short tale, he smote down three brethren of Sir\nGawaine, that is for to say Mordred, Gaheris, and Agravaine. O Jesu,\nsaid Arthur, this is a great despite of a Saracen that he shall smite\ndown my blood. And therewithal King Arthur was wood wroth, and thought\nto have made him ready to joust.\n\nThat espied Sir Lamorak, that Arthur and his blood were discomfit; and\nanon he was ready, and asked Palomides if he would any more joust. Why\nshould I not? said Palomides. Then they hurtled together, and brake\ntheir spears, and all to-shivered them, that all the castle rang of\ntheir dints. Then either gat a greater spear in his hand, and they came\nso fiercely together; but Sir Palomides' spear all to-brast and Sir\nLamorak's did hold. Therewithal Sir Palomides lost his stirrups and lay\nupright on his horse's back. And then Sir Palomides returned again and\ntook his damosel, and Sir Safere returned his way.\n\nSo, when he was departed, King Arthur came to Sir Lamorak and thanked\nhim of his goodness, and prayed him to tell him his name. Sir, said\nLamorak, wit thou well, I owe you my service, but as at this time I\nwill not abide here, for I see of mine enemies many about me. Alas, said\nArthur, now wot I well it is Sir Lamorak de Galis. O Lamorak, abide\nwith me, and by my crown I shall never fail thee: and not so hardy in\nGawaine's head, nor none of his brethren, to do thee any wrong. Sir,\nsaid Sir Lamorak, wrong have they done me, and to you both. That is\ntruth, said the king, for they slew their own mother and my sister, the\nwhich me sore grieveth: it had been much fairer and better that ye had\nwedded her, for ye are a king's son as well as they. O Jesu, said the\nnoble knight Sir Lamorak unto Arthur, her death shall I never forget. I\npromise you, and make mine avow unto God, I shall revenge her death as\nsoon as I see time convenable. And if it were not at the reverence of\nyour highness I should now have been revenged upon Sir Gawaine and\nhis brethren. Truly, said Arthur, I will make you at accord. Sir, said\nLamorak, as at this time I may not abide with you, for I must to the\njousts, where is Sir Launcelot, and the haut prince Sir Galahalt.\n\nThen there was a damosel that was daughter to King Bandes. And there was\na Saracen knight that hight Corsabrin, and he loved the damosel, and\nin no wise he would suffer her to be married; for ever this Corsabrin\nnoised her, and named her that she was out of her mind; and thus he let\nher that she might not be married.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII. How Sir Palomides fought with Corsabrin for a lady, and\nhow Palomides slew Corsabrin.\n\n\nSO by fortune this damosel heard tell that Palomides did much for\ndamosels' sake; so she sent to him a pensel, and prayed him to fight\nwith Sir Corsabrin for her love, and he should have her and her lands\nof her father's that should fall to her. Then the damosel sent unto\nCorsabrin, and bade him go unto Sir Palomides that was a paynim as well\nas he, and she gave him warning that she had sent him her pensel, and\nif he might overcome Palomides she would wed him. When Corsabrin wist of\nher deeds then was he wood wroth and angry, and rode unto Surluse where\nthe haut prince was, and there he found Sir Palomides ready, the which\nhad the pensel. So there they waged battle either with other afore\nGalahalt. Well, said the haut prince, this day must noble knights joust,\nand at-after dinner we shall see how ye can speed.\n\nThen they blew to jousts; and in came Dinadan, and met with Sir Gerin,\na good knight, and he threw him down over his horse's croup; and Sir\nDinadan overthrew four knights more; and there he did great deeds of\narms, for he was a good knight, but he was a scoffer and a japer, and\nthe merriest knight among fellowship that was that time living. And he\nhad such a custom that he loved every good knight, and every good knight\nloved him again. So then when the haut prince saw Dinadan do so well, he\nsent unto Sir Launcelot and bade him strike down Sir Dinadan: And when\nthat ye have done so bring him afore me and the noble Queen Guenever.\nThen Sir Launcelot did as he was required. Then Sir Lamorak and he smote\ndown many knights, and raced off helms, and drove all the knights afore\nthem. And so Sir Launcelot smote down Sir Dinadan, and made his men to\nunarm him, and so brought him to the queen and the haut prince, and they\nlaughed at Dinadan so sore that they might not stand. Well, said Sir\nDinadan, yet have I no shame, for the old shrew, Sir Launcelot, smote\nme down. So they went to dinner, [and] all the court had good sport at\nDinadan.\n\nThen when the dinner was done they blew to the field to behold Sir\nPalomides and Corsabrin. Sir Palomides pight his pensel in midst of\nthe field; and then they hurtled together with their spears as it were\nthunder, and either smote other to the earth. And then they pulled out\ntheir swords, and dressed their shields, and lashed together mightily as\nmighty knights, that well-nigh there was no piece of harness would hold\nthem, for this Corsabrin was a passing felonious knight. Corsabrin, said\nPalomides, wilt thou release me yonder damosel and the pensel? Then was\nCorsabrin wroth out of measure, and gave Palomides such a buffet that\nhe kneeled on his knee. Then Palomides arose lightly, and smote him upon\nthe helm that he fell down right to the earth. And therewith he raced\noff his helm and said: Corsabrin, yield thee or else thou shalt die of\nmy hands. Fie on thee, said Corsabrin, do thy worst. Then he smote\noff his head. And therewithal came a stink of his body when the soul\ndeparted, that there might nobody abide the savour. So was the corpse\nhad away and buried in a wood, because he was a paynim. Then they blew\nunto lodging, and Palomides was unarmed.\n\nThen he went unto Queen Guenever, to the haut prince, and to Sir\nLauncelot. Sir, said the haut prince, here have ye seen this day a great\nmiracle by Corsabrin, what savour there was when the soul departed from\nthe body. Therefore, sir, we will require you to take the baptism upon\nyou, and I promise you all knights will set the more by you, and say\nmore worship by you. Sir, said Palomides, I will that ye all know that\ninto this land I came to be christened, and in my heart I am christened\nand christened will I be. But I have made such an avow that I may not be\nchristened till I have done seven true battles for Jesu's sake, and then\nwill I be christened; and I trust God will take mine intent, for I mean\ntruly Then Sir Palomides prayed Queen Guenever and the haut prince to\nsup with him. And so they did, both Sir Launcelot and Sir Lamorak, and\nmany other good knights. So on the morn they heard their mass, and blew\nthe field, and then knights made them ready.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII. Of the sixth day, and what then was done.\n\n\nHERE beginneth the sixth day. Then came therein Sir Gaheris, and there\nencountered with him Sir Ossaise of Surluse, and Sir Gaheris smote him\nover his horse's croup. And then either party encountered with other,\nand there were many spears broken, and many knights cast under feet. So\nthere came in Sir Dornard and Sir Aglovale, that were brethren unto Sir\nLamorak, and they met with other two knights, and either smote other\nso hard that all four knights and horses fell to the earth. When Sir\nLamorak saw his two brethren down he was wroth out of measure, and then\nhe gat a great spear in his hand, and therewithal he smote down four\ngood knights, and then his spear brake. Then he pulled out his sword,\nand smote about him on the right hand and on the left hand, and raced\noff helms and pulled down knights, that all men marvelled of such deeds\nof arms as he did, for he fared so that many knights fled. Then he\nhorsed his brethren again, and said: Brethren, ye ought to be ashamed to\nfall so off your horses! what is a knight but when he is on horseback? I\nset not by a knight when he is on foot, for all battles on foot are but\npillers' battles. For there should no knight fight on foot but if it\nwere for treason, or else he were driven thereto by force; therefore,\nbrethren, sit fast on your horses, or else fight never more afore me.\n\nWith that came in the Duke Chaleins of Clarance, and there encountered\nwith him the Earl Ulbawes of Surluse, and either of them smote other\ndown. Then the knights of both parties horsed their lords again, for Sir\nEctor and Bleoberis were on foot, waiting on the Duke Chaleins. And the\nKing with the Hundred Knights was with the Earl of Ulbawes. With that\ncame Gaheris and lashed to the King with the Hundred Knights, and he to\nhim again. Then came the Duke Chaleins and departed them.\n\nThen they blew to lodging, and the knights unarmed them and drew them to\ntheir dinner; and at the midst of their dinner in came Dinadan and began\nto rail. Then he beheld the haut prince, that seemed wroth with some\nfault that he saw; for he had a custom he loved no fish, and because he\nwas served with fish, the which he hated, therefore he was not merry.\nWhen Sir Dinadan had espied the haut prince, he espied where was a fish\nwith a great head, and that he gat betwixt two dishes, and served the\nhaut prince with that fish. And then he said thus: Sir Galahalt, well\nmay I liken you to a wolf, for he will never eat fish, but flesh;\nthen the haut prince laughed at his words. Well, well, said Dinadan\nto Launcelot, what devil do ye in this country, for here may no mean\nknights win no worship for thee. Sir Dinadan, said Launcelot, I ensure\nthee I shall no more meet with thee nor with thy great spear, for I may\nnot sit in my saddle when that spear hitteth me. And if I be happy\nI shall beware of that boistous body that thou bearest. Well, said\nLauncelot, make good watch ever: God forbid that ever we meet but if it\nbe at a dish of meat. Then laughed the queen and the haut prince, that\nthey might not sit at their table; thus they made great joy till on the\nmorn, and then they heard mass, and blew to field. And Queen Guenever\nand all the estates were set, and judges armed clean with their shields\nto keep the right.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX. Of the seventh battle, and how Sir Launcelot, being\ndisguised like a maid, smote down Sir Dinadan.\n\n\nNOW beginneth the seventh battle. There came in the Duke Cambines,\nand there encountered with him Sir Aristance, that was counted a good\nknight, and they met so hard that either bare other down, horse and man.\nThen came there the Earl of Lambaile and helped the duke again to horse.\nThen came there Sir Ossaise of Surluse, and he smote the Earl Lambaile\ndown from his horse. Then began they to do great deeds of arms, and many\nspears were broken, and many knights were cast to the earth. Then the\nKing of Northgalis and the Earl Ulbawes smote together that all the\njudges thought it was like mortal death. This meanwhile Queen Guenever,\nand the haut prince, and Sir Launcelot, made there Sir Dinadan make him\nready to joust. I would, said Dinadan, ride into the field, but then one\nof you twain will meet with me. Per dieu, said the haut prince, ye may\nsee how we sit here as judges with our shields, and always mayest thou\nbehold whether we sit here or not.\n\nSo Sir Dinadan departed and took his horse, and met with many knights,\nand did passing well. And as he was departed, Sir Launcelot disguised\nhimself, and put upon his armour a maiden's garment freshly attired.\nThen Sir Launcelot made Sir Galihodin to lead him through the range, and\nall men had wonder what damosel it was. And so as Sir Dinadan came\ninto the range, Sir Launcelot, that was in the damosel's array, gat\nGalihodin's spear, and ran unto Sir Dinadan. And always Sir Dinadan\nlooked up thereas Sir Launcelot was, and then he saw one sit in the\nstead of Sir Launcelot, armed. But when Dinadan saw a manner of a\ndamosel he dread perils that it was Sir Launcelot disguised, but Sir\nLauncelot came on him so fast that he smote him over his horse's croup;\nand then with great scorns they gat Sir Dinadan into the forest there\nbeside, and there they dispoiled him unto his shirt, and put upon him\na woman's garment, and so brought him into the field: and so they blew\nunto lodging. And every knight went and unarmed them. Then was Sir\nDinadan brought in among them all. And when Queen Guenever saw Sir\nDinadan brought so among them all, then she laughed that she fell down,\nand so did all that there were. Well, said Dinadan to Launcelot, thou\nart so false that I can never beware of thee. Then by all the assent\nthey gave Sir Launcelot the prize, the next was Sir Lamorak de Galis,\nthe third was Sir Palomides, the fourth was King Bagdemagus; so these\nfour knights had the prize, and there was great joy, and great nobley in\nall the court.\n\nAnd on the morn Queen Guenever and Sir Launcelot departed unto King\nArthur, but in no wise Sir Lamorak would not go with them. I shall\nundertake, said Sir Launcelot, that an ye will go with us King Arthur\nshall charge Sir Gawaine and his brethren never to do you hurt. As for\nthat, said Sir Lamorak, I will not trust Sir Gawaine nor none of his\nbrethren; and wit ye well, Sir Launcelot, an it were not for my lord\nKing Arthur's sake, I should match Sir Gawaine and his brethren well\nenough. But to say that I should trust them, that shall I never, and\ntherefore I pray you recommend me unto my lord Arthur, and unto all my\nlords of the Round Table. And in what place that ever I come I shall do\nyou service to my power: and sir, it is but late that I revenged that,\nwhen my lord Arthur's kin were put to the worse by Sir Palomides.\nThen Sir Lamorak departed from Sir Launcelot, and either wept at their\ndeparting.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L. How by treason Sir Tristram was brought to a tournament for\nto have been slain, and how he was put in prison.\n\n\nNOW turn we from this matter, and speak we of Sir Tristram, of whom\nthis book is principally of, and leave we the king and the queen, Sir\nLauncelot, and Sir Lamorak, and here beginneth the treason of King Mark,\nthat he ordained against Sir Tristram. There was cried by the coasts of\nCornwall a great tournament and jousts, and all was done by Sir Galahalt\nthe haut prince and King Bagdemagus, to the intent to slay Launcelot, or\nelse utterly destroy him and shame him, because Sir Launcelot had always\nthe higher degree, therefore this prince and this king made this jousts\nagainst Sir Launcelot. And thus their counsel was discovered unto King\nMark, whereof he was full glad.\n\nThen King Mark bethought him that he would have Sir Tristram unto that\ntournament disguised that no man should know him, to that intent that\nthe haut prince should ween that Sir Tristram were Sir Launcelot. So at\nthese jousts came in Sir Tristram. And at that time Sir Launcelot was\nnot there, but when they saw a knight disguised do such deeds of arms,\nthey weened it had been Sir Launcelot. And in especial King Mark said it\nwas Sir Launcelot plainly. Then they set upon him, both King Bagdemagus,\nand the haut prince, and their knights, that it was wonder that ever Sir\nTristram might endure that pain. Notwithstanding for all the pain that\nhe had, Sir Tristram won the degree at that tournament, and there he\nhurt many knights and bruised them, and they hurt him and bruised him\nwonderly sore. So when the jousts were all done they knew well that it\nwas Sir Tristram de Liones; and all that were on King Mark's party were\nglad that Sir Tristram was hurt, and the remnant were sorry of his hurt;\nfor Sir Tristram was not so behated as was Sir Launcelot within the\nrealm of England.\n\nThen came King Mark unto Sir Tristram and said: Fair nephew, I am sorry\nof your hurts. Gramercy my lord, said Sir Tristram. Then King Mark made\nSir Tristram to be put in an horse bier in great sign of love, and said:\nFair cousin, I shall be your leech myself. And so he rode forth with Sir\nTristram, and brought him to a castle by daylight. And then King Mark\nmade Sir Tristram to eat. And then after he gave him a drink, the which\nas soon as he had drunk he fell asleep. And when it was night he made\nhim to be carried to another castle, and there he put him in a strong\nprison, and there he ordained a man and a woman to give him his meat and\ndrink. So there he was a great while.\n\nThen was Sir Tristram missed, and no creature wist where he was become.\nWhen La Beale Isoud heard how he was missed, privily she went unto Sir\nSadok, and prayed him to espy where was Sir Tristram. Then when Sadok\nwist how Sir Tristram was missed, and anon espied that he was put in\nprison by King Mark and the traitors of Magouns, then Sadok and two of\nhis cousins laid them in an ambushment, fast by the Castle of Tintagil,\nin arms. And as by fortune, there came riding King Mark and four of his\nnephews, and a certain of the traitors of Magouns. When Sir Sadok espied\nthem he brake out of the bushment, and set there upon them. And when\nKing Mark espied Sir Sadok he fled as fast as he might, and there Sir\nSadok slew all the four nephews unto King Mark. But these traitors of\nMagouns slew one of Sadok's cousins with a great wound in the neck, but\nSadok smote the other to the death. Then Sir Sadok rode upon his way\nunto a castle that was called Liones, and there he espied of the treason\nand felony of King Mark. So they of that castle rode with Sir Sadok till\nthat they came to a castle that hight Arbray, and there in the town\nthey found Sir Dinas the Seneschal, that was a good knight. But when Sir\nSadok had told Sir Dinas of all the treason of King Mark he defied such\na king, and said he would give up his lands that he held of him. And\nwhen he said these words all manner knights said as Sir Dinas said. Then\nby his advice and of Sir Sadok's, he let stuff all the towns and castles\nwithin the country of Liones, and assembled all the people that they\nmight make.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI. How King Mark let do counterfeit letters from the Pope, and\nhow Sir Percivale delivered Sir Tristram out of prison.\n\n\nNOW turn we unto King Mark, that when he was escaped from Sir Sadok he\nrode unto the Castle of Tintagil, and there he made great cry and noise,\nand cried unto harness all that might bear arms. Then they sought and\nfound where were dead four cousins of King Mark's, and the traitor of\nMagouns. Then the king let inter them in a chapel. Then the king let cry\nin all the country that held of him, to go unto arms, for he understood\nto the war he must needs. When King Mark heard and understood how Sir\nSadok and Sir Dinas were arisen in the country of Liones he remembered\nof wiles and treason. Lo thus he did: he let make and counterfeit\nletters from the Pope, and did make a strange clerk to bear them unto\nKing Mark; the which letters specified that King Mark should make him\nready, upon pain of cursing, with his host to come to the Pope, to help\nto go to Jerusalem, for to make war upon the Saracens.\n\nWhen this clerk was come by the mean of the king, anon withal King Mark\nsent these letters unto Sir Tristram and bade him say thus: that an he\nwould go war upon the miscreants, he should be had out of prison, and\nto have all his power. When Sir Tristram understood this letter, then\nhe said thus to the clerk: Ah, King Mark, ever hast thou been a traitor,\nand ever will be; but, Clerk, said Sir Tristram, say thou thus unto\nKing Mark: Since the Apostle Pope hath sent for him, bid him go thither\nhimself; for tell him, traitor king as he is, I will not go at his\ncommandment, get I out of prison as I may, for I see I am well rewarded\nfor my true service. Then the clerk returned unto King Mark, and told\nhim of the answer of Sir Tristram. Well, said King Mark, yet shall he be\nbeguiled. So he went into his chamber, and counterfeit letters; and the\nletters specified that the Pope desired Sir Tristram to come himself,\nto make war upon the miscreants. When the clerk was come again to Sir\nTristram and took him these letters, then Sir Tristram beheld these\nletters, and anon espied they were of King Mark's counterfeiting. Ah,\nsaid Sir Tristram, false hast thou been ever, King Mark, and so wilt\nthou end. Then the clerk departed from Sir Tristram and came to King\nMark again.\n\nBy then there were come four wounded knights within the Castle of\nTintagil, and one of them his neck was nigh broken in twain. Another\nhad his arm stricken away, the third was borne through with a spear, the\nfourth had his teeth stricken in twain. And when they came afore King\nMark they cried and said: King, why fleest thou not, for all this\ncountry is arisen clearly against thee? Then was King Mark wroth out of\nmeasure.\n\nAnd in the meanwhile there came into the country Sir Percivale de Galis\nto seek Sir Tristram. And when he heard that Sir Tristram was in prison,\nSir Percivale made clearly the deliverance of Sir Tristram by his\nknightly means. And when he was so delivered he made great joy of\nSir Percivale, and so each one of other. Sir Tristram said unto Sir\nPercivale: An ye will abide in these marches I will ride with you. Nay,\nsaid Percivale, in this country I may not tarry, for I must needs into\nWales. So Sir Percivale departed from Sir Tristram, and rode straight\nunto King Mark, and told him how he had delivered Sir Tristram; and also\nhe told the king that he had done himself great shame for to put Sir\nTristram in prison, for he is now the knight of most renown in this\nworld living. And wit thou well the noblest knights of the world love\nSir Tristram, and if he will make war upon you ye may not abide it. That\nis truth, said King Mark, but I may not love Sir Tristram because he\nloveth my queen and my wife, La Beale Isoud. Ah, fie for shame, said Sir\nPercivale, say ye never so more. Are ye not uncle unto Sir Tristram,\nand he your nephew? Ye should never think that so noble a knight as Sir\nTristram is, that he would do himself so great a villainy to hold\nhis uncle's wife; howbeit, said Sir Percivale, he may love your queen\nsinless, because she is called one of the fairest ladies of the world.\n\nThen Sir Percivale departed from King Mark. So when he was departed King\nMark bethought him of more treason: notwithstanding King Mark granted\nSir Percivale never by no manner of means to hurt Sir Tristram. So anon\nKing Mark sent unto Sir Dinas the Seneschal that he should put down all\nthe people that he had raised, for he sent him an oath that he would go\nhimself unto the Pope of Rome to war upon the miscreants; and this is\na fairer war than thus to arise the people against your king. When Sir\nDinas understood that King Mark would go upon the miscreants, then Sir\nDinas in all the haste put down all the people; and when the people\nwere departed every man to his home, then King Mark espied where was Sir\nTristram with La Beale Isoud; and there by treason King Mark let take\nhim and put him in prison, contrary to his promise that he made unto Sir\nPercivale.\n\nWhen Queen Isoud understood that Sir Tristram was in prison she made as\ngreat sorrow as ever made lady or gentlewoman. Then Sir Tristram sent a\nletter unto La Beale Isoud, and prayed her to be his good lady; and if\nit pleased her to make a vessel ready for her and him, he would go with\nher unto the realm of Logris, that is this land. When La Beale Isoud\nunderstood Sir Tristram's letters and his intent, she sent him another,\nand bade him be of good comfort, for she would do make the vessel ready,\nand all thing to purpose.\n\nThen La Beale Isoud sent unto Sir Dinas, and to Sadok, and prayed them\nin anywise to take King Mark, and put him in prison, unto the time that\nshe and Sir Tristram were departed unto the realm of Logris. When Sir\nDinas the Seneschal understood the treason of King Mark he promised her\nagain, and sent her word that King Mark should be put in prison. And as\nthey devised it so it was done. And then Sir Tristram was delivered out\nof prison; and anon in all the haste Queen Isoud and Sir Tristram went\nand took their counsel with that they would have with them when they\ndeparted.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII. How Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud came unto England, and\nhow Sir Launcelot brought them to Joyous Gard.\n\n\nTHEN La Beale Isoud and Sir Tristram took their vessel, and came by\nwater into this land. And so they were not in this land four days but\nthere came a cry of a jousts and tournament that King Arthur let make.\nWhen Sir Tristram heard tell of that tournament he disguised himself,\nand La Beale Isoud, and rode unto that tournament. And when he came\nthere he saw many knights joust and tourney; and so Sir Tristram dressed\nhim to the range, and to make short conclusion, he overthrew fourteen\nknights of the Round Table. When Sir Launcelot saw these knights thus\noverthrown, Sir Launcelot dressed him to Sir Tristram. That saw La Beale\nIsoud how Sir Launcelot was come into the field. Then La Beale Isoud\nsent unto Sir Launcelot a ring, and bade him wit that it was Sir\nTristram de Liones. When Sir Launcelot under stood that there was Sir\nTristram he was full glad, and would not joust. Then Sir Launcelot\nespied whither Sir Tristram yede, and after him he rode; and then either\nmade of other great joy. And so Sir Launcelot brought Sir Tristram and\nLa Beale Isoud unto Joyous Gard, that was his own castle, that he had\nwon with his own hands. And there Sir Launcelot put them in to wield for\ntheir own. And wit ye well that castle was garnished and furnished for\na king and a queen royal there to have sojourned. And Sir Launcelot\ncharged all his people to honour them and love them as they would do\nhimself.\n\nSo Sir Launcelot departed unto King Arthur; and then he told Queen\nGuenever how he that jousted so well at the last tournament was Sir\nTristram. And there he told her how he had with him La Beale Isoud\nmaugre King Mark, and so Queen Guenever told all this unto King Arthur.\nWhen King Arthur wist that Sir Tristram was escaped and come from King\nMark, and had brought La Beale Isoud with him, then was he passing glad.\nSo because of Sir Tristram King Arthur let make a cry, that on May Day\nshould be a jousts before the castle of Lonazep; and that castle was\nfast by Joyous Gard. And thus Arthur devised, that all the knights of\nthis land, and of Cornwall, and of North Wales, should joust against all\nthese countries, Ireland, Scotland, and the remnant of Wales, and\nthe country of Gore, and Surluse, and of Listinoise, and they of\nNorthumberland, and all they that held lands of Arthur on this half the\nsea. When this cry was made many knights were glad and many were unglad.\nSir, said Launcelot unto Arthur, by this cry that ye have made ye will\nput us that be about you in great jeopardy, for there be many knights\nthat have great envy to us; therefore when we shall meet at the day of\njousts there will be hard shift among us. As for that, said Arthur, I\ncare not; there shall we prove who shall be best of his hands. So when\nSir Launcelot understood wherefore King Arthur made this jousting, then\nhe made such purveyance that La Beale Isoud should behold the jousts in\na secret place that was honest for her estate.\n\nNow turn we unto Sir Tristram and to La Beale Isoud, how they made great\njoy daily together with all manner of mirths that they could devise;\nand every day Sir Tristram would go ride a-hunting, for Sir Tristram was\nthat time called the best chaser of the world, and the noblest blower of\nan horn of all manner of measures; for as books report, of Sir Tristram\ncame all the good terms of venery and hunting, and all the sizes and\nmeasures of blowing of an horn; and of him we had first all the terms of\nhawking, and which were beasts of chase and beasts of venery, and which\nwere vermins, and all the blasts that long to all manner of games. First\nto the uncoupling, to the seeking, to the rechate, to the flight, to the\ndeath, and to strake, and many other blasts and terms, that all manner\nof gentlemen have cause to the world's end to praise Sir Tristram, and\nto pray for his soul.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII. How by the counsel of La Beale Isoud Sir Tristram rode\narmed, and how he met with Sir Palomides.\n\n\nSO on a day La Beale Isoud said unto Sir Tristram: I marvel me much,\nsaid she, that ye remember not yourself, how ye be here in a strange\ncountry, and here be many perilous knights; and well ye wot that King\nMark is full of treason; and that ye will ride thus to chase and to\nhunt unarmed ye might be destroyed. My fair lady and my love, I cry you\nmercy, I will no more do so. So then Sir Tristram rode daily a-hunting\narmed, and his men bearing his shield and his spear. So on a day a\nlittle afore the month of May, Sir Tristram chased an hart passing\neagerly, and so the hart passed by a fair well. And then Sir Tristram\nalighted and put off his helm to drink of that bubbly water. Right so he\nheard and saw the Questing Beast come to the well. When Sir Tristram\nsaw that beast he put on his helm, for he deemed he should hear of Sir\nPalomides, for that beast was his quest. Right so Sir Tristram saw where\ncame a knight armed, upon a noble courser, and he saluted him, and they\nspake of many things; and this knight's name was Breuse Saunce Pit\u00e9. And\nright so withal there came unto them the noble knight Sir Palomides, and\neither saluted other, and spake fair to other.\n\nFair knights, said Sir Palomides, I can tell you tidings. What is that?\nsaid those knights. Sirs, wit ye well that King Mark is put in prison by\nhis own knights, and all was for love of Sir Tristram; for King Mark had\nput Sir Tristram twice in prison, and once Sir Percivale delivered the\nnoble knight Sir Tristram out of prison. And at the last time Queen\nLa Beale Isoud delivered him, and went clearly away with him into this\nrealm; and all this while King Mark, the false traitor, is in prison. Is\nthis truth? said Palomides; then shall we hastily hear of Sir Tristram.\nAnd as for to say that I love La Beale Isoud paramours, I dare make\ngood that I do, and that she hath my service above all other ladies, and\nshall have the term of my life.\n\nAnd right so as they stood talking they saw afore them where came a\nknight all armed, on a great horse, and one of his men bare his shield,\nand the other his spear. And anon as that knight espied them he gat his\nshield and his spear and dressed him to joust. Fair fellows, said Sir\nTristram, yonder is a knight will joust with us, let see which of us\nshall encounter with him, for I see well he is of the court of King\nArthur. It shall not be long or he be met withal, said Sir Palomides,\nfor I found never no knight in my quest of this glasting beast, but an\nhe would joust I never refused him. As well may I, said Breuse Saunce\nPit\u00e9, follow that beast as ye. Then shall ye do battle with me, said\nPalomides.\n\nSo Sir Palomides dressed him unto that other knight, Sir Bleoberis, that\nwas a full noble knight, nigh kin unto Sir Launcelot. And so they met\nso hard that Sir Palomides fell to the earth, horse and all. Then Sir\nBleoberis cried aloud and said thus: Make thee ready thou false traitor\nknight, Breuse Saunce Pit\u00e9, for wit thou certainly I will have ado with\nthee to the utterance for the noble knights and ladies that thou hast\nfalsely betrayed. When this false knight and traitor, Breuse Saunce\nPit\u00e9, heard him say so, he took his horse by the bridle and fled his way\nas fast as ever his horse might run, for sore he was of him afeard. When\nSir Bleoberis saw him flee he followed fast after, through thick and\nthrough thin. And by fortune as Sir Breuse fled, he saw even afore him\nthree knights of the Table Round, of the which the one hight Sir Ector\nde Maris, the other hight Sir Percivale de Galis, the third hight\nSir Harry le Fise Lake, a good knight and an hardy. And as for Sir\nPercivale, he was called that time of his time one of the best knights\nof the world, and the best assured. When Breuse saw these knights he\nrode straight unto them, and cried unto them and prayed them of rescues.\nWhat need have ye? said Sir Ector. Ah, fair knights, said Sir Breuse,\nhere followeth me the most traitor knight, and most coward, and most of\nvillainy; his name is Breuse Saunce Pit\u00e9, and if he may get me he will\nslay me without mercy and pity. Abide with us, said Sir Percivale, and\nwe shall warrant you.\n\nThen were they ware of Sir Bleoberis that came riding all that he might.\nThen Sir Ector put himself forth to joust afore them all. When Sir\nBleoberis saw that they were four knights and he but himself, he stood\nin a doubt whether he would turn or hold his way. Then he said to\nhimself: I am a knight of the Table Round, and rather than I should\nshame mine oath and my blood I will hold my way whatsoever fall thereof.\nAnd then Sir Ector dressed his spear, and smote either other passing\nsore, but Sir Ector fell to the earth. That saw Sir Percivale, and he\ndressed his horse toward him all that he might drive, but Sir Percivale\nhad such a stroke that horse and man fell to the earth. When Sir Harry\nsaw that they were both to the earth then he said to himself: Never was\nBreuse of such prowess. So Sir Harry dressed his horse, and they met\ntogether so strongly that both the horses and knights fell to the earth,\nbut Sir Bleoberis' horse began to recover again. That saw Breuse and he\ncame hurtling, and smote him over and over, and would have slain him\nas he lay on the ground. Then Sir Harry le Fise Lake arose lightly, and\ntook the bridle of Sir Breuse's horse, and said: Fie for shame! strike\nnever a knight when he is at the earth, for this knight may be called no\nshameful knight of his deeds, for yet as men may see thereas he lieth on\nthe ground he hath done worshipfully, and put to the worse passing\ngood knights. Therefore will I not let, said Sir Breuse. Thou shalt not\nchoose, said Sir Harry, as at this time. Then when Sir Breuse saw that\nhe might not choose nor have his will he spake fair. Then Sir Harry let\nhim go. And then anon he made his horse to run over Sir Bleoberis, and\nrashed him to the earth like if he would have slain him. When Sir Harry\nsaw him do so villainously he cried: Traitor knight, leave off for\nshame. And as Sir Harry would have taken his horse to fight with Sir\nBreuse, then Sir Breuse ran upon him as he was half upon his horse,\nand smote him down, horse and man, to the earth, and had near slain\nSir Harry, the good knight. That saw Sir Percivale, and then he cried:\nTraitor knight what dost thou? And when Sir Percivale was upon his\nhorse Sir Breuse took his horse and fled all that ever he might, and\nSir Percivale and Sir Harry followed after him fast, but ever the longer\nthey chased the farther were they behind.\n\nThen they turned again and came to Sir Ector de Maris and to Sir\nBleoberis. Ah, fair knights, said Bleoberis, why have ye succoured that\nfalse knight and traitor? Why said Sir Harry, what knight is he? for\nwell I wot it is a false knight, said Sir Harry, and a coward and a\nfelonious knight. Sir, said Bleoberis, he is the most coward knight, and\na devourer of ladies and a destroyer of good knights and especially of\nArthur's. What is your name? said Sir Ector. My name is Sir Bleoberis de\nGanis. Alas, fair cousin, said Ector, forgive it me, for I am Sir Ector\nde Maris. Then Sir Percivale and Sir Harry made great joy that they\nmet with Bleoberis, but all they were heavy that Sir Breuse was escaped\nthem, whereof they made great dole.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV. Of Sir Palomides, and how he met with Sir Bleoberis and\nwith Sir Ector, and of Sir Pervivale.\n\n\nRIGHT so as they stood thus there came Sir Palomides, and when he saw\nthe shield of Bleoberis lie on the earth, then said Palomides: He that\noweth that shield let him dress him to me, for he smote me down here\nfast by at a fountain, and therefore I will fight for him on foot. I\nam ready, said Bleoberis, here to answer thee, for wit thou well, sir\nknight, it was I, and my name is Bleoberis de Ganis. Well art thou met,\nsaid Palomides, and wit thou well my name is Palomides the Saracen; and\neither of them hated other to the death. Sir Palomides, said Ector, wit\nthou well there is neither thou nor none knight that beareth the life\nthat slayeth any of our blood but he shall die for it; therefore an thou\nlist to fight go seek Sir Launcelot or Sir Tristram, and there shall ye\nfind your match. With them have I met, said Palomides, but I had never\nno worship of them. Was there never no manner of knight, said Sir Ector,\nbut they that ever matched with you? Yes, said Palomides, there was the\nthird, a good knight as any of them, and of his age he was the best that\never I found; for an he might have lived till he had been an hardier man\nthere liveth no knight now such, and his name was Sir Lamorak de Galis.\nAnd as he had jousted at a tournament there he overthrew me and thirty\nknights more, and there he won the degree. And at his departing there\nmet him Sir Gawaine and his brethren, and with great pain they slew him\nfeloniously, unto all good knights' great damage. Anon as Sir Percivale\nheard that his brother was dead, Sir Lamorak, he fell over his horse's\nmane swooning, and there he made the greatest dole that ever made\nknight. And when Sir Percivale arose he said: Alas, my good and noble\nbrother Sir Lamorak, now shall we never meet, and I trow in all the wide\nworld a man may not find such a knight as he was of his age; and it is\ntoo much to suffer the death of our father King Pellinore, and now the\ndeath of our good brother Sir Lamorak.\n\nThen in the meanwhile there came a varlet from the court of King Arthur,\nand told them of the great tournament that should be at Lonazep, and how\nthese lands, Cornwall and Northgalis, should be against all them that\nwould come.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV. How Sir Tristram met with Sir Dinadan, and of their devices,\nand what he said to Sir Gawaine's brethren.\n\n\nNOW turn we unto Sir Tristram, that as he rode a-hunting he met with Sir\nDinadan, that was come into that country to seek Sir Tristram. Then Sir\nDinadan told Sir Tristram his name, but Sir Tristram would not tell him\nhis name, wherefore Sir Dinadan was wroth. For such a foolish knight as\nye are, said Sir Dinadan, I saw but late this day lying by a well, and\nhe fared as he slept; and there he lay like a fool grinning, and would\nnot speak, and his shield lay by him, and his horse stood by him; and\nwell I wot he was a lover. Ah, fair sir, said Sir Tristram are ye not\na lover? Mary, fie on that craft! said Sir Dinadan. That is evil said,\nsaid Sir Tristram, for a knight may never be of prowess but if he be a\nlover. It is well said, said Sir Dinadan; now tell me your name, sith\nye be a lover, or else I shall do battle with you. As for that, said Sir\nTristram, it is no reason to fight with me but I tell you my name; and\nas for that my name shall ye not wit as at this time. Fie for shame,\nsaid Dinadan, art thou a knight and durst not tell thy name to me?\ntherefore I will fight with thee. As for that, said Sir Tristram, I will\nbe advised, for I will not do battle but if me list. And if I do battle,\nsaid Sir Tristram, ye are not able to withstand me. Fie on thee, coward,\nsaid Sir Dinadan.\n\nAnd thus as they hoved still, they saw a knight come riding against\nthem. Lo, said Sir Tristram, see where cometh a knight riding, will\njoust with you. Anon, as Sir Dinadan beheld him he said: That is the\nsame doted knight that I saw lie by the well, neither sleeping nor\nwaking. Well, said Sir Tristram, I know that knight well with the\ncovered shield of azure, he is the king's son of Northumberland, his\nname is Epinegris; and he is as great a lover as I know, and he loveth\nthe king's daughter of Wales, a full fair lady. And now I suppose, said\nSir Tristram, an ye require him he will joust with you, and then shall\nye prove whether a lover be a better knight, or ye that will not love\nno lady. Well, said Dinadan, now shalt thou see what I shall do.\nTherewithal Sir Dinadan spake on high and said: Sir knight, make thee\nready to joust with me, for it is the custom of errant knights one to\njoust with other. Sir, said Epinegris, is that the rule of you errant\nknights for to make a knight to joust, will he or nill? As for that,\nsaid Dinadan, make thee ready, for here is for me. And therewithal they\nspurred their horses and met together so hard that Epinegris smote down\nSir Dinadan. Then Sir Tristram rode to Sir Dinadan and said: How now,\nmeseemeth the lover hath well sped. Fie on thee, coward, said Sir\nDinadan, and if thou be a good knight revenge me. Nay, said Sir\nTristram, I will not joust as at this time, but take your horse and let\nus go hence. God defend me, said Sir Dinadan, from thy fellowship, for I\nnever sped well since I met with thee: and so they departed. Well, said\nSir Tristram, peradventure I could tell you tidings of Sir Tristram.\nGod defend me, said Dinadan, from thy fellowship, for Sir Tristram were\nmickle the worse an he were in thy company; and then they departed.\nSir, said Sir Tristram, yet it may happen I shall meet with you in other\nplaces.\n\nSo rode Sir Tristram unto Joyous Gard, and there he heard in that town\ngreat noise and cry. What is this noise? said Sir Tristram. Sir, said\nthey, here is a knight of this castle that hath been long among us, and\nright now he is slain with two knights, and for none other cause but\nthat our knight said that Sir Launcelot were a better knight than Sir\nGawaine. That was a simple cause, said Sir Tristram, for to slay a good\nknight for to say well by his master. That is little remedy to us, said\nthe men of the town. For an Sir Launcelot had been here soon we should\nhave been revenged upon the false knights.\n\nWhen Sir Tristram heard them say so he sent for his shield and for his\nspear, and lightly within a while he had overtaken them, and bade them\nturn and amend that they had misdone. What amends wouldst thou have?\nsaid the one knight. And therewith they took their course, and either\nmet other so hard that Sir Tristram smote down that knight over his\nhorse's tail. Then the other knight dressed him to Sir Tristram, and in\nthe same wise he served the other knight. And then they gat off their\nhorses as well as they might, and dressed their shields and swords to do\ntheir battle to the utterance. Knights, said Sir Tristram, ye shall tell\nme of whence ye are, and what be your names, for such men ye might be ye\nshould hard escape my hands; and ye might be such men of such a country\nthat for all your evil deeds ye should pass quit. Wit thou well, sir\nknight, said they, we fear not to tell thee our names, for my name is\nSir Agravaine, and my name is Gaheris, brethren unto the good knight Sir\nGawaine, and we be nephews unto King Arthur. Well, said Sir Tristram,\nfor King Arthur's sake I shall let you pass as at this time. But it is\nshame, said Sir Tristram, that Sir Gawaine and ye be come of so great a\nblood that ye four brethren are so named as ye be, for ye be called the\ngreatest destroyers and murderers of good knights that be now in this\nrealm; for it is but as I heard say that Sir Gawaine and ye slew among\nyou a better knight than ever ye were, that was the noble knight Sir\nLamorak de Galis. An it had pleased God, said Sir Tristram, I would I\nhad been by Sir Lamorak at his death. Then shouldst thou have gone the\nsame way, said Sir Gaheris. Fair knight, said Sir Tristram, there must\nhave been many more knights than ye are. And therewithal Sir Tristram\ndeparted from them toward Joyous Gard. And when he was departed they\ntook their horses, and the one said to the other: We will overtake him\nand be revenged upon him in the despite of Sir Lamorak.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI. How Sir Tristram smote down Sir Agravaine and Sir Gaheris,\nand how Sir Dinadan was sent for by La Beale Isoud.\n\n\nSO when they had overtaken Sir Tristram, Sir Agravaine bade him: Turn,\ntraitor knight. That is evil said, said Sir Tristram; and therewith he\npulled out his sword, and smote Sir Agravaine such a buffet upon\nthe helm that he tumbled down off his horse in a swoon, and he had a\ngrievous wound. And then he turned to Gaheris, and Sir Tristram smote\nhis sword and his helm together with such a might that Gaheris fell out\nof his saddle: and so Sir Tristram rode unto Joyous Gard, and there he\nalighted and unarmed him. So Sir Tristram told La Beale Isoud of all his\nadventure, as ye have heard to-fore. And when she heard him tell of Sir\nDinadan: Sir, said she, is not that he that made the song by King Mark?\nThat same is he, said Sir Tristram, for he is the best bourder and\njaper, and a noble knight of his hands, and the best fellow that I\nknow, and all good knights love his fellowship. Alas, sir, said she, why\nbrought ye not him with you? Have ye no care, said Sir Tristram, for he\nrideth to seek me in this country; and therefore he will not away till\nhe have met with me. And there Sir Tristram told La Beale Isoud how Sir\nDinadan held against all lovers. Right so there came in a varlet and\ntold Sir Tristram how there was come an errant knight into the town,\nwith such colours upon his shield. That is Sir Dinadan, said Sir\nTristram; wit ye what ye shall do, said Sir Tristram: send ye for him,\nmy Lady Isoud, and I will not be seen, and ye shall hear the merriest\nknight that ever ye spake withal, and the maddest talker; and I pray you\nheartily that ye make him good cheer.\n\nThen anon La Beale Isoud sent into the town, and prayed Sir Dinadan that\nhe would come into the castle and repose him there with a lady. With a\ngood will, said Sir Dinadan; and so he mounted upon his horse and rode\ninto the castle; and there he alighted, and was unarmed, and brought\ninto the castle. Anon La Beale Isoud came unto him, and either saluted\nother; then she asked him of whence that he was. Madam, said Dinadan,\nI am of the court of King Arthur, and knight of the Table Round, and my\nname is Sir Dinadan. What do ye in this country? said La Beale Isoud.\nMadam, said he, I seek Sir Tristram the good knight, for it was told me\nthat he was in this country. It may well be, said La Beale Isoud, but I\nam not ware of him. Madam, said Dinadan, I marvel of Sir Tristram and\nmo other lovers, what aileth them to be so mad and so sotted upon women.\nWhy, said La Beale Isoud, are ye a knight and be no lover? it is shame\nto you: wherefore ye may not be called a good knight [but] if ye make a\nquarrel for a lady. God defend me, said Dinadan, for the joy of love is\ntoo short, and the sorrow thereof, and what cometh thereof, dureth over\nlong. Ah, said La Beale Isoud, say ye not so, for here fast by was the\ngood knight Sir Bleoberis, that fought with three knights at once for a\ndamosel's sake, and he won her afore the King of Northumberland. It was\nso, said Sir Dinadan, for I know him well for a good knight and a noble,\nand come of noble blood; for all be noble knights of whom he is come of,\nthat is Sir Launcelot du Lake.\n\nNow I pray you, said La Beale Isoud, tell me will you fight for my\nlove with three knights that do me great wrong? and insomuch as ye be\na knight of King Arthur's I require you to do battle for me. Then Sir\nDinadan said: I shall say you ye be as fair a lady as ever I saw any,\nand much fairer than is my lady Queen Guenever, but wit ye well at one\nword, I will not fight for you with three knights, Jesu defend me. Then\nIsoud laughed, and had good game at him. So he had all the cheer that\nshe might make him, and there he lay all that night. And on the morn\nearly Sir Tristram armed him, and La Beale Isoud gave him a good helm;\nand then he promised her that he would meet with Sir Dinadan, and they\ntwo would ride together into Lonazep, where the tournament should be:\nAnd there shall I make ready for you where ye shall see the tournament.\nThen departed Sir Tristram with two squires that bare his shield and his\nspears that were great and long.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII. How Sir Dinadan met with Sir Tristram, and with jousting\nwith Sir Palomides, Sir Dinadan knew him.\n\n\nTHEN after that Sir Dinadan departed, and rode his way a great pace\nuntil he had overtaken Sir Tristram. And when Sir Dinadan had overtaken\nhim he knew him anon, and he hated the fellowship of him above all other\nknights. Ah, said Sir Dinadan, art thou that coward knight that I met\nwith yesterday? keep thee, for thou shalt joust with me maugre thy head.\nWell, said Sir Tristram, and I am loath to joust. And so they let their\nhorses run, and Sir Tristram missed of him a-purpose, and Sir Dinadan\nbrake a spear upon Sir Tristram, and therewith Sir Dinadan dressed him\nto draw out his sword. Not so, said Sir Tristram, why are ye so wroth?\nI will not fight. Fie on thee, coward, said Dinadan, thou shamest all\nknights. As for that, said Sir Tristram, I care not, for I will wait\nupon you and be under your protection; for because ye are so good a\nknight ye may save me. The devil deliver me of thee, said Sir Dinadan,\nfor thou art as goodly a man of arms and of thy person as ever I saw,\nand the most coward that ever I saw. What wilt thou do with those\ngreat spears that thou carriest with thee? I shall give them, said Sir\nTristram, to some good knight when I come to the tournament; and if I\nsee you do best, I shall give them to you.\n\nSo thus as they rode talking they saw where came an errant knight afore\nthem, that dressed him to joust. Lo, said Sir Tristram, yonder is one\nwill joust; now dress thee to him. Ah, shame betide thee, said Sir\nDinadan. Nay, not so, said Tristram, for that knight beseemeth a shrew.\nThen shall I, said Sir Dinadan. And so they dressed their shields and\ntheir spears, and they met together so hard that the other knight smote\ndown Sir Dinadan from his horse. Lo, said Sir Tristram, it had been\nbetter ye had left. Fie on thee, coward, said Sir Dinadan. Then Sir\nDinadan started up and gat his sword in his hand, and proffered to do\nbattle on foot. Whether in love or in wrath? said the other knight. Let\nus do battle in love, said Sir Dinadan. What is your name, said that\nknight, I pray you tell me. Wit ye well my name is Sir Dinadan. Ah,\nDinadan, said that knight, and my name is Gareth, the youngest brother\nunto Sir Gawaine. Then either made of other great cheer, for this Gareth\nwas the best knight of all the brethren, and he proved a good knight.\nThen they took their horses, and there they spake of Sir Tristram, how\nsuch a coward he was; and every word Sir Tristram heard and laughed them\nto scorn.\n\nThen were they ware where came a knight afore them well horsed and well\narmed, and he made him ready to joust. Fair knights, said Sir Tristram,\nlook betwixt you who shall joust with yonder knight, for I warn you I\nwill not have ado with him. Then shall I, said Sir Gareth. And so they\nencountered together, and there that knight smote down Sir Gareth over\nhis horse's croup. How now, said Sir Tristram unto Sir Dinadan, dress\nthee now and revenge the good knight Gareth. That shall I not, said Sir\nDinadan, for he hath stricken down a much bigger knight than I am.\nAh, said Sir Tristram, now Sir Dinadan, I see and feel well your heart\nfaileth you, therefore now shall ye see what I shall do. And then Sir\nTristram hurtled unto that knight, and smote him quite from his horse.\nAnd when Sir Dinadan saw that, he marvelled greatly; and then he deemed\nthat it was Sir Tristram.\n\nThen this knight that was on foot pulled out his sword to do battle.\nWhat is your name? said Sir Tristram. Wit ye well, said that knight, my\nname is Sir Palomides. What knight hate ye most? said Sir Tristram. Sir\nknight, said he, I hate Sir Tristram to the death, for an I may meet\nwith him the one of us shall die. Ye say well, said Sir Tristram, and\nwit ye well that I am Sir Tristram de Liones, and now do your worst.\nWhen Sir Palomides heard him say so he was astonied. And then he said\nthus: I pray you, Sir Tristram, forgive me all mine evil will, and if I\nlive I shall do you service above all other knights that be living;\nand whereas I have owed you evil will me sore repenteth. I wot not\nwhat aileth me, for meseemeth that ye are a good knight, and none other\nknight that named himself a good knight should not hate you; therefore I\nrequire you, Sir Tristram, take no displeasure at mine unkind words. Sir\nPalomides, said Sir Tristram, ye say well, and well I wot ye are a good\nknight, for I have seen ye proved; and many great enterprises have ye\ntaken upon you, and well achieved them; therefore, said Sir Tristram, an\nye have any evil will to me, now may ye right it, for I am ready at your\nhand. Not so, my lord Sir Tristram, I will do you knightly service in\nall thing as ye will command. And right so I will take you, said Sir\nTristram. And so they rode forth on their ways talking of many things.\nO my lord Sir Tristram, said Dinadan, foul have ye mocked me, for God\nknoweth I came into this country for your sake, and by the advice of\nmy lord Sir Launcelot; and yet would not Sir Launcelot tell me the\ncertainty of you, where I should find you. Truly, said Sir Tristram, Sir\nLauncelot wist well where I was, for I abode within his own castle.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVIII. How they approached the Castle Lonazep, and of other\ndevices of the death of Sir Lamorak.\n\n\nTHUS they rode until they were ware of the Castle Lonazep. And then\nwere they ware of four hundred tents and pavilions, and marvellous great\nordinance. So God me help, said Sir Tristram, yonder I see the greatest\nordinance that ever I saw. Sir, said Palomides, meseemeth that there was\nas great an ordinance at the Castle of Maidens upon the rock, where ye\nwon the prize, for I saw myself where ye forjousted thirty knights. Sir,\nsaid Dinadan, and in Surluse, at that tournament that Galahalt of\nthe Long Isles made, the which there dured seven days, was as great a\ngathering as is here, for there were many nations. Who was the best?\nsaid Sir Tristram. Sir, it was Sir Launcelot du Lake and the noble\nknight, Sir Lamorak de Galis, and Sir Launcelot won the degree. I\ndoubt not, said Sir Tristram, but he won the degree, so he had not been\novermatched with many knights; and of the death of Sir Lamorak, said\nSir Tristram, it was over great pity, for I dare say he was the cleanest\nmighted man and the best winded of his age that was alive; for I knew\nhim that he was the biggest knight that ever I met withal, but if it\nwere Sir Launcelot. Alas, said Sir Tristram, full woe is me for his\ndeath. And if they were not the cousins of my lord Arthur that slew him,\nthey should die for it, and all those that were consenting to his death.\nAnd for such things, said Sir Tristram, I fear to draw unto the court of\nmy lord Arthur; I will that ye wit it, said Sir Tristram unto Gareth.\n\nSir, I blame you not, said Gareth, for well I understand the vengeance\nof my brethren Sir Gawaine, Agravaine, Gaheris, and Mordred. But as for\nme, said Sir Gareth, I meddle not of their matters, therefore there is\nnone of them that loveth me. And for I understand they be murderers of\ngood knights I left their company; and God would I had been by, said\nGareth, when the noble knight, Sir Lamorak, was slain. Now as Jesu be my\nhelp, said Sir Tristram, it is well said of you, for I had liefer than\nall the gold betwixt this and Rome I had been there. Y-wis,[1] said\nPalomides, and so would I had been there, and yet had I never the degree\nat no jousts nor tournament thereas he was, but he put me to the worse,\nor on foot or on horseback; and that day that he was slain he did the\nmost deeds of arms that ever I saw knight do in all my life days. And\nwhen him was given the degree by my lord Arthur, Sir Gawaine and his\nthree brethren, Agravaine, Gaheris, and Sir Mordred, set upon Sir\nLamorak in a privy place, and there they slew his horse. And so they\nfought with him on foot more than three hours, both before him and\nbehind him; and Sir Mordred gave him his death wound behind him at his\nback, and all to-hew him: for one of his squires told me that saw it.\nFie upon treason, said Sir Tristram, for it killeth my heart to hear\nthis tale. So it doth mine, said Gareth; brethren as they be mine I\nshall never love them, nor draw in their fellowship for that deed.\n\nNow speak we of other deeds, said Palomides, and let him be, for his\nlife ye may not get again. That is the more pity, said Dinadan, for\nSir Gawaine and his brethren, except you Sir Gareth, hate all the good\nknights of the Round Table for the most part; for well I wot an they\nmight privily, they hate my lord Sir Launcelot and all his kin, and\ngreat privy despite they have at him; and that is my lord Sir Launcelot\nwell ware of, and that causeth him to have the good knights of his kin\nabout him.\n\n\n[1] \"Y-wis\" (certainly); Caxton, \"ye wis\"; W. de Worde, \"truly.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIX. How they came to Humber bank, and how they found a ship\nthere, wherein lay the body of King Hermance.\n\n\nSIR, said Palomides, let us leave of this matter, and let us see how we\nshall do at this tournament. By mine advice, said Palomides, let us four\nhold together against all that will come. Not by my counsel, said\nSir Tristram, for I see by their pavilions there will be four hundred\nknights, and doubt ye not, said Sir Tristram, but there will be many\ngood knights; and be a man never so valiant nor so big, yet he may be\novermatched. And so have I seen knights done many times; and when they\nweened best to have won worship they lost it, for manhood is not worth\nbut if it be medled with wisdom. And as for me, said Sir Tristram, it\nmay happen I shall keep mine own head as well as another.\n\nSo thus they rode until that they came to Humber bank, where they heard\na cry and a doleful noise. Then were they ware in the wind where came\na rich vessel hilled over with red silk, and the vessel landed fast\nby them. Therewith Sir Tristram alighted and his knights. And so Sir\nTristram went afore and entered into that vessel. And when he came\nwithin he saw a fair bed richly covered, and thereupon lay a dead seemly\nknight, all armed save the head, was all be-bled with deadly wounds upon\nhim, the which seemed to be a passing good knight. How may this be, said\nSir Tristram, that this knight is thus slain? Then Sir Tristram was\nware of a letter in the dead knight's hand. Master mariners, said Sir\nTristram, what meaneth that letter? Sir, said they, in that letter ye\nshall hear and know how he was slain, and for what cause, and what was\nhis name. But sir, said the mariners, wit ye well that no man shall take\nthat letter and read it but if he be a good knight, and that he will\nfaithfully promise to revenge his death, else shall there be no knight\nsee that letter open. Wit ye well, said Sir Tristram, that some of us\nmay revenge his death as well as other, and if it be so as ye mariners\nsay his death shall be revenged. And therewith Sir Tristram took the\nletter out of the knight's hand, and it said thus: Hermance, king and\nlord of the Red City, I send unto all knights errant, recommending unto\nyou noble knights of Arthur's court. I beseech them all among them to\nfind one knight that will fight for my sake with two brethren that I\nbrought up of nought, and feloniously and traitorly they have slain me;\nwherefore I beseech one good knight to revenge my death. And he that\nrevengeth my death I will that he have my Red City and all my castles.\n\nSir, said the mariners, wit ye well this king and knight that here lieth\nwas a full worshipful man and of full great prowess, and full well he\nloved all manner knights errants. So God me help, said Sir Tristram,\nhere is a piteous case, and full fain would I take this enterprise upon\nme; but I have made such a promise that needs I must be at this great\ntournament, or else I am shamed. For well I wot for my sake in especial\nmy lord Arthur let make this jousts and tournament in this country; and\nwell I wot that many worshipful people will be there at that tournament\nfor to see me; therefore I fear me to take this enterprise upon me that\nI shall not come again by time to this jousts. Sir, said Palomides,\nI pray you give me this enterprise, and ye shall see me achieve it\nworshipfully, other else I shall die in this quarrel. Well, said Sir\nTristram, and this enterprise I give you, with this, that ye be with\nme at this tournament that shall be as this day seven night. Sir, said\nPalomides, I promise you that I shall be with you by that day if I be\nunslain or unmaimed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LX. How Sir Tristram with his fellowship came and were with an\nhost which after fought with Sir Tristram; and other matters.\n\n\nTHEN departed Sir Tristram, Gareth, and Sir Dinadan, and left Sir\nPalomides in the vessel; and so Sir Tristram beheld the mariners how\nthey sailed overlong Humber. And when Sir Palomides was out of their\nsight they took their horses and beheld about them. And then were they\nware of a knight that came riding against them unarmed, and nothing\nabout him but a sword. And when this knight came nigh them he saluted\nthem, and they him again. Fair knights, said that knight, I pray you\ninsomuch as ye be knights errant, that ye will come and see my castle,\nand take such as ye find there; I pray you heartily. And so they rode\nwith him until his castle, and there they were brought into the hall,\nthat was well apparelled; and so they were there unarmed, and set at a\nboard; and when this knight saw Sir Tristram, anon he knew him. And then\nthis knight waxed pale and wroth at Sir Tristram. When Sir Tristram saw\nhis host make such cheer he marvelled and said: Sir, mine host, what\ncheer make you? Wit thou well, said he, I fare the worse for thee, for\nI know thee, Sir Tristram de Liones, thou slewest my brother; and\ntherefore I give thee summons I will slay thee an ever I may get thee\nat large. Sir knight, said Sir Tristram, I am never advised that ever I\nslew any brother of yours; and if ye say that I did I will make amends\nunto my power. I will none amends, said the knight, but keep thee from\nme.\n\nSo when he had dined Sir Tristram asked his arms, and departed. And so\nthey rode on their ways, and within a while Sir Dinadan saw where came\na knight well armed and well horsed, without shield. Sir Tristram, said\nSir Dinadan, take keep to yourself, for I dare undertake yonder cometh\nyour host that will have ado with you. Let him come, said Sir Tristram,\nI shall abide him as well as I may. Anon the knight, when he came nigh\nSir Tristram, he cried and bade him abide and keep him. So they hurtled\ntogether, but Sir Tristram smote the other knight so sore that he bare\nhim over his horse's croup. That knight arose lightly and took his horse\nagain, and so rode fiercely to Sir Tristram, and smote him twice hard\nupon the helm. Sir knight, said Sir Tristram, I pray you leave off\nand smite me no more, for I would be loath to deal with you an I might\nchoose, for I have your meat and your drink within my body. For all that\nhe would not leave; and then Sir Tristram gave him such a buffet upon\nthe helm that he fell up-so-down from his horse, that the blood brast\nout at the ventails of his helm, and so he lay still likely to be dead.\nThen Sir Tristram said: Me repenteth of this buffet that I smote so\nsore, for as I suppose he is dead. And so they left him and rode on\ntheir ways.\n\nSo they had not ridden but a while, but they saw riding against them\ntwo full likely knights, well armed and well horsed, and goodly servants\nabout them. The one was Berrant le Apres, and he was called the King\nwith the Hundred Knights; and the other was Sir Segwarides, which were\nrenowned two noble knights. So as they came either by other the king\nlooked upon Sir Dinadan, that at that time he had Sir Tristram's helm\nupon his shoulder, the which helm the king had seen to-fore with the\nQueen of Northgalis, and that queen the king loved as paramour; and that\nhelm the Queen of Northgalis had given to La Beale Isoud, and the queen\nLa Beale Isoud gave it to Sir Tristram. Sir knight, said Berrant, where\nhad ye that helm? What would ye? said Sir Dinadan. For I will have ado\nwith thee, said the king, for the love of her that owed that helm, and\ntherefore keep you. So they departed and came together with all their\nmights of their horses, and there the King with the Hundred Knights\nsmote Sir Dinadan, horse and all, to the earth; and then he commanded\nhis servant: Go and take thou his helm off, and keep it. So the varlet\nwent to unbuckle his helm. What helm, what wilt thou do? said Sir\nTristram, leave that helm. To what intent, said the king, will ye, sir\nknight, meddle with that helm? Wit you well, said Sir Tristram, that\nhelm shall not depart from me or it be dearer bought. Then make you\nready, said Sir Berrant unto Sir Tristram. So they hurtled together, and\nthere Sir Tristram smote him down over his horse's tail; and then the\nking arose lightly, and gat his horse lightly again. And then he struck\nfiercely at Sir Tristram many great strokes. And then Sir Tristram gave\nSir Berrant such a buffet upon the helm that he fell down over his horse\nsore stonied. Lo, said Dinadan, that helm is unhappy to us twain, for I\nhad a fall for it, and now, sir king, have ye another fall.\n\nThen Segwarides asked: Who shall joust with me? I pray thee, said Sir\nGareth unto Dinadan, let me have this jousts. Sir, said Dinadan, I pray\nyou take it as for me. That is no reason, said Tristram, for this jousts\nshould be yours. At a word, said Dinadan, I will not thereof. Then\nGareth dressed him to Sir Segwarides, and there Sir Segwarides smote\nGareth and his horse to the earth. Now, said Sir Tristram to Dinadan,\njoust with yonder knight. I will not thereof, said Dinadan. Then will\nI, said Sir Tristram. And then Sir Tristram ran to him, and gave him a\nfall; and so they left them on foot, and Sir Tristram rode unto Joyous\nGard, and there Sir Gareth would not of his courtesy have gone into this\ncastle, but Sir Tristram would not suffer him to depart. And so they\nalighted and unarmed them, and had great cheer. But when Dinadan came\nafore La Beale Isoud he cursed the time that ever he bare Sir Tristram's\nhelm, and there he told her how Sir Tristram had mocked him. Then was\nthere laughing and japing at Sir Dinadan, that they wist not what to do\nwith him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXI. How Palomides went for to fight with two brethren for the\ndeath of King Hermance.\n\n\nNOW will we leave them merry within Joyous Gard, and speak we of Sir\nPalomides. Then Sir Palomides sailed evenlong Humber to the coasts of\nthe sea, where was a fair castle. And at that time it was early in the\nmorning, afore day. Then the mariners went unto Sir Palomides that slept\nfast. Sir knight, said the mariners, ye must arise, for here is a castle\nthere ye must go into. I assent me, said Sir Palomides; and therewithal\nhe arrived. And then he blew his horn that the mariners had given him.\nAnd when they within the castle heard that horn they put forth many\nknights; and there they stood upon the walls, and said with one voice:\nWelcome be ye to this castle. And then it waxed clear day, and Sir\nPalomides entered into the castle. And within a while he was served with\nmany divers meats. Then Sir Palomides heard about him much weeping and\ngreat dole. What may this mean? said Sir Palomides; I love not to hear\nsuch a sorrow, and fain I would know what it meaneth. Then there came\nafore him one whose name was Sir Ebel, that said thus: Wit ye well, sir\nknight, this dole and sorrow is here made every day, and for this cause:\nwe had a king that hight Hermance, and he was King of the Red City, and\nthis king that was lord was a noble knight, large and liberal of his\nexpense; and in the world he loved nothing so much as he did errant\nknights of King Arthur's court, and all jousting, hunting, and all\nmanner of knightly games; for so kind a king and knight had never the\nrule of poor people as he was; and because of his goodness and gentle\nness we bemoan him, and ever shall. And all kings and estates may\nbeware by our lord, for he was destroyed in his own default; for had he\ncherished them of his blood he had yet lived with great riches and rest:\nbut all estates may beware by our king. But alas, said Ebel, that we\nshall give all other warning by his death.\n\nTell me, said Palomides, and in what manner was your lord slain, and by\nwhom. Sir, said Sir Ebel, our king brought up of children two men that\nnow are perilous knights; and these two knights our king had so in\ncharity, that he loved no man nor trusted no man of his blood, nor\nnone other that was about him. And by these two knights our king was\ngoverned, and so they ruled him peaceably and his lands, and never would\nthey suffer none of his blood to have no rule with our king. And also he\nwas so free and so gentle, and they so false and deceivable, that they\nruled him peaceably; and that espied the lords of our king's blood,\nand departed from him unto their own livelihood. Then when these two\ntraitors understood that they had driven all the lords of his blood from\nhim, they were not pleased with that rule, but then they thought to have\nmore, as ever it is an old saw: Give a churl rule and thereby he will\nnot be sufficed; for whatsomever he be that is ruled by a villain born,\nand the lord of the soil to be a gentleman born, the same villain shall\ndestroy all the gentlemen about him: therefore all estates and lords,\nbeware whom ye take about you. And if ye be a knight of King Arthur's\ncourt remember this tale, for this is the end and conclusion. My lord\nand king rode unto the forest hereby by the advice of these traitors,\nand there he chased at the red deer, armed at all pieces full like a\ngood knight; and so for labour he waxed dry, and then he alighted, and\ndrank at a well. And when he was alighted, by the assent of these two\ntraitors, that one that hight Helius he suddenly smote our king through\nthe body with a spear, and so they left him there. And when they were\ndeparted, then by fortune I came to the well, and found my lord and king\nwounded to the death. And when I heard his complaint, I let bring him to\nthe water side, and in that same ship I put him alive; and when my lord\nKing Hermance was in that vessel, he required me for the true faith I\nowed unto him for to write a letter in this manner.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXII. The copy of the letter written for to revenge the king's\ndeath, and how Sir Palomides fought for to have the battle.\n\n\nRECOMMENDING unto King Arthur and to all his knights errant, beseeching\nthem all that insomuch as I, King Hermance, King of the Red City, thus\nam slain by felony and treason, through two knights of mine own, and of\nmine own bringing up and of mine own making, that some worshipful\nknight will revenge my death, insomuch I have been ever to my power well\nwilling unto Arthur's court. And who that will adventure his life with\nthese two traitors for my sake in one battle, I, King Hermance, King of\nthe Red City, freely give him all my lands and rents that ever I wielded\nin my life. This letter, said Ebel, I wrote by my lord's commandment,\nand then he received his Creator; and when he was dead, he commanded me\nor ever he were cold to put that letter fast in his hand. And then he\ncommanded me to put forth that same vessel down Humber, and I should\ngive these mariners in commandment never to stint until that they came\nunto Logris, where all the noble knights shall assemble at this time.\nAnd there shall some good knight have pity on me to revenge my death,\nfor there was never king nor lord falslier nor traitorlier slain than I\nam here to my death. Thus was the complaint of our King Hermance. Now,\nsaid Sir Ebel, ye know all how our lord was betrayed, we require you for\nGod's sake have pity upon his death, and worshipfully revenge his death,\nand then may ye wield all these lands. For we all wit well that an ye\nmay slay these two traitors, the Red City and all those that be therein\nwill take you for their lord.\n\nTruly, said Sir Palomides, it grieveth my heart for to hear you tell\nthis doleful tale; and to say the truth I saw the same letter that ye\nspeak of, and one of the best knights on the earth read that letter to\nme, and by his commandment I came hither to revenge your king's death;\nand therefore have done, and let me wit where I shall find those\ntraitors, for I shall never be at ease in my heart till I be in hands\nwith them. Sir, said Sir Ebel, then take your ship again, and that ship\nmust bring you unto the Delectable Isle, fast by the Red City, and we\nin this castle shall pray for you, and abide your again-coming. For\nthis same castle, an ye speed well, must needs be yours; for our King\nHermance let make this castle for the love of the two traitors, and so\nwe kept it with strong hand, and therefore full sore are we threated.\nWot ye what ye shall do, said Sir Palomides; whatsomever come of me,\nlook ye keep well this castle. For an it misfortune me so to be slain\nin this quest I am sure there will come one of the best knights of the\nworld for to revenge my death, and that is Sir Tristram de Liones, or\nelse Sir Launcelot du Lake.\n\nThen Sir Palomides departed from that castle. And as he came nigh the\ncity, there came out of a ship a goodly knight armed against him, with\nhis shield on his shoulder, and his hand upon his sword. And anon as he\ncame nigh Sir Palomides he said: Sir knight, what seek ye here? leave\nthis quest for it is mine, and mine it was or ever it was yours, and\ntherefore I will have it. Sir knight, said Palomides, it may well be\nthat this quest was yours or it was mine, but when the letter was taken\nout of the dead king's hand, at that time by likelihood there was no\nknight had undertaken to revenge the death of the king. And so at\nthat time I promised to revenge his death, and so I shall or else I am\nashamed. Ye say well, said the knight, but wit ye well then will I fight\nwith you, and who be the better knight of us both, let him take the\nbattle upon hand. I assent me, said Sir Palomides. And then they dressed\ntheir shields, and pulled out their swords, and lashed together many sad\nstrokes as men of might; and this fighting was more than an hour, but\nat the last Sir Palomides waxed big and better winded, so that then\nhe smote that knight such a stroke that he made him to kneel upon his\nknees. Then that knight spake on high and said: Gentle knight, hold thy\nhand. Sir Palomides was goodly and withdrew his hand. Then this knight\nsaid: Wit ye well, knight, that thou art better worthy to have this\nbattle than I, and require thee of knighthood tell me thy name. Sir, my\nname is Palomides, a knight of King Arthur's, and of the Table Round,\nthat hither I came to revenge the death of this dead king.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIII. Of the preparation of Sir Palomides and the two brethren\nthat should fight with him.\n\n\nWELL be ye found, said the knight to Palomides, for of all knights\nthat be alive, except three, I had liefest have you. The first is Sir\nLauncelot du Lake, and Sir Tristram de Liones, the third is my nigh\ncousin, Sir Lamorak de Galis. And I am brother unto King Hermance that\nis dead, and my name is Sir Hermind. Ye say well, said Sir Palomides,\nand ye shall see how I shall speed; and if I be there slain go ye to my\nlord Sir Launcelot, or else to my lord Sir Tristram, and pray them to\nrevenge my death, for as for Sir Lamorak him shall ye never see in this\nworld. Alas, said Sir Hermind, how may that be? He is slain, said\nSir Palomides, by Sir Gawaine and his brethren. So God me help, said\nHermind, there was not one for one that slew him. That is truth, said\nSir Palomides, for they were four dangerous knights that slew him,\nas Sir Gawaine, Sir Agravaine, Sir Gaheris, and Sir Mordred, but Sir\nGareth, the fifth brother was away, the best knight of them all. And so\nSir Palomides told Hermind all the manner, and how they slew Sir Lamorak\nall only by treason.\n\nSo Sir Palomides took his ship, and arrived up at the Delectable Isle.\nAnd in the meanwhile Sir Hermind that was the king's brother, he arrived\nup at the Red City, and there he told them how there was come a knight\nof King Arthur's to avenge King Hermance's death: And his name is Sir\nPalomides, the good knight, that for the most part he followeth the\nbeast Glatisant. Then all the city made great joy, for mickle had they\nheard of Sir Palomides, and of his noble prowess. So let they ordain a\nmessenger, and sent unto the two brethren, and bade them to make them\nready, for there was a knight come that would fight with them both. So\nthe messenger went unto them where they were at a castle there beside;\nand there he told them how there was a knight come of King Arthur's\ncourt to fight with them both at once. He is welcome, said they; but\ntell us, we pray you, if it be Sir Launcelot or any of his blood? He is\nnone of that blood, said the messenger. Then we care the less, said the\ntwo brethren, for with none of the blood of Sir Launcelot we keep not to\nhave ado withal. Wit ye well, said the messenger, that his name is Sir\nPalomides, that yet is unchristened, a noble knight. Well, said they, an\nhe be now unchristened he shall never be christened. So they appointed\nto be at the city within two days.\n\nAnd when Sir Palomides was come to the city they made passing great joy\nof him, and then they beheld him, and saw that he was well made, cleanly\nand bigly, and unmaimed of his limbs, and neither too young nor too old.\nAnd so all the people praised him; and though he was not christened yet\nhe believed in the best manner, and was full faithful and true of his\npromise, and well conditioned; and because he made his avow that he\nwould never be christened unto the time that he had achieved the\nbeast Glatisant, the which was a full wonderful beast, and a great\nsignification; for Merlin prophesied much of that beast. And also Sir\nPalomides avowed never to take full christendom unto the time that he\nhad done seven battles within the lists.\n\nSo within the third day there came to the city these two brethren, the\none hight Helius, the other hight Helake, the which were men of great\nprowess; howbeit that they were false and full of treason, and but poor\nmen born, yet were they noble knights of their hands. And with them they\nbrought forty knights, to that intent that they should be big enough for\nthe Red City. Thus came the two brethren with great bobaunce and pride,\nfor they had put the Red City in fear and damage. Then they were brought\nto the lists, and Sir Palomides came into the place and said thus: Be ye\nthe two brethren, Helius and Helake, that slew your king and lord,\nSir Hermance, by felony and treason, for whom that I am come hither to\nrevenge his death? Wit thou well, said Sir Helius and Sir Helake, that\nwe are the same knights that slew King Hermance; and wit thou well, Sir\nPalomides Saracen, that we shall handle thee so or thou depart that\nthou shalt wish that thou wert christened. It may well be, said Sir\nPalomides, for yet I would not die or I were christened; and yet so am\nI not afeard of you both, but I trust to God that I shall die a\nbetter christian man than any of you both; and doubt ye not, said Sir\nPalomides, either ye or I shall be left dead in this place.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIV. Of the battle between Sir Palomides and the two brethren,\nand how the two brethren were slain.\n\n\nTHEN they departed, and the two brethren came against Sir Palomides, and\nhe against them, as fast as their horses might run. And by fortune Sir\nPalomides smote Helake through his shield and through the breast more\nthan a fathom. All this while Sir Helius held up his spear, and for\npride and orgulit\u00e9 he would not smite Sir Palomides with his spear;\nbut when he saw his brother lie on the earth, and saw he might not help\nhimself, then he said unto Sir Palomides: Help thyself. And therewith\nhe came hurtling unto Sir Palomides with his spear, and smote him\nquite from his saddle. Then Sir Helius rode over Sir Palomides twice or\nthrice. And therewith Sir Palomides was ashamed, and gat the horse of\nSir Helius by the bridle, and therewithal the horse areared, and Sir\nPalomides halp after, and so they fell both to the earth; but anon Sir\nHelius stert up lightly, and there he smote Sir Palomides a great stroke\nupon the helm, that he kneeled upon his own knee. Then they lashed\ntogether many sad strokes, and traced and traversed now backward, now\nsideling, hurtling together like two boars, and that same time they fell\nboth grovelling to the earth.\n\nThus they fought still without any reposing two hours, and never\nbreathed; and then Sir Palomides waxed faint and weary, and Sir Helius\nwaxed passing strong, and doubled his strokes, and drove Sir Palomides\noverthwart and endlong all the field, that they of the city when they\nsaw Sir Palomides in this case they wept and cried, and made great dole,\nand the other party made as great joy. Alas, said the men of the city,\nthat this noble knight should thus be slain for our king's sake. And as\nthey were thus weeping and crying, Sir Palomides that had suffered an\nhundred strokes, that it was wonder that he stood on his feet, at the\nlast Sir Palomides beheld as he might the common people, how they wept\nfor him; and then he said to himself: Ah, fie for shame, Sir Palomides,\nwhy hangest thou thy head so low; and therewith he bare up his shield,\nand looked Sir Helius in the visage, and he smote him a great stroke\nupon the helm, and after that another and another. And then he smote Sir\nHelius with such a might that he fell to the earth grovelling; and\nthen he raced off his helm from his head, and there he smote him such a\nbuffet that he departed his head from the body. And then were the people\nof the city the joyfullest people that might be. So they brought him to\nhis lodging with great solemnity, and there all the people became his\nmen. And then Sir Palomides prayed them all to take keep unto all the\nlordship of King Hermance: For, fair sirs, wit ye well I may not as at\nthis time abide with you, for I must in all haste be with my lord King\nArthur at the Castle of Lonazep, the which I have promised. Then was\nthe people full heavy at his departing, for all that city proffered\nSir Palomides the third part of their goods so that he would abide with\nthem; but in no wise as at that time he would not abide.\n\nAnd so Sir Palomides departed, and so he came unto the castle thereas\nSir Ebel was lieutenant. And when they in the castle wist how Sir\nPalomides had sped, there was a joyful meiny; and so Sir Palomides\ndeparted, and came to the castle of Lonazep. And when he wist that Sir\nTristram was not there he took his way over Humber, and came unto Joyous\nGard, whereas Sir Tristram was and La Beale Isoud. Sir Tristram had\ncommanded that what knight errant came within the Joyous Gard, as in\nthe town, that they should warn Sir Tristram. So there came a man of\nthe town, and told Sir Tristram how there was a knight in the town, a\npassing goodly man. What manner of man is he, said Sir Tristram, and\nwhat sign beareth he? So the man told Sir Tristram all the tokens of\nhim. That is Palomides, said Dinadan. It may well be, said Sir Tristram.\nGo ye to him, said Sir Tristram unto Dinadan. So Dinadan went unto\nSir Palomides, and there either made other great joy, and so they lay\ntogether that night. And on the morn early came Sir Tristram and Sir\nGareth, and took them in their beds, and so they arose and brake their\nfast.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXV. How Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides met Breuse Saunce Pit\u00e9,\nand how Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud went unto Lonazep.\n\n\nAND then Sir Tristram desired Sir Palomides to ride into the fields and\nwoods. So they were accorded to repose them in the forest. And when they\nhad played them a great while they rode unto a fair well; and anon they\nwere ware of an armed knight that came riding against them, and there\neither saluted other. Then this armed knight spake to Sir Tristram, and\nasked what were these knights that were lodged in Joyous Gard. I wot not\nwhat they are, said Sir Tristram. What knights be ye? said that knight,\nfor meseemeth ye be no knights errant, because ye ride unarmed. Whether\nwe be knights or not we list not to tell thee our name. Wilt thou not\ntell me thy name? said that knight; then keep thee, for thou shalt die\nof my hands. And therewith he got his spear in his hands, and would have\nrun Sir Tristram through. That saw Sir Palomides, and smote his horse\ntraverse in midst of the side, that man and horse fell to the earth. And\ntherewith Sir Palomides alighted and pulled out his sword to have slain\nhim. Let be, said Sir Tristram, slay him not, the knight is but a fool,\nit were shame to slay him. But take away his spear, said Sir Tristram,\nand let him take his horse and go where that he will.\n\nSo when this knight arose he groaned sore of the fall, and so he took\nhis horse, and when he was up he turned then his horse, and required Sir\nTristram and Sir Palomides to tell him what knights they were. Now wit\nye well, said Sir Tristram, that my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, and\nthis knight's name is Sir Palomides. When he wist what they were he took\nhis horse with the spurs, because they should not ask him his name,\nand so rode fast away through thick and thin. Then came there by them a\nknight with a bended shield of azure, whose name was Epinogris, and\nhe came toward them a great wallop. Whither are ye riding? said Sir\nTristram. My fair lords, said Epinogris, I follow the falsest knight\nthat beareth the life; wherefore I require you tell me whether ye saw\nhim, for he beareth a shield with a case of red over it. So God me help,\nsaid Tristram, such a knight departed from us not a quarter of an hour\nagone; we pray you tell us his name. Alas, said Epinogris, why let ye\nhim escape from you? and he is so great a foe unto all errant knights:\nhis name is Breuse Saunce Pit\u00e9. Ah, fie for shame, said Sir Palomides,\nalas that ever he escaped mine hands, for he is the man in the world\nthat I hate most. Then every knight made great sorrow to other; and so\nEpinogris departed and followed the chase after him.\n\nThen Sir Tristram and his three fellows rode unto Joyous Gard; and there\nSir Tristram talked unto Sir Palomides of his battle, how he sped at the\nRed City, and as ye have heard afore so was it ended. Truly, said Sir\nTristram, I am glad ye have well sped, for ye have done worshipfully.\nWell, said Sir Tristram, we must forward to-morn. And then he devised\nhow it should be; and Sir Tristram devised to send his two pavilions to\nset them fast by the well of Lonazep, and therein shall be the queen La\nBeale Isoud. It is well said, said Sir Dinadan, but when Sir Palomides\nheard of that his heart was ravished out of measure: notwithstanding he\nsaid but little. So when they came to Joyous Gard Sir Palomides would\nnot have gone into the castle, but as Sir Tristram took him by the\nfinger, and led him into the castle. And when Sir Palomides saw La Beale\nIsoud he was ravished so that he might unnethe speak. So they went unto\nmeat, but Palomides might not eat, and there was all the cheer that\nmight be had. And on the morn they were apparelled to ride toward\nLonazep.\n\nSo Sir Tristram had three squires, and La Beale Isoud had three\ngentlewomen, and both the queen and they were richly apparelled; and\nother people had they none with them, but varlets to bear their shields\nand their spears. And thus they rode forth. So as they rode they saw\nafore them a rout of knights; it was the knight Galihodin with twenty\nknights with him. Fair fellows, said Galihodin, yonder come four\nknights, and a rich and a well fair lady: I am in will to take that lady\nfrom them. That is not of the best counsel, said one of Galihodin's\nmen, but send ye to them and wit what they will say; and so it was done.\nThere came a squire unto Sir Tristram, and asked them whether they would\njoust or else to lose their lady. Not so, said Sir Tristram, tell your\nlord I bid him come as many as we be, and win her and take her. Sir,\nsaid Palomides, an it please you let me have this deed, and I shall\nundertake them all four. I will that ye have it, said Sir Tristram,\nat your pleasure. Now go and tell your lord Galihodin, that this same\nknight will encounter with him and his fellows.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVI. How Sir Palomides jousted with Sir Galihodin, and after\nwith Sir Gawaine, and smote them down.\n\n\nTHEN this squire departed and told Galihodin; and then he dressed his\nshield, and put forth a spear, and Sir Palomides another; and there Sir\nPalomides smote Galihodin so hard that he smote both horse and man\nto the earth. And there he had an horrible fall. And then came there\nanother knight, and in the same wise he served him; and so he served the\nthird and the fourth, that he smote them over their horses' croups, and\nalways Sir Palomides' spear was whole. Then came six knights more of\nGalihodin's men, and would have been avenged upon Sir Palomides. Let\nbe, said Sir Galihodin, not so hardy, none of you all meddle with this\nknight, for he is a man of great bount\u00e9 and honour, and if he would ye\nwere not able to meddle with him. And right so they held them still.\nAnd ever Sir Palomides was ready to joust; and when he saw they would\nno more he rode unto Sir Tristram. Right well have ye done, said Sir\nTristram, and worshipfully have ye done as a good knight should. This\nGalihodin was nigh cousin unto Galahalt, the haut prince; and this\nGalihodin was a king within the country of Surluse.\n\nSo as Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, and La Beale Isoud rode together they\nsaw afore them four knights, and every man had his spear in his\nhand: the first was Sir Gawaine, the second Sir Uwaine, the third Sir\nSagramore le Desirous, and the fourth was Dodinas le Savage. When Sir\nPalomides beheld them, that the four knights were ready to joust, he\nprayed Sir Tristram to give him leave to have ado with them all so long\nas he might hold him on horseback. And if that I be smitten down I pray\nyou revenge me. Well, said Sir Tristram, I will as ye will, and ye are\nnot so fain to have worship but I would as fain increase your worship.\nAnd therewithal Sir Gawaine put forth his spear, and Sir Palomides\nanother; and so they came so eagerly together that Sir Palomides smote\nSir Gawaine to the earth, horse and all; and in the same wise he served\nUwaine, Sir Dodinas, and Sagramore. All these four knights Sir Palomides\nsmote down with divers spears And then Sir Tristram departed toward\nLonazep.\n\nAnd when they were departed then came thither Galihodin with his ten\nknights unto Sir Gawaine, and there he told him all how he had sped. I\nmarvel, said Sir Gawaine, what knights they be, that are so arrayed\nin green. And that knight upon the white horse smote me down, said\nGalihodin, and my three fellows. And so he did to me, said Gawaine; and\nwell I wot, said Sir Gawaine, that either he upon the white horse is Sir\nTristram or else Sir Palomides, and that gay beseen lady is Queen Isoud.\nThus they talked of one thing and of other.\n\nAnd in the meanwhile Sir Tristram passed on till that he came to the\nwell where his two pavilions were set; and there they alighted, and\nthere they saw many pavilions and great array. Then Sir Tristram left\nthere Sir Palomides and Sir Gareth with La Beale Isoud, and Sir Tristram\nand Sir Dinadan rode to Lonazep to hearken tidings; and Sir Tristram\nrode upon Sir Palomides' white horse. And when he came into the castle\nSir Dinadan heard a great horn blow, and to the horn drew many knights.\nThen Sir Tristram asked a knight: What meaneth the blast of that horn?\nSir, said that knight, it is all those that shall hold against King\nArthur at this tournament. The first is the King of Ireland, and the\nKing of Surluse, the King of Listinoise, the King of Northumberland, and\nthe King of the best part of Wales, with many other countries. And these\ndraw them to a council, to understand what governance they shall be of;\nbut the King of Ireland, whose name was Marhalt, and father to the good\nknight Sir Marhaus that Sir Tristram slew, had all the speech that\nSir Tristram might hear it. He said: Lords and fellows, let us look to\nourself, for wit ye well King Arthur is sure of many good knights, or\nelse he would not with so few knights have ado with us; therefore by my\ncounsel let every king have a standard and a cognisance by himself, that\nevery knight draw to their natural lord, and then may every king and\ncaptain help his knights if they have need. When Sir Tristram had heard\nall their counsel he rode unto King Arthur for to hear of his counsel.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVII. How Sir Tristram and his fellowship came into the\ntournament of Lonazep; and of divers jousts and matters.\n\n\nBUT Sir Tristram was not so soon come into the place, but Sir Gawaine\nand Sir Galihodin went to King Arthur, and told him: That same green\nknight in the green harness with the white horse smote us two down, and\nsix of our fellows this same day. Well, said Arthur. And then he called\nSir Tristram and asked him what was his name. Sir, said Sir Tristram, ye\nshall hold me excused as at this time, for ye shall not wit my name.\nAnd there Sir Tristram returned and rode his way. I have marvel, said\nArthur, that yonder knight will not tell me his name, but go thou,\nGriflet le Fise de Dieu, and pray him to speak with me betwixt us. Then\nSir Griflet rode after him and overtook him, and said him that King\nArthur prayed him for to speak with him secretly apart. Upon this\ncovenant, said Sir Tristram, I will speak with him; that I will turn\nagain so that ye will ensure me not to desire to hear my name. I shall\nundertake, said Sir Griflet, that he will not greatly desire it of you.\nSo they rode together until they came to King Arthur. Fair sir, said\nKing Arthur, what is the cause ye will not tell me your name? Sir, said\nSir Tristram, without a cause I will not hide my name. Upon what party\nwill ye hold? said King Arthur. Truly, my lord, said Sir Tristram, I wot\nnot yet on what party I will be on, until I come to the field, and there\nas my heart giveth me, there will I hold; but to-morrow ye shall see and\nprove on what party I shall come. And therewithal he returned and went\nto his pavilions.\n\nAnd upon the morn they armed them all in green, and came into the field;\nand there young knights began to joust, and did many worshipful deeds.\nThen spake Gareth unto Sir Tristram, and prayed him to give him leave\nto break his spear, for him thought shame to bear his spear whole again.\nWhen Sir Tristram heard him say so he laughed, and said: I pray you do\nyour best. Then Sir Gareth gat a spear and proffered to joust. That saw\na knight that was nephew unto the King of the Hundred Knights; his name\nwas Selises, and a good man of arms. So this knight Selises then dressed\nhim unto Sir Gareth, and they two met together so hard that either smote\nother down, his horse and all, to the earth, so they were both bruised\nand hurt; and there they lay till the King with the Hundred Knights halp\nSelises up, and Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides halp up Gareth again. And\nso they rode with Sir Gareth unto their pavilions, and then they pulled\noff his helm.\n\nAnd when La Beale Isoud saw Sir Gareth bruised in the face she asked him\nwhat ailed him. Madam, said Sir Gareth, I had a great buffet, and as I\nsuppose I gave another, but none of my fellows, God thank them, would\nnot rescue me. Forsooth, said Palomides, it longed not to none of us\nas this day to joust, for there have not this day jousted no proved\nknights, and needly ye would joust. And when the other party saw ye\nproffered yourself to joust they sent one to you, a passing good knight\nof his age, for I know him well, his name is Selises; and worshipfully\nye met with him, and neither of you are dishonoured, and therefore\nrefresh yourself that ye may be ready and whole to joust to-morrow.\nAs for that, said Gareth, I shall not fail you an I may bestride mine\nhorse.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVIII. How Sir Tristram and his fellowship jousted, and of the\nnoble feats that they did in that tourneying.\n\n\nNOW upon what party, said Tristram, is it best we be withal as to-morn?\nSir, said Palomides, ye shall have mine advice to be against King Arthur\nas to-morn, for on his party will be Sir Launcelot and many good knights\nof his blood with him. And the more men of worship that they be, the\nmore worship we shall win. That is full knightly spoken, said Sir\nTristram; and right so as ye counsel me, so will we do. In the name of\nGod, said they all. So that night they were lodged with the best. And\non the morn when it was day they were arrayed all in green trappings,\nshields and spears, and La Beale Isoud in the same colour, and her three\ndamosels. And right so these four knights came into the field endlong\nand through. And so they led La Beale Isoud thither as she should stand\nand behold all the jousts in a bay window; but always she was wimpled\nthat no man might see her visage. And then these three knights rode\nstraight unto the party of the King of Scots.\n\nWhen King Arthur had seen them do all this he asked Sir Launcelot what\nwere these knights and that queen. Sir, said Launcelot, I cannot say you\nin certain, but if Sir Tristram be in this country, or Sir Palomides,\nwit ye well it be they in certain, and La Beale Isoud. Then Arthur called\nto him Sir Kay and said: Go lightly and wit how many knights there be\nhere lacking of the Table Round, for by the sieges thou mayst know. So\nwent Sir Kay and saw by the writings in the sieges that there lacked ten\nknights. And these be their names that be not here. Sir Tristram, Sir\nPalomides, Sir Percivale, Sir Gaheris, Sir Epinogris, Sir Mordred, Sir\nDinadan, Sir La Cote Male Taile, and Sir Pelleas the noble knight. Well,\nsaid Arthur, some of these I dare undertake are here this day against\nus.\n\nThen came therein two brethren, cousins unto Sir Gawaine, the one hight\nSir Edward, that other hight Sir Sadok, the which were two good knights;\nand they asked of King Arthur that they might have the first jousts,\nfor they were of Orkney. I am pleased, said King Arthur. Then Sir Edward\nencountered with the King of Scots, in whose party was Sir Tristram and\nSir Palomides; and Sir Edward smote the King of Scots quite from his\nhorse, and Sir Sadok smote down the King of North Wales, and gave him\na wonder great fall, that there was a great cry on King Arthur's party,\nand that made Sir Palomides passing wroth. And so Sir Palomides dressed\nhis shield and his spear, and with all his might he met with Sir Edward\nof Orkney, that he smote him so hard that his horse might not stand on\nhis feet, and so they hurtled to the earth; and then with the same spear\nSir Palomides smote down Sir Sadok over his horse's croup. O Jesu, said\nArthur, what knight is that arrayed all in green? he jousteth mightily.\nWit you well, said Sir Gawaine, he is a good knight, and yet shall\nye see him joust better or he depart. And yet shall ye see, said Sir\nGawaine, another bigger knight, in the same colour, than he is; for\nthat same knight, said Sir Gawaine, that smote down right now my four\ncousins, he smote me down within these two days, and seven fellows more.\n\nThis meanwhile as they stood thus talking there came into the place Sir\nTristram upon a black horse, and or ever he stint he smote down with one\nspear four good knights of Orkney that were of the kin of Sir Gawaine;\nand Sir Gareth and Sir Dinadan everych of them smote down a good knight.\nJesu, said Arthur, yonder knight upon the black horse doth mightily and\nmarvellously well. Abide you, said Sir Gawaine; that knight with the\nblack horse began not yet. Then Sir Tristram made to horse again the two\nkings that Edward and Sadok had unhorsed at the beginning. And then Sir\nTristram drew his sword and rode into the thickest of the press against\nthem of Orkney; and there he smote down knights, and rashed off helms,\nand pulled away their shields, and hurtled down many knights: he fared\nso that Sir Arthur and all knights had great marvel when they saw one\nknight do so great deeds of arms. And Sir Palomides failed not upon the\nother side, but did so marvellously well that all men had wonder. For\nthere King Arthur likened Sir Tristram that was on the black horse like\nto a wood lion, and likened Sir Palomides upon the white horse unto a\nwood leopard, and Sir Gareth and Sir Dinadan unto eager wolves. But the\ncustom was such among them that none of the kings would help other, but\nall the fellowship of every standard to help other as they might; but\never Sir Tristram did so much deeds of arms that they of Orkney waxed\nweary of him, and so withdrew them unto Lonazep.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIX. How Sir Tristram was unhorsed and smitten down by Sir\nLauncelot, and after that Sir Tristram smote down King Arthur.\n\n\nTHEN was the cry of heralds and all manner of common people: The Green\nKnight hath done marvellously, and beaten all them of Orkney. And there\nthe heralds numbered that Sir Tristram that sat upon the black horse had\nsmitten down with spears and swords thirty knights; and Sir Palomides\nhad smitten down twenty knights, and the most part of these fifty\nknights were of the house of King Arthur, and proved knights. So God me\nhelp, said Arthur unto Sir Launcelot, this is a great shame to us to see\nfour knights beat so many knights of mine; and therefore make you ready,\nfor we will have ado with them. Sir, said Launcelot, wit ye well that\nthere are two passing good knights, and great worship were it not to us\nnow to have ado with them, for they have this day sore travailed. As for\nthat, said Arthur, I will be avenged; and therefore take with you Sir\nBleoberis and Sir Ector, and I will be the fourth, said Arthur. Sir,\nsaid Launcelot, ye shall find me ready, and my brother Sir Ector, and my\ncousin Sir Bleoberis. And so when they were ready and on horseback:\nNow choose, said Sir Arthur unto Sir Launcelot, with whom that ye will\nencounter withal. Sir, said Launcelot, I will meet with the green knight\nupon the black horse, that was Sir Tristram; and my cousin Sir Bleoberis\nshall match the green knight upon the white horse, that was Sir\nPalomides; and my brother Sir Ector shall match with the green knight\nupon the white horse, that was Sir Gareth. Then must I, said Sir Arthur,\nhave ado with the green knight upon the grisled horse, and that was Sir\nDinadan. Now every man take heed to his fellow, said Sir Launcelot. And\nso they trotted on together, and there encountered Sir Launcelot against\nSir Tristram. So Sir Launcelot smote Sir Tristram so sore upon the\nshield that he bare horse and man to the earth; but Sir Launcelot weened\nthat it had been Sir Palomides, and so he passed forth. And then Sir\nBleoberis encountered with Sir Palomides, and he smote him so hard upon\nthe shield that Sir Palomides and his white horse rustled to the earth.\nThen Sir Ector de Maris smote Sir Gareth so hard that down he fell off\nhis horse. And the noble King Arthur encountered with Sir Dinadan, and\nhe smote him quite from his saddle. And then the noise turned awhile how\nthe green knights were slain down.\n\nWhen the King of Northgalis saw that Sir Tristram had a fall, then he\nremembered him how great deeds of arms Sir Tristram had done. Then he\nmade ready many knights, for the custom and cry was such, that what\nknight were smitten down, and might not be horsed again by his fellows,\nouther by his own strength, that as that day he should be prisoner unto\nthe party that had smitten him down. So came in the King of Northgalis,\nand he rode straight unto Sir Tristram; and when he came nigh him he\nalighted down suddenly and betook Sir Tristram his horse, and said thus:\nNoble knight, I know thee not of what country that thou art, but for the\nnoble deeds that thou hast done this day take there my horse, and let me\ndo as well I may; for, as Jesu me help, thou art better worthy to have\nmine horse than I myself. Gramercy, said Sir Tristram, and if I may I\nshall quite you: look that ye go not far from us, and as I suppose, I\nshall win you another horse. And therewith Sir Tristram mounted upon his\nhorse, and there he met with King Arthur, and he gave him such a buffet\nupon the helm with his sword that King Arthur had no power to keep his\nsaddle. And then Sir Tristram gave the King of Northgalis King Arthur's\nhorse: then was there great press about King Arthur for to horse him\nagain; but Sir Palomides would not suffer King Arthur to be horsed\nagain, but ever Sir Palomides smote on the right hand and on the left\nhand mightily as a noble knight. And this meanwhile Sir Tristram rode\nthrough the thickest of the press, and smote down knights on the right\nhand and on the left hand, and raced off helms, and so passed forth unto\nhis pavilions, and left Sir Palomides on foot; and Sir Tristram changed\nhis horse and disguised himself all in red, horse and harness.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXX. How Sir Tristram changed his harness and it was all red,\nand how he demeaned him, and how Sir Palomides slew Launcelot's horse.\n\n\nAND when the queen La Beale Isoud saw that Sir Tristram was unhorsed,\nand she wist not where he was, then she wept greatly. But Sir Tristram,\nwhen he was ready, came dashing lightly into the field, and then La\nBeale Isoud espied him. And so he did great deeds of arms; with one\nspear, that was great, Sir Tristram smote down five knights or ever he\nstint. Then Sir Launcelot espied him readily, that it was Sir Tristram,\nand then he repented him that he had smitten him down; and so Sir\nLauncelot went out of the press to repose him and lightly he came again.\nAnd now when Sir Tristram came into the press, through his great force\nhe put Sir Palomides upon his horse, and Sir Gareth, and Sir Dinadan,\nand then they began to do marvellously; but Sir Palomides nor none of\nhis two fellows knew not who had holpen them on horseback again. But\never Sir Tristram was nigh them and succoured them, and they [knew]\nnot him, because he was changed into red armour: and all this while Sir\nLauncelot was away.\n\nSo when La Beale Isoud knew Sir Tristram again upon his horse-back she\nwas passing glad, and then she laughed and made good cheer. And as\nit happened, Sir Palomides looked up toward her where she lay in the\nwindow, and he espied how she laughed; and therewith he took such a\nrejoicing that he smote down, what with his spear and with his sword,\nall that ever he met; for through the sight of her he was so enamoured\nin her love that he seemed at that time, that an both Sir Tristram and\nSir Launcelot had been both against him they should have won no worship\nof him; and in his heart, as the book saith, Sir Palomides wished that\nwith his worship he might have ado with Sir Tristram before all men,\nbecause of La Beale Isoud. Then Sir Palomides began to double his\nstrength, and he did so marvellously that all men had wonder of him, and\never he cast up his eye unto La Beale Isoud. And when he saw her make\nsuch cheer he fared like a lion, that there might no man withstand him;\nand then Sir Tristram beheld him, how that Sir Palomides bestirred him;\nand then he said unto Sir Dinadan: So God me help, Sir Palomides is a\npassing good knight and a well enduring, but such deeds saw I him never\ndo, nor never heard I tell that ever he did so much in one day. It is\nhis day, said Dinadan; and he would say no more unto Sir Tristram; but\nto himself he said: An if ye knew for whose love he doth all those\ndeeds of arms, soon would Sir Tristram abate his courage. Alas, said Sir\nTristram, that Sir Palomides is not christened. So said King Arthur, and\nso said all those that beheld him. Then all people gave him the prize,\nas for the best knight that day, that he passed Sir Launcelot outher\nSir Tristram. Well, said Dinadan to himself, all this worship that Sir\nPalomides hath here this day he may thank the Queen Isoud, for had she\nbeen away this day Sir Palomides had not gotten the prize this day.\n\nRight so came into the field Sir Launcelot du Lake, and saw and heard\nthe noise and cry and the great worship that Sir Palomides had. He\ndressed him against Sir Palomides, with a great mighty spear and a long,\nand thought to smite him down. And when Sir Palomides saw Sir Launcelot\ncome upon him so fast, he ran upon Sir Launcelot as fast with his sword\nas he might; and as Sir Launcelot should have stricken him he smote his\nspear aside, and smote it a-two with his sword. And Sir Palomides rushed\nunto Sir Launcelot, and thought to have put him to a shame; and with his\nsword he smote his horse's neck that Sir Launcelot rode upon, and then\nSir Launcelot fell to the earth. Then was the cry huge and great: See\nhow Sir Palomides the Saracen hath smitten down Sir Launcelot's horse.\nRight then were there many knights wroth with Sir Palomides because he\nhad done that deed; therefore many knights held there against that it\nwas unknightly done in a tournament to kill an horse wilfully, but that\nit had been done in plain battle, life for life.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXI. How Sir Launcelot said to Sir Palomides, and how the prize\nof that day was given unto Sir Palomides.\n\n\nWHEN Sir Ector de Maris saw Sir Launcelot his brother have such a\ndespite, and so set on foot, then he gat a spear eagerly, and ran\nagainst Sir Palomides, and he smote him so hard that he bare him quite\nfrom his horse. That saw Sir Tristram, that was in red harness, and he\nsmote down Sir Ector de Maris quite from his horse. Then Sir Launcelot\ndressed his shield upon his shoulder, and with his sword naked in his\nhand, and so came straight upon Sir Palomides fiercely and said: Wit\nthou well thou hast done me this day the greatest despite that ever any\nworshipful knight did to me in tournament or in jousts, and therefore I\nwill be avenged upon thee, therefore take keep to yourself. Ah, mercy,\nnoble knight, said Palomides, and forgive me mine unkindly deeds, for I\nhave no power nor might to withstand you, and I have done so much\nthis day that well I wot I did never so much, nor never shall in my\nlife-days; and therefore, most noble knight, I require thee spare me as\nat this day, and I promise you I shall ever be your knight while I live:\nan ye put me from my worship now, ye put me from the greatest worship\nthat ever I had or ever shall have in my life-days. Well, said Sir\nLauncelot, I see, for to say thee sooth, ye have done marvellously well\nthis day; and I understand a part for whose love ye do it, and well I\nwot that love is a great mistress. And if my lady were here as she\nnis not, wit you well, said Sir Launcelot, ye should not bear away the\nworship. But beware your love be not discovered, for an Sir Tristram may\nknow it ye will repent it; and sithen my quarrel is not here, ye shall\nhave this day the worship as for me; considering the great travail and\npain that ye have had this day, it were no worship for me to put you\nfrom it. And therewithal Sir Launcelot suffered Sir Palomides to depart.\n\nThen Sir Launcelot by great force and might gat his own horse maugre\ntwenty knights. So when Sir Launcelot was horsed he did many marvels,\nand so did Sir Tristram, and Sir Palomides in like wise. Then Sir\nLauncelot smote down with a spear Sir Dinadan, and the King of Scotland,\nand the King of Wales, and the King of Northumberland, and the King\nof Listinoise. So then Sir Launcelot and his fellows smote down well\na forty knights. Then came the King of Ireland and the King of the\nStraight Marches to rescue Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides. There began\na great medley, and many knights were smitten down on both parties; and\nalways Sir Launcelot spared Sir Tristram, and he spared him. And Sir\nPalomides would not meddle with Sir Launcelot, and so there was hurtling\nhere and there. And then King Arthur sent out many knights of the\nTable Round; and Sir Palomides was ever in the foremost front, and Sir\nTristram did so strongly well that the king and all other had marvel.\nAnd then the king let blow to lodging; and because Sir Palomides began\nfirst, and never he went nor rode out of the field to repose, but ever\nhe was doing marvellously well either on foot or on horseback, and\nlongest during, King Arthur and all the kings gave Sir Palomides the\nhonour and the gree as for that day.\n\nThen Sir Tristram commanded Sir Dinadan to fetch the queen La Beale\nIsoud, and bring her to his two pavilions that stood by the well. And so\nDinadan did as he was commanded. But when Sir Palomides understood and\nwist that Sir Tristram was in the red armour, and on a red horse, wit ye\nwell that he was glad, and so was Sir Gareth and Sir Dinadan, for they\nall weened that Sir Tristram had been taken prisoner. And then every\nknight drew to his inn. And then King Arthur and every knight spake of\nthose knights; but above all men they gave Sir Palomides the prize, and\nall knights that knew Sir Palomides had wonder of his deeds. Sir, said\nSir Launcelot unto Arthur, as for Sir Palomides an he be the green\nknight I dare say as for this day he is best worthy to have the degree,\nfor he reposed him never, nor never changed his weeds, and he began\nfirst and longest held on. And yet, well I wot, said Sir Launcelot,\nthat there was a better knight than he, and that shall be proved or we\ndepart, upon pain of my life. Thus they talked on either party; and so\nSir Dinadan railed with Sir Tristram and said: What the devil is upon\nthee this day? for Sir Palomides' strength feebled never this day, but\never he doubled his strength.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXII. How Sir Dinadan provoked Sir Tristram to do well.\n\n\nAND thou, Sir Tristram, farest all this day as though thou hadst been\nasleep, and therefore I call thee coward. Well, Dinadan, said Sir\nTristram, I was never called coward or now of no earthly knight in my\nlife; and wit thou well, sir, I call myself never the more coward though\nSir Launcelot gave me a fall, for I outcept him of all knights. And\ndoubt ye not Sir Dinadan, an Sir Launcelot have a quarrel good, he\nis too over good for any knight that now is living; and yet of his\nsufferance, largess, bounty, and courtesy, I call him knight peerless:\nand so Sir Tristram was in manner wroth with Sir Dinadan. But all this\nlanguage Sir Dinadan said because he would anger Sir Tristram, for\nto cause him to awake his spirits and to be wroth; for well knew Sir\nDinadan that an Sir Tristram were thoroughly wroth Sir Palomides should\nnot get the prize upon the morn. And for this intent Sir Dinadan said\nall this railing and language against Sir Tristram. Truly, said Sir\nPalomides, as for Sir Launcelot, of his noble knighthood, courtesy, and\nprowess, and gentleness, I know not his peer; for this day, said\nSir Palomides, I did full uncourteously unto Sir Launcelot, and full\nunknightly, and full knightly and courteously he did to me again; for\nan he had been as ungentle to me as I was to him, this day I had won\nno worship. And therefore, said Palomides, I shall be Sir Launcelot's\nknight while my life lasteth. This talking was in the houses of kings.\nBut all kings, lords, and knights, said, of clear knighthood, and of\npure strength, of bounty, of courtesy, Sir Launcelot and Sir Tristram\nbare the prize above all knights that ever were in Arthur's days. And\nthere were never knights in Arthur's days did half so many deeds as they\ndid; as the book saith, no ten knights did not half the deeds that\nthey did, and there was never knight in their days that required Sir\nLauncelot or Sir Tristram of any quest, so it were not to their shame,\nbut they performed their desire.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIII. How King Arthur and Sir Lancelot came to see La Beale\nIsoud, and how Palomides smote down King Arthur.\n\n\nSO on the morn Sir Launcelot departed, and Sir Tristram was ready, and\nLa Beale Isoud with Sir Palomides and Sir Gareth. And so they rode all\nin green full freshly beseen unto the forest. And Sir Tristram left Sir\nDinadan sleeping in his bed. And so as they rode it happed the king and\nLauncelot stood in a window, and saw Sir Tristram ride and Isoud. Sir,\nsaid Launcelot, yonder rideth the fairest lady of the world except your\nqueen, Dame Guenever. Who is that? said Sir Arthur. Sir, said he, it is\nQueen Isoud that, out-taken my lady your queen, she is makeless. Take\nyour horse, said Arthur, and array you at all rights as I will do, and\nI promise you, said the king, I will see her. Then anon they were armed\nand horsed, and either took a spear and rode unto the forest. Sir, said\nLauncelot, it is not good that ye go too nigh them, for wit ye well\nthere are two as good knights as now are living, and therefore, sir, I\npray you be not too hasty. For peradventure there will be some knights\nbe displeased an we come suddenly upon them. As for that, said Arthur, I\nwill see her, for I take no force whom I grieve. Sir, said Launcelot, ye\nput yourself in great jeopardy. As for that, said the king, we will take\nthe adventure. Right so anon the king rode even to her, and saluted her,\nand said: God you save. Sir, said she, ye are welcome. Then the king\nbeheld her, and liked her wonderly well.\n\nWith that came Sir Palomides unto Arthur, and said: Uncourteous knight,\nwhat seekest thou here? thou art uncourteous to come upon a lady thus\nsuddenly, therefore withdraw thee. Sir Arthur took none heed of Sir\nPalomides' words, but ever he looked still upon Queen Isoud Then was Sir\nPalomides wroth, and therewith he took a spear, and came hurtling upon\nKing Arthur, and smote him down with a spear. When Sir Launcelot saw\nthat despite of Sir Palomides, he said to himself: I am loath to have\nado with yonder knight, and not for his own sake but for Sir Tristram.\nAnd one thing I am sure of, if I smite down Sir Palomides I must have\nado with Sir Tristram, and that were overmuch for me to match them both,\nfor they are two noble knights; notwithstanding, whether I live or I\ndie, needs must I revenge my lord, and so will I, whatsomever befall of\nme. And therewith Sir Launcelot cried to Sir Palomides: Keep thee from\nme. And then Sir Launcelot and Sir Palomides rushed together with two\nspears strongly, but Sir Launcelot smote Sir Palomides so hard that he\nwent quite out of his saddle, and had a great fall. When Sir Tristram\nsaw Sir Palomides have that fall, he said to Sir Launcelot: Sir knight,\nkeep thee, for I must joust with thee. As for to joust with me, said\nSir Launcelot, I will not fail you, for no dread I have of you; but I\nam loath to have ado with you an I might choose, for I will that ye\nwit that I must revenge my special lord that was unhorsed unwarly and\nunknightly. And therefore, though I revenged that fall, take ye no\ndispleasure therein, for he is to me such a friend that I may not see\nhim shamed.\n\nAnon Sir Tristram understood by his person and by his knightly words\nthat it was Sir Launcelot du Lake, and verily Sir Tristram deemed that\nit was King Arthur, he that Sir Palomides had smitten down. And then\nSir Tristram put his spear from him, and put Sir Palomides again\non horseback, and Sir Launcelot put King Arthur on horseback and so\ndeparted. So God me help, said Sir Tristram unto Palomides, ye did not\nworshipfully when ye smote down that knight so suddenly as ye did. And\nwit ye well ye did yourself great shame, for the knights came hither\nof their gentleness to see a fair lady; and that is every good knight's\npart, to behold a fair lady; and ye had not ado to play such masteries\nafore my lady. Wit thou well it will turn to anger, for he that ye smote\ndown was King Arthur, and that other was the good knight Sir Launcelot.\nBut I shall not forget the words of Sir Launcelot when that he called\nhim a man of great worship, thereby I wist that it was King Arthur.\nAnd as for Sir Launcelot, an there had been five hundred knights in the\nmeadow, he would not have refused them, and yet he said he would\nrefuse me. By that again I wist that it was Sir Launcelot, for ever he\nforbeareth me in every place, and showeth me great kindness; and of all\nknights, I out-take none, say what men will say, he beareth the flower\nof all chivalry, say it him whosomever will. An he be well angered, and\nthat him list to do his utterance without any favour, I know him not\nalive but Sir Launcelot is over hard for him, be it on horseback or on\nfoot. I may never believe, said Palomides, that King Arthur will ride so\nprivily as a poor errant knight. Ah, said Sir Tristram, ye know not\nmy lord Arthur, for all knights may learn to be a knight of him. And\ntherefore ye may be sorry, said Sir Tristram, of your unkindly deeds\nto so noble a king. And a thing that is done may not be undone, said\nPalomides. Then Sir Tristram sent Queen Isoud unto her lodging in the\npriory, there to behold all the tournament.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIV. How the second day Palomides forsook Sir Tristram, and\nwent to the contrary part against him.\n\n\nTHEN there was a cry unto all knights, that when they heard an horn\nblow they should make jousts as they did the first day. And like as the\nbrethren Sir Edward and Sir Sadok began the jousts the first day, Sir\nUwaine the king's son Urien and Sir Lucanere de Buttelere began the\njousts the second day. And at the first encounter Sir Uwaine smote down\nthe King's son of Scots; and Sir Lucanere ran against the King of Wales,\nand they brake their spears all to pieces; and they were so fierce both,\nthat they hurtled together that both fell to the earth. Then they of\nOrkney horsed again Sir Lucanere. And then came in Sir Tristram de\nLiones; and then Sir Tristram smote down Sir Uwaine and Sir Lucanere;\nand Sir Palomides smote down other two knights and Sir Gareth smote down\nother two knights. Then said Sir Arthur unto Sir Launcelot: See yonder\nthree knights do passingly well, and namely the first that jousted. Sir,\nsaid Launcelot, that knight began not yet but ye shall see him this day\ndo marvellously. And then came into the place the duke's son of Orkney,\nand then they began to do many deeds of arms.\n\nWhen Sir Tristram saw them so begin, he said to Palomides: How feel ye\nyourself? may ye do this day as ye did yesterday? Nay, said Palomides,\nI feel myself so weary, and so sore bruised of the deeds of yesterday,\nthat I may not endure as I did yesterday. That me repenteth, said Sir\nTristram, for I shall lack you this day. Sir Palomides said: Trust not\nto me, for I may not do as I did. All these words said Palomides for to\nbeguile Sir Tristram. Sir, said Sir Tristram unto Sir Gareth, then must\nI trust upon you; wherefore I pray you be not far from me to rescue me.\nAn need be, said Sir Gareth, I shall not fail you in all that I may do.\nThen Sir Palomides rode by himself; and then in despite of Sir Tristram\nhe put himself in the thickest press among them of Orkney, and there he\ndid so marvellously deeds of arms that all men had wonder of him, for\nthere might none stand him a stroke.\n\nWhen Sir Tristram saw Sir Palomides do such deeds, he marvelled and\nsaid to himself: He is weary of my company. So Sir Tristram beheld him\na great while and did but little else, for the noise and cry was so huge\nand great that Sir Tristram marvelled from whence came the strength\nthat Sir Palomides had there in the field Sir, said Sir Gareth unto\nSir Tristram, remember ye not of the words that Sir Dinadan said to you\nyesterday, when he called you a coward; forsooth, sir, he said it for\nnone ill, for ye are the man in the world that he most loveth, and all\nthat he said was for your worship. And therefore, said Sir Gareth to Sir\nTristram, let me know this day what ye be; and wonder ye not so upon Sir\nPalomides, for he enforceth himself to win all the worship and honour\nfrom you. I may well believe it, said Sir Tristram. And sithen I\nunderstand his evil will and his envy, ye shall see, if that I enforce\nmyself, that the noise shall be left that now is upon him.\n\nThen Sir Tristram rode into the thickest of the press, and then he did\nso marvellously well, and did so great deeds of arms, that all men said\nthat Sir Tristram did double so much deeds of arms as Sir Palomides had\ndone aforehand. And then the noise went plain from Sir Palomides, and\nall the people cried upon Sir Tristram. O Jesu, said the people, see how\nSir Tristram smiteth down with his spear so many knights. And see, said\nthey all, how many knights he smiteth down with his sword, and of how\nmany knights he rashed off their helms and their shields; and so he\nbeat them all of Orkney afore him. How now, said Sir Launcelot unto King\nArthur, I told you that this day there would a knight play his pageant.\nYonder rideth a knight ye may see he doth knightly, for he hath strength\nand wind. So God me help, said Arthur to Launcelot, ye say sooth, for I\nsaw never a better knight, for he passeth far Sir Palomides. Sir, wit\nye well, said Launcelot, it must be so of right, for it is himself, that\nnoble knight Sir Tristram. I may right well believe it, said Arthur.\n\nBut when Sir Palomides heard the noise and the cry was turned from him,\nhe rode out on a part and beheld Sir Tristram. And when Sir Palomides\nsaw Sir Tristram do so marvellously well he wept passingly sore for\ndespite, for he wist well he should no worship win that day; for well\nknew Sir Palomides, when Sir Tristram would put forth his strength and\nhis manhood, he should get but little worship that day.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXV. How Sir Tristram departed of the field, and awaked Sir\nDinadan, and changed his array into black.\n\n\nTHEN came King Arthur, and the King of Northgalis, and Sir Launcelot du\nLake; and Sir Bleoberis, Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir Ector de Maris, these\nthree knights came into the field with Sir Launcelot. And then Sir\nLauncelot with the three knights of his kin did so great deeds of arms\nthat all the noise began upon Sir Launcelot. And so they beat the King\nof Wales and the King of Scots far aback, and made them to avoid the\nfield; but Sir Tristram and Sir Gareth abode still in the field and\nendured all that ever there came, that all men had wonder that any\nknight might endure so many strokes. But ever Sir Launcelot, and his\nthree kinsmen by the commandment of Sir Launcelot, forbare Sir Tristram.\nThen said Sir Arthur: Is that Sir Palomides that endureth so well? Nay,\nsaid Sir Launcelot, wit ye well it is the good knight Sir Tristram, for\nyonder ye may see Sir Palomides beholdeth and hoveth, and doth little or\nnought. And sir, ye shall understand that Sir Tristram weeneth this day\nto beat us all out of the field. And as for me, said Sir Launcelot,\nI shall not beat him, beat him whoso will. Sir, said Launcelot unto\nArthur, ye may see how Sir Palomides hoveth yonder, as though he were in\na dream; wit ye well he is full heavy that Tristram doth such deeds of\narms Then is he but a fool, said Arthur, for never was Sir Palomides,\nnor never shall be, of such prowess as Sir Tristram. And if he have any\nenvy at Sir Tristram, and cometh in with him upon his side he is a false\nknight.\n\nAs the king and Sir Launcelot thus spake, Sir Tristram rode privily out\nof the press, that none espied him but La Beale Isoud and Sir Palomides,\nfor they two would not let off their eyes upon Sir Tristram. And when\nSir Tristram came to his pavilions he found Sir Dinadan in his bed\nasleep. Awake, said Tristram, ye ought to be ashamed so to sleep when\nknights have ado in the field. Then Sir Dinadan arose lightly and said:\nWhat will ye that I shall do? Make you ready, said Sir Tristram, to ride\nwith me into the field. So when Sir Dinadan was armed he looked upon Sir\nTristram's helm and on his shield, and when he saw so many strokes upon\nhis helm and upon his shield he said: In good time was I thus asleep,\nfor had I been with you I must needs for shame there have followed you;\nmore for shame than any prowess that is in me; that I see well now by\nthose strokes that I should have been truly beaten as I was yesterday.\nLeave your japes, said Sir Tristram, and come off, that [we] were in\nthe field again. What, said Sir Dinadan, is your heart up? yesterday\nye fared as though ye had dreamed. So then Sir Tristram was arrayed in\nblack harness. O Jesu, said Dinadan, what aileth you this day? meseemeth\nye be wilder than ye were yesterday. Then smiled Sir Tristram and said\nto Dinadan: Await well upon me; if ye see me overmatched look that ye\nbe ever behind me, and I shall make you ready way by God's grace. So\nSir Tristram and Sir Dinadan took their horses. All this espied Sir\nPalomides, both their going and their coming, and so did La Beale Isoud,\nfor she knew Sir Tristram above all other.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVI. How Sir Palomides changed his shield and his armour for\nto hurt Sir Tristram, and how Sir Launcelot did to Sir Tristram.\n\n\nTHEN when Sir Palomides saw that Sir Tristram was disguised, then he\nthought to do him a shame. So Sir Palomides rode to a knight that was\nsore wounded, that sat under a fair well from the field. Sir knight,\nsaid Sir Palomides, I pray you to lend me your armour and your shield,\nfor mine is over-well known in this field, and that hath done me great\ndamage; and ye shall have mine armour and my shield that is as sure as\nyours. I will well, said the knight, that ye have mine armour and my\nshield, if they may do you any avail. So Sir Palomides armed him hastily\nin that knight's armour and his shield that shone as any crystal or\nsilver, and so he came riding into the field. And then there was neither\nSir Tristram nor none of King Arthur's party that knew Sir Palomides.\nAnd right so as Sir Palomides was come into the field Sir Tristram smote\ndown three knights, even in the sight of Sir Palomides. And then Sir\nPalomides rode against Sir Tristram, and either met other with great\nspears, that they brast to their hands. And then they dashed together\nwith swords eagerly. Then Sir Tristram had marvel what knight he was\nthat did battle so knightly with him. Then was Sir Tristram wroth, for\nhe felt him passing strong, so that he deemed he might not have ado with\nthe remnant of the knights, because of the strength of Sir Palomides.\nSo they lashed together and gave many sad strokes together, and many\nknights marvelled what knight he might be that so encountered with the\nblack knight, Sir Tristram. Full well knew La Beale Isoud that there was\nSir Palomides that fought with Sir Tristram, for she espied all in her\nwindow where that she stood, as Sir Palomides changed his harness with\nthe wounded knight. And then she began to weep so heartily for the\ndespite of Sir Palomides that there she swooned.\n\nThen came in Sir Launcelot with the knights of Orkney. And when the\nother party had espied Sir Launcelot, they cried: Return, return,\nhere cometh Sir Launcelot du Lake. So there came knights and said: Sir\nLauncelot, ye must needs fight with yonder knight in the black harness,\nthat was Sir Tristram, for he hath almost overcome that good knight that\nfighteth with him with the silver shield, that was Sir Palomides. Then\nSir Launcelot rode betwixt Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides, and Sir\nLauncelot said to Palomides: Sir knight, let me have the battle, for ye\nhave need to be reposed. Sir Palomides knew Sir Launcelot well, and so\ndid Sir Tristram, but because Sir Launcelot was far hardier knight than\nhimself therefore he was glad, and suffered Sir Launcelot to fight with\nSir Tristram. For well wist he that Sir Launcelot knew not Sir Tristram,\nand there he hoped that Sir Launcelot should beat or shame Sir Tristram,\nwhereof Sir Palomides was full fain. And so Sir Launcelot gave Sir\nTristram many sad strokes, but Sir Launcelot knew not Sir Tristram,\nbut Sir Tristram knew well Sir Launcelot. And thus they fought long\ntogether, that La Beale Isoud was well-nigh out of her mind for sorrow.\n\nThen Sir Dinadan told Sir Gareth how that knight in the black harness\nwas Sir Tristram: And this is Launcelot that fighteth with him, that\nmust needs have the better of him, for Sir Tristram hath had too much\ntravail this day. Then let us smite him down, said Sir Gareth. So it is\nbetter that we do, said Sir Dinadan, than Sir Tristram be shamed, for\nyonder hoveth the strong knight with the silver shield to fall upon Sir\nTristram if need be. Then forthwithal Gareth rushed upon Sir Launcelot,\nand gave him a great stroke upon his helm so hard that he was astonied.\nAnd then came Sir Dinadan with a spear, and he smote Sir Launcelot such\na buffet that horse and all fell to the earth. O Jesu, said Sir Tristram\nto Sir Gareth and Sir Dinadan, fie for shame, why did ye smite down so\ngood a knight as he is, and namely when I had ado with him? now ye do\nyourself great shame, and him no disworship; for I held him reasonable\nhot, though ye had not holpen me.\n\nThen came Sir Palomides that was disguised, and smote down Sir Dinadan\nfrom his horse. Then Sir Launcelot, because Sir Dinadan had smitten him\naforehand, then Sir Launcelot assailed Sir Dinadan passing sore, and Sir\nDinadan defended him mightily. But well understood Sir Tristram that\nSir Dinadan might not endure Sir Launcelot, wherefore Sir Tristram was\nsorry. Then came Sir Palomides fresh upon Sir Tristram. And when Sir\nTristram saw him come, he thought to deliver him at once, because that\nhe would help Sir Dinadan, because he stood in great peril with Sir\nLauncelot. Then Sir Tristram hurtled unto Sir Palomides and gave him\na great buffet, and then Sir Tristram gat Sir Palomides and pulled him\ndown underneath him. And so fell Sir Tristram with him; and Sir Tristram\nleapt up lightly and left Sir Palomides, and went betwixt Sir Launcelot\nand Dinadan, and then they began to do battle together.\n\nRight so Sir Dinadan gat Sir Tristram's horse, and said on high that Sir\nLauncelot might hear it: My lord Sir Tristram, take your horse. And when\nSir Launcelot heard him name Sir Tristram: O Jesu, said Launcelot, what\nhave I done? I am dishonoured. Ah, my lord Sir Tristram, said Launcelot,\nwhy were ye disguised? ye have put yourself in great peril this day; but\nI pray you noble knight to pardon me, for an I had known you we had not\ndone this battle. Sir, said Sir Tristram, this is not the first kindness\nye showed me. So they were both horsed again.\n\nThen all the people on the one side gave Sir Launcelot the honour and\nthe degree, and on the other side all the people gave to the noble\nknight Sir Tristram the honour and the degree; but Launcelot said nay\nthereto: For I am not worthy to have this honour, for I will report me\nunto all knights that Sir Tristram hath been longer in the field than\nI, and he hath smitten down many more knights this day than I have done.\nAnd therefore I will give Sir Tristram my voice and my name, and so I\npray all my lords and fellows so to do. Then there was the whole voice\nof dukes and earls, barons and knights, that Sir Tristram this day is\nproved the best knight.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVII. How Sir Tristram departed with La Beale Isoud, and how\nPalomides followed and excused him.\n\n\nTHEN they blew unto lodging, and Queen Isoud was led unto her pavilions.\nBut wit you well she was wroth out of measure with Sir Palomides, for\nshe saw all his treason from the beginning to the ending. And all this\nwhile neither Sir Tristram, neither Sir Gareth nor Dinadan, knew not\nof the treason of Sir Palomides; but afterward ye shall hear that there\nbefell the greatest debate betwixt Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides that\nmight be.\n\nSo when the tournament was done, Sir Tristram, Gareth, and Dinadan, rode\nwith La Beale Isoud to these pavilions. And ever Sir Palomides rode with\nthem in their company disguised as he was. But when Sir Tristram had\nespied him that he was the same knight with the shield of silver that\nheld him so hot that day: Sir knight, said Sir Tristram, wit ye well\nhere is none that hath need of your fellowship, and therefore I pray you\ndepart from us. Sir Palomides answered again as though he had not known\nSir Tristram: Wit you well, sir knight, from this fellowship will I\nnever depart, for one of the best knights of the world commanded me to\nbe in this company, and till he discharge me of my service I will not be\ndischarged. By that Sir Tristram knew that it was Sir Palomides. Ah, Sir\nPalomides, said the noble knight Sir Tristram, are ye such a knight? Ye\nhave been named wrong, for ye have long been called a gentle knight,\nand as this day ye have showed me great ungentleness, for ye had almost\nbrought me unto my death. But, as for you, I suppose I should have done\nwell enough, but Sir Launcelot with you was overmuch; for I know no\nknight living but Sir Launcelot is over good for him, an he will do his\nuttermost. Alas, said Sir Palomides, are ye my lord Sir Tristram? Yea,\nsir, and that ye know well enough. By my knighthood, said Palomides,\nuntil now I knew you not; I weened that ye had been the King of Ireland,\nfor well I wot ye bare his arms. His arms I bare, said Sir Tristram,\nand that will I stand by, for I won them once in a field of a full noble\nknight, his name was Sir Marhaus; and with great pain I won that knight,\nfor there was none other recover, but Sir Marhaus died through false\nleeches; and yet was he never yolden to me. Sir, said Palomides, I\nweened ye had been turned upon Sir Launcelot's party, and that caused\nme to turn. Ye say well, said Sir Tristram, and so I take you, and I\nforgive you.\n\nSo then they rode into their pavilions; and when they were alighted they\nunarmed them and washed their faces and hands, and so yode unto meat,\nand were set at their table. But when Isoud saw Sir Palomides she\nchanged then her colours, and for wrath she might not speak. Anon Sir\nTristram espied her countenance and said: Madam, for what cause make ye\nus such cheer? we have been sore travailed this day. Mine own lord, said\nLa Beale Isoud, for God's sake be ye not displeased with me, for I may\nnone otherwise do; for I saw this day how ye were betrayed and nigh\nbrought to your death. Truly, sir, I saw every deal, how and in what\nwise, and therefore, sir, how should I suffer in your presence such a\nfelon and traitor as Sir Palomides; for I saw him with mine eyes, how he\nbeheld you when ye went out of the field. For ever he hoved still upon\nhis horse till he saw you come in againward. And then forthwithal I\nsaw him ride to the hurt knight, and changed harness with him, and then\nstraight I saw him how he rode into the field. And anon as he had found\nyou he encountered with you, and thus wilfully Sir Palomides did battle\nwith you; and as for him, sir, I was not greatly afraid, but I dread\nsore Launcelot, that knew you not. Madam, said Palomides, ye may say\nwhatso ye will, I may not contrary you, but by my knighthood I knew not\nSir Tristram. Sir Palomides, said Sir Tristram, I will take your excuse,\nbut well I wot ye spared me but little, but all is pardoned on my part.\nThen La Beale Isoud held down her head and said no more at that time.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVIII. How King Arthur and Sir Launcelot came unto their\npavilions as they sat at supper, and of Sir Palomides.\n\n\nAND therewithal two knights armed came unto the pavilion, and there they\nalighted both, and came in armed at all pieces. Fair knights, said Sir\nTristram, ye are to blame to come thus armed at all pieces upon me while\nwe are at our meat; if ye would anything when we were in the field there\nmight ye have eased your hearts. Not so, said the one of those knights,\nwe come not for that intent, but wit ye well Sir Tristram, we be come\nhither as your friends. And I am come here, said the one, for to see\nyou, and this knight is come for to see La Beale Isoud. Then said Sir\nTristram: I require you do off your helms that I may see you. That will\nwe do at your desire, said the knights. And when their helms were off,\nSir Tristram thought that he should know them.\n\nThen said Sir Dinadan privily unto Sir Tristram: Sir, that is Sir\nLauncelot du Lake that spake unto you first, and the other is my lord\nKing Arthur. Then, said Sir Tristram unto La Beale Isoud, Madam arise,\nfor here is my lord, King Arthur. Then the king and the queen kissed,\nand Sir Launcelot and Sir Tristram braced either other in arms, and then\nthere was joy without measure; and at the request of La Beale Isoud,\nKing Arthur and Launcelot were unarmed, and then there was merry\ntalking. Madam, said Sir Arthur, it is many a day sithen that I have\ndesired to see you, for ye have been praised so far; and now I dare say\nye are the fairest that ever I saw, and Sir Tristram is as fair and as\ngood a knight as any that I know; therefore me beseemeth ye are well\nbeset together. Sir, God thank you, said the noble knight, Sir Tristram,\nand Isoud; of your great goodness and largess ye are peerless. Thus they\ntalked of many things and of all the whole jousts. But for what cause,\nsaid King Arthur, were ye, Sir Tristram, against us? Ye are a knight\nof the Table Round; of right ye should have been with us. Sir, said Sir\nTristram, here is Dinadan, and Sir Gareth your own nephew, caused me to\nbe against you. My lord Arthur, said Gareth, I may well bear the blame,\nbut it were Sir Tristram's own deeds. That may I repent, said Dinadan,\nfor this unhappy Sir Tristram brought us to this tournament, and many\ngreat buffets he caused us to have. Then the king and Launcelot laughed\nthat they might not sit.\n\nWhat knight was that, said Arthur, that held you so short, this with the\nshield of silver? Sir, said Sir Tristram, here he sitteth at this board.\nWhat, said Arthur, was it Sir Palomides? Wit ye well it was he, said La\nBeale Isoud. So God me help, said Arthur, that was unknightly done\nof you of so good a knight, for I have heard many people call you a\ncourteous knight. Sir, said Palomides, I knew not Sir Tristram, for he\nwas so disguised. So God me help, said Launcelot, it may well be, for I\nknew not Sir Tristram; but I marvel why ye turned on our party. That was\ndone for the same cause, said Launcelot. As for that, said Sir Tristram,\nI have pardoned him, and I would be right loath to leave his fellowship,\nfor I love right well his company: so they left off and talked of other\nthings.\n\nAnd in the evening King Arthur and Sir Launcelot departed unto their\nlodging; but wit ye well Sir Palomides had envy heartily, for all that\nnight he had never rest in his bed, but wailed and wept out of measure.\nSo on the morn Sir Tristram, Gareth, and Dinadan arose early, and then\nthey went unto Sir Palomides' chamber, and there they found him fast\nasleep, for he had all night watched, and it was seen upon his cheeks\nthat he had wept full sore. Say nothing, said Sir Tristram, for I am\nsure he hath taken anger and sorrow for the rebuke that I gave to him,\nand La Beale Isoud.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIX. How Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides did the next day, and\nhow King Arthur was unhorsed.\n\n\nTHEN Sir Tristram let call Sir Palomides, and bade him make him ready,\nfor it was time to go to the field. When they were ready they were\narmed, and clothed all in red, both Isoud and all they; and so they led\nher passing freshly through the field, into the priory where was her\nlodging. And then they heard three blasts blow, and every king and\nknight dressed him unto the field. And the first that was ready to\njoust was Sir Palomides and Sir Kainus le Strange, a knight of the Table\nRound. And so they two encountered together, but Sir Palomides smote\nSir Kainus so hard that he smote him quite over his horse's croup. And\nforthwithal Sir Palomides smote down another knight, and brake then\nhis spear, and pulled out his sword and did wonderly well. And then the\nnoise began greatly upon Sir Palomides. Lo, said King Arthur, yonder\nPalomides beginneth to play his pageant. So God me help, said Arthur, he\nis a passing good knight. And right as they stood talking thus, in came\nSir Tristram as thunder, and he encountered with Sir Kay the Seneschal,\nand there he smote him down quite from his horse; and with that same\nspear Sir Tristram smote down three knights more, and then he pulled out\nhis sword and did marvellously. Then the noise and cry changed from\nSir Palomides and turned to Sir Tristram, and all the people cried: O\nTristram, O Tristram. And then was Sir Palomides clean forgotten.\n\nHow now, said Launcelot unto Arthur, yonder rideth a knight that playeth\nhis pageants. So God me help, said Arthur to Launcelot, ye shall see\nthis day that yonder two knights shall here do this day wonders. Sir,\nsaid Launcelot, the one knight waiteth upon the other, and enforceth\nhimself through envy to pass the noble knight Sir Tristram, and he\nknoweth not of the privy envy the which Sir Palomides hath to him; for\nall that the noble Sir Tristram doth is through clean knighthood. And\nthen Sir Gareth and Dinadan did wonderly great deeds of arms, as two\nnoble knights, so that King Arthur spake of them great honour and\nworship; and the kings and knights of Sir Tristram's side did passingly\nwell, and held them truly together. Then Sir Arthur and Sir Launcelot\ntook their horses and dressed them, and gat into the thickest of the\npress. And there Sir Tristram unknowing smote down King Arthur, and then\nSir Launcelot would have rescued him, but there were so many upon Sir\nLauncelot that they pulled him down from his horse. And then the King of\nIreland and the King of Scots with their knights did their pain to take\nKing Arthur and Sir Launcelot prisoner. When Sir Launcelot heard them\nsay so, he fared as it had been an hungry lion, for he fared so that no\nknight durst nigh him.\n\nThen came Sir Ector de Maris, and he bare a spear against Sir Palomides,\nand brast it upon him all to shivers. And then Sir Ector came again and\ngave Sir Palomides such a dash with a sword that he stooped down upon\nhis saddle bow. And forthwithal Sir Ector pulled down Sir Palomides\nunder his feet; and then Sir Ector de Maris gat Sir Launcelot du Lake\nan horse, and brought it to him, and bade him mount upon him; but Sir\nPalomides leapt afore and gat the horse by the bridle, and leapt into\nthe saddle. So God me help, said Launcelot, ye are better worthy to have\nthat horse than I. Then Sir Ector brought Sir Launcelot another horse.\nGramercy, said Launcelot unto his brother. And so when he was horsed\nagain, with one spear he smote down four knights. And then Sir Launcelot\nbrought to King Arthur one of the best of the four horses. Then Sir\nLauncelot with King Arthur and a few of his knights of Sir Launcelot's\nkin did marvellous deeds; for that time, as the book recordeth, Sir\nLauncelot smote down and pulled down thirty knights. Notwithstanding the\nother party held them so fast together that King Arthur and his knights\nwere overmatched. And when Sir Tristram saw that, what labour King\nArthur and his knights, and in especial the noble deeds that Sir\nLauncelot did with his own hands, he marvelled greatly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXX. How Sir Tristram turned to King Arthur's side, and how\nPalomides would not.\n\n\nTHEN Sir Tristram called unto him Sir Palomides, Sir Gareth, and Sir\nDinadan, and said thus to them: My fair fellows, wit ye well that I will\nturn unto King Arthur's party, for I saw never so few men do so well,\nand it will be shame unto us knights that be of the Round Table to\nsee our lord King Arthur, and that noble knight Sir Launcelot, to be\ndishonoured. It will be well done, said Sir Gareth and Sir Dinadan. Do\nyour best, said Palomides, for I will not change my party that I came\nin withal. That is for my sake, said Sir Tristram; God speed you in your\njourney. And so departed Sir Palomides from them. Then Sir Tristram,\nGareth, and Dinadan, turned with Sir Launcelot. And then Sir Launcelot\nsmote down the King of Ireland quite from his horse; and so Sir\nLauncelot smote down the King of Scots, and the King of Wales; and then\nSir Arthur ran unto Sir Palomides and smote him quite from his horse;\nand then Sir Tristram bare down all that he met. Sir Gareth and Sir\nDinadan did there as noble knights; then all the parties began to flee.\nAlas, said Palomides, that ever I should see this day, for now have I\nlost all the worship that I won; and then Sir Palomides went his way\nwailing, and so withdrew him till he came to a well, and there he put\nhis horse from him, and did off his armour, and wailed and wept like\nas he had been a wood man. Then many knights gave the prize to Sir\nTristram, and there were many that gave the prize unto Sir Launcelot.\nFair lords, said Sir Tristram, I thank you of the honour ye would\ngive me, but I pray you heartily that ye would give your voice to Sir\nLauncelot, for by my faith said Sir Tristram, I will give Sir Launcelot\nmy voice. But Sir Launcelot would not have it, and so the prize was\ngiven betwixt them both.\n\nThen every man rode to his lodging, and Sir Bleoberis and Sir Ector rode\nwith Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud unto their pavilions. Then as Sir\nPalomides was at the well wailing and weeping, there came by him flying\nthe kings of Wales and of Scotland, and they saw Sir Palomides in that\narage. Alas, said they, that so noble a man as ye be should be in this\narray. And then those kings gat Sir Palomides' horse again, and made him\nto arm him and mount upon his horse, and so he rode with them, making\ngreat dole. So when Sir Palomides came nigh the pavilions thereas Sir\nTristram and La Beale Isoud was in, then Sir Palomides prayed the two\nkings to abide him there the while that he spake with Sir Tristram. And\nwhen he came to the port of the pavilions, Sir Palomides said on high:\nWhere art thou, Sir Tristram de Liones? Sir, said Dinadan, that is\nPalomides. What, Sir Palomides, will ye not come in here among us? Fie\non thee traitor, said Palomides, for wit you well an it were daylight\nas it is night I should slay thee, mine own hands. And if ever I may get\nthee, said Palomides, thou shalt die for this day's deed. Sir Palomides,\nsaid Sir Tristram, ye wite me with wrong, for had ye done as I did ye\nhad won worship. But sithen ye give me so large warning I shall be\nwell ware of you. Fie on thee, traitor, said Palomides, and therewith\ndeparted.\n\nThen on the morn Sir Tristram, Bleoberis, and Sir Ector de Maris, Sir\nGareth, Sir Dinadan, what by water and what by land, they brought La\nBeale Isoud unto Joyous Gard, and there reposed them a seven night, and\nmade all the mirths and disports that they could devise. And King Arthur\nand his knights drew unto Camelot, and Sir Palomides rode with the two\nkings; and ever he made the greatest dole that any man could think, for\nhe was not all only so dolorous for the departing from La Beale Isoud,\nbut he was a part as sorrowful to depart from the fellowship of Sir\nTristram; for Sir Tristram was so kind and so gentle that when Sir\nPalomides remembered him thereof he might never be merry.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXI. How Sir Bleoberis and Sir Ector reported to Queen\nGuenever of the beauty of La Beale Isoud.\n\n\nSO at the seven nights' end Sir Bleoberis and Sir Ector departed from\nSir Tristram and from the queen; and these two good knights had great\ngifts; and Sir Gareth and Sir Dinadan abode with Sir Tristram. And when\nSir Bleoberis and Sir Ector were come there as the Queen Guenever was\nlodged, in a castle by the seaside, and through the grace of God the\nqueen was recovered of her malady, then she asked the two knights from\nwhence they came. They said that they came from Sir Tristram and from La\nBeale Isoud. How doth Sir Tristram, said the queen, and La Beale Isoud?\nTruly, said those two knights, he doth as a noble knight should do; and\nas for the Queen Isoud, she is peerless of all ladies; for to speak of\nher beauty, bount\u00e9, and mirth, and of her goodness, we saw never her\nmatch as far as we have ridden and gone. O mercy Jesu, said Queen\nGuenever, so saith all the people that have seen her and spoken with\nher. God would that I had part of her conditions; and it is misfortuned\nme of my sickness while that tournament endured. And as I suppose I\nshall never see in all my life such an assembly of knights and ladies as\nye have done.\n\nThen the knights told her how Palomides won the degree at the first day\nwith great noblesse; and the second day Sir Tristram won the degree; and\nthe third day Sir Launcelot won the degree. Well, said Queen Guenever,\nwho did best all these three days? So God me help, said these knights,\nSir Launcelot and Sir Tristram had least dishonour. And wit ye well Sir\nPalomides did passing well and mightily; but he turned against the party\nthat he came in withal, and that caused him to lose a great part of his\nworship, for it seemed that Sir Palomides is passing envious. Then shall\nhe never win worship, said Queen Guenever, for an it happeth an envious\nman once to win worship he shall be dishonoured twice therefore; and for\nthis cause all men of worship hate an envious man, and will shew him no\nfavour, and he that is courteous, and kind, and gentle, hath favour in\nevery place.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXII. How Epinogris complained by a well, and how Sir\nPalomides came and found him, and of their both sorrowing.\n\n\nNOW leave we of this matter and speak we of Sir Palomides, that rode and\nlodged him with the two kings, whereof the kings were heavy. Then the\nKing of Ireland sent a man of his to Sir Palomides, and gave him a great\ncourser, and the King of Scotland gave him great gifts; and fain they\nwould have had Sir Palomides to have abiden with them, but in no wise he\nwould abide; and so he departed, and rode as adventures would guide him,\ntill it was nigh noon. And then in a forest by a well Sir Palomides saw\nwhere lay a fair wounded knight and his horse bounden by him; and that\nknight made the greatest dole that ever he heard man make, for ever he\nwept, and therewith he sighed as though he would die. Then Sir Palomides\nrode near him and saluted him mildly and said: Fair knight, why wail\nye so? let me lie down and wail with you, for doubt not I am much more\nheavier than ye are; for I dare say, said Palomides, that my sorrow is\nan hundred fold more than yours is, and therefore let us complain either\nto other. First, said the wounded knight, I require you tell me your\nname, for an thou be none of the noble knights of the Round Table thou\nshalt never know my name, whatsomever come of me. Fair knight, said\nPalomides, such as I am, be it better or be it worse, wit thou well\nthat my name is Sir Palomides, son and heir unto King Astlabor, and Sir\nSafere and Sir Segwarides are my two brethren; and wit thou well as for\nmyself I was never christened, but my two brethren are truly christened.\nO noble knight, said that knight, well is me that I have met with you;\nand wit ye well my name is Epinogris, the king's son of Northumberland.\nNow sit down, said Epinogris, and let us either complain to other.\n\nThen Sir Palomides began his complaint. Now shall I tell you, said\nPalomides, what woe I endure. I love the fairest queen and lady that\never bare life, and wit ye well her name is La Beale Isoud, King Mark's\nwife of Cornwall. That is great folly, said Epinogris, for to love Queen\nIsoud, for one of the best knights of the world loveth her, that is Sir\nTristram de Liones. That is truth, said Palomides, for no man knoweth\nthat matter better than I do, for I have been in Sir Tristram's\nfellowship this month, and with La Beale Isoud together; and alas, said\nPalomides, unhappy man that I am, now have I lost the fellowship of Sir\nTristram for ever, and the love of La Beale Isoud for ever, and I am\nnever like to see her more, and Sir Tristram and I be either to other\nmortal enemies. Well, said Epinogris, sith that ye loved La Beale Isoud,\nloved she you ever again by anything that ye could think or wit, or else\ndid ye rejoice her ever in any pleasure? Nay, by my knighthood, said\nPalomides, I never espied that ever she loved me more than all the\nworld, nor never had I pleasure with her, but the last day she gave me\nthe greatest rebuke that ever I had, the which shall never go from my\nheart. And yet I well deserved that rebuke, for I did not knightly, and\ntherefore I have lost the love of her and of Sir Tristram for ever; and\nI have many times enforced myself to do many deeds for La Beale Isoud's\nsake, and she was the causer of my worship-winning. Alas, said Sir\nPalomides, now have I lost all the worship that ever I won, for never\nshall me befall such prowess as I had in the fellowship of Sir Tristram.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXIII. How Sir Palomides brought Sir Epinogris his lady; and\nhow Sir Palomides and Sir Safere were assailed.\n\n\nNAY, nay, said Epinogris, your sorrow is but japes to my sorrow; for\nI rejoiced my lady and won her with my hands, and lost her again: alas\nthat day! Thus first I won her, said Epinogris; my lady was an earl's\ndaughter, and as the earl and two knights came from the tournament of\nLonazep, for her sake I set upon this earl and on his two knights, my\nlady there being present; and so by fortune there I slew the earl and\none of the knights, and the other knight fled, and so that night I had\nmy lady. And on the morn as she and I reposed us at this well-side there\ncame there to me an errant knight, his name was Sir Helior le Preuse,\nan hardy knight, and this Sir Helior challenged me to fight for my lady.\nAnd then we went to battle first upon horse and after on foot, but at\nthe last Sir Helior wounded me so that he left me for dead, and so he\ntook my lady with him; and thus my sorrow is more than yours, for I have\nrejoiced and ye rejoiced never. That is truth, said Palomides, but sith\nI can never recover myself I shall promise you if I can meet with Sir\nHelior I shall get you your lady again, or else he shall beat me.\n\nThen Sir Palomides made Sir Epinogris to take his horse, and so they\nrode to an hermitage, and there Sir Epinogris rested him. And in the\nmeanwhile Sir Palomides walked privily out to rest him under the leaves,\nand there beside he saw a knight come riding with a shield that he had\nseen Sir Ector de Maris bear beforehand; and there came after him a ten\nknights, and so these ten knights hoved under the leaves for heat. And\nanon after there came a knight with a green shield and therein a white\nlion, leading a lady upon a palfrey. Then this knight with the green\nshield that seemed to be master of the ten knights, he rode fiercely\nafter Sir Helior, for it was he that hurt Sir Epinogris. And when he\ncame nigh Sir Helior he bade him defend his lady. I will defend her,\nsaid Helior, unto my power. And so they ran together so mightily that\neither of these knights smote other down, horse and all, to the earth;\nand then they won up lightly and drew their swords and their shields,\nand lashed together mightily more than an hour. All this Sir Palomides\nsaw and beheld, but ever at the last the knight with Sir Ector's shield\nwas bigger, and at the last this knight smote Sir Helior down, and then\nthat knight unlaced his helm to have stricken off his head. And then\nhe cried mercy, and prayed him to save his life, and bade him take his\nlady. Then Sir Palomides dressed him up, because he wist well that that\nsame lady was Epinogris' lady, and he promised him to help him.\n\nThen Sir Palomides went straight to that lady, and took her by the hand,\nand asked her whether she knew a knight that hight Epinogris. Alas, she\nsaid, that ever he knew me or I him, for I have for his sake lost my\nworship, and also his life grieveth me most of all. Not so, lady, said\nPalomides, come on with me, for here is Epinogris in this hermitage. Ah!\nwell is me, said the lady, an he be alive. Whither wilt thou with that\nlady? said the knight with Sir Ector's shield. I will do with her what\nme list, said Palomides. Wit you well, said that knight, thou speakest\nover large, though thou seemest me to have at advantage, because thou\nsawest me do battle but late. Thou weenest, sir knight, to have that\nlady away from me so lightly? nay, think it never not; an thou were\nas good a knight as is Sir Launcelot, or as is Sir Tristram, or Sir\nPalomides, but thou shalt win her dearer than ever did I. And so they\nwent unto battle upon foot, and there they gave many sad strokes, and\neither wounded other passing sore, and thus they fought still more than\nan hour.\n\nThen Sir Palomides had marvel what knight he might be that was so strong\nand so well breathed during, and thus said Palomides: Knight, I require\nthee tell me thy name. Wit thou well, said that knight, I dare tell thee\nmy name, so that thou wilt tell me thy name. I will, said Palomides.\nTruly, said that knight, my name is Safere, son of King Astlabor, and\nSir Palomides and Sir Segwarides are my brethren. Now, and wit thou\nwell, my name is Sir Palomides. Then Sir Safere kneeled down upon his\nknees, and prayed him of mercy; and then they unlaced their helms and\neither kissed other weeping. And in the meanwhile Sir Epinogris arose\nout of his bed, and heard them by the strokes, and so he armed him to\nhelp Sir Palomides if need were.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXIV. How Sir Palomides and Sir Safere conducted Sir Epinogris\nto his castle, and of other adventures.\n\n\nTHEN Sir Palomides took the lady by the hand and brought her to Sir\nEpinogris, and there was great joy betwixt them, for either swooned for\njoy. When they were met: Fair knight and lady, said Sir Safere, it were\npity to depart you; Jesu send you joy either of other. Gramercy,\ngentle knight, said Epinogris; and much more thanks be to my lord Sir\nPalomides, that thus hath through his prowess made me to get my lady.\nThen Sir Epinogris required Sir Palomides and Sir Safere, his brother,\nto ride with them unto his castle, for the safeguard of his person. Sir,\nsaid Palomides, we will be ready to conduct you because that ye are sore\nwounded; and so was Epinogris and his lady horsed, and his lady behind\nhim upon a soft ambler. And then they rode unto his castle, where they\nhad great cheer and joy, as great as ever Sir Palomides and Sir Safere\nhad in their life-days.\n\nSo on the morn Sir Safere and Sir Palomides departed, day until after\nnoon. And at the last they heard a great weeping and a great noise down\nin a manor. Sir, said then Sir Safere, let us wit what noise this is.\nI will well, said Sir Palomides. And so they rode forth till that they\ncame to a fair gate of a manor, and there sat an old man saying his\nprayers and beads. Then Sir Palomides and Sir Safere alighted and left\ntheir horses, and went within the gates, and there they saw full many\ngoodly men weeping. Fair sirs, said Palomides, wherefore weep ye and\nmake this sorrow? Anon one of the knights of the castle beheld Sir\nPalomides and knew him, and then went to his fellows and said: Fair\nfellows, wit ye well all, we have in this castle the same knight that\nslew our lord at Lonazep, for I know him well; it is Sir Palomides. Then\nthey went unto harness, all that might bear harness, some on horseback\nand some on foot, to the number of three score. And when they were ready\nthey came freshly upon Sir Palomides and upon Sir Safere with a great\nnoise, and said thus: Keep thee, Sir Palomides, for thou art known, and\nby right thou must be dead, for thou hast slain our lord; and therefore\nwit ye well we will slay thee, therefore defend thee.\n\nThen Sir Palomides and Sir Safere, the one set his back to the other,\nand gave many great strokes, and took many great strokes; and thus they\nfought with a twenty knights and forty gentlemen and yeomen nigh two\nhours. But at the last though they were loath, Sir Palomides and Sir\nSafere were taken and yolden, and put in a strong prison; and within\nthree days twelve knights passed upon them, and they found Sir Palomides\nguilty, and Sir Safere not guilty, of their lord's death. And when Sir\nSafere should be delivered there was great dole betwixt Sir Palomides\nand him, and many piteous complaints that Sir Safere made at his\ndeparting, there is no maker can rehearse the tenth part. Fair brother,\nsaid Palomides, let be thy dolour and thy sorrow. And if I be ordained\nto die a shameful death, welcome be it; but an I had wist of this death\nthat I am deemed unto, I should never have been yolden. So Sir Safere\ndeparted from his brother with the greatest dolour and sorrow that ever\nmade knight.\n\nAnd on the morn they of the castle ordained twelve knights to ride with\nSir Palomides unto the father of the same knight that Sir Palomides\nslew; and so they bound his legs under an old steed's belly. And then\nthey rode with Sir Palomides unto a castle by the seaside, that hight\nPelownes, and there Sir Palomides should have justice. Thus was their\nordinance; and so they rode with Sir Palomides fast by the castle of\nJoyous Gard. And as they passed by that castle there came riding out of\nthat castle by them one that knew Sir Palomides. And when that knight\nsaw Sir Palomides bounden upon a crooked courser, the knight asked Sir\nPalomides for what cause he was led so. Ah, my fair fellow and knight,\nsaid Palomides, I ride toward my death for the slaying of a knight at\na tournament of Lonazep; and if I had not departed from my lord Sir\nTristram, as I ought not to have done, now might I have been sure to\nhave had my life saved; but I pray you, sir knight, recommend me unto\nmy lord, Sir Tristram, and unto my lady, Queen Isoud, and say to them if\never I trespassed to them I ask them forgiveness. And also I beseech you\nrecommend me unto my lord, King Arthur, and to all the fellowship of\nthe Round Table, unto my power. Then that knight wept for pity of Sir\nPalomides; and therewithal he rode unto Joyous Gard as fast as his horse\nmight run, and lightly that knight descended down off his horse and went\nunto Sir Tristram, and there he told him all as ye have heard, and ever\nthe knight wept as he had been mad.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXV. How Sir Tristram made him ready to rescue Sir Palomides,\nbut Sir Launcelot rescued him or he came.\n\n\nWHEN Sir Tristram heard how Sir Palomides went to his death, he\nwas heavy to hear that, and said: Howbeit that I am wroth with Sir\nPalomides, yet will not I suffer him to die so shameful a death, for he\nis a full noble knight. And then anon Sir Tristram was armed and took\nhis horse and two squires with him, and rode a great pace toward the\ncastle of Pelownes where Sir Palomides was judged to death. And these\ntwelve knights that led Sir Palomides passed by a well whereas Sir\nLauncelot was, which was alighted there, and had tied his horse to a\ntree, and taken off his helm to drink of that well; and when he saw\nthese knights, Sir Launcelot put on his helm and suffered them to\npass by him. And then was he ware of Sir Palomides bounden, and led\nshamefully to his death. O Jesu, said Launcelot, what misadventure\nis befallen him that he is thus led toward his death? Forsooth, said\nLauncelot, it were shame to me to suffer this noble knight so to die an\nI might help him, therefore I will help him whatsomever come of it, or\nelse I shall die for Sir Palomides' sake. And then Sir Launcelot mounted\nupon his horse, and gat his spear in his hand, and rode after the\ntwelve knights that led Sir Palomides. Fair knights, said Sir Launcelot,\nwhither lead ye that knight? it beseemeth him full ill to ride bounden.\nThen these twelve knights suddenly turned their horses and said to Sir\nLauncelot: Sir knight, we counsel thee not to meddle with this knight,\nfor he hath deserved death, and unto death he is judged. That me\nrepenteth, said Launcelot, that I may not borrow him with fairness, for\nhe is over good a knight to die such a shameful death. And therefore,\nfair knights, said Sir Launcelot, keep you as well as ye can, for I will\nrescue that knight or die for it.\n\nThen they began to dress their spears, and Sir Launcelot smote the\nforemost down, horse and man, and so he served three more with one\nspear; and then that spear brast, and therewithal Sir Launcelot drew his\nsword, and then he smote on the right hand and on the left hand. Then\nwithin a while he left none of those twelve knights, but he had laid\nthem to the earth, and the most part of them were sore wounded. And\nthen Sir Launcelot took the best horse that he found, and loosed Sir\nPalomides and set him upon that horse; and so they returned again unto\nJoyous Gard, and then was Sir Palomides ware of Sir Tristram how he\ncame riding. And when Sir Launcelot saw him he knew him well, but Sir\nTristram knew him not because Sir Launcelot had on his shoulder a golden\nshield. So Sir Launcelot made him ready to joust with Sir Tristram,\nthat Sir Tristram should not ween that he were Sir Launcelot. Then Sir\nPalomides cried aloud to Sir Tristram: O my lord, I require you joust\nnot with this knight, for this good knight hath saved me from my death.\nWhen Sir Tristram heard him say so he came a soft trotting pace toward\nthem. And then Sir Palomides said: My lord, Sir Tristram, much am I\nbeholding unto you of your great goodness, that would proffer your\nnoble body to rescue me undeserved, for I have greatly offended you.\nNotwithstanding, said Sir Palomides, here met we with this noble knight\nthat worshipfully and manly rescued me from twelve knights, and smote\nthem down all and wounded them sore.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXVI. How Sir Tristram and Launcelot, with Palomides, came to\njoyous Gard; and of Palomides and Sir Tristram.\n\n\nFAIR knight, said Sir Tristram unto Sir Launcelot, of whence be ye? I\nam a knight errant, said Sir Launcelot, that rideth to seek many\nadventures. What is your name? said Sir Tristram. Sir, at this time\nI will not tell you. Then Sir Launcelot said unto Sir Tristram and to\nPalomides: Now either of you are met together I will depart from you.\nNot so, said Sir Tristram; I pray you of knighthood to ride with me unto\nmy castle. Wit you well, said Sir Launcelot, I may not ride with you,\nfor I have many deeds to do in other places, that at this time I may not\nabide with you. Ah, mercy Jesu, said Sir Tristram, I require you as\nye be a true knight to the order of knighthood, play you with me this\nnight. Then Sir Tristram had a grant of Sir Launcelot: howbeit though\nhe had not desired him he would have ridden with them, outher soon have\ncome after them; for Sir Launcelot came for none other cause into that\ncountry but for to see Sir Tristram. And when they were come within\nJoyous Gard they alighted, and their horses were led into a stable;\nand then they unarmed them. And when Sir Launcelot was unhelmed,\nSir Tristram and Sir Palomides knew him. Then Sir Tristram took Sir\nLauncelot in arms, and so did La Beale Isoud; and Palomides kneeled down\nupon his knees and thanked Sir Launcelot. When Sir Launcelot saw Sir\nPalomides kneel he lightly took him up and said thus: Wit thou well, Sir\nPalomides, I and any knight in this land, of worship ought of very right\nsuccour and rescue so noble a knight as ye are proved and renowned,\nthroughout all this realm endlong and overthwart. And then was there joy\namong them, and the oftener that Sir Palomides saw La Beale Isoud the\nheavier he waxed day by day.\n\nThen Sir Launcelot within three or four days departed, and with him rode\nSir Ector de Maris; and Dinadan and Sir Palomides were there left with\nSir Tristram a two months and more. But ever Sir Palomides faded and\nmourned, that all men had marvel wherefore he faded so away. So upon\na day, in the dawning, Sir Palomides went into the forest by himself\nalone; and there he found a well, and then he looked into the well, and\nin the water he saw his own visage, how he was disturbed and defaded,\nnothing like that he was. What may this mean? said Sir Palomides, and\nthus he said to himself: Ah, Palomides, Palomides, why art thou defaded,\nthou that was wont to be called one of the fairest knights of the world?\nI will no more lead this life, for I love that I may never get nor\nrecover. And therewithal he laid him down by the well. And then he began\nto make a rhyme of La Beale Isoud and him.\n\nAnd in the meanwhile Sir Tristram was that same day ridden into the\nforest to chase the hart of greese; but Sir Tristram would not ride\na-hunting never more unarmed, because of Sir Breuse Saunce Pit\u00e9. And\nso as Sir Tristram rode into that forest up and down, he heard one sing\nmarvellously loud, and that was Sir Palomides that lay by the well.\nAnd then Sir Tristram rode softly thither, for he deemed there was some\nknight errant that was at the well. And when Sir Tristram came nigh him\nhe descended down from his horse and tied his horse fast till a tree,\nand then he came near him on foot; and anon he was ware where lay Sir\nPalomides by the well and sang loud and merrily; and ever the complaints\nwere of that noble queen, La Beale Isoud, the which was marvellously and\nwonderfully well said, and full dolefully and piteously made. And all\nthe whole song the noble knight, Sir Tristram, heard from the beginning\nto the ending, the which grieved and troubled him sore.\n\nBut then at the last, when Sir Tristram had heard all Sir Palomides'\ncomplaints, he was wroth out of measure, and thought for to slay him\nthereas he lay. Then Sir Tristram remembered himself that Sir Palomides\nwas unarmed, and of the noble name that Sir Palomides had, and the noble\nname that himself had, and then he made a restraint of his anger; and so\nhe went unto Sir Palomides a soft pace and said: Sir Palomides, I have\nheard your complaint, and of thy treason that thou hast owed me so long,\nand wit thou well therefore thou shalt die; and if it were not for shame\nof knighthood thou shouldest not escape my hands, for now I know well\nthou hast awaited me with treason. Tell me, said Sir Tristram, how thou\nwilt acquit thee? Sir, said Palomides, thus I will acquit me: as for\nQueen La Beale Isoud, ye shall wit well that I love her above all other\nladies in this world; and well I wot it shall befall me as for her love\nas befell to the noble knight Sir Kehydius, that died for the love of La\nBeale Isoud. And now, Sir Tristram, I will that ye wit that I have loved\nLa Beale Isoud many a day, and she hath been the causer of my worship,\nand else I had been the most simplest knight in the world. For by her,\nand because of her, I have won the worship that I have; for when I\nremembered me of La Beale Isoud I won the worship wheresomever I came\nfor the most part; and yet had I never reward nor bount\u00e9 of her the days\nof my life, and yet have I been her knight guerdonless. And therefore,\nSir Tristram, as for any death I dread not, for I had as lief die as to\nlive. And if I were armed as thou art, I should lightly do battle with\nthee. Well have ye uttered your treason, said Tristram. I have done to\nyou no treason, said Palomides, for love is free for all men, and though\nI have loved your lady, she is my lady as well as yours; howbeit I have\nwrong if any wrong be, for ye rejoice her, and have your desire of her,\nand so had I never nor never am like to have, and yet shall I love her\nto the uttermost days of my life as well as ye.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXVII. How there was a day set between Sir Tristram and Sir\nPalomides for to fight, and how Sir Tristram was hurt.\n\n\nTHEN said Sir Tristram: I will fight with you to the uttermost. I grant,\nsaid Palomides, for in a better quarrel keep I never to fight, for an\nI die of your hands, of a better knight's hands may I not be slain. And\nsithen I understand that I shall never rejoice La Beale Isoud, I have as\ngood will to die as to live. Then set ye a day, said Sir Tristram, that\nwe shall do battle. This day fifteen days, said Palomides, will I meet\nwith you hereby, in the meadow under Joyous Gard. Fie for shame, said\nSir Tristram, will ye set so long day? let us fight to-morn. Not so,\nsaid Palomides, for I am meagre, and have been long sick for the love of\nLa Beale Isoud, and therefore I will repose me till I have my strength\nagain. So then Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides promised faith fully\nto meet at the well that day fifteen days. I am remembered, said Sir\nTristram to Palomides, that ye brake me once a promise when that I\nrescued you from Breuse Saunce Pit\u00e9 and nine knights; and then ye\npromised me to meet me at the peron and the grave beside Camelot,\nwhereas at that time ye failed of your promise. Wit you well, said\nPalomides unto Sir Tristram, I was at that day in prison, so that I\nmight not hold my promise. So God me help, said Sir Tristram, an ye had\nholden your promise this work had not been here now at this time.\n\nRight so departed Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides. And so Sir Palomides\ntook his horse and his harness, and he rode unto King Arthur's court;\nand there Sir Palomides gat him four knights and four sergeants-of-arms,\nand so he returned againward unto Joyous Gard. And in the meanwhile Sir\nTristram chased and hunted at all manner of venery; and about three days\nafore the battle should be, as Sir Tristram chased an hart, there was an\narcher shot at the hart, and by misfortune he smote Sir Tristram in the\nthick of the thigh, and the arrow slew Sir Tristram's horse and hurt\nhim. When Sir Tristram was so hurt he was passing heavy, and wit ye well\nhe bled sore; and then he took another horse, and rode unto Joyous Gard\nwith great heaviness, more for the promise that he had made with Sir\nPalomides, as to do battle with him within three days after, than for\nany hurt of his thigh. Wherefore there was neither man nor woman that\ncould cheer him with anything that they could make to him, neither Queen\nLa Beale Isoud; for ever he deemed that Sir Palomides had smitten him so\nthat he should not be able to do battle with him at the day set.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXVIII. How Sir Palomides kept his day to have foughten, but\nSir Tristram might not come; and other things.\n\n\nBUT in no wise there was no knight about Sir Tristram that would believe\nthat ever Sir Palomides would hurt Sir Tristram, neither by his own\nhands nor by none other consenting. Then when the fifteenth day was\ncome, Sir Palomides came to the well with four knights with him of\nArthur's court, and three sergeants-of-arms. And for this intent Sir\nPalomides brought the knights with him and the sergeants-of-arms, for\nthey should bear record of the battle betwixt Sir Tristram and Sir\nPalomides. And the one sergeant brought in his helm, the other his\nspear, the third his sword. So thus Palomides came into the field,\nand there he abode nigh two hours; and then he sent a squire unto Sir\nTristram, and desired him to come into the field to hold his promise.\n\nWhen the squire was come to Joyous Gard, anon as Sir Tristram heard of\nhis coming he let command that the squire should come to his presence\nthereas he lay in his bed. My lord Sir Tristram, said Palomides' squire,\nwit you well my lord, Palomides, abideth you in the field, and he would\nwit whether ye would do battle or not. Ah, my fair brother, said\nSir Tristram, wit thou well that I am right heavy for these tidings;\ntherefore tell Sir Palomides an I were well at ease I would not lie\nhere, nor he should have no need to send for me an I might either ride\nor go; and for thou shalt say that I am no liar--Sir Tristram showed him\nhis thigh that the wound was six inches deep. And now thou hast seen my\nhurt, tell thy lord that this is no feigned matter, and tell him that I\nhad liefer than all the gold of King Arthur that I were whole; and tell\nPalomides as soon as I am whole I shall seek him endlong and overthwart,\nand that I promise you as I am true knight; and if ever I may meet\nwith him, he shall have battle of me his fill. And with this the squire\ndeparted; and when Palomides wist that Tristram was hurt he was glad and\nsaid: Now I am sure I shall have no shame, for I wot well I should have\nhad hard handling of him, and by likely I must needs have had the worse,\nfor he is the hardest knight in battle that now is living except Sir\nLauncelot.\n\nAnd then departed Sir Palomides whereas fortune led him, and within a\nmonth Sir Tristram was whole of his hurt. And then he took his horse,\nand rode from country to country, and all strange adventures he achieved\nwheresomever he rode; and always he enquired for Sir Palomides, but\nof all that quarter of summer Sir Tristram could never meet with Sir\nPalomides. But thus as Sir Tristram sought and enquired after Sir\nPalomides Sir Tristram achieved many great battles, wherethrough all\nthe noise fell to Sir Tristram, and it ceased of Sir Launcelot; and\ntherefore Sir Launcelot's brethren and his kinsmen would have slain\nSir Tristram because of his fame. But when Sir Launcelot wist how his\nkinsmen were set, he said to them openly: Wit you well, that an the\nenvy of you all be so hardy to wait upon my lord, Sir Tristram, with any\nhurt, shame, or villainy, as I am true knight I shall slay the best of\nyou with mine own hands Alas, fie for shame, should ye for his noble\ndeeds await upon him to slay him. Jesu defend, said Launcelot, that ever\nany noble knight as Sir Tristram is should be destroyed with treason.\nOf this noise and fame sprang into Cornwall, and among them of Liones,\nwhereof they were passing glad, and made great joy. And then they of\nLiones sent letters unto Sir Tristram of recommendation, and many great\ngifts to maintain Sir Tristram's estate; and ever, between, Sir Tristram\nresorted unto Joyous Gard whereas La Beale Isoud was, that loved him as\nher life.\n\n_Here endeth the tenth book which is of Sir Tristram. And here followeth\nthe eleventh book which is of Sir Launcelot._\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XI.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. How Sir Launcelot rode on his adventure, and how he holp a\ndolorous lady from her pain, and how that he fought with a dragon.\n\n\nNOW leave we Sir Tristram de Liones, and speak we of Sir Launcelot du\nLake, and of Sir Galahad, Sir Launcelot's son, how he was gotten, and in\nwhat manner, as the book of French rehearseth. Afore the time that Sir\nGalahad was gotten or born, there came in an hermit unto King Arthur\nupon Whitsunday, as the knights sat at the Table Round. And when the\nhermit saw the Siege Perilous, he asked the king and all the knights\nwhy that siege was void. Sir Arthur and all the knights answered: There\nshall never none sit in that siege but one, but if he be destroyed.\nThen said the hermit: Wot ye what is he? Nay, said Arthur and all the\nknights, we wot not who is he that shall sit therein. Then wot I, said\nthe hermit, for he that shall sit there is unborn and ungotten, and\nthis same year he shall be gotten that shall sit there in that Siege\nPerilous, and he shall win the Sangreal. When this hermit had made this\nmention he departed from the court of King Arthur.\n\nAnd then after this feast Sir Launcelot rode on his adventure, till on\na time by adventure he passed over the pont of Corbin; and there he saw\nthe fairest tower that ever he saw, and there-under was a fair town full\nof people; and all the people, men and women, cried at once: Welcome,\nSir Launcelot du Lake, the flower of all knighthood, for by thee all we\nshall be holpen out of danger. What mean ye, said Sir Launcelot, that\nye cry so upon me? Ah, fair knight, said they all, here is within this\ntower a dolorous lady that hath been there in pains many winters and\ndays, for ever she boileth in scalding water; and but late, said all the\npeople, Sir Gawaine was here and he might not help her, and so he left\nher in pain. So may I, said Sir Launcelot, leave her in pain as well\nas Sir Gawaine did. Nay, said the people, we know well that it is Sir\nLauncelot that shall deliver her. Well, said Launcelot, then shew me\nwhat I shall do.\n\nThen they brought Sir Launcelot into the tower; and when he came to the\nchamber thereas this lady was, the doors of iron unlocked and unbolted.\nAnd so Sir Launcelot went into the chamber that was as hot as any stew.\nAnd there Sir Launcelot took the fairest lady by the hand that ever he\nsaw, and she was naked as a needle; and by enchantment Queen Morgan le\nFay and the Queen of Northgalis had put her there in that pains, because\nshe was called the fairest lady of that country; and there she had been\nfive years, and never might she be delivered out of her great pains unto\nthe time the best knight of the world had taken her by the hand. Then\nthe people brought her clothes. And when she was arrayed, Sir Launcelot\nthought she was the fairest lady of the world, but if it were Queen\nGuenever.\n\nThen this lady said to Sir Launcelot: Sir, if it please you will ye go\nwith me hereby into a chapel that we may give loving and thanking unto\nGod? Madam, said Sir Launcelot, come on with me, I will go with you.\nSo when they came there and gave thankings to God all the people, both\nlearned and lewd, gave thankings unto God and him, and said: Sir knight,\nsince ye have delivered this lady, ye shall deliver us from a serpent\nthere is here in a tomb. Then Sir Launcelot took his shield and said:\nBring me thither, and what I may do unto the pleasure of God and you I\nwill do. So when Sir Launcelot came thither he saw written upon the\ntomb letters of gold that said thus: Here shall come a leopard of king's\nblood, and he shall slay this serpent, and this leopard shall engender\na lion in this foreign country, the which lion shall pass all other\nknights. So then Sir Launcelot lift up the tomb, and there came out an\nhorrible and a fiendly dragon, spitting fire out of his mouth. Then Sir\nLauncelot drew his sword and fought with the dragon long, and at the\nlast with great pain Sir Launcelot slew that dragon. Therewithal came\nKing Pelles, the good and noble knight, and saluted Sir Launcelot, and\nhe him again. Fair knight, said the king, what is your name? I require\nyou of your knighthood tell me!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. How Sir Launcelot came to Pelles, and of the Sangreal, and\nof Elaine, King Pelles' daughter.\n\n\nSIR, said Launcelot, wit you well my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake.\nAnd my name is, said the king, Pelles, king of the foreign country, and\ncousin nigh unto Joseph of Armathie. And then either of them made much\nof other, and so they went into the castle to take their repast. And\nanon there came in a dove at a window, and in her mouth there seemed a\nlittle censer of gold. And herewithal there was such a savour as all the\nspicery of the world had been there. And forthwithal there was upon the\ntable all manner of meats and drinks that they could think upon. So\ncame in a damosel passing fair and young, and she bare a vessel of gold\nbetwixt her hands; and thereto the king kneeled devoutly, and said his\nprayers, and so did all that were there. O Jesu, said Sir Launcelot,\nwhat may this mean? This is, said the king, the richest thing that any\nman hath living. And when this thing goeth about, the Round Table shall\nbe broken; and wit thou well, said the king, this is the holy Sangreal\nthat ye have here seen. So the king and Sir Launcelot led their life the\nmost part of that day. And fain would King Pelles have found the mean\nto have had Sir Launcelot to have lain by his daughter, fair Elaine.\nAnd for this intent: the king knew well that Sir Launcelot should get a\nchild upon his daughter, the which should be named Sir Galahad the good\nknight, by whom all the foreign country should be brought out of danger,\nand by him the Holy Greal should be achieved.\n\nThen came forth a lady that hight Dame Brisen, and she said unto the\nking: Sir, wit ye well Sir Launcelot loveth no lady in the world but all\nonly Queen Guenever; and therefore work ye by counsel, and I shall make\nhim to lie with your daughter, and he shall not wit but that he lieth\nwith Queen Guenever. O fair lady, Dame Brisen, said the king, hope ye to\nbring this about? Sir, said she, upon pain of my life let me deal; for\nthis Brisen was one of the greatest enchantresses that was at that time\nin the world living. Then anon by Dame Brisen's wit she made one to come\nto Sir Launcelot that he knew well. And this man brought him a ring from\nQueen Guenever like as it had come from her, and such one as she was\nwont for the most part to wear; and when Sir Launcelot saw that token\nwit ye well he was never so fain. Where is my lady? said Sir Launcelot.\nIn the Castle of Case, said the messenger, but five mile hence. Then Sir\nLauncelot thought to be there the same might. And then this Brisen\nby the commandment of King Pelles let send Elaine to this castle with\ntwenty-five knights unto the Castle of Case. Then Sir Launcelot against\nnight rode unto that castle, and there anon he was received worshipfully\nwith such people, to his seeming, as were about Queen Guenever secret.\n\nSo when Sir Launcelot was alighted, he asked where the queen was. So\nDame Brisen said she was in her bed; and then the people were avoided,\nand Sir Launcelot was led unto his chamber. And then Dame Brisen brought\nSir Launcelot a cup full of wine; and anon as he had drunken that wine\nhe was so assotted and mad that he might make no delay, but withouten\nany let he went to bed; and he weened that maiden Elaine had been Queen\nGuenever. Wit you well that Sir Launcelot was glad, and so was that lady\nElaine that she had gotten Sir Launcelot in her arms. For well she knew\nthat same night should be gotten upon her Galahad that should prove the\nbest knight of the world; and so they lay together until underne of the'\nmorn; and all the windows and holes of that chamber were stopped that no\nmanner of day might be seen. And then Sir Launcelot remembered him, and\nhe arose up and went to the window.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. How Sir Launcelot was displeased when he knew that he had\nlain by Dame Elaine, and how she was delivered of Galahad.\n\n\nAND anon as he had unshut the window the enchantment was gone; then he\nknew himself that he had done amiss. Alas, he said, that I have lived\nso long; now I am shamed. So then he gat his sword in his hand and said:\nThou traitress, what art thou that I have lain by all this night? thou\nshalt die right here of my hands. Then this fair lady Elaine skipped out\nof her bed all naked, and kneeled down afore Sir Launcelot, and said:\nFair courteous knight, come of king's blood, I require you have mercy\nupon me, and as thou art renowned the most noble knight of the world,\nslay me not, for I have in my womb him by thee that shall be the most\nnoblest knight of the world. Ah, false traitress, said Sir Launcelot,\nwhy hast thou betrayed me? anon tell me what thou art. Sir, she said, I\nam Elaine, the daughter of King Pelles. Well, said Sir Launcelot, I will\nforgive you this deed; and therewith he took her up in his arms, and\nkissed her, for she was as fair a lady, and thereto lusty and young,\nand as wise, as any was that time living. So God me help, said\nSir Launcelot, I may not wite this to you; but her that made this\nenchantment upon me as between you and me, an I may find her, that same\nLady Brisen, she shall lose her head for witchcrafts, for there was\nnever knight deceived so as I am this night. And so Sir Launcelot\narrayed him, and armed him, and took his leave mildly at that lady young\nElaine, and so he departed. Then she said: My lord Sir Launcelot, I\nbeseech you see me as soon as ye may, for I have obeyed me unto the\nprophecy that my father told me. And by his commandment to fulfil this\nprophecy I have given the greatest riches and the fairest flower that\never I had, and that is my maidenhood that I shall never have again; and\ntherefore, gentle knight, owe me your good will.\n\nAnd so Sir Launcelot arrayed him and was armed, and took his leave\nmildly at that young lady Elaine; and so he departed, and rode till he\ncame to the Castle of Corbin, where her father was. And as fast as her\ntime came she was delivered of a fair child, and they christened him\nGalahad; and wit ye well that child was well kept and well nourished,\nand he was named Galahad because Sir Launcelot was so named at the\nfountain stone; and after that the Lady of the Lake confirmed him Sir\nLauncelot du Lake.\n\nThen after this lady was delivered and churched, there came a knight\nunto her, his name was Sir Bromel la Pleche, the which was a great lord;\nand he had loved that lady long, and he evermore desired her to wed her;\nand so by no mean she could put him off, till on a day she said to Sir\nBromel: Wit thou well, sir knight, I will not love you, for my love is\nset upon the best knight of the world. Who is he? said Sir Bromel. Sir,\nshe said, it is Sir Launcelot du Lake that I love and none other, and\ntherefore woo me no longer. Ye say well, said Sir Bromel, and sithen ye\nhave told me so much, ye shall have but little joy of Sir Launcelot, for\nI shall slay him wheresomever I meet him. Sir, said the Lady Elaine, do\nto him no treason. Wit ye well, my lady, said Bromel, and I promise you\nthis twelvemonth I shall keep the pont of Corbin for Sir Launcelot's\nsake, that he shall neither come nor go unto you, but I shall meet with\nhim.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. How Sir Bors came to Dame Elaine and saw Galahad, and how he\nwas fed with the Sangreal.\n\n\nTHEN as it fell by fortune and adventure, Sir Bors de Ganis, that was\nnephew unto Sir Launcelot, came over that bridge; and there Sir Bromel\nand Sir Bors jousted, and Sir Bors smote Sir Bromel such a buffet that\nhe bare him over his horse's croup. And then Sir Bromel, as an hardy\nknight, pulled out his sword, and dressed his shield to do battle with\nSir Bors. And then Sir Bors alighted and avoided his horse, and there\nthey dashed together many sad strokes; and long thus they fought, till\nat the last Sir Bromel was laid to the earth, and there Sir Bors began\nto unlace his helm to slay him. Then Sir Bromel cried Sir Bors mercy,\nand yielded him. Upon this covenant thou shalt have thy life, said Sir\nBors, so thou go unto Sir Launcelot upon Whitsunday that next cometh,\nand yield thee unto him as knight recreant. I will do it, said Sir\nBromel, and that he sware upon the cross of the sword. And so he let him\ndepart, and Sir Bors rode unto King Pelles, that was within Corbin.\n\nAnd when the king and Elaine his daughter wist that Sir Bors was nephew\nunto Sir Launcelot, they made him great cheer. Then said Dame Elaine: We\nmarvel where Sir Launcelot is, for he came never here but once. Marvel\nnot, said Sir Bors, for this half year he hath been in prison with Queen\nMorgan le Fay, King Arthur's sister. Alas, said Dame Elaine, that me\nrepenteth. And ever Sir Bors beheld that child in her arms, and ever\nhim seemed it was passing like Sir Launcelot. Truly, said Elaine, wit\nye well this child he gat upon me. Then Sir Bors wept for joy, and he\nprayed to God it might prove as good a knight as his father was. And so\ncame in a white dove, and she bare a little censer of gold in her mouth,\nand there was all manner of meats and drinks; and a maiden bare that\nSangreal, and she said openly: Wit you well, Sir Bors, that this child\nis Galahad, that shall sit in the Siege Perilous, and achieve the\nSangreal, and he shall be much better than ever was Sir Launcelot du\nLake, that is his own father. And then they kneeled down and made their\ndevotions, and there was such a savour as all the spicery in the world\nhad been there. And when the dove took her flight, the maiden vanished\nwith the Sangreal as she came.\n\nSir, said Sir Bors unto King Pelles, this castle may be named the Castle\nAdventurous, for here be many strange adventures. That is sooth, said\nthe king, for well may this place be called the adventures place, for\nthere come but few knights here that go away with any worship; be he\nnever so strong, here he may be proved; and but late Sir Gawaine, the\ngood knight, gat but little worship here. For I let you wit, said King\nPelles, here shall no knight win no worship but if he be of worship\nhimself and of good living, and that loveth God and dreadeth God, and\nelse he getteth no worship here, be he never so hardy. That is wonderful\nthing, said Sir Bors. What ye mean in this country I wot not, for ye\nhave many strange adventures, and therefore I will lie in this castle\nthis night. Ye shall not do so, said King Pelles, by my counsel, for it\nis hard an ye escape without a shame. I shall take the adventure that\nwill befall me, said Sir Bors. Then I counsel you, said the king, to be\nconfessed clean. As for that, said Sir Bors, I will be shriven with a\ngood will. So Sir Bors was confessed, and for all women Sir Bors was a\nvirgin, save for one, that was the daughter of King Brangoris, and on\nher he gat a child that hight Elaine, and save for her Sir Bors was a\nclean maiden.\n\nAnd so Sir Bors was led unto bed in a fair large chamber, and many doors\nwere shut about the chamber. When Sir Bors espied all those doors, he\navoided all the people, for he might have nobody with him; but in no\nwise Sir Bors would unarm him, but so he laid him down upon the bed. And\nright so he saw come in a light, that he might well see a spear great\nand long that came straight upon him pointling, and to Sir Bors seemed\nthat the head of the spear brent like a taper. And anon, or Sir Bors\nwist, the spear head smote him into the shoulder an hand-breadth in\ndeepness, and that wound grieved Sir Bors passing sore. And then he laid\nhim down again for pain; and anon therewithal there came a knight armed\nwith his shield on his shoulder and his sword in his hand, and he bade\nSir Bors: Arise, sir knight, and fight with me. I am sore hurt, he said,\nbut yet I shall not fail thee. And then Sir Bors started up and dressed\nhis shield; and then they lashed together mightily a great while; and\nat the last Sir Bors bare him backward until that he came unto a chamber\ndoor, and there that knight yede into that chamber and rested him a\ngreat while. And when he had reposed him he came out freshly again, and\nbegan new battle with Sir Bors mightily and strongly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. How Sir Bors made Sir Pedivere to yield him, and of\nmarvellous adventures that he had, and how he achieved them.\n\n\nTHEN Sir Bors thought he should no more go into that chamber to rest\nhim, and so Sir Bors dressed him betwixt the knight and that chamber\ndoor, and there Sir Bors smote him down, and then that knight yielded\nhim What is your name? said Sir Bors. Sir, said he, my name is Pedivere\nof the Straight Marches. So Sir Bors made him to swear at Whitsunday\nnext coming to be at the court of King Arthur, and yield him there as\na prisoner as an overcome knight by the hands of Sir Bors. So thus\ndeparted Sir Pedivere of the Straight Marches. And then Sir Bors laid\nhim down to rest, and then he heard and felt much noise in that chamber;\nand then Sir Bors espied that there came in, he wist not whether at\nthe doors nor windows, shot of arrows and of quarrels so thick that he\nmarvelled, and many fell upon him and hurt him in the bare places.\n\nAnd then Sir Bors was ware where came in an hideous lion; so Sir Bors\ndressed him unto the lion, and anon the lion bereft him his shield, and\nwith his sword Sir Bors smote off the lion's head. Right so Sir Bors\nforthwithal saw a dragon in the court passing horrible, and there seemed\nletters of gold written in his forehead; and Sir Bors thought that the\nletters made a signification of King Arthur. Right so there came an\nhorrible leopard and an old, and there they fought long, and did great\nbattle together. And at the last the dragon spit out of his mouth as it\nhad been an hundred dragons; and lightly all the small dragons slew the\nold dragon and tare him all to pieces.\n\nAnon withal there came an old man into the hall, and he sat him down in\na fair chair, and there seemed to be two adders about his neck; and then\nthe old man had an harp, and there he sang an old song how Joseph of\nArmathie came into this land. Then when he had sung, the old man bade\nSir Bors go from thence. For here shall ye have no more adventures; and\nfull worshipfully have ye done, and better shall ye do hereafter. And\nthen Sir Bors seemed that there came the whitest dove with a little\ngolden censer in her mouth. And anon therewithal the tempest ceased and\npassed, that afore was marvellous to hear. So was all that court full of\ngood savours. Then Sir Bors saw four children bearing four fair tapers,\nand an old man in the midst of the children with a censer in his own\nhand, and a spear in his other hand, and that spear was called the Spear\nof Vengeance.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. How Sir Bors departed; and how Sir Launcelot was rebuked of\nQueen Guenever, and of his excuse.\n\n\nNOW, said that old man to Sir Bors, go ye to your cousin, Sir Launcelot,\nand tell him of this adventure the which had been most convenient for\nhim of all earthly knights; but sin is so foul in him he may not achieve\nsuch holy deeds, for had not been his sin he had passed all the knights\nthat ever were in his days; and tell thou Sir Launcelot, of all worldly\nadventures he passeth in manhood and prowess all other, but in this\nspiritual matters he shall have many his better. And then Sir Bors saw\nfour gentlewomen come by him, purely beseen: and he saw where that they\nentered into a chamber where was great light as it were a summer light;\nand the women kneeled down afore an altar of silver with four pillars,\nand as it had been a bishop kneeled down afore that table of silver.\nAnd as Sir Bors looked over his head he saw a sword like silver, naked,\nhoving over his head, and the clearness thereof smote so in his eyes\nthat as at that time Sir Bors was blind; and there he heard a voice that\nsaid: Go hence, thou Sir Bors, for as yet thou art not worthy for to be\nin this place. And then he yede backward to his bed till on the morn.\nAnd on the morn King Pelles made great joy of Sir Bors; and then he\ndeparted and rode to Camelot, and there he found Sir Launcelot du Lake,\nand told him of the adventures that he had seen with King Pelles at\nCorbin.\n\nSo the noise sprang in Arthur's court that Launcelot had gotten a child\nupon Elaine, the daughter of King Pelles, wherefore Queen Guenever was\nwroth, and gave many rebukes to Sir Launcelot, and called him false\nknight. And then Sir Launcelot told the queen all, and how he was made\nto lie by her by enchantment in likeness of the queen. So the queen held\nSir Launcelot excused. And as the book saith, King Arthur had been in\nFrance, and had made war upon the mighty King Claudas, and had won much\nof his lands. And when the king was come again he let cry a great feast,\nthat all lords and ladies of all England should be there, but if it were\nsuch as were rebellious against him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. How Dame Elaine, Galahad's mother, came in great estate\nunto Camelot, and how Sir Launcelot behaved him there.\n\n\nAND when Dame Elaine, the daughter of King Pelles, heard of this feast\nshe went to her father and required him that he would give her leave to\nride to that feast. The king answered: I will well ye go thither, but in\nany wise as ye love me and will have my blessing, that ye be well beseen\nin the richest wise; and look that ye spare not for no cost; ask and ye\nshall have all that you needeth. Then by the advice of Dame Brisen, her\nmaiden, all thing was apparelled unto the purpose, that there was never\nno lady more richlier beseen. So she rode with twenty knights, and ten\nladies, and gentlewomen, to the number of an hundred horses. And when\nshe came to Camelot, King Arthur and Queen Guenever said, and all the\nknights, that Dame Elaine was the fairest and the best beseen lady that\never was seen in that court. And anon as King Arthur wist that she was\ncome he met her and saluted her, and so did the most part of all the\nknights of the Round Table, both Sir Tristram, Sir Bleoberis, and Sir\nGawaine, and many more that I will not rehearse. But when Sir Launcelot\nsaw her he was so ashamed, and that because he drew his sword on the\nmorn when he had lain by her, that he would not salute her nor speak to\nher; and yet Sir Launcelot thought she was the fairest woman that ever\nhe saw in his life-days.\n\nBut when Dame Elaine saw Sir Launcelot that would not speak unto her she\nwas so heavy that she weened her heart would have to-brast; for wit you\nwell, out of measure she loved him. And then Elaine said unto her woman,\nDame Brisen: the unkindness of Sir Launcelot slayeth me near. Ah, peace,\nmadam, said Dame Brisen, I will undertake that this night he shall lie\nwith you, an ye would hold you still. That were me liefer, said Dame\nElaine, than all the gold that is above the earth. Let me deal, said\nDame Brisen. So when Elaine was brought unto Queen Guenever either made\nother good cheer by countenance, but nothing with hearts. But all men\nand women spake of the beauty of Dame Elaine, and of her great riches.\n\nThen, at night, the queen commanded that Dame Elaine should sleep in a\nchamber nigh her chamber, and all under one roof; and so it was done as\nthe queen commanded. Then the queen sent for Sir Launcelot and bade him\ncome to her chamber that night: Or else I am sure, said the queen, that\nye will go to your lady's bed, Dame Elaine, by whom ye gat Galahad. Ah,\nmadam, said Sir Launcelot, never say ye so, for that I did was against\nmy will. Then, said the queen, look that ye come to me when I send for\nyou. Madam, said Launcelot, I shall not fail you, but I shall be ready\nat your commandment. This bargain was soon done and made between them,\nbut Dame Brisen knew it by her crafts, and told it to her lady, Dame\nElaine. Alas, said she, how shall I do? Let me deal, said Dame Brisen,\nfor I shall bring him by the hand even to your bed, and he shall ween\nthat I am Queen Guenever's messenger. Now well is me, said Dame Elaine,\nfor all the world I love not so much as I do Sir Launcelot.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. How Dame Brisen by enchantment brought Sir Launcelot to\nDame Elaine's bed, and how Queen Guenever rebuked him.\n\n\nSO when time came that all folks were abed, Dame Brisen came to Sir\nLauncelot's bed's side and said: Sir Launcelot du Lake, sleep you? My\nlady, Queen Guenever, lieth and awaiteth upon you. O my fair lady, said\nSir Launcelot, I am ready to go with you where ye will have me. So Sir\nLauncelot threw upon him a long gown, and his sword in his hand; and\nthen Dame Brisen took him by the finger and led him to her lady's bed,\nDame Elaine; and then she departed and left them in bed together. Wit\nyou well the lady was glad, and so was Sir Launcelot, for he weened that\nhe had had another in his arms.\n\nNow leave we them kissing and clipping, as was kindly thing; and\nnow speak we of Queen Guenever that sent one of her women unto Sir\nLauncelot's bed; and when she came there she found the bed cold, and\nhe was away; so she came to the queen and told her all. Alas, said the\nqueen, where is that false knight become? Then the queen was nigh out of\nher wit, and then she writhed and weltered as a mad woman, and might not\nsleep a four or five hours. Then Sir Launcelot had a condition that\nhe used of custom, he would clatter in his sleep, and speak oft of his\nlady, Queen Guenever. So as Sir Launcelot had waked as long as it had\npleased him, then by course of kind he slept, and Dame Elaine both. And\nin his sleep he talked and clattered as a jay, of the love that had been\nbetwixt Queen Guenever and him. And so as he talked so loud the queen\nheard him thereas she lay in her chamber; and when she heard him so\nclatter she was nigh wood and out of her mind, and for anger and pain\nwist not what to do. And then she coughed so loud that Sir Launcelot\nawaked, and he knew her hemming. And then he knew well that he lay not\nby the queen; and therewith he leapt out of his bed as he had been a\nwood man, in his shirt, and the queen met him in the floor; and thus she\nsaid: False traitor knight that thou art, look thou never abide in my\ncourt, and avoid my chamber, and not so hardy, thou false traitor\nknight that thou art, that ever thou come in my sight. Alas, said Sir\nLauncelot; and therewith he took such an heartly sorrow at her words\nthat he fell down to the floor in a swoon. And therewithal Queen\nGuenever departed. And when Sir Launcelot awoke of his swoon, he leapt\nout at a bay window into a garden, and there with thorns he was all\nto-scratched in his visage and his body; and so he ran forth he wist not\nwhither, and was wild wood as ever was man; and so he ran two year, and\nnever man might have grace to know him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. How Dame Elaine was commanded by Queen Guenever to avoid the\ncourt, and how Sir Launcelot became mad.\n\n\nNOW turn we unto Queen Guenever and to the fair Lady Elaine, that when\nDame Elaine heard the queen so to rebuke Sir Launcelot, and also she\nsaw how he swooned, and how he leaped out at a bay window, then she said\nunto Queen Guenever: Madam, ye are greatly to blame for Sir Launcelot,\nfor now have ye lost him, for I saw and heard by his countenance that\nhe is mad for ever. Alas, madam, ye do great sin, and to yourself great\ndishonour, for ye have a lord of your own, and therefore it is your part\nto love him; for there is no queen in this world hath such another king\nas ye have. And, if ye were not, I might have the love of my lord Sir\nLauncelot; and cause I have to love him for he had my maidenhood, and by\nhim I have borne a fair son, and his name is Galahad, and he shall be in\nhis time the best knight of the world. Dame Elaine, said the queen, when\nit is daylight I charge you and command you to avoid my court; and for\nthe love ye owe unto Sir Launcelot discover not his counsel, for an\nye do, it will be his death. As for that, said Dame Elaine, I dare\nundertake he is marred for ever, and that have ye made; for ye, nor I,\nare like to rejoice him; for he made the most piteous groans when he\nleapt out at yonder bay window that ever I heard man make. Alas, said\nfair Elaine, and alas, said the Queen Guenever, for now I wot well we\nhave lost him for ever.\n\nSo on the morn Dame Elaine took her leave to depart, and she would no\nlonger abide. Then King Arthur brought her on her way with mo than an\nhundred knights through a forest. And by the way she told Sir Bors de\nGanis all how it betid that same night, and how Sir Launcelot leapt out\nat a window, araged out of his wit. Alas, said Sir Bors, where is my\nlord, Sir Launcelot, become? Sir, said Elaine, I wot ne'er. Alas, said\nSir Bors, betwixt you both ye have destroyed that good knight. As for\nme, said Dame Elaine, I said never nor did never thing that should in\nany wise displease him, but with the rebuke that Queen Guenever gave him\nI saw him swoon to the earth; and when he awoke he took his sword in his\nhand, naked save his shirt, and leapt out at a window with the grisliest\ngroan that ever I heard man make. Now farewell, Dame Elaine, said Sir\nBors, and hold my lord Arthur with a tale as long as ye can, for I will\nturn again to Queen Guenever and give her a hete; and I require you, as\never ye will have my service, make good watch and espy if ever ye may\nsee my lord Sir Launcelot. Truly, said fair Elaine, I shall do all that\nI may do, for as fain would I know and wit where he is become, as you,\nor any of his kin, or Queen Guenever; and cause great enough have I\nthereto as well as any other. And wit ye well, said fair Elaine to Sir\nBors, I would lose my life for him rather than he should be hurt; but\nalas, I cast me never for to see him, and the chief causer of this\nis Dame Guenever. Madam, said Dame Brisen, the which had made the\nenchantment before betwixt Sir Launcelot and her, I pray you heartily,\nlet Sir Bors depart, and hie him with all his might as fast as he may to\nseek Sir Launcelot, for I warn you he is clean out of his mind; and yet\nhe shall be well holpen an but by miracle.\n\nThen wept Dame Elaine, and so did Sir Bors de Ganis; and so they\ndeparted, and Sir Bors rode straight unto Queen Guenever. And when she\nsaw Sir Bors she wept as she were wood. Fie on your weeping, said Sir\nBors de Ganis, for ye weep never but when there is no bote. Alas, said\nSir Bors, that ever Sir Launcelot's kin saw you, for now have ye lost\nthe best knight of our blood, and he that was all our leader and our\nsuccour; and I dare say and make it good that all kings, christian nor\nheathen, may not find such a knight, for to speak of his nobleness and\ncourtesy, with his beauty and his gentleness. Alas, said Sir Bors, what\nshall we do that be of his blood? Alas, said Sir Ector de Maris. Alas,\nsaid Lionel.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. What sorrow Queen Guenever made for Sir Launcelot, and how he\nwas sought by knights of his kin.\n\n\nAND when the queen heard them say so she fell to the earth in a dead\nswoon. And then Sir Bors took her up, and dawed her; and when she was\nawaked she kneeled afore the three knights, and held up both her hands,\nand besought them to seek him. And spare not for no goods but that he be\nfound, for I wot he is out of his mind. And Sir Bors, Sir Ector, and Sir\nLionel departed from the queen, for they might not abide no longer for\nsorrow. And then the queen sent them treasure enough for their expenses,\nand so they took their horses and their armour, and departed. And then\nthey rode from country to country, in forests, and in wilderness, and\nin wastes; and ever they laid watch both at forests and at all manner of\nmen as they rode, to hearken and spere after him, as he that was a naked\nman, in his shirt, with a sword in his hand. And thus they rode nigh a\nquarter of a year, endlong and overthwart, in many places, forests and\nwilderness, and oft-times were evil lodged for his sake; and yet for all\ntheir labour and seeking could they never hear word of him. And wit you\nwell these three knights were passing sorry.\n\nThen at the last Sir Bors and his fellows met with a knight that hight\nSir Melion de Tartare. Now fair knight, said Sir Bors, whither be ye\naway? for they knew either other afore time. Sir, said Melion, I am\nin the way toward the court of King Arthur. Then we pray you, said Sir\nBors, that ye will tell my lord Arthur, and my lady, Queen Guenever, and\nall the fellowship of the Round Table, that we cannot in no wise hear\ntell where Sir Launcelot is become. Then Sir Melion departed from\nthem, and said that he would tell the king, and the queen, and all the\nfellowship-of the Round Table, as they had desired him. So when Sir\nMelion came to the court of King Arthur he told the king, and the queen,\nand all the fellowship of the Round Table, what Sir Bors had said of Sir\nLauncelot. Then Sir Gawaine, Sir Uwaine, Sir Sagramore le Desirous, Sir\nAglovale, and Sir Percivale de Galis took upon them by the great desire\nof King Arthur, and in especial by the queen, to seek throughout all\nEngland, Wales, and Scotland, to find Sir Launcelot, and with them\nrode eighteen knights mo to bear them fellowship; and wit ye well, they\nlacked no manner of spending; and so were they three and twenty knights.\n\nNow turn we to Sir Launcelot, and speak we of his care and woe, and what\npain he there endured; for cold, hunger, and thirst, he had plenty. And\nthus as these noble knights rode together, they by one assent departed,\nand then they rode by two, by three, and by four, and by five, and\never they assigned where they should meet. And so Sir Aglovale and Sir\nPercivale rode together unto their mother that was a queen in those\ndays. And when she saw her two sons, for joy she wept tenderly. And then\nshe said: Ah, my dear sons, when your father was slain he left me four\nsons, of the which now be twain slain. And for the death of my noble\nson, Sir Lamorak, shall my heart never be glad. And then she kneeled\ndown upon her knees to-fore Aglovale and Sir Percivale, and besought\nthem to abide at home with her. Ah, sweet mother, said Sir Percivale, we\nmay not, for we be come of king's blood of both parties, and therefore,\nmother, it is our kind to haunt arms and noble deeds. Alas, my sweet\nsons, then she said, for your sakes I shall lose my liking and lust,\nand then wind and weather I may not endure, what for the death of your\nfather, King Pellinore, that was shamefully slain by the hands of Sir\nGawaine, and his brother, Sir Gaheris: and they slew him not manly but\nby treason. Ah, my dear sons, this is a piteous complaint for me of\nyour father's death, considering also the death of Sir Lamorak, that\nof knighthood had but few fellows. Now, my dear sons, have this in your\nmind. Then there was but weeping and sobbing in the court when they\nshould depart, and she fell a-swooning in midst of the court.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. How a servant of Sir Aglovale's was slain, and what\nvengeance Sir Aglovale and Sir Percivale did therefore.\n\n\nAND when she was awaked she sent a squire after them with spending\nenough. And so when the squire had overtaken them, they would not suffer\nhim to ride with them, but sent him home again to comfort their mother,\npraying her meekly of her blessing. And so this squire was benighted,\nand by misfortune he happened to come to a castle where dwelled a baron.\nAnd so when the squire was come into the castle, the lord asked him from\nwhence he came, and whom he served. My lord, said the squire, I serve\na good knight that is called Sir Aglovale: the squire said it to good\nintent, weening unto him to have been more forborne for Sir Aglovale's\nsake, than he had said he had served the queen, Aglovale's mother. Well,\nmy fellow, said the lord of that castle, for Sir Aglovale's sake thou\nshalt have evil lodging, for Sir Aglovale slew my brother, and therefore\nthou shalt die on part of payment. And then that lord commanded his men\nto have him away and slay him; and so they did, and so pulled him out of\nthe castle, and there they slew him without mercy.\n\nRight so on the morn came Sir Aglovale and Sir Percivale riding by a\nchurchyard, where men and women were busy, and beheld the dead squire,\nand they thought to bury him. What is there, said Sir Aglovale, that ye\nbehold so fast? A good man stert forth and said: Fair knight, here lieth\na squire slain shamefully this night. How was he slain, fair fellow?\nsaid Sir Aglovale. My fair sir, said the man, the lord of this castle\nlodged this squire this night; and because he said he was servant unto\na good knight that is with King Arthur, his name is Sir Aglovale,\ntherefore the lord commanded to slay him, and for this cause is he\nslain. Gramercy, said Sir Aglovale, and ye shall see his death revenged\nlightly; for I am that same knight for whom this squire was slain.\n\nThen Sir Aglovale called unto him Sir Percivale, and bade him alight\nlightly; and so they alighted both, and betook their horses to their\nmen, and so they yede on foot into the castle. And all so soon as they\nwere within the castle gate Sir Aglovale bade the porter: Go thou unto\nthy lord and tell him that I am Sir Aglovale for whom this squire was\nslain this night. Anon the porter told this to his lord, whose name was\nGoodewin. Anon he armed him, and then he came into the court and said:\nWhich of you is Sir Aglovale? Here I am, said Aglovale: for what\ncause slewest thou this night my mother's squire? I slew him, said Sir\nGoodewin, because of thee, for thou slewest my brother, Sir Gawdelin. As\nfor thy brother, said Sir Aglovale, I avow it I slew him, for he was a\nfalse knight and a betrayer of ladies and of good knights; and for the\ndeath of my squire thou shalt die. I defy thee, said Sir Goodewin.\nThen they lashed together as eagerly as it had been two lions, and Sir\nPercivale he fought with all the remnant that would fight. And within\na while Sir Percivale had slain all that would withstand him; for Sir\nPercivale dealt so his strokes that were so rude that there durst no\nman abide him. And within a while Sir Aglovale had Sir Goodewin at the\nearth, and there he unlaced his helm, and struck off his head. And then\nthey departed and took their horses; and then they let carry the dead\nsquire unto a priory, and there they interred him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. How Sir Pervivale departed secretly from his brother, and\nhow he loosed a knight bound with a chain, and of other doings.\n\n\nAND when this was done they rode into many countries, ever inquiring\nafter Sir Launcelot, but never they could hear of him; and at the last\nthey came to a castle that hight Cardican, and there Sir Percivale\nand Sir Aglovale were lodged together. And privily about midnight Sir\nPercivale came to Aglovale's squire and said: Arise and make thee ready,\nfor ye and I will ride away secretly. Sir, said the squire, I would full\nfain ride with you where ye would have me, but an my lord, your brother,\ntake me he will slay me. As for that care thou not, for I shall be thy\nwarrant.\n\nAnd so Sir Percivale rode till it was after noon, and then he came upon\na bridge of stone, and there he found a knight that was bound with a\nchain fast about the waist unto a pillar of stone. O fair knight, said\nthat bound knight, I require thee loose me of my bonds. What knight are\nye, said Sir Percivale, and for what cause are ye so bound? Sir, I shall\ntell you, said that knight: I am a knight of the Table Round, and my\nname is Sir Persides; and thus by adventure I came this way, and here\nI lodged in this castle at the bridge foot, and therein dwelleth an\nuncourteous lady; and because she proffered me to be her paramour, and I\nrefused her, she set her men upon me suddenly or ever I might come to my\nweapon; and thus they bound me, and here I wot well I shall die but\nif some man of worship break my bands. Be ye of good cheer, said Sir\nPercivale, and because ye are a knight of the Round Table as well as I,\nI trust to God to break your bands. And therewith Sir Percivale pulled\nout his sword and struck at the chain with such a might that he cut\na-two the chain, and through Sir Persides' hauberk and hurt him a\nlittle. O Jesu, said Sir Persides, that was a mighty stroke as ever I\nfelt one, for had not the chain been ye had slain me.\n\nAnd therewithal Sir Persides saw a knight coming out of a castle all\nthat ever he might fling. Beware, sir, said Sir Persides, yonder cometh\na man that will have ado with you. Let him come, said Sir Percivale.\nAnd so he met with that knight in midst of the bridge; and Sir Percivale\ngave him such a buffet that he smote him quite from his horse and over a\npart of the bridge, that, had not been a little vessel under the bridge,\nthat knight had been drowned. And then Sir Percivale took the knight's\nhorse and made Sir Persides to mount up him; and so they rode unto the\ncastle, and bade the lady deliver Sir Persides' servants, or else he\nwould slay all that ever he found; and so for fear she delivered them\nall. Then was Sir Percivale ware of a lady that stood in that tower.\nAh, madam, said Sir Percivale, what use and custom is that in a lady to\ndestroy good knights but if they will be your paramour? Forsooth this is\na shameful custom of a lady, and if I had not a great matter in my hand\nI should fordo your evil customs.\n\nAnd so Sir Persides brought Sir Percivale unto his own castle, and\nthere he made him great cheer all that night. And on the morn, when Sir\nPercivale had heard mass and broken his fast, he bade Sir Persides ride\nunto King Arthur: And tell the king how that ye met with me; and tell my\nbrother, Sir Aglovale, how I rescued you; and bid him seek not after me,\nfor I am in the quest to seek Sir Launcelot du Lake, and though he seek\nme he shall not find me; and tell him I will never see him, nor the\ncourt, till I have found Sir Launcelot. Also tell Sir Kay the Seneschal,\nand to Sir Mordred, that I trust to Jesu to be of as great worthiness\nas either of them, for tell them I shall never forget their mocks and\nscorns that they did to me that day that I was made knight; and tell\nthem I will never see that court till men speak more worship of me than\never men did of any of them both. And so Sir Persides departed from\nSir Percivale, and then he rode unto King Arthur, and told there of\nSir Percivale. And when Sir Aglovale heard him speak of his brother Sir\nPercivale, he said: He departed from me unkindly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. How Sir Percivale met with Sir Ector, and how they fought\nlong, and each had almost slain other.\n\n\nSIR, said Sir Persides, on my life he shall prove a noble knight as any\nnow is living. And when he saw Sir Kay and Sir Mordred, Sir Persides\nsaid thus: My fair lords both, Sir Percivale greeteth you well both, and\nhe sent you word by me that he trusteth to God or ever he come to the\ncourt again to be of as great noblesse as ever were ye both, and mo men\nto speak of his noblesse than ever they did of you. It may well be, said\nSir Kay and Sir Mordred, but at that time when he was made knight he was\nfull unlike to prove a good knight. As for that, said King Arthur, he\nmust needs prove a good knight, for his father and his brethren were\nnoble knights.\n\nAnd now will we turn unto Sir Percivale that rode long; and in a forest\nhe met a knight with a broken shield and a broken helm; and as soon as\neither saw other readily they made them ready to joust, and so hurtled\ntogether with all the might of their horses, and met together so hard,\nthat Sir Percivale was smitten to the earth. And then Sir Percivale\narose lightly, and cast his shield on his shoulder and drew his sword,\nand bade the other knight Alight, and do we battle unto the uttermost.\nWill ye more? said that knight. And therewith he alighted, and put his\nhorse from him; and then they came together an easy pace, and there they\nlashed together with noble swords, and sometime they struck and sometime\nthey foined, and either gave other many great wounds. Thus they fought\nnear half a day, and never rested but right little, and there was none\nof them both that had less wounds than fifteen, and they bled so much\nthat it was marvel they stood on their feet. But this knight that fought\nwith Sir Percivale was a proved knight and a wise-fighting knight, and\nSir Percivale was young and strong, not knowing in fighting as the other\nwas.\n\nThen Sir Percivale spoke first, and said: Sir knight, hold thy hand\na while still, for we have fought for a simple matter and quarrel\noverlong, and therefore I require thee tell me thy name, for I was never\nor this time matched. So God me help, said that knight, and never or\nthis time was there never knight that wounded me so sore as thou hast\ndone, and yet have I fought in many battles; and now shalt thou wit that\nI am a knight of the Table Round, and my name is Sir Ector de Maris,\nbrother unto the good knight, Sir Launcelot du Lake. Alas, said Sir\nPercivale, and my name is Sir Percivale de Galis that hath made my quest\nto seek Sir Launcelot, and now I am siker that I shall never finish\nmy quest, for ye have slain me with your hands. It is not so, said\nSir Ector, for I am slain by your hands, and may not live. Therefore\nI require you, said Sir Ector unto Sir Percivale, ride ye hereby to a\npriory, and bring me a priest that I may receive my Saviour, for I\nmay not live. And when ye come to the court of King Arthur tell not my\nbrother, Sir Launcelot, how that ye slew me, for then he would be your\nmortal enemy, but ye may say that I was slain in my quest as I sought\nhim. Alas, said Sir Percivale, ye say that never will be, for I am so\nfaint for bleeding that I may unnethe stand, how should I then take my\nhorse?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. How by miracle they were both made whole by the coming of\nthe holy vessel of Sangreal.\n\n\nTHEN they made both great dole out of measure. This will not avail, said\nSir Percivale. And then he kneeled down and made his prayer devoutly\nunto Almighty Jesu, for he was one of the best knights of the world that\nat that time was, in whom the very faith stood most in. Right so there\ncame by the holy vessel of the Sangreal with all manner of sweetness and\nsavour; but they could not readily see who that bare that vessel, but\nSir Percivale had a glimmering of the vessel and of the maiden that bare\nit, for he was a perfect clean maiden; and forthwithal they both were as\nwhole of hide and limb as ever they were in their life-days: then they\ngave thankings to God with great mildness. O Jesu, said Sir Percivale,\nwhat may this mean, that we be thus healed, and right now we were at the\npoint of dying? I wot full well, said Sir Ector, what it is; it is an\nholy vessel that is borne by a maiden, and therein is part of the holy\nblood of our Lord Jesu Christ, blessed mote he be. But it may not be\nseen, said Sir Ector, but if it be by a perfect man. So God me help,\nsaid Sir Percivale, I saw a damosel, as me thought, all in white, with a\nvessel in both her hands, and forthwithal I was whole.\n\nSo then they took their horses and their harness, and amended their\nharness as well as they might that was broken; and so they mounted upon\ntheir horses, and rode talking together. And there Sir Ector de Maris\ntold Sir Percivale how he had sought his brother, Sir Launcelot, long,\nand never could hear witting of him: In many strange adventures have I\nbeen in this quest. And so either told other of their adventures.\n\n_Here endeth the eleventh book. And here followeth the twelfth book._\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XII.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. How Sir Launcelot in his madness took a sword and fought with\na knight, and leapt in a bed.\n\n\nAND now leave we of a while of Sir Ector and of Sir Percivale, and speak\nwe of Sir Launcelot that suffered and endured many sharp showers, that\never ran wild wood from place to place, and lived by fruit and such as\nhe might get, and drank water two year; and other clothing had he but\nlittle but his shirt and his breech. Thus as Sir Launcelot wandered here\nand there he came in a fair meadow where he found a pavilion; and there\nby, upon a tree, there hung a white shield, and two swords hung thereby,\nand two spears leaned there by a tree. And when Sir Launcelot saw the\nswords, anon he leapt to the one sword, and took it in his hand, and\ndrew it out. And then he lashed at the shield, that all the meadow rang\nof the dints, that he gave such a noise as ten knights had foughten\ntogether.\n\nThen came forth a dwarf, and leapt unto Sir Launcelot, and would have\nhad the sword out of his hand. And then Sir Launcelot took him by the\nboth shoulders and threw him to the ground upon his neck, that he had\nalmost broken his neck; and therewithal the dwarf cried help. Then\ncame forth a likely knight, and well apparelled in scarlet furred with\nminever. And anon as he saw Sir Launcelot he deemed that he should be\nout of his wit. And then he said with fair speech: Good man, lay down\nthat sword, for as meseemeth thou hadst more need of sleep and of warm\nclothes than to wield that sword. As for that, said Sir Launcelot, come\nnot too nigh, for an thou do, wit thou well I will slay thee.\n\nAnd when the knight of the pavilion saw that, he stert backward within\nthe pavilion. And then the dwarf armed him lightly; and so the knight\nthought by force and might to take the sword from Sir Launcelot, and so\nhe came stepping out; and when Sir Launcelot saw him come so all armed\nwith his sword in his hand, then Sir Launcelot flew to him with such a\nmight, and hit him upon the helm such a buffet, that the stroke troubled\nhis brains, and therewith the sword brake in three. And the knight fell\nto the earth as he had been dead, the blood brasting out of his mouth,\nthe nose, and the ears. And then Sir Launcelot ran into the pavilion,\nand rushed even into the warm bed; and there was a lady in that bed,\nand she gat her smock, and ran out of the pavilion. And when she saw her\nlord lie at the ground like to be dead, then she cried and wept as she\nhad been mad. Then with her noise the knight awaked out of his swoon,\nand looked up weakly with his eyes; and then he asked her, where was\nthat mad man that had given him such a buffet: For such a buffet had I\nnever of man's hand. Sir, said the dwarf, it is not worship to hurt him,\nfor he is a man out of his wit; and doubt ye not he hath been a man of\ngreat worship, and for some heartly sorrow that he hath taken, he is\nfallen mad; and me beseemeth, said the dwarf, he resembleth much unto\nSir Launcelot, for him I saw at the great tournament beside Lonazep.\nJesu defend, said that knight, that ever that noble knight, Sir\nLauncelot, should be in such a plight; but whatsomever he be, said that\nknight, harm will I none do him: and this knight's name was Bliant. Then\nhe said unto the dwarf: Go thou fast on horseback, unto my brother Sir\nSelivant, that is at the Castle Blank, and tell him of mine adventure,\nand bid him bring with him an horse litter, and then will we bear this\nknight unto my castle.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. How Sir Lancelot was carried in an horse litter, and how Sir\nLauncelot rescued Sir Bliant, his host.\n\n\nSO the dwarf rode fast, and he came again and brought Sir Selivant with\nhim, and six men with an horse litter; and so they took up the feather\nbed with Sir Launcelot, and so carried all away with them unto the\nCastle Blank, and he never awaked till he was within the castle. And\nthen they bound his hands and his feet, and gave him good meats and good\ndrinks, and brought him again to his strength and his fairness; but in\nhis wit they could not bring him again, nor to know himself. Thus was\nSir Launcelot there more than a year and a half, honestly arrayed and\nfair faren withal.\n\nThen upon a day this lord of that castle, Sir Bliant, took his arms, on\nhorseback, with a spear, to seek adventures. And as he rode in a forest\nthere met with him two knights adventurous, the one was Breuse Saunce\nPit\u00e9, and his brother, Sir Bertelot; and these two ran both at once upon\nSir Bliant, and brake their spears upon his body. And then they drew out\nswords and made great battle, and fought long together. But at the last\nSir Bliant was sore wounded, and felt himself faint; and then he fled on\nhorseback toward his castle. And as they came hurling under the castle\nwhereas Sir Launcelot lay in a window, [he] saw how two knights laid\nupon Sir Bliant with their swords. And when Sir Launcelot saw that, yet\nas wood as he was he was sorry for his lord, Sir Bliant. And then Sir\nLauncelot brake the chains from his legs and off his arms, and in the\nbreaking he hurt his hands sore; and so Sir Launcelot ran out at a\npostern, and there he met with the two knights that chased Sir Bliant;\nand there he pulled down Sir Bertelot with his bare hands from his\nhorse, and therewithal he wrothe his sword out of his hand; and so he\nleapt unto Sir Breuse, and gave him such a buffet upon the head that he\ntumbled backward over his horse's croup. And when Sir Bertelot saw there\nhis brother have such a fall, he gat a spear in his hand, and would have\nrun Sir Launcelot through: that saw Sir Bliant, and struck off the hand\nof Sir Bertelot. And then Sir Breuse and Sir Bertelot gat their horses\nand fled away.\n\nWhen Sir Selivant came and saw what Sir Launcelot had done for his\nbrother, then he thanked God, and so did his brother, that ever they did\nhim any good. But when Sir Bliant saw that Sir Launcelot was hurt with\nthe breaking of his irons, then was he heavy that ever he bound him.\nBind him no more, said Sir Selivant, for he is happy and gracious. Then\nthey made great joy of Sir Launcelot, and they bound him no more; and\nso he abode there an half year and more. And on the morn early Sir\nLauncelot was ware where came a great boar with many hounds nigh him.\nBut the boar was so big there might no hounds tear him; and the hunters\ncame after, blowing their horns, both upon horseback and some upon foot;\nand then Sir Launcelot was ware where one alighted and tied his horse to\na tree, and leaned his spear against the tree.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. How Sir Launcelot fought against a boar and slew him, and\nhow he was hurt, and brought unto an hermitage.\n\n\nSO came Sir Launcelot and found the horse bounden till a tree, and a\nspear leaning against a tree, and a sword tied to the saddle bow; and\nthen Sir Launcelot leapt into the saddle and gat that spear in his hand,\nand then he rode after the boar; and then Sir Launcelot was ware where\nthe boar set his arse to a tree fast by an hermitage. Then Sir Launcelot\nran at the boar with his spear, and therewith the boar turned him\nnimbly, and rove out the lungs and the heart of the horse, so that\nLauncelot fell to the earth; and, or ever Sir Launcelot might get from\nthe horse, the boar rove him on the brawn of the thigh up to the hough\nbone. And then Sir Launcelot was wroth, and up he gat upon his feet,\nand drew his sword, and he smote off the boar's head at one stroke. And\ntherewithal came out the hermit, and saw him have such a wound. Then the\nhermit came to Sir Launcelot and bemoaned him, and would have had him\nhome unto his hermitage; but when Sir Launcelot heard him speak, he was\nso wroth with his wound that he ran upon the hermit to have slain him,\nand the hermit ran away. And when Sir Launcelot might not overget him,\nhe threw his sword after him, for Sir Launcelot might go no further for\nbleeding; then the hermit turned again, and asked Sir Launcelot how he\nwas hurt. Fellow, said Sir Launcelot, this boar hath bitten me sore.\nThen come with me, said the hermit, and I shall heal you. Go thy way,\nsaid Sir Launcelot, and deal not with me.\n\nThen the hermit ran his way, and there he met with a good knight with\nmany men. Sir, said the hermit, here is fast by my place the goodliest\nman that ever I saw, and he is sore wounded with a boar, and yet he hath\nslain the boar. But well I wot, said the hermit, and he be not holpen,\nthat goodly man shall die of that wound, and that were great pity. Then\nthat knight at the desire of the hermit gat a cart, and in that cart\nthat knight put the boar and Sir Launcelot, for Sir Launcelot was so\nfeeble that they might right easily deal with him; and so Sir Launcelot\nwas brought unto the hermitage, and there the hermit healed him of his\nwound. But the hermit might not find Sir Launcelot's sustenance, and so\nhe impaired and waxed feeble, both of his body and of his wit: for the\ndefault of his sustenance he waxed more wooder than he was aforehand.\n\nAnd then upon a day Sir Launcelot ran his way into the forest; and by\nadventure he came to the city of Corbin, where Dame Elaine was, that\nbare Galahad, Sir Launcelot's son. And so when he was entered into the\ntown he ran through the town to the castle; and then all the young men\nof that city ran after Sir Launcelot, and there they threw turves at\nhim, and gave him many sad strokes. And ever as Sir Launcelot might\noverreach any of them, he threw them so that they would never come in\nhis hands no more; for of some he brake the legs and the arms, and so\nfled into the castle; and then came out knights and squires and rescued\nSir Launcelot. And when they beheld him and looked upon his person, they\nthought they saw never so goodly a man. And when they saw so many wounds\nupon him, all they deemed that he had been a man of worship. And then\nthey ordained him clothes to his body, and straw underneath him, and a\nlittle house. And then every day they would throw him meat, and set him\ndrink, but there was but few would bring him meat to his hands.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. How Sir Launcelot was known by Dame Elaine, and was borne\ninto a chamber and after healed by the Sangreal.\n\n\nSO it befell that King Pelles had a nephew, his name was Castor; and so\nhe desired of the king to be made knight, and so at the request of this\nCastor the king made him knight at the feast of Candlemas. And when Sir\nCastor was made knight, that same day he gave many gowns. And then Sir\nCastor sent for the fool--that was Sir Launcelot. And when he was come\nafore Sir Castor, he gave Sir Launcelot a robe of scarlet and all that\nlonged unto him. And when Sir Launcelot was so arrayed like a knight, he\nwas the seemliest man in all the court, and none so well made. So when\nhe saw his time he went into the garden, and there Sir Launcelot laid\nhim down by a well and slept. And so at-after noon Dame Elaine and her\nmaidens came into the garden to play them; and as they roamed up and\ndown one of Dame Elaine's maidens espied where lay a goodly man by the\nwell sleeping, and anon showed him to Dame Elaine. Peace, said Dame\nElaine, and say no word: and then she brought Dame Elaine where he lay.\nAnd when that she beheld him, anon she fell in remembrance of him, and\nknew him verily for Sir Launcelot; and therewithal she fell a-weeping so\nheartily that she sank even to the earth; and when she had thus wept\na great while, then she arose and called her maidens and said she was\nsick.\n\nAnd so she yede out of the garden, and she went straight to her father,\nand there she took him apart by herself; and then she said: O father,\nnow have I need of your help, and but if that ye help me farewell my\ngood days for ever. What is that, daughter? said King Pelles. Sir, she\nsaid, thus is it: in your garden I went for to sport, and there, by the\nwell, I found Sir Launcelot du Lake sleeping. I may not believe that,\nsaid King Pelles. Sir, she said, truly he is there, and meseemeth he\nshould be distract out of his wit. Then hold you still, said the king,\nand let me deal. Then the king called to him such as he most trusted, a\nfour persons, and Dame Elaine, his daughter. And when they came to the\nwell and beheld Sir Launcelot, anon Dame Brisen knew him. Sir, said Dame\nBrisen, we must be wise how we deal with him, for this knight is out of\nhis mind, and if we awake him rudely what he will do we all know not;\nbut ye shall abide, and I shall throw such an enchantment upon him that\nhe shall not awake within the space of an hour; and so she did.\n\nThen within a little while after, the king commanded that all people\nshould avoid, that none should be in that way thereas the king would\ncome. And so when this was done, these four men and these ladies laid\nhand on Sir Launcelot, and so they bare him into a tower, and so into\na chamber where was the holy vessel of the Sangreal, and by force Sir\nLauncelot was laid by that holy vessel; and there came an holy man\nand unhilled that vessel, and so by miracle and by virtue of that holy\nvessel Sir Launcelot was healed and recovered. And when that he was\nawaked he groaned and sighed, and complained greatly that he was passing\nsore.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. How Sir Launcelot, after that he was whole and had his mind,\nhe was ashamed, and how that Elaine desired a castle for him.\n\n\nAND when Sir Launcelot saw King Pelles and Elaine, he waxed ashamed and\nsaid thus: O Lord Jesu, how came I here? for God's sake, my lord, let\nme wit how I came here. Sir, said Dame Elaine, into this country ye came\nlike a madman, clean out of your wit, and here have ye been kept as a\nfool; and no creature here knew what ye were, until by fortune a maiden\nof mine brought me unto you whereas ye lay sleeping by a well, and anon\nas I verily beheld you I knew you. And then I told my father, and so\nwere ye brought afore this holy vessel, and by the virtue of it thus\nwere ye healed. O Jesu, mercy, said Sir Launcelot; if this be sooth, how\nmany there be that know of my woodness! So God me help, said Elaine, no\nmore but my father, and I, and Dame Brisen. Now for Christ's love, said\nSir Launcelot, keep it in counsel, and let no man know it in the\nworld, for I am sore ashamed that I have been thus miscarried; for I am\nbanished out of the country of Logris for ever, that is for to say the\ncountry of England.\n\nAnd so Sir Launcelot lay more than a fortnight or ever that he might\nstir for soreness. And then upon a day he said unto Dame Elaine these\nwords: Lady Elaine, for your sake I have had much travail, care, and\nanguish, it needeth not to rehearse it, ye know how. Notwithstanding I\nknow well I have done foul to you when that I drew my sword to you, to\nhave slain you, upon the morn when I had lain with you. And all was the\ncause, that ye and Dame Brisen made me for to lie by you maugre mine\nhead; and as ye say, that night Galahad your son was begotten. That is\ntruth, said Dame Elaine. Now will ye for my love, said Sir Launcelot, go\nunto your father and get me a place of him wherein I may dwell? for in\nthe court of King Arthur may I never come. Sir, said Dame Elaine, I will\nlive and die with you, and only for your sake; and if my life might not\navail you and my death might avail you, wit you well I would die for\nyour sake. And I will go to my father and I am sure there is nothing\nthat I can desire of him but I shall have it. And where ye be, my lord\nSir Launcelot, doubt ye not but I will be with you with all the service\nthat I may do. So forthwithal she went to her father and said, Sir, my\nlord, Sir Launcelot, desireth to be here by you in some castle of yours.\nWell daughter, said the king, sith it is his desire to abide in these\nmarches he shall be in the Castle of Bliant, and there shall ye be with\nhim, and twenty of the fairest ladies that be in the country, and they\nshall all be of the great blood, and ye shall have ten knights with you;\nfor, daughter, I will that ye wit we all be honoured by the blood of Sir\nLauncelot.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. How Sir Launcelot came into the joyous Isle, and there he\nnamed himself Le Chevaler Mal Fet.\n\n\nTHEN went Dame Elaine unto Sir Launcelot, and told him all how her\nfather had devised for him and her. Then came the knight Sir Castor,\nthat was nephew unto Kong Pelles, unto Sir Launcelot, and asked him what\nwas his name. Sir, said Sir Launcelot, my name is Le Chevaler Mal Fet,\nthat is to say the knight that hath trespassed. Sir, said Sir Castor, it\nmay well be so, but ever meseemeth your name should be Sir Launcelot du\nLake, for or now I have seen you. Sir, said Launcelot, ye are not as a\ngentle knight: I put case my name were Sir Launcelot, and that it list\nme not to discover my name, what should it grieve you here to keep my\ncounsel, and ye be not hurt thereby? but wit thou well an ever it lie\nin my power I shall grieve you, and that I promise you truly. Then Sir\nCastor kneeled down and besought Sir Launcelot of mercy: For I shall\nnever utter what ye be, while that ye be in these parts. Then Sir\nLauncelot pardoned him.\n\nAnd then, after this, King Pelles with ten knights, and Dame Elaine, and\ntwenty ladies, rode unto the Castle of Bliant that stood in an island\nbeclosed in iron, with a fair water deep and large. And when they were\nthere Sir Launcelot let call it the Joyous Isle; and there was he called\nnone otherwise but Le Chevaler Mal Fet, the knight that hath trespassed.\nThen Sir Launcelot let make him a shield all of sable, and a queen\ncrowned in the midst, all of silver, and a knight clean armed kneeling\nafore her. And every day once, for any mirths that all the ladies might\nmake him, he would once every day look toward the realm of Logris,\nwhere King Arthur and Queen Guenever was. And then would he fall upon a\nweeping as his heart should to-brast.\n\nSo it fell that time Sir Launcelot heard of a jousting fast by his\ncastle, within three leagues. Then he called unto him a dwarf, and he\nbade him go unto that jousting. And or ever the knights depart, look\nthou make there a cry, in hearing of all the knights, that there is one\nknight in the Joyous Isle, that is the Castle of Bliant, and say his\nname is Le Chevaler Mal Fet, that will joust against knights that will\ncome. And who that putteth that knight to the worse shall have a fair\nmaid and a gerfalcon.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. Of a great tourneying in the Joyous Isle, and how Sir\nPervivale and Sir Ector came thither, and Sir Percivale fought with him.\n\n\nSO when this cry was made, unto Joyous Isle drew knights to the number\nof five hundred; and wit ye well there was never seen in Arthur's days\none knight that did so much deeds of arms as Sir Launcelot did three\ndays together; for as the book maketh truly mention, he had the better\nof all the five hundred knights, and there was not one slain of them.\nAnd after that Sir Launcelot made them all a great feast.\n\nAnd in the meanwhile came Sir Percivale de Galis and Sir Ector de Maris\nunder that castle that was called the Joyous Isle. And as they beheld\nthat gay castle they would have gone to that castle, but they might not\nfor the broad water, and bridge could they find none. Then they saw on\nthe other side a lady with a sperhawk on her hand, and Sir Percivale\ncalled unto her, and asked that lady who was in that castle. Fair\nknights, she said, here within this castle is the fairest lady in this\nland, and her name is Elaine. Also we have in this castle the fairest\nknight and the mightiest man that is I dare say living, and he called\nhimself Le Chevaler Mal Fet. How came he into these marches? said Sir\nPercivale. Truly, said the damosel, he came into this country like a mad\nman, with dogs and boys chasing him through the city of Corbin, and by\nthe holy vessel of the Sangreal he was brought into his wit again; but\nhe will not do battle with no knight, but by underne or by noon. And if\nye list to come into the castle, said the lady, ye must ride unto the\nfurther side of the castle and there shall ye find a vessel that will\nbear you and your horse. Then they departed, and came unto the vessel.\nAnd then Sir Percivale alighted, and said to Sir Ector de Maris: Ye\nshall abide me here until that I wit what manner a knight he is; for it\nwere shame unto us, inasmuch as he is but one knight, an we should both\ndo battle with him. Do ye as ye list, said Sir Ector, and here I shall\nabide you until that I hear of you.\n\nThen passed Sir Percivale the water, and when he came to the castle gate\nhe bade the porter: Go thou to the good knight within the castle, and\ntell him here is come an errant knight to joust with him. Sir, said\nthe porter, ride ye within the castle, and there is a common place for\njousting, that lords and ladies may behold you. So anon as Sir Launcelot\nhad warning he was soon ready; and there Sir Percivale and Sir Launcelot\nencountered with such a might, and their spears were so rude, that both\nthe horses and the knights fell to the earth. Then they avoided their\nhorses, and flang out noble swords, and hewed away cantels of their\nshields, and hurtled together with their shields like two boars, and\neither wounded other passing sore. At the last Sir Percivale spake first\nwhen they had foughten there more than two hours. Fair knight, said Sir\nPercivale, I require thee tell me thy name, for I met never with such\na knight. Sir, said Sir Launcelot, my name is Le Chevaler Mal Fet. Now\ntell me your name, said Sir Launcelot, I require you, gentle knight.\nTruly, said Sir Percivale, my name is Sir Percivale de Galis, that was\nbrother unto the good knight, Sir Lamorak de Galis, and King Pellinore\nwas our father, and Sir Aglovale is my brother. Alas, said Sir\nLauncelot, what have I done to fight with you that art a knight of the\nRound Table, that sometime was your fellow?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. How each of them knew other, and of their great courtesy,\nand how his brother Sir Ector came unto him, and of their joy.\n\n\nAND therewithal Sir Launcelot kneeled down upon his knees, and threw\naway his shield and his sword from him. When Sir Percivale saw him do\nso he marvelled what he meant. And then thus he said: Sir knight,\nwhatsomever thou be, I require thee upon the high order of knighthood,\ntell me thy true name. Then he said: So God me help, my name is Sir\nLauncelot du Lake, King Ban's son of Benoy. Alas, said Sir Percivale,\nwhat have I done? I was sent by the queen for to seek you, and so I have\nsought you nigh this two year, and yonder is Sir Ector de Maris, your\nbrother abideth me on the other side of the yonder water. Now for God's\nsake, said Sir Percivale, forgive me mine offences that I have here\ndone. It is soon forgiven, said Sir Launcelot.\n\nThen Sir Percivale sent for Sir Ector de Maris, and when Sir Launcelot\nhad a sight of him, he ran unto him and took him in his arms; and then\nSir Ector kneeled down, and either wept upon other, that all had pity to\nbehold them. Then came Dame Elaine and she there made them great\ncheer as might lie in her power; and there she told Sir Ector and Sir\nPercivale how and in what manner Sir Launcelot came into that country,\nand how he was healed; and there it was known how long Sir Launcelot was\nwith Sir Bliant and with Sir Selivant, and how he first met with them,\nand how he departed from them because of a boar; and how the hermit\nhealed Sir Launcelot of his great wound, and how that he came to Corbin.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. How Sir Bors and Sir Lionel came to King Brandegore, and how\nSir Bors took his son Helin le Blank, and of Sir Launcelot.\n\n\nNOW leave we Sir Launcelot in the Joyous Isle with the Lady Dame Elaine,\nand Sir Percivale and Sir Ector playing with them, and turn we to Sir\nBors de Ganis and Sir Lionel, that had sought Sir Launcelot nigh by the\nspace of two year, and never could they hear of him. And as they thus\nrode, by adventure they came to the house of Brandegore, and there Sir\nBors was well known, for he had gotten a child upon the king's daughter\nfifteen year to-fore, and his name was Helin le Blank. And when Sir Bors\nsaw that child it liked him passing well. And so those knights had good\ncheer of the King Brandegore. And on the morn Sir Bors came afore King\nBrandegore and said: Here is my son Helin le Blank, that as it is said\nhe is my son; and sith it is so, I will that ye wit that I will have him\nwith me unto the court of King Arthur. Sir, said the king, ye may well\ntake him with you, but he is over tender of age. As for that, said\nSir Bors, I will have him with me, and bring him to the house of most\nworship of the world. So when Sir Bors should depart there was made\ngreat sorrow for the departing of Helin le Blank, and great weeping was\nthere made. But Sir Bors and Sir Lionel departed, and within a while\nthey came to Camelot, where was King Arthur. And when King Arthur\nunderstood that Helin le Blank was Sir Bors' son, and nephew unto King\nBrandegore, then King Arthur let him make knight of the Round Table; and\nso he proved a good knight and an adventurous.\n\nNow will we turn to our matter of Sir Launcelot. It befell upon a day\nSir Ector and Sir Percivale came to Sir Launcelot and asked him what\nhe would do, and whether he would go with them unto King Arthur or\nnot. Nay, said Sir Launcelot, that may not be by no mean, for I was so\nentreated at the court that I cast me never to come there more. Sir,\nsaid Sir Ector, I am your brother, and ye are the man in the world that\nI love most; and if I understood that it were your disworship, ye may\nunderstand I would never counsel you thereto; but King Arthur and all\nhis knights, and in especial Queen Guenever, made such dole and sorrow\nthat it was marvel to hear and see. And ye must remember the great\nworship and renown that ye be of, how that ye have been more spoken of\nthan any other knight that is now living; for there is none that beareth\nthe name now but ye and Sir Tristram. Therefore brother, said Sir Ector,\nmake you ready to ride to the court with us, and I dare say there was\nnever knight better welcome to the court than ye; and I wot well and can\nmake it good, said Sir Ector, it hath cost my lady, the queen, twenty\nthousand pound the seeking of you. Well brother, said Sir Launcelot, I\nwill do after your counsel, and ride with you.\n\nSo then they took their horses and made them ready, and took their leave\nat King Pelles and at Dame Elaine. And when Sir Launcelot should depart\nDame Elaine made great sorrow. My lord, Sir Launcelot, said Dame Elaine,\nat this same feast of Pentecost shall your son and mine, Galahad, be\nmade knight, for he is fully now fifteen winter old. Do as ye list, said\nSir Launcelot; God give him grace to prove a good knight. As for that,\nsaid Dame Elaine, I doubt not he shall prove the best man of his kin\nexcept one. Then shall he be a man good enough, said Sir Launcelot.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. How Sir Launcelot with Sir Percivale and Sir Ector came to\nthe court, and of the great joy of him.\n\n\nTHEN they departed, and within five days' journey they came to Camelot,\nthat is called in English, Winchester. And when Sir Launcelot was come\namong them, the king and all the knights made great joy of him. And\nthere Sir Percivale de Galis and Sir Ector de Maris began and told the\nwhole adventures: that Sir Launcelot had been out of his mind the time\nof his absence, and how he called himself Le Chevaler Mal Fet, the\nknight that had trespassed; and in three days Sir Launcelot smote down\nfive hundred knights. And ever as Sir Ector and Sir Percivale told these\ntales of Sir Launcelot, Queen Guenever wept as she should have died.\nThen the queen made great cheer. O Jesu, said King Arthur, I marvel for\nwhat cause ye, Sir Launcelot, went out of your mind. I and many others\ndeem it was for the love of fair Elaine, the daughter of King Pelles, by\nwhom ye are noised that ye have gotten a child, and his name is Galahad,\nand men say he shall do marvels. My lord, said Sir Launcelot, if I did\nany folly I have that I sought. And therewithal the king spake no more.\nBut all Sir Launcelot's kin knew for whom he went out of his mind. And\nthen there were great feasts made and great joy; and many great lords\nand ladies, when they heard that Sir Launcelot was come to the court\nagain, they made great joy.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. How La Beale Isoud counselled Sir Tristram to go unto the\ncourt, to the great feast of Pentecost.\n\n\nNOW will we leave off this matter, and speak we of Sir Tristram, and of\nSir Palomides that was the Saracen unchristened. When Sir Tristram was\ncome home unto Joyous Gard from his adventures, all this while that\nSir Launcelot was thus missed, two year and more, Sir Tristram bare\nthe renown through all the realm of Logris, and many strange adventures\nbefell him, and full well and manly and worshipfully he brought them to\nan end. So when he was come home La Beale Isoud told him of the great\nfeast that should be at Pentecost next following, and there she told him\nhow Sir Launcelot had been missed two year, and all that while he had\nbeen out of his mind, and how he was holpen by the holy vessel, the\nSangreal. Alas, said Sir Tristram, that caused some debate betwixt\nhim and Queen Guenever. Sir, said Dame Isoud, I know it all, for Queen\nGuenever sent me a letter in the which she wrote me all how it was,\nfor to require you to seek him. And now, blessed be God, said La Beale\nIsoud, he is whole and sound and come again to the court.\n\nThereof am I glad, said Sir Tristram, and now shall ye and I make us\nready, for both ye and I will be at the feast. Sir, said Isoud, an it\nplease you I will not be there, for through me ye be marked of many good\nknights, and that caused you to have much more labour for my sake than\nneedeth you. Then will I not be there, said Sir Tristram, but if ye be\nthere. God defend, said La Beale Isoud, for then shall I be spoken of\nshame among all queens and ladies of estate; for ye that are called one\nof the noblest knights of the world, and ye a knight of the Round\nTable, how may ye be missed at that feast? What shall be said among all\nknights? See how Sir Tristram hunteth, and hawketh, and cowereth within\na castle with his lady, and forsaketh your worship. Alas, shall some\nsay, it is pity that ever he was made knight, or that ever he should\nhave the love of a lady. Also what shall queens and ladies say of me?\nIt is pity that I have my life, that I will hold so noble a knight as\nye are from his worship. So God me help, said Sir Tristram unto La Beale\nIsoud, it is passing well said of you and nobly counselled; and now I\nwell understand that ye love me; and like as ye have counselled me I\nwill do a part thereafter. But there shall no man nor child ride with\nme, but myself. And so will I ride on Tuesday next coming, and no more\nharness of war but my spear and my sword.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. How Sir Tristram departed unarmed and met with Sir\nPalomides, and how they smote each other, and how Sir Palomides forbare\nhim.\n\n\nAND so when the day came Sir Tristram took his leave at La Beale Isoud,\nand she sent with him four knights, and within half a mile he sent them\nagain: and within a mile after Sir Tristram saw afore him where Sir\nPalomides had stricken down a knight, and almost wounded him to the\ndeath. Then Sir Tristram repented him that he was not armed, and then\nhe hoved still. With that Sir Palomides knew Sir Tristram, and cried on\nhigh: Sir Tristram, now be we met, for or we depart we will redress our\nold sores. As for that, said Sir Tristram, there was yet never Christian\nman might make his boast that ever I fled from him; and wit ye well, Sir\nPalomides, thou that art a Saracen shall never make thy boast that Sir\nTristram de Liones shall flee from thee. And therewith Sir Tristram\nmade his horse to run, and with all his might he came straight upon\nSir Palomides, and brast his spear upon him an hundred pieces. And\nforthwithal Sir Tristram drew his sword. And then he turned his horse\nand struck at Palomides six great strokes upon his helm; and then Sir\nPalomides stood still, and beheld Sir Tristram, and marvelled of his\nwoodness, and of his folly. And then Sir Palomides said to himself: An\nSir Tristram were armed, it were hard to cease him of this battle, and\nif I turn again and slay him I am ashamed wheresomever that I go.\n\nThen Sir Tristram spake and said: Thou coward knight, what castest thou\nto do; why wilt thou not do battle with me? for have thou no doubt I\nshall endure all thy malice. Ah, Sir Tristram, said Palomides, full\nwell thou wottest I may not fight with thee for shame, for thou art here\nnaked and I am armed, and if I slay thee, dishonour shall be mine.\nAnd well thou wottest, said Sir Palomides to Sir Tristram, I know thy\nstrength and thy hardiness to endure against a good knight. That is\ntruth, said Sir Tristram, I understand thy valiantness well. Ye say\nwell, said Sir Palomides; now, I require you, tell me a question that\nI shall say to you. Tell me what it is, said Sir Tristram, and I shall\nanswer you the truth, as God me help. I put case, said Sir Palomides,\nthat ye were armed at all rights as well as I am, and I naked as ye\nbe, what would you do to me now, by your true knighthood? Ah, said Sir\nTristram, now I understand thee well, Sir Palomides, for now must I say\nmine own judgment, and as God me bless, that I shall say shall not\nbe said for no fear that I have of thee. But this is all: wit Sir\nPalomides, as at this time thou shouldest depart from me, for I would\nnot have ado with thee. No more will I, said Palomides, and therefore\nride forth on thy way. As for that I may choose, said Sir Tristram,\neither to ride or to abide. But Sir Palomides, said Sir Tristram, I\nmarvel of one thing, that thou that art so good a knight, that thou wilt\nnot be christened, and thy brother, Sir Safere, hath been christened\nmany a day.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. How that Sir Tristram gat him harness of a knight which\nwas hurt, and how he overthrew Sir Palomides.\n\n\nAS for that, said Sir Palomides, I may not yet be christened for one\navow that I have made many years agone; howbeit in my heart I believe in\nJesu Christ and his mild mother Mary; but I have but one battle to do,\nand when that is done I will be baptised with a good will. By my head,\nsaid Tristram, as for one battle thou shalt not seek it no longer. For\nGod defend, said Sir Tristram, that through my default thou shouldst\nlonger live thus a Saracen, for yonder is a knight that ye, Sir\nPalomides, have hurt and smitten down. Now help me that I were armed\nin his armour, and I shall soon fulfil thine avows. As ye will, said\nPalomides, so it shall be.\n\nSo they rode both unto that knight that sat upon a bank, and then Sir\nTristram saluted him, and he weakly saluted him again. Sir knight, said\nSir Tristram, I require you tell me your right name. Sir, he said, my\nname is Sir Galleron of Galway, and knight of the Table Round. So God\nme help, said Sir Tristram, I am right heavy of your hurts; but this is\nall, I must pray you to lend me all your whole armour, for ye see I\nam unarmed, and I must do battle with this knight. Sir, said the hurt\nknight, ye shall have it with a good will; but ye must beware, for I\nwarn you that knight is wight. Sir, said Galleron, I pray you tell me\nyour name, and what is that knight's name that hath beaten me. Sir, as\nfor my name it is Sir Tristram de Liones, and as for the knight's name\nthat hath hurt you is Sir Palomides, brother to the good knight Sir\nSafere, and yet is Sir Palomides unchristened. Alas, said Sir Galleron,\nthat is pity that so good a knight and so noble a man of arms should be\nunchristened. So God me help, said Sir Tristram, either he shall slay me\nor I him but that he shall be christened or ever we depart in-sunder.\nMy lord Sir Tristram, said Sir Galleron, your renown and worship is well\nknown through many realms, and God save you this day from shenship and\nshame.\n\nThen Sir Tristram unarmed Galleron, the which was a noble knight, and\nhad done many deeds of arms, and he was a large knight of flesh and\nbone. And when he was unarmed he stood upon his feet, for he was bruised\nin the back with a spear; yet so as Sir Galleron might, he armed Sir\nTristram. And then Sir Tristram mounted upon his own horse, and in his\nhand he gat Sir Galleron's spear; and therewithal Sir Palomides was\nready. And so they came hurtling together, and either smote other in\nmidst of their shields; and therewithal Sir Palomides' spear brake,\nand Sir Tristram smote down the horse; and Sir Palomides, as soon as\nhe might, avoided his horse, and dressed his shield, and pulled out his\nsword. That saw Sir Tristram, and therewithal he alighted and tied his\nhorse till a tree.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. How Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides fought long together,\nand after accorded, and how Sir Tristram made him to be christened.\n\n\nAND then they came together as two wild boars, lashing together, tracing\nand traversing as noble men that oft had been well proved in battle;\nbut ever Sir Palomides dread the might of Sir Tristram, and therefore he\nsuffered him to breathe him. Thus they fought more than two hours, but\noften Sir Tristram smote such strokes at Sir Palomides that he made\nhim to kneel; and Sir Palomides brake and cut away many pieces of Sir\nTristram's shield; and then Sir Palomides wounded Sir Tristram, for\nhe was a well fighting man. Then Sir Tristram was wood wroth out of\nmeasure, and rushed upon Sir Palomides with such a might that Sir\nPalomides fell grovelling to the earth; and therewithal he leapt up\nlightly upon his feet, and then Sir Tristram wounded Palomides sore\nthrough the shoulder. And ever Sir Tristram fought still in like hard,\nand Sir Palomides failed not, but gave him many sad strokes. And at the\nlast Sir Tristram doubled his strokes, and by fortune Sir Tristram smote\nSir Palomides sword out of his hand, and if Sir Palomides had stooped\nfor his sword he had been slain.\n\nThen Palomides stood still and beheld his sword with a sorrowful heart.\nHow now, said Sir Tristram unto Palomides, now have I thee at advantage\nas thou haddest me this day; but it shall never be said in no court,\nnor among good knights, that Sir Tristram shall slay any knight that is\nweaponless; and therefore take thou thy sword, and let us make an end of\nthis battle. As for to do this battle, said Palomides, I dare right well\nend it, but I have no great lust to fight no more. And for this cause,\nsaid Palomides: mine offence to you is not so great but that we may be\nfriends. All that I have offended is and was for the love of La Beale\nIsoud. And as for her, I dare say she is peerless above all other\nladies, and also I proffered her never no dishonour; and by her I have\ngotten the most part of my worship. And sithen I offended never as to\nher own person, and as for the offence that I have done, it was against\nyour own person, and for that offence ye have given me this day many\nsad strokes, and some I have given you again; and now I dare say I\nfelt never man of your might, nor so well breathed, but if it were Sir\nLauncelot du Lake; wherefore I require you, my lord, forgive me all that\nI have offended unto you; and this same day have me to the next church,\nand first let me be clean confessed, and after see you now that I be\ntruly baptised. And then will we all ride together unto the court of\nArthur, that we be there at the high feast. Now take your horse, said\nSir Tristram, and as ye say so it shall be, and all thine evil will God\nforgive it you, and I do. And here within this mile is the Suffragan of\nCarlisle that shall give you the sacrament of baptism.\n\nThen they took their horses and Sir Galleron rode with them. And when\nthey came to the Suffragan Sir Tristram told him their desire. Then the\nSuffragan let fill a great vessel with water, and when he had hallowed\nit he then confessed clean Sir Palomides, and Sir Tristram and Sir\nGalleron were his godfathers. And then soon after they departed, riding\ntoward Camelot, where King Arthur and Queen Guenever was, and for the\nmost part all the knights of the Round Table. And so the king and all\nthe court were glad that Sir Palomides was christened. And at the same\nfeast in came Galahad and sat in the Siege Perilous. And so therewithal\ndeparted and dissevered all the knights of the Round Table. And Sir\nTristram returned again unto Joyous Gard, and Sir Palomides followed the\nQuesting Beast.\n\n\n_Here endeth the second book of Sir Tristram that was drawn out of\nFrench into English. But here is no rehersal of the third book. And\nhere followeth the noble tale of the Sangreal, that called is the Holy\nVessel; and the signification of the blessed blood of our Lord Jesus\nChrist, blessed mote it be, the which was brought into this land by\nJoseph Aramathie. Therefore on all sinful souls blessed Lord have thou\nmercy.\n\nExplicit liber xii. Et incipit Decimustercius._\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XIII.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. How at the vigil of the Feast of Pentecost entered into the\nhall before King Arthur a damosel, and desired Sir Launcelot for to come\nand dub a knight, and how he went with her.\n\n\nAT the vigil of Pentecost, when all the fellowship of the Round Table\nwere come unto Camelot and there heard their service, and the tables\nwere set ready to the meat, right so entered into the hall a full fair\ngentlewoman on horseback, that had ridden full fast, for her horse was\nall besweated. Then she there alighted, and came before the king and\nsaluted him; and he said: Damosel, God thee bless. Sir, said she, for\nGod's sake say me where Sir Launcelot is. Yonder ye may see him, said\nthe king. Then she went unto Launcelot and said: Sir Launcelot, I salute\nyou on King Pelles' behalf, and I require you come on with me hereby\ninto a forest. Then Sir Launcelot asked her with whom she dwelled. I\ndwell, said she, with King Pelles. What will ye with me? said Launcelot.\nYe shall know, said she, when ye come thither. Well, said he, I will\ngladly go with you. So Sir Launcelot bade his squire saddle his horse\nand bring his arms; and in all haste he did his commandment.\n\nThen came the queen unto Launcelot, and said: Will ye leave us at this\nhigh feast? Madam, said the gentlewoman, wit ye well he shall be with\nyou to-morn by dinner time. If I wist, said the queen, that he should\nnot be with us here to-morn he should not go with you by my good will.\nRight so departed Sir Launcelot with the gentlewoman, and rode until\nthat he came into a forest and into a great valley, where they saw an\nabbey of nuns; and there was a squire ready and opened the gates, and\nso they entered and descended off their horses; and there came a fair\nfellowship about Sir Launcelot, and welcomed him, and were passing\nglad of his coming. And then they led him unto the Abbess's chamber\nand unarmed him; and right so he was ware upon a bed lying two of his\ncousins, Sir Bors and Sir Lionel, and then he waked them; and when they\nsaw him they made great joy. Sir, said Sir Bors unto Sir Launcelot, what\nadventure hath brought you hither, for we weened to-morn to have found\nyou at Camelot? As God me help, said Sir Launcelot, a gentlewoman\nbrought me hither, but I know not the cause.\n\nIn the meanwhile that they thus stood talking together, therein came\ntwelve nuns that brought with them Galahad, the which was passing fair\nand well made, that unnethe in the world men might not find his match:\nand all those ladies wept. Sir, said they all, we bring you here this\nchild the which we have nourished, and we pray you to make him a knight,\nfor of a more worthier man's hand may he not receive the order of\nknighthood. Sir Launcelot beheld the young squire and saw him seemly and\ndemure as a dove, with all manner of good features, that he weened\nof his age never to have seen so fair a man of form. Then said Sir\nLauncelot: Cometh this desire of himself? He and all they said yea. Then\nshall he, said Sir Launcelot, receive the high order of knighthood as\nto-morn at the reverence of the high feast. That night Sir Launcelot had\npassing good cheer; and on the morn at the hour of prime, at Galahad's\ndesire, he made him knight and said: God make him a good man, for of\nbeauty faileth you not as any that liveth.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. How the letters were found written in the Siege Perilous and\nof the marvellous adventure of the sword in a stone.\n\n\nNOW fair sir, said Sir Launcelot, will ye come with me unto the court of\nKing Arthur? Nay, said he, I will not go with you as at this time. Then\nhe departed from them and took his two cousins with him, and so they\ncame unto Camelot by the hour of underne on Whitsunday. By that time the\nking and the queen were gone to the minster to hear their service. Then\nthe king and the queen were passing glad of Sir Bors and Sir Lionel,\nand so was all the fellowship. So when the king and all the knights were\ncome from service, the barons espied in the sieges of the Round Table\nall about, written with golden letters: Here ought to sit he, and he\nought to sit here. And thus they went so long till that they came to\nthe Siege Perilous, where they found letters newly written of gold which\nsaid: Four hundred winters and four and fifty accomplished after the\npassion of our Lord Jesu Christ ought this siege to be fulfilled. Then\nall they said: This is a marvellous thing and an adventurous. In the\nname of God, said Sir Launcelot; and then accompted the term of the\nwriting from the birth of our Lord unto that day. It seemeth me said Sir\nLauncelot, this siege ought to be fulfilled this same day, for this is\nthe feast of Pentecost after the four hundred and four and fifty year;\nand if it would please all parties, I would none of these letters were\nseen this day, till he be come that ought to enchieve this adventure.\nThen made they to ordain a cloth of silk, for to cover these letters in\nthe Siege Perilous.\n\nThen the king bade haste unto dinner. Sir, said Sir Kay the Steward, if\nye go now unto your meat ye shall break your old custom of your court,\nfor ye have not used on this day to sit at your meat or that ye have\nseen some adventure. Ye say sooth, said the king, but I had so great joy\nof Sir Launcelot and of his cousins, which be come to the court whole\nand sound, so that I bethought me not of mine old custom. So, as they\nstood speaking, in came a squire and said unto the king: Sir, I bring\nunto you marvellous tidings. What be they? said the king. Sir, there\nis here beneath at the river a great stone which I saw fleet above the\nwater, and therein I saw sticking a sword. The king said: I will see\nthat marvel. So all the knights went with him, and when they came to the\nriver they found there a stone fleeting, as it were of red marble, and\ntherein stuck a fair rich sword, and in the pommel thereof were precious\nstones wrought with subtle letters of gold. Then the barons read the\nletters which said in this wise: Never shall man take me hence, but only\nhe by whose side I ought to hang, and he shall be the best knight of the\nworld.\n\nWhen the king had seen the letters, he said unto Sir Launcelot: Fair\nSir, this sword ought to be yours, for I am sure ye be the best knight\nof the world. Then Sir Launcelot answered full soberly: Certes, sir, it\nis not my sword; also, Sir, wit ye well I have no hardiness to set\nmy hand to it, for it longed not to hang by my side. Also, who that\nassayeth to take the sword and faileth of it, he shall receive a wound\nby that sword that he shall not be whole long after. And I will that\nye wit that this same day shall the adventures of the Sangreal, that is\ncalled the Holy Vessel, begin.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. How Sir Gawaine assayed to draw out the sword, and how an\nold man brought in Galahad.\n\n\nNOW, fair nephew, said the king unto Sir Gawaine, assay ye, for my love.\nSir, he said, save your good grace I shall not do that. Sir, said the\nking, assay to take the sword and at my commandment. Sir, said Gawaine,\nyour commandment I will obey. And therewith he took up the sword by the\nhandles, but he might not stir it. I thank you, said the king to Sir\nGawaine. My lord Sir Gawaine, said Sir Launcelot, now wit ye well this\nsword shall touch you so sore that ye shall will ye had never set your\nhand thereto for the best castle of this realm. Sir, he said, I might\nnot withsay mine uncle's will and commandment. But when the king heard\nthis he repented it much, and said unto Sir Percivale that he should\nassay, for his love. And he said: Gladly, for to bear Sir Gawaine\nfellowship. And therewith he set his hand on the sword and drew it\nstrongly, but he might not move it. Then were there no[1] mo that durst\nbe so hardy to set their hands thereto. Now may ye go to your dinner,\nsaid Sir Kay unto the king, for a marvellous adventure have ye seen.\nSo the king and all went unto the court, and every knight knew his own\nplace, and set him therein, and young men that were knights served them.\n\nSo when they were served, and all sieges fulfilled save only the Siege\nPerilous, anon there befell a marvellous adventure, that all the doors\nand windows of the palace shut by themself. Not for then the hall was\nnot greatly darked; and therewith they were[1] all[1] abashed both one\nand other. Then King Arthur spake first and said: By God, fair fellows\nand lords, we have seen this day marvels, but or night I suppose we\nshall see greater marvels.\n\nIn the meanwhile came in a good old man, and an ancient, clothed all in\nwhite, and there was no knight knew from whence he came. And with him\nhe brought a young knight, both on foot, in red arms, without sword or\nshield, save a scabbard hanging by his side. And these words he said:\nPeace be with you, fair lords. Then the old man said unto Arthur: Sir,\nI bring here a young knight, the which is of king's lineage, and of the\nkindred of Joseph of Aramathie, whereby the marvels of this court, and\nof strange realms, shall be fully accomplished.\n\n\n[1] Omitted by Caxton, supplied from W. de Worde.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. How the old man brought Galahad to the Siege Perilous and\nset him therein, and how all the knights marvelled.\n\n\nTHE king was right glad of his words, and said unto the good man: Sir,\nye be right welcome, and the young knight with you. Then the old man\nmade the young man to unarm him, and he was in a coat of red sendal,\nand bare a mantle upon his shoulder that was furred with ermine, and\nput that upon him. And the old knight said unto the young knight: Sir,\nfollow me. And anon he led him unto the Siege Perilous, where beside\nsat Sir Launcelot; and the good man lift up the cloth, and found there\nletters that said thus: This is the siege of Galahad, the haut prince.\nSir, said the old knight, wit ye well that place is yours. And then he\nset him down surely in that siege. And then he said to the old man: Sir,\nye may now go your way, for well have ye done that ye were commanded to\ndo; and recommend me unto my grandsire, King Pelles, and unto my lord\nPetchere, and say them on my behalf, I shall come and see them as soon\nas ever I may. So the good man departed; and there met him twenty noble\nsquires, and so took their horses and went their way.\n\nThen all the knights of the Table Round marvelled greatly of Sir\nGalahad, that he durst sit there in that Siege Perilous, and was so\ntender of age; and wist not from whence he came but all only by God; and\nsaid: This is he by whom the Sangreal shall be enchieved, for there sat\nnever none but he, but he were mischieved. Then Sir Launcelot beheld his\nson and had great joy of him. Then Bors told his fellows: Upon pain of\nmy life this young knight shall come unto great worship. This noise\nwas great in all the court, so that it came to the queen. Then she had\nmarvel what knight it might be that durst adventure him to sit in the\nSiege Perilous. Many said unto the queen he resembled much unto Sir\nLauncelot. I may well suppose, said the queen, that Sir Launcelot begat\nhim on King Pelles' daughter, by the which he was made to lie by, by\nenchantment, and his name is Galahad. I would fain see him, said the\nqueen, for he must needs be a noble man, for so is his father that him\nbegat, I report me unto all the Table Round.\n\nSo when the meat was done that the king and all were risen, the king\nyede unto the Siege Perilous and lift up the cloth, and found there the\nname of Galahad; and then he shewed it unto Sir Gawaine, and said: Fair\nnephew, now have we among us Sir Galahad, the good knight that shall\nworship us all; and upon pain of my life he shall enchieve the Sangreal,\nright as Sir Launcelot had done us to understand. Then came King Arthur\nunto Galahad and said: Sir, ye be welcome, for ye shall move many good\nknights to the quest of the Sangreal, and ye shall enchieve that never\nknights might bring to an end. Then the king took him by the hand, and\nwent down from the palace to shew Galahad the adventures of the stone.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. How King Arthur shewed the stone hoving on the water to\nGalahad, and how he drew out the sword.\n\n\nTHE queen heard thereof, and came after with many ladies, and shewed\nthem the stone where it hoved on the water. Sir, said the king unto Sir\nGalahad, here is a great marvel as ever I saw, and right good knights\nhave assayed and failed. Sir, said Galahad, that is no marvel, for this\nadventure is not theirs but mine; and for the surety of this sword I\nbrought none with me, for here by my side hangeth the scabbard. And anon\nhe laid his hand on the sword, and lightly drew it out of the stone, and\nput it in the sheath, and said unto the king: Now it goeth better than\nit did aforehand. Sir, said the king, a shield God shall send you. Now\nhave I that sword that sometime was the good knight's, Balin le Savage,\nand he was a passing good man of his hands; and with this sword he slew\nhis brother Balan, and that was great pity, for he was a good knight,\nand either slew other through a dolorous stroke that Balin gave unto my\ngrandfather King Pelles, the which is not yet whole, nor not shall be\ntill I heal him.\n\nTherewith the king and all espied where came riding down the river a\nlady on a white palfrey toward them. Then she saluted the king and the\nqueen, and asked if that Sir Launcelot was there. And then he answered\nhimself: I am here, fair lady. Then she said all with weeping: How your\ngreat doing is changed sith this day in the morn. Damosel, why say you\nso? said Launcelot. I say you sooth, said the damosel, for ye were this\nday the best knight of the world, but who should say so now, he should\nbe a liar, for there is now one better than ye, and well it is proved by\nthe adventures of the sword whereto ye durst not set to your hand; and\nthat is the change and leaving of your name. Wherefore I make unto you a\nremembrance, that ye shall not ween from henceforth that ye be the best\nknight of the world. As touching unto that, said Launcelot, I know well\nI was never the best. Yes, said the damosel, that were ye, and are\nyet, of any sinful man of the world. And, Sir king, Nacien, the hermit,\nsendeth thee word, that thee shall befall the greatest worship that\never befell king in Britain; and I say you wherefore, for this day the\nSangreal appeared in thy house and fed thee and all thy fellowship of\nthe Round Table. So she departed and went that same way that she came.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. How King Arthur had all the knights together for to joust in\nthe meadow beside Camelot or they departed.\n\n\nNow, said the king, I am sure at this quest of the Sangreal shall all\nye of the Table Round depart, and never shall I see you again whole\ntogether; therefore I will see you all whole together in the meadow of\nCamelot to joust and to tourney, that after your death men may speak of\nit that such good knights were wholly together such a day. As unto that\ncounsel and at the king's request they accorded all, and took on their\nharness that longed unto jousting. But all this moving of the king\nwas for this intent, for to see Galahad proved; for the king deemed he\nshould not lightly come again unto the court after his departing. So\nwere they assembled in the meadow, both more and less. Then Sir\nGalahad, by the prayer of the king and the queen, did upon him a noble\njesseraunce, and also he did on his helm, but shield would he take none\nfor no prayer of the king. And then Sir Gawaine and other knights prayed\nhim to take a spear. Right so he did; and the queen was in a tower with\nall her ladies, for to behold that tournament. Then Sir Galahad dressed\nhim in midst of the meadow, and began to break spears marvellously, that\nall men had wonder of him; for he there surmounted all other knights,\nfor within a while he had defouled many good knights of the Table Round\nsave twain, that was Sir Launcelot and Sir Percivale.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. How the queen desired to see Galahad; and how after, all\nthe knights were replenished with the Holy Sangreal, and how they avowed\nthe enquest of the same.\n\n\nTHEN the king, at the queen's request, made him to alight and to unlace\nhis helm, that the queen might see him in the visage. When she beheld\nhim she said: Soothly I dare well say that Sir Launcelot begat him, for\nnever two men resembled more in likeness, therefore it nis no marvel\nthough he be of great prowess. So a lady that stood by the queen said:\nMadam, for God's sake ought he of right to be so good a knight? Yea,\nforsooth, said the queen, for he is of all parties come of the best\nknights of the world and of the highest lineage; for Sir Launcelot is\ncome but of the eighth degree from our Lord Jesu Christ, and Sir Galahad\nis of the ninth degree from our Lord Jesu Christ, therefore I dare say\nthey be the greatest gentlemen of the world.\n\nAnd then the king and all estates went home unto Camelot, and so went\nto evensong to the great minster, and so after upon that to supper, and\nevery knight sat in his own place as they were toforehand. Then anon\nthey heard cracking and crying of thunder, that them thought the place\nshould all to-drive. In the midst of this blast entered a sunbeam\nmore clearer by seven times than ever they saw day, and all they were\nalighted of the grace of the Holy Ghost. Then began every knight to\nbehold other, and either saw other, by their seeming, fairer than ever\nthey saw afore. Not for then there was no knight might speak one word\na great while, and so they looked every man on other as they had been\ndumb. Then there entered into the hall the Holy Grail covered with white\nsamite, but there was none might see it, nor who bare it. And there was\nall the hall fulfilled with good odours, and every knight had such meats\nand drinks as he best loved in this world. And when the Holy Grail had\nbeen borne through the hall, then the holy vessel departed suddenly,\nthat they wist not where it became: then had they all breath to speak.\nAnd then the king yielded thankings to God, of His good grace that he\nhad sent them. Certes, said the king, we ought to thank our Lord Jesu\ngreatly for that he hath shewed us this day, at the reverence of this\nhigh feast of Pentecost.\n\nNow, said Sir Gawaine, we have been served this day of what meats and\ndrinks we thought on; but one thing beguiled us, we might not see the\nHoly Grail, it was so preciously covered. Wherefore I will make here\navow, that to-morn, without longer abiding, I shall labour in the quest\nof the Sangreal, that I shall hold me out a twelvemonth and a day, or\nmore if need be, and never shall I return again unto the court till I\nhave seen it more openly than it hath been seen here; and if I may not\nspeed I shall return again as he that may not be against the will of our\nLord Jesu Christ.\n\nWhen they of the Table Round heard Sir Gawaine say so, they arose up\nthe most part and made such avows as Sir Gawaine had made. Anon as King\nArthur heard this he was greatly displeased, for he wist well they might\nnot again-say their avows. Alas, said King Arthur unto Sir Gawaine,\nye have nigh slain me with the avow and promise that ye have made; for\nthrough you ye have bereft me the fairest fellowship and the truest of\nknighthood that ever were seen together in any realm of the world; for\nwhen they depart from hence I am sure they all shall never meet more in\nthis world, for they shall die many in the quest. And so it forthinketh\nme a little, for I have loved them as well as my life, wherefore it\nshall grieve me right sore, the departition of this fellowship: for I\nhave had an old custom to have them in my fellowship.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. How great sorrow was made of the king and the queen and\nladies for the departing of the knights, and how they departed.\n\n\nAND therewith the tears fell in his eyes. And then he said: Gawaine,\nGawaine, ye have set me in great sorrow, for I have great doubt that\nmy true fellowship shall never meet here more again. Ah, said Sir\nLauncelot, comfort yourself; for it shall be unto us a great honour and\nmuch more than if we died in any other places, for of death we be siker.\nAh, Launcelot, said the king, the great love that I have had unto you\nall the days of my life maketh me to say such doleful words; for never\nChristian king had never so many worthy men at his table as I have had\nthis day at the Round Table, and that is my great sorrow.\n\nWhen the queen, ladies, and gentlewomen, wist these tidings, they had\nsuch sorrow and heaviness that there might no tongue tell it, for those\nknights had held them in honour and chiert\u00e9. But among all other Queen\nGuenever made great sorrow. I marvel, said she, my lord would suffer\nthem to depart from him. Thus was all the court troubled for the love\nof the departition of those knights. And many of those ladies that loved\nknights would have gone with their lovers; and so had they done, had not\nan old knight come among them in religious clothing; and then he spake\nall on high and said: Fair lords, which have sworn in the quest of the\nSangreal, thus sendeth you Nacien, the hermit, word, that none in this\nquest lead lady nor gentlewoman with him, for it is not to do in so high\na service as they labour in; for I warn you plain, he that is not clean\nof his sins he shall not see the mysteries of our Lord Jesu Christ. And\nfor this cause they left these ladies and gentlewomen.\n\nAfter this the queen came unto Galahad and asked him of whence he\nwas, and of what country. He told her of whence he was. And son unto\nLauncelot, she said he was. As to that, he said neither yea nor nay. So\nGod me help, said the queen, of your father ye need not to shame you,\nfor he is the goodliest knight, and of the best men of the world come,\nand of the strain, of all parties, of kings. Wherefore ye ought of right\nto be, of your deeds, a passing good man; and certainly, she said,\nye resemble him much. Then Sir Galahad was a little ashamed and said:\nMadam, sith ye know in certain, wherefore do ye ask it me? for he that\nis my father shall be known openly and all betimes. And then they went\nto rest them. And in the honour of the highness of Galahad he was led\ninto King Arthur's chamber, and there rested in his own bed.\n\nAnd as soon as it was day the king arose, for he had no rest of all that\nnight for sorrow. Then he went unto Gawaine and to Sir Launcelot that\nwere arisen for to hear mass. And then the king again said: Ah Gawaine,\nGawaine, ye have betrayed me; for never shall my court be amended by\nyou, but ye will never be sorry for me as I am for you. And therewith\nthe tears began to run down by his visage. And therewith the king said:\nAh, knight Sir Launcelot, I require thee thou counsel me, for I would\nthat this quest were undone, an it might be Sir, said Sir Launcelot, ye\nsaw yesterday so many worthy knights that then were sworn that they may\nnot leave it in no manner of wise. That wot I well, said the king, but\nit shall so heavy me at their departing that I wot well there shall no\nmanner of joy remedy me. And then the king and the queen went unto the\nminster. So anon Launcelot and Gawaine commanded their men to bring\ntheir arms. And when they all were armed save their shields and their\nhelms, then they came to their fellowship, which were all ready in the\nsame wise, for to go to the minster to hear their service.\n\nThen after the service was done the king would wit how many had\nundertaken the quest of the Holy Grail; and to accompt them he prayed\nthem all. Then found they by the tale an hundred and fifty, and all\nwere knights of the Round Table. And then they put on their helms and\ndeparted, and recommended them all wholly unto the queen; and there was\nweeping and great sorrow. Then the queen departed into her chamber and\nheld her, so that no man should perceive her great sorrows. When Sir\nLauncelot missed the queen he went till her chamber, and when she saw\nhim she cried aloud: O Launcelot, Launcelot, ye have betrayed me and put\nme to the death, for to leave thus my lord. Ah, madam, I pray you be\nnot displeased, for I shall come again as soon as I may with my worship.\nAlas, said she, that ever I saw you; but he that suffered upon the cross\nfor all mankind, he be unto you good conduct and safety, and all the\nwhole fellowship.\n\nRight so departed Sir Launcelot, and found his fellowship that abode\nhis coming. And so they mounted upon their horses and rode through the\nstreets of Camelot; and there was weeping of rich and poor, and the king\nturned away and might not speak for weeping. So within a while they came\nto a city, and a castle that hight Vagon. There they entered into the\ncastle, and the lord of that castle was an old man that hight Vagon, and\nhe was a good man of his living, and set open the gates, and made them\nall the cheer that he might. And so on the morn they were all accorded\nthat they should depart everych from other; and on the morn they\ndeparted with weeping cheer, and every knight took the way that him\nliked best.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. How Galahad gat him a shield, and how they sped that\npresumed to take down the said shield.\n\n\nNOW rideth Sir Galahad yet without shield, and so he rode four days\nwithout any adventure. And at the fourth day after evensong he came to\na White Abbey, and there he was received with great reverence, and led\nunto a chamber, and there was he unarmed; and then was he ware of two[1]\nknights of the Table Round, one was Sir Bagdemagus, and[1] that[1]\nother[1] was Sir Uwaine. And when they saw him they went unto Galahad\nand made of him great solace, and so they went unto supper. Sirs, said\nSir Galahad, what adventure brought you hither? Sir, said they, it is\ntold us that within this place is a shield that no man may bear about\nhis neck but he be mischieved outher dead within three days, or maimed\nfor ever. Ah sir, said King Bagdemagus, I shall it bear to-morrow for\nto assay this adventure. In the name of God, said Sir Galahad. Sir, said\nBagdemagus, an I may not enchieve the adventure of this shield ye shall\ntake it upon you, for I am sure ye shall not fail. Sir, said Galahad, I\nright well agree me thereto, for I have no shield. So on the morn they\narose and heard mass. Then Bagdemagus asked where the adventurous shield\nwas. Anon a monk led him behind an altar where the shield hung as white\nas any snow, but in the midst was a red cross. Sir, said the monk,\nthis shield ought not to be hanged about no knight's neck but he be the\nworthiest knight of the world;\n\n[1] Omitted by Caxton, supplied from W. de Worde.\n\ntherefore I counsel you knights to be well advised. Well, said\nBagdemagus, I wot well that I am not the best knight of the world, but\nyet I shall assay to bear it, and so bare it out of the minster. And\nthen he said unto Galahad: An it please you abide here still, till\nye wit how that I speed. I shall abide you, said Galahad. Then King\nBagdemagus took with him a good squire, to bring tidings unto Sir\nGalahad how he sped.\n\nThen when they had ridden a two mile and came to a fair valley afore an\nhermitage, then they saw a knight come from that part in white armour,\nhorse and all; and he came as fast as his horse might run, and his spear\nin his rest, and Bagdemagus dressed his spear against him and brake it\nupon the white knight. But the other struck him so hard that he brast\nthe mails, and sheef him through the right shoulder, for the shield\ncovered him not as at that time; and so he bare him from his horse.\nAnd therewith he alighted and took the white shield from him, saying:\nKnight, thou hast done thyself great folly, for this shield ought not\nto be borne but by him that shall have no peer that liveth. And then\nhe came to Bagdemagus' squire and said: Bear this shield unto the good\nknight Sir Galahad, that thou left in the abbey, and greet him well by\nme. Sir, said the squire, what is your name? Take thou no heed of my\nname, said the knight, for it is not for thee to know nor for none\nearthly man. Now, fair sir, said the squire, at the reverence of Jesu\nChrist, tell me for what cause this shield may not be borne but if the\nbearer thereof be mischieved. Now sith thou hast conjured me so, said\nthe knight, this shield behoveth unto no man but unto Galahad. And the\nsquire went unto Bagdemagus and asked whether he were sore wounded or\nnot. Yea forsooth, said he, I shall escape hard from the death. Then he\nfetched his horse, and brought him with great pain unto an abbey. Then\nwas he taken down softly and unarmed, and laid in a bed, and there was\nlooked to his wounds. And as the book telleth, he lay there long, and\nescaped hard with the life.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. How Galahad departed with the shield, and how King Evelake\nhad received the shield of Joseph of Aramathie.\n\n\nSIR GALAHAD, said the squire, that knight that wounded Bagdemagus\nsendeth you greeting, and bade that ye should bear this shield,\nwherethrough great adventures should befall. Now blessed be God and\nfortune, said Galahad. And then he asked his arms, and mounted upon his\nhorse, and hung the white shield about his neck, and commended them unto\nGod. And Sir Uwaine said he would bear him fellowship if it pleased\nhim. Sir, said Galahad, that may ye not, for I must go alone, save this\nsquire shall bear me fellowship: and so departed Uwaine.\n\nThen within a while came Galahad thereas the White Knight abode him by\nthe hermitage, and everych saluted other courteously. Sir, said Galahad,\nby this shield be many marvels fallen. Sir, said the knight, it befell\nafter the passion of our Lord Jesu Christ thirty-two year, that Joseph\nof Aramathie, the gentle knight, the which took down our Lord off the\nholy Cross, at that time he departed from Jerusalem with a great party\nof his kindred with him. And so he laboured till that they came to a\ncity that hight Sarras. And at that same hour that Joseph came to Sarras\nthere was a king that hight Evelake, that had great war against the\nSaracens, and in especial against one Saracen, the which was King\nEvelake's cousin, a rich king and a mighty, which marched nigh this\nland, and his name was called Tolleme la Feintes. So on a day these two\nmet to do battle. Then Joseph, the son of Joseph of Aramathie, went to\nKing Evelake and told him he should be discomfit and slain, but if he\nleft his belief of the old law and believed upon the new law. And then\nthere he shewed him the right belief of the Holy Trinity, to the which\nhe agreed unto with all his heart; and there this shield was made for\nKing Evelake, in the name of Him that died upon the Cross. And then\nthrough his good belief he had the better of King Tolleme. For when\nEvelake was in the battle there was a cloth set afore the shield, and\nwhen he was in the greatest peril he let put away the cloth, and then\nhis enemies saw a figure of a man on the Cross, wherethrough they\nall were discomfit. And so it befell that a man of King Evelake's was\nsmitten his hand off, and bare that hand in his other hand; and Joseph\ncalled that man unto him and bade him go with good devotion touch the\nCross. And as soon as that man had touched the Cross with his hand it\nwas as whole as ever it was to-fore. Then soon after there fell a great\nmarvel, that the cross of the shield at one time vanished away that no\nman wist where it became. And then King Evelake was baptised, and for\nthe most part all the people of that city. So, soon after Joseph would\ndepart, and King Evelake would go with him, whether he wold or nold.\nAnd so by fortune they came into this land, that at that time was called\nGreat Britain; and there they found a great felon paynim, that put\nJoseph into prison. And so by fortune tidings came unto a worthy man\nthat hight Mondrames, and he assembled all his people for the great\nrenown he had heard of Joseph; and so he came into the land of Great\nBritain and disherited this felon paynim and consumed him, and therewith\ndelivered Joseph out of prison. And after that all the people were\nturned to the Christian faith.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. How Joseph made a cross on the white shield with his blood,\nand how Galahad was by a monk brought to a tomb.\n\n\nNOT long after that Joseph was laid in his deadly bed. And when King\nEvelake saw that he made much sorrow, and said: For thy love I have left\nmy country, and sith ye shall depart out of this world, leave me some\ntoken of yours that I may think on you. Joseph said: That will I do\nfull gladly; now bring me your shield that I took you when ye went into\nbattle against King Tolleme. Then Joseph bled sore at the nose, so that\nhe might not by no mean be staunched. And there upon that shield he made\na cross of his own blood. Now may ye see a remembrance that I love you,\nfor ye shall never see this shield but ye shall think on me, and it\nshall be always as fresh as it is now. And never shall man bear this\nshield about his neck but he shall repent it, unto the time that\nGalahad, the good knight, bear it; and the last of my lineage shall have\nit about his neck, that shall do many marvellous deeds. Now, said King\nEvelake, where shall I put this shield, that this worthy knight may have\nit? Ye shall leave it thereas Nacien, the hermit, shall be put after his\ndeath; for thither shall that good knight come the fifteenth day after\nthat he shall receive the order of knighthood: and so that day that they\nset is this time that he have his shield, and in the same abbey lieth\nNacien, the hermit. And then the White Knight vanished away.\n\nAnon as the squire had heard these words, he alighted off his hackney\nand kneeled down at Galahad's feet, and prayed him that he might go with\nhim till he had made him knight. Yea,[1] I would not refuse you. Then\nwill ye make me a knight? said the squire, and that order, by the grace\nof God, shall be well set in me. So Sir Galahad granted him, and turned\nagain unto the abbey where they came from; and there men made great joy\nof Sir Galahad. And anon as he was alighted there was a monk brought him\nunto a tomb in a churchyard, where there was such a noise that who that\nheard it should verily nigh be mad or lose his strength: and sir, they\nsaid, we deem it is a fiend.\n\n\n[1] Caxton \"Yf,\" for which \"Ye\" seems the easiest emendation that\nwill save the sense.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. Of the marvel that Sir Galahad saw and heard in the tomb,\nand how he made Melias knight.\n\n\nNOW lead me thither, said Galahad. And so they did, all armed save his\nhelm. Now, said the good man, go to the tomb and lift it up. So he did,\nand heard a great noise; and piteously he said, that all men might hear\nit: Sir Galahad, the servant of Jesu Christ, come thou not nigh me, for\nthou shalt make me go again there where I have been so long. But Galahad\nwas nothing afraid, but lifted up the stone; and there came out so foul\na smoke, and after he saw the foulest figure leap thereout that ever he\nsaw in the likeness of a man; and then he blessed him and wist well\nit was a fiend. Then heard he a voice say Galahad, I see there environ\nabout thee so many angels that my power may not dere thee{sic} Right\nso Sir Galahad saw a body all armed lie in that tomb, and beside him a\nsword. Now, fair brother, said Galahad, let us remove this body, for it\nis not worthy to lie in this churchyard, for he was a false Christian\nman. And therewith they all departed and went to the abbey. And anon as\nhe was unarmed a good man came and set him down by him and said: Sir,\nI shall tell you what betokeneth all that ye saw in the tomb; for that\ncovered body betokeneth the duresse of the world, and the great sin that\nOur Lord found in the world. For there was such wretchedness that the\nfather loved not the son, nor the son loved not the father; and that was\none of the causes that Our Lord took flesh and blood of a clean\nmaiden, for our sins were so great at that time that well-nigh all was\nwickedness. Truly, said Galahad, I believe you right well.\n\nSo Sir Galahad rested him there that night; and upon the morn he made\nthe squire knight, and asked him his name, and of what kindred he was\ncome. Sir, said he, men calleth me Melias de Lile, and I am the son of\nthe King of Denmark. Now, fair sir, said Galahad, sith that ye be come\nof kings and queens, now look that knighthood be well set in you, for\nye ought to be a mirror unto all chivalry. Sir, said Sir Melias, ye say\nsooth. But, sir, sithen ye have made me a knight ye must of right grant\nme my first desire that is reasonable. Ye say sooth, said Galahad.\nMelias said: Then that ye will suffer me to ride with you in this quest\nof the Sangreal, till that some adventure depart us. I grant you, sir.\n\nThen men brought Sir Melias his armour and his spear and his horse,\nand so Sir Galahad and he rode forth all that week or they found any\nadventure. And then upon a Monday in the morning, as they were departed\nfrom an abbey, they came to a cross which departed two ways, and in that\ncross were letters written that said thus: Now, ye knights errant, the\nwhich goeth to seek knights adventurous, see here two ways; that one way\ndefendeth thee that thou ne go that way, for he shall not go out of the\nway again but if he be a good man and a worthy knight; and if thou go on\nthe left hand, thou shalt not lightly there win prowess, for thou shalt\nin this way be soon assayed. Sir, said Melias to Galahad, if it like\nyou to suffer me to take the way on the left hand, tell me, for there I\nshall well prove my strength. It were better, said Galahad, ye rode not\nthat way, for I deem I should better escape in that way than ye. Nay, my\nlord, I pray you let me have that adventure. Take it in God's name, said\nGalahad.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. Of the adventure that Melias had, and how Galahad revenged\nhim, and how Melias was carried into an abbey.\n\n\nAND then rode Melias into an old forest, and therein he rode two days\nand more. And then he came into a fair meadow, and there was a fair\nlodge of boughs. And then he espied in that lodge a chair, wherein was\na crown of gold, subtly wrought. Also there were cloths covered upon\nthe earth, and many delicious meats set thereon. Sir Melias beheld this\nadventure, and thought it marvellous, but he had no hunger, but of the\ncrown of gold he took much keep; and therewith he stooped down and took\nit up, and rode his way with it. And anon he saw a knight came riding\nafter him that said: Knight, set down that crown which is not yours, and\ntherefore defend you. Then Sir Melias blessed him and said: Fair lord\nof heaven, help and save thy new-made knight. And then they let their\nhorses run as fast as they might, so that the other knight smote Sir\nMelias through hauberk and through the left side, that he fell to the\nearth nigh dead. And then he took the crown and went his way; and Sir\nMelias lay still and had no power to stir.\n\nIn the meanwhile by fortune there came Sir Galahad and found him there\nin peril of death. And then he said: Ah Melias, who hath wounded you?\ntherefore it had been better to have ridden the other way. And when Sir\nMelias heard him speak: Sir, he said, for God's love let me not die\nin this forest, but bear me unto the abbey here beside, that I may be\nconfessed and have my rights. It shall be done, said Galahad, but where\nis he that hath wounded you? With that Sir Galahad heard in the leaves\ncry on high: Knight, keep thee from me. Ah sir, said Melias, beware, for\nthat is he that hath slain me. Sir Galahad answered: Sir knight, come on\nyour peril. Then either dressed to other, and came together as fast as\ntheir horses might run, and Galahad smote him so that his spear went\nthrough his shoulder, and smote him down off his horse, and in the\nfalling Galahad's spear brake.\n\nWith that came out another knight out of the leaves, and brake a spear\nupon Galahad or ever he might turn him. Then Galahad drew out his sword\nand smote off the left arm of him, so that it fell to the earth. And\nthen he fled, and Sir Galahad pursued fast after him. And then he turned\nagain unto Sir Melias, and there he alighted and dressed him softly on\nhis horse to-fore him, for the truncheon of his spear was in his body;\nand Sir Galahad stert up behind him, and held him in his arms, and so\nbrought him to the abbey, and there unarmed him and brought him to his\nchamber. And then he asked his Saviour. And when he had received Him\nhe said unto Sir Galahad: Sir, let death come when it pleaseth him. And\ntherewith he drew out the truncheon of the spear out of his body: and\nthen he swooned.\n\nThen came there an old monk which sometime had been a knight, and\nbeheld Sir Melias. And anon he ransacked him; and then he said unto Sir\nGalahad: I shall heal him of his wound, by the grace of God, within the\nterm of seven weeks. Then was Sir Galahad glad, and unarmed him, and\nsaid he would abide there three days. And then he asked Sir Melias\nhow it stood with him. Then he said he was turned unto helping, God be\nthanked.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. How Sir Galahad departed, and how he was commanded to go to\nthe Castle of Maidens to destroy the wicked custom.\n\n\nNOW will I depart, said Galahad, for I have much on hand, for many good\nknights be full busy about it, and this knight and I were in the same\nquest of the Sangreal. Sir, said a good man, for his sin he was thus\nwounded; and I marvel, said the good man, how ye durst take upon you so\nrich a thing as the high order of knighthood without clean confession,\nand that was the cause ye were bitterly wounded. For the way on the\nright hand betokeneth the highway of our Lord Jesu Christ, and the\nway of a good true good liver. And the other way betokeneth the way\nof sinners and of misbelievers. And when the devil saw your pride and\npresumption, for to take you in the quest of the Sangreal, that made you\nto be overthrown, for it may not be enchieved but by virtuous living.\nAlso, the writing on the cross was a signification of heavenly deeds,\nand of knightly deeds in God's works, and no knightly deeds in worldly\nworks. And pride is head of all deadly sins, that caused this knight\nto depart from Galahad. And where thou tookest the crown of gold thou\nsinnest in covetise and in theft: all this were no knightly deeds. And\nthis Galahad, the holy knight, the which fought with the two knights,\nthe two knights signify the two deadly sins which were wholly in this\nknight Melias; and they might not withstand you, for ye are without\ndeadly sin.\n\nNow departed Galahad from thence, and betaught them all unto God. Sir\nMelias said: My lord Galahad, as soon as I may ride I shall seek you.\nGod send you health, said Galahad, and so took his horse and departed,\nand rode many journeys forward and backward, as adventure would lead\nhim. And at the last it happened him to depart from a place or a castle\nthe which was named Abblasoure; and he had heard no mass, the which he\nwas wont ever to hear or ever he departed out of any castle or place,\nand kept that for a custom. Then Sir Galahad came unto a mountain\nwhere he found an old chapel, and found there nobody, for all, all was\ndesolate; and there he kneeled to-fore the altar, and besought God of\nwholesome counsel. So as he prayed he heard a voice that said: Go thou\nnow, thou adventurous knight, to the Castle of Maidens, and there do\nthou away the wicked customs.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. How Sir Galahad fought with the knights of the castle, and\ndestroyed the wicked custom.\n\n\nWHEN Sir Galahad heard this he thanked God, and took his horse; and he\nhad not ridden but half a mile, he saw in the valley afore him a strong\ncastle with deep ditches, and there ran beside it a fair river that\nhight Severn; and there he met with a man of great age, and either\nsaluted other, and Galahad asked him the castle's name. Fair sir, said\nhe, it is the Castle of Maidens. That is a cursed castle, said Galahad,\nand all they that be conversant therein, for all pity is out thereof,\nand all hardiness and mischief is therein. Therefore, I counsel you, sir\nknight, to turn again. Sir, said Galahad, wit you well I shall not turn\nagain. Then looked Sir Galahad on his arms that nothing failed him,\nand then he put his shield afore him; and anon there met him seven fair\nmaidens, the which said unto him: Sir knight, ye ride here in a great\nfolly, for ye have the water to pass over. Why should I not pass the\nwater? said Galahad. So rode he away from them and met with a squire\nthat said: Knight, those knights in the castle defy you, and defenden\nyou ye go no further till that they wit what ye would. Fair sir, said\nGalahad, I come for to destroy the wicked custom of this castle. Sir,\nan ye will abide by that ye shall have enough to do. Go you now, said\nGalahad, and haste my needs.\n\nThen the squire entered into the castle. And anon after there came out\nof the castle seven knights, and all were brethren. And when they saw\nGalahad they cried: Knight, keep thee, for we assure thee nothing but\ndeath. Why, said Galahad, will ye all have ado with me at once? Yea,\nsaid they, thereto mayst thou trust. Then Galahad put forth his spear\nand smote the foremost to the earth, that near he brake his neck. And\ntherewithal the other smote him on his shield great strokes, so that\ntheir spears brake. Then Sir Galahad drew out his sword, and set upon\nthem so hard that it was marvel to see it, and so through great force\nhe made them to forsake the field; and Galahad chased them till they\nentered into the castle, and so passed through the castle at another\ngate.\n\nAnd there met Sir Galahad an old man clothed in religious clothing, and\nsaid: Sir, have here the keys of this castle. Then Sir Galahad opened\nthe gates, and saw so much people in the streets that he might not\nnumber them, and all said: Sir, ye be welcome, for long have we abiden\nhere our deliverance. Then came to him a gentlewoman and said: These\nknights be fled, but they will come again this night, and here to begin\nagain their evil custom. What will ye that I shall do? said Galahad.\nSir, said the gentlewoman, that ye send after all the knights hither\nthat hold their lands of this castle, and make them to swear for to use\nthe customs that were used heretofore of old time. I will well, said\nGalahad. And there she brought him an horn of ivory, bounden with gold\nrichly, and said: Sir, blow this horn which will be heard two mile about\nthis castle. When Sir Galahad had blown the horn he set him down upon a\nbed.\n\nThen came a priest to Galahad, and said: Sir, it is past a seven year\nagone that these seven brethren came into this castle, and harboured\nwith the lord of this castle that hight the Duke Lianour, and he was\nlord of all this country. And when they espied the duke's daughter,\nthat was a full fair woman, then by their false covin they made debate\nbetwixt themself, and the duke of his goodness would have departed\nthem, and there they slew him and his eldest son. And then they took the\nmaiden and the treasure of the castle. And then by great force they\nheld all the knights of this castle against their will under their\nobeissance, and in great service and truage, robbing and pilling the\npoor common people of all that they had. So it happened on a day the\nduke's daughter said: Ye have done unto me great wrong to slay mine own\nfather, and my brother, and thus to hold our lands: not for then, she\nsaid, ye shall not hold this castle for many years, for by one knight ye\nshall be overcome. Thus she prophesied seven years agone. Well, said the\nseven knights, sithen ye say so, there shall never lady nor knight pass\nthis castle but they shall abide maugre their heads, or die therefore,\ntill that knight be come by whom we shall lose this castle. And\ntherefore is it called the Maidens' Castle, for they have devoured many\nmaidens. Now, said Galahad, is she here for whom this castle was lost?\nNay sir, said the priest, she was dead within these three nights after\nthat she was thus enforced; and sithen have they kept her younger\nsister, which endureth great pains with mo other ladies.\n\nBy this were the knights of the country come, and then he made them do\nhomage and fealty to the king's daughter, and set them in great ease of\nheart. And in the morn there came one to Galahad and told him how that\nGawaine, Gareth, and Uwaine, had slain the seven brethren. I suppose\nwell, said Sir Galahad, and took his armour and his horse, and commended\nthem unto God.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. How Sir Gawaine came to the abbey for to follow Galahad,\nand how he was shriven to a hermit.\n\n\nNOW, saith the tale, after Sir Gawaine departed, he rode many journeys,\nboth toward and froward. And at the last he came to the abbey where Sir\nGalahad had the white shield, and there Sir Gawaine learned the way to\nsewe after Sir Galahad; and so he rode to the abbey where Melias lay\nsick, and there Sir Melias told Sir Gawaine of the marvellous adventures\nthat Sir Galahad did. Certes, said Sir Gawaine, I am not happy that I\ntook not the way that he went, for an I may meet with him I will not\ndepart from him lightly, for all marvellous adventures Sir Galahad\nenchieveth. Sir, said one of the monks, he will not of your fellowship.\nWhy? said Sir Gawaine. Sir, said he, for ye be wicked and sinful, and he\nis full blessed. Right as they thus stood talking there came in riding\nSir Gareth. And then they made joy either of other. And on the morn they\nheard mass, and so departed. And by the way they met with Sir Uwaine les\nAvoutres, and there Sir Uwaine told Sir Gawaine how he had met with none\nadventure sith he departed from the court. Nor we, said Sir Gawaine. And\neither promised other of the three knights not to depart while they were\nin that quest, but if fortune caused it.\n\nSo they departed and rode by fortune till that they came by the Castle\nof Maidens; and there the seven brethren espied the three knights, and\nsaid: Sithen, we be flemed by one knight from this castle, we shall\ndestroy all the knights of King Arthur's that we may overcome, for the\nlove of Sir Galahad. And therewith the seven knights set upon the three\nknights, and by fortune Sir Gawaine slew one of the brethren, and each\none of his fellows slew another, and so slew the remnant. And then they\ntook the way under the castle, and there they lost the way that Sir\nGalahad rode, and there everych of them departed from other; and Sir\nGawaine rode till he came to an hermitage, and there he found the good\nman saying his evensong of Our Lady; and there Sir Gawaine asked harbour\nfor charity, and the good man granted it him gladly.\n\nThen the good man asked him what he was. Sir, he said, I am a knight of\nKing Arthur's that am in the quest of the Sangreal, and my name is Sir\nGawaine. Sir, said the good man, I would wit how it standeth betwixt God\nand you. Sir, said Sir Gawaine, I will with a good will shew you my life\nif it please you; and there he told the hermit how a monk of an abbey\ncalled me wicked knight. He might well say it, said the hermit, for when\nye were first made knight ye should have taken you to knightly deeds\nand virtuous living, and ye have done the contrary, for ye have lived\nmischievously many winters; and Sir Galahad is a maid and sinned never,\nand that is the cause he shall enchieve where he goeth that ye nor none\nsuch shall not attain, nor none in your fellowship, for ye have used the\nmost untruest life that ever I heard knight live. For certes had ye not\nbeen so wicked as ye are, never had the seven brethren been slain by you\nand your two fellows. For Sir Galahad himself alone beat them all seven\nthe day to-fore, but his living is such he shall slay no man lightly.\nAlso I may say you the Castle of Maidens betokeneth the good souls\nthat were in prison afore the Incarnation of Jesu Christ. And the seven\nknights betoken the seven deadly sins that reigned that time in the\nworld; and I may liken the good Galahad unto the son of the High Father,\nthat lighted within a maid, and bought all the souls out of thrall, so\ndid Sir Galahad deliver all the maidens out of the woful castle.\n\nNow, Sir Gawaine, said the good man, thou must do penance for thy sin.\nSir, what penance shall I do? Such as I will give, said the good man.\nNay, said Sir Gawaine, I may do no penance; for we knights adventurous\noft suffer great woe and pain. Well, said the good man, and then he held\nhis peace. And on the morn Sir Gawaine departed from the hermit, and\nbetaught him unto God. And by adventure he met with Sir Aglovale and\nSir Griflet, two knights of the Table Round. And they two rode four days\nwithout finding of any adventure, and at the fifth day they departed.\nAnd everych held as fell them by adventure. Here leaveth the tale of Sir\nGawaine and his fellows, and speak we of Sir Galahad.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. How Sir Galahad met with Sir Launcelot and Sir Percivale,\nand smote them down, and departed from them.\n\nSo when Sir Galahad was departed from the Castle of Maidens he rode till\nhe came to a waste forest, and there he met with Sir Launcelot and Sir\nPercivale, but they knew him not, for he was new disguised. Right so Sir\nLauncelot, his father, dressed his spear and brake it upon Sir Galahad,\nand Galahad smote him so again that he smote down horse and man. And\nthen he drew his sword, and dressed him unto Sir Percivale, and smote\nhim so on the helm, that it rove to the coif of steel; and had not the\nsword swerved Sir Percivale had been slain, and with the stroke he fell\nout of his saddle. This jousts was done to-fore the hermitage where a\nrecluse dwelled. And when she saw Sir Galahad ride, she said: God be\nwith thee, best knight of the world. Ah certes, said she, all aloud that\nLauncelot and Percivale might hear it: An yonder two knights had known\nthee as well as I do they would not have encountered with thee. Then Sir\nGalahad heard her say so he was adread to be known: therewith he smote\nhis horse with his spurs and rode a great pace froward them. Then\nperceived they both that he was Galahad; and up they gat on their\nhorses, and rode fast after him, but in a while he was out of their\nsight. And then they turned again with heavy cheer. Let us spere some\ntidings, said Percivale, at yonder recluse. Do as ye list, said Sir\nLauncelot.\n\nWhen Sir Percivale came to the recluse she knew him well enough, and Sir\nLauncelot both. But Sir Launcelot rode overthwart and endlong in a wild\nforest, and held no path but as wild adventure led him. And at the last\nhe came to a stony cross which departed two ways in waste land; and by\nthe cross was a stone that was of marble, but it was so dark that Sir\nLauncelot might not wit what it was. Then Sir Launcelot looked by him,\nand saw an old chapel, and there he weened to have found people; and Sir\nLauncelot tied his horse till a tree, and there he did off his shield\nand hung it upon a tree, and then went to the chapel door, and found it\nwaste and broken. And within he found a fair altar, full richly arrayed\nwith cloth of clean silk, and there stood a fair clean candlestick,\nwhich bare six great candles, and the candlestick was of silver. And\nwhen Sir Launcelot saw this light he had great will for to enter into\nthe chapel, but he could find no place where he might enter; then was he\npassing heavy and dismayed. Then he returned and came to his horse and\ndid off his saddle and bridle, and let him pasture, and unlaced his\nhelm, and ungirt his sword, and laid him down to sleep upon his shield\nto-fore the cross.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. How Sir Launcelot, half sleeping and half waking, saw a\nsick man borne in a litter, and how he was healed with the Sangreal.\n\n\nAND so he fell asleep; and half waking and sleeping he saw come by him\ntwo palfreys all fair and white, the which bare a litter, therein lying\na sick knight. And when he was nigh the cross he there abode still. All\nthis Sir Launcelot saw and beheld, for he slept not verily; and he heard\nhim say: O sweet Lord, when shall this sorrow leave me? and when shall\nthe holy vessel come by me, wherethrough I shall be blessed? For I have\nendured thus long, for little trespass. A full great while complained\nthe knight thus, and always Sir Launcelot heard it. With that Sir\nLauncelot saw the candlestick with the six tapers come before the cross,\nand he saw nobody that brought it. Also there came a table of silver,\nand the holy vessel of the Sangreal, which Launcelot had seen aforetime\nin King Pescheour's house. And therewith the sick knight set him up, and\nheld up both his hands, and said: Fair sweet Lord, which is here within\nthis holy vessel; take heed unto me that I may be whole of this malady.\nAnd therewith on his hands and on his knees he went so nigh that he\ntouched the holy vessel and kissed it, and anon he was whole; and then\nhe said: Lord God, I thank thee, for I am healed of this sickness.\n\nSo when the holy vessel had been there a great while it went unto the\nchapel with the chandelier and the light, so that Launcelot wist not\nwhere it was become; for he was overtaken with sin that he had no power\nto rise again the holy vessel; wherefore after that many men said of him\nshame, but he took repentance after that. Then the sick knight dressed\nhim up and kissed the cross; anon his squire brought him his arms, and\nasked his lord how he did. Certes, said he, I thank God right well,\nthrough the holy vessel I am healed. But I have marvel of this sleeping\nknight that had no power to awake when this holy vessel was brought\nhither. I dare right well say, said the squire, that he dwelleth in some\ndeadly sin whereof he was never confessed. By my faith, said the knight,\nwhatsomever he be he is unhappy, for as I deem he is of the fellowship\nof the Round Table, the which is entered into the quest of the Sangreal.\nSir, said the squire, here I have brought you all your arms save your\nhelm and your sword, and therefore by mine assent now may ye take this\nknight's helm and his sword: and so he did. And when he was clean\narmed he took Sir Launcelot's horse, for he was better than his; and so\ndeparted they from the cross.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. How a voice spake to Sir Launcelot, and how he found his\nhorse and his helm borne away, and after went afoot.\n\n\nTHEN anon Sir Launcelot waked, and set him up, and bethought him what he\nhad seen there, and whether it were dreams or not. Right so heard he a\nvoice that said: Sir Launcelot, more harder than is the stone, and more\nbitter than is the wood, and more naked and barer than is the leaf of\nthe fig tree; therefore go thou from hence, and withdraw thee from this\nholy place. And when Sir Launcelot heard this he was passing heavy and\nwist not what to do, and so departed sore weeping, and cursed the time\nthat he was born. For then he deemed never to have had worship more. For\nthose words went to his heart, till that he knew wherefore he was called\nso. Then Sir Launcelot went to the cross and found his helm, his sword,\nand his horse taken away. And then he called himself a very wretch, and\nmost unhappy of all knights; and there he said: My sin and my wickedness\nhave brought me unto great dishonour. For when I sought worldly\nadventures for worldly desires, I ever enchieved them and had the better\nin every place, and never was I discomfit in no quarrel, were it right\nor wrong. And now I take upon me the adventures of holy things, and now\nI see and understand that mine old sin hindereth me and shameth me, so\nthat I had no power to stir nor speak when the holy blood appeared afore\nme. So thus he sorrowed till it was day, and heard the fowls sing: then\nsomewhat he was comforted. But when Sir Launcelot missed his horse and\nhis harness then he wist well God was displeased with him.\n\nThen he departed from the cross on foot into a forest; and so by prime\nhe came to an high hill, and found an hermitage and a hermit therein\nwhich was going unto mass. And then Launcelot kneeled down and cried\non Our Lord mercy for his wicked works. So when mass was done Launcelot\ncalled him, and prayed him for charity for to hear his life. With a good\nwill, said the good man. Sir, said he, be ye of King Arthur's court and\nof the fellowship of the Round Table? Yea forsooth, and my name is Sir\nLauncelot du Lake that hath been right well said of, and now my good\nfortune is changed, for I am the most wretch of the world. The hermit\nbeheld him and had marvel how he was so abashed. Sir, said the hermit,\nye ought to thank God more than any knight living, for He hath caused\nyou to have more worldly worship than any knight that now liveth. And\nfor your presumption to take upon you in deadly sin for to be in His\npresence, where His flesh and His blood was, that caused you ye might\nnot see it with worldly eyes; for He will not appear where such sinners\nbe, but if it be unto their great hurt and unto their great shame; and\nthere is no knight living now that ought to give God so great thank as\nye, for He hath given you beauty, seemliness, and great strength above\nall other knights; and therefore ye are the more beholding unto God than\nany other man, to love Him and dread Him, for your strength and manhood\nwill little avail you an God be against you.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. How Sir Launcelot was shriven, and what sorrow he made and\nof the good ensamples which were shewed him.\n\n\nTHEN Sir Launcelot wept with heavy cheer, and said: Now I know well ye\nsay me sooth. Sir, said the good man, hide none old sin from me. Truly,\nsaid Sir Launcelot, that were me full loath to discover. For this\nfourteen year I never discovered one thing that I have used, and that\nmay I now wite my shame and my disadventure. And then he told there that\ngood man all his life. And how he had loved a queen unmeasurably and out\nof measure long. And all my great deeds of arms that I have done, I\ndid for the most part for the queen's sake, and for her sake would I do\nbattle were it right or wrong, and never did I battle all only for God's\nsake, but for to win worship and to cause me to be the better beloved\nand little or nought I thanked God of it. Then Sir Launcelot said: I\npray you counsel me. I will counsel you, said the hermit, if ye will\nensure me that ye will never come in that queen's fellowship as much\nas ye may forbear. And then Sir Launcelot promised him he nold, by the\nfaith of his body. Look that your heart and your mouth accord, said the\ngood man, and I shall ensure you ye shall have more worship than ever ye\nhad.\n\nHoly father, said Sir Launcelot, I marvel of the voice that said to me\nmarvellous words, as ye have heard to-forehand. Have ye no marvel, said\nthe good man thereof, for it seemeth well God loveth you; for men may\nunderstand a stone is hard of kind, and namely one more than another;\nand that is to understand by thee, Sir Launcelot, for thou wilt not\nleave thy sin for no goodness that God hath sent thee; therefore thou\nart more than any stone, and never wouldst thou be made nesh nor by\nwater nor by fire, and that is the heat of the Holy Ghost may not enter\nin thee. Now take heed, in all the world men shall not find one knight\nto whom Our Lord hath given so much of grace as He hath given you, for\nHe hath given you fairness with seemliness, He hath given thee wit,\ndiscretion to know good from evil, He hath given thee prowess and\nhardiness, and given thee to work so largely that thou hast had at all\ndays the better wheresomever thou came; and now Our Lord will suffer\nthee no longer, but that thou shalt know Him whether thou wilt or nylt.\nAnd why the voice called thee bitterer than wood, for where overmuch sin\ndwelleth, there may be but little sweetness, wherefore thou art likened\nto an old rotten tree.\n\nNow have I shewed thee why thou art harder than the stone and bitterer\nthan the tree. Now shall I shew thee why thou art more naked and barer\nthan the fig tree. It befell that Our Lord on Palm Sunday preached\nin Jerusalem, and there He found in the people that all hardness was\nharboured in them, and there He found in all the town not one that would\nharbour him. And then He went without the town, and found in midst\nof the way a fig tree, the which was right fair and well garnished of\nleaves, but fruit had it none. Then Our Lord cursed the tree that bare\nno fruit; that betokeneth the fig tree unto Jerusalem, that had leaves\nand no fruit. So thou, Sir Launcelot, when the Holy Grail was brought\nafore thee, He found in thee no fruit, nor good thought nor good will,\nand defouled with lechery. Certes, said Sir Launcelot, all that you\nhave said is true, and from henceforward I cast me, by the grace of God,\nnever to be so wicked as I have been, but as to follow knighthood and to\ndo feats of arms.\n\nThen the good man enjoined Sir Launcelot such penance as he might do\nand to sewe knighthood, and so assoiled him, and prayed Sir Launcelot to\nabide with him all that day. I will well, said Sir Launcelot, for I have\nneither helm, nor horse, nor sword. As for that, said the good man, I\nshall help you or to-morn at even of an horse, and all that longed unto\nyou. And then Sir Launcelot repented him greatly.\n\n_Here endeth off the history of Sir Launcelot. And here followeth of Sir\nPercivale de Galis, which is the fourteenth book._\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XIV.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. How Sir Percivale came to a recluse and asked counsel, and\nhow she told him that she was his aunt.\n\n\nNOW saith the tale, that when Sir Launcelot was ridden after Sir\nGalahad, the which had all these adventures above said, Sir Percivale\nturned again unto the recluse, where he deemed to have tidings of that\nknight that Launcelot followed. And so he kneeled at her window, and the\nrecluse opened it and asked Sir Percivale what he would. Madam, he said,\nI am a knight of King Arthur's court, and my name is Sir Percivale de\nGalis. When the recluse heard his name she had great joy of him, for\nmickle she had loved him to-fore any other knight, for she ought to do\nso, for she was his aunt. And then she commanded the gates to be opened,\nand there he had all the cheer that she might make him, and all that was\nin her power was at his commandment.\n\nSo on the morn Sir Percivale went to the recluse and asked her if she\nknew that knight with the white shield. Sir, said she, why would ye wit?\nTruly, madam, said Sir Percivale, I shall never be well at ease till\nthat I know of that knight's fellowship, and that I may fight with\nhim, for I may not leave him so lightly, for I have the shame yet. Ah,\nPercivale, said she, would ye fight with him? I see well ye have great\nwill to be slain as your father was, through outrageousness. Madam, said\nSir Percivale, it seemeth by your words that ye know me. Yea, said she,\nI well ought to know you, for I am your aunt, although I be in a priory\nplace. For some called me sometime the Queen of the Waste Lands, and\nI was called the queen of most riches in the world; and it pleased me\nnever my riches so much as doth my poverty. Then Sir Percivale wept for\nvery pity when that he knew it was his aunt. Ah, fair nephew, said she,\nwhen heard ye tidings of your mother? Truly, said he, I heard none\nof her, but I dream of her much in my sleep; and therefore I wot not\nwhether she be dead or alive. Certes, fair nephew, said she, your mother\nis dead, for after your departing from her she took such a sorrow that\nanon, after she was confessed, she died. Now, God have mercy on her\nsoul, said Sir Percivale, it sore forthinketh me; but all we must change\nthe life. Now, fair aunt, tell me what is the knight? I deem it be he\nthat bare the red arms on Whitsunday. Wit you well, said she, that this\nis he, for otherwise ought he not to do, but to go in red arms; and that\nsame knight hath no peer, for he worketh all by miracle, and he shall\nnever be overcome of none earthly man's hand.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. How Merlin likened the Round Table to the world, and how the\nknights that should achieve the Sangreal should be known.\n\n\nALSO Merlin made the Round Table in tokening of roundness of the world,\nfor by the Round Table is the world signified by right, for all the\nworld, Christian and heathen, repair unto the Round Table; and when they\nare chosen to be of the fellowship of the Round Table they think them\nmore blessed and more in worship than if they had gotten half the world;\nand ye have seen that they have lost their fathers and their mothers,\nand all their kin, and their wives and their children, for to be of your\nfellowship. It is well seen by you; for since ye have departed from your\nmother ye would never see her, ye found such fellowship at the Round\nTable. When Merlin had ordained the Round Table he said, by them which\nshould be fellows of the Round Table the truth of the Sangreal should be\nwell known. And men asked him how men might know them that should best\ndo and to enchieve the Sangreal? Then he said there should be three\nwhite bulls that should enchieve it, and the two should be maidens, and\nthe third should be chaste. And that one of the three should pass his\nfather as much as the lion passeth the leopard, both of strength and\nhardiness.\n\nThey that heard Merlin say so said thus unto Merlin: Sithen there shall\nbe such a knight, thou shouldest ordain by thy crafts a siege, that no\nman should sit in it but he all only that shall pass all other knights.\nThen Merlin answered that he would do so. And then he made the Siege\nPerilous, in the which Galahad sat in at his meat on Whitsunday last\npast. Now, madam, said Sir Percivale, so much have I heard of you that\nby my good will I will never have ado with Sir Galahad but by way of\nkindness; and for God's love, fair aunt, can ye teach me some way\nwhere I may find him? for much would I love the fellowship of him. Fair\nnephew, said she, ye must ride unto a castle the which is called Goothe,\nwhere he hath a cousin-germain, and there may ye be lodged this night.\nAnd as he teacheth you, seweth after as fast as ye can; and if he can\ntell you no tidings of him, ride straight unto the Castle of Carbonek,\nwhere the maimed king is there lying, for there shall ye hear true\ntidings of him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. How Sir Percivale came into a monastery, where he found\nKing Evelake, which was an old man.\n\n\nTHEN departed Sir Percivale from his aunt, either making great sorrow.\nAnd so he rode till evensong time. And then he heard a clock smite; and\nthen he was ware of an house closed well with walls and deep ditches,\nand there he knocked at the gate and was let in, and he alighted and was\nled unto a chamber, and soon he was unarmed. And there he had right\ngood cheer all that night; and on the morn he heard his mass, and in the\nmonastery he found a priest ready at the altar. And on the right side he\nsaw a pew closed with iron, and behind the altar he saw a rich bed and a\nfair, as of cloth of silk and gold.\n\nThen Sir Percivale espied that therein was a man or a woman, for the\nvisage was covered; then he left off his looking and heard his service.\nAnd when it came to the sacring, he that lay within that parclos dressed\nhim up, and uncovered his head; and then him beseemed a passing old man,\nand he had a crown of gold upon his head, and his shoulders were naked\nand unhilled unto his navel. And then Sir Percivale espied his body was\nfull of great wounds, both on the shoulders, arms, and visage. And ever\nhe held up his hands against Our Lord's body, and cried: Fair, sweet\nFather, Jesu Christ, forget not me. And so he lay down, but always he\nwas in his prayers and orisons; and him seemed to be of the age of three\nhundred winter. And when the mass was done the priest took Our Lord's\nbody and bare it to the sick king. And when he had used it he did off\nhis crown, and commanded the crown to be set on the altar.\n\nThen Sir Percivale asked one of the brethren what he was. Sir, said the\ngood man, ye have heard much of Joseph of Aramathie, how he was sent by\nJesu Christ into this land for to teach and preach the holy Christian\nfaith; and therefore he suffered many persecutions the which the enemies\nof Christ did unto him, and in the city of Sarras he converted a king\nwhose name was Evelake. And so this king came with Joseph into this\nland, and ever he was busy to be thereas the Sangreal was; and on a time\nhe nighed it so nigh that Our Lord was displeased with him, but ever he\nfollowed it more and more, till God struck him almost blind. Then this\nking cried mercy, and said: Fair Lord, let me never die till the good\nknight of my blood of the ninth degree be come, that I may see him\nopenly that he shall enchieve the Sangreal, that I may kiss him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. How Sir Percivale saw many men of arms bearing a dead\nknight, and how he fought against them.\n\n\nWHEN the king thus had made his prayers he heard a voice that said:\nHeard be thy prayers, for thou shalt not die till he have kissed thee.\nAnd when that knight shall come the clearness of your eyes shall come\nagain, and thou shalt see openly, and thy wounds shall be healed, and\nerst shall they never close. And this befell of King Evelake, and this\nsame king hath lived this three hundred winters this holy life, and men\nsay the knight is in the court that shall heal him. Sir, said the good\nman, I pray you tell me what knight that ye be, and if ye be of King\nArthur's court and of the Table Round. Yea forsooth, said he, and my\nname is Sir Percivale de Galis. And when the good man understood his\nname he made great joy of him.\n\nAnd then Sir Percivale departed and rode till the hour of noon. And\nhe met in a valley about a twenty men of arms, which bare in a bier a\nknight deadly slain. And when they saw Sir Percivale they asked him of\nwhence he was. And he answered: Of the court of King Arthur. Then they\ncried all at once: Slay him. Then Sir Percivale smote the first to the\nearth and his horse upon him. And then seven of the knights smote upon\nhis shield all at once, and the remnant slew his horse so that he\nfell to the earth. So had they slain him or taken him had not the good\nknight, Sir Galahad, with the red arms come there by adventure into\nthose parts. And when he saw all those knights upon one knight he cried:\nSave me that knight's life. And then he dressed him toward the twenty\nmen of arms as fast as his horse might drive, with his spear in the\nrest, and smote the foremost horse and man to the earth. And when his\nspear was broken he set his hand to his sword, and smote on the right\nhand and on the left hand that it was marvel to see, and at every stroke\nhe smote one down or put him to a rebuke, so that they would fight no\nmore but fled to a thick forest, and Sir Galahad followed them.\n\nAnd when Sir Percivale saw him chase them so, he made great sorrow that\nhis horse was away. And then he wist well it was Sir Galahad. And then\nhe cried aloud: Ah fair knight, abide and suffer me to do thankings unto\nthee, for much have ye done for me. But ever Sir Galahad rode so\nfast that at the last he passed out of his sight. And as fast as Sir\nPercivale might he went after him on foot, crying. And then he met with\na yeoman riding upon an hackney, the which led in his hand a great steed\nblacker than any bear. Ah, fair friend, said Sir Percivale, as ever I\nmay do for you, and to be your true knight in the first place ye will\nrequire me, that ye will lend me that black steed, that I might overtake\na knight the which rideth afore me. Sir knight, said the yeoman, I pray\nyou hold me excused of that, for that I may not do. For wit ye well, the\nhorse is such a man's horse, that an I lent it you or any man, that he\nwould slay me. Alas, said Sir Percivale, I had never so great sorrow as\nI have had for losing of yonder knight. Sir, said the yeoman, I am right\nheavy for you, for a good horse would beseem you well; but I dare not\ndeliver you this horse but if ye would take him from me. That will I not\ndo, said Sir Percivale. And so they departed; and Sir Percivale set him\ndown under a tree, and made sorrow out of measure. And as he was there,\nthere came a knight riding on the horse that the yeoman led, and he was\nclean armed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. How a yeoman desired him to get again an horse, and how Sir\nPercivale's hackney was slain, and how he gat an horse.\n\n\nAND anon the yeoman came pricking after as fast as ever he might, and\nasked Sir Percivale if he saw any knight riding on his black steed. Yea,\nsir, forsooth, said he; why, sir, ask ye me that? Ah, sir, that steed\nhe hath benome me with strength; wherefore my lord will slay me in what\nplace he findeth me. Well, said Sir Percivale, what wouldst thou that\nI did? Thou seest well that I am on foot, but an I had a good horse I\nshould bring him soon again. Sir, said the yeoman, take mine hackney\nand do the best ye can, and I shall sewe you on foot to wit how that ye\nshall speed. Then Sir Percivale alighted upon that hackney, and rode as\nfast as he might, and at the last he saw that knight. And then he\ncried: Knight, turn again; and he turned and set his spear against Sir\nPercivale, and he smote the hackney in the midst of the breast that\nhe fell down dead to the earth, and there he had a great fall, and the\nother rode his way. And then Sir Percivale was wood wroth, and cried:\nAbide, wicked knight; coward and false-hearted knight, turn again and\nfight with me on foot. But he answered not, but passed on his way.\n\nWhen Sir Percivale saw he would not turn he cast away his helm and\nsword, and said: Now am I a very wretch, cursed and most unhappy above\nall other knights. So in this sorrow he abode all that day till it was\nnight; and then he was faint, and laid him down and slept till it was\nmidnight; and then he awaked and saw afore him a woman which said unto\nhim right fiercely: Sir Percivale, what dost thou here? He answered, I\ndo neither good nor great ill. If thou wilt ensure me, said she, that\nthou wilt fulfil my will when I summon thee, I shall lend thee mine own\nhorse which shall bear thee whither thou wilt. Sir Percivale was glad\nof her proffer, and ensured her to fulfil all her desire. Then abide me\nhere, and I shall go and fetch you an horse. And so she came soon again\nand brought an horse with her that was inly black. When Percivale beheld\nthat horse he marvelled that it was so great and so well apparelled; and\nnot for then he was so hardy, and he leapt upon him, and took none heed\nof himself. And so anon as he was upon him he thrust to him with his\nspurs, and so he rode by a forest, and the moon shone clear. And within\nan hour and less he bare him four days' journey thence, until he came to\na rough water the which roared, and his horse would have borne him into\nit.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. Of the great danger that Sir Percivale was in by his horse,\nand how he saw a serpent and a lion fight.\n\n\nAND when Sir Percivale came nigh the brim, and saw the water so\nboistous, he doubted to overpass it. And then he made a sign of the\ncross in his forehead. When the fiend felt him so charged he shook off\nSir Percivale, and he went into the water crying and roaring, making\ngreat sorrow, and it seemed unto him that the water brent. Then Sir\nPercivale perceived it was a fiend, the which would have brought him\nunto his perdition. Then he commended himself unto God, and prayed Our\nLord to keep him from all such temptations; and so he prayed all that\nnight till on the morn that it was day; then he saw that he was in a\nwild mountain the which was closed with the sea nigh all about, that he\nmight see no land about him which might relieve him, but wild beasts.\n\nAnd then he went into a valley, and there he saw a young serpent bring a\nyoung lion by the neck, and so he came by Sir Percivale. With that came\na great lion crying and roaring after the serpent. And as fast as Sir\nPercivale saw this he marvelled, and hied him thither, but anon the\nlion had overtaken the serpent and began battle with him. And then Sir\nPercivale thought to help the lion, for he was the more natural beast of\nthe two; and therewith he drew his sword, and set his shield afore him,\nand there he gave the serpent such a buffet that he had a deadly wound.\nWhen the lion saw that, he made no resemblaunt to fight with him, but\nmade him all the cheer that a beast might make a man. Then Percivale\nperceived that, and cast down his shield which was broken; and then he\ndid off his helm for to gather wind, for he was greatly enchafed with\nthe serpent: and the lion went alway about him fawning as a spaniel.\nAnd then he stroked him on the neck and on the shoulders. And then he\nthanked God of the fellowship of that beast. And about noon the lion\ntook his little whelp and trussed him and bare him there he came from.\n\nThen was Sir Percivale alone. And as the tale telleth, he was one of\nthe men of the world at that time which most believed in Our Lord Jesu\nChrist, for in those days there were but few folks that believed in God\nperfectly. For in those days the son spared not the father no more than\na stranger. And so Sir Percivale comforted himself in our Lord Jesu, and\nbesought God no temptation should bring him out of God's service, but to\nendure as his true champion. Thus when Sir Percivale had prayed he saw\nthe lion come toward him, and then he couched down at his feet. And so\nall that night the lion and he slept together; and when Sir Percivale\nslept he dreamed a marvellous dream, that there two ladies met with him,\nand that one sat upon a lion, and that other sat upon a serpent, and\nthat one of them was young, and the other was old; and the youngest him\nthought said: Sir Percivale, my lord saluteth thee, and sendeth thee\nword that thou array thee and make thee ready, for to-morn thou must\nfight with the strongest champion of the world. And if thou be overcome\nthou shall not be quit for losing of any of thy members, but thou shalt\nbe shamed for ever to the world's end. And then he asked her what was\nher lord. And she said the greatest lord of all the world: and so she\ndeparted suddenly that he wist not where.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. Of the vision that Sir Percivale saw, and how his vision\nwas expounded, and of his lion.\n\n\nTHEN came forth the other lady that rode upon the serpent, and she said:\nSir Percivale, I complain me of you that ye have done unto me, and have\nnot offended unto you. Certes, madam, he said, unto you nor no lady I\nnever offended. Yes, said she, I shall tell you why. I have nourished in\nthis place a great while a serpent, which served me a great while, and\nyesterday ye slew him as he gat his prey. Say me for what cause ye slew\nhim, for the lion was not yours. Madam, said Sir Percivale, I know well\nthe lion was not mine, but I did it for the lion is of more gentler\nnature than the serpent, and therefore I slew him; meseemeth I did not\namiss against you. Madam, said he, what would ye that I did? I would,\nsaid she, for the amends of my beast that ye become my man. And then he\nanswered: That will I not grant you. No, said she, truly ye were never\nbut my servant sin ye received the homage of Our Lord Jesu Christ.\nTherefore, I ensure you in what place I may find you without keeping I\nshall take you, as he that sometime was my man. And so she departed from\nSir Percivale and left him sleeping, the which was sore travailed of his\nadvision. And on the morn he arose and blessed him, and he was passing\nfeeble.\n\nThen was Sir Percivale ware in the sea, and saw a ship come sailing\ntoward him; and Sir Percivale went unto the ship and found it covered\nwithin and without with white samite. And at the board stood an old man\nclothed in a surplice, in likeness of a priest. Sir, said Sir Percivale,\nye be welcome. God keep you, said the good man. Sir, said the old man,\nof whence be ye? Sir, said Sir Percivale, I am of King Arthur's court,\nand a knight of the Table Round, the which am in the quest of the\nSangreal; and here am I in great duresse, and never like to escape out\nof this wilderness. Doubt not, said the good man, an ye be so true a\nknight as the order of chivalry requireth, and of heart as ye ought to\nbe, ye should not doubt that none enemy should slay you. What are ye?\nsaid Sir Percivale. Sir, said the old man, I am of a strange country,\nand hither I come to comfort you.\n\nSir, said Sir Percivale, what signifieth my dream that I dreamed this\nnight? And there he told him altogether: She which rode upon the lion\nbetokeneth the new law of holy church, that is to understand, faith,\ngood hope, belief, and baptism. For she seemed younger than the other it\nis great reason, for she was born in the resurrection and the passion of\nOur Lord Jesu Christ. And for great love she came to thee to warn\nthee of thy great battle that shall befall thee. With whom, said Sir\nPercivale, shall I fight? With the most champion of the world, said the\nold man; for as the lady said, but if thou quit thee well thou shalt not\nbe quit by losing of one member, but thou shalt be shamed to the world's\nend. And she that rode on the serpent signifieth the old law, and that\nserpent betokeneth a fiend. And why she blamed thee that thou slewest\nher servant, it betokeneth nothing; the serpent that thou slewest\nbetokeneth the devil that thou rodest upon to the rock. And when thou\nmadest a sign of the cross, there thou slewest him, and put away his\npower. And when she asked thee amends and to become her man, and thou\nsaidst thou wouldst not, that was to make thee to believe on her and\nleave thy baptism. So he commanded Sir Percivale to depart, and so\nhe leapt over the board and the ship, and all went away he wist not\nwhither. Then he went up unto the rock and found the lion which always\nkept him fellowship, and he stroked him upon the back and had great joy\nof him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. How Sir Percivale saw a ship coming to him-ward, and how\nthe lady of the ship told him of her disheritance.\n\n\nBY that Sir Percivale had abiden there till mid-day he saw a ship came\nrowing in the sea, as all the wind of the world had driven it. And so\nit drove under that rock. And when Sir Percivale saw this he hied him\nthither, and found the ship covered with silk more blacker than any\nbear, and therein was a gentlewoman of great beauty, and she was clothed\nrichly that none might be better. And when she saw Sir Percivale she\nsaid: Who brought you in this wilderness where ye be never like to pass\nhence, for ye shall die here for hunger and mischief? Damosel, said Sir\nPercivale, I serve the best man of the world, and in his service he will\nnot suffer me to die, for who that knocketh shall enter, and who that\nasketh shall have, and who that seeketh him he hideth him not. But then\nshe said: Sir Percivale, wot ye what I am? Yea, said he. Now who taught\nyou my name? said she. Now, said Sir Percivale, I know you better than\nye ween. And I came out of the waste forest where I found the Red Knight\nwith the white shield, said the damosel. Ah, damosel, said he, with\nthat knight would I meet passing fain. Sir knight, said she, an ye will\nensure me by the faith that ye owe unto knighthood that ye shall do my\nwill what time I summon you, and I shall bring you unto that knight.\nYea, said he, I shall promise you to fulfil your desire. Well, said she,\nnow shall I tell you. I saw him in the forest chasing two knights unto\na water, the which is called Mortaise; and they drove him into the water\nfor dread of death, and the two knights passed over, and the Red Knight\npassed after, and there his horse was drenched, and he, through great\nstrength, escaped unto the land: thus she told him, and Sir Percivale\nwas passing glad thereof.\n\nThen she asked him if he had ate any meat late. Nay, madam, truly I ate\nno meat nigh this three days, but late here I spake with a good man that\nfed me with his good words and holy, and refreshed me greatly. Ah, sir\nknight, said she, that same man is an enchanter and a multiplier of\nwords. For an ye believe him ye shall plainly be shamed, and die in this\nrock for pure hunger, and be eaten with wild beasts; and ye be a young\nman and a goodly knight, and I shall help you an ye will. What are ye,\nsaid Sir Percivale, that proffered me thus great kindness? I am, said\nshe, a gentlewoman that am disherited, which was sometime the richest\nwoman of the world. Damosel, said Sir Percivale, who hath disherited\nyou? for I have great pity of you. Sir, said she, I dwelled with the\ngreatest man of the world, and he made me so fair and clear that there\nwas none like me; and of that great beauty I had a little pride more\nthan I ought to have had. Also I said a word that pleased him not. And\nthen he would not suffer me to be any longer in his company, and so\ndrove me from mine heritage, and so disherited me, and he had never\npity of me nor of none of my council, nor of my court. And sithen, sir\nknight, it hath befallen me so, and through me and mine I have benome\nhim many of his men, and made them to become my men. For they ask never\nnothing of me but I give it them, that and much more. Thus I and all my\nservants were against him night and day. Therefore I know now no good\nknight, nor no good man, but I get them on my side an I may. And for\nthat I know that thou art a good knight, I beseech you to help me; and\nfor ye be a fellow of the Round Table, wherefore ye ought not to fail no\ngentlewoman which is disherited, an she besought you of help.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. How Sir Percivale promised her help, and how he required her\nof love, and how he was saved from the fiend.\n\n\nTHEN Sir Percivale promised her all the help that he might; and then she\nthanked him. And at that time the weather was hot. Then she called unto\nher a gentlewoman and bade her bring forth a pavilion; and so she did,\nand pight it upon the gravel. Sir, said she, now may ye rest you in this\nheat of the day. Then he thanked her, and she put off his helm and his\nshield, and there he slept a great while. And then he awoke and asked\nher if she had any meat, and she said: Yea, also ye shall have enough.\nAnd so there was set enough upon the table, and thereon so much that he\nhad marvel, for there was all manner of meats that he could think on.\nAlso he drank there the strongest wine that ever he drank, him thought,\nand therewith he was a little chafed more than he ought to be; with that\nhe beheld the gentlewoman, and him thought she was the fairest creature\nthat ever he saw. And then Sir Percivale proffered her love, and prayed\nher that she would be his. Then she refused him, in a manner, when he\nrequired her, for the cause he should be the more ardent on her, and\never he ceased not to pray her of love. And when she saw him well\nenchafed, then she said: Sir Percivale, wit you well I shall not fulfil\nyour will but if ye swear from henceforth ye shall be my true servant,\nand to do nothing but that I shall command you. Will ye ensure me this\nas ye be a true knight? Yea, said he, fair lady, by the faith of my\nbody. Well, said she, now shall ye do with me whatso it please you; and\nnow wit ye well ye are the knight in the world that I have most desire\nto.\n\nAnd then two squires were commanded to make a bed in midst of the\npavilion. And anon she was unclothed and laid therein. And then Sir\nPercivale laid him down by her naked; and by adventure and grace he saw\nhis sword lie on the ground naked, in whose pommel was a red cross and\nthe sign of the crucifix therein, and bethought him on his knighthood\nand his promise made to-forehand unto the good man; then he made a\nsign of the cross in his forehead, and therewith the pavilion turned\nup-so-down, and then it changed unto a smoke, and a black cloud, and\nthen he was adread and cried aloud:\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. How Sir Percivale for penance rove himself through the thigh;\nand how she was known for the devil.\n\n\nFAIR sweet Father, Jesu Christ, ne let me not be shamed, the which was\nnigh lost had not thy good grace been. And then he looked into a ship,\nand saw her enter therein, which said: Sir Percivale, ye have betrayed\nme. And so she went with the wind roaring and yelling, that it seemed\nall the water brent after her. Then Sir Percivale made great sorrow,\nand drew his sword unto him, saying: Sithen my flesh will be my master\nI shall punish it; and therewith he rove himself through the thigh\nthat the blood stert about him, and said: O good Lord, take this in\nrecompensation of that I have done against thee, my Lord. So then he\nclothed him and armed him, and called himself a wretch, saying: How nigh\nwas I lost, and to have lost that I should never have gotten again, that\nwas my virginity, for that may never be recovered after it is once lost.\nAnd then he stopped his bleeding wound with a piece of his shirt.\n\nThus as he made his moan he saw the same ship come from Orient that the\ngood man was in the day afore, and the noble knight was ashamed with\nhimself, and therewith he fell in a swoon. And when he awoke he went\nunto him weakly, and there he saluted this good man. And then he asked\nSir Percivale: How hast thou done sith I departed? Sir, said he, here\nwas a gentlewoman and led me into deadly sin. And there he told him\naltogether. Knew ye not the maid? said the good man. Sir, said he, nay,\nbut well I wot the fiend sent her hither to shame me. O good knight,\nsaid he, thou art a fool, for that gentlewoman was the master fiend of\nhell, the which hath power above all devils, and that was the old lady\nthat thou sawest in thine advision riding on the serpent. Then he told\nSir Percivale how our Lord Jesu Christ beat him out of heaven for his\nsin, the which was the most brightest angel of heaven, and therefore he\nlost his heritage. And that was the champion that thou foughtest withal,\nthe which had overcome thee had not the grace of God been. Now beware\nSir Percivale, and take this for an ensample. And then the good man\nvanished away. Then Sir Percivale took his arms, and entered into the\nship, and so departed from thence.\n\n_Here endeth the fourteenth book, which is of Sir Percivale. And here\nfolloweth of Sir Launcelot, which is the fifteenth book._\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XV.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. How Sir Launcelot came to a chapel, where he found dead, in a\nwhite shirt, a man of religion, of an hundred winter old.\n\n\nWHEN the hermit had kept Sir Launcelot three days, the hermit gat him\nan horse, an helm, and a sword. And then he departed about the hour of\nnoon. And then he saw a little house. And when he came near he saw a\nchapel, and there beside he saw an old man that was clothed all in white\nfull richly; and then Sir Launcelot said: God save you. God keep you,\nsaid the good man, and make you a good knight. Then Sir Launcelot\nalighted and entered into the chapel, and there he saw an old man dead,\nin a white shirt of passing fine cloth.\n\nSir, said the good man, this man that is dead ought not to be in such\nclothing as ye see him in, for in that he brake the oath of his order,\nfor he hath been more than an hundred winter a man of a religion. And\nthen the good man and Sir Launcelot went into the chapel; and the good\nman took a stole about his neck, and a book, and then he conjured on\nthat book; and with that they saw in an hideous figure and horrible,\nthat there was no man so hard-hearted nor so hard but he should have\nbeen afeard. Then said the fiend: Thou hast travailed me greatly; now\ntell me what thou wilt with me. I will, said the good man, that thou\ntell me how my fellow became dead, and whether he be saved or damned.\nThen he said with an horrible voice: He is not lost but saved. How may\nthat be? said the good man; it seemed to me that he lived not well, for\nhe brake his order for to wear a shirt where he ought to wear none, and\nwho that trespasseth against our order doth not well. Not so, said the\nfiend, this man that lieth here dead was come of a great lineage.\nAnd there was a lord that hight the Earl de Vale, that held great war\nagainst this man's nephew, the which hight Aguarus. And so this Aguarus\nsaw the earl was bigger than he. Then he went for to take counsel of his\nuncle, the which lieth here dead as ye may see. And then he asked leave,\nand went out of his hermitage for to maintain his nephew against the\nmighty earl; and so it happed that this man that lieth here dead did so\nmuch by his wisdom and hardiness that the earl was taken, and three of\nhis lords, by force of this dead man.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Of a dead man, how men would have hewn him, and it would not\nbe, and how Sir Launcelot took the hair of the dead man.\n\n\nTHEN was there peace betwixt the earl and this Aguarus, and great surety\nthat the earl should never war against him. Then this dead man that here\nlieth came to this hermitage again; and then the earl made two of his\nnephews for to be avenged upon this man. So they came on a day, and\nfound this dead man at the sacring of his mass, and they abode him till\nhe had said mass. And then they set upon him and drew out swords to have\nslain him; but there would no sword bite on him more than upon a gad\nof steel, for the high Lord which he served He him preserved. Then made\nthey a great fire, and did off all his clothes, and the hair off his\nback. And then this dead man hermit said unto them: Ween you to burn me?\nIt shall not lie in your power nor to perish me as much as a thread, an\nthere were any on my body. No? said one of them, it shall be assayed.\nAnd then they despoiled him, and put upon him this shirt, and cast him\nin a fire, and there he lay all that night till it was day in that fire,\nand was not dead, and so in the morn I came and found him dead; but I\nfound neither thread nor skin tamed, and so took him out of the fire\nwith great fear, and laid him here as ye may see. And now may ye suffer\nme to go my way, for I have said you the sooth. And then he departed\nwith a great tempest.\n\nThen was the good man and Sir Launcelot more gladder than they were\nto-fore. And then Sir Launcelot dwelled with that good man that night.\nSir, said the good man, be ye not Sir Launcelot du Lake? Yea, sir, said\nhe. What seek ye in this country? Sir, said Sir Launcelot, I go to seek\nthe adventures of the Sangreal. Well, said he, seek it ye may well,\nbut though it were here ye shall have no power to see it no more than a\nblind man should see a bright sword, and that is long on your sin, and\nelse ye were more abler than any man living. And then Sir Launcelot\nbegan to weep. Then said the good man: Were ye confessed sith ye entered\ninto the quest of the Sangreal? Yea, sir, said Sir Launcelot. Then upon\nthe morn when the good man had sung his mass, then they buried the dead\nman. Then Sir Launcelot said: Father, what shall I do? Now, said the\ngood man, I require you take this hair that was this holy man's and put\nit next thy skin, and it shall prevail thee greatly. Sir, and I will do\nit, said Sir Launcelot. Also I charge you that ye eat no flesh as long\nas ye be in the quest of the Sangreal, nor ye shall drink no wine, and\nthat ye hear mass daily an ye may do it. So he took the hair and put it\nupon him, and so departed at evensong-time.\n\nAnd so rode he into a forest, and there he met with a gentlewoman riding\nupon a white palfrey, and then she asked him: Sir knight, whither ride\nye? Certes, damosel, said Launcelot, I wot not whither I ride but as\nfortune leadeth me. Ah, Sir Launcelot, said she, I wot what adventure ye\nseek, for ye were afore time nearer than ye be now, and yet shall ye see\nit more openly than ever ye did, and that shall ye understand in short\ntime. Then Sir Launcelot asked her where he might be harboured that\nnight. Ye shall not find this day nor night, but to-morn ye shall find\nharbour good, and ease of that ye be in doubt of And then he commended\nher unto God. Then he rode till that he came to a Cross, and took that\nfor his host as for that night.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. Of an advision that Sir Launcelot had, and how he told it\nto an hermit, and desired counsel of him.\n\n\nAND so he put his horse to pasture, and did off his helm and his shield,\nand made his prayers unto the Cross that he never fall in deadly sin\nagain. And so he laid him down to sleep. And anon as he was asleep it\nbefell him there an advision, that there came a man afore him all by\ncompass of stars, and that man had a crown of gold on his head and that\nman led in his fellowship seven kings and two knights. And all these\nworshipped the Cross, kneeling upon their knees, holding up their hands\ntoward the heaven. And all they said: Fair sweet Father of heaven come\nand visit us, and yield unto us everych as we have deserved.\n\nThen looked Launcelot up to the heaven, and him seemed the clouds did\nopen, and an old man came down, with a company of angels, and alighted\namong them, and gave unto everych his blessing, and called them his\nservants, and good and true knights. And when this old man had said thus\nhe came to one of those knights, and said: I have lost all that I have\nset in thee, for thou hast ruled thee against me as a warrior, and used\nwrong wars with vain-glory, more for the pleasure of the world than to\nplease me, therefore thou shalt be confounded without thou yield me my\ntreasure. All this advision saw Sir Launcelot at the Cross.\n\nAnd on the morn he took his horse and rode till mid-day; and there by\nadventure he met with the same knight that took his horse, helm, and his\nsword, when he slept when the Sangreal appeared afore the Cross. When\nSir Launcelot saw him he saluted him not fair, but cried on high:\nKnight, keep thee, for thou hast done to me great unkindness. And then\nthey put afore them their spears, and Sir Launcelot came so fiercely\nupon him that he smote him and his horse down to the earth, that he had\nnigh broken his neck. Then Sir Launcelot took the knight's horse that\nwas his own aforehand, and descended from the horse he sat upon, and\nmounted upon his own horse, and tied the knight's own horse to a\ntree, that he might find that horse when that he was arisen. Then Sir\nLauncelot rode till night, and by adventure he met an hermit, and each\nof them saluted other; and there he rested with that good man all night,\nand gave his horse such as he might get. Then said the good man unto\nLauncelot: Of whence be ye? Sir, said he, I am of Arthur's court, and my\nname is Sir Launcelot du Lake that am in the quest of the Sangreal, and\ntherefore I pray you to counsel me of a vision the which I had at the\nCross. And so he told him all.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. How the hermit expounded to Sir Launcelot his advision, and\ntold him that Sir Galahad was his son.\n\n\nLO, Sir Launcelot, said the good man, there thou mightest understand the\nhigh lineage that thou art come of, and thine advision betokeneth. After\nthe passion of Jesu Christ forty year, Joseph of Aramathie preached the\nvictory of King Evelake, that he had in the battles the better of his\nenemies. And of the seven kings and the two knights: the first of\nthem is called Nappus, an holy man; and the second hight Nacien, in\nremembrance of his grandsire, and in him dwelled our Lord Jesu Christ;\nand the third was called Helias le Grose; and the fourth hight Lisais;\nand the fifth hight Jonas, he departed out of his country and went into\nWales, and took there the daughter of Manuel, whereby he had the land\nof Gaul, and he came to dwell in this country. And of him came King\nLauncelot thy grandsire, the which there wedded the king's daughter of\nIreland, and he was as worthy a man as thou art, and of him came King\nBan, thy father, the which was the last of the seven kings. And by thee,\nSir Launcelot, it signifieth that the angels said thou were none of the\nseven fellowships. And the last was the ninth knight, he was signified\nto a lion, for he should pass all manner of earthly knights, that is Sir\nGalahad, the which thou gat on King Pelles' daughter; and thou ought to\nthank God more than any other man living, for of a sinner earthly thou\nhast no peer as in knighthood, nor never shall be. But little thank hast\nthou given to God for all the great virtues that God hath lent thee.\nSir, said Launcelot, ye say that that good knight is my son. That\noughtest thou to know and no man better, said the good man, for thou\nknewest the daughter of King Pelles fleshly, and on her thou begattest\nGalahad, and that was he that at the feast of Pentecost sat in the Siege\nPerilous; and therefore make thou it known openly that he is one of thy\nbegetting on King Pelles' daughter, for that will be your worship and\nhonour, and to all thy kindred. And I counsel you in no place press not\nupon him to have ado with him. Well, said Launcelot, meseemeth that good\nknight should pray for me unto the High Father, that I fall not to sin\nagain. Trust thou well, said the good man, thou farest mickle the better\nfor his prayer; but the son shall not bear the wickedness of the father,\nnor the father shall not bear the wickedness of the son, but everych\nshall bear his own burden. And therefore beseek thou only God, and He\nwill help thee in all thy needs. And then Sir Launcelot and he went to\nsupper, and so laid him to rest, and the hair pricked so Sir Launcelot's\nskin which grieved him full sore, but he took it meekly, and suffered\nthe pain. And so on the morn he heard his mass and took his arms, and so\ntook his leave.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. How Sir Launcelot jousted with many knights, and how he was\ntaken.\n\n\nAND then mounted upon his horse, and rode into a forest, and held no\nhighway. And as he looked afore him he saw a fair plain, and beside that\na fair castle, and afore the castle were many pavilions of silk and\nof diverse hue. And him seemed that he saw there five hundred knights\nriding on horseback; and there were two parties: they that were of the\ncastle were all on black horses and their trappings black, and they that\nwere without were all on white horses and trappings, and everych hurtled\nto other that it marvelled Sir Launcelot. And at the last him thought\nthey of the castle were put to the worse.\n\nThen thought Sir Launcelot for to help there the weaker party in\nincreasing of his chivalry. And so Sir Launcelot thrust in among the\nparty of the castle, and smote down a knight, horse and man, to the\nearth. And then he rashed here and there, and did marvellous deeds of\narms. And then he drew out his sword, and struck many knights to the\nearth, so that all those that saw him marvelled that ever one knight\nmight do so great deeds of arms. But always the white knights held them\nnigh about Sir Launcelot, for to tire him and wind him. But at the last,\nas a man may not ever endure, Sir Launcelot waxed so faint of fighting\nand travailing, and was so weary of his great deeds, that[1] he might\nnot lift up his arms for to give one stroke, so that he weened never to\nhave borne arms; and then they all took and led him away into a\nforest, and there made him to alight and to rest him. And then all the\nfellowship of the castle were overcome for the default of him. Then\nthey said all unto Sir Launcelot: Blessed be God that ye be now of our\nfellowship, for we shall hold you in our prison; and so they left\n\n\n[1] So W. de Worde; Caxton \"but.\"\n\n\nhim with few words. And then Sir Launcelot made great sorrow, For never\nor now was I never at tournament nor jousts but I had the best, and now\nI am shamed; and then he said: Now I am sure that I am more sinfuller\nthan ever I was.\n\nThus he rode sorrowing, and half a day he was out of despair, till that\nhe came into a deep valley. And when Sir Launcelot saw he might not ride\nup into the mountain, he there alighted under an apple tree, and there\nhe left his helm and his shield, and put his horse unto pasture. And\nthen he laid him down to sleep. And then him thought there came an old\nman afore him, the which said: Ah, Launcelot of evil faith and poor\nbelief, wherefore is thy will turned so lightly toward thy deadly sin?\nAnd when he had said thus he vanished away, and Launcelot wist not where\nhe was become. Then he took his horse, and armed him; and as he rode by\nthe way he saw a chapel where was a recluse, which had a window that she\nmight see up to the altar. And all aloud she called Launcelot, for that\nhe seemed a knight errant. And then he came, and she asked him what he\nwas, and of what place, and where about he went to seek.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. How Sir Launcelot told his advision to a woman, and how she\nexpounded it to him.\n\n\nAND then he told her altogether word by word, and the truth how it\nbefell him at the tournament. And after told her his advision that he\nhad had that night in his sleep, and prayed her to tell him what it\nmight mean, for he was not well content with it. Ah, Launcelot, said\nshe, as long as ye were knight of earthly knighthood ye were the most\nmarvellous man of the world, and most adventurous. Now, said the lady,\nsithen ye be set among the knights of heavenly adventures, if adventure\nfell thee contrary at that tournament have thou no marvel, for that\ntournament yesterday was but a tokening of Our Lord. And not for then\nthere was none enchantment, for they at the tournament were earthly\nknights. The tournament was a token to see who should have most knights,\neither Eliazar, the son of King Pelles, or Argustus, the son of King\nHarlon. But Eliazar was all clothed in white, and Argustus was covered\nin black, the which were [over]come.\n\nAll what this betokeneth I shall tell you. The day of Pentecost, when\nKing Arthur held his court, it befell that earthly kings and knights\ntook a tournament together, that is to say the quest of the Sangreal.\nThe earthly knights were they the which were clothed all in black, and\nthe covering betokeneth the sins whereof they be not confessed. And they\nwith the covering of white betokeneth virginity, and they that chose\nchastity. And thus was the quest begun in them. Then thou beheld the\nsinners and the good men, and when thou sawest the sinners overcome,\nthou inclinest to that party for bobaunce and pride of the world, and\nall that must be left in that quest, for in this quest thou shalt have\nmany fellows and thy betters. For thou art so feeble of evil trust and\ngood belief, this made it when thou were there where they took thee and\nled thee into the forest. And anon there appeared the Sangreal unto the\nwhite knights, but thou was so feeble of good belief and faith that thou\nmightest not abide it for all the teaching of the good man, but anon\nthou turnest to the sinners, and that caused thy misadventure that thou\nshould'st know good from evil and vain glory of the world, the which is\nnot worth a pear. And for great pride thou madest great sorrow that thou\nhadst not overcome all the white knights with the covering of white, by\nwhom was betokened virginity and chastity; and therefore God was wroth\nwith you, for God loveth no such deeds in this quest. And this advision\nsignifieth that thou were of evil faith and of poor belief, the which\nwill make thee to fall into the deep pit of hell if thou keep thee not.\nNow have I warned thee of thy vain glory and of thy pride, that thou\nhast many times erred against thy Maker. Beware of everlasting pain, for\nof all earthly knights I have most pity of thee, for I know well thou\nhast not thy peer of any earthly sinful man.\n\nAnd so she commended Sir Launcelot to dinner. And after dinner he took\nhis horse and commended her to God, and so rode into a deep valley, and\nthere he saw a river and an high mountain. And through the water he must\nneeds pass, the which was hideous; and then in the name of God he took\nit with good heart. And when he came over he saw an armed knight, horse\nand man black as any bear; without any word he smote Sir Launcelot's\nhorse to the earth; and so he passed on, he wist not where he was\nbecome. And then he took his helm and his shield, and thanked God of his\nadventure.\n\n_Here leadeth off the story of Sir Launcelot, and speak we of Sir\nGawaine, the which is the sixteenth book._\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XVI.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. How Sir Gawaine was nigh weary of the quest of the Sangreal,\nand of his marvellous dream.\n\n\nWHEN Sir Gawaine was departed from his fellowship he rode long without\nany adventure. For he found not the tenth part of adventure as he was\nwont to do. For Sir Gawaine rode from Whitsuntide until Michaelmas and\nfound none adventure that pleased him. So on a day it befell Gawaine met\nwith Sir Ector de Maris, and either made great joy of other that it\nwere marvel to tell. And so they told everych other, and complained them\ngreatly that they could find none adventure. Truly, said Sir Gawaine\nunto Sir Ector, I am nigh weary of this quest, and loath I am to follow\nfurther in strange countries. One thing marvelled me, said Sir Ector, I\nhave met with twenty knights, fellows of mine, and all they complain as\nI do. I have marvel, said Sir Gawaine, where that Sir Launcelot, your\nbrother, is. Truly, said Sir Ector, I cannot hear of him, nor of Sir\nGalahad, Percivale, nor Sir Bors. Let them be, said Sir Gawaine, for\nthey four have no peers. And if one thing were not in Sir Launcelot he\nhad no fellow of none earthly man; but he is as we be, but if he took\nmore pain upon him. But an these four be met together they will be loath\nthat any man meet with them; for an they fail of the Sangreal it is in\nwaste of all the remnant to recover it.\n\nThus Ector and Gawaine rode more than eight days, and on a Saturday\nthey found an old chapel, the which was wasted that there seemed no man\nthither repaired; and there they alighted, and set their spears at the\ndoor, and in they entered into the chapel, and there made their orisons\na great while, and set them down in the sieges of the chapel. And as\nthey spake of one thing and other, for heaviness they fell asleep, and\nthere befell them both marvellous adventures. Sir Gawaine him seemed he\ncame into a meadow full of herbs and flowers, and there he saw a rack\nof bulls, an hundred and fifty, that were proud and black, save three of\nthem were all white, and one had a black spot, and the other two were\nso fair and so white that they might be no whiter. And these three bulls\nwhich were so fair were tied with two strong cords. And the remnant of\nthe bulls said among them: Go we hence to seek better pasture. And so\nsome went, and some came again, but they were so lean that they might\nnot stand upright; and of the bulls that were so white, that one came\nagain and no mo. But when this white bull was come again among these\nother there rose up a great cry for lack of wind that failed them;\nand so they departed one here and another there: this advision befell\nGawaine that night.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Of the advision of Sir Ector, and how he jousted with Sir\nUwaine les Avoutres, his sworn brother.\n\n\nBUT to Ector de Maris befell another vision the contrary. For it seemed\nhim that his brother, Sir Launcelot, and he alighted out of a chair and\nleapt upon two horses, and the one said to the other: Go we seek that\nwe shall not find. And him thought that a man beat Sir Launcelot, and\ndespoiled him, and clothed him in another array, the which was all full\nof knots, and set him upon an ass, and so he rode till he came to the\nfairest well that ever he saw; and Sir Launcelot alighted and would have\ndrunk of that well. And when he stooped to drink of the water the water\nsank from him. And when Sir Launcelot saw that, he turned and went\nthither as the head came from. And in the meanwhile he trowed that\nhimself and Sir Ector rode till that they came to a rich man's house\nwhere there was a wedding. And there he saw a king the which said: Sir\nknight, here is no place for you. And then he turned again unto the\nchair that he came from.\n\nThus within a while both Gawaine and Ector awaked, and either told other\nof their advision, the which marvelled them greatly. Truly, said Ector,\nI shall never be merry till I hear tidings of my brother Launcelot. Now\nas they sat thus talking they saw an hand showing unto the elbow, and\nwas covered with red samite, and upon that hung a bridle not right rich,\nand held within the fist a great candle which burned right clear, and so\npassed afore them, and entered into the chapel, and then vanished away\nand they wist not where. And anon came down a voice which said: Knights\nof full evil faith and of poor belief, these two things have failed you,\nand therefore ye may not come to the adventures of the Sangreal.\n\nThen first spake Gawaine and said: Ector, have ye heard these words? Yea\ntruly, said Sir Ector, I heard all. Now go we, said Sir Ector, unto some\nhermit that will tell us of our advision, for it seemeth me we labour\nall in vain. And so they departed and rode into a valley, and there met\nwith a squire which rode on an hackney, and they saluted him fair. Sir,\nsaid Gawaine, can thou teach us to any hermit? Here is one in a\nlittle mountain, but it is so rough there may no horse go thither, and\ntherefore ye must go upon foot; there shall ye find a poor house, and\nthere is Nacien the hermit, which is the holiest man in this country.\nAnd so they departed either from other.\n\nAnd then in a valley they met with a knight all armed, which proffered\nthem to joust as far as he saw them. In the name of God, said Sir\nGawaine, sith I departed from Camelot there was none proffered me to\njoust but once. And now, sir, said Ector, let me joust with him. Nay,\nsaid Gawaine, ye shall not but if I be beat; it shall not for-think me\nthen if ye go after me. And then either embraced other to joust and came\ntogether as fast as their horses might run, and brast their shields and\nthe mails, and the one more than the other; and Gawaine was wounded in\nthe left side, but the other knight was smitten through the breast, and\nthe spear came out on the other side, and so they fell both out of their\nsaddles, and in the falling they brake both their spears.\n\nAnon Gawaine arose and set his hand to his sword, and cast his shield\nafore him. But all for naught was it, for the knight had no power to\narise against him. Then said Gawaine: Ye must yield you as an overcome\nman, or else I may slay you. Ah, sir knight, said he, I am but dead, for\nGod's sake and of your gentleness lead me here unto an abbey that I\nmay receive my Creator. Sir, said Gawaine, I know no house of religion\nhereby. Sir, said the knight, set me on an horse to-fore you, and I\nshall teach you. Gawaine set him up in the saddle, and he leapt up\nbehind him for to sustain him, and so came to an abbey where they were\nwell received; and anon he was unarmed, and received his Creator. Then\nhe prayed Gawaine to draw out the truncheon of the spear out of his\nbody. Then Gawaine asked him what he was, that knew him not. I am, said\nhe, of King Arthur's court, and was a fellow of the Round Table, and we\nwere brethren sworn together; and now Sir Gawaine, thou hast slain me,\nand my name is Uwaine les Avoutres, that sometime was son unto King\nUriens, and was in the quest of the Sangreal; and now forgive it thee\nGod, for it shall ever be said that the one sworn brother hath slain the\nother.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. How Sir Gawaine and Sir Ector came to an hermitage to be\nconfessed, and how they told to the hermit their advisions.\n\n\nALAS, said Gawaine, that ever this misadventure is befallen me.\nNo force, said Uwaine, sith I shall die this death, of a much more\nworshipfuller man's hand might I not die; but when ye come to the court\nrecommend me unto my lord, King Arthur, and all those that be left\nalive, and for old brotherhood think on me. Then began Gawaine to weep,\nand Ector also. And then Uwaine himself and Sir Gawaine drew out the\ntruncheon of the spear, and anon departed the soul from the body. Then\nSir Gawaine and Sir Ector buried him as men ought to bury a king's son,\nand made write upon his name, and by whom he was slain.\n\nThen departed Gawaine and Ector, as heavy as they might for their\nmisadventure, and so rode till that they came to the rough mountain, and\nthere they tied their horses and went on foot to the hermitage. And when\nthey were come up they saw a poor house, and beside the chapel a little\ncourtelage, where Nacien the hermit gathered worts, as he which had\ntasted none other meat of a great while. And when he saw the errant\nknights he came toward them and saluted them, and they him again. Fair\nlords, said he, what adventure brought you hither? Sir, said Gawaine,\nto speak with you for to be confessed. Sir, said the hermit, I am ready.\nThen they told him so much that he wist well what they were. And then he\nthought to counsel them if he might.\n\nThen began Gawaine first and told him of his advision that he had had in\nthe chapel, and Ector told him all as it is afore rehearsed. Sir, said\nthe hermit unto Sir Gawaine, the fair meadow and the rack therein\nought to be understood the Round Table, and by the meadow ought to be\nunderstood humility and patience, those be the things which be always\ngreen and quick; for men may no time overcome humility and patience,\ntherefore was the Round Table founded, and the chivalry hath been at\nall times so by the fraternity which was there that she might not be\novercome; for men said she was founded in patience and in humility. At\nthe rack ate an hundred and fifty bulls; but they ate not in the meadow,\nfor their hearts should be set in humility and patience, and the bulls\nwere proud and black save only three. By the bulls is to understand the\nfellowship of the Round Table, which for their sin and their wickedness\nbe black. Blackness is to say without good or virtuous works. And the\nthree bulls which were white save only one that was spotted: the two\nwhite betoken Sir Galahad and Sir Percivale, for they be maidens clean\nand without spot; and the third that had a spot signifieth Sir Bors de\nGanis, which trespassed but once in his virginity, but sithen he kept\nhimself so well in chastity that all is forgiven him and his misdeeds.\nAnd why those three were tied by the necks, they be three knights in\nvirginity and chastity, and there is no pride smitten in them. And the\nblack bulls which said: Go we hence, they were those which at Pentecost\nat the high feast took upon them to go in the quest of the Sangreal\nwithout confession: they might not enter in the meadow of humility\nand patience. And therefore they returned into waste countries, that\nsignifieth death, for there shall die many of them: everych of them\nshall slay other for sin, and they that shall escape shall be so lean\nthat it shall be marvel to see them. And of the three bulls without\nspot, the one shall come again, and the other two never.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. How the hermit expounded their advision.\n\n\nTHEN spake Nacien unto Ector: Sooth it is that Launcelot and ye came\ndown off one chair: the chair betokeneth mastership and lordship which\nye came down from. But ye two knights, said the hermit, ye go to seek\nthat ye shall never find, that is the Sangreal; for it is the secret\nthing of our Lord Jesu Christ. What is to mean that Sir Launcelot fell\ndown off his horse: he hath left pride and taken him to humility, for he\nhath cried mercy loud for his sin, and sore repented him, and our Lord\nhath clothed him in his clothing which is full of knots, that is the\nhair that he weareth daily. And the ass that he rode upon is a beast of\nhumility, for God would not ride upon no steed, nor upon no palfrey;\nso in ensample that an ass betokeneth meekness, that thou sawest Sir\nLauncelot ride on in thy sleep. And the well whereas the water sank from\nhim when he should have taken thereof, and when he saw he might not have\nit, he returned thither from whence he came, for the well betokeneth the\nhigh grace of God, the more men desire it to take it, the more shall be\ntheir desire. So when he came nigh the Sangreal, he meeked him that he\nheld him not a man worthy to be so nigh the Holy Vessel, for he had\nbeen so defouled in deadly sin by the space of many years; yet when\nhe kneeled to drink of the well, there he saw great providence of\nthe Sangreal. And for he had served so long the devil, he shall have\nvengeance four-and-twenty days long, for that he hath been the devil's\nservant four-and-twenty years. And then soon after he shall return unto\nCamelot out of this country, and he shall say a part of such things as\nhe hath found.\n\nNow will I tell you what betokeneth the hand with the candle and the\nbridle: that is to understand the Holy Ghost where charity is ever, and\nthe bridle signifieth abstinence. For when she is bridled in Christian\nman's heart she holdeth him so short that he falleth not in deadly sin.\nAnd the candle which sheweth clearness and sight signifieth the right\nway of Jesu Christ. And when he went and said: Knights of poor faith and\nof wicked belief, these three things failed, charity, abstinence, and\ntruth; therefore ye may not attain that high adventure of the Sangreal.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. Of the good counsel that the hermit gave to them.\n\n\nCERTES, said Gawaine, soothly have ye said, that I see it openly. Now, I\npray you, good man and holy father, tell me why we met not with so many\nadventures as we were wont to do, and commonly have the better. I shall\ntell you gladly, said the good man; the adventure of the Sangreal which\nye and many other have undertaken the quest of it and find it not, the\ncause is for it appeareth not to sinners. Wherefore marvel not though\nye fail thereof, and many other. For ye be an untrue knight and a great\nmurderer, and to good men signifieth other things than murder. For I\ndare say, as sinful as Sir Launcelot hath been, sith that he went into\nthe quest of the Sangreal he slew never man, nor nought shall, till that\nhe come unto Camelot again, for he hath taken upon him for to forsake\nsin. And nere that he nis not stable, but by his thought he is likely to\nturn again, he should be next to enchieve it save Galahad, his son. But\nGod knoweth his thought and his unstableness, and yet shall he die right\nan holy man, and no doubt he hath no fellow of no earthly sinful man.\nSir, said Gawaine, it seemeth me by your words that for our sins it will\nnot avail us to travel in this quest Truly, said the good man, there be\nan hundred such as ye be that never shall prevail, but to have shame.\nAnd when they had heard these voices they commended him unto God.\n\nThen the good man called Gawaine, and said: It is long time passed sith\nthat ye were made knight, and never sithen thou servedst thy Maker,\nand now thou art so old a tree that in thee is neither life nor fruit;\nwherefore bethink thee that thou yield to Our Lord the bare rind, sith\nthe fiend hath the leaves and the fruit. Sir, said Gawaine an I had\nleisure I would speak with you, but my fellow here, Sir Ector, is gone,\nand abideth me yonder beneath the hill. Well, said the good man, thou\nwere better to be counselled. Then departed Gawaine and came to Ector,\nand so took their horses and rode till they came to a forester's house,\nwhich harboured them right well. And on the morn they departed from\ntheir host, and rode long or they could find any adventure.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. How Sir Bors met with an hermit, and how he was confessed to\nhim, and of his penance enjoined to him.\n\n\nWHEN Bors was departed from Camelot he met with a religious man riding\non an ass, and Sir Bors saluted him. Anon the good man knew him that\nhe was one of the knights-errant that was in the quest of the Sangreal.\nWhat are ye? said the good man. Sir, said he, I am a knight that fain\nwould be counselled in the quest of the Sangreal, for he shall have much\nearthly worship that may bring it to an end. Certes, said the good man,\nthat is sooth, for he shall be the best knight of the world, and the\nfairest of all the fellowship. But wit you well there shall none attain\nit but by cleanness, that is pure confession.\n\nSo rode they together till that they came to an hermitage. And there he\nprayed Bors to dwell all that night with him. And so he alighted and put\naway his armour, and prayed him that he might be confessed; and so they\nwent into the chapel, and there he was clean confessed, and they ate\nbread and drank water together. Now, said the good man, I pray thee that\nthou eat none other till that thou sit at the table where the Sangreal\nshall be. Sir, said he, I agree me thereto, but how wit ye that I shall\nsit there. Yes, said the good man, that know I, but there shall be but\nfew of your fellows with you. All is welcome, said Sir Bors, that God\nsendeth me. Also, said the good man, instead of a shirt, and in sign of\nchastisement, ye shall wear a garment; therefore I pray you do off\nall your clothes and your shirt: and so he did. And then he took him\na scarlet coat, so that should be instead of his shirt till he had\nfulfilled the quest of the Sangreal; and the good man found in him so\nmarvellous a life and so stable, that he marvelled and felt that he was\nnever corrupt in fleshly lusts, but in one time that he begat Elian le\nBlank.\n\nThen he armed him, and took his leave, and so departed. And so a little\nfrom thence he looked up into a tree, and there he saw a passing great\nbird upon an old tree, and it was passing dry, without leaves; and the\nbird sat above, and had birds, the which were dead for hunger. So smote\nhe himself with his beak, the which was great and sharp. And so the\ngreat bird bled till that he died among his birds. And the young birds\ntook the life by the blood of the great bird. When Bors saw this he wist\nwell it was a great tokening; for when he saw the great bird arose not,\nthen he took his horse and yede his way. So by evensong, by adventure he\ncame to a strong tower and an high, and there was he lodged gladly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. How Sir Bors was lodged with a lady, and how he took upon\nhim for to fight against a champion for her land.\n\n\nAND when he was unarmed they led him into an high tower where was a\nlady, young, lusty, and fair. And she received him with great joy, and\nmade him to sit down by her, and so was he set to sup with flesh and\nmany dainties. And when Sir Bors saw that, he bethought him on his\npenance, and bade a squire to bring him water. And so he brought him,\nand he made sops therein and ate them. Ah, said the lady, I trow ye like\nnot my meat. Yes, truly, said Sir Bors, God thank you, madam, but I may\neat none other meat this day. Then she spake no more as at that time,\nfor she was loath to displease him. Then after supper they spake of one\nthing and other.\n\nWith that came a squire and said: Madam, ye must purvey you to-morn for\na champion, for else your sister will have this castle and also your\nlands, except ye can find a knight that will fight to-morn in your\nquarrel against Pridam le Noire. Then she made sorrow and said: Ah,\nLord God, wherefore granted ye to hold my land, whereof I should now be\ndisherited without reason and right? And when Sir Bors had heard her\nsay thus, he said: I shall comfort you. Sir, said she, I shall tell you\nthere was here a king that hight Aniause, which held all this land in\nhis keeping. So it mishapped he loved a gentlewoman a great deal elder\nthan I. So took he her all this land to her keeping, and all his men to\ngovern; and she brought up many evil customs whereby she put to death a\ngreat part of his kinsmen. And when he saw that, he let chase her out of\nthis land, and betook it me, and all this land in my demesnes. But anon\nas that worthy king was dead, this other lady began to war upon me, and\nhath destroyed many of my men, and turned them against me, that I have\nwell-nigh no man left me; and I have nought else but this high tower\nthat she left me. And yet she hath promised me to have this tower,\nwithout I can find a knight to fight with her champion.\n\nNow tell me, said Sir Bors, what is that Pridam le Noire? Sir, said she,\nhe is the most doubted man of this land. Now may ye send her word that\nye have found a knight that shall fight with that Pridam le Noire in\nGod's quarrel and yours. Then that lady was not a little glad, and sent\nword that she was purveyed, and that night Bors had good cheer; but\nin no bed he would come, but laid him on the floor, nor never would do\notherwise till that he had met with the quest of the Sangreal.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. Of an advision which Sir Bors had that night, and how he\nfought and overcame his adversary.\n\n\nAND anon as he was asleep him befell a vision, that there came to him\ntwo birds, the one as white as a swan, and the other was marvellous\nblack; but it was not so great as the other, but in the likeness of a\nRaven. Then the white bird came to him, and said: An thou wouldst give\nme meat and serve me I should give thee all the riches of the world,\nand I shall make thee as fair and as white as I am. So the white bird\ndeparted, and there came the black bird to him, and said: An thou wolt,\nserve me to-morrow and have me in no despite though I be black, for wit\nthou well that more availeth my blackness than the other's whiteness.\nAnd then he departed.\n\nAnd he had another vision: him thought that he came to a great place\nwhich seemed a chapel, and there he found a chair set on the left side,\nwhich was worm-eaten and feeble. And on the right hand were two flowers\nlike a lily, and the one would have benome the other's whiteness, but a\ngood man departed them that the one touched not the other; and then out\nof every flower came out many flowers, and fruit great plenty. Then him\nthought the good man said: Should not he do great folly that would let\nthese two flowers perish for to succour the rotten tree, that it fell\nnot to the earth? Sir, said he, it seemeth me that this wood might\nnot avail. Now keep thee, said the good man, that thou never see such\nadventure befall thee.\n\nThen he awaked and made a sign of the cross in midst of the forehead,\nand so rose and clothed him. And there came the lady of the place, and\nshe saluted him, and he her again, and so went to a chapel and heard\ntheir service. And there came a company of knights, that the lady had\nsent for, to lead Sir Bors unto battle. Then asked he his arms. And when\nhe was armed she prayed him to take a little morsel to dine. Nay, madam,\nsaid he, that shall I not do till I have done my battle, by the grace of\nGod. And so he leapt upon his horse, and departed, all the knights and\nmen with him. And as soon as these two ladies met together, she which\nBors should fight for complained her, and said: Madam, ye have done\nme wrong to bereave me of my lands that King Aniause gave me, and full\nloath I am there should be any battle. Ye shall not choose, said the\nother lady, or else your knight withdraw him.\n\nThen there was the cry made, which party had the better of the two\nknights, that his lady should rejoice all the land. Now departed the one\nknight here, and the other there. Then they came together with such\na raundon that they pierced their shields and their hauberks, and the\nspears flew in pieces, and they wounded either other sore. Then hurtled\nthey together, so that they fell both to the earth, and their horses\nbetwixt their legs; and anon they arose, and set hands to their swords,\nand smote each one other upon the heads, that they made great wounds and\ndeep, that the blood went out of their bodies. For there found Sir Bors\ngreater defence in that knight more than he weened. For that Pridam was\na passing good knight, and he wounded Sir Bors full evil, and he him\nagain; but ever this Pridam held the stour in like hard. That perceived\nSir Bors, and suffered him till he was nigh attaint. And then he ran\nupon him more and more, and the other went back for dread of death.\nSo in his withdrawing he fell upright, and Sir Bors drew his helm so\nstrongly that he rent it from his head, and gave him great strokes with\nthe flat of his sword upon the visage, and bade him yield him or he\nshould slay him. Then he cried him mercy and said: Fair knight, for\nGod's love slay me not, and I shall ensure thee never to war against thy\nlady, but be alway toward her. Then Bors let him be; then the old lady\nfled with all her knights.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. How the lady was returned to her lands by the battle of Sir\nBors, and of his departing, and how he met Sir Lionel taken and beaten\nwith thorns, and also of a maid which should have been devoured.\n\n\nSO then came Bors to all those that held lands of his lady, and said he\nshould destroy them but if they did such service unto her as longed\nto their lands. So they did their homage, and they that would not were\nchased out of their lands. Then befell that young lady to come to her\nestate again, by the mighty prowess of Sir Bors de Ganis. So when all\nthe country was well set in peace, then Sir Bors took his leave and\ndeparted; and she thanked him greatly, and would have given him great\nriches, but he refused it.\n\nThen he rode all that day till night, and came to an harbour to a lady\nwhich knew him well enough, and made of him great Joy. Upon the morn, as\nsoon as the day appeared, Bors departed from thence, and so rode into\na forest unto the hour of midday, and there befell him a marvellous\nadventure. So he met at the departing of the two ways two knights that\nled Lionel, his brother, all naked, bounden upon a strong hackney, and\nhis hands bounden to-fore his breast. And everych of them held in his\nhands thorns wherewith they went beating him so sore that the blood\ntrailed down more than in an hundred places of his body, so that he was\nall blood to-fore and behind, but he said never a word; as he which was\ngreat of heart he suffered all that ever they did to him, as though he\nhad felt none anguish.\n\nAnon Sir Bors dressed him to rescue him that was his brother; and so he\nlooked upon the other side of him, and saw a knight which brought a fair\ngentlewoman, and would have set her in the thickest place of the forest\nfor to have been the more surer out of the way from them that sought\nhim. And she which was nothing assured cried with an high voice: Saint\nMary succour your maid. And anon she espied where Sir Bors came riding.\nAnd when she came nigh him she deemed him a knight of the Round Table,\nwhereof she hoped to have some comfort; and then she conjured him: By\nthe faith that he ought unto Him in whose service thou art entered in,\nand for the faith ye owe unto the high order of knighthood, and for the\nnoble King Arthur's sake, that I suppose made thee knight, that thou\nhelp me, and suffer me not to be shamed of this knight. When Bors heard\nher say thus he had so much sorrow there he nist not what to do. For if\nI let my brother be in adventure he must be slain, and that would I not\nfor all the earth. And if I help not the maid she is shamed for ever,\nand also she shall lose her virginity the which she shall never get\nagain. Then lift he up his eyes and said weeping: Fair sweet Lord\nJesu Christ, whose liege man I am, keep Lionel, my brother, that these\nknights slay him not, and for pity of you, and for Mary's sake, I shall\nsuccour this maid.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. How Sir Bors left to rescue his brother, and rescued the\ndamosel; and how it was told him that Lionel was dead.\n\n\nTHEN dressed he him unto the knight the which had the gentlewoman, and\nthen he cried: Sir knight, let your hand off that maiden, or ye be but\ndead. And then he set down the maiden, and was armed at all pieces save\nhe lacked his spear. Then he dressed his shield, and drew out his sword,\nand Bors smote him so hard that it went through his shield and habergeon\non the left shoulder. And through great strength he beat him down to the\nearth, and at the pulling out of Bors' spear there he swooned. Then\ncame Bors to the maid and said: How seemeth it you? of this knight ye\nbe delivered at this time. Now sir, said she, I pray you lead me thereas\nthis knight had me. So shall I do gladly: and took the horse of the\nwounded knight, and set the gentlewoman upon him, and so brought her as\nshe desired. Sir knight, said she, ye have better sped than ye weened,\nfor an I had lost my maidenhead, five hundred men should have died for\nit. What knight was he that had you in the forest? By my faith, said\nshe, he is my cousin. So wot I never with what engine the fiend enchafed\nhim, for yesterday he took me from my father privily; for I, nor none of\nmy father's men, mistrusted him not, and if he had had my maidenhead he\nshould have died for the sin, and his body shamed and dishonoured for\never. Thus as she stood talking with him there came twelve knights\nseeking after her, and anon she told them all how Bors had delivered\nher; then they made great joy, and besought him to come to her father,\na great lord, and he should be right welcome. Truly, said Bors, that may\nnot be at this time, for I have a great adventure to do in this country.\nSo he commended them unto God and departed.\n\nThen Sir Bors rode after Lionel, his brother, by the trace of their\nhorses, thus he rode seeking a great while. Then he overtook a man\nclothed in a religious clothing; and rode on a strong black horse\nblacker than a berry, and said: Sir knight, what seek you? Sir, said he,\nI seek my brother that I saw within a while beaten with two knights. Ah,\nBors, discomfort you not, nor fall into no wanhope; for I shall tell you\ntidings such as they be, for truly he is dead. Then showed he him a new\nslain body lying in a bush, and it seemed him well that it was the body\nof Lionel, and then he made such a sorrow that he fell to the earth all\nin a swoon, and lay a great while there. And when he came to himself he\nsaid: Fair brother, sith the company of you and me is departed shall\nI never have joy in my heart, and now He which I have taken unto my\nmaster, He be my help. And when he had said thus he took his body\nlightly in his arms, and put it upon the arson of his saddle. And then\nhe said to the man: Canst thou tell me unto some chapel where that I may\nbury this body? Come on, said he, here is one fast by; and so long they\nrode till they saw a fair tower, and afore it there seemed an old feeble\nchapel. And then they alighted both, and put him into a tomb of marble.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. How Sir Bors told his dream to a priest, which he had\ndreamed, and of the counsel that the priest gave to him.\n\n\nNOW leave we him here, said the good man, and go we to our harbour till\nto-morrow; we will come here again to do him service. Sir, said Bors, be\nye a priest? Yea forsooth, said he. Then I pray you tell me a dream that\nbefell to me the last night. Say on, said he. Then he began so much\nto tell him of the great bird in the forest, and after told him of his\nbirds, one white, another black, and of the rotten tree, and of the\nwhite flowers. Sir, I shall tell you a part now, and the other deal\nto-morrow. The white fowl betokeneth a gentlewoman, fair and rich, which\nloved thee paramours, and hath loved thee long; and if thou warn her\nlove she shall go die anon, if thou have no pity on her. That signifieth\nthe great bird, the which shall make thee to warn her. Now for no fear\nthat thou hast, ne for no dread that thou hast of God, thou shalt not\nwarn her, but thou wouldst not do it for to be holden chaste, for to\nconquer the loos of the vain glory of the world; for that shall befall\nthee now an thou warn her, that Launcelot, the good knight, thy cousin,\nshall die. And therefore men shall now say that thou art a manslayer,\nboth of thy brother, Sir Lionel, and of thy cousin, Sir Launcelot du\nLake, the which thou mightest have saved and rescued easily, but thou\nweenedst to rescue a maid which pertaineth nothing to thee. Now look\nthou whether it had been greater harm of thy brother's death, or else to\nhave suffered her to have lost her maidenhood. Then asked he him: Hast\nthou heard the tokens of thy dream the which I have told to you? Yea\nforsooth, said Sir Bors, all your exposition and declaring of my dream\nI have well understood and heard. Then said the man in this black\nclothing: Then is it in thy default if Sir Launcelot, thy cousin, die.\nSir, said Bors, that were me loath, for wit ye well there is nothing in\nthe world but I had liefer do it than to see my lord, Sir Launcelot du\nLake, to die in my default. Choose ye now the one or the other, said the\ngood man.\n\nAnd then he led Sir Bors into an high tower, and there he found knights\nand ladies: those ladies said he was welcome, and so they unarmed him.\nAnd when he was in his doublet men brought him a mantle furred with\nermine, and put it about him; and then they made him such cheer that\nhe had forgotten all his sorrow and anguish, and only set his heart in\nthese delights and dainties, and took no thought more for his brother,\nSir Lionel, neither of Sir Launcelot du Lake, his cousin. And anon came\nout of a chamber to him the fairest lady than ever he saw, and more\nricher beseen than ever he saw Queen Guenever or any other estate. Lo,\nsaid they, Sir Bors, here is the lady unto whom we owe all our service,\nand I trow she be the richest lady and the fairest of all the world, and\nthe which loveth you best above all other knights, for she will have no\nknight but you. And when he understood that language he was abashed. Not\nfor then she saluted him, and he her; and then they sat down together\nand spake of many things, in so much that she besought him to be her\nlove, for she had loved him above all earthly men, and she should make\nhim richer than ever was man of his age. When Bors understood her words\nhe was right evil at ease, which in no manner would not break chastity,\nso wist not he how to answer her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. How the devil in a woman's likeness would have had Sir Bors\nto have lain by her, and how by God's grace he escaped.\n\n\nALAS, said she, Bors, shall ye not do my will? Madam, said Bors, there\nis no lady in the world whose will I will fulfil as of this thing, for\nmy brother lieth dead which was slain right late. Ah Bors, said she,\nI have loved you long for the great beauty I have seen in you, and the\ngreat hardiness that I have heard of you, that needs ye must lie by\nme this night, and therefore I pray you grant it me. Truly, said he,\nI shall not do it in no manner wise. Then she made him such sorrow\nas though she would have died. Well Bors, said she, unto this have ye\nbrought me, nigh to mine end. And therewith she took him by the hand,\nand bade him behold her. And ye shall see how I shall die for your love.\nAh, said then he, that shall I never see.\n\nThen she departed and went up into an high battlement, and led with her\ntwelve gentlewomen; and when they were above, one of the gentlewomen\ncried, and said: Ah, Sir Bors, gentle knight have mercy on us all, and\nsuffer my lady to have her will, and if ye do not we must suffer death\nwith our lady, for to fall down off this high tower, and if ye suffer us\nthus to die for so little a thing all ladies and gentlewomen will say\nor you dishonour. Then looked he upward, they seemed all ladies of great\nestate, and richly and well beseen. Then had he of them great pity; not\nfor that he was uncounselled in himself that liefer he had they all had\nlost their souls than he his, and with that they fell adown all at\nonce unto the earth. And when he saw that, he was all abashed, and had\nthereof great marvel. With that he blessed his body and his visage. And\nanon he heard a great noise and a great cry, as though all the fiends of\nhell had been about him; and therewith he saw neither tower, nor lady,\nnor gentlewoman, nor no chapel where he brought his brother to. Then\nheld he up both his hands to the heaven, and said: Fair Father God, I am\ngrievously escaped; and then he took his arms and his horse and rode on\nhis way.\n\nThen he heard a clock smite on his right hand; and thither he came to an\nabbey on his right hand, closed with high walls, and there was let in.\nThen they supposed that he was one of the quest of the Sangreal, so they\nled him into a chamber and unarmed him. Sirs, said Sir Bors, if there be\nany holy man in this house I pray you let me speak with him. Then one\nof them led him unto the Abbot, which was in a chapel. And then Sir Bors\nsaluted him, and he him again. Sir, said Bors, I am a knight-errant;\nand told him all the adventure which he had seen. Sir Knight, said the\nAbbot, I wot not what ye be, for I weened never that a knight of your\nage might have been so strong in the grace of our Lord Jesu Christ. Not\nfor then ye shall go unto your rest, for I will not counsel you this\nday, it is too late, and to-morrow I shall counsel you as I can.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. Of the holy communication of an Abbot to Sir Bors, and how\nthe Abbot counselled him.\n\n\nAND that night was Sir Bors served richly; and on the morn early he\nheard mass, and the Abbot came to him, and bade him good morrow, and\nBors to him again. And then he told him he was a fellow of the quest\nof the Sangreal, and how he had charge of the holy man to eat bread and\nwater. Then [said the Abbot]: Our Lord Jesu Christ showed him unto you\nin the likeness of a soul that suffered great anguish for us, since He\nwas put upon the cross, and bled His heart-blood for mankind: there was\nthe token and the likeness of the Sangreal that appeared afore you, for\nthe blood that the great fowl bled revived the chickens from death to\nlife. And by the bare tree is betokened the world which is naked and\nwithout fruit but if it come of Our Lord. Also the lady for whom ye\nfought for, and King Aniause which was lord there-to-fore, betokeneth\nJesu Christ which is the King of the world. And that ye fought with the\nchampion for the lady, this it betokeneth: for when ye took the battle\nfor the lady, by her shall ye understand the new law of Jesu Christ and\nHoly Church; and by the other lady ye shall understand the old law and\nthe fiend, which all day warreth against Holy Church, therefore ye did\nyour battle with right. For ye be Jesu Christ's knights, therefore ye\nought to be defenders of Holy Church. And by the black bird might ye\nunderstand Holy Church, which sayeth I am black, but he is fair. And by\nthe white bird might men understand the fiend, and I shall tell you how\nthe swan is white without-forth, and black within: it is hypocrisy which\nis without yellow or pale, and seemeth without-forth the servants\nof Jesu Christ, but they be within so horrible of filth and sin, and\nbeguile the world evil. Also when the fiend appeared to thee in likeness\nof a man of religion, and blamed thee that thou left thy brother for a\nlady, so led thee where thou seemed thy brother was slain, but he is yet\nalive; and all was for to put thee in error, and bring thee unto wanhope\nand lechery, for he knew thou were tender hearted, and all was for thou\nshouldst not find the blessed adventure of the Sangreal. And the third\nfowl betokeneth the strong battle against the fair ladies which were all\ndevils. Also the dry tree and the white lily: the dry tree betokeneth\nthy brother Lionel, which is dry without virtue, and therefore many men\nought to call him the rotten tree, and the worm-eaten tree, for he is a\nmurderer and doth contrary to the order of knighthood. And the two white\nflowers signify two maidens, the one is a knight which was wounded the\nother day, and the other is the gentlewoman which ye rescued; and why\nthe other flower drew nigh the other, that was the knight which would\nhave defouled her and himself both. And Sir Bors, ye had been a great\nfool and in great peril for to have seen those two flowers perish for to\nsuccour the rotten tree, for an they had sinned together they had been\ndamned; and for that ye rescued them both, men might call you a very\nknight and servant of Jesu Christ.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. How Sir Bors met with his brother Sir Lionel, and how Sir\nLionel would have slain Sir Bors.\n\n\nTHEN went Sir Bors from thence and commended the Abbot unto God. And\nthen he rode all that day, and harboured with an old lady. And on the\nmorn he rode to a castle in a valley, and there he met with a yeoman\ngoing a great pace toward a forest. Say me, said Sir Bors, canst thou\ntell me of any adventure? Sir, said he, here shall be under this castle\na great and a marvellous tournament. Of what folks shall it be? said\nSir Bors. The Earl of Plains shall be in the one party, and the lady's\nnephew of Hervin on the other party. Then Bors thought to be there if he\nmight meet with his brother Sir Lionel, or any other of his fellowship,\nwhich were in the quest of the Sangreal. And then he turned to an\nhermitage that was in the entry of the forest.\n\nAnd when he was come thither he found there Sir Lionel, his brother,\nwhich sat all armed at the entry of the chapel door for to abide there\nharbour till on the morn that the tournament shall be. And when Sir Bors\nsaw him he had great joy of him, that it were marvel to tell of his joy.\nAnd then he alighted off his horse, and said: Fair sweet brother, when\ncame ye hither? Anon as Lionel saw him he said: Ah Bors, ye may not make\nnone avaunt, but as for you I might have been slain; when ye saw\ntwo knights leading me away beating me, ye left me for to succour a\ngentlewoman, and suffered me in peril of death; for never erst ne did\nno brother to another so great an untruth. And for that misdeed now I\nensure you but death, for well have ye deserved it; therefore keep thee\nfrom henceforward, and that shall ye find as soon as I am armed. When\nSir Bors understood his brother's wrath he kneeled down to the earth and\ncried him mercy, holding up both his hands, and prayed him to forgive\nhim his evil will. Nay, said Lionel, that shall never be an I may have\nthe higher hand, that I make mine avow to God, thou shalt have death for\nit, for it were pity ye lived any longer.\n\nRight so he went in and took his harness, and mounted upon his horse,\nand came to-fore him and said: Bors, keep thee from me, for I shall\ndo to thee as I would to a felon or a traitor, for ye be the untruest\nknight that ever came out of so worthy an house as was King Bors de\nGanis which was our father, therefore start upon thy horse, and so shall\nye be most at your advantage. And but if ye will I will run upon you\nthereas ye stand upon foot, and so the shame shall be mine and the harm\nyours, but of that shame ne reck I nought.\n\nWhen Sir Bors saw that he must fight with his brother or else to die, he\nnist what to do; then his heart counselled him not thereto, inasmuch\nas Lionel was born or he, wherefore he ought to bear him reverence;\nyet kneeled he down afore Lionel's horse's feet, and said: Fair sweet\nbrother, have mercy upon me and slay me not, and have in remembrance\nthe great love which ought to be between us twain. What Sir Bors said to\nLionel he rought not, for the fiend had brought him in such a will that\nhe should slay him. Then when Lionel saw he would none other, and that\nhe would not have risen to give him battle, he rashed over him so that\nhe smote Bors with his horse, feet upward, to the earth, and hurt him so\nsore that he swooned of distress, the which he felt in himself to have\ndied without confession. So when Lionel saw this, he alighted off his\nhorse to have smitten off his head. And so he took him by the helm, and\nwould have rent it from his head. Then came the hermit running unto him,\nwhich was a good man and of great age, and well had heard all the words\nthat were between them, and so fell down upon Sir Bors.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. How Sir Colgrevance fought against Sir Lionel for to save\nSir Bors, and how the hermit was slain.\n\n\nTHEN he said to Lionel: Ah gentle knight, have mercy upon me and on thy\nbrother, for if thou slay him thou shalt be dead of sin, and that were\nsorrowful, for he is one of the worthiest knights of the world, and of\nthe best conditions. So God help me, said Lionel, sir priest, but if ye\nflee from him I shall slay you, and he shall never the sooner be quit.\nCertes, said the good man, I have liefer ye slay me than him, for my\ndeath shall not be great harm, not half so much as of his. Well, said\nLionel, I am greed; and set his hand to his sword and smote him so hard\nthat his head yede backward. Not for that he restrained him of his evil\nwill, but took his brother by the helm, and unlaced it to have stricken\noff his head, and had slain him without fail. But so it happed,\nColgrevance a fellow of the Round Table, came at that time thither as\nOur Lord's will was. And when he saw the good man slain he marvelled\nmuch what it might be. And then he beheld Lionel would have slain his\nbrother, and knew Sir Bors which he loved right well. Then stert he down\nand took Lionel by the shoulders, and drew him strongly aback from Bors,\nand said: Lionel, will ye slay your brother, the worthiest knight of the\nworld one? and that should no good man suffer. Why, said Lionel, will ye\nlet me? therefore if ye entermete you in this I shall slay you, and him\nafter. Why, said Colgrevance, is this sooth that ye will slay him? Slay\nhim will I, said he, whoso say the contrary, for he hath done so much\nagainst me that he hath well deserved it. And so ran upon him, and would\nhave smitten him through the head, and Sir Colgrevance ran betwixt them,\nand said: An ye be so hardy to do so more, we two shall meddle together.\n\nWhen Lionel understood his words he took his shield afore him, and asked\nhim what that he was. And he told him, Colgrevance, one of his fellows.\nThen Lionel defied him, and gave him a great stroke through the helm.\nThen he drew his sword, for he was a passing good knight, and defended\nhim right manfully. So long dured the battle that Bors rose up all\nanguishly, and beheld [how] Colgrevance, the good knight, fought with\nhis brother for his quarrel; then was he full sorry and heavy, and\nthought if Colgrevance slew him that was his brother he should never\nhave joy; and if his brother slew Colgrevance the shame should ever be\nmine. Then would he have risen to have departed them, but he had not so\nmuch might to stand on foot; so he abode him so long till Colgrevance\nhad the worse, for Lionel was of great chivalry and right hardy, for he\nhad pierced the hauberk and the helm, that he abode but death, for\nhe had lost much of his blood that it was marvel that he might stand\nupright. Then beheld he Sir Bors which sat dressing him upward and said:\nAh, Bors, why come ye not to cast me out of peril of death, wherein I\nhave put me to succour you which were right now nigh the death? Certes,\nsaid Lionel, that shall not avail you, for none of you shall bear others\nwarrant, but that ye shall die both of my hand. When Bors heard that,\nhe did so much, he rose and put on his helm. Then perceived he first\nthe hermit-priest which was slain, then made he a marvellous sorrow upon\nhim.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. How Sir Lionel slew Sir Colgrevance, and how after he would\nhave slain Sir Bors.\n\n\nTHEN oft Colgrevance cried upon Sir Bors: Why will ye let me die here\nfor your sake? if it please you that I die for you the death, it will\nplease me the better for to save a worthy man. With that word Sir Lionel\nsmote off the helm from his head. Then Colgrevance saw that he might not\nescape; then he said: Fair sweet Jesu, that I have misdone have mercy\nupon my soul, for such sorrow that my heart suffereth for goodness, and\nfor alms deed that I would have done here, be to me aligement of penance\nunto my soul's health. At these words Lionel smote him so sore that\nhe bare him to the earth. So he had slain Colgrevance he ran upon his\nbrother as a fiendly man, and gave him such a stroke that he made him\nstoop. And he that was full of humility prayed him for God's love to\nleave this battle: For an it befell, fair brother, that I slew you or\nye me, we should be dead of that sin. Never God me help but if I have on\nyou mercy, an I may have the better hand. Then drew Bors his sword,\nall weeping, and said: Fair brother, God knoweth mine intent. Ah, fair\nbrother, ye have done full evil this day to slay such an holy priest the\nwhich never trespassed. Also ye have slain a gentle knight, and one of\nour fellows. And well wot ye that I am not afeard of you greatly, but I\ndread the wrath of God, and this is an unkindly war, therefore God show\nmiracle upon us both. Now God have mercy upon me though I defend my\nlife against my brother: with that Bors lift up his hand and would have\nsmitten his brother.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. How there came a voice which charged Sir Bors to touch him\nnot, and of a cloud that came between them.\n\n\nAND then he heard a voice that said: Flee Bors, and touch him not, or\nelse thou shalt slay him. Right so alighted a cloud betwixt them in\nlikeness of a fire and a marvellous flame, that both their two shields\nbrent. Then were they sore afraid, that they fell both to the earth, and\nlay there a great while in a swoon. And when they came to themself, Bors\nsaw that his brother had no harm; then he held up both his hands, for he\ndread God had taken vengeance upon him. With that he heard a voice say:\nBors, go hence, and bear thy brother no longer fellowship, but take thy\nway anon right to the sea, for Sir Percivale abideth thee there. Then he\nsaid to his brother: Fair sweet brother, forgive me for God's love all\nthat I have trespassed unto you. Then he answered: God forgive it thee\nand I do gladly.\n\nSo Sir Bors departed from him and rode the next way to the sea. And at\nthe last by fortune he came to an abbey which was nigh the sea. That\nnight Bors rested him there; and in his sleep there came a voice to\nhim and bade him go to the sea. Then he stert up and made a sign of the\ncross in the midst of his forehead, and took his harness, and made ready\nhis horse, and mounted upon him; and at a broken wall he rode out, and\nrode so long till that he came to the sea. And on the strand he found a\nship covered all with white samite, and he alighted, and betook him to\nJesu Christ. And as soon as he entered into the ship, the ship departed\ninto the sea, and went so fast that him seemed the ship went flying, but\nit was soon dark so that he might know no man, and so he slept till it\nwas day. Then he awaked, and saw in midst of the ship a knight lie all\narmed save his helm. Then knew he that it was Sir Percivale of Wales,\nand then he made of him right great joy; but Sir Percivale was abashed\nof him, and he asked him what he was. Ah, fair sir, said Bors, know ye\nme not? Certes, said he, I marvel how ye came hither, but if Our Lord\nbrought ye hither Himself. Then Sir Bors smiled and did off his helm.\nThen Percivale knew him, and either made great joy of other, that it\nwas marvel to hear. Then Bors told him how he came into the ship, and\nby whose admonishment; and either told other of their temptations, as\nye have heard to-forehand. So went they downward in the sea, one while\nbackward, another while forward, and everych comforted other, and oft\nwere in their prayers. Then said Sir Percivale: We lack nothing but\nGalahad, the good knight.\n\n_And thus endeth the sixteenth book, which is of Sir Gawaine, Ector de\nMaris, and Sir Bors de Ganis, and Sir Percivale. And here followeth the\nseven-teenth book, which is of the noble knight Sir Galahad._\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XVII.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. How Sir Galahad fought at a tournament, and how he was known\nof Sir Gawaine and Sir Ector de Maris.\n\n\nNOW saith this story, when Galahad had rescued Percivale from the twenty\nknights, he yede tho into a waste forest wherein he rode many journeys;\nand he found many adventures the which he brought to an end, whereof the\nstory maketh here no mention. Then he took his way to the sea on a day,\nand it befell as he passed by a castle where was a wonder tournament,\nbut they without had done so much that they within were put to the\nworse, yet were they within good knights enough. When Galahad saw that\nthose within were at so great a mischief that men slew them at the entry\nof the castle, then he thought to help them, and put a spear forth\nand smote the first that he fell to the earth, and the spear brake to\npieces. Then he drew his sword and smote thereas they were thickest,\nand so he did wonderful deeds of arms that all they marvelled. Then\nit happed that Gawaine and Sir Ector de Maris were with the knights\nwithout. But when they espied the white shield with the red cross the\none said to the other: Yonder is the good knight, Sir Galahad, the haut\nprince: now he should be a great fool which should meet with him to\nfight. So by adventure he came by Sir Gawaine, and he smote him so\nhard that he clave his helm and the coif of iron unto his head, so that\nGawaine fell to the earth; but the stroke was so great that it slanted\ndown to the earth and carved the horse's shoulder in two.\n\nWhen Ector saw Gawaine down he drew him aside, and thought it no wisdom\nfor to abide him, and also for natural love, that he was his uncle. Thus\nthrough his great hardiness he beat aback all the knights without. And\nthen they within came out and chased them all about. But when Galahad\nsaw there would none turn again he stole away privily, so that none wist\nwhere he was become. Now by my head, said Gawaine to Ector, now are the\nwonders true that were said of Launcelot du Lake, that the sword which\nstuck in the stone should give me such a buffet that I would not have\nit for the best castle in this world; and soothly now it is proved\ntrue, for never ere had I such a stroke of man's hand. Sir, said Ector,\nmeseemeth your quest is done. And yours is not done, said Gawaine, but\nmine is done, I shall seek no further. Then Gawaine was borne into a\ncastle and unarmed him, and laid him in a rich bed, and a leech found\nthat he might live, and to be whole within a month. Thus Gawaine and\nEctor abode together, for Sir Ector would not away till Gawaine were\nwhole.\n\nAnd the good knight, Galahad, rode so long till he came that night to\nthe Castle of Carboneck; and it befell him thus that he was benighted\nin an hermitage. So the good man was fain when he saw he was a\nknight-errant. Tho when they were at rest there came a gentlewoman\nknocking at the door, and called Galahad, and so the good man came to\nthe door to wit what she would. Then she called the hermit: Sir Ulfin,\nI am a gentlewoman that would speak with the knight which is with you.\nThen the good man awaked Galahad, and bade him: Arise, and speak with\na gentlewoman that seemeth hath great need of you. Then Galahad went to\nher and asked her what she would. Galahad, said she, I will that ye\narm you, and mount upon your horse and follow me, for I shall show you\nwithin these three days the highest adventure that ever any knight saw.\nAnon Galahad armed him, and took his horse, and commended him to God,\nand bade the gentlewoman go, and he would follow thereas she liked.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. How Sir Galahad rode with a damosel, and came to the ship\nwhereas Sir Bors and Sir Percivale were in.\n\n\nSO she rode as fast as her palfrey might bear her, till that she came to\nthe sea, the which was called Collibe. And at the night they came unto\na castle in a valley, closed with a running water, and with strong walls\nand high; and so she entered into the castle with Galahad, and there had\nhe great cheer, for the lady of that castle was the damosel's lady. So\nwhen he was unarmed, then said the damosel: Madam, shall we abide here\nall this day? Nay, said she, but till he hath dined and till he hath\nslept a little. So he ate and slept a while till that the maid called\nhim, and armed him by torchlight. And when the maid was horsed and he\nboth, the lady took Galahad a fair child and rich; and so they departed\nfrom the castle till they came to the seaside; and there they found the\nship where Bors and Percivale were in, the which cried on the ship's\nboard: Sir Galahad, ye be welcome, we have abiden you long. And when he\nheard them he asked them what they were. Sir, said she, leave your horse\nhere, and I shall leave mine; and took their saddles and their bridles\nwith them, and made a cross on them, and so entered into the ship. And\nthe two knights received them both with great joy, and everych knew\nother; and so the wind arose, and drove them through the sea in a\nmarvellous pace. And within a while it dawned.\n\nThen did Galahad off his helm and his sword, and asked of his fellows\nfrom whence came that fair ship. Truly, said they, ye wot as well as\nwe, but of God's grace; and then they told everych to other of all their\nhard adventures, and of their great temptations. Truly, said Galahad, ye\nare much bounden to God, for ye have escaped great adventures; and had\nnot the gentlewoman been I had not come here, for as for you I weened\nnever to have found you in these strange countries. Ah Galahad, said\nBors, if Launcelot, your father, were here then were we well at ease,\nfor then meseemed we failed nothing. That may not be, said Galahad, but\nif it pleased Our Lord.\n\nBy then the ship went from the land of Logris, and by adventure it\narrived up betwixt two rocks passing great and marvellous; but there\nthey might not land, for there was a swallow of the sea, save there was\nanother ship, and upon it they might go without danger. Go we thither,\nsaid the gentlewoman, and there shall we see adventures, for so is Our\nLord's will. And when they came thither they found the ship rich enough,\nbut they found neither man nor woman therein. But they found in the end\nof the ship two fair letters written, which said a dreadful word and a\nmarvellous: Thou man, which shall enter into this ship, beware thou\nbe in steadfast belief, for I am Faith, and therefore beware how\nthou enterest, for an thou fail I shall not help thee. Then said the\ngentlewoman: Percivale, wot ye what I am? Certes, said he, nay, to my\nwitting. Wit ye well, said she, that I am thy sister, which am daughter\nof King Pellinore, and therefore wit ye well ye are the man in the world\nthat I most love; and if ye be not in perfect belief of Jesu Christ\nenter not in no manner of wise, for then should ye perish the ship,\nfor he is so perfect he will suffer no sinner in him. When Percivale\nunderstood that she was his very sister he was inwardly glad, and said:\nFair sister, I shall enter therein, for if I be a miscreature or an\nuntrue knight there shall I perish.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. How Sir Galahad entered into the ship, and of a fair bed\ntherein, with other marvellous things, and of a sword.\n\n\nIN the meanwhile Galahad blessed him, and entered therein; and then next\nthe gentlewoman, and then Sir Bors and Sir Percivale. And when they were\nin, it was so marvellous fair and rich that they marvelled; and in midst\nof the ship was a fair bed, and Galahad went thereto, and found there\na crown of silk. And at the feet was a sword, rich and fair, and it\nwas drawn out of the sheath half a foot and more; and the sword was of\ndivers fashions, and the pommel was of stone, and there was in him all\nmanner of colours that any man might find, and everych of the colours\nhad divers virtues; and the scales of the haft were of two ribs of\ndivers beasts, the one beast was a serpent which was conversant in\nCalidone, and is called the Serpent of the fiend; and the bone of him is\nof such a virtue that there is no hand that handleth him shall never be\nweary nor hurt. And the other beast is a fish which is not right great,\nand haunteth the flood of Euphrates; and that fish is called Ertanax,\nand his bones be of such a manner of kind that who that handleth them\nshall have so much will that he shall never be weary, and he shall not\nthink on joy nor sorrow that he hath had but only that thing that he\nbeholdeth before him. And as for this sword there shall never man begrip\nhim at the handles but one; but he shall pass all other. In the name of\nGod, said Percivale, I shall assay to handle it. So he set his hand to\nthe sword, but he might not begrip it. By my faith, said he, now have I\nfailed. Bors set his hand thereto and failed.\n\nThen Galahad beheld the sword and saw letters like blood that said:\nLet see who shall assay to draw me out of my sheath, but if he be more\nhardier than any other; and who that draweth me, wit ye well that he\nshall never fail of shame of his body, or to be wounded to the death. By\nmy faith, said Galahad, I would draw this sword out of the sheath, but\nthe offending is so great that I shall not set my hand thereto. Now\nsirs, said the gentlewoman, wit ye well that the drawing of this sword\nis warned to all men save all only to you. Also this ship arrived in the\nrealm of Logris; and that time was deadly war between King Labor, which\nwas father unto the maimed king, and King Hurlame, which was a Saracen.\nBut then was he newly christened, so that men held him afterward one\nof the wittiest men of the world. And so upon a day it befell that King\nLabor and King Hurlame had assembled their folk upon the sea where this\nship was arrived; and there King Hurlame was discomfit, and his men\nslain; and he was afeard to be dead, and fled to his ship, and there\nfound this sword and drew it, and came out and found King Labor, the man\nin the world of all Christendom in whom was then the greatest faith. And\nwhen King Hurlame saw King Labor he dressed this sword, and smote him\nupon the helm so hard that he clave him and his horse to the earth with\nthe first stroke of his sword. And it was in the realm of Logris; and\nso befell great pestilence and great harm to both realms. For sithen\nincreased neither corn, nor grass, nor well-nigh no fruit, nor in the\nwater was no fish; wherefore men call it the lands of the two marches,\nthe waste land, for that dolorous stroke. And when King Hurlame saw this\nsword so carving, he turned again to fetch the scabbard, and so came\ninto this ship and entered, and put up the sword in the sheath. And as\nsoon as he had done it he fell down dead afore the bed. Thus was the\nsword proved, that none ne drew it but he were dead or maimed. So lay he\nthere till a maiden came into the ship and cast him out, for there was\nno man so hardy of the world to enter into that ship for the defence.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. Of the marvels of the sword and of the scabbard.\n\n\nAND then beheld they the scabbard, it seemed to be of a serpent's skin,\nand thereon were letters of gold and silver. And the girdle was but\npoorly to come to, and not able to sustain such a rich sword. And the\nletters said: He which shall wield me sought to be more harder than any\nother, if he bear me as truly as me ought to be borne. For the body of\nhim which I ought to hang by, he shall not be shamed in no place while\nhe is girt with this girdle, nor never none be so hardy to do away this\ngirdle; for it ought not be done away but by the hands of a maid, and\nthat she be a king's daughter and queen's, and she must be a maid all\nthe days of her life, both in will and in deed. And if she break her\nvirginity she shall die the most villainous death that ever died any\nwoman. Sir, said Percivale, turn this sword that we may see what is on\nthe other side. And it was red as blood, with black letters as any coal,\nwhich said: He that shall praise me most, most shall he find me to blame\nat a great need; and to whom I should be most debonair shall I be most\nfelon, and that shall be at one time.\n\nFair brother, said she to Percivale, it befell after a forty year after\nthe passion of Jesu Christ that Nacien, the brother-in-law of King\nMordrains, was borne into a town more than fourteen days' journey from\nhis country, by the commandment of Our Lord, into an isle, into the\nparts of the West, that men cleped the Isle of Turnance. So befell it\nthat he found this ship at the entry of a rock, and he found the bed\nand this sword as we have heard now. Not for then he had not so much\nhardiness to draw it; and there he dwelled an eight days, and at the\nninth day there fell a great wind which departed him out of the isle,\nand brought him to another isle by a rock, and there he found the\ngreatest giant that ever man might see. Therewith came that horrible\ngiant to slay him; and then he looked about him and might not flee, and\nhe had nothing to defend him with. So he ran to his sword, and when he\nsaw it naked he praised it much, and then he shook it, and therewith he\nbrake it in the midst. Ah, said Nacien, the thing that I most praised\nought I now most to blame, and therewith he threw the pieces of his\nsword over his bed. And after he leapt over the board to fight with the\ngiant, and slew him.\n\nAnd anon he entered into the ship again, and the wind arose, and drove\nhim through the sea, that by adventure he came to another ship where\nKing Mordrains was, which had been tempted full evil with a fiend in the\nPort of Perilous Rock. And when that one saw the other they made great\njoy of other, and either told other of their adventure, and how the\nsword failed him at his most need When Mordrains saw the sword he\npraised it much: But the breaking was not to do but by wickedness of thy\nselfward, for thou art in some sin. And there he took the sword, and\nset the pieces together, and they soldered as fair as ever they were\nto-fore; and there put he the sword in the sheath, and laid it down on\nthe bed. Then heard they a voice that said: Go out of this ship a little\nwhile, and enter into the other, for dread ye fall in deadly sin, for\nand ye be found in deadly sin ye may not escape but perish: and so\nthey went into the other ship. And as Nacien went over the board he was\nsmitten with a sword on the right foot, that he fell down noseling to\nthe ship's board; and therewith he said: O God, how am I hurt. And then\nthere came a voice and said: Take thou that for thy forfeit that thou\ndidst in drawing of this sword, therefore thou receivest a wound, for\nthou were never worthy to handle it, as the writing maketh mention. In\nthe name of God, said Galahad, ye are right wise of these works.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. How King Pelles was smitten through both thighs because he\ndrew the sword, and other marvellous histories.\n\n\nSIR, said she, there was a king that hight Pelles, the maimed king. And\nwhile he might ride he supported much Christendom and Holy Church. So\nupon a day he hunted in a wood of his which lasted unto the sea; and at\nthe last he lost his hounds and his knights save only one: and there\nhe and his knight went till that they came toward Ireland, and there he\nfound the ship. And when he saw the letters and understood them, yet he\nentered, for he was right perfect of his life, but his knight had none\nhardiness to enter; and there found he this sword, and drew it out\nas much as ye may see. So therewith entered a spear wherewith he was\nsmitten him through both the thighs, and never sith might he be healed,\nnor nought shall to-fore we come to him. Thus, said she, was not King\nPelles, your grandsire, maimed for his hardiness? In the name of God,\ndamosel, said Galahad.\n\nSo they went toward the bed to behold all about it, and above the head\nthere hung two swords. Also there were two spindles which were as white\nas any snow, and other that were as red as blood, and other above green\nas any emerald: of these three colours were the spindles, and of natural\ncolour within, and without any painting. These spindles, said the\ndamosel, were when sinful Eve came to gather fruit, for which Adam and\nshe were put out of paradise, she took with her the bough on which the\napple hung on. Then perceived she that the branch was fair and green,\nand she remembered her the loss which came from the tree. Then she\nthought to keep the branch as long as she might. And for she had no\ncoffer to keep it in, she put it in the earth. So by the will of Our\nLord the branch grew to a great tree within a little while, and was\nas white as any snow, branches, boughs, and leaves: that was a token\na maiden planted it. But after God came to Adam, and bade him know his\nwife fleshly as nature required. So lay Adam with his wife under the\nsame tree; and anon the tree which was white was full green as any\ngrass, and all that came out of it; and in the same time that they\nmedled together there was Abel begotten: thus was the tree long of green\ncolour. And so it befell many days after, under the same tree Caym slew\nAbel, whereof befell great marvel. For anon as Abel had received the\ndeath under the green tree, it lost the green colour and became red; and\nthat was in tokening of the blood. And anon all the plants died thereof,\nbut the tree grew and waxed marvellously fair, and it was the fairest\ntree and the most delectable that any man might behold and see; and so\ndied the plants that grew out of it to-fore that Abel was slain under\nit. So long dured the tree till that Solomon, King David's son, reigned,\nand held the land after his father. This Solomon was wise and knew all\nthe virtues of stones and trees, and so he knew the course of the\nstars, and many other divers things. This Solomon had an evil wife,\nwherethrough he weened that there had been no good woman, and so he\ndespised them in his books. So answered a voice him once: Solomon, if\nheaviness come to a man by a woman, ne reck thou never; for yet shall\nthere come a woman whereof there shall come greater joy to man an\nhundred times more than this heaviness giveth sorrow; and that woman\nshall be born of thy lineage. Tho when Solomon heard these words he held\nhimself but a fool, and the truth he perceived by old books. Also the\nHoly Ghost showed him the coming of the glorious Virgin Mary. Then asked\nhe of the voice, if it should be in the yerde of his lineage. Nay, said\nthe voice, but there shall come a man which shall be a maid, and the\nlast of your blood, and he shall be as good a knight as Duke Josua, thy\nbrother-in-law.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. How Solomon took David's sword by the counsel of his wife,\nand of other matters marvellous.\n\n\nNOW have I certified thee of that thou stoodest in doubt. Then was\nSolomon glad that there should come any such of his lineage; but ever\nhe marvelled and studied who that should be, and what his name might\nbe. His wife perceived that he studied, and thought she would know it at\nsome season; and so she waited her time, and asked of him the cause of\nhis studying, and there he told her altogether how the voice told\nhim. Well, said she, I shall let make a ship of the best wood and most\ndurable that men may find. So Solomon sent for all the carpenters of\nthe land, and the best. And when they had made the ship the lady said\nto Solomon: Sir, said she, since it is so that this knight ought to pass\nall knights of chivalry which have been to-fore him and shall come after\nhim, moreover I shall tell you, said she, ye shall go into Our Lord's\ntemple, where is King David's sword, your father, the which is the\nmarvelloust and the sharpest that ever was taken in any knight's hand.\nTherefore take that, and take off the pommel, and thereto make ye\na pommel of precious stones, that it be so subtly made that no man\nperceive it but that they be all one; and after make there an hilt so\nmarvellously and wonderly that no man may know it; and after make a\nmarvellous sheath. And when ye have made all this I shall let make a\ngirdle thereto, such as shall please me.\n\nAll this King Solomon did let make as she devised, both the ship and all\nthe remnant. And when the ship was ready in the sea to sail, the lady\nlet make a great bed and marvellous rich, and set her upon the bed's\nhead, covered with silk, and laid the sword at the feet, and the girdles\nwere of hemp, and therewith the king was angry. Sir, wit ye well, said\nshe, that I have none so high a thing which were worthy to sustain so\nhigh a sword, and a maid shall bring other knights thereto, but I wot\nnot when it shall be, nor what time. And there she let make a covering\nto the ship, of cloth of silk that should never rot for no manner of\nweather. Yet went that lady and made a carpenter to come to the tree\nwhich Abel was slain under. Now, said she, carve me out of this tree as\nmuch wood as will make me a spindle. Ah madam, said he, this is the tree\nthe which our first mother planted. Do it, said she, or else I shall\ndestroy thee. Anon as he began to work there came out drops of blood;\nand then would he have left, but she would not suffer him, and so he\ntook away as much wood as might make a spindle: and so she made him to\ntake as much of the green tree and of the white tree. And when these\nthree spindles were shapen she made them to be fastened upon the selar\nof the bed. When Solomon saw this, he said to his wife: Ye have done\nmarvellously, for though all the world were here right now, he could not\ndevise wherefore all this was made, but Our Lord Himself; and thou that\nhast done it wottest not what it shall betoken. Now let it be, said\nshe, for ye shall hear tidings sooner than ye ween. Now shall ye hear a\nwonderful tale of King Solomon and his wife.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. A wonderful tale of King Solomon and his wife.\n\n\nTHAT night lay Solomon before the ship with little fellowship. And when\nhe was asleep him thought there came from heaven a great company of\nangels, and alighted into the ship, and took water which was brought by\nan angel, in a vessel of silver, and sprent all the ship. And after he\ncame to the sword, and drew letters on the hilt. And after went to the\nship's board, and wrote there other letters which said: Thou man that\nwilt enter within me, beware that thou be full within the faith, for\nI ne am but Faith and Belief. When Solomon espied these letters he was\nabashed, so that he durst not enter, and so drew him aback; and the ship\nwas anon shoven in the sea, and he went so fast that he lost sight of\nhim within a little while. And then a little voice said: Solomon, the\nlast knight of thy lineage shall rest in this bed. Then went Solomon and\nawaked his wife, and told her of the adventures of the ship.\n\nNow saith the history that a great while the three fellows beheld the\nbed and the three spindles. Then they were at certain that they were of\nnatural colours without painting. Then they lift up a cloth which was\nabove the ground, and there found a rich purse by seeming. And Percivale\ntook it, and found therein a writ and so he read it, and devised the\nmanner of the spindles and of the ship, whence it came, and by whom it\nwas made. Now, said Galahad, where shall we find the gentlewoman that\nshall make new girdles to the sword? Fair sir, said Percivale's sister,\ndismay you not, for by the leave of God I shall let make a girdle to the\nsword, such one as shall long thereto. And then she opened a box, and\ntook out girdles which were seemly wrought with golden threads, and\nupon that were set full precious stones, and a rich buckle of gold. Lo,\nlords, said she, here is a girdle that ought to be set about the sword.\nAnd wit ye well the greatest part of this girdle was made of my hair,\nwhich I loved well while that I was a woman of the world. But as soon\nas I wist that this adventure was ordained me I clipped off my hair, and\nmade this girdle in the name of God. Ye be well found, said Sir Bors,\nfor certes ye have put us out of great pain, wherein we should have\nentered ne had your tidings been.\n\nThen went the gentlewoman and set it on the girdle of the sword. Now,\nsaid the fellowship, what is the name of the sword, and what shall we\ncall it? Truly, said she, the name of the sword is the Sword with the\nStrange Girdles; and the sheath, Mover of Blood; for no man that hath\nblood in him ne shall never see the one part of the sheath which was\nmade of the Tree of Life. Then they said to Galahad: In the name of Jesu\nChrist, and pray you that ye gird you with this sword which hath been\ndesired so much in the realm of Logris. Now let me begin, said Galahad,\nto grip this sword for to give you courage; but wit ye well it longeth\nno more to me than it doth to you. And then he gripped about it with his\nfingers a great deal; and then she girt him about the middle with the\nsword. Now reck I not though I die, for now I hold me one of the blessed\nmaidens of the world, which hath made the worthiest knight of the world.\nDamosel, said Galahad, ye have done so much that I shall be your knight\nall the days of my life.\n\nThen they went from that ship, and went to the other. And anon the wind\ndrove them into the sea a great pace, but they had no victuals: but it\nbefell that they came on the morn to a castle that men call Carteloise,\nthat was in the marches of Scotland. And when they had passed the port,\nthe gentlewoman said: Lords, here be men arriven that, an they wist that\nye were of King Arthur's court, ye should be assailed anon. Damosel,\nsaid Galahad, He that cast us out of the rock shall deliver us from\nthem.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. How Galahad and his fellows came to a castle, and how\nthey were fought withal, and how they slew their adversaries, and other\nmatters.\n\n\nSO it befell as they spoke thus there came a squire by them, and asked\nwhat they were; and they said they were of King Arthur's house. Is that\nsooth? said he. Now by my head, said he, ye be ill arrayed; and then\nturned he again unto the cliff fortress. And within a while they heard\nan horn blow. Then a gentlewoman came to them, and asked them of whence\nthey were; and they told her. Fair lords, said she, for God's love turn\nagain if ye may, for ye be come unto your death. Nay, they said, we will\nnot turn again, for He shall help us in whose service we be entered in.\nThen as they stood talking there came knights well armed, and bade them\nyield them or else to die. That yielding, said they, shall be noyous to\nyou. And therewith they let their horses run, and Sir Percivale smote\nthe foremost to the earth, and took his horse, and mounted thereupon,\nand the same did Galahad. Also Bors served another so, for they had no\nhorses in that country, for they left their horses when they took their\nship in other countries. And so when they were horsed then began they to\nset upon them; and they of the castle fled into the strong fortress, and\nthe three knights after them into the castle, and so alighted on foot,\nand with their swords slew them down, and gat into the hall.\n\nThen when they beheld the great multitude of people that they had slain,\nthey held themself great sinners. Certes, said Bors, I ween an God had\nloved them that we should not have had power to have slain them thus.\nBut they have done so much against Our Lord that He would not suffer\nthem to reign no longer. Say ye not so, said Galahad, for if they misdid\nagainst God, the vengeance is not ours, but to Him which hath power\nthereof.\n\nSo came there out of a chamber a good man which was a priest, and bare\nGod's body in a cup. And when he saw them which lay dead in the hall he\nwas all abashed; and Galahad did off his helm and kneeled down, and so\ndid his two fellows. Sir, said they, have ye no dread of us, for we be\nof King Arthur's court. Then asked the good man how they were slain so\nsuddenly, and they told it him. Truly, said the good man, an ye might\nlive as long as the world might endure, ne might ye have done so great\nan alms-deed as this. Sir, said Galahad, I repent me much, inasmuch as\nthey were christened. Nay, repent you not, said he, for they were not\nchristened, and I shall tell you how that I wot of this castle. Here was\nLord Earl Hernox not but one year, and he had three sons, good knights\nof arms, and a daughter, the fairest gentlewoman that men knew. So those\nthree knights loved their sister so sore that they brent in love, and so\nthey lay by her, maugre her head. And for she cried to her father they\nslew her, and took their father and put him in prison, and wounded him\nnigh to the death, but a cousin of hers rescued him. And then did they\ngreat untruth: they slew clerks and priests, and made beat down chapels,\nthat Our Lord's service might not be served nor said. And this same day\nher father sent to me for to be confessed and houseled; but such shame\nhad never man as I had this day with the three brethren, but the earl\nbade me suffer, for he said they should not long endure, for three\nservants of Our Lord should destroy them, and now it is brought to an\nend. And by this may ye wit that Our Lord is not displeased with your\ndeeds. Certes, said Galahad, an it had not pleased Our Lord, never\nshould we have slain so many men in so little a while.\n\nAnd then they brought the Earl Hernox out of prison into the midst of\nthe hall, that knew Galahad anon, and yet he saw him never afore but by\nrevelation of Our Lord.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. How the three knights, with Percivale's sister, came unto\nthe same forest, and of an hart and four lions, and other things.\n\n\n\nTHEN began he to weep right tenderly, and said: Long have I abiden your\ncoming, but for God's love hold me in your arms, that my soul may depart\nout of my body in so good a man's arms as ye be. Gladly, said Galahad.\nAnd then one said on high, that all heard: Galahad, well hast thou\navenged me on God's enemies. Now behoveth thee to go to the Maimed King\nas soon as thou mayest, for he shall receive by thee health which he\nhath abiden so long. And therewith the soul departed from the body, and\nGalahad made him to be buried as him ought to be.\n\nRight so departed the three knights, and Percivale's sister with them.\nAnd so they came into a waste forest, and there they saw afore them a\nwhite hart which four lions led. Then they took them to assent for to\nfollow after for to know whither they repaired; and so they rode after a\ngreat pace till that they came to a valley, and thereby was an hermitage\nwhere a good man dwelled, and the hart and the lions entered also. So\nwhen they saw all this they turned to the chapel, and saw the good man\nin a religious weed and in the armour of Our Lord, for he would sing\nmass of the Holy Ghost; and so they entered in and heard mass. And at\nthe secrets of the mass they three saw the hart become a man, the which\nmarvelled them, and set him upon the altar in a rich siege; and saw the\nfour lions were changed, the one to the form of a man, the other to the\nform of a lion, and the third to an eagle, and the fourth was changed\nunto an ox. Then took they their siege where the hart sat, and went out\nthrough a glass window, and there was nothing perished nor broken; and\nthey heard a voice say: In such a manner entered the Son of God in the\nwomb of a maid Mary, whose virginity ne was perished ne hurt. And when\nthey heard these words they fell down to the earth and were astonied;\nand therewith was a great clearness.\n\nAnd when they were come to theirself again they went to the good man and\nprayed him that he would say them truth. What thing have ye seen? said\nhe. And they told him all that they had seen. Ah lords, said he, ye be\nwelcome; now wot I well ye be the good knights the which shall bring the\nSangreal to an end; for ye be they unto whom Our Lord shall shew great\nsecrets. And well ought Our Lord be signified to an hart, for the hart\nwhen he is old he waxeth young again in his white skin. Right so cometh\nagain Our Lord from death to life, for He lost earthly flesh that was\nthe deadly flesh, which He had taken in the womb of the blessed Virgin\nMary; and for that cause appeared Our Lord as a white hart without spot.\nAnd the four that were with Him is to understand the four evangelists\nwhich set in writing a part of Jesu Christ's deeds that He did sometime\nwhen He was among you an earthly man; for wit ye well never erst ne\nmight no knight know the truth, for ofttimes or this Our Lord showed\nHim unto good men and unto good knights, in likeness of an hart, but I\nsuppose from henceforth ye shall see no more. And then they joyed much,\nand dwelled there all that day. And upon the morrow when they had heard\nmass they departed and commended the good man to God: and so they came\nto a castle and passed by. So there came a knight armed after them and\nsaid: Lords, hark what I shall say to you.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. How they were desired of a strange custom, the which they\nwould not obey; wherefore they fought and slew many knights.\n\n\nTHIS gentlewoman that ye lead with you is a maid? Sir, said she, a maid\nI am. Then he took her by the bridle and said: By the Holy Cross, ye\nshall not escape me to-fore ye have yolden the custom of this castle.\nLet her go, said Percivale, ye be not wise, for a maid in what place\nshe cometh is free. So in the meanwhile there came out a ten or twelve\nknights armed, out of the castle, and with them came gentlewomen which\nheld a dish of silver. And then they said: This gentlewoman must yield\nus the custom of this castle. Sir, said a knight, what maid passeth\nhereby shall give this dish full of blood of her right arm. Blame have\nye, said Galahad, that brought up such customs, and so God me save, I\nensure you of this gentlewoman ye shall fail while that I live. So God\nme help, said Percivale, I had liefer be slain. And I also, said Sir\nBors. By my troth, said the knight, then shall ye die, for ye may not\nendure against us though ye were the best knights of the world.\n\nThen let they run each to other, and the three fellows beat the ten\nknights, and then set their hands to their swords and beat them down\nand slew them. Then there came out of the castle a three score knights\narmed. Fair lords, said the three fellows, have mercy on yourself and\nhave not ado with us. Nay, fair lords, said the knights of the castle,\nwe counsel you to withdraw you, for ye be the best knights of the world,\nand therefore do no more, for ye have done enough. We will let you go\nwith this harm, but we must needs have the custom. Certes, said Galahad,\nfor nought speak ye. Well, said they, will ye die? We be not yet come\nthereto, said Galahad. Then began they to meddle together, and Galahad,\nwith the strange girdles, drew his sword, and smote on the right hand\nand on the left hand, and slew what that ever abode him, and did such\nmarvels that there was none that saw him but weened he had been none\nearthly man, but a monster. And his two fellows halp him passing well,\nand so they held the journey everych in like hard till it was night:\nthen must they needs depart.\n\nSo came in a good knight, and said to the three fellows: If ye will come\nin to-night and take such harbour as here is ye shall be right welcome,\nand we shall ensure you by the faith of our bodies, and as we be true\nknights, to leave you in such estate to-morrow as we find you, without\nany falsehood. And as soon as ye know of the custom we dare say ye will\naccord therefore. For God's love, said the gentlewoman, go thither and\nspare not for me. Go we, said Galahad; and so they entered into the\nchapel. And when they were alighted they made great joy of them. So\nwithin a while the three knights asked the custom of the castle and\nwherefore it was. What it is, said they, we will say you sooth.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. How Sir Percivale's sister bled a dish full of blood for\nto heal a lady, wherefore she died; and how that the body was put in a\nship.\n\n\nTHERE is in this castle a gentlewoman which we and this castle is hers,\nand many other. So it befell many years agone there fell upon her a\nmalady; and when she had lain a great while she fell unto a measle, and\nof no leech she could have no remedy. But at the last an old man said an\nshe might have a dish full of blood of a maid and a clean virgin in will\nand in work, and a king's daughter, that blood should be her health, and\nfor to anoint her withal; and for this thing was this custom made. Now,\nsaid Percivale's sister, fair knights, I see well that this gentlewoman\nis but dead. Certes, said Galahad, an ye bleed so much ye may die.\nTruly, said she, an I die for to heal her I shall get me great worship\nand soul's health, and worship to my lineage, and better is one harm\nthan twain. And therefore there shall be no more battle, but to-morn I\nshall yield you your custom of this castle. And then there was great joy\nmore than there was to-fore, for else had there been mortal war upon the\nmorn; notwithstanding she would none other, whether they wold or nold.\n\nThat night were the three fellows eased with the best; and on the morn\nthey heard mass, and Sir Percivale's sister bade bring forth the sick\nlady. So she was, the which was evil at ease. Then said she: Who shall\nlet me blood? So one came forth and let her blood, and she bled so much\nthat the dish was full. Then she lift up her hand and blessed her; and\nthen she said to the lady: Madam, I am come to the death for to make you\nwhole, for God's love pray for me. With that she fell in a swoon.\nThen Galahad and his two fellows start up to her, and lift her up and\nstaunched her, but she had bled so much that she might not live. Then\nshe said when she was awaked: Fair brother Percivale, I die for the\nhealing of this lady, so I require you that ye bury me not in this\ncountry, but as soon as I am dead put me in a boat at the next haven,\nand let me go as adventure will lead me; and as soon as ye three come to\nthe City of Sarras, there to enchieve the Holy Grail, ye shall find me\nunder a tower arrived, and there bury me in the spiritual place; for I\nsay you so much, there Galahad shall be buried, and ye also, in the same\nplace.\n\nThen Percivale understood these words, and granted it her, weeping. And\nthen said a voice: Lords and fellows, to-morrow at the hour of prime ye\nthree shall depart everych from other, till the adventure bring you\nto the Maimed King. Then asked she her Saviour; and as soon as she had\nreceived it the soul departed from the body. So the same day was the\nlady healed, when she was anointed withal. Then Sir Percivale made a\nletter of all that she had holpen them as in strange adventures, and put\nit in her right hand, and so laid her in a barge, and covered it with\nblack silk; and so the wind arose, and drove the barge from the land,\nand all knights beheld it till it was out of their sight. Then they drew\nall to the castle, and so forthwith there fell a sudden tempest and a\nthunder, lightning, and rain, as all the earth would have broken. So\nhalf the castle turned up-so-down. So it passed evensong or the tempest\nwas ceased.\n\nThen they saw afore them a knight armed and wounded hard in the body and\nin the head, that said: O God, succour me for now it is need. After this\nknight came another knight and a dwarf, which cried to them afar: Stand,\nye may not escape. Then the wounded knight held up his hands to God\nthat he should not die in such tribulation. Truly, said Galahad, I shall\nsuccour him for His sake that he calleth upon. Sir, said Bors, I shall\ndo it, for it is not for you, for he is but one knight. Sir, said he,\nI grant. So Sir Bors took his horse, and commended him to God, and rode\nafter, to rescue the wounded knight. Now turn we to the two fellows.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. How Galahad and Percivale found in a castle many tombs of\nmaidens that had bled to death.\n\n\nNOW saith the story that all night Galahad and Percivale were in a\nchapel in their prayers, for to save Sir Bors. So on the morrow they\ndressed them in their harness toward the castle, to wit what was fallen\nof them therein. And when they came there they found neither man nor\nwoman that he ne was dead by the vengeance of Our Lord. With that\nthey heard a voice that said: This vengeance is for blood-shedding of\nmaidens. Also they found at the end of the chapel a churchyard, and\ntherein might they see a three score fair tombs, and that place was so\nfair and so delectable that it seemed them there had been none tempest,\nfor there lay the bodies of all the good maidens which were martyred for\nthe sick lady's sake. Also they found the names of everych, and of what\nblood they were come, and all were of kings' blood, and twelve of them\nwere kings' daughters. Then they departed and went into a forest. Now,\nsaid Percivale unto Galahad, we must depart, so pray we Our Lord that\nwe may meet together in short time: then they did off their helms and\nkissed together, and wept at their departing.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. How Sir Launcelot entered into the ship where Sir\nPercivale's sister lay dead, and how he met with Sir Galahad, his son.\n\n\nNOW saith the history, that when Launcelot was come to the water of\nMortoise, as it is rehearsed before, he was in great peril, and so he\nlaid him down and slept, and took the adventure that God would send him.\nSo when he was asleep there came a vision unto him and said: Launcelot,\narise up and take thine armour, and enter into the first ship that thou\nshalt find. And when he heard these words he start up and saw great\nclearness about him. And then he lift up his hand and blessed him, and\nso took his arms and made him ready; and so by adventure he came by a\nstrand, and found a ship the which was without sail or oar. And as soon\nas he was within the ship there he felt the most sweetness that ever he\nfelt, and he was fulfilled with all thing that he thought on or desired.\nThen he said: Fair sweet Father, Jesu Christ, I wot not in what joy I\nam, for this joy passeth all earthly joys that ever I was in. And so in\nthis joy he laid him down to the ship's board, and slept till day. And\nwhen he awoke he found there a fair bed, and therein lying a gentlewoman\ndead, the which was Sir Percivale's sister. And as Launcelot devised\nher, he espied in her right hand a writ, the which he read, the which\ntold him all the adventures that ye have heard to-fore, and of what\nlineage she was come. So with this gentlewoman Sir Launcelot was a month\nand more. If ye would ask how he lived, He that fed the people of Israel\nwith manna in the desert, so was he fed; for every day when he had said\nhis prayers he was sustained with the grace of the Holy Ghost.\n\nSo on a night he went to play him by the water side, for he was somewhat\nweary of the ship. And then he listened and heard an horse come, and one\nriding upon him. And when he came nigh he seemed a knight. And so he let\nhim pass, and went thereas the ship was; and there he alighted, and took\nthe saddle and the bridle and put the horse from him, and went into the\nship. And then Launcelot dressed unto him, and said: Ye be welcome. And\nhe answered and saluted him again, and asked him: What is your name? for\nmuch my heart giveth unto you. Truly, said he, my name is Launcelot du\nLake. Sir, said he, then be ye welcome, for ye were the beginner of me\nin this world. Ah, said he, are ye Galahad? Yea, forsooth, said he; and\nso he kneeled down and asked him his blessing, and after took off his\nhelm and kissed him. And there was great joy between them, for there is\nno tongue can tell the joy that they made either of other, and many a\nfriendly word spoken between, as kin would, the which is no need here\nto be rehearsed. And there everych told other of their adventures and\nmarvels that were befallen to them in many journeys sith that they\ndeparted from the court.\n\nAnon, as Galahad saw the gentlewoman dead in the bed, he knew her\nwell enough, and told great worship of her, that she was the best maid\nliving, and it was great pity of her death. But when Launcelot heard how\nthe marvellous sword was gotten, and who made it, and all the marvels\nrehearsed afore, then he prayed Galahad, his son, that he would show him\nthe sword, and so he did; and anon he kissed the pommel, and the hilt,\nand the scabbard. Truly, said Launcelot, never erst knew I of so high\nadventures done, and so marvellous and strange. So dwelt Launcelot and\nGalahad within that ship half a year, and served God daily and nightly\nwith all their power; and often they arrived in isles far from folk,\nwhere there repaired none but wild beasts, and there they found many\nstrange adventures and perilous, which they brought to an end; but for\nthose adventures were with wild beasts, and not in the quest of the\nSangreal, therefore the tale maketh here no mention thereof, for it\nwould be too long to tell of all those adventures that befell them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. How a knight brought unto Sir Galahad a horse, and bade him\ncome from his father, Sir Launcelot.\n\n\nSO after, on a Monday, it befell that they arrived in the edge of a\nforest to-fore a cross; and then saw they a knight armed all in white,\nand was richly horsed, and led in his right hand a white horse; and\nso he came to the ship, and saluted the two knights on the High Lord's\nbehalf, and said: Galahad, sir, ye have been long enough with your\nfather, come out of the ship, and start upon this horse, and go where\nthe adventures shall lead thee in the quest of the Sangreal. Then he\nwent to his father and kissed him sweetly, and said: Fair sweet father,\nI wot not when I shall see you more till I see the body of Jesu Christ.\nI pray you, said Launcelot, pray ye to the High Father that He hold me\nin His service. And so he took his horse, and there they heard a voice\nthat said: Think for to do well, for the one shall never see the other\nbefore the dreadful day of doom. Now, son Galahad, said Launcelot,\nsince we shall depart, and never see other, I pray to the High Father to\nconserve me and you both. Sir, said Galahad, no prayer availeth so much\nas yours And therewith Galahad entered into the forest.\n\nAnd the wind arose, and drove Launcelot more than a month throughout the\nsea, where he slept but little, but prayed to God that he might see\nsome tidings of the Sangreal. So it befell on a night, at midnight, he\narrived afore a castle, on the back side, which was rich and fair, and\nthere was a postern opened toward the sea, and was open without any\nkeeping, save two lions kept the entry; and the moon shone clear. Anon\nSir Launcelot heard a voice that said: Launcelot, go out of this ship\nand enter into the castle, where thou shalt see a great part of thy\ndesire. Then he ran to his arms, and so armed him, and so went to the\ngate and saw the lions. Then set he hand to his sword and drew it. Then\nthere came a dwarf suddenly, and smote him on the arm so sore that the\nsword fell out of his hand. Then heard he a voice say: O man of evil\nfaith and poor belief, wherefore trowest thou more on thy harness than\nin thy Maker, for He might more avail thee than thine armour, in whose\nservice that thou art set. Then said Launcelot: Fair Father Jesu Christ,\nI thank thee of Thy great mercy that Thou reprovest me of my misdeed;\nnow see I well that ye hold me for your servant. Then took he again his\nsword and put it up in his sheath, and made a cross in his forehead,\nand came to the lions, and they made semblaunt to do him harm.\nNotwithstanding he passed by them without hurt, and entered into the\ncastle to the chief fortress, and there were they all at rest. Then\nLauncelot entered in so armed, for he found no gate nor door but it was\nopen. And at the last he found a chamber whereof the door was shut, and\nhe set his hand thereto to have opened it, but he might not.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. How Sir Launcelot was to-fore the door of the chamber\nwherein the Holy Sangreal was.\n\n\nTHEN he enforced him mickle to undo the door. Then he listened and heard\na voice which sang so sweetly that it seemed none earthly thing; and him\nthought the voice said: Joy and honour be to the Father of Heaven. Then\nLauncelot kneeled down to-fore the chamber, for well wist he that there\nwas the Sangreal within that chamber. Then said he: Fair sweet Father,\nJesu Christ, if ever I did thing that pleased Thee, Lord for Thy pity\nnever have me not in despite for my sins done aforetime, and that Thou\nshow me something of that I seek. And with that he saw the chamber door\nopen, and there came out a great clearness, that the house was as bright\nas all the torches of the world had been there.\n\nSo came he to the chamber door, and would have entered. And anon a voice\nsaid to him: Flee, Launcelot, and enter not, for thou oughtest not to\ndo it; and if thou enter thou shalt for-think it. Then he withdrew him\naback right heavy. Then looked he up in the midst of the chamber, and\nsaw a table of silver, and the Holy Vessel, covered with red samite, and\nmany angels about it, whereof one held a candle of wax burning, and the\nother held a cross, and the ornaments of an altar. And before the Holy\nVessel he saw a good man clothed as a priest. And it seemed that he was\nat the sacring of the mass. And it seemed to Launcelot that above the\npriest's hands were three men, whereof the two put the youngest by\nlikeness between the priest's hands; and so he lift it up right high,\nand it seemed to show so to the people. And then Launcelot marvelled\nnot a little, for him thought the priest was so greatly charged of the\nfigure that him seemed that he should fall to the earth. And when he\nsaw none about him that would help him, then came he to the door a great\npace, and said: Fair Father Jesu Christ, ne take it for no sin though I\nhelp the good man which hath great need of help.\n\nRight so entered he into the chamber, and came toward the table of\nsilver; and when he came nigh he felt a breath, that him thought it was\nintermeddled with fire, which smote him so sore in the visage that him\nthought it brent his visage; and therewith he fell to the earth, and had\nno power to arise, as he that was so araged, that had lost the power of\nhis body, and his hearing, and his seeing. Then felt he many hands about\nhim, which took him up and bare him out of the chamber door, without any\namending of his swoon, and left him there, seeming dead to all people.\n\nSo upon the morrow when it was fair day they within were arisen, and\nfound Launcelot lying afore the chamber door. All they marvelled how\nthat he came in, and so they looked upon him, and felt his pulse to wit\nwhether there were any life in him; and so they found life in him, but\nhe might not stand nor stir no member that he had. And so they took him\nby every part of the body, and bare him into a chamber, and laid him\nin a rich bed, far from all folk; and so he lay four days. Then the one\nsaid he was alive, and the other said, Nay. In the name of God, said an\nold man, for I do you verily to wit he is not dead, but he is so full of\nlife as the mightiest of you all; and therefore I counsel you that he be\nwell kept till God send him life again.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. How Sir launcelot had lain four-and-twenty days and as many\nnights as a dead man, and other divers matters.\n\n\nIN such manner they kept Launcelot four-and-twenty days and all so many\nnights, that ever he lay still as a dead man; and at the twenty-fifth\nday befell him after midday that he opened his eyes. And when he saw\nfolk he made great sorrow, and said: Why have ye awaked me, for I was\nmore at ease than I am now. O Jesu Christ, who might be so blessed that\nmight see openly thy great marvels of secretness there where no sinner\nmay be! What have ye seen? said they about him. I have seen, said he,\nso great marvels that no tongue may tell, and more than any heart can\nthink, and had not my son been here afore me I had seen much more.\n\nThen they told him how he had lain there four-and-twenty days and\nnights. Then him thought it was punishment for the four-and-twenty\nyears that he had been a sinner, wherefore Our Lord put him in penance\nfour-and-twenty days and nights. Then looked Sir Launcelot afore him,\nand saw the hair which he had borne nigh a year, for that he for-thought\nhim right much that he had broken his promise unto the hermit, which he\nhad avowed to do. Then they asked how it stood with him. Forsooth, said\nhe, I am whole of body, thanked be Our Lord; therefore, sirs, for God's\nlove tell me where I am. Then said they all that he was in the castle of\nCarbonek.\n\nTherewith came a gentlewoman and brought him a shirt of small linen\ncloth, but he changed not there, but took the hair to him again. Sir,\nsaid they, the quest of the Sangreal is achieved now right in you, that\nnever shall ye see of the Sangreal no more than ye have seen. Now I\nthank God, said Launcelot, of His great mercy of that I have seen, for\nit sufficeth me; for as I suppose no man in this world hath lived better\nthan I have done to enchieve that I have done. And therewith he took\nthe hair and clothed him in it, and above that he put a linen shirt, and\nafter a robe of scarlet, fresh and new. And when he was so arrayed they\nmarvelled all, for they knew him that he was Launcelot, the good knight.\nAnd then they said all: O my lord Sir Launcelot, be that ye? And he\nsaid: Truly I am he.\n\nThen came word to King Pelles that the knight that had lain so long dead\nwas Sir Launcelot. Then was the king right glad, and went to see him.\nAnd when Launcelot saw him come he dressed him against him, and there\nmade the king great joy of him. And there the king told him tidings that\nhis fair daughter was dead. Then Launcelot was right heavy of it, and\nsaid: Sir, me forthinketh the death of your daughter, for she was a full\nfair lady, fresh and young. And well I wot she bare the best knight that\nis now on the earth, or that ever was sith God was born. So the king\nheld him there four days, and on the morrow he took his leave at King\nPelles and at all the fellowship, and thanked them of their great\nlabour.\n\nRight so as they sat at their dinner in the chief salle, then was so\nbefallen that the Sangreal had fulfilled the table with all manner of\nmeats that any heart might think. So as they sat they saw all the doors\nand the windows of the place were shut without man's hand, whereof they\nwere all abashed, and none wist what to do.\n\nAnd then it happed suddenly a knight came to the chief door and knocked,\nand cried: Undo the door. But they would not. And ever he cried: Undo;\nbut they would not. And at last it noyed them so much that the king\nhimself arose and came to a window there where the knight called. Then\nhe said: Sir knight, ye shall not enter at this time while the Sangreal\nis here, and therefore go into another; for certes ye be none of the\nknights of the quest, but one of them which hath served the fiend,\nand hast left the service of Our Lord: and he was passing wroth at the\nking's words. Sir knight, said the king, sith ye would so fain enter,\nsay me of what country ye be. Sir, said he, I am of the realm of Logris,\nand my name is Ector de Maris, and brother unto my lord, Sir Launcelot.\nIn the name of God, said the king, me for-thinketh of what I have said,\nfor your brother is here within. And when Ector de Maris understood\nthat his brother was there, for he was the man in the world that he most\ndread and loved, and then he said: Ah God, now doubleth my sorrow and\nshame. Full truly said the good man of the hill unto Gawaine and to me\nof our dreams. Then went he out of the court as fast as his horse might,\nand so throughout the castle.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. How Sir Launcelot returned towards Logris, and of other\nadventures which he saw in the way.\n\n\nTHEN King Pelles came to Sir Launcelot and told him tidings of his\nbrother, whereof he was sorry, that he wist not what to do. So Sir\nLauncelot departed, and took his arms, and said he would go see the\nrealm of Logris, which I have not seen in twelve months. And there with\nhe commended the king to God, and so rode through many realms. And at\nthe last he came to a white abbey, and there they made him that night\ngreat cheer; and on the morn he rose and heard mass. And afore an altar\nhe found a rich tomb, which was newly made; and then he took heed, and\nsaw the sides written with gold which said: Here lieth King Bagdemagus\nof Gore, which King Arthur's nephew slew; and named him, Sir Gawaine.\nThen was not he a little sorry, for Launcelot loved him much more than\nany other, and had it been any other than Gawaine he should not have\nescaped from death to life; and said to himself: Ah Lord God, this is a\ngreat hurt unto King Arthur's court, the loss of such a man. And then\nhe departed and came to the abbey where Galahad did the adventure of\nthe tombs, and won the white shield with the red cross; and there had he\ngreat cheer all that night.\n\nAnd on the morn he turned unto Camelot, where he found King Arthur and\nthe queen. But many of the knights of the Round Table were slain and\ndestroyed, more than half. And so three were come home, Ector, Gawaine,\nand Lionel, and many other that need not to be rehearsed. And all the\ncourt was passing glad of Sir Launcelot, and the king asked him many\ntidings of his son Galahad. And there Launcelot told the king of his\nadventures that had befallen him since he departed. And also he told him\nof the adventures of Galahad, Percivale, and Bors, which that he knew\nby the letter of the dead damosel, and as Galahad had told him. Now God\nwould, said the king, that they were all three here. That shall never\nbe, said Launcelot, for two of them shall ye never see, but one of them\nshall come again.\n\nNow leave we this story and speak of Galahad.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. How Galahad came to King Mordrains, and of other matters\nand adventures.\n\n\nNOW, saith the story, Galahad rode many journeys in vain. And at the\nlast he came to the abbey where King Mordrains was, and when he heard\nthat, he thought he would abide to see him. And upon the morn, when he\nhad heard mass, Galahad came unto King Mordrains, and anon the king saw\nhim, which had lain blind of long time. And then he dressed him against\nhim, and said: Galahad, the servant of Jesu Christ, whose coming I have\nabiden so long, now embrace me and let me rest on thy breast, so that\nI may rest between thine arms, for thou art a clean virgin above all\nknights, as the flower of the lily in whom virginity is signified, and\nthou art the rose the which is the flower of all good virtues, and in\ncolour of fire. For the fire of the Holy Ghost is taken so in thee\nthat my flesh which was all dead of oldness is become young again. Then\nGalahad heard his words, then he embraced him and all his body. Then\nsaid he: Fair Lord Jesu Christ, now I have my will. Now I require thee,\nin this point that I am in, thou come and visit me. And anon Our Lord\nheard his prayer: therewith the soul departed from the body.\n\nAnd then Galahad put him in the earth as a king ought to be, and so\ndeparted and so came into a perilous forest where he found the well the\nwhich boileth with great waves, as the tale telleth to-fore. And as soon\nas Galahad set his hand thereto it ceased, so that it brent no more, and\nthe heat departed. For that it brent it was a sign of lechery, the\nwhich was that time much used. But that heat might not abide his pure\nvirginity. And this was taken in the country for a miracle. And so ever\nafter was it called Galahad's well.\n\nThen by adventure he came into the country of Gore, and into the\nabbey where Launcelot had been to-forehand, and found the tomb of King\nBagdemagus, but he was founder thereof, Joseph of Aramathie's son; and\nthe tomb of Simeon where Launcelot had failed. Then he looked into\na croft under the minster, and there he saw a tomb which brent full\nmarvellously. Then asked he the brethren what it was. Sir, said they,\na marvellous adventure that may not be brought unto none end but by him\nthat passeth of bounty and of knighthood all them of the Round Table. I\nwould, said Galahad, that ye would lead me thereto. Gladly, said they,\nand so led him till a cave. And he went down upon greses, and came nigh\nthe tomb. And then the flaming failed, and the fire staunched, the which\nmany a day had been great. Then came there a voice that said: Much are\nye beholden to thank Our Lord, the which hath given you a good hour,\nthat ye may draw out the souls of earthly pain, and to put them into the\njoys of paradise. I am of your kindred, the which hath dwelled in this\nheat this three hundred winter and four-and-fifty to be purged of the\nsin that I did against Joseph of Aramathie. Then Galahad took the body\nin his arms and bare it into the minster. And that night lay Galahad in\nthe abbey; and on the morn he gave him service, and put him in the earth\nafore the high altar.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. How Sir Percivale and Sir Bors met with Sir Galahad, and\nhow they came to the castle of Carbonek, and other matters.\n\n\nSO departed he from thence, and commended the brethren to God; and so he\nrode five days till that he came to the Maimed King. And ever followed\nPercivale the five days, asking where he had been; and so one told him\nhow the adventures of Logris were enchieved. So on a day it befell that\nthey came out of a great forest, and there they met at traverse with Sir\nBors, the which rode alone. It is none need to tell if they were glad;\nand them he saluted, and they yielded him honour and good adventure,\nand everych told other. Then said Bors: It is mo than a year and an half\nthat I ne lay ten times where men dwelled, but in wild forests and in\nmountains, but God was ever my comfort.\n\nThen rode they a great while till that they came to the castle of\nCarbonek. And when they were entered within the castle King Pelles knew\nthem; then there was great joy, for they wist well by their coming that\nthey had fulfilled the quest of the Sangreal. Then Eliazar, King Pelles'\nson, brought to-fore them the broken sword wherewith Joseph was stricken\nthrough the thigh. Then Bors set his hand thereto, if that he might have\nsoldered it again; but it would not be. Then he took it to Percivale,\nbut he had no more power thereto than he. Now have ye it again, said\nPercivale to Galahad, for an it be ever enchieved by any bodily man ye\nmust do it. And then he took the pieces and set them together, and they\nseemed that they had never been broken, and as well as it had been first\nforged. And when they within espied that the adventure of the sword was\nenchieved, then they gave the sword to Bors, for it might not be better\nset; for he was a good knight and a worthy man.\n\nAnd a little afore even the sword arose great and marvellous, and was\nfull of great heat that many men fell for dread. And anon alighted a\nvoice among them, and said: They that ought not to sit at the table\nof Jesu Christ arise, for now shall very knights be fed. So they went\nthence, all save King Pelles and Eliazar, his son, the which were holy\nmen, and a maid which was his niece; and so these three fellows and they\nthree were there, no mo. Anon they saw knights all armed came in at\nthe hall door, and did off their helms and their arms, and said unto\nGalahad: Sir, we have hied right much for to be with you at this table\nwhere the holy meat shall be departed. Then said he: Ye be welcome,\nbut of whence be ye? So three of them said they were of Gaul, and other\nthree said they were of Ireland, and the other three said they were of\nDenmark. So as they sat thus there came out a bed of tree, of a chamber,\nthe which four gentlewomen brought; and in the bed lay a good man sick,\nand a crown of gold upon his head; and there in the midst of the place\nthey set him down, and went again their way. Then he lift up his head,\nand said: Galahad, Knight, ye be welcome, for much have I desired your\ncoming, for in such pain and in such anguish I have been long. But now\nI trust to God the term is come that my pain shall be allayed, that\nI shall pass out of this world so as it was promised me long ago.\nTherewith a voice said: There be two among you that be not in the quest\nof the Sangreal, and therefore depart ye.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX How Galahad and his fellows were fed of the Holy Sangreal,\nand how Our Lord appeared to them, and other things.\n\n\nTHEN King Pelles and his son departed. And therewithal beseemed them\nthat there came a man, and four angels from heaven, clothed in likeness\nof a bishop, and had a cross in his hand; and these four angels bare him\nup in a chair, and set him down before the table of silver where upon\nthe Sangreal was; and it seemed that he had in midst of his forehead\nletters the which said: See ye here Joseph, the first bishop of\nChristendom, the same which Our Lord succoured in the city of Sarras\nin the spiritual place. Then the knights marvelled, for that bishop was\ndead more than three hundred year to-fore. O knights, said he, marvel\nnot, for I was sometime an earthly man. With that they heard the chamber\ndoor open, and there they saw angels; and two bare candles of wax, and\nthe third a towel, and the fourth a spear which bled marvellously, that\nthree drops fell within a box which he held with his other hand. And\nthey set the candles upon the table, and the third the towel upon the\nvessel, and the fourth the holy spear even upright upon the vessel.\nAnd then the bishop made semblaunt as though he would have gone to\nthe sacring of the mass. And then he took an ubblie which was made in\nlikeness of bread. And at the lifting up there came a figure in likeness\nof a child, and the visage was as red and as bright as any fire, and\nsmote himself into the bread, so that they all saw it that the bread was\nformed of a fleshly man; and then he put it into the Holy Vessel again,\nand then he did that longed to a priest to do to a mass. And then he\nwent to Galahad and kissed him, and bade him go and kiss his fellows:\nand so he did anon. Now, said he, servants of Jesu Christ, ye shall be\nfed afore this table with sweet meats that never knights tasted. And\nwhen he had said, he vanished away. And they set them at the table in\ngreat dread, and made their prayers.\n\nThen looked they and saw a man come out of the Holy Vessel, that had all\nthe signs of the passion of Jesu Christ, bleeding all openly, and said:\nMy knights, and my servants, and my true children, which be come out of\ndeadly life into spiritual life, I will now no longer hide me from you,\nbut ye shall see now a part of my secrets and of my hidden things: now\nhold and receive the high meat which ye have so much desired. Then took\nhe himself the Holy Vessel and came to Galahad; and he kneeled down,\nand there he received his Saviour, and after him so received all his\nfellows; and they thought it so sweet that it was marvellous to tell.\nThen said he to Galahad: Son, wottest thou what I hold betwixt my hands?\nNay, said he, but if ye will tell me. This is, said he, the holy dish\nwherein I ate the lamb on Sheer-Thursday. And now hast thou seen that\nthou most desired to see, but yet hast thou not seen it so openly\nas thou shalt see it in the city of Sarras in the spiritual place.\nTherefore thou must go hence and bear with thee this Holy Vessel; for\nthis night it shall depart from the realm of Logris, that it shall never\nbe seen more here. And wottest thou wherefore? For he is not served nor\nworshipped to his right by them of this land, for they be turned to evil\nliving; therefore I shall disherit them of the honour which I have done\nthem. And therefore go ye three to-morrow unto the sea, where ye shall\nfind your ship ready, and with you take the sword with the strange\ngirdles, and no more with you but Sir Percivale and Sir Bors. Also I\nwill that ye take with you of the blood of this spear for to anoint\nthe Maimed King, both his legs and all his body, and he shall have his\nhealth. Sir, said Galahad, why shall not these other fellows go with us?\nFor this cause: for right as I departed my apostles one here and another\nthere, so I will that ye depart; and two of you shall die in my service,\nbut one of you shall come again and tell tidings. Then gave he them his\nblessing and vanished away.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. How Galahad anointed with the blood of the spear the Maimed\nKing, and of other adventures.\n\n\nAND Galahad went anon to the spear which lay upon the table, and touched\nthe blood with his fingers, and came after to the Maimed King and\nanointed his legs. And therewith he clothed him anon, and start upon his\nfeet out of his bed as an whole man, and thanked Our Lord that He had\nhealed him. And that was not to the worldward, for anon he yielded him\nto a place of religion of white monks, and was a full holy man. That\nsame night about midnight came a voice among them which said: My sons\nand not my chief sons, my friends and not my warriors, go ye hence where\nye hope best to do and as I bade you. Ah, thanked' be Thou, Lord, that\nThou wilt vouchsafe to call us, Thy sinners. Now may we well prove\nthat we have not lost our pains. And anon in all haste they took their\nharness and departed. But the three knights of Gaul, one of them hight\nClaudine, King Claudas' son, and the other two were great gentlemen.\nThen prayed Galahad to everych of them, that if they come to King\nArthur's court that they should salute my lord, Sir Launcelot, my\nfather, and all the fellowship[1] of the Round Table; and prayed them if\nthat they came on that part that they should not forget it.\n\nRight so departed Galahad, Percivale and Bors with him; and so they rode\nthree days, and then they came to a rivage, and found the ship whereof\nthe tale speaketh of\n\n[1] So W. de Worde; Caxton \"of them.\"\n\nto-fore. And when they came to the board they found in the midst the\ntable of silver which they had left with the Maimed King, and the\nSangreal which was covered with red samite. Then were they glad to have\nsuch things in their fellowship; and so they entered and made great\nreverence thereto; and Galahad fell in his prayer long time to Our Lord,\nthat at what time he asked, that he should pass out of this world. So\nmuch he prayed till a voice said to him: Galahad, thou shalt have thy\nrequest; and when thou askest the death of thy body thou shalt have it,\nand then shalt thou find the life of the soul. Percivale heard this, and\nprayed him, of fellowship that was between them, to tell him wherefore\nhe asked such things. That shall I tell you, said Galahad; the other day\nwhen we saw a part of the adventures of the Sangreal I was in such a joy\nof heart, that I trow never man was that was earthly. And therefore I\nwot well, when my body is dead my soul shall be in great joy to see the\nblessed Trinity every day, and the majesty of Our Lord, Jesu Christ.\n\nSo long were they in the ship that they said to Galahad: Sir, in this\nbed ought ye to lie, for so saith the scripture. And so he laid him down\nand slept a great while; and when he awaked he looked afore him and\nsaw the city of Sarras. And as they would have landed they saw the ship\nwherein Percivale had put his sister in. Truly, said Percivale, in the\nname of God, well hath my sister holden us covenant. Then took they\nout of the ship the table of silver, and he took it to Percivale and to\nBors, to go to-fore, and Galahad came behind. And right so they went to\nthe city, and at the gate of the city they saw an old man crooked. Then\nGalahad called him and bade him help to bear this heavy thing. Truly,\nsaid the old man, it is ten year ago that I might not go but with\ncrutches. Care thou not, said Galahad, and arise up and shew thy good\nwill. And so he assayed, and found himself as whole as ever he was. Than\nran he to the table, and took one part against Galahad. And anon arose\nthere great noise in the city, that a cripple was made whole by knights\nmarvellous that entered into the city.\n\nThen anon after, the three knights went to the water, and brought up\ninto the palace Percivale's sister, and buried her as richly as a king's\ndaughter ought to be. And when the king of the city, which was cleped\nEstorause, saw the fellowship, he asked them of whence they were, and\nwhat thing it was that they had brought upon the table of silver. And\nthey told him the truth of the Sangreal, and the power which that God\nhad sent there. Then the king was a tyrant, and was come of the line of\npaynims, and took them and put them in prison in a deep hole.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. How they were fed with the Sangreal while they were in\nprison, and how Galahad was made king.\n\n\nBUT as soon as they were there Our Lord sent them the Sangreal, through\nwhose grace they were always fulfilled while that they were in prison.\nSo at the year's end it befell that this King Estorause lay sick, and\nfelt that he should die. Then he sent for the three knights, and they\ncame afore him; and he cried them mercy of that he had done to them, and\nthey forgave it him goodly; and he died anon. When the king was dead all\nthe city was dismayed, and wist not who might be their king. Right so as\nthey were in counsel there came a voice among them, and bade them choose\nthe youngest knight of them three to be their king: For he shall well\nmaintain you and all yours. So they made Galahad king by all the assent\nof the holy city, and else they would have slain him. And when he was\ncome to behold the land, he let make above the table of silver a chest\nof gold and of precious stones, that hilled the Holy Vessel. And every\nday early the three fellows would come afore it, and make their prayers.\n\nNow at the year's end, and the self day after Galahad had borne the\ncrown of gold, he arose up early and his fellows, and came to the\npalace, and saw to-fore them the Holy Vessel, and a man kneeling on his\nknees in likeness of a bishop, that had about him a great fellowship of\nangels, as it had been Jesu Christ himself; and then he arose and began\na mass of Our Lady. And when he came to the sacrament of the mass,\nand had done, anon he called Galahad, and said to him: Come forth the\nservant of Jesu Christ, and thou shalt see that thou hast much desired\nto see. And then he began to tremble right hard when the deadly flesh\nbegan to behold the spiritual things. Then he held up his hands toward\nheaven and said: Lord, I thank thee, for now I see that that hath been\nmy desire many a day. Now, blessed Lord, would I not longer live, if it\nmight please thee, Lord. And therewith the good man took Our Lord's body\nbetwixt his hands, and proffered it to Galahad, and he received it right\ngladly and meekly. Now wottest thou what I am? said the good man. Nay,\nsaid Galahad. I am Joseph of Aramathie, the which Our Lord hath sent\nhere to thee to bear thee fellowship; and wottest thou wherefore that\nhe hath sent me more than any other? For thou hast resembled me in two\nthings; in that thou hast seen the marvels of the Sangreal, in that thou\nhast been a clean maiden, as I have been and am.\n\nAnd when he had said these words Galahad went to Percivale and kissed\nhim, and commended him to God; and so he went to Sir Bors and kissed\nhim, and commended him to God, and said: Fair lord, salute me to my\nlord, Sir Launcelot, my father, and as soon as ye see him, bid him\nremember of this unstable world. And therewith he kneeled down to-fore\nthe table and made his prayers, and then suddenly his soul departed to\nJesu Christ, and a great multitude of angels bare his soul up to heaven,\nthat the two fellows might well behold it. Also the two fellows saw come\nfrom heaven an hand, but they saw not the body. And then it came right\nto the Vessel, and took it and the spear, and so bare it up to heaven.\nSithen was there never man so hardy to say that he had seen the\nSangreal.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII. Of the sorrow that Percivale and Bors made when Galahad\nwas dead: and of Percivale how he died, and other matters.\n\n\nWHEN Percivale and Bors saw Galahad dead they made as much sorrow as\never did two men. And if they had not been good men they might lightly\nhave fallen in despair. And the people of the country and of the city\nwere right heavy. And then he was buried; and as soon as he was buried\nSir Percivale yielded him to an hermitage out of the city, and took a\nreligious clothing. And Bors was alway with him, but never changed he\nhis secular clothing, for that he purposed him to go again into the\nrealm of Logris. Thus a year and two months lived Sir Percivale in the\nhermitage a full holy life, and then passed out of this world; and Bors\nlet bury him by his sister and by Galahad in the spiritualities.\n\nWhen Bors saw that he was in so far countries as in the parts of Babylon\nhe departed from Sarras, and armed him and came to the sea, and entered\ninto a ship; and so it befell him in good adventure he came into the\nrealm of Logris; and he rode so fast till he came to Camelot where the\nking was. And then was there great joy made of him in the court, for\nthey weened all he had been dead, forasmuch as he had been so long out\nof the country. And when they had eaten, the king made great clerks to\ncome afore him, that they should chronicle of the high adventures of the\ngood knights. When Bors had told him of the adventures of the Sangreal,\nsuch as had befallen him and his three fellows, that was Launcelot,\nPercivale, Galahad, and himself, there Launcelot told the adventures of\nthe Sangreal that he had seen. All this was made in great books, and put\nup in almeries at Salisbury. And anon Sir Bors said to Sir Launcelot:\nGalahad, your own son, saluted you by me, and after you King Arthur and\nall the court, and so did Sir Percivale, for I buried them with mine own\nhands in the city of Sarras. Also, Sir Launcelot, Galahad prayed you to\nremember of this unsiker world as ye behight him when ye were together\nmore than half a year. This is true, said Launcelot; now I trust to God\nhis prayer shall avail me.\n\nThen Launcelot took Sir Bors in his arms, and said: Gentle cousin, ye\nare right welcome to me, and all that ever I may do for you and for\nyours ye shall find my poor body ready at all times, while the spirit is\nin it, and that I promise you faithfully, and never to fail. And wit ye\nwell, gentle cousin, Sir Bors, that ye and I will never depart asunder\nwhilst our lives may last. Sir, said he, I will as ye will.\n\n_Thus endeth the history of the Sangreal, that was briefly drawn out\nof French into English, the which is a story chronicled for one of the\ntruest and the holiest that is in this world, the which is the xvii\nbook.\n\n\nAnd here followeth the eighteenth book._\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XVIII.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Of the joy King Arthur and the queen had of the achievement\nof the Sangreal; and how Launcelot fell to his old love again.\n\n\nSO after the quest of the Sangreal was fulfilled, and all knights that\nwere left alive were come again unto the Table Round, as the book of the\nSangreal maketh mention, then was there great joy in the court; and in\nespecial King Arthur and Queen Guenever made great joy of the remnant\nthat were come home, and passing glad was the king and the queen of Sir\nLauncelot and of Sir Bors, for they had been passing long away in the\nquest of the Sangreal.\n\nThen, as the book saith, Sir Launcelot began to resort unto Queen\nGuenever again, and forgat the promise and the perfection that he made\nin the quest. For, as the book saith, had not Sir Launcelot been in his\nprivy thoughts and in his mind so set inwardly to the queen as he was in\nseeming outward to God, there had no knight passed him in the quest of\nthe Sangreal; but ever his thoughts were privily on the queen, and so\nthey loved together more hotter than they did to-forehand, and had such\nprivy draughts together, that many in the court spake of it, and\nin especial Sir Agravaine, Sir Gawaine's brother, for he was ever\nopen-mouthed.\n\nSo befell that Sir Launcelot had many resorts of ladies and damosels\nthat daily resorted unto him, that besought him to be their champion,\nand in all such matters of right Sir Launcelot applied him daily to do\nfor the pleasure of Our Lord, Jesu Christ. And ever as much as he might\nhe withdrew him from the company and fellowship of Queen Guenever, for\nto eschew the slander and noise; wherefore the queen waxed wroth with\nSir Launcelot. And upon a day she called Sir Launcelot unto her chamber,\nand said thus: Sir Launcelot, I see and feel daily that thy love\nbeginneth to slake, for thou hast no joy to be in my presence, but ever\nthou art out of this court, and quarrels and matters thou hast nowadays\nfor ladies and gentlewomen more than ever thou wert wont to have\naforehand.\n\nAh madam, said Launcelot, in this ye must hold me excused for divers\ncauses; one is, I was but late in the quest of the Sangreal; and I thank\nGod of his great mercy, and never of my desert, that I saw in that my\nquest as much as ever saw any sinful man, and so was it told me. And if\nI had not had my privy thoughts to return to your love again as I do,\nI had seen as great mysteries as ever saw my son Galahad, outher\nPercivale, or Sir Bors; and therefore, madam, I was but late in that\nquest. Wit ye well, madam, it may not be yet lightly forgotten the high\nservice in whom I did my diligent labour. Also, madam, wit ye well that\nthere be many men speak of our love in this court, and have you and me\ngreatly in await, as Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred; and madam, wit ye\nwell I dread them more for your sake than for any fear I have of them\nmyself, for I may happen to escape and rid myself in a great need, where\nye must abide all that will be said unto you. And then if that ye fall\nin any distress through wilful folly, then is there none other remedy or\nhelp but by me and my blood. And wit ye well, madam, the boldness of you\nand me will bring us to great shame and slander; and that were me loath\nto see you dishonoured. And that is the cause I take upon me more for\nto do for damosels and maidens than ever I did to-fore, that men should\nunderstand my joy and my delight is my pleasure to have ado for damosels\nand maidens.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. How the queen commanded Sir Launcelot to avoid the court,\nand of the sorrow that Launcelot made.\n\n\nALL this while the queen stood still and let Sir Launcelot say what\nhe would. And when he had all said she brast out a-weeping, and so\nshe sobbed and wept a great while. And when she might speak she said:\nLauncelot, now I well understand that thou art a false recreant knight\nand a common lecher, and lovest and holdest other ladies, and by me thou\nhast disdain and scorn. For wit thou well, she said, now I understand\nthy falsehood, and therefore shall I never love thee no more. And never\nbe thou so hardy to come in my sight; and right here I discharge thee\nthis court, that thou never come within it; and I forfend thee my\nfellowship, and upon pain of thy head that thou see me no more. Right\nso Sir Launcelot departed with great heaviness, that unnethe he might\nsustain himself for great dole-making.\n\nThen he called Sir Bors, Sir Ector de Maris, and Sir Lionel, and told\nthem how the queen had forfended him the court, and so he was in will to\ndepart into his own country. Fair sir, said Sir Bors de Ganis, ye shall\nnot depart out of this land by mine advice. Ye must remember in what\nhonour ye are renowned, and called the noblest knight of the world; and\nmany great matters ye have in hand. And women in their hastiness will do\nofttimes that sore repenteth them; and therefore by mine advice ye shall\ntake your horse, and ride to the good hermitage here beside Windsor,\nthat sometime was a good knight, his name is Sir Brasias, and there\nshall ye abide till I send you word of better tidings. Brother, said Sir\nLauncelot, wit ye well I am full loath to depart out of this realm, but\nthe queen hath defended me so highly, that meseemeth she will never be\nmy good lady as she hath been. Say ye never so, said Sir Bors, for many\ntimes or this time she hath been wroth with you, and after it she was\nthe first that repented it. Ye say well, said Launcelot, for now will I\ndo by your counsel, and take mine horse and my harness, and ride to the\nhermit Sir Brasias, and there will I repose me until I hear some manner\nof tidings from you; but, fair brother, I pray you get me the love of my\nlady, Queen Guenever, an ye may Sir, said Sir Bors, ye need not to move\nme of such matters, for well ye wot I will do what I may to please you.\n\nAnd then the noble knight, Sir Launcelot, departed with right heavy\ncheer suddenly, that none earthly creature wist of him, nor where he\nwas become, but Sir Bors. So when Sir Launcelot was departed, the queen\noutward made no manner of sorrow in showing to none of his blood nor to\nnone other. But wit ye well, inwardly, as the book saith, she took great\nthought, but she bare it out with a proud countenance as though she felt\nnothing nor danger.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. How at a dinner that the queen made there was a knight\nenpoisoned, which Sir Mador laid on the queen.\n\n\nAND then the queen let make a privy dinner in London unto the knights of\nthe Round Table. And all was for to show outward that she had as great\njoy in all other knights of the Table Round as she had in Sir Launcelot.\nAll only at that dinner she had Sir Gawaine and his brethren, that is\nfor to say Sir Agravaine, Sir Gaheris, Sir Gareth, and Sir Mordred.\nAlso there was Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir Blamore de Ganis, Sir Bleoberis de\nGanis, Sir Galihud, Sir Galihodin, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir Lionel, Sir\nPalomides, Safere his brother, Sir La Cote Male Taile, Sir Persant, Sir\nIronside, Sir Brandiles, Sir Kay le Seneschal, Sir Mador de la Porte,\nSir Patrise, a knight of Ireland, Aliduk, Sir Astamore, and Sir Pinel\nle Savage, the which was cousin to Sir Lamorak de Galis, the good\nknight that Sir Gawaine and his brethren slew by treason. And so these\nfour-and-twenty knights should dine with the queen in a privy place by\nthemself, and there was made a great feast of all manner of dainties.\n\nBut Sir Gawaine had a custom that he used daily at dinner and at supper,\nthat he loved well all manner of fruit, and in especial apples and\npears. And therefore whosomever dined or feasted Sir Gawaine would\ncommonly purvey for good fruit for him, and so did the queen for to\nplease Sir Gawaine; she let purvey for him all manner of fruit, for Sir\nGawaine was a passing hot knight of nature. And this Pinel hated Sir\nGawaine because of his kinsman Sir Lamorak de Galis; and therefore for\npure envy and hate Sir Pinel enpoisoned certain apples for to enpoison\nSir Gawaine. And so this was well unto the end of the meat; and so it\nbefell by misfortune a good knight named Patrise, cousin unto Sir Mador\nde la Porte, to take a poisoned apple. And when he had eaten it he\nswelled so till he brast, and there Sir Patrise fell down suddenly dead\namong them.\n\nThen every knight leapt from the board ashamed, and araged for wrath,\nnigh out of their wits. For they wist not what to say; considering Queen\nGuenever made the feast and dinner, they all had suspicion unto her. My\nlady, the queen, said Gawaine, wit ye well, madam, that this dinner was\nmade for me, for all folks that know my condition understand that I love\nwell fruit, and now I see well I had near been slain; therefore, madam,\nI dread me lest ye will be shamed. Then the queen stood still and was\nsore abashed, that she nist not what to say. This shall not so be ended,\nsaid Sir Mador de la Porte, for here have I lost a full noble knight of\nmy blood; and therefore upon this shame and despite I will be revenged\nto the utterance. And there openly Sir Mador appealed the queen of the\ndeath of his cousin, Sir Patrise. Then stood they all still, that none\nwould speak a word against him, for they all had great suspicion unto\nthe queen because she let make that dinner. And the queen was so abashed\nthat she could none other ways do, but wept so heartily that she fell in\na swoon. With this noise and cry came to them King Arthur, and when he\nwist of that trouble he was a passing heavy man.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. How Sir Mador appeached the queen of treason, and there was\nno knight would fight for her at the first time.\n\n\nAND ever Sir Mador stood still afore the king, and ever he appealed the\nqueen of treason; for the custom was such that time that all manner\nof shameful death was called treason. Fair lords, said King Arthur, me\nrepenteth of this trouble, but the case is so I may not have ado in this\nmatter, for I must be a rightful judge; and that repenteth me that I may\nnot do battle for my wife, for as I deem this deed came never by her.\nAnd therefore I suppose she shall not be all distained, but that some\ngood knight shall put his body in jeopardy for my queen rather than she\nshall be brent in a wrong quarrel. And therefore, Sir Mador, be not so\nhasty, for it may happen she shall not be all friendless; and therefore\ndesire thou thy day of battle, and she shall purvey her of some good\nknight that shall answer you, or else it were to me great shame, and to\nall my court.\n\nMy gracious lord, said Sir Mador, ye must hold me excused, for though\nye be our king in that degree, ye are but a knight as we are, and ye are\nsworn unto knighthood as well as we; and therefore I beseech you that ye\nbe not displeased, for there is none of the four-and-twenty knights that\nwere bidden to this dinner but all they have great suspicion unto the\nqueen. What say ye all, my lords? said Sir Mador. Then they answered\nby and by that they could not excuse the queen; for why she made the\ndinner, and either it must come by her or by her servants. Alas, said\nthe queen, I made this dinner for a good intent, and never for none\nevil, so Almighty God me help in my right, as I was never purposed to do\nsuch evil deeds, and that I report me unto God.\n\nMy lord, the king, said Sir Mador, I require you as ye be a righteous\nking give me a day that I may have justice. Well, said the king, I give\nthe day this day fifteen days that thou be ready armed on horseback\nin the meadow beside Westminster. And if it so fall that there be any\nknight to encounter with you, there mayst thou do the best, and God\nspeed the right. And if it so fall that there be no knight at that day,\nthen must my queen be burnt, and there she shall be ready to have her\njudgment. I am answered, said Sir Mador. And every knight went where it\nliked them.\n\nSo when the king and the queen were together the king asked the queen\nhow this case befell. The queen answered: So God me help, I wot not how\nor in what manner. Where is Sir Launcelot? said King Arthur; an he were\nhere he would not grudge to do battle for you. Sir, said the queen, I\nwot not where he is, but his brother and his kinsmen deem that he be not\nwithin this realm. That me repenteth, said King Arthur, for an he were\nhere he would soon stint this strife. Then I will counsel you, said\nthe king, and unto Sir Bors: That ye will do battle for her for Sir\nLauncelot's sake, and upon my life he will not refuse you. For well I\nsee, said the king, that none of these four-and-twenty knights that were\nwith you at your dinner where Sir Patrise was slain, that will do battle\nfor you, nor none of them will say well of you, and that shall be a\ngreat slander for you in this court. Alas, said the queen, and I may not\ndo withal, but now I miss Sir Launcelot, for an he were here he would\nput me soon to my heart's ease. What aileth you, said the king, ye\ncannot keep Sir Launcelot upon your side? For wit ye well, said the\nking, who that hath Sir Launcelot upon his part hath the most man of\nworship in the world upon his side. Now go your way, said the king unto\nthe queen, and require Sir Bors to do battle for you for Sir Launcelot's\nsake.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. How the queen required Sir Bors to fight for her, and how he\ngranted upon condition; and how he warned Sir Launcelot thereof.\n\n\nSO the queen departed from the king, and sent for Sir Bors into her\nchamber. And when he was come she besought him of succour. Madam, said\nhe, what would ye that I did? for I may not with my worship have ado\nin this matter, because I was at the same dinner, for dread that any of\nthose knights would have me in suspicion. Also, madam, said Sir Bors,\nnow miss ye Sir Launcelot, for he would not have failed you neither in\nright nor in wrong, as ye have well proved when ye have been in danger;\nand now ye have driven him out of this country, by whom ye and all we\nwere daily worshipped by; therefore, madam, I marvel how ye dare for\nshame require me to do any thing for you, in so much ye have chased him\nout of your country by whom we were borne up and honoured. Alas, fair\nknight, said the queen, I put me wholly in your grace, and all that is\ndone amiss I will amend as ye will counsel me. And therewith she kneeled\ndown upon both her knees, and besought Sir Bors to have mercy upon her:\nOuther I shall have a shameful death, and thereto I never offended.\n\nRight so came King Arthur, and found the queen kneeling afore Sir Bors;\nthen Sir Bors pulled her up, and said: Madam, ye do me great dishonour.\nAh, gentle knight, said the king, have mercy upon my queen, courteous\nknight, for I am now in certain she is untruly defamed. And therefore,\ncourteous knight, said the king, promise her to do battle for her, I\nrequire you for the love of Sir Launcelot. My lord, said Sir Bors, ye\nrequire me the greatest thing that any man may require me; and wit ye\nwell if I grant to do battle for the queen I shall wrath many of my\nfellowship of the Table Round. But as for that, said Bors, I will grant\nmy lord that for my lord Sir Launcelot's sake, and for your sake I will\nat that day be the queen's champion unless that there come by adventure\na better knight than I am to do battle for her. Will ye promise me this,\nsaid the king, by your faith? Yea sir, said Sir Bors, of that I will not\nfail you, nor her both, but if there come a better knight than I am, and\nthen shall he have the battle. Then was the king and the queen passing\nglad, and so departed, and thanked him heartily.\n\nSo then Sir Bors departed secretly upon a day, and rode unto Sir\nLauncelot thereas he was with the hermit, Sir Brasias, and told him of\nall their adventure. Ah Jesu, said Sir Launcelot, this is come happily\nas I would have it, and therefore I pray you make you ready to do\nbattle, but look that ye tarry till ye see me come, as long as ye may.\nFor I am sure Mador is an hot knight when he is enchafed, for the more\nye suffer him the hastier will he be to battle. Sir, said Bors, let me\ndeal with him, doubt ye not ye shall have all your will. Then departed\nSir Bors from him and came to the court again. Then was it noised in all\nthe court that Sir Bors should do battle for the queen; wherefore many\nknights were displeased with him, that he would take upon him to do\nbattle in the queen's quarrel; for there were but few knights in all the\ncourt but they deemed the queen was in the wrong, and that she had done\nthat treason.\n\nSo Sir Bors answered thus to his fellows of the Table Round: Wit ye\nwell, my fair lords, it were shame to us all an we suffered to see the\nmost noble queen of the world to be shamed openly, considering her\nlord and our lord is the man of most worship in the world, and most\nchristened, and he hath ever worshipped us all in all places. Many\nanswered him again: As for our most noble King Arthur, we love him and\nhonour him as well as ye do, but as for Queen Guenever we love her not,\nbecause she is a destroyer of good knights. Fair lords, said Sir Bors,\nmeseemeth ye say not as ye should say, for never yet in my days knew I\nnever nor heard say that ever she was a destroyer of any good knight.\nBut at all times as far as ever I could know she was a maintainer of\ngood knights; and ever she hath been large and free of her goods to\nall good knights, and the most bounteous lady of her gifts and her good\ngrace, that ever I saw or heard speak of. And therefore it were shame,\nsaid Sir Bors, to us all to our most noble king's wife, an we suffered\nher to be shamefully slain. And wit ye well, said Sir Bors, I will\nnot suffer it, for I dare say so much, the queen is not guilty of Sir\nPatrise's death, for she owed him never none ill will, nor none of the\nfour-and-twenty knights that were at that dinner; for I dare say for\ngood love she bade us to dinner, and not for no mal engine, and that\nI doubt not shall be proved hereafter, for howsomever the game goeth,\nthere was treason among us. Then some said to Sir Bors: We may well\nbelieve your words. And so some of them were well pleased, and some were\nnot so.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. How at the day Sir Bors made him ready for to fight for the\nqueen; and when he would fight how another discharged him.\n\n\nTHE day came on fast until the even that the battle should be. Then the\nqueen sent for Sir Bors and asked him how he was disposed. Truly madam,\nsaid he, I am disposed in likewise as I promised you, that is for to\nsay I shall not fail you, unless by adventure there come a better knight\nthan I am to do battle for you, then, madam, am I discharged of my\npromise. Will ye, said the queen, that I tell my lord Arthur thus? Do as\nit shall please you, madam. Then the queen went unto the king and told\nhim the answer of Sir Bors. Have ye no doubt, said the king, of Sir\nBors, for I call him now one of the best knights of the world, and the\nmost profitablest man. And thus it passed on until the morn, and the\nking and the queen and all manner of knights that were there at that\ntime drew them unto the meadow beside Westminster where the battle\nshould be. And so when the king was come with the queen and many knights\nof the Round Table, then the queen was put there in the Constable's\nward, and a great fire made about an iron stake, that an Sir Mador de la\nPorte had the better, she should be burnt: such custom was used in those\ndays, that neither for favour, neither for love nor affinity, there\nshould be none other but righteous judgment, as well upon a king as upon\na knight, and as well upon a queen as upon another poor lady.\n\nSo in this meanwhile came in Sir Mador de la Porte, and took his oath\nafore the king, that the queen did this treason until his cousin Sir\nPatrise, and unto his oath he would prove it with his body, hand for\nhand, who that would say the contrary. Right so came in Sir Bors de\nGanis, and said: That as for Queen Guenever she is in the right, and\nthat will I make good with my hands that she is not culpable of this\ntreason that is put upon her. Then make thee ready, said Sir Mador, and\nwe shall prove whether thou be in the right or I. Sir Mador, said Sir\nBors, wit thou well I know you for a good knight. Not for then I shall\nnot fear you so greatly, but I trust to God I shall be able to withstand\nyour malice. But this much have I promised my lord Arthur and my lady\nthe queen, that I shall do battle for her in this case to the uttermost,\nunless that there come a better knight than I am and discharge me. Is\nthat all? said Sir Mador, either come thou off and do battle with me, or\nelse say nay. Take your horse, said Sir Bors, and as I suppose, ye shall\nnot tarry long but ye shall be answered.\n\nThen either departed to their tents and made them ready to horseback\nas they thought best. And anon Sir Mador came into the field with his\nshield on his shoulder and his spear in his hand; and so rode about the\nplace crying unto Arthur: Bid your champion come forth an he dare. Then\nwas Sir Bors ashamed and took his horse and came to the lists' end.\nAnd then was he ware where came from a wood there fast by a knight all\narmed, upon a white horse, with a strange shield of strange arms; and he\ncame riding all that he might run, and so he came to Sir Bors, and said\nthus: Fair knight, I pray you be not displeased, for here must a better\nknight than ye are have this battle, therefore I pray you withdraw you.\nFor wit ye well I have had this day a right great journey, and this\nbattle ought to be mine, and so I promised you when I spake with you\nlast, and with all my heart I thank you of your good will. Then Sir\nBors rode unto King Arthur and told him how there was a knight come that\nwould have the battle for to fight for the queen. What knight is he?\nsaid the king. I wot not, said Sir Bors, but such covenant he made\nwith me to be here this day. Now my lord, said Sir Bors, here am I\ndischarged.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII How Sir Launcelot fought against Sir Mador for the queen,\nand how he overcame Sir Mador, and discharged the queen.\n\n\nTHEN the king called to that knight, and asked him if he would fight for\nthe queen. Then he answered to the king: Therefore came I hither, and\ntherefore, sir king, he said, tarry me no longer, for I may not tarry.\nFor anon as I have finished this battle I must depart hence, for I have\nado many matters elsewhere. For wit you well, said that knight, this\nis dishonour to you all knights of the Round Table, to see and know so\nnoble a lady and so courteous a queen as Queen Guenever is, thus to be\nrebuked and shamed amongst you. Then they all marvelled what knight that\nmight be that so took the battle upon him. For there was not one that\nknew him, but if it were Sir Bors.\n\nThen said Sir Mador de la Porte unto the king: Now let me wit with whom\nI shall have ado withal. And then they rode to the lists' end, and there\nthey couched their spears, and ran together with all their might, and\nSir Mador's spear brake all to pieces, but the other's spear held, and\nbare Sir Mador's horse and all backward to the earth a great fall. But\nmightily and suddenly he avoided his horse and put his shield afore him,\nand then drew his sword, and bade the other knight alight and do battle\nwith him on foot. Then that knight descended from his horse lightly like\na valiant man, and put his shield afore him and drew his sword; and so\nthey came eagerly unto battle, and either gave other many great strokes,\ntracing and traversing, racing and foining, and hurtling together with\ntheir swords as it were wild boars. Thus were they fighting nigh an\nhour, for this Sir Mador was a strong knight, and mightily proved\nin many strong battles. But at the last this knight smote Sir Mador\ngrovelling upon the earth, and the knight stepped near him to have\npulled Sir Mador flatling upon the ground; and therewith suddenly Sir\nMador arose, and in his rising he smote that knight through the thick of\nthe thighs that the blood ran out fiercely. And when he felt himself so\nwounded, and saw his blood, he let him arise upon his feet. And then he\ngave him such a buffet upon the helm that he fell to the earth flatling,\nand therewith he strode to him to have pulled off his helm off his\nhead. And then Sir Mador prayed that knight to save his life, and so he\nyielded him as overcome, and released the queen of his quarrel. I will\nnot grant thee thy life, said that knight, only that thou freely release\nthe queen for ever, and that no mention be made upon Sir Patrise's tomb\nthat ever Queen Guenever consented to that treason. All this shall be\ndone, said Sir Mador, I clearly discharge my quarrel for ever.\n\nThen the knights parters of the lists took up Sir Mador, and led him to\nhis tent, and the other knight went straight to the stair-foot where sat\nKing Arthur; and by that time was the queen come to the king, and either\nkissed other heartily. And when the king saw that knight, he stooped\ndown to him, and thanked him, and in likewise did the queen; and the\nking prayed him to put off his helmet, and to repose him, and to take\na sop of wine. And then he put off his helm to drink, and then every\nknight knew him that it was Sir Launcelot du Lake. Anon as the king wist\nthat, he took the queen in his hand, and yode unto Sir Launcelot, and\nsaid: Sir, grant mercy of your great travail that ye have had this day\nfor me and for my queen. My lord, said Sir Launcelot, wit ye well I\nought of right ever to be in your quarrel, and in my lady the queen's\nquarrel, to do battle; for ye are the man that gave me the high order of\nknighthood, and that day my lady, your queen, did me great worship, and\nelse I had been shamed; for that same day ye made me knight, through my\nhastiness I lost my sword, and my lady, your queen, found it, and lapped\nit in her train, and gave me my sword when I had need thereto, and else\nhad I been shamed among all knights; and therefore, my lord Arthur, I\npromised her at that day ever to be her knight in right outher in wrong.\nGrant mercy, said the king, for this journey; and wit ye well, said the\nking, I shall acquit your goodness.\n\nAnd ever the queen beheld Sir Launcelot, and wept so tenderly that she\nsank almost to the ground for sorrow that he had done to her so great\ngoodness where she shewed him great unkindness. Then the knights of his\nblood drew unto him, and there either of them made great joy of other.\nAnd so came all the knights of the Table Round that were there at that\ntime, and welcomed him. And then Sir Mador was had to leech-craft, and\nSir Launcelot was healed of his wound. And then there was made great joy\nand mirths in that court.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. How the truth was known by the Maiden of the Lake, and of\ndivers other matters.\n\n\nAND so it befell that the damosel of the lake, her name was Nimue, the\nwhich wedded the good knight Sir Pelleas, and so she came to the court;\nfor ever she did great goodness unto King Arthur and to all his knights\nthrough her sorcery and enchantments. And so when she heard how the\nqueen was an-angered for the death of Sir Patrise, then she told it\nopenly that she was never guilty; and there she disclosed by whom it was\ndone, and named him, Sir Pinel; and for what cause he did it, there it\nwas openly disclosed; and so the queen was excused, and the knight\nPinel fled into his country. Then was it openly known that Sir Pinel\nenpoisoned the apples at the feast to that intent to have destroyed Sir\nGawaine, because Sir Gawaine and his brethren destroyed Sir Lamorak\nde Galis, to the which Sir Pinel was cousin unto. Then was Sir Patrise\nburied in the church of Westminster in a tomb, and thereupon was\nwritten: Here lieth Sir Patrise of Ireland, slain by Sir Pinel le\nSavage, that enpoisoned apples to have slain Sir Gawaine, and by\nmisfortune Sir Patrise ate one of those apples, and then suddenly he\nbrast. Also there was written upon the tomb that Queen Guenever was\nappealed of treason of the death of Sir Patrise, by Sir Mador de la\nPorte; and there was made mention how Sir Launcelot fought with him for\nQueen Guenever, and overcame him in plain battle. All this was written\nupon the tomb of Sir Patrise in excusing of the queen. And then Sir\nMador sued daily and long, to have the queen's good grace; and so by the\nmeans of Sir Launcelot he caused him to stand in the queen's good grace,\nand all was forgiven.\n\nThus it passed on till our Lady Day, Assumption. Within a fifteen days\nof that feast the king let cry a great jousts and a tournament that\nshould be at that day at Camelot, that is Winchester; and the king let\ncry that he and the King of Scots would joust against all that would\ncome against them. And when this cry was made, thither came many\nknights. So there came thither the King of Northgalis, and King Anguish\nof Ireland, and the King with the Hundred Knights, and Galahad, the haut\nprince, and the King of Northumberland, and many other noble dukes and\nearls of divers countries. So King Arthur made him ready to depart to\nthese jousts, and would have had the queen with him, but at that time\nshe would not, she said, for she was sick and might not ride at that\ntime. That me repenteth, said the king, for this seven year ye saw not\nsuch a noble fellowship together except at Whitsuntide when Galahad\ndeparted from the court. Truly, said the queen to the king, ye must hold\nme excused, I may not be there, and that me repenteth. And many deemed\nthe queen would not be there because of Sir Launcelot du Lake, for Sir\nLauncelot would not ride with the king, for he said that he was not\nwhole of the wound the which Sir Mador had given him; wherefore the king\nwas heavy and passing wroth. And so he departed toward Winchester with\nhis fellowship; and so by the way the king lodged in a town called\nAstolat, that is now in English called Guildford, and there the king lay\nin the castle.\n\nSo when the king was departed the queen called Sir Launcelot to her,\nand said thus: Sir Launcelot, ye are greatly to blame thus to hold you\nbehind my lord; what, trow ye, what will your enemies and mine say and\ndeem? nought else but, See how Sir Launcelot holdeth him ever behind\nthe king, and so doth the queen, for that they would have their pleasure\ntogether. And thus will they say, said the queen to Sir Launcelot, have\nye no doubt thereof.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. How Sir Launcelot rode to Astolat, and received a sleeve to\nwear upon his helm at the request of a maid.\n\n\nMADAM, said Sir Launcelot, I allow your wit, it is of late come since\nye were wise. And therefore, madam, at this time I will be ruled by your\ncounsel, and this night I will take my rest, and to-morrow by time I\nwill take my way toward Winchester. But wit you well, said Sir Launcelot\nto the queen, that at that jousts I will be against the king, and\nagainst all his fellowship. Ye may there do as ye list, said the queen,\nbut by my counsel ye shall not be against your king and your fellowship.\nFor therein be full many hard knights of your blood, as ye wot well\nenough, it needeth not to rehearse them. Madam, said Sir Launcelot,\nI pray you that ye be not displeased with me, for I will take the\nadventure that God will send me.\n\nAnd so upon the morn early Sir Launcelot heard mass and brake his fast,\nand so took his leave of the queen and departed. And then he rode so\nmuch until he came to Astolat, that is Guildford; and there it happed\nhim in the eventide he came to an old baron's place that hight Sir\nBernard of Astolat. And as Sir Launcelot entered into his lodging, King\nArthur espied him as he did walk in a garden beside the castle, how he\ntook his lodging, and knew him full well. It is well, said King Arthur\nunto the knights that were with him in that garden beside the castle, I\nhave now espied one knight that will play his play at the jousts to the\nwhich we be gone toward; I undertake he will do marvels. Who is that,\nwe pray you tell us? said many knights that were there at that time. Ye\nshall not wit for me, said the king, as at this time. And so the king\nsmiled, and went to his lodging.\n\nSo when Sir Launcelot was in his lodging, and unarmed him in his\nchamber, the old baron and hermit came to him making his reverence,\nand welcomed him in the best manner; but the old knight knew not Sir\nLauncelot. Fair sir, said Sir Launcelot to his host, I would pray you\nto lend me a shield that were not openly known, for mine is well known.\nSir, said his host, ye shall have your desire, for meseemeth ye be one\nof the likeliest knights of the world, and therefore I shall shew you\nfriendship. Sir, wit you well I have two sons that were but late made\nknights, and the eldest hight Sir Tirre, and he was hurt that same day\nhe was made knight, that he may not ride, and his shield ye shall have;\nfor that is not known I dare say but here, and in no place else. And my\nyoungest son hight Lavaine, and if it please you, he shall ride with\nyou unto that jousts; and he is of his age strong and wight, for much my\nheart giveth unto you that ye should be a noble knight, therefore I\npray you, tell me your name, said Sir Bernard. As for that, said Sir\nLauncelot, ye must hold me excused as at this time, and if God give me\ngrace to speed well at the jousts I shall come again and tell you. But\nI pray you, said Sir Launcelot, in any wise let me have your son, Sir\nLavaine, with me, and that I may have his brother's shield. All this\nshall be done, said Sir Bernard.\n\nThis old baron had a daughter that was called that time the Fair Maiden\nof Astolat. And ever she beheld Sir Launcelot wonderfully; and as the\nbook saith, she cast such a love unto Sir Launcelot that she could never\nwithdraw her love, wherefore she died, and her name was Elaine le Blank.\nSo thus as she came to and fro she was so hot in her love that she\nbesought Sir Launcelot to wear upon him at the jousts a token of hers.\nFair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, an if I grant you that, ye may say\nI do more for your love than ever I did for lady or damosel. Then he\nremembered him he would go to the jousts disguised. And because he had\nnever fore that time borne no manner of token of no damosel, then he\nbethought him that he would bear one of her, that none of his blood\nthereby might know him, and then he said: Fair maiden, I will grant you\nto wear a token of yours upon mine helmet, and therefore what it is,\nshew it me. Sir, she said, it is a red sleeve of mine, of scarlet,\nwell embroidered with great pearls: and so she brought it him. So\nSir Launcelot received it, and said: Never did I erst so much for no\ndamosel. And then Sir Launcelot betook the fair maiden his shield in\nkeeping, and prayed her to keep that until that he came again; and\nso that night he had merry rest and great cheer, for ever the damosel\nElaine was about Sir Launcelot all the while she might be suffered.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. How the tourney began at Winchester, and what knights were at\nthe jousts; and other things.\n\n\nSO upon a day, on the morn, King Arthur and all his knights departed,\nfor their king had tarried three days to abide his noble knights. And so\nwhen the king was ridden, Sir Launcelot and Sir Lavaine made them ready\nto ride, and either of them had white shields, and the red sleeve\nSir Launcelot let carry with him. And so they took their leave at Sir\nBernard, the old baron, and at his daughter, the Fair Maiden of Astolat.\nAnd then they rode so long till that they came to Camelot, that time\ncalled Winchester; and there was great press of kings, dukes earls,\nand barons, and many noble knights. But there Sir Launcelot was lodged\nprivily by the means of Sir Lavaine with a rich burgess, that no man in\nthat town was ware what they were. And so they reposed them there till\nour Lady Day, Assumption, as the great feast should be. So then trumpets\nblew unto the field, and King Arthur was set on high upon a scaffold to\nbehold who did best. But as the French book saith, the king would not\nsuffer Sir Gawaine to go from him, for never had Sir Gawaine the better\nan Sir Launcelot were in the field; and many times was Sir Gawaine\nrebuked when Launcelot came into any jousts disguised.\n\nThen some of the kings, as King Anguish of Ireland and the King of\nScots, were that time turned upon the side of King Arthur. And then\non the other party was the King of Northgalis, and the King with the\nHundred Knights, and the King of Northumberland, and Sir Galahad, the\nhaut prince. But these three kings and this duke were passing weak to\nhold against King Arthur's party, for with him were the noblest knights\nof the world. So then they withdrew them either party from other, and\nevery man made him ready in his best manner to do what he might.\n\nThen Sir Launcelot made him ready, and put the red sleeve upon his head,\nand fastened it fast; and so Sir Launcelot and Sir Lavaine departed out\nof Winchester privily, and rode until a little leaved wood behind the\nparty that held against King Arthur's party, and there they held them\nstill till the parties smote together. And then came in the King of\nScots and the King of Ireland on Arthur's party, and against them came\nthe King of Northumberland, and the King with the Hundred Knights smote\ndown the King of Northumberland, and the King with the Hundred Knights\nsmote down King Anguish of Ireland. Then Sir Palomides that was on\nArthur's party encountered with Sir Galahad, and either of them smote\ndown other, and either party halp their lords on horseback again. So\nthere began a strong assail upon both parties. And then came in Sir\nBrandiles, Sir Sagramore le Desirous, Sir Dodinas le Savage, Sir Kay\nle Seneschal, Sir Griflet le Fise de Dieu, Sir Mordred, Sir Meliot\nde Logris, Sir Ozanna le Cure Hardy, Sir Safere, Sir Epinogris, Sir\nGalleron of Galway. All these fifteen knights were knights of the Table\nRound. So these with more other came in together, and beat aback the\nKing of Northumberland and the King of Northgalis. When Sir Launcelot\nsaw this, as he hoved in a little leaved wood, then he said unto Sir\nLavaine: See yonder is a company of good knights, and they hold them\ntogether as boars that were chafed with dogs. That is truth, said Sir\nLavaine.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. How Sir Launcelot and Sir Lavaine entered in the field\nagainst them of King Arthur's court, and how Launcelot was hurt.\n\n\nNOW, said Sir Launcelot, an ye will help me a little, ye shall see\nyonder fellowship that chaseth now these men in our side, that they\nshall go as fast backward as they went forward. Sir, spare not, said Sir\nLavaine, for I shall do what I may. Then Sir Launcelot and Sir Lavaine\ncame in at the thickest of the press, and there Sir Launcelot smote down\nSir Brandiles, Sir Sagramore, Sir Dodinas, Sir Kay, Sir Griflet, and\nall this he did with one spear; and Sir Lavaine smote down Sir Lucan le\nButler and Sir Bedevere. And then Sir Launcelot gat another spear, and\nthere he smote down Sir Agravaine, Sir Gaheris, and Sir Mordred, and Sir\nMeliot de Logris; and Sir Lavaine smote Ozanna le Cure Hardy. And then\nSir Launcelot drew his sword, and there he smote on the right hand\nand on the left hand, and by great force he unhorsed Sir Safere, Sir\nEpinogris, and Sir Galleron; and then the knights of the Table Round\nwithdrew them aback, after they had gotten their horses as well as they\nmight. O mercy Jesu, said Sir Gawaine, what knight is yonder that doth\nso marvellous deeds of arms in that field? I wot well what he is, said\nKing Arthur, but as at this time I will not name him. Sir, said Sir\nGawaine, I would say it were Sir Launcelot by his riding and his buffets\nthat I see him deal, but ever meseemeth it should not be he, for that he\nbeareth the red sleeve upon his head; for I wist him never bear token\nat no jousts, of lady nor gentlewoman. Let him be, said King Arthur, he\nwill be better known, and do more, or ever he depart.\n\nThen the party that was against King Arthur were well comforted, and\nthen they held them together that beforehand were sore rebuked. Then Sir\nBors, Sir Ector de Maris, and Sir Lionel called unto them the knights\nof their blood, as Sir Blamore de Ganis, Sir Bleoberis, Sir Aliduke, Sir\nGalihud, Sir Galihodin, Sir Bellangere le Beuse. So these nine knights\nof Sir Launcelot's kin thrust in mightily, for they were all noble\nknights; and they, of great hate and despite that they had unto him,\nthought to rebuke that noble knight Sir Launcelot, and Sir Lavaine, for\nthey knew them not; and so they came hurling together, and smote down\nmany knights of Northgalis and of Northumberland. And when Sir Launcelot\nsaw them fare so, he gat a spear in his hand; and there encountered with\nhim all at once Sir Bors, Sir Ector, and Sir Lionel, and all they three\nsmote him at once with their spears. And with force of themself they\nsmote Sir Launcelot's horse to the earth; and by misfortune Sir Bors\nsmote Sir Launcelot through the shield into the side, and the spear\nbrake, and the head left still in his side.\n\nWhen Sir Lavaine saw his master lie on the ground, he ran to the King of\nScots and smote him to the earth; and by great force he took his horse,\nand brought him to Sir Launcelot, and maugre of them all he made him to\nmount upon that horse. And then Launcelot gat a spear in his hand, and\nthere he smote Sir Bors, horse and man, to the earth. In the same wise\nhe served Sir Ector and Sir Lionel; and Sir Lavaine smote down Sir\nBlamore de Ganis. And then Sir Launcelot drew his sword, for he felt\nhimself so sore y-hurt that he weened there to have had his death. And\nthen he smote Sir Bleoberis such a buffet on the helm that he fell down\nto the earth in a swoon. And in the same wise he served Sir Aliduke and\nSir Galihud. And Sir Lavaine smote down Sir Bellangere, that was the son\nof Alisander le Orphelin.\n\nAnd by this was Sir Bors horsed, and then he came with Sir Ector and\nSir Lionel, and all they three smote with swords upon Sir Launcelot's\nhelmet. And when he felt their buffets and his wound, the which was so\ngrievous, then he thought to do what he might while he might endure.\nAnd then he gave Sir Bors such a buffet that he made him bow his head\npassing low; and therewithal he raced off his helm, and might have slain\nhim; and so pulled him down, and in the same wise he served Sir Ector\nand Sir Lionel. For as the book saith he might have slain them, but when\nhe saw their visages his heart might not serve him thereto, but left\nthem there. And then afterward he hurled into the thickest press of them\nall, and did there the marvelloust deeds of arms that ever man saw or\nheard speak of, and ever Sir Lavaine, the good knight, with him. And\nthere Sir Launcelot with his sword smote down and pulled down, as the\nFrench book maketh mention, mo than thirty knights, and the most part\nwere of the Table Round; and Sir Lavaine did full well that day, for he\nsmote down ten knights of the Table Round.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. How Sir Launcelot and Sir Lavaine departed out of the\nfield, and in what jeopardy Launcelot was.\n\n\nMERCY Jesu, said Sir Gawaine to Arthur, I marvel what knight that he\nis with the red sleeve. Sir, said King Arthur, he will be known or he\ndepart. And then the king blew unto lodging, and the prize was given by\nheralds unto the knight with the white shield that bare the red sleeve.\nThen came the King with the Hundred Knights, the King of Northgalis, and\nthe King of Northumberland, and Sir Galahad, the haut prince, and said\nunto Sir Launcelot: Fair knight, God thee bless, for much have ye done\nthis day for us, therefore we pray you that ye will come with us that\nye may receive the honour and the prize as ye have worshipfully deserved\nit. My fair lords, said Sir Launcelot, wit you well if I have deserved\nthanks I have sore bought it, and that me repenteth, for I am like never\nto escape with my life; therefore, fair lords, I pray you that ye will\nsuffer me to depart where me liketh, for I am sore hurt. I take none\nforce of none honour, for I had liefer to repose me than to be lord of\nall the world. And therewithal he groaned piteously, and rode a great\nwallop away-ward from them until he came under a wood's side.\n\nAnd when he saw that he was from the field nigh a mile, that he was sure\nhe might not be seen, then he said with an high voice: O gentle knight,\nSir Lavaine, help me that this truncheon were out of my side, for it\nsticketh so sore that it nigh slayeth me. O mine own lord, said Sir\nLavaine, I would fain do that might please you, but I dread me sore an I\npull out the truncheon that ye shall be in peril of death. I charge\nyou, said Sir Launcelot, as ye love me, draw it out. And therewithal he\ndescended from his horse, and right so did Sir Lavaine; and forthwithal\nSir Lavaine drew the truncheon out of his side, and he gave a great\nshriek and a marvellous grisly groan, and the blood brast out nigh a\npint at once, that at the last he sank down upon his buttocks, and so\nswooned pale and deadly. Alas, said Sir Lavaine, what shall I do? And\nthen he turned Sir Launcelot into the wind, but so he lay there nigh\nhalf an hour as he had been dead.\n\nAnd so at the last Sir Launcelot cast up his eyes, and said: O Lavaine,\nhelp me that I were on my horse, for here is fast by within this two\nmile a gentle hermit that sometime was a full noble knight and a great\nlord of possessions. And for great goodness he hath taken him to\nwilful poverty, and forsaken many lands, and his name is Sir Baudwin of\nBrittany, and he is a full noble surgeon and a good leech. Now let see,\nhelp me up that I were there, for ever my heart giveth me that I shall\nnever die of my cousin-germain's hands. And then with great pain Sir\nLavaine halp him upon his horse. And then they rode a great wallop\ntogether, and ever Sir Launcelot bled that it ran down to the earth; and\nso by fortune they came to that hermitage the which was under a wood,\nand a great cliff on the other side, and a fair water running under it.\nAnd then Sir Lavaine beat on the gate with the butt of his spear, and\ncried fast: Let in for Jesu's sake.\n\nAnd there came a fair child to them, and asked them what they would.\nFair son, said Sir Lavaine, go and pray thy lord, the hermit, for God's\nsake to let in here a knight that is full sore wounded; and this day\ntell thy lord I saw him do more deeds of arms than ever I heard say\nthat any man did. So the child went in lightly, and then he brought the\nhermit, the which was a passing good man. When Sir Lavaine saw him\nhe prayed him for God's sake of succour. What knight is he? said the\nhermit. Is he of the house of King Arthur, or not? I wot not, said Sir\nLavaine, what is he, nor what is his name, but well I wot I saw him do\nmarvellously this day as of deeds of arms. On whose party was he? said\nthe hermit. Sir, said Sir Lavaine, he was this day against King Arthur,\nand there he won the prize of all the knights of the Round Table. I have\nseen the day, said the hermit, I would have loved him the worse because\nhe was against my lord, King Arthur, for sometime I was one of the\nfellowship of the Round Table, but I thank God now I am otherwise\ndisposed. But where is he? let me see him. Then Sir Lavaine brought the\nhermit to him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. How Launcelot was brought to an hermit for to be healed of\nhis wound, and of other matters.\n\n\nAND when the hermit beheld him, as he sat leaning upon his saddle-bow\never bleeding piteously, and ever the knight-hermit thought that he\nshould know him, but he could not bring him to knowledge because he was\nso pale for bleeding. What knight are ye, said the hermit, and where\nwere ye born? My fair lord, said Sir Launcelot, I am a stranger and a\nknight adventurous, that laboureth throughout many realms for to win\nworship. Then the hermit advised him better, and saw by a wound on his\ncheek that he was Sir Launcelot. Alas, said the hermit, mine own lord\nwhy lain you your name from me? Forsooth I ought to know you of right,\nfor ye are the most noblest knight of the world, for well I know you\nfor Sir Launcelot. Sir, said he, sith ye know me, help me an ye may, for\nGod's sake, for I would be out of this pain at once, either to death or\nto life. Have ye no doubt, said the hermit, ye shall live and fare right\nwell. And so the hermit called to him two of his servants, and so he and\nhis servants bare him into the hermitage, and lightly unarmed him, and\nlaid him in his bed. And then anon the hermit staunched his blood, and\nmade him to drink good wine, so that Sir Launcelot was well refreshed\nand knew himself; for in those days it was not the guise of hermits as\nis nowadays, for there were none hermits in those days but that they\nhad been men of worship and of prowess; and those hermits held great\nhousehold, and refreshed people that were in distress.\n\nNow turn we unto King Arthur, and leave we Sir Launcelot in the\nhermitage. So when the kings were come together on both parties, and the\ngreat feast should be holden, King Arthur asked the King of Northgalis\nand their fellowship, where was that knight that bare the red sleeve:\nBring him afore me that he may have his laud, and honour, and the prize,\nas it is right. Then spake Sir Galahad, the haut prince, and the King\nwith the Hundred Knights: We suppose that knight is mischieved, and that\nhe is never like to see you nor none of us all, and that is the greatest\npity that ever we wist of any knight. Alas, said Arthur, how may this\nbe, is he so hurt? What is his name? said King Arthur. Truly, said\nthey all, we know not his name, nor from whence he came, nor whither he\nwould. Alas, said the king, this be to me the worst tidings that came\nto me this seven year, for I would not for all the lands I wield to know\nand wit it were so that that noble knight were slain. Know ye him? said\nthey all. As for that, said Arthur, whether I know him or know him not,\nye shall not know for me what man he is, but Almighty Jesu send me good\ntidings of him. And so said they all. By my head, said Sir Gawaine, if\nit so be that the good knight be so sore hurt, it is great damage and\npity to all this land, for he is one of the noblest knights that ever I\nsaw in a field handle a spear or a sword; and if he may be found I shall\nfind him, for I am sure he nis not far from this town. Bear you well,\nsaid King Arthur, an ye may find him, unless that he be in such a plight\nthat he may not wield himself. Jesu defend, said Sir Gawaine, but wit I\nshall what he is, an I may find him.\n\nRight so Sir Gawaine took a squire with him upon hackneys, and rode all\nabout Camelot within six or seven mile, but so he came again and could\nhear no word of him. Then within two days King Arthur and all the\nfellowship returned unto London again. And so as they rode by the way it\nhapped Sir Gawaine at Astolat to lodge with Sir Bernard thereas was Sir\nLauncelot lodged. And so as Sir Gawaine was in his chamber to repose him\nSir Bernard, the old baron, came unto him, and his daughter Elaine,\nto cheer him and to ask him what tidings, and who did best at that\ntournament of Winchester. So God me help, said Sir Gawaine, there were\ntwo knights that bare two white shields, but the one of them bare a red\nsleeve upon his head, and certainly he was one of the best knights that\never I saw joust in field. For I dare say, said Sir Gawaine, that one\nknight with the red sleeve smote down forty knights of the Table Round,\nand his fellow did right well and worshipfully. Now blessed be God, said\nthe Fair Maiden of Astolat, that that knight sped so well, for he is\nthe man in the world that I first loved, and truly he shall be last that\never I shall love. Now, fair maid, said Sir Gawaine, is that good knight\nyour love? Certainly sir, said she, wit ye well he is my love. Then know\nye his name? said Sir Gawaine. Nay truly, said the damosel, I know\nnot his name nor from whence he cometh, but to say that I love him, I\npromise you and God that I love him. How had ye knowledge of him first?\nsaid Sir Gawaine.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. How Sir Gawaine was lodged with the lord of Astolat, and\nthere had knowledge that it was Sir Launcelot that bare the red sleeve.\n\n\nTHEN she told him as ye have heard to-fore, and how her father betook\nhim her brother to do him service, and how her father lent him her\nbrother's, Sir Tirre's, shield: And here with me he left his own shield.\nFor what cause did he so? said Sir Gawaine. For this cause, said the\ndamosel, for his shield was too well known among many noble knights.\nAh fair damosel, said Sir Gawaine, please it you let me have a sight of\nthat shield. Sir, said she, it is in my chamber, covered with a case,\nand if ye will come with me ye shall see it. Not so, said Sir Bernard\ntill his daughter, let send for it.\n\nSo when the shield was come, Sir Gawaine took off the case, and when he\nbeheld that shield he knew anon that it was Sir Launcelot's shield,\nand his own arms. Ah Jesu mercy, said Sir Gawaine, now is my heart more\nheavier than ever it was to-fore. Why? said Elaine. For I have great\ncause, said Sir Gawaine. Is that knight that oweth this shield your\nlove? Yea truly, said she, my love he is, God would I were his love. So\nGod me speed, said Sir Gawaine, fair damosel ye have right, for an he be\nyour love ye love the most honourable knight of the world, and the man\nof most worship. So me thought ever, said the damosel, for never or that\ntime, for no knight that ever I saw, loved I never none erst. God grant,\nsaid Sir Gawaine, that either of you may rejoice other, but that is in\na great adventure. But truly, said Sir Gawaine unto the damosel, ye may\nsay ye have a fair grace, for why I have known that noble knight this\nfour-and-twenty year, and never or that day, I nor none other knight, I\ndare make good, saw nor heard say that ever he bare token or sign of no\nlady, gentlewoman, ne maiden, at no jousts nor tournament. And therefore\nfair maiden, said Sir Gawaine, ye are much beholden to him to give him\nthanks. But I dread me, said Sir Gawaine, that ye shall never see him\nin this world, and that is great pity that ever was of earthly knight.\nAlas, said she, how may this be, is he slain? I say not so, said Sir\nGawaine, but wit ye well he is grievously wounded, by all manner of\nsigns, and by men's sight more likelier to be dead than to be alive; and\nwit ye well he is the noble knight, Sir Launcelot, for by this shield\nI know him. Alas, said the Fair Maiden of Astolat, how may this be, and\nwhat was his hurt? Truly, said Sir Gawaine, the man in the world that\nloved him best hurt him so; and I dare say, said Sir Gawaine, an that\nknight that hurt him knew the very certainty that he had hurt Sir\nLauncelot, it would be the most sorrow that ever came to his heart.\n\nNow fair father, said then Elaine, I require you give me leave to ride\nand to seek him, or else I wot well I shall go out of my mind, for I\nshall never stint till that I find him and my brother, Sir Lavaine. Do\nas it liketh you, said her father, for me sore repenteth of the hurt\nof that noble knight. Right so the maid made her ready, and before Sir\nGawaine, making great dole.\n\nThen on the morn Sir Gawaine came to King Arthur, and told him how he\nhad found Sir Launcelot's shield in the keeping of the Fair Maiden of\nAstolat. All that knew I aforehand, said King Arthur, and that caused\nme I would not suffer you to have ado at the great jousts, for I espied,\nsaid King Arthur, when he came in till his lodging full late in the\nevening in Astolat. But marvel have I, said Arthur, that ever he would\nbear any sign of any damosel, for or now I never heard say nor knew\nthat ever he bare any token of none earthly woman. By my head, said Sir\nGawaine, the Fair Maiden of Astolat loveth him marvellously well; what\nit meaneth I cannot say, and she is ridden after to seek him. So the\nking and all came to London, and there Sir Gawaine openly disclosed to\nall the court that it was Sir Launcelot that jousted best.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. Of the sorrow that Sir Bors had for the hurt of Launcelot;\nand of the anger that the queen had because Launcelot bare the sleeve.\n\n\nAND when Sir Bors heard that, wit ye well he was an heavy man, and so\nwere all his kinsmen. But when Queen Guenever wist that Sir Launcelot\nbare the red sleeve of the Fair Maiden of Astolat she was nigh out of\nher mind for wrath. And then she sent for Sir Bors de Ganis in all the\nhaste that might be. So when Sir Bors was come to-fore the queen, then\nshe said: Ah Sir Bors, have ye heard say how falsely Sir Launcelot hath\nbetrayed me? Alas madam, said Sir Bors, I am afeard he hath betrayed\nhimself and us all. No force, said the queen, though he be destroyed,\nfor he is a false traitor-knight. Madam, said Sir Bors, I pray you say\nye not so, for wit you well I may not hear such language of him. Why\nSir Bors, said she, should I not call him traitor when he bare the red\nsleeve upon his head at Winchester, at the great jousts? Madam, said Sir\nBors, that sleeve-bearing repenteth me sore, but I dare say he did it to\nnone evil intent, but for this cause he bare the red sleeve that none\nof his blood should know him. For or then we, nor none of us all, never\nknew that ever he bare token or sign of maid, lady, ne gentlewoman.\nFie on him, said the queen, yet for all his pride and bobaunce there ye\nproved yourself his better. Nay madam, say ye never more so, for he beat\nme and my fellows, and might have slain us an he had would. Fie on him,\nsaid the queen, for I heard Sir Gawaine say before my lord Arthur that\nit were marvel to tell the great love that is between the Fair Maiden of\nAstolat and him. Madam, said Sir Bors, I may not warn Sir Gawaine to say\nwhat it pleased him; but I dare say, as for my lord, Sir Launcelot,\nthat he loveth no lady, gentlewoman, nor maid, but all he loveth in like\nmuch. And therefore madam, said Sir Bors, ye may say what ye will, but\nwit ye well I will haste me to seek him, and find him wheresomever he\nbe, and God send me good tidings of him. And so leave we them there, and\nspeak we of Sir Launcelot that lay in great peril.\n\nSo as fair Elaine came to Winchester she sought there all about, and by\nfortune Sir Lavaine was ridden to play him, to enchafe his horse. And\nanon as Elaine saw him she knew him, and then she cried aloud until\nhim. And when he heard her anon he came to her, and then she asked her\nbrother how did my lord, Sir Launcelot. Who told you, sister, that my\nlord's name was Sir Launcelot? Then she told him how Sir Gawaine by\nhis shield knew him. So they rode together till that they came to the\nhermitage, and anon she alighted.\n\nSo Sir Lavaine brought her in to Sir Launcelot; and when she saw him lie\nso sick and pale in his bed she might not speak, but suddenly she fell\nto the earth down suddenly in a swoon, and there she lay a great\nwhile. And when she was relieved, she shrieked and said: My lord, Sir\nLauncelot, alas why be ye in this plight? and then she swooned again.\nAnd then Sir Launcelot prayed Sir Lavaine to take her up: And bring her\nto me. And when she came to herself Sir Launcelot kissed her, and said:\nFair maiden, why fare ye thus? ye put me to pain; wherefore make ye no\nmore such cheer, for an ye be come to comfort me ye be right welcome;\nand of this little hurt that I have I shall be right hastily whole by\nthe grace of God. But I marvel, said Sir Launcelot, who told you my\nname? Then the fair maiden told him all how Sir Gawaine was lodged with\nher father: And there by your shield he discovered your name. Alas, said\nSir Launcelot, that me repenteth that my name is known, for I am sure it\nwill turn unto anger. And then Sir Launcelot compassed in his mind that\nSir Gawaine would tell Queen Guenever how he bare the red sleeve, and\nfor whom; that he wist well would turn into great anger.\n\nSo this maiden Elaine never went from Sir Launcelot, but watched him day\nand night, and did such attendance to him, that the French book saith\nthere was never woman did more kindlier for man than she. Then Sir\nLauncelot prayed Sir Lavaine to make aspies in Winchester for Sir Bors\nif he came there, and told him by what tokens he should know him, by a\nwound in his forehead. For well I am sure, said Sir Launcelot, that Sir\nBors will seek me, for he is the same good knight that hurt me.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. How Sir Bors sought Launcelot and found him in the\nhermitage, and of the lamentation between them.\n\n\nNOW turn we unto Sir Bors de Ganis that came unto Winchester to seek\nafter his cousin Sir Launcelot. And so when he came to Winchester, anon\nthere were men that Sir Lavaine had made to lie in a watch for such\na man, and anon Sir Lavaine had warning; and then Sir Lavaine came to\nWinchester and found Sir Bors, and there he told him what he was, and\nwith whom he was, and what was his name. Now fair knight, said Sir Bors,\nI require you that ye will bring me to my lord, Sir Launcelot. Sir, said\nSir Lavaine, take your horse, and within this hour ye shall see him. And\nso they departed, and came to the hermitage.\n\nAnd when Sir Bors saw Sir Launcelot lie in his bed pale and discoloured,\nanon Sir Bors lost his countenance, and for kindness and pity he might\nnot speak, but wept tenderly a great while. And then when he might speak\nhe said thus: O my lord, Sir Launcelot, God you bless, and send\nyou hasty recover; and full heavy am I of my misfortune and of mine\nunhappiness, for now I may call myself unhappy. And I dread me that God\nis greatly displeased with me, that he would suffer me to have such a\nshame for to hurt you that are all our leader, and all our worship; and\ntherefore I call myself unhappy. Alas that ever such a caitiff-knight as\nI am should have power by unhappiness to hurt the most noblest knight of\nthe world. Where I so shamefully set upon you and overcharged you, and\nwhere ye might have slain me, ye saved me; and so did not I, for I and\nyour blood did to you our utterance. I marvel, said Sir Bors, that my\nheart or my blood would serve me, wherefore my lord, Sir Launcelot, I\nask your mercy. Fair cousin, said Sir Launcelot, ye be right welcome;\nand wit ye well, overmuch ye say for to please me, the which pleaseth\nme not, for why I have the same I sought; for I would with pride have\novercome you all, and there in my pride I was near slain, and that was\nin mine own default, for I might have given you warning of my being\nthere. And then had I had no hurt, for it is an old said saw, there\nis hard battle thereas kin and friends do battle either against other,\nthere may be no mercy but mortal war. Therefore, fair cousin, said Sir\nLauncelot, let this speech overpass, and all shall be welcome that\nGod sendeth; and let us leave off this matter and let us speak of some\nrejoicing, for this that is done may not be undone; and let us find a\nremedy how soon that I may be whole.\n\nThen Sir Bors leaned upon his bedside, and told Sir Launcelot how the\nqueen was passing wroth with him, because he wore the red sleeve at the\ngreat jousts; and there Sir Bors told him all how Sir Gawaine discovered\nit: By your shield that ye left with the Fair Maiden of Astolat. Then is\nthe queen wroth, said Sir Launcelot and therefore am I right heavy,\nfor I deserved no wrath, for all that I did was because I would not be\nknown. Right so excused I you, said Sir Bors, but all was in vain, for\nshe said more largelier to me than I to you now. But is this she, said\nSir Bors, that is so busy about you, that men call the Fair Maiden of\nAstolat? She it is, said Sir Launcelot, that by no means I cannot put\nher from me. Why should ye put her from you? said Sir Bors, she is a\npassing fair damosel, and a well beseen, and well taught; and God would,\nfair cousin, said Sir Bors, that ye could love her, but as to that I may\nnot, nor I dare not, counsel you. But I see well, said Sir Bors, by her\ndiligence about you that she loveth you entirely. That me repenteth,\nsaid Sir Launcelot. Sir, said Sir Bors, she is not the first that hath\nlost her pain upon you, and that is the more pity: and so they talked of\nmany more things. And so within three days or four Sir Launcelot was big\nand strong again.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. How Sir Launcelot armed him to assay if he might bear\narms, and how his wounds brast out again.\n\n\nTHEN Sir Bors told Sir Launcelot how there was sworn a great tournament\nand jousts betwixt King Arthur and the King of Northgalis, that should\nbe upon All Hallowmass Day, beside Winchester. Is that truth? said Sir\nLauncelot; then shall ye abide with me still a little while until that\nI be whole, for I feel myself right big and strong. Blessed be God,\nsaid Sir Bors. Then were they there nigh a month together, and ever\nthis maiden Elaine did ever her diligent labour night and day unto Sir\nLauncelot, that there was never child nor wife more meeker to her father\nand husband than was that Fair Maiden of Astolat; wherefore Sir Bors was\ngreatly pleased with her.\n\nSo upon a day, by the assent of Sir Launcelot, Sir Bors, and Sir\nLavaine, they made the hermit to seek in woods for divers herbs, and\nso Sir Launcelot made fair Elaine to gather herbs for him to make him a\nbain. In the meanwhile Sir Launcelot made him to arm him at all pieces;\nand there he thought to assay his armour and his spear, for his hurt or\nnot. And so when he was upon his horse he stirred him fiercely, and the\nhorse was passing lusty and fresh because he was not laboured a month\nafore. And then Sir Launcelot couched that spear in the rest. That\ncourser leapt mightily when he felt the spurs; and he that was upon him,\nthe which was the noblest horse of the world, strained him mightily\nand stably, and kept still the spear in the rest; and therewith Sir\nLauncelot strained himself so straitly, with so great force, to get\nthe horse forward, that the button of his wound brast both within and\nwithout; and therewithal the blood came out so fiercely that he felt\nhimself so feeble that he might not sit upon his horse. And then Sir\nLauncelot cried unto Sir Bors: Ah, Sir Bors and Sir Lavaine, help, for\nI am come to mine end. And therewith he fell down on the one side to the\nearth like a dead corpse. And then Sir Bors and Sir Lavaine came to him\nwith sorrow-making out of measure. And so by fortune the maiden Elaine\nheard their mourning, and then she came thither; and when she found Sir\nLauncelot there armed in that place she cried and wept as she had been\nwood; and then she kissed him, and did what she might to awake him.\nAnd then she rebuked her brother and Sir Bors, and called them false\ntraitors, why they would take him out of his bed; there she cried, and\nsaid she would appeal them of his death.\n\nWith this came the holy hermit, Sir Baudwin of Brittany, and when he\nfound Sir Launcelot in that plight he said but little, but wit ye well\nhe was wroth; and then he bade them: Let us have him in. And so they all\nbare him unto the hermitage, and unarmed him, and laid him in his bed;\nand evermore his wound bled piteously, but he stirred no limb of him.\nThen the knight-hermit put a thing in his nose and a little deal of\nwater in his mouth. And then Sir Launcelot waked of his swoon, and then\nthe hermit staunched his bleeding. And when he might speak he asked\nSir Launcelot why he put his life in jeopardy. Sir, said Sir Launcelot,\nbecause I weened I had been strong, and also Sir Bors told me that there\nshould be at All Hallowmass a great jousts betwixt King Arthur and the\nKing of Northgalis, and therefore I thought to assay it myself whether\nI might be there or not. Ah, Sir Launcelot, said the hermit, your heart\nand your courage will never be done until your last day, but ye shall do\nnow by my counsel Let Sir Bors depart from you, and let him do at that\ntournament what he may: And by the grace of God, said the knight-hermit,\nby that the tournament be done and ye come hither again, Sir Launcelot\nshall be as whole as ye, so that he will be governed by me.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. How Sir Bors returned and told tidings of Sir Launcelot;\nand of the tourney, and to whom the prize was given.\n\n\nTHEN Sir Bors made him ready to depart from Sir Launcelot; and then Sir\nLauncelot said: Fair cousin, Sir Bors, recommend me unto all them unto\nwhom me ought to recommend me unto. And I pray you, enforce yourself at\nthat jousts that ye may be best, for my love; and here shall I abide\nyou at the mercy of God till ye come again. And so Sir Bors departed\nand came to the court of King Arthur, and told them in what place he had\nleft Sir Launcelot. That me repenteth, said the king, but since he shall\nhave his life we all may thank God. And there Sir Bors told the queen in\nwhat jeopardy Sir Launcelot was when he would assay his horse. And all\nthat he did, madam, was for the love of you, because he would have been\nat this tournament. Fie on him, recreant knight, said the queen, for wit\nye well I am right sorry an he shall have his life. His life shall he\nhave, said Sir Bors, and who that would otherwise, except you, madam, we\nthat be of his blood should help to short their lives. But madam, said\nSir Bors, ye have been oft-times displeased with my lord, Sir Launcelot,\nbut at all times at the end ye find him a true knight: and so he\ndeparted.\n\nAnd then every knight of the Round Table that were there at that time\npresent made them ready to be at that jousts at All Hallowmass, and\nthither drew many knights of divers countries. And as All Hallowmass\ndrew near, thither came the King of Northgalis, and the King with the\nHundred Knights, and Sir Galahad, the haut prince, of Surluse, and\nthither came King Anguish of Ireland, and the King of Scots. So these\nthree kings came on King Arthur's party. And so that day Sir Gawaine did\ngreat deeds of arms, and began first. And the heralds numbered that Sir\nGawaine smote down twenty knights. Then Sir Bors de Ganis came in the\nsame time, and he was numbered that he smote down twenty knights; and\ntherefore the prize was given betwixt them both, for they began first\nand longest endured. Also Sir Gareth, as the book saith, did that day\ngreat deeds of arms, for he smote down and pulled down thirty knights.\nBut when he had done these deeds he tarried not but so departed, and\ntherefore he lost his prize. And Sir Palomides did great deeds of arms\nthat day, for he smote down twenty knights, but he departed suddenly,\nand men deemed Sir Gareth and he rode together to some manner\nadventures.\n\nSo when this tournament was done Sir Bors departed and rode till he came\nto Sir Launcelot, his cousin; and then he found him walking on his\nfeet, and there either made great joy of other; and so Sir Bors told Sir\nLauncelot of all the Jousts like as ye have heard. I marvel, said Sir\nLauncelot, that Sir Gareth, when he had done such deeds of arms, that he\nwould not tarry. Thereof we marvelled all, said Sir Bors, for but if it\nwere you, or Sir Tristram, or Sir Lamorak de Galis, I saw never knight\nbear down so many in so little a while as did Sir Gareth: and anon he\nwas gone we wist not where. By my head, said Sir Launcelot, he is a\nnoble knight, and a mighty man and well breathed; and if he were well\nassayed, said Sir Launcelot I would deem he were good enough for any\nknight that beareth the life; and he is a gentle knight, courteous,\ntrue, and bounteous, meek, and mild, and in him is no manner of mal\nengin, but plain, faithful, and true.\n\nSo then they made them ready to depart from the hermit. And so upon a\nmorn they took their horses and Elaine le Blank with them; and when they\ncame to Astolat there were they well lodged, and had great cheer of Sir\nBernard, the old baron, and of Sir Tirre, his son. And so upon the morn\nwhen Sir Launcelot should depart, fair Elaine brought her father with\nher, and Sir Lavaine, and Sir Tirre, and thus she said:\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. Of the great lamentation of the Fair Maid of Astolat when\nLauncelot should depart, and how she died for his love.\n\n\nMY lord, Sir Launcelot, now I see ye will depart; now fair knight and\ncourteous knight, have mercy upon me, and suffer me not to die for thy\nlove. What would ye that I did? said Sir Launcelot. I would have you to\nmy husband, said Elaine. Fair damosel, I thank you, said Sir Launcelot,\nbut truly, said he, I cast me never to be wedded man. Then, fair knight,\nsaid she, will ye be my paramour? Jesu defend me, said Sir Launcelot,\nfor then I rewarded your father and your brother full evil for their\ngreat goodness. Alas, said she, then must I die for your love. Ye shall\nnot so, said Sir Launcelot, for wit ye well, fair maiden, I might have\nbeen married an I had would, but I never applied me to be married yet;\nbut because, fair damosel, that ye love me as ye say ye do, I will for\nyour good will and kindness show you some goodness, and that is this,\nthat wheresomever ye will beset your heart upon some good knight that\nwill wed you, I shall give you together a thousand pound yearly to\nyou and to your heirs; thus much will I give you, fair madam, for your\nkindness, and always while I live to be your own knight. Of all this,\nsaid the maiden, I will none, for but if ye will wed me, or else be my\nparamour at the least, wit you well, Sir Launcelot, my good days are\ndone. Fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, of these two things ye must\npardon me.\n\nThen she shrieked shrilly, and fell down in a swoon; and then women bare\nher into her chamber, and there she made over much sorrow; and then Sir\nLauncelot would depart, and there he asked Sir Lavaine what he would do.\nWhat should I do, said Sir Lavaine, but follow you, but if ye drive me\nfrom you, or command me to go from you. Then came Sir Bernard to Sir\nLauncelot and said to him: I cannot see but that my daughter Elaine will\ndie for your sake. I may not do withal, said Sir Launcelot, for that me\nsore repenteth, for I report me to yourself, that my proffer is fair;\nand me repenteth, said Sir Launcelot, that she loveth me as she doth; I\nwas never the causer of it, for I report me to your son I early ne\nlate proffered her bount\u00e9 nor fair behests; and as for me, said Sir\nLauncelot, I dare do all that a knight should do that she is a clean\nmaiden for me, both for deed and for will. And I am right heavy of\nher distress, for she is a full fair maiden, good and gentle, and well\ntaught. Father, said Sir Lavaine, I dare make good she is a clean maiden\nas for my lord Sir Launcelot; but she doth as I do, for sithen I first\nsaw my lord Sir Launcelot, I could never depart from him, nor nought I\nwill an I may follow him.\n\nThen Sir Launcelot took his leave, and so they departed, and came unto\nWinchester. And when Arthur wist that Sir Launcelot was come whole and\nsound the king made great joy of him, and so did Sir Gawaine and all the\nknights of the Round Table except Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred. Also\nQueen Guenever was wood wroth with Sir Launcelot, and would by no means\nspeak with him, but estranged herself from him; and Sir Launcelot made\nall the means that he might for to speak with the queen, but it would\nnot be.\n\nNow speak we of the Fair Maiden of Astolat that made such sorrow day\nand night that she never slept, ate, nor drank, and ever she made her\ncomplaint unto Sir Launcelot. So when she had thus endured a ten days,\nthat she feebled so that she must needs pass out of this world, then\nshe shrived her clean, and received her Creator. And ever she complained\nstill upon Sir Launcelot. Then her ghostly father bade her leave such\nthoughts. Then she said, why should I leave such thoughts? Am I not an\nearthly woman? And all the while the breath is in my body I may complain\nme, for my belief is I do none offence though I love an earthly man; and\nI take God to my record I loved never none but Sir Launcelot du Lake,\nnor never shall, and a clean maiden I am for him and for all other; and\nsithen it is the sufferance of God that I shall die for the love of so\nnoble a knight, I beseech the High Father of Heaven to have mercy\nupon my soul, and upon mine innumerable pains that I suffered may\nbe allegeance of part of my sins. For sweet Lord Jesu, said the fair\nmaiden, I take Thee to record, on Thee I was never great offencer\nagainst thy laws; but that I loved this noble knight, Sir Launcelot, out\nof measure, and of myself, good Lord, I might not withstand the fervent\nlove wherefore I have my death.\n\nAnd then she called her father, Sir Bernard, and her brother, Sir Tirre,\nand heartily she prayed her father that her brother might write a letter\nlike as she did indite it: and so her father granted her. And when the\nletter was written word by word like as she devised, then she prayed her\nfather that she might be watched until she were dead. And while my body\nis hot let this letter be put in my right hand, and my hand bound fast\nwith the letter until that I be cold; and let me be put in a fair bed\nwith all the richest clothes that I have about me, and so let my bed and\nall my richest clothes be laid with me in a chariot unto the next place\nwhere Thames is; and there let me be put within a barget, and but one\nman with me, such as ye trust to steer me thither, and that my barget be\ncovered with black samite over and over: thus father I beseech you let\nit be done. So her father granted it her faithfully, all things should\nbe done like as she had devised. Then her father and her brother made\ngreat dole, for when this was done anon she died. And so when she was\ndead the corpse and the bed all was led the next way unto Thames, and\nthere a man, and the corpse, and all, were put into Thames; and so the\nman steered the barget unto Westminster, and there he rowed a great\nwhile to and fro or any espied it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. How the corpse of the Maid of Astolat arrived to-fore\nKing Arthur, and of the burying, and how Sir Launcelot offered the\nmass-penny.\n\n\nSO by fortune King Arthur and the Queen Guenever were speaking together\nat a window, and so as they looked into Thames they espied this black\nbarget, and had marvel what it meant. Then the king called Sir Kay,\nand showed it him. Sir, said Sir Kay, wit you well there is some new\ntidings. Go thither, said the king to Sir Kay, and take with you Sir\nBrandiles and Agravaine, and bring me ready word what is there. Then\nthese four knights departed and came to the barget and went in; and\nthere they found the fairest corpse lying in a rich bed, and a poor man\nsitting in the barget's end, and no word would he speak. So these four\nknights returned unto the king again, and told him what they found. That\nfair corpse will I see, said the king. And so then the king took the\nqueen by the hand, and went thither.\n\nThen the king made the barget to be holden fast, and then the king and\nthe queen entered with certain knights with them; and there he saw the\nfairest woman lie in a rich bed, covered unto her middle with many rich\nclothes, and all was of cloth of gold, and she lay as though she had\nsmiled. Then the queen espied a letter in her right hand, and told it to\nthe king. Then the king took it and said: Now am I sure this letter will\ntell what she was, and why she is come hither. So then the king and the\nqueen went out of the barget, and so commanded a certain man to wait\nupon the barget.\n\nAnd so when the king was come within his chamber, he called many knights\nabout him, and said that he would wit openly what was written within\nthat letter. Then the king brake it, and made a clerk to read it, and\nthis was the intent of the letter. Most noble knight, Sir Launcelot, now\nhath death made us two at debate for your love. I was your lover, that\nmen called the Fair Maiden of Astolat; therefore unto all ladies I make\nmy moan, yet pray for my soul and bury me at least, and offer ye my\nmass-penny: this is my last request. And a clean maiden I died, I take\nGod to witness: pray for my soul, Sir Launcelot, as thou art peerless.\nThis was all the substance in the letter. And when it was read, the\nking, the queen, and all the knights wept for pity of the doleful\ncomplaints. Then was Sir Launcelot sent for; and when he was come King\nArthur made the letter to be read to him.\n\nAnd when Sir Launcelot heard it word by word, he said: My lord Arthur,\nwit ye well I am right heavy of the death of this fair damosel: God\nknoweth I was never causer of her death by my willing, and that will I\nreport me to her own brother: here he is, Sir Lavaine. I will not say\nnay, said Sir Launcelot, but that she was both fair and good, and much\nI was beholden unto her, but she loved me out of measure. Ye might have\nshewed her, said the queen, some bounty and gentleness that might have\npreserved her life. Madam, said Sir Launcelot, she would none other ways\nbe answered but that she would be my wife, outher else my paramour; and\nof these two I would not grant her, but I proffered her, for her good\nlove that she shewed me, a thousand pound yearly to her, and to her\nheirs, and to wed any manner knight that she could find best to love in\nher heart. For madam, said Sir Launcelot, I love not to be constrained\nto love; for love must arise of the heart, and not by no constraint.\nThat is truth, said the king, and many knight's love is free in himself,\nand never will be bounden, for where he is bounden he looseth himself.\n\nThen said the king unto Sir Launcelot: It will be your worship that ye\noversee that she be interred worshipfully. Sir, said Sir Launcelot, that\nshall be done as I can best devise. And so many knights yede thither to\nbehold that fair maiden. And so upon the morn she was interred richly,\nand Sir Launcelot offered her mass-penny; and all the knights of the\nTable Round that were there at that time offered with Sir Launcelot. And\nthen the poor man went again with the barget. Then the queen sent for\nSir Launcelot, and prayed him of mercy, for why that she had been wroth\nwith him causeless. This is not the first time, said Sir Launcelot, that\nye had been displeased with me causeless, but, madam, ever I must suffer\nyou, but what sorrow I endure I take no force. So this passed on all\nthat winter, with all manner of hunting and hawking, and jousts and\ntourneys were many betwixt many great lords, and ever in all places\nSir Lavaine gat great worship, so that he was nobly renowned among many\nknights of the Table Round.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. Of great jousts done all a Christmas, and of a great jousts\nand tourney ordained by King Arthur, and of Sir Launcelot.\n\n\nTHUS it passed on till Christmas, and then every day there was jousts\nmade for a diamond, who that jousted best should have a diamond. But Sir\nLauncelot would not joust but if it were at a great jousts cried. But\nSir Lavaine jousted there all that Christmas passingly well, and best\nwas praised, for there were but few that did so well. Wherefore all\nmanner of knights deemed that Sir Lavaine should be made knight of the\nTable Round at the next feast of Pentecost. So at-after Christmas King\nArthur let call unto him many knights, and there they advised together\nto make a party and a great tournament and jousts. And the King of\nNorthgalis said to Arthur, he would have on his party King Anguish\nof Ireland, and the King with the Hundred Knights, and the King of\nNorthumberland, and Sir Galahad, the haut prince. And so these four\nkings and this mighty duke took part against King Arthur and the knights\nof the Table Round. And the cry was made that the day of the jousts\nshould be beside Westminster upon Candlemas Day, whereof many knights\nwere glad, and made them ready to be at that jousts in the freshest\nmanner.\n\nThen Queen Guenever sent for Sir Launcelot, and said thus: I warn you\nthat ye ride no more in no jousts nor tournaments but that your kinsmen\nmay know you. And at these jousts that shall be ye shall have of me a\nsleeve of gold; and I pray you for my sake enforce yourself there, that\nmen may speak of you worship; but I charge you as ye will have my love,\nthat ye warn your kinsmen that ye will bear that day the sleeve of gold\nupon your helmet. Madam, said Sir Launcelot, it shall be done. And so\neither made great joy of other. And when Sir Launcelot saw his time he\ntold Sir Bors that he would depart, and have no more with him but Sir\nLavaine, unto the good hermit that dwelt in that forest of Windsor; his\nname was Sir Brasias; and there he thought to repose him, and take all\nthe rest that he might, because he would be fresh at that day of jousts.\n\nSo Sir Launcelot and Sir Lavaine departed, that no creature wist where\nhe was become, but the noble men of his blood. And when he was come to\nthe hermitage, wit ye well he had good cheer. And so daily Sir Launcelot\nwould go to a well fast by the hermitage, and there he would lie down,\nand see the well spring and burble, and sometime he slept there. So at\nthat time there was a lady dwelt in that forest, and she was a great\nhuntress, and daily she used to hunt, and ever she bare her bow with\nher; and no men went never with her, but always women, and they were\nshooters, and could well kill a deer, both at the stalk and at the\ntrest; and they daily bare bows and arrows, horns and wood-knives,\nand many good dogs they had, both for the string and for a bait. So it\nhapped this lady the huntress had abated her dog for the bow at a barren\nhind, and so this barren hind took the flight over hedges and woods. And\never this lady and part of her women costed the hind, and checked it by\nthe noise of the hounds, to have met with the hind at some water; and so\nit happed, the hind came to the well whereas Sir Launcelot was sleeping\nand slumbering. And so when the hind came to the well, for heat she went\nto soil, and there she lay a great while; and the dog came after, and\numbecast about, for she had lost the very perfect feute of the hind.\nRight so came that lady the huntress, that knew by the dog that she had,\nthat the hind was at the soil in that well; and there she came stiffly\nand found the hind, and she put a broad arrow in her bow, and shot at\nthe hind, and over-shot the hind; and so by misfortune the arrow smote\nSir Launcelot in the thick of the buttock, over the barbs. When Sir\nLauncelot felt himself so hurt, he hurled up woodly, and saw the lady\nthat had smitten him. And when he saw she was a woman, he said thus:\nLady or damosel, what that thou be, in an evil time bear ye a bow; the\ndevil made you a shooter.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. How Launcelot after that he was hurt of a gentlewoman came\nto an hermit, and of other matters.\n\n\nNOW mercy, fair sir, said the lady, I am a gentlewoman that useth here\nin this forest hunting, and God knoweth I saw ye not; but as here was\na barren hind at the soil in this well, and I weened to have done well,\nbut my hand swerved. Alas, said Sir Launcelot, ye have mischieved me.\nAnd so the lady departed, and Sir Launcelot as he might pulled out the\narrow, and left that head still in his buttock, and so he went weakly\nto the hermitage ever more bleeding as he went. And when Sir Lavaine and\nthe hermit espied that Sir Launcelot was hurt, wit you well they were\npassing heavy, but Sir Lavaine wist not how that he was hurt nor by\nwhom. And then were they wroth out of measure.\n\nThen with great pain the hermit gat out the arrow's head out of Sir\nLauncelot's buttock, and much of his blood he shed, and the wound was\npassing sore, and unhappily smitten, for it was in such a place that he\nmight not sit in no saddle. Have mercy, Jesu, said Sir Launcelot, I may\ncall myself the most unhappiest man that liveth, for ever when I would\nfainest have worship there befalleth me ever some unhappy thing. Now so\nJesu me help, said Sir Launcelot, and if no man would but God, I shall\nbe in the field upon Candlemas Day at the jousts, whatsomever fall of\nit: so all that might be gotten to heal Sir Launcelot was had.\n\nSo when the day was come Sir Launcelot let devise that he was arrayed,\nand Sir Lavaine, and their horses, as though they had been Saracens; and\nso they departed and came nigh to the field. The King of Northgalis with\nan hundred knights with him, and the King of Northumberland brought with\nhim an hundred good knights, and King Anguish of Ireland brought with\nhim an hundred good knights ready to joust, and Sir Galahad, the haut\nprince, brought with him an hundred good knights, and the King with the\nHundred Knights brought with him as many, and all these were proved good\nknights. Then came in King Arthur's party; and there came in the King of\nScots with an hundred knights, and King Uriens of Gore brought with\nhim an hundred knights, and King Howel of Brittany brought with him an\nhundred knights, and Chaleins of Clarance brought with him an hundred\nknights, and King Arthur himself came into the field with two hundred\nknights, and the most part were knights of the Table Round, that were\nproved noble knights; and there were old knights set in scaffolds for to\njudge, with the queen, who did best.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII. How Sir Launcelot behaved him at the jousts, and other\nmen also.\n\n\nTHEN they blew to the field; and there the King of Northgalis\nencountered with the King of Scots, and there the King of Scots had a\nfall; and the King of Ireland smote down King Uriens; and the King of\nNorthumberland smote down King Howel of Brittany; and Sir Galahad, the\nhaut prince, smote down Chaleins of Clarance. And then King Arthur was\nwood wroth, and ran to the King with the Hundred Knights, and there King\nArthur smote him down; and after with that same spear King Arthur smote\ndown three other knights. And then when his spear was broken King Arthur\ndid passingly well; and so therewithal came in Sir Gawaine and Sir\nGaheris, Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred, and there everych of them smote\ndown a knight, and Sir Gawaine smote down four knights; and then there\nbegan a strong medley, for then there came in the knights of Launcelot's\nblood, and Sir Gareth and Sir Palomides with them, and many knights of\nthe Table Round, and they began to hold the four kings and the mighty\nduke so hard that they were discomfit; but this Duke Galahad, the haut\nprince, was a noble knight, and by his mighty prowess of arms he held\nthe knights of the Table Round strait enough.\n\nAll this doing saw Sir Launcelot, and then he came into the field with\nSir Lavaine as it had been thunder. And then anon Sir Bors and the\nknights of his blood espied Sir Launcelot, and said to them all: I\nwarn you beware of him with the sleeve of gold upon his head, for he is\nhimself Sir Launcelot du Lake; and for great goodness Sir Bors warned\nSir Gareth. I am well apaid, said Sir Gareth, that I may know him. But\nwho is he, said they all, that rideth with him in the same array?\nThat is the good and gentle knight Sir Lavaine, said Sir Bors. So Sir\nLauncelot encountered with Sir Gawaine, and there by force Sir Launcelot\nsmote down Sir Gawaine and his horse to the earth, and so he smote down\nSir Agravaine and Sir Gaheris, and also he smote down Sir Mordred, and\nall this was with one spear. Then Sir Lavaine met with Sir Palomides,\nand either met other so hard and so fiercely that both their horses\nfell to the earth. And then were they horsed again, and then met Sir\nLauncelot with Sir Palomides, and there Sir Palomides had a fall; and so\nSir Launcelot or ever he stint, as fast as he might get spears, he smote\ndown thirty knights, and the most part of them were knights of the Table\nRound; and ever the knights of his blood withdrew them, and made them\nado in other places where Sir Launcelot came not.\n\nAnd then King Arthur was wroth when he saw Sir Launcelot do such deeds;\nand then the king called unto him Sir Gawaine, Sir Mordred, Sir Kay, Sir\nGriflet, Sir Lucan the Butler, Sir Bedivere, Sir Palomides, Sir Safere,\nhis brother; and so the king with these nine knights made them ready to\nset upon Sir Launcelot, and upon Sir Lavaine. All this espied Sir Bors\nand Sir Gareth. Now I dread me sore, said Sir Bors, that my lord, Sir\nLauncelot, will be hard matched. By my head, said Sir Gareth, I will\nride unto my lord Sir Launcelot, for to help him, fall of him what fall\nmay, for he is the same man that made me knight. Ye shall not so, said\nSir Bors, by my counsel, unless that ye were disguised. Ye shall see\nme disguised, said Sir Gareth; and therewithal he espied a Welsh knight\nwhere he was to repose him, and he was sore hurt afore by Sir Gawaine,\nand to him Sir Gareth rode, and prayed him of his knighthood to lend\nhim his shield for his. I will well, said the Welsh knight. And when Sir\nGareth had his shield, the book saith it was green, with a maiden that\nseemed in it.\n\nThen Sir Gareth came driving to Sir Launcelot all that he might and\nsaid: Knight, keep thyself, for yonder cometh King Arthur with nine\nnoble knights with him to put you to a rebuke, and so I am come to\nbear you fellowship for old love ye have shewed me. Gramercy, said Sir\nLauncelot. Sir, said Sir Gareth, encounter ye with Sir Gawaine, and I\nshall encounter with Sir Palomides; and let Sir Lavaine match with the\nnoble King Arthur. And when we have delivered them, let us three hold\nus sadly together. Then came King Arthur with his nine knights with\nhim, and Sir Launcelot encountered with Sir Gawaine, and gave him such\na buffet that the arson of his saddle brast, and Sir Gawaine fell to the\nearth. Then Sir Gareth encountered with the good knight Sir Palomides,\nand he gave him such a buffet that both his horse and he dashed to the\nearth. Then encountered King Arthur with Sir Lavaine, and there either\nof them smote other to the earth, horse and all, that they lay a great\nwhile. Then Sir Launcelot smote down Sir Agravaine, and Sir Gaheris, and\nSir Mordred; and Sir Gareth smote down Sir Kay, and Sir Safere, and Sir\nGriflet. And then Sir Lavaine was horsed again, and he smote down Sir\nLucan the Butler and Sir Bedevere and then there began great throng of\ngood knights.\n\nThen Sir Launcelot hurtled here and there, and raced and pulled off\nhelms, so that at that time there might none sit him a buffet with\nspear nor with sword; and Sir Gareth did such deeds of arms that all men\nmarvelled what knight he was with the green shield, for he smote down\nthat day and pulled down mo than thirty knights And, as the French book\nsaith, Sir Launcelot marvelled; when he beheld Sir Gareth do such deeds,\nwhat knight he might be; and Sir Lavaine pulled down and smote down\ntwenty knights. Also Sir Launcelot knew not Sir Gareth for an Sir\nTristram de Liones, outher Sir Lamorak de Galis had been alive, Sir\nLauncelot would have deemed he had been one of them twain. So ever as\nSir Launcelot Sir Gareth, Sir Lavaine fought, and on the one side\nSir Bors, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir Lionel, Sir Lamorak de Galis, Sir\nBleoberis, Sir Galihud, Sir Galihodin, Sir Pelleas, and with mo other of\nKing Ban's blood fought upon another party, and held the King with the\nHundred Knights and the King of Northumberland right strait.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV. How King Arthur marvelled much of the jousting in the\nfield, and how he rode and found Sir Launcelot.\n\n\nSO this tournament and this jousts dured long, till it was near night,\nfor the knights of the Round Table relieved ever unto King Arthur; for\nthe king was wroth out of measure that he and his knights might not\nprevail that day. Then Sir Gawaine said to the king: I marvel where all\nthis day [be] Sir Bors de Ganis and his fellowship of Sir Launcelot's\nblood, I marvel all this day they be not about you: it is for some cause\nsaid Sir Gawaine. By my head, said Sir Kay, Sir Bors is yonder all this\nday upon the right hand of this field, and there he and his blood do\nmore worshipfully than we do. It may well be, said Sir Gawaine, but I\ndread me ever of guile; for on pain of my life, said Sir Gawaine, this\nknight with the red sleeve of gold is himself Sir Launcelot, I see well\nby his riding and by his great strokes; and the other knight in the same\ncolours is the good young knight, Sir Lavaine. Also that knight with\nthe green shield is my brother, Sir Gareth, and yet he hath disguised\nhimself, for no man shall never make him be against Sir Launcelot,\nbecause he made him knight. By my head, said Arthur, nephew, I believe\nyou; therefore tell me now what is your best counsel. Sir, said Sir\nGawaine, ye shall have my counsel: let blow unto lodging, for an he be\nSir Launcelot du Lake, and my brother, Sir Gareth, with him, with the\nhelp of that good young knight, Sir Lavaine, trust me truly it will be\nno boot to strive with them but if we should fall ten or twelve upon\none knight, and that were no worship, but shame. Ye say truth, said the\nking; and for to say sooth, said the king, it were shame to us so many\nas we be to set upon them any more; for wit ye well, said King Arthur,\nthey be three good knights, and namely that knight with the sleeve of\ngold.\n\nSo then they blew unto lodging; but forthwithal King Arthur let send\nunto the four kings, and to the mighty duke, and prayed them that the\nknight with the sleeve of gold depart not from them, but that the king\nmay speak with him. Then forthwithal King Arthur alighted and unarmed\nhim, and took a little hackney and rode after Sir Launcelot, for ever\nhe had a spy upon him. And so he found him among the four kings and the\nduke; and there the king prayed them all unto supper, and they said they\nwould with good will. And when they were unarmed then King Arthur knew\nSir Launcelot, Sir Lavaine, and Sir Gareth. Ah, Sir Launcelot, said King\nArthur, this day ye have heated me and my knights.\n\nSo they yede unto Arthur's lodging all together, and there was a great\nfeast and great revel, and the prize was given unto Sir Launcelot; and\nby heralds they named him that he had smitten down fifty knights, and\nSir Gareth five-and-thirty, and Sir Lavaine four-and-twenty knights.\nThen Sir Launcelot told the king and the queen how the lady huntress\nshot him in the forest of Windsor, in the buttock, with an broad arrow,\nand how the wound thereof was that time six inches deep, and in like\nlong. Also Arthur blamed Sir Gareth because he left his fellowship and\nheld with Sir Launcelot. My lord, said Sir Gareth, he made me a knight,\nand when I saw him so hard bestead, methought it was my worship to help\nhim, for I saw him do so much, and so many noble knights against him;\nand when I understood that he was Sir Launcelot du Lake, I shamed to\nsee so many knights against him alone. Truly, said King Arthur unto Sir\nGareth, ye say well, and worshipfully have ye done and to yourself great\nworship; and all the days of my life, said King Arthur unto Sir Gareth,\nwit you well I shall love you, and trust you the more better. For ever,\nsaid Arthur, it is a worshipful knight's deed to help another worshipful\nknight when he seeth him in a great danger; for ever a worshipful man\nwill be loath to see a worshipful man shamed; and he that is of no\nworship, and fareth with cowardice, never shall he show gentleness, nor\nno manner of goodness where he seeth a man in any danger, for then\never will a coward show no mercy; and always a good man will do ever\nto another man as he would be done to himself. So then there were great\nfeasts unto kings and dukes, and revel, game, and play, and all manner\nof noblesse was used; and he that was courteous, true, and faithful, to\nhis friend was that time cherished.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV. How true love is likened to summer.\n\n\nAND thus it passed on from Candlemass until after Easter, that the month\nof May was come, when every lusty heart beginneth to blossom, and to\nbring forth fruit; for like as herbs and trees bring forth fruit and\nflourish in May, in like wise every lusty heart that is in any manner a\nlover, springeth and flourisheth in lusty deeds. For it giveth unto all\nlovers courage, that lusty month of May, in something to constrain him\nto some manner of thing more in that month than in any other month, for\ndivers causes. For then all herbs and trees renew a man and woman, and\nlikewise lovers call again to their mind old gentleness and old service,\nand many kind deeds that were forgotten by negligence. For like as\nwinter rasure doth alway arase and deface green summer, so fareth it\nby unstable love in man and woman. For in many persons there is no\nstability; for we may see all day, for a little blast of winter's\nrasure, anon we shall deface and lay apart true love for little or\nnought, that cost much thing; this is no wisdom nor stability, but it\nis feebleness of nature and great disworship, whosomever useth this.\nTherefore, like as May month flowereth and flourisheth in many gardens,\nso in like wise let every man of worship flourish his heart in this\nworld, first unto God, and next unto the joy of them that he promised\nhis faith unto; for there was never worshipful man or worshipful woman,\nbut they loved one better than another; and worship in arms may never\nbe foiled, but first reserve the honour to God, and secondly the quarrel\nmust come of thy lady: and such love I call virtuous love.\n\nBut nowadays men can not love seven night but they must have all their\ndesires: that love may not endure by reason; for where they be soon\naccorded and hasty heat, soon it cooleth. Right so fareth love nowadays,\nsoon hot soon cold: this is no stability. But the old love was not so;\nmen and women could love together seven years, and no licours lusts were\nbetween them, and then was love, truth, and faithfulness: and lo, in\nlike wise was used love in King Arthur's days. Wherefore I liken love\nnowadays unto summer and winter; for like as the one is hot and the\nother cold, so fareth love nowadays; therefore all ye that be lovers\ncall unto your remembrance the month of May, like as did Queen Guenever,\nfor whom I make here a little mention, that while she lived she was a\ntrue lover, and therefore she had a good end.\n\n\n_Explicit liber Octodecimus. And here followeth liber xix._\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XIX.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. How Queen Guenever rode a-Maying with certain knights of the\nRound Table and clad all in green.\n\n\nSO it befell in the month of May, Queen Guenever called unto her knights\nof the Table Round; and she gave them warning that early upon the morrow\nshe would ride a-Maying into woods and fields beside Westminster. And I\nwarn you that there be none of you but that he be well horsed, and that\nye all be clothed in green, outher in silk outher in cloth; and I shall\nbring with me ten ladies, and every knight shall have a lady behind him,\nand every knight shall have a squire and two yeomen; and I will that ye\nall be well horsed. So they made them ready in the freshest manner.\nAnd these were the names of the knights: Sir Kay le Seneschal, Sir\nAgravaine, Sir Brandiles, Sir Sagramore le Desirous, Sir Dodinas le\nSavage, Sir Ozanna le Cure Hardy, Sir Ladinas of the Forest Savage, Sir\nPersant of Inde, Sir Ironside, that was called the Knight of the Red\nLaunds, and Sir Pelleas, the lover; and these ten knights made them\nready in the freshest manner to ride with the queen. And so upon the\nmorn they took their horses with the queen, and rode a-Maying in woods\nand meadows as it pleased them, in great joy and delights; for the queen\nhad cast to have been again with King Arthur at the furthest by ten of\nthe clock, and so was that time her purpose.\n\nThen there was a knight that hight Meliagrance, and he was son unto King\nBagdemagus, and this knight had at that time a castle of the gift of\nKing Arthur within seven mile of Westminster. And this knight, Sir\nMeliagrance, loved passing well Queen Guenever, and so had he done long\nand many years. And the book saith he had lain in await for to steal\naway the queen, but evermore he forbare for because of Sir Launcelot;\nfor in no wise he would meddle with the queen an Sir Launcelot were in\nher company, outher else an he were near-hand her. And that time was\nsuch a custom, the queen rode never without a great fellowship of men of\narms about her, and they were many good knights, and the most part were\nyoung men that would have worship; and they were called the Queen's\nKnights, and never in no battle, tournament, nor jousts, they bare none\nof them no manner of knowledging of their own arms, but plain white\nshields, and thereby they were called the Queen's Knights. And then when\nit happed any of them to be of great worship by his noble deeds, then at\nthe next Feast of Pentecost, if there were any slain or dead, as there\nwas none year that there failed but some were dead, then was there\nchosen in his stead that was dead the most men of worship, that were\ncalled the Queen's Knights. And thus they came up all first, or they\nwere renowned men of worship, both Sir Launcelot and all the remnant of\nthem.\n\nBut this knight, Sir Meliagrance, had espied the queen well and her\npurpose, and how Sir Launcelot was not with her, and how she had no\nmen of arms with her but the ten noble knights all arrayed in green for\nMaying. Then he purveyed him a twenty men of arms and an hundred archers\nfor to destroy the queen and her knights, for he thought that time was\nbest season to take the queen.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. How Sir Meliagrance took the queen and her knights, which\nwere sore hurt in fighting.\n\n\nSO as the queen had Mayed and all her knights, all were bedashed with\nherbs, mosses and flowers, in the best manner and freshest. Right\nso came out of a wood Sir Meliagrance with an eight score men well\nharnessed, as they should fight in a battle of arrest, and bade the\nqueen and her knights abide, for maugre their heads they should abide.\nTraitor knight, said Queen Guenever, what cast thou for to do? Wilt thou\nshame thyself? Bethink thee how thou art a king's son, and knight of the\nTable Round, and thou to be about to dishonour the noble king that made\nthee knight; thou shamest all knighthood and thyself, and me, I let thee\nwit, shalt thou never shame, for I had liefer cut mine own throat in\ntwain rather than thou shouldest dishonour me. As for all this language,\nsaid Sir Meliagrance, be it as it be may, for wit you well, madam, I\nhave loved you many a year, and never or now could I get you at such an\nadvantage as I do now, and therefore I will take you as I find you.\n\nThen spake all the ten noble knights at once and said: Sir Meliagrance,\nwit thou well ye are about to jeopard your worship to dishonour, and\nalso ye cast to jeopard our persons howbeit we be unarmed. Ye have us\nat a great avail, for it seemeth by you that ye have laid watch upon us;\nbut rather than ye should put the queen to a shame and us all, we had\nas lief to depart from our lives, for an if we other ways did, we were\nshamed for ever. Then said Sir Meliagrance: Dress you as well ye can,\nand keep the queen. Then the ten knights of the Table Round drew their\nswords, and the other let run at them with their spears, and the ten\nknights manly abode them, and smote away their spears that no spear did\nthem none harm. Then they lashed together with swords, and anon Sir Kay,\nSir Sagramore, Sir Agravaine, Sir Dodinas, Sir Ladinas, and Sir Ozanna\nwere smitten to the earth with grimly wounds. Then Sir Brandiles, and\nSir Persant, Sir Ironside, Sir Pelleas fought long, and they were sore\nwounded, for these ten knights, or ever they were laid to the ground,\nslew forty men of the boldest and the best of them.\n\nSo when the queen saw her knights thus dolefully wounded, and needs\nmust be slain at the last, then for pity and sorrow she cried Sir\nMeliagrance: Slay not my noble knights, and I will go with thee upon\nthis covenant, that thou save them, and suffer them not to be no more\nhurt, with this, that they be led with me wheresomever thou leadest\nme, for I will rather slay myself than I will go with thee, unless that\nthese my noble knights may be in my presence. Madam, said Meliagrance,\nfor your sake they shall be led with you into mine own castle, with\nthat ye will be ruled, and ride with me. Then the queen prayed the four\nknights to leave their fighting, and she and they would not depart.\nMadam, said Sir Pelleas, we will do as ye do, for as for me I take no\nforce of my life nor death. For as the French book saith, Sir Pelleas\ngave such buffets there that none armour might hold him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. How Sir Launcelot had word how the queen was taken, and how\nSir Meliagrance laid a bushment for Launcelot.\n\n\nTHEN by the queen's commandment they left battle, and dressed the\nwounded knights on horseback, some sitting, some overthwart their\nhorses, that it was pity to behold them. And then Sir Meliagrance\ncharged the queen and all her knights that none of all her fellowship\nshould depart from her; for full sore he dread Sir Launcelot du Lake,\nlest he should have any knowledging. All this espied the queen, and\nprivily she called unto her a child of her chamber that was swiftly\nhorsed, to whom she said: Go thou, when thou seest thy time, and bear\nthis ring unto Sir Launcelot du Lake, and pray him as he loveth me that\nhe will see me and rescue me, if ever he will have joy of me; and spare\nnot thy horse, said the queen, neither for water, neither for land. So\nthe child espied his time, and lightly he took his horse with the spurs,\nand departed as fast as he might. And when Sir Meliagrance saw him so\nflee, he understood that it was by the queen's commandment for to warn\nSir Launcelot. Then they that were best horsed chased him and shot at\nhim, but from them all the child went suddenly. And then Sir Meliagrance\nsaid to the queen: Madam, ye are about to betray me, but I shall ordain\nfor Sir Launcelot that he shall not come lightly at you. And then he\nrode with her, and they all, to his castle, in all the haste that they\nmight. And by the way Sir Meliagrance laid in an embushment the best\narchers that he might get in his country, to the number of thirty, to\nawait upon Sir Launcelot, charging them that if they saw such a manner\nof knight come by the way upon a white horse, that in any wise they slay\nhis horse, but in no manner of wise have not ado with him bodily, for he\nis over-hardy to be overcome.\n\nSo this was done, and they were come to his castle, but in no wise the\nqueen would never let none of the ten knights and her ladies out of her\nsight, but always they were in her presence; for the book saith,\nSir Meliagrance durst make no masteries, for dread of Sir Launcelot,\ninsomuch he deemed that he had warning. So when the child was departed\nfrom the fellowship of Sir Meliagrance, within a while he came to\nWestminster, and anon he found Sir Launcelot. And when he had told his\nmessage, and delivered him the queen's ring: Alas, said Sir Launcelot,\nnow I am shamed for ever, unless that I may rescue that noble lady from\ndishonour. Then eagerly he asked his armour; and ever the child told Sir\nLauncelot how the ten knights fought marvellously, and how Sir Pelleas,\nand Sir Ironside, and Sir Brandiles, and Sir Persant of Inde, fought\nstrongly, but namely Sir Pelleas, there might none withstand him; and\nhow they all fought till at the last they were laid to the earth; and\nthen the queen made appointment for to save their lives, and go with Sir\nMeliagrance.\n\nAlas, said Sir Launcelot, that most noble lady, that she should be so\ndestroyed; I had liefer, said Sir Launcelot, than all France, that I\nhad been there well armed. So when Sir Launcelot was armed and upon his\nhorse, he prayed the child of the queen's chamber to warn Sir Lavaine\nhow suddenly he was departed, and for what cause. And pray him as he\nloveth me, that he will hie him after me, and that he stint not until\nhe come to the castle where Sir Meliagrance abideth, or dwelleth; for\nthere, said Sir Launcelot, he shall hear of me an I am a man living,\nand rescue the queen and the ten knights the which he traitorously hath\ntaken, and that shall I prove upon his head, and all them that hold with\nhim.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. How Sir Launcelot's horse was slain, and how Sir Launcelot\nrode in a cart for to rescue the queen.\n\n\nTHEN Sir Launcelot rode as fast as he might, and the book saith he took\nthe water at Westminster Bridge, and made his horse to swim over Thames\nunto Lambeth. And then within a while he came to the same place\nthereas the ten noble knights fought with Sir Meliagrance. And then Sir\nLauncelot followed the track until that he came to a wood, and there\nwas a straight way, and there the thirty archers bade Sir Launcelot\nturn again, and follow no longer that track. What commandment have ye\nthereto, said Sir Launcelot, to cause me that am a knight of the Round\nTable to leave my right way? This way shalt thou leave, other-else thou\nshalt go it on thy foot, for wit thou well thy horse shall be slain.\nThat is little mastery, said Sir Launcelot, to slay mine horse; but as\nfor myself, when my horse is slain, I give right nought for you, not an\nye were five hundred more. So then they shot Sir Launcelot's horse, and\nsmote him with many arrows; and then Sir Launcelot avoided his horse,\nand went on foot; but there were so many ditches and hedges betwixt them\nand him that he might not meddle with none of them. Alas for shame, said\nLauncelot, that ever one knight should betray another knight; but it is\nan old saw, A good man is never in danger but when he is in the danger\nof a coward. Then Sir Launcelot went a while, and then he was foul\ncumbered of his armour, his shield, and his spear, and all that longed\nunto him. Wit ye well he was full sore annoyed, and full loath he\nwas for to leave anything that longed unto him, for he dread sore the\ntreason of Sir Meliagrance.\n\nThen by fortune there came by him a chariot that came thither for to\nfetch wood. Say me, carter, said Sir Launcelot, what shall I give thee\nto suffer me to leap into thy chariot, and that thou bring me unto a\ncastle within this two mile? Thou shalt not come within my chariot,\nsaid the carter, for I am sent for to fetch wood for my lord, Sir\nMeliagrance. With him would I speak. Thou shalt not go with me, said the\ncarter. Then Sir Launcelot leapt to him, and gave him such a buffet that\nhe fell to the earth stark dead. Then the other carter, his fellow, was\nafeard, and weened to have gone the same way; and then he cried: Fair\nlord, save my life, and I shall bring you where ye will. Then I charge\nthee, said Sir Launcelot, that thou drive me and this chariot even unto\nSir Meliagrance's gate. Leap up into the chariot, said the carter, and\nye shall be there anon. So the carter drove on a great wallop, and Sir\nLauncelot's horse followed the chariot, with more than a forty arrows\nbroad and rough in him.\n\nAnd more than an hour and an half Dame Guenever was awaiting in a\nbay window with her ladies, and espied an armed knight standing in a\nchariot. See, madam, said a lady, where rideth in a chariot a goodly\narmed knight; I suppose he rideth unto hanging. Where? said the queen.\nThen she espied by his shield that he was there himself, Sir Launcelot\ndu Lake. And then she was ware where came his horse ever after that\nchariot, and ever he trod his guts and his paunch under his feet. Alas,\nsaid the queen, now I see well and prove, that well is him that hath\na trusty friend. Ha, ha, most noble knight, said Queen Guenever, I\nsee well thou art hard bestead when thou ridest in a chariot. Then she\nrebuked that lady that likened Sir Launcelot to ride in a chariot to\nhanging. It was foul mouthed, said the queen, and evil likened, so for\nto liken the most noble knight of the world unto such a shameful death.\nO Jesu defend him and keep him, said the queen, from all mischievous\nend. By this was Sir Launcelot come to the gates of that castle, and\nthere he descended down, and cried, that all the castle rang of it:\nWhere art thou, false traitor, Sir Meliagrance, and knight of the Table\nRound? now come forth here, thou traitor knight, thou and thy fellowship\nwith thee; for here I am, Sir Launcelot du Lake, that shall fight with\nyou. And therewithal he bare the gate wide open upon the porter, and\nsmote him under his ear with his gauntlet, that his neck brast a-sunder.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. How Sir Meliagrance required forgiveness of the queen, and\nhow she appeased Sir Launcelot; and other matters.\n\n\nWHEN Sir Meliagrance heard that Sir Launcelot was there he ran unto\nQueen Guenever, and fell upon his knee, and said: Mercy, madam, now I\nput me wholly into your grace. What aileth you now? said Queen Guenever;\nforsooth I might well wit some good knight would revenge me, though my\nlord Arthur wist not of this your work. Madam, said Sir Meliagrance, all\nthis that is amiss on my part shall be amended right as yourself will\ndevise, and wholly I put me in your grace. What would ye that I did?\nsaid the queen. I would no more, said Meliagrance, but that ye would\ntake all in your own hands, and that ye will rule my lord Sir Launcelot;\nand such cheer as may be made him in this poor castle ye and he\nshall have until to-morn, and then may ye and all they return unto\nWestminster; and my body and all that I have I shall put in your rule.\nYe say well, said the queen, and better is peace than ever war, and the\nless noise the more is my worship.\n\nThen the queen and her ladies went down unto the knight, Sir Launcelot,\nthat stood wroth out of measure in the inner court, to abide battle; and\never he bade: Thou traitor knight come forth. Then the queen came to\nhim and said: Sir Launcelot, why be ye so moved? Ha, madam, said Sir\nLauncelot, why ask ye me that question? Meseemeth, said Sir Launcelot,\nye ought to be more wroth than I am, for ye have the hurt and the\ndishonour, for wit ye well, madam, my hurt is but little for the killing\nof a mare's son, but the despite grieveth me much more than all my hurt.\nTruly, said the queen, ye say truth; but heartily I thank you, said the\nqueen, but ye must come in with me peaceably, for all thing is put in\nmy hand, and all that is evil shall be for the best, for the knight full\nsore repenteth him of the misadventure that is befallen him. Madam, said\nSir Launcelot, sith it is so that ye been accorded with him, as for me\nI may not be again it, howbeit Sir Meliagrance hath done full shamefully\nto me, and cowardly. Ah madam, said Sir Launcelot, an I had wist ye\nwould have been so soon accorded with him I would not have made such\nhaste unto you. Why say ye so, said the queen, do ye forthink yourself\nof your good deeds? Wit you well, said the queen, I accorded never unto\nhim for favour nor love that I had unto him, but for to lay down every\nshameful noise. Madam, said Sir Launcelot, ye understand full well I\nwas never willing nor glad of shameful slander nor noise; and there is\nneither king, queen, nor knight, that beareth the life, except my\nlord King Arthur, and you, madam, should let me, but I should make Sir\nMeliagrance's heart full cold or ever I departed from hence. That wot\nI well, said the queen, but what will ye more? Ye shall have all thing\nruled as ye list to have it. Madam, said Sir Launcelot, so ye be pleased\nI care not, as for my part ye shall soon please.\n\nRight so the queen took Sir Launcelot by the bare hand, for he had put\noff his gauntlet, and so she went with him till her chamber; and then\nshe commanded him to be unarmed. And then Sir Launcelot asked where\nwere the ten knights that were wounded sore; so she showed them unto Sir\nLauncelot, and there they made great joy of the coming of him, and Sir\nLauncelot made great dole of their hurts, and bewailed them greatly. And\nthere Sir Launcelot told them how cowardly and traitorly Meliagrance\nset archers to slay his horse, and how he was fain to put himself in a\nchariot. Thus they complained everych to other; and full fain they would\nhave been revenged, but they peaced themselves because of the queen.\nThen, as the French book saith, Sir Launcelot was called many a day\nafter le Chevaler du Chariot, and did many deeds, and great adventures\nhe had. And so leave we of this tale le Chevaler du Chariot, and turn we\nto this tale.\n\nSo Sir Launcelot had great cheer with the queen, and then Sir Launcelot\nmade a promise with the queen that the same night Sir Launcelot should\ncome to a window outward toward a garden; and that window was y-barred\nwith iron, and there Sir Launcelot promised to meet her when all folks\nwere asleep. So then came Sir Lavaine driving to the gates, crying:\nWhere is my lord, Sir Launcelot du Lake? Then was he sent for, and when\nSir Lavaine saw Sir Launcelot, he said: My lord, I found well how ye\nwere hard bestead, for I have found your horse that was slain with\narrows. As for that, said Sir Launcelot, I pray you, Sir Lavaine, speak\nye of other matters, and let ye this pass, and we shall right it another\ntime when we best may.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. How Sir Launcelot came in the night to the queen and lay\nwith her, and how Sir Meliagrance appeached the queen of treason.\n\n\nTHEN the knights that were hurt were searched, and soft salves were laid\nto their wounds; and so it passed on till supper time, and all the\ncheer that might be made them there was done unto the queen and all her\nknights. Then when season was, they went unto their chambers, but in no\nwise the queen would not suffer the wounded knights to be from her,\nbut that they were laid within draughts by her chamber, upon beds and\npillows, that she herself might see to them, that they wanted nothing.\n\nSo when Sir Launcelot was in his chamber that was assigned unto him, he\ncalled unto him Sir Lavaine, and told him that night he must go speak\nwith his lady, Dame Guenever. Sir, said Sir Lavaine, let me go with you\nan it please you, for I dread me sore of the treason of Sir Meliagrance.\nNay, said Sir Launcelot, I thank you, but I will have nobody with me.\nThen Sir Launcelot took his sword in his hand, and privily went to a\nplace where he had espied a ladder to-forehand, and that he took under\nhis arm, and bare it through the garden, and set it up to the window,\nand there anon the queen was ready to meet him. And then they made\neither to other their complaints of many divers things, and then Sir\nLauncelot wished that he might have come into her. Wit ye well, said\nthe queen, I would as fain as ye, that ye might come in to me. Would ye,\nmadam, said Sir Launcelot, with your heart that I were with you? Yea,\ntruly, said the queen. Now shall I prove my might, said Sir Launcelot,\nfor your love; and then he set his hands upon the bars of iron, and he\npulled at them with such a might that he brast them clean out of the\nstone walls, and therewithal one of the bars of iron cut the brawn of\nhis hands throughout to the bone; and then he leapt into the chamber to\nthe queen. Make ye no noise, said the queen, for my wounded knights lie\nhere fast by me. So, to pass upon this tale, Sir Launcelot went unto\nbed with the queen, and he took no force of his hurt hand, but took his\npleasaunce and his liking until it was in the dawning of the day; and\nwit ye well he slept not but watched, and when he saw his time that he\nmight tarry no longer he took his leave and departed at the window, and\nput it together as well as he might again, and so departed unto his own\nchamber; and there he told Sir Lavaine how he was hurt. Then Sir Lavaine\ndressed his hand and staunched it, and put upon it a glove, that it\nshould not be espied; and so the queen lay long in her bed until it was\nnine of the clock.\n\nThen Sir Meliagrance went to the queen's chamber, and found her ladies\nthere ready clothed. Jesu mercy, said Sir Meliagrance, what aileth you,\nmadam, that ye sleep thus long? And right therewithal he opened the\ncurtain for to behold her; and then was he ware where she lay, and all\nthe sheet and pillow was bebled with the blood of Sir Launcelot and of\nhis hurt hand. When Sir Meliagrance espied that blood, then he deemed in\nher that she was false to the king, and that some of the wounded knights\nhad lain by her all that night. Ah, madam, said Sir Meliagrance, now I\nhave found you a false traitress unto my lord Arthur; for now I prove\nwell it was not for nought that ye laid these wounded knights within the\nbounds of your chamber; therefore I will call you of treason before my\nlord, King Arthur. And now I have proved you, madam, with a shameful\ndeed; and that they be all false, or some of them, I will make good, for\na wounded knight this night hath lain by you. That is false, said\nthe queen, and that I will report me unto them all. Then when the ten\nknights heard Sir Meliagrance's words, they spake all in one voice and\nsaid to Sir Meliagrance: Thou sayest falsely, and wrongfully puttest\nupon us such a deed, and that we will make good any of us; choose which\nthou list of us when we are whole of our wounds. Ye shall not, said Sir\nMeliagrance, away with your proud language, for here ye may all see,\nsaid Sir Meliagrance, that by the queen this night a wounded knight hath\nlain. Then were they all ashamed when they saw that blood; and wit you\nwell Sir Meliagrance was passing glad that he had the queen at such\nan advantage, for he deemed by that to hide his treason. So with this\nrumour came in Sir Launcelot, and found them all at a great array.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. How Sir Launcelot answered for the queen, and waged battle\nagainst Sir Meliagrance; and how Sir Launcelot was taken in a trap\n\n\nWHAT array is this? said Sir Launcelot. Then Sir Meliagrance told them\nwhat he had found, and showed them the queen's bed. Truly, said Sir\nLauncelot, ye did not your part nor knightly, to touch a queen's bed\nwhile it was drawn, and she lying therein; for I dare say my lord Arthur\nhimself would not have displayed her curtains, she being within her bed,\nunless that it had pleased him to have lain down by her; and therefore\nye have done unworshipfully and shamefully to yourself. I wot not what\nye mean, said Sir Meliagrance, but well I am sure there hath one of her\nwounded knights lain by her this night, and therefore I will prove with\nmy hands that she is a traitress unto my lord Arthur. Beware what ye do,\nsaid Launcelot, for an ye say so, an ye will prove it, it will be taken\nat your hands.\n\nMy lord, Sir Launcelot, said Sir Meliagrance, I rede you beware what\nye do; for though ye are never so good a knight, as ye wot well ye are\nrenowned the best knight of the world, yet should ye be advised to do\nbattle in a wrong quarrel, for God will have a stroke in every battle.\nAs for that, said Sir Launcelot, God is to be dread; but as to that I\nsay nay plainly, that this night there lay none of these ten wounded\nknights with my lady Queen Guenever, and that will I prove with my\nhands, that ye say untruly in that now. Hold, said Sir Meliagrance, here\nis my glove that she is traitress unto my lord, King Arthur, and that\nthis night one of the wounded knights lay with her. And I receive your\nglove, said Sir Launcelot. And so they were sealed with their signets,\nand delivered unto the ten knights. At what day shall we do battle\ntogether? said Sir Launcelot. This day eight days, said Sir Meliagrance,\nin the field beside Westminster. I am agreed, said Sir Launcelot. But\nnow, said Sir Meliagrance, sithen it is so that we must fight together,\nI pray you, as ye be a noble knight, await me with no treason, nor\nnone villainy the meanwhile, nor none for you. So God me help, said Sir\nLauncelot, ye shall right well wit I was never of no such conditions,\nfor I report me to all knights that ever have known me, I fared never\nwith no treason, nor I loved never the fellowship of no man that fared\nwith treason. Then let us go to dinner, said Meliagrance, and after\ndinner ye and the queen and ye may ride all to Westminster. I will well,\nsaid Sir Launcelot.\n\nThen Sir Meliagrance said to Sir Launcelot: Pleaseth it you to see the\nestures of this castle? With a good will, said Sir Launcelot. And then\nthey went together from chamber to chamber, for Sir Launcelot dread no\nperils; for ever a man of worship and of prowess dreadeth least always\nperils, for they ween every man be as they be; but ever he that fareth\nwith treason putteth oft a man in great danger. So it befell upon Sir\nLauncelot that no peril dread, as he went with Sir Meliagrance he trod\non a trap and the board rolled, and there Sir Launcelot fell down more\nthan ten fathom into a cave full of straw; and then Sir Meliagrance\ndeparted and made no fare as that he nist where he was.\n\nAnd when Sir Launcelot was thus missed they marvelled where he was\nbecome; and then the queen and many of them deemed that he was departed\nas he was wont to do suddenly. For Sir Meliagrance made suddenly to put\naway aside Sir Lavaine's horse, that they might all understand that Sir\nLauncelot was departed suddenly. So it passed on till after dinner; and\nthen Sir Lavaine would not stint until that he ordained litters for the\nwounded knights, that they might be laid in them; and so with the\nqueen and them all, both ladies and gentlewomen and other, went unto\nWestminster; and there the knights told King Arthur how Meliagrance had\nappealed the queen of high treason, and how Sir Launcelot had received\nthe glove of him: And this day eight days they shall do battle afore\nyou. By my head, said King Arthur, I am afeard Sir Meliagrance hath\ntaken upon him a great charge; but where is Sir Launcelot? said the\nking. Sir, said they all, we wot not where he is, but we deem he is\nridden to some adventures, as he is ofttimes wont to do, for he hath Sir\nLavaine's horse. Let him be, said the king, he will be founden, but if\nhe be trapped with some treason.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. How Sir Launcelot was delivered out of prison by a lady,\nand took a white courser and came for to keep his day.\n\n\nSO leave we Sir Launcelot lying within that cave in great pain; and\nevery day there came a lady and brought him his meat and his drink,\nand wooed him, to have lain by him; and ever the noble knight, Sir\nLauncelot, said her nay. Sir Launcelot, said she, ye are not wise, for\nye may never out of this prison, but if ye have my help; and also your\nlady, Queen Guenever, shall be brent in your default, unless that ye\nbe there at the day of battle. God defend, said Sir Launcelot, that she\nshould be brent in my default; and if it be so, said Sir Launcelot, that\nI may not be there, it shall be well understanded, both at the king and\nat the queen, and with all men of worship, that I am dead, sick, outher\nin prison. For all men that know me will say for me that I am in some\nevil case an I be not there that day; and well I wot there is some good\nknight either of my blood, or some other that loveth me, that will take\nmy quarrel in hand; and therefore, said Sir Launcelot, wit ye well ye\nshall not fear me; and if there were no more women in all this land but\nye, I will not have ado with you. Then art thou shamed, said the lady,\nand destroyed for ever. As for world's shame, Jesu defend me, and as for\nmy distress, it is welcome whatsoever it be that God sendeth me.\n\nSo she came to him the same day that the battle should be, and said:\nSir Launcelot, methinketh ye are too hard-hearted, but wouldest thou but\nkiss me once I should deliver thee, and thine armour, and the best horse\nthat is within Sir Meliagrance's stable. As for to kiss you, said Sir\nLauncelot, I may do that and lose no worship; and wit ye well an I\nunderstood there were any disworship for to kiss you I would not do it.\nThen he kissed her, and then she gat him, and brought him to his armour.\nAnd when he was armed, she brought him to a stable, where stood twelve\ngood coursers, and bade him choose the best. Then Sir Launcelot looked\nupon a white courser the which liked him best; and anon he commanded the\nkeepers fast to saddle him with the best saddle of war that there was;\nand so it was done as he bade. Then gat he his spear in his hand, and\nhis sword by his side, and commended the lady unto God, and said: Lady,\nfor this good deed I shall do you service if ever it be in my power.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. How Sir Launcelot came the same time that Sir Meliagrance\nabode him in the field and dressed him to battle.\n\n\nNOW leave we Sir Launcelot wallop all that he might, and speak we\nof Queen Guenever that was brought to a fire to be brent; for Sir\nMeliagrance was sure, him thought, that Sir Launcelot should not be at\nthat battle; therefore he ever cried upon King Arthur to do him justice,\nother-else bring forth Sir Launcelot du Lake. Then was the king and all\nthe court full sore abashed and shamed that the queen should be brent in\nthe default of Sir Launcelot. My lord Arthur, said Sir Lavaine, ye may\nunderstand that it is not well with my lord Sir Launcelot, for an he\nwere alive, so he be not sick outher in prison, wit ye well he would be\nhere; for never heard ye that ever he failed his part for whom he should\ndo battle for. And therefore, said Sir Lavaine, my lord, King Arthur, I\nbeseech you give me license to do battle here this day for my lord and\nmaster, and for to save my lady, the queen. Gramercy gentle Sir Lavaine,\nsaid King Arthur, for I dare say all that Sir Meliagrance putteth upon\nmy lady the queen is wrong, for I have spoken with all the ten wounded\nknights, and there is not one of them, an he were whole and able to do\nbattle, but he would prove upon Sir Meliagrance's body that it is false\nthat he putteth upon my queen. So shall I, said Sir Lavaine, in the\ndefence of my lord, Sir Launcelot, an ye will give me leave. Now I give\nyou leave, said King Arthur, and do your best, for I dare well say there\nis some treason done to Sir Launcelot.\n\nThen was Sir Lavaine armed and horsed, and suddenly at the lists' end he\nrode to perform this battle; and right as the heralds should cry: Lesses\nles aler, right so came in Sir Launcelot driving with all the force of\nhis horse. And then Arthur cried: Ho! and Abide! Then was Sir Launcelot\ncalled on horseback to-fore King Arthur, and there he told openly\nto-fore the king and all, how Sir Meliagrance had served him first to\nlast. And when the king, and the queen, and all the lords, knew of the\ntreason of Sir Meliagrance they were all ashamed on his behalf. Then\nwas Queen Guenever sent for, and set by the king in great trust of her\nchampion. And then there was no more else to say, but Sir Launcelot and\nSir Meliagrance dressed them unto battle, and took their spears; and\nso they came together as thunder, and there Sir Launcelot bare him\ndown quite over his horse's croup. And then Sir Launcelot alighted and\ndressed his shield on his shoulder, with his sword in his hand, and Sir\nMeliagrance in the same wise dressed him unto him, and there they smote\nmany great strokes together; and at the last Sir Launcelot smote him\nsuch a buffet upon the helmet that he fell on the one side to the earth.\nAnd then he cried upon him aloud: Most noble knight, Sir Launcelot du\nLake, save my life, for I yield me unto you, and I require you, as ye be\na knight and fellow of the Table Round, slay me not, for I yield me as\novercome; and whether I shall live or die I put me in the king's hands\nand yours.\n\nThen Sir Launcelot wist not what to do, for he had had liefer than all\nthe good of the world he might have been revenged upon Sir Meliagrance;\nand Sir Launcelot looked up to the Queen Guenever, if he might espy by\nany sign or countenance what she would have done. And then the queen\nwagged her head upon Sir Launcelot, as though she would say: Slay him.\nFull well knew Sir Launcelot by the wagging of her head that she would\nhave him dead; then Sir Launcelot bade him rise for shame and perform\nthat battle to the utterance. Nay, said Sir Meliagrance, I will never\narise until ye take me as yolden and recreant. I shall proffer you large\nproffers, said Sir Launcelot, that is for to say, I shall unarm my head\nand my left quarter of my body, all that may be unarmed, and let bind my\nleft hand behind me, so that it shall not help me, and right so I shall\ndo battle with you. Then Sir Meliagrance started up upon his legs, and\nsaid on high: My lord Arthur, take heed to this proffer, for I will take\nit, and let him be disarmed and bounden according to his proffer. What\nsay ye, said King Arthur unto Sir Launcelot, will ye abide by your\nproffer? Yea, my lord, said Sir Launcelot, I will never go from that I\nhave once said.\n\nThen the knights parters of the field disarmed Sir Launcelot, first his\nhead, and sithen his left arm, and his left side, and they bound his\nleft arm behind his back, without shield or anything, and then they were\nput together. Wit you well there was many a lady and knight marvelled\nthat Sir Launcelot would jeopardy himself in such wise. Then Sir\nMeliagrance came with his sword all on high, and Sir Launcelot showed\nhim openly his bare head and the bare left side; and when he weened to\nhave smitten him upon the bare head, then lightly he avoided the left\nleg and the left side, and put his right hand and his sword to that\nstroke, and so put it on side with great sleight; and then with great\nforce Sir Launcelot smote him on the helmet such a buffet that the\nstroke carved the head in two parts. Then there was no more to do, but\nhe was drawn out of the field. And at the great instance of the knights\nof the Table Round, the king suffered him to be interred, and the\nmention made upon him, who slew him, and for what cause he was slain;\nand then the king and the queen made more of Sir Launcelot du Lake, and\nmore he was cherished, than ever he was aforehand.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. How Sir Urre came into Arthur's court for to be healed of his\nwounds, and how King Arthur would begin to handle him.\n\n\nTHEN as the French book maketh mention, there was a good knight in\nthe land of Hungary, his name was Sir Urre, and he was an adventurous\nknight, and in all places where he might hear of any deeds of worship\nthere would he be. So it happened in Spain there was an earl's son, his\nname was Alphegus, and at a great tournament in Spain this Sir Urre,\nknight of Hungary, and Sir Alphegus of Spain encountered together\nfor very envy; and so either undertook other to the utterance. And by\nfortune Sir Urre slew Sir Alphegus, the earl's son of Spain, but this\nknight that was slain had given Sir Urre, or ever he was slain, seven\ngreat wounds, three on the head, and four on his body and upon his\nleft hand. And this Sir Alphegus had a mother, the which was a great\nsorceress; and she, for the despite of her son's death, wrought by her\nsubtle crafts that Sir Urre should never be whole, but ever his wounds\nshould one time fester and another time bleed, so that he should never\nbe whole until the best knight of the world had searched his wounds; and\nthus she made her avaunt, wherethrough it was known that Sir Urre should\nnever be whole.\n\nThen his mother let make an horse litter, and put him therein under\ntwo palfreys; and then she took Sir Urre's sister with him, a full fair\ndamosel, whose name was Felelolie; and then she took a page with him to\nkeep their horses, and so they led Sir Urre through many countries. For\nas the French book saith, she led him so seven year through all lands\nchristened, and never she could find no knight that might ease her son.\nSo she came into Scotland and into the lands of England, and by fortune\nshe came nigh the feast of Pentecost until King Arthur's court, that at\nthat time was holden at Carlisle. And when she came there, then she made\nit openly to be known how that she was come into that land for to heal\nher son.\n\nThen King Arthur let call that lady, and asked her the cause why she\nbrought that hurt knight into that land. My most noble king, said that\nlady, wit you well I brought him hither for to be healed of his wounds,\nthat of all this seven year he might not be whole. And then she told\nthe king where he was wounded, and of whom; and how his mother had\ndiscovered in her pride how she had wrought that by enchantment, so that\nhe should never be whole until the best knight of the world had searched\nhis wounds. And so I have passed through all the lands christened to\nhave him healed, except this land. And if I fail to heal him here in\nthis land, I will never take more pain upon me, and that is pity, for he\nwas a good knight, and of great nobleness. What is his name? said Arthur\nMy good and gracious lord, she said, his name is Sir Urre of the Mount.\nIn good time, said the king, and sith ye are come into this land, ye are\nright welcome; and wit you well here shall your son be healed, an ever\nany Christian man may heal him. And for to give all other men of worship\ncourage, I myself will assay to handle your son, and so shall all the\nkings, dukes, and earls that be here present with me at this time;\nthereto will I command them, and well I wot they shall obey and do after\nmy commandment. And wit you well, said King Arthur unto Urre's sister, I\nshall begin to handle him, and search unto my power, not presuming upon\nme that I am so worthy to heal your son by my deeds, but I will courage\nother men of worship to do as I will do. And then the king commanded all\nthe kings, dukes, and earls, and all noble knights of the Round Table\nthat were there that time present, to come into the meadow of Carlisle.\nAnd so at that time there were but an hundred and ten of the Round\nTable, for forty knights were that time away; and so here we must begin\nat King Arthur, as is kindly to begin at him that was the most man of\nworship that was christened at that time.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. How King Arthur handled Sir Urre, and after him many other\nknights of the Round Table.\n\n\nTHEN King Arthur looked upon Sir Urre, and the king thought he was a\nfull likely man when he was whole; and then King Arthur made him to be\ntaken down off the litter and laid him upon the earth, and there was\nlaid a cushion of gold that he should kneel upon. And then noble Arthur\nsaid: Fair knight, me repenteth of thy hurt, and for to courage all\nother noble knights I will pray thee softly to suffer me to handle your\nwounds. Most noble christened king, said Urre, do as ye list, for I\nam at the mercy of God, and at your commandment. So then Arthur softly\nhandled him, and then some of his wounds renewed upon bleeding. Then the\nKing Clarence of Northumberland searched, and it would not be. And then\nSir Barant le Apres that was called the King with the Hundred Knights,\nhe assayed and failed; and so did King Uriens of the land of Gore; so\ndid King Anguish of Ireland; so did King Nentres of Garloth; so did King\nCarados of Scotland; so did the Duke Galahad, the haut prince; so did\nConstantine, that was Sir Carados' son of Cornwall; so did Duke Chaleins\nof Clarance; so did the Earl Ulbause; so did the Earl Lambaile; so did\nthe Earl Aristause.\n\nThen came in Sir Gawaine with his three sons, Sir Gingalin, Sir\nFlorence, and Sir Lovel, these two were begotten upon Sir Brandiles'\nsister; and all they failed. Then came in Sir Agravaine, Sir Gaheris,\nSir Mordred, and the good knight, Sir Gareth, that was of very\nknighthood worth all the brethren. So came knights of Launcelot's kin,\nbut Sir Launcelot was not that time in the court, for he was that time\nupon his adventures. Then Sir Lionel, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir Bors de\nGanis, Sir Blamore de Ganis, Sir Bleoberis de Ganis, Sir Gahalantine,\nSir Galihodin, Sir Menaduke, Sir Villiars the Valiant, Sir Hebes le\nRenoumes. All these were of Sir Launcelot's kin, and all they failed.\nThen came in Sir Sagramore le Desirous, Sir Dodinas le Savage, Sir\nDinadan, Sir Bruin le Noire, that Sir Kay named La Cote Male Taile, and\nSir Kay le Seneschal, Sir Kay de Stranges, Sir Meliot de Logris, Sir\nPetipase of Winchelsea, Sir Galleron of Galway, Sir Melion of the\nMountain, Sir Cardok, Sir Uwaine les Avoutres, and Sir Ozanna le Cure\nHardy.\n\nThen came in Sir Astamor, and Sir Gromere, Grummor's son, Sir Crosselm,\nSir Servause le Breuse, that was called a passing strong knight, for\nas the book saith, the chief Lady of the Lake feasted Sir Launcelot and\nServause le Breuse, and when she had feasted them both at sundry times\nshe prayed them to give her a boon. And they granted it her. And then\nshe prayed Sir Servause that he would promise her never to do battle\nagainst Sir Launcelot du Lake, and in the same wise she prayed Sir\nLauncelot never to do battle against Sir Servause, and so either\npromised her. For the French book saith, that Sir Servause had never\ncourage nor lust to do battle against no man, but if it were against\ngiants, and against dragons, and wild beasts. So we pass unto them that\nat the king's request made them all that were there at that high feast,\nas of the knights of the Table Round, for to search Sir Urre: to that\nintent the king did it, to wit which was the noblest knight among them.\n\nThen came Sir Aglovale, Sir Durnore, Sir Tor, that was begotten upon\nAries, the cowherd's wife, but he was begotten afore Aries wedded her,\nand King Pellinore begat them all, first Sir Tor, Sir Aglovale, Sir\nDurnore, Sir Lamorak, the most noblest knight one that ever was in\nArthur's days as for a worldly knight, and Sir Percivale that was\npeerless except Sir Galahad in holy deeds, but they died in the quest\nof the Sangreal. Then came Sir Griflet le Fise de Dieu, Sir Lucan the\nButler, Sir Bedevere his brother, Sir Brandiles, Sir Constantine, Sir\nCador's son of Cornwall, that was king after Arthur's days, and Sir\nClegis, Sir Sadok, Sir Dinas le Seneschal of Cornwall, Sir Fergus,\nSir Driant, Sir Lambegus, Sir Clarrus of Cleremont, Sir Cloddrus, Sir\nHectimere, Sir Edward of Carnarvon, Sir Dinas, Sir Priamus, that was\nchristened by Sir Tristram the noble knight, and these three were\nbrethren; Sir Hellaine le Blank that was son to Sir Bors, he begat\nhim upon King Brandegoris' daughter, and Sir Brian de Listinoise;\nSir Gautere, Sir Reynold, Sir Gillemere, were three brethren that Sir\nLauncelot won upon a bridge in Sir Kay's arms. Sir Guyart le Petite, Sir\nBellangere le Beuse, that was son to the good knight, Sir Alisander le\nOrphelin, that was slain by the treason of King Mark. Also that traitor\nking slew the noble knight Sir Tristram, as he sat harping afore his\nlady La Beale Isoud, with a trenchant glaive, for whose death was much\nbewailing of every knight that ever were in Arthur's days; there was\nnever none so bewailed as was Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak, for they\nwere traitorously slain, Sir Tristram by King Mark, and Sir Lamorak by\nSir Gawaine and his brethren. And this Sir Bellangere revenged the death\nof his father Alisander, and Sir Tristram slew King Mark, and La Beale\nIsoud died swooning upon the corse of Sir Tristram, whereof was great\npity. And all that were with King Mark that were consenting to the death\nof Sir Tristram were slain, as Sir Andred and many other.\n\nThen came Sir Hebes, Sir Morganore, Sir Sentraile, Sir Suppinabilis, Sir\nBellangere le Orgulous, that the good knight Sir Lamorak won in plain\nbattle; Sir Neroveus and Sir Plenorius, two good knights that Sir\nLauncelot won; Sir Darras, Sir Harry le Fise Lake, Sir Erminide, brother\nto King Hermaunce, for whom Sir Palomides fought at the Red City with\ntwo brethren; and Sir Selises of the Dolorous Tower, Sir Edward of\nOrkney, Sir Ironside, that was called the noble Knight of the Red Launds\nthat Sir Gareth won for the love of Dame Liones, Sir Arrok de Grevaunt,\nSir Degrane Saunce Velany that fought with the giant of the black lowe,\nSir Epinogris, that was the king's son of Northumberland. Sir Pelleas\nthat loved the lady Ettard, and he had died for her love had not been\none of the ladies of the lake, her name was Dame Nimue, and she wedded\nSir Pelleas, and she saved him that he was never slain, and he was a\nfull noble knight; and Sir Lamiel of Cardiff that was a great lover. Sir\nPlaine de Fors, Sir Melleaus de Lile, Sir Bohart le Cure Hardy that was\nKing Arthur's son, Sir Mador de la Porte, Sir Colgrevance, Sir Hervise\nde la Forest Savage, Sir Marrok, the good knight that was betrayed with\nhis wife, for she made him seven year a wer-wolf, Sir Persaunt, Sir\nPertilope, his brother, that was called the Green Knight, and Sir\nPerimones, brother to them both, that was called the Red Knight, that\nSir Gareth won when he was called Beaumains. All these hundred knights\nand ten searched Sir Urre's wounds by the commandment of King Arthur.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. How Sir Launcelot was commanded by Arthur to handle his\nwounds, and anon he was all whole, and how they thanked God.\n\n\nMERCY Jesu, said King Arthur, where is Sir Launcelot du Lake that he\nis not here at this time? Thus, as they stood and spake of many things,\nthere was espied Sir Launcelot that came riding toward them, and told\nthe king. Peace, said the king, let no manner thing be said until he be\ncome to us. So when Sir Launcelot espied King Arthur, he descended from\nhis horse and came to the king, and saluted him and them all. Anon as\nthe maid, Sir Urre's sister, saw Sir Launcelot, she ran to her brother\nthereas he lay in his litter, and said: Brother, here is come a knight\nthat my heart giveth greatly unto. Fair sister, said Sir Urre, so doth\nmy heart light against him, and certainly I hope now to be healed, for\nmy heart giveth unto him more than to all these that have searched me.\n\nThen said Arthur unto Sir Launcelot: Ye must do as we have done; and\ntold Sir Launcelot what they had done, and showed him them all, that had\nsearched him. Jesu defend me, said Sir Launcelot, when so many kings\nand knights have assayed and failed, that I should presume upon me to\nenchieve that all ye, my lords, might not enchieve. Ye shall not choose,\nsaid King Arthur, for I will command you for to do as we all have done.\nMy most renowned lord, said Sir Launcelot, ye know well I dare not nor\nmay not disobey your commandment, but an I might or durst, wit you well\nI would not take upon me to touch that wounded knight in that intent\nthat I should pass all other knights; Jesu defend me from that shame. Ye\ntake it wrong, said King Arthur, ye shall not do it for no presumption,\nbut for to bear us fellowship, insomuch ye be a fellow of the Table\nRound; and wit you well, said King Arthur, an ye prevail not and heal\nhim, I dare say there is no knight in this land may heal him, and\ntherefore I pray you, do as we have done.\n\nAnd then all the kings and knights for the most part prayed Sir\nLauncelot to search him; and then the wounded knight, Sir Urre, set him\nup weakly, and prayed Sir Launcelot heartily, saying: Courteous knight,\nI require thee for God's sake heal my wounds, for methinketh ever\nsithen ye came here my wounds grieve me not. Ah, my fair lord, said\nSir Launcelot, Jesu would that I might help you; I shame me sore that I\nshould be thus rebuked, for never was I able in worthiness to do so high\na thing. Then Sir Launcelot kneeled down by the wounded knight saying:\nMy lord Arthur, I must do your commandment, the which is sore against my\nheart. And then he held up his hands, and looked into the east, saying\nsecretly unto himself: Thou blessed Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, I\nbeseech thee of thy mercy, that my simple worship and honesty be saved,\nand thou blessed Trinity, thou mayst give power to heal this sick knight\nby thy great virtue and grace of thee, but, Good Lord, never of myself.\nAnd then Sir Launcelot prayed Sir Urre to let him see his head; and\nthen devoutly kneeling he ransacked the three wounds, that they bled a\nlittle, and forthwith all the wounds fair healed, and seemed as they had\nbeen whole a seven year. And in likewise he searched his body of other\nthree wounds, and they healed in likewise; and then the last of all he\nsearched the which was in his hand, and anon it healed fair.\n\nThen King Arthur and all the kings and knights kneeled down and gave\nthankings and lovings unto God and to His Blessed Mother. And ever Sir\nLauncelot wept as he had been a child that had been beaten. Then King\nArthur let array priests and clerks in the most devoutest manner, to\nbring in Sir Urre within Carlisle, with singing and loving to God. And\nwhen this was done, the king let clothe him in the richest manner that\ncould be thought; and then were there but few better made knights in all\nthe court, for he was passingly well made and bigly; and Arthur asked\nSir Urre how he felt himself. My good lord, he said, I felt myself never\nso lusty. Will ye joust and do deeds of arms? said King Arthur. Sir,\nsaid Urre, an I had all that longed unto jousts I would be soon ready.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. How there was a party made of an hundred knights against\nan hundred knights, and of other matters.\n\n\nTHEN Arthur made a party of hundred knights to be against an hundred\nknights. And so upon the morn they jousted for a diamond, but there\njousted none of the dangerous knights; and so for to shorten this tale,\nSir Urre and Sir Lavaine jousted best that day, for there was none of\nthem but he overthrew and pulled down thirty knights; and then by the\nassent of all the kings and lords, Sir Urre and Sir Lavaine were made\nknights of the Table Round. And Sir Lavaine cast his love unto Dame\nFelelolie, Sir Urre's sister, and then they were wedded together with\ngreat joy, and King Arthur gave to everych of them a barony of lands.\nAnd this Sir Urre would never go from Sir Launcelot, but he and Sir\nLavaine awaited evermore upon him; and they were in all the court\naccounted for good knights, and full desirous in arms; and many noble\ndeeds they did, for they would have no rest, but ever sought adventures.\n\nThus they lived in all that court with great noblesse and joy long time.\nBut every night and day Sir Agravaine, Sir Gawaine's brother, awaited\nQueen Guenever and Sir Launcelot du Lake to put them to a rebuke and\nshame. And so I leave here of this tale, and overskip great books of Sir\nLauncelot du Lake, what great adventures he did when he was called Le\nChevaler du Chariot. For as the French book saith, because of despite\nthat knights and ladies called him the knight that rode in the chariot\nlike as he were judged to the gallows, therefore in despite of all them\nthat named him so, he was carried in a chariot a twelvemonth, for, but\nlittle after that he had slain Sir Meliagrance in the queen's quarrel,\nhe never in a twelvemonth came on horseback. And as the French book\nsaith, he did that twelvemonth more than forty battles. And because I\nhave lost the very matter of Le Chevaier du Chariot, I depart from the\ntale of Sir Launcelot, and here I go unto the morte of King Arthur; and\nthat caused Sir Agravaine.\n\n_Explicit liber xix. And hereafter followeth the most piteous history of\nthe morte of King Arthur, the which is the twentieth book._\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XX.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. How Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred were busy upon Sir Gawaine\nfor to disclose the love between Sir Launcelot and Queen Guenever.\n\n\nIN May when every lusty heart flourisheth and bourgeoneth, for as the\nseason is lusty to behold and comfortable, so man and woman rejoice and\ngladden of summer coming with his fresh flowers: for winter with his\nrough winds and blasts causeth a lusty man and woman to cower and sit\nfast by the fire. So in this season, as in the month of May, it befell\na great anger and unhap that stinted not till the flower of chivalry of\nall the world was destroyed and slain; and all was long upon two unhappy\nknights the which were named Agravaine and Sir Mordred, that were\nbrethren unto Sir Gawaine. For this Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred had\never a privy hate unto the queen Dame Guenever and to Sir Launcelot, and\ndaily and nightly they ever watched upon Sir Launcelot.\n\nSo it mishapped, Sir Gawaine and all his brethren were in King Arthur's\nchamber; and then Sir Agravaine said thus openly, and not in no counsel,\nthat many knights might hear it: I marvel that we all be not ashamed\nboth to see and to know how Sir Launcelot lieth daily and nightly by the\nqueen, and all we know it so; and it is shamefully suffered of us all,\nthat we all should suffer so noble a king as King Arthur is so to be\nshamed.\n\nThen spake Sir Gawaine, and said: Brother Sir Agravaine, I pray you and\ncharge you move no such matters no more afore me, for wit you well, said\nSir Gawaine, I will not be of your counsel. So God me help, said Sir\nGaheris and Sir Gareth, we will not be knowing, brother Agravaine, of\nyour deeds. Then will I, said Sir Mordred. I lieve well that, said Sir\nGawaine, for ever unto all unhappiness, brother Sir Mordred, thereto\nwill ye grant; and I would that ye left all this, and made you not so\nbusy, for I know, said Sir Gawaine, what will fall of it. Fall of it\nwhat fall may, said Sir Agravaine, I will disclose it to the king. Not\nby my counsel, said Sir Gawaine, for an there rise war and wrack betwixt\nSir Launcelot and us, wit you well brother, there will many kings and\ngreat lords hold with Sir Launcelot. Also, brother Sir Agravaine, said\nSir Gawaine, ye must remember how ofttimes Sir Launcelot hath rescued\nthe king and the queen; and the best of us all had been full cold at the\nheart-root had not Sir Launcelot been better than we, and that hath he\nproved himself full oft. And as for my part, said Sir Gawaine, I will\nnever be against Sir Launcelot for one day's deed, when he rescued me\nfrom King Carados of the Dolorous Tower, and slew him, and saved my\nlife. Also, brother Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred, in like wise Sir\nLauncelot rescued you both, and threescore and two, from Sir Turquin.\nMethinketh brother, such kind deeds and kindness should be remembered.\nDo as ye list, said Sir Agravaine, for I will lain it no longer. With\nthese words came to them King Arthur. Now brother, stint your noise,\nsaid Sir Gawaine. We will not, said Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred. Will\nye so? said Sir Gawaine; then God speed you, for I will not hear your\ntales ne be of your counsel. No more will I, said Sir Gareth and Sir\nGaheris, for we will never say evil by that man; for because, said Sir\nGareth, Sir Launcelot made me knight, by no manner owe I to say ill of\nhim: and therewithal they three departed, making great dole. Alas, said\nSir Gawaine and Sir Gareth, now is this realm wholly mischieved, and\nthe noble fellowship of the Round Table shall be disparpled: so they\ndeparted.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. How Sir Agravaine disclosed their love to King Arthur, and\nhow King Arthur gave them licence to take him.\n\n\nAND then Sir Arthur asked them what noise they made. My lord, said\nAgravaine, I shall tell you that I may keep no longer. Here is I, and\nmy brother Sir Mordred, brake unto my brothers Sir Gawaine, Sir Gaheris,\nand to Sir Gareth, how this we know all, that Sir Launcelot holdeth\nyour queen, and hath done long; and we be your sister's sons, and we\nmay suffer it no longer, and all we wot that ye should be above Sir\nLauncelot; and ye are the king that made him knight, and therefore we\nwill prove it, that he is a traitor to your person.\n\nIf it be so, said Sir Arthur, wit you well he is none other, but I would\nbe loath to begin such a thing but I might have proofs upon it; for\nSir Launcelot is an hardy knight, and all ye know he is the best knight\namong us all; and but if he be taken with the deed, he will fight with\nhim that bringeth up the noise, and I know no knight that is able to\nmatch him. Therefore an it be sooth as ye say, I would he were taken\nwith the deed. For as the French book saith, the king was full loath\nthereto, that any noise should be upon Sir Launcelot and his queen; for\nthe king had a deeming, but he would not hear of it, for Sir Launcelot\nhad done so much for him and the queen so many times, that wit ye well\nthe king loved him passingly well. My lord, said Sir Agravaine, ye shall\nride to-morn a-hunting, and doubt ye not Sir Launcelot will not go with\nyou. Then when it draweth toward night, ye may send the queen word that\nye will lie out all that night, and so may ye send for your cooks, and\nthen upon pain of death we shall take him that night with the queen, and\nouther we shall bring him to you dead or quick. I will well, said the\nking; then I counsel you, said the king, take with you sure fellowship.\nSir, said Agravaine, my brother, Sir Mordred, and I, will take with us\ntwelve knights of the Round Table. Beware, said King Arthur, for I warn\nyou ye shall find him wight. Let us deal, said Sir Agravaine and Sir\nMordred.\n\nSo on the morn King Arthur rode a-hunting, and sent word to the queen\nthat he would be out all that night. Then Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred\ngat to them twelve knights, and hid themself in a chamber in the Castle\nof Carlisle, and these were their names: Sir Colgrevance, Sir Mador\nde la Porte, Sir Gingaline, Sir Meliot de Logris, Sir Petipase of\nWinchelsea, Sir Galleron of Galway, Sir Melion of the Mountain, Sir\nAstamore, Sir Gromore Somir Joure, Sir Curselaine, Sir Florence, Sir\nLovel. So these twelve knights were with Sir Mordred and Sir Agravaine,\nand all they were of Scotland, outher of Sir Gawaine's kin, either\nwell-willers to his brethren.\n\nSo when the night came, Sir Launcelot told Sir Bors how he would go that\nnight and speak with the queen. Sir, said Sir Bors, ye shall not go\nthis night by my counsel. Why? said Sir Launcelot. Sir, said Sir Bors,\nI dread me ever of Sir Agravaine, that waiteth you daily to do you shame\nand us all; and never gave my heart against no going, that ever ye went\nto the queen, so much as now; for I mistrust that the king is out this\nnight from the queen because peradventure he hath lain some watch for\nyou and the queen, and therefore I dread me sore of treason. Have ye no\ndread, said Sir Launcelot, for I shall go and come again, and make no\ntarrying. Sir, said Sir Bors, that me repenteth, for I dread me sore\nthat your going out this night shall wrath us all. Fair nephew, said Sir\nLauncelot, I marvel much why ye say thus, sithen the queen hath sent\nfor me; and wit ye well I will not be so much a coward, but she shall\nunderstand I will see her good grace. God speed you well, said Sir Bors,\nand send you sound and safe again.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. How Sir Launcelot was espied in the queen's chamber, and how Sir\nAgravaine and Sir Mordred came with twelve knights to slay him.\n\n\nSO Sir Launcelot departed, and took his sword under his arm, and so in\nhis mantle that noble knight put himself in great Jeopardy; and so he\npassed till he came to the queen's chamber, and then Sir Launcelot was\nlightly put into the chamber. And then, as the French book saith, the\nqueen and Launcelot were together. And whether they were abed or at\nother manner of disports, me list not hereof make no mention, for love\nthat time was not as is now-a-days. But thus as they were together,\nthere came Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred, with twelve knights with them\nof the Round Table, and they said with crying voice: Traitor-knight, Sir\nLauncelot du Lake, now art thou taken. And thus they cried with a loud\nvoice, that all the court might hear it; and they all fourteen were\narmed at all points as they should fight in a battle. Alas said Queen\nGuenever, now are we mischieved both Madam, said Sir Launcelot, is there\nhere any armour within your chamber, that I might cover my poor body\nwithal? An if there be any give it me, and I shall soon stint their\nmalice, by the grace of God. Truly, said the queen, I have none armour,\nshield, sword, nor spear; wherefore I dread me sore our long love is\ncome to a mischievous end, for I hear by their noise there be many noble\nknights, and well I wot they be surely armed, and against them ye may\nmake no resistance. Wherefore ye are likely to be slain, and then shall\nI be brent. For an ye might escape them, said the queen, I would not\ndoubt but that ye would rescue me in what danger that ever I stood in.\nAlas, said Sir Launcelot, in all my life thus was I never bestead, that\nI should be thus shamefully slain for lack of mine armour.\n\nBut ever in one Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred cried: Traitor-knight,\ncome out of the queen's chamber, for wit thou well thou art so beset\nthat thou shalt not escape. O Jesu mercy, said Sir Launcelot, this\nshameful cry and noise I may not suffer, for better were death at once\nthan thus to endure this pain. Then he took the queen in his arms, and\nkissed her, and said: Most noble Christian queen, I beseech you as ye\nhave been ever my special good lady, and I at all times your true poor\nknight unto my power, and as I never failed you in right nor in wrong\nsithen the first day King Arthur made me knight, that ye will pray for\nmy soul if that I here be slain; for well I am assured that Sir Bors,\nmy nephew, and all the remnant of my kin, with Sir Lavaine and Sir Urre,\nthat they will not fail you to rescue you from the fire; and therefore,\nmine own lady, recomfort yourself, whatsomever come of me, that ye go\nwith Sir Bors, my nephew, and Sir Urre, and they all will do you all the\npleasure that they can or may, that ye shall live like a queen upon my\nlands. Nay, Launcelot, said the queen, wit thou well I will never live\nafter thy days, but an thou be slain I will take my death as meekly for\nJesu Christ's sake as ever did any Christian queen. Well, madam, said\nLauncelot, sith it is so that the day is come that our love must\ndepart, wit you well I shall sell my life as dear as I may; and a\nthousandfold, said Sir Launcelot, I am more heavier for you than for\nmyself. And now I had liefer than to be lord of all Christendom, that I\nhad sure armour upon me, that men might speak of my deeds or ever I were\nslain. Truly, said the queen, I would an it might please God that they\nwould take me and slay me, and suffer you to escape. That shall never\nbe, said Sir Launcelot, God defend me from such a shame, but Jesu be\nThou my shield and mine armour!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. How Sir Launcelot slew Sir Colgrevance, and armed him in his\nharness, and after slew Sir Agravaine, and twelve of his fellows.\n\n\nAND therewith Sir Launcelot wrapped his mantle about his arm well and\nsurely; and by then they had gotten a great form out of the hall, and\ntherewithal they rashed at the door. Fair lords, said Sir Launcelot,\nleave your noise and your rashing, and I shall set open this door, and\nthen may ye do with me what it liketh you. Come off then, said they\nall, and do it, for it availeth thee not to strive against us all; and\ntherefore let us into this chamber, and we shall save thy life until\nthou come to King Arthur. Then Launcelot unbarred the door, and with his\nleft hand he held it open a little, so that but one man might come in\nat once; and so there came striding a good knight, a much man and large,\nand his name was Colgrevance of Gore, and he with a sword struck at Sir\nLauncelot mightily; and he put aside the stroke, and gave him such a\nbuffet upon the helmet, that he fell grovelling dead within the chamber\ndoor. And then Sir Launcelot with great might drew that dead knight\nwithin the chamber door; and Sir Launcelot with help of the queen and\nher ladies was lightly armed in Sir Colgrevance's armour.\n\nAnd ever stood Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred crying: Traitor-knight,\ncome out of the queen's chamber. Leave your noise, said Sir Launcelot\nunto Sir Agravaine, for wit you well, Sir Agravaine, ye shall not prison\nme this night; and therefore an ye do by my counsel, go ye all from this\nchamber door, and make not such crying and such manner of slander as ye\ndo; for I promise you by my knighthood, an ye will depart and make no\nmore noise, I shall as to-morn appear afore you all before the king,\nand then let it be seen which of you all, outher else ye all, that will\naccuse me of treason; and there I shall answer you as a knight should,\nthat hither I came to the queen for no manner of mal engin, and that\nwill I prove and make it good upon you with my hands. Fie on thee,\ntraitor, said Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred, we will have thee maugre\nthy head, and slay thee if we list; for we let thee wit we have the\nchoice of King Arthur to save thee or to slay thee. Ah sirs, said Sir\nLauncelot, is there none other grace with you? then keep yourself.\n\nSo then Sir Launcelot set all open the chamber door, and mightily and\nknightly he strode in amongst them; and anon at the first buffet he slew\nSir Agravaine. And twelve of his fellows after, within a little while\nafter, he laid them cold to the earth, for there was none of the twelve\nthat might stand Sir Launcelot one buffet. Also Sir Launcelot wounded\nSir Mordred, and he fled with all his might. And then Sir Launcelot\nreturned again unto the queen, and said: Madam, now wit you well all our\ntrue love is brought to an end, for now will King Arthur ever be my\nfoe; and therefore, madam, an it like you that I may have you with me,\nI shall save you from all manner adventures dangerous. That is not best,\nsaid the queen; meseemeth now ye have done so much harm, it will be best\nye hold you still with this. And if ye see that as to-morn they will put\nme unto the death, then may ye rescue me as ye think best. I will well,\nsaid Sir Launcelot, for have ye no doubt, while I am living I shall\nrescue you. And then he kissed her, and either gave other a ring; and so\nthere he left the queen, and went until his lodging.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. How Sir Launcelot came to Sir Bors, and told him how he had\nsped, and in what adventure he had been, and how he had escaped.\n\n\nWHEN Sir Bors saw Sir Launcelot he was never so glad of his home-coming\nas he was then. Jesu mercy, said Sir Launcelot, why be ye all armed:\nwhat meaneth this? Sir, said Sir Bors, after ye were departed from us,\nwe all that be of your blood and your well-willers were so dretched that\nsome of us leapt out of our beds naked, and some in their dreams caught\nnaked swords in their hands; therefore, said Sir Bors, we deem there is\nsome great strife at hand; and then we all deemed that ye were betrapped\nwith some treason, and therefore we made us thus ready, what need that\never ye were in.\n\nMy fair nephew, said Sir Launcelot unto Sir Bors, now shall ye wit all,\nthat this night I was more harder bestead than ever I was in my life,\nand yet I escaped. And so he told them all how and in what manner, as\nye have heard to-fore. And therefore, my fellows, said Sir Launcelot, I\npray you all that ye will be of good heart in what need somever I stand,\nfor now is war come to us all. Sir, said Bors, all is welcome that God\nsendeth us, and we have had much weal with you and much worship, and\ntherefore we will take the woe with you as we have taken the weal. And\ntherefore, they said all (there were many good knights), look ye take no\ndiscomfort, for there nis no bands of knights under heaven but we shall\nbe able to grieve them as much as they may us. And therefore discomfort\nnot yourself by no manner, and we shall gather together that we love,\nand that loveth us, and what that ye will have done shall be done. And\ntherefore, Sir Launcelot, said they, we will take the woe with the weal.\nGrant mercy, said Sir Launcelot, of your good comfort, for in my great\ndistress, my fair nephew, ye comfort me greatly, and much I am beholding\nunto you. But this, my fair nephew, I would that ye did in all haste\nthat ye may, or it be forth days, that ye will look in their lodging\nthat be lodged here nigh about the king, which will hold with me, and\nwhich will not, for now I would know which were my friends from my foes.\nSir, said Sir Bors, I shall do my pain, and or it be seven of the clock\nI shall wit of such as ye have said before, who will hold with you.\n\nThen Sir Bors called unto him Sir Lionel, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir\nBlamore de Ganis, Sir Bleoberis de Ganis, Sir Gahalantine, Sir\nGalihodin, Sir Galihud, Sir Menadeuke Sir Villiers the Valiant, Sir\nHebes le Renoumes, Sir Lavaine Sir Urre of Hungary, Sir Nerounes, Sir\nPlenorius. These two knights Sir Launcelot made, and the one he won upon\na bridge, and therefore they would never be against him. And Harry le\nFise du Lake, and Sir Selises of the Dolorous Tower, and Sir Melias\nde Lile, and Sir Bellangere le Beuse, that was Sir Alisander's son Le\nOrphelin, because his mother Alice le Beale Pellerin and she was kin\nunto Sir Launcelot, and he held with him. So there came Sir Palomides\nand Sir Safere, his brother, to hold with Sir Launcelot, and Sir\nClegis of Sadok, and Sir Dinas, Sir Clarius of Cleremont. So these\ntwo-and-twenty knights drew them together, and by then they were armed\non horseback, and promised Sir Launcelot to do what he would. Then there\nfell to them, what of North Wales and of Cornwall, for Sir Lamorak's\nsake and for Sir Tristram's sake, to the number of a fourscore knights.\n\nMy lords, said Sir Launcelot, wit you well, I have been ever since I\ncame into this country well willed unto my lord, King Arthur, and unto\nmy lady, Queen Guenever, unto my power; and this night because my\nlady the queen sent for me to speak with her, I suppose it was made by\ntreason, howbeit I dare largely excuse her person, notwithstanding I was\nthere by a forecast near slain, but as Jesu provided me I escaped all\ntheir malice and treason. And then that noble knight Sir Launcelot told\nthem all how he was hard bestead in the queen's chamber, and how and in\nwhat manner he escaped from them. And therefore, said Sir Launcelot, wit\nyou well, my fair lords, I am sure there nis but war unto me and mine.\nAnd for because I have slain this night these knights, I wot well, as\nis Sir Agravaine Sir Gawaine's brother, and at the least twelve of his\nfellows, for this cause now I am sure of mortal war, for these knights\nwere sent and ordained by King Arthur to betray me. And therefore the\nking will in his heat and malice judge the queen to the fire, and that\nmay I not suffer, that she should be brent for my sake; for an I may be\nheard and suffered and so taken, I will fight for the queen, that she is\na true lady unto her lord; but the king in his heat I dread me will not\ntake me as I ought to be taken.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. Of the counsel and advice that was taken by Sir Launcelot\nand his friends for to save the queen.\n\n\nMY lord, Sir Launcelot, said Sir Bors, by mine advice ye shall take the\nwoe with the weal, and take it in patience, and thank God of it. And\nsithen it is fallen as it is, I counsel you keep yourself, for an ye\nwill yourself, there is no fellowship of knights christened that shall\ndo you wrong. Also I will counsel you my lord, Sir Launcelot, than an\nmy lady, Queen Guenever, be in distress, insomuch as she is in pain for\nyour sake, that ye knightly rescue her; an ye did otherwise, all the\nworld will speak of you shame to the world's end. Insomuch as ye were\ntaken with her, whether ye did right or wrong, it is now your part to\nhold with the queen, that she be not slain and put to a mischievous\ndeath, for an she so die the shame shall be yours. Jesu defend me from\nshame, said Sir Launcelot, and keep and save my lady the queen from\nvillainy and shameful death, and that she never be destroyed in my\ndefault; wherefore my fair lords, my kin, and my friends, said Sir\nLauncelot, what will ye do? Then they said all: We will do as ye will\ndo. I put this to you, said Sir Launcelot, that if my lord Arthur by\nevil counsel will to-morn in his heat put my lady the queen to the fire\nthere to be brent, now I pray you counsel me what is best to do. Then\nthey said all at once with one voice: Sir, us thinketh best that ye\nknightly rescue the queen, insomuch as she shall be brent it is for your\nsake; and it is to suppose, an ye might be handled, ye should have the\nsame death, or a more shamefuler death. And sir, we say all, that ye\nhave many times rescued her from death for other men's quarrels, us\nseemeth it is more your worship that ye rescue the queen from this\nperil, insomuch she hath it for your sake.\n\nThen Sir Launcelot stood still, and said: My fair lords, wit you well I\nwould be loath to do that thing that should dishonour you or my blood,\nand wit you well I would be loath that my lady, the queen, should die a\nshameful death; but an it be so that ye will counsel me to rescue her,\nI must do much harm or I rescue her; and peradventure I shall there\ndestroy some of my best friends, that should much repent me; and\nperadventure there be some, an they could well bring it about, or\ndisobey my lord King Arthur, they would soon come to me, the which I\nwere loath to hurt. And if so be that I rescue her, where shall I keep\nher? That shall be the least care of us all, said Sir Bors. How did the\nnoble knight Sir Tristram, by your good will? kept not he with him La\nBeale Isoud near three year in Joyous Gard? the which was done by your\nalther device, and that same place is your own; and in likewise may ye\ndo an ye list, and take the queen lightly away, if it so be the king\nwill judge her to be brent; and in Joyous Gard ye may keep her long\nenough until the heat of the king be past. And then shall ye bring again\nthe queen to the king with great worship; and then peradventure ye shall\nhave thank for her bringing home, and love and thank where other shall\nhave maugre.\n\nThat is hard to do, said Sir Launcelot, for by Sir Tristram I may have\na warning, for when by means of treaties, Sir Tristram brought again\nLa Beale Isoud unto King Mark from Joyous Gard, look what befell on\nthe end, how shamefully that false traitor King Mark slew him as he sat\nharping afore his lady La Beale Isoud, with a grounden glaive he thrust\nhim in behind to the heart. It grieveth me, said Sir Launcelot, to speak\nof his death, for all the world may not find such a knight. All this is\ntruth, said Sir Bors, but there is one thing shall courage you and\nus all, ye know well King Arthur and King Mark were never like of\nconditions, for there was never yet man could prove King Arthur untrue\nof his promise.\n\nSo to make short tale, they were all consented that for better outher\nfor worse, if so were that the queen were on that morn brought to the\nfire, shortly they all would rescue her. And so by the advice of\nSir Launcelot, they put them all in an embushment in a wood, as nigh\nCarlisle as they might, and there they abode still, to wit what the king\nwould do.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. How Sir Mordred rode hastily to the king, to tell him of\nthe affray and death of Sir Agravaine and the other knights.\n\n\nNOW turn we again unto Sir Mordred, that when he was escaped from the\nnoble knight, Sir Launcelot, he anon gat his horse and mounted upon him,\nand rode unto King Arthur, sore wounded and smitten, and all forbled;\nand there he told the king all how it was, and how they were all slain\nsave himself all only. Jesu mercy, how may this be? said the king; took\nye him in the queen's chamber? Yea, so God me help, said Sir Mordred,\nthere we found him unarmed, and there he slew Colgrevance, and armed him\nin his armour; and all this he told the king from the beginning to the\nending. Jesu mercy, said the king, he is a marvellous knight of prowess.\nAlas, me sore repenteth, said the king, that ever Sir Launcelot should\nbe against me. Now I am sure the noble fellowship of the Round Table is\nbroken for ever, for with him will many a noble knight hold; and now\nit is fallen so, said the king, that I may not with my worship, but the\nqueen must suffer the death. So then there was made great ordinance in\nthis heat, that the queen must be judged to the death. And the law was\nsuch in those days that whatsomever they were, of what estate or degree,\nif they were found guilty of treason, there should be none other remedy\nbut death; and outher the men or the taking with the deed should be\ncauser of their hasty judgment. And right so was it ordained for Queen\nGuenever, because Sir Mordred was escaped sore wounded, and the death of\nthirteen knights of the Round Table. These proofs and experiences caused\nKing Arthur to command the queen to the fire there to be brent.\n\nThen spake Sir Gawaine, and said: My lord Arthur, I would counsel you\nnot to be over-hasty, but that ye would put it in respite, this judgment\nof my lady the queen, for many causes. One it is, though it were so that\nSir Launcelot were found in the queen's chamber, yet it might be so that\nhe came thither for none evil; for ye know my lord, said Sir Gawaine,\nthat the queen is much beholden unto Sir Launcelot, more than unto any\nother knight, for ofttimes he hath saved her life, and done battle for\nher when all the court refused the queen; and peradventure she sent for\nhim for goodness and for none evil, to reward him for his good deeds\nthat he had done to her in times past. And peradventure my lady, the\nqueen, sent for him to that intent that Sir Launcelot should come to her\ngood grace privily and secretly, weening to her that it was best so to\ndo, in eschewing and dreading of slander; for ofttimes we do many things\nthat we ween it be for the best, and yet peradventure it turneth to the\nworst. For I dare say, said Sir Gawaine, my lady, your queen, is to you\nboth good and true; and as for Sir Launcelot, said Sir Gawaine, I dare\nsay he will make it good upon any knight living that will put upon\nhimself villainy or shame, and in like wise he will make good for my\nlady, Dame Guenever.\n\nThat I believe well, said King Arthur, but I will not that way with Sir\nLauncelot, for he trusteth so much upon his hands and his might that he\ndoubteth no man; and therefore for my queen he shall never fight more,\nfor she shall have the law. And if I may get Sir Launcelot, wit you well\nhe shall have a shameful death. Jesu defend, said Sir Gawaine, that I\nmay never see it. Why say ye so? said King Arthur; forsooth ye have\nno cause to love Sir Launcelot, for this night last past he slew your\nbrother, Sir Agravaine, a full good knight, and almost he had slain\nyour other brother, Sir Mordred, and also there he slew thirteen noble\nknights; and also, Sir Gawaine, remember you he slew two sons of yours,\nSir Florence and Sir Lovel. My lord, said Sir Gawaine, of all this I\nhave knowledge, of whose deaths I repent me sore; but insomuch I gave\nthem warning, and told my brethren and my sons aforehand what would fall\nin the end, insomuch they would not do by my counsel, I will not meddle\nme thereof, nor revenge me nothing of their deaths; for I told them\nit was no boot to strive with Sir Launcelot. Howbeit I am sorry of the\ndeath of my brethren and of my sons, for they are the causers of their\nown death; for ofttimes I warned my brother Sir Agravaine, and I told\nhim the perils the which be now fallen.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. How Sir Launcelot and his kinsmen rescued the queen from\nthe fire, and how he slew many knights.\n\n\nTHEN said the noble King Arthur to Sir Gawaine: Dear nephew, I pray you\nmake you ready in your best armour, with your brethren, Sir Gaheris and\nSir Gareth, to bring my queen to the fire, there to have her judgment\nand receive the death. Nay, my most noble lord, said Sir Gawaine, that\nwill I never do; for wit you well I will never be in that place where so\nnoble a queen as is my lady, Dame Guenever, shall take a shameful end.\nFor wit you well, said Sir Gawaine, my heart will never serve me to see\nher die; and it shall never be said that ever I was of your counsel of\nher death.\n\nThen said the king to Sir Gawaine: Suffer your brothers Sir Gaheris and\nSir Gareth to be there. My lord, said Sir Gawaine, wit you well they\nwill be loath to be there present, because of many adventures the which\nbe like there to fall, but they are young and full unable to say you\nnay. Then spake Sir Gaheris, and the good knight Sir Gareth, unto Sir\nArthur: Sir, ye may well command us to be there, but wit you well\nit shall be sore against our will; but an we be there by your strait\ncommandment ye shall plainly hold us there excused: we will be there\nin peaceable wise, and bear none harness of war upon us. In the name\nof God, said the king, then make you ready, for she shall soon have her\njudgment anon. Alas, said Sir Gawaine, that ever I should endure to see\nthis woful day. So Sir Gawaine turned him and wept heartily, and so\nhe went into his chamber; and then the queen was led forth without\nCarlisle, and there she was despoiled into her smock. And so then her\nghostly father was brought to her, to be shriven of her misdeeds. Then\nwas there weeping, and wailing, and wringing of hands, of many lords and\nladies, but there were but few in comparison that would bear any armour\nfor to strength the death of the queen.\n\nThen was there one that Sir Launcelot had sent unto that place for to\nespy what time the queen should go unto her death; and anon as he saw\nthe queen despoiled into her smock, and so shriven, then he gave Sir\nLauncelot warning. Then was there but spurring and plucking up of\nhorses, and right so they came to the fire. And who that stood against\nthem, there were they slain; there might none withstand Sir Launcelot,\nso all that bare arms and withstood them, there were they slain, full\nmany a noble knight. For there was slain Sir Belliance le Orgulous,\nSir Segwarides, Sir Griflet, Sir Brandiles, Sir Aglovale, Sir Tor;\nSir Gauter, Sir Gillimer, Sir Reynolds' three brethren; Sir Damas, Sir\nPriamus, Sir Kay the Stranger, Sir Driant, Sir Lambegus, Sir Herminde;\nSir Pertilope, Sir Perimones, two brethren that were called the Green\nKnight and the Red Knight. And so in this rushing and hurling, as Sir\nLauncelot thrang here and there, it mishapped him to slay Gaheris and\nSir Gareth, the noble knight, for they were unarmed and unware. For as\nthe French book saith, Sir Launcelot smote Sir Gareth and Sir Gaheris\nupon the brain-pans, wherethrough they were slain in the field; howbeit\nin very truth Sir Launcelot saw them not, and so were they found dead\namong the thickest of the press.\n\nThen when Sir Launcelot had thus done, and slain and put to flight all\nthat would withstand him, then he rode straight unto Dame Guenever, and\nmade a kirtle and a gown to be cast upon her; and then he made her to\nbe set behind him, and prayed her to be of good cheer. Wit you well the\nqueen was glad that she was escaped from the death. And then she thanked\nGod and Sir Launcelot; and so he rode his way with the queen, as the\nFrench book saith, unto Joyous Gard, and there he kept her as a noble\nknight should do; and many great lords and some kings sent Sir Launcelot\nmany good knights, and many noble knights drew unto Sir Launcelot.\nWhen this was known openly, that King Arthur and Sir Launcelot were at\ndebate, many knights were glad of their debate, and many were full heavy\nof their debate.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. Of the sorrow and lamentation of King Arthur for the death\nof his nephews and other good knights, and also for the queen, his wife.\n\n\nSO turn we again unto King Arthur, that when it was told him how and in\nwhat manner of wise the queen was taken away from the fire, and when he\nheard of the death of his noble knights, and in especial of Sir Gaheris\nand Sir Gareth's death, then the king swooned for pure sorrow. And when\nhe awoke of his swoon, then he said: Alas, that ever I bare crown upon\nmy head! for now have I lost the fairest fellowship of noble knights\nthat ever held Christian king together. Alas, my good knights be slain\naway from me: now within these two days I have lost forty knights, and\nalso the noble fellowship of Sir Launcelot and his blood, for now I may\nnever hold them together no more with my worship. Alas that ever this\nwar began. Now fair fellows, said the king, I charge you that no man\ntell Sir Gawaine of the death of his two brethren; for I am sure, said\nthe king, when Sir Gawaine heareth tell that Sir Gareth is dead he will\ngo nigh out of his mind. Mercy Jesu, said the king, why slew he Sir\nGareth and Sir Gaheris, for I dare say as for Sir Gareth he loved Sir\nLauncelot above all men earthly. That is truth, said some knights, but\nthey were slain in the hurtling as Sir Launcelot thrang in the thick of\nthe press; and as they were unarmed he smote them and wist not whom\nthat he smote, and so unhappily they were slain. The death of them, said\nArthur, will cause the greatest mortal war that ever was; I am sure,\nwist Sir Gawaine that Sir Gareth were slain, I should never have rest\nof him till I had destroyed Sir Launcelot's kin and himself both, outher\nelse he to destroy me. And therefore, said the king, wit you well my\nheart was never so heavy as it is now, and much more I am sorrier for\nmy good knights' loss than for the loss of my fair queen; for queens I\nmight have enow, but such a fellowship of good knights shall never be\ntogether in no company. And now I dare say, said King Arthur, there was\nnever Christian king held such a fellowship together; and alas that ever\nSir Launcelot and I should be at debate. Ah Agravaine, Agravaine, said\nthe king, Jesu forgive it thy soul, for thine evil will, that thou and\nthy brother Sir Mordred hadst unto Sir Launcelot, hath caused all this\nsorrow: and ever among these complaints the king wept and swooned.\n\nThen there came one unto Sir Gawaine, and told him how the queen was led\naway with Sir Launcelot, and nigh a twenty-four knights slain. O Jesu\ndefend my brethren, said Sir Gawaine, for full well wist I that Sir\nLauncelot would rescue her, outher else he would die in that field; and\nto say the truth he had not been a man of worship had he not rescued the\nqueen that day, insomuch she should have been brent for his sake. And\nas in that, said Sir Gawaine, he hath done but knightly, and as I would\nhave done myself an I had stood in like case. But where are my brethren?\nsaid Sir Gawaine, I marvel I hear not of them. Truly, said that man, Sir\nGareth and Sir Gaheris be slain. Jesu defend, said Sir Gawaine, for\nall the world I would not that they were slain, and in especial my good\nbrother, Sir Gareth. Sir, said the man, he is slain, and that is great\npity. Who slew him? said Sir Gawaine. Sir, said the man, Launcelot slew\nthem both. That may I not believe, said Sir Gawaine, that ever he slew\nmy brother, Sir Gareth; for I dare say my brother Gareth loved him\nbetter than me, and all his brethren, and the king both. Also I dare\nsay, an Sir Launcelot had desired my brother Sir Gareth, with him he\nwould have been with him against the king and us all, and therefore I\nmay never believe that Sir Launcelot slew my brother. Sir, said this\nman, it is noised that he slew him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. How King Arthur at the request of Sir Gawaine concluded to\nmake war against Sir Launcelot, and laid siege to his castle called\nJoyous Gard.\n\n\nALAS, said Sir Gawaine, now is my joy gone. And then he fell down and\nswooned, and long he lay there as he had been dead. And then, when he\narose of his swoon, he cried out sorrowfully, and said: Alas! And right\nso Sir Gawaine ran to the king, crying and weeping: O King Arthur, mine\nuncle, my good brother Sir Gareth is slain, and so is my brother Sir\nGaheris, the which were two noble knights. Then the king wept, and he\nboth; and so they fell a-swooning. And when they were revived then spake\nSir Gawaine: Sir, I will go see my brother, Sir Gareth. Ye may not see\nhim, said the king, for I caused him to be interred, and Sir Gaheris\nboth; for I well understood that ye would make over-much sorrow, and\nthe sight of Sir Gareth should have caused your double sorrow. Alas,\nmy lord, said Sir Gawaine, how slew he my brother, Sir Gareth? Mine own\ngood lord I pray you tell me. Truly, said the king, I shall tell you how\nit is told me, Sir Launcelot slew him and Sir Gaheris both. Alas, said\nSir Gawaine, they bare none arms against him, neither of them both. I\nwot not how it was, said the king, but as it is said, Sir Launcelot slew\nthem both in the thickest of the press and knew them not; and therefore\nlet us shape a remedy for to revenge their deaths.\n\nMy king, my lord, and mine uncle, said Sir Gawaine, wit you well now I\nshall make you a promise that I shall hold by my knighthood, that from\nthis day I shall never fail Sir Launcelot until the one of us have slain\nthe other. And therefore I require you, my lord and king, dress you to\nthe war, for wit you well I will be revenged upon Sir Launcelot;\nand therefore, as ye will have my service and my love, now haste you\nthereto, and assay your friends. For I promise unto God, said Sir\nGawaine, for the death of my brother, Sir Gareth, I shall seek Sir\nLauncelot throughout seven kings' realms, but I shall slay him or else\nhe shall slay me. Ye shall not need to seek him so far, said the king,\nfor as I hear say, Sir Launcelot will abide me and you in the Joyous\nGard; and much people draweth unto him, as I hear say. That may I\nbelieve, said Sir Gawaine; but my lord, he said, assay your friends, and\nI will assay mine. It shall be done, said the king, and as I suppose I\nshall be big enough to draw him out of the biggest tower of his castle.\n\nSo then the king sent letters and writs throughout all England, both in\nthe length and the breadth, for to assummon all his knights. And so unto\nArthur drew many knights, dukes, and earls, so that he had a great host.\nAnd when they were assembled, the king informed them how Sir Launcelot\nhad bereft him his queen. Then the king and all his host made them\nready to lay siege about Sir Launcelot, where he lay within Joyous Gard.\nThereof heard Sir Launcelot, and purveyed him of many good knights, for\nwith him held many knights; and some for his own sake, and some for\nthe queen's sake. Thus they were on both parties well furnished and\ngarnished of all manner of thing that longed to the war. But King\nArthur's host was so big that Sir Launcelot would not abide him in the\nfield, for he was full loath to do battle against the king; but Sir\nLauncelot drew him to his strong castle with all manner of victual, and\nas many noble men as he might suffice within the town and the castle.\nThen came King Arthur with Sir Gawaine with an huge host, and laid a\nsiege all about Joyous Gard, both at the town and at the castle, and\nthere they made strong war on both parties. But in no wise Sir Launcelot\nwould ride out, nor go out of his castle, of long time; neither he would\nnone of his good knights to issue out, neither none of the town nor of\nthe castle, until fifteen weeks were past.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. Of the communication between King Arthur and Sir Launcelot,\nand how King Arthur reproved him.\n\nTHEN it befell upon a day in harvest time, Sir Launcelot looked over\nthe walls, and spake on high unto King Arthur and Sir Gawaine: My lords\nboth, wit ye well all is in vain that ye make at this siege, for here\nwin ye no worship but maugre and dishonour; for an it list me to come\nmyself out and my good knights, I should full soon make an end of\nthis war. Come forth, said Arthur unto Launcelot, an thou durst, and\nI promise thee I shall meet thee in midst of the field. God defend me,\nsaid Sir Launcelot, that ever I should encounter with the most noble\nking that made me knight. Fie upon thy fair language, said the king,\nfor wit you well and trust it, I am thy mortal foe, and ever will to my\ndeath day; for thou hast slain my good knights, and full noble men of\nmy blood, that I shall never recover again. Also thou hast lain by my\nqueen, and holden her many winters, and sithen like a traitor taken her\nfrom me by force.\n\nMy most noble lord and king, said Sir Launcelot, ye may say what ye\nwill, for ye wot well with yourself will I not strive; but thereas ye\nsay I have slain your good knights, I wot well that I have done so, and\nthat me sore repenteth; but I was enforced to do battle with them in\nsaving of my life, or else I must have suffered them to have slain me.\nAnd as for my lady, Queen Guenever, except your person of your highness,\nand my lord Sir Gawaine, there is no knight under heaven that dare make\nit good upon me, that ever I was a traitor unto your person. And where\nit please you to say that I have holden my lady your queen years and\nwinters, unto that I shall ever make a large answer, and prove it upon\nany knight that beareth the life, except your person and Sir Gawaine,\nthat my lady, Queen Guenever, is a true lady unto your person as any is\nliving unto her lord, and that will I make good with my hands. Howbeit\nit hath liked her good grace to have me in chierte, and to cherish me\nmore than any other knight; and unto my power I again have deserved her\nlove, for ofttimes, my lord, ye have consented that she should be brent\nand destroyed, in your heat, and then it fortuned me to do battle for\nher, and or I departed from her adversary they confessed their untruth,\nand she full worshipfully excused. And at such times, my lord Arthur,\nsaid Sir Launcelot, ye loved me, and thanked me when I saved your queen\nfrom the fire; and then ye promised me for ever to be my good lord; and\nnow methinketh ye reward me full ill for my good service. And my good\nlord, meseemeth I had lost a great part of my worship in my knighthood\nan I had suffered my lady, your queen, to have been brent, and insomuch\nshe should have been brent for my sake. For sithen I have done battles\nfor your queen in other quarrels than in mine own, meseemeth now I had\nmore right to do battle for her in right quarrel. And therefore my good\nand gracious lord, said Sir Launcelot, take your queen unto your good\ngrace, for she is both fair, true, and good.\n\nFie on thee, false recreant knight, said Sir Gawaine; I let thee wit my\nlord, mine uncle, King Arthur, shall have his queen and thee, maugre thy\nvisage, and slay you both whether it please him. It may well be, said\nSir Launcelot, but wit you well, my lord Sir Gawaine, an me list to come\nout of this castle ye should win me and the queen more harder than ever\nye won a strong battle. Fie on thy proud words, said Sir Gawaine; as for\nmy lady, the queen, I will never say of her shame. But thou, false and\nrecreant knight, said Sir Gawaine, what cause hadst thou to slay my\ngood brother Sir Gareth, that loved thee more than all my kin? Alas thou\nmadest him knight thine own hands; why slew thou him that loved thee so\nwell? For to excuse me, said Sir Launcelot, it helpeth me not, but by\nJesu, and by the faith that I owe to the high order of knighthood, I\nshould with as good will have slain my nephew, Sir Bors de Ganis, at\nthat time. But alas that ever I was so unhappy, said Launcelot, that I\nhad not seen Sir Gareth and Sir Gaheris.\n\nThou liest, recreant knight, said Sir Gawaine, thou slewest him in\ndespite of me; and therefore, wit thou well I shall make war to\nthee, and all the while that I may live. That me repenteth, said Sir\nLauncelot; for well I understand it helpeth not to seek none accordment\nwhile ye, Sir Gawaine, are so mischievously set. And if ye were not, I\nwould not doubt to have the good grace of my lord Arthur. I believe it\nwell, false recreant knight, said Sir Gawaine; for thou hast many long\ndays overled me and us all, and destroyed many of our good knights. Ye\nsay as it pleaseth you, said Sir Launcelot; and yet may it never be said\non me, and openly proved, that ever I by forecast of treason slew no\ngood knight, as my lord, Sir Gawaine, ye have done; and so did I never,\nbut in my defence that I was driven thereto, in saving of my life. Ah,\nfalse knight, said Sir Gawaine, that thou meanest by Sir Lamorak: wit\nthou well I slew him. Ye slew him not yourself, said Sir Launcelot; it\nhad been overmuch on hand for you to have slain him, for he was one of\nthe best knights christened of his age, and it was great pity of his\ndeath.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. How the cousins and kinsmen of Sir Launcelot excited him to\ngo out to battle, and how they made them ready.\n\n\nWELL, well, said Sir Gawaine to Launcelot, sithen thou enbraidest me of\nSir Lamorak, wit thou well I shall never leave thee till I have thee at\nsuch avail that thou shalt not escape my hands. I trust you well enough,\nsaid Sir Launcelot, an ye may get me I get but little mercy. But as\nthe French book saith, the noble King Arthur would have taken his queen\nagain, and have been accorded with Sir Launcelot, but Sir Gawaine would\nnot suffer him by no manner of mean. And then Sir Gawaine made many\nmen to blow upon Sir Launcelot; and all at once they called him false\nrecreant knight.\n\nThen when Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir Ector de Maris, and Sir Lionel, heard\nthis outcry, they called to them Sir Palomides, Sir Safere's brother,\nand Sir Lavaine, with many more of their blood, and all they went unto\nSir Launcelot, and said thus: My lord Sir Launcelot, wit ye well we\nhave great scorn of the great rebukes that we heard Gawaine say to you;\nwherefore we pray you, and charge you as ye will have our service, keep\nus no longer within these walls; for wit you well plainly, we will ride\ninto the field and do battle with them; for ye fare as a man that were\nafeard, and for all your fair speech it will not avail you. For wit you\nwell Sir Gawaine will not suffer you to be accorded with King Arthur,\nand therefore fight for your life and your right, an ye dare. Alas, said\nSir Launcelot, for to ride out of this castle, and to do battle, I am\nfull loath.\n\nThen Sir Launcelot spake on high unto Sir Arthur and Sir Gawaine: My\nlords, I require you and beseech you, sithen that I am thus required and\nconjured to ride into the field, that neither you, my lord King Arthur,\nnor you Sir Gawaine, come not into the field. What shall we do then?\nsaid Sir Gawaine, [N]is this the king's quarrel with thee to fight? and\nit is my quarrel to fight with thee, Sir Launcelot, because of the\ndeath of my brother Sir Gareth. Then must I needs unto battle, said Sir\nLauncelot. Now wit you well, my lord Arthur and Sir Gawaine, ye will\nrepent it whensomever I do battle with you.\n\nAnd so then they departed either from other; and then either party made\nthem ready on the morn for to do battle, and great purveyance was made\non both sides; and Sir Gawaine let purvey many knights for to wait upon\nSir Launcelot, for to overset him and to slay him. And on the morn at\nunderne Sir Arthur was ready in the field with three great hosts. And\nthen Sir Launcelot's fellowship came out at three gates, in a full good\narray; and Sir Lionel came in the foremost battle, and Sir Launcelot\ncame in the middle, and Sir Bors came out at the third gate. Thus they\ncame in order and rule, as full noble knights; and always Sir Launcelot\ncharged all his knights in any wise to save King Arthur and Sir Gawaine.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. How Sir Gawaine jousted and smote down Sir Lionel, and how\nSir Launcelot horsed King Arthur.\n\n\nTHEN came forth Sir Gawaine from the king's host, and he came before and\nproffered to joust. And Sir Lionel was a fierce knight, and lightly he\nencountered with Sir Gawaine; and there Sir Gawaine smote Sir Lionel\nthrough out the body, that he dashed to the earth like as he had been\ndead; and then Sir Ector de Maris and other more bare him into the\ncastle. Then there began a great stour, and much people was slain; and\never Sir Launcelot did what he might to save the people on King Arthur's\nparty, for Sir Palomides, and Sir Bors, and Sir Safere, overthrew many\nknights, for they were deadly knights. And Sir Blamore de Ganis, and Sir\nBleoberis de Ganis, with Sir Bellangere le Beuse, these six knights did\nmuch harm; and ever King Arthur was nigh about Sir Launcelot to have\nslain him, and Sir Launcelot suffered him, and would not strike again.\nSo Sir Bors encountered with King Arthur, and there with a spear Sir\nBors smote him down; and so he alighted and drew his sword, and said\nto Sir Launcelot: Shall I make an end of this war? and that he meant to\nhave slain King Arthur. Not so hardy, said Sir Launcelot, upon pain of\nthy head, that thou touch him no more, for I will never see that most\nnoble king that made me knight neither slain ne shamed. And therewithal\nSir Launcelot alighted off his horse and took up the king and horsed him\nagain, and said thus: My lord Arthur, for God's love stint this strife,\nfor ye get here no worship, and I would do mine utterance, but always I\nforbear you, and ye nor none of yours forbeareth me; my lord, remember\nwhat I have done in many places, and now I am evil rewarded.\n\nThen when King Arthur was on horseback, he looked upon Sir Launcelot,\nand then the tears brast out of his eyen, thinking on the great courtesy\nthat was in Sir Launcelot more than in any other man; and therewith the\nking rode his way, and might no longer behold him, and said: Alas, that\never this war began. And then either parties of the battles withdrew\nthem to repose them, and buried the dead, and to the wounded men they\nlaid soft salves; and thus they endured that night till on the morn. And\non the morn by underne they made them ready to do battle. And then Sir\nBors led the forward.\n\nSo upon the morn there came Sir Gawaine as brim as any boar, with a\ngreat spear in his hand. And when Sir Bors saw him he thought to revenge\nhis brother Sir Lionel of the despite that Sir Gawaine did him the other\nday. And so they that knew either other feutred their spears, and with\nall their mights of their horses and themselves, they met together so\nfelonously that either bare other through, and so they fell both to the\nearth; and then the battles joined, and there was much slaughter on\nboth parties. Then Sir Launcelot rescued Sir Bors, and sent him into the\ncastle; but neither Sir Gawaine nor Sir Bors died not of their wounds,\nfor they were all holpen. Then Sir Lavaine and Sir Urre prayed Sir\nLauncelot to do his pain, and fight as they had done; For we see ye\nforbear and spare, and that doth much harm; therefore we pray you spare\nnot your enemies no more than they do you. Alas, said Sir Launcelot, I\nhave no heart to fight against my lord Arthur, for ever meseemeth I do\nnot as I ought to do. My lord, said Sir Palomides, though ye spare them\nall this day they will never con you thank; and if they may get you at\navail ye are but dead. So then Sir Launcelot understood that they said\nhim truth; and then he strained himself more than he did aforehand, and\nbecause his nephew Sir Bors was sore wounded. And then within a little\nwhile, by evensong time, Sir Launcelot and his party better stood, for\ntheir horses went in blood past the fetlocks, there was so much people\nslain. And then for pity Sir Launcelot withheld his knights, and\nsuffered King Arthur's party for to withdraw them aside. And then Sir\nLauncelot's party withdrew them into his castle, and either parties\nburied the dead, and put salve unto the wounded men.\n\nSo when Sir Gawaine was hurt, they on King Arthur's party were not so\norgulous as they were toforehand to do battle. Of this war was noised\nthrough all Christendom, and at the last it was noised afore the\nPope; and he considering the great goodness of King Arthur, and of\nSir Launcelot, that was called the most noblest knights of the world,\nwherefore the Pope called unto him a noble clerk that at that time was\nthere present; the French book saith, it was the Bishop of Rochester;\nand the Pope gave him bulls under lead unto King Arthur of England,\ncharging him upon pain of interdicting of all England, that he take his\nqueen Dame Guenever unto him again, and accord with Sir Launcelot.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. How the Pope sent down his bulls to make peace, and how Sir\nLauncelot brought the queen to King Arthur.\n\n\nSO when this Bishop was come to Carlisle he shewed the king these bulls.\nAnd when the king understood these bulls he nist what to do: full fain\nhe would have been accorded with Sir Launcelot, but Sir Gawaine would\nnot suffer him; but as for to have the queen, thereto he agreed. But\nin nowise Sir Gawaine would not suffer the king to accord with Sir\nLauncelot; but as for the queen he consented. And then the Bishop had\nof the king his great seal, and his assurance as he was a true anointed\nking that Sir Launcelot should come safe, and go safe, and that the\nqueen should not be spoken unto of the king, nor of none other, for no\nthing done afore time past; and of all these appointments the Bishop\nbrought with him sure assurance and writing, to shew Sir Launcelot.\n\nSo when the Bishop was come to Joyous Gard, there he shewed Sir\nLauncelot how the Pope had written to Arthur and unto him, and there he\ntold him the perils if he withheld the queen from the king. It was\nnever in my thought, said Launcelot, to withhold the queen from my lord\nArthur; but, insomuch she should have been dead for my sake, meseemeth\nit was my part to save her life, and put her from that danger, till\nbetter recover might come. And now I thank God, said Sir Launcelot, that\nthe Pope hath made her peace; for God knoweth, said Sir Launcelot, I\nwill be a thousandfold more gladder to bring her again, than ever I was\nof her taking away; with this, I may be sure to come safe and go safe,\nand that the queen shall have her liberty as she had before; and never\nfor no thing that hath been surmised afore this time, she never from\nthis day stand in no peril. For else, said Sir Launcelot, I dare\nadventure me to keep her from an harder shour than ever I kept her. It\nshall not need you, said the Bishop, to dread so much; for wit you well,\nthe Pope must be obeyed, and it were not the Pope's worship nor my poor\nhonesty to wit you distressed, neither the queen, neither in peril, nor\nshamed. And then he shewed Sir Launcelot all his writing, both from the\nPope and from King Arthur. This is sure enough, said Sir Launcelot, for\nfull well I dare trust my lord's own writing and his seal, for he was\nnever shamed of his promise. Therefore, said Sir Launcelot unto the\nBishop, ye shall ride unto the king afore, and recommend me unto his\ngood grace, and let him have knowledging that this same day eight days,\nby the grace of God, I myself shall bring my lady, Queen Guenever,\nunto him. And then say ye unto my most redoubted king, that I will say\nlargely for the queen, that I shall none except for dread nor fear,\nbut the king himself, and my lord Sir Gawaine; and that is more for the\nking's love than for himself.\n\nSo the Bishop departed and came to the king at Carlisle, and told him\nall how Sir Launcelot answered him; and then the tears brast out of the\nking's eyen. Then Sir Launcelot purveyed him an hundred knights, and all\nwere clothed in green velvet, and their horses trapped to their heels;\nand every knight held a branch of olive in his hand, in tokening of\npeace. And the queen had four-and-twenty gentlewomen following her in\nthe same wise; and Sir Launcelot had twelve coursers following him, and\non every courser sat a young gentleman, and all they were arrayed in\ngreen velvet, with sarps of gold about their quarters, and the horse\ntrapped in the same wise down to the heels, with many ouches, y-set with\nstones and pearls in gold, to the number of a thousand. And she and Sir\nLauncelot were clothed in white cloth of gold tissue; and right so as\nye have heard, as the French book maketh mention, he rode with the\nqueen from Joyous Gard to Carlisle. And so Sir Launcelot rode throughout\nCarlisle, and so in the castle, that all men might behold; and wit\nyou well there was many a weeping eye. And then Sir Launcelot himself\nalighted and avoided his horse, and took the queen, and so led her where\nKing Arthur was in his seat: and Sir Gawaine sat afore him, and many\nother great lords. So when Sir Launcelot saw the king and Sir Gawaine,\nthen he led the queen by the arm, and then he kneeled down, and the\nqueen both. Wit you well then was there many bold knight there with King\nArthur that wept as tenderly as though they had seen all their kin afore\nthem. So the king sat still, and said no word. And when Sir Launcelot\nsaw his countenance, he arose and pulled up the queen with him, and thus\nhe spake full knightly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. Of the deliverance of the queen to the king by Sir\nLauncelot, and what language Sir Gawaine had to Sir Launcelot.\n\n\nMY most redoubted king, ye shall understand, by the Pope's commandment\nand yours, I have brought to you my lady the queen, as right requireth;\nand if there be any knight, of whatsomever degree that he be, except\nyour person, that will say or dare say but that she is true and clean\nto you, I here myself, Sir Launcelot du Lake, will make it good upon his\nbody, that she is a true lady unto you; but liars ye have listened, and\nthat hath caused debate betwixt you and me. For time hath been, my lord\nArthur, that ye have been greatly pleased with me when I did battle for\nmy lady, your queen; and full well ye know, my most noble king, that she\nhath been put to great wrong or this time; and sithen it pleased you at\nmany times that I should fight for her, meseemeth, my good lord, I had\nmore cause to rescue her from the fire, insomuch she should have been\nbrent for my sake. For they that told you those tales were liars, and so\nit fell upon them; for by likelihood had not the might of God been with\nme, I might never have endured fourteen knights, and they armed and\nafore purposed, and I unarmed and not purposed. For I was sent for unto\nmy lady your queen, I wot not for what cause; but I was not so soon\nwithin the chamber door, but anon Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred called\nme traitor and recreant knight. They called thee right, said Sir\nGawaine. My lord Sir Gawaine, said Sir Launcelot, in their quarrel they\nproved themselves not in the right. Well well, Sir Launcelot, said the\nking, I have given thee no cause to do to me as thou hast done, for I\nhave worshipped thee and thine more than any of all my knights.\n\nMy good lord, said Sir Launcelot, so ye be not displeased, ye shall\nunderstand I and mine have done you oft better service than any other\nknights have done, in many divers places; and where ye have been full\nhard bestead divers times, I have myself rescued you from many dangers;\nand ever unto my power I was glad to please you, and my lord Sir\nGawaine; both in jousts, and tournaments, and in battles set, both\non horseback and on foot, I have often rescued you, and my lord Sir\nGawaine, and many mo of your knights in many divers places. For now I\nwill make avaunt, said Sir Launcelot, I will that ye all wit that yet\nI found never no manner of knight but that I was overhard for him, an I\nhad done my utterance, thanked be God; howbeit I have been matched with\ngood knights, as Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak, but ever I had a favour\nunto them and a deeming what they were. And I take God to record, said\nSir Launcelot, I never was wroth nor greatly heavy with no good knight\nan I saw him busy about to win worship; and glad I was ever when I found\nany knight that might endure me on horseback and on foot: howbeit Sir\nCarados of the Dolorous Tower was a full noble knight and a passing\nstrong man, and that wot ye, my lord Sir Gawaine; for he might well\nbe called a noble knight when he by fine force pulled you out of your\nsaddle, and bound you overthwart afore him to his saddle bow; and there,\nmy lord Sir Gawaine, I rescued you, and slew him afore your sight. Also\nI found his brother, Sir Turquin, in likewise leading Sir Gaheris, your\nbrother, bounden afore him; and there I rescued your brother and slew\nthat Turquin, and delivered three-score-and-four of my lord Arthur's\nknights out of his prison. And now I dare say, said Sir Launcelot, I met\nnever with so strong knights, nor so well fighting, as was Sir Carados\nand Sir Turquin, for I fought with them to the uttermost. And therefore,\nsaid Sir Launcelot unto Sir Gawaine, meseemeth ye ought of right to\nremember this; for, an I might have your good will, I would trust to God\nto have my lord Arthur's good grace.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. Of the communication between Sir Gawaine and Sir Launcelot,\nwith much other language.\n\n\nTHE king may do as he will, said Sir Gawaine, but wit thou well, Sir\nLauncelot, thou and I shall never be accorded while we live, for thou\nhast slain three of my brethren; and two of them ye slew traitorly and\npiteously, for they bare none harness against thee, nor none would bear.\nGod would they had been armed, said Sir Launcelot, for then had they\nbeen alive. And wit ye well Sir Gawaine, as for Sir Gareth, I love none\nof my kinsmen so much as I did him; and ever while I live, said Sir\nLauncelot, I will bewail Sir Gareth's death, not all only for the great\nfear I have of you, but many causes cause me to be sorrowful. One is,\nfor I made him knight; another is, I wot well he loved me above all\nother knights; and the third is, he was passing noble, true, courteous,\nand gentle, and well conditioned; the fourth is, I wist well, anon as I\nheard that Sir Gareth was dead, I should never after have your love, but\neverlasting war betwixt us; and also I wist well that ye would cause my\nnoble lord Arthur for ever to be my mortal foe. And as Jesu be my help,\nsaid Sir Launcelot, I slew never Sir Gareth nor Sir Gaheris by my will;\nbut alas that ever they were unarmed that unhappy day. But thus much\nI shall offer me, said Sir Launcelot, if it may please the king's good\ngrace, and you, my lord Sir Gawaine, I shall first begin at Sandwich,\nand there I shall go in my shirt, barefoot; and at every ten miles' end\nI will found and gar make an house of religion, of what order that ye\nwill assign me, with an whole convent, to sing and read, day and night,\nin especial for Sir Gareth's sake and Sir Gaheris. And this shall\nI perform from Sandwich unto Carlisle; and every house shall have\nsufficient livelihood. And this shall I perform while I have any\nlivelihood in Christendom; and there nis none of all these religious\nplaces, but they shall be performed, furnished and garnished in all\nthings as an holy place ought to be, I promise you faithfully. And this,\nSir Gawaine, methinketh were more fairer, holier, and more better to\ntheir souls, than ye, my most noble king, and you, Sir Gawaine, to war\nupon me, for thereby shall ye get none avail.\n\nThen all knights and ladies that were there wept as they were mad, and\nthe tears fell on King Arthur's cheeks. Sir Launcelot, said Sir Gawaine,\nI have right well heard thy speech, and thy great proffers, but wit\nthou well, let the king do as it pleased him, I will never forgive my\nbrothers' death, and in especial the death of my brother, Sir Gareth.\nAnd if mine uncle, King Arthur, will accord with thee, he shall lose my\nservice, for wit thou well thou art both false to the king and to me.\nSir, said Launcelot he beareth not the life that may make that good and\nif ye, Sir Gawaine, will charge me with so high a thing, ye must pardon\nme, for then needs must I answer you. Nay, said Sir Gawaine, we are past\nthat at this time, and that caused the Pope, for he hath charged mine\nuncle, the king, that he shall take his queen again, and to accord with\nthee, Sir Launcelot, as for this season, and therefore thou shalt go\nsafe as thou camest. But in this land thou shalt not abide past fifteen\ndays, such summons I give thee: so the king and we were consented and\naccorded or thou camest. And else, said Sir Gawaine, wit thou well thou\nshouldst not have come here, but if it were maugre thy head. And if\nit were not for the Pope's commandment, said Sir Gawaine, I should do\nbattle with mine own body against thy body, and prove it upon thee, that\nthou hast been both false unto mine uncle King Arthur, and to me both;\nand that shall I prove upon thy body, when thou art departed from hence,\nwheresomever I find thee.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. How Sir Launcelot departed from the king and from Joyous\nGard over seaward, and what knights went with him.\n\n\nTHEN Sir Launcelot sighed, and therewith the tears fell on his cheeks,\nand then he said thus: Alas, most noble Christian realm, whom I have\nloved above all other realms, and in thee I have gotten a great part of\nmy worship, and now I shall depart in this wise. Truly me repenteth\nthat ever I came in this realm, that should be thus shamefully banished,\nundeserved and causeless; but fortune is so variant, and the wheel so\nmoveable, there nis none constant abiding, and that may be proved by\nmany old chronicles, of noble Ector, and Troilus, and Alisander, the\nmighty conqueror, and many mo other; when they were most in their\nroyalty, they alighted lowest. And so fareth it by me, said Sir\nLauncelot, for in this realm I had worship, and by me and mine all the\nwhole Round Table hath been increased more in worship, by me and mine\nblood, than by any other. And therefore wit thou well, Sir Gawaine, I\nmay live upon my lands as well as any knight that here is. And if ye,\nmost redoubted king, will come upon my lands with Sir Gawaine to war\nupon me, I must endure you as well as I may. But as to you, Sir Gawaine,\nif that ye come there, I pray you charge me not with treason nor felony,\nfor an ye do, I must answer you. Do thou thy best, said Sir Gawaine;\ntherefore hie thee fast that thou were gone, and wit thou well we shall\nsoon come after, and break the strongest castle that thou hast, upon thy\nhead. That shall not need, said Sir Launcelot, for an I were as orgulous\nset as ye are, wit you well I should meet you in midst of the field.\nMake thou no more language, said Sir Gawaine, but deliver the queen from\nthee, and pike thee lightly out of this court. Well, said Sir Launcelot,\nan I had wist of this short coming, I would have advised me twice or\nthat I had come hither; for an the queen had been so dear to me as ye\nnoise her, I durst have kept her from the fellowship of the best knights\nunder heaven.\n\nAnd then Sir Launcelot said unto Guenever, in hearing of the king and\nthem all: Madam, now I must depart from you and this noble fellowship\nfor ever; and sithen it is so, I beseech you to pray for me, and say me\nwell; and if ye be hard bestead by any false tongues, lightly my lady\nsend me word, and if any knight's hands may deliver you by battle, I\nshall deliver you. And therewithal Sir Launcelot kissed the queen; and\nthen he said all openly. Now let see what he be in this place that dare\nsay the queen is not true unto my lord Arthur, let see who will speak an\nhe dare speak. And therewith he brought the queen to the king, and then\nSir Launcelot took his leave and departed; and there was neither king,\nduke, nor earl, baron nor knight, lady nor gentlewoman, but all they\nwept as people out of their mind, except Sir Gawaine. And when the noble\nSir Launcelot took his horse to ride out of Carlisle, there was sobbing\nand weeping for pure dole of his departing; and so he took his way unto\nJoyous Gard. And then ever after he called it the Dolorous Gard. And\nthus departed Sir Launcelot from the court for ever.\n\nAnd so when he came to Joyous Gard he called his fellowship unto him,\nand asked them what they would do Then they answered all wholly together\nwith one voice they would as he would do. My fair fellows, said Sir\nLauncelot, I must depart out of this most noble realm, and now I shall\ndepart it grieveth me sore, for I shall depart with no worship, for a\nflemed man departed never out of a realm with no worship; and that is my\nheaviness, for ever I fear after my days that men shall chronicle upon\nme that I was flemed out of this land; and else, my fair lords, be ye\nsure, an I had not dread shame, my lady, Queen Guenever, and I should\nnever have departed.\n\nThen spake many noble knights, as Sir Palomides, Sir Safere his brother,\nand Sir Bellingere le Beuse, and Sir Urre, with Sir Lavaine, with many\nothers: Sir, an ye be so disposed to abide in this land we will never\nfail you; and if ye list not to abide in this land there nis none of the\ngood knights that here be will fail you, for many causes. One is, all\nwe that be not of your blood shall never be welcome to the court.\nAnd sithen it liked us to take a part with you in your distress and\nheaviness in this realm, wit you well it shall like us as well to go in\nother countries with you, and there to take such part as ye do. My fair\nlords, said Sir Launcelot, I well understand you, and as I can, thank\nyou: and ye shall understand, such livelihood as I am born unto I shall\ndepart with you in this manner of wise; that is for to say, I shall\ndepart all my livelihood and all my lands freely among you, and I myself\nwill have as little as any of you, for have I sufficient that may long\nto my person, I will ask none other rich array; and I trust to God to\nmaintain you on my lands as well as ever were maintained any knights.\nThen spake all the knights at once: He have shame that will leave you;\nfor we all understand in this realm will be now no quiet, but ever\nstrife and debate, now the fellowship of the Round Table is broken; for\nby the noble fellowship of the Round Table was King Arthur upborne, and\nby their noblesse the king and all his realm was in quiet and rest, and\na great part they said all was because of your noblesse.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. How Sir Launcelot passed over the sea, and how he made\ngreat lords of the knights that went with him.\n\n\nTRULY, said Sir Launcelot, I thank you all of your good saying, howbeit,\nI wot well, in me was not all the stability of this realm, but in that\nI might I did my devoir; and well I am sure I knew many rebellions in\nmy days that by me were peaced, and I trow we all shall hear of them in\nshort space, and that me sore repenteth. For ever I dread me, said Sir\nLauncelot, that Sir Mordred will make trouble, for he is passing envious\nand applieth him to trouble. So they were accorded to go with Sir\nLauncelot to his lands; and to make short tale, they trussed, and paid\nall that would ask them; and wholly an hundred knights departed with Sir\nLauncelot at once, and made their avows they would never leave him for\nweal nor for woe.\n\nAnd so they shipped at Cardiff, and sailed unto Benwick: some men call\nit Bayonne, and some men call it Beaune, where the wine of Beaune is.\nBut to say the sooth, Sir Launcelot and his nephews were lords of all\nFrance, and of all the lands that longed unto France; he and his kindred\nrejoiced it all through Sir Launcelot's noble prowess. And then Sir\nLauncelot stuffed and furnished and garnished all his noble towns and\ncastles. Then all the people of those lands came to Sir Launcelot on\nfoot and hands. And so when he had stablished all these countries, he\nshortly called a parliament; and there he crowned Sir Lionel, King of\nFrance; and Sir Bors [he] crowned him king of all King Claudas' lands;\nand Sir Ector de Maris, that was Sir Launcelot's youngest brother,\nhe crowned him King of Benwick, and king of all Guienne, that was Sir\nLauncelot's own land. And he made Sir Ector prince of them all, and thus\nhe departed.\n\nThen Sir Launcelot advanced all his noble knights, and first he advanced\nthem of his blood; that was Sir Blamore, he made him Duke of Limosin\nin Guienne and Sir Bleoberis he made him Duke of Poictiers, and Sir\nGahalantine he made him Duke of Querne, and Sir Galihodin he made him\nDuke of Sentonge, and Sir Galihud he made him Earl of Perigot, and Sir\nMenadeuke he made him Earl of Roerge, and Sir Villiars the Valiant he\nmade him Earl of Bearn, and Sir Hebes le Renoumes he made him Earl of\nComange, and Sir Lavaine he made him Earl of Arminak, and Sir Urre he\nmade him Earl of Estrake, and Sir Neroneus he made him Earl of Pardiak,\nand Sir Plenorius he made Earl of Foise, and Sir Selises of the Dolorous\nTower he made him Earl of Masauke, and Sir Melias de Lile he made him\nEarl of Tursauk, and Sir Bellangere le Beuse he made Earl of the Launds,\nand Sir Palomides he made him Duke of the Provence, and Sir Safere\nhe made him Duke of Landok, and Sir Clegis he gave him the Earldom of\nAgente, and Sir Sadok he gave the Earldom of Surlat, and Sir Dinas le\nSeneschal he made him Duke of Anjou, and Sir Clarrus he made him Duke of\nNormandy. Thus Sir Launcelot rewarded his noble knights and many more,\nthat meseemeth it were too long to rehearse.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. How King Arthur and Sir Gawaine made a great host ready to\ngo over sea to make war on Sir Launcelot.\n\n\nSO leave we Sir Launcelot in his lands, and his noble knights with him,\nand return we again unto King Arthur and to Sir Gawaine, that made a\ngreat host ready, to the number of threescore thousand; and all thing\nwas made ready for their shipping to pass over the sea, and so they\nshipped at Cardiff. And there King Arthur made Sir Mordred chief ruler\nof all England, and also he put Queen Guenever under his governance;\nbecause Sir Mordred was King Arthur's son, he gave him the rule of his\nland and of his wife; and so the king passed the sea and landed upon Sir\nLauncelot's lands, and there he brent and wasted, through the vengeance\nof Sir Gawaine, all that they might overrun.\n\nWhen this word came to Sir Launcelot, that King Arthur and Sir Gawaine\nwere landed upon his lands, and made a full great destruction and waste,\nthen spake Sir Bors, and said: My lord Sir Launcelot, it is shame that\nwe suffer them thus to ride over our lands, for wit you well, suffer ye\nthem as long as ye will, they will do you no favour an they may handle\nyou. Then said Sir Lionel that was wary and wise: My lord Sir Launcelot,\nI will give this counsel, let us keep our strong walled towns until they\nhave hunger and cold, and blow on their nails; and then let us freshly\nset upon them, and shred them down as sheep in a field, that aliens may\ntake example for ever how they land upon our lands.\n\nThen spake King Bagdemagus to Sir Launcelot: Sir, your courtesy will\nshende us all, and thy courtesy hath waked all this sorrow; for an they\nthus over our lands ride, they shall by process bring us all to\nnought whilst we thus in holes us hide. Then said Sir Galihud unto Sir\nLauncelot: Sir, here be knights come of kings' blood, that will not long\ndroop, and they are within these walls; therefore give us leave, like as\nwe be knights, to meet them in the field, and we shall slay them, that\nthey shall curse the time that ever they came into this country. Then\nspake seven brethren of North Wales, and they were seven noble knights;\na man might seek in seven kings' lands or he might find such seven\nknights. Then they all said at once: Sir Launcelot, for Christ's sake\nlet us out ride with Sir Galihud, for we be never wont to cower in\ncastles nor in noble towns.\n\nThen spake Sir Launcelot, that was master and governor of them all: My\nfair lords, wit you well I am full loath to ride out with my knights for\nshedding of Christian blood; and yet my lands I understand be full bare\nfor to sustain any host awhile, for the mighty wars that whilom made\nKing Claudas upon this country, upon my father King Ban, and on mine\nuncle King Bors; howbeit we will as at this time keep our strong walls,\nand I shall send a messenger unto my lord Arthur, a treaty for to take;\nfor better is peace than always war.\n\nSo Sir Launcelot sent forth a damosel and a dwarf with her, requiring\nKing Arthur to leave his warring upon his lands; and so she start upon\na palfrey, and the dwarf ran by her side. And when she came to the\npavilion of King Arthur, there she alighted; and there met her a gentle\nknight, Sir Lucan the Butler, and said: Fair damosel, come ye from Sir\nLauncelot du Lake? Yea sir, she said, therefore I come hither to speak\nwith my lord the king. Alas, said Sir Lucan, my lord Arthur would love\nLauncelot, but Sir Gawaine will not suffer him. And then he said: I pray\nto God, damosel, ye may speed well, for all we that be about the king\nwould Sir Launcelot did best of any knight living. And so with this\nLucan led the damosel unto the king where he sat with Sir Gawaine, for\nto hear what she would say. So when she had told her tale, the water ran\nout of the king's eyen, and all the lords were full glad for to advise\nthe king as to be accorded with Sir Launcelot, save all only Sir\nGawaine, and he said: My lord mine uncle, what will ye do? Will ye now\nturn again, now ye are passed thus far upon this journey? all the\nworld will speak of your villainy. Nay, said Arthur, wit thou well, Sir\nGawaine, I will do as ye will advise me; and yet meseemeth, said Arthur,\nhis fair proffers were not good to be refused; but sithen I am come so\nfar upon this journey, I will that ye give the damosel her answer, for I\nmay not speak to her for pity, for her proffers be so large.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. What message Sir Gawaine sent to Sir Launcelot; and how King\nArthur laid siege to Benwick, and other matters.\n\n\nTHEN Sir Gawaine said to the damosel thus: Damosel, say ye to Sir\nLauncelot that it is waste labour now to sue to mine uncle; for tell\nhim, an he would have made any labour for peace, he should have made\nit or this time, for tell him now it is too late; and say that I, Sir\nGawaine, so send him word, that I promise him by the faith I owe unto\nGod and to knighthood, I shall never leave him till he have slain me\nor I him. So the damosel wept and departed, and there were many weeping\neyen; and so Sir Lucan brought the damosel to her palfrey, and so she\ncame to Sir Launcelot where he was among all his knights. And when Sir\nLauncelot had heard this answer, then the tears ran down by his cheeks.\nAnd then his noble knights strode about him, and said: Sir Launcelot,\nwherefore make ye such cheer, think what ye are, and what men we are,\nand let us noble knights match them in midst of the field. That may be\nlightly done, said Sir Launcelot, but I was never so loath to do battle,\nand therefore I pray you, fair sirs, as ye love me, be ruled as I will\nhave you, for I will always flee that noble king that made me knight.\nAnd when I may no further, I must needs defend me, and that will be more\nworship for me and us all than to compare with that noble king whom we\nhave all served. Then they held their language, and as that night they\ntook their rest.\n\nAnd upon the morn early, in the dawning of the day, as knights looked\nout, they saw the city of Benwick besieged round about; and fast they\nbegan to set up ladders, and then they defied them out of the town, and\nbeat them from the walls wightly. Then came forth Sir Gawaine well armed\nupon a stiff steed, and he came before the chief gate, with his spear\nin his hand, crying: Sir Launcelot, where art thou? is there none of you\nproud knights dare break a spear with me? Then Sir Bors made him ready,\nand came forth out of the town, and there Sir Gawaine encountered with\nSir Bors. And at that time he smote Sir Bors down from his horse, and\nalmost he had slain him; and so Sir Bors was rescued and borne into the\ntown. Then came forth Sir Lionel, brother to Sir Bors, and thought to\nrevenge him; and either feutred their spears, and ran together; and\nthere they met spitefully, but Sir Gawaine had such grace that he smote\nSir Lionel down, and wounded him there passing sore; and then Sir Lionel\nwas rescued and borne into the town. And this Sir Gawaine came every\nday, and he failed not but that he smote down one knight or other.\n\nSo thus they endured half a year, and much slaughter was of people on\nboth parties. Then it befell upon a day, Sir Gawaine came afore the\ngates armed at all pieces on a noble horse, with a great spear in his\nhand; and then he cried with a loud voice: Where art thou now, thou\nfalse traitor, Sir Launcelot? Why hidest thou thyself within holes and\nwalls like a coward? Look out now, thou false traitor knight, and here\nI shall revenge upon thy body the death of my three brethren. All this\nlanguage heard Sir Launcelot every deal; and his kin and his knights\ndrew about him, and all they said at once to Sir Launcelot: Sir\nLauncelot, now must ye defend you like a knight, or else ye be shamed\nfor ever; for, now ye be called upon treason, it is time for you to\nstir, for ye have slept over-long and suffered over-much. So God me\nhelp, said Sir Launcelot, I am right heavy of Sir Gawaine's words, for\nnow he charged me with a great charge; and therefore I wot it as well as\nye, that I must defend me, or else to be recreant.\n\nThen Sir Launcelot bade saddle his strongest horse, and bade let\nfetch his arms, and bring all unto the gate of the tower; and then Sir\nLauncelot spake on high unto King Arthur, and said: My lord Arthur, and\nnoble king that made me knight, wit you well I am right heavy for your\nsake, that ye thus sue upon me; and always I forbare you, for an I would\nhave been vengeable, I might have met you in midst of the field, and\nthere to have made your boldest knights full tame. And now I have\nforborne half a year, and suffered you and Sir Gawaine to do what ye\nwould do; and now may I endure it no longer, for now must I needs defend\nmyself, insomuch Sir Gawaine hath appealed me of treason; the which is\ngreatly against my will that ever I should fight against any of your\nblood, but now I may not forsake it, I am driven thereto as a beast till\na bay.\n\nThen Sir Gawaine said: Sir Launcelot, an thou durst do battle, leave thy\nbabbling and come off, and let us ease our hearts. Then Sir Launcelot\narmed him lightly, and mounted upon his horse, and either of the knights\ngat great spears in their hands, and the host without stood still all\napart, and the noble knights came out of the city by a great number,\ninsomuch that when Arthur saw the number of men and knights, he\nmarvelled, and said to himself: Alas, that ever Sir Launcelot was\nagainst me, for now I see he hath forborne me. And so the covenant was\nmade, there should no man nigh them, nor deal with them, till the one\nwere dead or yelden.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. How Sir Launcelot and Sir Gawaine did battle together, and\nhow Sir Gawaine was overthrown and hurt.\n\n\nTHEN Sir Gawaine and Sir Launcelot departed a great way asunder, and\nthen they came together with all their horses' might as they might run,\nand either smote other in midst of their shields; but the knights were\nso strong, and their spears so big, that their horses might not endure\ntheir buffets, and so their horses fell to the earth; and then they\navoided their horses, and dressed their shields afore them. Then they\nstood together and gave many sad strokes on divers places of their\nbodies, that the blood brast out on many sides and places. Then had Sir\nGawaine such a grace and gift that an holy man had given to him, that\nevery day in the year, from underne till high noon, his might increased\nthose three hours as much as thrice his strength, and that caused\nSir Gawaine to win great honour. And for his sake King Arthur made an\nordinance, that all manner of battles for any quarrels that should be\ndone afore King Arthur should begin at underne; and all was done for Sir\nGawaine's love, that by likelihood, if Sir Gawaine were on the one part,\nhe should have the better in battle while his strength endureth three\nhours; but there were but few knights that time living that knew this\nadvantage that Sir Gawaine had, but King Arthur all only.\n\nThus Sir Launcelot fought with Sir Gawaine, and when Sir Launcelot felt\nhis might evermore increase, Sir Launcelot wondered and dread him sore\nto be shamed. For as the French book saith, Sir Launcelot weened, when\nhe felt Sir Gawaine double his strength, that he had been a fiend and\nnone earthly man; wherefore Sir Launcelot traced and traversed, and\ncovered himself with his shield, and kept his might and his braide\nduring three hours; and that while Sir Gawaine gave him many sad brunts,\nand many sad strokes, that all the knights that beheld Sir Launcelot\nmarvelled how that he might endure him; but full little understood they\nthat travail that Sir Launcelot had for to endure him. And then when\nit was past noon Sir Gawaine had no more but his own might. When Sir\nLauncelot felt him so come down, then he stretched him up and stood\nnear Sir Gawaine, and said thus: My lord Sir Gawaine, now I feel ye have\ndone; now my lord Sir Gawaine, I must do my part, for many great and\ngrievous strokes I have endured you this day with great pain.\n\nThen Sir Launcelot doubled his strokes and gave Sir Gawaine such a\nbuffet on the helmet that he fell down on his side, and Sir Launcelot\nwithdrew him from him. Why withdrawest thou thee? said Sir Gawaine;\nnow turn again, false traitor knight, and slay me, for an thou leave me\nthus, when I am whole I shall do battle with thee again. I shall endure\nyou, Sir, by God's grace, but wit thou well, Sir Gawaine, I will never\nsmite a felled knight. And so Sir Launcelot went into the city; and Sir\nGawaine was borne into King Arthur's pavilion, and leeches were brought\nto him, and searched and salved with soft ointments. And then Sir\nLauncelot said: Now have good day, my lord the king, for wit you well ye\nwin no worship at these walls; and if I would my knights outbring, there\nshould many a man die. Therefore, my lord Arthur, remember you of old\nkindness; and however I fare, Jesu be your guide in all places.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. Of the sorrow that King Arthur made for the war, and of\nanother battle where also Sir Gawaine had the worse.\n\n\nALAS, said the king, that ever this unhappy war was begun; for ever Sir\nLauncelot forbeareth me in all places, and in likewise my kin, and that\nis seen well this day by my nephew Sir Gawaine. Then King Arthur fell\nsick for sorrow of Sir Gawaine, that he was so sore hurt, and because\nof the war betwixt him and Sir Launcelot. So then they on King Arthur's\npart kept the siege with little war withoutforth; and they withinforth\nkept their walls, and defended them when need was. Thus Sir Gawaine lay\nsick three weeks in his tents, with all manner of leech-craft that might\nbe had. And as soon as Sir Gawaine might go and ride, he armed him at\nall points, and start upon a courser, and gat a spear in his hand, and\nso he came riding afore the chief gate of Benwick; and there he cried\non height: Where art thou, Sir Launcelot? Come forth, thou false traitor\nknight and recreant, for I am here, Sir Gawaine, will prove this that I\nsay on thee.\n\nAll this language Sir Launcelot heard, and then he said thus: Sir\nGawaine, me repents of your foul saying, that ye will not cease of your\nlanguage; for you wot well, Sir Gawaine, I know your might and all that\nye may do; and well ye wot, Sir Gawaine, ye may not greatly hurt me.\nCome down, traitor knight, said he, and make it good the contrary with\nthy hands, for it mishapped me the last battle to be hurt of thy hands;\ntherefore wit thou well I am come this day to make amends, for I ween\nthis day to lay thee as low as thou laidest me. Jesu defend me, said Sir\nLauncelot, that ever I be so far in your danger as ye have been in mine,\nfor then my days were done. But Sir Gawaine, said Sir Launcelot, ye\nshall not think that I tarry long, but sithen that ye so unknightly call\nme of treason, ye shall have both your hands full of me. And then Sir\nLauncelot armed him at all points, and mounted upon his horse, and gat\na great spear in his hand, and rode out at the gate. And both the hosts\nwere assembled, of them without and of them within, and stood in array\nfull manly. And both parties were charged to hold them still, to see and\nbehold the battle of these two noble knights. And then they laid their\nspears in their rests, and they came together as thunder, and Sir\nGawaine brake his spear upon Sir Launcelot in a hundred pieces unto\nhis hand; and Sir Launcelot smote him with a greater might, that Sir\nGawaine's horse's feet raised, and so the horse and he fell to the\nearth. Then Sir Gawaine deliverly avoided his horse, and put his shield\nafore him, and eagerly drew his sword, and bade Sir Launcelot: Alight,\ntraitor knight, for if this mare's son hath failed me, wit thou well a\nking's son and a queen's son shall not fail thee.\n\nThen Sir Launcelot avoided his horse, and dressed his shield afore\nhim, and drew his sword; and so stood they together and gave many sad\nstrokes, that all men on both parties had thereof passing great\nwonder. But when Sir Launcelot felt Sir Gawaine's might so marvellously\nincrease, he then withheld his courage and his wind, and kept himself\nwonder covert of his might; and under his shield he traced and traversed\nhere and there, to break Sir Gawaine's strokes and his courage; and Sir\nGawaine enforced himself with all his might and power to destroy Sir\nLauncelot; for as the French book saith, ever as Sir Gawaine's might\nincreased, right so increased his wind and his evil will. Thus Sir\nGawaine did great pain unto Sir Launcelot three hours, that he had right\ngreat pain for to defend him.\n\nAnd when the three hours were passed, that Sir Launcelot felt that Sir\nGawaine was come to his own proper strength, then Sir Launcelot said\nunto Sir Gawaine: Now have I proved you twice, that ye are a full\ndangerous knight, and a wonderful man of your might; and many wonderful\ndeeds have ye done in your days, for by your might increasing you have\ndeceived many a full noble and valiant knight; and, now I feel that ye\nhave done your mighty deeds, now wit you well I must do my deeds.\nAnd then Sir Launcelot stood near Sir Gawaine, and then Sir Launcelot\ndoubled his strokes; and Sir Gawaine defended him mightily, but\nnevertheless Sir Launcelot smote such a stroke upon Sir Gawaine's helm,\nand upon the old wound, that Sir Gawaine sinked down upon his one\nside in a swoon. And anon as he did awake he waved and foined at Sir\nLauncelot as he lay, and said: Traitor knight, wit thou well I am not\nyet slain, come thou near me and perform this battle unto the uttermost.\nI will no more do than I have done, said Sir Launcelot, for when I see\nyou on foot I will do battle upon you all the while I see you stand on\nyour feet; but for to smite a wounded man that may not stand, God defend\nme from such a shame. And then he turned him and went his way toward the\ncity. And Sir Gawaine evermore calling him traitor knight, and said:\nWit thou well Sir Launcelot, when I am whole I shall do battle with thee\nagain, for I shall never leave thee till that one of us be slain. Thus\nas this siege endured, and as Sir Gawaine lay sick near a month; and\nwhen he was well recovered and ready within three days to do battle\nagain with Sir Launcelot, right so came tidings unto Arthur from England\nthat made King Arthur and all his host to remove.\n\n_Here followeth the xxi. book._\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XXI.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. How Sir Mordred presumed and took on him to be King of\nEngland, and would have married the queen, his father's wife.\n\n\nAS Sir Mordred was ruler of all England, he did do make letters as\nthough that they came from beyond the sea, and the letters specified\nthat King Arthur was slain in battle with Sir Launcelot. Wherefore Sir\nMordred made a parliament, and called the lords together, and there he\nmade them to choose him king; and so was he crowned at Canterbury,\nand held a feast there fifteen days; and afterward he drew him unto\nWinchester, and there he took the Queen Guenever, and said plainly that\nhe would wed her which was his uncle's wife and his father's wife. And\nso he made ready for the feast, and a day prefixed that they should be\nwedded; wherefore Queen Guenever was passing heavy. But she durst not\ndiscover her heart, but spake fair, and agreed to Sir Mordred's will.\nThen she desired of Sir Mordred for to go to London, to buy all manner\nof things that longed unto the wedding. And because of her fair speech\nSir Mordred trusted her well enough, and gave her leave to go. And so\nwhen she came to London she took the Tower of London, and suddenly in\nall haste possible she stuffed it with all manner of victual, and well\ngarnished it with men, and so kept it.\n\nThen when Sir Mordred wist and understood how he was beguiled, he was\npassing wroth out of measure. And a short tale for to make, he went\nand laid a mighty siege about the Tower of London, and made many great\nassaults thereat, and threw many great engines unto them, and shot great\nguns. But all might not prevail Sir Mordred, for Queen Guenever would\nnever for fair speech nor for foul, would never trust to come in his\nhands again.\n\nThen came the Bishop of Canterbury, the which was a noble clerk and an\nholy man, and thus he said to Sir Mordred: Sir, what will ye do? will\nye first displease God and sithen shame yourself, and all knighthood? Is\nnot King Arthur your uncle, no farther but your mother's brother, and on\nher himself King Arthur begat you upon his own sister, therefore how\nmay you wed your father's wife? Sir, said the noble clerk, leave this\nopinion or I shall curse you with book and bell and candle. Do thou thy\nworst, said Sir Mordred, wit thou well I shall defy thee. Sir, said the\nBishop, and wit you well I shall not fear me to do that me ought to do.\nAlso where ye noise where my lord Arthur is slain, and that is not so,\nand therefore ye will make a foul work in this land. Peace, thou false\npriest, said Sir Mordred, for an thou chafe me any more I shall make\nstrike off thy head. So the Bishop departed and did the cursing in the\nmost orgulist wise that might be done. And then Sir Mordred sought the\nBishop of Canterbury, for to have slain him. Then the Bishop fled, and\ntook part of his goods with him, and went nigh unto Glastonbury; and\nthere he was as priest hermit in a chapel, and lived in poverty and in\nholy prayers, for well he understood that mischievous war was at hand.\n\nThen Sir Mordred sought on Queen Guenever by letters and sonds, and by\nfair means and foul means, for to have her to come out of the Tower of\nLondon; but all this availed not, for she answered him shortly, openly\nand privily, that she had liefer slay herself than to be married with\nhim. Then came word to Sir Mordred that King Arthur had araised the\nsiege for Sir Launcelot, and he was coming homeward with a great host,\nto be avenged upon Sir Mordred; wherefore Sir Mordred made write writs\nto all the barony of this land, and much people drew to him. For then\nwas the common voice among them that with Arthur was none other life but\nwar and strife, and with Sir Mordred was great joy and bliss. Thus was\nSir Arthur depraved, and evil said of. And many there were that King\nArthur had made up of nought, and given them lands, might not then say\nhim a good word. Lo ye all Englishmen, see ye not what a mischief here\nwas! for he that was the most king and knight of the world, and\nmost loved the fellowship of noble knights, and by him they were all\nupholden, now might not these Englishmen hold them content with him. Lo\nthus was the old custom and usage of this land; and also men say that\nwe of this land have not yet lost nor forgotten that custom and usage.\nAlas, this is a great default of us Englishmen, for there may no thing\nplease us no term. And so fared the people at that time, they were\nbetter pleased with Sir Mordred than they were with King Arthur; and\nmuch people drew unto Sir Mordred, and said they would abide with him\nfor better and for worse. And so Sir Mordred drew with a great host to\nDover, for there he heard say that Sir Arthur would arrive, and so he\nthought to beat his own father from his lands; and the most part of all\nEngland held with Sir Mordred, the people were so new-fangle.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. How after that King Arthur had tidings, he returned and came\nto Dover, where Sir Mordred met him to let his landing; and of the death\nof Sir Gawaine.\n\n\nAND so as Sir Mordred was at Dover with his host, there came King Arthur\nwith a great navy of ships, and galleys, and carracks. And there was Sir\nMordred ready awaiting upon his landing, to let his own father to land\nupon the land that he was king over. Then there was launching of great\nboats and small, and full of noble men of arms; and there was much\nslaughter of gentle knights, and many a full bold baron was laid full\nlow, on both parties. But King Arthur was so courageous that there might\nno manner of knights let him to land, and his knights fiercely followed\nhim; and so they landed maugre Sir Mordred and all his power, and put\nSir Mordred aback, that he fled and all his people.\n\nSo when this battle was done, King Arthur let bury his people that were\ndead. And then was noble Sir Gawaine found in a great boat, lying more\nthan half dead When Sir Arthur wist that Sir Gawaine was laid so low; he\nwent unto him; and there the king made sorrow out of measure, and took\nSir Gawaine in his arms, and thrice he there swooned. And then when\nhe awaked, he said: Alas, Sir Gawaine, my sister's son, here now thou\nliest; the man in the world that I loved most; and now is my joy gone,\nfor now, my nephew Sir Gawaine, I will discover me unto your person: in\nSir Launcelot and you I most had my joy, and mine affiance, and now have\nI lost my joy of you both; wherefore all mine earthly joy is gone from\nme. Mine uncle King Arthur, said Sir Gawaine, wit you well my death-day\nis come, and all is through mine own hastiness and wilfulness; for I am\nsmitten upon the old wound the which Sir Launcelot gave me, on the which\nI feel well I must die; and had Sir Launcelot been with you as he was,\nthis unhappy war had never begun; and of all this am I causer, for Sir\nLauncelot and his blood, through their prowess, held all your cankered\nenemies in subjection and daunger. And now, said Sir Gawaine, ye\nshall miss Sir Launcelot. But alas, I would not accord with him, and\ntherefore, said Sir Gawaine, I pray you, fair uncle, that I may have\npaper, pen, and ink, that I may write to Sir Launcelot a cedle with mine\nown hands.\n\nAnd then when paper and ink was brought, then Gawaine was set up weakly\nby King Arthur, for he was shriven a little to-fore; and then he wrote\nthus, as the French book maketh mention: Unto Sir Launcelot, flower\nof all noble knights that ever I heard of or saw by my days, I, Sir\nGawaine, King Lot's son of Orkney, sister's son unto the noble King\nArthur, send thee greeting, and let thee have knowledge that the tenth\nday of May I was smitten upon the old wound that thou gavest me afore\nthe city of Benwick, and through the same wound that thou gavest me I\nam come to my death-day. And I will that all the world wit, that I, Sir\nGawaine, knight of the Table Round, sought my death, and not through thy\ndeserving, but it was mine own seeking; wherefore I beseech thee, Sir\nLauncelot, to return again unto this realm, and see my tomb, and pray\nsome prayer more or less for my soul. And this same day that I wrote\nthis cedle, I was hurt to the death in the same wound, the which I had\nof thy hand, Sir Launcelot; for of a more nobler man might I not be\nslain. Also Sir Launcelot, for all the love that ever was betwixt us,\nmake no tarrying, but come over the sea in all haste, that thou mayst\nwith thy noble knights rescue that noble king that made thee knight,\nthat is my lord Arthur; for he is full straitly bestead with a false\ntraitor, that is my half-brother, Sir Mordred; and he hath let crown him\nking, and would have wedded my lady Queen Guenever, and so had he done\nhad she not put herself in the Tower of London. And so the tenth day of\nMay last past, my lord Arthur and we all landed upon them at Dover; and\nthere we put that false traitor, Sir Mordred, to flight, and there it\nmisfortuned me to be stricken upon thy stroke. And at the date of this\nletter was written, but two hours and a half afore my death, written\nwith mine own hand, and so subscribed with part of my heart's blood. And\nI require thee, most famous knight of the world, that thou wilt see my\ntomb. And then Sir Gawaine wept, and King Arthur wept; and then they\nswooned both. And when they awaked both, the king made Sir Gawaine to\nreceive his Saviour. And then Sir Gawaine prayed the king for to send\nfor Sir Launcelot, and to cherish him above all other knights.\n\nAnd so at the hour of noon Sir Gawaine yielded up the spirit; and then\nthe king let inter him in a chapel within Dover Castle; and there yet\nall men may see the skull of him, and the same wound is seen that Sir\nLauncelot gave him in battle. Then was it told the king that Sir Mordred\nhad pight a new field upon Barham Down. And upon the morn the king rode\nthither to him, and there was a great battle betwixt them, and much\npeople was slain on both parties; but at the last Sir Arthur's party\nstood best, and Sir Mordred and his party fled unto Canterbury.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. How after, Sir Gawaine's ghost appeared to King Arthur, and\nwarned him that he should not fight that day.\n\n\nAND then the king let search all the towns for his knights that were\nslain, and interred them; and salved them with soft salves that so sore\nwere wounded. Then much people drew unto King Arthur. And then they\nsaid that Sir Mordred warred upon King Arthur with wrong. And then\nKing Arthur drew him with his host down by the seaside, westward toward\nSalisbury; and there was a day assigned betwixt King Arthur and Sir\nMordred, that they should meet upon a down beside Salisbury, and not far\nfrom the seaside; and this day was assigned on a Monday after Trinity\nSunday, whereof King Arthur was passing glad, that he might be avenged\nupon Sir Mordred. Then Sir Mordred araised much people about London,\nfor they of Kent, Southsex, and Surrey, Estsex, and of Southfolk, and\nof Northfolk, held the most part with Sir Mordred; and many a full noble\nknight drew unto Sir Mordred and to the king: but they that loved Sir\nLauncelot drew unto Sir Mordred.\n\nSo upon Trinity Sunday at night, King Arthur dreamed a wonderful dream,\nand that was this: that him seemed he sat upon a chaflet in a chair,\nand the chair was fast to a wheel, and thereupon sat King Arthur in the\nrichest cloth of gold that might be made; and the king thought there was\nunder him, far from him, an hideous deep black water, and therein were\nall manner of serpents, and worms, and wild beasts, foul and horrible;\nand suddenly the king thought the wheel turned up-so-down, and he fell\namong the serpents, and every beast took him by a limb; and then the\nking cried as he lay in his bed and slept: Help. And then knights,\nsquires, and yeomen, awaked the king; and then he was so amazed that he\nwist not where he was; and then he fell a-slumbering again, not sleeping\nnor thoroughly waking. So the king seemed verily that there came Sir\nGawaine unto him with a number of fair ladies with him. And when King\nArthur saw him, then he said: Welcome, my sister's son; I weened thou\nhadst been dead, and now I see thee alive, much am I beholding unto\nAlmighty Jesu. O fair nephew and my sister's son, what be these ladies\nthat hither be come with you? Sir, said Sir Gawaine, all these be ladies\nfor whom I have foughten when I was man living, and all these are those\nthat I did battle for in righteous quarrel; and God hath given them that\ngrace at their great prayer, because I did battle for them, that they\nshould bring me hither unto you: thus much hath God given me leave, for\nto warn you of your death; for an ye fight as to-morn with Sir Mordred,\nas ye both have assigned, doubt ye not ye must be slain, and the\nmost part of your people on both parties. And for the great grace and\ngoodness that almighty Jesu hath unto you, and for pity of you, and many\nmore other good men there shall be slain, God hath sent me to you of\nhis special grace, to give you warning that in no wise ye do battle\nas to-morn, but that ye take a treaty for a month day; and proffer you\nlargely, so as to-morn to be put in a delay. For within a month\nshall come Sir Launcelot with all his noble knights, and rescue you\nworshipfully, and slay Sir Mordred, and all that ever will hold with\nhim. Then Sir Gawaine and all the ladies vanished.\n\nAnd anon the king called upon his knights, squires, and yeomen, and\ncharged them wightly to fetch his noble lords and wise bishops unto\nhim. And when they were come, the king told them his avision, what Sir\nGawaine had told him, and warned him that if he fought on the morn he\nshould be slain. Then the king commanded Sir Lucan the Butler, and his\nbrother Sir Bedivere, with two bishops with them, and charged them in\nany wise, an they might, Take a treaty for a month day with Sir Mordred,\nand spare not, proffer him lands and goods as much as ye think best. So\nthen they departed, and came to Sir Mordred, where he had a grim host of\nan hundred thousand men. And there they entreated Sir Mordred long time;\nand at the last Sir Mordred was agreed for to have Cornwall and Kent, by\nArthur's days: after, all England, after the days of King Arthur.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. How by misadventure of an adder the battle began, where\nMordred was slain, and Arthur hurt to the death.\n\n\nTHEN were they condescended that King Arthur and Sir Mordred should\nmeet betwixt both their hosts, and everych of them should bring fourteen\npersons; and they came with this word unto Arthur. Then said he: I am\nglad that this is done: and so he went into the field. And when Arthur\nshould depart, he warned all his host that an they see any sword drawn:\nLook ye come on fiercely, and slay that traitor, Sir Mordred, for I in\nno wise trust him. In like wise Sir Mordred warned his host that: An ye\nsee any sword drawn, look that ye come on fiercely, and so slay all\nthat ever before you standeth; for in no wise I will not trust for this\ntreaty, for I know well my father will be avenged on me. And so they\nmet as their appointment was, and so they were agreed and accorded\nthoroughly; and wine was fetched, and they drank. Right soon came an\nadder out of a little heath bush, and it stung a knight on the foot. And\nwhen the knight felt him stung, he looked down and saw the adder, and\nthen he drew his sword to slay the adder, and thought of none other\nharm. And when the host on both parties saw that sword drawn, then they\nblew beams, trumpets, and horns, and shouted grimly. And so both hosts\ndressed them together. And King Arthur took his horse, and said: Alas\nthis unhappy day! and so rode to his party. And Sir Mordred in like\nwise. And never was there seen a more dolefuller battle in no Christian\nland; for there was but rushing and riding, foining and striking, and\nmany a grim word was there spoken either to other, and many a deadly\nstroke. But ever King Arthur rode throughout the battle of Sir Mordred\nmany times, and did full nobly as a noble king should, and at all times\nhe fainted never; and Sir Mordred that day put him in devoir, and in\ngreat peril. And thus they fought all the long day, and never stinted\ntill the noble knights were laid to the cold earth; and ever they fought\nstill till it was near night, and by that time was there an hundred\nthousand laid dead upon the down. Then was Arthur wood wroth out of\nmeasure, when he saw his people so slain from him.\n\nThen the king looked about him, and then was he ware, of all his host\nand of all his good knights, were left no more alive but two knights;\nthat one was Sir Lucan the Butler, and his brother Sir Bedivere, and\nthey were full sore wounded. Jesu mercy, said the king, where are all my\nnoble knights become? Alas that ever I should see this doleful day, for\nnow, said Arthur, I am come to mine end. But would to God that I wist\nwhere were that traitor Sir Mordred, that hath caused all this mischief.\nThen was King Arthur ware where Sir Mordred leaned upon his sword among\na great heap of dead men. Now give me my spear, said Arthur unto Sir\nLucan, for yonder I have espied the traitor that all this woe hath\nwrought. Sir, let him be, said Sir Lucan, for he is unhappy; and if ye\npass this unhappy day ye shall be right well revenged upon him. Good\nlord, remember ye of your night's dream, and what the spirit of\nSir Gawaine told you this night, yet God of his great goodness hath\npreserved you hitherto. Therefore, for God's sake, my lord, leave off\nby this, for blessed be God ye have won the field, for here we be three\nalive, and with Sir Mordred is none alive; and if ye leave off now this\nwicked day of destiny is past. Tide me death, betide me life, saith the\nking, now I see him yonder alone he shall never escape mine hands, for\nat a better avail shall I never have him. God speed you well, said Sir\nBedivere.\n\nThen the king gat his spear in both his hands, and ran toward Sir\nMordred, crying: Traitor, now is thy death-day come. And when Sir\nMordred heard Sir Arthur, he ran until him with his sword drawn in his\nhand. And there King Arthur smote Sir Mordred under the shield, with a\nfoin of his spear, throughout the body, more than a fathom. And when\nSir Mordred felt that he had his death wound he thrust himself with the\nmight that he had up to the bur of King Arthur's spear. And right so he\nsmote his father Arthur, with his sword holden in both his hands, on the\nside of the head, that the sword pierced the helmet and the brain-pan,\nand therewithal Sir Mordred fell stark dead to the earth; and the noble\nArthur fell in a swoon to the earth, and there he swooned ofttimes. And\nSir Lucan the Butler and Sir Bedivere ofttimes heaved him up. And so\nweakly they led him betwixt them both, to a little chapel not far from\nthe seaside. And when the king was there he thought him well eased.\n\nThen heard they people cry in the field. Now go thou, Sir Lucan, said\nthe king, and do me to wit what betokens that noise in the field. So Sir\nLucan departed, for he was grievously wounded in many places. And so\nas he yede, he saw and hearkened by the moonlight, how that pillers and\nrobbers were come into the field, to pill and to rob many a full noble\nknight of brooches, and beads, of many a good ring, and of many a rich\njewel; and who that were not dead all out, there they slew them for\ntheir harness and their riches. When Sir Lucan understood this work, he\ncame to the king as soon as he might, and told him all what he had heard\nand seen. Therefore by my rede, said Sir Lucan, it is best that we bring\nyou to some town. I would it were so, said the king.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. How King Arthur commanded to cast his sword Excalibur into\nthe water, and how he was delivered to ladies in a barge.\n\n\nBUT I may not stand, mine head works so. Ah Sir Launcelot, said King\nArthur, this day have I sore missed thee: alas, that ever I was against\nthee, for now have I my death, whereof Sir Gawaine me warned in my\ndream. Then Sir Lucan took up the king the one part, and Sir Bedivere\nthe other part, and in the lifting the king swooned; and Sir Lucan fell\nin a swoon with the lift, that the part of his guts fell out of his\nbody, and therewith the noble knight's heart brast. And when the king\nawoke, he beheld Sir Lucan, how he lay foaming at the mouth, and part\nof his guts lay at his feet. Alas, said the king, this is to me a full\nheavy sight, to see this noble duke so die for my sake, for he would\nhave holpen me, that had more need of help than I. Alas, he would not\ncomplain him, his heart was so set to help me: now Jesu have mercy upon\nhis soul! Then Sir Bedivere wept for the death of his brother. Leave\nthis mourning and weeping, said the king, for all this will not avail\nme, for wit thou well an I might live myself, the death of Sir Lucan\nwould grieve me evermore; but my time hieth fast, said the king.\nTherefore, said Arthur unto Sir Bedivere, take thou Excalibur, my good\nsword, and go with it to yonder water side, and when thou comest there\nI charge thee throw my sword in that water, and come again and tell me\nwhat thou there seest. My lord, said Bedivere, your commandment shall be\ndone, and lightly bring you word again.\n\nSo Sir Bedivere departed, and by the way he beheld that noble sword,\nthat the pommel and the haft was all of precious stones; and then he\nsaid to himself: If I throw this rich sword in the water, thereof shall\nnever come good, but harm and loss. And then Sir Bedivere hid Excalibur\nunder a tree. And so, as soon as he might, he came again unto the king,\nand said he had been at the water, and had thrown the sword in the\nwater. What saw thou there? said the king. Sir, he said, I saw nothing\nbut waves and winds. That is untruly said of thee, said the king,\ntherefore go thou lightly again, and do my commandment; as thou art to\nme lief and dear, spare not, but throw it in. Then Sir Bedivere returned\nagain, and took the sword in his hand; and then him thought sin and\nshame to throw away that noble sword, and so eft he hid the sword, and\nreturned again, and told to the king that he had been at the water, and\ndone his commandment. What saw thou there? said the king. Sir, he said,\nI saw nothing but the waters wap and waves wan. Ah, traitor untrue,\nsaid King Arthur, now hast thou betrayed me twice. Who would have weened\nthat, thou that hast been to me so lief and dear? and thou art named a\nnoble knight, and would betray me for the richness of the sword. But now\ngo again lightly, for thy long tarrying putteth me in great jeopardy of\nmy life, for I have taken cold. And but if thou do now as I bid thee,\nif ever I may see thee, I shall slay thee with mine own hands; for thou\nwouldst for my rich sword see me dead.\n\nThen Sir Bedivere departed, and went to the sword, and lightly took it\nup, and went to the water side; and there he bound the girdle about the\nhilts, and then he threw the sword as far into the water as he might;\nand there came an arm and an hand above the water and met it, and caught\nit, and so shook it thrice and brandished, and then vanished away the\nhand with the sword in the water. So Sir Bedivere came again to the\nking, and told him what he saw. Alas, said the king, help me hence, for\nI dread me I have tarried over long. Then Sir Bedivere took the king\nupon his back, and so went with him to that water side. And when they\nwere at the water side, even fast by the bank hoved a little barge with\nmany fair ladies in it, and among them all was a queen, and all they had\nblack hoods, and all they wept and shrieked when they saw King Arthur.\nNow put me into the barge, said the king. And so he did softly; and\nthere received him three queens with great mourning; and so they set\nthem down, and in one of their laps King Arthur laid his head. And then\nthat queen said: Ah, dear brother, why have ye tarried so long from me?\nalas, this wound on your head hath caught over-much cold. And so then\nthey rowed from the land, and Sir Bedivere beheld all those ladies go\nfrom him. Then Sir Bedivere cried: Ah my lord Arthur, what shall become\nof me, now ye go from me and leave me here alone among mine enemies?\nComfort thyself, said the king, and do as well as thou mayst, for in me\nis no trust for to trust in; for I will into the vale of Avilion to heal\nme of my grievous wound: and if thou hear never more of me, pray for my\nsoul. But ever the queens and ladies wept and shrieked, that it was pity\nto hear. And as soon as Sir Bedivere had lost the sight of the barge, he\nwept and wailed, and so took the forest; and so he went all that night,\nand in the morning he was ware betwixt two holts hoar, of a chapel and\nan hermitage.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. How Sir Bedivere found him on the morrow dead in an\nhermitage, and how he abode there with the hermit.\n\n\nTHEN was Sir Bedivere glad, and thither he went; and when he came into\nthe chapel, he saw where lay an hermit grovelling on all four, there\nfast by a tomb was new graven. When the hermit saw Sir Bedivere he knew\nhim well, for he was but little to-fore Bishop of Canterbury, that Sir\nMordred flemed. Sir, said Bedivere, what man is there interred that ye\npray so fast for? Fair son, said the hermit, I wot not verily, but by\ndeeming. But this night, at midnight, here came a number of ladies, and\nbrought hither a dead corpse, and prayed me to bury him; and here they\noffered an hundred tapers, and they gave me an hundred besants. Alas,\nsaid Sir Bedivere, that was my lord King Arthur, that here lieth buried\nin this chapel. Then Sir Bedivere swooned; and when he awoke he prayed\nthe hermit he might abide with him still there, to live with fasting and\nprayers. For from hence will I never go, said Sir Bedivere, by my will,\nbut all the days of my life here to pray for my lord Arthur. Ye are\nwelcome to me, said the hermit, for I know ye better than ye ween that\nI do. Ye are the bold Bedivere, and the full noble duke, Sir Lucan the\nButler, was your brother. Then Sir Bedivere told the hermit all as ye\nhave heard to-fore. So there bode Sir Bedivere with the hermit that was\nto-fore Bishop of Canterbury, and there Sir Bedivere put upon him poor\nclothes, and served the hermit full lowly in fasting and in prayers.\n\nThus of Arthur I find never more written in books that be authorised,\nnor more of the very certainty of his death heard I never read, but thus\nwas he led away in a ship wherein were three queens; that one was\nKing Arthur's sister, Queen Morgan le Fay; the other was the Queen of\nNorthgalis; the third was the Queen of the Waste Lands. Also there was\nNimue, the chief lady of the lake, that had wedded Pelleas the good\nknight; and this lady had done much for King Arthur, for she would never\nsuffer Sir Pelleas to be in no place where he should be in danger of\nhis life; and so he lived to the uttermost of his days with her in great\nrest. More of the death of King Arthur could I never find, but that\nladies brought him to his burials; and such one was buried there, that\nthe hermit bare witness that sometime was Bishop of Canterbury, but\nyet the hermit knew not in certain that he was verily the body of King\nArthur: for this tale Sir Bedivere, knight of the Table Round, made it\nto be written.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. Of the opinion of some men of the death of King Arthur; and\nhow Queen Guenever made her a nun in Almesbury.\n\n\nYET some men say in many parts of England that King Arthur is not dead,\nbut had by the will of our Lord Jesu into another place; and men say\nthat he shall come again, and he shall win the holy cross. I will not\nsay it shall be so, but rather I will say: here in this world he changed\nhis life. But many men say that there is written upon his tomb this\nverse: _Hic jacet Arthurus, Rex quondam, Rexque futurus._ Thus leave I\nhere Sir Bedivere with the hermit, that dwelled that time in a chapel\nbeside Glastonbury, and there was his hermitage. And so they lived\nin their prayers, and fastings, and great abstinence. And when Queen\nGuenever understood that King Arthur was slain, and all the noble\nknights, Sir Mordred and all the remnant, then the queen stole away, and\nfive ladies with her, and so she went to Almesbury; and there she let\nmake herself a nun, and ware white clothes and black, and great penance\nshe took, as ever did sinful lady in this land, and never creature could\nmake her merry; but lived in fasting, prayers, and alms-deeds, that all\nmanner of people marvelled how virtuously she was changed. Now leave we\nQueen Guenever in Almesbury, a nun in white clothes and black, and there\nshe was Abbess and ruler as reason would; and turn we from her, and\nspeak we of Sir Launcelot du Lake.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. How when Sir Lancelot heard of the death of King Arthur,\nand of Sir Gawaine, and other matters, he came into England.\n\n\nAND when he heard in his country that Sir Mordred was crowned king in\nEngland, and made war against King Arthur, his own father, and would let\nhim to land in his own land; also it was told Sir Launcelot how that\nSir Mordred had laid siege about the Tower of London, because the queen\nwould not wed him; then was Sir Launcelot wroth out of measure, and said\nto his kinsmen: Alas, that double traitor Sir Mordred, now me repenteth\nthat ever he escaped my hands, for much shame hath he done unto my lord\nArthur; for all I feel by the doleful letter that my lord Sir Gawaine\nsent me, on whose soul Jesu have mercy that my lord Arthur is full hard\nbestead. Alas, said Sir Launcelot, that ever I should live to hear that\nmost noble king that made me knight thus to be overset with his subject\nin his own realm. And this doleful letter that my lord, Sir Gawaine,\nhath sent me afore his death, praying me to see his tomb, wit you well\nhis doleful words shall never go from mine heart, for he was a full\nnoble knight as ever was born; and in an unhappy hour was I born that\never I should have that unhap to slay first Sir Gawaine, Sir Gaheris\nthe good knight, and mine own friend Sir Gareth, that full noble knight.\nAlas, I may say I am unhappy, said Sir Launcelot, that ever I should\ndo thus unhappily, and, alas, yet might I never have hap to slay that\ntraitor, Sir Mordred.\n\nLeave your complaints, said Sir Bors, and first revenge you of the death\nof Sir Gawaine; and it will be well done that ye see Sir Gawaine's tomb,\nand secondly that ye revenge my lord Arthur, and my lady, Queen Guenever\nI thank you, said Sir Launcelot, for ever ye will my worship.\n\nThen they made them ready in all the haste that might be, with ships and\ngalleys, with Sir Launcelot and his host to pass into England. And so\nhe passed over the sea till he came to Dover, and there he landed with\nseven kings, and the number was hideous to behold. Then Sir Launcelot\nspered of men of Dover where was King Arthur become. Then the people\ntold him how that he was slain, and Sir Mordred and an hundred thousand\ndied on a day; and how Sir Mordred gave King Arthur there the first\nbattle at his landing, and there was good Sir Gawaine slain; and on the\nmorn Sir Mordred fought with the king upon Barham Down, and there the\nking put Sir Mordred to the worse. Alas, said Sir Launcelot, this is\nthe heaviest tidings that ever came to me. Now, fair sirs, said Sir\nLauncelot, shew me the tomb of Sir Gawaine. And then certain people of\nthe town brought him into the castle of Dover, and shewed him the tomb.\nThen Sir Launcelot kneeled down and wept, and prayed heartily for his\nsoul. And that night he made a dole, and all they that would come had\nas much flesh, fish, wine and ale, and every man and woman had twelve\npence, come who would. Thus with his own hand dealt he this money, in a\nmourning gown; and ever he wept, and prayed them to pray for the soul\nof Sir Gawaine. And on the morn all the priests and clerks that might\nbe gotten in the country were there, and sang mass of Requiem; and there\noffered first Sir Launcelot, and he offered an hundred pound; and\nthen the seven kings offered forty pound apiece; and also there was a\nthousand knights, and each of them offered a pound; and the offering\ndured from morn till night, and Sir Launcelot lay two nights on his tomb\nin prayers and weeping.\n\nThen on the third day Sir Launcelot called the kings, dukes, earls,\nbarons, and knights, and said thus: My fair lords, I thank you all of\nyour coming into this country with me, but we came too late, and that\nshall repent me while I live, but against death may no man rebel. But\nsithen it is so, said Sir Launcelot, I will myself ride and seek my\nlady, Queen Guenever, for as I hear say she hath had great pain and much\ndisease; and I heard say that she is fled into the west. Therefore ye\nall shall abide me here, and but if I come again within fifteen days,\nthen take your ships and your fellowship, and depart into your country,\nfor I will do as I say to you.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. How Sir Launcelot departed to seek the Queen Guenever, and\nhow he found her at Almesbury.\n\n\nTHEN came Sir Bors de Ganis, and said: My lord Sir Launcelot, what think\nye for to do, now to ride in this realm? wit ye well ye shall find few\nfriends. Be as be may, said Sir Launcelot, keep you still here, for I\nwill forth on my journey, and no man nor child shall go with me. So it\nwas no boot to strive, but he departed and rode westerly, and there he\nsought a seven or eight days; and at the last he came to a nunnery,\nand then was Queen Guenever ware of Sir Launcelot as he walked in the\ncloister. And when she saw him there she swooned thrice, that all the\nladies and gentlewomen had work enough to hold the queen up. So when\nshe might speak, she called ladies and gentlewomen to her, and said: Ye\nmarvel, fair ladies, why I make this fare. Truly, she said, it is for\nthe sight of yonder knight that yonder standeth; wherefore I pray you\nall call him to me.\n\nWhen Sir Launcelot was brought to her, then she said to all the ladies:\nThrough this man and me hath all this war been wrought, and the death of\nthe most noblest knights of the world; for through our love that we have\nloved together is my most noble lord slain. Therefore, Sir Launcelot,\nwit thou well I am set in such a plight to get my soul-heal; and yet\nI trust through God's grace that after my death to have a sight of the\nblessed face of Christ, and at domesday to sit on his right side, for as\nsinful as ever I was are saints in heaven. Therefore, Sir Launcelot, I\nrequire thee and beseech thee heartily, for all the love that ever was\nbetwixt us, that thou never see me more in the visage; and I command\nthee, on God's behalf, that thou forsake my company, and to thy kingdom\nthou turn again, and keep well thy realm from war and wrack; for as\nwell as I have loved thee, mine heart will not serve me to see thee,\nfor through thee and me is the flower of kings and knights destroyed;\ntherefore, Sir Launcelot, go to thy realm, and there take thee a wife,\nand live with her with joy and bliss; and I pray thee heartily, pray for\nme to our Lord that I may amend my misliving. Now, sweet madam, said Sir\nLauncelot, would ye that I should now return again unto my country, and\nthere to wed a lady? Nay, madam, wit you well that shall I never do, for\nI shall never be so false to you of that I have promised; but the same\ndestiny that ye have taken you to, I will take me unto, for to please\nJesu, and ever for you I cast me specially to pray. If thou wilt do so,\nsaid the queen, hold thy promise, but I may never believe but that thou\nwilt turn to the world again. Well, madam, said he, ye say as pleaseth\nyou, yet wist you me never false of my promise, and God defend but\nI should forsake the world as ye have done. For in the quest of the\nSangreal I had forsaken the vanities of the world had not your lord\nbeen. And if I had done so at that time, with my heart, will, and\nthought, I had passed all the knights that were in the Sangreal except\nSir Galahad, my son. And therefore, lady, sithen ye have taken you to\nperfection, I must needs take me to perfection, of right. For I take\nrecord of God, in you I have had mine earthly joy; and if I had found\nyou now so disposed, I had cast me to have had you into mine own realm.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. How Sir Launcelot came to the hermitage where the Archbishop\nof Canterbury was, and how he took the habit on him.\n\n\nBUT sithen I find you thus disposed, I ensure you faithfully, I will\never take me to penance, and pray while my life lasteth, if I may find\nany hermit, either gray or white, that will receive me. Wherefore,\nmadam, I pray you kiss me and never no more. Nay, said the queen, that\nshall I never do, but abstain you from such works: and they departed.\nBut there was never so hard an hearted man but he would have wept to see\nthe dolour that they made; for there was lamentation as they had been\nstung with spears; and many times they swooned, and the ladies bare the\nqueen to her chamber.\n\nAnd Sir Launcelot awoke, and went and took his horse, and rode all that\nday and all night in a forest, weeping. And at the last he was ware of\nan hermitage and a chapel stood betwixt two cliffs; and then he heard a\nlittle bell ring to mass, and thither he rode and alighted, and tied his\nhorse to the gate, and heard mass. And he that sang mass was the Bishop\nof Canterbury. Both the Bishop and Sir Bedivere knew Sir Launcelot, and\nthey spake together after mass. But when Sir Bedivere had told his\ntale all whole, Sir Launcelot's heart almost brast for sorrow, and Sir\nLauncelot threw his arms abroad, and said: Alas, who may trust this\nworld. And then he kneeled down on his knee, and prayed the Bishop to\nshrive him and assoil him. And then he besought the Bishop that he might\nbe his brother. Then the Bishop said: I will gladly; and there he put\nan habit upon Sir Launcelot, and there he served God day and night with\nprayers and fastings.\n\nThus the great host abode at Dover. And then Sir Lionel took fifteen\nlords with him, and rode to London to seek Sir Launcelot; and there Sir\nLionel was slain and many of his lords. Then Sir Bors de Ganis made the\ngreat host for to go home again; and Sir Bors, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir\nBlamore, Sir Bleoberis, with more other of Sir Launcelot's kin, took on\nthem to ride all England overthwart and endlong, to seek Sir Launcelot.\nSo Sir Bors by fortune rode so long till he came to the same chapel\nwhere Sir Launcelot was; and so Sir Bors heard a little bell knell, that\nrang to mass; and there he alighted and heard mass. And when mass was\ndone, the Bishop Sir Launcelot, and Sir Bedivere, came to Sir Bors. And\nwhen Sir Bors saw Sir Launcelot in that manner clothing, then he prayed\nthe Bishop that he might be in the same suit. And so there was an habit\nput upon him, and there he lived in prayers and fasting. And within\nhalf a year, there was come Sir Galihud, Sir Galihodin, Sir Blamore, Sir\nBleoberis, Sir Villiars, Sir Clarras, and Sir Gahalantine. So all these\nseven noble knights there abode still. And when they saw Sir Launcelot\nhad taken him to such perfection, they had no lust to depart, but took\nsuch an habit as he had.\n\nThus they endured in great penance six year; and then Sir Launcelot took\nthe habit of priesthood of the Bishop, and a twelvemonth he sang mass.\nAnd there was none of these other knights but they read in books, and\nholp for to sing mass, and rang bells, and did bodily all manner of\nservice. And so their horses went where they would, for they took no\nregard of no worldly riches. For when they saw Sir Launcelot endure such\npenance, in prayers, and fastings, they took no force what pain they\nendured, for to see the noblest knight of the world take such abstinence\nthat he waxed full lean. And thus upon a night, there came a vision to\nSir Launcelot, and charged him, in remission of his sins, to haste\nhim unto Almesbury: And by then thou come there, thou shalt find Queen\nGuenever dead. And therefore take thy fellows with thee, and purvey them\nof an horse bier, and fetch thou the corpse of her, and bury her by her\nhusband, the noble King Arthur. So this avision came to Sir Launcelot\nthrice in one night.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. How Sir Launcelot went with his seven fellows to Almesbury,\nand found there Queen Guenever dead, whom they brought to Glastonbury.\n\n\nTHEN Sir Launcelot rose up or day, and told the hermit. It were well\ndone, said the hermit, that ye made you ready, and that you disobey not\nthe avision. Then Sir Launcelot took his eight fellows with him, and on\nfoot they yede from Glastonbury to Almesbury, the which is little more\nthan thirty mile. And thither they came within two days, for they were\nweak and feeble to go. And when Sir Launcelot was come to Almesbury\nwithin the nunnery, Queen Guenever died but half an hour afore. And\nthe ladies told Sir Launcelot that Queen Guenever told them all or\nshe passed, that Sir Launcelot had been priest near a twelvemonth, And\nhither he cometh as fast as he may to fetch my corpse; and beside my\nlord, King Arthur, he shall bury me. Wherefore the queen said in hearing\nof them all: I beseech Almighty God that I may never have power to see\nSir Launcelot with my worldly eyen; and thus, said all the ladies, was\never her prayer these two days, till she was dead. Then Sir Launcelot\nsaw her visage, but he wept not greatly, but sighed. And so he did all\nthe observance of the service himself, both the dirige, and on the\nmorn he sang mass. And there was ordained an horse bier; and so with an\nhundred torches ever brenning about the corpse of the queen, and ever\nSir Launcelot with his eight fellows went about the horse bier, singing\nand reading many an holy orison, and frankincense upon the corpse\nincensed. Thus Sir Launcelot and his eight fellows went on foot from\nAlmesbury unto Glastonbury.\n\nAnd when they were come to the chapel and the hermitage, there she had\na dirige, with great devotion. And on the morn the hermit that sometime\nwas Bishop of Canterbury sang the mass of Requiem with great devotion.\nAnd Sir Launcelot was the first that offered, and then also his eight\nfellows. And then she was wrapped in cered cloth of Raines, from the top\nto the toe, in thirtyfold, and after she was put in a web of lead,\nand then in a coffin of marble. And when she was put in the earth Sir\nLauncelot swooned, and lay long still, while the hermit came and awaked\nhim, and said: Ye be to blame, for ye displease God with such manner\nof sorrow-making. Truly, said Sir Launcelot, I trust I do not displease\nGod, for He knoweth mine intent. For my sorrow was not, nor is not\nfor any rejoicing of sin, but my sorrow may never have end. For when I\nremember of her beauty, and of her noblesse, that was both with her king\nand with her, so when I saw his corpse and her corpse so lie together,\ntruly mine heart would not serve to sustain my careful body. Also when I\nremember me how by my default, mine orgule and my pride, that they were\nboth laid full low, that were peerless that ever was living of Christian\npeople, wit you well, said Sir Launcelot, this remembered, of their\nkindness and mine unkindness, sank so to mine heart, that I might not\nsustain myself. So the French book maketh mention.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. How Sir Launcelot began to sicken, and after died, whose\nbody was borne to Joyous Gard for to be buried.\n\n\nTHEN Sir Launcelot never after ate but little meat, ne drank, till he\nwas dead. For then he sickened more and more, and dried, and dwined\naway. For the Bishop nor none of his fellows might not make him to eat,\nand little he drank, that he was waxen by a cubit shorter than he was,\nthat the people could not know him. For evermore, day and night, he\nprayed, but sometime he slumbered a broken sleep; ever he was lying\ngrovelling on the tomb of King Arthur and Queen Guenever. And there was\nno comfort that the Bishop, nor Sir Bors, nor none of his fellows, could\nmake him, it availed not. So within six weeks after, Sir Launcelot fell\nsick, and lay in his bed; and then he sent for the Bishop that there was\nhermit, and all his true fellows. Then Sir Launcelot said with dreary\nsteven: Sir Bishop, I pray you give to me all my rites that longeth to\na Christian man. It shall not need you, said the hermit and all his\nfellows, it is but heaviness of your blood, ye shall be well mended by\nthe grace of God to-morn. My fair lords, said Sir Launcelot, wit you\nwell my careful body will into the earth, I have warning more than now\nI will say; therefore give me my rites. So when he was houseled and\nanealed, and had all that a Christian man ought to have, he prayed the\nBishop that his fellows might bear his body to Joyous Gard. Some men say\nit was Alnwick, and some men say it was Bamborough. Howbeit, said Sir\nLauncelot, me repenteth sore, but I made mine avow sometime, that in\nJoyous Gard I would be buried. And because of breaking of mine avow, I\npray you all, lead me thither. Then there was weeping and wringing of\nhands among his fellows.\n\nSo at a season of the night they all went to their beds, for they all\nlay in one chamber. And so after midnight, against day, the Bishop\n[that] then was hermit, as he lay in his bed asleep, he fell upon a\ngreat laughter. And therewith all the fellowship awoke, and came to the\nBishop, and asked him what he ailed. Ah Jesu mercy, said the Bishop,\nwhy did ye awake me? I was never in all my life so merry and so well\nat ease. Wherefore? said Sir Bors. Truly said the Bishop, here was Sir\nLauncelot with me with mo angels than ever I saw men in one day. And\nI saw the angels heave up Sir Launcelot unto heaven, and the gates of\nheaven opened against him. It is but dretching of swevens, said Sir\nBors, for I doubt not Sir Launcelot aileth nothing but good. It may\nwell be, said the Bishop; go ye to his bed, and then shall ye prove the\nsooth. So when Sir Bors and his fellows came to his bed they found him\nstark dead, and he lay as he had smiled, and the sweetest savour about\nhim that ever they felt.\n\nThen was there weeping and wringing of hands, and the greatest dole\nthey made that ever made men. And on the morn the Bishop did his mass\nof Requiem, and after, the Bishop and all the nine knights put Sir\nLauncelot in the same horse bier that Queen Guenever was laid in to-fore\nthat she was buried. And so the Bishop and they all together went with\nthe body of Sir Launcelot daily, till they came to Joyous Gard; and ever\nthey had an hundred torches brenning about him. And so within fifteen\ndays they came to Joyous Gard. And there they laid his corpse in the\nbody of the quire, and sang and read many psalters and prayers over him\nand about him.\n\nAnd ever his visage was laid open and naked, that all folks might behold\nhim. For such was the custom in those days, that all men of worship\nshould so lie with open visage till that they were buried. And right\nthus as they were at their service, there came Sir Ector de Maris, that\nhad seven years sought all England, Scotland, and Wales, seeking his\nbrother, Sir Launcelot.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. How Sir Ector found Sir Launcelot his brother dead, and\nhow Constantine reigned next after Arthur; and of the end of this book.\n\n\nAND when Sir Ector heard such noise and light in the quire of Joyous\nGard, he alighted and put his horse from him, and came into the quire,\nand there he saw men sing and weep. And all they knew Sir Ector, but he\nknew not them. Then went Sir Bors unto Sir Ector, and told him how\nthere lay his brother, Sir Launcelot, dead; and then Sir Ector threw\nhis shield, sword, and helm from him. And when he beheld Sir Launcelot's\nvisage, he fell down in a swoon. And when he waked it were hard any\ntongue to tell the doleful complaints that he made for his brother. Ah\nLauncelot, he said, thou were head of all Christian knights, and now\nI dare say, said Sir Ector, thou Sir Launcelot, there thou liest, that\nthou were never matched of earthly knight's hand. And thou were the\ncourteoust knight that ever bare shield. And thou were the truest friend\nto thy lover that ever bestrad horse. And thou were the truest lover of\na sinful man that ever loved woman. And thou were the kindest man that\never struck with sword. And thou were the goodliest person that ever\ncame among press of knights. And thou was the meekest man and the\ngentlest that ever ate in hall among ladies. And thou were the sternest\nknight to thy mortal foe that ever put spear in the rest. Then there was\nweeping and dolour out of measure.\n\nThus they kept Sir Launcelot's corpse aloft fifteen days, and then they\nburied it with great devotion. And then at leisure they went all with\nthe Bishop of Canterbury to his hermitage, and there they were together\nmore than a month. Then Sir Constantine, that was Sir Cador's son of\nCornwall, was chosen king of England. And he was a full noble knight,\nand worshipfully he ruled this realm. And then this King Constantine\nsent for the Bishop of Canterbury, for he heard say where he was. And\nso he was restored unto his Bishopric, and left that hermitage. And Sir\nBedivere was there ever still hermit to his life's end. Then Sir Bors de\nGanis, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir Gahalantine, Sir Galihud, Sir Galihodin,\nSir Blamore, Sir Bleoberis, Sir Villiars le Valiant, Sir Clarrus of\nClermont, all these knights drew them to their countries. Howbeit King\nConstantine would have had them with him, but they would not abide in\nthis realm. And there they all lived in their countries as holy men.\nAnd some English books make mention that they went never out of England\nafter the death of Sir Launcelot, but that was but favour of makers. For\nthe French book maketh mention, and is authorised, that Sir Bors, Sir\nEctor, Sir Blamore, and Sir Bleoberis, went into the Holy Land thereas\nJesu Christ was quick and dead, and anon as they had stablished their\nlands. For the book saith, so Sir Launcelot commanded them for to do,\nor ever he passed out of this world. And these four knights did many\nbattles upon the miscreants or Turks. And there they died upon a Good\nFriday for God's sake.\n\n_Here is the end of the book of King Arthur, and of his noble knights\nof the Round Table, that when they were whole together there was ever\nan hundred and forty. And here is the end of the death of Arthur. I pray\nyou all, gentlemen and gentlewomen that readeth this book of Arthur and\nhis knights, from the beginning to the ending, pray for me while I am\nalive, that God send me good deliverance, and when I am dead, I pray\nyou all pray for my soul. For this book was ended the ninth year of the\nreign of King Edward the Fourth, by Sir Thomas Maleore, knight, as Jesu\nhelp him for his great might, as he is the servant of Jesu both day and\nnight._\n\n_Thus endeth this noble and joyous book entitled Le Morte Darthur.\nNotwithstanding it treateth of the birth, life, and acts of the said\nKing Arthur, of his noble knights of the Round Table, their marvellous\nenquests and adventures, the achieving of the Sangreal, and in the end\nthe dolorous death and departing out of this world of them all. Which\nbook was reduced into English by Sir Thomas Malory, knight, as afore is\nsaid, and by me divided into twenty-one books, chaptered and emprinted,\nand finished in the abbey, Westminster, the last day of July the year of\nour Lord MCCCCLXXX{?}._\n\n_Caxton me fieri fecit._\n\n\n\n\nGLOSSARY\n\n\n     Abashed, abased, lowered,\n     Abate, depress, calm,\n     Abought, paid for,\n     Abraid, started,\n     Accompted, counted,\n     Accorded, agreed,\n     Accordment, agreement,\n     Acquit, repay,\n     Actually, actively,\n     Adoubted, afraid,\n     Advision, vision,\n     Afeard, afraid,\n     Afterdeal, disadvantage,\n     Againsay, retract,\n     Aknown, known,\n     Aligement, alleviation,\n     Allegeance, alleviation,\n     Allow, approve,\n     Almeries, chests,\n     Alther, gen. pl., of all,\n     Amounted, mounted,\n     Anealed, anointed,\n     Anguishly, in pain,\n     Anon, at once,\n     Apair, weaken,\n     Apparelled, fitted up,\n     Appeach, impeach,\n     Appealed, challenged, accused,\n     Appertices, displays,\n     Araged, enraged, ;

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
