OF BURGSTEAD AND ITS FOLK AND ITS NEIGHBOURS\n\n\n\nOnce upon a time amidst the mountains and hills and falling streams\nof a fair land there was a town or thorp in a certain valley.  This\nwas well-nigh encompassed by a wall of sheer cliffs; toward the East\nand the great mountains they drew together till they went near to\nmeet, and left but a narrow path on either side of a stony stream\nthat came rattling down into the Dale:  toward the river at that end\nthe hills lowered somewhat, though they still ended in sheer rocks;\nbut up from it, and more especially on the north side, they swelled\ninto great shoulders of land, then dipped a little, and rose again\ninto the sides of huge fells clad with pine-woods, and cleft here and\nthere by deep ghylls:  thence again they rose higher and steeper, and\never higher till they drew dark and naked out of the woods to meet\nthe snow-fields and ice-rivers of the high mountains.  But that was\nfar away from the pass by the little river into the valley; and the\nsaid river was no drain from the snow-fields white and thick with the\ngrinding of the ice, but clear and bright were its waters that came\nfrom wells amidst the bare rocky heaths.\n\nThe upper end of the valley, where it first began to open out from\nthe pass, was rugged and broken by rocks and ridges of water-borne\nstones, but presently it smoothed itself into mere grassy swellings\nand knolls, and at last into a fair and fertile plain swelling up\ninto a green wave, as it were, against the rock-wall which\nencompassed it on all sides save where the river came gushing out of\nthe strait pass at the east end, and where at the west end it poured\nitself out of the Dale toward the lowlands and the plain of the great\nriver.\n\nNow the valley was some ten miles of our measure from that place of\nthe rocks and the stone-ridges, to where the faces of the hills drew\nsomewhat anigh to the river again at the west, and then fell aback\nalong the edge of the great plain; like as when ye fare a-sailing\npast two nesses of a river-mouth, and the main-sea lieth open before\nyou.\n\nBesides the river afore-mentioned, which men called the Weltering\nWater, there were other waters in the Dale.  Near the eastern pass,\nentangled in the rocky ground was a deep tarn full of cold springs\nand about two acres in measure, and therefrom ran a stream which fell\ninto the Weltering Water amidst the grassy knolls.  Black seemed the\nwaters of that tarn which on one side washed the rocks-wall of the\nDale; ugly and aweful it seemed to men, and none knew what lay\nbeneath its waters save black mis-shapen trouts that few cared to\nbring to net or angle:  and it was called the Death-Tarn.\n\nOther waters yet there were:  here and there from the hills on both\nsides, but especially from the south side, came trickles of water\nthat ran in pretty brooks down to the river; and some of these sprang\nbubbling up amidst the foot-mounds of the sheer-rocks; some had cleft\na rugged and strait way through them, and came tumbling down into the\nDale at diverse heights from their faces.  But on the north side\nabout halfway down the Dale, one stream somewhat bigger than the\nothers, and dealing with softer ground, had cleft for itself a wider\nway; and the folk had laboured this way wider yet, till they had made\nthem a road running north along the west side of the stream.  Sooth\nto say, except for the strait pass along the river at the eastern\nend, and the wider pass at the western, they had no other way (save\none of which a word anon) out of the Dale but such as mountain goats\nand bold cragsmen might take; and even of these but few.\n\nThis midway stream was called the Wildlake, and the way along it\nWildlake's Way, because it came to them out of the wood, which on\nthat north side stretched away from nigh to the lip of the valley-\nwall up to the pine woods and the high fells on the east and north,\nand down to the plain country on the west and south.\n\nNow when the Weltering Water came out of the rocky tangle near the\npass, it was turned aside by the ground till it swung right up to the\nfeet of the Southern crags; then it turned and slowly bent round\nagain northward, and at last fairly doubled back on itself before it\nturned again to run westward; so that when, after its second double,\nit had come to flowing softly westward under the northern crags, it\nhad cast two thirds of a girdle round about a space of land a little\nbelow the grassy knolls and tofts aforesaid; and there in that fair\nspace between the folds of the Weltering Water stood the Thorp\nwhereof the tale hath told.\n\nThe men thereof had widened and deepened the Weltering Water about\nthem, and had bridged it over to the plain meads; and athwart the\nthroat of the space left clear by the water they had built them a\nstrong wall though not very high, with a gate amidst and a tower on\neither side thereof.  Moreover, on the face of the cliff which was\nbut a stone's throw from the gate they had made them stairs and\nladders to go up by; and on a knoll nigh the brow had built a watch-\ntower of stone strong and great, lest war should come into the land\nfrom over the hills.  That tower was ancient, and therefrom the Thorp\nhad its name and the whole valley also; and it was called Burgstead\nin Burgdale.\n\nSo long as the Weltering Water ran straight along by the northern\ncliffs after it had left Burgstead, betwixt the water and the cliffs\nwas a wide flat way fashioned by man's hand.  Thus was the water\nagain a good defence to the Thorp, for it ran slow and deep there,\nand there was no other ground betwixt it and the cliffs save that\nroad, which was easy to bar across so that no foemen might pass\nwithout battle, and this road was called the Portway.  For a long\nmile the river ran under the northern cliffs, and then turned into\nthe midst of the Dale, and went its way westward a broad stream\nwinding in gentle laps and folds here and there down to the out-gate\nof the Dale.  But the Portway held on still underneath the rock-wall,\ntill the sheer-rocks grew somewhat broken, and were cumbered with\ncertain screes, and at last the wayfarer came upon the break in them,\nand the ghyll through which ran the Wildlake with Wildlake's Way\nbeside it, but the Portway still went on all down the Dale and away\nto the Plain-country.\n\nThat road in the ghyll, which was neither wide nor smooth, the\nwayfarer into the wood must follow, till it lifted itself out of the\nghyll, and left the Wildlake coming rattling down by many steps from\nthe east; and now the way went straight north through the woodland,\never mounting higher, (because the whole set of the land was toward\nthe high fells,) but not in any cleft or ghyll.  The wood itself\nthereabout was thick, a blended growth of diverse kinds of trees, but\nmost of oak and ash; light and air enough came through their boughs\nto suffer the holly and bramble and eglantine and other small wood to\ngrow together into thickets, which no man could pass without hewing a\nway.  But before it is told whereto Wildlake's Way led, it must be\nsaid that on the east side of the ghyll, where it first began just\nover the Portway, the hill's brow was clear of wood for a certain\nspace, and there, overlooking all the Dale, was the Mote-stead of the\nDalesmen, marked out by a great ring of stones, amidst of which was\nthe mound for the Judges and the Altar of the Gods before it.  And\nthis was the holy place of the men of the Dale and of other folk\nwhereof the tale shall now tell.\n\nFor when Wildlake's Way had gone some three miles from the Mote-\nstead, the trees began to thin, and presently afterwards was a\nclearing and the dwellings of men, built of timber as may well be\nthought.  These houses were neither rich nor great, nor was the folk\na mighty folk, because they were but a few, albeit body by body they\nwere stout carles enough.  They had not affinity with the Dalesmen,\nand did not wed with them, yet it is to be deemed that they were\nsomewhat akin to them.  To be short, though they were freemen, yet as\nregards the Dalesmen were they well-nigh their servants; for they\nwere but poor in goods, and had to lean upon them somewhat.  No\ntillage they had among those high trees; and of beasts nought save\nsome flocks of goats and a few asses.  Hunters they were, and\ncharcoal-burners, and therein the deftest of men, and they could\nshoot well in the bow withal:  so they trucked their charcoal and\ntheir smoked venison and their peltries with the Dalesmen for wheat\nand wine and weapons and weed; and the Dalesmen gave them main good\npennyworths, as men who had abundance wherewith to uphold their\nkinsmen, though they were but far-away kin.  Stout hands had these\nWoodlanders and true hearts as any; but they were few-spoken and to\nthose that needed them not somewhat surly of speech and grim of\nvisage:  brown-skinned they were, but light-haired; well-eyed, with\nbut little red in their cheeks:  their women were not very fair, for\nthey toiled like the men, or more.  They were thought to be wiser\nthan most men in foreseeing things to come.  They were much given to\nspells, and songs of wizardry, and were very mindful of the old\nstory-lays, wherein they were far more wordy than in their daily\nspeech.  Much skill had they in runes, and were exceeding deft in\nscoring them on treen bowls, and on staves, and door-posts and roof-\nbeams and standing-beds and such like things.  Many a day when the\nsnow was drifting over their roofs, and hanging heavy on the tree-\nboughs, and the wind was roaring through the trees aloft and rattling\nabout the close thicket, when the boughs were clattering in the wind,\nand crashing down beneath the weight of the gathering freezing snow,\nwhen all beasts and men lay close in their lairs, would they sit long\nhours about the house-fire with the knife or the gouge in hand, with\nthe timber twixt their knees and the whetstone beside them,\nhearkening to some tale of old times and the days when their banner\nwas abroad in the world; and they the while wheedling into growth out\nof the tough wood knots and blossoms and leaves and the images of\nbeasts and warriors and women.\n\nThey were called nought save the Woodland-Carles in that day, though\ntime had been when they had borne a nobler name:  and their abode was\ncalled Carlstead.  Shortly, for all they had and all they had not,\nfor all they were and all they were not, they were well-beloved by\ntheir friends and feared by their foes.\n\nNow when Wildlake's Way was gotten to Carlstead, there was an end of\nit toward the north; though beyond it in a right line the wood was\nthinner, because of the hewing of the Carles.  But the road itself\nturned west at once and went on through the wood, till some four\nmiles further it first thinned and then ceased altogether, the ground\ngoing down-hill all the way:  for this was the lower flank of the\nfirst great upheaval toward the high mountains.  But presently, after\nthe wood was ended, the land broke into swelling downs and winding\ndales of no great height or depth, with a few scattered trees about\nthe hillsides, mostly thorns or scrubby oaks, gnarled and bent and\nkept down by the western wind:  here and there also were yew-trees,\nand whiles the hillsides would be grown over with box-wood, but none\nvery great; and often juniper grew abundantly.  This then was the\ncountry of the Shepherds, who were friends both of the Dalesmen and\nthe Woodlanders.  They dwelt not in any fenced town or thorp, but\ntheir homesteads were scattered about as was handy for water and\nshelter.  Nevertheless they had their own stronghold; for amidmost of\ntheir country, on the highest of a certain down above a bottom where\na willowy stream winded, was a great earthwork:  the walls thereof\nwere high and clean and overlapping at the entering in, and amidst of\nit was a deep well of water, so that it was a very defensible place:\nand thereto would they drive their flocks and herds when war was in\nthe land, for nought but a very great host might win it; and this\nstronghold they called Greenbury.\n\nThese Shepherd-Folk were strong and tall like the Woodlanders, for\nthey were partly of the same blood, but burnt they were both ruddy\nand brown:  they were of more words than the Woodlanders but yet not\nmany-worded.  They knew well all those old story-lays, (and this\npartly by the minstrelsy of the Woodlanders,) but they had scant\nskill in wizardry, and would send for the Woodlanders, both men and\nwomen, to do whatso they needed therein.  They were very hale and\nlong-lived, whereas they dwelt in clear bright air, and they mostly\nwent light-clad even in the winter, so strong and merry were they.\nThey wedded with the Woodlanders and the Dalesmen both; at least\ncertain houses of them did so.  They grew no corn; nought but a few\npot-herbs, but had their meal of the Dalesmen; and in the summer they\ndrave some of their milch-kine into the Dale for the abundance of\ngrass there; whereas their own hills and bents and winding valleys\nwere not plenteously watered, except here and there as in the bottom\nunder Greenbury.  No swine they had, and but few horses, but of sheep\nvery many, and of the best both for their flesh and their wool.  Yet\nwere they nought so deft craftsmen at the loom as were the Dalesmen,\nand their women were not very eager at the weaving, though they\nloathed not the spindle and rock.  Shortly, they were merry folk\nwell-beloved of the Dalesmen, quick to wrath, though it abode not\nlong with them; not very curious in their houses and halls, which\nwere but little, and were decked mostly with the handiwork of the\nWoodland-Carles their guests; who when they were abiding with them,\nwould oft stand long hours nose to beam, scoring and nicking and\nhammering, answering no word spoken to them but with aye or no,\ndesiring nought save the endurance of the daylight.  Moreover, this\nshepherd-folk heeded not gay raiment over-much, but commonly went\nclad in white woollen or sheep-brown weed.\n\nBut beyond this shepherd-folk were more downs and more, scantily\npeopled, and that after a while by folk with whom they had no kinship\nor affinity, and who were at whiles their foes.  Yet was there no\nenduring enmity between them; and ever after war and battle came\npeace; and all blood-wites were duly paid and no long feud followed:\nnor were the Dalesmen and the Woodlanders always in these wars,\nthough at whiles they were.  Thus then it fared with these people.\n\nBut now that we have told of the folks with whom the Dalesmen had\nkinship, affinity, and friendship, tell we of their chief abode,\nBurgstead to wit, and of its fashion.  As hath been told, it lay upon\nthe land made nigh into an isle by the folds of the Weltering Water\ntowards the uppermost end of the Dale; and it was warded by the deep\nwater, and by the wall aforesaid with its towers.  Now the Dale at\nits widest, to wit where Wildlake fell into it, was but nine furlongs\nover, but at Burgstead it was far narrower; so that betwixt the wall\nand the wandering stream there was but a space of fifty acres, and\ntherein lay Burgstead in a space of the shape of a sword-pommel:  and\nthe houses of the kinships lay about it, amidst of gardens and\norchards, but little ordered into streets and lanes, save that a way\nwent clean through everything from the tower-warded gate to the\nbridge over the Water, which was warded by two other towers on its\nhither side.\n\nAs to the houses, they were some bigger, some smaller, as the\nhousemates needed.  Some were old, but not very old, save two only,\nand some quite new, but of these there were not many:  they were all\nbuilt fairly of stone and lime, with much fair and curious carved\nwork of knots and beasts and men round about the doors; or whiles a\nwale of such-like work all along the house-front.  For as deft as\nwere the Woodlanders with knife and gouge on the oaken beams, even so\ndeft were the Dalesmen with mallet and chisel on the face of the hewn\nstone; and this was a great pastime about the Thorp.  Within these\nhouses had but a hall and solar, with shut-beds out from the hall on\none side or two, with whatso of kitchen and buttery and out-bower men\ndeemed handy.  Many men dwelt in each house, either kinsfolk, or such\nas were joined to the kindred.\n\nNear to the gate of Burgstead in that street aforesaid and facing\neast was the biggest house of the Thorp; it was one of the two\nabovesaid which were older than any other.  Its door-posts and the\nlintel of the door were carved with knots and twining stems fairer\nthan other houses of that stead; and on the wall beside the door\ncarved over many stones was an image wrought in the likeness of a man\nwith a wide face, which was terrible to behold, although it smiled:\nhe bore a bent bow in his hand with an arrow fitted to its string,\nand about the head of him was a ring of rays like the beams of the\nsun, and at his feet was a dragon, which had crept, as it were, from\namidst of the blossomed knots of the door-post wherewith the tail of\nhim was yet entwined.  And this head with the ring of rays about it\nwas wrought into the adornment of that house, both within and\nwithout, in many other places, but on never another house of the\nDale; and it was called the House of the Face.  Thereof hath the tale\nmuch to tell hereafter, but as now it goeth on to tell of the ways of\nlife of the Dalesmen.\n\nIn Burgstead was no Mote-hall or Town-house or Church, such as we wot\nof in these days; and their market-place was wheresoever any might\nchoose to pitch a booth:  but for the most part this was done in the\nwide street betwixt the gate and the bridge.  As to a meeting-place,\nwere there any small matters between man and man, these would the\nAlderman or one of the Wardens deal with, sitting in Court with the\nneighbours on the wide space just outside the Gate:  but if it were\nto do with greater matters, such as great manslayings and blood-\nwites, or the making of war or ending of it, or the choosing of the\nAlderman and the Wardens, such matters must be put off to the Folk-\nmote, which could but be held in the place aforesaid where was the\nDoom-ring and the Altar of the Gods; and at that Folk-mote both the\nShepherd-Folk and the Woodland-Carles foregathered with the Dalesmen,\nand duly said their say.  There also they held their great casts and\nmade offerings to the Gods for the Fruitfulness of the Year, the\ningathering of the increase, and in Memory of their Forefathers.\nNatheless at Yule-tide also they feasted from house to house to be\nglad with the rest of Midwinter, and many a cup drank at those feasts\nto the memory of the fathers, and the days when the world was wider\nto them, and their banners fared far afield.\n\nBut besides these dwellings of men in the field between the wall and\nthe water, there were homesteads up and down the Dale whereso men\nfound it easy and pleasant to dwell:  their halls were built of much\nthe same fashion as those within the Thorp; but many had a high\ngarth-wall cast about them, so that they might make a stout defence\nin their own houses if war came into the Dale.\n\nAs to their work afield; in many places the Dale was fair with growth\nof trees, and especially were there long groves of sweet chestnut\nstanding on the grass, of the fruit whereof the folk had much gain.\nAlso on the south side nigh to the western end was a wood or two of\nyew-trees very great and old, whence they gat them bow-staves, for\nthe Dalesmen also shot well in the bow.  Much wheat and rye they\nraised in the Dale, and especially at the nether end thereof.  Apples\nand pears and cherries and plums they had in plenty; of which trees,\nsome grew about the borders of the acres, some in the gardens of the\nThorp and the homesteads.  On the slopes that had grown from the\nbreaking down here and there of the Northern cliffs, and which faced\nthe South and the Sun's burning, were rows of goodly vines, whereof\nthe folk made them enough and to spare of strong wine both white and\nred.\n\nAs to their beasts; swine they had a many, but not many sheep, since\nherein they trusted to their trucking with their friends the\nShepherds; they had horses, and yet but a few, for they were stout in\ngoing afoot; and, had they a journey to make with women big with\nbabes, or with children or outworn elders, they would yoke their oxen\nto their wains, and go fair and softly whither they would.  But the\nsaid oxen and all their neat were exceeding big and fair, far other\nthan the little beasts of the Shepherd-Folk; they were either dun of\ncolour, or white with black horns (and those very great) and black\ntail-tufts and ear-tips.  Asses they had, and mules for the paths of\nthe mountains to the east; geese and hens enough, and dogs not a few,\ngreat hounds stronger than wolves, sharp-nosed, long-jawed, dun of\ncolour, shag-haired.\n\nAs to their wares; they were very deft weavers of wool and flax, and\nmade a shift to dye the thrums in fair colours; since both woad and\nmadder came to them good cheap by means of the merchants of the plain\ncountry, and of greening weeds was abundance at hand.  Good smiths\nthey were in all the metals:  they washed somewhat of gold out of the\nsands of the Weltering Water, and copper and tin they fetched from\nthe rocks of the eastern mountains; but of silver they saw little,\nand iron they must buy of the merchants of the plain, who came to\nthem twice in the year, to wit in the spring and the late autumn just\nbefore the snows.  Their wares they bought with wool spun and in the\nfleece, and fine cloth, and skins of wine and young neat both steers\nand heifers, and wrought copper bowls, and gold and copper by weight,\nfor they had no stamped money.  And they guested these merchants\nwell, for they loved them, because of the tales they told them of the\nPlain and its cities, and the manslayings therein, and the fall of\nKings and Dukes, and the uprising of Captains.\n\nThus then lived this folk in much plenty and ease of life, though not\ndelicately nor desiring things out of measure.  They wrought with\ntheir hands and wearied themselves; and they rested from their toil\nand feasted and were merry:  to-morrow was not a burden to them, nor\nyesterday a thing which they would fain forget:  life shamed them\nnot, nor did death make them afraid.\n\nAs for the Dale wherein they dwelt, it was indeed most fair and\nlovely, and they deemed it the Blessing of the Earth, and they trod\nits flowery grass beside its rippled streams amidst its green tree-\nboughs proudly and joyfully with goodly bodies and merry hearts.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.  OF FACE-OF-GOD AND HIS KINDRED\n\n\n\nTells the tale, that on an evening of late autumn when the weather\nwas fair, calm, and sunny, there came a man out of the wood hard by\nthe Mote-stead aforesaid, who sat him down at the roots of the\nSpeech-mound, casting down before him a roe-buck which he had just\nslain in the wood.  He was a young man of three and twenty summers;\nhe was so clad that he had on him a sheep-brown kirtle and leggings\nof like stuff bound about with white leather thongs; he bore a short-\nsword in his girdle and a little axe withal; the sword with fair\nwrought gilded hilts and a dew-shoe of like fashion to its sheath.\nHe had his quiver at his back and bare in his hand his bow unstrung.\nHe was tall and strong, very fair of fashion both of limbs and face,\nwhite-skinned, but for the sun's tanning, and ruddy-cheeked:  his\nbeard was little and fine, his hair yellow and curling, cut somewhat\nclose, but for its length so plenteous, and so thick, that none could\nfail to note it.  He had no hat nor hood upon his head, nought but a\nfillet of golden beads.\n\nAs he sat down he glanced at the dale below him with a well-pleased\nlook, and then cast his eyes down to the grass at his feet, as though\nto hold a little longer all unchanged the image of the fair place he\nhad just seen.  The sun was low in the heavens, and his slant beams\nfell yellow all up the dale, gilding the chestnut groves grown dusk\nand grey with autumn, and the black masses of the elm-boughs, and\ngleaming back here and there from the pools of the Weltering Water.\nDown in the midmost meadows the long-horned dun kine were moving\nslowly as they fed along the edges of the stream, and a dog was\nbounding about with exceeding swiftness here and there among them.\nAt a sharply curved bight of the river the man could see a little\nvermilion flame flickering about, and above it a thin blue veil of\nsmoke hanging in the air, and clinging to the boughs of the willows\nanear; about it were a dozen menfolk clear to see, some sitting, some\nstanding, some walking to and fro, but all in company together:  four\nof were brown-clad and short-skirted like himself, and from above the\nhand of one came a flash of light as the sun smote upon the steel of\nhis spear.  The others were long-skirted and clad gayer, and amongst\nthem were red and blue and green and white garments, and they were\nclear to be seen for women.  Just as the young man looked up again,\nthose of them who were sitting down rose up, and those that were\nstrolling drew nigh, and they joined hands together, and fell to\ndancing on the grass, and the dog and another one with him came up to\nthe dancers and raced about and betwixt them; and so clear to see\nwere they all and so little, being far away, that they looked like\ndainty well-wrought puppets.\n\nThe young man sat smiling at it for a little, and then rose up and\nshouldered his venison, and went down into Wildlake's Way, and\npresently was fairly in the Dale and striding along the Portway\nbeside the northern cliffs, whose greyness was gilded yet by the last\nrays of the sun, though in a minute or two it would go under the\nwestern rim.  He went fast and cheerily, murmuring to himself\nsnatches of old songs; none overtook him on the road, but he overtook\ndivers folk going alone or in company toward Burgstead; swains and\nold men, mothers and maidens coming from the field and the acre, or\ngoing from house to house; and one or two he met but not many.  All\nthese greeted him kindly, and he them again; but he stayed not to\nspeak with any, but went as one in haste.\n\nIt was dusk by then he passed under the gate of Burgstead; he went\nstraight thence to the door of the House of the Face, and entered as\none who is at home, and need go no further, nor abide a bidding.\n\nThe hall he came into straight out of the open air was long and\nsomewhat narrow and not right high; it was well-nigh dark now within,\nbut since he knew where to look, he could see by the flicker that\nleapt up now and then from the smouldering brands of the hearth\namidmost the hall under the luffer, that there were but three men\ntherein, and belike they were even they whom he looked to find there,\nand for their part they looked for his coming, and knew his step.\n\nHe set down his venison on the floor, and cried out in a cheery\nvoice:  'Ho, Kettel!  Are all men gone without doors to sleep so near\nthe winter-tide, that the Hall is as dark as a cave?  Hither to me!\nOr art thou also sleeping?'\n\nA voice came from the further side of the hearth:  'Yea, lord, asleep\nI am, and have been, and dreaming; and in my dream I dealt with the\nflesh-pots and the cake-board, and thou shalt see my dream come true\npresently to thy gain.'\n\nQuoth another voice:  'Kettel hath had out that share of his dream\nalready belike, if the saw sayeth sooth about cooks.  All ye have\nbeen away, so belike he hath done as Rafe's dog when Rafe ran away\nfrom the slain buck.'\n\nHe laughed therewith, and Kettel with him, and a third voice joined\nthe laughter.  The young man also laughed and said:  'Here I bring\nthe venison which my kinsman desired; but as ye see I have brought it\nover-late:  but take it, Kettel.  When cometh my father from the\nstithy?'\n\nQuoth Kettel:  'My lord hath been hard at it shaping the Yule-tide\nsword, and doth not lightly leave such work, as ye wot, but he will\nbe here presently, for he has sent to bid us dight for supper\nstraightway.'\n\nSaid the young man:  'Where are there lords in the dale, Kettel, or\nhast thou made some thyself, that thou must be always throwing them\nin my teeth?'\n\n'Son of the Alderman,' said Kettel, 'ye call me Kettel, which is no\nname of mine, so why should I not call thee lord, which is no dignity\nof thine, since it goes well over my tongue from old use and wont?\nBut here comes my mate of the kettle, and the women and lads.  Sit\ndown by the hearth away from their hurry, and I will fetch thee the\nhand-water.'\n\nThe young man sat down, and Kettel took up the venison and went his\nways toward the door at the lower end of the hall; but ere he reached\nit it opened, and a noisy crowd entered of men, women, boys, and\ndogs, some bearing great wax candles, some bowls and cups and dishes\nand trenchers, and some the boards for the meal.\n\nThe young man sat quiet smiling and winking his eyes at the sudden\nflood of light let into the dark place; he took in without looking at\nthis or the other thing the aspect of his Fathers' House, so long\nfamiliar to him; yet to-night he had a pleasure in it above his wont,\nand in all the stir of the household; for the thought of the wood\nwherein he had wandered all day yet hung heavy upon him.  Came one of\nthe girls and cast fresh brands on the smouldering fire and stirred\nit into a blaze, and the wax candles were set up on the dais, so that\nbetween them and the mew-quickened fire every corner of the hall was\nbright.  As aforesaid it was long and narrow, over-arched with stone\nand not right high, the windows high up under the springing of the\nroof-arch and all on the side toward the street; over against them\nwere the arches of the shut-beds of the housemates.  The walls were\nbare that evening, but folk were wont to hang up hallings of woven\npictures thereon when feasts and high-days were toward; and all along\nthe walls were the tenter-hooks for that purpose, and divers weapons\nand tools were hanging from them here and there.  About the dais\nbehind the thwart-table were now stuck for adornment leavy boughs of\noak now just beginning to turn with the first frosts.  High up on the\ngable wall above the tenter-hooks for the hangings were carven fair\nimagery and knots and twining stems; for there in the hewn atone was\nset forth that same image with the rayed head that was on the outside\nwall, and he was smiting the dragon and slaying him; but here inside\nthe house all this was stained in fair and lively colours, and the\nsun-like rays round the head of the image were of beaten gold.  At\nthe lower end of the hall were two doors going into the butteries,\nand kitchen, and other out-bowers; and above these doors was a loft\nupborne by stone pillars, which loft was the sleeping chamber of the\ngoodman of the house; but the outward door was halfway between the\nsaid loft and the hearth of the hall.\n\nSo the young man took the shoes from his feet and then sat watching\nthe women and lads arraying the boards, till Kettel came again to him\nwith an old woman bearing the ewer and basin, who washed his feet and\npoured the water over his hands, and gave him the towel with fair-\nbroidered ends to dry them withal.\n\nScarce had he made an end of this ere through the outer door came in\nthree men and a young woman with them; the foremost of these was a\nman younger by some two years than the first-comer, but so like him\nthat none might misdoubt that he was his brother; the next was an old\nman with a long white beard, but hale and upright; and lastly came a\nman of middle-age, who led the young woman by the hand.  He was\ntaller than the first of the young men, though the other who entered\nwith him outwent him in height; a stark carle he was, broad across\nthe shoulders, thin in the flank, long-armed and big-handed; very\nnoble and well-fashioned of countenance, with a straight nose and\ngrey eyes underneath a broad brow:  his hair grown somewhat scanty\nwas done about with a fillet of golden beads like the young men his\nsons.  For indeed this was their father, and the master of the House.\n\nHis name was Iron-face, for he was the deftest of weapon-smiths, and\nhe was the Alderman of the Dalesmen, and well-beloved of them; his\nkindred was deemed the noblest of the Dale, and long had they dwelt\nin the House of the Face.  But of his sons the youngest, the new-\ncomer, was named Hall-face, and his brother the elder Face-of-god;\nwhich name was of old use amongst the kindred, and many great men and\nstout warriors had borne it aforetime:  and this young man, in great\nlove had he been gotten, and in much hope had he been reared, and\ntherefore had he been named after the best of the kindred.  But his\nmother, who was hight the Jewel, and had been a very fair woman, was\ndead now, and Iron-face lacked a wife.\n\nFace-of-god was well-beloved of his kindred and of all the Folk of\nthe Dale, and he had gotten a to-name, and was called Gold-mane\nbecause of the abundance and fairness of his hair.\n\nAs for the young woman that was led in by Iron-face, she was the\nbetrothed of Face-of-god, and her name was the Bride.  She looked\nwith such eyes of love on him when she saw him in the hall, as though\nshe had never seen him before but once, nor loved him but since\nyesterday; though in truth they had grown up together and had seen\neach other most days of the year for many years.  She was of the\nkindred with whom the chiefs and great men of the Face mostly wedded,\nwhich was indeed far away kindred of them.  She was a fair woman and\nstrong:  not easily daunted amidst perils she was hardy and handy and\nlight-foot:  she could swim as well as any, and could shoot well in\nthe bow, and wield sword and spear:  yet was she kind and\ncompassionate, and of great courtesy, and the very dogs and kine\ntrusted in her and loved her.  Her hair was dark red of hue, long and\nfine and plenteous, her eyes great and brown, her brow broad and very\nfair, her lips fine and red:  her cheek not ruddy, yet nowise sallow,\nbut clear and bright:  tall she was and of excellent fashion, but\nwell-knit and well-measured rather than slender and wavering as the\nwillow-bough.  Her voice was sweet and soft, her words few, but\nexceeding dear to the listener.  In short, she was a woman born to be\nthe ransom of her Folk.\n\nNow as to the names which the menfolk of the Face bore, and they an\nancient kindred, a kindred of chieftains, it has been said that in\ntimes past their image of the God of the Earth had over his treen\nface a mask of beaten gold fashioned to the shape of the image; and\nthat when the Alderman of the Folk died, he to wit who served the God\nand bore on his arm the gold-ring between the people and the altar,\nthis visor or face of God was laid over the face of him who had been\nin a manner his priest, and therewith he was borne to mound; and the\nnew Alderman and priest had it in charge to fashion a new visor for\nthe God; and whereas for long this great kindred had been chieftains\nof the people, they had been, and were all so named, that the word\nFace was ever a part of their names.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.  THEY TALK OF DIVERS MATTERS IN THE HALL\n\n\n\nNow Face-of-god, who is also called Gold-mane, rose up to meet the\nnew-comers, and each of them greeted him kindly, and the Bride kissed\nhim on the cheek, and he her in likewise; and he looked kindly on\nher, and took her hand, and went on up the hall to the dais,\nfollowing his father and the old man; as for him, he was of the\nkindred of the House, and was foster-father of Iron-face and of his\nsons both; and his name was Stone-face:  a stark warrior had he been\nwhen he was young, and even now he could do a man's work in the\nbattlefield, and his understanding was as good as that of a man in\nhis prime.  So went these and four others up on to the dais and sat\ndown before the thwart-table looking down the hall, for the meat was\nnow on the board; and of the others there were some fifty men and\nwomen who were deemed to be of the kindred and sat at the endlong\ntables.\n\nSo then the Alderman stood up and made the sign of the Hammer over\nthe meat, the token of his craft and of his God.  Then they fell to\nwith good hearts, for there was enough and to spare of meat and\ndrink.  There was bread and flesh (though not Gold-mane's venison),\nand leeks and roasted chestnuts of the grove, and red-cheeked apples\nof the garth, and honey enough of that year's gathering, and medlars\nsharp and mellow:  moreover, good wine of the western bents went up\nand down the hall in great gilded copper bowls and in mazers girt and\nlipped with gold.\n\nBut when they were full of meat, and had drunken somewhat, they fell\nto speech, and Iron-face spake aloud to his son, who had but been\nspeaking softly to the Bride as one playmate to the other:  but the\nAlderman said:  'Scarce are the wood-deer grown, kinsman, when I must\nneeds eat sheep's flesh on a Thursday, though my son has lain abroad\nin the woods all night to hunt for me.'\n\nAnd therewith he smiled in the young man's face; but Gold-mane\nreddened and said:  'So is it, kinsman, I can hit what I can see; but\nnot what is hidden.'\n\nIron-face laughed and said:  'Hast thou been to the Woodland-Carles?\nare their women fairer than our cousins?'\n\nFace-of-god took up the Bride's hand in his and kissed it and laid it\nto his cheek; and then turned to his father and said:  'Nay, father,\nI saw not the Wood-carles, nor went to their abode; and on no day do\nI lust after their women.  Moreover, I brought home a roebuck of the\nfattest; but I was over-late for Kettel, and the flesh was ready for\nthe board by then I came.'\n\n'Well, son,' quoth Iron-face, for he was merry, 'a roebuck is but a\nlittle deer for such big men as are thou and I.  But I rede thee take\nthe Bride along with thee the next time; and she shall seek whilest\nthou sleepest, and hit when thou missest.'\n\nThen Face-of-god smiled, but he frowned somewhat also, and he said:\n'Well were that, indeed!  But if ye must needs drag a true tale out\nof me:  that roebuck I shot at the very edge of the wood nigh to the\nMote-stead as I was coming home:  harts had I seen in the wood and\nits lawns, and boars, and bucks, and loosed not at them:  for indeed\nwhen I awoke in the morning in that wood-lawn ye wot of, I wandered\nup and down with my bow unbent.  So it was that I fared as if I were\nseeking something, I know not what, that should fill up something\nlacking to me, I know not what.  Thus I felt in myself even so long\nas I was underneath the black boughs, and there was none beside me\nand before me, and none to turn aback to:  but when I came out again\ninto the sunshine, and I saw the fair dale, and the happy abode lying\nbefore me, and folk abroad in the meads merry in the eventide; then\nwas I full fain of it, and loathed the wood as an empty thing that\nhad nought to give me; and lo you! all that I had been longing for in\nthe wood, was it not in this House and ready to my hand?--and that is\ngood meseemeth.'\n\nTherewith he drank of the cup which the Bride put into his hand after\nshe had kissed the rim, but when he had set it down again he spake\nonce more:\n\n'And yet now I am sitting honoured and well-beloved in the House of\nmy Fathers, with the holy hearth sparkling and gleaming down there\nbefore me; and she that shall bear my children sitting soft and kind\nby my side, and the bold lads I shall one day lead in battle drinking\nout of my very cup:  now it seems to me that amidst all this, the\ndark cold wood, wherein abide but the beasts and the Foes of the\nGods, is bidding me to it and drawing me thither.  Narrow is the Dale\nand the World is wide; I would it were dawn and daylight, that I\nmight be afoot again.'\n\nAnd he half rose up from his place.  But his father bent his brow on\nhim and said:  'Kinsman, thou hast a long tongue for a half-trained\nwhelp:  nor see I whitherward thy mind is wandering, but if it be on\nthe road of a lad's desire to go further and fare worse.  Hearken\nthen, I will offer thee somewhat!  Soon shall the West-country\nmerchants be here with their winter truck.  How sayest thou? hast\nthou a mind to fare back with them, and look on the Plain and its\nCities, and take and give with the strangers?  To whom indeed thou\nshalt be nothing save a purse with a few lumps of gold in it, or\nmaybe a spear in the stranger's band on the stricken field, or a bow\non the wall of an alien city.  This is a craft which thou mayst well\nlearn, since thou shalt be a chieftain; a craft good to learn,\nhowever grievous it be in the learning.  And I myself have been\nthere; for in my youth I desired sore to look on the world beyond the\nmountains; so I went, and I filled my belly with the fruit of my own\ndesires, and a bitter meat was that; but now that it has passed\nthrough me, and I yet alive, belike I am more of a grown man for\nhaving endured its gripe.  Even so may it well be with thee, son; so\ngo if thou wilt; and thou shalt go with my blessing, and with gold\nand wares and wain and spearmen.'\n\n'Nay,' said Face-of-god, 'I thank thee, for it is well offered; but I\nwill not go, for I have no lust for the Plain and its Cities; I love\nthe Dale well, and all that is round about it; therein will I live\nand die.'\n\nTherewith he fell a-musing; and the Bride looked at him anxiously,\nbut spake not.  Sooth to say her heart was sinking, as though she\nforeboded some new thing, which should thrust itself into their merry\nlife.\n\nBut the old man Stone-face took up the word and said:\n\n'Son Gold-mane, it behoveth me to speak, since belike I know the\nwild-wood better than most, and have done for these three-score and\nten years; to my cost.  Now I perceive that thou longest for the wood\nand the innermost of it; and wot ye what?  This longing will at\nwhiles entangle the sons of our chieftains, though this Alderman that\nnow is hath been free therefrom, which is well for him.  For, time\nwas this longing came over me, and I went whither it led me:\noverlong it were to tell of all that befell me because of it, and how\nmy heart bled thereby.  So sorry were the tidings that came of it,\nthat now meseemeth my heart should be of stone and not my face, had\nit not been for the love wherewith I have loved the sons of the\nkindred.  Therefore, son, it were not ill if ye went west away with\nthe merchants this winter, and learned the dealings of the cities,\nand brought us back tales thereof.'\n\nBut Gold-mane cried out somewhat angrily, 'I tell thee, foster-\nfather, that I have no mind for the cities and their men and their\nfools and their whores and their runagates.  But as for the wood and\nits wonders, I have done with it, save for hunting there along with\nothers of the Folk.  So let thy mind be at ease; and for the rest, I\nwill do what the Alderman commandeth, and whatso my father craveth of\nme.'\n\n'And that is well, son,' said Stone-face, 'if what ye say come to\npass, as sore I misdoubt me it will not.  But well it were, well it\nwere!  For such things are in the wood, yea and before ye come to its\ninnermost, as may well try the stoutest heart.  Therein are Kobbolds,\nand Wights that love not men, things unto whom the grief of men is as\nthe sound of the fiddle-bow unto us.  And there abide the ghosts of\nthose that may not rest; and there wander the dwarfs and the\nmountain-dwellers, the dealers in marvels, the givers of gifts that\ndestroy Houses; the forgers of the curse that clingeth and the murder\nthat flitteth to and fro.  There moreover are the lairs of Wights in\nthe shapes of women, that draw a young man's heart out of his body,\nand fill up the empty place with desire never to be satisfied, that\nthey may mock him therewith and waste his manhood and destroy him.\nNor say I much of the strong-thieves that dwell there, since thou art\na valiant sword; or of them who have been made Wolves of the Holy\nPlaces; or of the Murder-Carles, the remnants and off-scourings of\nwicked and wretched Folks--men who think as much of the life of a man\nas of the life of a fly.  Yet happiest is the man whom they shall\ntear in pieces, than he who shall live burdened by the curse of the\nFoes of the Gods.'\n\nThe housemaster looked on his son as the old carle spake, and a cloud\ngathered on his face a while; and when Stone-face had made an end he\nspake:\n\n'This is long and evil talk for the end of a merry day, O fosterer!\nWilt thou not drink a draught, O Redesman, and then stand up and set\nthy fiddle-bow a-dancing, and cause it draw some fair words after it?\nFor my cousin's face hath grown sadder than a young maid's should be,\nand my son's eyes gleam with thoughts that are far away from us and\nabroad in the wild-wood seeking marvels.'\n\nThen arose a man of middle-age from the top of the endlong bench on\nthe east side of the hall:  a man tall, thin and scant-haired, with a\nnose like an eagle's neb:  he reached out his hand for the bowl, and\nwhen they had given to him he handled it, and raised it aloft and\ncried:\n\n'Here I drink a double health to Face-of-god and the Bride, and the\nlove that lieth between them, and the love betwixt them twain and\nus.'\n\nHe drank therewith, and the wine went up and down the hall, and all\nmen drank, both carles and queens, with shouting and great joy.  Then\nRedesman put down the cup (for it had come into his hands again), and\nreached his hand to the wall behind him, and took down his fiddle\nhanging there in its case, and drew it out and fell to tuning it,\nwhile the hall grew silent to hearken:  then he handled the bow and\nlaid it on the strings till they wailed and chuckled sweetly, and\nwhen the song was well awake and stirring briskly, then he lifted up\nhis voice and sang:\n\n\nThe Minstrel saith:\n\n'O why on this morning, ye maids, are ye tripping\n   Aloof from the meadows yet fresh with the dew,\nWhere under the west wind the river is lipping\n   The fragrance of mint, the white blooms and the blue?\n\nFor rough is the Portway where panting ye wander;\n   On your feet and your gown-hems the dust lieth dun;\nCome trip through the grass and the meadow-sweet yonder,\n   And forget neath the willows the sword of the sun.\n\nThe Maidens answer:\n\nThough fair are the moon-daisies down by the river,\n   And soft is the grass and the white clover sweet;\nThough twixt us and the rock-wall the hot glare doth quiver,\n   And the dust of the wheel-way is dun on our feet;\n\nYet here on the way shall we walk on this morning\n   Though the sun burneth here, and sweet, cool is the mead;\nFor here when in old days the Burg gave its warning,\n   Stood stark under weapons the doughty of deed.\n\nHere came on the aliens their proud words a-crying,\n   And here on our threshold they stumbled and fell;\nHere silent at even the steel-clad were lying,\n   And here were our mothers the story to tell.\n\nHere then on the morn of the eve of the wedding\n   We pray to the Mighty that we too may bear\nSuch war-walls for warding of orchard and steading,\n   That the new days be merry as old days were dear.'\n\n\nTherewith he made an end, and shouts and glad cries arose all about\nthe hall; and an old man arose and cried:  'A cup to the memory of\nthe Mighty of the Day of the Warding of the Ways.'  For you must know\nthis song told of a custom of the Folk, held in memory of a time of\nbygone battle, wherein they had overthrown a great host of aliens on\nthe Portway betwixt the river and the cliffs, two furlongs from the\ngate of Burgstead.  So now two weeks before Midsummer those maidens\nwho were presently to be wedded went early in the morning to that\nplace clad in very fair raiment, swords girt to their sides and\nspears in their hands, and abode there on the highway from morn till\neven as though they were a guard to it.  And they made merry there,\nsinging songs and telling tales of times past:  and at the sunsetting\ntheir grooms came to fetch them away to the Feast of the Eve of the\nWedding.\n\nWhile the song was a-singing Face-of-god took the Bride's hand in his\nand caressed it, and was soft and blithe with her; and she reddened\nand trembled for pleasure, and called to mind wedding feasts that had\nbeen, and fair brides that she had seen thereat, and she forgot her\nfears and her heart was at peace again.\n\nAnd Iron-face looked well-pleased on the two from time to time, and\nsmiled, but forbore words to them.\n\nBut up and down the hall men talked with one another about things\nlong ago betid:  for their hearts were high and they desired deeds;\nbut in that fair Dale so happy were the years from day to day that\nthere was but little to tell of.  So deepened the night and waned,\nand Gold-mane and the Bride still talked sweetly together, and at\nwhiles kindly to the others; and by seeming he had clean forgotten\nthe wood and its wonders.\n\nThen at last the Alderman called for the cup of good-night, and men\ndrank thereof and went their ways to bed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.  FACE-OF-GOD FARETH TO THE WOOD AGAIN\n\n\n\nWhen it was the earliest morning and dawn was but just beginning,\nFace-of-god awoke and rose up from his bed, and came forth into the\nhall naked in his shirt, and stood by the hearth, wherein the piled-\nup embers were yet red, and looked about and could see nothing\nstirring in the dimness:  then he fetched water and washed the night-\ntide off him, and clad himself in haste, and was even as he was\nyesterday, save that he left his bow and quiver in their place and\ntook instead a short casting-spear; moreover he took a leathern scrip\nand went therewith to the buttery, and set therein bread and flesh\nand a little gilded beaker; and all this he did with but little\nnoise; for he would not be questioned, lest he should have to answer\nhimself as well as others.\n\nThus he went quietly out of doors, for the door was but latched,\nsince no bolts or bars or locks were used in Burgstead, and through\nthe town-gate, which stood open, save when rumours of war were about.\nHe turned his face straight towards Wildlake's Way, walking briskly,\nbut at whiles looking back over his shoulder toward the East to note\nwhat way was made by the dawning, and how the sky lightened above the\nmountain passes.\n\nBy then he was come to the place where the Maiden Ward was held in\nthe summer the dawn was so far forward that all things had their due\ncolours, and were clear to see in the shadowless day.  It was a\nbright morning, with an easterly air stirring that drave away the\nhaze and dried the meadows, which had otherwise been rimy; for it was\ncold.  Gold-mane lingered on the place a little, and his eyes fell on\nthe road, as dusty yet as in Redesman's song; for the autumn had been\nvery dry, and the strip of green that edged the outside of the way\nwas worn and dusty also.  On the edge of it, half in the dusty road,\nhalf on the worn grass, was a long twine of briony red-berried and\nblack-leaved; and right in the midst of the road were two twigs of\ngreat-leaved sturdy pollard oak, as though they had been thrown aside\nthere yesterday by women or children a-sporting; and the deep white\ndust yet held the marks of feet, some bare, some shod, crossing each\nother here and there.  Face-of-god smiled as he passed on, as a man\nwith a happy thought; for his mind showed him a picture of the Bride\nas she would be leading the Maiden Ward next summer, and singing\nfirst among the singers, and he saw her as clearly as he had often\nseen her verily, and before him was the fashion of her hands and all\nher body, and the little mark on her right wrist, and the place where\nher arm whitened, because the sleeve guarded it against the sun,\nwhich had long been pleasant unto him, and the little hollow in her\nchin, and the lock of red-brown hair waving in the wind above her\nbrow, and shining in the sun as brightly as the Alderman's cunningest\nwork of golden wire.  Soft and sweet seemed that picture, till he\nalmost seemed to hear her sweet voice calling to him, and desire of\nher so took hold of the youth, that it stirred him up to go swiftlier\nas he strode on, the day brightening behind him.\n\nNow was it nigh sunrise, and he began to meet folk on the way, though\nnot many; since for most their way lay afield, and not towards the\nBurg.  The first was a Woodlander, tall and gaunt, striding beside\nhis ass, whose panniers were laden with charcoal.  The carle's\ndaughter, a little maiden of seven winters, riding on the ass's back\nbetwixt the panniers, and prattling to herself in the cold morning;\nfor she was pleased with the clear light in the east, and the smooth\nwide turf of the meadows, as one who had not often been far from the\nshadow of the heavy trees of the wood, and their dark wall round\nabout the clearing where they dwelt.  Face-of-god gave the twain the\nsele of the day in merry fashion as he passed them by, and the sober\ndark-faced man nodded to him but spake no word, and the child stayed\nher prattle to watch him as he went by.\n\nThen came the sound of the rattle of wheels, and, as he doubled an\nangle of the rock-wall, he came upon a wain drawn by four dun kine,\nwherein lay a young woman all muffled up against the cold with furs\nand cloths; beside the yoke-beasts went her man, a well-knit trim-\nfaced Dalesman clad bravely in holiday raiment, girt with a goodly\nsword, bearing a bright steel helm on his head, in his hand a long\nspear with a gay red and white shaft done about with copper bands.\nHe looked merry and proud of his wain-load, and the woman was smiling\nkindly on him from out of her scarlet and fur; but now she turned a\nweary happy face on Gold-mane, for they knew him, as did all men of\nthe Dale.\n\nSo he stopped when they met, for the goodman had already stayed his\nslow beasts, and the goodwife had risen a little on her cushions to\ngreet him, yet slowly and but a little, for she was great with child,\nand not far from her time.  That knew Gold-mane well, and what was\ntoward, and why the goodman wore his fine clothes, and why the wain\nwas decked with oak-boughs and the yoke-beasts with their best gilded\nbells and copper-adorned harness.  For it was a custom with many of\nthe kindreds that the goodwife should fare to her father's house to\nlie in with her first babe, and the day of her coming home was made a\ngreat feast in the house.  So then Face-of-god cried out:  'Hail to\nthee, O Warcliff!  Shrewd is the wind this morning, and thou dost\nwell to heed it carefully, this thine orchard, this thy garden, this\nthy fair apple-tree!  To a good hall thou wendest, and the Wine of\nIncrease shall be sweet there this even.'\n\nThen smiled Warcliff all across his face, and the goodwife hung her\nhead and reddened.  Said the goodman:  'Wilt thou not be with us, son\nof the Alderman, as surely thy father shall be?'\n\n'Nay,' said Face-of-god, 'though I were fain of it:  my own matters\ncarry me away.'\n\n'What matters?' said Warcliff; 'perchance thou art for the cities\nthis autumn?'\n\nFace-of-god answered somewhat stiffly:  'Nay, I am not;' and then\nmore kindly, and smiling, 'All roads lead not down to the Plain,\nfriend.'\n\n'What road then farest thou away from us?' said the goodwife.\n\n'The way of my will,' he answered.\n\n'And what way is that?' said she; 'take heed, lest I get a longing to\nknow.  For then must thou needs tell me, or deal with the carle there\nbeside thee.'\n\n'Nay, goodwife,' said Face-of-god, 'let not that longing take thee;\nfor on that matter I am even as wise as thou.  Now good speed to thee\nand to the new-comer!'\n\nTherewith he went close up to the wain, and reached out his hand to\nher, and she gave him hers and he kissed it, and so went his ways\nsmiling kindly on them.  Then the carle cried to his kine, and they\nbent down their heads to the yoke; and presently, as he walked on, he\nheard the rumble of the wain mingling with the tinkling of their\nbells, which in a little while became measured and musical, and\nsounded above the creaking of the axles and the rattle of the gear\nand the roll of the great wheels over the road:  and so it grew\nthinner and thinner till it all died away behind him.\n\nHe was now come to where the river turned away from the sheer rock-\nwall, which was not so high there as in most other places, as there\nhad been in old time long screes from the cliff, which had now grown\ntogether, with the waxing of herbs and the washing down of the earth\non to them, and made a steady slope or low hill going down riverward.\nOver this the road lifted itself above the level of the meadows,\nkeeping a little way from the cliffs, while on the other side its\nbank was somewhat broken and steep here and there.  As Face-of-god\ncame up to one of these broken places, the sun rose over the eastern\npass, and the meadows grew golden with its long beams.  He lingered,\nand looked back under his hand, and as he did so heard the voices and\nlaughter of women coming up from the slope below him, and presently a\nyoung woman came struggling up the broken bank with hand and knee,\nand cast herself down on the roadside turf laughing and panting.  She\nwas a long-limbed light-made woman, dark-faced and black-haired:\namidst her laughter she looked up and saw Gold-mane, who had stopped\nat once when he saw her; she held out her hands to him, and said\nlightly, though her face flushed withal:\n\n'Come hither, thou, and help the others to climb the bank; for they\nare beaten in the race, and now must they do after my will; that was\nthe forfeit.'\n\nHe went up to her, and took her hands and kissed them, as was the\ncustom of the Dale, and said:\n\n'Hail to thee, Long-coat! who be they, and whither away this morning\nearly?'\n\nShe looked hard at him, and fondly belike, as she answered slowly:\n'They be the two maidens of my father's house, whom thou knowest; and\nour errand, all three of us, is to Burgstead, the Feast of the Wine\nof Increase which shall be drunk this even.'\n\nAs she spake came another woman half up the bank, to whom went Face-\nof-god, and, taking her hands, drew her up while she laughed merrily\nin his face:  he saluted her as he had Long-coat, and then with a\nlaugh turned about to wait for the third; who came indeed, but after\na little while, for she had abided, hearing their voices.  Her also\nGold-mane drew up, and kissed her hands, and she lay on the grass by\nLong-coat, but the second maiden stood up beside the young man.  She\nwas white-skinned and golden-haired, a very fair damsel, whereas the\nlast-comer was but comely, as were well-nigh all the women of the\nDale.\n\nSaid Face-of-god, looking on the three:  'How comes it, maidens, that\nye are but in your kirtles this sharp autumn morning? or where have\nye left your gowns or your cloaks?'\n\nFor indeed they were clad but in close-fitting blue kirtles of fine\nwool, embroidered about the hems with gold and coloured threads.\n\nThe last-comer laughed and said:  'What ails thee, Gold-mane, to be\nso careful of us, as if thou wert our mother or our nurse?  Yet if\nthou must needs know, there hang our gowns on the thorn-bush down\nyonder; for we have been running a match and a forfeit; to wit, that\nshe who was last on the highway should go down again and bring them\nup all three; and now that is my day's work:  but since thou art\nhere, Alderman's son, thou shalt go down instead of me and fetch them\nup.'\n\nBut he laughed merrily and outright, and said:  'That will I not, for\nthere be but twenty-four hours in the day, and what between eating\nand drinking and talking to fair maidens, I have enough to do in\nevery one of them.  Wasteful are ye women, and simple is your\nforfeit.  Now will I, who am the Alderman's son, give forth a doom,\nand will ordain that one of you fetch up the gowns yourselves, and\nthat Long-coat be the one; for she is the fleetest-footed and ablest\nthereto.  Will ye take my doom? for later on I shall not be wiser.'\n\n'Yea,' said the fair woman, 'not because thou art the Alderman's son,\nbut because thou art the fairest man of the Dale, and mayst bid us\npoor souls what thou wilt.'\n\nFace-of-god reddened at her words, and the speaker and the last-comer\nlaughed; but Long-coat held her peace:  she cast one very sober look\non him, and then ran lightly down the bent; he drew near the edge of\nit, and watched her going; for her light-foot slimness was fair to\nlook on:  and he noted that when she was nigh the thorn-bush whereon\nhung the bright-broidered gowns, and deemed belike that she was not\nseen, she kissed both her hands where he had kissed them erst.\n\nThereat he drew aback and turned away shyly, scarce looking at the\nother twain, who smiled on him with somewhat jeering looks; but he\nbade them farewell and departed speedily; and if they spoke, it was\nbut softly, for he heard their voices no more.\n\nHe went on under the sunlight which was now gilding the outstanding\nstones of the cliffs, and still his mind was set upon the Bride; and\nhis meeting with the mother of the yet unborn baby, and with the\nthree women with their freshness and fairness, did somehow turn his\nthought the more upon her, since she was the woman who was to be his\namongst all women, for she was far fairer than any one of them; and\nthrough all manner of life and through all kinds of deeds would he be\nwith her, and know more of her fairness and kindness than any other\ncould:  and him-seemed he could see pictures of her and of him amidst\nall these deeds and ways.\n\nNow he went very swiftly; for he was eager, though he knew not for\nwhat, and he thought but little of the things on which his eyes fell.\nHe met none else on the road till he was come to Wildlake's Way,\nthough he saw folk enough down in the meadows; he was soon amidst the\nfirst of the trees, and without making any stay set his face east and\nsomewhat north, that is, toward the slopes that led to the great\nmountains.  He said to himself aloud, as he wended the wood:\n'Strange! yestereven I thought much of the wood, and I set my mind on\nnot going thither, and this morning I thought nothing of it, and here\nam I amidst its trees, and wending towards its innermost.'\n\nHis way was easy at first, because the wood for a little space was\nall of beech, so that there was no undergrowth, and he went lightly\nbetwixt the tall grey and smooth boles; albeit his heart was nought\nso gay as it was in the dale amidst the sunshine.  After a while the\nbeech-wood grew thinner, and at last gave out altogether, and he came\ninto a space of rough broken ground with nought but a few scrubby\noaks and thorn-bushes growing thereon here and there.  The sun was\nhigh in the heavens now, and shone brightly down on the waste, though\nthere were a few white clouds high up above him.  The rabbits\nscuttled out of the grass before him; here and there he turned aside\nfrom a stone on which lay coiled an adder sunning itself; now and\nagain both hart and hind bounded away from before him, or a sounder\nof wild swine ran grunting away toward closer covert.  But nought did\nhe see but the common sights and sounds of the woodland; nor did he\nlook for aught else, for he knew this part of the woodland\nindifferent well.\n\nHe held on over this treeless waste for an hour or more, when the\nground began to be less rugged, and he came upon trees again, but\nthinly scattered, oak and ash and hornbeam not right great, with\nthickets of holly and blackthorn between them.  The set of the ground\nwas still steadily up to the east and north-east, and he followed it\nas one who wendeth an assured way.  At last before him seemed to rise\na wall of trees and thicket; but when he drew near to it, lo! an\nopening in a certain place, and a little path as if men were wont to\nthread the tangle of the wood thereby; though hitherto he had noted\nno slot of men, nor any sign of them, since he had plunged into the\ndeep of the beech-wood.  He took the path as one who needs must, and\nwent his ways as it led.  In sooth it was well-nigh blind, but he was\na deft woodsman, and by means of it skirted many a close thicket that\nhad otherwise stayed him.  So on he went, and though the boughs were\nclose enough overhead, and the sun came through but in flecks, he\njudged that it was growing towards noon, and he wotted well that he\nwas growing aweary.  For he had been long afoot, and the more part of\nthe time on a rough way, or breasting a slope which was at whiles\nsteep enough.\n\nAt last the track led him skirting about an exceeding close thicket\ninto a small clearing, through which ran a little woodland rill\namidst rushes and dead leaves:  there was a low mound near the\neastern side of this wood-lawn, as though there had been once a\ndwelling of man there, but no other sign or slot of man was there.\n\nSo Face-of-god made stay in that place, casting himself down beside\nthe rill to rest him and eat and drink somewhat.  Whatever thoughts\nhad been with him through the wood (and they been many) concerning\nhis House and his name, and his father, and the journey he might make\nto the cities of the Westland, and what was to befall him when he was\nwedded, and what war or trouble should be on his hands--all this was\nnow mingled together and confused by this rest amidst his weariness.\nHe laid down his scrip, and drew his meat from it and ate what he\nwould, and dipping his gilded beaker into the brook, drank water\nsmacking of the damp musty savour of the woodland; and then his head\nsank back on a little mound in the short turf, and he fell asleep at\nonce.  A long dream he had in short space; and therein were blent his\nthoughts of the morning with the deeds of yesterday; and other\nmatters long forgotten in his waking hours came back to his slumber\nin unordered confusion:  all which made up for him pictures clear,\nbut of little meaning, save that, as oft befalls in dreams, whatever\nhe was a-doing he felt himself belated.\n\nWhen he awoke, smiling at something strange in his gone-by dream, he\nlooked up to the heavens, thinking to see signs of the even at hand,\nfor he seemed to have been dreaming so long.  The sky was thinly\novercast by now, but by his wonted woodcraft he knew the whereabouts\nof the sun, and that it was scant an hour after noon.  He sat there\ntill he was wholly awake, and then drank once more of the woodland\nwater; and he said to himself, but out loud, for he was fain of the\nsound of a man's voice, though it were but his own:\n\n'What is mine errand hither?  Whither wend I?  What shall I have done\nto-morrow that I have hitherto left undone?  Or what manner of man\nshall I be then other than I am now?'\n\nYet though he said the words he failed to think the thought, or it\nleft him in a moment of time, and he thought but of the Bride and her\nkindness.  Yet that abode with him but a moment, and again he saw\nhimself and those two women on the highway edge, and Long-coat\nlingering on the slope below, kissing his kisses on her hands; and he\nwas sorry that she desired him over-much, for she was a fair woman\nand a friendly.  But all that also flowed from him at once, and he\nhad no thought in him but that he also desired something that he\nlacked:  and this was a burden to him, and he rose up frowning, and\nsaid to himself, 'Am I become a mere sport of dreams, whether I sleep\nor wake?  I will go backward--or forward, but will think no more.'\n\nThen he ordered his gear again, and took the path onward and upward\ntoward the Great Mountains; and the track was even fainter than\nbefore for a while, so that he had to seek his way diligently.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.  FACE-OF-GOD FALLS IN WITH MENFOLK ON THE MOUNTAIN\n\n\n\nNow he plodded on steadily, and for a long time the forest changed\nbut little, and of wild things he saw only a few of those that love\nthe closest covert.  The ground still went up and up, though at\nwhiles were hollows, and steeper bents out of them again, and the\nhalf-blind path or slot still led past the close thickets and fallen\ntrees, and he made way without let or hindrance.  At last once more\nthe wood began to thin, and the trees themselves to be smaller and\ngnarled and ill-grown:  therewithal the day was waning, and the sky\nwas quite clear again as the afternoon grew into a fair autumn\nevening.\n\nNow the trees failed altogether, and the slope grown steeper was\ncovered with heather and ling; and looking up, he saw before him\nquite near by seeming in the clear even (though indeed they were yet\nfar away) the snowy peaks flushed with the sinking sun against the\nfrosty dark-grey eastern sky; and below them the dark rock-mountains,\nand below these again, and nigh to him indeed, the fells covered with\npine-woods and looking like a wall to the heaths he trod.\n\nHe stayed a little while and turned his head to look at the way\nwhereby he had come; but that way a swell of the oak-forest hid\neverything but the wood itself, making a wall behind him as the pine-\nwood made a wall before.  There came across him then a sharp memory\nof the boding words which Stone-face had spoken last night, and he\nfelt as if he were now indeed within the trap.  But presently he\nlaughed and said:  'I am a fool:  this comes of being alone in the\ndark wood and the dismal waste, after the merry faces of the Dale had\nswept away my foolish musings of yesterday and the day before.  Lo!\nhere I stand, a man of the Face, sword and axe by my side; if death\ncome, it can but come once; and if I fear not death, what shall make\nme afraid?  The Gods hate me not, and will not hurt me; and they are\nnot ugly, but beauteous.'\n\nTherewith he strode on again, and soon came to a place where the\nground sank into a shallow valley and the ling gave place to grass\nfor a while, and there were tall old pines scattered about, and\nbetwixt them grey rocks; this he passed through, climbing a steep\nbent out of it, and the pines were all about him now, though growing\nwide apart, till at last he came to where they thickened into a wood,\nnot very close, wherethrough he went merrily, singing to himself and\nswinging his spear.  He was soon through this wood, and came on to a\nwide well-grassed wood-lawn, hedged by the wood aforesaid on three\nsides, but sloping up slowly toward the black wall of the thicker\npine-wood on the fourth side, and about half a furlong overthwart and\nendlong.  The sun had set while he was in the last wood, but it was\nstill broad daylight on the wood-lawn, and as he stood there he was\nware of a house under the pine-wood on the other side, built long and\nlow, much like the houses of the Woodland-Carles, but rougher\nfashioned and of unhewn trees.  He gazed on it, and said aloud to\nhimself as his wont was:\n\n'Marvellous! here is a dwelling of man, scarce a day's journey from\nBurgstead; yet have I never heard tell of it:  may happen some of the\nWoodland-Carles have built it, and are on some errand of hunting\npeltries up in the mountains, or maybe are seeking copper and tin\namong the rocks.  Well, at least let us go see what manner of men\ndwell there, and if they are minded for a guest to-night; for fain\nwere I of a bed beneath a roof, and of a board with strong meat and\ndrink on it.'\n\nTherewith he set forward, not heeding much that the wood he had\npassed through was hard on his left hand; but he had gone but twenty\npaces when he saw a red thing at the edge of the wood, and then a\nglitter, and a spear came whistling forth, and smote his own spear so\nhard close to the steel that it flew out of his hand; then came a\ngreat shout, and a man clad in a scarlet kirtle ran forth on him.\nFace-of-god had his axe in his hand in a twinkling, and ran at once\nto meet his foe; but the man had the hill on his side as he rushed on\nwith a short-sword in his hand.  Axe and sword clashed together for a\nmoment of time, and then both the men rolled over on the grass\ntogether, and Face-of-god as he fell deemed that he heard the shrill\ncry of a woman.  Now Face-of-god found that he was the nethermost,\nfor if he was strong, yet was his foe stronger; the axe had flown out\nof his hand also, while the strange man still kept a hold of his\nshort-sword; and presently, though he still struggled all he could,\nhe saw the man draw back his hand to smite with the said sword; and\nat that nick of time the foeman's knee was on his breast, his left\nhand was doubled back behind him, and his right wrist was gripped\nhard in the stranger's left hand.  Even therewith his ears, sharpened\nby the coming death, heard the sound of footsteps and fluttering\nraiment drawing near; something dark came between him and the sky;\nthere was the sound of a great stroke, and the big man loosened his\ngrip and fell off him to one side.\n\nFace-of-god leapt up and ran to his axe and got hold of it; but\nturning round found himself face to face with a tall woman holding in\nher hand a stout staff like the limb of a tree.  She was calm and\nsmiling, though forsooth it was she who had stricken the stroke and\nstayed the sword from his throat.  His hand and axe dropped down to\nhis side when he saw what it was that faced him, and that the woman\nwas young and fair; so he spake to her and said:\n\n'What aileth, maiden? is this man thy foe? doth he oppress thee?\nshall I slay him?'\n\nShe laughed and said:  'Thou art open-handed in thy proffers:  he\nmight have asked the like concerning thee but a minute ago.'\n\n'Yea, yea,' said Gold-mane, laughing also, 'but he asked it not of\nthee.'\n\n'That is sooth,' she said, 'but since thou hast asked me, I will tell\nthee that if thou slay him it will be my harm as well as his; and in\nmy country a man that taketh a gift is not wont to break the giver's\nhead with it straightway.  The man is my brother, O stranger, and\npresently, if thou wilt, thou mayst be eating at the same board with\nhim.  Or if thou wilt, thou mayst go thy ways unhurt into the wood.\nBut I had liefer of the twain that thou wert in our house to-night;\nfor thou hast a wrong against us.'\n\nHer voice was sweet and clear, and she spake the last words kindly,\nand drew somewhat nigher to Gold-mane.  Therewithal the smitten man\nsat up, and put his hand to his head, and quoth he:\n\n'Angry is my sister! good it is to wear the helm abroad when she\nshaketh the nut-trees.'\n\n' Nay,' said she, 'it is thy luck that thou wert bare-headed, else\nhad I been forced to smite thee on the face.  Thou churl, since when\nhath it been our wont to thrust knives into a guest, who is come of\ngreat kin, a man of gentle heart and fair face?  Come hither and\nhandsel him self-doom for thy fool's onset!'\n\nThe man rose to his feet and said:  'Well, sister, least said,\nsoonest mended.  A clout on the head is worse than a woman's chiding;\nbut since ye have given me one, ye may forbear the other.'\n\nTherewith he drew near to them.  He was a very big-made man, most\nstalwarth, with dark red hair and a thin pointed beard; his nose was\nstraight and fine, his eyes grey and well-opened, but somewhat fierce\nwithal.  Yet was he in nowise evil-looking; he seemed some thirty\nsummers old.  He was clad in a short scarlet kirtle, a goodly\ngarment, with a hood of like web pulled off his head on to his\nshoulders:  he bore a great gold ring on his left arm, and a collar\nof gold came down on to his breast from under his hood.\n\nAs for the woman, she was clad in a long white linen smock, and over\nit a short gown of dark blue woollen, and she had skin shoes on her\nfeet.\n\nNow the man came up to Face-of-god, and took his hand and said:  'I\ndeemed thee a foe, and I may not have over-many foes alive:  but it\nseems that thou art to be a friend, and that is well and better; so\nherewith I handsel thee self-doom in the matter of the onslaught.'\n\nThen Face-of-god laughed and said:  'The doom is soon given forth;\nagainst the tumble on the grass I set the clout on the head; there is\nnought left over to pay to any man's son.'\n\nSaid the scarlet-clad man:  'Belike by thine eyes thou art a true\nman, and wilt not bewray me.  Now is there no foeman here, but rather\nmaybe a friend both now and in time to come.'  Therewith he cast his\narms about Face-of-god and kissed him.  But Face-of-god turned about\nto the woman and said:  'Is the peace wholly made?'\n\nShe shook her head and said soberly:  'Nay, thou art too fair for a\nwoman to kiss.'\n\nHe flushed red, as his wont was when a woman praised him; yet was his\nheart full of pleasure and well-liking.  But she laid her hand on his\nshoulder and said:  'Now is it for thee to choose betwixt the wild-\nwood and the hall, and whether thou wilt be a guest or a wayfarer\nthis night.'\n\nAs she touched him there took hold of him a sweetness of pleasure he\nhad never felt erst, and he answered:  'I will be thy guest and not\nthy stranger.'\n\n'Come then,' she said, and took his hand in hers, so that he scarce\nfelt the earth under his feet, as they went all three together toward\nthe house in the gathering dusk, while eastward where the peaks of\nthe great mountains dipped was a light that told of the rising of the\nmoon.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.  OF FACE-OF-GOD AND THOSE MOUNTAIN-DWELLERS\n\n\n\nA yard or two from the threshold Gold-mane hung back a moment,\nentangled in some such misgiving as a man is wont to feel when he is\njust about to do some new deed, but is not yet deep in the story; his\nnew friends noted that, for they smiled each in their own way, and\nthe woman drew her hand away from his.  Face-of-god held out his\nstill as though to take hers again, and therewithal he changed\ncountenance and said as though he had stayed but to ask that\nquestion:\n\n'Tell me thy name, tall man; and thou, fair woman, tell me thine; for\nhow can we talk together else?'\n\nThe man laughed outright and said:  'The young chieftain thinks that\nthis house also should be his!  Nay, young man, I know what is in thy\nthought, be not ashamed that thou art wary; and be assured!  We shall\nhurt thee no more than thou hast been hurt.  Now as to my name; the\nname that was born with me is gone:  the name that was given me hath\nbeen taken from me:  now I belike must give myself a name, and that\nshall be Wild-wearer; but it may be that thou thyself shalt one day\ngive me another, and call me Guest.'\n\nHis sister gazed at him solemnly as he spoke, and Face-of-god\nbeholding her the while, deemed that her beauty grew and grew till\nshe seemed as aweful as a Goddess; and into his mind it came that\nthis over-strong man and over-lovely woman were nought mortal, and\nthey withal dealing with him as father and mother deal with a wayward\nchild:  then for a moment his heart failed him, and he longed for the\npeace of Burgdale, and even the lonely wood.  But therewith she\nturned to him and let her hand come into his again, and looked kindly\non him and said:  'And as for me, call me the Friend; the name is\ngood and will serve for many things.'\n\nHe looked down from her face and his eyes lighted on her hand, and\nwhen he noted even amid the evening dusk how fair and lovely it was\nfashioned, and yet as though it were deft in the crafts that the\ndaughters of menfolk use, his fear departed, and the pleasure of his\nlonging filled his heart, and he drew her hand to him to kiss it; but\nshe held it back.  Then he said:  'It is the custom of the Dale to\nall women.'\n\nSo she let him kiss her hand, heeding the kiss nothing, and said\nsoberly:\n\n'Then art thou of Burgdale, and if it were lawful to guess, I would\nsay that thy name is Face-of-god, of the House of the Face.'\n\n'Even so it is,' said he, 'but in the Dale those that love me do\nmostly call me Gold-mane.'\n\n'It is well named,' she said, 'and seldom wilt thou be called\notherwise, for thou wilt be well-beloved.  But come in now, Gold-\nmane, for night is at hand, and here have we meat and lodging such as\nan hungry and weary man may take; though we be broken people,\ndwellers in the waste.'\n\nTherewith she led him gently over the threshold into the hall, and it\nseemed to him as if she were the fairest and the noblest of all the\nQueens of ancient story.\n\nWhen he was in the house he looked and saw that, rough as it was\nwithout it lacked not fairness within.  The floor was of hard-trodden\nearth strewn with pine-twigs, and with here and there brown bearskins\nlaid on it:  there was a standing table near the upper end athwart\nthe hall, and a days beyond that, but no endlong table.  Gold-mane\nlooked to the shut-beds, and saw that they were large and fair,\nthough there were but a few of them; and at the lower end was a loft\nfor a sleeping chamber dight very fairly with broidered cloths.  The\nhangings on the walls, though they left some places bare which were\nhung with fresh boughs, were fairer than any he had ever seen, so\nthat he deemed that they must come from far countries and the City of\nCities:  therein were images wrought of warriors and fair women of\nold time and their dealings with the Gods and the Giants, and\nWondrous wights; and he deemed that this was the story of some great\nkindred, and that their token and the sign of their banner must needs\nbe the Wood-wolf, for everywhere was it wrought in these pictured\nwebs.  Perforce he looked long and earnestly at these fair things,\nfor the hall was not dark yet, because the brands on the hearth were\nflaming their last, and when Wild-wearer beheld him so gazing, he\nstood up and looked too for a moment, and then smote his right hand\non the hilt of his sword, and turned away and strode up and down the\nhall as one in angry thought.\n\nBut the woman, even the Friend, bestirred herself for the service of\nthe guest, and brought water for his hands and feet, and when she had\nwashed him, bore him the wine of Welcome and drank to him and bade\nhim drink; and he all the while was shamefaced; for it was to him as\nif one of the Ladies of the Heavenly Burg were doing him service.\nThen she went away by a door at the lower end of the hall, and Wild-\nwearer came and sat down by Gold-mane, and fell a-talking with him\nabout the ways of the Dalesmen, and their garths, and the pastures\nand growths thereof; and what temper the carles themselves were of;\nwhich were good men, which were ill, which was loved and which\nscorned; no otherwise than if he had been the goodman of some\nneighbouring dale; and Gold-mane told him whatso he knew, for he saw\nno harm therein.\n\nAfter a while the outer door opened, and there came in a woman of\nsome five-and-twenty winters, trimly and strongly built; short-\nskirted she was and clad as a hunter, with a bow in her hand and a\nquiver at her back:  she unslung a pouch, which she emptied at Wild-\nwearer's feet of a leash of hares and two brace of mountain grouse;\nof Face-of-god she took but little heed.\n\nSaid Wild-wearer:  'This is good for to-morrow, not for to-day; the\nmeat is well-nigh on the board.'\n\nThen Gold-mane smiled, for he called to mind his home-coming of\nyesterday.  But the woman said:\n\n'The fault is not mine; she told me of the coming guest but three\nhours agone.'\n\n'Ay?' said Wild-wearer, 'she looked for a guest then?'\n\n'Yea, certes,' said the woman, 'else why went I forth this afternoon,\nas wearied as I was with yesterday?'\n\n'Well, well,' said Wild-wearer, 'get to thy due work or go play; I\nmeddle not with meat! and for thee all jests are as bitter earnest.'\n\n'And with thee, chief,' she said, 'it is no otherwise; surely I am\nmade on thy model.'\n\n'Thy tongue is longer, friend,' said he; 'now tarry if thou wilt, and\nif the supper's service craveth thee not.'\n\nShe turned away with one keen look at Face-of-god, and departed\nthrough the door at the lower end of the hall.\n\nBy this time the hall was dusk, for there were no candles there, and\nthe hearth-fire was but smouldering.  Wild-wearer sat silent and\nmusing now, and Face-of-god spake not, for he was deep in wild and\nhappy dreams.  At last the lower door opened and the fair woman came\ninto the hall with a torch in either hand, after whom came the\nhuntress, now clad in a dark blue kirtle, and an old woman yet\nstraight and hale; and these twain bore in the victuals and the\ntable-gear.  Then the three fell to dighting the board, and when it\nwas all ready, and Gold-mane and Wild-wearer were set down to it, and\nwith them the fair woman and the huntress, the old woman threw good\nstore of fresh brands on the hearth, so that the light shone into\nevery corner; and even therewith the outer door opened, and four more\nmen entered, whereof one was old, but big and stalwarth, the other\nthree young:  they were all clad roughly in sheep-brown weed, but had\nhelms upon their heads and spears in their hands and great swords\ngirt to their sides; and they seemed doughty men and ready for\nbattle.  One of the young men cast down by the door the carcass of a\nbig-horned mountain sheep, and then they all trooped off to the out-\nbower by the lower door, and came back presently fairly clad and\nwithout their weapons.  Wild-wearer nodded to them kindly, and they\nsat at table paying no more heed to Face-of-god than to cast him a\nnod for salutation.\n\nThen said the old woman to them:  'Well, lads, have ye been doing or\nsleeping?'\n\n'Sleeping, mother,' said one of the young men, 'as was but due after\nlast night was, and to-morrow shall be.'\n\nSaid the huntress:  'Hold thy peace, Wood-wise, and let thy tongue\nhelp thy teeth to deal with thy meat; for this is not the talking\nhour.'\n\n'Nay, Bow-may,' said another of the swains, 'since here is a new man,\nnow is the time to talk to him.'\n\nSaid the huntress:  ''Tis thine hands that talk best, Wood-wont; it\nis not they that shall bring thee to shame.'\n\nSpake the third:  'What have we to do with shame here, far away from\ndooms and doomers, and elders, and wardens, and guarded castles?  If\nthe new man listeth to speak, let him speak; or to fight, then let\nhim; it shall ever be man to man.'\n\nThen spake the old woman:  'Son Wood-wicked, hold thy peace, and\nforget the steel that ever eggeth thee on to draw.'\n\nTherewith she set the last matters on the board, while the three\nswains sat and eyed Gold-mane somewhat fiercely, now that words had\nstirred them, and he had sat there saying nothing, as one who was\nbetter than they, and contemned them; but now spake Wild-wearer:\n\n'Whoso hungreth let him eat!  Whoso would slumber, let him to bed.\nBut he who would bicker, it must needs be with me.  Here is a man of\nthe Dale, who hath sought the wood in peace, and hath found us.  His\nhand is ready and his heart is guileless:  if ye fear him, run away\nto the wood, and come back when he is gone; but none shall mock him\nwhile I sit by:  now, lads, be merry and blithe with the guest.'\n\nThen the young men greeted Gold-mane, and the old man said:  'Art\nthou of Burgstead? then wilt thou be of the House of the Face, and\nthy name will be Face-of-god; for that man is called the fairest of\nthe Dale, and there shall be none fairer than thou.'\n\nFace-of-god laughed and said:  'There be but few mirrors in Burgdale,\nand I have no mind to journey west to the cities to see what manner\nof man I be:  that were ill husbandry.  But now I have heard the\nnames of the three swains, tell me thy name, father!'\n\nSpake the huntress:  'This is my father's brother, and his name is\nWood-father; or ye shall call him so:  and I am called Bow-may\nbecause I shoot well in the bow:  and this old carline is my eme's\nwife, and now belike my mother, if I need one.  But thou, fair-faced\nDalesman, little dost thou need a mirror in the Dale so long as women\nabide there; for their faces shall be instead of mirrors to tell thee\nwhether thou be fair and lovely.'\n\nThereat they all laughed and fell to their victual, which was\nabundant, of wood-venison and mountain-fowl, but of bread was no\ngreat plenty; wine lacked not, and that of the best; and Gold-mane\nnoted that the cups and the apparel of the horns and mazers were not\nof gold nor gilded copper, but of silver; and he marvelled thereat,\nfor in the Dale silver was rare.\n\nSo they ate and drank, and Gold-mane looked ever on the Friend, and\nspake much with her, and he deemed her friendly indeed, and she\nseemed most pleased when he spoke best, and led him on to do so.\nWild-wearer was but of few words, and those somewhat harsh; yet was\nhe as a man striving to be courteous and blithe; but of the others\nBow-may was the greatest speaker.\n\nWild-wearer called healths to the Sun, and the Moon, and the Hosts of\nHeaven; to the Gods of the Earth; to the Woodwights; and to the\nGuest.  Other healths also he called, the meaning of which was dark\nto Gold-mane; to wit, the Jaws of the Wolf; the Silver Arm; the Red\nHand; the Golden Bushel; and the Ragged Sword.  But when he asked the\nFriend concerning these names what they might signify, she shook her\nhead and answered not.\n\nAt last Wild-wearer cried out:  'Now, lads, the night weareth and the\nguest is weary:  therefore whoso of you hath in him any minstrelsy,\nnow let him make it, for later on it shall be over-late.'\n\nThen arose Wood-wont and went to his shut-bed and groped therein, and\ntook from out of it a fiddle in its case; and he opened the case and\ndrew from it a very goodly fiddle, and he stood on the floor amidst\nof the hall and Bow-may his cousin with him; and he laid his bow on\nthe fiddle and woke up song in it, and when it was well awake she\nfell a-singing, and he to answering her song, and at the last all\nthey of the house sang together; and this is the meaning of the words\nwhich they sang:\n\n\nShe singeth.\n\nNow is the rain upon the day,\n   And every water's wide;\nWhy busk ye then to wear the way,\n   And whither will ye ride?\n\nHe singeth.\n\nOur kine are on the eyot still,\n   The eddies lap them round;\nAll dykes the wind-worn waters fill,\n   And waneth grass and ground.\n\nShe singeth.\n\nO ride ye to the river's brim\n   In war-weed fair to see?\nOr winter waters will ye swim\n   In hauberks to the knee?\n\nHe singeth.\n\nWild is the day, and dim with rain,\n   Our sheep are warded ill;\nThe wood-wolves gather for the plain,\n   Their ravening maws to fill.\n\nShe singeth.\n\nNay, what is this, and what have ye,\n   A hunter's band, to bear\nThe Banner of our Battle-glee\n   The skulking wolves to scare?\n\nHe singeth.\n\nO women, when we wend our ways\n   To deal with death and dread,\nThe Banner of our Fathers' Days\n   Must flap the wind o'erhead.\n\nShe singeth.\n\nAh, for the maidens that ye leave!\n   Who now shall save the hay?\nWhat grooms shall kiss our lips at eve,\n   When June hath mastered May?\n\nHe singeth.\n\nThe wheat is won, the seed is sown,\n   Here toileth many a maid,\nAnd ere the hay knee-deep hath grown\n   Your grooms the grass shall wade.\n\nThey sing all together.\n\nThen fair befall the mountain-side\n   Whereon the play shall be!\nAnd fair befall the summer-tide\n   That whoso lives shall see.\n\n\nFace-of-god thought the song goodly, but to the others it was well\nknown.  Then said Wood-father:\n\n'O foster-son, thy foster-brother hath sung well for a wood abider;\nbut we are deeming that his singing shall be but as a starling to a\nthrostle matched against thy new-come guest.  Therefore, Dalesman,\nsing us a song of the Dale, and if ye will, let it be of gardens and\npleasant houses of stone, and fair damsels therein, and swains with\nthem who toil not over-much for a scant livelihood, as do they of the\nwaste, whose heads may not be seen in the Holy Places.'\n\nSaid Gold-mane:  'Father, it is ill to set the words of a lonely man\nafar from his kin against the song that cometh from the heart of a\nnoble house; yet may I not gainsay thee, but will sing to thee what I\nmay call to mind, and it is called the Song of the Ford.'\n\nTherewith he sang in a sweet and clear voice:  and this is the\nmeaning of his words:\n\n\nIn hay-tide, through the day new-born,\n   Across the meads we come;\nOur hauberks brush the blossomed corn\n   A furlong short of home.\n\nEre yet the gables we behold\n   Forth flasheth the red sun,\nAnd smites our fallow helms and cold\n   Though all the fight be done.\n\nIn this last mend of mowing-grass\n   Sweet doth the clover smell,\nCrushed neath our feet red with the pass\n   Where hell was blent with hell.\n\nAnd now the willowy stream is nigh,\n   Down wend we to the ford;\nNo shafts across its fishes fly,\n   Nor flasheth there a sword.\n\nBut lo! what gleameth on the bank\n   Across the water wan,\nAs when our blood the mouse-ear drank\n   And red the river ran?\n\nNay, hasten to the ripple clear,\n   Look at the grass beyond!\nLo ye the dainty band and dear\n   Of maidens fair and fond!\n\nLo how they needs must take the stream!\n   The water hides their feet;\nOn fair kind arms the gold doth gleam,\n   And midst the ford we meet.\n\nUp through the garden two and two,\n   And on the flowers we drip;\nTheir wet feet kiss the morning dew\n   As lip lies close to lip.\n\nHere now we sing; here now we stay:\n   By these grey walls we tell\nThe love that lived from out the fray,\n   The love that fought and fell.\n\n\nWhen he was done they all said that he had sung well, and that the\nsong was sweet.  Yet did Wild-wearer smile somewhat; and Bow-may said\noutright:  'Soft is the song, and hath been made by lads and\nminstrels rather than by warriors.'\n\n'Nay, kinswoman,' said Wood-father, 'thou art hard to please; the\nguest is kind, and hath given us that I asked for, and I give him all\nthanks therefor.'\n\nFace-of-god smiled, but he heeded little what they said, for as he\nsang he had noted that the Friend looked kindly on him; and he\nthought he saw that once or twice she put out her hand as if to touch\nhim, but drew it back again each time.  She spake after a little and\nsaid:\n\n'Here now hath been a stream of song running betwixt the Mountain and\nthe Dale even as doth a river; and this is good to come between our\ndreams of what hath been and what shall be.'  Then she turned to\nGold-mane, and said to him scarce loud enough for all to hear:\n\n'Herewith I bid thee good-night, O Dalesman; and this other word I\nhave to thee:  heed not what befalleth in the night, but sleep thy\nbest, for nought shall be to thy scathe.  And when thou wakest in the\nmorning, if we are yet here, it is well; but if we are not, then\nabide us no long while, but break thy fast on the victual thou wilt\nfind upon the board, and so depart and go thy ways home.  And yet\nthou mayst look to it to see us again before thou diest.'\n\nTherewith she held out her hand to him, and he took it and kissed it;\nand she went to her chamber-aloft at the lower end of the hall.  And\nwhen she was gone, once more he had a deeming of her that she was of\nthe kindred of the Gods.  At her departure him-seemed that the hall\ngrew dull and small and smoky, and the night seemed long to him and\ndoubtful the coming of the day.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.  FACE-OF-GOD TALKETH WITH THE FRIEND ON THE MOUNTAIN\n\n\n\nSo now went all men to bed; and Face-to-god's shut-bed was over\nagainst the outer door and toward the lower end of the hall, and on\nthe panel about it hung the weapons and shields of men.  Fair was\nthat chamber and roomy, and the man was weary despite his eagerness,\nso that he went to sleep as soon as his head touched the pillow; but\nwithin a while (he deemed about two hours after midnight) he was\nawaked by the clattering of the weapons against the panel, and the\nsound of men's hands taking them down; and when he was fully awake,\nhe heard withal men going up and down the house as if on errands:\nbut he called to mind what the Friend had said to him, and he did not\nso much as turn himself toward the hall; for he said:  'Belike these\nmen are outlaws and Wolves of the Holy Places, yet by seeming they\nare good fellows and nought churlish, nor have I to do with taking up\nthe feud against them.  I will abide the morning.  Yet meseemeth that\nshe drew me hither:  for what cause?'\n\nTherewith he fell asleep again, and dreamed no more.  But when he\nawoke the sun was shining broad upon the hall-floor, and he sat up\nand listened, but could hear no sound save the moaning of the wind in\nthe pine-boughs and the chatter of the starlings about the gables of\nthe house; and the place seemed so exceeding lonely to him that he\nwas in a manner feared by that loneliness.\n\nThen he arose and clad himself, and went forth into the hall and\ngazed about him, and at first he deemed indeed that there was no one\ntherein.  But at last he looked and beheld the upper gable and there\nunderneath a most goodly hanging was the glorious shape of a woman\nsitting on a bench covered over with a cloth of gold and silver; and\nhe looked and looked to see if the woman might stir, and if she were\nalive, and she turned her head toward him, and lo it was the Friend;\nand his heart rose to his mouth for wonder and fear and desire.  For\nnow he doubted whether the other folk were aught save shows and\nshadows, and she the Goddess who had fashioned them out of nothing\nfor his bewilderment, presently to return to nothing.\n\nYet whatever he might fear or doubt, he went up the hall towards her\ntill he was quite nigh to her, and there he stood silent, wondering\nat her beauty and desiring her kindness.\n\nGrey-eyed she was like her brother; but her hair the colour of red\nwheat:  her lips full and red, her chin round, her nose fine and\nstraight.  Her hands and all her body fashioned exceeding sweetly and\ndelicately; yet not as if she were an image of which the like might\nbe found if the craftsman were but deft enough to make a perfect\nthing, but in such a way that there was none like to her for those\nthat had eyes to behold her as she was; and none could ever be made\nlike to her, even by such a master-craftsman as could fashion a body\nwithout a blemish.\n\nShe was clad in a white smock, whose hems were broidered with gold\nwire and precious gems of the Mountains, and over that a gown woven\nof gold and silver:  scarce hath the world such another.  On her head\nwas a fillet of gold and gems, and there were wondrous gold rings on\nher arms:  her feet lay bare on the dark grey wolf-skin that was\nstretched before her.\n\nShe smiled kindly upon his solemn and troubled face, and her voice\nsounded strangely familiar to him coming from all that loveliness, as\nshe said:  'Hail, Face-of-god! here am I left alone, although I\ndeemed last night that I should be gone with the others.  Therefore\nam I fain to show myself to thee in fairer array than yesternight;\nfor though we dwell in the wild-wood, from the solace of folk, yet\nare we not of thralls' blood.  But come now, I bid thee break thy\nfast and talk with me a little while; and then shalt thou depart in\npeace.'\n\nSpake Face-of-god, and his voice trembled as he spake:  'What art\nthou?  Last night I deemed at whiles once and again that thou wert of\nthe Gods; and now that I behold thee thus, and it is broad daylight,\nand of those others is no more to be seen than if they had never\nlived, I cannot but deem that it is even so, and that thou comest\nfrom the City that shall never perish.  Now if thou be a goddess, I\nhave nought to pray thee, save to slay me speedily if thou hast a\nmind for my death.  But if thou art a woman--'\n\nShe broke in:  'Gold-mane, stay thy prayer and hold thy peace for\nthis time, lest thou repent when repentance availeth not.  And this I\nsay because I am none of the Gods nor akin to them, save far off\nthrough the generations, as art thou also, and all men of goodly\nkindred.  Now I bid thee eat thy meat, since 'tis ill talking betwixt\na full man and a fasting; and I have dight it myself with mine own\nhands; for Bow-may and the Wood-mother went away with the rest three\nhours before dawn.  Come sit and eat as thou hast a hardy heart; as\nforsooth thou shouldest do if I were a very goddess.  Take heed,\nfriend, lest I take thee for some damsel of the lower Dale arrayed in\nEarl's garments.'\n\nShe laughed therewith, and leaned toward him and put forth her hand\nto him, and he took it and caressed it; and the exceeding beauty of\nher body and of the raiment which was as it were a part of her and\nher loveliness, made her laughter and her friendly words strange to\nhim, as if one did not belong to the other; as in a dream it might\nbe.  Nevertheless he did as she bade him, and sat at the board and\nate, while she leaned forward on the arm of her chair and spake to\nhim in friendly wise.  And he wondered as she spake that she knew so\nmuch of him and his:  and he kept saying to himself:  'She drew me\nhither; wherefore did she so?'\n\nBut she said:  'Gold-mane, how fareth thy father the Alderman? is he\nas good a wright as ever?'\n\nHe told her:  Yea, that ever was his hammer on the iron, the copper,\nand the gold, and that no wright in the Dale was as deft as he.\n\nSaid she:  'Would he not have had thee seek to the Cities, to see the\nways of the outer world?'\n\n'Yea,' said he.\n\nShe said:  'Thou wert wise to naysay that offer; thou shalt have\nenough to do in the Dale and round about it in twelve months' time.'\n\n'Art thou foresighted?' said he.\n\n'Folk have called me so,' she said, 'but I wot not.  But thy brother\nHall-face, how fareth he?'\n\n'Well;' said he, 'to my deeming he is the Sword of our House, and the\nWarrior of the Dale, if the days were ready for him.'\n\n'And Stone-face, that stark ancient,' she said, 'doth he still love\nthe Folk of the Dale, and hate all other folks?'\n\n'Nay,' he said, 'I know not that, but I know that he loveth as, and\nabove all me and my father.'\n\nAgain she spake:  'How fareth the Bride, the fair maid to whom thou\nart affianced?'\n\nAs she spake, it was to him as if his heart was stricken cold; but he\nput a force upon himself, and neither reddened nor whitened, nor\nchanged countenance in any way; so he answered:\n\n'She was well the eve of yesterday.'  Then he remembered what she\nwas, and her beauty and valour, and he constrained himself to say:\n'Each day she groweth fairer; there is no man's son and no daughter\nof woman that does not love her; yea, the very beasts of field and\nfold love her.'\n\nThe Friend looked at him steadily and spake no word, but a red flush\nmounted to her cheeks and brow and changed her face; and he marvelled\nthereat; for still he misdoubted that she was a Goddess.  But it\npassed away in a moment, and she smiled and said:\n\n'Guest, thou seemest to wonder that I know concerning thee and the\nDale and thy kindred.  But now shalt thou wot that I have been in the\nDale once and again, and my brother oftener still; and that I have\nseen thee before yesterday.'\n\n'That is marvellous,' quoth he, 'for sure am I that I have not seen\nthee.'\n\n'Yet thou hast seen me,' she said; 'yet not altogether as I am now;'\nand therewith she smiled on him friendly.\n\n'How is this?' said he; 'art thou a skin-changer?'\n\n'Yea, in a fashion,' she said.  'Hearken! dost thou perchance\nremember a day of last summer when there was a market holden in\nBurgstead; and there stood in the way over against the House of the\nFace a tall old carle who was trucking deer-skins for diverse gear;\nand with him was a queen, tall and dark-skinned, somewhat well-\nliking, her hair bound up in a white coif so that none of it could be\nseen; by the token that she had a large stone of mountain blue set in\nsilver stuck in the said coif?'\n\nAs she spoke she set her hand to her bosom and drew something from\nit, and held forth her hand to Gold-mane, and lo amidst the palm the\ngreat blue stone set in silver.\n\n'Wondrous as a dream is this,' said Face-of-god, 'for these twain I\nremember well, and what followed.'\n\nShe said:  'I will tell thee that.  There came a man of the Shepherd-\nFolk, drunk or foolish, or both, who began to chaffer with the big\ncarle; but ever on the queen were his eyes set, and presently he put\nforth his hand to her to clip her, whereon the big carle hove up his\nfist and smote him, so that he fell to earth noseling.  Then ran the\nfolk together to hale off the stranger and help the shepherd, and it\nwas like that the stranger should be mishandled.  Then there thrust\nthrough the press a young man with yellow hair and grey eyes, who\ncried out, \"Fellows, let be!  The stranger had the right of it; this\nis no matter to make a quarrel or a court case of.  Let the market go\non!  This man and maid are true folk.\"  So when the folk heard the\nyoung man and his bidding, they forebore and let the carle and the\nqueen be, and the shepherd went his ways little hurt.  Now then, who\nwas this young man?'\n\nQuoth Gold-mane:  'It was even I, and meseemeth it was no great deed\nto do.'\n\n'Yea,' she said, 'and the big carle was my brother, and the tall\nqueen, it was myself.'\n\n'How then,' said he, 'for she was as dark-skinned as a dwarf, and\nthou so bright and fair?'\n\nShe said:  'Well, if the woods are good for nothing else, yet are\nthey good for the growing of herbs, and I know the craft of simpling;\nand with one of these herbs had I stained my skin and my brother's\nalso.  And it showed the darker beneath the white coif.'\n\n'Yea,' said he, 'but why must ye needs fare in feigned shapes?  Ye\nwould have been welcome guests in the Dale howsoever ye had come.'\n\n'I may not tell thee hereof as now,' said she.\n\nSaid Gold-mane:  'Yet thou mayst belike tell me wherefore was that\nthy brother desired to slay me yesterday, if he knew me, who I was.'\n\n'Gold-mane,' she said, 'thou art not slain, so little story need be\nmade of that:  for the rest, belike he knew thee not at that moment.\nSo it falls with us, that we look to see foes rather than friends in\nthe wild-woods.  Many uncouth things are therein.  Moreover, I must\ntell thee of my brother that whiles he is as the stalled bull late\nlet loose, and nothing is good to him save battle and onset; and then\nis he blind and knows not friend from foe.'  Said Face-of-god:  'Thou\nhast asked of me and mine; wilt thou not tell me of thee and thine?'\n\n'Nay,' she said, 'not as now; thou must betake thee to the way.\nWhither wert thou wending when thou happenedst upon us?'\n\nHe said:  'I know not; I was seeking something, but I knew not what--\nmeseemeth that now I have found it.'\n\n'Art thou for the great mountains seeking gems?' she said.  'Yet go\nnot thither to-day:  for who knoweth what thou shalt meet there that\nshall be thy foe?'\n\nHe said:  'Nay, nay; I have nought to do but to abide here as long as\nI may, looking upon thee and hearkening to thy voice.'\n\nHer eyes were upon his, but yet she did not seem to see him, and for\na while she answered not; and still he wondered that mere words\nshould come from so fair a thing; for whether she moved foot, or\nhand, or knee, or turned this way or that, each time she stirred it\nwas a caress to his very heart.\n\nHe spake again:  'May I not abide here a while?  What scathe may be\nin that?'\n\n'It is not so,' she said; 'thou must depart, and that straightway:\nlo, there lieth thy spear which the Wood-mother hath brought in from\nthe waste.  Take thy gear to thee and wend thy ways.  Have patience!\nI will lead thee to the place where we first met and there give thee\nfarewell.'\n\nTherewith she arose and he also perforce, and when they came to the\ndoorway she stepped across the threshold and then turned back and\ngave him her hand and so led him forth, the sun flashing back from\nher golden raiment.  Together they went over the short grey grass of\nthat hillside till they came to the place where he had arisen from\nthat wrestle with her brother.  There she stayed him and said:\n\n'This is the place; here must we part.'\n\nBut his heart failed him and he faltered in his speech as he said:\n\n'When shall I see thee again?  Wilt thou slay me if I seek to thee\nhither once more?'\n\n'Hearken,' she said, 'autumn is now a-dying into winter:  let winter\nand its snows go past:  nor seek to me hither; for me thou should'st\nnot find, but thy death thou mightest well fall in with; and I would\nnot that thou shouldest die.  When winter is gone, and spring is on\nthe land, if thou hast not forgotten us thou shalt meet us again.\nYet shalt thou go further than this Woodland Hall.  In Shadowy Vale\nshalt thou seek to me then, and there will I talk with thee.'\n\n'And where,' said he, 'is Shadowy Vale? for thereof have I never\nheard tell.'\n\nShe said:  'The token when it cometh to thee shall show thee thereof\nand the way thither.  Art thou a babbler, Gold-mane?'\n\nHe said:  'I have won no prize for babbling hitherto.'\n\nShe said:  'If thou listest to babble concerning what hath befallen\nthee on the Mountain, so do, and repent it once only, that is, thy\nlife long.'\n\n'Why should I say any word thereof?' said he.  'Dost thou not know\nthe sweetness of such a tale untold?'\n\nHe spake as one who is somewhat wrathful, and she answered humbly and\nkindly:\n\n'Well is that.  Bide thou the token that shall lead thee to Shadowy\nVale.  Farewell now.'\n\nShe drew her hand from his, and turned and went her ways swiftly to\nthe house:  he could not choose but gaze on her as she went\nglittering-bright and fair in that grey place of the mountains, till\nthe dark doorway swallowed up her beauty.  Then he turned away and\ntook the path through the pine-woods, muttering to himself as he\nwent:\n\n'What thing have I done now that hitherto I had not done?  What\nmanner of man am I to-day other than the man I was yesterday?'\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.  FACE-OF-GOD COMETH HOME AGAIN TO BURGSTEAD\n\n\n\nFace-of-God went back through the wood by the way he had come, paying\nlittle heed to the things about him.  For whatever he thought of\nstrayed not one whit from the image of the Fair Woman of the\nMountain-side.\n\nHe went through the wood swiftlier than yesterday, and made no stay\nfor noon or aught else, nor did he linger on the road when he was\ncome into the Dale, either to speak to any or to note what they did.\nSo he came to the House of the Face about dusk, and found no man\nwithin the hall either carle or queen.  So he cried out on the folk,\nand there came in a damsel of the house, whom he greeted kindly and\nshe him again.  He bade her bring the washing-water, and she did so\nand washed his feet and his hands.  She was a fair maid enough, as\nwere most in the Dale, but he heeded her little; and when she was\ndone he kissed not her cheek for her pains, as his wont was, but let\nher go her ways unthanked.  But he went to his shut-bed and opened\nhis chest, and drew fair raiment from it, and did off his wood-gear,\nand did on him a goodly scarlet kirtle fairly broidered, and a collar\nwith gems of price therein, and other braveries.  And when he was so\nattired he came out into the hall, and there was old Stone-face\nstanding by the hearth, which was blazing brightly with fresh brands,\nso that things were clear to see.\n\nStone-face noted Gold-mane's gay raiment, for he was not wont to wear\nsuch attire, save on the feasts and high days when he behoved to.  So\nthe old man smiled and said:\n\n'Welcome back from the Wood!  But what is it?  Hast thou been wedded\nthere, or who hath made thee Earl and King?'\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'Foster-father, sooth it is that I have been to\nthe wood, but there have I seen nought of manfolk worse than myself.\nNow as to my raiment, needs must I keep it from the moth.  And I am\nweary withal, and this kirtle is light and easy to me.  Moreover, I\nlook to see the Bride here again, and I would pleasure her with the\nsight of gay raiment upon me.'\n\n'Nay,' said Stone-face, 'hast thou not seen some woman in the wood\narrayed like the image of a God? and hath she not bidden thee thus to\nworship her to-night?  For I know that such wights be in the wood,\nand that such is their wont.'\n\nSaid Gold-mane:  'I worship nought save the Gods and the Fathers.\nNor saw I in the wood any such as thou sayest.'\n\nTherewith Stone-face shook his head; but after a while he said:\n\n'Art thou for the wood to-morrow?'\n\n'Nay,' said Gold-mane angrily, knitting his brows.\n\n'The morrow of to-morrow,' said Stone-face, 'is the day when we look\nto see the Westland merchants:  after all, wilt thou not go hence\nwith them when they wend their ways back before the first snows\nfall?'\n\n'Nay,' said he, 'I have no mind to it, fosterer; cease egging me on\nhereto.'\n\nThen Stone-face shook his head again, and looked on him long, and\nmuttered:  'To the wood wilt thou go to-morrow or next day; or some\nday when doomed is thine undoing.'\n\nTherewith entered the service and torches, and presently after came\nthe Alderman with Hall-face; and Iron-face greeted his son and said\nto him:  'Thou hast not hit the time to do on thy gay raiment, for\nthe Bride will not be here to-night; she bideth still at the Feast at\nthe Apple-tree House:  or wilt thou be there, son?'\n\n'Nay,' said Face-of-god, 'I am over-weary.  And as for my raiment, it\nis well; it is for thine honour and the honour of the name.'\n\nSo to table they went, and Iron-face asked his son of his ways again,\nand whether he was quite fixed in his mind not to go down to the\nPlain and the Cities:  'For,' said he, 'the morrow of to-morrow shall\nthe merchants be here, and this were great news for them if the son\nof the Alderman should be their faring-fellow back.'\n\nBut Face-of-god answered without any haste or heat:  'Nay, father, it\nmay not be:  fear not, thou shalt see that I have a good will to work\nand live in the Dale.'\n\nAnd in good sooth, though he was a young man and loved mirth and the\nways of his own will, he was a stalwarth workman, and few could mow a\nmatch with him in the hay-month and win it; or fell trees as\ncertainly and swiftly, or drive as straight and clean a furrow\nthrough the stiff land of the lower Dale; and in other matters also\nwas he deft and sturdy.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.  THOSE BRETHREN FARE TO THE YEWWOOD WITH THE BRIDE\n\n\n\nNext morning Face-of-god dight himself for work, and took his axe;\nfor his brother Hall-face had bidden him go down with him to the Yew-\nwood and cut timber there, since he of all men knew where to go\nstraight to the sticks that would quarter best for bow-staves;\nwhereas the Alderman had the right of hewing in that wood.  So they\nwent forth, those brethren, from the House of the Face, but when they\nwere gotten to the gate, who should be there but the Bride awaiting\nthem, and she with an ass duly saddled for bearing the yew-sticks.\nBecause Hall-face had told her that he and belike Gold-mane were\ngoing to hew in the wood, and she thought it good to be of the\ncompany, as oft had befallen erst.  When they met she greeted Face-\nof-god and kissed him as her wont was; and he looked upon her and saw\nhow fair she was, and how kind and friendly were her eyes that beheld\nhim, and how her whole face was eager for him as their lips parted.\nThen his heart failed him, when he knew that he no longer desired her\nas she did him, and he said within himself:\n\n'Would that she had been of our nighest kindred!  Would that I had\nhad a sister and that this were she!'\n\nSo the three went along the highway down the Dale, and Hall-face and\nthe Bride talked merrily together and laughed, for she was happy,\nsince she knew that Gold-mane had been to the wood and was back safe\nand much as he had been before.  So indeed it seemed of him; for\nthough at first he was moody and of few words, yet presently he\ncursed himself for a mar-sport, and so fell into the talk, and\nenforced himself to be merry; and soon he was so indeed; for he\nthought:  'She drew me thither:  she hath a deed for me to do.  I\nshall do the deed and have my reward.  Soon will the spring-tide be\nhere, and I shall be a young man yet when it comes.'\n\nSo came they to the place where he had met the three maidens\nyesterday; there they also turned from the highway; and as they went\ndown the bent, Gold-mane could not but turn his eyes on the beauty of\nthe Bride and the lovely ways of her body:  but presently he\nremembered all that had betid, and turned away again as one who is\nnoting what it behoves him not to note.  And he said to himself:\n'Where art thou, Gold-mane?  Whose art thou?  Yea, even if that had\nbeen but a dream that I have dreamed, yet would that this fair woman\nwere my sister!'\n\nSo came they to the Yew-wood, and the brethren fell to work, and the\nBride with them, for she was deft with the axe and strong withal.\nBut at midday they rested on the green slope without the Yew-wood;\nand they ate bread and flesh and onions and apples, and drank red\nwine of the Dale.  And while they were resting after their meat, the\nBride sang to them, and her song was a lay of time past; and here ye\nhave somewhat of it:\n\n\n'Tis over the hill and over the dale\n   Men ride from the city fast and far,\nIf they may have a soothfast tale,\n   True tidings of the host of war.\n\nAnd first they hap on men-at-arms,\n   All clad in steel from head to foot:\nNow tell true tale of the new-come harms,\n   And the gathered hosts of the mountain-root.\n\nFair sirs, from murder-carles we flee,\n   Whose fashion is as the mountain-trolls';\nNo man can tell how many they be,\n   And the voice of their host as the thunder rolls.\n\nThey were weary men at the ending of day,\n   But they spurred nor stayed for longer word.\nNow ye, O merchants, whither away?\n   What do ye there with the helm and the sword?\n\nO we must fight for life and gear,\n   For our beasts are spent and our wains are stayed,\nAnd the host of the Mountain-men draws near,\n   That maketh all the world afraid.\n\nThey left the chapmen on the hill,\n   And through the eve and through the night\nThey rode to have true tidings still,\n   And were there on the way when the dawn was bright.\n\nO damsels fair, what do ye then\n   To loiter thus upon the way,\nAnd have no fear of the Mountain-men,\n   The host of the carles that strip and slay?\n\nO riders weary with the road,\n   Come eat and drink on the grass hereby!\nAnd lay you down in a fair abode\n   Till the midday sun is broad and high;\n\nThen unto you shall we come aback,\n   And lead you forth to the Mountain-men,\nTo note their plenty and their lack,\n   And have true tidings there and then.\n\n'Tis over the hill and over the dale\n   They ride from the mountain fast and far;\nAnd now have they learned a soothfast tale,\n   True tidings of the host of war.\n\nIt was summer-tide and the Month of Hay,\n   And men and maids must fare afield;\nBut we saw the place were the bow-staves lay,\n   And the hall was hung with spear and shield.\n\nWhen the moon was high we drank in the hall,\n   And they drank to the guests and were kind and blithe,\nAnd they said:  Come back when the chestnuts fall,\n   And the wine-carts wend across the hythe.\n\nCome oft and o'er again, they said;\n   Wander your ways; but we abide\nFor all the world in the little stead;\n   For wise are we, though the world be wide.\n\nYea, come in arms if ye will, they said;\n   And despite your host shall we abide\nFor life or death in the little stead;\n   For wise are we, though the world be wide.\n\n\nSo she made an end and looked at the fairness of the dale spreading\nwide before her, and a robin came nigh from out of a thorn-bush and\nsung his song also, the sweet herald of coming winter; and the\nlapwings wheeled about, black and white, above the meadow by the\nriver, sending forth their wheedling pipe as they hung above the soft\nturf.\n\nShe felt the brothers near her, and knew their friendliness from of\nold, and she was happy; nor had she looked closer at Gold-mane would\nshe have noted any change in him belike; for the meat and the good\nwine, and the fair sunny time, and the Bride's sweet voice, and the\nancient song softened his heart while it fed the desire therein.\n\nSo in a while they arose from their rest and did what was left them\nof their work, and so went back to Burgstead through the fair\nafternoon; by seeming all three in all content.  But yet Gold-mane,\nas from time to time he looked upon the Bride, kept saying to\nhimself:  'O if she had been but my sister! sweet had the kinship\nbeen!'\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.  NEW TIDINGS IN THE DALE\n\n\n\nIt was three days thereafter that Gold-mane, leading an ass, went\nalong the highway to fetch home certain fleeces which were needed for\nthe house from a stead a little west of Wildlake; but he had gone\nscant half a mile ere he fell in with a throng of folk going to\nBurgstead.  They were of the Shepherds; they had weapons with them,\nand some were clad in coats of fence.  They went along making a great\nnoise, for they were all talking each to each at the same time, and\nseemed very hot and eager about some matter.  When they saw Gold-mane\nanigh, they stopped, and the throng opened as if to let him into\ntheir midmost; so he mingled with them, and they stood in a ring\nabout him and an old man more ill-favoured than it was the wont of\nthe Dalesmen to be.\n\nFor he was long, stooping, gaunt and spindle-shanked, his hands big\nand crippled with gout:  his cheeks were red after an old man's\nfashion, covered with a crimson network like a pippin; his lips thin\nand not well hiding his few teeth; his nose long like a snipe's neb.\nIn short, a shame and a laughing-stock to the Folk, and a man whom\nthe kindreds had in small esteem, and that for good reasons.\n\nFace-of-god knew him at once for a notable close-fist and starve-all\nfool of the Shepherds; and his name was now become Penny-thumb the\nLean, whatever it might once have been.\n\nSo Face-of-god greeted all men, and they him again; and he said:\n'What aileth you, neighbours?  Your weapons, are bare, but I see not\nthat they be bloody.  What is it, goodman Penny-thumb?'\n\nPenny-thumb did but groan for all answer; but a stout carle who stood\nby with a broad grin on his face answered and said:\n\n'Face-of-god, evil tidings be abroad; the strong-thieves of the wood\nare astir; and some deem that the wood-wights be helping them.'\n\n'Yea, and what is the deed they have done?' said Gold-mane.\n\nSaid the carle:  'Thou knowest Penny-thumb's abode?'\n\n'Yea surely,' said Face-of-god; 'fair are the water-meadows about it;\ngreat gain of cheese can be gotten thence.'\n\n'Hast thou been within the house?' said the carle.\n\n'Nay,' said Gold-mane.\n\nThen spake Penny-thumb:  'Within is scant gear:  we gather for others\nto scatter; we make meat for others' mouths.'\n\nThe carle laughed:  'Sooth is that,' said he, 'that there is little\ngear therein now; for the strong-thieves have voided both hall and\nbower and byre.'\n\n'And when was that?' said Face-of-god.\n\n'The night before last night,' said the carle, 'the door was smitten\non, and when none answered it was broken down.'\n\n'Yea,' quoth Penny-thumb, 'a host entered, and they in arms.'\n\n'No host was within,' said the carle, 'nought but Penny-thumb and his\nsister and his sister's son, and three carles that work for him; and\none of them, Rusty to wit, was the worst man of the hill-country.\nThese then the host whereof the goodman telleth bound, but without\ndoing them any scathe; and they ransacked the house, and took away\nmuch gear; yet left some.'\n\n'Thou liest,' said Penny-thumb; 'they took little and left none.'\n\nThereat all men laughed, for this seemed to them good game, and\nanother man said:  'Well, neighbour Penny-thumb, if it was so little,\nthou hast done unneighbourly in giving us such a heap of trouble\nabout it.'\n\nAnd they laughed again, but the first carle said:  'True it is,\ngoodman, that thou wert exceeding eager to raise the hue and cry\nafter that little when we happed upon thee and thy housemates bound\nin your chairs yesterday morning.  Well, Alderman's son, short is the\ntale to tell:  we could not fail to follow the gear, and the slot led\nus into the wood, and ill is the going there for us shepherds, who\nare used to the bare downs, save Rusty, who was a good woodsman and\nlifted the slot for us; so he outwent us all, and ran out of sight of\nus, so presently we came upon him dead-slain, with the manslayer's\nspear in his breast.  What then could we do but turn back again, for\nnow was the wood blind now Rusty was dead, and we knew not whither to\nfollow the fray; and the man himself was but little loss:  so back we\nturned, and told goodman Penny-thumb of all this, for we had left him\nalone in his hall lamenting his gear; so we bided to-day's morn, and\nhave come out now, with our neighbour and the spear, and the dead\ncorpse of Rusty.  Stand aside, neighbours, and let the Alderman's son\nsee it.'\n\nThey did so, and there was the corpse of a thin-faced tall wiry man,\nsomewhat foxy of aspect, lying on a hand-bier covered with black\ncloth.\n\n'Yea, Face-of-god,' said the carle, 'he is not good to see now he is\ndead, yet alive was he worser:  but, look you, though the man was no\ngood man, yet was he of our people, and the feud is with us; so we\nwould see the Alderman, and do him to wit of the tidings, that he may\ncall the neighbours together to seek a blood-wite for Rusty and\natonement for the ransacking.  Or what sayest thou?'\n\n'Have ye the spear that ye found in Rusty?' quoth Gold-mane.\n\n'Yea verily,' said the carle.  'Hither with it, neighbours; give it\nto the Alderman's son.'\n\nSo the spear came into his hand, and he looked at it and said:\n\n'This is no spear of the smiths' work of the Dale, as my father will\ntell you.  We take but little keep of the forging of spearheads here,\nso that they be well-tempered and made so as to ride well on the\nshaft; but this head, daintily is it wrought, the blood-trench as\nclean and trim as though it were an Earl's sword.  See you withal\nthis inlaying of runes on the steel?  It is done with no tin or\ncopper, but with very silver; and these bands about the shaft be of\nsilver also.  It is a fair weapon, and the owner hath a loss of it\ngreater than his gain in the slaying of Rusty; and he will have left\nit in the wound so that he might be known hereafter, and that he\nmight be said not to have murdered Rusty but to have slain him.  Or\nhow think ye?'\n\nThey all said that this seemed like to be; but that if the man who\nhad slain Rusty were one of the ransackers they might have a blood-\nwite of him, if they could find him.  Gold-mane said that so it was,\nand therewithal he gave the shepherds good-speed and went on his way.\n\nBut they came to Burgstead and found the Alderman, and in due time\nwas a Court held, and a finding uttered, and outlawry given forth for\nthe manslaying and the ransacking against certain men unknown.  As\nfor the spear, it was laid up in the House of the Face.\n\nBut Face-of-god pondered these matters in his mind, for such\nransackings there had been none of in late years; and he said to\nhimself that his friends of the Mountain must have other folk, of\nwhich the Dalesmen knew nought, whose gear they could lift, or how\ncould they live in that place.  And he marvelled that they should\nrisk drawing the Dalesmen's wrath upon them; whereas they of the Dale\nwere strong men not easily daunted, albeit peaceable enough if not\nstirred to wrath.  For in good sooth he had no doubt concerning that\nspear, whose it was and whence it came:  for that very weapon had\nbeen leaning against the panel of his shut-bed the night he slept on\nthe Mountain, and all the other spears that he saw there were more or\nless of the same fashion, and adorned with silver.\n\nAlbeit all that he knew, and all that he thought of, he kept in his\nown heart and said nothing of it.\n\nSo wore the autumn into early winter; and the Westland merchants came\nin due time, and departed without Face-of-god, though his father made\nhim that offer one last time.  He went to and fro about his work in\nthe Dale, and seemed to most men's eyes nought changed from what he\nhad been.  But the Bride noted that he saw her less often than his\nwont was, and abode with her a lesser space when he met her; and she\ncould not think what this might mean; nor had she heart to ask him\nthereof, though she was sorry and grieved, but rather withdrew her\ncompany from him somewhat; and when she perceived that he noted it\nnot, and made no question of it, then was she the sorrier.\n\nBut the first winter-snow came on with a great storm of wind from the\nnorth-east, so that no man stirred abroad who was not compelled\nthereto, and those who went abroad risked life and limb thereby.\nNext morning all was calm again, and the snow was deep, but it did\nnot endure long, for the wind shifted to the southwest and the thaw\ncame, and three days after, when folk could fare easily again up and\ndown the Dale, came tidings to Burgstead and the Alderman from the\nLower Dale, how a house called Greentofts had been ransacked there,\nand none knew by whom.  Now the goodman of Greentofts was little\nloved of the neighbours:  he was grasping and overbearing, and had\noften cowed others out of their due:  he was very cross-grained, both\nat home and abroad:  his wife had fled from his hand, neither did his\nsons find it good to abide with him:  therewithal he was wealthy of\ngoods, a strong man and a deft man-at-arms.  When his sons and his\nwife departed from him, and none other of the Dalesmen cared to abide\nwith him, he went down into the Plain, and got thence men to be with\nhim for hire, men who were not well seen to in their own land.  These\nto the number of twelve abode with him, and did his bidding whenso it\npleased them.  Two more had he had who had been slain by good men of\nthe Dale for their masterful ways; and no blood-wite had been paid\nfor them, because of their ill-doings, though they had not been made\noutlaws.  This man of Greentofts was called Harts-bane after his\nfather, who was a great hunter.\n\nNow the full tidings of the ransacking were these:  The storm began\ntwo hours before sunset, and an hour thereafter, when it was quite\ndark, for without none could see because the wind was at its height\nand the drift of the snow was hard and full, the hall-door flew open;\nand at first men thought it had been the wind, until they saw in the\ndimness (for all lights but the fire on the hearth had been quenched)\ncertain things tumbling in which at first they deemed were wolves;\nbut when they took swords and staves against them, lo they were met\nby swords and axes, and they saw that the seeming wolves were men\nwith wolf-skins drawn over them.  So the new-comers cowed them that\nthey threw down their weapons, and were bound in their places; but\nwhen they were bound, and had had time to note who the ransackers\nwere, they saw that there were but six of them all told, who had\ncowed and bound Harts-bane and his twelve masterful men; and this\nthey deemed a great shaming to them, as might well be.\n\nSo then the stead was ransacked, and those wolves took away what they\nwould, and went their ways through the fierce storm, and none could\ntell whether they had lived or died in it; but at least neither the\nmen nor their prey were seen again; nor did they leave any slot, for\nnext morning the snow lay deep over everything.\n\nNo doubt had Gold-mane but that these ransackers were his friends of\nthe Mountain; but he held his peace, abiding till the winter should\nbe over.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.  MEN MAKE OATH AT BURGSTEAD ON THE HOLY BOAR\n\n\n\nA week after the ransacking at Greentofts the snow and the winter\ncame on in earnest, and all the Dale lay in snow, and men went on\nskids when they fared up and down the Dale or on the Mountain.\n\nAll was now tidingless till Yule over, and in Burgstead was there\nfeasting and joyance enough; and especially at the House of the Face\nwas high-tide holden, and the Alderman and his sons and Stone-face\nand all the kindred and all their men sat in glorious attire within\nthe hall; and many others were there of the best of the kindreds of\nBurgstead who had been bidden.\n\nFace-of-god sat between his father and Stone-face; and he looked up\nand down the tables and the hall and saw not the Bride, and his heart\nmisgave him because she was not there, and he wondered what had\nbefallen and if she were sick of sorrow.\n\nBut Iron-face beheld him how he gazed about, and he laughed; for he\nwas exceeding merry that night and fared as a young man.  Then he\nsaid to his son:  'Whom seekest thou, son? is there someone lacking?'\n\nFace-of-god reddened as one who lies unused to it, and said:\n\n'Yea, kinsman, so it is that I was seeking the Bride my kinswoman.'\n\n'Nay,' said Iron-face, 'call her not kinswoman:  therein is ill-luck,\nlest it seem that thou art to wed one too nigh thine own blood.  Call\nher the Bride only:  to thee and to me the name is good.  Well, son,\ndesirest thou sorely to see her?'\n\n'Yea, yea, surely,' said Face-of-god; but his eyes went all about the\nhall still, as though his mind strayed from the place and that home\nof his.\n\nSaid Iron-face:  'Have patience, son, thou shalt see her anon, and\nthat in such guise as shall please thee.'\n\nTherewithal came the maidens with the ewers of wine, and they filled\nall horns and beakers, and then stood by the endlong tables on either\nside laughing and talking with the carles and the older women; and\nthe hall was a fair sight to see, for the many candles burned bright\nand the fire on the hearth flared up, and those maids were clad in\nfair raiment, and there was none of them but was comely, and some\nwere fair, and some very fair:  the walls also were hung with goodly\npictured cloths, and the image of the God of the Face looked down\nsmiling terribly from the gable-end above the high-seat.\n\nThus as they sat they heard the sound of a horn winded close outside\nthe hall door, and the door was smitten on.  Then rose Iron-face\nsmiling merrily, and cried out:\n\n'Enter ye, whether ye be friends or foes:  for if ye be foemen, yet\nshall ye keep the holy peace of Yule, unless ye be the foes of all\nkindreds and nations, and then shall we slay you.'\n\nThereat some who knew what was toward laughed; but Gold-mane, who had\nbeen away from Burgstead some days past, marvelled and knit his\nbrows, and let his right hand fall on his sword-hilt.  For this folk,\nwho were of merry ways, were wont to deal diversely with the Yule-\ntide customs in the manner of shows; and he knew not that this was\none of them.\n\nNow was the Outer door thrown open, and there entered seven men,\nwhereof two were all-armed in bright war-gear, and two bore slug-\nhorns, and two bore up somewhat on a dish covered over with a piece\nof rich cloth, and the seventh stood before them all wrapped up in a\ndark fur mantle.\n\nThus they stood a moment; and when he saw their number, back to Gold-\nmane's heart came the thought of those folk on the Mountain:  for\nindeed he was somewhat out of himself for doubt and longing, else\nwould he have deemed that all this was but a Yule-tide play.\n\nNow the men with the slug-horns set them to their mouths and blew a\nlong blast; while the first of the new-comers set hand to the clasps\nof the fur cloak and let it fall to the ground, and lo! a woman\nexceeding beauteous, clad in glistering raiment of gold and fine web;\nher hair wreathed with bay, and in her hand a naked sword with\ngoodly-wrought golden hilt and polished blue-gleaming blade.\n\nFace-of-god started up in his sear, and stared like a man new-wakened\nfrom a strange dream:  because for one moment he deemed verily that\nit was the Woman of the Mountain arrayed as he had last seen her, and\nhe cried aloud 'The Friend, the Friend!'\n\nHis father brake out into loud laughter thereat, and clapped his son\non the shoulder and said:  'Yea, yea, lad, thou mayst well say the\nFriend; for this is thine old playmate whom thou hast been looking\nround the hall for, arrayed this eve in such fashion as is meet for\nher goodliness and her worthiness.  Yea, this is the Friend indeed!'\n\nThen waxed Face-of-god as red as blood for shame, and he sat him down\nin his place again:  for now he wotted what was toward, and saw that\nthis fair woman was the Bride.\n\nBut Stone-face from the other side looked keenly on him.\n\nThen blew the horns again, and the Bride stepped daintily up the\nhall, and the sweet odour of her raiment went from her about the\nfire-warmed dwelling, and her beauty moved all hearts with love.  So\nstood she at the high-table; and those two who bore the burden set it\ndown thereon and drew off the covering, and lo! there was the Holy\nBoar of Yule on which men were wont to make oath of deeds that they\nwould do in the coming year, according to the custom of their\nforefathers.  Then the Bride laid the goodly sword beside the dish,\nand then went round the table and sat down betwixt Face-of-god and\nStone-face, and turned kindly to Gold-mane, and was glad; for now was\nhis fair face as its wont was to be.  He in turn smiled upon her, for\nshe was fair and kind and his fellow for many a day.\n\nNow the men-at-arms stood each side the Boar, and out from them on\neach side stood the two hornsmen:  then these blew up again, whereon\nthe Alderman stood up and cried:\n\n'Ye sons of the brave who have any deed that ye may be desirous of\ndoing, come up, come lay your hand on the sword, and the point of the\nsword to the Holy Beast, and swear the oath that lieth on your\nhearts.'\n\nTherewith he sat down, and there strode a man up the hall, strong-\nbuilt and sturdy, but short of stature; black-haired, red-bearded,\nand ruddy-faced:  and he stood on the dais, and took up the sword and\nlaid its point on the Boar, and said:\n\n'I am Bristler, son of Brightling, a man of the Shepherds.  Here by\nthe Holy Boar I swear to follow up the ransackers of Penny-thumb and\nthe slayers of Rusty.  And I take this feud upon me, although they be\nno good men, because I am of the kin and it falleth to me, since\nothers forbear; and when the Court was hallowed hereon I was away out\nof the Dale and the Downs.  So help me the Warrior, and the God of\nthe Earth.'\n\nThen the Alderman nodded his head to him kindly, and reached him out\na cup of wine, and as he drank there went up a rumour of praise from\nthe hall; and men said that his oath was manly and that he was like\nto keep it; for he was a good man-at-arms and a stout heart.\n\nThen came up three men of the Shepherds and two of the Dale and swore\nto help Bristler in his feud, and men thought it well sworn.\n\nAfter that came a braggart, a man very gay of his raiment, and swore\nwith many words that if he lived the year through he would be a\ncaptain over the men of the Plain, and would come back again with\nmany gifts for his friends in the Dale.  This men deemed foolishly\nsworn, for they knew the man; so they jeered at him and laughed as he\nwent back to his place ashamed.\n\nThen swore three others oaths not hard to be kept, and men laughed\nand were merry.\n\nAt last uprose the Alderman, and said:  'Kinsmen, and good fellows,\ngood days and peaceable are in the Dale as now; and of such days\nlittle is the story, and little it availeth to swear a deed of\nderring-do:  yet three things I swear by this Beast; and first to\ngainsay no man's asking if I may perform it; and next to set right\nabove law and mercy above custom; and lastly, if the days change and\nwar cometh to us or we go to meet it, I will be no backwarder in the\nonset than three fathoms behind the foremost.  So help me the\nWarrior, and the God of the Face and the Holy Earth!'\n\nTherewith he sat down, and all men shouted for joy of him, and said\nthat it was most like that he would keep his oath.\n\nLast of all uprose Face-of-god and took up the sword and looked at\nit; and so bright was the blade that he saw in it the image of the\ngolden braveries which the Bride bore, and even some broken image of\nher face.  Then he handled the hilt and laid the point on the Boar,\nand cried:\n\n'Hereby I swear to wed the fairest woman of the Earth before the year\nis worn to an end; and that whether the Dalesmen gainsay me or the\nmen beyond the Dale.  So help me the Warrior, and the God of the Face\nand the Holy Earth!'\n\nTherewith he sat down; and once more men shouted for the love of him\nand of the Bride, and they said he had sworn well and like a\nchieftain.\n\nBut the Bride noted him that neither were his eyes nor his voice like\nto their wont as he swore, for she knew him well; and thereat was she\nill at ease, for now whatever was new in him was to her a threat of\nevil to come.\n\nStone-face also noted him, and he knew the young man better than all\nothers save the Bride, and he saw withal that she was ill-pleased,\nand he said to himself:  'I will speak to my fosterling to-morrow if\nI may find him alone.'\n\nSo came the swearing to an end, and they fell to on their meat and\nfeasted on the Boar of Atonement after they had duly given the Gods\ntheir due share, and the wine went about the hall and men were merry\ntill they drank the parting cup and fared to rest in the shut-beds,\nand whereso else they might in the Hall and the House, for there were\nmany men there.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.  STONE-FACE TELLETH CONCERNING THE WOOD-WIGHTS\n\n\n\nEarly on the morrow Gold-mane arose and clad himself and went out-a-\ndoors and over the trodden snow on to the bridge over the Weltering\nWater, and there betook himself into one of the coins of safety built\nover the up-stream piles; there he leaned against the wall and turned\nhis face to the Thorp, and fell to pondering on his case.  And first\nhe thought about his oath, and how that he had sworn to wed the\nMountain Woman, although his kindred and her kindred should gainsay\nhim, yea and herself also.  Great seemed that oath to him, yet at\nthat moment he wished he had made it greater, and made all the\nkindred, yea and the Bride herself, sure of the meaning of the words\nof it:  and he deemed himself a dastard that he had not done so.\nThen he looked round him and beheld the winter, and he fell into mere\nlonging that the spring were come and the token from the Mountain.\nThings seemed too hard for him to deal with, and he between a mighty\nfolk and two wayward women; and he went nigh to wish that he had\ntaken his father's offer and gone down to the Cities; and even had he\nmet his bane:  well were that!  And, as young folk will, he set to\nwork making a picture of his deeds there, had he been there.  He\nshowed himself the stricken fight in the plain, and the press, and\nthe struggle, and the breaking of the serried band, and himself\namidst the ring of foemen doing most valiantly, and falling there at\nlast, his shield o'er-heavy with the weight of foemen's spears for a\nman to uphold it.  Then the victory of his folk and the lamentation\nand praise over the slain man of the Mountain Dales, and the burial\nof the valiant warrior, the praising weeping folk meeting him at the\nCity-gate, laid stark and cold in his arms on the gold-hung garlanded\nbier.\n\nThere ended his dream, and he laughed aloud and said:  'I am a fool!\nAll this were good and sweet if I should see it myself; and forsooth\nthat is how I am thinking of it, as if I still alive should see\nmyself dead and famous!'\n\nThen he turned a little and looked at the houses of the Thorp lying\ndark about the snowy ways under the starlit heavens of the winter\nmorning:  dark they were indeed and grey, save where here and there\nthe half-burned Yule-fire reddened the windows of a hall, or where,\nas in one place, the candle of some early waker shone white in a\nchamber window.  There was scarce a man astir, he deemed, and no\nsound reached him save the crowing of the cocks muffled by their\nhouses, and a faint sound of beasts in the byres.\n\nThus he stood a while, his thoughts wandering now, till presently he\nheard footsteps coming his way down the street and turned toward\nthem, and lo it was the old man Stone-face.  He had seen Gold-mane go\nout, and had risen and followed him that he might talk with him\napart.  Gold-mane greeted him kindly, though, sooth to say, he was\nbut half content to see him; since he doubted, what was verily the\ncase, that his foster-father would give him many words, counselling\nhim to refrain from going to the wood, and this was loathsome to him;\nbut he spake and said:\n\n'Meseems, father, that the eastern sky is brightening toward dawn.'\n\n'Yea,' quoth Stone-face.\n\n'It will be light in an hour,' said Face-of-god.\n\n'Even so,' said Stone-face.\n\n'And a fair day for the morrow of Yule,' said the swain.\n\n'Yea,' said Stone-face, 'and what wilt thou do with the fair day?\nWilt thou to the wood?'\n\n'Maybe, father,' said Gold-mane; 'Hall-face and some of the swains\nare talking of elks up the fells which may be trapped in the drifts,\nand if they go a-hunting them, I may go in their company.'\n\n'Ah, son,' quoth Stone-face, 'thou wilt look to see other kind of\nbeasts than elks.  Things may ye fall in with there who may not be\nimpounded in the snow like to elks, but can go light-foot on the top\nof the soft drift from one place to another.'\n\nSaid Gold-mane:  'Father, fear me not; I shall either refrain me from\nthe wood, or if I go, I shall go to hunt the wood-deer with other\nhunters.  But since thou hast come to me, tell me more about the\nwood, for thy tales thereof are fair.'\n\n'Yea,' said Stone-face, 'fair tales of foul things, as oft it\nbefalleth in the world.  Hearken now! if thou deemest that what thou\nseekest shall come readier to thine hand because of the winter and\nthe snow, thou errest.  For the wights that waylay the bodies and\nsouls of the mighty in the wild-wood heed such matters nothing; yea\nand at Yule-tide are they most abroad, and most armed for the fray.\nEven such an one have I seen time agone, when the snow was deep and\nthe wind was rough; and it was in the likeness of a woman clad in\nsuch raiment as the Bride bore last night, and she trod the snow\nlight-foot in thin raiment where it would scarce bear the skids of a\ndeft snow-runner.  Even so she stood before me; the icy wind blew her\nraiment round about her, and drifted the hair from her garlanded head\ntoward me, and she as fair and fresh as in the midsummer days.  Up\nthe fell she fared, sweetest of all things to look on, and beckoned\non me to follow; on me, the Warrior, the Stout-heart; and I followed,\nand between us grief was born; but I it was that fostered that child\nand not she.  Always when she would be, was she merry and lovely; and\neven so is she now, for she is of those that be long-lived.  And I\nwot that thou hast seen even such an one!'\n\n'Tell me more of thy tales, foster-father,' said Gold-mane, 'and fear\nnot for me!'\n\n'Ah, son,' he said, 'mayst thou have no such tales to tell to those\nthat shall be young when thou art old.  Yet hearken!  We sat in the\nhall together and there was no third; and methought that the birds\nsang and the flowers bloomed, and sweet was their savour, though it\nwas midwinter.  A rose-wreath was on her head; grapes were on the\nboard, and fair unwrinkled summer apples on the day that we feasted\ntogether.  When was the feast? sayst thou.  Long ago.  What was the\nhall, thou sayest, wherein ye feasted?  I know not if it were on the\nearth or under it, or if we rode the clouds that even.  But on the\nmorrow what was there but the stark wood and the drift of the snow,\nand the iron wind howling through the branches, and a lonely man, a\nwanderer rising from the ground.  A wanderer through the wood and up\nthe fell, and up the high mountain, and up and up to the edges of the\nice-river and the green caves of the ice-hills.  A wanderer in\nspring, in summer, autumn and winter, with an empty heart and a\nburning never-satisfied desire; who hath seen in the uncouth places\nmany an evil unmanly shape, many a foul hag and changing ugly\nsemblance; who hath suffered hunger and thirst and wounding and\nfever, and hath seen many things, but hath never again seen that fair\nwoman, or that lovely feast-hall.\n\n'All praise and honour to the House of the Face, and the bounteous\nvaliant men thereof! and the like praise and honour to the fair women\nwhom they wed of the valiant and goodly House of the Steer!'\n\n'Even so say I,' quoth Gold-mane calmly; 'but now wend we aback to\nthe House, for it is morning indeed, and folk will be stirring\nthere.'\n\nSo they turned from the bridge together; and Stone-face was kind and\nfatherly, and was telling his foster-son many wise things concerning\nthe life of a chieftain, and the giving-out of dooms and the\ngathering for battle; to all which talk Face-of-god seemed to hearken\ngladly, but indeed hearkened not at all; for verily his eyes were\nbeholding that snowy waste, and the fair woman upon it; even such an\none as Stone-face had told of.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.  THEY FARE TO THE HUNTING OF THE ELK\n\n\n\nWhen they came into the Hall, the hearth-fire had been quickened, and\nthe sleepers on the floor had been wakened, and all folk were astir.\nSo the old man sat down by the hearth while Gold-mane busied himself\nin fetching wood and water, and in sweeping out the Hall, and other\nsuch works of the early morning.  In a little while Hall-face and the\nother young men and warriors were afoot duly clad, and the Alderman\ncame from his chamber and greeted all men kindly.  Soon meat was set\nupon the boards, and men broke their fast; and day dawned while they\nwere about it, and ere it was all done the sun rose clear and golden,\nso that all men knew that the day would be fair, for the frost seemed\nhard and enduring.\n\nThen the eager young men and the hunters, and those who knew the\nmountain best drew together about the hearth, and fell to talking of\nthe hunting of the elk; and there were three there who knew both the\nwoods and also the fells right up to the ice-rivers better than any\nother; and these said that they who were fain of the hunting of the\nelk would have no likelier time than that day for a year to come.\nShort was the rede betwixt them, for they said they would go to the\nwork at once and make the most of the short winter daylight.  So they\nwent each to his place, and some outside that House to their fathers'\nhouses to fetch each man his gear.  Face-of-god for his part went to\nhis shut-bed, and stood by his chest, and opened it, and drew out of\nit a fine hauberk of ring-mail which his father had made for him:\nfor though Face-of-god was a deft wright, he was not by a long way so\ndeft as his father, who was the deftest of all men of that time and\ncountry; so that the alien merchants would give him what he would for\nhis hauberks and helms, whenso he would chaffer with them, which was\nbut seldom.  So Face-of-god did on this hauberk over his kirtle, and\nover it he cast his foul-weather weed, so that none might see it:  he\ngirt a strong war-sword to his side, cast his quiver over his\nshoulder, and took his bow in his hand, although he had little lust\nto shoot elks that day, even as Stone-face had said; therewithal he\ntook his skids, and went forth of the hall to the gate of the Burg;\nwhereto gathered the whole company of twenty-three, and Gold-mane the\ntwenty-fourth.  And each man there had his skids and his bow and\nquiver, and whatso other weapon, as short-sword, or wood-knife, or\naxe, seemed good to him.\n\nSo they went out-a-gates, and clomb the stairway in the cliff which\nled to the ancient watch-tower:  for it was on the lower slopes of\nthe fells which lay near to the Weltering Water that they looked to\nfind the elks, and this was the nighest road thereto.  When they had\ngotten to the top they lost no time, but went their ways nearly due\neast, making way easily where there were but scattered trees close to\nthe lip of the sheer cliffs.\n\nThey went merrily on their skids over the close-lying snow, and were\nsoon up on the great shoulders of the fells that went up from the\nbank of the Weltering Water:  at noon they came into a little dale\nwherein were a few trees, and there they abided to eat their meat,\nand were very merry, making for themselves tables and benches of the\ndrifted snow, and piling it up to windward as a defence against the\nwind, which had now arisen, little but bitter from the south-east; so\nthat some, and they the wisest, began to look for foul weather:\nwherefore they tarried the shorter while in the said dale or hollow.\n\nBut they were scarcely on their way again before the aforesaid south-\neast wind began to grow bigger, and at last blew a gale, and brought\nup with it a drift of fine snow, through which they yet made their\nway, but slowly, till the drift grew so thick that they could not see\neach other five paces apart.\n\nThen perforce they made stay, and gathered together under a bent\nwhich by good luck they happened upon, where they were sheltered from\nthe worst of the drift.  There they abode, till in less than an\nhour's space the drift abated and the wind fell, and in a little\nwhile after it was quite clear, with the sun shining brightly and the\nyoung waxing moon white and high up in the heavens; and the frost was\nharder than ever.\n\nThis seemed good to them; but now that they could see each other's\nfaces they fell to telling over their company, and there was none\nmissing save Face-of-god.  They were somewhat dismayed thereat, but\nknew not what to do, and they deemed he might not be far off, either\na little behind or a little ahead; and Hall-face said:\n\n'There is no need to make this to-do about my brother; he can take\ngood care of himself; neither does a warrior of the Face die because\nof a little cold and frost and snow-drift.  Withal Gold-mane is a\nwilful man, and of late days hath been wilful beyond his wont; let us\nnow find the elks.'\n\nSo they went on their ways hoping to fall in with him again.  No long\nstory need be made of their hunting, for not very far from where they\nhad taken shelter they came upon the elks, many of them, impounded in\nthe drifts, pretty much where the deft hunters looked to find them.\nThere then was battle between the elks and the men, till the beasts\nwere all slain and only one man hurt:  then they made them sleighs\nfrom wood which they found in the hollows thereby, and they laid the\ncarcasses thereon, and so turned their faces homeward, dragging their\nprey with them.  But they met not Face-of-god either there or on the\nway home; and Hall-face said:  'Maybe Gold-mane will lie on the fell\nto-night; and I would I were with him; for adventures oft befall such\nfolk when they abide in the wilds.'\n\nNow it was late at night by then they reached Burgstead, so laden as\nthey were with the dead beasts; but they heeded the night little, for\nthe moon was well-nigh as bright as day for them.  But when they came\nto the gate of the Thorp, there were assembled the goodmen and swains\nto meet them with torches and wine in their honour.  There also was\nGold-mane come back before them, yea for these two hours; and he\nstood clad in his holiday raiment and smiled on them.\n\nThen was there some jeering at him that he was come back empty-handed\nfrom the hunting, and that he was not able to abide the wind and the\ndrift; but he laughed thereat, for all this was but game and play,\nsince men knew him for a keen hunter and a stout woodsman; and they\nhad deemed it a heavy loss of him if he had been cast away, as some\nfeared he had been:  and his brother Hall-face embraced him and\nkissed him, and said to him:  'Now the next time that thou farest to\nthe wood will I be with thee foot to foot, and never leave thee, and\nthen meseemeth I shall wot of the tale that hath befallen thee, and\nbelike it shall be no sorry one.'\n\nFace-of-god laughed and answered but little, and they all betook them\nto the House of the Face and held high feast therein, for as late as\nthe night was, in honour of this Hunting of the Elk.\n\nNo man cared to question Face-of-god closely as to how or where he\nhad strayed from the hunt; for he had told his own tale at once as\nsoon as he came home, to wit, that his right-foot skid-strap had\nbroken, and even while he stopped to mend it came on that drift and\nweather; and that he could not move from that place without losing\nhis way, and that when it had cleared he knew not whither they had\ngone because the snow had covered their slot.  So he deemed it not\nunlike that they had gone back, and that he might come up with one or\ntwo on the way, and that in any case he wotted well that they could\nlook after themselves; so he turned back, not going very swiftly.\nAll this seemed like enough, and a little matter except to jest\nabout, so no man made any question concerning it:  only old Stone-\nface said to himself:\n\n'Now were I fain to have a true tale out of him, but it is little\nlikely that anything shall come of my much questioning; and it is ill\nforcing a young man to tell lies.'\n\nSo he held his peace, and the feast went on merrily and blithely.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.  CONCERNING FACE-OF-GOD AND THE MOUNTAIN\n\n\n\nBut it must be told of Gold-mane that what had befallen him was in\nthis wise.  His skid-strap brake in good sooth, and he stayed to mend\nit; but when he had done what was needful, he looked up and saw no\nman nigh, what for the drift, and that they had gone on somewhat; so\nhe rose to his feet, and without more delay, instead of keeping on\ntoward the elk-ground and the way his face had been set, he turned\nhimself north-and-by-east, and went his ways swiftly towards that\nairt, because he deemed that it might lead him to the Mountain-hall\nwhere he had guested.  He abode not for the storm to clear, but swept\noff through the thick of it; and indeed the wind was somewhat at his\nback, so that he went the swiftlier.  But when the drift was gotten\nto its very worst, he sheltered himself for a little in a hollow\nbehind a thorn-bush he stumbled upon.  As soon as it began to abate\nhe went on again, and at last when it was quite clear, and the sun\nshone out, he found himself on a long slope of the fells covered deep\nwith smooth white snow, and at the higher end a great crag rising\nbare fifty feet above the snow, and more rocks, but none so great,\nand broken ground as he judged (the snow being deep) about it on the\nhither side; and on the further, three great pine-trees all bent down\nand mingled together by their load of snow.\n\nThitherward he made, as a man might, seeing nothing else to note\nbefore him; but he had not made many strides when forth from behind\nthe crag by the pine-trees came a man; and at first Face-of-god\nthought it might be one of his hunting-fellows gone astray, and he\nhailed him in a loud voice, but as he looked he saw the sun flash\nback from a bright helm on the new-comer's head; albeit he kept on\nhis way till there was but a space of two hundred yards between them;\nwhen lo! the helm-bearer notched a shaft to his bent bow and loosed\nat Face-of-god, and the arrow came whistling and passed six inches by\nhis right ear.  Then Face-of-god stopped perplexed with his case; for\nhe was on the deep snow in his skids, with his bow unbent, and he\nknew not how to bend it speedily.  He was loth to turn his back and\nflee, and indeed he scarce deemed that it would help him.  Meanwhile\nof his tarrying the archer loosed again at him, and this time the\nshaft flew close to his left ear.  Then Face-of-god thought to cast\nhimself down into the snow, but he was ashamed; till there came a\nthird shaft which flew over his head amidmost and close to it.  'Good\nshooting on the Mountain!' muttered he; 'the next shaft will be\namidst my breast, and who knows whether the Alderman's handiwork will\nkeep it out.'\n\nSo he cried aloud:  'Thou shootest well, brother; but art thou a foe?\nIf thou art, I have a sword by my side, and so hast thou; come hither\nto me, and let us fight it out friendly if we must needs fight.'\n\nA laugh came down the wind to him clear but somewhat shrill, and the\narcher came swiftly towards him on his skids with no weapon in his\nhand save his bow; so that Face-of-god did not draw his sword, but\nstood wondering.\n\nAs they drew nearer he beheld the face of the new-comer, and deemed\nthat he had seen it before; and soon, for all that it was hooded\nclose by the ill-weather raiment, he perceived it to be the face of\nBow-may, ruddy and smiling.\n\nShe laughed out loud again, as she stopped herself within three feet\nof him, and said:\n\n'Yea, friend Yellow-hair, we heard of the elks and looked to see thee\nhereabouts, and I knew thee at once when I came out from behind the\ncrag and saw thee stand bewildered.'\n\nSaid Gold-mane:  'Hail to thee, Bow-may! and glad am I to see thee.\nBut thou liest in saying that thou knewest me; else why didst thou\nshoot those three shafts at me?  Surely thou art not so quick as that\nwith all thy friends:  these be sharp greetings of you Mountain-\nfolk.'\n\n'Thou lad with the sweet mouth,' she said, 'I like to see thee and\nhear thee talk, but now must I hasten thy departure; so stand we here\nno longer.  Let us get down into the wood where we can do off our\nskids and sit down, and then will I tell thee the tidings.  Come on!'\n\nAnd she caught his hand in hers, and they went speedily down the\nslopes toward the great oak-wood, the wind whistling past their ears.\n\n'Whither are we going?' said he.\n\nSaid she:  'I am to show thee the way back home, which thou wilt not\nknow surely amidst this snow.  Come, no words! thou shalt not have my\ntale from me till we are in the wood:  so the sooner we are there the\nsooner shalt thou be pleased.'\n\nSo Face-of-god held his peace, and they went on swiftly side by side.\nBut it was not Bow-may's wont to be silent for long, so presently she\nsaid:\n\n'Thou art good so do as I bid thee; but see thou, sweet playmate, for\nall thou art a chieftain's son, thou wert but feather-brained to ask\nme why I shot at thee.  I shoot at thee! that were a fine tale to\ntell her this even!  Or dost thou think that I could shoot at a big\nman on the snow at two hundred paces and miss him three times?\nUnless I aimed to miss.'\n\n'Yea, Bow-may,' said he, 'art thou so deft a Bow-may?  Thou shalt be\nin my company whenso I fare to battle.'\n\n'Indeed,' she said, 'therein thou sayest but the bare truth:  nowhere\nelse shall I be, and thou shalt find my bow no worse than a good\nshield.'\n\nHe laughed somewhat lightly; but she looked on him soberly and said:\n'Laugh in that fashion on the day of battle, and we shall be well\ncontent with thee!'\n\nSo on they sped very swiftly, for their way was mostly down hill, so\nthat they were soon amongst the outskirting trees of the wood, and\npresently after reached the edge of the thicket, beyond which the\nground was but thinly covered with snow.\n\nThere they took off their skids, and went into the thick wood and sat\ndown under a hornbeam tree; and ere Gold-mane could open his mouth to\nspeak Bow-may began and said:\n\n'Well it was that I fell in with thee, Dalesman, else had there been\nmurders of men to tell of; but ever she ordereth all things wisely,\nthough unwisely hast thou done to seek to her.  Hearken! dost thou\nthink that thou hast done well that thou hast me here with my tale?\nWell, hadst thou busied thyself with the slaying of elks, or with\nsitting quietly at home, yet shouldest thou have heard my tale, and\nthou shouldest have seen me in Burgstead in a day or two to tell thee\nconcerning the flitting of the token.  And ill it is that I have\nmissed it, for fain had I been to behold the House of the Face, and\nto have seen thee sitting there in thy dignity amidst the kindred of\nchieftains.'\n\nAnd she sighed therewith.  But he said:  'Hold up thine heart, Bow-\nmay!  On the word of a true man that shall befall thee one day.  But\ncome, playmate, give me thy tale!'\n\n'Yea,' she said, 'I must now tell thee in the wild-wood what else I\nhad told thee in the Hall.  Hearken closely, for this is the message:\n\n'Seek not to me again till thou hast the token; else assuredly wilt\nthou be slain, and I shall be sorry for many a day.  Thereof as now I\nmay not tell thee more.  Now as to the token:  When March is worn two\nweeks fail not to go to and fro on the place of the Maiden Ward for\nan hour before sunrise every day till thou hear tidings.'\n\n'Now,' quoth Bow-may, 'hast thou hearkened and understood?'\n\n'Yea,' said he.\n\nShe said:  'Then tell me the words of my message concerning the\ntoken.'  And he did so word for word.  Then she said:\n\n'It is well, there is no more to say.  Now must I lead thee till thou\nknowest the wood; and then mayst thou get on to the smooth snow\nagain, and so home merrily.  Yet, thou grey-eyed fellow, I will have\nmy pay of thee before I do that last work.'\n\nTherewith she turned about to him and took his head between her\nhands, and kissed him well favouredly both cheeks and mouth; and she\nlaughed, albeit the tears stood in her eyes as she said:  'Now\nsmelleth the wood sweeter, and summer will come back again.  And even\nthus will I do once more when we stand side by side in battle array.'\n\nHe smiled kindly on her and nodded as they both rose up from the\nearth:  she had taken off her foul-weather gloves while they spake,\nand he kissed her hand, which was shapely of fashion albeit somewhat\nbrown, and hard of palm, and he said in friendly wise:\n\n'Thou art a merry faring-fellow, Bow-may, and belike shalt be withal\na true fighting-fellow.  Come now, thou shalt be my sister and I thy\nbrother, in despite of those three shafts across the snow.'\n\nHe laughed therewith; she laughed not, but seemed glad, and said\nsoberly:\n\n'Yea, I may well be thy sister; for belike I also am of the people of\nthe Gods, who have come into these Dales by many far ways.  I am of\nthe House of the Ragged Sword of the Kindred of the Wolf.  Come,\nbrother, let us toward Wildlake's Way.'\n\nTherewith she went before him and led through the thicket as by an\nassured and wonted path, and he followed hard at heel; but his\nthought went from her for a while; for those words of brother and\nsister that he had spoken called to his mind the Bride, and their\nkindness of little children, and the days when they seemed to have\nnought to do but to make the sun brighter, and the flowers fairer,\nand the grass greener, and the birds happier each for the other; and\na hard and evil thing it seemed to him that now he should be making\nall these things nought and dreary to her, now when he had become a\nman and deeds lay before him.  Yet again was he solaced by what Bow-\nmay had said concerning battle to come; for he deemed that she must\nhave had this from the Friend's foreseeing; and he longed sore for\ndeeds to do, wherein all these things might be cleared up and washen\nclean as it were.\n\nSo passed they through the wood a long way, and it was getting dark\ntherein, and Gold-mane said:\n\n'Hold now, Bow-may, for I am at home here.'\n\nShe looked around and said:  'Yea, so it is:  I was thinking of many\nthings.  Farewell and live merrily till March comes and the token!'\n\nTherewith she turned and went her ways and was soon out of sight, and\nhe went lightly through the wood, and then on skids over the hard\nsnow along the Dale's edge till he was come to the watch-tower, when\nthe moon was bright in heaven.\n\nThus was he at Burgstead and the House of the Face betimes, and\nbefore the hunters were gotten back.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.  MURDER AMONGST THE FOLK OF THE WOODLANDERS\n\n\n\nSo wore away midwinter tidingless.  Stone-face spake no more to Face-\nof-god about the wood and its wights, when he saw that the young man\nhad come back hale and merry, seemed not to crave over-much to go\nback thither.  As for the Bride, she was sad, and more than\nmisdoubted all; but dauntless as she was in matters that try men's\nhardihood, she yet lacked heart to ask of Face-of-god what had\nbefallen him since the autumn-tide, or where he was with her.  So she\nput a force upon herself not to look sad or craving when she was in\nhis company, as full oft she was; for he rather sought her than\nshunned her.  For when he saw her thus, he deemed things were\nchanging with her as they had changed with him, and he bethought him\nof what he had spoken to Bow-may, and deemed that even so he might\nspeak with the Bride when the time came, and that she would not be\ngrieved beyond measure, and all would be well.\n\nNow came on the thaw, and the snow went, and the grass grew all up\nand down the Dale, and all waters were big.  And about this time\narose rumours of strange men in the wood, uncouth, vile, and\nmurderous, and many of the feebler sort were made timorous thereby.\n\nBut a little before March was born came new tidings from the\nWoodlanders; to wit:  There came on a time to the house of a woodland\ncarle, a worthy goodman well renowned of all, two wayfarers in the\nfirst watch of the night; and these men said that they were wending\ndown to the Plain from a far-away dale, Rose-dale to wit, which all\nmen had heard of, and that they had strayed from the way and were\nexceeding weary, and they craved a meal's meat and lodging for the\nnight.\n\nThis the goodman might nowise gainsay, and he saw no harm in it,\nwherefore he bade them abide and be merry.\n\nThese men, said they who told the tidings, were outlanders, and no\nman had seen any like them before:  they were armed, and bore short\nbows made of horn, and round targets, and coats-of-fence done over\nwith horn scales; they had crooked swords girt to their sides, and\naxes of steel forged all in one piece, right good weapons.  They were\nclad in scarlet and had much silver on their raiment and about their\nweapons, and great rings of the same on their arms; and all this\nsilver seemed brand-new.\n\nNow the Woodland Carle gave them of such things as he had, and was\nkind and blithe to them:  there were in his house besides himself\nfive men of his sons and kindred, and his wife and three daughters\nand two other maids.  So they feasted after the Woodlanders' fashion,\nand went to bed a little before midnight.  Two hours after, the carle\nawoke and heard a little stir, and he looked and saw the guests on\ntheir feet amidst the hall clad in all their war-gear; and they had\nbetwixt them his two youngest daughters, maids of fifteen and twelve\nwinters, and had bound their hands and done clouts over their mouths,\nso that they might not cry out; and they were just at point to carry\nthem off.  Thereat the goodman, naked as he was, caught up his sword\nand made at these murder-carles, and or ever they were ware of him he\nhad hewn down one and turned to face the other, who smote at him with\nhis steel axe and gave him a great wound on the shoulder, and\ntherewithal fled out at the open door and forth into the wood.\n\nThe Woodlander made no stay to raise the cry (there was no need, for\nthe hall was astir now from end to end, and men getting to their\nweapons), but ran out after the felon even as he was; and, in spite\nof his grievous hurt, overran him no long way from the house before\nhe had gotten into the thicket.  But the man was nimble and strong,\nand the goodman unsteady from his wound, and by then the others of\nthe household came up with the hue and cry he had gotten two more\nsore wounds and was just making an end of throttling the felon with\nhis bare hands.  So he fell into their arms fainting from weakness,\nand for all they could do he died in two hours' time from that axe-\nwound in his shoulder, and another on the side of the head, and a\nknife-thrust in his side; and he was a man of sixty winters.\n\nBut the stranger he had slain outright; and the one whom he had\nsmitten in the hall died before the dawn, thrusting all help aside,\nand making no sound of speech.\n\nWhen these tidings came to Burgstead they seemed great to men, and to\nGold-mane more than all.  So he and many others took their weapons\nand fared up to Wildlake's Way, and so came to the Woodland Carles.\nBut the Woodlanders had borne out the carcasses of those felons and\nlaid them on the green before Wood-grey's door (for that was the name\nof the dead goodman), and they were saying that they would not bury\nsuch accursed folk, but would bear them a little way so that they\nshould not be vexed with the stink of them, and cast them into the\nthicket for the wolf and the wild-cat and the stoat to deal with; and\nthey should lie there, weapons and silver and all; and they deemed it\nbase to strip such wretches, for who would wear their raiment or bear\ntheir weapons after them.\n\nThere was a great ring of folk round about them when they of\nBurgstead drew near, and they shouted for joy to see their\nneighbours, and made way before them.  Then the Dalesmen cursed these\nmurderers who had slain so good a man, and they all praised his\nmanliness, whereas he ran out into the night naked and wounded after\nhis foe, and had fallen like his folk of old time.\n\nIt was a bright spring afternoon in that clearing of the Wood, and\nthey looked at the two dead men closely; and Gold-mane, who had been\nsomewhat silent and moody till then, became merry and wordy; for he\nbeheld the men and saw that they were utterly strange to him:  they\nwere short of stature, crooked-legged, long-armed, very strong for\ntheir size:  with small blue eyes, snubbed-nosed, wide-mouthed, thin-\nlipped, very swarthy of skin, exceeding foul of favour.  He and all\nothers wondered who they were, and whence they came, for never had\nthey seen their like; and the Woodlanders, who often guested\noutlanders strayed from the way of divers kindreds and nations, said\nalso that none such had they ever seen.  But Stone-face, who stood by\nGold-mane, shook his head and quoth he:\n\n'The Wild-wood holdeth many marvels, and these be of them:  the spawn\nof evil wights quickeneth therein, and at other whiles it melteth\naway again like the snow; so may it be with these carcasses.'\n\nAnd some of the older folk of the Woodlanders who stood by hearkened\nwhat he said, and deemed his words wise, for they remembered their\nancient lore and many a tale of old time.\n\nThereafter they of Burgstead went into Wood-grey's hall, or as many\nof them as might, for it was but a poor place and not right great.\nThere they saw the goodman laid on the dais in all his war-gear,\nunder the last tie-beam of his hall, whereon was carved amidst much\ngoodly work of knots and flowers and twining stems the image of the\nWolf of the Waste, his jaws open and gaping:  the wife and daughters\nof the goodman and other women of the folk stood about the bier\nsinging some old song in a low voice, and some sobbing therewithal,\nfor the man was much beloved:  and much people of the Woodlanders was\nin the hall, and it was somewhat dusk within.\n\nSo the Burgstead men greeted that folk kindly and humbly, and again\nthey fell to praising the dead man, saying how his deed should long\nbe remembered in the Dale and wide about; and they called him a\nfearless man and of great worth.  And the women hearkened, and ceased\ntheir crooning and their sobbing, and stood up proudly and raised\ntheir heads with gleaming eyes; and as the words of the Burgstead men\nended, they lifted up their voices and sang loudly and clearly,\nstanding together in a row, ten of them, on the dais of that poor\nhall, facing the gable and the wolf-adorned tie-beam, heeding nought\nas they sang what was about or behind them.\n\nAnd this is some of what they sang:\n\n\nWhy sit ye bare in the spinning-room?\nWhy weave ye naked at the loom?\n\nBare and white as the moon we be,\nThat the Earth and the drifting night may see.\n\nNow what is the worst of all your work?\nWhat curse amidst the web shall lurk?\n\nThe worst of the work our hands shall win\nIs wrack and ruin round the kin.\n\nShall the woollen yarn and the flaxen thread\nBe gear for living men or dead?\n\nThe woollen yarn and the flaxen thread\nShall flare 'twixt living men and dead.\n\nO what is the ending of your day?\nWhen shall ye rise and wend away?\n\nOur day shall end to-morrow morn,\nWhen we hear the voice of the battle-horn.\n\nWhere first shall eyes of men behold\nThis weaving of the moonlight cold?\n\nThere where the alien host abides\nThe gathering on the Mountain-sides.\n\nHow long aloft shall the fair web fly\nWhen the bows are bent and the spears draw nigh?\n\nFrom eve to morn and morn till eve\nAloft shall fly the work we weave.\n\nWhat then is this, the web ye win?\nWhat wood-beast waxeth stark therein?\n\nWe weave the Wolf and the gift of war\nFrom the men that were to the men that are.\n\n\nSo sang they:  and much were all men moved at their singing, and\nthere was none but called to mind the old days of the Fathers, and\nthe years when their banner went wide in the world.\n\nBut the Woodlanders feasted them of Burgstead what they might, and\nthen went the Dalesmen back to their houses; but on the morrow's\nmorrow they fared thither again, and Wood-grey was laid in mound\namidst a great assemblage of the Folk.\n\nMany men said that there was no doubt that those two felons were of\nthe company of those who had ransacked the steads of Penny-thumb and\nHarts-bane; and so at first deemed Bristler the son of Brightling:\nbut after a while, when he had had time to think of it, he changed\nhis mind; for he said that such men as these would have slain first\nand ransacked afterwards:  and some who loved neither Penny-thumb nor\nHarts-bane said that they would not have been at the pains to choose\nfor ransacking the two worst men about the Dale, whose loss was no\nloss to any but themselves.\n\nAs for Gold-mane he knew not what to think, except that his friends\nof the Mountain had had nought to do with it.\n\nSo wore the days awhile.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.  THE BRIDE SPEAKETH WITH FACE-OF-GOD\n\n\n\nFebruary had died into March, and March was now twelve days old, on a\nfair and sunny day an hour before noon; and Face-of-god was in a\nmeadow a scant mile down the Dale from Burgstead.  He had been\ndriving a bull into a goodman's byre nearby, and had had to spend\ntoil and patience both in getting him out of the fields and into the\nbyre; for the beast was hot with the spring days and the new grass.\nSo now he was resting himself in happy mood in an exceeding pleasant\nplace, a little meadow to wit, on one side whereof was a great\norchard or grove of sweet chestnuts, which went right up to the feet\nof the Southern Cliffs:  across the meadow ran a clear brook towards\nthe Weltering Water, free from big stones, in some places dammed up\nfor the flooding of the deep pasture-meadow, and with the grass\ngrowing on its lips down to the very water.  There was a low bank\njust outside the chestnut trees, as if someone had raised a dyke\nabout them when they were young, which had been trodden low and\nspreading through the lapse of years by the faring of many men and\nbeasts.  The primroses bloomed thick upon it now, and here and there\nalong it was a low blackthorn bush in full blossom; from the mid-\nmeadow and right down to the lip of the brook was the grass well nigh\nhidden by the blossoms of the meadow-saffron, with daffodils\nsprinkled about amongst them, and in the trees and bushes the birds,\nand chiefly the blackbirds, were singing their loudest.\n\nThere sat Face-of-god on the bank resting after his toil, and happy\nwas his mood; since in two days' wearing he should be pacing the\nMaiden Ward awaiting the token that was to lead him to Shadowy Vale;\nso he sat calling to mind the Friend as he had last seen her, and\nstriving as it were to set her image standing on the flowery grass\nbefore him, till all the beauty of the meadow seemed bare and empty\nto him without her.  Then it fell into his mind that this had been a\nbeloved trysting-place betwixt him and the Bride, and that often when\nthey were little would they come to gather chestnuts in the grove,\nand thereafter sit and prattle on the old dyke; or in spring when the\nseason was warm would they go barefoot into the brook, seeking its\ntreasures of troutlets and flowers and clean-washed agate pebbles.\nYea, and time not long ago had they met here to talk as lovers, and\nsat on that very bank in all the kindness of good days without a\nblemish, and both he and she had loved the place well for its wealth\nof blossoms and deep grass and goodly trees and clear running stream.\n\nAs he thought of all this, and how often there he had praised to\nhimself her beauty, which he scarce dared praise to her, he frowned\nand slowly rose to his feet, and turned toward the chestnut-grove, as\nthough he would go thence that way; but or ever he stepped down from\nthe dyke he turned about again, and even therewith, like the very\nimage and ghost of his thought, lo! the Bride herself coming up from\nout the brook and wending toward him, her wet naked feet gleaming in\nthe sun as they trod down the tender meadow-saffron and brushed past\nthe tufts of daffodils.  He stood staring at her discomforted, for on\nthat day he had much to think of that seemed happy to him, and he\ndeemed that she would now question him, and his mind pondered divers\nways of answering her, and none seemed good to him.  She drew near\nand let her skirts fall over her feet, and came to him, her gown hem\ndragging over the flowers:  then she stood straight up before him and\ngreeted him, but reached not forth her hand to him nor touched him.\nHer face was paler that its wont, and her voice trembled as she spake\nto him and said:\n\n'Face-of-god, I would ask thee a gift.'\n\n'All gifts,' he said, 'that thou mayest ask, and I may give, lie open\nto thee.'\n\nShe said:  'If I be alive when the time comes this gift thou mayst\nwell give me.'\n\n'Sweet kinswoman,' said he, 'tell me what it is that thou wouldest\nhave of me.'  And he was ill-at-ease as he waited for her answer.\n\nShe said:  'Ah, kinsman, kinsman!  Woe on the day that maketh kinship\naccursed to me because thou desirest it!'\n\nHe held his peace and was exceeding sorry; and she said:\n\n'This is the gift that I ask of thee, that in the days to come when\nthou art wedded, thou wilt give me the second man-child whom thou\nbegettest.'\n\nHe said:  'This shalt thou have, and would that I might give thee\nmuch more.  Would that we were little children together other again,\nas when we played here in other days.'\n\nShe said:  'I would have a token of thee that thou shalt show to the\nGod, and swear on it to give me the gift.  For the times change.'\n\n'What token wilt thou have?' said he.\n\nShe said:  'When next thou farest to the Wood, thou shalt bring me\nback, it maybe a flower from the bank ye sit upon, or a splinter from\nthe dais of the hall wherein ye feast, or maybe a ring or some matter\nthat the strangers are wont to wear.  That shall be the token.'\n\nShe spoke slowly, hanging her head adown, but she lifted it presently\nand looked into his face and said:\n\n'Woe's me, woe's me, Gold-mane!  How evil is this day, when bewailing\nme I may not bewail thee also!  For I know that thine heart is glad.\nAll through the winter have I kept this hidden in my heart, and durst\nnot speak to thee.  But now the spring-tide hath driven me to it.\nLet summer come, and who shall say?'\n\nGreat was his grief, and his shame kept him silent, and he had no\nword to say; and again she said:\n\n'Tell me, Gold-mane, when goest thou thither?'\n\nHe said:  'I know not surely, may happen in two days, may happen in\nten.  Why askest thou?'\n\n'O friend!' she said, 'is it a new thing that I should ask thee\nwhither thou goest and whence thou comest, and the times of thy\ncoming and going.  Farewell to-day!  Forget not the token.  Woe's me,\nthat I may not kiss thy fair face!'\n\nShe spread her arms abroad and lifted up her face as one who waileth,\nbut no sound came from her lips; then she turned about and went away\nas she had come.\n\nBut as for him he stood there after she was gone in all confusion, as\nif he were undone:  for he felt his manhood lessened that he should\nthus and so sorely have hurt a friend, and in a manner against his\nwill.  And yet he was somewhat wroth with her, that she had come upon\nhim so suddenly, and spoken to him with such mastery, and in so few\nwords, and he with none to make answer to her, and that she had so\nmarred his pleasure and his hope of that fair day.  Then he sat him\ndown again on the flowery bank, and little by little his heart\nsoftened, and he once more called to mind many a time when they had\nbeen there before, and the plays and the games they had had together\nthere when they were little.  And he bethought him of the days that\nwere long to him then, and now seemed short to him, and as if they\nwere all grown together into one story, and that a sweet one.  Then\nhis breast heaved with a sob, and the tears rose to his eyes and\nburned and stung him, and he fell a-weeping for that sweet tale, and\nwept as he had wept once before on that old dyke when there had been\nsome child's quarrel between them, and she had gone away and left\nhim.\n\nThen after a while he ceased his weeping, and looked about him lest\nanyone might be coming, and then he arose and went to and fro in the\nchestnut-grove for a good while, and afterwards went his ways from\nthat meadow, saying to himself:  'Yet remaineth to me the morrow of\nto-morrow, and that is the first of the days of the watching for the\ntoken.'\n\nBut all that day he was slow to meet the eyes of men; and in the hall\nthat eve he was silent and moody; for from time to time it came over\nhim that some of his manhood had departed from him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.  THE TOKEN COMETH FROM THE MOUNTAIN\n\n\n\nThe next day wore away tidingless; and the day after Face-of-god\narose betimes; for it was the first day of his watch, and he was at\nthe Maiden Ward before the time appointed on a very fair and bright\nmorning, and he went to and fro on that place, and had no tidings.\nSo he came away somewhat cast down, and said within himself:  'Is it\nbut a lie and a mocking when all is said?'\n\nOn the morrow he went thither again, and the morn was wild and stormy\nwith drift of rain, and low clouds hurrying over the earth, though\nfor the sunrise they lifted a little in the east, and the sun came up\nover the passes, amidst the red and angry rack of clouds.  This morn\nalso gave him no tidings of the token, and he was wroth and perturbed\nin spirit:  but towards evening he said:\n\n'It is well:  ten days she gave me, so that she might be able to send\nwithout fail on one of them; she will not fail me.'\n\nSo again on the morrow he was there betimes, and the morn was windy\nas on the day before, but the clouds higher and of better promise for\nthe day.  Face-of-god walked to and fro on the Maiden Ward, and as he\nturned toward Burgstead for the tenth time, he heard, as he deemed, a\nbow-string twang afar off, and even therewith came a shaft flying\nheavily like a winged bird, which smote a great standing stone on the\nother side of the way, where of old some chieftain had been buried,\nand fell to earth at its foot.  He went up to it and handled it, and\nsaw that there was a piece of thin parchment wrapped about it, which\nindeed he was eager to unwrap at once, but forebore; because he was\non the highway, and people were already astir, and even then passed\nby him a goodman of the Dale with a man of his going afield together,\nand they gave him the sele of the day.  So he went along the highway\na little till he came to a place where was a footbridge over into the\nmeadow.  He crossed thereby and went swiftly till he reached a rising\nground grown over with hazel-trees; there he sat down among the\nrabbit-holes, the primrose and wild-garlic blooming about him, and\nthree blackbirds answering one another from the edges of the coppice.\nStraightway when he had looked and seen none coming he broke the\nthreads that were wound about the scroll and the arrow, and unrolled\nthe parchment; and there was writing thereon in black ink of small\nletters, but very fair, and this is what he read therein:\n\n\nCome thou to the Mountain Hall by the path which thou knowest of, on\nthe morrow of the day whereon thou readest this.  Rise betimes and\ncome armed, for there are other men than we in the wood; to whom thy\ndeath should be a gain.  When thou art come to the Hall, thou shalt\nfind no man therein; but a great hound only, tied to a bench nigh the\ndais.  Call him by his name, Sure-foot to wit, and give him to eat\nfrom the meat upon the board, and give him water to drink.  If the\nday is then far spent, as it is like to be, abide thou with the hound\nin the hall through the night, and eat of what thou shalt find there;\nbut see that the hound fares not abroad till the morrow's morn:  then\nlead him out and bring him to the north-east corner of the Hall, and\nhe shall lift the slot for thee that leadeth to the Shadowy Yale.\nFollow him and all good go with thee.\n\n\nNow when he had read this, earth seemed fair indeed about him, and he\nscarce knew whither to turn or what to do to make the most of his\njoy.  He presently went back to Burgstead and into the House of the\nFace, where all men were astir now, and the day was clearing.  He hid\nthe shaft under his kirtle, for he would not that any should see it;\nso he went to his shut-bed and laid it up in his chest, wherein he\nkept his chiefest treasures; but the writing on the scroll he set in\nhis bosom and so hid it.  He went joyfully and proudly, as one who\nknoweth more tidings and better than those around him.  But Stone-\nface beheld him, and said 'Foster-son, thou art happy.  Is it that\nthe spring-tide is in thy blood, and maketh thee blithe with all\nthings, or hast thou some new tidings?  Nay, I would not have an\nanswer out of thee; but here is good rede:  when next thou goest into\nthe wood, it were nought so ill for thee to have a valiant old carle\nby thy side; one that loveth thee, and would die for thee if need\nwere; one who might watch when thou wert seeking.  Or else beware!\nfor there are evil things abroad in the Wood, and moreover the\nbrethren of those two felons who were slain at Carlstead.'\n\nThen Gold-mane constrained himself to answer the old carle softly;\nand he thanked him kindly for his offer, and said that so it should\nbe before long.  So the talk between them fell, and Stone-face went\naway somewhat well-pleased.\n\nAnd now was Face-of-god become wary; and he would not draw men's eyes\nand speech on him; so he went afield with Hall-face to deal with the\nlambs and the ewes, and did like other men.  No less wary was he in\nthe hall that even, and neither spake much nor little; and when his\nfather spake to him concerning the Bride, and made game of him as a\nsomewhat sluggish groom, he did not change countenance, but answered\nlightly what came to hand.\n\nOn the morrow ere the earliest dawn he was afoot, and he clad himself\nand did on his hauberk, his father's work, which was fine-wrought and\na stout defence, and reached down to his knees; and over that he did\non a goodly green kirtle well embroidered:  he girt his war-sword to\nhis side, and it was the work of his father's father, and a very good\nsword:  its name was Dale-warden.  He did a good helm on his head,\nand slung a targe at his back, and took two spears in his hand, short\nbut strong-shafted and well-steeled.  Thus arrayed he left Burgstead\nbefore the dawn, and came to Wildlake's Way and betook him to the\nWoodland.  He made no stop or stay on the path, but ate his meat\nstanding by an oak-tree close by the half-blind track.  When he came\nto the little wood-lawn, where was the toft of the ancient house, he\nlooked all round about him, for he deemed that a likely place for\nthose ugly wood-wights to set on him; but nought befell him, though\nhe stooped and drank of the woodland rill warily enough.  So he\npassed on; and there were other places also where he fared warily,\nbecause they seemed like to hold lurking felons; though forsooth the\nwhole wood might well serve their turn.  But no evil befell him, and\nat last, when it yet lacked an hour to sunset, he came to the wood-\nlawn where Wild-wearer had made his onset that other eve.\n\nHe went straight up to the house, his heart beating, and he scarce\nbelieving but that he should find the Friend abiding him there:  but\nwhen he pushed the door it gave way before him at once, and he\nentered and found no man therein, and the walls stripped bare and no\nshield or weapon hanging on the panels.  But the hound he saw tied to\na bench nigh the dais, and the bristles on the beast's neck arose,\nand he snarled on Face-of-god, and strained on his leathern leash.\nThen Face-of-god went up to him and called him by his name, Sure-\nfoot, and gave him his hand to lick, and he brought him water, and\nfed him with flesh from the meat on the board; so the beast became\nfriendly and wagged his tail and whined and slobbered his hand.\n\nThen he went all about the house, and saw and heard no living thing\ntherein save the mice in the panels and Sure-foot.  So he came back\nto the dais, and sat him down at the board and ate his fill, and\nthought concerning his case.  And it came into his mind that the\nWoman of the Mountain had some deed for him to do which would try his\nmanliness and exalt his fame; and his heart rose high and he was\nglad, and he saw himself sitting beside her on the dais of a very\nfair hall beloved and honoured of all the folk, and none had aught to\nsay against him or owed him any grudge.  Thus he pleased himself in\nthinking of the good days to come, sitting there till the hall grew\ndusk and dark and the night-wind moaned about it.\n\nThen after a while he arose and raked together the brands on the\nhearth, and made light in the hall and looked to the door.  And he\nfound there were bolts and bars thereto, so he shot the bolts and\ndrew the bars into their places and made all as sure as might be.\nThen he brought Sure-foot down from the dais, and tied him up so that\nhe might lie down athwart the door, and then lay down his hauberk\nwith his naked sword ready to his hand, and slept long while.\n\nWhen he awoke it was darker than when he had lain him for the moon\nhad set; yet he deemed that the day was at point of breaking.  So he\nfetched water and washed the night off him, and saw a little glimmer\nof the dawn.  Then he ate somewhat of the meat on the board, and did\non his helm and his other gear, and unbarred the door, and led Sure-\nfoot without, and brought him to the north-east corner of the house,\nand in a little while he lifted the slot and they departed, the man\nand the hound, just as broke dawn from over the mountains.\n\nSure-foot led right into the heart of the pine-wood, and it was dark\nenough therein, with nought but a feeble glimmer for some while, and\nlong was the way therethrough; but in two hours' space was there\nsomething of a break, and they came to the shore of a dark deep tarn\non whose windless and green waters the daylight shone fully.  The\nhound skirted the water, and led on unchecked till the trees began to\ngrow smaller and the air colder for all that the sun was higher; for\nthey had been going up and up all the way.\n\nSo at last after a six hours' journey they came clean out of the\npine-wood, and before them lay the black wilderness of the bare\nmountains, and beyond them, looking quite near now, the great ice-\npeaks, the wall of the world.  It was but an hour short of noon by\nthis time, and the high sun shone down on a barren boggy moss which\nlay betwixt them and the rocky waste.  Sure-foot made no stay, but\nthreaded the ways that went betwixt the quagmires, and in another\nhour led Face-of-god into a winding valley blinded by great rocks,\nand everywhere stony and rough, with a trickle of water running\namidst of it.  The hound fared on up the dale to where the water was\nbridged by a great fallen stone, and so over it and up a steep bent\non the further side, on to a marvellously rough mountain-neck, whiles\nmere black sand cumbered with scattered rocks and stones, whiles\nbeset with mires grown over with the cottony mire-grass; here and\nthere a little scanty grass growing; otherwhere nought but dwarf\nwillow ever dying ever growing, mingled with moss or red-blossomed\nsengreen; and all blending together into mere desolation.\n\nFew living things they saw there; up on the neck a few sheep were\ngrazing the scanty grass, but there was none to tend them; yet Face-\nof-god deemed the sight of them good, for there must be men anigh who\nowned them.  For the rest, the whimbrel laughed across the mires;\nhigh up in heaven a great eagle was hanging; once and again a grey\nfox leapt up before them, and the heath-fowl whirred up from under\nFace-of-god's feet.  A raven who was sitting croaking on a rock in\nthat first dale stirred uneasily on his perch as he saw them, and\nwhen they were passed flapped his wings and flew after them croaking\nstill.\n\nNow they fared over that neck somewhat east, making but slow way\nbecause the ground was so broken and rocky; and in another hour's\nspace Sure-foot led down-hill due east to where the stony neck sank\ninto another desolate miry heath still falling toward the east, but\nwhose further side was walled by a rampart of crags cleft at their\ntops into marvellous-shapes, coal-black, ungrassed and unmossed.\nThitherward the hound led straight, and Gold-mane followed wondering:\nas he drew near them he saw that they were not very high, the tallest\npeak scant fifty feet from the face of the heath.\n\nThey made their way through the scattered rocks at the foot of these\ncrags, till, just where the rock-wall seemed the closest, the way\nthrough the stones turned into a path going through it skew-wise; and\nit was now so clear a path that belike it had been bettered by men's\nhands.  Down thereby Face-of-god followed the hound, deeming that he\nwas come to the gates of the Shadowy Vale, and the path went down\nsteeply and swiftly.  But when he had gone down a while, the rocks on\nhis right hand sank lower for a space, so that he could look over and\nsee what lay beneath.\n\nThere lay below him a long narrow vale quite plain at the bottom,\nwalled on the further side as on the hither by sheer rocks of black\nstone.  The plain was grown over with grass, but he could see no tree\ntherein:  a deep river, dark and green, ran through the vale,\nsometimes through its midmost, sometimes lapping the further rock-\nwall:  and he thought indeed that on many a day in the year the sun\nwould never shine on that valley.\n\nThus much he saw, and then the rocks rose again and shut it from his\nsight; and at last they drew so close together over head that he was\nin a way going through a cave with little daylight coming from above,\nand in the end he was in a cave indeed and mere darkness:  but with\nthe last feeble glimmer of light he thought he saw carved on a smooth\nspace of the living rock at his left hand the image of a wolf.\n\nThis cave lasted but a little way, and soon the hound and the man\nwere going once more between sheer black rocks, and the path grew\nsteeper yet and was cut into steps.  At last there was a sharp turn,\nand they stood on the top of a long stony scree, down which Sure-foot\nbounded eagerly, giving tongue as he went; but Face-of-god stood\nstill and looked, for now the whole Dale lay open before him.\n\nThat river ran from north to south, and at the south end the cliffs\ndrew so close to it that looking thence no outgate could be seen; but\nat the north end there was as it were a dreary street of rocks, the\nriver flowing amidmost and leaving little foothold on either side,\nsomewhat as it was with the pass leading from the mountains into\nBurgdale.\n\nAmidmost of the Dale a little toward the north end he saw a doom-ring\nof black stones, and hard by it an ancient hall builded of the same\nblack stone both wall and roof, and thitherward was Sure-foot now\nrunning.  Face-of-god looked up and down the Dale and could see no\nbreak in the wall of sheer rock:  toward the southern end he saw a\nfew booths and cots built roughly of stone and thatched with turf;\nthereabout he saw a few folk moving about, the most of whom seemed to\nbe women and children; there were some sheep and lambs near these\ncots, and a herd of fifty or so of somewhat goodly mountain-kine were\nfeeding higher up the valley.  He could look down into the river from\nwhere he stood, and he saw that it ran between rocky banks going\nstraight down from the face of the meadow, which was rather high\nabove the water, so that it seemed little likely that the water\nshould rise over its banks, either in summer or winter; and in summer\nwas it like to be highest, because the vale was so near to the high\nmountains and their snows.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.  FACE-OF-GOD TALKETH WITH THE FRIEND IN SHADOWY VALE\n\n\n\nIt was now about two hours after noon, and a broad band of sunlight\nlay upon the grass of the vale below Gold-mane's feet; he went\nlightly down the scree, and strode forward over the level grass\ntoward the Doom-ring, his helm and war-gear glittering bright in the\nsun.  He must needs go through the Doom-ring to come to the Hall, and\nas he stepped out from behind the last of the big upright-stones, he\nsaw a woman standing on the threshold of the Hall-door, which was but\nsome score of paces from him, and knew her at once for the Friend.\n\nShe was clad like himself in a green kirtle gaily embroidered and\nfitting close to her body, and had no gown or cloak over it; she had\na golden fillet on her head beset with blue mountain stones, and her\nhair hung loose behind her.\n\nHer beauty was so exceeding, and so far beyond all memory of her that\nhis mind had held, that once more fear of her fell upon Face-of-god,\nand he stood still with beating heart till she should speak to him.\nBut she came forward swiftly with both her hands held out, smiling\nand happy-faced, and looking very kindly on him, and she took his\nhands and said to him:\n\n'Now welcome, Gold-mane, welcome, Face-of-god! and twice welcome art\nthou and threefold.  Lo! this is the day that thou asked for:  art\nthou happy in it?'\n\nHe lifted her hands to his lips and kissed them timorously, but said\nnought; and therewithal Sure-foot came running forth from the Hall,\nand fell to bounding round about them, barking noisily after the\nmanner of dogs who have met their masters again; and still she held\nhis hands and beheld him kindly.  Then she called the hound to her,\nand patted him on the neck and quieted him, and then turned to Face-\nof-god and laughed happily and said:\n\n'I do not bid thee hold thy peace; yet thou sayest nought.  Is well\nwith thee?'\n\n'Yea,' he said, 'and more than well.'\n\n'Thou seemest to me a goodly warrior,' she said; 'hast thou met any\nfoemen yesterday or this morning?'\n\n'Nay,' said he, 'none hindered me; thou hast made the ways easy to\nme.'\n\nShe said soberly, 'Such as I might do, I did.  But we may not wield\neverything, for our foes are many, and I feared for thee.  But come\nthou into our house, which is ours, and far more ours than the booth\nbefore the pine-wood.'\n\nShe took his hand again and led him toward the door, but Face-of-god\nlooked up, and above the lintel he saw carved on the dark stone that\nimage of the Wolf, even as he had seen it carved on Wood-grey's tie-\nbeam; and therewith such thoughts came into his mind that he stopped\nto look, pressing the Friend's hand hard as though bidding her note\nit.  The stone wherein the image was carved was darker than the other\nbuilding stones, and might be called black; the jaws of the wood-\nbeast were open and gaping, and had been painted with cinnabar, but\nwind and weather had worn away the most of the colour.\n\nSpake the Friend:  'So it is:  thou beholdest the token of the God\nand Father of out Fathers, that telleth the tale of so many days,\nthat the days which now pass by us be to them but as the drop in the\nsea of waters.  Thou beholdest the sign of our sorrow, the memory of\nour wrong; yet is it also the token of our hope.  Maybe it shall lead\nthee far.'\n\n'Whither?' said he.  But she answered not a great while, and he\nlooked at her as she stood a-gazing on the image, and saw how the\ntears stole out of her eyes and ran adown her cheeks.  Then again\ncame the thought to him of Wood-grey's hall, and the women of the\nkindred standing before the Wolf and singing of him; and though there\nwas little comeliness in them and she was so exceeding beauteous, he\ncould not but deem that they were akin to her.\n\nBut after a while she wiped the tears from her face and turned to him\nand said:  'My friend, the Wolf shall lead thee no-whither but where\nI also shall be, whatsoever peril or grief may beset the road or lurk\nat the ending thereof.  Thou shalt be no thrall, to labour while I\nlook on.'\n\nHis heart swelled within him as she spoke, and he was at point to\nbeseech her love that moment; but now her face had grown gay and\nbright again, and she said while he was gathering words to speak\nwithal:\n\n'Come in, Gold-mane, come into our house; for I have many things to\nsay to thee.  And moreover thou art so hushed, and so fearsome in thy\nmail, that I think thou yet deemest me to be a Wight of the Waste,\nsuch as Stone-face thy Fosterer told thee tales of, and forewarned\nthee.  So would I eat before thee, and sign the meat with the sign of\nthe Earth-god's Hammer, to show thee that he is in error concerning\nme, and that I am a very woman flesh and fell, as my kindred were\nbefore me.'\n\nHe laughed and was exceeding glad, and said:  'Tell me now, kind\nfriend, dost thou deem that Stone-face's tales are mere mockery of\nhis dreams, and that he is beguiled by empty semblances or less?  Or\nare there such Wights in the Waste.'\n\n'Nay,' she said, 'the man is a true man; and of these things are\nthere many ancient tales which we may not doubt.  Yet so it is that\nsuch wights have I never yet seen, nor aught to scare me save evil\nmen:  belike it is that I have been over-much busied in dealing with\nsorrow and ruin to look after them:  or it may be that they feared me\nand the wrath-breeding grief of the kindred.'\n\nHe looked at her earnestly, and the wisdom of her heart seemed to\nenter into his; but she said:  'It is of men we must talk, and of me\nand thee.  Come with me, my friend.'\n\nAnd she stepped lightly over the threshold and drew him in.  The Hall\nwas stern and grim and somewhat dusky, for its windows were but\nsmall:  it was all of stone, both walls and roof.  There was no\ntimber-work therein save the benches and chairs, a little about the\ndoors at the lower end that led to the buttery and out-bowers; and\nthis seemed to have been wrought of late years; yea, the chairs\nagainst the gable on the dais were of stone built into the wall,\nadorned with carving somewhat sparingly, the image of the Wolf being\ndone over the midmost of them.  He looked up and down the Hall, and\ndeemed it some seventy feet over all from end to end; and he could\nsee in the dimness those same goodly hangings on the wall which he\nhad seen in the woodland booth.\n\nShe led him up to the dais, and stood there leaning up against the\narm of one of those stone seats silent for a while; then she turned\nand looked at him, and said:\n\n'Yea, thou lookest a goodly warrior; yet am I glad that thou camest\nhither without battle.  Tell me, Gold-mane,' she said, taking one of\nhis spears from his hand, 'art thou deft with the spear?'\n\n'I have been called so,' said he.\n\nShe looked at him sweetly and said:  'Canst thou show me the feat of\nspear-throwing in this Hall, or shall we wend outside presently that\nI may see thee throw?'\n\n'The Hall sufficeth,' he said.  'Shall I set this steel in the lintel\nof the buttery door yonder?'\n\n'Yea, if thou canst,' she said.\n\nHe smiled and took the spear from her, and poised it and shook it\ntill it quivered again, then suddenly drew back his arm and cast, and\nthe shaft sped whistling down the dim hall, and smote the aforesaid\ndoor-lintel and stuck there quivering:  then he sprang down from the\ndais, and ran down the hall, and put forth his hand and pulled it\nforth from the wood, and was on the dais again in a trice, and cast\nagain, and the second time set the spear in the same place, and then\ntook his other spear from the board and cast it, and there stood the\ntwo staves in the wood side by side; then he went soberly down the\nhall and drew them both out of the wood and came back to her, while\nshe stood watching him, her cheek flushed, her lips a little parted.\n\nShe said:  'Good spear-casting, forsooth! and far above what our folk\ncan do, who be no great throwers of the spear.'\n\nGold-mane laughed:  'Sooth is that,' said he, 'or hardly were I here\nto teach thee spear-throwing.'\n\n'Wilt thou NEVER be paid for that simple onslaught?' she said.\n\n'Have I been paid then?' said he.\n\nShe reddened, for she remembered her word to him on the mountain; and\nhe put his hand on her shoulder and kissed her cheek, but timorously;\nnor did she withstand him or shrink aback, but said soberly:\n\n'Good indeed is thy spear-throwing, and meseems my brother will love\nthee when he hath seen thee strike a stroke or two in wrath.  But,\nfair warrior, there be no foemen here:  so get thee to the lower end\nof the Hall, and in the bower beyond shalt thou find fresh water;\nthere wash the waste from off thee, and do off thine helm and\nhauberk, and come back speedily and eat with me; for I hunger, and so\ndost thou.'\n\nHe did as she bade him, and came back presently bearing in his hand\nboth helm and hauberk, and he looked light-limbed and trim and\nlissome, an exceeding goodly man.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.  THE FAIR WOMAN TELLETH FACE-OF-GOD OF HER KINDRED\n\n\n\nWhen he came back to the dais he saw that there was meat upon the\nboard, and the Friend said to him:\n\n'Now art thou Gold-mane indeed:  but come now, sit by me and eat,\nthough the Wood-woman giveth thee but a sorry banquet, O guest; but\nfrom the Dale it is, and we be too far now from the dwellings of men\nto have delicate meat on the board, though to-night when they come\nback thy cheer shall be better.  Yet even then thou shalt have no\nsuch dainties as Stone-face hath imagined for thee at the hands of\nthe Wood-wight.'\n\nShe laughed therewith, and he no less; and in sooth the meat was but\nsimple, of curds and new cheese, meat of the herdsmen.  But Face-of-\ngod said gaily:  'Sweet it shall be to me; good is all that the\nFriend giveth.'\n\nThen she raised her hand and made the sign of the Hammer over the\nboard, and looked up at him and said:\n\n'Hath the Earth-god changed my face, Gold-mane, to what I verily am?'\n\nHe held his face close to hers and looked into it, and him-seemed it\nwas as pure as the waters of a mountain lake, and as fine and well-\nwrought every deal of it as when his father had wrought in his stithy\nmany days and fashioned a small piece of great mastery.  He was\nashamed to kiss her again, but he said to himself, 'This is the\nfairest woman of the world, whom I have sworn to wed this year.'\nThen he spake aloud and said:\n\n'I see the face of the Friend, and it will not change to me.'\n\nAgain she reddened a little, and the happy look in her face seemed to\ngrow yet sweeter, and he was bewildered with longing and delight.\n\nBut she stood up and went to an ambrye in the wall and brought forth\na horn shod and lipped with silver of ancient fashion, and she poured\nwine into it and held it forth and said:\n\n'O guest from the Dale, I pledge thee! and when thou hast drunk to me\nin turn we will talk of weighty matters.  For indeed I bear hopes in\nmy hands too heavy for the daughters of men to bear; and thou art a\nchieftain's son, and mayst well help me to bear them; so let us talk\nsimply and without guile, as folk that trust one another.'\n\nSo she drank and held out the horn to him, and he took the horn and\nher hand both, and he kissed her hand and said:\n\n'Here in this Hall I drink to the Sons of the Wolf, whosoever they\nbe.'  Therewith he drank and he said:  'Simply and guilelessly indeed\nwill I talk with thee; for I am weary of lies, and for thy sake have\nI told a many.'\n\n'Thou shalt tell no more,' she said; 'and as for the health thou hast\ndrunk, it is good, and shall profit thee.  Now sit we here in these\nancient seats and let us talk.'\n\nSo they sat them down while the sun was westering in the March\nafternoon, and she said:\n\n'Tell me first what tidings have been in the Dale.'\n\nSo he told her of the ransackings and of the murder at Carlstead.\n\nShe said:  'These tidings have we heard before, and some deal of them\nwe know better than ye do, or can; for we were the ransackers of\nPenny-thumb and Harts-bane.  Thereof will I say more presently.  What\nother tidings hast thou to tell of?  What oaths were sworn upon the\nBoar last Yule?'\n\nSo he told her of the oath of Bristler the son of Brightling.  She\nsmiled and said:  'He shall keep his oath, and yet redden no blade.'\n\nThen he told of his father's oath, and she said:\n\n'It is good; but even so would he do and no oath sworn.  All men may\ntrust Iron-face.  And thou, my friend, what oath didst thou swear?'\n\nHis face grew somewhat troubled as he said:  'I swore to wed the\nfairest woman in the world, though the Dalesmen gainsaid me, and they\nbeyond the Dale.'\n\n'Yea,' she said, 'and there is no need to ask thee whom thou didst\nmean by thy \"fairest woman,\" for I have seen that thou deemest me\nfair enough.  My friend, maybe thy kindred will be against it, and\nthe kindred of the Bride; and it might be that my kindred would have\ngainsaid it if things were not as they are.  But though all men\ngainsay it, yet will not I.  It is meet and right that we twain wed.'\n\nShe spake very soberly and quietly, but when she had spoken there was\nnothing in his heart but joy and gladness:  yet shame of her\nloveliness refrained him, and he cast down his eyes before hers.\nThen she said in a kind voice:\n\n'I know thee, how glad thou art of this word of mine, because thou\nlookest on me with eyes of love, and thinkest of me as better than I\nam; though I am no ill woman and no beguiler.  But this is not all\nthat I have to say to thee, though it be much; for there are more\nfolk in the world than thou and I only.  But I told thee this first,\nthat thou mightest trust me in all things.  So, my friend, if thou\ncanst, refrain thy joy and thy longing a little, and hearken to what\nconcerneth thee and me, and thy people and mine.'\n\n'Fair woman and sweet friend,' he said, 'thou knowest of a gladness\nwhich is hard to bear if one must lay it aside for a while; and of a\nlonging which is hard to refrain if it mingle with another longing--\nknowest thou not?'\n\n'Yea,' she said, 'I know it.'\n\n'Yet,' said Face-of-god, 'I will forbear as thou biddest me.  Tell\nme, then, what were the felons who were slain at Carlstead?  Knowest\nthou of them?'\n\n'Over well,' she said, 'they are our foes this many a year; and since\nwe met last autumn they have become foes of you Dalesmen also.  Soon\nshall ye have tidings of them; and it was against them that I bade\nthee arm yesterday.'\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'Is it against them that thou wouldst have us do\nbattle along with thy folk?'\n\n'So it is,' she said; 'no other foemen have we.  And now, Gold-mane,\nthou art become a friend of the Wolf, and shalt before long be of\naffinity with our House; that other day thou didst ask me to tell\nthee of me and mine, and now will I do according to thine asking.\nShort shall my tale be; because maybe thou shalt hear it told again,\nand in goodly wise, before thine whole folk.\n\n'As thou wottest we be now outlaws and Wolves' Heads; and whiles we\nlift the gear of men, but ever if we may of ill men and not of good;\nthere is no worthy goodman of the Dale from whom we would take one\nhoof, or a skin of wine, or a cake of wax.\n\n'Wherefore are we outlaws?  Because we have been driven from our own,\nand we bore away our lives and our weapons, and little else; and for\nour lands, thou seest this Vale in the howling wilderness and how\nnarrow and poor it is, though it hath been the nurse of warriors in\ntime past.\n\n'Hearken!  Time long ago came the kindred of the Wolf to these\nMountains of the World; and they were in a pass in the stony maze and\nthe utter wilderness of the Mountains, and the foe was behind them in\nnumbers not to be borne up against.  And so it befell that the pass\nforked, and there were two ways before our Folk; and one part of them\nwould take the way to the north and the other the way to the south;\nand they could not agree which way the whole Folk should take.  So\nthey sundered into two companies, and one took one way and one\nanother.  Now as to those who fared by the southern road, we knew not\nwhat befell them, nor for long and long had we any tale of them.\n\n'But we who took the northern road, we happened on this Vale amidst\nthe wilderness, and we were weary of fleeing from the over-mastering\nfoe; and the dale seemed enough, and a refuge, and a place to dwell\nin, and no man was there before us, and few were like to find it, and\nwe were but a few.  So we dwelt here in this Vale for as wild as it\nis, the place where the sun shineth never in the winter, and scant is\nthe summer sunshine therein.  Here we raised a Doom-ring and builded\nus a Hall, wherein thou now sittest beside me, O friend, and we dwelt\nhere many seasons.\n\n'We had a few sheep in the wilderness, and a few neat fed down the\ngrass of the Vale; and we found gems and copper in the rocks about us\nwherewith at whiles to chaffer with the aliens, and fish we drew from\nour river the Shivering Flood.  Also it is not to be hidden that in\nthose days we did not spare to lift the goods of men; yea, whiles\nwould our warriors fare down unto the edges of the Plain and lie in\nwait there till the time served, and then drive the spoil from under\nthe very walls of the Cities.  Our men were not little-hearted, nor\ndid our women lament the death of warriors over-much, for they were\nthere to bear more warriors to the Folk.\n\n'But the seasons passed, and the Folk multiplied in Shadowy Vale, and\nlivelihood seemed like to fail them, and needs must they seek wider\nlands.  So by ways which thou wilt one day wot of, we came into a\nvalley that lieth north-west of Shadowy Vale:  a land like thine of\nBurgdale, or better; wide it was, plenteous of grass and trees, well\nwatered, full of all things that man can desire.\n\n'Were there men before us in this Dale? sayest thou.  Yea, but not\nvery many, and they feeble in battle, weak of heart, though strong of\nbody.  These, when they saw the Sons of the Wolf with weapons in\ntheir hands, felt themselves puny before us, and their hearts failed\nthem; and they came to us with gifts, and offered to share the Dale\nbetween them and us, for they said there was enough for both folks.\nSo we took their offer and became their friends; and some of our\nHouses wedded wives of the strangers, and gave them their women to\nwife.  Therein they did amiss; for the blended Folk as the\ngenerations passed became softer than our blood, and many were\nuntrusty and greedy and tyrannous, and the days of the whoredom fell\nupon us, and when we deemed ourselves the mightiest then were we the\nnearest to our fall.  But the House whereof I am would never wed with\nthese Westlanders, and other Houses there were who had affinity with\nus who chiefly wedded with us of the Wolf, and their fathers had come\nwith ours into that fruitful Dale; and these were called the Red\nHand, and the Silver Arm, and the Golden Bushel, and the Ragged\nSword.  Thou hast heard those names once before, friend?'\n\n'Yea,' he said, and as he spoke the picture of that other day came\nback to him, and he called to mind all that he had said, and his\nhappiness of that hour seemed the more and the sweeter for that\nmemory.\n\nShe went on:  'Fair and goodly is that Dale as mine own eyes have\nseen, and plentiful of all things, and up in its mountains to the\neast are caves and pits whence silver is digged abundantly; therefore\nis the Dale called Silver-dale.  Hast thou heard thereof, my friend?'\n\n'Nay,' said Face-of-god, 'though I have marvelled whence ye gat such\nfoison of silver.'\n\nHe looked on her and marvelled, for now she seemed as if it were\nanother woman:  her eyes were gleaming bright, her lips were parted;\nthere was a bright red flush on the pommels of her two cheeks as she\nspake again and said:\n\n'Happy lived the Folk in Silver-dale for many and many winters and\nsummers:  the seasons were good and no lack was there:  little\nsickness there was and less war, and all seemed better than well.  It\nis strange that ye Dalesmen have not heard of Silver-dale.'\n\n'Nay,' said he, 'but I have not; of Rose-dale have I heard, as a land\nvery far away:  but no further do we know of toward that airt.  Lieth\nSilver-dale anywhere nigh to Rose-dale?'\n\nShe said:  'It is the next dale to it, yet is it a far journey\nbetwixt the two, for the ice-sea pusheth a horn in betwixt them; and\neven below the ice the mountain-neck is passable to none save a bold\ncrag-climber, and to him only bearing his life in his hands.  But, my\nfriend, I am but lingering over my tale, because it grieveth me sore\nto have to tell it.  Hearken then!  In the days when I had seen but\nten summers, and my brother was a very young man, but exceeding\nstrong, and as beautiful as thou art now, war fell on us without\nrumour or warning; for there swarmed into Silver-dale, though not by\nthe ways whereby we had entered it, a host of aliens, short of\nstature, crooked of limb, foul of aspect, but fierce warriors and\narmed full well:  they were men having no country to go back to,\nthough they had no women or children with them, as we had when we\nwere young in these lands, but used all women whom they took as their\nbeastly lust bade them, making them their thralls if they slew them\nnot.  Soon we found that these foemen asked no more of us than all we\nhad, and therewithal our lives to be cast away or used for their\nservice as beasts of burden or pleasure.  There then we gathered our\nfighting-men and withstood them; and if we had been all of the\nkindreds of the Wolf and the fruit of the wives of warriors, we\nshould have driven back these felons and saved the Dale, though it\nmaybe more than half ruined:  but the most part of us were of that\nmingled blood, or of the generations of the Dalesmen whom we had\nconquered long ago, and stout as they were of body their hearts\nfailed them, and they gave themselves up to the aliens to be as their\noxen and asses.\n\n'Why make a long tale of it?  We who were left, and could brook death\nbut not thraldom, fought it out together, women as well as men, till\nthe sweetness of life and a happy chance for escape bid us flee,\nvanquished but free men.  For at the end of three days' fight we had\nbeen driven up to the easternmost end of the Dale, and up anigh to\nthe jaws of the pass whereby the Folk had first come into Silver-\ndale, and we had those with us who knew every cranny of that way,\nwhile to strangers who knew it not it was utterly impassable; night\nwas coming on also, and even those murder-carles were weary with\nslaying; and, moreover, on this last day, when they saw that they had\nwon all, they were fighting to keep, and not to slay, and a few\nstubborn carles and queens, of what use would they be, or where was\nthe gain of risking life to win them?\n\n'So they forbore us, and night came on moonless and dark; and it was\nthe early spring season, when the days are not yet long, and so by\nnight and cloud we fled away, and back again to Shadowy Vale.\n\n'Forsooth, we were but a few; for when we were gotten into this Vale,\nthis strip of grass and water in the wilderness, and had told up our\ncompany, we were but two hundred and thirty and five of men and women\nand children.  For there were an hundred and thirty and three grown\nmen of all ages, and of women grown seventy and five, and one score\nand seven children, whereof I was one; for, as thou mayst deem, it\nwas easier for grown men with weapons in their hands to escape from\nthat slaughter than for women and children.\n\n'There sat we in yonder Doom-ring and took counsel, and to some it\nseemed good that we should all dwell together in Shadowy Vale, and\nbeset the skirts of the foemen till the days should better; but\nothers deemed that there was little avail therein; and there was a\nmighty man of the kindred, Stone-wolf by name, a man of middle-age,\nand he said, that late in life had he tasted of war, and though the\nbanquet was made bitter with defeat, yet did the meat seem wholesome\nto him.  \"Come down with me to the Cities of the Plain,\" said he,\n\"all you who are stout warriors; and leave we here the old men and\nthe swains and the women and children.  Hateful are the folk there,\nand full of malice, but soft withal and dastardly.  Let us go down\nthither and make ourselves strong amongst them, and sell our valour\nfor their wealth till we come to rule them, and they make us their\nkings, and we establish the Folk of the Wolf amongst the aliens; then\nwill we come back hither and bring away that which we have left.\"\n\n'So he spake, and the more part of the warriors yea said his rede,\nand they went with him to the Westland, and amongst these was my\nbrother Folk-might (for that is his name in the kindred).  And I\nsorrowed at his departure, for he had borne me thither out of the\nflames and the clash of swords and the press of battle, and to me had\nhe ever been kind and loving, albeit he hath had the Words of hard\nand froward used on him full oft.\n\n'So in this Vale abode we that were left, and the seasons passed;\nsome of the elders died, and some of the children also; but more\nchildren were born, for amongst us were men and women to whom it was\nlawful to wed with each other.  Even with this scanty remnant was\nleft some of the life of the kindred of old days; and after we had\nbeen here but a little while, the young men, yea and the old also,\nand even some of the women, would steal through passes that we, and\nwe only, knew of, and would fall upon the Aliens in Silver-dale as\noccasion served, and lift their goods both live and dead; and this\nbecame both a craft and a pastime amongst us.  Nor may I hide that we\nsometimes went lifting otherwhere; for in the summer and autumn we\nwould fare west a little and abide in the woods the season through,\nand hunt the deer thereof, and whiles would we drive the spoil from\nthe scattered folk not far from your Shepherd-Folk; but with the\nShepherds themselves and with you Dalesmen we meddled not.\n\n'Now that little wood-lawn with the toft of an ancient dwelling in\nit, wherein, saith Bow-may, thou didst once rest, was one of our\nsummer abodes; and later on we built the hall under the pine-wood\nthat thou knowest.\n\n'Thus then grew up our young men; and our maids were little softer;\ne'en such as Bow-may is (and kind is she withal), and it seemed in\nvery sooth as if the Spirit of the Wolf was with us, and the\nroughness of the Waste made us fierce; and law we had not and heeded\nnot, though love was amongst us.'\n\nShe stopped awhile and fell a-musing, and her face softened, and she\nturned to him with that sweet happy look upon it and said:\n\n'Desolate and dreary is the Dale, thou deemest, friend; and yet for\nme I love it and its dark-green water, and it is to me as if the\nFathers of the kindred visit it and hold converse with us; and there\nI grew up when I was little, before I knew what a woman was, and\nstrange communings had I with the wilderness.  Friend, when we are\nwedded, and thou art a great chieftain, as thou wilt be, I shall ask\nof thee the boon to suffer me to abide here at whiles that I may\nremember the days when I was little and the love of the kindred waxed\nin me.'\n\n'This is but a little thing to ask,' said Face-of-god; 'I would thou\nhadst asked me more.'\n\n'Fear not,' she said, 'I shall ask thee for much and many things; and\nsome of them belike thou shalt deny me.'\n\nHe shook his head; but she smiled in his face and said:\n\n'Yea, so it is, friend; but hearken.  The seasons passed, and six\nyears wore, and I was grown a tall slim maiden, fleet of foot and\nable to endure toil enough, though I never bore weapons, nor have\ndone.  So on a fair even of midsummer when we were together, the most\nof us, round about this Hall and the Doom-ring, we saw a tall man in\nbright war-gear come forth into the Dale by the path that thou\ncamest, and then another and another till there were two score and\nseven men-at-arms standing on the grass below the scree yonder; by\nthat time had we gotten some weapons in our hands, and we stood\ntogether to meet the new-comers, but they drew no sword and notched\nno shaft, but came towards us laughing and joyous, and lo! it was my\nbrother Folk-might and his men, those that were left of them, come\nback to us from the Westland.\n\n'Glad indeed was I to behold him; and for him when he had taken me in\nhis arms and looked up and down the Dale, he cried out:  'In many\nfair places and many rich dwellings have I been; but this is the hour\nthat I have looked for.'\n\n'Now when we asked him concerning Stone-wolf and the others who were\nmissing (for ten tens of stalwarth men had fared to the Westland), he\nswept out his hand toward the west and said with a solemn face:\n\"There they lie, and grass groweth over their bones, and we who have\ncome aback, and ye who have abided, these are now the children of the\nWolf:  there are no more now on the earth.\"\n\n'Let be!  It was a fair even and high was the feast in the Hall that\nnight, and sweet was the converse with our folk come back.  A glad\nman was my brother Folk-might when he heard that for years past we\nhad been lifting the gear of men, and chiefly of the Aliens in\nSilver-dale:  and he himself was become learned in war and a deft\nleader of men.\n\n'So the days passed and the seasons, and we lived on as we might; but\nwith Folk-might's return there began to grow up in all our hearts\nwhat had long been flourishing in mine, and that was the hope of one\nday winning back our own again, and dying amidst the dear groves of\nSilver-dale.  Within these years we had increased somewhat in number;\nfor if we had lost those warriors in the Westland, and some old men\nwho had died in the Dale, yet our children had grown up (I have now\nseen twenty and one summers) and more were growing up.  Moreover,\nafter the first year, from the time when we began to fall upon the\nDusky Men of Silver-dale, from time to time they who went on such\nadventures set free such thralls of our blood as they could fall in\nwith and whom they could trust in, and they dwelt (and yet dwell)\nwith us in the Dale:  first and last we have taken in three score and\ntwelve of such men, and a score of women-thralls withal.\n\n'Now during these seasons, and not very long ago, after I was a woman\ngrown, the thought came to me, and to Folk-might also, that there\nwere kindreds of the people dwelling anear us whom we might so deal\nwith that they should become our friends and brothers in arms, and\nthat through them we might win back Silver-dale.\n\n'Of Rose-dale we wotted already that the Folk were nought of our\nblood, feeble in the field, cowed by the Dusky Men, and at last made\nthralls to them; so nought was to do there.  But Folk-might went to\nand fro to gather tidings:  at whiles I with him, at whiles one or\nmore of Wood-father's children, who with their father and mother and\nBow-may have abided in the Vale ever since the Great Undoing.\n\n'Soon he fell in with thy Folk, and first of all with the\nWoodlanders, and that was a joy to him; for wot ye what?  He got to\nknow that these men were the children of those of our Folk who had\nsundered from us in the mountain passes time long and long ago; and\nhe loved them, for he saw that they were hardy and trusty, and\nwarriors at heart.\n\n'Then he went amongst the Shepherd-Folk, and he deemed them good men\neasily stirred, and deemed that they might soon be won to friendship;\nand he knew that they were mostly come from the Houses of the\nWoodlanders, so that they also were of the kindred.\n\n'And last he came into Burgdale, and found there a merry and happy\nFolk, little wont to war, but stout-hearted, and nowise puny either\nof body or soul; he went there often and learned much about them, and\ndeemed that they would not be hard to win to fellowship.  And he\nfound that the House of the Face was the chiefest house there; and\nthat the Alderman and his sons were well beloved of all the folk, and\nthat they were the men to be won first, since through them should all\nothers be won.  I also went to Burgstead with him twice, as I told\nthee erst; and I saw thee, and I deemed that thou wouldest lightly\nbecome our friend; and it came into my mind that I myself might wed\nthee, and that the House of the Face thereby might have affinity\nthenceforth with the Children of the Wolf.'\n\nHe said:  'Why didst thou deem thus of me, O friend?'\n\nShe laughed and said:  'Dost thou long to hear me say the words when\nthou knowest my thought well?  So be it.  I saw thee both young and\nfair; and I knew thee to be the son of a noble, worthy, guileless man\nand of a beauteous woman of great wits and good rede.  And I found\nthee to be kind and open-handed and simple like thy father, and like\nthy mother wiser than thou thyself knew of thyself; and that thou\nwert desirous of deeds and fain of women.'\n\nShe was silent for a while, and he also:  then he said:  'Didst thou\ndraw me to the woods and to thee?'\n\nShe reddened and said:  'I am no spell-wife:  but true it is that\nWood-mother made a waxen image of thee, and thrust through the heart\nthereof the pin of my girdle-buckle, and stroked it every morning\nwith an oak-bough over which she had sung spells.  But dost thou not\nremember, Gold-mane, how that one day last Hay-month, as ye were\nresting in the meadows in the cool of the evening, there came to you\na minstrel that played to you on the fiddle, and therewith sang a\nsong that melted all your hearts, and that this song told of the\nWild-wood, and what was therein of desire and peril and beguiling and\ndeath, and love unto Death itself?  Dost thou remember, friend?'\n\n'Yea,' he said, 'and how when the minstrel was done Stone-face fell\nto telling us more tales yet of the woodland, and the minstrel sang\nagain and yet again, till his tales had entered into my very heart.'\n\n'Yea,' she said, 'and that minstrel was Wood-wont; and I sent him to\nsing to thee and thine, deeming that if thou didst hearken, thou\nwould'st seek the woodland and happen upon us.'\n\nHe laughed and said:  'Thou didst not doubt but that if we met, thou\nmightest do with me as thou wouldest?'\n\n'So it is,' she said, 'that I doubted it little.'\n\n'Therein wert thou wise,' said Face-of-god; 'but now that we are\ntalking without guile to each other, mightest thou tell me wherefore\nit was that Folk-might made that onslaught upon me?  For certain it\nis that he was minded to slay me.'\n\nShe said:  'It was sooth what I told thee, that whiles he groweth so\nbattle-eager that whatso edge-tool he beareth must needs come out of\nthe scabbard; but there was more in it than that, which I could not\ntell thee erst.  Two days before thy coming he had been down to\nBurgstead in the guise of an old carle such as thou sawest him with\nme in the market-place.  There was he guested in your Hall, and once\nmore saw thee and the Bride together; and he saw the eyes of love\nwherewith she looked on thee (for so much he told me), and deemed\nthat thou didst take her love but lightly.  And he himself looked on\nher with such love (and this he told me not) that he deemed nought\ngood enough for her, and would have had thee give thyself up wholly\nto her; for my brother is a generous man, my friend.  So when I told\nhim on the morn of that day whereon we met that we looked to see thee\nthat eve (for indeed I am somewhat foreseeing), he said:  \"Look thou,\nSun-beam, if he cometh, it is not unlike that I shall drive a spear\nthrough him.\"  \"Wherefore?\" said I; \"can he serve our turn when he is\ndead?\"  Said he:  \"I care little.  Mine own turn will I serve.  Thou\nsayest WHEREFORE?  I tell thee this stripling beguileth to her\ntorment the fairest woman that is in the world--such an one as is\nmeet to be the mother of chieftains, and to stand by warriors in\ntheir day of peril.  I have seen her; and thus have I seen her.\"\nThen said I:  \"Greatly forsooth shalt thou pleasure her by slaying\nhim!\"  And he answered:  \"I shall pleasure myself.  And one day she\nshall thank me, when she taketh my hand in hers and we go together to\nthe Bride-bed.\"  Therewith came over me a clear foresight of the\nhours to come, and I said to him:  \"Yea, Folk-might, cast the spear\nand draw the sword; but him thou shalt not slay:  and thou shalt one\nday see him standing with us before the shafts of the Dusky Men.\"  So\nI spake; but he looked fiercely at me, and departed and shunned me\nall that day, and by good hap I was hard at hand when thou drewest\nnigh our abode.  Nay, Gold-mane, what would'st thou with thy sword?\nWhy art thou so red and wrathful?  Would'st thou fight with my\nbrother because he loveth thy friend, thine old playmate, thy\nkinswoman, and thinketh pity of her sorrow?'\n\nHe said, with knit brow and gleaming eyes:  'Would the man take her\naway from me perforce?'\n\n'My friend,' she said, 'thou art not yet so wise as not to be a fool\nat whiles.  Is it not so that she herself hath taken herself from\nthee, since she hath come to know that thou hast given thyself to\nanother?  Hath she noted nought of thee this winter and spring?  Is\nshe well pleased with the ways of thee?'\n\nHe said:  'Thou hast spoken simply with me, and I will do no less\nwith thee.  It was but four days agone that she did me to wit that\nshe knew of me how I sought my love on the Mountain; and she put me\nto sore shame, and afterwards I wept for her sorrow.'\n\nTherewith he told her all that the Bride had said to him, as he well\nmight, for he had forgotten no word of it.\n\nThen said the Friend:  'She shall have the token that she craveth,\nand it is I that shall give it to her.'\n\nTherewith she took from her finger a ring wherein was set a very fair\nchangeful mountain-stone, and gave it to him, and said:\n\n'Thou shalt give her this and tell her whence thou hadst it; and tell\nher that I bid her remember that To-morrow is a new day.'\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.  THOSE TWO TOGETHER HOLD THE RING OF THE EARTH-GOD\n\n\n\nAnd now they fell silent both of them, and sat hearkening the sounds\nof the Dale, from the whistle of the plover down by the water-side to\nthe far-off voices of the children and maidens about the kine in the\nlower meadows.  At last Gold-mane took up the word and said:\n\n'Sweet friend, tell me the uttermost of what thou would'st have of\nme.  Is it not that I should stand by thee and thine in the Folk-mote\nof the Dalesmen, and speak for you when ye pray us for help against\nyour foemen; and then again that I do my best when ye and we are\narrayed for battle against the Dusky Men?  This is easy to do, and\ngreat is the reward thou offerest me.'\n\n'I look for this service of thee,' she said, 'and none other.'\n\n'And when I go down to the battle,' said he, 'shalt thou be sorry for\nour sundering?'\n\nShe said:  'There shall be no sundering; I shall wend with thee.'\n\nSaid he:  'And if I were slain in the battle, would'st thou lament\nme?'\n\n'Thou shalt not be slain,' she said.\n\nAgain was there silence betwixt them, till at last he said:\n\n'This then is why thou didst draw me to thee in the Wild-wood?'\n\n'Yea,' said she.\n\nAgain for a while no word was spoken, and Face-of-god looked on her\ntill she cast her eyes down before him.\n\nThen at last he spake, and the colour came and went in his face as he\nsaid:  'Tell me thy name what it is.'\n\nShe said:  'I am called the Sun-beam.'\n\nThen he said, and his voice trembled therewith:  'O Sun-beam, I have\nbeen seeking pleasant and cunning words, and can find none such.  But\ntell me this if thou wilt:  dost thou desire me as I desire thee? or\nis it that thou wilt suffer me to wed thee and bed thee at last as\nmere payment for the help that I shall give to thee and thine?  Nay,\ndoubt it not that I will take the payment, if this is what thou wilt\ngive me and nought else.  Yet tell me.'\n\nHer face grew troubled, and she said:\n\n'Gold-mane, maybe that thou hast now asked me one question too many;\nfor this is no fair game to be played between us.  For thee, as I\ndeem, there are this day but two people in the world, and that is\nthou and I, and the earth is for us two alone.  But, my friend,\nthough I have seen but twenty and one summers, it is nowise so with\nme, and to me there are many in the world; and chiefly the Folk of\nthe Wolf, amidst whose very heart I have grown up.  Moreover, I can\nthink of her whom I have supplanted, the Bride to wit; and I know\nher, and how bitter and empty her days shall be for a while, and how\nvain all our redes for her shall seem to her.  Yea, I know her\nsorrow, and see it and grieve for it:  so canst not thou, unless thou\nverily see her before thee, her face unhappy, and her voice changed\nand hard.  Well, I will tell thee what thou askest.  When I drew thee\nto me on the Mountain I thought but of the friendship and brotherhood\nto be knitted up between our two Folks, nor did I anywise desire thy\nlove of a young man.  But when I saw thee on the heath and in the\nHall that day, it pleased me to think that a man so fair and\nchieftain-like should one day lie by my side; and again when I saw\nthat the love of me had taken hold of thee, I would not have thee\ngrieved because of me, but would have thee happy.  And now what shall\nI say?--I know not; I cannot tell.  Yet am I the Friend, as erst I\ncalled myself.\n\n'And, Gold-mane, I have seen hitherto but the outward show and image\nof thee, and though that be goodly, how would it be if thou didst\nshame me with little-heartedness and evil deeds?  Let me see thee in\nthe Folk-mote and the battle, and then may I answer thee.'\n\nThen she held her peace, and he answered nothing; and she turned her\nface from him and said:\n\n'Out on it! have I beguiled myself as well as thee?  These are but\nempty words I have been saying.  If thou wilt drag the truth out of\nme, this is the very truth:  that to-day is happy to me as it is to\nthee, and that I have longed sore for its coming.  O Gold-mane, O\nspeech-friend, if thou wert to pray me or command me that I lie in\nthine arms to-night, I should know not how to gainsay thee.  Yet I\nbeseech thee to forbear, lest thy death and mine come of it.  And why\nshould we die, O friend, when we are so young, and the world lies so\nfair before us, and the happy days are at hand when the Children of\nthe Wolf and the kindreds of the Dale shall deliver the Folk, and all\ndays shall be good and all years?'\n\nThey had both risen up as she spake, and now he put forth his hands\nto her and took her in his arms, wondering the while, as he drew her\nto him, how much slenderer and smaller and weaker she seemed in his\nembrace than he had thought of her; and when their lips met, he felt\nthat she kissed him as he her.  Then he held her by the shoulders at\narms' length from him, and beheld her face how her eyes were closed\nand her lips quivering.  But before him, in a moment of time, passed\na picture of the life to be in the fair Dale, and all she would give\nhim there, and the days good and lovely from morn to eve and eve to\nmorn; and though in that moment it was hard for him to speak, at last\nhe spoke in a voice hoarse at first, and said:\n\n'Thou sayest sooth, O friend; we will not die, but live; I will not\ndrag our deaths upon us both, nor put a sword in the hands of Folk-\nmight, who loves me not.'\n\nThen he kissed her on the brow and said:  'Now shalt thou take me by\nthe hand and lead me forth from the Hall.  For the day is waxing old,\nand here meseemeth in this dim hall there are words crossing in the\nair about us--words spoken in days long ago, and tales of old time,\nthat keep egging me on to do my will and die, because that is all\nthat the world hath for a valiant man; and to such words I would not\nhearken, for in this hour I have no will to die, nor can I think of\ndeath.'\n\nShe took his hand and led him forth without more words, and they went\nhand in hand and paced slowly round the Doom-ring, the light air\nbreathing upon them till their faces were as calm and quiet as their\nwont was, and hers especially as bright and happy as when he had\nfirst seen her that day.\n\nThe sun was sinking now, and only sent one golden ray into the valley\nthrough a cleft in the western rock-wall, but the sky overhead was\nbright and clear; from the meadows came the sound of the lowing of\nkine and the voices of children a-sporting, and it seemed to Gold-\nmane that they were drawing nigher, both the children and the kine,\nand somewhat he begrudged it that he should not be alone with the\nFriend.\n\nNow when they had made half the circuit of the Doom-ring, the Sun-\nbeam stopped him, and then led him through the Ring of Stones, and\nbrought him up to the altar which was amidst of it; and the altar was\na great black stone hewn smooth and clean, and with the image of the\nWolf carven on the front thereof; and on its face lay the gold ring\nwhich the priest or captain of the Folk bore on his arm between the\nGod and the people at all folk-motes.\n\nSo she said:  'This is the altar of the God of Earth, and often hath\nit been reddened by mighty men; and thereon lieth the Ring of the\nSons of the Wolf; and now it were well that we swore troth on that\nring before my brother cometh; for now will he soon be here.'\n\nThen Gold-mane took the Ring and thrust his right hand through it,\nand took her right hand in his; so that the Ring lay on both their\nhands, and therewith he spake aloud:\n\n'I am Face-of-god of the House of the Face, and I do thee to wit, O\nGod of the Earth, that I pledge my troth to this woman, the Sun-beam\nof the Kindred of the Wolf, to beget my offspring on her, and to live\nwith her, and to die with her:  so help me, thou God of the Earth,\nand the Warrior and the God of the Face!'\n\nThen spake the Sun-beam:  'I, the Sun-beam of the Children of the\nWolf, pledge my troth to Face-of-god to lie in his bed and to bear\nhis children and none other's, and to be his speech-friend till I\ndie:  so help me the Wolf and the Warrior and the God of the Earth!'\n\nThen they laid the Ring on the altar again, and they kissed each\nother long and sweetly, and then turned away from the altar and\ndeparted from the Doom-ring, going hand in hand together down the\nmeadow, and as they went, the noise of the kine and the children grew\nnearer and nearer, and presently came the whole company of them round\na ness of the rock-wall; there were some thirty little lads and\nlasses driving on the milch-kine, with half a score of older maids\nand grown women, one of whom was Bow-may, who was lightly and\nscantily clad, as one who heeds not the weather, or deems all months\nmidsummer.\n\nThe children came running up merrily when they saw the Sun-beam, but\nstopped short shyly when they noted the tall fair stranger with her.\nThey were all strong and sturdy children, and some very fair, but\nbrown with the weather, if not with the sun.  Bow-may came up to\nGold-mane and took his hand and greeted him kindly and said:\n\n'So here thou art at last in Shadowy Vale; and I hope that thou art\ncontent therewith, and as happy as I would wish thee to be.  Well,\nthis is the first time; and when thou comest the second time it may\nwell be that the world shall be growing better.'\n\nShe held the distaff which she bore in her hand (for she had been\nspinning) as if it were a spear; her limbs were goodly and shapely,\nand she trod the thick grass of the Vale with a kind of wary\nfirmness, as though foemen might be lurking nearby.  The Sun-beam\nsmiled upon her kindly and said:\n\n'That shall not fail to be, Bow-may:  ye have won a new friend to-\nday.  But tell me, when dost thou look to see the men here, for I was\ndown by the water when they went away yesterday?'\n\n'They shall come into the Dale a little after sunset,' said Bow-may.\n\n'Shall I abide them, my friend?' said Gold-mane, turning to the Sun-\nbeam.\n\n'Yea,' she said; 'for what else art thou come hither? or art thou so\npressed to depart from us?  Last time we met thou wert not so hasty\nto sunder.'\n\nThey smiled on each other; and Bow-may looked on them and laughed\noutright; then a flush showed in her cheeks through the tan of them,\nand she turned toward the children and the other women who were\nbusied about the milking of the kine.\n\nBut those two sat down together on a bank amidst the plain meadow,\nfacing the river and the eastern rock-wall, and the Sun-beam said:\n\n'I am fain to speak to thee and to see thine eyes watching me while I\nspeak; and now, my friend, I will tell thee something unasked which\nhas to do with what e'en now thou didst ask me; for I would have thee\ntrust me wholly, and know me for what I am.  Time was I schemed and\nplanned for this day of betrothal; but now I tell thee it has become\nno longer needful for bringing to pass our fellowship in arms with\nthy people.  Yea yesterday, ere he went on a hunt, whereof he shall\ntell thee, Folk-might was against it, in words at least; and yet as\none who would have it done if he might have no part in it.  So, in\ngood sooth, this hand that lieth in thine is the hand of a wilful\nwoman, who desireth a man, and would keep him for her speech-friend.\nNow art thou fond and happy; yet bear in mind that there are deeds to\nbe done, and the troth we have just plighted must be paid for.  So\nhearken, I bid thee.  Dost thou care to know why the wheedling of\nthee is no longer needful to us?'\n\nHe said:  'A little while ago I should have said, Yea, If thy lips\nsay the words.  But now, O friend, it seemeth as if thine heart were\nalready become a part of mine, and I feel as if the chieftain were\ngrowing up in me and the longing for deeds:  so I say, Tell me, for I\nwere fain to hear what toucheth the welfare of thy Folk and their\nfellowship with my Folk; for on that also have I set my heart?'\n\nShe said gravely and with solemn eyes:\n\n'What thou sayest is good:  full glad am I that I have not plighted\nmy troth to a mere goodly lad, but rather to a chieftain and a\nwarrior.  Now then hearken!  Since I saw thee first in the autumn\nthis hath happened, that the Dusky Men, increasing both in numbers\nand insolence, have it in their hearts to win more than Silver-dale,\nand it is years since they have fallen upon Rose-dale and conquered\nit, rather by murder than by battle, and made all men thralls there,\nfor feeble were the Folk thereof; and doubt it not but that they will\nlook into Burgdale before long.  They are already abroad in the\nwoods, and were it not for the fear of the Wolf they would be thicker\ntherein, and faring wider; for we have slain many of them, coming\nupon them unawares; and they know not where we dwell, nor who we be:\nso they fear to spread about over-much and pry into unknown places\nlest the Wolf howl on them.  Yet beware! for they will gather in\nnumbers that we may not meet, and then will they swarm into the Dale;\nand if ye would live your happy life that ye love so well, ye must\nnow fight for it; and in that battle must ye needs join yourselves to\nus, that we may help each other.  Herein have ye nought to choose,\nfor now with you it is no longer a thing to talk of whether ye will\nhelp certain strangers and guests and thereby win some gain to\nyourselves, but whether ye have the hearts to fight for yourselves,\nand the wits to be the fellows of tall men and stout warriors who\nhave pledged their lives to win or die for it.'\n\nShe was silent a little and then turned and looked fondly on Face-of-\ngod and said:\n\n'Therefore, Gold-mane, we need thee no longer; for thou must needs\nfight in our battle.  I have no longer aught to do to wheedle thee to\nlove me.  Yet if thou wilt love me, then am I a glad woman.'\n\nHe said:  'Thou wottest well that thou hast all my love, neither will\nI fail thee in the battle.  I am not little-hearted, though I would\nhave given myself to thee for no reward.'\n\n'It is well,' said the Sun-beam; 'nought is undone by that which I\nhave done.  Moreover, it is good that we have plighted troth to-day.\nFor Folk-might will presently hear thereof, and he must needs abide\nthe thing which is done.  Hearken! he cometh.'\n\nFor as she spoke there came a glad cry from the women and children,\nand those two stood up and turned toward the west and beheld the\nwarriors of the Wolf coming down into the Dale by the way that Gold-\nmane had come.\n\n'Come,' said the Sun-beam, 'here are your brethren in arms, let us go\ngreet them; they will rejoice in thee.'\n\nSo they went thither, and there stood eighty and seven men on the\ngrass below the scree and Folk-might their captain; and besides some\nvaliant women, and a few carles who were on watch on the waste, and a\nhalf score who had been left in the Dale, these were all the warriors\nof the Wolf.  They were clad in no holiday raiment, not even Folk-\nmight, but were in sheep-brown gear of the coarsest, like to\nhusbandmen late come from the plough, but armed well and goodly.\n\nBut when the twain drew near, the men clashed their spears on their\nshields, and cried out for joy of them, for they all knew what Face-\nof-god's presence there betokened of fellowship with the kindreds;\nbut Folk-might came forward and took Face-of-god's hand and greeted\nhim and said:\n\n'Hail, son of the Alderman!  Here hast thou come into the ancient\nabode of chieftains and warriors, and belike deeds await thee also.'\n\nYet his brow was knitted as he said these words, and he spake slowly,\nas one that constraineth himself; but presently his face cleared\nsomewhat and he said:\n\n'Dalesman, it behoveth thy people to bestir them if ye would live and\nsee good days.  Hath my sister told thee what is toward?  Or what\nsayest thou?'\n\n'Hail to thee, son of the Wolf!' said Face-of-god.  'Thy sister hath\ntold me all; and even if these Dusky Felons were not our foe-men\nalso, yet could I have my way, we should have given thee all help,\nand should have brought back peace and good days to thy folk.'\n\nThen Folk-might flushed red and spake, as he cast out his hand\ntowards the warriors and up and down toward the Dale:\n\n'These be my folk, and these only:  and as to peace, only those of us\nknow of it who are old men.  Yet is it well; and if we and ye\ntogether be strong enough to bring back good days to the feeble men\nwhom the Dusky Ones torment in Silver-dale it shall be better yet.'\n\nThen he turned about to his sister, and looked keenly into her eyes\ntill she reddened, and took her hand and looked at the wrist and\nsaid:\n\n'O sister, see I not the mark on thy wrist of the Ring of the God of\nthe Earth?  Have not oaths been sworn since yesterday?'\n\n'True it is,' she said, 'that this man and I have plighted troth\ntogether at the altar of the Doom-ring.'\n\nSaid Folk-might:  'Thou wilt have thy will, and I may not amend it.'\nTherewith he turned about to Face-of-god and said:\n\n'Thou must look to it to keep this oath, whatever other one thou hast\nfailed in.'\n\nSaid Face-of-god somewhat wrathfully:  'I shall keep it, whether thou\nbiddest me to keep it or break it.'\n\n'That is well,' said Folk-might, 'and then for all that hath gone\nbefore thou mayest in a manner pay, if thou art dauntless before the\nfoe.'\n\n'I look to be no blencher in the battle,' said Face-of-god; 'that is\nnot the fashion of our kindred, whosoever may be before us.  Yea, and\neven were it thy blade, O mighty warrior of the Wolf, I would do my\nbest to meet it in manly fashion.'\n\nAs he spake he half drew forth Dale-warden from his sheath, looking\nsteadily into the eyes of Folk-might; and the Sun-beam looked upon\nhim happily.  But Folk-might laughed and said:\n\n'Thy sword is good, and I deem that thine heart will not fail thee;\nbut it is by my side and not in face of me that thou shalt redden the\ngood blade:  I see not the day when we twain shall hew at each\nother.'\n\nThen in a while he spake again:\n\n'Thou must pardon us if our words are rough; for we have stood in\nrough places, where we had to speak both short and loud, whereas\nthere was much to do.  But now will we twain talk of matters that\nconcern chieftains who are going on a hard adventure.  And ye women,\ndo ye dight the Hall for the evening feast, which shall be the feast\nof the troth-plight for you twain.  This indeed we owe thee, O guest;\nfor little shall be thine heritage which thou shalt have with my\nsister, over and above that thy sword winneth for thee.'\n\nBut the Sun-beam said:  'Hast thou any to-night?'\n\n'Yea,' he said; 'Spear-god, how many was it?'\n\nThere came forward a tall man bearing an axe in his right hand, and\ncarrying over his shoulder by his left hand a bundle of silver arm-\nrings just such as Gold-mane had seen on the felons who were slain by\nWood-grey's house.  The carle cast them on the ground and then knelt\ndown and fell to telling them over; and then looked up and said:\n'Twelve yesterday in the wood where the battle was going on; and this\nmorning seven by the tarn in the pine-wood and six near this eastern\nedge of the wood:  one score and five all told.  But, Folk-might,\nthey are coming nigh to Shadowy Vale.'\n\n'Sooth is that,' said Folk-might; 'but it shall be looked to.  Come\nnow apart with me, Face-of-god.'\n\nSo the others went their ways toward the Hall, while Folk-might led\nthe Burgdaler to a sheltered nook under the sheer rocks, and there\nthey sat down to talk, and Folk-might asked Gold-mane closely of the\nmuster of the Dalesmen and the Shepherds and the Woodland Caries, and\nhe was well pleased when Face-of-god told him of how many could march\nto a stricken field, and of their archery, and of their weapons and\ntheir goodness.\n\nAll this took some time in the telling, and now night was coming on\napace, and Folk-might said:\n\n'Now will it be time to go to the Hall; but keep in thy mind that\nthese Dusky Men will overrun you unless ye deal with them betimes.\nThese are of the kind that ye must cast fear into their hearts by\nfalling on them; for if ye abide till they fall upon you, they are\nlike the winter wolves that swarm on and on, how many soever ye slay.\nAnd this above all things shall help you, that we shall bring you\nwhereas ye shall fall on them unawares and destroy them as boys do\nwith a wasp's nest.  Yet shall many a mother's son bite the dust.\n\n'Is it not so that in four weeks' time is your spring-feast and\nmarket at Burgstead, and thereafter the great Folk-mote?'\n\n'So it is,' said Gold-mane.\n\n'Thither shall I come then,' said Folk-might, 'and give myself out\nfor the slayer of Rusty and the ransacker of Harts-bane and Penny-\nthumb; and therefor shall I offer good blood-wite and theft-wite; and\nthy father shall take that; for he is a just man.  Then shall I tell\nmy tale.  Yet it may be thou shalt see us before if battle betide.\nAnd now fair befall this new year; for soon shall the scabbards be\nempty and the white swords be dancing in the air, and spears and axes\nshall be the growth of this spring-tide.'\n\nAnd he leaped up from his seat and walked to and fro before Gold-\nmane, and now was it grown quite dark.  Then Folk-might turned to\nFace-of-god and said:\n\n'Come, guest, the windows of the Hall are yellow; let us to the\nfeast.  To-morrow shalt thou get thee to the beginning of this work.\nI hope of thee that thou art a good sword; else have I done a folly\nand my sister a worse one.  But now forget that, and feast.'\n\nGold-mane arose, not very well at ease, for the man seemed\noverbearing; yet how might he fall upon the Sun-beam's kindred, and\nthe captain of these new brethren in arms?  So he spake not.  But\nFolk-might said to him:\n\n'Yet I would not have thee forget that I was wroth with thee when I\nsaw thee to-day; and had it not been for the coming battle I had\ndrawn sword upon thee.'\n\nThen Face-of-god's wrath was stirred, and he said:\n\n'There is yet time for that! but why art thou wroth with me?  And I\nshall tell thee that there is little manliness in thy chiding.  For\nhow may I fight with thee, thou the brother of my plighted speech-\nfriend and my captain in this battle?'\n\n'Therein thou sayest sooth,' said Folk-might; 'but hard it was to see\nyou two standing together; and thou canst not give the Bride to me as\nI give my sister to thee.  For I have seen her, and I have seen her\nlooking at thee; and I know that she will not have it so.'\n\nThen they went on together toward the Hall, and Face-of-god was\nsilent and somewhat troubled; and as they drew near to the Hall,\nFolk-might spake again:\n\n'Yet time may amend it; and if not, there is the battle, and maybe\nthe end.  Now be we merry!'\n\nSo they went into the Hall together, and there was the Sun-beam\ngloriously arrayed, as erst in the woodland bower, and Face-of-god\nsat on the dais beside her, and the uttermost sweetness of desire\nentered into his soul as he noted her eyes and her mouth, that were\ngrown so kind to him, and her hand that strayed toward his.\n\nThe Hall was full of folk, and all those warriors were there with\nWood-father and his sons, and Wood-mother, and Bow-may and many other\nwomen; and Gold-mane looked down the Hall and deemed that he had\nnever seen such stalwarth bodies of men, or so bold and meet for\nbattle:  as for the women he had seen fairer in Burgdale, but these\nwere fair of their own fashion, shapely and well-knit, and strong-\narmed and large-limbed, yet sweet-voiced and gentle withal.  Nay, the\nvery lads of fifteen winters or so, whereof a few were there, seemed\nbold and bright-eyed and keen of wit, and it seemed like that if the\nwarriors fared afield these would be with them.\n\nSo wore the feast; and Folk-might as aforetime amongst the healths\ncalled on men to drink to the Jaws of the Wolf, and the Red Hand, and\nthe Silver Arm, and the Golden Bushel, and the Ragged Sword.  But now\nhad Face-of-god no need to ask what these meant, since he knew that\nthey were the names of the kindreds of the Wolf.  They drank also to\nthe troth-plight and to those twain, and shouted aloud over the\nhealth and clashed their weapons:  and Gold-mane wondered what echo\nof that shout would reach to Burgstead.\n\nThen sang men songs of old time, and amongst them Wood-wont stood\nwith his fiddle amidst the Hall and Bow-may beside him, and they sang\nin turn to it sweetly and clearly; and this is some of what they\nsang:\n\n\nShe singeth.\n\nWild is the waste and long leagues over;\n   Whither then wend ye spear and sword,\nWhere nought shall see your helms but the plover,\n   Far and far from the dear Dale's sward?\n\nHe singeth.\n\nMany a league shall we wend together\n   With helm and spear and bended bow.\nHark! how the wind blows up for weather:\n   Dark shall the night be whither we go.\n\nDark shall the night be round the byre,\n   And dark as we drive the brindled kine;\nDark and dark round the beacon-fire,\n   Dark down in the pass round our wavering line.\n\nTurn on thy path, O fair-foot maiden,\n   And come our ways by the pathless road;\nLook how the clouds hang low and laden\n   Over the walls of the old abode!\n\nShe singeth.\n\nBare are my feet for the rough waste's wending,\n   Wild is the wind, and my kirtle's thin;\nFaint shall I be ere the long way's ending\n   Drops down to the Dale and the grief therein.\n\nHe singeth.\n\nDo on the brogues of the wild-wood rover,\n   Do on the byrnies' ring-close mail;\nTake thou the staff that the barbs hang over,\n   O'er the wind and the waste and the way to prevail.\n\nCome, for how from thee shall I sunder?\n   Come, that a tale may arise in the land;\nCome, that the night may be held for a wonder,\n   When the Wolf was led by a maiden's hand!\n\nShe singeth.\n\nNow will I fare as ye are faring,\n   And wend no way but the way ye wend;\nAnd bear but the burdens ye are bearing,\n   And end the day as ye shall end.\n\nAnd many an eve when the clouds are drifting\n   Down through the Dale till they dim the roof,\nShall they tell in the Hall of the Maiden's Lifting,\n   And how we drave the spoil aloof.\n\nThey sing together.\n\nOver the moss through the wind and the weather,\n   Through the morn and the eve and the death of the day,\nWend we man and maid together,\n   For out of the waste is born the fray.\n\n\nThen the Sun-beam spake to Gold-mane softly, and told him how this\nsong was made by a minstrel concerning a foray in the early days of\ntheir first abode in Shadowy Vale, and how in good sooth a maiden led\nthe fray and was the captain of the warriors:\n\n'Erst,' she said, 'this was counted as a wonder; but now we are so\nfew that it is no wonder though the women will do whatsoever they\nmay.'\n\nSo they talked, and Gold-mane was very happy; but ere the good-night\ncup was drunk, Folk-might spake to Face-of-god and said:\n\n'It were well that ye rose betimes in the morning:  but thou shalt\nnot go back by the way thou camest.  Wood-wise and another shall go\nwith thee, and show thee a way across the necks and the heaths, which\nis rough enough as far as toil goes, but where thy life shall be\nsafer; and thereby shalt thou hit the ghyll of the Weltering Water,\nand so come down safely into Burgdale.  Now that we are friends and\nfellows, it is no hurt for thee to know the shortest way to Shadowy\nVale.  What thou shalt tell concerning us in Burgdale I leave the\ntale thereof to thee; yet belike thou wilt not tell everything till I\ncome to Burgstead at the spring market-tide.  Now must I presently to\nbed; for before daylight to-morrow must I be following the hunt along\nwith two score good men of ours.'\n\n'What beast is afield then?' said Gold-mane.\n\nSaid Folk-might:  'The beasts that beset our lives, the Dusky Men.\nIn these days we have learned how to find companies of them; and\nforsooth every week they draw nigher to this Dale; and some day they\nshould happen upon us if we were not to look to it, and then would\nthere be a murder great and grim; therefore we scour the heaths round\nabout, and the skirts of the woodland, and we fall upon these felons\nin divers guises, so that they may not know us for the same men;\nwhiles are we clad in homespun, as to-day, and seem like to field-\nworking carles; whiles in scarlet and gold, like knights of the\nWestland; whiles in wolf-skins; whiles in white glittering gear, like\nthe Wights of the Waste:  and in all guises these felons, for all\ntheir fierce hearts, fear us, and flee from us, and we follow and\nslay them, and so minish their numbers somewhat against the great day\nof battle.'\n\n'Tell me,' said Gold-mane; 'when we fall upon Silver-dale shall their\nthralls, the old Dale-dwellers, fight for them or for us?'\n\nSaid Folk-might:  'The Dusky Men will not dare to put weapons into\nthe hands of their thralls.  Nay, the thralls shall help us; for\nthough they have but small stomach for the fight, yet joyfully when\nthe fight is over shall they cut their masters' throats.'\n\n'How is it with these thralls?' said Gold-mane.  'I have never seen a\nthrall.'\n\n'But I,' said Folk-might, 'have seen a many down in the Cities.  And\nthere were thralls who were the tyrants of thralls, and held the whip\nover them; and of the others there were some who were not very hardly\nentreated.  But with these it is otherwise, and they all bear\ngrievous pains daily; for the Dusky Men are as hogs in a garden of\nlilies.  Whatsoever is fair there have they defiled and deflowered,\nand they wallow in our fair halls as swine strayed from the dunghill.\nNo delight in life, no sweet days do they have for themselves, and\nthey begrudge the delight of others therein.  Therefore their thralls\nknow no rest or solace; their reward of toil is many stripes, and the\nhealing of their stripes grievous toil.  To many have they appointed\nto dig and mine in the silver-yielding cliffs, and of all the tasks\nis that the sorest, and there do stripes abound the most.  Such\nthralls art thou happy not to behold till thou hast set them free; as\nwe shall do.'\n\n'Tell me again,' said Face-of-god; 'Is there no mixed folk between\nthese Dusky Men and the Dalesmen, since they have no women of their\nown, but lie with the women of the Dale?  Moreover, do not the poor\nfolk of the Dale beget and bear children, so that there are thralls\nborn of thralls?'\n\n'Wisely thou askest this,' said Folk-might, 'but thereof shall I tell\nthee, that when a Dusky Carle mingles with a woman of the Dale, the\nchild which she beareth shall oftenest favour his race and not hers;\nor else shall it be witless, a fool natural.  But as for the children\nof these poor thralls; yea, the masters cause them to breed if so\ntheir masterships will, and when the children are born, they keep\nthem or slay them as they will, as they would with whelps or calves.\nTo be short, year by year these vile wretches grow fiercer and more\nbeastly, and their thralls more hapless and down-trodden; and now at\nlast is come the time either to do or to die, as ye men of Burgdale\nshall speedily find out.  But now must I go sleep if I am to be where\nI look to be at sunrise to-morrow.'\n\nTherewith he called for the sleeping-cup, and it was drunk, and all\nmen fared to bed.  But the Sun-beam took Gold-mane's hand ere they\nparted, and said:\n\n'I shall arise betimes on the morrow; so I say not farewell to-night;\nyea, and after to-morrow it shall not be long ere we meet again.'\n\nSo Gold-mane lay down in that ancient hall, and it seemed to him ere\nhe slept as if his own kindred were slipping away from him and he\nwere becoming a child of the Wolf.  'And yet,' said he to himself, 'I\nam become a man; for my Friend, now she no longer telleth me to do or\nforbear, and I tremble.  Nay, rather she is fain to take the word\nfrom me; and this great warrior and ripe man, he talketh with me as\nif I were a chieftain meet for converse with chieftains.  Even so it\nis and shall be.'\n\nAnd soon thereafter he fell asleep in the Hall in Shadowy Vale.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.  FACE-OF-GOD LOOKETH ON THE DUSKY MEN\n\n\n\nWhen he awoke again he saw a man standing over him, and knew him for\nWood-wise:  he was clad in his war-gear, and had his quiver at his\nback and his bow in his hand, for Wood-father's children were all\ngood bowmen, though not so sure as Bow-may.  He spake to Face-of-god:\n\n'Dawn is in the sky, Dalesman; there is yet time for thee to wash the\nnight off of thee in our bath of the Shivering Flood and to put thy\nmouth to the milk-bowl; but time for nought else:  for I and Bow-may\nare appointed thy fellows for the road, and it were well that we were\nback home speedily.'\n\nSo Face-of-god leapt up and went forth from the Hall, and Wood-wise\nled to where was a pool in the river with steps cut down to it in the\nrocky bank.\n\n'This,' said Wood-wise, 'is the Carle's Bath; but the Queen's is\nlower down, where the water is wider and shallower below the little\nmid-dale force.'\n\nSo Gold-mane stripped off his raiment and leapt into the ice-cold\npool; and they had brought his weapons and war-gear with them; so\nwhen he came out he clad and armed himself for the road, and then\nturned with Wood-wise toward the outgate of the Dale; and soon they\nsaw two men coming from lower down the water in such wise that they\nwould presently cross their path, and as yet it was little more than\ntwilight, so that they saw not at first who they were, but as they\ndrew nearer they knew them for the Sun-beam and Bow-may.  The Sun-\nbeam was clad but in her white linen smock and blue gown as he had\nfirst seen her, her hair was wet and dripping with the river, her\nface fresh and rosy:  she carried in her two hands a great bowl of\nmilk, and stepped delicately, lest she should spill it.  But Bow-may\nwas clad in her war-gear with helm and byrny, and a quiver at her\nback, and a bended bow in her hand.  So they greeted each other\nkindly, and the Sun-beam gave the bowl to Face-of-god and said:\n\n'Drink, guest, for thou hast a long and thirsty road before thee.'\n\nSo Face-of-god drank, and gave her the bowl back again, and she\nsmiled on him and drank, and the others after her till the bowl was\nempty:  then Bow-may put her hand on Wood-wise's shoulder, and they\nled on toward the outgate, while those twain followed them hand in\nhand.  But the Sun-beam said:\n\n'This then is the new day I spoke of, and lo! it bringeth our\nsundering with it; yet shall it be no longer than a day when all is\nsaid, and new days shall follow after.  And now, my friend, I shall\nsee thee no later than the April market; for doubt not that I shall\ngo thither with Folk-might, whether he will or not.  Also as I led\nthee out of the house when we last met, so shall I lead thee out of\nthe Dale to-day, and I will go with thee a little way on the waste;\nand therefore am I shod this morning, as thou seest, for the ways on\nthe waste are rough.  And now I bid thee have courage while my hand\nholdeth thine.  For afterwards I need not bid thee anything; for thou\nwilt have enough to do when thou comest to thy Folk, and must needs\nthink more of warriors then than of maidens.'\n\nHe looked at her and longed for her, but said soberly:  'Thou art\nkind, O friend, and thinkest kindly of me ever.  But methinks it were\nnot well done for thee to wend with me over a deal of the waste, and\ncome back by thyself alone, when ye have so many foemen nearby.'\n\n'Nay,' she said, 'they be nought so near as that yet, and I wot that\nFolk-might hath gone forth toward the north-west, where he looketh to\nfall in with a company of the foemen.  His battle shall be a guard\nunto us.'\n\n'I pray thee turn back at the top of the outgate,' said he, 'and be\nnot venturesome.  Thou wottest that the pitcher is not broken the\nfirst time it goeth to the well, nor maybe the twentieth, but at last\nit cometh not back.'\n\nShe said:  'Nevertheless I shall have my will herein.  And it is but\na little way I will wend with thee.'\n\nTherewith were they come to the scree, and talk fell down between\nthem as they clomb it; but when they were in the darksome passage of\nthe rocks, and could scarce see one another, Face-of-god said:\n\n'Where then is another outgate from the Dale?  Is it not up the\nwater?'\n\n'Yea,' she said, 'and there is none other:  at the lower end the\nrocks rise sheer from out the water, and a little further down is a\ngreat force thundering betwixt them; so that by no boat or raft may\nye come out of the Dale.  But the outgate up the water is called the\nRoad of War, as this is named the Path of Peace.  But now are all\nways ways of war.'\n\n'There is peace in my heart,' said Gold-mane.\n\nShe answered not for a while, but pressed his hand, and he felt her\nbreath on his cheek; and even therewithal they came out of the dark,\nand Gold-mane saw that her cheek was flushed; and now she spake:\n\n'One thing would I say to thee, my friend.  Thou hast seen me amongst\nmen of war, amongst outlaws who seek violence; thou hast heard me bid\nmy brother to count the slain, and I shrinking not; thou knowest (for\nI have told thee) how I have schemed and schemed for victorious\nbattle.  Yet I would not have thee think of me as a Chooser of the\nSlain, a warrior maiden, or as of one who hath no joy save in the\nbattle whereto she biddeth others.  O friend, the many peaceful hours\nthat I have had on the grass down yonder, sitting with my rock and\nspindle in hand, the children round about my knees hearkening to some\nold story so well remembered by me! or the milking of the kine in the\ndewy summer even, when all was still but for the voice of the water\nand the cries of the happy children, and there round about me were\nthe dear and beauteous maidens with whom I had grown up, happy amidst\nall our troubles, since their life was free and they knew no guile.\nIn such times my heart was at peace indeed, and it seemed to me as if\nwe had won all we needed; as if war and turmoil were over, after they\nhad brought about peace and good days for our little folk.\n\n'And as for the days that be, are they not as that rugged pass, full\nof bitter winds and the voice of hurrying waters, that leadeth yonder\nto Silver-dale, as thou hast divined? and there is nought good in it\nsave that the breath of life is therein, and that it leadeth to\npleasant places and the peace and plenty of the fair dale.'\n\n'Sweet friend,' he said, 'what thou sayest is better than well:  for\ntime shall be, if we come alive out of this pass of battle and bitter\nstrife, when I shall lead thee into Burgdale to dwell there.  And\nthou wottest of our people that there is little strife and grudging\namongst them, and that they are merry, and fair to look on, both men\nand women; and no man there lacketh what the earth may give us, and\nit is a saying amongst us that there may a man have that which he\ndesireth save the sun and moon in his hands to play with:  and of\nthis gladness, which is made up of many little matters, what story\nmay be told?  Yet amongst it shall I live and thou with me; and ill\nindeed it were if it wearied thee and thou wert ever longing for some\nday of victorious strife, and to behold me coming back from battle\nhigh-raised on the shields of men and crowned with bay; if thine ears\nmust ever be tickled with the talk of men and their songs concerning\nmy warrior deeds.  For thus it shall not be.  When I drive the herds\nit shall be at the neighbours' bidding whereso they will; not necks\nof men shall I smite, but the stalks of the tall wheat, and the boles\nof the timber-trees which the woodreeve hath marked for felling; the\nstilts of the plough rather than the hilts of the sword shall harden\nmy hands; my shafts shall be for the deer, and my spears for the\nwood-boar, till war and sorrow fall upon us, and I fight for the\nceasing of war and trouble.  And though I be called a chief and of\nthe blood of chiefs, yet shall I not be masterful to the goodman of\nthe Dale, but rather to my hound; for my chieftainship shall be that\nI shall be well beloved and trusted, and that no man shall grudge\nagainst me.  Canst thou learn to love such a life, which to me\nseemeth lovely?  And thou? of whom I say that thou art as if thou\nwert come down from the golden chairs of the Burg of the Gods.'\n\nThey were well-nigh out of the steep path by now, and the daylight\nwas bright about them; there she stayed her feet a moment and turned\nto him and said:\n\n'All this should I love even now, if the grief of our Folk were but\nhealed, and hereafter shall I learn yet more of thy well-beloved\nface.'\n\nTherewith she laid her face to his and kissed him fondly, and put his\nhand to her side and held it there, saying:  'Soon shall we be one in\nbody and in soul.'\n\nAnd he laughed with joy and pride of life, and took her hand and led\nher on again, and said:\n\n'Yet feel the cold rings of my hauberk, my friend; look at the spears\nthat cumber my hand, and at Dale-warden hanging by my side.  Thou\nshalt yet see me as the Slain's Chooser would see her speech-friend;\nfor there is much to do ere we win wheat-harvest in Burgdale.'\n\nTherewith they stepped together on to the level ground of the waste,\nand saw Bow-may sitting on a stone hard by, and Wood-wise standing\nbeside her bending his bow.  Bow-may smiled on Gold-mane and rose up,\nand they all went on together, turning so that they went nearly\nalongside the wall of the Vale, but westering a little; then the Sun-\nbeam said:\n\n'Many a time have I trodden this heath alongside our rock-wall; for\nif ye wend a little further as our faces are turned, ye come to the\ncrags over the place where the Shivering Flood goeth out of Shadowy\nVale.  There when ye have clomb a little may'st thou stand on the\nedge of the rock-wall, and look down and behold the Flood swirling\nand eddying in the black gorge of the rocks, and see presently the\nreek of the force go up, and hear the thunder of the waters as they\npour over it:  and all this about us now is as the garden of our\nhouse--is it not so, Bow-may?'\n\n'Yea,' said she, 'and there are goodly cluster-berries to be gotten\nhereabout in the autumn; many a time have the Sun-beam and I reddened\nour lips with them.  Yet is it best to be wary when war is abroad and\nhot withal.'\n\n'Yea,' said the Sun-beam, 'and all this place comes into the story of\nour House:  lo!  Gold-mane, two score paces before us a little on our\nright hand those five grey stones.  They are called the Rocks of the\nElders:  for there in the first days of our abiding in Shadowy Vale\nthe Elders were wont to come together to talk privily upon our\nmatters.'\n\nFace-of-god looked thither as she spoke, but therewith saw Bow-may,\nwho went on the left hand of the Sun-beam, as Face-of-god on her\nright hand, notch a shaft on her bent bow, and Wood-wise, who was on\nhis right hand, saw it also and did the like, and therewithal Face-\nof-god got his target on to his arm, and even as he did so Bow-may\ncried out suddenly:\n\n'Yea, yea!  Cast thyself on to the ground, Sun-beam!  Gold-mane,\ntarge and spear, targe and spear!  For I see steel gleaming yonder\nout from behind the Elders' Rocks.'\n\nScarce were the words out of her mouth ere three shafts came flying,\nand the bow-strings twanged.  Gold-mane felt that one smote his helm\nand glanced from it.  Therewithal he saw the Sun-beam fall to earth,\nthough he knew not if she had but cast herself down as Bow-may bade.\nBow-may's string twanged at once, and a yell came from the foemen:\nbut Wood-wise loosed not, but set his hand to his mouth and gave a\nloud wild cry--Ha! ha! ha! ha!  How-ow-ow!--ending in a long and\nexceeding great whoop like nought but the wolf's howl.  Now Gold-mane\nthinking swiftly, in a moment of time, as war-meet men do, judged\nthat if the Sun-beam were hurt (and she had made no cry), it were yet\nwiser to fall on the foe before turning to tend her, or else all\nmight be lost; so he rushed forward spear in hand and target on arm,\nand saw, as he opened up the flank of the Elders' Rocks, six men,\nwhereof one leaned aback on the rock with Bow-may's shaft in his\nshoulder, and two others were just in act of loosing at him.  In a\nmoment, as he rushed at them, one shaft went whistling by him, and\nthe other glanced from off his target; he cast a spear as he bounded\non, and saw it smite one of the shooters full in the naked face, and\nsaw the blood spout out and change his face and the man roll over,\nand then in another moment four men were hewing at him with their\nshort steel axes.  He thrust out his target against them, and then\nlet the weight of his body come on his other spear, and drave it\nthrough the second shooter's throat, and even therewith was smitten\non the helm so hard that, though the Alderman's work held out, he\nfell to his knees, holding his target over his head and striving to\ndraw forth Dale-warden; in that nick of time a shaft whistled close\nby his ear, and as he rose to his feet again he saw his foeman\nrolling over and over, clutching at the ling with both hands.  Then\nrang out again the terrible wolf-whoop from Wood-wise's mouth, and\nboth he and Bow-may loosed a shaft, for the two other foes had turned\ntheir backs and were fleeing fast.  Again Bow-may hit the clout, and\nthe Dusky Man fell dead at once, but Wood-wise's arrow flew over the\nfelon's shoulder as he ran.  Then in a trice was Gold-mane bounding\nafter him like the hare just roused from her form; for it came into\nhis head that these felons had beheld them coming up out of the Vale,\nand that if even this one man escaped, he would bring his company\ndown upon the Vale-dwellers.\n\nStrong and light-foot as any was Face-of-god, and though he was\ncumbered with his hauberk, yet was Iron-face's handiwork far lighter\nthan the war-coat of the Dusky Man, and the race was soon over.  The\nfelon turned breathless to meet Gold-mane, who drave his target\nagainst him and cast him to earth, and as he strove to rise smote off\nhis head at one stroke; for Dale-warden was a good sword and the\nDalesman as fierce of mood as might be.  There he let the felon lie,\nand, turning, walked back swiftly toward the Elders' Rocks, and found\nthere Wood-wise and the dead foemen, for the carle had slain the\nwounded, and he was now drawing the silver arm-rings off the slain\nmen; for all these Dusky Felons bore silver arm-rings.  But Bow-may\nwas walking towards the Sun-beam, and thitherward followed Gold-mane\nspeedily.\n\nHe found her sitting on a tussock of grass close by where she had\nfallen, her face pale, her eyes eager and gleaming; she looked up at\nhim as he drew nigher and said:\n\n'Friend, art thou hurt?'\n\n'Nay,' he said, 'and thou?  Thou art pale.'\n\n'I am not hurt,' she said.  Then she smiled and said again:\n\n'Did I not tell thee that I am no warrior like Bow-may here?  Such\ndeeds make maidens pale.'\n\nSaid Bow-may:  'If ye will have the truth, Gold-mane, she is not wont\nto grow pale when battle is nigh her.  Look you, she hath had the\ngift of a new delight, and findeth it sweeter and softer than she had\nany thought of; and now hath she feared lest it should be taken from\nher.'\n\n'Bow-may saith but the sooth,' said the Sun-beam simply, 'and kind it\nis of her to say it.  I saw thee, Bow-may, and good was thy shooting,\nand I love thee for it.'\n\nSaid Bow-may:  'I never shoot otherwise than well.  But those idle\nshooters of the Dusky Ones, whereabouts nigh to thee went their\nshafts?'\n\nSaid the Sun-beam:  'One just lifted the hair by my left ear, and\nthat was not so ill-aimed; as for the other, it pierced my raiment by\nmy right knee, and pinned me to the earth, so that I tottered and\nfell, and my gown and smock are grievously wounded, both of them.'\n\nAnd she took the folds of the garments in her hands to show the rents\ntherein; and her colour was come again, and she was glad.\n\n'What were best to do now?' she said.\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'Let us tarry a little; for some of thy carles\nshall surely come up from the Vale:  because they will have heard\nWood-wise's whoop, since the wind sets that way.'\n\n'Yea, they will come,' said the Sun-beam.\n\n'Good is that,' said Face-of-god; 'for they shall take the dead\nfelons and cast them where they be not seen if perchance any more\nstray hereby.  For if they wind them, they may well happen on the\npath down to the Vale.  Also, my friend, it were well if thou wert to\nbid a good few of the carles that are in the Vale to keep watch and\nward about here, lest there be more foemen wandering about the\nwaste.'\n\nShe said:  'Thou art wise in war, Gold-mane; I will do as thou\nbiddest me.  But soothly this is a perilous thing that the Dusky Men\nare gotten so close to the Vale.'\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'This will Folk-might look to when he cometh home;\nand it is most like that he will deem it good to fall on them\nsomewhere a good way aloof, so as to draw them off from wandering\nover the waste.  Also I will do my best to busy them when I am home\nin Burgdale.'\n\nTherewith came up Wood-wise, and fell to talk with them; and his mind\nit was that these foemen were but a band of strayers, and had had no\ninkling of Shadowy Vale till they had heard them talking together as\nthey came up the path from the Vale, and that then they had made that\nambush behind the Elders' Rocks, so that they might slay the men, and\nthen bear off the woman.  He said withal that it would be best to\ncarry their corpses further on, so that they might be cast over the\ncliffs into the fierce stream of the Shivering Flood.\n\nAmidst this talk came up men from the Vale, a score of them, well\narmed; and they ran to meet the wayfarers; and when they heard what\nhad befallen, they rejoiced exceedingly, and were above all glad that\nFace-of-god had shown himself doughty and deft; and they deemed his\nrede wise, to set a watch thereabouts till Folk-might came home, and\nsaid that they would do even so.\n\nThen spake the Sun-beam and said:\n\n'Now must ye wayfarers depart; for the road is but rough, and the day\nnot over-long.'\n\nThen she turned to Face-of-god and put her hand on his shoulder, and\nbrought her face close to his and spake to him softly:\n\n'Doth this second parting seem at all strange to thee, and that I am\nnow so familiar to thee, I whom thou didst once deem to be a very\ngoddess?  And now thou hast seen me redden before thine eyes because\nof thee; and thou hast seen me grow pale with fear because of thee;\nand thou hast felt my caresses which I might not refrain; even as if\nI were altogether such a maiden as ye warriors hang about for a nine\ndays' wonder, and then all is over save an aching heart--wilt thou do\nso with me?  Tell me, have I not belittled myself before thee as if I\nasked thee to scorn me?  For thus desire dealeth both with maid and\nman.'\n\nHe said:  'In all this there is but one thing for me to say, and that\nis that I love thee; and surely none the less, but rather the more,\nbecause thou lovest me, and art of my kind, and mayest share in my\ndeeds and think well of them.  Now is my heart full of joy, and one\nthing only weigheth on it; and that is that my kinswoman the Bride\nbegrudgeth our love together.  For this is the thing that of all\nthings most misliketh me, that any should bear a grudge against me.'\n\nShe said:  'Forget not the token, and my message to her.'\n\n'I will not forget it,' said he.  'And now I bid thee to kiss me even\nbefore all these that are looking on; for there is nought to belittle\nus therein, since we be troth-plight.'\n\nAnd indeed those folk stood all round about them gazing on them, but\na little aloof, that they might not hear their words if they were\nminded to talk privily.  For they had long loved the Sun-beam, and\nnow the love of Face-of-god had begun to spring up in their hearts.\n\nSo the twain embraced and kissed one another, and made no haste\nthereover; and those men deemed that but meet and right, and clashed\ntheir weapons on their shields in token of their joy.\n\nThen Face-of-god turned about and strode out of the ring of men, with\nBow-may and Wood-wise beside him, and they went on their journey over\nthe necks towards Burgstead.  But the Sun-beam turned slowly from\nthat place toward the Vale, and two of the stoutest carles went along\nwith her to guard her from harm, and she went down into the Vale\npondering all these things in her heart.\n\nThen the other carles dragged off the corpses of the Dusky Men till\nthey had brought them to the sheer rocks above the Shivering Flood,\nand there they tossed them over into the boiling caldron of the\nforce, and so departed taking with them the silver arm-rings of the\nslain to add to the tale.\n\nBut when they came back into the Vale the Sun-beam duly ordered that\nwatch and ward to keep the ingate thereto, and note all that should\nbefall till Folk-might came home.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.  FACE-OF-GOD COMETH HOME TO BURGSTEAD\n\n\n\nBut Face-of-god with Bow-may and Wood-wise fared over the waste,\ngoing at first alongside the cliffs of the Shivering Flood, and then\nafterwards turning somewhat to the west.  They soon had to climb a\nvery high and steep bent going up to a mountain-neck; and the way\nover the neck was rough indeed when they were on it, and they toiled\nout of it into a barren valley, and out of the valley again on to a\nrough neck; and such-like their journey the day long, for they were\ngoing athwart all those great dykes that went from the ice-mountains\ntoward the lower dales like the outspread fingers of a hand or the\nroots of a great tree.  And the ice-mountains they had on their left\nhands and whiles at their backs.\n\nThey went very warily, with their bows bended and spear in hand, but\nsaw no man, good or bad, and but few living things.  At noon they\nrested in a valley where was a stream, but no grass, nought but\nstones and sand; but where they were at least sheltered from the\nwind, which was mostly very great in these high wastes; and there\nBow-may drew meat and wine from a wallet she bore, and they ate and\ndrank, and were merry enough; and Bow-may said:\n\n'I would I were going all the way with thee, Gold-mane; for I long\nsore to let my eyes rest a while on the land where I shall one day\nlive.'\n\n'Yea,' said Face-of-god, 'art thou minded to dwell there?  We shall\nbe glad of that.'\n\n'Whither are thy wits straying?' said she; 'whether I am minded to it\nor not, I shall dwell there.'\n\nAnd Wood-wise nodded a yea to her.  But Face-of-god said:\n\n'Good will be thy dwelling; but wherefore must it be so?'\n\nThen Wood-wise laughed and said:  'I shall tell thee in fewer words\nthan she will, and time presses now:  Wood-father and Wood-mother,\nand I and my two brethren and this woman have ever been about and\nanigh the Sun-beam; and we deem that war and other troubles have made\nus of closer kin to her than we were born, whether ye call it\nbrotherhood or what not, and never shall we sunder from her in life\nor in death.  So when thou goest to Burgdale with her, there shall we\nbe.'\n\nThen was Face-of-god glad when he found that they deemed his wedding\nso settled and sure; but Wood-wise fell to making ready for the road.\nAnd Face-of-god said to him:\n\n'Tell me one thing, Wood-wise; that whoop that thou gavest forth when\nwe were at handy-strokes e'en now--is it but a cry of thine own or is\nit of thy Folk, and shall I hear it again?'\n\n'Thou may'st look to hear it many a time,' said Wood-wise, 'for it is\nthe cry of the Wolf.  Seldom indeed hath battle been joined where men\nof our blood are, but that cry is given forth.  Come now, to the\nroad!'\n\nSo they went their ways and the road worsened upon them, and toilsome\nwas the climbing up steep bents and the scaling of doubtful paths in\nthe cliff-sides, so that the journey, though the distance of it were\nnot so long to the fowl flying, was much eked out for them, and it\nwas not till near nightfall that they came on the ghyll of the\nWeltering Water some six miles above Burgstead.  Forsooth Wood-wise\nsaid that the way might be made less toilsome though far longer by\nturning back eastward a little past the vale where they had rested at\nmidday; and that seemed good to Gold-mane, in case they should be\nwending hereafter in a great company between Burgdale and Shadowy\nVale.\n\nBut now those two went with Face-of-god down a path in the side of\nthe cliff whereby him-seemed he had gone before; and they came down\ninto the ghyll and sat down together on a stone by the water-side,\nand Face-of-god spake to them kindly, for he deemed them good and\ntrusty faring-fellows.\n\n'Bow-may,' said he, 'thou saidst a while ago that thou wouldst be\nfain to look on Burgdale; and indeed it is fair and lovely, and ye\nmay soon be in it if ye will.  Ye shall both be more than welcome to\nthe house of my father, and heartily I bid you thither.  For night is\non us, and the way back is long and toilsome and beset with peril.\nSister Bow-may, thou wottest that it would be a sore grief to me if\nthou camest to any harm, and thou also, fellow Wood-wise.  Daylight\nis a good faring-fellow over the waste.'\n\nSaid Bow-may:  'Thou art kind, Gold-mane, and that is thy wont, I\nknow; and fain were I to-night of the candles in thine hall.  But we\nmay not tarry; for thou wottest how busy we be at home; and Sun-beam\nneedeth me, if it were only to make her sure that no Dusky Man is\nbearing off thine head by its lovely locks.  Neither shall we journey\nin the mirk night; for look you, the moon yonder.'\n\n'Well,' said Face-of-god, 'parting is ill at the best, and I would I\ncould give you twain a gift, and especially to thee, my sister Bow-\nmay.'\n\nSaid Wood-wise:  'Thou may'st well do that; or at least promise the\ngift; and that is all one as if we held it in our hands.'\n\n'Yea,' said Bow-may, 'Wood-wise and I have been thinking in one way\nbelike; and I was at point to ask a gift of thee.'\n\n'What is it?' said Gold-mane.  'Surely it is thine, if it were but a\nguerdon for thy good shooting.'\n\nShe laughed and handled the skirts of his hauberk as she said:\n\n'Show us the dint in thine helm that the steel axe made this\nmorning.'\n\n'There is no such great dint,' said he; 'my father forged that helm,\nand his work is better than good.'\n\n'Yea,' said Bow-may, 'and might I have hauberk and helm of his\nhandiwork, and Wood-wise a good sword of the same, then were I a glad\nwoman, and this man a happy carle.'\n\nSaid Gold-mane:  'I am well pleased at thine asking, and so shall\nIron-face be when he heareth of thine archery; and how that Hall-face\nwere now his only son but for thy close shooting.  But now must I to\nthe way; for my heart tells me that there may have been tidings in\nBurgstead this while I have been aloof.'\n\nSo they rose all three, and Bow-may said:\n\n'Thou art a kind brother, and soon shall we meet again; and that will\nbe well.'\n\nThen he put his hands on her shoulders and kissed both her cheeks;\nand he kissed Wood-wise, and turned and went his ways, threading the\nstony tangle about the Weltering Water, which was now at middle\nheight, and running clear and strong; so turning once he beheld Wood-\nwise and Bow-may climbing the path up the side of the ghyll, and Bow-\nmay turned to him also and waved her bow as token of farewell.  Then\nhe went upon his way, which was rough enough to follow by night,\nthough the moon was shining brightly high aloft.  Yet as he knew his\nroad he made but little of it all, and in somewhat more than an hour\nand a half was come out of the pass into the broken ground at the\nhead of the Dale, and began to make his way speedily under the bright\nmoonlight toward the Gate, still going close by the water.  But as he\nwent he heard of a sudden cries and rumour not far from him, unwonted\nin that place, where none dwelt, and where the only folk he might\nlook to see were those who cast an angle into the pools and eddies of\nthe Water.  Moreover, he saw about the place whence came the cries\ntorches moving swiftly hither and thither; so that he looked to hear\nof new tidings, and stayed his feet and looked keenly about him on\nevery side; and just then, between his rough path and the shimmer of\nthe dancing moonlit water, he saw the moon smite on something\ngleaming; so, as quietly as he could, he got his target on his arm,\nand shortened his spear in his right hand, and then turned sharply\ntoward that gleam.  Even therewith up sprang a man on his right hand,\nand then another in front of him just betwixt him and the water; an\naxe gleamed bright in the moon, and he caught a great stroke on his\ntarget, and therewith drave his left shoulder straight forward, so\nthat the man before him fell over into the water with a mighty\nsplash; for they were at the very edge of the deepest eddy of the\nWater.  Then he spun round on his heel, heeding not that another\nstroke had fallen on his right shoulder, yet ill-aimed, and not with\nthe full edge, so that it ran down his byrny and rent it not.  So he\nsent the thrust of his spear crashing through the face and skull of\nthe smiter, and looked not to him as he fell, but stood still,\nbrandishing his spear and crying out, 'For the Burg and the Face!\nFor the Burg and the Face!'\n\nNo other foe came against him, but like to the echo of his cry rose a\nclear shout not far aloof, 'For the Face, for the Face!  For the Burg\nand the Face!'  He muttered, 'So ends the day as it begun,' and\nshouted loud again, 'For the Burg and the Face!'  And in a minute\nmore came breaking forth from the stone-heaps into the moonlit space\nbefore the water the tall shapes of the men of Burgstead, the red\ntorchlight and the moonlight flashing back from their war-gear and\nweapons; for every man had his sword or spear in hand.\n\nHall-face was the first of them, and he threw his arms about his\nbrother and said:  'Well met, Gold-mane, though thou comest amongst\nus like Stone-fist of the Mountain.  Art thou hurt?  With whom hast\nthou dealt?  Where be they?  Whence comest thou?'\n\n'Nay, I am not hurt,' said Face-of-god.  'Stint thy questions then,\ntill thou hast told me whom thou seekest with spear and sword and\ncandle.'\n\n'Two felons were they,' said Hall-face, 'even such as ye saw lying\ndead at Wood-grey's the other day.'\n\n'Then may ye sheathe your swords and go home,' said Gold-mane, 'for\none lieth at the bottom of the eddy, and the other, thy feet are\nwell-nigh treading on him, Hall-face.'\n\nThen arose a rumour of praise and victory, and they brought the\ntorches nigh and looked at the fallen man, and found that he was\nstark dead; so they even let him lie there till the morrow, and all\nturned about toward the Thorp; and many looked on Face-of-god and\nwondered concerning him, whence he was and what had befallen him.\nIndeed, they would have asked him thereof, but could not get at him\nto ask; but whoso could, went as nigh to Hall-face and him as they\nmight, to hearken to the talk between the brothers.\n\nSo as they went along Hall-face did verily ask him whence he came:\n'For was it not so,' said he, 'that thou didst enter into the wood\nseeking some adventure early in the morning the day before\nyesterday?'\n\n'Sooth is that,' said Face-of-god, 'and I came to Shadowy Vale, and\nthence am I come this morning.'\n\nSaid Hall-face:  'I know not Shadowy Vale, nor doth any of us.  This\nis a new word.  How say ye, friends, doth any man here know of\nShadowy Vale?'\n\nThey all said, 'Nay.'\n\nThen said Hall-face:  'Hast thou been amongst mere ghosts and\nmarvels, brother, or cometh this tale of thy minstrelsy?'\n\n'For all your words,' said Gold-mane, 'to that Vale have I been; and,\nto speak shortly (for I desire to have your tale, and am waiting for\nit), I will tell thee that I found there no marvels or strange\nwights, but a folk of valiant men; a folk small in numbers, but great\nof heart; a folk come, as we be, from the Fathers and the Gods.  And\nthis, moreover, is to be said of them, that they are the foes of\nthese felons of whom ye were chasing these twain.  And these same\nDusky Men of Silver-dale would slay them every man if they might; and\nif we look not to it they will soon be doing the same by us; for they\nare many, and as venomous as adders, as fierce as bears, and as foul\nas swine.  But these valiant men, who bear on their banner the image\nof the Wolf, should be our fellows in arms, and they have good will\nthereto; and they shall show us the way to Silver-dale by blind\npaths, so that we may fall upon these felons while they dwell there\ntormenting the poor people of the land, and thus may we destroy them\nas lads a hornet's nest.  Or else the days shall be hard for us.'\n\nThe men who hung about them drank in his words greedily.  But Hall-\nface was silent a little while, and then he said:  'Brother Gold-\nmane, these be great tidings.  Time was when we might have deemed\nthem but a minstrel's tale; for Silver-dale we know not, of which\nthou speakest so glibly, nor the Dusky Men, any more than the Shadowy\nVale.  Howbeit, things have befallen these two last days so strange\nand new, that putting them together with the murder at Wood-grey's,\nand thy words which seem somewhat wild, it may well seem to us that\ntidings unlooked for are coming our way.'\n\n'Come, then,' said Face-of-god, 'give me what thou hast in thy scrip,\nand trust me, I shall not jeer at thy tale.'\n\nSaid Hall-face:  'I also will be short with the tale; and that the\nmore, as meseemeth it is not yet done, and that thou thyself shalt\nshare in the ending of it.  It was the day before yesterday, that is\nthe day when thou departedst into the woods on that adventure whereof\nthou shalt one day tell me more, wilt thou not?'\n\n'Yea, in good time,' said Face-of-god.\n\n'Well,' quoth Hall-face, 'we went into the woods that day and in the\nmorning, but after sunrise, to the number of a score:  we looked to\nmeet a bear and a she-bear with cubs in a certain place; for one of\nthe Woodlanders, a keen hunter, had told us of their lair.  Also we\nwere wishful to slay some of the wild-swine, the yearlings, if we\nmight.  Therefore, though we had no helms or shields or coats of\nfence, we had bowshot a plenty, and good store of casting-weapons,\nbesides our wood-knives and an axe or so; and some of us, of whom I\nwas one, bore our battle-swords, as we are wont ever to do, be the\nfoe beast or man.\n\n'Thus armed we went up Wildlake's Way and came to Carlstead, where\nhalf-a-score Woodlanders joined themselves to us, so that we became a\nband.  We went up the half-cleared places past Carlstead for a mile,\nand then turned east into the wood, and went I know not how far, for\nthe Woodlanders led us by crooked paths, but two hours wore away in\nour going, till we came to the place where they looked to find the\nbears.  It is a place that may well be noted, for it is unlike the\nwood round about.  There is a close thicket some two furlongs about\nof thorn and briar and ill-grown ash and oak and other trees, planted\nby the birds belike; and it stands as it were in an island amidst of\na wide-spreading woodlawn of fine turf, set about in the most goodly\nfashion with great tall straight-boled oak-trees, that seem to have\nbeen planted of set purpose by man's hand.  Yea, dost thou know the\nplace?'\n\n'Methinks I do,' said Gold-mane, 'and I seem to have heard the\nWoodlanders give it a name and call it Boars-bait.'\n\n'That may be,' said Hall-face.  'Well, there we were, the dogs and\nthe men, and we drew nigh the thicket and beset it, and doubted not\nto find prey therein:  but when we would set the dogs at the thicket\nto enter it, they were uneasy, and would not take up the slot, but\ngrowled and turned about this way and that, so that we deemed that\nthey winded some fierce beast at our flanks or backs.\n\n'Even so it was, and fierce enough and deadly was the beast; for\nsuddenly we heard bow-strings twang, and shafts came flying; and\nIron-shield of the Upper Dale, who was close beside me, leapt up into\nthe air and fell down dead with an arrow through his back.  Then I\nbethought me in the twinkling of an eye, and I cried out, \"The foe\nare on us! take the cover of the tree-boles and be wary!  For the\nBurg and the Face!  For the Burg and the Face!\"\n\n'So we scattered and covered ourselves with the oak-boles, but\nbesides Iron-shield, who was slain outright, two goodmen were sorely\nhurt, to wit Bald-face, a man of our house, and Stonyford of the\nLower Dale.\n\n'I looked from behind my tree-bole, a great one; and far off down the\nglades I saw men moving, clad in gay raiment; but nearer to me, not a\nhundred yards from my cover, I saw an arm clad in scarlet come out\nfrom behind a tree-bole, so I loosed at it, and missed not; for\nstraight there tottered out from behind the tree one of those dusky\nfoul-favoured men like to those that were slain by Wood-grey.  I had\nanother shaft ready notched, so I loosed and set the shaft in his\nthroat, and he fell.\n\n'Straightway was a yelling and howling about us like the cries of\nscalded curs, and the oak-wood swarmed thick with these felons\nrushing on us; for it seems that the man whom I had slain was a chief\namongst them, or we judged so by his goodly raiment.\n\n'Methought then our last day was come.  What could we do but run\ntogether again after we had loosed at a venture, and so withstand\nthem sword and spear in hand?  Some fell beneath our shot, but not\nmany, for they came on very swiftly.\n\n'So they fell on us; but for all their fierceness and their numbers\nthey might not break our array, and we slew four and hurt many by\nsword-hewing and spear-casting and push of spear; and five of us were\nhurt and one slain by their dart-casting.  So they drew off from us a\nlittle, and strove to spread out and fall to shooting at us again;\nbut this we would not suffer, but pushed on as they fell back,\nkeeping as close together as we might for the trees.  For we said\nthat we would all die together if needs must; and verily the stour\nwas hard.\n\n'Yet hearken!  In that nick of time rose up a strange cry not far\nfrom us, Ha! ha! ha! ha!  How-ow-ow! ending like the howl of a wolf,\nand then another and another and another, till the whole wood rang\nagain.\n\n'At first we deemed that here were come fresh foemen, and that we\nwere undone indeed; but when they heard it, the foe-men before us\nfaltered and gave way, and at last turned their backs and fled, and\nwe followed, keeping well together still:  thereby the more part of\nthese men escaped us, for they fled wildly here and there from those\nwho bore that cry with them; so we knew that our work was being done\nfor us; therefore we stood, and saw tall men clad in sheep-brown weed\nrunning through the glades pursuing those felons and smiting them\ndown, till both fleers and pursuers passed out of our sight like men\nin a dream, or as when ye roll up a pictured cloth to lay it in the\ncoffer.\n\n'But to Stone-face's mind those brown-clad men were the Wights of the\nWood that be of the Fathers' blood, and our very friends; and when\nsome of us would yet have gone forward and foregathered with them,\nand followed the chase along with them, Stone-face gainsaid it,\nbidding us not to run into the arms of a second death, when we had\nbut just escaped from the first.  Sooth to say, moreover, we had\ndivers hurt men that needed looking to.\n\n'So what with one thing, what with another, we turned back:  but War-\ncliff's brother, a tall man, had felled two of those felons with an\noak sapling which he had torn from the thicket; but he had not slain\nthem, and by now they were just awakening from their swoon, and were\nsitting up looking round them with fierce rolling eyes, expecting the\nstroke, for Raven of Longscree was standing over them with a naked\nwar-sword in his hand.  But now that our blood was cool, we were loth\nto slay them as they lay in our hands; so we bound them and brought\nthem away with us; and our own dead we carried also on such biers as\nwe might lightly make there, and with them three that were so\ngrievously hurt that they might not go afoot, these we left at\nCarlstead:  they were Tardy the Son of the Untamed, and Swan of Bull-\nmeadow, both of the Lower Dale, and a Woodlander, Undoomed to wit.\nBut the dead were Iron-shield aforesaid, and Wool-sark, and the\nHewer, a Woodlander.\n\n'So came we sadly at eventide to Burgstead with the two dead\nBurgdalers, and the captive felons, and the wounded of us that might\ngo afoot; and ye may judge that they of Burgdale and our father\ndeemed these tidings great enough, and wotted not what next should\nbefall.  Stone-face would have had those two felons slain there and\nthen; for no true tale could we get out of them, nor indeed any word\nat all.  But the Alderman would not have it so; and he deemed they\nmight serve our turn as hostages if any of our folk should be taken:\nfor one and all we deemed, and still deem, that war is on us and that\nnew folk have gathered on our skirts.\n\n'So the captives were shut up in the red out-bower of our house; and\nour father was minded that thou mightest tell us somewhat of them\nwhen thou wert come home.  But about dusk to-day the word went that\nthey had broken out and gotten them weapons and fled up the Dale; and\nso it was.\n\n'But to-morrow morning will a Gate-thing be holden, and there it will\nbe looked for of thee that thou tell us a true tale of thy goings.\nFor it is deemed, and it is my deeming especially, that thou may'st\ntell us more of these men than thou hast yet told us.  Is it not so?'\n\n'Yea, surely,' said Gold-mane, 'I can make as many words as ye will\nabout it; yet when all is said, it will come to much the same tale as\nI have already told thee.  Yet belike, if ye are minded to take up\nthe sword to defend you, I may tell you in what wise to lay hold on\nthe hilts.'\n\n'And that is well,' said Hall-face, 'and no less do I look for of\nthee.  But lo! here are we come to the Gate of the Burg that abideth\nbattle.'\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.  TALK IN THE HALL OF THE HOUSE OF THE FACE\n\n\n\nIn sooth they were come to the very Gate of Burgstead, and the great\ngates were shut, and only a wicket was open, and a half score of\nstout men in all their war-gear were holding ward thereby.  They gave\nplace to Hall-face and his company, albeit some of the warders\nfollowed them through the wicket that they might hear the story told.\n\nThe street was full of folk, both men and women, talking together\neagerly concerning all these tidings, and when they saw the men of\nthe Hue-and-cry they came thronging about them, so that they might\nscarce get to the door of the House of the Face because of the press;\nso Hall-face (who was a very tall man) cried out:\n\n'Good people, all is well! the runaways are slain, and Face-of-god is\ncome back with us; give place a little, that we may come into our\nhouse.'\n\nThen the throng set up a shout, and made way a little, so that Hall-\nface and Gold-mane and the others could get to the door.  And they\nentered into the Hall, and saw much folk therein; and men were\nsitting at table, for supper was not yet over.  But when they saw the\nnew-comers they mostly rose up from the board and stood silent to\nhear the tale, for they had been talking many together each to each,\nso that the Hall was full of confused noise.\n\nSo Hall-face again cried out:  'Men in this hall, good is the\ntidings.  The runaways are slain; and it was Face-of-god who slew\nthem as he came back safe from the waste.'\n\nThen they shouted for joy, and the brethren and Stone-face with them\n(for he had entered with them from the street) went up on to the\ndais, while the others of the Hue-and-cry gat them seats where they\nmight at the endlong tables.\n\nBut when Face-of-god came up on to the dais, there sat Iron-face\nlooking down on the thronged Hall with a ruddy cheerful countenance,\nand beside him sat the Bride; for he had caused her to be brought\nthither when he had heard of the tidings of battle.  She was daintily\nclad in a flame-coloured kirtle embroidered with gold about the bosom\nand sleeves, and there was a fillet of golden roses on her ruddy\nhair.  Her eyes shone bright and eager, and the pommels of her cheeks\nwere flushed and red contrary to their wont.  Needs must Gold-mane\nsit by her, and when he came close to her he knew not what to do, but\nhe put forth his hand to her, yet with a troubled countenance; for he\nfeared her grief mingled with her beauty:  as for her, she wavered in\nher mind whether she should forbear to touch him or not; but she saw\nthat men about were looking at them, and especially was Iron-face\nlooking on her:  therefore she stood up and took Gold-mane's hand and\nkissed his face as she had been wont to do, and by then was her face\nas white as paper; and her anguish pierced his heart, so that he\nwell-nigh groaned for grief of her.  But Iron-face looked on her and\nsaid kindly:\n\n'Kinswoman, thou art pale; thou hast feared for thy mate amidst all\nthese tidings of war, and still fearest for him.  But pluck up a\nheart; for the man is a deft warrior for all his fair face, which\nthou lovest as a woman should, and his hands may yet save his head.\nAnd if he be slain, yet are there other men of the kindred, and the\nearth will not be a desert to thee even then.'\n\nShe looked at Iron-face, and the colour was come back to her face\nsomewhat, and she said:\n\n'It is true; I have feared for him; for he goeth into perilous\nplaces.  But for thee, thou art kind, and I thank thee for it.'\n\nAnd therewith she kissed Iron-face and sat down in her place, and\nstrove to overmaster her grief, that her face might not be changed by\nit; for now were thoughts of battle, and valiant hopes arising in\nmen's hearts; and it seemed to her too grievous if she should mar\nthat feast on the eve of battle.\n\nBut Iron-face kissed and embraced his son and said:  'Art thou late\ncome from the waste?  Hast thou seen new things?  We look to have a\nnotable tale from thee; though here also have been tidings, and it is\nnot unlike that we shall presently have new work on our hands.'\n\n'Father,' quoth Face-of-god, 'I deem that when thou hast heard my\ntale thou wilt think no less of it than that there are valiant folk\nto be holpen, poor folk to be delivered, and evil folk to be swept\nfrom off the face of the earth.'\n\n'It is well, son,' said Iron-face.  'I see that thy tale is long; let\nit alone for to-night.  To-morrow shall we hold a Gate-thing, and\nthen shall we hear all that thou hast to tell.  Now eat thy meat and\ndrink a bowl of wine, and comfort thy troth-plight maiden.'\n\nSo Gold-mane sat down by the Bride, and ate and drank as he needs\nmust; but he was ill at ease and he durst not speak to her.  For, on\nthe one hand, he thought concerning his love for the Sun-beam, and\nhow sweet and good a thing it was that she should take him by the\nhand and lead him into noble deeds and great fame, caressing him so\nsoftly and sweetly the while; and, on the other hand, there sat the\nBride beside him, sorrowful and angry, begrudging all that sweetness\nof love, as though it were something foul and unseemly; and heavy on\nhim lay the weight of that grudge, for he was a man of a friendly\nheart.\n\nStone-face sat outward from him on the other side of the Bride; and\nhe leaned across her towards Gold-mane and said:\n\n'Fair shall be thy tale to-morrow, if thou tellest us all thine\nadventure.  Or wilt thou tell us less than all?'\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'In good time shalt thou know it all, foster-\nfather; but it is not unlike that by the time that thou hast heard\nit, there shall be so many other things to tell of, that my tale\nshall seem of little account to thee--even as the saw saith that one\nnail driveth out the other.'\n\n'Yea,' said Stone-face, 'but one tale belike shall be knit up with\nthe others, as it fareth with the figures that come one after other\non the weaver's cloth; though one maketh not the other, yet one\ncometh of the other.'\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'Wise art thou now, foster-father, but thou shalt\nbe wiser yet in this matter by then a month hath worn:  and to-morrow\nshalt thou know enough to set thine hands a-work.'\n\nSo the talk fell between them; and the night wore, and the men of\nBurgdale feasted in their ancient hall with merry hearts, little\nweighed down by thought of the battle that might be and the trouble\nto come; for they were valorous and kindly folk.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.  FACE-OF-GOD GIVETH THAT TOKEN TO THE BRIDE\n\n\n\nNow on the morrow, when Face-of-god arose and other men with him, and\nthe Hall was astir and there was no little throng therein, the Bride\ncame up to him; for she had slept in the House of the Face by the\nbidding of the Alderman; and she spake to him before all men, and\nbade him come forth with her into the garden, because she would speak\nto him apart.  He yeasaid her, though with a heavy heart; and to the\nfolk about that seemed meet and due, since those twain were deemed to\nbe troth-plight, and they smiled kindly on them as they went out of\nthe Hall together.\n\nSo they came into the garden, where the pear-trees were blossoming\nover the spring lilies, and the cherries were showering their flowers\non the deep green grass, and everything smelled sweetly on the warm\nwindless spring morning.\n\nShe led the way, going before him till they came by a smooth grass\npath between the berry bushes, to a square space of grass about which\nwere barberry trees, their first tender leaves bright green in the\nsun against the dry yellowish twigs.  There was a sundial amidmost of\nthe grass, and betwixt the garden-boughs one could see the long grey\nroof of the ancient hall; and sweet familiar sounds of the nesting\nbirds and men and women going on their errands were all about in the\nscented air.  She turned about at the sundial and faced Face-of-god,\nher hand lightly laid on the scored brass, and spake with no anger in\nher voice:\n\n'I ask thee if thou hast brought me the token whereon thou shalt\nswear to give me that gift.'\n\n'Yea,' said he; and therewith drew the ring from his bosom, and held\nit out to her.  She reached out her hand to him slowly and took it,\nand their fingers met as she did so, and he noted that her hand was\nwarm and firm and wholesome as he well remembered it.\n\nShe said:  'Whence hadst thou this fair finger-ring?'\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'My friend there in the mountain-valley drew it\nfrom off her finger for thee, and bade me bear thee a message.'\n\nHer face flushed red:  'Yea,' she said, 'and doth she send me a\nmessage?  Then doth she know of me, and ye have talked of me\ntogether.  Well, give the message!'\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'She saith, that thou shalt bear in mind, That to-\nmorrow is a new day.'\n\n'Yea,' she said, 'for her it is so, and for thee; but not for me.\nBut now I have brought thee here that thou mightest swear thine oath\nto me; lay thine hand on this ring and on this brazen plate whereby\nthe sun measures the hours of the day for happy folk, and swear by\nthe spring-tide of the year and all glad things that find a mate, and\nby the God of the Earth that rejoiceth in the life of man.'\n\nThen he laid his hand on the finger-ring as it lay on the dial-plate\nand said:\n\n'By the spring-tide and the live things that long to multiply their\nkind; by the God of the Earth that rejoiceth in the life of man, I\nswear to give to my kinswoman the Bride the second man-child that I\nbeget; to be hers, to leave or cherish, to love or hate, as her will\nmay bid her.'  Then he looked on her soberly and said:  'It is duly\nsworn; is it enough?'\n\n'Yea,' she said; but he saw how the tears ran out of her eyes and\nwetted the bosom of her kirtle, and she hung her head for shame of\nher grief.  And Gold-mane was all abashed, and had no word to say;\nfor he knew that no word of his might comfort her; and he deemed it\nill done to stay there and behold her sorrow; and he knew not how to\nget him gone, and be glad elsewhere, and leave her alone.\n\nThen, as if she had read his thought, she looked up at him and said\nsmiling a little amidst of her tears:\n\n'I bid thee stay by me till the flood is over; for I have yet a word\nto say to thee.'\n\nSo he stood there gazing down on the grass in his turn, and not\ndaring to raise his eyes to her face, and the minutes seemed long to\nhim:  till at last she said in a voice scarcely yet clear of weeping:\n\n'Wilt thou say anything to me, and tell me what thou hast done, and\nwhy, and what thou deemest will come of it?'\n\nHe said:  'I will tell the truth as I know it, because thou askest it\nof me, and not because I would excuse myself before thee.  What have\nI done?  Yesterday I plighted my troth to wed the woman that I met\nlast autumn in the wood.  And why?  I wot not why, but that I longed\nfor her.  Yet I must tell thee that it seemed to me, and yet seemeth,\nthat I might do no otherwise--that there was nothing else in the\nworld for me to do.  What do I deem will come of it, sayest thou?\nThis, that we shall be happy together, she and I, till the day of our\ndeath.'\n\nShe said:  'And even so long shall I be sorry:  so far are we\nsundered now.  Alas! who looked for it?  And whither shall I turn to\nnow?'\n\nSaid Gold-mane:  'She bade me tell thee that to-morrow is a new day:\nmeseemeth I know her meaning.'\n\n'No word of hers hath any meaning to me,' said the Bride.\n\n'Nay,' said he, 'but hast thou not heard these rumours of war that\nare in the Dale?  Shall not these things avail thee?  Much may grow\nout of them; and thou with the mighty heart, so faithful and\ncompassionate!'\n\nShe said:  'What sayest thou?  What may grow out of them?  Yea, I\nhave heard those rumours as a man sick to death heareth men talk of\ntheir business down in the street while he lieth on his bed; and\nalready he hath done with it all, and hath no world to mend or mar.\nFor me nought shall grow out of it.  What meanest thou?'\n\nSaid Gold-mane:  'Is there nought in the fellowship of Folks, and the\naiding of the valiant, and the deliverance of the hapless?'\n\n'Nay,' she said, 'there is nought to me.  I cannot think of it to-day\nnor yet to-morrow belike.  Yet true it is that I may mingle in it,\nthough thinking nought of it.  But this shall not avail me.'\n\nShe was silent a little, but presently spake and said:  'Thou sayest\nright; it is not thou that hast done this, but the woman who sent me\nthe ring and the message of an old saw.  O that she should be born to\nsunder us!  How hath it befallen that I am now so little to thee and\nshe so much?'\n\nAnd again she was silent; and after a while Face-of-god spake kindly\nand softly and said:  'Kinswoman, wilt thou for ever begrudge our\nlove? this grudge lieth heavy on my soul, and it is I alone that have\nto bear it.'\n\nShe said:  'This is but a light burden for thee to bear, when thou\nhast nought else to bear!  But do I begrudge thee thy love, Gold-\nmane?  I know not that.  Rather meseemeth I do not believe in it--nor\nshall do ever.'\n\nThen she held her peace a long while, nor did he speak one word:  and\nthey were so still, that a robin came hopping about them, close to\nthe hem of her kirtle, and a starling pitched in the apple-tree hard\nby and whistled and chuckled, turning about and about, heeding them\nnought.  Then at last she lifted up her face from looking on the\ngrass and said:  'These are idle words and avail nothing:  one thing\nonly I know, that we are sundered.  And now it repenteth me that I\nhave shown thee my tears and my grief and my sickness of the earth\nand those that dwell thereon.  I am ashamed of it, as if thou hadst\nsmitten me, and I had come and shown thee the stripes, and said, See\nwhat thou hast done! hast thou no pity?  Yea, thou pitiest me, and\nwilt try to forget thy pity.  Belike thou art right when thou sayest,\nTo-morrow is a new day; belike matters will arise that will call me\nback to life, and I shall once more take heed of the joy and sorrow\nof my people.  Nay, it is most like that this I shall feign to do\neven now.  But if to-morrow be a new day, it is to-day now and not\nto-morrow, and so shall it be for long.  Hereof belike we shall talk\nno more, thou and I.  For as the days wear, the dealings between us\nshall be that thou shalt but get thee away from my life, and I shall\nbe nought to thee but the name of a kinswoman.  Thus should it be\neven wert thou to strive to make it otherwise; and thou shalt NOT\nstrive.  So let all this be; for this is not the word I had to say to\nthee.  But hearken! now are we sundered, and it irketh me beyond\nmeasure that folk know it not, and are kind, and rejoice in our love,\nand deem it a happy thing for the folk; and this burden I may bear no\nlonger.  So I shall declare unto men that I will not wed thee; and\nbelike they may wonder why it is, till they see thee wedded to the\nWoman of the Mountain.  Art thou content that so it shall be?'\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'Nay, thou shalt not take this all upon thyself; I\nalso shall declare unto the Folk that I will wed none but her, the\nMountain-Woman.'\n\nShe said:  'This shalt thou not do; I forbid it thee.  And I WILL\ntake it all upon myself.  Shall I have it said of me that I am unmeet\nto wed thee, and that thou hast found me out at last and at latest?\nI lay this upon thee, that wheresoever I declare this and whatsoever\nI may say, thou shalt hold thy peace.  This at least thou may'st do\nfor me.  Wilt thou?'\n\n'Yea,' he said, 'though it shall put me to shame.'\n\nAgain she was silent for a little; then she said:\n\n'O Gold-mane, this would I take upon myself not soothly for any shame\nof seeming to be thy cast-off; but because it is I who needs must\nbear all the sorrow of our sundering; and I have the will to bear it\ngreater and heavier, that I may be as the women of old time, and they\nthat have come from the Gods, lest I belittle my life with malice and\nspite and confusion, and it become poisonous to me.  Be at peace! be\nat peace!  And leave all to the wearing of the years; and forget not\nthat which thou hast sworn!'\n\nTherewith she turned and went from that green place toward the House\nof the Face, walking slowly through the garden amongst the sweet\nodours, beneath the fair blossoms, a body most dainty and beauteous\nof fashion, but the casket of grievous sorrow, which all that\ngoodliness availed not.\n\nBut Face-of-god lingered in that place a little, and for that little\nwhile the joy of his life was dulled and overworn; and the days\nbefore his wandering on the mountain seemed to him free and careless\nand happy days that he could not but regret.  He was ashamed,\nmoreover, that this so unquenchable grief should come but of him, and\nthe pleasure of his life, which he himself had found out for himself,\nand which was but such a little portion of the Earth and the deeds\nthereof.  But presently his thought wandered from all this, and as he\nturned away from the sundial and went his ways through the garden, he\ncalled to mind his longing for the day of the spring market, when he\nshould see the Sun-beam again and be cherished by the sweetness of\nher love.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.  OF THE GATE-THING AT BURGSTEAD\n\n\n\nBut now must he hasten, for the Gate-thing was to be holden two hours\nbefore noon; so he betook him speedily to the Hall, and took his\nshield and did on a goodly helm and girt his sword to his side, for\nmen must needs go to all folk-motes with their weapons and clad in\nwar-gear.  Thus he went forth to the Gate with many others, and there\nalready were many folk assembled in the space aforesaid betwixt the\nGate of the Burg and the sheer rocks on the face of which were the\nsteps that led up to the ancient Tower on the height.  The Alderman\nwas sitting on the great stone by the Gate-side which was his\nappointed place, and beside him on the stone bench were the six\nWardens of the Burg; but of the six Wardens of the Dale there were\nbut three, for the others had not yet heard tell of the battle or had\ngot the summons to the Thing, since they had been about their\nbusiness down the Dale.\n\nFace-of-god took his place silently amongst the neighbours, but men\nmade way for him, so that he must needs stand in front, facing his\nfather and the Wardens; and there went up a murmur of expectation\nround about him, both because the word had gone about that he had a\ntale of new tidings to tell, and also because men deemed him their\nbest and handiest man, though he was yet so young.\n\nNow the Alderman looked around and beheld a great throng gathered\ntogether, and he looked on the shadow of the Gate which the\nsouthering sun was casting on the hard white ground of the Thing-\nstead, and he saw that it had just taken in the standing-stone which\nwas in the midst of the place.  On the face of the said stone was\ncarven the image of a fighting man with shield on arm and axe in\nhand; for it had been set there in old time in memory of the man who\nhad bidden the Folk build the Gate and its wall, and had showed them\nhow to fashion it:  for he was a deft house-smith as well as a great\nwarrior; and his name was Iron-hand.  So when the Alderman saw that\nthis stone was wholly within the shadow of the Gate he knew that it\nwas the due time for the hallowing-in of the Thing.  So he bade one\nof the wardens who sat beside him and had a great slug-horn slung\nabout him, to rise and set the horn to his mouth.\n\nSo that man arose and blew three great blasts that went bellowing\nabout the towers and down the street, and beat back again from the\nface of the sheer rocks and up them and over into the wild-wood; and\nthe sound of it went on the light west-wind along the lips of the\nDale toward the mountain wastes.  And many a goodman, when he heard\nthe voice of the horn in the bright spring morning, left spade or axe\nor plough-stilts, or the foddering of the ewes and their younglings,\nand turned back home to fetch his sword and helm and hasten to the\nThing, though he knew not why it was summoned:  and women wending\nover the meadows, who had not yet heard of the battle in the wood,\nhearkened and stood still on the green grass or amidst the ripples of\nthe ford, and the threat of coming trouble smote heavy on their\nhearts, for they knew that great tidings must be towards if a Thing\nmust needs be summoned so close to the Great Folk-mote.\n\nBut now the Alderman stood up and spake amidst the silence that\nfollowed the last echoes of the horn:\n\n'Now is hallowed in this Gate-thing of the Burgstead Men and the Men\nof the Dale, wherein they shall take counsel concerning matters late\nbefallen, that press hard upon them.  Let no man break the peace of\nthe Holy Thing, lest he become a man accursed in holy places from the\nplain up to the mountain, and from the mountain down to the plain; a\nman not to be cherished of any man of good will, not be holpen with\nvictuals or edge-tool or draught-beast; a man to be sheltered under\nno roof-tree, and warmed at no hearth of man:  so help us the Warrior\nand the God of the Earth, and Him of the Face, and all the Fathers!'\n\nWhen he had spoken men clashed their weapons in token of assent; and\nhe sat down again, and there was silence for a space.  But presently\ncame thrusting forward a goodman of the Dale, who seemed as if he had\ncome hurriedly to the Thing; for his face was running down with\nsweat, his wide-rimmed iron cap sat awry over his brow, and he was\ngirt with a rusty sword without a scabbard, and the girdle was ill-\nbraced up about his loins.  So he said:\n\n'I am Red-coat of Waterless of the Lower Dale.  Early this morning as\nI was going afield I met on the way a man akin to me, Fox of Upton to\nwit, and he told me that men were being summoned to a Gate-thing.  So\nI turned back home, and caught up any weapon that came handy, and\nhere I am, Alderman, asking thee of the tidings which hath driven\nthee to call this Thing so hard on the Great Folk-mote, for I know\nthem nothing so.'\n\nThen stood up Iron-face the Alderman and said:  'This is well asked,\nand soon shall ye be as wise as I am on this matter.  Know ye, O men\nof Burgstead and the Dale, that we had not called this Gate-thing so\nhard on the Great Folk-mote had not great need been to look into\ntroublous matters.  Long have ye dwelt in peace, and it is years on\nyears now since any foeman hath fallen on the Dale:  but, as ye will\nbear in mind, last autumn were there ransackings in the Dale and\namidst of the Shepherds after the manner of deeds of war; and it\ntroubleth us that none can say who wrought these ill deeds.  Next,\nbut a little while agone, was Wood-grey, a valiant goodman of the\nWoodlanders, slain close to his own door by evil men.  These men we\ntook at first for mere gangrel felons and outcasts from their own\nfolk:  though there were some who spoke against that from the\nbeginning.\n\n'But thirdly are new tidings again:  for three days ago, while some\nof the folk were hunting peaceably in the Wild-wood and thinking no\nevil, they were fallen upon of set purpose by a host of men-at-arms,\nand nought would serve but mere battle for dear life, so that many of\nour neighbours were hurt, and three slain outright; and now mark\nthis, that those who there fell upon our folk were clad and armed\neven as the two felons that slew Wood-grey, and moreover were like\nthem in aspect of body.  Now stand forth Hall-face my son, and answer\nto my questions in a loud voice, so that all may hear thee.'\n\nSo Hall-face stood forth, clad in gleaming war-gear, with an axe over\nhis shoulder, and seemed a doughty warrior.  And Iron-face said to\nhim:\n\n'Tell me, son, those whom ye met in the wood, and of whom ye brought\nhome two captives, how much like were they to the murder-carles at\nWood-grey's?'\n\nSaid Hall-face:  'As like as peas out of the same cod, and to our\neyes all those whom we saw in the wood might have been sons of one\nfather and one mother, so much alike were they.'\n\n'Yea,' said the Alderman; 'now tell me how many by thy deeming fell\nupon you in the wood?'\n\nSaid Hall-face:  'We deemed that if they were any less than\nthreescore, they were little less.'\n\n'Great was the odds,' said the Alderman.  'Or how many were ye?'\n\n'One score and seven,' said Hall-face.\n\nSaid the Alderman:  'And yet ye escaped with life all save those\nthree?'\n\nHall-face said:  'I deem that scarce one should have come back alive,\nhad it not been that as we fought came a noise like the howling of\nwolves, and thereat the foemen turned and fled, and there followed on\nthe fleers tall men clad in sheep-brown raiment, who smote them down\nas they fled.'\n\n'Here then is the story, neighbours,' said the Alderman, 'and ye may\nsee thereby that if those slayers of Wood-grey were outcast, their\nband is a great one; but it seemeth rather that they were men of a\nfolk whose craft it is to rob with the armed hand, and to slay the\nrobbed; and that they are now gathering on our borders for war.  Yet,\nmoreover, they have foemen in the woods who should be fellows-in-arms\nof us.  How sayest thou, Stone-face?  Thou art old, and hast seen\nmany wars in the Dale, and knowest the Wild-wood to its innermost.\n\n'Alderman,' said Stone-face, 'and ye neighbours of the Dale, maybe\nthese foes whom ye have met are not of the race of man, but are\ntrolls and wood-wights.  Now if they be trolls it is ill, for then is\nthe world growing worser, and the wood shall be right perilous for\nthose who needs must fare therein.  Yet if they be men it is a worse\nmatter; for the trolls would not come out of the waste into the\nsunlight of the Dale.  But these foes, if they be men, are lusting\nafter our fair Dale to eat it up, and it is most like that they are\ngathering a huge host to fall upon us at home.  Such things I have\nheard of when I was young, and the aspect of the evil men who overran\nthe kindreds of old time, according to all tales and lays that I have\nheard, is even such as the aspect of those whom we have seen of late.\nAs to those wolves who saved the neighbours and chased their foemen,\nthere is one here who belike knoweth more of all this than we do, and\nthat, O Alderman, is thy son whom I have fostered, Face-of-god to\nwit.  Bid him answer to thy questioning, and tell us what he hath\nseen and heard of late; then shall we verily know the whole story as\nfar as it can be known.'\n\nThen men pressed round, and were eager to hear what Face-of-god would\nbe saying.  But or ever the Alderman could begin to question him, the\nthrong was cloven by new-comers, and these were the men who had been\nsent to bring home the corpses of the Dusky Men:  so they had cast\nloaded hooks into the Weltering Water, and had dragged up him whom\nFace-of-god had shoved into the eddy, and who had sunk like a stone\njust where he fell, and now they were bringing him on a bier along\nwith him who had been slain a-land.  They were set down in the place\nbefore the Alderman, and men who had not seen them before looked\neagerly on them that they might behold the aspect of their foemen;\nand nought lovely were they to look on; for the drowned man was\nalready bleached and swollen with the water, and the other, his face\nwas all wryed and twisted with that spear-thrust in the mouth.\n\nThen the Alderman said:  'I would question my son Face-of-god.  Let\nhim stand forth!'\n\nAnd therewith he smiled merrily in his son's face, for he was\nstanding right in front of him; and he said:\n\n'Ask of me, Alderman, and I will answer.'\n\n'Kinsman,' said Iron-face, 'look at these two dead men, and tell me,\nif thou hast seen any such besides those two murder-carles who were\nslain at Carlstead; or if thou knowest aught of their folk?'\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'Yesterday I saw six others like to these both in\narray and of body, and three of them I slew, for we were in battle\nwith them early in the morning.'\n\nThere was a murmur of joy at this word, since all men took these\nfelons for deadly foemen; but Iron-face said:  'What meanest thou by\n\"we\"?'\n\n'I and the men who had guested me overnight,' said Face-of-god, 'and\nthey slew the other three; or rather a woman of them slew the\nfelons.'\n\n'Valiant she was; all good go with her hand!' said the Alderman.\n'But what be these people, and where do they dwell?'\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'As to what they are, they are of the kindred of\nthe Gods and the Fathers, valiant men, and guest-cherishing:  rich\nhave they been, and now are poor:  and their poverty cometh of these\nsame felons, who mastered them by numbers not to be withstood.  As to\nwhere they dwell:  when I say the name of their dwelling-place men\nmock at me, as if I named some valley in the moon:  yet came I to\nBurgdale thence in one day across the mountain-necks led by sure\nguides, and I tell thee that the name of their abode is Shadowy\nVale.'\n\n'Yea,' said Iron-face, 'knoweth any man here of Shadowy Vale, or\nwhere it is?'\n\nNone answered for a while; but there was an old man who was sitting\non the shafts of a wain on the outskirts of the throng, and when he\nheard this word he asked his neighbour what the Alderman was saying,\nand he told him.  Then said that elder:\n\n'Give me place; for I have a word to say hereon.'  Therewith he\narose, and made his way to the front of the ring of men, and said:\n'Alderman, thou knowest me?'\n\n'Yea,' said Iron-face, 'thou art called the Fiddle, because of thy\nsweet speech and thy minstrelsy; whereof I mind me well in the time\nwhen I was young and thou no longer young.'\n\n'So it is,' said the Fiddle.  'Now hearken!  When I was very young I\nheard of a vale lying far away across the mountain-necks; a vale\nwhere the sun shone never in winter and scantily in summer; for my\nsworn foster-brother, Fight-fain, a bold man and a great hunter, had\nhappened upon it; and on a day in full midsummer he brought me\nthither; and even now I see the Vale before me as in a picture; a\nmarvellous place, well grassed, treeless, narrow, betwixt great\ncliff-walls of black stone, with a green river running through it\ntowards a yawning gap and a huge force.  Amidst that Vale was a doom-\nring of black stones, and nigh thereto a feast-hall well builded of\nthe like stones, over whose door was carven the image of a wolf with\nred gaping jaws, and within it (for we entered into it) were stone\nbenches on the dais.  Thence we came away, and thither again we went\nin late autumn, and so dusk and cold it was at that season, that we\nknew not what to call it save the valley of deep shade.  But its real\nname we never knew; for there was no man there to give us a name or\ntell us any tale thereof; but all was waste there; the wimbrel\nlaughed across its water, the raven croaked from its crags, the eagle\nscreamed over it, and the voices of its waters never ceased; and thus\nwe left it.  So the seasons passed, and we went thither no more:  for\nFight-fain died, and without him wandering over the waste was irksome\nto me; so never have I seen that valley again, or heard men tell\nthereof.\n\n'Now, neighbours, have I told you of a valley which seemeth to be\nShadowy Vale; and this is true and no made-up story.'\n\nThe Alderman nodded kindly to him, and then said to Face-of-god:\n'Kinsman, is this word according with what thou knowest of Shadowy\nVale?'\n\n'Yea, on all points,' said Face-of-god; 'he hath put before me a\npicture of the valley.  And whereas he saith, that in his youth it\nwas waste, this also goeth with my knowledge thereof.  For once was\nit peopled, and then was waste, and now again is it peopled.'\n\n'Tell us then more of the folk thereof,' said the Alderman; 'are they\nmany?'\n\n'Nay,' said Face-of-god, 'they are not.  How might they be many,\ndwelling in that narrow Vale amid the wastes?  But they are valiant,\nboth men and women, and strong and well-liking.  Once they dwelt in a\nfair dale called Silver-dale, the name whereof will be to you as a\nname in a lay; and there were they wealthy and happy.  Then fell upon\nthem this murderous Folk, whom they call the Dusky Men; and they\nfought and were overcome, and many of them were slain, and many\nenthralled, and the remnant of them escaped through the passes of the\nmountains and came back to dwell in Shadowy Vale, where their\nforefathers had dwelt long and long ago; and this overthrow befell\nthem ten years agone.  But now their old foemen have broken out from\nSilver-dale and have taken to scouring the wood seeking prey; so they\nfall upon these Dusky Men as occasion serves, and slay them without\npity, as if they were adders or evil dragons; and indeed they be\nworse.  And these valiant men know for certain that their foemen are\nnow of mind to fall upon this Dale and destroy it, as they have done\nwith others nigher to them.  And they will slay our men, and lie with\nour women against their will, and enthrall our children, and torment\nall those that lie under their hands till life shall be worse than\ndeath to them.  Therefore, O Alderman and Wardens, and ye neighbours\nall, it behoveth you to take counsel what we shall do, and that\nspeedily.'\n\nThere was again a murmur, as of men nothing daunted, but intent on\ntaking some way through the coming trouble.  But no man said aught\ntill the Alderman spake:\n\n'When didst thou first happen upon this Earl-folk, son?'\n\n'Late last autumn,' said Face-of-god.\n\nSaid Iron-face:  'Then mightest thou have told us of this tale\nbefore.'\n\n'Yea,' said his son, 'but I knew it not, or but little of it, till\ntwo days agone.  In the autumn I wandered in the woodland, and on the\nfell I happened on a few of this folk dwelling in a booth by the\npine-wood; and they were kind and guest-fain with me, and gave me\nmeat and drink and lodging, and bade me come to Shadowy Vale in the\nspring, when I should know more of them.  And that was I fain of; for\nthey are wise and goodly men.  But I deemed no more of those that I\nsaw there save as men who had been outlawed by their own folk for\ndeeds that were unlawful belike, but not shameful, and were biding\ntheir time of return, and were living as they might meanwhile.  But\nof the whole Folk and their foemen knew I no more than ye did, till\ntwo days agone, when I met them again in Shadowy Vale.  Also I think\nbefore long ye shall see their chieftain in Burgstead, for he hath a\nword for us.  Lastly, my mind it is that those brown-clad men who\nhelped Hall-face and his company in the wood were nought but men of\nthis Earl-kin seeking their foemen; for indeed they told me that they\nhad come upon a battle in the woodland wherein they had slain their\nfoemen.  Now have I told you all that ye need to know concerning\nthese matters.'\n\nAgain was there silence as Iron-face sat pondering a question for his\nson; then a goodman of the Upper Dale, Gritgarth to wit, spake and\nsaid:\n\n'Gold-mane mine, tell us how many is this folk; I mean their\nfighting-men?'\n\n'Well asked, neighbour,' said Iron-face.\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'Their fighting-men of full age may be five score;\nbut besides that there shall be some two or three score of women that\nwill fight, whoever says them nay; and many of these are little worse\nin the field than men; or no worse, for they shoot well in the bow.\nMoreover, there will be a full score of swains not yet twenty winters\nold whom ye may not hinder to fight if anything is a-doing.'\n\n'This is no great host,' said the Alderman; 'yet if they deem there\nis little to lose by fighting, and nought to gain by sitting still,\nthey may go far in winning their desire; and that more especially if\nthey may draw into their quarrel some other valiant Folk more in\nnumber than they be.  I marvel not, though, they were kind to thee,\nson Gold-mane, if they knew who thou wert.'\n\n'They knew it,' said Face-of-god.\n\n'Neighbours,' said the Alderman, 'have ye any rede hereon, and aught\nto say to back your rede?'\n\nThen spake the Fiddle:  'As ye know and may see, I am now very old,\nand, as the word goes, unmeet for battle:  yet might I get me to the\nfield, either on mine own legs or on the legs of some four-foot\nbeast, I would strike, if it were but one stroke, on these pests of\nthe earth.  And, Alderman, meseemeth we shall do amiss if we bid not\nthe Earl-folk of Shadowy Vale to be our fellows in arms in this\nadventure.  For look you, how few soever they be, they will be sure\nto know the ways of our foemen, and the mountain passes, and the\nsurest and nighest roads across the necks and the mires of the waste;\nand though they be not a host, yet shall they be worth a host to us?'\n\nWhen men heard his words they shouted for joy of them; for hatred of\nthe Dusky Men who should so mar their happy life in the Dale was\ngrowing up in them, and the more that hatred waxed, the more waxed\ntheir love of those valiant ones.\n\nNow Red-coat of Waterless spake again:  he was a big man, both tall\nand broad, ruddy-faced and red-haired, some forty winters old.  He\nsaid:\n\n'Life hath been well with us of the Lower Dale, and we deem that we\nhave much to lose in losing it.  Yet ill would the bargain be to buy\nlife with thralldom:  we have been over-merry hitherto for that.\nTherefore I say, to battle!  And as to these men, these well-wishers\nof Face-of-god, if they also are minded for battle with our foes, we\nwere fools indeed if we did not join them to our company, were they\nbut one score instead of six.'\n\nMen shouted again, and they said that Red-coat had spoken well.  Then\none after other the goodmen of the Dale came and gave their word for\nfellowship in arms with the Men of Shadowy Vale, if there were such\nas Face-of-god had said, which they doubted not; and amongst them\nthat spake were Fox of Nethertown, and Warwell, and Gritgarth, and\nBearswain, and Warcliff, and Hart of Highcliff, and Worm of\nWillowholm, and Bullsbane, and Highneb of the Marsh:  all these were\nstout men-at-arms and men of good counsel.\n\nLast of all the Alderman spake and said:\n\n'As to the war, that must we needs meet if all be sooth that we have\nheard, and I doubt it not.\n\n'Now therefore let us look to it like wise men while time yet serves.\nYe shall know that the muster of the Dalesmen will bring under shield\neight long hundreds of men well-armed, and of the Shepherd-Folk four\nhundreds, and of the Woodlanders two hundreds; and this is a goodly\nhost if it be well ordered and wisely led.  Now am I your Alderman\nand your Doomster, and I can heave up a sword as well as another\nmaybe, nor do I think that I shall blench in the battle; yet I\nmisdoubt me that I am no leader or orderer of men-of-war:  therefore\nye will do wisely to choose a wiser man-at-arms than I be for your\nWar-leader; and if at the Great Folk-mote, when all the Houses and\nKindreds are gathered, men yeasay your choosing, then let him abide;\nbut if they naysay it, let him give place to another.  For time\npresses.  Will ye so choose?'\n\n'Yea, yea!' cried all men.\n\n'Good is that, neighbours,' said the Alderman.  'Whom will ye have\nfor War-leader?  Consider well.'\n\nShort was their rede, for every man opened his mouth and cried out\n'Face-of-god!'  Then said the Alderman:\n\n'The man is young and untried; yet though he is so near akin to me, I\nwill say that ye will do wisely to take him; for he is both deft of\nhis hands and brisk; and moreover, of this matter he knoweth more\nthan all we together.  Now therefore I declare him your War-leader\ntill the time of the Great Folk-mote.'\n\nThen all men shouted with great glee and clashed their weapons; but\nsome few put their heads together and spake apart a little while, and\nthen one of them, Red-coat of Waterless to wit, came forward and\nsaid:  'Alderman, some of us deem it good that Stone-face, the old\nman wise in war and in the ways of the Wood, should be named as a\ncounsellor to the War-leader; and Hall-face, a very brisk and strong\nyoung man, to be his right hand and sword-bearer.'\n\n'Good is that,' said Iron-face.  'Neighbours, will ye have it so?'\nThis also they yeasaid without delay, and the Alderman declared\nStone-face and Hall-face the helpers of Face-of-god in this business.\nThen he said:\n\n'If any hath aught to say concerning what is best to be done at once,\nit were good that he said it now before all and not to murmur and\ngrudge hereafter.'\n\nNone spake save the Fiddle, who said:  'Alderman and War-leader, one\nthing would I say:  that if these foemen are anywise akin to those\noverrunners of the Folks of whom the tales went in my youth (for I\nalso as well as Stone-face mind me well of those tales concerning\nthem), it shall not avail us to sit still and await their onset.  For\nthen may they not be withstood, when they have gathered head and\nburst out and over the folk that have been happy, even as the waters\nthat overtop a dyke and cover with their muddy ruin the deep green\ngrass and the flower-buds of spring.  Therefore my rede is, as soon\nas may be to go seek these folk in the woodland and wheresoever else\nthey may be wandering.  What sayest thou, Face-of-god?'\n\n'My rede is as thine,' said he; 'and to begin with, I do now call\nupon ten tens of good men to meet me in arms at the beginning of\nWildlake's Way to-morrow morning at daybreak; and I bid my brother\nHall-face to summon such as are most meet thereto.  For this I deem\ngood, that we scour the wood daily at present till we hear fresh\ntidings from them of Shadowy Vale, who are nigher than we to the\nfoemen.  Now, neighbours, are ye ready to meet me?'\n\nThen all shouted, 'Yea, we will go, we will go!'\n\nSaid the Alderman:  'Now have we made provision for the war in that\nwhich is nearest to our hands.  Yet have we to deal with the matter\nof the fellowship with the Folk whom Face-of-god hath seen.  This is\na matter for thee, son, at least till the Great Folk-mote is holden.\nTell me then, shall we send a messenger to Shadowy Vale to speak with\nthis folk, or shall we abide the chieftain's coming?'\n\n'By my rede,' said Face-of-god, 'we shall abide his coming:  for\nfirst, though I might well make my way thither, I doubt if I could\ngive any the bearings, so that he could come there without me; and\nbelike I am needed at home, since I am become War-leader.  Moreover,\nwhen your messenger cometh to Shadowy Vale, he may well chance to\nfind neither the chieftain there, nor the best of his men; for whiles\nare they here, and whiles there, as they wend following after the\nDusky Men.'\n\n'It is well, son,' said the Alderman, 'let it be as thou sayest:\nsoothly this matter must needs be brought before the Great Folk-mote.\nNow will I ask if any other hath any word to say, or any rede to give\nbefore this Gate-thing sundereth?'\n\nBut no man came forward, and all men seemed well content and of good\nheart; and it was now well past noontide.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.  THE ENDING OF THE GATE-THING\n\n\n\nBut just as the Alderman was on the point of rising to declare the\nbreaking-up of the Thing, there came a stir in the throng and it\nopened, and a warrior came forth into the innermost of the ring of\nmen, arrayed in goodly glittering War-gear; clad in such wise that a\ntunicle of precious gold-wrought web covered the hauberk all but the\nsleeves thereof, and the hem of it beset with blue mountain-stones\nsmote against the ankles and well-nigh touched the feet, shod with\nsandals gold-embroidered and gemmed.  This warrior bore a goodly\ngilded helm on the head, and held in hand a spear with gold-garlanded\nshaft, and was girt with a sword whose hilts and scabbard both were\nadorned with gold and gems:  beardless, smooth-cheeked, exceeding\nfair of face was the warrior, but pale and somewhat haggard-eyed:\nand those who were nearby beheld and wondered; for they saw that\nthere was come the Bride arrayed for war and battle, as if she were a\nmessenger from the House of the Gods, and the Burg that endureth for\never.\n\nThen she fell to speech in a voice which at first was somewhat hoarse\nand broken, but cleared as she went on, and she said:\n\n'There sittest thou, O Alderman of Burgdale!  Is Face-of-god thy son\nanywhere nigh, so that he can hear me?'\n\nBut Iron-face wondered at her word, and said:  'He is beside thee, as\nhe should be.'  For indeed Face-of-god was touching her, shoulder to\nshoulder.  But she looked not to the right hand nor the left, but\nsaid:\n\n'Hearken, Iron-face!  Chief of the House of the Face, Alderman of the\nDale, and ye also, neighbours and goodmen of the Dale:  I am a woman\ncalled the Bride, of the House of the Steer, and ye have heard that I\nhave plighted my troth to Face-of-god to wed with him, to love him,\nand lie in his bed.  But it is not so:  we are not troth-plight; nor\nwill I wed with him, nor any other, but will wend with you to the\nwar, and play my part therein according to what might is in me; nor\nwill I be worser than the wives of Shadowy Vale.'\n\nFace-of-god heard her words with no change of countenance; but Iron-\nface reddened over all his face, and stared at her, and knit his\nbrows and said:\n\n'Maiden, what are these words?  What have we done to thee?  Have I\nnot been to thee as a father, and loved thee dearly?  Is not my son\ngoodly and manly and deft in arms?  Hath it not ever been the wont of\nthe House of the Face to wed in the House of the Steer? and in these\ntwo Houses there hath never yet been a goodlier man and a lovelier\nmaiden than are ye two.  What have we done then?'\n\n'Ye have done nought against me,' she said, 'and all that thou sayest\nis sooth; yet will I not wed with Face-of-god.'\n\nYet fiercer waxed the face of the Alderman, and he said in a loud\nvoice:\n\n'But how if I tell thee that I will speak with thy kindred of the\nSteer, and thou shalt do after my bidding whether thou wilt or\nwhether thou wilt not?'\n\n'And how will ye compel me thereto?' she said.  'Are there thralls in\nthe Dale?  Or will ye make me an outlaw?  Who shall heed it?  Or I\nshall betake me to Shadowy Vale and become one of their warrior-\nmaidens.'\n\nNow was the Alderman's face changing from red to white, and belike he\nforgat the Thing, and what he was doing there, and he cried out:\n\n'This is an evil day, and who shall help me?  Thou, Face-of-god, what\nhast thou to say?  Wilt thou let this woman go without a word?  What\nhath bewitched thee?'\n\nBut never a word spake his son, but stood looking straight forward,\ncold and calm by seeming.  Then turned Iron-face again to the Bride,\nand said in a softer voice:\n\n'Tell me, maiden, whom I erst called daughter, what hath befallen,\nthat thou wilt leave my son; thou who wert once so kind and loving to\nhim; whose hand was always seeking his, whose eyes were ever\nfollowing his; who wouldst go where he bade, and come when he called.\nWhat hath betid that ye have cast him out, and flee from our House?'\n\nShe flushed red beneath her helm and said:\n\n'There is war in the land, and I have seen it coming, and that things\nshall change around us.  I have looked about me and seen men happy\nand women content, and children weary for mere mirth and joy.  And I\nhave thought, in a day, or two days or three, all this shall be\nchanged, and the women shall be, some anxious and wearied with\nwaiting, some casting all hope away; and the men, some shall come\nback to the garth no more, and some shall come back maimed and\nuseless, and there shall be loss of friends and fellows, and mirth\ndeparted, and dull days and empty hours, and the children wandering\nabout marvelling at the sorrow of the house.  All this I saw before\nme, and grief and pain and wounding and death; and I said:  Shall I\nbe any better than the worst of the folk that loveth me?  Nay, this\nshall never be; and since I have learned to be deft with mine hands\nin all the play of war, and that I am as strong as many a man, and as\nhardy-hearted as any, I will give myself to the Warrior and the God\nof the Face; and the battle-field shall be my home, and the after-\ngrief of the fight my banquet and holiday, that I may bear the burden\nof my people, in the battle and out of it; and know every sorrow that\nthe Dale hath; and cast aside as a grievous and ugly thing the bed of\nthe warrior that the maiden desires, and the toying of lips and hands\nand soft words of desire, and all the joy that dwelleth in the Castle\nof Love and the Garden thereof; while the world outside is sick and\nsorry, and the fields lie waste and the harvest burneth.  Even so\nhave I sworn, even so will I do.'\n\nHer eyes glittered and her cheek was flushed, and her voice was clear\nand ringing now; and when she ended there arose a murmur of praise\nfrom the men round about her.  But Iron-face said coldly:\n\n'These are great words; but I know not what they mean.  If thou wilt\nto the field and fight among the carles (and that I would not naysay,\nfor it hath oft been done and praised aforetime), why shouldest thou\nnot go side by side with Face-of-god and as his plighted maiden?'\n\nThe light which the sweetness of speech had brought into her face had\ndied out of it now, and she looked weary and hapless as she answered\nhim slowly:\n\n'I will not wed with Face-of-god, but will fare afield as a virgin of\nwar, as I have sworn to the Warrior.'\n\nThen waxed Iron-face exceeding wroth, and he rose up before all men\nand cried loudly and fiercely:\n\n'There is some lie abroad, that windeth about us as the gossamers in\nthe lanes of an autumn morning.'\n\nAnd therewith he strode up to Face-of-god as though he had nought to\ndo with the Thing; and he stood before him and cried out at him while\nall men wondered:\n\n'Thou! what hast thou done to turn this maiden's heart to stone?  Who\nis it that is devising guile with thee to throw aside this worthy\nwedding in a worthy House, with whom our sons are ever wont to wed?\nSpeak, tell the tale!'\n\nBut Face-of-god held his peace and stood calm and proud before all\nmen.\n\nThen the blood mounted to Iron-face's head, and he forgat folk and\nkindred and the war to come, and he cried so that all the place rang\nwith the words of his anger:\n\n'Thou dastard!  I see thee now; it is thou that hast done this, and\nnot the maiden; and now thou hast made her bear a double burden, and\nset her on to speak for thee, whilst thou standest by saying nought,\nand wilt take no scruple's weight of her shame upon thee!'\n\nBut his son spake never a word, and Iron-face cried:  'Out on thee!\nI know thee now, and why thou wouldest not to the West-land last\nwinter.  I am no fool; I know thee.  Where hast thou hidden the\nstranger woman?'\n\nTherewith he drew forth his sword and hove it aloft as if to hew down\nFace-of-god, who spake not nor flinched nor raised a hand from his\nside.  But the Bride threw herself in front of Gold-mane, while there\narose an angry cry of 'The Peace of the Holy Thing!  Peace-breaking,\npeace-breaking!' and some cried, 'For the War-leader, the War-\nleader!' and as men could for the press they drew forth their swords,\nand there was tumult and noise all over the Thing-stead.\n\nBut Stone-face caught hold of the Alderman's right arm and dragged\ndown the sword, and the big carle, Red-coat of Waterless, came up\nbehind him and cast his arms about his middle and drew him back; and\npresently he looked around him, and slowly sheathed his sword, and\nwent back to his place and sat him down; and in a little while the\nnoise abated and swords were sheathed, and men waxed quiet again, and\nthe Alderman arose and said in a loud voice, but in the wonted way of\nthe head man of the Thing:\n\n'Here hath been trouble in the Holy Thing; a violent man hath\ntroubled it, and drawn sword on a neighbour; will the neighbours give\nthe dooming hereof into the hands of the Alderman?'\n\nNow all knew Iron-face, and they cried out, 'That will we.'  So he\nspake again:\n\n'I doom the troubler of the Peace of the Holy Thing to pay a fine, to\nwit double the blood-wite that would be duly paid for a full-grown\nfreeman of the kindreds.'\n\nThen the cry went up and men yeasaid his doom, and all said that it\nwas well and fairly doomed; and Iron-face sat still.\n\nBut Stone-face stood forth and said:\n\n'Here have been wild words in the air; and dreams have taken shape\nand come amongst us, and have bewitched us, so that friends and kin\nhave wrangled.  And meseemeth that this is through the wizardry of\nthese felons, who, even dead as they are, have cast spells over us.\nGood it were to cast them into the Death Tarn, and then to get to our\nwork; for there is much to do.'\n\nAll men yeasaid that; and Forkbeard of Lea went with those who had\nborne the corpses thither to cast them into the black pool.\n\nBut the Fiddle spake and said:\n\n'Stone-face sayeth sooth.  O Alderman, thou art no young man, yet am\nI old enough to be thy father; so will I give thee a rede, and say\nthis:  Face-of-god thy son is no liar or dastard or beguiler, but he\nis a young man and exceeding goodly of fashion, well-spoken and kind;\nso that few women may look on him and hear him without desiring his\nkindness and love, and to such men as this many things happen.\nMoreover, he hath now become our captain, and is a deft warrior with\nhis hands, and as I deem, a sober and careful leader of men;\ntherefore we need him and his courage and his skill of leading.  So\nrage not against him as if he had done an ill deed not to be\nforgiven--whatever he hath done, whereof we know not--for life is\nlong before him, and most like we shall still have to thank him for\nmany good deeds towards us.  As for the maiden, she is both lovely\nand wise.  She hath a sorrow at her heart, and we deem that we know\nwhat it is.  Yet hath she not lied when she said that she would bear\nthe burden of the griefs of the people.  Even so shall she do; and\nwhether she will, or whether she will not, that shall heal her own\ngriefs.  For to-morrow is a new day.  Therefore, if thou do after my\nrede, thou wilt not meddle betwixt these twain, but wilt remember all\nthat we have to do, and that war is coming upon us.  And when that is\nover, we shall turn round and behold each other, and see that we are\nnot wholly what we were before; and then shall that which were hard\nto forgive, be forgotten, and that which is remembered be easy to\nforgive.'\n\nSo he spake; and Iron-face sat still and put his left hand to his\nbeard as one who pondereth; but the Bride looked in the face of the\nold man the Fiddle, and then she turned and looked at Gold-mane, and\nher face softened, and she stood before the Alderman, and bent down\nbefore him and held out both her hands to him the palms upward.  Then\nshe said:  'Thou hast been wroth with me, and I marvel not; for thy\nhope, and the hope which we all had, hath deceived thee.  But kind\nindeed hast thou been to me ere now:  therefore I pray thee take it\nnot amiss if I call to thy mind the oath which thou swearedst on the\nHoly Boar last Yule, that thou wouldst not gainsay the prayer of any\nman if thou couldest perform it; therefore I bid thee naysay not\nmine:  and that is, that thou wilt ask me no more about this matter,\nbut wilt suffer me to fare afield like any swain of the Dale, and to\ndeal so with my folk that they shall not hinder me.  Also I pray thee\nthat thou wilt put no shame upon Face-of-god my playmate and my\nkinsman, nor show thine anger to him openly, even if for a little\nwhile thy love for him be abated.  No more than this will I ask of\nthee.'\n\nAll men who heard her were moved to the heart by her kindness and the\nsweetness of her voice, which was like to the robin singing suddenly\non a frosty morning of early winter.  But as for Gold-mane, his heart\nwas smitten sorely by it, and her sorrow and her friendliness grieved\nhim out of measure.\n\nBut Iron-face answered after a little while, speaking slowly and\nhoarsely, and with the shame yet clinging to him of a man who has\nbeen wroth and has speedily let his wrath run off him.  So he said:\n\n'It is well, my daughter.  I have no will to forswear myself; nor\nhast thou asked me a thing which is over-hard.  Yet indeed I would\nthat to-day were yesterday, or that many days were worn away.'\n\nThen he stood up and cried in a loud voice over the throng:\n\n'Let none forget the muster; but hold him ready against the time that\nthe Warden shall come to him.  Let all men obey the War-leader, Face-\nof-god, without question or delay.  As to the fine of the peace-\nbreaker, it shall be laid on the altar of the God at the Great Folk-\nmote.  Herewith is the Thing broken up.'\n\nThen all men shouted and clashed their weapons, and so sundered, and\nwent about their business.\n\nAnd the talk of men it was that the breaking of the troth-plight\nbetween those twain was ill; for they loved Face-of-god, and as for\nthe Bride they deemed her the Dearest of the kindreds and the Jewel\nof the Folk, and as if she were the fairest and the kindest of all\nthe Gods.  Neither did the wrath of Iron-face mislike any; but they\nsaid he had done well and manly both to be wroth and to let his wrath\nrun off him.  As to the war which was to come, they kept a good heart\nabout it, and deemed it as a game to be played, wherein they might\nshow themselves deft and valiant, and so get back to their merry life\nagain.\n\nSo wore the day through afternoon to even and night.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.  FACE-OF-GOD LEADETH A BAND THROUGH THE WOOD\n\n\n\nNext morning tryst was held faithfully, and an hundred and a half\nwere gathered together on Wildlake's Way; and Face-of-god ordered\nthem into three companies.  He made Hall-face leader over the first\none, and bade him hold on his way northward, and then to make for\nBoars-bait and see if he should meet with anything thereabout where\nthe battle had been.  Red-coat of Waterless he made captain of the\nsecond band; and he had it in charge to wend eastward along the edge\nof the Dale, and not to go deep into the wood, but to go as far as he\nmight within the time appointed, toward the Mountains.  Furthermore,\nhe bade both Hall-face and Red-coat to bring their bands back to\nWildlake's Way by the morrow at sunset, where other goodmen should be\ncome to take the places of their men; and then if he and his company\nwere back again, he would bid them further what to do; but if not, as\nseemed likely, then Hall-face's band to go west toward the Shepherd\ncountry half a day's journey, and so back, and Red-coat's east along\nthe Dale's lip again for the like time, and then back, so that there\nmight be a constant watch and ward of the Dale kept against the\nFelons.\n\nAll being ordered Gold-mane led his own company north-east through\nthe thick wood, thinking that he might so fare as to come nigh to\nSilver-dale, or at least to hear tidings thereof.  This intent he\ntold to Stone-face, but the old man shook his head and said:\n\n'Good is this if it may be done; but it is not for everyone to go\ndown to Hell in his lifetime and come back safe with a tale thereof.\nHowever, whither thou wilt lead, thither will I follow, though\nassured death waylayeth us.'\n\nAnd the old carle was joyous and proud to be on this adventure, and\nsaid, that it was good indeed that his foster-son had with him a man\nwell stricken in years, who had both seen many things, and learned\nmany, and had good rede to give to valiant men.\n\nSo they went on their ways, and fared very warily when they were\ngotten beyond those parts of the wood which they knew well.  By this\ntime they were strung out in a long line; and they noted their road\ncarefully, blazing the trees on either side when there were trees,\nand piling up little stone-heaps where the trees failed them.  For\nStone-face said that oft it befell men amidst the thicket and the\nwaste to be misled by wights that begrudged men their lives, so that\nthey went round and round in a ring which they might not depart from\ntill they died; and no man doubted his word herein.\n\nAll day they went, and met no foe, nay, no man at all; nought but the\nwild things of the wood; and that day the wood changed little about\nthem from mile to mile.  There were many thickets across their road\nwhich they had to go round about; so that to the crow flying over the\ntree-tops the journey had not been long to the place where night came\nupon them, and where they had to make the wood their bedchamber.\n\nThat night they lighted no fire, but ate such cold victual as they\nmight carry with them; nor had they shot any venison, since they had\nwith them more than enough; they made little noise or stir therefore\nand fell asleep when they had set the watch.\n\nOn the morrow they arose betimes, and broke their fast and went their\nways till noon:  by then the wood had thinned somewhat, and there was\nlittle underwood betwixt the scrubby oak and ash which were pretty\nnigh all the trees about:  the ground also was broken, and here and\nthere rocky, and they went into and out of rough little dales, most\nof which had in them a brook of water running west and southwest; and\nnow Face-of-god led his men somewhat more easterly; and still for\nsome while they met no man.\n\nAt last, about four hours after noon, when they were going less\nwarily, because they had hitherto come across nothing to hinder them,\nrising over the brow of a somewhat steep ridge, they saw down in the\nvalley below them a half score of men sitting by the brook-side\neating and drinking, their weapons lying beside them, and along with\nthem stood a woman with her hands tied behind her back.\n\nThey saw at once that these men were of the Felons, so they that had\ntheir bows bent, loosed at them without more ado, while the others\nran in upon them with sword and spear.  The felons leapt up and ran\nscattering down the dale, such of them as were not smitten by the\nshafts; but he who was nighest to the woman, ere he ran, turned and\ncaught up a sword from the ground and thrust it through her, and the\nnext moment fell across the brook with an arrow in his back.\n\nNo one of the felons was nimble enough to escape from the fleet-foot\nhunters of Burgdale, and they were all slain there to the number of\neleven.\n\nBut when they came back to the woman to tend her, she breathed her\nlast in their hands:  she was a young and fair woman, black-haired\nand dark-eyed.  She had on her body a gown of rich web, but nought\nelse:  she had been bruised and sore mishandled, and the Burgdale\ncarles wept for pity of her, and for wrath, as they straightened her\nlimbs on the turf of the little valley.  They let her lie there a\nlittle, whilst they searched round about, lest there should be any\nother poor soul needing their help, or any felon lurking thereby; but\nthey found nought else save a bundle wherein was another rich gown\nand divers woman's gear, and sundry rings and jewels, and therewithal\nthe weapons and war-gear of a knight, delicately wrought after the\nWestland fashion:  these seemed to them to betoken other foul deeds\nof these murder-carles.  So when they had abided a while, they laid\nthe dead woman in mould by the brook-side, and buried with her the\nother woman's attire and the knight's gear, all but his sword and\nshield, which they had away with them:  then they cast the carcasses\nof the felons into the brake, but brought away their weapons and the\nsilver rings from their arms, which they wore like all the others of\nthem whom they had fallen in with; and so went on their way to the\nnorth-east, full of wrath against those dastards of the Earth.\n\nIt was hard on sunset when they left the valley of murder, and they\nwent no long way thence before they must needs make stay for the\nnight; and when they had arrayed their sleeping-stead the moon was\nup, and they saw that before them lay the close wood again, for they\nhad made their lair on the top of a little ridge.\n\nThere then they lay, and nought stirred them in the night, and\nbetimes on the morrow they were afoot, and entered the abovesaid\nthicket, wherein two of them, keen hunters, had been aforetime, but\nhad not gone deep into it.  Through this wood they went all day\ntoward the north-east, and met nought but the wild things therein.\nAt last, when it was near sunset, they came out of the thicket into a\nsmall plain, or shallow dale rather, with no great trees in it, but\nthorn-brakes here and there where the ground sank into hollows; a\nlittle river ran through the midst of it, and winded round about a\nheight whose face toward the river went down sheer into the water,\nbut away from it sank down in a long slope to where the thick wood\nbegan again:  and this height or burg looked well-nigh west.\n\nThitherward they went; but as they were drawing nigh to the river,\nand were on the top of a bent above a bushy hollow between them and\nthe water, they espied a man standing in the river near the bank, who\nsaw them not, because he was stooping down intent on something in the\nbank or under it:  so they gat them speedily down into the hollow\nwithout noise, that they might get some tidings of the man.\n\nThen Face-of-god bade his men abide hidden under the bushes and stole\nforward quietly up the further bank of the hollow, his target on his\narm and his spear poised.  When he was behind the last bush on the\ntop of the bent he was within half a spear-cast of the water and the\nman; so he looked on him and saw that he was quite naked except for a\nclout about his middle.\n\nFace-of-god saw at once that he was not one of the Dusky Men; he was\na black-haired man, but white-skinned, and of fair stature, though\nnot so tall as the Burgdale folk.  He was busied in tickling trouts,\nand just as Face-of-god came out from the bush into the westering\nsunlight, he threw up a fish on to the bank, and looked up\ntherewithal, and beheld the weaponed man glittering, and uttered a\ncry, but fled not when he saw the spear poised for casting.\n\nThen Face-of-god spake to him and said:  'Come hither, Woodsman! we\nwill not harm thee, but we desire speech of thee:  and it will not\navail thee to flee, since I have bowmen of the best in the hollow\nyonder.'\n\nThe man put forth his hands towards him as if praying him to forbear\ncasting, and looked at him hard, and then came dripping from out the\nwater, and seemed not greatly afeard; for he stooped down and picked\nup the trouts he had taken, and came towards Face-of-god stringing\nthe last-caught one through the gills on to the withy whereon were\nthe others:  and Face-of-god saw that he was a goodly man of some\nthirty winters.\n\nThen Face-of-god looked on him with friendly eyes and said:\n\n'Art thou a foemen? or wilt thou be helpful to us?'\n\nHe answered in the speech of the kindreds with the hoarse voice of a\nmuch weather-beaten man:\n\n'Thou seest, lord, that I am naked and unarmed.'\n\n'Yet may'st thou bewray us,' said Face-of-god.  'What man art thou?'\n\nSaid the man:  'I am the runaway thrall of evil men; I have fled from\nRose-dale and the Dusky Men.  Hast thou the heart to hurt me?'\n\n'We are the foemen of the Dusky Men,' said Face-of-God; 'wilt thou\nhelp us against them?'\n\nThe man knit his brows and said:  'Yea, if ye will give me your word\nnot to suffer me to fall into their hands alive.  But whence art\nthou, to be so bold?'\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'We are of Burgdale; and I will swear to thee on\nthe edge of the sword that thou shalt not fall alive into the hands\nof the Dusky Men.'\n\n'Of Burgdale have I heard,' said the man; 'and in sooth thou seemest\nnot such a man as would bewray a hapless man.  But now had I best\nbring you to some lurking-place where ye shall not be easily found of\nthese devils, who now oft-times scour the woods hereabout.'\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'Come first and see my fellows; and then if thou\nthinkest we have need to hide, it is well.'\n\nSo the man went side by side with him towards their lair, and as they\nwent Gold-mane noted marks of stripes on his back and sides, and\nsaid:  'Sorely hast thou been mishandled, poor man!'\n\nThen the man turned on him and said somewhat fiercely:  'Said I not\nthat I had been a thrall of the Dusky Men? how then should I have\nescaped tormenting and scourging, if I had been with them for but\nthree days?'\n\nAs he spake they came about a thorn-bush, and there were the Burgdale\nmen down in the hollow; and the man said:  'Are these thy fellows?\nCall to mind that thou hast sworn by the edge of the sword not to\nhurt me.'\n\n'Poor man!' said Face-of-god; 'these are thy friends, unless thou\nbewrayest us.'\n\nThen he cried aloud to his folk:  'Here is now a good hap! this is a\nrunaway thrall of the Dusky Men; of him shall we hear tidings; so\ncherish him all ye may.'\n\nSo the carles thronged about him and bestirred themselves to help\nhim, and one gave him his surcoat for a kirtle, and another cast a\ncloak about him; and they brought him meat and drink, such as they\nhad ready to hand:  and the man looked as if he scarce believed in\nall this, but deemed himself to be in a dream.  But presently he\nturned to Face-of-god and said:\n\n'Now I see so many men and weapons I deem that ye have no need to\nskulk in caves to-night, though I know of good ones:  yet shall ye do\nwell not to light a fire till moon-setting; for the flame ye may\nlightly hide, but the smoke may be seen from far aloof.'\n\nBut they bade him to meat, and he needed no second bidding but ate\nlustily, and they gave him wine, and he drank a great draught and\nsighed as for joy.  Then he said in a trembling voice, as though he\nfeared a naysay:\n\n'If ye are from Burgdale ye shall be faring back again presently; and\nI pray you to take me with you.'\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'Yea surely, friend, that will we do, and rejoice\nin thee.'\n\nThen he drank another cup which Warcliff held out to him, and spake\nagain:  'Yet if ye would abide here till about noon to-morrow, or\nmayhappen a little later, I would bring other runaways to see you;\nand them also might ye take with you:  ye may think when ye see them\nthat ye shall have small gain of their company; for poor wretched\nfolk they be, like to myself.  Yet since ye seek for tidings, herein\nmight they do you more service than I; for amongst them are some who\ncame out of the hapless Dale within this moon; and it is six months\nsince I escaped.  Moreover, though they may look spent and outworn\nnow, yet if ye give them a little rest, and feed them well, they\nshall yet do many a day's work for you:  and I tell you that if ye\ntake them for thralls, and put collars on their necks, and use them\nno worse than a goodman useth his oxen and his asses, beating them\nnot save when they are idle or at fault, it shall be to them as if\nthey were come to heaven out of hell, and to such goodhap as they\nhave not thought of, save in dreams, for many and many a day.  And\nthus I entreat you to do because ye seem to me to be happy and\nmerciful men, who will not begrudge us this happiness.'\n\nThe carles of Burgdale listened eagerly to what he said, and they\nlooked at him with great eyes and marvelled; and their hearts were\nmoved with pity towards him; and Stone-face said:\n\n'Herein, O War-leader, need I give thee no rede, for thou mayst see\nclearly that all we deem that we should lose our manhood and become\nthe dastards of the Warrior if we did not abide the coming of these\npoor men, and take them back to the Dale, and cherish them.'\n\n'Yea,' said Wolf of Whitegarth, 'and great thanks we owe to this man\nthat he biddeth us this:  for great will be the gain to us if we\nbecome so like the Gods that we may deliver the poor from misery.\nNow must I needs think how they shall wonder when they come to\nBurgdale and find out how happy it is to dwell there.'\n\n'Surely,' said Face-of-god, 'thus shall we do, whatever cometh of it.\nBut, friend of the wood, as to thralls, there be none such in the\nDale, but therein are all men friends and neighbours, and even so\nshall ye be.'\n\nAnd he fell a-musing, when he bethought him of how little he had\nknown of sorrow.\n\nBut that man, when he beheld the happy faces of the Burgdalers, and\nhearkened to their friendly voices, and understood what they said,\nand he also was become strong with the meat and drink, he bowed his\nhead adown and wept a long while; and they meddled not with him, till\nhe turned again to them and said:\n\n'Since ye are in arms, and seem to be seeking your foemen, I suppose\nye wot that these tyrants and man-quellers will fall upon you in\nBurgdale ere the summer is well worn.'\n\n'So much we deem indeed,' said Face-of-god, 'but we were fain to hear\nthe certainty of it, and how thou knowest thereof.'\n\nSaid the man:  'It was six moons ago that I fled, as I have told you;\nand even then it was the common talk amongst our masters that there\nwere fair dales to the south which they would overrun.  Man would say\nto man:  We were over many in Silver-dale, and we needed more\nthralls, because those we had were lessening, and especially the\nwomen; now are we more at ease in Rose-dale, though we have sent\nthralls to Silver-dale; but yet we can bear no more men from thence\nto eat up our stock from us:  let them fare south to the happy dales,\nand conquer them, and we will go with them and help therein, whether\nwe come back to Rose-dale or no.  Such talk did I hear then with mine\nown ears:  but some of those whom I shall bring to you to-morrow\nshall know better what is doing, since they have fled from Rose-dale\nbut a few days.  Moreover, there is a man and a woman who have fled\nfrom Silver-dale itself, and are but a month from it, journeying all\nthe time save when they must needs hide; and these say that their\nmasters have got to know the way to Burgdale, and are minded for it\nbefore the winter, as I said; and nought else but the ways thither do\nthey desire to know, since they have no fear.'\n\nBy then was night come, and though the moon was high in heaven, and\nlighted all that waste, the Burgdalers must needs light a fire for\ncooking their meat, whatsoever that woodsman might say; moreover, the\nnight was cold and somewhat frosty.  A little before they had come to\nthat place they had shot a fat buck and some smaller deer, but of\nother meat they had no great store, though there was wine enough.  So\nthey lit their fire in the thickest of the thorn-bush to hide it all\nthey might, and thereat they cooked their venison and the trouts\nwhich the runaway had taken, and they fell to, and ate and drank and\nwere merry, making much of that poor man till him-seemed he was\ngotten into the company of the kindest of the Gods.\n\nBut when they were full, Face-of-god spake to him, and asked him his\nname; and he named himself Dallach; but said he:  'Lord, this is\naccording to the naming of men in Rose-dale before we were\nenthralled:  but now what names have thralls?  Also I am not\naltogether of the blood of them of Rose-dale, but of better and more\nwarrior-like kin.'\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'Thou hast named Silver-dale; knowest thou it?'\n\nDallach answered:  'I have never seen it.  It is far hence; in a\nweek's journey, making all diligence, and not being forced to hide\nand skulk like those runaways, ye shall come to the mouth thereof\nlying west, where its rock-walls fall off toward the plain.'\n\n'But,' said Face-of-god, 'is there no other way into that Dale?'\n\n'Nay, none that folk wot of,' said Dallach, 'except to bold cragsmen\nwith their lives in their hands.'\n\n'Knowest thou aught of the affairs of Silver-dale?' said Face-of-god.\n\nSaid Dallach:  'Somewhat I know:  we wot that but a few years ago\nthere was a valiant folk dwelling therein, who were lords of the\nwhole dale, and that they were vanquished by the Dusky Men:  but\nwhether they were all slain and enthralled we wot not; but we deem it\notherwise.  As for me it is of their blood that I am partly come; for\nmy father's father came thence to settle in Rose-dale, and wedded a\nwoman of the Dale, who was my father's mother.'\n\n'When was it that ye fell under the Dusky Men?' said Face-of-god.\n\nSaid Dallach:  'It was five years ago.  They came into the Dale a\ngreat company, all in arms.'\n\n'Was there battle betwixt you?' said Face-of-god.\n\n'Alas! not so,' said Dallach.  'We were a happy folk there; but soft\nand delicate:  for the Dale is exceeding fertile, and beareth wealth\nin abundance, both corn and oil and wine and fruit, and of beasts for\nman's service the best that may be.  Would that there had been\nbattle, and that I had died therein with those that had a heart to\nfight; and even so saith now every man, yea, every woman in the Dale.\nBut it was not so when the elders met in our Council-House on the day\nwhen the Dusky Men bade us pay them tribute and give them houses to\ndwell in and lands to live by.  Then had we weapons in our hands, but\nno hearts to use them.'\n\n'What befell then?' said the goodman of Whitegarth.\n\nSaid Dallach:  'Look ye to it, lords, that it befall not in Burgdale!\nWe gave them all they asked for, and deemed we had much left.  What\nbefell, sayst thou?  We sat quiet; we went about our work in fear and\ntrembling, for grim and hideous were they to look on.  At first they\nmeddled not much with us, save to take from our houses what they\nwould of meat and drink, or raiment, or plenishing.  And all this we\ndeemed we might bear, and that we needed no more than to toil a\nlittle more each day so as to win somewhat more of wealth.  But soon\nwe found that it would not be so; for they had no mind to till the\nteeming earth or work in the acres we had given them, or to sit at\nthe loom, or hammer in the stithy, or do any manlike work; it was we\nthat must do all that for their behoof, and it was altogether for\nthem that we laboured, and nought for ourselves; and our bodies were\nonly so much our own as they were needful to be kept alive for\nlabour.  Herein were our tasks harder than the toil of any mules or\nasses, save for the younger and goodlier of the women, whom they\nwould keep fair and delicate to be their bed-thralls.\n\n'Yet not even so were our bodies safe from their malice:  for these\nmen were not only tyrants, but fools and madmen.  Let alone that\nthere were few days without stripes and torments to satiate their\nfury or their pleasure, so that in all streets and nigh any house\nmight you hear wailing and screaming and groaning; but moreover,\nthough a wise man would not willingly slay his own thrall any more\nthan his own horse or ox, yet did these men so wax in folly and\nmalice, that they would often hew at man or woman as they met them in\nthe way from mere grimness of soul; and if they slew them it was\nwell.  Thereof indeed came quarrels enough betwixt master and master,\nfor they are much given to man-slaying amongst themselves:  but what\nprofit to us thereof?  Nay, if the dead man were a chieftain, then\nwoe betide the thralls! for thereof must many an one be slain on his\ngrave-mound to serve him on the hell-road.  To be short:  we have\nheard of men who be fierce, and men who be grim; but these we may\nscarce believe us to be men at all, but trolls rather; and ill will\nit be if their race waxeth in the world.'\n\nThe Burgdale men hearkened with all their ears, and wondered that\nsuch things could befall; and they rejoiced at the work that lay\nbefore them, and their hearts rose high at the thought of battle in\nthat behalf, and the fame that should come of it.  As for the\nrunaway, they made so much of him that the man marvelled; for they\ndealt with him like a woman cherishing a son, and knew not how to be\nkind enough to him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.  THE MEN OF BURGDALE MEET THE RUNAWAYS\n\n\n\nNow ere the night was far spent, Dallach arose and said:\n\n'Kind folk, ye will presently be sleeping; but I bid you keep a good\nwatch, and if ye will be ruled by me, ye will kindle no fire on the\nmorrow, for the smoke riseth thick in the morning air, and is as a\nbeacon.  As for me, I shall leave you here to rest, and I myself will\nfare on mine errand.'\n\nThey bade him sleep and rest him after so many toils and hardships,\nsaying that they were not tied to an hour to be back in Burgdale; but\nhe said:  'Nay, the moon is high, and it is as good as daylight to\nme, who could find my way even by starlight; and your tarrying here\nis nowise safe.  Moreover, if I could find those folk and bring them\npart of the way by night and cloud it were well; for if we were taken\nagain, burning quick would be the best death by which we should die.\nAs for me, now am I strong with meat and drink and hope; and when I\ncome to Burgdale there will be time enough for resting and slumber.'\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'Shall I not wend with thee to see these people\nand the lairs wherein they hide?'\n\nThe man smiled:  'Nay, earl,' said he, 'that shall not be.  For wot\nye what?  If they were to see me in company of a man-at-arms they\nwould deem that I was bringing the foe upon them, and would flee, or\nmayhappen would fall upon us.  For as for me, when I saw thee, thou\nwert close anigh me, so I knew thee to be no Dusky Man; but they\nwould see the glitter of thine arms from afar, and to them all\nweaponed men are foemen.  Thou, lord, knowest not the heart of a\nthrall, nor the fear and doubt that is in it.  Nay, I myself must\ncast off these clothes that ye have given me, and fare naked, lest\nthey mistrust me.  Only I will take a spear in my hand, and sling a\nknife round my neck, if ye will give them to me; for if the worst\nhappen, I will not be taken alive.'\n\nTherewith he cast off his raiment, and they gave him the weapons and\nwished him good speed, and he went his way twixt moonlight and\nshadow; but the Burgdalers went to sleep when they had set a watch.\n\nEarly in the morning they awoke, and the sun was shining and the\nthrushes singing in the thorn-brake, and all seemed fair and\npeaceful, and a little haze still hung about the face of the burg\nover the river.  So they went down to the water and washed the night\nfrom off them; and thence the most part of them went back to their\nlair among the thorn-bushes:  but four of them went up the dale into\nthe oak-wood to shoot a buck, and five more they sent out to watch\ntheir skirts around them; and Face-of-god with old Stone-face went\nover a ford of the stream, and came on to the lower slope of the\nburg, and so went up it to the top.  Thence they looked about to see\nif aught were stirring, but they saw little save the waste and the\nwood, which on the north-east was thick of big trees stretching out a\nlong way.  Their own lair was clear to see over its bank and the\nbushes thereof, and that misliked Face-of-god, lest any foe should\nclimb the burg that day.  The morning was clear, and Face-of-god\nlooking north-and-by-west deemed he saw smoke rising into the air\nover the tree-covered ridges that hid the further distance toward\nthat airt, though further east uphove the black shoulders of the\nGreat that Waste and the snowy peaks behind them.  The said smoke was\nnot such as cometh from one great fire, but was like a thin veil\nstaining the pale blue sky, as when men are burning ling on the\nheath-side and it is seen aloof.\n\nHe showed that smoke to Stone-face, who smiled and said:\n\n'Now will they be lighting the cooking fires in Rose-dale:  would I\nwere there with a few hundreds of axes and staves at my back!'\n\n'Yea,' said Face-of-god, smiling in his face, 'but where I pray thee\nare these elves and wood-wights, that we meet them not?  Grim things\nthere are in the woods, and things fair enough also:  but meseemeth\nthat the trolls and the elves of thy young years have been frighted\naway.'\n\nSaid Stone-face:  'Maybe, foster-son; that hath been seen ere now,\nthat when one race of man overrunneth the land inhabited by another,\nthe wights and elves that love the vanquished are seen no more, or\nget them away far off into the outermost wilds, where few men ever\ncome.'\n\n'Yea,' said Face-of-god, 'that may well be.  But deemest thou by that\ntoken that we shall be vanquished?'\n\n'As for us, I know not,' said Stone-face; 'but thy friends of Shadowy\nVale have been vanquished.  Moreover, concerning these felons whom\nnow we are hunting, are we all so sure that they be men?  Certain it\nis, that when I go into battle with them, I shall smite with no more\npity than my sword, as if I were smiting things that may not feel the\nwoes of man.'\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'Yea, even so shall it be with me.  But what\nthinkest thou of these runaways?  Shall we have tidings of them, or\nshall Dallach bring the foe upon us?  It was for the sake of that\nquestion that I have clomb the burg:  and that we might watch the\nland about us.'\n\n'Nay,' said Stone-face, 'I have seen many men, and I deem of Dallach\nthat he is a true man.  I deem we shall soon have tidings of his\nfellows; and they may have seen the elves and wood-wights:  I would\nfain ask them thereof, and am eager to see them.'\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'And I somewhat dread to see them, and their rags\nand their misery and the weals of their stripes.  It irked me to see\nDallach when he first fell to his meat last night, how he ate like a\ndog for fear and famine.  How shall it be, moreover, when we have\nthem in the Dale, and they fall to the deed of kind there, as they\nneeds must.  Will they not bear us evil and thrall-like men?'\n\n'Maybe,' said Stone-face, 'and maybe not; for they have been thralls\nbut for a little while:  and I deem that in no long time shall ye see\nthem much bettered by plenteous meat and rest.  And after all is\nsaid, this Dallach bore him like a valiant man; also it was valiant\nof him to flee; and of the others may ye say the like.  But look you!\nthere are men going down yonder towards our lair:  belike those shall\nbe our guests, and there be no Dusky Men amongst them.  Come, let us\nhome!'\n\nSo Face-of-god looked and beheld from the height of the burg shapes\nof men grey and colourless creeping toward the lair from sunshine to\nshadow, like wild creatures shy and fearful of the hunter, or so he\ndeemed of them.\n\nSo he turned away, angry and sad of heart, and the twain went down\nthe burg and across the water to their camp, having seen little to\ntell of from the height.\n\nWhen they came to their campment there were their folk standing in a\nring round about Dallach and the other runaways.  They made way for\nthe War-leader and Stone-face, who came amongst them and beheld the\nRunaways, that they were many more than they looked to see; for they\nwere of carles one score and three, and of women eighteen, all told\nsave Dallach.  When they saw those twain come through the ring of men\nand perceived that they were chieftains, some of them fell down on\ntheir knees before them and held out their joined hands to them, and\nkissed the Burgdalers' feet and the hems of their garments, while the\ntears streamed out of their eyes:  some stood moving little and\nstaring before them stupidly:  and some kept glancing from face to\nface of the well-liking happy Burgdale carles, though for a while\neven their faces were sad and downcast at the sight of the poor men:\nsome also kept murmuring one or two words in their country tongue,\nand Dallach told Face-of-god that these were crying out for victual.\n\nIt must be said of these poor folk that they were of divers\nconditions, and chiefly of three:  and first there were seven of\nRose-dale and five of Silver-dale late come to the wood (of these\nSilver-dalers Dallach had told but of two, for the other three were\nbut just come).  Of these twelve were seven women, and all, save two\nof the women, were clad in one scanty kirtle or shirt only; for such\nwas the wont of the Dusky Men with their thralls.  They had brought\naway weapons, and had amongst them six axes and a spear, and a sword,\nand five knives, and one man had a shield.\n\nYet though these were clad and armed, yet in some wise were they the\nworst of all; they were so timorous and cringing, and most of them\nheavy-eyed and sullen and down-looking.  Many of them had been\ngrievously mishandled:  one man had had his left hand smitten off;\nanother was docked of three of his toes, and the gristle of his nose\nslit up; one was halt, and four had been ear-cropped, nor did any\nlack weals of whipping.  Of the Silver-dale new-comers the three men\nwere the worst of all the Runaways, with wild wandering eyes, but\nsullen also, and cringing if any drew nigh, and would not look anyone\nin the face, save presently Face-of-god, on whom they were soon fond\nto fawn, as a dog on his master.  But the women who were with them,\nand who were well-nigh as timorous as the men, were those two gaily-\ndad ones, and they were soft-handed and white-skinned, save for the\nlast days of weather in the wood; for they had been bed-thralls of\nthe Dusky Men.\n\nSuch were the new-comers to the wood.  But others had been, like\nDallach, months therein; it may be said that there were eighteen of\nthese, carles and queens together.  Little raiment they had amongst\nthem, and some were all but stark naked, so that on these might well\nbe seen as on Dallach the marks of old stripes, and of these also\nwere there men who had been shorn of some member or other, and they\nwere all burnt and blackened by the weather of the woodland; yet for\nall their nakedness, they bore themselves bolder and more manlike\nthan the later comers, nor did they altogether lack weapons taken\nfrom their foemen, and most of them had some edge-tool or another.\nOf these folk were four from Silver-dale, though Dallach knew it not.\n\nBesides these were a half score and one who had been years in the\nwood instead of months; weather-beaten indeed were these, shaggy and\nrough-skinned like wild men of kind.  Some of them had made\nthemselves skin breeches or clouts, some went stark naked; of weapons\nof the Dale had they few, but they bore bows of hazel or wych-elm\nstrung with deer-gut, and shafts headed with flint stones; staves\nalso of the same fashion, and great clubs of oak or holly:  some of\nthem also had made them targets of skin and willow-twigs, for these\nwere the warriors of the Runaways:  they had a few steel knives\namongst them, but had mostly learned the craft of using sharp flints\nfor knives:  but four of these were women.\n\nThree of these men were of the kindreds of the Wolf from Silver-dale,\nand had been in the wood for hard upon ten years, and wild as they\nwere, and without hope of meeting their fellows again, they went\nproudly and boldly amongst the others, overtopping them by the head\nand more.  For the greater part of these men were somewhat short of\nstature, though by nature strong and stout of body.\n\nIt must be told that though Dallach had thus gotten all these many\nRunaways together, yet had they not been dwelling together as one\nfolk; for they durst not, lest the Dusky Men should hear thereof and\nfall upon them, but they had kept themselves as best they could in\ncaves and in brakes three together or two, or even faring alone as\nDallach did:  only as he was a strong and stout-hearted man, he went\nto and fro and wandered about more than the others, so that he\nforegathered with most of them and knew them.  He said also that he\ndoubted not but that there were more Runaways in the wood, but these\nwere all he could come at.  Divers who had fled had died from time to\ntime, and some had been caught and cruelly slain by their masters.\nThey were none of them old; the oldest, said Dallach, scant of forty\nwinters, though many from their aspect might have been old enough.\n\nSo Face-of-god looked and beheld all these poor people; and said to\nhimself, that he might well have dreaded that sight.  For here was he\nbrought face to face with the Sorrow of the Earth, whereof he had\nknown nought heretofore, save it might be as a tale in a minstrel's\nsong.  And when he thought of the minutes that had made the hours,\nand the hours that had made the days that these men had passed\nthrough, his heart failed him, and he was dumb and might not speak,\nthough he perceived that the men of Burgdale looked for speech from\nhim; but he waved his hand to his folk, and they understood him, for\nthey had heard Dallach say that some of them were crying for victual.\nSo they set to work and dighted for them such meat as they had, and\nthey set them down on the grass and made themselves their carvers and\nserving-men, and bade them eat what they would of such as there was.\nYet, indeed, it grieved the Burgdalers again to note how these folk\nwere driven to eat; for they themselves, though they were merry folk,\nwere exceeding courteous at table, and of great observance of\nmanners:  whereas these poor Runaways ate, some of them like hungry\ndogs, and some hiding their meat as if they feared it should be taken\nfrom them, and some cowering over it like falcons, and scarce any\nwith a manlike pleasure in their meal.  And, their eating over, the\nmore part of them sat dull and mopish, and as if all things were\nforgotten for the time present.\n\nAlbeit presently Dallach bestirred him and said to Face-of-god:\n'Lord of the Earl-folk, if I might give thee rede, it were best to\nturn your faces to Burgdale without more tarrying.  For we are over-\nnigh to Rose-dale, being but thus many in company.  But when we come\nto our next resting-place, then shall bring thee to speech with the\nlast-comers from Silver-dale; for there they talk with the tongue of\nthe kindreds; but we of Rose-dale for the more part talk otherwise;\nthough in my house it came down from father to son.'\n\n'Yea,' said Face-of-god, gazing still on that unhappy folk, as they\nsat or lay upon the grass at rest for a little while:  but him-seemed\nas he gazed that some memories of past time stirred in some of them;\nfor some, they hung their heads and the tears stole out of their eyes\nand rolled down their cheeks.  But those older Runaways of Silver-\ndale were not crouched down like most of the others, but strode up\nand down like beasts in a den; yet were the tears on the face of one\nof these.  Then Face-of-god constrained himself, and spake to the\nfolk, and said:  'We are now over-nigh to our foes of Rose-dale to\nlie here any longer, being too few to fall upon them.  We will come\nhither again with a host when we have duly questioned these men who\nhave sought refuge with us:  and let us call yonder height the Burg\nof the Runaways, and it shall be a landmark for us when we are on the\nroad to Rose-dale.'\n\nThen the Burgdalers bade the Runaways courteously and kindly to arise\nand take the road with them; and by that time were their men all come\nin; and four of them had venison with them, which was needful, if\nthey were to eat that night or the morrow, as the guests had eaten\nthem to the bone.\n\nSo they tarried no more, but set out on the homeward way; and Face-\nof-god bade Dallach walk beside him, and asked him such concerning\nRose-dale and its Dusky Men.  Dallach told him that these were not so\nmany as they were masterful, not being above eight hundreds of men,\nall fighting-men.  As to women, they had none of their own race, but\nlay with the Daleswomen at their will, and begat children of them;\nand all or most of the said children favoured the race of their\nbegetters.  Of the men-children they reared most, but the women-\nchildren they slew at once; for they valued not women of their own\nblood:  but besides the women of the Dale, they would go at whiles in\nbands to the edges of the Plain and beguile wayfarers, and bring back\nwith them thence women to be their bed-thralls; albeit some of these\nwere bought with a price from the Westland men.\n\nAs to the number of the folk of Rose-dale, its own folk, he said they\nwould number some five thousand souls, one with another; of whom some\nthousand might be fit to bear arms if they had the heart thereto, as\nthey had none.  Yet being closely questioned, he deemed that they\nmight fall on their masters from behind, if battle were joined.\n\nHe said that the folk of Rose-dale had been a goodly folk before they\nwere enthralled, and peaceable with one another, but that now it was\na sport of the Dusky Men to set a match between their thralls to\nfight it out with sword and buckler or otherwise; and the vanquished\nman, if he were not sore hurt, they would scourge, or shear some\nmember from him, or even slay him outright, if the match between the\nowners were so made.  And many other sad and grievous tales he told\nto Face-of-god, more than need be told again; so that the War-leader\nwent along sorry and angry, with his teeth set, and his hand on the\nsword-hilt.\n\nThus they went till night fell on them, and they could scarce see the\nsigns they had made on their outward journey.  Then they made stay in\na little valley, having set a watch duly; and since they were by this\ntime far from Rose-dale, and were a great company as regarded\nscattered bands of the foe, they lighted their fires and cooked their\nvenison, and made good cheer to the Runaways, and so went to sleep in\nthe wild-wood.\n\nWhen morning was come they gat them at once to the road; and if the\nBurgdalers were eager to be out of the wood, their eagerness was as\nnought to the eagerness of the Runaways, most of whom could not be\neasy now, and deemed every minute lost unless they were wending on to\nthe Dale; so that this day they were willing to get over the more\nground, whereas they had not set out on their road till afternoon\nyesterday.\n\nHowsoever, they rested at noontide, and Face-of-god bade Dallach\nbring him to speech with others of the Runaways, and first that he\nmight talk with those three men of the kindreds who had fled from\nSilver-dale in early days.  So Dallach brought them to him; but he\nfound that though they spake the tongue, they were so few-spoken from\nwildness and loneliness, at least at first, that nought could come\nfrom them that was not dragged from them.\n\nThese men said that they had been in the wood more than nine years,\nso that they knew but little of the conditions of the Dale in that\npresent day.  However, as to what Dallach had said concerning the\nDusky Men, they strengthened his words; and they said that the Dusky\nMen took no delight save in beholding torments and misery, and that\nthey doubted if they were men or trolls.  They said that since they\nhad dwelt in the wood they had slain not a few of the foemen,\nwaylaying them as occasion served, but that in this warfare they had\nlost two of their fellows.  When Face-of-god asked them of their\ndeeming of the numbers of the Dusky Men, they said that before those\nbands had broken into Rose-dale, they counted them, as far as they\ncould call to mind, at about three thousand men, all warriors; and\nthat somewhat less than one thousand had gone up into Rose-dale, and\nsome had died, and many had been cast away in the wild-wood, their\nfellows knew not how.  Yet had not their numbers in Silver-dale\ndiminished; because two years after they (the speakers) had fled,\ncame three more Dusky Companies or Tribes into Silver-dale, and each\nof these tribes was of three long hundreds; and with their coming had\nthe cruelty and misery much increased in the Dale, so that the\nthralls began to die fast; and that drave the Dusky Men beyond the\nborders of Silver-dale, so that they fell upon Rose-dale.  When asked\nhow many of the kindreds might yet be abiding in Silver-dale, their\nfaces clouded, and they seemed exceeding wroth, and answered, that\nthey would willingly hope that most of those that had not been slain\nat the time of the overthrow were now dead, yet indeed they feared\nthere were yet some alive, and mayhappen not a few women.\n\nBy then must they get on foot again, and so the talk fell between\nthem; but when they made stay for the night, after they had done\ntheir meat, Face-of-god prayed Dallach bring to him some of the\nlatest-come folk from Silver-dale, and he brought to him the man and\nthe woman who had been in the Dale within that moon.  As to the man,\nif those of the Earl-folk had been few-spoken from fierceness and\nwildness, he was no less so from mere dulness and weariness of\nmisery; but the woman's tongue went glibly enough, and it seemed to\npleasure her to talk about her past miseries.  As aforesaid, she was\nbetter clad than most of those of Rose-dale, and indeed might be\ncalled gaily clad, and where her raiment was befouled or rent, it was\nfrom the roughness of the wood and its weather, and not from the\nthralldom.  She was a young and fair woman, black-haired and grey-\neyed.  She had washed herself that day in a woodland stream which\nthey had crossed on the road, and had arrayed her garments as trimly\nas she might, and had plucked some fumitory, wherewith she had made a\ngarland for her head.  She sat down on the grass in front of Face-of-\ngod, while the man her mate stood leaning against a tree and looked\non her greedily.  The Burgdale carles drew near to her to hearken her\nstory, and looked kindly on the twain.  She smiled on them, but\nespecially on Face-of-god, and said:\n\n'Thou hast sent for me, lord, and I wot well thou wouldst hear my\ntale shortly, for it would be long to tell if I were to tell it\nfully, and bring into it all that I have endured, which has been\nbitter enough, for all that ye see me smooth of skin and well-liking\nof body.  I have been the bed-thrall of one of the chieftains of the\nDusky Men, at whose house many of their great men would assemble, so\nthat ye may ask me whatso ye will; as I have heard much talk and may\ncall it to mind.  Now if ye ask me whether I have fled because of the\nshame that I, a free woman come of free folk, should be a mere thrall\nin the bed of the foes of my kin, and with no price paid for me, I\nmust needs say it is not so; since over long have we of the Dale been\nthralls to be ashamed of such a matter.  And again, if ye deem that I\nhave fled because I have been burdened with grievous toil and been\ndriven thereto by the whip, ye may look on my hands and my body and\nye will see that I have toiled little therewith:  nor again did I\nflee because I could not endure a few stripes now and again; for such\nusage do thralls look for, even when they are delicately kept for the\nsake of the fairness of their bodies, and this they may well endure;\nyea also, and the mere fear of death by torment now and again.  But\nbefore me lay death both assured and horrible; so I took mine own\ncounsel, and told none for fear of bewrayal, save him who guarded me;\nand that was this man; who fled not from fear, but from love of me,\nand to him I have given all that I might give.  So we got out of the\nhouse and down the Dale by night and cloud, and hid for one whole day\nin the Dale itself, where I trembled and feared, so that I deemed I\nshould die of fear; but this man was well pleased with my company,\nand with the lack of toil and beating even for the day.  And in the\nnight again we fled and reached the wild-wood before dawn, and well-\nnigh fell into the hands of those who were hunting us, and had\noutgone us the day before, as we lay hid.  Well, what is to say?\nThey saw us not, else had we not been here, but scattered piece-meal\nover the land.  This carle knew the passes of the wood, because he\nhad followed his master therein, who was a great hunter in the\nwastes, contrary to the wont of these men, and he had lain a night on\nthe burg yonder; therefore he brought me thither, because he knew\nthat thereabout was plenty of prey easy to take, and he had a bow\nwith him; and there we fell in with others of our folk who had fled\nbefore, and with Dallach; who e'en now told us what was hard to\nbelieve, that there was a fair young man like one of the Gods leading\na band of goodly warriors, and seeking for us to bring us into a\npeaceful and happy land; and this man would not have gone with him\nbecause he feared that he might fall into thralldom of other folk,\nwho would take me away from him; but for me, I said I would go in any\ncase, for I was weary of the wood and its roughness and toil, and\nthat if I had a new master he would scarcely be worse than my old one\nwas at his best, and him I could endure.  So I went, and glad and\nglad I am, whatever ye will do with me.  And now will I answer whatso\nye may ask of me.'\n\nShe laid her limbs together daintily and looked fondly on Face-of-\ngod, and the carle scowled at her somewhat at first, but presently,\nas he watched her, his face smoothed itself out of its wrinkles.\n\nBut Face-of-god pondered a little while, and then asked the woman if\nshe had heard any words to remember of late days concerning the\naffairs of the Dusky Men and their intent; and he said:\n\n'I pray thee, sister, be truthful in thine answer, for somewhat lieth\non it.'\n\nShe said:  'How could I speak aught but the sooth to thee, O lovely\nlord?  The last word spoken hereof I mind me well:  for my master had\nbeen mishandling me, and I was sullen to him after the smart, and he\nmocked and jeered me, and said:  Ye women deem we cannot do without\nyou, but ye are fools, and know nothing; we are going to conquer a\nnew land where the women are plenty, and far fairer than ye be; and\nwe shall leave you to fare afield like the other thralls, or work in\nthe digging of silver; and belike ye wot what that meaneth.  Also he\nsaid that they would leave us to the new tribe of their folk, far\nwilder than they, whom they looked for in the Dale in about a moon's\nwearing; so that they needs must seek to other lands.  Also this same\ntalk would we hear whenever it pleased any of them to mock us their\nbed-thralls.  Now, my sweet lord, this is nought but the very sooth.'\n\nAgain spake Face-of-god after a while:\n\n'Tell me, sister, hast thou heard of any of the Dusky Men being slain\nin the wood?'\n\n'Yea,' she said, and turned pale therewith and caught her breath as\none choking; but said in a little while:\n\n'This alone was it hard for me to tell thee amongst all the I griefs\nI have borne, whereof I might have told thee many tales, and will do\none day if thou wilt suffer it; but fear makes this hard for me.  For\nin very sooth this was the cause of my fleeing, that my master was\nbrought in slain by an arrow in the wood; and he was to be borne to\nbale and burned in three days' wearing; and we three bed-thralls of\nhis, and three of the best of the men-thralls, were to be burned\nquick on his bale-fire after sore torments; therefore I fled, and hid\na knife in my bosom, that I might not be taken alive; but sweet was\nlife to me, and belike I should not have smitten myself.'\n\nAnd she wept sore for pity of herself before them all.  But Face-of-\ngod said:\n\n'Knowest thou, sister, by whom the man was slain?'\n\n'Nay,' she said, still sobbing; 'but I heard nought thereof, nor had\nI noted it in my terror.  The death of others, who were slain before\nhim, and the loss of many, we knew not how, made them more bitterly\ncruel with us.'\n\nAnd again was she weeping; but Face-of-god said kindly to her:  'Weep\nno more, sister, for now shall all thy troubles be over; I feel in my\nheart that we shall overcome these felons, and make an end of them,\nand there then is Burgdale for thee in its length and breadth, or\nthine own Dale to dwell in freely.'\n\n'Nay,' she said, 'never will I go back thither!' and she turned round\nto him and kissed his feet, and then arose and turned a little toward\nher mate; and the carle caught her by the hand and led her away, and\nseemed glad so to do.\n\nSo once again they fell asleep in the woods, and again the next\nmorning fared on their way early that they might come into Burgdale\nbefore nightfall.  When they stayed a while at noontide and ate,\nFace-of-god again had talk with the Runaways, and this time with\nthose of Rose-dale, and he heard much the same story from them that\nhe had heard before, told in divers ways, till his heart was sick\nwith the hearing of it.\n\nOn this last day Face-of-god led his men well athwart the wood, so\nthat he hit Wildlake's Way without coming to Carl-stead; and he came\ndown into the Dale some four hours after noon on a bright day of\nlatter March.  At the ingate to the Dale he found watches set, the\nmen whereof told him that the tidings were not right great.  Hall-\nface's company had fallen in with a band of the Felons three score in\nnumber in the oak-wood nigh to Boars-bait, and had slain some and\nchased the rest, since they found it hard to follow them home as they\nran for the tangled thicket:  of the Burgdalers had two been slain\nand five hurt in this battle.\n\nAs for Red-coat's company, they had fallen in with no foemen.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.  THEY BRING THE RUNAWAYS TO BURGSTEAD\n\n\n\nSo now being out of the wood, they went peaceably and safely along\nthe Portway, the Runaways mingling with the Dalesmen.  Strange showed\namidst the health and wealth of the Dale the rags and misery and\nnakedness of the thralls, like a dream amidst the trim gaiety of\nspring; and whomsoever they met, or came up with on the road, whatso\nhis business might be, could not refrain himself from following them,\nbut mingled with the men-at-arms, and asked them of the tidings; and\nwhen they heard who these poor people were, even delivered thralls of\nthe Foemen, they were glad at heart and cried out for joy; and many\nof the women, nay, of the men also, when they first came across that\nmisery from out the heart of their own pleasant life, wept for pity\nand love of the poor folk, now at last set free, and blessed the\nswords that should do the like by the whole people.\n\nThey went slowly as men began to gather about them; yea, some of the\ngood folk that lived hard by must needs fare home to their houses to\nfetch cakes and wine for the guests; and they made them sit down and\nrest on the green grass by the side of the Portway, and eat and drink\nto cheer their hearts; others, women and young swains, while they\nrested went down into the meadows and plucked of the spring flowers,\nand twined them hastily with deft and well-wont fingers into chaplets\nand garlands for their heads and bodies.  Thus indeed they covered\ntheir nakedness, till the lowering faces and weather-beaten skins of\nthose hardly-entreated thralls looked grimly out from amidst the\nknots of cowslip and oxlip, and the branches of the milk-white\nblackthorn bloom, and the long trumpets of the daffodils, of the hue\nthat wrappeth round the quill which the webster takes in hand when\nshe would pleasure her soul with the sight of the yellow growing upon\nthe dark green web.\n\nSo they went on again as the evening was waning, and when they were\ngotten within a furlong of the Gate, lo! there was come the\nminstrelsy, the pipe and the tabor, the fiddle and the harp, and the\nfolk that had learned to sing the sweetest, both men and women, and\nRedesman at the head of them all.\n\nThen fell the throng into an ordered company; first went the music,\nand then a score of Face-of-god's warriors with drawn swords and\nuplifted spears; and then the flower-bedecked misery of the Runaways,\nmen and women going together, gaunt, befouled, and hollow-eyed, with\nhere and there a flushed cheek or gleaming eye, or tear-bedewed face,\nas the joy and triumph of the eve pierced through their wonted\nweariness of grief; then the rest of the warriors, and lastly the\nmingled crowd of Dalesfolk, tall men and fair women gaily arrayed,\nclean-faced, clear-skinned, and sleek-haired, with glancing eyes and\nruddy lips.\n\nAnd now Redesman turned about to the music and drew his bow across\nhis fiddle, and the other bows ran out in concert, and the harps\nfollowed the story of them, and he lifted up his voice and sang the\nwords of an old song, and all the singers joined him and blended\ntheir voices with his.  And these are some of the words which they\nsang:\n\n\nLo! here is Spring, and all we are living,\n   We that were wan with Winter's fear;\nReach out your hands to her hands that are giving,\n   Lest ye lose her love and the light of the year.\n\nMany a morn did we wake to sorrow,\n   When low on the land the cloud-wrath lay;\nMany an eve we feared to-morrow,\n   The unbegun unfinished day.\n\nAh we--we hoped not, and thou wert tardy;\n   Nought wert thou helping; nought we prayed.\nWhere was the eager heart, the hardy?\n   Where was the sweet-voiced unafraid?\n\nBut now thou lovest, now thou leadest,\n   Where is gone the grief of our minds?\nWhat was the word of the tale, that thou heedest\n   E'en as the breath of the bygone winds?\n\nGreen and green is thy garment growing\n   Over thy blossoming limbs beneath;\nUp o'er our feet rise the blades of thy sowing,\n   Pierced are our hearts with thine odorous breath.\n\nBut where art thou wending, thou new-comer?\n   Hurrying on to the Courts of the Sun?\nWhere art thou now in the House of the Summer?\n   Told are thy days and thy deed is done.\n\nSpring has been here for us that are living\n   After the days of Winter's fear;\nHere in our hands is the wealth of her giving,\n   The Love of the Earth, and the Light of the Year.\n\n\nThus came they to the Gate, and lo! the Bride thereby, leaning\nagainst a buttress, gazing with no dull eyes at the coming throng.\nShe was now clad in her woman's attire again, to wit a light flame-\ncoloured gown over a green kirtle; but she yet bore a gilded helm on\nher head and a sword girt to her side in token of her oath to the\nGod.  She had been in Hall-face's company in that last battle, and\nhad done a man's service there, fighting very valiantly, but had not\nbeen hurt, and had come back to Burgstead when the shift of men was.\n\nNow she drew herself up and stood a little way before the Gate and\nlooked forth on the throng, and when her eyes beheld the Runaways\namidst of the weaponed carles of Burgdale, her face flushed, and her\neyes filled with tears as she stood, partly wondering, partly deeming\nwhat they were.  She waited till Stone-face came by her, and then she\ntook the old man by the sleeve, and drew him apart a little and said\nto him:  'What meaneth this show, my friend?  Who hath clad these\nfolk thus strangely; and who be these three naked tall ones, so\nfierce-looking, but somewhat noble of aspect?'\n\nFor indeed those three men of the kindreds, when they had gotten into\nthe Dale, and had rested them, and drunk a cup of wine, and when they\nhad seen the chaplets and wreaths of the spring-flowers wherewith\nthey were bedecked, and had smelt the sweet savour of them, fell to\nwalking proudly, heeding not their nakedness; for no rag had they\nupon them save breech-clouts of deer-skin:  they had changed weapons\nwith the Burgdale carles; and one had gotten a great axe, which he\nbore over his shoulder, and the shaft thereof was all done about with\ncopper; and another had shouldered a long heavy thrusting-spear, and\nthe third, an exceeding tall man, bore a long broad-bladed war-sword.\nThus they went, brown of skin beneath their flower-garlands, their\nlong hair bleached by the sun falling about their shoulders; high\nthey strode amongst the shuffling carles and tripping women of the\nlater-come thralls.  But when they heard the music, and saw that they\nwere coming to the Gate in triumph, strange thoughts of old memories\nswelled up in their hearts, and they refrained them not from weeping,\nfor they felt that the joy of life had come back to them.\n\nNor must it be deemed that these were the only ones amongst the\nRunaways whose hearts were cheered and softened:  already were many\nof them coming back to life, as they felt their worn bodies caressed\nby the clear soft air of Burgdale, and the sweetness of the flowers\nthat hung about them, and saw all round about the kind and happy\nfaces of their well-willers.\n\nSo Stone-face looked on the Bride as she stood with face yet tear-\nbedewed, awaiting his answer, and said:\n\n'Daughter, thou sayest who clad these folk thus?  It was misery that\nhath so dight them; and they are the images of what we shall be if we\nlove foul life better than fair death, and so fall into the hands of\nthe Felons, who were the masters of these men.  As for the tall naked\nmen, they are of our own blood, and kinsmen to Face-of-god's new\nfriends; and they are of the best of the vanquished:  it was in early\ndays that they fled from thralldom; as we may have to do.  Now,\ndaughter, I bid thee be as joyous as thou art valiant, and then shall\nall be well.'\n\nTherewith she smiled on him, and he departed, and she stood a little\nwhile, as the throng moved on and was swallowed by the Gate, and\nlooked after them; and for all her pity for the other folk, she\nthought chiefly of those fearless tall men who were of the blood of\nthose with whom it was lawful to wed.\n\nThere she stood as the wind dried the tears upon her cheeks, thinking\nof the sorrow which these folk had endured, and their stripes and\nmocking, their squalor and famine; and she wondered and looked on her\nown fair and shapely hands with the precious finger-rings thereon,\nand on the dainty cloth and trim broidery of her sleeve; and she\ntouched her smooth cheek with the back of her hand, and smiled, and\nfelt the spring sweet in her mouth, and its savour goodly in her\nnostrils; and therewith she called to mind the aspect of her lovely\nbody, as whiles she had seen it imaged, all its full measure, in the\nclear pool at midsummer, or piece-meal, in the shining steel of the\nWestland mirror.  She thought also with what joy she drew the breath\nof life, yea, even amidst of grief, and of how sweet and pure and\nwell-nurtured she was, and how well beloved of many friends and the\nwhole folk, and she set all this beside those woeful bodies and\nlowering faces, and felt shame of her sorrow of heart, and the pain\nit had brought to her; and ever amidst shame and pity of all that\nmisery rose up before her the images of those tall fierce men, and it\nseemed to her as if she had seen something like to them in some dream\nor imagination of her mind.\n\nSo came the Burgdalers and their guests into the street of Burgstead\namidst music and singing; and the throng was great there.  Then Face-\nof-god bade make a ring about the strangers, and they did so, and he\nand the Runaways alone were in the midst of it; and he spake in a\nloud voice and said:\n\n'Men of the Dale and the Burg, these folk whom here ye see in such a\nsorry plight are they whom our deadly foes have rejoiced to torment;\nlet us therefore rejoice to cherish them.  Now let those men come\nforth who deem that they have enough and more, so that they may each\ntake into their houses some two or three of these friends such as\nwould be fain to be together.  And since I am War-leader, and have\nthe right hereto, I will first choose them whom I will lead into the\nHouse of the Face.  And lo you! will I have this man (and he laid his\nhand on Dallach),who is he whom I first came across, and who found us\nall these others, and next I will have yonder tall carles, the three\nof them, because I perceive them to be men meet to be with a War-\nleader, and to follow him in battle.'\n\nTherewith he drew the three Men of the Wolf towards him, but Dallach\nalready was standing beside him.  And folk rejoiced in Face-of-god.\n\nBut the Bride came forward next, and spake to him meekly and simply:\n\n'War-leader, let me have of the women those who need me most, that I\nmay bring them to the House of the Steer, and try if there be not\nsome good days yet to be found for them, wherein they shall but\nremember the past grief as an ugly dream.'\n\nThen Face-of-god looked on her, and him-seemed he had never seen her\nso fair; and all the shame wherewith he had beheld her of late was\ngone from him, and his heart ran over with friendly love towards her\nas she looked into his face with kindly eyes; and he said:\n\n'Kinswoman, take thy choice as thy kindness biddeth, and happy shall\nthey be whom thou choosest.'\n\nShe bowed her head soberly, and chose from among the guests four\nwomen of the saddest and most grievous, and no man of their kindred\nspake for going along with them; then she went her ways home, leading\none of them by the hand, and strange was it to see those twain going\nthrough sun and shade together, that poor wretch along with the\ngoodliest of women.\n\nThen came forward one after other of the worthy goodmen of the Dale,\nand especially such as were old, and they led away one one man, and\nanother two, and another three, and often would a man crave to go\nwith a woman or a woman with a man, and it was not gainsaid them.  So\nwere all the guests apportioned, and ill-content were those goodmen\nthat had to depart without a guest; and one man would say to another:\n'Such-an-one, be not downcast; this guest shall be between us, if he\nwill, and shall dwell with thee and me month about; but this first\nmonth with me, since I was first comer.'  And so forth was it said.\n\nNow to prevent the time to come, it may be said about the Runaways,\nthat when they had been a little while amongst the Burgdalers, well\nfed and well clad and kindly cherished, it was marvellous how they\nwere bettered in aspect of body, and it began to be seen of them that\nthey were well-favoured people, and divers of the women exceeding\ngoodly, black-haired and grey-eyed, and very clear-skinned and white-\nskinned; most of them were young, and the oldest had not seen above\nforty winters.  They of Rose-dale, and especially such as had first\nfled away to the wood, were very soon seen to be merry and kindly\nfolk; but they who had been longest in captivity, and notably those\nfrom Silver-dale who were not of the kindreds, were for a long time\nsullen and heavy, and it availed little to trust to them for the\ndoing of work; albeit they would follow about their friends of\nBurgdale with the love of a dog; also they were, divers of them,\nsomewhat thievish, and if they lacked anything would liefer take it\nby stealth than ask for it; which forsooth the Burgdale men took not\namiss, but deemed of it as a jest rather.\n\nVery few of the Runaways had any will to fare back to their old\nhomes, or indeed could be got to go into the wood, or, after a day or\ntwo, to say any word of Rose-dale or Silver-dale.  In this and other\nmatters the Burgdalers dealt with them as with children who must have\ntheir way; for they deemed that their guests had much time to make\nup; also they were well content when they saw how goodly they were,\nfor these Dalesmen loved to see men goodly of body and of a cheerful\ncountenance.\n\nAs for Dallach and the three Silver-dale men of the kindred, they\nwent gladly whereas the Burgdale men would have them; and half a\nscore others took weapons in their hands when the war was foughten:\nconcerning which more hereafter.\n\nBut on the even whereof the tale now tells, Face-of-god and Stone-\nface and their company met after nightfall in the Hall of the Face\nclad in glorious raiment, and therewith were Dallach and the men of\nSilver-dale, washen and docked of their long hair, after the fashion\nof warriors who bear the helm; and they were clad in gay attire, with\nbattle-swords girt to their sides and gold rings on their arms.\nSomewhat stern and sad-eyed were those Silver-dalers yet, though they\nlooked on those about them kindly and courteously when they met their\neyes; and Face-of-god yearned towards them when he called to mind the\nbeauty and wisdom and loving-kindness of the Sun-beam.  They were, as\naforesaid, strong men and tall, and one of them taller than any\namidst that house of tall men.  Their names were Wolf-stone, the\ntallest, and God-swain, and Spear-fist; and God-swain the youngest\nwas of thirty winters, and Wolf-stone of forty.  They came into the\nHall in such wise, that when they were washed and attired, and all\nmen were assembled in the Hall, and the Alderman and the chieftains\nsitting on the dais, Face-of-god brought them in from the out-bower,\nholding Dallach by the right hand and Wolf-stone by the left; and he\nlooked but a stripling beside that huge man.\n\nAnd when the men in the Hall beheld such goodly warriors, and\nremembered their grief late past, they all stood up and shouted for\njoy of them.  But Face-of-god passed up the Hall with them, and stood\nbefore the dais and said:\n\n'O Alderman of the Dale and Chief of the House of the Face, here I\nbring to you the foes of our foemen, whom I have met in the Wild-\nwood, and bidden to our House; and meseemeth they will be our\nfriends, and stand beside us in the day of battle.  Therefore I say,\ntake these guests and me together, or put us all to the door\ntogether; and if thou wilt take them, then show them to such places\nas thou deemest meet.'\n\nThen stood up the Alderman and said:\n\n'Men of Silver-dale and Rose-dale, I bid you welcome!  Be ye our\nfriends, and abide here with us as long as seemeth good to you, and\nshare in all that is ours.  Son Face-of-god, show these warriors to\nseats on the dais beside thee, and cherish them as well as thou\nknowest how.'\n\nThen Face-of-god brought them up on to the dais and sat down on the\nright hand of his father, with Dallach on his right hand, and then\nWolf-stone out from him; then sat Stone-face, that there might be a\nman of the Dale to talk with them and serve them; and on his right\nhand first Spear-fist and then God-swain.  And when they were all sat\ndown, and the meat was on the board, Iron-face turned to his son\nFace-of-god and took his hand, and said in a loud voice, so that many\nmight hear him:\n\n'Son Face-of-god, son Gold-mane, thou bearest with thee both ill luck\nand good.  Erewhile, when thou wanderedst out into the Wild-wood,\nseeking thou knewest not what from out of the Land of Dreams, thou\ndidst but bring aback to us grief and shame; but now that thou hast\ngone forth with the neighbours seeking thy foemen, thou hast come\naback to us with thine hands full of honour and joy for us, and we\nthank thee for thy gifts, and I call thee a lucky man.  Herewith,\nkinsman, I drink to thee and the lasting of thy luck.'\n\nTherewith he stood up and drank the health of the War-leader and the\nGuests:  and all men were exceeding joyous thereat, when they called\nto mind his wrath at the Gate-thing, and they shouted for gladness as\nthey drank that health, and the feast became exceeding merry in the\nHouse of the Face; and as to the war to come, it seemed to them as if\nit were over and done in all triumph.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.  HALL-FACE GOETH TOWARD ROSE-DALE\n\n\n\nOn the morrow Face-of-god took counsel with Hall-face and Stone-face\nas to what were best to be done, and they sat on the dais in the Hall\nto talk it over.\n\nShort was the time that had worn since that day in Shadowy Vale, for\nit was but eight days since then; yet so many things had befallen in\nthat time, and, to speak shortly, the outlook for the Burgdalers had\nchanged so much, that the time seemed long to all the three, and\nespecially to Face-of-god.\n\nIt was yet twenty days till the Great Folk-mote should beholden, and\nto Hall-face the time seemed long enough to do somewhat, and he\ndeemed it were good to gather force and fall on the Dusky Men in\nRose-dale, since now they had gotten men who could lead them the\nnighest way and by the safest passes, and who knew all the ways of\nthe foemen.  But to Stone-face this rede seemed not so good; for they\nwould have to go and come back, and fight and conquer, in less time\nthan twenty days, or be belated of the Folk-mote, and meanwhile much\nmight happen.\n\n'For,' said Stone-face, 'we may deem the fighting-men of Rose-dale to\nbe little less than one thousand, and however we fall on them, even\nif it be unawares at first, they shall fight stubbornly; so that we\nmay not send against them many less than they be, and that shall\nstrip Burgdale of its fighting-men, so that whatever befalls, we that\nbe left shall have to bide at home.'\n\nNow was Face-of-god of the same mind as Stone-face; and he said\nmoreover:  'When we go to Rose-dale we must abide there a while\nunless we be overthrown.  For if ye conquer it and come away at once,\npresently shall the tidings come to the ears of the Dusky Men in\nSilver-dale, and they shall join themselves to those of Rose-dale who\nhave fled before you, and between them they shall destroy the unhappy\npeople therein; for ye cannot take them all away with you:  and that\nshall they do all the more now, when they look to have new thralls in\nBurgdale, both men and women.  And this we may not suffer, but must\nabide till we have met all our foemen and have overcome them, so that\nthe poor folk there shall be safe from them till they have learned\nhow to defend their dale.  Now my rede is, that we send out the War-\narrow at once up and down the Dale, and to the Shepherds and\nWoodlanders, and appoint a day for the Muster and Weapon-show of all\nour Folk, and that day to be the day before the Spring Market, that\nis to say, four days before the Great Folk-mote, and meantime that we\nkeep sure watch about the border of the wood, and now and again scour\nthe wood, so as to clear the Dale of their wandering bands.'\n\n'Yea,' said Hall-face; 'and I pray thee, brother, let me have an\nhundred of men and thy Dallach, and let us go somewhat deep into the\nwood towards Rose-dale, and see what we may come across; peradventure\nit might be something better than hart or wild-swine.'\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'I see no harm therein, if Dallach goeth with thee\nfreely; for I will have no force put on him or any other of the\nRunaways.  Yet meseemeth it were not ill for thee to find the road to\nRose-dale; for I have it in my mind to send a company thither to give\nthose Rose-dale man-quellers somewhat to do at home when we fall upon\nSilver-dale.  Therefore go find Dallach, and get thy men together at\nonce; for the sooner thou art gone on thy way the better.  But this I\nbid thee, go no further than three days out, that ye may be back home\nbetimes.'\n\nAt this word Hall-face's eyes gleamed with joy, and he went out from\nthe Hall straightway and sought Dallach, and found him at the Gate.\nIron-face had given him a new sword, a good one, and had bidden him\ncall it Thicket-clearer, and he would not leave it any moment of the\nday or night, but would lay it under his pillow at night as a child\ndoes with a new toy; and now he was leaning against a buttress and\ndrawing the said sword half out of the scabbard and poring over its\nblade, which was indeed fair enough, being wrought with dark grey\nwaving lines like the eddies of the Weltering Water.\n\nSo Hall-face greeted him, and smiled and said:\n\n'Guest, if thou wilt, thou may'st take that new blade of my father's\nwork which thou lovest so, a journey which shall rejoice it.'\n\n'Yea,' said Dallach, 'I suppose that thou wouldest fare on thy\nbrother's footsteps, and deemest that I am the man to lead thee on\nthe road, and even farther than he went; and though it might be\nthought by some that I have seen enough of Rose-dale and the parts\nthereabout for one while, yet will I go with thee; for now am I a man\nagain, body and soul.'\n\nAnd therewith he drew Thicket-clearer right out of his sheath and\nwaved him in the air.  And Hall-face was glad of him and said he was\nwell apaid of his help.  So they went away together to gather men,\nand on the morrow Hall-face departed and went into the Wild-wood with\nDallach and an hundred and two score men.\n\nBut as for Face-of-god, he fared up and down the Dale following the\nWar-arrow, and went into all houses, and talked with the folk, both\nyoung and old, men and women, and told them closely all that had\nbetid and all that was like to betide; and he was well pleased with\nthat which he saw and heard; for all took his words well, and were\nnought afeard or dismayed by the tidings; and he saw that they would\nnot hang aback.  Meantime the days wore, and Hall-face came not back\ntill the seventh day, and he brought with him twelve more Runaways,\nof whom five were women.  But he had lost four men, and had with him\nDallach and five others of the Dalesmen borne upon litters sore hurt;\nand this was his story:\n\nThey got to the Burg of the Runaways on the forenoon of the third\nday, and thereby came on five carles of the Runaways--men who had\nmissed meeting Dallach that other day, but knew what had been done;\nfor one of them had been sick and could not come with him, and he had\ntold the others:  so now they were hanging about the Burg of the\nRunaways hoping somewhat that he might come again; and they met the\nBurgdalers full of joy, and brought them trouts that they had caught\nin the river.\n\nAs for the other runaways, namely, five women and two more carles--\nthey had gotten them close to the entrance into Silver-dale, where by\nnight and cloud they came on a campment of the Dusky Men, who were\nleading home these seven poor wretches, runaways whom they had\ncaught, that they might slay them most evilly in Rose-stead.  So\nHall-face fell on the Dusky Men, and delivered their captives, but\nslew not all the foe, and they that fled brought pursuers on them who\ncame up with them the next day, so near was Rose-dale, though they\nmade all diligence homeward.  The Burgdalers must needs turn and\nfight with those pursuers, and at last they drave them aback so that\nthey might go on their ways home.  They let not the grass grow\nbeneath their feet thereafter, till they were assured by meeting a\nband of the Woodlanders, who had gone forth to help them, and with\nwhom they rested a little.  But neither so were they quite done with\nthe foemen, who came upon them next day a very many:  these however\nthey and the Woodlanders, who were all fresh and unwounded and very\nvaliant, speedily put to the worse; and so they came on to Burgstead,\nleaving those of them who were sorest hurt to be tended by the\nWoodlanders at Carlstead, who, as might be looked for, deal with them\nvery lovingly.\n\nIt was in the first fight that they suffered that loss of slain and\nwounded; and therein the newly delivered thralls fought valiantly\nagainst their masters:  as for Dallach, it was no marvel, said Hall-\nface, that he was hurt; but rather a marvel that he was not slain, so\nlittle he recked of point and edge, if he might but slay the foemen.\n\nSuch was Hall-face's-tale; and Face-of-god deemed that he had done\nunwisely to let him go that journey; for the slaying of a few Dusky\nMen was but a light gain to set against the loss of so many\nBurgdalers; yet was he glad of the deliverance of those Runaways, and\ndeemed it a gain indeed.  But henceforth would he hold all still till\nhe should have tidings of Folk-might; so nought was done thereafter\nsave the warding of the Dale, from the country of the Shepherds to\nthe Waste above the Eastern passes.\n\nBut Face-of-god himself went up amongst the Shepherds, and abode with\na goodman hight Hound-under-Greenbury, who gathered to him the folk\nfrom the country-side, and they went up on to Greenbury, and sat on\nthe green grass while he spoke with them and told them, as he had\ntold the others, what had been done and what should be done.  And\nthey heard him gladly, and he deemed that there would be no blenching\nin them, for they were all in one tale to live and die with their\nfriends of Burgdale, and they said that they would have no other word\nsave that to bear to the Great Folk-mote.\n\nSo he went away well-pleased, and he fared on thence to the\nWoodlanders, and guested at the house of a valiant man hight\nWargrove, who on the morrow morn called the folk together to a green\nlawn of the Wild-wood, so that there was scarce a soul of them that\nwas not there.  Then he laid the whole matter before them; and if the\nDalesmen had been merry and ready, and the Shepherds stout-hearted\nand friendly, yet were the Wood-landers more eager still, so that\nevery hour seemed long to them till they stood in their war-gear; and\nthey told him that now at last was the hour drawing nigh which they\nhad dreamed of, but had scarce dared to hope for, when the lost way\nshould be found, and the crooked made straight, and that which had\nbeen broken should be mended; that their meat and drink, and sleeping\nand waking, and all that they did were now become to them but the\nmeans of living till the day was come whereon the two remnants of the\nchildren of the Wolf should meet and become one Folk to live or die\ntogether.\n\nThen went Face-of-god back to Burgstead again, and as he stood anigh\nthe Thing-stead once more, and looked down on the Dale as he had\nbeheld it last autumn, he bethought him that with all that had been\ndone and all that had been promised, the earth was clearing of her\ntrouble, and that now there was nought betwixt him and the happy days\nof life which the Dale should give to the dwellers therein, save the\ngathering hosts of the battle-field and the day when the last word\nshould be spoken and the first stroke smitten.  So he went down on to\nthe Portway well content.\n\nThereafter till the day of the Weapon-show there is nought to tell\nof, save that Dallach and the other wounded men began to grow whole\nagain; and all men sat at home, or went on the woodland ward,\nexpecting great tidings after the holding of the Folk-mote.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.  OF THE WEAPON-SHOW OF THE MEN OF BURGDALE AND THEIR\nNEIGHBOURS\n\n\n\nNow on the day appointed for the Weapon-show came the Folk flock-meal\nto the great and wide meadow that was cleft by Wildlake as it ran to\njoin the Weltering Water.  Early in the morning, even before sunrise,\nhad the wains full of women and children begun to come thither.  Also\nthere came little horses and asses from the Shepherd country with one\nor two or three damsels or children sitting on each, and by wain-side\nor by beast strode the men of the house, merry and fair in their war-\ngear.  The Woodlanders, moreover, man and woman, elder and swain and\nyoung damsel, streamed out of the wood from Carlstead, eager to make\nthe day begin before the sunrise, and end before his setting.\n\nThen all men fell to pitching of tents and tilting over of wains; for\nthe April sun was hot in the Dale, and when he arose the meads were\ngay with more than the spring flowers; for the tents and the tilts\nwere stained and broidered with many colours, and there was none who\nhad not furbished up his war-gear so that all shone and glittered.\nAnd many wore gay surcoats over their armour, and the women were clad\nin all their bravery, and the Houses mostly of a suit; for one bore\nblue and another corn-colour, and another green, and another brazil,\nand so forth, and all gleaming and glowing with broidery of gold and\nbright hues.  But the women of the Shepherds were all clad in white,\nembroidered with green boughs and red blossoms, and the Woodland\nwomen wore dark red kirtles.  Moreover, the women had set garlands of\nflowers on their heads and the helms of the men, and for the most\npart they were slim of body and tall and light-limbed, and as dainty\nto look upon as the willow-boughs that waved on the brook-side.\n\nThither had the goodmen who were guesting the Runaways brought their\nguests, even now much bettered by their new soft days; and much the\npoor folk marvelled at all this joyance, and they scarce knew where\nthey were; but to some it brought back to their minds days of joyance\nbefore the thralldom and all that they had lost, so that their hearts\nwere heavy a while, till they saw the warriors of the kindreds\nstreaming into the mead and bethought them why they carried steel.\n\nNow by then the sun was fully up there was a great throng on the\nPortway, and this was the folk of the Burg on their way to the\nWeapon-mead.  The men-at-arms were in the midst of the throng, and at\nthe head of them was the War-leader, with the banner of the Face\nbefore him, wherein was done the image of the God with the ray-ringed\nhead.  But at the rearward of the warriors went the Alderman and the\nBurg-wardens, before whom was borne the banner of the Burg pictured\nwith the Gate and its Towers; but in the midst betwixt those two was\nthe banner of the Steer, a white beast on a green field.\n\nSo when the Dale-wardens who were down in the meadow heard the music\nand beheld who were coming, they bade the companies of the Dale and\nthe Shepherds and the Woodlanders who were down there to pitch their\nbanners in a half circle about the ingle of the meadow which was made\nby the streams of Wildlake and the Weltering Water, and gather to\nthem to be ordered there under their leaders of scores and half-\nhundreds and hundreds; and even so they did.  But the banners of the\nDale without the Burg were the Bridge, and the Bull, and the Vine,\nand the Sickle.  And the Shepherds had three banners, to wit\nGreenbury, and the Fleece, and the Thorn.\n\nAs for the Woodlanders, they said that they were abiding their great\nbanner, but it should come in good time; 'and meantime,' said they,\n'here are the war-tokens that we shall fight under; for they are good\nenough banners for us poor men, the remnant of the valiant of time\npast.'  Therewith they showed two great spears, and athwart the one\nwas tied an arrow, its point dipped in blood, its feathers singed\nwith fire; and they said, 'This is the banner of the War-shaft.'\n\nOn the other spear there was nought; but the head thereof was great\nand long, and they had so burnished the steel that the sun smote out\na ray of light from it, so that it might be seen from afar.  And they\nsaid:  'This is the Banner of the Spear!  Down yonder where the\nravens are gathering ye shall see a banner flying over us.  There\nshall fall many a mother's son.'\n\nSmiled the Dale-wardens, and said that these were good banners to\nfight under; and those that stood nearby shouted for the valiancy of\nthe Woodland Carles.\n\nNow the Dale-wardens went to the entrance from the Portway to the\nmeadow, and there met the Men of the Burg, and two of them went one\non either side of the War-leader to show him to his seat, and the\nothers abode till the Alderman and Burg-wardens came up, and then\njoined themselves to them, and the horns blew up both in the meadow\nand on the road, and the new-comers went their ways to their\nappointed places amidst the shouts of the Dalesmen; and the women and\nchildren and old men from the Burg followed after, till all the mead\nwas covered with bright raiment and glittering gear, save within the\nring of men at the further end.\n\nSo came the War-leader to his seat of green turf raised in the ingle\naforesaid; and he stood beside it till the Alderman and Wardens had\ntaken their places on a seat behind him raised higher than his; below\nhim on the step of his seat sat the Scrivener with his pen and ink-\nhorn and scroll of parchment, and men had brought him a smooth shield\nwhereon to write.\n\nOn the left side of Face-of-god stood the men of the Face all\nglittering in their arms, and amongst them were Wolf-stone and his\ntwo fellows, but Dallach was not yet whole of his hurts.  On his\nright were the folk of the House of the Steer:  the leader of that\nHouse was an old white-bearded man, grandfather of the Bride, for her\nfather was dead; and who but the Bride herself stood beside him in\nher glorious war-gear, looking as if she were new come from the City\nof the Gods, thought most men; but those who beheld her closely\ndeemed that she looked heavy-eyed and haggard, as if she were aweary.\nNevertheless, wheresoever she passed, and whosoever looked on her\n(and all men looked on her), there arose a murmur of praise and love;\nand the women, and especially the young ones, said how fair her deed\nwas, and how meet she was for it; and some of them were for doing on\nwar-gear and faring to battle with the carles; and of these some were\nsober and solemn, as was well seen afterwards, and some spake\nlightly:  some also fell to boasting of how they could run and climb\nand swim and shoot in the bow, and fell to baring of their arms to\nshow how strong they were:  and indeed they were no weaklings, though\ntheir arms were fair.\n\nThere then stood the ring of men, each company under its banner; and\nbeyond them stood the women and children and men unmeet for battle;\nand beyond them again the tilted wains and the tents.\n\nNow Face-of-god sat him down on the turf-seat with his bright helm on\nhis head and his naked sword across his knees, while the horns blew\nup loudly, and when they had done, the elder of the Dale-wardens\ncried out for silence.  Then again arose Face-of-god and said:\n\n'Men of the Dale, and ye friends of the Shepherds, and ye, O valiant\nWoodlanders; we are not assembled here to take counsel, for in three\ndays' time shall the Great Folk-mote be holden, whereat shall be\ncounsel enough.  But since I have been appointed your Chief and War-\nleader, till such time as the Folk-mote shall either yeasay or naysay\nmy leadership, I have sent for you that we may look each other in the\nface and number our host and behold our weapons, and see if we be\nmeet for battle and for the dealing with a great host of foemen.  For\nnow no longer can it be said that we are going to war, but rather\nthat war is on our borders, and we are blended with it; as many have\nlearned to their cost; for some have been slain and some sorely hurt.\nTherefore I bid you now, all ye that are weaponed, wend past us that\nthe tale of you may be taken.  But first let every hundred-leader and\nhalf-hundred-leader and score-leader make sure that he hath his tale\naright, and give his word to the captain of his banner that he in\nturn may give it out to the Scrivener with his name and the House and\nCompany that he leadeth.'\n\nSo he spake and sat him adown; and the horns blew again in token that\nthe companies should go past; and the first that came was Hall-ward\nof the House of the Steer, and the first of those that went after him\nwas the Bride, going as if she were his son.\n\nSo he cried out his name, and the name of his House, and said, 'An\nhundred and a half,' and passed forth, his men following him in most\ngoodly array.  Each man was girt with a good sword and bore a long\nheavy spear over his shoulder, save a score who bare bows; and no man\nlacked a helm, a shield, and a coat of fence.\n\nThen came a goodly man of thirty winters, and stayed before the\nScrivener and cried out:\n\n'Write down the House of the Bridge of the Upper Dale at one hundred,\nand War-well their leader.'\n\nAnd he strode on, and his men followed clad and weaponed like those\nof the Steer, save that some had axes hanging to their girdles\ninstead of swords; and most bore casting-spears instead of the long\nspears, and half a score were bowmen.\n\nThen came Fox of Upton leading the men of the Bull of Middale, an\nhundred and a half lacking two; very great and tall were his men, and\nthey also bore long spears, and one score and two were bowmen.\n\nThen Fork-beard of Lea, a man well on in years, led on the men of the\nVine, an hundred and a half and five men thereto; two score of them\nbare bow in hand and were girt with sword; the rest bore their swords\nnaked in their right hands, and their shields (which were but small\nbucklers) hanging at their backs, and in the left hand each bore two\ncasting-spears.  With these went two doughty women-at-arms among the\nbowmen, tall and well-knit, already growing brown with the spring\nsun, for their work lay among the stocks of the vines on the\nsouthward-looking bents.\n\nNext came a tall young man, yellow-haired, with a thin red beard, and\ngave himself out for Red-beard of the Knolls; he bore his father's\nname, as the custom of their house was, but the old man, who had long\nbeen head man of the House of the Sickle, was late dead in his bed,\nand the young man had not seen twenty winters.  He bade the Scrivener\nwrite the tale of the Men of the Sickle at an hundred and a half, and\nhis folk fared past the War-leader joyously, being one half of them\nbowmen; and fell shooters they were; the other half were girt with\nswords, and bore withal long ashen staves armed with great blades\ncurved inwards, which weapon they called heft-sax.\n\nAll these bands, as the name and the tale of them was declared were\ngreeted with loud shouts from their fellows and the bystanders; but\nnow arose a greater shout still, as Stone-face, clad in goodly\nglittering array, came forth and said:\n\n'I am Stone-face of the House of the Face, and I bring with me two\nhundreds of men with their best war-gear and weapons:  write it down,\nScrivener!'\n\nAnd he strode on like a young man after those who had gone past, and\nafter him came the tall Hall-face and his men, a gallant sight to\nsee:  two score bowmen girt with swords, and the others with naked\nswords waving aloft, and each bearing two casting-spears in his left\nhand.\n\nThen came a man of middle age, broad-shouldered, yellow-haired, blue-\neyed, of wide and ruddy countenance, and after him a goodly company;\nand again great was the shout that went up to the heavens; for he\nsaid:\n\n'Scrivener, write down that Hound-under-Greenbury, from amongst the\ndwellers in the hills where the sheep feed, leadeth the men who go\nunder the banner of Greenbury, to the tale of an hundred and four\nscore.'\n\nTherewith he passed on, and his men followed, stout, stark, and\nmerry-faced, girt with swords, and bearing over their shoulders long-\nstaved axes, and spears not so long as those which the Dalesmen bore;\nand they had but a half score of arrow-shot with them.\n\nNext came a young man, blue-eyed also, with hair the colour of flax\non the distaff, broad-faced and short-nosed, low of stature, but very\nstrong-built, who cried out in a loud, cheerful voice:\n\n'I am Strongitharm of the Shepherds, and these valiant men are of the\nFleece and the Thorn blended together, for so they would have it; and\ntheir tale is one hundred and two score and ten.'\n\nThen the men of those kindreds went past merry and shouting, and they\nwere clad and weaponed like to them of Greenbury, but had with them a\nscore of bowmen.  And all these Shepherd-folk wore over their\nhauberks white woollen surcoats broidered with green and red.\n\nNow again uprose the cry, and there stood before the War-leader a\nvery tall man of fifty winters, dark-faced and grey-eyed, and he\nspake slowly and somewhat softly, and said:\n\n'War-leader, this is Red-wolf of the Woodlanders leading the men who\ngo under the sign of the War-shaft, to the number of an hundred and\ntwo.'\n\nThen he passed on, and his men after him, tall, lean, and silent\namidst the shouting.  All these men bare bows, for they were keen\nhunters; each had at his girdle a little axe and a wood-knife, and\nsome had long swords withal.  They wore, everyone of the carles,\nshort green surcoats over their coats of fence; but amongst them were\nthree women who bore like weapons to the men, but were clad in red\nkirtles under their hauberks, which were of good ring-mail gleaming\nover them from throat to knee.\n\nLast came another tall man, but young, of twenty-five winters, and\nspake:\n\n'Scrivener, I am Bears-bane of the Woodlanders, and these that come\nafter me wend under the sign of the Spear, and they are of the tale\nof one hundred and seven.'\n\nAnd he passed by at once, and his men followed him, clad and weaponed\nno otherwise than they of the War-shaft, and with them were two\nwomen.\n\nNow went all those companies back to their banners, and stood there;\nand there arose among the bystanders much talk concerning the Weapon-\nshow, and who were the best arrayed of the Houses.  And of the old\nmen, some spake of past weapon-shows which they had seen in their\nyouth, and they set them beside this one, and praised and blamed.  So\nit went on a little while till the horns blew again, and once more\nthere was silence.  Then arose Face-of-god and said:\n\n'Men of Burgdale, and ye Shepherd-folk, and ye of the Woodland, now\nshall ye wot how many weaponed men we may bring together for this\nwar.  Scrivener, arise and give forth the tale of the companies, as\nthey have been told unto you.'\n\nThen the Scrivener stood up on the turf-bench beside Face-of-god, and\nspake in a loud voice, reading from his scroll:\n\n'Of the Men of Burgdale there have passed by me nine hundreds and\nsix; of the Shepherds three hundreds and eight and ten; and of the\nWoodlanders two hundreds and nine; so that all told our men are\nfourteen hundreds and thirty and three.'\n\nNow in those days men reckoned by long hundreds, so that the whole\ntale of the host was one thousand, five hundred, and four score and\none, telling the tale in short hundreds.\n\nWhen the tale had been given forth and heard, men shouted again, and\nthey rejoiced that they were so many.  For it exceeded the reckoning\nwhich the Alderman had given out at the Gate-thing.  But Face-of-god\nsaid:\n\n'Neighbours, we have held our Weapon-show; but now hold you ready,\neach man, for the Hosting toward very battle; for belike within seven\ndays shall the leaders of hundreds and twenties summon you to be\nready in arms to take whatso fortune may befall.  Now is sundered the\nWeapon-show.  Be ye as merry to-day as your hearts bid you to be.'\n\nTherewith he came down from his seat with the Alderman and the\nWardens, and they mingled with the good folk of the Dale and the\nShepherds and the Woodlanders, and merry was their converse there.\nIt yet lacked an hour of noon; so presently they fell to and feasted\nin the green meadow, drinking from wain to wain and from tent to\ntent; and thereafter they played and sported in the meads, shooting\nat the butts and wrestling, and trying other masteries.  Then they\nfell to dancing one and all, and so at last to supper on the green\ngrass in great merriment.  Nor might you have known from the\ndemeanour of any that any threat of evil overhung the Dale.  Nay, so\nglad were they, and so friendly, that you might rather have deemed\nthat this was the land whereof tales tell, wherein people die not,\nbut live for ever, without growing any older than when they first\ncome thither, unless they be born into the land itself, and then they\ngrow into fair manhood, and so abide.  In sooth, both the land and\nthe folk were fair enough to be that land and the folk thereof.\n\nBut a little after sunset they sundered, and some fared home; but\nmany of them abode in the tents and tilted wains, because the morrow\nwas the first day of the Spring Market:  and already were some of the\nWestland chapmen come; yea, two of them were with the bystanders in\nthe meadow; and more were looked for ere the night was far spent.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.  THE MEN OF SHADOWY VALE COME TO THE SPRING MARKET AT\nBURGSTEAD\n\n\n\nOn the morrow betimes in the morning the Westland chapmen, who were\nnow all come, went out from the House of the Face, where they were\never wont to be lodged, and set up their booths adown the street\nbetwixt gate and bridge.  Gay was the show; for the booths were\ntilted over with painted cloths, and the merchants themselves were\nclad in long gowns of fine cloth; scarlet, and blue, and white, and\ngreen, and black, with broidered welts of gold and silver; and their\nknaves were gaily attired in short coats of divers hues, with silver\nrings about their arms, and short swords girt to their sides.  People\nbegan to gather about these chapmen at once when they fell to opening\ntheir bales and their packs, and unloading their wains.  There had\nthey iron, both in pigs and forged scrap and nails; steel they had,\nand silver, both in ingots and vessel; pearls from over sea; cinnabar\nand other colours for staining, such as were not in the mountains:\nmadder from the marshes, and purple of the sea, and scarlet grain\nfrom the holm-oaks by its edge, and woad from the deep clayey fields\nof the plain; silken thread also from the outer ocean, and rare webs\nof silk, and jars of olive oil, and fine pottery, and scented woods,\nand sugar of the cane.  But gold they had none with them, for that\nthey took there; and for weapons, save a few silver-gilt toys, they\nhad no market.\n\nSo presently they fell to chaffer; for the carles brought them little\nbags of the river-borne gold, so that the weights and scales were at\nwork; others had with them scrolls and tallies to tell the number of\nthe beasts which they had to sell, and the chapmen gave them wares\ntherefor without beholding the beasts; for they wotted that the\nDalesmen lied not in chaffer.  While the day was yet young withal\ncame the Dalesmen from the mid and nether Dale with their wares and\nset up their booths; and they had with them flasks and kegs of the\nwine which they had to sell; and bales of the good winter-woven\ncloth, some grey, some dyed, and pieces of fine linen; and blades of\nswords, and knives, and axes of such fashion as the Westland men\nused; and golden cups and chains, and fair rings set with mountain-\nblue stones, and copper bowls, and vessels gilt and parcel-gilt, and\nmountain-blue for staining.  There were men of the Shepherds also\nwith such fleeces as they could spare from the daily chaffer with the\nneighbours.  And of the Woodlanders were four carles and a woman with\npeltries and dressed deer-skins, and a few pieces of well-carven\nwood-work for bedsteads and chairs and such like.\n\nSoon was the Burg thronged with folk in all its open places, and all\nwere eager and merry, and it could not have been told from their\ndemeanour and countenance that the shadow of a grievous trouble hung\nover them.  True it was that every man of the Dale and the neighbours\nwas girt with his sword, or bore spear or axe or other weapon in his\nhand, and that most had their bucklers at their backs and their helms\non their heads; but this was ever their custom at all meetings of\nmen, not because they dreaded war or were fain of strife, but in\ntoken that they were free men, from whom none should take the weapons\nwithout battle.\n\nSuch were the folk of the land:  as for the chapmen, they were well-\nspoken and courteous, and blithe with the folk, as they well might\nbe, for they had good pennyworths of them; yet they dealt with them\nwithout using measureless lying, as behoved folk dealing with simple\nand proud people; and many was the tale they told of the tidings of\nthe Cities and the Plain.\n\nThere amongst the throng was the Bride in her maiden's attire, but\ngirt with the sword, going from booth to booth with her guests of the\nRunaways, and doing those poor people what pleasure she might, and\ngiving them gifts from the goods there, such as they set their hearts\non.  And the more part of the Runaways were about among the people of\nthe Fair; but Dallach, being still weak, sat on a bench by the door\nof the House of the Face looking on well-pleased at all the stir of\nfolk.\n\nHall-face was gone on the woodland ward; while Face-of-god went among\nthe folk in his most glorious attire; but he soon betook him to the\nplace of meeting without the Gate, where Stone-face and some of the\nelders were sitting along with the Alderman, beside whom sat the head\nman of the merchants, clad in a gown of fine scarlet embroidered with\nthe best work of the Dale, with a golden chaplet on his head, and a\ngood sword, golden-hilted, by his side, all which the Alderman had\ngiven to it him that morning.  These chiefs were talking together\nconcerning the tidings of the Plain, and many a tale the guest told\nto the Dalesmen, some true, some false.  For there had been battles\ndown there, and the fall of kings, and destruction of people, as oft\nbefalleth in the guileful Cities.  He told them also, in answer to\ntheir story of the Dusky Men, of how men even such-like, but riding\non horses, or drawn in wains, an host not to be numbered, had\nerewhile overthrown the hosts of the Cities of the Plain, and had\nwrought evils scarce to be told of; and how they had piled up the\nskulls of slaughtered folk into great hills beside the city-gates, so\nthat the sun might no longer shine into the streets; and how because\nof the death and the rapine, grass had grown in the kings' chambers,\nand the wolves had chased deer in the Temples of the Gods.\n\n'But,' quoth he, 'I know you, bold tillers of the soil, valiant\nscourers of the Wild-wood, that the worst that can befall you will be\nto die under shield, and that ye shall suffer no torment of the\nthrall.  May the undying Gods bless the threshold of this Gate, and\noft may I come hither to taste of your kindness!  May your race, the\nuncorrupt, increase and multiply, till your valiant men and clean\nmaidens make the bitter sweet and purify the earth!'\n\nHe spake smooth-tongued and smiling, handling the while the folds of\nhis fine scarlet gown, and belike he meant a full half of what he\nsaid; for he was a man very eloquent of speech, and had spoken with\nkings, uncowed and pleased with his speaking; and for that cause and\nhis riches had he been made chief of the chapmen.  As he spake the\nheart of Face-of-god swelled within him, and his cheek flushed; but\nIron-face sat up straight and proud, and a light smile played about\nhis face, as he said gravely:\n\n'Friend of the Westland, I thank thee for the blessing and the kind\nword.  Such as we are, we are; nor do I deem that the very Gods shall\nchange us.  And if they will be our friends, it is well; for we\ndesire nought of them save their friendship; and if they will be our\nfoes, that also shall we bear; nor will we curse them for doing that\nwhich their lives bid them to do.  What sayest thou, Face-of-god, my\nson?'\n\n'Yea, father,' said Face-of-god, 'I say that the very Gods, though\nthey slay me, cannot unmake my life that has been.  If they do deeds,\nyet shall we also do.'\n\nThe Outlander smiled as they spake, and bowed his head to Iron-face\nand Face-of-god, and wondered at their pride of heart, marvelling\nwhat they would say to the great men of the Cities if they should\nmeet them.\n\nBut as they sat a-talking, there came two men running to them from\nthe Portway, their weapons all clattering upon them, and they heard\nwithal the sound of a horn winded not far off very loud and clear;\nand the Chapman's cheek paled:  for in sooth he doubted that war was\nat hand, after all he had heard of the Dalesmen's dealings with the\nDusky Men.  And all battle was loathsome to him, nor for all the gain\nof his chaffer had he come into the Dale, had he known that war was\nlooked for.\n\nBut the chiefs of the Dalesmen stirred not, nor changed countenance;\nand some of the goodmen who were in the street nigh the Gate came\nforth to see what was toward; for they also had heard the voice of\nthe horn.\n\nThen one of those messengers came up breathless, and stood before the\nchiefs, and said:\n\n'New tidings, Alderman; here be weaponed strangers come into the\nDale.'\n\nThe Alderman smiled on him and said:  'Yea, son, and are they a great\nhost of men?'\n\n'Nay,' said the man, 'not above a score as I deem, and there is a\nwoman with them.'\n\n'Then shall we abide them here,' said the Alderman, 'and thou\nmightest have saved thy breath, and suffered them to bring tidings of\nthemselves; since they may scarce bring us war.  For no man desireth\ncertain and present death; and that is all that such a band may win\nat our hands in battle to-day; and all who come in peace are welcome\nto us.  What like are they to behold?'\n\nSaid the man:  'They are tall men gloriously attired, so that they\nseem like kinsmen of the Gods; and they bear flowering boughs in\ntheir hands.'\n\nThe Alderman laughed, and said:  'If they be Gods they are welcome\nindeed; and they shall grow the wiser for their coming; for they\nshall learn how guest-fain the Burgdale men may be.  But if, as I\ndeem, they be like unto us, and but the children of the Gods, then\nare they as welcome, and it may be more so, and our greeting to them\nshall be as their greeting to us would be.'\n\nEven as he spake the horn was winded nearer yet, and more loudly, and\nfolk came pouring out of the Gate to learn the tidings.  Presently\nthe strangers came from off the Portway into the space before the\nGate; and their leader was a tall and goodly man of some thirty\nwinters, in glorious array, helm on head and sword by side, his\nsurcoat green and flowery like the spring meads.  In his right hand\nhe held a branch of the blossomed black-thorn (for some was yet in\nblossom), and his left had hold of the hand of an exceeding fair\nwoman who went beside him:  behind him was a score of weaponed men in\ngoodly attire, some bearing bows, some long spears, but each bearing\na flowering bough in hand.\n\nThe tall man stopped in the midst of the space, and the Alderman and\nthey with him stirred not; though, as for Face-of-god, it was to him\nas if summer had come suddenly into the midst of winter, and for the\nvery sweetness of delight his face grew pale.\n\nThen the new-comer drew nigh to the Alderman and said:\n\n'Hail to the Gate and the men of the Gate!  Hail to the kindred of\nthe children of the Gods!'\n\nBut the Alderman stood up and spake:  'And hail to thee, tall man!\nFair greeting to thee and thy company!  Wilt thou name thyself with\nthine own name, or shall I call thee nought save Guest?  Welcome art\nthou, by whatsoever name thou wilt be called.  Here may'st thou and\nthy folk abide as long as ye will.'\n\nSaid the new-comer:  'Thanks have thou for thy greeting and for thy\nbidding!  And that bidding shall we take, whatsoever may come of it;\nfor we are minded to abide with thee for a while.  But know thou, O\nAlderman of the Dalesmen, that I am not sackless toward thee and\nthine.  My name is Folk-might of the Children of the Wolf, and this\nwoman is the Sun-beam, my sister, and these behind me are of my\nkindred, and are well beloved and trusty.  We are no evil men or\nwrong-doers; yet have we been driven into sore straits, wherein men\nmust needs at whiles do deeds that make their friends few and their\nfoes many.  So it may be that I am thy foeman.  Yet, if thou doubtest\nof me that I shall be a baneful guest, thou shalt have our weapons of\nus, and then mayest thou do thy will upon us without dread; and here\nfirst of all is my sword!'\n\nTherewith he cast down the flowering branch he was bearing, and\npulled his sword from out his sheath, and took it by the point, and\nheld out the hilt to Iron-face.\n\nBut the Alderman smiled kindly on him and said:\n\n'The blade is a good one, and I say it who know the craft of sword-\nforging; but I need it not, for thou seest I have a sword by my side.\nKeep your weapons, one and all; for ye have come amongst many and\nthose no weaklings:  and if so be that thy guilt against us is so\ngreat that we must needs fall on you, ye will need all your war-gear.\nBut hereof is no need to speak till the time of the Folk-mote, which\nwill be holden in three days' wearing; so let us forbear this matter\ntill then; for I deem we shall have enough to say of other matters.\nNow, Folk-might, sit down beside me, and thou also, Sun-beam, fairest\nof women.'\n\nTherewith he looked into her face and reddened, and said:\n\n'Yet belike thou hast a word of greeting for my son, Face-of-god,\nunless it be so that ye have not seen him before?'\n\nThen Face-of-god came forward, and took Folk-might by the hand and\nkissed him; and he stood before the Sun-beam and took her hand, and\nthe world waxed a wonder to him as he kissed her cheeks; and in no\nwise did she change countenance, save that her eyes softened, and she\ngazed at him full kindly from the happiness of her soul.\n\nThen Face-of-god said:  'Welcome, Guests, who erewhile guested me so\nwell:  now beginneth the day of your well-doing to the men of\nBurgdale; therefore will we do to you as well as we may.'\n\nThen Folk-might and the Sun-beam sat them down with the chieftains,\none on either side of the Alderman, but Face-of-god passed forth to\nthe others, and greeted them one by one:  of them was Wood-father and\nhis three sons, and Bow-may; and they rejoiced exceedingly to see\nhim, and Bow-may said:\n\n'Now it gladdens my heart to look upon thee alive and thriving, and\nto remember that day last winter when I met thee on the snow, and\nturned thee back from the perilous path to thy pleasure, which the\nDusky Men were besetting, of whom thou knewest nought.  Yea, it was\nmerry that tide; but this is better.  Nay, friend,' she said, 'it\navaileth thee nought to strive to look out of the back of thine head:\nlet it be enough to thee that she is there.  Thou art now become a\ngreat chieftain, and she is no less; and this is a meeting of\nchieftains, and the folk are looking on and expecting demeanour of\nthem as of the Gods; and she is not to be dealt with as if she were\nthe daughter of some little goodman with whom one hath made tryst in\nthe meadows.  There! hearken to me for a while; at least till I tell\nthee that thou seemest to me to hold thine head higher than when last\nI saw thee; though that is no long time either.  Hast thou been in\nbattle again since that day?'\n\n'Nay,' he said, 'I have stricken no stroke since I slew two felons\nwithin the same hour that we parted.  And thou, sister, what hast\nthou done?'\n\nShe said:  'The grey goose hath been on the wing thrice since that,\nbearing on it the bane of evil things.'\n\nThen said Wood-wise:  'Kinswoman, tell him of that battle, since thou\nart deft with thy tongue.'\n\nShe said:  'Weary on battles! it is nought save this:  twelve days\nagone needs must every fighting-man of the Wolf, carle or of queen,\nwend away from Shadowy Vale, while those unmeet for battle we hid\naway in the caves at the nether end of the Dale:  but Sun-beam would\nnot endure that night, and fared with us, though she handled no\nweapon.  All this we had to do because we had learned that a great\ncompany of the Dusky Men were over-nigh to our Dale, and needs must\nwe fall upon them, lest they should learn too much, and spread the\nstory.  Well, so wise was Folk-might that we came on them unawares by\nnight and cloud at the edge of the Pine-wood, and but one of our men\nwas slain, and of them not one escaped; and when the fight was over\nwe counted four score and ten of their arm-rings.'\n\nHe said:  'Did that or aught else come of our meeting with them that\nmorning?'\n\n'Nay,' she said, 'nought came of it:  those we slew were but a\nstraying band.  Nay, the four score and ten slain in the Pine-wood\nknew not of Shadowy Vale belike, and had no intent for it:  they were\nbut scouring the wood seeking their warriors that had gone out from\nSilver-dale and came not aback.'\n\n'Thou art wise in war, Bow-may,' said Face-of-god, and he smiled\nwithal.\n\nBow-may reddened and said:  'Friend Gold-mane, dost thou perchance\ndeem that there is aught ill in my warring?  And the Sun-beam, she\nnaysayeth the bearing of weapons; though I deem that she hath little\nfear of them when they come her way.'\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'Nay, I deem no ill of it, but much good.  For I\nsuppose that thou hast learned overmuch of the wont of the Dusky Men,\nand hast seen their thralls?'\n\nShe knitted her brows, and all the merriment went out of her face at\nthat word, and she answered:  'Yea, thou hast it; for I have both\nseen their thralls and been in the Dale of thralldom; and how then\ncan I do less than I do?  But for thee, I perceive that thou hast\nbeen nigh unto our foes and hast fallen in with their thralls; and\nthat is well; for whatso tales we had told thee thereof it is like\nthou wouldst not have trowed in, as now thou must do, since thou\nthyself hast seen these poor folk.  But now I will tell thee, Gold-\nmane, that my soul is sick of these comings and goings for the\nslaughter of a few wretches; and I long for the Great Day of Battle,\nwhen it will be seen whether we shall live or die; and though I laugh\nand jest, yet doth the wearing of the days wear me.'\n\nHe looked kindly on her and said:  'I am War-leader of this Folk, and\ntrust me that the waiting-tide shall not be long; wherefore now,\nsister, be merry to-day, for that is but meet and right; and cast\naside thy care, for presently shalt thou behold many new friends.\nBut now meseemeth overlong have ye been standing before our Gate, and\nit is time that ye should see the inside of our Burg and the inside\nof our House.'\n\nIndeed by this time so many men had come out of the street that the\nplace before the Gate was all thronged, and from where he stood Face-\nof-god could scarce see his father, or Folk-might and the Sun-beam\nand the chieftains.\n\nSo he took Wood-father by the hand, and close behind him came Wood-\nwise and Bow-may, and he cried out for way that he might speak with\nthe Alderman, and men gave way to them, and he led those new-comers\nclose up to the gate-seats of the Elders, and as he clove the press\nsmiling and bright-eyed and happy, all gazed on him; but the Sun-\nbeam, who was sitting between Iron-face and the Westland Chapman, and\nwho heretofore had been agaze with eyes beholding little, past whose\nears the words went unheard, and whose mind wandered into thoughts of\nthings unfashioned yet, when she beheld him close to her again, then,\ntaken unawares, her eyes caressed him, and she turned as red as a\nrose, as she felt all the sweetness of desire go forth from her to\nmeet him.  So that, he perceiving it, his voice was the clearer and\nsweeter for the inward joy he felt, as he said:\n\n'Alderman, meseemeth it is now time that we bring our Guests into the\nHouse of our Fathers; for since they are in warlike array, and we are\nno longer living in peace, and I am now War-leader of the Dale, I\ndeem it but meet that I should have the guesting of them.  Moreover,\nwhen we are come into our House, I will bid thee look into thy\ntreasury, that thou may'st find therein somewhat which it may\npleasure us to give to our Guests.'\n\nSaid Iron-face:  'Thou sayest well, son, and since the day is now\nworn past noon, and these folk are but just come from the Waste,\ntherefore such as we have of meat and drink abideth them.  And surely\nthere is within our house a coffer which belongeth to thee and me;\nand forsooth I know not why we keep the treasures hoarded therein,\nsave that it be for this cause:  that if we were to give to our\nfriends that which we ourselves use and love, which would be of all\nthings pleasant to us, if we gave them such goods, they would be worn\nand worsened by our use of them.  For this reason, therefore, do we\nkeep fair things which we use not, so that we may give them to our\nfriends.\n\n'Now, Guests, both of the Waste and the Westland, since here is no\nGate-thing or meeting of the Dale-wardens, and we sit here but for\nour pleasure, let us go take our pleasure within doors for a while,\nif it seem good to you.'\n\nTherewith he arose, and the folk made way for him and his Guests; and\nFolk-might went on the right hand of Iron-face, and beside him went\nthe Chapman, who looked on him with a half-smile, as though he knew\nsomewhat of him.  But on the other side of Iron-face went the Sun-\nbeam, whose hand he held, and after these came Face-of-god, leading\nin the rest of the New-comers, who yet held the flowery branches in\ntheir hands.\n\nNow so much had Face-of-god told the Dalesmen, that they deemed they\nall knew these men for their battle-fellows of whom they had heard\ntell; and this the more as the men were so goodly and manly of\naspect, especially Folk-might, so that they seemed as if they were\nnigh akin to the Gods.  As for the Sun-beam, they knew not how to\npraise her beauty enough, but they said that they had never known\nbefore how fair the Gods might be.  So they raised a great shout of\nwelcome as the men came through the Gate into the Burg, and all men\nturned their backs on the booths, so eager were they to behold\nclosely these new friends.\n\nBut as the Guests went from the Gate to the House of the Face, going\nvery slowly because of the press, there in the front of the throng\nstood the Bride with the women of the Runaways, whom she had caused\nto be clad very fairly; and she was fain to do them a pleasure by\nbringing them to sight of these new-comers, of whom she had not heard\nwho they were, though she had heard the cry that strangers were at\nhand.  So there she stood smiling a little with the pleasure of\nshowing a fair sight to the poor people, as folk do with children.\nBut when she saw those twain going on each side of the Alderman she\nknew them at once; and when the Sun-beam, who was on his left side,\npassed so close to her that she could see the very smoothness and\ndainty fashion of her skin, then was she astonied, and the world\nseemed strange to her, and till they were gone by, and for a while\nafterwards, she knew not where she was nor what she did, though it\nseemed to her as if she still saw the face of that fair woman as in a\npicture.\n\nBut the Sun-beam had noted her at first, even amongst the fair women\nof Burgstead, and she so steady and bright beside the wandering\ntimorous eyes and lowering faces of the thralls.  But suddenly, as\neye met eye, she saw her face change; she saw her cheek whiten, her\neyes stare, and her lips quiver, and she knew at once who it was; for\nshe had not seen her before as Folk-might had.  Then the Sun-beam\ncast her eyes adown, lest her compassion might show in her face, and\nbe a fresh grief to her that had lost the wedding and the love; and\nso she passed on.\n\nAs for Folk-might, he had seen her at once amongst all that folk as\nhe came into the street, and in sooth he was looking for her; and\nwhen he saw her face change, as the sight of the Sun-beam smote upon\nher heart, his own face burned with shame and anger, and he looked\nback at her as he went toward the House.  But she saw him not, nor\nnoted him; and none deemed it strange that he looked long on the\nBride, the treasure of Burgstead.  But for some while Folk-might was\nfew-spoken and sharp-spoken amongst the chieftains; for he was slow\nto master his longing and his wrath.\n\nSo when all the Guests had entered the door of the House of the Face,\nthe Alderman turned back, and, standing on the threshold of his\nHouse, spake unto the throng:\n\n'Men of the Dale, and ye Outlanders who may be here, know that this\nis a happy day; for hither have come to us Guests, men of the kindred\nof the Gods, and they are even those of whom Face-of-god my son hath\ntold you.  And they are friends of our friends and foes of our foes.\nThese men are now in my House, as is but right; but when they come\nforth I look to you to cherish them in the best way ye know, and make\nmuch of them, as of those who may help us and who may by us be\nholpen.'\n\nTherewith he went in again and into the Hall, and bade show the New-\ncomers to the dais; and wine of the best, and meat such as was to\nhand, was set before them.  He bade men also get ready high feast as\ngreat as might be against the evening; and they did his bidding\nstraightway.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.  THE ALDERMAN GIVES GIFTS TO THEM OF SHADOWY VALE\n\n\n\nIn the Hall of the Face Folk-might sat on the dais at the right hand\nof the Alderman, and the Sun-beam on his left hand.  But Iron-face\nalso had beheld the Bride how her face changed, and he knew the\ncause, and was grieved and angry and ashamed thereof:  also he\nbethought him how this stranger was sitting in the very place where\nthe Bride used to sit, and of all the love, as of a very daughter,\nthat he had had for her; howbeit he constrained himself to talk\ncourteously and kindly both to Folk-might and\n\nthe Sun-beam, as behoved the Chief of the House and the Alderman of\nthe Dale.  Moreover, he was not a little moved by the goodliness and\nwisdom of the Sun-beam and the manliness of Folk-might, who was the\nmost chieftain-like of men.\n\nBut while they sat there Face-of-god went from man to man of the\nGuests, and made much of each, but especially of Wood-father and his\nsons and Bow-may, and they loved him, and praised him, and deemed him\nthe best of hall-mates.  Nor might the Sun-beam altogether refrain\nher from looking lovingly on him, and it could be seen of her that\nshe deemed he was doing well, and like a wise leader and chieftain.\n\nSo wore away awhile, and men were fulfilled of meat and drink; so\nthen the Alderman arose and spake, and said:\n\n'Is it not so, Guests, that ye would now gladly behold our market,\nand the goodly wares which the chapmen have brought us from the\nCities?'\n\nThen most men cried out:  'Yea, yea!' and Iron-face said:\n\n'Then shall ye go, nor be holden by me from your pleasure.  And ye\nkinsmen who are the most guest-fain and the wisest, go ye with our\nfriends, and make all things easy and happy for them.  But first of\nall, Guests, I were well pleased if ye would take some small matters\nout of our abundance; for it were well that ye see them ere ye stand\nbefore the chapmen's booths, lest ye chaffer with them for what ye\nhave already.'\n\nThey all praised his bounty and thanked him for his goodwill:  so he\narose to go to his treasury, and bade certain of his folk go along\nwith him to bear in the gifts.  But ere he had taken three steps down\nthe hall, Face-of-god prevented him and said:\n\n'Kinsman, if thou hast anywhere a hauberk somewhat better than folk\nare wont to bear, such as thine own hand fashioneth, and a sword of\nthe like stuff, I would have thee give them, the sword to my brother-\nin-arms Wood-wise here, and the war-coat to my sister Bow-may, who\nshooteth so well in the bow that none may shoot closer, and very few\nas close; and her shaft it was that delivered me when my skull was\namongst the axes of the Dusky Men:  else had I not been here.'\n\nThereat Bow-may reddened and looked down, like a scholar who hath\nbeen over-praised for his learning and diligence; but the Alderman\nsmiled on her and said:\n\n'I thank thee, son, that thou hast let me know what these our two\nfriends may be fain of:  and as for this damsel-at-arms, it is a\nlittle thing that thou askest for her, and we might have found her\nsomething more worthy of her goodliness; yet forsooth, since we are\nall bound for the place where shafts and staves shall be good cheap,\na greater treasure might be of less avail to her.'\n\nThereat men laughed, and the Alderman went down the Hall with those\nbearers of gifts, and was away for a space while they drank and made\nmerry:  but presently back they came from the treasury bearing loads\nof goodly things which were laid on one of the endlong boards.  Then\nbegan the gift-giving:  and first he gave unto Folk-might six golden\ncups marvellously fashioned, the work of four generations of wrights\nin the Dale, and he himself had wrought the last two thereof.  To\nSun-beam he gave a girdle of gold, fashioned with great mastery,\nwhereon were images of the Gods and the Fathers, and warriors, and\nbeasts of the field and fowls of the air; and as he girt it about her\nloins, he said in a soft voice so that few heard:\n\n'Sun-beam, thou fair woman, time has been when thou wert to us as the\nedge of the poisonous sword or the midnight torch of the murderer;\nbut now I know not how it will be, or if the grief which thou hast\ngiven me will ever wear out or not.  And now that I have beheld thee,\nI have little to do to blame my son; for indeed when I look on thee I\ncannot deem that there is any evil in thee.  Yea, however it may be,\ntake thou this gift as the reward of thine exceeding beauty.'\n\nShe looked on him with kind eyes, and said meekly:\n\n'Indeed, if I have hurt thee unwittingly, I grieve to have hurt so\ngood a man.  Hereafter belike we may talk more of this, but now I\nwill but say, that whereas at first I needed but to win thy son's\ngoodwill, so that our Folk might come to life and thriving again, now\nit is come to this, that he holdeth my heart in his hand and may do\nwhat he will with it; therefore I pray thee withhold not thy love\neither from him or from me.'\n\nHe looked on her wondering, and said:  'Thou art such an one as might\nmake the old man young, and the boy grow into manhood suddenly; and\nthy voice is as sweet as the voice of the song-birds singing in the\ndawn of early summer soundeth to him who hath been sick unto death,\nbut who hath escaped it and is mending.  And yet I fear thee.'\n\nTherewith he kissed her hand and turned unto the others, and he gave\nunto Bow-may a hauberk of ring-mail of his own fashioning, a sure\ndefence and a wonderful work, and the collar thereof was done with\ngold and gems.\n\nBut he said to her:  'Fair damsel-at-arms, faithful is thy face, and\nthe fashion of thee is goodly:  now art thou become one of the best\nof our friends, and this is little enough to give thee; yet would we\nfain ward thy body against the foeman; so grieve us not by gainsaying\nus.'\n\nAnd Bow-may was exceeding glad, and scarce knew how to cease handling\nthat marvel of ring-mail.\n\nThen to Wood-wise Iron-face gave a most goodly sword, the blade all\nmarked with dark lines like the stream of an eddying river, the hilts\nof steel and gold marvellously wrought; and all the work of a smith\nwho had dwelt in the house of his father's father, and was a great\nwarrior.\n\nUnto Wood-father he gave a very goodly helm parcel-gilded; and to his\nsons and the other folk fair gifts of weapons and jewels and girdles\nand cups and other good things; so that their hearts were full of\njoy, and they all praised his open hand.\n\nThen some of the best and merriest of the kinsmen of the Face, and\nFace-of-god with them, brought the Guests out into the street and\namong the booths.  There Face-of-god beheld the Bride again; and she\nwas standing by the booth of a chapman and dealing with him for a\npiece of goodly silken cloth to be a gown for one of her guests, and\nshe was talking and smiling as she chaffered with him, as her wont\nwas; for she was ever very friendly of demeanour with all men.  But\nhe noted that she was yet exceeding pale, and he was right sorry\nthereof, for he loved her friendly; yet now had he no shame for all\nthat had befallen, when he bethought him of the Sun-beam and the love\nshe had for him.  And also he had a deeming that the Bride would\nbetter of her grief.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.  THE CHIEFTAINS TAKE COUNSEL IN THE HALL OF THE FACE\n\n\n\nThen turned Face-of-god back into the Hall, and saw where Iron-face\nsat at the dais, and with him Folk-might and Stone-face and the Elder\nof the Dale-wardens, and Sun-beam withal; so he went soberly up to\nthe board, and sat himself down thereat beside Stone-face, over\nagainst Folk-might and his father, beside whom sat the Sun-beam; and\nFolk-might looked on him gravely, as a man powerful and trustworthy,\nyet was his look somewhat sour.\n\nThen the Alderman said:  'My son, I said not to thee come back\npresently, because I wotted that thou wouldst surely do so, knowing\nthat we have much to speak of.  For, whatever these thy friends may\nhave done, or whatsoever thou hast done with them to grieve us, all\nthat must be set aside at this present time, since the matter in hand\nis to save the Dale and its folk.  What sayest thou hereon?  Since,\nyoung as thou mayst be, thou art our War-leader, and doubtless shalt\nso be after the Folk-mote hath been holden.'\n\nFace-of-god answered not hastily:  indeed, as he sat thinking for a\nminute or two, the fair spring day seemed to darken about them or to\nglare into the light of flames amidst the night-tide; and the joyous\nclamour without doors seemed to grow hoarse and fearful as the sound\nof wailing and shrieking.  But he spake firmly and simply in a clear\nvoice, and said:\n\n'There can be no two words concerning what we have to aim at; these\nDusky Men we must slay everyone, though we be fewer than they be.'\n\nFolk-might smiled and nodded his head; but the others sat staring\ndown the hall or into the hangings.\n\nThen spake Folk-might:  'Thou wert a boy methought when I cast my\nspear at thee last autumn, Face-of-god, but now hast thou grown into\na man.  Now tell me, what deemest thou we must do to slay them all?'\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'Once again it is clear that we must fall upon\nthem at home in Rose-dale and Silver-dale.'\n\nAgain Folk-might nodded:  but Iron-face said:\n\n'Needeth this?  May we not ward the Dale and send many bands into the\nwood to fall upon them when we meet them?  Yea, and so doing these\nour guests have already slain many, as this valiant man hath told me\ne'en now.  Will ye not slay so many at last, that they shall learn to\nfear us, and abide at home and leave us at peace?'\n\nBut Face-of-god said:  'Meseemeth, father, that this is not thy rede,\nand that thou sayest this but to try me:  and perchance ye have been\ntalking about me when I was without in the street e'en now.  Even if\nit might be that we should thus cow these felons into abiding at home\nand tormenting their own thralls at their ease, yet how then are our\nfriends of the Wolf holpen to their own again?  And I shall tell thee\nthat I have promised to this man and this woman that I will give them\nno less than a man's help in this matter.  Moreover, I have spoken in\nevery house of the Dale, and to the Shepherds and the Woodlanders,\nand there is no man amongst them but will follow me in the quarrel.\nFurthermore, they have heard of the thralldom that is done on men no\ngreat way from their own houses; yea, they have seen it; and they\nremember the old saw, \"Grief in thy neighbour's hall is grief in thy\ngarth,\" and sure it is, father, that whether thou or I gainsay them,\ngo they will to deliver the thralls of the Dusky Men, and will leave\nus alone in the Dale.'\n\n'This is no less than sooth,' said the Dale-warden, 'never have men\ngone forth more joyously to a merry-making than all men of us shall\nwend to this war.'\n\n'But,' said Face-of-god, 'of one thing ye may be sure, that these men\nwill not abide our pleasure till we cut them all off in scattered\nbands, nor will they sit deedless at home.  Nor indeed may they; for\nwe have heard from their thralls that they look to have fresh tribes\nof them come to hand to eat their meat and waste their servants, and\nthese and they must find new abodes and new thralls; and they are now\nwarned by the overthrows and slayings that they have had at our hands\nthat we are astir, and they will not delay long, but will fall upon\nus with all their host; it might even be to-day or to-morrow.'\n\nSaid Folk-might:  'In all this thou sayest sooth, brother of the\nDale; and to cut this matter short, I will tell you all, that\nyesterday we had with us a runaway from Silver-dale (it is overlong\nto tell how we fell in with her; for it was a woman).  But she told\nus that this very moon is a new tribe come into the Dale, six long\nhundreds in number, and twice as many more are looked for in two\neights of days, and that ere this moon hath waned, that is, in\ntwenty-four days, they will wend their ways straight for Burgdale,\nfor they know the ways thereto.  So I say that Face-of-god is right\nin all wise.  But tell me, brother, hast thou thought of how we shall\ncome upon these men?'\n\n'How many men wilt thou lead into battle?' said Face-of-god.\n\nFolk-might reddened, and said:  'A few, a few; maybe two-hundreds all\ntold.'\n\n'Yea,' said Face-of-god, 'but some special gain wilt thou be to us.'\n\n'So I deem at least,' said Folk-might.\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'Good is that.  Now have we held our Weapon-show\nin the Dale, and we find that we together with you be sixteen long\nhundreds of men; and the tale of the foemen that be now in Silver-\ndale, new-comers and all, shall be three thousands or thereabout, and\nin Rose-dale hard on a thousand.'\n\n'Scarce so many,' said Folk-might; 'some of the felons have died; we\ntold over our silver arm-rings yesterday, and the tale was three\nhundred and eighty and six.  Besides, they were never so many as thou\ndeemest.'\n\n'Well,' said Face-of-god, 'yet at least they shall outnumber us\nsorely.  We may scarce leave the Dale unguarded when our host is\ngone; therefore I deem that we shall have but one thousand of men for\nour onslaught on Silver-dale.'\n\n'How come ye to that?' said Stone-face.\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'Abide a while, fosterer!  Though the odds between\nus be great, it is not to be hidden that I wot how ye of the Wolf\nknow of privy passes into Silver-dale; yea, into the heart thereof;\nand this is the special gain ye have to give us.  Therefore we, the\nthousand men, falling on the foe unawares, shall make a great\nslaughter of them; and if the murder be but grim enough, those\nthralls of theirs shall fear us and not them, as already they hate\nthem and not us, so that we may look to them for rooting out these\nsorry weeds after the overthrow.  And what with one thing, what with\nanother, we may cherish a good hope of clearing Silver-dale at one\nstroke with the said thousand men.\n\n'There remaineth Rose-dale, which will be easier to deal with,\nbecause the Dusky Men therein are fewer and the thralls as many:\nthat also would I fall on at the same time as we fall on Silver-dale\nwith the men that are left over from the Silver-dale onslaught.\nWherefore my rede is, that we gather all those unmeet for battle in\nthe field into this Burg, with ten tens of men to strengthen them;\nwhich shall be enough for them, along with the old men, and lads, and\nsturdy women, to defend themselves till help comes, if aught of evil\nbefall, or to flee into the mountains, or at the worst to die\nvaliantly.  Then let the other five hundreds fare up to Rose-dale,\nand fall on the Dusky Men therein about the same time, but not before\nour onslaught on Silver-dale:  thus shall hand help foot, so that\nstumbling be not falling; and we may well hope that our rede shall\nthrive.'\n\nThen was he silent, and the Sun-beam looked upon him with gleaming\neyes and parted lips, waiting eagerly to hear what Folk-might would\nsay.  He held his peace a while, drumming on the board with his\nfingers, and none else spake a word.  At last he said:\n\n'War-leader of Burgdale, all that thou hast spoken likes me well, and\neven so must it be done, saving that parting of our host and sending\none part to fall upon Rose-dale.  I say, nay; let us put all our\nmight into that one stroke on Silver-dale, and then we are undone\nindeed if we fail; but so shall we be if we fail anywise; but if we\nwin Silver-dale, then shall Rose-dale lie open before us.'\n\n'My brother,' said Face-of-god, 'thou art a tried warrior, and I but\na lad:  but dost thou not see this, that whatever we do, we shall not\nat one onslaught slay all the Dusky Men of Silver-dale, and those\nthat flee before us shall betake them to Rose-dale, and tell all the\ntale, and what shall hinder them then from falling on Burgdale (since\nthey are no great way from it) after they have murdered what they\nwill of the unhappy people under their hands?'\n\nSaid Folk-might:  'I say not but that there is a risk thereof, but in\nwar we must needs run such risks, and all should be risked rather\nthan that our blow on Silver-dale be light.  For we be the fewer; and\nif the foemen have time to call that to mind, then are we all lost.'\n\nSaid Stone-face:  'Meseemeth, War-leader, that there is nought much\nto dread in leaving Rose-dale to itself for a while; for not only may\nwe follow hard on the fleers if they flee to Rose-dale, and be there\nno long time after them, before they have time to stir their host but\nalso after the overthrow we shall be free to send men back to\nBurgdale by way of Shadowy Vale.  I deem that herein Folk-might hath\nthe right of it.'\n\n'Even so say I,' said the Alderman; 'besides, we might theft leave\nmore folk behind us for the warding of the Dale.  So, son, the risk\nwhereof thou speakest groweth the lesser the longer it is looked on.'\n\nThen spake the Dale-warden:  'Yet saving your wisdom, Alderman, the\nrisk is there yet.  For if these felons come into the Dale at all,\neven if the folk left behind hold the Burg and keep themselves\nunmurdered, yet may they not hinder the foe from spoiling our\nhomesteads; so that our folk coming back in triumph shall find ruin\nat home, and spend weary days in hunting their foemen, who shall,\nmany of them, escape into the Wild-wood.'\n\n'Yea,' said the Sun-beam, 'sooth is that; and Face-of-god is wise to\nthink of it and of other matters.  Yet one thing we must bear in\nmind, that all may not go smoothly in our day's work in Silver-dale;\nso we must have force there to fall back on, in case we miss our\nstroke at first.  Therefore, I say, send we no man to Rose-dale, and\nleave we no able man-at-arms behind in the Burg, so that we have with\nus every blade that may be gathered.'\n\nIron-face smiled and said:  'Thou art wise, damsel; and I marvel that\nso fair-fashioned a thing as thou can think so hardly of the meeting\nof the fallow blades.  But hearken! will not the Dusky Men hear that\nwe have stripped the Dale of fighting-men, and may they not then give\nour host the go-by and send folk to ruin us?'\n\nThere was silence while Face-of-god looked down on the board; but\npresently he lifted up his face and said:\n\n'Folk-might was right when he said that all must be risked.  Let us\nleave Rose-dale till we have overcome them of Silver-dale.  Moreover,\nmy father, thou must not deem of these felons as if they were of like\nwits to us, to forecast the deeds to come, and weigh the chances\nnicely, and unravel tangled clews.  Rather they move like to the\nstares in autumn, or the winter wild-geese, and will all be thrust\nforward by some sting that entereth into their imaginations.\nTherefore, if they have appointed one moon to wear before they fall\nupon us, they will not stir till then, and we have time enough to do\nwhat must be done.  Wherefore am I now of one mind with the rest of\nyou.  Now meseemeth it were well that these things which we have\nspoken here, and shall speak, should not be noised abroad openly;\nnay, at the Folk-mote it would be well that nought be said about the\nday or the way of our onslaught on Silver-dale, lest the foe take\nwarning and be on their guard.  Though, sooth to say, did I deem that\nif they had word of our intent they of Rose-dale would join\nthemselves to them of Silver-dale, and that we should thus have all\nour foes in one net, then were I fain if the word would reach them.\nFor my soul loathes the hunting that shall befall up and down the\nwood for the slaying of a man here, and two or three there, and the\nwearing of the days in wandering up and down with weapons in the\nhand, and the spinning out of hatred and delaying of peace.'\n\nThen Iron-face reached his hand across the board and took his son's\nhand, and said:\n\n'Hail to thee, son, for thy word!  Herein thou speakest as if from my\nvery soul, and fain am I of such a War-leader.'\n\nAnd desire drew the eyes of the Sun-beam to Face-of-god, and she\nbeheld him proudly.  But he said:\n\n'All hath been spoken that the others of us may speak; and now it\nfalleth to the part of Folk-might to order our goings for the tryst\nfor the onslaught, and the trysting-place shall be in Shadowy Vale.\nHow sayest thou, Chief of the Wolf?'\n\nSaid Folk-might:  'I have little to say; and it is for the War-leader\nto see to this closely and piecemeal.  I deem, as we all deem, that\nthere should be no delay; yet were it best to wend not all together\nto Shadowy Vale, but in divers bands, as soon as ye may after the\nFolk-mote, by the sure and nigh ways that we shall show you.  And\nwhen we are gathered there, short is the rede, for all is ready there\nto wend by the passes which we know throughly, and whereby it is but\ntwo days' journey to the head of Silver-dale, nigh to the caves of\nthe silver, where the felons dwell the thickest.'\n\nHe set his teeth, and his colour came and went:  for as constantly as\nthe onslaught had been in his mind, yet whenever he spake of the\ngreat day of battle, hope and joy and anger wrought a tumult in his\nsoul; and now that it was so nigh withal, he could not refrain his\njoy.\n\nBut he spake again:  'Now therefore, War-leader, it is for thee to\norder the goings of thy folk.  But I will tell thee that they shall\nnot need to take aught with them save their weapons and victual for\nthe way, that is, for thirty hours; because all is ready for them in\nShadowy Vale, though it be but a poor place as to victual.  Canst\nthou tell us, therefore, what thou wilt do?'\n\nFace-of-god had knit his brows and become gloomy of countenance; but\nnow his face cleared, and he set his hand to his pouch, and drew\nforth a written parchment, and said:\n\n'This is the order whereof I have bethought me.  Before the Folk-mote\nI and the Wardens shall speak to the leaders of hundreds, who be\nmostly here at the Fair, and give them the day and the hour whereon\nthey shall, each hundred, take their weapons and wend to Shadowy\nVale, and also the place where they shall meet the men of yours who\nshall lead them across the Waste.  These hundred-leaders shall then\ngo straightway and give the word to the captains of scores, and the\ncaptains of scores to the captains of tens; and if, as is scarce\ndoubtful, the Folk-mote yea-says the onslaught and the fellowship\nwith you of the Wolf, then shall those leaders of tens bring their\nmen to the trysting-place, and so go their ways to Shadowy Vale.  Now\nhere I have the roll of our Weapon-show, and I will look to it that\nnone shall be passed over; and if ye ask me in what order they had\nbest get on the way, my rede is that a two hundred should depart on\nthe very evening of the day of the Folk-mote, and these to be of our\nfolk of the Upper Dale; and on the morning of the morrow of the Folk-\nmote another two hundreds from the Dale; and in the evening of the\nsame day the folk of the Shepherds, three hundreds or more, and that\nwill be easy to them; again on the next day two more bands of the\nLower Dale, one in the morning, one in the evening.  Lastly, in the\nearliest dawn of the third day from the Folk-mote shall the\nWoodlanders wend their ways.  But one hundred of men let us leave\nbehind for the warding of the Burg, even as we agreed before.  As for\nthe place of tryst for the faring over the Waste, let it be the end\nof the knolls just by the jaws of the pass yonder, where the\nWeltering Water comes into the Dale from the East.  How say ye?'\n\nThey all said, and Folk-might especially, that it was right well\ndevised, and that thus it should be done.\n\nThen turned Face-of-god to the Dale-warden, and said:\n\n'It were good, brother, that we saw the other wardens as soon as may\nbe, to do them to wit of this order, and what they have to do.'\n\nTherewith he arose and took the Elder of the Dale-wardens away with\nhim, and the twain set about their business straight-way.  Neither\ndid the others abide long in the Hall, but went out into the Burg to\nsee the chapmen and their wares.  There the Alderman bought what he\nneeded of iron and steel and other matters; and Folk-might cheapened\nhim a dagger curiously wrought, and a web of gold and silk for the\nSun-beam, for which wares he paid in silver arm-rings, new-wrought\nand of strange fashion.\n\nBut amidst of the chaffer was now a great ring of men; and in the\nmidst of the ring stood Redesman, fiddle and bow in hand, and with\nhim were four damsels wondrously arrayed; for the first was clad in a\nsmock so craftily wrought with threads of green and many colours,\nthat it seemed like a piece of the green field beset with primroses\nand cowslips and harebells and windflowers, rather than a garment\nwoven and sewn; and in her hand she bore a naked sword, with golden\nhilts and gleaming blade.  But the second bore on her roses done in\nlike manner, both blossoms and green leaves, wherewith her body was\ncovered decently, which else had been naked.  The third was clad as\nthough she were wading the wheat-field to the waist, and above was\nwrapped in the leaves and bunches of the wine-tree.  And the fourth\nwas clad in a scarlet gown flecked with white wool to set forth the\nwinter's snow, and broidered over with the burning brands of the Holy\nHearth; and she bore on her head a garland of mistletoe.  And these\nfour damsels were clearly seen to image the four seasons of the year-\n-Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.  But amidst them stood a\nfountain or conduit of gilded work cunningly wrought, and full of the\nbest wine of the Dale, and gilded cups and beakers hung about it.\n\nSo now Redesman fell to caressing his fiddle with the bow till it\nbegan to make sweet music, and therewith the hearts of all danced\nwith it; and presently words come into his mouth, and he fell to\nsinging; and the damsels answered him:\n\n\nEarth-wielders, that fashion the Dale-dwellers' treasure,\n   Soft are ye by seeming, yet hardy of heart!\nNo warrior amongst us withstandeth your pleasure;\n   No man from his meadow may thrust you apart.\n\nFresh and fair are your bodies, but far beyond telling\n   Are the years of your lives, and the craft ye have stored.\nCome give us a word, then, concerning our dwelling,\n   And the days to befall us, the fruit of the sword.\n\nWinter saith:\n\nWhen last in the feast-hall the Yule-fire flickered,\n   The foot of no foeman fared over the snow,\nAnd nought but the wind with the ash-branches bickered:\n   Next Yule ye may deem it a long time ago.\n\nAutumn saith:\n\nLoud laughed ye last year in the wheat-field a-smiting;\n   And ye laughed as your backs drave the beam of the press.\nWhen the edge of the war-sword the acres are lighting\n   Look up to the Banner and laugh ye no less.\n\nSummer saith:\n\nYe called and I came, and how good was the greeting,\n   When ye wrapped me in roses both bosom and side!\nHere yet shall I long, and be fain of our meeting,\n   As hidden from battle your coming I bide.\n\nSpring saith:\n\nI am here for your comfort, and lo! what I carry;\n   The blade with the bright edges bared to the sun.\nTo the field, to the work then, that e'en I may tarry\n   For the end of the tale in my first days begun!\n\n\nTherewith the throng opened, and a young man stepped lightly into the\nring, clad in very fair armour, with a gilded helm on his head; and\nhe took the sword from the hand of the Maiden of Spring, and waved it\nin the air till the westering sun flashed back from it.  Then each of\nthe four damsels went up to the swain and kissed his mouth; and\nRedesman drew the bow across the strings, and the four damsels sang\ntogether, standing round about the young warrior:\n\n\nIt was but a while since for earth's sake we trembled,\n   Lest the increase our life-days had won for the Dale,\nAll the wealth that the moons and the years had assembled,\n   Should be but a mock for the days of your bale.\n\nBut now we behold the sun smite on the token\n   In the hand of the Champion, the heart of a man;\nWe look down the long years and see them unbroken;\n   Forth fareth the Folk by the ways it began.\n\nSo bid ye these chapmen in autumn returning,\n   To bring iron for ploughshares and steel for the scythe,\nAnd the over-sea oil that hath felt the sun's burning,\n   And fair webs for your women soft-spoken and blithe;\n\nAnd pledge ye your word in the market to meet them,\n   As many a man and as many a maid,\nAs eager as ever, as guest-fain to greet them,\n   And bide till the booth from the waggon is made.\n\nCome, guests of our lovers! for we, the year-wielders,\n   Bid each man and all to come hither and take\nA cup from our hands midst the peace of our shielders,\n   And drink to the days of the Dale that we make.\n\n\nThen went the damsels to that wine-fountain, and drew thence cups of\nthe best and brightest wine of the Dale, and went round about the\nring, and gave drink to whomsoever would, both of the chapmen and the\nothers; while the weaponed youth stood in the midst bearing aloft his\nsword and shield like an image in a holy place, and Redesman's bow\nstill went up and down the strings, and drew forth a sweet and merry\ntune.\n\nGreat game it was now to see the stark Burgdale carles dragging the\nMen of the Plain, little loth, up to the front of the ring, that they\nmight stretch out their hands for a cup, and how many a one, as he\ntook it, took as much as he might of the damsel's hand withal.  As\nfor the damsels, they played the Holy Play very daintily, neither\nreddening nor laughing, but faring so solemnly, and withal so sweetly\nand bright-faced, that it might well have been deemed that they were\nin very sooth Maidens of the God of Earth sent from the ever-enduring\nHall to cheer the hearts of men.\n\nSo simply and blithely did the Men of Burgdale disport them after the\nmanner of their fathers, trusting in their valour and beholding the\ngood days to be.\n\nSo wore the evening, and when night was come, men feasted throughout\nthe Burg from house to house, and every hall was full.  But the\nGuests from Shadowy Vale feasted in the Hall of the Face in all glee\nand goodwill; and with them were the chief of the chapmen and two\nothers; but the rest of them had been laid hold of by goodmen of the\nBurg, and dragged into their feast-halls, for they were fain of those\nguests and their tales.  One of the chapmen in the House of the Face\nknew Folk-might, and hailed him by the name he had borne in the\nCities, Regulus to wit; indeed, the chief chapman knew him, and even\nsomewhat over-well, for he had been held to ransom by Folk-might in\nthose past days, and even yet feared him, because he, the chapman,\nhad played somewhat of a dastard's part to him.  But the other was an\nopen-hearted and merry fellow, and no weakling; and Folk-might was\nfain of his talk concerning times bygone, and the fields they had\nfoughten in, and other adventures that had befallen them, both good\nand evil.\n\nAs for Face-of-god, he went about the Hall soberly, and spake no more\nthan behoved him, so as not to seem a mar-feast; for the image of the\nslaughter to be yet abode with him, and his heart foreboded the\nafter-grief of the battle.  He had no speech with the Sun-beam till\nmen were sundering after the feast, and then he came close to her\namidst of the turmoil, and said:\n\n'Time presses on me these days; but if thou wouldest speak with me\nto-morrow as I would with thee, then mightest thou go on the Bridge\nof the Burg about sunrise, and I will be there, and we two only.'\n\nHer face, which had been somewhat sad that evening (for she had been\nwatching his), brightened at that word, and she took his hand as folk\ncame thronging round about them, and said:\n\n'Yea, friend, I shall be there, and fain of thee.'  And therewithal\nthey sundered for that night.\n\nAnd all men went to sleep throughout the Burg:  howbeit they set a\nwatch at the Burg-Gate; and Hall-face, when he was coming back from\nthe woodland ward about sunset, fell in with Redcoat of Waterless and\nfour score men on the Portway coming to meet him and take his place.\nAll which was clean contrary to the wont of the Burgdalers, who at\nmost whiles held no watch and ward, not even in Fair-time.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.  FACE-OF-GOD TALKETH WITH THE SUN-BEAM\n\n\n\nFace-of-God was at the Bridge on the morrow before sun-rising, and as\nhe turned about at the Bridge-foot he saw the Sun-beam coming down\nthe street; and his heart rose to his mouth at the sight of her, and\nhe went to meet her and took her by the hand; and there were no words\nbetween them till they had kissed and caressed each other, for there\nwas no one stirring about them.  So they went over the Bridge into\nthe meadows, and eastward of the beaten path thereover.\n\nThe grass was growing thick and strong, and it was full of flowers,\nas the cowslip and the oxlip, and the chequered daffodil, and the\nwild tulip:  the black-thorn was well-nigh done blooming, but the\nhawthorn was in bud, and in some places growing white.  It was a fair\nmorning, warm and cloudless, but the night had been misty, and the\nhaze still hung about the meadows of the Dale where they were\nwettest, and the grass and its flowers were heavy with dew, so that\nthe Sun-beam went barefoot in the meadow.  She had a dark cloak cast\nover her kirtle, and had left her glittering gown behind her in the\nHouse.\n\nThey went along hand in hand exceeding fain of each other, and the\nsun rose as they went, and the long beams of gold shone through the\ntops of the tall trees across the grass they trod, and a light wind\nrose up in the north, as Face-of-god stayed a moment and turned\ntoward the Face of the Sun and prayed to Him, while the Sun-beam's\nhand left the War-leader's hand and stole up to his golden locks and\nlay amongst them.\n\nPresently they went on, and the feet of Face-of-god led him unwitting\ntoward the chestnut grove by the old dyke where he had met the Bride\nsuch a little while ago, till he bethought whither he was going and\nstopped short and reddened; and the Sun-beam noted it, but spake not;\nbut he said:  'Hereby is a fair place for us to sit and talk till the\nday's work beginneth.'\n\nSo then he turned aside, and soon they came to a hawthorn brake out\nof which arose a great tall-stemmed oak, showing no green as yet save\na little on its lower twigs; and anigh it, yet with room for its\nboughs to grow freely, was a great bird-cherry tree, all covered now\nwith sweet-smelling white blossoms.  There they sat down on the trunk\nof a tree felled last year, and she cast off her cloak, and took his\nface between her two hands and kissed him long and fondly, and for a\nwhile their joy had no word.  But when speech came to them, it was\nshe that spake first and said:\n\n'Gold-mane, my dear, sorely I wonder at thee and at me, how we are\nchanged since that day last autumn when I first saw thee.  Whiles I\nthink, didst thou not laugh when thou wert by thyself that day, and\nmock at me privily, that I must needs take such wisdom on myself, and\nlesson thee standing like a stripling before me.  Dost thou not call\nit all to mind and make merry over it, now that thou art become a\ngreat chieftain and a wise warrior, and I am yet what I always was, a\nyoung maiden of the kindred; save that now I abide no longer for my\nlove?'\n\nHer face was exceeding bright and rippled with joyous smiles, and he\nlooked at her and deemed that her heart was overflowing with\nhappiness, and he wondered at her indeed that she was so glad of him,\nand he said:\n\n'Yea, indeed, oft do I see that morning in the woodland hall and thee\nand me therein, as one looketh on a picture; yea verily, and I laugh,\nyet is it for very bliss; neither do I mock at all.  Did I not deem\nthee a God then? and am I not most happy now when I can call it thus\nto mind?  And as to thee, thou wert wise then, and yet art thou wise\nnow.  Yea, I thought thee a God; and if we are changed, is it not\nrather that thou hast lifted me up to thee, and not come down to me?'\n\nYet therewithal he knit his brows somewhat and said:\n\n'Yet thou hast not to tell me that all thy love for thy Folk, and thy\nyearning hope for its recoverance, was but a painted show.  Else why\nshouldst thou love me the better now that I am become a chieftain,\nand therefore am more meet to understand thy hope and thy sorrow?\nDid I not behold thee as we stood before the Wolf of the Hall of\nShadowy Vale, how the tears stood in thine eyes as thou beheldest\nhim, and thine hand in mine quivered and clung to me, and thou wert\nall changed in a moment of time?  Was all this then but a seeming and\na beguilement?'\n\n'O young man,' she said, 'hast thou not said it, that we stood there\nclose together, and my hand in thine and desire growing up in me?\nDost thou not know how this also quickeneth the story of our Folk,\nand our goodwill towards the living, and remembrance of the dead?\nShall they have lived and desired, and we deny desire and life?  Or\ntell me:  what was it made thee so chieftain-like in the Hall\nyesterday, so that thou wert the master of all our wills, for as\nself-willed as some of us were?  Was it not that I, whom thou deemest\nlovely, was thereby watching thee and rejoicing in thee?  Did not the\nsweetness of thy love quicken thee?  Yet because of that was thy\nwarrior's wisdom and thy foresight an empty show?  Heedest thou\nnought the Folk of the Dale?  Wouldest thou sunder from the children\nof the Fathers, and dwell amongst strangers?'\n\nHe kissed her and smiled on her and said:  'Did I not say of thee\nthat thou wert wiser than the daughters of men?  See how wise thou\nhast made me!'\n\nShe spake again:  'Nay, nay, there was no feigning in my love for my\npeople.  How couldest thou think it, when the Fathers and the kindred\nhave made this body that thou lovest, and the voice of their songs is\nin the speech thou deemest sweet?'\n\nHe said:  'Sweet friend, I deemed not that there was feigning in\nthee:  I was but wondering what I am and how I was fashioned, that I\nshould make thee so glad that thou couldst for a while forget thy\nhope of the days before we met.'\n\nShe said:  'O how glad, how glad!  Yet was I nought hapless.  In\ndespite of all trouble I had no down-weighing grief, and I had the\nhope of my people before me.  Good were my days; but I knew not till\nnow how glad a child of man may be.'\n\nTheir words were hushed for a while amidst their caresses.  Then she\nsaid:\n\n'Gold-mane, my friend, I mocked not my past self because I deem that\nI was a fool then, but because I see now that all that my wisdom\ncould do, would have come about without my wisdom; and that thou,\ndeeming thyself something less than wise, didst accomplish the thing\nI craved, and that which thou didst crave also; and withal wisdom\nembraced thee, along with love.'\n\nTherewith she cast her arms about him and said:\n\n'O friend, I mock myself of this:  that erst thou deemedst me a God\nand fearedst me, but now thou seemest to me to be a God, and I fear\nthee.  Yea, though I have longed so sore to be with thee since the\nday of Shadowy Vale, and though I have wearied of the slow wearing of\nthe days, and it hath tormented me; yet now that I am with thee, I\nbless the torment of my longing; for it is but my longing that\ncompelleth me to cast away my fear of thee and caress thee, because I\nhave learned how sweet it is to love thee thus.'\n\nHe wound his arms about her, and sweeter was their longing than mere\njoy; and though their love was beyond measure, yet was therein no\nshame to aught, not even to the lovely Dale and that fair season of\nspring, so goodly they were among the children of men.\n\nIn a while they arose and turned homeward, and went over the open\nmeadow, and it was yet early, and the dew was as heavy on the grass\nas before, though the wide sunlight was now upon it, glittering on\nthe wet blades, and shining through the bells of the chequered\ndaffodils till they looked like gouts of blood.\n\n'Look,' said Sun-beam, as they went along by the same way whereas\nthey came, 'deemest thou not that other speech-friends besides us\nhave been abroad to talk together apart on this morning of the eve of\nbattle.  It is nought unwonted, that we do, even though we forget the\ntrouble of the people to think of our own joy for a while.'\n\nThe smile died out of her face as she spoke, and she said:\n\n'O friend, this much may I say for myself in all sooth, that indeed I\nwould die for the kindred and its good days, nor falter therein; but\nif I am to die, might I but die in thine arms!'\n\nHe looked very lovingly on her, and put his arm about her and kissed\nher and said:  'What ails us to stand in the doom-ring and bear\nwitness against ourselves before the kindred?  Now I will say, that\nwhatsoever the kindred may or can call upon me to do, that will I do,\nnor grudge the deed:  I am sackless before them.  But that is true\nwhich I spake to thee when we came together up out of Shadowy Vale,\nto wit, that I am no strifeful man, but a peaceful; and I look to it\nto win through this war, and find on the other side either death, or\nlife amongst a happy folk; and I deem that this is mostly the mind of\nour people.'\n\nShe said:  'Thou shalt not die, thou shalt not die!'\n\n'Mayhappen not,' he said; 'yet yesterday I could not but look into\nthe slaughter to come, and it seemed to me a grim thing, and darkened\nthe day for me; and I grew acold as a man walking with the dead.  But\ntell me:  thou sayest I shall not die; dost thou say this only\nbecause I am become dear to thee, or dost thou speak it out of thy\nforesight of things to come?'\n\nShe stopped and looked silently a while over the meadows towards the\nhouses of the Thorp:  they were standing now on the border of a\nshallow brook that ran down toward the Weltering Water; it had a\nlittle strand of fine sand like the sea-shore, driven close together,\nand all moist, because that brook was used to flood the meadow for\nthe feeding of the grass; and the last evening the hatches which held\nup the water had been drawn, so that much had ebbed away and left the\nstrand aforesaid.\n\nAfter a while the Sun-beam turned to Face-of-god, and she was become\nsomewhat pale; she said:\n\n'Nay, I have striven to see, and can see nought save the picture of\nhope and fear that I make for myself.  So it oft befalleth foreseeing\nwomen, that the love of a man cloudeth their vision.  Be content,\ndear friend; it is for life or death; but whichso it be, the same for\nme and thee together?'\n\n'Yea,' he said, 'and well content I am; so now let each of us trust\nin the other to be both good and dear, even as I trusted in thee the\nfirst hour that I looked on thee.'\n\n'It is well,' she said; 'it is well.  How fair thou art; and how fair\nis the morn, and this our Dale in the goodly season; and all this\nabideth us when the battle is over.'\n\nOnce more her voice became sweet and wheedling, and the smile lit up\nher face again, and she pointed down to the sand with her finger, and\nsaid:\n\n'See thou!  Here indeed have other lovers passed by across the brook.\nShall we wish them good luck?'\n\nHe laughed and looked down on the sand, and said:\n\n'Thou art in haste to make a story up.  Indeed I see that these first\nfootprints are of a woman, for no carle of the Dale has a foot as\nsmall; for we be tall fellows; and these others withal are a man's\nfootprints; and if they showed that they had been walking side by\nside, simple had been thy tale; but so it is not.  I cannot say that\nthese two pairs of feet went over the brook within five minutes of\neach other; but sure it is that they could not have been faring side\nby side.  Well, belike they were lovers bickering, and we may wish\nthem luck out of that.  Truly it is well seen that Bow-may hath done\nthine hunting for thee, dear friend; or else wouldest thou have\nlacked venison; for thou hast no hunter's eye.'\n\n'Well,' she said, 'but wish them luck, and give me thine hand upon\nit.'\n\nHe took her hand, and fondled it, and said:  'By this hand of my\nspeech-friend, I wish these twain all luck, in love and in leisure,\nin faring and fighting, in sowing and samming, in getting and giving.\nIs it well enough wished?  If so it be, then come thy ways, dear\nfriend; for the day's work is at hand.'\n\n'It is well wished,' she said.  'Now hearken:  by the valiant hand of\nthe War-leader, by the hand that shall unloose my girdle, I wish\nthese twain to be as happy as we be.'\n\nHe made as if to draw her away, but she hung aback to set the print\nof her foot beside the woman's foot, and then they went on together,\nand soon crossed the Bridge, and came home to the House of the Face.\n\nWhen they had broken their fast, Face-of-god would straight get to\nhis business of ordering matters for the warfare, and was wishful to\nspeak with Folk-might; but found him not, either in the House or the\nstreet.  But a man said:\n\n'I saw the tall Guest come abroad from the House and go toward the\nBridge very early in the morning.'\n\nThe Sun-beam, who was anigh when that was spoken, heard it and\nsmiled, and said:  'Gold-mane, deemest thou that it was my brother\nwhom we blessed?'\n\n'I wot not,' he said; 'but I would he were here, for this gear must\nspeedily be looked to.'\n\nNevertheless it was nigh an hour before Folk-might came home to the\nHouse.  He strode in lightly and gaily, and shaking the crest of his\nwar-helm as he went.  He looked friendly on Face-of-god, and said to\nhim:\n\n'Thou hast been seeking me, War-leader; but grudge it not that I have\ncaused thee to tarry.  For as things have gone, I am twice the man\nfor thine helping that I was yester-eve; and thou art so ready and\ndeft, that all will be done in due time.'\n\nHe looked as if he would have had Face-of-god ask of him what made\nhim so fain, but Face-of-god said only:\n\n'I am glad of thy gladness; but now let us dally no longer, for I\nhave many folk to see to-day and much to set a-going.'\n\nSo therewith they spake together a while, and then went their ways\ntogether toward Carlstead and the Woodlanders.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.  FOLK-MIGHT SPEAKETH WITH THE BRIDE\n\n\n\nIt must be told that those footprints which Face-of-god and the Sun-\nbeam had blessed betwixt jest and earnest had more to do with them\nthan they wotted of.  For Folk-might, who had had many thoughts and\nlongings since he had seen the Bride again, rose up early about\nsunrise, and went out-a-doors, and wandered about the Burg, letting\nhis eyes stray over the goodly stone houses and their trim gardens,\nyet noting them little, since the Bride was not there.\n\nAt last he came to where there was an open place, straight-sided,\nlonger than it was wide, with a wall on each side of it, over which\nshowed the blossomed boughs of pear and cherry and plum-trees:  on\neither hand before the wall was a row of great lindens, now showing\ntheir first tender green, especially on their lower twigs, where they\nwere sheltered by the wall.  At the nether end of this place Folk-\nmight saw a grey stone house, and he went towards it betwixt the\nlindens, for it seemed right great, and presently was but a score of\npaces from its door, and as yet there was no man, carle or queen,\nstirring about it.\n\nIt was a long low house with a very steep roof; but belike the hall\nwas built over some undercroft, for many steps went up to the door on\neither hand; and the doorway was low, with a straight lintel under\nits arch.  This house, like the House of the Face, seemed ancient and\nsomewhat strange, and Folk-might could not choose but take note of\nit.  The front was all of good ashlar work, but it was carven all\nover, without heed being paid to the joints of the stones, into one\npicture of a flowery meadow, with tall trees and bushes in it, and\nfowl perched in the trees and running through the grass, and sheep\nand kine and oxen and horses feeding down the meadow; and over the\ndoor at the top of the stair was wrought a great steer bigger than\nall the other neat, whose head was turned toward the sun-rising and\nuplifted with open mouth, as though he were lowing aloud.  Exceeding\nfair seemed that house to Folk-might, and as though it were the\ndwelling of some great kindred.\n\nBut he had scarce gone over it with his eyes, and was just about to\ndraw nigher yet to it, when the door at the top of those steps\nopened, and a woman came out of the house clad in a green kirtle and\na gown of brazil, with a golden-hilted sword girt to her side.  Folk-\nmight saw at once that it was the Bride, and drew aback behind one of\nthe trees so that she might not see him, if she had not already seen\nhim, as it seemed not that she had, for she stayed but for a moment\non the top of the stair, looking out down the tree-rows, and then\ncame down the stair and went soberly along the road, passing so close\nto Folk-might that he could see the fashion of her beauty closely, as\none looks into the work of some deftest artificer.  Then it came\nsuddenly into his head that he would follow her and see whither she\nwas wending.  'At least,' said he to himself, 'if I come not to\nspeech with her, I shall be nigh unto her, and shall see somewhat of\nher beauty.'\n\nSo he came out quietly from behind the tree, and followed her softly;\nand he was clad in no garment save his kirtle, and bare no weapons to\nclash and jingle, though he had his helm on his head for lack of a\nsofter hat.  He kept her well in sight, and she went straight onward\nand looked not back.  She went by the way whereas he had come, till\nthey were in the main street, wherein as yet was no one afoot; she\nmade her way to the Bridge, and passed over it into the meadows; but\nwhen she had gone but a few steps, she stayed a little and looked on\nthe ground, and as she did so turned a little toward Folk-might, who\nhad drawn back into the last of the refuges over the up-stream\nbuttresses.  He saw that there was a half-smile on her face, but he\ncould not tell whether she were glad or sorry.  A light wind was\nbeginning to blow, that stirred her raiment and raised a lock of hair\nthat had strayed from the golden fillet round about her head, and she\nlooked most marvellous fair.\n\nNow she looked along the grass that glittered under the beams of the\nnewly-risen sun, and noted belike how heavy the dew lay on it; and\nthe grass was high already, for the spring had been hot, and haysel\nwould be early in the Dale.  So she put off her shoes, that were of\ndeerskin and broidered with golden threads, and turned somewhat from\nthe way, and hung them up amidst the new green leaves of a hawthorn\nbush that stood nearby, and so went thwart the meadow somewhat\neastward straight from that bush, and her feet shone out like pearls\namidst the deep green grass.\n\nFolk-might followed presently, and she stayed not again, nor turned,\nnor beheld him; he recked not if she had, for then would he have come\nup with her and hailed her, and he knew that she was no foolish\nmaiden to start at the sight of a man who was the friend of her Folk.\n\nSo they went their ways till she came to the strand of the water-\nmeadow brook aforesaid, and she went through the little ripples of\nthe shallow without staying, and on through the tall deep grass of\nthe meadow beyond, to where they met the brook again; for it swept\nround the meadow in a wide curve, and turned back toward itself; so\nit was some half furlong over from water to water.\n\nShe stood a while on the brink of the brook here, which was brim-full\nand nigh running into the grass, because there was a dam just below\nthe place; and Folk-might drew nigher to her under cover of the\nthorn-bushes, and looked at the place about her and beyond her.  The\nmeadow beyond stream was very fair and flowery, but not right great;\nfor it was bounded by a grove of ancient chestnut trees, that went on\nand on toward the southern cliffs of the Dale:  in front of the\nchestnut wood stood a broken row of black-thorn bushes, now growing\ngreen and losing their blossom, and he could see betwixt them that\nthere was a grassy bank running along, as if there had once been a\nturf-wall and ditch round about the chestnut trees.  For indeed this\nwas the old place of tryst between Gold-mane and the Bride, whereof\nthe tale hath told before.\n\nThe Bride stayed scarce longer than gave him time to note all this;\nbut he deemed that she was weeping, though he could not rightly see\nher face; for her shoulders heaved, and she hung her face adown and\nput up her hands to it.  But now she went a little higher up the\nstream, where the water was shallower, and waded the stream and went\nup over the meadow, still weeping, as he deemed, and went between the\nblack-thorn bushes, and sat her down on the grassy bank with her back\nto the chestnut trees.\n\nFolk-might was ashamed to have seen her weeping, and was half-minded\nto turn him back again at once; but love constrained him, and he said\nto himself, 'Where shall I see her again privily if I pass by this\ntime and place?'  So he waited a little till he deemed she might have\nmastered the passion of tears, and then came forth from his bush, and\nwent down to the water and crossed it, and went quietly over the\nmeadow straight towards her.  But he was not half-way across, when\nshe lifted up her face from between her hands and beheld the man\ncoming.  She neither started nor rose up; but straightened herself as\nshe sat, and looked right into Folk-might's eyes as he drew near,\nthough the tears were not dry on her cheeks.\n\nNow he stood before her, and said:  'Hail to the Daughter of a mighty\nHouse!  Mayst thou live happy!'\n\nShe answered:  'Hail to thee also, Guest of our Folk!  Hast thou been\nwandering about our meadows, and happened on me perchance?'\n\n'Nay,' he said; 'I saw thee come forth from the House of the Steer,\nand I followed thee hither.'\n\nShe reddened a little, and knit her brow, and said:\n\n'Thou wilt have something to say to me?'\n\n'I have much to say to thee,' he said; 'yet it was sweet to me to\nbehold thee, even if I might not speak with thee.'\n\nShe looked on him with her deep simple eyes, and neither reddened\nagain, nor seemed wroth; then she said:\n\n'Speak what thou hast in thine heart, and I will hearken without\nanger whatsoever it may be; even if thou hast but to tell me of the\npassing folly of a mighty man, which in a month or two he will not\nremember for sorrow or for joy.  Sit here beside me, and tell me thy\nthought.'\n\nSo he sat him adown and said:  'Yea, I have much to say to thee, but\nit is hard to me to say it.  But this I will say:  to-day and\nyesterday make the third time I have seen thee.  The first time thou\nwert happy and calm, and no shadow of trouble was on thee; the second\ntime thine happy days were waning, though thou scarce knewest it; but\nto-day and yesterday thou art constrained by the bonds of grief, and\nwouldest loosen them if thou mightest.'\n\nShe said:  'What meanest thou?  How knowest thou this?  How may a\nstranger partake in my joy and my sorrow?'\n\nHe said:  'As for yesterday, all the people might see thy grief and\nknow it.  But when I beheld thee the first time, I saw thee that thou\nwert more fair and lovely than all other women; and when I was away\nfrom thee, the thought of thee and thine image were with me, and I\nmight not put them away; and oft at such and such a time I wondered\nand said to myself, what is she doing now? though god wot I was\ndealing with tangles and troubles and rough deeds enough.  But the\nsecond time I beheld thee, when I had looked to have great joy in the\nsight of thee, my heart was smitten with a pang of grief; for I saw\nthee hanging on the words and the looks of another man, who was\nlight-minded toward thee, and that thou wert troubled with the\nanguish of doubt and fear.  And he knew it not, nor saw it, though I\nsaw it.'\n\nHer face grew troubled, and the tearful passion stirred within her.\nBut she held it aback, and said, as anyone might have said it:\n\n'How wert thou in the Dale, mighty man?  We saw thee not.'\n\nHe said:  'I came hither hidden in other semblance than mine own.\nBut meddle not therewith; it availeth nought.  Let me say this, and\ndo thou hearken to it.  I saw thee yesterday in the street, and thou\nwert as the ghost of thine old gladness; although belike thou hast\nstriven with sorrow; for I see thee with a sword by thy side, and we\nhave been told that thou, O fairest of women, hast given thyself to\nthe Warrior to be his damsel.'\n\n'Yea,' she said, 'that is sooth.'\n\nHe went on:  'But the face which thou bearedst yesterday against thy\nwill, amidst all the people, that was because thou hadst seen my\nsister the Sun-beam for the first time, and Face-of-god with her,\nhand clinging to hand, lip longing for lip, desire unsatisfied, but\nglad with all hope.'\n\nShe laid hand upon hand in the lap of her gown, and looked down, and\nher voice trembled as she said:\n\n'Doth it avail to talk of this?'\n\nHe said:  'I know not:  it may avail; for I am grieved, and shall be\nwhilst thou art grieved; and it is my wont to strive with my griefs\ntill I amend them.'\n\nShe turned to him with kind eyes and said:\n\n'O mighty man, canst thou clear away the tangle which besetteth the\nsoul of her whose hope hath bewrayed her?  Canst thou make hope grow\nup in her heart?  Friend, I will tell thee that when I wed, I shall\nwed for the sake of the kindred, hoping for no joy therein.  Yea, or\nif by some chance the desire of man came again into my heart, I\nshould strive with it to rid myself of it, for I should know of it\nthat it was but a wasting folly, that should but beguile me, and\nwound me, and depart, leaving me empty of joy and heedless of life.'\n\nHe shook his head and said:  'Even so thou deemest now; but one day\nit shall be otherwise.  Or dost thou love thy sorrow?  I tell thee,\nas it wears thee and wears thee, thou shalt hate it, and strive to\nshake it off.'\n\n'Nay, nay,' she said; 'I love it not; for not only it grieveth me,\nbut also it beateth me down and belittleth me.'\n\n'Good is that,' said he.  'I know how strong thine heart is.  Now,\nwilt thou take mine hand, which is verily the hand of thy friend, and\nremember what I have told thee of my grief which cannot be sundered\nfrom thine?  Shall we not talk more concerning this?  For surely I\nshall soon see thee again, and often; since the Warrior, who loveth\nme belike, leadeth thee into fellowship with me.  Yea, I tell thee, O\nfriend, that in that fellowship shalt thou find both the seed of\nhope, and the sun of desire that shall quicken it.'\n\nTherewith he arose and stood before her, and held out to her his hand\nall hardened with the sword-hilt, and she took it, and stood up\nfacing him, and said:\n\n'This much will I tell thee, O friend; that what I have said to thee\nthis hour, I thought not to have said to any man; or to talk with a\nman of the grief that weareth me, or to suffer him to see my tears;\nand marvellous I deem it of thee, for all thy might, that thou hast\ndrawn this speech from out of me, and left me neither angry nor\nashamed, in spite of these tears; and thou whom I have known not,\nthough thou knewest me!\n\n'But now it were best that thou depart, and get thee home to the\nHouse of the Face, where I was once so frequent; for I wot that thou\nhast much to do; and as thou sayest, it will be in warfare that I\nshall see thee.  Now I thank thee for thy words and the thought thou\nhast had of me, and the pain which thou hast taken to heal my hurt:\nI thank thee, I thank thee, for as grievous as it is to show one's\nhurts even to a friend.'\n\nHe said:  'O Bride, I thank thee for hearkening to my tale; and one\nday shall I thank thee much more.  Mayest thou fare well in the Field\nand amidst the Folk!'\n\nTherewith he kissed her hand, and turned away, and went across the\nmeadow and the stream, glad at heart and blithe with everyone; for\nkindness grew in him as gladness grew.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.  OF THE FOLK-MOTE OF THE DALESMEN, THE SHEPHERD-FOLK,\nAND THE WOODLAND CARLES:  THE BANNER OF THE WOLF DISPLAYED\n\n\n\nNow came the day of the Great Folk-mote, and there was much thronging\nfrom everywhere to the Mote-stead, but most from Burgstead itself,\nwhereas few of the Dale-dwellers who had been at the Fair had gone\nback home.  Albeit some of the Shepherds and of the Dalesmen of the\nwesternmost Dale had brought light tents, and tilted themselves in in\nthe night before the Mote down in the meadows below the Mote-stead.\nFrom early morning there had been a stream of folk on the Portway\nsetting westward; and many came thus early that they might hold\nconverse with friends and well-wishers; and some that they might\ndisport them in the woods.  Men went in no ordered bands, as the\nBurgstead men at least had done on the day of the Weapon-show, save\nthat a few of them who were arrayed the bravest gathered about the\nbanners, and went with them to the Mote-stead; for all the banners\nmust needs be there.\n\nThe Folk-mote was to be hallowed-in three hours before noon, as all\nmen knew; therefore an hour before that time were all men of the Dale\nand the Shepherds assembled that might be looked for, save the\nAlderman and the chieftains with the banner of the Burg, and these\nwere not like to come many minutes before the Hallowing.  Folk were\ngathered on the Field in such wise, that the men-at-arms made a great\nring round about the Doom-ring, (albeit there were many old men\nthere, girt with swords that they should never heave up again in\nbattle), so that without that ring there was nought save women and\nchildren.  But when all the other Houses were assembled, men looked\naround, and beheld the place of the Woodlanders that it was empty;\nand they marvelled that they were thus belated.  For now all was\nready, and a watcher had gone up to the Tower on the height, and had\nwith him the great Horn of Warning, which could be heard past the\nMote-stead and a great way down the Dale:  and if he saw foes coming\nfrom the East he should blow one blast; if from the South, two; if\nfrom the West, three; if from the North, four.\n\nSo half an hour from the appointed time of Hallowing rose the rumour\nthat the Alderman was on the road, and presently they of the women\nwho were on the outside of the throng, by drawing nigh to the edge of\nthe sheer rock, could behold the Banner of the Burg on the Portway,\nand soon after could see the wain, done about with green boughs,\nwherein sat the chieftains in their glittering war-gear.  Speedily\nthey spread the tidings, and a confused shout went up into the air;\nand in a little while the wain stayed on Wildlake's Way at the bottom\nof the steep slope that went up to the Mote-stead, and the banner of\nthe Burg came on proudly up the hill.  Soon all men beheld it, and\nsaw that the tall Hall-face bore it in front of his brother Face-of-\ngod, who came on gleaming in war-gear better than most men had seen;\nwhich was indeed of his father's fashioning, and his father's gift to\nhim that morning.\n\nAfter Face-of-god came the Alderman, and with him Folk-might leading\nthe Sun-beam by the hand, and then Stone-face and the Elder of the\nDale-wardens; and then the six Burg-wardens:  as to the other Dale-\nwardens, they were in their places on the Field.\n\nSo now those who had been standing up turned their faces toward the\nAltar of the Gods, and those who had been sitting down sprang to\ntheir feet, and the confused rumour of the throng rose into a clear\nshout as the chieftains went to their places, and sat them down on\nthe turf-seats amidst the Doom-ring facing the Speech-hill and the\nAltar of the Gods.  Amidmost sat the Alderman, on his right hand\nFace-of-god, and out from him Hall-face, and then Stone-face and\nthree of the Wardens; but on his left hand sat first the two Guests,\nthen the Elder of the Dale-wardens, and then the other three Burg-\nwardens; as for the Banner of the Burg, its staff was stuck into the\nearth behind them, and the Banner raised itself in the morning wind\nand flapped and rippled over their heads.\n\nThere then they sat, and folk abided, and it still lacked some\nminutes of the due time, as the Alderman wotted by the shadow of the\ngreat standing-stone betwixt him and the Altar.  Therewithal came the\nsound of a great horn from out of the wood on the north side, and men\nknew it for the horn of the Woodland Carles, and were glad; for they\ncould not think why they should be belated; and now men stood up a-\ntiptoe and on other's shoulders to look over the heads of the women\nand children to behold their coming; but their empty place was at the\nsouthwest corner of the ring of men.\n\nSo presently men beheld them marching toward their place, cleaving\nthe throng of the women and children, a great company; for besides\nthat they had with them two score more of men under weapons than on\nthe day of the Weapon-show, all their little ones and women and\noutworn elders were with them, some on foot, some riding on oxen and\nasses.  In their forefront went the two signs of the Battle-shaft and\nthe War-spear.  But moreover, in front of all was borne a great staff\nwith the cloth of a banner wrapped round about it, and tied up with a\nhempen yarn that it might not be seen.\n\nStark and mighty men they looked; tall and lean, broad-shouldered,\ndark-faced.  As they came amongst the throng the voice of their horn\ndied out, and for a few moments they fared on with no sound save the\ntramp of their feet; then all at once the man who bare the hidden\nbanner lifted up one hand, and straightway they fell to singing, and\nwith that song they came to their place.  And this is some of what\nthey sang:\n\n\nO white, white Sun, what things of wonder\n   Hast thou beheld from thy wall of the sky!\nAll the Roofs of the Rich and the grief thereunder,\n   As the fear of the Earl-folk flitteth by!\n\nThou hast seen the Flame steal forth from the Forest\n   To slay the slumber of the lands,\nAs the Dusky Lord whom thou abhorrest\n   Clomb up to thy Burg unbuilt with hands.\n\nThou lookest down from thy door the golden,\n   Nor batest thy wide-shining mirth,\nAs the ramparts fall, and the roof-trees olden\n   Lie smouldering low on the burning earth.\n\nWhen flitteth the half-dark night of summer\n   From the face of the murder great and grim,\n'Tis thou thyself and no new-comer\n   Shines golden-bright on the deed undim.\n\nArt thou our friend, O Day-dawn's Lover?\n   Full oft thine hand hath sent aslant\nBright beams athwart the Wood-bear's cover,\n   Where the feeble folk and the nameless haunt.\n\nThou hast seen us quail, thou hast seen us cower,\n   Thou hast seen us crouch in the Green Abode,\nWhile for us wert thou slaying slow hour by hour,\n   And smoothing down the war-rough road.\n\nYea, the rocks of the Waste were thy Dawns upheaving,\n   To let the days of the years go through;\nAnd thy Noons the tangled brake were cleaving\n   The slow-foot seasons' deed to do.\n\nThen gaze adown on this gift of our giving,\n   For the WOLF comes wending frith and ford,\nAnd the Folk fares forth from the dead to the living,\n   For the love of the Lief by the light of the Sword.\n\n\nThen ceased the song, and the whole band of the Woodlanders came\npouring tumultuously into the space allotted them, like the waters\npouring over a river-dam, their white swords waving aloft in the\nmorning sunlight; and wild and strange cries rose up from amidst\nthem, with sobbing and weeping of joy.  But soon their troubled front\nsank back into ordered ranks, their bright blades stood upright in\ntheir hands before them, and folk looked on their company, and deemed\nit the very Terror of battle and Render of the ranks of war.  Right\nwell were they armed; for though many of their weapons were ancient\nand somewhat worn, yet were they the work of good smiths of old days;\nand moreover, if any of them lacked good war-gear of his own, that\nhad the Alderman and his sons made good to them.\n\nBut before the hedge of steel stood the two tall men who held in\ntheir hands the war-tokens of the Battle-shaft and the War-spear, and\nbetwixt them stood one who was indeed the tallest man of the whole\nassembly, who held the great staff of the hidden banner.  And now he\nreached up his hand, and plucked at the yarn that bound it, which of\nset purpose was but feeble, and tore it off, and then shook the staff\naloft with both hands, and shouted, and lo! the Banner of the Wolf\nwith the Sun-burst behind him, glittering-bright, new-woven by the\nwomen of the kindred, ran out in the fresh wind, and flapped and\nrippled before His warriors there assembled.\n\nThen from all over the Mote-stead arose an exceeding great shout, and\nall men waved aloft their weapons; but the men of Shadowy Vale who\nwere standing amidst the men of the Face knew not how to demean\nthemselves, and some of them ran forth into the Field and leapt for\njoy, tossing their swords into the air, and catching them by the\nhilts as they fell:  and amidst it all the Woodlanders now stood\nsilent, unmoving, as men abiding the word of onset.\n\nAs for that brother and sister:  the Sun-beam flushed red all over\nher face, and pressed her hands to her bosom, and then the passion of\ntears over-mastered her, and her breast heaved, and the tears gushed\nout of her eyes, and her body was shaken with weeping.  But Folk-\nmight sat still, looking straight before him, his eyes glittering,\nhis teeth set, his right hand clutching hard at the hilts of his\nsword, which lay naked across his knees.  And the Bride, who stood\nclad in her begemmed and glittering war-array in the forefront of the\nMen of the Steer, nigh unto the seats of the chieftains, beheld Folk-\nmight, and her face flushed and brightened, and still she looked upon\nhim.  The Alderman's face was as of one pleased and proud; yet was\nits joy shadowed as it were by a cloud of compassion.  Face-of-god\nsat like the very image of the War-god, and stirred not, nor looked\ntoward the Sun-beam; for still the thought of the after-grief of\nbattle, and the death of friends and folk that loved him, lay heavy\non his heart, for all that it beat wildly at the shouting of the men.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.  OF THE GREAT FOLK-MOTE:  ATONEMENTS GIVEN, AND MEN\nMADE SACKLESS\n\n\n\nAmidst the clamour uprose the Alderman; for it was clear to all men\nthat the Folk-mote should be holden at once, and the matters of the\nWar, and the Fellowship, and the choosing of the War-leader, speedily\ndealt with.  So the Alderman fell to hallowing in the Folk-mote:  he\nwent up to the Altar of the Gods, and took the Gold-ring off it, and\ndid it on his arm; then he drew his sword and waved it toward the\nfour airts, and spake; and the noise and shouting fell, and there was\nsilence but for him:\n\n'Herewith I hallow in this Folk-mote of the Men of the Dale and the\nSheepcotes and the Woodland, in the name of the Warrior and the\nEarth-god and the Fathers of the kindreds.  Now let not the peace of\nthe Mote be broken.  Let not man rise against man, or bear blade or\nhand, or stick or stone against any.  If any man break the Peace of\nthe Holy Mote, let him be a man accursed, a wild-beast in the Holy\nPlaces; an outcast from home and hearth, from bed and board, from\nmead and acre; not to be holpen with bread, nor flesh, nor wine; nor\nflax, nor wool, nor any cloth; nor with sword, nor shield, nor axe,\nnor plough-share; nor with horse, nor ox, nor ass; with no saddle-\nbeast nor draught-beast; nor with wain, nor boat, nor way-leading;\nnor with fire nor water; nor with any world's wealth.  Thus let him\nwho hath cast out man be cast out by man.  Now is hallowed-in the\nFolk-mote of the Men of the Dale and the Sheepcotes and the\nWoodlands.'\n\nTherewith he waved his sword again toward the four airts, and went\nand sat down in his place.  But presently he arose again, and said:\n\n'Now if man hath aught to say against man, and claimeth boot of any,\nor would lay guilt on any man's head, let him come forth and declare\nit; and the judges shall be named, and the case shall be tried this\nafternoon or to-morrow.  Yet first I shall tell you that I, the\nAlderman of the Dalesmen, doomed one Iron-face of the House of the\nFace to pay a double fine, for that he drew a sword at the Gate-thing\nof Burgstead with the intent to break the peace thereof.  Thou,\nGreen-sleeve, bring forth the peace-breaker's fine, that Iron-face\nmay lay the same on the Altar.'\n\nThen came forth a man from the men of the Face bearing a bag, and he\nbrought it to Iron-face, who went up to the Altar and poured forth\nweighed gold from the bag thereon, and said:\n\n'Warden of the Dale, come thou and weigh it!'\n\n'Nay,' quoth the Warden, 'it needeth not, no man here doubteth thee,\nAlderman Iron-face.'\n\nA murmur of yeasay went up, and none had a word to say against the\nAlderman, but they praised him rather:  also men were eager to hear\nof the war, and the fellowship, and to be done with these petty\nmatters.  Then the Alderman rose again and said:\n\n'Hath any man a grief against any other of the Kindreds of the Dale,\nor the Sheepcotes, or the Woodlands?'\n\nNone answered or stirred; so after he had waited a while, he said:\n\n'Is there any who hath any guilt to lay against a Stranger, an\nOutlander, being such a man as he deems we can come at?'\n\nThereat was a stir amongst the Men of the Fleece of the Shepherds,\nand their ranks opened, and there came forth an ill-favoured lean old\nman, long-nebbed, blear-eyed, and bent, girt with a rusty old sword,\nbut not otherwise armed.  And all men knew Penny-thumb, who had been\nransacked last autumn.  As he came forth, it seemed as if his\nneighbours had been trying to hold him back; but a stout, broad-\nshouldered man, black-haired and red-bearded, made way for the old\nman, and led him out of the throng, and stood by him; and this man\nwas well armed at all points, and looked a doughty carle.  He stood\nside by side with Penny-thumb, right in front of the men of his\nhouse, and looked about him at first somewhat uneasily, as though he\nwere ashamed of his fellow; but though many smiled, none laughed\naloud; and they forbore, partly because they knew the man to be a\ngood man, partly because of the solemn tide of the Folk-mote, and\npartly in sooth because they wished all this to be over, and were as\nmen who had no time for empty mirth.\n\nThen said the Alderman:  'What wouldest thou, Penny-thumb, and thou,\nBristler, son of Brightling?'\n\nThen Penny-thumb began to speak in a high squeaky voice:\n\n'Alderman, and Lord of the Folk!'  But therewithal Bristle, pulled\nhim back, and said:\n\n'I am the man who hath taken this quarrel upon me, and have sworn\nupon the Holy Boar to carry this feud through; and we deem, Alderman,\nthat if they who slew Rusty and ransacked Penny-thumb be not known\nnow, yet they soon may be.'\n\nAs he spake, came forth those three men of the Shepherds and the two\nDalesmen who had sworn with him on the Holy Boar.  Then up stood\nFolk-might, and came forth into the field, and said:\n\n'Bristler, son of Brightling, and ye other good men and true, it is\nbut sooth that the ransackers and the slayer may soon be known; and\nhere I declare them unto you:  I it was and none other who slew\nRusty; and I was the leader of those who ransacked Penny-thumb, and\ncowed Harts-bane of Greentofts.  As for the slaying of Rusty, I slew\nhim because he chased me, and would not forbear, so that I must\neither slay or be slain, as hath befallen me erewhile, and will\nbefall again, methinks.  As for the ransacking of Penny-thumb, I\nneeded the goods that I took, and he needed them not, since he\nneither used them, nor gave them away, and, they being gone, he hath\nlived no worser than aforetime.  Now I say, that if ye will take the\noutlawry off me, which, as I hear, ye laid upon me, not knowing me,\nthen will I handsel self-doom to thee, Bristler, if thou wilt bear\nthy grief to purse, and I will pay thee what thou wilt out of hand;\nor if perchance thou wilt call me to Holm, thither will I go, if thou\nand I come unslain out of this war.  As to the ransacking and cowing\nof Harts-bane, I say that I am sackless therein, because the man is\nbut a ruffler and a man of violence, and hath cowed many men of the\nDale; and if he gainsay me, then do I call him to the Holm after this\nwar is over; either him or any man who will take his place before my\nsword.'\n\nThen he held his peace, and man spake to man, and a murmur arose, as\nthey said for the more part that it was a fair and manly offer.  But\nBristler called his fellows and Penny-thumb to him, and they spake\ntogether; and sometimes Penny-thumb's shrill squeak was heard above\nthe deep-voiced talk of the others; for he was a man that harboured\nmalice.  But at last Bristler spake out and said:\n\n'Tall man, we know that thou art a chieftain and of good will to the\nmen of the Dale and their friends, and that want drave thee to the\nransacking, and need to the manslaying, and neither the living nor\nthe dead to whom thou art guilty are to be called good men; therefore\nwill I bring the matter to purse, if thou wilt handsel me self-doom.'\n\n'Yea, even so let it be,' quoth Folk-might; and stepped forward and\ntook Bristler by the hand, and handselled him self-doom.  Then said\nBristler:\n\n'Though Rusty was no good man, and though he followed thee to slay\nthee, yet was he in his right therein, since he was following up his\ngoodman's gear; therefore shalt thou pay a full blood-wite for him,\nthat is to say, the worth of three hundreds in weed-stuff in whatso\ngoods thou wilt.  As for the ransacking of Penny-thumb, he shall deem\nhimself well paid if thou give him our hundreds in weed-stuff for\nthat which thou didst borrow of him.'\n\nThen Penny-thumb set up his squeak again, but no man hearkened to\nhim, and each man said to his neighbour that it was well doomed of\nBristler, and neither too much nor too little.  But Folk-might bade\nWood-wont to bring thither to him that which he had borne to the\nMote; and he brought forth a big sack, and Folk-might emptied it on\nthe earth, and lo! the silver rings of the slain felons, and they lay\nin a heap on the green field, and they were the best of silver.  Then\nthe Elder of the Dale-wardens weighed out from the heap the blood-\nwite for Rusty, according to the due measure of the hundred in weed-\nstuff, and delivered it unto Bristler.  And Folk-might said:\n\n'Draw nigh now, Penny-thumb, and take what thou wilt of this gear,\nwhich I need not, and grudge not at me henceforward.'\n\nBut Penny-thumb was afraid, and abode where he was; and Bristler\nlaughed, and said:  'Take it, goodman, take it; spare not other men's\ngoods as thou dost thine own.'\n\nAnd Folk-might stood by, smiling faintly:  so Penny-thumb plucked up\na heart, and drew nigh trembling, and took what he durst from that\nheap; and all that stood by said that he had gotten a full double of\nwhat had been awarded to him.  But as for him, he went his ways\nstraight from the Mote-stead, and made no stay till he had gotten him\nhome, and laid the silver up in a strong coffer; and thereafter he\nbewailed him sorely that he had not taken the double of that which he\ntook, since none would have said him nay.\n\nWhen he was gone, the Alderman arose and said:\n\n'Now, since the fines have been paid duly and freely, according to\nthe dooming of Bristler, take we off the outlawry from Folk-might and\nhis fellows, and account them to be sackless before us.'\n\nThen he called for other cases; but no man had aught more to bring\nforward against any man, either of the kindreds or the Strangers.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.  OF THE GREAT FOLK-MOTE:  MEN TAKE REDE OF THE WAR-\nFARING, THE FELLOWSHIP, AND THE WAR-LEADER.  FOLK-MIGHT TELLETH\nWHENCE HIS PEOPLE CAME.  THE FOLK-MOTE SUNDERED\n\n\n\nNow a great silence fell upon the throng, and they stood as men\nabiding some new matter.  Unto them arose the Alderman, and said:\n\n'Men of the Dale, and ye Shepherds and Woodlanders; it is well known\nto you that we have foemen in the wood and beyond it; and now have we\ngotten sure tidings, that they will not abide at home or in the wood,\nbut are minded to fall upon us at home.  Now therefore I will not ask\nyou whether ye will have peace or war; for with these foemen ye may\nhave peace no otherwise save by war.  But if ye think with me, three\nthings have ye to determine:  first, whether ye will abide your foes\nin your own houses, or will go meet them at theirs; next, whether ye\nwill take to you as fellows in arms a valiant folk of the children of\nthe Gods, who are foemen to our foemen; and lastly, what man ye will\nhave to be your War-leader.  Now, I bid all those here assembled, to\nspeak hereof, any man of them that will, either what they may have\nconceived in their own minds, or what their kindred may have put into\ntheir mouths to speak.'\n\nTherewith he sat down, and in a little while came forth old Hall-ward\nof the House of the Steer, and stood before the Alderman, and said:\n'O Alderman, all we say:  Since war is awake we will not tarry, but\nwill go meet our foes while it is yet time.  The valiant men of whom\nthou tellest shall be our fellows, were there but three of them.  We\nknow no better War-leader than Face-of-god of the House of the Face.\nLet him lead us.'\n\nTherewith he went his ways; and next came forth War-well, and said:\n'The House of the Bridge would have Face-of-god for War-leader, these\ntall men for fellows, and the shortest way to meet the foe.'  And he\nwent back to his place.\n\nNext came Fox of Upton, and said:  'Time presses, or much might be\nspoken.  Thus saith the House of the Bull:  Let us go meet the foe,\nand take these valiant strangers for way-leaders, and Face-of-god for\nWar-leader.'  And he also went back again.\n\nThen came forth two men together, an old man and a young, and the old\nman spake as soon as he stood still:  'The Men of the Vine bid me say\ntheir will:  They will not stay at home to have their houses burned\nover their heads, themselves slain on their own hearths, and their\nwives haled off to thralldom.  They will take any man for their\nfellow in arms who will smite stark strokes on their side.  They know\nFace-of-god, and were liefer of him for War-leader than any other,\nand they will follow him wheresoever he leadeth.  Thus my kindred\nbiddeth me say, and I hight Fork-beard of Lea.  If I live through\nthis war, I shall have lived through five.'\n\nTherewith he went back to his place; but the young man lifted up his\nvoice and said:  'To all this I say yea, and so am I bidden by the\nkindred of the Sickle.  I am Red-beard of the Knolls, the son of my\nfather.'  And he went to his place again.\n\nThen came forth Stone-face, and said:  'The House of the Face saith:\nLead us through the wood, O Face-of-god, thou War-leader, and ye\nwarriors of the Wolf.  I am Stone-face, as men know, and this word\nhath been given to me by the kindred.'  And he took his place again.\n\nThen came forth together the three chiefs of the Shepherds, to wit\nHound-under-Greenbury, Strongitharm, and the Hyllier; and\nStrongitharm spake for all three, and said:\n\n'The Men of Greenbury, and they of the Fleece and the Thorn, are of\none accord, and bid us say that they are well pleased to have Face-\nof-god for War-leader; and that they will follow him and the warriors\nof the Wolf to live or die with them; and that they are ready to go\nmeet the foe at once, and will not skulk behind the walls of\nGreenbury.'\n\nTherewith the three went back again to their places.\n\nThen came forth that tall man that bare the Banner of the Wolf, when\nhe had given the staff into the hands of him who stood next.  He came\nand stood over against the seat of the chieftains; and for a while he\ncould say no word, but stood struggling with the strong passion of\nhis joy; but at last he lifted his hands aloft, and cried out in a\nloud voice:\n\n'O war, war!  O death!  O wounding and grief!  O loss of friends and\nkindred! let all this be rather than the drawing back of meeting\nhands and the sundering of yearning hearts!' and he went back hastily\nto his place.  But from the ranks of the Woodlanders ran forth a\nyoung man, and cried out:\n\n'As is the word of Red-wolf, so is my word, Bears-bane of Carlstead;\nand this is the word which our little Folk hath put into our mouths;\nand O! that our hands may show the meaning of our mouths; for nought\nelse can.'\n\nThen indeed went up a great shout, though many forebore to cry out;\nfor now were they too much moved for words or sounds.  And in special\nwas Face-of-god moved; and he scarce knew which way to look, lest he\nshould break out into sobs and weeping; for of late he had been much\namong the Woodlanders, and loved them much.\n\nThen all the noise and clamour fell, and it was to men as if they who\nhad come thither a folk, had now become an host of war.\n\nBut once again the Alderman rose up and spake:\n\n'Now have ye yeasaid three things:  That we take Face-of-god of the\nHouse of the Face for our War-leader; that we fare under weapons at\nonce against them who would murder us; and that we take the valiant\nFolk of the Wolf for our fellows in arms.'\n\nTherewith he stayed his speech, and this time the shout arose clear\nand most mighty, with the tossing up of swords and the clashing of\nweapons on shields.\n\nThen he said:  'Now, if any man will speak, here is the War-leader,\nand here is the chief of our new friends, to answer to whatso any of\nthe kindred would have answered.'\n\nThereon came forth the Fiddle from amongst the Men of the Sickle, and\ndrew somewhat nigh to the Alderman, and said:\n\n'Alderman, we would ask of the War-leader if he hath devised the\nmanner of our assembling, and the way of our war-faring, and the day\nof our hosting.  More than this I will not ask of him, because we wot\nthat in so great an assembly it may be that the foe may have some spy\nof whom we wot not; and though this be not likely, yet some folk may\nbabble; therefore it is best for the wise to be wise everywhere and\nalways.  Therefore my rede it is, that no man ask any more concerning\nthis, but let it lie with the War-leader to bring us face to face\nwith the foe as speedily as he may.'\n\nAll men said that this was well counselled.  But Face-of-god arose\nand said:  'Ye Men of the Dale, ye Shepherds and Woodlanders,\nmeseemeth the Fiddle hath spoken wisely.  Now therefore I answer him\nand say, that I have so ordered everything since the Gate-thing was\nholden at Burgstead, that we may come face to face with the foemen by\nthe shortest of roads.  Every man shall be duly summoned to the\nHosting, and if any man fail, let it be accounted a shame to him for\never.'\n\nA great shout followed on his words, and he sat down again.  But Fox\nof Upton came forth and said:\n\n'O Alderman, we have yeasaid the fellowship of the valiant men who\nhave come to us from out of the waste; but this we have done, not\nbecause we have known them, otherwise than by what our kinsman Face-\nof-god hath told us concerning them, but because we have seen clearly\nthat they will be of much avail to us in our warfare.  Now,\ntherefore, if the tall chieftain who sitteth beside thee were to do\nus to wit what he is, and whence he and his are come, it were well,\nand fain were we thereof; but if he listeth not to tell us, that also\nshall be well.'\n\nThen arose Folk-might in his place; but or ever he could open his\nmouth to speak, the tall Red-wolf strode forward bearing with him the\nBanner of the Wolf and the Sun-burst, and came and stood beside him;\nand the wind ran through the folds of the banner, and rippled it out\nabove the heads of those twain.  Then Folk-might spake and said:\n\n\n'O Men of the Dale and the Sheepcotes, I will do as ye bid me do;\nAnd fain were ye of the story if every deal ye knew.\nBut long, long were its telling, were I to tell it all:\nLet it bide till the Cup of Deliverance ye drink from hall to hall.\n\n'Like you we be of the kindreds, of the Sons of the Gods we come,\nMidst the Mid-earth's mighty Woodland of old we had our home;\nBut of older time we abided 'neath the mountains of the Earth,\nO'er which the Sun ariseth to waken woe and mirth.\n\nGreat were we then and many; but the long days wore us thin,\nAnd war, wherein the winner hath weary work to win.\nAnd the woodland wall behind us e'en like ourselves was worn,\nAnd the tramp of the hosts of the foemen adown its glades was borne\nOn the wind that bent our wheat-fields.  So in the morn we rose,\nAnd left behind the stubble and the autumn-fruited close,\nAnd went our ways to the westward, nor turned aback to see\nThe glare of our burning houses rise over brake and tree.\nBut the foe was fierce and speedy, nor long they tarried there,\nAnd through the woods of battle our laden wains must fare;\nAnd the Sons of the Wolf were minished, and the maids of the Wolf\nwaxed few,\nAs amidst the victory-singing we fared the wild-wood through.\n\n'So saith the ancient story, that west and west we went,\nAnd many a day of battle we had in brake, on bent;\nWhilst here a while we tarried, and there we hastened on,\nAnd still the battle-harvest from many a folk we won.\n\n'Of the tale of the days who wotteth?  Of the years what man can\ntell,\nWhile the Sons of the Wolf were wandering, and knew not where to\ndwell?\nBut at last we clomb the mountains, and mickle was our toil,\nAs high the spear-wood clambered of the drivers of the spoil;\nAnd tangled were the passes and the beacons flared behind,\nAnd the horns of gathering onset came up upon the wind.\nSo saith the ancient story, that we stood in a mountain-cleft,\nWhere the ways and the valleys sundered to the right hand and the\nleft.\nThere in the place of sundering all woeful was the rede;\nWe knew no land before us, and behind was heavy need.\nAs the sword cleaves through the byrny, so there the mountain flank\nCleft through the God-kin's people; and ne'er again we drank\nThe wine of war together, or feasted side by side\nIn the Feast-hall of the Warrior on the fruit of the battle-tide.\nFor there we turned and sundered; unto the North we went\nAnd up along the waters, and the clattering stony bent;\nAnd unto the South and the Sheepcotes down went our sister's sons;\nAnd O for the years passed over since we saw those valiant ones!'\n\n\nHe ceased, and laid his right hand on the banner-staff a little below\nthe left hand of Red-wolf; and men were so keen to hear each word\nthat he spake, that there was no cry nor sound of voices when he had\ndone, only the sound of the rippling banner of the Wolf over the\nheads of those twain.  The Sun-beam bowed her head now, and wept\nsilently.  But the Bride, she had drawn her sword, and held it\nupright in her hand before her, and the sun smote fire from out of\nit.\n\nThen it was but a little while before Red-wolf lifted up his voice,\nand sang:\n\n\n'Hearken a wonder, O Folk of the Field,\nHow they that did sunder stand shield beside shield!\n\nLo! the old wont and manner by fearless folk made,\nOn the Bole of the Banner the brothers' hands laid.\n\nLo! here the token of what hath betid!\nGrown whole is the broken, found that which was hid.\n\nNow one way we follow whate'er shall befall;\nAs seeketh the swallow his yesteryear's hall.\n\nSeldom folk fewer to fight-stead hath fared;\nNe'er have men truer the battle-reed bared.\n\nGrey locks now I carry, and old am I grown,\nNor looked I to tarry to meet with mine own.\n\nFor we who remember the deeds of old days\nWere nought but the ember of battle ablaze.\n\nFor what man might aid us? what deed and what day\nShould come where Weird laid us aloof from the way?\n\nWhat man save that other of Twain rent apart,\nOur war-friend, our Brother, the piece of our heart.\n\nThen hearken the wonder how shield beside shield\nThe twain that did sunder wend down to the Field!'\n\n\nNow when he had made an end, men could no longer forebear the shout;\nand it went up into the heavens, and was borne by the west-wind down\nthe Dale to the ears of the stay-at-home women and men unmeet to go\nabroad, and it quickened their blood and the spirits within them as\nthey heard it, and they smiled and were fain; for they knew that\ntheir kinsfolk were glad.\n\nBut when there was quiet on the Mote-field again, Folk-might spake\nagain and said;\n\n\n'It is sooth that my Brother sayeth, and that now again we wend,\nAll the Sons of the Wolf together, till the trouble hath an end.\nBut as for that tale of the Ancients, it saith that we who went\nTo the northward, climbed and stumbled o'er many a stony bent,\nTill we happed on that isle of the waste-land, and the grass of\nShadowy Vale,\nWhere we dwelt till we throve a little, and felt our might avail.\nThen we fared abroad from the shadow and the little-lighted hold,\nAnd the increase fell to the valiant, and the spoil to the battle-\nbold,\nAnd never a man gainsaid us with the weapons in our hands;\nAnd in Silver-dale the happy we gat us life and lands.\n\n'So wore the years o'er-wealthy; and meseemeth that ye know\nHow we sowed and reaped destruction, and the Day of the overthrow:\nHow we leaned on the staff we had broken, and put our lives in the\nhand\nOf those whom we had vanquished and the feeble of the land;\nAnd these were the stone of stumbling, and the burden not to be\nborne,\nWhen the battle-blast fell on us and our day was over-worn.\nThus then did our wealth bewray us, and left us wise and sad;\nAnd to you, bold men, it falleth once more to make us glad,\nIf so your hearts are bidding, and ye deem the deed of worth.\nSuch were we; what we shall be, 'tis yours to say henceforth.'\n\n\nHe said furthermore:  'How great we have been I have told you\nalready; and ye shall see for yourselves how little we be now.  Is it\nenough, and will ye have us for friends and brothers?  How say ye?'\n\nThey answered with shout upon shout, so that all the place and the\nwild-wood round about was full of the voice of their crying; but when\nthe clamour fell, then spake the Alderman and said:\n\n'Friend, and chieftain of the Wolf, thou mayst hear by this shouting\nof the people that we have no mind to naysay our yea-say.  And know\nthat it is not our use and manner to seek the strong for friends, and\nto thrust aside the weak; but rather to choose for our friends them\nwho are of like mind to us, men in whom we put our trust.  From\nhenceforth then there is brotherhood between us; we are yours, and ye\nare ours; and let this endure for ever!'\n\nThen were all men full of joy; and now at last the battle seemed at\nhand, and the peace beyond the battle.\n\nThen men brought the hallowed beasts all garlanded with flowers into\nthe Doom-ring, and there were they slain and offered up unto the\nGods, to wit the Warrior, the Earth-god, and the Fathers; and\nthereafter was solemn feast holden on the Field of the Folk-mote, and\nall men were fain and merry.  Nevertheless, not all men abode there\nthe feast through; for or ever the afternoon was well worn, were many\nmen wending along the Portway eastward toward the Upper Dale, each\nman in his war-gear and with a scrip hung about him; and these were\nthey who were bound for the trysting-place and the journey over the\nwaste.\n\nSo the Folk-mote was sundered; and men went to their houses, and\nthere abode in peace the time of their summoning; since they wotted\nwell that the Hosting was afoot.\n\nBut as for the Woodlanders, who were at the Mote-stead with all their\nfolk, women, children, and old men, they went not back again to\nCarlstead; but prayed the neighbours of the Middle Dale to suffer\nthem to abide there awhile, which they yeasaid with a good will.  So\nthe Woodlanders tilted themselves in, the more part of them, down in\nthe meadows below the Mote-stead, along either side of Wildlake's\nWay; but their ancient folk, and some of the women and children, the\nneighbours would have into their houses, and the rest they furnished\nwith victual and all that they needed without price, looking upon\nthem as their very guests.  For indeed they deemed that they could\nsee that these men would never return to Carlstead, but would abide\nwith the Men of the Wolf in Silver-dale, once it were won.  And this\nthey deemed but meet and right, yet were they sorry thereof; for the\nWoodlanders were well beloved of all the Dalesmen; and now that they\nhad gotten to know that they were come of so noble a kindred, they\nwere better beloved yet, and more looked upon.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.  OF THE HOSTING IN SHADOWY VALE\n\n\n\nIt was on the evening of the fourth day after the Folk-mote that\nthere came through the Waste to the rocky edge of Shadowy Vale a band\nof some fifteen score of men-at-arms, and with them a multitude of\nwomen and children and old men, some afoot, some riding on asses and\nbullocks; and with them were sumpter asses and neat laden with\nhousehold goods, and a few goats and kine.  And this was the whole\nfolk of the Woodlanders come to the Hosting in Shadowy Vale and the\nHome of the Children of the Wolf.  Their leaders of the way were\nWood-father and Wood-wont and two other carles of Shadowy Vale; and\nRed-wolf the tall, and Bears-bane and War-grove were the captains and\nchieftains of their company.\n\nThus then they entered into the narrow pass aforesaid, which was the\ningate to the Vale from the Waste, and little by little its dimness\nswallowed up their long line.  As they went by the place where the\nlowering of the rock-wall gave a glimpse of the valley, they looked\ndown into it as Face-of-god had done, but much change was there in\nlittle time.  There was the black wall of crags on the other side\nstretching down to the ghyll of the great Force; there ran the deep\ngreen waters of the Shivering Flood; but the grass which Face-of-god\nhad seen naked of everything but a few kine, thereon now the tents of\nmen stood thick.  Their hearts swelled within them as they beheld it,\nbut they forebore the shout and the cry till they should be well\nwithin the Vale, and so went down silently into the darkness.  But as\ntheir eyes caught that dim image of the Wolf on the wall of the pass,\nman pointed it out to man, and not a few turned and kissed it\nhurriedly; and to them it seemed that many a kiss had been laid on\nthat dear token since the days of old, and that the hard stone had\nbeen worn away by the fervent lips of men, and that the air of the\nmirk place yet quivered with the vows sworn over the sword-blade.\n\nBut down through the dark they went, and so came on to the stony\nscree at the end of the pass and into the Vale; and the whole Folk\nsave the three chieftains flowed over it and stood about it down on\nthe level grass of the Vale.  But those three stood yet on the top of\nthe scree, bearing the war-signs of the Shaft and the Spear, and\nbetwixt them the banner of the Wolf and the Sunburst newly displayed\nto the winds of Shadowy Vale.\n\nUp and down the Vale they looked, and saw before the tents of men the\nold familiar banners of Burgdale rising and falling in the evening\nwind.  But amidst of the Doom-ring was pitched a great banner,\nwhereon was done the image of the Wolf with red gaping jaws on a\nfield of green; and about him stood other banners, to wit, The Silver\nArm on a red field, the Red Hand on a white field, and on green\nfields both, the Golden Bushel and the Ragged Sword.\n\nAll about the plain shone glittering war-gear of men as they moved\nhither and thither, and a stream of folk began at once to draw toward\nthe scree to look on those new-comers; and amidst the helmed\nBurgdalers and the white-coated Shepherds went the tall men of the\nWolf, bare-headed and unarmed save for their swords, mingled with the\nfair strong women of the kindred, treading barefoot the soft grass of\ntheir own Vale.\n\nPresently there was a great throng gathered round about the\nWoodlanders, and each man as he joined it waved hand or weapon toward\nthem, and the joy of their welcome sent a confused clamour through\nthe air.  Then forth from the throng stepped Folk-might, unarmed save\nhis sword, and behind him was Face-of-god, in his war-gear save his\nhelm, hand in hand with the Sun-beam, who was clad in her goodly\nflowered green kirtle, her feet naked like her sisters of the\nkindred.\n\nThen Folk-might cried aloud:  'A full and free greeting to our\nbrothers!  Well be ye, O Sons of our Ancient Fathers!  And to-day are\nye the dearer to us because we see that ye have brought us a gift, to\nwit, your wives and children, and your grandsires unmeet for war.  By\nthis token we see how great is your trust in us, and that it is your\nmeaning never to sunder from us again.  O well be ye; well be ye!'\n\nThen spake Red-wolf, and said:  'Ye Sons of the Wolf, who parted from\nus of old time in that cleft of the mountains, it is our very selves\nthat we give unto you; and these are a part of ourselves; how then\nshould we leave them behind us?  Bear witness, O men of Burgdale and\nthe Sheepcotes, that we have become one Folk with the men of Shadowy\nVale, never to be sundered again!'\n\nThen all that multitude shouted with a loud voice; and when the shout\nhad died away, Folk-might spake again:\n\n'O Warriors of the Sundering, here shall your wives and children\nabide, while we go a little journey to rejoice our hearts with the\nhard handplay, and take to us that which we have missed:  and to-\nmorrow morn is appointed for this same journey, unless ye be over\nfoot-weary with the ways of the Waste.'\n\nRed-wolf smiled as he answered:  'This ye say in jest, brother; for\nye may see that our day's journey hath not been over-much for our old\nmen; how then should it weary those who may yet bear sword?  We are\nready for the road and eager for the handplay.'\n\n'This is well,' said Folk-might, 'and what was to be looked for.\nTherefore, brother, do ye and your counsel-mates come straightway to\nthe Hall of the Wolf; wherein, after ye have eaten and drunken, shall\nwe take counsel with our brethren of Burgdale and the Sheepcotes, so\nthat all may be ordered for battle!'\n\nSaid Red-wolf:  'Good is that, if we must needs abide till to-morrow;\nfor verily we came not hither to eat and drink and rest our bodies;\nbut it must be as ye will have it.'\n\nThen the Sun-beam left the hand of Face-of-god and came forward, and\nheld out both her palms to the Woodland-folk, and spake in a voice\nthat was heard afar, though it were a woman's, so clear and sweet it\nwas; and she said:\n\n'O Warriors of the Sundering, ye who be not needed in the Hall, and\nye our sisters with your little ones and your fathers, come now to us\nand down to the tents which we have arrayed for you, and there think\nfor a little that we are all at our very home that we long for and\nhave yet to win, and be ye merry with us and make us merry.'\n\nTherewith she stepped forward daintily and entered into their throng,\nand took an old man of the Woodlanders by the hand, and kissed his\ncheek and led him away, and the coming rest seemed sweet to him.  And\nthen came other women of the Vale, kind and fair and smiling, and led\naway, some an old mother of the Wood-landers, some a young wife, some\na pair of lads; and not a few forsooth kissed and embraced the stark\nwarriors, and went away with them toward the tents, which stood along\nthe side of the Shivering Flood where it was at its quietest; for\nthere was the grass the softest and most abundant.  There on the\ngreen grass were tables arrayed, and lamps were hung above them on\nspears, to be litten when the daylight should fail.  And the best of\nthe victual which the Vale could give was spread on the boards, along\nwith wine and dainties, bought in Silver-dale, or on the edges of the\nWestland with sword-strokes and arrow-flight.\n\nThere then they feasted and were merry; and the Sun-beam and Bow-may\nand the other women of the Vale served them at table, and were very\nblithe with them, caressing them with soft words, and with clipping\nand kissing, as folk who were grown exceeding dear to them; so that\nthat eve of battle was softer and sweeter to them than any hour of\ntheir life.  With these feasters were God-swain and Spear-fist of the\ndelivered thralls of Silver-dale as glad as glad might be; but Wolf-\nstone their eldest was gone with Dallach to the Council in the Hall.\n\nThe men of Burgdale and the Shepherds feasted otherwhere in all\ncontent, nor lacked folk of the Vale to serve them.  Amongst the men\nof the Face were the ten delivered thralls who had heart to meet\ntheir masters in arms:  seven of them were of Rose-dale and three of\nSilver-dale.\n\nThe Bride was with her kindred of the Steer, with whom were many men\nof Shadowy Vale, and she served her friends and fellows clad in her\nwar-gear, save helm and hauberk, bearing herself as one who is\nserving dear guests.  And men equalled her for her beauty to the Gods\nof the High Place and the Choosers of the Slain; and they who had not\nbeheld her before marvelled at her, and her loveliness held all men's\nhearts in a net of desire, so that they forebore their meat to gaze\nupon her; and if perchance her hand touched some young man, or her\ncheek or sweet-breathed mouth came nigh to his face, he became\nbewildered and wist not where he was, nor what to do.  Yet was she as\nlowly and simple of speech and demeanour as if she were a gooseherd\nof fourteen winters.\n\nIn the Hall was a goodly company, and all the leaders of the Folk\nwere therein, and Folk-might and the War-leader sitting in the midst\nof those stone seats on the days.  There then they agreed on the\nwhole ordering of the battle and the wending of the host, as shall be\ntold later on; and this matter was long a-doing, and when it was\ndone, men went to their places to sleep, for the night was well worn.\n\nBut when men had departed and all was still, Folk-might, light-clad\nand without a weapon, left the Hall and walked briskly toward the\nnether end of the Vale.  He passed by all the tents, the last whereof\nwere of the House of the Steer, and came to a place where was a great\nrock rising straight up from the plain like sheaves of black staves\nstanding close together; and it was called Staff-stone, and tales of\nthe elves had been told concerning it, so that Stone-face had beheld\nit gladly the day before.\n\nThe moon was just shining into Shadowy Vale, and the grass was bright\nwheresoever the shadows of the high cliffs were not, and the face of\nStaff-stone shone bright grey as Folk-might came within sight of it,\nand he beheld someone sitting at the base of the rock, and as he drew\nnigher he saw that it was a woman, and knew her for the Bride; for he\nhad prayed her to abide him there that night, because it was nigh to\nthe tents of the House of the Steer; and his heart was glad as he\ndrew nigh to her.\n\nShe sat quietly on a fragment of the black rock, clad as she had been\nall day, in her glittering kirtle, but without hauberk or helm, a\nwreath of wind-flowers about her head, her feet crossed over each\nother, her hands laid palm uppermost in her lap.  She moved not as he\ndrew nigh, but said in a gentle voice when he was close to her:\n\n'Chief of the Wolf, great warrior, thou wouldest speak with me; and\ngood it is that friends should talk together on the eve of battle,\nwhen they may never meet alive again.'\n\nHe said:  'My talk shall not be long; for thou and I both must sleep\nto-night, since there is work to hand to-morrow.  Now since, as thou\nsayest, O fairest of women, we may never meet again alive, I ask thee\nnow at this hour, when we both live and are near to one another, to\nsuffer me to speak to thee of my love of thee and desire for thee.\nSurely thou, who art the sweetest of all things the Gods and the\nkindreds have made, wilt not gainsay me this?'\n\nShe said very sweetly, yet smiling:  'Brother of my father's sons,\nhow can I gainsay thee thy speech?  Nay, hast thou not said it?  What\nmore canst thou add to it that will have fresh meaning to mine ears?'\n\nHe said:  'Thou sayest sooth:  might I then but kiss thine hand?'\n\nShe said, no longer smiling:  'Yea surely, even so may all men do who\ncan be called my friends--and thou art much my friend.'\n\nHe took her hand and kissed it, and held it thereafter; nor did she\ndraw it away.  The moon shone brightly on them; but by its light he\ncould not see if she reddened, but he deemed that her face was\ntroubled.  Then he said:  'It were better for me if I might kiss thy\nface, and take thee in mine arms.'\n\nThen said she:  'This only shall a man do with me when I long to do\nthe like with him.  And since thou art so much my friend, I will tell\nthee that as for this longing, I have it not.  Bethink thee what a\nlittle while it is since the lack of another man's love grieved me\nsorely.'\n\n'The time is short,' said Folk-might, 'if we tell up the hours\nthereof; but in that short space have a many things betid.'\n\nShe said:  'Dost thou know, canst thou guess, how sorely ashamed I\nwent amongst my people?  I durst look no man in the face for the\naching of mine heart, which methought all might see through my face.'\n\n'I knew it well,' he said; 'yet of me wert thou not ashamed but a\nlittle while ago, when thou didst tell me of thy grief.'\n\nShe said:  'True it is; and thou wert kind to me.  Thou didst become\na dear friend to me, methought.'\n\n'And wilt thou hurt a dear friend?' said he.\n\n'O no,' she said, 'if I might do otherwise.  Yet how if I might not\nchoose?  Shall there be no forgiveness for me then?'\n\nHe answered nothing; and still he held her hand that strove not to be\ngone from his, and she cast down her eyes.  Then he spake in a while:\n\n'My friend, I have been thinking of thee and of me; and now hearken:\nif thou wilt declare that thou feelest no sweetness embracing thine\nheart when I say that I desire thee sorely, as now I say it; or when\nI kiss thine hand, as now I kiss it; or when I pray thee to suffer me\nto cast mine arms about thee and kiss thy face, as now I pray it:  if\nthou wilt say this, then will I take thee by the hand straightway,\nand lead thee to the tents of the House of the Steer, and say\nfarewell to thee till the battle is over.  Canst thou say this out of\nthe truth of thine heart?'\n\nShe said:  'What then if I cannot say this word?  What then?'\n\nBut he answered nothing; and she sat still a little while, and then\narose and stood before him, looking him in the eyes, and said:\n\n'I cannot say it.'\n\nThen he caught her in his arms and strained her to him, and then\nkissed her lips and her face again and again, and she strove not with\nhim.  But at last she said:\n\n'Yet after all this shalt thou lead me back to my folk straight-way;\nand when the battle is done, if both we are living, then shall we\nspeak more thereof.'\n\nSo he took her hand and led her on toward the tents of the Steer, and\nfor a while he spake nought; for he doubted himself, what he should\nsay; but at last he spake:\n\n'Now is this better for me than if it had not been, whether I live or\nwhether I die.  Yet thou hast not said that thou lovest me and\ndesirest me.'\n\n'Wilt thou compel me?' she said.  'To-night I may not say it.  Who\nshall say what words my lips shall fashion when we stand together\nvictorious in Silver-dale; then indeed may the time seem long from\nnow.'\n\nHe said:  'Yea, true is that; yet once again I say that so measured\nlong and long is the time since first I saw thee in Burgdale before\nthou knewest me.  Yet now I will not bicker with thee, for be sure\nthat I am glad at heart.  And lo you! our feet have brought us to the\ntents of thy people.  All good go with thee!'\n\n'And with thee, sweet friend,' she said.  Then she lingered a little,\nturning her head toward the tents, and then turned her face toward\nhim and laid her hand on his neck, and drew his head adown to her and\nkissed his cheek, and therewith swiftly and lightly departed from\nhim.\n\nNow the night wore and the morning came; and Face-of-god was abroad\nvery early in the morning, as his custom was; and he washed the night\nfrom off him in the Carles' Bath of the Shivering Flood, and then\nwent round through the encampment of the host, and saw none stirring\nsave here and there the last watchmen of the night.  He spake with\none or two of these, and then went up to the head of the Vale, where\nwas the pass that led to Silver-dale; and there he saw the watch, and\nspake with them, and they told him that none had as yet come forth\nfrom the pass, and he bade them to blow the horn of warning to rouse\nup the Host as soon as the messengers came thence.  For forerunners\nhad been sent up the pass, and had been set to hold watch at divers\nplaces therein to pass on the word from place to place.\n\nThence went Face-of-god back toward the Hall; but when he was yet\nsome way from it, he saw a slender glittering warrior come forth from\nthe door thereof, who stood for a moment looking round about, and\nthen came lightly and swiftly toward him; and lo! it was the Sun-\nbeam, with a long hauberk over her kirtle falling below her knees, a\nhelm on her head and plated shoes on her feet.  She came up to him,\nand laid her hand to his cheek and the golden locks of his head (for\nhe was bare-headed), and said to him, smiling:\n\n'Gold-mane! thou badest me bear arms, and Folk-might also constrained\nme thereto.  Lo thou!'\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'Folk-might is wise then, even as I am; and\nforsooth as thou art.  For bethink thee if the bow drawn at a venture\nshould speed the eyeless shaft against thy breast, and send me forth\na wanderer from my Folk!  For how could I bear the sight of the fair\nDale, and no hope to see thee again therein?'\n\nShe said:  'The heart is light within me to-day.  Deemest thou that\nthis is strange?  Or dost thou call to mind that which thou spakest\nthe other day, that it was of no avail to stand in the Doom-ring of\nthe Folk and bear witness against ourselves?  This will I not.  This\nis no light-mindedness that thou beholdest in me, but the valiancy\nthat the Fathers have set in mine heart.  Deem not, O Gold-mane, fear\nnot, that we shall die before they dight the bride-bed for us.'\n\nHe would have kissed her mouth, but she put him away with her hand,\nand doffed her helm and laid it on the grass, and said:\n\n'This is not the last time that thou shalt kiss me, Gold-mane, my\ndear; and yet I long for it as if it were, so high as the Fathers\nhave raised me up this morn above fear and sadness.'\n\nHe said nought, but drew her to him, and wonder so moved him, that he\nlooked long and closely at her face before he kissed her; and\nforsooth he could find no blemish in it:  it was as if it were but\nnew come from the smithy of the Gods, and exceeding longing took hold\nof him.  But even as their lips met, from the head of the Vale came\nthe voice of the great horn; and it was answered straightway by the\nwatchers all down the tents; and presently arose the shouts of men\nand the clash of weapons as folk armed themselves, and laughter\ntherewith, for most men were battle-merry, and the cries of women\nshrilly-clear as they hastened about, busy over the morning meal\nbefore the departure of the Host.  But Face-of-god said softly, still\ncaressing the Sun-beam, and she him:\n\n'Thus then we depart from this Valley of the Shadows, but as thou\nsaidst when first we met therein, there shall be no sundering of thee\nand me, but thou shalt go down with me to the battle.'\n\nAnd he led her by the hand into the Hall of the Wolf, and there they\nate a morsel, and thereafter Face-of-god tarried not, but busied\nhimself along with Folk-might and the other chieftains in arraying\nthe Host for departure.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.  THE HOST DEPARTETH FROM SHADOWY VALE:  THE FIRST DAY'S\nJOURNEY\n\n\n\nIt was about three hours before noon that the Host began to enter\ninto the pass out of Shadowy Vale by the river-side; and the women\nand children, and men unfightworthy, stood on the higher ground at\nthe foot of the cliffs to see the Host wend on the way.  Of these a\nmany were of the Woodlanders, who were now one folk with them of\nShadowy Vale.  And all these had chosen to abide tidings in the Vale,\ndeeming that there was little danger therein, since that last\nslaughter which Folk-might had made of the Dusky Men; albeit Face-of-\ngod had offered to send them all to Burgstead with two score and ten\nmen-at-arms to guard them by the way and to eke out the warders of\nthe Burg.\n\nNow the fighting-men of Shadowy Vale were two long hundreds lacking\nfive; of whom two score and ten were women, and three score and ten\nlads under twenty winters; but the women, though you might scarce see\nfairer of face and body, were doughty in arms, all good shooters in\nthe bow; and the swains were eager and light-foot, cragsmen of the\nbest, wont to scaling the cliffs of the Vale in search of the nests\nof gerfalcons and such-like fowl, and swimming the strong streams of\nthe Shivering Flood; tough bodies and wiry, stronger than most grown\nmen, and as fearless as the best.\n\nThe order of the Departure of the Host was this:\n\nThe Woodlanders went first into the pass, and with them were two\nscore of the ripe Warriors of the Wolf.  Then came of the kindreds of\nBurgdale, the Men of the Steer, the Bridge, and the Bull; then the\nMen of the Vine and the Sickle; then the Shepherd-folk; and lastly,\nthe Men of the Face led by Stone-face and Hall-face.  With these went\nanother two score of the dwellers in Shadowy Vale, and the rest were\nscattered up and down the bands of the Host to guide them into the\nbest paths and to make the way easier to them.  Face-of-god was\nsundered from his kindred, and went along with Folk-might in the\nforefront of the Host, while his father the Alderman went as a simple\nman-at-arms with his House in the rearward.  The Sun-beam followed\nher brother and Face-of-god amidst the Warriors of the Wolf, and with\nher were Bow-may clad in the Alderman's gift, and Wood-father and his\nchildren.  Bow-may had caused her to doff her hauberk for that day,\nwhereon they looked to fall in with no foeman.  As for the Bride, she\nwent with her kindred in all her war-gear; and the morning sun shone\nin the gems of her apparel, and her jewelled feet fell like flowers\nupon the deep grass of the upper Vale, and shone strange and bright\namongst the black stones of the pass.  She bore a quiver at her back\nand a shining yew bow in her hand, and went amongst the bowmen, for\nshe was a very deft archer.\n\nSo fared they into the pass, leaving peace behind them, with all\ntheir banners displayed, and the banner of the Red-mouthed Wolf went\nwith the Wolf and the Sun-burst in the forefront of their battle next\nafter the two captains.\n\nAs for their road, the grassy space between the rock-wall and the\nwater was wide and smooth at first, and the cliffs rose up like\nbundles of spear-shafts high and clear from the green grass with no\nconfused litter of fallen stones; so that the men strode on briskly,\ntheir hearts high-raised and full of hope.  And as they went, the\nsweetness of song stirred in their souls, and at last Bow-may fell to\nsinging in a loud clear voice, and her cousin Wood-wise answered her,\nand all the warriors of the Wolf who were in their band fell into the\nsong at the ending, and the sound of their melody went down the water\nand reached the ears of those that were entering the pass, and of\nthose who were abiding till the way should be clear of them:  and\nthis is some of what they sang:\n\n\nBow-may singeth:\n\nHear ye never a voice come crying\n   Out from the waste where the winds fare wide?\n'Sons of the Wolf, the days are dying,\n   And where in the clefts of the rocks do ye hide?\n\n'Into your hands hath the Sword been given,\n   Hard are the palms with the kiss of the hilt;\nThrough the trackless waste hath the road been riven\n   For the blade to seek to the heart of the guilt.\n\n'And yet ye bide and yet ye tarry;\n   Dear deem ye the sleep 'twixt hearth and board,\nAnd sweet the maiden mouths ye marry,\n   And bright the blade of the bloodless sword.'\n\nWood-wise singeth:\n\nYea, here we dwell in the arms of our Mother\n   The Shadowy Queen, and the hope of the Waste;\nHere first we came, when never another\n   Adown the rocky stair made haste.\n\nFar is the foe, and no sword beholdeth\n   What deed we work and whither we wend;\nDear are the days, and the Year enfoldeth\n   The love of our life from end to end.\n\nVoice of our Fathers, why will ye move us,\n   And call up the sun our swords to behold?\nWhy will ye cry on the foeman to prove us?\n   Why will ye stir up the heart of the bold?\n\nBow-may singeth:\n\nPurblind am I, the voice of the chiding;\n   Then tell me what is the thing ye bear?\nWhat is the gift that your hands are hiding,\n   The gold-adorned, the dread and dear?\n\nWood-wise singeth:\n\nDark in the sheath lies the Anvil's Brother,\n   Hid is the hammered Death of Men.\nWould ye look on the gift of the green-clad Mother?\n   How then shall ye ask for a gift again?\n\nThe Warriors sing:\n\nShow we the Sunlight the Gift of the Mother,\n   As foot follows foot to the foeman's den!\nGleam Sun, breathe Wind, on the Anvil's Brother,\n   For bare is the hammered Death of Men.\n\n\nTherewith they shook their naked swords in the air, and fared on\neagerly, and as swiftly as the pass would have them fare.  But so it\nwas, that when the rearward of the Host was entering the first of the\npass, and was going on the wide smooth sward, the vanward was gotten\nto where there was but a narrow space clear betwixt water and cliff;\nfor otherwhere was a litter of great rocks and small, hard to be\nthreaded even by those who knew the passes well; so that men had to\ntread along the very verge of the Shivering Flood, and wary must they\nbe, for the water ran swift and deep betwixt banks of sheer rock half\na fathom below their very foot-soles, which had but bare space to go\non the narrow a way.  So it held on for a while, and then got safer,\nand there was more space for going betwixt cliff and flood; albeit it\nwas toilsome enough, since for some way yet there was a drift of\nstones to cumber their feet, some big and some little, and some very\nbig.  After a while the way grew better, though here and there, where\nthe cliffs lowered, were wide screes of loose stones that they must\nneeds climb up and down.  Thereafter for a space was there an end of\nthe stony cumber, but the way betwixt the river and the cliffs\nnarrowed again, and the black crags grew higher, and at last so\nexceeding high, and the way so narrow, that the sky overhead was to\nthem as though they were at the bottom of a well, and men deemed that\nthence they could see the stars at noontide.  For some time withal\nhad the way been mounting up and up, though the cliffs grew higher\nover it; till at last they were but going on a narrow shelf, the\nShivering Flood swirling and rattling far below them betwixt sheer\nrock-walls grown exceeding high; and above them the cliffs going up\ntowards the heavens as black as a moonless starless night of winter.\nAnd as the flood thundered below, so above them roared the ceaseless\nthunder of the wind of the pass, that blew exceeding fierce down that\nstrait place; so that the skirts of their garments were wrapped about\ntheir knees by it, and their feet were well-nigh stayed at whiles as\nthey breasted the push thereof.\n\nBut as they mounted higher and higher yet, the noise of the waters\nswelled into a huge roar that drowned the bellowing of the prisoned\nwind, and down the pass came drifting a fine rain that fell not from\nthe sky, for between the clouds of that drift could folk see the\nheavens bright and blue above them.  This rain was but the spray of\nthe great force up to whose steps they were climbing.\n\nNow the way got rougher as they mounted; but this toil was caused by\ntheir gain; for the rock-wall, which thrust out a buttress there as\nif it would have gone to the very edge of the gap where-through the\nflood ran, and so have cut the way off utterly, was here somewhat\nbroken down, and its stones scattered down the steep bent, so that\nthere was a passage, though a toilsome one.\n\nThus then through the wind-borne drift of the great force, through\nwhich men could see the white waters tossing down below, amidst the\nclattering thunder of the Shivering Flood and the rumble of the wind\nof the gap, that tore through their garments and hair as if it would\nrend all to rags and bear it away, the banners of the Wolf won their\nway to the crest of the midmost height of the pass, and the long line\nof the Host came clambering after them; and each band of warriors as\nit reached the top cast an unheard shout from amidst the tangled fury\nof wind and waters.\n\nA little further on and all that turmoil was behind them; the sun,\nnow grown low, smote the wavering column of spray from the force at\ntheir backs, till the rainbows lay bright across it; and the sunshine\nlay wide over a little valley that sloped somewhat steeply to the\nwest right up from the edge of the river; and beyond these western\nslopes could men see a low peak spreading down on all sides to the\nplain, till it was like to a bossed shield, and the name of it was\nShield-broad.  Dark grey was the valley everywhere, save that by the\nside of the water was a space of bright green-sward hedged about\ntoward the mountain by a wall of rocks tossed up into wild shapes of\nspires and jagged points.  The river itself was spread out wide and\nshallow, and went rattling about great grey rocks scattered here and\nthere amidst it, till it gathered itself together to tumble headlong\nover three slant steps into the mighty gap below.\n\nFrom the height in the pass those grey slopes seemed easy to\ntraverse; but the warriors of the Wolf knew that it was far\notherwise, for they were but the molten rock-sea that in time long\npast had flowed forth from Shield-broad and filled up the whole\nvalley endlong and overthwart, cooling as it flowed, and the tumbled\nhedge of rock round about the green plain by the river was where the\nsaid rock-sea had been stayed by meeting with soft ground, and had\nheaped itself up round about the green-sward.  And that great rock-\nflood as it cooled split in divers fashions; and the rain and weather\nhad been busy on it for ages, so that it was worn into a maze of\nnarrow paths, most of which, after a little, brought the wayfarer to\na dead stop, or else led him back again to the place whence he had\nstarted; so that only those who knew the passes throughly could\nthread that maze without immeasurable labour.\n\nNow when the men of the Host looked from the high place whereon they\nstood toward the green plain by the river, they saw on the top of\nthat rock-wall a red pennon waving on a spear, and beside it three or\nfour weaponed men gleaming bright in the evening sun; and they waved\ntheir swords to the Host, and made lightning of the sunbeams, and the\nmen of the Host waved swords to them in turn.  For these were the\noutguards of the Host; and the place whereon they were was at whiles\ndwelt in by those who would drive the spoil in Silver-dale, and\nmidmost of the green-sward was a booth builded of rough stones and\nturf, a refuge for a score of men in rough weather.\n\nSo the men of the vanward gat them down the hill, and made the best\nof their way toward the grassy plain through that rocky maze which\nhad once been as a lake of molten glass; and as short as the way\nlooked from above, it was two hours or ever they came out of it on to\nthe smooth turf, and it was moonlight and night ere the House of the\nFace had gotten on to the green-sward.\n\nThere then the Host abode for that night, and after they had eaten\nlay down on the green grass and slept as they might.  Bow-may would\nhave brought the Sun-beam into the booth with some others of the\nwomen, but she would not enter it, because she deemed that otherwise\nthe Bride would abide without; and the Bride, when she came up, along\nwith the House of the Steer, beheld the Sun-beam, that Wood-father's\nchildren had made a lair for her without like a hare's form; and\nforsooth many a time had she lain under the naked heaven in Shadowy\nVale and the waste about it, even as the Bride had in the meadows of\nBurgdale.  So when the Bride was bidden thereto, she went meekly into\nthe booth, and lay there with others of the damsels-at-arms.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII.  THE HOST COMETH TO THE EDGES OF SILVER-DALE\n\n\n\nSo wore the night, and when the dawn was come were the two captains\nafoot, and they went from band to band to see that all was ready, and\nall men were astir betimes, and by the time that the sun smote the\neastern side of Shield-broad ruddy, they had broken their fast and\nwere dight for departure.  Then the horns blew up beside the banners,\nand rejoiced the hearts of men.  But by the command of the captains\nthis was the last time that they should sound till they blew for\nonset in Silver-dale, because now would they be drawing nigher and\nnigher to the foemen, and they wotted not but that wandering bands of\nthem might be hard on the lips of the pass, and might hear the horns'\nvoice, and turn to see what was toward.\n\nForth then went the banners of the Wolf, and the men of the vanward\nfell to threading the rock-maze toward the north, and in two hours'\ntime were clear of the Dale under Shield-broad.  All went in the same\norder as yesterday; but on this day the Sun-beam would bear her\nhauberk, and had a sword girt to her side, and her heart was high and\nher speech merry.\n\nWhen they left the Dale under Shield-broad the way was easy and wide\nfor a good way, the river flowing betwixt low banks, and the pass\nbeing more like a string of little valleys than a mere gap, as it had\nbeen on the other side of the Dale.  But when one third of the day\nwas past, the way began to narrow on them again, and to rise up\nlittle by little; and at last the rock-walls drew close to the river,\nand when men looked toward the north they saw no way, and nought but\na wall.  For the gap of the Shivering Flood turned now to the east,\nand the Flood came down from the east in many falls, as it were over\na fearful stair, through a gap where there was no path between the\ncliffs and the water, nought but the boiling flood and its turmoil;\nso that they who knew not the road wondered what they should do.\n\nBut Folk-might led the banners to where a great buttress of the\ncliffs thrust itself into the way, coming well-nigh down to the\nwater, just at the corner where the river turned eastward, and they\ngot them about it as they might, and on the other side thereof lo!\nanother gap exceeding strait, scarce twenty foot over, wall-sided,\nrugged beyond measure, going up steeply from the great valley:  a\nlittle water ran through it, mostly filling up the floor of it from\nside to side; but it was but shallow.  This was now the battle-road\nof the Host, and the vanward entered it at once, turning their backs\nupon the Shivering Flood.\n\nFull toilsome and dreary was that strait way; often great stones hung\nabove their heads, bridging the gap and hiding the sky from them; nor\nwas there any path for them save the stream itself; so that whiles\nwere they wading its waters to the knee or higher, and whiles were\nthey striding from stone to stone amidst the rattle of the waters,\nand whiles were they stepping warily along the ledges of rock above\nthe deeper pools, and in all wise labouring in overcoming the rugged\nroad amidst the twilight of the gap.\n\nThus they toiled till the afternoon was well worn, and so at last\nthey came to where the rock-wall was somewhat broken down on the\nnorth side, and great rocks had fallen across the gap, and dammed up\nthe waters, which fell scantily over the dam from stone to stone into\na pool at the bottom of it.  Up this breach, then, below the force\nthey scrambled and struggled, for rough indeed was the road for them;\nand so came they up out of the gap on to the open hill-side, a great\nshoulder of the heath sloping down from the north, and littered over\nwith big stones, borne thither belike by some ice-river of the\nearlier days; and one great rock was in special as great as the hall\nof a wealthy goodman, and shapen like to a hall with hipped gables,\nwhich same the men of the Wolf called House-stone.\n\nThere then the noise and clatter of the vanward rose up on the face\nof the heath, and men were exceeding joyous that they had come so far\nwithout mishap.  Therewith came weaponed men out from under House-\nstone, and they came toward the men of the vanward, and they were a\nhalf-score of the forerunners of the Wolf; therefore Folk-might and\nFace-of-god fell at once into speech with them, and had their\ntidings; and when they had heard them, they saw nought to hinder the\nhost from going on their road to Silver-dale forthright; and there\nwere still three hours of daylight before them.  So the vanward of\nthe host tarried not, and the captains left word with the men from\nunder House-stone that the rest of the Host should fare on after them\nspeedily, and that they should give this word to each company, as men\ncame up from out the gap.  Then they fared speedily up the hillside,\nand in an hour's wearing had come to the crest thereof, and to where\nthe ground fell steadily toward the north, and hereabout the\nscattered stones ceased, and on the other side of the crest the heath\nbegan to be soft and boggy, and at last so soft, that if they had not\nbeen wisely led, they had been bemired oftentimes.  At last they came\nto where the flows that trickled through the mires drew together into\na stream, so that men could see it running; and thereon some of the\nWoodlanders cried out joyously that the waters were running north;\nand then all knew that they were drawing nigh to Silver-dale.\n\nNo man they met on the road, nor did they of Shadowy Vale look to\nmeet any; because the Dusky Men were not great hunters for the more\npart, except it were of men, and especially of women; and, moreover,\nthese hill-slopes of the mountain-necks led no-whither and were\nutterly waste and dreary, and there was nought to be seen there but\nsnipes and bitterns and whimbrel and plover, and here and there a\nhill-fox, or the great erne hanging over the heath on his way to the\nmountain.\n\nWhen sunset came, they were getting clear of the miry ground, and the\nstream which they had come across amidst of the mires had got clearer\nand greater, and rattled down between wide stony sides over the\nheath; and here and there it deepened as it cleft its way through\nlittle knolls that rose out of the face of the mountain-neck.  As the\nHost climbed one of these and was come to its topmost (it was low\nenough not to turn the stream), Face-of-god looked and beheld dark-\nblue mountains rising up far off before him, and higher than these,\nbut away to the east, the snowy peaks of the World-mountains.  Then\nhe called to mind what he had seen from the Burg of the Runaways, and\nhe took Folk-might by the arm, and pointed toward those far-off\nmountains.\n\n'Yea,' said Folk-might, 'so it is, War-leader.  Silver-dale lieth\nbetween us and yonder blue ridges, and it is far nigher to us than to\nthem.'\n\nBut the Sun-beam came close to those twain, and took Face-of-god by\nthe hand and said:  'O Gold-mane, dost thou see?' and he turned about\nand beheld her, and saw how her cheeks flamed and her eyes glittered,\nand he said in a low voice:  'To-morrow for mirth or silence, for\nlife or death.'\n\nBut the whole vanward as they came up stayed to behold the sight of\nthe mountains on the other side of Silver-dale, and the banners of\nthe Folk hung over their heads, moving but little in the soft air of\nthe evening:  so went they on their ways.\n\nThe sun sank, and dusk came on them as they followed down the stream,\nand night came, and was clear and starlit, though the moon was not\nyet risen.  Now was the ground firm and the grass sweet and flowery,\nand wind-worn bushes were scattered round about them, as they began\nto go down into the ghyll that cleft the wall of Silver-dale, and the\nnight-wind blew in their faces from the very Dale and place of the\nBattle to be.  The path down was steep at first, but the ghyll was\nwide, and the sides of it no longer straight walls, as in the gaps of\ntheir earlier journey, but broken, sloping back, and (as they might\nsee on the morrow) partly of big stones and shaly grit, partly grown\nover with bushes and rough grass, with here and there a little stream\ntrickling down their sides.  As they went, the ghyll widened out,\ntill at last they were in a valley going down to the plain, in places\nsteep, in places flat and smooth, the stream ever rattling down the\nmidst of it, and they on the west side thereof.  The vale was well\ngrassed, and oak-trees and ash and holly and hazel grew here and\nthere about it; and at last the Host had before it a wood which\nfilled the vale from side to side, not much tangled with undergrowth,\nand quite clear of it nigh to the stream-side.  Thereinto the vanward\nentered, but went no long way ere the leaders called a halt and bade\npitch the banners, for that there should they abide the daylight.\nThus it had been determined at the Council of the Hall of the Wolf;\nfor Folk-might had said:  'With an Host as great as ours, and mostly\nof men come into a land of which they know nought at all, an\nonslaught by night is perilous:  yea, and our foes should be over-\nmuch scattered, and we should have to wander about seeking them.  Let\nus rather abide in the wood of Wood-dale till the morning, and then\ndisplay our banners on the hill-side above Silver-dale, so that they\nmay gather together to fall upon us:  in no case shall they keep us\nout of the Dale.'\n\nThere then they stayed, and as each company came up to the wood, they\nwere marshalled into their due places, so that they might set the\nbattle in array on the edge of Silver-dale,\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.  FACE-OF-GOD LOOKETH ON SILVER-DALE:  THE BOWMEN'S\nBATTLE\n\n\n\nThere then they rested, as folk wearied with the toilsome journey,\nwhen they had set sure watches round about their campment; and they\nate quietly what meat they had with them, and so gat them to sleep in\nthe wood on the eve of battle.\n\nBut not all slept; for the two captains went about amongst the\ncompanies, Folk-might to the east, Face-of-god to the west, to look\nto the watches, and to see that all was ordered duly.  Also the Sun-\nbeam slept not, but she lay beside Bow-may at the foot of an oak-\ntree; she watched Face-of-god as he went away amidst the men of the\nHost, and watched and waked abiding his returning footsteps.\n\nThe night was well worn by then he came back to his place in the\nvanward, and on his way back he passed through the folk of the Steer\nlaid along on the grass, all save those of the watch, and the light\nof the moon high aloft was mingled with the light of the earliest\ndawn; and as it happed he looked down, and lo! close to his feet the\nface of the Bride as she lay beside her grand-sire, her head pillowed\non a bundle of bracken.  She was sleeping soundly like a child who\nhas been playing all day, and whose sleep has come to him unsought\nand happily.  Her hands were laid together by her side; her cheek was\nas fair and clear as it was wont to be at her best; her face looked\ncalm and happy, and a lock of her dark-red hair strayed from her\nuncovered head over her breast and lay across her wrists, so\npeacefully she slept.\n\nFace-of-god turned his eyes from her at once, and went by swiftly,\nand came to his own company.  The Sun-beam saw him coming, and rose\nstraightway to her feet from beside Bow-may, who lay fast asleep, and\nshe held out her hands to him; and he took them and kissed them, and\nhe cast his arms about her and kissed her mouth and her face, and she\nhis in likewise; and she said:\n\n'O Gold-mane, if this were but the morrow of to-morrow!  Yet shall\nall be well; shall it not?'\n\nHer voice was low, but it waked Bow-may, who sat up at once broad\nawake, after the manner of a hunter of the waste ever ready for the\nnext thing to betide, and moreover the Sun-beam had been in her\nthoughts these two days, and she feared for her, lest she should be\nslain or maimed.  Now she smiled on the Sun-beam and said:\n\n'What is it?  Does thy mind forebode evil?  That needeth not.  I tell\nthee it is not so ill for us of the sword to be in Silver-dale.\nThrice have I been there since the Overthrow, and never more than a\nhalf-score in company, and yet am I whole to-day.'\n\n'Yea, sister,' said Face-of-god, 'but in past times ye did your deed\nand then fled away; but now we come to abide here, and this night is\nthe last of lurking.'\n\n'Ah,' she said, 'a little way from this I saw such things that we had\ngood will to abide here longer, few as we were, but that we feared to\nbe taken alive.'\n\n'What things were these?' said Face-of-god.\n\n'Nay,' she said, 'I will not tell thee now; but mayhap in the lighted\nwinter feast-hall, when the kindred are so nigh us and about us that\nthey seem to us as if they were all the world, I may tell it thee; or\nmayhap I never shall.'\n\nSaid the Sun-beam, smiling:  'Thou wilt ever be talking, Bow-may.\nNow let the War-leader depart, for he will have much to do.'\n\nAnd she was well at ease that she had seen Face-of-god again; but he\nsaid:\n\n'Nay, not so much; all is well-nigh done; in an hour it will be broad\nday, and two hours thereafter shall the Banner be displayed on the\nedge of Silver-dale.'\n\nThe cheek of the Sun-beam flushed, and paled again, as she said:\n'Yea, we shall stand even as our Fathers stood on the day when,\ncoming from off the waste, they beheld it, and knew it would be\ntheirs.  Ah me! how have I longed for this morn.  But now--Tell me,\nGold-mane, dost thou deem that I am afraid?  And I whom thou hast\ndeemed to be a God.'\n\nQuoth Bow-may:  'Thou shalt deem her twice a God ere noon-tide,\nbrother Gold-mane.  But come now! the hour of deadly battle is at\nhand, and we may not laugh that away; and therefore I bid thee\nremember, Gold-mane, how thou didst promise to kiss me once more on\nthe verge of deadly battle.'\n\nTherewith she stood up before him, and he tarried not, but kind and\nsmiling took her face between his two hands and kissed her lips, and\nshe cast her arms about him and kissed him, and then sank down on the\ngrass again, and turned from him, and laid her face amongst the grass\nand the bracken, and they could see that she was weeping, and her\nbody was shaken with sobs.  But the Sun-beam knelt down to her, and\ncaressed her with her hand, and spake kind words to her softly, while\nFace-of-god went his ways to meet Folk-might.\n\nNow was the dawn fading into full daylight; and between dawn and\nsunrise were all men stirring; for the watch had waked the hundred-\nleaders, and they the leaders of scores and half-scores, and they the\nwhole folk; and they sat quietly in the wood and made no noise.\n\nIn the night the watch of the Sickle had fallen in with a thrall who\nhad stolen up from the Dale to set gins for hares, and now in the\nearly morning they brought him to the War-leader.  He was even such a\nman as those with whom Face-of-god had fallen in before, neither\nbetter nor worse than most of them:  he was sore afraid at first, but\nby then he was come to the captains he understood that he had\nhappened upon friends; but he was dull of comprehension and slow of\nspeech.  Albeit Folk-might gathered from him that the Dusky Men had\nsome inkling of the onslaught; for he said that they had been\ngathering together in the marketplace of Silver-stead, and would do\nso again soon.  Moreover, the captains deemed from his speech that\nthose new tribes had come to hand sooner than was looked for, and\nwere even now in the Dale.  Folk-might smiled as one who is not best\npleased when he heard these tidings; but Face-of-god was glad to hear\nthereof; for what he loathed most was that the war should drag out in\nhunting of scattered bands of the foe.  Herewith came Dallach to them\nas they talked (for Face-of-god had sent for him), and he fell to\nquestioning the man further; by whose answers it seemed that many men\nalso had come into the Dale from Rose-dale, so that they of the\nkindreds were like to have their hands full.  Lastly Dallach drew\nfrom the thrall that it was on that very morning that the great Folk-\nmote of the Dusky Men should be holden in the market-place of the\nStead, which was right great, and about it were the biggest of the\nhouses wherein the men of the kindred had once dwelt.\n\nSo when they had made an end of questioning the thrall, and had given\nhim meat and drink, they asked him if he would take weapons in his\nhand and lead them on the ways into the Dale, bidding him look about\nthe wood and note how great and mighty an host they were.  And the\ncarle yeasaid this, after staring about him a while, and they gave\nhim spear and shield, and he went with the vanward as a way-leader.\n\nAgain presently came a watch of the Shepherds, and they had found a\nman and a woman dead and stark naked hanging to the boughs of a great\noak-tree deep in the wood.  This men knew for some vengeance of the\nDusky Men, for it was clear to see that these poor people had been\nsorely tormented before they were slain.  Also the same watch had\nstumbled on the dead body of an old woman, clad in rags, lying\namongst the rank grass about a little flow; she was exceeding lean\nand hunger-starved, and in her hand was a frog which she had half\neaten.  And Dallach, when he heard of this, said that it was the wont\nof the Dusky Men to slay their thralls when they were past work, or\nto drive them into the wilderness to die.\n\nLastly came a watch from the men of the Face, having with them two\nmore thralls, lusty young men; these they had come upon in company of\ntheir master, who had brought them up into the wood to shoot him a\nbuck, and therefore they bare bows and arrows.  The watch had slain\nthe master straightway while the thralls stood looking on.  They were\nmuch afraid of the weaponed men, but answered to the questioning much\nreadier than the first man; for they were household thralls, and\nbetter fed and clad than he, who was but a toiler in the fields.\nThey yeasaid all his tale, and said moreover that the Folk-mote of\nthe Dusky Men should be holden in the market-place that forenoon, and\nthat most of the warriors should be there, both the new-comers and\nthe Rose-dale lords, and that without doubt they should be under\narms.\n\nTo these men also they gave a good sword and a helm each, and bade\nthem be brisk with their bows, and they said yea to marching with the\nHost; and indeed they feared nothing so much as being left behind;\nfor if they fell into the hands of the Dusky Men, and their master\nmissing, they should first be questioned with torments, and then\nslain in the evillest manner.\n\nNow whereas things had thus betid, and that they knew thus much of\ntheir foemen, Face-of-god called all the chieftains together, and\nthey sat on the green grass and held counsel amongst them, and to one\nand all it seemed good that they should suffer the Dusky Men to\ngather together before they meddled with them, and then fall upon\nthem in such order and such time as should seem good to the captains\nwatching how things went; and this would be easy, whereas they were\nall lying in the wood in the same order as they would stand in\nbattle-array if they were all drawn up together on the brow of the\nhill.  Albeit Face-of-god deemed it good, after he had heard all that\nthey who had been in the Stead could tell him thereof, that the\nShepherd-Folk, who were more than three long hundreds, and they of\nthe Steer, the Bridge, and the Bull, four hundreds in all, should\ntake their places eastward of the Woodlanders who had led the\nvanward.\n\nStraightway the word was borne to these men, and the shift was made:\nso that presently the Woodlanders were amidmost of the Host, and had\nwith them on their right hands the Men of the Steer, the Bridge, and\nthe Bull, and beyond them the Shepherd-Folk.  But on their left hand\nlay the Men of the Vine, then they of the Sickle, and lastly the Men\nof the Face, and these three kindreds were over five hundreds of\nwarriors:  as for the Men of the Wolf, they abode at first with those\ncompanies which they had led through the wastes, though this was\nchanged afterwards.\n\nAll this being done, Face-of-god gave out that all men should break\ntheir fast in peace and leisure; and while men were at their meat,\nFolk-might spake to Face-of-god and said:  'Come, brother, for I\nwould show thee a goodly thing; and thou, Dallach, come with us.'\n\nThen he brought them by paths in the wood till Face-of-god saw the\nsky shine white between the tree-boles, and in a little while they\nwere come well-nigh out of the thicket, and then they went warily;\nfor before them was nought but the slopes of Wood-dale, going down\nsteeply into Silver-dale, with nought to hinder the sight of it, save\nhere and there bushes or scattered trees; and so fair and lovely it\nwas that Face-of-god could scarce forbear to cry out.  He saw that it\nwas only at the upper or eastern end, where the mountains of the\nWaste went round about it, that the Dale was narrow; it soon widened\nout toward the west, and for the most part was encompassed by no such\nstraight-sided a wall as was Burgdale, but by sloping hills and\nbents, mostly indeed somewhat higher and steeper than the pass\nwherein they were, but such as men could well climb if they had a\nmind to, and there were any end to their journey.  The Dale went due\nwest a good way, and then winded about to the southwest, and so was\nhidden from them thereaway by the bents that lay on their left hand.\nAs it was wider, so it was not so plain a ground as was Burgdale, but\nrose in knolls and little hills here and there.  A river greater than\nthe Weltering Water wound about amongst the said mounds; and along\nthe side of it out in the open dale were many goodly houses and\nhomesteads of stone.  The knolls were mostly covered over with vines,\nand there were goodly and great trees in groves and clumps, chiefly\noak and sweet chestnut and linden; many were the orchards, now in\nblossom, about the homesteads; the pastures of the neat and horses\nspread out bright green up from the water-side, and deeper green\nshowed the acres of the wheat on the lower slopes of the knolls, and\nin wide fields away from the river.\n\nJust below the pitch of the hill whereon they were, lay Silver-stead,\nthe town of the Dale.  Hitherto it had been an unfenced place; but\nFolk-might pointed to where on the western side a new white wall was\nrising, and on which, young as the day yet was, men were busy laying\nthe stones and spreading the mortar.  Fair seemed that town to Face-\nof-god:  the houses were all builded of stone, and some of the\nbiggest were roofed with lead, which also as well as silver was dug\nout of the mountains at the eastern end of the Dale.  The market-\nplace was clear to see from where they stood, though there were\nhouses on all sides of it, so wide it was.  From their standing-place\nit was but three furlongs to this heart of Silver-dale; and Face-of-\ngod could see brightly-clad men moving about in it already.  High\nabove their heads he beheld two great clots of scarlet and yellow\nraised on poles and pitched in front of a great stone-built hall\nroofed with lead, which stood amidmost of the west end of the Place,\nand betwixt those poles he saw on a mound with long slopes at its\nsides somewhat of white stone, and amidmost of the whole Place a\ngreat stack of faggot-wood built up four-square.  Those red and\nyellow things on the poles he deemed would be the banners of the\nmurder-carles; and Folk-might told him that even so it was, and that\nthey were but big bunches of strips of woollen cloth, much like to\ngreat ragmops, save that the rags were larger and longer:  no other\ntoken of war, said Folk-might, did those folk carry, save a\ncrookbladed sword, smeared with man's blood, and bigger than any man\nmight wield in battle.\n\n'Art thou far-seeing, War-leader?' quoth he.  'What canst thou see in\nthe market-place?'\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'Far-seeing am I above most men, and I see in the\nPlace a man in scarlet standing by the banner, which is pitched in\nfront of the great stone hall, near to the mound with the white stone\non it; and meseemeth he beareth a great horn in his hand.'\n\nSaid Folk-might:  'Yea, and that stone hall was our Mote-house when\nwe were lords of the Dale, and thence it was that they who are now\nthralls of the Dusky Men sent to them their message and token of\nyielding.  And as for that white stone, it is the altar of their god;\nfor they have but one, and he is that same crook-bladed sword.  And\nnow that I look, I see a great stack of wood amidmost the market-\nplace, and well I know what that betokeneth.'\n\n'Lo you!' said Face-of-god, 'the man with the horn is gone up on to\nthe altar-mound, and meseemeth he is setting the little end of the\nhorn to his mouth.'\n\n'Hearken then!' said Folk-might.  And in a moment came the hoarse\ntuneless sound of the horn down the wind towards them; and Folk-might\nsaid:\n\n'I deem I should know what that blast meaneth; and now is it time\nthat the Host drew nigher to set them in array behind these very\ntrees.  But if ye will, War-leader, we will abide here and watch the\nways of the foemen, and send Dallach with the word to the Host; also\nI would have thee suffer me to bid hither at once two score and ten\nof the best of the bowmen of our folk and the Woodlanders, and Wood-\nwise to lead them, for he knoweth well the land hereabout, and what\nis good to do.'\n\n'It is good,' said Face-of-god.  'Be speedy, Dallach!'\n\nSo Dallach departed, running lightly, and the two chiefs abode there;\nand the horn in Silver-stead blew at whiles for a little, and then\nstayed; and Folk-might said:\n\n'Lo you! they come flockmeal to the Mote-stead; the Place will be\nfilled ere long.'\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'Will they make offerings to their god at the\nhallowing in of their Folk-mote?  Where then are the slaughter-\nbeasts?'\n\n'They shall not long be lacking,' said Folk-might.  'See you it is\ngetting thronged about the altar and the Mote-house.'\n\nNow there were four ways into the Market-place of Silver-stead turned\ntoward the four airts, and the midmost of the kindreds' battle looked\nright down the southern one, which went up to the wood, but stopped\nthere in a mere woodland path, and the more part of the town lay\nnorth and west of this way, albeit there was a way from the east\nalso.  But the hill-side just below the two captains lay two furlongs\nwest of this southern way; and it went down softly till it was gotten\nquite near to the backs of the houses on the south side of the\nMarket-place, and was sprinkled scantly with bushes and trees as\naforesaid; but at last were there more bushes, which well-nigh made a\nhedge across it, reaching from the side of the southern way; and a\nfoot or two beyond these bushes the ground fell by a steep and broken\nbent down to the level of the Market-place, and betwixt that fringe\nof bushes and the backs of the houses on the south side of the Place\nwas less it maybe than a full furlong:  but the southern road\naforesaid went down softly into the Market-place, since it had been\nfashioned so by men.\n\nNow the two chiefs heard a loud blast of horns come up from the town,\nand lo! a great crowd of men wending their ways down the road from\nthe north, and they came into the market-place with spears and other\nweapons tossing in the air, and amidst of these men, who seemed to be\nall of the warriors, they saw as they drew nigher some two score and\nten of men clad in long raiment of yellow and scarlet, with tall\nspiring hats of strange fashion on their heads, and in their hands\nlong staves with great blades like scythes done on to them; and\nagain, in the midst of these yellow and red glaive-bearers, in the\nvery heart of the throng were some score of naked folk, they deemed\nboth men and women, but were not sure, so close was the throng; nor\ncould they see if they were utterly naked.\n\n'Lo you, brother!' quoth Folk-might, 'said I not that the beasts for\nthe hewing should not tarry?  Yonder naked folk are even they:  and\nye may well deem that they are the thralls of the Dusky Men; and\nmeseemeth by the whiteness of their skins they be of the best of\nthem.  For these felons, it is like, look to winning great plenty of\nthralls in Burgdale, and so set the less store on them they have, and\nmay expend them freely.'\n\nAs he spake they heard the sound of men marching in the wood behind\nthem, and they turned about and saw that there was come Wood-wise,\nand with him upwards of two score and ten of the bowmen of the\nWoodlanders and the Wolf--huntsmen, cragsmen, and scourers of the\nWaste; men who could shoot the chaffinch on the twig a hundred yards\naloof; who could make a hiding-place of the bennets of the wayside\ngrass, or the stem of the slender birch-tree.  With these must needs\nbe Bow-may, who was the closest shooter of all the kindreds.\n\nSo then Wood-wise told the War-leader that Dallach had given the word\nto the Host, and that all men were astir and would be there presently\nin their ordered companies; and Face-of-god spake to Folk-might, and\nsaid:  'Chief of the Wolf, wilt thou not give command to these\nbowmen, and set them to the work; for thou wottest thereof.'\n\n'Yea, that will I,' said Folk-might, and turned to Wood-wise, and\nsaid:  'Wood-wise, get ye down the slope, and loose on these felons,\nwho have a murder on hand, if so be ye have a chance to do it wisely.\nBut in any case come ye all back; for all shall be needed yet to-day.\nSo flee if they pursue, for ye shall have us to flee to.  Now be ye\nwary, nor let the curse of the Wolf and the Face lie on your\nslothfulness.'\n\nWood-wise did but nod his head and lift his hand to his fellows, who\nset off after him down the slope without more tarrying.  They went\nvery warily, as if they were hunting a quarry which would flee from\nthem; and they crept amongst the grass and stones from bush to bush\nlike serpents, and so, unseen by the Dusky Men, who indeed were\nbusied over their own matters, they came to the fringe of bushes\nabove the broken ground aforesaid, and there they took their stand,\nand before them below those steep banks was but the space at the back\nof the houses.  As to the houses, as aforesaid, they were not so high\nas elsewhere about the Market-place; and at the end of a long low\nhall there was a gap between its gable and the next house, whereby\nthey had a clear sight of the Place about the god's altar and the\nbanners, and the great hall of Silver-dale, with the double stair\nthat went up to the door thereof.\n\nThere then they made them ready, and Wood-wise set men to watch that\nnone should come sidelong on them unawares; their bows were bent and\ntheir quivers open, and they were eager for the fray.\n\nThus they beheld the Market-place from their cover, and saw that\nthose folk who were to be hewn to the god were now standing facing\nthe altar in a half-ring, and behind them in another half-ring the\nglaive-bearers who had brought them thither stood glaive in hand\nready to hew them down when the token should be given; and these were\nindeed the priests of the god.\n\nThere was clear space round about these poor slaughter-thralls, so\nthat the bowmen could see them well, and they told up a score of\nthem, half men, half women, and they were all stark naked save for\nwreaths of flowers about their middles and their necks; and they had\nshackles of lead about their wrists; which same lead should be taken\nout of the fire wherein they should be burned, and from the shape it\nshould take after it had passed through the fire would the priests\nforetell the luck of the deed to be done.\n\nIt was clear to be seen from thence that Folk-might was right when he\nsaid that these slaughter-thralls were of the best of the house-\nthralls and bed-mates of the Dusky Men, and that these felons were\nopen-handed to their god, and would not cheat him, or withhold from\nhim the best and most delicate of all they had.\n\nNow spake Wood-wise to those about him:  'It is sure that Folk-might\nwould have us give these poor thralls a chance, and that we must\nloose upon the felons who would hew them down; and if we are to come\nback again, we can go no nigher.  What sayest thou, Bow-may?  Is it\nnigh enough?  Can aught be done?'\n\n'Yea, yea,' she said, 'nigh enough it is; but let Gold-ring be with\nme and half a score of the very best, whether they be of our folk or\nthe Woodlanders, men who cannot miss such a mark; and when we have\nloosed, then let all loose, and stay not till our shot be spent.\nHaste, now haste! time presseth; for if the Host showeth on the brow\nof the hill, these felons will hew down their slaughter-beasts before\nthey turn on their foemen.  Let the grey-goose wing speed trouble and\nconfusion amongst them.'\n\nBut ere she had done her words Wood-wise had got to speaking quietly\nwith the Woodlanders; and Bears-bane, who was amidst them, chose out\neight of the best of his folk, men who doubted nothing of hitting\nwhatever they could see in the Market-place; and they took their\nstand for shooting, and with them besides Bow-may were two women and\nfour men of the Wolf, and Gold-ring withal, a carle of fifty winters,\nlong, lean, and wiry, a fell shooter if ever anyone were.\n\nSo all these notched their shafts and laid them on the yew, and each\nhad between the two last fingers of the shaft-hand another shaft\nready, and a half score more stuck into the ground before him.\n\nNow giveth Wood-wise the word to these sixteen as to which of the\nfelons with the glaives they shall each one aim at; and he saith\nwithal in a soft voice:  'Help cometh from the Hill; soon shall\nbattle be joined in Silver-dale.'\n\nThus stand they watching Bow-may and Gold-ring till they draw home\nthe notches; and amidst their waiting the glaive-bearing felons fall\na-singing a harsh and ugly hymn to their crooked-sword god, and the\nMarket-stead is thronged endlong and overthwart with the tribes of\nthe Dusky Men.\n\nThere now standeth Bow-may far-sighted and keen-eyed, her face as\npale as a linen sleeve, an awful smile on her glittering eyes and\nclose-set lips, and she feeling the twisted string of the red yew and\nthe polished sides of the notch, while the yelling song of the Dusky\npriests quavers now and ends with a wild shrill cry, and she noteth\nthe midmost of the priests beginning to handle his weapon:  then\nswift and steady she draweth home the notches, while the yew bow\nstandeth still as the oak-bole ere the summer storm ariseth, and the\ntwang of the sixteen strings maketh but one fell sound as the\nfeathered bane of men goeth on its way.\n\nThere was silence for a moment of time in the Market of Silver-stead,\nas if the bolt of the Gods had fallen there; and then arose a huge\nwordless yell from those about the altar, and one of the priests who\nwas left hove up his glaive two-handed to smite the naked slaughter-\nthralls; but or ever the stroke fell, Bow-may's second shaft was\nthrough his throat, and he rolled over amidst his dead fellows; and\nthe other fifteen had loosed with her, and then even as they could\nWood-wise and the others of their company; and all they notched and\nloosed without tarrying, and no shout, no word came from their lips,\nonly the twanging strings spake for them; for they deemed the minutes\nthat hurried by were worth much joy of their lives to be.  And few\nindeed were the passing minutes ere the dead men lay in heaps about\nthe Altar of the Crooked Sword, and the wounded men wallowed amidst\nthem.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.  OF THE ONSLAUGHT OF THE MEN OF THE STEER, THE BRIDGE,\nAND THE BULL\n\n\n\nWild was the turmoil and confusion in the Market-stead; for the more\npart of the men therein knew not what had befallen about the altar,\nthough some clomb up to the top of that stack of faggots built for\nthe burning of the thralls, and when they saw what was toward fell to\nyelling and cursing; and their fellows on the plain Place could not\nhear their story for the clamour, and they also fell to howling as if\na wood full of wild dogs was there.\n\nAnd still the shafts rained down on that throng from the Bent of the\nBowmen, for another two score men of the Woodlanders had crept down\nthe hill to them, and shafts failed them not.  But the Dusky Men\nabout the altar, for all their terror, or even maybe because of it,\nnow began to turn upon the scarce-seen foemen, and to press up wildly\ntoward the hill-side, though as it were without any order or aim.\nEvery man of them had his weapons, and those no mere gilded toys, but\ntheir very tools of battle; and some, but no great number, had their\nbows with them and a few shafts; and these began to shoot at\nwhatsoever they could see on the hill-side, but at first so wildly\nand hurriedly that they did no harm.\n\nIt must be said of them that at first only those about the altar fell\non toward the hill; for those about the road that led southward knew\nnot what had betided nor whither to turn.  So that at this beginning\nof the battle, of all the thousands in the great Place it was but a\nfew hundreds that set on the Bent of the Bowmen, and at these the\nbowmen of the kindreds shot so close and so wholly together that they\nfell one over another in the narrow ways between the houses whereby\nthey must needs go to gather on the plain ground betwixt the backs of\nthe houses and the break of the hill-side.  But little by little the\narchers of the Dusky Men gathered behind the corpses of the slain,\nand fell to shooting at what they could see of the men of the\nkindreds, which at that while was not much, for as bold as they were,\nthey fought like wary hunters of the Wood and the Waste.\n\nBut now at last throughout all that throng of Felons in the Market-\nplace the tale began to spread of foemen come into the Dale and\nshooting from the Bents, and all they turned their faces to the hill,\nand the whole set of the throng was thitherward; though they fared\nbut slowly, so evil was the order of them, each man hindering his\nneighbour as he went.  And not only did the Dusky Men come flockmeal\ntoward the Bent of the Bowmen, but also they jostled along toward the\nroad that led southward.  That beheld Wood-wise from the Bent, and he\nwas minded to get him and his aback, now that they had made so great\na slaughter of the foemen; and two or three of his fellows had been\nhurt by arrows, and Bow-may, she would have been slain thrice over\nbut for the hammer-work of the Alderman.  And no marvel was that; for\nnow she stood on a little mound not half covered by a thin thorn-\nbush, and notched and loosed at whatever was most notable, as though\nshe were shooting at the mark on a summer evening in Shadowy Vale.\nBut as Wood-wise was at point to give the word to depart, from behind\nthem rang out the merry sound of the Burgdale horns, and he turned to\nlook at the wood-side, and lo! thereunder was the hill bright and\ndark with men-at-arms, and over them floated the Banners of the Wolf,\nand the Banners of the Steer, the Bridge, and the Bull.  Then gave\nforth the bowmen of the kindreds their first shout, and they made no\nstay in their shooting; but shot the eagerer, for they deemed that\nhelp would come without their turning about to draw it to them:  and\neven so it was.  For straightway down the bent came striding Face-of-\ngod betwixt the two Banners of the Wolf, and beside him were Red-wolf\nthe tall and War-grove, and therewithal Wood-wont and Wood-wicked,\nand many other men of the Wolf; for now that the men of the kindreds\nhad been brought face to face with the foe, and there was less need\nof them for way-leaders, the more part of them were liefer to fight\nunder their own banner along with the Woodlanders; so that the\ncompany of those who went under the Wolves was more than three long\nhundreds and a half; and the bowmen on the edge of the bent shouted\nagain and merrily, when they felt that their brothers were amongst\nthem, and presently was the arrow-storm at its fiercest, and the\ntwanging of bow-strings and the whistle of the shafts was as the wind\namong the clefts of the mountains; for all the new-comers were bowmen\nof the best.\n\nBut the kindreds of the Steer, the Bridge, and the Bull, they hung\nyet a while longer on the hills' brow, their banners floating over\nthem and their horns blowing; and the Dusky Felons in the Market-\nplace beheld them, and fear and rage at once filled their hearts, and\na fierce and dreadful yell brake out from them, and joyously did the\nMen of Burgdale answer them, and song arose amongst them even such as\nthis:\n\n\nThe Men of the Bridge sing:\n\nWhy stand ye together, why bear ye the shield,\nNow the calf straineth tether at edge of the field?\n\nNow the lamb bleateth stronger and waters run clear,\nAnd the day groweth longer and glad is the year?\n\nNow the mead-flowers jostle so thick as they stand,\nAnd singeth the throstle all over the land?\n\nThe Men of the Steer sing:\n\nNo cloud the day darkened, no thunder we heard,\nBut the horns' speech we hearkened as men unafeared.\n\nYea, so merry it sounded, we turned from the Dale,\nWhere all wealth abounded, to wot of its tale.\n\nThe Men of the Bridge sing:\n\nWhat white boles then bear ye, what wealth of the woods?\nWhat chafferers hear ye bid loud for your goods?\n\nThe Men of the Bull sing:\n\nO the bright beams we carry are stems of the steel;\nNor long shall we tarry across them to deal.\n\nHark the men of the cheaping, how loudly they cry\nOn the hook for the reaping of men doomed to die!\n\nThey all sing:\n\nHeave spear up! fare forward, O Men of the Dale!\nFor the Warrior, our war-ward, shall hearken the tale.\n\n\nTherewith they ceased a moment, and then gave a great and hearty\nshout all together, and all their horns blew, and they moved on down\nthe hill as one man, slowly and with no jostling, the spear-men\nfirst, and then they of the axe and the sword; and on their flanks\nthe deft archers loosed on the stumbling jostling throng of the Dusky\nMen, who for their part came on drifting and surging up the road to\nthe hill.\n\nBut when those big spearmen of the Dale had gone a little way the\nhorns' voice died out, and their great-staved spears rose up from\ntheir shoulders into the air, and stood so a moment, and then slowly\nfell forward, as the oars of the longship fall into the row-locks,\nand then over the shoulders of the foremost men showed the steel of\nthe five ranks behind them, and their own spears cast long bars of\nshadow on the whiteness of the sunny road.  No sound came from them\nnow save the rattle of their armour and the tramp of their steady\nfeet; but from the Dusky Men rose up hideous confused yelling, and\nthose that could free themselves from the tangle of the throng rushed\ndesperately against the on-rolling hedge of steel, and the whole\nthrong shoved on behind them.  Then met steel and men; here and there\nan ash-stave broke; here and there a Dusky Felon rolled himself\nunhurt under the ash-staves, and hewed the knees of the Dalesmen, and\na tall man came tottering down; but what men or wood-wights could\nendure the push of spears of those mighty husbandmen?  The Dusky Ones\nshrunk back yelling, or turned their backs and rushed at their own\nfolk with such fierce agony that they entered into the throng, till\nthe terror of the spear reached to the midmost of it and swayed them\nback on the hindermost; for neither was there outgate for the felons\non the flanks of the spearmen, since there the feathered death beset\nthem, and the bowmen (and the Bride amongst the foremost) shot wholly\ntogether, and no shaft flew idly.  But the wise leaders of the\nDalesmen would not that they should thrust in too far amongst the\nhowling throng of the Dusky Men, lest they should be hemmed in by\nthem; for they were but a handful in regard to them:  so there they\nstayed, barring the way to the Dusky Men, and the bowmen still loosed\nfrom the flanks of them, or aimed deftly from betwixt the ranks of\nthe spearmen.\n\nAnd now was there a space of ten strides or more betwixt the Dalesmen\nand their foes, over which the spears hung terribly, nor durst the\nDusky Men adventure there; and thereon was nought but men dead or\nsorely hurt.  Then suddenly a horn rang thrice shrilly over all the\nnoise and clamour of the throng, and the ranks of the spearmen\nopened, and forth into that space strode two score of the swordsmen\nand axe-wielders of the Dale, their weapons raised in their hands,\nand he who led them was Iron-hand of the House of the Bull:  tall he\nwas, wide-shouldered, exceeding strong, but beardless and fair-faced.\nHe bore aloft a two-edged sword, broad-bladed, exceeding heavy, so\nthat few men could wield it in battle, but not right long; it was an\nancient weapon, and his father before him had called it the Barley-\nscythe.  With him were some of the best of the kindreds, as Wolf of\nWhitegarth, Long-hand of Oakholt, Hart of Highcliff, and War-well the\ncaptain of the Bridge.  These made no tarrying on that space of the\ndead, but cried aloud their cries:  'For the Burg and the Steer! for\nthe Dale and the Bridge! for the Dale and the Bull!' and so fell at\nonce on the Felons; who fled not, nor had room to flee; and also they\nfeared not the edge-weapons so sorely as they feared those huge\nspears.  So they turned fiercely on the swordsmen, and chiefly on\nIron-hand, as he entered in amongst them the first of all, hewing to\nthe right hand and the left, and many a man fell before the Barley-\nscythe; for they were but little before him.  Yet as one fell another\ntook his place, and hewed at him with the steel axe and the crooked\nsword; and with many strokes they clave his shield and brake his helm\nand rent his byrny, while he heeded little save smiting with the\nBarley-scythe, and the blood ran from his arm and his shoulder and\nhis thigh.\n\nBut War-well had entered in among the foe on his left hand, and\nunshielded hove up a great broad-bladed axe, that clave the iron\nhelms of the Dusky Men, and rent their horn-scaled byrnies.  He was\nnot very tall, but his shoulders were huge and his arms long, and\nnought could abide his stroke.  He cleared a ring round Iron-hand,\nwhose eyes were growing dim as the blood flowed from him, and hewed\nthree strokes before him; then turned and drew the champion out of\nthe throng, and gave him into the arms of his fellows to stanch the\nblood that drained away the might of his limbs; and then with a great\nwordless roar leaped back again on the Dusky Men as the lion leapeth\non the herd of swine; and they shrank away before him; and all the\nswordsmen shouted, 'For the Bridge, for the Bridge!' and pressed on\nthe harder, smiting down all before them.  On his left hand now was\nHart of Highcliff wielding a good sword hight Chip-driver, wherewith\nhe had slain and hurt a many, fighting wisely with sword and shield,\nand driving the point home through the joints of the armour.  But\neven therewith, as he drave a great stroke at a lord of the Dusky\nOnes, a cast-spear came flying and smote him on the breast, so that\nhe staggered, and the stroke fell flatlings on the shield-boss of his\nfoe, and Chip-driver brake atwain nigh the hilts; but Hart closed\nwith him, and smote him on the face with the pommel, and tore his axe\nfrom his hand and clave his skull therewith, and slew him with his\nown weapon, and fought on valiantly beside War-well.\n\nNow War-well had fought so fiercely that he had rent his own hauberk\nwith the might of his strokes, and as he raised his arm to smite a\nhuge stroke, a deft man of the Felons thrust the spike of his war-axe\nup under his arm; and when War-well felt the smart of the steel, he\nturned on that man, and, letting his axe fall down to his wrist and\nhang there by its loop, he caught the foeman up by the neck and the\nbreech, and drave him against the other Dusky Ones before him, so\nthat their weapons pierced and rent their own friend and fellow.\nThen he put forth the might of his arms and the pith of his body, and\nhove up that felon and cast him on to the heads of his fellow murder-\ncarles, so that he rent them and was rent by them.  Then War-well\nfell on again with the axe, and all the champions of the Dale shouted\nand fell on with him, and the foe shrank away; and the Dalesmen\ncleared a space five fathoms' length before them, and the spearmen\ndrew onward and stood on the space whereon the first onslaught had\nbeen.\n\nThen drew those hewers of the Dale together, and forth from the\ncompany came the man that bare the Banner of the Bridget and the\nchampions gathered round him, and they ordered their ranks and strode\nwith the Banner before them three times to and fro across the road\nathwart the front of the spearmen, and then with a great shout drew\nback within the spear-hedge.  Albeit five of the champions of the\nDale had been slain outright there, and the more part of them hurt\nmore or less.\n\nBut when all were well within the ranks, once again blew the horn,\nand all the spears sank to the rest, and the kindreds drave the\nspear-furrow, and a space was swept clear before them, and the cries\nand yells of the Dusky Men were so fierce and wild that the rough\nvoices of the Dalesmen were drowned amidst them.\n\nForth then came every bowman of the kindred that was there and loosed\non the Dusky Men; and they forsooth had some bowmen amongst them, but\ncooped up and jostled as they were they shot but wildly; whereas each\nshaft of the Dale went home truly.\n\nBut amongst the bowmen forth came the Bride in her glittering war-\ngear, and stepped lightly to the front of the spearmen.  Her own yew\nbow had been smitten by a shaft and broken in her hand:  so she had\ncaught up a short horn bow and a quiver from one of the slain of the\nDusky Men; and now she knelt on one knee under the shadow of the\nspears nigh to her grandsire Hall-ward, and with a pale face and\nknitted brow notched and loosed, and notched and loosed on the throng\nof foemen, as if she were some daintily fashioned engine of war.\n\nSo fared the battle on the road that went from the south into the\nMarket-stead.  Valiantly had the kindred fought there, and no man of\nthem had blenched, and much had they won; but the way was perilous\nbefore them, for the foe was many and many.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV.  OF FACE-OF-GOD'S ONSLAUGHT\n\n\n\nNow the banners of the Wolf flapped and rippled over the heads of the\nWoodlanders and the Men of the Wolf; and the men shot all they might,\nnor took heed now to cover themselves against the shafts of the Dusky\nMen.  As for these, for all they were so many, their arrow-shot was\nno great matter, for they were in very evil order, as has been said;\nand moreover, their rage was so great to come to handy strokes with\nthese foemen, that some of them flung away their bows to brandish the\naxe or the sword.  Nevertheless were some among the kindred hurt or\nslain by their arrows.\n\nNow stood Face-of-god with the foremost; and from where he stood he\ncould see somewhat of the battle of the Dalesmen, and he wotted that\nit was thriving; therefore he looked before him and close around him,\nand noted what was toward there.  The space betwixt the houses and\nthe break of the bent was crowded with the fury of the Dusky Men\ntossing their weapons aloft, crying to each other and at the kindred,\nand here and there loosing a bow-string on them; but whatever was\ntheir rage they might not come a many together past a line within ten\nfathom of the bent's end; for three hundred of the best of bowmen\nwere shooting at them so ceaselessly that no Dusky man was safe of\nany bare place of his body, and they fell over one another in that\npenfold of slaughter, and for all their madness did but little.\n\nYet was the heart of the War-leader troubled; for he wotted that it\nmight not last for ever, and there seemed no end to the throng of\nmurder-carles; and the time would come when the arrowshot would be\nspent, and they must needs come to handy strokes, and that with so\nmany.\n\nNow a voice spake to him as he gazed with knitted brows and careful\nheart on that turmoil of battle:\n\n'What now hast thou done with the Sun-beam, and where is her brother?\nIs the Chief of the Wolf skulking when our work is so heavy?  And\nthou meseemeth art overlate on the field:  the mowing of this meadow\nis no sluggard's work.'\n\nHe turned and beheld Bow-may, and gazed on her face for a moment, and\nsaw her eyes how they glittered, and how the pommels of her cheeks\nwere burning red and her lips dry and grey; but before he answered he\nlooked all round about to see what was to note; and he touched Bow-\nmay on the shoulder and pointed to down below where a man of the\nFelons had just come out of the court of one of the houses:  a man\ntaller than most, very gaily arrayed, with gilded scales all over\nhim, so that, with his dark face and blue eyes, he looked like some\nstrange dragon.  Bow-may spake not, but stamped her foot with anger.\nYet if her heart were hot, her hand was steady; for she notched a\nshaft, and just as the Dusky Chief raised his axe and brandished it\naloft, she loosed, and the shaft flew and smote the felon in the\narmpit and the default of the armour, and he fell to earth.  But even\nas she loosed, Face-of-god cried out in a loud voice:\n\n'O lads of battle! shoot close and all together.  Tarry not, tarry\nnot! for we need a little time ere sword meets sword, and the others\nof the kindreds are at work!'\n\nBut Bow-may turned round to him and said:  'Wilt thou not answer me?\nWhere is thy kindness gone?'\n\nEven as she was speaking she had notched and loosed another shaft,\nspeaking as folk do who turn from busy work at loom or bench.\n\nThen said Face-of-god:  'Shoot on, sister Bow-may!  The Sun-beam is\ngone with her brother, and he is with the Men of the Face.'\n\nHe broke off here, for a man fell beside him hurt in the neck, and\nFace-of-god took his bow from his hands and shot a shaft, while one\nof the women who had been hurt also tended the newly-wounded man.\nThen Face-of-god went on speaking:\n\n'She was unwilling to go, but Folk-might and I constrained her; for\nwe knew that this is the most perilous place of the battle--hah! see\nthose three felons, Bow-may! they are aiming hither.'\n\nAnd again he loosed and Bow-may also, but a shaft rattled on his helm\nwithal and another smote a Woodlander beside him, and pierced through\nthe calf of his leg, as he turned and stooped to take fresh arrows\nfrom a sheaf that lay there; but the carle took it by the notch and\nthe point, and brake it and drew it out, and then stood up and went\non shooting.  And Face-of-god spake again:\n\n'Folk-might skulketh not; nor the Men of the Vine, and the Sickle,\nand the Face, nor the Shepherd-Folk:  soon shall they be making our\nwork easy to us, if we can hold our own till then.  They are on the\nother roads that lead into the square.  Now suffer me, and shoot on!'\n\nTherewith he looked round about him, and he saw on the left hand that\nall was quiet; and before him was the confused throng of the Dusky\nMen trampling their own dead and wounded, and not able as yet to\ncross that death-line of the arrow so near to them.  But on his right\nhand he saw how they of the kindreds held them firm on the way.  Then\nfor a moment of time he considered and thought, till him-seemed he\ncould see the whole battle yet to be foughten; and his face flushed,\nand he said sharply:  'Bow-may, abide here and shoot, and show the\nothers where to shoot, while the arrows hold out; but we will go\nfurther for a while, and ye shall follow when we have made the rent\ngreat enough.'\n\nShe turned to him and said:  'Why art thou not more joyous? thou art\nlike an host without music or banners.'\n\n'Nay,' said he, 'heed not me, but my bidding!'\n\nShe said hastily:  'I think I shall die here; since for all we have\nshot we minish them nowise.  Now kiss me this once amidst the battle,\nand say farewell.'\n\nHe said:  'Nay, nay; it shall not go thus.  Abide a little while, and\nthou shalt see all this tangle open, as the sun cleaveth the clouds\non the autumn morning.  Yet lo thou! since thou wilt have it so.'\n\nAnd he bent forward and kissed her face, and now the tears ran over\nit, and she said smiling somewhat:  'Now is this more than I looked\nfor, whatso may betide.'\n\nBut while she was yet speaking he cried in a great voice:\n\n'Ye who have spent your shot, or have nigh spent it, to axe and\nsword, and follow me to clear the ground 'twixt the bent and the\nhalls.  Let each help each, but throng not each other.  Shoot wisely,\nye bowmen, and keep our backs clear of the foe.  On, on! for the Burg\nand the Face, for the Burg and the Face!'\n\nTherewith he leapt down the steep of the hill, bounding like the\nhart, with Dale-warden naked in his hand; and they that followed were\ntwo score and ten; and the arrows of their bowmen rained over their\nheads on the Dusky Men, as they smote down the first of the foemen,\nand the others shrieked and shrank from them, or turned on them\nsmiting wildly and desperately.\n\nBut Face-of-god swept round the great sword and plunged into that sea\nof turmoil and noise and evil sights and savours, and even therewith\nhe heard clearly a voice that said:  'Goldring, I am hurt; take my\nbow a while!' and knew it for Bow-may's; but it came to his ears like\nthe song of a bird without meaning; for it was as if his life were\nchanged at once; and in a minute or two he had cut thrice with the\nedge and thrust twice with the point, eager, but clear-eyed and deft;\nand he saw as in a picture the foe before him, and the grey roofs of\nSilver-stead, and through the gap in them the tops of the blue ridges\nfar aloof.  And now had three fallen before him, and they feared him,\nand turned on him, and smote so many together that their strokes\ncrossed each other, and one warded him from the other; and he laughed\naloud and shielded himself, and drave the point of Dale-warden amidst\nthe tangle of weapons through the open mouth of a captain of the\nFelons, and slashed a cheek with a back-stroke, and swept round the\nedge to his right hand and smote off a blue-eyed snub-nosed head; and\ntherewith a pole-axe smote him on the left side of his helm, so that\nhe tottered; but he swung himself round, and stood stark and upright,\nand gave a short hack with the edge, keeping Dale-warden well in\nhand, and a gold-clad felon, a champion of them, and their tallest on\nthe ground, fell aback, his throat gaping more than the mouth of him.\n\nThen Face-of-god shouted and waved Dale-warden aloft to the Banner of\nthe Wolf that floated behind and above him, and he cried out:  'As I\nhave promised so have I done!'  And he looked about, and beheld how\nvaliantly his fellows had been doing; for before him now was a space\nof earth with no man standing on his feet thereon, like the swathe of\nthe mowers of June; and beyond that was the crowd of the Dusky Men\nwavering like the tall grass abiding the scythe.\n\nBut a minute, and they fell to casting at Face-of-god and his fellows\nspears and knives and shields and whatsoever would fly; and a spear\nsmote him on the breast, but entered not; and a bossed shield fell\nover his face withal, and a plummet of sling-lead smote his helm, and\nhe fell to earth; but leapt up again straightway, and heard as he\narose a great shout close to him, and a shrill cry, and lo! at his\nleft side Bow-may, her sword in her hand, and the hand red with blood\nfrom a shaft-graze on her wrist, and a white cloth stained with blood\nabout her neck; and on his right side Wood-wise bearing the banner\nand crying the Wolf-whoop; for the whole company was come down from\nthe slope and stood around him.\n\nThen for a little while was there such a stilling of the tumult about\nhim there, that he heard great and glad cries from the Road of the\nSouth of 'The Burg and the Steer!  The Dale and the Bridge!  The Dale\nand the Bull!'  And thereafter a terrible great shrieking cry, and a\nhuge voice that cried:  'Death, death, death to the Dusky Men!'  And\nthereafter again fierce cries and great tumult of the battle.\n\nThen Face-of-god shook Dale-warden in the air, and strode forward\nfiercely, but not speedily, and the whole company went foot for foot\nalong with him; and as he went, would he or would he not, song came\ninto his mouth, a song of the meadows of the Dale, even such as this:\n\n\nThe wheat is done blooming and rust's on the sickle,\n   And green are the meadows grown after the scythe.\nCome, hands for the dance!  For the toil hath been mickle,\n   And 'twixt haysel and harvest 'tis time to be blithe.\n\nAnd what shall the tale be now dancing is over,\n   And kind on the meadow sits maiden by man,\nAnd the old man bethinks him of days of the lover,\n   And the warrior remembers the field that he wan?\n\nShall we tell of the dear days wherein we are dwelling,\n   The best days of our Mother, the cherishing Dale,\nWhen all round about us the summer is telling,\n   To ears that may hearken, the heart of the tale?\n\nShall we sing of these hands and these lips that caress us,\n   And the limbs that sun-dappled lie light here beside,\nWhen still in the morning they rise but to bless us,\n   And oft in the midnight our footsteps abide?\n\nO nay, but to tell of the fathers were better,\n   And of how we were fashioned from out of the earth;\nOf how the once lowly spurned strong at the fetter;\n   Of the days of the deeds and beginning of mirth.\n\nAnd then when the feast-tide is done in the morning,\n   Shall we whet the grey sickle that bideth the wheat,\nTill wan grow the edges, and gleam forth a warning\n   Of the field and the fallow where edges shall meet.\n\nAnd when cometh the harvest, and hook upon shoulder\n   We enter the red wheat from out of the road,\nWe shall sing, as we wend, of the bold and the bolder,\n   And the Burg of their building, the beauteous abode.\n\nAs smiteth the sickle amid the sun's burning\n   We shall sing how the sun saw the token unfurled,\nWhen forth fared the Folk, with no thought of returning,\n   In the days when the Banner went wide in the world.\n\n\nMany saw that he was singing, but heard not the words of his mouth,\nfor great was the noise and clamour.  But he heard Bow-may, how she\nlaughed by his side, and cried out:\n\n'Gold-mane, dear-heart, now art thou merry indeed; and glad am I,\nthough they told me that I am hurt.--Ah! now beware, beware!'\n\nFor indeed the Dusky Men, seeing the wall of steel rolling down on\nthem, and cooped up by the houses, so that they scarce knew how to\nflee, turned in the face of death, the foremost of them, and rushed\nfuriously on the array of the Woodlanders, and all those behind\npressed on them like the big wave of the ebbing sea when the gust of\nthe wind driveth it landward.\n\nThe Woodlanders met them, shouting out:  'The Greenwood and the Wolf,\nthe Greenwood and the Wolf!'  But not a few of them fell there,\nthough they gave not back a foot; for so fierce now were the Dusky\nMen, that hewing and thrusting at them availed nought, unless they\nwere slain outright or stunned; and even if they fell they rolled\nthemselves up against their tall foe-men, heeding not death or wounds\nif they might but slay or wound.  There then fell War-grove and ten\nothers of the Woodlanders, and four men of the Wolf, but none before\nhe had slain his foeman; and as each man fell or was hurt grievously,\nanother took his place.\n\nNow a felon leapt up and caught Gold-ring by the neck and drew him\ndown, while another strove to smite his head off; but the stout carle\ndrave a wood-knife into the side of the first felon, and drew it out\nspeedily and smote the other, the smiter, in the face with the same\nknife, and therewith they all three rolled together on the earth\namongst the feet of men.  Even so did another felon by Bow-may, and\ndragged her down to the ground, and smote her with a long knife as\nshe tumbled down; and this was a feat of theirs, for they were long-\narmed like apes.\n\nBut as to this felon, Dale-warden's edge split his skull, and Face-\nof-god gathered his might together and bestrode Bow-may, till he had\nhewed a space round about him with great two-handed strokes; and yet\nthe blade brake not.  Then he caught up Bow-may from the earth, and\nthe felon's knife had not pierced her hauberk, but she was astonied,\nand might not stand upon her feet; and Face-of-god turned aside a\nlittle with her, and half bore her, half thrust her through the\nthrong to the rearward of his folk, and left her there with two\ncarlines of the Wolf who followed the host for leechcraft's sake, and\nthen turned back shouting:  'For the Face, for the Face!' and there\nfollowed him back to the battle, a band of those who were fresh as\nyet, and their blades unbloodied, the young men of the Woodlands.\n\nThe wearier fighters made way for them as they came on shouting, and\nFace-of-god was ahead of them all, and leapt at the foemen as a man\nunwearied and striking his first stroke, so wondrous hale he was; and\nthey drave a wedge amidst of the Dusky Men, and then turned about and\nstood back to back hewing at all that drifted on them.  But as Face-\nof-god cleared a space about him, lo! almost within reach of his\nsword-point up rose a grim shape from the earth, tall, grey-haired,\nand bloody-faced, who uttered the Wolf-whoop from amidst the terror\nof his visage, and turned and swung round his head an axe of the\nDusky Men, and fell to smiting them with their own weapon.  The Dusky\nMen shrieked in answer to his whoop, and all shrunk from him and\nFace-of-god; but a cry of joy went up from the kindred, for they knew\nGold-ring, whom they deemed had been slain.  So they all pressed on\ntogether, smiting down the foe before them, and the Dusky Men, some\nturned their backs and drave those behind them, till they too turned\nand were strained through the passages and courts of the houses, and\nsome were overthrown and trodden down as they strove to hold face to\nthe Woodlanders, and some were hewn down where they stood; but the\nwhole throng of those that were on their feet drifted toward the\nMarket-place, the Woodlanders following them ever with point and\nedge, till betwixt the bent and the houses no foeman stood up against\nthem.\n\nThen they stood together, and raised the whoop of victory, and blew\ntheir horns long and loud in token of their joy, and the Woodland men\nlifted up their voices and sang:\n\n\n   Now far, far aloof\n   Standeth lintel and roof,\n   The dwelling of days\n   Of the Woodland ways:\n   Now nought wendeth there\n   Save the wolf and the bear,\n   And the fox of the waste\n   Faring soft without haste.\nNo carle the axe whetteth on oak-laden hill;\nNo shaft the hart letteth to wend at his will;\nNone heedeth the thunder-clap over the glade,\nAnd the wind-storm thereunder makes no man afraid.\nIs it thus then that endeth man's days on Mid-earth,\nFor no man there wendeth in sorrow or mirth?\n\n   Nay, look down on the road\n   From the ancient abode!\n   Betwixt acre and field\n   Shineth helm, shineth shield.\n   And high over the heath\n   Fares the bane in his sheath;\n   For the wise men and bold\n   Go their ways o'er the wold.\nNow the Warrior hath given them heart and fair day,\nUnbidden, undriven, they fare to the fray.\nBy the rock and the river the banners they bear,\nAnd their battle-staves quiver 'neath halbert and spear;\nOn the hill's brow they gather, and hang o'er the Dale\nAs the clouds of the Father hang, laden with bale.\n\n   Down shineth the sun\n   On the war-deed half done;\n   All the fore-doomed to die,\n   In the pale dust they lie.\n   There they leapt, there they fell,\n   And their tale shall we tell;\n   But we, e'en in the gate\n   Of the war-garth we wait,\nTill the drift of war-weather shall whistle us on,\nAnd we tread all together the way to be won,\nTo the dear land, the dwelling for whose sake we came\nTo do deeds for the telling of song-becrowned fame.\nSettle helm on the head then!  Heave sword for the Dale!\nNor be mocked of the dead men for deedless and pale.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI.  MEN MEET IN THE MARKET OF SILVER-STEAD\n\n\n\nSo sang they; but Face-of-god went with Red-wolf, who was hurt\nsorely, but not deadly, and led him back toward the place just under\nthe break of the bent; and there he found Bow-may in the hands of the\nwomen who were tending her hurts.  She smiled on him from a pale face\nas he drew nigh, and he looked kindly at her, but he might not abide\nthere, for haste was in his feet.  He left Red-wolf to the tending of\nthe women, and clomb the bent hastily, and when he deemed he was high\nenough, he looked about him; and somewhat more than half an hour had\nworn since Bow-may had sped the first shaft against the Dusky Men.\n\nHe looked down into the Market-stead, and deemed he could see that\nnigh the Mote-house the Dusky Men were gathering into some better\norder; but they were no longer drifting toward the southern bents,\nbut were standing round about the altar as men abiding somewhat; and\nhe deemed that they had gotten more bowshot than before, and that\nmost of them bare bows.  Though so many had been slain in the battles\nof the southern bents, yet was the Market-stead full of them, so to\nsay, for others had come thereto in place of those that had fallen.\n\nBut now as he looked arose mighty clamour amongst them; and a little\nwest of the Altar was a stir and a hurrying onward and around as in\nthe eddies of a swift stream.  Face-of-god wotted not what was\nbetiding there, but he deemed that they were now ware of the onfall\nof Folk-might and Hall-face and the men of Burgdale, for their faces\nwere all turned to where that was to be looked for.\n\nSo he turned and looked on the road to the east of him, where had\nbeen the battle of the Steer, but now it was all gone down toward the\nMarket-place, and he could but hear the clamour of it; but nought he\nsaw thereof, because of the houses that hid it.\n\nThen he cast his eyes on the road that entered the Market-stead from\nthe north, and he saw thereon many men gathered; and he wotted not\nwhat they were; for though there were weapons amongst them, yet were\nthey not all weaponed, as far as he could see.\n\nNow as he looked this way and that, and deemed that he must tarry no\nlonger, but must enter into the courts of the houses before him and\nmake his way into the Market-stead, lo! a change in the throng of\nDusky Warriors nigh the Mote-house, and the ordered bands about the\nAltar fell to drifting toward the western way with one accord, with\ngreat noise and hurry and fierce cries of wrath.  Then made Face-of-\ngod no delay, but ran down the bent at once, and at the break of it\ncame upon Bow-may standing upright and sword in hand; and as he\npassed, she joined herself to him, and said:  'What new tidings now,\nGold-mane?'\n\n'Tidings of battle!' he cried; 'tidings of victory!  Folk-might hath\nfallen on, and the Dusky Men run hastily to meet him.  Hark, hark!'\n\nFor as he spoke came a great noise of horns, and Bow-may said:  'What\nhorn is that blowing?'\n\nHe stayed not, but shouted aloud:  'For the Face, for the Face!  Now\nwill we fall upon their backs!'\n\nTherewith was he come to his company, and he cried out to them:\n'Heard ye the horn, heard ye the horn?  Now follow me into the\nMarket-place; much is yet to do!'\n\nEven therewith came the sound of other horns, and all men were silent\na moment, and then shouted all together, for the Wood-landers knew it\nfor the horn of the Shepherds coming on by the eastward way.\n\nBut Face-of-god waved his sword aloft and set on at once, and they\nfollowed and gat them through the courts of the houses and their\npassages into the Market-place.  There they found more room than they\nlooked to find; for the foemen had drawn away on the left hand toward\nthe battle of Folk-might, and on the right hand toward the battle of\nthe Steer; and great was the noise and cry that came thence.\n\nNow stood Face-of-god under the two banners of the Wolf in the\nMarket-place of Silver-stead, and scarce had he time to be high-\nhearted, for needs must he ponder in his mind what thing were best to\ndo.  For on the left hand he deemed the foe was the strongest and\nbest ordered; but there also were the kindreds the doughtiest, and it\nwas little like that the felons should overcome the spear-casters of\nthe Face and the glaive-bearers of the Sickle, and the bowmen of the\nVine:  there also were the wisest leaders, as the stark elder Stone-\nface, and the tall Hall-face, and his father of the unshaken heart,\nand above all Folk-might, fierce in his wrath, but his anger burning\nsteady and clear, like the oaken butt on the hearth of the hall.\n\nThen as his mind pictured him amongst the foe, it made therewith\nanother picture of the slender warrior Sun-beam caught in the tangle\nof battle, and longing for him and calling for him amidst the hard\nhand-play.  And thereat his face flushed, and all his body waxed hot,\nand he was on the very point of leading the onset against the foe on\nthe left.  But therewith he bethought him of the bold men of the\nSteer and the Bridge and the Bull weary with much fighting; and he\nremembered also that the Bride was amongst them and fighting, it\nmight be, amidst the foremost, and if she were slain how should he\never hold up his head again.  He bethought him also that the\nShepherds, who had fallen on by the eastern road, valiant as they\nwere, were scarce so well armed or so well led as the others.\nTherewithal he bethought him (and again it came like a picture into\nhis mind) of falling on the foemen by whom the southern battle was\nbeset, and then the twain of them meeting the Shepherds, and lastly,\nall those three companies joined together clearing the Market-place,\nand meeting the men under Folk-might in the midst thereof.\n\nTherefore, scant had he been pondering these things in his mind for a\nminute ere he cried out:  'Blow up horns, blow up! forward banners,\nand follow me, O valiant men! to the helping of the Steer, the\nBridge, and the Bull; deep have they thrust into the Dusky Throng,\nand belike are hard pressed.  Hark how the clamour ariseth from their\nbesetters!  On now, on!'\n\nTherewith hung a star of sunlight on his sword as he raised it aloft,\nand the Wolf-whoop rang out terribly in the Market-place, for now had\nthe Woodlanders also learned it, and the hearts of the foemen sank as\nthey heard the might and the mass thereof.  Then the battle of the\nWoodlanders swept round and fell upon the flank of them who were\nbesetting the kindreds, as an iron bar smiteth the soft fir-wood; and\nthey of the kindreds heard their cry, but faintly and confusedly, so\ngreat was the turmoil of battle about them.\n\nNow once more was Bow-may by the side of Face-of-god; and if she had\nnot the might of the mightiest, yet had she the deftness of the\ndeftest.  And now was she calm and cool, shielding herself with a\ncopper-bossed target, and driving home the point of her sharp sword;\nwhite was her face, and her eyes glittered amidst it, and she seemed\nto men like to those on whose heads the Warrior hath laid the Holy\nBread.\n\nAs to Wood-wise, he had given the Banner of the red-jawed Wolf to\nStone-wolf, a huge and dreadful warrior some forty winters old, who\nhad fought in the Great Overthrow, and now hewed down the Dusky Men,\nwielding a heavy short-sword left-handed.  But Wood-wise himself\nfought with a great sword, giving great strokes to the right hand and\nthe left, and was no more hasty than is the hewer in the winter wood.\n\nFace-of-god fought wisely and coldly now, and looked more to warding\nhis friends than destroying his foes, and both to Bow-may and Wood-\nwise his sword was a shield; for oft he took the life from the edge\nof the upraised axe, and stayed the point of the foeman in mid-air.\n\nEven so wisely fought the whole band of the Woodlanders and the\nWolves, who got within smiting space of the foe; for they had no will\nto cast away their lives when assured victory was so nigh to them.\nSooth to say, the hand-play was not so hard to them as it had been\nbetwixt the bent and the houses; for the Dusky Men were intent on\ndealing with the men of the kindreds from the southern road, who\nstood war-wearied before them; and they were hewing and casting at\nthem, and baying and yelling like dogs; and though they turned about\nto meet the storm of the Woodlanders, yet their hearts failed them\nwithal, and they strove to edge away from betwixt those two fearful\nscythes of war, fighting as men fleeing, not as men in onset.  But\nstill the Woodlanders and the Wolves came on, hewing and thrusting,\nsmiting down the foemen in heaps, till the Dusky Throng grew thin,\nand the staves of the Dalesmen and their bright banners in the\nmorning sun were clear to see, and at last their very faces, kindly\nand familiar, worn and strained with the stress of battle, or\nlaughing wildly, or pale with the fury of the fight.  Then rose up to\nthe heavens the blended shout of the Woodlanders and the Dalesmen,\nand now there was nought of foemen betwixt them save the dead and the\nwounded.\n\nThen Face-of-god thrust his sword into its sheath all bloody as it\nwas, and strode over the dead men to where Hall-ward stood under the\nbanner of the Steer, and cast his arms about the old carle, and\nkissed him for joy of the victory.  But Hall-ward thrust him aback\nand looked him in the face, and his cheeks were pale and his lips\nclenched, and his eyes haggard and staring, and he said in a harsh\nvoice:\n\n'O young man, she is dead!  I saw her fall.  The Bride is dead, and\nthou hast lost thy troth-plight maiden. O death, death to the Dusky\nMen!'\n\nThen grew Face-of-god as pale as a linen sleeve, and all the new-\ncomers groaned and cried out.  But a bystander said:  'Nay, nay, it\nis nought so bad as that; she is hurt, and sorely; but she liveth\nyet.'\n\nFace-of-god heard him not.  He forgot Dale-warden lying in his\nsheath, and he saw that the last speaker had a great wood-axe broad\nand heavy in his hand, so he cried:  'Man, man, thine axe!' and\nsnatched it from him, and turned about to the foe again, and thrust\nthrough the ranks, suffering none to stay him till all his friends\nwere behind and all his foes before him.  And as he burst forth from\nthe ranks waving his axe aloft, bare-headed now, his yellow hair\nflying abroad, his mouth crying out, 'Death, death, death to the\nDusky Men!' fear of him smote their hearts, and they howled and fled\nbefore him as they might; for they said that the Dalesmen had prayed\ntheir Gods into the battle.  But not so fast could they flee but he\nwas presently amidst them, smiting down all about him, and they so\nterror-stricken that scarce might they raise a hand against him.  All\nthat blended host followed him mad with wrath and victory, and as\nthey pressed on, they heard behind them the horns and war-cries of\nthe Shepherds falling on from the east.  Nought they heeded that now,\nbut drave on a fearful storm of war, and terrible was the slaughter\nof the Felons.\n\nIt was but a few minutes ere they had driven them up against that\ngreat stack of faggots that had been dight for the burnt-offering of\nmen, and many of the felons had mounted up on to it, and now in their\nanguish of fear were shooting arrows and casting spears on all about\nthem, heeding little if they were friend or foe.  Now were the men of\nthe kindreds at point to climb this twiggen burg; but by this time\nthe fury of Face-of-god had run clear, and he knew where he was and\nwhat he was doing; so he stayed his folk, and cried out to them:\n'Forbear, climb not! let the torch help the sword!'  And therewith he\nlooked about and saw the fire-pot which had been set down there for\nthe kindling of the bale-fire, and the coals were yet red in it; so\nhe snatched up a dry brand and lighted it thereat, and so did divers\nothers, and they thrust them among the faggots, and the fire caught\nat once, and the tongues of flame began to leap from faggot to faggot\ntill all was in a light low; for the wood had been laid for that very\nend, and smeared with grease and oil so that the burning to the god\nmight be speedy.\n\nBut the fierceness of the kindreds heeded not the fire, nor overmuch\nthe men who leapt down from the stack before it, but they left all\nbehind them, faring straight toward the western outgate from the\nMarket-stead; and Face-of-god still led them on; though by now he was\nwholly come to his right mind again, albeit the burden of sorrow yet\nlay heavy on his heart.  He had broken his axe, and had once more\ndrawn Dale-warden from his sheath, and many felt his point and edge.\n\nBut now, as they chased, came a rush of men upon them again, as\nthough a new onset were at hand.  That saw Face-of-god and Hall-ward\nand War-well, and other wise leaders of men, and they bade their folk\nforbear the chase, and lock their ranks to meet the onfall of this\nnew wave of foemen.  And they did so, and stood fast as a wall; but\nlo! the onrush that drave up against them was but a fleeing shrieking\nthrong, and no longer an array of warriors, for many had cast away\ntheir weapons, and were rushing they knew not whither; for they were\nbeing thrust on the bitter edges of Face-of-god's companies by the\nterror of the fleers from the onset of the men of the Face, the\nSickle, and the Vine, whom Hall-face and Stone-face were leading,\nalong with Folk-might.  Then once again the men of Face-of-god gave\nforth the whoop of victory, and pressed forward again, hewing their\nway through the throng of fleers, but turning not to chase to the\nright or the left; while at their backs came on the Shepherd-folk,\nwho had swept down all that withstood them; for now indeed was the\nMarket-stead getting thinner of living men.\n\nSo led the War-leader his ordered ranks, till at last over the\ntangled crowd of runaways he saw the banners of the Burg and the Face\nflashing against the sun, and heard the roar of the kindreds as they\ndrave the chase towards them.  Then he lifted up his sword, and stood\nstill, and all the host behind him stayed and cast a huge shout up to\nthe heavens, and there they abode the coming of the other Dalesmen.\n\nBut the War-leader sent a message to Hound-under-Greenbury, bidding\nhim lead the Shepherds to the chase of the Dusky Men, who were now\nall fleeing toward the northern outgate of the Market.  Howbeit he\ncalled to mind the throng he had seen on the northern road before\nthey were come into the Market-stead, and deemed that way also death\nawaited the foemen, even if the men of the kindreds forbore them.\n\nBut presently the space betwixt the Woodlanders and the men of the\nFace was clear of all but the dead, so that friend saw the face of\nfriend; and it could be seen that the warriors of the Face were ruddy\nand smiling for joy, because the battle had been easy to them, and\nbut few of them had fallen; for the Dusky Men who had left the\nMarket-stead to fall on them, had had room for fleeing behind them,\nand had speedily turned their backs before the spear-casting of the\nmen of the Face and the onrush of the swordsmen.\n\nThere then stood these victorious men facing one another, and the\nbanner-bearers on either side came through the throng, and brought\nthe banners together between the two hosts; and the Wolf kissed the\nFace, and the Sickle and the Vine met the Steer and the Bridge and\nthe Bull:  but the Shepherds were yet chasing the fleers.\n\nThere in the forefront stood Hall-face the tall, with the joy of\nbattle in his eyes.  And Stone-face, the wise carle in war, stood\nsolemn and stark beside him; and there was the goodly body and the\nfair and kindly visage of the Alderman smiling on the faces of his\nfriends.  But as for Folk-might, his face was yet white and aweful\nwith anger, and he looked restlessly up and down the front of the\nkindreds, though he spake no word.\n\nThen Face-of-god could no longer forbear, but he thrust Dale-warden\ninto his sheath, and ran forward and cast his arms about his father's\nneck and kissed him; and the blood of himself and of the foemen was\non him, for he had been hurt in divers places, but not sorely,\nbecause of the good hammer-work of the Alderman.\n\nThen he kissed his brother and Stone-face, and he took Folk-might by\nthe hand, and was on the point of speaking some word to him, when the\nranks of the Face opened, and lo! the Sun-beam in her bright war-\ngear, and the sword girt to her side, and she unhurt and unsullied.\n\nThen was it to him as when he met her first in Shadowy Vale, and he\nthought of little else than her; but she stepped lightly up to him,\nand unashamed before the whole host she kissed him on the mouth, and\nhe cast his mailed arms about her, and joy made him forget many\nthings and what was next to do, though even at that moment came\nafresh a great clamour of shrieks and cries from the northern outgate\nof the Market-stead:  and the burning pile behind them cast a great\nwavering flame into the air, contending with the bright sun of that\nfair day, now come hard on noontide.  But ere he drew away his face\nfrom the Sun-beam's, came memory to him, and a sharp pang shot\nthrough his heart, as he heard Folk-might say:  'Where then is the\nShield-may of Burgstead? where is the Bride?'\n\nAnd Face-of-god said under his breath:  'She is dead, she is dead!'\nAnd then he stared out straight before him and waited till someone\nelse should say it aloud.  But Bow-may stepped forward and said:\n'Chief of the Wolf, be of good cheer; our kinswoman is hurt, but not\ndeadly.'\n\nThe Alderman's face changed, and he said:  'Hast thou seen her, Bow-\nmay?'\n\n'Nay,' she said.  'How should I leave the battle? but others have\ntold me who have seen her.'\n\nFolk-might stared into the ranks of men before him, but said nothing.\nSaid the Alderman:  'Is she well tended?'\n\n'Yea, surely,' said Bow-may, 'since she is amongst friends, and there\nare no foemen behind us.'\n\nThen came a voice from Folk-might which said:  'Now were it best to\nsend good men and deft in arms, and who know Silver-dale, from house\nto house, to search for foemen who may be lurking there.'\n\nThe Alderman looked kindly and sadly on him and said:\n\n'Kinsman Stone-face, and Hall-face my son, the brunt of the battle is\nnow over, and I am but a simple man amongst you; therefore, if ye\nwill give me leave, I will go see this poor kinswoman of ours, and\ncomfort her.'\n\nThey bade him go:  so he sheathed his sword, and went through the\npress with two men of the Steer toward the southern road; for the\nBride had been brought into a house nigh the corner of the Market-\nplace.\n\nBut Face-of-god looked after his father as he went, and remembrance\nof past days came upon him, and such a storm of grief swept over him,\nas he thought of the Bride lying pale and bleeding and brought anigh\nto her death, that he put his hands to his face and wept as a child\nthat will not be comforted; nor had he any shame of all those\nbystanders, who in sooth were men good and kindly, and had no shame\nof his grief or marvelled at it, for indeed their own hearts were\nsore for their lovely kinswoman, and many of them also wept with\nFace-of-god.  But the Sun-beam stood by and looked on her betrothed,\nand she thought many things of the Bride, and was sorry, albeit no\ntears came into her eyes; then she looked askance at Folk-might and\ntrembled; but he said coldly, and in a loud voice:\n\n'Needs must we search the houses for the lurking felons, or many a\nman will yet be murdered.  Let Wood-wicked lead a band of men at once\nfrom house to house.'\n\nThen said a man of the Wolf hight Hardgrip:  'Wood-wicked was slain\nbetwixt the bent and the houses.'\n\nSaid Folk-might:  'Let it be Wood-wise then.'\n\nBut Bow-may said:  'Wood-wise is even now hurt in the leg by a\nwounded felon, and may not go afoot.'\n\nThen said Folk-might:  'Is Crow the Shaft-speeder anigh?'\n\n'Yea, here am I,' quoth a tall man of fifty winters, coming from out\nthe ranks where stood the Wolves.\n\nSaid Folk-might:  'Kinsman Crow, do thou take two score and ten of\ndoughty men who are not too hot-headed, and search every house about\nthe Market-place; but if ye come on any house that makes a stout\ndefence, send ye word thereof to the Mote-house, where we will\npresently be, and we shall send you help.  Slay every felon that ye\nfall in with; but if ye find in the houses any of the poor folk\ncrouching and afraid, comfort their hearts all ye may, and tell them\nthat now is life come to them.'\n\nSo Crow fell to getting his band together, and presently departed\nwith them on his errand.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII.  THE KINDREDS WIN THE MOTE-HOUSE\n\n\n\nThe din and tumult still came from the north side of the Market-\nplace, so that all the air was full of noise; and Face-of-god deemed\nthat the thralls had gotten weapons into their hands and were slaying\ntheir masters.\n\nNow he lifted up his face, and put his hand on Folk-might's shoulder,\nand said in a loud voice:\n\n'Kinsmen, it were well if our brother were to bid the banners into\nthe Mote-house of the Wolf, and let all the Host set itself in array\nbefore the said house, and abide till the chasers of the foe come to\nus thither; for I perceive that they are now become many, and are\nmore than those of our kindred.'\n\nThen Folk-might looked at him with kind eyes, and said:\n\n'Thou sayest well, brother; even so let it be!'\n\nAnd he lifted up his sword, and Face-of-god cried out in a loud\nvoice:  'Forward, banners! blow up horns! fare we forth with\nvictory!'\n\nSo the Host drew its ranks together in good order, and they all set\nforward, and old Stone-face took the Sun-beam by the hand and led on\nbehind Folk-might and the War-leader.  But when they came to the\nHall, then saw they how the steps that led up to the door were high\nand double, going up from each side without any railing or fool-\nguard; and crowding the stairs and the platform thereof was a band of\nthe Dusky Men, as many as could stand thereon, who shot arrows at the\nhost of the kindreds, howling like dogs, and chattering like apes;\nand arrows and spears came from the windows of the Hall; yea, and on\nthe very roof a score of these felons were riding the ridge and\nmocking like the trolls of old days.\n\nNow when they saw this they stayed a while, and men shielded them\nagainst the shafts; but the leaders drew together in front of the\nHost, and Folk-might fell to speech; and his face was very pale and\nstern; for now he had had time to think of the case of the Bride, and\nfierce wrath, and grief unholpen filled his soul.  So he said:\n\n'Brothers, this is my business to deal with; for I see before me the\nstair that leadeth to the Mote-house of my people, and now would I\nsit there whereas my fathers sat, when peace was on the Dale, as once\nmore it shall be to-morrow.  Therefore up this stair will I go, and\nnone shall hinder me; and let no man of the host follow me till I\nhave entered into the Hall, unless perchance I fall dead by the way;\nbut stand ye still and look on.'\n\n'Nay,' said Face-of-god, 'this is partly the business of the War-\nleader.  There are two stairs.  Be content to take the southern one,\nand I will take the northern.  We shall meet on the plain stone at\nthe top.'\n\nBut Hall-face said:  'War-leader, may I speak?'\n\n'Speak, brother,' said Face-of-god.\n\nSaid Hall-face:  'I have done but little to-day, War-leader.  I would\nstand by thee on the northern stair; so shall Folk-might be content,\nif he doeth two men's work who are not little-hearted.'\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'The doom of the War-leader is that Folk-might\nshall fall on by the southern stair to slake his grief and increase\nhis glory, and Face-of-god and Hall-face by the northern.  Haste to\nthe work, O brothers!'\n\nAnd he and Hall-face went to their places, while all looked on.  But\nthe Sun-beam, with her hand still in Stone-face's, she turned white\nto the lips, and stared with wild eyes before her, not knowing where\nshe was; for she had deemed that the battle was over, and Face-of-god\nsaved from it.\n\nBut Folk-might tossed up his head and laughed, and cried out, 'At\nlast, at last!'  And his sword was in his hand, the Sleep-thorn to\nwit, a blade of ancient fame; so now he let it fall and hang to his\nwrist by the leash, while he clapped his hands together and uttered\nthe Wolf-whoop mightily, and all the men of the Wolf that were in the\nhost, and the Woodlanders withal, uttered it with him.  Then he put\nhis shield over his head and stood before the first of the steps, and\nthe Dusky Men laughed to see one man come against them, though there\nwas death in their hearts.  But he laughed back at them in triumph,\nand set his foot on the step, and let Sleep-thorn's point go into the\nthroat of a Dusky lord, and thrust amongst them, hewing right and\nleft, and tumbling men over the edge of the stair, which was to them\nas the narrow path along the cliff-side that hangeth over the\nunfathomed sea.  They hewed and thrust at him in turn; but so close\nwere they packed that their weapons crossed about him, and one\nshielded him from the other, and they swayed staggering on that\nfearful verge, while the Sleep-thorn crept here and there amongst\nthem, lulling their hot fury.  For, as desperate as they were, and\nfighting for death and not for life, they had a horror of him and of\nthe sea of hatred below them, and feared where to set their feet, and\nhe feared nought at all, but from feet to sword-point was but an\nengine of slaughter, while the heart within him throbbed with fury\nlong held back as he thought upon the Bride and her wounding, and all\nthe wrongs of his people since their Great Undoing.\n\nSo he smote and thrust, till him-seemed the throng of foes thinned\nbefore him:  with his sword-pommel he smote a lord of the Dusky Ones\nin the face, so that he fell over the edge amongst the spears of the\nkindred; then he thrust the point of Sleep-thorn towards the Hall-\ndoor through the breast of another, and then it seemed to him that he\nhad but one before him; so he hove up the edges to cleave him down,\nbut ere the stroke fell, close to his ears exceeding loud rang out\nthe cry, 'For the Burg and the Face! for the Face, for the Face!' and\nhe drew aback a little, and his eyes cleared, and lo! it was Hall-\nface the tall, his long sword all reddened with battle; and beside\nhim stood Face-of-god, silent and panting, his face pale with the\nfierce anger of the fight, and the weariness which was now at last\ngaining upon him.  There stood those three with no other living man\nupon the plain of the stairs.\n\nThen Face-of-god turned shouting to the Folk, and cried:\n\n'Forth now with the banners!  For now is the Wolf come home.  On into\nthe Hall, O Kindred of the Gods!'\n\nThen poured the Folk up over the stairs and into the Hall of the\nWolf, the banners flapping over their heads; and first went the War-\nleader and Folk-might and Hall-face, and then the three delivered\nthralls, Wolf-stone, God-swain, and Spear-fist, and Dallach with\nthem, though both he and Wolf-stone had been hurt in the battle; and\nthen came blended together the Men of the Face along with them of the\nWolf who had entered the Market-stead with them, and with these were\nStone-face and Wood-wont and Bow-may, leading the Sun-beam betwixt\nthem; and now was she come to herself again, though her face was yet\npale, and her eyes gleamed as she stepped across the threshold of the\nHall.\n\nBut when a many were gotten in, and the first-comers had had time to\nhandle their weapons and look about them, a cry of the utmost wrath\nbroke from Folk-might and those others who remembered the Hall from\nof old.  For wretched and befouled was that well-builded house:  the\nhangings rent away; the goodly painted walls daubed and smeared with\nwicked tokens of the Alien murderers:  the floor, once bright with\npolished stones of the mountain, and strewn with sweet-smelling\nflowers, was now as foul as the den of the man-devouring troll of the\nheaths.  From the fair-carven roof of oak and chestnut-beams hung\nugly knots of rags and shapeless images of the sorcery of the Dusky\nMen.  And furthermore, and above all, from the last tie-beam of the\nroof over the dais dangled four shapes of men-at-arms, whom the older\nmen of the Wolf knew at once for the embalmed bodies of their four\ngreat chieftains, who had been slain on the day of the Great Undoing;\nand they cried out with horror and rage as they saw them hanging\nthere in their weapons as they had lived.\n\nThere was the Hostage of the Earth, his shield painted with the green\nworld circled with the worm of the sea.  There was the older Folk-\nmight, the uncle of the living man, bearing a shield with an oak and\na lion done thereon.  There was Wealth-eker, on whose shield was done\na golden sheaf of wheat.  There was he who bore a name great from of\nold, Folk-wolf to wit, bearing on his shield the axe of the hewer.\nThere they hung, dusty, befouled, with sightless eyes and grinning\nmouths, in the dimmed sunlight of the Hall, before the eyes of that\nvictorious Host, stricken silent at the sight of them.\n\nUnderneath them on the dais stood the last remnant of the battle of\nthe Dusky Men; and they, as men mad with coming death, shook their\nweapons, and with shrieking laughter mocked at the overcomers, and\npointed to the long-dead chiefs, and called on them in the tongue of\nthe kindreds to come down and lead their dear kinsmen to the high-\nseat; and then they cried out to the living warriors of the Wolf, and\nbade them better their deed of slaying, and set to work to make alive\nagain, and cause their kinsmen to live merry on the earth.\n\nWith that last mock they handled their weapons and rushed howling on\nthe warriors to meet their death; nor was it long denied them; for\nthe sword of the Wolf, the axe of the Woodland, and the spear of the\nDale soon made an end of the dreadful lives of these destroyers of\nthe Folks.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII.  MEN SING IN THE MOTE-HOUSE\n\n\n\nThen strode the Warriors of the Wolf over the bodies of the slain on\nto the dais of their own Hall; and Folk-might led the Sun-beam by the\nhand, and now was his sword in its sheath, and his face was grown\ncalm, though it was stern and sad.  But even as he trod the dais\ncomes a slim swain of the Wolves twisting himself through the throng,\nand so maketh way to Folk-might, and saith to him:\n\n'Chieftain, the Alderman of Burgdale sendeth me hither to say a word\nto thee; even this, which I am to tell to thee and the War-leader\nboth:  It is most true that our kinswoman the Bride will not die, but\nlive.  So help me, the Warrior and the Face!  This is the word of the\nAlderman.'\n\nWhen Folk-might heard this, his face changed and he hung his head;\nand Face-of-god, who was standing close by, beheld him and deemed\nthat tears were falling from his eyes on to the hall-floor.  As for\nhim, he grew exceeding glad, and he turned to the Sun-beam and met\nher eyes, and saw that she could scarce refrain her longing for him;\nand he was abashed for the sweetness of his love.  But she drew close\nup to him, and spake to him softly and said:\n\n'This is the day that maketh amends; and yet I long for another day.\nWhen I saw thee coming to me that first day in Shadowy Vale, I\nthought thee so goodly a warrior that my heart was in my mouth.  But\nnow how goodly thou art!  For the battle is over, and we shall live.'\n\n'Yea,' said Face-of-god, 'and none shall begrudge us our love.\nBehold thy brother, the hard-heart, the warrior; he weepeth because\nhe hath heard that the Bride shall live.  Be sure then that she shall\nnot gainsay him.  O fair shall the world be to-morrow!'\n\nBut she said:  'O Gold-mane, I have no words.  Is there no minstrelsy\namongst us?'\n\nNow by this time were many of the men of the Wolf and the Woodlanders\ngathered on the dais of the Hall; and the Dalesmen noting this, and\nwotting that these men were now in their own Mote-house, withdrew\nthem as they might for the press toward the nether end thereof.  That\nthe Sun-beam noted, and that all those about her save the War-leader\nwere of the kindreds of the Wolf and the Woodland, and, still\nspeaking softly, she said to Face-of-god:\n\n'Gold-mane, meseemeth I am now in my wrong place; for now the Wolf\nraiseth up his head, but I am departing from him.  Surely I should\nnow be standing amongst my people of the Face, whereto I am going ere\nlong.'\n\nHe said:  'Beloved, I am now become thy kindred and thine home, and\nit is meet for thee to stand beside me.'\n\nShe cast her eyes adown and answered not; and she fell a-pondering of\nhow sorely she had desired that fair dale, and now she would leave\nit, and be content and more than content.\n\nBut now the kindreds had sundered, they upon the dais ranked\nthemselves together there in the House which their fathers had\nbuilded; and when they saw themselves so meetly ordered, their hearts\nbeing full with the sweetness of hope accomplished and the joy of\ndeliverance from death, song arose amongst them, and they fell to\nsinging together; and this is somewhat of their singing:\n\n\n   Now raise we the lay\n   Of the long-coming day!\n   Bright, white was the sun\n   When we saw it begun:\n   O'er its noon now we live;\n   It hath ceased not to give;\n   It shall give, and give more\n   From the wealth of its store.\nO fair was the yesterday!  Kindly and good\nWas the wasteland our guester, and kind was the wood;\nThough below us for reaping lay under our hand\nThe harvest of weeping, the grief of the land;\nDumb cowered the sorrow, nought daring to cry\nOn the help of to-morrow, the deed drawing nigh.\n\n   All increase throve\n   In the Dale of our love;\n   There the ox and the steed\n   Fed down the mead;\n   The grapes hung high\n   'Twixt earth and sky,\n   And the apples fell\n   Round the orchard well.\nYet drear was the land there, and all was for nought;\nNone put forth a hand there for what the year wrought,\nAnd raised it o'erflowing with gifts of the earth.\nFor man's grief was growing beside of the mirth\nOf the springs and the summers that wasted their wealth;\nAnd the birds, the new-comers, made merry by stealth.\n\n   Yet here of old\n   Abode the bold;\n   Nor had they wailed\n   Though the wheat had failed,\n   And the vine no more\n   Gave forth her store.\n   Yea, they found the waste good\n   For the fearless of mood.\nThen to these, that were dwelling aloof from the Dale,\nFared the wild-wind a-telling the worst of the tale;\nAs men bathed in the morning they saw in the pool\nThe image of scorning, the throne of the fool.\nThe picture was gleaming in helm and in sword,\nAnd shone forth its seeming from cups of the board.\n\n   Forth then they came\n   With the battle-flame;\n   From the Wood and the Waste\n   And the Dale did they haste:\n   They saw the storm rise,\n   And with untroubled eyes\n   The war-storm they met;\n   And the rain ruddy-wet.\nO'er the Dale then was litten the Candle of Day,\nNight-sorrow was smitten, and gloom fled away.\nHow the grief-shackles sunder!  How many to morn\nShall awaken and wonder how gladness was born!\nO wont unto sorrow, how sweet unto you\nShall be pondering to-morrow what deed is to do!\n\n   Fell many a man\n   'Neath the edges wan,\n   In the heat of the play\n   That fashioned the day.\n   Praise all ye then\n   The death of men,\n   And the gift of the aid\n   Of the unafraid!\nO strong are the living men mighty to save,\nAnd good is their giving, and gifts that we have!\nBut the dead, they that gave us once, never again;\nLong and long shall they save us sore trouble and pain.\nO Banner above us, O God of the strong,\nLove them as ye love us that bore down our wrong!\n\n\nSo they sang in the Hall; and there was many a man wept, as the song\nended, for those that should never see the good days of the Dale, and\nall the joy that was to be; and men swore, by all that they loved,\nthat they would never forget those that had fallen in the Winning of\nSilver-dale; and that when each year the Cups of Memory went round,\nthey should be no mere names to them, but the very men whom they had\nknown and loved.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX.  DALLACH FARETH TO ROSE-DALE:  CROW TELLETH OF HIS\nERRAND:  THE KINDREDS EAT THEIR MEAT IN SILVER-DALE\n\n\n\nNow Dallach, who had gone away for a while, came back again into the\nHall; and at his back were a half score of men who bore ladders with\nthem:  they were stout men, clad in scanty and ragged raiment, but\ngirt with swords and bearing axes, those of them who were not\nhandling the ladders.  Men looked on them curiously, because they saw\nthem to be of the roughest of the thralls.  They were sullen and\nfierce-eyed to behold, and their hands and bare arms were flecked\nwith blood; and it was easy to see that they had been chasing the\nfleers, and making them pay for their many torments of past days.\n\nBut when Face-of-god beheld this he cried out:  'Ho, Dallach! is it\nso that thou hast bethought thee to bring in hither men to fall to\nthe cleansing of the Hall, and to do away the defiling of the Dusky\nMen?'\n\n'Even so, War-leader,' said Dallach; 'also ye shall know that all\nbattle is over in Silver-stead; for the thralls fell in numbers not\nto be endured on the Dusky Men who had turned their backs to us, and\nhindered them from fleeing north.  But though they have slain many,\nthey have not slain all, and the remnant have fled by divers ways\nwestaway, that they may gain the wood and the ways to Rose-dale; and\nthe stoutest of the thralls are at their heels, and ever as they go\nfresh men from the fields join in the chase with great joy.  I have\ngathered together of the best of them two hundreds and a half well-\narmed; and if thou wilt give me leave, I will get to me yet more, and\nfollow hard on the fleers, and so get me home to Rose-dale; for\nthither will these runaways to meet whatso of their kind may be left\nthere.  Also I would fain be there to set some order amongst the poor\nfolk of mine own people, whom this day's work hath delivered from\ntorment.  And if thou wilt suffer a few men of the Dalesmen to come\nalong with me, then shall all things be better done there.'\n\n'Luck go with thine hands!' said Face-of-god.  'Take whomso thou wilt\nof the Burgdalers that have a mind to fare with thee to the number of\nfive score; and send word of thy thriving to Folk-might, the\nchieftain of the Dale; as for us, meseemeth that we shall abide here\nno long while.  How sayest thou, Folk-might, shall Dallach go?'\n\nThen Folk-might, who stood close beside him, looked up and reddened\nsomewhat, as a man caught heedless when he should be heedful; but he\nlooked kindly on Face-of-god, and said:\n\n'War-leader, so long as thou art in the Dale which ye kindreds have\nwon back for us, thou art the chieftain, and no other, and I bid thee\ndo as thou wilt in this matter, and in all things; and I hereby give\ncommand to all my kindred to do according to thy will everywhere and\nalways, as they love me; and indeed I deem that thy will shall be\ntheirs; since it is only fools who know not their well-wishers.  How\nsay ye, kinsmen?'\n\nThen those about cried out:  'Hail to Face-of-god!  Hail to the\nDalesmen!  Hail to our friends!'\n\nBut Folk-might went up to Face-of-god, and threw his arms about him\nand kissed him, and he said therewithal, so that most men heard him:\n\n'Herewith I kiss not only thee, thou goodly and glorious warrior! but\nthis kiss and embrace is for all the men of the kindreds of the Dale\nand the Shepherds; since I deem that never have men more valiant\ndwelt upon the earth.'\n\nTherewith all men shouted for joy of him, and were exceeding glad;\nbut Folk-might spake apart to Face-of-god and said:\n\n'Brother, I suppose that thou wilt deem it good to abide in this Hall\nor anigh it; for hereabouts now is the heart of the Host.  But as for\nme, I would have leave to depart for a little; since I have an\nerrand, whereof thou mayest wot.'\n\nThen Face-of-god smiled on him, and said:  'Go, and all good go with\nthee; and tell my father that I would have tidings, since I may not\nbe there.'  So he spake; yet in his heart was he glad that he might\nnot go to behold the Bride lying sick and sorry.  But Folk-might\ndeparted without more words; and in the door of the Hall he met Crow\nthe Shaft-speeder, who would have spoken to him, and given him the\ntidings; but Folk-might said to him:  'Do thine errand to the War-\nleader, who is within the Hall.'  And so went on his way.\n\nThen came Crow up the Hall, and stood before Face-of-god and said:\n'War-leader, we have done that which was to be done, and have cleared\nall the houses about the Market-stead.  Moreover, by the rede of\nDallach we have set certain men of the poor folk of the Dale, who are\nwell looked to by the others, to the burying of the slain felons; and\nthey be digging trenches in the fields on the north side of the\nMarket-stead, and carry the carcasses thither as they may.  But the\nslain whom they find of the kindreds do they array out yonder before\nthis Hall.  In all wise are these men tame and biddable, save that\nthey rage against the Dusky Men, though they fear them yet.  As for\nus, they deem us Gods come down from heaven to help them.  So much\nfor what is good:  now have I an ill word to say; to wit, that in the\nhouses whereas we have found many thralls alive, yet also have we\nfound many dead; for amongst these murder-carles were some of an evil\nsort, who, when they saw that the battle would go against them,\nrushed into the houses hewing down all before them--man, woman, and\nchild; so that many of the halls and chambers we saw running blood\nlike to shambles.  To be short:  of them whom they were going to hew\nto the Gods, we have found thirteen living and three dead, of which\nlatter is one woman; and of the living, seven women; and all these,\nliving and dead, with the leaden shackles yet on them wherein they\nshould be burned.  To all these and others whom we have found, we\nhave done what of service we could in the way of victual and clothes,\nso that they scarce believe that they are on this lower earth.\nMoreover, I have with me two score of them, who are men of some wits,\nand who know of the stores of victual and other wares which the\nfelons had, and these will fetch and carry for you as much as ye\nwill.  Is all done rightly, War-leader?'\n\n'Right well,' said Face-of-god, 'and we give thee our thanks\ntherefor.  And now it were well if these thy folk were to dight our\ndinner for us in some green field the nighest that may be, and\nthither shall all the Host be bidden by sound of horn.  Meantime, let\nus void this Hall till it be cleansed of the filth of the Dusky Ones;\nbut hereafter shall we come again to it, and light a fire on the Holy\nHearth, and bid the Gods and the Fathers come back and behold their\nchildren sitting glad in the ancient Hall.'\n\nThen men shouted and were exceeding joyous; but Face-of-god said once\nmore:  'Bear ye a bench out into the Market-place over against the\ndoor of this Hall:  thereon will I sit with other chieftains of the\nkindreds, that whoso will may have recourse to us.'\n\nSo therewith all the men of the kindreds made their ways out of the\nHall and into the Market-stead, which was by this time much cleared\nof the slaughtered felons; and the bale for the burnt-offering was\nnow but smouldering, and a thin column of blue smoke was going up\nwavering amidst the light airs of the afternoon.  Men were somewhat\nsilent now; for they were stiff and weary with the morning's battle;\nand a many had been hurt withal; and on many there yet rested the\nafter-grief of battle, and sorrow for the loss of friends and well-\nwishers.\n\nFor in the battle had fallen one long hundred and two of the men of\nthe Host; and of these were two score and five of the kindreds of the\nSteer, the Bull, and the Bridge, who had made such valiant onslaught\nby the southern road.  Of the Shepherds died one score save three;\nfor though they scattered the foe at once, yet they fell on with such\nheadlong valour, rather than wisely, that many were trapped in the\nthrong of the Dusky Men.  Of the Woodlanders were slain one score and\nnine; for hard had been the fight about them, and no man of them\nspared himself one whit.  Of the men of the Wolf, who were but a few,\nfell sixteen men, and all save two of these in Face-of-god's battle.\nOf the Burgdale men whom Folk-might led, to wit, them of the Face,\nthe Vine, and the Sickle, were but seven men slain outright.  In this\ntale are told all those who died of their hurts after the day of\nbattle.  Therewithal many others were sorely hurt who mended, and\nwent about afterwards hale and hearty.\n\nSo as the folk abode in the Market-place, somewhat faint and weary,\nthey heard horns blow up merrily, and Crow the Shaft-speeder came\nforth and stood on the mound of the altar, and bade men fare to\ndinner, and therewith he led the way, bearing in his hand the banner\nof the Golden Bushel, of which House he was; and they followed him\ninto a fair and great mead on the southwest of Silver-stead,\nbesprinkled about with ancient trees of sweet chestnut.  There they\nfound the boards spread for them with the best of victual which the\npoor down-trodden folk knew how to dight for them; and especially was\nthere great plenty of good wine of the sun-smitten bents.\n\nSo they fell to their meat, and the poor folk, both men and women,\nserved them gladly, though they were somewhat afeard of these fierce\nsword-wielders, the Gods who had delivered them.  The said thralls\nwere mostly not of those who had fallen so bitterly on their fleeing\nmasters, but were men and women of the households, not so roughly\ntreated as the others, that is to say, those who had been wont to\ntoil under the lash in the fields and the silver-mines, and were as\nwild as they durst be.\n\nAs for these waiting-thralls, the men of the kindreds were gentle and\nblithe with them, and often as they served them would they stay their\nhands (and especially if they were women), and would draw down their\nheads to put a morsel in their mouths, or set the wine-cup to their\nlips; and they would stroke them and caress them, and treat them in\nall wise as their dear friends.  Moreover, when any man was full, he\nwould arise and take hold of one of the thralls, and set him in his\nplace, and serve him with meat and drink, and talk with him kindly,\nso that the poor folk were much bewildered with joy.  And the first\nthat arose from table were the Sun-beam and Bow-may and Hall-face,\nwith many of the swains and the women of the Woodlanders; and they\nwent from table to table serving the others.\n\nThe Sun-beam had done off her armour, and went about exceeding fair\nand lovely in her kirtle; but Bow-may yet bore her hauberk, for she\nloved it, and indeed it was so fine and well-wrought that it was no\ngreat burden.  Albeit she had gone down with the Sun-beam and other\nwomen to a fair stream thereby, and there had they bathed and washed\nthemselves; and Bow-may's hurts, which were not great, had been\nlooked to and bound up afresh, and she had come to table unhelmed,\nwith a wreath of wind-flowers round her head.\n\nThere then they feasted; and their hearts were strengthened by the\nmeat and drink; and if sorrow were blended with their joy, yet were\nthey high-hearted through both joy and sorrow, looking forward to the\ngood days to be in the Dales at the Roots of the Mountains, and the\nlove and fellowship of Folks and of Houses.\n\nBut as for Face-of-god, he went not to the meadow, but abode sitting\non the bench in the Market-place, where were none else now of the\nkindreds save the appointed warders.  They had brought him a morsel\nand a cup of wine, and he had eaten and drunk; and now he sat there\nwith Dale-warden lying sheathed across his knees, and seeming to gaze\non the thralls of Silver-dale busied in carrying away the bodies of\nthe slain felons, after they had stripped them of their raiment and\nweapons.  Yet indeed all this was before his eyes as a picture which\nhe noted not.  Rather he sat pondering many things; wondering at his\nbeing there in Silver-dale in the hour of victory; longing for the\npeace of Burgdale and the bride-chamber of the Sun-beam.  Then went\nhis thought out toward his old playmate lying hurt in Silver-dale;\nand his heart was grieved because of her, yet not for long, though\nhis thought still dwelt on her; since he deemed that she would live\nand presently be happy--and happy thenceforward for many years.  So\npondered Face-of-god in the Market-place of Silver-dale.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.  FOLK-MIGHT SEETH THE BRIDE AND SPEAKETH WITH HER\n\n\n\nNow tells the tale of Folk-might, that he went his ways from the Hall\nto the house where the Bride lay; and the swain who had brought the\nmessage went along with him, and he was proud of walking beside so\nmighty a warrior, and he talked to Folk-might as they went; and the\nsound of his voice was irksome to the chieftain, but he made as\nthough he hearkened.  Yet when they came to the door of the house,\nwhich was just out of the Place on the Southern road (for thereby had\nthe Bride fallen to earth), he could withhold his grief no longer,\nbut turned on the threshold and laid his head on the door-jamb, and\nsobbed and wept till the tears fell down like rain.  And the boy\nstood by wondering, and wishing that Folk-might would forbear\nweeping, but durst not speak to him.\n\nIn a while Folk-might left weeping and went in, and found a fair hall\nsore befouled by the felons, and in the corner on a bed covered with\nfurs the wounded woman; and at first sight he deemed her not so pale\nas he looked to see her, as she lay with her long dark-red hair\nstrewed over the pillow, her head moving about wearily.  A linen\ncloth was thrown over her body, but her arms lay out of it before\nher.  Beside her sat the Alderman, his face sober enough, but not as\none in heavy sorrow; and anigh him was another chair as if someone\nhad but just got up from it.  There was no one else in the hall save\ntwo women of the Woodlanders, one of whom was cooking some potion on\nthe hearth, and another was sweeping the floor anigh of bran or some\nsuch stuff, which had been thrown down to sop up the blood.\n\nSo Folk-might went up to the Bride, sorely dreading the image of\ndeath which she had grown to be, and sorely loving the woman she was\nand would be.\n\nHe knelt down by the bedside, heeding Iron-face little, though he\nnodded friendly to him, and he held his face close to hers; but she\nhad her eyes shut and did not open them till he had been there a\nlittle while; and then they opened and fixed themselves on his\nwithout surprise or change.  Then she lifted her right hand (for it\nwas in her left shoulder and side that she had been hurt) and slowly\nlaid it on his head, and drew his face to hers and kissed it fondly,\nas she both smiled and let the tears run over from her eyes.  Then\nshe spake in a weak voice:\n\n'Thou seest, chieftain and dear friend, that I may not stand by thy\nvictorious side to-day.  And now, though I were fain if thou wouldst\nnever leave me, yet needs must thou go about thy work, since thou art\nbecome the Alderman of the Folk of Silver-dale.  Yea, and even if\nthou wert not to go from me, yet in a manner should I go from thee.\nFor I am grievously hurt, and I know by myself, and also the leeches\nhave told me, that the fever is a-coming on me; so that presently I\nshall not know thee, but may deem thee to be a woman, or a hound, or\nthe very Wolf that is the image of the Father of thy kindred; or\neven, it may be, someone else--that I have played with time agone.'\n\nHer voice faltered and faded out here, and she was silent a while;\nthen she said:\n\n'So depart, kind friend and dear love, bearing this word with thee,\nthat should I die, I call on Iron-face my kinsman to bear witness\nthat I bid thee carry me to bale in Silver-dale, and lay mine ashes\nwith the ashes of thy Fathers, with whom thine own shall mingle at\nthe last, since I have been of the warriors who have helped to bring\nthee aback to the land of thy folk.'\n\nThen she smiled and shut her eyes and said:  'And if I live, as\nindeed I hope, and how glad and glad I shall be to live, then shalt\nthou bring me to thy house and thy bed, that I may not depart from\nthee while both our lives last.'\n\nAnd she opened her eyes and looked at him; and he might not speak for\na while, so ravished as he was betwixt joy and sorrow.  But the\nAlderman arose and took a gold ring from off his arm, and spake:\n\n'This is the gold ring of the God of the Face, and I bear it on mine\narm betwixt the Folk and the God in all man-motes, and I bore it\nthrough the battle to-day; and it is as holy a ring as may be; and\nsince ye are plighting troth, and I am the witness thereof, it were\ngood that ye held this ring together and called the God to witness,\nwho is akin to the God of the Earth, as we all be.  Take the ring,\nFolk-might, for I trust thee; and of all women now alive would I have\nthis woman happy.'\n\nSo Folk-might took the ring and thrust his hand through it, and took\nher hand, and said:\n\n'Ye Fathers, thou God of the Face, thou Earth-god, thou Warrior, bear\nwitness that my life and my body are plighted to this woman, the\nBride of the House of the Steer!'\n\nHis face was flushed and bright as he spoke, but as his words ceased\nhe noted how feebly her hand lay in his, and his face fell, and he\ngazed on her timidly.  But she lay quiet, and said softly and slowly:\n\n'O Fathers of my kindred!  O Warrior and God of the Earth! bear\nwitness that I plight my troth to this man, to lie in his grave if I\ndie, and in his bed if I live.'\n\nAnd she smiled on him again, and then closed her eyes; but opened\nthem presently once more, and said:\n\n'Dear friend, how fared it with Gold-mane to-day?'\n\nSaid Folk-might:  'So well he did, that none might have done better.\nHe fared in the fight as if he had been our Father the Warrior:  he\nis a great chieftain.'\n\nShe said:  'Wilt thou give him this message from me, that in no wise\nhe forget the oath which he swore upon the finger-ring as it lay on\nthe sundial of the Garden of the Face?  And say, moreover, that I am\nsorry that we shall part, and have between us such breadth of wild-\nwood and mountain-neck.'\n\n'Yea, surely will I give thy message,' said Folk-might; and in his\nheart he rejoiced, because he heard her speak as if she were sure of\nlife.  Then she said faintly:\n\n'It is now thy work to depart from me, and to do as it behoveth a\nchieftain of the people and the Alderman of Silver-dale.  Depart,\nlest the leeches chide me:  farewell, my dear!'\n\nSo he laid his face to hers and kissed her, and rose up and embraced\nIron-face, and went his ways without looking back.\n\nBut just over the threshold he met old Hall-ward of the House of the\nSteer, who was at point to enter, and he greeted him kindly.  The old\nman looked on him steadily, and said:  'To-morrow or the day after I\nwill utter a word to thee, O Chief of the Wolf.'\n\n'In a good hour,' said Folk-might, 'for all thy words are true.'\nTherewith he gat him away from the house, and came to Face-of-god,\nwhere he sat before the altar of the Crooked Sword; and now were the\nchiefs come back from their meat, and were sitting with him; there\nalso were Wood-father and Wood-wont; but Bow-may was with the Sun-\nbeam, who was resting softly in the fair meadow after all the\nturmoil.\n\nSo men made place for Folk-might beside the War-leader, who looked\nupon his face, and saw that it was sober and unsmiling, but not heavy\nor moody with grief.  So he deemed that all was as well as it might\nbe with the Bride, and with a good heart fell to taking counsel with\nthe others; and kindly and friendly were the redes which they held\nthere, with no gainsaying of man by man, for the whole folk was glad\nat heart.\n\nSo there they ordered all matters duly for that present time, and by\nthen they had made an end, it was past sunset, and men were lodged in\nthe chief houses about the Market-stead.\n\nAlbeit, though they ate their meat with all joy of heart, and were\nmerry in converse one with the other, the men of the Wolf would by no\nmeans feast in their Hall again till it had been cleansed and\nhallowed anew.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.  THE DEAD BORNE TO BALE:  THE MOTE-HOUSE RE-HALLOWED\n\n\n\nOn the morrow they bore to bale their slain men, and there withal\nwhat was left of the bodies of the four chieftains of the Great\nUndoing.  They brought them into a most fair meadow to the west of\nSilver-stead, where they had piled up a very great bale for the\nburning.  In that meadow was the Doom-ring and Thing-stead of the\nFolk of the Wolf, and they had hallowed it when they had first\nconquered Silver-dale, and it was deemed far holier than the Mote-\nhouse aforesaid, wherein the men of the kindred might hold no due\ncourt; but rather it was a Feast-hall, and a house where men had\nconverse together, and wherein precious things and tokens of the\nFathers were stored up.\n\nThe Thing-stead in the meadow was flowery and well-grassed, and a\nlittle stream winding about thereby nearly cast a ring around it; and\nbeyond the stream was a full fair grove of oak-trees, very tall and\nancient.  There then they burned the dead of the Host, wrapped about\nin exceeding fair raiment.  And when the ashes were gathered, the men\nof Burgdale and the Shepherds left those of their folk for the\nkindred to bury there in Silver-dale; for they said that they had a\nright to claim such guesting for them that had helped to win back the\nDale.\n\nBut when the Burning was done and the bale quenched, and the ashes\ngathered and buried (and that was on the morrow), then men bore forth\nthe Banners of the Jaws of the Wolf, and the Red Hand, and the Silver\nArm, and the Golden Bushel, and the Ragged Sword, and the Wolf of the\nWoodland; and with great joy and triumph they brought them into the\nMote-house and hung them up over the dais; and they kindled fire on\nthe Holy Hearth by holding up a disk of bright glass to the sun; and\nthen they sang before the banners.  And this is somewhat of the song\nthat they sang before them:\n\n\nWhy are ye wending?  O whence and whither?\n   What shineth over the fallow swords?\nWhat is the joy that ye bear in hither?\n   What is the tale of your blended words?\n\nNo whither we wend, but here have we stayed us,\n   Here by the ancient Holy Hearth;\nLong have the moons and the years delayed us,\n   But here are we come from the heart of the dearth.\n\nWe are the men of joy belated;\n   We are the wanderers over the waste;\nWe are but they that sat and waited,\n   Watching the empty winds make haste.\n\nLong, long we sat and knew no others,\n   Save alien folk and the foes of the road;\nTill late and at last we met our brothers,\n   And needs must we to the old abode.\n\nFor once on a day they prayed for guesting;\n   And how were we then their bede to do?\nWild was the waste for the people's resting,\n   And deep the wealth of the Dale we knew.\n\nHere were the boards that we must spread them\n   Down in the fruitful Dale and dear;\nHere were the halls where we would bed them:\n   And how should we tarry otherwhere?\n\nOver the waste we came together:\n   There was the tangle athwart the way;\nThere was the wind-storm and the weather;\n   The red rain darkened down the day.\n\nBut that day of the days what grief should let us,\n   When we saw through the clouds the dale-glad sun?\nWe tore at the tangle that beset us,\n   And stood at peace when the day was done.\n\nHall of the Happy, take our greeting!\n   Bid thou the Fathers come and see\nThe Folk-signs on thy walls a-meeting,\n   And deem to-day what men we be.\n\nLook on the Holy Hearth new-litten,\n   How the sparks fly twinkling up aloof!\nHow the wavering smoke by the sunlight smitten,\n   Curls up around the beam-rich roof!\n\nFor here once more is the Wolf abiding,\n   Nor ever more from the Dale shall wend,\nAnd never again his head be hiding,\n   Till all days be dark and the world have end.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII.  OF THE NEW BEGINNING OF GOOD DAYS IN SILVER-DALE\n\n\n\nOn the third day there was high-tide and great joy amongst all men\nfrom end to end of the Dale; and the delivered thralls were feasted\nand made much of by the kindreds, so that they scarce knew how to\nbelieve their own five senses that told them the good tidings.\n\nFor none strove to grieve them and torment them; what they would,\nthat did they, and they had all things plenteously; since for all was\nthere enough and to spare of goods stored up for the Dusky Men, as\ncorn and wine and oil and spices, and raiment and silver.  Horses\nwere there also, and neat and sheep and swine in abundance.  Withal\nthere was the good and dear land; the waxing corn on the acres; the\nblossoming vines on the hillside; and about the orchards and\nalongside the ways, the plum-trees and cherry-trees and pear-trees\nthat had cast their blossom and were overhung with little young\nfruit; and the fair apple-trees a-blossoming, and the chestnuts\nspreading their boughs from their twisted trunks over the green\ngrass.  And there was the goodly pasture for the horses and the neat,\nand the thymy hill-grass for the sheep; and beyond it all, the\nthicket of the great wood, with its unfailing store of goodly timber\nof ash and oak and holly and yoke-elm.  There need no man lack unless\nman compelled him, and all was rich enough and wide enough for the\nwaxing of a very great folk.\n\nNow, therefore, men betook them to what was their own before the\ncoming of the Dusky Men; and though at first many of the delivered\nthrall-folk feasted somewhat above measure, and though there were\nsome of them who were not very brisk at working on the earth for\ntheir livelihood; yet were the most part of them quick of wit and\ndeft of hand, and they mostly fell to presently at their cunning,\nboth of husbandry and handicraft.  Moreover, they had great love of\nthe kindreds, and especially of the Woodlanders, and strove to do all\nthings that might pleasure them.  And as for those who were dull and\nlistless because of their many torments of the last ten years, they\nwould at least fetch and carry willingly for them of the kindreds;\nand these last grudged them not meat and raiment and house-room, even\nif they wrought but little for it, because they called to mind the\nevil days of their thralldom, and bethought them how few are men's\ndays upon the earth.\n\nThus all things throve in Silver-dale, and the days wore on toward\nthe summer, and the Yule-tide rest beyond it, and the years beyond\nand far beyond the winning of Silver-dale.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII.  OF THE WORD WHICH HALL-WARD OF THE STEER HAD FOR FOLK-\nMIGHT\n\n\n\nBut of the time then passing, it is to be said that the whole host\nabode in Silver-dale in great mirth and good liking, till they should\nhear tidings of Dallach and his company, who had followed hot-foot on\nthe fleers of the Dusky Men.  And on the tenth day after the battle,\nIron-face and his two sons and Stone-face were sitting about sunset\nunder a great oak-tree by that stream-side which ran through the\nMote-stead; there also was Folk-might, somewhat distraught because of\nhis love for the Bride, who was now mending of her hurts.  As they\nsat there in all content they saw folk coming toward them, three in\nnumber, and as they drew nigher they saw that it was old Hall-ward of\nthe Steer, and the Sun-beam and Bow-may following him hand in hand.\n\nWhen they came to the brook Bow-may ran up to the elder to help him\nover the stepping-stones; which she did as one who loved him, as the\nold man was stark enough to have waded the water waist-deep.  She was\nno longer in her war-gear, but was clad after her wont of Shadowy\nVale, in nought but a white woollen kirtle.  So she stood in the\nstream beside the stones, and let the swift water ripple up over her\nankles, while the elder leaned on her shoulder and looked down upon\nher kindly.  The Sun-beam followed after them, stepping daintily from\nstone to stone, so that she was a fair sight to see; her face was\nsmiling and happy, and as she stepped forth on to the green grass the\ncolour flushed up in it, but she cast her eyes adown as one somewhat\nshamefaced.\n\nSo the chieftains rose up before the leader of the Steer, and Folk-\nmight went up to him, and greeted him, and took his hand and kissed\nhim on the cheek.  And Hall-ward said:\n\n'Hail to the chiefs of the kindred, and my earthly friends!'\n\nThen Folk-might bade him sit down by him, and all the men sat down\nagain; but the Sun-beam leaned her back against a sapling ash hard\nby, her feet set close together; and Bow-may went to and fro in short\nturns, keeping well within ear-shot.\n\nThen said Hall-ward:  'Folk-might, I have prayed thy kinswoman Bow-\nmay to lead me to thee, that I might speak with thee; and it is good\nthat I find my kinsmen of the Face in thy company; for I would say a\nword to thee that concerns them somewhat.'\n\nSaid Folk-might:  'Guest, and warrior of the Steer, thy words are\never good; and if this time thou comest to ask aught of me, then\nshall they be better than good.'\n\nSaid Hall-ward:  'Tell me, Folk-might, hast thou seen my daughter the\nBride to-day?'\n\n'Yea,' said Folk-might, reddening.\n\n'What didst thou deem of her state?' said Hall-ward.\n\nSaid Folk-might:  'Thou knowest thyself that the fever hath left her,\nand that she is mending.'\n\nHall-ward said:  'In a few days belike we shall be wending home to\nBurgdale:  when deemest thou that the Bride may travel, if it were\nbut on a litter?'\n\nFolk-might was silent, and Hall-ward smiled on him and said:\n\n'Wouldst thou have her tarry, O chief of the Wolf?'\n\n'So it is,' said Folk-might, 'that it might be labour lost for her to\njourney to Burgdale at present.'\n\n'Thinkest thou?' said Hall-ward; 'hast thou a mind then that if she\ngoeth she shall speedily come back hither?'\n\n'It has been in my mind,' said Folk-might, 'that I should wed her.\nWilt thou gainsay it?  I pray thee, Iron-face my friend, and ye\nStone-face and Hall-face, and thou, Face-of-god, my brother, to lay\nthy words to mine in this matter.'\n\nThen said Hall-ward stroking his beard:  'There will be a seat\nmissing in the Hall of the Steer, and a sore lack in the heart of\nmany a man in Burgdale if the Bride come back to us no more.  We\nlooked not to lose the maiden by her wedding; for it is no long way\nbetwixt the House of the Steer and the House of the Face.  But now,\nwhen I arise in the morning and miss her, I shall take my staff and\nwalk down the street of Burgstead; for I shall say, The Maiden hath\ngone to see Iron-face my friend; she is well in the House of the\nFace.  And then shall I remember how that the wood and the wastes lie\nbetween us.  How sayest thou, Alderman?'\n\n'A sore lack it will be,' said Iron-face; 'but all good go with her!\nThough whiles shall I go hatless down Burgstead street, and say, Now\nwill I go fetch my daughter the Bride from the House of the Steer;\nwhile many a day's journey shall lie betwixt us.'\n\nSaid Hall-ward:  'I will not beat about the bush, Folk-might; what\ngift wilt thou give us for the maiden?'\n\nSaid Folk-might:  'Whatever is mine shall be thine; and whatsoever of\nthe Dale the kindred and the poor folk begrudge thee not, that shalt\nthou have; and deemest thou that they will begrudge thee aught?  Is\nit enough?'\n\nHall-ward said:  'I wot not, chieftain; see thou to it!  Bow-may, my\nfriend, bring hither that which I would have from Silver-dale for the\nHouse of the Steer in payment for our maiden.'\n\nThen Bow-may came forward speedily, and went up to the Sun-beam, and\nled her by the hand in front of Folk-might and Hall-ward and the\nother chieftains.  Then Folk-might started, and leapt up from the\nground; for, sooth to say, he had been thinking so wholly of the\nBride, that his sister was not in his mind, and he had had no deeming\nof whither Hall-ward was coming, though the others guessed well\nenough, and now smiled on him merrily, when they saw how wild Folk-\nmight stared.  As for the Sun-beam, she stood there blushing like a\nrose in June, but looking her brother straight in the face, as Hall-\nward said:\n\n'Folk-might, chief of the Wolf, since thou wouldst take our maiden\nthe Bride away from us, I ask thee to make good her place with this\nmaiden; so that the House of the Steer may not lack, when they who\nare wont to wed therein come to us and pray us for a bedfellow for\nthe best of their kindred.'\n\nThen became Folk-might smiling and merry like unto the others, and he\nsaid:  'Chief of the Steer, this gift is thine, together with aught\nelse which thou mayst desire of us.'\n\nThen he kissed the Sun-beam, and said:  'Sister, we looked for this\nto befall in some fashion.  Yet we deemed that he that should lead\nthee away might abide with us for a moon or two.  But now let all\nthis be, since if thou art not to bear children to the kindreds of\nSilver-dale, yet shalt thou bear them to their friends and fellows.\nAnd now choose what gift thou wilt have of us to keep us in thy\nmemory.'\n\nShe said:  'The memory of my people shall not fade from me; yet\nindeed I ask thee for a gift, to wit, Bow-may, and the two sons of\nWood-father that are left since Wood-wicked was slain; and belike the\nelder and his wife will be fain to go with their sons, and ye will\nnot hinder them.'\n\n'Even so shall it be done,' said Folk-might, and he was silent a\nwhile, pondering; and then he said:\n\n'Lo you, friends! doth it not seem strange to you that peace\nsundereth as well as war?  Indeed I deem it grievous that ye shall\nhave to miss your well-beloved kinswoman.  And for me, I am now grown\nso used to this woman my sister, though at whiles she hath been\nmasterful with me, that I shall often turn about and think to speak\nto her, when there lie long days of wood and waste betwixt her voice\nand mine.\n\nThe Sun-beam laughed in his face, though the tears stood in her eyes,\nas she said:  'Keep up thine heart, brother; for at least the way is\nshorter betwixt Burgdale and Silver-dale than betwixt life and death;\nand the road we shall learn belike.'\n\nSaid Hall-face:  'So it is that my brother is no ill woodman, as ye\nlearned last autumn.'\n\nIron-face smiled, but somewhat sadly; for he beheld Face-of-god, who\nhad no eyes for anyone save the Sun-beam; and no marvel was that, for\nnever had she looked fairer.  And forsooth the War-leader was not\nutterly well-pleased; for he was deeming that there would be delaying\nof his wedding, now that the Sun-beam was to become a maid of the\nSteer; and in his mind he half deemed that it would be better if he\nwere to take her by the hand and lead her home through the wild-wood,\nhe and she alone; and she looked on him shyly, as though she had a\ndeeming of his thought.  Albeit he knew it might not be, that he, the\nchosen War-leader, should trouble the peace of the kindred; for he\nwotted that all this was done for peace' sake.\n\nSo Hall-ward stood forth and took the Sun-beam's right hand in his,\nand said:\n\n'Now do I take this maiden, Sun-beam of the kindred of the Wolf, and\nlead her into the House of the Steer, to be in all ways one of the\nmaidens of our House, and to wed in the blood wherein we have been\nwont to wed.  Neither from henceforth let anyone say that this woman\nis not of the blood of the Steer; for we have given her our blood,\nand she is of us duly and truly.'\n\nThereafter they talked together merrily for a little, and then turned\ntoward the houses, for the sun was now down; and as they went Iron-\nface spake to his son, and said:\n\n'Gold-mane, wilt thou verily keep thine oath to wed the fairest woman\nin the world?  By how much is this one fairer than my dear daughter\nwho shall no more dwell in mine house?'\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'Yea, father, I shall keep mine oath; for the\nGods, who know much, know that when I swore last Yule I was thinking\nof the fair woman going yonder beside Hall-ward, and of none other.'\n\n'Ah, son!' said Iron-face, 'why didst thou beguile us?  Hadst thou\nbut told us the truth then!'\n\n'Yea, Alderman,' said Face-of-god smiling, 'and how thou wouldest\nhave raged against me then, when thou hast scarce forgiven me now!\nIn sooth, father, I feared to tell you all:  I was young; I was one\nagainst the world.  Yea, yea; and even that was sweet to me, so\nsorely as I loved her--Hast thou forgotten, father?'\n\nIron-face smiled, and answered not; and so came they to the house\nwherein they were guested.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV.  TIDINGS OF DALLACH:  A FOLK-MOTE IN SILVER-DALE\n\n\n\nThree days thereafter came two swift runners from Rose-dale with\ntidings of Dallach.  In all wise had he thriven, and had slain many\nof the runaways, and had come happily to Rose-dale:  therein by the\nmere shaking of their swords had they all their will; for there were\nbut a few of the Dusky Warriors in the Dale, since the more part had\nfared to the slaughter in Silver-stead.  Now therefore had Dallach\nbeen made Alderman of Rose-dale; and the Burgdalers who had gone with\nhim should abide the coming thither of the rest of the Burgdale Host,\nand meantime of their coming should uphold the new Alderman in Rose-\ndale.  Howbeit Dallach sent word that it was not to be doubted but\nthat many of the Dusky Men had escaped to the woods, and should yet\nbe the death of many a mother's son, unless it were well looked to.\n\nAnd now the more part of the Burgdale men and the Shepherds began to\nlook toward home, albeit some amongst them had not been ill-pleased\nto abide there yet a while; for life was exceeding soft to them\nthere, though they helped the poor folk gladly in their husbandry.\nFor especially the women of the Dale, of whom many were very goodly,\nhankered after the fair-faced tall Burgdalers, and were as kind to\nthem as might be.  Forsooth not a few, both carles and queens, of the\nold thrall-folk prayed them of Burgdale to take them home thither,\nthat they might see new things and forget their old torments once for\nall, yea, even in dreams.  The Burgdalers would not gainsay them, and\nthere was no one else to hinder; so that there went with the Burgdale\nmen at their departure hard on five score of the Silver-dale folk who\nwere not of the kindreds.\n\nAnd now was a great Folk-mote holden in Silver-dale, whereto the\nBurgdale men and the Shepherds were bidden; and thereat the War-\nleader gave out the morrow of the morrow for the day of the departure\nof the Host.  There also were the matters of Silver-dale duly\nordered:  the Men of the Wolf would have had the Woodlanders dwell\nwith them in the fair-builded stead, and take to them of the goodly\nstone houses there what they would; but this they naysaid, choosing\nrather to dwell in scattered houses, which they built for themselves\nat the utmost limit of the tillage.\n\nIndeed, the most abode not even there a long while; for they loved\nthe wood and its deeds.  So they went forth into the wood, and\ncleared them space to dwell in, and builded them halls such as they\nloved, and fell to their old woodland crafts of charcoal-burning and\nhunting, wherein they throve well.  And good for Silver-dale was\ntheir abiding there, since they became a sure defence and stout\noutpost against all foemen.  For the rest, wheresoever they dwelt,\nthey were guest-cherishing and blithe, and were well beloved by all\npeople; and they wedded with the other Houses of the Children of the\nWolf.\n\nAs to the other matters whereof they took rede at this Folk-mote,\nthey had mostly to do with the warding of the Dale, and the learning\nof the delivered thralls to handle weapons duly.  For men deemed it\nmost like that they would have to meet other men of the kindred of\nthe Felons; which indeed fell out as the years wore.\n\nMoreover, Folk-might (by the rede of Stone-face) sent messengers to\nthe Plain and the Cities, unto men whom he knew there, doing them to\nwit of the tidings of Silver-dale, and how that a peaceful and guest-\nloving people, having good store of wares, now dwelt therein, so that\nchapmen might have recourse thither.\n\nLastly spake Folk-might and said:\n\n'Guests and brothers-in-arms, we have been looking about our new\nhouse, which was our old one, and therein we find great store of\nwares which we need not, and which we can but use if ye use them.  Of\nyour kindness therefore we pray you to take of those things what ye\ncan easily carry.  And if ye say the way is long, as indeed it is,\nsince ye are bent on going through the wood to Rose-dale, and so on\nto Burgdale, yet shall we furnish you with beasts to bear your goods,\nand with such wains as may pass through the woodland ways.'\n\nThen rose up Fox of Upton and said:  'O Folk-might, and ye men of the\nWolf, be it known unto you, that if we have done anything for your\nhelp in the winning of Silver-dale, we have thus done that we might\nhelp ourselves also, so that we might live in peace henceforward, and\nthat we might have your friendship and fellowship therewithal, so\nthat here in Silver-dale might wax a mighty folk who joined unto us\nshould be strong enough to face the whole world.  Such are the redes\nof wise men when they go a-warring.  But we have no will to go back\nhome again made rich with your wealth; this hath been far from our\nthought in this matter.'\n\nAnd there went up a murmur from all the Burgdalers yeasaying his\nword.\n\nBut Folk-might took up the word again and spake:\n\n'Men of Burgdale and the Sheepcotes, what ye say is both manly and\nfriendly; yet, since we look to see a road made plain through the\nwoodland betwixt Burgdale and Silver-dale, and that often ye shall\nface us in the feast-hall, and whiles stand beside us in the fray, we\nmust needs pray you not to shame us by departing empty-handed; for\nhow then may we look upon your faces again?  Stone-face, my friend,\nthou art old and wise; therefore I bid thee to help us herein, and\nspeak for us to thy kindred, that they naysay us not in this matter.'\n\nThen stood up Stone-face and said:  'Forsooth, friends, Folk-might is\nin the right herein; for he may look for anger from the wights that\ncome and go betwixt his kindred and the Gods, if they see us faring\nback giftless through the woods.  Moreover, now that ye have seen\nSilver-dale, ye may wot how rich a land it is of all good things, and\nable to bring forth enough and to spare.  And now meseemeth the Gods\nlove this Folk that shall dwell here; and they shall become a mighty\nFolk, and a part of our very selves.  Therefore let us take the gifts\nof our friends, and thank them blithely.  For surely, as saith Folk-\nmight, henceforth the wood shall become a road betwixt us, and the\nthicket a halting-place for friends bearing goodwill in their hands.'\n\nWhen he had spoken, men yeasaid his words and forbore the gifts no\nlonger; and the Folk-mote sundered in all loving-kindness.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV.  DEPARTURE FROM SILVER-DALE\n\n\n\nOn morrow of the morrow were the Burgdale men and they of the\nShepherds gathered together in the Market-stead early in the morning,\nand they were all ready for departure; and the men of the Wolf and\nthe Woodlanders, and of the delivered thralls a great many, stood\nround about them grieving that they must go.  There was much talk\nbetween the folk of the Dale and the Guests, and many promises were\ngiven and taken to come and go betwixt the two Dales.  There also\nwere the men of the thrall-folk who were to wend home with the\nBurgdalers; and they had been stuffed with good things by the men of\nthe kindreds, and were as fain as might be.\n\nAs for the Sun-beam, she was somewhat out of herself at first, being\neager and restless beyond her wont, and yet at whiles weeping-ripe\nwhen she called to mind that she was now leaving all those things,\nthe gain whereof had been a dream to her both waking and sleeping for\nthese years past.  But at last, as she stood in the door of the Mote-\nhouse, and beheld all the throng of folk happy and friendly, it came\nover her that she herself had done her full share to bring all this\nabout, and that all those pleasant places of Silver-dale now full of\nthe goodly life of man would be there even as she had striven for\nthem, and that they would be a part of her left behind, though she\nwere dwelling otherwhere.\n\nTherewithal she said to herself that it was now her part to wield the\nlife of men in Burgdale, and begin once more her days of a chieftain\nand a swayer of the Folk, and the life of a stirring woman, which the\nedge of the sword and the need of the hard hand-play had taken out of\nher hands for a while, making her as a child in the hands of the\nstrong wielders of the blades.\n\nSo now she became calm once more, and her face was clad again with\nthe full measure of that majesty of beauty which had once overawed\nFace-of-god amidst his love of her; and folk beheld her and marvelled\nat her fairness, and said:  'She hath an inward sorrow at leaving the\nfair Dale wherein her Fathers dwelt, and where her mother's ashes lie\nin earth.'  Albeit now was her sorrow but little, and much was her\nhope, and her foresight of days to be; though all the Dale, yea,\nevery leaf and twig of it whereby her feet had ever passed, and each\nstone of the fair houses, was to her as a picture that she could look\non from henceforth for ever.\n\nOf the Bride it is to be said that she was now much mended, and she\ncaused men bear her on a litter out into the Marketplace, that she\nmight look on the departure of her folk.  She had seen Face-of-god\nonce and again since the Day of Battle, and each time had been kind\nand blithe with him; and for Iron-face, she loved him so well that\nshe was ever loth to let him depart from her, save when Folk-might\nwas with her.\n\nAnd now was the Alderman standing beside her, and she said to him:\n'Friend and kinsman, this is the day of departure, and though I must\nneeds abide behind, and am content to abide, yet doth mine heart ache\nwith the sundering; for to-morrow when I wake in the morning there\nwill be no more sending of a messenger to fetch thee to me.  Indeed,\ngreat hath been the love between me and my people, and nought hath\ncome between us to mar it.  Now, kinsman, I would see Gold-mane, my\ncousin, that I may bid him farewell; for who knoweth if I shall see\nhim again hereafter?'\n\nThen went Iron-face and found Face-of-god where he was speaking with\nFolk-might and the chieftains, and said to him:\n\n'Come quickly, for thy cousin the Bride would speak with thee.'\n\nFace-of-god reddened, and paled afterwards, but he went along with\nhis father silently; and his heart beat as he came and stood before\nthe litter whereas the Bride lay, clad all in white and propped up on\nfair cushions of red silk.  She was frail to look on, and worn and\npale yet; but he deemed that she was very happy.\n\nShe smiled on him, and reached out her hand and said:\n\n'Welcome once more, cousin!'  And he held her hand and kissed it, and\nwas nigh weeping, so sore was he beset by a throng of memories\nconcerning her and him in the days when they were little; and he\nbethought him of her loving-kindness of past days, beyond that of\nmost children, beyond that of most maidens; and how there was nothing\nin his life but she had a share in it, till the day when he found the\nHall on the Mountain.\n\nSo he said to her:  'Kinswoman, is it well with thee?'\n\n'Yea,' she said, 'I am now nigh whole of my hurts.'\n\nHe was silent a while; then he said:\n\n'And otherwise art thou merry at heart?'\n\n'Yea, indeed,' said she; 'yet thou wilt not find it hard to deem that\nI am sorry of the sundering betwixt me and Burgdale.'\n\nAgain was he silent, and said in a while:  'Dost thou deem that I\nwrought that sundering?'\n\nShe smiled kindly on him and said:  'Gold-mane, my playmate, thou art\nbecome a mighty warrior and a great chief; but thou art not so mighty\nas that.  Many things lay behind the sundering which were neither\nthou nor I.'\n\n'Yet,' said he, 'it was but such a little time agone that all things\nseemed so sure; and we--to both of us was the outlook happy.'\n\n'Let it be happy still,' she said, 'now begrudging is gone.  Belike\nthe sundering came because we were so sure, and had no defence\nagainst the wearing of the days; even as it fareth with a folk that\nhath no foes.'\n\nHe smiled and said:  'Even as it hath befallen THY folk, O Bride, a\nwhile ago.'\n\nShe reddened, and reached her hand to him, and he took it and held\nit, and said:  'Shall I see thee again as the days wear?'\n\nSaid she:  'O chieftain of the Folk, thou shalt have much to do in\nBurgdale, and the way is long.  Yet would I have thee see my\nchildren.  Forget not the token on my hand which thou holdest.  But\nnow get thee to thy folk with no more words; for after all, playmate,\nthe sundering is grievous to me, and I would not spin out the time\nthereof.  Farewell!'\n\nHe said no more, but stooped down and kissed her lips, and then\nturned from her, and took his ways to the head of the Host, and fell\nto asking and answering, and bidding and arraying; and in a little\ntime was his heart dancing with joy to think of the days that lay\nbefore him, wherein now all seemed happy.\n\nSo was all arrayed for departure when it lacked three hours of noon.\nAs Folk-might had promised, there were certain light wains drawn by\nbullocks abiding the departure of the Host, and of sumpter bullocks\nand horses no few; and all these were laden with fair gifts of the\nDale, as silver, and raiment, and weapons.  There were many things\nfair-wrought in the time of the Sorrow, that henceforth should see\nbut little sorrow.  Moreover, there was plenty of provision for the\nway, both meal and wine, and sheep and neat; and all things as fair\nas might be, and well-arrayed.\n\nIt was the Shepherds who were to lead the way; and after them were\narrayed the men of the Vine and the Sickle; then they of the Steer,\nthe Bridge, and the Bull; and lastly the House of the Face, with old\nStone-face leading them.  The Sun-beam was to journey along with the\nHouse of the Steer, which had taken her in as a maiden of their\nblood; and though she had so much liefer have fared with the House of\nthe Face, yet she went meekly as she was bidden, as one who has\ngotten a great thing, and will make no stir about a small one.\n\nAlong with her were Wood-father and Wood-mother, and Wood-wise, now\nwhole of his hurt, and Wood-wont, and Bow-may.  Save Bow-may, they\nwere not very joyous; for they were fain of Silver-dale, and it irked\nthem to leave it; moreover, they also had liefer have gone along with\nthe House of the War-leader.\n\nLast of all went those people of the once thralls of the Dusky Men\nwho had cast in their lot with the Burgdalers, and they were\nexceeding merry; and especially the women of them, they were\nchattering like the stares in the autumn evening, when they gather\nfrom the fields in the tall elm-trees before they go to roost.\n\nNow all the men of the Dale, both of the kindreds and of the thrall-\nfolk, made way for the Host and its havings, that they might go their\nways down the Dale; albeit the Woodlanders clung close to the line of\ntheir ancient friends, and with them, as men who were sorry for the\nsundering, were Wolf-stone and God-swain and Spear-fist.  But the\nchiefs, they drew around Folk-might a little beside the way.\n\nNow Red-coat of Waterless, who had been hurt, and was now whole\nagain, cast his arms about Folk-might and kissed him, and said:\n\n'All the way hence to Burgdale will I sow with good wishes for thee\nand thine, and especially for my dear friend God-swain of the Silver\nArm; and I would wish and long that they might turn into spells to\ndraw thy feet to usward; for we love thee well.'\n\nIn like wise spake other of the Burgdalers; and Folk-might was kind\nand blithe with them, and he said:\n\n'Friends, forget ye not that the way is no longer from you to us than\nit is from us to you.  One half of this matter it is for you to deal\nwith.'\n\n'True is that,' said Red-beard of the Knolls, 'but look you, Folk-\nmight, we be but simple husbandmen, and may not often stir from our\nmeadows and acres; even now I bethink me that May is amidst us, and I\nam beginning to be drawn by the thought of the haysel.  Whereas thou-\n-' (and therewith he reddened) 'I doubt that thou hast little to do\nsave the work of chieftains, and we know that such work is but little\nmissed if it be undone.'\n\nThereat Folk-might laughed; and when the others saw that he laughed,\nthey laughed also, else had they foreborne for courtesy's sake.\n\nBut Folk-might answered:  'Nay, chief of the Sickle, I am not\naltogether a chieftain, now we have gotten us peace; and somewhat of\na husbandman shall I be.  Moreover, doubt ye not that I shall do my\nutmost to behold the fair Dale again; for it is but mountains that\nmeet not.'\n\nNow spake Face-of-god to Folk-might, smiling and somewhat softly, and\nsaid:  'Is all forgiven now, since the day when we first felt each\nother's arms?'\n\n'Yea, all,' said Folk-might; 'now hath befallen what I foretold thee\nin Shadowy Vale, that thou mightest pay for all that had come and\ngone, if thou wouldest but look to it.  Indeed thou wert angry with\nme for that saying on that eve of Shadowy Vale; but see thou, in\nthose days I was an older man than thou, and might admonish thee\nsomewhat; but now, though but few days have gone over thine head, yet\nmany deeds have abided in thine hand, and thou art much aged.  Anger\nhath left thee, and wisdom hath waxed in thee.  As for me, I may now\nsay this word:  May the Folk of Burgdale love the Folk of Silver-dale\nas well as I love thee; then shall all be well.'\n\nThen Face-of-god cast his arms about him and kissed him, and turned\naway toward Stone-face and Hall-face his brother, where they stood at\nthe head of the array of the Face; and even therewith came up the\nAlderman somewhat sad and sober of countenance, and he pushed by the\nWar-leader roughly and would not speak with him.\n\nAnd now blew up the horns of the Shepherds, and they began to move on\namidst the shouting of the men of Silver-dale; yet were there amongst\nthe Woodlanders those who wept when they saw their friends verily\ndeparting from them.\n\nBut when they of the foremost of the Host were gotten so far forward\nthat the men of the Face could begin to move, lo! there was Redesman\nwith his fiddle amongst the leaders; and he had done a man's work in\nthe day of battle, and all looked kindly on him.  About him on this\nmorn were some who had learned the craft of singing well together,\nand knew his minstrelsy, and he turned to these and nodded as their\narray moved on, and he drew his bow across the strings, and\nstraightway they fell a-singing, even as it might be thus:\n\n\nBack again to the dear Dale where born was the kindred,\n   Here wend we all living, and liveth our mirth.\nHere afoot fares our joyance, whatever men hindred,\n   Through all wrath of the heavens, all storms of the earth.\n\nO true, we have left here a part of our treasure,\n   The ashes of stout ones, the stems of the shield;\nBut the bold lives they spended have sown us new pleasure,\n   Fair tales for the telling in fold and on field.\n\nFor as oft as we sing of their edges' upheaving,\n   When the yellowing windows shine forth o'er the night,\nTheir names unforgotten with song interweaving\n   Shall draw forth dear drops from the depths of delight.\n\nOr when down by our feet the grey sickles are lying,\n   And behind us is curling the supper-tide smoke,\nNo whit shall they grudge us the joyance undying,\n   Remembrance of men that put from us the yoke.\n\nWhen the huddle of ewes from the fells we have driven,\n   And we see down the Dale the grey reach of the roof,\nWe shall tell of the gift in the battle-joy given,\n   All the fierceness of friends that drave sorrow aloof.\n\nOnce then we lamented, and mourned them departed;\n   Once only, no oftener.  Henceforth shall we fling\nTheir names up aloft, when the merriest hearted\n   To the Fathers unseen of our life-days we sing.\n\n\nThen was there silence in the ranks of men; and many murmured the\nnames of the fallen as they fared on their way from out the Market-\nplace of Silver-stead.  Then once more Redesman and his mates took up\nthe song:\n\n\nCome tell me, O friends, for whom bideth the maiden\n   Wet-foot from the river-ford down in the Dale?\nFor whom hath the goodwife the ox-waggon laden\n   With the babble of children, brown-handed and hale?\n\nCome tell me for what are the women abiding,\n   Till each on the other aweary they lean?\nIs it loitering of evil that thus they are chiding,\n   The slow-footed bearers of sorrow unseen?\n\nNay, yet were they toiling if sorrow had worn them,\n   Or hushed had they bided with lips parched and wan.\nThe birds of the air other tidings have borne them -\n   How glad through the wood goeth man beside man.\n\nThen fare forth, O valiant, and loiter no longer\n   Than the cry of the cuckoo when May is at hand;\nLate waxeth the spring-tide, and daylight grows longer,\n   And nightly the star-street hangs high o'er the land.\n\nMany lives, many days for the Dale do ye carry;\n   When the Host breaketh out from the thicket unshorn,\nIt shall be as the sun that refuseth to tarry\n   On the crown of all mornings, the Midsummer morn.\n\n\nAgain the song fell down till they were well on the western way down\nSilver-dale; and then Redesman handled his fiddle once more, and\nagain the song rose up, and such-like were the words which were borne\nback into the Market-place of Silver-stead:\n\n\nAnd yet what is this, and why fare ye so slowly,\n   While our echoing halls of our voices are dumb,\nAnd abideth unlitten the hearth-brand the holy,\n   And the feet of the kind fare afield till we come?\n\nFor not yet through the wood and its tangle ye wander;\n   Now skirt we no thicket, no path by the mere;\nFar aloof for our feet leads the Dale-road out yonder;\n   Full fair is the morning, its doings all clear.\n\nThere is nought now our feet on the highway delaying\n   Save the friend's loving-kindness, the sundering of speech;\nThe well-willer's word that ends words with the saying,\n   The loth to depart while each looketh on each.\n\nFare on then, for nought are ye laden with sorrow;\n   The love of this land do ye bear with you still.\nIn two Dales of the earth for to-day and to-morrow\n   Is waxing the oak-tree of peace and good-will.\n\n\nThus then they departed from Silver-dale, even as men who were a\nportion thereof, and had not utterly left it behind.  And that night\nthey lay in the wild-wood not very far from the Dale's end; for they\nwent softly, faring amongst so many friends.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.  TALK UPON THE WILD-WOOD WAY\n\n\n\nOn the morrow morning when they were on their way again Face-of-god\nleft his own folk to go with the House of the Steer a while; and\namongst them he fell in with the Sun-beam going along with Bow-may.\nSo they greeted him kindly, and Face-of-god fell into talk with the\nSun-beam as they went side by side through a great oak-wood, where\nfor a space was plain green-sward bare of all underwood.\n\nSo in their talk he said to her:  'What deemest thou, my speech-\nfriend, concerning our coming back to guest in Silver-dale one day?'\n\n'The way is long,' she said.\n\n'That may hinder us but not stay us,' said Face-of-god.\n\n'That is sooth,' said the Sun-beam.\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'What things shall stay us?  Or deemest thou that\nwe shall never see Silver-dale again?'\n\nShe smiled:  'Even so I think thou deemest, Gold-mane.  But many\nthings shall hinder us besides the long road.'\n\nSaid he:  'Yea, and what things?'\n\n'Thinkest thou,' said the Sun-beam, 'that the winning of Silver-stead\nis the last battle which thou shalt see?'\n\n'Nay,' said he, 'nay.'\n\n'Shall thy Dale--our Dale--be free from all trouble within itself\nhenceforward?  Is there a wall built round it to keep out for ever\nstorm, pestilence, and famine, and the waywardness of its own folk?'\n\n'So it is as thou sayest,' quoth Face-of-god, 'and to meet such\ntroubles and overcome them, or to die in strife with them, this is a\ngreat part of a man's life.'\n\n'Yea,' she said, 'and hast thou forgotten that thou art now a great\nchieftain, and that the folk shall look to thee to use thee many days\nin the year?'\n\nHe laughed and said:  'So it is.  How many days have gone by since I\nwandered in the wood last autumn, that the world should have changed\nso much!'\n\n'Many deeds shall now be in thy days,' she said, 'and each deed as\nthe corn of wheat from which cometh many corns; and a man's days on\nthe earth are not over many.'\n\n'Then farewell, Silver-dale!' said he, waving his hand toward the\nnorth.  'War and trouble may bring me back to thee, but it maybe\nnought else shall.  Farewell!'\n\nShe looked on him fondly but unsmiling, as he went beside her strong\nand warrior-like.  Three paces from him went Bow-may, barefoot, in\nher white kirtle, but bearing her bow in her hand; a leash of arrows\nwas in her girdle, her quiver hung at her back, and she was girt with\na sword.  On the other side went Wood-wont and Wood-wise, lightly\nclad but weaponed.  Wood-mother was riding in an ox-wain just behind\nthem, and Wood-father went beside her bearing an axe.  Scattered all\nabout them were the men of the Steer, gaily clad, bearing weapons, so\nthat the oak-wood was bright with them, and the glades merry with\ntheir talk and singing and laughter, and before them down the glades\nwent the banner of the Steer, and the White Beast led them the\nnearest way to Burgdale.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII.  HOW THE HOST CAME HOME AGAIN\n\n\n\nIt was fourteen days before they came to Rose-dale; for they had much\nbaggage with them, and they had no mind to weary themselves, and the\nwood was nothing loathsome to them, whereas the weather was fair and\nbright for the more part.  They fell in with no mishap by the way.\nBut a score and three of runaways joined themselves to the Host,\nhaving watched their goings and wotting that they were not foemen.\nOf these, some had heard of the overthrow of the Dusky Men in Silver-\ndale, and others not.  The Burgdalers received them all, for it\nseemed to them no great matter for a score or so of new-comers to the\nDale.\n\nBut when the Host was come to Rose-dale, they found it fair arid\nlovely; and there they met with those of their folk who had gone with\nDallach.  But Dallach welcomed the kindreds with great joy, and bade\nthem abide; for he said that they had the less need to hasten, since\nhe had sent messengers into Burgdale to tell men there of the\ntidings.  Albeit they were mostly loth to tarry; yet when he lay hard\non them not to depart as men on the morrow of a gild-feast, they\nabode there three days, and were as well guested as might be, and on\ntheir departure they were laden with gifts from the wealth of Rose-\ndale by Dallach and his folk.\n\nBefore they went their ways Dallach spake with Face-of-god and the\nchiefs of the Dalesmen, and said:\n\n'Ye have given me much from the time when ye found me in the wood a\nnaked wastrel; yet now I would ask you a gift to lay on the top of\nall that ye have given me.'\n\nSaid Face-of-god:  'Name the gift, and thou shalt have it; for we\ndeem thee our friend.'\n\n'I am no less,' said Dallach, 'as in time to come I may perchance be\nable to show you.  But now I am asking you to suffer a score or two\nof your men to abide here with me this summer, till I see how this\nfolk new-born again is like to deal with me.  For pleasure and a fair\nlife have become so strange to them, that they scarce know what to do\nwith them, or how to live; and unless all is to go awry, I must needs\ncommand and forbid; and though belike they love me, yet they fear me\nnot; so that when my commandment pleaseth them, they do as I bid, and\nwhen it pleaseth them not, they do contrary to my bidding; for it\nhath got into their minds that I shall in no case lift a hand against\nthem, which indeed is the very sooth.  But your folk they fear as\nwarriors of the world, who have slain the Dusky Men in the Market-\nplace of Silver-stead; and they are of alien blood to them, men who\nwill do as their friend biddeth (think our folk) against them who are\nneither friends or foes.  With such help I shall be well holpen.'\n\nIn such wise spake Dallach; and Face-of-god and the chiefs said that\nso it should be, if men could be found willing to abide in Rose-dale\nfor a while.  And when the matter was put abroad, there was no lack\nof such men amongst the younger warriors, who had noted that the dale\nwas fair amongst dales and its women fairer yet amongst women.\n\nSo two score and ten of the Burgdale men abode in Rose-dale, no one\nof whom was of more than twenty and five winters.  Forsooth divers of\nthem set up house in Rose-dale, and never came back to Burgdale, save\nas guests.  For a half score were wedded in Rose-dale before the\nyear's ending; and seven more, who had also taken to them wives of\nthe goodliest of the Rose-dale women, betook them the next spring to\nthe Burg of the Runaways, and there built them a stead, and drew a\ngarth about it, and dug and sowed the banks of the river, which they\ncalled Inglebourne.  And as years passed, this same stead throve\nexceedingly, and men resorted thither both from Rose-dale and\nBurgdale; for it was a pleasant place; and the land, when it was\ncured, was sweet and good, and the wood thereabout was full of deer\nof all kinds.  So their stead was called Inglebourne after the\nstream; and in latter days it became a very goodly habitation of men.\n\nMoreover, some of the once-enthralled folk of Rose-dale, when they\nknew that men of their kindred from Silver-dale were going home with\nthe men of Burgdale to dwell in the Dale, prayed hard to go along\nwith them; for they looked on the Burgdalers as if they were new Gods\nof the Earth.  The Burgdale chiefs would not gainsay these men\neither, but took with them three score and ten from Rose-dale, men\nand women, and promised them dwelling and livelihood in Burgdale.\n\nSo now with good hearts the Host of Burgdale turned their faces\ntoward their well-beloved Dale; and they made good diligence, so that\nin three days' time they were come anigh the edge of the woodland\nwilderness.  Thither in the even-tide, as they were making ready for\ntheir last supper and bed in the wood, came three men and two women\nof their folk, who had been abiding their coming ever since they had\nhad the tidings of Silver-dale and the battles from Dallach.  Great\nwas the joy of these messengers as they went from company to company\nof the warriors, and saw the familiar faces of their friends, and\nheard their wonted voices telling all the story of battle and\nslaughter.  And for their part the men of the Host feasted these\nstay-at-homes, and made much of them.  But one of them, a man of the\nHouse of the Face, left the Host a little after nightfall, and bore\nback to Burgstead at once the tidings of the coming home of the Host.\nAlbeit since Dallach's tidings of victory had come to the Dale, the\ndwellers in the steads of the country-side had left Burgstead and\ngone home to their own houses; so that there was no great multitude\nabiding in the Thorp.\n\nSo early on the morrow was the Host astir; but ere they came to\nWildlake's Way, the Shepherd-folk turned aside westward to go home,\nafter they had bidden farewell to their friends and fellows of the\nDale; for their souls longed for the sheepcotes in the winding\nvalleys under the long grey downs; and the garths where the last\nyear's ricks shouldered up against the old stone gables, and where\nthe daws were busy in the tall unfrequent ash-trees; and the green\nflowery meadows adown along the bright streams, where the crowfoot\nand the paigles were blooming now, and the harebells were in flower\nabout the thorn-bushes at the down's foot, whence went the savour of\ntheir blossom over sheep-walk and water-meadow.\n\nSo these went their ways with many kind words; and two hours\nafterwards all the rest of the Host stood on the level ground of the\nPortway; but presently were the ranks of war disordered and broken up\nby the joy of the women and children, as they fell to drawing goodman\nor brother or lover out of the throng to the way that led speediest\nto their homesteads and halls.  For the War-leader would not hold the\nHost together any longer, but suffered each man to go to his home,\ndeeming that the men of Burgstead, and chiefly they of the Face and\nthe Steer, would suffice for a company if any need were, and they\nwould be easily gathered to meet any hap.\n\nSo now the men of the Middle and Lower Dale made for their houses by\nthe road and the lanes and the meadows, and the men of the Upper Dale\nand Burgstead went their ways along the Portway toward their halls,\nwith the throng of women and children that had come out to meet them.\nAnd now men came home when it was yet early, and the long day lay\nbefore them; and it was, as it were, made giddy and cumbered with the\nexceeding joy of return, and the thought of the day when the fear of\ndeath and sundering had been ever in their hearts.  For these new\nhours were full of the kissing and embracing of lovers, and the\nsweetness of renewed delight in beholding the fair bodies so sorely\ndesired, and hearkening the soft wheedling of longed-for voices.\nThere were the cups of friends beneath the chestnut trees, and the\ntalk of the deeds of the fighting-men, and of the heavy days of the\nhome-abiders; many a tale told oft and o'er again.  There was the\nsinging of old songs and of new, and the beholding the well-loved\nnook of the pleasant places, which death might well have made nought\nfor them; and they were sweet with the fear of that which was past,\nand in their pleasantness was fresh promise for the days to come.\n\nSo amid their joyance came evening and nightfall; and though folk\nwere weary with the fulness of delight, yet now for many their\nweariness led them to the chamber of love before the rest of deep\nnight came to them to make them strong for the happy life to be begun\nagain on the morrow.\n\nHouse by house they feasted, and few were the lovers that sat not\ntogether that even.  But Face-of-god and the Sun-beam parted at the\ndoor of the House of the Face; for needs must she go with her new\nfolk to the House of the Steer, and needs must Face-of-god be amongst\nhis own folk in that hour of high-tide, and sit beside his father\nbeneath the image of the God with the ray-begirt head.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVIII.  HOW THE MAIDEN WARD WAS HELD IN BURGDALE\n\n\n\nNow May was well worn when the Host came home to Burgdale; and on the\nvery morrow of men's home-coming they began to talk eagerly of the\nMidsummer Weddings, and how the Maiden Ward would be the greatest and\nfairest of all yet seen, whereas battle and the deliverance from\nbattle stir up the longing and love both of men and maidens; much\nalso men spake of the wedding of Face-of-god and the Sun-beam; and\nneeds must their wedding abide to the time of the Maiden Ward at\nMidsummer, and needs also must the Sun-beam go on the Ward with the\nother Brides of the Folk.  So then must Face-of-god keep his soul in\npatience till those few days were over, doing what work came to hand;\nand he held his head high among the people, and was well looked to of\nevery man.\n\nIn all matters the Sun-beam helped him, both in doing and in\nforbearing; and now so wonderful and rare was her beauty, that folk\nlooked on her with somewhat of fear, as though she came from the very\nfolk of the Gods.\n\nIndeed she seemed somewhat changed from what she had been of late;\nshe was sober of demeanour during these last days of her maidenhood,\nand sat amongst the kindred as one communing with herself:  of few\nwords she was and little laughter; but her face clear, not overcast\nby any gloom or shaken by passion:  soft and kind was she in converse\nwith others, and sweet were the smiles that came into her face if\nothers' faces seemed to crave for them.  For it must be said that as\nsome folk eat out their hearts with fear of the coming evils, even so\nwas she feeding her soul with the joy of the days to be, whatever\ntrouble might fall upon them, whereof belike she foreboded some.\n\nSo wore the days toward Midsummer, when the wheat was getting past\nthe blossoming, and the grass in the mown fields was growing deep\ngreen again after the shearing of the scythe; when the leaves were\nmost and biggest; when the roses were beginning to fall; when the\napples were reddening, and the skins of the grape-berries gathering\nbloom.  High aloft floated the light clouds over the Dale; deep blue\nshowed the distant fells below the ice-mountains; the waters\ndwindled; all things sought the shadow by daytime, and the twilight\nof even and the twilight of dawn were but sundered by three hours of\nhalf-dark night.\n\nSo in the bright forenoon were seventeen brides assembled in the Gate\nof Burgstead (but of the rest of the Dale were twenty and three\nlooked for), and with these was the Sun-beam, her face as calm as the\nmountain lake under a summer sunset, while of the others many were\nrestless, and babbling like April throstles; and not a few talked to\nher eagerly, and in their restless love of her dragged her about\nhither and thither.\n\nNo men were to be seen that morning; for such was the custom, that\nthe carles either departed to the fields and the acres, or abode\nwithin doors on the morn of the day of the Maiden Ward; but there was\na throng of women about the Gate and down the street of Burgstead,\nand it may well be deemed that they kept not silence that hour.\n\nSo fared the Brides of Burgstead to the place of the Maiden Ward on\nthe causeway, whereto were come already the other brides from steads\nup and down the Dale, or were even then close at hand on the way; and\namong them were Long-coat and her two fellows, with whom Face-of-god\nhad held converse on that morning whereon he had followed his fate to\nthe Mountain.\n\nThere then were they gathered under the cliff-wall of the Portway;\nand by the road-side had their grooms built them up bowers of green\nboughs to shelter them from the sun's burning, which were thatched\nwith bulrushes, and decked with garlands of the fairest flowers of\nthe meadows and the gardens.\n\nForsooth they were a lovely sight to look on, for no fairer women\nmight be seen in the world; and the eldest of them was scant of five\nand twenty winters.  Every maiden was clad in as goodly raiment as\nshe might compass; their sleeves and gown-hems and girdles, yea,\ntheir very shoes and sandals were embroidered so fairly and closely,\nthat as they shifted in the sun they changed colour like the king-\nfisher shooting from shadow to sunshine.  According to due custom\nevery maiden bore some weapon.  A few had bows in their hands and\nquivers at their backs; some had nought but a sword girt to their\nsides; some bore slender-shafted spears, so as not to overburden\ntheir shapely hands; but to some it seemed a merry game to carry long\nand heavy thrust-spears, or to bear great war-axes over their\nshoulders.  Most had their flowing hair coifed with bright helms;\nsome had burdened their arms with shields; some bore steel hauberks\nover their linen smocks:  almost all had some piece of war-gear on\ntheir bodies; and one, to wit, Steed-linden of the Sickle, a tall and\nfair damsel, was so arrayed that no garment could be seen on her but\nbright steel war-gear.\n\nAs for the Sun-beam, she was clad in a white kirtle embroidered from\nthroat to hem with work of green boughs and flowers of the goodliest\nfashion, and a garland of roses on her head.  Dale-warden himself was\ngirt to her side by a girdle fair-wrought of golden wire, and she\nbore no other weapon or war-gear; and she let him lie quiet in his\nscabbard, nor touched the hilts once; whereas some of the other\ndamsels would be ever drawing their swords out and thrusting them\nback.  But all noted that goodly weapon, the yoke-fellow of so many\ngreat deeds.\n\nThere then on the Portway, between the water and the rock-wall, rose\nup plenteous and gleeful talk of clear voices shrill and soft; and\nwhiles the maidens sang, and whiles they told tales of old days, and\nwhiles they joined hands and danced together on the sweet summer dust\nof the highway.  Then they mostly grew aweary, and sat down on the\nbanks of the road or under their leafy bowers.\n\nNoon came, and therewithal goodwives of the neighbouring Dale, who\nbrought them meat and drink, and fruit and fresh flowers from the\nteeming gardens; and thereafter for a while they nursed their joy in\ntheir bosoms, and spake but little and softly while the day was at\nits hottest in the early afternoon.\n\nThen came out of Burgstead men making semblance of chapmen with a\nwain bearing wares, and they made as though they were wending down\nthe Portway westward to go out of the Dale.  Then arose the weaponed\nmaidens and barred the way to them, and turned them back amidst\nfresh-springing merriment.\n\nAgain in a while, when the sun was westering and the shadows growing\nlong, came herdsmen from down the Dale driving neat, and making as\nthough they would pass by into Burgstead, but to them also did the\nmaidens gainsay the road, so that needs must they turn back amidst\nlaughter and mockery, they themselves also laughing and mocking.\n\nAnd so at last, when the maidens had been all alone a while, and it\nwas now hard on sunset, they drew together and stood in a ring, and\nfell to singing; and one Gold-may of the House of the Bridge, a most\nsweet singer, stood amidst their ring and led them.  And this is\nsomewhat of the meaning of their words:\n\n\nThe sun will not tarry; now changeth the light,\nFail the colours that marry the Day to the Night.\n\nAmid the sun's burning bright weapons we bore,\nFor this eve of our earning comes once and no more.\n\nFor to-day hath no brother in yesterday's tide,\nAnd to-morrow no other alike it doth hide.\n\nThis day is the token of oath and behest\nThat ne'er shall be broken through ill days and best.\n\nHere the troth hath been given, the oath hath been done,\nTo the Folk that hath thriven well under the sun.\n\nAnd the gifts of its giving our troth-day shall win\nAre the Dale for our living and dear days therein.\n\nO Sun, now thou wanest! yet come back and see\nAmidst all that thou gainest how gainful are we.\n\nO witness of sorrow wide over the earth,\nRise up on the morrow to look on our mirth!\n\nThy blooms art thou bringing back ever for men,\nAnd thy birds are a-singing each summer again.\n\nBut to men little-hearted what winter is worse\nThan thy summers departed that bore them the curse?\n\nAnd e'en such art thou knowing where thriveth the year,\nAnd good is all growing save thralldom and fear.\n\nNought such be our lovers' hearts drawing anigh,\nWhile yet thy light hovers aloft in the sky.\n\nLo the seeker, the finder of Death in the Blade!\nWhat lips shall be kinder on lips of mine laid?\n\nLa he that hath driven back tribes of the South!\nSweet-breathed is thine even, but sweeter his mouth.\n\nCome back from the sea then, O sun! come aback,\nLook adown, look on me then, and ask what I lack!\n\nCome many a morrow to gaze on the Dale,\nAnd if e'er thou seest sorrow remember its tale!\n\nFor 'twill be of a story to tell how men died\nIn the garnering of glory that no man may hide.\n\nO sun sinking under!  O fragrance of earth!\nO heart!  O the wonder whence longing has birth!\n\n\nSo they sang, and the sun sank indeed; and amidst their singing the\neve was still about them, though there came a happy murmur from the\nface of the meadows and the houses of the Thorp aloof.  But as their\nsong fell they heard the sound of footsteps a many on the road; so\nthey turned and stood with beating hearts in such order as when a\nband of the valiant draw together to meet many foes coming on them\nfrom all sides, and they stand back to back to face all comers.  And\neven therewith, their raiment gleaming amidst the gathering dusk,\ncame on them the young men of the Dale newly delivered from the grief\nof war.\n\nThen in very deed the fierce mouths of the raisers of the war-shout\nwere kind on the faces of tender maidens.  Then went spear and axe\nand helm and shield clattering to the earth, as the arms of the new-\ncomers went round about the bodies of the Brides, weary with the long\nday of sunshine, and glee and loving speech, and the maidens suffered\nthe young men to lead them whither they would, and twilight began to\ndraw round about them as the Maiden Band was sundered.\n\nSome, they were led away westward down the Portway to the homesteads\nthereabout; and for divers of these the way was long to their halls,\nand they would have to wend over long stretches of dewy meadows, and\nhear the night-wind whisper in many a tree, and see the east begin to\nlighten with the dawn before they came to the lighted feast that\nawaited them.  But some turned up the Portway straight towards\nBurgstead; and short was their road to the halls where even now the\nlights were being kindled for their greeting.\n\nAs for the Sun-beam, she had been very quiet the day long, speaking\nas little as she might do, laughing not at all, and smiling for\nkindness' sake rather than for merriment; and when the grooms came\nseeking their maidens, she withdrew herself from the band, and stood\nalone amidst the road nigher to Burgstead than they; and her heart\nbeat hard, and her breath came short and quick, as though fear had\ncaught her in its grip; and indeed for one moment of time she feared\nthat he was not coming to her.  For he had gone with the other grooms\nto that gathered band, and had passed from one to the other, not\nfinding her, till he had got him through the whole company, and\nbeheld her awaiting him.  Then indeed he bounded toward her, and\ncaught her by the hands, and then by the shoulders, and drew her to\nhim, and she nothing loth; and in that while he said to her:\n\n'Come then, my friend; lo thou! they go each their own way toward the\nhalls of their houses; and for thee have I chosen a way--a way over\nthe foot-bridge yonder, and over the dewy meadows on this best even\nof the year.'\n\n'Nay, nay,' she said, 'it may not be.  Surely the Burgstead grooms\nlook to thee to lead them to the gate; and surely in the House of the\nFace they look to see thee before any other.  Nay, Gold-mane, my\ndear, we must needs go by the Portway.'\n\nHe said:  'We shall be home but a very little while after the first,\nfor the way I tell of is as short as the Portway.  But hearken, my\nsweet!  When we are in the meadows we shall sit down for a minute on\na bank under the chestnut trees, and thence watch the moon coming up\nover the southern cliffs.  And I shall behold thee in the summer\nnight, and deem that I see all thy beauty; which yet shall make me\ndumb with wonder when I see it indeed in the house amongst the\ncandles.'\n\n'O nay,' she said, 'by the Portway shall we go; the torch-bearers\nshall be abiding thee at the gate.'\n\nSpake Face-of-god:  'Then shall we rise up and wend first through a\nwide treeless meadow, wherein amidst the night we shall behold the\nkine moving about like odorous shadows; and through the greyness of\nthe moonlight thou shalt deem that thou seest the pink colour of the\neglantine blossoms, so fragrant they are.'\n\n'O nay,' she said, 'but it is meet that we go by the Portway.'\n\nBut he said:  'Then from the wide meadow come we into a close of\ncorn, and then into an orchard-close beyond it.  There in the ancient\nwalnut-tree the owl sitteth breathing hard in the night-time; but\nthou shalt not hear him for the joy of the nightingales singing from\nthe apple-trees of the close.  Then from out of the shadowed orchard\nshall we come into the open town-meadow, and over its daisies shall\nthe moonlight be lying in a grey flood of brightness.\n\n'Short is the way across it to the brim of the Weltering Water, and\nacross the water lieth the fair garden of the Face; and I have dight\nfor thee there a little boat to waft us across the night-dark waters,\nthat shall be like wavering flames of white fire where the moon\nsmites them, and like the void of all things where the shadows hang\nover them.  There then shall we be in the garden, beholding how the\nhall-windows are yellow, and hearkening the sound of the hall-glee\nborne across the flowers and blending with the voice of the\nnightingales in the trees.  There then shall we go along the grass\npaths whereby the pinks and the cloves and the lavender are sending\nforth their fragrance, to cheer us, who faint at the scent of the\nover-worn roses, and the honey-sweetness of the lilies.\n\n'All this is for thee, and for nought but for thee this even; and\nmany a blossom whereof thou knowest nought shall grieve if thy foot\ntread not thereby to-night; if the path of thy wedding which I have\nmade, be void of thee, on the even of the Chamber of Love.\n\n'But lo! at last at the garden's end is the yew-walk arched over for\nthee, and thou canst not see whereby to enter it; but I, I know it,\nand I lead thee into and along the dark tunnel through the moonlight,\nand thine hand is not weary of mine as we go.  But at the end shall\nwe come to a wicket, which shall bring us out by the gable-end of the\nHall of the Face.  Turn we about its corner then, and there are we\nblinking on the torches of the torch-bearers, and the candles through\nthe open door, and the hall ablaze with light and full of joyous\nclamour, like the bale-fire in the dark night kindled on a ness above\nthe sea by fisher-folk remembering the Gods.'\n\n'O nay,' she said, 'but by the Portway must we go; the straightest\nway to the Gate of Burgstead.'\n\nIn vain she spake, and knew not what she said; for even as he was\nspeaking he led her away, and her feet went as her will went, rather\nthan her words; and even as she said that last word she set her foot\non the first board of the foot-bridge; and she turned aback one\nmoment, and saw the long line of the rock-wall yet glowing with the\nlast of the sunset of midsummer, while as she turned again, lo!\nbefore her the moon just beginning to lift himself above the edge of\nthe southern cliffs, and betwixt her and him all Burgdale, and Face-\nof-god moreover.\n\nThus then they crossed the bridge into the green meadows, and through\nthe closes and into the garden of the Face and unto the Hall-door;\nand other brides and grooms were there before them (for six grooms\nhad brought home brides to the House of the Face); but none deemed it\namiss in the War-leader of the folk and the love that had led him.\nAnd old Stone-face said:  'Too many are the rows of bee-skeps in the\ngardens of the Dale that we should begrudge wayward lovers an hour's\nwaste of candle-light.'\n\nSo at last those twain went up the sun-bright Hall hand in hand in\nall their loveliness, and up on to the dais, and stood together by\nthe middle seat; and the tumult of the joy of the kindred was hushed\nfor a while as they saw that there was speech in the mouth of the\nWar-leader.\n\nThen he spread his hands abroad before them all and cried out:  'How\nthen have I kept mine oath, whereas I swore on the Holy Boar to wed\nthe fairest woman of the world?'\n\nA mighty shout went rattling about the timbers of the roof in answer\nto his word; and they that looked up to the gable of the Hall said\nthat they saw the ray-ringed image of the God smile with joy over the\ngathered folk.\n\nBut spake Iron-face unheard amidst the clamour of the Hall:  'How\nfares it now with my darling and my daughter, who dwelleth amongst\nstrangers in the land beyond the wild-wood?'\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIX.  THE BEHEST OF FACE-OF-GOD TO THE BRIDE ACCOMPLISHED:  A\nMOTE-STEAD APPOINTED FOR THE THREE FOLKS, TO WIT, THE MEN OF\nBURGDALE, THE SHEPHERDS, AND THE CHILDREN OF THE WOLF\n\n\n\nThree years and two months thereafter, three hours after noon in the\ndays of early autumn, came a wain tilted over with precious webs of\ncloth, and drawn by eight white oxen, into the Market-place of\nSilver-stead:  two score and ten of spearmen of the tallest, clad in\ngoodly war-gear, went beside it, and much people of Silver-dale\nthronged about them.  The wain stayed at the foot of the stair that\nled up to the door of the Mote-house, and there lighted down\ntherefrom a woman goodly of fashion, with wide grey eyes, and face\nand hands brown with the sun's burning.  She had a helm on her head\nand a sword girt to her side, and in her arms she bore a yearling\nchild.\n\nAnd there was come Bow-may with the second man-child born to Face-of-\ngod.\n\nShe stayed not amidst the wondering folk, but hastened up the stair,\nwhich she had once seen running with the blood of men:  the door was\nopen, and she went in and walked straight-way, with the babe in her\narms, up the great Hall to the dais.\n\nThere were men on the dais:  amidmost sat Folk-might, little changed\nsince the last day she had seen him, yet fairer, she deemed, than of\nold time; and her heart went forth to meet the Chieftain of her Folk,\nand the glad tears started in her eyes and ran down her cheeks as she\ndrew near to him.\n\nBy his side sat the Bride, and her also Bow-may deemed to have waxed\ngoodlier.  Both she and Folk-might knew Bow-may ere she had gone half\nthe length of the hall; and the Bride rose up in her place and cried\nout Bow-may's name joyously.\n\nWith these were sitting the elders of the Wolf and the Woodlanders,\nthe more part of whom Bow-may knew well.\n\nOn the dais also stood aside a score of men weaponed, and looking as\nif they were awaiting the word which should send them forth on some\nerrand.\n\nNow stood up Folk-might and said:  'Fair greeting and love to my\nfriend and the daughter of my Folk!  How farest thou, Bow-may, best\nof all friendly women?  How fareth my sister, and Face-of-god my\nbrother? and how is it with our friends and helpers in the goodly\nDale?'\n\nSaid Bow-may:  'It is well both with all those and with me; and my\nheart laughs to see thee, Folk-might, and to look on the elders of\nthe valiant, and our lovely sister the Bride.  But I have a message\nfor thee from Face-of-god:  wilt thou that I deliver it here?'\n\n'Yea surely,' said Folk-might, and came forth. and took her hand, and\nkissed her cheeks and her mouth.  The Bride also came forth and cast\nher arms about her, and kissed her; and they led her between them to\na seat on the dais beside Folk-might.\n\nBut all men looked on the child in her arms and wondered what it was.\nBut Bow-may took the babe, which was both fair and great, and set it\non the knees of the Bride, and said:\n\n'Thus saith Face-of-god:  \"Friend and kinswoman, well-beloved\nplaymate, the gift which thou badest of me in sorrow do thou now take\nin joy, and do all the good thou wouldest to the son of thy friend.\nThe ring which I gave thee once in the garden of the Face, give thou\nto Bow-may, my trusty and well-beloved, in token of the fulfilment of\nmy behest.\"'\n\nThen the Bride kissed Bow-may again, and fell to fondling of the\nchild, which was loth to leave Bow-may.\n\nBut she spake again:  'To thee also, Folk-might, I have a message\nfrom Face-of-god, who saith:  \"Mighty warrior, friend and fellow, all\nthings thrive with us, and we are happy.  Yet is there a hollow place\nin our hearts which grieveth us, and only thou and thine may amend\nit.  Though whiles we hear tell of thee, yet we see thee not, and\nfain were we, might we see thee, and wot if the said tales be true.\nWilt thou help us somewhat herein, or wilt thou leave us all the\nlabour?  For sure we be that thou wilt not say that thou rememberest\nus no more, and that thy love for us is departed.\"  This is his\nmessage, Folk-might, and he would have an answer from thee.'\n\nThen laughed Folk-might and said:  'Sister Bow-may, seest thou these\nweaponed men hereby?'\n\n'Yea,' she said.\n\nSaid he:  'These men bear a message with them to Face-of-god my\nbrother.  Crow the Shaft-speeder, stand forth and tell thy friend\nBow-may the message I have set in thy mouth, every word of it.'\n\nThen Crow stood forth and greeted Bow-may friendly, and said:\n'Friend Bow-may, this is the message of our Alderman:  \"Friend and\nhelper, in the Dale which thou hast given to us do all things thrive;\nneither are we grown old in three years' wearing, nor are our\nmemories worsened.  We long sore to see you and give you guesting in\nSilver-dale, and one day that shall befall.  Meanwhile, know this:\nthat we of the Wolf and the Woodland, mindful of the earth that bore\nus, and the pit whence we were digged, have a mind to go see Shadowy\nVale once in every three years, and there to hold high-tide in the\nancient Hall of the Wolf, and sit in the Doom-ring of our Fathers.\nBut since ye have joined yourselves to us in battle, and have given\nus this Dale, our health and wealth, without price and without\nreward, we deem you our very brethren, and small shall be our hall-\nglee, and barren shall our Doom-ring seem to us, unless ye sit there\nbeside us.  Come then, that we may rejoice each other by the sight of\nface and sound of voice; that we may speak together of matters that\nconcern our welfare; so that we three Kindreds may become one Folk.\nAnd if this seem good to you, know that we shall be in Shadowy Vale\nin a half-month's wearing.  Grieve us not by forbearing to come.\"\nLo, Bow-may, this is the message, and I have learned it well, for\nwell it pleaseth me to bear it.'\n\nThen said Folk-might:  'What say'st thou to the message, Bow-may?'\n\n'It is good in all ways,' said she, 'but is it timely?  May our folk\nhave the message and get to Shadowy Vale, so as to meet you there?'\n\n'Yea surely,' said Folk-might, 'for our kinsmen here shall take the\nroad through Shadowy Vale, and in four days' time they shall be in\nBurgdale, and as thou wottest, it is scant a two days' journey thence\nto Shadowy Vale.'\n\nTherewith he turned to those men again, and said:  'Kinsman Crow,\ndepart now, and use all diligence with thy message.'\n\nSo the messengers began to stir; but Bow-may cried out:  'Ho!  Folk-\nmight, my friend, I perceive thou art little changed from the man I\nknew in Shadowy Vale, who would have his dinner before the fowl were\nplucked.  For shall I not go back with these thy messengers, so that\nI also may get all ready to wend to the Mote-house of Shadowy Vale?'\n\nBut the Bride looked kindly on her, and laughed and said:  'Sister\nBow-may, his meaning is that thou shouldest abide here in Silver-dale\ntill we depart for the Folk-thing, and then go thither with us; and\nthis I also pray thee to do, that thou mayst rejoice the hearts of\nthine old friends; and also that thou mayst teach me all that I\nshould know concerning this fair child of my brother and my sister.'\n\nAnd she looked on her so kindly as she caressed the babe, that Bow-\nmay's heart melted, and she cried out:\n\n'Would that I might never depart from the house wherein thou\ndwellest, O Bride of my Kinsman!  And this that thou biddest me is\neasy and pleasant for me to do.  But afterwards I must get me back to\nBurgdale; for I seem to have left much there that calleth for me.'\n\n'Yea,' said Folk-might, 'and art thou wedded, Bow-may?  Shalt thou\nnever bend the yew in battle again?'\n\nSaid Bow-may soberly:  'Who knoweth, chieftain?  Yea, I am wedded now\nthese two years; and nought I looked for less when I followed those\ntwain through the wild-wood to Burgdale.'\n\nShe sighed therewith, and said:  'In all the Dale there is no better\nman of his hands than my man, nor any goodlier to look on, and he is\neven that Hart of Highcliff whom thou knowest well, O Bride!'\n\nSaid the Bride:  'Thou sayest sooth, there is no better man in the\nDale.'\n\nSaid Bow-may:  'Sun-beam bade me wed him when he pressed hard upon\nme.'  She stayed awhile, and then said:  'Face-of-god also deemed I\nshould not naysay the man; and now my son by him is of like age to\nthis little one.'\n\n'Good is thy story,' said Folk-might; 'or deemest thou, Bow-may, that\nsuch strong and goodly women as thou, and women so kind and friendly,\nshould forbear the wedding and the bringing forth of children?  Yea,\nand we who may even yet have to gather to another field before we\ndie, and fight for life and the goods of life.'\n\n'Thou sayest well,' she said; 'all that hath befallen me is good\nsince the day whereon I loosed shaft from the break of the bent over\nyonder.'\n\nTherewith she fell a-musing, and made as though she were hearkening\nto the soft voice of the Bride caressing the new-come baby; but in\nsooth neither heard nor saw what was going on about her, for her\nthoughts were in bygone days.  Howbeit presently she came to herself\nagain, and fell to asking many questions concerning Silver-dale and\nthe kindred, and those who had once been thralls of the Dusky Men;\nand they answered all duly, and told her the whole story of the Dale\nsince the Day of the Victory.\n\nSo Bow-may and the carles who had come with her abode for that half-\nmonth in Silver-dale, guested in all love by the folk thereof, both\nthe kindreds and the poor folk.  And Bow-may deemed that the Bride\nloved Face-of-god's child little less than her own, whereof she had\ntwo, a man and a woman; and thereat was she full of joy, since she\nknew that Face-of-god and the Sun-beam would be fain thereof.\n\nThereafter, when the time was come, fared Folk-might and the Bride,\nand many of the elders and warriors of the Wolf and the Woodland, to\nShadowy Vale; and Dallach and the best of Rose-dale went with them,\nbeing so bidden; and Bow-may and her following, according to the word\nof the Bride.  And in Shadowy Vale they met Face-of-god and Alderman\nIron-face, and the chiefs of Burgdale and the Shepherds, and many\nothers; and great joy there was at the meeting.  And the Sun-beam\nremembered the word which she spoke to Face-of-god when first he came\nto Shadowy Vale, that she would be wishful to see again the dwelling\nwherein she had passed through so much joy and sorrow of her younger\ndays.  But if anyone were fain of this meeting, the Alderman was glad\nabove all, when he took the Bride once more in his arms, and caressed\nher whom he had deemed should be a very daughter of his House.\n\nNow telleth the tale of all these kindreds, to wit, the Men of\nBurgdale and the Sheepcotes; and the Children of the Wolf, and the\nWoodlanders, and the Men of Rose-dale, that they were friends\nhenceforth, and became as one Folk, for better or worse, in peace and\nin war, in waning and waxing; and that whatsoever befell them, they\never held Shadowy Vale a holy place, and for long and long after they\nmet there in mid-autumn, and held converse and counsel together.\n\nNO MORE AS NOW TELLETH THE TALE OF THESE KINDREDS AND FOLKS, BUT\nMAKETH AN ENDING.\n\n\n\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK, THE ROOTS OF THE MOUNTAINS ***\n\nThis file should be named rtmt10.txt or rtmt10.zip\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, rtmt11.txt\nVERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, rtmt10a.txt\n\nProject Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US\nunless a copyright notice is included.

The\ntime it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours\nto get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\nmillion dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text\nfiles per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+\nWe are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002\nIf they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total\nwill reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.\n\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\nwhich is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.\n\nHere is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):\n\neBooks Year Month\n\n    1  1971 July\n   10  1991 January\n  100  1994 January\n 1000  1997 August\n 1500  1998 October\n 2000  1999 December\n 2500  2000 December\n 3000  2001 November\n 4000  2001 October/November\n 6000  2002 December*\n 9000  2003 November*\n10000  2004 January*\n\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created\nto secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.\n\nWe need your donations more than ever!\n\nAs of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people\nand organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,\nDelaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois,\nIndiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts,\nMichigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New\nHampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio,\nOklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South\nDakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West\nVirginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\n\nWe have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones\nthat have responded.\n\nAs the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list\nwill be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.\nPlease feel free to ask to check the status of your state.\n\nIn answer to various questions we have received on this:\n\nWe are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally\nrequest donations in all 50 states.
