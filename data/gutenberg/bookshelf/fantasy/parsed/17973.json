THOMSON _at_ 10,\nCRAVEN GARDENS, WIMBLEDON, S. W.\nMCMVI\n\n_In the tales . . . the world is one of pure romance.  Mediaeval customs,\nmediaeval buildings, the mediaeval Catholic religion, the general social\nframework of the thirteenth or fourteenth century, are assumed\nthroughout, but it would be idle to attempt to place them in any known\nage or country. . .  Their author in later years thought, or seemed to\nthink, lightly of them, calling them crude (as they are) and very young\n(as they are).  But they are nevertheless comparable in quality to\nKeats's 'Endymion' as rich in imagination, as irregularly gorgeous in\nlanguage, as full in every vein and fibre of the sweet juices and ferment\nof the spring_.--J. W. MACKAIL\n\nIn his last year at Oxford, Morris established, assuming the entire\nfinancial responsibility, the 'Oxford and Cambridge Magazine,' written\nalmost entirely by himself and his college friends, but also numbering\nRossetti among its contributors.  Like most college ventures, its career\nwas short, ending with its twelfth issue in December, 1856.  In this\nmagazine Morris first found his strength as a writer, and though his\nsubsequent literary achievements made him indifferent to this earlier\nwork, its virility and wealth of romantic imagination justify its rescue\nfrom oblivion.\n\nThe article on Amiens, intended originally as the first of a series, is\nincluded in this volume as an illustration of Morris's power to clothe\nthings actual with the glamour of Romance.\n\n\n\n\nTHE STORY OF THE UNKNOWN CHURCH\n\n\nI was the master-mason of a church that was built more than six hundred\nyears ago; it is now two hundred years since that church vanished from\nthe face of the earth; it was destroyed utterly,--no fragment of it was\nleft; not even the great pillars that bore up the tower at the cross,\nwhere the choir used to join the nave.  No one knows now even where it\nstood, only in this very autumn-tide, if you knew the place, you would\nsee the heaps made by the earth-covered ruins heaving the yellow corn\ninto glorious waves, so that the place where my church used to be is as\nbeautiful now as when it stood in all its splendour.  I do not remember\nvery much about the land where my church was; I have quite forgotten the\nname of it, but I know it was very beautiful, and even now, while I am\nthinking of it, comes a flood of old memories, and I almost seem to see\nit again,--that old beautiful land! only dimly do I see it in spring and\nsummer and winter, but I see it in autumn-tide clearly now; yes, clearer,\nclearer, oh! so bright and glorious! yet it was beautiful too in spring,\nwhen the brown earth began to grow green: beautiful in summer, when the\nblue sky looked so much bluer, if you could hem a piece of it in between\nthe new white carving; beautiful in the solemn starry nights, so solemn\nthat it almost reached agony--the awe and joy one had in their great\nbeauty.  But of all these beautiful times, I remember the whole only of\nautumn-tide; the others come in bits to me; I can think only of parts of\nthem, but all of autumn; and of all days and nights in autumn, I remember\none more particularly.  That autumn day the church was nearly finished\nand the monks, for whom we were building the church, and the people, who\nlived in the town hard by, crowded round us oftentimes to watch us\ncarving.\n\nNow the great Church, and the buildings of the Abbey where the monks\nlived, were about three miles from the town, and the town stood on a hill\noverlooking the rich autumn country: it was girt about with great walls\nthat had overhanging battlements, and towers at certain places all along\nthe walls, and often we could see from the churchyard or the Abbey\ngarden, the flash of helmets and spears, and the dim shadowy waving of\nbanners, as the knights and lords and men-at-arms passed to and fro along\nthe battlements; and we could see too in the town the three spires of the\nthree churches; and the spire of the Cathedral, which was the tallest of\nthe three, was gilt all over with gold, and always at night-time a great\nlamp shone from it that hung in the spire midway between the roof of the\nchurch and the cross at the top of the spire.  The Abbey where we built\nthe Church was not girt by stone walls, but by a circle of poplar trees,\nand whenever a wind passed over them, were it ever so little a breath, it\nset them all a-ripple; and when the wind was high, they bowed and swayed\nvery low, and the wind, as it lifted the leaves, and showed their silvery\nwhite sides, or as again in the lulls of it, it let them drop, kept on\nchanging the trees from green to white, and white to green; moreover,\nthrough the boughs and trunks of the poplars, we caught glimpses of the\ngreat golden corn sea, waving, waving, waving for leagues and leagues;\nand among the corn grew burning scarlet poppies, and blue corn-flowers;\nand the corn-flowers were so blue, that they gleamed, and seemed to burn\nwith a steady light, as they grew beside the poppies among the gold of\nthe wheat.  Through the corn sea ran a blue river, and always green\nmeadows and lines of tall poplars followed its windings.  The old Church\nhad been burned, and that was the reason why the monks caused me to build\nthe new one; the buildings of the Abbey were built at the same time as\nthe burned-down Church, more than a hundred years before I was born, and\nthey were on the north side of the Church, and joined to it by a cloister\nof round arches, and in the midst of the cloister was a lawn, and in the\nmidst of that lawn, a fountain of marble, carved round about with flowers\nand strange beasts, and at the edge of the lawn, near the round arches,\nwere a great many sun-flowers that were all in blossom on that autumn\nday, and up many of the pillars of the cloister crept passion-flowers and\nroses.  Then farther from the Church, and past the cloister and its\nbuildings, were many detached buildings, and a great garden round them,\nall within the circle of the poplar trees; in the garden were trellises\ncovered over with roses, and convolvolus, and the great-leaved fiery\nnasturium; and specially all along by the poplar trees were there\ntrellises, but on these grew nothing but deep crimson roses; the\nhollyhocks too were all out in blossom at that time, great spires of\npink, and orange, and red, and white, with their soft, downy leaves.  I\nsaid that nothing grew on the trellises by the poplars but crimson roses,\nbut I was not quite right, for in many places the wild flowers had crept\ninto the garden from without; lush green briony, with green-white\nblossoms, that grows so fast, one could almost think that we see it grow,\nand deadly nightshade, La bella donna, O! so beautiful; red berry, and\npurple, yellow-spiked flower, and deadly, cruel-looking, dark green leaf,\nall growing together in the glorious days of early autumn.  And in the\nmidst of the great garden was a conduit, with its sides carved with\nhistories from the Bible, and there was on it too, as on the fountain in\nthe cloister, much carving of flowers and strange beasts.  Now the Church\nitself was surrounded on every side but the north by the cemetery, and\nthere were many graves there, both of monks and of laymen, and often the\nfriends of those, whose bodies lay there, had planted flowers about the\ngraves of those they loved.  I remember one such particularly, for at the\nhead of it was a cross of carved wood, and at the foot of it, facing the\ncross, three tall sun-flowers; then in the midst of the cemetery was a\ncross of stone, carved on one side with the Crucifixion of our Lord Jesus\nChrist, and on the other with our Lady holding the Divine Child.  So that\nday, that I specially remember, in autumn-tide, when the Church was\nnearly finished, I was carving in the central porch of the west front;\n(for I carved all those bas-reliefs in the west front with my own hand;)\nbeneath me my sister Margaret was carving at the flower-work, and the\nlittle quatrefoils that carry the signs of the zodiac and emblems of the\nmonths: now my sister Margaret was rather more than twenty years old at\nthat time, and she was very beautiful, with dark brown hair and deep calm\nviolet eyes.  I had lived with her all my life, lived with her almost\nalone latterly, for our father and mother died when she was quite young,\nand I loved her very much, though I was not thinking of her just then, as\nshe stood beneath me carving.  Now the central porch was carved with a\nbas-relief of the Last Judgment, and it was divided into three parts by\nhorizontal bands of deep flower-work.  In the lowest division, just over\nthe doors, was carved The Rising of the Dead; above were angels blowing\nlong trumpets, and Michael the Archangel weighing the souls, and the\nblessed led into heaven by angels, and the lost into hell by the devil;\nand in the topmost division was the Judge of the world.\n\nAll the figures in the porch were finished except one, and I remember\nwhen I woke that morning my exultation at the thought of my Church being\nso nearly finished; I remember, too, how a kind of misgiving mingled with\nthe exultation, which, try all I could, I was unable to shake off; I\nthought then it was a rebuke for my pride, well, perhaps it was.  The\nfigure I had to carve was Abraham, sitting with a blossoming tree on each\nside of him, holding in his two hands the corners of his great robe, so\nthat it made a mighty fold, wherein, with their hands crossed over their\nbreasts, were the souls of the faithful, of whom he was called Father: I\nstood on the scaffolding for some time, while Margaret's chisel worked on\nbravely down below.  I took mine in my hand, and stood so, listening to\nthe noise of the masons inside, and two monks of the Abbey came and stood\nbelow me, and a knight, holding his little daughter by the hand, who\nevery now and then looked up at him, and asked him strange questions.  I\ndid not think of these long, but began to think of Abraham, yet I could\nnot think of him sitting there, quiet and solemn, while the\nJudgment-Trumpet was being blown; I rather thought of him as he looked\nwhen he chased those kings so far; riding far ahead of any of his\ncompany, with his mail-hood off his head, and lying in grim folds down\nhis back, with the strong west wind blowing his wild black hair far out\nbehind him, with the wind rippling the long scarlet pennon of his lance;\nriding there amid the rocks and the sands alone; with the last gleam of\nthe armour of the beaten kings disappearing behind the winding of the\npass; with his company a long, long way behind, quite out of sight,\nthough their trumpets sounded faintly among the clefts of the rocks; and\nso I thought I saw him, till in his fierce chase he lept, horse and man,\ninto a deep river, quiet, swift, and smooth; and there was something in\nthe moving of the water-lilies as the breast of the horse swept them\naside, that suddenly took away the thought of Abraham and brought a\nstrange dream of lands I had never seen; and the first was of a place\nwhere I was quite alone, standing by the side of a river, and there was\nthe sound of singing a very long way off, but no living thing of any kind\ncould be seen, and the land was quite flat, quite without hills, and\nquite without trees too, and the river wound very much, making all kinds\nof quaint curves, and on the side where I stood there grew nothing but\nlong grass, but on the other side grew, quite on to the horizon, a great\nsea of red corn-poppies, only paths of white lilies wound all among them,\nwith here and there a great golden sun-flower.  So I looked down at the\nriver by my feet, and saw how blue it was, and how, as the stream went\nswiftly by, it swayed to and fro the long green weeds, and I stood and\nlooked at the river for long, till at last I felt some one touch me on\nthe shoulder, and, looking round, I saw standing by me my friend Amyot,\nwhom I love better than any one else in the world, but I thought in my\ndream that I was frightened when I saw him, for his face had changed so,\nit was so bright and almost transparent, and his eyes gleamed and shone\nas I had never seen them do before.  Oh! he was so wondrously beautiful,\nso fearfully beautiful! and as I looked at him the distant music swelled,\nand seemed to come close up to me, and then swept by us, and fainted\naway, at last died off entirely; and then I felt sick at heart, and\nfaint, and parched, and I stooped to drink of the water of the river, and\nas soon as the water touched my lips, lo! the river vanished, and the\nflat country with its poppies and lilies, and I dreamed that I was in a\nboat by myself again, floating in an almost land-locked bay of the\nnorthern sea, under a cliff of dark basalt.  I was lying on my back in\nthe boat, looking up at the intensely blue sky, and a long low swell from\nthe outer sea lifted the boat up and let it fall again and carried it\ngradually nearer and nearer towards the dark cliff; and as I moved on, I\nsaw at last, on the top of the cliff, a castle, with many towers, and on\nthe highest tower of the castle there was a great white banner floating,\nwith a red chevron on it, and three golden stars on the chevron;\npresently I saw too on one of the towers, growing in a cranny of the worn\nstones, a great bunch of golden and blood-red wall-flowers, and I watched\nthe wall-flowers and banner for long; when suddenly I heard a trumpet\nblow from the castle, and saw a rush of armed men on to the battlements,\nand there was a fierce fight, till at last it was ended, and one went to\nthe banner and pulled it down, and cast it over the cliff in to the sea,\nand it came down in long sweeps, with the wind making little ripples in\nit;--slowly, slowly it came, till at last it fell over me and covered me\nfrom my feet till over my breast, and I let it stay there and looked\nagain at the castle, and then I saw that there was an amber-coloured\nbanner floating over the castle in place of the red chevron, and it was\nmuch larger than the other: also now, a man stood on the battlements,\nlooking towards me; he had a tilting helmet on, with the visor down, and\nan amber-coloured surcoat over his armour: his right hand was\nungauntletted, and he held it high above his head, and in his hand was\nthe bunch of wallflowers that I had seen growing on the wall; and his\nhand was white and small like a woman's, for in my dream I could see even\nvery far-off things much clearer than we see real material things on the\nearth: presently he threw the wallflowers over the cliff, and they fell\nin the boat just behind my head, and then I saw, looking down from the\nbattlements of the castle, Amyot.  He looked down towards me very\nsorrowfully, I thought, but, even as in the other dream, said nothing; so\nI thought in my dream that I wept for very pity, and for love of him, for\nhe looked as a man just risen from a long illness, and who will carry\ntill he dies a dull pain about with him.  He was very thin, and his long\nblack hair drooped all about his face, as he leaned over the battlements\nlooking at me: he was quite pale, and his cheeks were hollow, but his\neyes large, and soft, and sad.  So I reached out my arms to him, and\nsuddenly I was walking with him in a lovely garden, and we said nothing,\nfor the music which I had heard at first was sounding close to us now,\nand there were many birds in the boughs of the trees: oh, such birds!\ngold and ruby, and emerald, but they sung not at all, but were quite\nsilent, as though they too were listening to the music.  Now all this\ntime Amyot and I had been looking at each other, but just then I turned\nmy head away from him, and as soon as I did so, the music ended with a\nlong wail, and when I turned again Amyot was gone; then I felt even more\nsad and sick at heart than I had before when I was by the river, and I\nleaned against a tree, and put my hands before my eyes.  When I looked\nagain the garden was gone, and I knew not where I was, and presently all\nmy dreams were gone.  The chips were flying bravely from the stone under\nmy chisel at last, and all my thoughts now were in my carving, when I\nheard my name, \"Walter,\" called, and when I looked down I saw one\nstanding below me, whom I had seen in my dreams just before--Amyot.  I\nhad no hopes of seeing him for a long time, perhaps I might never see him\nagain, I thought, for he was away (as I thought) fighting in the holy\nwars, and it made me almost beside myself to see him standing close by me\nin the flesh.  I got down from my scaffolding as soon as I could, and all\nthoughts else were soon drowned in the joy of having him by me; Margaret,\ntoo, how glad she must have been, for she had been betrothed to him for\nsome time before he went to the wars, and he had been five years away;\nfive years! and how we had thought of him through those many weary days!\nhow often his face had come before me! his brave, honest face, the most\nbeautiful among all the faces of men and women I have ever seen.  Yes, I\nremember how five years ago I held his hand as we came together out of\nthe cathedral of that great, far-off city, whose name I forget now; and\nthen I remember the stamping of the horses' feet; I remember how his hand\nleft mine at last, and then, some one looking back at me earnestly as\nthey all rode on together--looking back, with his hand on the saddle\nbehind him, while the trumpets sang in long solemn peals as they all rode\non together, with the glimmer of arms and the fluttering of banners, and\nthe clinking of the rings of the mail, that sounded like the falling of\nmany drops of water into the deep, still waters of some pool that the\nrocks nearly meet over; and the gleam and flash of the swords, and the\nglimmer of the lance-heads and the flutter of the rippled banners that\nstreamed out from them, swept past me, and were gone, and they seemed\nlike a pageant in a dream, whose meaning we know not; and those sounds\ntoo, the trumpets, and the clink of the mail, and the thunder of the\nhorse-hoofs, they seemed dream-like too--and it was all like a dream that\nhe should leave me, for we had said that we should always be together;\nbut he went away, and now he is come back again.\n\nWe were by his bed-side, Margaret and I; I stood and leaned over him, and\nmy hair fell sideways over my face and touched his face; Margaret kneeled\nbeside me, quivering in every limb, not with pain, I think, but rather\nshaken by a passion of earnest prayer.  After some time (I know not how\nlong), I looked up from his face to the window underneath which he lay; I\ndo not know what time of the day it was, but I know that it was a\nglorious autumn day, a day soft with melting, golden haze: a vine and a\nrose grew together, and trailed half across the window, so that I could\nnot see much of the beautiful blue sky, and nothing of town or country\nbeyond; the vine leaves were touched with red here and there, and three\nover-blown roses, light pink roses, hung amongst them.  I remember\ndwelling on the strange lines the autumn had made in red on one of the\ngold-green vine leaves, and watching one leaf of one of the over-blown\nroses, expecting it to fall every minute; but as I gazed, and felt\ndisappointed that the rose leaf had not fallen yet, I felt my pain\nsuddenly shoot through me, and I remembered what I had lost; and then\ncame bitter, bitter dreams,--dreams which had once made me happy,--dreams\nof the things I had hoped would be, of the things that would never be\nnow; they came between the fair vine leaves and rose blossoms, and that\nwhich lay before the window; they came as before, perfect in colour and\nform, sweet sounds and shapes.  But now in every one was something\nunutterably miserable; they would not go away, they put out the steady\nglow of the golden haze, the sweet light of the sun through the vine\nleaves, the soft leaning of the full blown roses.  I wandered in them for\na long time; at last I felt a hand put me aside gently, for I was\nstanding at the head of--of the bed; then some one kissed my forehead,\nand words were spoken--I know not what words.  The bitter dreams left me\nfor the bitterer reality at last; for I had found him that morning lying\ndead, only the morning after I had seen him when he had come back from\nhis long absence--I had found him lying dead, with his hands crossed\ndownwards, with his eyes closed, as though the angels had done that for\nhim; and now when I looked at him he still lay there, and Margaret knelt\nby him with her face touching his: she was not quivering now, her lips\nmoved not at all as they had done just before; and so, suddenly those\nwords came to my mind which she had spoken when she kissed me, and which\nat the time I had only heard with my outward hearing, for she had said,\n\"Walter, farewell, and Christ keep you; but for me, I must be with him,\nfor so I promised him last night that I would never leave him any more,\nand God will let me go.\"  And verily Margaret and Amyot did go, and left\nme very lonely and sad.\n\nIt was just beneath the westernmost arch of the nave, there I carved\ntheir tomb: I was a long time carving it; I did not think I should be so\nlong at first, and I said, \"I shall die when I have finished carving it,\"\nthinking that would be a very short time.  But so it happened after I had\ncarved those two whom I loved, lying with clasped hands like husband and\nwife above their tomb, that I could not yet leave carving it; and so that\nI might be near them I became a monk, and used to sit in the choir and\nsing, thinking of the time when we should all be together again.  And as\nI had time I used to go to the westernmost arch of the nave and work at\nthe tomb that was there under the great, sweeping arch; and in process of\ntime I raised a marble canopy that reached quite up to the top of the\narch, and I painted it too as fair as I could, and carved it all about\nwith many flowers and histories, and in them I carved the faces of those\nI had known on earth (for I was not as one on earth now, but seemed quite\naway out of the world).  And as I carved, sometimes the monks and other\npeople too would come and gaze, and watch how the flowers grew; and\nsometimes too as they gazed, they would weep for pity, knowing how all\nhad been.  So my life passed, and I lived in that Abbey for twenty years\nafter he died, till one morning, quite early, when they came into the\nchurch for matins, they found me lying dead, with my chisel in my hand,\nunderneath the last lily of the tomb.\n\n\n\n\nLINDENBORG POOL. {21}\n\n\nI read once in lazy humour Thorpe's _Northern Mythology_ on a cold May\nnight when the north wind was blowing; in lazy humour, but when I came to\nthe tale that is here amplified there was something in it that fixed my\nattention and made me think of it; and whether I would or no, my thoughts\nran in this way, as here follows.\n\nSo I felt obliged to write, and wrote accordingly, and by the time I had\ndone the grey light filled all my room; so I put out my candles, and went\nto bed, not without fear and trembling, for the morning twilight is so\nstrange and lonely.  This is what I wrote.\n\n* * * * *\n\nYes, on that dark night, with that wild unsteady north wind howling,\nthough it was May time, it was doubtless dismal enough in the forest,\nwhere the boughs clashed eerily, and where, as the wanderer in that place\nhurried along, strange forms half showed themselves to him, the more\nfearful because half seen in that way: dismal enough doubtless on wide\nmoors where the great wind had it all its own way: dismal on the rivers\ncreeping on and on between the marsh-lands, creeping through the willows,\nthe water trickling through the locks, sounding faintly in the gusts of\nthe wind.\n\nYet surely nowhere so dismal as by the side of that still pool.\n\nI threw myself down on the ground there, utterly exhausted with my\nstruggle against the wind, and with bearing the fathoms and fathoms of\nthe heavily-leaded plumb-line that lay beside me.\n\nFierce as the rain was, it could not raise the leaden waters of that\nfearful pool, defended as they were by the steep banks of dripping yellow\nclay, striped horribly here and there with ghastly uncertain green and\nblue.\n\nThey said no man could fathom it; and yet all round the edges of it grew\na rank crop of dreary reeds and segs, some round, some flat, but none\never flowering as other things flowered, never dying and being renewed,\nbut always the same stiff array of unbroken reeds and segs, some round,\nsome flat.  Hard by me were two trees leafless and ugly, made, it seemed,\nonly for the wind to go through with a wild sough on such nights as\nthese; and for a mile from that place were no other trees.\n\nTrue, I could not see all this at that time, then, in the dark night, but\nI knew well that it was all there; for much had I studied this pool in\nthe day-time, trying to learn the secret of it; many hours I had spent\nthere, happy with a kind of happiness, because forgetful of the past.  And\neven now, could I not hear the wind going through those trees, as it\nnever went through any trees before or since? could I not see gleams of\nthe dismal moor? could I not hear those reeds just taken by the wind,\nknocking against each other, the flat ones scraping all along the round\nones?  Could I not hear, moreover, the slow trickling of the land-springs\nthrough the clay banks?\n\nThe cold, chill horror of the place was too much for me; I had never been\nthere by night before, nobody had for quite a long time, and now to come\non such a night!  If there had been any moon, the place would have looked\nmore as it did by day; besides, the moon shining on water is always so\nbeautiful, on any water even: if it had been starlight, one could have\nlooked at the stars and thought of the time when those fields were\nfertile and beautiful (for such a time was, I am sure), when the cowslips\ngrew among the grass, and when there was promise of yellow-waving corn\nstained with poppies; that time which the stars had seen, but which we\nhad never seen, which even they would never see again--past time!\n\nAh! what was that which touched my shoulder?--Yes, I see, only a dead\nleaf.--Yes, to be here on this eighth of May too of all nights in the\nyear, the night of that awful day when ten years ago I slew him, not\nundeservedly, God knows, yet how dreadful it was!--Another leaf! and\nanother!--Strange, those trees have been dead this hundred years, I\nshould think.  How sharp the wind is too, just as if I were moving along\nand meeting it;--why, I _am_ moving! what then, I am not there after all;\nwhere am I then? there are the trees; no, they are freshly-planted oak\nsaplings, the very ones that those withered last-year's leaves were blown\non me from.\n\nI have been dreaming then, and am on my road to the lake: but what a\nyoung wood!  I must have lost my way; I never saw all this before.  Well--I\nwill walk on stoutly.\n\nMay the Lord help my senses!  I am _riding_!--on a mule; a bell tinkles\nsomewhere on him; the wind blows something about with a flapping sound:\nsomething? in heaven's name, what?  _My_ long black robes.--Why--when I\nleft my house I was clad in serviceable broadcloth of the nineteenth\ncentury.\n\nI shall go mad--I am mad--I am gone to the devil--I have lost my\nidentity; who knows in what place, in what age of the world I am living\nnow?  Yet I will be calm; I have seen all these things before, in\npictures surely, or something like them.  I am resigned, since it is no\nworse than that.  I am a priest then, in the dim, far-off thirteenth\ncentury, riding, about midnight I should say, to carry the blessed\nSacrament to some dying man.\n\nSoon I found that I was not alone; a man was riding close to me on a\nhorse; he was fantastically dressed, more so than usual for that time,\nbeing striped all over in vertical stripes of yellow and green, with\nquaint birds like exaggerated storks in different attitudes\ncounter-changed on the stripes; all this I saw by the lantern he carried,\nin the light of which his debauched black eyes quite flashed.  On he\nwent, unsteadily rolling, very drunk, though it was the thirteenth\ncentury, but being plainly used to that, he sat his horse fairly well.\n\nI watched him in my proper nineteenth-century character, with insatiable\ncuriosity and intense amusement; but as a quiet priest of a long-past\nage, with contempt and disgust enough, not unmixed with fear and anxiety.\n\nHe roared out snatches of doggrel verse as he went along, drinking songs,\nhunting songs, robbing songs, lust songs, in a voice that sounded far and\nfar above the roaring of the wind, though that was high, and rolled along\nthe dark road that his lantern cast spikes of light along ever so far,\nmaking the devils grin: and meanwhile I, the priest, glanced from him\nwrathfully every now and then to That which I carried very reverently in\nmy hand, and my blood curdled with shame and indignation; but being a\nshrewd priest, I knew well enough that a sermon would be utterly thrown\naway on a man who was drunk every day in the year, and, more especially,\nvery drunk then.  So I held my peace, saying only under my breath:\n\n   \"Dixit incipiens in corde suo, Non est Deus.  Corrupti sunt et\n   abominables facti sunt in studiis suis; non est qui faciat bonum, non\n   est usque ad unum: sepulchrum patens est guttur eorum; linguis suis\n   dolose agebunt, venenum aspidum sub labiis eorum.  Dominum non\n   invocaverunt; illic trepid-averunt timore, ubi non erat timor.  Quis\n   dabit ex Sion salutare Israel?\"\n\nand so I went on, thinking too at times about the man who was dying and\nwhom I was soon to see: he had been a bold bad plundering baron, but was\nsaid lately to have altered his way of life, having seen a miracle or\nsome such thing; he had departed to keep a tournament near his castle\nlately, but had been brought back sore wounded, so this drunken servant,\nwith some difficulty and much unseasonable merriment, had made me\nunderstand, and now lay at the point of death, brought about by unskilful\ntending and such like.  Then I thought of his face--a bad face, very bad,\nretreating forehead, small twinkling eyes, projecting lower jaw; and such\na voice, too, he had! like the grunt of a bear mostly.\n\nNow don't you think it strange that this face should be the same,\nactually the same as the face of my enemy, slain that very day ten years\nago?  I did not hate him, either that man or the baron, but I wanted to\nsee as little of him as possible, and I hoped that the ceremony would\nsoon be over, and that I should be at liberty again.\n\nAnd so with these thoughts and many others, but all thought strangely\ndouble, we went along, the varlet being too drunk to take much notice of\nme, only once, as he was singing some doggrel, like this, I think, making\nallowances for change of language and so forth:\n\n   The Duke went to Treves\n      On the first of November;\n   His wife stay'd at Bonn--\n      Let me see, I remember;\n\n   When the Duke came back\n      To look for his wife,\n   We came from Cologne,\n      And took the Duke's life;\n\n   We hung him mid high\n      Between spire and pavement,\n   From their mouths dropp'd the cabbage\n      Of the carles in amazement.\n\n\"Boo--hoo!  Church rat!  Church mouse!  Hilloa, Priest! have you brought\nthe pyx, eh?\"\n\nFrom some cause or other he seemed to think this an excellent joke, for\nhe almost shrieked with laughter as we went along; but by this time we\nhad reached the castle.  Challenge, and counter-challenge, and we passed\nthe outermost gate and began to go through some of the courts, in which\nstood lime trees here and there, growing green tenderly with that\nMaytime, though the north wind bit so keenly.\n\nHow strange again! as I went farther, there seemed no doubt of it; here\nin the aftertime came that pool, how I knew not; but in the few moments\nthat we were riding from the outer gate to the castle-porch I thought so\nintensely over the probable cause for the existence of that pool, that\n(how strange!) I could almost have thought I was back again listening to\nthe oozing of the land-springs through the high clay banks there.  I was\nwakened from that before it grew too strong, by the glare of many\ntorches, and, dismounting, found myself in the midst of some twenty\nattendants, with flushed faces and wildly sparkling eyes, which they were\nvainly trying to soften to due solemnity; mock solemnity I had almost\nsaid, for they did not seem to think it necessary to appear really\nsolemn, and had difficulty enough apparently in not prolonging\nindefinitely the shout of laughter with which they had at first greeted\nme.  \"Take the holy Father to my Lord,\" said one at last, \"and we will go\nwith him.\"\n\nSo they led me up the stairs into the gorgeously-furnished chamber; the\nlight from the heavy waxen candles was pleasant to my eyes after the\nglare and twisted red smoke of the pine-torches; but all the essences\nscattered about the chamber were not enough to conquer the fiery breath\nof those about me.\n\nI put on the alb and stole they brought me, and, before I went up to the\nsick man, looked round on those that were in the rooms; for the rooms\nopened one into the other by many doors, across some of which hung\ngorgeous tapestry; all the rooms seemed to have many people, for some\nstood at these doors, and some passed to and fro, swinging aside the\nheavy hangings; once several people at once, seemingly quite by accident,\ndrew aside almost all the veils from the doors, and showed an endless\nperspective of gorgeousness.\n\nAnd at these things my heart fainted for horror.  \"Had not the Jews of\nlate,\" thought I, the priest, \"been very much in the habit of crucifying\nchildren in mockery of the Holiest, holding gorgeous feasts while they\nbeheld the poor innocents die?  These men are Atheists, you are in a\ntrap, yet quit yourself like a man.\"\n\n\"Ah, sharp one,\" thought I, the author, \"where are you at last? try to\npray as a test.--Well, well, these things are strangely like devils.--O\nman, you have talked about bravery often, now is your time to practise\nit: once for all trust in God, or I fear you are lost.\"\n\nMoreover it increased my horror that there was no appearance of a woman\nin all these rooms; and yet was there not? there, those things--I looked\nmore intently; yes, no doubt they were women, but all dressed like\nmen;--what a ghastly place!\n\n\"O man! do your duty,\" my angel said; then in spite of the bloodshot eyes\nof man and woman there, in spite of their bold looks, they quailed before\nme.\n\nI stepped up to the bed-side, where under the velvet coverlid lay the\ndying man, his small sparkling eyes only (but dulled now by coming death)\nshowing above the swathings.  I was about to kneel down by the bed-side\nto confess him, when one of those--things--called out (now they had just\nbeen whispering and sniggering together, but the priest in his righteous,\nbrave scorn would not look at them; the humbled author, half fearful,\nhalf trustful, dared not) so one called out:\n\n\"Sir Priest, for three days our master has spoken no articulate word; you\nmust pass over all particulars; ask for a sign only.\"\n\nSuch a strange ghastly suspicion flashed across me just then; but I\nchoked it, and asked the dying man if he repented of his sins, and if he\nbelieved all that was necessary to salvation, and, if so, to make a sign,\nif he were able: the man moved a little and groaned; so I took it for a\nsign, as he was clearly incapable either of speaking or moving, and\naccordingly began the service for the administration of the sacraments;\nand as I began, those behind me and through all the rooms (I know it was\nthrough all of them) began to move about, in a bewildering dance-like\nmotion, mazy and intricate; yes, and presently music struck up through\nall those rooms, music and singing, lively and gay; many of the tunes I\nhad heard before (in the nineteenth century) I could have sworn to half a\ndozen of the polkas.\n\nThe rooms grew fuller and fuller of people; they passed thick and fast\nbetween the rooms, and the hangings were continually rustling; one fat\nold man with a big belly crept under the bed where I was, and wheezed and\nchuckled there, laughing and talking to one who stooped down and lifted\nup the hangings to look at him.\n\nStill more and more people talking and singing and laughing and twirling\nabout, till my brain went round and round, and I scarce knew what I did;\nyet, somehow, I could not leave off; I dared not even look over my\nshoulder, fearing lest I should see something so horrible as to make me\ndie.\n\nSo I got on with the service, and at last took the pyx, and took thereout\nthe sacred wafer, whereupon was a deep silence through all those rooms,\nwhich troubled me, I think, more than all which had gone before, for I\nknew well it did not mean reverence.\n\nI held It up, that which I counted so holy, when lo! great laughter,\nechoing like thunder-claps through all the rooms, not dulled by the\nveiling hangings, for they were all raised up together, and, with a slow\nupheaval of the rich clothes among which he lay, with a sound that was\nhalf snarl, half grunt, with a helpless body swathed in bedclothes, a\nhuge _swine_ that I had been shriving tore from me the Holy Thing, deeply\nscoring my hand as he did so with tusk and tooth, so that the red blood\nran quick on to the floor.\n\nTherewithall he rolled down on to the floor, and lay there helplessly,\nonly able to roll to and fro, because of the swathings.\n\nThen right madly skirled the intolerable laughter, rising to shrieks that\nwere fearfuller than any scream of agony I ever heard; the hundreds of\npeople through all those grand rooms danced and wheeled about me,\nshrieking, hemming me in with interlaced arms, the women loosing their\nlong hair and thrusting forward their horribly-grinning unsexed faces\ntoward me till I felt their hot breath.\n\nOh! how I hated them all! almost hated all mankind for their sakes; how I\nlonged to get right quit of all men; among whom, as it seemed, all\nsacredest things even were made a mock of.  I looked about me fiercely, I\nsprang forward, and clutched a sword from the gilded belt of one of those\nwho stood near me; with savage blows that threw the blood about the\ngilded walls and their hangings right over the heads of those--things--I\ncleared myself from them, and tore down the great stairs madly, yet could\nnot, as in a dream, go fast enough, because of my passion.\n\nI was out in the courtyard, among the lime trees soon, the north wind\nblowing freshly on my heated forehead in that dawn.  The outer gate was\nlocked and bolted; I stooped and raised a great stone and sent it at the\nlock with all my strength, and I was stronger than ten men then; iron and\noak gave way before it, and through the ragged splinters I tore in\nreckless fury, like a wild horse through a hazel hedge.\n\nAnd no one had pursued me.  I knelt down on the dear green turf outside,\nand thanked God with streaming eyes for my deliverance, praying him\nforgiveness for my unwilling share in that night's mockery.\n\nThen I arose and turned to go, but even as I did so I heard a roar as if\nthe world were coming in two, and looking toward the castle, saw, not a\ncastle, but a great cloud of white lime-dust swaying this way and that in\nthe gusts of the wind.\n\nThen while the east grew bright there arose a hissing, gurgling noise,\nthat swelled into the roar and wash of many waters, and by then the sun\nhad risen a deep black lake lay before my feet.\n\n* * * * *\n\nAnd this is how I tried to fathom the Lindenborg Pool.\n\n* * * * *\n\n   _No memory labours longer, from the deep_\n      _Gold mines of thought to lift the hidden ore_\n   _That glimpses, moving up, than I from sleep_\n         _To gather and tell o'er_\n         _Each little sound and sight_.\n\n\n\n\nA DREAM.\n\n\nI dreamed once, that four men sat by the winter fire talking and telling\ntales, in a house that the wind howled round.\n\nAnd one of them, the eldest, said: \"When I was a boy, before you came to\nthis land, that bar of red sand rock, which makes a fall in our river,\nhad only just been formed; for it used to stand above the river in a\ngreat cliff, tunnelled by a cave about midway between the green-growing\ngrass and the green-flowing river; and it fell one night, when you had\nnot yet come to this land, no, nor your fathers.\n\n\"Now, concerning this cliff, or pike rather (for it was a tall slip of\nrock and not part of a range), many strange tales were told; and my\nfather used to say, that in his time many would have explored that cave,\neither from covetousness (expecting to find gold therein ), or from that\nlove of wonders which most young men have, but fear kept them back.\nWithin the memory of man, however, some had entered, and, so men said,\nwere never seen on earth again; but my father said that the tales told\nconcerning such, very far from deterring him (then quite a youth) from\nthe quest of this cavern, made him all the more earnestly long to go; so\nthat one day in his fear, my grandfather, to prevent him, stabbed him in\nthe shoulder, so that he was obliged to keep his bed for long; and\nsomehow he never went, and died at last without ever having seen the\ninside of the cavern.\n\n\"My father told me many wondrous tales about the place, whereof for a\nlong time I have been able to remember nothing; yet, by some means or\nanother, a certain story has grown up in my heart, which I will tell you\nsomething of; a story which no living creature ever told me, though I do\nnot remember the time when I knew it not.  Yes, I will tell you some of\nit, not all perhaps, but as much as I am allowed to tell.\"\n\nThe man stopped and pondered awhile, leaning over the fire where the\nflames slept under the caked coal: he was an old man, and his hair was\nquite white.  He spoke again presently.  \"And I have fancied sometimes,\nthat in some way, how I know not, I am mixed up with the strange story I\nam going to tell you.\"  Again he ceased, and gazed at the fire, bending\nhis head down till his beard touched his knees; then, rousing himself,\nsaid in a changed voice (for he had been speaking dreamily hitherto):\n\"That strange-looking old house that you all know, with the limes and yew-\ntrees before it, and the double line of very old yew-trees leading up\nfrom the gateway-tower to the porch--you know how no one will live there\nnow because it is so eerie, and how even that bold bad lord that would\ncome there, with his turbulent followers, was driven out in shame and\ndisgrace by invisible agency.  Well, in times past there dwelt in that\nhouse an old grey man, who was lord of that estate, his only daughter,\nand a young man, a kind of distant cousin of the house, whom the lord had\nbrought up from a boy, as he was the orphan of a kinsman who had fallen\nin combat in his quarrel.  Now, as the young knight and the young lady\nwere both beautiful and brave, and loved beauty and good things ardently,\nit was natural enough that they should discover as they grew up that they\nwere in love with one another; and afterwards, as they went on loving one\nanother, it was, alas! not unnatural that they should sometimes have half-\nquarrels, very few and far between indeed, and slight to lookers-on, even\nwhile they lasted, but nevertheless intensely bitter and unhappy to the\nprincipal parties thereto.  I suppose their love then, whatever it has\ngrown to since, was not so all-absorbing as to merge all differences of\nopinion and feeling, for again there were such differences then.  So,\nupon a time it happened, just when a great war had arisen, and Lawrence\n(for that was the knight's name) was sitting, and thinking of war, and\nhis departure from home; sitting there in a very grave, almost a stern\nmood, that Ella, his betrothed, came in, gay and sprightly, in a humour\nthat Lawrence often enough could little understand, and this time liked\nless than ever, yet the bare sight of her made him yearn for her full\nheart, which he was not to have yet; so he caught her by the hand, and\ntried to draw her down to him, but she let her hand lie loose in his, and\ndid not answer the pressure in which his heart flowed to hers; then he\narose and stood before her, face to face, but she drew back a little, yet\nhe kissed her on the mouth and said, though a rising in his throat almost\nchoked his voice, 'Ella, are you sorry I am going?'  'Yea,' she said,\n'and nay, for you will shout my name among the sword flashes, and you\nwill fight for me.'  'Yes,' he said, 'for love and duty, dearest.'  'For\nduty? ah! I think, Lawrence, if it were not for me, you would stay at\nhome and watch the clouds, or sit under the linden trees singing dismal\nlove ditties of your own making, dear knight: truly, if you turn out a\ngreat warrior, I too shall live in fame, for I am certainly the making of\nyour desire to fight.'  He let drop his hands from her shoulders, where\nhe had laid them, and said, with a faint flush over his face, 'You wrong\nme, Ella, for, though I have never wished to fight for the mere love of\nfighting, and though,' (and here again he flushed a little) 'and though I\nam not, I well know, so free of the fear of death as a good man would be,\nyet for this duty's sake, which is really a higher love, Ella, love of\nGod, I trust I would risk life, nay honour, even if not willingly, yet\ncheerfully at least.'  'Still duty, duty,' she said; 'you lay, Lawrence,\nas many people do, most stress on the point where you are weakest;\nmoreover, those knights who in time past have done wild, mad things\nmerely at their ladies' word, scarcely did so for duty; for they owed\ntheir lives to their country surely, to the cause of good, and should not\nhave risked them for a whim, and yet you praised them the other day.'\n'Did I?' said Lawrence; 'well, in a way they were much to be praised, for\neven blind love and obedience is well; but reasonable love, reasonable\nobedience is so far better as to be almost a different thing; yet, I\nthink, if the knights did well partly, the ladies did altogether ill: for\nif they had faith in their lovers, and did this merely from a mad longing\nto see them do 'noble' deeds, then they had but little faith in God, Who\ncan, and at His good pleasure does give time and opportunity to every\nman, if he will but watch for it, to serve Him with reasonable service,\nand gain love and all noble things in greater measure thereby: but if\nthese ladies did as they did, that they might prove their knights, then\nsurely did they lack faith both in God and man.  I do not think that two\nfriends even could live together on such terms, but for lovers,--ah!\nElla, Ella, why do you look so at me? on this day, almost the last, we\nshall be together for long; Ella, your face is changed, your eyes--O\nChrist! help her and me, help her, good Lord.'  'Lawrence,' she said,\nspeaking quickly and in jerks, 'dare you, for my sake, sleep this night\nin the cavern of the red pike? for I say to you that, faithful or not, I\ndoubt your courage.'  But she was startled when she saw him, and how the\nfiery blood rushed up to his forehead, then sank to his heart again, and\nhis face became as pale as the face of a dead man; he looked at her and\nsaid, 'Yes, Ella, I will go now; for what matter where I go?'  He turned\nand moved toward the door; he was almost gone, when that evil spirit left\nher, and she cried out aloud, passionately, eagerly: 'Lawrence, Lawrence,\ncome back once more, if only to strike me dead with your knightly sword.'\nHe hesitated, wavered, turned, and in another moment she was lying in his\narms weeping into his hair.\n\n\"'And yet, Ella, the spoken word, the thought of our hearts cannot be\nrecalled, I must go, and go this night too, only promise one thing.'\n'Dearest, what? you are always right!'  'Love, you must promise that if I\ncome not again by to-morrow at moonrise, you will go to the red pike,\nand, having entered the cavern, go where God leads you, and seek me, and\nnever leave that quest, even if it end not but with death.'  'Lawrence,\nhow your heart beats! poor heart! are you afraid that I shall hesitate to\npromise to perform that which is the only thing I could do?  I know I am\nnot worthy to be with you, yet I must be with you in body or soul, or\nbody and soul will die.'  They sat silent, and the birds sang in the\ngarden of lilies beyond; then said Ella again: 'Moreover, let us pray God\nto give us longer life, so that if our natural lives are short for the\naccomplishment of this quest, we may have more, yea, even many more\nlives.'  'He will, my Ella,' said Lawrence, 'and I think, nay, am sure\nthat our wish will be granted; and I, too, will add a prayer, but will\nask it very humbly, namely, that he will give me another chance or more\nto fight in His cause, another life to live instead of this failure.'\n'Let us pray too that we may meet, however long the time be before our\nmeeting,' she said; so they knelt down and prayed, hand fast locked in\nhand meantime; and afterwards they sat in that chamber facing the east,\nhard by the garden of lilies; and the sun fell from his noontide light\ngradually, lengthening the shadows, and when he sank below the sky-line\nall the sky was faint, tender, crimson on a ground of blue; the crimson\nfaded too, and the moon began to rise, but when her golden rim first\nshowed over the wooded hills, Lawrence arose; they kissed one long\ntrembling kiss, and then he went and armed himself; and their lips did\nnot meet again after that, for such a long, long time, so many weary\nyears; for he had said: 'Ella, watch me from the porch, but touch me not\nagain at this time; only, when the moon shows level with the lily-heads,\ngo into the porch and watch me from thence.'\n\n\"And he was gone;--you might have heard her heart beating while the moon\nvery slowly rose, till it shone through the rose-covered trellises, level\nwith the lily-heads; then she went to the porch and stood there,--\n\n\"And she saw him walking down toward the gateway-tower, clad in his mail-\ncoat, with a bright, crestless helmet on his head, and his trenchant\nsword newly grinded, girt to his side; and she watched him going between\nthe yew-trees, which began to throw shadows from the shining of the\nharvest moon.  She stood there in the porch, and round by the corners of\nthe eaves of it looked down towards her and the inside of the porch two\nserpent-dragons, carved in stone; and on their scales, and about their\nleering eyes, grew the yellow lichen; she shuddered as she saw them stare\nat her, and drew closer toward the half-open door; she, standing there,\nclothed in white from her throat till over her feet, altogether\nungirdled; and her long yellow hair, without plait or band, fell down\nbehind and lay along her shoulders, quietly, because the night was\nwithout wind, and she too was now standing scarcely moving a muscle.\n\n\"She gazed down the line of the yew-trees, and watched how, as he went\nfor the most part with a firm step, he yet shrank somewhat from the\nshadows of the yews; his long brown hair flowing downward, swayed with\nhim as he walked; and the golden threads interwoven with it, as the\nfashion was with the warriors in those days, sparkled out from among it\nnow and then; and the faint, far-off moonlight lit up the waves of his\nmail-coat; he walked fast, and was disappearing in the shadows of the\ntrees near the moat, but turned before he was quite lost in them, and\nwaved his ungauntletted hand; then she heard the challenge of the warder,\nthe falling of the drawbridge, the swing of the heavy wicket-gate on its\nhinges; and, into the brightening lights, and deepening shadows of the\nmoonlight he went from her sight; and she left the porch and went to the\nchapel, all that night praying earnestly there.\n\n\"But he came not back again all the next day, and Ella wandered about\nthat house pale, and fretting her heart away; so when night came and the\nmoon, she arrayed herself in that same raiment that she had worn on the\nnight before, and went toward the river and the red pike.\n\n\"The broad moon shone right over it by the time she came to the river;\nthe pike rose up from the other side, and she thought at first that she\nwould have to go back again, cross over the bridge, and so get to it;\nbut, glancing down on the river just as she turned, she saw a little boat\nfairly gilt and painted, and with a long slender paddle in it, lying on\nthe water, stretching out its silken painter as the stream drew it\ndownwards, she entered it, and taking the paddle made for the other side;\nthe moon meanwhile turning the eddies to silver over the dark green\nwater: she landed beneath the shadow of that great pile of sandstone,\nwhere the grass grew green, and the flowers sprung fair right up to the\nfoot of the bare barren rock; it was cut in many steps till it reached\nthe cave, which was overhung by creepers and matted grass; the stream\nswept the boat downwards, and Ella, her heart beating so as almost to\nstop her breath, mounted the steps slowly, slowly.  She reached at last\nthe platform below the cave, and turning, gave a long gaze at the moonlit\ncountry; 'her last,' she said; then she moved, and the cave hid her as\nthe water of the warm seas close over the pearl-diver.\n\n\"Just so the night before had it hidden Lawrence.  And they never came\nback, they two:--never, the people say.  I wonder what their love has\ngrown to now; ah! they love, I know, but cannot find each other yet, I\nwonder also if they ever will.\"\n\nSo spoke Hugh the white-haired.  But he who sat over against him, a\nsoldier as it seemed, black-bearded, with wild grey eyes that his great\nbrows hung over far; he, while the others sat still, awed by some vague\nsense of spirits being very near them; this man, Giles, cried out--\"Never?\nold Hugh, it is not so.--Speak!  I cannot tell you how it happened, but I\nknow it was not so, not so:--speak quick, Hugh! tell us all, all!\"\n\n\"Wait a little, my son, wait,\" said Hugh; \"the people indeed said they\nnever came back again at all, but I, but I--Ah! the time is long past\nover.\"  So he was silent, and sank his head on his breast, though his old\nthin lips moved, as if he talked softly to himself, and the light of past\ndays flickered in his eyes.\n\nMeanwhile Giles sat with his hands clasped finger over finger, tightly,\n\"till the knuckles whitened;\" his lips were pressed firmly together; his\nbreast heaved as though it would burst, as though it must be rid of its\nsecret.  Suddenly he sprang up, and in a voice that was a solemn chant,\nbegan: \"In full daylight, long ago, on a slumberously-wrathful,\nthunderous afternoon of summer;\"--then across his chant ran the old man's\nshrill voice: \"On an October day, packed close with heavy-lying mist,\nwhich was more than mere autumn-mist:\"--the solemn stately chanting\ndropped, the shrill voice went on; Giles sank down again, and Hugh\nstanding there, swaying to and fro to the measured ringing of his own\nshrill voice, his long beard moving with him, said:--\n\n\"On such a day, warm, and stifling so that one could scarcely breathe\neven down by the sea-shore, I went from bed to bed in the hospital of the\npest-laden city with my soothing draughts and medicines.  And there went\nwith me a holy woman, her face pale with much watching; yet I think even\nwithout those same desolate lonely watchings her face would still have\nbeen pale.  She was not beautiful, her face being somewhat\npeevish-looking; apt, she seemed, to be made angry by trifles, and, even\non her errand of mercy, she spoke roughly to those she tended:--no, she\nwas not beautiful, yet I could not help gazing at her, for her eyes were\nvery beautiful and looked out from her ugly face as a fair maiden might\nlook from a grim prison between the window-bars of it.\n\n\"So, going through that hospital, I came to a bed at last, whereon lay\none who had not been struck down by fever or plague, but had been smitten\nthrough the body with a sword by certain robbers, so that he had narrowly\nescaped death.  Huge of frame, with stern suffering face he lay there;\nand I came to him, and asked him of his hurt, and how he fared, while the\nday grew slowly toward even, in that pest-chamber looking toward the\nwest; the sister came to him soon and knelt down by his bed-side to tend\nhim.\n\n\"O Christ!  As the sun went down on that dim misty day, the clouds and\nthe thickly-packed mist cleared off, to let him shine on us, on that\nchamber of woes and bitter unpurifying tears; and the sunlight wrapped\nthose two, the sick man and the ministering woman, shone on them--changed,\nchanged utterly.  Good Lord!  How was I struck dumb, nay, almost blinded\nby that change; for there--yes there, while no man but I wondered; there,\ninstead of the unloving nurse, knelt a wonderfully beautiful maiden,\nclothed all in white, and with long golden hair down her back.  Tenderly\nshe gazed at the wounded man, as her hands were put about his head,\nlifting it up from the pillow but a very little; and he no longer the\ngrim, strong wounded man, but fair, and in the first bloom of youth; a\nbright polished helmet crowned his head, a mail-coat flowed over his\nbreast, and his hair streamed down long from his head, while from among\nit here and there shone out threads of gold.\n\n\"So they spake thus in a quiet tone: 'Body and soul together again, Ella,\nlove; how long will it be now before the last time of all?'  'Long,' she\nsaid, 'but the years pass; talk no more, dearest, but let us think only,\nfor the time is short, and our bodies call up memories, change love to\nbetter even than it was in the old time.'\n\n\"Silence so, while you might count a hundred, then with a great sigh:\n'Farewell, Ella, for long,'--'Farewell, Lawrence,' and the sun sank, all\nwas as before.\n\n\"But I stood at the foot of the bed pondering, till the sister coming to\nme, said: 'Master Physician, this is no time for dreaming; act--the\npatients are waiting, the fell sickness grows worse in this hot close\nair; feel'--(and she swung open the casement), 'the outer air is no\nfresher than the air inside; the wind blows dead toward the west, coming\nfrom the stagnant marshes; the sea is like a stagnant pool too, you can\nscarce hear the sound of the long, low surge breaking.'  I turned from\nher and went up to the sick man, and said: 'Sir Knight, in spite of all\nthe sickness about you, you yourself better strangely, and another month\nwill see you with your sword girt to your side again.'  'Thanks, kind\nmaster Hugh,' he said, but impatiently, as if his mind were on other\nthings, and he turned in his bed away from me restlessly.\n\n\"And till late that night I ministered to the sick in that hospital; but\nwhen I went away, I walked down to the sea, and paced there to and fro\nover the hard sand: and the moon showed bloody with the hot mist, which\nthe sea would not take on its bosom, though the dull east wind blew it\nonward continually.  I walked there pondering till a noise from over the\nsea made me turn and look that way; what was that coming over the sea?\nLaus Deo! the WEST WIND: Hurrah!  I feel the joy I felt then over again\nnow, in all its intensity.  How came it over the sea? first, far out to\nsea, so that it was only just visible under the red-gleaming moonlight,\nfar out to sea, while the mists above grew troubled, and wavered, a long\nlevel bar of white; it grew nearer quickly, it gathered form, strange,\nmisty, intricate form--the ravelled foam of the green sea; then oh!\nhurrah! I was wrapped in it,--the cold salt spray--drenched with it,\nblinded by it, and when I could see again, I saw the great green waves\nrising, nodding and breaking, all coming on together; and over them from\nwave to wave leaped the joyous WEST WIND; and the mist and the plague\nclouds were sweeping back eastward in wild swirls; and right away were\nthey swept at last, till they brooded over the face of the dismal\nstagnant meres, many miles away from our fair city, and there they\npondered wrathfully on their defeat.\n\n\"But somehow my life changed from the time when I beheld the two lovers,\nand I grew old quickly.\"  He ceased; then after a short silence said\nagain: \"And that was long ago, very long ago, I know not when it\nhappened.\"  So he sank back again, and for a while no one spoke; till\nGiles said at last:\n\n\"Once in full daylight I saw a vision, while I was waking, while the eyes\nof men were upon me; long ago on the afternoon of a thunderous summer\nday, I sat alone in my fair garden near the city; for on that day a\nmighty reward was to be given to the brave man who had saved us all,\nleading us so mightily in that battle a few days back; now the very\nqueen, the lady of the land, whom all men reverenced almost as the Virgin\nMother, so kind and good and beautiful she was, was to crown him with\nflowers and gird a sword about him; after the 'Te Deum' had been sung for\nthe victory, and almost all the city were at that time either in the\nChurch, or hard by it, or else were by the hill that was near the river\nwhere the crowning was to be: but I sat alone in the garden of my house\nas I said; sat grieving for the loss of my brave brother, who was slain\nby my side in that same fight.  I sat beneath an elm tree; and as I sat\nand pondered on that still, windless day, I heard suddenly a breath of\nair rustle through the boughs of the elm.  I looked up, and my heart\nalmost stopped beating, I knew not why, as I watched the path of that\nbreeze over the bowing lilies and the rushes by the fountain; but when I\nlooked to the place whence the breeze had come, I became all at once\naware of an appearance that told me why my heart stopped beating.  Ah!\nthere they were, those two whom before I had but seen in dreams by night,\nnow before my waking eyes in broad daylight.  One, a knight (for so he\nseemed), with long hair mingled with golden threads, flowing over his\nmail-coat, and a bright crestless helmet on his head, his face\nsad-looking, but calm; and by his side, but not touching him, walked a\nwondrously fair maiden, clad in white, her eyelids just shadowing her\nblue eyes: her arms and hands seeming to float along with her as she\nmoved on quickly, yet very softly; great rest on them both, though sorrow\ngleamed through it.\n\n\"When they came opposite to where I stood, these two stopped for a while,\nbeing in nowise shadowy, as I have heard men say ghosts are, but clear\nand distinct.  They stopped close by me, as I stood motionless, unable to\npray; they turned to each other, face to face, and the maiden said,\n'Love, for this our last true meeting before the end of all, we need a\nwitness; let this man, softened by sorrow, even as we are, go with us.'\n\n\"I never heard such music as her words were; though I used to wonder when\nI was young whether the angels in heaven sung better than the choiresters\nsang in our church, and though, even then the sound of the triumphant\nhymn came up to me in a breath of wind, and floated round me, making\ndreams, in that moment of awe and great dread, of the old long-past days\nin that old church, of her who lay under the pavement of it; whose sweet\nvoice once, once long ago, once only to me--yet I shall see her again.\"\nHe became silent as he said this, and no man cared to break in upon his\nthoughts, seeing the choking movement in his throat, the fierce clenching\nof hand and foot, the stiffening of the muscles all over him; but soon,\nwith an upward jerk of his head, he threw back the long elf locks that\nhad fallen over his eyes while his head was bent down, and went on as\nbefore:\n\n\"The knight passed his hand across his brow, as if to clear away some\nmist that had gathered there, and said, in a deep murmurous voice, 'Why\nthe last time, dearest, why the last time?  Know you not how long a time\nremains yet? the old man came last night to the ivory house and told me\nit would be a hundred years, ay, more, before the happy end.'  'So long,'\nshe said; 'so long: ah! love, what things words are; yet this is the last\ntime; alas! alas! for the weary years! my words, my sin!'  'O love, it is\nvery terrible,' he said; 'I could almost weep, old though I am, and grown\ncold with dwelling in the ivory house: O, Ella, if you only knew how cold\nit is there, in the starry nights when the north wind is stirring; and\nthere is no fair colour there, nought but the white ivory, with one\nnarrow line of gleaming gold over every window, and a fathom's-breadth of\nburnished gold behind the throne.  Ella, it was scarce well done of you\nto send me to the ivory house.'  'Is it so cold, love?' she said, 'I knew\nit not; forgive me! but as to the matter of a witness, some one we must\nhave, and why not this man?'  'Rather old Hugh,' he said, 'or Cuthbert,\nhis father; they have both been witnesses before.'  'Cuthbert,' said the\nmaiden, solemnly, 'has been dead twenty years; Hugh died last night.'\"\n(Now, as Giles said these words, carelessly, as though not heeding them\nparticularly, a cold sickening shudder ran through the other two men, but\nhe noted it not and went on.)  \"'This man then be it,' said the knight,\nand therewith they turned again, and moved on side by side as before; nor\nsaid they any word to me, and yet I could not help following them, and we\nthree moved on together, and soon I saw that my nature was changed, and\nthat I was invisible for the time; for, though the sun was high, I cast\nno shadow, neither did any man that we past notice us, as we made toward\nthe hill by the riverside.\n\n\"And by the time we came there the queen was sitting at the top of it,\nunder a throne of purple and gold, with a great band of knights\ngloriously armed on either side of her; and their many banners floated\nover them.  Then I felt that those two had left me, and that my own right\nvisible nature was returned; yet still did I feel strange, and as if I\nbelonged not wholly to this earth.  And I heard one say, in a low voice\nto his fellow, 'See, sir Giles is here after all; yet, how came he here,\nand why is he not in armour among the noble knights yonder, he who fought\nso well? how wild he looks too!'  'Poor knight,' said the other, 'he is\ndistraught with the loss of his brother; let him be; and see, here comes\nthe noble stranger knight, our deliverer.'  As he spoke, we heard a great\nsound of trumpets, and therewithall a long line of knights on foot wound\nup the hill towards the throne, and the queen rose up, and the people\nshouted; and, at the end of all the procession went slowly and\nmajestically the stranger knight; a man of noble presence he was, calm,\nand graceful to look on; grandly he went amid the gleaming of their\ngolden armour; himself clad in the rent mail and tattered surcoat he had\nworn on the battle-day; bareheaded, too; for, in that fierce fight, in\nthe thickest of it, just where he rallied our men, one smote off his\nhelmet, and another, coming from behind, would have slain him, but that\nmy lance bit into his breast.\n\n\"So, when they had come within some twenty paces of the throne, the rest\nhalted, and he went up by himself toward the queen; and she, taking the\ngolden hilted sword in her left hand, with her right caught him by the\nwrist, when he would have knelt to her, and held him so, tremblingly, and\ncried out, 'No, no, thou noblest of all knights, kneel not to me; have we\nnot heard of thee even before thou camest hither? how many widows bless\nthee, how many orphans pray for thee, how many happy ones that would be\nwidows and orphans but for thee, sing to their children, sing to their\nsisters, of thy flashing sword, and the heart that guides it!  And now, O\nnoble one! thou hast done the very noblest deed of all, for thou hast\nkept grown men from weeping shameful tears!  O truly, the greatest I can\ndo for thee is very little; yet, see this sword, golden-hilted, and the\nstones flash out from it,' (then she hung it round him), 'and see this\nwreath of lilies and roses for thy head; lilies no whiter than thy pure\nheart, roses no tenderer than thy true love; and here, before all these\nmy subjects, I fold thee, noblest, in my arms, so, so.'  Ay, truly it was\nstrange enough! those two were together again; not the queen and the\nstranger knight, but the young-seeming knight and the maiden I had seen\nin the garden.  To my eyes they clung together there; though they say,\nthat to the eyes of all else, it was but for a moment that the queen held\nboth his hands in hers; to me also, amid the shouting of the multitude,\ncame an under current of happy song: 'Oh! truly, very truly, my noblest,\na hundred years will not be long after this.'  'Hush, Ella, dearest, for\ntalking makes the time speed; think only.'\n\n\"Pressed close to each other, as I saw it, their bosoms heaved--but I\nlooked away--alas! when I looked again, I saw nought but the stately\nstranger knight, descending, hand in hand, with the queen, flushed with\njoy and triumph, and the people scattering flowers before them.\n\n\"And that was long ago, very long ago.\"  So he ceased; then Osric, one of\nthe two younger men, who had been sitting in awe-struck silence all this\ntime, said, with eyes that dared not meet Giles's, in a terrified half\nwhisper, as though he meant not to speak, \"How long?\"  Giles turned round\nand looked him full in the face, till he dragged his eyes up to his own,\nthen said, \"More than a hundred years ago.\"\n\nSo they all sat silent, listening to the roar of the south-west wind; and\nit blew the windows so, that they rocked in their frames.\n\nThen suddenly, as they sat thus, came a knock at the door of the house;\nso Hugh bowed his head to Osric, to signify that he should go and open\nthe door; so he arose, trembling, and went.\n\nAnd as he opened the door the wind blew hard against him, and blew\nsomething white against his face, then blew it away again, and his face\nwas blanched, even to his lips; but he plucking up heart of grace, looked\nout, and there he saw, standing with her face upturned in speech to him,\na wonderfully beautiful woman, clothed from her throat till over her feet\nin long white raiment, ungirt, unbroidered, and with a veil, that was\nthrown off from her face, and hung from her head, streaming out in the\nblast of the wind: which veil was what had struck against his face:\nbeneath her veil her golden hair streamed out too, and with the veil, so\nthat it touched his face now and then.  She was very fair, but she did\nnot look young either, because of her statue-like features.  She spoke to\nhim slowly and queenly; \"I pray you give me shelter in your house for an\nhour, that I may rest, and so go on my journey again.\"  He was too much\nterrified to answer in words, and so only bowed his head: and she swept\npast him in stately wise to the room where the others sat, and he\nfollowed her, trembling.\n\nA cold shiver ran through the other men when she entered and bowed low to\nthem, and they turned deadly pale, but dared not move; and there she sat\nwhile they gazed at her, sitting there and wondering at her beauty, which\nseemed to grow every minute; though she was plainly not young, oh no, but\nrather very, very old, who could say how old? there she sat, and her\nlong, long hair swept down in one curve from her head and just touched\nthe floor.  Her face had the tokens of a deep sorrow on it, ah! a mighty\nsorrow, yet not so mighty as that it might mar her ineffable loveliness;\nthat sorrow-mark seemed to gather too, and at last the gloriously-slow\nmusic of her words flowed from her lips: \"Friends, has one with the\nappearance of a youth come here lately; one with long brown hair,\ninterwoven with threads of gold, flowing down from out his polished steel\nhelmet; with dark blue eyes and high white forehead, and mail-coat over\nhis breast, where the light and shadow lie in waves as he moves; have you\nseen such an one, very beautiful?\"\n\nThen withall as they shook their heads fearfully in answer, a great sigh\nrose up from her heart, and she said: \"Then must I go away again\npresently, and yet I thought it was the last night of all.\"\n\nAnd so she sat awhile with her head resting on her hand; after, she arose\nas if about to go, and turned her glorious head round to thank the master\nof the house; and they, strangely enough, though they were terrified at\nher presence, were yet grieved when they saw that she was going.\n\nJust then the wind rose higher than ever before, yet through the roar of\nit they could all hear plainly a knocking at the door again; so the lady\nstopped when she heard it, and, turning, looked full in the face of\nHerman the youngest, who thereupon, being constrained by that look, rose\nand went to the door; and as before with Osric, so now the wind blew\nstrong against him; and it blew into his face, so as to blind him,\ntresses of soft brown hair mingled with glittering threads of gold; and\nblinded so, he heard some one ask him musically, solemnly, if a lady with\ngolden hair and white raiment was in that house; so Herman, not answering\nin words, because of his awe and fear, merely bowed his head; then he was\n'ware of some one in bright armour passing him, for the gleam of it was\nall about him, for as yet he could not see clearly, being blinded by the\nhair that had floated about him.\n\nBut presently he followed him into the room, and there stood such an one\nas the lady had described; the wavering flame of the light gleamed from\nhis polished helmet, touched the golden threads that mingled with his\nhair, ran along the rings of his mail.\n\nThey stood opposite to each other for a little, he and the lady, as if\nthey were somewhat shy of each other after their parting of a hundred\nyears, in spite of the love which they had for each other: at last he\nmade one step, and took off his gleaming helmet, laid it down softly,\nthen spread abroad his arms, and she came to him, and they were clasped\ntogether, her head lying over his shoulder; and the four men gazed, quite\nawe-struck.\n\nAnd as they gazed, the bells of the church began to ring, for it was New-\nYear's-eve; and still they clung together, and the bells rang on, and the\nold year died.\n\nAnd there beneath the eyes of those four men the lovers slowly faded away\ninto a heap of snow-white ashes.  Then the four men kneeled down and\nprayed, and the next day they went to the priest, and told him all that\nhad happened.\n\nSo the people took those ashes and buried them in their church, in a\nmarble tomb, and above it they caused to be carved their figures lying\nwith clasped hands; and on the sides of it the history of the cave in the\nred pike.\n\nAnd in my dream I saw the moon shining on the tomb, throwing fair colours\non it from the painted glass; till a sound of music rose, deepened, and\nfainted; then I woke.\n\n\n\n\nGOLDEN WINGS\n\n\n   Lyf lythes to nee,\n   Twa wordes or three,\n   Of one who was fair and free,\n         And fele in his fight.\n\n   --_Sir Percival_.\n\nI suppose my birth was somewhat after the birth of Sir Percival of\nGalles, for I never saw my father, and my mother brought me up quaintly;\nnot like a poor man's son, though, indeed, we had little money, and lived\nin a lone place: it was on a bit of waste land near a river; moist, and\nwithout trees; on the drier parts of it folks had built cottages--see, I\ncan count them on my fingers--six cottages, of which ours was one.\n\nLikewise, there was a little chapel, with a yew tree and graves in the\nchurch-yard--graves--yes, a great many graves, more than in the yards of\nmany Minsters I have seen, because people fought a battle once near us,\nand buried many bodies in deep pits, to the east of the chapel; but this\nwas before I was born.\n\nI have talked to old knights since who fought in that battle, and who\ntold me that it was all about a lady that they fought; indeed, this lady,\nwho was a queen, was afterwards, by her own wish, buried in the aforesaid\nchapel in a most fair tomb; her image was of latoun gilt, and with a\ncolour on it; her hands and face were of silver, and her hair, gilded and\nmost curiously wrought, flowed down from her head over the marble.\n\nIt was a strange sight to see that gold and brass and marble inside that\nrough chapel which stood on the marshy common, near the river.\n\nNow, every St. Peter's day, when the sun was at its hottest, in the mid-\nsummer noontide, my mother (though at other times she only wore such\nclothes as the folk about us) would dress herself most richly, and shut\nthe shutters against all the windows, and light great candles, and sit as\nthough she were a queen, till the evening: sitting and working at a\nframe, and singing as she worked.\n\nAnd what she worked at was two wings, wrought in gold, on a blue ground.\n\nAnd as for what she sung, I could never understand it, though I know now\nit was not in Latin.\n\nAnd she used to charge me straightly never to let any man into the house\non St. Peter's day; therefore, I and our dog, which was a great old\nbloodhound, always kept the door together.\n\nBut one St. Peter's day, when I was nearly twenty, I sat in the house\nwatching the door with the bloodhound, and I was sleepy, because of the\nshut-up heat and my mother's singing, so I began to nod, and at last,\nthough the dog often shook me by the hair to keep me awake, went fast\nasleep, and began to dream a foolish dream without hearing, as men\nsometimes do: for I thought that my mother and I were walking to mass\nthrough the snow on a Christmas day, but my mother carried a live goose\nin her hand, holding it by the neck, instead of her rosary, and that I\nwent along by her side, not walking, but turning somersaults like a\nmountebank, my head never touching the ground; when we got to the chapel\ndoor, the old priest met us, and said to my mother, 'Why dame alive, your\nhead is turned green!  Ah! never mind, I will go and say mass, but don't\nlet little Mary there go,' and he pointed to the goose, and went.\n\nThen mass begun, but in the midst of it, the priest said out aloud, 'Oh I\nforgot,' and turning round to us began to wag his grey head and white\nbeard, throwing his head right back, and sinking his chin on his breast\nalternately; and when we saw him do this, we presently began also to\nknock our heads against the wall, keeping time with him and with each\nother, till the priest said, 'Peter! it's dragon-time now,' whereat the\nroof flew off, and a great yellow dragon came down on the chapel-floor\nwith a flop, and danced about clumsily, wriggling his fat tail, and\nsaying to a sort of tune, 'O the Devil, the Devil, the Devil, O the\nDevil,' so I went up to him, and put my hand on his breast, meaning to\nslay him, and so awoke, and found myself standing up with my hand on the\nbreast of an armed knight; the door lay flat on the ground, and under it\nlay Hector, our dog, whining and dying.\n\nFor eight hours I had been asleep; on awaking, the blood rushed up into\nmy face, I heard my mother's low mysterious song behind me, and knew not\nwhat harm might happen to her and me, if that knight's coming made her\ncease in it; so I struck him with my left hand, where his face was bare\nunder his mail-coif, and getting my sword in my light hand, drove its\npoint under his hawberk, so that it came out behind, and he fell, turned\nover on his face, and died.\n\nThen, because my mother still went on working and singing, I said no\nword, but let him lie there, and put the door up again, and found Hector\ndead.\n\nI then sat down again and polished my sword with a piece of leather after\nI had wiped the blood from it; and in an hour my mother arose from her\nwork, and raising me from where I was sitting, kissed my brow, saying,\n'Well done, Lionel, you have slain our greatest foe, and now the people\nwill know you for what you are before you die--Ah God! though not before\n_I_ die.'\n\nSo I said, 'Who is he, mother? he seems to be some Lord; am I a Lord\nthen?'\n\n'A King, if the people will but know it,' she said.\n\nThen she knelt down by the dead body, turned it round again, so that it\nlay face uppermost, as before, then said:\n\n'And so it has all come to this, has it?  To think that you should run on\nmy son's sword-point at last, after all the wrong you have done me and\nmine; now must I work carefully, least when you are dead you should still\ndo me harm, for that you are a King--Lionel!'\n\n'Yea, Mother.'\n\n'Come here and see; this is what I have wrought these many Peter's days\nby day, and often other times by night.'\n\n'It is a surcoat, Mother; for me?'\n\n'Yea, but take a spade, and come into the wood.'\n\nSo we went, and my mother gazed about her for a while as if she were\nlooking for something, but then suddenly went forward with her eyes on\nthe ground, and she said to me:\n\n'Is it not strange, that I who know the very place I am going to take you\nto, as well as our own garden, should have a sudden fear come over me\nthat I should not find it after all; though for these nineteen years I\nhave watched the trees change and change all about it--ah! here, stop\nnow.'\n\nWe stopped before a great oak; a beech tree was behind us--she said,\n'Dig, Lionel, hereabouts.'\n\nSo I dug and for an hour found nothing but beech roots, while my mother\nseemed as if she were going mad, sometimes running about muttering to\nherself, sometimes stooping into the hole and howling, sometimes throwing\nherself on the grass and twisting her hands together above her head; she\nwent once down the hill to a pool that had filled an old gravel pit, and\ncame back dripping and with wild eyes; 'I am too hot,' she said, 'far too\nhot this St. Peter's day.'\n\nClink just then from my spade against iron; my mother screamed, and I dug\nwith all my might for another hour, and then beheld a chest of heavy wood\nbound with iron ready to be heaved out of the hole; 'Now Lionel weigh it\nout--hard for your life!'\n\nAnd with some trouble I got the chest out; she gave me a key, I unlocked\nthe chest, and took out another wrapped in lead, which also I unlocked\nwith a silver key that my mother gave me, and behold therein lay\narmour--mail for the whole body, made of very small rings wrought most\nwonderfully, for every ring was fashioned like a serpent, and though they\nwere so small yet could you see their scales and their eyes, and of some\neven the forked tongue was on it, and lay on the rivet, and the rings\nwere gilded here and there into patterns and flowers so that the gleam of\nit was most glorious.--And the mail coif was all gilded and had red and\nblue stones at the rivets; and the tilting helms (inside which the mail\nlay when I saw it first) was gilded also, and had flowers pricked out on\nit; and the chain of it was silver, and the crest was two gold wings.  And\nthere was a shield of blue set with red stones, which had two gold wings\nfor a cognizance; and the hilt of the sword was gold, with angels wrought\nin green and blue all up it, and the eyes in their wings were of pearls\nand red stones, and the sheath was of silver with green flowers on it.\n\nNow when I saw this armour and understood that my mother would have me\nput it on, and ride out without fear, leaving her alone, I cast myself\ndown on the grass so that I might not see its beauty (for it made me\nmad), and strove to think; but what thoughts soever came to me were only\nof the things that would be, glory in the midst of ladies, battle-joy\namong knights, honour from all kings and princes and people--these\nthings.\n\nBut my mother wept softly above me, till I arose with a great shudder of\ndelight and drew the edges of the hawberk over my cheek, I liked so to\nfeel the rings slipping, slipping, till they fell off altogether; then I\nsaid:\n\n'O Lord God that made the world, if I might only die in this armour!'\n\nThen my mother helped me to put it on, and I felt strange and new in it,\nand yet I had neither lance nor horse.\n\nSo when we reached the cottage again she said: 'See now, Lionel, you must\ntake this knight's horse and his lance, and ride away, or else the people\nwill come here to kill another king; and when you are gone, you will\nnever see me any more in life.'\n\nI wept thereat, but she said: 'Nay, but see here.'\n\nAnd taking the dead knight's lance from among the garden lilies, she rent\nfrom it the pennon (which had a sword on a red ground for bearing), and\ncast it carelessly on the ground, then she bound about it a pennon with\nmy bearing, gold wings on a blue ground; she bid me bear the Knight's\nbody, all armed as he was, to put on him his helm and lay him on the\nfloor at her bed's foot, also to break his sword and cast it on our\nhearth-stone; all which things I did.\n\nAfterwards she put the surcoat on me, and then lying down in her gorgeous\nraiment on her bed, she spread her arms out in the form of a cross, shut\nher eyes, and said:\n\n'Kiss me, Lionel, for I am tired.'\n\nAnd after I had kissed her she died.\n\nAnd I mounted my dead foe's horse and rode away; neither did I ever know\nwhat wrong that was which he had done me, not while I was in the body at\nleast.\n\nAnd do not blame me for not burying my mother; I left her there because,\nthough she did not say so to me, yet I knew the thoughts of her heart,\nand that the thing she had wished so earnestly for these years, and\nyears, and years, had been but to lie dead with him lying dead close to\nher.\n\nSo I rode all that night for I could not stop, because of the thoughts\nthat were in me, and, stopping at this place and that, in three days came\nto the city.\n\nAnd there the King held his court with great pomp.\n\nAnd so I went to the palace, and asked to see the King; whereupon they\nbrought me into the great hall where he was with all his knights, and my\nheart swelled within me to think that I too was a King.\n\nSo I prayed him to make me a knight, and he spake graciously and asked me\nmy name; so when I had told it him, and said that I was a king's son, he\npondered, not knowing what to do, for I could not tell him whose son I\nwas.\n\nWhereupon one of the knights came near me and shaded his eyes with his\nhand as one does in a bright sun, meaning to mock at me for my shining\narmour, and he drew nearer and nearer till his long stiff beard just\ntouched me, and then I smote him on the face, and he fell on the floor.\n\nSo the king being in a rage, roared out from the door, 'Slay him!' but I\nput my shield before me and drew my sword, and the women drew together\naside and whispered fearfully, and while some of the knights took spears\nand stood about me, others got their armour on.\n\nAnd as we stood thus we heard a horn blow, and then an armed knight came\ninto the hall and drew near to the King; and one of the maidens behind\nme, came and laid her hand on my shoulder; so I turned and saw that she\nwas very fair, and then I was glad, but she whispered to me: 'Sir Squire\nfor a love I have for your face and gold armour, I will give you good\ncounsel; go presently to the King and say to him: \"In the name of Alys\ndes roses and Sir Guy le bon amant I pray you three boons,\"--do this, and\nyou will be alive, and a knight by to-morrow, otherwise I think hardly\nthe one or the other.'\n\n'The Lord reward you damoyzel,' I said.  Then I saw that the King had\nleft talking with that knight and was just going to stand up and say\nsomething out loud, so I went quickly and called out with a loud voice:\n\n'O King Gilbert of the rose-land, I, Lionel of the golden wings, pray of\nyou three boons in the name of Alys des roses and Sir Guy le bon amant.'\n\nThen the King gnashed his teeth because he had promised if ever his\ndaughter Alys des roses came back safe again, he would on that day grant\nany three boons to the first man who asked them, even if he were his\ngreatest foe.  He said, 'Well, then, take them, what are they?'\n\n'First, my life; then, that you should make me a knight; and thirdly,\nthat you should take me into your service.'\n\nHe said, 'I will do this, and moreover, I forgive you freely if you will\nbe my true man.'  Then we heard shouting arise through all the city\nbecause they were bringing the Lady Alys from the ship up to the palace,\nand the people came to the windows, and the houses were hung with cloths\nand banners of silk and gold, that swung down right from the eaves to the\nground; likewise the bells all rang: and within a while they entered the\npalace, and the trumpets rang and men shouted, so that my head whirled;\nand they entered the hall, and the King went down from the dais to meet\nthem.\n\nNow a band of knights and of damoyzels went before and behind, and in the\nmidst Sir Guy led the Lady Alys by the hand, and he was a most stately\nknight, strong and fair.\n\nAnd I indeed noted the first band of knights and damoyzels well, and\nwondered at the noble presence of the knights, and was filled with joy\nwhen I beheld the maids, because of their great beauty; the second band I\ndid not see, for when they passed I was leaning back against the wall,\nwishing to die with my hands before my face.  But when I could see, she\nwas hanging about her father's neck, weeping, and she never left him all\nthat night, but held his hand in feast and dance, and even when I was\nmade knight, while the king with his right hand laid his sword over my\nshoulder, she held his left hand and was close to me.\n\nAnd the next day they held a grand tourney, that I might be proven; and I\nhad never fought with knights before, yet I did not doubt.  And Alys sat\nunder a green canopy, that she might give the degree to the best knight,\nand by her sat the good knight Sir Guy, in a long robe, for he did not\nmean to joust that day; and indeed at first none but young knights\njousted, for they thought that I should not do much.\n\nBut I, looking up to the green canopy, overthrew so many of them, that\nthe elder knights began to arm, and I grew most joyful as I met them, and\nno man unhorsed me; and always I broke my spear fairly, or else overthrew\nmy adversary.\n\nNow that maiden who counselled me in the hall, told me afterwards that as\nI fought, the Lady Alys held fast to the rail before her, and leaned\nforward and was most pale, never answering any word that any one might\nsay to her, till the Knight Guy said to her in anger: 'Alys! what ails\nyou? you would have been glad enough to speak to me when King Wadrayns\ncarried you off shrieking, or that other time when the chain went round\nabout you, and the faggots began to smoke in the Brown City: do you not\nlove me any longer?  O Alys, Alys! just think a little, and do not break\nyour faith with me; God hates nothing so much as this.  Sweet, try to\nlove me, even for your own sake!  See, am I not kind to you?'\n\nThat maiden said that she turned round to him wonderingly, as if she had\nnot caught his meaning, and that just for one second, then stretched out\nover the lists again.\n\nNow till about this time I had made no cry as I jousted.  But there came\nagainst me a very tall knight, on a great horse, and when we met our\nspears both shivered, and he howled with vexation, for he wished to slay\nme, being the brother of that knight I had struck down in the hall the\nday before.\n\nAnd they say that when Alys heard his howl sounding faintly through the\nbars of his great helm, she trembled; but I know not, for I was stronger\nthan that knight, and when we fought with swords, I struck him right out\nof his saddle, and near slew him with that stroke.\n\nWhereupon I shouted 'Alys' out loud, and she blushed red for pleasure,\nand Sir Guy took note of it, and rose up in a rage and ran down and\narmed.\n\nThen presently I saw a great knight come riding in with three black\nchevrons on a gold shield: and so he began to ride at me, and at first we\nonly broke both our spears, but then he drew his sword, and fought quite\nin another way to what the other knights had, so that I saw at once that\nI had no chance against him: nevertheless, for a long time he availed\nnothing, though he wounded me here and there, but at last drove his sword\nright through mine, through my shield and my helm, and I fell, and lay\nlike one dead.\n\nAnd thereat the King cried out to cease, and the degree was given to Sir\nGuy, because I had overthrown forty knights and he had overthrown me.\n\nThen they told me, I was carried out of the lists and laid in a hostelry\nnear the palace, and Guy went up to the pavilion where Alys was and she\ncrowned him, both of them being very pale, for she doubted if I were\nslain, and he knew that she did not love him, thinking before that she\ndid; for he was good and true, and had saved her life and honour, and she\n(poor maid!) wished to please her father, and strove to think that all\nwas right.\n\nBut I was by no means slain, for the sword had only cleft my helm, and\nwhen I came to myself again I felt despair of all things, because I knew\nnot that she loved me, for how should she, knowing nothing of me?\nlikewise dust had been cast on my gold wings, and she saw it done.\n\nThen I heard a great crying in the street, that sounded strangely in the\nquiet night, so I sent to ask what it might be: and there came presently\ninto my chamber a man in gilded armour; he was an old man, and his hair\nand beard were gray, and behind him came six men armed, who carried a\ndead body of a young man between them, and I said, 'What is it? who is\nhe?'  Then the old man, whose head was heavy for grief, said: 'Oh, sir!\nthis is my son; for as we went yesterday with our merchandize some twenty\nmiles from this fair town, we passed by a certain hold, and therefrom\ncame a knight and men at arms, who when my son would have fought with\nthem, overthrew him and bound him, and me and all our men they said they\nwould slay if we did ought; so then they cut out my son's eyes, and cut\noff his hands, and then said, \"The Knight of High Gard takes these for\ntribute.\"  Therewithal they departed, taking with them my son's eyes and\nhis hands on a platter; and when they were gone I would have followed\nthem, and slain some of them at least, but my own people would not suffer\nme, and for grief and pain my son's heart burst, and he died, and behold\nI am here.'\n\nThen I thought I could win glory, and I was much rejoiced thereat, and\nsaid to the old man,\n\n'Would you love to be revenged?'\n\nBut he set his teeth, and pulled at the skirt of his surcoat, as hardly\nfor his passion he said, 'Yes.'\n\n'Then,' I said, 'I will go and try to slay this knight, if you will show\nme the way to La Haute Garde.'\n\nAnd he, taking my hand, said, 'O glorious knight, let us go now!'  And he\ndid not ask who I was, or whether I was a good knight, but began to go\ndown the stairs at once, so I put on my armour and followed him.\n\nAnd we two set forth alone to La Haute Garde, for no man else dared\nfollow us, and I rejoiced in thinking that while Guy was sitting at the\nKing's table feasting, I was riding out to slay the King's enemies, for\nit never once seemed possible to me that I should be worsted.\n\nIt was getting light again by then we came in sight of High Gard; we\nwound up the hill on foot, for it was very steep; I blew at the gates a\ngreat blast which was even as though the stag should blow his own mort,\nor like the blast that Balen heard.\n\nFor in a very short while the gates opened and a great band of armed men,\nmore than thirty I think, and a knight on horseback among them, who was\narmed in red, stood before us, and on one side of him was a serving man\nwith a silver dish, on the other, one with a butcher's cleaver, a knife,\nand pincers.\n\nSo when the knight saw us he said, 'What, are you come to pay tribute in\nperson, old man, and is this another fair son?  Good sir, how is your\nlady?'\n\nSo I said grimly, being in a rage, 'I have a will to slay you.'\n\nBut I could scarce say so before the old merchant rushed at the red\nknight with a yell, who without moving slew his horse with an axe, and\nthen the men at arms speared the old man, slaying him as one would an\notter or a rat.\n\nAfterwards they were going to set on me, but the red knight held them\nback, saying: 'Nay, I am enough,' and we spurred on our horses.\n\nAs we met, I felt just as if some one had thrown a dull brown cloth over\nmy eyes, and I felt the wretched spear-point slip off his helm; then I\nfelt a great pain somewhere, that did not seem to be in my body, but in\nthe world, or the sky, or something of that sort.\n\nAnd I know not how long that pain seemed to last now, but I think years,\nthough really I grew well and sane again in a few weeks.\n\nAnd when I woke, scarce knowing whether I was in the world or heaven or\nhell, I heard some one singing.\n\nI tried to listen but could not, because I did not know where I was, and\nwas thinking of that; I missed verse after verse of the song, this song,\ntill at last I saw I must be in the King's palace.\n\nThere was a window by my bed, I looked out at it, and saw that I was high\nup; down in the street the people were going to and fro, and there was a\nknot of folks gathered about a minstrel, who sat on the edge of a\nfountain, with his head laid sideways on his shoulder, and nursing one\nleg on the other; he was singing only, having no instrument, and he sang\nthe song I had tried to listen to, I heard some of it now:\n\n   'He was fair and free,\n   At every tourney\n   He wan the degree,\n      Sir Guy the good knight.\n\n   'He wan Alys the fair,\n   The King's own daughtere,\n   With all her gold hair,\n      That shone well bright.\n\n   'He saved a good Knight,\n   Who also was wight,\n   And had winges bright\n      On a blue shield.\n\n   'And he slew the Knight\n   Of the High Gard in fight,\n   In red weed that was dight\n      In the open field.'\n\nI fell back in my bed and wept, for I was weak with my illness; to think\nof this! truly this man was a perfect knight, and deserved to win Alys.\nAh! well! but was this the glory I was to have, and no one believed that\nI was a King's son.\n\nAnd so I passed days and nights, thinking of my dishonour and misery, and\nmy utter loneliness; no one cared for me; verily, I think, if any one had\nspoken to me lovingly, I should have fallen on his neck and died, while I\nwas so weak.\n\nBut I grew strong at last, and began to walk about, and in the Palace\nPleasaunce, one day, I met Sir Guy walking by himself.\n\nSo I told him how that I thanked him with all my heart for my life, but\nhe said it was only what a good knight ought to do; for that hearing the\nmad enterprise I had ridden on, he had followed me swiftly with a few\nknights, and so saved me.\n\nHe looked stately and grand as he spoke, yet I did not love him, nay,\nrather hated him, though I tried hard not to do so, for there was some\nair of pitiless triumph and coldness of heart in him that froze me; so\nscornfully, too, he said that about 'my mad enterprise,' as though I\n_must_ be wrong in everything I did.  Yet afterwards, as I came to know\nmore, I pitied him instead of hating; but at that time I thought his life\nwas without a shadow, for I did not know that the Lady Alys loved him\nnot.\n\nAnd now I turned from him, and walked slowly up and down the\ngarden-paths, not exactly thinking, but with some ghosts of former\nthoughts passing through my mind.  The day, too, was most lovely, as it\ngrew towards evening, and I had all the joy of a man lately sick in the\nflowers and all things; if any bells at that time had begun to chime, I\nthink I should have lain down on the grass and wept; but now there was\nbut the noise of the bees in the yellow musk, and that had not music\nenough to bring me sorrow.\n\nAnd as I walked I stooped and picked a great orange lily, and held it in\nmy hand, and lo! down the garden walk, the same fair damozel that had\nbefore this given me good counsel in the hall.\n\nThereat I was very glad, and walked to meet her smiling, but she was very\ngrave, and said:\n\n'Fair sir, the Lady Alys des roses wishes to see you in her chamber.'\n\nI could not answer a word, but turned, and went with her while she walked\nslowly beside me, thinking deeply, and picking a rose to pieces as she\nwent; and I, too, thought much, what could she want me for? surely, but\nfor one thing; and yet--and yet.\n\nBut when we came to the lady's chamber, behold! before the door, stood a\ntall knight, fair and strong, and in armour, save his head, who seemed to\nbe guarding the door, though not so as to seem so to all men.\n\nHe kissed the damozel eagerly, and then she said to me, 'This is Sir\nWilliam de la Fosse, my true knight;' so the knight took my hand and\nseemed to have such joy of me, that all the blood came up to my face for\npure delight.\n\nBut then the damozel Blanche opened the door and bade me go in while she\nabode still without; so I entered, when I had put aside the heavy silken\nhangings that filled the doorway.\n\nAnd there sat Alys; she arose when she saw me, and stood pale, and with\nher lips apart, and her hands hanging loose by her side.\n\nAnd then all doubt and sorrow went quite away from me; I did not even\nfeel drunk with joy, but rather felt that I could take it all in, lose no\nleast fragment of it; then at once I felt that I was beautiful, and brave\nand true; I had no doubt as to what I should do now.\n\nI went up to her, and first kissed her on the forehead, and then on the\nfeet, and then drew her to me, and with my arms round about her, and her\narms hanging loose, and her lips dropped, we held our lips together so\nlong that my eyes failed me, and I could not see her, till I looked at\nher green raiment.\n\nAnd she had never spoken to me yet; she seemed just then as if she were\ngoing to, for she lifted her eyes to mine, and opened her mouth; but she\nonly said, 'Dear Lionel,' and fell forward as though she were faint; and\nagain I held her, and kissed her all over; and then she loosed her hair\nthat it fell to her feet, and when I clipped her next, she threw it over\nme, that it fell all over my scarlet robes like trickling of some golden\nwell in Paradise.\n\nThen, within a while, we called in the Lady Blanche and Sir William de la\nFosse, and while they talked about what we should do, we sat together and\nkissed; and what they said, I know not.\n\nBut I remember, that that night, quite late, Alys and I rode out side by\nside from the good city in the midst of a great band of knights and men-\nat-arms, and other bands drew to us as we went, and in three days we\nreached Sir William's castle which was called 'La Garde des Chevaliers.'\n\nAnd straightway he caused toll the great bell, and to hang out from the\nhighest tower a great banner of red and gold, cut into so many points\nthat it seemed as if it were tattered; for this was the custom of his\nhouse when they wanted their vassals together.\n\nAnd Alys and I stood up in the tower by the great bell as they tolled it;\nI remember now that I had passed my hand underneath her hair, so that the\nfingers of it folded over and just lay on her cheek; she gazed down on\nthe bell, and at every deafening stroke she drew in her breath and opened\nher eyes to a wide stare downwards.\n\nBut on the very day that we came, they arrayed her in gold and flowers\n(and there were angels and knights and ladies wrought on her gold\nraiment), and I waited for an hour in the chapel till she came, listening\nto the swallows outside, and gazing with parted lips at the pictures on\nthe golden walls; but when she came, I knelt down before the altar, and\nshe knelt down and kissed my lips; and then the priest came in, and the\nsingers and the censer-boys; and that chapel was soon confusedly full of\ngolden raiment, and incense, and ladies and singing; in the midst of\nwhich I wedded Alys.  And men came into Knights' Gard till we had two\nthousand men in it, and great store of munitions of war and provisions.\n\nBut Alys and I lived happily together in the painted hall and in the fair\nwater-meadows, and as yet no one came against us.\n\nAnd still her talk was, of deeds of arms, and she was never tired of\nletting the serpent rings of my mail slip off her wrist and long hand,\nand she would kiss my shield and helm and the gold wings on my surcoat,\nmy mother's work, and would talk of the ineffable joy that would be when\nwe had fought through all the evil that was coming on us.\n\nAlso she would take my sword and lay it on her knees and talk to it,\ntelling it how much she loved me.\n\nYea in all things, O Lord God, Thou knowest that my love was a very\nchild, like thy angels.  Oh! my wise soft-handed love! endless passion!\nendless longing always satisfied!\n\nThink you that the shouting curses of the trumpet broke off our love, or\nin any ways lessened it? no, most certainly, but from the time the siege\nbegan, her cheeks grew thinner, and her passionate face seemed more and\nmore a part of me; now too, whenever I happened to see her between the\ngrim fighting she would do nothing but kiss me all the time, or wring my\nhands, or take my head on her breast, being so eagerly passionate that\nsometimes a pang shot through me that she might die.\n\nTill one day they made a breach in the wall, and when I heard of it for\nthe first time, I sickened, and could not call on God; but Alys cut me a\ntress of her yellow hair and tied it in my helm, and armed me, and saying\nno word, led me down to the breach by the hand, and then went back most\nghastly pale.\n\nSo there on the one side of the breach were the spears of William de la\nFosse and Lionel of the gold wings, and on the other the spears of King\nGilbert and Sir Guy le bon amant, but the King himself was not there; Sir\nGuy was.\n\nWell,--what would you have? in this world never yet could two thousand\nmen stand against twenty thousand; we were almost pushed back with their\nspear-points, they were so close together:--slay six of them and the\nspears were as thick as ever; but if two of our men fell there was\nstraightway a hole.\n\nYet just at the end of this we drove them back in one charge two yards\nbeyond the breach, and behold in the front rank, Sir Guy, utterly\nfearless, cool, and collected; nevertheless, with one stroke I broke his\nhelm, and he fell to the ground before the two armies, even as I fell\nthat day in the lists; and we drove them twenty feet farther, yet they\nsaved Sir Guy.\n\nWell, again,--what would you have?  They drove us back again, and they\ndrove us into our inner castle walls.  And I was the last to go in, and\njust as I was entering, the boldest and nearest of the enemy clutched at\nmy love's hair in my helm, shouting out quite loud, 'Whore's hair for\nJohn the goldsmith!'\n\nAt the hearing of which blasphemy the Lord gave me such strength, that I\nturned and caught him by the ribs with my left hand, and with my right,\nby sheer strength, I tore off his helm and part of his nose with it, and\nthen swinging him round about, dashed his brains out against the castle-\nwalls.\n\nYet thereby was I nearly slain, for they surrounded me, only Sir William\nand the others charged out and rescued me, but hardly.\n\nMay the Lord help all true men!  In an hour we were all fighting pell\nmell on the walls of the castle itself, and some were slain outright, and\nsome were wounded, and some yielded themselves and received mercy; but I\nhad scarce the heart to fight any more, because I thought of Alys lying\nwith her face upon the floor and her agonised hands outspread, trying to\nclutch something, trying to hold to the cracks of the boarding.  So when\nI had seen William de la Fosse slain by many men, I cast my shield and\nhelm over the battlements, and gazed about for a second, and lo! on one\nof the flanking towers, my gold wings still floated by the side of\nWilliam's white lion, and in the other one I knew my poor Love, whom they\nhad left quite alone, was lying.\n\nSo then I turned into a dark passage and ran till I reached the tower\nstairs, up that too I sprang as though a ghost were after me, I did so\nlong to kiss her again before I died, to soothe her too, so that she\nshould not feel this day, when in the aftertimes she thought of it, as\nwholly miserable to her.  For I knew they would neither slay her nor\ntreat her cruelly, for in sooth all loved her, only they would make her\nmarry Sir Guy le bon amant.\n\nIn the topmost room I found her, alas! alas! lying on the floor, as I\nsaid; I came to her and kissed her head as she lay, then raised her up;\nand I took all my armour off and broke my sword over my knee.\n\nAnd then I led her to the window away from the fighting, from whence we\nonly saw the quiet country, and kissed her lips till she wept and looked\nno longer sad and wretched; then I said to her:\n\n'Now, O Love, we must part for a little, it is time for me to go and\ndie.'\n\n'Why should you go away?' she said, 'they will come here quick enough, no\ndoubt, and I shall have you longer with me if you stay; I do not turn\nsick at the sight of blood.'\n\n'O my poor Love!'  And I could not go because of her praying face; surely\nGod would grant anything to such a face as that.\n\n'Oh!' she said, 'you will let me have you yet a little longer, I see;\nalso let me kiss your feet.'\n\nShe threw herself down and kissed them, and then did not get up again at\nonce, but lay there holding my feet.\n\nAnd while she lay there, behold a sudden tramping that she did not hear,\nand over the green hangings the gleam of helmets that she did not see,\nand then one pushed aside the hangings with his spear, and there stood\nthe armed men.\n\n'Will not somebody weep for my darling?'\n\nShe sprang up from my feet with a low, bitter moan, most terrible to\nhear, she kissed me once on the lips, and then stood aside, with her dear\nhead thrown back, and holding her lovely loose hair strained over her\noutspread arms, as though she were wearied of all things that had been or\nthat might be.\n\nThen one thrust me through the breast with a spear, and another with his\nsword, which was three inches broad, gave me a stroke across the thighs\nthat hit to the bone; and as I fell forward one cleft me to the teeth\nwith his axe.\n\nAnd then I heard my darling shriek.\n\n\n\n\nSVEND AND HIS BRETHREN\n\n\nA king in the olden time ruled over a mighty nation: a proud man he must\nhave been, any man who was king of that nation: hundreds of lords, each a\nprince over many people, sat about him in the council chamber, under the\ndim vault, that was blue like the vault of heaven, and shone with\ninnumerable glistenings of golden stars.\n\nNorth, south, east, and west spread that land of his, the sea did not\nstop it; his empire clomb the high mountains, and spread abroad its arms\nover the valleys of them; all along the sea-line shore cities set with\ntheir crowns of towers in the midst of broad bays, each fit, it seemed,\nto be a harbour for the navies of all the world.\n\nInland the pastures and cornlands lay, chequered much with climbing, over-\ntumbling grape vines, under the sun that crumbled their clods, and drew\nup the young wheat in the spring-time, under the rain that made the long\ngrass soft and fine, under all fair fertilising influences: the streams\nleapt down from the mountain tops, or cleft their way through the ridged\nravines; they grew great rivers, like seas each one.\n\nThe mountains were cloven, and gave forth from their scarred sides wealth\nof ore and splendour of marble; all things this people that King Valdemar\nruled over could do; they levelled mountains, that over the smooth roads\nthe wains might go, laden with silk and spices from the sea: they drained\nlakes, that the land might yield more and more, as year by year the\nserfs, driven like cattle, but worse fed, worse housed, died slowly,\nscarce knowing that they had souls; they builded them huge ships, and\nsaid that they were masters of the sea too; only, I trow the sea was an\nunruly subject, and often sent them back their ships cut into more pieces\nthan the pines of them were, when the adze first fell upon them; they\nraised towers, and bridges, and marble palaces with endless corridors\nrose-scented, and cooled with welling fountains.\n\nThey sent great armies and fleets to all the points of heaven that the\nwind blows from, who took and burned many happy cities, wasted many\nfields and valleys, blotted out from the memory of men the names of\nnations, made their men's lives a hopeless shame and misery to them,\ntheir women's lives disgrace, and then came home to have flowers thrown\non them in showers, to be feasted and called heroes.\n\nShould not then their king be proud of them?  Moreover they could fashion\nstone and brass into the shapes of men; they could write books; they knew\nthe names of the stars, and their number; they knew what moved the\npassions of men in the hearts of them, and could draw you up cunningly,\ncatalogues of virtues and vices; their wise men could prove to you that\nany lie was true, that any truth was false, till your head grew dizzy,\nand your heart sick, and you almost doubted if there were a God.\n\nShould not then their king be proud of them?  Their men were strong in\nbody, and moved about gracefully--like dancers; and the purple-black,\nscented hair of their gold-clothed knights seemed to shoot out rays under\nthe blaze of light that shone like many suns in the king's halls.  Their\nwomen's faces were very fair in red and white, their skins fair and half-\ntransparent like the marble of their mountains, and their voices sounded\nlike the rising of soft music from step to step of their own white\npalaces.\n\nShould not then their king be proud of such a people, who seemed to help\nso in carrying on the world to its consummate perfection, which they even\nhoped their grandchildren would see?\n\nAlas! alas! they were slaves--king and priest, noble and burgher, just as\nmuch as the meanest tasked serf, perhaps more even than he, for they were\nso willingly, but he unwillingly enough.\n\nThey could do everything but justice, and truth, and mercy; therefore\nGod's judgments hung over their heads, not fallen yet, but surely to fall\none time or other.\n\nFor ages past they had warred against one people only, whom they could\nnot utterly subdue; a feeble people in numbers, dwelling in the very\nmidst of them, among the mountains; yet now they were pressing them\nclose; acre after acre, with seas of blood to purchase each acre, had\nbeen wrested from the free people, and their end seemed drawing near; and\nthis time the king, Valdemar, had marched to their land with a great\narmy, to make war on them, he boasted to himself, almost for the last\ntime.\n\nA walled town in the free land; in that town, a house built of rough,\nsplintery stones; and in a great low-browed room of that house, a grey-\nhaired man pacing to and fro impatiently: 'Will she never come?' he says,\n'it is two hours since the sun set; news, too, of the enemy's being in\nthe land; how dreadful if she is taken!'  His great broad face is marked\nwith many furrows made by the fierce restless energy of the man; but\nthere is a wearied look on it, the look of a man who, having done his\nbest, is yet beaten; he seemed to long to be gone and be at peace: he,\nthe fighter in many battles, who often had seemed with his single arm to\nroll back the whole tide of fight, felt despairing enough now; this last\ninvasion, he thought, must surely quite settle the matter; wave after\nwave, wave after wave, had broken on that dear land and been rolled back\nfrom it, and still the hungry sea pressed on; they must be finally\ndrowned in that sea; how fearfully they had been tried for their sins.\nBack again to his anxiety concerning Cissela, his daughter, go his\nthoughts, and he still paces up and down wearily, stopping now and then\nto gaze intently on things which he has seen a hundred times; and the\nnight has altogether come on.\n\nAt last the blast of a horn from outside, challenge and\ncounter-challenge, and the wicket to the court-yard is swung open; for\nthis house, being in a part of the city where the walls are somewhat\nweak, is a little fortress in itself, and is very carefully guarded.  The\nold man's face brightened at the sound of the new comers, and he went\ntoward the entrance of the house where he was met by two young knights\nfully armed, and a maiden.  'Thank God you are come,' he says; but stops\nwhen he sees her face, which is quite pale, almost wild with some sorrow.\n'The saints!  Cissela, what is it?' he says.  'Father, Eric will tell\nyou.'  Then suddenly a clang, for Eric has thrown on the ground a richly-\njewelled sword, sheathed, and sets his foot on it, crunching the pearls\non the sheath; then says, flinging up his head,--'There, father, the\nenemy is in the land; may that happen to every one of them! but for my\npart I have accounted for two already.'  'Son Eric, son Eric, you talk\nfor ever about yourself; quick, tell me about Cissela instead: if you go\non boasting and talking always about yourself, you will come to no good\nend, son, after all.'  But as he says this, he smiles nevertheless, and\nhis eye glistens.\n\n'Well, father, listen--such a strange thing she tells us, not to be\nbelieved, if she did not tell us herself; the enemy has suddenly got\ngenerous, one of them at least, which is something of a disappointment to\nme--ah! pardon, about my self again; and that is about myself too.  Well,\nfather, what am I to do?--But Cissela, she wandered some way from her\nmaidens, when--ah! but I never could tell a story properly, let her tell\nit herself; here, Cissela!--well, well, I see she is better employed,\ntalking namely, how should I know what! with Siur in the window-seat\nyonder--but she told us that, as she wandered almost by herself, she\npresently heard shouts and saw many of the enemy's knights riding quickly\ntowards her; whereat she knelt only and prayed to God, who was very\ngracious to her; for when, as she thought, something dreadful was about\nto happen, the chief of the knights (a very noble-looking man, she said)\nrescued her, and, after he had gazed earnestly into her face, told her\nshe might go back again to her own home, and her maids with her, if only\nshe would tell him where she dwelt and her name; and withal he sent three\nknights to escort her some way toward the city; then he turned and rode\naway with all his knights but those three, who, when they knew that he\nhad quite gone, she says, began to talk horribly, saying things whereof\nin her terror she understood the import only: then, before worse came to\npass came I and slew two, as I said, and the other ran away 'lustily with\na good courage'; and that is the sword of one of the slain knights, or,\nas one might rather call them, rascally caitiffs.'\n\nThe old man's thoughts seemed to have gone wandering after his son had\nfinished; for he said nothing for some time, but at last spoke\ndejectedly:\n\n'Eric, brave son, when I was your age I too hoped, and my hopes are come\nto this at last; you are blind in your hopeful youth, Eric, and do not\nsee that this king (for the king it certainly was) will crush us, and not\nthe less surely because he is plainly not ungenerous, but rather a good,\ncourteous knight.  Alas! poor old Gunnar, broken down now and ready to\ndie, as your country is!  How often, in the olden time, thou used'st to\nsay to thyself, as thou didst ride at the head of our glorious house,\n'this charge may finish this matter, this battle must.'  They passed\naway, those gallant fights, and still the foe pressed on, and hope, too,\nslowly ebbed away, as the boundaries of our land grew less and less:\nbehold this is the last wave but one or two, and then for a sad farewell\nto name and freedom.  Yet, surely the end of the world must come when we\nare swept off the face of the earth.  God waits long, they say, before He\navenges his own.'\n\nAs he was speaking, Siur and Cissela came nearer to him, and Cissela, all\ntraces of her late terror gone from her face now, raising her lips to his\nbended forehead, kissed him fondly, and said, with glowing face,\n\n'Father, how can I help our people?  Do they want deaths?  I will die.  Do\nthey want happiness?  I will live miserably through years and years, nor\never pray for death.'\n\nSome hope or other seemed growing up in his heart, and showing through\nhis face; and he spoke again, putting back the hair from off her face,\nand clasping it about with both his hands, while he stooped to kiss her.\n\n'God remember your mother, Cissela!  Then it was no dream after all, but\ntrue perhaps, as indeed it seemed at the time; but it must come quickly,\nthat woman's deliverance, or not at all.  When was it that I heard that\nold tale, that sounded even then true to my ears? for we have not been\npunished for nought, my son; that is not God's way.  It comes across my\nmemory somehow, mingled in a wonderful manner with the purple of the\npines on the hillside, with the fragrance of them borne from far towards\nme; for know, my children, that in times past, long, long past now, we\ndid an evil deed, for our forefathers, who have been dead now, and\nforgiven so long ago, once mad with rage at some defeat from their\nenemies, fired a church, and burned therein many women who had fled\nthither for refuge; and from that time a curse cleaves to us.  Only they\nsay, that at the last we may be saved from utter destruction by a woman;\nI know not.  God grant it may be so.'\n\nThen she said, 'Father, brother, and you, Siur, come with me to the\nchapel; I wish you to witness me make an oath.'\n\nHer face was pale, her lips were pale, her golden hair was pale; but not\npale, it seemed, from any sinking of blood, but from gathering of\nintensest light from somewhere, her eyes perhaps, for they appeared to\nburn inwardly.\n\nThey followed the sweeping of her purple robe in silence through the low\nheavy-beamed passages: they entered the little chapel, dimly lighted by\nthe moon that night, as it shone through one of the three arrow-slits of\nwindows at the east end.  There was little wealth of marble there, I\ntrow; little time had those fighting men for stone-smoothing.  Albeit,\none noted many semblances of flowers even in the dim half-light, and here\nand there the faces of BRAVE men, roughly cut enough, but grand, because\nthe hand of the carver had followed his loving heart.  Neither was there\ngold wanting to the altar and its canopy; and above the low pillars of\nthe nave hung banners, taken from the foe by the men of that house,\ngallant with gold and jewels.\n\nShe walked up to the altar and took the blessed book of the Gospels from\nthe left side of it, then knelt in prayer for a moment or two, while the\nthree men stood behind her reverently.  When she rose she made a sign to\nthem, and from their scabbards gleamed three swords in the moonlight;\nthen, while they held them aloft, and pointed toward the altar, she\nopened the book at the page whereon was painted Christ the Lord dying on\nthe cross, pale against the gleaming gold: she said, in a firm voice,\n'Christ God, who diedst for all men, so help me, as I refuse not life,\nhappiness, even honour, for this people whom I love.'\n\nThen she kissed the face so pale against the gold, and knelt again.\n\nBut when she had risen, and before she could leave the space by the\naltar, Siur had stepped up to her, and seized her hurriedly, folding both\nhis arms about her; she let herself be held there, her bosom against his;\nthen he held her away from him a little space, holding her by the arms\nnear the shoulder; then he took her hands and laid them across his\nshoulders, so that now she held him.\n\nAnd they said nothing; what could they say?  Do you know any word for\nwhat they meant?\n\nAnd the father and brother stood by, looking quite awe-struck, more so\nthey seemed than by her solemn oath.  Till Siur, raising his head from\nwhere it lay, cried out aloud:\n\n'May God forgive me as I am true to her! hear you, father and brother?'\n\nThen said Cissela: 'May God help me in my need, as I am true to Siur.'\n\nAnd the others went, and they two were left standing there alone, with no\nlittle awe over them, strange and shy as they had never yet been to each\nother.  Cissela shuddered, and said in a quick whisper: 'Siur, on your\nknees! and pray that these oaths may never clash.'\n\n'Can they, Cissela?' he said.\n\n'O love,' she cried, 'you have loosed my hand; take it again, or I shall\ndie, Siur!'\n\nHe took both her hands, he held them fast to his lips, to his forehead;\nhe said: 'No, God does not allow such things: truth does not lie; you are\ntruth; this need not be prayed for.'\n\nShe said: 'Oh, forgive me! yet--yet this old chapel is damp and cold even\nin the burning summer weather.  O knight Siur, something strikes through\nme; I pray you kneel and pray.'\n\nHe looked steadily at her for a long time without answering, as if he\nwere trying once for all to become indeed one with her; then said: 'Yes,\nit is possible; in no other way could you give up everything.'\n\nThen he took from off his finger a thin golden ring, and broke it in two,\nand gave her the one half, saying: 'When will they come together?'\n\nThen within a while they left the chapel, and walked as in a dream\nbetween the dazzling lights of the hall, where the knights sat now, and\nbetween those lights sat down together, dreaming still the same dream\neach of them; while all the knights shouted for Siur and Cissela.  Even\nif a man had spent all his life looking for sorrowful things, even if he\nsought for them with all his heart and soul, and even though he had grown\ngrey in that quest, yet would he have found nothing in all the world, or\nperhaps in all the stars either, so sorrowful as Cissela.\n\nThey had accepted her sacrifice after long deliberation, they had arrayed\nher in purple and scarlet, they had crowned her with gold wrought about\nwith jewels, they had spread abroad the veil of her golden hair; yet now,\nas they led her forth in the midst of the band of knights, her brother\nEric holding fast her hand, each man felt like a murderer when he beheld\nher face, whereon was no tear, wherein was no writhing of muscle,\ntwitching of nerve, wherein was no sorrow-mark of her own, but only the\nsorrow-mark which God sent her, and which she _must_ perforce wear.\n\nYet they had not caught eagerly at her offer, they had said at first\nalmost to a man: 'Nay, this thing shall not be, let us die altogether\nrather than this.'  Yet as they sat, and said this, to each man of the\ncouncil came floating dim memories of that curse of the burned women, and\nits remedy; to many it ran rhythmically, an old song better known by the\nmusic than the words, heard once and again, long ago, when the gusty wind\novermastered the chesnut-boughs and strewed the smooth sward with their\nstar-leaves.\n\nWithal came thoughts to each man, partly selfish, partly wise and just,\nconcerning his own wife and children, concerning children yet unborn;\nthoughts too of the glory of the old name; all that had been suffered and\ndone that the glorious free land might yet be a nation.\n\nAnd the spirit of hope, never dead but sleeping only, woke up within\ntheir hearts: 'We may yet be a people,' they said to themselves, 'if we\ncan but get breathing time.'\n\nAnd as they thought these things, and doubted, Siur rose up in the midst\nof them and said: 'You are right in what you think, countrymen, and she\nis right; she is altogether good and noble; send her forth.'\n\nThen, with one look of utter despair at her as she stood statue-like, he\nleft the council, lest he should fall down and die in the midst of them,\nhe said; yet he died not then, but lived for many years afterwards.\n\nBut they rose from their seats, and when they were armed, and she royally\narrayed, they went with her, leading her through the dear streets, whence\nyou always saw the great pine-shadowed mountains; she went away from all\nthat was dear to her, to go and sit a crowned queen in the dreary marble\npalace, whose outer walls rose right up from the weary-hearted sea.  She\ncould not think, she durst not; she feared, if she did, that she would\ncurse her beauty, almost curse the name of love, curse Siur, though she\nknew he was right, for not slaying her; she feared that she might curse\nGod.\n\nSo she thought not at all, steeping her senses utterly in forgetfulness\nof the happy past, destroying all anticipation of the future: yet, as\nthey left the city amid the tears of women, and fixed sorrowful gaze of\nmen, she turned round once, and stretched her arms out involuntarily,\nlike a dumb senseless thing, towards the place where she was born, and\nwhere her life grew happier day by day, and where his arms first crept\nround about her.\n\nShe turned away and thought, but in a cold speculative manner, how it was\npossible that she was bearing this sorrow; as she often before had\nwondered, when slight things vexed her overmuch, how people had such\nsorrows and lived, and almost doubted if the pain was so much greater in\ngreat sorrows than in small troubles, or whether the nobleness only was\ngreater, the pain not sharper, but more lingering.\n\nHalfway toward the camp the king's people met her; and over the trampled\nground, where they had fought so fiercely but a little time before, they\nspread breadth of golden cloth, that her feet might not touch the arms of\nher dead countrymen, or their brave bodies.\n\nAnd so they came at last with many trumpet-blasts to the king's tent, who\nstood at the door of it, to welcome his bride that was to be: a noble man\ntruly to look on, kindly, and genial-eyed; the red blood sprang up over\nhis face when she came near; and she looked back no more, but bowed\nbefore him almost to the ground, and would have knelt, but that he caught\nher in his arms and kissed her; she was pale no more now; and the king,\nas he gazed delightedly at her, did not notice that sorrow-mark, which\nwas plain enough to her own people.\n\nSo the trumpets sounded again one long peal that seemed to make all the\nair reel and quiver, and the soldiers and lords shouted: 'Hurrah for the\nPeace-Queen, Cissela.'\n\n* * * * *\n\n'Come, Harald,' said a beautiful golden-haired boy to one who was plainly\nhis younger brother, 'Come, and let us leave Robert here by the forge,\nand show our lady-mother this beautiful thing.  Sweet master armourer,\nfarewell.'\n\n'Are you going to the queen then?' said the armourer.\n\n'Yea,' said the boy, looking wonderingly at the strong craftsman's eager\nface.\n\n'But, nay; let me look at you awhile longer, you remind me so much of one\nI loved long ago in my own land.  Stay awhile till your other brother\ngoes with you.'\n\n'Well, I will stay, and think of what you have been telling me; I do not\nfeel as it I should ever think of anything else for long together, as\nlong as I live.'\n\nSo he sat down again on an old battered anvil, and seemed with his bright\neyes to be beholding something in the land of dreams.  A gallant dream it\nwas he dreamed; for he saw himself with his brothers and friends about\nhim, seated on a throne, the justest king in all the earth, his people\nthe lovingest of all people: he saw the ambassadors of the restored\nnation, that had been unjustly dealt with long ago; everywhere love, and\npeace if possible, justice and truth at all events.\n\nAlas! he knew not that vengeance, so long delayed, must fall at last in\nhis life-time; he knew not that it takes longer to restore that whose\ngrowth has been through age and age, than the few years of a life-time;\nyet was the reality good, if not as good as the dream.\n\nPresently his twin-brother Robert woke him from that dream, calling out:\n'Now, brother Svend, are we really ready; see here! but stop, kneel\nfirst; there, now am I the Bishop.'\n\nAnd he pulled his brother down on to his knees, and put on his head,\nwhere it fitted loosely enough now, hanging down from left to right, an\niron crown fantastically wrought, which he himself, having just finished\nit, had taken out of the water, cool and dripping.\n\nRobert and Harald laughed loud when they saw the crown hanging all askew,\nand the great drops rolling from it into Svend's eyes and down his\ncheeks, looking like tears: not so Svend; he rose, holding the crown\nlevel on his head, holding it back, so that it pressed against his brow\nhard, and, first dashing the drops to right and left, caught his brother\nby the hand, and said:\n\n'May I keep it, Robert?  I shall wear it some day.'\n\n'Yea,' said the other; 'but it is a poor thing; better let Siur put it in\nthe furnace again and make it into sword hilts.'\n\nThereupon they began to go, Svend holding the crown in his hand: but as\nthey were going, Siur called out: 'Yet will I sell my dagger at a price,\nPrince Svend, even as you wished at first, rather than give it you for\nnothing.'\n\n'Well, for what?' said Svend, somewhat shortly, for he thought Siur was\ngoing back from his promise, which was ugly to him.\n\n'Nay, be not angry, prince,' said the armourer, 'only I pray you to\nsatisfy this whim of mine; it is the first favour I have asked of you:\nwill you ask the fair, noble lady, your mother, from Siur the smith, if\nshe is happy now?'\n\n'Willingly, sweet master Siur, if it pleases you; farewell.'\n\nAnd with happy young faces they went away; and when they were gone, Siur\nfrom a secret place drew out various weapons and armour, and began to\nwork at them, having first drawn bolt and bar of his workshop carefully.\n\nSvend, with Harald and Robert his two brethren, went their ways to the\nqueen, and found her sitting alone in a fair court of the palace full of\nflowers, with a marble cloister round about it; and when she saw them\ncoming, she rose up to meet them, her three fair sons.\n\nTruly as that right royal woman bent over them lovingly, there seemed\nlittle need of Siur's question.\n\nSo Svend showed her his dagger, but not the crown; and she asked many\nquestions concerning Siur the smith, about his way of talking and his\nface, the colour of his hair even, till the boys wondered, she questioned\nthem so closely, with beaming eyes and glowing cheeks, so that Svend\nthought he had never before seen his mother look so beautiful.\n\nThen Svend said: 'And, mother, don't be angry with Siur, will you?\nbecause he sent a message to you by me.'\n\n'Angry!' and straightway her soul was wandering where her body could not\ncome, and for a moment or two she was living as before, with him close by\nher, in the old mountain land.\n\n'Well, mother, he wanted me to ask you if you were happy now.'\n\n'Did he, Svend, this man with brown hair, grizzled as you say it is now?\nIs his hair soft then, this Siur, going down on to his shoulders in\nwaves? and his eyes, do they glow steadily, as if lighted up from his\nheart? and how does he speak?  Did you not tell me that his words led\nyou, whether you would or no, into dreamland?  Ah well! tell him I am\nhappy, but not so happy as we shall be, as we were.  And so you, son\nRobert, are getting to be quite a cunning smith; but do you think you\nwill ever beat Siur?'\n\n'Ah, mother, no,' he said, 'there is something with him that makes him\nseem quite infinitely beyond all other workmen I ever heard of.'\n\nSome memory coming from that dreamland smote upon her heart more than the\nothers; she blushed like a young girl, and said hesitatingly:\n\n'Does he work with his left hand, son Robert; for I have heard that some\nmen do so?'  But in her heart she remembered how once, long ago in the\nold mountain country, in her father's house, some one had said that only\nmen who were born so, could do cunningly with the left hand; and how\nSiur, then quite a boy, had said, 'Well, I will try': and how, in a month\nor two, he had come to her with an armlet of silver, very curiously\nwrought, which he had done with his own left hand.\n\nSo Robert said: 'Yea, mother, he works with his left hand almost as much\nas with his right, and sometimes I have seen him change the hammer\nsuddenly from his right hand to his left, with a kind of half smile, as\none who would say, 'Cannot I then?' and this more when he does smith's\nwork in metal than when he works in marble; and once I heard him say when\nhe did so, 'I wonder where my first left hand work is; ah!  I bide my\ntime.'  I wonder also, mother, what he meant by that.'\n\nShe answered no word, but shook her arm free from its broad sleeve, and\nsomething glittered on it, near her wrist, something wrought out of\nsilver set with quaint and uncouthly-cut stones of little value.\n\n* * * * *\n\nIn the council-chamber, among the lords, sat Svend with his six brethren;\nhe chief of all in the wielding of sword or axe, in the government of\npeople, in drawing the love of men and women to him; perfect in face and\nbody, in wisdom and strength was Svend: next to him sat Robert, cunning\nin working of marble, or wood, or brass; all things could he make to look\nas if they lived, from the sweep of an angel's wings down to the slipping\nof a little field-mouse from under the sheaves in the harvest-time.  Then\nthere was Harald, who knew concerning all the stars of heaven and flowers\nof earth: Richard, who drew men's hearts from their bodies, with the\nwords that swung to and fro in his glorious rhymes: William, to whom the\nair of heaven seemed a servant when the harp-strings quivered underneath\nhis fingers: there were the two sailor-brothers, who the year before,\nyoung though they were, had come back from a long, perilous voyage, with\nnews of an island they had found long and long away to the west, larger\nthan any that this people knew of, but very fair and good, though\nuninhabited.\n\nBut now over all this noble brotherhood, with its various gifts hung one\ncloud of sorrow; their mother, the Peace-Queen Cissela was dead, she who\nhad taught them truth and nobleness so well; she was never to see the\nbeginning of the end that they would work; truly it seemed sad.\n\nThere sat the seven brothers in the council chamber, waiting for the\nking, speaking no word, only thinking drearily; and under the pavement of\nthe great church Cissela lay, and by the side of her tomb stood two men,\nold men both, Valdemar the king, and Siur.\n\nSo the king, after that he had gazed awhile on the carven face of her he\nhad loved well, said at last:\n\n'And now, Sir Carver, must you carve me also to lie there.'  And he\npointed to the vacant space by the side of the fair alabaster figure.\n\n'O king,' said Siur, 'except for a very few strokes on steel, I have done\nwork now, having carved the queen there; I cannot do this thing for you.'\n\nWhat was it sent a sharp pang of bitterest suspicion through the very\nheart of the poor old man? he looked steadfastly at him for a moment or\ntwo, as if he would know all secrets; he could not, he had not strength\nof life enough to get to the bottom of things; doubt vanished soon from\nhis heart and his face under Siur's pitying gaze; he said, 'Then perhaps\nI shall be my own statue,' and therewithal he sat down on the edge of the\nlow marble tomb, and laid his right arm across her breast; he fixed his\neyes on the eastern belt of windows, and sat quite motionless and silent;\nand he never knew that she loved him not.\n\nBut Siur, when he had gazed at him for awhile, stole away quietly, as we\ndo when we fear to waken a sleeper; and the king never turned his head,\nbut still sat there, never moving, scarce breathing, it seemed.\n\nSiur stood in his own great hall (for his house was large), he stood\nbefore the dais, and saw a fair sight, the work of his own hands.\n\nFor, fronting him, against the wall were seven thrones, and behind them a\ncloth of samite of purple wrought with golden stars, and barred across\nfrom right to left with long bars of silver and crimson, and edged below\nwith melancholy, fading green, like a September sunset; and opposite each\nthrone was a glittering suit of armour wrought wonderfully in bright\nsteel, except that on the breast of each suit was a face worked\nmarvellously in enamel, the face of Cissela in a glory of golden hair;\nand the glory of that gold spread away from the breast on all sides, and\nran cunningly along with the steel rings, in such a way as it is hard\neven to imagine: moreover, on the crest of each helm was wrought the\nphoenix, the never-dying bird, the only creature that knows the sun; and\nby each suit lay a gleaming sword terrible to look at, steel from pommel\nto point, but wrought along the blade in burnished gold that outflashed\nthe gleam of the steel, was written in fantastic letters the word\n'Westward.'\n\nSo Siur gazed till he heard footsteps coming; then he turned to meet\nthem.  And Svend and his brethren sat silent in the council chamber, till\nthey heard a great noise and clamour of the people arise through all the\nstreets; and then they rose to see what it might be.  Meanwhile on the\nlow marble tomb, under the dim sweeping vault sat, or rather lay, the\nking; for, though his right arm still lay over her breast, his head had\nfallen forward, and rested now on the shoulder of the marble queen.  There\nhe lay, with strange confusion of his scarlet, gold-wrought robes;\nsilent, motionless, and dead.  The seven brethren stood together on a\nmarble terrace of the royal palace, that was dotted about on the baluster\nof it with white statues: they were helmetted, and armed to the teeth,\nonly over their armour great black cloaks were thrown.\n\nNow the whole great terrace was a-sway with the crowd of nobles and\nprinces, and others that were neither nobles or princes, but true men\nonly; and these were helmetted and wrapped in black cloaks even as the\nprinces were, only the crests of the princes' helms were wrought\nwonderfully with that bird, the phoenix, all flaming with new power,\ndying because its old body is not strong enough for its new-found power:\nand those on that terrace who were unarmed had anxious faces, some\nfearful, some stormy with Devil's rage at disappointment; but among the\nfaces of those helmed ones, though here and there you might see a pale\nface, there was no fear or rage, scarcely even any anxiety, but calm,\nbrave joy seemed to be on all.\n\nAbove the heads of all men on that terrace shone out Svend's brave face,\nthe golden hair flowing from out of his helmet: a smile of quiet\nconfidence overflowing from his mighty heart, in the depths of which it\nwas dwelling, just showed a very little on his eyes and lips.\n\nWhile all the vast square, and all the windows and roofs even of the\nhouses over against the palace, were alive with an innumerable sea of\ntroubled raging faces, showing white, upturned from the under-sea of\ntheir many-coloured raiment; the murmur from them was like the sough of\nthe first tempest-wind among the pines, and the gleam of spears here and\nthere like the last few gleams of the sun through the woods when the\nblack thunder-clouds come up over all, soon to be shone through, those\nwoods, by the gleam of the deep lightning.\n\nAlso sometimes the murmur would swell, and from the heart of it would\ncome a fierce, hoarse, tearing, shattering roar, strangely discordant, of\n'War!  War! give us war, O king!'\n\nThen Svend stepping forward, his arms hidden under his long cloak as they\nhung down quietly, the smile on his face broadening somewhat, sent from\nhis chest a mighty, effortless voice over all the raging:\n\n'Hear, O ye people!  War with all that is ugly and base; peace with all\nthat is fair and good.--NO WAR with my brother's people.'\n\nJust then one of those unhelmetted, creeping round about stealthily to\nthe place where Svend stood, lifted his arm and smote at him with a\ndagger; whereupon Svend clearing his right arm from his cloak with his\nleft, lifted up his glittering right hand, and the traitor fell to the\nearth groaning with a broken jaw, for Svend had smitten him on the mouth\na backward blow with his open hand.\n\nOne shouted from the crowd, 'Ay, murderer Svend, slay our good nobles, as\nyou poisoned the king your father, that you and your false brethren might\noppress us with the memory of that Devil's witch, your mother!'\n\nThe smile left Svend's face and heart now, he looked very stern as he\nsaid:\n\n'Hear, O ye people!  In years past when I was a boy my dream of dreams\nwas ever this, how I should make you good, and because good, happy, when\nI should become king over you; but as year by year passed I saw my dream\nflitting; the deep colours of it changed, faded, grew grey in the light\nof coming manhood; nevertheless, God be my witness, that I have ever\nstriven to make you just and true, hoping against hope continually; and I\nhad even determined to bear everything and stay with you, even though you\nshould remain unjust and liars, for the sake of the few who really love\nme; but now, seeing that God has made you mad, and that his vengeance\nwill speedily fall, take heed how you cast out from you all that is good\nand true-hearted!  Once more--which choose you--Peace or War?'\n\nBetween the good and the base, in the midst of the passionate faces and\nchanging colours stood the great terrace, cold, and calm, and white, with\nits changeless statues; and for a while there was silence.\n\nBroken through at last by a yell, and the sharp whirr of arrows, and the\ncling, clang, from the armour of the terrace as Prince Harald staggered\nthrough unhurt, struck by the broad point on the helmet.\n\n'What, War?' shouted Svend wrathfully, and his voice sounded like a clap\nof thunder following the lightning flash when a tower is struck.  'What!\nwar? swords for Svend! round about the king, good men and true!  Sons of\nthe golden-haired, show these men WAR.'\n\nAs he spoke he let his black cloak fall, and up from their sheaths sprang\nseven swords, steel from pommel to point only; on the blades of them in\nfantastic letters of gold, shone the word WESTWARD.\n\nThen all the terrace gleamed with steel, and amid the hurtling of stones\nand whizz of arrows they began to go westward.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe streets ran with blood, the air was filled with groans and curses,\nthe low waves nearest the granite pier were edged with blood, because\nthey first caught the drippings of the blood.\n\nThen those of the people who durst stay on the pier saw the ships of\nSvend's little fleet leaving one by one; for he had taken aboard those\nten ships whosoever had prayed to go, even at the last moment, wounded,\nor dying even; better so, for in their last moments came thoughts of good\nthings to many of them, and it was good to be among the true.\n\nBut those haughty ones left behind, sullen and untamed, but with a\nhorrible indefinable dread on them that was worse than death, or mere\npain, howsoever fierce--these saw all the ships go out of the harbour\nmerrily with swelling sail and dashing oar, and with joyous singing of\nthose aboard; and Svend's was the last of all.\n\nWhom they saw kneel down on the deck unhelmed, then all sheathed their\nswords that were about him; and the Prince Robert took from Svend's hand\nan iron crown fantastically wrought, and placed it on his head as he\nknelt; then he continued kneeling still, till, as the ship drew further\nand further away from the harbour, all things aboard of her became\nindistinct.\n\nAnd they never saw Svend and his brethren again.\n\n* * * * *\n\nHere ends what William the Englishman wrote; but afterwards (in the night-\ntime) he found the book of a certain chronicler which saith:\n\n'In the spring-time, in May, the 550_th_ year from the death of Svend the\nwonderful king, the good knights, sailing due eastward, came to a harbour\nof a land they knew not: wherein they saw many goodly ships, but of a\nstrange fashion like the ships of the ancients, and destitute of any\nmariners: besides they saw no beacons for the guidance of seamen, nor was\nthere any sound of bells or singing, though the city was vast, with many\ngoodly towers and palaces.  So when they landed they found that which is\nhardly to be believed but which is nevertheless true: for about the quays\nand about the streets lay many people dead, or stood, but quite without\nmotion, and they were all white or about the colour of new-hewn\nfreestone, yet were they not statues but real men, for they had, some of\nthem, ghastly wounds which showed their entrails, and the structure of\ntheir flesh, and veins, and bones.\n\n'Moreover the streets were red and wet with blood, and the harbour waves\nwere red with it, because it dipped in great drops slowly from the quays.\n\n'Then when the good knights saw this, they doubted not but that it was a\nfearful punishment on this people for sins of theirs; thereupon they\nentered into a church of that city and prayed God to pardon them;\nafterwards, going back to their ships, sailed away marvelling.\n\n'And I John who wrote this history saw all this with mine own eyes.'\n\n\n\n\nTHE CHURCHES OF NORTH FRANCE\n\n\nI--SHADOWS OF AMIENS\n\n\nNot long ago I saw for the first time some of the churches of North\nFrance; still more recently I saw them for the second time; and,\nremembering the love I have for them and the longing that was in me to\nsee them, during the time that came between the first and second visit, I\nthought I should like to tell people of some of those things I felt when\nI was there;--there among those mighty tombs of the long-dead ages.\n\nAnd I thought that even if I could say nothing else about these grand\nchurches, I could at least tell men how much I loved them; so that though\nthey might laugh at me for my foolish and confused words, they might yet\nbe moved to see what there was that made me speak my love, though I could\ngive no reason for it.\n\nFor I will say here that I think those same churches of North France the\ngrandest, the most beautiful, the kindest and most loving of all the\nbuildings that the earth has ever borne; and, thinking of their past-away\nbuilders, can I see through them, very faintly, dimly, some little of the\nmediaeval times, else dead, and gone from me for ever--voiceless for\never.\n\nAnd those same builders, still surely living, still real men, and capable\nof receiving love, I love no less than the great men, poets and painters\nand such like, who are on earth now, no less than my breathing friends\nwhom I can see looking kindly on me now.  Ah! do I not love them with\njust cause, who certainly loved me, thinking of me sometimes between the\nstrokes of their chisels; and for this love of all men that they had, and\nmoreover for the great love of God, which they certainly had too; for\nthis, and for this work of theirs, the upraising of the great cathedral\nfront with its beating heart of the thoughts of men, wrought into the\nleaves and flowers of the fair earth; wrought into the faces of good men\nand true, fighters against the wrong, of angels who upheld them, of God\nwho rules all things; wrought through the lapse of years, and years, and\nyears, by the dint of chisel, and stroke of hammer, into stories of life\nand death, the second life, the second death, stories of God's dealing in\nlove and wrath with the nations of the earth, stories of the faith and\nlove of man that dies not: for their love, and the deeds through which it\nworked, I think they will not lose their reward.\n\nSo I will say what I can of their works, and I have to speak of Amiens\nfirst, and how it seemed to me in the hot August weather.\n\nI know how wonderful it would look, if you were to mount one of the\nsteeples of the town, or were even to mount up to the roof of one of the\nhouses westward of the cathedral; for it rises up from the ground, grey\nfrom the paving of the street, the cavernous porches of the west front\nopening wide, and marvellous with the shadows of the carving you can only\nguess at; and above stand the kings, and above that you would see the\ntwined mystery of the great flamboyant rose window with its thousand\nopenings, and the shadows of the flower-work carved round it, then the\ngrey towers and gable, grey against the blue of the August sky, and\nbehind them all, rising high into the quivering air, the tall spire over\nthe crossing.\n\nBut from the hot Place Royale here with its stunted pollard acacias, and\nstatue of some one, I know not whom, but some citizen of Amiens I\nsuppose, you can see nothing but the graceful spire; it is of wood\ncovered over with lead, and was built quite at the end of the flamboyant\ntimes.  Once it was gilt all over, and used to shine out there, getting\nduller and duller, as the bad years grew worse and worse; but the gold is\nall gone now; when it finally disappeared I know not, but perhaps it was\nin 1771, when the chapter got them the inside of their cathedral\nwhitewashed from vaulting to pavement.\n\nThe spire has two octagonal stages above the roof, formed of trefoiled\narches, and slim buttresses capped by leaded figures; from these stages\nthe sloping spire springs with crocketted ribs at the angles, the lead\nbeing arranged in a quaint herring-bone pattern; at the base of the spire\ntoo is a crown of open-work and figures, making a third stage; finally,\nnear the top of the spire the crockets swell, till you come to the rose\nthat holds the great spire-cross of metal-work, such metal-work as the\nFrench alone knew how to make; it is all beautiful, though so late.\n\nFrom one of the streets leading out of the Place Royale you can see the\ncathedral, and as you come nearer you see that it is clear enough of\nhouses or such like things; the great apse rises over you, with its belt\nof eastern chapels; first the long slim windows of these chapels, which\nare each of them little apses, the Lady Chapel projecting a good way\nbeyond the rest, and then, running under the cornice of the chapels and\nouter aisles all round the church, a cornice of great noble leaves; then\nthe parapets in changing flamboyant patterns, then the conical roofs of\nthe chapels hiding the exterior tracery of the triforium, then the great\nclerestory windows, very long, of four lights, and stilted, the tracery\nbeginning a long way below the springing of their arches; and the\nbuttresses are so thick, and their arms spread so here, that each of the\nclerestory windows looks down its own space between them, as if between\nwalls: above the windows rise their canopies running through the parapet,\nand above all the great mountainous roof, and all below it, and around\nthe windows and walls of the choir and apse, stand the mighty army of the\nbuttresses, holding up the weight of the stone roof within with their\nstrong arms for ever.\n\nWe go round under their shadows, past the sacristies, past the southern\ntransept, only glancing just now at the sculpture there, past the chapels\nof the nave, and enter the church by the small door hard by the west\nfront, with that figure of huge St. Christopher quite close over our\nheads; thereby we enter the church, as I said, and are in its western\nbay.  I think I felt inclined to shout when I first entered Amiens\ncathedral; it is so free and vast and noble, I did not feel in the least\nawe-struck, or humbled by its size and grandeur.  I have not often felt\nthus when looking on architecture, but have felt, at all events, at\nfirst, intense exultation at the beauty of it; that, and a certain kind\nof satisfaction in looking on the geometrical tracery of the windows, on\nthe sweeping of the huge arches, were, I think, my first feelings in\nAmiens Cathedral.\n\nWe go down the nave, glancing the while at the traceried windows of the\nchapels, which are later than the windows above them; we come to the\ntransepts, and from either side the stained glass, in their huge windows,\nburns out on us; and, then, first we begin to appreciate somewhat the\nscale of the church, by looking up, along the ropes hanging from the\nvaulting to the pavement, for the tolling of the bells in the spire.\n\nThere is a hideous renaissance screen, of solid stone or marble, between\nchoir and nave, with more hideous iron gates to it, through which,\nhowever, we, walking up the choir steps, can look and see the gorgeous\ncarving of the canopied stalls; and then, alas! 'the concentration of\nflattened sacks, rising forty feet above the altar;' but, above that, the\nbelt of the apse windows, rich with sweet mellowed stained glass, under\nthe dome-like roof.\n\nThe stalls in the choir are very rich, as people know, carved in wood, in\nthe early sixteenth century, with high twisted canopies, and histories,\nfrom the Old Testament mostly, wrought about them.  The history of Joseph\nI remember best among these.  Some of the scenes in it I thought very\ndelightful; the story told in such a gloriously quaint, straightforward\nmanner.  Pharaoh's dream, how splendid that was! the king lying asleep on\nhis elbow, and the kine coming up to him in two companies.  I think the\nlean kine was about the best bit of wood-carving I have seen yet.  There\nthey were, a writhing heap, crushing and crowding one another, drooping\nheads and starting eyes, and strange angular bodies; altogether the most\nwonderful symbol of famine ever conceived.  I never fairly understood\nPharaoh's dream till I saw the stalls at Amiens.\n\nThere is nothing else to see in the choir; all the rest of the fittings\nbeing as bad as possible.  So we will go out again, and walk round the\nchoir-aisles.  The screen round the choir is solid, the upper part of it\ncarved (in the flamboyant times), with the history of St. John the\nBaptist, on the north side; with that of St. Firmin on the south.  I\nremember very little of the sculptures relative to St. John, but I know\nthat I did not like them much.  Those about St. Firmin, who evangelised\nPicardy, I remember much better, and some of them especially I thought\nvery beautiful; they are painted too, and at any rate one cannot help\nlooking at them.\n\nI do not remember, in the least, the order in which they come, but some\nof them are fixed well enough in my memory; and, principally, a bishop,\n(St. Firmin), preaching, rising out of a pulpit from the midst of the\ncrowd, in his jewelled cope and mitre, and with a beautiful sweet face.\nThen another, the baptising of the king and his lords, was very quaint\nand lifelike.  I remember, too, something about the finding of St.\nFirmin's relics, and the translation of the same relics when found; the\nmany bishops, with their earnest faces, in the first, and the priests,\nbearing the reliquaries, in the second; with their long vestments girded\nat the waist and falling over their feet, painted too, in light colours,\nwith golden flowers on them.  I wish I remembered these carvings better,\nI liked them so much.  Just about this place, in the lower part of the\nscreen, I remember the tomb of a priest, very gorgeous, with gold and\ncolours; he lay in a deep niche, under a broad segmental arch, which is\npainted with angels; and, outside this niche, angels were drawing back\npainted curtains, I am sorry to say.  But the priest lay there in cope\nand alb, and the gentle colour lay over him, as his calm face gazed ever\nat the angels painted in his resting place.  I have dim recollection of\nseeing, when I was at Amiens before, not this last time, a tomb, which I\nliked much, a bishop, I think it was, lying under a small round arch, but\nI forget the figure now.  This was in a chapel on the other side of the\nchoir.  It is very hard to describe the interior of a great church like\nthis, especially since the whitewash (applied, as I said, on this scale\nin 1771) lies on everything so; before that time, some book says, the\nchurch was painted from end to end with patterns of flowers and stars,\nand histories: think--I might have been able to say something about it\nthen, with that solemn glow of colour all about me, as I walked there\nfrom sunrise to sunset; and yet, perhaps, it would have filled my heart\ntoo full for speaking, all that beauty; I know not.\n\nUp into the triforium, and other galleries, sometimes in the church,\nsometimes in narrow passages of close-fitting stone, sometimes out in the\nopen air; up into the forest of beams between the slates and the real\nstone roof: one can look down through a hole in the vaulting and see the\npeople walking and praying on the pavement below, looking very small from\nthat height, and strangely foreshortened.  A strange sense of oppression\ncame over me at that time, when, as we were in one of the galleries of\nthe west front, we looked into the church, and found the vaulting but a\nfoot or two (or it seemed so) above our heads; also, while I was in the\ngalleries, now out of the church, now in it, the canons had begun to sing\ncomplines, and the sound of their singing floated dimly up the winding\nstair-cases and half-shut doors.\n\nThe sun was setting when we were in the roof, and a beam of it, striking\nthrough the small window up in the gable, fell in blood-red spots on the\nbeams of the great dim roof.  We came out from the roof on to the parapet\nin the blaze of the sun, and then going to the crossing, mounted as high\nas we could into the spire, and stood there a while looking down on the\nbeautiful country, with its many water-meadows, and feathering trees.\n\nAnd here let me say something about the way in which I have taken this\ndescription upon me; for I did not write it at Amiens; moreover, if I had\ndescribed it from the bare reminiscences of the church, I should have\nbeen able to say little enough about the most interesting part of all,\nthe sculptures, namely; so, though remembering well enough the general\neffect of the whole, and, very distinctly, statues and faces, nay, leaves\nand flower-knots, here and there; yet, the external sculpture I am\ndescribing as well as I can from such photographs as I have; and these,\nas everybody knows, though very distinct and faithful, when they show\nanything at all, yet, in some places, where the shadows are deep, show\nsimply nothing.  They tell me, too, nothing whatever of the colour of the\nbuilding; in fact, their brown and yellow is as unlike as possible to the\ngrey of Amiens.  So, for the facts of form, I have to look at my\nphotographs; for facts of colour I have to try and remember the day or\ntwo I spent at Amiens, and the reference to the former has considerably\ndulled my memory of the latter.  I have something else to say, too; it\nwill seem considerably ridiculous, no doubt, to many people who are well\nacquainted with the iconography of the French churches, when I talk about\nthe stories of some of the carvings; both from my want of knowledge as to\ntheir meaning, and also from my telling people things which everybody may\nbe supposed to know; for which I pray forgiveness, and so go on to speak\nof the carvings about the south transept door.\n\nIt is divided in the midst by a pillar, whereon stands the Virgin,\nholding our Lord.  She is crowned, and has a smile upon her face now for\never; and in the canopy above her head are three angels, bearing up the\naureole there; and about these angels, and the aureole and head of the\nVirgin, there is still some gold and vermilion left.  The Holy Child,\nheld in His mother's left arm, is draped from His throat to His feet, and\nbetween His hands He holds the orb of the world.  About on a level with\nthe Virgin, along the sides of the doorway, are four figures on each\nside, the innermost one on either side being an angel holding a censer;\nthe others are ecclesiastics, and (some book says) benefactors to the\nchurch.  They have solemn faces, stern, with firm close-set lips, and\neyes deep-set under their brows, almost frowning, and all but one or two\nare beardless, though evidently not young; the square door valves are\ncarved with deep-twined leaf-mouldings, and the capitals of the\ndoor-shafts are carved with varying knots of leaves and flowers.  Above\nthe Virgin, up in the tympanum of the doorway, are carved the Twelve\nApostles, divided into two bands of six, by the canopy over the Virgin's\nhead.  They are standing in groups of two, but I do not know for certain\nwhich they are, except, I think, two, St. James and St. John; the two\nfirst in the eastern division.  James has the pilgrim's hat and staff,\nand John is the only beardless one among them; his face is rather sad,\nand exceedingly lovely, as, indeed are all those faces, being somewhat\nalike; and all, in some degree like the type of face received as the\nlikeness of Christ himself.  They have all long hair falling in rippled\nbands on each side of their faces, on to their shoulders.  Their drapery,\ntoo, is lovely; they are very beautiful and solemn.  Above their heads\nruns a cornice of trefoiled arches, one arch over the head of each\napostle; from out of the deep shade of the trefoils flashes a grand leaf\ncornice, one leaf again to each apostle; and so we come to the next\ncompartment, which contains three scenes from the life of St. Honore, an\nearly French bishop.  The first scene is, I think, the election of a\nbishop, the monks or priests talking the matter over in chapter first,\nthen going to tell the bishop-elect.  Gloriously-draped figures the monks\nare, with genial faces full of good wisdom, drawn into quaint expressions\nby the joy of argument.  This one old, and has seen much of the world; he\nis trying, I think, to get his objections answered by the young man\nthere, who is talking to him so earnestly; he is listening, with a half-\nsmile on his face, as if he had made up his mind, after all.  These other\ntwo, one very energetic indeed, with his head and shoulders swung back a\nlittle, and his right arm forward, and the other listening to him, and\nbut half-convinced yet.  Then the two next, turning to go with him who is\nbearing to the new-chosen bishop the book of the Gospels and pastoral\nstaff; they look satisfied and happy.  Then comes he with the pastoral\nstaff and Gospels; then, finally, the man who is announcing the news to\nthe bishop himself, the most beautiful figure in the whole scene,\nperhaps, in the whole doorway; he is stooping down, lovingly, to the man\nthey have chosen, with his left hand laid on his arm, and his long robe\nfalls to his feet from his shoulder all along his left side, moulded a\nlittle to the shape of his body, but falling heavily and with scarce a\nfold in it, to the ground: the chosen one sitting there, with his book\nheld between his two hands, looks up to him with his brave face, and he\nwill be bishop, and rule well, I think.  So, by the next scene he is\nbishop, I suppose, and is sitting there ordering the building of a\nchurch; for he is sitting under a trefoiled canopy, with his mitre on his\nhead, his right hand on a reading-desk by his side.  His book is lying\nopen, his head turned toward what is going forwards.  It is a splendid\nhead and face.  In the photograph I have of this subject, the mitre,\nshort and simple, is in full light but for a little touch of shade on one\nside; the face is shaded, but the crown of short crisp curls hanging over\nit, about half in light, half in shade.  Beyond the trefoil canopy comes\na wood of quaint conventional trees, full of stone, with a man working at\nit with a long pick: I cannot see his face, as it is altogether in shade,\nthe light falling on his head however.  He is dressed in a long robe,\nquite down to his feet, not a very convenient dress, one would think, for\nworking in.  I like the trees here very much; they are meant for\nhawthorns and oaks.  There are a very few leaves on each tree, but at the\ntop they are all twisted about, and are thicker, as if the wind were\nblowing them.  The little capitals of the canopy, under which the bishop\nis sitting, are very delightful, and are common enough in larger work of\nthis time (thirteenth century) in France.  Four bunches of leaves spring\nfrom long stiff stalks, and support the square abacus, one under each\ncorner.  The next scene, in the division above, is some miracle or other,\nwhich took place at mass, it seems.  The bishop is saying mass before an\naltar; behind him are four assistants; and, as the bishop stands there\nwith his hand raised, a hand coming from somewhere by the altar, holds\ndown towards him the consecrated wafer.  The thing is gloriously carved,\nwhatever it is.  The assistant immediately behind the bishop, holding in\nhis hands a candle-stick, somewhat slantwise towards the altar, is,\nespecially in the drapery, one of the most beautiful in the upper part of\nthis tympanum; his head is a little bent, and the line made from the back\nof it over the heavy hair, down along the heavy-swinging robe, is very\nbeautiful.\n\nThe next scene is the shrine of some Saint.  This same bishop, I suppose,\ndead now, after all his building and ruling, and hard fighting, possibly,\nwith the powers that be; often to be fought with righteously in those\ntimes.  Over the shrine sits the effigy of the bishop, with his hand\nraised to bless.  On the western side are two worshippers; on the\neastern, a blind and a deaf man are being healed, by the touch of the\ndead bishop's robe.  The deaf man is leaning forward, and the servant of\nthe shrine holds to his ear the bishop's robe.  The deaf man has a very\ndeaf face, not very anxious though; not even showing very much hope, but\nfaithful only.  The blind one is coming up behind him with a crutch in\nhis right hand, and led by a dog; the face was either in its first\nestate, very ugly and crabbed, or by the action of the weather or some\nsuch thing, has been changed so.\n\nSo the bishop being dead and miracles being wrought at his tomb, in the\ndivision above comes the translation of his remains; a long procession\ntaking up the whole of the division, which is shorter than the others,\nhowever, being higher up towards the top of the arch.  An acolyte bearing\na cross, heads the procession, then two choristers; then priests bearing\nrelics and books; long vestments they have, and stoles crossed underneath\ntheir girdles; then comes the reliquary borne by one at each end, the two\nfinest figures in this division, the first especially; his head raised\nand his body leaning forward to the weight of the reliquary, as people\nnearly always do walk when they carry burdens and are going slowly; which\nthis procession certainly is doing, for some of the figures are even\nturning round.  Three men are kneeling or bending down beneath the shrine\nas it passes; cripples, they are, all three have beautiful faces, the one\nwho is apparently the worst cripple of the three, (his legs and feet are\nhorribly twisted), has especially a wonderfully delicate face, timid and\nshrinking, though faithful: behind the shrine come the people, walking\nslowly together with reverent faces; a woman with a little child holding\nher hand are the last figures in this history of St. Honore: they both\nhave their faces turned full south, the woman has not a beautiful face,\nbut a happy good-natured genial one.\n\nThe cornice below this division is of plain round-headed trefoils very\nwide, and the spandrel of each arch is pierced with a small round\ntrefoil, very sharply cut, looking, in fact, as if it were cut with a\npunch: this cornice, simple though it is, I think, very beautiful, and in\nmy photograph the broad trefoils of it throw sharp black shadows on the\nstone behind the worshipping figures, and square-cut altars.\n\nIn the triangular space at the top of the arch is a representation of our\nLord on the cross; St. Mary and St. John standing on either side of him,\nand, kneeling on one knee under the sloping sides of the arch, two\nangels, one on each side.  I very much wish I could say something more\nabout this piece of carving than I can do, because it seems to me that\nthe French thirteenth century sculptors failed less in their\nrepresentations of the crucifixion than almost any set of artists; though\nit was certainly an easier thing to do in stone than on canvas,\nespecially in such a case as this where the representation is so highly\nabstract; nevertheless, I wish I could say something more about it;\nfailing which, I will say something about my photograph of it.\n\nI cannot see the Virgin's face at all, it is in the shade so much; St.\nJohn's I cannot see very well; I do not think it is a remarkable face,\nthough there is sweet expression in it; our Lord's face is very grand and\nsolemn, as fine as I remember seeing it anywhere in sculpture.  The\nshadow of the body hanging on the cross there, falls strangely and\nweirdly on the stone behind--both the kneeling angels (who, by the way,\nare holding censers), are beautiful.  Did I say above that one of the\nfaces of the twelve Apostles was the most beautiful in the tympanum? if I\ndid, I retract that saying, certainly, looking on the westernmost of\nthese two angels.  I keep using the word beautiful so often that I feel\nhalf inclined to apologise for it; but I cannot help it, though it is\noften quite inadequate to express the loveliness of some of the figures\ncarved here; and so it happens surely with the face of this angel.  The\nface is not of a man, I should think; it is rather like a very fair\nwoman's face; but fairer than any woman's face I ever saw or thought of:\nit is in profile and easy to be seen in the photograph, though somewhat\nin the shade.  I am utterly at a loss how to describe it, or to give any\nidea of the exquisite lines of the cheek and the rippled hair sweeping\nback from it, just faintly touched by the light from the south-east.  I\ncannot say more about it.  So I have gone through the carvings in the\nlower part of this doorway, and those of the tympanum.  Now, besides\nthese, all the arching-over of the door is filled with figures under\ncanopies, about which I can say little, partly from want of adequate\nphotographs, partly from ignorance of their import.\n\nBut the first of the cavettos wherein these figures are, is at any rate\nfilled with figures of angels, some swinging censers, some bearing\ncrowns, and other things which I cannot distinguish.  Most of the niches\nin the next cavetto seem to hold subjects; but the square camera of the\nphotographer clips some, many others are in shadow, in fact the niches\nthrow heavy shadows over the faces of nearly all; and without the\nphotograph I remember nothing but much fretted grey stone above the line\nof the capitals of the doorway shafts; grey stone with something carved\nin it, and the swallows flying in and out of it.  Yet now there are three\nniches I can say something about at all events.  A stately figure with a\nking's crown on his head, and hair falling in three waves over his\nshoulders, a very kingly face looking straight onward; a great jewelled\ncollar falling heavily to his elbows: his right hand holding a heavy\nsceptre formed of many budding flowers, and his left just touching in\nfront the folds of his raiment that falls heavily, very heavily to the\nground over his feet.  Saul, King of Israel.--A bending figure with\ncovered head, pouring, with his right hand, oil on the head of a youth,\nnot a child plainly, but dwarfed to a young child's stature before the\nbending of the solemn figure with the covered head.  Samuel anointing\nDavid.--A king again, with face hidden in deep shade, holding a naked\nsword in his right hand, and a living infant in the other; and two women\nbefore him, one with a mocking smile on her face, the other with her head\nturned up in passionate entreaty, grown women they are plainly, but\ndwarfed to the stature of young girls before the hidden face of the King.\nThe judgment of Solomon.--An old man with drawn sword in right hand, with\nleft hand on a fair youth dwarfed, though no child, to the stature of a\nchild; the old man's head is turned somewhat towards the presence of an\nangel behind him, who points downward to something unseen.  Abraham's\nsacrifice of Isaac.--Noah too, working diligently that the ark may be\nfinished before the flood comes.--Adam tilling the ground, and clothed in\nthe skins of beasts.--There is Jacob's stolen blessing, that was yet in\nsome sort to be a blessing though it was stolen.--There is old Jacob\nwhose pilgrimage is just finished now, after all his doings and\nsufferings, all those deceits inflicted upon him, that made him remember,\nperforce, the lie he said and acted long ago,--old Jacob blessing the\nsons of Joseph.  And many more which I remember not, know not, mingled\ntoo with other things which I dimly see have to do with the daily\noccupations of the men who lived in the dim, far-off thirteenth century.\n\nI remember as I came out by the north door of the west front, how\ntremendous the porches seemed to me, which impression of greatness and\nsolemnity, the photographs, square-cut and brown-coloured do not keep at\nall; still however I can recall whenever I please the wonder I felt\nbefore that great triple porch; I remember best in this way the porch\ninto which I first entered, namely the northernmost, probably because I\nsaw most of it, coming in and out often by it, yet perhaps the fact that\nI have seen no photograph of this doorway somewhat assists the\nimpression.\n\nYet I do not remember even of this anything more than the fact that the\ntympanum represented the life and death of some early French bishop; it\nseemed very interesting.  I remember, too, that in the door-jambs were\nstanding figures of bishops in two long rows, their mitred heads bowed\nforward solemnly, and I remember nothing further.\n\nConcerning the southernmost porch of the west front.--The doorway of this\nporch also has on the centre pillar of it a statue of the Virgin\nstanding, holding the Divine Child in her arms.  Both the faces of the\nVirgin Mother and of her Son, are very beautiful; I like them much better\nthan those in the south transept already spoken of; indeed I think them\nthe grandest of all the faces of the Madonna and Child that I have seen\ncarved by the French architects.  I have seen many, the faces of which I\ndo not like, though the drapery is always beautiful; their faces I do not\nlike at all events, as faces of the Virgin and Child, though as faces of\nother people even if not beautiful they would be interesting.  The Child\nis, as in the transept, draped down to the feet; draped too, how\nexquisitely I know not how to say.  His right arm and hand is stretched\nout across His mother's breast, His left hangs down so that His wrist as\nHis hand is a little curved upwards, rests upon His knee; His mother\nholds Him slightly with her left arm, with her right she holds a fold of\nher robe on which His feet rest.  His figure is not by any means that of\nan infant, for it is slim and slender, too slender for even a young boy,\nyet too soft, too much rounded for a youth, and the head also is too\nlarge; I suppose some people would object to this way of carving One who\nis supposed to be an infant; yet I have no doubt that the old sculptors\nwere right in doing so, and to my help in this matter comes the\nremembrance of Ruskin's answer to what Lord Lindsay says concerning the\ninability of Giotto and his school to paint young children: for he says\nthat it might very well happen that Giotto could paint children, but yet\ndid not choose to in this instance, (the Presentation of the Virgin), for\nthe sake of the much greater dignity to be obtained by using the more\nfully developed figure and face; {156} and surely, whatever could be said\nabout Giotto's paintings, no one who was at all acquainted with Early\nFrench sculpture could doubt that the carvers of this figure here,\n_could_ have carved an infant if they had thought fit so to do, men who\nagain and again grasped eagerly common everyday things when in any way\nthey would tell their story.  To return to the statues themselves.  The\nface of the young Christ is of the same character as His figure, such a\nface as Elizabeth Browning tells of, the face of One 'who never sinned or\nsmiled'; at least if the sculptor fell below his ideal somewhat, yet for\nall that, through that face which he failed in a little, we can see when\nwe look, that his ideal was such an one.  The Virgin's face is calm and\nvery sweet, full of rest,--indeed the two figures are very full of rest;\neverything about them expresses it from the broad forehead of the Virgin,\nto the resting of the feet of the Child (who is almost self-balanced) in\nthe fold of the robe that she holds gently, to the falling of the quiet\nlines of her robe over her feet, to the resting of its folds between\nthem.\n\nThe square heads of the door-valves, and a flat moulding above them which\nruns up also into the first division of the tympanum, is covered with\nfaintly cut diaper-work of four-leaved flowers.\n\nAlong the jambs of the doorway on the north side stand six kings, all\nbearded men but one, who is young apparently; I do not know who these\nare, but think they must be French kings; one, the farthest toward the\noutside of the porch, has taken his crown off, and holds it in his hand:\nthe figures on the other side of the door-jambs are invisible in the\nphotograph except one, the nearest to the door, young, sad, and earnest\nto look at--I know not who he is.  Five figures outside the porch, and on\nthe angles of the door-jambs, are I suppose prophets, perhaps those who\nhave prophesied of the birth of our Lord, as this door is apportioned to\nthe Virgin.\n\nThe first division of the tympanum has six sitting figures in it; on each\nside of the canopy over the Virgin's head, Moses and Aaron; Moses with\nthe tables of the law, and Aaron with great blossomed staff: with them\nagain, two on either side, sit the four greater prophets, their heads\nveiled, and a scroll lying along between them, over their knees; old they\nlook, very old, old and passionate and fierce, sitting there for so long.\n\nThe next division has in it the death and burial of the Virgin,--the\ntwelve Apostles clustering round the deathbed of the Virgin.  I wish my\nphotograph were on a larger scale, for this indeed seems to me one of the\nmost beautiful pieces of carving about this church, those earnest faces\nexpressing so many things mingled with their regret that she will be no\nmore with them; and she, the Virgin-Mother, in whom all those prophecies\nwere fulfilled, lying so quiet there, with her hands crossed downwards,\ndead at last.  Ah! and where will she go now? whose face will she see\nalways?  Oh! that we might be there too!  Oh! those faces so full of all\ntender regret, which even They must feel for Her; full of all yearning,\nand longing that they too might finish the long fight, that they might be\nwith the happy dead: there is a wonder on their faces too, when they see\nwhat the mighty power of Death is.  The foremost is bending down, with\nhis left hand laid upon her breast, and he is gazing there so long, so\nvery long; one looking there too, over his shoulder, rests his hand on\nhim; there is one at the head, one at the foot of the bed; and he at the\nhead is turning round his head, that he may see her face, while he holds\nin his hands the long vestment on which her head rests.\n\nIn my photograph the shadow is so thick that I cannot see much of the\nburial of the Virgin, can see scarce anything of the faces, only just the\nforms, of the Virgin lying quiet and still there, of the bending angels,\nand their great wings that shadow everything there.\n\nSo also of the third and last division filling the top of the arch.  I\nonly know that it represents the Virgin sitting glorified with Christ,\ncrowned by angels, and with angels all about her.\n\nThe first row in the vaulting of the porch I has angels in it, holding\ncensers and candlesticks; the next has in it the kings who sprung from\nJesse, with a flowing bough twisted all among them; the third and last is\nhidden by a projecting moulding.\n\nAll the three porches of the west front have a fringe of cusps ending in\nflowers, hanging to their outermost arch, and above this a band of flower-\nwork, consisting of a rose and three rose-leaves alternating with each\nother.\n\nConcerning the central porch of the west front.--The pillar which divides\nthe valves of the central porch carries a statue of Our Lord; his right\nhand raised to bless, his left hand holding the Book; along the jambs of\nthe porch are the Apostles, but not the Apostles alone, I should think;\nthose that are in the side that I can see have their distinctive emblems\nwith them, some of them at least.  Their faces vary very much here, as\nalso their figures and dress; the one I like best among them is one who I\nthink is meant for St. James the Less, with a long club in his hands; but\nthey are all grand faces, stern and indignant, for they have come to\njudgment.\n\nFor there above in the tympanum, in the midst over the head of Christ,\nstand three angels, and the midmost of them bears scales in his hands,\nwherein are the souls being weighed against the accusations of the\nAccuser, and on either side of him stands another angel, blowing a long\ntrumpet, held downwards, and their long, long raiment, tight across the\nbreast, falls down over their feet, heavy, vast, ungirt; and at the\ncorners of this same division stand two other angels, and they also are\nblowing long trumpets held downwards, so that their blast goes round the\nworld and through it; and the dead are rising between the robes of the\nangels with their hands many of them lifted to heaven; and above them and\nbelow them are deep bands of wrought flowers; and in the vaulting of the\nporch are eight bands of niches with many, many figures carved therein;\nand in the first row in the lowest niche Abraham stands with the saved\nsouls in the folds of his raiment.  In the next row and in the rest of\nthe niches are angels with their hands folded in prayer; and in the next\nrow angels again, bearing the souls over, of which they had charge in\nlife; and this is, I think, the most gloriously carved of all those in\nthe vaulting.  Then martyrs come bearing their palm-boughs; then priests\nwith the chalice, each of them; and others there are which I know not of.\nBut above the resurrection from the dead, in the tympanum, is the reward\nof the good, and the punishment of the bad.  Peter standing there at the\ngate, and the long line of the blessed entering one by one; each one\ncrowned as he enters by an angel waiting there; and above their heads a\ncornice takes the shape of many angels stooping down to them to crown\nthem.  But on the inferno side the devil drives before him the wicked,\nall naked, presses them on toward hell-mouth, that gapes for them, and\nabove their heads the devil-cornice hangs and weighs on them.  And above\nthese the Judge showing the wounds that were made for the salvation of\nthe world; and St. Mary and St. John kneeling on either side of Him, they\nwho stood so once at the Crucifixion; two angels carrying cross and spear\nand nails; two others kneeling, and, above, other angels, with their\nwings spread, and singing.  Something like this is carved in the central\nporch at Amiens.\n\nOnce more forgive me, I pray, for the poor way in which I have done even\nthat which I have attempted to do; and forgive me also for that which I\nhave left undone.\n\nAnd now, farewell to the church that I love, to the carved\ntemple-mountain that rises so high above the water-meadows of the Somme,\nabove the grey roofs of the good town.  Farewell to the sweep of the\narches, up from the bronze bishops lying at the west end, up to the belt\nof solemn windows, where, through the painted glass, the light comes\nsolemnly.  Farewell to the cavernous porches of the west front, so grey\nunder the fading August sun, grey with the wind-storms, grey with the\nrain-storms, grey with the beat of many days' sun, from sunrise to\nsunset; showing white sometimes, too, when the sun strikes it strongly;\nsnowy-white, sometimes, when the moon is on it, and the shadows growing\nblacker; but grey now, fretted into black by the mitres of the bishops,\nby the solemn covered heads of the prophets, by the company of the risen,\nand the long robes of the judgment-angels, by hell-mouth and its flames\ngaping there, and the devils that feed it; by the saved souls and the\ncrowning angels; by the presence of the Judge, and by the roses growing\nabove them all for ever.\n\nFarewell to the spire, gilt all over with gold once, and shining out\nthere, very gloriously; dull and grey now, alas; but still it catches,\nthrough its interlacement of arches, the intensest blue of the blue\nsummer sky; and, sometimes at night you may see the stars shining through\nit.\n\nIt is fair still, though the gold is gone,  the spire that seems to rock,\nwhen across it, in the wild February nights, the clouds go westward.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes:\n\n\n{21}  See Thorpe's _Northern Mythology_, vol. ii, p. 214.\n\n{156}  In the explanatory remarks accompanying the engravings from\nGiotto's frescoes in the Arena Chapel, published by the Arundel Society.\nI regret not being able to give the reference to the passage, not having\nthe work by me.\n\n_Printed at_ THE AVON PRESS, _London_\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WORLD OF ROMANCE***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 17973.txt or 17973.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/7/9/7/17973\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
